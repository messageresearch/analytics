========================================
let's switch the order of service now as our brother comes out you can't hear it we're going to finish the order of service now as our brother comes out amen [Music] open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you [Music] open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy high and lifted up shining in the light of glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy [Music] yes your holy holy holy and i want to see you is that your desire then he'll make a way okay man good to see everybody in the house of the lord glad to have our visitor with us because i don't think she's been here before and we always say you come one time you're a visitor two times you're part of it so welcome and have a good time in it then but uh good to be in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures we'll try to get back where we were this morning into isaiah 59 and continue the thought on in the message remember wade will be ministering the lord willingness coming wednesday uh then when we get on down another couple of months i mean a couple of nights sundays we may be having some of the others to minister uh because we've gotta get to brother fournies we've gotta i've got a wedding coming up this week that's right this week yeah and then doing that and then we've got a lot of other things to do so we'll try to get it all into doing it and everything but isaiah 53 heavenly father we thank you for the grace and love that you've bestowed upon us and thank you for everything we ask you now that you would just be with us and that you'd guide us in your love and let your light shine into our hearts that we may follow into you and your word and just walk in the light and see the hour that we're living because that's the major point on our thoughts today is to see right where we're at and what's going on and we ask you to just have your way lord be with the sick ones among us remember the ones lord darby brother isles just to anand for lord for brother dale be with him and lord just touch him be with sister sister trudy and all of the different ones that are sick among us and needing our prayers and the older ones just to clean on them and their sisters are and the different ones among us and for brother colley brother daugherty and all this for everybody lord brother howell sister audrey and just have you away with all of us forgive our sins as one point we want to make sure we're always covered by the blood and just have your way let it it be you that would answer all of our prayers and our thoughts in jesus name amen so that's isaiah 50 9 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto and unto them that turned from transgressions in jacob saith the lord so to come to zion come to the bride zion is the bride the church you know the true bride as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth or out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of this thy seed seed saith the lord saith the lord from henceforth and forever you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we'll try to back up a little bit in our thoughts to not lose anyone but to to try to continue on and we'll take taking this part because i just decided to take a time while we were well i was kind of under the point because i didn't have any problems like i said i was a negative the whole time but my wife was positive so i couldn't i had to stay and take care of her and doing the the things and and you know being in the home there but the lord just took care of all of that but he gave me time to think things over and try to look up a few things and just you know meditate upon the hour that we're living and that's what i'm trying to get us to see even now the things that it's so prevalent that how could you turn against seeing it amen you know we're looking for this to happen we're looking for that to happen and right among us it's just going right along just as easy and everything's going right on time and and all like that and the churches and things everything's getting just right setting it up to where that uh all can be handled the government's getting it from there and that's what we'll be dealing with a little bit this not trying to be a doomsday but to be honest and straight as to the hour that we're living and what's taking place because satan is is running like a roaring lion but we promised because we read that so we're not that far down we're talking about what now persecution from persecution to revival now that's uh odd situation right because it it doesn't seem to fit but it does if we take it in the right order and follow it in line because as i said we you take each church age in each church age you would have a messenger come forth that would be a great revival it would run you know martin luther the just shall live by faith he preached that message but the reason he could come on the scene and do as he did was because of the depressions the persecutions and the things that had been prior to that it made the people to start thinking and they get just a little if you get a little thought in people's mind that's i found that out a long time ago i don't try to make them i don't try to get a big thought to you i've learned that that's hard to do sometimes because you you're trying to get a and i may think you know you may think i do because of the way that i preach and the way i go but i'm trying to get one little point because if i can get brother zach just one little point and see for a while he's going to think about that he's going to consider that he's going to go as like a like i've always said about you know you didn't think about the name being in the bible name you know you didn't think too much about it you know well there it is it's in there it's that way but then you come to to the point of you know getting baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ well see you get concerned of saying it's a name well you know what then every page you turn in the bible everything you look at it has got something about the name because that's that little thing that's clicked right just get that little thought and and get it to the people and it'll carry on because that's the way that it's supposed to be and it'll it'll run then in the right way so see luther he's seen what had happened to all the the church and what you know the systems was throughout there and coming up into that point and he's seen all of that and he he's cried out against it and when he did it started a revival in the hearts of the people so then it's not bad to think about that we're going through times of of persecution you say well we're not and we're not we're not being persecuted we're not uh dying for our faith and and doing but we're just being slowly gradually the devil's doing that too getting a little bit of something in there to make us think on and then and he's got it to go into where that you know you get that point in your mind of what he's doing it'll work the same way for him and he'll get his thought in and and all and you it just comes in so flattery you know because that's what the bible said he would do he'd come in by flattery come in so easy that means you invite him in and i remember years ago i i don't know about it now but the uh when i was thinking on that probably maybe 10 15 years ago something like i don't know but at that time the specific time the world the uh catholic church was not a member of the world council of churches he said well they started no they didn't started it they weren't a member of the world council churches at the time that's 20 30 years ago down the line see but they've been invited in because at that time they were people voted in to the church system that you know ministers and big guys with the names and to to be a part of it that were not even voted into the cattle they weren't they you know they they weren't supposed to be there that line they they brought them in by flattery to get everything to do with it and you say well now you know i mean hey we don't have the the guy that's the pope now i mean i have nothing against him he's not a he's not a um adolf hitler going out and killing everybody and doing this and that and the other he's a nice guy you know i mean things are going pretty good on a lot of scales and and stuff like that so it's not a something that's you know out of order so it's not something we're looking for something to be bad a big thing come up you know the image to the beast and stuff like that and we looked at it like i remember my brother was a baptist preacher brother-in-law excuse me was a baptist preacher and we were talking about the the great beast of revelations are you know that comes up and he's walking across the land you know and things and and i said what do you think about that you know he said yes and one of these days said there'll be a great big animal just stand up and just walk across the earth well i said a big old animal like a king kong and he said yeah i said that's what it'll be i said well where's the deceiving part i thought it was supposed to be a beast raise up and deceiving but see he had that beast as literal well we want to know by now it's not that way i told him i said where do you think a big king kong is going to deceive me i said no it'd be the best thing try to get rid of him but the thing of it is see we get our minds set by what we've been taught okay and and the people of this message has been taught some things you know that i've been against them from a very beginning in the basis of trying to get to people to see when brother branham is talking about something look at what he's talking about but remember he's talking about something related to me and you so let's get this thing to be important to us or the thoughts to us that's right you know what's going on in the land today i'm trying to get you to look at it that six months ago we had nothing to worry about we were everything was running you know i mean the economy was the best it had been in many years and things and it was just uh going grave and all at once it just you know well what had happened see the people of the end time message had turned down the message on the basis of what the prophet was teaching as it did then god is putting the church under persecution driver to her knees because that way she's going to do one or two she's going to get out or get in and you say well you mean god would do those things god will do things to try you and me to see if we're going to stand for the truth or not that's right he'll do that because that's his part because remember he's on the end of looking at it he knows the beginning for the ending he knows what you're going to do he he's not concerned well if i do this see i i say well if i said something brother donnie i might hurt his feelings and cause him to get mad at me and say god ain't that away god knows exactly what he's thinking right now and knows exactly what he'll think 10 years from now and and he knows all about it he don't have to worry about it he's got to figure out am i going to hurt her feelings because he's a pretty good uh oh brother gary atkins he's in the way he'd always say he said god is a is a good razor of children you know because the bible says you know raise up a child and wet she'll go or even says beat a child it won't die you know i mean you know the lord's pretty strong sometimes he he says it and means it and means it and you know we're supposed to follow it but all right but now that's what i'm getting at or what i was talking about we're trying to use some of the quotes this morning to bring it down to a point of thinking about that here we are in the last days now what are you expecting brother dale there's a great depression going on right now it's the world system and i'm talking about a full world system we were ending up our thoughts this morning see there has never been a time that there has been a uh depression etc uh whatever worldwide never been a time that there's been a uh plague or a virus or of because i can't pronounce them you i can't get all that in there straight so i call it a a you know just a a virus cause that's what it is you know but see it it's it's never been like this it's all over the world everybody is concerned with it some of those countries over there are just totally shut down now you just think about the the uh say because i don't know that much about it but had a little opportunity to be go back to jamaica well see you'd go there and you look around and you say hey their economy is built on people coming here as visitors tourists well you do away with that what have you got man they just busted i mean the poor old people they ain't got a thing they ain't got no hopes like my wife used to doing with gorge he said why don't they get up enough money and leave here and go to america i said where are you gonna get the money i said they can't make no money they're doing the best they can to even eat off the trees that's around here but now see that's my point looking at uh recessions and and depressions and things like that is a horrible thing we know that it's it's bad you know for people to be hungry and you just think of all of this and i mean my wife she uh you know darcy everybody know she was in the hospital twice during the times and because she got worried she couldn't breathe and things so i had to take her and uh i mean you know they put her right in and and uh you know the old day of going to the hospital first thing they've done is what iv start running the fluids right it doesn't matter what you're in there for they gotta have a bit you know you got that but they put her in there kept her overnight and everything else moved her from one place to the other they said never gave her about to eat she had to just about beg them to get some water to drink and they were telling them that they could not you know give her maybe these things or something because it it's it's what they was looking for and she was trying to tell us oh here's the sinus problems that's bothering me here and they say yeah but we're we're not interested in that that's not our concern we're concerned with the heart we're concerned with the lungs and those those things and said we can give you something to take care of those other but they never give her nothing sent her back home with nothing i mean literally she went upstate all night long the hospital came back not even an aspirin not even a thing they didn't give her nothing you know why because they run the test to see if she was positive and according to their book we don't do anything till we find out if she's positive then if she's positive we'll go do this when you think the world would never come to a place like that where that you would actually beg for something in a hospital and there she come out of the hospital and even though they proved the point of it you know of her being contagious as we call it they just sit at home they didn't give you no they didn't give us no guideline book they didn't tell us what to do they just put out the door they called me up hey i was at home because i couldn't go in that thing call me up come get me well then she got real sick again a few days later and i took her back to the hospital well they tried a little bit different things but still my point is they wound up with this virus thing that they've got now they've got books ways and things they're not going to do nothing they're not going to treat you call you if you're positive any of you has ever been positive or not but say if i'm positive or use positive call the doctor you can't go to the office they won't they will not allow you in the office you say oh yes they will they'll do i i can go down there and demand when i took my wife in the first time i walked in the door with her and i was lucky to do that because if we went in the front door it would have just been you up here right now let me just say like take your wife up there she's sick you walk up to the front door that's it you ain't going to see her until they dismiss her right he's all you're crying that's right come on go friend ask him about it it won't work they told me the guy told me he said you ain't gonna go no further well i didn't even get a chance to tell my wife goodbye because the lady called me told me to turn around what's your name i turned around here they're gone i didn't go in with her nowhere i went up there to get her i went back to the to the front door part of it and i mean they they rolled her right out the parking lot i told that lady i said well i'll go park and come back she said park your car right there said they'll be out here with her in a little bit okay i mean it wasn't me going into hospital and getting her to come out they rolled her right back out what's your point my point is one thing they're doing what they what they've got the books and lines and the things those guidelines have told them to do this check the heart check the lungs don't worry about nothing else do you know that every time you enter the hospital you're going to be tested you're tested for a virus as quick as you enter the hospital you say yeah but they can't do those things what are you going to do call your house of representative tilly nemesis hospital you understand my point is what we have reached a stage that i hope to god that it'll open the eyes to people that are at least listening to what i'm saying to the point of one thing we're at a place now they can do anything they want to do and there's nothing you can do about it i'll get me a lawyer he ain't getting in the hospital if he is he's tested for a virus and throws in the bed my wife are telling him i need something to drink i need some bathrooms right around there they didn't get her up and take her around there she had to go i mean they just why because it's the point that they just they're set to do what they're doing i ain't saying that the nurse is his problem see they just so shortcut until they had to do man i turned around when when i was looking for a wife i turned around and looked down through the hall oh my lord is all these people sick because all i could see for a hundred foot was people this is jesus it's like that you know and he said you're not going no further i didn't want to go no further but you understand my point my point is one thing don't get it in your mind that you are so special of people you are this you are that and you're not going to have problems and don't get it in your mind that god is going to daddy you like a a dodie old granddaddy he wants to know if his children will stand for the word that's right if he's got to put us through tests and trials he'll put us through it you remember the story i always tell of the two times in the bible there were you know if if a prophet come and give you a sign and it come to pass you're supposed to hear them but there's another one in earth he comes and gives you a sign and it comes to piss but he leads you to other gods don't hear him because i sent him among you to test you and try you i love to get those quotes where the prophet said god wants us the the devil to see who he's fighting against well i want him to know who i'm fighting i'm like this i'm sorry i'm just human and the way i talk is crazy i know it i'm i'm never mad at the devil old people say i'm so mad at the devil i'm just so mad at i just i would love to beat him up i would he love help being who he is and what he is he's doing a good job and you know what he's driving you to the lord amen amen he beat them children of israel until they was ready to leave egypt but you say yeah but i just can't see it well why not read your bible one time and see what you're talking about the things and you'll see that we're right here at the end well right here now at the point of what we looked at at times past and tried to figure out what did this mean what does that mean what is to come in the end time how is it to be what is to bring this to pisces and none of us had any idea when we read things we had a concept or a thought but no but now we're living it that's right that's you don't get nothing out of the message today get that one thing this has been on my heart for months and years really to try to get you to see where we are right now and that's not doomsday because that's what i titled a message to her that it would even the message title from persecution to revival but my approach is from what persecution is what drives us to our knees and driving us to the knees brings god on the scene and god coming on the scene he revives us so it's not to say we're glad for the doomsdays no i'm glad to have the truth for the doomsday that's right yes sir it may not mean a thing in the world to you but it's just like i said there this morning where i heard this brother had said that you know the bride wouldn't take none of these viruses the real true bride now i don't agree with it you know why because i watched my wife for two months going through horrible in and out of hospitals and all like that i believe she's a part of the bride of christ but i've seen that to word at it seemingly that pray and god wouldn't even seem to hear me i'd pray and ask him said lord have i done something wrong reveal to me is something wrong i'm her pastor yeah but you see sometimes then you'd have to just sit down and think and listen and eventually he'll find you somewhere and talk to you and you go through a couple of months with this horrible like but didn't come out of it thinking like this you know what to think that my wife was to the point that god could trust her to be what she's supposed to be and he would trust her and allow the devil to get after with all of his sicknesses and things because that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to be happy whatever takes place that's right and to realize then that satan cannot get to you and me when the enemy comes in like a flood it doesn't say the enemy comes through now when the enemy comes in like then god will raise up a standard that's right and that's what he's doing now see if we'll just listen to that and take it from there on and go and say all right satan bring it on it's nice to think that your name is thought of in heaven well ain't doing too good i'm sick it's like i told a lady one time i said the bible said all things to work together for good she said look you're telling me that said my husband is dead and said my son has stopped her she knows what i meant i mean the boy was a little off a little bit you know and said you say that that's that i'm supposed to be content well see she never thought anything whatsoever about what i was talking about the bible says whatever state you're in do you realize that that he would actually think enough of you to turn the devil loose on you but there's one thing he always says you can only go so far right only so far satan you ain't going to get his life you can do this you can take his family you can take all these things he said you ain't getting his wife because she was part of his life and they ain't getting you he can't take you down amen come on that's right we're to change our thoughts about what we're doing instead of thinking that we're oh we're pity by the way we didn't have so many problems i like brother foreign in that wowzy wowzy woo i want to get to hear that again i'm glad he's on he's up preaching we need him amen we need to ministry in this message to declare the thing and sometimes you got to go through a whole bunch of troubles and heartaches and trials to wind up with the right answer to be able to see but listen let's let's let's get a few more of these quotes we were doing this morning and then let's get to a thought all right let's go back to number nine that you was this morning uh oh yeah thank you i wrote my won't have a note and forgot it uh thank everybody for coming our you know our anniversary was uh thursday i mean a friday friday the seventh of this month and uh you know it was nice to have people to come when they know hey you got to stay over there because you're supposed to be contagious you know and you stay over there we come over here and we try to do the best we could to be not but to think that there was a lot of you chose to come that day and and fellowship our anniversary our 62nd anniversary now that's that's that was a good and i'm glad of you of you getting to come in to do okay all right let's go let's go to number let's pick up on number nine okay now we've done read maybe some of this but we'll get the point what are we trying what is our point what is our thought the bride of jesus christ we're not concerned with the jews we're not concerned with the foolish virgins we're not concerned with those things we're concerned with the things that are said in relation to the bride of jesus christ all right and the bride of jesus christ that there's going to be persecution brought upon the people that are even the true bride of christ but see that's where we think but god would not let us put go through these troubles and things that's where you don't know god that's right you think you do you don't know god he's doing that to try to make something out of us instead of tearing us down right now listen and what about that's what made me think of the wade was joking him the other day what about he lost everything multi-millionaire form as we call it today lost everybody that lost all of his kids lost everything he had yet when he finished he had a revival because he had double his animals and double his children right man and now you remember what that was not double his children i forgot how many had anybody had seven and died so see god gave him seven more not seven more numbers he didn't get 14 kids he made sure these you know this seven over and glory was his and this seven over here was he that's the 14 you get out of it you know and bring it because that was that was his point you know he gave him them all right so then let's look at the church system and see what's taking place and then we'll see just for a minute what what is going to be done in the future of that it is in this age that the churches are going to come together and as they even now are even now controlling world politics now you see what they're doing now they're controlling the politics okay they put in who they want to and take out who they want to all right they will soon control the finances of the world why because they're going to make a covenant all right and then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or sell you will lose all okay those who stay true to god and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church church orders will be physically beraff you know that's what i said you go ahead and do what you want to you say oh that's foolish virgins brother dale you just don't understand i just understand you're scared to death let me back up no way for nothing i know what fear is and i know what it'll do to you and you get that fear in your mind that there's something there that's not right you better get it right because fear is worse than anything in the world i'd rather face any line in the world than to see an act of fear because we could at least stand with god and say come on satan take me but you ain't gonna get all of me because there's something inside of here that you can't touch you can't move it from that listen so there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve god within the framework of the antichrist beast system they will give in to the flatteries and banishments of the hierarchy comes to mind brother tom brother tom fox bush he he saw the water baptism he was a methodist and i think that's right method yeah and uh so he goes and gets a an audience with a pastor and it's three or four thousand people you know so he got a chance to talk to him and he went in and he started talking to him and an old pastor was a good old pastor you know i could just see him now he just said he asked her and tom was telling him this was wrong and that was wrong yes sir yes sir and all i can tom he was just i'd got it walked out but tom's like here he said now what are you going to do about it and the guy said do about what he said what are you going to do about that water baptism he said i'm going to just have to stay with what my my church doctrine see it didn't make no difference what the word of god said it's going to be his church doctrine listen holding hands with the devil it is time to wake up and hear the voice of god okay run it on over let's go number 10. the false church groups will come together in a world council of churches this world council of churches is the image erected to the beast revelations 13 8 11 through 18 is run under there i cut that and splashed it but that's all right it's not taking nothing out this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control so you say oh well the churches don't control i'm glad you said that the churches don't control that's my point for the whole rest of the evening the church is not the control it's other people you've got to worry about the church it's the people you say well the people's the church okay what can i call you he says this ecumenical move will end up with rome at the head even though the people did not envision it that way how's it going up at the head they're going to vote him ahead now with it in the beasts and the things he you know they vote him in we give him the power we are the people that give the devil the power this is so because in revelation 17 3-6 it states that the mystery babylon is seated on the beast she is controlling the lies our fourth empire this roman catholic chur roman church is doing that with the world church system under her rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to the rome because rome controls the gold of the world now there's the key for the rest of for an hour now for we're going to hold women the gold of the world the catholic church back 61 i think it was they had 168 billion dollars ago brother joe gave me a readout of some things that goes with it and uh but you think of what that means today if 1960 gold was maybe might have been 100 an ounce but 60. i don't i know it used to be 35 an ounce is what it was and you think now what is 1500 or so an ounce and you take 168 billion and multiplied that by 1500 bill gates wouldn't have changed none of them got put them all together and they wouldn't have a chance that's what we're going to get to in a minute what i want you to see is there's something run in this thing this didn't happen haphazardly this virus didn't come into place haphazardly as a fellow out of texas out there i won't quote his name but he said that the thing of it was said the people the the money he said they don't see what that's doing that's that's doing it there see they're controlling it's not what you see it's not what's out in front of us the thing out in front of us is happy everything's running good it's what you don't see is the danger of what these things is meaning to all of us right watch now does all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand our head let me say this without a big life out of you three months ago you couldn't buy toilet paper now what in the world is my grandson got it from my wife about it well what in the world is toilet paper got to do with the virus right well you know you know i mean all at once we have toilet paper all at once toilet paper is going sky-high you can't even find it and then a virus hits what's them two got to do with each other that man said he said the chinese knew that they could force us into a worldwide depression some of you may heard him remember it said they knew they could force us into a depression you say what's toilet paper got to do with it right what's got to do with it it just shows it can be done right it's just showing it can be done you couldn't go to the store now come on folks something is going wrong here somebody tell me something because here we are in a day when all these big corporations big things it just shut down airplanes can't fly no more you can't do anything who's in charge i remember when they in the 50s that they had an anti-trust suit against general motors because general motors was bigger than the government and now the government just tell general motor shut down stop all the airplanes shut her down who gives orders somebody did but nobody'll stand up and say if they think china done this why have they not retaliated against china because they can't prove it come on you mean to tell me that china could come up and bring up all of these things and we won't throw a bomb down and we've done it in japan we done it back in world war ii because the country went against us we bombed them but you see somebody is pulling the strings it ain't just what you're looking at i want you to get that little thought in your mind and then just consider the rest of the day of what you're talking about rolling this great power the church system will persecute the true bride you say it ain't coming he said it so go ahead do what you want to this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and and truth to the people who need it but this is the part i love see that's why i don't i'm not a doomsday but he says it's going to come upon the true bride right you agree with that part up there it's going to come on now i can get this part and agree with it easily then but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system before he fully takes everything over of the churches the true bride will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride it's a great marriage supper we've got something to look forward to we got a wonderful thing laying right ahead of us all right but you've got to go through these steps to get there don't get caught up into the little steps of things you know walk as we walk i ain't going to the white house and say i'll tell you what let's jump now i got this thing figured out i want you to let me in here and up and get me on there and i'll i'll tell the world how to run everything don't want nobody tell them how to run it the guy that's smart enough to run it knows how he's running it and he's doing it it don't have to be one man see we've always looked at the antichrist as being one man remember you've got to have a people with a pope as head of to be an antichrist but not just by one not a pope you know that's right you can't do that you've got to have a system because he's going to stand out that's what i've always told you he's going to stand out and open and the people are going to be so happy about him oh any nice look how nice look what he's doing he's paying off all of our national debt because see the church ain't going to be mentioned that's what i want to get to if i miss it i'll get it later when i preach it it's the point the church ain't out in the open this image to the beast and thing is going to be made to work it will pay off our national debt which national debt would be the worldwide national debt of all the countries that are on the gold standard as i said this morning then if they got 168 billion dollars to go i don't see the vatican and them walking on the gold you know no no that's silly at one time general motors was larger than than the government all right general motors will say had a hundred billion dollars in assets you didn't look around and where's that no that's mine and that's mine that's my pile of million dollar bills that's my you see you're silly that's exactly what i'm trying to get who was it no walton you lost millions of being he said paperwork you don't mean a thing just paperwork you say well get on to watch it okay let's get on to what we're doing come on where are we at we're on number which one i think we're on 10 or 11. all right let's go to 11. now watch him this is from the message spoken word of the original seat now i believe with all my heart that's the way it'll wind up there will be like a union a boycott all such places as this here will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you've got a prim permission or a license from this federation of churches to hold a service it's almost as shows it does that now even in the denomination shows where it's at yes sir you have to have it and that's where it'll wind up at that's my prediction now listen to it that's what i don't mind giving all the holy what i said because i'm trying my best you ain't gonna come up well brother dale i found one you didn't find out that's the prediction now i'm going to show you the prophet said the prediction but i'd rather have the prophet's prediction then your thus saith the lord and you hurt feelings right put them in a seat in the bridge and sit down listen and that's where it'll wind up at that's my prediction as a servant of christ through the understanding that i have of the word and the inspiration that's where he'll come the all signs are pointing to the end i just got through speaking on that and it's even to the the unwise virgins with the beginning and i'll go ahead and run it on up and thank you no okay go ahead then number 12. this is from a super sign 62. let me make a prediction i'm not prophesying i'm predicting okay i predict that in the next few years that all organizations organization religions will be forced to take a stand and they will have a union of churches and a great boycott will follow this union of churches all denominations will be forced into it all of them if they don't there will be a horrible boycott nearly every one of them today has not knowingly joined the that world council of churches selling their birthrights protestants brothers with a mother catholic rome they'll do that you know the bible said that the tires will be bound bonnell first they are bundling all in one great group the bible said they would make an image unto the beast i believe it will come in come to price that shortly that if people do not join some organization some churches go into their own doors will be closed okay let's go got a couple more then i want to slam the one and we'll quit then questions and answers 1959 then the dragon spurts water out of his mouth to make war with the remnant of the seed that's when you you protestant churches under the federal federal federation of churches which is the image to the beast which is now being formed and there will be a boycott upon all churches like this like we're in a great tax gathering right now here now now that's him because remember what there was they had the tax case against him okay listen like we're in the great tax gathering right here now a dispute trying to say that there we're not a church we've got a constitutional right to say that we're a church all right come on wrote enough we've broken every constitutional law that they can break and soon the federation of churches which all the churches and the denominations are invited into and the devil's got in and making worldliness and everything else in local churches members so forth like that and great congregations and classes in society when the little old church is still down yonder now i like that one even though all that's going on what's happening little old church is still down yonder being born again in a mess like any birth is still paying the price still getting down and dying out acting the same way it's in this day all right go ahead to the next one mark of the beast on today and the seal of god is the holy spirit to reject it is the mark of the beast ever who sees the holy ghost that you're supposed to receive it and don't do it automatically you take the mark of the beast and see how easy if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost today you've got the mark of the beast no i ain't got the mark of the beast on me boy i tell you what no you don't even know what the mark of the beast is he just told you the mark of the beast is to reject the baptism of the holy ghost there ain't no stamps and this idea is that ideas come on automatically you'll take the mark of the beast because there's only two classes to exist right okay go ahead 14. therefore there are uniting they are uniting themselves now and your pastor here and many can tell you that's reading that they are how the economical movement of the world and then there's a lutheran minister over it that if there there comes a disaster would happen in this neighborhood here if we are not united with that economical move then our churches can no more be churchy no more be church and they can use it for our storehouse or if one of us brothers would see somebody dying or hurt and try to minister to him any spiritual blessings we could be shot for it exactly right we could be given 10 years in federal prison to ministering to the sick i think that's in where we're at so go ahead and roll what are we on fifteen okay and he's talking about the kings of the earth so roll it on that door wine and what it is and all scarlet in the bible represents royals or color scarlet means red and beast represents power did you notice the beast come up out of the sea that was in the revelations the 13th and when you see the beast coming up out of the sea it's meant that this power was raising up among the people okay now listen but in revelation 13 when this lamb came up he came up out of the earth no people united states that was the whole thing but then after he had two little horns civil and ecclesiastical power and then he received power and spoke of like a dragon did before you just got to mark it down we are coming into a religious persecution with the same thing that they did in pagan rome many years ago for it's thus saith the lord okay now what's it settling upon a beast of power okay now look at the next one and then we'll try to get to our thought for the time all right because this is there is a man here that can turn on the lives 1963. now they we're on this 91 this is one right for that cause it's a cult we're going to close up you have to be one of them or not you're either in that or you can't do nothing can't even buy or sell that's it you're dyson to pay for the pray for the sick and if you're caught ministering to any of the sick or any person with any script script spiritual thing in there you're subject to a federal law to be executed that's exactly right the you know that that's right it's in their papers yes sir and you cannot do it you have to be to be to belong to the cult you have to belong to the cult now cult is anything that's not a accepted practice there ain't no accepted practice of what they're doing all right roll it on up on to get this next one then we'll just preach for a minute off the message the statue of perfect man see how that deceit what they're trying to do give money away to buy one they're trying to break it and then that's something that you think about what he's talking about he's talking about we we're friends now now where you think with me i know i'm carnal but think with me we think that china brought up something of this or had something to do with this virus did they stop buying from china you know that china's in charge of most of his medication now why didn't they immediately if they could stop every airplane in the iron 45 minutes why didn't trump as quick as that happen say and cut off all connections to china no even though you think that's your crook he's the one that pulled the plug he's the one that blowed us up it's just not there's something else behind this thing more than what you're thinking somebody's behind it not not what you're looking at you see they're trying to break it's on the gold standard and the catholic church the hierarchy owns the gold of the world someone says 168 billion dollars 168 billion there you are throw her right back on the gold standard and you people just keep your homes and things but you belong to the catholic church the nation belongs to the catholic church right now you can argue with him that's what i said you know what really to me and i'm so sorry and ashamed of the fact of doing it but you realize that when you expose error that people are going to make a choice they'll make a choice when you expose error people will make a choice and they'll say i don't agree with you well if you don't agree what i just read then you're saying you don't agree with brother brown oh i agree what he said well he just said those are right back on the gold standard now the gold standard is the only thing that gold is on things acceptable for paying debts you know what i'm talking about you don't pay debts with with money you pay debts with backing of whether you got the gold or not all right now for a few minutes i want to take that thought brother random emphatically i've got them if you want them you'll be glad to give them to you or you're talking about that the catholic church will pay off the national debt well that's where i had my ideas set more on and they still are i'll get to that of the church and the catholic church paying debts no it's the national debt of the entire world that's being concerned right now not where the catholic is going to give us we don't need no money for catholic churches but now listen for a minute because you wind up and sell your birthright by falling after the gold the jews have the stocks and bonds all right now they have gold and all don't miss just get the profit what he's saying but rome has the gold it's not rome as a nation of rome right it's kind of funny that that little place over there called the vatican is not even a nation it's a nation of its own self but now listen one of these days we know the bible says that there'll be a covenant made between the jews and the antichrist all right they're going to pay off the national debt well you've heard him tell it over and over he said you thank them to back accompany people and it's that and the others going to wind up and and uh do away with the monies and this and the other or do it a sensible way like castro did he come in done away with everything took in the bonds burned him and done all kind of thing made new money and started it over he said you think they're going to do it here he said no they're not going to do that here he said because these brown and tobacco companies own too many millions of dollars and they're not going to do it so what's it going to do they're going to pay off our national debt national debt not of the church i hope that clicks in you because maybe it would i know listen i got a little sense i know they pay the national debt but i always looked in that national debt and i'm still looking at it suppose we'll get to that in a second there is a connection in the national debt because if they pay off our national debt then we don't owe nothing because church is going to be great we don't know nothing this would be automatic to be in the church but my point was just looking at it like they're going to pay off a church is dead churches don't have any debt it's the world system and who controls the world system i don't have to worry about the government getting an anti-trust suit against me how about you donnie uh are you you think they better be careful what they're doing because they you've got more money than they got oh no no you say well that's silly that's true instead of you getting your eyes on one man as the pope as this whole thing has taken place why don't you get your eyes on a system a system that has everything set to where they can pay it off and now i wouldn't name the guys but you know what i'm talking about take the illuminati you go home and get this what you call it we a thing of fortune they have 400 500 billionaires and you know what's so funny to me when it happened i read this one day in the paper and i said or not it's dying laughing this is a few years ago when russia went fail you know that there's more billionaires in russia now in the united states now that was according to the news when russia went down there's more billionaires in russia putin has his own hundred airplanes he's got his own army those people are filthy rich we think of them as pulpers no think of your super rich you name them in your mind without having a name put it on tape or does that and you'd get this one wrong this and this and my dad and it's done that hasn't done that and you got what 50 we'll call it as a number of people who have hundreds of billions of dollars in assets which are backed by bonds are money won i mean it all's got to be backed by bonds because that's lifts you apart but then you do away with the bonds what are you saying we better be looking for who the big guy is instead of fooling with a little puppy dog because the little puppy dog he might bite you in the heels but the guy that's got to control you mean they can tell you you can't sell toilet paper they can tell you that this that or the other but it's the national debt that we owe not just the national debt of america that's the part we're concerned with the national debt of the entire world that's on the gold standard like i said two or three times isn't it odd all of this virus is struck all over the world the national economy is going down because all over the world every nation is failing let it keep rolling for a little while how many trillions have we borrowed since they started the virus you realize what a trillion is i can't think that way how many billions it takes to make a trillion a hundred billion to make a trillion or something somebody give me numbers that's but anyhow trillion is higher okay one thousand one thousand billion one thousand billion anyway my goodness and they've already borrowed what we already had before this started we were already 10 or 13 i remember enough 17 trillion was already our national debt before anything started now they've added we'll say another 10 trillion this is a number how in the world are you going to pay that off it's the prime time for the antichrist to step in now amen and take over and pay off our national debt well all right now that's who you belong to they what you want to i'll tell you what i'm i'm missing i'm my own man i'm that's okay but if you can't buy a roll of toilet paper you order to learn a little bit and i don't make that as a joke i just make it it's so silly it's because something happened somebody wound up with toilet paper involved well what if you owned all the toilet paper on there and what would you do if you owned all the toilet paper i just raised the price of toilet paper and then i'd be an instant trillionaire and billionaires i'm just making a point forgive me taking a little time to just talk to you about it we're sitting in the worst depression that has ever been when any move whatsoever now determines whether we exist another month you think you're going to take away this thing now that you've already said in the mind of the people that if they get sick they just got to tell their boss i don't feel good he says well go home government will pay your pay they go home get paid what's going to happen if they stop that or old people going to have no way to go they've got us right where they want it this is the end the beginning of the end they can call in anything they want to it doesn't matter what you've got in the bank i'll show you one in here where brother brown says they have the paper he's talking about the the bonds and the and the the cash and he said and they have the paper that they can change the money well that guy out of texas they asked him one day he asked a fellow big man and said they're talking about changing the plastic you know going to credit cards right he said how long would that take to enact he said overnight you got a pocket full of money you got ten thousand dollars in your hip pocket and mud i'll tell you that's what tom was i ain't throwing on him because he didn't gone but uh he talking about like a man that guilt they asked him one day he was selling his son was was uh paying somebody for buying a house and the son couldn't the bank wouldn't let him have the money instantly and you know the daddy looked over at those shorty standards and then was he looked over at him and said daddy you got any money he said how much is it a lot of money then about thirteen thousand dollars he just pulled out his billfold you know and just laid out the money you know he had it with him you know you think you got that all they got to declare you remember here a few months ago when that one of those big guys overseas in the church they called in all of that money and we'll say 100 bills they called it in he brought in millions that he had stored up and had them just sitting in a room millions of dollars they took every one of them was nothing they could do well they can't get my money well i don't believe in burning it but it'd probably be a good thing to do you know i'm just trying to be straight to get you to think one thing about what's going on today the world today is in the very primest time that it could have ever been for the antichrist to take over and pay off the debts and pay off the thing they pay our national debts off and when they do we belong to them and you can't buy or sell without having their card it's stones but we'll just fight fight what come on all over the whole world not just one country in troubles all over the whole world come on musician think on these things they have the gold they have the bonds the contract between the antichrist and the jews will not be seen i'm quoting brother branham will not be seen by the bride of jesus christ i'm glad for that i believe that all right but it don't mean it can't be made or set in order then because i did learn a little bit tony and us could tell you a little bit about general motors when they they come in and they voted in a new contract that was not we get on the news and they'd say oh general motors and them has reached an agreement on the contract they got a contract you don't have a contract until you've got to rank and file rank and file voted the contract to accept it or reject it if they rejected that contract they went back and started contracting again they what are you saying they can do what they want to and ain't nothing you can do well i'll just get me a gun and i'll go out here help yourself we'll see you down to jail if you live well what are you going to do i'll find that quote in there and i'll give it back to you we're running around and says you'll meet in homes you're meeting old store buildings in places but you won't be telling nobody you're going to have a meeting because you don't dare do that you say yeah but we can't travel no but we may be able to get together where we're at we will serve god if you understand what i mean all of these things is not bringing me to a down and out situation it's bringing me to a place of understanding one thing when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard because when that happens out there and all those things start pounding on us in the wrong way god will move on the scene i'm in there i'm in that point on stay in that point he will always take care of his people you don't have to worry about it if you're hungry just speak it you don't have to worry about it all of that is in order amen think on these things maybe i've been slamming around all day long enough for you to get something out of it but i'm looking for the greatest revival that has ever been in the world because if you understand why i keep emphasizing the whole world is in a depression well you know what the little bride is around the world maybe little groups here little groups are around the world little people down here in this place little people there serving god she ain't forsaken he's going up let's stand father we've tried to make it plain and i know we're just sorry but you take it and you make it plain we're not doomsdays we're honoring glory your name because you've told us what'll take place we know what to look for we know to know and to realize that you'll be right there when we have need of we don't have to worry about it because you always are it may look bad it may look horrible but yet who worries about what it looks like is what you are what you've said we love you and we thank you be with the people on the way home and said lord consider these things and just let it be in their mind and thinking lord we're trying to get one thing send the persecution because there'll be a revival follower thereafter and we love you and we thank you in jesus name and listen what we got that sounds like home to me like where i want to be [Music] for persecution [Music] with the spirit pouring down to open that word [Music] back where i was are you worried [Music] we're not thinking about coming 50 years of studying one prophet's message with the story you say yeah but you got conjured up show me come on i'll at least do that you come and show me the contradictions in this message would you be willing to take them when i show you where you're contradicted [Music] glory [Music] [Music] how can you be happy when you see things are coming upon us because i know god will be there [Music] anybody have a need if anything i mean let's pray together remember we'd be doing wednesday and next weekend we'll see how everything works the next couple of weekends we're going to be jumping around doing things and all like that we've got a wedding to do and all that we've got brother forney wants us to come and dedicate his church and we don't want to do that we're just going to drive up on a sunday where we won't take up nothing to be no we'll be we'll be careful we'll go up on sunday and ride right back dedicated church we just won't be tied up into everything and put us in a position with just us trust the lord but thank you for taking over and doing and being in the times when we needed you father that truly does sound like home to me that i could depend upon you i can trust you i can know that you have everything in charge it doesn't make no difference what all of these things are doing we're not concerned with that we're concerned with you lord we're not concerned with who that will come forth and all this will be antichrist these things and all we're concerned with one thing and that's to come to the place of loving you and cherishing your love and your glory unto truth bless the people be with everybody on the way home give us a safe journey and let your grace be there in jesus name amen you're just missed wait a minute all right only me and wednesday okay everybody got it the ones that are announced to come just for the men and everything then we have to have one stand-in up here but she represents all the rest of them just remember that remember pray one for another okay you're just me remember to wear your mask [Music] that sounds like home to me like where i want to be
