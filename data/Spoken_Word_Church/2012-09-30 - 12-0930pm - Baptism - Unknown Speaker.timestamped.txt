[0:00] bless our brother as he as he goes into
[0:02] the water and comes out a new man W he
[0:05] performs
[0:07] ceremony amen all right now I know we
[0:12] uh we like to read the scripture every
[0:15] time but it always to me it brings more
[0:16] and more back to what uh to what this is
[0:19] all about it's not just that we're going
[0:21] to uh bury our brother and baptism and
[0:24] welcome him into the family but we're
[0:26] going to to help him amen help him get a
[0:31] fresh Good Start help him to get like
[0:35] brother was talking today about
[0:37] receiving the Holy Ghost you you take
[0:39] all these promises and you you make
[0:40] those you put those promises in the
[0:42] Bible and once you do you say God you
[0:44] promised right here right so you promis
[0:47] if I would be baptized in the name of
[0:48] Jesus Christ that you'd give me the Holy
[0:50] Ghost there's not a promise out of that
[0:53] okay the promise is if youd be baptized
[0:55] in the name of Jesus Christ I'll give
[0:56] you the Holy Ghost but we also know that
[0:58] we walk in newness of life that's what
[1:00] we always try to say is when when when
[1:02] we put the old man down um there's a lot
[1:05] of dead devils in this
[1:07] water we hope we pray and we've seen it
[1:10] before lot of dead Devils standing in
[1:12] here Le and them have to leave the pool
[1:14] on all the time to get all get all them
[1:16] demons out of there but now this is a
[1:19] symbol but then when you come up you got
[1:20] to walk in uness of Life the water's not
[1:22] going to wash your sins away but
[1:24] believing that you'll do what God Said
[1:27] Glory believing in what God Said that's
[1:30] what'll do away with your sin right not
[1:33] just being wet and coming back up you
[1:35] walk in newness of life so let's read
[1:37] the scripture here in Romans chapter 6
[1:40] and what a privilege we have
[1:42] today to take our brother to the water
[1:45] there's always been a privilege to to do
[1:47] this this part what shall we say then
[1:50] shall we continue in sin this is Romans
[1:53] 6 verse1 shall we continue in sin that
[1:56] God May abound that Grace May abound
[1:59] Paul said God for forbid how shall we
[2:01] that are dead to sin live any longer
[2:03] therein what in
[2:05] sin know ye not that so many of us as we
[2:08] baptized into Jesus Christ we're
[2:10] baptized into his death death burial
[2:14] Resurrection therefore we are buried
[2:16] with him by baptism into death that like
[2:19] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[2:21] the glory of the father even so we also
[2:23] should walk in newness of life for if we
[2:27] have been planted together in the
[2:28] likeness of his death
[2:30] we shall also in the likeness be also in
[2:33] the likeness of his resurrection knowing
[2:37] this that our old man that's what we put
[2:40] in this water the old
[2:42] man is crucified with him that the body
[2:45] of sin might be
[2:47] destroyed brother not just divorced not
[2:50] just hung up in a closet the Bible says
[2:53] destroyed that the body of sin might be
[2:56] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[2:58] serve sin for he that is dead is free
[3:01] from sin can't can't convict a dead man
[3:05] he's dead right he can't do those things
[3:08] anymore now if we be dead with Christ we
[3:10] believe that we shall also live with him
[3:13] knowing that Christ being raised from
[3:14] the dead dieth no more death has no more
[3:17] dominion over him that's the one
[3:20] scripture we need to hang on to right
[3:21] there death has no more dominion what
[3:24] what is Dominion overseer power there's
[3:27] no more power over us for in that he
[3:31] died he died under sin once but in that
[3:34] he
[3:35] liveth he liveth under God likewise
[3:37] reckon you also yourselves to be dead
[3:39] indeed into sin but Alive With God
[3:42] through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not
[3:45] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[3:47] that you should obey it and the lust
[3:49] thereof neither yield ye your members as
[3:51] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[3:53] but yield yourself unto God as those
[3:56] that are alive from the dead and your
[3:57] members as instruments of righteousness
[4:00] unto God brother
