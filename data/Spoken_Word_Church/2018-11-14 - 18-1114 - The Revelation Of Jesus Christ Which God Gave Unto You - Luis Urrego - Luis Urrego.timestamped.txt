[2:26] to revelations chapter 1 Revelation
[2:29] chapter 1 I'm gonna start at verse 1
[2:32] amen
[2:35] the Bible says the revelation of Jesus
[2:39] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[2:44] unto his servants things which must
[2:47] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[2:51] signified it by his angel unto his
[2:54] servant John who bare record of the word
[2:58] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[3:01] Christ and of all things that he saw
[3:05] blessed is he that readeth not just
[3:09] readeth and they that hear the words of
[3:12] his this prophecy and keep those things
[3:14] which are written therein for the time
[3:16] is at hand verse 4 John to the seven
[3:20] churches where which are in Asia grace
[3:23] be unto you and peace from him which is
[3:26] and which was and which is to come and
[3:31] from the seven spirits which are before
[3:34] his throne and from Jesus Christ who is
[3:39] the faithful witness and the first
[3:41] begotten of the Dead amen
[3:45] and the Prince of the kings of the earth
[3:48] you know it's interesting that it calls
[3:51] him the Prince of the kings of the earth
[3:54] you might think a prince it might be
[3:56] lower than the king but it's actually
[3:59] the other way around the prince is
[4:00] actually higher than a king the position
[4:02] if you look at the at the definition of
[4:04] this of this of the way it's saying it
[4:07] here it means a ruler Kings here on
[4:10] earth only rule for a certain period
[4:12] time amen this is the ruler of heaven
[4:15] and earth praise God unto him that loved
[4:18] us and washed us from our sins in his
[4:20] own blood and verse 6 and hath made us
[4:24] kings and priests unto God and his

[5:52] amen
[5:55] before I get started I would just ask
[6:00] that you all remember us in prayer 30
[6:04] days from now we're going to be leaving
[6:05] for Honduras and Nicaragua on December
[6:09] 14th so and I know I haven't mentioned
[6:14] that we haven't mentioned it much but so

[6:21] three almost three and a half weeks and
[6:23] they've we've got they've got a full
[6:27] schedule lined up for me down there

[6:32] convention and and preaching at a youth
[6:34] camp two youth camps and and dedicating
[6:39] a church the church that we've been
[6:40] helping helping out and and among other
[6:45] things probably preaching in other
[6:46] churches as well so it's gonna be packed
[6:49] out so you remember us in prayer my wife
[6:53] and my two daughters they're gonna come
[6:54] with me and so we're just gonna we're
[6:58] just expecting the Lord do great things
[6:59] amen and I was just asking I would ask
[7:04] and maybe this is something that I would
[7:06] maybe mention to brother Dale but there
[7:09] is a church down in Nicaragua that is
[7:11] trying to finish building a built their
[7:15] church down there and I told them that
[7:18] I've mentioned it to the church you know
[7:20] if you all wanted to help in any way you
[7:24] know with the church that would
[7:27] certainly bless them you're certainly
[7:29] not required to but but I told them that
[7:32] I'd mention it but if not you know you
[7:34] remember them in your prayers amen I'd
[7:36] sure the the believers they're there
[7:38] they've been very good to me in that
[7:40] part of Nicaragua and so there's they're
[7:44] trying to get finish up the building
[7:46] that they're there in the city of
[7:48] Managua which is the capital of
[7:50] Nicaragua so you remember that in prayer
[7:52] and you know whenever you're in missions
[7:57] you're always in the will of the Lord
[7:58] amen
[7:59] it's what brother Branham said so we're
[8:02] just there want to be a blessing so you
[8:03] remember us in prayer in the next
[8:05] several weeks is where as we're planning
[8:07] and
[8:07] getting ready to head out amen mmm
[8:10] praise the Lord Amen so you love the
[8:14] Lord Amen sister June brother Josh the
[8:20] Anna is good to see you guys back he may
[8:22] have missed you all it's always always
[8:26] missing sister June smiling face I said
[8:30] brother Josh no I can't say you smile
[8:36] sometimes there you go praise the Lord
[8:40] Amen well tonight I want to speak this
[8:44] evening and we're gonna try not to take
[8:46] up too much of your time
[8:47] amen but I want to if I could give it
[8:52] this a title I want to call it the
[8:54] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[8:57] gave unto you I know the Bible says the
[9:00] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[9:02] gave unto him now you got to make the
[9:04] word personal amen the revelation of
[9:07] Jesus Christ which God gave unto you
[9:10] amen because remember you are him amen
[9:14] he's you just as much if you got God
[9:18] dwelling in your soul amen there's God
[9:19] in but in the form of the Holy Spirit
[9:22] that's God's soul dwelling in you amen
[9:24] that makes you just as much God as he is
[9:26] amen and that's the thing that you and I
[9:29] have to confess in this hour it's so
[9:32] difficult for us so sure it was good
[9:34] yeah we can say it God was in in the
[9:37] disciples and we could say God was in
[9:40] the New Testament church God was in
[9:42] Paul's shirt
[9:43] God was in brother Branham but I don't
[9:45] know if God can be in me amen
[9:48] but the Bible wants you to confess that
[9:51] he is not only going to be with you but
[9:54] in you amen
[9:56] God's gonna have a voice in this hour
[9:59] amen God's gonna have a bride in this
[10:02] hour made up a multi-member bride amen
[10:05] that God is going to be manifesting in
[10:08] this day because remember God is
[10:10] supposed to be manifesting through all
[10:12] church ages and and we're still living
[10:15] in this age Amen I believe if you are
[10:18] born again amen
[10:20] baptizing
[10:21] in the Holy Spirit amen you're outside
[10:24] of the age your soul is right but we're
[10:26] still living here in Laodicea praise God
[10:28] and you are supposed to manifest God to
[10:31] this generation in this hour Amen God as
[10:35] I've said before God's gonna have a
[10:37] young person in the older person Amen a
[10:41] little kid Amen to manifest Jesus Christ
[10:45] in their day praise God I believe that
[10:49] without my heart amen and you you should
[10:52] be privileged and you should be honored
[10:54] and always wanted to give God that the
[10:58] praise they meant because he's chosen
[11:00] you in this hour to manifest the God of
[11:04] creation think about that Saints to
[11:07] manifest the God of creation who not
[11:09] just created the heavens and the earth
[11:11] created you and everything that you've
[11:15] made that you're made up of amen
[11:17] praise God and yet he wants to dwell in
[11:21] these little feeble vessels to reveal
[11:25] himself through us so that we can
[11:28] manifest him in this hour what a great
[11:31] privilege a man praise God
[11:33] amen so I'm gonna start reading with
[11:36] this quote amen with brother Branham end
[11:40] and if brothers the brothers could bring
[11:43] up quote number one amen praise the Lord
[11:51] welcome brother Branham says here he
[11:52] says in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[11:54] he says a notice it is also it also is
[11:59] the consummation of the scriptures the
[12:01] complete consummation speaking of
[12:03] speaking of of the of the scriptures the
[12:06] revelation and this let's get down to
[12:11] right here and when a man tries to take
[12:13] anything away from it or add anything to
[12:15] it God said he'd take the same part out
[12:19] of the book of life see he would take
[12:21] his part from the book if he added to it
[12:23] why is that because the revelation of
[12:26] Jesus Christ is the complete revelation
[12:28] of Jesus Christ that's the reason why
[12:30] you can't add nothing to it and you
[12:33] take nothing from it right because it's
[12:36] complete and if you try to add something
[12:39] to it
[12:40] then brother Bram said it's a false
[12:42] prophecy if you try to take something to
[12:44] it you're a thief amen
[12:46] and it's a fault you're false prophet as
[12:48] well therefore when we see the manifold
[12:50] revelation of our Lord who he is what he
[12:52] is if any person shall add something to
[12:55] that or take anything away from it it's
[12:57] a false prophecy many have tried to say
[13:00] they had something later than that but
[13:02] that is the complete revelation of the
[13:04] Lord Jesus in his church age in his day
[13:08] a revelation of our Lord amen
[13:12] praise the Lord amen and the next quote
[13:17] the brothers could bring it up early
[13:21] Brown says the importance of Revelation
[13:23] by the spirit to a true believer can
[13:26] never be overemphasized amen revelation
[13:32] means more to you than perhaps you
[13:34] realize because Saints you can listen to
[13:39] the Bible when I was in the Baptist
[13:41] Church I heard the word I heard Matthew
[13:44] 28:19 many times go ye into all the
[13:48] world baptized and name of the Father
[13:49] Son and Holy Ghost I read the scriptures
[13:52] I read all that word but if it's not rid
[13:56] of revelation to you amen
[14:00] then you don't know where you're
[14:01] standing you know when you know that
[14:04] something has come down and it's been
[14:07] revealed to you and you know for a fact
[14:09] nobody or no no movement no nothing no
[14:13] devil in Hell will ever shake that away
[14:15] from you that's the reason why when I
[14:18] came to the revelation when I came into
[14:20] this message in 1999 and and I heard the
[14:24] message and the first thing that that
[14:27] God that God revealed to me was one God
[14:30] and baptism name of Lord Jesus Christ
[14:33] and that sucked down to in me I mean I
[14:36] have understood anything else but that
[14:37] sunk down so deep in me that I I don't
[14:42] see how I can go back to what what I was
[14:45] used to believe
[14:46] there's just no way that's why I don't
[14:50] understand why these people that have
[14:51] been in the message 40 50 years and say
[14:54] and back in the nominal Church to get
[14:58] what it's did that means that their
[15:01] verbal ation they were the word was not
[15:04] revealed to them remember a revelation
[15:07] is a stone is a rock right let's just
[15:11] pretend it's bits there's a there's a
[15:14] big mountain in in in South Carolina or
[15:17] well there's a there's an area
[15:19] it's called Table Rock I don't know if
[15:21] you ever been to it or not
[15:22] there's a big rock there hanging off
[15:25] that mountain it's huge now it's gonna
[15:29] take our lot is gonna take a
[15:31] supernatural force to move that but
[15:34] there's nobody you can go over there and
[15:36] try to move Table Rock mm-hmm you know
[15:39] and have a bunch of people's trying to
[15:42] move it and it'll never budge because
[15:45] it's solid right and that's the same
[15:48] thing with a revelation when God reveals
[15:50] something from the Bible to you and you
[15:53] know for a fact God that is the truth
[15:55] there's nothing nobody no movement no
[15:58] nothing will shake that away from you
[16:00] amen and that's how it is with like the
[16:02] revelation with one God amen there's
[16:04] nobody can shake that away from you
[16:06] praise the Lord and Rosa well I see so
[16:11] revelation means more to you than
[16:13] perhaps you realize now I am NOT talking
[16:15] about this book of Revelation and you I
[16:18] am talking about all revelation it is
[16:22] tremendously important to the church so
[16:25] young people when when you hear the word
[16:27] would constantly say though the word
[16:28] revelation revelation revelation the
[16:32] Book of Revelations that's very
[16:35] important because without a revelation
[16:38] you don't know where you're standing
[16:41] without a revelation you're gonna be
[16:44] like a leaf will swayed to and fro one
[16:48] church says this then another church
[16:50] says this will I go to that then and
[16:52] then this church oh okay well I'll just
[16:54] go over here and then this church says
[16:58] that oh I'm just gonna go over here you
[16:59] know
[17:00] it's like that zombie message that I
[17:02] preached a couple of years ago you know
[17:04] you're like a zombie you know and then
[17:11] back and forth back and forth you see
[17:13] that that's how it is you're dead while
[17:16] you're living but when you have a true
[17:18] revelation of Jesus Christ you know
[17:20] where you're standing amen praise God
[17:22] you're alive because Christ is alive
[17:23] amen
[17:24] they scroll down to the bottom brothers
[17:27] and it says brother Brown says here the
[17:30] church is built on Revelation amen on
[17:35] the dust set the Lord praise God amen
[17:39] that's the reason why Jesus Christ Jesus
[17:41] said Jesus said on this rock I will
[17:46] build my church on who Jesus Christ this
[17:48] amen on the Son of God amen
[17:52] praise God and the gates of hell you see
[17:55] not even the gates of hell Satan himself
[17:58] cannot take that away from you when you
[18:02] truly when that revelation has sunk down
[18:04] deep into your heart amen
[18:06] why because he agrees with the word amen
[18:09] now if you go to number three brothers
[18:13] now this is what the this is what the
[18:16] the word revelation is is the word
[18:19] apocalypsis it sounds like in in Spanish
[18:23] it's apocalypsis so but that's the Greek
[18:27] and this is it means revelation be
[18:29] revealed to lighten manifestation are
[18:32] coming and appearing a laying bare
[18:34] making naked a disclosure of truth
[18:40] instruction concerning things before
[18:43] unknown you see used up events by which
[18:48] things are States or persons hitherto
[18:50] withdrawn from view are made visible to
[18:52] all manifestation and appearance amen so
[18:57] that's what a revelation is to you they
[18:59] meant you those that know about when
[19:03] Michelangelo made and brother Branham
[19:05] preached the message this message when
[19:07] Michelangelo made the statue of Moses
[19:09] you see and it had to add when he was
[19:12] complete when he was done
[19:14] sure maybe he had the thing covered for
[19:17] the critics to come through and see what
[19:20] this statue was all about and once that
[19:23] cover came off then the critics were
[19:26] able to see exactly what was under that
[19:28] that cover you see and that's what a
[19:31] revelation is when something's revealed
[19:33] to you then you can see it clearly it's
[19:35] not you're not guessing anymore
[19:37] you're not pondering whether it is this
[19:40] is that way or this that way no when
[19:43] it's revealed to you you see it clearly
[19:46] amen and guess what word Beals on top of
[19:50] that revelation more revelation on top
[19:53] of that revelation because even the
[19:55] critics probably looking at that statue
[19:57] of Michael of Moses they probably they
[20:01] got closer to it then and they started
[20:03] seeing oh my look at this the court look
[20:06] at this this knee right here and look at
[20:08] look at the ears look at that beard how
[20:10] its shaped you know getting all into the
[20:12] details and that's how it is when the
[20:15] true revelation of Christ is come into
[20:16] your life it's not gonna be just one
[20:19] revelation its revelation on top of
[20:21] Revelation on top of Revelation that's
[20:24] building the Sun in you amen the Son of
[20:27] God in you Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[20:30] amen all right so so even so even Jesus
[20:38] he had to grow in Revelation and you
[20:42] might like what Jesus himself had to
[20:46] grow in Revelation the Bible says that
[20:49] he had to grow in wisdom and in
[20:52] knowledge amen praise God even though he
[20:57] was born God he was born God right here
[21:02] on earth
[21:02] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[21:04] dwelleth in him he didn't know all
[21:07] things he still had to grow amen
[21:12] praise God some of you are looking a
[21:15] little bit low looking at me a little
[21:17] strange but I'll just let I'll just let
[21:19] brother branham tell you that in just a
[21:22] minute let's just read a few scriptures
[21:24] and
[21:25] and look what John 5:19 says then
[21:29] answered Jesus and said unto them verily
[21:31] verily I say unto you the son can do
[21:34] nothing of himself so Jesus couldn't
[21:38] just go and do whatever he wanted to but
[21:42] why he seeth the father do for what
[21:46] things soever he doeth these also doeth
[21:48] the son likewise it's he only was able
[21:51] to do what the what God what the father
[21:54] revealed to him to do that's why he
[21:57] could do why because he was our example
[22:03] see he came in the flesh he was just as
[22:05] much God as he was human you see but he
[22:09] was our example amen
[22:11] because he also had some limit as a
[22:14] limit to him as well because we can't we
[22:17] should we can't act unless God reveals
[22:20] or it shows us what we need to do next
[22:23] you see praise God I like I like how
[22:27] brother Dale you know when he talks
[22:29] about how he would study this Daniel
[22:31] seventy weeks and and things like that
[22:33] and he said I would not preach Daniel
[22:34] seventy weeks or some doctrines that he
[22:37] couldn't fully understand until he fully
[22:40] understood him then you see until that
[22:42] came down and Rabindra it was revealed
[22:44] to him and I like that you see I like I
[22:47] think a minister should do that you know
[22:49] because you might cause more harm than
[22:50] you do good you see amen
[22:53] there's something you don't understand
[22:54] just leave it alone amen maybe calling
[22:57] somebody else that might be able to help
[22:59] you amen
[23:01] but just leave it alone and let God
[23:02] reveal that to you John 15:15 says
[23:06] henceforth I call you not servants for
[23:08] the servant knoweth not what his Lord do
[23:10] it but I have called you friends for all
[23:13] things that I have heard of my father I
[23:17] have made known unto you amen
[23:19] so that was his that was his desire he
[23:22] wanted to make all things know unto them
[23:25] and speaking of speaking unto the
[23:27] disciples and he wanted us amen to he
[23:30] wanted all things to be made known unto
[23:32] them but he can only make known unto
[23:34] them what the father gave him
[23:36] Matthew 11:27 says all things are
[23:39] delivered unto me of my father
[23:40] and no man knoweth the Sun but the
[23:43] father neither knoweth any man the
[23:44] father saved the Sun and he to
[23:47] whomsoever the Sun will reveal him amen
[23:51] praise God aren't you glad that you're
[23:53] part of that whomsoever at whomsoever
[23:57] capture lates all of us if you have the
[23:59] Holy Spirit in your life amen praise God
[24:02] amen so let me just let the Prophet tell
[24:05] you if it go to rob Ram says here he
[24:12] says now I said that this book of
[24:13] Revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[24:16] and what he is doing in the churches for
[24:19] those seven ages it is a revelation
[24:21] because the disciples themselves didn't
[24:24] know these recorded truths it had not
[24:27] been previously revealed to them you
[24:30] remember that they came to Jesus in the
[24:32] book of Acts and asked him are you at
[24:33] this time going to restore the kingdom
[24:35] to Israel and he said it is not for you
[24:38] to know the times or the seasons those
[24:42] men were still thinking of Jesus having
[24:45] an earthly Kingdom but it was a
[24:48] spiritual Kingdom that he was going to
[24:50] build now look what brother Brown says
[24:53] here even he could not tell them about
[24:56] his place in it for the father had not
[25:00] revealed it unto him but now after his
[25:07] death and resurrection watch now
[25:11] after his death and resurrection and at
[25:14] this particular time in his Metis
[25:17] mediatorial ministry he is able to set
[25:21] forth here in this revelation of himself
[25:24] to John what his glory and presence in
[25:28] the church would mean and do praise God
[25:32] so Jesus himself did not do why because
[25:35] listen he had to fulfill he had to die
[25:39] and he had to resurrect he had to become
[25:44] the firstfruits of the Resurrection he
[25:47] had to become the firstfruits
[25:49] all this though the things that took
[25:51] place in his life so that you so that he
[25:54] could pass that down unto us Amen by via
[25:57] the Holy Spirit amen and then we be
[26:00] partakers of that same life you see
[26:03] that's the reason why we can partake
[26:05] Amen we can we are looking forward to a
[26:08] resurrection in this hour because he
[26:11] resurrected the resident the people the
[26:16] the Saints that have died before us are
[26:18] not going to raise if Jesus Christ have
[26:20] not raised see God had to do it first
[26:23] then we which are alive and remain then
[26:26] we in this hour can perform amen the
[26:31] same things in this hour but without him
[26:34] we can do nothing the Bible says you see
[26:37] I'm so thankful a man that he that he
[26:41] had to do it amen himself first so when
[26:45] Jesus died and raised amen
[26:50] he said after that he said that all
[26:53] power was given unto him both in heaven
[26:57] and in earth right isn't that what he
[26:59] said it was at that time that he said
[27:02] that before that he didn't say that even
[27:07] though he had God dwelling in him you
[27:09] think about that Saints the fullness of
[27:11] the Godhead bodily dwelleth in him
[27:13] potentially Jesus Christ had all power
[27:17] in both in heaven and earth amen
[27:20] but it wasn't until the resurrection
[27:23] after he died and after he resurrected
[27:26] that he said all power is given unto me
[27:29] both in heaven and in earth
[27:32] amen praise God and you think about this
[27:35] Saints if Jesus Christ could do a man
[27:38] what he did with the fullness of the
[27:40] Godhead bodily dwelleth in him amen and
[27:44] the things that you at this multi member
[27:46] brought a body amen can do in this hour
[27:49] with just the downpayment of God in
[27:51] their life in down in your soul they
[27:53] meant
[27:56] God wants you to believe his word and he
[27:58] wants to perform it through you amen
[28:01] even though you have a my new portion of
[28:05] God dwelling in you but the thing is is
[28:08] that that little minut portion has just
[28:11] as much God as Dez Dez Dez the whole
[28:14] thing you have to see it that way amen
[28:18] now we are waiting for a full
[28:21] manifestation because while we were
[28:23] waiting for the redemption of these
[28:24] bodies amen
[28:25] we're still waiting for the redemption
[28:27] of this body so so that little my new
[28:30] portion is gonna lead to that fullness
[28:33] with that full portion amen you just
[28:36] keep hanging on Saints keep hanging on
[28:38] in this hour there's not time to give up
[28:41] it's not time to to to to throw in the
[28:45] towel and say when is the lord jesus
[28:47] coming huh huh
[28:48] you know or delaying his coming you know
[28:53] you may not be saying oh I hope I hope
[28:55] the Lord comes later I hope I hope he
[28:57] comes later you know how you say that by
[29:00] the things you do the things you do and
[29:04] the things that you engage in really
[29:06] show what you think about the coming of
[29:09] the Lord if you're just fully just all
[29:12] you're thinking about is this life and
[29:14] about and about what I'm gonna you know
[29:17] things of this and you're just fully
[29:21] given into this and less to this word it
[29:23] shows where you're really where your
[29:26] heart is because Jesus Christ said where
[29:28] your heart is there were your treasure
[29:30] be awesome or where your treasure is
[29:32] there will your heart be also
[29:34] you see you may not be saying it Lord
[29:37] just wait until wait until I get married
[29:39] and then then you can come no it's just
[29:43] your actions will show that you you
[29:46] don't want the little coming of the Lord
[29:47] you don't want this word you want the
[29:50] earthly fleshly things of this life amen
[29:54] I hope that's not the case
[29:55] praise God amen praise the Lord Saints
[30:00] now so the be like brother Bob amen
[30:06] I need some water
[30:08] I think brother Bob did a wonderful job
[30:12] on Sunday amen I think he did he did
[30:15] good
[30:16] praise the Lord really enjoyed the word
[30:20] amen
[30:22] so Saints the all this inheritance God
[30:28] has given to us already you see my
[30:31] question is so what I was getting to was
[30:34] if Jesus Christ was given all power both
[30:38] in heaven and earth and he said that it
[30:40] was right then why is it that you and I
[30:46] are not manifesting this power in our
[30:48] life think about it he has he has
[30:53] everything under subjection right both
[30:57] in heaven and earth he said that he did
[30:58] then why are his children not
[31:02] manifesting that same power in this hour
[31:05] if we're to his children if we're born
[31:09] of his bone flesh of his flesh life of
[31:12] his life amen
[31:13] why now you think about it on this line
[31:17] remember when the children of Israel
[31:19] when they were walking in the wilderness
[31:20] leaving Egypt God said that I will I'm
[31:23] giving you a land that's flowing with
[31:26] milk and honey and they were not even at
[31:30] that land yet yet God had told them I've
[31:33] given it to you it's theirs right it's
[31:37] theirs but they needed to go and possess
[31:41] it right so you see the promises of God
[31:44] is for you and I there are ours this
[31:47] whole the redemption of a body the the
[31:49] the the raising of the Saints amen all
[31:53] these things are for us God has given us
[31:56] all these things but we need to come to
[31:59] a place amen
[32:00] where we possess those things amen you
[32:05] see it wasn't like when you read in
[32:06] Joshua chapter 1 Amen when they crossed
[32:08] over to the to the to the promised land
[32:11] it was until the crossing that they
[32:14] actually took possession right but they
[32:16] need it they needed to stick with the
[32:19] Word of God that God had already told
[32:20] them to
[32:21] amen the Word of God had already said
[32:24] I've given you this land I've given you
[32:27] this land then Moses went off the scene
[32:29] and Joshua Amen then took over and they
[32:32] needed to continue / moving on to the to
[32:37] the promised land it wasn't until they
[32:40] crossed over to the promised land that
[32:42] they fully took possession of that
[32:44] promise right but what what what kept
[32:48] them for them to continue moving under
[32:50] they had to hold on to that word that
[32:52] was given to them you see and you and I
[32:54] Saints we have to continue holding on to
[32:57] this word that was given unto us amen
[33:00] this word of God the Word of God amen
[33:03] the promises of God and the message of
[33:05] the hour continue to hold on to these
[33:07] things don't get tired don't get weary
[33:10] amen
[33:10] and one day these things will come out
[33:12] in its fullness out of you
[33:15] amen then the fullness of the revelation
[33:17] of Jesus Christ will be manifested
[33:20] through you amen
[33:21] then you can fully say the the
[33:23] revelation of Jesus Christ that was
[33:25] given unto me amen
[33:29] not just to Jesus if you are part of him
[33:33] a man it was given unto you - amen
[33:38] but it needs it you need to continue it
[33:41] is it's a multi-layered revelation don't
[33:44] get sleepy on me please
[33:47] amen it's a multi-layered revelation
[33:52] amen praise God now let's read let's
[33:57] read quote 6 amen
[33:58] I'm getting to something so I appreciate
[34:00] your patience now the same thing is this
[34:07] if you are a son of God and if I and if
[34:09] I am a son of God or a daughter of God
[34:12] we were in God at the beginning but we
[34:17] were not there rolling around and
[34:18] jumping and shouting and nothing like
[34:19] that like you you think when you hear
[34:22] that when you first come into the
[34:23] message we say they say oh we were in
[34:25] God you know and you think I was there
[34:27] shouting and jumping and stuff like that
[34:29] really but brother Branham said that you
[34:33] didn't even you
[34:34] even exist they there was no existence
[34:36] of you only in his mind because you were
[34:39] an attribute of him you were not little
[34:41] like brother Dell says you were not
[34:42] little specks inside inside God's body
[34:44] amen
[34:46] and and look what brother Bram says here
[34:48] and when Jesus became the fullness of
[34:51] the word I thought he was the fullness
[34:52] of the word already
[34:55] and when Jesus became the fullness of
[34:59] the word then we were in him germ form
[35:03] ah when he remember he said that all
[35:08] power heaven and earth was given unto me
[35:11] when after the resurrection right now
[35:16] brother Bram said but we'll just let him
[35:18] sit when he was crucified we was
[35:20] crucified in his body why why were we
[35:24] crucified in his body what does that
[35:27] mean because the we were part of that
[35:30] eternal life that he had right we were
[35:34] part we were in him amen when he arose
[35:37] from the dead we rose with him that
[35:39] eternal life was still working there and
[35:42] now since we have recognized that now we
[35:46] set together with him in heavenly places
[35:49] in Christ Jesus praise God
[35:53] see for he we if we are sons and
[35:56] daughters of God we are God's children
[35:58] then we are attributes of God then we
[36:01] were got eternal life after you've
[36:04] recognized after your new birth amen and
[36:07] God is the only eternal life there is
[36:11] then we were in him from the beginning
[36:15] when you have eternal life amen
[36:18] at the new birth amen that's when you
[36:22] have eternal life praise God we didn't
[36:25] come here with eternal life yeah well
[36:29] let brother branham say that here and a
[36:31] following and following quote he says
[36:33] and God is the only ternal life there is
[36:36] then we were in him from the beginning
[36:38] and when Jesus became all that word
[36:42] again I thought he was all the word when
[36:44] he was here on earth no he had to grow
[36:46] as well just like you and I have to grow
[36:50] amen
[36:51] in the fullness of the word then we were
[36:55] a part of him then amen
[36:57] there you are when that's in there there
[36:59] is no devil no powers no nothing can
[37:02] ever move it that's the type post of the
[37:04] soul that is the revelation of Jesus
[37:07] Christ amen
[37:09] because why the the gates of Hell cannot
[37:12] prevail against that that's why he says
[37:14] here no devil no powers know nothing can
[37:16] never move it when you have the full
[37:18] revelation of Jesus Christ dwelling in
[37:20] you amen scroll it scroll down brothers
[37:24] now watch what he says here that lady
[37:26] was seeing church eggs naked blind
[37:27] miserable don't even know it see it's
[37:29] out it's that anointed anointed with the
[37:31] real spirit see that Holy Spirit can
[37:33] fall upon a man in his spirit but his
[37:35] soul is his germ that germ is the word
[37:41] amen that germ is the word it's not a
[37:48] literal germ is his word amen when his
[37:53] word is in you amen
[37:55] then you can have eternal life amen you
[37:58] have to hear the word first right you
[38:01] have to hear the word first then God can
[38:03] quicken that word amen and bring you and
[38:06] give you the new birth praise God amen
[38:08] so now let's let's let's move down to
[38:13] amen the tabernacle of Moses amen
[38:17] I love the tabernacle of Moses because
[38:20] it has its it just typifies Christ in so
[38:22] many aspects I mean it it speaks of
[38:24] Christ now in the real tabernacle this
[38:31] is this was shown this way because
[38:35] really all these layers that it has it's
[38:39] fully it's it's actually was actually
[38:41] covering the whole tabernacle you see so
[38:44] they only that the person that drew this
[38:46] drew it this way so that you can see
[38:48] under those layers right but you think
[38:51] about this saints this layer right here
[38:55] this look this is a badger skin layer
[38:58] the Bible says that on the outside of it
[39:01] that bet that it was going to be a layer
[39:04] or a covering of badger skins now to me
[39:08] I don't know about you but I think
[39:10] that's ugly
[39:11] I don't know about you but I think
[39:14] that's ugly I mean to me if it was me if
[39:17] I was making the tabernacle I would put
[39:19] the be most beautiful one on the outside
[39:22] right because I want to be I want people
[39:28] to say hey that looks sharp you know it
[39:31] looks good
[39:31] that's a nice Tabernacle you got there
[39:33] [Music]
[39:36] but God told Moses in the making if you
[39:39] read this in the book of Exodus I
[39:41] believe it is how he wanted this to be
[39:44] made he wanted on the outside as that
[39:47] tabernacle was going for it to be made
[39:49] out of badgers camp badger is an animal
[39:52] right a bunch of fur doesn't look pretty
[39:55] maybe if you like fur coats maybe that
[39:58] might look nice to you but that's ugly
[40:01] but that's how God amen but the people
[40:05] didn't understand that within that
[40:06] tabernacle dwelleth all the fullness of
[40:08] God dwelleth though the dwelleth God was
[40:12] dwelling in that tabernacle you see but
[40:15] on the outside it then looked like it on
[40:17] the outside it looked like a what in the
[40:21] world is that and then in the middle of
[40:23] walking in the desert and all these
[40:25] things my goodness what did people think
[40:27] about about seeing something like this
[40:29] you see and you and I Saints are living
[40:31] in this world walking in the middle of
[40:33] this desert and some of us are just as
[40:37] ugly as ugly can be I include myself in
[40:43] there where we're not we're not people
[40:48] you know that that the world we're not
[40:49] Hollywood stars we don't we're not shiny
[40:53] we're not we're not you know the
[40:55] beautiful people that people think oh my
[40:57] goodness muscles and all kinds of stuff
[41:00] we're not you know we're not that way
[41:02] but people don't understand that even
[41:05] though we don't look that way a man God
[41:06] still dwells in you full fully
[41:09] amen and he's pleased to dwell in you he
[41:13] wasn't just pleased to dwell in Jesus
[41:15] Christ he's pleased to dwell in you you
[41:20] who has made a badger skin he's pleased
[41:25] to dwell on you sister Susan I won't say
[41:30] anymore amen praise God amen so in in in
[41:39] saying this this is you see when
[41:43] somebody would go under here they would
[41:44] go under to the tabernacle and they'd go
[41:46] in and they'd see all these different
[41:48] layers let's say that maybe they were
[41:50] coming from the back end of the
[41:51] tabernacle they would pull up one layer
[41:54] okay I got through the the Badger skin
[41:57] oh wow
[41:58] this is so nice now this is a beautiful
[42:02] red tapestry type type of you know this
[42:06] is beautiful I could wrap myself with
[42:08] this you know and just but then all of a
[42:11] sudden they've realized that there's
[42:12] another layer under that layer they
[42:14] thought that layer was good but then
[42:16] they realized there's another layer
[42:17] under that and then they find out and
[42:21] they say oh my that's wonderful this is
[42:23] good this is oh this is awesome
[42:26] and then they realized there's another
[42:27] layer under that and it just seems to
[42:30] get better and better and better each
[42:32] layer that they go you see it's like an
[42:35] onion peel like where the way talks
[42:36] about pulling out the different layers
[42:39] the different layers amen until it
[42:41] finally you go in and you realize that's
[42:45] God in there amen
[42:46] but you have to go through all the
[42:49] layers you see and this is like the
[42:50] revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:52] multi-layered in in you and I you don't
[42:55] dump everything all at once God God
[42:58] knows that not to dump everything all at
[43:00] once in you because you won't be able to
[43:02] handle it you you parents who have
[43:06] children you can't dump every not
[43:08] everything that you've learned through
[43:10] your the years that you've grown up all
[43:13] in your children just like that
[43:15] no you can because you vote you would
[43:19] overwhelm them
[43:20] you would frustrate them you would
[43:22] overwhelmed them and saying thank God
[43:24] with us you see I can't give the example
[43:27] is always given but I can't give Zoe my
[43:31] car keys because she has no idea how to
[43:34] drive
[43:35] yesterday she just learned how to turn
[43:37] on the wipers because I showed her
[43:40] that's all she's gonna do for now I
[43:43] would not expect for me to give her my
[43:46] keys and say here Zoe can you drop Bella
[43:49] to school please she wouldn't have won I
[43:53] clue about how that car turns now she
[43:57] might because someone she's smarter than
[43:59] you think but she's very observant but I
[44:04] wouldn't trust her with my keys same
[44:06] thing with God with us there are certain
[44:09] times when he knows you got you can
[44:11] handle this revelation and then there's
[44:13] all right he's taking he and she has
[44:16] been able to come to this they they've
[44:19] exercised this and there's fullness now
[44:21] can pour a little bit more in there amen
[44:23] until it's revealing Christ amen little
[44:26] by little that's why the statue of the
[44:28] perfect man is the way it is faith
[44:31] virtue knowledge all that is revelation
[44:33] each virtue is a revelation to you amen
[44:37] and it's not a revelation that you get
[44:39] from your own it's something that the
[44:41] Holy Spirit has to produce in your life
[44:44] amen the Holy Spirit is the one who
[44:46] gives you holy faith holy virtue holy
[44:49] knowledge temperance and patience got
[44:51] all these things you don't have it in
[44:53] you

[47:25] you get the headstone you get Christ you
[47:29] get the headstone amen and you get the
[47:34] full word of God amen now that's not
[47:37] that's not for you I'm taking all these
[47:39] back yeah it don't spend it all in one
[47:44] place
[47:46] Thank You Olivia amen praise God I hope
[47:57] you get my point
[47:58] amen you have to go through through you
[48:04] have to go through faith virtue
[48:06] knowledge patience amen
[48:09] but that revelation those layers keep
[48:12] getting better and better each time see
[48:16] Olivia has she had to stay with it right
[48:19] then she was able to get amen amen the
[48:24] full word amen now it's all dwelling in
[48:27] you already right but why are we still
[48:32] here 50 years after the seals have been
[48:34] open I thought they were open it's
[48:37] because you and me have not caught the
[48:39] full revelation of this of this word you
[48:42] and me I have not amen somebody's gonna
[48:45] catch this because somebody's gonna call
[48:47] the dead from the ground the Saints
[48:49] they're waiting on for you and me in
[48:51] this hour praise the Lord amen so watch
[48:56] what brother Branham says here so what
[48:58] is the revelation of Jesus Christ if the
[49:01] brothers could bring up number seven
[49:03] says so the Bible is the complete
[49:06] revelation of Jesus Christ amen and it
[49:10] was wrote by prophets hebrews 1:1 and
[49:12] God who in sundry times spake to the
[49:14] father's by the prophets in this last
[49:17] day speaks to us through His Son Jesus
[49:19] Christ which was the prophets all of
[49:23] them put together let me ask you this
[49:24] who is God speaking through in this hour
[49:29] is it a different person than Jesus
[49:32] Christ
[49:33] no it's still Jesus Christ but Jesus
[49:38] Christ in you and me amen
[49:40] because the world is you and I are the
[49:43] only Jesus Christ that this world will
[49:45] ever see and there's God's Jesus Christ
[49:48] still speaking through you and me amen
[49:50] Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah
[49:54] Isaiah Elijah all that they were were in
[49:57] him and all that you are and all I am
[50:02] brother branham speaking of himself is
[50:03] in him look what he says his words
[50:08] witnesses of the word I like that
[50:11] amen that's why Paul said that you and I
[50:15] are written in pistils both red and all
[50:19] man what does that mean you and me are
[50:22] like written letters that somebody's
[50:24] reading letters that somebody is reading
[50:28] amen we're words amen
[50:31] being witnesses of the word amen which
[50:35] is Jesus Christ so it is not a book of
[50:37] systems a code of moral ethics neither
[50:40] is it a history book or a book of
[50:42] theology it's not the Bible it's not
[50:44] just a book of rules of dudes do's and
[50:46] don'ts that's not what God wanted it to
[50:48] be it's not a history book either
[50:51] although there is history in it amen
[50:54] but you and I are in their saints amen
[50:58] and the prophets were building the body
[51:00] of Christ as they would speak about
[51:02] Jesus Christ they were building the body
[51:05] of Christ amen
[51:07] until finally he came in his full and he
[51:10] came when he came here on earth that was
[51:13] the son of man praise God but it's a
[51:16] revelation of Jesus Christ God Himself
[51:19] revealed from word to flesh now listen
[51:23] to this
[51:24] pay attention to this because what is
[51:25] that revelation of Jesus Christ that's
[51:28] what it is the Bible is the word and God
[51:31] is the flesh God and God is the word
[51:35] rather in Jesus being the flesh that's
[51:38] what he meant
[51:39] it's the revelation how God the word
[51:43] was manifested in human flesh and
[51:45] revealed to us now that's what the
[51:48] revelation of Jesus Christ is is the
[51:51] revelation of how God the word revealed
[51:54] himself through flesh and it happened in
[51:58] the life of Jesus Christ he had to come
[52:01] and reveal and come in the in flesh
[52:04] because he had to make a way for a
[52:06] people for salvation for a people that
[52:08] was to come ahead of him later on in him
[52:13] being God he had without no sin without
[52:16] nobody could put a finger on his life he
[52:20] was the only one worthy to be able to
[52:22] die for us and make a way so that you
[52:25] and I so that he can have sinners saved
[52:29] by grace come and be just exactly like
[52:33] he is not in their own merit because you
[52:38] and me came in this earth speaking lies
[52:41] and and and and and and sinners and
[52:45] that's why we have to be saved by grace
[52:47] but you see he had to he did it first
[52:50] that's why he's the firstfruits Amen of
[52:53] all these things and paved the way so
[52:55] that he can have a multi-member body
[52:57] that there was gonna so that he can
[53:01] produce a resurrection through this
[53:03] bride and then also a change of
[53:05] glorification of the body amen he wasn't
[53:08] just gonna keep that just for himself he
[53:10] wanted to share that glory with you and
[53:12] I Saints amen praise the Lord and that's
[53:16] why he becomes a son of God he is part
[53:19] of God you understand brother Brown says
[53:22] amen praise God so as I was saying
[53:25] earlier Saints that's why you have to be
[53:27] rooted amen in the word Amen not be like
[53:31] a leaf brother but the Paul said don't
[53:34] be like a leaf tossed to and fro you see
[53:37] the being carried away with every wind
[53:40] of doctrine here comes some some
[53:44] visitors raise the Lord I'm glad they
[53:50] made it safe brother Dale and brother
[53:52] wait and breath Don amen so we can't be
[53:56] like a leaf
[53:56] carried away with all doctrines and all
[53:59] kinds of things I mean we have to know
[54:01] where we're standing young people we
[54:04] have to know you have to know you have
[54:06] to know God for yourself don't just
[54:10] depend but mom and dad you know my mom
[54:13] and dad they'll be able to help me out
[54:15] or reward know there's gonna come a
[54:17] point in time where your mom and dad is
[54:18] not gonna be there I'm sorry to say
[54:22] mommy and daddy are not always gonna be
[54:26] there well you know we're not promised
[54:29] we're not promised always to be living
[54:34] on this life some of us may lose our mom
[54:36] and dad before we've gotten a certain
[54:39] age some of us have that's already
[54:42] happened to us you see you're not
[54:44] promised that we pray for our mom and
[54:46] dad that's why you have to pray for your
[54:48] parents pray for them and you pray for
[54:51] your family and say Lord protect put a
[54:53] shield around them but it's a vist their
[54:55] time to go God's gonna take him and he's
[54:57] doing it for a reason and what are you
[54:59] gonna do then you can't you can't you
[55:01] you have to depend you have to depend on
[55:04] God amen and say Lord mom and dad took
[55:07] me this far and you have to lead me the
[55:09] rest of the way it's a dark world out
[55:12] there but lord I know that through I can
[55:15] make it through all this darkness amen
[55:17] god bless you stranger good to have you
[55:20] in the house of God good that brother
[55:23] done with us praise the Lord amen so
[55:28] let's read a sweet quote number eight
[55:34] how many love the Lord
[55:37] praise the Lord amen where the BAM says
[55:43] here then he was made actually human
[55:45] flesh and dwelled among us in the person
[55:48] of Jesus Christ himself born of the
[55:51] Virgin Mary he come in that form so he
[55:53] could die and went back into heaven now
[55:56] in this last days he has promised to
[55:59] manifest himself in the fullness again
[56:01] of his flesh in spirit now he says in
[56:04] this last days God has promised to
[56:07] reveal himself again or to full manifest
[56:10] themselves again amen praise God see for
[56:14] as it was in these days in the days of
[56:17] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[56:19] the Son of Man so do you believe a man
[56:22] that we're living in the days of Sodom
[56:24] I believe it's even worse than Sodom
[56:26] that's why brother Branham said that if
[56:28] God does not punish America for her sins
[56:34] amen he would have to pick Sodom and
[56:37] Gomorrah back up and apologize to them
[56:40] if he does not punish this country for
[56:43] their sins not just this country but the
[56:46] world around us in the in the anointing
[56:49] that it's under you see Satan is the god
[56:52] of this evil age so I think I believe
[56:55] it's worse than Sodom and Gomorrah now
[56:58] look at the Sodom how it's said and what
[57:00] taking place and Jesus Christ being
[57:02] manifested in bodily form of his church
[57:05] today see doing the same thing same work
[57:08] same things that he did all the time
[57:10] never changes the eternal one see and
[57:14] upon earth today he has manifested
[57:18] himself in the human bodies our human
[57:21] bodies he makes it personal
[57:24] oh well God killed surely God can won't
[57:27] do that to me look what I did yesterday
[57:29] if you repented of it you don't have to
[57:33] worry about that anymore it's all under
[57:35] the blood as a matter of fact he was
[57:37] under the blood when he died for you on
[57:38] the cross of Calvary praise God
[57:41] our human bodies that he has called and
[57:43] done exactly the same thing he'd done in
[57:45] sundried times and in the times of his
[57:47] flesh upon the earth
[57:49] and doing the same thing today because
[57:52] God and sundry times spoke to the
[57:54] fathers through the prophets in this
[57:57] last days through His Son Jesus Christ
[58:00] are you his son are you Jesus Christ
[58:07] amen
[58:08] he said he wants you to confess it why
[58:13] are we so afraid to confess who we
[58:15] really are you know and it's and it's at
[58:20] that time when when the bride starts
[58:22] becoming to say me and my father are one
[58:25] and you watch that's when persecutions
[58:28] really gonna start striking but if it's
[58:32] the truth they're not persecuting you
[58:34] they're persecuting God they're
[58:36] persecuting the truth see the son being
[58:39] revealed in the last days God manifested
[58:42] in human flesh setting just before
[58:44] Sodom's destruction the end of the
[58:46] Gentile world you see it there is three
[58:48] manifestations now the next thing
[58:52] happens is when it's all gathered up
[58:54] into that one person Jesus Christ bride
[58:57] and body at the physical return of the
[59:00] Lord Jesus making his three times when
[59:03] he was brought on earth killed crucified
[59:05] raised up manifesting his self in the
[59:07] form of his body which is his bride the
[59:11] woman amen that's the only Jesus Christ
[59:14] that the world's gonna see in this hour
[59:16] you get it she is part of his body I'm
[59:20] trying to go a little quicker here and
[59:22] the bride today is taken out from the
[59:25] body of Christ which is acting and doing
[59:28] just exactly like he said it would do
[59:31] for this day the bride the queen king
[59:34] and the queen all right
[59:36] amen praise the Lord Jesus amen God
[59:43] wants you to confess amen that you are
[59:45] him and that he is you amen jesus said
[59:52] when when he was here on earth when you
[59:53] seen me you've seen the father
[59:55] amen praise God and God wants you to say
[1:00:00] the same thing
[1:00:01] when you see me not-not-not i'm nothing
[1:00:03] with him with with my flesh and my my
[1:00:07] spirit now nothing but that soul that if
[1:00:10] god's soul is dwelling in you in the
[1:00:11] form of the holy spirit amen
[1:00:13] you're just as God as he is amen just as
[1:00:16] much God as he is praise God
[1:00:20] amen I want I want I wanna I want you to
[1:00:24] we're almost done but I want to talk
[1:00:26] about something here in the in in the
[1:00:28] book of Revelation now we read read here
[1:00:32] in revelation 1:1 it says the revelation
[1:00:33] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[1:00:37] right I say which God gave unto you a
[1:00:41] month but it's unto him right because
[1:00:44] you are him to show unto his servants
[1:00:47] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:00:48] and he sent and signified it by his
[1:00:51] angel unto his servant John Amen so the
[1:00:56] actual revelation or the this word has
[1:01:00] been with us for over you know for over
[1:01:03] 2000 for two thousand years the Bible
[1:01:06] has been written the revelation has been
[1:01:09] there the Book of Revelations has been
[1:01:11] there for a long long time and God and
[1:01:15] Jesus showed this to John showed these
[1:01:17] things to John yeah John even though he
[1:01:21] was showing these things to John John
[1:01:23] couldn't fully comprehend what was going
[1:01:26] on right now remember John is a type of
[1:01:30] the bride
[1:01:31] but the Brenham said that john is a type
[1:01:34] is a type of the bride so even at us
[1:01:38] seeing John they're seeing what God was
[1:01:42] showing him they're on the Isle of
[1:01:43] Patmos John might have thought that's
[1:01:46] that's amazing that's powerful that's
[1:01:48] wonderful but he still didn't get a
[1:01:51] revelation of what that was now I want
[1:01:55] you I want us to if the brothers in the
[1:01:56] back they could turn if they could go to
[1:01:58] revelations chapter 10 if they could
[1:02:00] bring up that Scripture
[1:02:01] Revelation chapter I don't have it in
[1:02:03] but they could bring up the the Bible
[1:02:05] revelations chapter 10
[1:02:09] because it's like us you see it's like
[1:02:11] the it's like the multi-layered the
[1:02:13] multi-layered rappers but Wade you
[1:02:16] missed today's what is but it's like the
[1:02:26] different layers you see that's sure
[1:02:28] this layer was wonderful
[1:02:31] right and in in in Olivia it probably
[1:02:35] surprised her when she saw that oh wow
[1:02:37] that's pretty cuz she said it she said
[1:02:39] that's pretty and then she got to the
[1:02:41] other one
[1:02:41] oh wow that's pretty but there was more
[1:02:44] oh that's pretty
[1:02:46] but there's more that's pretty but
[1:02:49] there's more you see right and so that's
[1:02:53] how it's like you and me you know we
[1:02:55] come into this message and we see one
[1:02:57] thing we see one wowthat's we see one
[1:03:00] god praise God
[1:03:01] and you feel like that's oh my you've
[1:03:03] gotten a hold of something you've gotten
[1:03:05] a hold of the whole world once you see
[1:03:06] one God revelation of one God and then
[1:03:10] you realize and you start looking more
[1:03:12] into the word and God starts showing you
[1:03:15] statue of a perfect man and starts
[1:03:18] showing you that uh corn the cornerstone
[1:03:21] amen the headstone became the
[1:03:23] cornerstone and all these things and
[1:03:26] Zerubbabel and all these different
[1:03:28] things you see it's Deb those rappers
[1:03:31] just coming unfolding unfolding
[1:03:33] unfolding amen
[1:03:35] and that's how it was with John and
[1:03:37] Mathers John was seeing all these things
[1:03:39] that you and my the you and I read in
[1:03:41] the book of Revelation and it was more
[1:03:44] real to him than it is to us go up I was
[1:03:46] just reading it but it was the
[1:03:48] revelation of Jesus Christ now look what
[1:03:50] it says here in Revelation chapter 10 it
[1:03:52] says and I saw another mighty angel come
[1:03:54] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:03:56] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:04:00] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[1:04:03] as pillars of fire who is that speaking
[1:04:04] of it's nothing but Jesus Christ amen
[1:04:08] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:04:11] open I want you to see that the book was
[1:04:14] open that little book was open it was
[1:04:17] not closed and it was not half open it
[1:04:20] was open
[1:04:22] fully open and he set his right foot
[1:04:25] upon the sea and his left foot upon the
[1:04:26] earth and cried with a loud voice as
[1:04:29] when a lion roars and when he had cried
[1:04:32] seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:04:35] write those mysteries amen and when the
[1:04:41] seven thunders had uttered their voices
[1:04:42] I was about to write and I heard a voice
[1:04:45] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:04:47] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:04:48] and write them not in the angel which I
[1:04:52] saw stand upon the sea upon the earth
[1:04:54] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:04:57] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:04:59] created heaven earth and the things that
[1:05:01] therein are in the earth and the things
[1:05:03] that therein are and the sea and the
[1:05:06] things which are therein that there
[1:05:07] should be time no longer amen so that
[1:05:11] little book was open he meant to Christ
[1:05:14] amen when he can't raise from the dead
[1:05:17] amen he would he said all power is given
[1:05:20] unto me both in heaven and earth hey man
[1:05:23] that book was opened unto Him amen
[1:05:27] that's the reason why it says that but
[1:05:31] yet it still was not open to John right
[1:05:34] now watch this because remember as when
[1:05:39] he said there were seven thunders they
[1:05:40] uttered their voices in other words and
[1:05:42] well let's just keep reading it says but
[1:05:44] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:05:46] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:05:47] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:05:49] had declared to his servants the
[1:05:51] prophets
[1:05:51] we know that speaks of the angel they
[1:05:53] men they came in this hour day amen and
[1:05:55] the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:05:57] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:05:59] the little book it Riddle rates which is
[1:06:03] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:06:06] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:06:09] amen you see how detailed the scripture
[1:06:13] is don't just take the little book take
[1:06:15] the little book that's open any man in
[1:06:19] the hand of the angel which is Jesus
[1:06:21] Christ right and why and I went unto the
[1:06:24] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:06:26] little book
[1:06:30] why didn't he say give me the open book
[1:06:33] because it wasn't open to him and and he
[1:06:38] said up to me take it give it give me
[1:06:40] the little book and he said unto me take
[1:06:42] it and eat it up and it shall make that
[1:06:44] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:06:45] mouth sweet as honey
[1:06:46] so he obeyed and he said and I took the
[1:06:49] little book out of the Angels hand and
[1:06:51] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:06:54] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[1:06:56] he didn't say as soon as I had eaten up
[1:06:59] three quarters of it or or half of it
[1:07:02] ain't half of it I saved the rest of it
[1:07:05] for tomorrow
[1:07:07] no he said as soon as I got that book
[1:07:10] and I ate it my belly was bitter and he
[1:07:15] said unto me thou Jesus Christ said unto
[1:07:19] Him and remember bright John types the
[1:07:22] bride thou must prophesy again before
[1:07:25] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:07:27] kings amen
[1:07:29] so John that book was not open to him
[1:07:33] until that book was in him when that
[1:07:38] book is in you amen
[1:07:40] that journal life is in you amen then
[1:07:43] you can say the full revelation of Jesus
[1:07:46] Christ dwelleth in me amen praise God
[1:07:49] amen it's that's why it's but it's you
[1:07:53] have to eat the book now we in this our
[1:07:56] day we're eating little by little right
[1:07:59] I can't take a whole pizza and swallow
[1:08:03] it whole that'd be kind of tough to do
[1:08:08] maybe somebody with big old mouth might
[1:08:12] know but most people would not be able
[1:08:14] to eat a whole pizza right you have to
[1:08:17] eat it by slices amen and it's the same
[1:08:21] thing in this our day you have to take
[1:08:23] this revelation by slices amen
[1:08:27] but even that one slice Saints
[1:08:34] even that first slice it's still God
[1:08:38] you're born at faith that's born again
[1:08:42] when you're born again at faith that's
[1:08:43] full that's God dwelling in you just as
[1:08:45] much as that last slice right that
[1:08:50] seventh slice is just as much God amen
[1:08:54] until finally the whole thing is in you
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:00] and you gulp it down with a coca-cola
[1:09:04] praise God amen
[1:09:08] so it's not until that whole book a man
[1:09:12] is in you amen that you can that that
[1:09:15] full revelation amen is is amen and when
[1:09:19] that revelation and now now I like I
[1:09:21] like that it says they says that you
[1:09:23] must prophesy again it reminds me it
[1:09:25] reminds me of of those of those of
[1:09:28] Ezekiel's dry bones amen
[1:09:30] remember memories equals dry bones and
[1:09:32] when the God told Ezekiel and said
[1:09:34] prophesy unto these bones when he was in
[1:09:36] that in that little Valley and he saw a
[1:09:39] bunch of dead bones everywhere he said
[1:09:41] prophesy unto these bones and he did he
[1:09:43] said exactly what about what the Lord
[1:09:45] told him to say to those bones the bones
[1:09:48] came up and and and and and they got
[1:09:51] they they they put flesh they put flesh
[1:09:54] on them a flesh was put on them and all
[1:09:57] the bones were coming together and
[1:09:59] things like that and you thought what
[1:10:02] cable that was great that was wonderful
[1:10:04] but the but the Bible continues to
[1:10:07] saying that same scripture he told him
[1:10:09] to prophesy again amen if you keep
[1:10:12] reading and say you prophesy again and
[1:10:14] and and and say winds from the from the
[1:10:17] four of probably what it was four four
[1:10:20] corners or something like that you say
[1:10:22] and bring life to these bones that they
[1:10:25] might live and it was until that life
[1:10:28] came to those bones then those bones
[1:10:31] started moving amen it's not until
[1:10:34] though the life of God amen it's not
[1:10:36] until it's not until that fullness amen
[1:10:39] the full this broad must prophesy again
[1:10:41] amen and once he prophesized again with
[1:10:45] with conviction with this full word in
[1:10:48] her
[1:10:48] with this fullness of the revelation of
[1:10:50] Jesus Christ dwelling in you then you
[1:10:52] can call the dead from the ground amen
[1:10:56] think about that with Ezekiel's bones
[1:10:59] when when they were zekiel prophesied
[1:11:02] again and that life came to those bones
[1:11:04] amen then you as the Bride of Christ
[1:11:07] with this fullness of the revelation can
[1:11:09] prophesy again and those those Saints
[1:11:12] are gonna have to hear those dead Saints
[1:11:14] they're gonna have to listen to that
[1:11:15] prophecy and say my goodness somebody's
[1:11:17] calling me my loved ones calling me I
[1:11:19] better go amen praise the Lord
[1:11:24] think about that sense that's lovely
[1:11:27] Lokar brother Brennan says here in in in
[1:11:30] in the ninth in the ninth one the
[1:11:33] brothers could bring it up the ninth
[1:11:36] quote now this messenger of Malachi for
[1:11:41] in Revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:11:43] things one according to Malachi for he
[1:11:45] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:11:47] the father's two he will reveal the
[1:11:50] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:11:52] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:11:56] contained in the seven seals that's what
[1:12:00] those seven thunders are there are in
[1:12:04] the seven seals but are we in the seven
[1:12:08] seals are we looking into the seven
[1:12:10] seals are we really digging into the
[1:12:12] seven seals amen because those seven
[1:12:16] thunders amen are within the seven seals
[1:12:19] is what brother Branham said there it
[1:12:23] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:12:26] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[1:12:28] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:12:30] exactly so brother brother Dale reads
[1:12:33] that rossette quote many times amen
[1:12:37] now the brothers could bring the the
[1:12:40] picture the next picture Amen just uh
[1:12:47] the church age I guess I guess it's not
[1:12:53] there that the seven church ages praise
[1:12:57] God
[1:13:00] amen praise the Lord
[1:13:04] hmm now it's through these seven layers
[1:13:11] amen that God is building his body amen
[1:13:16] praise God
[1:13:17] and I've said before I just for me this
[1:13:20] is just me I know what the dark parts
[1:13:23] represent I know that that's the
[1:13:24] darkness within the age and stuff like
[1:13:26] that but if you're looking at it from
[1:13:28] far off to me it just seems like it's a
[1:13:30] body that's laying down like this you
[1:13:34] know that's just to me you know I don't
[1:13:38] say that as a doctor or nothing like
[1:13:39] that
[1:13:39] and at the end time that body's gonna
[1:13:42] raise amen because at the end Saints
[1:13:46] when you're when you're raising in from
[1:13:48] the bed at in the morning what raises
[1:13:50] first your feet well my hand raises
[1:13:54] first maybe it does to turn off the
[1:13:56] alarm clock put it on snooze about five
[1:14:02] times
[1:14:03] that's what Minds does you know I'm late
[1:14:08] all the time I need to I need to put
[1:14:13] that snooze that phone in somewhere else
[1:14:17] you pray for me but you see Saints and
[1:14:23] and I can't help to think it's like that
[1:14:26] movie that old movie Frankenstein you
[1:14:29] know I hate to use this analogy remember
[1:14:31] when when that wind a scientist or that
[1:14:33] doctor or whatever his name was I think
[1:14:35] it was that was his name okay
[1:14:41] I thought Frankenstein was the monster
[1:14:45] all right you see a dad on my 80s and
[1:14:50] 90s kid all right but you see he had
[1:14:55] this body that he wanted to Turay he
[1:14:59] wanted to create a body something that
[1:15:01] was living and walking I don't know all
[1:15:03] the story but he finally got it built
[1:15:06] out right and at the end he needed a
[1:15:10] brain right he needed you needed he
[1:15:13] needed
[1:15:13] so something to give it to give it so
[1:15:16] they can have life right and that's the
[1:15:21] same thing Amen Saints and this hour
[1:15:23] amen brother Branham talks about how how
[1:15:25] the body was built from the feet first
[1:15:27] amen and on down up to the to the to the
[1:15:32] to the head to the intelligence right or
[1:15:36] to the UH to the eyes to the prophetic
[1:15:38] you know and then now to the head to
[1:15:40] intelligence right amen
[1:15:43] which is Jesus Christ amen that
[1:15:46] headstone praise God and then saying say
[1:15:50] man when this when this when when the
[1:15:52] bride catches a man whom she really
[1:15:54] knows what she understands what she
[1:15:55] really ours and it's revealed to her
[1:15:57] amen that's the reason why this the
[1:15:59] Saints are coming out the ground amen
[1:16:01] right god this body is raising amen
[1:16:04] praise God that's why the Bible says
[1:16:06] that the first shall be last and the
[1:16:08] last shall be first
[1:16:10] amen amen because why the heads coming
[1:16:17] up first us the 11th hour workers and
[1:16:21] all that right we get the same payment
[1:16:23] that right but we get the furtherance of
[1:16:28] the revelation amen
[1:16:30] that's why this parts coming up first
[1:16:32] amen and then these will follow Amen
[1:16:35] praise the Lord Jesus I hope that that
[1:16:37] that you see that a little bit different
[1:16:39] Amen I mean not not any doctor or
[1:16:42] anything like that but I just that's
[1:16:44] just how I see that Amen praise God now
[1:16:48] brother Branham says says here in in in
[1:16:50] quote number 10 we're almost done
[1:16:52] oh not 10 I'm sorry number 9 oh no 10 10
[1:16:58] yes and his body will do the works that
[1:17:02] he promised like in mark 16 and so forth
[1:17:04] his body was not held in the grave but
[1:17:07] was recognized with him in the
[1:17:08] resurrection do you get it then the body
[1:17:12] of his believing children will not be
[1:17:14] held in the grave when he comes but will
[1:17:17] be recognized with him because he died
[1:17:20] for the purpose to resurrect his bride
[1:17:23] the body but he had to resurrect first
[1:17:27] right recognized because it is his body
[1:17:30] because it's the words let's scroll down
[1:17:32] is there more his word which is which he
[1:17:37] is has been has been begin to be risen
[1:17:39] amen is that words begin to be risen in
[1:17:42] you and I amen praise God the word that
[1:17:46] down through the age of Luther Wesley C
[1:17:49] has began to raise up to its power there
[1:17:52] it began to move then it moved a little
[1:17:54] more now it's coming up to an
[1:17:56] identification Amen it's coming up to
[1:18:00] and I'd ever just like the rapper's amen
[1:18:02] it's finally coming up to an
[1:18:03] identification amen of who Christ is
[1:18:06] they men see watch now to the life in
[1:18:10] the body is a vindication of the rapture
[1:18:12] is at hand
[1:18:14] well in other words when that
[1:18:16] resurrection takes place that's of
[1:18:18] indication that the rapture is at hand
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:21] because there's life then right and dr.
[1:18:28] Frankenstein is saying is alive its
[1:18:31] alive you can say they're alive they're
[1:18:37] alive they're alive and the rapture
[1:18:40] takes place
[1:18:42] it's a vindication of the rapture is at
[1:18:44] hand when you see the headship in the
[1:18:46] body becoming one and the fullness of
[1:18:49] the measure of his manifestation shows
[1:18:52] that the body is about ready to be
[1:18:55] received to the headship Amen praise the
[1:18:59] Lord Jesus amen and then the brothers
[1:19:02] can bring up the last picture amen
[1:19:04] this is what we want to come to saints
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:09] Christ and the brighter one I loved this
[1:19:12] picture amen because it's the body of
[1:19:18] Christ being built just like the body of
[1:19:20] Christ was built through and the Old
[1:19:22] Testament throughout all the Old
[1:19:24] Testament by the prophets the word amen
[1:19:28] the word that they had for their time
[1:19:30] was building the body of Christ in
[1:19:33] layers until finally it came to a head
[1:19:36] and he came to a
[1:19:38] when he came when he came here on earth
[1:19:42] it was in its apex then right that was
[1:19:47] the son of man praise the Lord and then
[1:19:50] the same thing Amen in the Son of Man
[1:19:53] turn that headstone was rejected by the
[1:19:56] by Israel right turn to be the
[1:20:00] cornerstone right and so now the body is
[1:20:03] being built again through these seven
[1:20:06] Church ages right until finally it's
[1:20:09] gonna make its apex amen a culmination
[1:20:12] which is Christ amen be in the head
[1:20:14] praise God I hope that helps you a man I
[1:20:18] hope it wasn't boring to you I hope that
[1:20:21] you get something out of it and then you
[1:20:23] take it with you and ponder it and
[1:20:24] Saints don't just look at this one time
[1:20:27] and say okay I got it
[1:20:28] amen look at it again and read Amen go
[1:20:32] over these quotes amen because we are
[1:20:35] still here my body is still not redeemed
[1:20:39] I'm confessing I'm confessing it my body
[1:20:43] I still needed a redemption of these
[1:20:45] bodies amen we still need that we're
[1:20:47] still waiting for the for the metaphor
[1:20:49] the manifestation of those the Saints
[1:20:51] that are dead to come amen I'm expecting
[1:20:55] to see brother Richard I'm expecting to
[1:20:57] see Gary I'm expecting to see my
[1:20:59] mother-in-law I'm expecting to see all
[1:21:02] these brothers is that you all know
[1:21:03] people who have died in Christ they're
[1:21:06] not here with us yet that means there's
[1:21:08] something we're not kept kept capturing
[1:21:11] yet we haven't gotten this the potential
[1:21:14] we have the potential of the revelation
[1:21:17] of Jesus Christ dwelling in us but it
[1:21:20] needs to manifest on the outside amen so
[1:21:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:21:26] gave to you it's already yours that's
[1:21:29] why I like God uses past tense a lot of
[1:21:32] times because too in his mind it's
[1:21:35] already done and if you read that in
[1:21:37] Revelation chapter 1 verse 1 it says the
[1:21:39] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:21:40] gave to him but put yourself in their
[1:21:44] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:21:45] gave to you and you confess that and you
[1:21:49] build on top of that
[1:21:51] and watch you let you be in the same
[1:21:55] image as that headstone amen praise the
[1:21:57] Lord how many love the Lord Hey praise
