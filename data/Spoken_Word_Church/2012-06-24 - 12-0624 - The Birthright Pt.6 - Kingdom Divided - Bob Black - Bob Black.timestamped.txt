[0:02] all right we're recording now
[0:06] all systems are good yep just like that
[0:09] all right
[0:10] um
[0:11] go ahead and start turning over in the
[0:13] vicinity of First Kings I'm not sure
[0:15] what the security is just yet but um
[0:19] work today we're going to go through
[0:22] read about the sins of jeroboam and uh
[0:26] talk about your move a little bit
[0:29] uh but before we get started I just
[0:32] to kind of
[0:33] get things moving brother Joe sent me
[0:36] this quote last week Joe candidate and
[0:39] uh this was so good I thought I'd read
[0:41] it I thought this was just really
[0:44] helpful because we all have tension in
[0:46] our lives and things that um seems like
[0:49] why shouldn't things be easier and um
[0:53] so listen to this quote I just want this
[0:55] this helped me
[0:56] the uniting time assigned 1963 brother
[0:59] Ram said speaking of tension I was
[1:01] praying about it this morning that's and
[1:03] that's something interesting me praying
[1:05] about afraid about attention what would
[1:07] you do if you didn't have tint so just
[1:09] think of it tension is part of living
[1:11] that kind of encouraged me when I
[1:13] thought that if you had no tension you'd
[1:14] be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no
[1:16] feelings
[1:17] there be nothing you could work on like
[1:19] a husband and wife
[1:20] maybe if she wants to do something and
[1:22] they're trying to work together
[1:23] especially Christians and the other one
[1:25] won't and when you come together to find
[1:28] out what she's doing she finds out I see
[1:29] the tension really brings you closer
[1:31] together somebody tells you that well
[1:33] said just think of the little wife that
[1:35] went under a lot of tension when you
[1:36] wasn't so good or the husband went into
[1:38] her some tension when he wasn't so good
[1:40] then when it's all forgiven look how you
[1:42] feel about it see you've got to have
[1:44] tension that's all
[1:46] he said some people trying to introduce
[1:48] introduce Christianity that you're free
[1:50] from worry or no you're not you're free
[1:52] from hitching oh no you had attention
[1:54] when you become a Christian because he
[1:56] was kind of a sloth you were happy to go
[1:58] lucky whatever was out there not caring
[2:00] what you did
[2:01] like when you become a real Christian
[2:03] every moment you're wondering am I
[2:05] pleasing my Lord if I could hear from
[2:07] him it puts you on tension puts you on
[2:09] heart
[2:10] so attention what's this tension if I
[2:13] could have been born without this
[2:14] tension well if I wouldn't have had this
[2:16] tension I wouldn't have been what I am I
[2:18] wouldn't have been a I wouldn't have
[2:19] been a Christian perhaps it was this
[2:21] tension that drove me to Jesus Christ
[2:23] see so it's been a blessing thing to me
[2:26] so next time you get a little attention
[2:29] in your life thank the Lord because he's
[2:31] helping you a long life away right so
[2:35] um last time
[2:37] that is in United time United Thomas
[2:41] 1963
[2:45] .
[2:47] so we were going through the genealogy
[2:49] and um we talked uh previously about how
[2:53] this song that uh the lineage was split
[2:56] with Solomon
[2:57] um and Judah brings forth Christ from
[3:00] Korea mold and Ephraim
[3:02] represents the many nations the
[3:05] birthright blessing of many nations and
[3:08] um
[3:10] through care level and start off with
[3:12] durable through Israel they went off
[3:15] into captivity and Assyria and then
[3:18] Judah went off into captivity in Babylon
[3:20] and returned after 70 years but the
[3:23] Israel is is was continue to be lost
[3:26] until they began to return to their
[3:28] Homeland
[3:30] but let's um
[3:33] we just reviewed what uh remember the
[3:36] promise to Abraham in Genesis 17 was
[3:39] that for me behold my Covenant is with
[3:41] thee and I shall be a father of many
[3:42] nations neither shout thy name any more
[3:45] we call Abram but thy name shall be
[3:46] Abraham for a father of many nations
[3:48] have I mean
[3:50] and then it's promised to Jacob and
[3:52] Genesis 35 and God said unto him I am
[3:54] God Almighty be fruitful and multiply a
[3:56] nation and a company of Nations shall be
[3:58] of thee and Kings shall come out of thou
[4:00] wounds and then the promise to Ephraim
[4:02] through Jacob when he was blessing and
[4:04] from Manasseh
[4:06] Injustice 48 19 and his father refused
[4:08] and said
[4:10] I know it my son I know it this is
[4:12] Abraham talking he also shall become a
[4:14] people and he's also shall be created
[4:15] but truly his younger brother shall be
[4:17] greater than he and his seed shall
[4:19] become a multitude of Nations
[4:23] and then uh
[4:25] in first Chronicles 5 1. now the sons of
[4:28] Reuben was the firstborn of Israel for
[4:31] he was the first one for for as much as
[4:33] he defiled his father's bed his
[4:35] Birthright was given to the sons of
[4:36] Joseph the son of Israel and the
[4:38] genealogy is not to be recognized after
[4:40] the birthright so remember in Matthew
[4:42] Lou you've got a genealogy through Judah
[4:50] and Matthew and Luke deviates it uh
[4:52] actually I saw him Solomon
[5:04] and uh
[5:07] the birthright
[5:09] doesn't have any kind of genealogy
[5:15] and let's go on to uh
[5:18] I said let's start reading in First
[5:20] Kings let's actually start reading uh
[5:22] keep kind of keep a placeholder on First
[5:25] Kings let's go over to Exodus 13. so now
[5:28] let's read the story of
[5:31] the uh
[5:37] the the ride of the firstborn in Exodus
[5:40] 13 was to be redeemed
[5:45] Christ
[5:49] and so it's kind of thinking of the
[5:51] median Nation if you've got the
[5:53] um
[5:54] the firstborn mule that's us
[6:00] makes just 13 verse
[6:04] 12 through 15.
[6:15] let's actually started over Saloon and
[6:18] it shall be when the Lord shall bring
[6:19] thee into the land of the Canaan Isis he
[6:21] swear unto thee and to thy father and so
[6:23] give it thee that thou shalt sit apart
[6:25] unto the Lord all that open up the
[6:26] Matrix and every person they cometh up a
[6:28] beast which thou Hast the male shall be
[6:31] the Lords and every first lamb and asks
[6:33] this Thou shalt redeem with a lamb and
[6:35] if thou will not redeem it then Thou
[6:36] shalt break his neck and all the
[6:38] firstborn of man among thy children
[6:40] shalt thou redeem and it shall be when
[6:42] thy son asketh thee in time to come say
[6:44] what is this but Thou shalt say unto him
[6:46] by strength of him the Lord brought us
[6:48] out of out from Egypt from the house of
[6:50] bondage and it came to pass when Pharaoh
[6:53] would hardly let us go that the Lord
[6:54] slew all the firstborn in the land of
[6:56] Egypt both the firstborn of man and the
[6:59] firstborn of Beast therefore I sacrifice
[7:00] to the Lord
[7:02] all that open up the Matrix being males
[7:05] but all the firstborn of my children I
[7:06] redeemed and it shall be a token upon
[7:09] thine hand and for frontless between
[7:11] Thine Eyes For by strength of hand the
[7:13] Lord brought us forth out of Egypt so
[7:15] there this is to be remembrance of what
[7:19] happened in Egypt where they had the
[7:21] blood over the door
[7:23] on the littles of the doorpost to remind
[7:25] them that you remember think about how
[7:27] when they were in Egypt the the Angels
[7:31] coming through to take the firstborn and
[7:32] their the firstborn is wondering am I
[7:34] going to be uh am I safe and step
[7:37] outside and look at the
[7:39] um the blood over the door now Us in the
[7:43] many nations were wondering are am I how
[7:46] can I do anything I don't have a
[7:47] genealogy or anything how can I be safe
[7:49] but we're safe in Christ
[7:53] laughs
[7:55] so brother Brandon
[7:58] in the unconditional Covenant that God
[8:00] made with the people in 1954 he said I
[8:02] hear so many now my Armenian brother and
[8:05] I don't aim to rub this in but this may
[8:08] pinch just a little bit but I love you
[8:09] see all right notice now not nothing you
[8:12] can do you might live good all your life
[8:13] and you go to hell it's by the grace of
[8:15] God that you're saving that's right what
[8:16] God has did for you notice the law of
[8:19] redemption the innocent for the guilty
[8:21] what if a little back under the laws of
[8:23] redemption what if a little old cult was
[8:25] born some night a little mule and that
[8:26] little meal was born with both ears
[8:28] hanging down now if anybody knows
[8:30] anything about mules that's an awful
[8:31] mule a mule with his ears hanging down
[8:33] he's no good and he's cross-eyed he's
[8:35] not need his tail sticks right up what a
[8:37] horrible looking creature
[8:39] that poured along you would look in a
[8:42] mirror and had an intelligence he'd say
[8:43] oh my wait till they come out and see me
[8:45] I haven't even got a chance look what a
[8:48] horrible looking thing I am
[8:49] but if his name he knows anything about
[8:51] Redemption she's saying wait a minute
[8:53] honey you fail to understand they're not
[8:55] going to kill you amen they're not even
[8:57] going to even look at you now that's
[8:59] that's the key part it's not even going
[9:01] to even look at you right but you are
[9:03] born with a Birthright and that's the
[9:06] birthright right the birthright is that
[9:08] you you have a review that they're not
[9:11] even going to look at you they're going
[9:12] to look at you in Christ with blood over
[9:15] the little of the door of your heart
[9:17] and lower Grace he said I remember a
[9:20] little story I don't know whether I ever
[9:21] told you or not it's just a little
[9:23] fiction story all right under the law of
[9:25] the old mother horse had a little cold
[9:26] and it was a new you know and his ears
[9:28] broke down his knees knocked and oh what
[9:30] a cross-eyed horrible looking you for
[9:32] that mule if he could look at himself
[9:34] and say oh my when the master comes out
[9:36] he'll kill me because he wouldn't feed
[9:38] me I'm not worthy to live look at me
[9:40] with a horrible looking mess I am but if
[9:42] the mother could speak back a little
[9:44] fella she'd say wait a minute honey you
[9:45] can live because you're my first
[9:48] you have a Birthright now when the
[9:50] master comes out and sees you in all
[9:52] your condition he has to go back and get
[9:53] a lamb without a blemish on it and kill
[9:55] it so that that crippled up looking mule
[9:58] could live you see the priests never
[10:00] seen a mule he saw the lamb it wasn't
[10:03] whether the meal was perfect
[10:05] had to be the perfect lamb and when you
[10:09] think about the prom the birthright
[10:11] promises through Abraham
[10:13] it's kind of confusing because you uh
[10:16] you kind of tend to see just the lineage
[10:18] of Christ this is the Redeemer the
[10:21] birthright promises our our right to be
[10:24] redeemed because he paid the price
[10:29] not not all but based on our Perfection
[10:32] but from his profession and I just have
[10:35] this quote in here about on conferences
[10:37] in the sermon conferences 1963 wrote
[10:40] around said if God judges the World by
[10:42] the Catholic Church the Protestant is
[10:44] lost he joins it by the Protestants
[10:46] which one he judged by the Catholic
[10:48] Church there's many different fears of
[10:49] the Spheres the Catholic church so which
[10:52] one is it going to be you see a person
[10:54] will be confused you wouldn't know what
[10:55] to do but here's what God was judging by
[10:57] the word that's the standard heavens and
[10:59] earth will pass away but my words shall
[11:01] never never fail upon this I take my
[11:03] stand all of the grounds to seeking sand
[11:05] all of the grounds of sinking sand on
[11:08] Christ the solid rock I stand I'm
[11:10] depending on it I'm not trusting in what
[11:12] I am I'm trusting what he is I cannot I
[11:14] cannot go to heaven Jesus said I had to
[11:16] be perfect to get there to be there for
[11:18] perfect even as your father in Heaven
[11:20] how can you be when you got look not at
[11:22] you but at your sacrifice
[11:24] so
[11:26] now let's I'll just read first
[11:29] Chronicles 5 2.
[11:31] actually I already talked about that how
[11:33] the birthright the genealogy is not
[11:36] wrecking after the birthright
[11:37] and then
[11:39] um
[11:40] in Genesis 48 it talks about how that
[11:43] Birthright was uh given to the younger
[11:47] Ephraim over Manasseh and Ephraim so you
[11:50] got Manassas should have had the
[11:52] birthright
[11:57] the law
[12:00] but instead of Vanessa went to the
[12:02] younger
[12:03] they're from actually terrible almost
[12:06] descended from everyone
[12:08] who is Christ
[12:12] because we're not saved by the law we're
[12:15] saying by
[12:16] improvised
[12:20] and uh that's what brother Brown said in
[12:22] the countdown 1964. so
[12:25] um
[12:27] now let's look at the Kingdom being
[12:28] divided the kingdom was actually divided
[12:31] really quickly right after Saul's death
[12:33] when uh
[12:35] Saul's son Easter Chef would rule over
[12:37] Israel Abner actually set him up said
[12:39] I'm going to make it yourself to the
[12:41] ruler and then uh David got Judah and
[12:45] then later on Abner came over to David's
[12:47] side and David became ruler over all
[12:50] Israel and Judah together and then uh in
[12:54] First Kings I'll just read where uh the
[12:56] the reason
[12:59] why uh the kingdom was split because of
[13:03] what Solomon did in First Kings 11.
[13:16] First Kings 11
[13:23] verse 11 through 13. wherefore the Lord
[13:26] said unto Solomon for as much as this is
[13:28] done of thee announced not kept my
[13:30] Covenant and my statutes which I can
[13:31] which I've commanded Thee I was surely
[13:33] we're in the Kingdom from thee give it
[13:35] to thy servant notwithstanding in the
[13:36] days will not do it for David thy
[13:39] servant thy father say but I will Rend
[13:41] it out of the end of thy son how be it I
[13:43] will not run away all the kingdom but
[13:44] we'll give one tribe that thy son or
[13:46] David my servant sake for Jerusalem sake
[13:49] which I have chosen
[13:50] and um
[13:52] second chronicles 11 tells the story of
[13:54] the division of the two kingdoms how
[13:56] that uh
[13:57] durable I mean readable Solomon remember
[14:02] Solomon had put in heavy taxes to build
[14:04] the temple and rebound and said well I'm
[14:06] going to continue those taxes and make
[14:07] them even worse and the people
[14:09] revolvered and went after Dearborn
[14:12] but remember last time we were talking
[14:14] about how the the genes of God God flips
[14:18] on the little attributes and manifests
[14:20] his word in us and his great plan and
[14:23] you can see that and every uh we got due
[14:26] to an Ephraim are kind of the main
[14:27] players but all the 12 tribes had a part
[14:30] to play and uh manifesting Christ and
[14:33] manifesting his word
[14:35] ah so this is all just part of God's
[14:38] plan it's part of his predestinated plan
[14:39] to bring about his word
[14:43] um and Jeremiah 33 it talked about the
[14:46] two families that God has chosen which
[14:49] is uh
[14:58] so you got it and set that up
[15:04] and
[15:19] from velocity
[15:28] okay so the next thing I want to talk
[15:30] about without your April is it can be a
[15:33] little confusing when you read the
[15:34] scripture that um
[15:35] did I get it right no I was just saying
[15:38] there was a player on the on the board
[15:40] okay and I couldn't associate
[15:45] um as you read this from this uh the
[15:50] many nations are to go by many names
[15:54] from Israel
[16:00] Samaria
[16:02] and it can be a little huge it just keep
[16:05] track of everything just cause the
[16:06] terminology but um the reason uh so
[16:10] Samaria was actually the capital of
[16:12] Israel Israel the Jerusalem was the
[16:14] capital of
[16:15] was the capital of Judah
[16:19] and then uh Samaria was the capital of
[16:23] Israel and the reason we know that is
[16:26] because just a little history on that
[16:28] jeroboa rain and Chico
[16:30] and then
[16:35] later on they show I moved in capital to
[16:37] tearsome
[16:39] and then zimmery uh reigned for seven
[16:41] days and burned the King's death house
[16:43] down on his own head and then Armory
[16:45] bought a hill from Shamar and built the
[16:47] city of Samaria so that's how Samaria
[16:49] ended up being the capital of Israel and
[16:51] uh brother Burnham said the way of a
[16:52] true prophet of God in 1962 and Samaria
[16:54] was the Capital One of the capitals at
[16:56] the time of the reign of jeroboil and it
[16:59] kind of helps when you're looking at
[17:00] scriptures like hope and Isaiah where he
[17:02] said um thy Castle Samaria has to cast
[17:05] they offer my anger is kennel against
[17:07] thee against them how long will it be
[17:09] here they attended nscc and Jose 7 1
[17:11] when I would have healed Israel then the
[17:14] iniquity of Ephraim was discovered in
[17:15] the wickedness of Samaria for they
[17:17] commit falsehood and the thief coming in
[17:19] coming in and the troop of robber
[17:21] spoiled it without
[17:28] all these names refer to
[17:31] um
[17:32] for the same thing
[17:35] and now
[17:37] let's kind of follow um
[17:40] the story of Dearborn
[17:44] because this is very interesting let's
[17:46] look at First Kings chapter 12.
[17:59] see what Dearborn is
[18:07] and why it was so bad
[18:10] you know we know terrible set up the
[18:12] golden calves and Bethlehem but
[18:15] it really had a lasting impact on all of
[18:19] Israel
[18:20] so First Kings chapter 12 26 through 30.
[18:30] actually it started verse 28
[18:34] 6
[18:35] and durable and send in his heart now
[18:37] shall the kingdom return to the House of
[18:39] David if his people go up to do
[18:40] sacrifice in the house of the Lord
[18:42] Jerusalem they show the heart of this
[18:44] people turning into under their lord
[18:45] even into rehabolism and they shall kill
[18:48] me and go again to re-evolt them here
[18:51] we're pulling the king to council to
[18:53] make two calves of gold instead of them
[18:55] and it's too much for you to go up to
[18:56] Jerusalem Behold thy God the bill of
[18:58] Israel which brought me up out of the
[19:00] land of Egypt
[19:03] and he said the one in Bethel and the
[19:05] other putty and Dan and this thing
[19:06] became a sin for the people who went to
[19:07] worship before the one even a sedan and
[19:10] he made an House of high places and made
[19:12] Creeks of the lowest of the people which
[19:14] were not of the sons of Levi
[19:16] and terrible more than the feast in the
[19:18] eight month and goes on so that what
[19:20] garibald did was he set up the two
[19:22] golden calves
[19:30] see later on what the Kings after him
[19:32] did
[19:34] so let's turn to First Kings 15.
[19:38] 26 the next one in line after him kind
[19:41] of kind of go down all through all the
[19:43] kings of Israel
[19:46] and see if they ever departed from his
[19:49] way or chapter 15 verse 26
[19:53] nadab the son of terrible and began ran
[19:55] over Israel in the second year basic
[19:57] king of Judah and regular original two
[19:58] years and he did evil in the side of the
[20:00] Lord and walked in the way of his father
[20:01] and in his sin we're in where with you
[20:03] made Israel to sin so he walked he
[20:06] stayed in the Sands of Dearborn
[20:08] quite happy
[20:13] let's go to bayesia First Kings 15 34.
[20:19] down the page
[20:21] when Basia did evil in the side of the
[20:22] Lord and walked in the way of dear
[20:24] evolvement in his scene where
[20:26] with he made Israel to say
[20:29] and then let's go to Eli who reigned for
[20:33] two years First Kings 16 13.
[20:41] for all the sins of baisha and the sins
[20:43] of Eli his son by which they sent him by
[20:45] which they made Israel sin provoking the
[20:47] Lord God of Israel to anger with their
[20:48] amenities
[20:49] see
[20:57] sorry we know
[21:00] 15 13.
[21:10] I'm written down a wrong scripture verse
[21:13] 15 says
[21:15] okay
[21:17] so uh Eli continued on the sense of
[21:20] Dearborn and then uh
[21:26] please
[21:33] yeah for all the sins of baisha
[21:36] and the sins of Eli so so he didn't
[21:38] apart from the sins of his father and
[21:41] then first King 16 18.
[21:48] and they came to pass when zimmery saw
[21:50] that the city was taken
[21:56] said he went into the promise of the
[21:57] King's house and burnt the King's house
[21:59] over him with fire
[22:00] and died for his sins what she sinned
[22:02] and doing evil on the side of the Lord
[22:03] and walking in the way of jeroboam and
[22:05] seeing what you did to make Israel to
[22:07] sin so he didn't perform either
[22:12] even though
[22:14] he only ran one week
[22:20] kind of just for Armory uh in first king
[22:24] 16.5
[22:25] uh
[22:27] go down a few verses Omri raw evil in
[22:30] the eyes of the Lord and didn't worse
[22:31] than all that were beforehand before he
[22:33] walked in all the way up terrible the
[22:35] sun will be back in an innocent where
[22:37] with he made Israel's sins and wrote The
[22:39] Lord God of Israel to anger when they're
[22:40] abandons
[22:41] and I'm going to skip forward
[22:48] let's go to Second Kings chapter 10. it
[22:53] actually repeats each King it says you
[22:55] did worse and all that were for him or
[22:57] plead them to the sins of jeroboa
[23:01] um
[23:01] Yahoo and
[23:03] second Kings 10 29.
[23:09] now this is peculiar because you would
[23:11] think you know after remember yay Who
[23:12] tricked out all the beow worshipers into
[23:15] coming to the house of Baal and they
[23:17] flew them all once they had he said if
[23:19] you worship Bell everybody come that
[23:21] works for today all the priests
[23:22] everybody come to the house of hell and
[23:24] they all gathered they tricked them they
[23:26] said I'll kill them all I killed him he
[23:28] killed everybody so you think okay well
[23:30] yay finally we got a king that departed
[23:32] from says gerbola let's see um what it
[23:35] says about him chapter 10 verse 29.
[23:41] I'll be it from the sins of jeribo and
[23:43] the son of anybody who made Israel to
[23:45] San Diego who departed not from after
[23:46] them to win the golden calves that were
[23:48] in Bethlehem that were in Dan
[23:51] so he did a good job getting rid of all
[23:53] the priests and everything but he still
[23:55] left the golden calves that caused
[23:56] Israel to sin I remember during all this
[23:59] time of Israel uh you got prophets like
[24:02] uh Elijah that was sent to the Israelite
[24:05] prophets of Baal
[24:06] and so and they and the children of
[24:09] Israel said the Lord he is God after
[24:11] they saw what God had hit how he
[24:13] consumed the ultimate fire but they
[24:14] still there's two golden calves in
[24:17] Bethlehem Dam caused Israel to depart
[24:19] from the ways of God
[24:24] and then uh Jehovah has followed the
[24:27] sins of jeroboam joash and second Kings
[24:30] 13 11 departed not from all the sins of
[24:32] jeroboam jeroboam II
[24:35] in Second Kings 14 24.
[24:44] and he did that which was evil in the
[24:46] size of the Lord he departed not from
[24:47] all the sins of durable and the son of
[24:49] Nevada who made Israel to sing
[24:52] Zachariah Second Kings 15 9 departed not
[24:55] from the sins of jeroboa shallow Marine
[24:58] one month and nothing was reported about
[25:00] his sins that's the only one that did
[25:02] not that it doesn't say what his sins
[25:04] were and then uh
[25:14] now the interesting thing about this the
[25:17] dynasties of Israel is well
[25:21] for you
[25:24] you don't have anybody that is it
[25:26] continues from um father to son
[25:30] father son
[25:32] all the way down
[25:34] uh Efron
[25:36] it's broken up into eight dynasties
[25:40] so somebody would come along and uh if
[25:43] you don't want if the current king and
[25:45] the David Kim the king and then for a
[25:47] couple of years
[25:49] and then they would uh
[25:51] when they would get killed or
[25:54] after a few Generations
[25:58] I'm just doing a little history lesson
[26:01] um
[26:02] I'll show you the last king
[26:05] he reigned for 20 years 20 years and
[26:07] what the Bible says about him in Second
[26:09] Kings 17 2 he did that which was evil
[26:12] but not as the Kings of Israel that were
[26:13] before him
[26:15] but um
[26:18] Jose uh paid tribute to uh shamanice or
[26:22] the fifth of Assyria and he stopped
[26:24] famous because he was expecting the king
[26:26] of Egypt so to come to his Aid well
[26:30] somebody's going to come help me so so
[26:32] uh didn't the salmon this or arrested
[26:35] her saying late Seas just some area
[26:38] and then the city fell but shamanisser
[26:40] died so the armies of Assyria were
[26:42] recalled to ensure the succession of
[26:44] Sargon II
[26:46] and uh later on Sargon returned in the
[26:49] port of the citizens of Israel beyond
[26:50] the Euphrates and settled others in
[26:51] their place now this is kind of
[26:53] apparently important because this this
[26:55] is the history of Samaria that this is
[26:57] why the Jews uh especially during the
[26:59] time of Christ hated the Samaritans so
[27:02] much that's why I kind of one of the
[27:05] reasons why the Good Samaritan is if you
[27:08] kind of understand it from this
[27:09] perspective it's so important that you
[27:11] know there's the Levi and that all the
[27:13] people that you thought would be good
[27:14] that would help this person but somebody
[27:16] that that's used despised from Samaria
[27:20] would help
[27:24] let's turn into second Kings
[27:26] chapter 17 and just kind of look at the
[27:29] history of Samaria
[27:33] chapter 17 verse 6.
[27:36] in the ninth year of Hosea the king of
[27:39] Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel
[27:42] away into a Syria and placed them in
[27:44] Holland in apple or by the river of
[27:46] dozen in this in the city of the medes
[27:50] I'm going to read down to verse
[27:54] 24 birthday or so it was the two
[27:58] individual had sinned against the Lord
[27:59] Our God which had brought them up out of
[28:00] the land of Egypt from under the hand of
[28:02] pharaoh king of Egypt and had feared
[28:03] other gods and walked in the statues of
[28:05] the Heathen in the Lord cast out from
[28:07] before the children of Israel now the
[28:09] Kings of Israel which they had made
[28:11] and the children of Israel did secretly
[28:12] those things but they were not right
[28:14] against the Lord their God and they
[28:15] built Empire places in all their cities
[28:17] from the Tower of the watch went to the
[28:18] fence City and they set them up images
[28:19] and grooves and every high heel and
[28:22] under every Green Tree
[28:24] and there they burn incense and all the
[28:26] high places
[28:28] carried away before they've been raw
[28:30] wicked things to provoke the Lord to
[28:32] anger for they served Idols where the
[28:33] old and said unto them ye shall not do
[28:35] this thing yet the Lord testified
[28:37] against Israel and against you about all
[28:39] the prophets Allah Allah are saying
[28:41] turning from your evil ways
[28:43] keep my Commandments and my statutes
[28:45] according to all the Lords I commanded
[28:46] your fathers which I sent to you by my
[28:49] service the prophets I was standing they
[28:52] were not here but hardened their necks
[28:53] like to the nick of their fathers that
[28:54] did not believe in the Lord their God
[28:56] and they rejected his statutes and his
[28:58] Covenant that he made with their fathers
[29:00] and his testimonies when she testified
[29:01] against them and they followed vanity
[29:03] and became Vain and went after the
[29:05] Heathen that were round about they're
[29:06] concerning him the Lord had charged them
[29:08] that they should not do like them
[29:09] and they left all the Commandments of
[29:11] the Lord their God and made them molten
[29:12] images even two cows and made a Grove
[29:14] and worshiped all Oaks of heaven and
[29:16] served Baal and they caused their sons
[29:18] and their daughters to pass through the
[29:19] fire and his divination and enchantments
[29:21] and sold themselves to do evil on the
[29:23] side of the Lord to provoke him to anger
[29:25] therefore the Lord was very angry with
[29:27] Israel and removed him out of his sight
[29:28] there was none left but the tribe of
[29:30] Judah only also Judah kept not the
[29:33] Commandments of the Lord their God would
[29:34] walk in the statues of Israel which they
[29:36] made
[29:37] and the Lord rejected all the seed
[29:39] original and afflict them and deliver
[29:40] them into the hand of spoilers until he
[29:42] had cast him out of his sight for he ran
[29:45] Israel from the House of David and they
[29:46] made terrible and the son of anus and
[29:48] they were at King and jeroboam dream
[29:50] Israel from following the Lord and made
[29:51] them sin a great sin for the children of
[29:54] Israel wants and all the sins of
[29:56] jeroboam which he did that departed not
[29:58] from them until the Lord removed Israel
[30:00] out of his sightings he has set by all
[30:02] his servants the prophets so was Israel
[30:04] carried away out of their own land to
[30:06] Syria unto this day
[30:07] and the king of Syria brought me in from
[30:10] Babylon from Cutlery from Iowa and from
[30:12] home office from
[30:14] Sephora fighting and placed them in the
[30:16] cities of Samaria instead of the
[30:18] children of Israel and they possessed
[30:19] some area I dwell in the cities thereof
[30:21] so that's the last verse that's kind of
[30:23] tells the history of how they were sent
[30:25] off into Assyria and the last verse says
[30:27] so they it took Israel sent them off to
[30:30] a Syria and then the kingdom of Syria
[30:33] took men from Babylon and from all these
[30:35] places that were not Jews and placed
[30:37] them into the land of Assyria so now
[30:39] going forward in Samaria you've got a
[30:42] bunch of people that really don't have a
[30:45] genealogy they're from all over and they
[30:47] start reading with the uh the ones that
[30:50] are left over Judah and uh
[30:53] uh later on they cause cause problems
[30:55] with uh the when they come back to
[30:58] rebuild the Temple of the an army of
[31:01] Sumerians you think they're the original
[31:03] Sumerians but they're not they're this
[31:05] mixed uh bunch of uh
[31:10] people that don't have really have any
[31:11] they didn't have any place being there
[31:14] to begin with and um it's interesting if
[31:17] you look in the New Testament all the
[31:19] Samaritans it's uh Jesus used there was
[31:23] a lot of Samaritans that dealt with
[31:25] Jesus like the story of the Good
[31:27] Samaritan and um
[31:29] believe the woman at the Wells from
[31:31] Samaria
[31:33] um anyway that's uh let's go ahead and
[31:36] stop right there
[32:04] building
[32:11] very easy
