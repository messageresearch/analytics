[0:21] shining in our and
[0:51] how about it
[0:55] [Music]
[1:02] do you believe
[1:04] you love it
[1:08] [Music]
[1:20] amen and amen and amen and I want to see
[1:22] him don't you
[1:23] there just nobody in the house of the
[1:25] Lord good to be here in the middle of
[1:27] the week so let's just get right on the
[1:30] end to our thought tonight of what I
[1:33] want to try to present just a little
[1:35] something the church for us to think on
[1:36] and then move on from there
[1:39] if you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[1:40] turn to Isaiah 59 and we'll read from
[1:50] verse on 19 and 21 okay
[1:56] just pray one for another two Lord we
[1:58] bless and lead in all things we're in a
[2:01] horrible day and horrible time but God
[2:04] is still the same so that's what we
[2:07] should be thinking about those times
[2:09] amen whether we thank you for or not and
[2:12] the time that we can gather together and
[2:13] we ask you now to just bless each one
[2:16] and just forgive our sins cleanse us
[2:19] from all unrighteousness help us to walk
[2:21] in you let your love in your grace be
[2:23] Lord sufficient for everything and we
[2:26] know it is got each one remember the
[2:29] sick among us Lord they were brother
[2:31] dick to our Lord and just deliver him
[2:33] out of that and he was sister Gail
[2:35] they're in the hospital room having to
[2:37] stay with him all the time Lord and we
[2:39] just pray that you would be with them
[2:41] and give her strength encouraging you
[2:44] and just bless and remember for the isle
[2:46] and sister Anna Lord and for brother
[2:49] Colley then all he's doing good and
[2:52] getting good reports sometimes so we
[2:54] would praise you and thank you have your
[2:56] way now and guide us as we read your
[2:59] word you come on the scene and just take
[3:02] control in Jesus name Amen so we'll go
[3:06] to verse 19
[3:14] this is a kind of a background I'm just
[3:16] using it as a an insert to pick up the
[3:20] point from the scripture that we were
[3:22] using but really what it is it's a
[3:24] telling of the things and and all like
[3:26] that and it's bragging about Israel in
[3:29] the natural which is Israel in the
[3:31] spiritual the you and I and all and it's
[3:34] coming down to and saves like says this
[3:36] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[3:40] from the West and his glory from the
[3:42] rising of the Sun when the enemy shall
[3:45] come in like a flood the Spirit of the
[3:48] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[3:49] him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[3:53] now if you'll go to Romans 11:26 you'll
[3:56] see that it says the Redeemer comes out
[3:59] as iron the outer zone which is the
[4:02] bride here is to Zion which is coming to
[4:05] our way and bringing it toward the bride
[4:08] you know and it says they shall come to
[4:11] Zion and to them that turn from
[4:13] transgression in Jacob says the Lord as
[4:16] for me this is my covenant with them
[4:18] says the Lord my spirit is upon thee and
[4:22] my words which I have put in thy mouth
[4:25] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[4:28] out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of
[4:32] the mouth of thy seed seed look at that
[4:35] promise says the Lord from henceforth
[4:38] and forever you may be seated the Lord
[4:41] at his blessing to the reading of the
[4:43] word the thank everybody for praying for
[4:46] us without her shoulder they got me free
[4:49] and and turned me loose yesterday and
[4:51] said I could go back to working and only
[4:56] problem was I forgot to ask him he
[4:58] didn't say I could work but that's nanny
[5:01] shaking her head but I wound up putting
[5:04] the barbed wire fence up and doing that
[5:06] yesterday after coming back from the
[5:08] doctor getting free so you know I must
[5:10] be wiggling pretty good and doing all
[5:12] right I still got some tingling but
[5:14] thank God for the whole thing we just
[5:18] appreciate you alright thank you now
[5:21] what we want to do tonight I want to
[5:22] just kind of make this a little
[5:25] instructive message
[5:28] and to make it to me I'm trying to make
[5:30] it to the time element right now all
[5:33] right now we know that we're in a
[5:35] drastic time around the world all right
[5:39] everything's falling apart looks like
[5:42] it's all just going you know and you
[5:45] know the sicknesses and the things that
[5:47] are there and the way that you look at
[5:50] it you think about it
[5:53] something must be going wrong somewhere
[5:55] Iraq
[5:56] so we're I believe we're in the right
[5:58] place now that's my whole point if we
[6:01] don't get nothing for deny get that
[6:04] point I was asked a question the other
[6:05] day kind of you know was my thoughts and
[6:10] what was I thinking you know in in
[6:14] respect of the message and I said I've
[6:17] always been positive
[6:18] I've always felt on that side and I said
[6:21] that's where I am now positive I told my
[6:25] wife on the way up to church today
[6:26] really I don't mean rejoicing because of
[6:30] the bad things don't misunderstand me in
[6:33] our minds don't don't think it I'm
[6:37] trying to say well no I'm not glad for
[6:39] sicknesses I'm not glad for bad economy
[6:41] I'm not bad I'm glad for all of this but
[6:44] we ought to be glad that we know that
[6:49] we've stirred up at least the devil
[6:53] enough to make him want to come down
[6:56] after but now he's not coming after just
[6:57] us he's coming after everybody
[6:59] Darcy can to me I don't believe this is
[7:03] the end of all things in another month
[7:06] or whatever I'm not it may be and if it
[7:09] is praise God all right that's all right
[7:13] there's no problem but we've always been
[7:15] in that basis but uh but I know and I do
[7:17] believe I do believe honestly this is
[7:20] the beginning of the end this is the
[7:23] part that's going to take us on all the
[7:26] way to you know to where we can get out
[7:29] of here and we should rejoice not as I
[7:33] said now don't think I'm saying rejoice
[7:35] because we're bad things going wrong no
[7:38] rejoice because it we're here
[7:41] we're here they were to a point
[7:44] that's why I've always been positive
[7:46] about things and trying to keep it to
[7:49] you as positive you know of where we're
[7:52] at and what we're doing and all like
[7:54] that I've always tried to keep that
[7:55] before all right now and as I said just
[8:00] for a second I'm I'm we know that one
[8:04] day there's going to be a lot of trouble
[8:08] we're promised that in the Bible well
[8:11] are we looking for it as one one one
[8:15] time you know are we looking at it as
[8:17] coming on at different times in
[8:19] different stages I've never looked for
[8:22] it all to dismount up at one time and
[8:24] bound down and it end out in the week
[8:26] and we don't know if I'm wrong I'm wrong
[8:28] on that all right but I've always looked
[8:30] at it as things are gradually going to
[8:33] get worse and worse and worse all right
[8:38] and as it does then it's going to
[8:40] require you and me to be able to follow
[8:44] that day that we're living in follow the
[8:47] time we're at and look at what's taking
[8:50] place around the country was just
[8:52] thinking the other day about something
[8:54] we've listened to the tape and brother
[8:55] Brennan said look at all of this
[8:57] flourishing in the economy you know
[8:59] nothing and how the house is building
[9:02] houses building buildings and building
[9:03] stuff like that well I didn't know that
[9:05] was a sign of the end of the world but
[9:07] that was what he was putting it he was
[9:09] putting it into that basis of the upbeat
[9:12] of the economy well see you think the
[9:15] economy's in bad shape it is but they
[9:18] just made or will make the ruling that
[9:21] you can have zero financing you know
[9:23] what that's far lose some money you know
[9:25] what's gonna do gonna lose some money
[9:27] it's gonna because everybody's waiting
[9:30] on it gets bound when you owned by this
[9:32] they wind up trying to get it for ya all
[9:35] right but now listen to me I believe
[9:40] we're in the end of all things
[9:42] I believe the Bible's right when it says
[9:44] the end of all things has come upon us
[9:46] all right but that was that should not
[9:48] make us afraid we said as I said rejoice
[9:55] rejoice that we are the people that it
[10:00] has been chosen at the end is coming
[10:02] home that's something to me is to think
[10:07] he chose us for the life well you know
[10:09] you can think what you want to know you
[10:12] always say the best of lives you know I
[10:15] mean if I'm eating banana pudding I
[10:17] always try to push a little bit of the
[10:19] kind of juicy with the good bananas that
[10:22] are ripe I I kind of pushed that over in
[10:25] the bow and I'm gonna eat that last
[10:28] because I don't like green bananas
[10:31] I like good juicy dark-looking all right
[10:36] and see that they say rotten but that's
[10:39] all right but now you know I said I'm
[10:43] not a doomsday but I look at things
[10:46] straight
[10:47] do you realize of what has happened in
[10:51] the past two weeks three weeks that
[10:55] you've ever thought about this could be
[10:57] that away or would ever be that away now
[11:01] we always had our idea as I said no they
[11:04] can't do this what I was telling a wife
[11:05] any of my said why don't some of these
[11:07] people just raise up and say how you
[11:09] gonna do it my doors in time I'm gonna
[11:15] keep on running my business somebody is
[11:18] working and pulling some strength well
[11:21] if you don't understand my language that
[11:23] means ever who's in control is now
[11:25] coming into control that's the only
[11:27] thing that I've say to you about
[11:29] anything natural look at the way the
[11:31] world is happening this is all over the
[11:33] world this is not just the United States
[11:37] it's all over the world you say well we
[11:40] we don't know this we don't know that
[11:42] that's the point
[11:44] Oh what are you calling that word
[11:48] propaganda propaganda was used in World
[11:51] War two you know by Hitler them which
[11:53] means sets up a blind set up for this
[11:55] just to get it to where the people don't
[11:57] know what they're doing all right if you
[11:59] don't see that in the world today
[12:01] there's nothing wrong with you one day
[12:02] we got plenty of this the next day we
[12:04] ain't got nothing
[12:05] next day we're back to plenty again we
[12:07] don't know what to do because it's it's
[12:10] all in in to the doings and and and
[12:12] somebody's pulling the strings to make
[12:14] these things work but it's not no
[12:16] problem to me about who's pulling the
[12:18] string cord I know who's doing it it's
[12:21] the devil
[12:21] it's him in his ways he's trying to
[12:24] force his his entire thing upon us to
[12:27] bring us to the basis and our biggest
[12:30] problem is voluntarily doing it he is
[12:35] using it so sly until he's making us
[12:38] really volunteer our own selves to the
[12:43] point you know that we'll do what he
[12:45] says and that's where the danger is that
[12:48] watch the stages of all of the trying to
[12:52] get you to volunteer you know how that
[12:54] is you ought to know you get the phone
[12:56] call today and what does it say send me
[12:59] your telephone number if you don't send
[13:01] me your telephone number within five
[13:02] minutes from now it's gonna I mean your
[13:05] social security number if you don't send
[13:07] it five minutes from now I'm gonna pull
[13:08] into your car to do this that in the
[13:10] fear tactics trying to get you to
[13:13] volunteer what's the best thing to hang
[13:16] up the phone all right when I do I look
[13:19] at the phone I might hang up on some of
[13:22] y'all sometimes because I look at the
[13:23] phone and if it ain't got human numbers
[13:27] you know what I mean but yeah if it's
[13:29] got all these other kind of numbers
[13:30] don't hang it up well you know I'm sorry
[13:33] if I hang up on you but I may do that
[13:36] but not listen see it looking at the
[13:40] world of how it's doing my whole point
[13:42] so you think that what brother Dale's
[13:45] going to give us the downside no no I'm
[13:48] on I'm on the upside you may not
[13:51] understand me in that I know that I know
[13:55] I'm crazy I you know how to tell me but
[13:59] I'm in the upside it's always been that
[14:03] way with me since I come in this message
[14:05] and begin to see that profit and what he
[14:07] was talking about I've never had a
[14:09] downside of me in this message now that
[14:11] a lot of downside to me as human had a
[14:15] lot of problems but not in this message
[14:18] I look forward today by day I pray my
[14:25] prayer is when I'm coming to church here
[14:27] or anywhere that I'm going that prayer
[14:30] is God used that person to not just or
[14:34] today to speak to my heart
[14:36] I'm hungry Lord I'm thirsty for you just
[14:43] let them give me one word and I don't
[14:45] people go sale they'll say I went to a
[14:48] service and I didn't get a thing out of
[14:50] well I've never went to a service I
[14:52] didn't get something out of it because
[14:55] even if they just say Jesus Christ the
[14:57] same yesterday today and forever I'm
[14:59] happy I can agree with them on that the
[15:02] rest might be that I don't agree at all
[15:05] forget I agree to that point of doing
[15:07] that but you see it's not something to
[15:10] look or to the backside it's something
[15:11] to look to to what can be expected if
[15:15] the Bible is right and we just read it
[15:17] don't you believe it it's the enemy when
[15:20] he comes in when the enemy comes in like
[15:24] a flood God's already promised us that
[15:28] he's going to raise up a standard
[15:30] against these things it's not a time to
[15:33] be down and out of the time to be
[15:35] rejoicing because we were the last day
[15:40] people the end of all things has come
[15:44] upon us well but now keep that in mind
[15:50] like I said I you know the message I was
[15:53] gonna bring it's still related to what
[15:55] we've been talking about and to me
[15:57] I'm rejoiced and seeing that the day
[16:01] that we're living is here oh my heart
[16:05] cries to the things that are happening
[16:07] naturally those people around the world
[16:10] of human beings they're not just pieces
[16:13] of dog meat or something throat those
[16:15] are human beings you know they have
[16:19] little babies they love those little
[16:21] babies they're human beings and a bunch
[16:25] of dogs
[16:28] see anybody's a Christian order I would
[16:31] join their heart for others and to help
[16:35] them any way in the world we could and
[16:38] to see how we ought to be willing to
[16:40] because it's meant for you and I to be
[16:43] that way all right now when all of this
[16:46] be coming out to the basis of saying you
[16:51] know and the government as at this
[16:53] moment has not demanded you hear the
[16:56] news new so they're demanding that we do
[16:58] this know they're asking us they're not
[17:04] demanding us when you get a demand you
[17:07] know it when you get a demand somebody
[17:10] most standing on your door and he's
[17:12] gonna be telling you what he wants you
[17:14] to hear or what else you said well you
[17:17] know they can do that any minute now
[17:19] that's but they said brother dick was
[17:22] here he life about I believe was Nixon
[17:24] wouldn't it he said he's gonna declare
[17:26] martial law you know back in his time
[17:29] the guy sitting there with him said he
[17:31] will not do that he said well I'm the
[17:33] president I knew it easier but then
[17:35] people's got guns you know cuz under
[17:38] martial law you have no rule the law is
[17:42] the rule and the law can be whatever the
[17:45] state of Georgia decides you know
[17:48] whatever it is it's the law but you see
[17:51] we're not in that point of a demand
[17:54] we're in a point of asking to volunteer
[18:00] no I had made up my mind was talking
[18:03] about it and meditating what to do and
[18:06] you know and I had made up my mind to
[18:10] comply with the not the law but the
[18:16] request and that we was not going to
[18:20] have a services this coming Sunday I
[18:21] hadn't made up my mind of that and then
[18:23] you notice I didn't it was all put in
[18:25] there and you know
[18:29] and it may come to a time that we have
[18:31] to do on a volunteer but we're going to
[18:35] watch very carefully between the much of
[18:38] a volunteer or a demand they because
[18:46] under volunteer you you do have the
[18:48] right to volunteer about it under demand
[18:51] and it will come to that I wish I told
[18:56] my wife I said I wish I'd have died a
[18:57] long time ago you know I didn't give her
[18:59] those exact words but I said I'd have
[19:01] been happy to died a few years ago you
[19:03] know what I don't have to face all this
[19:05] stuff you know I'm serious I'm serious
[19:09] about it it's been nice but knowing that
[19:12] things are going to take place but let's
[19:16] let them do what they're doing is it any
[19:20] problem we're calling all services this
[19:22] coming Sunday you know we're not going
[19:25] we'll we'll get that and explain it but
[19:27] is there any problem to that no we're
[19:31] doing it because we're volunteering to
[19:34] do it what if the city you was living in
[19:37] or the place you lived around that they
[19:40] was trying to give you some rules about
[19:41] it and you say well they can't room out
[19:43] and then about that time everybody in
[19:45] the community you've got ones up with a
[19:47] disease
[19:48] you'd be tickled to death to try to get
[19:51] somebody on your side and somebody do
[19:53] you know the problems to try to get
[19:55] solved if they can if we could take off
[19:57] from from having services for a month
[20:01] there wouldn't be any problem with me
[20:04] for us to do that because we can do
[20:06] without it we could do without coming
[20:09] here the world is going to go to that
[20:13] system all your searches is setting it
[20:16] up and to make it to the basis that that
[20:18] we can operate and that's not hiding
[20:22] from the government when it comes to the
[20:25] time of that you'll be you'll be in
[20:27] hunted you'll be demand at that point
[20:29] but see what's wrong with say it okay
[20:32] we'll just take off the cup for services
[20:34] maybe that'll take care of it
[20:37] but see our problem is one time now I've
[20:42] been at this for almost 50 years trying
[20:44] to preach to get you to see and I said
[20:47] it in and I'll say it now if we called
[20:53] off Sunday services what are you gonna
[20:58] do
[21:03] well it'd be a good time for me to take
[21:05] the kids - oh you think yeah well yeah
[21:15] not exactly the if we're gonna count it
[21:21] to be a volunteer basis of what we do
[21:24] we'll at least how to be you know the
[21:26] volunteer and I intend to eventually
[21:29] preach on a little bit and and I had
[21:32] already - laid out the point of of
[21:37] asking you say well here listen to these
[21:39] two tapes Sunday one in the morning one
[21:41] evening the unveiling of God and then
[21:45] listen to the mighty guard unveiled and
[21:48] then we'll try to pick up a service and
[21:50] go on with that show and I still wish
[21:52] you would I want you to because we will
[21:55] eventually get to that - the unveiling
[21:58] of God and see what it made and then get
[22:01] to the mighty God unveiled and see what
[22:08] it gets - we will do that because I
[22:10] hadn't made those plans those thoughts
[22:11] and ideas and parts in my mind or that
[22:14] we would be able to do this and do that
[22:17] and you know but we wouldn't be just
[22:22] getting in the car and go riding down to
[22:24] the beach or going down to Walmart you
[22:34] think it ain't serious go right down to
[22:35] commerce we're down there today picking
[22:38] up something we had to for a little
[22:40] spray pump up thing and you can't find
[22:44] no place to go eat now this thing's more
[22:48] serious than we think
[22:49] I mean it's serious for somebody because
[22:57] you think of all the billions of dollars
[22:59] that you lose in every day and now
[23:03] you're saying it's gonna give everybody
[23:04] a thousand dollars of course they say
[23:08] what it is you got to figure out the
[23:09] income tax and we get to new income tax
[23:11] and you're showing you income tax if you
[23:12] spent so much then that takes so much
[23:14] out and you ain't gonna get to hold
[23:15] thousand dollars
[23:16] but that's alright what you see they're
[23:23] doing what they can to try to pull out a
[23:25] natural economy and blaming it on
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] disease in another country you know and
[23:36] and I'm just reading in today's paper
[23:39] they had this lady in Gainesville that
[23:41] she went to three different doctors and
[23:46] each doctor was verifying that she had
[23:50] some things but not enough to qualify
[23:53] her to be tested for this and I can't
[23:55] even pronounce the drug I mean the dizzy
[24:00] see they finally taught it to her and
[24:02] said she was guilty she was tested it's
[24:04] positive well you know I don't my point
[24:07] how long is it been that we could have
[24:09] been positive I've been coughing for
[24:12] forty years I've had a coffin problem
[24:21] for 40 years I could count as being
[24:25] contagious
[24:26] I guess for a lot of things we see we we
[24:31] think oh now this is some kind of plague
[24:34] that Satan has thrown down I was talking
[24:37] about do it as far as I know brother L
[24:40] never did preach preach sermons about
[24:43] the plagues and the vials and things but
[24:45] he did tell about him you know in the
[24:48] message he spoke of them and that he
[24:51] would kind of preach on it later you
[24:52] know but by appointed he never come out
[24:54] and said this is it and this is that
[24:56] because what I was telling him that I
[24:58] think it's in the Book of Revelations it
[25:00] tells about a great catastrophe
[25:02] happening and it names like 10,000
[25:04] people dying in this earthquake or
[25:08] something
[25:13] then you turn around today and reading
[25:15] the newspaper what would it in big old
[25:17] word just who's a kook and say that just
[25:19] Xiaomi
[25:21] [Music]
[25:26] 300,000 people but you don't want that
[25:29] two hundred thousand people what's not
[25:31] what the Bible was talking about the
[25:33] Bible was talking about that ten
[25:34] thousand because it made the point you
[25:37] understand what I mean the Bible's got
[25:39] the answer
[25:41] the Bible has got the point the Prophet
[25:44] told us things to look out for things of
[25:52] how that would come in and take over but
[25:56] we also know that the Bible tells you
[25:58] how it's going to come it's going to
[26:00] come in by what flattery brother Branham
[26:05] in the sealed book says they're waiting
[26:07] on Satan Superman and he says and
[26:09] they're getting him he were talking
[26:11] about the Pope of Rome at that time go
[26:13] read your book see we've been told these
[26:17] things we've known we've talked about it
[26:21] I've stood right here and told you
[26:23] almost fifty years ago and this man over
[26:25] here verifies it you can't come in this
[26:29] city of Lula and put a church without
[26:33] being okayed by the some church
[26:36] association that's already in the city
[26:38] they won't let you and he would insist
[26:40] it matter and he couldn't get it done he
[26:44] had to come under another church under
[26:45] another to be able to come back to do
[26:46] that we've not been blind I've tried to
[26:52] keep you from being this totally blind
[26:55] to see what we're doing on on the other
[26:58] hand are not warning you watch out for
[27:01] these things or if you'd have seen that
[27:05] that happened that time with me
[27:06] when that little black brother stayed
[27:08] over here in the woods and camped out
[27:10] for months and and went to church and
[27:12] everything would come here and he would
[27:14] come to the altar ever service and cry
[27:17] and plead for God to help him and to do
[27:20] things and just you know and apologize
[27:23] for the way his life that he couldn't
[27:26] Bay
[27:26] he couldn't do he was just so great but
[27:30] to show you what God will do I walked up
[27:33] to him one day and I said brother I said
[27:37] something's telling me that you're a
[27:39] government agent they were sent in here
[27:43] to check us out he never moved a muscle
[27:48] frown to smile or nothing
[27:51] he's just student looked at me you know
[27:54] what I told him and I didn't get in my
[27:55] head and holler and spray you know what
[27:56] told him I said do a good job that's it
[28:00] just tell the truth about us don't tell
[28:03] no lies on us just tell the truth about
[28:05] him I followed the man and where he went
[28:09] on down through in the Father in Georgia
[28:11] one day I may meet that man face to face
[28:14] that's no problem I'm just telling you
[28:16] God has told us personally besides what
[28:19] the prophet has told us what to do and
[28:22] what to look for it's not something to
[28:29] come on you know screaming hollering to
[28:31] tell him we ought to be rejoicing that
[28:33] God has thought enough of us to come
[28:35] among us to tell us things to warn us in
[28:42] the future tell us to watch these things
[28:48] what do you say what watch Russia
[28:50] what's Russia well I wish you'd tell me
[28:55] this and I hadn't done everything now I
[28:58] don't check everything I want to read a
[28:59] little bit of the paper tonight but how
[29:03] come Russia's not being said very much
[29:04] about it in this situation you answer
[29:10] that one they haven't been in the paper
[29:11] every day Putin hollering and screaming
[29:13] about this and that and the other in
[29:14] telling us what's going on and the
[29:16] diseases they just been quiet you see
[29:21] Church we could be within this days of
[29:23] bringing all of these things to an end
[29:26] but we could be within years of it
[29:29] that's why we must not tie down to a
[29:31] point and holler and scream and say this
[29:34] is what it is and we're gonna do it
[29:35] different way now then you gonna do it
[29:37] see cuz I thought if I go to the church
[29:40] tell them that we're gonna cancel next
[29:41] Sunday services well I'm just gonna say
[29:43] oh you chicken-hearted coward why don't
[29:45] you stand up for what you believe and
[29:47] come right on and preach it that's what
[29:50] I'm doing exactly what I'm doing
[29:55] it's preaching it you call it chicken
[29:58] harder you tone or whatever we should
[30:00] never in any way have any thoughts in
[30:02] our mind about those four old people of
[30:05] the world today that are dying from all
[30:08] of these diseases need nothing we can do
[30:10] about it but we could pray for them as
[30:12] well as we pray for others just remember
[30:16] one thing because your Christian doesn't
[30:17] make you immune to sickness no matter of
[30:21] fact it opens it up the matter of fact
[30:24] it makes it worse many are the
[30:27] afflictions of the righteous with the
[30:30] Lord lead us out of them all what do you
[30:32] expect it to be you expected to me that
[30:34] no but I know another party goes with it
[30:36] we can pray talking to sister the other
[30:39] day I said we got one option she says
[30:43] what I said one option I said we pray
[30:48] pray for those four old people that are
[30:51] dying from these things
[30:53] brother Prakash invited me come and kept
[30:56] on trying to get me to come and see the
[30:57] brother I couldn't stand it he said well
[31:00] I know you and I know you couldn't I
[31:01] couldn't stand to see all that death and
[31:03] dying on the streets and babies born on
[31:06] the streets and dying on the streets I
[31:08] couldn't I couldn't take it what a
[31:10] little bit I've seen in the world it's
[31:13] been bad enough but listen we should be
[31:17] happy about these things and see it is
[31:19] like I said it and my plans was what's
[31:22] to do it what's traditionally okay you
[31:25] can think what you want to about me -
[31:27] we're gonna comply with the government
[31:28] we're not going to to buckle down to
[31:32] government we're going one week at a
[31:35] time or one day at a time when they come
[31:39] and tell me that I can't preach the
[31:42] truth you'll hear it it may be the last
[31:47] one but you hear it
[31:50] that's why I'm saying this hasn't turned
[31:53] out to be a religious situation yet it's
[31:56] a natural situation but if to me it's
[32:00] exactly like all the others
[32:02] it's to see what you can do with the
[32:04] people of the world to me that's what
[32:07] they're doing there's being how where
[32:10] you'll stand for what you believe or not
[32:18] but listen I was planning on this
[32:22] canceling the service for the weekend
[32:26] but I began to think about it that's all
[32:32] right we can get around outlines and
[32:36] still it doesn't bother me as far as
[32:38] what I'm saying now listen to what I'm
[32:40] saying all right we will not have a
[32:44] Sunday service in this building Sunday
[32:49] now I said a service I didn't say we
[32:53] wouldn't be here preaching and send it
[32:56] out because that's one option that we
[32:58] still have so you may have to listen to
[33:02] internet for a week or two because she
[33:07] church this may be the fact not a just
[33:09] the end of the world but it may be the
[33:11] fact and all of these things the
[33:14] government's doing the best they can do
[33:16] and if somebody ain't doing if you tell
[33:19] me what's going on when they can just
[33:21] close out a whole government
[33:24] like clothes they've closed everything
[33:26] down look at the millions of billions of
[33:29] dollars that's being lost every day look
[33:33] at just these sports events that they've
[33:39] had to cancel because they afraid it'll
[33:43] get started will you realize we may have
[33:46] a hundred people in America with a
[33:47] disease but if that's good starting it
[33:50] can spread all over you said well you
[33:58] don't talk like a Christian I'm talking
[34:00] like what I think a Christian really is
[34:01] a Christian should be one that would be
[34:03] concerned about everybody in the world
[34:07] to be praying and thinking about these
[34:10] things three that's a Christian you know
[34:14] what I get I can holler oh the devil
[34:16] doing it now boy that that that
[34:18] Antichrist is coming down and takes you
[34:19] to see them riding here can't you see
[34:21] them riding there you don't even know
[34:25] what the antichrist is but listen well
[34:33] what we're gonna plan to do is plan to
[34:36] just have the minister being here and
[34:42] type the service put it on internet
[34:45] they'll be up to you to listen and it is
[34:48] mandatory that I'll make it disappear
[34:52] eight right on all things all who come
[34:55] in helping the services we'll do it on a
[34:57] volunteer basis if you don't want to
[35:00] volunteer to come and help us do what
[35:01] little bit we have to do here to get it
[35:03] out because they're even saying now that
[35:05] they're gonna start riding by churches
[35:07] and places and take it down how many
[35:09] cars are they can do that really easy
[35:12] they can do all kind of things so we
[35:14] just try our best to just float with
[35:16] them go with them as what we can do
[35:19] let's see what if the Bible says now you
[35:21] may differ with McCarter's in the
[35:23] Beatitudes but it does how does that
[35:26] state that
[35:28] come on and flipped in my mind it's
[35:32] talking about in the Beatitudes you know
[35:34] be your attitude but then it automatic
[35:37] said all that wants to push it a little
[35:39] uncertain that says agree with your
[35:40] adversary quickly right unless he take
[35:46] you to the law and you not be able to
[35:50] come out well is that God telling you to
[35:55] agree with your adversary to the point
[35:58] of your adversary senator Trinity so
[36:01] we've got to agree with the law if that
[36:02] is the Trinity we saved the Trinity now
[36:05] come on I'm gonna take a few minutes to
[36:06] say something I'll remember what Martin
[36:11] Luther said he said we'll do everything
[36:14] we can we'll we'll do everything we will
[36:18] not in any way harm or try to stop this
[36:20] or anything but let me ask you a
[36:23] question
[36:24] that was natural things he was doing
[36:26] because of a natural disaster that was
[36:28] going on in his land did he go that day
[36:31] and preach against the Catholic Church
[36:33] I'd say he did wouldn't you wouldn't you
[36:39] think he went on over and preached
[36:40] against the Catholic Chur that furry day
[36:42] that he was uh power standing up for
[36:44] people and declaring that he was going
[36:47] to try to help them and do the best that
[36:48] he could do because he's human
[36:52] we're not giving in to the devil
[36:55] we just used him what's wrong with using
[37:00] him you gave us the Internet we're
[37:04] sending that we can touch the world with
[37:07] these messages the world now around the
[37:11] world has heard the Word of God
[37:14] listen you realize that brother Branham
[37:17] the Smashing it's being on the Internet
[37:19] the world has heard that message
[37:25] what a glorious day what a glorious time
[37:31] when I asked her brother I said you
[37:33] think your dad ever thought that his
[37:37] message would go around the world on a
[37:41] little bit ik player that you could plug
[37:44] up out in their jungles and get a solar
[37:48] power and brother branham kinases could
[37:50] go for it all the world he said I don't
[37:54] know do you think about it this message
[37:59] has went around the world what if the
[38:01] Bible say about paraphrasing but what if
[38:05] there's some about when it gets to that
[38:06] point that it's reach the world then I'm
[38:16] in a few days I'm gonna be 80 years old
[38:20] I'm gonna having this juice for coffee
[38:23] you know I hope innate to call fen wrong
[38:27] way to spell that word but I'm just
[38:34] serious about a church are we facing
[38:37] these things in the right order to see
[38:40] what we would do or where we're at we're
[38:42] not guaranteed that disease is denied
[38:45] it's not a great thing put over us now
[38:48] wait a minute you said I quote run
[38:50] around and will quote like what we use
[38:51] so go ahead now so you're running the
[38:53] ground do it both ways we do have a
[38:58] covering over us that keeps us safe in
[39:03] the time of sickness so don't
[39:06] misunderstand my words are saying it but
[39:08] you know at the same time we can be sick
[39:12] the same Lord Jesus that was the god of
[39:15] the healer you know he was the healer
[39:18] himself who's sick think get it right he
[39:26] put it in the right order we put it in
[39:28] our to be happy about it and get it to
[39:30] where we can look down and see hey we're
[39:33] to end
[39:38] we're to end of this name if it's
[39:42] another 20 years what a lot
[39:44] it's another hundred years all right so
[39:46] what sister pleat I'm now gonna be
[39:48] getting pretty old what the town
[39:49] whatever yeah we'll make it we made it
[39:54] so far I thank God every day for my help
[40:00] [Music]
[40:04] talking they came in there I said and
[40:06] the nurse basically to the nurses over
[40:09] here doing the shoulder and Hassan I
[40:12] said do you realize and I'm nearly 80
[40:16] years old and I said I've had one
[40:19] operation now had gum surgery you don't
[40:23] have to be cut and pull the tooth out or
[40:25] sort of I'm not about something they
[40:28] could hand out right there I've never
[40:30] been offered never had no broken bones
[40:32] never hadn't it you think I don't value
[40:34] God in his healing but I like what
[40:39] brother John Martin said about it one
[40:40] time he said we don't have to wait do we
[40:42] get sick to pray you know I've pretty
[40:45] well the way we are right well pray for
[40:47] me I'm sick well why didn't you pray
[40:49] yesterday for you got sick there's no
[40:55] one another day no your silly not sadly
[40:57] but it's true I don't have to wait I get
[41:01] thank you for healing me and me not even
[41:03] sick well I ain't none eating me praying
[41:05] like that away well let's go ahead you
[41:08] don't understand what I'm talking about
[41:10] I'm talking about it all knowing God
[41:13] that he's taking care of his bride
[41:18] covering his bride with a blood but at
[41:22] the same time we're human beings that
[41:25] have sicknesses and heartaches and
[41:27] troubles no because we're human beings
[41:31] uh-huh do you see what we're gonna do
[41:33] we're just gonna switch things around a
[41:35] little black and we'll have Sunday
[41:37] services you can be able to view it at
[41:38] home
[41:39] on your internet and to you that don't
[41:42] have the internet we will copy the
[41:45] services back you're on the other the
[41:48] mp3 or in what you call it part of it
[41:51] and you can listen to the services we're
[41:53] not going nobody's going to be cut out
[41:55] it will be left for everybody
[41:57] what's that way we can be saying if the
[41:59] government comes along say look what hey
[42:01] what you we're doing what you say then
[42:05] when they say you can't do that we may
[42:10] have to argue with them that's all right
[42:17] so just remember the internet service
[42:20] will be doing that waiting and I'll take
[42:22] probably the morning service way to take
[42:24] the evening service will have the the
[42:26] Internet services and it'll be just like
[42:27] you're sitting here thank God for the
[42:31] ability we have the ability to bypass
[42:35] all of these things Satan and all these
[42:37] smartness he just messed up and putting
[42:39] it in wrong hands now we can do what we
[42:42] need to do with it and do it Church do
[42:44] you understand what I'm talking about
[42:46] see I'm trying to get you to see that
[42:50] this is a worldwide event this is this
[42:54] not a whole county situation and a
[42:59] worldwide event of sickness all over the
[43:02] world of one thing sure we know that
[43:07] we've had those diseases in time but
[43:09] it's like I was trying to tell you not
[43:10] about the swine flu of what Obama's day
[43:14] but dwelling back they had a time back
[43:17] Thursday loss I forgot how many millions
[43:20] and millions of people in one thing are
[43:22] in we're brother Quinn comes from they
[43:25] they died from a potato blight and just
[43:29] died all over well you compare a hundred
[43:35] years ago and if you lost a hundred
[43:38] million people but you compare that with
[43:42] today when you only had maybe one
[43:44] billion back then now you have seven to
[43:48] ten billion people
[43:51] if you lost a billion people to one of
[43:53] these desert and German yeah that
[43:56] wouldn't even be a hardhead dropping the
[43:57] bucket me and see this is the odd thing
[44:03] to me that it stood it's it's not just
[44:05] one cup place it's all over it's all
[44:08] over the world it's gaining well it's
[44:13] either one or two things something
[44:15] man-made has brought these things to
[44:18] pass or it is some of the flags and
[44:22] things of the Bible that are speaking of
[44:24] either way it's the same situation the
[44:26] same the end to it we don't throw up her
[44:31] hands and quit I didn't come into this
[44:35] to quit they didn't scare me when they
[44:39] said well we're gonna do the code it
[44:41] just kept coming more and more and more
[44:42] that didn't scare me this for them to
[44:44] say that we want you to do this Nana
[44:48] knowing that eventually they can demand
[44:50] you sold nowhere in America hey I got a
[44:55] bunch of stock and Brooklyn Bridge I
[44:57] want to sell it are you dumb enough to
[45:00] buy it you say what do you mean that's
[45:02] what I mean by our dumbness don't think
[45:04] we're in America don't think we're in
[45:07] America protected by American laws we
[45:10] have no American laws the law ain't
[45:17] gonna help you it's gonna help the one
[45:21] that tells what to do and they can take
[45:25] that and use it I I do believe this is
[45:28] the beginning of the final end of
[45:30] pushing how long he's got to do it we'll
[45:35] be here hundred years if I live that
[45:39] long I pray God I still had enough force
[45:41] if I can live to be that old without
[45:43] having a voice to still scream out and
[45:44] say Jesus Christ is here living in the
[45:48] hearts of the people getting us ready to
[45:51] get out of this situation and that he
[45:55] will bring us through
[45:59] why because he promised it I'd rather
[46:06] have God's promises than everything else
[46:08] you can give me just give me his
[46:11] promises he promised it promised us all
[46:17] of these things I don't consider this to
[46:20] be the end of the world it could be I
[46:26] repeat I will try my best to help do
[46:31] anything I can to try to help anything
[46:34] if somebody come in this building sick I
[46:36] would do the best I could to help those
[46:40] people I made myself clear back yonder
[46:44] or said it but it was too clear I guess
[46:46] and I I won't just make that statement
[46:48] right now what I'm doing I've left it
[46:50] back under years ago and made a
[46:52] statement I said if you're sick come on
[46:54] the church well you know kind of got
[46:59] mixed up a little bit the code I never
[47:03] meant if you got 105 degree temperature
[47:05] come to church but I do say it like this
[47:09] if you've got a 110 degree temperature
[47:13] call us up I'll meet you anywhere in any
[47:17] of this building or whatever and I'll go
[47:19] pray with you about that child or a
[47:21] person or whatever I would not back down
[47:23] from that because there's some sickness
[47:25] to think it would be upon me no because
[47:31] I want to help you you have a sickness
[47:37] call us let us know and say I'm on the
[47:41] way to church told him our home one time
[47:45] and we was taking the kids to I think it
[47:49] was a time Wade we cured him with the
[47:51] doctor I'm not certain but anyhow we
[47:53] wound up and I said where you going I
[47:55] said well we're going to church and pray
[47:56] and then we're going to the doctor
[47:58] that's what life is
[48:00] well if you're going to pray why are you
[48:02] going to call them sick is any problem
[48:09] you know is anything wrong with the fact
[48:15] that you've been sick and a half's for
[48:18] the doctor to help you you might wind up
[48:22] like we did with wait one time when
[48:24] acuity man had bad tonsil things and it
[48:25] was just old man and he'd run 105
[48:27] degrees and brother Tatum unless we took
[48:30] him to the doctor called him that was in
[48:32] days that the doctored meets his office
[48:33] you know and their old doctor come in
[48:35] and about the time he opened he opened
[48:38] the door for us to walk in here comes
[48:40] Wade and he was at that high temperature
[48:42] and he just plastered that whole
[48:46] building inside vomiting you know what
[48:52] the doctors say he's taking back home
[48:54] he'll be all right now and just like a
[48:57] doctor at least let us do something you
[49:00] know or let us pay for for all that he
[49:02] said I've got a cleaner for that yeah
[49:08] what you see we think a lot of times
[49:10] sicknesses you know you thought you
[49:13] listen to brother Brown and when he said
[49:14] said look at that job he said yeah that
[49:15] old Damon said he's getting it out of
[49:17] there what you see we look at things in
[49:22] in the wrong direction and and that's
[49:24] what I'm saying and trying to get us
[49:25] there not do in this is to not look at
[49:28] it in the wrong direction to think hey
[49:29] the end is here and what do we do I'm
[49:31] scared I'm scared we'll get it out rid
[49:33] of that get rid of the fear that's the
[49:36] point of preaching reason instead of
[49:39] this board over and telling if I'm
[49:40] preaching through one thing what when
[49:43] the enemy comes in like a flood God will
[49:45] raise up a standard
[49:46] so let's believe in him and keep calling
[49:50] upon him to help us and goddess why
[49:54] can't we can you be happy when you're
[49:56] sick I just got out of there we'd left
[50:02] the Baptist Church and I had a real bad
[50:04] sickness and the brother used to go to
[50:08] church our Withers he he come to see me
[50:10] and we got sitting there talking and I
[50:12] mean then I was I said wait a little bit
[50:16] I got talking and I got out of that you
[50:18] know and I got to talking to him about
[50:20] the Lord and all he said
[50:22] I thought you see well see I got on the
[50:27] different side I got over on the side of
[50:30] the healer and I was being happy about
[50:33] it
[50:34] he didn't matter how much I had to say I
[50:36] sick I'm glad to talk to him about the
[50:38] Lord do you understand what I'm trying
[50:41] to get it we should be happy instead of
[50:44] anything to think about being down and
[50:45] out but as I said one ago who do we do
[50:51] now what are you gonna do we're gonna
[50:53] have maybe Sunday you have an
[50:54] opportunity what are you gonna do so
[50:59] you're gonna prove what you are oh
[51:03] brother Dale don't talk like that we're
[51:09] gonna prove what we are well let's see
[51:14] what takes place you get an opportunity
[51:18] to not have to come to church you're
[51:20] signed out everything's okay you'll not
[51:24] be doctored and all but what we do with
[51:31] the rest is gonna prove a lot of things
[51:38] see I want to do everything I I would go
[51:40] right now that would be no problem with
[51:41] me and you know me well enough know if I
[51:44] say it I mean it I'd go to these
[51:46] countries right now it wouldn't be
[51:47] bothering me whatsoever
[51:49] to just leave and go if I could help
[51:51] them I knew I could do something to help
[51:55] them because that's poor old human
[51:56] beings they pray that God will will
[52:03] remove these things whatever it is he'll
[52:07] get it over with
[52:08] and he'll finish it up or whatever the
[52:11] plague is or whatever the thing if he's
[52:13] browning or if it's the devil to
[52:14] bringing it whatever dish what pray that
[52:17] God will get it all worked out and and
[52:19] get it into the right order and we'll be
[52:22] praying for other people
[52:23] you mean you preferably what's the
[52:25] problem
[52:27] what's the trouble why can't you pray
[52:30] for somebody else you mean you wouldn't
[52:38] pray for the Pope of Rome I prize me on
[52:43] this quick as I would anybody else
[52:46] because he's a human being
[52:50] that's where we've got the idea we I say
[52:55] we've the message people's got the idea
[52:57] that we are a special set aside group
[53:00] and none of these things is supposed to
[53:02] be bothering us hey many are the
[53:09] afflictions of the righteous but the
[53:12] Lord lead us out of them all we sat down
[53:17] lazily and just accept what he's doing
[53:20] hey I'm fighting I don't go down like I
[53:23] said I went to the doctor there Nate the
[53:27] operate on my shoulder you know come out
[53:29] and give me a good clean bill of health
[53:31] out of everything and say what they had
[53:32] done well I didn't go home and lay down
[53:37] I got laid long enough I was tired I was
[53:41] tired from laying I'd get up late on I
[53:44] go to bed I get up in lay down
[53:49] but I thank God I took one pain pill I
[53:53] didn't need it I didn't need it never
[53:59] took them all you said would you hurt a
[54:02] little bit
[54:05] that's the core than what you called a
[54:07] little bit because yesterday afternoon I
[54:11] just is so tired to do and I said mama
[54:14] waited Benny what it took us and we
[54:17] hadn't been to the bank you know under
[54:18] doing the thing that I said let's go to
[54:21] buy new some bank and get out I didn't
[54:23] intend to go walking through Walmart
[54:25] because that's my point of what I'm
[54:27] saying we say oh we're sitting you know
[54:30] we're this way we're going to Walmart
[54:31] well no no you might go to Walmart and
[54:34] get what you want and it might not be in
[54:36] a bag but I told her I said let's go she
[54:43] said you want to get out of here so when
[54:46] I got back I got a change I had to sneak
[54:48] around a little bit cuz she's sitting in
[54:49] the window watch it try sneak out and I
[54:53] get my flourish and we're putting some
[54:55] barbed wire on the inside of a wooden
[54:57] fence and they go strong bla bla I gotta
[55:01] work with that with my wire up it went a
[55:03] little high here come the other floor
[55:05] what are you doing over here I'm working
[55:11] that's just me I can't lay down and I
[55:17] certainly ain't gonna lay down in the
[55:18] gospel I'm gonna stand in the fight for
[55:21] everything Oh God
[55:23] that's what we all should do praise God
[55:28] for what He has given us do you thank
[55:31] him for the word that you've heard I do
[55:33] every day I walk through the house and
[55:35] lord thank you you could reveal this to
[55:39] somebody apples you could reveal this to
[55:45] somebody else they could be and I do
[55:48] yeah I'm beginning to reveal it to
[55:50] somebody I don't into my eyes me either
[55:56] I want him to open that word to her that
[55:58] I can see and what am I going to see
[56:02] when I opened the word the prophet said
[56:05] when the bride realizes what she's here
[56:08] for I'm paraphrasing it you know he said
[56:10] she'll be an invincible army you said
[56:15] well we're not an investment well then
[56:16] we're not doing that correctly we're not
[56:20] facing it with an attitude of hey not
[56:22] that I'm sick
[56:24] help me I'm sick ain't nothing wrong
[56:27] being sick now when you sick you're sick
[56:29] but now when you make yourself sick you
[56:36] know yourself you call me up anytime you
[56:38] want to what does it say it how you
[56:39] doing brother day off wonderful I'm
[56:43] dying I'm laying you're hurting like
[56:46] everything I'm feeling wonderful because
[56:51] I'm in Christ Jesus I've got an
[56:53] opportunity to see God move in
[56:56] mysterious ways
[56:58] and to see things take place what would
[57:02] not be happy you understand I hope you
[57:08] get what I'm talking about I hope you

[57:12] bring to say and not trying to do to say
