[1:20] of testify about
[1:22] two or three weeks ago we had been

[1:27] expressway
[1:29] this guy an 18 wheeler
[1:32] just turned
[1:33] right across in front of me
[1:35] and all i could do was just stop that
[1:38] time i said well you know after i
[1:39] stopped and took off
[1:41] it really didn't upset me scared after
[1:44] death but didn't upset me i said well
[1:46] you know i thank the lord
[1:48] that he was safe
[1:50] and i will say
[1:51] and so
[1:52] i forgot about it
[1:54] pretty quickly you know if you
[1:57] go into a rage it takes a long time
[2:00] to shake that rage off
[2:02] but if you thank the lord for what
[2:04] happened you know the safe part of it
[2:06] you're so much better off for it that's
[2:08] right amen that's right and what else i
[2:10] want to ask y'all i'm gonna keep it too
[2:11] long
[2:12] uh
[2:13] i just read the message
[2:17] spiritual food in due season
[2:19] it's a great message it's a short
[2:21] message
[2:22] you ought to read it when you get time
[2:24] amen let's pray
[2:27] heavenly father we are grateful and
[2:28] we're thankful for this day but we thank
[2:31] for all the blessings god that you have
[2:33] restored upon us
[2:35] lord for their many failures lord and
[2:37] errors that we make in life
[2:39] love you will forgive us from all lords
[2:41] we will come to you lord and ask you for
[2:44] your blessings
[2:45] lord we ask you each one that is present
[2:47] this morning god that you would touch
[2:49] their hearts and soul
[2:50] lord grant unto him lord that which they
[2:52] have need of lord you said if we would
[2:54] believe that you were granted unto us
[2:56] god and we ask you to be your way bless
[2:59] the services bless this reading and
[3:01] bless the oncoming services in jesus
[3:03] christ and we pray amen
[3:06] to read hebrews 12
[3:10] hebrews 12 1 through 15.
[3:14] okay
[3:16] wherefore seeing we all saw our
[3:18] compassion about was so great a cloud of
[3:20] witness let us lay aside every weight
[3:23] and the sin which does
[3:26] so easily beset us and let us run with
[3:29] patience the race that is set before
[3:44] at the right us of the throne of god
[3:48] for considering him that endureth much
[3:50] contradiction of sinners against himself
[3:54] lest ye be
[3:55] weary and faint in your minds
[4:05] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[4:08] which speaketh
[4:10] unto you as unto children my son
[4:13] despise not thou the chesting of the
[4:16] lord
[4:17] not faint
[4:18] when thou art rebuked of him
[4:29] if you endure chasing god deals with you
[4:33] as with son for what son is he whom the
[4:37] father chastens not
[4:49] furthermore we
[4:51] have had fathers of our flesh which
[4:53] corrected us and
[4:56] we gave them reverence
[4:59] shall not
[5:01] we
[5:02] much rather be in subjection unto the
[5:05] father of spirits and life
[5:20] now no chastening for the presence seems
[5:22] to be joyous
[5:24] but grievous nevertheless afterwards it
[5:27] yieldeth
[5:28] the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto
[5:31] them which are
[5:33] exercised thereby
[5:42] and make straight paths for your feet
[5:45] lest that which is lame be turned out of
[5:48] the way but let it rather be healed
[5:59] looking deadly lest any man feel of the
[6:03] grace of god
[6:04] lest any root or business spring of
[6:07] trouble for you
[6:09] and thereby men and be defiled amen god
[6:13] bless you be seated thank you

[15:34] me
[15:57] good morning good to see each and every
[15:58] one of you again
[16:00] been a while it's been kind of a rough
[16:01] year for me physically
[16:03] i've had a couple of bouts in the
[16:05] hospital and
[16:07] just the devil's mad at us that's all i
[16:09] can say
[16:10] you know brother ham said every gun
[16:12] every devil in hell their guns are aimed
[16:14] at this bride
[16:16] and so uh
[16:18] me and brother wade i thought it was
[16:19] kind of comical we went by this baptist
[16:21] church up here on the way here
[16:23] and uh i told brother wade i said man
[16:26] they got it made
[16:27] you know they really do because every
[16:29] devil in hell is aimed at us right i'm
[16:31] trying to no matter what you try to do
[16:33] the devil's there to try to to cut your
[16:35] wheels off your wagon like brother
[16:37] branham said so
[16:39] i look at them and sometimes i say boy
[16:40] they got it easy but you know it's it's
[16:42] just our reasonable services all it is
[16:45] when you look and see what he's done for
[16:46] us it's just this is just small
[16:49] what we do
[16:50] as part of this but
[16:52] uh
[16:54] like i said last time i've been kind on
[16:55] a series but i've kind of been a series
[16:58] but a sub series and i started out with
[17:00] cod
[17:01] i really believe that you know brother
[17:02] roy borders put the c.o.d book together
[17:05] and the first thing that we understand
[17:07] is called cod conduct order and doctrine
[17:10] and i believe if you're going to be the
[17:11] bride of jesus christ i think you're
[17:13] going to have all those things
[17:15] i believe your conduct is going to be
[17:16] correct i believe your order you know
[17:19] the opposite of order is chaos
[17:21] and so i believe we're going to be
[17:23] orderly as the bride and i believe we're
[17:25] going to have the right doctrine i
[17:26] really believe that i believe our
[17:28] doctrine is going to line up with the
[17:30] bible
[17:31] and i think if you've got all those
[17:33] things lined up i think your bride right
[17:35] but if i think you get any one of those
[17:36] out of order i don't think you're right
[17:39] i really don't you may call yourself
[17:41] bride but i don't believe your bride
[17:42] unless you get everything put together
[17:45] and so i went through the church and i
[17:46] discussed the conduct sometimes you you
[17:49] know i've heard preachers say well we
[17:50] don't need the clothesline preaching
[17:52] around here i've looked around our
[17:53] congregation and yes they do
[17:55] it's part of it you know in the old
[17:57] testament
[17:59] uh under moses is a part of you know the
[18:01] book of redemption exodus joshua that
[18:04] high priest had to be addressed a
[18:06] certain way to go into the holy of
[18:07] holies
[18:08] you know we're kings and priests and
[18:10] we've got to be dressed a certain way to
[18:11] go in there
[18:13] and so you got to be careful how you
[18:15] approach god you really do god's got an
[18:17] order to it conduct to it and we have a
[18:19] doctrine in this hour
[18:21] and if those things please god i believe
[18:24] you're bright i really do
[18:25] but i uh since i've been here last time
[18:28] i kind of uh went and i preached on the
[18:30] book of life
[18:31] i preached i don't know how many parts
[18:33] on that and really broke it down for the
[18:34] people and i'm kind of like brother uh
[18:36] brother samuel i it's hard for me to get
[18:39] everything in one service
[18:40] i'm kind of like brother branham he said
[18:42] he was numb he was numb-minded you know
[18:44] your prophet said that
[18:46] brother brown was numb-minded he wasn't
[18:48] educated he had a seventh grade
[18:49] education of course i got more in that
[18:51] education but i'm still numb-minded i
[18:54] will tell you that
[18:55] and so it takes us a while to get these
[18:56] things out and i tell the church it's
[18:58] kind of like my wife's here is real long
[19:00] and i always like to watch her braid it
[19:02] and all that you know comb it out in the
[19:05] morning and she doesn't just comb it out
[19:06] once
[19:07] she'll comb the outside of it she combs
[19:09] the inside of it and she comes back
[19:11] through all of it and so i said that's
[19:13] kind of what i am as a pastor i kind of
[19:15] comb through this thing this message and
[19:17] i'm going to get all the tangles out
[19:18] what i don't understand
[19:20] until this thing gets real nice and
[19:22] that's
[19:23] kind of what the ministry is doing now
[19:24] we're going back through kind of going
[19:26] through it and trying to get everything
[19:28] you know lined up with the word is
[19:30] really what it is
[19:32] but preached on the book of life and i i
[19:35] feel like this is just me i don't think
[19:37] you can really understand the book of
[19:39] redemption without understanding the
[19:40] book of life
[19:42] you know brother brahman one statement
[19:44] under the when brother branham was
[19:45] preaching on the seals he said now we
[19:47] understand
[19:49] the truth on serpent seed he preached
[19:52] serpenty in 1959
[19:55] but you know what i really think started
[19:56] clearing up the book of life to him
[19:59] that's really what i think and by that
[20:02] then then serpency could be cleared up
[20:05] when you understand book of life if you
[20:07] don't understand the book of life you'll
[20:08] never get
[20:09] uh serpent seed and the different
[20:11] segments of uh you know there's the
[20:13] church there's the bride there's 144
[20:16] thousand right so you know we need to
[20:18] understand all these things and we live
[20:20] in an hour where we do understand these
[20:22] things it's a wonderful hour it really
[20:25] is
[20:25] so uh
[20:27] anyway so after that i got to thinking i
[20:29] thought well what really is the book of
[20:31] redemption
[20:32] you know we say it and we know brother
[20:34] brown said it so i said i'm going to go
[20:36] back i want to look i want to explain to
[20:38] the people
[20:39] exactly what the book of redemption is
[20:41] and so that's what i did so
[20:43] um
[20:45] i want to read some scriptures here i
[20:46] don't know if he's got it on there yet
[20:47] but i want to go to hebrews 11 and 1.
[20:50] sorry to leave you standing i don't mean
[20:51] to do that
[20:52] i'm not like jewel brother jewel forney
[20:54] he's the helicopter preacher he goes
[20:56] straight up makes his trip and comes
[20:58] down i go real slow to get there then
[21:01] i'll hit it then i'll come down okay
[21:03] so that's just kind of the way i am but
[21:05] i want to read hebrews
[21:07] 11 and 1 here in 1 and 2.
[21:11] it says now faith is the substance of
[21:13] things hoped for the evidence of things
[21:16] not seen
[21:17] for by it the elders take obtained a
[21:20] good report right i almost get down to
[21:21] hebrews 11 6
[21:24] but without sin is impossible to please
[21:26] him it's absolutely impossible to please
[21:30] god without faith
[21:32] for he that cometh to god must believe
[21:34] that he is is the i am today
[21:38] he is his present tense is that right
[21:40] you have to believe he is
[21:43] okay and that he is a rewarder of them
[21:46] that diligently seek him is that right
[21:49] let's bow our heads if you would dear
[21:51] heavenly father we thank you for the
[21:53] reading of the word we pray that you'll
[21:54] give the church here this morning here
[21:56] to hear what the spirit saith oh father
[21:58] and lord just be with me let me get
[22:00] myself out of the way may you minister
[22:03] this great subject to the book of
[22:04] redemption oh father and we ask these
[22:06] things in jesus christ's name
[22:08] amen you may be seated i want to go back
[22:11] what i did was at our church i thought
[22:14] well i went through literally and i
[22:16] looked at every quote where brother ram
[22:17] talked about the book of redemption
[22:19] and then i thought okay what books in
[22:22] the bible did brother branham refer to
[22:25] as the book of redemption
[22:27] and if you go out on the internet and
[22:28] you do a retrieval
[22:30] all the people all the preachers before
[22:32] our prophet william branham when they
[22:34] talked about the book of redemption
[22:35] they'll point to exodus
[22:37] they'll say exodus the book of
[22:38] redemption okay always that's what they
[22:41] point to but brother branham through the
[22:43] message i looked at i said okay
[22:46] what books did he refer to as the book
[22:49] of redemption okay the first one of
[22:51] course is exodus in excellence you look
[22:54] anywhere it says the book of redemption
[22:56] everybody understands that redemption
[22:58] has two parts
[22:59] redemption is out of and into
[23:02] so if you've came out of the world and
[23:03] the things the world but you haven't got
[23:05] all the way through your trip then
[23:07] you're just not finished yet okay and
[23:10] quite honestly our trip in this hour is
[23:12] a new body
[23:13] so this thing is not finished until you
[23:16] get a glorified body
[23:18] i'm going to be honest with you you
[23:19] think well i got the baptism of the holy
[23:21] ghost that's it well you're sealed in
[23:24] but you need to get a new body
[23:25] and one thing i've understood about the
[23:27] baptism in the holy ghost there's a lot
[23:28] of people say well you got the baptism
[23:30] holy ghost you're just you won't make
[23:31] any more mistakes that's not what your
[23:33] prophet said
[23:35] he said you'll be sticky all the way
[23:36] through
[23:37] as long as you've got this body you're
[23:38] subject to mistakes
[23:40] brother branham said in the message he
[23:42] said moses was a failure
[23:45] sure do you know brother ham said that
[23:48] i'm gonna really shock you brother
[23:50] branham was a failure
[23:52] he was a man we all failed
[23:54] i'm a failure your pastor's a failure
[23:57] your assistant pastor you are a failure
[24:00] at best your best day you're a failure
[24:03] because remember what he said to abraham
[24:05] abraham it's not what you've done
[24:07] it's what i've done for you
[24:09] and that's the revelation we need to
[24:11] have in this hour it's not what you do
[24:14] it's what god's done for you
[24:16] now that's the real truth of it okay
[24:18] so in the in exodus it's a it's a book
[24:21] of redemption
[24:22] and brother adam also referred to joshua
[24:24] as a book of redemption did you know
[24:26] that
[24:27] and and of course joshua means jehovah
[24:29] savior
[24:30] and in joshua what they were doing was
[24:32] positionally placing the jews
[24:35] exactly where they would go in the
[24:36] promised land is that right
[24:39] so a part of your redemption is to
[24:41] positionally place you where you need to
[24:42] be
[24:44] right so you get into the promised land
[24:46] but there's a positioning once you get
[24:48] there we know that's adoption we all
[24:50] understand that right then brother
[24:52] branham talked about ruth he said ruth
[24:55] was an absolute perfect type of
[24:57] redemption
[24:59] is what brother branham said of course
[25:01] we understand brother branham preached
[25:02] the four parts in ruth first part was
[25:05] deciding
[25:06] does anybody know that deciding or a
[25:08] decision is justification
[25:10] your justification is you have decided
[25:13] to take a certain route
[25:16] does everybody understand that do you
[25:17] know they're out there there's churches
[25:19] 969 churches in 1960 there's ways right
[25:24] do you know the highway that you picked
[25:26] for me to come here was it a
[25:28] decision i made
[25:30] does everybody understand that
[25:31] you understand the the servant in the
[25:33] bible talks about servant you remember
[25:35] first pool second full third pool it
[25:37] said go into the highways and the hedges
[25:40] do you know what he went into brother
[25:42] brandon went into the denominations and
[25:44] sucked the life out of them
[25:46] that's what the high that what is a
[25:47] highway it's a decision you make to get
[25:49] from point a to point b
[25:51] to get to atlanta there's more than one
[25:53] highway is there not
[25:55] and that's the way it is we look at the
[25:57] christian world they say well there's
[25:59] more than one way
[26:00] right
[26:01] but we understand it's a highway to
[26:03] heaven
[26:04] is that right one lord one faith one
[26:08] baptism
[26:09] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[26:12] the life
[26:13] so the way that you take is a decision
[26:16] that you make
[26:17] you have to you made a decision this
[26:19] morning to come to this church
[26:21] god will never take that away from you
[26:22] your free moral agency so justification
[26:25] is deciding
[26:26] and then serving is sanctification is
[26:29] that right
[26:30] that you're going to serve him and the
[26:32] third part is resting
[26:34] is that right remember ruth she just was
[26:36] sitting in the house resting
[26:38] while
[26:40] while boaz did the work of the kinsmen
[26:42] redeemer she was resting is that right
[26:45] he was it was he was the one doing it
[26:47] all she just had to rest at that point
[26:50] and then after that she was rewarded is
[26:52] that right so ruth is a wonderful type
[26:55] of redemption perfect time then we've
[26:57] got ephesians
[26:59] does everybody understand ephesians
[27:00] parallels joshua
[27:02] so the book of ephesians if you want to
[27:04] understand redemption read that book
[27:07] okay now i'm going to stop here and say
[27:09] something your pastor's been in that
[27:10] book
[27:11] how many parts have you been preaching
[27:12] predestination
[27:14] can you preach predestination and not
[27:16] preach how to
[27:17] you've got to have ephesians to do it
[27:19] right so ephesians the predestination
[27:22] the perfect church
[27:23] in ephesians right we understand brother
[27:25] brahm said the corinthian church was a
[27:27] messed up church
[27:28] god had to constantly correct that
[27:30] church
[27:31] i preached a message at our church one
[27:33] time i said gathered here you know
[27:35] there's three types of believers here
[27:37] today
[27:39] unbeliever make believer believer
[27:41] and you know i said i'm going to divide
[27:43] the church right down the middle i'm
[27:44] going to pretend
[27:45] corinthians over here ephesians over
[27:47] here the corinthians ones you've got to
[27:49] correct all the time the ephesians ones
[27:51] are that perfect predestinated bunch
[27:53] that you don't have to constantly tell
[27:55] them the do's and don'ts but you can get
[27:57] into the mysteries
[27:59] you can bring them to perfection you see
[28:01] what i'm saying
[28:02] so ephesians is really what it is it's
[28:05] bringing you to perfection is what it is
[28:07] so it's a type of redemption and the
[28:09] other book is revelations
[28:11] does everybody understand the entire
[28:13] book of revelations is nothing more than
[28:15] redemption
[28:17] and i'll explain that all the way from
[28:18] chapter brother branham really isolates
[28:21] chapter five when he talks about
[28:22] redemption right
[28:24] he says the book that was opened there
[28:25] was a book of redemption
[28:27] now i'm going to tell you where can you
[28:28] prove that in the bible
[28:31] you can't can you
[28:33] there's nowhere you can prove it now i'm
[28:35] going to make a real startling statement
[28:36] to you
[28:38] the term the book of redemption is not
[28:40] even in the bible
[28:42] you go out to the bible and you look at
[28:44] retrieving book of redemption you won't
[28:46] find one head right if you go out the
[28:48] message you'll find 63. yeah
[28:51] does everybody agree
[28:53] so when we talk about the book of
[28:54] redemption i wanted to understand what
[28:57] is the book of redemption right right so
[28:59] i said i've got to go to the bible face
[29:00] final resting place is in the word
[29:03] come on isn't it
[29:05] so i got to find it in there but you
[29:06] won't find the phrase book of redemption
[29:09] anywhere in the
[29:10] bible in the message you'll find it but
[29:12] you will not find it there
[29:14] so i got to thinking what and i'm kind
[29:16] of getting ahead of myself here but i
[29:17] want to let you know so you can kind of
[29:19] see where i'm going to go there so what
[29:20] is the book of redemption it's a
[29:22] mysterious book
[29:25] it's a mystery
[29:27] that's what the book of redemption is
[29:29] it's a and i can read a quote where
[29:30] brother ram said it and i in a minute
[29:32] i'll read it just to back up i'm not
[29:34] just
[29:34] saying it myself but brother ma'am said
[29:36] the book of redemption is a mysterious
[29:37] book
[29:39] is that right
[29:40] the term book of redemption is not even
[29:42] mentioned in the bible the term book of
[29:44] redemption is a theologian that read
[29:46] exodus and said well this is redemption
[29:48] and they're right
[29:50] they have they're right exodus is a book
[29:52] of redemption and all those five books
[29:55] that i listed brother random referred to
[29:57] them throughout the message as book of
[29:59] redemption
[30:00] so
[30:02] when i when
[30:03] this is what i want to get today what
[30:04] i'm going to talk about this morning and
[30:06] tonight i want to talk about the book of
[30:08] redemption that's really what i want to
[30:09] talk about because i told my church i
[30:11] said you know i want to understand it
[30:13] i really want to understand the book of
[30:15] redemption so i know it's a mysterious
[30:17] book so for us to understand the book of
[30:19] redemption we're going to have to get
[30:21] into the mysteries of the message
[30:23] is that is that fair is that fair
[30:25] now do you need to have a revelation of
[30:28] the book of redemption yes you do
[30:31] the mysteries are the important part
[30:33] that's been passed down through this day
[30:35] so i'm going to talk about that you know
[30:37] and so when i refer to book of
[30:39] redemption right away your brain ought
[30:41] to say these are the mysteries he's
[30:42] going to talk about
[30:44] right
[30:44] that's what you've been preaching on for
[30:46] how many parts you've been on
[30:47] predestination
[30:49] it's a mystery to them out there
[30:51] i mean they got parts of it
[30:53] you go to a baptist church they'll
[30:55] preach predestination
[30:57] won't they
[30:58] right they will but man it's once saved
[31:00] always say once you're a baptist you
[31:01] dress like the world you do anything you
[31:03] want to do we don't believe it that way
[31:06] we believe priya's destination by four
[31:08] knowledge
[31:09] is that right we believe that if you're
[31:11] predestinated to it then you'll confirm
[31:13] conform to the word
[31:16] is that right and that's the way we
[31:17] believe here we believe in
[31:18] predestination we just don't believe it
[31:20] like they do
[31:22] we believe it's free moral agency i
[31:24] don't think god will take your free
[31:25] moral agency away even when you have the
[31:27] baptism holy ghost
[31:28] i told the church after i get preaching
[31:30] today if i want to go smoke a cigarette
[31:32] i could do it
[31:34] but i don't have the want to
[31:36] does everybody understand so god's never
[31:38] going to take away your free moral
[31:39] agency
[31:40] but some people think oh boy man when
[31:42] you get the holy ghost you'll never make
[31:44] a mistake
[31:47] wow
[31:49] they live in a different world than i
[31:51] live in
[31:53] i mean you know i'd like to get like to
[31:55] that point but as long as i got this boy
[31:57] with me
[31:58] this cannot be perfected does everybody
[32:00] understand that
[32:02] you can try your hardest and this boy is
[32:04] going to let you down every day
[32:07] so that's why i was saying before what
[32:09] i've understood looking at the book of
[32:10] redemption i
[32:12] am a failure at best that's right
[32:15] amen
[32:16] i believe that i really do
[32:19] so i want to read a scripture now and i
[32:20] want to go to you know what i did was i
[32:23] went through the book of redemption and
[32:24] and preached in it
[32:27] i went to uh revelations and preached
[32:29] revelation chapter five
[32:31] and then when in preaching
[32:33] starting through redemption it actually
[32:34] uncovers the whole book of revelation
[32:36] that's right
[32:37] did you know that we refer to well you
[32:40] know brother brahm said and you go look
[32:41] at i'd like to kind of sum up revelation
[32:44] revelation chapter 1 is telling you
[32:45] about jesus christ
[32:47] about the deity of jesus christ
[32:50] is that right
[32:51] so that's an important step in
[32:53] redemption
[32:55] then the second the third chapter tells
[32:57] you about the church ages
[32:59] right
[33:00] chapter four says come up hither
[33:02] brother said it's the rapture
[33:05] how many do you see on the throne in
[33:06] chapter three four one
[33:09] there's one that's set up on the throne
[33:11] you've been caught up hither you've been
[33:13] caught up higher than the church ages
[33:16] the churches out there believing the
[33:17] trinitarian doctrine i don't believe
[33:19] that
[33:20] i've come up hither i see one throne is
[33:22] what i see is that right there's a
[33:24] doorman open to me and that door is
[33:26] jesus christ
[33:28] i know who my redeemer is
[33:31] see redemption is you've got to know who
[33:32] the redeemer is but you got to know who
[33:34] you are too
[33:36] does everybody agree with that
[33:37] so chapter four you come up you're in a
[33:39] rapture okay the rapture is caught up
[33:43] what how are we caught up in a
[33:44] revelation
[33:46] we have a much higher revelation than
[33:48] what they had through the church ages
[33:50] that's chapter four chapter five brother
[33:52] baby said chapter five was a book of
[33:53] redemption is that what he said amen
[33:56] and you know i i looked at it and you
[33:58] know and i hear preachers they say well
[34:00] the reason that john the revelator
[34:03] stopped crying because he's seen who
[34:04] jesus was right that he was the lamb of
[34:07] god
[34:08] the flesh of god
[34:10] i tell our church when you see lamb of
[34:11] god you put this in their fleshy god
[34:14] because lamb is talking about flesh
[34:16] so jesus christ was the flesh of god
[34:19] does everybody understand that
[34:21] so we in chapter 5 we understand that
[34:24] jesus christ is the flesh of god they
[34:27] say well that's why he quit crying
[34:29] true
[34:30] but that's only half the picture
[34:32] there's two things that made him quit
[34:33] crying
[34:34] not only did he see the flesh of god the
[34:37] redeemer he also seen he was the
[34:39] redeemed
[34:41] so not only did he see who jesus was he
[34:43] seen who he was
[34:45] he sent his name on the book
[34:48] right the book of life
[34:50] now that's what he sees so the reason
[34:52] john the revelator quit crying it was
[34:55] two parts to it not just one exactly
[34:58] right you gotta identify it's not enough
[35:00] jesus's identifying the word you have to
[35:03] be identified the word too
[35:05] so a part of redemption you're a part of
[35:07] it
[35:08] he's the redeemer you're the redeemed so
[35:10] john the revelator seen that in chapter
[35:12] five does everybody agree
[35:15] that's what he's seen and i'm going to
[35:16] stop there because that's as far as i'm
[35:18] going to book a redemption
[35:19] today anyway
[35:21] so i want to read a scripture to you so
[35:23] now i'm in the book of exodus i've been
[35:25] on there for 20 parts i think you're 20
[35:28] parts on predestination
[35:30] and that's wonderful there's nothing
[35:32] wrong with that
[35:33] and you know i told the church when
[35:34] you're past there's one quality about a
[35:36] pastor i've learned a pastor doesn't
[35:38] mind repeating himself
[35:40] has anybody ever watched evangelists
[35:42] they hate to come to your church and
[35:43] preach the same message over again
[35:46] i've had one particular preacher and
[35:47] just i laugh at it because i'm a pastor
[35:50] see i don't he he preaches a message
[35:53] he'll come to me when he preaches you
[35:55] know because he's an older gentleman and
[35:56] say if i ever preach that at your church
[35:59] if i say yeah he won't preach it again
[36:01] i thought you're definitely not a pastor
[36:03] i can tell that because you don't have
[36:05] the quality of a pastor when you're a
[36:07] pastor you'll preach that thing a
[36:08] hundred times until they get it
[36:10] and i told the church i'll tell you how
[36:12] i am as a pastor i'm like a pit bull
[36:14] with a bone
[36:15] try to get it from me
[36:17] the only way i'm going to give up that
[36:18] bone is when i know you got it
[36:21] i can look at your faces
[36:23] there's some god gives in a pastor a
[36:24] gift to know when you got it and it's
[36:26] time to move on do you agree
[36:29] and you'll stay with predestination
[36:30] you're on 20 if it takes 120 you're
[36:33] going to stay right there until they get
[36:34] it
[36:35] and i'm going to tell you something
[36:36] predestination is a
[36:38] part of
[36:40] the book of redemption it's a part of
[36:42] your redemption
[36:44] and i i might read it here in a minute
[36:47] but as i was going through and i've been
[36:48] going through the book of exodus i said
[36:50] the book of exodus to me
[36:53] shows the characteristics of redemption
[36:56] that's why they say it's the book of
[36:57] redemption either coming out going into
[37:00] but it shows you a lot of the
[37:02] the the the characteristics of how
[37:04] you're going to get all the way does
[37:06] everybody understand that and so
[37:09] i want to stop now and i want to read
[37:10] exodus 6 for a minute and it's kind of
[37:13] what i said earlier i'm going to take a
[37:14] drink my allergies have been killing me
[37:16] since i got off the plane
[37:17] i don't know what's growing here but wow
[37:22] i got to brother wade's what was it
[37:24] friday afternoon i was so sick i didn't
[37:27] think i'd be able to preach today he had
[37:28] he's going to have teeth work done so he
[37:30] put him on some amoxicillin well he had
[37:33] enough for me too
[37:34] so hey it all worked out so i mean me
[37:37] and him been sharing a matter of fact i
[37:38] got the bottle now
[37:40] so
[37:41] we've been sharing his bottle let me
[37:42] tell you that so we're real brothers we
[37:44] can take the same pills
[37:47] we can chew the same gum dude you know
[37:49] that
[37:51] right brother way so i appreciate it but
[37:53] god knew what i need he had it right
[37:54] here for me
[37:56] so i'm going to just keep moving on
[37:57] today so i want to turn if you would
[37:59] with you got your bibles let's turn to
[38:01] exodus 6 6.
[38:04] and this is a part of redemption
[38:07] and the reason the reason i read hebrews
[38:09] 11 is
[38:10] look there is no such prevailing power
[38:13] as a revelation from god
[38:15] the most important thing that this
[38:16] church each and every one of you here
[38:18] will have is a revelation all right
[38:20] there's that does your meal that you eat
[38:23] your job that you have
[38:26] your wife your daddy your husband what
[38:28] there's nothing more important than a
[38:30] revelation from god it's impossible to
[38:33] even please god without it
[38:35] and god has put that in in the bible for
[38:38] a real reason and god put it on display
[38:41] in exodus 6. now let me read it
[38:44] let me read what it says i i when i've
[38:45] read this it's been one of my favorite
[38:47] scriptures now
[38:48] when i go to the next subject i do
[38:50] that'll be my favorite scripture i don't
[38:52] know if you're that way that's kind of
[38:53] the way i am
[38:54] so exodus 6 6 wherefore say to the
[38:57] children of israel i am the lord first
[39:00] thing you're going to know
[39:02] what happened in revelation chapter 4
[39:03] when you come up here you're going to
[39:05] know i am the lord right
[39:07] right what did israel have to know i am
[39:09] the lord thy god
[39:11] right they didn't bring those heathen
[39:13] gods with them on the journey
[39:15] when they come out as part of the
[39:17] redemption they knew who god was okay
[39:19] can i say it that way
[39:21] and listen this is what i'll listen to
[39:23] after this what it says and i
[39:25] will bring you out from the burdens of
[39:27] the egyptians god's going to do it
[39:29] and i will rid you out of their bondage
[39:33] and i will redeem you with a stretched
[39:35] out arm
[39:36] who's that stretch forward out on moses
[39:40] right what was the vessel he used moses
[39:46] and with great judgments and i will take
[39:49] you to me for a people and i will be to
[39:52] you a god
[39:53] and this is the only thing that you're
[39:55] going to have something to do with
[39:57] and you shall know that i am the lord
[39:59] glory amen remember the last time i was
[40:01] here i preached i know
[40:03] and i said anytime you see the word i
[40:05] know in the bible it means faith
[40:07] it means a revelation is that right the
[40:10] woman and i don't know if you know this
[40:11] the woman who touched the heart the
[40:13] garment of jesus robin was healed the
[40:16] the priests and the scribes in that hour
[40:18] were preaching doctrine in the
[40:20] in the synagogues that this is what they
[40:23] said it's something they said okay they
[40:25] said when a messiah comes
[40:28] you can you know he'll walk through the
[40:29] city you can touch the hill and his
[40:31] garment and you'll be healed
[40:33] so what when that sister who had that
[40:35] issue for what 12 years or however long
[40:37] a long time
[40:39] when she's seen him walking through
[40:41] she said in her mind she had a
[40:43] revelation that was the messiah
[40:46] does everybody understand that she said
[40:48] i know if i can touch the hem of this
[40:50] garment i'll be saved
[40:52] why because the scribes and pharisees
[40:54] said when a messiah comes you touch the
[40:56] hem of his garment you'll be saved what
[40:58] she put on display was her revelation
[41:00] amen god honored her revelation jesus
[41:03] was walking along and stopped all of a
[41:05] sudden said who touched me peter said
[41:07] are you kidding me the people are
[41:09] pressing you and you want to know who
[41:10] touched you
[41:11] he said i feel virtue has left me
[41:14] what was it god had to honor that little
[41:16] woman's faith because that woman openly
[41:19] was testifying now you heard what the
[41:20] scribes and pharisees said
[41:22] i believe this man's the messiah i've
[41:25] got an issue of blood that nothing will
[41:26] take care of it but i know if i touches
[41:29] him i'll be healed did she get it
[41:32] god honored her revelation does
[41:34] everybody understand that so there's one
[41:36] thing in coming out of egypt there's
[41:38] only one thing you got to do you got to
[41:40] know
[41:41] you got to have a revelation
[41:43] that's why it's part of redemption
[41:45] there's nothing more important than a
[41:46] revelation of god
[41:48] that's the most important thing you can
[41:50] have in this hour is a revelation
[41:54] right
[41:54] now everybody understand a revelation is
[41:57] something that's been made known to you
[41:59] it's something that god has personally
[42:02] revealed to you
[42:03] and he says ye shall know
[42:06] right he made it personal to israel
[42:08] you're gonna know i did all that you had
[42:10] nothing to do with it israel but one
[42:12] thing you better under you better have a
[42:14] revelation it's me doing it right it's
[42:16] not you doing it i'm doing it for you
[42:18] that's right that's right it's not what
[42:20] abraham did it's what god did for him
[42:23] so a big part of redemption is you need
[42:25] to understand he's the one doing it
[42:28] right
[42:29] sure he is
[42:34] and i went and i read a couple and i got
[42:35] a couple quotes here if you want to put
[42:37] it on the right where it says exodus
[42:39] there's a couple of quotes i read what i
[42:41] do is i don't know brother i'm sure
[42:42] brother's saying the same this guy i
[42:44] call him say where can you find this
[42:46] quote i've heard preachers say it and
[42:48] they paraphrase it you know i paraphrase
[42:50] scripture
[42:51] you know i paraphrase quotes there's
[42:53] nothing wrong with that
[42:54] but i've heard people paraphrase i say
[42:56] where is it and he'll say well i think
[42:57] it's and sure enough it'll be there
[42:59] man i wish i had this guy's brain
[43:02] i
[43:02] like to say i am numb minded
[43:05] so i call him someone and say you know
[43:07] yeah i do and he'll tell me and sure
[43:08] enough it's there
[43:10] amazes me but let's look at this first
[43:12] quote he says now we've been speaking in
[43:14] the book of exodus and this was in 1955
[43:17] which is the book of the calling out the
[43:19] book of redemption
[43:22] of the old testament i love it because
[43:24] it's a beautiful book and i believe that
[43:26] it's very profitable for us to study it
[43:28] now amen now does everybody understand
[43:30] that
[43:31] that's what he said because i believe
[43:33] the church is in another exodus
[43:36] everybody's read or heard the tape third
[43:38] exodus right
[43:39] everybody understands we're in a third
[43:41] exodus
[43:42] okay
[43:44] the church is in another exodus calling
[43:46] out the exodus means called out called
[43:47] out means the church
[43:50] and now god is calling his people out of
[43:53] every walk of life
[43:55] to come and receive him and to believe
[43:58] on him and he's showing great signs and
[44:00] wonders in these last days and he's
[44:03] calling people ministers from all walks
[44:05] of life
[44:06] call them into the ministry
[44:09] right
[44:10] next quote pop it up here on this one on
[44:12] the exodus
[44:15] this is in 1954 and i really i really
[44:17] love this listen i'm going to show you
[44:19] how important brother man thought the
[44:21] book of exodus was listen to what he
[44:23] said when i read this it kind of i
[44:25] thought why
[44:26] why is he telling us this is so
[44:27] important there's got to be a reason
[44:29] behind him saying
[44:30] so he says we're taking israel now in
[44:32] their journey coming do you know brother
[44:34] branham preached a year on exodus
[44:37] you've read the quote where brother adam
[44:38] said we too he took a year on exodus
[44:41] so exodus is a very important book in
[44:43] the bible
[44:44] now it's all important i'm going to eat
[44:46] the whole book is that right
[44:48] i'm not some of these guys are going to
[44:50] tear certain books out
[44:51] because they say it don't apply to us
[44:54] look the whole book's the book of
[44:55] redemption
[44:57] what do you mean it don't apply to me
[45:01] you're a jew inwardly
[45:03] right
[45:04] i'm gonna i'm gonna say something ahead
[45:05] of time
[45:06] daniel's 70 weeks is redemption to
[45:08] israel glory
[45:10] you agree with that we i know he does
[45:13] so you're going to tear redemption out
[45:15] of the book
[45:16] you need all the book
[45:18] if god ever set up a a way to redeem
[45:21] israel he's going to redeem us the same
[45:23] way exactly
[45:26] six-fold purpose of daniel was to redeem
[45:28] israel
[45:30] right do you agree six seals we redeemed
[45:33] us
[45:34] the seventh seal was the coming of the
[45:36] lord
[45:38] right amen
[45:39] that's what it so god's way he redeemed
[45:41] israel is exactly the same way he
[45:43] redeemed us
[45:44] is exactly the same way he'll redeem the
[45:46] earth so if god ever sets a plan or
[45:49] redemption up he can't set it up for the
[45:51] jews one way and us another if he did
[45:53] then god found a better way to do it
[45:56] see god's not like us he don't build a
[45:58] house and step back and say man i wish i
[45:59] wouldn't put them steps there
[46:01] no is that what we do see we're a
[46:03] failure at best you see what i'm getting
[46:05] but god don't do it that way once god
[46:07] puts something in the scripture it's
[46:08] going to be that way and what you need
[46:10] to do is understand what it is
[46:13] because what people what they do now is
[46:16] they take away the how many knows the
[46:18] the church organizations if you start
[46:20] talking about a woman you know 22 5 says
[46:24] does it not in deuteronomy says a woman
[46:26] is not supposed to wear that to pertain
[46:28] it to a man
[46:29] when i was a kid i don't know about you
[46:32] when i was in a schoolyard we would
[46:34] tease other kids and say who wears the
[46:35] pants in your family
[46:38] right a pants was a very masculine thing
[46:41] not feminine
[46:43] i remember getting kicked in the shin by
[46:45] a little girl one time wearing this
[46:46] black and white oxfords
[46:49] did you wear them sister you might have
[46:50] your grin
[46:52] those leather stuck out that far
[46:54] that girl kicked me i thought i got
[46:56] kicked by a mule
[46:58] and what i told her was
[47:00] your mama wears the pants in your family
[47:02] boy that got her attention
[47:05] you know we used to know how we were
[47:07] wired in them days
[47:09] here down today i'm not sure how some
[47:11] people were wired out there
[47:15] does deuteronomy 25 still work today
[47:18] it does for me all right it really does
[47:22] we're talking israel now in their
[47:23] journey coming out of egypt type of the
[47:25] world on their way to palestine the
[47:27] promised land i think it's a beautiful
[47:29] thing i just love it listen to what your
[47:31] prophet said pretty near every week
[47:34] right
[47:35] i
[47:36] sat down and read through the book of
[47:37] exodus
[47:39] if i can or as much of it as i can i
[47:42] love it because it's a perfect type of
[47:44] the church today
[47:46] does everybody understand that that was
[47:48] a shadow of things to come
[47:51] the condition and how god is moving amen
[47:54] right
[47:55] move then what he did it in the natural
[47:58] then he's doing in a spiritual now
[48:01] see you're a jew inwardly is that what
[48:02] paul said
[48:04] so for us it's a spiritual thing for the
[48:06] jews it was a natural land a physical
[48:09] land
[48:10] but what our land is is the is the new
[48:13] body we're coming to
[48:15] it don't end with the holy ghost people
[48:18] does everybody it's not it doesn't end
[48:21] you've got to get a glorified body like
[48:23] his body
[48:24] that's how you're going to make a
[48:25] rapture right
[48:27] flesh and blood will not inherit the
[48:29] kingdom of god
[48:30] you're going to have a body like that's
[48:32] why you're going to meet him in the air
[48:34] he's going to be there with a glorified
[48:36] body and you're going to meet him there
[48:38] you're not going to meet him with this
[48:39] ugly thing you see preaching today i'm
[48:41] going to be about a 20 year old man
[48:43] won't be prettier
[48:46] i'll be what i am here i like i told
[48:48] brother wade i wasn't in the pretty line
[48:51] i must have missed that line i was in
[48:53] the ugly line
[48:55] but you know god has big mountains
[48:56] little mountains did you know that right
[48:58] now
[49:00] whatever you are here whatever you were
[49:02] at 20 is what you're going to be there
[49:04] like it or not
[49:08] a perfect type of the church today the
[49:10] condition in how god is moving
[49:12] so don't be you know if you're fat who
[49:14] cares
[49:16] i'm not worried about it right
[49:19] but sure you'll be perfectly fat how's
[49:21] that
[49:24] i don't know how to say it god's a god
[49:26] of variety did you know that
[49:28] right he didn't make us all beautiful
[49:32] move the yeah i know move then what did
[49:34] he what
[49:35] he did in the natural then he's doing
[49:37] his spiritual see it now there he led it
[49:40] natural israel natural where they seen
[49:43] look move them out of a certain land
[49:45] into another natural land
[49:47] now we're moved by the holy spirit in
[49:50] going now into the promised land you
[49:52] believe we're on a road to a promised
[49:54] land
[49:56] in my father's house is many mansions if
[49:59] it wasn't so i would have told you i'll
[50:02] go and prepare a place for you
[50:04] is that right now we have a promised
[50:07] land that we're going to and each day
[50:09] marks a milestone
[50:11] has anybody ever done any project work
[50:13] knows what a milestone is
[50:16] you're grinning you've done it you know
[50:17] what the word means when i worked in i.t
[50:19] work like when we got 25 percent through
[50:21] a project
[50:23] we had a party we had cake we had punch
[50:25] we meet we meet we reached a milestone
[50:29] is that what we did if anybody's ever
[50:31] done a project that's what we did
[50:33] hey you were part of the team and boy we
[50:35] reached a milestone we're going to
[50:36] celebrate every day ought to be a
[50:37] milestone
[50:38] every day ought to be a celebration to
[50:40] you
[50:41] every day when you get home at night and
[50:43] you still believe the message
[50:45] you still are pressing on toward the
[50:47] mark of the eye calling like paul said
[50:49] it's a milestone to you
[50:51] before you lay down and go to bed
[50:52] tonight you ought to thank god you ought
[50:54] to have a celebration
[50:56] that he kept you
[50:57] it's not what you did it's what he did
[51:00] on the journey
[51:01] so every day is a milestone another day
[51:04] another milestone
[51:06] see we're on a journey like it or not
[51:08] we're on a journey a spiritual journey
[51:11] right
[51:14] so that's what we're on so
[51:17] i wanted to bring in two quotes to you i
[51:18] thought that when brother brahm said he
[51:20] read the book of exodus once a week
[51:23] i thought wow
[51:25] and then i started thinking about it i
[51:26] said why
[51:28] you know you do that don't you preachers
[51:30] are weird they're always why
[51:32] when they read something in the bible
[51:33] they go why
[51:34] and god starts dealing with him we start
[51:36] looking at close we start looking at the
[51:37] scripture and try to tie it all together
[51:39] why
[51:40] and i got to thinking well of course
[51:43] do you understand that we've had three
[51:44] exodus prophets
[51:46] and i preached the sermon exodus prophet
[51:48] so i'm gonna have touch on it today does
[51:50] everybody understand moses was an exodus
[51:52] prophet
[51:53] does everybody understand that jesus was
[51:55] an exodus prophet does everybody
[51:57] understand william branham was an exodus
[51:59] prophet
[52:01] and the way god dealt with moses is
[52:03] exactly the way he dealt with his son
[52:05] even moses said there will be a prophet
[52:07] likened unto me is that what he said in
[52:09] deuteronomy
[52:10] he said the lord thy god is going to
[52:12] send you a prophet likened unto me
[52:14] amen
[52:15] is that right so william branham was
[52:17] likened unto moses he was likened unto
[52:20] jesus does everybody understand
[52:22] he was no different did did god give
[52:25] moses two signs
[52:27] he did
[52:29] he gave him the rod that he could throw
[52:30] down now those rods those signs had a
[52:33] voice to him do you agree
[52:36] so that rod that god gave moses when he
[52:38] threw it down and then
[52:40] janice and jamborees could do the same
[52:42] trick or a trick not god doing but the
[52:45] trick
[52:46] they threw it down and his rod ate their
[52:49] rod
[52:50] you know what that rod was telling you
[52:52] no matter what pharaoh on his musicians
[52:53] you're going to throw at you your rod's
[52:55] going to overcome their world
[52:58] that was the type of the rod that mo so
[53:00] moses no matter what pharaoh throws down
[53:02] in front of you boy
[53:04] you're going to overcome it right
[53:06] do you know we're more than overcomers
[53:08] in this hour no matter what the devil
[53:10] pharaoh throws down in front of you
[53:13] my rod's going to eat theirs up
[53:15] there is nothing going to stop us
[53:17] there's nothing to stop jesus christ
[53:19] there's nothing that stopped william
[53:20] branham either
[53:22] so that's what the rod in the healing he
[53:24] would take his hand stick in his coat
[53:26] pull it out and i'm going to tell you i
[53:29] don't know about you but when you pull
[53:31] that thing out he said it was white with
[53:32] leprosy does anybody understand when it
[53:34] turns white right after that the whole
[53:36] thing falls off right
[53:38] i tell you what if i bet moses jumped
[53:40] back 10 yards it would have scared the
[53:41] fire out of me
[53:43] pull that thing in and stick it out and
[53:44] that thing was white leprosy that's the
[53:46] final stage is leprosy right
[53:49] that that thing their fingers fall off
[53:52] man he jumped back and he looked at him
[53:53] so can i stick it back in he stuck it
[53:54] back in it was restored
[53:57] right
[53:58] so what it's showing you is moses was a
[54:00] restoration prophet
[54:03] that was the voice that spoke by the
[54:05] sign these these things that god gave
[54:06] brother man were not frivolous
[54:09] they spoke to us they told us what it is
[54:12] the sign has a voice right sure
[54:15] everybody got that
[54:16] so each one of the prophets got two
[54:18] signs
[54:20] three pools can i say it that way are
[54:22] you okay
[54:23] and the third one was the voice of the
[54:25] sign exactly
[54:27] right
[54:28] he had a thunder to it it really did
[54:31] in jesus hour and what was he going to
[54:33] what did moses what was moses purpose to
[54:36] restore the people back to a natural
[54:38] promised land
[54:40] and to get them positionally placed in
[54:42] that land is that right
[54:44] do you know the names of those children
[54:45] of israel was their names meant
[54:48] if you look up what they're meaning
[54:49] that's how they were placed in the land
[54:51] joshua
[54:53] right amen right you know how you're
[54:55] placed in the land by your name that was
[54:57] put on a book before the foundation of
[54:59] the world
[55:00] when you see your name on the book
[55:03] that name on that book is what
[55:04] positionally places you down here
[55:07] is everybody okay with that amen so then
[55:10] jesus come he had two signs right
[55:12] jesus had healing what did it prove
[55:15] jesus was a restoration prophet amen
[55:18] any time you see a prophet with healing
[55:20] in their ministry it's showing you
[55:22] there's a restoration in the earth
[55:25] right brother man said the healing is a
[55:27] restoration of your body right
[55:30] right
[55:31] so jesus came and he they when he healed
[55:33] and lay hand over the seat they loved
[55:35] him
[55:36] there wasn't a church out there that
[55:37] wouldn't have jesus in them that's right
[55:39] the second pool was prophecy
[55:42] come on
[55:44] everybody agree with that
[55:46] so jesus had a sign where he could
[55:48] discern the thought and intent of the
[55:49] heart right
[55:51] everybody agree with that amen
[55:53] the woman at the well he discerned her
[55:55] thought in the title of her heart right
[55:57] he said yep you sure do you've got six
[56:00] husbands and one you're living with now
[56:01] ain't yours right
[56:03] so he deserved the thought the woman
[56:05] didn't speak that he discerned that
[56:08] i'm going to tell you something about
[56:09] that discernment gift the first time we
[56:11] ever seen it was with melchizedek
[56:14] i'm going to tell you something when you
[56:15] get you see discernment in the land like
[56:17] that it's doom right right
[56:19] it's impending doom right because when
[56:22] god sent that sign with melchizedek when
[56:24] melchizedek was standing standing there
[56:26] and deserve the thought intent of
[56:28] sarah's heart behind the tent
[56:30] it wasn't a day or two later sodom was
[56:32] destroyed with fire
[56:34] right
[56:35] so the every sign that god gave those
[56:37] prophets it was a voice to that sign
[56:40] and the voice for that sign of
[56:42] discernment was there was impending doom
[56:44] coming
[56:45] in melchizedek sodom gomorrah was burned
[56:48] in the hour of jesus 40 years after he
[56:50] prophesied in 70 a.d
[56:52] titus surrounded jerusalem and destroyed
[56:55] her she became desolate exactly does
[56:57] everybody understand that
[57:00] in this hour we've had another prophet
[57:02] william branham he's had discernment
[57:05] and it's impending doom for america
[57:07] he even said i see america burning i see
[57:11] craters i see america burning is that
[57:13] right
[57:14] so what is it it's it's that sign of
[57:17] that was a end-time sign
[57:20] it showed the gentile people were at the
[57:22] end of our road
[57:24] it's a serious hour we live in america
[57:28] right
[57:29] so we understand jesus the first one was
[57:31] his healing the second one was the
[57:33] discernment
[57:34] so and if the people would have picked
[57:36] up they could have went to the old
[57:37] testament figured out when they seen
[57:38] that sign with melchizedek
[57:40] it was a short while later sodom was
[57:42] destroyed
[57:44] right they should have picked up on what
[57:46] the sign was so the sign had a voice
[57:49] so in our hour we've had another exodus
[57:52] prophet in william marion branham
[57:54] that's why he could sit there and preach
[57:56] the third exodus
[57:58] we are right now on the journey of the
[58:01] third exodus or moving toward our new
[58:03] body
[58:04] a house not made with hands
[58:07] is that right
[58:09] so brother madam what was his first pull
[58:11] hand
[58:12] he would grab somebody and bumps would
[58:14] come up he could say well you got this
[58:17] or you got that by what came up on his
[58:19] hand
[58:20] but brother brandon when he prayed for
[58:22] him he'd grab their hand and he'd be his
[58:23] hand wouldn't do that right so what was
[58:26] it healing campaigns
[58:28] what was it there was a restoration
[58:31] prophet in the land again
[58:33] the voice of the sign is we have had a
[58:35] restoration prophet that's going to
[58:37] restore us back to something
[58:39] is that fair to say
[58:41] in moses day he restored him to a
[58:43] natural land right in jesus hour he
[58:46] restored the word to him right
[58:49] right
[58:50] in this hour what what have we had
[58:52] restored back to us
[58:54] what have we got back the book of
[58:55] redemption
[59:00] can i say it this way the book of life
[59:04] now the book of redemption is different
[59:05] in the book of life
[59:06] i'm gonna be honest with you it is and
[59:08] i'm gonna explain to you how it is
[59:10] okay
[59:11] but if you look well let me i'll get
[59:13] there i'm gonna get there this afternoon
[59:15] i'm not gonna get ahead of myself if i
[59:16] can keep from it
[59:17] so we understand william mary and brian
[59:19] do we believe he's a prophet i do
[59:21] i'm not ashamed to say it at all the
[59:23] reason i'm not ashamed to say it because
[59:25] it's in the scriptures
[59:28] moses was vindicated because in the days
[59:30] of abraham he said god's going to take
[59:33] you out of out of bondage with a strong
[59:35] hand right
[59:37] he said 400 years from now it's going to
[59:39] happen right
[59:40] you know how many anybody understand how
[59:42] many years it happened 440. did god lie
[59:44] about his word
[59:46] the people of israel the israelites
[59:48] weren't ready to come out yet
[59:49] it was the readiness of israel that held
[59:51] them up do you agree
[59:53] we got in this hour where most people
[59:55] that pick on this message will say
[59:57] brother and prophesy or predicted
[59:59] brother brahma never said prophesy
[1:00:02] brother brahman said i predict now did
[1:00:03] the lord allow him to he said the lord
[1:00:05] allowed him to say that did you know
[1:00:06] that yeah
[1:00:07] but he said i predict 1977
[1:00:11] by the seven visions that he had and the
[1:00:13] last one was america laying in ruins
[1:00:16] is that right
[1:00:18] he said i predict by the way things are
[1:00:20] going so fast science and everything
[1:00:23] that in 1977
[1:00:25] that all seven of the visions would come
[1:00:27] would be fulfilled right
[1:00:29] but you know what you know this is my
[1:00:31] humble opinion i'll say it that way
[1:00:34] to me we weren't ready to go out in 1970
[1:00:37] some of you weren't even in the church
[1:00:38] then
[1:00:40] what held it up the readiness of the
[1:00:41] bride do i have a problem with brother
[1:00:43] brown say in 1977 no not a bit
[1:00:48] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:00:49] after the seals world and brother bram
[1:00:50] never said it again
[1:00:54] go ahead see if there's a quote i've
[1:00:56] looked at it and you have to there's no
[1:00:57] quote after the seals
[1:00:59] why because that mighty angel come down
[1:01:00] and said time will be no more right it's
[1:01:02] no calendar it's no time on what we got
[1:01:06] does everybody understand that
[1:01:08] i'm going to be honest with there's no
[1:01:09] more revelation after that
[1:01:11] the mystery of god was finished when
[1:01:13] that prophet exactly preached those
[1:01:15] seals
[1:01:16] all we can do is say what's said on tape
[1:01:18] exactly and try to break it down so you
[1:01:21] everybody here can get it in your gray
[1:01:23] matter and it'll drop down into your
[1:01:24] heart
[1:01:26] brother ram talk about intellectual
[1:01:27] revelation
[1:01:29] right and then a true revelation is down
[1:01:31] on the third pull the inside of the
[1:01:33] inside
[1:01:34] you know your intellect will run out
[1:01:37] oh yeah you know that's what we're
[1:01:38] seeing in the message we see people have
[1:01:39] been in the message thirty and four some
[1:01:41] of you might have been how many of you
[1:01:42] have been here how many has been in this
[1:01:43] message 30 years
[1:01:45] can you imagine dropping out
[1:01:48] there's been guys in the message 30
[1:01:50] years and dropping out
[1:01:53] you know what they had an intellectual
[1:01:54] conception of the message but they never
[1:01:56] had a revelation
[1:01:57] because if you've got a revelation that
[1:02:00] revelation is a foundation it's
[1:02:01] established
[1:02:03] a foundation once you pour it you don't
[1:02:04] change that exactly all right it's done
[1:02:07] is that right so when you've got a
[1:02:09] revelation it is it's a foundation it's
[1:02:11] established and you can put the house on
[1:02:14] it does everybody got that right so what
[1:02:16] happens to these guys they say well i
[1:02:18] was in the message then they blasted if
[1:02:20] brother brown was a prophet
[1:02:22] they never seen it in the scriptures
[1:02:24] they it was never revealed to him or
[1:02:26] made known to him
[1:02:28] they seen the works that he did
[1:02:31] they seen the healing campaign they seen
[1:02:33] the discernment but they never got to
[1:02:35] the third pull they never got a
[1:02:37] revelation of the message
[1:02:39] because everybody understand they never
[1:02:41] got to the mystery part of it
[1:02:44] i'm going to be honest with you guys if
[1:02:45] a preacher don't preach the mysteries
[1:02:47] the book of redemption can i say it that
[1:02:49] way it's a mysterious book if the
[1:02:51] preachers do not preach the mysteries
[1:02:55] that was contained under the seals
[1:02:56] they're not preaching rapturing faith
[1:02:59] exactly amen
[1:03:01] exactly amen
[1:03:03] brother ben said this ain't my thinking
[1:03:05] right it was beyond brother branham's
[1:03:07] intellect do you understand amen brother
[1:03:09] and brethren after 63 look at how many
[1:03:11] quotes where brother am said you ain't
[1:03:12] got a thought coming right
[1:03:14] that's after 63 you started making that
[1:03:17] see your thought your intellect ain't
[1:03:18] got nothing it's just gray matter your
[1:03:20] thoughts are as good as my thoughts your
[1:03:22] opinion's as good as my opinion
[1:03:24] i don't have opinion i have thus saith
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:29] i want lord to know when i say william
[1:03:31] branham was a prophet i got scripture to
[1:03:33] back me up
[1:03:34] now if you can't see it then you better
[1:03:36] ask for a revelation more than right
[1:03:39] your necessary meat
[1:03:41] that's what we need to be praying for
[1:03:42] this church right here needs to be
[1:03:44] paying praying for a revelation
[1:03:47] absolutely that's what you need to do
[1:03:50] and that's why the book of redemption
[1:03:51] it's a mysterious book amen it's a book
[1:03:54] of mysteries right and if a preacher in
[1:03:56] this message is not preaching the
[1:03:57] mysteries they're not preaching the book
[1:03:58] of redemption
[1:04:00] i don't know how else to put it that's
[1:04:02] what i put to our church
[1:04:03] that's why i think do we need to
[1:04:05] understand the book of redemption you
[1:04:06] better
[1:04:08] you better
[1:04:09] don't you think we need to understand it
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] let's start going through and i'm gonna
[1:04:14] go real quick and see what time you
[1:04:16] usually get out here in the morning
[1:04:20] what
[1:04:28] funny
[1:04:30] well there's time no more so don't worry
[1:04:32] about it
[1:04:33] i already preached that so i'm not gonna
[1:04:35] back off that okay
[1:04:37] i'm not gonna hold you too much longer i
[1:04:39] just wanted to lay this out and go to
[1:04:41] the go to exodus and we're gonna cruise
[1:04:43] through it real quick
[1:04:44] i preached 20 sermons and i've got to
[1:04:46] chapter 12 in exodus
[1:04:48] am i ever going to get done with it i
[1:04:50] can see why brother man it took a year
[1:04:51] to preach in it
[1:04:53] i told the church it took me seven
[1:04:55] messages to preach on the third pool
[1:04:57] finally the last day i was there i got
[1:04:59] through it in an hour i stood there in
[1:05:01] the pulpit and i went
[1:05:03] i've tried seven services to get this
[1:05:05] out and i finally got it out
[1:05:07] and you know not and i'm not trying to
[1:05:09] build me up don't get me wrong i'm not
[1:05:11] but a sister that's been in a message 40
[1:05:13] years
[1:05:14] put a note on my desk before that night
[1:05:16] service that sunday morning she said
[1:05:18] brother claude i've never understood the
[1:05:19] first pool the second pool or third pool
[1:05:22] like you have ministered it she said i
[1:05:24] now got the revelation of what it was
[1:05:27] i'm not building me up it makes me feel
[1:05:29] good that somebody got the mysteries of
[1:05:31] these things is that right
[1:05:34] okay now the first look and you've been
[1:05:36] preaching on predestination right
[1:05:38] so i'm going to show you the very first
[1:05:40] thing that it says in exodus is
[1:05:42] predestination
[1:05:44] look at what it says now these are the
[1:05:45] names of the children of israel which
[1:05:47] came into egypt every man in his
[1:05:49] household came with jacob
[1:05:51] the first thing as part of redemption is
[1:05:54] predestination
[1:05:55] this man has been preaching
[1:05:57] predestination
[1:05:58] he's trying to show you that
[1:05:59] predestination is a part of redemption
[1:06:02] that is that okay if i say it that way
[1:06:05] so you may say man this guy 28 times he
[1:06:08] repeats himself most of you ain't here
[1:06:10] two services in a row
[1:06:13] it took me seven services to preach
[1:06:15] third pool because i had two or three
[1:06:17] visitors and the people that are there
[1:06:19] ain't there half the time
[1:06:21] i told the people at our church you know
[1:06:23] what some of you are got a 33 chance of
[1:06:26] making the rapture
[1:06:28] because all you come to church is one
[1:06:29] out of three services amen brother baby
[1:06:32] said every every service could determine
[1:06:35] your final destiny exactly
[1:06:37] every service could determine your final
[1:06:40] destiny
[1:06:41] god's trying to get you this revelation
[1:06:43] of the book of redemption
[1:06:44] and you won't even show up to hear it
[1:06:47] amen amen if
[1:06:49] if i announced that in this afternoon
[1:06:51] service jesus christ would be here how
[1:06:52] many of you would be here
[1:06:54] i'm announcing he is going to be here
[1:06:57] he's here now and he's going to yeah
[1:06:59] he's going to be here this afternoon too
[1:07:01] so why are you missing scripture says to
[1:07:03] gather gather even more as you see the
[1:07:06] day appearing amen
[1:07:10] see it's these little things are going
[1:07:11] to get you that's right little foxes
[1:07:13] spoil the line
[1:07:15] okay
[1:07:17] i'm probably i don't know how much i'm
[1:07:19] going but i want to show you right at
[1:07:20] the beginning of a predestination it
[1:07:22] just blew me away then chapter six it
[1:07:24] rolls back into it again
[1:07:26] it says these are the names that went
[1:07:27] down into israel now in chapter six
[1:07:29] these are the names we were born down in
[1:07:31] israel
[1:07:32] i thought wow predestination so as a
[1:07:35] part of the book of redemption exodus
[1:07:37] predestination is clearly stated
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:41] okay and one thing i really
[1:07:44] i told him and you need to understand
[1:07:46] the book of life you really do
[1:07:48] but it comes down in pharaoh when moses
[1:07:51] came down to the people in egypt their
[1:07:53] burdens got greater
[1:07:55] sure
[1:07:56] you know what most people think when
[1:07:57] they come to the message they're coming
[1:07:58] it's going to be a flowery bed of ease
[1:08:01] and brother branham said if you packed
[1:08:03] for a picnic you packed wrong
[1:08:06] he said you better pack for a battle
[1:08:08] because when you come to this message
[1:08:10] pharaoh the devil is going to be after
[1:08:13] your hide
[1:08:15] as a matter of fact when moses come down
[1:08:18] there to egypt do you know they used to
[1:08:20] give them the straw
[1:08:22] and after that they said you go fetch
[1:08:24] your own straw
[1:08:26] the burdens when brother random come on
[1:08:28] into my life the battle got fiercer
[1:08:32] that's why i said it earlier that every
[1:08:34] devil in hell every gun's aimed at the
[1:08:36] bride
[1:08:37] so when you come to redemption when
[1:08:39] you're sitting here and you're going
[1:08:41] through the journey of redemption it is
[1:08:43] a harder battle than if you're not in it
[1:08:45] right
[1:08:46] does everybody understand that so in the
[1:08:48] book of exodus it'll show you the
[1:08:50] conditions that brother ram said
[1:08:53] of
[1:08:54] the re of redemption you understand and
[1:08:57] we're in a time of redemption now we're
[1:08:58] fixing to get out of here in a rapture
[1:09:01] that's an axis we understand that so the
[1:09:03] conditions that were back there the
[1:09:06] conditions that were in jesus day are
[1:09:08] the conditions that's in this hour
[1:09:10] the one quote i read you know who gave
[1:09:12] moses the most trouble
[1:09:15] 70 preachers
[1:09:17] who gave jesus the most trouble in that
[1:09:19] exodus
[1:09:20] describes the pharisees the religious
[1:09:22] order
[1:09:24] come on
[1:09:25] in this hour i read a quote the other
[1:09:27] day brother evan said i have not found
[1:09:29] one minister yet
[1:09:31] that agreed with me on serpent seed
[1:09:32] right exactly brother what did brother
[1:09:35] say the ones who give me in trouble are
[1:09:37] the preachers
[1:09:39] you know who'll get you in trouble
[1:09:40] preachers
[1:09:42] that's why you better check it look
[1:09:44] faith final resting place is in this
[1:09:49] if you're going to start taking a look
[1:09:50] at brother man's natural life he failed
[1:09:54] he was a man
[1:09:56] but if you start taking a look at thus
[1:09:57] saith the lord you'll see how god sent
[1:10:00] this prophet to take us out on an exodus
[1:10:05] if you start looking at this man's
[1:10:07] failures
[1:10:08] you're going to miss it but you better
[1:10:10] listen to what he says
[1:10:12] because god sent you a fivefold ministry
[1:10:14] to preach you the word
[1:10:16] to feed you the word a shepherd feeds
[1:10:19] you the word he don't rule over you
[1:10:22] he feeds you the word that's how this
[1:10:23] man is your shepherd
[1:10:26] right
[1:10:27] i'm not a dictator i don't have a
[1:10:29] nickelodeon spirit
[1:10:30] right i have never said in our church
[1:10:32] you've got to come here come on brother
[1:10:36] i don't have a nicolae in spirit
[1:10:38] but you got to come to the truth
[1:10:41] wherever the truth is you better come
[1:10:42] there because the truth is what's going
[1:10:44] to set you free
[1:10:47] now i'm going to go back to third exits
[1:10:49] just i know some new ones here so you i
[1:10:51] won't lose you
[1:10:52] the first exodus took israel out of
[1:10:54] natural egypt to a natural
[1:10:56] israel the second one brother brahm said
[1:10:59] the second exodus was with jesus christ
[1:11:02] so you've got to identify what was
[1:11:04] happening in the time of jesus
[1:11:06] moses wrote five books in the bible the
[1:11:08] pentateuch does everybody understand
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:10] and i don't remember which i get them
[1:11:12] confused i don't i can't for some reason
[1:11:14] i can't keep that straight there's a
[1:11:15] talmud and a torah
[1:11:17] does everybody understand that one of
[1:11:19] them's the five books of moses the other
[1:11:21] is 316 do's and don'ts that the scribes
[1:11:23] and pharisees come up
[1:11:25] it was burdens that the priest put on
[1:11:27] the people
[1:11:29] does everybody understand that
[1:11:31] and so what happened in jesus day he was
[1:11:33] taking them out of judaism
[1:11:35] judaism is the spirit where they took
[1:11:37] the five books
[1:11:40] and started putting grievous things on
[1:11:42] the people the do's and don'ts and all
[1:11:43] those things you understand
[1:11:45] that's what it was about
[1:11:47] so
[1:11:48] what god was taking
[1:11:50] israel out at the time of jesus he was
[1:11:53] taking them out of judaism
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:56] into a church
[1:11:58] is that what brother and said
[1:12:00] because why he's starting to church ages
[1:12:03] it's a dispensational change he's
[1:12:04] bringing them to a church
[1:12:06] now brother branham came in this hour to
[1:12:08] take us out of a church
[1:12:10] into a bride
[1:12:12] now i'm going to say it anything that's
[1:12:14] got an ism on the end of it it's a
[1:12:15] spirit right brother said communism is a
[1:12:18] spirit
[1:12:19] nazism is a spirit right catholicism is
[1:12:23] a spirit right
[1:12:24] denominationalism is a spirit
[1:12:27] right so brother said another quote he
[1:12:29] took us out of denominationalism into
[1:12:31] the bride
[1:12:32] is that right amen so we were we were
[1:12:36] plainly by the identifying the messenger
[1:12:39] by identifying what his message was
[1:12:42] we're thoroughly identified that we have
[1:12:44] entered into that third exodus
[1:12:47] and it's in the scriptures we don't just
[1:12:49] brother ram didn't hatch that up neither
[1:12:50] did we exactly everything we do daniel's
[1:12:53] 70 weeks is based off the scriptures
[1:12:57] everything we do faith final resting
[1:12:59] place revelation
[1:13:01] faith is the same word as revelation
[1:13:03] right revelations final resting place is
[1:13:06] in the word
[1:13:07] you know brother jess my old pastor used
[1:13:09] to tell him he said you got a revelation
[1:13:11] read it to me right yeah
[1:13:13] is that fair right if the mysteries were
[1:13:16] finished i told the church this in the
[1:13:18] days of the voice the seventh angel when
[1:13:20] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:13:22] god if i say the mystery of the word are
[1:13:23] you bugged out about it
[1:13:25] god here's the word
[1:13:27] in the beginning was the word where's
[1:13:28] with god the word was god
[1:13:30] the mystery of the word's finished
[1:13:33] i tell our church if some preacher comes
[1:13:34] here and preaches you a mystery run for
[1:13:36] your life
[1:13:37] if they preach you a revelation of the
[1:13:39] mystery
[1:13:40] okay amen
[1:13:42] well what we got in the message is
[1:13:44] preachers that come and preach another
[1:13:46] you know they preach a mystery exactly
[1:13:48] look the mysteries are what's binding up
[1:13:50] the revelation is what's going to set
[1:13:52] you free
[1:13:53] they're not going to take me back to
[1:13:54] egypt i'm going to tell you that right
[1:13:56] now they're not going to take me back to
[1:13:57] denominationalism amen the
[1:13:59] denominationalism had us all bound down
[1:14:01] in this hour
[1:14:02] brother said denominationalism had this
[1:14:05] holy spirit bound through the church
[1:14:08] that's why we had to experience
[1:14:09] revelation 4 a rapture
[1:14:12] does everybody understand that which is
[1:14:14] a catchy way pulling out of
[1:14:16] the church
[1:14:18] into the bride now we've entered into
[1:14:19] what the bright age
[1:14:21] i wonder brother brahm said we're in the
[1:14:22] bright age why because if you experience
[1:14:24] revelation four you're in the bride
[1:14:26] because what does this say after this
[1:14:29] after the church age come up hither
[1:14:31] that's where if your bride you're
[1:14:33] sitting you're come up hither
[1:14:35] you've got a revelation that so
[1:14:36] supersedes the church denominationalism
[1:14:40] and i'm not trying to say we're
[1:14:41] know-it-alls
[1:14:43] we're not that but look as part of the
[1:14:46] exodus would of israel come out of egypt
[1:14:48] if they wouldn't have accepted moses
[1:14:53] no
[1:14:54] so a part of redemption for israel a
[1:14:56] part of the uh redemption for them to
[1:14:59] come out of judea it was accepting jesus
[1:15:00] their prophet
[1:15:02] the god prophet exactly so the
[1:15:04] conditions are the same in this hour
[1:15:06] you got to understand predestination
[1:15:09] you've got to understand that god if god
[1:15:11] does anything amos 3 7 he first
[1:15:13] declareth his secret things his
[1:15:16] mysteries
[1:15:17] to his servants the prophets
[1:15:20] so god has sent a prophet in this hour
[1:15:23] and i'm not ashamed to say his name i'm
[1:15:25] not right because i see it in the word
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:31] it wasn't just the the first pull and
[1:15:33] second boy it was a sign but it had a
[1:15:35] voice to it that told me god has a
[1:15:38] restoration going on now and i want to
[1:15:39] be a part of it
[1:15:41] and not only that if you don't get this
[1:15:43] prophet you're doomed right
[1:15:46] brother said there's people walking the
[1:15:47] earth now that are cannon fodder
[1:15:51] well you know abraham could have said
[1:15:52] that in his hour
[1:15:54] so brother ram says it's gonna bug you
[1:15:55] out when he had the same sign
[1:15:58] right and the sign will had a voice to
[1:16:00] it that we're in a time of doom here
[1:16:03] you better get them out you better start
[1:16:06] you know in revelation 10 it's brother
[1:16:08] and said you're a little redeemer
[1:16:09] brother redeemer did he say that
[1:16:12] that's why in chapter 10 it tells us
[1:16:13] you're supposed to you've got an open
[1:16:15] book
[1:16:16] what's open the mysteries
[1:16:18] the book of redemptions open to you what
[1:16:20] are you supposed to do you ate the book
[1:16:22] and you're supposed to go give them the
[1:16:24] book now
[1:16:26] that's what's going to take a rapture
[1:16:28] that's what's going to get every nation
[1:16:29] kindred tongue
[1:16:31] just telling them god sent a prophet
[1:16:32] ain't good enough
[1:16:34] you've got to tell them what the prophet
[1:16:36] said what are these mysteries we're
[1:16:37] talking about
[1:16:39] we got preachers in a message afraid to
[1:16:41] preach the mysteries
[1:16:43] it just irritates me they keep the
[1:16:45] people from the raptures what they're
[1:16:46] doing that's what's going to get you out
[1:16:49] of here the revelation of these things
[1:16:52] no wonder he told israel you're going to
[1:16:54] know it that's the important part i'm
[1:16:56] going to do it the lord but you're going
[1:16:58] to know what i've done
[1:17:00] that's what you got to know in this hour
[1:17:02] god's doing the work and you've got to
[1:17:04] know what he's doing
[1:17:06] and if your name's on the book you will
[1:17:08] know what he's doing it'll be revealed
[1:17:10] to you
[1:17:12] because he said father all that thou
[1:17:14] hast
[1:17:15] given me all the ones that are on the
[1:17:17] name of book of life right
[1:17:19] father all thou hast given me shall come
[1:17:21] to me
[1:17:23] is that right and i'll not lose a one
[1:17:26] exactly amen now see predestination what
[1:17:29] he's meant god could look for it in
[1:17:30] foreknowledge and know who would accept
[1:17:33] it and who wouldn't
[1:17:34] when the gospel the mysteries the word
[1:17:37] the revelation of the hour come before
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:40] god knew who would accept and who would
[1:17:41] reject it
[1:17:42] if you reject it your name's not on the
[1:17:44] book
[1:17:46] i don't know how else to say it but if
[1:17:48] you accept it and you go all the way
[1:17:51] then your name's on the lamb's book of
[1:17:53] life
[1:17:55] is that right glory
[1:17:58] well we're in a serious hour this is
[1:18:00] what we're doing now is life and death
[1:18:02] for the gentile people we're at the end
[1:18:04] of the road
[1:18:05] by that melchizedek sign that was given
[1:18:07] to brother adam of discerning the
[1:18:08] thought and intent of the heart it's
[1:18:10] showing you the gentile kingdom has come
[1:18:11] to an end
[1:18:13] we're at the very end of time
[1:18:16] we're there
[1:18:17] i'm not looking for another
[1:18:19] mystery to be revealed
[1:18:21] they were all revealed through this
[1:18:22] prophet
[1:18:24] now do i catch your revelation every
[1:18:26] time i read a book yep there's
[1:18:27] revelation
[1:18:28] scripture says god's pathfinder now
[1:18:30] right you know i'm going to be in
[1:18:32] eternity god's eternal right if he's
[1:18:34] eternal he's constantly revealing
[1:18:36] himself amen on the other side do you
[1:18:38] realize god's going to be constantly
[1:18:40] revealing himself to us
[1:18:41] what you've got here is just a small
[1:18:43] part of what you're going to get over
[1:18:44] there
[1:18:45] and i don't know about you but when i
[1:18:47] get revelation i'm a happy man
[1:18:50] have you ever had a preacher preach
[1:18:51] something you don't understand it you
[1:18:52] get mad some of you may get mad at me
[1:18:54] today but you know he'll preach it again
[1:18:57] don't get too mad
[1:18:58] keep coming he'll break it down for you
[1:19:01] i took 20 parts to do this at our church
[1:19:03] i'm trying to do it in two here
[1:19:05] so i told brother it made me a nervous
[1:19:07] wreck i told him i've been more nervous
[1:19:08] with this than i've ever preached here
[1:19:10] because you hate to leave people lie
[1:19:11] hanging do you understand what i'm
[1:19:12] saying
[1:19:13] because as ministers we don't want to do
[1:19:15] that
[1:19:16] we want to absolutely show them these
[1:19:19] mysteries that's been given in this hour
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:22] that's what we want to do we want to
[1:19:23] preach the mysteries don't you exactly
[1:19:25] but boy if you preach the mysteries the
[1:19:27] message preachers get mad at you now
[1:19:30] they think you know it all
[1:19:32] i had one guy say i'm going to say who
[1:19:34] said oh brother samuel cabbage down on
[1:19:36] daniel 70 weeks
[1:19:39] i said really you think that yeah i said
[1:19:41] have you went out to his internet site
[1:19:42] and seen what he's preaching yeah
[1:19:44] he looked at me kind of funny i said go
[1:19:46] look at it i did the other day
[1:19:48] i said he's been preaching on revelation
[1:19:49] the book of symbols he's been preaching
[1:19:50] on predestination he preached a half
[1:19:52] year on another series he did i said
[1:19:55] when has he been preached on daniel 70
[1:19:56] weeks right
[1:19:57] if he's cabbage down on it why wouldn't
[1:19:59] he just name him okay daniel 70 weeks
[1:20:03] that was the dumbest statement i've ever
[1:20:04] heard i looked at him i said do you
[1:20:05] really believe that
[1:20:07] i said you need to go look at his
[1:20:08] internet site and the guy's eyes change
[1:20:10] i can see him change
[1:20:12] because i told him the truth
[1:20:14] that's what they heard somebody say
[1:20:16] right exactly and i'll be honest with
[1:20:18] you i've had preachers come to me and
[1:20:19] talk about preachers say well this
[1:20:20] preacher i said can you get the cd
[1:20:23] yeah i said would you send it to me you
[1:20:24] know what one of them sent me a cd yet
[1:20:27] i will not take a word against a
[1:20:29] preacher from another person
[1:20:32] i gotta i gotta grind it up my own
[1:20:34] grinders i want to hear it for myself
[1:20:36] right if somebody says he said something
[1:20:38] then you let me hear it
[1:20:39] i always say i look them i said can you
[1:20:41] give me the cd they say yeah i said
[1:20:43] would you send it to me three of them
[1:20:44] i've done that dude i haven't walked out
[1:20:45] one yet
[1:20:48] i'm not interested in their opinion
[1:20:51] you see what i'm saying
[1:20:53] well there's some
[1:20:55] that's
[1:20:56] do i got till 12
[1:20:58] okay boy you got me messed up now
[1:21:02] i knew the pressure to come i didn't
[1:21:03] know it'd be today
[1:21:06] but it talks about you know pharaoh put
[1:21:09] an edict forth that all
[1:21:10] the children israel the men child that
[1:21:12] were born were to be killed is that
[1:21:13] right right
[1:21:15] everybody agree with that sure
[1:21:19] and they did and brother am typed to
[1:21:20] this today in chicago
[1:21:22] he said one month 25 000 abortions are
[1:21:25] done
[1:21:26] do you know what they were really doing
[1:21:28] back then they were aborting children
[1:21:32] in that exodus do you agree
[1:21:34] they they would take the children they'd
[1:21:36] smack their head against wall and throw
[1:21:37] them to the gators
[1:21:39] this is the hour of abortions does
[1:21:41] everybody it's it's showing you in the
[1:21:43] scripture we're at a time of an exodus
[1:21:45] now you've got to admit it's true
[1:21:48] abortion's everywhere is that right
[1:21:51] then we go on and read we see where
[1:21:53] pharaoh's daughter do you know in
[1:21:55] chapter one at the end of it i think it
[1:21:57] is he says that all the male children
[1:21:59] they were born to the israelites because
[1:22:00] the midwives wouldn't kill them
[1:22:02] right
[1:22:04] they wouldn't do it they said we're
[1:22:05] doing that but what they did they said
[1:22:08] all the children all the israelites or
[1:22:09] all the egyptians
[1:22:11] if they got a male child is born kill
[1:22:12] them
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] so pharaoh's daughter's out bathing in
[1:22:16] the nile river
[1:22:18] a baby comes up there
[1:22:21] right they heard a cry
[1:22:22] she sent one of the maidens out there
[1:22:24] one of her servants to go get it she
[1:22:26] brought it back and that is that
[1:22:28] pharaoh's daughter looked at that baby
[1:22:30] and said this is one of the hebrew
[1:22:31] children
[1:22:34] and pharaoh had already commissioned
[1:22:37] every one of them to kill them
[1:22:39] but it said pharaoh's daughter had
[1:22:41] compassion on that baby
[1:22:43] and raised the baby as her own do you
[1:22:44] know she if pharaoh would have known
[1:22:46] darrell would have killed her
[1:22:49] does everybody understand that she said
[1:22:51] oh this is one of those hebrew children
[1:22:54] you know what i believe her name's on
[1:22:55] the book of life
[1:22:57] i said that here when i preached the
[1:22:59] other day the preacher said well that's
[1:23:00] your opinion i thought it is my opinion
[1:23:03] you know what you say where do i get it
[1:23:05] brother and said those who are good to
[1:23:06] the bride
[1:23:08] their name won't come off the book of
[1:23:09] life is that right amen
[1:23:11] that little girl favor you mean god had
[1:23:14] somebody on a book of life stuck right
[1:23:16] under pharaoh's nose i believe it
[1:23:19] she loved that little she said she had
[1:23:20] compassion do you think she won't get a
[1:23:22] reward for that
[1:23:24] she raised and looked over that little
[1:23:26] baby for how many years
[1:23:29] i in my and i might when i seen that i
[1:23:32] something spoke to my heart and said
[1:23:33] that's the book of life right
[1:23:34] so who you know you better be careful
[1:23:36] with your badmouth one thing i've
[1:23:38] learned about the book of life there's
[1:23:39] people out there in the church world
[1:23:41] justified and sanctified some of them
[1:23:45] you better be careful who you put your
[1:23:46] mouth on brother brandon said at the
[1:23:48] white throne judgment multitudes of them
[1:23:50] will come up there
[1:23:52] am i saying if you belong to a dominance
[1:23:54] church you're just no i'm saying there's
[1:23:55] brother bram said there's christians
[1:23:57] everywhere he said there's christians
[1:23:58] don't even go to church
[1:24:00] let's quote isn't it
[1:24:02] so i'm not here to judge that all i'm
[1:24:04] telling you is there's a group of people
[1:24:06] that's going on in exodus who got all
[1:24:08] they got to profit they got
[1:24:10] predestination
[1:24:12] they got the book of life figured out
[1:24:14] does everybody understand that
[1:24:17] and it goes on to chapter four there's
[1:24:18] twice
[1:24:19] where you know what he said to moses
[1:24:22] he said you know what moses i'll put
[1:24:24] words in your mouth does that sound like
[1:24:26] the third pool to you
[1:24:27] you speak it i'll perform it
[1:24:30] it ain't you speaking it's him speaking
[1:24:32] amen you really started understanding
[1:24:34] the third pool it ain't
[1:24:35] i'm gonna give you something before this
[1:24:37] morning think about chew on
[1:24:39] i had a guy that came to my church
[1:24:41] or it wasn't my church then it was a
[1:24:43] deacon then we went out to wendy's to
[1:24:45] eat one day
[1:24:47] and i got a chicken i like that spicy
[1:24:48] hot chicken you know number six
[1:24:52] so i had that
[1:24:54] and this guy stood up and said you know
[1:24:55] one day brother claude we'll speak a
[1:24:56] chicken sandwich into existence there's
[1:24:59] something inside of me and it didn't
[1:25:00] come from here
[1:25:02] or my spirit realm
[1:25:03] this came from way down
[1:25:05] and this voice said to me he's yet
[1:25:08] carnal
[1:25:10] see we talk about that in third pool
[1:25:11] it's gonna be different what you think
[1:25:13] right exactly
[1:25:15] exactly right
[1:25:18] ain't some hatched-up idea you got right
[1:25:22] god's gonna speak it through you is what
[1:25:24] it's gonna be that's what the third bull
[1:25:26] is all about
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:28] in chapter 4 you go look at it it says
[1:25:30] moses i want you to teach them
[1:25:32] but i'm going to speak through you is
[1:25:34] what i'm going to do
[1:25:36] does everybody understand that
[1:25:38] right
[1:25:39] brother god performed the opening word
[1:25:41] with brother bran and brett brown was
[1:25:42] just a microphone
[1:25:45] god spoke through him
[1:25:48] brother bannon was so consecrated where
[1:25:50] the third pool could work in his life
[1:25:52] i'm going to ask you guys something are
[1:25:53] you concentrating enough where it's
[1:25:54] going to work in your life
[1:25:56] because there's come in an hour soon
[1:25:58] that you're going to need it
[1:26:01] it soon appoints people it's going to
[1:26:04] happen quicker than you think
[1:26:06] and you better be ready for this thing
[1:26:07] you better understand the mysteries
[1:26:10] you better understand them right because
[1:26:12] it's going to come in real handy when
[1:26:13] the pressure comes down
[1:26:16] it really is i'm just warning you and
[1:26:18] i'm going to talk about seven to really
[1:26:20] bear it down for you
[1:26:22] but so teaching's a big part of the
[1:26:24] redemption of the exodus does everybody
[1:26:26] agree with that right
[1:26:28] and there were plagues involved in it do
[1:26:30] you understand the children of israel
[1:26:31] there were ten plagues three of plagues
[1:26:33] fell while israel was in egypt
[1:26:36] did you know in 1918 brother braham said
[1:26:38] influenza was one of the plagues
[1:26:41] in the scripture in revelation it says
[1:26:43] the seven last plagues
[1:26:45] is that what it says
[1:26:47] in the in the exodus then there were ten
[1:26:49] flags three of them fell while they were
[1:26:51] there
[1:26:52] you understand
[1:26:53] the seven of them fell when they were in
[1:26:55] the ocean when they were separated right
[1:26:58] right
[1:26:58] so you need to understand what scripture
[1:27:00] says plagues are falling now people
[1:27:03] i'm going to tell you the plagues are
[1:27:04] falling now we're going to see some of
[1:27:06] them but we ain't going to see those
[1:27:08] those bad ones that are coming down
[1:27:10] those two prophets that go to israel
[1:27:11] going to call them down on the gentile
[1:27:13] people
[1:27:14] i understand what those plagues are
[1:27:15] they're going to call them down does
[1:27:17] everybody agree brother bam said it
[1:27:19] those two prophets said go to israel
[1:27:21] what what did moses do he called the
[1:27:23] plagues down on egypt
[1:27:25] god's going to send moses and elijah to
[1:27:27] the jews
[1:27:29] and moses is going to call the plagues
[1:27:30] down on the gentile people
[1:27:32] while god's trying to steal 144 000 is
[1:27:34] that right
[1:27:36] that's what he says in daniel 70 weeks
[1:27:37] don't he say it exactly what do these
[1:27:39] guys do with those quotes i haven't
[1:27:41] figured it out yet do you
[1:27:47] what i really wanted what i wanted to
[1:27:48] get to today i want you guys to go to
[1:27:50] the those five books start reading them
[1:27:53] and you're gonna you if you get it right
[1:27:55] the mystery of them you're gonna
[1:27:56] understand we're in that hour of
[1:27:57] redemption
[1:27:58] right we're on a journey
[1:28:00] we're well to the end of it now can i
[1:28:03] say it that way exactly
[1:28:06] we're well to the end of it
[1:28:10] i really didn't talk about third pool
[1:28:11] much that's what i want to talk about
[1:28:13] this afternoon
[1:28:14] we were at the ministers meeting
[1:28:15] yesterday and they said okay what do you
[1:28:17] guys want to talk about
[1:28:18] and the guy said well
[1:28:20] they said well one that i man i thought
[1:28:22] why do they want to know about that one
[1:28:23] did you understand that first one they
[1:28:24] had
[1:28:25] it's like wow i don't know what that's
[1:28:26] got to do but anyway and they had
[1:28:28] another one and brother raised and said
[1:28:29] well i want to talk about the third pull
[1:28:31] the plan and purpose that's what i'm
[1:28:33] going to talk about this afternoon
[1:28:36] somebody said something yesterday that
[1:28:38] really startled me they said today
[1:28:41] remember it was 50 years ago
[1:28:44] right
[1:28:47] i believe it's right i don't know
[1:28:48] somebody said it so i have a very his
[1:28:50] souls were in prison was preached
[1:28:55] i think it's time for the third pool to
[1:28:57] start working amongst this
[1:28:59] the preacher said it's the season of the
[1:29:01] third pool i believe it
[1:29:05] it's already been working in us
[1:29:08] you go look at the quotes brother brahm
[1:29:09] said it
[1:29:11] it really is right
[1:29:13] i'm gonna stop there i got 10 minutes
[1:29:14] but i'm going to leave you but i just
[1:29:16] want to let you know
[1:29:18] that a big part of redemption
[1:29:20] let me not let you go yet let me read
[1:29:21] let's go to malachi 4. would you do that
[1:29:23] please
[1:29:25] you know what upsets me so bad is a man
[1:29:27] could be in the message for 40 or 30 or
[1:29:29] 40 years
[1:29:30] and deny that brother branham was a
[1:29:32] prophet okay
[1:29:34] i just don't get
[1:29:35] it i can't even go there i can't even
[1:29:38] can you
[1:29:39] if i try to put myself in another guy's
[1:29:41] moccasins like brother brahm said i
[1:29:43] can't go there folks i'm sorry i just
[1:29:45] can't
[1:29:47] let's read malachi 4.
[1:29:50] for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:29:52] burn as an oven and all the proud yea
[1:29:55] and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:29:57] stubble
[1:29:58] and that that in the day
[1:30:01] that cometh shall burn them up saith the
[1:30:03] lord of hosts and it shall leave them
[1:30:05] neither root or branch
[1:30:07] remember what i said about that pool of
[1:30:09] discernment what it was
[1:30:11] sodom burn up right so this messenger of
[1:30:14] malachi 4
[1:30:15] this elijah i'm going to tell you who he
[1:30:17] is william marion branham
[1:30:21] after he ministers this thing's going to
[1:30:22] be burnt up
[1:30:24] and we have a sign that was given that
[1:30:26] has a voice that that melchizedek sign
[1:30:27] was given in this hour
[1:30:30] right
[1:30:32] but unto you that fear my name
[1:30:36] now if you go to chapter six and i don't
[1:30:38] know if you know this i gotta hurry i'm
[1:30:40] gonna finish it 12.
[1:30:41] if you go look at the the exodus out of
[1:30:44] israel
[1:30:46] in six before 6 6 about 6 3 it says i'm
[1:30:49] going to give you a name and it's going
[1:30:50] to be jehovah
[1:30:52] is that what he said
[1:30:54] now that name jehovah was only mentioned
[1:30:56] once in the scripture before and that
[1:30:58] was in abraham's time
[1:30:59] and he was known in part under abraham
[1:31:02] who abraham was a type of justification
[1:31:05] is that what brother anderson
[1:31:06] he knew him as jehovah jireh the
[1:31:08] provider right right
[1:31:10] but he never knew
[1:31:12] jehovah is fullest of redemption
[1:31:15] when you go out there and you look it's
[1:31:17] capital j e h o v a h
[1:31:22] jehovah was known in the fullness of
[1:31:24] redemption
[1:31:26] and moses preached it did he not did
[1:31:28] they have healing
[1:31:30] sure he said i am the lord thy god that
[1:31:32] healeth all thy disease was he their
[1:31:33] banner yes
[1:31:35] he was the
[1:31:36] so in that first exodus what was god
[1:31:39] showing the fullness
[1:31:41] of redemption
[1:31:43] does everybody understand that right by
[1:31:45] the very name jehovah alone he's showing
[1:31:47] the full seven redemptive names of
[1:31:49] jehovah
[1:31:50] whereas he never displayed that in the
[1:31:52] old testament before then right
[1:31:54] but during the time of the exodus god
[1:31:56] absolutely reveals himself as jehovah to
[1:31:59] him he even said my name's jehovah
[1:32:01] does anybody know jehovah there's no i'm
[1:32:03] going to say this it's going to blow
[1:32:04] your mind a little bit there's no such
[1:32:06] word as jehovah
[1:32:08] the vows were added so you could say it
[1:32:12] you know that exactly you click on the
[1:32:14] word in jehovah in the bible they say
[1:32:16] you couldn't say jehovah he would take
[1:32:18] the vows out j what is it j
[1:32:21] h
[1:32:21] v h v did anybody say that
[1:32:24] i challenged everybody in my church they
[1:32:25] couldn't say it either
[1:32:27] right
[1:32:28] right
[1:32:30] the name wasn't really fully they knew
[1:32:32] the redemptive part of it
[1:32:34] does everybody understand that it is in
[1:32:36] the redemptive plan he displayed himself
[1:32:38] as healer
[1:32:40] as as jira
[1:32:42] when they needed quail did he provide
[1:32:44] quail
[1:32:46] so as that exodus there was a fullness
[1:32:48] of redemption that was revealed to these
[1:32:50] people
[1:32:51] and i think people come and say well
[1:32:52] it's jehovah witness it's got to be
[1:32:54] jehovah not jesus jehovah's not even a
[1:32:56] name
[1:32:57] it's a name but they couldn't say it
[1:32:59] right
[1:32:59] exactly
[1:33:00] right
[1:33:02] but this hour in in 117 and matthew when
[1:33:05] he was born in his name she was going to
[1:33:06] be called capital j e
[1:33:08] s-u-s now we know well we know the name
[1:33:13] that's why brother branham could tell us
[1:33:14] in this hour
[1:33:16] we have the fullness of redemption with
[1:33:18] a name
[1:33:19] no other names higher in heaven
[1:33:21] whatsoever you ask in my name it shall
[1:33:23] be given unto you
[1:33:25] there's no doubt in that that's faith
[1:33:27] buddy in that name
[1:33:29] right
[1:33:30] so we have been delivered in this hour
[1:33:32] they had jehovah we got jesus jehovah
[1:33:34] the old testament is jesus the name
[1:33:37] it's showing you we're going out on an
[1:33:39] exodus the very revealing of that name
[1:33:42] in its fullness
[1:33:44] shows you we're right in a rapture state
[1:33:46] in an exodus right okay
[1:33:49] let's read on with malachi here
[1:33:52] front you that fear my name shall the
[1:33:54] son of righteous arrive with healing in
[1:33:56] his wings right so when healing strikes
[1:33:58] the earth what does it mean restoration
[1:34:00] this prophet will be a restoration
[1:34:02] prophet amen okay
[1:34:06] excuse me
[1:34:07] and you shall go forth and grow up as
[1:34:09] calves of the stall
[1:34:10] and you shall tread down the wicked
[1:34:12] i like that right
[1:34:14] says ye that's you guys
[1:34:16] shall tread down the wicked for they
[1:34:18] shall be ashes under the soles of your
[1:34:19] feet in a day that i shall do this saith
[1:34:21] the lord of hosts
[1:34:23] and i like this 4 4 remember ye the law
[1:34:25] of moses
[1:34:26] you know there's two parts that this
[1:34:28] messenger are supposed to do
[1:34:29] return your faith back to the apostolic
[1:34:32] fathers exactly do you know what the
[1:34:34] faith the apostolics and fathers were
[1:34:35] the law right
[1:34:38] you ever think of that that's all they
[1:34:39] had was law
[1:34:41] right
[1:34:42] jesus said i didn't come to do away with
[1:34:44] the law i came to fulfill the law
[1:34:47] jesus christ that body manifested in the
[1:34:49] flesh was the fulfillment of all that
[1:34:50] the prophets he spoke
[1:34:52] isaiah 946 isaiah 7 14 was he
[1:34:57] he was the fullness as i said of the
[1:34:59] godhead bodily amen
[1:35:01] so you see every time there's an exodus
[1:35:02] there's a fullness that comes forth amen
[1:35:05] jehovah was known in the fullness under
[1:35:07] that right if you go read that it said
[1:35:09] now they didn't know me before is
[1:35:11] jehovah
[1:35:13] right they knew me as god almighty which
[1:35:15] was what elohim
[1:35:17] self-existing one
[1:35:19] jehovah now he was with his family
[1:35:22] he was existing where he was their
[1:35:23] healer he performed the seven redemptive
[1:35:26] names on israel you take through the
[1:35:28] exodus and prove that he performed every
[1:35:30] one of the seven redemptive names of job
[1:35:33] right right
[1:35:35] and now who do we have in our midst now
[1:35:37] jesus as this
[1:35:39] the fullness of g the fullness of the
[1:35:41] word resist exists among the bride
[1:35:44] you're not going to take redemption
[1:35:46] without fullness i'm just going to be
[1:35:48] honest with you you're not going to get
[1:35:49] back you're not going to get a body
[1:35:51] change without fullness
[1:35:53] and that's why you go to exodus and you
[1:35:55] look at it it shows you the conditions
[1:35:57] of where we're at
[1:35:59] it spells it out brother
[1:36:01] now this one says remember ye the law of
[1:36:03] moses two things brother bran is
[1:36:05] supposed to do return our heart back to
[1:36:06] the apostolic fathers the law all right
[1:36:10] go to any nominal church
[1:36:13] huh
[1:36:14] and i read to you and i told that this
[1:36:16] morning from deuteronomy 22 5 1 8 was
[1:36:18] supposed to wear that pertaining to a
[1:36:19] man
[1:36:20] and a pants were entertained to a man i
[1:36:22] don't care what you say they'll say make
[1:36:24] girls pants well
[1:36:26] go go to the bathrooms in walmart does
[1:36:28] it show a woman with a dress on her
[1:36:29] pants
[1:36:30] there's a reason for that
[1:36:33] that's not an accident right
[1:36:35] that's right right
[1:36:37] i don't believe in unisex i'm sorry i
[1:36:40] don't
[1:36:42] me and my wife are quite different trust
[1:36:44] me
[1:36:46] i told the church the other day i
[1:36:47] figured out what 50 50 was
[1:36:50] 50 of the time you're happy and fifty
[1:36:52] percent of time you're mad in a marriage
[1:36:55] they all laughed they said i don't think
[1:36:57] you got it yet i said well i thought i
[1:36:58] might have it
[1:37:02] but the 50 that's good is real good
[1:37:04] sister
[1:37:07] when you get 50 that's good it's way
[1:37:09] good
[1:37:10] it makes up for the 50 bad
[1:37:13] so you got to remember the law of moses
[1:37:15] is that right right
[1:37:17] that's what he did that's what brother
[1:37:18] amy he took us back to the what the
[1:37:20] faith of the apostolic the law
[1:37:23] see we didn't this church does anybody
[1:37:25] here do away with any of the law of the
[1:37:26] old testament
[1:37:28] no we fulfill it
[1:37:30] right
[1:37:32] we fulfill the is what we do that's what
[1:37:34] jesus did the second thing he was
[1:37:36] supposed to do
[1:37:37] right
[1:37:39] is what to reveal the thunders that were
[1:37:41] contained under the seal and this is
