TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Luke 17 6. says Jesus said the Lord the Lord said if he had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say unto this sycam entry be thou plucked up by the root and beat our planet and the sea and it should obey you now to think about that this morning that that really God's looking for some good ground to plant his word in somebody to just take his take the word and believe it just like planting a little small something as small as a mustard seed that's just pure nothing mixed with it won't mix with anything else but if you just have some Faith something's going to happen as we as we've been studying out looking at Abel how he brought his faith and brought a sacrifice and God God came on the scene with us in a supernatural way and proved that his faith was correct and and as we study these things out going through the book of the the chapter chapter 11. that's really you you you come to God with faith believing what he said believing what he promised and God will come behind and vindicate it and prove I'm in the message expectation brother Brown said you know some people has great big Faith like that they can be healed in a moment some has faith that much can be healed in a week some has Mustard Seed Faith takes them a long time but just follow it it's genuine it'll bring you to the light just hold on to it and keep moving and it'll bring you out you just keep holding on to that Faith it'll bring you through if it's real mustard seed you know mustard don't mix with nothing it's genuine you can mix kale with spinach and so forth but you can't mix mustard with nothing mustard stays mustard I ought to think that this morning that if you have faith you just stay with it don't mix it with any doubt or anything and it's going to produce and to think that we've got promises like that we can grab a hold too and you if you need healing or salvation or that's refilling this morning you come believing and God will give it to you Lord Jesus we're so grateful this morning to be able to gather around your word and we just ask the Lord that you'll just bless our little study this morning as we prepare our hearts Lord to receive the main course we ask the Lord that you'll just be with Brother Willie as he's studying and preparing Lord God prepare our hearts Lord prepare the ministry prepare everything this morning Lord Jesus you'll just feel at Liberty to help us this morning we ask it in your name amen so we got to Hebrews 11 verse 4 that says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yes speaketh now brother Brown would say in the message presuming he'd say you know we've been kind of looking at the comparison between Cain and Abel and he said how did Cain when he made an altar just as pretty or prettier than Abel's he offered fruits he gave his tithes he brought his income into the house of the Lord he knelt on the altar he bowed himself he prayed he worshiped just as sincere as any man but God Vindicated Abel by consuming his sacrifice oh you look at it can't just come with an intellectual understanding but Abel brought something based on a revelation you see when you come to God with faith with a revelation with with a real genuine faith God will come behind it and vindicate it supernaturally God will vindicate real super real genuine Faith by changing your life by filling you with the Holy Ghost by healing Your Body by he's going to vindicate our faith in a body change by changing her body because we believe in a supernatural God that will come behind Supernatural Faith that's given by a supernatural God and do something and the angel of God message brother around said now if I make these statements and there I just make them myself there's nothing of that happen then don't believe it because my words will be untrue anybody can make a statement but when it's a real genuine Faith something's going to happen but if I make up those statements and God backs that up then that's God's testimony to it is that right that's God's testimony only saying that it is true well then if God says it's true and confirming the word with signs and wonders following isn't that what you prayed for for years see we're comparing that with what what happened with Abel's with Abel because we read the quote last time about how brother Brown said that God confirmed Abel's faith is Sacrifice by consuming the sacrifice with fire compare that with the new birth that when you believe God will give you the Holy Ghost and Fire that which you can run it all the way down through the scriptures how all the times that God Vindicated Faith by consuming it Gideon sacrificed Solomon's sacrifice Moses sacrificed all the way down to the scripture because he's the same yesterday today and forever he comes and vindicates it supernaturally so that is that is God's testimony backing up God when we will come we'll come with our confession saying well Lord I believe your word but then God comes and when God speaks he'll speak through your life lived voices God God uh given you a testimony that speaks louder than any any sermon that could be preached but God speaks it's a testimony a supernatural testimony of vindication of your faith and brother man will say you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ accept him as your personal Savior and then receive the Holy Ghost and until you receive the Holy Ghost God has never recognized your faith and another place he said now you're a Believer but God doesn't recognize your faith until he proves it to you it might be recognized in your own thoughts but when it comes into God's thoughts God seals that Faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and another place he said that's the same thing it is when God recognizes your faith and he cuts the world off of you and give you the Holy Ghost and you really believe God then for whatever he says oh you see when God comes and testifies that your faith is real then something Supernatural is taking place and I will restore brother and said now look what Cain done when he's seen his brother was accepted his brother had this Supernatural Revelation that's what we're believing here this morning for isn't it something Supernatural a supernatural testimony from God a supernatural God speaking back in a supernatural way and then that made Cain jealous then he was jealous over him and sought away to kill him and what is Supernatural Supernatural is a manifestation or event attributed to some Force Beyond scientific understanding of the laws of nature it's something Supernatural happened when God gets a hold of a man that's stubborn and and uh got a hard heart and can soften them up to where they want to come to the Altar and give their hearts to God is something Supernatural when God begins to change your life so he ain't the way that you used to be something Supernatural when God can take a somebody that's sick and got problems with their bones and problem ailments and and God can raise that person up and cast out the cancer something Supernatural when God comes behind your faith and proves that you really believe God I got to read and the faith is the substance uh last night just kind of preparing that you think about what faith will do brother Brown said if you he said I I know I got my pocket knife in my pocket but if it ain't there faith will put it there you think about the power that's behind Faith a real Revelation from God faith will change things right my brother around was like he said some more things that I got written down he said he'd give always His prophets the supernatural sign to vindicate that it was God and them for there cannot be the presence of God without Supernatural things happening never did Jehovah ever appear without the supernatural following him it has to be so he had always Vindicated himself that he was with these prophets by confirming what they were prophesying of if it was according to his word and another place he said there's always been signs and wonders that vindicate his presence no matter what you think about that this morning why do signs and wonders follow them that believe because if the word is planted all these promises that are laying here in the Bible where if he said he'd he'd he'd cover over your your sin and he'd said he'd heal you and he said he'd change you and all these things when when that word is planted in your heart and it comes up it's a supernatural sign that the things that God promised are true that he's going to keep his word that he's going to back it up you believe leave God's word and see if he don't come and back it up and God have indicated Jesus Christ by signs and wonders there's another another thing that brother Brown said he said he have Vindicated Israel by Supernatural signs and wonders he have Vindicated his church all the way through by signs and wonders watch here now in this last day and another place he said brother God has always Vindicated his church with signs and wonders from Genesis to going out of Revelation no matter what their teachings being God has always hung that Pillar of Fire over the Israelites he was with Jesus Christ he with the church here he was with the disciples God proven his word all the way and does God ever change his mind about his word he said notice it's always caused the natural to hate the spiritual it caused Cain to hate Abel it caused Coral to hate Moses it caused Judas to hate Jesus and on and on it goes It causes the naturals to hate the spiritual Justice Cain at the beginning hated Abel the one that God received the Sacrifice from and tries to destroy them even they try to destroy the influence they try to destroy everything because it's nothing but jealousy it started in Cain and proved that it was jealousy and is still the same today when the natural the carnal and the spiritual meet together it proves it's Satan no other way because jealousy comes from Satan and then causes an impersonation of the truth somebody to try to impersonate something that isn't they are not ordained to do how much of that have we seen in the last days oh my how much of it so if we're going to study study just kind of briefly the the little story of Abel that we've been kind of looking through Cain in Genesis chapter 4 verse 8 to 11 and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass oh you think about what they must have talked about many times we'll talk to somebody and when somebody when somebody begins to hear you unfold the the things about the serpent seed and so forth that's it'll stir somebody up Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth under me from the ground and then in verse 4 of Hebrews 11 by it being dead yes speak you think about that in Genesis 4 10 it says what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and brother Brown in the message the token he said see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had he spoke he cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed a man that speaketh better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel cannot hide can see but the blood of Jesus Christ can no you think you think about what Abel's blood was speaking that we all we all need to say we need somebody to cover us up we're all born wrong and then Cain rose up and and killed Abel and his blood was was speaking back that that what he stood for was correct you think the blood of Abel still speaks that sin is serious that we all we all must answer to God the blood of Abel still speaks that God is just and that he will punish those who sin brother Brown said the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain and the message the token he said blood speaks did we say does the blood speak can it speak the token speak yes sir if we'd look in Genesis 4 10 the voice of the blood of Abel cried out against King we find out in Hebrews 12 24 that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things the blood speaks how can the chemistry speak it's the life that's in the blood that does the speaking the soul that was in Abel it was the life that was in Christ that cries out better things than any he said it speaks and it speaks loud it's the Holy Spirit it speaks plain it tells us that the time is here when we see it where it said it was said and then we see it come back and identify what it said there's nothing else left but believe it that's right to receive it another another quote around said in the message token he said but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed it speaketh better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide can see but the blood of Jesus can so o Cain come out today if you've been a persecutor against the word and say days of Miracles has passed this thing is all nonsense and things it's crying out you see the blood of Jesus Christ cries out but there's forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it I wish we could stay a little while on that see blood speaks a better thing aren't you glad this morning that we've got a covering that we can have faith in that we have confidence in that or to think that he's saying that the blood of Jesus Christ now could cover Cain if there's any canes here this morning you've got a covering if you just accepted rolled around and said look then we realize and present the token the life it took for the token the blood speaks for us remember the Covenant blood was recognized with the token and the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign that the purchase is made for us now if you're not included in that well of course you'll never get nothing you're just walking through a prayer line walking back out walking up to the Altar and looking back walking back out but oh brother when that token is once placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you something is happening he said again in the token he said sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt and the New Testament it speaks of redemption and the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow and the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and that same blood that was shed upon the ground that called out after his dead brother or call out after his brother that killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks oh my let's let's keep going and then in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speak it Faith but brother Brown said what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God and that's how Faith Abel knew how to sacrifice what to sacrifice how to get back into fellowship with God Is by a revelation that showed him the will of God and sitting here this morning Faith a revelation from God will show you the trajectory of a life he'll show you your what your purpose of being here is for show you it'll show you faith will show you what where to where to get a job what church to go to who to marry faith will show you where where you need to go and the statue of perfect man he said all Christianity all you are all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word oh my you see think about how important the Bible is to us and how important going to church is because our whole our whole existence is based upon Faith all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word and that's how all these great soldiers of faith overcame by faith by faith anything was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God how did he please God because of his faith because without faith you can't you can't please God now you think about this Monument I got a nice little picture here looking down for at the Capstone that that wasn't put on you think about that Enoch built this thing as a monument of of Faith how to get out of here that as you hear the word your faith is built up to the point where you can begin to believe that all things are possible and the ten virgins at 104 44 000 brother Brian said oh God May someday the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God walking walking in the light with a testimony that everything that God said he did it he didn't displease him what the Lord said Enoch done it in the Easter seal he said that was a man weighed Long Ago by the name of Enoch when a new thing come along when something come along and said well now we have to go back to the old school or this that or the other Enoch walked with God whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word a walk with god what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day and when come time he was so full of that quickening power remember he had walked 500 years or more before God and not one time had he missed his word oh that's that's what God is calling to us as brother boy he's been preaching on the Statue of a perfect man and coming to a revelation of the son of man God's calling us to a place where you don't miss the word that you believe every word of God not one time did he misbehave himself he's calling us to a place where we've got the same patience and the same Temperance of God not one time did he do but kept the testimony everything that God told him to do he went and done it oh we've got to have that same testimony that when God's God calls you to repentance you do it when God calls you to baptism you do it when God says you've got to be born again you do it when God says you gotta you gotta have these virtues you do it and then you can have that same testimony that Ena can no argument about it he just went and done it no matter what anybody else thought he went and done it because he believed God he was full of that quickening power and when it come time for the old man to die God just sent down the ladder and he walked up home and the true Easter seal he said that talking about those those stones that Enoch erected they weighed tons and tons up there how they ever got them up that's still a mystery to man but they take this razor blade and can run run along and it's so honed out so perfect until you can't even put a razor blade where mortar should be now that's what God is doing to his church he's holding off the people and making it in such a perfect way that when The Headstone Christ comes it fits the building together and then a resurrection of the whole thing the church has gone up that's how Enoch went up and if Enoch went up by faith and we'll go up by faith believe in what God promised that's what brother Randall said and why I'm against organized religion he said that's the way God does the church he beats every Creed every denomination every man-made Dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you if I don't do the works of my father believe me not see well if what is purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still until you haven't got if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you ought to think about this morning that those things are required of us and Enoch had that testimony that he had done everything that God required of him no matter what you've done no matter how much you've shouted how many churches you joined how many feathers you've pinned into yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart what's he saying you can act just like Jesus you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they pull a handful of beard from one side you can turn the other cheek with sweetness see until those virtues no matter what they say to you right that's that that's that Monument out in the desert that Enoch built a monument of faith that he believed God and did everything that God required until he just walked off the Earth by faith in it this is what Paul said Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God how do you please God this morning without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you know even even when you tell your kids something if they have confidence it's such a such a blessing to see them believe what you tell them if you promise them that I'm gonna pay for your schooling and they believe you they're they're believing what you say when you tell them I'm going to do something for you and they believe that's how we please God when he said when he gives us a promise and says I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost and you battle through it like Brother Willie was was preaching about yesterday no matter no matter what the circumstances look like you believe you believe God no matter what that's pleasing to God because if if you come to God you've got to believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you got to believe that if you come with faith that he's going to back up his word you got to believe he'll reward you if you believe him oh to think about this morning if you have a need if you have a need as we prepare our hearts for the for the song service and for the word if you have a need this morning you come with faith he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and not not just seek him half-heartedly but if you'll just put everything into it like like we were preaching Wednesday night about get in the spirit if you really want something from God you begin to enter in and and think about what God promised and think about that these promises are laying there for somebody somebody's going to get these promises so it might as well be you because he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him brother Brown said and believe in God he said now if we are born of our Heavenly Father God who calls those things which are not as though they were there's got to be something in us like that see that's the reason that a real consecrated Christian that's all out for God looks to what God Said instead of what you see or feel that's the Earthly man there if we walk in the flesh we can't please God but we're not walking by the flesh this morning all we walk we're walking by the spirit we're not looking at the things that we can see with our natural eyes but we're looking by at what we can see by faith and we'll stop with as the musicians come forward he said you can't have anything from God Only By Faith by faith the walls of Jericho fell by faith Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's Daughter by faith Gideon and so and so by faith only way and without faith it's impossible to please God and if you want to please him you must come to him with faith believing his word is true so let's believe God and you'll see something happen God bless you this morning [Applause] foreign
