[0:33] before you throw in one slug from last
[0:46] time this is the last time what I'm
[0:47] talking about sheep from the reflection
[0:56] was an auditory I got a thing about it
[0:58] I'll actually paying him a compliment
[0:59] but the reason I did that I was thinking
[1:03] about you know what the fact that all of
[1:04] us as humans are sheep nature I tried to
[1:06] get that point across to y'all we all
[1:08] have a sheep nature and God intended for
[1:10] that that wasn't an accident
[1:11] you know so that we would seek Him and
[1:13] as a shepherd well when you become a
[1:15] Christians may you're like a black sheep
[1:17] because you're so hot you don't know
[1:19] what I'm talking about when you're ready
[1:20] to work with the world yes the workplace
[1:23] and schooling but and anywhere in public
[1:25] they're always a black sheet you really
[1:27] stand down so that's the point I was
[1:29] making on that but it's interesting if
[1:31] you look at that little nursery around
[1:32] says baa baa black sheep have you any
[1:34] wool yes sir yes sir three bags full so
[1:38] I thought well there's justification
[1:39] sanctification depth in the Holy Spirit
[1:40] all the other three did you think about
[1:43] it thank you bond that you put that
[1:47] black sheep in there no I was on the
[1:49] Internet
[1:57] that's all about for now we're
[2:01] gonna go back to into our lesson about
[2:03] humility for a while and I want to
[2:06] review the first few slides put in some
[2:08] new slides up and then we'll start where
[2:10] I left off last time so the objective is
[2:13] to understand what it means to humble
[2:15] ourselves before the Lord a couple of
[2:18] definitions humble means having or
[2:20] showing a modest or low estimate of
[2:22] one's own importance and then the verb
[2:24] like action is to destroy the
[2:28] independence power or will of and
[2:30] especially when emphasizes the will we
[2:32] humble ourselves about denying our own
[2:35] pleasure and our own will and seeking
[2:38] the will of the Lord Satan promised
[2:43] seven if my people which are called by
[2:46] my name shall humble themselves and pray
[2:48] and seek my face and turn from their
[2:50] wicked ways then will I hear from heaven
[2:52] and will forgive their sin and will heal
[2:55] their land
[2:56] Psalm 69 32 the humble shall see this
[2:59] and be glad and your heart shall live
[3:02] that seek God
[3:04] isaiah 57:15 for thus saith the high and
[3:08] lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose
[3:10] name is holy i dwell in the high and
[3:13] holy place with him also that is of a
[3:15] contrite and humble spirit to revive the
[3:18] spirit of the humble and to revive the
[3:20] heart of the contract ones
[3:22] well speed through these first 20 or 30
[3:25] s live really quick because I have a lot
[3:27] of sausage and there's my last lesson I
[3:29] think Matthew 18 for whosoever therefore
[3:31] shall humble himself as this little
[3:33] child the same is greatest in the
[3:34] kingdom of heaven and Matthew 23:12
[3:38] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[3:39] be abased and he that shall humble
[3:42] himself should be exalted James 4:6
[3:46] but a giveth more grace wherefore he
[3:48] saith God resisteth the proud will give
[3:50] us grace unto the humble or verse 10
[3:53] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[3:55] Lord and he shall lift you up first
[3:58] Peter 5:5 likewise ye are
[4:01] submit yourselves into the hill there
[4:03] yeah all of you be subject one to
[4:04] another and be clothed with humility for
[4:07] God resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[4:08] to the humble or sixth humble yourselves
[4:11] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[4:13] that he may exalt you in due time and in
[4:18] the Strong's definition this the gillip
[4:20] are base cast down humble of low degree
[4:24] estate and lowly as a condition lonely
[4:28] of low degree brought low with grief
[4:30] depressed lowly in spirit humble there
[4:34] are many misconceptions about what it
[4:35] means to be humble humble is often
[4:37] thought to me simple or shallow this
[4:40] common thought may lead to slothfulness
[4:41] or laziness towards God as was once
[4:45] stated by brother Dale there is the
[4:47] difference between simplicity and
[4:48] stupidity we talked about that last time
[4:53] on the contrary to humble ourselves
[4:55] before God can mean many things but
[4:57] perhaps the best summation of these is
[4:58] to submit our whole life and our will to
[5:02] Jesus Christ now how did this live in
[5:05] the other day so this is just me as a
[5:11] student I'm not anything special I'm
[5:13] just trying to basically and place
[5:15] emphasis on one part of humility so the
[5:17] best way I know to describe this is to
[5:19] break it up into three parts three types
[5:21] or three forms with humility the natural
[5:24] humility and that's like the statute man
[5:26] we've been talking about there's some
[5:27] natural knowledge or a red I guess you
[5:30] say temperance some people are naturally
[5:32] can control their temper and so work
[5:34] better than others and something will
[5:36] naturally have patience and things like
[5:38] that well there's a natural humility too
[5:40] you know some people in your life that
[5:41] aren't even Christians that are really
[5:43] humble everybody knows somebody that's
[5:45] really humble but that doesn't do away
[5:47] with the part of us still needing the
[5:49] humility of Jesus Christ we still need
[5:51] the character development the humility
[5:54] of God
[5:55] humility there's also humility develop
[5:57] during your Christian journey that's
[5:59] important that that's not exactly what
[6:00] I'm talking about today either and you
[6:04] just develop that as you go as you take
[6:05] on these virtues and the stretch
[6:07] man you begin to the agency also
[6:10] Mohammed is the attitude choice talks
[6:12] humility choose them to be humble and
[6:15] you do that several times a day every
[6:17] day maybe in time we could come up in a
[6:20] situation where you have a little bit of
[6:21] free time and you can do something
[6:22] leisurely like read a novel or read your
[6:25] Bible you know which do you give your
[6:28] time to you know you can please the
[6:29] flesh more entertaining or you can more
[6:32] you know such your affection on things
[6:34] above that's what I'm talking about is
[6:36] the attitude choice of humility and
[6:38] there's other ways to do that several
[6:40] times a day but you know that isn't day
[6:42] we think Isaiah 40:31 but they that wait
[6:44] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[6:46] they shall mount up with wings as Eagles
[6:47] they shall run and not be weary they
[6:50] shall walk and not faint this includes
[6:56] prayer or meditation certitude fasting
[6:59] studying listening and many other acts
[7:01] of love and obedience now these are ways
[7:05] we choose humility as I will say many go
[7:08] deny pleasures and self-will so things
[7:13] that appeal to the flesh temporal things
[7:14] that seem important now but don't hold
[7:18] their internal wave glory and then admit
[7:20] false and beliefs and deeds so they lost
[7:24] and it's hard for one man Thank You
[7:26] quarter brother branham and saying it's
[7:28] hard for a one for for one man to
[7:31] believe another you know it's hard to
[7:32] get no man to believe another man
[7:33] because we all have this pride in this
[7:35] sense of self-righteousness and that
[7:38] we're right and what we've always
[7:39] believed is right and it's hard to
[7:41] humble that Downing's and still now
[7:43] website this person has something here
[7:44] from the Lord so admit that you're wrong
[7:47] in your belief and and admit that you're
[7:50] wrong in your deeds when you do
[7:51] something wrong for someone
[7:52] those are both ways we choose humility
[7:55] as an
[7:56] part of our Fremont agency with my
[7:58] choice all right
[7:59] and then prefer others before ourselves
[8:02] that goes without explanation and then
[8:05] waiting on God for revelation and other
[8:07] blessings this might get touchy not my
[8:10] mom I'm not really throwing off on
[8:12] anybody of like but there's been people
[8:13] that we've all seen that have come here
[8:15] and set for just a short little while
[8:17] and then before you know they throw up a
[8:19] hand to say you can't understand
[8:20] anything brother bill says and they walk
[8:21] out the door and disgust and some people
[8:24] probably walk away and that's what I
[8:26] like to say if you don't understand well
[8:28] don't take the wraps down with you but
[8:30] you know people are a little more humble
[8:31] when they walk away bull they cut down
[8:33] and just say I'm just not I just don't
[8:34] understand and leave but to me the
[8:37] humblest thing you can do is to just sit
[8:39] and listen and if you don't understand
[8:41] just pray and ask God to give you a
[8:43] revelation and give them some time I'll
[8:45] just give brother Dale town I'm gonna
[8:47] give dog town to help you but it's prob
[8:52] - man's got a problem all over it when
[8:54] someone throws up their hands they bless
[8:55] God you can understand anything that
[8:56] this five minutes on full ministry says
[8:58] and they walk away then they try they
[9:00] tell other people
[9:01] you can't understand brother Dale don't
[9:03] you you know listen brother Dale someone
[9:05] told Gaby that you can't understand
[9:07] brother Dale he's off the word and so
[9:09] she had that free
[9:11] I guess prejudice or disposition from
[9:13] the very start when she started coming
[9:15] here that she was told by someone she
[9:17] highly esteemed the brother Dale was
[9:19] wrong so she had a lot going against her
[9:21] what does that was a lot of little
[9:22] things going against her but yet she
[9:24] chose humility she chose to be humble
[9:27] and sit and listen for a little while
[9:28] and find by she understood she began to
[9:30] understand things when she had been told
[9:32] that he wasn't even right you know so it
[9:34] goes down to we're not any better than
[9:36] the people who have left here we don't
[9:39] have any less product than they have
[9:41] we've just chose to suppress the pride
[9:42] in ourselves and and choose humility and
[9:45] say no I'm gonna listen for a little
[9:47] while safe this man because you know
[9:48] Bella Dell really late for what it
[9:50] preaches you know these powerful masters
[9:51] believe what they preach
[9:53] so it's just a matter of saying god he's
[9:54] right and you can reveal to me what you
[9:56] reveal to him so that takes humility you
[9:59] just humble yourself now it's a choice
[10:03] many people may feel that to be humble
[10:06] means that we should not study because
[10:08] we are trying to figure things out on
[10:09] our own like Eve did instead of waiting
[10:11] on God this is a misconception about
[10:14] humility reading studying and listening
[10:16] to sermons is not the way of trying to
[10:19] figure things out in your home studying
[10:21] the Word of God is actually necessary
[10:22] for us to do in order for God to reveal
[10:25] his word to us is part of our reasonable
[10:27] service and you know the scripture about
[10:32] reasonable service I read that to y'all
[10:34] last time my little best man poor people
[10:37] this is where I left off from believe
[10:39] last time so brother members or people
[10:42] Joseph and Mary both real poor and here
[10:44] there was in this little stable how
[10:45] humble God makes himself and then when
[10:48] we try to make ourselves something great
[10:49] can't you see how humble how God humbles
[10:52] himself and takes the things that's not
[10:54] that he might bring to pass his straight
[10:57] pulses how that little Jehovah legen a
[10:59] man wrapped in the cloth taking off the
[11:01] back of the yoke the neck of a yoke
[11:03] where the office had been and wrapped
[11:05] the Prince of Peace in my poor way then
[11:08] what do we do
[11:11] and this is a continuation of that if
[11:13] God can hold himself like that one week
[11:15] to be able to humble ourselves to become
[11:17] his servant if he did things like that
[11:20] can we forget our great dignities and
[11:21] things of this world and past from that
[11:23] and humble ourselves before him this
[11:25] Christmas and they show him our
[11:28] appreciation of that birth and that
[11:29] humanity by humbling our own selves and
[11:31] receiving his work no matter what the
[11:33] tradition said is his word that counts
[11:36] that's what he'll take his word in that
[11:38] home and the message locally says the
[11:42] way out is down here to hold himself to
[11:44] be exalted I hear that his awesome self
[11:45] should be abased we must humble
[11:47] ourselves not try to know too much just
[11:49] know one thing focus everything else out
[11:51] of the way looking to Christ if you
[11:52] don't know how to write your name that
[11:54] don't have one thing to do it just focus
[11:56] your heart to Christ and his will and
[11:58] watch what happens this is me how could
[12:02] God be just were failure if you made a
[12:05] Bible that could only be understood by
[12:07] smart people on the contrary it can only
[12:09] be understood by babes and that our deal
[12:12] is for joy some spirit and said take I
[12:14] think they'll follow the law of heaven
[12:15] without forbid hid these things from the
[12:17] house the wild green has to build them
[12:18] on the bags even so far so it seemed
[12:20] good in my sight
[12:25] we desire the understanding revelation
[12:27] of the seal sandwich the veil and other
[12:29] mysteries contained in the word I'll
[12:30] make this point last time just redirect
[12:32] but do we study those things how can we
[12:35] expect other Avila's mysteries if we
[12:37] don't ever read the seal book the name
[12:39] sudden week week sport and so forth your
[12:43] main gotta kind of keep going and
[12:44] revolving on those those books the like
[12:47] the the dam the dam same weeks we read
[12:49] that all the way through together and
[12:50] then we go to the seven sails and we go
[12:52] to the church a book and then we are
[12:53] back over again and just all these
[12:55] series we keep them going because we're
[12:57] doing a comic play on our field you know
[12:58] we're making things ready making
[13:00] ourselves prepared for the Lord to
[13:02] reveal it to us and that's what I
[13:03] believe in don't set the silver boundary
[13:05] donors themselves just stay in it you
[13:07] know and constantly keep reading
[13:09] now we're like a woman claiming to be
[13:12] expecting a child I made that point last
[13:14] time yeah never knowing a man we the
[13:17] bride's should not expect a new birth
[13:18] birth of the word if we don't consecrate
[13:22] our lives to God and spend time with the
[13:24] word man we must study the Word of God
[13:28] now say to me through 14 states show
[13:31] thyself approved unto God a workman that
[13:32] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[13:34] dividing the word of truth and then just
[13:39] gonna read the yellow here this is about
[13:41] the perilous sword see but bless their
[13:44] house that they see in their ear so they
[13:46] hear but he that received seed in the
[13:48] good ground see that here is the word
[13:49] and understandeth it which also beareth
[13:51] fruit and bringeth forth some an
[13:53] hundredfold some sixty and some thirty
[13:56] how would you prepare your ground
[13:58] receive the Word of God
[13:59] homely yourself by sacrificing the care
[14:02] of this world your own ideas business
[14:04] that have an ear to hear that's a meek
[14:07] humble spirit ready to listen and
[14:09] willing to admit when you're wrong now
[14:13] see
[14:17] and then Miliband on the way back he
[14:19] said now we don't have to be smart we
[14:22] don't have to be educator we have to
[14:23] believe we have to humble ourselves and
[14:26] empty ourselves for God to manifest
[14:27] itself through us empty up yourself get
[14:29] yourself all the way the biggest enemy
[14:31] you have is yourself now you believe God
[14:32] you do it now this is one of those
[14:38] quotes from one of our ministers here
[14:39] again so named that creature I think
[14:42] this gonna be pretty obvious when the
[14:44] word comes then you should say Lord is
[14:46] that in me because it hides y'all memory
[14:49] talked about that last time when you
[14:50] believe something you don't even realize
[14:51] you believe until the minister stands up
[14:54] and exposes that and you and then you
[14:56] start silhouetting you realize I believe
[14:58] that that's because it has but is that
[15:00] in me yep that's in you a preacher will
[15:03] tell you that yeah that's in you he'll
[15:04] preach a sermon and you'll go man I need
[15:06] to what move over a little bit
[15:08] hey I need to stand here and let that
[15:10] thing go away but here stands a lamb
[15:14] with a book in his hand and there goes
[15:16] the white horse right
[15:17] that's why your new birth is emotion
[15:19] important thing without the new birth
[15:20] guess what you'll thank you're right if
[15:23] you don't have the reverse you're
[15:25] automatically inclined to thank your
[15:26] riders then trying self-righteousness
[15:28] something you'll thank you're right
[15:30] saying thanks he is right you'll make
[15:32] you think you're right that's what
[15:33] that's why that the seals has to tie in
[15:37] with the statue of perfect man that's
[15:39] not the virtue of a man of a human
[15:41] that's the virtue of God that's not the
[15:43] knowledge of a human that's the
[15:45] knowledge of God amen
[15:46] that's what's got to be born in here
[15:48] anybody have a guest who said that our
[15:50] master
[15:51] but way on the first sale part to
[15:56] de-rank this was real obvious because he
[16:00] says his name right in the middle of the
[16:02] quote so I think on this one so make
[16:05] your colleague and make your election
[16:06] sure well how can I do that brother Dale
[16:09] it's just pray to God and think about
[16:12] him and listen study the word and think
[16:17] on God
[16:18] so that's brother Dale I'm calling
[16:20] chosen he is talking about making your
[16:22] calling and election sure here a while
[16:23] back I was that last middle of last
[16:27] month so I see in that it's just pray to
[16:30] God sustained Communion prayer think
[16:33] about him there's meditation listen to
[16:35] sermons and listen here study the word
[16:39] read your Bible thank on God you know we
[16:41] don't put enough emphasis I think on
[16:44] meditation meditation is really powerful
[16:46] just sitting still and just thinking
[16:48] about God and why put a time limit on
[16:51] that you know we shouldn't say well I'll
[16:52] just give God 10 minutes a day of
[16:53] meditation that's not a whole lot I mean
[16:56] get very far
[16:57] Hebrews chapter 7 brother Branham said
[17:00] therefore God reveals not to the world
[17:02] not to the psychologist not to the
[17:04] educated ministers but to the humble in
[17:06] heart has people who is make he will
[17:08] reveal these secrets of the great things
[17:10] of God to them you see it
[17:16] I here comes another one of these named
[17:22] night creatures so that's the danger
[17:25] zone right there
[17:26] all right kind of guess who that might
[17:28] be say that that's the danger zone right
[17:30] there when you come to church and you
[17:32] feel like you've done your religion
[17:34] you've done your religion for the week
[17:36] and you've gone through all the
[17:38] exercises and you've gone home and you
[17:41] say well I'm just as good as the other
[17:43] one there well there's someone else
[17:45] there that's dying to themself and
[17:47] soaking up the work and they're going
[17:49] home and they're studying when and when
[17:52] they sit in church they don't complain
[17:53] about how long the minister chrétien
[17:55] they're eating it up and that's the
[17:58] difference between carnal and the
[18:01] spiritual and that's how close it is in
[18:03] this day it's going to be so close where
[18:06] Judas was putting his arm around the
[18:08] word and saying I believe the same thing
[18:10] you do I'm casting out Devils I'm doing
[18:12] college town stuff and he's sitting
[18:14] right there among the amongst the people
[18:16] who do you think said that those two
[18:19] guests
[18:22] but above I think ya don't really
[18:28] supposed to build against this I'm just
[18:29] think eventually you know a little
[18:31] thunder you might catch the little
[18:32] phrase in there that only belongs to one
[18:35] minister like if I put up something says
[18:36] sugar tip you will know as brother Dale
[18:38] or some kind of little wackadoo that's
[18:40] weird Bob words food for God this is
[18:48] many okay all the greatest things we can
[18:50] achieve in this life required humility
[18:53] perseverance and discipline so like
[18:56] anything you try to achieve learning the
[18:57] instrument learn a certain career or
[18:59] anything that's you know really worth
[19:00] having you have to put yourself into it
[19:02] so why would they expect to give them
[19:05] any less than these to God in order to
[19:07] attain to the greatest blessing for them
[19:09] my brother Dale always says you can't
[19:10] make it so easy that people fall into it
[19:12] it's not something you're going to
[19:13] stumble into for redemption north it's
[19:15] so hard we can attain to it but there's
[19:17] a way made we just have to do our part
[19:21] and you know thankfully this is another
[19:24] ministry here and you know Saints what
[19:26] we need to do is we just need to give in
[19:29] to what he's doing don't reason it don't
[19:31] think about it your own way think about
[19:33] it God's Way look at it through God's
[19:35] eyes look at it through his word and I
[19:38] believe he'll finish that word in you
[19:40] amen and he'll finish that he'll perfect
[19:42] that word in you amen praise God now I
[19:45] believe by the way it was January 24th
[19:51] all right now these are what I call this
[19:55] place of humility we see them in the
[19:57] Bible we see them in the message we saw
[19:58] brother Branham I see him here we see
[20:00] them all around us these are pictures of
[20:02] four examples of humility that's what
[20:04] I'm talking about
[20:05] sir we're see Jesus brother membership
[20:08] week we find out that the Bible wrote in
[20:10] such common language he must have used
[20:12] the grammar that was used on the street
[20:13] talking about Jesus this just a common
[20:16] people because the boss said the common
[20:18] people heard him gladly see so many the
[20:20] intellectuals could not associate
[20:22] themselves in such a common person
[20:24] that's both withdrawals I'll get em that
[20:26] were Perriman and so forth that perhaps
[20:28] he did so it was a little too much for
[20:31] them it is yet today God humbles himself
[20:33] God his humility the manikin humble
[20:36] himself is on it rode up here that
[20:38] exalts himself is on the road down
[20:40] hallways that's Christianity humble
[20:42] yourself and if that Lockton reflecting
[20:44] us people will see Christ in you you see
[20:47] when they can see that so a draw I
[20:53] studies that work here in the Polka
[20:54] mango a drawl means speak in a low lazy
[20:57] way with prolonged vowel sounds
[21:00] we call that redneck or southern or
[21:02] whatever you'll know what I'm talking
[21:03] about
[21:04] all right well there wasn't anybody
[21:06] speaking redneck or southerner in
[21:08] Jerusalem or wherever you know Jesus was
[21:10] there was nobody would have been
[21:11] speaking like that always talking about
[21:12] anywhere you go that I know of in the
[21:14] world there's always the high-polished
[21:16] people who pronounce the words right use
[21:18] big words and then there's less educated
[21:20] people who use the draw and you know
[21:24] speak the language of the common people
[21:25] and I don't know but I would I would
[21:29] guess that Jesus would have learned to
[21:30] speak the way that Joseph and Mary
[21:32] raised him up as you know they weren't
[21:34] real high educated so he probably would
[21:36] have had some of these slangs were
[21:39] street slang or whatever you call it or
[21:40] drawers and such a way for the
[21:42] high-polish preached and think what do
[21:43] you want to hear but and you know we
[21:45] always think about the pretty Jesus in
[21:47] the movies where he's got this sort of
[21:49] you know ready please
[21:51] you know God pearly white teeth he's all
[21:53] decked out on nice and Verdi and then
[21:55] he's got this real you know like an
[21:57] English accent and some movies or a band
[21:59] or something and announces words all
[22:02] right was he would have been that way I
[22:05] don't know I mean I would have kind of
[22:06] think that he would speak more a little
[22:09] bit hunger than that and more like the
[22:11] calling people so that the people he was
[22:12] sent to would receive so you think about
[22:14] brother Brown stand up and say visions
[22:17] in the healing lines and so forth and so
[22:19] much God was used in him to where he
[22:21] didn't even know what he was saying did
[22:23] you ever notice I need those tapes for
[22:24] brother been praying for somebody and or
[22:26] or seeing a vision tell what's in the
[22:28] vision all suddeniy puts on a British
[22:29] accent
[22:30] and talks real polished and pronounces
[22:33] words right you see what I'm saying so
[22:35] God comes down and uses a humble man and
[22:37] uses his dialect his tongue his way of
[22:40] speech and that's hidden from the eyes
[22:42] of the wise and prudent people would say
[22:44] well I can't bid God he wouldn't talk
[22:45] like that I was kind of my first thought
[22:46] when I heard program pray for somebody
[22:48] and said you know that God was using
[22:50] that man like that uh-huh
[22:52] how would he be speaking that way and
[22:53] being gone but that's how God can home
[22:56] himself that is the ultimate humility
[22:59] that Jesus Christ came down in the flesh
[23:01] and did all the things that he did here
[23:03] and use the drawl the common speech and
[23:08] that's where they where that scripture
[23:09] was that brother Brennan was quoting
[23:10] that from the common people heard him
[23:12] gladly when there's a lot of these in
[23:17] the book Lamar at least displays of
[23:19] humility and Jesus said over against the
[23:21] Treasury and he held how the people cash
[23:23] money the Treasury this honors
[23:26] summarizes this this is where the dawn
[23:27] cast in the two months right humility
[23:29] that's all she actually gave all her
[23:31] living humility she didn't hold back
[23:33] anything from the Lord the two men went
[23:37] up into the temple
[23:38] Luke 1810 pray one a Pharisee another
[23:40] public and the Pharisee stood and prayed
[23:42] doesn't themselves a god I think they
[23:43] are not pets other men or extortioners
[23:45] just unjust adulterers or even as this
[23:47] public you know fact twice in the week I
[23:49] give tithes of all that I possess now
[23:51] that's not humility at all that's the
[23:53] apex of pride he's bragging about what
[23:56] he's done and then the publican standing
[23:58] afar off would not lift up so much of
[24:00] his eyes into heaven but smote upon
[24:02] breast think I'll be merciful to me a
[24:03] sinner
[24:04] I'll tell you this man went down to us
[24:05] house justified rather than the other
[24:07] for everyone that is all themselves
[24:08] would be abased and he that homes home
[24:10] with new social be exalted okay team 15
[24:17] and they brought unto Him also infants
[24:18] let's just read the yellow some for
[24:21] little children to come unto me and
[24:22] forbid them not throw such as the king
[24:24] of God verily I say unto you whosoever
[24:26] shall not receive the kingdom of God has
[24:28] this little child so no wise enter
[24:30] heaven you know a child believes what
[24:32] you tell them and they're also they're
[24:34] very meek very humble
[24:35] and so forth we have to be like children
[24:38] and they just they just believe look 18
[24:41] skipping down the yellow again now when
[24:44] Jesus heard these things he said unto
[24:45] them under him yet this is the rich
[24:48] young ruler yet like a style one thing
[24:49] sell all the house and distribute to the
[24:51] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[24:53] heaven and come follow me
[24:54] he's asking him to make the hunger
[24:56] choice in the rich young ruler wouldn't
[24:58] do it the sixth seal all this is about
[25:02] his brother Neville okay what here the
[25:05] pastor the brown Carbonite right he was
[25:07] the pastor of brown tabernacle and and
[25:10] brother brown pops about here even when
[25:11] he first come in brother Neville he's
[25:13] talking about he didn't understand the
[25:15] message then but he believed it and
[25:17] stayed right with it
[25:18] that's honor that's respect to a brother
[25:20] like that I can't say enough for him and
[25:22] now the Lord bless them so just talking
[25:26] about my example a while ago about how
[25:28] some people won't listen for five
[25:29] minutes or five months hardly but some
[25:31] of my brother Neville would just sit
[25:33] there and just listen until he
[25:34] understood that humility you suppose God
[25:37] selected such a man brother Neville for
[25:39] that special purpose because he knew
[25:40] brother Neville would reverence the
[25:42] Office of God's prophet and then the
[25:46] fifth seal this is really profound okay
[25:49] brother Branham speaking he actually
[25:51] told this story a couple years proud of
[25:53] this I don't know when this actually
[25:55] happened I think it was in 1961 it was
[25:57] laying there one morning in his bed next
[25:59] to medium heat she was still asleep and
[26:01] he brought herself up on the head of the
[26:02] bed and he said and I thought boy you
[26:05] are already 53 if you're going to do
[26:08] anything for God you better get doing it
[26:10] now right off the bat that's kind of
[26:12] loco to most of us because we know he
[26:14] had all these a compliments he was a
[26:16] major prophet he prayed for the sick and
[26:18] they were healed
[26:19] he won probably millions of souls to
[26:21] Jesus Christ and he would lay there in
[26:23] his bed and think now you haven't done
[26:24] anything
[26:25] thinking to himself you'd only done
[26:26] anything for Jesus Christ
[26:28] and talk about humility unlike that guy
[26:31] in the show a few slides ago who's
[26:33] bragging about his accomplishment
[26:34] around would actually have a lot of
[26:36] accomplishments and not even you know
[26:39] take credit for it here just sit there
[26:41] in civil order I've done anything for
[26:42] you because you're gonna be too old for
[26:45] after a while say and I thought you know
[26:48] that's right now I thought boy you know
[26:50] I ain't very far away
[26:52] I got to go pretty soon it's the best I
[26:54] say you're older than my daddy later see
[26:56] I thought I got to know the way pretty
[26:58] soon I saw it and here I ain't done
[27:00] nothing for him yet
[27:02] I thought I always want to do something
[27:03] wrong I thought I got to hurry up and do
[27:06] it if I'm gonna do it and I don't know
[27:08] how I'm gonna do it that's all you know
[27:11] right after that he went into the old
[27:13] curtain of time before arm his humility
[27:15] probably go before fall but before honor
[27:18] is humility he was honored by being able
[27:20] to go beyond the curtain of time and
[27:21] Schroeder after this the seal wasn't
[27:24] real to him so talk about honor you know
[27:26] but he was really humble right before
[27:28] these great honors and his life the apex
[27:30] of his ministry about the highest note
[27:32] his ministry and right before that he
[27:34] got so little they wouldn't count any of
[27:36] his accomplishments as being anything it
[27:39] was always kind of did more for the Lord
[27:41] I think we make it to this how about I
[27:48] was not good that long time I think we
[27:50] got to talk to this
[27:51] I won't play off a little bit of this
[27:54] story here because the story has
[27:56] humility written all over it hold on the
[28:01] same when high this boy has stepped out
[28:05] though
[28:06] the place is a rest awhile from the
[28:09] dancing got with these girls and he
[28:12] happily going out towards your crown I
[28:14] had one little girl kinda ragged looking
[28:16] and shed a dish pen full of water she
[28:20] washed the dishes and thought I never
[28:23] seen her before I wonder where she come
[28:27] from
[28:28] so he just lets it is waiting it around
[28:31] the side of the the book house where
[28:34] he'll never come back side of the
[28:35] growling Manor
[28:37] she's barefooted she spelled she held
[28:40] her head down she seen who it was and
[28:42] she was very shy she this great person
[28:47] and she was just a cousin to these other
[28:50] girls or her father was forming on this
[28:54] big armored outfit so they kept she kept
[28:59] looking down she shamed being barefoot
[29:01] he said what's your need
[29:04] she told and said why do you out there
[29:07] to the for the rest of his she kind of
[29:10] made excuses and so the next time he
[29:13] watched far again finally is sitting out
[29:17] there they all kind of carrying on her
[29:19] they eat he said on the crowd been some
[29:21] watch her come through the dishwater
[29:23] around and he watched her and he said to
[29:27] her he said you know my real purpose of
[29:31] eating here
[29:32] she said no Strato said my purpose of
[29:36] being here is hunt the one he said I

[31:20] think that a man like that anything you
[31:22] do to you she said but he promised
[31:28] that it's probably that I bleed his work

[32:15] is too sure
[32:18] this girl miss face of ultimate on the
[32:20] basis of his word that he'd be back bar
[32:26] so they got the liability but throw a
[32:30] handrail would base or rivers AHA land

[32:35] just did there not a bit of blush the
[32:37] over flower and they're waiting overall
[32:39] Vicki is probably I hear that and the
[32:41] flower that always makes me think about

[33:30] denomination's promise like that
[33:39] I'm called to prepare a place for you
[33:45] let me savor crazy but brother to eat
[33:48] right now be sealed breaking like this
[33:51] of the supernatural thing right here the
[33:55] sound makes a way into eternity there
[33:59] I'm almost an angel standing there
[34:02] saying it the legs that seven angels
[34:03] message time of the award little royal
[34:08] model in the arms of Jesus we take
[34:12] another time let's think of these things
[34:15] as may go long now
[34:17] nobody so the man in this story visit
[34:22] himself with the virgin girl because he
[34:24] found in her the character he was
[34:26] looking for that's what he came all way
[34:27] down there looking for he turned down
[34:28] those real Tonti you know real flirty
[34:32] girls and went after this one little
[34:33] girl ragged looking girl with the
[34:35] character what do you think that Lord
[34:37] has been doing with the little group of
[34:39] believers that spoken word church hasn't
[34:41] he busied himself with us hasn't he
[34:44] brooded over us surrounding us with
[34:45] science and wonders hasn't he hovered
[34:49] over us and brooded over us with love
[34:51] and grace bring us revelation of his
[34:52] word I'm not saying we're the only part
[34:54] of the bride now I'm not saying that
[34:56] you're saying we are part of why do you
[34:59] suppose he has visited himself with us
[35:00] so much what do you think he is doing
[35:02] couldn't he be making the proposal to
[35:05] you if he is making a proposal to you
[35:08] will you accept whether you become mrs.
[35:11] Jesus Christ and these are several are a
[35:17] whole bunch of quotes about brooding I
[35:18] think whether they'll talk to us alone
[35:19] a while back but it's the burning of the
[35:22] Holy Ghost is for month some people
[35:24] can't keep the victory trying to say do
[35:25] you love me but you believe me and if he
[35:28] brought me what I am without me having
[35:30] any more any choice how much more when
[35:32] they give me back my life with eternal
[35:34] life with it if I brought back to him
[35:35] and say yes Holy Spirit I don't care
[35:38] what the world says I love you I love
[35:40] you I love you oh no that cloud is your
[35:44] did show up do you know there is I
[35:47] forgot how to do like that you don't
[35:49] know anything about this cloud that was
[35:50] over spoke more Church in 2015 and you
[35:53] remember in Flagstaff Arizona this is
[35:55] the one from Flagstaff Arizona
[35:56] 1963 very 28 I know we don't follow
[36:00] signs but signs fallen believers and
[36:02] there may not even be anything to that I
[36:04] believe in it I believe the Lord was
[36:06] telling us something but I'm not
[36:07] following that problem that I'm
[36:09] believing in the revelation is coming
[36:11] forth
[36:12] there are signs and wonders all over the
[36:13] places the northern ones at the end time
[36:14] was a lot more Sanko make happen we've
[36:16] had dead rage sick healed and we've gone
[36:19] brought back and curses brought back and
[36:21] trees spoken down and all kind of things
[36:24] that have happened and those are all
[36:27] signs those are good especially notice
[36:30] them the Word of God is being revealed
[36:31] that's the birding of the Holy Spirit
[36:33] then why is he standing here hovering
[36:36] over us like that is what I'm asking
[36:38] he sent His Holy Spirit now but he's
[36:41] brooding over the place trying to bring
[36:43] us back to first to be back to herself
[36:45] to be reborn again to be sons and
[36:47] daughters of God to take God at His Word
[36:49] to believe God's Word that's another one
[36:54] about brooding
[36:58] Oh duration this is a locus arte no
[37:00] Jerusalem group so much kills the
[37:02] prophets and stones thing that are
[37:03] sending the house and what I've gathered
[37:05] together as a hand duster fruit under
[37:07] her wings and you would not hold your
[37:09] house is left unto you desolate and
[37:10] verily I say unto you you shall not see
[37:12] me until the time you shall say blessed
[37:14] is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[37:16] could the Lord say the same thing to us
[37:19] at spoken word Church he's only
[37:20] obligated to his word thus we must
[37:22] accept his word to be a part of him
[37:23] could we tarry too long in our unbelief
[37:26] and the Lord passes by he has
[37:28] long-suffering but he won't be with us
[37:30] forever today is the day of salvation
[37:31] known in that person and then Hebrews
[37:34] chapter 7 for the venison now say that's
[37:36] old people o people how oft the Holy
[37:38] Spirit would have covered you as a hand
[37:40] of a brood but you went you want your
[37:43] own way and you're going to have your
[37:44] own way about it
[37:46] that's nice magrib along so I'm going to
[37:48] cut it off but this is brother Charles
[37:50] Spurgeon we like to look up some
[37:51] Spurgeon at home every now and then and
[37:53] read and he's got a lot to say about
[37:55] humility also so maybe we'll put that
[37:57] the next time I see you sometime any
[37:59] questions I'll be upstairs
[38:09] [Music]
