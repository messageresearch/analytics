[0:13] Jesus is the light house oh and from the
[0:21] rocks of
[0:23] sin he has
[0:26] shown his life around me
[0:31] that I might clearly
[0:36] see if it wasn't for the
[0:43] liouse tell me where would this chip
[0:49] be amen let's give him a
[0:53] hand I know the rainy day everybody
[0:56] wants to sleep in and I woke up this
[0:58] morning at 7:00 and I said well I better
[1:00] get ready we're going to go do battle
[1:03] today and uh I was sitting in there
[1:05] having my coffee and brother collie
[1:06] called me and uh we had a wonderful
[1:09] conversation and he told me it was
[1:11] something kind of funny he only brother
[1:12] collie can say to kind of lighten things
[1:14] up with everybody he said you know it's
[1:16] funny he said I'm calling your brother
[1:17] Don and I'm telling you my back is
[1:18] hurting me and it's really bothered me
[1:20] and he says I always feel better when I
[1:22] talk with you he said but I know as soon
[1:24] as I do this
[1:25] and we go ahead with a day my my pain
[1:28] just goes away and I said well you know
[1:31] who's causing that he said yes so I tell
[1:34] you we all uh one of us getting older
[1:36] I'm not I'm sure a lot of you out there
[1:38] are feeling your little ache and pains
[1:40] at at 50 and 60 but I look at papa out
[1:43] there and I wonder he just keep
[1:44] shuffling One Foot In Front of the other
[1:45] moving the rocks out of the way and keep
[1:47] on moving and so if he can do it I can
[1:48] do it too cuz I know he's walking in the
[1:51] faith and that's what we need to do
[1:53] that's our shining the example right
[1:58] there amen help me
[2:01] Lord I love
[2:03] you you brought me to
[2:06] Christ God sent me to
[2:09] him I don't know where this is coming
[2:11] from
[2:14] folks I just simply want to come up this
[2:16] morning and and read my
[2:20] scripture and uh I didn't understand the
[2:22] scripture God gave me to read but once
[2:24] brother Bob started talking I said this

[2:27] it and all the way here he was showing
[2:30] me how the flame is not to hurt us it's
[2:32] to cleanse us that's what that fire is

[20:14] again today with the with the um the
[20:18] Bible study I I just can't
[20:20] steal and you count me whatever you want
[20:23] to count me but false Doctrine is false
[20:26] Doctrine if you believe that you came
[20:28] here without a free moral agency then
[20:30] that is false Doctrine they nobody
[20:31] teaches that well there are some that
[20:34] teach it but it's not true you came here
[20:36] with a free will or God is not a just
[20:39] God see it takes him away from being the
[20:41] righteous judge what's he going to judge
[20:43] if this group over here just came this
[20:45] way stamped and ready to go as brother
[20:47] brandham said God didn't put you in a
[20:49] tube and pull you through and make you a
[20:51] Christian you made a choice and then
[20:53] when at the white Throne judgment we won
[20:55] because we're bride but the choice is
[20:58] they made in life the ones that didn't
[20:59] receive the New Birth the choices are
[21:01] going to determine their Eternal
[21:03] destination but today I hope and pray
[21:06] that you've already made yours if you
[21:08] make it on this side I don't want to
[21:09] stand on the other side and have to be
[21:12] judged by my works I want to be judged
[21:15] by his Works amen also remember today

[26:16] the fire of God to burn out what that
[26:18] old part's inside of you and you will
[26:21] absolutely have the word made flesh
[26:24] inside of you all right and dwelt among
[26:26] us and we beheld his glory the glory of
[26:28] the only begotten of the father full of
[26:30] grace and truth you can have your seats
[26:31] and I'll finish reading we're going to
[26:32] try to get to through with godliness and
[26:35] get to a little bit of Brotherly
[26:37] kindness this
[26:38] afternoon second Peter 1 verse 5 is
[26:41] where we've been for those of you that
[26:43] have uh that um kind of getting in right
[26:46] in the middle of this we're talking on
[26:47] the Statue of perfect man we believe
[26:50] that the prophet of God told us that
[26:51] these things are required because the
[26:54] Bible tells us these things are required
[26:56] so it's not just something that we we
[26:57] picked up and and well you know second
[26:59] Peter sounds good I think I'll read it
[27:02] he says besides this giving all
[27:04] diligence so there must be something
[27:05] that you got something urgent or
[27:07] something that you need to be what
[27:09] diligent about add to your faith as
[27:12] we'll read in just a few minutes well
[27:13] we've read this quote over and over but
[27:15] I want you to see oh I got all Faith
[27:17] I've got faith for this and Faith for
[27:19] that brother R said faith alone won't do
[27:21] it faith alone will not do it you got to
[27:24] go on further with God sure you can get
[27:27] born again Again by faith believing on
[27:29] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[27:32] saved but
[27:34] remember I want to tell you something
[27:36] this morning you only really
[27:39] believe what you
[27:42] obey right CU I'm going to read you
[27:45] quote here in a little while brother
[27:46] Brown said I've been here 30 years and
[27:47] you women still cut your hair you know
[27:49] why they didn't believe the Bible said
[27:52] anything about women cutting hair
[27:53] exactly same way with all not all y'all
[27:56] but a lot of people does about
[27:58] church you don't obey it because you
[28:01] don't believe it and you know what that
[28:02] makes you an
[28:03] unbeliever all right second Peter 1
[28:06] verse5 say besides this giving all
[28:07] diligence add to your faith virtue this
[28:10] is an addition to and to your virtue
[28:13] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[28:16] Temperance patience and to patience
[28:18] godliness and the Bible tells us in 1
[28:20] Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy in
[28:23] other words we don't have to get a
[28:25] brother George we don't have to get a
[28:26] round table discussion going on on
[28:29] godliness no cuz without controversy
[28:32] great is the mystery of godliness now
[28:35] what was the mystery God was manifested
[28:37] in the flesh that's good enough for me
[28:39] right there all right justified in the
[28:42] spirit seen of angels preach into the
[28:43] Gentiles believe on in the world
[28:45] received up into glory and I'm not
[28:46] adding to the word of God came back and
[28:48] went into you that's the mystery that's
[28:51] the controversy that even
[28:54] maybe um people in the message have
[28:56] about how you get born born again
[28:57] there's 17 different ways no there's one
[29:00] way
[29:02] amen and we're not some special people
[29:04] now that we're born again yeah we are
[29:06] but you got to get born again first
[29:08] that's right most important thing and
[29:10] brother V said the most ill taught
[29:12] subject as I've told you many times
[29:14] before you might get saved listening to
[29:15] a tape somewhere but you will not go on
[29:19] with God you will fall somewhere without
[29:22] a five-fold Ministry all right it takes
[29:25] somebody to stand here and look you in
[29:26] the face and say hey we got issues we
[29:29] got things we have to do because that's
[29:31] what the Bible told us that is as we
[29:33] look right there in that little red it
[29:34] says plan God had a plan and a purpose
[29:37] he planned it this way but you know why
[29:39] he planned it cuz he saw it he saw that
[29:41] we would need today that we would need
[29:43] Wednesday that we would need a Bible
[29:45] study that we would need watching uh you
[29:47] know on YouTube different ministers and
[29:49] listening to tapes and reading the books
[29:52] that's the plan so he made it all
[29:54] available to us so now we have a free
[29:56] choice
[29:57] somebody ought to preach on that a free
[30:00] choice to either take it or reject it
[30:04] all right so that word controversy is
[30:08] without Strife or dispute without
[30:10] quarreling we're not going to quarrel we
[30:12] know where God is today God's not in a
[30:14] building God's not in a car God's not in
[30:16] a tree he's in human beings all right
[30:19] and we're going to talk about this
[30:21] afternoon Minister said one time I can't
[30:23] remember he was he was here preaching
[30:24] not too long ago but I can't remember
[30:26] which one said it he said he U first
[30:29] time he come in the message said he got
[30:31] the book anointed ones he said it scared
[30:33] him to
[30:35] death it should scare all of us to death
[30:39] anointed ones at the end time was a hard
[30:41] message for the prophet to preach cuz he
[30:43] had people sitting in his congregation
[30:45] that was a recipient of that they were
[30:48] anointed on their Spirit realm but it
[30:50] didn't get into the soul see that didn't
[30:52] didn't get into the new birth it got
[30:54] into the spirit realm of man and you
[30:56] know what anoints your memory reason
[30:58] conscious effects and Imagination make
[31:00] you shout jump up and down and preach
[31:02] the
[31:04] gospel right Judas did Sir cuz he was
[31:07] anointed to do that but he didn't have
[31:09] the new
[31:11] birth he actually was black in his
[31:14] soul so that's what we're looking at at
[31:17] the end time even Jesus stood up one day
[31:19] and said they'll be false Christ false
[31:21] anointed ones he said it himself he
[31:24] didn't say false Jesus is he said false
[31:26] Christ who are anointed one so we'll get
[31:28] to that this afternoon cuz I want to
[31:30] bring that in in
[31:32] godliness because Bible tells us they
[31:35] have a form of godliness but denying the
[31:38] power thereof all right so brother R say
[31:40] so for know knowledge looks back and
[31:42] says that he foresaw this and knows
[31:45] that's the reason he could tell what the
[31:47] end was from the beginning like I said
[31:49] before brother B he bring he he he
[31:51] brings a message to a group of people
[31:53] and he tells the people he says oh now
[31:54] for knowledge is not a good uh word to
[31:57] use he in other words in a mixed crowd
[32:01] Methodist Baptist Presbyterians and all
[32:03] that mixed crowd all right wouldn't talk
[32:04] about women or men or black or white
[32:06] he's talking about mixed denominations
[32:08] mixed mixed ideas uh
[32:11] controversy all right so that's what but
[32:13] he was telling he said look he said for
[32:15] knowledge is a better word to use so for
[32:18] knowledge takes it all the way back to
[32:20] the mind of God where everybody wants to
[32:22] go get in the mind of God and that's
[32:23] fine Brother R told us to get in the
[32:25] mind of God but he could tell the end
[32:27] from the beginning so he looked down and
[32:29] he saw Danny fountain's life from the
[32:31] time he was a baby till the time that he
[32:33] goes into
[32:34] Rapture knew what his choices were and
[32:37] therefore set together a plan to meet
[32:40] him one day and come and and and cross
[32:43] his path amen amen not that he was this
[32:47] great something he was eternal as he was
[32:49] a baby and he comes up and he's got
[32:50] eternal life and then all of a sudden oh
[32:52] I just realized it all the things I did
[32:55] eternal life wasn't nowhere around and I
[32:57] don't know about you but I think I'm I'm
[32:58] a member of that club all right but God
[33:01] cleaned me up God burned that old nature
[33:05] out of me and put his nature inside
[33:07] that's the new birth all right not just
[33:10] attaching his nature to us but giving us
[33:13] his nature burning the old you out so he
[33:16] could tell the from the beginning
[33:18] therefore knowing all things he could
[33:20] just do what he could just put
[33:21] everything out there all right knowing
[33:24] all these marvelous days that we're
[33:26] living in now
[33:27] and to stand and witness and see the
[33:29] things have you ever done that just
[33:31] stand and witness the things that even
[33:32] when brother Bron was in this was in
[33:34] 1962 from 62 now here it's to 2023 the
[33:38] things has transpired that brother Brown
[33:39] said it's like brother Ernie always said
[33:41] he said we've got Tom Mar's news today
[33:44] we know what's going to happen we know
[33:46] where the mark of the beast is we know
[33:49] that what communism is and not to fear
[33:51] it we know it's denominations and how to
[33:54] fear that and where Satan's seed is now
[33:57] yeah that's right all right but we also
[33:59] know the seals are open we also know
[34:01] there's a way to get out of here we also
[34:04] know we don't depend on
[34:08] death and to stand and witness and see
[34:11] the things that we've seen now God had
[34:13] to make a preparation for
[34:16] it now listen so he made a
[34:20] choice don't get quiet on me God made a
[34:24] choice he made a choice to save you he
[34:27] didn't have to God's God remember before
[34:31] all this he was self-existing
[34:33] didn't need air to breathe didn't need
[34:36] me and you to tell him what to
[34:39] do hello
[34:41] somebody but you know what he
[34:44] decided that he's going to have a plan
[34:46] he decided that he would put Adam and
[34:48] Eve in human flesh to work on the earth
[34:51] and be the god of the Earth but he knew
[34:53] when they were put in human flesh they
[34:55] were going to fall but he had attributes
[34:57] of Savior healer Redeemer all that was
[35:00] inside of him that needed and he wanted
[35:03] to express them all right so he
[35:05] expressed them by letting them fall not
[35:07] making them fall see there we go again
[35:09] with free choice Adam and Eve had free
[35:11] choice Eve could have just said
[35:14] no there wasn't some great something
[35:16] going on it just Eve could have just
[35:18] said no let me go get Adam and I'll
[35:20] no Satan being who he was knew he could
[35:24] work on her emotions right that's why
[35:28] sisters should not be preaching our Ur
[35:30] in any Authority in the church now
[35:32] that's Bible and the prophet's message
[35:33] so if you get mad at that go talk to
[35:35] them but that's just the way it is cu
[35:39] that's the plan am that's the plan of
[35:42] God Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[35:44] brother R said now God's secret mystery
[35:46] he had before the world began now back
[35:48] in the back part of God's mind know
[35:49] there's what for knowledge he fornew
[35:52] those who he forew he did
[35:54] predestinate if he didn't know you
[35:57] it's really simple you you look at
[35:59] brother Chris just explained it so well
[36:01] Sunday I know some of you thought he may
[36:03] have been a little bit off but no it's a
[36:05] masterpiece that was a way to tell it
[36:07] right there there's not a spot there's
[36:09] not a tangible something that you've got
[36:12] that somebody else don't have it's just
[36:14] a representation that you had from
[36:17] predestination as the woman at the well
[36:19] had representation see the the the the
[36:23] cus and all them they didn't have
[36:24] representation cuz God knew
[36:27] by Foreign knowledge he knew they would
[36:30] hate him they knew he would they would
[36:32] never accept him but he knew she
[36:36] would by her choice but it's not
[36:39] something tangible but you can't do away
[36:41] with the quotes you got brother Ram said
[36:42] he said you come here baby you come here
[36:44] with something in you that's a quote you
[36:47] got to do something with it though then
[36:49] he said eternal life started at the
[36:50] altar you got to do something with that
[36:51] too but you bring it all together and
[36:53] realize that brother Brandon was looking
[36:55] in the mind of God telling you what
[36:57] God's saying about you right and then
[37:00] you're over here seeing the sinner
[37:01] giving their heart to God that's the
[37:03] flesh part that's somebody trying to get
[37:07] right remember God can't change his mind
[37:10] right if he loves you in a beginning he
[37:13] always will love you can't change his
[37:16] mind so that way yeah I'll go with
[37:18] predestination or predetermine if you go
[37:20] that
[37:20] way but not that you come here and you
[37:23] didn't have a choice I just ain't going
[37:26] with that amen it's not according to the
[37:29] Bible not according to Prophet message
[37:31] right so if it's according to yours do
[37:33] you have a
[37:35] controversy and I'm really not even
[37:37] going to talk to you about that
[37:38] controversy that's just so off the word
[37:42] that we don't have any
[37:43] choice now back in the back part of
[37:45] God's mind there was something that he
[37:47] was trying and going to achieve in other
[37:49] words to make it unfold he had a motive
[37:51] in doing it what to let himself be
[37:53] expressed then he talks about neither
[37:55] moon or star let's just keep going 2
[37:58] Peter 3:14 says wherefore beloved seeing
[38:02] that you look for such things be
[38:04] diligent that you may be found in him in
[38:07] peace without spotting blameless the
[38:08] question was we can't be perfect no not
[38:11] in oursel we can't we fail every day we
[38:14] have failed by getting up this morning
[38:17] all right some of you could have had an
[38:19] argument with your spouse or even
[38:21] yourself Donnie's got his finger up
[38:23] bless your heart buddy I'm sorry you be
[38:25] all right I hope s Susan watching in
[38:28] you'll have a nugl when you get
[38:31] home sometimes it's good to just keep
[38:33] that just hold your hands down you know
[38:35] just maybe stick a finger up every once
[38:36] in a while
[38:38] but be diligent take notes you
[38:42] two
[38:44] be be diligent that you may be found of
[38:47] him in peace without spotting blameless
[38:49] the question was I you know you hear the
[38:51] people in the world I can't be perfect
[38:52] you're not perfect and I'm not perfect
[38:54] when you start talking about these
[38:55] different things that God's done in in
[38:56] your life and no you're not by yourself
[38:59] but God said in the Bible second Peter
[39:01] 3:14 says you could be found in him
[39:04] without spot and blameless the Bible
[39:07] says spot or Wrinkle in a certain place
[39:09] and account that the longsuffering of
[39:11] Our Lord there's your patience is
[39:14] salvation even as our beloved brother
[39:16] Paul also according to the wisdom given
[39:18] unto him hath written unto you now God's
[39:20] waited 2,000 years he he's no I'm sorry
[39:23] he's waited 6,000 years he walked with
[39:25] Adam and Eve and tool of the
[39:27] garden talking just like me and Michael
[39:29] are looking at each other right now
[39:31] nothing in between that's what he wanted
[39:33] or he'd have made it different right we
[39:36] got to remember that if God if that's
[39:37] the way God wrote it that's the way he
[39:38] wanted it and it's not going to change
[39:40] we've got to adhere to it his plan not
[39:43] ours but he was he would go down and
[39:45] talk to Adam say hey man how you doing
[39:47] good I'm fine yeah man we're good all
[39:49] right everything's fine I'm going to go
[39:50] back in this other dimension you take
[39:52] care of this round ball we call the
[39:54] Earth all right he can't do that now sin
[39:59] broke the picture up sin broke the
[40:03] chain everybody with me so now instead
[40:07] of being born with the nature of God the
[40:09] two Natures you're not born with two
[40:11] Natures folks you're not born with two
[40:12] Natures in your soul I'm sorry I am so
[40:14] sorry about that that's old two Soul
[40:17] Doctrine and then Satan be gives you a
[40:19] soul he's not a Creator there only one
[40:22] Creator and that's God but though he
[40:24] want God wanted you to have his nature
[40:26] the whole time yeah but when we when
[40:29] when um what happened in the garden it
[40:32] separated he had to take this
[40:35] back I hope this is for somebody maybe
[40:37] it's for me but he takes back the book
[40:40] of redemption he takes back that book
[40:43] and and coming down through time now he
[40:45] allows you to come like this you you
[40:48] come as a fallen nature right right so
[40:52] now where's this other nature at where's
[40:54] this Genesis 126 man is everybody with
[40:56] me where's this Genesis 126 man it
[40:59] didn't come with
[41:01] you
[41:03] hello we got them in the front amen
[41:05] let's get them in the back amen you
[41:07] don't have those two Natures you lost
[41:10] that one that Genesis 1:26 man never
[41:12] sinned never had a bad day never never
[41:15] even went to sleep amen but it stayed
[41:18] with God because sin was so hidious he
[41:20] said I'm going to put enmity or a
[41:23] division now Adam I can only talk talk
[41:26] to you through blood that's right you
[41:29] got to go kill an animal and he said I
[41:30] think I'll do the first one and then you
[41:32] do it afterwards so God killed an animal
[41:34] throw the skins in and said put these
[41:37] on everybody with me so that is the way
[41:42] you came you came with a fallen nature a
[41:45] soul given to you by God not
[41:48] Eternal but
[41:50] perfect and it became imperfect you can
[41:52] hear what the Bible tells
[41:54] us cuz the Bible say says being made
[41:56] perfect so if we were being made perfect
[41:59] that means we were imperfect to start
[42:00] with 1 Corinthians 1:7 so that you come
[42:03] behind and no gift waiting for the
[42:05] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[42:07] shall also confirm what
[42:09] you confirm you until the end yeah
[42:14] you you know what our problem is we it's
[42:16] like I said about the laundry list our
[42:18] problem is is well I had a bad thought I
[42:20] need to get re-baptized well I I had a
[42:23] bad this I need to get this done and
[42:25] then I need to go get this done no just
[42:27] repent just repent and go
[42:30] on the best thing to do repent and go on
[42:33] he didn't say repent he said repent
[42:35] everyone you be baptized in the name of
[42:36] Jesus Christ if you've done that you
[42:37] don't have to do that again but it's not
[42:40] that you're not going to sin
[42:43] either everybody with
[42:45] me who shall also confirm you unto the
[42:48] end that you may be
[42:50] what blameless in the day of our Lord
[42:53] Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you
[42:55] were called huh many are called few are
[43:00] chosen you were called listen everybody
[43:03] got the call of God to me that's the
[43:05] free moral agent everybody got called
[43:08] some will say yes some will say no
[43:11] pretty simple no in between no gray area
[43:14] amen you either was in the ark and lived
[43:17] or you was outside the ark and died
[43:19] righten there wasn't any that made it by
[43:23] the Skin of Their
[43:24] Teeth God is fa by whom you were called
[43:27] into the fellowship of his son Jesus
[43:29] Christ Our Lord now beseech you Brethren
[43:31] by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:33] that ye all speak the same thing and
[43:36] that there be no divisions among you wow
[43:40] we haven't got there yet but that ye be
[43:43] perfectly joined together in the same
[43:45] mind and in the same what judgment 1
[43:49] Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know you not
[43:51] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[43:54] the kingdom of God be not deceive
[43:56] neither fornicators idolators adulterers
[43:59] effeminate abusers of themselves with
[44:01] mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[44:04] drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners
[44:07] pretty bad
[44:09] group amen oh yeah that's the that's
[44:11] them people's in
[44:15] jail let's read what Paul said in verse
[44:17] 11 and such for some of
[44:20] you that kind of knocks him in the teeth
[44:23] right and such were some of you he was
[44:25] looking at a congregation
[44:26] and such for some of you but you are
[44:28] washed in other words you made a choice
[44:31] you were this before now you're this to
[44:34] me folks that's a choice and you made
[44:36] the right one but you are Sanctified but
[44:39] you are justified in the name of our
[44:40] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[44:43] Philippians 2:15 says that you may be
[44:46] how many times have we read this
[44:48] blameless
[44:50] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[44:53] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[44:55] and perverse Nation among whom ye shine
[44:58] as lights in this
[45:02] world so it takes Grace
[45:04] though it takes Grace it takes Amazing
[45:09] Grace to get us through that period and
[45:12] to get us born again it takes Grace
[45:15] that's why people that are not born
[45:16] again they're the most critical people
[45:18] in the world they don't know what
[45:20] they're talking about because they don't
[45:22] have didn't get Grace their self oh they
[45:24] didn't condemn people they can
[45:26] absolutely just run people down and
[45:28] ain't got enough of God in them to come
[45:29] to
[45:30] church well I said it anyway but we all
[45:34] need Grace everybody know Miss
[45:37] Grace some of y'all are in
[45:41] trouble Grace Grace Amazing Grace is for
[45:45] what you did in the
[45:50] past but it takes these virtues to keep
[45:53] us clean it takes these virtues cuz
[45:56] you're in your soul today if you're born
[45:57] again in your soul as brother B was
[45:59] talking about this morning in your soul
[46:01] the real you the real being that we're
[46:03] talking to today it's either born again
[46:05] or not there's not a gray area now you
[46:07] could be in justification and
[46:08] sanctification your walk could be as
[46:10] you're progressing but you got to start
[46:13] progressing do as the turtle start the
[46:17] race let the tortoise go out there a
[46:19] little bit
[46:20] further the hair is going to jump past
[46:22] him but he's going to be slow and steady
[46:24] that's the way we need to be
[46:26] slow and steady all right let's get to
[46:29] patience we talked about Temperance
[46:30] Temperance is having what power it's
[46:32] having control all right let's have
[46:34] patience now it is not in the new in Old
[46:37] Testament it's in the New Testament
[46:38] because without uh you look at Moses he
[46:41] didn't have a lot of patience you saw he
[46:43] was patient well it got him in trouble
[46:45] by not being patient he smoked the rock
[46:48] instead of spoke to it so he didn't have
[46:51] enough patience but in the New Testament
[46:54] a man who is not SW from his deliberate
[46:57] purpose and his loyalty to Faith and
[46:59] piety by even the greatest trials those
[47:02] are um
[47:04] plural and
[47:07] sufferings patiently and
[47:11] steadfast brother Brown now this is kind
[47:13] of long but I'm going to read it
[47:15] anyway does he hold back the persecution
[47:17] does he stem the tribulation no he does
[47:20] not he simply says I know your
[47:23] tribulation I am not at all un mindful
[47:26] of your suffering what a stumbling block
[47:28] this is to so many people like Israel
[47:31] they wondered if God really loved them
[47:32] how could God be just and loveing if he
[47:34] stands by and watches his people suffer
[47:37] that's what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3
[47:40] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[47:41] Israel by Malachi I have loved you
[47:43] sayeth the Lord yet we say wherein hast
[47:46] thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[47:48] brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob
[47:50] and I hated Esau now if we stop right
[47:52] there we're going to make God then
[47:54] picking and choosing but the reason he
[47:56] hated Esau was what he saw Esau give
[48:00] away his Birthright four new he had four
[48:03] knowledge that that was going to happen
[48:05] therefore he could love Jacob and not
[48:07] love Esau and listen before you were
[48:09] born he either loved you or didn't right
[48:13] but you didn't know that we're down here
[48:14] now we're in time we're in Redemption
[48:18] time we're in Grace we're not going to
[48:19] need Grace when we get to heaven we're
[48:21] not going to need faith when we get to
[48:23] heaven we're going to be faith and
[48:26] hallelujah we're going to be
[48:30] Grace you see they could not figure out
[48:32] God's love they thought that love meant
[48:34] no suffering they thought that love
[48:36] meant a baby with parental
[48:38] care but God said that his love was
[48:41] elective love the proof of his love is
[48:44] election now what is an
[48:45] election election is not you don't have
[48:48] a choice what is an election you have a
[48:51] choice you go to the poll and you vote
[48:54] cuz you have a choice chice to vote who
[48:57] you want in or who you want out
[49:00] regardless of all this other stuff that
[49:02] the Electoral College and all that stuff
[49:04] let's just go simple this God voted for
[49:06] you Satan voted against you you swing
[49:08] the vote all right it's going to be two
[49:11] to one one way or the other but God
[49:12] knows what you did or did but you don't
[49:15] all right look now watch keep going down
[49:17] through here but it's all with a purpose
[49:20] if he did not have a purpose then he
[49:22] would be the author of frustration and
[49:24] not of peace his purpose is that after
[49:27] we have suffered a
[49:30] while after we have suffered a while we
[49:34] would be made perfect be established
[49:36] strengthened and settled as job said he
[49:38] put strength in us what virtue all these
[49:42] are tied together job 23 says you see he
[49:46] himself suffered he learned obedience by
[49:48] the things that he suffered he was
[49:50] actually made perfect by the things that
[49:52] he suffered Hebrews 5:9 says though he
[49:55] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[49:57] the things which he suffered and being
[49:59] made perfect he became the auor of
[50:00] Eternal salvation unto all them that
[50:03] obey him now here's brother Brown in
[50:04] plain language the very character of
[50:06] Jesus was perfected by suffering or what
[50:09] patience and according to Paul he has
[50:12] left his church a measure of suffering
[50:14] that they too by their faith in God
[50:17] while suffering for him would come to a
[50:20] place of perfection so we can't get
[50:23] perfected without some suffering we
[50:25] can't get perfected on a flowery bed of
[50:30] e why did he want this James 1 my Breen
[50:33] counted all joy when you fall into how
[50:36] many of y'all just get up and start
[50:37] calling people said I'm just so happy
[50:39] I'm in this
[50:41] trial post it on Facebook I'm just so
[50:44] happy and big old stars going off and
[50:46] you know big heart bouncing up and down
[50:48] like some of y'all saying no when you're
[50:50] going through a trial you send that
[50:52] emoji
[50:54] that's are them other kind of emojis
[50:57] going through an issue or problem but it
[50:59] says right here in the Bible count it
[51:00] all
[51:01] joy let you fall into diverse
[51:04] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[51:05] of your faith worketh patience but let
[51:08] patience have her perfect work that you
[51:10] may be perfect and entire what wanting
[51:13] nothing don't we want that then eat that
[51:17] scripture right there right amen why
[51:20] does he stand by the reason is in Romans
[51:22] 8 ver1 17 and if children that HS HS of
[51:25] God and join ours with Christ if so be
[51:27] that we suffer with him that may we may
[51:29] be also glorified together for I reckon
[51:31] that the sufferings of this present time
[51:34] are not worthy to be compared with the
[51:36] glory which shall be revealed in
[51:38] US unless we suffer with him we cannot
[51:41] reign with him we have to suffer to
[51:43] reain the reason for this is that
[51:45] character simply is never made without
[51:47] suffering character is a victory not a
[51:50] gift a man without character can't Reign
[51:53] because power apart from character it's
[51:55] satanic in other words the power that
[51:57] we've been talking about the virtue
[51:58] without the new birth you'll use it
[52:01] wrong that's right it's
[52:04] satanic but Power with character is fit
[52:07] to rule and since he wants us to share
[52:10] even his throne on the same basis that
[52:13] he overcome and sat down on his father's
[52:15] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[52:17] with him a little temporary suffering we
[52:20] go
[52:22] through temporary
[52:24] suffering
[52:27] now is not worthy to be compared to the
[52:29] tremendous Glory that will be revealed
[52:30] in us when he comes oh what Treasures
[52:33] are laid up for those who are willing
[52:34] who are willing oh
[52:37] choice just made a choice there who are
[52:39] willing Free Will that's why I call it
[52:41] free will who are willing to enter into
[52:44] his kingdom through much
[52:47] tribulation that's your perfect man says
[52:50] and we're heading on up we still
[52:52] impatience for a little bit you're
[52:53] beginning to reflect the works of of
[52:55] Christ but so many of us try to do the
[52:57] works of Christ before the reflection of
[52:59] Christ is in us now everybody listen let
[53:02] me stop for Mee everybody wants to be
[53:04] zealous we got we you should have a
[53:06] little bit of not jealousy zealous you
[53:08] should be zealous about coming to church
[53:10] you should be zealous about studying the
[53:12] Bible you should be zealous about
[53:14] somebody that is sitting beside of you
[53:17] that's worshiping God that that feels
[53:19] the power of God maybe it's not your
[53:21] turn yet but you know
[53:22] what maybe the next time is yours but
[53:25] you're doing one thing you're you're
[53:27] you're looking and you're seeing that
[53:29] these things are happening and you're
[53:31] not being fanatical about it all right
[53:33] that's why we've seen people as brother
[53:35] R says right here he's talking about
[53:37] really some of them are the Pentecostals
[53:39] who he was preaching to during that time
[53:41] they got fanatical they run out on the
[53:42] limb and say this is it speaking tongues
[53:44] you get the Holy Ghost well you know
[53:46] that's not the
[53:47] truth we find these things happening you
[53:51] know it I know it we see these stumbles
[53:53] along the road we find the scrap heap of
[53:55] ministers Christians
[53:58] Christians not not a scrap heap of of of
[54:01] unregenerated people scrap heaps of
[54:05] Christians piled along the road is
[54:07] because they didn't go into it right in
[54:09] other words they weren't given the plan
[54:12] right ain't that what it is they weren't
[54:14] given the plan
[54:16] correctly you need to find somewhere
[54:18] where they do preach the plan
[54:21] correctly and that's why I'm here this
[54:23] morning is to try to teach this little
[54:25] church and myself how that we can become
[54:27] the dwelling place of the Living God how
[54:31] many would like to do that say
[54:33] Amen I'm not worthy well you just cut
[54:36] yourself
[54:38] off second Peter 3:9 say the Lord is not
[54:41] slack concerning his promise as some men
[54:43] count slackness but longsuffering to us
[54:46] we're not willing
[54:48] see God got free will
[54:50] too he wasn't willing that any should
[54:53] perish because because listen there's no
[54:56] way God can stand and be
[54:59] God and just say well this is it I'm
[55:01] taking this group of people right here
[55:02] and I ain't taking no more and he sees
[55:05] billions upon billions upon billions
[55:08] that Grace will cover the kids that are
[55:10] under the age of accountability put them
[55:12] in heaven come on somebody uh cup of
[55:14] water in my name the people are good to
[55:16] the bride all these different ones
[55:18] that's going to be given eternal life
[55:19] the foolish virgin the Jews that stood
[55:22] for him all those different ones brother
[55:24] R said you know K I mean not Kus but U
[55:27] see that was the difference in cus and
[55:28] Nicodemus and and Gia Gia and Nicodemus
[55:32] kind of held their their stand and said
[55:34] okay if it be of God we can't stop it if
[55:37] it's not of God it'll stop itself but
[55:39] caias wanted to kill him so you see the
[55:42] difference in the two but but Nicodemus
[55:45] and and Gia will be given eternal life
[55:47] so there's that other group standing
[55:48] there that's going to be given eternal
[55:51] life by their what choice
[55:56] am
[55:58] because
[56:00] CIA and Nicodemus were two I mean they
[56:04] were the highest ranking besides the
[56:06] high priest they were the highest
[56:07] ranking uh what whatever you want to
[56:09] call them priest popes whatever or
[56:12] Bishops or whatever you know they looked
[56:13] to Gia and Nicodemus and then there was
[56:16] kyus the high
[56:17] priest what was the difference they made
[56:19] a
[56:20] choice but so did Kus make a choice so
[56:24] what's longsuffering bear long suffer
[56:26] long be
[56:27] longsuffering patiently enduring to be
[56:29] of a long Spirit not to lose heart
[56:33] please let's don't lose heart we've seen
[56:35] people we were just um discussing some
[56:37] things me and Chris the other day of all
[56:39] the people that we've seen come through
[56:41] the message and then they just
[56:43] disappear I'm talking about
[56:46] disappear well what
[56:48] happened they lost heart they didn't get
[56:51] born again number one but had somebody
[56:54] tell them see they had somebody sit
[56:55] there and tell them well just believe
[56:56] the message that's all you got to do
[56:58] just believe the message and and you're
[57:00] saved
[57:01] no the devil believes it more than you
[57:04] do cuz he comes to church when y'all
[57:09] don't quiet if you want to but it's a
[57:13] truth to persevere patiently and bravely
[57:17] in enduring
[57:19] what Misfortune and troubles to be
[57:24] patient and bearing the offenses and
[57:26] injuries of others to be mild and slow
[57:29] to punish got you a perfect man brother
[57:32] R says virtue must be in us and until we
[57:35] get virtue when we get true virtue then
[57:37] we can add it to our faith that's the
[57:39] next foundation wall now first you must
[57:40] have faith look faith alone won't do
[57:43] it Paul gets to he says you can have all
[57:46] Faith you can have charity you can have
[57:48] all that stuff not charity you have you
[57:49] can have the Mysteries and you know all
[57:51] these things but have not charity which
[57:54] is right right there on top of the
[57:55] headstone you're sounding brass and a
[57:57] tinkling symbol faith alone won't do it
[57:59] now watch eled 1960 Abraham we find out
[58:03] didn't obey God just right now what wait
[58:05] a minute wait a minute Abraham's the
[58:08] father of our faith the foundation of
[58:11] our faith and brother R said he didn't
[58:15] obey God just
[58:18] right now he made ready and had faith in
[58:21] the
[58:22] promise but see we can still have faith
[58:25] in the promise and then not
[58:27] obey still it hinders us let me go back
[58:30] to my quote you only really believe what
[58:32] you
[58:34] obey and think about that it's true in
[58:38] everything everything even out in the
[58:41] world you know things you the choices
[58:42] the all the things you only really
[58:44] believe what you obey cuz if you don't
[58:45] believe it you're not going to obey it
[58:48] all
[58:49] right it'll hinder us faith alone won't
[58:52] work because faith without works
[58:55] is dead that's
[58:57] right brother said what patience with
[58:59] what not with your neighbor not with
[59:01] your brother not at first he said
[59:03] patience with God if you got real
[59:06] genuine faith you'll have real genuine
[59:08] patience because Faith worketh patience
[59:11] When God says anything you believe it
[59:13] that's all you got patience now how many
[59:16] of us have been through trials that
[59:19] we've had to do that we've had to hold
[59:21] on and then hold on I'm talking about
[59:23] when you get to the into your rope the
[59:25] old saying is tie not and hang
[59:27] on all right but somewhere God came
[59:31] through somewhere somehow God came
[59:35] through why because you persevered CU
[59:37] you didn't let go of the Rope at the
[59:39] top Isaiah 40: 28 hast thou not known
[59:42] hast thou not heard that the Everlasting
[59:44] God the Lord the creator of the ends of
[59:47] the Earth Feth not neither is weary
[59:50] there is no searching of his
[59:52] understanding he giveth power to the the
[59:54] faint and to them that have no might he
[59:57] increases strength thank God for a god
[59:59] like that even the you I I jury in the
[1:00:02] name of the Lord if you don't know that
[1:00:03] God today you need him cuz it's not
[1:00:06] going to get better it's going to get
[1:00:07] worse even the youth shall Fain and be
[1:00:10] weary and the young men shall utterly
[1:00:12] fall but they that wait upon the
[1:00:16] Lord shall renew their
[1:00:19] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[1:00:22] as
[1:00:23] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[1:00:27] you ought to write a song about this
[1:00:29] they shall walk and not faint teach me
[1:00:32] Lord teach me Lord to what wait oh no we
[1:00:38] want we and we do we want them all
[1:00:41] saved their time though not our time
[1:00:45] right all right that's why you give them
[1:00:48] over to the
[1:00:49] Lord but now you but now you give them
[1:00:51] over the Lord sister Regina not with a
[1:00:52] little bit string attached to it either
[1:00:54] that if something gets wrong or gets bad
[1:00:55] you start pulling no give them to God
[1:00:59] lay them on that
[1:01:00] Altar and say God whatever save my
[1:01:04] children and don't pray for it to get
[1:01:06] any
[1:01:10] better that's hard to swallow but but I
[1:01:13] believe what brother Claud said and I
[1:01:14] got to think about that I at first I
[1:01:16] thought no come on man you need to pray
[1:01:17] for your kids but if your kids if you're
[1:01:19] praying that your kids come to God and
[1:01:21] then you start praying that off of them
[1:01:24] cuz you can't remember brother Ram said
[1:01:26] he even said you could pray something
[1:01:28] off
[1:01:29] somebody be careful give them over to
[1:01:32] God if they're having trouble then you
[1:01:34] just let God handle it all right mothers
[1:01:37] remember this let God handle
[1:01:42] it I mean the men sometimes were like
[1:01:45] hey I told you and the moms are going
[1:01:47] like can't we just call them and let
[1:01:48] them come to the house one time
[1:01:51] no cut the cord
[1:01:56] let God do his
[1:01:58] work how many of you would like to save
[1:02:00] your
[1:02:02] children you just wasted your
[1:02:05] time I just wasted my time telling you
[1:02:07] that too but you sure can't pray for
[1:02:09] them you sure can say God stir their
[1:02:13] water don't let them
[1:02:15] sleep that's right Joshua would always
[1:02:18] tell us a long time ago you know and we'
[1:02:20] praying for him and he get in a car W
[1:02:22] he'd be one of the guys that'd be four
[1:02:23] guys you know at standing around and one
[1:02:25] guy throw a rock through a window and
[1:02:26] they blame
[1:02:28] Josh sometimes maybe it was him
[1:02:30] sometimes maybe it wasn't but he always
[1:02:32] got to blame and um he told us one day
[1:02:35] he said would y'all quit praying for me
[1:02:37] he said I'm having trouble at every turn
[1:02:39] in every corner I said y'all he said
[1:02:41] y'all just quit I know what you're
[1:02:43] doing that's what I want it to be I want
[1:02:45] it to be where they don't have any
[1:02:47] wiggle room they have no way out they
[1:02:50] got to come back to God not Mama and
[1:02:51] Daddy they got to come back to God
[1:02:55] amen let God take care of them and it
[1:02:59] might look bad listen if we have to go
[1:03:01] through suffering if we have to go
[1:03:03] through trials if we have to go through
[1:03:05] Temptation being child of God what about
[1:03:07] somebody that's coming to God just lay
[1:03:10] your hands off of it turn your head and
[1:03:12] say God you save me save
[1:03:16] them the trouble of it we people were in
[1:03:19] too much of a hurry yeah I want them all
[1:03:21] save it's just got to be done right now
[1:03:24] now can't come back no more and when you
[1:03:26] get that in your mind you're going to
[1:03:28] lose right there as I've always told you
[1:03:31] this is not a microwave religion this is
[1:03:35] not a microwave Christianity this is a
[1:03:38] Crockpot right turn it on low and leave
[1:03:41] it alone and come back several hours
[1:03:43] later and you got something to eat we
[1:03:45] did that not too long ago Jim did man it
[1:03:47] was good pot roast too you're on losing
[1:03:50] ground right there you don't have
[1:03:52] nothing to stand on you you must be
[1:03:55] patient he's not asking you he said you
[1:03:56] must be
[1:03:57] patient we should have now here we go
[1:04:01] you got to have patience with God first
[1:04:02] but we should have patience with one
[1:04:05] another too and I wrote myself a note
[1:04:07] but I'm going to leave it for right now
[1:04:09] I'll not read
[1:04:11] it like I've tried to get this message
[1:04:13] over look at the Tabernacle now this is
[1:04:15] a prophet of God I'm
[1:04:17] nothing all right I'm just a minister he
[1:04:20] was a church aged messenger a prophet
[1:04:23] that brought the word he was the conduit
[1:04:25] of God Amen he was someone that you
[1:04:28] thought well he's just going to stand
[1:04:29] there and everything he says the people
[1:04:31] just going to do what he says right
[1:04:34] right right wouldn't that be the way
[1:04:36] yeah they wasn't one denomination sto
[1:04:39] because brother brandom came right there
[1:04:43] wasn't one
[1:04:44] woman quit bobing her hair that didn't
[1:04:47] want
[1:04:49] to it's hard to do I've tried to have
[1:04:52] patience this is 33 years years see have
[1:04:55] patience women still Bob their hair
[1:04:58] still just the same you know why cuz you
[1:05:01] believe what you
[1:05:02] obey wait have you have to if you ain't
[1:05:05] got it don't try to build on this down
[1:05:07] here have patience that's why I said it
[1:05:09] was it took him 33 years to come to the
[1:05:11] place to preach this to where he could
[1:05:14] give his people instruction on how to
[1:05:17] stop doing this and how to quit doing
[1:05:18] this or that or the other have
[1:05:22] patience wherefore seeing also we are
[1:05:24] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:05:26] witness let us lay aside every weight
[1:05:29] and sin which does so easily beset us
[1:05:32] let us run with what patience the race
[1:05:36] that is set before us uh that's what I
[1:05:38] was trying to explain to you the other
[1:05:39] day when you say patience Lauren
[1:05:41] everybody says patience well just you
[1:05:42] know just go sit in your easy chair I've
[1:05:44] always told you if you're looking for a
[1:05:46] job don't pray to God find you a job and
[1:05:48] then go sit down in a lounge
[1:05:51] chair God is not going to come knocking
[1:05:54] on your door and say hey I got you a job
[1:05:57] now you going to have to get your sorry
[1:05:58] high in out love for one and then God
[1:06:01] will open the door for the choices you
[1:06:04] make if you put God
[1:06:06] first all these other things the Bible
[1:06:08] says will fill what fall into place
[1:06:11] problem is is we don't start we start by
[1:06:13] our what we
[1:06:15] want not my will but thy will be
[1:06:19] done then let God if you're asking for a
[1:06:22] job or or getting married or whatever
[1:06:25] more ask
[1:06:28] God but listen don't just never visit
[1:06:30] her
[1:06:32] again if you're talking about marrying
[1:06:34] somebody or you know you still got you
[1:06:36] know what I'm saying don't don't pull
[1:06:37] your door up shut in your closet I mean
[1:06:39] in your bedroom and say I ain't coming
[1:06:40] out till God gives me you'll
[1:06:44] die you'll be lonely and you'll
[1:06:47] die God wants you to what run with
[1:06:50] patience run with patience the race it
[1:06:53] so that set before us looking onto Jesus
[1:06:56] what the alter and finish of our faith
[1:06:58] in other words look this way how many of
[1:07:01] you new drivers the problem with the new
[1:07:03] driving with me was I was looking at the
[1:07:06] at the hood of the car and trying to
[1:07:08] judge the white line and the yellow line
[1:07:10] I don't know if I'm the only one but
[1:07:11] maybe I
[1:07:13] am you can't do that you'll be off like
[1:07:15] this you got to what pick you a spot
[1:07:18] from here to the door 50 ft away or
[1:07:20] somewhat and when you do that it's like
[1:07:23] brother r talks about the guy little kid
[1:07:25] with a
[1:07:26] bicycle and he rode that little th thing
[1:07:28] and everybody was falling off why they
[1:07:30] was falling off cuz they was watching
[1:07:31] their wheels and he get close to the
[1:07:33] edge and they just fall over but he said
[1:07:36] how did you win Johnny Johnny said I
[1:07:38] just looked at the prize and took off
[1:07:41] and that's what we got to do we got to
[1:07:42] look at the prize take off and listen
[1:07:45] make sure it's the right
[1:07:47] prize looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:07:49] finish of our faith who for the joy that
[1:07:52] was set before him and endured the cross
[1:07:55] despising the shame and is sat down at
[1:07:57] the right hand of the Throne of God
[1:07:59] Matthew 10:22 says you shall be hated of
[1:08:02] all men for my name's sake but he that
[1:08:04] what endureth to the end shall be
[1:08:07] saved that word endureth means what to
[1:08:10] remain abide not recede or flee that's
[1:08:14] our problem we get a little bit of
[1:08:16] something going on in our life and you
[1:08:22] disappear
[1:08:24] don't do
[1:08:25] that don't do that not recede or flee to
[1:08:30] preserve under misfortunes and trials to
[1:08:33] hold fast to one's faith in Christ to
[1:08:36] endure bear bravely and
[1:08:39] calmly this ill treatment the word end
[1:08:42] means the end to which all things relate
[1:08:45] the aim or the purpose you know what the
[1:08:48] end of God's plan is eternal
[1:08:52] life the end of his plan is eternal life
[1:08:55] we don't need Redemption when we get
[1:08:56] over
[1:08:57] there Redemption will be over listen
[1:08:59] Redemption is over for the Gentiles when
[1:09:01] we're down
[1:09:02] here right amen it continues on to the
[1:09:05] white Throne of judgment but after that
[1:09:07] the end is just the beginning of your
[1:09:11] eternity the end of all things has come
[1:09:13] upon man well if the end of all things
[1:09:15] then we're just going to die and we're
[1:09:16] just going to evaporate no the end of
[1:09:19] all things is is if you pass away from
[1:09:21] this world you're going to step over
[1:09:22] into another one and you're going to be
[1:09:24] Eternal that don't that a end like this
[1:09:28] all right Hebrews 6:12 says that you be
[1:09:32] not
[1:09:33] slothful but followers of them who
[1:09:35] through faith and P look followers of
[1:09:38] them who through faith and patience
[1:09:40] inherit the promises for when God made a
[1:09:43] promise to Abraham because he could
[1:09:44] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[1:09:47] because he knew then see the promise
[1:09:49] that he made Adam and Eve he made it
[1:09:50] with condition but he made it before the
[1:09:56] fall right eat that tree you're good
[1:09:59] don't eat that tree you're bad right
[1:10:02] right but then now that we're down here
[1:10:04] in the sin or in the fall the Fallen
[1:10:07] stage the first three dimensions God
[1:10:09] comes down and he says I know you can't
[1:10:11] do it I know you're going to have
[1:10:13] problems cuz I've already seen you have
[1:10:16] problems but I'm going to make a way I'm
[1:10:19] going to give you a
[1:10:21] provision it's called
[1:10:25] and it's called an
[1:10:27] unconditional
[1:10:30] Covenant most every Covenant has a
[1:10:33] condition to it do this don't do that
[1:10:36] I'm going to do this for you you got to
[1:10:37] do this for me back and forth God raised
[1:10:40] his hand up and he said because I could
[1:10:41] swear by no other I swore by myself I'm
[1:10:43] going to do this
[1:10:45] thing I am is his name I
[1:10:50] am he's still The Great I Am CU who's
[1:10:54] going to do this plan I
[1:10:57] am for when God made promise to Abraham
[1:10:59] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:11:02] swore by himself saying surely blessing
[1:11:04] I Will Bless thee multiplying I look at
[1:11:07] those words I Brother D preached on this
[1:11:09] long time ago uh you go to Hebrews but
[1:11:12] if you'll go over to Genesis about 12
[1:11:15] there's about 20 times God said I will
[1:11:18] he didn't tell Abraham now Abraham you
[1:11:20] you no he said I will shed right here
[1:11:23] too surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:11:25] and multiplying I will multiply thee and
[1:11:28] so after he had patiently endured for
[1:11:33] 25
[1:11:35] years he obtained the
[1:11:37] promise Luke 21:19 says in your
[1:11:41] patience possess ye your
[1:11:45] soul let's look at godliness just for a
[1:11:47] minute and we'll close pick that up this
[1:11:51] afternoon godliness means holiness
[1:11:54] there's something we'll get to later on
[1:11:56] I want to see I want you to see but it's
[1:11:58] reverence
[1:11:59] respect piety towards God are the word
[1:12:04] godliness 2 Timothy 3:2 if you'll look
[1:12:08] in your Bible and look up the word
[1:12:10] godliness Timothy covers it about 20
[1:12:12] times almost in his chapters in those
[1:12:15] little chapters of Timothy so read the
[1:12:17] whole chapters of Timothy every one of
[1:12:19] them two one two and three I think maybe
[1:12:22] there's four I can't remember I don't
[1:12:24] have to remember it's in my Bible second
[1:12:27] Timothy 3: all the old people said amen
[1:12:30] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:12:31] selves Here We Go Again Covetous
[1:12:34] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:12:37] to parents have I hit anybody yet I'm
[1:12:40] fixing to if you didn't unthankful
[1:12:43] Unholy without natural affection tell
[1:12:46] that to the government truth Breakers
[1:12:48] false accusers
[1:12:51] incontinent somebody stand stand up that
[1:12:53] I ain't hit them yet didn't think so
[1:12:56] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:12:59] traitors he High minded lovers of
[1:13:04] pleasure than going to
[1:13:06] church having a form then of godliness
[1:13:10] that we're talking about our piety but
[1:13:13] denying the
[1:13:15] power you only really believe what you
[1:13:18] obey and that's where the power lies but
[1:13:22] you can have a form of that power and it
[1:13:24] be
[1:13:25] wrong many a woman preachers got up and
[1:13:28] preached messages that probably could
[1:13:29] out preach anybody in this
[1:13:32] building but they're wrong right because
[1:13:35] that's what the Bible says they're wrong
[1:13:37] so go back to the beginning to the Bible
[1:13:40] if it's wrong I don't care what they
[1:13:43] preach they're not supposed
[1:13:46] to all right having a form of godliness
[1:13:48] but denying the power thereof from
[1:13:51] such turn away
[1:13:53] for of this sord are they which creep
[1:13:55] into houses churches and Lead silly
[1:13:59] women churches Laden with sins LED away
[1:14:02] with many lust ever
[1:14:06] learning and never able to come to the
[1:14:10] knowledge of the
[1:14:12] truth 1 Timothy 3:16 and without
[1:14:15] controversy we read this the beginning
[1:14:17] great is the mystery of godliness God
[1:14:19] was manifested in the flesh justified in
[1:14:21] the spirit seen of angels preach of the
[1:14:24] Gentiles believed on in the world and
[1:14:26] received up into glory and as I said
[1:14:27] before came back down and gave us every
[1:14:29] bit of that everybody with
[1:14:34] me so now brother Brown's getting into
[1:14:36] godliness and we'll read this and get
[1:14:38] musicians come on but if you got genuine
[1:14:42] Faith then put genuine virtue to it then
[1:14:44] genuine knowledge then genuine patience
[1:14:47] then genu I mean genuine Temperance then
[1:14:49] genuine patience you're moving right on
[1:14:52] up the line all right you're you're
[1:14:54] working the
[1:14:55] plan fifthly add godliness oh my
[1:15:00] godliness to be added what does
[1:15:02] godliness
[1:15:03] mean now remember you got a part of
[1:15:06] godliness when you got born again cuz
[1:15:08] you got part of God but you really got
[1:15:11] to go way up here to the top almost
[1:15:14] before he asked you to be that right and
[1:15:18] not just be that on
[1:15:20] Sunday I didn't get an amen from that
[1:15:24] what does godliness mean I looked in
[1:15:26] four or five dictionaries and couldn't
[1:15:27] even find what it meant finally I was
[1:15:30] down at brother Jeff there and found in
[1:15:31] a dictionary godliness means to be like
[1:15:34] God oh my after you got faith virtue
[1:15:37] knowledge temper patience then be like
[1:15:39] God you say I can't do that brother
[1:15:42] brandom yes you
[1:15:46] can let me just read you a few
[1:15:48] scriptures and he talks about Matthew
[1:15:49] 5:48 be you therefore what
[1:15:51] Perfect all all the virtue see this is
[1:15:55] now let's stand to our feet you only
[1:15:57] really believe what you obey all right
[1:15:59] I'm going to believe that the virtue of
[1:16:01] God Temperance patience of God as a
[1:16:04] portion was put in me at my new birth
[1:16:06] amen that's what I believe but I don't I
[1:16:10] can't obey all of it because I don't
[1:16:12] have that kind of
[1:16:14] godliness way up there in the
[1:16:17] pyramid when I get born again because
[1:16:19] you start down here right but as my
[1:16:22] faith rise R es so does my virtues rise
[1:16:26] everybody with me all the virtue all the
[1:16:29] things that's in God is in you now if I
[1:16:31] believe that then I got to obey
[1:16:34] it be therefore p r f e c what's that
[1:16:37] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:16:39] perfect you got way up here now before
[1:16:42] you're asked to do that in other words
[1:16:43] the part of God's plan was that he's not
[1:16:46] going to have you act like God at the
[1:16:49] beginning he wants you to have virtue he
[1:16:52] wants you have have knowledge Temperance
[1:16:55] patience then he asked you to be like
[1:16:59] God you get way up here before you're
[1:17:01] asked to do that all these things has to
[1:17:04] be added
[1:17:07] first then when you get up here he's
[1:17:10] asked you now to be perfect godliness
