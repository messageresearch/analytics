[28:04] us our daily bread now just for a few
[28:06] moments as we talk about you in Jesus
[28:08] name we pray amen
[28:11] revelations chapter 5 chapter 6 verse 5
[28:14] and when he had opened the third seal I
[28:16] heard the third beast say come and see
[28:17] and I beheld and lo a black horse and he
[28:20] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[28:21] in his hand and I heard a voice in the
[28:23] midst of the four beasts say a measure
[28:24] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[28:27] of barley for a penny see thou hurt not
[28:29] the oil and the wine you may be seated
[28:32] in the Lord add his blessing to reading
[28:33] the word really enjoyed that what
[28:36] brother Aaron had Wednesday night hey
[28:38] man that was good job but there is good
[28:40] job that wasn't you so I'm not giving
[28:42] you the good job in the Lord it was it
[28:45] but it had to come through a vessel the
[28:50] tabernacle that yielded itself the
[28:52] garden and we appreciate that all the
[28:54] all the brothers and all the teachers
[28:55] and all the ones that yield ourselves to
[28:58] God so that God can speak to us man
[29:01] that's the way he ordained it I was
[29:02] telling the church the Sunday School
[29:05] class you know this message in this
[29:09] Bible is a road map and then it's a road
[29:13] map now what did you use to have to do
[29:15] with the road map you folded it up right
[29:18] I mean you had to tape map fold in 101
[29:20] to get that sucker back together again
[29:22] right brother John
[29:23] now you just open your phone up and go
[29:25] hey this is where I'm going but we used
[29:27] to have to fold it well that's what God
[29:28] give us he gave us a five fold ministry
[29:33] to open that mouth up amen to open that
[29:37] map up he gave us a five fold ministry
[29:39] to open that map up and say here is what
[29:42] I'm saying to you
[29:43] so there's only got to come to a five
[29:45] fold ministry to tell us where we're
[29:46] going but I like to like brother Dale
[29:49] said I want to know what we're
[29:50] here now the position of a believer in
[29:53] Christ is okay to do that we're going to
[29:55] be here and that where we were there but
[29:57] what about right now what's your
[29:58] position now in God what is the position
[30:01] that you are holding and under this
[30:04] third seal showing that this is a
[30:07] position that we must come to it's not
[30:10] just a seal of a black course and I put
[30:12] all this back up here again and you've
[30:14] got it so you can read it but this is
[30:17] what we're coming to because look when
[30:20] we get back and start on the fourth seal
[30:22] listen brothers and sisters the fourth
[30:25] seal is the word manifested amen it's
[30:32] the culmination of everything if the if
[30:35] the rapture takes place on the fourth
[30:37] seal you've got the body change you've
[30:40] got the resurrection you've got full
[30:43] revelation in manifestation in a group
[30:46] of people in this age right here that
[30:49] we're living in and it's the Eagle Age
[30:51] and we're getting to that I'm just
[30:53] prepping you for them for the fourth
[30:55] seal because the fourth seal really if
[30:57] you read the fourth seal it is kind of
[30:59] pale it's just kind of vanilla it's not
[31:03] anything really on the wool but you got
[31:05] a lot though because they named death
[31:07] hell follows but listen if all those
[31:11] things come to pass that means that
[31:14] somebody has already come to a position
[31:19] or a revelation of the rapture amen
[31:24] somebody's already come to that not
[31:27] going to has already come to it but here
[31:29] we are still in the third seal though
[31:31] because remember we're talking about
[31:33] Redemption Redemption Redemption
[31:36] justification sanctification baptism the
[31:38] Holy Ghost and the word made manifest
[31:40] are you can go back to the for combat
[31:43] baseline arts man and eagle just
[31:46] reviewing through this for a minute
[31:47] line arts man and eagle those are the
[31:50] four combat beasts that is the Holy
[31:52] Ghost in the seven churches in man we're
[31:55] going to talk about in just a minute
[31:56] because there is a throne position
[31:59] change coming up in this fourth seal
[32:03] there's a throne position change I'll
[32:07] talk about in just a minute codes will
[32:09] short cuz remember last week we talked
[32:11] about the Father's throne and we talked
[32:12] about Jesus and I only do that what the
[32:14] father tells me and the father is the
[32:17] one doing the work and I come in my
[32:19] father's name and he keeps talking about
[32:21] a father and Phillip says where's your
[32:23] daddy where's your father jesus said if
[32:27] you've seen me you've seen the father
[32:28] now easily was lying if he wasn't
[32:31] telling the truth and man so that was
[32:33] the father made manifest in the son and
[32:37] that was the son of man but now remember
[32:40] he wasn't manifested son of man through
[32:42] the church ages he was manifested as the
[32:44] son of God all right so we'll talk about
[32:46] that in just a minute but these are the
[32:49] things that we need to see because
[32:51] coming up to the fourth seal when that
[32:54] fourth seal ends we take a rapture in
[32:57] the position of paralleling with the
[33:00] church ages everybody got that say man
[33:02] all right so now let's put it up here
[33:04] and let's look at Redemption Redemption
[33:06] Redemption break you the seals not
[33:07] necessarily for the soul you ought to be
[33:09] able to quote these okay let them quote
[33:16] it but let's put it up here so we can
[33:17] talk about it for a minute okay
[33:19] Redemption Redemption Redemption the
[33:20] breaking of the seals are not
[33:21] necessarily for the soul because what
[33:23] they didn't have that revelation down
[33:25] here the revelation of the Son of God is
[33:27] that Jesus Christ died for your sins
[33:30] and that son of God spirit God came back
[33:34] into you burn out the old nature we've
[33:38] been talking about this burn out the old
[33:39] nature and put glad himself in there and
[33:43] man spirit God inside in your soul you
[33:46] and God in there's persons God working
[33:49] in you and through you and then that was
[33:53] the son of God revelation down to the
[33:55] church ages but now read it in just a
[33:58] minute we're brother Branham said but
[34:00] just for a moment the Son of man has got
[34:02] to come back into power till the Son of
[34:06] God
[34:07] you don't resurrect the Son of God he
[34:11] spirit God he's eternal he is the
[34:13] resurrection but the son of man had to
[34:16] have a resurrection and like a
[34:17] downstairs you got to remember listen we
[34:19] were not connected listen to me a minute
[34:21] we were not perfected in jesus's flesh
[34:27] his flesh was perfected amen
[34:31] his flesh was perfect in him by him
[34:33] inheriting eternal life in his flesh you
[34:36] and I can inherit eternal life in the
[34:38] flesh
[34:39] but our eternal life that brother Brown
[34:41] said Jesus come to bring internal life
[34:43] no no no he ain't come to bring us
[34:46] eternal life he come to make a way for
[34:50] us to get back to eternal life amen but
[34:53] in the body he had to be made eternal
[34:56] therefore we can in the resurrection be
[35:00] made eternal in the flesh but in the
[35:02] soul of Jesus Christ was Almighty God
[35:05] and in the soul of Jesus Christ was me
[35:07] and you now we're still talking about
[35:08] the new birth we're talking about the
[35:10] Holy Ghost something dying but we're
[35:13] talking about full fellowship that see
[35:15] this is full fellowship the words sure
[35:18] listen the word was manifested in every
[35:20] church age in a portion small portion
[35:25] but it was enough to get them born-again
[35:28] get them in the body
[35:30] they loved the Lord they did the things
[35:32] that they were supposed to do and they
[35:34] died and went by the grave believing
[35:37] that what they had in their soul was
[35:39] going to bring them back up that's kind
[35:42] of the vanilla the whole thing right but
[35:44] now the Bible doesn't talk about
[35:47] everybody being that way the Bible talks
[35:50] about an endtime group of people it's
[35:51] going to stand on the earth and say we
[35:53] which are alive and remain we which are
[35:57] alive and remain can only be made
[35:58] manifest here now Paul spoke it here
[36:02] Paul spoken in the first church age and
[36:06] then but it's not made manifest until
[36:08] this church and then it's made manifest
[36:11] for me in you we which are alive and
[36:13] remain will look none of these are alive
[36:15] and we're way over we're well we're way
[36:19] like right here right now we're standing
[36:25] in this church age right here and then
[36:28] at the end of the age getting
[36:31] ready to go into what eternal life so
[36:34] we're kind of it's all done for these
[36:39] manifestations have all been done but
[36:41] what's going to happen is all this
[36:42] manifestation of the white horse red
[36:44] horse black horse is going to culminate
[36:46] in the pale horse all the line ox man
[36:48] and eagle is going to culminate in what
[36:49] right at the end time we're all going to
[36:51] have to come to a place our position
[36:55] that God can use us more than he's ever
[36:58] used anybody before and then and that
[37:02] position is our position it's not
[37:04] something it's not something that we
[37:06] hope for think about maybe it's going to
[37:08] happen while we're in the message kind
[37:15] of like downstairs you know the Jews
[37:17] walked up to Jesus the Jews walked up to
[37:20] Jesus and said we're circumcised we're
[37:25] circumcised
[37:26] PAH what are you talking about
[37:28] circumcision don't make no difference
[37:31] we built our whole faith on circumcision
[37:37] the problem is they didn't build their
[37:39] faith on Abraham's faith because Abraham
[37:44] didn't build his position on the
[37:47] circumcision the circumcision was an
[37:51] aftereffect right God in Romans three
[37:58] fuel reading Romans 3:4 we've been
[38:00] reading this morning Paul says God
[38:03] accepted Abraham's faith then he was
[38:07] circumcised he was not circumcised first
[38:11] because the Bible says the faith of
[38:13] Abraham not the circumcision of Abraham
[38:16] so at least what am I telling you what
[38:18] are we talking about it's not the
[38:19] message of the hour that's gonna save us
[38:25] it's the faith in the word that's been
[38:29] brought in the message of the hour amen
[38:32] if listen I'm gonna tell you something
[38:34] if David we were we were reading it this
[38:37] morning David blessed is a man who God
[38:41] will not impute sin he wrote through
[38:44] all bringing it down and tell him bless
[38:46] it is look at him it was a murderer you
[38:51] know what he was a brother John he was a
[38:53] capital murderer he would have went to
[38:56] federal prison because he premeditated
[38:58] that murder amen
[39:01] his best friend he told him he said
[39:03] y'all back up a little bit when the
[39:05] battle gets hot and said you know
[39:07] they're not Lords they're gonna kill him
[39:09] he knew that that's what he wanted he
[39:12] wanted that guy out of the way so he
[39:13] could have his wife because he had
[39:15] already committed adultery and already
[39:17] had pregnant her so he had to get his
[39:19] friend out of the way but what happened
[39:22] when the Prophet came on the scene and
[39:24] told David the parable talking about
[39:28] David think about the Prophet in the end
[39:31] time bringing the parable bring in the
[39:36] parable of the man and the sheep and
[39:38] stole one and had a bunch and he stole
[39:41] one and David said kill the man that's
[39:45] the judgment we would pass kill the man
[39:46] David said David said kill the man get
[39:49] rid of him and Nathan said David thou
[39:51] art the man but I have prayed for you
[39:58] you weak thing all this you know brother
[40:01] Branham was a great man that's right but
[40:03] you know he prayed for us that prophetic
[40:04] gift that he had he prayed for me in you
[40:08] because he brought a message that we've
[40:11] already proved that he brought a message
[40:13] that wasn't for them people back there
[40:18] it was not for them it was for us oh
[40:22] sure
[40:23] the the soul is redeemed now that was
[40:26] millions of people brought to the new
[40:28] birth by William Reynolds ministry no
[40:30] doubt disclude all the healings in the
[40:35] miracles the new birth the people that
[40:37] were brought to Christ but that wasn't
[40:40] his all of this message Dwight Moody
[40:43] brought me into Christ Jack's Shuler
[40:46] keep naming them keep naming them it
[40:48] wasn't just William branham's load on
[40:51] his shoulder to bring everybody to Jesus
[40:53] Christ no but that was part of his
[40:55] ministry and it brought up to a place
[40:56] though and he finally said
[40:58] that was not my message it was debate on
[41:03] the hook well what was the bait the bait
[41:07] was the healing campaign the hook was
[41:10] the message of the hour the real message
[41:13] last I don't say real message I don't
[41:15] say real message because the other was
[41:17] followed but the real reason he came the
[41:21] real ministry that he came was was to
[41:24] get a bride that would go up that statue
[41:26] of a perfect man and come to a position
[41:28] to be waiting for the revelation of the
[41:30] rapture I'll read you the quote in just
[41:31] a few minutes out of the rapture
[41:32] medicine a man waiting for the
[41:35] revelation of the rapture so we have to
[41:37] come to a place and we're sitting there
[41:39] like you know like you're sitting like
[41:43] if you've watched the dragsters them
[41:45] dragsters elf sit there they keep the
[41:47] brakes on but that motor is shaking the
[41:49] whole thing's shaking but buddy when he
[41:50] lets off that guy I mean off that brake
[41:53] you know 300 miles an hour and that's
[41:55] what we're gonna do we're sitting there
[41:57] and we're waiting and we're waiting and
[41:59] we're waiting you're like a like a dog
[42:00] you've ever seen the dog point that dog
[42:04] is and you're holding him around hearing
[42:06] that dogs and when you say go or when
[42:09] you say get him well that's the way you
[42:11] and I are gonna have to be but you know
[42:13] what the dog knows what he's waiting on
[42:16] I just got that okay the dog was what
[42:22] the dog knew when he was getting he got
[42:24] dog knew what he was going to do the
[42:26] engine of that motor knew what it's
[42:28] going to do it's going to go straight
[42:29] down that road but it was held by
[42:31] something and that's the problem is we
[42:33] hold these things back we are our own
[42:36] problem amen but full manifestation is
[42:41] coming down to even when we look at the
[42:43] the four deaf messengers that eat the
[42:46] bug down you got four we got four live
[42:48] messengers bring it back brother Brown
[42:50] says even water blood life and then you
[42:54] got to feed the baby the baby's gotta
[42:55] come to word manifestation babies are
[43:00] beautiful but you gotta feed them you
[43:03] got to feed them that's what we've had
[43:04] for 50 years we've been fed obviously
[43:07] some of us has not been good food
[43:13] you know there's a difference in food
[43:15] and good food the other night we had
[43:18] good food hey man we had good food but
[43:22] you know there sometimes you eat
[43:23] something that's like well it's just
[43:24] filling the hole right and then they
[43:27] just filled the hole up you know right
[43:30] Kaitlyn
[43:30] I saw you looking he's got a big hole to
[43:34] fill Stearns a big old boy I'm telling
[43:37] you baby you got a big ol hole to filled
[43:39] but sometimes you just fill it up that's
[43:41] the way we've been but we want to fill
[43:42] it up with good food we'll fill it up
[43:44] with something that will sustain us
[43:46] because like I was telling them in the
[43:48] Sunday School class and I see this in
[43:51] all of our life we got to come to a
[43:52] place which we have tried for years
[43:56] excuse me
[43:57] we have tried for years to figure out
[43:59] how this thing's gonna end Abraham now
[44:03] Abraham tried a little bit to figure out
[44:05] what God was doing amen
[44:08] Abraham said okay I'm fit enough I'll go
[44:11] to Hagar and I'll try to produce a child
[44:13] will you see what he's doing then he
[44:15] tried to give his life away to to save
[44:17] his own skin so he could stay alive for
[44:19] a little while longer and that didn't
[44:21] work and then he got to a place to where
[44:24] he was so dead
[44:27] he was so dead till he couldn't produce
[44:31] Sarah couldn't produce and there's no
[44:34] vitamin there's no vitamin or anything
[44:38] he could eat more
[44:39] he just said God I'm dead if you if
[44:45] you're gonna bring that child through me
[44:47] you're gonna have to do it you know what
[44:48] God said
[44:49] finally finally Abraham you're getting
[44:54] what but I remember he started in that
[44:57] faith in Genesis chapter 12 by getting
[45:01] up and walking out he didn't have a
[45:04] quote book he didn't have a prophet to
[45:07] tell him to get up he heard a voice how
[45:13] many of us have heard voice just told us
[45:14] to do things they're not the good voices
[45:17] right right didn't think so right all
[45:21] the time but he got up and walked and
[45:24] I said there's my man right there he's
[45:27] believing me and you know what he done
[45:29] he kept going Genesis 12 Genesis 13
[45:31] Genesis 14 15 16 and then it culminated
[45:34] in his faith he just said I'm I'm done
[45:36] Lord and I'm done I'm done I can't do
[45:39] nothing you're gonna have to do it for
[45:40] me and that's the same way with you and
[45:42] I we can't like I was telling them back
[45:46] in the 70s while we come into message
[45:48] and then everybody's talking about the
[45:49] squeeze and I saw about 77 well we you
[45:52] know we got kind of caught up in it and
[45:54] dad bought 55 gallons of gas I'm telling
[45:58] you he bought 55 gallons of gas and put
[46:01] it in a metal building at 90 something
[46:05] degrees in the summertime it's a wonder
[46:09] we were not blown off the map but the
[46:11] problem with that is gasoline evaporates
[46:14] so it started going down we never used
[46:16] to drop of it it just starts collectors
[46:18] started evaporating we took and hit 22
[46:21] shells up in the woods we can't even
[46:23] find them now right
[46:26] we've tried I took the metal detector we
[46:28] tried to find we buried in those
[46:31] military cases we buried 22 shells
[46:34] because man we might not be able to make
[46:36] it you know we we see that was just that
[46:39] was our mentality but now we've come to
[46:40] the time where we gonna have to trust in
[46:43] God technology has been so now to where
[46:46] you can't go anywhere they can go
[46:50] through your house and they can put a
[46:52] hit put a heat sensor on your house tell
[46:54] you where you sitting
[46:55] how many's in the house how much money
[46:57] you got in the house so it ain't gonna
[46:59] matter about that so what God's done
[47:00] gods let the devil just work right into
[47:02] his plan Tory says hey Satan do all this
[47:07] that's fine do it get all this
[47:08] information you want but I'm gonna
[47:11] protect my people
[47:12] I'm gonna protect my people I'm gonna
[47:16] show them what positions they're in are
[47:18] coming to and what they have to do is is
[47:22] just believe in me Satan that's
[47:24] something you've never done
[47:26] amen I something the devil's never done
[47:29] he's never believed a thing God said
[47:31] he's always been contrary to God so we
[47:35] come to a place of position that we got
[47:37] to look at
[47:38] that's why I said the third seal is very
[47:41] important because if you don't know that
[47:42] you've got the new birth you you're kind
[47:45] of behind the eight-ball there's got to
[47:48] come a time when it's settled now listen
[47:50] Satan is going to always throw stuff up
[47:51] at you you know that I mean always like
[47:55] every minute of the day but remember
[47:59] like brother Ernie says when his mouth
[48:00] movement he's lying when Satan's mouth
[48:03] but even if he tells you the truth he's
[48:05] lying because he's using it to twist it
[48:07] amen
[48:09] so we must come to a position though to
[48:12] where we've at least settled one thing
[48:13] that in our soul God is residing there
[48:16] and he is like brother Dale come up this
[48:18] morning he's working his way out it's an
[48:22] inside job it's an inside job Satan
[48:26] loves to put all on the outside make you
[48:28] look pretty and all God works on the
[48:30] inside and it sometimes it's so simple
[48:32] and sometimes like these cells these
[48:34] cells to me folks
[48:35] even me being going through this again
[48:38] it has become more simple than it ever
[48:41] has been right we were talking about
[48:43] this other become more simple because
[48:45] it's what it takes that five fold map to
[48:49] break you down to show you that it's not
[48:52] some great something why would God break
[48:54] something it's like the Bible says wine
[48:56] with a father if a child asks for bread
[48:59] and you give him a rock what God's not
[49:03] going to give us something we can't
[49:04] understand he can't give us something we
[49:07] can't understand because you know what
[49:09] we can do we can say God you made it too
[49:12] hard no God is gonna say son I made it
[49:15] too simple so simple remember that it
[49:19] hide it that it hides from the wise and
[49:22] prudent sometimes we try to figure it
[49:25] out but if we'll see that the seals
[49:27] though was given absolutely sure there's
[49:31] white horse rider red horse rider black
[49:33] horse rider pale horse rider that's for
[49:35] the world that's for the world but
[49:40] underneath that or inside that the
[49:42] inside working is God working on a group
[49:44] of people a bride to come to a position
[49:48] for us to get out of here
[49:51] I don't want to do funerals I don't like
[49:54] to do amen
[49:58] well then let's strive and see you can't
[50:02] just you can't just go and say well I'm
[50:05] gonna believe so much so I'm just gonna
[50:06] sit in my house and don't like a God
[50:09] told me one time he said I'm just gonna
[50:10] set on my couch and wait for God to
[50:12] bring me a job I said you will starve to
[50:14] death
[50:17] God is not gonna come to your door and
[50:19] go I got you a job that's not a good
[50:23] daddy a good daddy lets you go out there
[50:26] and find and seek the will of the Lord
[50:29] and all the things that we do we should
[50:31] what seek you first the kingdom because
[50:35] if we seek the kingdom see that's the
[50:36] full manifestation we're coming to
[50:38] because remember tonight we were talking
[50:40] about Thrones a little bit last Sunday
[50:41] we're talking about a little more this
[50:42] Sunday to be a throne there has to be a
[50:46] Dominion to have a throne I mean you
[50:50] know put a throne out there in the
[50:52] middle of the pasture well it's
[50:53] powerless but a throne with a kingdom
[50:58] jesus said that kingdom come Thy will be
[51:03] done I don't have a kingdom here you
[51:04] know why I'll read it to you well
[51:06] something I wrote when Jesus was here he
[51:08] didn't have no subjects he was telling
[51:14] the truth when he told Pilate he said if
[51:16] if I had subjects here they would find
[51:18] he had no subject in his kingdom he was
[51:23] the kingdom but he hadn't released a
[51:26] life for his kingdom his kingdom is the
[51:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it was in
[51:33] no one when Jesus was on earth but he
[51:37] had to be the first he had to be the one
[51:39] that opened up the door for us to get
[51:42] into that Kingdom and let him sit on the
[51:45] throne of our heart now you know we want
[51:48] his if he by the new birth he is on the
[51:50] throne in our soul that's right son of
[51:54] God the Son of God come into your heart
[51:57] sets on the throne and takes dominion
[51:59] over your soul because if you're still
[52:03] alive
[52:03] you can't have too
[52:06] that's why I said you gotta be dead you
[52:09] got to be dead your old husband that's
[52:11] what we're talking about last Sunday
[52:12] your old husband let's read it let's
[52:15] keep going let's go past everybody knows
[52:17] the symbols of the seal but remember
[52:20] there was no power given third seal is
[52:22] extremely important bring up that one it
[52:24] was protected by the lamb just grow past
[52:31] quote number one Aaron did a good job
[52:35] telling you what to order the wine was
[52:36] Wednesday night so we'll wait back there
[52:44] this ain't helping my flow no power
[52:50] given keep going next next one
[52:55] there ya go alright so the third sealed
[52:59] extremely important it's protected by
[53:01] the lamp I will restore now what look if
[53:03] the lamb comes remember keep the senior
[53:09] back your head the lamb is the son of
[53:12] man the lamb the son of man when he gave
[53:17] his life for us son of God can't give
[53:19] his life he's eternal easy he's when it
[53:23] comes in yeah it sure he's one it's all
[53:25] connected but the son of man is who we
[53:27] have to believe in we have to believe
[53:29] that God came in human flesh right died
[53:32] to release the life to come back in the
[53:36] menu alright so we have to that's what
[53:38] we have to believe that we have to
[53:42] believe that okay so he's going to
[53:46] restore not reform so we come up here
[53:48] then this is not this is not Reformation
[53:52] it starts in Reformation but it comes
[53:54] into ref to restoration because it
[53:57] restores because watch it was the Holy
[54:01] Ghost like we're talking about here in
[54:03] the seal number three it was the Holy
[54:05] Ghost in these ages through the Luther
[54:08] and Wesley but now remember right in
[54:11] between here what did God do he brought
[54:16] Pennock a Pentecostal experience then to
[54:18] ha
[54:19] restore the gifts to restore the Holy
[54:23] Ghost back into the church
[54:25] now you say what no it wasn't that it
[54:27] wasn't in here but it come to a position
[54:30] for it to work 1906 Azusa Street that
[54:36] Pentecostal experience had to come that
[54:38] way it had to come right here to restore
[54:42] the gifts to build a platform so that
[54:45] God could come into this age and restore
[54:47] all things restore everything bring
[54:49] everything back amen
[54:51] all right so look now remember we must
[54:54] be dead all right nobody got that we
[54:57] must be dead because you can't be on you
[54:59] can't have Satan sitting on your throne
[55:00] and God sitting on your throne he's a
[55:03] god there's not room for two that's why
[55:07] we don't need to be Tunis we need to be
[55:08] one that's true one that's that God
[55:10] sitting on the throne and you know
[55:12] brother Graham said it's guarding us in
[55:13] there's person that's okay but I want to
[55:16] be so xed out to where it's God it's God
[55:20] now he works back through my spirit into
[55:25] my body and works his way out but Satan
[55:28] works from there back in and tries to
[55:30] stop us but if that old man's dead
[55:33] Romans 7 verse 1 I know I'm beating a
[55:35] dead horse but listen I want us to be
[55:40] dead I wants to be dead you said well
[55:43] I'm born again Peter said being born
[55:45] again I wanted to when we come today I
[55:48] want to kill something I want something
[55:51] to die amen it's not either liveth can
[55:58] you say that it's not I've been living
[56:00] but Christ liveth in me for a woman
[56:03] which has a husband is bound by the law
[56:04] to her husband so long as she live it
[56:06] you're married to Satan when you're born
[56:09] right you're married to the devil
[56:13] through your union of your mom and daddy
[56:15] bringing you into the world and God
[56:17] giving you a soul but Satan attaches our
[56:20] nature to that soul that's wrong you
[56:23] listen you didn't come right I'm sorry
[56:27] that's why Jesus said you must be born
[56:30] again
[56:33] born from where above that things got to
[56:38] come into you and burn that old nature
[56:40] out not just divorce it are not just
[56:45] hide it
[56:47] amen not hide it it's got to be dead for
[56:52] the man which I have the husband is
[56:54] bound by the law to her husband so long
[56:55] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[56:57] she is loosed from the law of her
[57:01] husband in other words when you accept
[57:04] Christ let him kill Satan you can't let
[57:08] him kill that old nature you know it's
[57:11] like people says we always want always
[57:13] was eternal now I talked to a guy that
[57:15] said that we had eternal life when we
[57:17] were born as a baby in our soul now
[57:19] that's wrong that's contrary to the
[57:22] Bible that's contrary to the prophets
[57:23] message that's contrary to even the way
[57:25] I'm thinking I can't place that I listen
[57:31] I don't glory that I'm lost that I was
[57:34] lost but I thank God that I was lost
[57:38] because you know what there's not a
[57:40] person that's going to be sitting at
[57:41] that marriage supper that what not one
[57:45] person sister and not one there's not
[57:48] one prophet priest king whoever that
[57:52] whatever came here with eternal life
[57:53] except one man and that's Jesus Christ
[57:56] and then because the Bible says the
[57:58] unclean spirit goes out of a man where
[58:00] was it God don't dwell and unclean
[58:05] vessels so how is God an unclean spirit
[58:07] gonna be in the same place Kait the
[58:11] unclean spirit goes out of a man
[58:13] remember we use that with that was I'm
[58:17] sorry son it was the unclean spirit but
[58:20] remember if you if you don't fill it out
[58:22] with something fill it up with God that
[58:25] what cause he's still alive you gotta
[58:29] let God kill it when that thing comes
[58:32] back let God kill it so then if while
[58:37] her husband liveth she be married to
[58:38] another man she's you've called an
[58:39] adulteress that's what denominational
[58:41] ideas what it is now they think they're
[58:42] married to Christ but yet they're
[58:43] married to Satan I'm sorry that's just
[58:45] what it is
[58:46] all right people be what they be but
[58:49] that's exactly what the denominational
[58:50] system is it's the seven women taking
[58:53] hold of one man saying let us have your
[58:54] name but don't tell us how to dress
[58:57] don't tell us how to do things drove by
[59:01] Baptist Church Sunday last week and the
[59:05] guy walks in the church walks right in
[59:07] the church for the pair shorts a pair of
[59:09] shorts at a Baptist Church on Sunday I
[59:13] mean I don't like it on Wednesday night
[59:15] but you Sunday morning but you see what
[59:18] I mean though they don't preach on it so
[59:20] they've they push that out of the way
[59:22] you know let us take the name Baptist
[59:24] but don't tell us how to dress don't
[59:26] tell us how tight we'll see that's the
[59:27] way that's the spirit it's not a person
[59:29] it's a spirit on that person amen
[59:31] but if her husband be dead she is free
[59:34] from that law what is the law if you're
[59:37] married to another man and he's still
[59:38] alive you can't marry again amen that's
[59:42] quiet you can't what the Bible says so
[59:47] we can't go and marry another we can't
[59:50] divorce we divorce Satan and go marry
[59:54] somebody else
[59:54] we can't divorce God for sure that's my
[59:58] brother branham in marriage and divorce
[59:59] he said he can but she can't right he
[1:00:03] can if my wife commits adultery on me I
[1:00:06] can put her away and marry another she's
[1:00:08] dead to that degree to that degree
[1:00:11] because that's what the Bible says but
[1:00:13] now if I do it to her I'm sorry but she
[1:00:16] can't go marry again because of the law
[1:00:19] that God's put in place because if she
[1:00:22] does she becomes an adulteress that's
[1:00:24] what's happened with the churches the
[1:00:25] churches have become adulterers I'm not
[1:00:27] I'm just telling you what the Bible says
[1:00:29] harlot harlot is an adulterer okay but
[1:00:32] if her husband be dead she's free she's
[1:00:35] free from that law so she is no
[1:00:38] adulteress though she be married to
[1:00:41] another man
[1:00:42] wherefore my brethren you also have
[1:00:44] become dead to the law by the body of
[1:00:46] Christ that you should be married to
[1:00:48] another even to him who is raised from
[1:00:50] the dead know who is that Christ amen
[1:00:53] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:00:56] God for when we were in the flesh the
[1:00:58] MOE
[1:00:59] sins of sin which were by the law did
[1:01:02] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[1:01:04] Sun to death now I like that because
[1:01:07] that tells me I was dead man how you
[1:01:11] going to get into the law to the law of
[1:01:13] Redemption
[1:01:14] if you always was explain to me how you
[1:01:24] going to realize you is lost if you
[1:01:26] never was well then now wait a minute
[1:01:29] brother wait you said a couple months
[1:01:31] ago the real you didn't that's correct
[1:01:32] but that's God that didn't do it and you
[1:01:38] and I have got to have faith that he's
[1:01:39] come and lived inside of you and that
[1:01:41] you're xed out like I said you're dead
[1:01:43] and it's Christ that gets judged if he
[1:01:46] gets judged I get judged he don't get
[1:01:48] judged I don't get judged that's what I
[1:01:50] like judge my husband right and you know
[1:01:56] what Christ said bring it on bring it on
[1:01:59] judge me that's what he said in the
[1:02:03] Bible who are you
[1:02:05] say I sin what's your problem well if
[1:02:08] I'm tied up in him if I'm tied up in
[1:02:12] Christ if I'm dead in Christ there's no
[1:02:15] law that's going to condemn me a man I
[1:02:18] love that but now we are delivered from
[1:02:22] the law that being dead where when were
[1:02:25] in we were held that we should serve in
[1:02:28] newness of spirit and not in the oldest
[1:02:32] of the ladder why Paul because the
[1:02:33] letter killeth the letter is only going
[1:02:37] to condemn us but the Spirit is what
[1:02:40] giveth life the spirit of the letters
[1:02:43] that all right say man all right let's
[1:02:45] go to Romans 6 verse 6 knowing this that
[1:02:49] our old man is crucified with him now
[1:02:52] whose old man that's the old nature that
[1:02:54] you were born with that old man that
[1:02:56] attached itself to you because of the
[1:02:58] carnal lap between your mom and daddy
[1:03:00] you wasn't supposed to come that way so
[1:03:02] that's all contrary that's why we have
[1:03:04] to have a new birth jesus never told
[1:03:07] Nicodemus in Nicodemus me and you need a
[1:03:09] new birth no he said ye must be born
[1:03:12] again
[1:03:14] hey man so you know what if I put myself
[1:03:17] back on him that's the right birth
[1:03:22] Christ had to write birth that's why you
[1:03:25] didn't say Nicky they must we both need
[1:03:27] to be born again no he said Nicodemus
[1:03:28] you need to be born again because you'd
[1:03:29] born wrong I was born right the first
[1:03:32] time and I'm coming to right this wrong
[1:03:34] and you're not getting it
[1:03:37] you're going back carnal again that's
[1:03:40] our problem we go back carnal again
[1:03:42] knowing this that our old man is
[1:03:44] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:03:46] might be what destroyed destroyed when
[1:03:50] you destroy something it don't come back
[1:03:53] amen destroyed that henceforth we should
[1:03:59] not serve sin for he that is dead is
[1:04:02] freed from sin now in the natural aspect
[1:04:05] like brother Dale said you his father's
[1:04:08] been dead for 70 something years now if
[1:04:12] somebody robbed the bank two days ago
[1:04:14] and said Sam Dale robbed a bank number
[1:04:16] one they're lying and number two how you
[1:04:19] going to accuse his daddy of doing it
[1:04:21] why he's dead he's dead you can't accuse
[1:04:24] a dead person of anything amen
[1:04:27] that's why I like that song about the
[1:04:29] blind man that's the blind man he saw it
[1:04:31] all I like that song you saying that
[1:04:33] Aaron you're not song no sing it one
[1:04:36] time see twice if you want to write but
[1:04:41] that same way you know how are you dead
[1:04:43] after that person if we're dead in
[1:04:47] Christ ask me how I got dead amen ask me
[1:04:51] how I died I'll tell you how I died God
[1:04:55] kill the old a tried a man for he that
[1:04:58] is dead is freed from sin you ought to
[1:05:01] put that on your refrigerator now if we
[1:05:04] be dead with Christ we believe that we
[1:05:08] shall also live with him amen
[1:05:12] because remember like I said before the
[1:05:15] dead in Christ shall rise first those
[1:05:17] people are not dead in Christ like we
[1:05:19] think they're not dead in the grave man
[1:05:22] they're more alive than they ever have
[1:05:23] been
[1:05:24] they just got detached from their body
[1:05:26] and put into an
[1:05:27] other dimension waiting for me and you
[1:05:31] hello wave for me and you to come to a
[1:05:35] position and once we come to a position
[1:05:37] we read about it in a minute all right
[1:05:39] now look if we be dead with Christ we
[1:05:42] believe we also shall live with him now
[1:05:46] watch right here because we've been
[1:05:50] talking about the black horse rider and
[1:05:51] black meaning death but remember when
[1:05:56] you become a newborn babe in Christ a
[1:05:58] lot of times you can't explain things
[1:06:00] right I mean ask a baby how to drive a
[1:06:02] car they may want to but they don't they
[1:06:09] can't say get the keys and but you don't
[1:06:12] say I'm saying but they're a baby and
[1:06:16] then even a baby in Christ can explain
[1:06:18] certain things but you got to grow up in
[1:06:20] mature you got a mature to a level that
[1:06:23] we be dead in Christ we do believe it
[1:06:25] while shall live him he don't want a
[1:06:27] bunch of dead people laying dead but if
[1:06:30] you're dead in Christ you're alive
[1:06:31] you're more alive now than you ever have
[1:06:34] been if you're born again doesn't matter
[1:06:37] if it's taking us toward 80 years old or
[1:06:39] to the grave what does that matter
[1:06:41] that's just the shell that you live in
[1:06:44] amen if you're born again you're just as
[1:06:48] eternal as God is that's the position we
[1:06:53] got to realize that but what's going to
[1:06:56] happen when we come to here watch when
[1:06:59] we come to the fourth seal it names that
[1:07:02] person death it's been dead all along
[1:07:07] it's been death since it started here
[1:07:09] but it comes to a manifestation to where
[1:07:13] if the devil's manifested so much you
[1:07:17] know what he is and you know his name
[1:07:18] and the hell follows him that's a
[1:07:21] position all right you and I have to be
[1:07:25] the word manifested in a position to
[1:07:31] know when you come to church and a
[1:07:32] preacher preacher something to you you
[1:07:34] know how to name it
[1:07:38] you know how to name it that came from
[1:07:40] God or that came from the devil same way
[1:07:44] in your personal life I was telling the
[1:07:46] church this morning downstairs
[1:07:47] we told Mike the third pull we've been
[1:07:50] trying to make you the third push we've
[1:07:54] been trying to push people into it
[1:07:55] brother Kali why are you giggling about
[1:07:56] we've been making a third push because
[1:07:59] we've been trying to push people into
[1:08:00] stuff no it's the pull of God let God
[1:08:02] pull if you ever tried to push a rope
[1:08:04] really have you ever tried to push a
[1:08:06] rope you cannot get it to go where you
[1:08:09] want it to go no way you push it like
[1:08:12] this and it's like a snake it'll go over
[1:08:13] this way but you pull it guess where you
[1:08:15] pull it straight so the pull is God
[1:08:19] pulling us to be dead
[1:08:22] but to be dead we're to be more alive
[1:08:25] than we ever were amen
[1:08:29] so we're heading toward death but we're
[1:08:33] more alive than we ever have been what a
[1:08:35] paradox but when we become completely
[1:08:38] dead will manifest God and listen there
[1:08:45] is a place that you and I have to really
[1:08:47] know when we come and sit down and
[1:08:48] listen to somebody or when we listen to
[1:08:51] a preacher when we listen to something
[1:08:53] something rings inside of us that's true
[1:08:55] or that's not true
[1:08:57] and if it's never happened to you
[1:09:00] it will you'll have an aha moment aha
[1:09:04] right be sitting in a group of people of
[1:09:08] six hundred people and they're all
[1:09:09] shouting and praising God over a false
[1:09:10] doctrine and a whole row of being
[1:09:12] brother Dale and sister Dale in June and
[1:09:14] a couple other ministers that I won't
[1:09:16] name and that we're just sitting there
[1:09:17] we didn't shout in glory hallelujah why
[1:09:19] there was something inside of me sitting
[1:09:21] telling it right you know what I thank
[1:09:24] God for that
[1:09:25] you know what because I was dead I'm not
[1:09:29] saying him other ones was full of the
[1:09:31] devil
[1:09:31] I'm just saying they got caught up in an
[1:09:33] emotion hey man they got caught up in an
[1:09:36] emotion
[1:09:36] listen emotions would get you killed
[1:09:39] physically and spiritually but if you
[1:09:42] listen to what the preacher says and if
[1:09:43] it rings in your heart truth truth we'll
[1:09:47] have to agree with truth
[1:09:49] it's like the brown I'm sitting I want
[1:09:50] to say it either you're wrong and
[1:09:54] they're right or you're right in their
[1:09:57] room you both can't be right man
[1:10:01] let's just put it you both can't be
[1:10:02] right when it comes to the word of God
[1:10:04] you both can't be right
[1:10:06] there's a right and a wrong right so if
[1:10:08] we be dead in Christ then we shall live
[1:10:10] with him in other words what are we
[1:10:11] coming to we're coming to the part where
[1:10:13] Adam didn't have to call on God for
[1:10:15] everything he needed he was the god of
[1:10:19] the earth he was and had the mind of God
[1:10:25] that what he said happened amen
[1:10:32] I mean look at the manifestation that we
[1:10:35] have even in this building even in this
[1:10:38] church
[1:10:40] you got sisters that have fooled the
[1:10:42] holy ghost it like sister Barbara back
[1:10:45] there she talks too much man she just
[1:10:49] her and sister Jean could talk the ears
[1:10:53] off a donkey if the donkey didn't have
[1:10:56] any ears but not look they and look I'm
[1:11:00] just saying you know sister Barbara says
[1:11:02] why I'm so insignificant I just sit here
[1:11:04] but you know what she has eternal life
[1:11:06] she has a connection with the eternal
[1:11:09] hey man and you know what if Joe Bubba
[1:11:14] comes off and on the side of the road
[1:11:16] and sees sister acts this sees sister
[1:11:18] Barbara on the side of the road with her
[1:11:19] tire blown out you've heard me say this
[1:11:22] before I might say it again look count
[1:11:24] you said well I'm in an insignificant
[1:11:25] may have a preach the sermon
[1:11:27] I ain't never brought nobody to the Lord
[1:11:29] and here sister Barbara on the side of
[1:11:31] the road with a flat tire and Joe Bubba
[1:11:33] comes by and changes her tire for no
[1:11:36] reason no money he just comes by out of
[1:11:38] the goodness of his heart you know what
[1:11:39] he goes back home to his third divorced
[1:11:41] wife I'm gonna make it pretty bad he
[1:11:45] goes back home to his third divorced
[1:11:46] wife pops opening a beer and starts
[1:11:49] watching pornography I'm gonna make it
[1:11:52] really bad all right but do you know
[1:11:54] what on the day of judgment before the
[1:11:57] gavel goes down sister Barbara is gonna
[1:12:00] be in that crowd
[1:12:01] and she's gonna bring back to the memory
[1:12:03] Jesus already knows it
[1:12:05] he just wants her to have a part in it
[1:12:08] he wants her to be connected with the
[1:12:11] eternal life so sister Barbara way in
[1:12:13] the back you know everybody's talking
[1:12:15] you got millions of people everybody's
[1:12:16] talking just to probably says you know
[1:12:23] what he does he turns and he goes what
[1:12:25] sister what my child right before the
[1:12:29] gavel goes down Kojo baba knows he's
[1:12:31] dead and he's gone he's going to hell he
[1:12:33] never accepted Christ but before that
[1:12:35] gavel goes down sister barber says hold
[1:12:38] on a minute Lord you said you said that
[1:12:44] whatsoever it's done to my little ones
[1:12:50] it'll be doing it'll be done to me a cup
[1:12:54] of water will not be forgotten in this
[1:12:56] world Lord we're in the other world he
[1:13:01] was good to me and you know what the
[1:13:02] gavel goes down but you know what he
[1:13:04] said he says Joe baba because of her
[1:13:07] because of her enter into the joy of the
[1:13:10] Lord
[1:13:13] enjoy eternal life because of some
[1:13:16] person that didn't even think they could
[1:13:18] talk to anybody don't ever think you're
[1:13:22] insignificant if you're dead in Christ
[1:13:25] you're the most alive person ever lived
[1:13:27] on the face of the earth and then 10
[1:13:31] examples is gonna happen people that's
[1:13:34] not and that's not just an example that
[1:13:37] will happen at the day of judgment
[1:13:39] you'll never know it maybe sister
[1:13:42] Barbara probably will never you know if
[1:13:43] that ever happened she's just like old
[1:13:45] thank you you know let me pay you she
[1:13:47] goes on it probably forgets it but buddy
[1:13:48] when we get there she's in the body
[1:13:52] change she's got that fresh mind I'm not
[1:13:54] saying it's not fresh now but she's got
[1:13:56] the fresh mind she's like okay I'm oh
[1:13:58] I'm 60 something you're golden yeah I
[1:14:01] need today's your birthday that's right
[1:14:02] that's why I'm picking on you but you
[1:14:05] know her mind comes fresh she goes Lord
[1:14:09] that man change my tire Lord hang on
[1:14:14] hang on hold on
[1:14:15] and you know what he does he's real
[1:14:17] happy when that happens gotten you
[1:14:19] gotten you for advantage the world it's
[1:14:21] gonna happen but he wanted her to be a
[1:14:24] part of it so that's what a great God we
[1:14:26] got we got a great God that gives you
[1:14:29] eternal life and then you take that
[1:14:31] eternal life and you give it to somebody
[1:14:32] else and man but you can't be so full of
[1:14:36] yourself
[1:14:37] Dwight Moody says if you're too full of
[1:14:40] yourself God can't fill you all right so
[1:14:43] now let's talk about this because of
[1:14:44] this watch the Father's throne cuz see
[1:14:47] that's what happened with sister Barbara
[1:14:48] when she become a newborn babe in Christ
[1:14:51] the father came in and sit down on the
[1:14:53] throne of her heart amen
[1:14:55] is that right say man I'm talking about
[1:14:58] the eternal creator God comes in that's
[1:15:01] why she can impart eternal life that's
[1:15:04] why she can do what she does that's why
[1:15:06] you all can do what you do
[1:15:08] hey man lay your hands on the sick and
[1:15:10] they shall recover that didn't say men
[1:15:14] sisters - what about a great prophet
[1:15:17] standing up one day get rid him in a
[1:15:20] prayer line he looks down and he says
[1:15:22] ma'am your baby's already healed in
[1:15:24] other words I'm paraphrasing but you're
[1:15:26] your babies already he'll get so old
[1:15:29] that sister prayed for you why because
[1:15:32] that sister entered in brother when I'm
[1:15:33] cutting enter in as a woman or enter in
[1:15:35] as a mother but that mother entered in
[1:15:37] and intervened hello somebody intervened
[1:15:40] with God so it don't take a prophet
[1:15:43] always to intervene with God you can do
[1:15:46] that yourself but I want to ask you a
[1:15:48] question just like I asked those those
[1:15:50] guys last Sunday at the Methodist Church
[1:15:52] if you had a jury a judge and a
[1:15:56] prosecutor can they commit you of being
[1:15:58] a Christian my brother Dale said maybe
[1:16:03] some people don't want what we got
[1:16:04] because we don't act like what we should
[1:16:06] have and then John 14:6 Jesus said unto
[1:16:11] him I am the way the truth and the life
[1:16:13] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:16:16] if you had known me you should have
[1:16:18] known my father also and from henceforth
[1:16:22] you know him and have seen him what
[1:16:25] looks that pretty you've seen him
[1:16:29] Philip says hold on a minute
[1:16:32] I don't see your daddy right Philip
[1:16:38] saith unto Him Lord show us the father
[1:16:40] and it'll satisfy our what our brain
[1:16:46] it'll satisfy err you know because
[1:16:48] they're all probably going is he talking
[1:16:51] about Joseph oh yeah I don't see no
[1:16:53] other father because by that time Joseph
[1:16:55] was already dead his father is you know
[1:16:57] his father surrogate father or whatever
[1:16:59] you want to call him was already gone so
[1:17:01] they're like Jesus said to him have I
[1:17:04] been so long with you and yet hast thou
[1:17:07] not known me I ask you don't put Philips
[1:17:09] name in there put your name in there put
[1:17:13] your name in there because when we've
[1:17:18] been walking in this way we've been
[1:17:20] walking in you shouldn't know who that
[1:17:21] father is Amen that's the position we
[1:17:25] got to come to he that hath seen me hath
[1:17:28] seen the father and how say us they'll
[1:17:32] then show us the father believe us now
[1:17:34] not that I am in the father and the
[1:17:37] father in me the words that I speak unto
[1:17:40] you I speak not of myself but the father
[1:17:43] that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:17:46] in other words he was dead and the
[1:17:52] father was alive he went physically did
[1:17:56] you know that but that's why I don't
[1:17:58] agree with these people that said Jesus
[1:17:59] wasn't gone to the River Jordan because
[1:18:01] you got to separate two people he's not
[1:18:05] two people if he wasn't God when he was
[1:18:09] born where is that spirit and soul of
[1:18:12] that baby that was called Jesus but see
[1:18:18] that's different for me and you though
[1:18:19] we can see that in our life but not
[1:18:22] Jesus Christ not the one that came here
[1:18:24] listen the Bible I don't need a quote
[1:18:26] all I need the Bible to tell me the
[1:18:28] Bible says he was born Emmanuel God with
[1:18:31] us now don't need no more I don't need
[1:18:34] another quote I don't need somebody to
[1:18:36] preach me to our sermon the Bible says
[1:18:40] he was born Emmanuel
[1:18:41] God with us I'm done he was God when he
[1:18:44] was born or he was some other person and
[1:18:47] that some other person couldn't die for
[1:18:50] me and you definitely that person could
[1:18:52] not die and give us eternal life because
[1:18:55] brother Graham said he said it's not one
[1:18:57] man can die for another yeah you know I
[1:18:59] can give my life for brother I'll but I
[1:19:03] can't take what I got and put my life
[1:19:07] which would have been eternal life in
[1:19:09] Jesus's spot and put it in him I just
[1:19:11] died for him and I become a hero and you
[1:19:14] know they honor me but what about a man
[1:19:17] that could die that says I'm coming back
[1:19:19] and when I come back I'm not gonna come
[1:19:22] back in flesh yet I'm gonna come back in
[1:19:24] your flesh and then I'm gonna come back
[1:19:26] in spirit form and I'm going to go into
[1:19:28] all these believers and you know what
[1:19:32] I'm gonna do the same work
[1:19:34] I believe won't you know what the Bible
[1:19:36] says now let's go to revelations 3 then
[1:19:40] we'll make a few comments and be
[1:19:41] finished as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:19:46] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[1:19:49] now this is out this is Laodicean Church
[1:19:54] age this is our church age revelations
[1:19:56] 3:14 is our church age all right so he's
[1:20:00] talking to you and me right now as many
[1:20:03] as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[1:20:05] zealous therefore and repent behold I
[1:20:07] stand at the door and knock
[1:20:09] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:20:10] door I will come in to him and will sup
[1:20:12] with him and he with me
[1:20:14] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:20:17] sit with me
[1:20:18] that doesn't say own that doesn't say
[1:20:23] own because they are physically sitting
[1:20:27] on this bench but there's no human way
[1:20:31] that they can be sitting in the bench
[1:20:34] unless they become the bench huh unless
[1:20:41] they become the bench
[1:20:42] that's what Jesus is saying I will grant
[1:20:46] to sit
[1:20:47] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:20:49] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:20:54] overcame
[1:20:55] what do you overcome Wow
[1:20:59] hmm he got eternal life in the body amen
[1:21:03] and sit down with my father
[1:21:06] let me read again to him that overcometh
[1:21:07] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:21:09] even as I also overcame and I'm sit down
[1:21:12] with my father in his throne so he's not
[1:21:16] talking about a physical throne he's
[1:21:18] talking about a position a position
[1:21:21] listen let's be honest a king a king
[1:21:27] doesn't need a throne to sit on even a
[1:21:30] physical King doesn't need one now they
[1:21:32] have them because some of them get big
[1:21:33] in their head but a real King out to me
[1:21:36] a real King I'm kind of like that if I
[1:21:38] if I was a king you'd never know it
[1:21:40] because we're servants and that's what
[1:21:43] Jesus was he didn't and you know sure we
[1:21:46] exalt him because of what he did for us
[1:21:48] amen but he just assumed not have a
[1:21:50] physical throne to go sit down on and
[1:21:55] then so it's not that there's a physical
[1:21:58] throne somewhere because it's in my
[1:21:59] throne now what is it in what a kingdom
[1:22:02] you're in the kingdom these people are
[1:22:05] in the kingdom of God the Father's
[1:22:09] throne I'll read it in a minute is the
[1:22:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost he that hath
[1:22:15] an ear let him hear what the Spirit says
[1:22:16] to the churches alright let's go to the
[1:22:18] next let's go to quote number two now
[1:22:21] watch this mm-hmm this is the first seal
[1:22:24] now watch he said it would be known in
[1:22:26] the last day but it comes forth in a
[1:22:28] church symbol do you understand a church
[1:22:29] it comes forth in the symbol of a church
[1:22:32] that they know there is a seal we know
[1:22:35] the seal the wild horse rider the red
[1:22:37] horse rider right we know the seal all
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:41] y'all done pretty good you're not
[1:22:42] falling asleep much yet those of you
[1:22:45] that didn't hear me well you're setting
[1:22:47] up here where I got a hold of you now
[1:22:54] there is a seal but just what it is yet
[1:22:57] they don't know because it's a wild
[1:22:58] horse rider I think we broke that I
[1:23:01] don't see me I think we in your mind you
[1:23:04] know that that seal was wildfires
[1:23:06] Antichrist but underneath that there's a
[1:23:08] whole lot
[1:23:09] I'm an an underneath that is for me the
[1:23:14] justification that comes under the first
[1:23:15] seal and it only to be revealed at the
[1:23:18] last day when this actual seal is broken
[1:23:20] broken to who not to cross now watch
[1:23:25] what's what hold on man watch look at me
[1:23:27] watch the position change in this one
[1:23:30] quote right here broken to who not to
[1:23:33] cross but to the church hold on a minute
[1:23:37] brother branham the whole church because
[1:23:41] remember the church can brought you
[1:23:42] different things watch watching notice
[1:23:46] now oh my that just makes me tremble I
[1:23:49] hope that the church truly understands
[1:23:53] it see what I mean you people I'm going
[1:23:57] to call you bride see that you'll
[1:24:00] understand it he's talking to the bride
[1:24:03] amen not the church he's talking to the
[1:24:06] bride the voice is a thunder the voice
[1:24:10] came from where from the throne now here
[1:24:13] we are
[1:24:13] this is revelations five from the throne
[1:24:17] where the lamb had just left as
[1:24:19] intercessor now he's standing here to
[1:24:22] take his position and his claims but the
[1:24:27] Thunder came from inside of the throne
[1:24:32] not old inside of the throne thundered
[1:24:39] out and the lamb was standing than a
[1:24:42] watch watch this position change because
[1:24:46] there's got to be a position change from
[1:24:48] the church ages to what we're doing now
[1:24:52] thanks for being silent or asleep would
[1:24:55] you want the thunder where the lamb had
[1:24:59] left left the Father's throne to go take
[1:25:05] his own throne glory now now don't miss
[1:25:09] it friends we all know as Christians
[1:25:13] that God swore to David that he will
[1:25:14] raise up Christ a settlement strong give
[1:25:16] it an everlasting Kingdom here on the
[1:25:18] earth he did it jesus said he that
[1:25:20] overcome the Antichrist and all the
[1:25:21] things of the world
[1:25:22] sit with Mina he says ohm but it's in my
[1:25:25] throne as I have over come and sit down
[1:25:27] on my father stone see now some day he
[1:25:30] rises from the Father's throne and takes
[1:25:35] his own throne now there's a position
[1:25:39] change same person but it's a position
[1:25:43] change he goes to take his own throne
[1:25:47] now he comes forth to call his subjects
[1:25:52] now look he's called look at me he's
[1:25:55] called his subjects all down through him
[1:25:57] but he's called them into another
[1:26:00] dimension death has taken over here and
[1:26:04] he just preserved them and pushed them
[1:26:06] over into another dimension six
[1:26:07] dimension right
[1:26:08] were there eternal but they're not
[1:26:10] complete remember they told brother
[1:26:12] Branham we don't need over here we're
[1:26:14] not complete we got to come back I mean
[1:26:16] they were explaining to him what they
[1:26:18] had to do right how is he going to know
[1:26:21] what notice some day he rises from the
[1:26:23] Father's throne he goes to take his own
[1:26:25] throne now he comes forth to call his
[1:26:28] subjects how's he going to claim them
[1:26:31] he's already got the book of redemption
[1:26:34] in his hand what are the seals the seals
[1:26:38] is a complete book of redemption right
[1:26:40] all right hey man so that was a position
[1:26:43] change to watch now we're going to go to
[1:26:44] the third seal number three steel we're
[1:26:48] on now brother Brad was reviewing but
[1:26:51] watch what he says and then we went back
[1:26:53] and got the kinsman redeemer and picked
[1:26:55] him up to see what his work was and now
[1:26:57] for all these years
[1:26:58] Christ has been doing that kinsman
[1:27:01] redeemer work that's the Holy Ghost in
[1:27:04] your soul he's been doing the kinsmen
[1:27:07] wrought work right now all that
[1:27:11] understands say Amen he has been doing
[1:27:13] the work of the kinsman redeemer but
[1:27:16] there will come a time that when the
[1:27:18] redeeming work will be over and when the
[1:27:21] redeeming work is over then he leaves
[1:27:24] the throne of God where he seated now
[1:27:28] but that's not his throne our Dominion
[1:27:34] because I know what you're doing
[1:27:36] in your mind you see a throne a physical
[1:27:39] place for somebody to sit don't think
[1:27:42] that don't think that but that's not his
[1:27:50] throne he that overcometh she'll sit
[1:27:52] with me in they get you right here in my
[1:27:54] throne as I have over come and sit down
[1:27:56] on my Father's throne
[1:27:57] that is not his throne that belongs
[1:28:00] there watch I want you to watch the way
[1:28:03] he said this that is not his throne that
[1:28:07] belongs to spirit , guard enough stop
[1:28:12] that's the Father's throne
[1:28:14] alright the Father's throne it's what
[1:28:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:28:20] because I'm gonna read it on the next
[1:28:22] one on the mighty God in Vail before us
[1:28:24] he's gonna explain what he's talking
[1:28:25] about that belongs to spirit guard stop
[1:28:28] Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him
[1:28:31] that's Louisiana watch he is the
[1:28:35] Incarnate God which is the same God made
[1:28:37] incarnate now he's talking about another
[1:28:39] throne go that's the front that's the
[1:28:42] son of man when you put God incarnate
[1:28:44] that's the son of man and then the lamb
[1:28:49] when you say the lamb you're talking
[1:28:52] about son of man cuz that's guarding
[1:28:56] human flesh and then it doesn't belong
[1:28:59] to him what this throne up here it
[1:29:01] belongs to the father he is the
[1:29:04] Incarnate God which is the same God made
[1:29:06] incarnate now goes the next quote I
[1:29:08] should have probably put it first
[1:29:10] mighty gon unveiled before us then we
[1:29:12] find after his death burial resurrection
[1:29:13] he comes under day of Pentecost as son
[1:29:16] of God so now during the church ages by
[1:29:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he comes
[1:29:25] and dwells in your soul as the son of
[1:29:28] God's Spirit God to give you the new
[1:29:31] birth but he's not finished
[1:29:33] that just gets him started God the
[1:29:38] Spirit in the form Holy Ghost what was
[1:29:42] he doing he was changing himself making
[1:29:46] himself known to his people in a
[1:29:48] different form
[1:29:50] like the Holy Spirit which is God he
[1:29:53] came to deal through the church ages as
[1:29:55] son of God the Holy Spirit all right but
[1:29:59] now remember just in that form people
[1:30:04] die go by the grave
[1:30:06] hey man it's just a cycle because we got
[1:30:10] to get this flesh redeemed we got to get
[1:30:14] it to where this flesh becomes redeemed
[1:30:15] because Jesus's flesh was redeemed
[1:30:18] brother Dale talk about this morning
[1:30:20] amen all right let's go to number 5 just
[1:30:24] for a second I think this is the last
[1:30:25] quote this days of scripture fulfilled
[1:30:29] 1965 all right everybody awake five more
[1:30:35] minutes
[1:30:35] like that see he came in three names now
[1:30:42] I want you to watch what he says we've
[1:30:44] been through this before brother Dale's
[1:30:45] preach taunting many many times he come
[1:30:48] in three sons names but remember there's
[1:30:50] really four it's really four but it's
[1:30:58] the son of man twice got it cuz watch
[1:31:02] the position is why I'm telling you
[1:31:03] there's got to be a position change when
[1:31:05] we come out of this third seal when that
[1:31:07] third seal open to me it showed a
[1:31:10] position change it showed a change that
[1:31:13] well now what we're going to do is the
[1:31:15] words gonna be manifested like it's
[1:31:16] never been before but look he came in
[1:31:19] three names he came as the Son of Man
[1:31:20] which was prophet that's what he did he
[1:31:23] proved his ministry by being a prophet
[1:31:25] we all know that every one of us knows
[1:31:27] it he never said he was the son of God
[1:31:30] remember he never they said they'll be
[1:31:31] the son of God he says son of man son of
[1:31:33] man son a minute son of man why because
[1:31:35] he was God manifested in human flesh
[1:31:37] that's what son of man is all right he
[1:31:40] never said he was the son of God he said
[1:31:42] he was the son of man now today he is
[1:31:45] the son of God so he went from Son of
[1:31:48] man to Son of God
[1:31:49] nobody got that say man he went from son
[1:31:53] of man to son of God now today he is the
[1:31:57] son of God so now when he said today he
[1:31:59] meant still in this church age Amen
[1:32:03] which he returned
[1:32:04] back and now he's in the form of the
[1:32:06] Holy Ghost the unseen person but yet God
[1:32:09] the Son of God all right so we went from
[1:32:12] son of man to son of God now we're
[1:32:14] fixing to go to son of David but watch
[1:32:16] him he backs up in a minute and gives
[1:32:19] you one little key that you gotta have
[1:32:23] he revealed himself first son of man
[1:32:26] prophet this age through the church age
[1:32:28] son of man or son of God he corrects
[1:32:30] himself I'm sorry in the Millennium he
[1:32:34] sits upon his Father's throne which
[1:32:35] would be the son of David
[1:32:38] remember he promised David he'd have a
[1:32:41] throne everlasting throne he'll he'll
[1:32:43] judge the twelve tribes of Israel during
[1:32:45] the Millennium my man he revealed
[1:32:48] himself first a son of man a prophet
[1:32:51] this age through the church age son of
[1:32:54] man or son of God and in the other age
[1:32:56] son of David three sons but watch but
[1:32:59] you notice here he said at the ending of
[1:33:01] the church age it had got in such a mess
[1:33:05] well he would be revealed again a man as
[1:33:10] son of man when the son of man is being
[1:33:14] revealed how appropriate was that mix-up
[1:33:16] yesterday now he's preaching on this day
[1:33:20] the scripture fulfilled remember with a
[1:33:21] priest giving the Bible and you read the
[1:33:23] scripture about the mix-up yesterday and
[1:33:26] I hope you don't miss it we have had the
[1:33:29] revelation of son of God but the last
[1:33:32] promise that Abraham had before the son
[1:33:35] was made or brought into existence the
[1:33:37] one he had promised before the promised
[1:33:39] son showed up God manifested himself
[1:33:42] there at Sodom as a prophet being a man
[1:33:45] in flesh God Elohim so the position had
[1:33:50] to come back to the Son of man because
[1:33:54] the son of man needs to be here for the
[1:33:55] body change saying God don't need a body
[1:33:58] change it's the same person but you got
[1:34:01] to look at the position that we're in it
[1:34:03] wasn't required here but once this seal
[1:34:06] opens and we see that we're in a
[1:34:08] position now because I'm telling you
[1:34:10] when we get done and get out of here
[1:34:12] it's all done for the Gentiles we're
[1:34:16] done when we take a rapture when that
[1:34:17] says right
[1:34:19] we're done we're finished we've went
[1:34:23] through a resurrection we went wait a
[1:34:25] minute we've went through a third Pole
[1:34:27] we've been through adoption we went
[1:34:29] through manifested sons of God which is
[1:34:31] adoption we went through the call of the
[1:34:33] dead out of the ground we went through
[1:34:35] the we which are alive and remain to the
[1:34:37] coming of the Lord ain't nothing left
[1:34:41] for us we're heading toward that now
[1:34:43] when that fourth seal breaks we leave we
[1:34:48] leave that neck sealed when we see that
[1:34:51] seal it leaves so look listen to this
[1:34:54] this was a me quote when he comes to son
[1:34:58] of man he was a king with no subjects
[1:35:02] right I just told you there was nobody
[1:35:04] in his kingdom except him he told pilots
[1:35:08] the truth he said if I had subjects dead
[1:35:09] fire that even the disciples weren't his
[1:35:12] subjects not at that moment but when he
[1:35:15] come back on the day of Pentecost he was
[1:35:17] a king with subjects hey man now he
[1:35:22] comes back to the Son of man he's now
[1:35:25] king in flesh your flesh my flesh and
[1:35:32] then he'll go to the son of David he'll
[1:35:36] be to the Jews I came to them in the
[1:35:39] Millennium but you and I are gonna have
[1:35:42] to be dead you and I are gonna have to
[1:35:47] be totally dead xed out nothing left of
[1:35:52] us let's Stan
[1:36:01] exit out that third seal when you really
[1:36:07] see that third seal man you've come to a
[1:36:09] place to where a position has changed
[1:36:14] because brother Branham wasn't the son
[1:36:17] of man he was a son of man revealing the
[1:36:21] son of man we'll get into that next
[1:36:22] we'll get into that next in a couple of
[1:36:24] weeks because when we come to that seal
[1:36:27] number four it brings all this together
[1:36:30] all the revelations are finished like
[1:36:34] that third pull all the great
[1:36:36] revelations that we're looking for when
[1:36:37] that fourth seal breaks and we see these
[1:36:39] things happening it will be finished the
[1:36:44] Gentile age will be no more and God will
[1:36:48] return to the Jews they won't be one
[1:36:50] let's all stand and come to y'all come
[1:36:52] to the musicians come there'll be
[1:36:55] nothing left for the Gentiles folks but
[1:36:58] judgment you know why because the
[1:37:02] kingdom of God is left the kingdom of
[1:37:06] gods go the kingdom that he had down
[1:37:09] here that he established on the earth he
[1:37:10] came to establish it will be in another
[1:37:14] position or in another dimension and
[1:37:18] then they can wipe this place off all
[1:37:21] they want to but you know why they're
[1:37:23] wiping it off they're wiping it off so
[1:37:25] God can come back on the earth well you
[1:37:27] know what let God's like brother Brennan
[1:37:29] said let God's atomic-bomb
[1:37:32] faith blow us up I want to be done away
[1:37:39] with I want to be eradicated I want to
[1:37:42] be totally dead that's their problem
[1:37:46] like Dwight Moody said garden will only
[1:37:48] fill those who are not full of themself
[1:37:50] so we want to be totally empty we see
[1:37:54] this seal come to a to a close and get
[1:37:56] ready to open the fourth seal that third
[1:37:58] seal it's very important cuz that
[1:37:59] position of the new birds if you don't
