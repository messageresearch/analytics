[19:10] lord
[19:11] we pray now that you just sanctified for
[19:13] this journey lord
[19:15] we've all had our hands up lord with
[19:17] many requests and i pray lord that each
[19:19] request
[19:20] will be mentioned not so much mentioned
[19:23] by the word
[19:24] being preached of that exact word but as
[19:26] the word goes forth someone will catch
[19:28] something and say that ain't nothing but
[19:30] the truth
[19:31] and then you can take that and and hold
[19:33] on to it and take it with you in your
[19:35] daily walk lord thank you for all the
[19:37] things you've given us forgive us of our
[19:39] sins and bless us in jesus name
[19:42] amen john 1 1 says in the beginning was
[19:44] the word word was with god and the word
[19:46] was god
[19:47] and that word was made flesh
[19:50] and dwelt among us and we behold beheld
[19:52] his glory as the glory of the only
[19:54] begotten of the father full of grace and
[19:56] truth you may be seated in the lord as
[19:57] blessing
[19:58] to the reading of the word
[20:00] and first thessalonians we were talking
[20:01] about sunday
[20:02] we'll get back on to this i was thinking
[20:04] about something a couple days ago about
[20:07] continuing on and i haven't got ready to
[20:10] get to start with the virtues because
[20:12] that big old thing down there says faith
[20:14] and it's a big old wide foundation so
[20:16] we're gonna have to preach a little bit
[20:17] wider
[20:18] a little bit wider foundation to get
[20:20] where we need to go
[20:22] before we can have virtue before we can
[20:24] have the knowledge of god the virtue of
[20:26] god we have to come under a place to
[20:28] where like i say in sunday the holy of
[20:30] holies is where we need to be
[20:32] but we don't need to stay in that holy
[20:34] of holies we got to come back out live
[20:35] our life
[20:36] then we got to go back through that
[20:39] second stage again of justification
[20:41] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[20:43] as if you never did it you die daily and
[20:45] the anointing of the baptism of the holy
[20:47] ghost to make you
[20:50] to make your mind to renew your mind to
[20:53] take it over to the part that where god
[20:55] wants you to see these not in a natural
[20:58] form but in a spiritual form but you got
[20:59] to apply it naturally
[21:01] all right everybody with me you gotta
[21:02] apply it naturally but it comes in a
[21:03] spiritual form
[21:05] because if you look up the word virtue
[21:07] it's just virtue means virtues live a
[21:09] virgin life that's not what it is you
[21:10] can be a virgin every day of your life
[21:12] and die and go to hell
[21:13] but you can't have the virtue of god and
[21:16] that strength coming out of you
[21:18] and dying that i said the virtue of god
[21:22] going out forth from you
[21:24] that means you're born again all right
[21:27] first thessalonians says that every one
[21:28] of you should know how to possess his
[21:29] vessel that's what we're doing we're
[21:31] learning how to possess our vessel i
[21:33] hope we all in this
[21:34] in this um 55 parts now we've we've
[21:37] learned a little bit about the new birth
[21:40] we've learned about justification we've
[21:41] learned about sanctification we've
[21:43] learned about about more about the
[21:45] baptism of the holy ghost i've learned
[21:47] more since i've started speaking than i
[21:50] knew before so
[21:51] it's not for just y'all it's for all of
[21:53] us it starts from here and goes back
[21:55] that way
[21:56] that every one of you should know how to
[21:57] possess his vessel in sanctification
[22:00] and honor romans 12 verse 2 says be not
[22:03] conformed to this world
[22:04] but be transformed by what the renewing
[22:07] of your mind not your neighbor's mind
[22:09] not your wife's mind your mind
[22:11] so it's an individual affair with god
[22:13] it's you and god alone in that holy of
[22:15] holies and he has transformed there is
[22:17] no way
[22:18] i don't believe there is no way that uh
[22:21] that a high priest could go in that holy
[22:23] of holies and be the same person when he
[22:25] walked out
[22:27] he was in the presence of something
[22:28] supernatural he was in the presence of
[22:30] something he'd never felt that presence
[22:32] before he was in the presence of
[22:34] something that what changed his life and
[22:36] the life of a nation
[22:38] amen
[22:39] so the renewing of your mind that what
[22:40] that you may prove
[22:43] listen god's going to prove it but he's
[22:45] going to prove it through you
[22:47] he's going to prove his word through you
[22:49] if not it's just dead letters on the
[22:51] page
[22:52] all right nobody with me that you may
[22:54] prove what is that good and acceptable
[22:58] that priest had to be acceptable as he
[23:00] went through he was accepted here he was
[23:03] accepted here he had all the clothes he
[23:05] had to put on and then he was accepted
[23:07] by one man only and that was god in the
[23:09] holy of holies all right
[23:12] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[23:14] god
[23:15] hebrews 4 verse 15 this is where we were
[23:19] looking at the
[23:20] we'll look at in just a minute
[23:22] for we have not on high priest which
[23:24] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[23:25] our infirmities but was in all points
[23:28] tempted like we are
[23:30] yet without sin
[23:31] let us therefore come boldly into the
[23:33] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[23:35] and find grace to help
[23:37] in time of need now something changed
[23:40] from that old testament where only one
[23:43] person could go in
[23:46] and the whole nation had to depend on
[23:47] that one person to go in to where now it
[23:50] switched over to where now the curtain
[23:52] the veil has been rent every person that
[23:55] does not go in
[23:57] is doomed
[23:58] all right so something changed so what
[24:00] changed
[24:01] i believe it came in that rod
[24:05] there's a reason that rod was put in
[24:07] that art now we read why it was put in
[24:09] the ark
[24:10] but the bible tells us and we'll read in
[24:12] just a few minutes that we're promised a
[24:15] rod to come out of the stem of jesse
[24:20] a lineage of humanity because i was
[24:24] looking at brother branham in 1955
[24:25] brother brown said on the message the
[24:27] art he said wood always speaks of
[24:29] humanity
[24:32] so there was the there was the wood wood
[24:34] speaks of humanity
[24:36] so let's look at the only way to get
[24:38] there though is by the new birth you
[24:39] can't jump from the from the curtain on
[24:42] the outside and just jump your way all
[24:44] the way through you can't get in
[24:46] because it's sheltered it's covered it's
[24:48] a secret it's a mystery
[24:50] but that mystery is not a mystery if
[24:52] you've walked through into the number
[24:53] two court if you walk to number three
[24:55] court it's not a mystery anymore christ
[24:57] is the mystery of god revealed he's the
[24:59] one that you got to go meet and once you
[25:01] meet him it shouldn't be a mystery
[25:03] anymore amen
[25:05] so now let's start
[25:07] we know the first stage of this whole
[25:08] thing we've been talking about it for 50
[25:10] sermons is the birth for as many as are
[25:12] led by the spirit of god they are the
[25:14] sons of god
[25:17] those people were israelites
[25:20] for you have not received the spirit of
[25:22] bondage against fear but you have
[25:23] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[25:25] you cry
[25:27] have a father now that's
[25:29] that's baby form all that we've been
[25:30] talking about justification
[25:32] sanctification that's the outer court
[25:33] the inner court the holy of holies you
[25:35] were born again in the holy of holies
[25:37] but you're not going to stay there
[25:39] because now there's a new and living way
[25:41] you're not going to stay there you're
[25:42] going to come out
[25:43] and you're going to declare that you
[25:46] need to go back there
[25:47] you need to go back there
[25:50] you need to have the new birth you need
[25:52] to have what i got
[25:54] amen thereby all right
[25:58] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[26:00] our spirit that we are the children of
[26:03] god listen that high priest didn't
[26:04] become a high priest when he got to
[26:06] number three
[26:09] it was required he was already a high
[26:10] priest
[26:11] it was required that he started living a
[26:13] better life so he started he had a
[26:15] renewing of his mind he he had his
[26:17] clothes changed
[26:20] hey man he had his clothes changed he
[26:22] had to change from just common clothes
[26:23] and put on the right kind of clothes the
[26:25] right color had to be together it had to
[26:27] be made with holy hands we read it and
[26:29] then he had to walk a certain way where
[26:31] the pomegranates and the bells were holy
[26:33] ding ding
[26:34] ding ding
[26:36] ding ding
[26:39] and everybody was listening to it
[26:44] and when it stopped
[26:47] he was either in front of god
[26:49] or he was dead
[26:51] then all of a sudden
[26:52] you hear him in just a few minutes
[26:58] amazing grace how sweet
[27:02] the sound i bet he came out of that
[27:03] thing
[27:04] not like some of y'all bunch of cypuses
[27:07] he probably come out of there going
[27:09] i've been with god
[27:11] i have met god face to face in there now
[27:14] moses pretty common to him he's meant
[27:16] god lip to ear face to face and he's
[27:18] talked to god all the time but this one
[27:20] individual
[27:22] whether it be aaron whether it be his
[27:24] sons or whether it be different ones the
[27:25] lineage of levite only one guy got to go
[27:28] back in there
[27:30] and he had to go through all kind i was
[27:31] reading it
[27:32] today i think it was that's all the
[27:34] things you had to they didn't just say
[27:36] all right boy it's your year to be the
[27:38] high priest
[27:39] no no no you had to go through
[27:42] stages
[27:44] you had to prove yourself
[27:46] you had to make yourself available you
[27:48] had to do certain things
[27:49] you had to do things right do it the
[27:51] right way
[27:53] because if you didn't do it right what
[27:55] was it it was death
[27:57] it was literal death for them now you
[27:59] and i come to this thing called
[28:00] spiritual death we can be just as alive
[28:03] as we want to and be spiritually dead
[28:05] but that high priest his very
[28:07] breathable human life
[28:10] was in jeopardy if he was wrong when he
[28:12] went behind that holy of holies
[28:14] all right but see by grace he didn't
[28:16] have a sure he had a a grace covering
[28:18] but not like me and you
[28:20] he'd have a grace covering like we have
[28:22] a grace covering
[28:23] we have a grace covering that if we do
[28:25] make a mistake come on people you think
[28:28] if you do make a mistake you're still
[28:30] you're still able to go to the holy of
[28:32] holies you're still able to go behind
[28:34] the veil
[28:36] amen because somebody the supreme high
[28:39] priest
[28:42] went there for you
[28:45] he just laid that grace veil down
[28:47] and like what i said about the the water
[28:49] coming down you know the blood he walked
[28:52] and you to get to it you got to walk
[28:53] through it
[28:54] amen
[28:56] and if children they are the heirs of
[28:57] god and join heirs with christ if so be
[28:59] that we suffer with him
[29:00] that we may be also glorified
[29:03] together i want us all to be glorified
[29:05] together i was thinking about the
[29:07] uh when we were baptizing sister sharon
[29:08] last saturday
[29:10] i didn't want us i want us all to be
[29:12] baptized i want us all to be filled with
[29:13] the holy ghost and i want us all to be
[29:16] living breathing instrumentalities of
[29:18] god everybody
[29:20] even those who either sat there like
[29:21] this
[29:24] something's gotta
[29:26] stir somewhere
[29:28] but you know what it can't be stirred
[29:30] unless it's planted
[29:31] that's why i want to talk to these
[29:33] people
[29:34] i was listening to another preacher
[29:35] watching the other day you know
[29:37] he was preaching again on the seed and
[29:40] how that all the seeds in genesis
[29:42] were laying in the ground
[29:45] well that's okay that's creation
[29:49] but that's not me i want to be like
[29:51] matthew
[29:53] matthew said a sower went to soul seed
[29:57] the sower was the son of man the only
[30:00] way you're going to get the new birth is
[30:01] know who jesus christ is
[30:04] and he's the one that sows the word it's
[30:06] not that the word was already in you and
[30:08] he just walks up to you and
[30:10] [Music]
[30:12] and this thing comes to life
[30:14] no
[30:16] no
[30:17] why did he tell the parable why did he
[30:19] just tell the parable here stands us a
[30:21] sower and here stands the devil
[30:24] no remember son of man is throwing seed
[30:26] seed is what seed is the word of god
[30:28] he's planting the word of god
[30:31] satan's planting his word
[30:34] god's people's coming up satan's people
[30:36] are coming up
[30:38] they weren't there they had to be sown
[30:40] in you got to have the words sewn in
[30:42] your soul
[30:44] got to come through the outlets up here
[30:46] and then it's what goes into your ground
[30:48] your fertile ground
[30:50] your humanity
[30:52] as we're going to talk about this
[30:53] afternoon for a minute
[30:54] brother bob i couldn't get away from the
[30:56] from the rod i just i just kept listen
[30:59] you know and what you can see all down
[31:01] through here
[31:02] you know even the bible says spare the
[31:04] rod spoil the child but you remember one
[31:05] thing when we get to it we think we
[31:08] think that is a rod
[31:10] of correction how do you correct
[31:12] somebody
[31:14] by jesus christ
[31:16] the rod that came out of the stem of
[31:18] jesse is how you correct your children
[31:20] yeah they need to have a little
[31:22] protoplasmic stimulation as brother
[31:24] brown said
[31:26] that means a spanking and i doubt you
[31:28] ever got one
[31:31] you either you either you either and you
[31:33] either and
[31:35] maybe them four back there was next to
[31:37] ryan may maybe
[31:38] gabby's pretty tough
[31:41] i'm blaming her not you blaming her
[31:44] gabby's going
[31:48] a model couple
[31:50] they keep their kids in line
[31:58] but instead of envying them we
[32:01] that never mind whatever
[32:02] then the nvm we talk about them
[32:05] that's kind of the way the devil is you
[32:06] know
[32:08] you get a holy ghost-filled person doing
[32:09] something right and you always got the
[32:10] devil going yeah but
[32:13] yeah but what
[32:15] so anyway we'll get to it in a minute
[32:17] so justification is what the outer court
[32:19] sanctification is the inner court
[32:22] and then the holy of holies and we'll
[32:24] look at it in a minute
[32:25] is
[32:26] the new birth there's always
[32:28] three is perfection is that correct
[32:31] seven is completion three is perfection
[32:33] so god is perfected and three's the
[32:35] prophet of god tells us there's a
[32:36] three-room house that we live in what
[32:38] kitchen
[32:39] living room bedroom everybody with me
[32:42] all right also there's what
[32:44] justification sanctification in the
[32:46] baptism of the holy ghost we can't do
[32:48] without any of those
[32:50] can't skip one
[32:52] you can be at a certain one but you
[32:54] can't skip one to get to the other
[32:57] how can you be sanctified if god hasn't
[32:59] already forgive you of your past
[33:03] think about it
[33:04] and how can he give you the baptism of
[33:06] the holy ghost if he hasn't got rid of
[33:07] your sin
[33:09] amen
[33:10] he won't dwell in an unclean vessel he's
[33:12] not going to just come and just go i'm
[33:14] in here
[33:15] no there's a process that we have to go
[33:17] through
[33:18] we have to go through we thank god for a
[33:20] prophet that told us what a body was and
[33:22] in five senses and what his spirit was
[33:24] with five senses and what a soul was
[33:26] with faith or doubt one one sense
[33:29] somebody said the soul doesn't have two
[33:31] senses it's one
[33:33] faith or doubt not faith and doubt
[33:36] because until you're born again you
[33:38] doubt everything
[33:40] amen
[33:44] that old critical spirit gosh i hate
[33:45] that thing
[33:49] can't find nothing good about nothing
[33:53] we win a million-dollar lottery and
[33:55] think you should have won the billion
[33:57] dollar one
[33:59] out of court inner court and holy of
[34:01] holies you've got an outer court we'll
[34:02] look at a min an inner court and a holy
[34:04] holies as you go further toward god it
[34:08] gets more secret
[34:10] everybody with me it gets more intimate
[34:13] it gets more close because outer court
[34:16] there's just hundreds of people walking
[34:17] around
[34:18] hundreds of animals being sacrificed and
[34:21] probably hundreds of high a priest
[34:24] then you've got a certain amount of high
[34:26] priest though that go into the next
[34:28] court
[34:29] curtain falls
[34:30] but remember it's got candlesticks it's
[34:33] got shoe bread it's got altar of incense
[34:37] then you've got in a holy of holies
[34:38] you've got one thing
[34:41] you've got one thing but inside that one
[34:43] thing is three things
[34:45] everybody with me
[34:47] inside this one thing
[34:51] there's three things
[34:53] the word
[34:55] the manna which brother brown just said
[34:56] was the top of the holy ghost all right
[34:58] right
[35:01] and your humanity
[35:03] this is what ties you to this whole
[35:05] thing
[35:06] not this
[35:07] this ties you to it
[35:10] wood represents humanity why did they
[35:13] put wood
[35:14] that's not wood that come from heaven
[35:16] that's manna god created that
[35:18] man did not in nowhere in any restaurant
[35:21] has this ever been created
[35:24] brother brown said it had everything you
[35:26] needed
[35:27] everything they needed
[35:28] for their journey
[35:32] and how can lord can you do without the
[35:33] word
[35:35] the ten commandment was the word of god
[35:37] brother brown said the seals
[35:38] god wrote these on a mountain
[35:41] wrote them with his finger
[35:44] and pulled them out and said here take
[35:46] these down there
[35:48] and give them to the people
[35:49] so inside this ark there's three
[35:52] three things everybody with me
[35:55] all right
[35:56] so i give you a new spirit so the second
[35:58] realm or justification you go in there
[36:00] and there's the shoe bread shoe bread
[36:02] altar of incense
[36:04] seven golden candlesticks they had to
[36:06] keep the candlesticks going they would
[36:08] go out so you had to keep it going
[36:10] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[36:12] out
[36:14] i want us to realize when we get into
[36:16] number two and number three that unclean
[36:18] spirit is we just got to keep it's got
[36:20] to be a daily i was reading back there
[36:22] because
[36:23] i i've got this
[36:25] my mind's on sticks and rods and
[36:28] and stuff like that we'll go back to
[36:29] sister shepard's dream what was coming
[36:31] out of the of the of the
[36:33] top box
[36:35] what was coming out
[36:37] sticks
[36:39] you've still got sticks
[36:41] rods you need to get rid of sticks we
[36:43] need to get rid of
[36:45] sticky
[36:46] things we need to get rid of
[36:48] amen
[36:50] the stick will stick you
[36:52] so i'll give you a new spirit now
[36:53] remember it's not god's spirit until you
[36:55] get to the holy of holies that's where
[36:56] you get
[36:57] god's spirit all right the baptism of
[36:59] holy ghost
[37:00] seeing you purified your souls and
[37:02] obeying the truth through the spirit of
[37:04] the unfaint love of the brethren
[37:05] see that you love one another with a
[37:07] pure heart fervently
[37:09] being born again not a corruptable seed
[37:11] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[37:14] which liveth and bite us
[37:16] forever but everybody's all right
[37:18] amen
[37:20] i'm going to drop this down a little bit
[37:22] make it where it won't be so
[37:24] where i can get it in
[37:30] hey move back over there
[37:33] technology is wonderful
[37:36] okay so now that you're not the tire
[37:38] here's the tabernacle so down here you
[37:40] go in we're going to see a picture of it
[37:41] a minute you've got your outer court the
[37:44] altar of sacrifice
[37:46] many many many thousands of sacrifices
[37:49] the bible tells us
[37:51] i believe it's the book of kings when
[37:53] when um
[37:54] you come up to uh solomon solomon's
[37:57] temple that they couldn't even count
[38:00] the sacrifices that were being made
[38:02] because they wanted to do one for this
[38:03] one and have one for this one untold
[38:05] thousands
[38:08] so that outer court was a mess
[38:11] and until you're born again you're a
[38:12] mess
[38:14] but at least you get inside them walls
[38:17] get inside get into that court
[38:21] get into that outer court where there is
[38:23] an altar of sacrifice which was made out
[38:25] of what brother louise brass
[38:28] signifies what judgment device judgment
[38:30] is going on then the lava where they
[38:33] wash off and then they walk into the
[38:35] holy place not the holy of holies
[38:38] because your next step of sanctification
[38:40] you're getting in line for god to give
[38:42] you the holy ghost so you've got to go
[38:45] through that but i want to read you a
[38:47] quote in just a little while but i want
[38:48] you to realize something
[38:50] aaron's rod had to go through that room
[38:53] but it never came to life
[38:55] until it got in that holy of holies
[38:58] the high priest carried that all them
[39:00] sticks you know moses got all them
[39:02] sticks he walked through every court
[39:05] not a one of them done anything
[39:07] but when he went in that holy of holies
[39:09] and laid him down
[39:10] the next day
[39:12] aaron's rod buddy
[39:14] it had to be in front of life before it
[39:16] could have life
[39:18] because listen we were all born dead
[39:20] sticks i'm getting to something here
[39:22] we're all born dead rods
[39:26] and without the holy ghost you're still
[39:28] a dead rod right
[39:32] jesus even became a dead rod
[39:34] we'll read it in just a minute
[39:36] amen
[39:38] so this is now is the most holy place
[39:40] ark of the covenant nothing in there but
[39:42] that ark
[39:43] but inside that ark there was three
[39:45] things
[39:46] she bred i mean not she bread sorry
[39:48] manna
[39:50] and then there was the ark the two
[39:51] tables of stone and then aaron's
[39:54] rod why was aaron's rod
[39:57] mixed in with all that
[39:59] why was there a rod
[40:01] because it had to be something tied with
[40:03] humanity
[40:05] and it had to be dead before it went in
[40:07] there i mean what in the world it would
[40:09] look really rough look up there in the
[40:11] corner you see that green tree that
[40:13] they've kind of got planted out there
[40:15] that'd be kind of rough to pick that
[40:17] tree up
[40:19] you've helped jacob so have i
[40:21] big old roots or something you just
[40:22] don't reach up and pull it out no you
[40:24] get you a big old backhoe or something
[40:26] and you get a forklift and when you pull
[40:29] that thing up a ball of roots comes out
[40:31] this big around now we're going to drag
[40:33] that through the through the holy hole
[40:35] into the holy holy no god requires one
[40:38] rod
[40:39] one person
[40:41] one you
[40:42] because he's gonna do something with you
[40:45] after he's gonna plant you
[40:49] according to psalms one by a river of
[40:51] living water
[40:53] amen
[40:54] praise the lord
[40:56] well i was yeah i had a good one
[41:02] but there's the outer court
[41:05] i like the way they got this little
[41:06] bless his little heart they got a little
[41:08] lamb laying right here a little
[41:10] little figurine laying on the table
[41:12] but that's what it was but it wasn't
[41:14] that pretty i promise you
[41:16] there was red flowing everywhere there
[41:18] was guts flowing everywhere and in your
[41:20] justification you are a mess
[41:24] and listen even when you're born again
[41:26] and come back out
[41:28] when you go through that second second
[41:30] stage of justification you got to go
[41:32] through that same process again
[41:35] because sister shepard was going through
[41:36] that same process again
[41:39] and that right she was already born
[41:41] again brother brown been born again she
[41:42] was standing in pure water brother brown
[41:44] said but
[41:46] but
[41:46] coming out of that pyramid
[41:49] or her
[41:52] life
[41:53] with sticks and trash
[41:55] we still got sticks and trash
[41:57] we're gonna be sticky the prophet of god
[41:59] said until we're finished with this
[42:00] thing
[42:02] but praise god he made provisions that
[42:04] we can get in there
[42:06] and that dead stick can come to life
[42:10] and be a miracle because it it was not
[42:13] planted in there it was just laying in
[42:15] there
[42:18] laying in sin and trespassed you were
[42:20] just laying there you were dead
[42:22] oh yeah you had a cigarette and a beer
[42:23] and you were partying you were alive no
[42:26] you were dead as that dead stick was
[42:28] before it went into that art
[42:32] but you still had to go through that
[42:34] outer court
[42:35] the inner court and holy of holies aaron
[42:38] had those sticks
[42:39] those rods
[42:41] he had to move them through there they
[42:43] no life
[42:44] no life
[42:45] but when he laid him before god
[42:48] when you lay yourself before god there
[42:50] will have to be life come
[42:54] it's got to be the right kind of rod too
[42:56] because there was 11 of them laying
[42:57] there that didn't get it
[43:01] one in a million
[43:04] okay
[43:06] so there's the ark there's the tables of
[43:09] two tables of stone with the message of
[43:11] the hour
[43:13] come on somebody with a message of the
[43:15] hour
[43:16] all right
[43:18] then there was the manna that they eat
[43:21] every day
[43:22] that was their sustaining portion now
[43:24] listen now if you were outside the court
[43:27] and you left it over
[43:29] to the next revival the brother branham
[43:31] said or to the next camp meeting come on
[43:33] somebody or to the next camp meeting it
[43:36] gets wiggle tails
[43:38] but when you take this manna right here
[43:41] they ate it every year it just stayed in
[43:43] the ark
[43:44] they'd reach down and get one of them
[43:46] and that was some if you read tradition
[43:48] tradition says that's some of the
[43:49] original manna that fell in the
[43:51] wilderness way back when it first
[43:52] started falling if you'll read your
[43:54] bible god tells moses gather up a
[43:57] basketful
[43:59] and put it in the holy of holies and
[44:01] he'll never have wiggle tails
[44:09] i've never read a passage of scripture
[44:11] or a quote that had wiggletails in it
[44:13] amen
[44:15] i've had i've read in the passage where
[44:16] i had some wiggle tails
[44:18] but not where god had any wiggle tails
[44:20] he takes the wiggle tails out when he
[44:22] puts it in the holy of holies
[44:28] you know i was thinking today
[44:31] i preached my the first sermon i
[44:32] preached
[44:33] in
[44:34] 1990 i believe it was in november
[44:38] i took a parallel between
[44:41] um
[44:42] moses
[44:44] jesus
[44:46] paul
[44:47] and brother branham if i don't know if
[44:49] you remember or not
[44:50] i think brother dick's already still got
[44:52] the or he doesn't but she sister gail
[44:54] may still have the video of it
[44:56] it was back then it was a vcr
[45:00] some of you who don't know what that is
[45:01] it's a
[45:02] big piece of equipment with a big old
[45:03] thing about that big you slide it in
[45:06] and it tapes like this
[45:08] but anyway i was thinking today i missed
[45:10] the point
[45:13] because here's three correlations with
[45:14] moses paul and brother branham that
[45:16] maybe
[45:17] i mean moses paul moses moses brother
[45:20] jesus moses jesus paul and brother
[45:22] branham
[45:23] moses was connected to a tent
[45:27] jesus was the tent
[45:29] the prophet of god tells us that he
[45:30] stretched his tent
[45:32] over the people
[45:34] paul was a tent maker
[45:39] and brother branham had a dream
[45:42] about a tent
[45:44] a three-room situation
[45:46] just as we're talking about and that's
[45:49] that's what i believe i mean you believe
[45:50] what you want to about the tent
[45:51] i don't think it's a physical tent
[45:53] because the physical tent has never
[45:54] saved anybody
[45:56] a physical putting up a tent no has not
[45:58] saved anybody it's going in that holy of
[46:01] holies yourself
[46:03] in that little room along with god and
[46:06] listen your healing is going to be your
[46:07] salvation
[46:09] not just the healing of your of your
[46:11] infirmities yes god will work that out
[46:13] but you got to be born again
[46:17] amen
[46:19] so they were all connected with the tent
[46:22] so there must be something about a tent
[46:24] because that's what you are
[46:25] you're a tabernacle during the feast of
[46:27] tabernacles what do they do
[46:30] they build a tent or they build a
[46:32] shelter out of what
[46:35] wood
[46:38] wood sticks
[46:40] and you sit in that booth
[46:44] you and god
[46:46] alone
[46:47] in your
[46:48] tabernacle
[46:50] are your little tent
[46:53] now notice these holy places
[47:00] now when you come into the courts the
[47:01] first was the court the outer court
[47:03] next was the altar where the sacrifice
[47:05] was offered to brazen altar then outside
[47:07] of the brazen altar there was a veil
[47:09] hung over where it went to the holy of
[47:10] holies and there was the mercy seat and
[47:13] there were the cherubs that's what i
[47:15] want to get to in our next lesson let's
[47:16] continue on to them now now notice
[47:18] as they entered in the congregation
[47:20] could come there congregation could come
[47:23] there the priest could stand here but
[47:25] just the high priest could go in there
[47:27] now he's talking about out of court in a
[47:28] court holy of holies everybody with me
[47:30] he's either pointing to something or
[47:32] showing something because the priest
[47:34] stands here many priests stand here
[47:37] lest priest stand in here
[47:40] because look sanctification is not for
[47:42] everybody
[47:43] especially when you get up to the higher
[47:45] form of sanctification
[47:49] amen
[47:51] then when you get in a holy of holies
[47:52] listen there's only a certain amount of
[47:54] people that's born again
[47:57] listen the prophet of god said eight was
[47:59] saved by water
[48:01] that didn't type the new birth
[48:06] right that type the souls that made it
[48:08] up the foods version that made it
[48:10] through that went over what over
[48:13] right
[48:15] he said there was one
[48:17] one enoch
[48:19] god took his tent and took it into
[48:20] another dimension
[48:22] that's us one in a million
[48:26] and he had to be dressed a certain way
[48:28] a certain garment had to have a bell and
[48:30] a pomegranate one to another when he
[48:31] walked
[48:32] he had to walk a certain way praise god
[48:35] as he walked he played holy holy unto
[48:37] the lord holy holy unto the lord those
[48:39] bells and pomegranates ringing together
[48:41] holy holy why he was approaching god
[48:45] having the blood of the covenant in his
[48:47] hand
[48:49] what could you imagine
[48:51] if that blood
[48:53] you don't spill it
[48:55] it's got to be taken it with the fingers
[48:57] sprinkled seven times on that altar
[49:01] and then
[49:04] that's when israel sins man you can't be
[49:06] doing this
[49:09] you know why if you're doing this
[49:10] because your life's not right back there
[49:13] come on somebody your life's not right
[49:15] back here if you're doing this up here
[49:22] anointed with certain perfumes
[49:24] his clothes had to be made by holy ghost
[49:26] filled hands registered hands makes his
[49:29] clothes
[49:30] so clothes must have something to do
[49:32] with it
[49:33] the rose of sharon the anointing all
[49:34] poured it on his head and it ran all
[49:36] down his beard and then down over in
[49:38] other words over his whole body he was
[49:40] placing the royal perfume a pomegranate
[49:42] a bell take the blood of an innocent
[49:44] lamb and he look he dares approaching
[49:46] that veil outside he'd die right where
[49:49] he was standing
[49:50] so he had to go walking a certain way
[49:52] and when he went there and offered the
[49:54] blood on the mercy seat once a year
[49:57] and while he was in there he was
[49:58] privileged to see this you kind of glory
[50:01] when the pillar of fire the amber light
[50:04] that came down that led to children of
[50:05] israel
[50:06] he even smoked up the temple so no one
[50:09] could see it the glory of the lord fell
[50:11] till it was all smoked up
[50:13] and he came in himself and went in
[50:14] behind the veil and settled down like i
[50:16] said before there was nothing going on
[50:18] and all of a sudden
[50:22] brother branham he he told us how that
[50:24] came
[50:25] remember he said
[50:26] two times two is four two times two four
[50:29] two times two's fourth he said it comes
[50:30] and accelerates
[50:32] he said when he comes there he is you're
[50:33] in the presence well that's god can't do
[50:35] it any other way he had to be doing it
[50:37] the same way inside there
[50:40] but you have to be addressed a certain
[50:42] way walk a certain way anointed a
[50:43] certain way he was a special person to
[50:46] go in there how the congregation must
[50:48] have envied him you don't have to envy
[50:51] that today
[50:53] you can go back there with yourself by
[50:56] yourself
[50:57] listen if you don't make it do not blame
[50:59] the preacher
[51:01] amen
[51:03] amen
[51:05] i'll amend that too blame yourself
[51:10] when jesus died the temple veil was rent
[51:13] not only a high priest but whosoever
[51:14] will can now have that same anointing
[51:17] of the shekinah glory and walk a holy
[51:19] life holy holy unto the lord
[51:21] and approaching the very presence of god
[51:23] look what through the blood of jesus
[51:25] christ which is now grace not judgment
[51:30] take him lord jesus he lays a sick man
[51:31] he's my brother he's on deathbed right
[51:33] now to die i'm approaching you holy holy
[51:36] unto the lord what for as a high priest
[51:38] what for on behalf of my brother holy
[51:40] holy holy and to the lord there you are
[51:43] your daily walk
[51:45] your daily talk
[51:47] your daily
[51:48] behavior not at ten and two and seven
[51:53] sounds like a dr pepper commercial
[51:56] ten two and six
[51:58] but at ten two and seven it's not just
[52:00] what that is it's 24
[52:03] as 7.
[52:03] song says 24 7 365 days a year
[52:09] we still have our ups and downs folks
[52:11] but
[52:12] we got to start this this
[52:14] god told us we got to do this and he
[52:15] made a way to do it
[52:17] holy holy one to the lord look no roots
[52:19] of bitterness
[52:21] no nothing else holy holy hole into the
[52:23] lord holy holy holy unto the lord as we
[52:25] begin to approach on behalf of our
[52:27] brother whosoever will may come anointed
[52:30] blood in front of him the blood going
[52:32] before him playing holy holy unto the
[52:34] lord now that was the outer course the
[52:36] holy place and the holy of holy that was
[52:38] god's sanctuary where on earth
[52:42] now remember we told you it was mobile
[52:44] because it didn't stay in one place it
[52:45] wasn't a statue it was a stature and
[52:48] that stature would move
[52:50] that place they would take it apart they
[52:52] would pull those staves out when it was
[52:54] there and they would put those staves in
[52:56] turn around and they would walk that
[52:58] holy of holies out
[53:01] the priest did it
[53:03] not just the congregation
[53:05] but now that's not right now
[53:08] come boldly to the throne of grace
[53:10] come bowling to the ark of the
[53:13] right now this is where we were talking
[53:15] about last sunday talk brother louise
[53:16] was talking about bearing fruit
[53:18] well now that's what we're getting ready
[53:20] to talk about we're going to talk red
[53:21] talk about bear fruits of the spirit
[53:23] love joy peace long suffering and we're
[53:25] going to call them
[53:26] almonds okay
[53:28] we're gonna call almonds
[53:30] we're gonna talk about ver almond virtue
[53:33] almond knowledge
[53:35] cause that's the fruit that that that
[53:36] tree why was it an almond tree we'll get
[53:38] to that later on
[53:40] why wasn't a willow why wasn't an oak
[53:44] we'll not get to it tonight but we may
[53:47] get to a little bit later just keep
[53:48] digging deep you'll find something
[53:52] but look
[53:55] let's read number 17 and the lord's
[53:56] speaking to moses we know what this is
[53:58] and
[53:59] i was reading where brother branham
[54:01] was talking about it he said god was
[54:02] separating his people out
[54:04] and that's pretty much what's happening
[54:06] because nathan and cora is walking up to
[54:08] moses saying hey
[54:11] they looking up to you a little bit too
[54:12] much they need to be over here going to
[54:14] my church
[54:19] 200 of them i believe it's 250 actually
[54:25] and we know what happened to him so
[54:26] we're not getting into that
[54:28] because listen god has a provided way he
[54:30] is that provided person brother branham
[54:32] was the person we have to listen to to
[54:34] get the revelation to deliver by fifo
[54:37] ministry to the people
[54:40] not filtered from your own ideas
[54:43] william branham than you and then some
[54:45] you understand what i'm saying
[54:46] speaking of the children of israel but
[54:48] remember brother brown said he preached
[54:50] god's provided way of worship there is a
[54:52] provided way and we've got to go that
[54:53] way
[54:55] because we're human beings
[54:57] we're humanity
[54:59] speaking of the children of israel take
[55:00] one of them every one of them a rod
[55:02] according to the house of their father
[55:03] of all their princes according to the
[55:05] house of the father 12 rods we know
[55:06] that's for the 12 tribes now remember
[55:08] where was aaron from he was from the
[55:10] tribe of levi
[55:12] everybody with me
[55:13] so aaron's was
[55:15] the tribe of levi when the stick came up
[55:17] that was aaron's rod and he wrote his
[55:19] name on it
[55:21] right or
[55:22] moses did
[55:23] all right
[55:24] and thou shalt lay them in the
[55:25] tabernacle of the congregation before
[55:27] the testimony that's called the
[55:28] testimony
[55:30] because that's a testimony that god was
[55:32] with those people he was with nobody
[55:34] else
[55:35] when that thing got stolen took to
[55:36] another country remember they put it in
[55:38] the in the temple with dagon and they'd
[55:40] walk in and they're gonna be smacked on
[55:42] the ground set him back up come back the
[55:44] next day dagon was smacked to the ground
[55:47] come back the next day and they said
[55:49] get that thing out of here
[55:51] that's kind of like a a christian or a
[55:56] sinner hanging around a christian
[55:58] finally if they don't become a christian
[56:00] they say get out of here leave me alone
[56:04] brother dick says i think i still got it
[56:06] in my pocket that their spirit
[56:08] irritates my spirit
[56:10] i love that i believe i'm gonna quote it
[56:11] again
[56:13] bless brother dick
[56:16] some people will never
[56:20] like you because your spirit irritates
[56:22] their demons
[56:26] praise the
[56:28] lord sometimes brother dick did irritate
[56:31] us a little bit every once in a while
[56:32] that's okay
[56:33] but it was my demons that it was
[56:34] irritated i guess so
[56:36] and it shall come to pass that the man's
[56:38] rod whom what whom i shall choose
[56:42] god shall choose not moses
[56:45] god shall choose shall blossom
[56:48] and i will make to cease from me the
[56:49] murmurings of the children of israel in
[56:51] other words he'd heard enough
[56:52] whereby they murmur against you
[56:56] see they were murmuring to moses but
[56:57] remember
[56:58] who was it that he said oh lord they're
[57:01] they're against me and he said i don't
[57:03] they're not against you they're against
[57:04] me
[57:05] all right
[57:07] and moses spake unto the children of
[57:08] israel and every one of their princes
[57:10] gave him a rod according to their
[57:12] father's house now remember they were
[57:14] dead sticks
[57:16] they had been cut off you know they had
[57:17] been cut
[57:18] dead sticks
[57:19] and aaron's rod was among their rods and
[57:22] moses laid up the rods before the lord
[57:23] in the tabernacle witness i don't
[57:25] believe it i don't believe moses turned
[57:27] around said oh i'm gonna put aaron's
[57:29] right over here next to them
[57:31] right up under the ark
[57:32] and i'm gonna put it's a car
[57:34] and ask her over here on this side no i
[57:37] believe he just laid him down
[57:40] because god's not that way he's not
[57:41] partial
[57:42] he gives everybody a chance
[57:45] but he knew
[57:46] and it came to pass on tomorrow moses
[57:48] went to the tabernacle and behold the
[57:49] rod of aaron for the house of levi was
[57:52] butted and brought forth buds and
[57:54] blossomed bloom blossoms and yielded
[57:56] almonds you know these are almonds
[57:59] these are not green baby almonds that it
[58:01] produced
[58:03] it produced edible almonds that day
[58:06] these were almonds that were ready to
[58:08] harvest
[58:11] what a mighty god we serve
[58:13] and moses brought out all the rods from
[58:15] before the lord and to all the children
[58:17] of israel and they looked and took every
[58:19] man his rod and the lord said unto moses
[58:22] bring aaron's rod again before the
[58:23] testimony to be kept
[58:25] for a token against the rebels and thou
[58:28] shalt quite take away their murmuring
[58:30] from me that they die not
[58:33] so there's the rod
[58:35] but let's go to psalms 23.
[58:39] psalms 23 he restoreth my soul
[58:42] he leadeth me in the past of
[58:43] righteousness for his name's sake
[58:45] yet though i walk through the valley of
[58:46] the shadow of death i will fill for no
[58:48] evil for what for thou art with me
[58:51] thy rod and thy staff
[58:53] they comfort me
[58:55] now rod is giving forth my staff
[58:58] they comfort me
[59:00] now rod is given for authority
[59:04] all right sepulcher or separator not
[59:07] sepulcher like a death place for death
[59:08] but a septum scepter
[59:10] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[59:12] not kill me
[59:14] they comfort me
[59:17] psalms 89 if they break my statutes and
[59:19] keep not count my commandments then will
[59:21] i visit their transgression with a rod
[59:25] what with the word with jesus christ
[59:28] think of the rod as christ that's christ
[59:30] that was in there that's his humanity
[59:32] we're going to see a few minutes from
[59:34] now that he was cut off
[59:37] from the land of the living he came a
[59:39] dead stick
[59:44] and he died a dead stick
[59:47] but all on resurrection morning
[59:50] what an almond
[59:53] then i will visit their transgression
[59:55] with a rod
[59:56] and their iniquity
[59:58] with stripes proverbs 13 verse 24 he
[1:00:01] that spareth his rod hateth his son but
[1:00:04] he that loveth him chasing him many
[1:00:06] times
[1:00:08] foolishness is bound in the heart of a
[1:00:09] child but what the rod of correction he
[1:00:11] is not talking about an old-fashioned
[1:00:14] hickory switch
[1:00:17] if not then
[1:00:18] uh all the other times that that we got
[1:00:20] whipped with
[1:00:22] um hairbrushes and knives and
[1:00:25] belts and everything else wasn't
[1:00:26] scriptural
[1:00:28] you had to go get rod that's not what
[1:00:30] he's talking about
[1:00:31] the rod of correction what the your
[1:00:34] humanity
[1:00:35] that has blossomed
[1:00:38] how do you correct your children how's
[1:00:39] the best way to correct your children
[1:00:41] live the life in front of them
[1:00:44] live the life in front of them yeah we
[1:00:46] got to holler at them and scream at them
[1:00:47] and try to smack them every once in a
[1:00:49] while
[1:00:51] but what is better
[1:00:53] god smack you like that all the time
[1:00:56] no he gives you a rod of correction what
[1:00:59] does he do he gives you this right here
[1:01:02] and you have to take this and put it in
[1:01:03] your humanity and if you will i promise
[1:01:06] you this has got life in it
[1:01:08] it will bring your old dead stick to
[1:01:10] life
[1:01:12] don't have to be planted but what's
[1:01:14] going to happen after he makes your dead
[1:01:15] stick cup to come to life we're going to
[1:01:17] read it in just a minute he's going to
[1:01:19] plant you
[1:01:22] everybody with me
[1:01:23] genesis 2 9 and out of the ground may
[1:01:25] the lord god now look we're going all
[1:01:26] the way back to genesis
[1:01:28] and remember the prophet of god told us
[1:01:30] in genesis 2 7 i didn't bring it but you
[1:01:33] ought to know that when when god that
[1:01:35] genesis 1 26 man when he put it in into
[1:01:38] adam the 2-7 man what did he say
[1:01:42] come on
[1:01:44] he said it looked like his toes were
[1:01:46] roots
[1:01:48] and he was a tree
[1:01:51] planted
[1:01:52] in the garden of eden
[1:01:54] but he was in his humanity so he could
[1:01:56] walk around symbolism he was he came out
[1:01:59] of the ground he was what he was
[1:02:00] attached or connected to the ground
[1:02:04] everybody with me
[1:02:05] he was connected to the ground but watch
[1:02:07] this
[1:02:08] and out of the ground may god the lord
[1:02:10] god to grow every tree what that was it
[1:02:11] was they were attached
[1:02:13] they were attached to the earth
[1:02:16] but somewhere that's got to be pulled up
[1:02:20] because we didn't come the way we were
[1:02:21] supposed to come we were supposed to
[1:02:23] come to tree of life
[1:02:29] look
[1:02:31] the tree of life also in the midst of
[1:02:32] the garden who did brother brown say
[1:02:34] that was jesus christ
[1:02:37] the branch the rod
[1:02:41] but what happened
[1:02:42] we turned that down
[1:02:44] and we came off the tree of knowledge of
[1:02:46] good and evil amen
[1:02:49] which was also stuck in the ground
[1:02:52] satan is stuck in your ground
[1:02:54] until you get him out
[1:02:56] isaiah 11 1.
[1:02:58] i love this because what a what a
[1:03:00] uh what a promise
[1:03:03] and there shall come forth a what a rod
[1:03:06] out of the stem of jesse in other words
[1:03:08] jesse's lineage if you'll understand
[1:03:10] what i'm saying it was mail it was
[1:03:12] coming out of him it was coming forth it
[1:03:14] was issued up from jesse do you know who
[1:03:16] jesse was
[1:03:19] who was jesse
[1:03:21] jesse was the son
[1:03:23] of ruth and boaz
[1:03:29] david's grandparents
[1:03:32] but he's not talking about david here
[1:03:35] he's talking about jesus christ
[1:03:37] so there shall come forth a rod out of
[1:03:40] the stem of jesse and a branch shall
[1:03:41] what grow out of his roots so in other
[1:03:44] words he's got to come to earth and
[1:03:45] plant himself in the ground
[1:03:48] listen jesus christ didn't come from
[1:03:50] this earth
[1:03:55] he came from his own
[1:03:56] earth so he was cut off
[1:03:59] from your earth
[1:04:01] come on somebody
[1:04:04] and the spirit of the lord
[1:04:06] shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom
[1:04:07] and understanding you say oh that's
[1:04:09] jesus that's you
[1:04:12] we know he did all this we know we came
[1:04:14] to all this we know he's the rose of
[1:04:16] sharing the lily of the valley but i
[1:04:18] thought we were heirs enjoying ours with
[1:04:20] this guy
[1:04:21] i thought whatever stick he got we got
[1:04:23] whatever rod he got we got whatever
[1:04:25] fruit he got we got amen
[1:04:29] one day y'all might get happy
[1:04:33] and the spirit of counsel look the
[1:04:35] spirit of counsel and might the spirit
[1:04:37] of knowledge and of the fear of the lord
[1:04:39] to me that's the statue of a perfect man
[1:04:41] and shall make him what quick
[1:04:43] understanding
[1:04:44] and the fear of the lord
[1:04:47] some of us don't fit that
[1:04:50] me either the quick understanding and
[1:04:52] he's look he shall not judge after the
[1:04:54] side of his eyes
[1:04:58] woman
[1:04:59] where are your accusers
[1:05:04] because if you're going back in this
[1:05:06] story just a little while we didn't go
[1:05:08] back far enough we went to boaz and ruth
[1:05:10] are you going back a little bit further
[1:05:11] a generation before that there was a
[1:05:13] involved
[1:05:18] rahab
[1:05:20] yeah hmm so you didn't see through these
[1:05:23] eyes did we
[1:05:25] but we see through god's eyes
[1:05:27] the spirit of knowledge and the fear of
[1:05:28] the lord it shall make him a quick
[1:05:30] understanding in the fear of the lord
[1:05:31] and he shall not judge after the sight
[1:05:33] of his eyes neither reprove after the
[1:05:36] hearing of his ears but with
[1:05:37] righteousness
[1:05:40] he shall judge the poor and repu reprove
[1:05:43] the equity for the meek of the earth and
[1:05:45] look he shall smite the earth with the
[1:05:48] rod of his mouth
[1:05:50] the word of god listen the word of god
[1:05:53] was put in there by god himself but he
[1:05:55] put a rod in there he put a rod in there
[1:05:58] with the word in it right
[1:06:01] what made that rod blood
[1:06:04] the word that was in there made that rod
[1:06:07] the word that was in there made that rod
[1:06:09] bud
[1:06:10] the word that was in you makes you a rod
[1:06:12] blood
[1:06:14] he shall my look the saints will judge
[1:06:17] the earth
[1:06:19] listen if you don't get anything from
[1:06:20] this sermon that ride was you
[1:06:24] surely it was jesus christ but he was
[1:06:26] cut off
[1:06:33] he was cut off
[1:06:36] so he could die
[1:06:39] believe that let's read
[1:06:41] isaiah 53 this is
[1:06:44] my fist don't stir you
[1:06:46] stir you
[1:06:50] just don't stir yet who has believed i
[1:06:51] report
[1:06:52] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:06:53] reveal for he shall grow up now wait a
[1:06:55] minute grow up means he was planted
[1:06:57] somewhere this tree didn't grow up at
[1:06:59] first
[1:07:00] it was growing
[1:07:02] everybody with me it was growing
[1:07:04] but it got cut off
[1:07:07] that means it died
[1:07:10] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:07:12] tender plant and has a root out of dry
[1:07:14] ground in other words he had to come
[1:07:15] down here come through the womb of a
[1:07:18] woman and be planted on this earth
[1:07:22] because that's the way you came
[1:07:24] you were planted here by your mom and
[1:07:25] your daddy
[1:07:27] everybody with me
[1:07:29] so he had to be planted the rod out of
[1:07:31] the stem of jesse
[1:07:33] humanity genealogy he had to come that
[1:07:35] way through a male not through joseph
[1:07:39] through god
[1:07:40] who was a male
[1:07:43] anybody with me remember brother brown
[1:07:44] said he said he said if you're born of a
[1:07:46] woman you'll die he says if you're born
[1:07:47] a man you'll live
[1:07:50] come on somebody if you're born of a
[1:07:51] woman you'll die
[1:07:54] if you're born of a man you'll live
[1:07:56] and he shall grow up before him as a
[1:07:58] what a tender plant as a root out of dry
[1:08:00] ground
[1:08:01] he had no form of commonness he probably
[1:08:03] wasn't the prettiest rod or stickers
[1:08:07] tree
[1:08:08] in nazareth
[1:08:09] any good thing come out of nazareth
[1:08:13] that looks kind of crooked
[1:08:15] i don't see anything i like about that
[1:08:19] when we shall see him there's no beauty
[1:08:22] that we should desire him
[1:08:26] the most beautiful thing that man ever
[1:08:28] done
[1:08:29] is not make a nice picture of himself
[1:08:32] it was he died
[1:08:34] the most horrible death
[1:08:36] anybody ever died
[1:08:37] that's the most beautiful thing
[1:08:39] that ever happened
[1:08:41] on the face of the earth
[1:08:43] and it happened on the earth
[1:08:45] because he was planted in the earth but
[1:08:47] he had to be plucked out
[1:08:49] listen i'll show you right here
[1:08:51] as a root out of dry ground he shall he
[1:08:53] has no form or commonness when we shall
[1:08:55] see him there's no beauty that we should
[1:08:57] desire
[1:08:58] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:09:01] listen we we love the heirs and join
[1:09:03] ourselves
[1:09:06] that's you too
[1:09:08] you got to bear this
[1:09:10] you'll be despised and rejected of men
[1:09:14] you'll be a man of sorrow acquainted
[1:09:16] with grief
[1:09:18] and we hit it as it wears our faces from
[1:09:19] and he was despised and we esteemed him
[1:09:22] not
[1:09:23] surely he has borne our grief
[1:09:26] he became an ugly stick so you could be
[1:09:28] a pretty one
[1:09:31] you sit there look at me all you want to
[1:09:33] but there's still to be something
[1:09:34] stirring in your soul
[1:09:38] so this is you guys
[1:09:40] i know we're talking about jesus christ
[1:09:42] you know what this is talking about but
[1:09:43] that's you
[1:09:45] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:09:47] of god
[1:09:49] i'm sure
[1:09:50] the high priest stood there and said
[1:09:52] he's being
[1:09:54] he's being
[1:09:55] um
[1:09:56] tormented by god
[1:09:58] for the way he is
[1:10:00] because we have god is our father
[1:10:03] who is this guy
[1:10:05] all just they didn't know
[1:10:07] that he was that rod
[1:10:09] that came out of the stem of jesse
[1:10:11] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:10:14] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:10:16] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:10:18] with his stripes
[1:10:20] we are healed
[1:10:22] all we are like sheep have gone astray
[1:10:26] we in that outer court just running
[1:10:27] everywhere
[1:10:29] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:10:32] boy in that laodicea
[1:10:34] my way or the highway
[1:10:36] and the lord hath laid on him the
[1:10:38] iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[1:10:41] this depresses me to say this he was
[1:10:43] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[1:10:46] not his mouth bless god i'll get him no
[1:10:49] he knew his word would
[1:10:54] and if that rod of judgment
[1:10:56] it's not jesus christ it's you
[1:10:59] the saints will what
[1:11:02] judge the earth
[1:11:04] by what by the rod
[1:11:06] of correction
[1:11:07] that rod you are
[1:11:10] that's why brother louise i couldn't get
[1:11:12] away from this rod man i just could not
[1:11:14] get away from it because it's you it's
[1:11:16] not just a dead stick that was laying an
[1:11:18] ark
[1:11:20] he was taken from prison and from
[1:11:21] judgment look and who showed it i
[1:11:23] preached on this many times who shall
[1:11:25] declare his generation with a tree

[1:11:38] this man who shall declare his
[1:11:40] generation for he was cut off
[1:11:44] he was made a dead stick
[1:11:47] he was made a dead rod
[1:11:50] but all when it got put in
[1:11:54] the ground
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:57] on easter morning
[1:11:59] what a resurrection that was
[1:12:02] but what a resurrection this is almonds
[1:12:05] were blooming
[1:12:06] almonds were being born the fruit of the
[1:12:08] spirit walked out and said all heaven
[1:12:10] and earth
[1:12:11] all power's been given unto me i'm not a
[1:12:14] dead stick anymore
[1:12:16] i'm alive and i'm here to plant these
[1:12:19] people back in the ground because
[1:12:21] everybody has come through a woman has
[1:12:25] died
[1:12:31] folks my blood pressure was 145 over
[1:12:33] almost 90 a little while ago but i'm

[1:12:51] i couldn't get back to you so you came
[1:12:53] cut off
[1:12:54] you came smitten afflicted whacked off
[1:12:58] despised
[1:13:00] hey listen come on
[1:13:03] we love beautiful branches and trees and
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:09] we love
[1:13:10] well i don't like crap crape myrtle i
[1:13:12] don't like them at all never mind
[1:13:14] let's put roses
[1:13:16] roses are good crape myrtles are
[1:13:17] horrible
[1:13:19] thank you sister
[1:13:21] they poop everywhere
[1:13:23] but anyway but it's the plan of god okay
[1:13:25] so it's okay
[1:13:26] but you see now walk to a garden
[1:13:30] it's all live stuff right
[1:13:32] all beautiful
[1:13:35] but when you went to god's garden
[1:13:39] that morning
[1:13:40] before the resurrection
[1:13:43] everything was
[1:13:44] dead there was just stick sticking up
[1:13:51] but that was the most beautiful thing
[1:13:52] because he was getting to resurrect
[1:13:54] coming to resurrect and he was going to
[1:13:56] resurrect you and me
[1:13:58] take you out of the earth you were
[1:14:00] planted in the earth that you had
[1:14:02] nothing to do with
[1:14:05] but you had to come that way you had to
[1:14:08] come plant it into the ground
[1:14:12] but
[1:14:13] planting got in the ground though when
[1:14:15] you come to the age of accountability
[1:14:18] you got cut off
[1:14:22] you got cut off from god
[1:14:24] you became that dry stick that dry rod
[1:14:28] and there's no way you can get that back
[1:14:30] listen if you take one and cut it off
[1:14:32] and graft it it's got to be alive
[1:14:36] but you can't take a dead stick and
[1:14:38] graft it to a live tree
[1:14:41] won't grow because what there's no life
[1:14:45] you had no life that's right brother
[1:14:49] you are a dead stick
[1:14:51] sticking up in humanity
[1:14:56] he was cut off
[1:14:58] out of the land of living
[1:15:01] he came here planted
[1:15:03] you know what happened
[1:15:05] man cut him off
[1:15:07] man
[1:15:09] cut him off
[1:15:10] the greatest religious people in the
[1:15:11] world cut him off
[1:15:14] they hewed him down
[1:15:16] they put him on a tree
[1:15:18] and said we'll get rid of this guy
[1:15:20] oh he's dead now
[1:15:22] let's make sure let's roll that big
[1:15:24] stone they could have put stone mountain
[1:15:26] and all the rocky mountains together on
[1:15:29] top of that grave and that would not
[1:15:31] have held that man
[1:15:33] because he had life
[1:15:36] for the transgression of my people
[1:15:39] was he stricken
[1:15:41] he was cut down for me and you because
[1:15:42] he knew you were cut down
[1:15:47] and if you're his
[1:15:49] you're gonna have to be planted
[1:15:53] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:15:54] with the rich in his death
[1:15:56] because he hath done no violence neither
[1:15:58] was any deceit in his mouth what a man
[1:16:00] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:16:03] why because he could see his seed
[1:16:06] you
[1:16:09] when thou shalt make his soul
[1:16:11] an offering for sin
[1:16:14] he shall see a seed
[1:16:16] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:16:18] pleasure of the lord shall prosper he
[1:16:21] must have planted this somewhere
[1:16:24] a dead stick does not prosper
[1:16:26] what i do with that stick now put it
[1:16:28] back
[1:16:29] all right we'll leave him in there
[1:16:31] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:16:33] pleasure of the lord shall prosper in
[1:16:35] his hand look he shall see the travail
[1:16:37] of his soul
[1:16:38] what that's where the life of the plan
[1:16:40] is it's in the soul
[1:16:43] he shall see the travail of his soul
[1:16:46] and shall be satisfied this is good
[1:16:50] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:16:51] servant justify
[1:16:54] wake dale
[1:16:57] for he shall bear away dale's iniquity
[1:17:01] because i was born a dead stick
[1:17:03] a dead rod
[1:17:05] no way back couldn't bring forth fruit
[1:17:07] you can't get fruit i never did right
[1:17:09] branch
[1:17:11] john 12 23 now watch him prove what he's
[1:17:14] going to do and jesus answered and said
[1:17:17] the hours come that the son of man
[1:17:20] this is the hour that the son of man is
[1:17:22] to be glorified
[1:17:24] fairly fairly i say unto you except a
[1:17:26] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[1:17:28] die
[1:17:30] it abideth alone but if if it die
[1:17:35] can't do that naturally
[1:17:38] it's got to have some life in it
[1:17:42] it bringeth forth
[1:17:44] much fruit
[1:17:46] on the day of pentecost
[1:17:47] was 120 little almonds
[1:17:50] then 3 000 little almonds came budding
[1:17:54] god started planting them because what
[1:17:56] this is the promise of god folks
[1:17:58] blessed is a man that walketh not the
[1:18:00] council of the ungodly nor standing in
[1:18:02] the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[1:18:03] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[1:18:05] in the law of the lord and in his law
[1:18:07] doth he meditate day and night and he
[1:18:09] shall be like a tree planted
[1:18:13] planted
[1:18:15] to bring forth life
[1:18:17] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:18:19] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:18:22] you and i are bringing forth fruit in
[1:18:25] this season
[1:18:28] a measure of faith
[1:18:31] faith for the time this offense together
[1:18:36] and bringing forth his fruit and deceit
[1:18:38] his leave shall also not wither
[1:18:41] and whatsoever he doeth
[1:18:43] shall prosper
[1:18:45] the ungodly are not so
[1:18:47] but they are like chaff what is chaff
[1:18:50] jeff is something that's been cut down
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] they're coming to a time where they're
[1:18:56] going to be harvested
[1:19:01] which the wind
[1:19:04] the wind of doctrine
[1:19:07] driveth away
[1:19:09] matthew 15 verse 13 says but he answered
[1:19:11] and said every plant
[1:19:13] which my heavenly father hath not
[1:19:15] planted
[1:19:17] shall be rooted up
[1:19:20] romans 6 4
[1:19:22] therefore we are buried with him in
[1:19:23] baptism we read this in the baptism
[1:19:26] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:19:28] the dead by the glory of the father even
[1:19:30] so we also should walk in newness of
[1:19:32] life for if we have been what planted
[1:19:35] together
[1:19:36] in the likeness of his death we all show
[1:19:38] we shall be also
[1:19:40] in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:46] a dead stink did not walk out of that
[1:19:48] grave he was fixing to bear almonds 11
[1:19:52] days later he started bearing almonds
[1:19:55] peter stood up on the day of pentecost
[1:19:57] and said have you took of this tree yet
[1:20:00] have you eaten these almonds that we got
[1:20:03] have you protected this holy ghost
[1:20:08] esau shall be in the likeness of his
[1:20:10] resurrection
[1:20:12] knowing this that our old man is
[1:20:13] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:20:15] might be destroyed and henceforth we
[1:20:17] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[1:20:20] is free from sin let's read a few quotes
[1:20:22] if you don't mind just for a minute
[1:20:24] 1955 a hidden life you ought to read
[1:20:26] this or listen to this message
[1:20:28] in this same place we don't have much
[1:20:30] time because they got a hurry but just
[1:20:32] for another thought in this same place
[1:20:34] they put aaron's rod to make a decision
[1:20:37] who god had chosen and who he hadn't
[1:20:40] are you with me
[1:20:42] and that rod that was a dead stick
[1:20:45] in one night's time at an altar
[1:20:48] somewhere in lula georgia
[1:20:50] or anywhere you come from there was a
[1:20:52] decision made
[1:20:54] and one night's time came to life
[1:20:57] brought buds brought flowers brought
[1:20:59] almonds
[1:21:01] if both come to life bro blossoms yield
[1:21:04] fruit
[1:21:05] a very typical pattern of the sinner
[1:21:08] being brought to god into the holy place
[1:21:12] remember that rod watch this this is
[1:21:14] where i got this from
[1:21:16] remember that rod passed over every one
[1:21:19] of those other elements
[1:21:22] right
[1:21:23] the the laver
[1:21:25] the the brazen altar aaron had to carry
[1:21:27] it right by them it goes into the into
[1:21:30] the holy place and there's some pretty
[1:21:32] good stuff in their sanctification you
[1:21:33] know getting clean set aside for service
[1:21:35] you got the candlesticks you got the
[1:21:37] shoe bread you've got the altar of
[1:21:38] incense didn't bloom a
[1:21:41] had to thing
[1:21:41] in the right place
[1:21:43] i had to get to the holy holy see that's
[1:21:44] the problem that's the problem with
[1:21:48] the foolish virgin
[1:21:50] they stop at this court
[1:21:52] they got their rod
[1:21:53] but it's dead
[1:21:55] because remember without the holy ghost
[1:21:56] you're dead so they didn't get the holy
[1:21:58] ghost they got in a position
[1:22:00] but they didn't go all the way in if
[1:22:02] they went all the way in their rod would
[1:22:03] have started budding
[1:22:05] everybody with me on this
[1:22:07] it never came to life
[1:22:10] when that rod passed every one of those
[1:22:12] other elements that got inside the holy
[1:22:14] place still dead
[1:22:16] remember the holy place is the second
[1:22:17] not the not the holy of holies the
[1:22:19] second one all right
[1:22:21] sanctification
[1:22:22] good place to be bad place to what stay
[1:22:27] it never came to life when they first
[1:22:29] brought it in there that's the reason
[1:22:31] the holy spirit watched you since you
[1:22:34] received the holy ghost
[1:22:36] see your attitude toward his kingdom
[1:22:39] wow
[1:22:41] if it's been selfish motive if the
[1:22:43] things that you've thought of has been
[1:22:45] in furthering a denomination
[1:22:49] boy
[1:22:51] or if it's doing farther better you your
[1:22:53] position if it's to make you a man
[1:22:56] that i me me i prayed for that person
[1:22:59] and they i pray
[1:23:02] i thought god get the glory
[1:23:05] if it well i'm just reading brother
[1:23:06] brown said if you want to better your
[1:23:08] position better you if it's to make you
[1:23:11] a man looked up to in the world if it's
[1:23:14] to build you a big church somewhere bob
[1:23:16] build your kingdom
[1:23:20] there's a story behind that
[1:23:22] bob sent us up with you that sent us
[1:23:24] where that preacher was
[1:23:26] the denominational preacher he was boy
[1:23:27] he was letting people in the back have
[1:23:29] it you know how they were building their
[1:23:31] own kingdom well he was tearing them up
[1:23:32] on youtube so we talked about building
[1:23:35] kingdoms
[1:23:36] but look build you a big church
[1:23:38] somewhere or some popularity or some
[1:23:41] other thing outside of increasing or in
[1:23:44] bettering the kingdom of god brother
[1:23:46] something's wrong
[1:23:51] something's wrong
[1:23:53] now when that old dead rod was brought
[1:23:55] in there and laid in the presence of god
[1:23:56] himself what happened
[1:23:58] it budded
[1:23:59] it blossomed it yielded through showing
[1:24:02] that we were born in in other words born
[1:24:04] in sin that rod was off of an almond
[1:24:07] tree and when it was cut off it died
[1:24:10] you and i were cut off we died
[1:24:14] but when a man was cut off from god he
[1:24:16] died spiritually
[1:24:18] but once brought into the place of god
[1:24:20] before the presence of god he comes to
[1:24:22] life and yields life yields fruit yields
[1:24:26] blossom yields fruit power of decision
[1:24:28] 1955. put aaron's rod in there old dead
[1:24:31] almond tree
[1:24:33] but as it went under the shekinah glory
[1:24:36] everything it was
[1:24:40] was restored again
[1:24:42] back to that genesis 1 26
[1:24:45] back to the garden of eden
[1:24:48] that's the way a sinner is when he goes
[1:24:50] under the shekinah glory of the holy
[1:24:52] spirit
[1:24:53] the veils drop behind him
[1:24:55] everything that he ought to have been a
[1:24:58] son of god
[1:24:59] blooms out in him
[1:25:01] again
[1:25:04] let's stand our feet
[1:25:07] i could keep on going but we'll stop
[1:25:09] right
[1:25:10] there i'll read this one musicians come
[1:25:13] on they took aaron's rod and laid
[1:25:14] aaron's rod in the presence of this holy
[1:25:16] place and when they did in one night's
[1:25:18] time it budded blossom yielded almonds
[1:25:20] in one night's time think of it
[1:25:23] in the presence of god this old dead rod
[1:25:28] this old dead rod
[1:25:30] lying there in the presence of god
[1:25:32] blooded blossom yielded almonds in one
[1:25:34] night what was it then what kind of a
[1:25:37] rod was it it was an almond tree rod
[1:25:40] that's what he'd taken it from the stick
[1:25:42] was off of an almond tree
[1:25:44] and you are a stick some kind
[1:25:47] you think i got this just out of my own
[1:25:48] head
[1:25:49] i had a quote for it
[1:25:52] the stick was off of an old almond tree
[1:25:54] and you are a stick some kind
[1:25:56] and you was taken off the branch of
[1:25:58] humanity
[1:25:59] which was god's created son in the
[1:26:01] beginning you may be fallen dead
[1:26:03] alienated from god but by that in
[1:26:06] creation you were created to be a son of
[1:26:09] god
[1:26:10] you were created to be an almond tree
[1:26:12] but you got cut off
[1:26:14] so god had to come down here and get cut
[1:26:15] off for you
[1:26:17] you may be falling dead alienated from
[1:26:19] god but by that in creation you were
[1:26:22] created to be a son of god you may
[1:26:24] bounce around
[1:26:26] and be respected and honored out here in
[1:26:29] the courts
[1:26:30] but if you ever get in that glorious
[1:26:32] place and hide away with god
[1:26:35] you'll yield what you're supposed to do
[1:26:40] live the church let it out
[1:26:43] yield what you're supposed to yield all
[1:26:44] of us are going to anyway
[1:26:47] all of us are

[1:31:28] settle right here on earth and these old
[1:31:30] dead sticks
[1:31:33] are going to live
[1:31:35] eternally
[1:31:37] in a place where you'll never see
[1:31:38] another dead stick
