[18:09] [Music]
[18:12] I want to see em I you know the Lord hey
[18:26] man you may be seated I got an
[18:29] announcement I gotta make on but this is
[18:31] just for church family so let's just
[18:33] keep it at that all right just keep us
[18:35] all in your prayers everything will work
[18:37] out just fine you know what I don't want
[18:41] I don't I don't want my friends to be
[18:43] around in this horrible time if the
[18:45] rapture comes and the tribulation begins
[18:49] I don't I wouldn't want any of my even
[18:51] center family to go through what people
[18:52] are gonna have to go through you look at
[18:54] all that stuff they're going through now
[18:56] wow that's just a man that's not even a
[19:00] blip on the screen of what's fixing to
[19:02] happen all right so in Mexico had
[19:04] another earthquake yesterday killed more
[19:07] people so it's a I was telling them this
[19:13] morning don't the only thing is holding
[19:15] back the big time the big the big boom
[19:17] is you and I but because these things
[19:20] are happening is because the church has
[19:23] come to a place I mean I was telling
[19:26] this morning I you talked about the 99
[19:29] sheep you know brother Dale is talking
[19:31] about going back and going back going
[19:32] back we do that because what he did we
[19:35] look we loop back to pick up something
[19:38] we don't just loop back again so you can
[19:41] know we loop back remember the 99 sheep
[19:45] the 99 sheep stayed in one place but
[19:49] that one sheep went astray and and the
[19:51] Shepherd went back to get that sheep
[19:53] right but now remember what happened to
[19:56] that sheep if he kept doing that he got
[19:59] a broke leg remember the Shepherd would
[20:02] break his leg with love he would break
[20:06] that sheep leg to keep him from running
[20:07] off and that's exactly what's happening
[20:09] now he may have to break our leg I told
[20:11] somebody the other day you know when
[20:12] Jacob was changed to Israel every time
[20:14] he got out of that bed and he limped he
[20:17] was a limping Prince he remembered when
[20:19] God met him and changed his name so that
[20:23] maybe what we have to do is loop back in
[20:25] get one breaker leg and bring them on
[20:27] button you know what get them in the
[20:28] fold
[20:29] that's all that matters so let's go to
[20:32] Revelations 10 I would ask you I've
[20:35] never asked you before but I'll ask you
[20:37] to please listen to Wednesday night

[22:03] these things in Jesus name Amen
[22:06] revelations 10 verse 1 and I saw another
[22:09] mighty angel come down from heaven
[22:10] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[22:13] upon his head and his face was as it
[22:14] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[22:16] fire now we know who that is we know
[22:18] that's Christ a man so he and he's
[22:20] coming down and he had in his little
[22:23] hand hidden his hand a little book open
[22:26] and he said his right foot upon the sea
[22:28] and his left foot upon the earth and
[22:29] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[22:31] roars and when he had cried seven
[22:33] thunders uttered their voices and when
[22:36] the seven thunders had uttered their
[22:37] voices I was about to
[22:39] and I heard a voice from heaven saying
[22:40] unto me seal up those things which the
[22:42] seven thunders uttered and write them
[22:44] not in the angel which I saw stand upon
[22:47] the sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[22:48] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[22:50] liveth for ever and ever who created
[22:51] heaven and the things that are therein
[22:53] are and the earth and the things that
[22:55] therein are and the sea and the things
[22:57] that are therein that there should be
[22:59] time no longer but in the days of the
[23:02] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[23:03] begin to sound the mystery singular
[23:06] mystery of God should be finished as he
[23:09] hath declared to his servants the
[23:12] prophets now let's go to Ephesians 4
[23:13] verse 29 let no corrupt communication
[23:17] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[23:19] is good to the use of edifying that it
[23:21] may Minister grace unto the hearers
[23:23] that's what we're trying to do today and
[23:25] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[23:27] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[23:30] redemption let all bitterness and wrath
[23:32] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[23:34] be put away from you with all malice how
[23:37] about that and be ye kind one to another
[23:39] it sounds like a statue of a perfect man
[23:41] to me and be you come one to another
[23:43] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[23:44] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[23:46] forgiven you you may be seated in the
[23:49] Lord at his blessing to the reading of

[24:49] Wednesday those of you that weren't here
[24:50] that we were talking about
[24:52] Aseel now get into it also but you got
[24:55] to remember in a minute but you'll
[24:57] remember that a seal back in the old
[25:00] time there was not a book it was rolled
[25:03] up like this
[25:04] it's called a scroll okay and it would
[25:08] be sealed with a with a signatory thurr
[25:10] with they used to seal them with beeswax
[25:12] or they would seal them with some kind
[25:14] of paraffin wax and it would seal the
[25:17] document okay so we'll get into that in
[25:19] just a little while but I want to go
[25:22] through this and read the first quote
[25:25] here from brother Branham in the
[25:27] Laodicean Church age because you and I I
[25:32] was telling them or me and brother Lewis
[25:34] was talking yesterday we are we are a
[25:37] people that have come from something to
[25:41] something amen
[25:43] we come from somewhere to somewhere else
[25:46] all right because remember you and I
[25:48] have a commission that we have now a
[25:53] prophet that has come on the scene
[25:55] brought the message left the scene and
[25:57] has give that Commission - you and I -
[26:03] you and I to finish this thing mmm
[26:06] so in this in this quote here we want to
[26:08] take and divide like we did wins the
[26:10] afternoon lattice in church age now this
[26:13] messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10
[26:16] 7 is going to do two things one
[26:17] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[26:20] hearts of the children to the father's 2
[26:22] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[26:25] seven thunders in Revelations 10 which
[26:27] are the revelations contained in the
[26:30] seven seals now we read that's Wednesday
[26:32] night look it didn't say that the seven
[26:35] seals were the revelation of it was the
[26:38] thunders because remember it's two
[26:39] different things I'll read you the quote
[26:41] in a little while he will reveal the
[26:43] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[26:44] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[26:46] contained in the seven seals alright it
[26:51] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[26:53] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[26:55] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[26:58] exactly so there but but now watch
[27:01] keep reading but consider this also this
[27:04] prophet messenger will be in
[27:05] his nature and manner as were Elijah and
[27:08] John the people of this prophet
[27:11] messengers day these people these people
[27:16] of this prophet messengers day will be
[27:19] as they were in Ahab's day and in John's
[27:22] and since it is only the children whose
[27:27] hearts will be turned by it it is only
[27:29] the children who will listen mmm hey man
[27:32] it'd be just children that'll listen now
[27:35] let's read this next one we read it wins
[27:37] tonight but we're gonna read it again
[27:38] and then we'll kind of break the chart
[27:39] down a little bit and see what's going
[27:42] on
[27:43] now listen faith 1953 this is 1953
[27:48] listen god bless you I want to tell you
[27:50] just one thing I know I'm holding long
[27:52] but I just want this one little thing I
[27:54] know I want you to remember there's
[27:56] something fixing to happen now this is
[27:58] 1953 remember I told you that there's a
[28:01] step up coming in the church now see
[28:04] these things that you're now seeing are
[28:06] going to be just little things after a
[28:08] while some things are moving and I say
[28:12] this by the power of the revelation now
[28:14] look I said you better pay attention
[28:16] when the Prophet says that I say this by
[28:19] the power of the revelation of Jesus
[28:21] Christ whom I everyone in our doctrine
[28:24] and our baptism we've come to a place
[28:27] but there's some key that will unlock
[28:30] something here now he saw the book
[28:33] sealed on seven seals and when the
[28:34] Daniel saw the same and when the
[28:37] thunders under their voices he said
[28:38] don't write what was in the scripture
[28:41] but it would it had be revealed in the
[28:44] last day we're at the time we're at
[28:46] Kadish right now all right so he told us
[28:50] where we were that all right amen
[28:54] so now I want to kind of show you where
[28:57] we're at if that's all right I won't
[29:03] know what you can see better I don't
[29:04] know if you can see that blue or the
[29:05] black which one can you see better the
[29:09] black okay all right all right so now we
[29:17] got to go back to what we're looking at
[29:23] turn that way look can you still see
[29:27] excuse me
[29:28] all right now we know what that is
[29:35] that's the that's the drawing of the
[29:37] statute perfectly I'm not gonna put
[29:38] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[29:39] patience that all right okay so now but
[29:43] now you know one thing's for sure this
[29:44] is church age one two three four five
[29:48] six seven right that's a that's a that's
[29:52] the seven church age as you see them
[29:54] where he put those in there and then you
[29:57] got your gap you know here but now you
[29:59] got a gap here but now remember in the
[30:05] message in the Bible they told us that
[30:10] what the headstone was rejected the
[30:13] man's done all right
[30:14] so that's the way the pyramids the
[30:16] natural Pyramid of Egypt that's the way
[30:18] it look and then there was no cap put on
[30:21] the top of it but now remember who is
[30:23] the headstone Christ
[30:26] so when Christ was here this is the way
[30:29] this looked you could put his head here
[30:32] and his body here because we are the
[30:33] body that all right we're the body he
[30:36] was walking on the earth the total
[30:39] stature of a perfect man that all rights
[30:43] amen all right so he's this total
[30:45] picture but what happened right here in
[30:51] this time frame now listen to me in this
[30:55] time frame
[30:55] my brother Dale was talking he didn't
[30:57] know what I was gonna be doing today
[31:01] okay I see that now Rick remember he
[31:06] wants to son of man but the Son of God
[31:10] revelation was what the church ages was
[31:12] under amen now the Son of Man is this
[31:16] thing right here the whole thing that's
[31:21] the son of man Revelation but you got to
[31:24] have this before you can get to this
[31:26] that all right all right so you got this
[31:30] revelation through seven Church ages
[31:33] then you've got a gap right here that
[31:38] says Holy Spirit demands that all right
[31:41] and then this is the son of man or the
[31:47] headstone or the capstone the fullness
[31:51] of Jesus Christ is that all right are
[31:56] the revelation of the seals is that all
[32:02] right so you got because remember no one
[32:05] the seals were closed up it was sealed
[32:13] with seven seals sure there was a
[32:16] revelation inside here this put people
[32:22] in the body of Christ I was telling them
[32:24] this morning in a Sunday School class
[32:27] listen everyone has the spirit of
[32:30] adoption according to Romans 8 we have
[32:34] the spirit of adoption crying daddy
[32:38] daddy or I bye father that's what that
[32:40] means
[32:41] well now mature son I don't go to the
[32:44] daddy's house and start crying for him
[32:48] but as a baby I did amen
[32:52] so we received the spirit of adoption so
[32:54] we have received the spirit of adoption
[32:57] even in the church ages I said the
[32:59] spirit of adoption which what puts us in
[33:03] the family as sons remember the prodigal
[33:07] son he was a son the daddy there's no
[33:13] way the daddy could kick him out of the
[33:15] family now the son left and then he come
[33:20] back amen
[33:21] but he was still a son in the same way
[33:25] with you and I sons and daughters of God
[33:27] just like what brother Dale said this
[33:29] morning because I read that scripture in
[33:31] Ephesians 4 says grieve not the Holy
[33:33] Spirit of God and brother Claude now
[33:35] we're talking he's on adoption we were
[33:37] talking not before laughs the only thing
[33:41] that stops you from being a
[33:44] opted is you it's all late on you cuz in
[33:52] a natural sense I can help if I owned a
[33:55] big business or even a little business
[33:57] and I took Josh and I gave him because
[33:59] you know what I've got the intelligence
[34:01] for it
[34:03] I'm the owner I'm the one that's went
[34:06] through all the seven or eight or ten
[34:08] years of ups and downs in business and
[34:10] you know employees and this and you know
[34:14] all this bills and see I know that why
[34:16] because I'm the father but I teach it to
[34:20] Josh and I keep teaching it to Josh and
[34:22] he keeps going I I don't I don't want I
[34:26] don't want anything do that now whose
[34:29] choice is that I'm doing everything I
[34:31] can do God's doing everything he can do
[34:33] to make everybody a manifested son of
[34:36] God walking with headship but you and I
[34:41] can grieve that Holy Spirit like brother
[34:43] Dale said this morning but you will not
[34:46] ever reach this spot right here never
[34:50] will you reach that spot until the body
[34:53] change now the body changed but now what
[34:57] you got to do first you got to pass away
[34:58] you got to die so that's just the way it
[35:02] is I'm sorry all right that okay so we
[35:08] stop we grieve the Holy Spirit brother
[35:10] Brown said God I go out on a limb and
[35:12] said now he's not going to come out of
[35:14] you and go sit down on a stump that is a
[35:17] illustration that God will withhold from
[35:20] you
[35:21] remember watch what he did with brother
[35:23] Branham remember when he didn't go out
[35:25] on the field he listened to his first
[35:26] wife God scolded him he said you didn't
[35:30] listen to me you listen to your
[35:31] mother-in-law in other words and this is
[35:34] why you're going through what you're
[35:35] going through what he had to go through
[35:37] that so he could be an adopted son so he
[35:40] could be the person that God always
[35:43] wanted him to be that all right so now
[35:50] I've lost month I mean to make that
[35:54] build thing my thing
[35:55] so right here we have sons and daughters
[36:00] of God walking in the Word of God is
[36:03] that Alright say man this is also the
[36:07] faith of the fathers just like to pull
[36:10] that quote back up please
[36:23] you know go back and read that one yet
[36:27] this one no the first one sorry we'll
[36:32] get it right in a minute the first one
[36:33] all right know what this Mexican
[36:36] mountain can't afford to do two things
[36:37] one according to my account for he's to
[36:39] turn the hearts of the children to the
[36:41] father's he's to turn the hearts of the
[36:43] what the babbling Pentecostal baby
[36:45] children cuz this is where he comes in
[36:48] this age right he turns them back to the
[36:51] faith of the foundation fathers which
[36:54] the faith of the father's dough covers
[36:57] there's no way that Peter could teach us
[36:59] and to your faith virtue knowledge
[37:01] template patient godless brother Kenneth
[37:03] without him having that faith without
[37:06] him having that revelation our
[37:09] foundation Peter couldn't preach that
[37:12] you can't preach what you don't know you
[37:15] can presume but you're not exactly
[37:17] correct so the faith of the fathers
[37:20] we're to be turned back now that doesn't
[37:22] mean we got to go back down to the
[37:23] bottom of the pyramid but it does mean
[37:26] that we he takes those what children
[37:30] only the children whose hearts will be
[37:34] turned it is only the children who will
[37:37] listen
[37:37] that's why then Pentecostals stayed
[37:40] stuck in that church age they didn't
[37:45] they weren't turned back into children
[37:48] from children to mature what with the
[37:52] faith of the fathers brother Ram said
[37:54] they were mature group of people of the
[37:56] group of Ephesus a big Church of 12
[38:03] don't even enough to hardly have
[38:04] sunday-school class but they were the
[38:07] most powerful Church of the time why
[38:10] give me 12 born-again believers and you
[38:13] can do more with 12 born-again believers
[38:15] and you can 150 that don't believe and
[38:18] then but were turned back to the faith
[38:20] of the fathers he says exactly
[38:23] now watch but now - he's got the second
[38:27] part that this Malachi 4 person is
[38:30] supposed to bring he will reveal the
[38:32] mystery of the seven thunders and
[38:34] relations 10 now you come out of my life
[38:37] for a mint we're out of Melancon for now
[38:41] Malachi 4 come what to turn the hearts
[38:44] of the of the children to the father's
[38:46] now I'm gonna write this on here but
[38:52] you're gonna have to listen to what I'm
[38:53] saying this is 1947 to 1963 ish now you
[39:04] say well then we need to throw them
[39:06] tapes away no if you don't understand
[39:10] this you'll never get this so what
[39:14] brother Brown was doing was that was
[39:15] they what he was doing a restoration
[39:18] what he called it
[39:19] tying up loose ends and then tying up
[39:24] loose ends what from here to here I
[39:26] showed you in the evenin the Catholic
[39:29] Encyclopedia they then they no they
[39:33] changed the baptism they no they changed
[39:35] Father Son Holy I mean from Lord Jesus
[39:37] Christ to father son Holy Ghost they no
[39:40] they went from the one god theory not
[39:43] theory but revelation to their theory of
[39:46] three gods or three and one right well
[39:49] that was through these ages that that
[39:51] happened amen
[39:53] what happened was is here's eternity man
[39:57] goes like this
[39:59] this is the eternal Word of God so what
[40:02] is this and this that's a loose end
[40:05] brother branham came to what fill in the
[40:07] gap to where it would be what one
[40:10] continuous flow of Revelation
[40:13] why so God could talk to brother Branham
[40:16] not exactly so that God could talk to me
[40:19] and you amen so now you got the faith of
[40:26] the fathers you've got what the
[40:28] restoration back to what they believe
[40:31] down here that all right say man what
[40:35] they believe down here was you can say
[40:39] erode it or even done away with by most
[40:44] people in denominations by the time he
[40:45] gets to here that's why this is the
[40:48] worst
[40:48] church age we're supposed to have the
[40:50] most light the most revelation the most
[40:53] correct doctrine yet we are full of now
[40:57] when brother Branham was here was 969
[41:00] two different denominations now there's
[41:01] thirteen thousand different
[41:03] denominations in the world it's God that
[41:06] confused no we are amen so it brings us
[41:12] back to and I said thank God for the
[41:14] revelation I was telling them Wednesday
[41:16] night for those of you who weren't here
[41:17] thank God you know for me for me myself
[41:21] a revelation that I don't have to stand
[41:24] at the white throne judgment to me it's
[41:26] an absolute what I get up in the morning
[41:30] I get up in the morning believing that I
[41:33] am a son of God and I don't have to
[41:35] stand in front of no judgment except the
[41:38] deeds of the body done whether good or
[41:40] bad
[41:41] not from my eternal salvation I don't
[41:44] have to be the one that stands in front
[41:46] of that white throne no we will actually
[41:48] be the white throne amen that to me that
[41:53] just thrills my soul then the prophet of
[41:55] God could pull that out of the word it's
[41:58] always been in there amen hit right on
[42:02] you Bible
[42:03] I'm not writing a new Bible this has
[42:05] never been in the Bible and then it just
[42:09] took a what a prophet to put it together
[42:10] it took a prophet to line it up like I
[42:13] told you winds tonight you know you can
[42:15] have a ten thousand dollar set of
[42:16] binoculars but if it's not focused it's
[42:19] worthless you can't see no more and you
[42:21] can't attend dollar from back from about
[42:22] here to to neither back there you can't
[42:26] see a thing I don't care if you paid
[42:28] $100,000 for binoculars if it's not in
[42:30] focus the property God brought the word
[42:33] back into focus and brought the full
[42:37] continuity of the Word of God that all
[42:39] right
[42:40] so we have the revelation of the son of
[42:43] God in through seven church ages the
[42:45] faith of the father's is all the faith
[42:48] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[42:49] dogs brotherly kindness working in a
[42:51] group of people is that right
[42:55] but remember this was rejected so this
[43:00] was not here during the church
[43:02] Changez yeah you say oh well he was yes
[43:05] he was he was down here working in the
[43:07] people but not like he wanted to I've
[43:12] got a quote here I couldn't pull it up
[43:14] back there because they don't have it
[43:15] fixed but brother Brown said in 1964
[43:18] Feast of the trumpets the holy spirit
[43:20] has been bound for two thousand years
[43:22] under seven Sabbath's which is 49 this
[43:25] is your forty nine seven church age of
[43:29] seven times seven is forty-nine and he
[43:32] said could not get all the way out they
[43:37] were stuck amen
[43:41] stuck in the church ages yes why by
[43:44] doctrine but brother Brown said to be
[43:48] freed in the end time by the message of
[43:52] Malachi for which the real message of
[43:55] Milan time for that's the real message
[43:57] of Malachi for not this but you don't
[44:03] have this if you sleep through this like
[44:05] you're sleeping now you're not gonna get
[44:07] that you're not gonna get it this is
[44:11] your foundation faith of the father's
[44:15] foundation first remember that's why
[44:17] we're calling it a foundation for the
[44:19] seals we had to come out of the church
[44:22] ages to understand the seals cuz right
[44:26] here this is you Jubilee cuz who is that
[44:28] you believe Christ is the Jubilee he's
[44:31] the one they've been looking for all
[44:33] these years not someday or not some
[44:36] fiftieth day no the day of the Lord the
[44:40] 50th Jubilee has not happened on earth
[44:44] timewise that's in the Millennium but
[44:49] you and I by the baptism of the Holy
[44:51] Ghost we have been birthed out of the
[44:53] church ages into Christ which is 250
[44:57] waiting for the world to come to that is
[45:01] that all right say ma'am
[45:02] all right I'm gonna make you say man cuz
[45:05] I know you're not going to
[45:12] you say what are you talking about
[45:14] brother wait remember Wednesday night
[45:23] we're gonna read it in just a minute
[45:26] brother Branham preached seven church
[45:28] ages and they were vindicated by the
[45:31] angel of the Lord he drew the circles
[45:34] just like the moon's he drew him he said
[45:36] he said the Holy Spirit came upon the
[45:38] back side of the wall of a tabernacle
[45:39] and drew the same identical thing right
[45:42] seven Church ages but that still seven
[45:46] times seven couldn't get them all the
[45:50] way out cuz all the way member 49
[45:52] Leviticus 25 eight only part go free but
[45:58] Leviticus 25:10 in the fiftieth
[46:00] everything goes free amen
[46:03] that's what you and I are looking at but
[46:06] this the revelation had it sealed up
[46:11] here remember now look I was telling
[46:16] them it down Sunday school class and I
[46:19] was telling Lewis yesterday the seals
[46:21] have been preached twice already
[46:30] Jesus preached him in Matthew 24 and
[46:33] brother Branham preached him in 1963
[46:36] amen
[46:37] now let me show you something else you
[46:40] talk about adoption remember 2 to 3 in
[46:43] the mouth of two or three witnesses
[46:44] right the first adopted son was who Adam
[46:49] he had complete control
[46:51] God didn't have to come down every day
[46:54] and say Adam now you need that right
[46:55] Adam you don't need to name that Tiger
[46:57] know whatever Adam said God backed it up
[47:01] that's why the Bible calls you but under
[47:04] God
[47:04] then you've got the man himself
[47:10] obviously he was taken up on a mountain
[47:12] in Matthew 17 and was adopted in front
[47:15] of the decide the three witnesses right
[47:17] Peter James and John and then you've got
[47:20] brother Branham he said how do you know
[47:23] well
[47:26] I'm a reading here in just a minute but
[47:28] remember when he went up on the mountain
[47:30] before the seals opening this sword came
[47:32] in his hand what was the sword it was
[47:37] the word and he said it fit my hand
[47:40] perfect that's when God was saying if
[47:44] you're gonna hear anything I have give
[47:46] my word to this man and if you're gonna
[47:49] hear anything this is who you're gonna
[47:51] hear from a man that all right so look
[47:53] you say well there's three for a witness
[47:55] that's exactly correct
[47:56] but how about you and I you not have to
[48:00] come to the sword in hand you and I have
[48:02] to come to a place of adoption well you
[48:04] got quiet on that one we are you gonna
[48:08] stop yourself unbeliever but then this
[48:13] would be the revelation of the seals the
[48:18] revelation of the Son of Man so you got
[48:19] three parts what brother ramped now I
[48:21] want to show you there's a gap in here
[48:22] but brother branham preach to all the
[48:25] church ages got them all correct got
[48:26] them all lined up got the cow eating
[48:28] grass on the ground the tree
[48:30] everything's in place right but there
[48:33] was a part missing then there was a part
[48:37] missing right here now the ones that
[48:41] were and I hate to say this but the ones
[48:42] that were stuck in this these ages down
[48:45] here
[48:47] let's read now you don't think they were
[48:50] stuck listen to what he said it's gonna
[48:53] be a long reading so just bear with me
[48:56] but we're gonna read it anyway that all
[48:57] right number three now this is questions
[49:04] and answers y'all just heard it the
[49:06] other day when he said it and honed the
[49:07] questions and answers but watch what he
[49:09] says he says and then also knowing that
[49:12] right among you things are happening I
[49:14] just I know I know you that you don't
[49:17] see it I'm just positive that you don't
[49:21] see it you say brethren that's a hard
[49:24] thing for you to say say that I know it
[49:28] is but look let me just say this now I
[49:31] suppose this is just taped for ourselves
[49:33] and so forth but let me say this see
[49:35] that you don't get it and you're not so
[49:38] folks to get it folks that's why I it's
[49:44] gonna be a razor's edge but somebody's
[49:49] got to be on it
[49:50] amen somebody's gonna be have to be on
[49:53] the other side of this revelation if we
[49:56] stay right here death has taken
[49:59] everybody in this compartment you may
[50:03] say death has taken there's not one man
[50:05] come out of the tomb except one and he
[50:09] was before all this and he was the
[50:12] totality of it all
[50:15] Peter couldn't tell us about the chains
[50:18] of the body he never experienced him
[50:20] Paul could speak of it
[50:21] he'd never experienced it but Jesus
[50:23] could tell us about it what through the
[50:26] prophets amen
[50:28] but you're not supposed to get it so
[50:31] don't try to interpret anything that's
[50:32] the problem
[50:33] they started interpreting for 54 years
[50:36] they've been interpreting the seven
[50:38] seals what the seals are what the
[50:39] thunders are what this is what that is
[50:41] they've made it seven men they made it
[50:43] polygamy they made it everything they
[50:45] wanted to make it except back to the
[50:47] simplicity watch this just take my
[50:51] advice if you believe me now
[50:53] if God has given me favor in your sight
[50:56] and you know them revelations and things
[50:58] I've been here within a long time
[50:59] I'll always and it's always been right
[51:02] now to double prove it right it hooks
[51:04] right back in with the word see so you
[51:07] know it's dust set the Lord that's
[51:09] exactly see it's prove to you now take
[51:11] my advice as your brother don't put your
[51:13] own interpretation anything you're just
[51:15] going to live a good Christian life why
[51:17] this is a good Christian life the faith
[51:21] of the fathers and there's an absolute
[51:23] great Christian life I wish we had
[51:25] everybody living that life me included
[51:30] you're just going to live a good
[51:32] Christian life because you'll only wind
[51:35] yourself away what from I didn't I
[51:38] didn't make that read but I should have
[51:39] from the real thing when you do it see
[51:43] you'll only wind your way again away
[51:46] from the thing and all of your conscious
[51:48] and know that there's something
[51:49] mysterious happening and it's
[51:52] happening and I know what it is now I'm
[51:55] not saying that it's the grace of God
[51:59] that lets me know what it is it's
[52:02] something that's tremendous and it's
[52:04] gone right now
[52:05] now watch because remember when we move
[52:10] over into this foundation a little bit
[52:11] more we're gonna talk about the third
[52:13] pole this is before we even get into the
[52:14] seals because brother Ram says the third
[52:17] pole is laying dormant now you know he
[52:19] said that the third pole laying dormant
[52:21] now okay well he said but he said it's
[52:27] gone from you right now because he's
[52:28] fixing to tell them it's the third pole
[52:30] but it's gone from you right now and
[52:32] there's not a way in the world for you
[52:35] to see it and it's but so help me with
[52:39] this Bible in my hand I know what it is
[52:41] it's been told you before so just don't
[52:43] try to put any interpretation but just
[52:46] believe me as your brother we're living
[52:48] in a great hour we're living in a time
[52:50] where though well well we just be real
[52:52] humble be a Christian try to live for
[52:54] God live honest with your fellow man
[52:56] listen we got to get to that part before
[52:58] we get up to the top live honest with
[53:02] your fellow man and love those who don't
[53:04] love you that's brotherly kindness it's
[53:08] easy to love somebody loves you don't
[53:11] try to make any you see you do you only
[53:14] make it a mysterious something and
[53:16] that's the real program of God up you
[53:20] see what are you saying you only make it
[53:22] a mysterious something because the real
[53:25] program of God is not a mysterious
[53:27] something but yet it is yesterday
[53:31] afternoon something happened in my room
[53:32] that I'll never be able to leave it you
[53:34] see so you about two weeks ago something
[53:36] happened they'll never be able to law as
[53:38] long as I live I'll never be able to get
[53:40] away from it saying so but if the church
[53:43] you're not supposed to know these things
[53:45] so don't put no interpretation to
[53:47] anything see you just go ahead and just
[53:49] remember what I told you live a
[53:51] Christian life go to your church be a
[53:53] real light wherever you are and just
[53:55] burn for Christ tell the people how you
[53:57] love them just let your testimony be
[53:59] with love all the time with the people
[54:01] see because if you don't you twist
[54:03] yourself out into something there
[54:05] and then you're off the beaten track now
[54:09] listen we've obviously been off the
[54:11] beaten track if this is the greatest
[54:14] message the seals is the greatest
[54:15] message that's ever been preached since
[54:18] the beginning of time and we just let it
[54:21] lay on the pages so every time you try
[54:24] to do it you've done that see so just
[54:28] don't don't try to make no
[54:30] interpretation and especially tonight
[54:32] when that seal becomes up in front of
[54:34] you now what's he talking about the
[54:36] Seventh Seal because that night he
[54:39] preaches the Seventh Seal see just don't
[54:41] try to interpret it you just go ahead
[54:43] and just be humbled go right on with the
[54:45] same plain message now you say brother
[54:48] Branham is that we being the Church of

[55:36] it got radio see there's warnings and
[55:39] things can be done like a sword in your
[55:41] hands watch him slide that in there
[55:43] there's warnings and things can be done
[55:46] like a sword he's got my radio so it can
[55:50] pick from the evil are pick from only as
[55:54] it gets its message see now but now for
[55:58] instance to the ordinary man there's
[56:01] been so many cults and clans rise up
[56:03] over this little out pour into the
[56:06] spirit until people gets all worked up
[56:08] and a bunch of stuff go out starting a
[56:10] little move and you know things and
[56:11] things see you don't want to do that now
[56:14] see now remember just stay the way you
[56:16] are and you say well the Lord show no
[56:19] look what he done well the lordship no
[56:23] no not just be careful hey now look here
[56:27] let me show you something did you know
[56:28] there's 10,000 voices in this room right
[56:31] now literal voices of people that's
[56:35] coming through the electronic waves of
[56:37] radio why don't you hear them why don't
[56:41] you hear them their voices is that right
[56:45] they're waving right through here now
[56:48] there's people forms bodies moving right
[56:50] through this room now is that right well
[56:52] why don't you see them why don't you see
[56:56] them they're here actual voices like my
[57:03] voice well why don't you hear them see
[57:04] it's gonna strike something first to
[57:07] reveal it it's got to strike something
[57:12] first to reveal it now he wasn't telling
[57:16] he wasn't telling them people they
[57:18] didn't have anything he just said they
[57:20] didn't have what was needed at the
[57:22] moment to strike what he was talking
[57:25] about that alright say man now do you
[57:28] understand so just don't interpret
[57:30] nothing if God wants you to know
[57:32] anything he will send it to you so just
[57:36] be real real solid now hold still
[57:38] something has happened and I'm telling
[57:41] you now something has happened now just
[57:43] be real you understand what I mean don't
[57:45] you and just be don't try to make
[57:47] yourself odd to be a Christian because
[57:49] you take yourself away from God and you
[57:51] you you if you can understand this is
[57:53] that third Paul you should have got that
[57:56] the other day now obviously they didn't
[58:00] by discernment he knew they weren't
[58:02] getting it especially when he told them
[58:08] to ask questions on the seals and they
[58:10] started asking about pen Howe by me it
[58:15] wasn't a time it wasn't a time you
[58:19] remember they'll be no impersonation
[58:22] like there was of the other two listen
[58:25] this can be impersonated brother
[58:28] Robinson you can have a part of those
[58:30] virtues and not even be a Christian but
[58:32] you can't have
[58:33] love of God and not be a Christian and
[58:36] then so now just remember that you see
[58:39] now there's something taking place in
[58:41] this room he said right here in this
[58:45] room and there's something here there's
[58:48] Ashlee in this room angels watch this
[58:51] voice of God but how do you you can't if
[58:56] you can't hear the natural voice without
[58:59] something to send it out how you going
[59:01] to hear the spiritual voice it wasn't
[59:03] that they were not getting a revelation
[59:05] they got a revelation but it wasn't the
[59:08] revelation that this is talking about
[59:13] now you might make believe that somebody
[59:17] is singing this certain song that might
[59:19] not even be there see but when it
[59:23] actually strikes now most of you don't
[59:26] even know that a radio all of us older
[59:30] ones do I can remember when a radio was
[59:34] an option in a car
[59:35] I know y'all can - air conditioning was
[59:38] an option okay
[59:40] daddy would cut the air conditioner off
[59:41] going up a hill to save gas right anyway
[59:47] but a radio instead of being digital it
[59:52] had crystals in it it actually had
[59:53] diamonds in it don't know that radio had
[59:57] a crystal in it that was cut a certain
[59:59] way that's why that when a m55 they had
[1:00:04] a certain crystal in a m55 radio station
[1:00:07] and you had an am 55 crystal in your
[1:00:10] station now if you were off on another
[1:00:11] station you'd get in less than am 55 hey
[1:00:15] man WD you in I'm giving them a plug
[1:00:17] here W in am 55 in Gainesville if you
[1:00:21] had it if you had it or 750w SBF off its
[1:00:25] your right yeah that's right
[1:00:27] 750 was WSB right but you could pick up
[1:00:31] 750 if you were on 550 the crystal
[1:00:35] wasn't cut the right way you didn't have
[1:00:37] the right crystal to receive what was
[1:00:40] being sin I hope you get this but when
[1:00:43] it actually strikes the crystal that
[1:00:45] it's supposed to strike
[1:00:48] that's us that's you and I today when it
[1:00:54] actually strikes the crystal that is
[1:00:56] supposed to strike then it gives a true
[1:00:59] true interpretation and vindicates it by
[1:01:03] showing the picture see what I mean it
[1:01:08] shows us the clear picture it shows
[1:01:12] clarity it gives us what faith from the
[1:01:19] faith of the fathers we're coming
[1:01:21] through seven Church ages absolutely
[1:01:23] we're coming through what we're coming
[1:01:25] through all these virtues all the church
[1:01:28] ages are gone sure we're living in
[1:01:32] Laodicea we know that but I thought we
[1:01:35] got to be called out of the church a
[1:01:37] bride never was in an age in their soul
[1:01:42] but we still have the time element of
[1:01:46] that church age is that all right we
[1:01:48] live in the Laodicean Church age but we
[1:01:51] are not of that layout of century if
[1:01:53] we're still of that Laodicean Church age
[1:01:55] we're not even in this picture that I'm
[1:01:58] drawing
[1:01:58] you're not even down here because when
[1:02:01] you're born again as a baby you're born
[1:02:02] again right down here right down here
[1:02:06] the action you birth but Paul even Peter
[1:02:11] knew they said being born again by the
[1:02:16] incorruptible Word of God which liveth
[1:02:18] and abideth forever is that all right
[1:02:20] say man all right so we're looking at a
[1:02:22] birth and then what I was telling you
[1:02:24] Sunday and then we'll get into this for
[1:02:29] just a second so what happened when
[1:02:32] brother Branham he goes and I'll read it
[1:02:34] here in just a minute but I'm gonna run
[1:02:36] through it real quick we see that he
[1:02:39] preached the seven Church ages lined
[1:02:41] them up corrected the way they're
[1:02:43] supposed to be put all the prophets or
[1:02:47] church age messengers remember when he
[1:02:50] got to Irina's he was looking at
[1:02:52] Polycarp because public art was closed
[1:02:55] but remember Polycarp leaned just a
[1:02:57] little bit to organized religion the
[1:02:59] Holy Spirit said no
[1:03:00] that's not the man Irina since the man
[1:03:03] so he line them all up he lined up all
[1:03:07] the what faith of the fathers and then
[1:03:10] he comes to 1963 he comes to 1963 and
[1:03:15] even in spoken words reading the seed he
[1:03:17] said he said Lord in other words he
[1:03:20] thought he thought this was all of it
[1:03:24] Lord had got him out on a limb what do I
[1:03:27] do and he says of yet Malachi for now
[1:03:29] remember you got to take that and see
[1:03:33] that the first part of Malachi 4 was
[1:03:35] fulfilled turn the hearts of the white
[1:03:41] children to the father's that was done
[1:03:45] spoke original seed he said but as of
[1:03:48] yet Malachi 4 has not been what in other
[1:03:50] words made manifest in other words the
[1:03:52] totality of the of the message of
[1:03:55] brother Branham takes us from the bottom
[1:03:56] of the pyramid all the way up through
[1:03:59] even to the headstone no one no one came
[1:04:06] to this place they're right here stuck
[1:04:12] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:04:17] but there's a gap right here and it says
[1:04:20] holy spirit that all right and like I
[1:04:24] told you son Wednesday night what is
[1:04:27] that gap that gap is a breach amen
[1:04:33] brother Branham goes to the breach and I
[1:04:36] think I've got it here for don't I read
[1:04:37] it next Sunday and he says we've come to
[1:04:40] here and now there's a breach now what's
[1:04:42] the name of that sermon the breach
[1:04:44] between the seven church ages and the
[1:04:47] seven sealed there's a gap or a breach
[1:04:50] now remember what I told you now breach
[1:04:52] I was telling you it's just how the Lord
[1:04:56] deals with me I saw a big pregnant lady
[1:04:58] I'm shorting big she was this big and I
[1:05:01] don't know whether she was talking about
[1:05:02] a breech birth or I just it just came to
[1:05:05] my mind and then I my mind went back to
[1:05:07] the breach and to confirm that the Lord
[1:05:09] showed me something again yesterday
[1:05:11] because remember in a breech birth your
[1:05:14] turned with the feet down that's not the
[1:05:18] way he's supposed to be born and the
[1:05:20] Lord told me yesterday I was just
[1:05:21] thinking about though well you know what
[1:05:22] maybe people didn't understand what I
[1:05:24] was talking about but what is a breech
[1:05:25] birth it's feet first then you got the
[1:05:30] head last the Lord said no he had to
[1:05:34] turn us back because we're in the
[1:05:37] headstone the head has got to come first
[1:05:40] a real birth the head comes first so in
[1:05:45] the breech the prophet of God was
[1:05:47] breaching the church ages where we want
[1:05:49] sure they were born again sure they had
[1:05:51] the baptism the Holy Ghost but they had
[1:05:53] they were in a breach where they
[1:05:54] couldn't get to the revelation of the
[1:05:57] Son of Man that's why the Holy Spirit is
[1:05:59] here it's not another Holy Spirit it's
[1:06:02] the Holy Ghost that's telling us about
[1:06:05] our birth about redemption ain't came
[1:06:10] spilling but that's what God's give us
[1:06:13] people
[1:06:13] he's bridged that gap telling us about
[1:06:18] Revelations father you got to get
[1:06:21] revelations 5 before the seals can open
[1:06:24] amen and then all right so there's your
[1:06:28] breech we were about to have a breech
[1:06:30] birth we couldn't get birthed out of the
[1:06:32] ages he told us we couldn't in the Feast
[1:06:34] of the trumpets he said he couldn't get
[1:06:35] all the way out
[1:06:37] hey there was a conception there was a
[1:06:41] baby getting ready to be born it was
[1:06:44] just getting ready to be born the wrong
[1:06:45] way so what brother branham literally
[1:06:49] that's why that quote literally turned
[1:06:51] us turned us back to what not just the
[1:06:55] faith of this father but the face of
[1:06:56] that one hey man that's what the son of
[1:06:59] man revelation is is the opening of
[1:07:02] those seven seals that all right say man
[1:07:05] now let's read for just a second right
[1:07:08] here I get all worked up because it to
[1:07:10] me it like is I'm happy I'm just happy
[1:07:13] I'm just happy that the Lord fitted all
[1:07:16] the other is this the sign of the insert
[1:07:18] number four the seventh angel
[1:07:21] revelations 10 seven is the seventh
[1:07:23] church age messenger now watch in the
[1:07:26] days now watch here
[1:07:28] now this is the scripture right here
[1:07:29] okay this is Scripture but in the days
[1:07:31] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:07:32] he begins to sound the mystery of God
[1:07:35] should be finished now sounding forth
[1:07:37] this mentioned you're the seventh angel
[1:07:39] here it's the sound forth his message to
[1:07:41] the Laodicean church notice his type of
[1:07:43] message now it wasn't to the first angel
[1:07:48] wasn't given that second third fourth
[1:07:51] fifth six but in the seventh angel that
[1:07:54] had this type of message what is it
[1:07:59] Paul brought a message looks like a mess
[1:08:01] done it Paul brought a message but what
[1:08:03] happened to Paul it wasn't Paul but his
[1:08:05] church age the people in his church age
[1:08:07] what started going down
[1:08:09] that's what brother Graham said you know
[1:08:11] talking about the church ages the church
[1:08:13] ages you had the gap in here well there
[1:08:15] was the one that was a porter that come
[1:08:16] in here Paul come at the end of the age
[1:08:19] into the Pentecostal age to bring his
[1:08:22] message to Ephesus well when that light
[1:08:24] started going out God brought another
[1:08:26] messenger Irene yes but this age here
[1:08:30] there is no you either going to go down
[1:08:32] or up amen there's no other messenger
[1:08:37] now sounding forth this message the
[1:08:39] seventh angel here is sounding forth his
[1:08:41] message to lay out the sin Church now
[1:08:43] this type notice his type of message now
[1:08:46] it wasn't to the first angel wasn't
[1:08:48] given that second third fourth fifth
[1:08:49] sixth but it is the seventh angel they
[1:08:52] had this type of message what was it
[1:08:54] notice his type of message finishing all
[1:08:57] the mysteries of God that are written in
[1:08:58] the book the seventh angel is winding up
[1:09:01] all the mysteries that's laying loose
[1:09:03] ended all out there through these
[1:09:05] organizations and denominations the
[1:09:07] seventh angel gathers them up and
[1:09:09] finishes the entire mystery that's what
[1:09:12] the Bible said finish the mystery of the
[1:09:14] written book now let's note a few of
[1:09:17] these mysteries if you want to write
[1:09:18] them down first these talks about dr.
[1:09:20] Scofield he goes back to Matthew 13 and
[1:09:22] he answered and said unto them because
[1:09:24] it's given to you disciples because it's
[1:09:26] given to you to know the mysteries of
[1:09:27] the kingdom of heaven but not to them
[1:09:30] but to them not to them it's not to them
[1:09:32] these and them that is not given now
[1:09:34] watch brother Branham the mystery here
[1:09:37] is the mystery a mystery of Scripture is
[1:09:40] a previous
[1:09:42] we hidden truth now divinely revealed
[1:09:45] but but which is a supernatural element
[1:09:50] still remaining to spot the revelation
[1:09:54] amen the revelation of the church ages
[1:09:56] they had a revelation but there was a
[1:09:59] supernatural element that was what
[1:10:01] sealed up to the time of the end
[1:10:06] he told Daniel he said sealing up to the
[1:10:08] time of the end people go to and fro
[1:10:11] knowledge will increase but there'll be
[1:10:12] one group of people that will catch this
[1:10:14] and manage that alright alright number
[1:10:17] five now we turn quickly because I know
[1:10:21] there's a baptism service what is this
[1:10:23] seventh seal book or what a great thing
[1:10:25] did you notice how it says here it was
[1:10:27] seven seals on the back of the book it's
[1:10:29] something oh may God help us now and
[1:10:31] give us courage and maybe sooner or
[1:10:32] later I can get to you look this is not
[1:10:35] written in the word it's sealed on the
[1:10:37] back of the word the book was sealed by
[1:10:40] these seven seals the whole mystery of
[1:10:42] the book is sealed up in these seven
[1:10:45] seals this is one of the most greatest
[1:10:47] chapters in the whole book of the
[1:10:49] revelation now remember what is that
[1:10:50] Revelation chapter five because they
[1:10:52] said right here and I saw the right hand
[1:10:54] of him that sat on the throne a book
[1:10:55] written within and written within
[1:10:57] insides written that's what we're
[1:10:58] reading this morning and on the backside
[1:11:00] sealed with seven seals now listen
[1:11:02] people there's not 14 seals I didn't
[1:11:03] told you that Wednesday night there's
[1:11:05] not 14 seals there's only seven seals
[1:11:07] all right breaks all your type of fish
[1:11:09] 14 there's seven seals
[1:11:11] all right but there's mysteries under
[1:11:13] those seven seals it's not just what
[1:11:15] that is cuz I'll show you in a minute
[1:11:17] like we're doing Wednesday night outside
[1:11:19] the Bible what the Bible doesn't even
[1:11:21] say it's sealed in here with seven seals
[1:11:24] the mysteries of God now what is it now
[1:11:27] notice a seal represents a finished
[1:11:29] product something that's been already
[1:11:32] tested proven and then sealed whereas we
[1:11:36] have the earnest of our salvation now by
[1:11:38] being sealed with the Holy Spirit now
[1:11:40] this is the earnest that is the earnest
[1:11:44] of our salvation because listen true
[1:11:47] salvation true redemption the end of all
[1:11:51] Redemption is we're standing on the
[1:11:54] earth in a glorified body
[1:11:56] you can say I've been born again when
[1:12:00] you're standing in a glorified body
[1:12:02] hey man cuz right now I'm only boarding
[1:12:08] into my soul
[1:12:09] you're only born again in your soul
[1:12:11] those that are in the sixth dimension
[1:12:13] they're going to get in their soul but
[1:12:15] their bodies laying rotting in the
[1:12:16] ground a man that's not complete that's
[1:12:20] not complete redemption that all right
[1:12:26] now let's read right here number six and
[1:12:28] then we'll give an example we might stop
[1:12:31] right here and then we'll carry on next
[1:12:34] Sunday that's okay Gables instructions
[1:12:36] that Daniel 1961 we find out
[1:12:39] I remember the seals hadn't broke at
[1:12:41] this time we find out that this was
[1:12:43] sealed with seven seals sealed with
[1:12:47] seven seals and each seal was wrapped
[1:12:50] around look whatever each seal was
[1:12:53] wrapped around and as the revelation
[1:12:56] come forth he pulled the seal and undone
[1:12:59] this and read what the seal said then he
[1:13:06] undid the next one read once the seal
[1:13:07] set undone the next one pulling out see
[1:13:09] what that seal said what the revelation
[1:13:12] was that's exactly what our seven seals
[1:13:15] that we're going into shortly we trust
[1:13:17] that we'll do eat seal when it took off
[1:13:20] the book will be unrolled and that shows
[1:13:23] exactly what taken place that all right
[1:13:27] say ma'am now let's go to the next quote
[1:13:31] because I want you want to read this and
[1:13:33] then we'll go back to this skip that one
[1:13:35] cuz we read it Wednesday night cuz
[1:13:39] remember let's not go back to Esther
[1:13:41] let's wait let's no let's no bypass the
[1:13:43] Word of God right here also for the Jews
[1:13:46] and book of Esther as is liking you in
[1:13:48] the King's name and seal it with the
[1:13:49] king's ring now for the writing which
[1:13:53] was written in the King's name and
[1:13:55] sealed with the King dream may no man
[1:13:57] reverse you remember what happened the
[1:14:00] king wrote a decree that the Jews were
[1:14:03] to be killed right then Esther goes back
[1:14:06] and pleads with him and he says okay I'm
[1:14:08] gonna
[1:14:09] an opportunity to defend themselves
[1:14:12] because you can't reverse once the king
[1:14:15] says something same thing with the Word
[1:14:17] of God you can't reverse what God said
[1:14:19] God can't reverse what God said so it
[1:14:22] was sealed but now remember what was the
[1:14:25] most important part of that the seal or
[1:14:30] what was written inside the seal was
[1:14:33] just what making sure no one saw it but
[1:14:36] the people that was supposed to see it
[1:14:39] you and I it was sealed but what was
[1:14:43] written on the inside was the important
[1:14:46] part
[1:14:47] these are quotes I scribbled on a piece
[1:14:50] of paper wins you now but I got some
[1:14:51] quotes now that's the same thing with
[1:14:55] the boxcar folks I'm telling you the
[1:14:58] boxcar the seal is important it keeps
[1:15:03] you from somebody from breaking in it
[1:15:06] keeps somebody from taking what you got
[1:15:08] but that seal was not the most valuable
[1:15:11] thing it was what was inside that boxes
[1:15:15] what was valuable it's what's inside the
[1:15:20] boxes what was valuable it's what was
[1:15:22] inside when the seal broke sure that's
[1:15:26] valuable but that's the wild horse
[1:15:28] riders Antichrist it's not this that's
[1:15:33] the wild horse riders Antichrist you
[1:15:35] said I'll prove it to me oh I believe I
[1:15:37] will number seven the breach between the
[1:15:41] church ages in the seals now notice the
[1:15:43] seven seals holds the mystery of the
[1:15:45] book until we can see see see what those
[1:15:50] seven seals has sealed in
[1:15:54] we're only presuming these things now
[1:15:58] let's go and go down to 49 notice seven
[1:16:02] seals on the book has the those seven
[1:16:05] seals has the book sealed see the book
[1:16:11] is absolutely sealed the book is
[1:16:13] absolutely sealed amen do you see it the
[1:16:20] book is absolutely a sealed
[1:16:22] book until the seven seals
[1:16:26] is broke it's sealed up with seven seals
[1:16:31] now that's different from the seventh
[1:16:34] under seal a that's different there's
[1:16:36] two things we're working on here this is
[1:16:39] the seven seals on the book but it's not
[1:16:46] the book it's not the book the problem
[1:16:50] is is people going well the wild horse
[1:16:51] riders han across and they went with
[1:16:53] that seal because remember here stands
[1:16:56] the land with the book is hand and there
[1:16:57] goes a wild horse rider there goes there
[1:16:59] goes that part of the seal and
[1:17:00] everybody's going and they're forgetting
[1:17:04] this that's been our 54 year problem
[1:17:13] knowing the wild horse rider was the
[1:17:16] Antichrist will not change your body
[1:17:19] sure it'll help you
[1:17:21] it'll line it up but right here is the
[1:17:25] Thunder there's the voice of God that's
[1:17:31] different from the seven thunders see
[1:17:33] this is the seven seals on the book now
[1:17:38] remember Wednesday night what is that
[1:17:40] book in the breach about 49 times
[1:17:43] brother Branham said book of redemption
[1:17:47] not book of the devil I'm not worried
[1:17:51] about him once the seal breaks I'm not
[1:17:56] brother Bram said that's why I'm not the
[1:17:58] son of Charles in a libretto he knew
[1:18:00] that seal was broke and he had to
[1:18:02] Thunder which was a revelations what
[1:18:05] contained in in the seven seals the
[1:18:10] other I don't mean to holler at you I
[1:18:11] just told you I'm just happy cuz we got
[1:18:16] all the you know really I mean we got
[1:18:17] people in the message that are stuck
[1:18:19] right here
[1:18:22] listen Clarence working under this right
[1:18:25] here I know you're gonna hate me now
[1:18:27] Clarence Larkin musta got something from
[1:18:29] God that that sale was Antichrist but
[1:18:33] the problem with Clarence Larkin was he
[1:18:35] didn't have a met
[1:18:36] she's behind it listen God reveals
[1:18:39] things to people come brother Bram
[1:18:41] didn't bring out lo Goss and all that
[1:18:43] Scofield had that in his Bible already
[1:18:45] before brother Branham got here
[1:18:47] but why did it take it took a prophet
[1:18:50] with a message behind it to take those
[1:18:52] seals break them off and then what have
[1:18:55] a message I mean you know we thought
[1:18:59] well Clarence Larkin was just the
[1:19:01] denominational person well you know what
[1:19:02] so was so was the Pentecostal Oral
[1:19:10] Roberts he didn't accept the message
[1:19:13] brother Branham called him a prophet
[1:19:15] Billy Graham he said brother Graham had
[1:19:18] to hold go
[1:19:19] they didn't have the message he now the
[1:19:22] message behind it
[1:19:23] hey aff Bosworth the old oak tree never
[1:19:26] truly accepted the message but don't
[1:19:30] tell me he ain't gonna be there he's
[1:19:33] gonna be there but it's gonna what take
[1:19:37] a revelation from the people that are
[1:19:39] alive to get him out of the ground hey
[1:19:43] man the seals will not be released until
[1:19:49] the message of the seventh angel so we
[1:19:52] are presuming but the genuine revelation
[1:19:55] of God will be made perfect in that
[1:19:57] sounding and vindicated truth now that's
[1:20:01] exactly what the word says the mystery
[1:20:04] should be finished at that time and the
[1:20:06] seven sealed book remember it was closed
[1:20:09] here in Revelations five and in
[1:20:12] Revelations 10 it was open now we're
[1:20:15] gonna see what the book says about how
[1:20:17] it become open and it's not made known
[1:20:19] until the lamb takes the book and breaks
[1:20:22] the seals and opens the book see the
[1:20:24] Lambs got to take the book is his right
[1:20:28] it's his book
[1:20:35] let's read one more number eight then
[1:20:38] we'll stop right here and we'll start
[1:20:39] again next week sign all right say man
[1:20:41] so y'all ready to quit them tricked you
[1:20:45] didn't breeze between two seven churches
[1:20:47] and seven seals watch and revealed as
[1:20:50] the seals well he woke some of you up
[1:20:52] and revealed as the seals break and are
[1:20:54] released to what us watch then we can
[1:20:59] see what this great plan of redemption
[1:21:03] is and when and how it's going to be
[1:21:07] done it's all hidden in this book of
[1:21:10] mystery he'll hear it sealed up with
[1:21:13] seven seals so the lamb is the only one
[1:21:17] who can break them and the whole thing
[1:21:19] here the seven seals got the mysteries
[1:21:22] of God from the foundation of the world
[1:21:24] all sealed up in there and revealed by
[1:21:28] seven different seals that if God
[1:21:31] willing let him let us pull back those
[1:21:33] seals hold on a minute now look what he
[1:21:36] said pull back the seals and look down
[1:21:39] through the book to find out what it's
[1:21:43] all about oh I hope we have a great time
[1:21:45] there the mystery of redemption is
[1:21:47] sealed until this book could not be
[1:21:50] broken until the last angels message the
[1:21:53] scrolls there we note it was there we
[1:21:58] note it was redemption we believed it
[1:22:01] was redemption so that seven sealed book
[1:22:04] is the book of redemption but it was
[1:22:06] sealed with seven seals seal number one
[1:22:16] you say what's the revelation of the
[1:22:20] first seal he said well that the
[1:22:25] Antichrist was was the the writer of the
[1:22:29] of the portion now I'll bring you quote
[1:22:33] next Sunday I didn't want to bring you
[1:22:34] this Sunday we're brother Branham says
[1:22:35] my revelation of this seal is that
[1:22:38] Christ the lamb and the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:41] the self same person so don't tell me
[1:22:45] that's just a seal and that's it
[1:22:46] don't tell me the revelation no
[1:22:49] when that broke you know who had it
[1:22:52] sealed up that guy that guy written the
[1:22:56] stent was on the horse that's the one
[1:22:59] that had it sealed up God never wanted
[1:23:02] to seal anything up he wants to reveal
[1:23:04] Satan's sealed it he's the one who just
[1:23:07] put the seal satai you can't understand
[1:23:08] that I'm the Holy Ghost I'm riding
[1:23:14] through the churches I'm the Holy Ghost
[1:23:15] when all over all the time what he was
[1:23:18] you doing was he was sealing everything
[1:23:21] up because remember God wants to break
[1:23:24] them
[1:23:25] God don't want don't think he wants to
[1:23:27] seal is me and you grieve not the Holy
[1:23:31] Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:23:35] until the day of your redemption let's
[1:23:37] stand to our feet brother branham
[1:23:38] brought us a wonderful message and then
[1:23:43] he's off the scene now and it's gonna
[1:23:47] taste the Bible says what the the
[1:23:52] ignorance of preaching cuz I want to ask
[1:23:58] you a question and I ain't gonna be
[1:24:00] big-headed about it and I'm like brother
[1:24:01] Dale I don't really care what anybody
[1:24:02] thinks about me I really don't just want
[1:24:05] God thinks about me who have you heard
[1:24:08] preached that the seals was everything
[1:24:10] I've heard he preached a thousand times
[1:24:13] that the seal the boy that white horse
[1:24:15] riders Antichrist and that's this
[1:24:16] revelation of the seal no that ain't the
[1:24:20] whole thing there's a mystery lying
[1:24:24] underneath there that you and I have not
[1:24:26] been able to see until now so the seven
[1:24:35] seals are not the seven thunders but
[1:24:38] without the seven seals break you're not
[1:24:40] gonna see the seven thunders and the
[1:24:42] seven thunders is not some other
[1:24:43] something because they got it right here
[1:24:46] let me read this so they don't have this
[1:24:48] quote this day the scriptures reveal
[1:24:50] watch this I want you to listen to
[1:24:52] something you remember when brother
[1:24:54] Branham jr. Jackson had the dream of the
[1:24:57] pyramid everybody familiar with that say
[1:25:00] Amen right Amen all right so what
[1:25:02] was that pyramid alright watch what
[1:25:05] happened called the Holy Spirit revealed
[1:25:08] it brother branham in this stage of
[1:25:10] Scripture fulfilled to nineteen 1965 and
[1:25:13] I stood there a little bit and I'm gonna
[1:25:15] read this next Sunday so you don't have
[1:25:16] to pull it up in the back and I stood
[1:25:18] there a little bit till the Holy Spirit
[1:25:20] revealed it and I said the entire Bible
[1:25:23] as much has been revealed to man through
[1:25:25] justification state fication baptism of
[1:25:27] Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name the
[1:25:29] faith of the fathers and all these
[1:25:32] things has been revealed but there is
[1:25:35] secrets that's hid inside because the
[1:25:38] Bible is sealed with seven seals I must
[1:25:42] go there to find him remember what jr.
[1:25:45] Jackson said he saw brother Brad what
[1:25:47] whipped the top off of the pyramid look
[1:25:52] down in the pyramid and said lot had
[1:25:55] never shined on what was down there
[1:25:57] there's your thunders there's your
[1:26:01] thunder lot had never shined on that but
[1:26:04] you know what it wasn't written in some
[1:26:07] mysterious writing it always was there
[1:26:11] it just took somebody to rip the top off
[1:26:14] and be able to have enough revelation
[1:26:17] listen and I don't mean nothing about
[1:26:20] junior Jackson this is not a dish at him
[1:26:22] he was standing down here and brother
[1:26:26] Branham was right here yeah he was the
[1:26:28] only one that could reach the top and
[1:26:30] rip it off member junior Jackson was
[1:26:32] looking up I'm not saying the
[1:26:35] interaction didn't have the faith of the
[1:26:37] fathers I'm just telling you he wasn't
[1:26:38] in the position that brother Branham was
[1:26:41] when brother Branham his position was he
[1:26:44] was up there at the top where he could
[1:26:46] rip the top off of that pyramid listen a
[1:26:49] novice cannot understand I'm telling you
[1:26:53] I told him this morning there's footmen
[1:26:57] and horsemen the Bible says how you
[1:27:00] gonna how you gonna keep up if you get
[1:27:04] on if somebody is the horsemen are
[1:27:05] taking off the footman has led the
[1:27:08] battle for a long time but the horsemen
[1:27:11] the Calvary is fixing to come and when
[1:27:13] they do they're gonna pass right by
[1:27:16] the footman and what are we gonna do if
[1:27:19] we're not the horsemen we're gonna get
[1:27:26] left behind but we don't have to we need
