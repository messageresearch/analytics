[0:10] okay okay
[0:35] Jesus
[1:17] I'm going to play games
[1:36] I love you
[1:56] every other reality is Joy
[2:00] take your life
[2:11] please
[2:25] I'd love
[2:30] and I live my home so heavily
[2:36] two words
[2:54] in what you do
[3:00] make often one to another in a book of
[3:02] remembrance with written
[3:05] in your dreams
[3:13] glad to have everybody with us come to
[3:15] Fellowship together we pray you'll just
[3:17] make yourself to home and so that's
[3:20] where you ought to be that's the way
[3:22] they say that in Tennessee it sounds
[3:23] kind of funny I said make yourself to
[3:25] home where you ought to be
[3:28] it sounds like they're saying you ought
[3:31] to go home but it doesn't mean that that
[3:33] way to them it means to make yourself at
[3:36] home like you would be at home see the
[3:39] way it ought to be amen or something
[3:40] just make our Point amen it's good to be
[3:43] here and good to have a good time in the
[3:45] lord always looking forward to the
[3:47] fellowship time and to know that the
[3:49] lord loves each and every one of us and
[3:51] keeps and takes care of us right Amen
[3:53] brother Tom come on and get started and
[3:56] bring your fingers on and worship and
[3:59] let's get just have a good time in him
[4:01] amen
[4:03] amen
[4:04] remember God bless you all
[4:07] it's good to be back in the house of the
[4:09] Lord today it's good to see everybody
[4:10] here I believe that Jesus deserves all
[4:13] of our praise and all of her glory that
[4:15] we can give them and we can never Praise
[4:16] Him and worship them enough
[4:18] amen this last year has been a wonderful
[4:20] year for me
[4:21] I broke my arm I I sprained my ankle I
[4:25] had a daughter who was sick I had a
[4:28] brother who died and through it all I
[4:30] can say that Jesus Christ was very
[4:32] faithful to me
[4:34] and I've never experienced such bad
[4:36] things and felt so good about it
[4:38] and uh it is because God promised that
[4:40] he would take care of us he wouldn't
[4:42] bring us through things we could not
[4:43] bear I
[4:46] seems like I learned the message new
[4:48] each week because it's a continual
[4:50] unfolding of more and more truth from
[4:53] God's holy word in it you know we go
[4:55] through stages in the message and I
[4:57] think about that before special meeting
[4:58] before a speaker comes out and maybe at
[5:01] first we can get a little legalistic
[5:03] maybe a little bit later a little bit
[5:04] too much grace and a little later we
[5:06] float up way into the too much
[5:08] Revelation then you kind of float back
[5:10] down to reality you know but these are
[5:12] all things if we're faithful to God
[5:15] he'll guide us through every bit of it
[5:16] because he wants a well-rounded
[5:18] Christian that can make it I went
[5:21] through stages in my life where I
[5:22] thought everybody outside of this
[5:24] message of the hour who believed in the
[5:25] teachings of brother Branham was false
[5:27] wrong Serpentine going to hell and I
[5:29] have learned it's not that way at all
[5:31] there's some very very good people who
[5:33] love God very very much
[5:34] and I've come to see them now as my
[5:37] brothers and sisters
[5:39] who weren't
[5:40] so the word lucky is just not going to
[5:43] do it they just fortunate to see this
[5:46] word because this word has separated us
[5:48] from a lot of things separated us from a
[5:50] lot of hurt from a lot of different
[5:52] people and denominations it's there are
[5:55] brothers and sisters who uh we are to
[5:57] try to take care of now as as they push
[5:59] the gospel forward to our age now I
[6:01] believe it's our turn to to help pull
[6:03] them forward to this age amen and it's
[6:06] it's a hard transition from one age to
[6:08] the next and I've learned that this
[6:10] message wasn't just to save me it was to
[6:13] position me so that I could do something
[6:14] for somebody else and if you want to be
[6:17] happy in this message live this message
[6:20] for somebody else do something that
[6:23] somebody else might get a closer walk
[6:25] with the Lord Jesus Christ then we're
[6:27] representing the message correctly the
[6:30] last thing brother Branham would have
[6:31] wanted was people to to to misrepresent
[6:34] the Gospel of Jesus Christ and so he God
[6:37] gave through him a clear word that
[6:39] people could see the the very Throne of
[6:42] our Lord Jesus clearly and know what
[6:44] needs to be done to in order to get
[6:46] there know what happened in the past and
[6:48] what's going to happen in the future we
[6:50] know what's happening right now
[6:52] shouldn't be any surprise anything on on
[6:55] politics and education on new diseases
[6:58] new Wars it's it's the same old story
[7:01] just different names and so we're
[7:03] prepared people and when we hear the
[7:05] word we hear it from a different view I
[7:07] remember one time I used to buy and sell
[7:09] antiques a lot and I went to this house
[7:11] and bought a lot of stuff from these
[7:13] kind kind people and they said well we
[7:15] have a vase it's up in the attic and I
[7:18] looked for that vase for three four
[7:19] hours one time and I come back again
[7:21] another time and I said can I look in
[7:23] the Attic yeah it's there I could never
[7:25] find that vase and one time I prayed
[7:27] about it and then I went to the little
[7:29] ladies and I said can I try one more
[7:31] time they says you've looked and looked
[7:32] you can't find it
[7:34] they says if you find it you can buy it
[7:37] and what I learned when I went up into
[7:39] that attic I finally went into the attic
[7:41] not as a six foot tall person but I
[7:43] become their height
[7:45] I didn't look at it through my view I've
[7:47] tried to look at it through their View
[7:48] and I said well big tall guy like me is
[7:50] not going to go way over here in this
[7:52] corner and look and he's not going to go
[7:54] over and I'm getting into a position
[7:56] from where they were looking at things
[7:58] and I looked and I didn't just see the
[8:00] one face there was four big vases
[8:02] and I said this is a good thing and I
[8:06] said and I made a lot of money out of
[8:07] them faces but I said that to say this
[8:10] we have to come into a position
[8:13] to see the word in the way the word was
[8:16] written we can't look at it through our
[8:18] own intellect through our own
[8:20] understanding we must humble ourselves
[8:22] down into the very anointing that the
[8:25] word was written by then the message of
[8:28] this hour just like the message of
[8:30] Paul's or for those folks becomes plain
[8:33] to us and when it becomes plain it
[8:35] becomes more than possible to live you
[8:37] become desperate to live it ah I am a
[8:39] I'm a Jesus freak I guess you'd call it
[8:42] I I can't get enough of the Bible now I
[8:44] I can't get enough of this truth I can't
[8:46] get enough of the people of God in this
[8:48] message so it's not time for us to
[8:52] bewail the challenges because we know
[8:54] that's what's shaping us it's building
[8:56] our character it's not time for us to
[8:57] say oh no the financial situation in the
[9:00] United States is going to crumble if it
[9:02] wouldn't crumble we'd have a false
[9:03] message
[9:04] everything that's happening is perfectly
[9:07] in line with what's been prophesied both
[9:09] in the Bible and in this end time
[9:11] message so it's all going along
[9:13] perfectly my goodness we can't hardly
[9:15] eat a meal without it causing cancer or
[9:17] or trouble just like what was said we
[9:20] are suffering a physical corruption in
[9:22] the natural types of spiritual in the
[9:24] world around us spiritually is being
[9:26] corrupted and out of that corruption
[9:28] should walk a people who have heard the
[9:30] voice of God for this day amen who heard
[9:33] God's microphone that they might meet
[9:35] the one the King of Kings and the Lord
[9:38] of lords amen so I'm glad to be part of
[9:40] that
[9:42] amen
[9:44] and I'm glad that God's still a Healer
[9:46] and that God brings us through
[9:48] things when people pass away and when
[9:51] people get hurt and this whole body is
[9:53] getting older but no I'm not going to
[9:54] give up basketball yet I'm not going to
[9:56] give up Sports yet I'm not I've got
[9:58] young boys they need to see their dad
[10:00] out there we've got something to do
[10:03] Brothers we've got a position to hold be
[10:06] a dad to your children you want to win
[10:07] them to the message be a father to them
[10:10] mothers you want them in the message or
[10:12] do you want them to split by the time
[10:13] they're 18. live the message in front of
[10:15] them this thing must be seen it must be
[10:18] heard it must be lived before him and
[10:20] God help us when we make mistakes make
[10:22] sure they see you repent
[10:25] but I can go on and on I just love the
[10:27] Lord with all my heart I really
[10:28] appreciate brother Samuel Dale and all
[10:30] the brothers and I just consider myself
[10:32] very fortunate to even being part of
[10:34] this and I say God bless the King of
[10:36] Kings our lord Jesus I guess my girls
[10:38] have a song and brother Bradley come on
[10:41] up

[11:50] empty and broken
[11:54] I came back to him
[12:00] a vessel unworthy
[12:05] so scarred from sin but he did not
[12:14] despair he started over
[12:19] again
[12:22] and I Bless The Day He Didn't Throw the
[12:30] Clay Away

[13:29] image
[14:12] into his likeness

[16:25] also
[16:27] we lost a very dear sister
[16:32] is listening he didn't call me back
[16:36] then um sister Gladys has been here
[16:39] several times with us and
[16:42] the Lord took her home

[16:49] she led her life very faithful sister
[16:53] at a job
[16:55] she was working she did the first job
[16:58] and she had a part-time job
[17:00] so she moved to the second one
[17:04] and then

[18:23] I believe you can climb up the tree of
[18:27] science
[18:29] until you get to the end of it
[18:33] then you step over on the tree of faith
[18:39] and just keep on climbing
[18:46] I said because I believe in climbing up
[18:50] the tree
[18:51] and I believe that's what the sister
[18:52] actually believes we have to do
[18:56] we have to get on the tree of faith amen
[18:59] right it's an unlimited tree and keep
[19:03] climbing

[19:14] what is the Christian armor it says love
[19:18] joy peace Faith long-suffering meekness
[19:22] gentleness
[19:24] patience Holy Spirit

[27:00] my family two of them's done crossed

[51:47] take up the offering now the offering
[51:50] tonight most of you have heard that the
[51:53] brother be taken care of by the church
[51:54] but most of you have heard that brother
[51:57] Rocky from the Philippines passed away
[52:00] the other day and some of you saying
[52:04] that you didn't maybe you didn't know
[52:05] but you know they were trying to get
[52:08] money up to send over to him and brother
[52:10] Dutch had already sent some trying to
[52:13] get to where that he could take some
[52:15] treatments but he refused to even take
[52:17] the treatments he had liver cancer
[52:20] he refused to take the treatments he
[52:22] wouldn't even do it he let him put had
[52:24] him to put the money into the missionary
[52:26] fund and he wouldn't have the treatments
[52:29] to be done but he passed away the other
[52:30] day and we've all I know have and we
[52:33] have we've done sent some but the
[52:36] offering tonight will go to the family
[52:39] there a brother Rocky I cannot pronounce
[52:42] his last name but he's to me he was the
[52:45] biggest one of the Philippine guys you
[52:47] go over there and everybody's short and
[52:48] he at least stood up above and he was
[52:50] wonderful brother and I really
[52:52] appreciate him so what we're going to do
[52:53] is just let the offer in tonight
[52:55] go to you know to the brother's family
[53:00] to be able to uh help a little bit in
[53:03] their burial expenses into different
[53:05] things so if you have anything if you
[53:07] want to give if you come brother Kylie
[53:09] would you come and receive the offering
[53:18] who will make sure that it gets to the
[53:20] family and everything
[53:22] go ahead
[53:26] Heavenly Father we are grateful thank
[53:29] you
[53:46] Philippines
[53:52] so I'll be knowing that you are able
[53:54] Lord
[53:57] in this day Lord we asked you that as we
[54:00] grow strong what
[54:02] but we always have you
[54:04] guys
[54:16] coming true
[54:42] steps
[55:22] foreign
[56:01] amen
[56:07] this is the one way that I believe
[56:09] why would you invite a minister to come
[56:11] and preach
[56:13] if you didn't believe he was going to
[56:14] bring the word of the Lord
[56:19] that's the way I think
[56:22] you know there would be no need of
[56:23] gathering
[56:24] there'd be no need of coming together
[56:26] and and all if we were just gonna not
[56:29] believe that the finality of it all the
[56:31] fellowship is wonderful we love it
[56:34] but to hear the word of the Lord
[56:36] and see I believe the way that God will
[56:39] speak tonight to us is through our
[56:41] brother
[56:42] because he's been chosen for the part
[56:44] and God will use him the gift will be
[56:46] there
[56:47] so then that's what we ought to think
[56:49] about it right
[56:50] that God will speak to us tonight
[56:52] through our brother glad to have brother
[56:54] Jonathan Jones with us
[56:57] I love you don't maybe know him he was
[57:00] brother Jimmy Gibson's son-in-law so
[57:03] let's make it to where you'll you kind
[57:04] of get connections back together you
[57:06] should have seen that when sister came
[57:08] up and sing you know and all that we
[57:11] really appreciate old brother Jimmy I
[57:12] really really loved him he was a
[57:14] wonderful brother
[57:15] he was a great guy and I just appreciate
[57:18] him we'll meet on the other side but
[57:20] this let's just sing Open the Eyes of My
[57:23] Heart as brother Jonathan Jones comes to
[57:25] speak the word of the Lord unto us this
[57:27] night right
[57:28] oh
