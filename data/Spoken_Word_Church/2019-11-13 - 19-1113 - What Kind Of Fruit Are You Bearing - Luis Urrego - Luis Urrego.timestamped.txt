[1:15] you all along this evening and then I
[1:17] know it's it's getting dark now soon
[1:19] it's already dark out there and it's
[1:21] very cold out there so we want to go
[1:24] ahead and go to the word and in John
[1:26] chapter 15 let's go to John chapter 15
[1:38] John 15 started at verse one Bible says
[1:41] I am The True Vine and my father is the
[1:44] husbandman
[1:45] every branch in me that beareth NOT
[1:48] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[1:51] that beareth fruit he purges it that it
[1:54] may bring more fruit
[1:56] now now you are clean through the word
[1:59] which I have spoken unto you abide in me
[2:03] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[2:06] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[2:10] vine no more can ye except ye abide in
[2:14] me I am the vine ye are the branches he
[2:18] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[2:23] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[2:27] ye can do nothing if a man abide not in
[2:31] me he is cast forth as a branch and
[2:34] there's withered and men gather them and
[2:37] cast them into the fire and they are
[2:39] burned if ye abide in me and my words
[2:43] abide in you ye shall ask what ye will
[2:47] and it shall be done unto you
[2:50] amen herein is my father glorified that
[2:54] ye bear much fruit you want to know how
[2:56] to glorify the Father that's how the
[2:59] father is glorified when you're bearing
[3:01] fruit by the word that you're receiving
[3:03] amen the father is being glorified
[3:05] praise the Lord so shall ye be my
[3:08] disciples and let's just skip down to
[3:11] verse 16 it says you have not chosen me
[3:13] but I have chosen you and ordained you
[3:17] that ye should go and bring forth fruit
[3:20] and that your fruit should remain that
[3:24] whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in
[3:26] my name he may give it you Amen Lord I'd
[3:31] a blessing through the word let's just
[3:32] go ahead and have a word of Prayer our
[3:34] Heavenly Father we we thank you lord
[3:37] once again for the opportunity to come
[3:38] to church lord thank you Father God for
[3:41] know we know father God that you said
[3:44] where there's two or three gathered in
[3:45] your name you
[3:46] said you said that there would be you
[3:48] would be in their mist and we believed
[3:50] that tonight we're claiming it father
[3:51] God so father God speak to us through
[3:53] your word because father God you said in
[3:56] your word father God that your word is
[3:58] spirit in life Lord and Lord God let
[4:00] your life father God just shine upon us
[4:02] Lord and and Lord changes from the
[4:04] inside out Lord God Almighty revealed to
[4:07] us your word Lord God so that we can go
[4:09] live your word Lord help us father god
[4:11] bless your people now and meet every
[4:14] need that's amongst us and every request
[4:15] that was made Lord God may you meet
[4:17] these needs father God we commit
[4:19] ourselves now into your hands and we
[4:22] pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[4:24] and man you may be seated Saints praise
[4:28] the Lord amen I just want to give a
[4:31] little title tonight maybe we would do a
[4:33] little study tonight maybe I'll call it
[4:35] what kind of fruit are you bearing what
[4:38] kind of fruit are you bearing in you
[4:40] know this scripture here in John chapter
[4:41] 15 is a it's one of my favorite
[4:45] scriptures and really this stems a lot
[4:50] from like the last time when we had the
[4:52] the last youth service the last Youth
[4:55] Saturday service because to me when when
[4:59] this particular scripture is one of the
[5:01] scriptures that helped me understand the
[5:04] new birth and and and and so one of one
[5:10] of several but I want to try to see if
[5:13] maybe this evening if maybe we can kind
[5:14] of maybe simplify a little bit a little
[5:17] bit if we can you know and and just try
[5:21] to see what we'll see what the Lord does
[5:24] amen to find out exactly Saints because
[5:27] we have to remember that whatever a tree
[5:29] out here is meant to give fruit you know
[5:34] there's a fruit that it's supposed to
[5:35] give right and whatever fruit it's
[5:38] supposed to give if the tree of this oak
[5:40] tree out here is given forth some
[5:42] oranges or a pecan tree is given forth
[5:45] oranges something is wrong right
[5:48] something something something's not
[5:49] right something something's crossed
[5:51] something that something's not right you
[5:53] see and so therefore when we are
[5:55] supposed to be meant
[5:57] amen full of the Word of God living
[5:59] through us amens in an abiding in us
[6:03] amen and if we're given something
[6:05] different contrary to the word then
[6:08] something must be wrong something that
[6:10] something is not right in our life amen
[6:12] praise the Lord Jesus so by the help of
[6:16] the Lord Amen let's just see where the
[6:17] Lord leads us tonight so in Jesus Christ
[6:20] said in in in John chapter 15 and verse
[6:23] 1 there it says I am The True Vine and
[6:25] my father is the husband man now I like
[6:28] the way he words it there because he is
[6:30] the True Vine that's the reason why he
[6:32] said I am the way the truth and the life
[6:36] amen that no man can come to the Father
[6:38] except by me except by him right
[6:42] praise the Lord he's the only one that
[6:44] he can say I am thee and be correct
[6:47] praise God but it's in this last day
[6:49] Amen when you and I began to say I am my
[6:52] father are one
[6:53] I am the Bride of Christ I am God amen
[6:57] in flesh today amen people don't like to
[7:01] hear that amen you'll get persecuted for
[7:04] sure I am The True Vine my and my and my
[7:10] father is the husbandman praise the Lord
[7:12] Jesus and so there if you read in John
[7:15] chapter 14 verses 5 through 7 the Bible
[7:18] says there Thomas saith unto Him Lord we
[7:21] know whither thou goest and how can we
[7:23] know the way jesus saith unto him I am
[7:26] the way the truth and the life no man
[7:29] cometh unto the father but by me so
[7:32] there's no salvation in any other except
[7:34] Jesus Christ there is no salvation than
[7:36] in any man there's no salvation and in
[7:39] what you can do you can do nothing to
[7:42] save yourself and that's the reason why
[7:45] it has helped me and I hope it helps you
[7:48] sings a mint that sometimes we we feel
[7:50] so condemned when we may be done wrong
[7:53] and I hope this helps our younger people
[7:56] maybe sometimes we did something wrong
[7:58] we've done something and you know what
[8:00] you if you just get to the mindset and
[8:02] say lord I can't save myself there's
[8:06] nothing I can do to take this sin off of
[8:09] my off of my life
[8:10] done it I confessed it and you Lord you
[8:13] already did it for me so now you take
[8:15] care of the rest they meant and when you
[8:17] take God that way amen God will be able
[8:19] to do more things for you than what you
[8:21] can imagine he'll take care of that sin
[8:24] because why you believed his word you
[8:26] believed what he did for you amen and
[8:29] then the rest of it is in his hands
[8:31] praise the Lord amen so that that's how
[8:34] God wants us to to approach him so
[8:38] simply you know sometimes we think that
[8:40] we just need to be crawling on our knees
[8:42] for fifteen hours or or doing some sort
[8:44] of petting and penitence or or something
[8:47] but saying it's just as simple as taking
[8:49] God Lord you said it you did it
[8:51] you said it I believe it I'm confessing
[8:54] it to you and the Lord says I like to
[8:56] hear my word back at me so let me just
[8:59] go ahead and apply what my breath my son
[9:01] or my daughter's request an amen
[9:03] praise God that's how you have to do
[9:05] that's as simple as that praise God if
[9:08] he had known me then and continuing
[9:11] there in John 14 if he had known me
[9:13] Jesus speaking you should have known my
[9:14] father also and from henceforth you know
[9:17] him and have seen him
[9:19] Amen because jesus said if you have seen
[9:22] me you've seen the father there was no
[9:25] difference in between em it was just
[9:26] that he was being manifested in flesh at
[9:28] that time you see praise the Lord Amen
[9:31] so now if if we read here in the next
[9:35] verse there in in John chapter 15 and
[9:38] verse 2 it says every branch in me that
[9:40] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away you see
[9:45] so if there's a I mean if you gardeners
[9:49] or in you any of you that deal with
[9:51] horticulture you know if there's if you
[9:54] plant something you meant for it to give
[9:56] forth a certain fruit an apple tree and
[9:58] if it's not given anything you know it's
[10:02] just in the way you know it's dead
[10:05] something's wrong right and so that's
[10:07] the same thing here you're gonna do
[10:09] something about it you're gonna cut it
[10:10] away you're gonna do you're gonna take
[10:12] it away and that's what jesus said here
[10:14] every branch in me that beareth NOT
[10:15] fruit he taketh away there is going to
[10:18] be people in this life they're not gonna
[10:20] bury any fruit whatsoever
[10:22] they're not gonna they're not going to
[10:25] bear they're not going to bear anything
[10:27] they were they were put in this life
[10:30] amen
[10:31] for that purpose amen praise God
[10:34] but you and I Saints if the Word of God
[10:36] has come to us amen and has in his
[10:39] abiding in us we're supposed to give off
[10:42] fruit an abundant fruit and let me tell
[10:45] you what Saints that fruit is not for
[10:47] you to enjoy because a tree out here an
[10:51] apple tree out here doesn't give fruit
[10:53] for him itself to eat that of that fruit
[10:56] neither there's an orange eat of its own
[10:58] fruit that fruit that you and I give is
[11:03] for each other to eat enjoy the fruit
[11:06] that brother Wade gives off a man is for
[11:08] me to enjoy the fruit that brother Dale
[11:09] gives off is for me to enjoy the brother
[11:11] Marcus other brother Boyd is for us to
[11:14] enjoy one another amen it's God's fruit
[11:17] amen so now we have to make sure and we
[11:21] have to look and say Lord what kind of
[11:23] fruit am i given is it positive fruit or
[11:27] is a negative fruit amen
[11:30] or no fruit at all you have no hope then
[11:36] but now we could be given negative fruit
[11:39] some sort of rotten fruit it's fruit but
[11:42] it might be rotten and I don't want to
[11:45] eat off of that you see I want something
[11:49] God who likes a good juicy nice crisp
[11:52] apple red apple or Granny Smith whatever
[11:58] amen no nothing out nothing rotten and
[12:01] then when you bite into it there's a
[12:03] worm sticking out like this and saying
[12:05] you know you don't want anything like
[12:08] that amen but sometimes saying say man
[12:12] we have to step back and take a look and
[12:13] say you know what am I just given half
[12:17] half half fruit you know half half a
[12:21] part you know how part rotten and part
[12:24] good oh well now I'm going to eat at
[12:26] Apple I won't eat the whole thing
[12:28] I want to enjoy everything that God has
[12:29] for you sir
[12:30] amen that God is working in your life
[12:32] praise the Lord
[12:34] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[12:36] purchased it that it may bring forth
[12:38] more fruit now Paul speaks of this fruit
[12:41] in in Galatians chapter 5 and the
[12:44] brothers could bring it up in Galatians
[12:46] chapter 5 verses 16 through 24 and Paul
[12:51] says here it's interesting what a
[12:53] ringlet we're gonna see if we can bring
[12:55] a couple of things from this he says
[12:57] here this I say then walk in the spirit
[13:00] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[13:03] flesh now what does it mean to walk in
[13:07] the spirit well what is the spirit amen
[13:12] the spirit is God's own life amen
[13:16] you see that's the reason why Jesus said
[13:18] if you abide in me and my spirit abides
[13:22] in you then ask what you wish amen
[13:25] so it's God's own life so if you have
[13:28] God's own life amen you should be
[13:30] walking in the spirit amen how many
[13:33] understand that is that clear so far
[13:35] man if God's Holy Spirit is abiding in
[13:39] your life then you should be walking in
[13:43] the spirit so in other words not walking
[13:46] in yourself walking in the spirit of God
[13:50] as the spirit giveth to you then you
[13:53] will be walking in that you see I meant
[13:56] because it's God's own life amen and so
[13:59] the spirit here in this verse is is God
[14:02] is God himself in John 6:63
[14:06] Jesus says it is the spirit that
[14:09] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[14:13] amen
[14:14] the words that I speak unto you they are
[14:17] spirit and they are life you see so when
[14:22] you're walking in the spirit that means
[14:25] you're walking in the word amen is it
[14:29] simple enough
[14:30] I hope this is making this little simple
[14:35] of it when you have the Holy Spirit of
[14:37] God amen
[14:38] that means you're feeding off the Word
[14:41] of God right off the life of the word
[14:44] Amen not off brother Dale or brother
[14:46] waiter
[14:47] he or any about amen we're just here a
[14:49] man just proclaiming that life
[14:52] you see but then that life Amen should
[14:56] change you from the inside out a man
[14:59] pushing out to be able to push out the
[15:01] fruit that God wants you to to Express
[15:04] you see Amen so so continuing here in
[15:08] Galatians for the flesh lusteth against
[15:10] the spirit and the spirit against the
[15:13] flesh see when you don't have that that
[15:18] struggle in your life then something is
[15:22] wrong when you're not when you're not
[15:26] struggling you're in your life a man I
[15:29] used to love this and now for some
[15:32] reason I just don't I'm struggling I
[15:35] want to do it but then I don't I wanna I
[15:38] want to get be involved with this and
[15:40] then I don't you see and then it becomes
[15:42] a struggle it becomes a and if that
[15:44] struggle is not a new Saints Amen
[15:46] then somebody you we need to repent we
[15:51] need the Holy Spirit we don't have the
[15:53] Holy Ghost amen
[15:54] because the Christian the the life of a
[15:58] Christian saints is a battle it's a
[16:02] tug-of-war a man it's like that it's
[16:05] like that that that black him that black
[16:08] and white dog that brother branham gave
[16:09] that example amen when they asked that
[16:12] Indian up in there Alaska a man who is
[16:15] it that there wins it says it's the dog
[16:17] that did I feed the most the dog that
[16:20] you feed the most or in other words the
[16:24] the man that you feed the most amen the
[16:27] the the the one that you feed the most
[16:29] the flesh or the spirit is the one
[16:32] that's going to end up winning why can I
[16:34] overcome this are you feeding that are
[16:39] you constantly I can't overcome it I
[16:42] can't overcome and then you're
[16:43] constantly born back and forth back and
[16:45] forth repenting for the same thing over
[16:47] and over and over
[16:48] amen are you feeding that because if you
[16:51] feed it then it's gonna continue to win
[16:53] right very simple concepts in the word
[16:57] he meant
[16:58] but we just want to try to keep it a
[17:01] little simplified tonight amen praise
[17:03] God so so for the flesh lusteth against
[17:09] the spirit and the spirit against the
[17:10] flesh and these are contrary the one to
[17:13] the other that's the reason why Saints
[17:16] that makes in the world with the church
[17:19] doesn't doesn't doesn't mix it's like
[17:21] oil and water
[17:23] to the world it seems okay that's why
[17:26] when you go to a church one of these
[17:28] secular churches and you see all the
[17:30] other all the lights and all the all the
[17:33] dancing and all the another it's like
[17:36] it's like a holy club supposedly oh you
[17:43] know I might as well just go back to the
[17:44] club right where I used to hang out you
[17:47] know that's the real thing this is all
[17:49] mixed you see so this stuff doesn't mix
[17:54] and these are contrary the one to the
[17:56] other so that ye cannot do the things
[17:58] that you would now verse 18 but if you'd
[18:01] be led of the Spirit you are not under
[18:04] the law now I like I like how Paul says
[18:08] that there amen and in later on in in
[18:10] the in the next few verses he'll mention
[18:12] something else regarding that but Saints
[18:15] really I was to be Catholic and I used
[18:20] to I know how it was like that you do to
[18:23] try to do works to get the favor of God
[18:25] to get the favor of the Virgin Mary and
[18:28] all those things I know about those
[18:31] things and and and so but there is once
[18:34] the Holy Spirit is living your life
[18:37] there is you there is no more law
[18:39] because Saints you become a law within
[18:41] yourself God already fulfilled the law
[18:45] for you
[18:46] you see God in in the Old Testament
[18:49] Jesus the the the Lord gave the
[18:53] Israelites the law because they wanted
[18:55] it so really in them doing that it was
[19:00] actually showing them grace but they him
[19:05] God knowing that they could not and no
[19:07] human being ever could fulfill that law
[19:10] so what happened
[19:12] Jesus Christ came and lived on earth and
[19:15] He fulfilled the law himself died on the
[19:18] cross and then came back in the form of
[19:21] the Holy Spirit and now that same spirit
[19:24] that fulfilled that that fulfilled the
[19:26] law already a man that is a law within
[19:29] that's his own law amen now he can give
[19:32] us that conquering power in you and I so
[19:36] that's the reason why Paul says here but
[19:40] if you be led of the Spirit you have
[19:42] God's own life you are not under the law
[19:46] you're not under the law of Christ
[19:49] because why he's already fulfilled it
[19:53] for you praise the Lord
[19:56] you don't have to live under the law if
[19:58] you if you let the Spirit of Christ amen
[20:01] guide your life you have to worry that I
[20:04] gotta do this I gotta do that I have to
[20:07] I have to do this that or the other no
[20:09] the Holy Spirit in you will
[20:12] automatically amen let things come out
[20:15] forth amen
[20:17] as you continue to feed on the word amen
[20:19] as you continue to feed on a drink from
[20:22] this water now the works of the flesh
[20:24] are manifest which are these adultery
[20:27] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[20:29] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[20:34] emulations wrath strife seditions
[20:36] heresies envyings murders drunkenness
[20:40] revellings and such like of the which i
[20:43] tell you before as i have also told you
[20:45] in times past that they which do such
[20:47] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[20:49] God amen
[20:50] just like in John 15:2 that we just read
[20:52] you know God will just cut them right
[20:54] off the branch amen but the fruit of the
[20:59] Spirit now watch verse 22 but the fruit
[21:00] of the Spirit you see the Spirit has
[21:04] fruit the fruit of the Spirit is love
[21:08] joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[21:12] goodness faith meekness temperance watch
[21:19] against such there is no law
[21:25] there is no law because why those things
[21:28] when the Holy Ghost is in your life amen
[21:30] those things are automatically couldn't
[21:32] be coming out of you
[21:33] amen and there's no law against that
[21:36] right in other words let's say I'm out
[21:39] here driving and there I see a sign that
[21:42] says don't drink and drive I think
[21:46] brother wait is given this this example
[21:48] before don't drink and drive well if if
[21:52] I don't drink that law doesn't apply to
[21:54] me you see and that's the same thing
[21:59] with the word Amen all these things he
[22:01] got see Paul mentioned all these things
[22:04] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[22:06] emulations wrath strife all those things
[22:08] but there here comes the luck that here
[22:11] comes the life of Christ amen
[22:14] and if the life of Christ is dwelling in
[22:17] you then none of those things have
[22:19] anything against you there's no law wait
[22:20] for the that you you have you have not
[22:24] you don't have to worry about you trying
[22:26] to live the law again because the law
[22:29] has already been fulfilled because that
[22:31] life is living in you how many
[22:33] understand amen
[22:36] the life of God living the law through
[22:40] you amen praise God living the word
[22:44] through you amen
[22:46] praise God but the fruit of spirit now
[22:50] all right so meekness temperance against
[22:52] such there is no law amen
[22:53] and they that are Christ's have
[22:55] crucified the flesh with the affections
[22:58] and lusts amen praise God so daily that
[23:05] we live Saints we have to crucify
[23:08] ourselves more and more the more we
[23:12] crucify ourselves the more we continue
[23:15] to feed off the word the more of God the
[23:19] more of the life of God should be
[23:21] reflecting in our lives and then and the
[23:23] more of the fruit that you're gonna be
[23:25] bearing God's fruit you see more of that
[23:29] fruit that you're gonna bear and so that
[23:30] I can enjoy awful amen same thing from
[23:35] you with me and you amen
[23:36] and the message that laman
[23:39] brother Branham says here and now the
[23:41] fruit of the Spirit is not joining
[23:43] church the fruit of the Spirit is not
[23:45] smoking cigarettes the fruit of the I
[23:48] mean quit smoking cigarettes the fruit
[23:51] of the Spirit is not to speak with
[23:52] tongues the fruit of the Spirit is not
[23:54] to pray for the sick and they be healed
[23:57] the fruit of the Spirit is not prophesy
[23:59] or preach but the fruit of the Spirit is
[24:01] found in Galatians 5:22 love joy peace
[24:03] goodness long-suffering faith meekness
[24:05] gentleness that's the fruit of the
[24:07] Spirit now no matter how much you preach
[24:09] you got a real LLL telll temper don't do
[24:14] you much good to preach see no matter
[24:17] how much you join church and try to
[24:18] impersonate if you're crabbing and nasty
[24:21] with your neighbor you'll never win him
[24:23] to Christ then all right see it's the
[24:30] fruit of the Spirit as my wife used to
[24:32] tell me actions speak louder than words
[24:35] that's right live me a sermon instead of
[24:38] preaching me one that's a good thing
[24:40] leave them live me a sermon amen
[24:43] god help us amen we want to live more of
[24:46] the words because Saints the word is
[24:49] it's good to another word amen but what
[24:52] is the word it what what's the use of
[24:54] knowing the word if you don't live it
[24:58] God wants us to manifest the word and
[25:01] the word amen as I've said before the
[25:04] only things that you'll take away a man
[25:06] from this life is what you do for Christ
[25:08] and what you do for others and what you
[25:11] do is living the word you see because I
[25:17] could have it here but doesn't mean I'm
[25:19] doing it
[25:20] hey man it's two different things I mean
[25:23] I want I want to do the word amen
[25:26] praise the Lord now if we continue in
[25:30] John chapter 15 and verse 2 there again
[25:37] it says there in the last part it says
[25:40] now in every branch that beareth fruit
[25:42] he purges it that it may bring forth
[25:49] more fruit
[25:51] amen now I don't know if you if any of
[25:53] you all have dealt with roses or deal
[25:57] with gardens and things like that I I
[25:59] have thing here where it says that the
[26:02] the importance of pruning roses one of
[26:08] the reasons one of the reasons that it's
[26:11] important is because it removes the dead
[26:14] and diseased branches and so roses get
[26:18] dead and diseased branches and they're
[26:21] also called canes it rejuvenates the
[26:25] plant and encourages blooming encourages
[26:29] airflow through the shrub and controls
[26:32] the size and the shape of the plant you
[26:34] see so as your as a gardener a menu you
[26:38] you're you're the husband then you know
[26:40] you're caring for your for your rose why
[26:43] because you wanted to do to to look more
[26:46] beautiful to give forth that it's
[26:48] fragrance to give forth more of what it
[26:51] was meant to give amen and therefore
[26:54] Saints God is this does the same thing
[26:57] with you and I through what through
[26:59] trials and tribulations the more mature
[27:04] of God God is going to want to make sure
[27:08] that you could give fruit at the maximum
[27:11] level God is not satisfied with 50% when
[27:14] he knows you can give a hundred and ten
[27:16] God is not satisfied with 20% when he
[27:19] knows that you can give a hundred amen
[27:21] he's gonna do everything he can to get
[27:25] you to reach that that fullness amen
[27:28] praise God and so sometimes a man he
[27:31] looks and sees Wow
[27:33] I see that for the mark I'm not saying
[27:38] that you do brother mark but for the
[27:40] mark has a long tongue I had him cut
[27:43] here a little bit coat over here all
[27:47] right now he's turned a little bit more
[27:48] sharp no but you know he he's gonna cut
[27:54] wherever and this person here you know
[27:55] too much lying in their life or or too
[27:57] much cheating too much of this that
[27:59] dieter the other Amen too many dirty
[28:01] jokes or whatever let me cut something
[28:02] in his life they men why because
[28:05] if you claim that you have the Holy
[28:06] Spirit in your life and it's God's own
[28:08] life in you and you're not manifesting
[28:10] you're manifesting rotten fruit amen
[28:12] he's gonna want to make sure that you
[28:14] continue to manifest more fruit for him
[28:16] amen
[28:18] because I cannot if I if if I am to feed
[28:22] off of you my man I can't feed off your
[28:23] dirty jokes
[28:24] I can't feed off you know the the things
[28:29] that the cheating lines stealing or
[28:31] whatever amen praise God and you can
[28:35] name it well you you you you know what
[28:38] you have struggled with each and every
[28:40] one of us has struggles in our lives you
[28:42] know your struggle and you know what to
[28:45] do amen to keep that covered amen
[28:47] and if you don't Satan's gonna continue
[28:50] to punch that if you don't keep it
[28:52] covered if you don't keep that amen
[28:55] constantly amen hidden and covered amen
[28:58] Satan knows where to punch so God is
[29:03] going to purge you they men and it's
[29:06] through trials and tribulations a man
[29:09] and you know what Saints the cleansing
[29:10] starts with the word sometimes I mean
[29:14] the word can go forth and it can be so
[29:16] it could be so it could be so hard to
[29:18] receive amen but cleansing comes from
[29:22] the word if it's the word if it's the
[29:24] truth
[29:24] if it's truth a man it might be hard but
[29:28] it but but it'll help us why because God
[29:31] wants us to produce better fruit amen
[29:33] wants us to produce more fruit hey man
[29:36] he's not satisfied with just 50% when he
[29:39] knows that you can yield more because he
[29:42] knows you Amen he created you praise God
[29:45] and he knows that that life in you amen
[29:48] is his life praise the Lord now look
[29:54] what it says here in in in verse 3 it
[29:56] says now now ye are clean through the
[29:58] word which I have spoken unto you now he
[30:03] is talking to the disciples there and
[30:05] he's telling them he's they're clean
[30:07] with the word amen that he has spoken
[30:09] Amen but we know that they still needed
[30:12] the Holy Ghost because we know what
[30:14] Peter did amen he still he still denied
[30:18] even though he was cleansed by the word
[30:21] a man he was being sanctified by the
[30:23] word he still denied Jesus that's the
[30:28] reason why Saints you've got to have an
[30:30] experience with God you've got to have
[30:32] the new birth for yourself amen
[30:34] and it's a continual process in your
[30:37] life I mean the disciples they were
[30:40] there listening to Jesus they were
[30:42] living with Jesus receiving his word for
[30:45] three and a half years and they thought
[30:48] they oh my this is the maximum this is
[30:50] this is probably I'm just thinking oh
[30:53] this is the this is the fullness we
[30:55] can't get better than this and yet
[30:58] through let's just take Peter for
[31:01] example through what he did denying
[31:03] denying Jesus he probably realized I
[31:08] don't have what I thought that I had I
[31:11] need more of him amen
[31:14] that you wonder why he wept bitterly for
[31:17] one the crow would you know the crow the
[31:21] the crowed and fulfilling what
[31:25] Jesus said that he was gonna do and - he
[31:29] probably thinking you know what I don't
[31:30] I don't have the goods that I thought I
[31:32] had and that's the question saying soon
[31:35] when I asked ourselves do I have what I
[31:37] think I have amen again are you bearing
[31:43] the fruit that you are supposed to bear
[31:47] we don't want to just be satisfied Amen
[31:50] with what we have III know there's more
[31:52] of him Amen because there's more of his
[31:55] word his word is continually meant
[31:58] praise God
[32:00] Ephesians 5:25 says here in verse 3
[32:07] verse 27 husbands love your wives I'm
[32:09] not gonna speak about this but so don't
[32:12] worry husbands love your wives even as
[32:14] Christ also loved the church and gave
[32:16] himself for it that he might sanctify
[32:19] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[32:22] water by the word now you see Saints the
[32:26] water is the word as the reason when God
[32:30] was speaking when Jesus would speak
[32:31] the Nicodemus he says you must be work
[32:33] born again born again of this of the the
[32:37] spirit and and of the water and spirit
[32:41] well the water in the spirit is both the
[32:43] word it's not anything different it's
[32:47] both the word they meant that he might
[32:49] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[32:51] of the water by the word that that he
[32:55] might present it to himself a glorious
[32:57] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[33:01] such thing but that it should be holy
[33:03] and without blemish amen
[33:06] you know Saints when you it's
[33:09] interesting that Paul that Paul says
[33:11] they're without spot or wrinkle when you
[33:14] sisters or when you brothers I hope you
[33:16] brothers too when you get to ironing
[33:20] your shirt or something like that amen
[33:25] when you you know you get the iron and
[33:28] you know you can't just have heat on its
[33:30] own I mean you need to have a little
[33:33] moisture in there yeah you say you need
[33:35] to have some water in there in order to
[33:37] get the wrinkle out amen
[33:39] but now you can't just have the water by
[33:42] itself either you've got to have the
[33:44] heat in there too in order to remove the
[33:46] wrinkle that's the reason why you need
[33:49] the water which is the word great to
[33:51] have the word great day man but you also
[33:53] need those trials that heat a man in
[33:56] order to get the wrinkles out of your
[33:57] life amen
[33:59] you need both of those things together
[34:01] and that's the reason why he said that
[34:02] he's gonna have us a spotless church
[34:06] without spot or wrinkle and that's the
[34:08] only way he's gonna do it continue to
[34:11] give you more trials amen
[34:13] continue put that heat on you amen okay
[34:15] as you continue to receive the word
[34:17] expect for more than four more trials to
[34:20] come into your life
[34:21] for more heat amen because he's trying
[34:25] to iron out wrinkles from your life amen
[34:28] because he wants to have us a spotless
[34:30] and a ring CLIs church amen praise God
[34:35] so
[34:38] you know as the preacher is there
[34:39] preaching you know and he's there
[34:41] preaching that's where he spread you
[34:42] know those those irons where you at
[34:46] water going forth and then all right
[34:49] they received the word that feels great
[34:55] and there's a every but it caused us
[34:58] some steam it causes something to rise
[35:00] amen something happens when that takes
[35:03] place right causes a reaction that's the
[35:08] reaction that God wants from you
[35:09] amen praise the Lord that amen praise
[35:18] God so that water and their spirit amen
[35:20] we know is that word amen jesus said
[35:24] John in John 17:17 sanctify them through
[35:27] thy truth thy Word is truth
[35:31] amen thy Word is truth amen
[35:35] praise the Lord so so and just like the
[35:39] iron Saint you know a tree can't grow
[35:42] without water see the branch is it can't
[35:47] it can't produce branches they can't
[35:49] grow it can't you can't go to his
[35:50] potential without water and of course
[35:53] they cannot grow without without heat or
[35:55] sunlight you see it needs both of those
[35:58] elements and they may in order to grow
[36:00] and that's why you and I Saints we need
[36:02] both of those elements in order to grow
[36:04] praise God we need to have Amen trials
[36:08] to come our way every now and then
[36:10] whoever said to you that the Christian
[36:12] life is easy and it's a flowery bread of
[36:14] bed better v's Amen is lying to you and
[36:19] it's probably trying to get your money
[36:24] because as many of you have tested Pali
[36:28] testified that the Christian life is not
[36:30] easy but it's very worth it it's very
[36:35] worth it email so just keep pressing on
[36:38] st. John SEP John chapter 7 Amen I was
[36:42] looking at this here a little bit ago
[36:43] and it's interesting what Jesus says
[36:46] here the brothers don't have this but
[36:48] they can bring it up if they want John
[36:49] chapter 7 verse 30
[36:51] vii says in the last day that great day
[36:54] of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[36:56] saying if any man thirst let him come
[36:58] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[37:01] me as the scripture hath said out of his
[37:05] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[37:10] now Jesus is here speaking these things
[37:13] you know and he's saying these things
[37:15] and of course the new birth couldn't
[37:17] come he at that time because look what
[37:20] the next verse says it says but this
[37:22] spake he of the Spirit which they that
[37:25] believe on him should receive for the
[37:28] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[37:30] that Jesus was not yet glorified so it
[37:35] took the disciples received the word
[37:37] Amen for three and a half years right
[37:41] they received that water that water was
[37:44] cleansing them amen but it wasn't a man
[37:48] it didn't vent that that that word that
[37:50] they received didn't come to fruition
[37:53] until the day of Pentecost you see when
[37:56] they were in the upper room then that
[37:59] word a man that Jesus came in in the in
[38:03] the form of the Holy Spirit amen and now
[38:05] have vindicated that word in their life
[38:07] that now it wasn't just in their in
[38:10] their in their head a man but now they
[38:12] acted upon the word I am you see now
[38:15] Peter went out and he and with boldness
[38:17] the Bible says and he was able to preach
[38:20] the word and speak the word and and and
[38:22] and and it would be word on top of word
[38:25] word on top of word amen as you if
[38:27] you've read there in Acts chapter 2 so
[38:31] you know that's one of the things Saints
[38:33] that when the Holy Spirit is working in
[38:35] your life as the word is going forth
[38:37] you'll see that it'll just be word on
[38:39] top of word word on top of word and and
[38:42] things start clicking thing things
[38:45] starts things start clicking I remember
[38:47] brother uh the the the last podcast I
[38:49] did with brother Steven coffee from from
[38:51] from North Carolina and he gave gives a
[38:54] testimony there of how when the Lord was
[38:56] dealing with him at fifty you know when
[38:58] he he believed he the Lord death started
[39:02] dealing with him around twelve for 1314
[39:04] years old
[39:05] but when God really when he knows that
[39:07] God filled him with the Holy Ghost a man
[39:09] he says the word just became a brand new
[39:12] book to him it was it was it was it was
[39:15] he got to himself amen and just to him
[39:18] him in the word amen and and and just
[39:21] like things were just clicking one on
[39:23] top of the other one on top of the other
[39:25] I mean and that's what it's supposed to
[39:26] be because it's the life of Christ amen
[39:30] it's the life of Christ revealing itself
[39:32] through your life praise the Lord Amen
[39:37] praise God
[39:38] you know Saint you take the woman at the
[39:41] well you know Jesus Jesus the woman at
[39:45] the well went to to seek physical water
[39:48] instead found spiritual water easy and
[39:53] there and there Jesus she Jesus to start
[39:57] the conversation asks her give me the
[40:00] drink doesn't even doesn't even ask
[40:03] please the Bible doesn't say but give me
[40:08] the drink and but he knew that that was
[40:11] the way to start that conversation you
[40:13] see a man and the conversation goes Amen
[40:16] and and and and as he's and and as he's
[40:19] discerning her amen
[40:20] she realizes she realizes that that word
[40:24] a man she had heard she had to have
[40:26] heard the word at some point in her life
[40:28] because the by but the Bible says that
[40:30] we know that when Messiah comes he's
[40:33] tell us these things you see and he'll
[40:36] tell us all things about is what
[40:38] everyone says and then when the word
[40:41] amen when he says to her when he says to
[40:44] her I am he that speaks to you a man she
[40:46] drops the water pot and runs a man and
[40:49] tells the whole the whole people
[40:50] everybody in her town says come see
[40:53] Amanda told me all things in other words
[40:56] confirmed to me what I had already knew
[40:58] amen and of course we know that's not
[41:01] you know she did
[41:03] that wasn't the feeling of the Holy
[41:05] Ghost because the Holy Jesus hadn't died
[41:07] yet amen but still it's sparked amen
[41:11] something in her II meant that to see
[41:13] that that's Messiah amen praise God
[41:19] and so Saints you know if the word
[41:21] doesn't come across into your life amen
[41:23] you you in order for for God to reveal
[41:25] the word - you have to be in the word
[41:28] that's the reason why we have to be at
[41:30] church that's the reason why we have
[41:32] wherever the word is Amen let's try to
[41:34] be there let's try to constantly amen
[41:36] listen to the word being the word Amen
[41:40] because how can the word be revealed to
[41:42] you if you are not in the word you want
[41:45] a revelation from God God's not gonna
[41:47] give you a revelation through a comic
[41:48] book he's not gonna give you a
[41:49] revelation through Netflix he's gonna
[41:51] give you a revelation through his word
[41:53] Amen that is the water a man that's
[41:56] gonna a man continue to wash you and and
[41:59] eventually will you get a revelation
[42:03] some things we don't understand in the
[42:05] word I think I don't understand
[42:08] everything in the Bible I can't explain
[42:10] everything Amen but I know if I stay in
[42:13] that word eventually it will be revealed
[42:17] through prayer as well amen and God
[42:21] knows your intention in your heart amen
[42:23] he knows why if you if you ask the Lord
[42:27] in a humble heart and you say Lord
[42:29] reveal this to me I don't understand it
[42:33] I want to know I believe there's
[42:36] something there amen God will reveal it
[42:38] to you amen God knows God knows your
[42:41] intentions in your heart and there Jesus
[42:47] said to her to the woman there at the
[42:49] will whosoever drinketh of this water
[42:51] again while he had said there in John 7
[42:53] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[42:55] thirst again that water there in that
[42:57] well she was gonna thirst again if she
[43:00] drank from that well so was Jesus there
[43:03] in the flesh amen but he says here but
[43:07] whosoever drinketh of the water that I
[43:09] shall give him shall never thirst never
[43:14] thirst but the water that I shall give
[43:16] him shall be in him a well of water
[43:20] springing up into everlasting life amen
[43:25] praise the Lord all right now continuing
[43:30] here in John 15
[43:32] Jesus continues to say abide in me and I
[43:36] in you all right as the branch cannot
[43:42] bear fruit of itself that's the reason
[43:46] why Saints you cannot live the Christian
[43:48] life on your own there's nothing you can
[43:52] do to please the to please the Lord on
[43:54] your own amen
[43:56] you have to be connected to that life
[44:00] amen
[44:02] praise God except as the branch cannot
[44:06] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[44:11] the vine no more can ye except ye abide
[44:15] in me praise the Lord you see Saints see
[44:19] you right let's just pretend this as a
[44:20] tree right here just for that for the
[44:22] for the kids you have this tree right
[44:26] here and let's just pretend this is the
[44:28] branch yeah all right and if this branch
[44:35] you know if I just put this branch right
[44:39] here down here on the floor is it gonna
[44:47] buy is it gonna is it gonna produce any
[44:50] fruit why not
[44:53] it's next to the to the tree I mean it's
[44:57] right right there right next to the tree
[44:59] or shouldn't it give off fruit it's
[45:02] sitting it's in close proximity it goes
[45:06] to church it reads the message it reads
[45:11] the Bible it shakes the pastor's hand it
[45:16] acts very nice around their Christians
[45:19] but why is it not given enough fruit
[45:21] right Kaylee why is it not giving any
[45:27] fruit cuz its underground
[45:30] [Laughter]
[45:33] that's right it's on the ground it's not
[45:37] giving in your fruit amen because it's
[45:39] not connected right see when it's
[45:43] connected then it will be able to give
[45:46] our fruit glory right praise the Lord
[45:49] same thing with us Saints if you're not
[45:52] connected with God if you're not
[45:54] connected in the word if then the word
[45:57] is not going to pur be able to help
[45:59] produce fruit in your life right if
[46:04] you're just a church comer if you're
[46:05] just if you're just a benchwarmer that
[46:08] that's all you are a man and you expect
[46:10] for the word to live out through you it
[46:12] won't happen but once you connect
[46:15] through the word once once and God is
[46:17] revealing that word to you and even and
[46:19] it's manifesting through your life amen
[46:21] then you're gonna be able to produce
[46:22] fruit you see so I hope you hope that
[46:27] made a little clearer praise God you
[46:31] have to be connected in Christ right
[46:34] amen and you have a man you have to have
[46:37] that word abiding in you and him about
[46:39] and him you abiding in him and him
[46:42] abiding in you praise God
[46:44] and that word abide is the word Meno
[46:49] which means to abide to remain to dwell
[46:53] to continue to tarry to endure amen
[46:59] praise God it's to stay it's eternal
[47:04] amen
[47:06] like when brother Aaron when when
[47:08] brother Aaron was looking him and his
[47:11] family we're looking for a home for a
[47:13] house they weren't looking for a house
[47:16] to just live everyone now and then to be
[47:21] in it for for a month and then leave six
[47:24] seven months and then and then come back
[47:27] no they were looking for a house to make
[47:30] it a home that they can constantly dwell
[47:33] in and that especially like nights like
[47:36] this night right they have a home that
[47:39] they can go to there's got heat and then
[47:41] you you see and that's the same thing
[47:43] with Christ Saints God doesn't want to
[47:46] do
[47:47] and you every now and then when he gives
[47:49] you the Holy Ghost amen it's an eternal
[47:51] to seal a man and he can't get out
[47:54] and st. can't get in praise God
[47:58] a man it's he doesn't want to dwell
[48:00] every now and then oh I'll come back
[48:03] I'll go to church for just a few a few
[48:05] days a few Sundays and then maybe stay
[48:08] out for about six months
[48:09] amen no the life of Christ doesn't
[48:11] produce that Amen if the life the life
[48:14] of crisis is eternal and it's constant
[48:17] amen
[48:17] and it's full praise God so it's gonna
[48:21] make you produce amen something
[48:24] consistently right
[48:26] you see praise God because why we are we
[48:32] need to produce that fruit amen
[48:36] and verse 5 it says and I am the vine ye
[48:40] are the branches he that abideth in me
[48:43] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[48:48] much fruit for without me you can do
[48:53] nothing you can't do it on your own you
[48:58] you you need him you you you you've got
[49:01] to depend on him amen praise God praise
[49:06] the Lord Jesus and and see Saints that
[49:10] in a tree or in a vine see Jesus has
[49:13] given this example here of a great bond
[49:15] you see of a great vine and in the
[49:19] branches branching off of a great vine
[49:21] but those those branches amen should be
[49:25] made of the same material as the vine
[49:27] you see there's no different material
[49:31] it's the same material and that's the
[49:34] reason why it produces the same life
[49:36] praise God because those branches
[49:41] they're connected to the vine so just
[49:44] you know just like the the the you know
[49:46] if if that microphone which represents
[49:49] the branch was just sitting there next
[49:50] to the to the tree it was not gonna
[49:52] produce anything it could even be made
[49:56] of the same material but it was broken
[49:59] off
[50:00] at some point you see it won't produce
[50:05] any fruit right amen praise God and
[50:12] verse 6 it says if a man abide not in me
[50:15] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[50:19] withered and men gather them and cast
[50:23] them into the fire and they are burned
[50:26] amen so you know Saints we're we're
[50:31] doing damage to ourselves amen if if we
[50:35] don't abide in Christ amen amen you reap
[50:38] what you sow amen
[50:41] you you reap what you sow praise God if
[50:47] you abide in me verse 7 if you abide in
[50:49] me and my words abide in you ye shall
[50:51] ask what you will and it shall be done
[50:54] unto you
[50:55] jesus said in John chapter 8 verse 31 it
[50:58] says he says here's to those Jews which
[51:01] believed on him if you continue in my
[51:05] word then are ye my disciples indeed if
[51:10] you continue being washed by the water
[51:12] of the word if you continue in that life
[51:15] then are you my disciples indeed praise
[51:19] God and you shall know the truth and the
[51:24] truth shall make you free praise God
[51:28] amen you stay you stay in the truth amen
[51:33] you stay in Christ amen knowing the
[51:35] truth they men the truth will set you
[51:37] free
[51:38] praise God for whatever it is that you
[51:40] may be struggling with whatever it is in
[51:42] your life amen
[51:43] truth always will set you free amen
[51:47] praise God
[51:49] herein is my father glorified back to
[51:52] back to John chapter 15 herein is my
[51:54] father glorified that ye bear just a
[51:57] little bit of fruit hmm what does it say
[52:03] there in verse eight you bear much fruit
[52:09] amen now remember that fruit is the
[52:11] fruit of the Spirit
[52:13] right which is the fruit of the word
[52:17] which is the fruit of the life which is
[52:20] the fruit of the the water and the
[52:22] spirit a man it's all the same thing
[52:24] it's all interconnected if you can
[52:27] understand that Saints a man it will
[52:28] help you in your Christian walk with
[52:30] Christ amen you know it'll take doubts
[52:33] it out in your life amen am I born again
[52:35] or not it might and my you know it might
[52:37] you know if you can understand then ask
[52:40] God if you don't understand it God
[52:42] reveal it to me cuz I want to understand
[52:44] their hearing is my father glorified
[52:45] that you bear much fruit so shall ye be
[52:48] my disciples
[52:49] Amen just as he said there if you
[52:52] continue in my word then are you my
[52:55] disciples and Vesey praise God hmm where
[53:02] are we alright now in verse 16 it says
[53:05] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[53:08] you and ordained you that you should go
[53:11] and bring forth fruit and that your
[53:14] fruit should remain right and if it's
[53:18] the fruit of the Spirit Saints it's
[53:20] going to remain praise God it's it's
[53:22] it's eternal
[53:24] hey man it's it it will remain a man if
[53:28] it's the spirit a man but it but
[53:30] whatever whatever your agenda your own
[53:33] thoughts your own things that will never
[53:35] remain see that's the reason why these
[53:38] doctrines are about throughout all these
[53:40] all these all these decades you know
[53:43] different decades these past few decades
[53:46] where are they now
[53:48] they haven't remained amen praise God
[53:52] but if it's if it's from the Word of God
[53:55] if it's if it's the doctrine of the word
[53:57] amen the doctrine of what the prophet
[54:00] preached and the doctrine of the word
[54:02] amen it will remain praise God and if
[54:05] it's the true Holy Ghost in you it will
[54:07] remain amen
[54:08] I mean those those works that she do
[54:11] they men that our Holy Spirit our Holy
[54:13] Spirit guided amen they will remain a
[54:17] man they will they will God God doesn't
[54:20] overlook those things amen
[54:23] God one day we'll you know sometimes we
[54:25] may not
[54:26] understand we may not know somebody out
[54:29] there praying for you and it might be
[54:32] the the least person you'd think in the
[54:34] in the church that doesn't it's not the
[54:37] quietest person in the church and that
[54:40] person probably is gonna have a lot of
[54:42] tributed to her him because Amen those
[54:46] works those fruits remain praise God
[54:50] you see that's that's eternal fruit amen
[54:55] praise God
[54:57] so in Luke chapter 11 it's because Jesus
[55:00] said there at you if you about if he
[55:03] shall if you are if you abide in me and
[55:06] I own I abide in you then whatever ye
[55:09] shall ask the Father in my name he may
[55:11] give it to you see so you have
[55:13] confidence in God now amen when you
[55:16] abiding the word a man when you when you
[55:18] when you and you let the word about in
[55:20] you amen
[55:20] you have confidence to ask whatever you
[55:23] want amen
[55:24] whatever you need and he can give it to
[55:27] you in Luke chapter 11 verse 9 it says
[55:30] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[55:32] ye shall find knock and it shall be
[55:35] opened unto you
[55:36] for every one that asketh receiveth you
[55:40] see and he that seeketh findeth and to
[55:44] him that knocketh it shall be opened man
[55:47] but the key thing is there is to seek to
[55:51] knock and to look for and that's the
[55:55] parts that we struggle with we don't do
[55:58] that therefore we don't receive
[56:01] therefore it's not opened unto us how am
[56:04] I gonna go to a man to brother Dale's
[56:06] house and and then I didn't let him know
[56:08] that that I'm goin but when I go there
[56:10] and if I don't knock the door how is he
[56:12] supposed to know that I'm outside
[56:15] wanting to come in and fellowship with
[56:17] him if I don't ring the doorbell
[56:19] you see same thing with Christ if you
[56:21] don't seek am a man if you don't do what
[56:23] you're supposed to do
[56:24] amen how is he supposed to bless you if
[56:27] you're not in the word how is he gonna
[56:29] best see through the word if you're not
[56:30] if you're not in it you want revelation
[56:33] from God amen get in the word right
[56:35] praise God
[56:39] if a Sun shall last bread of any of you
[56:41] that is a father will he give him a
[56:43] stone if I go and knock it brother Del's
[56:47] door a man will he will he open his
[56:51] window how he supposed to open his door
[56:54] right because I want to come in you see
[57:00] I'll be right out there
[57:03] no and then never comes to the door no I
[57:07] expect for him to open the door right if
[57:11] a son shall last bread of any of you
[57:13] that is a father will he give him a
[57:14] stone or if he ask a fish will here well
[57:18] he for a fish give him a serpent you see
[57:21] you as a father you wouldn't do that to
[57:23] your child you know you wouldn't get you
[57:26] they'd ask they'd ask you for some food
[57:29] a man you'd give him something else you
[57:31] know some a stone or whatever you know
[57:35] you'd give him what they need or if he
[57:37] shall ask an egg will he offer him a
[57:39] scorpion if ye then being evil know how
[57:41] to give good gifts unto your children
[57:42] how much more shall your heavenly Father
[57:46] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[57:49] Jane amen how much more you ask him amen
[57:55] and you ask him in truth in the word
[57:58] amen and say Lord I want that I may not
[58:03] understand it fully but I want it and
[58:06] Saints you know it doesn't have to it
[58:08] doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be
[58:10] a bunch of emotion it doesn't have to be
[58:11] a bunch of shouting him and if the Lord
[58:13] deals with you that way that's great
[58:15] that's that's wonderful amen but
[58:17] remember how the new birth takes place
[58:20] amen you've got to get the baby here
[58:22] first when you get the baby amen when a
[58:25] mom is pregnant and she gives birth they
[58:28] meant to the baby that's the birth amen
[58:32] then the shouting and the screaming and
[58:35] the crying happens after the baby is
[58:37] born you see I've never heard the baby
[58:41] crying inside the stomach I hope no I
[58:46] mean I don't know a few sisters I my
[58:48] wife I don't think she ever when she had
[58:50] our two children
[58:52] it's never happened that way it's the
[58:54] baby comes out first usually they're
[58:56] quiet they're not saying anything right
[59:00] and the water is involved and the blood
[59:03] is involved and I'm sorry it sounds
[59:05] gruesome but but but but the Bible types
[59:08] it this way you see then the baby comes
[59:11] out and then POW smacks it and then the
[59:17] baby starts crying if the baby doesn't
[59:18] cry automatically right that's when does
[59:21] jumping and shouting and screaming and
[59:24] then and that rejoicing and all that
[59:26] stuff that's when it's good then but
[59:29] don't put the cart before the horse just
[59:30] because you screamed and shouted and and
[59:32] then glory hallelujah all throughout the
[59:35] building and everything that that's
[59:36] wonderful you did that but that does it
[59:38] that doesn't guarantee a new birth get
[59:41] the birth first and then those things
[59:43] will come after I meant then Amen that
[59:45] that's just icing on the cake then
[59:47] but some people Saints I don't
[59:51] understand that
[59:52] and they think that the new birth is
[59:54] because I shouted somewhere I screamed
[59:56] that the altar I or I did this and that
[59:59] and the other and there's a lot of
[1:00:00] confusion about that it about the new
[1:00:03] birth because of that amen
[1:00:08] and we'll finish off with this here
[1:00:10] Saints brother Branham says here and
[1:00:11] lamb and dove in in lemon Davis's you
[1:00:18] know a sheep a sheep is very sensitive
[1:00:21] and odd animal and you know a sheep
[1:00:23] never was asked to manufacture a wool he
[1:00:26] was asked to bear wool because he is a
[1:00:29] sheep and as long as he is a sheep he
[1:00:32] will bear wool because that's his nature
[1:00:34] you see a sheep bears wool because he's
[1:00:39] a sheep you see a dog has fur you know
[1:00:46] because he's a dog right a Christian
[1:00:50] bears the fruits of the Christian
[1:00:52] because he's got Christ's life living in
[1:00:55] him
[1:00:55] you see because Saints if I was if I had
[1:00:59] the life of one of these singers out
[1:01:01] here
[1:01:02] modern singers I don't know who they all
[1:01:05] are demi lovato or whatever you know all
[1:01:08] these are these singers that are out
[1:01:09] there if I had the life of Demi Lovato
[1:01:12] and me I'm gonna dance and sing and and
[1:01:16] and like Demi Lovato whatever her name
[1:01:19] is if I had the life of Michael Jackson
[1:01:22] living in me I'm gonna do the moonwalk
[1:01:24] and dance like Michael Jackson and and
[1:01:26] wear rhinestone gloves and you know
[1:01:29] that's why that's why you wonder if some
[1:01:31] of these impersonators you know that
[1:01:33] person a Elvis and and but you wonder
[1:01:35] what kind of spirits well it goes in
[1:01:37] them because some of them look exactly
[1:01:40] like the person
[1:01:42] now take that Saints in the physical and
[1:01:45] you see how people can be just like the
[1:01:47] person right I mean I've seen some very
[1:01:49] close people that look just like Michael
[1:01:53] Jackson and you take Saints the spirit
[1:01:57] of Christ if the Spirit of Christ is
[1:02:00] dwelling in you nobody will confuse you
[1:02:03] is that Michael Jackson or is that Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ no people are gonna know that's
[1:02:11] Jesus Christ Laurie that's Christ in her
[1:02:14] because no shine oh she can't do that
[1:02:16] that's got to be the that's got to be
[1:02:18] the Spirit of Christ in her a man I know
[1:02:20] he can't do that or she can't he can't
[1:02:22] live that way that's got to be something
[1:02:25] higher than him or her amen
[1:02:28] nobody will confuse if you're Christian
[1:02:31] or not when you really have the Holy
[1:02:33] Ghost in your life nobody well nobody
[1:02:35] will confuse and say do you really
[1:02:37] believe the are you really a Christian
[1:02:42] so that's why we have to be careful amen
[1:02:47] when we're trying to put in some of
[1:02:48] these worldly things in the church you
[1:02:51] see sometimes you don't want to look
[1:02:54] like the world the spirit of Christ that
[1:02:57] means the spirit is turning leaning back
[1:02:59] to some other entity when it's leaning
[1:03:03] toward the world it's leaning back to
[1:03:05] the club it's leaning back to a man
[1:03:08] but when the spirit amen when you see
[1:03:09] the sisters dressing right when you see
[1:03:11] the man hey man they're not out there
[1:03:13] Worley and all these things amen
[1:03:15] that means the spirit is leaning a man
[1:03:17] towards the Spirit of Christ amen amen
[1:03:20] was that is that simple enough amen
[1:03:23] praise God and so it is with the
[1:03:26] Christian and so here and so that that
[1:03:29] that that sheep was was just bears wool
[1:03:33] and as long as he is a sheep he will
[1:03:34] bear wool because that's his nature and
[1:03:36] so is it with the Christian Church when
[1:03:39] we were never asked to manufacture
[1:03:42] fruits we were asked to bear fruits
[1:03:45] Galatians 5 said the fruit of the Spirit
[1:03:48] is love joy faith peace long-suffering
[1:03:49] meekness gentleness gentleness patience
[1:03:53] these are not to be manufactured in
[1:03:56] other words you you can't try to do that
[1:03:59] on your own you can't try to live the
[1:04:01] Christian life on your own because you
[1:04:03] will miserably fail you're under the law
[1:04:05] you see there to be products that comes
[1:04:10] from the inside out
[1:04:12] the outside life that we live proves
[1:04:14] what's on the inside so the way you
[1:04:18] dress the way you the way you act and
[1:04:21] the way you you show yourself truly
[1:04:25] shows what's on the inside what's
[1:04:27] working inside now we have tried to
[1:04:30] manufacture this to manufacture the
[1:04:32] fruits of the Spirit and we always turn
[1:04:35] out hypocrisy because you cannot
[1:04:37] manufacture Christianity it's an
[1:04:41] experience by a spirit that lives in you
[1:04:44] and bears fruit of itself you cannot
[1:04:48] manufacture it we have tried to educate
[1:04:50] it and denominated and when we do we
[1:04:54] turn our hypocrisy and failure it's not
[1:04:58] to be done that way it's to be done as
[1:05:00] God intended it to be done the spirit
[1:05:03] inside of us bearing fruits of its
[1:05:06] presence I like that the spirit inside
[1:05:10] of us the Spirit of God inside of us
[1:05:13] bearing its fruit because it's dwelling
[1:05:17] in us I see of its presence that's God's
[1:05:20] program
[1:05:21] can never be changed praise God and in
[1:05:26] the last quote and we'll finish with
[1:05:28] this Saints and as I said this morning
[1:05:30] queen of sheba 1961 as I said this
[1:05:33] morning if the first branch of the vine
[1:05:35] brought forth a Pentecostal church every
[1:05:38] real branch out of that vine will bring
[1:05:39] forth another Pentecostal church but we
[1:05:43] got a lot of grafted branches and they
[1:05:45] bring forth after their kind
[1:05:46] we got Methodist branch grafted into it
[1:05:49] Baptist branch Pentecostal branch every
[1:05:51] other kind of branch it bears its own
[1:05:53] fruit you can take a orange tree and put
[1:05:57] a grapefruit in it it'll live off the
[1:05:58] life of that tree but it'll bear great
[1:06:00] fruit and this is this is this is for
[1:06:03] another topic but
[1:06:04] but it'll bear a great fruit but put a
[1:06:07] lemon in there it'll bear lemon not in
[1:06:09] orange yes it's living off orange life
[1:06:11] see that's that's that's the thing
[1:06:13] Saints you can live off the life of this
[1:06:16] message
[1:06:17] amen you can live off the life of going
[1:06:20] to church
[1:06:20] in other words of living off the boat
[1:06:23] the motions of going to church and and
[1:06:26] being at church and and and and maybe
[1:06:29] every now and then reading a Bible verse
[1:06:32] and every now and then listening to a
[1:06:33] scripture or listening to a message you
[1:06:36] can live off of that but again that
[1:06:39] doesn't mean that you're connected that
[1:06:42] doesn't that just that just means you're
[1:06:44] living down here you're living next to
[1:06:46] it you understand what I'm trying to say
[1:06:49] you're just living next to a beige it's
[1:06:51] not producing true fruits that's two
[1:06:55] different things any church professing
[1:06:58] to be a Christian thrives off the glory
[1:07:01] and praises of Christ but it can't bear
[1:07:04] the fruit it won't bear the life of
[1:07:06] Christ until Christ puts forth that
[1:07:08] branch himself then it'll it'll write
[1:07:11] another book of Acts behind it that's
[1:07:13] right because it is the acts of the Holy
