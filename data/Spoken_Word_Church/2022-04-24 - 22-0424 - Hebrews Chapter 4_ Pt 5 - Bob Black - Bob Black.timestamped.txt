[0:37] god bless you saints it's good to be
[0:39] back in the house of the lord
[0:48] let's just pray before we begin to study
[0:50] lord god we're so grateful to be able to
[0:51] gather back around your word lord and we
[0:53] just pray lord your blessing upon this
[0:55] little study and
[0:56] bless brother wade as he studies there
[0:58] lord we just come an expectation this
[0:59] morning lord grant it lord and your
[1:02] blessing upon this word amen
[1:05] so we've been studying through hebrews
[1:07] chapter four
[1:08] and we we're we're about halfway through
[1:11] i think and we're
[1:12] been looking at rest and what that is
[1:14] and and um
[1:16] and we'll just we'll just start at verse
[1:18] seven here
[1:19] and where paul says again he limited
[1:22] limiteth a certain day saying in david
[1:24] today after so long a time as it is said
[1:26] today
[1:27] if you will hear his voice harden not
[1:29] your hearts
[1:31] for if jesus had given them rest and
[1:33] would he not after would have spoken of
[1:34] another day
[1:36] therefore remaineth therefore arrest to
[1:38] the people of god
[1:41] for he that has entered into his rest he
[1:43] also has ceased from his own works as
[1:45] god did from his
[1:47] and we we we've talked before about how
[1:49] there's a there's always a pattern you
[1:51] you start you start on your journey and
[1:53] you believe and then you labor and then
[1:55] you come to a place where you're resting
[1:57] and not not not in your own works or not
[1:59] in something that maybe you can see with
[2:01] your eyes like that but you're resting
[2:03] in the promises of god what he said
[2:06] let us labor therefore to enter into
[2:08] that rest lest any man fall after the
[2:10] same example of unbelief
[2:12] so you're resting and and what uh not
[2:15] things that you can see and we we put
[2:16] this example at this slide of a picture
[2:19] just to kind of maybe set in our minds
[2:21] what what rest is is is jesus there in
[2:24] that boat and he's you know he's resting
[2:26] in who the word says he is and who he
[2:29] knows he is and and and a revelation
[2:31] that he he's not going to die in that
[2:33] boat and he has power over the winds and
[2:35] the waves and so he's at peace
[2:37] and you know you think uh
[2:39] just listening to brother branham before
[2:41] he was before the service talking about
[2:43] jonah there in the boat
[2:46] jonah there in the whale
[2:48] uh
[2:50] saying all the everything that he could
[2:51] see is lying vanities all around them
[2:53] you know you're you're resting in the
[2:55] promise of god and of course now jonah
[2:57] and that whale is a type of of a type
[2:59] looking ahead to when you get the
[3:01] baptism the holy ghost it's a it's a
[3:03] different kind of rest than what he had
[3:04] he was resting looking to the temple
[3:07] over there if i i know that if i pray
[3:09] that that's where god is that's that's
[3:11] the representation of god and earth but
[3:13] now with the baptismal it goes christ is
[3:16] in you the hope of glory and that that
[3:18] gives you a personal revelation of who
[3:20] jesus christ is and begins to open up
[3:22] the word to reveal to you what your plan
[3:24] what god's plan and purpose is in your
[3:26] life and what you're doing here and
[3:28] the power that god has given into the
[3:30] church to live to live a holy christian
[3:32] life
[3:33] so that's why jesus said in matthew
[3:35] chapter 11 he said come unto me all you
[3:37] that labor and are heavy laden and i
[3:39] will give you rest all those that down
[3:41] through the ages had labored and tried
[3:43] to get come to a place uh a place that
[3:46] that was fulfilled on the day of
[3:48] pentecost the rest that comes by the
[3:50] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:52] where we're looking not to our own cells
[3:54] but to what christ did on the cross you
[3:57] think about hey everything that we do
[3:58] and everything that we believe just
[4:00] centers on what christ did at the cross
[4:02] where he died for our sins and
[4:04] if it wasn't if it wasn't for the fact
[4:06] that he died and then rose again
[4:08] then there would be that would be uh
[4:10] everything that we'd do here would be in
[4:12] in vain it would just be for a gathering
[4:14] but you know just gathering here today
[4:16] this morning proves uh with the life of
[4:19] christ manifested in our members that
[4:21] that he is risen that that he finished
[4:24] the work
[4:26] and so like charles spurgeon said if you
[4:28] rest on the finished work of jesus you
[4:30] have already the best evidence of your
[4:32] salvation in the world you have god's
[4:34] word for it what more is needed so we're
[4:37] resting in what he did and what he said
[4:39] we're resting in his word
[4:42] so brother brown and when he would when
[4:44] he would explain
[4:46] you know when he would when he would
[4:47] talk about what rest is he would go back
[4:49] to the old testament scripture of isaiah
[4:51] chapter in chapter 28 where isaiah said
[4:53] that he is speaking of that rest in
[4:55] verse 12 this is the rest where you may
[4:58] cause the weary to rest and this is the
[5:00] refreshing
[5:01] think about
[5:02] hundreds of years ago isaiah talking
[5:04] about the rest that will be that will
[5:06] come on the day of pentecost with
[5:08] stammering lips and another tongue will
[5:10] he speak to this people and it took so
[5:11] many hundreds of years before that was
[5:14] finally fulfilled and think about what
[5:16] how do you get that rest whom shall he
[5:18] teach knowledge and whom shall he make
[5:19] to understand doctrine the rest that
[5:21] rest comes by the word because the word
[5:24] as as we studied out in the greatest
[5:26] battle ever fault the word makes a way
[5:29] for for the spirit to become active in
[5:31] your life when you believe god's word
[5:32] it's not just like believing
[5:35] reading the dictionary or reading some
[5:37] some some novel or some some self-help
[5:39] book that you can get at the bookstore
[5:41] but the word
[5:42] is is is a supernatural thing it's this
[5:45] is it's the life of god when you receive
[5:48] it it allow it opens up a channel
[5:50] between you and god for god to become
[5:52] active in your life
[5:54] like for example this morning maybe
[5:56] maybe if it was preached that that god
[5:58] cares about you and and preached in that
[6:01] line and you begin to open up
[6:03] your your mind begins to open up to
[6:05] believe that god cares about you
[6:07] whatever your predicament is this
[6:08] morning you begin to open up when the
[6:11] word is preached that god is god is a
[6:13] healer and he died on the cross to save
[6:14] you from your sins you begin to open up
[6:16] and begin to believe that god as god is
[6:19] able to save you from your sins and heal
[6:21] your body
[6:22] and that's the kind of rest that isaiah
[6:24] was talking about here to whom he said
[6:26] this is the rest where you may cause the
[6:28] weary to rest and this is the refresh
[6:30] get in it at a rest when you you come
[6:33] you come through all this labor and then
[6:35] god reveals to you he just drops down
[6:37] right in the moment right when you're
[6:38] sitting in church and reveals to you
[6:40] that he did it
[6:42] and and it's over
[6:44] the word of the lord was under them
[6:46] precept upon precept precept
[6:48] upon precept lying upon line here a
[6:51] little there look because it isn't that
[6:52] true how you know you i i i was telling
[6:55] my wife this morning
[6:57] last night i was reading the sermon and
[6:59] uh i was just meditating on it and and i
[7:01] began to think about how years ago
[7:04] i read that same sermon and i didn't
[7:06] understand it
[7:08] and and and that's how the word is
[7:10] precept upon precept like even these
[7:11] things that we're reading that paul said
[7:13] you know think about them sitting there
[7:16] listening to paul talk about these
[7:18] things that peter said were hard to be
[7:20] understood and it would seem like it
[7:22] would be really hard for your mind to
[7:23] grasp or to understand what he's talking
[7:25] about
[7:26] but precept upon precept hear a little
[7:29] there little and then one day some it
[7:31] just it just all comes into focus and
[7:33] the picture is made clear and you know
[7:35] what god is talking about right that's
[7:38] and then you have you have a rest you're
[7:40] resting on
[7:41] you're resting because you know it's not
[7:44] something that you just figured out or
[7:46] you were educated into but it's that god
[7:48] revealed it to you he dropped down in
[7:50] that moment and it came off life off of
[7:53] the page into life and is a manifested
[7:56] word in your life living
[7:59] living in your members
[8:01] a precept a precept and a precept is
[8:03] is is if you really examine what that is
[8:06] it's a it's it's in this case it's the
[8:09] word actually changing your thinking and
[8:11] changing your like we talked about
[8:13] earlier that
[8:14] to change your thinking from where you
[8:16] think that god hates you to where god
[8:18] loves you and he doesn't want to give
[8:20] you the holy ghost to where he does want
[8:21] to give you the holy ghost and where he
[8:23] doesn't care to know that he does care
[8:25] about you and where and you know all
[8:27] those things that's what the preaching
[8:29] of the gospel does as it as the word is
[8:31] going forth it's precepts to actually
[8:34] change your thinking to mold your mind
[8:37] to know to so that god can work in your
[8:39] life
[8:41] that's why romans chapter 12 says and be
[8:43] not conformed to this world but be
[8:44] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[8:47] that you may prove what is that good and
[8:50] acceptable and perfect will of god and
[8:52] as you allow the word to become
[8:55] effective in your life your your mind
[8:57] and your thinking and your actions are
[8:59] being transformed
[9:01] by that word yes it isn't that something
[9:03] to think about that is it's as we're all
[9:05] sitting here it looks like maybe
[9:07] sometimes like nothing's happening but
[9:09] just like you look at brother and we'll
[9:11] use the example of you look at the ocean
[9:12] and you don't see the water evaporating
[9:14] and going up into clouds and then
[9:16] forming raindrops and but yet
[9:18] something's happening because because as
[9:20] you receive the word your mind is being
[9:23] transformed and you're being changed
[9:27] so brother randomly say now what's the
[9:28] sabbath
[9:29] he was quoting isaiah all tables are
[9:31] full of vomit no one clean who shall he
[9:33] teach knowledge not worldly knowledge
[9:36] not knowledge like where you get
[9:37] schooled into it or something like that
[9:39] but spiritual knowledge who shall he
[9:42] teach knowledge who should he make to
[9:44] understand doctrine oh bless god our
[9:46] organization don't believe this they
[9:48] wouldn't put up with that care what i
[9:49] don't care what your organization
[9:51] believes he's saying what does god's
[9:53] word say about it
[9:55] oh well our pastors you know are
[9:57] educated oh sure certainly got so much
[9:59] education
[10:00] they left god out of it truly for you
[10:03] can tell them the word and they'll walk
[10:05] around and say well i don't believe it
[10:07] just that way you see you see how edgy
[10:10] even these things that i'm reading here
[10:12] it could be like just just letters on
[10:15] the page and education to you but see
[10:17] when the when it's revealed to you
[10:19] that's what we're talking about not just
[10:21] because that you can read it off the
[10:23] page but when it's revealed to you
[10:26] that's why uh you know just kind of we
[10:28] use the example last time to compare
[10:30] education versus revelation because
[10:32] because uh cain was there was edgy he
[10:35] had a good education where he thought he
[10:37] understood how to offer the sacrifice
[10:40] but it was right by revelation that abel
[10:42] knew that it was blood
[10:44] and brother adam would say he said we
[10:45] can't figure these things out a god is
[10:48] past figuring out you've got to believe
[10:50] it see god is known not by knowledge
[10:54] not by education he is known by faith
[10:58] and faith only and faith is a revelation
[11:01] that's what you're resting in that's a
[11:03] rock that you can rest you can you can
[11:05] hang your hat and your soul and
[11:07] everything else on a revelation
[11:09] by revelation not by education but by
[11:12] revelation abel saw that it wasn't
[11:14] bananas or apples that eve eat and he
[11:16] offered blood and god accepted it it was
[11:19] revealed to him
[11:21] i've got down there at the bottom of
[11:23] that scripture in ii corinthians that we
[11:25] we read who hath made us able ministers
[11:27] of the new testament not of the letter
[11:30] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[11:33] but the spirit giveth life the spirit is
[11:37] what is taking the word that we read and
[11:39] revealing it to us you know think about
[11:41] how many how many people have probed at
[11:44] um
[11:45] at what the seven seals are and what the
[11:47] seven thunders and things and you can
[11:49] probe at it by education but when god
[11:51] comes down and reveals it to you then
[11:54] then you know it's true then you really
[11:56] know it it's not something that you can
[11:58] just debate over the kitchen table or
[12:00] debate when you go out to people at
[12:02] shawnee's or wherever you go out to eat
[12:03] with believers and things but it's it's
[12:05] re it's revealed and it's it's it's true
[12:08] then
[12:09] you can rest on it
[12:11] so brother adam said in christ the
[12:12] mystery god revealed remember the
[12:14] sabbath day keep it holy one day in the
[12:17] week
[12:19] now he magnified it the rest comes from
[12:22] keeping the spirit of god
[12:24] precept upon precept and lying upon line
[12:28] here a little and there little
[12:29] hold fast that's what that what's good
[12:32] for with stammering lips and other
[12:34] tongues will i speak to this people
[12:36] and that is the rest that's the
[12:38] refreshing from the presence of the lord
[12:41] amen
[12:43] and comparing with when ruth was uh the
[12:46] journey of ruth when ruth was resting it
[12:49] was a type of the church resting in the
[12:51] promises of god
[12:53] we have the earnest now of our salvation
[12:55] we're not worried whether we're going
[12:57] over there or not we're going that's
[12:59] right god said so god promised it yes
[13:02] and we've got the earnest
[13:04] done being received christ has accepted
[13:06] us no way to get away from it now we're
[13:08] there
[13:09] all we have to do is just wait
[13:12] he's down doing the kinsmen redeemer
[13:14] we have the earnest of it right now
[13:17] waiting for the time that when he comes
[13:19] back
[13:21] and he said again
[13:22] when that next thing ruth was ruth was
[13:25] rewarded and we talked about how
[13:27] you know that the church went through
[13:29] the lutheran went into the baptism of
[13:30] the holy ocean in the last days and and
[13:32] now resting with the earnest of our
[13:34] inheritance that we know that something
[13:36] happened in us
[13:38] we we've passed from death into life
[13:40] and waiting groaning with nature for
[13:42] that time when we will receive an
[13:44] immortal life and immortal fullness our
[13:47] bodies will be redeemed
[13:49] what are you resting in the resting in
[13:51] the promises of god
[13:53] so hebrews 4 11 says let us labor
[13:55] therefore
[13:56] to enter into that rest
[13:58] lest any man fall after the same example
[14:01] of unbelief and how do you labor you
[14:03] labor by being at your postal duty on
[14:06] church you labor by
[14:08] doing doing the things that maybe when
[14:10] you get up in the morning that you don't
[14:12] really want to
[14:14] sometimes you don't you don't feel like
[14:16] praying but you're laboring because
[14:18] there's something in you drawing and
[14:20] pulling
[14:21] sometimes maybe at the end of the day
[14:22] you feel like the the day's been used up
[14:25] and maybe there's not time enough to
[14:26] read your bible but you labor you open
[14:29] up that bible and you begin to search
[14:30] things out why because there's something
[14:32] drawn in you to understand what the word
[14:35] says because you need you need that rest
[14:39] there's something laboring now now let's
[14:41] let's before we go to the next slide
[14:43] let's think let's get in our we we quote
[14:45] hebrews 4 12 so many times but think the
[14:48] context of what paul is saying sometimes
[14:51] for us to really understand what
[14:53] scripture means it helps us to put the
[14:54] before and after together
[14:56] all this time we've been talking about
[14:58] entering paul's been talking about
[14:59] entering and rest and rest comes by a
[15:02] revelation of the word
[15:04] and and and and how god gives us his
[15:06] word to a precept upon precepts so that
[15:09] we can have something to rest in when
[15:11] god reveals it to us so hebrews 4 12
[15:14] says for the word of god
[15:17] is quick
[15:18] and powerful
[15:20] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[15:23] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[15:25] soul and spirit and other joints and
[15:27] mirror
[15:28] and as a discerner of the thoughts and
[15:30] intents of the heart
[15:31] the word of god is what you need to
[15:34] enter into rest
[15:35] and now i got a picture of this
[15:38] the way that brother brahma described
[15:39] that sword when he was up on that on
[15:41] that mountain and he lifted his hands up
[15:42] and a sword dropped in the way that he
[15:44] described that sword is it looks like
[15:46] this a sword that you could do with that
[15:48] had a little something over the fingers
[15:50] to protect your fingers that you can you
[15:52] could hold that you hold that sword out
[15:54] and go to dueling with somebody
[15:56] go to uh you know when you when you're
[15:58] talking to a jehovah's witness or
[15:59] somebody that that believes in some of
[16:01] these strange doctrines you you got that
[16:03] sword because you you have an
[16:05] understanding that god has given to you
[16:08] and you can go to dueling with it and it
[16:10] and the sword will protect you you can
[16:12] block and defend and things and and look
[16:14] look what the word is the word the word
[16:17] is quick
[16:18] the word is alive
[16:20] it's actually a living word and it's
[16:23] powerful that's why you know the bible
[16:25] says that he give us power to become
[16:27] sons of god and his power is in his word
[16:30] that if you want to be the son of god
[16:31] this morning and you hear somebody
[16:33] preach that is attainable that god wants
[16:36] you to give the
[16:37] receive the holy ghost and then that is
[16:40] power to you that you can take that and
[16:42] you can go against the devil anything
[16:43] the devil comes and throws at you when
[16:45] the devil comes with you with some kind
[16:47] of strange things in your mind well i
[16:49] don't i don't believe that it's for you
[16:51] i don't believe that you can get you've
[16:52] been sick too long that you could take
[16:54] that word and battle the devil every
[16:57] time anywhere you can battle him just
[16:59] like when jesus battled the devil when
[17:01] he came to him them three times why
[17:02] don't you turn the stones into bread all
[17:04] those different things well how did he
[17:05] battle the devil with the word
[17:08] the word is quick and powerful and see
[17:12] what it does this morning as as we get
[17:14] prepared for the for the for the sermons
[17:16] today what's happening is the word is
[17:18] actually because it's alive is acting
[17:21] like a surgeon that when you come to the
[17:24] house of god sometimes you're sick you
[17:26] might be afflicted you might sick in
[17:28] your soul and what the word does is it
[17:30] goes in there and it starts performing
[17:32] surgery
[17:34] now the bible says that this is a
[17:36] different translation it's alive and
[17:38] active
[17:39] it's sharper than any double-edged sword
[17:42] it penetrates even to dividing soul and
[17:45] spirit joints and mirror it judges the
[17:48] thoughts and attitudes of the heart
[17:51] so you think about somebody maybe they
[17:52] come to church and they that where they
[17:54] realize they need something and they're
[17:56] wondering what they need and then the
[17:57] word goes forth and it begins because
[17:59] it's alive it begins to deal with that
[18:02] person and deal with that individual to
[18:04] bring them to a place of repentance or
[18:06] bring them to a place to realize that
[18:08] maybe they didn't know what they thought
[18:09] they knew and so the word is actually
[18:11] acting like it's like acting like a
[18:13] surgeon where it's you know a surgeon
[18:15] don't don't use a dull knife the surgeon
[18:18] uses a lot of times they'll use that um
[18:20] i'm i'm drawing a blanket the material
[18:24] yes a scaffold but they're made out of
[18:25] something that's extra extra sharp
[18:27] because
[18:28] it'll go in and you when you start
[18:30] cutting things out you don't want
[18:32] something just you got to saw with or or
[18:34] mess around with but you want something
[18:36] that's going to be just slice like
[18:38] butter and that's what the word does the
[18:41] word the word preached will bring you to
[18:44] a place of remembrance bring you to a
[18:45] place of knowledge that that you need
[18:47] something else you think about the first
[18:50] time maybe that you heard that it really
[18:51] opened up to you that you needed the
[18:53] virtues and you're sitting there
[18:55] thinking i i thought i thought that i
[18:57] was
[18:57] maybe finished with my journey but yet
[19:00] now the word is open it up and it's
[19:01] beginning to reveal to me that there's
[19:03] more to this thing and the word begins
[19:05] to surgically change your thinking and
[19:07] change things and begins to remove
[19:09] things that aren't supposed to be there
[19:11] that's the sometimes the word is cutting
[19:13] in it you you know
[19:14] you you you maybe you leave feeling like
[19:17] you got some things sliced off of you a
[19:19] little bit because it's a little bit
[19:20] rough because that's what the word is an
[19:23] alive thing
[19:25] it's alive
[19:29] when brother ram said in the patmos
[19:30] vision he said now paul said that the
[19:32] word came in power as well as voice
[19:36] the word preached actually demonstrated
[19:38] itself
[19:40] like a flaming cutting sword
[19:42] it went to the consciousness of men
[19:45] that's what the word is doing it's going
[19:47] to your conscience to your thinking to
[19:50] the way that you think about things
[19:52] and like a surgeon's knife
[19:55] it cut out the diseases and set captives
[19:58] free
[19:59] you see how you this morning if you want
[20:01] to be delivered of something or
[20:02] something something in your life that
[20:04] ain't right if you just yield yourself
[20:06] to the word
[20:08] and the word is the thing that was
[20:10] performed spiritual supernatural surgery
[20:14] everywhere those early believers went
[20:15] they went preaching the gospel the word
[20:17] and god confirmed that word that word
[20:20] with signs following
[20:21] the sick were healed devils were cast
[20:23] out and they spoke in new tongues that
[20:25] was the word
[20:27] in action
[20:28] that word has never failed in the mouths
[20:31] of believing christians
[20:33] and in this last stage it is here
[20:35] stronger and greater than ever in the
[20:36] true word bride
[20:38] oh little flock you little minority hold
[20:40] on to the word fill your mouth and heart
[20:41] with it and someday god will give you
[20:44] the kingdom
[20:45] now look at what it's doing the word is
[20:48] quick and powerful as a two-headed sword
[20:52] sharper than any two-edged sword
[20:54] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[20:56] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[20:58] mirror and what we've been talking about
[21:00] as we go up the statue of perfect man
[21:02] dealing with your soul
[21:04] and dealing with your spirit and dealing
[21:06] with your body
[21:08] your soul dividing us under soul and
[21:11] spirit and joints and mirror of the
[21:13] joints and mayor
[21:15] now without without this word that
[21:17] opened up in this last day how would we
[21:19] even know
[21:20] what the center realm was or that you
[21:22] had a spirit and how those things
[21:24] interact with one another and you see
[21:27] what the word is doing is the word is
[21:28] being preached it'll reveal it'll cut
[21:30] down and reveal to you whether or not
[21:32] you're even born again if your soul is
[21:34] at rest or not
[21:35] and you can by the preaching of the word
[21:37] it will open up to you where you are you
[21:40] can know where you are on the statue of
[21:42] a perfect man and you can know whether
[21:44] or not you're adopted or not and you can
[21:46] know by the preaching of the of the word
[21:49] whether or not the seals have become
[21:51] open open to you to reveal to you the
[21:53] redemption of your body by the preaching
[21:55] of the gospel
[21:57] see the word is what is dividing asunder
[21:59] is dealing with dealing with it
[22:01] supernatant in a supernatural way
[22:03] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[22:05] other joints and marrow and what the
[22:07] brotherhood said he said it cuts us
[22:09] under the carnal from the spiritual
[22:12] it cuts away all of your carnal ideas
[22:14] your carnal understanding and and and
[22:17] leaves a supernatural understanding
[22:20] that'll give you rest
[22:24] because what what what the word does
[22:26] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[22:28] intents of the heart
[22:30] you know you ever you ever come to
[22:32] church and you and and and maybe you
[22:33] have a need you haven't you you want
[22:36] something to be answered and the
[22:37] preacher will just preach right on that
[22:39] particular spot and and and give you the
[22:42] answer because god knows what you have
[22:43] need of now maybe the preacher doesn't
[22:45] know but the word is a discerner of the
[22:48] thoughts and intents of the heart
[22:50] and that's why the bible says
[22:51] or paul would say that the the god's
[22:54] word is like a mirror that when you look
[22:56] into the mirror it reflects back so you
[22:59] can see where you are you see if you're
[23:02] bearing the image of christ you you can
[23:04] see you can see it
[23:06] actually as as we're as we're as as the
[23:09] word is going forth
[23:10] it will unfold to you what you have need
[23:12] of in that moment
[23:14] what does what does discern means
[23:16] deserve means to distinguish like it's
[23:19] it's
[23:20] this is true or this is false or this is
[23:22] right and this is wrong and and the word
[23:25] is discerning the word as you listen to
[23:27] it just actually discerns
[23:29] what's what's wrong in your life
[23:33] in psalm chapter see what what what is a
[23:35] discern a discerner is like a
[23:38] the word what what the word is doing is
[23:40] like it's like a flashlight where where
[23:43] it's a light on your life
[23:46] and when the light like turning a light
[23:47] on in your life it illuminates whether
[23:50] your life is just full of cockroaches
[23:52] and things that shouldn't be there or
[23:54] whether it's something real and pure
[23:57] psalm chapter 119 says through thy
[23:59] precepts i get understanding therefore i
[24:01] hate every false way thy word is a lamp
[24:03] unto my feet
[24:05] and a light unto my path
[24:10] so you know when the words going forth
[24:12] now listen to what the rest of this
[24:14] verse
[24:15] says as we're closing on these last few
[24:17] thoughts the rest hebrews 4 12 a
[24:20] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[24:22] the heart
[24:23] and hebrews
[24:25] verse 13 says neither is there any
[24:27] creature
[24:28] that is not manifest in his sight
[24:31] but all things are naked and open unto
[24:34] the eyes of him with whom we have to do
[24:37] all things are open brother bob this is
[24:40] a really strange
[24:41] image that you got up here but listen to
[24:44] god and god can see everything and he
[24:46] can see he can he can see the nature of
[24:49] a little dove flying arrested on a
[24:50] branch and down in the bottom of the sea
[24:54] he can see in the darkest realm he can
[24:56] see these horrible creatures at the
[24:58] bottom
[24:59] that would scare you and i
[25:01] now see that's what the word is doing
[25:03] the word illuminates in your life if
[25:06] you've got the nature of a dove or if
[25:08] you've got the nature of something
[25:09] horrible
[25:11] something that you know if we're if we
[25:13] were really illuminated by our visible
[25:15] eye we would be maybe shocked at it
[25:17] there's nothing that is not manifest in
[25:20] his sight he knows everything and the
[25:23] word illuminates what's wrong in our
[25:25] life or what's right in their life
[25:28] you have you ever come to church and you
[25:30] and you maybe you feel things and the
[25:31] musicians can go on come come forward
[25:34] and and go ahead and change
[25:36] uh
[25:37] start changing the service
[25:39] you ever felt maybe
[25:40] in your christian journey where you
[25:42] maybe you were wondering is the preacher
[25:43] preaching on me or something that's
[25:45] that's maybe the word
[25:46] probing is something in your life that
[25:48] needs to be changed but then you come to
[25:50] a place where like brother branham in
[25:52] one place he said you can come to a
[25:53] place where you don't feel like you're
[25:55] being preached at any more
[25:57] and that's where the words open up and
[25:59] the pictures being formed and you're at
[26:01] rest because
[26:03] maybe the word is illuminating that
[26:05] there's that little dove nature in your
[26:06] life
[26:07] and we'll just stop there and we'll
[26:08] continue on we're getting close to
[26:10] hebrews chapter five so
[26:12] god bless you saints
[26:16] [Applause]
