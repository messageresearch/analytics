[31:26] here that way there's nothing inside
[31:27] here they'll be outside in the parking
[31:30] lot so we're going to try that and see
[31:32] how that'll work a little bit more
[31:33] festive for July the 4th and it will
[31:36] take off the sisters too they'll be
[31:39] cleaning all that up out there we'll
[31:40] just have to keep clean what's inside so
[31:42] remember that that would be July the

[31:47] going to byc which is fine we do a lot
[31:50] of things for the kids and we want to
[31:52] make sure the kids get taken care of all
[31:54] right so and then also July 14 15 16

[31:59] will be church service here also but
[32:02] sign up if you're going for rooms
[32:05] that we can get to accommodate everybody
[32:08] and remember that Wednesday night
[32:10] brother Aaron will be speaking for us so
[32:12] all mine's clear everything good
[32:15] I appreciate you listening this morning
[32:17] I
[32:18] I that was all said from my heart it's
[32:21] it's something that I like to do I like
[32:24] to have fellowship and and just to
[32:26] reiterate what I was talking about you
[32:28] know if you take a church
[32:30] that's real small and there are small
[32:33] churches around us
[32:34] they can't afford to have things
[32:37] okay they can't afford to have a special
[32:40] meeting because I'm telling you a
[32:41] special meeting costs money
[32:44] I mean when we feed a hundred people
[32:48] and don't charge you anything
[32:51] but it comes from your tithes and
[32:52] offering it comes from from uh you know
[32:55] brother Dale not taking all the tithes
[32:56] like some people do but small churches
[32:58] can't afford to do it so I I I just kind
[33:01] of took it as a burden on myself that
[33:03] we're big enough to where we can absorb
[33:06] some of that
[33:08] and and give a meeting where people
[33:10] don't have to pay and and like the the
[33:13] uh the The Father's day trip and all
[33:16] these other trips that we take we try to
[33:18] invite people to Fellowship we want we
[33:20] don't want to be a a commune or a or a
[33:23] cult or or someone you know off on an
[33:25] island by their self we want to
[33:28] Fellowship around the word of God and we
[33:31] need fellowship and even those small
[33:33] churches that can't afford to do that
[33:34] they need Fellowship too so if we can
[33:37] get them to come in here and and give
[33:39] them a you know a place to do something
[33:41] it won't cost a lot of money or cost you
[33:43] any money then I think the Lord will
[33:45] bless us he's already blessed us with
[33:47] the finances to be able to do it and
[33:49] brother Dale's always been so just free
[33:52] with letting us do
[33:54] um things for people and we appreciate
[33:57] that because some places can't do it
[33:59] like I said but I appreciate it but we
[34:01] do need to if we're going to be able to
[34:02] do that and we're a big enough church we
[34:04] ought to be able to all pitch in and not
[34:06] be everybody one person's responsibility
[34:08] to do all the work so we appreciate you
[34:12] you
[34:13] we appreciate every one of you we
[34:15] appreciate the time that you bring in
[34:17] the in the storehouse we appreciate the
[34:20] the the support we get
[34:22] all the way through
[34:24] uh deacons and elders and all the way
[34:26] down we really all appreciate the things
[34:28] that you do for this church so
[34:31] um all mine's clear so we're we're good
[34:34] everything's good sister Clayton and I
[34:36] were talking a little bit ago
[34:37] she's kind of like me she says I say
[34:39] what I say and I'm done
[34:42] now don't hold no grudges and I said I'm
[34:44] exactly the same way you know that I say
[34:47] what I'm going to say and you ain't
[34:49] gonna hear me say it no more unless it
[34:52] happens again
[34:54] but you say what you're saying and then
[34:56] and it's hard for me and we're going to
[34:58] talk about this next Sunday because if
[35:01] you bring in brotherly kindness there is
[35:03] one word that you have got to totally
[35:06] get out of your vocabulary
[35:10] selfishness
[35:14] you can't put brotherly kindness and
[35:16] selfishness together
[35:19] selfishness has to go
[35:22] to love your brother to love your
[35:24] neighbor as you love yourself all
[35:27] selfishness has to go
[35:29] so we'll talk about that next Sunday
[35:31] about being selfish selfishness or
[35:33] selfies
[35:36] so anyway I may I may go buy a selfie
[35:39] stick and see what it's like
[35:42] no I don't think so I ain't wasting my
[35:44] money on that
[35:45] so let's buy our heads
[35:47] dear Lord thank you for this day you
[35:48] give us we appreciate the time on this
[35:51] Earth that we have
[35:53] Lord there's millions of people won't
[35:55] see this day end
[35:56] father we pray that you would as we are
[35:59] listening to you Lord I pray that you

[36:13] we're sheep we have to be led we have to
[36:16] be shepherded we have to be told where
[36:18] to go and what to do sometimes but Lord
[36:21] that's all of us from here all the way
[36:23] to the back lord we we want to commit
[36:25] ourselves to you and let you have
[36:27] control of what's going on let it not be
[36:30] man's ideas man has not built this
[36:32] church but the Holy Ghost has built this
[36:35] church through men and we appreciate
[36:38] that Lord and we thank you for the
[36:39] guidance that you give us all these
[36:41] years and I pray that you'll guide us
[36:42] even more now as we head toward the
[36:45] headstone we head toward the coming of
[36:48] the king

[36:52] Millennium or a wedding supper and then
[36:53] go into the Millennium father we we long

[37:03] during the furthermore this service we
[37:04] were the ones that are sick be with the
[37:06] missionaries on the Foreign Fields and

[38:00] yeah and Billy George most of you know
[38:03] brother George Quinn I was asking him if
[38:04] he was coming over here in August
[38:06] because you know we have camp meeting
[38:07] and he's usually the first one dad
[38:09] always he was the first soon as we that
[38:11] first Sunday after camp meeting both
[38:13] George spoke for us well he's not coming
[38:15] this year but both Keith Reed is so he's
[38:17] going to take this place and he's going
[38:19] to preach the first Sunday in August
[38:20] after the camp meeting but I wanted to
[38:22] make sure to leave it open for both of
[38:24] George and brother George said he just
[38:25] can't get away right now he just he just
[38:28] can't
[38:29] um leave his kids and leave the church
[38:32] there with sister Jackie gone but um
[38:35] that's one sincere brother right now I'm
[38:37] going to tell you you all know that
[38:39] you've known brother George he's he's
[38:40] just a just a solid individual too we've
[38:43] known him for many years so let's just
[38:44] pray for him though that that God will
[38:46] fill that void
[38:48] that that's left by his wife passing so
[38:51] John 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[38:53] where it was with God and the Word was
[38:55] God and the Word was made flesh and
[38:57] dwelt among us we beheld his glory the
[38:59] glory the only begotten of the father
[39:00] full of grace and truth you may be
[39:02] seated Lord that is blessing to the
[39:04] reading of the word
[39:08] God took something that stinks
[39:11] rotten
[39:14] sometimes don't look very good
[39:17] sometimes don't act very good
[39:19] hello somebody and he decided that's
[39:22] what he's going to work through
[39:24] I'm going to take flesh and I'm going to
[39:26] work through it
[39:27] and I know many people we all struggle
[39:30] with different things but listen
[39:32] we're all human
[39:34] and if you're born again we're all
[39:35] humans with a new birth all right if
[39:37] you're not you're you're you know I hope
[39:39] you're working toward that but common
[39:42] denominator is we're human
[39:44] okay and we've got human things and
[39:46] we've got human parts that we have to
[39:48] deal with we're all you know if we get
[39:50] older you're falling apart my Heavens I
[39:53] told you another day I said I can see
[39:55] why the the older people spend more a
[39:57] lot of times in the doctor's office
[40:00] and I'm just 63 but Mom and Dad myself
[40:03] from June's you know went through the
[40:05] surgery she's went through I'm like man
[40:08] but it's because your body is not
[40:10] getting younger it is getting older and
[40:13] it is literally falling apart
[40:19] bless you and but now but God gave us
[40:23] doctors praise the Lord to try to help
[40:25] us prop that thing back up but but it's
[40:28] not going to get rid of
[40:30] I was reading something the other day I
[40:32] was looking at some articles about
[40:33] different vitamins and I'm a vitamin
[40:36] taker I I take more than I did before
[40:38] but but the disclaimer is is now you
[40:42] take vitamins and I'll tell you now you
[40:44] take vitamins think about you take
[40:45] vitamins all different you know I need K
[40:48] you need potassium and you need
[40:50] phosphorus and we all need these
[40:52] different vitamins for these different
[40:53] things vitamins are not a cure
[40:57] vitamins will never cure you of anything
[41:00] it will help you get through your
[41:02] arthritis day it'll help you get through
[41:04] your day of whatever whatever it will
[41:07] help you get through but it will not
[41:08] eliminate or eradicate cancer or
[41:12] eradicate whatever but it vitamins are
[41:14] and the reason that I take vitamins two
[41:16] is because you look where brother Brown
[41:19] says he said that he said our bodies are
[41:21] falling apart because of what food
[41:23] the food we eat is so perverted so I'm
[41:26] going to try to help myself if they if
[41:29] they've uh through processed food if
[41:30] they suck all this potassium out I'm
[41:33] going to try to eat a banana or I'm
[41:34] gonna you know I'm gonna try to eat this
[41:35] or do this one just kind of life lessons
[41:38] here today but but remember when you
[41:41] when you hand somebody a vitamin and say
[41:43] this will cure and I don't believe that
[41:46] and let me tell you something else about
[41:48] vitamins it's not an instant
[41:53] most vitamins you have to take six
[41:55] months before they do you any good start
[41:56] doing you any good so don't be one of
[41:58] these you pop two in your mouth and then
[42:00] tomorrow go man this thing don't work
[42:01] you got to let your body process it but
[42:03] listen God give us that I believe he
[42:06] gave us vitamins and man I believe he
[42:09] gave us vitamins to make it through not
[42:11] to cure everything but to make it
[42:13] through I understand that more now now
[42:15] some of you young people are looking at
[42:16] me like you always do like what are you
[42:18] talking about one day you'll need
[42:20] something
[42:22] you'll need an aid
[42:25] hearing aid
[42:26] walking Aid y'all just drink lemonade
[42:30] and that's about it but we we I'm
[42:34] telling you uh
[42:36] somebody the other day we were saying
[42:37] something and and they were trying to
[42:39] get up who was that trying was it Josh
[42:41] somebody was trying to get up out of the
[42:42] floor and I said see you there
[42:45] um
[42:46] you need some help get up out of that
[42:48] floor give me a hand well
[42:51] so anyway God's there to give us a hand
[42:52] but we but God decided that he was going
[42:55] to live in this human body
[42:57] now he wasn't going to eradicate
[43:00] the fall right to a degree he's not
[43:02] going to eradicate the fall this thing's
[43:04] going to be sticking till the time we
[43:05] take a change time we take a change
[43:07] that's when we will revert back
[43:10] to a new body this body made new
[43:12] everybody with me all right so we're not
[43:15] looking for sinless Perfection we're not
[43:17] looking if we go up to Statue of perfect
[43:19] man we can do away with our pills
[43:22] you understand what I mean we're not
[43:24] looking for some like I was saying today
[43:26] we're not looking at this morning about
[43:28] godliness everybody says godliness and
[43:30] all of a sudden there's a big I mean
[43:32] it's just like a big push
[43:34] you can't be Godly and I can't be Godly
[43:36] we're just we're full of mistakes and
[43:39] full of and you and who's doing this you
[43:42] are God
[43:44] you're pushing it away because I read
[43:47] you scripture after scripture after
[43:49] scripture where God's telling us we're
[43:51] already blameless we're already Godlike
[43:54] we're already deity
[43:57] already not going to be but that's the
[43:59] inside person but it's got a show on the
[44:02] outside it's gotta let that outside man
[44:04] do what the inside man says all right
[44:08] so
[44:10] so Peter one of the ones that really
[44:13] needed this statue of perfect man God
[44:16] gave him the inspiration to tell us to
[44:19] and besides this giving all diligence
[44:21] add to your faith virtue you virtue
[44:24] knowledge and knowledge Temperance
[44:25] tempers patience the patient's got it
[44:28] these are ads anti-godliness brotherly
[44:30] kindness and brotherly kindness charity
[44:33] First Timothy 3 16 look without
[44:35] controversies I'm trying to tell you
[44:37] today there there is a controversy about
[44:40] godliness but he shouldn't be any bright
[44:41] in the bride there shouldn't be a
[44:43] controversy here
[44:45] the controversy yes let them have that
[44:47] controversy let them be but what they're
[44:50] going to do is though without
[44:52] controversy great is the mystery of
[44:54] godliness in other words we know where
[44:57] it's at right
[44:58] we know how to live it
[45:01] you can't tell me you don't know how to
[45:03] live godliness when you got the book
[45:05] right here and it's pretty plain
[45:07] then God because of our ignorance
[45:11] give us 1100 sermons through a prophet
[45:13] of mouth peace to take this and to
[45:16] enhance this
[45:19] give us the Love Letter the in between
[45:21] that then between the lines how much he
[45:23] really loves us not how much he wants to
[45:25] kill us or beat us up he wants to love
[45:27] us but he wants us to love us doing what
[45:30] he said
[45:31] so then if you don't then like I read
[45:33] this morning then you are condemned with
[45:35] the world
[45:37] all right the whole world is going to be
[45:39] condemned except the bride
[45:43] even foolish virgin listen foolish
[45:45] virgin are going to be condemned because
[45:46] they don't go on to receive the Holy
[45:48] Ghost brother Brown said they got to go
[45:49] through the tribulation and die
[45:52] right they got to die in the tribulation
[45:54] so they're so they're they're over here
[45:56] still they're not bride bride is born
[45:59] again it goes into Rapture doesn't have
[46:01] to go through this doesn't have to go
[46:03] through the tribulation
[46:04] I was thinking the other day
[46:08] I've told you many times before
[46:11] uh dad had a friend of ours
[46:14] uh he's a friend of all of our family
[46:15] he's really helped us out because he was
[46:17] a uh he was a solicitor in Hall County
[46:19] for
[46:20] well all his life his name was Jerry
[46:22] Riley and that saved his life when he
[46:24] was a little boy he got he was drowning
[46:26] and dad picked him up out of the water
[46:27] and throwed him back up on the shore and
[46:29] he's always worked and done things for
[46:31] us well he didn't make it through heart
[46:33] surgery the other day and he's 79 and he
[46:36] passed well you know you think bad about
[46:39] it but you know I was standing in the
[46:40] funeral home and I looked down and I
[46:42] thought
[46:43] there's another one
[46:45] he will not have to go through the
[46:47] tribulation
[46:49] he safely tucked away somewhere
[46:53] because I'll promise you on the day of
[46:56] judgment
[46:59] he'll come up and he may never knew
[47:01] nothing about uh he was a Christian man
[47:04] as far as I know but never accepted the
[47:06] message ooh
[47:11] but what about him coming to and and
[47:15] then dad's like hey this guy's been nice
[47:17] to us the whole family for his whole
[47:19] life
[47:20] he said all right come on in
[47:22] you've done the same to my little ones
[47:24] you've done it to me
[47:26] and and God has now preserved him and
[47:29] put him over into a dimension whether
[47:32] it's whether it's Joy or happiness or
[47:34] whatever at least he's not here to go
[47:37] through this tribulation he has been
[47:39] preserved to a place because God knows
[47:42] in in his infinite mind he's going to
[47:44] give him eternal life into its own
[47:45] judgment all right so so I just was was
[47:48] praising the lord inside of me I'm like
[47:51] man there's another one like we were
[47:52] talking about there's one that God's
[47:54] preserving and putting him up or her up
[47:56] that waiting for a time that they can be
[47:58] given eternal life and not have to go
[48:00] through the Judgment that's how much God
[48:02] honors me and you
[48:04] he'll take them out of this life for you
[48:07] and you think that's horrible and sure
[48:09] is horrible with for his wife in
[48:11] different ones but but they don't
[48:13] understand
[48:14] they don't understand that that was a
[48:17] Providence of God to let him uh not
[48:20] survive that uh heart surgery they said
[48:22] he really went through it fine and he
[48:24] had a couple of a couple of blockages
[48:26] and they did all that and put him back
[48:28] together and he was fine actually sent
[48:30] his wife home and said hey everything's
[48:32] good you know come back tomorrow go rest
[48:34] by the time she got home
[48:36] they were keeping him alive so she could
[48:38] get back something happened in his
[48:40] valves or something had a couple of
[48:42] valves replaced and he didn't make it
[48:44] which is really sad but you know what I
[48:46] was joy in my heart that hey there's
[48:48] another one that's been put up
[48:51] just for you just for us just for diet
[48:53] just for our family he was good to us
[48:56] and he was good to us without a selfish
[49:00] motive that's what the thing we got to
[49:02] look at without a selfish motive he was
[49:05] good to us now those are the people
[49:07] that's going to be given eternal life
[49:09] now those that read the Bible and say I
[49:11] think I'll just be really good to these
[49:12] people because I think we I might no
[49:16] no that don't work thank you brother
[49:17] Doherty that don't work
[49:22] simple but profound that don't work
[49:25] so without controversy great is the
[49:27] mystery of godliness where is God God's
[49:29] in US all right as we were talking this
[49:32] morning
[49:33] and you're you're on the basis of free
[49:34] world agency let's continue through that
[49:36] real quick but he tells Abram to be
[49:39] perfect
[49:40] in other words lacking nothing and and
[49:43] not so much in physical strength but but
[49:45] in Christian strength
[49:47] wholesome sound complete morally
[49:50] innocent having Integrity now does that
[49:53] sound like the world today did that
[49:55] sound like that horse forehead that I
[49:57] told you about this morning no we're
[49:59] over here in that
[50:01] we're not over here
[50:04] be therefore perfect lacketh nothing
[50:08] complete in other words able to
[50:11] withstand the devil
[50:14] all right
[50:16] sound wholesome
[50:18] as brothers John was talking this
[50:20] morning
[50:20] about finances different things that
[50:23] there's got to be a and we did go
[50:24] through the Dave Ramsey course several
[50:26] years ago pretty much all of us did
[50:29] um
[50:30] but there's a there's when you see that
[50:32] Financial Peace University
[50:35] those two words really don't go together
[50:37] in the world
[50:39] Financial Peace because they don't have
[50:42] either
[50:43] but we can have Financial Peace and also
[50:46] have perfect peace because we're here
[50:49] and we listen to what God Said not what
[50:52] these people say right
[50:55] morally innocent as we were reading this
[50:58] morning morally listen morally we're
[51:01] clean
[51:03] if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:06] you're a Christian today
[51:08] you buy it as clean as you're going to
[51:10] get
[51:12] anybody with me
[51:13] I mean you say well what do you mean
[51:15] brother wait well you're not going to
[51:16] get an extra eternal life
[51:19] okay you're not gonna get an extra
[51:21] eternal life now you're gonna get extra
[51:23] gifts
[51:24] you're gonna get extra ads and you're
[51:27] going to get that Holy Spirit which
[51:28] we'll talk about later on maybe next
[51:29] weekend where it just covers over and it
[51:32] solidifies you and makes you to where
[51:35] you will not fail
[51:37] and not fall
[51:38] all right morally innocent having
[51:41] integrity
[51:42] one who is morally and ethically
[51:45] pure this world can't be that
[51:49] but what they call Pure though we call
[51:52] an unpure
[51:55] they're pure they can marry whoever they
[51:56] want to they can commit adultery they
[51:58] can divorce and they can do just
[51:59] whatever it doesn't really matter over
[52:01] here on this side
[52:02] but not on this side
[52:04] all right everybody with me there's the
[52:07] separation because I don't want to be
[52:09] judged by this
[52:11] right there will be no watch on judgment
[52:13] for this but they surely will for this
[52:15] group right here all right so godliness
[52:18] is what reverence and respect and that's
[52:20] the way we're going to get we're going
[52:21] to mold godliness into brotherly
[52:23] kindness next weekend because that's
[52:25] what brotherly kindness is it starts
[52:28] with respect
[52:31] and now remember that's all gone
[52:34] we were talking about a horse forehead
[52:35] they don't respect nothing anymore
[52:37] I mean zero they don't respect you I
[52:40] used to respect my elders I didn't care
[52:42] if I didn't like them
[52:44] I shut my mouth and listen if it was an
[52:46] older person talking
[52:48] I don't some of y'all are looking at me
[52:50] like you're crazy but I I knew that if I
[52:52] walked up and was talking to somebody or
[52:54] if an old elderly person was talking I
[52:56] didn't say nothing
[52:58] I waited till they was finished all
[53:00] right
[53:03] you say that's silly no it's respect
[53:05] it's teaching it's getting the right
[53:07] kind of teaching and man bro sister
[53:09] cleator was talking about remember
[53:10] brother Brown never said juvenile
[53:12] delinquency he never said that
[53:14] he said it was parental delinquency
[53:17] you're letting them get
[53:21] back well praise the Lord anyway
[53:23] I'm just telling you what he said
[53:26] okay so now fifthly we're adding
[53:28] godliness and we've been talking about
[53:29] it so let's continue on brother Ram
[53:30] talks about what oh brother random I
[53:32] can't do that he said oh yes you can
[53:36] oh yes you can he is saying oh I can't
[53:40] bless God I'm the prophet I've already
[53:41] done it no
[53:43] no you reading statue perfect man he
[53:45] said he said Teach Me Lord
[53:47] so that I can teach others
[53:49] all right teach me Lord so that I can
[53:51] teach others teach me Lord all of you
[53:55] so that you can teach others so that you
[53:57] can show this stature of a perfect man
[53:59] to your neighbor to your fellow
[54:01] co-workers I hope your fellow co-workers
[54:04] know that you're different
[54:07] hey man they may not like you but they
[54:10] know you're different all right
[54:12] now look when we are judged we are
[54:15] chasing of the Lord now this is over
[54:16] here that we be not condemned with the
[54:19] world which is what we've been talking
[54:20] about over on this side because we've
[54:22] been instructed that's what to me that's
[54:24] what the filefold ministry does it
[54:26] perfects the Saints it takes you from
[54:28] this condemnation I'm gonna read it to
[54:30] you in just a minute we're talking about
[54:31] the seed
[54:32] and and the planting of the seed and all
[54:34] that we'll talk about in just a second
[54:36] because I want to bring them I want to
[54:38] bring an overview that how is it going
[54:40] to help to be Godly to be Godly you
[54:43] can't do it by sitting at home listening
[54:45] to the tapes it's good to do that but
[54:48] you've got to have a five-fold Ministry
[54:50] in a in a church setting okay
[54:55] to get you this instruction
[54:58] because
[55:00] I was thinking yesterday morning
[55:03] why do we have questions and answers if
[55:05] we don't need anything
[55:07] why do we have questions
[55:09] if we don't need another man to tell us
[55:11] nothing if we don't need somebody to
[55:12] come and say hey can you clarify that
[55:14] for me
[55:15] you've done it I've done it we've all
[55:17] done it we've all come to place that God
[55:19] you're gonna have to tell me what that
[55:21] means because I really don't understand
[55:22] amen is everybody all right with that
[55:25] you come to a place you say hey I need
[55:28] some help
[55:29] if you don't then
[55:31] bless your heart
[55:33] we still gotta come to church
[55:35] you can't take that piece of the Bible
[55:37] out and throw it away
[55:38] second Peter 1 says according as his
[55:40] divine power has given unto us all
[55:42] things that what pertain unto life and
[55:44] godliness of what we've been talking
[55:45] about so the knowledge of him that's
[55:46] called us to glory and virtue so God's
[55:48] called us through some do something
[55:51] he called us to take of this divine
[55:53] nature of God or the new birth and then
[55:57] look see there it is again there's the
[55:59] separate having escaped the corruption
[56:01] that is in the world through lust this
[56:03] group over here
[56:05] you've escaped that yes
[56:09] because the divine nature of God's not
[56:11] over here
[56:13] it's over here
[56:15] and listen if you're over here
[56:20] the divine nature of God is not over
[56:22] here remember
[56:23] it's over here
[56:25] we conform to His Image we conform to
[56:28] what he tells us to do all right so
[56:31] partaking of the divine nature of having
[56:33] escaped the corruption that is in the
[56:35] world through lust and besides this
[56:36] giving all diligence add what
[56:39] so let's look at this just a minute if
[56:41] you want to turn your Bibles you can but
[56:42] Matthew 13 Verse 3 I've got it all down
[56:44] here for you and I've kind of got it
[56:46] mapped out
[56:47] because you look at the what are we
[56:49] doing today what are we doing today
[56:51] today we have come to a church to just
[56:55] be a member
[56:57] uh did we come here just to see another
[56:59] person
[57:01] uh did we come here to just hear a good
[57:05] uh exhortation or or did we come here to
[57:09] hear the word of God I mean the word of
[57:12] God not a not a a watered-down
[57:14] substitute version of the word of God so
[57:17] when Jesus is standing there he explains
[57:20] later on not in Matthew 13 but he's
[57:22] playing later on who is this sower now
[57:25] what is the sower he's the one that puts
[57:26] all the seed in his pocket and he goes
[57:28] out and he throws it right he's he's
[57:32] Distributing seed
[57:34] all right I'm a gardener uh it's not
[57:37] gonna you can't just set the bag down at
[57:39] the end of the row
[57:42] and it's back to get a line of corn
[57:45] you got to take that seed and put it in
[57:48] ground
[57:49] some kind of ground
[57:52] so let's break it down a little bit
[57:53] right here the sower is who the son of
[57:55] man or the ministry
[57:57] nobody with me we're under the ministry
[57:59] of the son of man right now all right
[58:01] the seed is not a little grain of
[58:04] something in this Parable it is that but
[58:07] it's the word of God we know that seed
[58:09] is the word we know that's that's
[58:10] everything all right that's the sermon
[58:13] you're going to hear
[58:14] get by with me all right but if you
[58:16] don't agree just say hey I don't know if
[58:17] that's right or not and the ground that
[58:19] it goes in is you
[58:22] it's not it's not that carpet it's not
[58:25] the Pew you're sitting in it's what's
[58:28] setting in the pew
[58:29] is the ground or your Earth all right so
[58:33] you got the sower the minister you've
[58:36] got the word going forth
[58:38] and you've got the ground that you
[58:42] control what kind of ground it is
[58:46] I can't
[58:48] they asked brother Brown was talking
[58:50] about yesterday at the hospital around
[58:51] said why do you keep preaching
[58:54] if if this you know in other words if
[58:56] you they thought they thought he was
[58:58] preaching predestination as just you
[59:00] know well you can nobody else can be
[59:02] saved only this amount of people and
[59:03] that's it
[59:05] he said no
[59:07] he said I still throw the net because I
[59:10] don't know who's fishing who's whose
[59:11] snakes
[59:13] he said but I when I throw the net and I
[59:15] bring the net in
[59:17] he said the snakes automatically go back
[59:20] to the water
[59:21] the fish stand the net right so he
[59:24] doesn't he didn't know if I discernment
[59:26] I'm sure he did know a lot more than any
[59:28] of us would know about who was listening
[59:30] who was not who was getting it who
[59:32] wasn't but you know what he preached
[59:34] anyway
[59:35] all right
[59:36] I never heard him stop a sermon and say
[59:38] all right y'all not getting any of this
[59:39] I'm out of here
[59:41] he did say in one sermon y'all not
[59:42] getting it but he kept on preaching
[59:44] all right so he had he was preaching to
[59:47] whom me you all of us it wasn't born at
[59:50] the time so let's go through this
[59:51] Parable just for a minute I want to help
[59:53] you cultivate
[59:56] your ground
[59:57] if y'all will wake up
[1:00:00] it will help you much more if you listen
[1:00:03] before falling asleep
[1:00:05] Matthew 13 verse 3.
[1:00:10] and he spake many things unto them in
[1:00:13] Parables saying behold A sower went
[1:00:16] forth to sow so so a preacher
[1:00:19] or a minister is going to throw or
[1:00:24] broadcast that's what the word so means
[1:00:26] it means to broadcast
[1:00:28] seed all right so it's got to be
[1:00:31] broadcast like I said he can't stay in
[1:00:33] his bag he can't stand a little bag it
[1:00:35] comes in from the from the store it's
[1:00:39] got to be broadcast by somebody
[1:00:41] and now you got to know where to throw
[1:00:44] it too
[1:00:45] all right and you got to know where to
[1:00:47] put it
[1:00:48] so you got to be skilled in what you're
[1:00:50] doing you don't just walk out there now
[1:00:52] sometimes if you were planting flowers
[1:00:54] and stuff you might but if you're
[1:00:55] planting a garden uh you know I map out
[1:00:57] everything don't know me I'm mapping
[1:01:00] everything out I mean I got
[1:01:02] six rows of corn
[1:01:04] because see
[1:01:05] and this is the way I think God does
[1:01:08] I got six rows of corn but now the the
[1:01:11] not the almanac but
[1:01:13] but you know what common sense will tell
[1:01:15] you that if you're growing something
[1:01:16] this tall Danny you don't want to grow
[1:01:18] something this tall beside it
[1:01:20] off the sun side
[1:01:23] because it don't grow good in shade
[1:01:25] so you don't want to plant beans corn
[1:01:28] and the sun come up over there
[1:01:30] now if the sun comes up over there you
[1:01:32] want to plant beans and then corn
[1:01:33] because it one of them grows higher than
[1:01:35] the other one all right then by with me
[1:01:37] so they see that's almost like a Master
[1:01:38] Builders the Bible tells us that we are
[1:01:41] if we're Ministers of the Gospel we know
[1:01:44] where to put the seed all right we know
[1:01:47] where it needs to go
[1:01:49] and by the by the Holy Ghost I I hope
[1:01:52] and pray and I don't say this
[1:01:54] frivolously I hope and pray that it's
[1:01:56] done by the Holy Ghost every service
[1:01:58] that anybody stands up here that the
[1:02:01] Holy Ghost leads and takes over you get
[1:02:03] the mind of what's going on somewhere
[1:02:05] else you don't get it right here a lot
[1:02:07] of times you get it somewhere else but
[1:02:10] it always hits your row
[1:02:14] kind of tough that we're all planted in
[1:02:15] roads right now
[1:02:17] hmm row by row
[1:02:19] and when he sowed
[1:02:22] so when he ministered the word
[1:02:25] some word fell by the wayside
[1:02:29] and the fowls came and devoured them up
[1:02:32] there's a lot that's going to happen in
[1:02:33] this sermon you'll never remember a day
[1:02:35] in your life
[1:02:37] from this day forward
[1:02:39] unless you need it
[1:02:41] but if you need it
[1:02:46] we'll keep reading
[1:02:48] some fell what some some of them some of
[1:02:51] the ministry some of the some of the
[1:02:53] word
[1:02:55] fell upon Stony places
[1:02:58] you walked in here with an attitude
[1:03:02] you walked in here with a Stony heart
[1:03:05] he walked in here with an odd against
[1:03:07] your brother or sister
[1:03:10] I'm telling you folks because this this
[1:03:12] seed planting is planting to the seed of
[1:03:14] the Kingdom Children of the kingdom
[1:03:16] whose Children of the Kingdom right
[1:03:18] so this is not worldly people this is
[1:03:20] what you bring into this service every
[1:03:24] Sunday every Wednesday you bring some
[1:03:27] kind of ground
[1:03:30] you either bring Stony ground you either
[1:03:33] bring thorny ground
[1:03:36] and all haven't we met some of those
[1:03:37] people
[1:03:38] some fell upon Stony places
[1:03:41] where they had not much Earth
[1:03:45] and forthwith they sprung up but because
[1:03:47] they had no deepness
[1:03:50] of Earth
[1:03:52] you really didn't take it
[1:03:54] the way you should have
[1:03:57] and Satan is going to steal
[1:04:00] your Victory from that
[1:04:02] and when the sun was up
[1:04:05] they were scorched
[1:04:07] have we been scorched a few times in
[1:04:09] sermons well I'll raise mine you can
[1:04:11] raise yours if you want to
[1:04:12] I was scorched by the Sun the s-o-n amen
[1:04:16] we need that a lot you know it's kind of
[1:04:18] it's kind of a fine line you want the
[1:04:20] sun to come up your plants are not going
[1:04:22] to survive without sunlight but if they
[1:04:24] get too much sunlight it'll burn them
[1:04:27] and kill them
[1:04:28] all right so when the sun was up they
[1:04:30] were scorched and because they had no
[1:04:32] root
[1:04:35] because you didn't do the little things
[1:04:39] because remember Roots you can't see
[1:04:43] anybody with me Roots you can't see
[1:04:46] they're in the ground but they but what
[1:04:48] comes up out of the ground is a
[1:04:50] production of what the life is in that
[1:04:51] root
[1:04:53] same way with us am I getting somewhere
[1:04:55] same way with us all right when the sun
[1:04:57] was up there was coursed and because
[1:04:59] they had no root they withered away and
[1:05:00] died
[1:05:02] and some fell among thorns
[1:05:06] our attitude
[1:05:09] and the Thorns just sprang up and choked
[1:05:12] them
[1:05:13] who's them us
[1:05:17] but other fell
[1:05:19] in good ground
[1:05:22] today you may walk out and say I didn't
[1:05:24] get a thing that wasn't for me he was he
[1:05:27] was talking uh about me he was you know
[1:05:30] you can be all a thorny as you want to
[1:05:32] but you can also say hey man that was
[1:05:34] good ground
[1:05:35] that was really good ground because me
[1:05:38] planting a garden
[1:05:40] I try to find the best ground I can to
[1:05:43] get the thing because you want the best
[1:05:44] opportunity to get something to grow
[1:05:46] well I want the best opportunity here to
[1:05:48] get something to grow
[1:05:50] all right so that's why you try to lay
[1:05:52] out the fertilizer that may not be too
[1:05:54] well you lay out the fertilizer
[1:05:57] all right
[1:05:58] you get the best soil you can find and
[1:06:01] then you water it
[1:06:04] but look but other fell on good ground
[1:06:07] and brought forth fruit now wait a
[1:06:09] minute all these other ones didn't bring
[1:06:11] forth no fruit
[1:06:13] never made it to a full stature of a
[1:06:16] plant
[1:06:17] yet they had potential
[1:06:20] Jesus didn't say now I picked up some
[1:06:22] seed in this bag and then the next
[1:06:23] people I picked up in it he said no the
[1:06:26] seed is the word of God
[1:06:29] all right so it's one word that goes out
[1:06:32] whether you take it or not or you can
[1:06:34] let it roll off your back I like what
[1:06:36] one Minister said one time he said he
[1:06:38] said now if we're sowing seed and said
[1:06:40] if you're not accepting that said it
[1:06:41] just bounced on top of you and just
[1:06:43] bounce over onto your neighbor and maybe
[1:06:45] he'll get a good blessing out of it now
[1:06:47] that's the way it is you know because
[1:06:49] you say well that wasn't for me and that
[1:06:51] other person said beside you well it was
[1:06:52] for me well what happened was you had
[1:06:55] some Stony ground Maybe
[1:06:57] if you throw the Australian seed
[1:06:59] yesterday I'm just going to repent
[1:07:02] I stolen seed yesterday in planting my
[1:07:05] uh uh Fort lima beans and their big old
[1:07:08] beans well yeah you know you put like
[1:07:10] two to a hill well I'm standing here
[1:07:12] putting two and them things bounce like
[1:07:14] rubber
[1:07:17] I'm sorry
[1:07:18] they just bounce right out of the a
[1:07:20] couple of them just bounced right out of
[1:07:21] there why because of hard ground
[1:07:24] now I have some soft ground over here
[1:07:26] that was real didn't have any rocks in
[1:07:28] it at all them little seeds just went
[1:07:30] blue
[1:07:32] two by two
[1:07:33] but when I started over here I put one
[1:07:35] and it would literally bounce a foot all
[1:07:37] out of the out of the furrow yeah
[1:07:39] brother John I was a little bit ill
[1:07:40] about it
[1:07:42] because I'm like come on I'm dropping
[1:07:44] them around here well they'd hit they'd
[1:07:46] hit something Stony and guess what
[1:07:48] out it went
[1:07:50] so I had to reach them God has the
[1:07:54] reaching every once in a while and get
[1:07:55] us out of our mess and put us back in a
[1:07:57] row that we need to be in all right but
[1:08:00] other fell in good ground and brought
[1:08:01] forth fruit some hundredfold 60 and 30.
[1:08:04] wow what a what a production rate all
[1:08:07] right who has ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:08:09] the disciples came and said why speak
[1:08:11] with you in parables he said unto them
[1:08:14] because it is given unto you to you so
[1:08:17] now who is this given to you to know the
[1:08:19] mystery of the Kingdom
[1:08:21] so it's given to who us sitting in abuse
[1:08:23] us sitting in a rose today
[1:08:25] it's it it's it's given to us
[1:08:28] to know the Mysteries of what godliness
[1:08:32] brotherly kindness Faith virtue
[1:08:35] knowledge not like the world but like
[1:08:38] God said
[1:08:39] right
[1:08:41] but to them it is not given so
[1:08:44] whatever's going forth how many times
[1:08:46] have I told you I was thinking about
[1:08:48] this when I when I had got this thought
[1:08:50] here I thought man
[1:08:53] just bring a whole group of people with
[1:08:54] you y'all invite a couple of your
[1:08:56] friends from work or or you or some of
[1:08:59] your family that ain't born again or
[1:09:00] some of your family that's good bring
[1:09:01] them in here let them sit and listen for
[1:09:03] about a service
[1:09:05] they won't know half what we're talking
[1:09:07] about
[1:09:09] and the other half they're like no way
[1:09:11] man
[1:09:12] no y'all a cult
[1:09:15] y'all don't know what you're talking
[1:09:16] about and you can read it to them right
[1:09:18] out black and white out of the Bible
[1:09:20] and they're like no that ain't it why
[1:09:23] because they're over here they got a
[1:09:24] horse forehead
[1:09:26] you're not going to teach me anything
[1:09:27] this is the way it is
[1:09:29] but then you got us over here that's in
[1:09:31] good ground
[1:09:33] amen
[1:09:34] see therefore I speak to you whosoever
[1:09:36] hath to him shall be given and he shall
[1:09:39] have more abundance these people but
[1:09:41] whosoever hath not for him shall be
[1:09:44] taken away even what he's got
[1:09:49] the joy is lifted off to be put on you
[1:09:54] wow think about that
[1:09:57] God's Gonna protect his kids
[1:09:59] amen God's going to protect his kids
[1:10:02] he's not going to give a glory or give
[1:10:04] an honor to somebody don't deserve it
[1:10:06] God's not that way he's a righteous
[1:10:07] judge
[1:10:10] but the Bible tells us we're Kings and
[1:10:12] Priests
[1:10:13] not this group listen they're worthy to
[1:10:17] rule their Cosmos
[1:10:19] they're worthy to rule Satan's Eden
[1:10:22] praise the Lord but not us we've been
[1:10:25] called out of that and now we rule as
[1:10:28] Kings and Priests and the kingdom of God
[1:10:34] think about that
[1:10:36] there is nothing
[1:10:38] on this side
[1:10:40] it's going to carry into another
[1:10:41] dimension except number five
[1:10:48] we have no continuing City
[1:10:50] this is not continuing over here this
[1:10:53] over here is a
[1:10:55] future home
[1:10:56] this is an eternal City that we're going
[1:10:58] to
[1:10:59] therefore speak unto them in parables
[1:11:02] and that's what it would be if you and I
[1:11:04] were preaching today and a group of
[1:11:05] people comes in from another place they
[1:11:07] would say what is this great mystery
[1:11:10] what is this Parable that you're that
[1:11:12] you're speaking you you speak things
[1:11:13] that we don't understand and you know
[1:11:15] why because they don't have the Holy
[1:11:16] Ghost just like
[1:11:17] at this moment
[1:11:19] those disciples didn't have the baptism
[1:11:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:24] so they didn't have anything for the
[1:11:26] Quicken
[1:11:27] but it was potential they held all this
[1:11:29] in their heart and I promise you on a
[1:11:31] day of Pentecost that thereafter they
[1:11:33] knew what God was talking about they
[1:11:35] knew what Jesus was talking about when
[1:11:36] he's talking about sowing the seed
[1:11:39] and then them is fulfilled the prophecy
[1:11:42] of Isaiah which says by hearing you
[1:11:44] shall hear and shall not
[1:11:47] understand
[1:11:50] and seeing you shall see
[1:11:52] and you shall not perceive
[1:11:55] you can talk to them to the blue in the
[1:11:57] face but unless you decide to put
[1:11:59] yourself in good ground
[1:12:01] it's just going to be like rocks it's
[1:12:03] going to just bounce off of you it's
[1:12:04] going to dry you up it's going to blow
[1:12:06] you away and you're just gonna
[1:12:09] I don't say be lost but you're just
[1:12:11] going to have I want Victory there's too
[1:12:13] much defeat going on I want some victory
[1:12:16] all right well don't stay over here
[1:12:20] this is all defeated every bit of it
[1:12:22] there's not even a little bright spot
[1:12:24] nowhere
[1:12:26] over here is Albright
[1:12:28] all right so let's transfer
[1:12:31] ourselves over to there let it be your
[1:12:34] choice
[1:12:35] and in them it's fulfilled the prophet
[1:12:37] talking about hearing they shall not
[1:12:39] understand seeing they shall not
[1:12:41] perceive for this people's heart
[1:12:44] is waxed gross and their ears are dull
[1:12:47] of hearing and their eyes
[1:12:50] they just closed them
[1:12:53] have you ever seen you start talking to
[1:12:54] somebody and you talk to them about the
[1:12:56] true word of God or you talk to them
[1:12:57] even just about living good they don't
[1:12:59] literally close their eyes but you know
[1:13:01] they've just closed it off
[1:13:04] some of y'all do the same thing here
[1:13:06] if you don't like what's going on you
[1:13:08] just close her off
[1:13:12] well praise the Lord anyhow
[1:13:15] but the seeds being sown it's according
[1:13:18] to what ground you brought not mine
[1:13:20] yours what corner what ground you
[1:13:22] brought it was going to get in today
[1:13:25] all right
[1:13:26] for this people's heart is wax gross and
[1:13:29] their ears are dull of hearing in their
[1:13:30] eyes they just close them lest at any
[1:13:33] time look less than any time they should
[1:13:35] see with their eyes and hear with their
[1:13:37] ear and be in other words converted
[1:13:40] that's what he says converted people are
[1:13:43] afraid of being converted
[1:13:48] tell me tell me that's a lie it's not
[1:13:51] people are afraid when you start telling
[1:13:56] tell me about the religion stuff I might
[1:13:58] have to change
[1:14:00] and then even the ones that are
[1:14:02] religious that we talked to horse
[1:14:03] forehead this morning even those are
[1:14:04] religious and hey don't talk to me about
[1:14:06] this cutting hair business God doesn't
[1:14:08] mind I said well he wrote it in his
[1:14:10] Bible
[1:14:11] hey you don't talk to me about it talk
[1:14:13] to God about it okay all right
[1:14:17] if not you'll stay over here
[1:14:19] and you'll close your eyes and you'll
[1:14:21] close your ears
[1:14:24] listen
[1:14:26] and should understand with their heart
[1:14:28] look at less than any time
[1:14:31] they should see with their eyes and hear
[1:14:33] with their ears you know that was the
[1:14:35] problem with the Rich Young Ruler the
[1:14:36] Rich Young Ruler was like hey I've done
[1:14:38] it all
[1:14:40] I've done every bit of it
[1:14:43] Jesus said you lack one little thing and
[1:14:47] do you know that one thing put him in
[1:14:49] hell right
[1:14:52] come on somebody that one thing he
[1:14:55] couldn't do put him in hell
[1:14:57] not all the good stuff not all that
[1:14:59] other Ten Commandments we kept he said
[1:15:02] I've kept it from my youth
[1:15:05] Jesus said your lacketh one thing
[1:15:08] sell everything you got and follow me
[1:15:11] all followed no because no now Jesus you
[1:15:14] got a reputation I I've got a reputation
[1:15:16] and you've got a reputation I'm sure not
[1:15:18] going to give up my reputation to go
[1:15:20] with your reputation that's what he was
[1:15:22] saying
[1:15:23] and Jesus was just like
[1:15:25] sorry I can't do you no good and then
[1:15:27] the Bible tells us that we're handed up
[1:15:30] he ended up in hell
[1:15:32] and should understand so people are
[1:15:34] afraid less than any time they should
[1:15:36] see with their eyes here with their ears
[1:15:37] and shouldn't understand where the heart
[1:15:38] and should be converted and I should
[1:15:40] what
[1:15:41] kill them
[1:15:42] that's spiritual healing not so much
[1:15:45] natural healing there's people in this
[1:15:47] message that scared the death of this
[1:15:49] statue of perfect man if not they would
[1:15:50] preach it
[1:15:54] for those of you that are awake there
[1:15:57] are people that are scared of the Statue
[1:15:59] of perfect man because they have to live
[1:16:01] a different life than the normal I'm
[1:16:05] talking about normal message life
[1:16:07] there's a higher plane we're saying what
[1:16:10] lead me on to Higher Ground
[1:16:13] not just the ground that I had the seed
[1:16:16] planted in
[1:16:17] you know I the seed I planted the other
[1:16:19] day several weeks from now it's going to
[1:16:21] come up but you know what I'm going to
[1:16:22] do I'm not going to walk away from it
[1:16:24] I'm going to still make sure it's
[1:16:24] watered and I'm still going to fertilize
[1:16:26] it I'm still going to take care of it
[1:16:28] through the whole process till I get
[1:16:30] some good beans out of it and some good
[1:16:33] corn I'm going to be with it the whole
[1:16:35] time all right same way with the Lord
[1:16:37] he's with it the whole time through the
[1:16:39] ministry through the five-fold ministry
[1:16:41] he watches you go from what stock or
[1:16:44] shoot to stock
[1:16:46] corn ear and full maturity all right and
[1:16:51] I should heal them but blessed are your
[1:16:53] eyes
[1:16:55] come on blessed are your eyes for they
[1:16:58] see
[1:17:00] and your ears for their hair
[1:17:03] for barely I say unto you that many
[1:17:05] prophets
[1:17:06] and righteous men have desired to see
[1:17:10] the things you see and I'm talking about
[1:17:11] us today 2023
[1:17:14] because you and I have fulfillment of
[1:17:16] every prophet in the Bible
[1:17:20] they were only looking for the Messiah
[1:17:25] and he was sitting there and they didn't
[1:17:27] know who he was
[1:17:28] okay and rejected him and killed him now
[1:17:31] you and I are passed out
[1:17:33] if we don't reject him
[1:17:35] we're past that so we take what Jeremiah
[1:17:38] says Isaiah says uh Matthew and uh Mark
[1:17:43] and Lou and John and uh
[1:17:45] Paul and uh Peter and uh everybody
[1:17:49] understand what I'm saying we've got all
[1:17:51] that they didn't when they were sitting
[1:17:52] here listening to Jesus they had the Old
[1:17:54] Testament and that was it
[1:17:58] which was some of the Major Prophets
[1:18:00] but he said blessed are your eyes for
[1:18:03] they see
[1:18:04] and your ears for they hear for Valley I
[1:18:06] say unto you that many prophets and
[1:18:08] righteous men have desired to see these
[1:18:10] things you see and have not seen them
[1:18:13] and to hear those things which you hear
[1:18:16] and have not heard them
[1:18:17] hear ye therefore the parable
[1:18:20] of the sower now he's fixing to break it
[1:18:22] down a little more for him okay
[1:18:24] when anyone Hearth the word of the
[1:18:27] kingdom and understandeth it not then
[1:18:30] cometh the wicked one catch us away that
[1:18:33] which was sown in his heart
[1:18:36] now you say oh now brother wait that you
[1:18:39] you said this morning you can't lose
[1:18:40] your Holy Ghost you can't lose the Holy
[1:18:42] Ghost but remember you gotta look at
[1:18:44] this heart
[1:18:45] remember Ezekiel you get
[1:18:48] two parts of a heart
[1:18:50] anybody with me
[1:18:53] he softens up that old Stony heart so he
[1:18:57] can then birth you if you continue on
[1:18:59] right amen remember then he puts his
[1:19:03] Spirit into your heart to make it soft
[1:19:06] and pliable
[1:19:08] that's not this is talking about
[1:19:11] catches away that which was sown in his
[1:19:14] heart
[1:19:15] because a lot of people come to
[1:19:16] sanctification and they can't go any
[1:19:18] further
[1:19:20] because if they have a heart condition
[1:19:24] this is he which received seed by the
[1:19:27] wayside but he that receiveth what the
[1:19:30] word
[1:19:31] the ministry into Stony places the same
[1:19:35] as he that heareth the word now here we
[1:19:37] go hear that hear it the message
[1:19:40] hear it the minister
[1:19:42] and Anon will Joy receiving
[1:19:45] that was a sermon Hallelujah
[1:19:48] that was good praise the Lord Regina our
[1:19:51] line was dancing she was whooping and
[1:19:53] hollering
[1:19:57] but Monday morning
[1:20:01] Monday morning
[1:20:06] and yet he hath not rooted in himself
[1:20:08] what is root grounded that puts you in
[1:20:10] there and keeps you in the The Roots is
[1:20:13] vitally important to keep you upright
[1:20:16] you lose your roots you fall right
[1:20:19] somebody you lose your roots you fall
[1:20:23] and yet he has no root in him but
[1:20:25] endureth for a little while
[1:20:29] Monday
[1:20:31] Tuesday
[1:20:34] Wednesday
[1:20:36] for those of you that don't come to
[1:20:37] church it just keeps getting worse
[1:20:43] for when tribulation and persecution
[1:20:45] arise because of the word
[1:20:48] how are you condemned you're not
[1:20:49] condemned by the world you're condemned
[1:20:51] by the word
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:53] by and by He Is offended
[1:20:57] hmm
[1:20:59] happens a lot doesn't it
[1:21:01] you get offended people get offended and
[1:21:04] out of here
[1:21:09] I'm just reading what the Bible says
[1:21:11] he also that receives seed or the word
[1:21:15] among Thorns is he that heareth the word
[1:21:23] and the cares
[1:21:26] of this world
[1:21:28] well I got to stay home come with cat's
[1:21:30] sick
[1:21:31] I gotta stay home because I got friends
[1:21:33] coming in yeah your friends can go by in
[1:21:36] the house by yourself by their cell
[1:21:37] phone Sunday you coming to church
[1:21:40] but most y'all don't do that so
[1:21:42] but you're you're killing your testimony
[1:21:44] this whole thing about a statue of
[1:21:46] perfect man to me is testimony
[1:21:48] it's all about a testimony it's about
[1:21:51] the world seeing that you live different
[1:21:53] than they do
[1:21:54] and the reason you live different is
[1:21:56] because not you're not better you
[1:21:57] weren't born in a in a in a in a
[1:22:00] hospital that was totally sanitized no
[1:22:03] we were all born the exact same way
[1:22:07] born in sin shaping iniquity but we have
[1:22:10] come to a place where we heard the word
[1:22:12] of God it sparked something in our heart
[1:22:14] then we said God now now I want to live
[1:22:19] different
[1:22:20] you gotta want to live different if you
[1:22:23] don't you're gonna be in this group
[1:22:24] right over here
[1:22:25] because it's easy to be in this group
[1:22:27] right over here because 99 of the
[1:22:29] world's in this group right here
[1:22:31] you got to be that one percent that's
[1:22:34] over here that takes trials and
[1:22:36] tribulations
[1:22:38] and counts it all joy
[1:22:44] when you fall into divers diverse many
[1:22:48] Temptations
[1:22:51] seems like these people over here they
[1:22:52] just everything's good yeah everything's
[1:22:55] good for a moment doesn't the Bible say
[1:22:56] sin for a season
[1:22:58] you just gotta season the time
[1:23:01] what are you going to do for that time
[1:23:03] this time down here is just a very short
[1:23:04] period of your real life
[1:23:07] everybody with me
[1:23:09] okay well let's think about it then how
[1:23:11] we live our life here
[1:23:12] he also that receives seed among the
[1:23:15] Thorns is he that Hearth the word
[1:23:17] and the character what does the thorn do
[1:23:20] number one a thorn does are a weed does
[1:23:24] it takes and it doesn't actually kill
[1:23:27] the plant unless you let it get big
[1:23:29] enough and it'll choke it what does it
[1:23:31] do though
[1:23:33] it takes the nutrients that you're
[1:23:35] supposed to get
[1:23:37] and it puts it in something that don't
[1:23:40] produce
[1:23:42] because remember the rainfall was going
[1:23:44] to just in the unjust
[1:23:45] that same rain that gives it to the to
[1:23:48] the plants the same one it gives it
[1:23:50] that's why we try to we
[1:23:52] weed our garden or you need to weed
[1:23:55] around your trees if you've got some
[1:23:56] trees that want to grow get all the
[1:23:58] other little trees out from under it get
[1:24:00] all the little trees away from it
[1:24:02] because they're sucking nutrients out of
[1:24:03] the ground
[1:24:05] I mean that's just International but
[1:24:07] same thing in the spiritual are you
[1:24:08] letting somebody or something suck your
[1:24:11] life out of you
[1:24:12] and it's going to be a non-producer
[1:24:16] if it's thank you every time it'll be a
[1:24:19] non-producer there is no time in my life
[1:24:23] that I've ever had a garden and I look
[1:24:25] and see that this Thorn comes up and
[1:24:27] we've got thorns on it and all of a
[1:24:30] sudden
[1:24:31] there's corn on it
[1:24:34] no
[1:24:35] it is
[1:24:36] that plant
[1:24:38] it's not going to change now by the
[1:24:40] transforming power of God you change
[1:24:43] but by the transforming power of God you
[1:24:46] change not you
[1:24:47] you're still a kookaburra until he puts
[1:24:50] that weak life in you all right and
[1:24:52] cares of the world and deceitfulness of
[1:24:54] Rich look the deceitfulness of riches
[1:24:57] chokes the word
[1:25:00] and he becomes Not Dead
[1:25:05] unfruitful
[1:25:07] that's why I do pluck all that stuff out
[1:25:09] from around my beans and potatoes
[1:25:11] because listen
[1:25:12] the more you get away from them that
[1:25:15] more nutrition is going to go into your
[1:25:17] plant
[1:25:18] come on somebody it's going to come into
[1:25:20] your plant instead of getting two pieces
[1:25:22] of corn off of the stock you get three
[1:25:24] or four
[1:25:25] hundredfold 64 34.
[1:25:28] it's because of the nutrition that you
[1:25:30] get in the
[1:25:32] roots
[1:25:34] and don't let somebody besides you suck
[1:25:37] all that
[1:25:39] popcorn
[1:25:43] s people all the time
[1:25:46] but if they're non-seed
[1:25:49] as brother Ram said there's nothing to
[1:25:50] Quicken
[1:25:52] non-seed is non-seed
[1:25:54] let God work that out though you want
[1:25:57] you want him
[1:25:58] you want them by the transforming power
[1:26:00] of God you want them to come over here
[1:26:01] and become corn but if they decide
[1:26:06] and they're going to be a thorn in your
[1:26:07] side
[1:26:12] the deceitfulness of riches chokes the
[1:26:15] word
[1:26:16] and he becomes unfruitful
[1:26:19] but he that receive a seed in good
[1:26:21] ground
[1:26:22] if you come in this morning and said
[1:26:24] Lord
[1:26:25] forgive me of what I've done this week
[1:26:28] if you want a good formula
[1:26:31] every time you before you walk in that
[1:26:33] door repent I don't care if you've been
[1:26:34] asleep for three days
[1:26:37] you've had a dirty thought in there
[1:26:38] somewhere
[1:26:40] and actually if you've been asleep for
[1:26:41] three days and somebody wakes you up
[1:26:42] you're gonna have a problem with a
[1:26:43] person to wake you up so anyway
[1:26:46] right
[1:26:48] so there's your problem repent
[1:26:51] repent before you come through the door
[1:26:54] just repent
[1:26:56] then you can receive you know what
[1:26:57] you've done by the transforming power of
[1:26:59] God you've took the thorns and killed
[1:27:01] them you've took all the rocks out of
[1:27:04] your garden
[1:27:05] God has and guess what
[1:27:08] good
[1:27:10] furled oh I love the good smell of
[1:27:12] furrowed ground
[1:27:14] I love it man you go out there and smell
[1:27:16] it and it's a smell that it to most
[1:27:19] people it don't smell worth anything but
[1:27:21] man I know the difference in the smell
[1:27:23] of good ground and clay
[1:27:25] and all that other kind of soil and I
[1:27:27] know a lot of you do too that that raise
[1:27:30] uh you know you get that potting soil as
[1:27:32] soon as you open the bag you go oh man
[1:27:38] I'm fixing to eat this but I'm not
[1:27:42] I'm not I'm gonna eat it when it becomes
[1:27:44] a plant you know it comes up through my
[1:27:45] plant and becomes a tomato
[1:27:48] or whatever you want to say but but but
[1:27:50] hey that's where that's where you your
[1:27:53] plant gets your nutrition
[1:27:54] it's from that
[1:27:57] but he that receives a seed in good
[1:27:58] ground
[1:27:59] I've come today Lord
[1:28:01] Furrow my life out
[1:28:04] plant some good seed
[1:28:06] and then let me work on it Monday into
[1:28:10] help me work on it Monday so that a
[1:28:12] thorn don't
[1:28:14] don't come in there and choke me out
[1:28:16] or help me that that there's no Stony
[1:28:19] heart there's no bitterness
[1:28:22] um I'm telling you brotherly kindness

[1:28:47] eye and a tooth for a tooth he said but
[1:28:48] I say unto you now
[1:28:50] if they smack you on no that cheek reach
[1:28:53] over and give them the other one
[1:28:56] if a man wants your coat give him your
[1:28:58] cloak in other words your shirt and your
[1:29:01] coat
[1:29:02] that's receiving seed into good ground
[1:29:05] is he that heareth the word look and
[1:29:08] understandeth it
[1:29:10] wow
[1:29:11] which also bears fruit this is the only
[1:29:14] time in this Parable that something has
[1:29:17] grown enough to give fruit but when it
[1:29:20] brings fruit it doesn't just bring one
[1:29:22] apple
[1:29:23] thousands of apples hundredfold 60 and
[1:29:28] some
[1:29:29] 30. we've already been I think I've got

[1:32:45] of the two

[1:32:49] for them which despitefully use you and
[1:32:53] uh persecute you and don't be praying
[1:32:57] Lord take this person out of the way
[1:33:03] please get rid of this person
[1:33:06] Lord you can do it
[1:33:09] he might get rid of you
[1:33:12] you might be the one that's in the way
[1:33:16] I'm telling you though I'm not trying to
[1:33:18] give you a but this is a new doctrine
[1:33:20] this is a new commandment
[1:33:22] that ye may be the children of your
[1:33:24] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:33:26] his son derives on the evil and on the
[1:33:28] good and sendeth rain on the just and
[1:33:30] the unjust for if you love them which
[1:33:32] love you what reward have you
[1:33:36] easy to love somebody loves you
[1:33:42] do not even
[1:33:45] the publicans do the same
[1:33:47] if you salute your brethren only
[1:33:52] have you ever been shunned
[1:33:56] how does it feel
[1:34:00] then stop shunning others
[1:34:04] told y'all this is gonna get rough when
[1:34:05] you get to brother Connors brother rhyme
[1:34:07] does make a quote and I'll quote it to
[1:34:08] you next week where he says you get all
[1:34:10] the way up here and then God requires
[1:34:11] you
[1:34:12] to have brotherly kindness
[1:34:15] and if you salute your brother only
[1:34:18] what do you more than others
[1:34:20] do not even Republicans do the same
[1:34:23] thing then he wraps this whole thing up
[1:34:26] this whole sermon with be therefore
[1:34:30] perfect
[1:34:31] even as your father in Heaven
[1:34:34] is perfect
[1:34:36] I'm gonna read you one quote come on uh
[1:34:38] let's stand our feet brother uh bring
[1:34:39] the musicians with you
[1:34:45] oh here's brother Brown this is 1956
[1:34:47] Divine love and Sovereign Grace we'll
[1:34:49] back up to all this in a minute
[1:34:53] now we are faced in a day now this is
[1:34:56] 1956. all right 1956. I mean people
[1:34:59] would even would would wave at you in
[1:35:01] 1956.
[1:35:03] not with the middle finger either
[1:35:06] now we are faced in a day that is
[1:35:08] prophesied to us that Brotherly Love
[1:35:10] would become a strange thing among
[1:35:12] people
[1:35:13] and it's to my humble belief that that
[1:35:16] is the greatest of all the gifts there
[1:35:19] is in God's Bible
[1:35:22] if the Lord Jesus this is Brother
[1:35:25] Branham the prophet of the end time
[1:35:27] if the Lord Jesus should stand on the
[1:35:30] platform tonight look me in the face and
[1:35:31] say I'm going to give you your choice
[1:35:34] you can be a great person a great
[1:35:36] Minister I'll give you a gift of
[1:35:37] preaching the gospel or I'll give you
[1:35:39] the gift of teaching the word or I'll
[1:35:41] give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll
[1:35:43] give you the gift of prophets prophecy
[1:35:45] or I'll make you a prophet or any of the
[1:35:46] fine Gifts of Faith any of the gift
[1:35:49] that's in the Bible I'll give them every
[1:35:50] one to you but then I will withhold love
[1:35:53] from you or either give you love and
[1:35:55] we'll hold the gift
[1:35:57] I'd say Lord take all these gifts and
[1:35:59] let me have the love
[1:36:02] for no matter how many gifts we got they
[1:36:05] will never do us any good except the
[1:36:07] love of God is the motive behind the
[1:36:11] gift
[1:36:12] we must have
[1:36:14] love
[1:36:16] must have
[1:36:19] love
[1:36:20] we'll read it next Sunday there'll be
[1:36:22] there's one where brother Brown said
[1:36:23] that's the greatest gift and they just
[1:36:25] talk he's saying it right here it's the
[1:36:26] greatest gift I have Give Me Love
[1:36:29] unfeigned love for the Brethren that's
[1:36:31] what Paul said let's sing a song God
