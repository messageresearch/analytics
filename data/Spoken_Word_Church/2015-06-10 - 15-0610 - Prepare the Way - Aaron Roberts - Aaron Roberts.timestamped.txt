[29:27] speak tonight Lord but it takes you to
[29:29] come and speak I can't do it in myself
[29:33] but we're realizing we just have a gift
[29:35] to just get ourselves out of the way and
[29:37] that you can come and and Lord you told
[29:41] us that the people just operate the gift
[29:43] Lord we just come and Lord they pulled

[29:52] the inspiration the anointing to speak
[29:54] Lord we can speak whatever has whatever
[29:56] the needs are Lord whatever the
[29:58] questions are Lord and we just believe
[30:00] that and we just rest in that this
[30:02] evening we just pray for each one that's
[30:04] not here Lord we just pray for Brother

[30:09] touch him and and be with him Lord and
[30:11] lift him up and for each prayer request
[30:14] Lord each one that's been represented by
[30:16] the uplifted hand Lord there's so many
[30:18] that Lord you're still on the scene

[30:22] still taking care of us and Lord you
[30:24] helped us get out of bed this morning
[30:25] and and get on our way and you took us
[30:27] through our our jobs and our
[30:30] responsibilities through the day and
[30:31] Lord you know we know that the scripture
[30:34] tells us that the the devil is is
[30:36] seeking whom he may devour Lord but we
[30:38] know that the angels of God encamped
[30:39] about us and Lord no matter what we do
[30:42] we know that you're there and you just
[30:43] take care of us and we're so thankful
[30:45] for that even many times Lord we're not
[30:47] even thinking and not realizing just how
[30:50] present you are with us and we just want
[30:52] to be more mindful that you're with us
[30:54] and that you're there to help us and
[30:56] lead us if we just trust in you
[30:58] and Lord we just commit all things to
[31:00] you in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[31:02] amen amen amen Isaiah
[31:05] 57 and we're going to begin verse 10 and
[31:10] and the scripture says Thou Art
[31:13] wearied in the greatness of thy way yet
[31:15] sest thou
[31:18] not there is no hope thou Hast found the
[31:22] life of thine hand therefore thou was
[31:25] not grieved and of whom Hast thou been
[31:29] afraid or feared thou Hast lied and Hast
[31:32] not remembered me nor laid it to thy
[31:35] heart have not I held my peace even of
[31:38] old and thou fearest me not I will
[31:41] declare my righteous and thy works for
[31:45] they shall not profit thee when thou
[31:47] criest let thy companies deliver thee
[31:49] but the wind shall carry them all away
[31:51] vanity shall take them but he that
[31:54] putteth his trust in me shall possess
[31:56] the land and shall inherit my ho
[31:58] mountain and shall say cast ye up cast
[32:00] you up prepare the way take up the
[32:02] stumbling block out of the way of my
[32:04] people for thus sayth the high and lofty
[32:07] one that inhabit inhabiteth
[32:10] eternity whose name is Holy I will dwell
[32:12] in the high and holy place with him also
[32:17] that is of a contrite and humble Spirit
[32:19] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[32:21] to revive the heart of the contrite ones
[32:24] for I will not contend forever neither
[32:27] will I
[32:28] be always WTH for the spirit shall fail
[32:30] before me and the Souls which I have
[32:33] made right amen and now we're going to
[32:35] go I think Brother Anderson got it wrong
[32:38] he put Luke 9ine and Luke 9 says and
[32:41] when he called his 12 disciples together
[32:43] he gave them power and authority over
[32:45] all diseases all over all Devils to cure
[32:48] diseases right amen but now the place
[32:51] that I want to read from is going to be
[32:53] Luke chapter
[32:55] 19 cuz I wrote I put 19 on there but he
[32:58] he must have so anyway we're going to go
[33:00] to Luke 19 let me read that right quick
[33:03] and uh but I mean am man he did give us
[33:06] power over all powers of the darkness
[33:09] and over diseases and all but if we go
[33:11] to Luke chapter 19 beginning in verse
[33:14] one cuz they've got this mixed up but
[33:16] anyway um Luke 19 verse1 says and Jesus
[33:20] entered and passed through Jericho and
[33:22] behold there was a man named zachus
[33:24] which was the chief among the publicans
[33:26] and was rich and he sought to see Jesus
[33:28] who he was and could not for the Press
[33:31] because he was little of stature and he
[33:33] ran before and he climbed up in a
[33:34] sycamore tree to see him for he was to
[33:36] pass that way and when Jesus came to the
[33:39] place he looked up and saw him and said
[33:41] unto him zachus make haste and come down
[33:43] for today I must abide at thy house and
[33:46] he made haste and came down and received
[33:48] him joyfully and when he saw it they all
[33:50] murmured saying that he was gone to be a
[33:53] guest with a man that is a sinner and
[33:56] zakus stood and said unto the Lord whole
[33:58] Lord the half of my goods I give to the
[34:00] poor and if I have taken anything from
[34:02] any man by false accusation I restore
[34:04] him fourfold and Jesus said unto him
[34:06] this day is salvation come to this house
[34:09] for as much he is also a son of Abraham
[34:11] for the son of man is come to seek and
[34:13] Sav that which was lost am amen God
[34:16] bless you you may be seated this
[34:18] evening
[34:22] so they got that mixed up a little bit
[34:24] so but
[34:26] amen all the word all the words
[34:29] good just like the like the old black
[34:32] man said they want to know where he
[34:34] wanted to read from he said just read it
[34:35] he said it's all got to be
[34:37] preached so God bless you and uh y'all
[34:42] just just help me this evening a little
[34:44] bit I want to speak a little thought on
[34:46] prepare the way and
[34:49] uh that the scripture here in Isaiah
[34:53] what what he brings out and you can read
[34:55] the whole scripture and basically if you
[34:57] read the whole book of Isaiah you know
[35:00] Israel Israel's in sin and Isaiah is
[35:03] trying to restore it is calling for
[35:05] Israel to come back to God because God
[35:08] wants to restore
[35:11] them and U here he is speaking again
[35:15] and and you and you see when when Isaiah
[35:19] starts to speak in in in this chapter
[35:21] he's speaking uh he's he's identifying
[35:25] Israel as a harlot and he's talking
[35:27] about the things that they do and one of
[35:29] the things that you find out when he
[35:30] gets into the scripture here in verse 10
[35:33] and he says I just kind of break this
[35:37] down for you a little bit he said Thou
[35:39] Art wearied in the greatness of Thy Thy
[35:42] way he said yet sayest thou not there is
[35:46] no hope and he says but thou Hast found
[35:50] the life of thine hand therefore thou
[35:53] was not grieved and now what what he's
[35:56] saying is when you look back at what
[35:58] he's what he's trying to say is they
[36:01] were looking at the journey the the
[36:03] travel that they were in the
[36:04] relationship they had with God and he
[36:06] said that y'all see that it's uh great
[36:09] or the or the length of of the travel of
[36:12] the things that you've gone through and
[36:13] he said yet you said that uh we have no
[36:16] hope yeah yeah because they're in sin
[36:19] and they're looking at what they have
[36:21] yet they don't realize that they have no
[36:23] hope because they never come to the
[36:25] point and realize that they or how bad a
[36:28] shape they're in is what he's saying
[36:30] because he's pointing back and saiding
[36:31] but y'all don't realize just how bad
[36:33] y'all are and he said thou Hast found
[36:35] the life of thine hand therefore was
[36:38] thou not grieved or what he's what he's
[36:40] getting to at this point is he was
[36:43] talking about he said y'all have found a
[36:45] place of uh of rest or relaxation one of
[36:49] the one of the translations of this says
[36:51] that they were quickened and the and the
[36:53] way that you uh get you to understand
[36:56] what he's trying to drive at is here is
[36:58] he's talking about the the length and
[37:00] the and the travel and and the
[37:01] relationship with God yet as many times
[37:04] people do that they go out in and live
[37:06] in a world of sin and a life of sin and
[37:09] then all they want to do is stop doing
[37:10] that for a while they don't want to ever
[37:12] get away from it but they want to they
[37:14] want to get away from it and ease their
[37:16] conscience long enough because they just
[37:18] want to just cover it over but then
[37:21] they'll go right back to it and that's
[37:23] what he's saying is here this because he
[37:24] said you were you've wearied in this but
[37:26] he said you never come to the place to
[37:28] realize that you need to come to me
[37:30] because you have no hope and so they're
[37:32] they're driving at this point and he
[37:34] said yet he said yet you've not been
[37:35] grieved or you you've not come to the
[37:37] place that you need to come back to
[37:38] where I am because you've just come and
[37:40] you just set it aside for a little while
[37:42] and you relax and you know you just try
[37:44] to live a moral life and then you go
[37:46] right back to it and you've not come to
[37:48] the place that you need to come back and
[37:49] and just turn away from all that and
[37:51] leave that but they go right back to it
[37:54] and so he said see they've not seen how
[37:56] bad they are he said yet you've not been
[37:58] grieved you you've not come to the place
[38:00] of repentance you've not come to a place
[38:02] of of seeing just how morally rep rep
[38:07] reprehensible you are and so then he
[38:10] goes on and talks
[38:12] about and he said of whom hast thou been
[38:17] afraid or feared that thou Hast lied and
[38:20] Hast not remembered me nor laid it to
[38:23] thy heart right so whatever has happened
[38:27] to them that has caused them to
[38:29] fear they they they re reacted in fear
[38:33] but they never thought of God and when
[38:34] they were in the time of fear even
[38:36] though God was there and wanted to speak
[38:39] to them yet when they had fear and they
[38:41] were afraid yet they never thought of
[38:43] God right they went they just went on
[38:46] and so then he continues on he said and
[38:48] thou Hast lied and Hast not remembered
[38:51] me so when somebody come and and ask
[38:54] them are you a Christian or they come
[38:56] and ask somebody something that that was
[38:58] going to be hard to them they just
[38:59] thought well we'll just take the easy
[39:01] route out and we'll just lie about it
[39:04] yeah you know just like Abraham did with
[39:07] with his wife you know when when they
[39:08] asked about with Sarah his wife no
[39:10] that's my sister right instead of
[39:12] telling the truth it was just easier to
[39:14] lie about it and so it's the same way
[39:17] with Israel when they come to when
[39:18] they've had fear or when they when the
[39:20] Press came on them they just lied about
[39:22] it and he said and he said nor laid it
[39:25] into thy heart so what it was was they
[39:28] went through all this and it never
[39:29] affected them they lied and it never
[39:32] affected their heart it never had any
[39:34] effect on them and you know and because
[39:37] here as you get through this see God is
[39:40] grieved by this and that's the reason
[39:42] that he was speaking through Isaiah was
[39:44] he was speaking because it grieved him
[39:46] to see Israel in their condition but you
[39:49] know what they didn't they didn't care
[39:51] but he stood there and then when he when
[39:53] it continues on here he said of whom
[39:56] hast thou been afraid and fear and thou
[39:58] Hast lied and has not remembered me nor
[40:00] laid it in thy heart have I not held my
[40:02] peace even of old and thou Hast not
[40:04] feared me yeah so he didn't speak to
[40:07] them even though he was there and they
[40:10] knew it but you know what they got to
[40:12] the point where you know what they had
[40:13] no fear of God they never thought of God
[40:16] they never thought of what would take
[40:18] place they never thought the penalty and
[40:20] the price they would have to pay for
[40:22] their actions they never they never
[40:24] thought of that so because God said well
[40:26] because I never spoke to you you forgot
[40:29] what it was going to cost you right and
[40:32] so he continu on here he's trying to get
[40:34] them to understand what kind of
[40:36] condition they're in he said I would
[40:38] declare thy righteousness and thy works
[40:40] for they shalt not profit thee so he's
[40:43] he's telling them their condition and
[40:45] the things they do have no profit to you
[40:47] why because it's going to cost you more
[40:48] in the end and so he's going to continue
[40:51] how what it's going to cost them he said
[40:53] but when thou criest let thy companies
[40:56] deliver thee but the wind shall carry
[40:58] them all away right so what he was
[41:00] talking about was Israel being in
[41:02] idolatry he said but when you cry out he
[41:05] said cry out to your Idols cry out to
[41:08] your false gods and let them answer but
[41:10] he said when you call out he said the
[41:12] wind will carry them away he said they
[41:14] will all be blown away he said nothing
[41:16] will stand they'll all be destroyed
[41:18] because because there's nothing that's
[41:19] going to stand before them he said
[41:21] vanity shall take them he shall put but
[41:24] he that putteth his trust in me shall
[41:26] possess the land or the scripture says
[41:28] he that puts his trust in me shall
[41:30] possess the Earth possess his Earth and
[41:34] he said and then he goes on and says and
[41:36] he shall inherit my Holy
[41:38] Mountain right or the possession that
[41:41] God has for
[41:43] him and he said and shall say cast ye up
[41:48] cast you up prepare the way take up the
[41:50] stumbling block out of the way of the
[41:52] people out of my people so what what
[41:54] they're saying here is when when this
[41:56] person that comes to this place of
[41:58] receiving this inheritance and they take
[42:00] this the person that trusts in God and
[42:02] they take their possession then that
[42:04] person will cry out that they will tell
[42:07] them he said cast you up or cast you up
[42:09] and what that what that means is for you
[42:11] to prepare a road to prepare a path and
[42:15] what you do before you go out and pave a
[42:17] road you've got to go out and you've got
[42:18] to scrape the road and you've got to add
[42:21] uh dirt and such to it gravel to build
[42:24] it up because you can't just pave on
[42:26] anything
[42:27] and so what what he's saying cast you up
[42:29] or Build It Up Lift It Up he said
[42:31] prepare the way or or make the road or
[42:33] make the highway as one uh translation
[42:36] says make the highway make this highway
[42:40] and then he
[42:44] says take up The Stumbling Buck out of
[42:47] the way of my people or the things that
[42:48] are because these are the way as you're
[42:50] as you're laying this Foundation then
[42:51] you're going to remove the things that
[42:53] are standing between you and God because
[42:55] that's what the people of God are going
[42:56] to do so he's saying these people are
[42:58] going to cry out because somebody that
[43:00] trusts in God now everybody else just
[43:02] held on to their Idols they just
[43:04] continue to do the same thing but there
[43:06] was somebody who was raising up and they
[43:08] were going to stand there and they were
[43:09] going to call out and they were going to
[43:10] show people the way they were going to
[43:13] prepare the way for the people because
[43:15] you know the thing is it wasn't just
[43:17] that Isaiah came out there or any of the
[43:19] prophets ever came and just spoke just
[43:22] to be speaking but he spoke to a a group
[43:25] because somebody was there to hear the
[43:26] word because brother bham said that God
[43:28] just didn't send his word out for
[43:30] nothing but there was a group that was
[43:31] going to hear that word so there was a
[43:33] group that came because somebody was
[43:35] calling out to tell them to come back
[43:38] because there was a way made there was a
[43:40] way made for the people to come to this
[43:45] am he said for thus
[43:47] saith the high and lofty one that
[43:49] inherit inhabiteth eternity whose name
[43:52] is Holy I will dwell in the high and
[43:54] holy place with him also that of a
[43:57] contrite and humble Spirit to revive the
[43:59] spirit of him of the the spirit of the
[44:01] humble and to revive the heart of the
[44:03] contrite once so there was a place a
[44:07] high a high and holy place which was the
[44:11] word which was the place of Fellowship
[44:13] because when you when you go into the
[44:15] Old Testament and you look when they
[44:16] talk about Mount Zion or when they talk
[44:19] about Jerusalem when they talk about
[44:20] going up they were talking about not
[44:22] just a place because it wasn't geography
[44:25] that they're speaking when David speaks
[44:27] of Zion he or Isaiah even speaks of the
[44:30] the ones returning back to Zion they're
[44:32] not speaking of a geographical place
[44:34] they're not just talking of the city of
[44:36] Jerusalem because the most important
[44:38] place in all Jerusalem and all of that
[44:41] was the holy of holies because that was
[44:43] the place of of divine Fellowship so
[44:45] when they speak of Mount Zion they're
[44:47] not talking about coming to any place
[44:49] they're talking about Divine fellowship
[44:50] with God because you're coming back to
[44:52] that place and so this is what he's
[44:54] talking about when you come back you're
[44:56] coming back into Divine Fellowship
[44:58] because you're coming back to the word
[45:00] you're coming back to the fullness of
[45:01] the
[45:04] word but he said the only way that you
[45:06] can do that is to have a contrite and
[45:08] humble Spirit to revive those that have
[45:13] this to revive these and he said for I
[45:17] will not
[45:18] contend forever neither will always be
[45:21] rough for the spirit shall
[45:23] fail before me and the Souls which I
[45:26] have made right because he said there's
[45:30] a time that this is going to be over
[45:31] with he wasn't going he wasn't going to
[45:33] contend with them he wasn't going to
[45:34] fight with them he wasn't going to try
[45:36] to call them because there was a time
[45:38] that mercy and Grace was to be extended
[45:40] and after that it was over with but
[45:42] here's the time so he's making his his
[45:44] call made to Israel for them to
[45:50] come and that's because that is what
[45:54] what God has for us amen because now is
[45:57] the
[45:59] time because God is calling for his for
[46:02] his people now he's calling for the
[46:04] bride now because that's this is the
[46:06] call but you know he's laid it out there
[46:08] because many people have stood around
[46:10] the message around around the churches
[46:13] and and but they have not come into this
[46:16] place I mean you can you can be good you
[46:18] can be moral you can do a lot of things
[46:20] but if you're not born again it doesn't
[46:22] matter there there's no there's no place
[46:24] to be but you've got to come into this
[46:26] place place and he's standing there
[46:28] calling out to every individual the the
[46:31] Call's been made but it's your choice
[46:34] amen so you have to you have to
[46:38] call and that's the reason I want to
[46:41] speak on this because you know brother
[46:44] brandham makes a makes a an interesting
[46:47] thing and is from the message God ha uh
[46:50] a provided way in
[46:52] 1956 and he and he's talking he says
[46:55] don't you like to entertain people he
[46:58] said don't you like to go out and take
[46:59] people to your home and entertain them
[47:00] you clean up everything you fix
[47:02] everything you know put a little flow
[47:04] here you this is just the way they would
[47:07] like it fix a little thing here now see
[47:10] they like this so you fix it just making
[47:13] arrangements I know that they like this
[47:15] kind of meat so you prepare the meat
[47:17] real spicy and nice because if you can't
[47:19] do it you get somebody else to do it but
[47:22] who can do it better you're making
[47:23] arrangements preparations for something
[47:26] because you want your
[47:27] to be highly
[47:28] entertained he said God HD in sunred
[47:31] times he wanted his children to have the
[47:33] best so he made the preparations he
[47:35] foreshadowed it through the prophets he
[47:37] revealed it in Christ and the table set
[47:39] today and every man woman that's invited
[47:42] has a welcome to come to this table for
[47:44] he was wounded for our transgressions
[47:46] with his stripes we were healed it's all
[47:48] foreseen it's provided and prepared the
[47:51] meal's ready they the call is given he
[47:53] foresaw it he made a prep he made
[47:55] preparations it's God's provided way for
[47:58] you when your souls are hungry right so
[48:02] here he is he's speaking of of making a
[48:04] preparation and you
[48:06] know one of the the the last two sermons
[48:09] that that I that I preached on or a
[48:12] couple of them that that I had preached
[48:13] on you know um one of them was uh
[48:16] speaking on Isaiah 61 and you know I
[48:20] kind of like the book of Isaiah just
[48:21] kind of speaks to me sometimes but you
[48:23] know Isaiah 63 because when he speaks of
[48:26] when Jesus Takes the book in Isaiah and
[48:28] he's reading it and he's speaking of the
[48:30] first of his first coming you know
[48:32] Isaiah is writing but then in the verse
[48:34] three he says to appoint unto them that
[48:36] mourn in Zion Beauty for Ashes the oil
[48:39] of joy for mourning the Garment of
[48:41] Praise for the spirit of heaviness and
[48:43] when you go back and you look at at the
[48:45] verse there where it says a point you
[48:47] know many people look at that word a
[48:49] point and I don't know if you remember
[48:51] but many people look at it as as
[48:52] something that's just set aside or a
[48:55] decision that's made but when you go
[48:57] back in the scripture and you look at
[48:59] that when he speaks of what he appointed
[49:02] that wasn't something he just set aside
[49:04] it wasn't something he said but that's
[49:06] actually something that was actually
[49:07] laid on them because one of the trans uh
[49:10] definitions of that word means to
[49:11] transform
[49:13] into so so when he laid that on them
[49:16] when he put that on there so when you're
[49:17] speaking of of of what he's done he's
[49:19] made this preparation for you it wasn't
[49:22] that he just made a decision for you
[49:23] Brother Richard but when he came inside
[49:25] of you he prepared prepared you for this
[49:28] because you have been given because see
[49:30] everywhere I go I want everybody to know
[49:32] he said everything that you have need of
[49:33] in this Earthly Journey was given to you
[49:36] but the thing is is it's just like a
[49:38] soldier brother R talks about a soldier
[49:40] when he goes into battle when he hears
[49:42] that sound he's been trained he's been
[49:44] he because you know there was a there's
[49:46] a little slogan somebody said he said
[49:47] don't practice something to get it right
[49:49] he said practice it till you can't get
[49:51] it
[49:53] wrong so when you're practicing see a
[49:55] soldier when they give ready it doesn't
[49:57] matter what kind of pressure they're
[49:58] under or what happens you know what they
[50:00] know what to do but you know what
[50:02] they're equipped to do the job so you're
[50:04] given them and so God has given us
[50:06] everything so you know what the
[50:08] pressures that you're under the things
[50:09] that happen to you you know what it
[50:11] doesn't take God by surprise but the
[50:13] thing is is you've got to know that
[50:14] you're equipped to do that he said
[50:16] that's the reason he said for you to
[50:18] take on the whole armor of God see
[50:20] you've been that you may quench the
[50:22] fiery darts of the enemy that you can
[50:23] overcome the devil why because you've
[50:25] been equipped not that because God knows
[50:28] what you can do but you've got to know
[50:30] what you can do he knew what job could
[50:33] do but job had to know where he stood
[50:35] with God when he knew what where he
[50:37] stood with God see then he knew God was
[50:40] real he knew God had spoke to him he had
[50:42] a revelation but that's the only way
[50:44] that you and I will ever have a
[50:45] revelation we've got to have an
[50:46] experience with
[50:48] something see you just can't have you
[50:50] just can't have there's a lot of people
[50:52] in the world they can they can do a lot
[50:53] of talking they know a lot of talking
[50:55] they can read a lot of things things but
[50:56] the thing is is it real is it life to
[50:59] them is it something that's changed you
[51:02] that's
[51:03] right because I don't want to I don't
[51:05] want to be the same old Aaron Roberts
[51:07] that I was I don't want to have anything
[51:08] to do with that old man I you know
[51:10] because he's been gone he's been buried
[51:13] in the in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[51:15] and I don't ever want to see him again
[51:18] right I don't ever want to dig him up I
[51:21] don't want anybody else digging him up
[51:28] but see God has appointed these things
[51:30] to us he's provided these things to us
[51:33] so if we understand what's been provided
[51:35] for us because see we you know God can
[51:38] lay these things out before you but the
[51:40] thing is is you've got to use
[51:42] them but the thing is is there God has
[51:45] God had many times people talk about you
[51:48] know brother Bram talks about God uh
[51:50] money in the
[51:51] bank you know when it when he talks
[51:53] about the the lady that had the had the
[51:55] checks from India her son was in India
[51:58] you know she had them all in her Bible
[51:59] she didn't realize what she had she
[52:01] carried around all the everything that
[52:02] she had needed in her Bible but she
[52:04] didn't realize she had what she was
[52:05] needing she was standing there starving
[52:07] to death trying to get somebody to help
[52:09] her and she had everything in her Bible
[52:11] and brother BR say you know she thought
[52:12] that it was just pretty pictures to her
[52:14] but he said come to come to find out it
[52:16] was real value to her and then he turns
[52:19] around and says and brother he said when
[52:21] they try to tell you of a painted fire
[52:23] of Pentecost he said don't you believe
[52:25] it see many people have talk about what
[52:28] happened in the good old days but you
[52:30] know what what happened in the good old
[52:32] days still happens today the problem is
[52:34] as people have got their eyes filmed
[52:36] over and can't see that God's still here
[52:39] because they want to talk about what
[52:40] happened years ago well praise to God
[52:42] what happened years ago but you know
[52:44] that same one is still here today to do
[52:46] the same thing and brother ROM says you
[52:48] know he's here tonight to heal the sick
[52:50] to save the lost to fill with those
[52:52] filled with the Holy Ghost those who
[52:53] want to be filled he said do you agree
[52:55] with that you you know the congregation
[52:58] says amen and I read that everywhere I
[53:00] go why because I want people to know I
[53:02] still believe he's say he's the same
[53:04] yesterday today and forever because what
[53:05] he started way back there he still does
[53:07] it tonight but the thing is is you and I
[53:09] have to come on the same ground the same
[53:12] Faith the same understanding that they
[53:14] had to receive it because you know what
[53:16] he's still here tonight to do it but
[53:18] you've got to believe that he's going to
[53:19] do it
[53:21] right many people can say well God can
[53:24] well I believe God will
[53:29] but what a lot of people talk about
[53:30] money in the bank you know they talk
[53:32] about money in the bank well see that's
[53:33] some kind of abstract concept or
[53:36] something but you know the thing is is
[53:37] it's different when somebody takes when
[53:40] it's like when it's something that
[53:41] somebody hands you
[53:44] right see it's not it's not just because
[53:46] we use that as a as a as a form of
[53:49] understanding but see we don't realize
[53:51] that it's actually there right
[53:54] exactly because lots of times we say
[53:56] well you know we can have a money you
[53:58] know Bank full of money next thing you
[53:59] know it's all gone cuz all all it is is
[54:02] a bunch of ones and zeros
[54:05] yeah right brother Anderson tell you all
[54:08] about that yeah people going have money
[54:11] next thing you know they got
[54:13] nothing but see the thing is the
[54:15] scripture tells us you know what thieves
[54:17] can't get to
[54:18] this moth moths can't destroy this
[54:21] there's nothing that can happen to this
[54:23] because it's been given to you then
[54:25] there's nothing that can be Tak away
[54:26] from you but the problem is is you won't
[54:29] use
[54:30] it it's been given to
[54:33] us he said it's the father's good
[54:35] pleasure to give you the kingdom but the
[54:37] problem is is you've got to believe it
[54:39] and you got to use it because he said as
[54:42] as many times that we know that you got
[54:44] people that can write a check but they
[54:45] got no money in the bank and you got
[54:46] people that can write you know that got
[54:48] money in the bank but they can't write a
[54:50] check and so people got to understand
[54:52] that you've got to know what you've got
[54:54] and you got to know how to use it right
[54:55] exactly right that's
[54:58] sir so when when God speaks this is what
[55:02] what we have been given this is this is
[55:04] what has been given so he's prepared the
[55:06] way for
[55:07] you but the thing is is because you've
[55:10] got to prepare the way to use it
[55:13] right because that's what God wants us
[55:16] to do just realize you've got to prepare
[55:18] the way because we the way has been
[55:22] prepared but you've got to get prepared
[55:24] because you know he when when Isaiah or
[55:28] when God spoke to Moses and was telling
[55:30] him about bringing the children of
[55:32] Israel
[55:33] out you know there was there had a way
[55:36] had been provided long before
[55:40] that and you know I was I was listening
[55:42] to brother brand and he was preaching on
[55:44] the message uh teaching on Moses when he
[55:47] was talking to the children and you know
[55:49] many times we all we'll take that and
[55:51] we'll go right back to you know the
[55:52] foundation of the world we'll say you
[55:53] know God had all this provided way
[55:55] before the Foundation War by the way all
[55:57] this was laid out and God knew what was
[55:58] going to take
[56:00] place but you know there was people that
[56:02] didn't know what was going to take place
[56:03] oh yeah that's right exactly when you go
[56:05] back and you read that and what struck
[56:07] me was brother Brown was talking about
[56:10] amram and amram you know he went out
[56:13] there and he saw the condition that his
[56:17] people were in yeah and he saw what was
[56:20] taking place and you know you go back
[56:21] and you read and he said you know what
[56:23] he saw those young men were going
[56:24] through all the time how they were being
[56:27] mistreated and all the things that took
[56:29] place and you know he would come home
[56:31] and and he didn't even want to eat all
[56:33] he wanted to do was pray to God yeah and
[56:35] he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat all he
[56:37] want to do was pray to God why because
[56:39] he wanted God to come and deliver his
[56:41] people he said are you are we not are we
[56:43] not your
[56:44] people we want deliverance we want we
[56:47] want to see something take place and you
[56:50] know he just kept on praying to God
[56:51] every night you know and every time he'd
[56:53] go out and he'd pray all night and then
[56:55] he'd get up and he' go to work the next
[56:56] day and it was worse than it was the day
[56:58] before and you know he just go right
[57:00] back and he would go right back in and
[57:01] he was praying all the time looking for
[57:03] a deliverer
[57:06] amen I think it was brother brother klie
[57:09] I may be wrong but I think it was
[57:10] brother collie was talking about
[57:12] somebody and you know they were talking
[57:14] about praying all night because they
[57:15] wanted to see a Revival and they just
[57:17] kept praying and praying the most of the
[57:19] night and you know the Lord told them
[57:21] said well if you just pray a little bit
[57:22] longer you can have a Revival
[57:26] and people saying well Lord I'm praying
[57:28] most of the night
[57:29] already but you know what they didn't do
[57:32] that when God said pray some pray longer
[57:34] pray longer you know what that's exactly
[57:35] what they done they kept praying longer
[57:37] and praying longer and praying longer
[57:39] and you know what a Revival took place
[57:41] but you know what God gave them the
[57:42] answer but he wanted to see just how far
[57:45] they would go with that and you know
[57:47] here was amram and he just kept going on
[57:49] on and on and on because you he saw the
[57:52] condition that they were in but you know
[57:54] what he kept crying out for a delivery
[57:56] and you know it wasn't just Moses and
[57:58] them but you know it was his father and
[58:00] those that were there they kept praying
[58:02] and all of a sudden God come to amram
[58:04] and told him he said the deliverer will
[58:06] come right and you know what then the
[58:09] next day he didn't cry out to God
[58:11] anymore why because when he received
[58:12] that Revelation then he went out there
[58:15] praise God let's make some more bricks
[58:17] well guess what the the Egyptians want
[58:19] more bricks we're going to make more
[58:20] bricks but you know what our day our
[58:22] days of making bricks is over there's a
[58:25] day it's appointed unto us that we're
[58:27] going to quit this brick making and
[58:28] we're going to go into a land flowing
[58:30] with milk and honey we're going into a
[58:31] land that's promised to us we're coming
[58:33] out of this place because you know he
[58:36] went back but it was the same situation
[58:38] that he was in but he kept going back
[58:40] and he was so thrilled why because he
[58:42] knew God had spoke to him and one a day
[58:45] when it came time according to life
[58:48] Joseph had bore a son
[58:51] right and you know what was so amazing
[58:53] you know he didn't get upset because
[58:56] when this was going on the Egyptians
[58:58] were killing babies killing baby boys
[59:00] and that's what he had but you know what
[59:03] he knew God had spoke to him didn't
[59:04] matter to
[59:07] him God had his hand on this boy he come
[59:11] to do a
[59:12] job that's right it didn't matter what
[59:14] was going to take place God was there
[59:16] God was going to take place God was
[59:17] going to take care of him and when he
[59:19] got to be three months old you know he
[59:21] had to go down there and he had to make
[59:23] a decision not not not a wonderful
[59:25] decision not something anybody wanted to
[59:26] do but it was something that had to be
[59:28] done he went and told Joseph and and and
[59:31] Miriam and them and said listen we've
[59:33] got to get rid of him we've got to take
[59:34] him and do something with him because
[59:36] they're going to find him and they're
[59:37] going to kill him and God spoke to him
[59:40] and told him said there's a way out
[59:42] there's a way but you've got to make
[59:44] it God gave him the way but you know
[59:47] what amram was down there making and
[59:50] taking sticks and waving a
[59:54] basket and Aaron went got Pitch and you
[59:56] know they fixed the ark for Moses to
[59:58] float in God gave him away but you know
[1:00:01] what amram had to take that and make
[1:00:03] that Ark right and they had to put him
[1:00:05] in the in the O in the river and send
[1:00:08] him
[1:00:10] away but see the thing is is they
[1:00:12] thought they they thought they were
[1:00:13] trying to you know they thought they
[1:00:15] were losing him and didn't realize that
[1:00:18] he was in he was in the plan of God he
[1:00:20] was in God's hands because as soon as
[1:00:23] soon as he went and and Pharaoh's
[1:00:25] daughter found the next thing you know
[1:00:27] Miriam was there and said oh do you need
[1:00:29] a nurse well I know a wonderful lady
[1:00:31] that can take care of your son the one
[1:00:34] that boring but you don't know that
[1:00:37] right so what she got paid to take care
[1:00:40] of her own child right amen and so here
[1:00:44] he was when when death was all around
[1:00:46] God had a place to put his Prophet that
[1:00:49] he was stationed and that he was
[1:00:51] appointed to this place why because he
[1:00:54] was given everything they had need of he
[1:00:56] was given the best education the best
[1:00:58] everything when his when everybody that
[1:01:00] was related to him was under that death
[1:01:02] curse out there dying and sweating and
[1:01:04] toiling there was a Moses sitting there
[1:01:07] in the lap of
[1:01:10] luxury and God had his hand on him and
[1:01:12] brought him through to the place that
[1:01:14] when he came old
[1:01:16] enough see that whole time when he was
[1:01:19] under that see his mom was teaching him
[1:01:21] the whole time that you know what you're
[1:01:22] the
[1:01:23] deliverer you're not that woman woman
[1:01:26] son but you've come from from the mind
[1:01:29] of God to deliver these people that's
[1:01:33] right and see and then but see he got
[1:01:35] exalted in himself and he tried to do it
[1:01:38] by himself he didn't wait on God to do
[1:01:40] it he tried to do it in his and that's
[1:01:43] where he failed yeah he was the
[1:01:45] deliverer but it wasn't the time and he
[1:01:47] wasn't in the right condition to do the
[1:01:49] job but when he came to the place and
[1:01:51] then he was on the backs side of the
[1:01:52] desert and he forgot everything that he
[1:01:54] had and he forgot everything thing that
[1:01:56] he learned and he got rid of everything
[1:01:58] else and he thought he couldn't do
[1:01:59] nothing and he was worthless then God
[1:02:01] said you're at the right time you're in
[1:02:03] the right place I can use
[1:02:05] you because he wanted to stand there
[1:02:07] because see God had told him through his
[1:02:09] mother who he was but you know he got to
[1:02:11] the place where he didn't realize and
[1:02:13] didn't believe that but you know what
[1:02:15] God had proven had made him got him
[1:02:18] ready to the job that had to be done and
[1:02:21] when he come to that place then he went
[1:02:22] out there and and God told you know he
[1:02:25] told God I can't speak I can't do these
[1:02:27] things I can't go before
[1:02:30] Pharaoh yeah you're perfect I got you
[1:02:32] right where I want you
[1:02:36] molded and he said guess what you can't
[1:02:40] speak well your brother can speak and
[1:02:43] speak for
[1:02:46] you that's what Richard always said
[1:02:48] about
[1:02:50] me he said I'm like Moses I can't talk
[1:02:53] but I got a brother named Aaron and he
[1:02:55] can
[1:02:56] just ask him he'll talk right and he can
[1:02:59] talk talk talk talk
[1:03:04] talk he'll talk about it whether he
[1:03:05] knows it or not just he'll
[1:03:09] talk but see God had it all planned out
[1:03:12] for Moses and when he went forth then he
[1:03:15] could step right in and he could go but
[1:03:18] see he was
[1:03:20] walking in the prayers and the faith
[1:03:23] that his father had yeah right because
[1:03:26] his father had went through all that and
[1:03:28] I don't know probably died in
[1:03:33] bondage but you know what there was
[1:03:36] Moses and God come down and met him and
[1:03:38] said I've heard the Cry of my people
[1:03:41] amen and he said I come down right but
[1:03:44] you know what you're going to be
[1:03:45] anointed to do
[1:03:47] this you're coming to deliver these
[1:03:49] people and you know what he done
[1:03:53] that every obstacle mes had God had an
[1:03:57] had a way for him had an answer for him
[1:03:59] but you know he just had to keep
[1:04:02] trusting even though the even though
[1:04:04] these
[1:04:05] people this group of people that were
[1:04:07] there that were longing to leave this
[1:04:12] place yet you know they they're Desiring
[1:04:15] to leave and when the door opens up
[1:04:17] they're still standing
[1:04:19] there he's trying to drag them out the
[1:04:21] door that's
[1:04:22] right and then every time because that
[1:04:26] they never saw never come to
[1:04:29] understanding that God had delivered
[1:04:30] them and he was going to continue to do
[1:04:33] that and they were
[1:04:36] unthankful everything had God done and
[1:04:39] all they could do was murmur and
[1:04:40] complain right
[1:04:42] right and when they come out of that
[1:04:44] then they went back and said oh we wish
[1:04:45] we were back there it was so wonderful
[1:04:48] the leaks and the garlics you know we
[1:04:50] had we had such a wonderful life of ease
[1:04:52] in Egypt yeah oh yeah
[1:04:57] we don't we don't remember all the
[1:04:58] people that died under the under the
[1:05:00] rule of the taskmasters we don't
[1:05:01] remember all the conditions that we
[1:05:02] lived in we don't remember how they took
[1:05:04] everything from us we just remember it's
[1:05:06] so wonderful yeah
[1:05:09] yeah see there's people that come out
[1:05:11] from come out from the world and see if
[1:05:13] you don't if you if you don't get right
[1:05:15] with God if you don't get filled with
[1:05:18] something the devil can paint you this
[1:05:21] nice pretty
[1:05:22] picture and people have come right out
[1:05:24] and you know because you can live a good
[1:05:27] life you can carry your message books
[1:05:29] and you can carry a Bible and you can
[1:05:31] just try to live
[1:05:32] it but as long as you're trying to live
[1:05:35] it it won't get you anywhere right it's
[1:05:37] going to profit you absolutely nothing
[1:05:39] just like just like Israel did when God
[1:05:42] was trying to tell them come on you need
[1:05:44] to come back to me and live the right
[1:05:46] kind of life and and get right with me
[1:05:49] right because no we're just going to
[1:05:51] take it easy we feel better we'll just
[1:05:53] go right back to it yeah and then that's
[1:05:56] what they do people
[1:05:58] just paint them a pretty picture and
[1:06:00] they're right back out in it oh
[1:06:02] yeah and it's worse the second time
[1:06:05] around that's right
[1:06:06] yeah amen but God made a way for them
[1:06:10] God brought them to the place God
[1:06:12] brought them through and he brought
[1:06:14] Moses to the place and he carried them
[1:06:17] through the into up to the
[1:06:20] land Moses done his part but you know
[1:06:24] there was there was one that came
[1:06:25] through that carried them all the
[1:06:27] way and you there was a there was a
[1:06:29] group of people that you know they may
[1:06:31] not have seen all the things that took
[1:06:33] place in Egypt they might have not seen
[1:06:35] all of but you know they had a they they
[1:06:38] heard about it yeah because you know the
[1:06:41] little ones there in the scripture in in
[1:06:43] numbers he says and and your little ones
[1:06:46] who you think will be a prey he said
[1:06:48] they'll go in and take that land they'll
[1:06:50] possess the land he said but your
[1:06:52] carcass is rot in the
[1:06:54] wilderness why because he kept trying to
[1:06:56] show them that there was a way made that
[1:06:59] but they had to prepare themselves to go
[1:07:01] in just like when they when they had the
[1:07:04] um the feast I mean the uh unleavened
[1:07:07] bread with the lamb you know they had to
[1:07:08] get ready to go out and then when they
[1:07:11] got ready to go in the land Joshua was
[1:07:13] there and told him said you prepare
[1:07:15] yourself because you're going
[1:07:17] in so he told him said you know God has
[1:07:19] given you this
[1:07:22] land because Abraham walked on this land
[1:07:27] yeah see the thing is is see God
[1:07:31] Abraham's life prepared this place for
[1:07:33] him yeah God prepared it because he gave
[1:07:36] it to them but you know what Mo Abraham
[1:07:39] had the promise because Abraham walked
[1:07:41] in the
[1:07:42] land Abraham put his feet there because
[1:07:45] everywhere he stepped was his possession
[1:07:47] but when they got ready to go in see the
[1:07:49] way had been
[1:07:50] prepared because Abraham's Faith had
[1:07:53] laid that hold for his children's and
[1:07:55] his children children and all those
[1:07:57] generations to go into that land but you
[1:07:59] know what when it came time for them to
[1:08:01] stand out there and Joshua gave them the
[1:08:03] word and told them said y'all prepare
[1:08:05] because in three days we're going over
[1:08:07] you know what they had to get themselves
[1:08:09] ready because everything else had been
[1:08:11] done but it was time for them to get
[1:08:13] ready to go in the land because they
[1:08:15] couldn't you know because Abraham had
[1:08:16] done his part and Joshua had done his
[1:08:18] part but the problem is see they had to
[1:08:20] get themselves ready that's that was
[1:08:22] where the issue was and see when they
[1:08:24] got ready then they had to go in but you
[1:08:26] know what it wasn't just a cakewalk when
[1:08:28] they went
[1:08:30] in see they had they had to get past a
[1:08:32] lot of messages of doubt and fear and
[1:08:35] unbelief and a lot of mixed up uh
[1:08:38] doctrines and things like that when they
[1:08:40] went into that land because there was
[1:08:41] only two of the of the 10 or of the 12
[1:08:44] that actually had a had a real
[1:08:46] understanding of what was going to take
[1:08:48] place but see when they went in you know
[1:08:50] they had to
[1:08:52] fight they had to fight when they went
[1:08:54] in yeah it was there's land but you know
[1:08:56] what it just didn't lay there they had
[1:08:58] to go in and take
[1:09:00] it and say it's the same way you got to
[1:09:02] go up
[1:09:03] there you got to hit the road this is
[1:09:08] mine what they do they had to go out
[1:09:10] there and pull a sword and say listen
[1:09:11] you can leave or we can fight but y'all
[1:09:13] this is mine y'all going to have to go
[1:09:15] one way or the
[1:09:17] other and they had to make they had to
[1:09:19] make that determination that they were
[1:09:21] going to take it no matter what and a
[1:09:23] lot of them they F they F they took part
[1:09:25] of it but there was a lot of them that
[1:09:27] didn't take the land that didn't clear
[1:09:29] out all the unbelief that God told them
[1:09:31] to he said to utterly destroy it he said
[1:09:33] destroy all these people wipe them off
[1:09:35] push them off get rid of
[1:09:37] them but they think well we got 75% of
[1:09:40] it we're good 85% of it we're good no
[1:09:43] God said utterly destroy them get rid of
[1:09:46] them that's right and that's why that's
[1:09:48] why you know because what happened is
[1:09:50] later on they had the same issue they
[1:09:52] hadn't got rid of them and you know what
[1:09:53] they was born in their side forever
[1:09:55] right as long as they were there they
[1:09:57] had a thorn in the flesh because they
[1:09:59] never got rid of them because they never
[1:10:00] followed the word they never done what
[1:10:02] God told them to
[1:10:03] do so when God told him get rid of them
[1:10:05] get rid of
[1:10:13] them and so we know that see God has
[1:10:16] made a way he's made the way but they
[1:10:18] had to go in and take the land and do
[1:10:20] the things that God wanted them to do
[1:10:22] and all through the scriptures the same
[1:10:24] way right see God has laid the
[1:10:26] foundation and you I I think
[1:10:33] that I thank God that I had a I had a
[1:10:36] grandmother that believed this message I
[1:10:38] thank God that I had a grandmother that
[1:10:40] that had that really had a a
[1:10:42] relationship with Jesus Christ I believe
[1:10:44] I believe she had a a born again
[1:10:46] experience with this with with the god
[1:10:49] of Heaven I I believe she believed this
[1:10:51] message and I believe because I always
[1:10:52] knew one thing that no matter what what
[1:10:54] I where was at or what was going on in
[1:10:56] my life I had a grandmother that was
[1:10:58] praying for me see I I believe I believe
[1:11:00] today I'm the I'm and I you know you can
[1:11:03] look at me and and say whatever you know
[1:11:05] because I'm not what I what I used to be
[1:11:07] and I'm not what I want to be but thank
[1:11:09] God I'm not what I used to be but see
[1:11:11] the thing is I believe I'm standing here
[1:11:13] today as living manifestation of the
[1:11:15] faith of my grandmother because I I
[1:11:17] believe that's what takes place because
[1:11:19] somebody had had to pray for for me and
[1:11:21] each one of us we can go back and we can
[1:11:23] find somebody because you know somebody
[1:11:24] was praying somebody held the token over
[1:11:26] us somebody was doing something for us
[1:11:29] that we can come to this place you know
[1:11:32] I I think about the my you know my life
[1:11:36] and and my family and you know you go
[1:11:39] back and you look at you know um I had a
[1:11:43] grandfather you know he built some of
[1:11:45] the first you know Pentecostal churches
[1:11:47] in in the state of West Virginia and you
[1:11:51] know way back many many years ago when
[1:11:53] Pentecost was really Pentecost you know
[1:11:55] and you know when the um when ausa
[1:11:59] Street and all those you know different
[1:12:01] things were taking place and you know
[1:12:02] there's a there's a lot of family
[1:12:04] members you know they they look back and
[1:12:06] they say well we know what God really
[1:12:08] moved in the in our great grandfather
[1:12:10] and our great in in these people and all
[1:12:11] these type ones but you know what they
[1:12:13] still hold on to that as as their token
[1:12:17] as as their Banner that you know well it
[1:12:19] was good enough for Grandpa and it was
[1:12:21] good enough for Great Grandpa and all of
[1:12:22] them you know because they want but you
[1:12:24] know what they walked in the light for
[1:12:26] their day but the thing is is you know
[1:12:28] what God has moved on from there there's
[1:12:30] a greater light but shining there's
[1:12:32] there's something more than what they
[1:12:33] had and you know what I believe today
[1:12:35] because of their faith of what where
[1:12:37] they stood in the things because you
[1:12:39] know they were the ones that done
[1:12:40] without they were the ones that were
[1:12:42] ridiculed they were the ones that that
[1:12:43] were Outcast but you know what they
[1:12:45] stood with the word of God and they had
[1:12:47] faith and you know what I believe today
[1:12:48] that we're standing I'm standing where I
[1:12:50] am today because of what they've done
[1:12:53] why because they've laid the path for
[1:12:58] exactly and you know many other people
[1:13:00] can say the same thing they know you
[1:13:01] know because but a lot of people they
[1:13:03] just want to walk around and say well
[1:13:04] you
[1:13:05] know they want to hold that as a badge
[1:13:07] of
[1:13:09] honor but you know the thing is is
[1:13:11] Pentecost ain't where God is
[1:13:15] today because you know what God has come
[1:13:18] to Greater light and when when God has
[1:13:20] made known the word to you come on now
[1:13:23] when God opens the word to you and say
[1:13:25] well you know what I don't see that but
[1:13:27] I don't believe that but you know what
[1:13:29] it was good enough for Grandpa it's good
[1:13:31] enough for me
[1:13:33] yeah you can wear that as a badge if you
[1:13:36] want to but you know and I feel sorry
[1:13:39] for my family members because the way
[1:13:41] because they're under that because
[1:13:43] they're under that bondage why because
[1:13:46] because they've just held on to what
[1:13:48] what somebody else had but you know what
[1:13:51] I can't have somebody else's experience
[1:13:54] I can't I can't can't live what somebody
[1:13:56] else lived but you know what I believe
[1:13:58] what they laid was the foundation for
[1:13:59] what we came to because the life the
[1:14:02] word that came in our day was because of
[1:14:04] what they done what God moved back then
[1:14:06] but it God has moved today and he's made
[1:14:09] it known to us today and this is where
[1:14:11] God is today is for us to come to this
[1:14:14] place because God wants us to come here
[1:14:16] in the fullness of the word because I
[1:14:18] believe if my family members could come
[1:14:20] back today and were standing here today
[1:14:22] they'd be rejoicing for what they could
[1:14:24] hear today because over what they heard
[1:14:26] back there why because it's a greater
[1:14:28] light it's a greater Ministry than what
[1:14:30] they had back then that's
[1:14:36] right and see we can we can look and and
[1:14:39] and think about that all the way down
[1:14:41] through history you think about Peter
[1:14:43] and Paul and all of them all the things
[1:14:45] that they had if they could be here with
[1:14:47] us one time one service and see what and
[1:14:49] hear what we hear and heard what we've
[1:14:52] heard and to see where we stand today
[1:14:54] but you know what they have prepared the
[1:14:57] way for us they have laid this down but
[1:14:59] you know what with they without us
[1:15:00] cannot be made perfect because you know
[1:15:02] what we've got to come to the place that
[1:15:04] we've got to connect back to them in the
[1:15:06] fullness of the word because that's the
[1:15:08] only way they had the fullness of the
[1:15:10] word for their day but we've got to come
[1:15:11] back to the fullness of the word for our
[1:15:13] day we've got to come to the place that
[1:15:15] we Unite with
[1:15:18] them see we got to come and get them out
[1:15:20] of the ground why because when they have
[1:15:22] the fullness and we have the fullness
[1:15:23] then guess what when it connect then
[1:15:25] they come out of the ground because
[1:15:26] we're going to have the voice of the
[1:15:28] Resurrection that's going to speak to
[1:15:29] them that they're going to come up out
[1:15:31] of the
[1:15:33] ground see that's what that's what we
[1:15:36] have today that's the reason I'm so
[1:15:37] happy because I can see where I'm
[1:15:39] standing today why because God has made
[1:15:42] these things known to us because God has
[1:15:44] opened these things up to
[1:15:49] us but you know there's a and I just
[1:15:52] want to share a few other things with
[1:15:53] you but you know a lot of people when
[1:15:54] they talk about things that they they've
[1:15:56] tried to put up scarecrows and they triy
[1:15:58] to put up things to to scare people away
[1:16:01] and you
[1:16:03] know uh let's see if I can find this
[1:16:06] Brother Anderson if you can
[1:16:08] find Luke 6
[1:16:19] there well this is the first this first
[1:16:21] verse but we'll go to 46 here in a
[1:16:23] minute
[1:16:27] he said a good man out of the Jesus
[1:16:29] speaking he said a good man out of the
[1:16:31] good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:16:33] forth that which is good and the evil
[1:16:34] man out of the evil Treasure of his
[1:16:36] heart bringeth forth that which is evil
[1:16:38] for of the abundance of the heart his
[1:16:40] mouth speaketh so when he continues on
[1:16:43] in verse 46 and he says and why call ye
[1:16:46] me Lord Lord and do not the things which
[1:16:49] I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth
[1:16:52] my sath sayings and doeth them I will
[1:16:55] show you to whom he is
[1:16:57] like he said he is like a man which
[1:17:00] built a house and dig
[1:17:02] deep and laid a foundation on a rock and
[1:17:05] when the flood
[1:17:07] arose the stream beat vly against the
[1:17:09] house it could not shake it for it was
[1:17:11] founded upon a
[1:17:12] rock but he that heareth and doeth not
[1:17:15] is like a man that with that without a
[1:17:17] foundation built a house upon the Earth
[1:17:20] which when against which the scam the
[1:17:23] stream did beat vehemently and
[1:17:25] immediately it fell and the ruin of that
[1:17:27] house was great and you know the thing
[1:17:31] that always come back to me was in the
[1:17:33] message time tested Mor Memorials of God
[1:17:35] brother Ram talks about the young
[1:17:36] architect that came from England when
[1:17:38] they wanted to build the Great the
[1:17:39] bridge in Sydney and you know everybody
[1:17:41] else went down there and they looked at
[1:17:43] it and all they could see was the
[1:17:44] shifting sand and you everybody said you
[1:17:46] can't build a bridge here there's
[1:17:48] nothing to build upon but brother R said
[1:17:50] that man got a vision of what could take
[1:17:52] place and you know he kept digging and
[1:17:54] digging and digging until he found the
[1:17:56] rock because he had to dig to find it
[1:17:59] and you know many people they say well
[1:18:00] you know you know you got to stay away
[1:18:02] from those deep things but you know
[1:18:03] that's what the but the the the Bible
[1:18:05] says in in in the in Corinthians there
[1:18:08] it tells us that God by his Spirit
[1:18:11] revealeth the things to man he said eyes
[1:18:13] Not Seen Nor Ear heard nor have it
[1:18:16] entered into the heart of man what God
[1:18:17] has prepared for them but he said the
[1:18:20] spirit of God have made know these
[1:18:22] things known hath revealed them right
[1:18:26] and he said the things of God he said
[1:18:28] yay the Deep things of God so the things
[1:18:30] that we you know that that are so
[1:18:32] fabulous to us that maybe our finite
[1:18:34] Minds can't understand yet the spirit of
[1:18:36] God is here to reveal those things to
[1:18:39] you exactly so when that man came along
[1:18:42] there when he said the man that's heard
[1:18:43] this word see you've got to dig deep
[1:18:46] because he said the wise man he dug deep
[1:18:48] until he found the foundation many
[1:18:50] people say well you got to stay away
[1:18:52] from those deep things no that's where
[1:18:53] the foundation is that's what you build
[1:18:55] upon you got to dig and dig and dig
[1:18:58] until you find the foundation but many
[1:19:01] people have not come to the place where
[1:19:02] they're going to dig and dig and seek
[1:19:04] until they find the foundation to build
[1:19:08] upon he said when you come to that place
[1:19:11] then he said you can build as a wise man
[1:19:13] he built that house he built a
[1:19:15] foundation he built a house that stood
[1:19:17] there and he said when the when the
[1:19:19] storms and everything came against it it
[1:19:21] could not be blown down it had a
[1:19:23] foundation
[1:19:25] and just like that man he had a vision
[1:19:27] of where to build and he dug and he dug
[1:19:29] and he dug until he found the foundation
[1:19:31] and he told him he said this is where we
[1:19:33] going to build everybody else ridiculed
[1:19:35] him but he said you know what I know
[1:19:37] what I'm doing right I've proven it
[1:19:40] that's
[1:19:40] it he said I don't care what you believe
[1:19:43] believe it or not he said I'm going to
[1:19:45] build this bridge he said I dug down and
[1:19:48] I found it and he laid that bridge and
[1:19:50] when it come time to cross it he said
[1:19:52] I'm going to be the first one to cross
[1:19:53] it and I'm going to prove to you that
[1:19:55] this is the foundation it's built just
[1:19:58] exactly right amen that's
[1:20:01] right and see the same thing Jesus came
[1:20:04] and he was the bridge the gap between
[1:20:06] God and man and he came and he came to
[1:20:09] do those things and it didn't matter if
[1:20:10] anybody else agreed with him or not or
[1:20:12] what they done but he came to do that
[1:20:14] because he said the son of man has come
[1:20:15] to seek and save those of which are lost
[1:20:17] and he came and he made it and he
[1:20:19] bridged that Gap and he come across and

[1:22:26] zakus there
[1:22:28] and he was a
[1:22:31] man he cheated and lied and done all
[1:22:36] kinds of stuff to his own
[1:22:38] people you know he was well liked yeah
[1:22:43] he had a he had a lucrative job he
[1:22:46] collected taxes for the Romans yeah and
[1:22:49] you know how he got
[1:22:51] rich he over taxed everybody and then he
[1:22:53] just paid the wrong is what they wanted
[1:22:55] he kept the rest for himself he had a
[1:22:57] lucrative business and you know what
[1:23:00] nobody could stop him cuz he
[1:23:02] was under the under the protection of
[1:23:04] the
[1:23:05] Romans he got to do what he wanted
[1:23:08] to and everybody thought you know he's a
[1:23:11] low down scoundrel nobody liked
[1:23:14] him and you know he probably had that as
[1:23:17] as they call it that little Hitler
[1:23:18] syndrome because he was short of stature
[1:23:20] you know probably carried a chip on his
[1:23:22] shoulder all the time yeah
[1:23:26] a lot of people thought boy you know if
[1:23:27] I found him in a dark alley he wouldn't
[1:23:30] walk
[1:23:32] out but you know what he had a Praying
[1:23:34] Wife yeah drove him
[1:23:41] crazy because you know what he knew the
[1:23:43] truth but he didn't want to live it
[1:23:46] right but you know what God Was
[1:23:48] preparing a way for him that's
[1:23:50] right wife drove him nuts talking about
[1:23:53] Jesus
[1:23:55] and you know he walked
[1:23:58] around he didn't want to hear it but you
[1:24:01] know what it's something brother bham
[1:24:04] said you get salty enough he said you
[1:24:06] make them

[1:24:10] and it kept driving him crazy he said
[1:24:12] well I got to go find out about this
[1:24:15] Jesus all these holy rollers and nuts
[1:24:18] and everybody following this man
[1:24:21] around but you know the scripture said
[1:24:23] that he couldn't get close to Jesus
[1:24:25] because the Press was too great
[1:24:28] right and because he was short of
[1:24:30] stature he couldn't see but you know he
[1:24:33] could have went out there and said okay
[1:24:34] well I
[1:24:35] tried I couldn't get near him I couldn't
[1:24:37] see nothing I just seen a bunch of nuts
[1:24:40] running around everybody yelling at each
[1:24:42] other hosana to the King of Kings hey if
[1:24:46] you're the if you're the Son of God we
[1:24:47] got
[1:24:48] a graveyard up here full of people won't
[1:24:51] you come ra some dead yeah
[1:24:55] all this contention and fighting and
[1:24:56] everything going on he could have just
[1:24:58] said well you know I seen what I
[1:25:01] saw I'm going to the
[1:25:04] house but you know what he made a way
[1:25:06] for
[1:25:08] himself God made a way for him but you
[1:25:10] know what he went out there and you know
[1:25:13] brother Brown talked about you know he
[1:25:14] was wearing his good robes his good
[1:25:16] clothes but he had to go get that trash
[1:25:18] can so he get up in the
[1:25:21] tree you know he was gonna find
[1:25:23] something that day right and he got up
[1:25:25] in that tree and stood there and
[1:25:27] waited but you know what God knew knew
[1:25:30] where his where his each individual is
[1:25:33] God knew where his own are and when he
[1:25:35] come along there he was and he looked up
[1:25:37] in that tree and said zachus come down
[1:25:41] make haste we got to go to your
[1:25:45] house well here's a man that zakus
[1:25:48] didn't know him just the just the guy
[1:25:51] that his wife talked about all the time
[1:25:54] yeah
[1:25:55] how did he know who he was how did he
[1:25:58] know that he was in that
[1:26:01] tree for him to call for him to come
[1:26:04] down and when he came down out of that
[1:26:07] tree then he
[1:26:09] went and he said

[1:26:14] everything I got to the poor yeah he
[1:26:16] said I give half of it he said if I've
[1:26:19] defaed anybody he said I'll restore him
[1:26:21] for fold why because something took

[1:26:28] zachus sitting in that
[1:26:31] tree you know what something God made a
[1:26:34] way through his wife something had
[1:26:36] prepared but you know zachus prepared a
[1:26:38] way for himself
[1:26:40] yeah because something drew him to climb
[1:26:43] up in that tree because he wanted to see
[1:26:46] something and that's when God met
[1:26:48] him see God's made a way for you and I
[1:26:52] but the thing is is have you made the
[1:26:53] way for him to come and meet
[1:26:56] you it may be it may be just like Elijah
[1:26:59] he had to go sit in a in a cave yeah you
[1:27:02] may have to climb a sycamore
[1:27:04] tree it may be climbing over in the pig

[1:30:17] get I get I get praying time in the
[1:30:21] shower but see that you know there
[1:30:23] there's s that when you're by yourself
[1:30:25] that you can talk to God that you're
[1:30:27] just by yourself and all of a sudden God
[1:30:29] can right just drop something and it
[1:30:32] just opens up
[1:30:34] right and sometimes sometimes it's just
[1:30:37] one thought but you know what it takes
[1:30:39] that one thought right sometime
[1:30:42] sometimes it just takes that one piece
[1:30:45] and then over time it just right starts
[1:30:47] to build that's right and that's all
[1:30:49] you're waiting on is that one
[1:30:52] piece and that's what God's here for

[1:41:54] and you go back through notes and
[1:41:56] everything and you just sit there and
[1:41:57] you read and you try to find something
[1:41:59] and you just praying and everything I
[1:42:01] had to preach on the other night you
[1:42:04] could have wrode on a 3x5 card and had a
[1:42:06] lot of left
[1:42:09] over and you just sit there and you
[1:42:11] think well you know what I'm going to go
[1:42:13] up here and I'm going to start with this
[1:42:15] and we'll see where we
[1:42:17] go but you know I I the Lord just come
[1:42:20] and I thought well
[1:42:23] he's the one does the speak and I don't
[1:42:24] I I just show up I'm just going to be
[1:42:27] present but you know the Lord come
[1:42:31] and at work we always have to we always

[1:42:39] pulled my pocket out and
[1:42:41] just I just started writing stuff and
[1:42:44] things just started opening

[1:42:50] don't you you wonder but you know you
[1:42:53] you try not to get in get your mind into
[1:42:55] it because sometimes the devil say well

[1:42:57] nothing you got
[1:43:00] nothing well you know what he spoke the
[1:43:03] world into existence out of nothing so
[1:43:06] that's right that's right there nothing
[1:43:07] there and he spoke and he spoke it in
[1:43:09] the existence so if I got no sermon
[1:43:11] he'll speak one into existence right but
[1:43:14] the Lord just come on the scene and I
[1:43:16] and I went home this I just I just had a
[1:43:18] little bit and I went home and started
[1:43:20] working on it this evening and things
[1:43:22] just started to open

[1:43:27] that
[1:43:28] he's because you just get ready and just
[1:43:32] get prepared right and he'll he'll come
[1:43:35] on the scene and and and give you
[1:43:36] something to say to the people that's
[1:43:38] right and you
[1:43:40] know I learned a long time ago you know
[1:43:43] I I you I wish I could preach like I
[1:43:45] wish like I could preach like brother
[1:43:47] Dale and brother Wade but you know what
[1:43:49] I'm not them and I ain't never going to
[1:43:50] be like them and the day that I figured
[1:43:52] out that never going to be like them
[1:43:55] well praise the Lord cuz you know what
[1:43:56] I'm going to be Aaron
[1:43:58] Roberts because you know what I'm not
[1:44:00] going to be nobody else and I can't be
[1:44:02] like nobody
[1:44:03] else when I figured out who I am that
[1:44:07] that going to be like me then you know
[1:44:08] because I'm going I'm going to spit and
[1:44:11] and yell and scream the rest of them may
[1:44:13] not do that but I'm going to do that cuz
[1:44:14] that's me that's just who I am and you
[1:44:17] know I'm just everywhere I go I just and
[1:44:21] people say you know I I told them
[1:44:23] preached with brother brother Hughes the
[1:44:24] other other Sunday night and and I told
[1:44:27] him I said if y'all had been there
[1:44:29] Sunday night y'all wouldn't even known
[1:44:30] who I
[1:44:33] was if you been if y'all ever been to
[1:44:36] brother Gerald hughes's church I covered
[1:44:38] a lot of the
[1:44:41] platform I cover a lot anywhere let's
[1:44:43] put this way I covered Walking the
[1:44:46] platform as a big one I done a lot of
[1:44:50] walking but I tell you what I I think
[1:44:53] God that I just be who you are God made
[1:44:56] you who you are and you know brother R
[1:44:58] said when you when a person gets born
[1:44:59] again he said if they get born again in
[1:45:01] a in a more of a Pentecostal atmosphere
[1:45:03] they're going to be that type of person
[1:45:05] and he said he said if they're if
[1:45:06] they're more reserved he said they'll be
[1:45:08] more reserved exactly that's right so
[1:45:11] you just who you are cuz God that's how
[1:45:13] God made you that's right and you know I
[1:45:15] just I just am who I am and just thank

[1:45:23] I'm going to be faithful in my little
[1:45:25] pieace amen and God has blessed us to do
[1:45:28] to do what God has given us to do and we
[1:45:31] just want to be faithful in that amen so
[1:45:33] God bless you tonight appreciate each
[1:45:36] one of you continue to remember all the
[1:45:37] ones that are not here with us that are
[1:45:39] sick I think about Brother Gary about
[1:45:41] every day and he's you know I know God's
[1:45:45] with him and you know I
[1:45:49] just you you you look at people and and
[1:45:52] you try to feel bad and sometimes you do
[1:45:55] but you know what God's mindful God's on
[1:45:57] the scene and when God's on the
[1:46:00] scene I think I think of brother dick
[1:46:02] all the time and it was because when
[1:46:05] brother Dick had cancer you know I was
[1:46:07] so I was so
[1:46:09] burdened and I've told I tell every I've
[1:46:11] told this I don't know how many times
[1:46:12] brother dick but I was so burdened
[1:46:13] riding in the truck at
[1:46:18] night and the Lord just dropped down and
[1:46:20] told me he said he said Lazarus was dead
[1:46:24] in the grave four days the scripture
[1:46:27] said that his nose had fallen in he was
[1:46:30] rotten and you know what the great
[1:46:33] physician passed by and diagnosed his
[1:46:36] case and said you know what you're not
[1:46:37] too bad off called for me come right
[1:46:40] up I was riding in the truck that day
[1:46:42] and the Lord told me said you know
[1:46:43] Lazarus was in was in the grave four
[1:46:45] days dead said brother dick ain't got
[1:46:47] that far
[1:46:53] I tell you what it changes your whole
[1:46:54] outlook on
[1:46:55] life
[1:46:57] right and you know I I tell everybody
[1:46:59] that all the time that when you when you
[1:47:01] see things like that if you know if you
[1:47:03] know God's on the
[1:47:06] scene there there's no fear there's
[1:47:08] there's no worry that's right that's
[1:47:10] right you can't worry over that you
[1:47:12] can't be
[1:47:15] sad you know we don't we don't want we
[1:47:18] don't want anybody to have to suffer but
[1:47:20] you know what it's it's part of the
[1:47:21] human condition
[1:47:25] but you know what if God's got it in
[1:47:28] control and the message letting off the
[1:47:30] pressure brother Brown talks about that
[1:47:32] lady said she is 60 years old she looked
[1:47:34] like she is 30 years old and he asked
[1:47:36] her said she had two grown sons he
[1:47:38] couldn't believe she had grown sons and
[1:47:39] said sister how do you do it he said she
[1:47:41] said when I become a Christian she said
[1:47:43] I know I can't carry my own burdens he
[1:47:45] said he was going to take my burdens
[1:47:47] said if he can't take care of it I sure
[1:47:49] can't take care of it so I ain't going
[1:47:50] to worry about it right she said iin
[1:47:52] never had a worry never had a
[1:47:56] care and it never aged
[1:47:58] her that's right so we cast our cares on
[1:48:01] him because he cares for
[1:48:03] us I thank the Lord for that little
[1:48:06] mishap
[1:48:09] today1 because that really I can't get
[1:48:12] that out of my mind it just keeps going

[1:48:17] today and forever he called his
[1:48:20] disciples if we call ourselves
[1:48:22] Christians we are his disciples that's
[1:48:24] right and if we are his disciples he
[1:48:27] gives us power over the devils and over
[1:48:30] all diseases that's right now think
