[37:20] tonight we're not going to take too much
[37:23] time but I want to go to the Book of
[37:25] Genesis
[37:27] chapter
[37:29] 5 verse
[37:33] 21 a scripture that's very well known to
[37:41] us Genesis 5:21 and if you have it say
[37:47] Amen the word of God
[37:52] says and Enoch lived 6 and5 years and
[37:56] beget
[38:00] Methuselah and Enoch walked with
[38:06] God and he begat Methuselah 300 years
[38:09] and begat sons and
[38:14] daughters and all the days of Enoch were
[38:17] 36 and5
[38:24] years and Enoch walked with God and he
[38:26] was not for God took
[38:31] him now in the Book of Joshua chapter 6
[38:35] verse
[38:48] one 61 61
[38:52] okay Joshua 61 now Jericho was
[38:55] straightly shut up because of of the
[38:56] children of Israel none went out and
[38:58] none came
[39:05] in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I
[39:08] have given into thine hand Jericho and
[39:10] the King thereof and the Mighty Man of
[39:18] Valor and ye shall Compass the city all
[39:21] ye man of war and go round about the
[39:24] city once thus shalt thou do six
[39:37] days and seven priests shall bear before
[39:40] the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and
[39:42] the seventh day you shall Compass the
[39:45] city seven times and the priest shall
[39:47] blow with the
[39:55] trumpets
[39:59] [Music]
[40:02] and it shall come to pass that when they
[40:04] make a long blast with the Ram's Horn
[40:06] and when ye hear the sound of the
[40:08] trumpet all the people shall Shout with
[40:10] a great shout and the wall of the city
[40:12] shall fall down flat and the people
[40:14] shall Ascend up every man straight
[40:17] before
[40:19] him let our
[40:22] heads Lord
[40:25] Jesus
[40:27] you know the need of every heart here
[40:30] tonight you know what every person here
[40:33] father is going
[40:35] [Music]
[40:36] through and you also know what every
[40:38] person
[40:41] needs and so father we ask you
[40:46] tonight that you would just come down
[40:48] and take every request every
[40:54] petition and that you would would just
[40:56] bless those each one of those
[40:59] requests Lord we ask
[41:03] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:05] Christ amen amen amen you may be seated
[41:08] for a
[41:10] moment and I trust that with that we be
[41:12] able to enjoy the
[41:17] word we want to we want to talk a little
[41:20] bit about our walk with
[41:24] God we were called for to walk with
[41:30] God we were called to walk in this
[41:35] way we were called to walk in a certain
[41:41] path and that path is the narrow
[41:48] way so when you hear the a narrow way
[41:51] that lets you know that it's not an easy
[41:55] path
[41:58] we know that it has not been easy to
[42:00] come to the place where we are at this
[42:04] moment and I'm not talking about just
[42:06] coming to
[42:13] church because coming to church it was
[42:15] easy because you have the heat on and
[42:17] and you have maybe heated seats or
[42:21] whatever but it's not the same thing
[42:23] coming to church the uh uh uh it's not
[42:26] the same thing coming to church then
[42:28] compared to coming to the
[42:30] word it's
[42:33] different you can come to church all
[42:36] every
[42:38] day and maybe we might forget that every
[42:41] time that we've come to
[42:44] church but we come to the word one
[42:51] time I don't think we forgotten that
[42:53] experience that we had when we came to
[42:55] the word
[42:58] I can't forget the time when I came to
[42:59] the
[43:01] word let me tell you I was born in this
[43:07] message I I was born in this
[43:14] faith when my when my when I was when my
[43:16] parents gave birth to me they they
[43:18] already knew the
[43:20] message but it's one thing to be in the
[43:25] message another thing is for the message
[43:27] to be inside of
[43:29] you and that's the difference in the
[43:32] time that we are living
[43:35] in we have people that come to the
[43:39] message but we need that that message
[43:42] get inside of
[43:45] them we have people that carry the
[43:50] message people that go to church and
[43:52] they carry the
[43:55] Bible
[43:57] and when we were traveling when we on in
[43:59] the car while ago and going through
[44:01] these
[44:01] [Music]
[44:03] cities I saw many churches around the
[44:06] the the the the
[44:09] [Applause]
[44:12] cities and I imagine that many people
[44:14] are going to go to church here in this
[44:16] New Year's
[44:19] time but it's not the same thing to
[44:22] carry the
[44:25] Bible
[44:26] but that the Bibles be inside of
[44:30] you we are in the correct
[44:36] way you don't have to be doubting that
[44:39] this is the right
[44:42] way there are people that are leaving
[44:44] this
[44:46] way remember the vision that brother
[44:48] brandham
[44:53] had those those women they were walking
[44:55] there on in that
[44:59] line but when that Vision was about to
[45:04] close there were some that were moving
[45:07] from side to side and they were getting
[45:08] out of
[45:10] step and let me tell you
[45:13] tonight it's not easy to stay in the
[45:17] way but there is only one
[45:23] way I've read about many men throughout
[45:26] the
[45:27] history very great
[45:30] philosophers great
[45:33] men but I only know
[45:36] one they had the sufficient
[45:41] Valor to say that I am the way the truth
[45:44] and the
[45:45] life and I'm very happy
[45:51] tonight to tell you that I serve The God
[45:54] Who said I am the way the truth and the
[45:56] life hallelujah
[45:58] hallelujah glory to
[46:01] God blessed be his
[46:03] name feel happy
[46:06] tonight that you are serving a living
[46:11] God you're not serving a God that
[46:13] doesn't
[46:15] move in Honduras we have a lot of
[46:21] paganism the people go and they and they
[46:23] they bow down to little statues
[46:30] last month in my city they had a little
[46:33] celebration and they have a a holy
[46:38] Patron and his name is San
[46:41] Diego and he can't
[46:44] move but the people ask of him
[46:49] Miracles and they and they take out
[46:51] their money and they give it to San
[46:54] Diego and they tell him they ask him San
[46:57] Diego please help me to get some
[47:03] work and San Diego please help me that
[47:06] that so that I can be
[47:08] healed but San Diego can't even
[47:16] move San Diego ever since I've known him
[47:19] since I was a little kid he's in this
[47:20] position the whole
[47:22] [Applause]
[47:24] time
[47:27] when San Diego gets dirty somebody has
[47:29] to wipe his
[47:32] face he can't even clean his own
[47:36] face but for you it's
[47:39] funny but those people have faith in San
[47:43] Diego you know why that's funny to
[47:47] you because you know that that's
[47:50] false and you know why that's funny to
[47:54] you because you know a God that does
[47:59] move because you know a God that can
[48:05] answer so for God to answer you need to
[48:08] speak to him in
[48:11] faith if you have faith
[48:14] tonight don't
[48:16] worry you you'll leave this place
[48:21] differently all you had to do is bring a
[48:23] bit of
[48:24] faith
[48:26] because the word of God is
[48:28] here the holy spirit is
[48:32] here when the Holy Spirit connects with
[48:36] faith and when that Faith takes us to
[48:38] the
[48:39] word the Bible say ask and it shall be
[48:42] given to you hallelujah
[48:46] hallelujah can you give him a clap of
[48:48] Praise hallelujah
[48:51] [Applause]
[48:53] hallelujah we serve a God that's alive
[48:58] Liv but you need to call him by
[49:01] faith hallelujah
[49:06] hallelujah you know
[49:09] faith is compared to one of our our our
[49:15] senses you know that we have five
[49:19] senses with one we can
[49:22] [Music]
[49:24] see I can see that my wife is back
[49:29] there and my faith tells me my sight
[49:32] tells me she's the most beautiful that's
[49:34] in here yeah amen
[49:37] [Laughter]
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:42] right someone said someone said no
[49:46] because that's not your
[49:47] [Laughter]
[49:49] wife glory to
[49:53] God but you see that's what our fa our
[49:56] our eyesight is
[49:59] declaring but there is another sense
[50:02] that declares
[50:08] taste none of you can tell me how this
[50:10] water tastes
[50:15] like only my taste buds are able to to
[50:18] to
[50:20] know you can't tell me how it smells
[50:22] like
[50:24] either
[50:26] I can tell brother Aaron that water
[50:27] smells like
[50:31] strawberries and I can tell him well I
[50:34] don't smell that or you can tell me I
[50:36] don't smell
[50:40] that but my my sense of smell declares
[50:45] that we have five senses
[50:49] church but let me tell you
[50:52] something these five senses can fail you
[50:58] amen sometimes you can see
[51:01] things that seem like they're right or
[51:04] they're
[51:05] true but they're not
[51:08] true you can smell something
[51:13] right and your sense of smell could fail
[51:17] you you could hear
[51:21] something and you can say tell me again
[51:24] because I heard it wrong
[51:27] that shows that your five
[51:31] senses but when God made his
[51:35] bride when God made his
[51:40] elective he gave a six sense to you and
[51:46] me you know when my when my when my eyes
[51:49] sight
[51:52] fails my six sense cannot fail
[51:59] because my sick sense can only rest in
[52:01] one
[52:04] place it can only rest in this
[52:07] word
[52:10] amen when I have that six sense placed
[52:13] on
[52:16] this it doesn't matter what comes to my
[52:21] ear the doctor May tell me I cannot get
[52:24] healed
[52:26] it doesn't matter to
[52:28] me I can see that maybe I'm not getting
[52:33] better but that doesn't matter
[52:38] either I can feel that in my body I'm
[52:41] not getting
[52:43] better but that doesn't matter
[52:47] either because we have a six
[52:53] sense and my has always points me back
[52:57] to what he's done for
[52:58] me
[53:02] Brethren the doctors can do their
[53:07] job but when they're done with what they
[53:10] know what to
[53:12] do then we have a better place to go
[53:16] to there is you don't have to get
[53:20] depressed there's been thousands of
[53:23] years that have gone by but the word
[53:26] continues to
[53:27] say by his stripes I've been
[53:31] healed amenu
[53:34] Hallelujah that's what faith
[53:39] does now you might tell me brother I
[53:42] I've gone to
[53:44] church and I haven't felt one
[53:47] thing the only thing I feel is
[53:52] sleepy I go to church because my parents
[53:55] parents take me to
[53:57] church I go to church because if not my
[54:00] dad will get
[54:02] upset but if it was up to
[54:05] me I would be at at the
[54:09] house watching
[54:11] Instagram or Facebook or Facebook or
[54:14] Twitter or
[54:19] Twitter to see which one is the mo you
[54:21] know the modern uh singer of the day
[54:26] to see what Netflix is showing
[54:31] right but my parents bring me here and I
[54:33] don't feel anything at
[54:36] church I don't blame anyone that feels
[54:39] that way no
[54:42] [Applause]
[54:43] no I believe that those people they
[54:51] say if I could just feel God just a
[54:54] little bit
[54:56] I would be
[54:59] different but let me tell you God is
[55:01] here
[55:04] today you might say that man's
[55:07] crazy the people in Honduras they're
[55:11] crazy is there any other Crazy Ones
[55:15] here there it's a it's a it's a crazy
[55:18] house
[55:23] here Welcome to the hous spoken
[55:27] word because we have crazy people
[55:31] here there in
[55:34] heaven there's a there's a bigger crazy
[55:37] house
[55:38] there and they're crazy like
[55:42] us they're they're there and they're
[55:44] waiting for
[55:45] us Paul
[55:48] said by the the craziness of preaching
[55:52] the
[55:54] foolishness and it was that's how it
[55:56] pleased him to save the
[55:58] world you know why you don't feel
[56:01] it because you haven't received
[56:05] it brother Brandon was a young
[56:08] man I'm not taking too much
[56:12] time I don't see you sleeping yet so
[56:14] we're still
[56:19] good the first time the the sign will be
[56:22] the first when the first one does that
[56:27] and you're going to I'm going to be
[56:28] thinking that what you want me to do is
[56:30] get down to
[56:33] stop are we okay all
[56:36] right brother Brandon was a young
[56:39] man and he preached in the uh in the
[56:44] Parks and he was a young man preaching
[56:46] in the
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] parks there was an older gentleman that
[56:52] came to
[56:53] him
[56:56] [Applause]
[56:58] and he asked brother Bram he said uh you
[57:00] get you uh you need to prove to me about
[57:02] that God that you're preaching
[57:04] about prove to me that he's
[57:09] real if you prove to me that he's real
[57:12] then I'll believe the way you
[57:14] believe and brother Brandon being a
[57:16] young
[57:18] man he said to him I believe it because
[57:20] it's written in the
[57:23] word so the man told him he said that's
[57:26] not sufficient for
[57:28] me show it to me that he's
[57:32] real and brother Brandon felt like he
[57:34] was
[57:35] defeated he did not know how to respond
[57:38] to this man but the Bible
[57:42] says that if you stand for God God will
[57:45] stand for
[57:49] you and at that
[57:52] moment the Holy Spirit came down

[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:02] walk just as Joshua was in a
[1:02:10] walk they they were told to go and
[1:02:13] possess the the the
[1:02:17] land that land was a was a promise to
[1:02:21] them how many believe that
[1:02:28] nobody could
[1:02:30] stop that they get to that
[1:02:34] Land There was the one that was that was
[1:02:37] the the the Red Sea the red the Red
[1:02:44] Sea I I didn't hear what he had said so
[1:02:47] I heard something red
[1:02:48] [Laughter]
[1:02:53] and
[1:02:55] and I ask you
[1:02:57] tonight did the Red Sea stop them no
[1:03:03] no the the the there were bitter
[1:03:07] Waters did the bitter Waters stop
[1:03:11] them they were in the
[1:03:15] desert did the desert stop
[1:03:20] them why did none of those things stop
[1:03:23] them
[1:03:26] it was because they were predestined to
[1:03:28] get to that
[1:03:32] land they were elected to come to to get
[1:03:35] to that
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] land now I want to ask you tonight with
[1:03:41] faith in your
[1:03:43] heart do you believe that God chose
[1:03:46] you
[1:03:48] amen now let me tell
[1:03:51] you God doesn't make mistakes he right
[1:03:56] if God chose
[1:04:03] you God is not practicing on you or he's
[1:04:06] not
[1:04:08] learning he knows what he has
[1:04:12] done the pastor couldn't couldn't bring
[1:04:18] them I'm sorry the pastor couldn't bring
[1:04:20] you the a brother couldn't bring you in
[1:04:25] it had to be God drawing
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:29] you and don't forget that in your
[1:04:34] heart when when the Devil comes in and
[1:04:36] then throws those things in your
[1:04:43] mind you can say Satan I've been brought
[1:04:46] here by the Holy
[1:04:48] Spirit I've been elected by the Holy
[1:04:53] Spirit that's what makes the
[1:04:56] difference if man brought you
[1:04:59] here the man can take you out of the
[1:05:03] way but if God brought you in this
[1:05:09] way there is nothing or nothing nobody
[1:05:12] that can take you out of this
[1:05:16] way there is no trial that can take you
[1:05:19] out of this
[1:05:21] way there is no sickness that can take
[1:05:23] you out this
[1:05:25] way because God is not
[1:05:28] learning the prophet
[1:05:30] said God doesn't save you
[1:05:33] today to lose you
[1:05:37] tomorrow God didn't save you on the
[1:05:39] cross of
[1:05:41] calary to lose you here in
[1:05:45] 2023 if God saved
[1:05:48] you he did it
[1:05:50] today and he did it forever for eternity
[1:05:55] you're saved by
[1:05:57] grace you're not saved by the things you
[1:06:01] do you're saved for what he did for you
[1:06:05] on
[1:06:05] Calvary glory to
[1:06:09] God nothing could detain the the
[1:06:12] children of
[1:06:14] Israel nothing could stop them now
[1:06:16] they're a shadow of of
[1:06:19] us now we're in this
[1:06:22] way and you're in this
[1:06:26] way you can only
[1:06:30] Advance or only move
[1:06:36] backwards you can't stay
[1:06:39] still that's right brother

[1:13:07] walls but God had told
[1:13:10] him not that you were going to walk up
[1:13:14] or climb up
[1:13:16] Jericho but you were going to walk
[1:13:19] through

[1:13:59] faith but nothing
[1:14:05] happened the sixth day

[1:14:12] Trumpeter he prepared his

[1:14:18] the previous
[1:14:21] Trumpeter without holiness no one will
[1:14:23] see the
[1:14:25] lord and there inside of Jericho
[1:14:29] walls there was a lady
[1:14:33] there and she's hearing the sound of
[1:14:36] every
[1:14:38] trumpet and as the trumpet was
[1:14:41] sounding She Was preparing
[1:14:45] herself do you know who I'm talking
[1:14:49] about I'm talking about
[1:14:52] Rahab
[1:14:54] R have had a sign that was placed on her
[1:14:58] house R have had received a
[1:15:02] message and now the sound of the
[1:15:06] trumpet with the sound of the

[1:15:13] herself and let me tell you tonight the
[1:15:15] trumpet is
[1:15:18] sounding and we are walking in the right
[1:15:21] way glory to God
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:30] it seems like nothing is
[1:15:31] happening we go to
[1:15:34] church did something happen no
[1:15:38] nothing it's the same
[1:15:40] message brother Aon
[1:15:42] preached I slept a little
[1:15:45] bit nothing
[1:15:50] happened and we come back to church like
[1:15:52] as if nothing or we leave church like
[1:15:55] nothing but something is
[1:15:58] happening something is
[1:16:02] changing every day that H that that
[1:16:04] takes that goes by there's a someone's
[1:16:07] taking an extra
[1:16:09] step another step
[1:16:13] ahead as that as that that colored lady
[1:16:17] said I'm not what I'd like to
[1:16:22] be I'm not what I should
[1:16:24] be but one thing I
[1:16:27] know I'm not what I used to
[1:16:30] be what is that it's because we're
[1:16:33] walking on a
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:36] journey and when the sixth day
[1:16:40] came I love
[1:16:47] this because really the sound of the
[1:16:50] trumpet was not what made the wall
[1:16:54] fall come on
[1:16:56] brother the prophet
[1:16:59] said that when the people
[1:17:02] shouted
[1:17:05] remember the trumpet
[1:17:08] sounded but the people also shouted as
[1:17:12] well and I believe that the trumpet
[1:17:17] sounded the seventh Trumpeter sounded
[1:17:19] the
[1:17:21] trumpet but now
[1:17:24] we have taken the
[1:17:25] book so that it be
[1:17:28] John who prophesies
[1:17:32] again it's time for the people to
[1:17:37] shout but in the middle of the shouting
[1:17:39] of the
[1:17:40] people the prophet
[1:17:43] says that the shout of the
[1:17:47] King was in the middle of the campu
[1:17:52] Hallelujah and do you do you see what we
[1:17:55] believe do you see what we have
[1:17:58] received it's time that you take the
[1:18:01] message that you take the
[1:18:04] word and stand for what that word
[1:18:08] says because the Shad of the king is in
[1:18:10] the middle of the
[1:18:12] camp
[1:18:17] amen it's not just me and brother Luis
[1:18:20] preaching
[1:18:21] here but it's his voice speaking to
[1:18:26] you telling you to keep moving on do not
[1:18:30] give
[1:18:31] up it seems like nothing's
[1:18:34] happening the devil will tell you
[1:18:38] nothing's happening you're wasting your
[1:18:41] time you tell the devil on his
[1:18:45] face and you tell him I'm wasting I'm
