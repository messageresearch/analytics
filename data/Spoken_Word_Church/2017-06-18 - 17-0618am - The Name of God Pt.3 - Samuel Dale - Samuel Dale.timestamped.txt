[9:21] alright let's just the very familiar
[9:25] scripture with all of us and all and
[9:28] remember to sister Monica and sister
[9:31] Anna's classes will be practicing at
[9:35] 12:50 today between the services and
[9:38] also just bring them all up here okay
[9:41] very familiar Scripture and look what
[9:45] Jesus said he said I and my father are
[9:49] one it's as simple as any language could
[9:53] be it doesn't have to be interpreted it
[9:58] doesn't have to be explained it has to
[10:02] be believed because that's what he said
[10:05] alright let's go to Ephesians now and
[10:07] we'll go to 3 verse 14
[10:13] accent excuse me I better get my
[10:16] scriptures right I better get Exodus
[10:18] myself I've had it well I've got mine
[10:22] written Ephesians I want to read these
[10:24] it okay we'll read Exodus later on I
[10:27] said I've got mine of Ephesians and I
[10:30] wanted to read that those are the
[10:33] thoughts and things that we're in
[10:35] cohesion 3:14 says for this cause I by
[10:40] my knees under the father of our Lord
[10:42] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[10:45] heaven and earth his name and he would
[10:51] grant to you according to the riches of
[10:53] his glory to be strengthened with might
[10:56] by his spirit in the inner man the whole
[11:00] family all the way brings it to the
[11:03] inner man you may be seated the Lord at
[11:06] his blessing to the reading of the word
[11:08] now we have been placed to services
[11:14] we've been talking on a very familiar
[11:18] thought with all of us but as I just
[11:21] wanted you to keep in mind and think
[11:23] about the things and I've asked the
[11:26] question over and over in this series
[11:31] part we're talking and we're talking
[11:33] about the name of God the name of God
[11:40] now Jesus said during the scriptures in
[11:43] John he said I come in my father's name
[11:50] well you know if you go in your father's
[11:54] name a son always go or children always
[11:57] go in the name of the Father now then
[12:00] that way my my children are not is
[12:04] always saying oh come back here by that
[12:06] name but always say that my kids are not
[12:10] McGillicuddy's it's just a name I use
[12:13] see they are Dales because they come in
[12:18] my name all right and see Jesus when he
[12:21] said I come in my father's name
[12:24] he wouldn't talk in about a second
[12:27] person we don't believe that we believe
[12:29] in one true and living God all right we
[12:32] don't believe in God in three persons
[12:34] we've been through that through the the
[12:36] errors of time and brought it out and we
[12:39] believe the Word of God to be true and
[12:42] even the first commandment is would
[12:45] break up the Trinity where it says you
[12:48] know that there's just one God all right
[12:50] now we tried to be you know all the way
[12:54] through and talking about the things in
[12:56] the scriptures about the name of God and
[12:59] seeing like I said you'd say to most
[13:01] people you say what's the name of God
[13:02] it's God it was God well they even make
[13:07] a God out of anytime because not to just
[13:11] say his name is God God simply means an
[13:15] object of worship alright we've been
[13:19] through the Old Testament we came up to
[13:23] our Wednesday bringing it up to the part
[13:26] of of Jesus Christ when he was born on
[13:28] earth as a child and see they named him
[13:32] Jesus but what didn't they call him as
[13:36] the Bible had said in Isaiah that you'll
[13:39] call his name Emmanuel but they didn't
[13:47] call him Emmanuel they called him Jesus
[13:49] why because Gabriel told Mary to call
[13:55] his name Jesus because he saved his
[13:59] people from their sins alright we've
[14:01] been through the mini title see god is
[14:04] just a title oh you know you want to
[14:07] check for a million dollars I'll write
[14:09] it out and sign it garden you want to go
[14:11] to the bank with it wouldn't work too
[14:16] good with it that's not jokes that's not
[14:18] things that say anything wrong this
[14:20] truth thing because that word God is
[14:24] just meaning an object of worship it's a
[14:26] title just like in the Old Testament
[14:29] when you start out in Genesis it starts
[14:32] talking about God and that's derived
[14:34] from the word Elohim which means self
[14:37] exist
[14:38] one all right now see that's not his
[14:42] name
[14:43] it's not it's not L ahem you got people
[14:45] today you know that that say the name of
[14:47] God is Yahweh you've got this group
[14:51] believing this way that way all of those
[14:52] Yahweh Jehovah l ahem
[14:57] all of those are titles and they have
[15:02] connection to Almighty God because
[15:04] that's where to develop from because
[15:06] when they said when they looked at what
[15:08] they were trying to define to bring into
[15:12] being into the English language and
[15:16] things they would look and they'd see
[15:18] wordings and and they try to translate
[15:21] or translator doesn't translate by
[15:22] revelation he's not supposed to do that
[15:25] he doesn't he's not supposed to put his
[15:28] thoughts into it he's supposed to
[15:30] translate by literal words and telling
[15:35] you what that word is okay and that's
[15:39] where he translates so then Jehovah
[15:42] means like a father with his family but
[15:45] that's not a that's not his name
[15:47] you say an Old Testament they called him
[15:49] Jehovah yeah but we gave you the
[15:51] scriptures our worries were God Himself
[15:53] said by my my my name Jehovah was I
[15:56] never known C then you say well yeah he
[16:01] was called this out of the others right
[16:02] but they couldn't pronounce that word
[16:05] it's jva too they couldn't pronounce it
[16:09] so they've done the best they could do
[16:11] and it made it Jehovah but that's not
[16:14] the correct understanding all right now
[16:18] so we went through the many many things
[16:20] of you can call him I am you can call
[16:23] him Rose of Sharon Lillie the valley
[16:25] bright and morning star Alpha Omega
[16:28] beginning in father son Holy Ghost all
[16:31] of that is titled to a name right you
[16:36] you know like me I I was a General
[16:40] Motors employee that's one title no all
[16:43] right then I'm a pastor that's another
[16:45] title and I'm a father that's another
[16:48] time but that's not my name
[16:50] me that that won't connect see but then
[16:55] when you say same you'll say wait a
[16:57] minute that's mana then I know my knife
[16:59] come on and see then in the Bible as
[17:03] they were trying to translate it down
[17:06] they brought it down to the name of
[17:10] Jesus right because really they didn't
[17:16] translate it now listen what I'm saying
[17:18] the scholars never translated it to come
[17:21] out to Jesus
[17:22] the angel Gabriel told him what to call
[17:25] him the scholars translated it to come
[17:30] to Emmanuelle
[17:34] right but see when it was finished
[17:38] it couldn't be Manuel so they understood
[17:42] Emmanuel you know was not his name
[17:46] but his name is Jesus so much
[17:49] self-awareness that's what I want you to
[17:52] think simple his name is Jesus it's
[17:58] always been his night that wasn't used
[18:01] in the Old Testament under the form of
[18:04] Jesus written in your scriptures it
[18:08] would use the titles of I am Jehovah and
[18:10] all like that but remember what we were
[18:12] trying to get at see there's no
[18:16] salvation in to say the name of Jehovah
[18:21] there's no salvation and to say hello
[18:25] him the salvation comes in the name of
[18:31] Jesus Christ because the Bible says that
[18:34] there's none other name given under
[18:36] heaven
[18:36] we're bided it we're to be saved but
[18:39] under the name of Jesus all right so
[18:42] Jesus is the very name of God
[18:44] now we're not oneness our Jesus only but
[18:48] they had their places back at the turn
[18:52] of the century we'll get to it a little
[18:54] bit they begin to develop into what they
[18:58] would call the Jesus only people you
[19:01] know are the oneness and they had
[19:04] truth because the name was coming back
[19:07] into understanding of the name of Jesus
[19:10] and what it meant but they didn't just
[19:14] say well okay
[19:15] his name is yet you know we just ride it
[19:17] out Jesus I was showing my wife a little
[19:21] point dark that you're to look some of
[19:24] the wording sometimes and I showed it
[19:26] curve of an emphatic die Glocke two
[19:30] different ways of spelling the name of
[19:32] Jesus and there's only a few verses
[19:33] apart we get it's the name Jesus all
[19:41] right see there like I've always tried
[19:43] to tell you when you see things in the
[19:45] Bible in Genesis it says God created God
[19:50] created God created the Genesis - or did
[19:54] it say Lord God reach the Bible it just
[19:59] it just goes up to the Lord God why
[20:01] because something else was coming into
[20:03] view but is there can be no salvation
[20:07] entitles you guys where you Catholic
[20:12] Church tried to put it father son Holy
[20:14] Ghost back in the dark ages and that
[20:16] won't work there's no salvation in
[20:18] titles I don't care what title you call
[20:21] him there's no salvation
[20:23] there's only salvation in the name of
[20:25] Jesus Christ alright see then that way
[20:28] we can know for sure D where our truth
[20:31] is that in the word to find the name of
[20:34] Jesus right and see that what that means
[20:38] to us we read there and everything in
[20:43] heaven everything in earth is named
[20:45] Jesus then we know everything's not
[20:49] named Jesus what's otama he's talking
[20:51] about God and his offspring we claim to
[20:57] be the children of God cry by the new
[21:00] birth you and I are sons and daughters
[21:01] of a living God right so what is your
[21:04] father's none and remember Jesus at the
[21:09] resurrection remember - resurrection was
[21:13] appearing to Mary and what did he say
[21:17] he said I go to my god and your God he
[21:23] said I go to my father and your father
[21:28] Richard I'm here
[21:29] alright so now then if we are their
[21:33] children of God then and then we would
[21:39] call it from the Bible terminologies the
[21:41] Bride of Christ his wife wife takes on
[21:46] the name right I mean my wife maiden
[21:51] name was cash well uh don't ask me ever
[21:55] to do a wedding to wear that you women
[21:58] would keep your maiden name I won't do
[22:00] it I don't care what you're saying I'm
[22:03] not going to do it because you're not
[22:05] supposed to go that way you're supposed
[22:08] to relinquish your name and take the
[22:10] name of the husband right and see as the
[22:14] children of God then our father's name
[22:17] is Jesus when you say we but but that's
[22:25] that's this - no that's not - simple
[22:27] less or true his name is Jesus within
[22:32] you are missus because you're taking on
[22:39] the name of your husband and as the
[22:43] children of God we take it on the name
[22:45] of our Father
[22:46] so our father's name is Jesus that's the
[22:52] only name that God ever had
[22:53] everything else is titled everything
[22:57] else's means is there means a door got a
[23:02] meaning to it
[23:03] with the name of Jesus and I've been
[23:06] trying to make a simple point to you
[23:08] know title so I am Yahweh anything
[23:18] no title can contain the entire meaning
[23:22] of God
[23:24] no title cam are you listening
[23:29] with the name of Jesus is the entire
[23:33] full meaning of Almighty God so it takes
[23:36] all of those titles that's why I came
[23:38] through the Old Testament it took four
[23:40] thousand years to bring forth Christ
[23:44] upon the earth you know not if they
[23:48] didn't pronounce through the word Jesus
[23:49] back there is get the point the point is
[23:54] that Jesus Christ is our Savior right
[23:58] the Flex man was not in the Old
[24:01] Testament we got this little sentence
[24:03] you know he was not back guarding flags
[24:06] but he was back there to show many
[24:10] titles and many references pointing down
[24:13] within one day God didn't even choose a
[24:20] prophet to bring tonight yet he did to
[24:23] their convenience a Jehovah he was
[24:26] trying to say the name Jesus when he
[24:28] said an angel Gabriel straight from
[24:31] glory to deliver to Mary the name to
[24:40] call the baby alright then we went to
[24:45] that even when it when he went over when
[24:47] Mary went to Elizabeth and Elizabeth was
[24:50] pregnant about six months with Little
[24:52] John learn but he hadn't moved your mama
[24:55] said but when the name of Jesus was
[24:58] proclaimed he leaked in his mother's
[25:02] womb it's not just j esus you know
[25:10] there's plenty of Jesus's in the world
[25:13] today but there's only one Lord Jesus
[25:16] Christ there's many people can say my
[25:20] name is Jesus but we don't worship them
[25:24] because there's one Lord Jesus Christ
[25:27] the Bible said in his name one sitting
[25:34] all of the titles that's what I've been
[25:36] getting to you look at you take all of
[25:38] those titles
[25:42] that you can bring up and when you do
[25:45] all of them put together equals out to
[25:49] Jesus because that's the only name God
[25:55] ever had show me another night you said
[25:58] well Yahweh's don't know go back and
[26:00] find out where it come from those things
[26:03] were titled to a nine just like Jehovah
[26:08] just like Elohim just like only it was
[26:10] titles to a name but it wasn't the name
[26:13] I have many titles but my name is Samuel
[26:20] and season by being a Dale I came in my
[26:24] father's name Dale did what we should
[26:33] think about is looking at Jesus Christ
[26:42] to see who he really is
[26:45] that has God real to you or is he just a
[26:48] spirit I know the Bible or the 5:24 God
[26:53] is a spirit John 5:20 they the worst we
[26:56] must worship in spirit and truth as
[26:58] truly know God's real cause not justice
[27:03] thoughts of your imagination
[27:05] that's all of these other of
[27:07] philosophies bill Indian he worshipped
[27:11] the moon the stars and the thing and he
[27:14] would get down and pray until he would
[27:18] feel uh 19 all religions dealing that
[27:24] way right some spiritual anointing and
[27:28] he would be contacting what he thought
[27:30] with God but see you don't have to get
[27:38] down and pray come on ain't doing away
[27:41] with prayer I'm trying to put it in
[27:42] right place listen you don't have to get
[27:45] down and pray to be able to contact God
[27:50] why don't you just open up your heart
[27:52] and talk to it
[27:55] yeah but I got to get this away I got to
[27:57] pray over here I got to get on my knees
[27:58] I got to do that where's that in the
[28:01] Bible yeah somebody about ready to whack
[28:07] your head off you ain't got time to ask
[28:10] him let you pray you better start
[28:14] believin right so what is Pryor that's
[28:21] the point I've been emphasizing prayer
[28:24] is a contact you know say between you
[28:29] and God
[28:30] but do you have to pray out loud for him
[28:34] to hear you he hears the very whispers
[28:42] and thoughts of your heart the Bible
[28:46] says pray without ceasing write the
[28:51] scripture
[28:51] oh you don't want to do that but you
[28:54] know the monks setting upon him healed
[28:56] roles are they get in there and they
[28:58] pray all day long there's one they get
[29:00] up and go down and pray all day long now
[29:03] that would be praying without ceasing
[29:05] but you can't do that
[29:07] right we got to make a living we got to
[29:09] work we got a little got to do so what
[29:13] does it mean to pray without ceasing
[29:15] keep the right mental attitude in your
[29:18] thoughts and you can talk to God all day
[29:22] long and nobody hears it but you ain't
[29:26] God because he knows our very intensive
[29:32] our heart he knows the reason why we're
[29:34] praying there certainly but it's like
[29:37] I've asked you before why is it that we
[29:40] can call Jesus one time we can pray and
[29:43] seemingly even maybe get anointed and
[29:46] feel good about and it not come to pass
[29:51] then sometimes you're just walking alone
[29:54] and something that seems to contact you
[29:57] and speak to you except IQ Jesus you
[30:01] know what you go find out what you've
[30:02] been asking for takes place
[30:06] my point is could it be not just trying
[30:11] to find letters on the page to be able
[30:13] to pronounce the name but to find out
[30:17] that that name is the name of a person
[30:20] is your god real as read just the
[30:25] thoughts of your mind
[30:26] remember what I said about the Indians
[30:28] he worships he feels the spirit he puts
[30:34] some kind of a name to his god and
[30:38] Infeld times but is that all we want to
[30:43] do and I'm kind of like the old feller
[30:47] said that time you know when they talk
[30:49] about all this
[30:50] praying the Catholics want you to come
[30:53] pray to the Virgin Mary and she prays
[30:55] for you or pray to this me for you I'm
[30:58] not going off on them I'm just making a
[31:00] point
[31:00] I like what the old man said it was in
[31:02] trouble he said when I'm in trouble I
[31:05] don't have to go through no secretary
[31:07] that I want to talk to the head man you
[31:11] know I don't have to go through somebody
[31:13] else all right so what are we talking
[31:16] about the name of Jesus you can call
[31:24] that name Jesus what about an axe you
[31:28] remember what the guys they they decided
[31:31] that they were going to seven of them
[31:35] were sons of school isn't running seven
[31:37] of them they decided but they were going
[31:39] to go down because they seen Paul and
[31:41] then singing praying and they've seen
[31:44] things take place
[31:45] and they could hear him praying in the
[31:47] name of Jesus and the new thing and they
[31:50] decided that go pray not remember the
[31:54] scripture and said we're dirty or the
[31:58] demons you know in the name of Jesus
[32:02] whom Paul preaches I said you had it
[32:09] lined up with a name and you had a good
[32:12] representation to go with it as to what
[32:15] Paul preaches
[32:18] but you know what happened to them the
[32:20] demons jumped on them and tore them up
[32:24] so it's not to just say Jesus but to
[32:30] know who you're praying to
[32:32] it's been the whole point I've tried to
[32:35] make is to know who you praying to do
[32:39] you know him as your personal Savior or
[32:45] you just know what somebody else told
[32:46] you about him
[32:47] or somebody else told you you got to do
[32:49] this somebody else said you got to
[32:50] repent somebody else says you got to be
[32:52] baptized somebody else says you got to
[32:54] do this or have you experienced that
[32:57] because only by personal experience see
[33:01] Paul had a personal experience of Jesus
[33:03] Christ right those sons of scuba they
[33:08] were just going by what they thought he
[33:10] said so they were saying what somebody
[33:11] else said remember that don't work it's
[33:16] a personal revelation they asked him
[33:20] there in the book of Acts you know whose
[33:22] unit the other day where they said how
[33:25] did this man wind up he'll they said
[33:29] through faith not just the name says the
[33:34] name and faith in the name that made
[33:37] this mental whole not just the name and
[33:41] not to just say some faith or thought
[33:44] they put a name with it see jesus said
[33:49] ask anything in my name and I'll give it
[33:53] to you you saying I know you if you'll
[33:58] just think truthfully you prayed and
[34:00] pray and you thought you contacted God
[34:02] you got feelings you got emotions you
[34:05] got things that we believe in all of
[34:07] that God is in the Bible but somehow it
[34:11] just didn't seem to work within a time
[34:16] happens if something just happens in
[34:20] this you just receive a knowledge it
[34:23] read it anyway you've been healed by
[34:26] confessing God's Word but that's what
[34:28] we're supposed to do we're supposed to
[34:29] keep confession it
[34:31] but confess that he's already healed us
[34:33] not confessed for him to healers confess
[34:36] that he's already healed us thank him
[34:38] for it because you're reminding him of
[34:43] what he says in his word you know you
[34:47] know God I don't think God gets upset
[34:50] because we remind him what he said
[34:52] I think he's glad of that I think he
[34:56] said well my children or just like me
[34:58] remember God takes his own word he's got
[35:02] to believe his own word to be right
[35:05] he said conda believes on what he does
[35:07] don't he
[35:10] we see that's what I'm trying to get at
[35:12] are we trying to find letters on a page
[35:15] they would spell out Jehovah some way
[35:18] that they could finally derive now to
[35:20] get that jvh you and they could derive
[35:24] it and bring it out and make it at some
[35:26] kind of a great name they said we got
[35:30] the name of God well they just wasted
[35:35] time but the Bible said to call his name
[35:38] Jesus we're not taking from that order
[35:45] of what you're thinking about and think
[35:49] about is he a person to you I know a
[35:54] silly things and I'm like points and
[35:56] whole but I try that's my wife yesterday
[36:02] I said you called up wait on the
[36:04] telephone and wait answers do you think
[36:08] you're talking to terrorize No
[36:20] I know it's not care us if I hear the
[36:23] voice and it wasn't care us a call you
[36:26] know what I mean is it right he said
[36:33] what are you getting now do you know its
[36:35] name enough to know who the person is
[36:39] remember if he's got a name now here's
[36:43] our point listen if he's got a name he's
[36:46] a person spirits and things like those
[36:55] things is not they don't have names it
[37:00] takes something that God created the
[37:02] Angels but then when he did he moved
[37:03] them in and some wound up with names why
[37:06] because they wound up being closer to
[37:07] what they are but what about a name now
[37:13] you call somebody on the phone let them
[37:14] say you call somebody on the telephone
[37:16] and you say okay you know it's very hard
[37:19] for me to disguise my voice I call most
[37:24] everything you say brother Dale you
[37:26] don't who is it
[37:27] you don't do like that you know who it
[37:29] is why because you've heard my voice so
[37:32] long until it's part of your thinking
[37:34] well not really not listen to what I'm
[37:36] getting at sorry I just try to make
[37:39] something simple I know it I confuse and
[37:42] make a good still I try you realize that
[37:46] in your mind's eye view if I call wait
[37:49] on the phone he answer the phone you
[37:51] know now in modern science we got now
[37:54] here we look at each other we used to
[37:56] life about that about 40 years ago 50
[37:59] years ago you know you talk about that
[38:01] some of your older ones remember you
[38:03] remember what you said so you can't
[38:05] answer the phone you put your clothes on
[38:08] all right that's what we all liked about
[38:12] code it's true you see the people well
[38:18] what if I died Wade and Terence appeared
[38:22] on the screen not right it's not the
[38:29] person I want to talk to
[38:35] why don't you think about Jesus Christ
[38:38] as being real well he's just a spirit
[38:45] now we follow our prophets message I
[38:47] know the brother I know his face but I
[38:49] can't
[38:50] woman El Salvador we believe God sent a
[38:54] prophet to us in the last day and I got
[38:56] him laying here if anybody wants some
[38:57] see God is a being he's not just to say
[39:01] I spook from floating around that's the
[39:05] old Indian talking to the things huh I'm
[39:10] not going up on the old Indian because
[39:11] he remember them all Indians we're doing
[39:12] pretty good you know that Geronimo
[39:16] probably the reason they could never
[39:17] capture little boy Geronimo saw visions
[39:20] because he entered the spirit world see
[39:22] he could do those things my being as he
[39:25] words why they call him the shaman the
[39:28] guy they were what they called him for
[39:29] the Indian medicine man but listen he
[39:33] said what are you getting at I'm getting
[39:34] to one point when you're praying do you
[39:39] ever think about who you're praying to I
[39:46] mean really do your seriously ever think
[39:49] about who you're praying to but I just
[39:54] pray to the Father I pray this what I'm
[39:56] sorry I know problem but if these are
[40:01] being not like the wind remember
[40:06] probably explaining God is not even
[40:09] listen
[40:10] we called him omnipresent we try to make
[40:13] it do it you know that God is not
[40:15] omnipresent it's Excel for the fact that
[40:17] he's omniscient because he's a beating
[40:19] now wait a minute you're trying to limit
[40:22] in some I'm not limiting something I'm
[40:23] telling the truth
[40:24] God is a being you not like the wind is
[40:28] blowing about he wasn't that before the
[40:34] world ever begun he wasn't that before
[40:36] time ever begun I'm just some floating
[40:39] spirit if we get into all these movies
[40:43] and things and we try to think things
[40:45] out
[40:45] they do and they got these kind of
[40:48] something neat this here is supposed to
[40:49] be their sit no God is real he's real
[41:01] he's a person he's the only person he's
[41:07] not the first person to the second
[41:09] person or third person he's not nothing
[41:12] he is the person he's Almighty God
[41:15] himself made manifest in flesh is that
[41:18] what your scripture says God took upon
[41:23] form as we said we got to the baby
[41:26] talking about Jesus God took on a form
[41:31] of a human being and in soul that man we
[41:38] look at better that little baby we look
[41:40] at you remember we ended up the other
[41:41] day talking about Jehovah crying in the
[41:44] cradle it's over with no teeth
[41:48] Jehovah play in why can't you take that
[41:52] way it happened
[41:55] your whole is a car burger making a
[41:57] living why can't we think of it that way
[42:01] call this real they bring them the vorc
[42:04] real to you and not just some spirit
[42:10] that you well he has no form he's just
[42:14] floating around everywhere you think
[42:18] you're reeling it's like he's not real
[42:21] you mean this wood is more real or more
[42:28] tangible or what the words is for it
[42:31] then Almighty God who made the tree so
[42:39] what you don't believe God can just be a
[42:41] spirit and he can appear to you yeah you
[42:46] can talk to you can do but he's also
[42:48] real don't you try talking to him
[42:51] sometime
[42:53] why don't you think about your
[42:55] priorities a contact between you and
[42:57] Almighty God
[43:01] is he ever that real to you you ever
[43:08] felt his presence to work you knew that
[43:10] they were just a presence with you never
[43:13] done that
[43:14] that's wonderful didn't it it's
[43:16] marvelous but what if he walked right
[43:19] out in front of me
[43:26] you say you can't do it he's done it
[43:36] what about when brother brother saw
[43:37] Jesus out in the field of their
[43:39] Jefferson be standing up in there I like
[43:43] the way he says it
[43:46] he said Hoffman's head of Christ is the
[43:50] closest and he didn't say it look just
[43:51] like him
[43:52] listen what he said he said it's the
[43:54] closest of anything man has ever painted
[44:00] of Jesus Christ you know what he saw him
[44:06] he saw him you going to take his word
[44:11] for it that he saw him why not you take
[44:14] his word on everything else I can't you
[44:15] believe that but you see people who have
[44:20] never experienced supernatural things to
[44:23] know is hard for them to believe
[44:27] understand that you got one person that
[44:32] is seen times the other person has never
[44:35] seen it like that it's hard to get that
[44:37] person that hasn't seen it to understand
[44:39] what you saw but why can't you
[44:44] disbelieve simplicity that God is real
[44:51] do we talk about one true and living God
[44:54] but do we believe in one true and living
[44:55] God
[45:04] Jesus said if you see me recording
[45:11] Trisha he said you've seen my father he
[45:16] said because my father and I are one and
[45:23] he said if you same name you've seen the
[45:26] father
[45:27] well what's your father look like you
[45:34] know think my god what does the father
[45:37] looked like when on Jesus he was six
[45:41] foot tall and he was nestling and the
[45:44] father was a fat old ground food
[45:47] now that's not what he said he said if
[45:51] you've seen me he said you've seen the
[45:54] father he said why do you ask to see me
[45:57] said if you've seen me in seeing the
[45:59] father but his name is Jesus when he how
[46:11] trouble calling his name Jesus he said
[46:16] everything to ask he said everything you
[46:18] do in word and deed do all in the name
[46:25] of Jesus Christ but now listen I tried
[46:32] to state it I made it over and over and
[46:33] I want you to think cold fish I say
[46:35] Jesus your mind automatically Falls to a
[46:39] human flesh you said well when did Jesus
[46:46] coming to me it'll fall to a baby in a
[46:49] cradle to fall to human being as we call
[46:55] it flash you know I wonder what that man
[47:03] who throwed them three Hebrew children
[47:04] in that fiery furnace and he gets up the
[47:07] next morning he looks down in there and
[47:09] he said didn't we throw three and they
[47:11] said yeah he said war they forward I
[47:12] don't know and watch what he said he
[47:15] said in one of them is likened to the
[47:17] show
[47:17] of God then why would that heathen King
[47:21] say that because one thing for sure if
[47:27] there was something else in learned they
[47:29] wouldn't get burnt up
[47:30] it had to be God right alright and if it
[47:34] was God and he could see it he knew God
[47:36] had to change a form in some way to be
[47:41] able to him to see that he said like
[47:45] unto the Son of God his name is Jesus
[47:50] what about it then God has never had but
[47:57] one name his name is Jesus there's no
[48:03] salvation entitled now listen what I'm
[48:09] saying we you know we come from that at
[48:12] the point we saw where the Catholic
[48:14] Church and improve it you know that they
[48:16] changed the mood or way of baptism from
[48:19] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[48:21] father son Holy Ghost down about six Oh
[48:23] developed fully about six oh six started
[48:25] in 325 right and see they say and keep
[48:31] saying father son holy a lot lately and
[48:34] father son the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[48:40] is simply Lord Jesus Christ that's
[48:43] helpful in simple to us to understand
[48:46] but as the theologian about it you can't
[48:51] think that simple because really see
[48:53] it's got to be revealed to you
[48:56] now letters are the page
[48:59] riding a Jes us there's no revelation to
[49:03] just look at that that's natural human
[49:04] writing when you see who that really is
[49:12] and you know who you're talking to is
[49:14] like I said it a minute ago
[49:15] you call somebody on the phone and you
[49:18] know who you're talking to you know if
[49:20] you know the person in your mind's eye
[49:23] view you can see the person that you're
[49:26] talking to you see what in your mind's
[49:30] eye view not it
[49:31] ain't all mighty telephones now that get
[49:33] door you really see the whole person I'm
[49:35] talking about that you can see by your
[49:38] mind's eye view of who you're talking to
[49:43] and by seeing by your mind's eye view
[49:50] you see the actual person let's die like
[49:59] I said have you ever thought about it so
[50:01] much until that you could bring into
[50:05] mind a picture in your mind of what
[50:08] Jesus Christ looks like you know a lot
[50:12] of them doing that and read a lot of
[50:13] drawings they come out a whole lot and
[50:15] that stuff right
[50:17] you ever seen all the Alaniz hundreds of
[50:20] different drawings of Jesus we none of
[50:22] them fit the thing that brother branham
[50:24] said well I'm just dumb enough to state
[50:26] what he said if he saw Jesus and he
[50:28] looked like Hoffman's or not I like
[50:30] Hoffman's they're back here you know see
[50:36] people will say well why you got two
[50:38] pictures back there look at one of them
[50:40] is young look the other one is old my
[50:42] sins caused that problem so I'm in the
[50:46] middle and that's the reason those
[50:48] pictures had always been there I caused
[50:53] that Tim to look like he did when he got
[50:55] beat my sins Shirley why can't I believe
[51:01] him as being real yes but brother Dale
[51:07] he's never spoke to me if you ever heard
[51:08] him speak yeah but not in your words and
[51:12] Thompson speaking you ever heard him to
[51:18] just tell you something right
[51:27] yeah but see you're making it down that
[51:30] you're bringing him down to worry more
[51:32] tangible seemingly you're trying to make
[51:35] him more that we could move if he is to
[51:38] create or that created us is tangible
[51:42] then he's greater than us is being
[51:44] tangible why wouldn't we think of that
[51:47] when we consider that we know the truth
[51:53] what about the religious world that is
[51:56] in total darkness believe it in a
[51:58] trinity concept and today they're
[52:00] singing and worshipping and say Jesus
[52:04] Jesus we love you we'll go ask them
[52:09] about their doctrine of the Trinity and
[52:12] they'll let you know they don't leave it
[52:14] like that what's their minds I view what
[52:23] jesus looks like you understand what I'm
[52:27] saying why don't we look at it as a
[52:28] person why don't we look at God has a
[52:30] real being a person and then you can
[52:35] begin to visualize more and more that he
[52:37] can have a name that he's not just a
[52:41] spirit floating around that he's real
[52:49] why can't we just put it to that
[52:51] understanding that it's not
[52:53] understanding letters on a page it's
[52:56] understanding that name is that person
[53:03] is that true let me go down to commerce
[53:08] and you say Donnie faught Busch we got
[53:14] all these cells carved up on the other
[53:16] end of town he's kind of a tall guy a
[53:19] little crazy but he's all right you
[53:26] understand what I'm getting at they know
[53:28] him by his name what do you know God by
[53:31] his name
[53:39] instead of just said what I've got to
[53:41] call him Jesus Jesus Jesus
[53:43] I thought we believe that the Bride of
[53:53] Christ was to come into the adoption all
[53:56] stages in the life stage that she could
[53:59] speak in his name
[54:00] I thought we believed are in mark or it
[54:10] says you say to this mountain be moved
[54:13] and go down
[54:15] I thought we believed the Bible but do
[54:22] we believe in it being real and she
[54:27] talked to him like a real person you
[54:31] still remember the story reason I say
[54:33] that I don't make light of nobody I'm
[54:35] not doing nothing the brother Branham in
[54:37] his beginning you know he said he heard
[54:39] people say you pray this way you get
[54:41] down this way you go down that way you
[54:43] go this way he was trying to find some
[54:47] way to contact actress all over with he
[54:50] just hold it down and said Lord just
[54:53] listen to me you know we might change
[55:02] some of our thoughts of our mind if we
[55:06] realize God knows her my I cost more
[55:08] than our literal words that we say right
[55:15] but is your God real I've got about a
[55:18] real God because this is a background
[55:20] part for coming up the Lord willing into
[55:23] some talks we're going our way back
[55:25] again and pick up and come down but what
[55:32] about it
[55:36] why would have the Bible in Revelations
[55:39] three and one talked about in the fifth
[55:42] church age that thou has the name that
[55:44] you're livid but you're dead see they
[55:47] had lost the name of Jesus Christ
[55:52] that's the stove's of human mind now
[55:59] they never lost the name of Jesus to the
[56:02] Trinitarian people called him Jesus they
[56:06] never lost that what did they lose what
[56:10] was lost in the dark ages that the
[56:13] Prophet would call it and say his name
[56:14] was lost in the fifth church age but
[56:18] sitting in the six church age you see it
[56:20] coming back to his name and he said
[56:22] right in between the six church age in
[56:23] the seventh he said the name of Jesus
[56:25] you go back and check your history and
[56:27] between those two parts you got your
[56:30] oneness people coming back in right at
[56:32] the turn of the century and you got your
[56:34] Jesus only people that was a move of God
[56:37] for that day but we don't want to
[56:39] believe that that's just like believing
[56:41] the name of God in Jesus we don't want
[56:43] to believe that that Martin Luther and
[56:45] Lutheran Church started out with a man
[56:48] that was led of God and the whole world
[56:51] was waiting on Luther to proclaim the
[56:54] judge you live by faith and God took
[56:58] that invasive and converted the world we
[57:05] don't want to believe it can we looking
[57:07] back at them as Luther and they are not
[57:09] doing everything in the world I do at
[57:10] home
[57:10] what is that making it ever done any
[57:12] guys that started it where did you not
[57:16] come from but think about it
[57:21] this sign of good living point and we'll
[57:23] quit he's in that name of Jesus being
[57:27] restored the Bible calls it during
[57:30] revelation open door an open door
[57:36] between the six churches in the seventh
[57:38] there's a door open which was the
[57:42] revelation of his name now in the ages
[57:44] did they as I always emphasize it you
[57:47] know
[57:47] or try to
[57:49] you say the name was lost did they call
[57:52] him Jim Joe or Charlie no they called
[57:56] him Jesus but they lost the revelation
[58:00] of who he was and what he was and they
[58:04] called him the third person of the
[58:05] Trinity right they lost the revelation
[58:12] of supreme deity it didn't change the
[58:15] letters on the page they called him
[58:19] Jesus but mankind had so perverted it
[58:25] until a real true meaning of God in his
[58:29] church it went so far away until the
[58:34] Bible writes it up is saying we got to
[58:37] open the door because they've done
[58:40] forgot all about me the revelation of
[58:44] God supreme deity of who he was not
[58:50] access to regards see that was what was
[58:52] lost the word the word was lost through
[58:58] the ages and they wouldn't allow the
[59:01] people to read it they forbid mankind to
[59:05] read it and then write in Latin and
[59:07] speaking Latin honey only Tomic spoken
[59:11] English when it told you what you had to
[59:13] do no joke I screwed right they come
[59:17] down to tell you and you were confessing
[59:20] your problems they told you what to do
[59:21] the only time they spoke to him English
[59:25] rest of the time they wanted to keep it
[59:27] Latin because he didn't want you to know
[59:30] anything about God but I keep saying it
[59:35] you're gone renal or just a thoughts
[59:38] from your mind have you ever had an
[59:44] experience with God to where that you're
[59:46] not just saying mama said it daddy said
[59:49] it uncle said it ain't said it or
[59:51] whoever said it
[59:59] you ever just got down to the point of
[1:00:01] seeing him as being real then you'll see
[1:00:07] that it wasn't Jes us that was lost in
[1:00:10] the ages they still called him Jesus but
[1:00:14] they called him what they had been
[1:00:17] taught to call him the third person
[1:00:19] second person and that still be
[1:00:22] happening right today or is God real to
[1:00:27] you you called him on the phone you know
[1:00:31] what I'm talking about and you praying
[1:00:33] who you praying to are we praying to the
[1:00:39] Holy Ghost to get him to pray to the
[1:00:41] Father and to do it all in Jesus name or
[1:00:48] we prayed to Jesus himself which we know
[1:00:51] is to be an Almighty God
[1:00:56] what about it no salvation except in the
[1:01:02] name of Jesus Christ that name was so
[1:01:10] marvelous wonderful it takes all now
[1:01:15] listen set it over and over to you for
[1:01:18] three services it takes all of them
[1:01:21] titles any title you could come up with
[1:01:25] Rosa sure and Lily divided rotten
[1:01:27] Morningstar Alphin amigo
[1:01:29] I am Elohim Jehovah Yahweh's anything
[1:01:33] you wanna go it takes all that put
[1:01:35] together to be that one name Co Jesus
[1:01:43] and you agreed well ago when you'd say I
[1:01:46] come in my father's name and I come in
[1:01:48] my father's name so that would make all
[1:01:50] of us as being having one night all the
[1:01:54] children of God out of the same night
[1:01:58] what I call you cheating all see you're
[1:02:01] getting so carnal you're not even
[1:02:03] listening it's not to call you Jesus
[1:02:09] that's not what we're talking about
[1:02:11] out which is to know who we are you
[1:02:18] realize only a Christian has a right to
[1:02:20] call the name of Jesus the rest God
[1:02:24] permits that it allows it and honors it
[1:02:29] the only of Christian have the right to
[1:02:31] call his name because he's the only one
[1:02:34] that's really supposed to know is not
[1:02:39] and we're talking about Father's Day you
[1:02:42] remember as kids and you watch your
[1:02:47] father do things and you do a lot of
[1:02:49] that now I watch these kids around here
[1:02:54] and I see them and then I just like
[1:02:58] cause I look and I'll see them I see you
[1:03:02] walk a certain way and the way you do
[1:03:05] and look and see your children doing the
[1:03:10] same time we call it follow following
[1:03:13] into father's footprints you know that's
[1:03:17] good I thought we're supposed to follow
[1:03:22] into our real father's foot trench the
[1:03:25] one who saved us the one who gave his
[1:03:27] life for us now I'm bringing it down to
[1:03:32] a talk I'll jump a lot of the message
[1:03:33] would you get to this you believe enough
[1:03:38] in one true and living God to believe
[1:03:41] this statement listen to over the old is
[1:03:50] to Jesus or the new you really believe
[1:03:55] that what I told it you're holding
[1:03:57] witness one day I said I'm reward your
[1:03:59] holy witness and you all you are I see
[1:04:02] ever caught your holy the old Jesus or
[1:04:04] the new you just look at him
[1:04:08] the old man grabbed his arm took into
[1:04:11] the truck okay you want that boy to ask
[1:04:13] for more questions but do you really
[1:04:16] believe you're over the old
[1:04:17] it's Jesus at the end or did he change
[1:04:20] somewhere in between
[1:04:23] now let me ask you this way where you
[1:04:27] get my point
[1:04:28] most everybody texts you over the old
[1:04:30] was a mean old daddy
[1:04:32] you killed everybody for whatever they'd
[1:04:34] done and wrote Ten Commandments and all
[1:04:37] he wanted to do was he lined up and beat
[1:04:40] you to death to the old guys ride
[1:04:42] everybody says you're whole you know
[1:04:43] here there was no love that guy
[1:04:48] and where did you get that idea
[1:04:51] it ain't in the Bible you means you're
[1:04:58] over meaning like a father with his
[1:05:00] family in the Old Testament you're hobos
[1:05:03] we call him/her God was a God of hate
[1:05:07] Jesus is a God of
[1:05:19] you've got a lot of mercy and grace in
[1:05:22] the Old Testament the law itself is God
[1:05:29] in the letter form the Ten Commandments
[1:05:32] is God if you read it different you
[1:05:36] wouldn't read it nor so good pillow
[1:05:41] could read it from a different thing and
[1:05:43] say I shall not kill is it a god of
[1:05:54] hatred but yet in the human realm listen
[1:05:57] even your prophet said one day he said I
[1:06:01] used to think that God hated me but
[1:06:05] Jesus loved me he said until I found out
[1:06:08] they were the same person now how can he
[1:06:12] be a person of hatred or arrogant lean
[1:06:16] in the Old Testament and come into the
[1:06:18] new testament and turn the other cheek
[1:06:21] and be the God of love you're not in
[1:06:26] your Bible you can't believe it
[1:06:29] the way I'm talking about it when I
[1:06:31] saved you over the old is Jesus of the
[1:06:33] news nothing changed he just stepped
[1:06:42] into human flesh but do you really
[1:06:50] believe that that little baby that was
[1:06:52] laying in the cradle was Almighty God
[1:06:57] you really believe that I've had people
[1:07:01] say well who wrong the world while he
[1:07:03] was in the womb I said he just spoke it
[1:07:07] before he went to the womb that took
[1:07:08] care of it it'll run until it gets
[1:07:11] through but see that's we think you know
[1:07:15] what do you really believe well the
[1:07:20] Bible said God was in Christ reconciling
[1:07:21] the world unto himself Bible said in
[1:07:27] healing well the fullness of the Godhead
[1:07:29] bodily
[1:07:33] you mean when he walked her yes when he
[1:07:35] walked dark he was Father Son and Holy
[1:07:38] Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:07:42] he was all of them titles he was all of
[1:07:45] them Jehovah's and other hymns and
[1:07:47] fathers sons and Holy Ghost he would all
[1:07:50] of that his name was Jesus because
[1:07:55] energy over the old Jesus of the near
[1:07:56] let's turn it around the Jesus of the
[1:07:59] old is still a Jehovah today because you
[1:08:04] know what you over me father with his
[1:08:05] family he never lost any title I've
[1:08:08] always tried to get you to look at one
[1:08:10] time you go back before the world this
[1:08:12] is what always helped me you go back
[1:08:14] before the world and you see you talk
[1:08:18] about him having attributes and he never
[1:08:21] gained one attribute coming into the
[1:08:24] world and displayed his attributes
[1:08:27] he had his attributes for the world well
[1:08:33] why can't we see it now he never done
[1:08:37] away with Jehovah he's still a father
[1:08:40] with his family he never done away with
[1:08:42] Elohim that means self-existing because
[1:08:45] he still the self existing God who
[1:08:47] exists in his people but how about
[1:08:51] you're probably saying it like this
[1:08:54] he said that Godhead is not complete
[1:08:58] without you do you really believe that
[1:09:10] you really believe it is that Godhead is
[1:09:14] not complete without you come on why
[1:09:17] don't you think about what is the
[1:09:19] Godhead father son holy go son where are
[1:09:27] the sons and daughters of the Living God
[1:09:31] but he's not complete without being you
[1:09:37] what do you really see that you all the
[1:09:39] old in Jesus within you
[1:09:43] you know what the Apostle Paul and allow
[1:09:46] time to read them like I'm laying here
[1:09:48] you know the Apostle Paul was the only
[1:09:51] one of the Apostles it knew that I'm
[1:10:01] quoting brother Brandon all sinned
[1:10:08] because of the abundance of Revelation
[1:10:11] LeBron said Paul had more revelation in
[1:10:15] here the rest of them said because he
[1:10:17] had the revelation to holy o the
[1:10:19] cheese's of the new the Apostle Paul had
[1:10:25] a deeper revelation than any of the
[1:10:28] Apostles now here's my ending point
[1:10:31] gotta try to make it if Paul understood
[1:10:36] that you over the old was Jesus of the
[1:10:39] new I've got three I think it is laying
[1:10:43] there whoops
[1:10:47] then what if Peter believed
[1:10:56] what did John what it Matthew what did
[1:11:03] they believe you know what they believe
[1:11:08] now listen
[1:11:10] they believe is your over the old with
[1:11:12] Jesus is the new well you just said they
[1:11:16] didn't didn't lay that no they believed
[1:11:19] it in the lower understanding their
[1:11:23] understanding of God was one crew and
[1:11:26] living God right repeater in his riding
[1:11:30] and see he's not a Trinitarian he
[1:11:34] believed in one true and living God look
[1:11:37] at John and all of them all just had a
[1:11:41] deeper revelation that would bring down
[1:11:45] to the end time Paul believed in the
[1:11:52] supreme deity john believed in the
[1:11:55] supreme deity Peter believed in the
[1:11:57] supreme deity with their revelation was
[1:12:00] just not the depth of the Apostle Paul
[1:12:06] come on explain it some other way -
[1:12:11] Peter didn't believe in another god or
[1:12:15] didn't believe Jesus was a second person
[1:12:17] or something like that he believed that
[1:12:19] that was the same Almighty God that was
[1:12:22] in the Old Testament but he just didn't
[1:12:26] believe it is the depth the Apostle Paul
[1:12:32] you know why you believe the prophet saw
[1:12:43] Jesus standing in the field of burned
[1:12:45] Jefferson did not you believe that he
[1:12:51] said he did it what did Paul see on the
[1:12:57] road at Damascus
[1:13:02] what did Paul said now don't go to
[1:13:06] carnal women he didn't have to see him
[1:13:10] standing there to look like Hoffman over
[1:13:16] here that run around him which all here
[1:13:18] don't make me carnal he saw Jesus go to
[1:13:26] random What did he say about it no
[1:13:28] wonder he'd make it he said there was no
[1:13:30] way that Jim was going to call that
[1:13:35] pillar of fire Lord he saw him from his
[1:13:44] mind's eye view maybe not a
[1:13:45] hoffman's of a picture that run around
[1:13:48] it was all Jesus I don't have to go
[1:13:52] anyway he saw him from his mind's eye
[1:13:54] view and it was so confusing actually
[1:14:03] these other guys are talking about
[1:14:05] spiritual binge remember he what I will
[1:14:09] say just a little bit me left is it
[1:14:12] they're not talking about the acid yeah
[1:14:15] I don't say what I saw something real
[1:14:23] but that's why I called him Lord you
[1:14:26] know he called him Lord where he got an
[1:14:28] uber Oh
[1:14:33] so Jesus he's so so real
[1:14:43] he believes that you over the old but
[1:14:46] Jesus isn't it Peter never saw him my
[1:14:50] revelation i along saw him a revelation
[1:14:53] that's what I'm getting at asking you
[1:14:56] and I'm the question have you ever seen
[1:14:59] God by revelation and you never see God
[1:15:07] by revelation in his word they'll never
[1:15:12] talk you out it
[1:15:15] right sorry folks
[1:15:18] what about all the people of this
[1:15:20] message that is left yet they preached
[1:15:28] Jesus for forty fifty years they never
[1:15:36] saw Jesus they never saw Jesus like
[1:15:39] Peter saw Peter showing this Almighty
[1:15:49] God Paul saw him as a total supreme
[1:15:53] almighty deity that would tie in and
[1:15:58] come all the way to this day and the
[1:16:03] endtime revelation is that you hold the
[1:16:06] older Jesus or the new with the same
[1:16:08] revelation Paul and you know that
[1:16:14] come on musician you see him as who he
[1:16:17] is then you'll see his name is Jesus
[1:16:21] you'll see him and know that his name is
[1:16:25] Jesus then you can talk to him not don't
[1:16:33] out you don't have to get down and
[1:16:35] practice your wording to contact God now
[1:16:41] let me say this and that's plain
[1:16:43] language do you know what communion
[1:16:47] means to communicate but you know really
[1:16:53] what it is you shut your mouth and you
[1:16:56] listen to God prior is that not there we
[1:17:03] think priors all of these great words we
[1:17:05] pour out and we have to tell him out of
[1:17:07] a prop you ever explained to God what
[1:17:09] the trouble was now be sensible you know
[1:17:13] it's true you said Lord you know so I
[1:17:15] told it so in the end I've done and I
[1:17:17] done this Lord I don't know he knows
[1:17:20] more about it you do yes you're trying
[1:17:23] to explain it to him
[1:17:26] don't you sometimes set out you hardly
[1:17:30] said I get up and wonderful two knots up
[1:17:35] in the mountains I never got out of the
[1:17:38] bed from 10:30 to 7:15 wonderful rest
[1:17:46] and that's not one time had to get up
[1:17:48] that's not out of about six times you
[1:17:55] know what up right and I asked God they
[1:17:58] take care of you know what I do a lot of
[1:18:01] time I just go in there and settle him I
[1:18:07] just sat down once the Lord you know the
[1:18:14] troubles you know the problem you know
[1:18:17] every time just take care of it
[1:18:19] now you got anything you wanna say to me
[1:18:21] you know what he might talk to you want
[1:18:27] to do that but just don't get scared if
[1:18:30] he does you ask him to he might start
[1:18:35] talking to me the communication we think
[1:18:39] is blabbermouth and we're oozing all the
[1:18:42] words communication is shut your mouth
[1:18:44] and the lips from the garlic there is a
