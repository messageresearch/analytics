[6:19] will sacrifice unto thee with the voice
[6:21] of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I
[6:24] have vowed salvation is of the Lord
[6:31] seasons 1 verse 4 according has he has
[6:35] chosen us in him before the foundation
[6:37] of the world that we should be holding
[6:40] without blame before him and love having
[6:43] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[6:45] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[6:47] according to the good pleasure of his
[6:49] will to the praise of the glory of His
[6:52] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[6:54] in the beloved in whom we have
[6:57] redemption through his blood the
[6:58] forgiveness of sins according to the
[7:01] riches of His grace wherein he had to
[7:04] bounded toward us in all wisdom and
[7:06] prudence having made known unto us the
[7:09] mystery of his will according to his
[7:11] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[7:13] himself that in the dispensation of the
[7:16] fullness of times you might gather
[7:18] together in one all things in Christ
[7:20] both which are in heaven in which our
[7:23] own earth even in him in whom also we
[7:26] have obtained an inheritance being
[7:29] predestinated according to the purpose
[7:31] of him who worketh all things after the
[7:34] counsel of his own will that we should
[7:37] be to the praise of his glory who first
[7:40] trusted in Christ in whom in whom ye
[7:44] also trusted after that you heard the
[7:47] word of truth now remember after you
[7:50] hear the truth they took that on over
[7:55] into acts and all
[7:56] weathers right all the Scriptures
[7:58] alright after that you have heard the
[8:02] word of truth the gospel of your
[8:03] salvation
[8:04] now what's their title so we've spent 10
[8:08] 12 15 20 messages on salvation now we're
[8:12] on what from salvation to Redemption
[8:16] alright so what's he saying if you heard
[8:19] the word of truth the gospel of your
[8:21] salvation and whom I also after that you
[8:24] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[8:27] Spirit of promise now what is that Holy
[8:29] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[8:31] of our inheritance until the redemption
[8:34] of the purchased possession under the
[8:36] praise of his glory amen you may be
[8:38] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[8:41] reading of the word alright now say in
[8:47] our title is showing what we're talking
[8:49] about we're talking about now coming
[8:53] from salvation all the Old Testament is
[8:56] a background everything sitting in the
[8:59] Old Testament in that line as a
[9:00] background all right coming into the New
[9:03] Testament coming into Redemption alright
[9:08] because that's dealing with it the Old
[9:10] Testament had no new birth they did not
[9:15] have eternal life in their soul in the
[9:18] Old Testament we've been through John
[9:20] and and Adam so alright we've covered
[9:23] that okay yeah but then coming to a
[9:27] point of redemption and coming to the
[9:31] place that Jesus Christ prayed to price
[9:34] that we could be redeemed
[9:37] alright then this Redemption we're
[9:40] reading on over that it even goes to
[9:42] that what the what you receive as the
[9:45] new birth as being just an earnest of
[9:49] your full Redemption which will be the
[9:54] redeeming of these bodies ohright to
[9:56] take us in a rapture and then you'll see
[10:00] and then you can truly say at that point
[10:03] I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:06] because that'll be finished it will all
[10:09] be done
[10:09] won't be anything and it'll be laid in
[10:12] that order the Prophet said on
[10:15] blasphemous names he said that the
[10:18] baptism has been taught of the Holy
[10:22] Spirit but he said it's been taught
[10:23] incorrectly all right now what does it
[10:27] mean to teach something incorrectly it
[10:31] means you just you can totally go the
[10:33] opposite direction
[10:34] are you conducing but all you got to do
[10:37] is slide a little idea or a thought into
[10:41] something and it'll change it from what
[10:44] you are trying to say all right as an
[10:48] example listen to these statements today
[10:52] and then I'll repeat them Sunday and
[10:54] whenever I preach them over and over and
[10:56] over I'll keep repeating them caught a
[10:58] one held in your mind you remember they
[11:01] thought we were carrying Sunday that the
[11:04] Bible in the writing of the Bible it's
[11:10] written to her yes it can be it has
[11:13] compound meaning compound revelation all
[11:17] right but remember it cannot have
[11:23] contrary revelations all right it can be
[11:29] you know compound meaning two meanings
[11:32] or something to pick up a natural or a
[11:34] spiritual but it cannot have that the
[11:37] Bible can't be telling you of Jesus
[11:40] Christ and then some great revelation of
[11:44] the devil you know or Satan because that
[11:49] would not be correct the Bible is a
[11:50] revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet
[11:54] said if you don't see Christ in ever
[11:55] verse he didn't say if you didn't see
[11:57] Christ in 1 the devil in another one and
[11:59] all this other sure the opening of the
[12:03] word exposes the devil but remember the
[12:07] opening of the word is the revelation of
[12:09] Jesus Christ
[12:10] so what's going to expose the devil the
[12:13] revelation of Jesus Christ all right so
[12:15] now we'll keep saying that until we get
[12:18] the thought in our mind but remember the
[12:21] Bible is written then straight across
[12:25] now watch what I'm saying now the Bible
[12:29] is written straight across thank God
[12:32] that he sent us a prophet because that
[12:36] prophet can come down underneath maybe
[12:39] is not a good way of saying it but best
[12:42] I got it can come down into the word and
[12:45] he can show you the things you know that
[12:49] we knew some of it because it was
[12:52] written in the word like I'll bring my
[12:54] son out of Egypt and then Jesus Christ
[12:57] that's that's fine but the rest of the
[13:00] word see it comes to the Prophet when he
[13:04] says this is what that is the word he
[13:09] means if there's any way of going down
[13:13] he's starting at the earnest and the way
[13:17] I always preached it's always been that
[13:18] way if you ever noticed it when I start
[13:20] a topic I go to the I don't know what
[13:23] you call it bottom or the lowest I go
[13:25] down to where you start the earnest or
[13:27] something most everybody jumps up here
[13:29] to the headstone of it and or the top of
[13:32] it and goes with that you know no I have
[13:34] to start at the bottom and come up
[13:36] because that way I know I've got an
[13:39] anchor that once I reach the apex of
[13:42] what I'm talking about that I don't
[13:45] worry about what somebody says because
[13:47] I've already covered that come on so
[13:49] what about well we'll go back to message
[13:51] number three eight nine ten messages ago
[13:53] and you'll hear that I explained that
[13:55] see that way I can can bring out that
[13:59] point and how that thought but remember
[14:04] then the Prophet the Bible is written it
[14:11] wasn't written over there words talking
[14:14] about Jesus coming and then turned
[14:17] around and wrote behind that and talked
[14:21] about well one of these is Jesus and the
[14:23] other one is Israel now that was back
[14:27] over in the word that was down into the
[14:30] parts of the word that was not to the
[14:34] top echelon the top
[14:36] Salon is Jesus Christ are you with me
[14:40] I mean that's the way I've always
[14:42] studied the Bible and that way then you
[14:44] don't get confused then you say what is
[14:47] love well you got to get so much love
[14:51] down here when you get the Newburgh you
[14:53] get so much love but that's an earnest
[14:58] compared to the love that comes forth
[15:01] all right so the Bible is written at the
[15:03] top all right now here's what we're
[15:05] saying so in the Bible that makes it
[15:09] confusing to mankind because in the
[15:12] stature of a perfect man in Peter by the
[15:15] Prophet explaining it you can start at
[15:17] faith and how the new birth all right
[15:21] then you can grow in grace and knowledge
[15:25] up the stature of a perfect man and come
[15:28] out to where it says Holy Spirit which
[15:31] would be the faith of the father's
[15:32] because that's what they had and then it
[15:35] goes on to the apex of the headstone
[15:38] which is the completion of the baptism
[15:40] of the Holy Spirit if you study the
[15:43] Bible that was very simple it brings
[15:47] everything to an opening that then you
[15:49] can read the Bible and see well this
[15:52] year we're speaking of that the Old
[15:55] Testament is one Thompson shatters
[15:58] speaking of bringing my son out of Egypt
[16:01] in the natural we're speaking of the
[16:06] apex of the finished product of Jesus
[16:09] Christ's coming if you study the Bible
[16:12] from that it'll line up beautiful and
[16:15] then you won't be confused you remember
[16:19] what we were bringing out the other day
[16:21] now just trying to get this point
[16:22] because I know lately of what I'm doing
[16:25] this driving drop points huh I want to
[16:27] get this to you you remember how we were
[16:29] bringing out the last message we went
[16:32] from the future home where brother
[16:34] Branham said that he had always taught
[16:37] those three stages of grace he said from
[16:42] the beginning as a boy well brother Dale
[16:46] I can show you where he taught us over
[16:48] here and he talked this over here and
[16:50] like he talked us know you just use the
[16:52] word that I'm glad you you it looks like
[16:54] he see you you've got Kotler see when
[16:58] you say it looks like this is his son he
[17:00] looks like that it's I know in the Bible
[17:03] that no look like that that's what I
[17:06] just got through saying it ain't look
[17:08] like that me or what the Prophet say
[17:12] about it you know it can't be no
[17:16] different
[17:16] okay now listen to the point I'm trying
[17:19] to get to to give you an illustration
[17:30] because we're going to need this value
[17:33] value it would be very valuable when we
[17:36] continue a few more messages all right
[17:38] now to show you how that we're going to
[17:42] have to listen to the Prophet and let
[17:46] him explain all right now he believed in
[17:52] his early part of his ministry and
[17:55] coming up he believed the evidence that
[18:01] he he came down to finally a point he
[18:04] believed in the gifts he believed in all
[18:06] of the things he said you can't do away
[18:08] with the the you know the the love the
[18:11] joy the peace the goodness and thing he
[18:13] would have that is an evidence then he
[18:16] would have he never did take tongs as
[18:19] evidenced but he did say you can speak
[18:21] in tongues while you haven't it come
[18:23] forth right he didn't annihilate it he
[18:27] just put it in the right order
[18:28] alright so in his evidence he would
[18:32] start down here now listen what I'm
[18:36] saying he would start at a lower earnest
[18:41] to understanding of the gifts the thing
[18:45] and then he finalized it by coming up to
[18:47] saying what now you need these weakens
[18:50] get him in a hurry he finally he come up
[18:52] and he said well brother and I were
[18:54] talking and said we we settled on the
[18:57] point of saying that it was love do you
[19:00] remember that huh
[19:04] you know that's true it is love
[19:11] now get what I'm saying he said on the
[19:14] future home that he taught the three
[19:17] processes what justification
[19:19] sanctification and the baptism of the
[19:21] Holy Ghost and he said he never changed
[19:26] I'm just illustrating the way that he
[19:29] went through things that looks like he
[19:31] changed but yet he didn't change he
[19:36] groped in development all right so he
[19:40] would start out as the gifts of saying
[19:41] well okay it's it's you know love joy
[19:45] peace goodness and time and that's true
[19:47] that still it's true then he would come
[19:51] up to a position of saying well okay
[19:54] we'll settle at this by saying it's love
[19:56] well you know it's true that's true
[20:01] all right but then he finally want the
[20:05] Holy Ghost are the angel of the Lord
[20:07] straightened him out on that he said and
[20:09] said it has to do with receiving the
[20:13] word you remember that all right now did
[20:17] that change him to work that he needed
[20:19] to go back and preach well I was wrong
[20:24] here I said it was love I was wrong here
[20:26] when I said it was the fruit of the
[20:27] Spirit I was wrong here and said did you
[20:29] have to go back and preach that why
[20:34] because those things were right it is
[20:40] the fruits of the spirit it is love with
[20:45] the fine Alice is a capstone head part
[20:47] of it comes out it to be what the
[20:51] opening of the word right whether or not
[20:55] the spirit and you can agree with the
[20:57] word all right don't forget this I'll
[20:59] repeat it don't forget it but I'll
[21:01] repeat it don't worry about it I won't
[21:03] let you forget it
[21:04] okay what about in his years now that
[21:10] we've just finished the series just
[21:12] recently that we went through months and
[21:15] months and months and and all talking of
[21:17] about we're brother branham in his early
[21:20] ministry basically now not every time
[21:23] basically the basics of his early
[21:26] ministry was what that man was a triune
[21:29] being but he would bring him body soul
[21:34] and spirit that's the basics now I
[21:41] didn't say all the time
[21:42] I said basics that's where he described
[21:46] it no we can give you that we've been
[21:48] over it we can give it to you where he
[21:50] brains it as the triune being of a man
[21:53] being body soul and spirit but then when
[22:00] he strikes along right in the 63-64
[22:03] especially and drops into 65 after the
[22:06] opening of the seals there in 63 what
[22:09] does he say he said he's a tri own big
[22:11] he said he's body spirit and soul right
[22:19] but he never preached a message at least
[22:23] I've never seen it or what ever heard it
[22:25] he never preached a message saying I was
[22:28] wrong back there I was wrong when I was
[22:31] saying body soul and spirit and putting
[22:36] a sinner real as the spirit see when he
[22:42] finally finishing it up he put the soul
[22:44] as a sin around and i preached that over
[22:46] to you for 40 years what then he didn't
[22:50] have to straighten nothing out because
[22:52] that was right because the soul is the
[22:54] nature of the Spirit and the Spirit is
[22:56] the nature of the soul so it's
[22:58] interchangeable to be able to be used
[23:00] and mankind through brother branham
[23:03] coming down you know you didn't don't
[23:05] have to check all this out but you can
[23:07] if you want to but a lot of it wound up
[23:10] being called solis doctrine and it wound
[23:13] up being that man did not have a soul
[23:16] until the law came into being that was
[23:18] the denominational doctrine and see then
[23:22] that soul they didn't make it to real
[23:26] thing okay
[23:29] are
[23:30] you following the net so brother branham
[23:32] could come in to his ministry and as he
[23:35] progressed and the opening of the word
[23:38] he would grow from the evidence and the
[23:40] Holy Ghost being love joy peace good up
[23:44] to love and other thing and then
[23:46] finalize it by making the apex of all of
[23:50] it as to whether or not the spirit in
[23:54] you agrees with the word all right so he
[23:57] would be on the soul in the spirit and
[23:59] interchangeable up and down through the
[24:02] early ministry coming on up then he
[24:05] comes into the sixty three four or five
[24:07] specially about four and five because
[24:12] the Bible says that Hebrews 4:12 the
[24:17] word is sharper than a two-edged sword
[24:18] dividing the soul and spirit
[24:20] join the Mara so it took the opening of
[24:22] the seals to bring the prophet to the
[24:24] revelation to finalize it as an apex
[24:29] that her own being is a body spirit and
[24:34] soul baba he could preach the anointed
[24:40] ones now come on we're in the message
[24:46] right the anointed ones are anointed
[24:49] were what did your prophet say they were
[24:53] anointed but on their spirit now what if
[24:57] he had to preach that message in his
[25:00] early ministry when he was saying the
[25:03] spirit was the inner realm of you
[25:10] okay I'm not trying to correct I'm
[25:14] trying to show you that he said it he
[25:16] done it and see then you'll see this
[25:21] when you get into it that he taught the
[25:24] three stages of grace justification same
[25:27] case the baptism I'll go all the way
[25:29] through his whole ministry right now
[25:37] we're in this part so I want to do it I
[25:40] had left off the brothers we laughed
[25:43] about it Kota when I came today brother
[25:46] Joe came in and he said we starting on
[25:48] number four he said I thought maybe I
[25:52] missed it
[25:53] if you look on your notes you got number
[25:55] four words the first one and I said well
[25:58] see I had moved some things around and
[26:01] put reposition and thing no way they're
[26:03] not handing them a piece of paper I said
[26:05] here's wine yours one two three because
[26:09] I got it after coming here as to bring
[26:12] it together and put it in order now
[26:14] listen what about your prophet teaching
[26:20] justification of saint christian -
[26:22] baptism of the holy ghost and that
[26:24] teaching it as the new birth yet they
[26:29] seems to be a lot of quotes in his early
[26:31] ministry that looked like argues to the
[26:35] point of what he's saying but remember
[26:38] he said he taught it from the beginning
[26:41] so that means we're misunderstanding
[26:44] when he say it is that right now we're
[26:48] misunderstanding because he said he told
[26:50] it that don't matter even if he says it
[26:54] exactly the way that it looks like it
[26:57] said to be wrong if he taught it from
[27:02] the beginning and didn't change
[27:04] something happened our understanding all
[27:08] right so now watch what I'm getting at
[27:13] I want to read three things in it and
[27:16] they can pull up and I think I gave them
[27:18] the wrong one on one of them but listen
[27:20] what about brother Branham always
[27:23] teaching three stages to the birth what
[27:26] about him always teaching the new birth
[27:29] the born to gain experience and the
[27:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost as the one in
[27:36] the same I know you automatically I know
[27:39] out there you automatically your mind is
[27:42] gonna run yeah but I got a quote here I
[27:44] got a quote diagon quote then you're
[27:46] saying he's wrong in the future all okay
[27:52] you're saying he's wrong
[27:55] now does that make you greater than him
[27:58] then we need to follow you that's no
[28:01] sarcastic that's just truth but listen
[28:05] what if I can read three things to
[28:09] before the opening of the word in the
[28:13] seals in one after and show you that
[28:18] he's taught the same thing all the way
[28:20] then whatever you pick up the old
[28:22] ministries in it everything you got to
[28:25] remember it's gonna have to have a place
[28:27] to line up now I've trying to tell you
[28:32] what I've said it and I mean it
[28:34] seriously this is the hardest message
[28:37] I've ever tried to preach it's the most
[28:39] bearing up on me mentally because I know
[28:43] in the next message or two I'm gonna
[28:46] have to say things that seems to be
[28:49] totally incorrect I can read you a quote
[28:58] that goes this way and read you a quote
[28:59] he goes that way but remember I don't
[29:04] care if that goes that way and that'n
[29:06] goes that away the apex of the entire
[29:10] message is what three works of grace are
[29:13] three stages not three works it's three
[29:15] stages of grace all right justification
[29:21] the same case in the baptismal holy God
[29:24] so then the baptism of the holy ghost is
[29:26] gonna have to be to word that we can
[29:29] follow it all the way through the
[29:31] message so in nineteen and fifty seven I
[29:34] hope we got these right I can we can
[29:37] swap over though pull-up number one
[29:39] which would be 1957 I hope I gave it to
[29:41] you in the right order which is a
[29:43] message called life they've brought a
[29:46] random priest 1957 602 so keeping the
[29:50] dates in your mind in a paragraph and if
[29:54] it's not there then I'll give them the
[29:55] other one but II 42 all right 1957
[30:02] joining church won't do it no sir that's
[30:05] the only perverting the real cause you
[30:12] mean he didn't want search membership
[30:14] oh come on if the devil can't get you
[30:19] out on those things he will take you to
[30:23] this other all right so don't settle for
[30:27] nothing less than an old-fashioned
[30:31] experience of the new birth to be born
[30:37] again of the spirit of the eternal God
[30:42] when your soul and God locks together
[30:45] and you become one so that's what is it
[30:50] new birth born again experience the
[30:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost are the spirit
[31:01] he puts them all in one paragraph what
[31:06] about that was 1957 now remember he
[31:10] can't change his doctrine okay I don't
[31:15] know where this will come up to the
[31:16] right one or not brother but it on 60
[31:19] let C be hearing recognizing acting on
[31:23] the Word of God Jeffersonville Indiana
[31:24] and I don't know if that one comes up
[31:27] and not will try to fit it in I gave
[31:29] them three and I gave them one extra one
[31:32] that's me my problem but listen 19 and
[31:36] 60
[31:38] 2:21 hearing recognizing acting on the
[31:41] Word of God now everyone knows that the
[31:46] seal of God is the birthright the
[31:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30
[31:55] saying grieve not the Spirit of God were
[31:58] by your seal till the day of your
[32:00] redemption when they were born again
[32:05] they were filled with the Holy Spirit
[32:08] the Holy Spirit is the new birth you
[32:13] know that you begat another spirit you
[32:16] admit it okay what are you getting new
[32:22] birth born again experience baptism of
[32:25] the Holy Ghost all in the same paragraph
[32:28] okay okay let's go over to God's
[32:34] provided way but surely they have this
[32:35] one number three priests in Bakersfield
[32:39] California 19 in 64 okay that's why man
[32:44] out to be today now he heard it in by
[32:47] some denominational coupe but come in
[32:50] the way God said come in by the baptism
[32:54] of the Holy Ghost and the new earth
[32:56] swarming warm swarming revival not
[33:01] Church joining solicited from door to
[33:03] door and passed out magazines but a
[33:06] birth being born again filled with the
[33:09] Holy Ghost God's Way freeing himself
[33:14] from the world all right there's a 57 19
[33:20] and 60 and a 64 okay it all gives the
[33:29] new birth the born-again experience and
[33:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one in
[33:33] the sign now
[33:41] this is the apex this is the finality
[33:44] this is the future home the city taught
[33:48] three processes justification of
[33:52] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[33:54] ghost you say yeah but now you're yeah
[33:56] I'm using exactly right
[33:58] the new birth the baptism with the Holy
[34:02] Ghost and the born-again experience are
[34:05] one in the sign and we're going to read
[34:11] where the prophet said it can't be no
[34:12] other way we're going to read where he
[34:14] said this stuff says and Lord okay but
[34:20] then we're going to have to drop back
[34:21] and we're gonna pick up some statements
[34:23] that are going to sound like that you
[34:26] know what I'm going to read what he says
[34:28] cuz that way you can't argue with me if
[34:31] I read what he say it okay that's kind
[34:33] of like that brother that they got onto
[34:35] him back a few years ago because of
[34:38] using like a word colored or something
[34:41] like that well then he proved the point
[34:43] was that he was reading what brother
[34:44] Branham said it wouldn't him making the
[34:48] statement out over the internet you know
[34:49] of saying colored or black or whatever
[34:52] we'll see they couldn't argue the point
[34:54] because here's a man back in the 50s
[34:55] that is reading from in the 50s it was
[34:59] colored you see you get the point
[35:02] alright now my point tonight is for one
[35:05] time the scriptures is written in a way
[35:12] that it has a total apex of entirety and
[35:16] that's what it's saying now listen I
[35:22] want you to raise your hand if you think
[35:25] you can find it good I'd like to read it
[35:28] you know to see well I'd like for you to
[35:34] think about a situation that is it
[35:41] anywhere in the Bible
[35:45] anywhere in the scripture in the
[35:47] prophets message that the Prophet would
[35:50] ever give an altar call and say I want
[35:53] you to come up here to get justified are
[36:01] you listening a lot of people came up
[36:03] and got that but I think the point the
[36:05] point is the the the altar call we've
[36:08] read from the Prophet will reread it
[36:09] tonight he said he gave an altar call
[36:12] for people to come and receive the
[36:15] baptism of the holy spirit which was
[36:16] exactly like Pentecost he said but they
[36:19] thought that it already had this or that
[36:24] or the other but show me any Scripture
[36:29] in the Bible even the thoughts on that
[36:32] scripture that would rate relate to the
[36:35] point that Peter or any of them ever
[36:40] gave an of altar call to come and repent
[36:45] or to come to be justified sanctified in
[36:49] anything you know no it was always to
[36:55] come and receive the baptism of the Holy
[36:58] Ghost the new birth or the born-again
[37:03] experience you know one of those can be
[37:07] in the scripture here another one in
[37:08] scripture there whatever but get what
[37:10] I'm saying but around them never made a
[37:14] altar call I want y'all to come up here
[37:17] and get justified yet we know a lot did
[37:24] nothing gonna do with it I'm saying what
[37:27] he's saying he's going the apex the
[37:30] height he said come and receive the
[37:33] baptism of the holy spirit now watch him
[37:37] right here's where he's talking about
[37:39] the baptism of the Holy Spirit at faith
[37:44] no the baptism of the Holy Ghost the day
[37:49] of Pentecost is what we're going to be
[37:51] dealing with
[37:51] we're not going to be dealing with the
[37:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the
[37:54] headstone or thoughts race that out
[37:58] it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[38:01] faith of the fathers that will be the
[38:03] next parts and thoughts in our mind all
[38:06] right so you fathered me that you want
[38:09] me to repeat it again there's no word
[38:11] that you'd find an altar call by the
[38:15] Prophet and I've never done it myself
[38:18] all right now I want y'all to come down
[38:21] here and I want y'all to just to repent
[38:23] I don't say that would you if you were
[38:28] up here I'd ask you to come and receive
[38:31] the baptism in the Holy College it may
[38:34] be all you get is repentance but that's
[38:38] your choice
[38:39] they were never an altar call in the
[38:41] Bible the Apostles or whatever we're
[38:44] gonna read what your prophet said let's
[38:46] see if it's wrong you see that's why
[38:51] it's so hard to preach the truth because
[38:56] so many people have already in their
[38:58] mind so many and I don't agree with the
[39:01] brother told brother mote years ago then
[39:03] brother motive said something to me one
[39:05] day and I won't call the others names
[39:06] but he had said something about getting
[39:11] the people to stay he said you get them
[39:13] people reading it in books and they'll
[39:15] know more about it and you do I want you
[39:21] to know more about it and I did I want
[39:25] you to read more than I did I want you
[39:27] to study more than I did because then
[39:29] there's one thing for sure when I make
[39:31] the statement brother Branham made you
[39:33] will know the statement is right and I
[39:38] don't have to explain then the statement
[39:42] because you'll know it I love to preach
[39:45] to people that are well-read
[39:49] yet I admit that it's easier to preach
[39:53] to people who know nothing to go to
[39:58] Africa right today and stand up and
[40:00] preach to a congregation of Baptists
[40:03] Methodists or whatever they were would
[40:06] be easier than try to preacher tonight
[40:08] it would be nothing is tiring upon the
[40:11] body to try to remember and try to say
[40:14] things in their own way and church has
[40:17] burdened me hard I said something to my
[40:19] wife the other day and I apologized to
[40:21] her about it I don't make excuses but I
[40:28] just do make it the truth I've never
[40:32] been one that was nervous
[40:35] whatever but if we don't get out of here
[40:40] pretty quick folks we're in bad shape
[40:44] one way or the other right because we're
[40:49] getting older well if I hurt your
[40:54] feelings or say something in some way
[40:56] that offends you or something I'm sorry
[40:59] but I'm trying my best to tell the truth
[41:02] I know it's made me is I'm just like
[41:06] that I know it because it's just you
[41:12] know that we ain't got time to play
[41:15] around now let me say it to you in the
[41:18] right way many of you have said over the
[41:21] years to me brother Dale we need to be
[41:23] we need preaching about the new birth we
[41:27] need to preaching about salvation and
[41:30] yet you go out into these things what
[41:37] I'm trying to preach salvation this
[41:38] simple this can be now you want me to go
[41:41] out on something else because I'm
[41:43] burdensome to you and telling the truth
[41:45] about it
[41:48] well I'm sorry that's just me okay now
[41:53] think about this the Prophet said that
[41:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not
[42:01] correctly called he said people say
[42:03] I believe the baptism he said he said
[42:07] that's like a car and things like that
[42:09] he said they spark plugs points in time
[42:11] he said but when you talk about the
[42:12] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot
[42:18] he said goes with it so you go to a
[42:23] Pentecostal church tonight and you say
[42:24] oh do you believe in the baptism of the
[42:27] Holy Spirit amen
[42:29] you want to walk right over here to the
[42:31] badness I'm not throwing no stones I'm
[42:34] talking you want to walk to a Baptist
[42:36] Church Methodist Church whatever and say
[42:39] do you believe in the baptism of the
[42:40] Holy Ghost amen
[42:43] but one guy that when they believe one
[42:45] shouted one cried one Biff one that is
[42:52] that your prophet but listen it's always
[43:02] been the Holy Spirit go in the church
[43:05] age book and pull it up and they'll say
[43:07] the Holy Spirit is makes the Holy Ghost
[43:09] by things that only fear in every age
[43:11] it's a title of a section of it and
[43:16] we'll read statements of this one day
[43:20] when we get a same Holy Ghost justified
[43:22] to Luther sanctified immense this
[43:24] baptized up kind of call same Holy Ghost
[43:28] he said the Holy Ghost in this age hold
[43:30] it goes in this age holding those knee
[43:31] say okay it was the word that was eighth
[43:33] down that was a favorite statement of my
[43:38] wife years ago it's been the word this
[43:40] watchman ate down not the Holy Spirit
[43:42] there's no such thing is taking away the
[43:44] Holy Spirit you'd have to take a candle
[43:46] out so no I say stuff like that and you
[43:52] think I'm arrogant and hateful I'll take
[43:56] it but he said then when the Holy Spirit
[44:00] this is off the message why is it that
[44:03] so many Christians find it hard to live
[44:06] the Christian life and did when the Holy
[44:10] Spirit comes down and says now let's
[44:15] read it here
[44:16] that we're we're um yeah we need to
[44:21] bring need to bring it up to y'all but
[44:25] down to us all right listen he talks
[44:30] about an old rawhide
[44:31] you know when talking about putting new
[44:34] wine in old bottles in the skins okay if
[44:38] you say the baptism of the holy spirit
[44:39] was promised onto their Pentecost to you
[44:42] and to your children and to them that
[44:44] are far off even as many as the Lord our
[44:46] God shall call the old dry skin just
[44:48] burst open
[44:49] they don't believe it right and you lose
[44:53] your sermon I like that that's right it
[44:57] doesn't do any good and I'm ashamed that
[44:59] Pentecostal skins are drying like that
[45:01] that's right come back to the word now
[45:04] listen notice now a new skin he said the
[45:08] new wine is put in the new bottles and
[45:10] the new skin has all in it flexible and
[45:14] then when the Holy Spirit comes down and
[45:16] says now when the Holy Spirit comes down
[45:22] and says the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[45:25] is the same today as it ever was in
[45:27] other words we have no right to
[45:31] disbelieve that or discount down or try
[45:34] to figure it out I said well I believe
[45:36] it's over there I believe this happen
[45:37] anyway that's exactly right
[45:39] when the Holy Spirit comes down and says
[45:42] it you can't argue right divine healing
[45:47] is the same as it ever was the new wine
[45:50] begins to spread the word is preached in
[45:53] its power but are you listening it's
[45:57] been a Holy Ghost in every age always
[45:59] has been the Holy Ghost and always will
[46:01] be the Holy Ghost all right now we're
[46:05] going to start reading that we're going
[46:08] to read if you didn't have your notes
[46:10] you don't we'll follow it from here I
[46:11] want to read this tonight together if
[46:13] nothing else I've preached parts of it
[46:15] and trying to get you to think on it but
[46:17] listen all right go ahead and we'll
[46:18] start on number six yeah you got it
[46:24] okay this'll be one page 144 from the
[46:28] Summerlin Church eight it'll go
[46:30] 20:44 145 146 147 and 148 a continual
[46:36] reading all right now what he says in
[46:42] here we must take code I know what
[46:46] you'll do
[46:47] I know what most people do I don't
[46:49] believe in the church age book okay so
[46:54] you're out so you they believe in the
[46:57] church age move you're in what we're
[47:00] talking about then I want you to show me
[47:04] where the church age looks wrong that's
[47:06] all I've ever say it now so you can see
[47:09] now in okay
[47:11] that we cannot afford to say what the
[47:14] Bible has not said when the scripture
[47:18] teaches us that the work of the Holy
[47:21] Spirit and the manifestation of that
[47:25] blessed person is to bring the truth of
[47:29] each age to the true seed of that age
[47:34] all right then we didn't know that the
[47:38] Spirit has to be abiding in the person
[47:40] or he cannot receive that fruit for that
[47:43] time amen that's exactly correct what
[47:46] did he say he said if you didn't have it
[47:48] every way he put a misinterpretation to
[47:50] it and go off into sin that's in the
[47:51] church he's booked up oh brother Larry
[47:54] my car shaking his head uh-huh go me and
[47:56] him used to talking about the church age
[47:57] book back when I first come into message
[47:59] you know you know you live that church
[48:02] age booth okay now listen so we're going
[48:07] up to number two then we'll go three and
[48:09] like four I think and it was young when
[48:12] it's emerging church age or the church
[48:14] age book page 144 now before we leave
[48:17] this subject I want to make myself very
[48:19] clear on what the baptism of the Holy
[48:22] Ghost is according to the word it is not
[48:26] according to me it is not according to
[48:28] you it has to be according to thus saith
[48:31] the Lord are we are falsely led now I
[48:35] think I think that's a pretty good apex
[48:38] don't you I think that's a pretty good
[48:43] top apex top so anything else that's
[48:49] down underneath there is going to have
[48:51] to line up to come out to the right
[48:55] thing but it's a pretty good apex to
[48:58] somebody say thus saith the Lord as a
[49:03] matter of fact we were listening to
[49:05] really Vale the other night on the
[49:07] internet if you've on the internet you
[49:09] got a lot of testimonies on our you
[49:10] ought to go in there and pull them up
[49:11] and read listen to it and he was talking
[49:14] about this very point that wrote a
[49:16] random told him said in other words put
[49:17] it there he made this statement
[49:20] something about he said you've got it
[49:23] right put it in there and evidently he
[49:27] must have been arguing the point but I
[49:30] think I don't worry about it that's
[49:32] business but listen it has to be
[49:35] according to the cell order we're
[49:36] falsely laying now come on to begin with
[49:39] you will notice that in my meetings when
[49:41] I finished preaching and an evangelistic
[49:43] --all now I'll try to this run-through
[49:45] feist on this and you read but I asked
[49:48] them to come forward and receive the
[49:49] Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon
[49:52] hearing me say this believe that I am
[49:55] inviting people to come forward to be
[49:56] baptized with the Holy Ghost now listen
[49:58] to it because they are already born
[50:01] again now he's asking them to come be
[50:03] baptized with the Holy Ghost but they're
[50:05] putting in their saying something
[50:10] they're all thinking it's already born
[50:12] again they're putting it wrong all right
[50:15] so when I invite those who are spirit
[50:18] filled to come and deal with those who
[50:20] have answered invitation to receive the
[50:23] Holy Spirit these dear one search for
[50:25] word and deal with the people in such
[50:27] manner as to encourage them to yield to
[50:30] God and believe to speaking in speak in
[50:33] tongues this has caused a great deal of
[50:35] confusion now I want to make I want to
[50:41] tell you exactly what I mean
[50:44] that's a pretty good statement what does
[50:48] he mean when he gives an altar call they
[50:52] misunderstand and think he's doing this
[50:54] and they need to incur
[50:55] speaking talk he didn't say that he said
[50:57] I'm sure I'll give the altar call to
[51:00] come and be baptized with the Holy
[51:02] Spirit okay
[51:05] I want to tell you exactly what I mean I
[51:08] mean for the sinner to come forward and
[51:11] be born again remember the statement
[51:14] hook oh butter I've never made a
[51:16] statement I've got the altar open
[51:18] tonight for them that needs to be
[51:19] justified y'all come on get justified
[51:21] and then we'll put you over here let's
[51:22] get sanctified
[51:23] they'll put you over no you always say
[51:25] it come and receive the new birth the
[51:30] morning experience or the baptism of the
[51:32] Holy Ghost one of the three statements
[51:34] will be made okay I mean for the sinner
[51:39] to come forward and be born again listen
[51:42] what is to be born again which is to be
[51:45] baptized into the body of Christ by the
[51:47] Holy Ghost
[51:50] that's your born-again experience what
[51:52] Jesus was teaching just by the Holy
[51:56] Ghost which is exactly what took place
[51:58] at Pentecost when the church was
[52:02] launched men and brethren what once we
[52:07] do to be saved well you need to come
[52:09] down here and get justified you need to
[52:12] come here where pray for you get
[52:13] sanctified they had to go through that
[52:16] but that question was not asked meaning
[52:20] brother what must we do to we say repeat
[52:21] every one and be baptized the name of
[52:23] Jesus Christ for efficiency and you
[52:24] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:26] that puts justification sanctification
[52:28] to baptism Holy Ghost in line but you're
[52:30] not giving out a call for that you're
[52:32] giving out a call for the new birth or
[52:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[52:36] born-again experience exactly what took
[52:43] place is Pentecost when the church was
[52:44] launched in other words to be born to
[52:47] the Spirit is to be truly baptized with
[52:50] the Holy Ghost it's one and the same
[52:55] okay now when we get over to saying this
[52:59] about the new birth and this about the
[53:01] born-again experience I will reread that
[53:03] where you won't forget okay because you
[53:09] know those statements were brother
[53:11] Brennan said I can conclusively prove
[53:13] that you're born again and baptized into
[53:15] the body
[53:16] I say that is 1000% correct but it sure
[53:21] does sound a lot
[53:25] it sure does sound wrong don't it agreed
[53:32] where he said you begin your eternal
[53:34] life right here at the altar but any
[53:36] turns around says you don't get any
[53:38] turtle out till you get the baptism in
[53:39] the Holy Spirit the two statements of
[53:46] both of them's right that's the
[53:54] simplicity of the message in our if you
[53:56] put it in simplicity now we're reading
[54:00] on see we're going up to number four
[54:01] partner someone I realized that it's
[54:03] going to be confusing for a moment here
[54:05] as most people know that I was ordained
[54:07] a Baptist preacher and I have
[54:09] steadfastly to declare that the
[54:10] Baptist's have missed it by saying you
[54:13] receive the Holy Ghost when you believe
[54:15] for that is not so you receive him since
[54:22] you believe in us that and deliver
[54:29] receive the Holy Ghost since you believe
[54:30] and they said unto Him we have not so
[54:33] much as heard whether they're being able
[54:34] to go how was he baptized and all to go
[54:36] and keep coming up there it is Paul
[54:39] asked have you received the Holy have
[54:42] you received since not when you believe
[54:45] and there is a great difference there
[54:47] for it is after we believe that we
[54:50] receive that will be the
[54:53] answer to why a lot of it looks contrary
[54:56] one to the other you'll remember those
[55:01] statements then whom also after that you
[55:03] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[55:05] your salvation whom also after you
[55:06] believed not when you believed you were
[55:08] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise
[55:11] we just read that scripture there is my
[55:13] point to many of our modernistic and
[55:17] even our fundamentalist so-called now
[55:20] this is what they believe believe it the
[55:22] salvation that is first certain specific
[55:25] time which in many cases is called
[55:27] making a decision and that has been
[55:30] called receiving Christ are being born
[55:32] again hmm now watching this that's their
[55:38] statement here's his statement all right
[55:40] are you reading that's their statement
[55:42] here's his statement read it they making
[55:46] a decision and that has been called
[55:47] receiving Christ or being born again
[55:49] that's their statements now to receive
[55:53] Christ is to receive his spirit to
[55:56] receive his Spirit is to be born again
[55:58] to receive His Spirit is to be baptized
[56:00] with the Holy Ghost amen
[56:02] these folks believe that is wonderful
[56:04] but they stop there you receive the Holy
[56:09] Ghost
[56:10] after you believed it was always been
[56:12] that has always been that way and always
[56:16] will be the very first word of direction
[56:19] to the people was by Peter at Pentecost
[56:22] and he said repent I want to be baptized
[56:25] in the name of Jesus Christ promises
[56:26] through the urine to your children the
[56:28] Lord our God shall call now we're going
[56:30] to know we're getting paid 145 we're
[56:32] doing good
[56:32] these direction came at direct answer
[56:35] from Peter relative to what he had
[56:37] actually what had actually happened at
[56:40] Pentecost
[56:40] what came to Pais was that God according
[56:43] to Joel what came to pass at Pinnacle
[56:45] was what according to Joel was pouring
[56:49] out the promise of the Holy Spirit upon
[56:51] all flesh he was not poured out before
[56:53] that time are given before that time
[56:56] this was it but this was to come from
[57:00] now on by repeating the in baptized in
[57:03] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[57:04] then God was duty-bound to
[57:06] the ones who came Peter now listen are
[57:10] any of the Apostles never saying you
[57:18] must be born again and then fill with
[57:24] the Holy Spirit we're going to read
[57:29] statements where brother Brown looks
[57:30] like he says some contrary but remember
[57:34] this is the apex
[57:37] he said well these others could be over
[57:39] here and it's gonna be with I argue of
[57:40] it you won't never get to her because
[57:44] you ain't gonna keep you three stages
[57:45] together
[57:46] you're never gonna keep justification
[57:48] the same case in the baptism of Holy
[57:50] Ghost running in the correct line if you
[57:52] don't approach it correctly you'll never
[57:53] get the born-again experience the new
[57:55] birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:57] will be one in the same if you don't
[58:00] keep it correctly okay so he said none
[58:07] of the Apostles never said it okay where
[58:09] we at well 1:45 let's go we got to 146
[58:15] yeah 145 145 1 146 this is a
[58:23] continuation now that this is the
[58:27] pattern of experience relating to
[58:29] receiving the Holy Spirit notice
[58:31] carefully the very next time that the
[58:33] spirit fell upon the people now this is
[58:35] Acts and Philip when a Samaria you know
[58:38] and their priests crossing to them and
[58:39] and that the Philip came and they've got
[58:42] all the things rolled I don't know you
[58:43] can read your scriptures and know that
[58:45] it's true just keep on going do we get
[58:47] to the yellow part come on up or y'all
[58:51] going down we say up y'all go down every
[58:54] what it takes to get it go that away who
[58:57] when they were come down they thought
[59:00] Peter John and then you read your
[59:02] scriptures in between prayed for them
[59:06] that they might receive the Holy Ghost
[59:07] you remember one of those time in there
[59:09] that may be the one you remember one of
[59:10] them in there they couldn't get the Holy
[59:12] Ghost to come on to people they had to
[59:15] send for Peter was it Peter and John
[59:16] they sent for they said for two of the
[59:18] others to come and they came down and
[59:19] prayed for him
[59:20] the ghosts came home they must have been
[59:22] a little something that wasn't exactly
[59:23] right
[59:24] now I don't know what it was but there
[59:28] was something he didn't come on them but
[59:30] these two came he came on them you came
[59:34] said just the body because these others
[59:35] is trying to get him they was in the
[59:36] body too maybe they didn't understand
[59:40] the new birth exactly maybe they were
[59:44] trying to say you spoke in tongues you
[59:45] just how did you believe this may be a
[59:49] okay don't he'd fallen upon none of them
[59:53] only they were baptized to the name of
[59:55] the Lord Jesus he laid hands on them
[59:57] they received according to verse 12 they
[59:59] believe the word they were baptized in
[1:00:04] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:06] but according to verse 16 in spite of
[1:00:10] all that they had still not received the
[1:00:14] Holy Spirit it was only after believing
[1:00:19] in being baptized correctly did they
[1:00:20] receive the Holy Ghost this is the exact
[1:00:23] pattern as set forth by Peter in acts
[1:00:26] 2:38 and 39 which this means under day
[1:00:29] of Pentecost
[1:00:29] I like these right come on move it on
[1:00:32] you can get your scriptural reading in
[1:00:34] between now by me by no means now listen
[1:00:41] you find out and read your scripture
[1:00:44] because that's what he's talking about
[1:00:45] now by no means can it be said that the
[1:00:49] blessings of Abraham
[1:00:50] I remember we discussed this in the
[1:00:53] Baptist Church okay that she had two
[1:00:55] blessings of Abraham and it on the
[1:00:57] Gentiles and you had to the Jews were
[1:00:59] their part we discussed that in the
[1:01:01] Baptist Church I remember that now by no
[1:01:03] means can it be said that the blessings
[1:01:05] of Abraham is the new birth and that the
[1:01:10] promise of the Spirit is the baptism
[1:01:12] with the Holy Ghost as two separate
[1:01:15] events I remember that was discussed in
[1:01:22] the Baptist Church but it was at the
[1:01:23] Holy Ghost Gentiles and things all right
[1:01:27] we'll see watch Beth now by no means can
[1:01:30] it be said that the blessing of Abraham
[1:01:32] is the new
[1:01:33] earth and that the promise of the Spirit
[1:01:37] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:39] as two separate events for the scripture
[1:01:42] does reach Jesus died on the cross and
[1:01:44] by means of that death and resurrection
[1:01:46] the blessings of Abraham came on the
[1:01:49] Gentiles leaving the Jews this
[1:01:51] transpired in order that the spirit
[1:01:53] might become available to the Gentile
[1:01:57] continue on I want to get these read 147
[1:02:03] still in the smyrna church a to
[1:02:05] understand what i have just said is to
[1:02:09] clear up one students have never found
[1:02:14] you just have never found paul saying at
[1:02:18] any time be born again and then be
[1:02:21] spirit filled you can't find it he's
[1:02:29] teaching you born again any teaching
[1:02:33] your spirit filled and then this that or
[1:02:36] the other up and down he's teaching the
[1:02:37] overhead straight across listen
[1:02:40] they haven't fared it to be though it is
[1:02:43] dire and they have put their own meaning
[1:02:46] to make it say it but scripture does not
[1:02:49] say that jesus never said it either and
[1:02:52] he goes into john and you read that john
[1:02:55] and all with this fake now that's the
[1:02:57] warrant this spake he of the holy spirit
[1:02:59] which they that believe on him should
[1:03:01] receive for the Holy Ghost had not come
[1:03:03] yet not yet given because that Jesus was
[1:03:07] not yet glorified let me start right
[1:03:09] here to say something you know that's an
[1:03:11] argument among the people of this
[1:03:12] message used to be in the seventies that
[1:03:15] Holy Ghost with one thing the Holy
[1:03:16] Spirit was another thing okay
[1:03:25] I don't believe it now it says here that
[1:03:28] distinctly and emphatically that the
[1:03:31] believer upon drinkin by coming unto
[1:03:33] Jesus in faith would have rivers of
[1:03:36] living waters pouring out of him and it
[1:03:39] places that experience at Pentecost come
[1:03:44] on up we're getting to the point of real
[1:03:46] same living water is mentioned but this
[1:03:49] time it's not called a river it's called
[1:03:51] an artesian well there is where the
[1:03:53] people make the mistake because it is
[1:03:58] called a whale and a river they think
[1:04:04] that in one place it is eternal life
[1:04:06] given by the spirit and in the next
[1:04:09] place where it is called a river
[1:04:11] implying a great dynamics it has to be
[1:04:14] the spirit now giving you an inn Dumont
[1:04:17] of power this is not so but you know we
[1:04:28] got one scripture we got to deal with
[1:04:30] when the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[1:04:32] receive power that's Scripture the Holy
[1:04:40] Spirit comes upon he's read for this new
[1:04:41] power he looked like they had arrived
[1:04:43] but they had something wrong it is one
[1:04:46] in the same it is a spirit that gives
[1:04:49] life and power and that came at
[1:04:51] Pentecost and he starts talking about
[1:04:53] experience going to roll it have you
[1:04:56] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:04:57] believe this is the whole of our problem
[1:05:00] right here people repent of their sins
[1:05:03] they get baptized in water but they
[1:05:06] don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:05:09] now wants you you believe unto receiving
[1:05:16] the spirit that would be very very
[1:05:18] valuable later on because that's what
[1:05:21] you have to do it you have to believe
[1:05:24] under receiving but the people stop they
[1:05:28] go as far as the water and then stop
[1:05:30] they believe and then stop the Bible
[1:05:33] does not say that you receive when you
[1:05:34] believe it is have you received the Holy
[1:05:37] Ghost since you believe
[1:05:38] the exact and literal translation is did
[1:05:42] you having previously believed receive
[1:05:44] the Holy Ghost the people believe and
[1:05:47] then stop you don't receive the Holy
[1:05:50] Ghost when you believe unto Him that
[1:05:56] sound like a fury saying you do know
[1:05:59] he's saying you don't duh you don't get
[1:06:03] the Holy Ghost when you believe you get
[1:06:08] the Holy Ghost when that believing is
[1:06:09] accepted of God okay
[1:06:15] the people bleed and then stop you don't
[1:06:18] receive the Holy Ghost when you believe
[1:06:19] unto him having repented you go own and
[1:06:23] receive the Holy Ghost you got to keep
[1:06:26] on going do you see it
[1:06:28] that is what is wrong with our
[1:06:31] fundamentalist they have no power for
[1:06:34] they stopped short of Pentecost okay
[1:06:39] come on up
[1:06:47] he's talking about they're just like the
[1:06:48] children of Israel they stopped short of
[1:06:50] the promised land so come on up there
[1:06:52] was only two real true believers come
[1:06:54] out of the whole thing right then since
[1:06:57] that is so and only two entered then the
[1:07:00] rest were not true believers and he's
[1:07:02] just explaining what these others were
[1:07:04] do it by rejecting and thinking they're
[1:07:06] believing this what made the difference
[1:07:08] to stayed with the words when the heart
[1:07:11] of the ten spies failed at Katie's bar
[1:07:13] near Josh when Caleb did not stagger for
[1:07:15] they believe the word and said were more
[1:07:18] than able to take the land they knew
[1:07:21] they could because God had said had said
[1:07:24] I have given you the land after all
[1:07:28] those Israelites saw all the power and
[1:07:30] the goodness and deliverance of God they
[1:07:33] did not enter into the rest which is the
[1:07:36] top of the Holy Ghost so you see right
[1:07:38] now that very few will ever believe all
[1:07:42] the way to receiving the Spirit of God I
[1:07:47] didn't say these things he's putting
[1:07:52] people up in different categories and we
[1:07:54] will too that you got justification you
[1:07:57] got sanctification you got the baptism
[1:07:59] you got a lot of things to deal with but
[1:08:02] there's no way all right
[1:08:05] how far did we get are we on what 148
[1:08:11] we've got that one or am i okay
[1:08:22] okay we stop there so let's go wow okay
[1:08:30] let's go to the next go to Levin okay we
[1:08:34] still got it right we just got numbers
[1:08:35] we'll deal with now here is where the
[1:08:38] profit is saying what is the whole ego
[1:08:40] that's a message he pries upon this
[1:08:44] place we wish to approach the subject
[1:08:46] which i think is the outstanding subject
[1:08:50] of the day and the what is the holy
[1:08:53] spirit what is it
[1:08:55] and now the reason I've taken the
[1:08:57] subject in line like this now read this
[1:09:01] over and over and over and listen to him
[1:09:07] now's everybody awaiting took up enough
[1:09:10] to read it cause listen to it he said
[1:09:15] it's an outstanding subject alright what
[1:09:19] is the holy spirit what is it now the
[1:09:21] reason I've taken the subject in line
[1:09:24] like this you cannot come cannot come
[1:09:27] and receive the Holy Spirit unless you
[1:09:31] know what it is well God understands he
[1:09:37] understands me and he did it he said you
[1:09:41] can't receive it unless you know what it
[1:09:44] is what is the Holy Spirit we just
[1:09:50] established the born-again experience
[1:09:52] the new birth and the baptism the Holy
[1:09:54] Spirit is one an assignment what is the
[1:10:03] baptism and why would he good
[1:10:06] you cannot come and receive the Holy
[1:10:09] Spirit unless you know what it is and
[1:10:14] you cannot receive it now listen if you
[1:10:20] know what it is and you cannot receive
[1:10:26] it if you know what it is unless you
[1:10:31] believe it's given to you
[1:10:34] now how many statements if I made that
[1:10:37] you got to believe it's for you
[1:10:41] what's it and then you cannot know
[1:10:43] whether you've got it or not unless you
[1:10:51] know what the results it brain so if you
[1:10:58] know what it is and who it's to
[1:11:02] and what action it brings when it comes
[1:11:07] then you'll know what you've got when
[1:11:10] you get it is that it just settles it
[1:11:16] but I remember you so well
[1:11:19] you making it too complicated we just
[1:11:22] come to the altar and we get the kids to
[1:11:27] come you need to explain this to them
[1:11:29] you need to explain it what's good
[1:11:31] what's the thing you need to explain it
[1:11:33] they need to be born again and to be
[1:11:36] bored again they got to get the baptism
[1:11:38] of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:38] oh no but going again is just believing
[1:11:41] now you're off you're out of line
[1:11:45] because that's the whole thing of

[1:14:34] daughter or Becky Beth they're big what

[1:15:22] we get tickled over that cuz they say in
[1:15:24] an hour that actually up means down when
[1:15:27] they're trying to roll it and wow I get
[1:15:30] tickled at that that's why I am anyway
[1:15:32] I'm upside down
[1:15:33] 154 to learn in church age after he's
[1:15:36] explained all of these other things
[1:15:38] about it you're coming up to 154 which
[1:15:40] we'd come up to 148 reading in broke off
[1:15:43] and a lot of that next goes with
[1:15:45] evidence or the Holy Ghost etc different
[1:15:47] thing okay now listen brother branham
[1:15:52] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:55] you say hey didn't say brother Randall
[1:15:57] no I said brother branham what is it I
[1:15:59] want to know what is the baptism with
[1:16:02] the holy God
[1:16:03] it's the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:16:05] body of Christ it is the new birth it is
[1:16:13] the Spirit of God coming in and filling
[1:16:15] you after you have repented having heard
[1:16:17] his word and been baptized in water as
[1:16:20] an answer of a good conscience toward
[1:16:22] God what is the baptism of the holdest
[1:16:27] goes brother branham i like to throw
[1:16:34] these things out not caught how smart I
[1:16:35] am but what I know has already been in
[1:16:38] the mind of mankind because I faced it
[1:16:40] for 40 years see some would say what is
[1:16:44] the baptism that he said with the Holy
[1:16:47] Ghost that's different than being the
[1:16:48] Holy Ghost I've been their fault ease
[1:16:54] out and I'm not afraid to say God's Word
[1:16:58] is still true I'm still with that all
[1:17:02] right this is what do you think what is
[1:17:05] the baptism with the Holy Spirit
[1:17:07] it's the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:17:09] body of Christ it is the new bar so the
[1:17:11] baptism in the Holy Spirit a new birth
[1:17:12] must be the
[1:17:15] and we read that while ago where the
[1:17:17] baptism the Holy Ghost in an uber the
[1:17:19] born-again experience is the same so
[1:17:24] we're still we've got that point so what
[1:17:27] is he going well we have just set forth
[1:17:29] would be much easier for all to
[1:17:31] understand if all believe the doctrine
[1:17:34] of the oneness for the Godhead where
[1:17:36] there are not three persons in that
[1:17:37] Godhead but one thus we are not born
[1:17:44] again by the spirit of life of Jesus
[1:17:48] Christ coming in then subsequent which
[1:17:50] means director - that the Holy Spirit
[1:17:56] coming in to give us power but brother
[1:18:00] branham the Bible says you shall receive
[1:18:04] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:18:06] you see those things will have to come
[1:18:14] into order if that were true if it was
[1:18:21] true that you're born again by the
[1:18:23] Spirit of God you know life coming in
[1:18:25] Jesus Christ and then after that you
[1:18:28] receive some kind of Holy Spirit coming
[1:18:29] in to give us power now let me stop here
[1:18:32] and say this and then we'll be back to
[1:18:35] it the same Holy Ghost is justified -
[1:18:39] Luther sanctified - Methodist Baptist
[1:18:41] Pentecostal justification is work of the
[1:18:44] Holy Spirit sanctification is working
[1:18:46] the holds here but the baptism is the
[1:18:47] Holy Spirit
[1:18:48] I'm quoting brother Branham so if you
[1:18:52] wanted to say that you're born again by
[1:18:55] believing you know you want to say that
[1:19:00] and either say but what I need to do
[1:19:02] then I need to get the baptism - coma
[1:19:05] spirit
[1:19:05] no it's one spirit it's one God it may
[1:19:09] come in many different ways or what are
[1:19:14] the three stages of grace not works
[1:19:17] stages justice came st. case in the
[1:19:21] baptism of Holy Ghost completes the
[1:19:22] birth right constitute now
[1:19:27] use the word in the correct order
[1:19:28] constitutes anywhere because if you run
[1:19:30] that in about the completes and you work
[1:19:32] you're gonna have to find it over here
[1:19:34] to fit with that and together okay I try
[1:19:37] to save you time is that we're true if
[1:19:42] it was true that we get some kind of one
[1:19:44] birth here and then we got to get a
[1:19:46] baptism over here they'd never done that
[1:19:50] but yet this is the baptism of the holy
[1:19:57] spirit of faith this is a baptism of the
[1:19:59] holy spirit of the Apostle this is a
[1:20:02] baptism of the Holy Spirit it's three
[1:20:05] stages look are you listening to what
[1:20:13] I'm saying if you get justified that's
[1:20:16] the work of the Holy Spirit if you stay
[1:20:19] alright in that stage it's gonna move
[1:20:20] into sanctification I mean if you stay
[1:20:24] in that stage it's gonna move into the
[1:20:25] baptism of the holy God so what's the
[1:20:28] Holy Ghost all the way it's not what
[1:20:32] holy goes here one holy goes here the
[1:20:37] day he was justified it was the Holy
[1:20:38] Ghost that done the help today you were
[1:20:41] sanctified it was the Holy Ghost that
[1:20:43] done that the day you received the
[1:20:46] baptism it was the Holy Ghost that done
[1:20:47] that it's not all messed up if that were
[1:20:55] true look why would we dishonor the
[1:20:57] father go now listen one time about
[1:21:00] Jesus coming in be the son Holy Spirit
[1:21:03] coming in will be the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:05] then you left the father out of your
[1:21:06] religion goes now to listen what he say
[1:21:09] see we're dishonor than the father what
[1:21:11] are you gonna let him do not giving him
[1:21:14] a part in your in our complete salvation
[1:21:16] for our salvation is of the Lord and
[1:21:19] there are three Lords then he father
[1:21:23] must have something to do do but surely
[1:21:27] it can be seen that Jesus made this very
[1:21:30] clear that it was he and he alone who is
[1:21:35] God and that it is he and he alone who
[1:21:39] is coming into the
[1:21:41] livre John 14:16 said that the father
[1:21:46] will says that the father will come a
[1:21:48] father will send another comforter that
[1:21:50] looks like - today I'm working verse 17
[1:21:53] says that he dwelleth with me and he'll
[1:21:55] be in me verse 18 says that he'll come
[1:21:59] to them who Jesus verse 23 and speaking
[1:22:03] to the disciples he said we father and
[1:22:05] son will come unto thee I love that one
[1:22:08] I love this statement thus it is the
[1:22:16] Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in
[1:22:24] at the one time for it is one person
[1:22:30] comprising the Godhead that Advent took
[1:22:36] place at Pentecost listen there aren't
[1:22:40] two comings he's the one wait a minute
[1:22:44] you just said here's the Holy Spirit and
[1:22:46] here's the Holy Spirit and here's the
[1:22:48] Holy Spirit right but there's only one
[1:22:50] coming that one coming this finished up
[1:22:52] into those three manifestations that
[1:22:56] Advent took place at Pentecost there
[1:22:58] aren't two comings of the Spirit
[1:23:00] just one the trouble is that people
[1:23:01] don't know the real truth and they
[1:23:03] simply believe in Jesus for a remission
[1:23:05] of sins but never going to receive the
[1:23:08] Spirit what about it they never go on to
[1:23:13] receive the Spirit this is if I can cut
[1:23:16] off and quit of what I can do let me get
[1:23:26] a couple of these and then we'll quit go
[1:23:29] to 13 this is a message called
[1:23:33] fellowship now the elements that came
[1:23:38] from the body of Jesus was water blood
[1:23:40] and spirit what came from his natural
[1:23:43] body is what constitutes the new birth
[1:23:46] water blood spirit just kidding same
[1:23:48] case baptism Holy Ghost anything you
[1:23:50] wanted to run through
[1:23:55] what come from his natural body is what
[1:24:00] constitutes the new work you know we
[1:24:01] talking about there's not his natural
[1:24:03] body that runs out and gives it to its
[1:24:05] typing it or signifying it or placing it
[1:24:08] said what's what is when a baby is born
[1:24:11] what's the first thing these went to it
[1:24:13] what constitutes the natural birth is
[1:24:15] the top of the spiritual birth what is
[1:24:18] the first thing water its water for
[1:24:21] separation
[1:24:22] justification by faith as the brother
[1:24:24] read the scripture this morning Romans 8
[1:24:27] or Romans 5 justification by faith
[1:24:29] what's the next thing the cleansing
[1:24:31] sanctification taking the new mug and
[1:24:34] all and what's the knife it comes down
[1:24:36] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:38] okay let's get one more hidden life and
[1:24:45] that's the same thing it takes to make
[1:24:47] up the new birth now let me say this
[1:24:50] there's no point I hope by now we have
[1:24:55] found enough to understand and read
[1:24:58] enough from the Prophet to know what the
[1:25:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost is it is not
[1:25:04] shouting it is not speaking in tongues
[1:25:06] it is not crying
[1:25:07] those are after-effects it is as we read
[1:25:12] over all ago what is the baptism of the
[1:25:14] Holy Ghost it is the new birth it is a
[1:25:18] spirit of God coming in and filling you
[1:25:21] after you have repented having heard the
[1:25:25] word what is the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:29] Spirit it is the new birth what is the
[1:25:35] new birth it's the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:36] Spirit
[1:25:36] what is the born-again experience the
[1:25:38] baptism of the Holy Spirit it's the
[1:25:40] born-again experience okay so watch
[1:25:48] that's the same thing that it takes to
[1:25:50] make up to new burrow water blood and
[1:25:51] spirit justification my faith believing
[1:25:53] on the Lord Jesus Christ cleansing up
[1:25:55] the sanctifying through the blood then
[1:25:56] the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you
[1:25:58] in the holiest of Holies
[1:25:59] now that constitutes the man who is
[1:26:01] separated from God and hid away in
[1:26:03] Christ

[1:28:00] here they brother branham's they say
[1:28:01] Godhead or what it he said is not
[1:28:03] complete without you there's a statement
[1:28:06] to that it's either God not complete
[1:28:09] without you or the Godhead is not
[1:28:10] complete without you because you're a
[1:28:12] part of God if you have the new birth

[1:28:56] new birth right now whether were is
[1:28:59] there any thing in there relating to any
[1:29:03] fleshly manner or anything so why do you

[1:29:11] in the new birth is the birth like I
[1:29:14] tried to explain the other day the baby
[1:29:16] normal baby now we exited some other if
[1:29:22] it don't cry it's wiggling muscles up
[1:29:27] but it's not alive

[1:29:32] mile and they either blow into the mouth
[1:29:34] which I'd like that part or either bread
[1:29:37] run said you strike him and he screamed
[1:29:39] out speaking in tongues another Newburgh
[1:29:45] the babies already died see you're

[1:29:54] experience you will howl of joy please
[1:30:02] goodness meekness long-suffering at
[1:30:03] least one out of there that's what you
[1:30:10] think and I'm against experiences and
[1:30:12] done now I'd like to tell the truth and
[1:30:14] then have the experiences because look
[1:30:16] what is the new bar it's revelation
[1:30:19] Jesus Christ personally to you oh you
[1:30:24] mean a new birth is a revelation you
[1:30:28] mean a new the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:29] is a revelation
[1:30:30] I will pick it up Sunday I ask you to go
[1:30:35] read the book of Acts they said to come
[1:30:40] a mighty rushing wind that wouldn't a
[1:30:43] baptism said tongues the flyer said on
[1:30:47] each one of them God brother branham
[1:30:50] said questions and answer God was
[1:30:53] dividing himself among the people it was
[1:30:57] not the rushing wind it was the liquor
[1:31:01] fire it was the revelation it was God
[1:31:07] quickening what Peter had what John had
[1:31:10] what the others had you're gonna find
[1:31:16] out now from now on you're gonna find
[1:31:17] that brother Brian my brother Dale
[1:31:18] believes at one time the new birth the
[1:31:21] baptism in the Holy Ghost and the
[1:31:23] born-again experience is one in the same
[1:31:24] and it is a revelation so then now I'm
[1:31:28] not going to ask you to I ask you to
[1:31:31] tell me what your experience is I've
[1:31:39] asked
[1:31:39] that what is your experience tell me
[1:31:44] what happened to you
[1:31:45] my brother Tatum was I can tell probably
[1:31:48] Lona brother Tatum was sitting under a
[1:31:50] tree and raindrops it's like falling
[1:31:52] down out of the sky that's wonderful
[1:31:57] what do you call your experience what do
[1:32:00] you put your salvation home
[1:32:03] I believe the prophets met with the
[1:32:05] devil beat us to it
[1:32:08] give me the one thing that he can't
[1:32:11] argue with come on give me the one thing
[1:32:16] that the devil can't argue with the
[1:32:18] revealed word but one said he cannot
[1:32:23] bring the word word by word so now
[1:32:26] you're gonna wonder about it and you're
[1:32:27] gonna loop it out and everything yeah
[1:32:30] but how long has it being wage got a
[1:32:32] better memory how long has it been since

[1:33:18] sitting right there when I first read
[1:33:20] the Bible in the Baptist Church I read
[1:33:24] over and I got over to Malachi 3 and
[1:33:26] Malachi 4 and I told her I said before
[1:33:29] the end of time comes according to the
[1:33:32] Bible there'll be two prophets coming I
[1:33:36] couldn't get it straight now I knew
[1:33:38] about the ones when he said I mean I
[1:33:40] knew about the Luke 1:17 we could read
[1:33:43] scripture we could put John the Baptist
[1:33:46] in and bring him in but we couldn't get
[1:33:49] that fourth guy you know what I mean
[1:33:52] so I said to brother mold he said well
[1:33:54] God sent us a prophet I said okay
[1:33:56] brother
[1:33:56] now put him in the word he said behold I
[1:34:01] send you Elijah the prophet he turned
[1:34:03] the hearts with you I said okay now I
[1:34:04] explained Malachi 3 he explained Malachi
[1:34:08] 3 of John the Baptist I knew he knew
[1:34:10] what he's talking about so what's your
[1:34:12] favorite scripture it might be that you
[1:34:16] want windup one of these days finding
[1:34:18] out that is your new birth when that
[1:34:21] scripture is made alive to you you
[1:34:26] definitely don't think that the entire
[1:34:29] Bible has got to be revealed to you just
[1:34:31] even say you got the new birth do you
[1:34:36] okay what is it what is the new birth in
[1:34:42] you'd say well brother around and what
[1:34:44] isn't he where it's revelation Jesus
[1:34:46] Christ personally you know listen not
[1:34:48] you joined a church you shook a hand you
[1:34:50] done something different you said a
[1:34:54] Creed you promised to live by coda rules
[1:34:58] but Christ the Bible he is the word that
[1:35:01] was revealed to you and no matter what
[1:35:04] anybody else says what takes place
[1:35:07] it's Christ pastor priests or whatever
[1:35:11] it might be is Christ in you it's a
[1:35:13] revelation of the church is built upon
[1:35:16] you remember what the disciples were
[1:35:18] sitting up in the upper room and
[1:35:22] something happened right the Holy Ghost
[1:35:26] came and they went outside and what did
[1:35:29] they say somewhere right there in the
[1:35:36] fourth act I'm not come on this is that
[1:35:41] that was spoken of by the Prophet show
[1:35:46] me anywhere in the Bible or prophets
[1:35:49] message either way anybody ever received
[1:35:51] the Holy Ghost and it ain't word related
[1:35:52] our quickening of the word and you
[1:35:55] shorten tell me any word it's not
[1:36:01] something related to the word the
[1:36:02] quickening of the word
[1:36:09] so we order know what to do birth is
[1:36:13] it's a quickening of the word my hopes
[1:36:17] is built on the quickening of the word
[1:36:22] tongues interpretation shouting and
[1:36:25] glory hallelujah and great signs and
[1:36:27] wonders are all part of the Word of God
[1:36:29] and we don't want to do away with any of
[1:36:32] it but the new birth the born to get
[1:36:38] experience what did Jesus tell Nicodemus
[1:36:41] come on brothers what did Jesus tell
[1:36:43] Nicodemus his first doctrine was what
[1:36:45] you must be born again what did Jesus
[1:36:47] tell Nicodemus is the Nicodemus you got
[1:36:49] to be born from above that's original

[1:40:39] you know the stories I was expressing
[1:40:41] the other day where that brother Branham
[1:40:43] was talking about the man that picked up
[1:40:47] the track no it's alright pick up the
[1:40:50] track and said where will you spend
[1:40:53] eternity he said right there he started
[1:40:58] searching for God he went to the or I
[1:41:01] went to Billy Graham he went to the
[1:41:02] Pentecost he went to the GNAT he went to
[1:41:04] every one of them
[1:41:05] he said never got it they finally told
[1:41:07] him said you need to go to William
[1:41:08] Branham and said he's a prophet said he
[1:41:11] can be able to go through it you know
[1:41:13] what brother Branham said he said you
[1:41:16] don't need for me to pray for you he
[1:41:21] said you need to believe the word he
[1:41:29] said you remember when you picked up the
[1:41:31] track did you
[1:41:35] he said you turned around right doc he
[1:41:42] said you turned around and started in
[1:41:44] another direction
[1:41:54] he said sir you didn't have to sell your
[1:41:58] cars to give the minister's you didn't
[1:42:01] have to do that
[1:42:02] I said you already received Christ he
[1:42:10] said brother branham this is message
[1:42:11] thirsting for life he said brother
[1:42:14] Branham did I receive him when I spoke
[1:42:17] with tongues cuz he said he done all
[1:42:20] these times are shouted or when I raised
[1:42:26] up my hands I said neither one you
[1:42:32] received him when he knocked at your
[1:42:36] door what changed you what made the
[1:42:43] difference
[1:42:44] you were going down a road one way not
[1:42:49] caring for God I said shouting all right
[1:42:53] raising up your hands is all right
[1:42:55] speaking in tongues is all right they're
[1:42:58] all all right
[1:42:59] but it's not all the truth to receive
[1:43:03] Christ is to receive the person of
[1:43:06] Christ to receive Christ in the shout in
[1:43:10] the speaking in the tongues and all
[1:43:11] takes place he said you mean I had it
[1:43:16] all the time
[1:43:26] what about it
[1:43:29] there's about five or six messages that
[1:43:33] bread around and explains that man you
[1:43:36] were to read all of them because he goes
[1:43:39] in two confessions enzymes and what is
[1:43:45] it what happened to the man the man got
[1:43:53] a revelation from God because he says
[1:43:58] I've got to do something about this I've
[1:44:01] been 40 years and I've got to do
[1:44:04] something about it but around said he
[1:44:07] turned around started the other way he
[1:44:11] said dar was your conversion all these
[1:44:16] other things are fine he said but he
[1:44:22] said your conversion is when you
[1:44:24] accepted him right dark well you seem to
[1:44:38] be making him brother Taylor this is a
[1:44:39] revelation
[1:44:40] I didn't brother Brennan did you seem to
[1:44:43] be saying that it was something that the
[1:44:45] man should have known all the time that
[1:44:48] he had it he should have cause he had it
[1:44:51] your prophet said he did now you argue
[1:44:53] with him well he had to go through this
[1:44:56] he had to go through that head he made a
[1:44:58] pretty good point of going through a lot
[1:45:00] of things if you want to top this with
[1:45:02] that in the other cuz he started out
[1:45:03] believing he started into fountain he
[1:45:09] started into speaking in tongues he
[1:45:11] started in to going to the prophets he
[1:45:14] started into the basis of giving away a
[1:45:16] half a million dollars to the preachers
[1:45:19] to try to find an answer that's what he
[1:45:23] says
[1:45:24] read around and said you just needed to
[1:45:28] believe the word what about it do we
[1:45:34] believe the word
[1:45:36] yes but brother tail you're doing away
[1:45:38] with my experience so that's all I've
[1:45:40] ever had
[1:45:40] he's I've had this feeling that I said
[1:45:42] it would things were that ain't doing
[1:45:43] away with nothing
[1:45:45] I'm trying to tell you that could be but
[1:45:49] it's not your experience brother Brennan
[1:45:53] said one of the mysteries was receiving
[1:45:57] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:46:00] a sensation now how many more tapes and
[1:46:02] books do you want me to pull off with my
[1:46:04] desk looking at the papers where brother
[1:46:06] Brennan said you've got to have a
[1:46:07] sensation
[1:46:08] he said if you get the new birth you go
[1:46:11] to have a sensation now what's he saying
[1:46:15] without a sensation without some kind of
[1:46:19] a something like that but let it be what
[1:46:21] God wants you to do let him be to you
[1:46:27] what God wants him to be father we thank
