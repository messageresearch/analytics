Description:
2) REVELATION 22:19
»     19     †     And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

3) 63-0116  THE.EVENING.MESSENGER_  MESA.AZ  V-8 N-5  WEDNESDAY_
«  81       †          This is repeated each time through the Bible. We find that in the sacred Scriptures, all the way through, that just at the ending of the old age and the new one coming in, that age fades out and a new age comes in, God sends the messenger.
82    And as always--always, every time that a messenger comes, it's always a call back to the Word, never fails. Remember, This is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ, there cannot be nothing added to It or taken from It. It's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. And the only way that we can ever be sure: if anything rises among us that's contrary to this revelation, then it's wrong. See? It's "Back to the Word!" and always calling back.




4) 63-0117  AWAKENING.JESUS_  TEMPE.AZ  THURSDAY_
«  47       †          Well, that was the same basis that God did. God told Jeremiah, "Hananiah has lied. I never told him that." See, it's contrary to His Word. "And he'll be off the earth within a year." In the seventh month he died. He took him off the earth. Now, you see, although he was inspired, but it was contrary to the Word.
48    No matter how forceful a preacher can preach, how well he can make it look, if it's contrary to the Word, leave away from it. Stay away from it, clear.
49    It's the Word. That's God's program, the complete revelation of what He was, what He is, and what He will be. It's a continual revelation of Jesus Christ. And a complete revelation of Jesus Christ, is this Bible. Anything revealed contrary of Him, telling what He would do, what He is now, "Oh, that was in days past," don't you believe it. It's got to be the same Jesus, see, and that's the Word, now.

you know and yeah we got we got the message all right so just uh you know that's just that's it you know you know out the way do you get sick to pray that's the best thing to pray before you get sick and ask God to do it so let's just do that we'll get into our scriptures and first Peter and revelations but let's pray it that way and pray as a church to bind this enemy of Satan that's going from one to the other and the sicknesses and flu bugs and things like that and just ask God to take care of us okay father we know that we Lord can depend upon you and as we said we don't have to wait we get sick to pray for you to come on the scene you're on the scene already so we ask you to just bind the forces of the enemy that's come against our church Lord and the people of the church and the things and we ask you to just reach down and touch each one and put the blood over all of us Lord and just cover us as the bride of Jesus Christ around the world and all the things from the enemy and

right we love you and we thank you in Jesus name if you'd like turning your scriptures first Peter one and then we'll go to revelations one two now we are starting a ton of a like a it'll be a series that we've got into at the revelation of Jesus Christ or kind of be the title this is already the third message and we're going to get into the Book of Revelations and the ages and the things and we were to you know study those things there is a book that I recommend it I haven't read every page to assure everything but I've read a lot of it and I agree with the layout of the book and how it is because it it gives you like the studying of a church age and then it'll give you questions and answers and you can write it in and do things like that and there is a book we can get it it's been available for quite a while but if any of you want it make sure you let brother Joe know that you want a copy of this it's a commentary like thing who's it put out by yeah brothers from up in Jeffersonville their brother Joe and them knows and like I said now how it read it all but I read enough of it to know that I agree with it's a good good presentation and a good opportunity to study and everything is kind of put for the children so that makes it real good for them and so if you want one now contact brother Joe let him know and then we'll order the book and you know that the it's a church age study guide that's what it's actually called so if you want one we'll be glad to to buy them for the church and things and appreciate it okay first Peter now we'll be reading this scripture because let's see what yeah we've done announced to watch night services there'll be no service on December the 30th that's the only cancellation now we'll be full services this coming weekend all right there won't be the only service this canceled is the one on December the 30th because of coming over for the Monday night all right and having the service for the watch night and going through and all that even we will not cancel the first of the year we're not cancelling just that one service right everybody got it December the 30th which is the Sunday service is cancelled because of going over into the Monday and the watch night service okay all right let's see I got my I got my scripture wrote down well let's go to first Peter 1 verse 7 that they're trying of your faith being much more precious than of gold at precious though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now remember how we covered it there's a difference in the peering difference in the coming alright he can appear right over here today heal the sick do all kind of things that's his appearing he can appear all over the world that's his appearing but his coming is only for one purpose now it's not coming because that he's coming to end all things no that's all that's all involved in he's coming for the bride alright so that's the the difference between the appearing and the coming of the Lord and having not seen you love in him though now you see him not yet believing and you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving what now the end of your faith what is the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should be thought that should follow now remember this is the I'm trying to get you to look at it cuz we're gonna talk about the entire Bible alright so this is going back into that now alright unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves now see they saw things back dark but not clearly they couldn't figure it out exactly but they knew something was taking place but they knew then that if it was not taking place to them right then it was for someone else right unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ all right now so we're just approaching the church ages so let's read again what we did from revelations one it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written dar in for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word no we've spent two services already trying to lay a background into what we want to do as I said we will start we're gonna cover it real slow but we will start with the church ages so if you want to read your church age book if there's a good opportunity I love the reading and I love to read the church age book I do to me it's a marvelous piece of equipment and all and you know I love to read it because you'll see more and a little bit I hope why that it's like it is it's marvelous it's placed exactly ending up of all things all right but now what's been our thought brother branham said I gave you the quote our Sunday or life service that God was saying now John before I tell you anything I want you to know who I am right now he said before I tell you anything others before I start any part about the showing the church ages or anything I want you to know who I am alright so we went through that a couple of services to make sure that we understood following the truth of one true and living God and I hope that was a help to you to understand about those things because you know in the writing of the Bible that's what we're going to be dealing with that today in the writing of the Bible it is to be the revelation of Jesus Christ right now it's not the revelation of of me are you that's second I don't know where the word to use secondary is a right word to use but that comes into being because of what the truth is the truth is that the Bible is to reveal one God well it is to bring into being the understanding of that God to us and you say yeah but is it says the revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John to give the angel and and then it just it just this confusing in my mind you know because how many people are they well if you get it in the right order like I've tried to bring it you'll see that it comes down to the right understanding all right brother branham in our lifes references we were referring to that the reason that it's apples didn't understand the Lord Jesus because he they were not you know they were not prophets for the word to come to at that time and they were not filled with the Holy Ghost at that time so they were human beings that were you know dwelling in that area I think we have a visitor back there with us maybe so but looking around us in new you face anyhow if it is we say welcome to you all right no but now if the Bible and we're talking about the Bible if the Bible is what we have acclaimed it to be why not believe it to be sent to you and I and reveal to us and even to be able to read as it says in verse 3 that there's a blessing to just read it to just have the Bible to just be able to possess one is a great blessing because it is the ability then to be able to contact God but you can't contact him as in too many other ways and thoughts of mankind as intellectualism it must be that you you you see him by the revealing of himself unto you and I and remember now I've always said it I like this point may not mean nothing to you but this is my Bible no this is the way I believe it you know it was given to me I think this one was given to my brother Colley but I'm not certain to know I got one at was but this is my Bible you said well well I've got one too well all right that's your Bible that's not my Bible my Bible is my ability to contact God to hear from him and understand what he wants me to know all right and it belongs to me it was sent to me given to me all right see that way you can say well God gave me his word all right then you're not dealing with letters on the page you're dealing with something that you've actually possessed all right and being that way then the Bible is a is a wonderful book because it reveals the beginning it reveals what's taking place it reveals what will take place you know it's ever been revealed in the Bible all right that's a marvelous book to be able to cover 6,000 years of time all right but you know my my points always been this away cuz I'll get right straight to my thought me I believe the writing of the Bible is the most marvelous thing I remember now about two maybe six months six or eight months ago a year ago I spoke on this line but I want you to think on it to me there's never been a book that could ever fit in any way or in any comparison to the Bible because it's God's way of revealing himself to mankind but yet I love the way the Prophet said it one day he said even though the fall came and situations happened and all like that and the grapes in it problem he said you know God didn't stay up in heaven said he come down to live with us now that to me is marvelous that he come right down to this world to live with us and see then one of these days you're gonna find out at least I'll keep driving it until we can see it that the writing of the Bible is the writing of to you of the revelation of God to you personally but you know what it's so personal and so real until you're part of the word you are a part of see we take it that it writes about you know you can take the Bible and you can read it and you can say well this took place here and this took place here and that took place here and that's is you know reading through the Bible but remember that there was always people involved someone to make alive what he's written because if not why ride it you know I mean God before the world he could set back no the whole time he he knew the beginning from the end you know the whole thing before he ever even started but he didn't do it that way and he didn't come down and and try to force us in any way he come down and brought to you and I for whatever the day in time to be part of his word see when I read in the beginning God created heavens in the earth you know well you know what I read there I mean that's him telling me that in the beginning he created heavens in the earth that's why that's the creating of heavens and earth being described in letter form right you know that's that's the letter form of looking at the Bible well we'll see somebody had to make that alive right so there had to be if it was written there had to be an Abraham are you women and listening they had to be a people if God was going to send her deliverer down to Egypt they would have to be a deliverer sent to Egypt well so he would send Moses you know what Moses would run around said Moses was the alive word woman wait a minute now I don't see you don't don't take the wrong wording Moses was the word that God had spoken made alive in human flesh that walked upon the earth did that make Moses anything no it made him what God said he was he was a deliverer he was the one to come and bring the message all right the prophets brought the Bible and the truth come on the prophets wrote the Bible they come down through and they were riding it but somebody had to make that alive it wasn't just a bunch of men chosen well this man was chose to ride up to here and then this was chosen right here and this was till there was people making that alive a living word look at the Bible like that instead of just letters on the page or talking about a god look at it as that God as he's revealing himself through his word but you know then you're a part of that it's it's not that it's not that we just get the opportunity to read it what about a people that are living it now if he's Hebrews 13:8 as we have emphasized so much then he's the same yesterday today and forever so whatever he was in Genesis he's always been that and always will be that because he's the word all right but tip my thought now and we'll try to progress a little that see there's always been somebody to Michael I've the word of God because see it would not be the Bible first off if it wasn't the Word of God and - it wouldn't be the Bible if it wasn't not I mean if it wasn't the fact of being somebody to make that alive all right no you know I try to make a point or a thought to you to think over what has happened instead of us just reading about something else now that's why that we read that scripture see those prophets and things coming down they knew something was taking place they knew the spirit within them was moving them to a go certain way or to do a certain thing or to write a certain points all right and as they were doing that they knew something was transpiring we see that was that was Christ that's why the Prophet says it he said if you don't see Christ in ever verse he said go back and read it again he's because you missed it now you didn't say Jesus because you can't find Jesus in every verse but you can find the Christ the anointing are the anointed has to be that well I and see then it took all of those a prophet brought it out from masterpiece or you know going like that you know masterpiece good one he said Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and he said now that was the foundation huh then he said and then the prophets built the body what other words the prophets wrote the Bible they built the body the writing of the Bible was the building of the body of Jesus Christ not physically now come on it was getting things in order to work that it could transpire see then the lice was John the Baptist who come to introduce the Messiah all right see then the Messiah walked out God in human flesh according to John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right see then that that means that the Bible was not just dead letters even those prophets they knew something you know they knew something was motivating them to go certain ways and and to do and those prophets would go in and do things like you've heard the Prophet sit this way said what do you think that did I say I thought about such a virgin shall conceive well he knew physically he knew everything in the natural rim he knew everything as far as humanly speaking was totally contrary to what he just said we knew something was motivating him to say that what was motivating him to say that was the fact that one day that would come into a reality to be made flesh and a baby would be born right see those people were more back there and I know what you think did what we think about we think oh they just people they just done is a they were people that are living is the Word of God they were the alive word for the time can you follow that line see then if you can then you can follow it own crew and see that the Lord Jesus Christ came and walked upon this earth those prophets brought that book you know not they didn't have to write it some of them didn't even write some of them others had to write the different things right it's not to just say well that wrote this or they wrote know some of the other times I mean some some of them couldn't write at all somebody else had to write it all right but see when it was finished God stepped in to human flesh cause the Lord Jesus Christ all right and as he did he became the word made alive and the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ so he became what was spoken became a reality all right I told you we're we're approaching some things that I said I'm gonna lay in a few things it's going to be uh you know you're gonna have to think a little there's a lot of gaps in the Bible that needs to be filled up in the breaches coughs you know there's gaps there well I see there's like a gap between the book of Acts there's a gap between Calvary in the book of Acts the Lord Jesus had to come fulfilled and do all he had to do there's a gap between the book of Acts and then the church age is starting then there's a gap between the church ages see and the age is coming themselves and that has to be made a reality all right see my point is do we look at the Bible as some kind of a book that has been written to speak of God to speak of his ways and doun and say do we look at it like that or do we look at it as it being written now according to Paul Paul says you are written epistles well now I written epistle if you're gonna make plain sense out of it it means something got roped I mean is that southern something took place and see you are written epistle there's something in your life that is to display where your out comes now listen see we we look at the bow Lissette as this like some kind of a book we'll remember that book is still being written what about that that book is still in the place stages or phases of being written because there's things that have not been my life yet right there's things in the Bible that it's future tense that has not transpired see and we're in see the writing of the Bible we're in that basis of of it being brought in to something that people can read come on you sisters going out on the street and walking down the road with your long hair you dresses and your clothes and the things being correctly in order according to the word you realize that you're a Bible walking you realize they're gonna you're gonna be used as a judgement um at the judgment you V Stander's you know and people will look at what they see and they'll be judged by that GRU are you following me see we think about the Bible or the Bible that was wrote 2,000 years ago that's what I want you to get the Old Testament was brought to a close as the writing of what would transpire and John would come into being yin and the things would happen and introduce the Messiah and that was the finishing up of the Old Testament the writing of the Old Testament was brought to a close because there stood the god of the Old Testament in human flesh that's what brought it to a close that's why the Bible said it since Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe you said with a lolly in about now Christ is the end of the law if you're not in Christ you're still under the law now that's what people don't like if you're not a born-again believer tonight the law is still in existence and will condemn us you don't have to have a another book to bring up you don't have to bring up your daily life to condemn you judgment he just brings up the fact what you do with the law because the law is still in existence no no brother Dale we've been told all of our yeah we've been told all of our life that the law ended there no it didn't end there it only ends when you're born again if you're not born again you're still under the law I don't care who we are let's see if we don't want it that away we think it's some kind of a book that was written I'm talking about something taking place even now do you realize if there's a day a time a movement of the clock that means that reality is taking place among us you know life and God is still riding see that's what I want you to think about for a minute when John was on patent Asst he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and he was told to write he was told now writing sin to the seven churches well you know what those seven churches were in existence at that time those seven cities that were used to be able to lay each with the Church agent and break it down at Ephesus and Smyrna etc etc right and if that's true and we're living in lay do say then we're not finished yet so you'll find this as we go through the ages and times we talk about what would be called the dark ages of time you know for about a thousand years back there that in the tyrant church age right through that area third fourth and coming in we talk about that as being a horrible - but you know what that was what the word said was gonna take place just as much as Moses was going to go to Egypt that was going to be a persecution a things happened and it was written before it ever happened but as I said while ago now you kind of shook her head and agreed a little or smiled anyway Justin had you know that Moses was the alive word that had been spoken you know that they would be a deliverer come down and they'd be there for so many years and they they'd be this way and they'd be that way and then Moses would would come forth and they'd be delivered and all I can well why not bring that reality over to where we're living right now and it might change our thinking about a lot of things but brother Dale you sound like you're talking about the Bible still being written that's exactly what I'm doing because John on Patmos was told to write what he saw you know what he saw he saw what was taking place he saw what would be he saw what his age would be right and at least to say that we are in the lady of cien age as far as physically speaking then God is still riding or else one with Paul call us written epistles he said known in read of all man people can see you they they know you they know what you stand for they know what you're doing that's why it's so important to be that and then not be wishy-washy to be this today and then tomorrow and then we in and out and we you know own up and down no it's to be the same always to walk in Christ and let the world see Christ you realize what people are going to be judged by you realize you're going to be there we'll get back to that when we get into the to the Sevenfold glories and the different things and the judgment and how the the things that you realize people are gonna be judged by alive people you are gonna sit on the throne with Jesus Christ and judge the world you've been taught that haven't you to know that much that you'll be judged and see there won't be no argument because you'll be sitting there and god of this simpler did you testify yeah did you live this do you do that yeah well then they won't be no argument because it's still being written see the white throne hadn't come into existence yet right the judge switching the thing it hasn't come into existence that's what I'm trying to get you to see there's things in the Bible that has not come into reality we're living that reality this is a living word this is not dead letters on the page it's God living in his people manifested himself revealing himself showing himself to the world no wonder it's gonna be a horrible time into judgment because he won't be able to hide her own selves or nothing that's why I want to make sure that we've got it all covered before we get that right but do you see the reality see the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ all right now in that point Matthew says upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it right all right so now there's no way to stop the church from coming into reality because it's promised now if the point is if we're part of that we're in good shape but if not we're just reading somebody else's mail right we read somebody else's book instead of seeing ourselves instead of seeing who we are and what's taking place we're just reading to watch somebody else says all right so when John comes to to bring the the word in other words writing it's an amazing thing that God says the revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John what now listen we believe in that one true and living God truly okay but remember now in the way that we believe in one true and living God has got to be as I've tried to express with this last few messages that if we don't see God as real and see how he reveals himself how are we gonna know anything about our ourselves and the Bible says that even the eternal Godhead can be revealed or made known by the things that we see so here comes a little profit along trying to explain one God right I mean the theologians has got to theophanies and I guess the ticket brought around sometimes he called it the octopus and he'll have all kind of words for that totally like the rest of us you know no education but though stielow's is trying to explain that and they know they can't do it but he says it's very simple he said there's not three gods he said that's hedonism well boy that's that throwed it right there didn't it cuz I'll realize we've taught hedonism you know we swore by it we fought for it we argued about it they've got to be three hmm what you see the Prophet would make a simple illustration he said I'm a father he said I'm a human I'm a being I'm a person he could give any kind of layouts like it he said but how many are they of me he said I have many manifestations we said I'm only one person they don't theologian going goodness what is this carnality of this man and his idiotic ways of trying to express God that simple and their God was using a man to speak the revelation that had been locked away from mankind all the way through and see very was in simplicity expressing the word he says it now there's not three of me he said then I'm a human being I'm a person and he said and that's the way god he is he said God came down to dwell with us to reveal himself to us and said there he is said he's my father he's been here he's a savior he's now but said how many are the oven he just is simple talking it and then what theologians sitting there saying where did this guy get all of this idiotic thoughts from and he turns around he said okay now let's just solve the problem yeah he says now all of this talk about we can talk about God and and describe him and do all these things but said you know what one word from him is worth more than all that we could talk about he said now if he's real and I've talked the truth said let him come on the scene and he said now here stands a blind man you know you know he was over in foreign countries when he done it but he was doing it every day in front of the congregation he said now if if what I've taught is true then God will heal this man and said if he don't then you don't have to believe nothing and said now let's just see if he'll come honestly but said before I do said why don't y'all come up here and take your theological terms in order and its brain God on the scene so let's see what's onedrive right and here's a little old man had no education whatsoever but yet God would come on the scene and heal the sick raise the dead cast out Devils all kind of things and all that theologians could do was just stand there look I mean I don't admire a lot of them because you know what they said oh we're gonna that member the man the picture wizard listen to it the other day you know man I'm gonna tire his hide and all that and he said God won't allow that to happen simple words brought God on the scene alive before mankind now then the Bible was being written because it said this would take place you'll turn the hearts of the children in the faith of us etc it was the writing of the word melech high for luke 1730 revelation 2:10 7 all of those scriptures that we talked about they become into a reality living before mankind and showing a real God and God was still rotten man kind of done stopped and done forgot it so you say to people when was the Bible written oh it was written back oh it was written 2,000 years ago what that might be true but then ask him is he still riding no no no no he quit writing he quit writing well when did he quit writing if you were reading a pistol when did he quit writing and as long as something is not in full manifestation is he not still writing because else you're reading histories in thing and you're really reading prophecies is what you're doing because you're reading it looking to the future but you know God doesn't do that every day it's alive to him one other it be alive to you and I and seeing baby we might be able to catch on one day about the Bible and what it really is I believe the Bible is the Word of God all right but I believe if that word of God no become Satan it because I'm firm believing in it I believe the Bible is the Word of God and the fact of it being the Word of God there's no way Satan can attack that and destroy it he can't destroy it because he can't he can't destroy the kingdom that's what Jesus what it was being said see upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail you mean there's some word that Satan's gonna prevail over the Bride of Christ no we'll put a down the shore don't look too good what does that got to do with it see that's the way we look at it we look at it like the the children of Israel down in Egypt and they're being beaten and they're being this that and they're getting worse and worse and the taskmasters is making it worse and worse and they're oh what I cried Lord we thought she was gonna do something worrying that and everyday he had a man out in the desert getting him ready right the very time they were crying and wonder what was going on he's getting everything ready let's see we don't look at it like that we want to see him come on the scene hey that's good that's all well and good but why can't we get it to the basin to see he's already on the scene he ain't laughed even when I was a trinitarian colorize with the rest of us and all of us are you know has it even as a finitary and they'd say well we won't tell you they've taken Christ out of Christmas and they never did take Christ out of Christmas they've laid it took Christ out of Christmas they'd had mass I have enough sense to be able to read you take Christ out of Christmas and what do you got mass see and we had him as a trinitarian still believed he was right you didn't have to restore Christ about a Christmas tree or anything but when does God stop riding he'll stop riding when the times when it time and let's see what we return in Revelation is one the time is at hand when the time is finished God will start riding when all of this is over with and we step into eternity he'll stop riding that's that's what I've tried my best to get get you to see I know I'm carnal sorry I think carnal but you see we say what was the last creation well God created man in the garden and he quit creating I defy that on the basis of God's Word that's a lot why because according to revelation 3:14 Jesus is the beginning of the creation that was just the beginning of what God wanted the rest of it was natural mankind and you are what the prophets say he said he's the beginning of the creation he said and we are the continuation of that creation so ever time a born-again believer comes into the body of Christ God is creating he's creating his family why don't we think like that sometimes his family is being created that's why I like the way we talk you know they would go to here we go to mom and dad in then we go to kids then go to grandkids and then go great-great grandkids great guy great girl great Gregory Gregory Gregory we never stop right see if people say my ancestors came over on the Mayflower you know well you know what they peed somebody's did you could what I mean mom and daddy thank you it never stops that's why war is so horrible because war takes out in in generations that will never come forth killing incinerations that's what Satan wants to do but he can't stop the kingdom of God because there's no ending of this generation our generation is we call it and as long as God is birthing children into his kingdom you know by the new birth then God is still writing the Bible is still being written come on that's the approach I'm trying to make it where you were looking to book of revelations then when you do you'll be able to one day to see that hey we can go through the first church age and see what took place take the second turkey eggs and lay it right in order and see what took place and go through the church ages and when they do you come out to where you're at then you realize he's not over he's just beginning he's not gonna stop the Prophet said God will give us the message of tear down to the endless ages after time is over with you realize these parts of the Bible it's not going to be totally fulfilled here it will be there because it's prophesying speaking when we enter that future home you're just beginning no no we're good we'll see that's what the corn ality is nothing in God ever comes to an end right so he still run you realize that in the Bible that spoke of the towers when they'd fall the Scripture speaks of it we don't want to had to be a day that took place all right had to be a kingdom of the Greeks and the Romans and the the different things because it had been written we'll see why can't we think when God said I'll be with you always can he ever turn away from me we turn away from him right we know that we do that definitely but he can't turn away from us cuz he said it yeah but I thought the Bible was written yeah that's right do you think it was written back time it was written to say what would take place in the ages now come on I'm getting it and I'll quit this away and see Jesus when he was here on earth they would ask in him about when he was coming and he said I don't know he said the father hasn't revealed that yet to me right the brother Owen said when he come to John on Patmos God had revealed it all right so he would write about his coming he would write what could not be written back there but he would write it in stages don't know where the ages stages times whatever he wrote about what would take place he wrote about himself to be living in the ages that's what he's still riding well we've had we've had a Bible long time here and there it was they wrote 2,000 years ago that's well good really it was written for the foundation world I mean going back up okay we back away up what the point is there has to be you don't forget this now did we get their next message there has to be a people to make a live the word or it's not the word why say it there's got to be a people to make a live the word of God and it is then your written epistles and as your written epistles then he's finishing his writing in you what we think of the Bible like that see we think it was wrote thousands of years ago but there's things in there that hasn't been fulfilled well that's just a prophecy to come prophecies have to be fulfilled or else they're not true prophecies there had to be a Moses go to Egypt or that was the wrong prophecy are you with me I'm just trying to get you to see the reality of a Christian life the simpler reality of a Christian life we can put ourselves out of the picture or we can bring ourselves into the picture well I just don't understand what brother Dale talked he sounds like he's talking about God's up our now rotting well why not are you down you're living it I like what one brother told us one time it's just brother he had you know then it was a story but I believe it anyhow the brother had went to a meeting or something was going and and brother branham spoke to that brother and said brother he said you had to fight your way here you've heard it said probably the brother he said somebody asked him later said did you experience anything different you know going that day said no I just got in the car Lent but you see that's what he saw he didn't see all of the situation that existed behind it that no telling how many of car wrecks no telling how many bad things could have taken place on the way and was diverted around it and took play to get that person dire I'm gonna take what the Prophet said if that's true what he said that he saw things he saw that how horrible it was to get there they don't think much about it you've heard your prophet said in other words you going down the highway and all at once you make a turn you go well why did that turn off what road then I have to while you get on the radio find out it was a bad wreck on that road that she was on you know God can take care of us or listen to him sometime you've heard the story the Prophet telling about it was listen other not to him but to the guy you know that was riding a horse and the horse wanted to go one way and he wanted to go the other and he finally let the horse out of the way and they plunge right into a river you know they we want to try to make God be our way oh yeah oh yeah I'm a child of God so I'm supposed to be where is it to be said to the child garnish is to be put to a basis that they're there not to be sick because come on many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord lead us out of them all now we don't glory in that and say we've got to be sick because we're Christians no we don't go that away we know and realized the fact that we're in a world I walk to the door yesterday and my niece came over about some flowers and I told her I said I'll go getting any letter come I said you don't need to probably come in I said well we're fighting the flu bug around here she looked at me in lies she said I ain't afraid of no flu bug she just pipes right on well you know what she won't she won't get the bug as quick as somebody oh yeah I'm scared of it I'm not going to no no no no cuz she's just stubborn enough she said I'm not worried about no flu bug well that was just a a I call her just plain old sinner and they could be that away but you see we think well why are we so sick well how are we having so many troubles now may I quote brother branham he said Satan can not come after you unless God removes the veil what he said now does that mean we can't get a bad cold no no goes into deeper gram dry but that's what I said to start with why can't we pray and believe and say Lord take care of us cover us by the blood keep us covered from all of these things that are around the world because we're here we're living here come on musicians we're living here see I'm trying my best to get you to see one thing and then we'll finish this message like what that the Bible is not complete yet it's not finished because we're still here he's still rotting and every time a king a child of God is born into the kingdom he's still rotting why because the Bible is the Word of God and you are the Word of God you're a living epistle the world is going to be judged by you because you are his word God's not through and if he's not true I might want to say this but I'm gonna say it anyway get in trouble with it I stand gently do you know if the Bible is set and stamped - then ain't nothing we can do but just do what it says is that the way you think it said that's it Bible says gonna be that way is that the way God does it it would be if he'd already wrote it but what if he ain't wrote it yet just remember there was a man in the Bible one time that God sent him word that he was going to pass set your house in order cause you're gonna die man cried out before God he said Lord I need to get my house in order I think we know the whole story we'd like to get into all of the badge angles out of it don't we he should have just went ahead and died because he wound up sending more to start with well that's the things we want to hear we don't want to hear the truth did that did God change his mind your prophet said he did not he said God don't change his mind well yeah we know he knew what he was gonna do that's right cuz he knew the man was gonna ask for your dead that's the written word to me when I look at the Bible I look at that man crying out before God and I look at it as God hasn't finished this story yet so he says you got 15 more years he's gonna die anyway you know we know that huh see we think that's the story well the Prophet said God didn't change his mind within it and had never been stamped where he was gonna die it had never been told him you're gonna die in ten days from now and things of this that that's Oakland hot right that was not written it was just written you're going to die yeah but you're making good no I ain't making God change his mind I'm letting him walk right through life and see what me and you the bigger ones just messing it all up he just gives that man the time knowing what he's gonna do in every way but the thing then the thing for me can't say why did you for me because he didn't do it he gave him a choice 15 more years or dying right now he said give me the 15 years he wasn't through riding I hope that's things in it might answer a question did God change his mind no he just laid the choices out and let the man choose what he wanted because he knew what the choice would be one of these days I'll explain predestination enough to understand we think everything is stamped that's it what if he gives you a choice oh but he knows the truck Hey we're not we're not into the finality z-- we're into the writing of the book until the book is written you and I have our opportunities that's damn we'll hit rather what we got Heavenly Father 5:40 anybody have a need [Music] Heavenly Father i apprec [Music] I'm forgetting their choice [Music] we're getting me an opportunity [Music] for being in the writing of the book instead of the stamp out book written dead anybody have a need you had never heard running around and say you can pray for God to change his mind your listen to the message code of he ain't that bad [Music] mother down don't agree with you that's wonderful not the fact you don't agree with him it's wonderful that we're all human being I love you I bow down before you Heavenly Father i apprec all this spirit you're a comedy a Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me you leave me you got me your dwelling inside me Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me a Heavenly Father i apprec [Music] Heavenly Father [Music] you oh then we won't know where to go I love you [Music] before you Heavenly Father we condemn this demon that's bothering her brother physically and skirt release because he's doing everything to attack the human mind that he can running his blood pressure up and down and all kind of thing one day looking good one day no [Music] we know the books not written about this case yet become our brothers still standing here as long as he's standing here in live with the Endon to believe to be able to say thank you Lord so we just commit it to you we have nothing that we can do we could do it we do it born yet we can believe you thank you lord for your word thank you that it's not fully written yet so there's still pages

anybody else a man just prayed I got some Lord Jesus our brothers got knee problems how much we can sympathize with him trying to work trying to do and go and we just ask your father to reach down and take that away from me we condemn it under the blood of Jesus Christ and Lord we give it to you because we try to do everything we could but we can't so we lay it in your hands father believe in you and by your stripes he's healed [Music] anybody else [Music] so you think about God as real alive and things still here and he's still right that's the purpose of what I've tried to get you to see the books not finished [Music] see we're the one that's finished the book we're the ones that closes the pages we're the ones that says there's no product no hopes know that God doesn't say nothing like that [Music] just thank God for his word father we thank you we've tried to express Lord what's in our heart about your word and the Lord's you're still writing and as long as you're writing then everything's okay and it comes to you say finally it is finished it'll all be done but until that day we can believe that all things are possible to them that believe that we can ask you to God and to happen to be with these that are sick and afflictions and things and father believe you that you'll touch each one go with us now as we go into natural meal bring us back together in your loving grace you would wait this afternoon Lord as he ministers them to us and just bless him in your grace we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you dismiss [Music] you
