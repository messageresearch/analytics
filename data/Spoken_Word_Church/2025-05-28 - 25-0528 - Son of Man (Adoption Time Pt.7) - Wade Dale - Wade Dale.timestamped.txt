[0:00] that he doesn't
[0:01] change. He wrote it right the first time
[0:05] and didn't need to rewrite it. Man has
[0:09] tried to rewrite it in their mind the
[0:12] way they think God wanted it written.
[0:14] But this is the word of God vindicated.
[0:18] You know why it's vindicated? I don't
[0:20] need a vindication from somebody else. I
[0:22] I have a vindication that this word made
[0:25] me live made me alive. It gave me
[0:27] eternal life. And that's what we look to
[0:30] tonight. We'll, if you want to, you can
[0:32] turn your Bibles into the book of
[0:34] Romans. And thank you all for your
[0:36] prayers today. There was uh nothing
[0:38] going on in my stomach. And like I said
[0:40] before, the he expanded
[0:44] my my esophagus is, you know, like two
[0:47] hours worth of sermons now. So I can
[0:50] handle that. The doctor said Terrence
[0:53] said he was going to go with me and make
[0:54] sure they only put a 45minute one in. So
[0:58] he didn't
[1:00] go. Praise the Lord. Jim went. So, but
[1:03] just keep remembrance in prayer that
[1:06] everything else will turn out all right.
[1:08] We're still having some uh problems with
[1:10] our blood pressure. And I just don't
[1:13] know why I guess it's y'all. Romans
[1:17] 8:15. Let's bow our heads and talk to
[1:19] the altar. Dear heavenly father, thank
[1:21] you for this day, Lord. Thank you for
[1:22] the purchase of your blood.
[1:25] You gave us an opportunity of
[1:29] salvation. Lord, you also gave us an
[1:32] opportunity for a continued walk and
[1:36] promises that we have sometimes we we
[1:40] stop short of those promises, Lord. But
[1:44] may you, Lord, remind us of all the
[1:47] promises you gave us in the Bible from
[1:49] the book of Genesis all the way to the
[1:50] book of Revelations. You gave us
[1:52] promises. You gave us promises of end
[1:55] time that things were going to happen
[1:57] and and that God would send people Lord
[2:00] among us that would preach the word of
[2:02] God and and we could listen to it and
[2:04] then say that's not nothing but the
[2:06] truth. It'll resonate from the Holy
[2:09] Spirit that's inside of us. Father, I
[2:11] pray that you'd be with us now as we
[2:13] continue this thought. Lord, that you'll
[2:15] help each one forgive us of our sins. Be
[2:17] with the ones that are not here that are
[2:19] traveling. Bring them back home safe,
[2:21] Father. I know, brother John, different
[2:22] ones are leaving in a week or so,
[2:25] Father. I pray that you'd be with him.
[2:26] Keep your mighty hand upon them as they
[2:28] take their journey, Lord, to different
[2:30] places and and do his job. It's for his
[2:33] job, Lord. But I pray, Lord, that you'd
[2:34] just keep your mighty hand upon him and
[2:36] bless them in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[2:40] Romans
[2:41] 8:15, for ye have not received the
[2:44] spirit of bondage again to fear. So
[2:46] there's nothing fearful in Christianity.
[2:50] Nothing nothing should make you afraid.
[2:54] Because it it becomes a bondage.
[2:57] It binds you. All right. But you have
[3:00] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[3:03] we cry of a father. The spirit itself
[3:07] bearing witness with our spirit that we
[3:10] are the children of God. And if we're
[3:12] children of God, what are we? We're
[3:15] hes joints with Christ. That means what
[3:19] Christ gets, we get.
[3:22] Come on.
[3:24] If so be that we suffer with him, that
[3:27] we may also be glorified together. For I
[3:30] reckon that the sufferings of this
[3:32] present time, it's in red letter. I'm
[3:34] put a red letter of this present time
[3:37] are not worthy to be compared with the
[3:39] glory which shall be revealed in flesh
[3:43] on the earth in a bride. Amen. Jesus's
[3:47] body is not coming back here until the
[3:49] millennium. So his body is the body of
[3:51] believers, the body of Christians, the
[3:53] body of Christ around the world. That
[3:56] makes up his body. And we are what? Bone
[3:58] of his bone, flesh of his flesh, word of
[4:01] his word. Everybody with me. All right.
[4:03] You may be seated. the Lord add his
[4:04] blessing to the reading of the word. And
[4:05] we were looking at going back through
[4:08] the u the series there that Brother
[4:10] Brandon preached on adoption and and
[4:12] we're going to bring out something
[4:13] tonight. If we get to it, that'll be
[4:15] fine. And we will just uh uh finish up
[4:18] on Sunday. But I want you to see
[4:19] something why it's so important that we
[4:23] look now get me get we look past the new
[4:26] birth. Not not pass like pass by it, but
[4:30] receive it and then receive it and plus
[4:36] receive it and get the other promises of
[4:38] God. Cuz remember the promise of God is
[4:40] to give you the baptism of the Holy
[4:42] Ghost. For this promise is to you and
[4:44] your children, them that are far off and
[4:45] as man as the Lord our God shall call.
[4:47] So it's a promise to give you the Holy
[4:49] Ghost. But God also promised though that
[4:52] this spirit of adoption which is when
[4:55] you talk about adoption, you talk about
[4:57] growth, development or growing up in God
[4:59] or or we we believe as the Baptist
[5:02] believe once saved always saved. But but
[5:05] if you're saved the first time, right?
[5:08] Everybody with me? You can't get
[5:10] baptized as a kid and have a letter in a
[5:12] in a in a vault somewhere and don't
[5:14] never go to a church ever again and
[5:17] Yeah. Right. Anyway, that's not what God
[5:19] said. God said to walk with me, talk
[5:22] with me. I'll go inside of you and do my
[5:25] works through you. So then you are what?
[5:28] You are manifesting what God's done in
[5:31] your life. You're manifesting what your
[5:33] soul you're. You're going to manifest
[5:34] who you are anyway. You're going to
[5:36] manifest through your body is going to
[5:39] manifest what's in your soul. All right?
[5:42] Like Paul said, in the in the lust of
[5:44] the flesh and all the different things
[5:45] that we did back before we were born
[5:47] again, that was done because there was a
[5:49] motivator inside of me that was not of
[5:52] God.
[5:54] It was of the devil. It was an old
[5:56] nature that I was given because of the
[5:58] fall in the beginning that God said,
[6:00] "I'm going to put enmity between that.
[6:02] I'm not going to what? I'm not going to
[6:04] be where I can get into your soul when
[6:06] you're a
[6:07] baby, but I'm going to give you a
[6:10] promise that if you'll come to this
[6:12] realization and come to salvation, and
[6:14] we'll look at it in just a few minutes,
[6:16] you come to this great work of
[6:17] salvation, then I'll come in you and
[6:20] then let me do the work. Get out of the
[6:23] way.
[6:24] Don't be in the way of God.
[6:27] It's his will and his way.
[6:31] Jesus said, "Thy will be done." So what
[6:34] we say, "Thy will be done." We all have
[6:36] a garden experience. We should have one
[6:39] where we wrestle it out. We wrestle it
[6:42] out with the world pulling on this side
[6:43] and God pulling on this side and you're
[6:46] the one that decides it because you're
[6:47] the one that is a free moral agent that
[6:50] God's not going to override you and make
[6:52] you get saved.
[6:54] No, he's not that way.
[6:57] He said everyone that the father draws
[6:59] though I'll give him eternal life. So
[7:01] you hear that draw and you become
[7:03] eternal by in your soul. And that's what
[7:06] we're sitting here today in heavenly
[7:07] places. But God wants us to be more than
[7:11] just that.
[7:13] He don't want us to be just a good
[7:14] church goer come every once in a while
[7:16] and do every you know read every once in
[7:17] a while and and you know do these every
[7:20] once in a while things. He wants us to
[7:22] be what? Good stewards of his word. He
[7:25] gave us a plain Bible to read. He gave
[7:27] us a knowledge that even an illiterate
[7:31] person that can not read, if somebody
[7:33] read this to them, if they got enough
[7:34] God in them, they'll say that ain't
[7:36] nothing but the truth because it'll
[7:38] resonate with what's inside of them. All
[7:40] right. So, Ephesians 1:3, let's start
[7:42] right here. Now, remember this is the
[7:44] Ephesian church. I got back reading
[7:46] Ephesians the other day, the whole
[7:48] chapter. And man, it's just it's just to
[7:50] a mature group of people. is somebody
[7:53] that that Paul could talk about
[7:55] adoption. He could talk about
[7:56] predestination. He could talk about the
[7:58] will of God. And he could talk about
[8:01] being what? In heavenly places and doing
[8:03] all these things. And in the book of
[8:04] Ephesus, he could talk plain. But in the
[8:07] book of Corinthians, he had to correct
[8:09] them. Every time he'd go into the town,
[8:10] he'd have to correct them something.
[8:11] That's why the book of Corinthians is
[8:13] the book of what? Corrections. All
[8:15] right. It corrected every every time
[8:17] he'd go there. He'd have to set him
[8:18] down, brother Danny, and say, "All
[8:20] right, y'all got off right here." But he
[8:23] was a good
[8:25] pastor or evangelist or whatever he was.
[8:27] He was all the different offices. But
[8:29] Paul sat down and he would tell them,
[8:32] "You're this kind of person,
[8:34] but such were some of you, but you've
[8:36] been washed. You've been sanctified." So
[8:39] he gave them away to where that he just
[8:41] did. He condemned them, but he condemned
[8:43] them like Jesus with nail nail scarred
[8:45] hands, knowing that they were going to
[8:47] grow up in God if they continued on with
[8:49] God. So Ephesians 1:3, blessed be the
[8:53] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[8:55] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[8:57] blessings in heavenly places. All right?
[9:00] So heavenly places is what? the
[9:03] believer's position in
[9:04] Christ according as he hath chosen us in
[9:08] him when before the foundation of the
[9:10] world that we should be holy and without
[9:13] blame before him in love. Remember God
[9:16] will never change his mind.
[9:19] God can't change his mind. So if he
[9:22] loved you in the beginning, if he loved
[9:23] you before the foundation of the world,
[9:25] there's not a time when he unloved you.
[9:27] But now there's a time when you unloved
[9:29] him. Right?
[9:31] There's a time when you didn't care
[9:32] anything about going to church. You
[9:34] didn't care anything about listening
[9:35] about God or about this Jesus guy. Don't
[9:38] tell me about that. Amen. I know we can
[9:40] all pretty much unless we were born in a
[9:43] in a bubble, we can pretty much identify
[9:46] with that. There was a time that we had
[9:48] conversation, Paul said, in times past
[9:50] in the lust of the flesh and what of
[9:52] doing it.
[9:54] Paul said, "The things I would not, I
[9:56] do. The things I do, I would not."
[9:58] But in other words though we have an
[9:59] advocate that we can go and say God I'm
[10:02] sorry
[10:04] according as he hath chosen us where in
[10:07] him not of him. There are many people
[10:08] that are chosen of God. Listen Judas was
[10:12] chosen of God.
[10:16] Hello.
[10:18] Come follow me. Judas had part of the
[10:20] ministry. Judas held the money. Judas
[10:22] was a real popular guy. But he was never
[10:26] in
[10:27] Christ. He was thought of by Christ, but
[10:30] he never was in Christ or he wouldn't
[10:32] have done what he did.
[10:35] That we should be what? Holy and without
[10:37] blame before him in love. Oh, I can't do
[10:39] it. No, you cannot do it. But if you
[10:42] will get that God person inside of you,
[10:44] let him do it.
[10:47] Having predestinated us into the
[10:50] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[10:52] himself. Now remember this adoption is
[10:55] not like the adoption in the world. All
[10:59] right? Cuz we adopt and go through an
[11:02] adoption process and we adopt children
[11:04] or or girls or boys that are somebody
[11:07] else's that don't want them or the
[11:08] parents died or whatever situation it
[11:10] is. We adopt them by paperwork. We adopt
[11:13] them into the family which they were of
[11:16] another family. But now remember in the
[11:18] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[11:21] himself, the rule of adoption in the Old
[11:23] Testament was if you were born in the
[11:26] family, you were that son in that
[11:28] family. Remember the prodal son was a
[11:31] son of the father that loved him.
[11:37] Amen. So you and I once we get into the
[11:40] family of God, we come to the air part
[11:44] or where we can be adopted if we so
[11:47] continue on with God. Christianity is
[11:50] not a set on your rear thing.
[11:53] It's a moving God's in motion.
[11:55] Everything's in motion. The word of
[11:56] God's in motion every day. God's moving.
[11:59] He's moving on somebody in the world.
[12:03] We just got to be able to what? Listen
[12:04] to what he's saying. having
[12:07] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[12:09] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[12:13] according to the good pleasure of his
[12:14] will. Now remember Jesus never had any
[12:16] children
[12:18] physically. Jesus never had a child. I
[12:21] don't care what the stupid world says
[12:22] about it. He was pure and holy born
[12:25] virgin and he died on the cross a
[12:27] virgin. Everybody with me? So he could
[12:31] overcome all that. All right. Everybody
[12:34] with me? Amen. But now to be a child of
[12:36] God, then what have you got to do? You
[12:37] got to be adopted into you got to be in
[12:39] in by new birth to the family of God and
[12:41] then you come to where you're an heir of
[12:44] God and you get what Jesus had. It says
[12:46] right here, heirs and joint hes. That
[12:49] means what he gets, we get. All right?
[12:52] According to the good pleasure of his
[12:54] will. And what is his will? His will is
[12:55] his word. Tonight, you hold the will of
[12:58] God in your hand. Someone had to die to
[13:01] give you this will.
[13:03] Everybody with me? You don't read wills
[13:05] before they
[13:06] pass. So the death of the testator,
[13:09] Jesus Christ had to die to give us this
[13:12] will. So every time we open this book,
[13:14] it is the will that God has for his
[13:17] children.
[13:19] All right? And you got a choice whether
[13:21] to be his children or not.
[13:24] to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[13:26] not of ours. Wherein he hath made us
[13:31] accepted in
[13:32] him. I'm not changing that. Who is the
[13:36] beloved? He's the only beloved one. So
[13:39] made us accepted in Christ. Everybody
[13:42] with me? Now the prophet of God tells
[13:45] us, he said, look, Galatians 1 tells us
[13:47] that we were predestinated to the
[13:50] adoption of sons by Jesus Christ.
[13:52] predestinated of God. Now listen, though
[13:55] many are called, but few are chosen. All
[13:59] right? Now,
[14:00] scripture. Judas was called
[14:04] But he wasn't chosen to go on to the
[14:06] Holy Ghost. All right? The chosen was
[14:10] chose at the beginning. What? Before the
[14:14] foundation of the world.
[14:17] Now, but we were predestinated to the
[14:20] adoption of children of God by Jesus
[14:23] Christ. Him being omnipotent and knowing
[14:26] all things. He knew how many children he
[14:28] was going to have. You and I don't.
[14:31] We're we're we're human beings with a
[14:32] human mind that's finite, that's really
[14:35] narrow. But his mind is I know every kid
[14:39] I've ever I'm ever going to have because
[14:41] he never had them by a relationship with
[14:44] a woman. He had them by the spoken word
[14:46] in his brain. In his God, yeah, God's
[14:49] got a brain, right? Wait a minute.
[14:51] Sorry. God's a person. He's not a spook.
[14:54] Okay. So, he's got a mind. He's got
[14:55] eyes. He's got ears. Cuz remember in
[14:58] Genesis 1:26, Brother John, we were made
[15:01] in his image. So, what did Adam look
[15:02] like? Adam looked like a human being
[15:04] because God is a human being.
[15:07] Oh my. God's not something just floating
[15:09] around, folks. He's real. He's more real
[15:12] than you and I are because he made this
[15:13] whole thing.
[15:16] And what did he want us to do? He wants
[15:18] to bring sons to himself.
[15:21] And not just bring sons to himself, but
[15:23] he wants to nurture us, care for us,
[15:26] help us to grow, and then what? Trust
[15:30] us.
[15:32] He wants to trust us with the will that
[15:34] he's given us. Now watch. And today the
[15:38] church has gone on for year after year
[15:40] after year. And when we saw see God call
[15:43] a man out, one of his sons and
[15:45] positionally places him and makes him
[15:48] his son and recognizes it before the
[15:50] public. Then we turned that son down.
[15:52] Did they not turn Jesus Christ down? Who
[15:55] turned Jesus Christ down? The the
[15:58] sinner, the
[16:00] prostitute. Who turned him down? The
[16:03] religious world.
[16:05] The religion of the world is what put
[16:07] Jesus on the cross. You should know I
[16:08] did. Yes, we did. But they physically
[16:10] put him up there. Everybody with me. All
[16:13] right. So, it's the religious world.
[16:15] It's the religious world you got to
[16:17] watch out for every time.
[16:21] To make him this son and recognize it
[16:23] before the
[16:24] public. Then we turn that son down and
[16:27] say he's a divine healer or a holy
[16:29] roller. Don't you see where the church?
[16:31] Oh, I don't know what the remedy is. I
[16:33] don't know how it'll ever get back to
[16:35] its place. But that's the way our
[16:38] attitudes are toward that person. If the
[16:40] if the ministry is of God, now watch. If
[16:43] the ministry of is of God, God will
[16:45] vindicate that ministry. So, we've seen
[16:48] a ministry in the end time. God told us
[16:51] in Malachi 4 and 6 that he would send us
[16:53] Elijah the prophet to bring everything
[16:55] back together. Amen.
[16:58] and turn our hearts back to the original
[17:00] word of God, not to a Baptist or a
[17:02] Methodist or a Pentecostal and all those
[17:03] different denominations. God is not that
[17:06] confused.
[17:09] We are, but God's not that confused. If
[17:12] it isn't of God, then God will have
[17:14] nothing to do with it. All
[17:17] right. Adoption series. How can you
[17:21] preach predestination of God for
[17:23] ordaining and setting unless there's a
[17:26] sin atonement somewhere? So, you have to
[17:28] come to the sin atonement first.
[17:31] All right. I'm setting the stage here
[17:33] for something I want you to see that
[17:35] happened in the in in the Old Testament.
[17:38] Why is it each day you make a mistake,
[17:42] each day you do
[17:44] wrong? But if you're born again, man or
[17:47] woman, as soon as you make the mistake,
[17:50] God knows you're sorry for it. You can
[17:54] stand in the presence of President
[17:55] Roosevelt or anybody else and say, "I'm
[17:57] wrong. God, forgive me for this
[17:59] thing." So, you notice the Bible tells
[18:02] us that sins, a sinner is a sinner. He
[18:05] does not commit sins. He is a sinner.
[18:09] Being a sinner, he has all the sins on
[18:11] him. All right? But you and I being born
[18:14] again and still being connected to this
[18:16] old nature, we have
[18:18] sins. We sin every day. Anything
[18:21] contrary to God is a sin. All right? So
[18:24] that's why we have to say forgive me
[18:26] Lord about 250 times before lunch.
[18:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, pray for
[18:35] me. But the but the church commits sin,
[18:38] does wrong, gets a wrong thought, wrong
[18:40] impression, makes scruples, wobbles like
[18:43] a little child walking. Now remember,
[18:46] this is his
[18:48] child. This is his child.
[18:51] trying to learn how to walk. He just
[18:53] don't know how to walk good yet because
[18:55] he's a little boy. When you first get
[18:57] born again, you're what? A spirit-b born
[18:59] babe in Christ as Paul says, desiring
[19:02] what? The sincere milk of the word of
[19:03] God. All right? Cuz he's a little boy.
[19:07] You can't put a little take a little
[19:08] baby that's 6 months old and feed it
[19:11] stake.
[19:12] Now, I was little like that
[19:16] once. Well, yeah, I was. I would I would
[19:19] live like that 60s something years
[19:21] ago. And I love milk because I couldn't
[19:25] eat meat. I didn't have no teeth. I'm
[19:28] getting about that way
[19:29] now. But praise the Lord, they make
[19:32] false
[19:33] ones. But anyway, and I still eat meat,
[19:36] but I still like to drink milk every
[19:38] once in a while, too. But that's not my
[19:40] sustain. That's not my sustainment. I
[19:42] don't go to Texas Roadhouse and order a
[19:43] glass of milk and then leave. No, we get
[19:47] a big one. We get big steak. And y'all
[19:49] remember now June, the Saturday before
[19:52] Father's Day, I remind y'all this before
[19:55] Father's Day, June, whatever that is,
[19:57] June the 16th, 17th, we're going to all
[19:59] the men and the young boys are going to
[20:01] deer lodge to eat steak. And you talking
[20:03] about steak. You better be hungry when
[20:05] you go up there. I I wish you was as
[20:08] hungry here to hear this than you would
[20:09] be the that steak up there because this
[20:13] is much better than that steak. It'll
[20:15] sustain you a lot better. You know what?
[20:17] A couple days later, you'll get hungry
[20:19] again. You'll want to go back up here
[20:20] and get a steak again.
[20:23] Cuz he's a little boy. But we have a
[20:26] hand that reaches down and gets us and
[20:29] steadies us and said, "Make this step
[20:31] this way, son." He doesn't pick us up
[20:34] and spank us because we made a
[20:37] mistake. You didn't whip your child once
[20:40] they started walking. It was the cutest
[20:41] thing in the world.
[20:43] They'd fall, you'd laugh. But what did
[20:46] you do? You didn't whip them. You picked
[20:48] them back up and said, "I want my kid to
[20:50] walk before the neighbor's
[20:52] kid. I want my kid to be the first one
[20:55] to walk." So, you kept standing him or
[20:58] her up and if she fell or he fell over,
[21:00] you'd pick him right back up. You never
[21:01] spanked him. You picked him back up.
[21:03] That's the way Jesus Christ is. When
[21:05] we're born into the kingdom of God, he
[21:07] is a father because we cry, "Aba, father
[21:11] or daddy, daddy, and he's so gracious to
[21:14] come and say, hey, this is the way you
[21:16] walk. I know you're going to
[21:18] fall. I've already seen you fall before
[21:20] the foundation of the world, but I'm
[21:22] going to pick you back up right here,
[21:23] and I want you to walk again. I want you
[21:25] to take a few more steps." You remember
[21:26] when your kids started walking? How
[21:28] proud were you? Man, you were so proud.
[21:31] Then you had to take everything that
[21:33] they could get and put it up on the
[21:34] shelf because they now they going to get
[21:35] into
[21:36] everything. But it was glorious then,
[21:39] but not not when they started knocking
[21:41] stuff
[21:42] over, brother Bella. So he doesn't pick
[21:45] us up and spank us because we made a
[21:47] mistake. He doesn't beat us to death
[21:50] because we're trying to walk. He loves
[21:53] us like we love our children. A real
[21:56] daddy wouldn't whip his child when he's
[21:58] trying to walk. If he falls down on the
[22:00] floor, reach right down with a big
[22:02] strong hand and pick him up. Take both
[22:04] hands and hold and said, "This is the
[22:06] way you do it, son. Walk this way." What
[22:08] is that? That's this right here. Walk
[22:10] this way.
[22:12] This is the f This is the hand of God.
[22:15] Everybody with me? That's the way God
[22:18] does his church. Reaches down and gets
[22:21] him in his arms. Picks him up and says,
[22:23] "Walk this way, son. Here. Don't don't
[22:26] don't say it like that. Talk it like
[22:28] this. Now, I don't care what the church
[22:31] says, what this says, what this says.
[22:33] You say it like this. Like this. This is
[22:36] it. My word preaches it. You stay right
[22:39] with it. Don't care what everybody else
[22:43] says. Stay right with it. Walk like
[22:45] this. This is the way you make your
[22:48] steps. So, he's given us what? The word
[22:51] of God
[22:53] to guide our what? Footsteps. All right,
[22:56] everybody with me?
[22:58] Couple more. We'll get into the a little
[23:00] thought here and then we'll we'll
[23:03] close. Now watch what the prophet said.
[23:06] False teachers will bring false
[23:09] births. True prophets will bring the
[23:11] word the birth of the word which is
[23:14] Christ. False prophets will bring false
[23:17] birth. The birth of churches, creeds,
[23:19] denominations. And here you are
[23:21] Pentecostal brethren. Now watch this.
[23:23] False scent are
[23:24] sensations. and tell a man he's got the
[23:26] Holy Ghost because he speaks with
[23:28] tongues. Now, we don't believe in that.
[23:29] Paul didn't believe in that. Peter
[23:31] didn't believe in that. And God didn't
[23:32] believe in it. Everybody with me?
[23:35] Speaking in tongues is fine, but it's
[23:38] not your evidence.
[23:41] The evidence of Holy Ghost is where you
[23:42] can do what this word says or not. All
[23:44] right?
[23:48] Because he says, look, he says, not the
[23:50] birth of all these things, he's he tell
[23:51] the man he's got the Holy Ghost, go just
[23:53] speaks with tongues. I've seen devils
[23:54] speak with tongues, pencils laid right
[23:57] in unknown tongues, that's not God. I'll
[23:59] put that in there. But if the life isn't
[24:02] there to back it up, that's what he's
[24:04] talking about. So, I want you to just
[24:07] for a moment, let's look at something
[24:08] here and then we'll we'll type it for a
[24:11] second in the in the Old Testament. But
[24:14] remember, when you're born again or when
[24:16] you come to
[24:18] Christ, you're a newborn
[24:20] babe. Old things are passed away.
[24:22] Behold, all things have become new.
[24:24] Everybody with me? All right. It's
[24:26] simple, but this is the way we get here.
[24:28] All right. And he becomes your savior.
[24:33] Now,
[24:35] potentially, he's your bridegroom,
[24:38] but you're not thinking about that at
[24:40] the moment.
[24:42] Everybody with me?
[24:44] Our mental attitude is that he saved me
[24:48] from my sins, so he's my savior.
[24:52] He's my healer. He's my
[24:55] redeemer. He's my all and all. He's all
[24:58] the compound names. But remember, there
[25:01] comes a time when the Bible talks about
[25:04] a bride.
[25:07] And the bride is not a baby. A wife is
[25:10] not a baby. So now we see him a little
[25:13] bit more as not so much savior. Now
[25:17] remember, if he saved you one time, if
[25:20] he has saved your soul, he don't have to
[25:23] ever save you again. He won't do it. He
[25:25] doesn't have to. All right, everybody
[25:27] with me?
[25:31] But there is a time when we're walking
[25:32] in God that we need to learn that he's
[25:35] our head.
[25:37] You're not worrying about that. He's
[25:38] your savior when you're first born
[25:40] again. But then headship comes under
[25:43] when you marry and you become a bride.
[25:46] Huh? Come on. And you make him your
[25:48] bride. He's your bridegroom. Then you
[25:50] come under headship just like in the
[25:52] book of Genesis.
[25:54] Everybody with me? And Paul tells what?
[25:56] He tells us in the Bible, he tells us to
[25:59] what? Honor your husband. He's the head
[26:01] of your household. He's your head. And
[26:04] then listen, remember men, we can't beat
[26:06] our chest because we have a head. We're
[26:09] bride also.
[26:12] Everybody with me? Your bride also.
[26:14] We're the bride of Jesus Christ. male or
[26:16] female. It's what Paul said. Doesn't
[26:18] matter. Male or female, circumcised,
[26:20] uncircumcised. You come into the body of
[26:22] Christ, you become the bride of Jesus
[26:26] Christ. But at first, he's your tender
[26:28] savior.
[26:34] He lets you get by with some
[26:36] things. Come
[26:38] on. Hello.
[26:41] But there comes a time when Paul tells
[26:44] us that there's a time when God will
[26:46] wink in our ignorance and he'll kind of,
[26:48] you know, say, "Well, they're human. I
[26:52] know they're going to make mistakes."
[26:54] But there comes a time when he says,
[26:55] "Okay, now you're my wife. Me and you
[26:58] going to have to be a little bit more
[27:00] close together. We're going to have to
[27:02] start having the same mind." Come on,
[27:04] somebody. We're going to have to be
[27:07] what?
[27:08] together in love with one another and
[27:11] then what there is a after the marriage
[27:14] ceremon excuse me ceremony there's a
[27:17] getting together period of learning each
[27:21] other hello
[27:25] you did not marry your wife the first
[27:27] time I don't care you might have dated
[27:28] her for 25 years I hope
[27:32] not but when you get married and have to
[27:36] live in the same household with that guy
[27:39] and he used to smell real good on
[27:41] Saturday
[27:42] night and took a bath hopefully on
[27:46] Saturday before he met
[27:48] you. He smelled good, he looked good.
[27:51] Every time you saw him, his hair was
[27:53] just
[27:54] perfect.
[27:58] Amen.
[28:00] After you get
[28:03] married, he comes in smelling like a
[28:06] horse. His hair looks like he's been
[28:09] drugged by a
[28:10] horse. Well, hello
[28:13] somebody. Yeah, Donnie, I'm talking
[28:15] about
[28:16] you. But what? That's where you learn to
[28:20] really love each other and look what
[28:23] look past the inadequacies. look past
[28:25] the u you know my wife is beautiful and
[28:29] she's always beautiful to me. We were
[28:31] looking at some pictures you know her
[28:32] sister passed and I appreciate all your
[28:34] prayers and continued prayers but we got
[28:36] to reminisce and you know how people
[28:38] pass somebody pass away and you'll pull
[28:40] out all the all the pictures. So we were
[28:43] pulling out all the pictures. Well I met
[28:45] her when she was 17 and we pulled all
[28:47] those pictures out and I just got all
[28:49] excited all over again. So and you
[28:52] should do that the same way with your
[28:53] wife too.
[28:55] She was beautiful. I said, "You're
[28:57] beautiful. Still
[28:58] beautiful." I don't care what
[29:01] changed in the
[29:04] picture. It's the love that takes over
[29:06] now.
[29:08] So God's the same way. He's not going to
[29:10] listen, God's not going to condemn you.
[29:12] And listen, God can't condemn you for
[29:16] what you did in the past if you have
[29:19] repented. Amen. We can remember those
[29:22] fights and fusses and where we were when
[29:24] when we got mad at each other and
[29:27] and
[29:28] right. But if we place it under the
[29:31] blood and and ask God to forgive us,
[29:33] then our matrimony with Jesus Christ is
[29:35] perfect.
[29:37] If we'll stay that way, if we'll stay
[29:39] fortified with our spouse, then we
[29:42] won't, yes, we'll have human problems,
[29:45] but we won't have any problems with him
[29:47] if we stay fortified behind our husband.
[29:50] Everybody with me. Now, watch. Now,
[29:52] Brother Brown's continuing on. Notice
[29:55] the harmony of the father and the son.
[29:56] Jesus never did anything until it was
[29:58] first showed to him by the father. John
[30:00] 5:19.
[30:02] This harmony is now to exist between the
[30:04] groom and his bride. All right? So now
[30:07] there's bringing in
[30:10] harmony. He shows her his word of life.
[30:15] She receives it. She never doubts it.
[30:18] Therefore, nothing can harm her, not
[30:21] even
[30:22] death. For if the seed be planted, the
[30:25] water will raise it up again. Here is
[30:27] the secret of this. The word is in the
[30:30] bride as it was in Mary. What? Baby. A
[30:35] baby inside of Mary. Right. There was a
[30:36] baby that was not conceived by human
[30:39] beings. A created germ and a created egg
[30:42] by God himself placed into the womb of
[30:45] Mary. Man had nothing to do with it. She
[30:47] was just the oven to make the thing
[30:49] grow. And I can call it a thing because
[30:52] the Holy Ghost said that thing this
[30:54] thing will be born in you. Be born of
[30:55] the Holy Ghost. All right. So the word
[30:57] is in the bride as it was in Mary. The
[30:59] bride has the mind of Christ for she
[31:01] knows what he wants done with the word.
[31:03] Now this this is the
[31:05] bride, not a
[31:07] baby. He's moved out of the savior part.
[31:10] We remember him as being our savior. He
[31:13] saved us once. He's not going to have to
[31:14] save us like that again because
[31:17] salvation is of the Lord. He doesn't we
[31:19] don't believe in we do not believe in
[31:22] that if we have a good day then we're
[31:24] born again and then we have a bad day
[31:26] tomorrow and we're not born again.
[31:29] God's not an Indian giver. If he give
[31:31] you the Holy Ghost, if he burn all that
[31:32] old nature of you out and put his self
[31:36] his self inside of you, then he can't
[31:40] take himself out.
[31:44] Now listen, he can anoint you. He can
[31:46] anoint the anointed ones. He can anoint
[31:48] Caiaphas. He can anoint Judas. But they
[31:51] never came to a what? A conception in
[31:54] their soul. God never got into their
[31:57] soul and birthed them into the family of
[31:59] God.
[32:02] The bride has the mind of Christ for she
[32:04] knows what he wants done with the word.
[32:06] Now this is what this is the maturity
[32:08] part. She performs the command of the
[32:11] word in his name. For she has thus
[32:14] sayeth the Lord. Then the word is
[32:17] quickened by the spirit because you got
[32:19] to have both. You got to have word and
[32:20] spirit. Jesus said, "My words are what?"
[32:23] Spirit and life. All right? Then the
[32:25] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[32:27] comes to pass. Like a seed that's
[32:29] planted and watered, it comes to full
[32:32] harvest. Now watch. Serving its purpose.
[32:35] Full harvest. We're not talking about an
[32:37] immature plant. We're not talking about
[32:38] a plant that's just coming up out of the
[32:40] ground. We're talking about a plant that
[32:42] has fruit on it, bearing
[32:50] fruit. So
[32:53] now let the prophet tell us what is
[32:56] adoption. Now let me get this. Now I
[32:58] don't know whether I won't have time to
[33:00] get through all this but what he says he
[33:01] says
[33:03] look your adoption is not your
[33:06] birth. All right. I've said before, you
[33:09] can be born again by the spirit of God,
[33:12] and you can
[33:14] decide whether you want to go on with
[33:16] God or not, but I'm going to explain to
[33:19] you what happened to a group of people
[33:21] in the Old Testament when they didn't go
[33:23] on with
[33:24] God. Everybody with me? All right. In
[33:27] just a second. So, your adoption is your
[33:29] placing. So, what happened when we get
[33:31] to the Old Testament? What was Moses's
[33:34] commission to get them to the promised
[33:41] land? Not into the promised land. He got
[33:44] them up to the promised land. Joshua
[33:47] took over and took them into the
[33:49] promised land. But there was a situation
[33:52] happened right before they got ready to
[33:54] go. That's type just perfect in what
[33:56] we're typing now and what we're typing
[33:58] in the end time. Everybody with me?
[34:00] We'll get to it in just a second. Your
[34:01] adoption is your placing. When you were
[34:04] born again, I believe when you are born
[34:07] again of the spirit of God, you are sons
[34:09] of God. Remember, he cannot change his
[34:12] mind. But we were predestinated or what?
[34:15] Predetermined. God saw that
[34:18] beac would want it more than life
[34:20] itself. That they would want to grow
[34:22] with God. That they want more of God
[34:24] instead of just sitting in a church.
[34:28] It says a walk with God, not a sit down.
[34:34] Even Paul says, "Let's run this race."
[34:38] Now, here's what I'm trying to get to
[34:39] you. For this, sons of the last day.
[34:42] Now, what's he doing? He's bringing it
[34:43] to the last
[34:44] day. The sons of the last day. See, we
[34:47] were predestinated unto
[34:50] adoption. Now, here we are. He said, now
[34:53] here we are. Now, this is what hurts
[34:55] Pentecostals a little. They say, "I got
[34:58] born again. Praise the Lord. Got the
[34:59] Holy Ghost." Fine. Now, watch. You're a
[35:02] child of
[35:03] God. That's right. But yet, that ain't
[35:06] what I'm talking
[35:08] about. That whole adoption series is not
[35:11] talking about being born again. It's
[35:13] talking about growing in God, being
[35:16] adopted into the family, whether your
[35:18] name is good on a checkbook as your
[35:19] father's name is. Adoption is placing a
[35:26] son. Now look now after you come into
[35:29] eternal life, after you've been saved,
[35:32] sanctified, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[35:35] your sons. Now what happened? And we'll
[35:37] read it in just a second. But what
[35:38] happened in the wilderness? What
[35:41] happened to the children of Israel,
[35:42] which is a type of me and you? Everybody
[35:45] with me? Don't go to sleep. Say amen. We
[35:47] got visitors here. Thank you.
[35:51] Well, what happened? Moses took them
[35:53] where? Out of
[35:55] Egypt. Egypt being a type of the world,
[35:59] right?
[36:02] They were in the world, but they were
[36:05] not of the world. They were taken out of
[36:08] the world,
[36:10] justified. Their wilderness journey was
[36:13] called the wilderness of sin.
[36:16] So, you're walking through, you're
[36:17] you're what? You're coming to
[36:19] sanctification, which is cleaning them
[36:21] up, getting them ready. Actually, what
[36:22] it done, it cleaned them up so much
[36:23] there was only two left on the other
[36:25] side.
[36:27] Two million went out, two went in with
[36:29] their children. Everybody with me? All
[36:32] right. So, you get though, what is our
[36:34] promised land? It's Canaan.
[36:37] You had to cross over Jordan.
[36:40] Death to
[36:41] yourself. Jordan always always means
[36:45] death. But you got to cross Jordan, over
[36:48] Jordan, into the promised land before a
[36:51] Joshua comes and takes over to place you
[36:55] into that land. Is everybody with me?
[36:59] So now after you come into eternal life,
[37:02] after you've been saved, sanctified,
[37:03] filled with the Holy Ghost, in other
[37:04] words, your journey has carried you to
[37:06] Kadesh Barnea where you have to make a
[37:09] decision to go on or stay. All right?
[37:13] Then the ones that went over didn't
[37:15] listen to them other 10 lying preachers
[37:17] cuz 12 people went over there. They come
[37:20] back and said, "It's a good land. It's
[37:22] nice. It's good, but we can't take it."
[37:26] But Joshua and Caleb says, "We're more
[37:28] than able to take it." That's a Joshua
[37:30] and Caleb group that I'm looking at
[37:31] today. The Holy Ghost with Joshua in a
[37:34] group of people called the bride of
[37:37] Jesus Christ, which is Caleb. Caleb
[37:40] said, "Give me my mountain." Amen.
[37:43] Now
[37:44] watch. After you've been saved,
[37:46] sanctified, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[37:48] your
[37:49] sons. Now God's wanting to place you
[37:53] positionally. Now what is that word
[37:56] place? It's it's a position. It's
[37:58] somewhere you if you take a position in
[38:01] work, say you go to work and and you
[38:03] work for a little while and they offer
[38:05] you
[38:06] what? A position.
[38:09] It's something new. In other words,
[38:11] instead of you just being a a worker
[38:13] that works all out through here, all of
[38:15] a sudden, the boss is going to give you
[38:17] a position. He's going to give you
[38:19] something to do. Listen to me.
[38:23] specific to what you were before.
[38:26] And you might be able to go out here and
[38:28] roam around a little bit, but he wants
[38:30] you to take this position and stay in
[38:31] it. Because he has he has looked at you
[38:34] and and saw you as the Holy Ghost looks
[38:37] at you down through your life and says,
[38:38] "Hey, this is where you need to be right
[38:40] here."
[38:41] Cuz everything fits. Your attitude fits.
[38:46] I didn't say your attitude had to fit. I
[38:48] said your attitude fits. Okay, maybe
[38:51] I'll wake you up a little bit. Now,
[38:53] God's wanted to place you positionally.
[38:55] Oh, so that what? So that you can
[38:58] work for the kingdom of God and his
[39:02] glory. Remember in the type in the Old
[39:05] Testament when they came up to Kades
[39:07] Barnea, the 10 the 12 spies went across,
[39:10] they all came back. Two of them said
[39:12] we're more than able. The other 10, as I
[39:14] preached a long time ago, on 10 lion
[39:15] preachers, that's what it was. They
[39:17] preached their they preached their
[39:20] angle. We're
[39:22] grasshoppers. We've never seen people
[39:24] this big. We can't take it. Well,
[39:27] there's a whole group believed them and
[39:30] they wandered for 40 years in the
[39:32] wilderness. But Joshua and Caleb was
[39:34] ready to go over that day.
[39:36] But what the unbelief of the people kept
[39:39] them in the wilderness. The unbelief is
[39:41] what's keeping you and me in our
[39:44] position we're in now, which is not the
[39:47] position God wants us in. He wants us to
[39:50] go on. He want he wanted Moses to take
[39:52] us to the to the edge of the promised
[39:54] land. But there was a Joshua standing
[39:57] there that was more than
[39:59] able to not just take the group over,
[40:02] but to say, Ephereim, you go here.
[40:04] Manasses, you go here. You go here.
[40:06] There's something going on here. In just
[40:07] a few minutes, I'll prove to you what's
[40:09] happening in the end time by the word of
[40:12] God. All right, get to it in just a
[40:15] second. Here we go. Right
[40:18] here. Now, I've typed it with Joshua. If
[40:22] you notice, Israel was brought up out of
[40:24] Egypt. And there's three stages of their
[40:27] journey. Now, is there not three stages
[40:28] of your journey? journey, justification,
[40:31] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[40:33] Holy Ghost brings the new birth, which
[40:35] puts you a son and daughter of God.
[40:38] Everybody with me? So, there's three
[40:41] stages of their journey. What? One stage
[40:43] was what? Leaving Egypt type in the
[40:45] world. The next stage was the
[40:46] wilderness. What? To get to clean
[40:49] everything out. Get rid of all the
[40:50] riffraff. Hello. Get rid of all the
[40:53] things you used to do. I don't do them
[40:54] no more.
[40:56] And the next stage was Canaan.
[41:01] All right, you with me?
[41:04] Now, Canaan does not represent the age
[41:06] of the
[41:08] millennium. It only represents the age
[41:11] of the overcomer. Remember in
[41:13] Revelations, you've got seven
[41:15] overcomings in the church age and one
[41:17] overcoming after the white throne
[41:19] judgment, after the holy city comes
[41:21] down. There's an overcoming. To he that
[41:23] overcome gets all things.
[41:28] All right, you ready? It only represents
[41:31] the age of the overcomer, the
[41:33] dispensation of overcoming. Now look,
[41:36] when we get in the millennium, we don't
[41:37] have to overcome. We've already
[41:40] overcome.
[41:43] Because in Canaan, they killed and
[41:45] burned and took cities. In other words,
[41:46] when you cross over into their promised
[41:48] land, when you're promised a new birth,
[41:51] you're not promised that you won't get a
[41:52] bill in your mail.
[41:55] You're not promised that your car will
[41:57] never run out of gas. You're not
[42:00] promised that we don't preach prosperity
[42:02] here except the prosperity that's in the
[42:04] word of God. Cuz you going to have
[42:06] troubles, heartaches, trials. Jesus did.
[42:09] So you are.
[42:11] Everybody with
[42:13] me. Because Canaan, they killed, burned,
[42:16] took cities, and there's no death in the
[42:18] millennium. But another thing that it
[42:20] does, it brings up justification by
[42:22] faith. Listen, they believed Moses and
[42:26] left Egypt. Moses is the top of of the
[42:28] Lord leading you through your journey.
[42:30] So they believed Moses's message. So
[42:32] that justified
[42:33] them. They
[42:36] believed. All right. Bible says,
[42:38] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[42:39] thou shalt be saved." All right. They
[42:42] came out. They came out under
[42:45] sanctification. Followed the pillar of
[42:47] fire, the atonement of the sacrificial
[42:49] lamb. But what happened during that
[42:50] wilderness? They would groan and
[42:52] complain and God give them something and
[42:53] he'd kill them.
[42:56] Remember they complained about the mana.
[42:57] He gave them quail and as while the
[42:59] quail was in their teeth, he sent
[43:00] serpents among them because he's going
[43:02] to prove that I gave you mana and mana
[43:04] is what you're going to eat. I gave you
[43:06] the word of God. That's what I want you
[43:09] to eat. I don't want you to eat
[43:10] something else because it'll kill you.
[43:12] This won't.
[43:14] Even when they eat mana, mana was so
[43:16] pure. It took care of
[43:19] everything. Amen.
[43:21] Do you know in in in Jewish tradition,
[43:24] now this is tradition, they can't prove
[43:26] it, but Jewish tradition is there was no
[43:29] um there was no sight or there was no
[43:32] writings of a bathroom or a latrine with
[43:36] two million people walking for 40 years.
[43:39] No
[43:41] bathrooms because usually history will
[43:43] say this, you know, this you got this
[43:44] and because we all have to go to the
[43:45] bathroom. That was so pure. They said
[43:48] that mana was so pure that it absorbed
[43:50] in their body.
[43:52] Oh, it came from God. It wasn't a little
[43:54] Debbie cake. That will kill
[43:59] you. Little Debbie is not kind.
[44:04] It'll give you a shape. That's for sure.
[44:06] A round one.
[44:09] But round is a shape.
[44:12] So they were sanctified through the
[44:14] falling of the pillar of fire, the
[44:16] atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the
[44:18] wilderness and then entering into a land
[44:20] listen that had been
[44:23] promised. God told him in the journey.
[44:25] Now listen, God is omnipotent. God is
[44:28] all knowing. He knew when two million
[44:30] left Israel uh left Egypt that only two
[44:34] people of the original group was going
[44:36] to be
[44:37] left. But yet he told them every day,
[44:39] "If you'll do this, I'll give you this.
[44:41] Go here. Here, I'll do this. I'll give
[44:42] you water that'll water two million
[44:44] people, plus cattle and horses and
[44:47] donkeys and lambs the whole time you're
[44:50] in the in the wilderness.
[44:52] That river followed them wherever they
[44:54] went. And it wasn't just
[44:56] a it was a gusher. It had to to feed
[45:00] that many people. And all listen, they
[45:01] didn't go get a diet coke.
[45:04] There wasn't anything on there wasn't
[45:06] anything on the corner for them to go
[45:07] buy. It was water.
[45:12] But you know that mana was so pure that
[45:15] they didn't even need to change
[45:17] clothes. Bible
[45:19] says, right? Bible says the shoes that
[45:22] they wore stayed on their feet. The
[45:24] clothes that they wore stayed on their
[45:25] body. Wow. Walmart would be out of
[45:28] business, wouldn't
[45:29] it? So he gave us a pro. What is the
[45:32] promised land? The promised land is the
[45:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost. This promise
[45:36] is unto you and your children. them that
[45:38] are far off of me as the Lord our God
[45:39] shall call. Everybody with me? All
[45:41] right, so now listen, then we'll get
[45:43] into
[45:44] it. Now remember, they had to eat
[45:47] mana through the
[45:50] wilderness. All right, everybody with
[45:52] me? Angels food out of heaven until they
[45:56] crossed over into the land. And when
[45:58] they crossed over the land, the mana
[46:01] ceased to fall. All
[46:04] right. They were fully matured
[46:08] then.
[46:10] Okay. And they eat the old corn of the
[46:13] land. In other words, what somebody had
[46:16] planted, they ate the corn that was
[46:18] already matured. They didn't have to eat
[46:20] mana anymore. They were eating what?
[46:22] Fully developed ears of corn.
[46:26] Now that's you're not babies
[46:29] anymore. Now that you're not desiring
[46:31] the sincere milk of the gospel that you
[46:34] don't have to be babyed and patted and
[46:36] persuaded to come to
[46:39] church, now that you're real, fully
[46:42] matured Christians, you're ready to eat
[46:44] strong meat. Now you're ready to come
[46:47] into something and you're ready to
[46:50] understand something that's deep and
[46:53] rich.
[46:54] Oh, we'll get to it directly. Oh, it's
[46:56] been hidden since the foundation of the
[46:57] world. He said, "Now that you've come to
[47:00] this, I'm addressing this to
[47:03] you." Not those that left
[47:07] Egypt. All right? Not left, not the
[47:09] mixed multitude, not the ones that left
[47:12] Egypt. Not to
[47:14] those look who are still in the
[47:19] journey. You're not a fully matured.
[47:21] You're not full. You're not a full
[47:22] Christian till you get into the promised
[47:24] land. All right, everybody with me? But
[47:26] to those who are in the promised land
[47:29] that has received the
[47:32] promise. Now, how many has received the
[47:34] promise of the Holy Ghost? Amen. Oh,
[47:37] aren't you glad you're in the land over
[47:40] here now eating the old corn, eating the
[47:42] strong things of God and got a clear
[47:46] understanding. Your spiritual mind is
[47:48] all muddled up. You know exact is not
[47:51] all muddled up. You know exactly who he
[47:54] is. You know exactly what he is. You
[47:56] know exactly where you're going. You
[47:58] know exactly all about it. You know in
[48:00] whom you have believed and persuaded
[48:01] he's able to keep that which you've
[48:02] committed to him against that day.
[48:05] You're not babies running around all
[48:06] over the place. You're wanting to be
[48:09] placed. You have come into a promised
[48:10] land. God's promised you a piece of
[48:12] ground.
[48:15] If you got a kid today, that's your
[48:18] piece of
[48:19] ground. That piece of ground came out of
[48:22] you, didn't it?
[48:24] So that's your piece of ground. You need
[48:26] to claim it. Amen. We claim all of our
[48:29] children. We want our children saved,
[48:30] sanctified, full of the Holy Ghost. And
[48:32] I want them to be mature.
[48:36] Amen. To
[48:39] mature. All right, let's look in the
[48:41] Bible. Let's go to Numbers
[48:44] 32:1. Now, what happened is, let me set
[48:46] the stage for
[48:47] you. What happened is is there's a
[48:51] couple of tribes come to
[48:53] Moses and I'll read it here, but I want
[48:56] to kind of paraphrase. It was um Reuben,
[49:00] which was the firstborn,
[49:03] Gad, and Manasses. Okay? They were sheep
[49:07] herders. They were cattle farmers.
[49:10] Everybody with me? All right, listen
[49:12] real quick. Be done in just a few
[49:14] minutes because this ain't going to last
[49:15] very long. Maybe another hour.
[49:21] Numbers verse 32. Now the children of
[49:24] Reuben and the children of Ga Gad had a
[49:27] very great multitude of cattle. This is
[49:29] the Bible. Numbers 32:1 if you want to
[49:31] turn there. And when they saw the land
[49:33] of Jazar and the land of Gilead, that
[49:36] behold a place was a place for cattle.
[49:40] So the children of Gad and the children
[49:42] of Reuben. Now these are two tribes. All
[49:44] right. Then Manasseh is going to come in
[49:47] a little later, but it's a type of
[49:49] what's going on today. Everybody with
[49:51] me? The children of Gad and the children
[49:54] of Reuben came and spake unto Moses. Now
[49:56] look, they didn't speak to Joshua. Moses
[49:58] is still alive.
[50:00] All right?
[50:02] They're not in the promised land yet.
[50:04] Everybody with me? Because Moses died
[50:06] before they went in the promised land.
[50:07] So Moses is still alive. The messenger
[50:10] is still alive.
[50:12] All
[50:13] right. Speak unto Moses and to Eleazar
[50:16] the priest and to the prince of the
[50:18] congregation say. Now here's the two
[50:19] heads of the tribe and then Manasses is
[50:22] going to come in a little bit later. But
[50:23] it's going to make a perfect type of
[50:25] what's happening today. Ador, Dabon,
[50:28] Jazar, Nimrod, Heshbon. I wish it was
[50:31] Smiths and Dales, but it's not. They got
[50:33] funny names. Elila, Shabban, Nabau, and
[50:36] beyond.
[50:37] Even the country which the Lord smokeote
[50:39] before the congregation of Israel is a
[50:41] land for cattle and thy servants have
[50:44] cattle. All right. Now
[50:46] look, shake yourself just for a minute
[50:48] because you got to get you got to get
[50:50] the string of this or you'll or you'll
[50:51] miss it. Wherefore said they, if we have
[50:55] found grace in thy sight, talking to
[50:56] who? Talking to Moses.
[50:59] If I have found grace in thy sight, or
[51:02] we, let this land be given unto thy
[51:05] servants for a possession, and bring us
[51:08] not over
[51:10] Jordan. Now watch Jordan. Jordan is the
[51:13] gap between the wilderness of sin and
[51:16] the promised land. All right? They want
[51:20] their possession on this side of
[51:23] Jordan. All right? Promised land's on
[51:25] this side.
[51:27] They wanted to stay over here because
[51:29] this is a goodly
[51:32] land. And Moses said unto the children
[51:34] of Gad and to the children of
[51:37] Reuben, "Shall your brethren go to war,
[51:41] and shall you just sit
[51:43] here?" Cuz Moses knew when they were
[51:45] going to go across in the promised land,
[51:47] they was Canaanites, Hivites, Hittites,
[51:49] Jebusites, Websites, and all those
[51:52] otherites. All right?
[51:54] and he knew there was going to be war.
[51:57] And why would these two want to shun
[51:59] everything and stay over here and not
[52:02] help their brothers in the promised
[52:03] land? Everybody with me? All right, hold
[52:07] your hand up if I'm if I go past
[52:11] you because this is a beautiful type of
[52:13] what's happening now.
[52:16] Shall your brethren go to war, and shall
[52:18] you sit here? And wherefore discourage
[52:20] ye the heart of the children of Israel
[52:22] from going over into that land? In other
[52:25] words, we don't want to
[52:28] go. So the other brothers are saying,
[52:31] "Well, why we got to go over here and
[52:33] fight for our possession?" And they're
[52:35] staying over
[52:37] here. But Moses gave him a
[52:41] stipulation. Continue. And wherefore
[52:43] discourage ye the heart of the children
[52:45] of Israel from going over into the land
[52:46] which the Lord hath given them. Thus did
[52:50] your fathers when I sent them from Kades
[52:53] Barnea to see the land. So Reuben and
[52:56] Gad and halftribe Manasses, one of them
[52:58] three or all three of them were the
[53:01] three lion
[53:02] preachers that went across into the
[53:05] promised land and said we're not able to
[53:07] take that land.
[53:10] All right, you with me? So there's a
[53:13] precedence. Moses knows they went across
[53:15] into the promised land, came back and
[53:17] said, "We can't take it."
[53:20] But what a good God. Hang on a minute.
[53:22] Let's go to Numbers 32:20.
[53:26] Moses said unto them, "If you will do
[53:29] this thing, if you will go armed before
[53:33] the Lord to
[53:34] war, and will go all of you armed over
[53:37] Jordan before the
[53:39] Lord." Everybody with me?
[53:43] All right. So, you're not going to stay
[53:44] over here and sit down and eat pumpkin
[53:45] pie
[53:46] and and whipped cream.
[53:51] You got to help your brethren because
[53:53] you're all in the same family,
[53:56] right? Them 12 brothers were 12
[53:59] brothers. And that was the 12 tribes of
[54:01] Israel and they were all
[54:04] together. If you will go armed before
[54:07] the Lord to war and will go all of you
[54:10] armed over Jordan before the Lord. Now,
[54:13] so remember now that's taking them what?
[54:15] That's taking them, brother John. It's
[54:17] taking them into the promised land.
[54:19] Everybody with me?
[54:21] Even though they said, "We want our
[54:22] possession over here." Moses said,
[54:24] "That's okay, but you going to have to
[54:26] go over here and get you some fight.
[54:30] Help your brothers possess this land,
[54:32] and then he's going to tell them, then
[54:34] you can go back over and possess the
[54:36] property you have." All right? And
[54:38] that's a real good type of what's going
[54:40] on now. and will go all of you armed
[54:43] over Jordan before the Lord until he
[54:45] hath driven out his enemies from before
[54:48] him and the land be subdued before the
[54:51] Lord. Then afterwards you shall return
[54:54] and watch and be
[54:56] guiltless before the
[54:58] Lord and before Israel and this land
[55:01] shall be your possession before the
[55:03] Lord. But now watch. But if you will not
[55:06] do so, behold, you have sinned against
[55:09] the Lord, and be sure your sin will find
[55:12] you
[55:14] out. Build your cities for your little
[55:16] ones, and folds for your sheep. And do
[55:19] that which hath proceeded out of your
[55:22] mouth. And the children of Gad, the
[55:24] children of Reuben, spake unto Moses,
[55:26] say, Thy servant will do as my Lord
[55:29] commandeth.
[55:30] our little ones and our wives and our
[55:32] flocks and all of our cattle shall be
[55:34] there in the cities of
[55:39] Gilead. Let's go to Numbers
[55:44] 32 verse
[55:47] 27. But thy servants will pass over
[55:50] every man armed for war before the Lord
[55:53] to battle as my Lord saith. All
[55:56] right. The the two tribes and a half
[55:58] tribe. Got me? So now what? The
[56:01] separation of the half tribe has got
[56:03] some
[56:04] significance. All right, everybody with
[56:06] me? So that means that half of Manasseh
[56:08] is staying and half of Manasseh is
[56:11] getting a possession
[56:13] with me. All right, just for a minute.
[56:17] So concerning them, Moses commanded
[56:21] Elazar the priest and Joshua the son of
[56:24] Nun. I like that because Joshua was a
[56:26] type of Christ and he didn't he was a
[56:28] son of none. So anyway, and the chief
[56:30] fathers of the tribes of the children of
[56:32] Israel and Moses said unto them, "If the
[56:35] children of Gad and the children of
[56:37] Reuben will pass with you over Jordan,
[56:39] every man armed to battle." So they're
[56:42] ready to
[56:44] fight. And the land shall be subdued
[56:46] before you. Then you shall give them the
[56:48] land of Gilead for a possession.
[56:52] Everybody with me?
[56:55] Numbers 34:13. We got to continue. And
[56:57] Moses commanded the children of Israel,
[56:59] saying, "This is the land which you
[57:01] shall inherit by lot, which the Lord
[57:05] commanded to give unto the nine tribes
[57:08] and half tribe." So he had 12 tribes.
[57:10] Everybody with me? Nine and a half are
[57:13] going to
[57:14] stay. Two and a half are going to come
[57:16] back over here.
[57:18] They went in the promised land, but they
[57:21] came back.
[57:22] All right. Now
[57:24] watch. For the tribe of the children of
[57:26] Reuben according to the house of their
[57:28] fathers, the tribe of the children of
[57:30] Gad according to the house of their
[57:31] fathers have received their inheritance.
[57:34] And half the tribe of Manasseh have
[57:36] received their
[57:39] inheritance. The two tribes and the
[57:41] half-tribe have received their
[57:43] inheritance on this side
[57:46] Jordan near Jericho eastward toward the
[57:49] sunrising. Now remember, they went into
[57:52] the promised
[57:53] land,
[57:55] fought, but didn't take a possession.
[57:58] They didn't go any further. They went
[58:00] back to this piece of property over
[58:02] here. That be with me? Joshua verse 22,
[58:06] chapter 22:1. Then Joshua called the
[58:09] Reubenites and the Gadites and the half
[58:10] tribe of Manasses and said unto them,
[58:12] "You have kept all that Moses the
[58:14] servant of the Lord commanded you, and
[58:16] have obeyed my voice and all that I
[58:19] commanded you. You have not left your
[58:21] brethren these many days unto this day,
[58:24] but have kept the charge of the
[58:25] commandment of the Lord your God. And
[58:27] now the Lord your God hath given rest
[58:30] unto your brethren, as he promised them.
[58:33] Therefore now return ye and get you into
[58:35] your unto your tents and unto the land
[58:37] of your possession which Moses. Now
[58:41] remember Moses was the lawgiver.
[58:45] Joshua was Jehovah savior. Moses was the
[58:48] lawgiver. All right everybody with me.
[58:52] But now you got to remember though those
[58:54] two tribes and half tribe they went
[58:57] across Jordan into the promised
[59:01] land. Right?
[59:04] They got born again by type, but they
[59:07] didn't want to go on further. They
[59:09] wanted to go back and take up this land
[59:11] over here because it was a good land.
[59:15] This wasn't what God promised. This was
[59:18] what God promised. But God allowed them
[59:20] through Moses to come back over here as
[59:22] a type.
[59:24] All right.
[59:26] But take diligent heed to do the
[59:28] commandment and the law which Moses, the
[59:30] servant of the Lord, charged you to love
[59:33] the Lord your God. In other words, you
[59:34] don't just come over here and fight and
[59:36] go back over here and live like
[59:37] heathens.
[59:39] You're you're
[59:41] Christians, but you don't want to go any
[59:43] further. You want to come back here.
[59:48] The Lord charged you to love your God,
[59:50] to walk in all of his ways, keep his
[59:52] commandments, and to cleave unto him and
[59:54] to serve him with all your heart, with
[59:55] all your soul. So Joshua, now that
[59:58] Jehovah
[1:00:00] Savior, the Holy Ghost, top of the Holy
[1:00:02] Ghost, right? Joshua blessed them and
[1:00:05] sent them away and they went in unto
[1:00:09] their
[1:00:10] tents. What are you saying, Brother
[1:00:12] Wade?
[1:00:15] You got
[1:00:18] Luther,
[1:00:19] Wesley, and
[1:00:26] Pentecost. Two and a half
[1:00:30] tribes. Luther went over and got the
[1:00:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost under their
[1:00:36] messenger, but they didn't go on with
[1:00:38] God. They come back over here into their
[1:00:41] denominational idea.
[1:00:44] Wesley said, "We'll go over and help you
[1:00:47] out, but we're not going to go any
[1:00:49] further. We believe in
[1:00:50] sanctification." But they were in the
[1:00:52] land, but God said, "It's okay. You can
[1:00:55] go back." And then Pentecost, they
[1:00:59] divided. Half of Pentecost went across.
[1:01:02] The other half already was over
[1:01:04] there. That was this group you're
[1:01:07] talking about now.
[1:01:09] But this half, them old ones that fought
[1:01:11] against brother Brandham and fought
[1:01:12] against all different things and said
[1:01:14] tongues was the evidence and all that
[1:01:15] stuff, they got the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:01:16] folks, they got the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost. They got into the promised land.
[1:01:20] They helped fight, but they didn't go
[1:01:23] on. They wanted to come back here where
[1:01:25] it was more
[1:01:26] comfortable to stay into their little
[1:01:29] denomination. And God winked at their
[1:01:31] ignorance and said, "That's okay." So
[1:01:34] Luther, Wesley, and Pentecost, they
[1:01:36] didn't come to a placing.
[1:01:39] They didn't come to adoption.
[1:01:42] But now that half
[1:01:45] tribe, that half tribe of Manasseh that
[1:01:48] stayed over there, I'm looking at them
[1:01:50] right now.
[1:01:52] These are the ones that wanted to be
[1:01:54] placed. They had a place on this side of
[1:01:56] Jordan. They didn't want to go back to
[1:01:57] their old denominational slop. They
[1:01:59] wanted to stay over here in the promised
[1:02:01] land, eat the old corn of the land,
[1:02:03] fight their fights. This is my land.
[1:02:05] Give me my property.
[1:02:10] This is mine. I'm moving on. God winked
[1:02:14] at Lutheran Wesley part of Pentecost and
[1:02:16] said, "We're
[1:02:17] satisfied. We're satisfied the way we
[1:02:19] are. We'll be all right. We don't know
[1:02:21] anything much about that furtherment of
[1:02:23] going on with God, but we've got this."
[1:02:25] And you know what? God winked at their
[1:02:26] ignorance and said, "Okay, I'll accept
[1:02:28] that, but you're not staying over
[1:02:31] here. You're not staying over here. This
[1:02:33] is the promise to give you full
[1:02:36] maturity.
[1:02:39] This is not."
[1:02:42] But he said, "Okay, but you got to go
[1:02:44] over there and
[1:02:46] fight. You can't say I'm a denomination
[1:02:48] to myself and I ain't going to go over
[1:02:50] and help nobody." No. They got the Holy
[1:02:52] Ghost under their anointing, under their
[1:02:54] messenger. where they received the Holy
[1:02:56] Ghost. Same one you got, but they didn't
[1:02:58] want to go on to the promised land. They
[1:03:00] wanted to come back over here where it
[1:03:02] was greener pasture,
[1:03:04] where they didn't have to do so much.
[1:03:07] They did fight over here, but remember
[1:03:09] when they came back over here, they
[1:03:11] still fought over there because they
[1:03:14] kept going on. So that half tribe of
[1:03:16] Manasseh, today I'm talking to you, that
[1:03:19] decided that I'm going to go on the
[1:03:21] promised land, stay on the promised
[1:03:22] land. I'm not going back over Jordan.
[1:03:25] I'm staying on this side and I'm going
[1:03:27] on with God. I'm taking the message of
[1:03:30] the hour and I'm going to stay in my
[1:03:31] promised land. I'm not going anywhere
[1:03:33] else. This is my land. This is where
[1:03:35] every soul of my foot, that's what I
[1:03:37] possess.
[1:03:39] Let's stand to our feet.
[1:03:44] That's what happened in the Old
[1:03:46] Testament as a type to showing us that
[1:03:50] they're only going to go so far. Amen.
[1:03:54] They're only going to go so far with the
[1:03:55] word. Brother Emanuel,
[1:03:58] but that that other tribe over here, I
[1:04:01] believe they was hanging around Caleb.
[1:04:05] They heard Caleb say, "Give me my
[1:04:06] mountain." They said, "Give me my piece
[1:04:08] of property."
[1:04:10] I know that we spoke in tongues back
[1:04:12] over here and God was good to us and he
[1:04:14] healed us and did all these things, but
[1:04:16] we want more.
[1:04:18] We want more.
[1:04:20] They come over and got the new birth.
[1:04:22] The other ones went back. They said,
[1:04:23] "Okay, they're still brothers. They're
[1:04:25] still part of the tribe, but they're
[1:04:28] going over
[1:04:29] here." Now, I'm going to find it, but
[1:04:31] brother Brandham tells
[1:04:33] us that either Gad or Reuben is one city
[1:04:38] that was there was a city in one of
[1:04:40] those two areas that Jesus went into.
[1:04:43] And I think it was when he Well, I know
[1:04:46] what it is.
[1:04:47] Gera.
[1:04:50] Gad. Gad. Gada. You know what happened
[1:04:52] in
[1:04:53] Gada? The demon, the possessed demon,
[1:04:57] they told Jesus to
[1:04:59] leave. Brother Brown said, he said,
[1:05:01] "That's why they turned him down, cuz
[1:05:03] that tribe never went over and stayed in
[1:05:06] the promised land." I'll find a quote
[1:05:09] and I'll bring it Sunday. But that's how
[1:05:11] perfect the word is. You look at these
[1:05:12] types and shadows and you see exactly
[1:05:14] that God will give you the Holy Ghost,
[1:05:17] but you got to decide whether you want
[1:05:18] to be in this promised land or not and
[1:05:19] stay there and get more of the old
[1:05:22] corner of the land. Don't go back to the
[1:05:24] mana. Don't go back to the real pretty
[1:05:26] fine things. Listen, we're going to get
[1:05:28] those little pretty fine things in the
[1:05:31] millennium.
[1:05:33] You and I will,
[1:05:35] but not here. We got to fight for every
[1:05:37] inch of ground. God bless you. Let's
[1:05:39] sing a song.
[1:05:41] Let's sing as the deer.
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:46] As the deer
[1:05:51] ped the water so my soul
[1:05:56] long through that your desire.
[1:06:01] Do you have a desire like that other the
[1:06:03] other nine trials and the half trial? He
[1:06:06] said, "I want this over here. I'm not
[1:06:09] going to stay right here. I want more of
[1:06:12] this promised land.
[1:06:15] I'm not satisfied to be here. I want
[1:06:18] more of God. You
[1:06:20] alone are my strength, my
[1:06:25] shield. To you
[1:06:28] alone does my spirit.
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:34] You, you
[1:06:36] alone are my heart,
[1:06:40] desire, and I
[1:06:43] long to
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:46] worship. Sing it to him. You're my
[1:06:49] friend.
[1:06:50] You are my friend and you
[1:06:55] are my brother.
[1:07:00] See, he's your king. He's your savior.
[1:07:02] He's your bridegroom. He's moving up.
[1:07:07] You and I are the queen.
[1:07:10] And he wants us to be a happy queen. The
[1:07:13] other so much more. Take all the
[1:07:16] possessions in the land and stay there
[1:07:19] cuz that's where it was promised. It
[1:07:21] wasn't promised over here.
[1:07:25] You strength, my shield.
[1:07:30] To you
[1:07:33] alone does my
[1:07:35] spirit
[1:07:38] give. You
[1:07:41] alone are my
[1:07:43] heart desire and I
[1:07:47] long to
[1:07:49] worship thee. I want say it now. Oh, do
[1:07:55] you really want Jesus Christ more than
[1:07:58] somebody give you a piece of gold or a
[1:08:01] big piece of silver? That'll go away.
[1:08:06] But if you take
[1:08:08] him, it's for
[1:08:10] eternity. You
[1:08:13] alone are the
[1:08:15] real joy giver and the
[1:08:20] apple
[1:08:21] of my eyes. Sing it to him.
[1:08:26] Oh, you
[1:08:29] alone are my strength, my
[1:08:33] shield. To you
[1:08:37] alone does my
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:42] spirit. You
[1:08:45] alone are my heart.
[1:08:49] desire and I
[1:08:51] long to
[1:08:54] worship thee. Thank God he gave us
[1:08:57] apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,
[1:08:59] and
[1:09:00] evangelists to help us when we get in
[1:09:03] the promised land to place us where we
[1:09:05] need to be. Brother Adam always says, he
[1:09:07] says, "Why would Ephereim is that was
[1:09:10] where the oil was?
[1:09:13] Why would he want to go over here in
[1:09:14] Manasseh's corn field and mess it up? If
[1:09:18] Manasseh is supposed to bring forth
[1:09:19] corn, let him bring corn. Let Ephraim
[1:09:21] bring forth the oil. But what the
[1:09:24] problem is is we want to be like that
[1:09:25] guy and that person over here and we
[1:09:27] want to be the biggest and the highest
[1:09:28] and we want to have this and we want to
[1:09:30] have all this stuff. No,
[1:09:32] just ask God one day. Just sit down one
[1:09:35] day and just
[1:09:36] say, "What's my purpose?"
[1:09:40] You know, you don't have to I don't have
[1:09:41] to tell you that, right? Unless I get a
[1:09:44] word from the Lord. I'm never going to
[1:09:45] tell you
[1:09:46] that. Well, I I believe Sister Rachel
[1:09:49] needs to see it. What it does, it puts
[1:09:51] something in her mind and it's not God.
[1:09:55] But if it's thus sayith the Lord, it be
[1:09:56] from God. But if God will drop down and
[1:09:58] say, "Hey, this is what I want you to
[1:09:59] do. I'm pleased to dwell in you, but I
[1:10:01] want you to do this right here. I want
[1:10:04] you to do this right here. This is what
[1:10:05] I want you to do." And you feel safe in
[1:10:07] it. and you feel where you got pride in
[1:10:10] it. And listen, that's when the Holy
[1:10:13] Ghost is going to go back to the Father
[1:10:14] and say, "They're doing exactly what you
[1:10:17] told them to do." Amen. And I'm pleased
[1:10:20] to dwell and happy to use
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:25] you to where we didn't get to it, but
[1:10:27] we'll get to it Sunday where where when
[1:10:29] you get saved, you get a checkbook with
[1:10:31] Jesus's name on it. write it for
[1:10:34] whatever you
[1:10:35] want. But there's going to be a day when
[1:10:37] he's going to hand you a blank check and
[1:10:39] says what you say. That's right. You say
[1:10:42] to this mountain, whatever you say and
[1:10:45] don't down in your heart, it'll be given
[1:10:47] to you. You say, "So the checkbook is
[1:10:50] blank. You put your name on it and put
[1:10:54] my children way down." Amen. And God
[1:10:59] will back it up cuz he said he would.
[1:11:02] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:11:04] thank you Lord for this evening you've
[1:11:05] gi us. Lord, thank you so much for the
[1:11:08] bride of Jesus
[1:11:10] Christ and for the word that we've been
[1:11:12] given in the end time that we can have
[1:11:13] so much confidence, Lord, that it come
[1:11:16] from you. Father, the world may be
[1:11:18] falling apart and all the different
[1:11:19] things going on. But Lord, as we said
[1:11:22] before, I believe we're in the right
[1:11:23] vehicle on on the right road. There may
[1:11:26] be bumps. There may be heartaches,
[1:11:28] potholes. There may be trials and
[1:11:30] tribulations, but Lord, I believe we're
[1:11:32] on the right path and you'll lead us
[1:11:34] through because you said you would.
[1:11:36] Father, forgive us of our faults and
[1:11:37] many mistakes. Lord, just continue to
[1:11:39] heal all of our bodies. Lord, and bless
[1:11:42] us, Lord, in our feeble efforts to to
[1:11:44] worship you, Father. Bless the ones that
[1:11:46] are on highways and different places
[1:11:48] that are sick, too. Lord, I ask you
[1:11:49] bless them, Lord. Just be with us as we
[1:11:52] come back together, Lord, this weekend,
[1:11:53] Father, that we'll take communion and
[1:11:55] footwashing. In your precious name we
[1:11:57] pray. Amen. God bless you. You're
[1:11:59] dismissed.
[1:12:01] I want you more.
