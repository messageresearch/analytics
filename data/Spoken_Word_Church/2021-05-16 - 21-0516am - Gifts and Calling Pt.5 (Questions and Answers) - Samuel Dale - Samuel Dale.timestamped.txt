[4:26] name amen ephesians
[4:30] 1 we'll start with verse 3.
[4:35] blessed be the god and father of our
[4:37] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[4:39] with all spiritual blessings
[4:41] in heavenly places in christ and once
[4:44] according as he has chosen
[4:46] us in him before the foundation of the
[4:49] world
[4:50] that we should be holy without blame
[4:52] before him in love
[4:54] what now having predestinated us unto
[4:57] the adoption of children
[4:59] by jesus christ to himself according to
[5:02] the good pleasure
[5:04] of his will and what is his will is his
[5:07] word you may be seated the lord that is
[5:09] blessing to the reading of the word amen
[5:17] now i'll just review just a little bit
[5:19] if you have questions then we can get a
[5:21] microphone
[5:22] and run back and let you uh give your
[5:24] questions and things and feel free to
[5:27] to question about anything in the uh
[5:30] point of what we've been talking about
[5:32] uh which has really been talking on
[5:35] predestination
[5:36] all right uh we kind of brought it to a
[5:39] close there the other night most of the
[5:41] services and things are last sunday to
[5:44] uh
[5:45] to talk about the uh the point
[5:48] of predestination and how do we believe
[5:51] predestination this
[5:52] slight review to where do what we do
[5:55] predestination well
[5:57] this is predetermined it's going to
[5:59] happen
[6:00] well now god doesn't predetermine by his
[6:03] desires
[6:05] because he desired it all be saved
[6:09] he doesn't predetermine by his own will
[6:12] or want to because that would pull over
[6:16] into
[6:17] the he predestinates really by your
[6:19] desire
[6:22] he predetermines by your desire because
[6:26] your desire will will move over into
[6:30] your life and you'll live
[6:31] that way and be guided in that form
[6:35] so we pre we believe in predestination
[6:38] which is destiny set beforehand all
[6:41] right
[6:41] but how is it done it's done by for
[6:44] knowledge god foreknew
[6:48] all things all right so then there's
[6:51] nothing we can pull over on him there's
[6:53] thoughts that you're having in your mind
[6:55] right now god before the world
[6:58] ever begun had that he knew that
[7:02] so just don't try to say what i you know
[7:04] i don't know
[7:05] i just don't don't think wrong because
[7:08] if you think wrong then remember
[7:10] your thoughts in heaven are louder than
[7:12] your voice on earth
[7:13] so that's going to to change it and make
[7:15] it
[7:16] make it all work uh to that point
[7:19] but to think about predestination
[7:24] a destiny is determined forever being
[7:28] in the world all right
[7:31] see that's why we don't just cover
[7:33] predestination for uh
[7:35] uh bribe people we have to get into
[7:38] deeper
[7:39] thoughts and meanings in that way but we
[7:42] go by predestination for all people
[7:46] everybody is predestinated
[7:49] what by god's foreknowledge
[7:52] all right that's that simple see god's
[7:54] foreknowledge
[7:55] allowed him to be able to set back there
[7:58] and look down through time and see the
[8:02] beginning
[8:05] but also he could follow all the way
[8:07] through with that same thought
[8:10] and see the ending of all things that's
[8:12] right so that's
[8:13] predestination that's destiny determined
[8:16] all right see then actually we're making
[8:18] our own destiny
[8:20] amen because it's not according to his
[8:23] desires
[8:24] it's according to our desire amen
[8:29] we desire to serve him god knew before
[8:31] the world ever begun
[8:33] that some people would want to be saved
[8:35] and some wouldn't
[8:36] right that's right see he's not setting
[8:39] a stamp on
[8:40] something and saying well this is the
[8:41] way it is this is the way you're going
[8:42] to be you're going to do
[8:43] no just remember it's all based upon
[8:48] what you're believing what your thoughts
[8:50] are
[8:52] what you're determining all right so we
[8:55] actually brother tom fathers had a good
[8:57] way of saying it was
[8:58] a good thought see we actually trigger
[9:00] our predestination
[9:02] in other words our destiny
[9:05] of where we're going is some way back
[9:08] here
[9:09] in life set in an order
[9:12] to where that will reach that point when
[9:15] we get there
[9:16] all right and see then it's all in us
[9:18] it's not in him
[9:19] all right man that's right see that's
[9:21] where the people of the message or they
[9:22] want all of these great thoughts and all
[9:24] like that
[9:25] and that's fine the prophet said he said
[9:27] you always was eternal
[9:28] amen i believe those things but just
[9:31] remember what was he talking about
[9:34] if you have eternal life amen
[9:39] that's as simple as can be if you have
[9:42] eternal life today
[9:43] if you have received the baptism of the
[9:45] holy ghost the new birth
[9:46] eternal life then that eternal life that
[9:49] you have
[9:50] always was eternal amen
[9:55] well see remember then it's not the
[9:58] person
[9:59] that comes predestinated eternally from
[10:02] god
[10:06] because it's according to our desire
[10:08] it's not that
[10:09] but it's it's not the person that comes
[10:11] predestinated eternally but it's the
[10:13] what
[10:14] the word our seed
[10:17] and there's a seed predestinated for
[10:19] every age there was people
[10:20] forever age upon the earth it's all set
[10:23] yeah
[10:23] why because he looked down and saw it
[10:26] right
[10:28] you say yeah but i didn't choose him he
[10:31] chose me well that's all right
[10:32] we'll get back to some of those thoughts
[10:34] and we'll pick up a few little
[10:35] points along the way you know but
[10:39] to think about it
[10:42] you say but but brother dale i sought
[10:44] him i cried
[10:46] i prayed that's good i believe that
[10:49] i don't believe the prophet was cutting
[10:51] it out when he said you didn't seek god
[10:53] or the bible saying that you didn't seek
[10:54] god
[10:56] he's showing us the point of what we was
[10:57] doing
[10:59] seeing our life we were seeking god
[11:02] trying to find god right he said well i
[11:06] wasn't trying to find him no but that's
[11:07] not what i'm getting at see it was him
[11:13] trying to find us he said adam
[11:17] where aren't they
[11:20] and see adam then had something to do
[11:23] with it
[11:23] right he had a choice that he had to
[11:26] make yep that's right
[11:28] and see then you're you're choosing it's
[11:31] based upon you
[11:34] on the basis of receiving it but it's
[11:37] receiving something that's
[11:39] already paid for
[11:42] it was already finished our salvation
[11:46] was set and sealed before the foundation
[11:48] world
[11:52] because he was looking at it as for what
[11:55] he
[11:55] saw then that way the thing can't say
[11:59] why did you do that like this you know
[12:02] you can't say to god but god you didn't
[12:04] give me a choice
[12:05] you you set my choice you you you no no
[12:08] he gave you a choice
[12:13] he gave you a choice see that's why it
[12:16] takes
[12:16] all of the word of god amen
[12:20] now i'm saying that with all that i can
[12:21] get with all of the word of god to come
[12:24] out to the correct answer of doctrines
[12:26] and ideas
[12:28] because if not you're going to say well
[12:30] i've got this quote
[12:31] yep that's right well all right
[12:35] he said that he said you always was
[12:38] eternal
[12:39] sure but we don't read the rest of the
[12:41] quote
[12:43] if you have eternal life he's explaining
[12:45] eternal life
[12:47] as being the person of jesus christ
[12:48] coming and living in us
[12:50] in the baptism of the holy ghost all
[12:53] right
[12:54] see then that way we have to we don't
[12:57] have to worry about it and try to figure
[12:59] out
[12:59] what i i just i just really don't know
[13:01] whether i'm called or not
[13:03] well you're just playing your own game
[13:06] and
[13:06] really crucifying your own self
[13:10] because you're not taking what he says
[13:14] he said jacob have i loved
[13:18] he saw how i hated it all right
[13:22] now did he hate esau with a word of hate
[13:26] that we call it now we've been through
[13:27] that right it wasn't the word hate thou
[13:30] or despising of it it was esau's ways
[13:34] that god hated amen he loved he
[13:38] loved jacob's ways
[13:42] and jacob's ways is hard for us to love
[13:44] sometimes because he was a shyster
[13:47] that's what the word mean tripper upper
[13:49] shyster he
[13:50] he you know well yet he loved god amen
[13:54] why did we cover through there for
[13:56] services and things
[13:57] why did god choose abraham because
[13:59] abraham
[14:00] he knew what abraham would do
[14:03] he knew as the prophet said that abraham
[14:06] would he teach his children the way of
[14:09] truth
[14:11] that's right then he knows whether or
[14:12] not you will
[14:16] see then let's make our calling and
[14:18] election sure
[14:22] then what do we believe god did not
[14:25] predestinate by his desires he
[14:27] predestinated by his
[14:29] that's right his foreknowledge lets him
[14:31] see what we will all do
[14:34] amen then he sees our choice amen
[14:39] he said well you just said i didn't
[14:41] choose him no
[14:42] you've got to accept the choice
[14:46] he can stand before you every day of
[14:48] your life and hold the word of god out
[14:49] in front of you
[14:50] unless you receive that as a as for you
[14:54] a pardon is not a pardon unless received
[14:56] as one
[14:57] unless you accept that amen that's right
[15:00] well then that's that's not
[15:04] destroying the rest word that you didn't
[15:05] seek him no it's
[15:07] explaining it
[15:10] we didn't have anything within us as
[15:12] humanly beings
[15:14] to be able to seek after god we were
[15:15] heathern
[15:18] well yet god put before us the path and
[15:21] give us a choice
[15:25] and then he could predestinate according
[15:27] to
[15:29] the choices we make that's right so
[15:32] don't blame god
[15:33] well now god just like i tell you my my
[15:35] brother's a methodist minister
[15:37] but he believes he said god didn't give
[15:40] me a choice
[15:43] i said yes he did
[15:46] i said he didn't make you what you are
[15:49] you made yourself what you are
[15:53] and he knew exactly what you would be
[15:55] right
[15:56] what you'd do so what is predestination
[15:59] it's a destiny
[16:00] set but it's set before the world
[16:05] because it set the part in the the point
[16:08] of god in his mind
[16:10] amen knew that before the world what
[16:13] choice you would make
[16:15] is that hard to comprehend well see then
[16:18] that way the thing
[16:19] form can't say why did you form it you
[16:21] can't say well god you never gave me a
[16:23] choice he said well look at all the
[16:24] choices again
[16:25] right like the story was told what about
[16:27] the the guy sitting on the top of a
[16:30] building you know her house and the
[16:32] water coming higher and higher
[16:34] and you know he kept praying lord send
[16:36] me help send me help and
[16:38] boat come by and he said no i don't want
[16:40] to get in that boat
[16:42] this happened and that happened i don't
[16:44] want to well when it was all finished
[16:45] and he died and went up to glory it's
[16:47] just a story for telling
[16:49] he said i sent you a boat i sent you a
[16:51] lot of ways for you to get out of the
[16:53] trouble you're then but you wouldn't do
[16:54] it
[16:55] so you chose your own self
[16:58] you can't blame god for the choices you
[17:01] make that's right
[17:03] amen you had a choice to marry a wife
[17:05] you had a choice to
[17:07] marry you know to have a husband or
[17:09] whatever you had a choice
[17:11] right well then you have a choice in
[17:15] christianity
[17:16] you can accept what he has done for you
[17:19] or
[17:20] reject what he has done amen
[17:24] but remember the point is he knew the
[17:27] choice
[17:28] amen i remember in
[17:32] in the baptists they used to say that uh
[17:34] you know that ark that
[17:36] that noah belt said uh it was big enough
[17:38] to carry everybody that was in the world
[17:42] and i used to tell them then i said i
[17:43] thought it was
[17:45] if the bible says as it was so is it i
[17:48] thought that was
[17:49] pretty close to billions of people that
[17:52] was in the world
[17:53] at the time noah because it would mean
[17:56] as it was so is it now
[17:58] you know and see you say well
[18:01] well what was the choice
[18:04] noah built an ark
[18:09] no i said well i don't know what's going
[18:12] on but i'm going to build an ark
[18:15] well see he proved his predestination
[18:18] by what he done you and i prove
[18:22] what we're doing by the life we live
[18:26] that way you can't blame god for you
[18:28] well i i
[18:29] i was just i i wasn't given a chance
[18:32] like everybody else
[18:33] i was born poor and and and things like
[18:37] i wasn't given a choice
[18:40] predestination don't have anything to do
[18:41] with how how much money you got in your
[18:43] pocket
[18:46] that doesn't you you can't blame god for
[18:49] things not happening the way you want to
[18:50] when you're too lazy to get up and go to
[18:52] work
[18:54] sorry but that's plain language but it's
[18:56] true that's right
[18:58] he said well god didn't give me a chance
[18:59] he gave this bird no here
[19:01] look at how they made millions of
[19:02] dollars if you've gotta went to work you
[19:04] could have made more than that
[19:08] i was standing up in jamaica one time
[19:10] first time i was over there
[19:11] little brother reed had told me he said
[19:13] well you know these people over here
[19:15] said they're
[19:16] a little different brother they'll i
[19:17] said little different nothing
[19:20] i said a lot of you say you ain't got no
[19:23] you're poor people you're just that the
[19:24] other
[19:25] i said if you get up and go to work
[19:28] well they didn't like that because you
[19:31] see that was their pity party
[19:33] they didn't have nothing to do i said
[19:35] get you because i seen them walking
[19:37] around when i've seen
[19:38] what they do i'll get you a machete and
[19:39] go down here and cut grass alongside the
[19:41] road
[19:42] still pay you but i said you're the one
[19:45] that's doing it
[19:47] you're just too sorry to go to work
[19:50] well it's the same thing to you and me
[19:53] you know what i mean
[19:55] see we make our own choosing that's the
[19:57] whole point that i've tried to
[19:59] get you to see you say yeah but if i
[20:00] make my choosing then god didn't have to
[20:02] do it
[20:03] but if if it was all god i didn't have
[20:05] nothing to do with it
[20:07] see you're trying to to uh
[20:14] backstep around the real truth of any
[20:17] of the whole time you're trying to walk
[20:21] away and try to blame everybody else
[20:22] you're trying to blame god
[20:24] and say well god made me this away god
[20:27] didn't make you that way
[20:29] that's right that's what i told my
[20:30] brother he said how can god judge me for
[20:32] being wrong when he made me wrong
[20:34] i said he didn't make you wrong amen
[20:38] because he made you right and gave you a
[20:40] choice yes
[20:42] then whatever you've done with a choice
[20:44] that's what determines it right
[20:46] because see that's predestination is a
[20:48] destiny set
[20:50] but the way god does it is by his
[20:52] foreknowledge
[20:55] well then that way you can't go over
[20:56] here and say well i didn't have a choice
[21:00] i didn't have an opportunity yes you did
[21:04] that's right
[21:08] you just didn't follow god in his ways
[21:10] that's right we had a choice
[21:13] you got a choice in life you got a
[21:14] choice to marry or not marry got a
[21:16] choice in this
[21:17] work or not work amen
[21:20] and see that's pretty good the way in
[21:21] america now they
[21:24] odd to me they're having to hire people
[21:26] at the mcdonald's and pay them a hundred
[21:28] dollars or 200
[21:29] just to sign on in some places they said
[21:32] as much as 500
[21:33] for you to come down and put in for a
[21:35] job
[21:37] that's right
[21:40] well no wonder why go to work when you
[21:42] can draw unemployment
[21:47] we made it like that
[21:51] but see it's our choice
[21:54] no it's our choice
[21:58] of life that god looks at
[22:01] and sees that choice and sees you for
[22:04] what you want to be
[22:05] in your own self
[22:10] but he gave he gives you every
[22:12] opportunity
[22:15] you want to go through the bible with
[22:16] anybody you want to take in the bible
[22:18] and let's just sit down and talk about
[22:20] it
[22:20] he said well he didn't give uh cain a
[22:24] choice yes he did
[22:26] he told cain he said would you not have
[22:27] been accepted had you done like your
[22:30] brother that's right
[22:31] don't talk to me about god not giving
[22:33] you a choice god didn't give me god
[22:35] didn't help me
[22:37] i was raised poor oh poor thing
[22:43] poor
[22:47] you don't like for me to talk do you
[22:49] when i was applying a mule all day long
[22:51] out in the field when i was seven years
[22:53] old
[22:59] that'd be child labor today wouldn't it
[23:02] you know that'd be bad that'd be pitiful
[23:05] they'd like putting their parents up for
[23:07] treating their kids like that but that's
[23:09] the only way we had to make it a living
[23:15] don't talk to me about it that's what
[23:16] you know they'd say they're at work well
[23:19] dale over he's they just wouldn't come
[23:21] over and talk to me about the pity
[23:22] pattern how bad it was and how
[23:24] everything was real
[23:25] i'd start talking about what i used to
[23:26] do
[23:28] and they just walk away and we was poor
[23:34] but see church we lived
[23:37] right and we made it
[23:40] my mother would not accept
[23:44] the things when they first started
[23:45] giving away
[23:47] of the cheese and the milk and the the
[23:50] stuff and all
[23:52] she wouldn't accept it
[23:55] i told her one day i said mom i said i
[23:58] don't know what you're doing
[24:00] but i said look there's nine of us that
[24:02] pays income tax
[24:04] nine kids at that time it was 13 and
[24:07] four died you know i said
[24:09] there's nine kids we pay income tax
[24:11] don't you think that's enough to take
[24:12] care of what little bit you'd draw
[24:16] or what little you'd go get
[24:20] because see she had pride
[24:23] you got a haircut every two or three
[24:26] weeks it didn't make no difference
[24:28] it may look like a bowl set on it and
[24:30] they cut around it and shipped it off
[24:32] it might have done it might look like a
[24:34] lot of things but
[24:36] we got a haircut why because that was
[24:39] pride
[24:41] why has america fallen because she's
[24:44] lost her pride amen
[24:46] that's right
[24:49] but it is not the same thing to say the
[24:51] bride of jesus christ is doing that
[24:54] she's losing her pride
[24:58] he said no no well you tell me
[25:02] where it used to be you know we believe
[25:03] this we believe that now
[25:05] what do we believe that's right and then
[25:08] we try to figure it out and try to blame
[25:12] god
[25:14] well i can i i quote the prophet to you
[25:17] thank god glad you can
[25:21] but you know one of these days that's
[25:23] going to be brought to judgment
[25:25] amen we're going to stand at the
[25:27] judgment seat
[25:30] you say no bro i don't know the bride
[25:32] don't go to the white throne
[25:34] she goes to judgment everybody faces a
[25:38] judgment
[25:39] the bride of jesus christ has a judgment
[25:42] but not a white throne judgment of the
[25:45] decision of eternal life or not no
[25:47] amen because that's not it but it's a
[25:49] judgment seat
[25:50] amen we're going to have to give an
[25:52] account
[25:55] for the things we've done whether good
[25:57] or bad the bible says
[25:58] that's right well i don't know i don't
[26:01] like that with that
[26:02] that well what are you going to do but
[26:04] do you understand
[26:05] amen predestination then
[26:09] to sum it up is the very point of a
[26:12] destiny
[26:13] that god looked down and saw
[26:18] and he could write your name in the book
[26:19] of life or leave it out amen
[26:23] but he would see your choice yes
[26:27] amen
[26:30] he's operating according to you what you
[26:32] choose choose you this day
[26:35] who you'll serve amen
[26:38] it's it's pretty it's not predetermined
[26:40] in the basis that
[26:41] that we don't have anything to do
[26:43] because like i said you've got to accept
[26:45] eternal life
[26:48] yeah but i'll come in the world with it
[26:50] i got the quotes we'll we're going to go
[26:51] to judgment when he dates all those
[26:53] quotes
[26:53] that's right and then we're going to see
[26:55] who's got what yeah that's right
[26:57] right all right it won't be no argument
[26:59] at that day
[27:01] it won't be nothing for lula church to
[27:04] say well i didn't understand
[27:07] they'll say well you remember that old
[27:09] hard-headed guy that preached to you
[27:11] year after year
[27:12] in and out days and weeks and months of
[27:14] trying to get you to see what
[27:15] predestination was
[27:17] and how that you had to make your own
[27:19] choice
[27:21] i'll be glad to stand there that way not
[27:23] to the point of trying to
[27:24] to judge me and you or whatever no but
[27:27] to stand there on the word of god that
[27:28] i've tried my best to preach to you
[27:31] to get you to see what true
[27:32] predestination really is
[27:36] it's god's foreknowledge that's right
[27:39] then you can't blame him for anything
[27:43] amen it would be
[27:46] said then that we have the plan
[27:51] uh because that's what i got just the
[27:53] notes if i do it if you don't uh
[27:55] you know anybody has any questions we'll
[27:57] go with a question but if you don't know
[27:59] this
[27:59] preacher little thought goes with what
[28:01] i'm talking about
[28:04] but you see what i'm i'm trying to get
[28:05] you to see
[28:08] amen he said yeah but brother today
[28:11] brother branham said we didn't choose
[28:13] him he chose us
[28:14] amen but you had to accept the choice
[28:19] that's right right that's right if you
[28:22] did not accept what he had done for you
[28:24] it won't do you no good that's right
[28:27] amen
[28:28] amen so then it's not blaming god
[28:31] right amen well i just wasn't treated
[28:35] right
[28:37] you poor little thing
[28:43] i told them people at work out there and
[28:44] they begin telling me about how bad it
[28:46] was and all
[28:46] you know in their life i said wheeze up
[28:49] before daylight
[28:50] you fed the mule before you ate
[28:52] breakfast
[28:54] because you were going to work him that
[28:55] day you watered the mule before you went
[28:58] to the field
[29:01] when you got through at lunchtime and
[29:02] got back to the house
[29:04] you fed and watered the mule
[29:08] before you went in the house to eat
[29:12] take about an hour you'd go make sure
[29:15] you'd water the mule
[29:18] you'd make sure he's doing okay because
[29:21] you knew he was going to be pulling the
[29:22] plow till dark come down
[29:27] they don't talk to me about bad times or
[29:30] hard times
[29:33] but see i know that we come through that
[29:36] why
[29:37] because we had a determination
[29:43] i told you about my mother whipping my
[29:46] brother with a
[29:47] metal ring off of a wooden barrel
[29:51] when he was 18 years old
[29:56] oh but now wait just a minute now i'm
[29:58] out from under my mama i'm 15
[30:00] 16. she ain't trying to write no no no
[30:02] no when you get 15 16 you got no sense
[30:05] to know what they're hammering on you is
[30:06] beating on his doing that's right
[30:10] you know what it was doing before then
[30:15] he was planning on leaving home she said
[30:16] you go back in the house and wait and
[30:18] you get down
[30:19] and get out of your mat spell then you
[30:20] can leave he went back in the house and
[30:22] said i don't know he never did leave
[30:24] home
[30:26] because he knew she was right and what
[30:27] she's doing
[30:30] see god sometimes has to whip his
[30:32] children my point he has to whip his
[30:34] children a lot of times to get us to
[30:35] line
[30:36] up and understand what's going on it's
[30:38] not no petty pat or little baby thing
[30:44] sometimes it's pretty hard on us being a
[30:47] christian is not a soft thing
[30:55] it's a wonderful thing to realize the
[30:57] end of all things when it finishes up
[31:00] and we get to enjoy the pleasures of
[31:03] eternity
[31:07] do you understand what i'm talking about
[31:08] now so anybody got a question anybody
[31:10] got a point
[31:10] on predestination on for knowledge
[31:14] on anything anybody got a point on
[31:19] question or comment
[31:26] well i guess either i preached it hard
[31:30] enough to where you'd understand what
[31:31] i'm talking about because
[31:33] that's what i've tried my best to do
[31:35] it's preached for you to see
[31:38] what it's all about the truth of it well
[31:40] no brother dale i just don't want to
[31:41] talk to you
[31:42] you won't listen to me
[31:48] you ever thought about it might not be
[31:50] you listening
[31:52] might not be me listening it might be
[31:54] god
[31:55] i ain't going to listen to our flim flam
[31:57] playing footy
[31:58] ideas or thoughts no i'm not
[32:05] i'm trying to be a human i try to be
[32:07] right i try to be a christian try to
[32:08] walk as one
[32:09] to be a pastor to try to help people and
[32:11] to do everything i could
[32:14] but i also know
[32:18] that you've got a choice you've got to
[32:20] make
[32:21] and you make your choice you make your
[32:23] calling an election sure
[32:25] you get everything right in the right
[32:26] order it'll come out to the right okay
[32:28] all right now think about it then if
[32:31] we're not
[32:31] no questions maybe i can create a
[32:33] question but
[32:36] think about it
[32:39] oh got a question okay
[32:42] okay wait
[32:45] wait we get the
[32:49] we want everybody else to hear you
[32:53] um i just wanted to know if you would
[32:55] elaborate a little bit more on
[32:58] the judgment you said the bride will go
[32:59] before i don't remember
[33:01] anything about that okay according to
[33:04] the bible now we
[33:06] as the bride of jesus christ number one
[33:09] nail it down the bride of jesus christ
[33:12] does not
[33:12] go to the white throne judgment because
[33:15] you have eternal life what would you be
[33:17] judged on the basis of that
[33:19] all right so you don't have to worry
[33:21] about losing eternal life and going to
[33:23] hell or anything like if you're born
[33:25] again
[33:27] if you're truly born again everything's
[33:28] already settled in that basis
[33:30] and it'll be okay but the bible says
[33:32] that we all must stand before the
[33:34] judgment seat of christ all right
[33:37] now that is not the white throne the
[33:40] white throne
[33:41] it will be no no uh
[33:44] it won't be no jesus christ standing at
[33:46] the white throne
[33:47] to plead your case if you're at the
[33:51] white throne you you're at the mercy of
[33:53] the
[33:53] of the point of heaven who's talking to
[33:55] you and and you can't say well now jesus
[33:58] i've got this quote where brother around
[33:59] and said this man walks out over here
[34:01] and takes my place
[34:03] he's not talking about the decision of
[34:05] eternal life
[34:06] that's right romans 14
[34:09] romans 14 10. all right
[34:13] right we must all stand we must all
[34:17] give an account well what am i going to
[34:19] be judged for
[34:20] for the things done in the body whether
[34:22] they're good or bad that i didn't get
[34:24] rid of
[34:26] that i didn't listen to the preacher
[34:27] that was hollering at me and trying to
[34:29] tell me everything what we're supposed
[34:30] to be doing
[34:31] i didn't do that so i've got to give an
[34:33] account
[34:35] not a decision of eternal life get it
[34:37] right now
[34:40] there's no such thing as the bride of
[34:42] christ going before the white throne
[34:44] judgment
[34:47] but we almost stand a judgment
[34:50] well what am i going to the things that
[34:52] we do that we don't
[34:56] repent of
[35:00] whoa no no get it right
[35:04] the white throne the bride does not
[35:09] stand before the white throne judgment
[35:12] but she stands before a judgment seat
[35:15] that even we'll judge angels the bible
[35:18] says
[35:20] all right suppose i do something to
[35:23] brother donnie
[35:26] i've explained this over and over and i
[35:28] i know how the human element works
[35:30] when i first do it i want to repent
[35:32] don't you i want to get rid of it
[35:34] but you know i let that go for a day or
[35:36] two
[35:38] and it just gets a little bit less
[35:40] problem
[35:42] until you know what happens now i'm
[35:45] explaining myself
[35:46] so you can listen you know what ends up
[35:48] happening
[35:50] i start blaming him for it
[35:57] right instead of my problem that i
[35:59] should be going to him to repent
[36:01] of what i'm doing i start blaming him
[36:03] and say he ought to come to me
[36:05] he doesn't mean he's done me wrong
[36:09] i'm just telling you what human beings
[36:12] will do
[36:13] and why we have to stand before the
[36:16] judgment seat of christ
[36:18] is because we will not straighten up
[36:24] something goes wrong we want to bypass
[36:26] it right
[36:27] we want to blame everybody else for our
[36:29] problems
[36:33] am i right no no no i've tried
[36:37] brother dale i i i've repented of
[36:42] godly sorrow is what worketh repentance
[36:45] according to the bible
[36:48] if you don't repent of your of something
[36:50] that you do wrong
[36:52] you're going to answer but now you're
[36:54] making it on whether or not i do
[36:56] anything
[36:56] no the bride does not go before the
[37:01] white throne judgment she does she will
[37:03] actually be sitting
[37:04] on the white throne judgment to judge
[37:06] others and will judge angels and
[37:08] everything
[37:09] she will be sitting beside of jesus
[37:11] christ and doing the judgment
[37:14] all right let's solve that enough
[37:17] all right but you say well what would it
[37:19] be the little things that we don't do
[37:25] go over there in galatians where
[37:28] talks about the the fruits of the spirit
[37:34] it talks about fruits of the spirit and
[37:36] then it talks about works of the flesh
[37:43] brother branham was was telling him
[37:45] about a little girl one day and he said
[37:48] she done this so and so way back a long
[37:50] time ago
[37:53] and said god's holding that against her
[38:00] see if we don't repent being a christian
[38:04] doesn't make you to the point that you
[38:05] don't have to repent
[38:07] being a christian should make us to the
[38:08] point we ought to want to repent more
[38:10] daily
[38:12] more and more ever we ought to repent
[38:14] every moment we ought to cry out all the
[38:16] time god forgive me
[38:18] help me but it's the little things
[38:24] is that what the bible says the little
[38:26] foxes is what falls the vines
[38:33] so you see there'd be things in our life
[38:35] that we don't think that we owe it
[38:37] like i said you tell me that i'm wrong
[38:39] i'll argue either to
[38:41] and we won't talk about going home we'll
[38:43] be here month after month
[38:44] because i ain't going to break down on
[38:46] that one thing i'm a human being and
[38:48] i've done it and i know you have
[38:53] that when it first starts i've done the
[38:54] dirty brother donny's
[38:56] no problem but after a while if i don't
[38:58] get that
[38:59] right attitude within myself i'll start
[39:02] blaming him
[39:04] i'll start putting it on him and after a
[39:06] while i'll have it so justified
[39:08] until i didn't even do nothing wrong i'm
[39:11] a sweet goody good
[39:13] he ordered he ought to thank me for that
[39:21] am right
[39:24] am i right am i am i telling it the way
[39:27] that it is
[39:29] that it's the little things it's not
[39:31] something that's a decision of eternal
[39:33] life or not
[39:34] that's settled by the new birth
[39:37] you're not being judged there for
[39:39] whether or not to go to heaven
[39:44] it's a judgment and i can't explain that
[39:46] to totally
[39:47] i've been asked where would that take
[39:48] place i don't know i don't know the
[39:50] placing of it
[39:52] i just know that the bible says it and
[39:54] the prophet said it that you're going to
[39:56] give an account
[39:57] right well i thought i was born again
[40:01] i thought the born-again spirit took
[40:02] care of everything
[40:04] yeah that's like one brother used to
[40:06] preach here with me years ago and i
[40:07] tried my
[40:08] for over and over and over to try to get
[40:10] him to see but he said if you're
[40:12] born again said it takes care of all
[40:14] your marital problems
[40:18] he did he tried to teach it right here
[40:23] he said that takes care of all of your
[40:25] marital problems and everything
[40:26] i said no sir
[40:30] i said the new birth does not take care
[40:32] of your marital problem
[40:33] that would make adulteries and stuff
[40:35] like that being in the wrong place
[40:40] that's why we got to keep a clean slate
[40:43] right
[40:46] why would it not why would a christian
[40:48] not want to have a clean slate
[40:51] that's my point that's my point the
[40:54] whole point of all of the things of
[40:55] saying it
[40:58] why would i not want a cleanse flight
[41:01] well i don't want people to know that
[41:02] i'd
[41:03] i've done that
[41:07] well i certainly dread to get rid of it
[41:11] here
[41:12] than to stand there before
[41:17] the ones i've done it with
[41:21] do you understand do you understand if
[41:23] we're going to sit at a judgment seat
[41:27] if there's going to be a judgment seat
[41:29] somebody's going to sit on the seat and
[41:31] judge
[41:31] and somebody's going to be standing in
[41:32] front of being judged now not to decide
[41:35] whether or not you're going to eternal
[41:37] life no way
[41:39] no that's where they put it we must all
[41:43] appear before the judgment seat of
[41:46] christ
[41:47] that everyone may receive the things
[41:50] done
[41:51] in his done in his body
[41:54] according to that he hath done whether
[41:57] it be good
[41:58] or bad
[42:03] well i i felt being a christian took
[42:05] care of all sin
[42:12] the bible says and the prophet
[42:16] says that the bride is the only one that
[42:19] can sin
[42:22] where have you been
[42:26] that's been taught to you from this
[42:27] pulpit right here for 50 years
[42:35] come on
[42:39] where's it at where's this great thing
[42:43] that we call it christianity
[42:44] but yet we can go out and live like the
[42:46] devil and say well
[42:48] that wasn't me that was that was my old
[42:51] body
[42:52] that done that i wasn't guilty and next
[42:55] week i'll do it again
[42:56] now yeah why don't you go down and pay
[42:58] the pope and you don't you don't have to
[42:59] fool
[43:00] running around so much you
[43:03] what do you mean brother i mean if if
[43:05] you can get by with it by
[43:07] just a confession of of a point or even
[43:10] not a confession
[43:11] then go pay the pope they believe that i
[43:14] don't
[43:15] that's right i don't believe that'll
[43:18] take care of our problems
[43:23] i believe we're going to give it a given
[43:25] account for what we do in this world
[43:27] right if i lie to you then what would it
[43:30] be
[43:31] if i steal from you what would it be
[43:35] yeah but i'm a christian i don't do
[43:39] well why don't you do it
[43:42] now you're saying you're a christian and
[43:44] you will happen to
[43:46] one day have to admit it maybe you won't
[43:49] hear
[43:50] but one day you'll have to admit that
[43:52] you was wrong
[43:54] right do you understand what i'm saying
[43:58] somewhere are you going to have to admit
[44:00] you was wrong
[44:02] all right i never heard christianity
[44:05] explain like that will you explain it
[44:08] you mean you got a right to just go out
[44:09] and sin
[44:11] only christians have sins right
[44:14] a sinner's condemned on a higher level
[44:16] he's condemned for being
[44:18] this sin but the christian
[44:23] is condemned for the sins we do the
[44:25] little
[44:26] little bitty things the little bitty
[44:27] foxes the little bitty points that we do
[44:30] the little lies we tell
[44:40] what about it
[44:43] the judgment of the deeds whether good
[44:46] or bad
[44:48] so evidently if you're going to be
[44:50] judged according to your deeds whether
[44:51] good or bad they must be a reward
[44:54] or a removing of a reward
[44:58] okay now look don't worry about it
[45:01] you're not going to stand there
[45:03] and be judged and lose your eternal life
[45:05] no no no now don't go running out in
[45:07] your mind
[45:08] you stand before the white throne
[45:10] judgment just remember
[45:12] only the sinners stand before this white
[45:14] throne judgment the bride don't stand
[45:16] before the white throne judgment
[45:17] she sets on the judgment with him
[45:21] judging others all right
[45:26] what about it what's your thoughts on
[45:30] that
[45:32] well brother there are you just making
[45:34] it worth it don't look like there's any
[45:35] hopes for any of us
[45:39] no i'm just trying to tell you what the
[45:40] bible says
[45:45] don't think you can go out and live like
[45:46] the devil
[45:49] and get by with it yeah but i've been a
[45:52] christian i've been
[45:54] i've been a preacher i've been this man
[45:58] i've
[46:04] you understand bride does not stand
[46:08] before the watch on judgment
[46:13] bride does not lose eternal life nowhere
[46:17] and to be cast into hell those that are
[46:21] cast into hell are those that would
[46:22] not correct in this life
[46:26] their lives as sinners not people of
[46:30] bride that are born again because
[46:32] if you're born again you're going to try
[46:33] your best to get straight
[46:36] right you're going to have a repentant
[46:40] attitude you're going to have an
[46:41] attitude about it
[46:43] of godly sorrow
[46:49] you don't have that attitude or that
[46:51] thought well
[46:54] you might not be born again
[47:01] you know you just might not be born
[47:03] again
[47:07] i want everything straight what was the
[47:09] old saying i don't want no trouble when
[47:10] you get down at the river
[47:13] anybody thoughts or comments uh first
[47:16] timothy 5
[47:17] 24 says some men's sins are open
[47:19] beforehand going before the judgment
[47:22] and some men they follow after right so
[47:24] if you don't get it straight here you're
[47:26] gonna have to give an account for
[47:27] anything but if you get it straight here
[47:28] you don't have to carry it there
[47:30] exactly that's what timothy was saying
[47:31] some men are open beforehand in other
[47:33] words you've confessed it and got it
[47:35] over with
[47:36] but some are going to follow you if you
[47:38] don't it's going to follow you exactly
[47:39] that judgment that he's talking about
[47:41] right here right not a white throne
[47:43] judgment but that judgment exactly
[47:44] because the whole scripture right here
[47:46] talking about christian right talking
[47:47] about christian people
[47:48] see there's two judgments right exactly
[47:52] wipe your own judgment and the judgment
[47:55] of the deeds done in the body whether
[47:56] good or bad
[48:01] that's two judgments that satire you can
[48:03] appear at
[48:04] one or the other but just remember
[48:08] forever sin i love this is what i love
[48:11] you know everything that i repent of
[48:14] i can't be brought that up again
[48:17] i mean true repentance he's really sorry
[48:20] you know god will never bring that again
[48:22] because he puts it in the sea of
[48:23] forgiveless
[48:24] and he'll never bring it up to you
[48:29] you may have to answer for other things
[48:32] but you'll never have to answer for that
[48:34] that's what i love because it's pure and
[48:37] clean
[48:38] but that keeps me as repentant as i can
[48:40] be
[48:41] to say i'm sorry
[48:44] lord i'm sorry
[48:48] i just want to do what's right
[48:51] anybody else brother ryan
[49:11] about question uh i have a question
[49:13] about gifts and callings
[49:16] brother dale how did you know you were
[49:17] called to preach and then how would
[49:19] especially a new christian find their
[49:22] gift or calling
[49:26] first off how did i know
[49:30] well
[49:36] to be truthful to you
[49:40] even back when i was a sinner
[49:44] that's the reason i can preach on the
[49:45] gifts
[49:48] and try to place them in order and
[49:49] believe it
[49:52] the prophet made the statement one day
[49:54] he said
[49:55] that's just the way it was said some of
[49:57] you were just a little different
[50:01] remember that some of you were just a
[50:04] little different
[50:07] you ever thought about what kept you
[50:09] from doing wrong
[50:13] you ever thought about what kept you
[50:14] from lying and cheating stealing you
[50:16] know
[50:17] i was a kid maybe you don't know but i'm
[50:18] talking about big things
[50:24] what kept you when others
[50:28] around you went after all of those
[50:29] things
[50:35] see something was dealing with me all
[50:37] the time
[50:40] knew that
[50:44] but there was no way to express it to
[50:45] anyone because
[50:48] i never found anybody that had any
[50:52] understanding
[50:56] you've heard me tell the story that i
[50:57] met god when i was 11 years old in a
[50:59] baptist church i seen him standing there
[51:03] not as a form not as he's six foot
[51:05] taller now i saw a form
[51:08] but i knew it was almighty god
[51:12] and i searched for that god
[51:16] all through my life
[51:20] i read as much as i could i was done i
[51:23] studied the bible
[51:24] things you talking about a calling
[51:30] you see one day it just began to click
[51:33] after becoming a christian after coming
[51:36] in this message
[51:37] after being born again that would have
[51:39] thrown me on over into life about
[51:41] somewhere in the neighborhood of 33 30
[51:44] years of age we'll say
[51:47] things started working a little
[51:48] different
[51:51] and i seen that there was a gift
[51:56] that i had but i've seen what the
[51:58] prophet said you can't depend on gifts
[52:01] because everybody can have a gift
[52:05] so it couldn't be that it couldn't be
[52:06] this that gift
[52:12] but it was something was different
[52:20] and i guess the thing that always held
[52:22] me to be different was one thing
[52:27] i've always believed the word
[52:30] to be god's word
[52:34] sure we were baptist sure
[52:38] we didn't understand a lot of things but
[52:41] i still believed it to be god
[52:44] and that's where i read it and studied
[52:45] it
[52:48] i cried out before god to find an answer
[52:51] for what this was that was bothering me
[52:56] i've never explained my whole christian
[52:58] experience
[53:03] but yet it was just something real
[53:09] when other people talked about god they
[53:11] talked about him off you under her back
[53:13] back there
[53:14] over there i begin to see him right here
[53:19] where we're at walking with us
[53:24] and dwelling with us
[53:27] yeah something was different
[53:34] i didn't lie cheat steal
[53:40] it was just something i didn't do
[53:46] i didn't make it on the basis of
[53:48] christianity to say i didn't do those
[53:50] things
[53:52] but i just make it on the basis that you
[53:53] don't have to do it
[53:56] i put it back to you you don't have to
[53:59] do wrong
[54:04] i'm living proof that you don't have to
[54:07] do wrong
[54:10] but as the word begin to unfold brother
[54:12] moat trying to help me
[54:14] he said i don't understand you said
[54:17] i said i don't understand at all
[54:22] he said quit trying to figure these
[54:23] things out and just accept god for what
[54:26] it is
[54:27] i said well i guess that's the best way
[54:29] to do it that's i at least got an
[54:30] answer but you see still nobody could
[54:33] bring me to that
[54:35] one that i met in that building in that
[54:37] church
[54:42] and as time went on brother moat said
[54:44] well you you're
[54:45] you're ministering i said no i said i'm
[54:48] a deacon i said i can out to teach i
[54:50] said
[54:51] we can do services i'll take care of
[54:53] things you know
[54:55] you know how it started here we started
[54:57] with the services he and i
[54:59] he was the pastor and i was just his
[55:04] assistant
[55:06] but i began to see the word just keep
[55:08] unfolding
[55:11] it unfolded to a place
[55:17] to where i could see what was going on
[55:24] did that make you anything no that's
[55:27] what i'm trying to explain
[55:30] the more you think of yourself as being
[55:32] something and less the fact that you are
[55:34] maybe that didn't come out right but the
[55:37] less of the fact that you really are
[55:38] anything the best way to find out
[55:41] whether anything is just be the worst
[55:43] read the least of all and say god help
[55:46] me
[55:51] but you see back there i was i loved the
[55:54] word
[55:55] i told my wife you've heard me tell it i
[55:57] told my wife i said it the way the bible
[55:59] looks it'll be
[56:00] there'll be two prophets come before the
[56:02] end of the world
[56:03] malachi 3 malachi 4. see we baptist
[56:07] could handle malachi 3.
[56:10] because the bible tells you you know
[56:11] about the john and the coming and what
[56:13] it was to do
[56:14] and and the things that was to take
[56:15] place of uh
[56:17] excuse me with malachite three but it
[56:19] would be luke
[56:20] 117 right through there we could pick up
[56:24] and understand a little bit about
[56:28] john
[56:30] but before i even become into the
[56:32] message or anything i could see that
[56:34] there was something about that it looked
[56:37] looked real so when brother moat said
[56:40] you ever heard of
[56:41] said if you you believed in prophets
[56:43] said we'd we do because he knew the
[56:45] baptist baptists will take
[56:46] teachers or sometimes they want pastors
[56:50] and they will handle the evangelists but
[56:53] the prophets and the apostles
[56:55] is out for them they won't take that
[56:58] part of the ministry
[57:00] but you see that was the thing he said
[57:02] he said
[57:05] what do you think about this malachi 4
[57:11] i said what are you telling me about
[57:12] malachi 3
[57:16] well he proceeded to explain it to me
[57:20] you say part of my experience is what
[57:21] i'm trying to explain you ask the point
[57:23] i'm trying to explain part of my
[57:25] experience how do i know
[57:32] and see as remote proceeded to explain
[57:37] what was to transpire under malachi 4.
[57:40] i had no troubles
[57:45] that was where you've heard me tell the
[57:46] story that he asked me said what do you
[57:47] believe on the god head
[57:49] i said one true and living god god in
[57:51] three persons blessed trinity because
[57:52] that was the only way i could explain it
[57:54] i had no way of explaining that was a
[57:56] baptist explaining baptists believe in
[57:58] one god
[58:00] but they explained it as god in three
[58:02] persons blessed trinity
[58:05] he said your trinity just like anybody
[58:06] else i said please explain yourself sir
[58:10] he explained it when he got through
[58:11] explaining to one god
[58:13] i said i don't believe that no more
[58:17] i don't believe in three gods no more
[58:20] ain't got no more problems with that
[58:23] that's straightened out
[58:29] come in the message and begin to study
[58:31] the message and
[58:34] preaching on things and talking to
[58:37] people about things and talking about
[58:39] daniel 70 weeks and
[58:41] the seals and the things when others
[58:44] seem to be scared
[58:48] brother moak could handle seal one two
[58:50] three four
[58:52] and jump and pick up six i'm telling you
[58:55] the truth now i'm not
[58:56] throwing off on him and he helped me to
[58:59] bring me through
[59:00] all of those things but he could never
[59:03] see
[59:04] seven and five he couldn't put them
[59:05] together he couldn't
[59:07] because he told me he said brother
[59:09] around said you know that one seal will
[59:11] tie the entire bible together he said
[59:12] brother dale i don't see that
[59:15] i said well i'm beginning to
[59:19] because one seal is one true and living
[59:20] god
[59:22] and that'll tie all the seals together
[59:25] but see as time went on i'm saying this
[59:28] back when i was a
[59:30] deacon talking and preaching and
[59:33] teaching sunday school
[59:35] but never confessed that i was a
[59:37] minister
[59:39] i would never confess that that i was a
[59:44] preacher
[59:46] i waited and waited and waited and then
[59:48] one day it just opened
[59:51] the words you've wrought is the proof of
[59:54] where you are
[59:57] that's the thing that i've taught you
[1:00:02] what i've taught you as a congregation
[1:00:05] is one thing
[1:00:07] what you are is the word of god
[1:00:12] for the hour and the time that you're
[1:00:14] living
[1:00:16] that's the proof of it going how do you
[1:00:19] know you're called to preach
[1:00:25] because it comes to a basis that the
[1:00:27] word unfolded
[1:00:30] until i had to deny no word i didn't
[1:00:33] have anything
[1:00:34] to deny of any of the word the prophet
[1:00:37] brought
[1:00:38] and defended it over and over and my
[1:00:40] whole purpose in life since i've been in
[1:00:42] the message is to defend the fact
[1:00:44] of like when everybody didn't want to
[1:00:46] preach daniel 70 weeks that was the
[1:00:48] thing i wanted to preach
[1:00:49] when they didn't want to preach the
[1:00:50] seals that was the thing that i wanted
[1:00:52] to preach
[1:00:54] because i wanted to try to help people
[1:00:56] to understand
[1:00:57] and as i did it began to put it and it
[1:01:00] put it to the bases that i can stand
[1:01:02] here now and say
[1:01:03] i haven't ever had anybody that attacked
[1:01:05] it
[1:01:07] oh they don't believe it i mean come and
[1:01:10] attacked it
[1:01:14] come and show me where i missed it
[1:01:22] paul do you know where you are
[1:01:27] the word whereof i'm called
[1:01:32] paul had a message to bring that was his
[1:01:35] calling to preach
[1:01:36] now that's exactly what i've explained
[1:01:38] to you in 15 minutes or so
[1:01:43] the prophet had a message to bring the
[1:01:46] message he had to bring
[1:01:47] was his call to the ministry
[1:01:56] that's why i'm so adamant of preaching
[1:01:58] about the fifo ministry
[1:02:01] is because the fifo ministry has
[1:02:06] their calling is to preach what the
[1:02:08] prophet brought
[1:02:11] that's their calling what do you if you
[1:02:13] want to know whether you call to preach
[1:02:14] or not
[1:02:15] what do you do with the word
[1:02:20] see what it does
[1:02:26] hey don't worry about it give some
[1:02:28] callings or route repentance
[1:02:31] god will straighten us up do it
[1:02:34] but then when you come to a basis that i
[1:02:37] wanted to quit i did one time
[1:02:39] brother mulff was here he'd like and
[1:02:41] tell it
[1:02:43] i quit preaching
[1:02:46] he said what we're going to do i said
[1:02:47] well i can teach sunday school to do
[1:02:49] something you know
[1:02:50] services that came here you can't house
[1:02:52] but i'm just going to sit down a while
[1:02:54] he said why i said because i brought
[1:02:57] to the congregation my thoughts and
[1:02:59] ideas
[1:03:01] of as much as i can understand they're
[1:03:03] into your hands
[1:03:08] he said well i don't know i said we
[1:03:11] believe praying for the sick i said
[1:03:13] we'll
[1:03:13] we'll get by
[1:03:18] you see that it took many years
[1:03:21] for me to realize that there was no way
[1:03:23] to sit down and stop
[1:03:26] because what had started a good work
[1:03:27] would finish it
[1:03:29] paul what is your call to the ministry
[1:03:31] the word were of i'm called
[1:03:35] brother dale what is your call to the
[1:03:36] ministry
[1:03:38] to follow the prophet's message
[1:03:42] to every degree that i can and ideas i
[1:03:45] could have
[1:03:47] is my call
[1:03:52] see that way it's not gifts it's not
[1:03:53] somebody hollering out of a tree
[1:03:55] that you're called to preach or somebody
[1:03:57] talk you know telling you
[1:03:58] it's god just using his gift
[1:04:03] to keep bringing it
[1:04:06] i made a statement in a minister's
[1:04:08] meeting years ago
[1:04:11] and i still don't back up
[1:04:15] i said none of you have added one word
[1:04:17] to what i've taught
[1:04:23] they didn't like that i'm sure but it
[1:04:26] was a true
[1:04:27] you say well why are you telling us
[1:04:28] because it was the truth
[1:04:32] they'd done the best they could do and i
[1:04:33] appreciate it you don't understand this
[1:04:34] old boy
[1:04:35] i went back to the baptist church and or
[1:04:37] didn't go back a man come down
[1:04:39] i thanked him for helping me and doing
[1:04:41] everything he could do to help me
[1:04:42] to line up in a christian life
[1:04:46] i had to do that twice in this message
[1:04:47] in gainesville had i went to the brother
[1:04:49] and i said brother i appreciate you
[1:04:51] i appreciate everything you've done
[1:04:53] you've done you've helped me you
[1:04:54] you've done i told brother molt over and
[1:04:56] over i said you've helped me you've
[1:04:58] brought me to this
[1:04:59] and this station that i stand today is
[1:05:01] sitting on the basis of what i believe
[1:05:03] about
[1:05:03] what you've taught
[1:05:06] i talked to a minister down in athens
[1:05:09] and
[1:05:10] thanked him why because i thank god for
[1:05:12] all the people
[1:05:14] that have tried to help me and try to do
[1:05:16] whether it be good or bad whether it be
[1:05:18] hard or rough whether it be something
[1:05:19] rough or
[1:05:20] or just telling you how rough it is or
[1:05:22] just telling you how far how far you are
[1:05:24] off or whatever
[1:05:25] that's why you always hear me saying
[1:05:27] come on let's talk
[1:05:28] right let's sit down and talk
[1:05:34] let's see what god has to say
[1:05:39] see because i know gifts and callings
[1:05:41] are without repentance i didn't repent
[1:05:43] to get a gift i didn't do that
[1:05:45] but repentance activated the gift
[1:05:52] that's why i didn't preach that that you
[1:05:54] always was eternal because i didn't
[1:05:56] believe it and i've never taught it that
[1:05:57] way but i know something was always
[1:06:02] there
[1:06:06] i'd walk in the woods
[1:06:09] and know somebody was walking with me
[1:06:18] i'd pray and cry out knowing somebody
[1:06:22] was there but sometimes he wouldn't be
[1:06:25] too close
[1:06:29] he had to let me fight it out
[1:06:33] to know paul what is your call the word
[1:06:37] whereof i'm called to preach the mystery
[1:06:41] come on the title today mystery of his
[1:06:44] will
[1:06:48] see if you're a minister you have a
[1:06:52] mystery a part of the mystery you don't
[1:06:54] have all of it we're not
[1:06:55] not in the basis of that come on
[1:06:58] these ministers they have a mystery
[1:07:01] they've never thought of it maybe as to
[1:07:03] what i'm saying to this day
[1:07:05] but a mystery a part of god's word
[1:07:10] is they have to bring that you remember
[1:07:13] this
[1:07:14] statement i've always made to you and
[1:07:16] tried to get you i said what is your
[1:07:17] calling in the bible
[1:07:21] what is your scripture that you hold
[1:07:23] true with your life in
[1:07:25] in reality more than you do of anything
[1:07:27] else what is it
[1:07:28] how many times do i ask you that
[1:07:31] but how many times have i told you
[1:07:37] that when i saw it in the bible i saw
[1:07:41] there would be two prophets
[1:07:47] come before the end of the world i
[1:07:49] couldn't get john the baptist i could
[1:07:51] get that straight we had that working
[1:07:53] but we couldn't do it with malachi 4.
[1:07:56] that was a mystery for the end time
[1:07:59] brother branham what is your calling to
[1:08:00] preach
[1:08:03] a prophet listen a prophet
[1:08:07] in the bible a man that the first thing
[1:08:10] he can remember is a
[1:08:12] vision at 18 months of age
[1:08:18] but brother brown and what is your
[1:08:19] calling he said there's a mystery
[1:08:26] paul had a mystery and he had to explain
[1:08:28] it
[1:08:30] there's a mystery that i've got to
[1:08:32] explain he said
[1:08:35] the mystery is the bride of jesus christ
[1:08:38] becoming one with god
[1:08:41] that was his mystery that was his
[1:08:43] message what did he always preach
[1:08:45] go to 63 and go on through the message
[1:08:47] and listen
[1:08:48] and see if he didn't cover every message
[1:08:51] something about the what you are
[1:08:56] what god has made you
[1:09:03] you can see his mystery his mystery was
[1:09:06] to type
[1:09:07] all mysteries that's why it says in in
[1:09:10] revelations 10
[1:09:13] where the mystery of god would be
[1:09:16] complete it doesn't say mysteries
[1:09:18] it says mystery one mystery singular
[1:09:20] brother random had one mystery one
[1:09:23] god and man becoming one
[1:09:28] that was his mystery that's what he
[1:09:31] wanted to see
[1:09:33] that's what i want to see
[1:09:36] how do i know that i'm called to preach
[1:09:38] because
[1:09:42] there's something inside of me the bible
[1:09:46] says you know how
[1:09:46] know what the fire that's built inside
[1:09:48] of you
[1:09:56] it's a mystery
[1:09:59] how many services have i preached on the
[1:10:02] mystery of god
[1:10:08] because that's what it is that's my call
[1:10:13] but how do you know because you you say
[1:10:16] that you never had a voice talk to you
[1:10:17] or anything like that
[1:10:18] no
[1:10:22] but i just watched him
[1:10:26] work his way
[1:10:30] for 50 years i've watched him
[1:10:33] work his way
[1:10:38] to try to guide a church into the word
[1:10:40] of god
[1:10:44] that is the mystery okay
[1:10:48] now what was the other part about the i
[1:10:51] think i got about five minutes
[1:10:52] you covered it all but uh i think you
[1:10:55] covered it all but i was the other part
[1:10:56] was uh how would a young christian
[1:10:58] especially find their gift or calling
[1:11:00] but he really covered it
[1:11:01] all right i'll tell you this way just
[1:11:04] like i told my own son
[1:11:06] if you ever think in any way that you're
[1:11:08] called to preach
[1:11:10] run
[1:11:13] no no i'm going to go help oh you're
[1:11:15] going to go help god
[1:11:17] oh glory you're going to help god
[1:11:22] he don't need me and you
[1:11:26] we need him
[1:11:29] well i'm trying to explain gifts even
[1:11:31] playing the instruments and things
[1:11:33] see god give you those gifts use them
[1:11:36] for his glory and honor
[1:11:39] and he moves you up into the body of
[1:11:41] gifts of nine spiritual gifts
[1:11:43] wisdom knowledge temperance you know all
[1:11:45] kinds of things
[1:11:48] but then he moves up into what we moved
[1:11:49] up to into the fifo ministry to cover
[1:11:51] the faithful ministry
[1:11:52] where they're a special group of people
[1:11:54] that it's not the man that comes
[1:11:56] predestinated eternally but it's the
[1:11:57] gift or calling that was within his life
[1:12:01] that gift
[1:12:05] is the word of god
[1:12:08] and then finalizing it with bringing the
[1:12:10] prophet because he could cover
[1:12:11] all gifts
[1:12:16] he had the word of god for our age
[1:12:19] that's why that it hurts me to hear
[1:12:22] ministers after preaching 20 30 40 years
[1:12:24] old
[1:12:25] and then hear them fall away
[1:12:32] you just cry
[1:12:39] anybody else see anything i forgot just
[1:12:41] a minute
[1:12:50] all right just come ahead musicians and
[1:12:52] let's just go ahead
[1:12:57] we'll pick this part up and just bring
[1:13:00] it into the message
[1:13:01] part going through from
[1:13:04] from today with this but i hope you i
[1:13:07] hope you pay
[1:13:08] attention to one thing my honor and
[1:13:11] glory
[1:13:14] all goes to jesus christ
[1:13:18] whatever you got your gifts
[1:13:21] your musicians you your song leaders
[1:13:23] your your
[1:13:24] your jobs and things your mystery
[1:13:28] is involved in your life serve god
[1:13:32] out of joy not out of a have to
[1:13:38] make it a happy thing
[1:13:42] let your family know that there's
[1:13:45] something
[1:13:46] that you wanting them to see about god
[1:13:52] i'm talking about men women children let
[1:13:54] god
[1:13:55] let god rule us or move us
[1:14:00] and let god be known through our hearts
[1:14:03] and lives that others may see
[1:14:06] and then you'll come out of it at least
[1:14:08] of one thing what is the one thing you
[1:14:09] do
[1:14:10] when you walk up to brother dale and you
[1:14:11] say well how are you doing
[1:14:15] what does it say well
[1:14:20] if i told you how i felt you'd take me
[1:14:22] to the emergency room
[1:14:25] if i told you exactly like it was going
[1:14:27] on you'd take me to the undertaker
[1:14:33] but you see to talk about him as he
[1:14:37] really is
[1:14:38] is my joy in life about christ
