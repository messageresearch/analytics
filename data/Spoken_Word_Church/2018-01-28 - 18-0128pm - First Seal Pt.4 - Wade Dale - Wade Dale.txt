won't have to we won't have to fight [Applause] that devil has wrote off and light Richard said we put the thing downstairs to throw away and it fell over and knocked the trashcan lid off so it's still alive down there doing something though we'll get rid of that thing one of these days but we have a new one and I got some new little pens to write with and a new little eraser so we got everything up here we need some it's good to be good to be to be able to get some of these things that we need so so just keep us in your prayers now remember the banquet I want to remind you now if you've been to the banquet find out your 10 year picture and bring it with you for the for the Valentine's banquet with your billing with 17 it will be gray background and I think a silver silver frame so let's bring those and see how much we've changed see how much better-looking we've got in 10 years so also February 25th remember I'll be going to a Mobile Alabama to minister for brother Matthew brace I'll just keep us in your prayers and also we have a the DVDs came from brother Tim hymns that we did in October both services so if you'd like to have one if you want to raise your hand so we can kind of figure out how many we need to and me we need to make 1112 we'll just make 20 copies yeah we'll just make 20 copies cuz some people not here if you want to see it you're sure welcome to it it's both services they came in the mail the other day so we have those for you to review if if you wish so just keep that do we have a DVD maker machine Richard we do ok so Richard says yes he's Shane is that so yes we do so we'll be able to to make those DVDs not it's not just the audio it is the DVD so also remember that March 21st through April the 3rd I'll be going to the Philippines Lewis and Christine I'm not going to be able to go been in prayer for the past week and I just really never felt comfortable with it's not that I don't feel comfortable with Jim going with me but I've just never felt comfortable with her going over there with me and taking that much of the money out because there's a brother already paid for her ticket to go the the money was there but but we're going to leave her here and and I've got a two-week agenda that's pretty full so I don't want to be dragging her around but I've been praying all week and finally I think Wednesday night the Lord spoke to him and told me that that she needs to stay here at this time so I hate that but they'll fit the Lord's will I want her to stay here and in that way he won't have to it's a rough trip 20 something mile flight two weeks not knowing you know I mean she'd be just as home with anywhere else but still traveling and all those things like that so so just keeps any prayers I'll be the only ones going now so well but we do have an agenda brother royal sent me a message that they're already there at Mount Pinatubo doing a mission work they're saying now that the church is going to have to be bigger because they already have over a hundred people wanting to accept the message and be baptized so where they're going to try to raise some more funds about another two or three thousand dollars to finish the building but a structure will be thin by March the 31st so we'll be able to go and dedicate it so dedicate it for you guys because um the funds all come from you but if you got anything else that you want to give feel free to give it a sister release or myself whichever way you want to do it so let's go to the Lord in prayer revelation 6 verse 1 and 2 definitely father we thank you for this day Lord that we can gather enough house where it's comfortable and we have a roof over a head Lord we think many times of the people in the early ages that met in homes and stables and closed in places that were not very comfortable but the Word of God was in great power and the Word of God went forth in a new church or a new body was being built called the Bride of Christ in the New Testament and they didn't worry about whether it was too cold or too hot or if they had enough to eat or if it was comfortable they just wanted to hear from you lord I pray that we have that same attitude that we want to hear from you Lord and not let any external things happen you take over this service Lord you'd be the active participant the one doing the speaking one doing their hearing Lord healed the sick save the lost be with the ones that are on the highways be with sister Janet Lord if she's up there in the hospital just touch the hands of the of the doctors Lord him she'll be fine with that procedure tomorrow brother Daugherty and all the ones that are not with us Lord with president should be with them just blessed Lord the missionaries on the foreign fields we always pray Lord that you'll give them fruit for the labor Lord and bless them and keep them safe forgive us of our sins Lord we're totally unworthy to be standing here but you've made us worthy through the blood of Jesus Christ just be with us now take care of us in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him out of bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading of the word we're gonna get this nice new thing out here and I get that oh I got it yeah I got it I won't have to the leg ain't sticking out so I can get this one see look how pretty it's all matte black see brother rush look see this I seen him with the brother of Minnesota I've seen him a text whatever not it was Friday night or whenever it was we got this we were in Office Depot and he sent a big old tapes big old letters - thank you Jesus and now I have broke it y'all think I'm kidding I need a knife and I don't know what there we go Hey look at that that's pretty fun this one's different than the other one this one should last at least the two services look at that tada now I have to run up here and good to see brother David back with us today how you doing man good to see you good to see you all right do there and that cute you don't see that I know T said y'all can't hardly see it in the back but blessed is he that didn't see and believe so you in the back here in the back you believe what you can't see a scripture all right so now let's start and begin will overview this in a minute but let's put back number 1 on the board from the sixth seal and let's kind of get a background again I hope last Sunday was was was a help that showed you the the seal was like Bob was talking about will and I never said it but it's exactly what it is there's twins and everything there's twins it's just you got Cain and Abel you got guarding the devil you got you know you got Esau and Jacob and then you've got Jesus and Judas and now you've got the church in the bride and then you've got the church in the bride you got to you've got twins and every every revival so here we go and let's just look at this real quick number one brother I'm sending the sixth seal and Isaiah let's take this Isaiah the prophet seemed this sixth seal open and spoke of it that's whether it's important or not well the whole thing the whole plan of redemption weighs under those seals the whole book now watch he says lays under those seals all right so it lays under the seal the seal being what we were talking about last Sunday this is the seal this is one had it sealed up that what that Christ that many men even the prophet of God in the first part of their ministry this was all the Holy Ghost in the first part and many many commentaries this you know it says the white horse is the purity of God and it's the Holy Ghost and it's a bow shooting the Cupid's arrows and you know how brother bottom explained all that crammed in then we come up and see when the seal broke we we saw it was totally opposite totally opposite none of this has anything to do with God this is not Christ this is not Christ this is not Christ this is not Christ but as we were talking about last Sunday that to have a white horse rider you had to have in the first three church ages you had to have a righteous church as Bob was saying this morning's under schooner he's doing a good job there with birth pains because it's showing two births there but you got to see the opposite there is no way that Satan has ever originated anything he always has to wait on God now why would you want to follow somebody that followed somebody why would you want to follow somebody that follow somebody we want to follow Christ amen we want to follow the originator because this is not original this is a copy off of the original as we showed here that Satan had a bow in allows but God's got the sword of his word amen and he give it to me in you amen and this sword of the word like we were talking about last Sunday this sort of the word had no denominational idea in it whatsoever now there were sayings we're gonna talk about that in just a little while there were little things that were already coming as Paul says in Thessalonians he said he said the one who's now working in other words he was excuse me he was working there now remember we crown him King of Kings Satan put that crown on his head cuz the Bible said the crown was given all right and then he went forth conquering in to conquer and what did he conquer he started out with a little saying now look the way God starts out Satan copies right we got that down so we see that God has went out and in the first three Church ages watch how he works because you see the plan of redemption and now Lord you ought to be able to see the plan of redemption all the way back to Adam and Eve and even before the fall like that was saying this morning I you know you don't think the planes like that but but Adam never went through a justified condition he never went to a sanctifying condition he was just imparted to baptism of the Holy Ghost he was given the Holy Ghost all right to be the first son but now as we have fell this is what we're going to look at the mystery of iniquity the man you have to get this because when we fail that brought a whole new meaning to what God was doing now not what God's doing listen God never changes we change so God never changes his his plan was the same all along man his times plan never changed his plans stayed the same it's just what we did is we adjusted to it but watch what happened Satan did the same thing he saw a white righteous church walk out with a with the power and anointing of the Holy Ghost doing the work and Satan said I think I'll just slide in there and get I'm not going to go to the bar I'm not gonna bring more prostitution I'm going to bring more church members I'm gonna get on a seemingly a white horse now remember these are symbols you'll never see Satan riding a white horse you got that but John saw in symbolic remember we read it last Sunday and sympathies are all symbols to show me in you something all right excuse me I've got me some water so looked up so there must be a plan of redemption now when we get into this mystery of iniquity is something that really help me is the problem and if you'll look 263 times the Bible talks about iniquity 240 of them are in the Old Testament so almost 3/4 of them are in the Old Testament they're talking about iniquity there's not so much iniquity brought out in the New Testament why because we're going to see today I hope just by reading the Bible that that we got trapped because of Adam's iniquity and then so what happens is as we still and you do too and I do too we still think that things got us so bound we can't get out of it that's the mystery of iniquity because we're going to read it the mystery of iniquity is it's worth hung into this thing right here because remember there was no iniquity and Adam soul atom soul was this perfect just God and if you're born again today your soul is just as perfect as God it's not doesn't have iniquity iniquities not found in us in our soul ok but well now what are we working on redemption of the body redemption on the outside guy getting that getting the spirit realm to where we don't just talk about iniquity being done away with there's a difference in talking about something being done away with and you know what something's been done away with a man like when many times when we come up to the to the new birth and we're going to talk about justification next Sunday and in a way that that mirrors what you did in the first part but remember I can remember the things I used to do I didn't do it anymore I had no desire to do that but I knew it wasn't born again because it always kept leaning back toward that why because that thing inside of me was still there a man that mystery of iniquity was still working because remember your iniquity was found in who Satan so he's the author of iniquity he's the number one guy when it to that because remember he was how in the world can you stand and look at the man that created you and think you're better than him how can you do that well so that's what Satan did he said you I didn't bring it but in Hezekiah's since you were made perfect until iniquity was found in you hey man God made him perfect God didn't make him so Satan he brings iniquity out and God's hates it so much though well we will read it in the Old Testament but that iniquities got to be done away with and there's only one way that an equity can be done away with him we're going to read it here in a little while but let's go to the next one where we pulled up last Sunday where it says Redemption Redemption Redemption I want you to keep that plan of redemption breaking in the seals is not necessarily for the soul the soul is redeemed by the new birth the shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary but we'll bring full fellowship and I want to put back into manifestation because remember before the fall Adam had full complete fellowship with God there was no iniquity found in Adam at that time Satan had to come in and help that develop in Adam but not in Adam soul okay cuz remember there's only in that inside man faith or doubt not gray area in between but now in that second room you can have memory reason conscious affection imagination Satan can work through all five God can work through all five man and that's our problem because this body there's nothing wrong with this body now we're really we were born in sin shaping an iniquity we'll read that in a minute David knew that but we gotta have an out there's got to be an out or we're just going to keep like bob says with death is not shame by no means but I want to go on to perfection and I want to cross over that pass that I'm 58 now I'm getting closer all right let's go to the next one number two first steal we read these last Sunday but I just want to kind of read these and then we'll get on the mystery of iniquity all right number two the first seal Jeffersonville Indiana at the end of the pen coughs the blades we're supposed to receive according to the word god help us to not to show you through here that we are to see hey Bobby can you see that good that's Sunday school class he's got letters about that high poor old sister treating McMillan if she'd have been a giraffe she still would have been like she's trying to read and I was trying to read to you make big fonts so we can see there's that mystery of iniquity thank you we are to see we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapture of the church listen we should put all of our dependency listen not on what william brown said on paper but what he has give us is the entire Word of God back the way it should have been when Jesus was standing on the earth hey man no one else could do that but God Himself through a man amen but he give it to us to carry it on and then and then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders there's not even written at all in other words remember there's not one two three four five like the the seals it's revelation 6:1 and the first seal is and the second seal is and the third all the way down there's no scripture that says and the first under is and the second Thunder has got it but it has to be in the entire Bible that's why I say these thunders have to be something about Redemption because Redemption starts in Genesis and it ends in Revelation the whole thing we're going to read it look what Israel did to God Israel turn from God God said if you'll follow my statutes and my judgments so he said you'll never have a problem next king popped up he starts putting idols up next king comes up he takes the temple down next King comes up he puts the Groves up and he's put golden calves up he starts putting this up and gods like what's the deal you're committing iniquity that's why you see David in the Book of Psalms iniquities used two hundred times because he knew what that was and then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders there's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for right during faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do that right there's something we've got to step further hey man so we got a step further than what we have been stepping down through the church ages down to the church ages a church age messenger would come he would get the revelation that God give him he would bring it to the people and what would happen messenger will come at the end of the age he'd bring his message of what would go great for a while but all of a sudden what would happen he start curving down Satan would start injecting more and more and more and what happened brother Branham says about the time they all denominating died god what there's a porter standing here he brings a message to the next age lifts them up out of that church age brings a message of a spiritual war starch that's what's happening now we're not we're not fighting we're not fighting North Korea we're fighting demons and then and if there was no demons North Korea would be a nice place to live right so we're fighting demons are not fighting people all right let's go to number three revelations chapter five number two see what it's doing it's these seals opening up just begin to reveal the what the plan of redemption how he did it it's all over now just about just about finishing up so we're at the end time so that's why the things are being revealed now look like I said last Sunday if you'll remember there has to be something already there to be reveal you can't reveal nothing because there's nothing there to reveal and then so there's got to be something that has been hid it's there it's in here it's in here but it's got to be revealed it's already there that's my brother Brown they said oh you can write a 23rd chapter of Revelations he said sounds good but what would that be doing they'd be adding to what God's already wrote and said it is finished this is the it it's done all right so it's got to be contained in the Bible it's got to be contained in the Bible that's like the Daniel 70 weeks you know people can go all all the quotes and all the all the things and it sounds you know I say to you it sounds like brother Branham is contrary but the Bible is real plain seventy weeks are determined all right there's a one week period one week equal seven years there's a seven there's a 62 which is 69 now they ain't no halves in there right the Bible says what and he shall make a covenant with many for one week that's not three and a half years and when who is he he is not God because God don't make a covenant and break it so it's got to be this Antichrist that we're talking about and he shall make a covenant with many for one week now we do have to go back to the prophets message and realize you and I are not here when that Sun when this first seal opens in this I got it my nose and it's normal in its natural form we're not here and then collects the Israel revelation 6 it goes to them right and the man of sin sitting in temple of God we don't see that so who's that he he the Antichrist shall make a covenant with many for one week now help me add 7 plus 62 is what thank you 69 I'm glad you said that some of these others that they were but that's 69 no halves no quarters 69 and Christ was cut off what so then the Gentile bride could fit in 2,000 years then when we leave he shall make a covenant with many for how long one week so that's what we left after the rapture I don't care what anybody says that's the Bible face final resting places in that word people and brother branham being a word prophet he could not say anything different than that and man we're just not understanding what he is saying like brother Dale was talking about this morning he read a quote that seemed like in the same quote he was not contrary but come out at a different angle and that's okay if we come out at a different angle but it was the same thing once you got finished and that's the same thing with Daniel 7 weeks you can take all the quotes you can take all the things you want to but the Bible says there's a seven week to 62 week and one week that's 70 weeks not no halves in there anywhere because people in the message say that that we've only got three and a half years of Daniel seventy weeks which that's not true according to the Bible according the prophets message so but now that mystery of iniquity of iniquity is working we think all that mystery of iniquity is in denomination come on people it's out yonder in them denomination now why would he be out there when the perfection is in here I thought it was so close I didn't think it was so far away that's why I see Satan's not going to get us with a father son Holy Ghost baptism he's not going to get us with an eternal hell to me that's that's already wrote off that mystery has already been made known it's the mystery that's right here in this church and in here because let's read now 2nd Thessalonians does everybody okay to this remember we had a we had a white righteous church on the earth at the same time that Satan has brought his sayings started out as a little saying serene theist you know he says well Jesus was a like substance of god that was in Irina's this time that was in the Second Age so it wasn't far after Jesus's death did that that the people are already going well he wasn't God till till the River Jordan until God came down on him and well we understand that but but some people don't see that's another thing uess know what you're doing you're making you're making a second person when you do that and then so there's another mystery that to me is being made known through this message of the hour there's clarity we know that this is Adam is divided there's the true and the false but the real mystery is is where is that that's the real mystery is where it's at done all right there man now remember before we read this let me read you a few things around here remember it takes revelation to break the seal it takes a revelation God has to speak to you knock the brother Dale sure he's got to give it to the minister first but he's got to come to you amen all right what it's so what hello he's now closest thing is if it's not revealed to you it's the same because look God never revealed that saying that they said that there was an eternal hell God can't reveal that but somebody revealed it so much til they took it his doctrine father son Holy Ghost baptism it started as a saying God never told people to be baptized name father son holy go so it had to be Satan and his saying not the first church age that was a pure Church that had a revelation of one true and living God we're gonna see this seal is gonna wind up to that to see one true and living God amen all right to see that mystery of iniquity hey look if you can do this see what's happening now is we're working real close you know here's the devil and here's God but brother Brian said here goes a white horse rider riding away but he's taking what that mystery of iniquity is being made known so there's a separation one day Judas had to separate from Christ there had to be a separation something happened Jacob and Esau grew up in the same house came out of the same womb ate at the same table had the same righteous mother and father but one day what happened they had to separate right Cain and Abel Cain's problem was he went out from the presence of God so the Bible says in Genesis that was Cain's problem if he would have stayed there God could have helped him but he went out what he separated amen so when you see the separation you have the true and the false and that's what you and I need to see is the true and the false that all right so the revelation is what breaks to see them not any man except Christ all right so the voice of God which is the Thunder will read that in a couple of Sunday's from them it's going to not just tell me it's going to tell you not a private thing it is to you individually but what I'm saying is once it's given out once the profit stood that day and said here stands a land with the book of hand there goes wild horse rider see there God has already started doing the separating amen the man watch what brother brown Christ is revealed in his own word like brother Devon said read the titles of these sermons right souls in prison now my anointed ones at the end time man he knew that how to preach anointed ones because there had been a separation all right that okay say ma'am because remember we must know that this to me the seals is to show us what was what he is and what is to come it shows us the history of the church which is good it tells us what's going on right now and it's telling us what's going on even when we get out of here and man cuz this is all going to happen when we get out of here the man of sin is going to be sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God literally in a man but God's got it literally literally in case our become in me and you incarnate in us so then Satan says I see how to do it now he's waiting on us the very thing Satan thinks he's got God went for it's what US that's so vile iniquity sin Laden we can't get nothing right have a carnal mind we can't even think good thoughts every once in a while and Satan's going and that's God going to use that because he can't get a revelation of the true Word of God he sees what happens that he isn't you know like I said God's never had an aha moment you know when you go look let me go huh you know get cramps goes and cuts tough you know he goes uh-huh I didn't cut that right no see God don't have aha moment but Satan has him all the time Tango's aha that's how that happens why because he's not an originator he's a copycat man I don't want to follow a copycat do you but now remember our revelation must not be a saying it must be something that resides inside of you and I that's our problem brother branham said Samuel Dale said wait downstairs keep going Donny Regan's they said they said they said what what God say now if God and the man is one you better let you do it go that's the way God is gonna talk to you cuz listen I don't know about you but that's two things I have to deal with Garden the devil I'm stuck in there somewhere in between right I don't have to worry about like I said we don't worry about principalities and powers and what's coming up and all the moons that are doing this and global warming and one of the word about that step for you better be worried about you global warming ain't gonna be nothing when you're sitting in hell you gonna think global warming okay and nothing compared to if you go to the wrong place so let's go to heaven where the temperature is always gonna be the same and you know what it'll be it'll be to your liking Joyce it'll be hot but it'll be cool for me I have to walk up rejoicing shake your hand like this are you you don't have to wear sweater up three sweaters I promise you know and an overcoat thank you thank you then it's still freeze but you see what we're heading toward we're heading towards perfection and perfection is what perfection is what God God didn't put in there weighed their lights dick Addison light but you know what it's all in there whatever you desire that city is going to be built by what's in that Bible and it's gonna come from your desire ain't know what the property God said he said he's gonna build that city upon what you desire the desire of his bride so where's that gonna come from you it's gonna come from you so now let's read this and let's remember now as we go through this keep that word justification in your mind because we're getting there we're starting on Redemption right we start knowing on the mystery of iniquity but we're also going to be looking at Redemption and justification okay because remember those who has justified he's already glorified now that's not the justification when you become when you come up to the altar and say God forgive me of my sins well he does he's just to forgive you but you must go on to the sanctified condition then you must go on to the new birth of the baptism of the holy ghost then that justification will truly lead you to glorification amen but not just justification in its small self but now this justification that we're going to talk about when that mystery of iniquity is dirt away with that to me that's when I saw we see this cycle of death and we see this cycle of iniquity and how Satan beats us to death but I want you to see when we read this we're going to read the Bible today probably about ten scripture and I want you to see what God says to them before he went to Calvary before his blood was shed 2nd Thessalonians 2 verse 1 says now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him that should be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand now watch brother branham's tells us he says what Paul's doing is trying to tell the Thessalonians that God's not coming right at that moment he's not coming right then all right because watch what's got there's things gonna happen he says let no man now look it has come from a spirit the spirit which is a saying look you can't see a say right now when they make it a doctor and that's when they write it down on piece paper all right Aidid is something you do but when somebody just talks it's the same it's a spirit something you can't see but it's very powerful let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come what the day of Christ that day the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first now look in its in its infancy it happened in every Church age that's it in its infancy potentially it was heading toward something you ever heard that word potential okay a lot okay you gonna hear it some more because potentially that's what happened in every Church age there wasn't falling away and but they didn't know what that man's name was that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition because what they do they went some accepted that doctrine and they went on in the denomination some accepted the message of Paul irena smarten Colombian all the way down and what will they died in faith they died in the faith that Paul preached and then it became their faith and then when it started dwindling down a falling away came what God raised up Iranians to bring a message then a people took that message and not only listened to it became that message amen so we see the type down through the church ages but that man of sin I'll promise you he was sitting there he was right there in the church with them cuz every time they'd get a revelation Satan would say okay let's denominator that sounds real good don't it just don't it just you know icicles down you down your back makes you feel good let's denominator on that and some of the people says okay we'll make a Lutheran doctrine out of it we'll make a Wesleyan or a Methodist doctrine out of it but what did the property guard say now God moved on they stayed and God moved on well that was the separation that mystery of iniquity was still working that rider was still in there working as seemingly the right thing to do and at the time you know the Baptist were right for their time Methodists were right for their time but remember you can't take a Lutheran doctrine and sit here and that's just become Lutheran's I said the Lutheran doctrine that they stopped on the just shall live by faith let's go have a beer and smoke some well a few years we'll be smoking weed if it keeps going man California and all Colorado Lord of Mercy you talk about insanity now it's legal that you know what that's them though I mean they're gonna do what they're gonna do and you and I are going to be right here but that man of sin it's not in that smoking the weed drinking the beer he's in the church because where they got that doctrine was was in the church they got it from Martin Luther they got it from John Wesley they got it from the Pentecost and they got it from brother Branham if it's not true I said they got it not him listen brother Brown brought us a pure word of God what's all this junk doing out here it's that same horse rider it's that same rider except now it's not just one it's four of them it's all of them right if it's going to take all four horse riders I mean combat beasts to get us out of here guess where they're riding it up guess who's riding in opposition it's those four horse riders were talking about but he started off as a pure white church to get us what to get us close to get us involved to get us real close while it's okay you think what you want to like Bob was telling me this morning now that the Pentecostals and Episcopalians and the Catholics are all getting together unity and diversity let's say that again unity in diversity you see how insane that is but that's going to bring them all together I've got written in my nose down here to last but I'll tell you now listen God is a segregationist God is a segregation was he told Israel he said do not marry those Gentiles and I'll bless you they went round and married them hey man I got right down here to bottom all these doctrines God wanted us separated you don't want us to be a Baptist denomination now we have Baptist truth predestination and things like that we have us part of the truth that come from those churches and man listen brother Brown didn't come up with these words like theophany and lo Goss that was way before him look in your Scofield Bible Scofield was before my brother Branham came and he's talking about logos and the off and he and all these things now now but then you look at Scofield and he says the trinity is laced throughout the Bible we'll see you can take that and dump it out cuz that was a wild rider that was one riding through but there was truth in there that what you and I have got to see the separation and only the revealed Word of God is going to show the separation all right let no man deceive you by any means that for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed so in other words to you and I he's going to be totally so revealed to we're not going to be anywhere near him segregationist we're gonna segregate from that alright the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God he's made his way into the very temple of God showing himself not to be like God showing himself that He is God remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things that's been 2000 years ago when Paul said that and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time no words Paul said now you know why that the rapture is not gonna take place in my church age because this man's got to be what he's got to make his ride he's got to what there's got to be the word that goes forth and then there's got to be this guy this fellow that's gonna ride with him but there's going to be a separation somewhere and there'll be a great falling away and we see now like I said before in in small form there was a fall we never aged but look they were falling away a lot of times from part truth Hey where people are falling away now from the truth the purest truth that ever hits the face of the earth and people are saying oh he was wrong here he was wrong here he was it and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time now this is the time all right the true revelation of who we are is going to change our body that's this time for the mystery of iniquity now Nick what is what a hideous sin we know that it's it's has several meanings that's knowing to do good and not doing it or knowing not to do good and you do the bad part you got the good sitting right here and you said no I'm not gonna do that one to this see that's a hideous sin that's why Eve wasn't she wasn't part of that iniquity she didn't know no better Adam knew better he was the word for the day and he knew if he turned that down and went with her what would happen that he would sell the human race out because I read it right here a little while because of items iniquity for the mystery of iniquity doth already work so okay it's already beginning Paul said only he never only took a profit to tell us who that he was because it's not a capital H it's a little age but he said God it's only he who now letteth will wear what God's gonna let this thing go on until he he said the bride the church be taken out of the way so now it's gonna happen until we be taken out of the way then and then shall that wicked be revealed what the son of perdition the one that's going to stand in the temple of God and say I am God he's gonna go to Israel I am God I've come and he's going to take his little Gentile self and walk in that temple and him 144,000 are not gonna like that cuz they're gonna say hey wait a minute you're no we know who you are see how see how gods come up and he's brought a people to a place like you and I were already gone so he's brought us to what to the apex the heads come down on the body he's changed us took us out of here drop drop back down to Israel and here stand Satan again in the highest form he's ever been he's fixing to take over the world by religion and then that wicked shall be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders look he's not a defenseless guy all power and signs and lying wonders that's why it's going to be a battle between two prophets and the Pope or whatever you want to say the man of sin and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not now look they didn't receive they didn't receive not the truth they were seeing not the love of the truth that they might be saved so there's an out see I'm looking for an out I'm not looking for a I'm not looking for a back door but I'm looking for an out because I'm caught I'm caught in this you're caught in this we're looking for a way that God's already destroyed and we're gonna read it in just a little while it's always been in the Bible and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie now remember brother Browne said deal I the one Satan told Eve right all right so now let's read I want to read these we're gonna read scripture now because we're gonna take it from the Bible now look in the hebrew lexicon let's see what let's see what that word iniquity means now we know it comes from perversity depravity and but look at this right here see it word out there guilt guilt and guilt and guilt so iniquity is we were guilty and man we were guilty couldn't get out from under it we can't get out from under it cousin tells us we're guilty we're guilty we're guilty we're guilty but there is a way out I don't say at 53 verse 4 now we're gonna read all scriptures I got a few quotes maybe at the end but we may not read them let's read these and let's break them down a little bit because remember the mystery of iniquity is working in the people it's keeping us under something that we don't think we can get out of why we we put people in the ground this past year have we it's still working surely he has borne our griefs now this is I you know who this is this is Christ I wanted to bring this one first so this is the whole originator of everything how we got from under this yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity remember he had no iniquity no iniquity was found in him amen but there's plenty of us the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all so whatever iniquity we have we don't have it anymore if you'll believe that because where is it it's laid on him we don't believe what the Bible says the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all then all rights a man all right look at Titus Titus 2 verse 11 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem we have heard that word Redemption that he might redeem us from all iniquity so where's our inequity where we piling this onus for why we're doing it now guilty guilty guilty might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar in other words let me say I separated people zealous of good works who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity so we were caught we were caught in this mystery of iniquity amen but there's a way out not just from your soul all of you Micah 7 they shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth that shall be afraid of the Lord our God and shall fear because of thee who is a god like unto thee that pardon if iniquity we had it but he's fixing to annihilate it do away with it what does pardon pardon when you write to pardon remember once you accept it you're not guilty right you're not guilty they can't ever bring it back up even in a court of law the the natural court of the law you can't ever bring that back up you kill 10 more people and they'd never bring it back up if you've been pardoned so what about a god they can pardon that pardon if iniquity and pass this by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage now who's he talking about you and I he retained this not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy he will turn again he will have compassion horton so my preach on that the other day he say sympathy it's compassion upon us and he will subdue our iniquities and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea that's where you get the scripture he put my sins in the depths of the sea right there Psalms 51 now here's a man that knows about iniquity because Psalm 51 look at your footnote with Scofield to the chief musician a psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone into Bathsheba remember he goes in and commits adultery and he's getting ready to father a an unwed child and have his best friend kill right have mercy upon me O God according to thy loving-kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge there's the thing he repented I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have I sinned he didn't sin against Betsy but he didn't sin against your riah uh yeah I'll get you out your sin against then he said against God writes what he said against the the only have I sinned in other words I knew better and I did it anyway that's iniquity that thou mightest be what jequan me against then the only have I sinned and done this evil in my sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest he knows God's going to judge him be saying God behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirous truth in the inward man parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom he's telling God that he's going to redeem him Rock behold thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow how do you think Satan's getting his anointing watch you see how God is doing this but you see this guy over here he's riding right there with him purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities he's telling God I've repented and you being a just God you got to hide your face from my sins and blot out my iniquities I've done what I told you I was gonna do I repented I mean what else can we do listen folks if it's penance we're trying to do then let's just start beating each other out you know y'all beat me and I'll beat ya'll and we'll just beat each other to death we'll just have a bunch of dead people hellbound if we don't get right but you see what look honestly you see what the Catholic Church gets their doctrines is that if we can do something to appease God instead of just what Martin Luther comes out and he says the just shall live by faith not by those peanuts not by crawling on the on the ground because look David tried that to remember before before the baby died he laid out on the stones he drug yourself on the stones way cried all night hide thy face from my sins and bought out mine iniquity I hope this is helping you because look this is already in here that this is done don't put David in there I'm the same way I'm a murderer a liar thief and whoremonger I was I have that in my past but if God put it in a civics forgetfulness he's gonna go what sins they were to write a song about that what sins are you talking about right Aaron you write a few verses in that tape all right let's go to the next one Psalm 32:1 through to psalm of David my skill blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man to whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile goodness gracious psalm 32:5 i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid so you can't hide this man's hiding we're just to be an open book but there's a way out I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin what's our problem he's talking to a bank slim prophet in the Old Testament remember what brother Brown says that Jesus raised on the on the prophecy of a backslidden prophet David said they'll not leave my soul in hey Lord leave I'm just telling you what the brother Graham said but X is the backslidden whoremonger and king that he what he is telling us what God's already said what God's already done that's why I believe that David is the apple of God's eye David was a human man but God knew if he could ever get in David soul he would be probably the most perfect person to ever live because of the way his attitude was toward God member brother Brent said our attitude alright so some thirty to five now let's go to Psalms 119 132 to 133 look down upon me and be merciful unto me as thou uses to do unto those that love thy name order my steps in that word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me none alright you think well I want you to tell me about the first seal we're talking about redemption what is this it's how God is look I'm gonna read you in a minute how God's gonna redeem Israel he promised them look they're sitting over there today the the Orthodox Jew saying God loves us God said he would bring us by God said we'd have this land God said don't send up there not knowing that God's already turned away from them but why can't you and I take the revelation that God has went and give us the same thing surely what goes to Israel's got to come to us they get land we get gone proverbs 16:6 now how is iniquity purged now look that word purged that's what's happening in the seals God is purging us now when we were doing foreclosed home there would be water in the lines and they would want that water purged it was there we knew it was there but they didn't want it to free so we would what put pressure we'd take a we'd take a air compressor hook it up to the lines and we would purge our bloat we knew it was in there thereby getting this illustration we knew the water was in there but it had there was a way I hope you see this this is there's got to be a way to get out there's a way for that water to get all the way out turn some pressure and let it blow that line until all you see is air all you hear is air you don't see any water coming out my mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil that all right say ma'am Isaiah 6 verse 5 what's going to purchase mercy and truth not mercy and error or not condemnation and error mercy and truth I was there 6 verse 5 then I said woe is me for I am undone this is me because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts now who is this that says Isaiah in the temple all right then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched my lips and dine iniquity it's taken away and I since first I'm just reading you what the Lord said the coal fire put on the lips of Isaiah this have touched our lips and on iniquity is taken away and our sin purged Daniel 9:24 very familiar what's what he's going to do do you ever realize this seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things now we're going to take this maybe at the very end another year from now if the rapture don't they please we're going to take these six things and we're going to put them in the six seals because remember six seals finishes Redemption not seven six six seals finishes Redemption so six the six fold purpose finishes the redemption of Israel that all right say ma'am all right seventy weeks are determined upon thy people upon my holy city to do one finish the transgression what finish it you can't burn somebody that's that's dirty make an end of sins end and to make reconciliation for iniquity remember what he said he said the people said let his blood be on us and our children and for petrol perpetual generations that's what's happened but there's going to be a reconciling time there's going to be a time he's gonna reconcile their iniquity not remember it no more bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy prophesying anoint the most holy let's go to Jeremiah 31 now watch remember remember who Jeremiah was Jeremiah was a prophet that was during the time that Israel was coming back home restoring everything getting everything coming back up watch but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man is neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord watch for they shall all know me in other words they're going to be an out spreading of the Holy Ghost there's going to be an out spreading of God that they're not gonna have to go to the temple to get that's what he's saying right here alright so put us in here now this is to us for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more that God's a liar if he can't got the law he can't do that but I don't think is because if he wrote it in the Bible he's able to do it and he's already done it I believe we just got to realize it Jeremiah 33 verse 7 and I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return and we'll build them as at the first no restoration Redemption he's bringing a bite and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they sin against me and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me pretty clean people he's took their sin away he's took their iniquity away and that's Israel what about us spiritual Israel all right let's go to Jeremiah 50 and in those days and in that time saith the Lord the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none in other words Satan's gonna say don't you remember you told them not he said I don't let us in there I say no you say it that way you didn't hear me right I said look I said the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah and they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserved Ezra 9 and after the watch now remember as remember he was the blushing prophet and watch him talk about Israel and I highlighted this cuz I want you to put this is exactly in the age that we're living in all right cuz it's at the evening sacrifice now why would it be at the evening sacrifice if it wasn't any in time the evening time and that the evening sacrifice I rose up from my heaviness and have rent my Garmin and my mantle and I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands into the Lord my god an ice and said oh my god I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god now there's a prophet that seeing the iniquity of Israel turning against God putting up idols left the homeland tore everything down and Ezra and Nehemiah ng them are trying to hurt him back into the Promised Land right all right just think about that you see sometimes you have to put yourself in Ezra's place he was blessing good I don't know I can't even I can't even talk to you anymore because but watch what God said and said oh my god I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespasses grown up unto the heavens looks like a total impossibility that we're ever going to get back since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day now I say from the beginning of the church ages because really in the church ages remember there was no doctrinal issues until the church age has started because remember Satan inject itself into the church age right because there was no look because look come back to here there was no doctrine in these first three Church ages the doctrine started developing in these ages since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass until this day and for our iniquities have we our Kings our preachers our preachers been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands money whipping women popularity to the sword to captive into a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day same thing right here Ezra could sit in free could be here five minutes and he'd go I said that about 5,000 years ago you're sitting in the same place but watch and now for a little space Grace has been showed from the Lord our God about how to kick and fit when I sitting there reading this one this was one of the last ones and I thought man this is you and I to leave us a remnant to escape to give us a nail in this holy place that our God may what give us revelation lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage man let's read some 103 I guess it didn't excite you like it didn't me but to me I see the redemption to now through all every scripture you read you see Redemption that's all you want to see his Redemption how God's going to redeem Israel redeem us redeem the world everything's got to be redeemed because we were caught in this mystery of iniquity with no way out because the member ffetzer if it's a mystery it's been hit if it's been hidden you can't figure out how to get out of it but since these sails have opened what brother Brown say the Bible became a brand new book now I'm not telling you brother Brant read these same scriptures and thought the same way I did but I'll guarantee you he saw redemption in every scripture that he read a psalm of David blessed the Lord O my soul and all that is within me he ought to write a song about them bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction think about this who crown a--they with loving-kindness he's not talking about this crown right here he's talking about who crown us them with loving-kindness and tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagle body body change last thing who satisfies thy mouth with good things out of thy mouth with for what rivers of living water so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagle this is redemption redemption redemption there is no way we could have got out had they not we have not been able to see the separation of that wild horse rider riding off now remember he keeps riding on that old God gets off of one and he jumps on another one and we're going to get in there in a little while but next Sunday we want to talk about justification because you ought to see now there was a group of people justified in the Bible amen and I'm included in that group sure Israel my even Eve's going to be restored even eating is going to be restored how they'll be restored iniquity is going to be destroyed and housing will be destroyed by revelation of something previously hid and now being made known let's stand our feet Amen something previously hid that's been right here in this Bible that we keep reading and reading and we swear that they put another chapter in something because we never read that before all these things if he's if he did that to a backslidden Israel what about you and I folks listens where what that Old Testament talked about where watch that blessing prophet he wasn't talking to Israel he was talking to me and you thank your brother he went dogging Israel surely was a prophet to Israel but in the evening sacrifice in the latter part of the day that's us the day of the Lord were at the end time were at the evening sacrifice Elijah at the evening sacrifice all those that they evening sacrifice this is the evening time later than you think amen but that mystery of iniquity how to destroy it is written right here but it took a prophet to open our eyes so that we could see you see because look he never read any of them scripture he broke the seal a prophet has to get it straight from God listen there's nobody can correct William Branham it's God and brother Branham and all of us minions down here below and I'm telling you we we ain't got to this spot in the word yet you got it but there was nobody between God and brother Branham nobody he got it straight from God and he give it to us and look at the mess we're in the mystery of iniquity still works until he what he be taken out of the way till you and I are takin out of the way listen we're stopping Israel's Redemption there's look honestly there's no progression over there of the word now there's the old timers there's the Orthodox Jew that keep reading the Torah and keep reading the Torah and keep reading remember they don't have Matthew Mark Luke and John and I they don't late that didn't happen sure they study it for commentaries but that didn't happen they're looking to Ezra they're looking to Jeremiah's promises that I will Joel I will restore they're saying oh that's us but remember God already left that now it's us you and I or the bride of Jesus Christ they had their time they had their time they had their opportunity but remember they didn't know how to get out and you and I know how to get out you and I know how to get out of this mess because of what God's already brought us let's sing a song if you have a need I'll fly away I'll fly away [Music] morning [Music] [Applause] ghazal ashore Oh [Music] you're fine Taylor this our Kanda by [Music] don't fly away [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we never made any further so he kept going the same way every time [Music] our sang weary days and day [Music] [Applause] to [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] why [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] why [Applause] [Music] they ran from [Music] it just takes believing believe it's for you believe God sent Elijah to you he sent you Elijah to tell you these things now remember he's the porter that stands and opens the door he was the Eleazar that that that got Rebecca and Isaac together but remember he ain't going to tent three's a crowd amen but he told Rebecca so much about Isaac till she didn't have an Instagram photo of him but when she got close enough she saw a characteristic like she had been told Eliezer preached for 1,100 sermons to tell them what their eyes is going to be when they see him and when she got up she lighted off the camel she didn't just get off and go now she knew who he was by the LEDs are they told her about everything about his characteristic and she absolutely knew who he was but you know what's wonderful brother Branham was a little bit different in that because he was he le s AR but he was also Rebecca cuz he was part of the bride he was also he was the one that introduced and he's the one that even was introduced to talk to but he was part of the bride so he did get to go into ten but not as Ellie's are he went in his wife the bride of Jesus Christ a man [Music] why did God reveal their stars Wow because he knew we'd accept didn't do something with it he knew
