[0:02] right now
[0:16] good morning everybody
[0:21] out there
[0:27] you bombed upstairs today
[0:32] around just a little bit and let's let's
[0:37] just stand
[0:55] do a wonderful job of speaking under the
[0:58] people we pray that you would just rest
[0:59] each one and just have your way Lord I
[1:03] absolutely love you and we thank you in
[1:06] Jesus name amen
[1:10] we've just changed things around a
[1:12] little bit we ain't been gone and
[1:23] that's the way we do it but you know we
[1:26] started a few minutes early maybe we'd
[1:27] quit a few minutes early so I'm going to
[1:28] holler at me if I clock this morning I
[1:31] thought I might get started or not I
[1:33] know that Wade has been speaking to you
[1:35] for quite a while on the Statue of a
[1:37] perfect man
[1:38] and I don't know exactly what to live
[1:41] he's in on but what I want to do is go
[1:43] back
[1:45] and just take a basics
[1:47] and just speak on that from you know the
[1:50] scriptures that y'all been reading on
[1:52] and doing so if you want to turn in your
[1:54] scripture turn the second Peter
[1:57] one and we'll just read the scriptures
[2:00] and then we'll we'll go on into because
[2:03] all I want to read is like the first
[2:04] four or five verses because I don't want
[2:06] to get into the to the uh text to the
[2:09] doing this wage and they're doing them
[2:12] speaking on this background perfect man
[2:14] but to just speak on a kind of a a
[2:17] little something like light precious
[2:19] faith
[2:20] accomplish what we want we want
[2:23] study on for a minute the Sunday school
[2:25] I mean good to see everybody down here I
[2:28] didn't realize there was this many
[2:30] coming here they said we needed a bigger
[2:32] place so we might have to do it someday
[2:35] just walk around some of these rooms but
[2:36] now let's just read your scripture Peter
[2:38] and the Apostle of Jesus Christ to The
[2:41] Strangers scattered throughout on his
[2:43] relationship Cappadocia Asia
[2:46] and Bethany elect according what number
[2:48] four knowledge of God the Father through
[2:50] sanctification of the spirit until
[2:52] obedience and strengthening of the blood
[2:54] of Jesus Christ
[2:57] I'm reading
[2:59] theater
[3:09] okay
[3:11] I couldn't wait to say I'm old I'm sick
[3:14] yeah
[3:16] 7123 all right let's go to where we're
[3:19] supposed to be excuse us out there
[3:25] Simon Peter are servant and Apostle of
[3:27] Jesus Christ are them that have a time
[3:28] like Precious faith for those through
[3:31] the righteousness of God and our Savior
[3:33] Jesus Christ Grace be grace and peace be
[3:36] modified unto you through the knowledge
[3:38] of God and of Jesus our lord according
[3:41] as his divine power has given unto us
[3:43] all things that pertain to life and God
[3:46] understood the knowledge of him that
[3:49] have called us to Glory merger for by
[3:51] our given unto us
[3:53] now what exceeding great and precious
[3:56] promises
[3:57] that by these the prophet emphasizing
[4:00] these promises
[4:02] all right
[4:03] that you might be partakers of the
[4:04] divine nature have an escape the
[4:06] corruption that is in the world through
[4:09] lust then you go into the virtues but
[4:12] what I wanted to say is talk a minute
[4:14] about
[4:16] you know like Precious faith
[4:18] because it says there that
[4:20] if you promised
[4:22] but who is it promised to
[4:26] now if we read the scripture there and
[4:28] it says promise all right then what
[4:31] we're reading is a promise
[4:33] okay so if it's a promise then we can
[4:37] depend on
[4:39] you know receiving and we don't have to
[4:42] worry about it all right but who's it
[4:43] too
[4:45] continuing great and precious promise
[4:48] right now that's the point I want you to
[4:51] think about
[4:53] the prophet said on
[4:56] paragraph 33 of the Statue of perfect
[4:58] man this is not to the world
[5:02] now I've always told you you know from
[5:05] the ministering to you the Bible is not
[5:07] written to the world
[5:09] you eat Us in the basis for them to read
[5:12] and see Christ
[5:14] all right but the Bible is really
[5:16] written to those that are in Christ
[5:18] Jesus okay now you understand my points
[5:22] see then it's to someone to bring them
[5:24] to Christ
[5:25] but that's like a letter that I would
[5:28] write
[5:30] to my wife and I would be over sneezing
[5:33] when I'd write a letter to her all right
[5:35] now the letter is to her
[5:39] and her only but I may say you know uh
[5:42] is the kids doing all right until the
[5:43] kids Hello are they doing this are they
[5:45] doing that or you know and all because
[5:47] that can be a part to them to somebody
[5:50] else so for a sinner to read the Bible
[5:54] he can read the Bible and see that he
[5:56] needs to be saved but really the Bible
[5:58] that he reads is you
[6:01] right that's the one that brings him to
[6:04] this knowledge that we need to have all
[6:07] right now Peter said he was speaking to
[6:10] those of light precious faith
[6:14] all right now
[6:18] the light precious faith
[6:21] in other words it's just one Faith one
[6:23] Lord one bad future right there's not
[6:27] many things there's not many things
[6:29] there's many there's levels but not many
[6:31] different faiths there's only one Faith
[6:33] one Lord one bad kid all right so then
[6:36] Peter was telling these people
[6:39] the space
[6:42] that's what he starts off telling you
[6:43] all right and he said then I'm speaking
[6:46] to you that has this Faith all right now
[6:49] he's not telling them of the Statue of
[6:52] perfect man the growth development in
[6:55] his first readings he's only telling off
[6:58] this faith
[7:00] this new birth because you can't answer
[7:03] it says add to your faith well how did
[7:05] you get that faith
[7:07] it says add to your faith virtual mother
[7:10] how did you get the value you can only
[7:12] get it by being born again
[7:14] ain't no man can call Jesus a Christ
[7:16] except what except it be by the Holy
[7:18] Ghost
[7:19] all right it's got to be an inside
[7:21] teacher
[7:22] there's no way you can can say well uh
[7:26] you know this is to everybody it's not
[7:28] now listen to what I'm saying
[7:30] then
[7:32] this statue of a perfect man was to be
[7:35] basically in the end time
[7:37] because the way was lost through the
[7:40] ages of this that we needed these favor
[7:43] International you know and it was only
[7:46] coming forth with just a new birth but
[7:48] now we're commanded to go forth into the
[7:50] statue of perfect man he'll bring about
[7:52] a Rapture all right now but back up see
[7:55] if we don't have the life pressure faith
[7:58] Peter said I've got that thing
[8:02] reading your scripture there and he said
[8:04] I'm talking to you that have that Faith
[8:07] you that have the new birth I have the
[8:10] new birth he said
[8:12] and you need the new birth before you
[8:14] can even get started there's no promises
[8:17] to you without anybody right right
[8:19] you're not promised anything but the the
[8:22] world and condemnation and death and
[8:24] Sorrows if you're reading the Bible
[8:27] see that's what I'm trying to say to us
[8:29] upstairs about the law
[8:31] this Bible becomes just a law right
[8:34] because it can only condemn you right
[8:36] until you're born again you cannot have
[8:39] anything to set you free so you can't be
[8:42] the Bible's not written to you
[8:44] and does everybody understand that it's
[8:46] written that a sinner can read it
[8:49] and become saved but it's not written to
[8:53] him it's written to those that are in
[8:56] Christ go over to Ephesians the Saints
[8:59] and emphasis
[9:00] the Romans abilities for those that are
[9:02] in Christ Jesus I think it's not written
[9:05] to the world
[9:07] it's written to you and I that are born
[9:09] again
[9:10] why do you understand that then we must
[9:12] have the new birth the prophet said
[9:13] that's the most important thing in the
[9:15] world it's whether or not you're born
[9:16] again well I need these virtues
[9:20] well you can't get the virtues until
[9:21] you're born again right I mean Josiah
[9:24] now Jonas he can't uh he can't grow as a
[9:29] baby or didn't until he got here now we
[9:31] know he did in the womb coming up to the
[9:33] state but he wasn't wasn't alive he
[9:35] wasn't doing it but then there was a day
[9:36] that he'd become alive
[9:38] then he can start growing in his nature
[9:43] and already now
[9:45] you know he's beginning to develop his
[9:48] own nature
[9:50] he's one of uh Rising her children each
[9:53] one has a little different nature
[9:54] identical twins
[9:57] one will have one form of a nature it
[9:59] will have another you remember the one
[10:01] that sister Cooley had years ago the
[10:03] picture of the the two girls that just
[10:05] had one body from here down
[10:07] we get up here there was two heads and
[10:10] and they had their own individual
[10:11] thinking well I'm like boy the other one
[10:13] did
[10:14] right it was so odd to me that they
[10:16] could be that much connected until they
[10:19] didn't have to stay you're on that side
[10:21] move that hand you're on that side but
[10:24] if it didn't have to do it their brain
[10:25] was so connected with everything until
[10:28] it just moved and wonderful but yet they
[10:31] still had a different nature and that's
[10:34] what about it through the statue of a
[10:36] perfect man
[10:37] see but before now my point is is number
[10:40] four before you ever start the growth
[10:43] development
[10:44] you must have the new birth
[10:48] it's not a question of whether or not as
[10:51] Richard said when he read it he'd never
[10:52] seen that when he came down you know
[10:54] with us years ago he'd never seen that
[10:57] that
[10:59] it was a necessity
[11:01] you had to have it you've got to have
[11:04] these virtues in this day
[11:08] you know because this is the value of
[11:10] the time whatever age had a new birth
[11:14] so every age Peter could have spoke to
[11:17] the church in the days of Martin Luther
[11:19] it just had to adjust your live by faith
[11:21] attend anywhere he could have spoke to
[11:23] them and said you know it's like
[11:27] Precious Faith that's what I want you to
[11:29] see the light precious faith is the new
[11:32] birth
[11:34] don't worry about the the gross the
[11:37] thing we'll get to it in a minute when
[11:39] the prophet tells you how to do that how
[11:41] do you how did the baby grow you stopped
[11:43] feeding Jonas and what happened
[11:46] he won't grow but you keep feeding him
[11:48] that's all you got to do you just got to
[11:51] feed him Lord the prophet said you keep
[11:53] drinking in
[11:55] you keep pushing out he said now you
[11:58] don't take apples and pour them at the
[12:00] root of the tree
[12:03] yeah this is his work you don't take
[12:05] apples or oranges or something pour them
[12:07] at the root of the tree and then they
[12:08] grow
[12:09] this is it's in there we said you've got
[12:13] to keep putting the water on it which is
[12:15] your washing for the Water by the word
[12:17] all right so then it's a necessity that
[12:20] we have the life precious faith
[12:23] we must have a new birth before we can
[12:26] get started you said well I don't know
[12:28] whether I had enough well then that's
[12:29] what you need to work on you don't need
[12:30] to work on all this other over here
[12:32] that's fine
[12:34] but you need to work on whether or not
[12:36] you're born again
[12:38] because that's the point that you got to
[12:40] start from you can't even start the
[12:42] growth development
[12:44] Jonas couldn't start developing as a
[12:46] child until it was born
[12:48] so is it with us we have to have then
[12:52] the light pressures faith
[12:54] and that's the first four verses she is
[12:57] dealing with that and if you have the
[12:59] light precious value
[13:02] he said then these promises
[13:05] all right
[13:07] promised unto you if you have the new
[13:09] birth if you don't have a new birth
[13:10] there's no promise me right but you get
[13:13] the new bird then when you receive the
[13:15] new birth and you say okay I'm in line
[13:19] I'm in the family
[13:21] I'm I'm in that part now I could grow
[13:23] and do this and I can the Lord can use
[13:27] me to to do things and and will speak
[13:29] and do through the statue of a perfect
[13:31] man but you first got to have that light
[13:34] precious faith
[13:36] and see that's why the Bible is not
[13:38] written into a sinner
[13:40] it's written to those that are in Christ
[13:43] Jesus
[13:44] the church should help says the church
[13:46] is to murder the church at Philadelphia
[13:48] you know all of the seven churches the
[13:51] lady will see you
[13:53] it's written to the bride of Christ now
[13:56] in the church we do know that it spoke
[13:58] out some of the fault time too but yet
[14:00] we're dealing with coming into Christ
[14:02] all right now the prophet said it like
[14:05] this he said after coming into the body
[14:08] that's positioned in Christ he said
[14:09] after you come in the body then these
[14:11] are the things we expect you to have
[14:15] it expects you to grow but the main
[14:17] thing is the life precious faith
[14:21] and if we don't have that
[14:24] it's not speaking to us well brother now
[14:26] I've been in the message 40 years we're
[14:28] wonderful
[14:29] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[14:31] since you believe
[14:32] bro do you have the Holy Spirit that's
[14:36] the thing it's not whether or not when
[14:39] we need to go somewhere where that they
[14:41] teach this that or the other we need to
[14:43] go to another church where they can and
[14:46] tell us these things I'm I've never said
[14:49] anything about anybody that goes anymore
[14:50] jail never said anybody was off the word
[14:52] for living here
[14:54] but I do say one thing
[14:58] if you live here trying to go there
[15:01] to find something to help you
[15:04] it's not going to do you any good to get
[15:06] born again
[15:07] no matter where you're at what you're
[15:09] doing it's not going to do any good
[15:11] until you're born again
[15:13] all right so get born again then if you
[15:15] want to go somewhere downstairs that way
[15:17] then there's no problem because that way
[15:19] you can go by the growth development
[15:21] but now you know but even pray here if
[15:25] you are set on the basis that we do
[15:28] handle the word hard
[15:30] we do require that much well if you can
[15:33] find more than what we do here let me
[15:35] know because I won't taste from dark and
[15:37] if we can we'll have to go there to get
[15:39] it because I want it too but I want
[15:42] these virtues
[15:44] all right and I know we brought him a
[15:47] priests did there in 71 I ask him I said
[15:50] you worked in this state as many times I
[15:52] said brother Lord that's wonderful but
[15:54] now how do I get to virtue
[15:56] because he spent lengthy time that rough
[15:58] takes if you want to listen to him he
[16:00] spent lengthy time explaining the
[16:02] precious promises
[16:05] and the different things just what I'm
[16:07] saying right now you know first we're
[16:08] born again that gives you light pressure
[16:10] today not written to the world written
[16:12] into the bride of Christ and I believe
[16:14] then we get the promises of these things
[16:18] we can we can do we can have the
[16:20] promises then well because we're alive
[16:22] and then he started from fighting first
[16:24] or not and I asked him I said how do I
[16:26] get them
[16:28] because you look at it you see where it
[16:30] says patience well you say well
[16:32] tribulation working patient so we'll
[16:34] just take a will we'll start working
[16:35] each other you know and all of this that
[16:37] the other that wouldn't work too good
[16:39] would it I don't think that would even
[16:41] bring it
[16:43] and I put us all in jail but
[16:46] see it's not that to bring in and
[16:49] knowledge is not intellectual
[16:52] understanding I know the way it's been
[16:54] through these things it's Holy Ghost
[16:56] knowledge well if you ain't got the Holy
[16:59] Ghost how can you have Holy Ghost
[17:00] knowledge
[17:02] you got your own thinking until you're
[17:04] born again
[17:06] your own knowledge your only way of
[17:09] going you know until you're born again
[17:11] all right so we need the life precious
[17:13] faith
[17:15] and once we get that life precious faith
[17:19] see then we can start growing
[17:21] all right
[17:22] so then the main thing today is what
[17:24] make sure you got it
[17:26] well brother Dale I've been in the
[17:28] message 40 years I'd hate to go tell
[17:30] somebody that I wasn't born again but I
[17:32] do he'd rather do that than the mission
[17:38] I've always told you that I'd rather be
[17:40] seeking God all my life you know he can
[17:42] do it and find out I got it then do not
[17:45] seek him and get down there and find out
[17:46] I didn't have it he said well can we do
[17:48] that that's what he said about the lady
[17:50] that's on Sunday school you know all the
[17:52] things the rather explain that about a
[17:54] lady so he got down the end of the road
[17:56] and she cried out for the preachers and
[17:58] you lied to me
[18:00] that's one thing you can't hear say that
[18:03] we haven't taught you the new birth
[18:06] now some of you have been to other
[18:07] churches and come from other places and
[18:09] been there how much did they talk about
[18:11] the new murder
[18:14] no it was a great revelation of the
[18:16] density of great things and Glory
[18:18] Hallelujah and we're this and we're that
[18:19] the other and then they get into all
[18:21] these doctrines and idea and when they
[18:23] do what does it give you
[18:26] maybe can't get one time on that
[18:28] expression watch your passion completely
[18:29] won't show she said I don't know if I've
[18:31] been there good for a year never heard
[18:32] anybody count
[18:34] well
[18:35] you know I think after a couple years
[18:37] Lord at least get around talking about
[18:39] Who We Are
[18:40] in Salvation because it's in the soul
[18:42] not in the body
[18:44] but he understand it won't say
[18:48] get the new bird
[18:50] then
[18:52] you can worry about it
[18:55] and it's like I've told you then the
[18:58] Lord showed me finally in 19 about 1980
[19:03] you said if you receive the word
[19:06] reveal or not letter that you read
[19:10] as you receive the reveal word it will
[19:13] bring these virtues
[19:15] all right now
[19:18] I'm a firm believer in growth
[19:20] development
[19:22] and a lot of people think you can just
[19:24] jump up here and get this and jump over
[19:26] here and get that now I'm seriously
[19:30] I don't believe in Jungle
[19:33] I believe in growth development that
[19:35] would be like saying Jonas there you
[19:38] know beginning to take a step or two
[19:41] next week you won't be running in the
[19:43] marathon
[19:44] no I'm not quiet now not exactly
[19:49] do you think well I can jump up here and
[19:51] get this
[19:52] I think I need I think I need knowledge
[19:55] so I just jump up here and get knowledge
[19:59] oh why not get started goodbye
[20:05] they can use a little like Precious
[20:07] faith
[20:09] and then what's made from
[20:11] a virtue
[20:15] no I want knowledge we'll see what
[20:17] you're doing
[20:19] you're bypassing the channel of the way
[20:22] God brings you now sure
[20:25] we even receive as you see The Headstone
[20:27] on the pyramid
[20:28] we received from that as a pool to us
[20:32] that's what we're magnetized to if you
[20:35] have that new birth at the bottom right
[20:38] and you're pulling from that that
[20:40] headstone is pulling you but don't say I
[20:42] got The Headstone but now I need virtue
[20:46] now you're going backwards
[20:49] just like I said if you say well I don't
[20:52] need to do birds I just need to I need
[20:54] somebody to teach me to mention
[20:58] pretty deeply confidence
[21:01] you can be taught a lot of hidden
[21:03] knowledge that's not the knowledge in
[21:05] the statute perfectly
[21:08] and see reading is wonderful we do that
[21:10] we we do at least today
[21:13] but you could be listening to uh the
[21:16] seal
[21:18] you're going to be listening to a series
[21:20] in the sealed or something and just
[21:21] listening to the tapes of running around
[21:23] and God may give you virtue
[21:28] you say well that virtuous stream well
[21:31] strength
[21:32] is is one
[21:34] what is strength in this natural perfect
[21:36] thing
[21:38] it's the word of God that has given you
[21:40] strength the revealed word of God each
[21:43] one of those virtues is more and more of
[21:46] the reveal word
[21:49] yeah but I'm up here in front of the
[21:51] kindness well how did you get up there
[21:55] how did you jump and run into college I
[21:57] mean did you run and jump a ladder and
[21:59] it went way up no no you can't get up to
[22:02] brotherly kindness until you come from
[22:05] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[22:08] God's Mission
[22:10] now that doesn't mean that you don't
[22:12] have a brother to become
[22:14] that means you don't have a godliness
[22:16] about you that doesn't mean that you
[22:19] don't have patience
[22:21] but it means in the statute of Earth man
[22:26] that's not talking about this natural
[22:27] brother I'm sitting there what
[22:30] he said you can have a portion of these
[22:31] virtues are not even be born again there
[22:34] are good people in the world that has a
[22:37] lot of those virtues right not even
[22:40] Christians right but that don't change
[22:43] it
[22:44] can you please please
[22:52] how to get the newborn
[22:59] there in this day
[23:02] that we're living in we're not back in
[23:04] the other ages okay highest quick run
[23:06] through in the days of Luther it was
[23:09] just to believe
[23:11] now that gave them the new birth
[23:14] like I said Luther probably preached
[23:16] many times on you know about
[23:19] justification
[23:21] probably preached sermon done lectures
[23:23] on justification of what it meant
[23:26] but one day God quickened it under me
[23:29] and said and just shall live outside
[23:31] that was his new birth
[23:33] All Right Wesley come in with
[23:35] sanctification you got a lot of other
[23:37] doing but then it was sanctification
[23:40] be in the days of Wesley and West we
[23:43] believe what Luther taught and the judge
[23:46] shall live a fight
[23:47] but then he's saying that you must be
[23:50] sanctified
[23:52] that doesn't mean Luther wasn't
[23:54] sanctified
[23:57] Luther goddess sanctification he got the
[24:00] new birth he got to cleanse him out
[24:02] watch in a second if we go up come back
[24:04] down all right Pentecostals come along
[24:06] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[24:08] right requiring the three stages or
[24:12] three works it's really not words but
[24:14] coming up to the New Birth all right
[24:17] now then you must receive in this day
[24:20] justification by Believing on the Lord
[24:22] Jesus Christ
[24:23] that I believe is a definite work
[24:27] you don't just come in the message and
[24:29] say you know we preach the sermon today
[24:31] brother Bob gets through somebody walks
[24:33] down to the Altar and they say I want
[24:35] the Holy Ghost
[24:36] well they've never heard anything
[24:40] well I'm not saying God can't do it
[24:42] because he can do what he wants to but
[24:44] I'm saying that most of the time you
[24:46] ain't gonna do it that way
[24:47] that's why brother Branham you notice
[24:49] he'll say you people hear you come to
[24:51] the office he said now get with these
[24:54] other brothers and bank and get them to
[24:56] pray for you to receive the bad kids
[24:58] from the Holy Ghost all right see then
[25:01] that's what it is you believe on the
[25:02] Lord Jesus Christ you repent
[25:05] and say father forgive me
[25:07] and I believe all that this Prophet is
[25:09] taught I believe the word
[25:11] you know all right that'll cleanse that
[25:14] old thing out of you read page 14 15 16
[25:18] of the future home that's the best one
[25:20] to go to all right now let me get that
[25:23] part before and then we'll come back all
[25:24] right then see you get sanctification
[25:28] I believe in a definite work of
[25:30] justification I definitely work with
[25:32] sanctification a definite work with a
[25:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost and what a lot
[25:36] of people does they say I get it all
[25:37] here
[25:39] okay praise God if that's what you got
[25:42] but if that's not what you got then you
[25:44] just you ruin that stuff you go from
[25:47] justification sanctification
[25:49] and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:51] which is the person of Jesus Christ
[25:53] coming in you
[25:55] it didn't come in you when you repented
[25:57] of your sin you're only going to work in
[25:59] your life sanctification is very close
[26:02] because that Spirit does come in enough
[26:04] to cleanse out
[26:06] like the glass you pick it up that just
[26:09] for the day all right sanctification you
[26:11] wash the glass you scald it you do
[26:13] everything to clean it it looks good
[26:16] but then you need to receive the baptism
[26:18] in order to go well you say well then
[26:22] what how do I know I've got it
[26:25] it's whether or not the spirit of you
[26:27] agrees with the word now agrees means
[26:30] keep on
[26:31] it's not just you say I believe
[26:35] I believe it either believe it and he's
[26:37] baptize you'll be so all right see then
[26:39] you go through the stages you receive
[26:41] the new birth that gives you the light
[26:43] precious faith
[26:46] that Peter's picking up Peter had went
[26:48] through those things in his life
[26:50] he had been justified by Believing on
[26:52] the Lord Jesus Christ right followed him
[26:55] he was Sanctified in Saint John 17.
[26:58] right
[27:00] when Jesus explaining the unclean Spirit
[27:02] goeth out of a man walking to the drive
[27:03] all right but he didn't have the new
[27:05] birth
[27:06] until he got to the death penthouse
[27:10] and see then I believe in a definite
[27:12] time to be justified
[27:13] Jump Off You By sin Sanctified please
[27:16] and set aside and then
[27:19] the new Bible I want it all at once by
[27:23] the word by the word right I want it all
[27:25] at once that's the way we are right
[27:28] but that's not God's way of doing it now
[27:31] I need to do that if you want to but
[27:32] it's according to the nature of the
[27:34] person to do it you got to remember one
[27:37] thing you know Sister truly if you're
[27:38] real quick you got to remember one thing
[27:40] those are possible for three and a half
[27:43] years
[27:44] never had anywhere
[27:49] because Jesus Christ did not die
[27:51] see this took them three and a half
[27:54] years to be justified and sanctified
[28:00] right
[28:01] and it was done gradually by the washing
[28:03] of the water of the word that Jesus was
[28:05] bringing in in coming out and then on
[28:08] that Pentecost
[28:10] and see Jesus we're saying of over 500
[28:12] brethren
[28:14] but there was only 120 maybe Upper Room
[28:17] those 380 didn't get to hold you
[28:21] a while ago I ain't seen it didn't later
[28:23] yet but didn't get it back unless the
[28:26] other one
[28:28] going into the layer could have been
[28:30] that's right
[28:32] go ahead
[28:39] or do you have to have the Holy Ghost
[28:43] a revelation
[28:46] okay yeah a revelation
[28:49] my Center can receive a revelation but
[28:51] it's a time frame
[28:53] Etc it is not eternal life
[28:57] it is like for healing
[29:00] cleansing
[29:02] you know it's a revelation oh Abel had a
[29:05] revelation
[29:07] Saints could get a revelation but it
[29:10] would not give them the new birth
[29:12] all right
[29:14] that Revelation then was I called it a
[29:17] time frame or a situation
[29:20] right and see then we can get a
[29:23] revelation
[29:24] I believe justification is a definite
[29:27] revelation of Jesus Christ not
[29:29] necessarily truly one God
[29:31] not necessarily the seals the plagues
[29:34] about the the 70s and that it's not that
[29:38] it's when you come to the place
[29:40] that you receive a revelation if you are
[29:43] lost
[29:44] I believe that's a revelation to a
[29:46] sinner that he's lost he needs to be
[29:49] saved
[29:49] that you see there in the scripture and
[29:52] what must we do to be saved all right
[29:54] now here's what the prophet said they
[29:57] asked him what must we do to be saved we
[29:59] tell them about the rules
[30:01] right we tell them to quit this do this
[30:03] do that he said they didn't ask that
[30:05] question they asked how could they be
[30:06] born again
[30:08] and how did Peter say too repent every
[30:11] one of you and be baptized repentance
[30:13] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[30:15] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[30:18] shall receive the gift of the home
[30:20] all right see so you wouldn't get
[30:22] baptized did you you're not even in a
[30:24] promise you're not even a line
[30:26] productive
[30:27] you're not doing it you just
[30:29] I'm trying to make something work
[30:32] but see have you really come through a
[30:34] time that when you remember when you
[30:36] first started and I'm not saying it when
[30:38] I turn the denomination through the bad
[30:39] just imagine this or something that you
[30:41] first believed on the Jesus Christ you
[30:43] first read then
[30:46] well then you could be Sanctified I
[30:48] believe I was I'm honestly I believe
[30:50] after I come to the message of
[30:52] sanctification that I know what happened
[30:54] to me
[30:55] I know that I come to a place
[30:58] I had seen God heard me tell that story
[31:01] but that didn't make me say
[31:03] no way
[31:05] but I'll search for that God
[31:09] and I repented
[31:12] many many times
[31:13] crying out before God
[31:16] wanting that
[31:17] God had come to live in me I believe he
[31:21] come and cleanse me because I didn't
[31:23] have to worry about a lot of the things
[31:24] that was on after I learned what the
[31:26] problem read page 14 15 16 Utah
[31:30] but then when I come into the message
[31:33] and saw what the new birth was and
[31:34] Prophet was saying
[31:37] he's teaching to me and a person comes
[31:39] into you
[31:40] that's the way I see it
[31:42] that a person comes into you to give you
[31:45] a new birth it's not just washing it out
[31:47] cleansing it up making everything good
[31:50] and somebody got to come in
[31:52] come on see then when I seen that I
[31:55] started searching for that for two years
[31:57] a bit more out under the position of
[32:00] receiving the new birth
[32:02] so there's no problem
[32:05] would I not even see that the problem is
[32:07] what we're going to do
[32:09] my precious Faith Peter them three and a
[32:13] half years before they received that
[32:15] light precious faith
[32:18] see he wasn't talking about that he just
[32:20] believed
[32:22] you remember in the later in the
[32:24] scripture take a second remember later
[32:26] in the scripture where he said
[32:28] a more sure word prophecy
[32:31] he was on the mountain with Jesus
[32:33] he's seen all those things he said now
[32:36] I've got a more sure word of Christ look
[32:38] he had an inward experience
[32:42] and the only way the growth development
[32:44] can take place in the sacrament is first
[32:47] and inward experience
[32:50] and then that inward experience you just
[32:52] keep going tonight
[32:53] you pushing anybody else offered
[32:55] anything real quick
[32:58] I just thought about doing this for you
[33:01] know to try to back ends up maybe it
[33:02] could wait and well waited
[33:05] perfect man I'm sure but I wanted to say
[33:09] we need light pressure
[33:11] because that's the way we understand
[33:13] nobody okay you're dismissed
