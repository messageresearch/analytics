[0:04] had a good Christmas weekend
[0:07] yes and we're blessed you know I'm just
[0:12] filling in for the weight again and this
[0:15] morning I want to talk about just run
[0:18] through some quotes about that that
[0:20] might be helpful
[0:21] we'll see what the topic is in a second
[0:23] but listen let's read a few quotes first
[0:27] this this float in the Feast of Trumpets
[0:28] is talking about how the hourly we're
[0:30] living in Boca I'm saying that that
[0:32] clichy asked all the spirits uniting
[0:34] together and bring them all with one
[0:36] thing slaughter to blot out and you can
[0:38] see from this year in 2020 they're
[0:41] having this big alpha conference where
[0:43] all the Muslims and the Buddhists and
[0:45] everything are getting together
[0:46] things are moving together where the
[0:49] World Council of Churches has kind of
[0:51] forming up to you 9mm and you can see
[0:55] that the evil spirits are moving the
[0:57] devil's trying to attack things in the
[0:59] bride he tries to attack it come against
[1:02] things and save on evil we need to have
[1:04] a something just until we stand
[1:07] everything that the devil grows against
[1:10] us what kind of program is talking about
[1:12] here he says now you see what the Beast
[1:13] is don't you just a power comparison and
[1:16] empower ecclesiastical power jesus said
[1:19] in me so close like the real thing we
[1:22] just see they're very elected if it was
[1:24] possible but he promised to have
[1:28] something here for us in that day then
[1:33] we wouldn't be deceived and that's the
[1:35] word and Christ to make it manifest to
[1:38] us
[1:39] no we're just kidding it's getting so
[1:42] close down to that and here's the end
[1:45] where it's a holding down time and
[1:46] that's why you know people are falling
[1:48] waiting people are to see you seems like
[1:50] oh we honestly if you look at the things
[1:53] that people are saying around the
[1:55] message and doing and all that kind of
[1:56] stuff can be very disheartening almost
[1:58] but because it's the time when people
[2:00] are so infused people when they should
[2:02] believe even with church dates 103 more
[2:04] thrived in Toronto they don't know
[2:05] what's up and what's down it's a very
[2:08] deceiving time but God has given us the
[2:12] thing to come back the deception of
[2:14] Atari and giving us the word it would be
[2:18] so close is that within the message is
[2:21] that what it means well we'll see what
[2:26] is the message you got the three kinds
[2:28] of believers are this to hangers-on
[2:29] there's the true believer the make
[2:31] believer and the unbeliever so we were
[2:34] actually listening to the anointed ones
[2:36] on the way to church this morning and
[2:37] then that rug around talked about how
[2:39] the genuine oh the goats can be on
[2:41] someone's spirit but down the inside in
[2:44] their soul they can have they can be a
[2:46] false teacher so that makes them very
[2:48] very Christ they are an anointed one but
[2:51] it makes them a false Christ because
[2:52] they are a stake in their soul they're
[2:55] they're incorrect and so they're that's
[2:58] what's deceiving could they be teaching
[3:04] the truth and then follow away well
[3:10] right somewhere in there is good it's
[3:12] gonna be it's not gonna be bringing
[3:14] forth that the correct teaching of how
[3:17] to be born again the correct teaching
[3:19] and fourth of that falls under their age
[3:20] of how especially in this day that's
[3:24] what I'm gonna get to the message of the
[3:29] hour is more than just
[3:31] born again and so false teachers in this
[3:34] day will not be able to teach that so
[3:37] that's the way that you tell the true
[3:38] and the false in this hour is by the
[3:41] word by preparing the teaching that's
[3:44] coming forth with the teaching of that
[3:47] age to see if it's if it's correct so um
[3:52] we kind of that's really what I'm I want
[3:58] to talk this morning about what the
[4:00] message of the hour is that's what my
[4:02] topic is the message of the hour and
[4:04] what what what it because I feel like so
[4:07] many people are helping misunderstanding
[4:09] of what really the message of the hour
[4:11] is the message of the hour is not just
[4:13] do's and don'ts and you see so many and
[4:19] you come in and they get attracted to
[4:21] the signs and wonders and all those kind
[4:23] of things and as well around be able to
[4:25] discern things and the healing line and
[4:27] all of that and kind of get around kind
[4:30] of just the influence of the message but
[4:32] never really understand what the message
[4:33] of the hour is about and so let me let
[4:39] me read the nice quotes before I kind of
[4:40] go down that route so brother Brown said
[4:45] he was talking about in the Feast of the
[4:49] trumpets about how that that under the
[4:52] sixth seal or the sixth trumpet
[4:54] well the trumpets are under the C seal
[4:57] so under this under this when the sixth
[4:59] trumpet open it out of the bottomless
[5:01] pit came these 100 200 million demons
[5:04] that attack the Jews under Hitler
[5:07] Eichmann Solomon drove them to the
[5:08] promised land and he began to compare
[5:11] that and how the devil's come against
[5:12] the bride also and now in this hour the
[5:15] the Roman system had been held captive
[5:18] at the river Euphrates by preventing
[5:21] them from crossing over to the promises
[5:23] of God because they they were they were
[5:26] they stopped it they had all their
[5:29] traditions and things that bound them at
[5:31] that river and the same way the bride
[5:33] had been kind of
[5:35] seven church ages at by the dogmas and
[5:38] things that that that prevented them
[5:41] from taking the body change and all
[5:43] those kind of things but now here at the
[5:45] culmination things
[5:46] everything's been unleashed and you see
[5:49] these two systems coming against one
[5:50] another so he's saying that that church
[5:53] has bound the Holy Ghost for 2,000 years
[5:55] under mardian back there under the
[5:56] church agents has been bound not of the
[5:58] river of you free trainee but at the
[6:00] door of Crees and dogmas that the Holy
[6:03] Spirit can work in the church because of
[6:05] manmade systems but she is going to be
[6:07] liberated she's coming back that's what
[6:10] the Bible said so that's what the
[6:12] message of the aisle is for to liberate
[6:15] you to cook to come back to the truth
[6:17] that will set you free and we'll talk
[6:20] about that in a second and those two
[6:21] meet up together on the battlegrounds
[6:23] again Luther Lucifer and Michael again
[6:26] like in the beginning they've been bound
[6:27] for 2,000 years almost almost 2,000
[6:31] years so if you're gonna fight in a
[6:33] battle you've got to have something you
[6:34] gotta be equipped to fight that battle
[6:36] and the equipment that God has given us
[6:38] in this age is the message of the hour
[6:40] which is this capstone message the
[6:42] capstone message to equip you to
[6:44] withstand on when the devil comes in and
[6:46] says well the message is false and all
[6:48] this comes to that then you've got the
[6:50] equipment to what stand against that
[6:52] because the devil knows that if the
[6:54] people get the true revelation of the
[6:56] true church and what she is what she
[6:59] stands for it she can do the greater
[7:00] works he will be in a miss long that's a
[7:02] quote we're all very familiar with if
[7:04] they get a true revelation of the two
[7:07] spirits within the framework of the
[7:08] Christian Church and by God's Spirit is
[7:10] earnest
[7:11] the Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[7:13] powerless before he will be as
[7:16] definitely 2a4 to the days when the
[7:18] crisis withstood is every effort to gain
[7:20] power over him in the desert revelation
[7:23] is what gives us power over the devil I
[7:25] feel like you know over the years people
[7:28] have kind of punted and probe to try to
[7:30] get an under to almost force an
[7:32] understanding of the two spirits within
[7:34] the framework of the church but it'll
[7:35] reveal itself in this time and as you
[7:37] grow in grace you begin to understand
[7:39] but just from talking to people what
[7:42] really is driving them and whether or
[7:43] not they're confused and all those kind
[7:45] of things so the message of the app is
[7:49] what I'm talking about because that will
[7:51] give us power over the devil power in
[7:53] this in this date and will liberate us
[7:57] and loose us and allow us to take a body
[7:58] change but look what I kind of want to
[8:01] start off talking about is if you need
[8:04] you need to have revelation - revelation
[8:09] is what will give you will give you the
[8:13] equipment - to combat the things that
[8:17] the devil throws at you in Matthew
[8:20] chapter 16 Jesus told Peter he said thou
[8:23] art Peter and upon this rock I will
[8:24] build my church and the gates of Hell
[8:27] shall not prevail against it no matter
[8:30] what the devil throws all the powers of
[8:32] the other of darkness are no matter what
[8:34] the devil throws at you if you've got a
[8:35] real revelation you're not gonna fall
[8:37] away no slide away
[8:39] you cannot and he said I'll give I don't
[8:43] be able to be the key to the kingdom of
[8:44] heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[8:46] earth shall be loosed shall be bound in
[8:48] heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose
[8:50] on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[8:53] now if gon get it Peter the keys and
[8:56] Peter preached the keys on the day of
[8:58] Pentecost then now you have the keys
[9:01] also and you have the keys which is the
[9:04] revelation of the word then that will
[9:06] loose you from being bound by the things
[9:09] of this world it will give you
[9:11] overcoming power
[9:14] who Matthew chapter 7 he said therefore
[9:16] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[9:19] and doeth them I like it into a wise man
[9:21] which built his house upon a rock and
[9:23] the rain this enough I love you though
[9:26] real simple parables folks because Jesus
[9:28] is saying if you if you get your
[9:30] foundation strength if you build your
[9:32] house upon a rock and then rock is
[9:34] Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ
[9:36] when the winds come and blow against you
[9:38] and beat against you all that all the
[9:41] false doctrine all the different things
[9:42] that people say when if you if you've
[9:45] got a foundation and you're built up on
[9:47] the word the devil cannot swing you off
[9:51] of that rock no matter what comes you
[9:54] are you are convinced that the message
[9:56] that you've heard is true you convinced
[9:58] that Jesus is is your salvation when
[10:02] filled offered will spend enough on rock
[10:18] all right so each each a day each and a
[10:23] message and I think that's that's one
[10:25] thing that we you know maybe forget
[10:28] sometimes is that this age is not the
[10:31] only age that had a message to each each
[10:33] age had a message that call the people
[10:35] out of their denominational system to
[10:37] open up the door so that they could they
[10:39] could rise up higher and escape that the
[10:43] the false doctrine of deranged brother
[10:46] and said what should I do with Jesus
[10:47] called Christ he said he caused all
[10:49] physical death by trying to inject some
[10:51] heresy of segments of the word and
[10:52] that's the same thing that happened
[10:54] not see your own by taking don was
[10:57] instead of the words that's the same
[10:58] thing in the Methodist Baptist
[10:59] Presbyterian as the lights priest forth
[11:02] in each age and they turn it down that's
[11:05] the reason the Lutheran died when Wesley
[11:07] rose up it was in another age the word
[11:10] come forth and they had to accept it or
[11:13] die that's the reason that the
[11:16] Pentecostals are dying now because the
[11:18] age is here so whoever it every age they
[11:22] were at the end of the age
[11:25] a messenger would come on the scene to
[11:27] open the door and the one certain ones
[11:30] would receive that message and then if
[11:32] you reject it down you go
[11:34] you denominated which means which pretty
[11:36] much means you you rejected the message
[11:38] for your day and and from that can no
[11:41] more come any life that's that's where
[11:44] that big day big argument came can you
[11:46] be born again if you're in a
[11:47] denomination everybody wants to argue
[11:50] over that and see it you know you've got
[11:52] ones that there's there's lap overs and
[11:54] things because it's a like FF Bosworth
[11:57] was in the denominator I don't know if
[11:58] he ever saw that burger and was actually
[12:00] a prophet of God I believe he was born
[12:02] again and you got a lap over some things
[12:04] like that but as time goes on the light
[12:07] and the denomination the one as they
[12:08] reject the message the light begins to
[12:10] fade out until brother ever said and the
[12:12] seventh street change he said I left a
[12:14] little light because they look like it
[12:16] was so dark it was completely product
[12:18] out there was only light that was left
[12:20] was in the bride but in other words in
[12:23] the message be out so we're not we're
[12:25] not trying to be critical to point
[12:27] fingers I don't think you born again or
[12:28] whatever but eventually it will get so
[12:30] black that all throughout all the
[12:33] denominational system they'll form
[12:35] together in this world council of
[12:36] churches and it won't be any life left
[12:37] except for in the little bride so that's
[12:40] where the light is and all these
[12:42] messages is the message for each age
[12:44] call people out of that system that they
[12:47] were in as individuals not as a group
[12:50] but each individual had been received
[12:52] for their self and were called out to
[12:54] the message of their age as God
[12:59] brought the church higher and higher and
[13:02] higher by revelation and he said I and
[13:05] why are we not a denomination I believe
[13:06] that God has dealt in each age but did
[13:08] you ever notice they every time a church
[13:10] ever fails and as soon as they
[13:12] denominated a start failing or Idina and
[13:15] whenever they fail God never raises that
[13:17] church again and I mean it goes right
[13:19] straight to see if you want to know the
[13:22] history on that we can produce that that
[13:24] no church not ever in the history of
[13:26] churches has a denomination ever fail
[13:29] ever rose again Baptist Methodist
[13:32] Presbyterian Luther and whatever maybe
[13:34] when they fail they are gone God deals
[13:38] with individuals and not with the
[13:39] denomination and he keeps talking about
[13:41] that they see because as you're going up
[13:45] this is what is talking about the the
[13:46] porter the porter is the messenger for
[13:48] that age that preaches a message that
[13:50] opens the door for them to come out of
[13:52] that age to come out of the teaching of
[13:55] that age and program said that here's
[13:57] what happened if you know the original
[13:58] custom when a bridegroom's it gives out
[14:00] invitations for his away he just gives
[14:02] out so many of the patients and for
[14:05] every invitation he sent you had a
[14:06] porter standing at the door to put a
[14:09] robe on so they rode the people that car
[14:11] coming out coming through that door they
[14:14] rode them with the righteousness of
[14:15] Jesus Christ because they believed the
[14:17] message for that age so so let me ask
[14:22] you this question our believers in EJ is
[14:25] born again how are they how's it going
[14:27] in now really I mean really becomes
[14:32] confusing for a lot of people when you
[14:34] look at Luther and Wesley and then and
[14:37] then Pentecost because we get in our
[14:39] minds that well these people Paul will
[14:42] born again by justification
[14:44] sanctification the baptism the Holy
[14:46] Ghost the three stages but you can get
[14:48] in your mind well because Luther
[14:50] preached justification then he didn't
[14:51] see sanctification of the baptism the
[14:53] Holy Ghost Oh Micah teaching this
[14:58] morning is that everybody throughout all
[15:01] seven church ages came through those
[15:03] three stages from justification
[15:05] sanctification aback simogo in other
[15:08] words they heard the message for their
[15:10] age
[15:10] they believe to justification the
[15:12] unclean spirit went out and then God
[15:15] quicker the word that they heard for
[15:17] their age they had to go through
[15:19] everybody had to go through three stages
[15:22] whether it was Paul I read is Martin
[15:26] Luther Wesley the restoration of the
[15:30] gifts at Azusa Street and then eight the
[15:34] capstone message now you got to get
[15:37] those those numbers right because
[15:39] everything falls into this right pattern
[15:41] that's why brother Dale has been
[15:43] hammering on the soap for so many years
[15:45] that the messenger comes at the end of
[15:47] the age all arenas Martin Luther Wesley
[15:54] Azusa Street and then at the end of that
[15:58] a mezuzah Street of Pentecost the
[16:00] restoration of the gifts brother Branham
[16:02] preached his message which is what
[16:04] there's so much confusion about what was
[16:08] the message of the Alpha the message of
[16:10] the hour is not you must be mourning it
[16:13] this is the message of the hour
[16:17] the message of the hour is work for the
[16:19] round priest to give our body change to
[16:21] give it to give us faith to think a body
[16:23] change so everybody gets caught up in
[16:26] the clothes and the hair and the dress
[16:28] and all those kind of things which is
[16:31] something that that was restored it's
[16:33] part of the preaching of the message to
[16:34] try to understanding those kind of
[16:36] things but that is part of it that you
[16:38] must be born again
[16:39] but the message goes beyond you must be
[16:42] born again
[16:43] so down to the seven churches is what
[16:46] what got eaten damn was it because we
[16:49] looked at Luther and Wesleyan and the
[16:51] Baptist moment goes to presumes a
[16:52] strength and so we know that all of
[16:55] those people were born again by going
[16:57] through those that's three stages of
[16:59] justification sanctification the
[17:02] baptismal ghost
[17:04] they knew how to be born again so what
[17:06] got eaten down and what had to be
[17:08] restored the Joel it talks about the
[17:12] floors shall be full weed and the
[17:14] fashion overflow the 101 all and I will
[17:18] restore to you the years that the locust
[17:20] have eaten the cake the worm and the
[17:22] caterpillar and the paw worm my great
[17:25] army which I said among brother bring
[17:28] preached all of those sermons about
[17:29] about how the bribery will be restored
[17:32] the bribery is this tree and what was
[17:35] restored with now remember brother brown
[17:38] talk talk about that on the day of
[17:40] Pentecost that the word that the
[17:43] Apostles had heard for three and a half
[17:44] years was quickened and boom they shot
[17:47] up to brotherly kindness all the way to
[17:50] the top not the capstone because the
[17:52] capstone was rejected if they had
[17:54] received the capstone then they would
[17:56] have taken a body change so they got all
[17:58] of these virtues and they had all these
[18:00] virtues but down through the seven
[18:01] churches Roman dogma and all of those
[18:05] kind of things crypt in and that word
[18:07] that they heard the revelation of all
[18:09] these things was eaten down until he got
[18:12] just down to the to the roof but the
[18:14] room was still there the route was if
[18:17] you if they be eaten away in the route
[18:19] which they could not have done but then
[18:21] then how would the how would the life
[18:22] have come back but you know even in the
[18:25] yard if you if you cut a tree down if
[18:27] the groups still there you gotta watch
[18:29] it because it it's gonna spring back up
[18:31] exactly what happened in this situation
[18:33] and the Bible says in Joel I will
[18:36] restores and and and what brain is at
[18:39] restoration by is was the prompt this
[18:42] message to restores back to the original
[18:45] teaching that was lost down through the
[18:47] cemetery canes
[18:48] what was that original teacher well
[18:51] first of all that that that you need to
[18:53] grow up the stench of a perfect man now
[18:55] a lot of people are the baddest aware
[18:57] how a pro but the adoption that kind
[18:59] like that but they kind of probe at it
[19:01] but nobody can put it together like
[19:03] brother Branham did because he missed
[19:05] over two everything that was lost the
[19:07] true who Jesus living through the
[19:09] understanding of the Godhead true
[19:11] understanding of baptism all these kind
[19:13] of things to get us prepped to get us
[19:15] ready for his message which was preached
[19:18] to 1963 and and beyond I don't like
[19:28] contests on this between you know the
[19:30] fivefold ministry in every age preached
[19:34] the message that their messenger priests
[19:37] and every age there their mandate was to
[19:40] preach what their messenger preached so
[19:44] the true thoughtful ministry in this age
[19:46] will be preaching this right here and
[19:51] and I think sometimes some of the
[19:53] fivefold ministry not it's not the
[19:55] critique or nothing but the fivefold
[19:57] ministry is not called just to preach a
[20:00] watered-down message for another age
[20:02] that we just need to be born again or
[20:04] almost preaching like like a dr. Phil or
[20:06] dr. Dobson time message that we need to
[20:09] get our family straightened up and we
[20:11] need to you know if we didn't love one
[20:12] another in those kind of things which
[20:14] all that is needful and all that's good
[20:16] but the truth I hold ministry will be
[20:19] preaching the message that brother
[20:21] Branham preached which is all of this
[20:25] and all this I mean everything that was
[20:28] revealed in the seven seals everything
[20:30] after that
[20:31] who is this milk is attack across the
[20:34] mystery God revealed all of those kind
[20:35] of things that said that opens up the
[20:38] book of Revelation the book of
[20:40] Revelation is the bronze book and that
[20:42] book can never be understood in its
[20:45] entirety count to seven church ages
[20:47] until this
[20:49] message came you can open it up and I
[20:51] you know I don't believe you that and
[20:55] even met me in the early church thing
[20:57] Paul had no understanding of what the
[20:59] seven lampstands were the seven spirits
[21:02] before God the white robe judge coming
[21:05] down all of all of those kind of things
[21:07] and no understanding and they could just
[21:09] probe out it until until this doesn't in
[21:12] my brain said God said Luther with the
[21:15] word the Lutheran's spoke for God at
[21:17] that time but they organized and again
[21:19] the pure word was lost for organization
[21:21] tends toward dog many Creed's and not a
[21:23] simple word they can no longer speak for
[21:26] God then God sent Wesley and he was the
[21:28] voice with the word in his day the
[21:30] people who took his revelation from God
[21:31] became two living epistles read and
[21:33] known a man for all of all men for their
[21:36] generation when the myth of this failed
[21:38] God raised up others and so it has gone
[21:40] on for the years until in this last day
[21:43] there is in and other people in the land
[21:46] under their messengers will be who under
[21:49] their messenger will be the final voice
[21:51] to a final age because they're preaching
[21:54] the same thing now I'm just kind of
[21:58] going to skim through some of these
[21:59] things we know that Elijah will do two
[22:01] things turn the hearts of the children
[22:03] to their fathers reveal restore all
[22:08] these things and then reveal the
[22:10] mysteries of the seven thunders which is
[22:12] his message your message will forerun
[22:17] the second coming of Christ was what the
[22:20] man was told so you got I'm just gonna
[22:26] can skim through these these are all
[22:27] patterns that were for me aware that
[22:29] that the Elijah the John the Baptist was
[22:33] for running Christ which is the full
[22:35] revelation of God and just in this day
[22:39] the program was to forerun the second
[22:41] coming which is he's not coming in
[22:43] person but he's coming and bride to
[22:46] fulfill to bring the fullness of God
[22:48] manifest in us
[22:51] [Music]
[23:01] you don't get tired all right what we
[23:06] did we just got a few more minutes and
[23:08] then we'll take the year of Jubilee that
[23:10] brother brother Dale in different ones
[23:12] always always bring out is so important
[23:14] to understand what the message is it
[23:17] seems a little bit deep and you kind of
[23:19] you know when you start talking about
[23:21] numbers and everything I know people's
[23:23] eyes get a little droopy but it is the
[23:27] villainous 25/8 it says I'm just gonna
[23:31] talk about this and maybe close that
[23:33] shop number seven sabbaths of years
[23:35] under these seven times seven years and
[23:37] the space of the seven thousand subs
[23:39] year shall be under the forty and nine
[23:41] years that shot calls the trumpet of the
[23:44] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[23:46] seventh month in the day of atonement
[23:48] shall you to make the trumpet sound
[23:50] throughout all your land in other words
[23:53] at the end of every seven years they
[23:56] have a little shimmy to where you could
[23:57] part a part of the thing that's going to
[23:59] go free
[24:00] just like at the end of every step every
[24:02] Church ages the trumpet would sound and
[24:06] the people in that age could go free but
[24:10] not completely another word you they
[24:12] couldn't go free with a body change and
[24:14] that's what this after 49 years the
[24:20] trumpet sounds that you can go
[24:21] completely free and other than the
[24:24] fiftieth year you have complete
[24:26] deliverance and that's why the year of
[24:29] Jubilee is so important to message
[24:30] believe understanding this understanding
[24:32] what the message is because when when
[24:36] the to revision done in the promised
[24:37] land which was maybe maybe you know
[24:41] around this timeframe
[24:42] I'm just an estimate they every forty
[24:46] nine years
[24:46] did you believe trumpet should have been
[24:49] bald maybe that I don't think they
[24:51] really
[24:52] did that and then they can go free so
[24:56] you can kind of see now if those in the
[24:58] the seventh month of the 49th year which
[25:02] is important for understanding how this
[25:04] pattern fits in together 7 & 8 which
[25:10] even on the day of Pentecost the eighth
[25:12] day was also the fiftieth that's why
[25:14] it's called Pentecost so the whole thing
[25:17] started out on each day on the day of
[25:20] Pentecost and because it was on Sunday
[25:22] the 8th day and on the 50 which was the
[25:25] fiftieth day after the resurrection well
[25:27] it all finishes up awesome after 49
[25:29] years
[25:30] 7 times 7 7 times 7 is 49 weather around
[25:34] preached a message in the 49 to give us
[25:37] complete deliverance so that we could go
[25:40] into the 50 the benefits 25 begins with
[25:45] an eighth year got the perks God because
[25:48] of Jubilee ever 49th year the 50th year
[25:50] was the Jubilee we know that we
[25:52] understand that from the first two early
[25:53] of Leviticus 25 80 in 1977 will be the
[25:57] 70th Julian making exactly 3400 it going
[26:01] up the release so what is the year of
[26:04] release everybody can go free regardless
[26:08] of what you have done when you hear the
[26:10] message that brother preached and the
[26:13] 49th year it gives the release to not
[26:19] just your soul you know to the seven
[26:21] churches every every shemitah they had a
[26:23] release of their soul to believe the
[26:25] message for their age but a complete
[26:27] deliverance of your soul or spirit and
[26:30] your body regardless of what you're
[26:34] doing
[26:35] that's why brother I appreciation
[26:37] divorce if you can believe that my grace
[26:40] amazing divorce that God has given to
[26:41] you all of the things that you've done
[26:43] in your body will be covered over by the
[26:47] grace that God has given that's why it's
[26:50] so important to get a revelation of all
[26:52] these things in the capstone
[26:54] because the capstone message was a was a
[26:56] Jubilee message to give us faith there
[27:00] all that stuff that's homeless down
[27:01] thinking that we're not good enough and
[27:03] all that we're not but God has given us
[27:06] grace to take a body change full
[27:10] redemption of soul spirit and body
[27:12] because Hebrews 4:12 says that they did
[27:15] it lays out that there's three different
[27:18] parts of you piercing even to the
[27:20] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[27:23] of the joints and marrow and is a
[27:25] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[27:27] the heart
[27:30] let me just kind of scan through some of
[27:32] this thing
[27:37] I'm not going to get through this
[27:45] Berkeley to go yeah let's uh I don't
[27:51] wanna get into this we're really get
[27:54] for you so listen let's just stop
[27:56] right there
[27:56] and then we'll go upstairs
[28:00] [Music]
