[32:08] an adult that will be responsible for
[32:11] you
[32:12] okay just to keep everything safe all
[32:15] right so you love the Lord amen we're
[32:18] going to continue on with that what we
[32:20] were talking on Sunday written in our
[32:23] heart or the heart means the soul it's
[32:27] the very soul of you it's very it's what
[32:29] it's the very fiber of your being it's
[32:31] what you are you are a
[32:33] soul you just got here by a body BR Mom
[32:37] and Daddy brought you here but God give
[32:39] you a soul and then you have to
[32:41] determine you have to determine where
[32:43] that Soul goes now we know by
[32:45] predestination God knew by for knowledge
[32:48] who would and who would not so you still
[32:50] have a choice amen but the very seed of
[32:53] God is God and when you come to that
[32:57] then you you are a part of God and the
[33:00] word of God is written in your
[33:02] heart not in a sinner's heart it's
[33:04] written in your heart cuz you know we're
[33:07] going to speak a little bit this morning
[33:10] about a mystery there was a mystery that
[33:13] began in the Book of Genesis that we're
[33:16] going to
[33:17] see the
[33:19] Fulfillment of that right
[33:23] here we are the people who the ends of
[33:26] the world have come upon
[33:28] let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you
[33:30] for today thank you for the people Lord
[33:33] that's here Lord let us all hear from
[33:35] you today Father let it not be just the
[33:38] words of Mind Lord but Lord you know
[33:41] we've been thinking about this for the
[33:43] since Wednesday night with our brother
[33:44] Lord and we we're not I don't think
[33:48] we're catching that who we really are
[33:51] and the prophet of God told us that if
[33:52] the bride will realize who she is and
[33:54] what she's doing here that she'll be an
[33:56] invincible Army Satan won't know what to
[33:58] do with us if we create create a world
[34:04] that he don't know anything about and
[34:06] that's in our heart because Lord when
[34:09] you gave us a
[34:12] birth we got a
[34:15] soul but Lord when you gave us a new
[34:17] birth you didn't take that one out you
[34:21] cleaned that one up the unclean Spirit
[34:24] was gone out of the soul of person and
[34:26] you came and inhabited so Satan can
[34:28] never inhabit that again but we know
[34:31] that he can inhabit the spirit of man
[34:33] and he can beat on this flesh father we
[34:36] realize that and know that and if we
[34:38] know how to handle that Lord I think
[34:39] we'll do a lot better Lord be with the
[34:42] ones that are sick the ones that have
[34:43] come and told us that they were sick and
[34:46] going to be watching in different ones
[34:47] Lord I pray that you'd be with them
[34:49] touch their body forgive us of our
[34:51] faults and failures Lord thank you for
[34:53] the day that we're living in thank you
[34:54] for the word that we have and I pray
[34:56] that you'll anoint it at this moment
[34:58] Lord for the people and all of us say
[35:02] amen amen God bless
[35:06] you first Corinthians but it is written
[35:09] I have not seen nor ear heard neither
[35:11] entered into the heart of man the things
[35:12] which God hath prepared for them that
[35:16] Agape him not felo him that Agape him
[35:21] that love him with no restraint that
[35:23] love him with all their
[35:26] heart regardless of circumstances
[35:28] regardless if you're on your back in a
[35:30] hospital come on
[35:33] somebody we're a group of people who
[35:35] have to believe something we've never
[35:38] seen and then realize that it's right
[35:41] here it's not a way off it's right here
[35:44] it's something that we can that we have
[35:46] already inside of us that we can pull
[35:48] from that resource all right we'll get
[35:50] to that just a minute but God hath
[35:52] revealed them unto who Us by his spirit
[35:56] for the spirit searches all things
[35:58] yay the Deep things of God you may be
[35:59] seated in the Lord add his Blessing to
[36:01] the reading the word I'll finish reading
[36:02] this and get to my point for what man
[36:04] knoweth the things of a man save the
[36:06] spirit of man which is in him even so
[36:09] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[36:11] spirit of God now we have received now
[36:14] watch Paul says now we have received not
[36:17] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[36:19] which is of god now we were born with an
[36:21] adamic adamic Adam the old Adam nature
[36:24] you were born with a nature contrary to
[36:27] God everybody with me all right then by
[36:31] the new birth God comes in and burns
[36:33] that old nature out of you and puts
[36:36] himself
[36:38] inside all right so that's the new birth
[36:41] that's the spirit of God now we have
[36:43] receive not the spirit of the world but
[36:45] the spirit which is of god that we might
[36:47] know why why were we given the spirit of
[36:50] God to know the things of God to know
[36:54] how to handle things even if we have
[36:55] heartaches and trials and troubles we
[36:57] know how to handle them or we know how
[36:59] to go to the scripture and the scripture
[37:01] talks back to us and helps us handle
[37:03] those things everybody with me so that
[37:06] we might know the things that are what
[37:07] freely given to us of God there is no
[37:10] restraint with what God can give us
[37:12] except what we restrain ourself
[37:15] everybody with me all right we're our
[37:17] worst enemy you're our own we are Our
[37:20] Own Worst
[37:22] Enemy okay well just pray for me then 2
[37:25] Corinthians 3:2 says ye are our our
[37:27] epistle this is where we was talking
[37:29] about last Sunday written in our hearts
[37:32] now there's not a there's not an ink pen
[37:34] and God's inside of your heart and he's
[37:35] writing stuff no listen you're the very
[37:38] fiber of what has been written amen
[37:41] you're the very makeup of what this
[37:43] Bible is it flows not through your veins
[37:46] as your natural blood but through the
[37:48] spirit that's in you that's now the
[37:50] spirit of God somebody say Amen it's the
[37:53] spirit of God that flows through you now
[37:56] uh I have blood that's regular human
[37:59] blood Jesus had regular blood now it
[38:01] wasn't human blood it was but it was
[38:03] God's blood we know that but brother R
[38:05] said it wasn't the blood that Sav it's
[38:07] the life that's what saved you the blood
[38:10] keeps you clean you keep looking back
[38:11] and that blood keeps covering us
[38:12] everybody with me all right it's the
[38:14] life it's the life that's inside of you
[38:16] that's worth more than 10,000 worlds as
[38:19] as brother randam
[38:20] said but you are written our epistle
[38:24] written in our hearts known and read of
[38:25] all men
[38:27] written means to engrave or inscribe or
[38:29] record now I like that word
[38:32] record there's a recording brother B
[38:34] said it starts when you come to the age
[38:35] of accountability there is a there is a
[38:38] recorder started and it records you
[38:41] until you get born
[38:44] again then when you get born again
[38:47] that's
[38:48] erased praise God that's where it goes
[38:50] It goes in the sea of God forgiveness he
[38:52] can't remember your past sins if he does
[38:55] he can judge you amen if you receive
[38:58] Christ in your heart today and he gives
[39:01] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're
[39:03] just as Eternal as God is you're just as
[39:05] perfect as God is we just don't
[39:06] understand that cuz we have all that
[39:08] Spirit realm and Satan beating on us say
[39:11] no you're not you did this you did that
[39:13] you did this you did that I told you
[39:15] many times the Sea of God's
[39:16] forgetfulness he put a place that he
[39:18] can't even go to yes sir and that's
[39:20] where my sins went amen that's why I
[39:23] tell you many many times that when we
[39:25] when we uh testify be careful don't
[39:28] bring back old stuff right that's gone
[39:31] that's right right that's gone don't
[39:32] bring back old stuff testify what's God
[39:35] doing to you
[39:37] now everybody with
[39:39] me so he's engraved if we're engraved in
[39:42] the palm of his hand then he's engraved
[39:45] in our heart yes and there's no way when
[39:47] you get the new birth there's no way he
[39:49] can erase that
[39:52] Absolut praise
[39:54] God for as much as you are manifestly
[39:56] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[39:58] what is an epistle it's send one a
[40:01] message because these are Epistles that
[40:03] go that John wrote us Corinthians
[40:05] Ephesians all the different ones God
[40:07] wrote through Paul he gave us Epistles
[40:10] something written down but remember Paul
[40:12] said the letter
[40:15] kth right remember that the letter will
[40:18] kill you we was talking to brother Dutch
[40:20] last night we went eat with them and and
[40:22] sister uh April and if we keep just
[40:27] reading the
[40:29] letter it will kill
[40:32] you that's why I said this it's got to
[40:34] be written in your
[40:35] heart not written on a piece of paper
[40:38] now you got to read the piece of paper
[40:39] because we're human beings I just
[40:41] reading a quote back there where brother
[40:42] R said Jesus was the fullness of the
[40:45] godhead B amen he was the word and what
[40:48] he spoke is in here amen now what you
[40:53] speak as a human is not in
[40:55] here but what he spoke is in here
[40:58] everybody with me amen all right now
[41:00] where is he at
[41:02] today by the Holy Ghost he's inside of
[41:06] you now that don't do away with you
[41:08] having to not read the word anymore
[41:12] don't get to that point please don't
[41:14] don't get to that point where you say I
[41:15] got it all no he was the fullness of the
[41:18] godhead bodily you are a part of it not
[41:22] all of
[41:23] it right some of you male some female
[41:26] some pastors some evangelists some
[41:28] prophets some teachers but everybody in
[41:31] Collective together makes the body of
[41:35] Christ and what does he work through I'm
[41:37] going to read it in a little bit he said
[41:39] I am the vine you are the branches now
[41:41] remember the vine doesn't bear
[41:45] fruit but it has the life that goes to
[41:48] the
[41:49] branches and that's where the fruit is
[41:52] that's where you and I are yes we're not
[41:55] the vine we're part of the Vine Vine cuz
[41:58] Jesus told us he said now if you're not
[42:00] of me he said you're cut off and cast
[42:03] into fire in other words you're going to
[42:05] the day of judgment and you're not going
[42:06] to make it to heaven but you and I by
[42:08] the new birth we are already sitting in
[42:11] Heavenly
[42:12] places written Epistles yes we do have
[42:16] to study we do have to read the Bible
[42:18] but you don't have to go to the Bible
[42:20] every second to live your
[42:23] life with me you don't have to carry
[42:26] this with you everywhere you
[42:28] go it would be nice but it would be
[42:31] absolutely I'm sorry it would be
[42:34] cumbersome they have to carry this thing
[42:36] around I remember when we were in school
[42:38] we were in home
[42:39] e yeah they had it back in the
[42:42] 70
[42:44] anyway we actually cooked and ovens and
[42:46] all that stuff you know it wasn't even a
[42:48] microwave back then I don't
[42:50] think but the teacher there she said all
[42:53] right all you girls and guys I want you
[42:56] to go bring me a five gallon I mean a 5B
[42:59] bag of
[43:00] flour so we all went and bought 5B bag
[43:03] of flour she says okay she said I want
[43:07] you to carry
[43:08] that every
[43:11] day if I see you in the hallway you need
[43:14] to have that 5B bag of
[43:16] flour the point she's trying to make is
[43:18] was especially to the girls was that's a
[43:22] baby and you got 5 lbs of a baby you got
[43:25] to haul around and take care of make
[43:26] sure it don't fall fall and bust make
[43:27] sure all these but it was a good point
[43:29] that's the same way with this we don't
[43:31] have to carry this around it should be
[43:33] written in your heart and you should
[43:35] listen you should be able to if somebody
[43:38] says something you should be able to at
[43:40] least remember something about a
[43:41] scripture that you read in the Bible
[43:43] that relates to
[43:44] that come
[43:47] on that's written
[43:49] Epistles that's the letters that Paul
[43:52] wrote to the Corinthians but it wasn't
[43:55] just to the Corinthians it was to us
[43:57] it still is to us so now look written
[44:02] not with ink all right so the letter
[44:05] kth that's why we were talking about
[44:07] last night you you can read you can read
[44:10] quotes and you can tear the message
[44:15] apart give me a quote like brother Dale
[44:18] said give me a quote he said just give
[44:20] me a little while he said I'll find one
[44:21] that sounds contrary to that by the
[44:24] written word amen right but that's not
[44:28] the continuity of God God's not in
[44:30] confusion that's right so whatever comes
[44:32] out of the word of God has got to what
[44:33] it's got to Ping with it every time
[44:35] that's right every time it's got to be
[44:37] right there with it every single time
[44:39] that's why God had to send us a prophet
[44:41] and we believe he was a prophet for the
[44:42] end time we believe that we had to get
[44:45] it through him because we were
[44:47] confused all of
[44:49] us the denominations were
[44:54] confused so even brother random comes
[44:57] and he gives us 1100 sermons we have all
[44:59] the books downstairs we got books in our
[45:01] library and we got books all over the
[45:03] place everybody with me don't even have
[45:06] them anymore you got them on your phone
[45:07] I mean on your watch and your
[45:09] phone right they quit printing books you
[45:13] know that right there's no printing
[45:14] press in Jeffersonville anymore they
[45:16] quit printing It's All Digital now so
[45:19] you can have it in a moment in an
[45:21] instant you can have it anywhere you
[45:22] want to your computer or anywhere you
[45:24] can pull up a quote but we can't be a
[45:27] bunch of quote
[45:30] quoters people have stood right here in
[45:32] this Pulpit at fellowship or ministers
[45:34] meeting and quoted brother brandham and
[45:37] it totally be contrary to what we're
[45:38] talking about in the fellowship in the
[45:40] ministers meeting right brother
[45:42] Aaron read a quote
[45:46] absolutely and they have declare their
[45:49] Doctrine by that
[45:51] quote and it seemed contrary to what we
[45:53] were talking
[45:55] about the subject
[45:58] matter right same
[46:00] book same
[46:03] Prophet I want you to think that's good
[46:05] that you're quiet you need to think
[46:07] about this I have pretty much I know Dad
[46:10] does he had all 1100 sermons in book
[46:13] form CU he got them from Brother David
[46:14] mamus and different ones he just got
[46:16] this huge library right and they're and
[46:20] and they're they're written in so many
[46:22] times till you can't hardly read it but
[46:23] he
[46:24] could but see that was the part that we
[46:27] had to go
[46:28] through everybody with me everybody had
[46:31] you've got to go through that part where
[46:33] that this means more to you and you you
[46:35] know God don't mind if you Mark Mark the
[46:38] Bible up a little
[46:39] bit that kind of proves that you've
[46:43] readed a little bit when everything
[46:44] starts falling
[46:47] apart God don't God don't mind that but
[46:51] what have you done with what's on that
[46:53] paper it's the whole mystery that we're
[46:56] going to talk about in just a few
[46:57] minutes the whole mystery is is how you
[47:00] can produce what's on that page and not
[47:02] have to carry that Bible with
[47:04] you everybody with me you've got that's
[47:08] Christianity in the
[47:10] message is that you live what you've
[47:13] been taught and you can live it to the
[47:17] tea now Jesus he never missed it a day
[47:21] did he he never missed it an hour they
[47:23] never caught him wrong amen never so if
[47:26] that Ministry is what brother Brandon
[47:28] brought to us which is the ministry of
[47:29] the son of man then we should be able to
[47:31] bring it to you pure and
[47:35] unadulterated okay you that's impossible
[47:37] well you become an unbeliever cuz I
[47:39] believe it I believe the fullness of the
[47:41] godhead bodily is in the bride we're
[47:42] going to read it here a little bit later
[47:43] on and she is fulfilling what Jesus did
[47:47] and said 2,000 years ago right here on
[47:50] Earth today all
[47:52] right because of the opening of the
[47:55] furtherment of the word because of the
[47:57] unwritten part that brother randam told
[47:58] about looking inside the pyramid because
[48:01] of the opening of the seals you and I
[48:03] are in a place that no one has ever been
[48:06] before I hath not seen and ear hath not
[48:09] heard nor entered into the heart of man
[48:12] what God in other words what God's got
[48:13] for us not going to bring us he's
[48:16] already brought it right if we just
[48:19] believe what's already brought that'll
[48:21] take us to a body change
[48:27] not in tables of stone that's where they
[48:29] wrote that's what they wrote on some
[48:30] back then but in fleshly tables of the
[48:33] heart you're going to send a message to
[48:36] the
[48:37] world Listen the world wants to know
[48:40] where God
[48:42] is now they might have a different God I
[48:45] heard a preacher a couple days ago and
[48:47] he wasn't a message
[48:50] preacher he said you know he said Buddha
[48:53] Buddha Buddha's final words cuz there's
[48:55] Buddhist right there there's a a sect or
[48:58] a religion called Buddhism all right
[49:01] Buddha final words recorded by the
[49:04] people that were with him was I have not
[49:08] done everything I want to do and then he
[49:12] died so he died incomplete so they have
[49:16] an incomplete
[49:17] word Muhammad died his body is laying in
[49:22] the grave and they know
[49:24] that but praise God y we have a man that
[49:28] sat one day on a cross and he said it is
[49:36] finished and we don't go visit a tomb
[49:39] where there's a horse and a man waiting
[49:42] on him to get
[49:43] up we serve a Risen Lord that's inside
[49:47] of our hearts written in our
[49:51] heart thank God for this religion we
[49:54] have I think Dutch was telling us last
[49:56] night and maybe some of y'all that work
[49:58] with AI they plugged in Christianity and
[50:00] they plugged in Buddhism they plugged in
[50:02] Jehovah Witness they plugged in all the
[50:04] different not Jehovah yeah and they
[50:06] plugged in all the different
[50:08] denominations Christianity came out on
[50:11] top just by artificial intelligence that
[50:14] everything fit more than the others
[50:17] fit everybody with me just Common Man by
[50:20] a computer when they put all the
[50:21] information in brother John Buddhism
[50:24] missed that because he didn't complete
[50:25] everything
[50:31] [Music]
[50:56] letter that he actually wrote cuz listen
[50:59] Jesus stood one day and he said thank
[51:01] you Father he thanked the heavenly
[51:04] father that he spoke in a way nobody
[51:07] would understand him but just a few
[51:10] people and you and I are that few
[51:14] people continue on Paul says not of the
[51:17] letter but of the spirit for the letter
[51:19] kth but the spirit giveth life because
[51:24] remember let just say it this way if you
[51:27] continue with re just the letter of the
[51:29] message and letter of the Bible you
[51:33] can't live
[51:35] it you can't live it there's no way you
[51:38] can live
[51:40] it that's got to come off the page
[51:43] inside of
[51:45] you that's why brother R had to come to
[51:47] straighten the things out like no
[51:49] eternal hell who in the world preached
[51:51] that there was a body change for Abraham
[51:52] and Sarah it was plainly in the Bible
[51:56] but nobody knew that God through a
[51:58] prophet gave us what the unwritten word
[52:01] and you know what now that is in your
[52:03] heart because when we say Abraham and
[52:04] Sarah you immediately would think in
[52:07] your
[52:08] mind they took a body
[52:10] change but now you tell that to a
[52:12] Baptist and they look at you
[52:16] cross-eyed yeah they never heard of that
[52:17] never heard of something like that
[52:23] before that's because we have the
[52:25] message of the hour
[52:27] the unwritten part sure we have 1100
[52:30] sermons but I've told you many times
[52:32] before if we don't get the essence of
[52:33] this message you missed
[52:36] it cuz you can like I said you can read
[52:39] where brother Brown and you know what
[52:40] Jesus was telling them right here they
[52:42] said oh Moses gave a writing of
[52:44] divorcement and and and so and so and so
[52:46] and so and Jesus said it wasn't so from
[52:48] the beginning that's right he said in
[52:51] other words if we' have stayed with that
[52:52] we're all dead he said but because of
[52:55] the hardness of your heart heart he said
[52:58] in other words I'll give you a Grace
[53:01] amen praise God for
[53:03] that same thing with everything
[53:05] Christianity can you live that Bible
[53:09] no but you can if you get the essence of
[53:14] it we know that we live a daily life but
[53:17] we also know that we have a Rudder or a
[53:20] a TI poost that we can go to that will
[53:23] move us to where we need to go where we
[53:25] need to be
[53:26] right so we have a spiritual Rudder that
[53:29] tells us which way to go and listen if
[53:33] we start down a road that we're not
[53:34] supposed to be on come on somebody you
[53:36] pray for
[53:37] me if you start down a road that you
[53:39] shouldn't be going down something stops
[53:42] you that's
[53:45] God oh my well you blah blah blah you
[53:48] want
[53:49] to if it wasn't for the grace of God
[53:51] you'd all be dead you'd all be dead in
[53:54] your sins and trespasses and some of you
[53:55] would already be be dead
[54:00] physically I say some of y'all I mean me
[54:04] included I appreciate you um your
[54:07] confidence to have me one more year so
[54:10] it's all of us folks it ain't just one
[54:12] it's all of us never is going to be one
[54:15] person
[54:19] no they I I was telling somebody the
[54:21] other day I
[54:24] said if you preach the gospel that's
[54:26] good but you got to deal with people as
[54:29] individuals even when dad always said he
[54:31] said remember he said I'm preaching to
[54:32] your soul he's not preaching to your
[54:36] personality brother Dell told us years
[54:39] and years ago he said I'm looking and
[54:40] preaching at your soul he said God has
[54:42] given me enough in other words the
[54:45] anointing of of discernment not to
[54:47] discern that oh Regina you in the you in
[54:50] the liquor store
[54:53] yesterday she might have been
[54:56] she was talking to somebody I hope help
[55:00] me say Amen thank you okay thought I
[55:04] used the wrong
[55:06] person sometimes you know they say that
[55:08] a Baptist will talk to you except if
[55:10] you're in the liquor store with them so
[55:12] anyway but Matthew
[55:14] 11:25 let's continue on but thank you
[55:17] very much I appreciate it just if you uh
[55:20] if you have any concerns just speak with
[55:22] me I would appreciate it and uh and
[55:25] we'll get through this thing May
[55:26] maybe I love you all but God has G did
[55:30] give a pastor enough discernment not to
[55:32] know like I said exactly like what
[55:34] brother randam had but I'm going to read
[55:36] to you in just a few minutes that
[55:37] discernment message that he brought
[55:40] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[55:41] the heart that's what broke
[55:44] loose into the bride that the word can
[55:47] do that not just me saying and you
[55:50] responding that's what brother BR was
[55:52] now see he would look at him say now you
[55:54] were yesterday you were the hospital the
[55:57] guy had on glasses I mean he was just so
[55:59] vivid you know but we don't have to be
[56:01] that now we have to be where we can see
[56:04] as an
[56:06] overview and you can see people that
[56:08] struggle it's like brother Dell always
[56:11] said he said if you're happy let your
[56:12] face show it amen if you're
[56:15] not that's
[56:18] right
[56:21] amen oh at that time Jesus answered and
[56:24] said at that time I thank the old father
[56:26] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[56:28] has hid these things from the wise and
[56:29] prudence and this listen Jesus said and
[56:32] we should be aware that this is the way
[56:35] it's going to
[56:36] be this is the way it's going to be cuz
[56:40] Jesus said you have hid these things
[56:43] what these things these
[56:44] mysteries from everybody but
[56:48] babes right that's what he said right
[56:50] there you can read it and has revealed
[56:53] them now what is revealed something
[56:55] previously hid has been opened up and
[56:57] made known all right something
[57:00] previously hid that's been opened up and
[57:02] you can see what's going on we for many
[57:04] many years we saw what happened in the
[57:06] garden they told us it was an apple they
[57:09] told us it was a pomegranate they told
[57:11] us it was some kind of fruit but now
[57:13] listen you don't have to go back to the
[57:15] Bible here's your written part you don't
[57:18] if you have a revelation of what
[57:19] happened in the garden you don't have to
[57:21] go back and verbatim read
[57:24] that cuz you know the essence of what
[57:27] happened Amen brother Ram had to he had
[57:30] to preach it but you and I I mean do we
[57:34] need to preach what happened in the
[57:38] garden do we anybody I mean honestly if
[57:42] what happened in the garden you don't
[57:43] get that then that's Genesis that's the
[57:46] beginning of everything all right and
[57:48] you ought to know by now after you get a
[57:49] little bit age on you you know that's
[57:51] the problem
[57:53] anyway praise the Lord
[57:57] so now it's the unwritten part you have
[57:59] a revelation from God that's in the
[58:02] Bible but now it's in your
[58:04] heart and listen can anybody take that
[58:07] away from
[58:10] you brother Dell always said you can get
[58:12] them in with a hun dog somebody get them
[58:14] out with a hamburger in other words what
[58:15] is it somebody got them in with this but
[58:17] got them out with that if you ever get a
[58:20] revelation no one can get you out the
[58:24] devil can't get you out he sealed out of
[58:26] your soul I want us to understand that
[58:29] let our soul that's what I said many
[58:31] many times ago let that thing start
[58:33] working we've bound it so many years you
[58:35] say oh no I don't brother R said that
[58:38] the Holy Spirit has been bound by Creeds
[58:41] and dogmas for 2,000 years amen but it's
[58:44] now been loosed on an end time bride
[58:46] that's loose in other words yeah there's
[58:48] 200,000,000 demons they're out there we
[58:50] swept a lot of them coming to church
[58:52] today everybody with me but there's more
[58:57] and we'll just defeat them too sir God
[58:59] give us the grace to do
[59:02] it but what do that do it puts you
[59:05] closer to
[59:08] God it should when you
[59:11] realize God came and gave
[59:14] something to you
[59:16] personally God I mean I'm talking about
[59:18] God the master of the universe any of
[59:21] y'all go outside and see those seven
[59:22] star seven planets line
[59:25] up oh you missed it that's an event that
[59:27] didn't won't happen for hundreds and
[59:29] more years all in the southwest Sky
[59:31] there was seven seven seven seven
[59:34] planets lined
[59:37] up remember God said brother Bown said
[59:41] something will happen and God will prove
[59:43] it and you know that February the 28th
[59:45] is when that happened that was just a
[59:47] couple days ago that when the cloud came
[59:49] down in
[59:50] Arizona and gave what gave us a sign
[59:55] yeah that Christ is here
[59:57] now he's not over the
[1:00:01] sea Matthew
[1:00:04] 13:1 he answered and said unto them
[1:00:07] because it is given unto you now look
[1:00:09] you who's he talking to talking to his
[1:00:13] disciples it is given unto you to know
[1:00:15] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[1:00:17] so here we go there's a
[1:00:20] requirement it's given unto you to know
[1:00:22] the
[1:00:23] Mysteries but to them it's not
[1:00:27] given have you ever talk to somebody
[1:00:29] about a doctrine that you that we that
[1:00:31] you know we we've all done it if you've
[1:00:34] been anywhere and anybody's been around
[1:00:36] any kind of person that's religious
[1:00:38] sometimes they'll say something and
[1:00:40] you'll make a comment and they've never
[1:00:42] heard that
[1:00:44] before right that's but to you you
[1:00:48] didn't have to go back and get a
[1:00:51] book you didn't have to go get a a a
[1:00:54] quote book you didn't even have to get
[1:00:56] the Bible amen you ought to be able to
[1:00:58] just boom run right through water
[1:01:03] baptism right I did that one time not
[1:01:06] too long
[1:01:08] ago and
[1:01:11] uh there was some people sting in the
[1:01:13] congregation that that didn't believe
[1:01:15] that and
[1:01:17] uh I told him I said there's your Bible
[1:01:20] I said pick your Bible up and read it I
[1:01:21] said if you can find anybody's ever been
[1:01:22] baptized in the titles father son holy
[1:01:24] ghost in the Bible I said you know how
[1:01:26] brother Brown said that he said I'll put
[1:01:28] a false prophet you know I'll put a sign
[1:01:30] on my back and you ought to see the
[1:01:32] people here they go they go they're
[1:01:34] trying to find
[1:01:36] it Well they never found it like like
[1:01:39] Aaron said ain't
[1:01:42] there in good old southern English it
[1:01:44] ain't there sir but do they believe it I
[1:01:48] don't know but to us it's just when it's
[1:01:52] like Mom said one time mom said when I
[1:01:54] saw water baptism
[1:01:58] I think it was Mom or somebody
[1:02:00] said and i' never seen you know name
[1:02:03] name now you can go back to Genesis and
[1:02:07] you see in my name in my name in my name
[1:02:10] the whole family of God is in my name
[1:02:12] the cast out devils in my name be
[1:02:15] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:02:18] of the son and of the Holy Ghost my name
[1:02:20] is in them name you've never seen that
[1:02:24] before but if you got something in you
[1:02:27] that's responding to it you'll search
[1:02:29] and when you search God's got it
[1:02:32] here I want us to realize when God wrote
[1:02:34] this Bible he wrote it knowing the day
[1:02:37] that you would sit down and have get a
[1:02:40] revelation that that's exactly what it
[1:02:42] was and he was so happy didn't matter if
[1:02:45] he had to write it through an Old
[1:02:46] Testament Saint Old Testament Prophet
[1:02:48] New Testament Prophet didn't matter who
[1:02:50] he wrote it
[1:02:51] through but it was for me and you yes
[1:02:54] sir
[1:02:56] those prophets Jesus told us those
[1:02:58] prophets would love to see their word be
[1:03:01] made manifest in a group of people they
[1:03:03] never saw it before today it is spoken
[1:03:07] and it is written Epistles you and I
[1:03:10] yes and they read you every day
[1:03:14] amen I read you like
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:18] a you can hide a lot but you get to know
[1:03:21] somebody and know their actions and they
[1:03:23] this and that and the other yeah you
[1:03:25] pretty much got cuz you can't hide not
[1:03:27] in this age this is the age of
[1:03:29] Revelation everything's coming out all
[1:03:31] the things are coming out everything's
[1:03:32] being revealed Romans
[1:03:35] 16:25 now to him that is of power to
[1:03:38] establish you according to my gospel the
[1:03:40] preaching of Jesus Christ and the
[1:03:42] preaching according to the revelation of
[1:03:44] the mystery which was Kept Secret since
[1:03:48] the world
[1:03:50] began I hope some of y'all are
[1:03:53] praying if you're not your asleep
[1:04:00] I'm just going to believe you're
[1:04:07] praying which was kept now this is this
[1:04:10] is Romans this is Paul getting a
[1:04:12] revelation from God to bring it to me
[1:04:14] and you this is the way I see the whole
[1:04:16] Bible I see it's written Paul Paul
[1:04:18] grabbed it Paul grabbed the mind of God
[1:04:22] and he wrote that physically wrote These
[1:04:24] are letters yes right that was written
[1:04:26] on pieces of paper to the
[1:04:29] Romans but not only to the Romans to be
[1:04:32] you yes sir to the
[1:04:35] Gentiles he said according to the
[1:04:37] revelation of the mystery which was Kept
[1:04:39] Secret since the world
[1:04:44] began now if it kept if it's kept secret
[1:04:47] since the world
[1:04:48] began we need to go back to Genesis and
[1:04:52] find out what that mystery is Right amen
[1:04:55] that's what that's what Jesus said right
[1:04:56] or Paul said we know it was God writing
[1:04:58] it we know it was Jesus but now it's
[1:05:01] made manifest now Paul has grabbed it
[1:05:03] and brought it down to his time to his
[1:05:05] day but now is made manifest and by the
[1:05:09] scriptures of the
[1:05:13] prophets remember there was no new
[1:05:14] testament he was writing it right then
[1:05:17] he went to the Old Testament and got
[1:05:19] what he's writing today or then but it's
[1:05:23] now made manifest and by the scriptures
[1:05:25] of the prop prophets according to the
[1:05:27] Commandment of the Everlasting God made
[1:05:29] known to All Nations for The Obedience
[1:05:32] of
[1:05:34] Faith First Corinthians now all these
[1:05:37] things now watch
[1:05:39] all all means all all these things
[1:05:42] happened unto them New Old Testament
[1:05:45] because this is Paul writing all right
[1:05:47] everybody with me amen for
[1:05:51] examples and they are written for our
[1:05:54] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:05:57] world are come now that was
[1:06:01] Paul
[1:06:02] 194 something years
[1:06:06] ago right I think we might be just a
[1:06:10] little bit closer than that
[1:06:12] today so he's not not only written it to
[1:06:15] them because they're in the grave he's
[1:06:16] written it to you because we're
[1:06:19] alive right
[1:06:21] right what was this great Secret
[1:06:26] he said since the world began there's a
[1:06:28] mystery that God has kept in his mind
[1:06:32] before the foundation of the world but
[1:06:35] it's getting ready to make that word
[1:06:37] made
[1:06:38] manifest so if you want to I can quote
[1:06:41] it you can go to Genesis
[1:06:44] 1:26 now listen God had created all
[1:06:47] animal life world water plants animals
[1:06:53] he standing there one day and he said
[1:06:55] let us make man in our own
[1:06:59] image after our
[1:07:01] likeness and let
[1:07:04] them multiply let them have
[1:07:09] dominion now
[1:07:12] listen that scripture was not
[1:07:18] known cuz a commentary commentaries that
[1:07:20] I've read from people that are not in
[1:07:23] the message that was all mankind they
[1:07:25] they say that was every person that was
[1:07:27] Adolf Hitler that was you know whoever
[1:07:30] that was just God made this made man
[1:07:32] right cuz remember man was made on the
[1:07:36] sixth day right but they don't
[1:07:39] understand the great mystery is that if
[1:07:41] there had not been a fall only the bride
[1:07:44] would have come forth only God's
[1:07:48] children or his progyny or his own DNA
[1:07:54] is in that right there
[1:07:57] right and then he took brother randam a
[1:07:59] prophet to come he said now that was not
[1:08:00] all man right in other words that was a
[1:08:05] special class of people
[1:08:07] right made them in theophany he goes
[1:08:10] through the whole thing tells how that
[1:08:12] then Adam was put in flesh and God put
[1:08:14] that spirit inside of Adam and then he
[1:08:17] was supposed to be the listen to me the
[1:08:21] mystery
[1:08:22] Giver
[1:08:23] right amen he was supposed to be able to
[1:08:26] explain that mystery CU he had the mind
[1:08:29] of God there W no preachers around to
[1:08:32] muddle him up it was him and God Amen
[1:08:35] but we know what happened so there's no
[1:08:37] way that that could come to pass
[1:08:40] immediately but it's going to come to
[1:08:42] pass because God spoke it right now you
[1:08:45] read Genesis
[1:08:47] 126 in the
[1:08:49] beginning then God made male and female
[1:08:52] created he them you understand all that
[1:08:54] got it right
[1:08:56] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:08:57] the Sea and the foul the and that's what
[1:08:59] Adam had until the fall happened and
[1:09:01] that cut that off the Genesis 126 man
[1:09:04] had to be had to go back into a
[1:09:08] mystery in other words the book was
[1:09:11] closed right no one in the Old Testament
[1:09:15] could even
[1:09:16] Proclaim Moses may have had a little
[1:09:20] idea of what was going on but he didn't
[1:09:22] have the revelation of the mystery
[1:09:25] right even though the great Moses talked
[1:09:29] to God lift the ear God held that right
[1:09:31] there right he held that and he spoke it
[1:09:37] Moses wrote it down but you and
[1:09:41] I see this right here is to the who the
[1:09:44] ends of the world have come
[1:09:47] upon God brought the mystery before the
[1:09:50] foundation of the world listen this
[1:09:52] genesis6 man was not made on the six
[1:09:56] day right hello come on wake
[1:10:00] up on the sixth day no that was man that
[1:10:03] was when God put that into somebody that
[1:10:06] come up out of the ground and put that
[1:10:08] into Adam this one never had a beginning
[1:10:12] this never had an
[1:10:15] end they never had a beginning but God
[1:10:18] had to bring it to a
[1:10:20] point to where he said let us make man
[1:10:23] in our own image
[1:10:25] it was a mystery what's he talking
[1:10:29] about listen folks Satan was standing
[1:10:33] there when that
[1:10:36] happened this was created oh come on
[1:10:40] this was created in the mind of God
[1:10:41] before the foundational World Satan had
[1:10:43] no idea who this
[1:10:46] is he had no idea this is a secret God
[1:10:50] help from
[1:10:52] eternity this was already this was
[1:10:54] before Satan
[1:10:56] yes this was before the
[1:10:59] devil he created you in His image and
[1:11:03] hid you in a
[1:11:05] mystery a great mystery that only a
[1:11:08] prophet in the end time could reopen
[1:11:10] this book by the Holy Ghost by the what
[1:11:14] son of man Ministry because in Luke they
[1:11:18] handed Jesus a
[1:11:19] scroll well they really rejoiced about
[1:11:21] that in Honduras when we had the
[1:11:23] ministers meeting they' hadd never seen
[1:11:24] that before remember in Luke when Jesus
[1:11:27] sat down in front of all the religious
[1:11:30] people of the world at the time he was
[1:11:33] in a temple they handed him a scroll and
[1:11:36] it was
[1:11:37] closed he sat down he opened the
[1:11:40] book and went right to the spot and
[1:11:43] identified who he was but remember when
[1:11:45] he gave it back to him he didn't leave
[1:11:47] it open that's right he closed it back
[1:11:49] read your scripture he closed it back
[1:11:52] and handed it to them as a closed book
[1:11:55] right amen that's right he did that for
[1:11:58] a
[1:11:59] purpose he did that to keep it
[1:12:02] sealed so that the religious world would
[1:12:05] not know even who he was cuz he
[1:12:09] declared listen if you ever watch the
[1:12:11] the the series Chosen Jesus was pretty
[1:12:14] much a calm guy until remember this
[1:12:18] scene go back and watch this scene cuz
[1:12:21] he's sitting in the temple they hand him
[1:12:23] the scroll he open opens it and he looks
[1:12:26] at him and he said the spirit of the
[1:12:28] Lord is upon me and he made it so real
[1:12:30] till it
[1:12:31] was and afterwards then that's when they
[1:12:34] started throwing him out of the temple
[1:12:35] they started calling him belb they
[1:12:37] started they started really unraveling
[1:12:39] you know and Jesus said it's going to
[1:12:41] get rough it's going to get rough after
[1:12:43] this when you when when God unveils
[1:12:47] himself in me and you it's going to get
[1:12:50] rough it even got rough when he birthed
[1:12:53] you into his body amen
[1:12:56] if it was flowery bed of EAS pray for me
[1:12:58] I got the wrong
[1:12:59] one it got worse lost
[1:13:03] friends persecuted by family not my side
[1:13:07] but Jim's
[1:13:08] side everybody with
[1:13:12] me hard to get to church right
[1:13:15] Amy struggle in a fight to do the things
[1:13:18] of
[1:13:19] God how many you get up in the morning
[1:13:21] and before you even go in to the
[1:13:23] bathroom you open the Bible start
[1:13:25] reading I didn't think
[1:13:33] so pretty clothes ain't good enough only
[1:13:36] in horses shoes and hang
[1:13:39] grenades see what I
[1:13:41] mean that's not what we
[1:13:44] do we don't do that because we are
[1:13:48] human but that Genesis 126 man during
[1:13:51] the day somewhere will call your
[1:13:53] attention Lord come on
[1:13:55] he'll call your attention to
[1:13:58] something every day of your life yeah
[1:14:00] every day of your life if you're a real
[1:14:02] Christian walking in the word of God
[1:14:04] something Sparks your either Sparks your
[1:14:07] Revelation or Sparks you to go to a
[1:14:09] scripture or Sparks you to speak
[1:14:13] one are
[1:14:14] singing that's a Christian Life is able
[1:14:18] to be able to do that every single
[1:14:21] day oh yeah when you got a headache when
[1:14:23] you don't want to that's my point right
[1:14:27] that's what I said about that when you
[1:14:28] get up out of bed you you you want to go
[1:14:31] right in there and start preaching no
[1:14:34] you got to get up you got to get them as
[1:14:37] brother rown said get the matter out of
[1:14:38] your
[1:14:39] eyes right brush your teeth maybe put
[1:14:42] your teeth in the rest of
[1:14:44] us but we do all these things and then
[1:14:48] the word of God comes prevalent in our
[1:14:50] life we read our Bible in the morning or
[1:14:52] do whatever but somewhere during that
[1:14:53] day even if you don't do it in the
[1:14:54] morning sometime during the day
[1:14:56] something's going to come to you that's
[1:14:57] the unwritten part that's why I say you
[1:14:59] don't have to carry this around with you
[1:15:00] all the
[1:15:02] time sisters I'm talking to you
[1:15:05] too you should know enough to tell
[1:15:08] people why you dress the way you dressed
[1:15:10] and why you act the way you act without
[1:15:12] having to say brother R
[1:15:15] said cuz brother R didn't come to give
[1:15:17] us and preach to us Holiness it was
[1:15:21] already in the Bible people had forgot
[1:15:23] to preach it right
[1:15:27] misinterpreted theology is what killed
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:32] people so the greatest secret mystery is
[1:15:36] that God is going to dwell in a human
[1:15:39] being yes he's going to dwell in human
[1:15:42] flesh he's going to be prevalent in
[1:15:47] human
[1:15:48] flesh come on hallelujah we're he's
[1:15:51] going to be the center of our being
[1:15:54] absolutely
[1:15:57] right listen to
[1:15:59] this when the current is Flowing freely
[1:16:02] the word of God it expresses itself this
[1:16:04] is Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:16:05] The Works that I do shall you do
[1:16:08] also and in the last days it shall come
[1:16:10] to
[1:16:11] pass behold I send to you Elijah the
[1:16:14] prophet now watch what he's he's setting
[1:16:15] up watch behold I send you Elijah the
[1:16:18] prophet and he shall turn the hearts of
[1:16:19] the children back to the faith of the
[1:16:21] fathers that was his first part of his
[1:16:23] ministry he knew that because the Seal's
[1:16:25] already broke now he knew what the
[1:16:27] second part
[1:16:28] was
[1:16:31] and and in
[1:16:34] there what in that first part of the
[1:16:36] ministry will come a new ministry that
[1:16:39] we've been talking about it'll come a
[1:16:40] new ministry and in there there would be
[1:16:44] a Time come forth when he could express
[1:16:46] himself in fullness of his godhead deity
[1:16:50] through his
[1:16:52] church right have preeminent
[1:16:55] in this church am oh my what the
[1:16:58] anointed man now the anointed
[1:17:02] people people bride yes that Genesis 126
[1:17:07] man has
[1:17:09] multiplied and it's replenishing the
[1:17:12] Earth and it will come to a day that
[1:17:14] we'll in other words we'll have dominion
[1:17:16] over this Earth First that we're coming
[1:17:19] back in the Millennium and have a
[1:17:20] dominion over this earth
[1:17:23] physical amen but we got to have it over
[1:17:26] this one first everybody with
[1:17:29] me oh my the anointed man now the
[1:17:32] anointed people oh my what to do to

[1:17:45] transfer onto into the
[1:17:46] bride right everybody with me anointed

[1:18:05] catch the part the devil's trying to
[1:18:07] tell you and you'll say I don't want
[1:18:09] that anymore Eve accepted it and then
[1:18:11] Adam accepted what Eve did all right
[1:18:12] everybody with me now listen the second
[1:18:15] Adam and the second Eve is not going to
[1:18:16] fall because why the second Eve is going
[1:18:19] to say that ain't nothing but the
[1:18:22] truth and God is going to be so
[1:18:24] prevalent in our life that you can't
[1:18:26] tell the two
[1:18:28] apart come on
[1:18:32] somebody same scripture that speaks of
[1:18:34] the what bridegroom speaks of the Bride
[1:18:37] she is him yes it took a prophet to
[1:18:41] break the airwaves to tell us that's who
[1:18:43] we
[1:18:44] are we're him in another form called a
[1:18:48] bride and that's what he wants and he's
[1:18:51] so happy with that why can't we be happy
[1:18:54] with
[1:18:55] why can't we be raising our hands and
[1:18:57] and being
[1:18:58] freedom to be able to worship god listen
[1:19:02] you worship him through the word first
[1:19:05] amen right you worship him through the
[1:19:07] word first but there should be an
[1:19:09] anointing come that they can't nobody
[1:19:11] keep their hand
[1:19:14] down for you able to raise your hand and
[1:19:16] say oh thank God I am free free free

[1:19:23] in the blood
[1:19:26] amen he said my word is spirit so take
[1:19:28] it off of this page and put it inside of
[1:19:32] you that's what he wants that's what he
[1:19:35] has ordained before the foundation of
[1:19:37] the world that Genesis 126 man is not
[1:19:40] separate from God it's the same God in
[1:19:43] another form called a
[1:19:45] bride the same person if
[1:19:49] not oh oh for a second person
[1:19:55] we're the
[1:19:57] devil amen there's only one God there's
[1:20:02] only one bride that's so full of the
[1:20:04] groom till you can't tell the two
[1:20:09] apart what he turned down he comes back
[1:20:13] and we accept
[1:20:15] it yes John
[1:20:18] 15:4 abide in me and I in you as the
[1:20:21] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:20:23] except it abide in the vine so you got
[1:20:26] to be connected to the right Vine that's
[1:20:29] where the life comes from it's root vine
[1:20:33] branch our root trunk Branch every way
[1:20:37] you want to say it because there's no
[1:20:39] fruit on that tree apple tree in the
[1:20:43] trunk but there's but but potentially
[1:20:46] there is that's where that life comes
[1:20:48] out that's can you imagine you look at
[1:20:52] God and you wonder how God does things
[1:20:54] things well just look at nature you
[1:20:57] plant one apple seed
[1:21:01] one there's not interjected any other
[1:21:05] seed get this there's not interjected
[1:21:08] any other seed but in that one seed when
[1:21:11] I planted those apple trees 20 something
[1:21:14] years ago there's been hundreds of
[1:21:16] thousands of apples come out of that one
[1:21:18] little bitty
[1:21:21] seed talk about the multiplication of
[1:21:23] God just at nature you plant corn you
[1:21:26] plant one corn you get 7 or
[1:21:29] 800 corn ears two ears to a stalk
[1:21:32] sometimes three if you're lucky and then
[1:21:34] you plant each one of them and they
[1:21:37] bring forth 800 to a th000 you plant
[1:21:40] them 800 and each one of them brings
[1:21:42] four that's the multiplication of God
[1:21:44] that's when God said let us make man in
[1:21:46] our image I
[1:21:48] you I'm not going to
[1:21:51] fail these people are not going to fail
[1:21:55] they're going to be me because I
[1:21:57] declared them to be me I'm going to tell
[1:22:00] you today you are the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:03] Christ which is God in another form
[1:22:06] called a bride the fullness of the
[1:22:07] godhead B is not in brother
[1:22:10] Michael that was
[1:22:13] Jesus whatever we got in here today
[1:22:16] you're a collection of
[1:22:20] that abide in me and I in you as a
[1:22:23] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:22:25] except to divide abide in the vine no
[1:22:28] more can ye except you abide in me this
[1:22:31] is red letter so I put it in red letter
[1:22:34] I am the
[1:22:36] vine you are the branches don't
[1:22:39] interject yourself and say you're the
[1:22:41] vine no you out of your place right I am
[1:22:44] the vine you are the branches he that
[1:22:47] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:22:50] bringeth forth much fruit Genesis 1:26
[1:22:54] said be
[1:22:56] fruitful be fruitful and multiply and
[1:22:59] replenish the
[1:23:02] Earth the same bringing forth much fruit
[1:23:06] for without me you can do
[1:23:09] nothing without me you can do nothing
[1:23:12] without Jesus Christ you can't do this
[1:23:15] you're right you can't do this but if
[1:23:17] you'll let him live through you
[1:23:21] amen now remember Brother D preached
[1:23:24] many many years ago about the Book of
[1:23:27] Revelations and he told
[1:23:29] us he said that's the bride's
[1:23:32] book right some of you weren't here but
[1:23:37] he preached many Ser he preached a big
[1:23:39] long series on the Book of Revelations
[1:23:42] and he said that's the bride's book why
[1:23:44] we're the only people to understand it
[1:23:46] it's written to us for us and to be
[1:23:49] revealed listen to us and through US
[1:23:54] amen not just to us but through
[1:23:57] us now the Greek word for
[1:23:59] Revelation is
[1:24:01] apocalypse which means unveiling this
[1:24:04] unveiling is perfectly described in the
[1:24:06] example of a sculptor unveiling his work
[1:24:08] of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker
[1:24:11] it is an uncovering revealing what was
[1:24:13] previously
[1:24:15] hidden now listen the uncovering is not
[1:24:18] only the revelation of the person of
[1:24:20] Christ but it's the revelation of his
[1:24:23] future work in the oncoming seven Church
[1:24:26] ages what is that bride he's now moved
[1:24:29] into bride form and that's how he's
[1:24:32] revealing or giving Revelation is to the
[1:24:37] bride do you believe that
[1:24:40] am then I'm going to read this one more
[1:24:42] time because I I I believe it and until
[1:24:44] we get to where we can can live it we
[1:24:46] need to keep reading
[1:24:47] it I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[1:24:50] Spirit to give us Revelation or we'll
[1:24:52] fail to get it bringing these two
[1:24:54] thoughts together you'll see that it
[1:24:56] won't take just ordinary
[1:24:58] study and
[1:25:00] thinking to make this book real right
[1:25:04] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:25:05] Holy Ghost that means that when you read
[1:25:08] something something quickens in your
[1:25:11] heart and you either want to read it
[1:25:13] again or you want to dive a little bit
[1:25:16] deeper now if that doesn't if that
[1:25:18] doesn't if that's not part of your life
[1:25:20] you need the new birth listen the new
[1:25:22] birth groans for the word word to be
[1:25:24] brought to
[1:25:26] him brother said the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:28] waiting in
[1:25:31] you for you to bring in the
[1:25:34] word so he can Quicken
[1:25:37] it you can't Quicken the word and be
[1:25:40] lost you got to be part of the word you
[1:25:42] got to be part of the one that wrote it
[1:25:44] you got to have his mind and when you
[1:25:46] got his mind you can look through your
[1:25:48] eyes into the Bible and you can see that
[1:25:51] Unwritten part that Unwritten part
[1:25:52] that's for you that's for you and me
[1:25:55] amen it won't take ordinary study and
[1:25:58] thinking to make this book
[1:25:59] real it's going to take the operation of
[1:26:02] the Holy
[1:26:03] Ghost now like brother Aaron said
[1:26:06] Wednesday night he said it's not in the
[1:26:08] shouting that's all After Effects yes
[1:26:11] sir and we love it we love the worship
[1:26:14] we I believe our worship has got up a
[1:26:16] little bit more than it used to be we're
[1:26:19] more free to be able to express yourself
[1:26:22] but you're not expressing yourself
[1:26:24] you're expressing Jesus Christ and then
[1:26:27] he's happy about it so he's going to
[1:26:29] just pour it
[1:26:31] on listen we bind the Holy Ghost is that
[1:26:34] right we bind him that's why I said when
[1:26:38] you walk through that door you don't
[1:26:39] have to hit the door but when you come
[1:26:42] that through that door you ought to shed
[1:26:43] all them demons we was talking about and
[1:26:45] come in here at least with maybe just a
[1:26:46] few of
[1:26:48] them cuz some people going to come in
[1:26:49] here with them
[1:26:52] anyway cuz remember you either leave
[1:26:54] Better or Worse brother R say so if you
[1:26:55] leave worse you took them demons in and
[1:26:57] you taking them back out listen this is
[1:26:59] a place for
[1:27:01] deliverance and not just to deliver us
[1:27:03] to pray for somebody and the hair pins
[1:27:04] go flying everywhere that's okay they've
[1:27:06] had their time but I want somebody to
[1:27:08] stand here and say I have been changed
[1:27:12] by the word of God that you brother
[1:27:14] Aaron Brother Louise and brother Bob
[1:27:16] preach in this church I have been
[1:27:19] delivered by that
[1:27:24] and I don't think leaving brother R's
[1:27:26] name out he bothered that bothered him
[1:27:28] one
[1:27:29] bit CU in the days of the
[1:27:32] voice of the seventh
[1:27:34] angel even God give it to a special
[1:27:37] class of people brother R says that
[1:27:39] means this book can't be revealed to
[1:27:41] anyone now watch
[1:27:43] anyone but a special class of people it
[1:27:46] will take one with prophetic Insight
[1:27:49] what is prophetic Insight is being able
[1:27:50] to look at something and know what it is
[1:27:54] without having to read it three or four
[1:27:56] times amen I know we do that I know we
[1:27:59] how many of you have read scripture and
[1:28:01] then somebody got up read one the other
[1:28:03] day brother bobber somebody read one in
[1:28:04] Corinthians and I I could have swore i'
[1:28:06] never heard that in my
[1:28:08] life right well pray for me I know it
[1:28:11] don't happen to y'all I'm me I'm the one
[1:28:13] that's a ratch up here I guess cuz
[1:28:14] everybody's
[1:28:18] like I mean really have we read books
[1:28:22] listen to tapes amen and somebody come
[1:28:25] right here brother Dale was good at
[1:28:26] reading quotes he read many quotes he'd
[1:28:28] read a quote out of the church age book
[1:28:30] and you're
[1:28:31] like I just read that last week and I
[1:28:34] didn't get that you know what it wasn't
[1:28:35] your
[1:28:36] time that's why this Bible is only 66
[1:28:39] books there only like 20 something
[1:28:41] thousand words in here that's the
[1:28:43] Eternal Word of God and I'm holding it
[1:28:44] right here in my hand but what is it
[1:28:47] it's an unfolding of every word you can
[1:28:50] read through read it read it read it
[1:28:52] read it I read Corinthians 100 times
[1:28:55] but when that brother read it whoever
[1:28:57] when it was read it several weeks ago
[1:29:00] I'm like man that just fits with what
[1:29:02] I've been thinking about
[1:29:05] and that's
[1:29:07] God that's God revealing it when you
[1:29:10] need it he knows he can't pour it all in
[1:29:12] you at one
[1:29:13] time he said cuz you can't stand it
[1:29:17] that's why brother Ram it took him 1,00
[1:29:19] sermons to bring us and how many
[1:29:21] thousands of sermons we preach from that
[1:29:24] say we from 65 when he passed away till
[1:29:27] today there's probably been millions of
[1:29:30] sermons preached from those 1100 some of
[1:29:33] their own opinion some of the truth
[1:29:37] everybody with me right but it only be
[1:29:40] given to a special class of people it
[1:29:42] will take one with prophetic Insight it
[1:29:44] will require the ability to hear from
[1:29:46] God you say I'm just I'm too young Now
[1:29:50] read that in the Bible to
[1:29:51] me he said you got to come as a babe
[1:29:54] didn't Jesus say you got to come as a
[1:29:55] babe to understand who I am understand
[1:29:57] the kingdom let you come as a kid reveal
[1:30:01] it to babes and then we grow up it will
[1:30:04] require Supernatural instruction not
[1:30:06] just a student comparing verse with
[1:30:08] verse though that is good but a mystery
[1:30:10] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:30:13] it never becomes clear that's why you
[1:30:15] need a five-fold Ministry that's filled
[1:30:17] with the spirit of God that Taps into
[1:30:19] every resource they have you bring an
[1:30:21] evangelist here he's not going to preach
[1:30:23] to you marriage in
[1:30:25] divorce he's going to lift you up or
[1:30:27] he's going to expose some kind of sin
[1:30:28] that you have or something in your life
[1:30:30] that and make the people happy that's
[1:30:32] what a that's what an evangelist does
[1:30:35] pastor preaches on the things like that
[1:30:37] different ones a prophet comes in cleans
[1:30:39] the place up they got different things
[1:30:42] you know amen but a mystery requires the
[1:30:44] teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:30:46] becomes
[1:30:50] clear how we need to hear from God and
[1:30:54] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[1:30:56] the spirit to hear now watch to hear and
[1:31:00] to know not just here the letter kth but
[1:31:05] the spirit giveth
[1:31:07] life remember the Lord
[1:31:09] 1963 we were talking about this last
[1:31:13] Sunday but
[1:31:15] remember there are certain things in the
[1:31:17] message and that's what we're going to
[1:31:18] get to with the with the third PLL and
[1:31:20] all the different seals and different
[1:31:21] things there's a requirement
[1:31:24] amen that you get this this is the age
[1:31:28] for it this is the Revelation time for
[1:31:30] it this is God speaking to you I'm not
[1:31:33] speaking to you today I hope God's
[1:31:35] speaking to your heart
[1:31:36] somewhere but listen if there's anything
[1:31:38] lacking with us let's get back to that
[1:31:41] let's remember what he required not what
[1:31:44] we think we ought to
[1:31:47] have well if I was God I'd do it this
[1:31:50] way well you ain't God and you do it
[1:31:52] wrong cuz God don't make a mistake God
[1:31:55] God's perfect so let's just yield oursel
[1:31:58] to him
[1:32:00] okay not what we think we ought to have
[1:32:03] but what he said we've got to have we
[1:32:06] got to have it that way the way that he
[1:32:08] said it now let me bring you an example
[1:32:10] how many of you here today if I could
[1:32:12] come here and bring a bring a um a good
[1:32:14] denominational I'm talking about a good
[1:32:16] teacher and let him teach you about
[1:32:21] Trinity now if it changes your mind
[1:32:25] you don't have the mind of God yeah
[1:32:26] right you got a
[1:32:28] problem if he can change your mind
[1:32:30] that's the hamburger and the hot
[1:32:32] dog but if you get the real revelation
[1:32:34] of the spirit of God what has it become
[1:32:36] it has become
[1:32:38] you you have become the mystery that
[1:32:42] God's talking about in Genesis 126
[1:32:44] because Genesis 126 is only a special
[1:32:46] class of
[1:32:48] people I just believe that that's why I
[1:32:51] love Genesis 126 because I look at it
[1:32:54] I see
[1:32:55] it I see it in other brothers and
[1:32:57] sisters and churches and different
[1:32:58] places I see that Genesis 1 126 man
[1:33:01] being unfolded I pray today that you see
[1:33:04] that you're part of that Genesis 126 man
[1:33:07] that you have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:33:09] soul and that you are an invincible Army
[1:33:13] and that you can defeat the Devil yes
[1:33:16] not by yourself but with that you can
[1:33:19] defeat listen that Genesis 126 man Satan
[1:33:23] is still don't know what that
[1:33:26] is I'm
[1:33:28] sorry he don't know what that
[1:33:30] is oh he might have an idea let us make
[1:33:34] man in our own image God what are you
[1:33:37] talking about you know I can see God he
[1:33:39] says now devil you I gave you you you
[1:33:42] you open the
[1:33:44] Service you you're the worship Angel you
[1:33:46] open the service and I'll handle the
[1:33:48] preaching but now what Satan want to do
[1:33:51] Satan wanted to preach cuz he did
[1:33:54] remember he preached to Eve pretty
[1:33:57] convincing and he also preached to
[1:34:00] angels and they took his lie and that's
[1:34:03] who's here today trying to give you that
[1:34:06] lie all right
[1:34:08] am brother Ram said look the Lord told
[1:34:11] him if you'll continue to be sincere and
[1:34:13] humble it'll grow greater and greater
[1:34:15] now this ministry is going to step
[1:34:16] higher now into another realm who'll be
[1:34:18] far beyond what it is now he got this
[1:34:22] idea I didn't say idea he got this
[1:34:24] Revelation in 1958 but he didn't get the
[1:34:26] whole
[1:34:27] Revelation that's right I read y'all the
[1:34:29] other day he he comes through 1958 to
[1:34:31] 1960 and he thinks it's something
[1:34:34] according to prayer lines and according
[1:34:36] to to what he saw in the vision of the
[1:34:38] tent and all that he thought it was
[1:34:39] going to be something greater coming
[1:34:41] through but he realized though and later
[1:34:43] in the spoken words Original Seed
[1:34:45] different ones
[1:34:46] 1962 he knew what that new ministry was
[1:34:50] he says in here I'll not read it for
[1:34:52] time we'll we'll close he said it's not
[1:34:55] in the discernment right justart from it
[1:34:58] it's not in the discernment part now
[1:35:00] listen he never lost that
[1:35:03] discernment listen
[1:35:05] today his message is still
[1:35:09] Discerning we were talking about those
[1:35:10] people that have that have left the
[1:35:14] message they couldn't number one be born
[1:35:16] again you know that right but they have
[1:35:19] absolutely they have nowhere else to go
[1:35:22] right so so they turn to drinking and
[1:35:25] they go right back out in the world
[1:35:27] there's only a few one or two that even
[1:35:29] goes to church anymore why there's
[1:35:32] nothing else to do how are you going to
[1:35:33] get something if you come to here and
[1:35:35] you got the
[1:35:36] Cadillac how you going to go back to the
[1:35:40] bicycle I'm sorry but how you going you
[1:35:42] get in the fullness here and you going
[1:35:44] to go back to part you never knew what
[1:35:47] this was to begin with I hope today we
[1:35:50] understand and it's Quicken what we
[1:35:52] believe yes what is part of our
[1:35:56] life that's not in the
[1:36:00] Bible it is the
[1:36:04] Bible it is the
[1:36:06] Bible you're the reason it was written
[1:36:10] and God saw you today whatever scripture
[1:36:11] you need today tomorrow the next day he
[1:36:14] put it in there before the foundation
[1:36:15] work CU he looked down through time and
[1:36:17] said
[1:36:18] hey oh brother D's going to have a
[1:36:20] question about this I'm going to give
[1:36:22] him a scripture and it'll come to his
[1:36:24] mind did that ever happen to you
[1:36:26] happened to me a little bit more than it
[1:36:28] we've done it'll be a new ministry look
[1:36:31] this ministry will never cease this
[1:36:33] ministry will continue on the first will
[1:36:35] continue on it's still just the same God
[1:36:38] gives gifts he don't take them back so
[1:36:40] listen when we come to the place of of
[1:36:42] next Sunday we'll talk about the or the
[1:36:44] next Sunday about the three
[1:36:46] polls it'll be first poll second pull

[1:36:52] foreign to me okay all right you say
[1:36:54] that's foreign to me say just say that's
[1:36:56] foreign to me I don't understand what
[1:36:58] what in the world brother R was talking
[1:36:59] about pulling you know three pulls
[1:37:03] well it was so important that the angel
[1:37:06] told him he said this is that third pull
[1:37:12] amen so if you think it's just words and
[1:37:14] you think it's just something for
[1:37:15] Brother brandham by himself no the angel
[1:37:19] told brother brandham said this is that
[1:37:22] third pull I'll read it to you

[1:37:38] happening this is happening bunch of
[1:37:40] baloney

[1:37:55] got to be what established in the
[1:37:57] present day truth are we established in
[1:38:02] the present day
[1:38:04] truth not Mana from back there it's got
[1:38:08] wiggle
[1:38:09] Tails but fresh
[1:38:11] Mana comes to you and I he went to
[1:38:14] Luther he went to Wesley he had all
[1:38:15] these different um Pentecost and he he
[1:38:19] he told us about justification
[1:38:20] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[1:38:22] first pull second pull third P it all
[1:38:24] comes in you and I have one Jesus had
[1:38:26] one he said Noah had a third P had three
[1:38:27] PS it's a Ministry around the people
[1:38:32] that are there at that time am I clear
[1:38:35] it's a Ministry for the People John
[1:38:38] Wesley did not talk about the third
[1:38:42] pull the Pentecostals never talked about
[1:38:45] the third pull but when brother randam
[1:38:47] comes on the scene the seals get ready
[1:38:49] to open brother brandham says he
[1:38:54] says the first pull was what the first
[1:38:58] pull was the prayer line Second pull was
[1:39:01] discernment third pole was the opening
[1:39:03] of the word we'll read it just a little
[1:39:04] bit later on in a couple weeks but you
[1:39:07] and I are written Epistles so you say
[1:39:11] well where can I find a first pull in
[1:39:13] the Bible where can I find verbatim
[1:39:16] second pull in the Bible Well find me
[1:39:18] verbatim where Abraham's body was
[1:39:21] changed that's right
[1:39:24] right find me where God was going to
[1:39:28] send H H uh William brandham now we know
[1:39:31] he sent Elijah but sent William brandham
[1:39:34] to open the seals it's not in the
[1:39:37] Bible everybody with me but we know it
[1:39:40] is why because it's written in m and
[1:39:43] your heart yes sir it's written in our
[1:39:45] soul it's written where nobody Satan
[1:39:47] can't take that out see Satan can't get
[1:39:49] in that Genesis 126 man he can't be a
[1:39:51] part of it that's right he's out of the
[1:39:55] loop I tell you what when God's standing
[1:39:57] there saying let there be and he starts
[1:39:59] creating all this stuff you know all
[1:40:00] these things and and remember he created
[1:40:03] the devil first right rightand man so
[1:40:06] he's standing right here he ain't off
[1:40:08] you know doing something else he's
[1:40:09] standing right there and he's
[1:40:12] watching he's like
[1:40:14] man let me do that God said no ain't for
[1:40:18] you you stay right there in your place
[1:40:21] and then he starts creating and then he
[1:40:22] says let us make
[1:40:26] man in our own
[1:40:30] image Satan looks
[1:40:33] around he said I don't see
[1:40:35] nobody then all of a sudden brother I'm
[1:40:38] tell us there's a light comes
[1:40:40] out that light comes out and even starts
[1:40:43] saying let there be that light the Lost
[1:40:45] comes out and the devil's going who's
[1:40:49] that and now now God you're talking
[1:40:51] about making somebody in your image
[1:40:53] where they
[1:40:55] at and I'm sure God's just
[1:40:58] smiling cuz he knows the plan Satan
[1:41:00] doesn't know the
[1:41:02] plan but Satan tries to attach himself
[1:41:05] to the plan just like he does
[1:41:08] now but then all of a sudden out of
[1:41:13] that steps
[1:41:17] Michael and Satan's like now come on man
[1:41:21] this is
[1:41:22] confusing you're over there you got this
[1:41:24] you got a light and I feel the I feel
[1:41:27] the power of that guy where'd that guy
[1:41:29] come
[1:41:30] from oh you say you're trinitarian no
[1:41:32] I'm just telling you the forms of God
[1:41:34] that he took that he moved down and to
[1:41:36] get to then all of a
[1:41:38] sudden here's a man stands there that
[1:41:42] says I'm
[1:41:45] lonely
[1:41:50] Adam not in flesh yet uh
[1:41:53] and then he comes down to flesh and he
[1:41:55] says I'm lonely so Satan is watching
[1:41:57] this movement and he's going I couldn't
[1:41:59] see that man before but what's all this
[1:42:02] dust coming together for you ever look
[1:42:04] at it like that cuz you ought to be able
[1:42:05] to if you got sorry I ain't nobody
[1:42:08] special but if you got the mind of God
[1:42:09] and you can see what brother bradam saw
[1:42:11] and then you see what you see in the
[1:42:12] Bible you ought to be able to stand
[1:42:14] there be standing there cuz you
[1:42:16] were amen now I don't believe in this
[1:42:18] garbage that people come shaking hands
[1:42:19] say oh brother we met before the
[1:42:21] foundation of the world no we did not
[1:42:23] that's
[1:42:24] right brother R what were we before we
[1:42:27] were born he said you were nothing only
[1:42:31] in the mind of God now tell me Satan can
[1:42:33] get into the mind of God
[1:42:35] no no way you and I
[1:42:40] can you and I can we have access to it
[1:42:44] we had a prophet say let's go back into
[1:42:45] the back part of God's mind and Satan's
[1:42:48] like and that and and God's like no
[1:42:51] that's not for you he said but that's a
[1:42:53] that's a sinner man he was he was born
[1:42:55] in sin he he denied you he he did this
[1:42:59] and he did that and he almost shot
[1:43:01] himself twice or shot himself one time
[1:43:03] almost committed suicide again he sh
[1:43:05] almost shot them eight boys I mean them
[1:43:07] boys with that gun he did this he did
[1:43:12] that he's My
[1:43:16] Chosen he's the one I'm working with
[1:43:19] now you can do a lot to him you can take
[1:43:22] his b baby you can take his wife but
[1:43:26] you're not taking
[1:43:27] him cuz he come from my
[1:43:31] mind and you cannot destroy the mind of
[1:43:35] God so today if you're born again you
[1:43:38] have that same mind you're a part of
[1:43:41] that Genesis 126 man that
[1:43:43] today is being made real and Satan
[1:43:47] that's where he cannot get a hold of you
[1:43:51] because you're a child of God
[1:43:54] and he's the devil they don't
[1:43:57] mix but you're either one of the two
[1:44:01] today so it's not
[1:44:03] discernment discernment I find them
[1:44:05] things out but this is not discernment
[1:44:07] I'm searching for a new ministry let me
[1:44:08] read this real quick what discernment
[1:44:10] was what the very secrets of the
[1:44:13] heart right they would walk up brother R
[1:44:16] just like I said he would he said I'm
[1:44:17] contacting their spirit and he said he
[1:44:20] said you got to remember I'm not looking
[1:44:22] at that person
[1:44:24] I just read it the other day when he I
[1:44:26] can't remember the book I was reading
[1:44:27] but he said I'm not looking at that
[1:44:29] person cuz he's telling people to be
[1:44:31] still don't move he actually in wherever
[1:44:34] he was at he was in somewhere in
[1:44:35] Arkansas he had to stop the prayer line
[1:44:38] he said I told y'all not to move he said
[1:44:40] God has left the place because people
[1:44:43] was you know running around doing stuff
[1:44:45] moving he said don't
[1:44:47] move he said I'm not looking at that
[1:44:49] person he said I'm looking at their
[1:44:51] life he said said I'm way back in their
[1:44:54] life somewhere I'm not looking at that
[1:44:55] person right now that's right now listen
[1:44:59] I don't want
[1:45:01] that but you have a degree of it
[1:45:04] already amen I really don't want to know
[1:45:07] what y'all thinking right
[1:45:10] now but God does he knows the very
[1:45:14] secrets of your heart absolutely am he
[1:45:16] knows what your heart's thinking listen
[1:45:17] he knows what your heart is feeding
[1:45:21] on Hebrews 4:12
[1:45:24] for the word of God is quick powerful
[1:45:27] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:45:31] piercing even to the dividing now what
[1:45:33] the word of God so if the word's been
[1:45:35] brought pure and
[1:45:37] unadulterated by the prophet to us all
[1:45:40] right written in our
[1:45:42] heart then it's a two-edged sword
[1:45:45] piering even to the dividing a Sund of
[1:45:46] Soul and Spirit and Joint marrow and is
[1:45:48] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:45:52] of of the
[1:45:53] heart brother bery was here a couple
[1:45:56] weeks
[1:45:58] ago and he didn't know anything that
[1:46:00] certain people were going
[1:46:02] through but he absolutely give them
[1:46:05] scripture told them what was going on
[1:46:07] but he never called a name and he didn't
[1:46:09] know who it was but they knew who it was
[1:46:11] amen they knew what they were going
[1:46:13] through and God sent to me see to me
[1:46:16] that's that's God moving in a church not
[1:46:18] that we had a pillar of fire come
[1:46:21] down right not that we shouted and spok
[1:46:23] in tongues run up down the aisle but God
[1:46:26] sent a person here from South Carolina
[1:46:28] that didn't know any of those people
[1:46:29] that were having that very issue he was
[1:46:32] talking about and he comes right here
[1:46:33] and steps right here and anointing
[1:46:35] strikes him he preaches it I don't know
[1:46:37] if he's in his notes or
[1:46:38] not but he answered the question they
[1:46:41] had that's God to me that's a gift that
[1:46:44] de the devil can't get a hold of that
[1:46:46] God has sent to a group of people not
[1:46:48] just us group of people but the whole
[1:46:50] bride around the world he's speaking
[1:46:52] through us
[1:46:53] all the time because he has no other
[1:46:55] voice but mine and your voice brother
[1:46:57] Bram said remember he has no other hands
[1:46:59] but your hands he has no other feet but
[1:47:01] your feet he has no other eyes but your
[1:47:07] eyes so remember that brother Ram had
[1:47:10] the dream or the brothers had the dream
[1:47:14] and then you had the pyramid with the
[1:47:16] things on the outside then he ripped the
[1:47:18] top off and I've read this and I'll read
[1:47:20] it maybe again later on but remember
[1:47:22] what happened he said stay
[1:47:24] here I'll read let's get down a little
[1:47:26] quick and I'll close right here he
[1:47:31] said went West returned back with the
[1:47:35] Holy
[1:47:36] Spirit interpreting this Unwritten
[1:47:40] word which was what when that pyramid
[1:47:43] came off brother brandham had preached
[1:47:45] up to the faith of the fathers he
[1:47:47] preached it right back to right
[1:47:51] here right and then the Holy Spirit
[1:47:54] anointed him to continue on to take the
[1:47:58] unwritten part that nobody could read
[1:48:00] didn't even see it
[1:48:03] remember he interpreted an Unwritten
[1:48:07] Unwritten
[1:48:08] word right or he's a false prophet man I
[1:48:13] can't believe brother Aaron I was
[1:48:14] looking the other day I thought all
[1:48:15] these things that brother Ram did that
[1:48:16] was in continuity with God and they call
[1:48:18] him a false prophet they call him a liar
[1:48:20] because he lied about the you know where
[1:48:23] he was at and he lied about this Lord
[1:48:26] help all these other things all the the
[1:48:30] prayer lines and all these things that
[1:48:32] he said that came to
[1:48:36] pass no they're
[1:48:40] deceived if you're part of that Genesis
[1:48:42] 126 man you will not deny this Bible you
[1:48:46] will not deny the prophet's message
[1:48:49] because it's the very fiber of what you
[1:48:51] live that's why you come to church here
[1:48:53] not over there not here I'm talking
[1:48:55] about in Lula that's why you come to the
[1:48:58] message of the hour cuz there's
[1:48:59] something inside of you that's
[1:49:01] different there's something that Rings a
[1:49:04] little bit
[1:49:05] different right so we got first pull
[1:49:08] second pull third poll first PLL was
[1:49:09] what it was healing second PLL was
[1:49:14] prophesying now we'll get into that and
[1:49:16] the third poll is the opening of the
[1:49:18] word he said the Mysteries revealed and
[1:49:21] that's in the an O once at the end time
[1:49:23] the very day when this messenger not
[1:49:25] when he starts but when he begins to
[1:49:26] declare his message see the very day
[1:49:28] when not when he starts he started by
[1:49:31] reading the outside of the pyramid
[1:49:33] because this is the faith of the fathers
[1:49:35] it's all this right here it's the faith
[1:49:37] of the fathers this is the seals right
[1:49:41] this is Christ The Mystery of God
[1:49:42] revealed this is revealing anointed ones
[1:49:45] at the end time the grace of marriage
[1:49:47] and divorce all the different things
[1:49:48] that he preached after the seals were
[1:49:50] open amen that's right am so he told
[1:49:53] them he said hey stop and look on
[1:49:56] that he went and got the unwritten
[1:50:01] part got to
[1:50:04] Arizona the angel said go back to
[1:50:07] Jeffersonville he said the pope be told
[1:50:09] you there and everything that brother
[1:50:11] brandom said now I want you to listen to
[1:50:13] me cuz I'm going to read them we're
[1:50:14] going to get in a seal book I'm going to
[1:50:15] read to you first seal he said I'd have
[1:50:18] made he looking over my old notes he
[1:50:19] said I'd have made a horrible
[1:50:21] mistake if I have said what I said off
[1:50:24] my old notes now I'm telling you he told
[1:50:27] us this that's right it's not here say
[1:50:30] on
[1:50:32] tap he said I made a horrible mistake
[1:50:34] cuz in 1957 1959 he preached Mighty
[1:50:37] conqueror and he preached that as the
[1:50:38] Holy
[1:50:39] Ghost Cupid shooting arrows of love and
[1:50:42] they didn't have arrows it's a bow with
[1:50:45] no arrows it's a it's a
[1:50:47] bluff second seal he said I thought
[1:50:52] something something
[1:50:53] different third seal fifth seal he
[1:50:56] thought that
[1:50:58] was
[1:51:00] Saints now didn't come on that's what he
[1:51:04] said he said it this Ain here say he
[1:51:06] said it on
[1:51:08] tape he said this is
[1:51:11] beyond what I have seen oh what a
[1:51:14] prophet amen I'm glad we had a prophet
[1:51:17] that told us all of his faults and all
[1:51:19] his failures and how many times he tried
[1:51:20] to kill himself and how many times he
[1:51:22] did this how many times he didn't do
[1:51:23] what God Said praise God for a man that
[1:51:25] could tell us that and still be a
[1:51:27] prophet of God still be somebody that
[1:51:30] God used God didn't quit using him when
[1:51:32] he tried to kill himself right that's
[1:51:36] just part of his human Journey
[1:51:39] right and if he hadn't God hadn't to
[1:51:41] shut them bullets off he'd he would have
[1:51:44] been a murderer right he was going to
[1:51:46] shoot them eight kids or whatever how
[1:51:48] many kids that was he going to shoot
[1:51:49] them he said I emptied my gun and none
[1:51:52] of went off he said but I went somewhere
[1:51:54] else load him back up pow pow pow pow
[1:51:56] pow so you tell me who that was that was
[1:51:59] God that was God protecting a gift right
[1:52:02] that you and I could get it today and
[1:52:05] not be stuck in a prison somewhere for
[1:52:07] being a murderer or taking his own
[1:52:11] life people hate for you to talk about
[1:52:13] that they hate hate for you to say
[1:52:14] anything about that but I just I just
[1:52:17] love it that he told it I don't care
[1:52:19] about all this garbage that people said
[1:52:21] he did and this and that he set on tape
[1:52:23] he said say what did the brother R say
[1:52:25] he said say what set on
[1:52:27] tape right you won't go wrong if you'll
[1:52:30] say what set on tape well I'm going to
[1:52:31] tell you he said he was going to reach
[1:52:33] and grab that
[1:52:35] wire and take his life he said the next
[1:52:38] thing I know I was down at the bottom of
[1:52:39] the
[1:52:40] pole took the gun
[1:52:43] out going to shoot them
[1:52:46] kids remember he did get in several
[1:52:49] fights of course he was a boxer but
[1:52:51] remember when his told him to tie the
[1:52:53] string on his finger and count every how
[1:52:55] many times he said remember what he did
[1:52:57] he said I th throw that thing down and I
[1:52:58] went at

[2:07:54] oh I was going to say Brother Anderson
[2:07:55] he's sitting he's standing right
[2:07:57] here you're a long way off for I
[2:08:00] received of the Lord that which also I
[2:08:02] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[2:08:03] the same night in which he was betrayed
[2:08:05] took bread and when he had given thanks
[2:08:07] he break it and said take eat this is my
[2:08:09] body which is broken for you this do in
[2:08:12] remembrance of me after the same manner
[2:08:15] also he took the cup and when he had St
[2:08:17] saying this cup is a new testament in my
[2:08:19] blood this do you as often as you drink
[2:08:21] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[2:08:23] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[2:08:25] you do show the Lord's death till he
[2:08:27] come today should be a dying out we
[2:08:30] should get rid of the things that we've
[2:08:32] that we've held on to for even for a
[2:08:34] month yeah you can yeah even
[2:08:37] Christians we can feel we can feel like
[2:08:40] we've got a burden on
[2:08:42] us but this communion is not going to do
[2:08:44] it physically that Wine's not going to
[2:08:46] do it or bread but the the what the
[2:08:49] representation
[2:08:52] that he died to release you from all
[2:08:54] that he said lay your burdens on
[2:08:58] me lay them on
[2:09:00] him sometimes we fight we fight too much
[2:09:04] let God fight for
[2:09:06] us we try to fight we try to make our
[2:09:09] you know this is way our kids should be
[2:09:10] or this is way my husband or my wife
[2:09:12] should be and all this turn over to
[2:09:15] God right my Mama Tried to save me for
[2:09:17] 20 something
[2:09:18] years and and bless bless bless her
[2:09:20] heart her prayers
[2:09:22] did but not just because she's who she
[2:09:25] is Dad either the real Daddy's the one
[2:09:29] that showed up when the real daddy
[2:09:30] showed up that day then I know I didn't
[2:09:33] have
[2:09:34] to yeah Daddy could my my physical daddy
[2:09:38] could be somewhere else but that Daddy
[2:09:39] stays with you all the time wherefore
[2:09:42] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[2:09:43] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[2:09:45] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[2:09:47] but let a man examine himself examine
[2:09:49] yourself today and so let him eat of
[2:09:51] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[2:09:53] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[2:09:54] eateth drinketh Damnation to himself not
[2:09:57] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[2:09:59] caused many are weak and sickly among
[2:10:00] you and many
[2:10:01] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:10:04] should not be judged but when we are
[2:10:05] judged we are chasen of the Lord that we
[2:10:08] should not be condemned with the world
[2:10:11] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:10:12] together to eat tarry one for another If
[2:10:15] any man hunger late him meet at home
[2:10:17] that you come not together into
[2:10:18] condemnation and Paul tells them the
[2:10:20] rest he'll sh said in order when he gets
[2:10:22] there in other words he goes and visits
[2:10:23] the Corinthians again and he tells them
[2:10:25] about certain other things he wasn't
[2:10:27] finished he was just getting started
[2:10:28] with them but that one point God gave to
[2:10:31] Paul to give to us and he wasn't even a
[2:10:33] witness that's how God works he wasn't
[2:10:36] even
[2:10:37] there amen and he told it so vividly
[2:10:41] that none of the other
[2:10:42] ones uh what you say in in the old term
[2:10:45] bucked him about it you know what do you
[2:10:47] mean you giving this to the Corinthians
[2:10:49] and and you want even
[2:10:52] there Peter said Paul says some things
[2:10:54] hard to be understood that's kind of
[2:10:56] what he said he said so just leave it
[2:10:58] alone CU God give it to him and revealed
[2:11:00] it to him and we take
[2:11:02] it and we take it according to what Paul

[2:18:04] take thank you
[2:18:10] Lord the Bible tells us that after
[2:18:13] supper was
[2:18:17] ended Jesus after and supper being ended
[2:18:21] the devil having now put in the heart of
[2:18:22] Judas that's carat Simon son to betray
[2:18:24] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[2:18:27] given all things into his hand and he
[2:18:28] come from God and he went to God he
[2:18:31] rised from supper and laid aside His
[2:18:33] Garment and took a towel and GED himself
[2:18:36] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:18:37] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:18:39] to wipe them with the towel where with
[2:18:41] he was
[2:18:42] girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[2:18:45] Peter said unto him Lord do thou wash my
[2:18:47] feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:18:49] what I do thou knowest not now but Thou
[2:18:51] shalt know Hereafter I'm sure after the
[2:18:53] day of Pentecost he knew exactly what
[2:18:54] was going on Peter saith unto him Thou
[2:18:57] shalt never wash my feet don't ever tell
[2:18:59] Jesus
[2:19:00] never don't
