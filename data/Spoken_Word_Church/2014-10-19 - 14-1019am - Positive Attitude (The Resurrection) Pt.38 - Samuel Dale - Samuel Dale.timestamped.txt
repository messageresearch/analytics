[25:05] amen
[25:06] Penny and
[25:09] Brenda are not here today too so Ronald
[25:12] is some missing all right
[25:15] Philippians 3.
[25:18] we'll start reading about verse seven we
[25:20] can read a lot of the others but
[25:23] to get a point but what things were
[25:26] gained to me
[25:28] those I counted lost for Christ
[25:31] yea doubtless and I count all things but
[25:34] lost for the Excellency of the knowledge
[25:37] of Christ Jesus my Lord
[25:40] for whom I am
[25:43] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[25:46] things and do count them but done that I
[25:49] may win Christ and be found in him not
[25:52] having mine own righteousness which is
[25:55] of the law but that which is through the
[25:58] Faith of Christ and then righteousness
[26:00] which is of god by faith
[26:05] that I may know him
[26:07] and the power of his resurrection
[26:10] The Fellowship of his suffering
[26:12] being made conformable unto his death
[26:15] if by any means I might attain unto the
[26:20] resurrection
[26:21] of the Dead not as though I had already
[26:24] obtained either was already perfect but
[26:27] I follow after if that I may appreh may
[26:31] app excuse me if that I may apprehend
[26:34] that which also I am apprehended of
[26:37] Christ then he goes on counting it all
[26:40] lost but he pressed toward the mark of
[26:42] the prize you may be seated the Lord had
[26:44] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[26:46] now we've got a
[26:49] I know there's two or three up here now
[26:52] of these new you know the things the uh
[26:55] come
[26:56] companion and there's three I think
[26:59] laying up here it might be one more
[27:00] downstairs I know there's like three up
[27:03] here
[27:04] um
[27:05] so you know get them and read them and
[27:07] listen to the tape and things and then
[27:09] you know bring them back to where we can
[27:12] pass them about Among Us
[27:15] remember me tomorrow to about one
[27:18] o'clock I've got to go for a stress test
[27:20] well I'm not worried about this test
[27:23] with the stress
[27:25] because I've never been on one of those
[27:26] things and the way my lag is right now I
[27:29] might get about halfway through and have
[27:31] to call a halt and tell them I'll peg
[27:33] leg on the other one or something but
[27:36] you know just keep us in your prayers
[27:38] everything's all right no problem
[27:39] there's something routine all right but
[27:43] now
[27:44] I want us to think on something
[27:49] it's odd the way Paul says it there
[27:53] in verse 11.
[27:55] if by any means I might attain unto the
[28:00] resurrection
[28:01] of the Dead
[28:03] now that's a that's an odd statement
[28:06] it's an odd way of stating it especially
[28:08] where he's talking about
[28:11] now what does he mean
[28:17] so he goes on making it look like that
[28:20] he's done he said but uh I
[28:25] it looks like he's saying I haven't
[28:27] apprehended these things or come to
[28:29] these things
[28:31] all right but why would he say that
[28:34] you know
[28:36] when we know that he
[28:40] was a born-again Christian
[28:42] right
[28:43] all right we know that he was a prophet
[28:47] of God for the time and you know Church
[28:50] age messenger
[28:52] and why would he be talking like
[28:55] seemingly the it sounds like if you just
[28:58] read that without understanding that
[29:01] he's
[29:02] saying well you know I don't know
[29:04] whether I'm born again or not
[29:06] because I haven't fully apprehended
[29:09] these things you know I haven't reached
[29:12] a goal I haven't done these things
[29:14] but what is he really saying we know
[29:17] that he's not
[29:18] confused
[29:20] we know if anything we're the ones
[29:22] confused
[29:23] all right so now what is he saying
[29:27] to bring that out
[29:31] let's just read what the prophet has to
[29:32] say and let him answer this and then we
[29:36] can move on into the point that I want
[29:38] you to get go ahead and pull up number
[29:40] one which is the uh sardisian Church age
[29:43] which is church age book uh page 277.
[29:49] now he's coming down and explaining
[29:51] about the names and the things up above
[29:55] but then he gives that scripture
[30:00] you know of saying if by any means I
[30:02] might attain to the resurrection of the
[30:04] Dead
[30:05] now this statement is most peculiar
[30:08] we all know that we're are all going to
[30:11] be in a resurrection whether we want to
[30:14] be or not
[30:15] all will be Resurrected so Paul could
[30:18] hardly be saying if by any means I might
[30:22] attain to a resurrection of the Dead see
[30:25] because all they did will be ready
[30:26] regardless good bad or whatever
[30:28] everybody's going to be raised
[30:31] he said the truth of the matter is he is
[30:34] not saying that
[30:35] the literal reading is if by any means I
[30:39] might attain to the out Resurrection
[30:44] from among the Dead
[30:46] all right
[30:48] this is not the attaining to the general
[30:51] or second Resurrection
[30:54] but attaining to the first resurrection
[30:57] no
[31:01] look what he's saying
[31:03] of which he said blessed his own is he
[31:05] that part in the first resurrection of
[31:07] which the second death hath no part all
[31:09] right the literal
[31:12] reading there
[31:13] the original says
[31:16] I may attain to the resurrection out of
[31:19] the Dead ones
[31:22] that's your original translation
[31:25] Williams says it like this the
[31:27] resurrection
[31:28] from among the Dead
[31:31] huh
[31:32] uh rockerman I'm just giving you these
[31:34] from different translations
[31:36] to the earlier Resurrection
[31:40] which is from among the Dead
[31:42] now I spoke on this
[31:44] back before but
[31:46] you know years ago I remember it
[31:50] but I want you to think about it
[31:52] the prophet says
[31:54] that this is not the general
[31:56] Resurrection
[31:58] but it has to do with the first
[31:59] resurrection
[32:03] and having to do with the first
[32:05] resurrection
[32:07] we know that he was a born-again
[32:09] believer
[32:11] that is the first resurrection right
[32:15] over which the second death had no part
[32:18] the first resurrection throughout the
[32:19] Bible is speaking of the Resurrection
[32:23] you know from us
[32:26] from Sinners to Christians that's the
[32:29] first resurrection the new birth
[32:31] all right over which the second death
[32:34] can't have any doing but why would Paul
[32:36] talk about an out Resurrection
[32:40] you know
[32:41] out from among the Dead
[32:45] all right
[32:47] when we know as I said I keep repeating
[32:49] that where you'll won't miss it
[32:52] we believe he was a born-again believer
[32:56] we believe that he at the new birth
[32:59] we believe the new birth is the first
[33:01] resurrection
[33:03] all right now that's not talking about
[33:05] physical Resurrection
[33:07] that's talking about the spiritual
[33:09] Resurrection
[33:11] all right the new birth
[33:14] all right now
[33:16] you remember how we were bringing out
[33:17] that what death was
[33:21] the death being unbelief
[33:24] right
[33:26] what's killing us unbelief
[33:29] well bless God brother Dale I don't have
[33:30] no unbelief well
[33:33] all right just
[33:35] keep praying for us
[33:36] here's a man that we would put him at a
[33:40] high Apex of understanding and put him
[33:43] in a place that we would all love to
[33:46] walk
[33:47] in the position that he walked with
[33:49] Jesus Christ and the the word that he
[33:53] walked in
[33:54] but yet he seems to
[33:57] wonder about something
[34:00] you know in the writing it seems like
[34:02] that he's
[34:04] he's talking about but but you know I
[34:07] haven't obtained to this
[34:10] well what is he saying
[34:12] what would that have the relationship to
[34:14] you and I
[34:16] because now I'm going to make the
[34:17] statement and then we'll move on see
[34:19] each and every one of us is standing in
[34:21] this same place
[34:25] no brother Dale I'm born again and I
[34:28] don't have to worry about a resurrection
[34:29] no we know that that's all right that's
[34:31] good
[34:34] but you see let me speak with Paul
[34:38] let me say what he's saying right
[34:41] for myself
[34:44] that Lord
[34:45] I know I've not finished the course
[34:49] I know the race is not over
[34:51] you know and I know that there's
[34:54] problems and troubles
[34:57] but Lord
[34:59] just help me
[35:01] I believe I'm a born-again Believer
[35:04] I believe I have the first resurrection
[35:06] inside of me
[35:08] which is a new birth
[35:11] and Lord help me to be raised out from
[35:14] among the Dead
[35:17] all right
[35:19] now I believe that points to this end
[35:21] time more than anything
[35:24] right you know I believe the situation
[35:26] points down to here because this is
[35:29] where the major thing remember what we
[35:30] were talking about that that
[35:33] the eagle was the one that called it
[35:36] death
[35:37] he was the only one that would bring it
[35:39] up and it would force you know come up
[35:41] under the fourth combat beast and and
[35:44] coming up to the four seal and and
[35:46] things and being the name of death
[35:52] I believe others understood that don't
[35:54] you
[35:55] I believe Paul understood death don't
[35:57] you
[35:58] but yet it was not brought out to call
[36:01] it that
[36:03] give it a name
[36:05] until the end time
[36:07] because it would be in the end time that
[36:09] we would really find out what death is
[36:13] right as I say then death is not dying
[36:16] quit your heart quit beating you go down
[36:18] to the Undertaker you know
[36:21] because that's not the end of the person
[36:25] because the soul lives on somewhere
[36:27] whether you're a Christian or a sinner
[36:31] it'll go on to a time and have to be a
[36:35] resurrection and a general and come
[36:37] forth and you know
[36:40] all right but why would Paul talk about
[36:42] an out Resurrection
[36:46] and like I said if if he talks about it
[36:49] back there
[36:51] that he'd want to be you know an out
[36:54] Resurrection from among the Dead
[36:57] how much more should you and I or how
[36:59] much more would it pertain to this day
[37:03] when everything is really coming to an
[37:05] end and getting in horrible shape all
[37:09] right let's read another statement and
[37:11] then get back to our thought look at
[37:14] number two which is page 356 of the lady
[37:17] will see in church age Church age book
[37:20] let me say this here
[37:22] I don't mean that God is calling only to
[37:25] the false finder repent in this verse
[37:27] he's talking to the elect
[37:29] we have some repenting to do
[37:32] many of his children in these false
[37:35] churches are still in these false
[37:37] churches
[37:38] there are those of whom it speaks in
[37:40] Ephesians 5 14. awake thou that
[37:44] Sleepless and arise from the dead and
[37:47] Christ shall give thee light
[37:50] now
[37:51] Ephesians is writing to Christians
[37:56] awake thou that Sleepless
[37:59] all right
[38:01] but they're born again Christians
[38:06] all right read what he's saying there
[38:08] are those of whom he speaks of in
[38:10] Ephesians 5 14. await thou that sleep us
[38:13] and arise from the dead and Christ shall
[38:15] give thee light
[38:16] to be asleep is not to be dead
[38:19] these are sleeping amongst the Dead
[38:24] now remember the other quote
[38:27] to be brought from out from among the
[38:29] Dead
[38:32] all right
[38:34] these are sleeping amongst the dead they
[38:37] were out there in the dead denominations
[38:40] they're floating along with them God
[38:43] Cries Out wake up repent of your folly
[38:46] here they are lending their influence
[38:50] given their time and their money
[38:53] actually they're very lives to these
[38:55] Antichrist organizations
[38:58] and all the while thinking it is all
[39:00] right
[39:01] they need to repent they must repent
[39:03] they need to have a change of mind
[39:07] and turn toward truth
[39:10] now when we
[39:13] when I left the Baptist Church
[39:15] I didn't require that my wife leave with
[39:18] me I gave her a choice
[39:21] and at that point I told her I said I
[39:24] will give you money to go to the church
[39:27] you know gas money
[39:29] I'll assure you a way of getting there
[39:30] if you don't want to go with me
[39:33] I told her the same thing when we were
[39:35] at a church first one in this message
[39:38] and I said now if you want to continue
[39:40] there I will
[39:43] Supply you with gas you know your food
[39:46] your whatever you do that way but I said
[39:48] I will not give you any money to put in
[39:51] the offering plate of the church
[39:55] I saw that then that
[39:57] I had put my money in all of the years
[39:59] through the organizational system and
[40:02] even knew that in the Baptist Church
[40:04] back in the in the 50s when I was Dire
[40:07] and on up up 60 that you know that we
[40:10] were sending money to incite rights in
[40:13] foreign countries
[40:16] you say don't people don't do it no it's
[40:19] just sending over there to try to get
[40:22] things started they don't offend it over
[40:23] there to buy guns and do no it's to try
[40:27] to get everything to go and
[40:29] and
[40:30] you know but we think about
[40:34] do you realize that
[40:36] if it's not the truth
[40:39] and we've just read it
[40:41] and we're supporting that with our
[40:43] presence and our uh money
[40:47] we're part of that
[40:50] right all right
[40:52] so then he says await thou that sleepeth
[40:57] he said the people are asleep out there
[41:00] among the denominations
[41:02] well now
[41:04] I don't think denominationalism ended
[41:07] when the prophet came on the scene I
[41:09] think it really came into being
[41:11] as death
[41:13] from his understanding
[41:15] all right and that's why I'm so strong
[41:18] against
[41:20] um doctrinal issues that come up
[41:23] and I want you to understand you know
[41:25] but yet still I do not make you listen
[41:29] to only what is
[41:30] said here
[41:32] but I've always made the one statement
[41:35] as the pastor of the group
[41:38] I feel the the obligation to if I see a
[41:42] Doctrine coming in I'll say something
[41:44] about it
[41:46] why because if it is a Doctrine
[41:52] and it's a wrong Doctrine then it's
[41:54] death
[41:56] that's what I were hoping you would
[41:57] catching on to what I I've been
[41:59] preaching about what death really is
[42:01] death is really the carnality of our
[42:03] mind because that's what's killing us
[42:05] what did Prophet The Prophet say he said
[42:08] unbelief killed Eve
[42:13] that was death to her unbelief
[42:16] all right
[42:17] see then you know
[42:19] I'm trying to put these two together for
[42:22] you to think about something
[42:25] these that he said awake thou that
[42:27] sleepeth he called them bride
[42:30] right
[42:30] chosen people all right
[42:33] he speaks of an out Resurrection
[42:37] from among the Dead
[42:40] and yet we know that he had that
[42:43] Resurrection inside of him
[42:47] right
[42:49] man these that it says awake
[42:51] thou that Sleepless
[42:53] the prophet said to be asleep is not to
[42:55] be dead
[42:57] all right awake now that's sleeping
[43:00] all right you mean it's possible to to
[43:02] do yeah if possible to be sitting
[43:07] in a sleep not physically you know
[43:12] sitting and listening to
[43:14] doctrines and things
[43:16] and
[43:19] be asleep
[43:23] you notice a lot of times I've I've
[43:25] noticed this thing in my life
[43:29] when you try to correct a Doctrine
[43:32] the people automatically defend the one
[43:35] who brought the doctrine
[43:37] you don't understand
[43:40] you don't know what they're talking
[43:41] about you you don't understand you don't
[43:45] well
[43:49] do I need to understand
[43:52] or do I need to just wake up
[43:56] yeah
[43:57] yeah
[43:59] now
[44:00] what I'm getting at if debt is unbelief
[44:10] if death is unbelief
[44:12] then unbelief In You and I
[44:17] his death to you and I as much as it
[44:19] would be to
[44:23] a person has never even born again or
[44:25] anything
[44:27] see that's what's putting us in the
[44:28] grave
[44:31] right
[44:34] now I tried to explain to you the point
[44:38] I was getting at that see sometimes lack
[44:41] of information brings us to unbelief
[44:45] right you know lack of information in
[44:48] other words not having the ability uh
[44:51] when we went over to
[44:53] um
[44:54] the Philippines especially I remember
[44:56] them talking about that you know that a
[44:59] lot of Doctrine especially the two souls
[45:01] and things was really prevalent over
[45:03] there
[45:04] and they said we had nothing to be able
[45:06] to quote back with them so they would
[45:08] come with quotes from Brother random and
[45:10] said we had nothing
[45:11] said we were at the mercy
[45:14] of those who were coming our way
[45:17] but he said you know the people they
[45:19] said but God opened up the gate to where
[45:22] that we could get the message
[45:24] and see then they turned against the
[45:26] doctrines
[45:27] well all right now
[45:31] that I believe is what the prophet is
[45:33] trying to explain about
[45:36] us that we can be asleep
[45:40] you say to a lot of people you tell them
[45:42] well brother so-and-so's teeth he don't
[45:44] teach that
[45:47] why I've never heard him say that
[45:53] well how many times you need to go back
[45:57] and play the last day that I was sitting
[45:59] there listening and they said this right
[46:02] here
[46:03] well I didn't hear it
[46:05] I guess they mean it didn't happen
[46:07] you know something like that because
[46:10] you know
[46:11] but understand what I'm getting at
[46:14] to be asleep
[46:18] even in Lula
[46:22] okay in Lula
[46:25] you can be sitting right here and saying
[46:28] you believe the word and as far as
[46:30] what's being preached you can be sound
[46:32] of sleep
[46:33] and not have understanding of what
[46:35] that's being said
[46:37] I realize that that's why I repeat
[46:39] myself continually
[46:41] to at least to one point that you can
[46:44] have an opportunity to
[46:47] to check it out or to understand I keep
[46:50] repeating to where you'll know what I
[46:53] believe
[46:55] that's to the point
[46:58] would you say well brother Dale you know
[47:00] I believe everything you say
[47:03] well
[47:09] I think we need to wake up in Lula
[47:12] that's the main thing
[47:14] because if we don't wake up see then
[47:18] we'll go right on sleeping thinking
[47:20] we're right in the word
[47:25] now if you understand that point I
[47:28] believe that's what Paul was talking
[47:29] about
[47:32] when he said I want to attain and
[47:34] brother Branham used it see to an out
[47:36] Resurrection because that's the regional
[47:38] translation
[47:39] an out-resurrection
[47:43] from among the Dead
[47:45] all right
[47:47] there were already people back in Paul's
[47:49] time that were
[47:50] perverting the truth
[47:53] you've even got like I think his
[47:55] villages and how many years before I put
[47:56] the wrong words are you doing teaching
[47:58] the resurrection was already passed you
[48:01] know what they were getting at from what
[48:03] Paul said
[48:05] but it was their perversion from what
[48:08] they thought Paul was saying amen
[48:11] because Paul as I said
[48:13] he's talking about a resurrection here
[48:15] you read his writings he speaks
[48:19] emphatically of a resurrection
[48:22] because the day you're born again you're
[48:25] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[48:27] in Christ Jesus
[48:31] well those two preachers just got the
[48:32] wrong idea what he's talking about
[48:36] it's like the people in the days of
[48:37] Martin Luther
[48:39] when Martin Luther protests the Catholic
[48:41] Church and said get away from them
[48:43] systems that's death
[48:45] we know what a lot of them start doing
[48:47] we're not burning the buildings
[48:50] I thought that's what Luther was talking
[48:53] about he said no I'm not talking about
[48:55] that
[48:56] I'm talking about wake up
[48:59] to the truth of the hour
[49:02] I've got a little message you want to
[49:04] follow this in a week or so about a
[49:07] Revival
[49:09] you know I believe we need a Revival
[49:12] all right
[49:15] he said well the world no no no see
[49:17] there you go all of that
[49:21] not a worldwide sweeping Revival there
[49:23] won't be another one the next one is
[49:25] through the two witnesses and that won't
[49:26] be a worldwide one that'll only be
[49:29] through Israel at the time
[49:31] right
[49:32] right all right
[49:34] but why can't the bride have a Revival
[49:39] I think of anything the people of this
[49:41] message need to be revived more than
[49:42] anything
[49:47] but see I believe that's what Paul is
[49:49] talking about he's not talking about a a
[49:52] resurrection of doing this not the other
[49:54] he's talking about this first
[49:56] resurrection that is inside of me
[50:01] I want to stay with that
[50:05] until I can fully Attain
[50:09] that's right are you with me
[50:11] I want to stay with this truth until I
[50:14] can fully Attain
[50:16] to an out Resurrection
[50:21] well you know what
[50:23] it was not in that age in that time
[50:27] for that to be fully made manifest right
[50:31] amen it would be down here in the end
[50:33] where we're at
[50:35] right
[50:37] see then and out Resurrection
[50:41] but like I say
[50:43] you go out and tell people
[50:45] who's right and who's wrong
[50:47] well you don't understand that brother
[50:54] I never heard him say that
[50:58] you know
[51:00] you're just talking about something you
[51:02] don't know
[51:04] I've been there for 30 years and ain't
[51:06] never heard that
[51:10] I only heard the truth preached
[51:16] well
[51:18] may I uh
[51:23] remind some of you
[51:25] that you did come from some of these
[51:27] places that you finally woke up
[51:33] right
[51:34] you finally woke up
[51:37] and realized that you were sitting there
[51:38] asleep
[51:45] to the people of this message the
[51:46] biggest portion of the people are asleep
[51:50] woe unto them that are at ease in Zion
[51:55] well because they're not concerned with
[51:56] any truth
[51:58] I don't want to hear it anymore I might
[52:00] get confused
[52:04] you mean you don't want to hear truth
[52:07] you know what your trouble is you might
[52:09] find out you're confused
[52:11] it might require that we wake up
[52:15] I am talking to Lula I'm not preaching
[52:17] I'm tired anybody out there is listening
[52:19] to their own account
[52:21] I'm talking to this church
[52:26] I've watched you for
[52:28] 40 years
[52:30] and see a lot of you just going to sleep
[52:35] you know just relax and just
[52:39] not that great desire and Zeal that you
[52:41] had 20 years ago
[52:48] but see you going to sleep
[52:52] just
[52:54] but see I want to be a part of an out
[52:56] Resurrection
[52:58] because now I'm going to tell you what I
[53:00] believe
[53:01] I believe the only way they can become a
[53:03] physical Resurrection
[53:05] because that's the next thing in order
[53:07] right
[53:08] is the dead in Christ shall rise first
[53:11] don't worry about the Rapture don't
[53:14] worry about the change don't worry about
[53:15] to being caught away be concerned with
[53:18] the right of the Resurrection because
[53:20] according to my Bible and the prophet we
[53:23] talk about the resurrection of the Dead
[53:26] comes first
[53:28] all right
[53:29] so if the resurrection of the Dead comes
[53:31] first Paul's right
[53:36] you know I've heard people make remarks
[53:38] and I don't like to make remarks about
[53:40] it but I've heard them say you know well
[53:42] in the name of church you know like and
[53:43] said
[53:44] the Bible says the dead in Christ shall
[53:46] rise first and said there ain't nothing
[53:48] no deader than that church
[53:50] you know and I don't like those remarks
[53:52] because that's
[53:54] I'm talking here
[53:56] all right
[53:57] an out Resurrection
[54:02] now Paul if you were living in our day
[54:07] what would you be thinking about
[54:12] I believe he'd say
[54:14] I would be thinking about the message
[54:15] that you hear
[54:17] you know from the prophet
[54:20] it brought us to a truth of what death
[54:22] is and what life is and and and the
[54:25] opening of the word to bring all things
[54:27] into view
[54:31] what are we like I was going down the
[54:33] road one day and was going deer hunting
[54:35] and
[54:36] and uh
[54:37] a couple of
[54:39] good old Baptist methodists in the car
[54:42] they got to arguing over marriage and
[54:44] divorce and
[54:45] one of them said
[54:47] you can't tell me I ain't right
[54:50] I thought you know that's true
[54:58] it's set back there we got down there
[55:00] waiting it was in another vehicle or
[55:02] something I forgot to have somebody come
[55:03] by and said come on I said oh I want to
[55:05] sit here and listen
[55:07] now they got a good thing going I want
[55:09] to hear the rest of you I don't care
[55:11] about hunting
[55:13] but see Church
[55:15] you can't tell somebody
[55:18] that don't want to listen
[55:21] right
[55:23] they don't want to hear you can't tell
[55:24] them
[55:25] all right
[55:27] now
[55:28] so then what do they have to do and I'm
[55:30] not de-christianizing anybody
[55:34] Heaven Help Me
[55:36] to ever de-christianize anybody
[55:40] when I told you 30 40 years ago that the
[55:43] most of the people this message would
[55:44] die and go by the grave before the
[55:45] change I never de-christianized nobody
[55:48] and never have
[55:49] I've never put any of these people of of
[55:52] doctrinal issues and send them to hell
[55:54] because of their issues and their
[55:55] doctrines
[55:57] I just don't agree with the doctrine
[56:00] and I try to warn you and I about the
[56:01] doctrine and the ideas
[56:05] he said well that was just well
[56:07] I wish you would have stood there
[56:09] 30 years ago and told me that
[56:14] and I probably would have questioned you
[56:17] but you can say all today yeah they're
[56:19] dying because they're getting older
[56:21] and 30 40 years ago there's a lot of
[56:23] young people in this message
[56:26] wow
[56:27] but you see Church
[56:29] an out Resurrection
[56:38] see to awake
[56:42] out of sleep
[56:44] and sleep is put there because of a
[56:48] um
[56:49] you know I like to read things and I
[56:51] enjoy doing it
[56:54] you know really why why you sleep
[56:57] you ever thought about it
[56:59] one simple little thing
[57:02] you know why you sleep
[57:05] because you're tired
[57:07] that's simple
[57:09] did that pack a big light bulb sister
[57:11] Regina to turn on
[57:14] oh
[57:16] no we sleep because we are tired
[57:22] and now
[57:24] you can be tired because of lack of
[57:27] malnutrition
[57:32] are you following me you granted that
[57:34] other part now were you on the grand
[57:38] malnutrition is because of lack of
[57:41] vitamins minerals food Etc
[57:46] right
[57:47] your body begins to dehydrate
[57:52] because of lack of fluids
[57:56] you know what you do you sleep a lot
[58:00] right
[58:03] the older you get you'll see you need
[58:05] more sleep but the problem is you sleep
[58:08] and then you wake up the next morning
[58:09] too early
[58:10] you got you have to get out of that part
[58:12] of it but
[58:14] but you're following me now
[58:16] malnutrition is a lack of
[58:20] Foods
[58:24] right
[58:26] when I look around to message people and
[58:31] go there and listen you know it's all I
[58:33] say and
[58:34] they preaching the same message they was
[58:36] preaching 40 years ago women's hiring
[58:39] dress and clothes and things you know
[58:41] and mainly getting on what the world's
[58:43] doing and what's happening here and
[58:45] whatever is being done dire and
[58:46] whatever's being done there and Pope
[58:48] coming out of the United States and you
[58:50] know same old things they were talking
[58:52] about 40 years ago
[58:54] well you know you can die of
[58:56] malnutrition
[58:57] but the first things that comes to you
[59:00] is to go to sleep
[59:02] that's a natural reaction from the body
[59:03] these nurses could tell you you remove
[59:06] the energy from the body and it just it
[59:09] just starts relaxing you know I mean
[59:12] there's no way to pump it up without
[59:14] putting more in
[59:16] so that's why you eat and drink
[59:18] I mean you go down to the doctor and you
[59:20] say doctor I'm feeling real bad well
[59:22] what I want to tell you to do just don't
[59:23] drink nothing for the next two weeks
[59:25] let's see if you still living if you are
[59:26] come by but make sure you pay the bill
[59:30] is that you know yeah yeah no they
[59:33] wouldn't do that away but
[59:35] no because you know that's not the way
[59:39] what you see most of the people of this
[59:40] message are starving to death
[59:42] with the books and the tapes at their
[59:44] possession
[59:46] and claiming to believe everything the
[59:48] prophet said
[59:51] and remember I'm preaching to Lula
[59:54] okay
[59:56] remember in Lula
[59:58] you know
[1:00:00] and how many of you were you used to
[1:00:04] that you would
[1:00:05] read and
[1:00:08] pray and things but you kind of relax
[1:00:13] and you kind of got a little draw for
[1:00:15] that you know
[1:00:17] and your church attendance Falls first
[1:00:19] because you know a car don't quit it
[1:00:23] starts missing
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:26] cutting off get a flutter foot foot and
[1:00:28] then it quits
[1:00:29] and that's the way people are
[1:00:32] they just start dropping off their
[1:00:34] attendance is the first thing
[1:00:37] well now where would you be now you can
[1:00:39] argue if you want to about this that or
[1:00:41] the other but where would you be if you
[1:00:43] come up here
[1:00:45] and I wasn't hearing you know
[1:00:50] well you're not the only one somebody
[1:00:52] preached to us well you'd have to get up
[1:00:54] somebody that day what was it like the
[1:00:56] other day when when we had
[1:00:59] five or six preachers and three deacons
[1:01:01] and there wasn't one in the building
[1:01:03] well who's going to get up
[1:01:06] and do whatever
[1:01:09] I I'm just talking plain
[1:01:13] I'm talking about Paul why would he say
[1:01:16] that
[1:01:18] why would a man of his caliber a man of
[1:01:21] his
[1:01:22] place in God of where he was and what he
[1:01:25] was doing
[1:01:26] why would he talk like I haven't
[1:01:28] attained
[1:01:32] but then he says but I press let's run
[1:01:35] on down below there I didn't read it but
[1:01:36] he said I pressed the word tomorrow
[1:01:40] for the High Calling
[1:01:46] see why would he talk like that
[1:01:50] sound like he's not interested in what's
[1:01:52] going on
[1:01:54] no I think he was just honest and
[1:01:56] straight don't you
[1:02:00] I was taken this around
[1:02:06] and he seen the biggest death that there
[1:02:08] was
[1:02:10] the disbelief
[1:02:13] of the people that was around him
[1:02:15] that now watch not the do it let's see
[1:02:19] where was that last night
[1:02:22] I don't remember it was on the tape or I
[1:02:24] was reading this morning
[1:02:25] brother Brown said
[1:02:27] I won't ever believer to raise your hand
[1:02:31] he stops he said now I don't want no
[1:02:34] unbeliever to raise your hand
[1:02:36] that's odd you know
[1:02:39] he said I want Believers to raise your
[1:02:41] hand
[1:02:44] pretty good point
[1:02:46] then
[1:02:47] True Believers
[1:02:49] but what is your goal
[1:02:54] well my brother Dale I think this that
[1:02:55] or the other I think we need to do this
[1:02:57] I think we need to do that well okay we
[1:02:59] try to do anything we can to help
[1:03:02] you know
[1:03:04] but
[1:03:05] are you awake in the message
[1:03:10] do you know what's going on
[1:03:15] you know that really to a lot of people
[1:03:16] that follow this message
[1:03:18] if you had a Depression hit they'd go
[1:03:22] Haywire
[1:03:24] because they don't believe it's coming
[1:03:27] because they've been taught that they
[1:03:29] ain't going to be no more persecutions
[1:03:31] there ain't going to be no more
[1:03:33] troubles it we're going to go out of
[1:03:35] here on a flowery bed of ease one day
[1:03:36] and just lord it's going to be wonderful
[1:03:38] and God loves his people and he's not
[1:03:41] going to let us go through no
[1:03:43] persecution I didn't say tribulation
[1:03:46] I put my words right
[1:03:48] well we don't believe in going to the
[1:03:50] tribulation no we're above that but we
[1:03:52] just don't believe there's going to be
[1:03:53] no persecution
[1:03:58] well
[1:04:00] what would he do if it woke up in the OR
[1:04:02] started home today and put your little
[1:04:04] credit card in the gluten it don't work
[1:04:06] oh I guess I better call the credit card
[1:04:09] people
[1:04:11] and you call the credit card people and
[1:04:13] they're not there
[1:04:18] it can be that quick
[1:04:21] it wasn't a life's depression
[1:04:24] that he didn't want the 20s or whatever
[1:04:26] was in there
[1:04:27] I mean
[1:04:31] see at least
[1:04:33] that these things
[1:04:37] well brother Dale that's doomsday stuff
[1:04:39] called God ain't gonna let his bride go
[1:04:41] through no purse no no no problems he
[1:04:44] loves her too much
[1:04:47] well
[1:04:48] I quote the prophet
[1:04:50] you mean
[1:04:52] all of that back through there went
[1:04:53] through what they do and then we're
[1:04:54] going out of here on a flower bed of
[1:04:56] these
[1:04:57] I think he talked against it but you see
[1:05:00] most people have never been told those
[1:05:01] things
[1:05:03] most people have never went through the
[1:05:05] message to try to determine a lot that's
[1:05:07] in the message
[1:05:10] you remember years ago when I called to
[1:05:13] stir among you
[1:05:15] when I began to talk about that
[1:05:16] California could go under
[1:05:20] and I'll still be here
[1:05:28] come on
[1:05:31] no we kind of want to go to under that
[1:05:33] we
[1:05:36] well
[1:05:38] go back to your profit
[1:05:41] if you studied the message
[1:05:44] you know that there was an earthquake at
[1:05:45] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is
[1:05:48] that right you know that it was an
[1:05:50] earthquake hanging on the tree on the
[1:05:52] cross
[1:05:56] you got to get two of them in there
[1:05:58] you know they can be an earthquake in
[1:05:59] California can go under
[1:06:01] and they'll still be here that don't
[1:06:03] mean the resurrections come
[1:06:05] but they will be an earthquake at the
[1:06:06] resurrection
[1:06:11] are you listening
[1:06:15] do you have enough of the uh
[1:06:19] Revelation under the word of God to be
[1:06:21] able to withstand the day that we're
[1:06:22] living
[1:06:24] what if you can't get back home this
[1:06:26] afternoon what are you going to do
[1:06:28] what if you have no home when you get
[1:06:30] there and it's boarded up
[1:06:38] see
[1:06:41] people's getting smart
[1:06:45] and won't call names or states or
[1:06:46] anything but heard this morning that
[1:06:48] there was a place where this
[1:06:51] lesbian lady
[1:06:53] and got orders
[1:06:56] to be able to retrieve
[1:06:58] four or five preachers messages
[1:07:02] because they had preached against
[1:07:03] homosexuality
[1:07:05] and she was a lesbian
[1:07:08] and she's a big thing
[1:07:10] all right
[1:07:12] see I'm getting to where I won't say
[1:07:13] them so much because they're out there
[1:07:16] listening to this too you know in
[1:07:18] anxiety try to be a little smarter than
[1:07:20] they are all right but think about it
[1:07:26] are we at sleep asleep
[1:07:30] is the message well as it woke us up
[1:07:36] now here's a quote from the prophet if
[1:07:38] you'd like he said they fail to see
[1:07:41] or maybe hear or whatever the wording
[1:07:43] there
[1:07:44] The Awakening of the Bride
[1:07:50] well you know what there must be
[1:07:51] somewhere one of these days there's
[1:07:52] going to be Awakening of the Bride or
[1:07:54] something or maybe it's already happened
[1:07:56] and we didn't see it
[1:07:57] no
[1:08:00] well you know what a lot of people
[1:08:01] thought when the two soul hit oh what up
[1:08:04] we walk up this is what we've been
[1:08:06] looking for
[1:08:10] 700 version this is what I've been
[1:08:12] looking for
[1:08:13] people with the same ones that was over
[1:08:15] here moved over here looking for this
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:21] come on
[1:08:24] are we awake enough
[1:08:26] to really understand
[1:08:33] are we awake enough to really comprehend
[1:08:35] what's going on
[1:08:38] and I'm not de-christianizing nobody
[1:08:41] the two quotes I've given brother random
[1:08:43] is talking about the Apostle Paul with
[1:08:45] the new birth a prophet a church-aged
[1:08:48] messenger a great position but yet he
[1:08:50] said he wanted to attain to an out
[1:08:52] Resurrection from among the Dead
[1:08:59] going to give you the one where Paul in
[1:09:01] Ephesians 5 14 run around and referred
[1:09:04] he said it's the bride
[1:09:06] asleep
[1:09:09] in them denominations
[1:09:12] well there's no difference in the
[1:09:14] Baptist that's we're talking about the
[1:09:16] other day I guess you notice now you
[1:09:18] know some words just recently you notice
[1:09:21] now
[1:09:22] that when a move starts among people
[1:09:25] they don't put up a Baptist sign
[1:09:30] Youth for Christ
[1:09:32] worship sinners
[1:09:35] hey
[1:09:36] well because they're getting away from
[1:09:38] the name part
[1:09:41] right
[1:09:44] but now getting away from the name part
[1:09:46] does that mean they got away from the
[1:09:47] doctrine
[1:09:49] no no let's do that same Doctrine
[1:09:54] and brother moat used to say he said you
[1:09:55] get your coat and hat and just move
[1:09:56] houses you know
[1:10:00] all right
[1:10:02] you see Church
[1:10:07] I want to be awake
[1:10:11] not to looking for Russia to come down
[1:10:15] after oil I can see that
[1:10:17] yeah not to look a pope coming out of
[1:10:19] the United States I can see that
[1:10:22] we've already had it when you have a
[1:10:23] pope with what are we Western when you
[1:10:26] have a pot with Western ideas you've got
[1:10:28] a western Pope you got to run out of the
[1:10:30] United States
[1:10:36] don't go too hard but when you got to
[1:10:41] these
[1:10:44] people that do
[1:10:47] the wife is the head of the
[1:10:51] United States
[1:10:54] Kevin said that way without getting in
[1:10:56] trouble
[1:10:59] you know that Kennedy said one time he
[1:11:01] said
[1:11:03] what president said I just accompany her
[1:11:08] you remember that statement I just
[1:11:10] company the First Lady
[1:11:14] do you have to have a woman president
[1:11:18] when you got a Catholic President and
[1:11:21] had them
[1:11:24] you see what I'm talking about
[1:11:26] people are asleep they don't think about
[1:11:28] what's going on
[1:11:31] the first thing I've done after coming
[1:11:33] in this message I voted the last time
[1:11:34] for John F Kennedy found out we put a
[1:11:36] Catholic in the White House they voted
[1:11:38] since then all right
[1:11:40] you know quicker when I found that out
[1:11:42] you know what I've done
[1:11:43] I got into everything I could find
[1:11:46] see how many Catholics there was in
[1:11:49] relationship to the White House
[1:11:52] you know what I mean relationship just
[1:11:54] means Governors that means you know all
[1:11:57] over
[1:11:58] it's not just in the White House
[1:12:01] and I wrote it down one time back at
[1:12:03] that time which would have been about 19
[1:12:04] in 60
[1:12:08] 869
[1:12:10] and there were just thousands of
[1:12:12] Catholics
[1:12:13] already appointed to offices
[1:12:18] because that's what we rode around and
[1:12:19] said it one day he said you get one in
[1:12:21] he said don't bring the rest of it in
[1:12:25] you see then I'm not look for something
[1:12:27] like that
[1:12:31] I'm not preaching about that being oh
[1:12:33] that's death I've always told you I've
[1:12:36] watched this over and over you get
[1:12:38] somebody out of organized religion
[1:12:39] because you're telling them the
[1:12:41] religion's wrong
[1:12:42] they'll stay with you for a while but
[1:12:45] they'll go right back to a higher form
[1:12:47] somewhere else
[1:12:51] you watch it
[1:12:53] but you get them out of the
[1:12:55] denominations by the revelation of Jesus
[1:12:57] Christ
[1:13:00] to see the real truth
[1:13:02] they may have troubles and problems but
[1:13:04] they'll at least hang around
[1:13:08] all right
[1:13:10] but you see
[1:13:12] Paul said I want to
[1:13:15] resurrect out of
[1:13:17] are from among the Dead
[1:13:29] churches are dead he would be saying
[1:13:32] today did your Prophet say that
[1:13:37] come on
[1:13:40] he said when you denominate you die
[1:13:44] is that the words of the prophet
[1:13:47] all right
[1:13:49] see
[1:13:54] but see I want to be part of the
[1:13:56] Resurrection
[1:13:58] that Paul was talking about
[1:14:00] that I know and for certainty that I
[1:14:03] have not fully attained unto her that I
[1:14:07] must attain but yet I'm pressing towards
[1:14:10] the mark of the pride of the high
[1:14:11] calling at least I'm searching for that
[1:14:14] trying for that longing for that
[1:14:17] preaching about that
[1:14:21] and anybody that's ever here the tapes
[1:14:23] are there from 82 up or somewhere along
[1:14:25] in there you're welcome to go back and
[1:14:27] listen to them maybe 2000 now on
[1:14:29] cassettes I mean on the internet
[1:14:32] and see if I haven't always had one
[1:14:35] desire
[1:14:39] to preach the word that was preached by
[1:14:42] the prophet
[1:14:43] it was what the others had brought you
[1:14:45] know Foundation Apostles and Prophets
[1:14:48] and to be able to Proclaim that
[1:14:52] I believe Christ is here
[1:14:55] now I've got a little message and Lord
[1:14:56] will not get to it Wednesday night
[1:15:00] on Hebrews 13 8.
[1:15:04] I'll say it this way then come back to
[1:15:05] it Wednesday
[1:15:07] you show me one
[1:15:09] negative
[1:15:11] point
[1:15:13] I don't mean a sentence I don't mean
[1:15:16] I mean one word I want one negative
[1:15:19] Point thought
[1:15:22] on Hebrews 13 8.
[1:15:27] because if you've got one negative
[1:15:29] thought
[1:15:33] then he's not the same
[1:15:36] I'll get to that Lord willing Wednesday
[1:15:39] listen
[1:15:43] but when we come up like I did in
[1:15:45] and and trying to bring out
[1:15:47] you know
[1:15:49] go ahead with number three where brother
[1:15:51] Brown talking about what the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] was given for
[1:15:59] but when we need it
[1:16:02] the spirit of God raises a standard
[1:16:09] is that right
[1:16:13] now he said when we need it
[1:16:16] what is he he's pouring in his spirit
[1:16:21] then those who are resting out yonder in
[1:16:23] the grave are under the altar of God as
[1:16:24] the scripture says a crying I won't know
[1:16:26] how much longer God's waiting on me and
[1:16:29] you
[1:16:33] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:16:35] adoption time when God can pour into us
[1:16:38] his fullness his power his resurrection
[1:16:41] they when the church in Christ becomes
[1:16:43] so close together until Christ becomes
[1:16:45] visible Among Us and raises the dead and
[1:16:48] we go into rapture
[1:16:50] now I've quoted that for 40 something
[1:16:52] years when I first saw it probably
[1:16:54] longer than that
[1:16:57] you know
[1:17:00] but you say now God is waiting on you
[1:17:03] and I
[1:17:05] what's he waiting on us to do
[1:17:10] number one wake up
[1:17:16] right
[1:17:19] right you know it's hard
[1:17:21] it's hard to to
[1:17:23] um lose a person that can see
[1:17:28] you you get me
[1:17:30] I mean you know you got a person even if
[1:17:32] they're 40 40 vision
[1:17:34] they can still see enough to I remember
[1:17:37] no brother went up to brother would be
[1:17:39] and he was legally blind
[1:17:42] and he'd drive from
[1:17:45] Rogers almost Rogersville to Georgia
[1:17:50] legally blind
[1:17:51] you know
[1:17:55] and there's no way could he write his
[1:17:57] name
[1:17:59] he couldn't go by how to spell the
[1:18:01] letters on the signs
[1:18:05] but he could still see enough to see the
[1:18:06] sign that said
[1:18:09] 25
[1:18:11] 26
[1:18:14] 85
[1:18:17] 441 you know whatever
[1:18:21] you know are you with me
[1:18:24] what do you do if you want to hide
[1:18:25] something you take the night cringe you
[1:18:27] put it around your eyes and you lead
[1:18:28] them around you know and do and they
[1:18:31] don't know where they're at
[1:18:33] but if you can see
[1:18:35] you see
[1:18:37] what wake up
[1:18:44] open up your eyes
[1:18:49] I wish you'd defend me as much as you
[1:18:51] defend others
[1:18:54] I would be a very happy person
[1:18:57] but I realize that won't never happen so
[1:18:59] I'm not concerned about it
[1:19:03] another one of these days I was preached
[1:19:04] to you when I see about that
[1:19:06] I told my wife about it the other day
[1:19:09] just talk to her and wait a little bit
[1:19:11] about it
[1:19:13] something that the Lord's dealing with
[1:19:15] me about it'll come out one day
[1:19:21] but what about it
[1:19:25] the great Apostle Paul and all his
[1:19:28] doings and everything's waiting on you
[1:19:29] and I
[1:19:33] waiting on you and I
[1:19:36] so there's got to be a connection
[1:19:39] between
[1:19:41] him and you and I amen
[1:19:45] Lord bless God one of these days we go
[1:19:47] we're gonna we're gonna get that word
[1:19:49] we're gonna I thought the prophet's
[1:19:51] message was already here
[1:19:54] I didn't know we had to get it I thought
[1:19:57] we already got it
[1:19:59] you know it's in our hands
[1:20:04] well I just don't see that now
[1:20:07] we're looking on Wednesday night on that
[1:20:09] one I just don't see how that he could
[1:20:12] be among us and raise the dead when
[1:20:13] we're going to Rapture then you don't
[1:20:15] believe Hebrews 13. hey forget it stay
[1:20:17] on Wednesday nights you don't have to
[1:20:18] worry about it because you ain't gonna
[1:20:19] believe it anyway
[1:20:25] I made an announcement one time I said I
[1:20:27] wish everybody to be here Wednesday
[1:20:29] night and this couple came they said
[1:20:31] well we we heard your announcement I
[1:20:33] said okay
[1:20:37] but think about it
[1:20:38] if God's waiting on you and I
[1:20:45] when God can pour in his fullness
[1:20:51] and he can raise the dead we go into
[1:20:53] rapture
[1:20:55] I preach to you what I believe
[1:20:57] I believe the final voice to the final
[1:20:59] Age The Prophet says is the Bride of
[1:21:01] Jesus Christ
[1:21:04] I believe the voice of the Resurrection
[1:21:05] is going to come from the bride
[1:21:09] right
[1:21:11] well now how can it come if we're asleep
[1:21:16] how can he come if we don't know where
[1:21:18] we're at
[1:21:23] you know that brother random said on
[1:21:25] Hebrews 13 8.
[1:21:26] he said you say in a way
[1:21:32] he said if your pastor won't take
[1:21:34] Hebrews 13 8 get away from him
[1:21:42] come on
[1:21:44] at least we're to be like brother Tom
[1:21:45] was
[1:21:46] with five bush
[1:21:48] they come up here for a little while and
[1:21:51] one day he called the old Methodist
[1:21:53] preacher up and he said like talk to you
[1:21:56] know where he was going to church when
[1:21:57] he was there
[1:22:00] and he told him a little bit about the
[1:22:01] truth you know in the water baptism the
[1:22:03] one God and
[1:22:04] the old preacher just satire as nice as
[1:22:06] could be you know
[1:22:08] and he said well what do you think about
[1:22:10] that he said I've just got to continue a
[1:22:12] home with church tradition
[1:22:17] you know
[1:22:19] well now how much Blinder or sleep could
[1:22:21] you be
[1:22:24] when the truth is presented
[1:22:29] and we won't take that truth and stand
[1:22:31] on it to the basis of if he's like Paul
[1:22:34] at least let me press the word to mark
[1:22:37] it let at least let me do something
[1:22:41] to get out from among the Dead
[1:22:44] all right you know what he done got him
[1:22:46] out from among the Dead
[1:22:49] you know what Paul done to get him out
[1:22:51] from the among the Dead
[1:22:54] he preached the truth
[1:22:56] right
[1:22:58] amen you know what the dead left
[1:23:03] right
[1:23:05] am I true
[1:23:06] the dead laughed
[1:23:09] well Paul was out from among the Dead
[1:23:12] because of the way he preached the truth
[1:23:14] amen amen what brother ran him out of
[1:23:16] the churches
[1:23:21] then in these early Ministries and
[1:23:22] things that you can go overseas and get
[1:23:24] a big crowd but half a million people in
[1:23:26] one meeting over there or something
[1:23:29] within the last days he's preaching to
[1:23:31] half a dozen in a trailer or something
[1:23:39] you know what because of what he
[1:23:41] believed put him out from among the Dead
[1:23:48] so what do you think about it
[1:23:52] what do you think about the Dead
[1:23:56] when it's our doctrines that are killing
[1:23:58] us
[1:24:01] I remember preaching years ago and I
[1:24:03] didn't keep those they were there but
[1:24:05] well I'm back on the seals in the early
[1:24:08] Ministry
[1:24:09] somewhere about
[1:24:12] 79 78
[1:24:16] anyhow I took the Book of Genesis
[1:24:19] and showing
[1:24:20] the white horse rider the red horse
[1:24:22] rider and the pale
[1:24:24] and you realize that
[1:24:27] because of the doctrine of Cain
[1:24:31] that's what killed Abel
[1:24:36] the doctrine of Cain killed Abel
[1:24:39] the doctrine of Cain that was contrary
[1:24:41] to the truth
[1:24:43] of Abel
[1:24:45] it brought death
[1:24:47] you know what then Cain was put out of
[1:24:49] the garden
[1:24:52] that brought Eternal separation
[1:24:56] right
[1:24:58] what about it
[1:25:03] think about it he becomes visible among
[1:25:05] us and we raise the Dead
[1:25:07] and going to rapture
[1:25:10] all right
[1:25:13] see now put to live few messages
[1:25:15] together
[1:25:18] about death what it is and how to
[1:25:21] destroy it how do you destroy this this
[1:25:24] death we're talking about the
[1:25:26] spiritually revealed word of God is the
[1:25:29] only thing that can destroy
[1:25:33] the death that is within us
[1:25:36] well why wouldn't we want to hear the
[1:25:37] word
[1:25:39] you know
[1:25:41] that should be our number one priority
[1:25:45] you know
[1:25:52] but listen
[1:25:56] let me just bring out a thought
[1:25:59] because
[1:26:01] already had the notes written
[1:26:04] but I want you to think about something
[1:26:05] that I said this past Wednesday night
[1:26:09] and we read where brother Branham said
[1:26:11] on how can I overcome talking about the
[1:26:14] ages that the preceding age
[1:26:17] you know inherits what the next days
[1:26:20] brings
[1:26:22] did you follow that
[1:26:24] or what thought did you have
[1:26:27] I ended it by saying that I was talking
[1:26:29] about in the finality
[1:26:32] in the finality
[1:26:36] you would see that fulfilled I didn't
[1:26:38] know Wade would been bringing to the
[1:26:39] Sunday school class A lot about the
[1:26:41] things and
[1:26:43] I hope maybe he'll bring it up here one
[1:26:45] day
[1:26:49] but you see your Prophet said it
[1:26:53] but I just don't see how now if he just
[1:26:55] said the age after
[1:26:58] couldn't hurt what was wrong
[1:27:00] then our minds would click
[1:27:03] but no he said the preceding age
[1:27:06] the age behind
[1:27:11] would get what the next age
[1:27:13] was bringing
[1:27:17] now we got enough sense to know that
[1:27:20] you can't line that up in the basis of
[1:27:23] saying that the
[1:27:27] the ox
[1:27:28] was greater than the man
[1:27:30] because it was not in that form
[1:27:34] that the man was greater than the lion
[1:27:36] it's not in that form
[1:27:39] I was hoping he was listening to a point
[1:27:42] I was trying to make
[1:27:46] when we get over there
[1:27:49] when this ends down here
[1:27:51] we inherit everything
[1:27:54] you know what
[1:27:56] they inherit too
[1:27:59] I tried to make my point I said we're
[1:28:01] not going to get over on the other side
[1:28:02] or get somewhere you know and look down
[1:28:04] and you know
[1:28:06] you don't have what we have
[1:28:08] this is the age when we have it all
[1:28:10] that's why I brought it around to the
[1:28:12] message that I hoped you caught
[1:28:14] where brother random said
[1:28:17] as son of David
[1:28:21] he said that's a millennium
[1:28:23] he said his son of Abraham that's the
[1:28:25] Royal Grant which is Palestine in the
[1:28:27] area sometime
[1:28:30] he said and the son of man said what did
[1:28:32] he do he said he lost the Earth and said
[1:28:33] he didn't hurt it
[1:28:35] but he said the Son of God in Heritage
[1:28:37] all things that sounds totally contrary
[1:28:42] that's the reason I had it written down
[1:28:43] to bring it out to make sure
[1:28:46] it sounds like it would be the son of
[1:28:48] David maybe would inherit all things
[1:28:51] or even the son of man you could relate
[1:28:54] to it but brother random puts it back
[1:28:56] the Bible puts it back Revelations 21 7
[1:28:59] he that overcome it shall inherit all
[1:29:01] things and I'll be his God and he'll be
[1:29:04] my son
[1:29:06] do you realize my point was if we don't
[1:29:08] have the new birth which is the son of
[1:29:10] God
[1:29:11] do we have no inheritance you realize
[1:29:14] the new birth makes you join heirs with
[1:29:16] Jesus Christ according to the scripture
[1:29:19] the new birth puts you into that Son of
[1:29:22] God position
[1:29:24] so everything will build on top of that
[1:29:26] and when it's finished it will just be a
[1:29:29] pulling part that was my whole I didn't
[1:29:31] get to the license
[1:29:33] he realized what happens in that
[1:29:37] that if you relate those ages together
[1:29:39] and you time together and you just keep
[1:29:42] climbing higher and higher than when
[1:29:43] this age over here
[1:29:48] that sits on his throne
[1:29:50] do you realize the first church age is
[1:29:52] going to sit on his throne
[1:29:55] they said on this Throne back there in
[1:29:57] the spiritual form of the baptism of the
[1:29:59] Holy Ghost they're going to sit on the
[1:30:01] throne with him just as well as you
[1:30:02] sitting on the throne
[1:30:05] why because there's no difference in any
[1:30:07] of us
[1:30:08] there's a difference in the word of the
[1:30:09] age and what God manifested yes
[1:30:12] what he does during the times yes
[1:30:15] but I want you to put that in Hebrews 13
[1:30:18] 8.
[1:30:22] sure we've got to explain that this age
[1:30:24] didn't have the fully revealed word this
[1:30:27] age didn't have this and that or the
[1:30:28] other but I want you to put that in
[1:30:29] Hebrews 13 8 because you're negative
[1:30:34] you just took yourself out you're
[1:30:36] negative
[1:30:38] Luther's justification was the Son of
[1:30:41] God the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:44] the new birth of the time
[1:30:47] so we could inherit all times
[1:30:50] and he'll sit right there on that Throne
[1:30:52] he did overcome was hit me in my trunk
[1:30:53] we're in the millennium
[1:30:55] right
[1:31:01] on the throne of David but you know what
[1:31:05] he'll be son of God's son of man son of
[1:31:07] David Son of Abraham Son of God
[1:31:10] you realize today if this message goes
[1:31:12] to Israel he will first go with Son of
[1:31:14] God because son of God's a baptism of
[1:31:16] the Holy Ghost he's got to go that first
[1:31:18] couldn't go these two prophets walking
[1:31:20] out those two prophets has got to make
[1:31:22] those people realize
[1:31:25] the Son of God is when it paid the price
[1:31:27] who's the Keystone of it all
[1:31:30] the son of God
[1:31:33] that's why that quote I just read to you
[1:31:35] what he's waiting on you and I where he
[1:31:38] can pour in his fullness
[1:31:40] but the new birth makes us join ours
[1:31:42] with Jesus Christ
[1:31:46] Son of God is the Keystone of it all
[1:31:48] right around said the most important
[1:31:50] thing in the world is whether you're
[1:31:51] born again or not
[1:31:53] because it can't be no sort of man
[1:31:55] unless there's a Son of God first
[1:31:58] he said yeah he was he's done a man back
[1:32:00] down that's right and he couldn't give
[1:32:02] nobody eternal life
[1:32:07] come on
[1:32:09] Son of God Son of Man couldn't give
[1:32:11] nobody eternal life he could raise the
[1:32:13] dead he could heal the sick he could do
[1:32:15] everything but he couldn't give eternal
[1:32:16] life why because he had to give up that
[1:32:17] life for it to be able to come back into
[1:32:19] somebody for them to receive eternal
[1:32:21] life
[1:32:22] Son of God
[1:32:24] so brother Randall's right the preceding
[1:32:26] age
[1:32:28] the preceding age will go back and I
[1:32:31] tried to emphasize that to the when the
[1:32:33] Holy Ghost fell on the death Pentecost
[1:32:35] that was Son of God
[1:32:39] and everybody after then can inherit
[1:32:43] they might not attained unto the word
[1:32:46] position that some of the other ages
[1:32:49] would
[1:32:51] but when that age returns to that
[1:32:53] position
[1:32:55] do you realize Luther's just as much a
[1:32:58] part of the grain of wheat as you and I
[1:33:00] are
[1:33:02] you'll remember the two little shoots
[1:33:07] you see I'm trying to show you what
[1:33:08] death really is when you take death
[1:33:11] and don't realize what's going on
[1:33:13] sure
[1:33:15] Son of God inherits all things
[1:33:19] didn't say son of man in nursing and say
[1:33:22] son of David inherited who will that be
[1:33:27] that's in it's the rise in the Sun
[1:33:30] who is this son of man brother Brown
[1:33:32] said in the beginning was the word the
[1:33:34] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:33:40] Son of God
[1:33:42] and when it started it all before the
[1:33:44] foundation of the world
[1:33:46] all these others will come into being
[1:33:48] and when it is we will sit right there
[1:33:50] on the throne with him in the Millennium
[1:33:52] for a thousand years to rule and reign
[1:33:54] with him but you know what Luther will
[1:33:56] be there just as well as you are
[1:33:58] so don't you think he's going to be left
[1:34:00] out of it don't you think he's going to
[1:34:02] be well Luther you sat down over there
[1:34:07] because you're not in this
[1:34:12] if you're following what I'm talking
[1:34:14] about
[1:34:14] there's where you're dying
[1:34:19] you're asleep and don't know it because
[1:34:21] you don't know the truth of the word of
[1:34:23] God
[1:34:25] ever born again believer is a child of
[1:34:28] God a son and daughter of a living God
[1:34:35] and to become the word in the last days
[1:34:37] that we believe the fullness of the
[1:34:39] godhead bodily in the bride right amen
[1:34:42] but you know what that means it's all
[1:34:45] coming to her and
[1:34:48] in the end
[1:34:51] but a random covered this picture twice
[1:34:54] that the sun would become
[1:34:56] subject
[1:34:58] we call it sonship terminating but it
[1:35:00] was really the scripture son but come
[1:35:02] subject himself but Iran puts that in
[1:35:04] the Millennium puts in the future home
[1:35:07] I'll be glad to give you the messages
[1:35:08] one of those Christ Mysteries I think
[1:35:10] the others future home

[1:35:16] the Son of God in hertz the whole thing
[1:35:24] that puts us to everyone right in there
[1:35:28] puts us all right to that basis of where
[1:35:30] I started off with
[1:35:33] awake
[1:35:35] to the revealed word
[1:35:40] could you just see Paul standing there
[1:35:42] preaching to those people that had come
[1:35:44] on over there later claiming to be
[1:35:46] Christians
[1:35:51] who wouldn't have been something for
[1:35:52] Paul go back to Rome
[1:35:55] and see them people like that
[1:35:58] you know if he could live when I won't
[1:35:59] come back wouldn't have been something
[1:36:01] for him to went over there and seen the
[1:36:02] Roman Catholic Church the claim to come
[1:36:04] from his Doctrine
[1:36:09] I think we need to wake up
[1:36:11] last thing statement I want to make is
[1:36:13] where he says from the seed not hour of
[1:36:15] the paragraph 10 100 and 101
[1:36:18] number eight on your notes you want to
[1:36:20] put it up or anything to read it
[1:36:22] says the full word is to be born into
[1:36:25] manifestation
[1:36:27] again
[1:36:29] in this day
[1:36:31] the full word
[1:36:33] is to be born into manifestation
[1:36:35] do you know what
[1:36:37] we couldn't be here if Luther hadn't
[1:36:38] brought his message
[1:36:42] so he's going inherit all things with us

[1:37:07] everybody
[1:37:08] this end time message is not for
[1:37:10] everybody
[1:37:12] it's far that predestinated seed
[1:37:16] the rest inherit what they get
[1:37:23] but there's going to be a people that's
[1:37:25] going to stand on this Earth
[1:37:26] and look death in the face and walk
[1:37:28] right up to it and say forget it

[1:45:20] hear the truth
[1:45:24] because it gives you something to stand
[1:45:25] on
[1:45:28] into a tape the other night and the
[1:45:30] prophet he was talking he prayed for a
[1:45:32] little girl
[1:45:35] I think maybe he might have prayed twice
[1:45:37] I know he prayed once
[1:45:41] her lady and he said now look at my hand
[1:45:47] said
[1:45:48] is it still there she said yes
[1:45:53] he prayed again he said now just look my
[1:45:57] hand
[1:45:58] he was holding her hand you know
[1:46:00] remember the hand assignment
[1:46:03] she said it's still there
[1:46:05] did your hand shows it
[1:46:08] he made this statement
[1:46:11] now listen to it
[1:46:14] he said it's not
[1:46:17] what you pray
[1:46:22] that caught my attention to me
[1:46:27] he said it's the faith you've got
[1:46:30] it's not the words
[1:46:34] he said it's the faith you got
[1:46:37] he turned around to her and he said
[1:46:40] now young lady said
[1:46:43] close your eyes
[1:46:47] took her hand
[1:46:48] that the problem still dark
[1:46:51] but he stopped and he said
[1:46:54] now Satan
[1:46:56] he said God called me to pray for the
[1:46:59] sick
[1:47:01] he said my commission is to pray for the
[1:47:04] sick
[1:47:05] he said now Satan
[1:47:09] you can't withstand that because it's
[1:47:11] the gift of God
[1:47:18] what was he putting it on not the words
[1:47:20] he said but the faith in his heart in
[1:47:23] the commission that was brought
[1:47:27] he told the lady he said look at the
[1:47:29] hand
[1:47:32] she said it's gone
[1:47:37] did you see the point he said it's not
[1:47:40] the words you say
[1:47:42] it's the faith
[1:47:47] in what you believe
[1:47:50] you remember the any statement he went
[1:47:52] on to make
[1:47:54] said he told me he said you get the
[1:47:57] people to believe you that nothing can
[1:47:59] stand in your way not even cancer
[1:48:06] the church
[1:48:09] we're on that point right now
[1:48:19] if you can believe it
[1:48:23] because it's based on what you believe
[1:48:31] put it right back into your lap that's
[1:48:33] what you believe
[1:48:39] if you believe the person praying for
[1:48:42] you
[1:48:43] can contact God
[1:48:47] you've made your conduct
[1:48:53] that's what you believe
[1:48:57] it's based on you
[1:48:58] in your faith
