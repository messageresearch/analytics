[2:45] way will be traveling this weekend he's
[2:47] preaching at brother Gerald hughes's
[2:49] church this weekend in Columbia South
[2:51] Carolina so remember
[2:53] that also we have a uh email from
[2:58] Patricia the one that had the the young
[3:01] black lady that had the little girl that
[3:03] she brought right and I won't read it
[3:06] all but I read the high points of it it
[3:08] says uh this email was is long overdue
[3:11] she said she meant to write it for a
[3:13] long time but it says I want to thank
[3:14] you so much for the warm way in which
[3:16] you received myself and the
[3:18] three-year-old daughter of my my friend
[3:20] into your church this summer we felt
[3:22] like we always belong we had always
[3:25] belong and I suppose that I think of
[3:28] where we originally came all came from
[3:30] that's the very truth it's was such a
[3:33] blessing to spend the summer
[3:34] fellowshipping with you and also she
[3:37] says at the bottom it
[3:38] says uh I thank God for his mercy and
[3:43] Grace and ask that you lift up my family
[3:46] and I as well as the church congregation
[3:48] here in California so just remember her
[3:51] she sent a letter and some more
[3:53] information and now we'll go over the
[3:55] prayer request that we have have one
[3:57] here I can't quite read it but I think
[3:59] it's says that sister Gail knocked
[4:00] brother brother dick off of a
[4:03] ladder and uh he fell he's got a big
[4:06] knot upside his head so just remember
[4:08] that that's I think that's what it says
[4:10] on purpose it doesn't say that but I'm
[4:12] sure it was also remember Gabby too I
[4:15] was just thinking of her back there
[4:16] she's going to have a baby before long
[4:18] and just remember her also also we have
[4:22] some uh email request here we have one
[4:25] says please remember brother Clarence
[4:27] stride in prayer he has he's suffering
[4:30] kidney stones and other problems so just
[4:32] remember him he's from Canada this is
[4:35] from Gerald Lush his church I I presume
[4:38] that's that's who sent the email so just
[4:41] remember those also brother Ernie sent
[4:44] once says please request prayer for
[4:46] brother Murphy who is currently in China
[4:49] so just remember
[4:51] him also we have one here from brother
[4:54] James uh I think we've prayed for him
[4:56] his family it says I hope you will pray
[4:59] I want to ask ask prayer again my
[5:00] marriage is in is breaking up and unless
[5:03] the Lord intervenes I will not be able
[5:05] to save it I think we've prayed for his
[5:06] family before so just remember that he
[5:09] sending another email he's having
[5:10] problems with his wife she don't want to
[5:12] listen and and do things the right way
[5:15] also remember this is an update from the
[5:18] ones in Iran it says uh let's see I want
[5:21] to send an update out the trial started
[5:24] on the 21st of September and the verdict
[5:26] was supposed to come today but the trial
[5:28] has continued there's an attorney there
[5:31] with our
[5:32] brother uh this is the one that they're

[5:36] says it appears that verdict may be
[5:38] pushed out until next week please
[5:40] continue in your prayer for God to work

[31:05] now in doing that I I appreciate you
[31:09] coming along and helping me and and
[31:11] everything and and you know and it shows
[31:13] that you're you're listening and you
[31:16] know things and bringing back to me uh
[31:19] helps and things that you know uh I need
[31:21] it but uh the word compound sister Trudy
[31:26] is talking to her the other day about it
[31:28] see the word compound is it's a word
[31:31] that means like you mix
[31:34] something it's actually a mixing of
[31:36] things uh it's only found one time in
[31:39] the the scriptures and it's found in
[31:42] let's see where it
[31:44] is
[31:45] Exodus Exodus 30 and 25 but what it's
[31:49] talking about D is a compounding or
[31:51] mixing together of the ointments and you
[31:56] know they had people specifically set
[31:58] aside to mix those things together but
[32:01] now what I'm trying to get you to see
[32:03] about compound is is that
[32:08] uh once you mix
[32:12] something there is no way to separate
[32:16] that right now you take white plant
[32:20] paint you mix it with black paint you
[32:22] going to have gray or something and
[32:24] there's no
[32:25] way for you to ever be able to uh make
[32:30] that either
[32:31] white you can add all the white you want
[32:34] to to it but it'll still have the black
[32:37] tinge to it you can add all the black
[32:39] you want to it but it's still going to
[32:41] have a certain amount all right but now
[32:44] in God what has been our
[32:47] Point our point is that you can't have
[32:51] one of the seven compound names and I
[32:54] know there's more than than just what
[32:55] we're giving you because there they're
[32:57] they're in the scriptures but they're
[32:59] all contained in the seven compound
[33:02] names and
[33:04] uh but you can't separate them remember
[33:07] what the prophet said he said you can't
[33:10] separate them right I gave you a bunch
[33:12] of quotes are kind of in the beginning
[33:14] of what we were talking on he said
[33:16] there's there's no way to
[33:19] separate those
[33:21] names you can't make one greater than
[33:25] the other right righten
[33:30] it it's it's brother ROM I gave you
[33:32] where he said it's the attributes of God
[33:36] he said it was even the attitude of God
[33:39] he said it was his nature
[33:41] right all how can you separate it and
[33:45] see that's what I believe are are what
[33:47] we're
[33:49] doing and it doesn't matter to me to
[33:52] keep saying it over and over and over
[33:53] and over if you get upset at it just lay
[33:55] out next time I preach you might have to
[33:57] listen to that service you can get it
[33:59] after
[34:00] then but now
[34:04] listen once they're put together how can
[34:07] they be separated right
[34:09] amen and how can they not be put
[34:12] together when brother R said you can't
[34:14] separate those names from Jesus Christ
[34:18] right cuz he is those names that is him
[34:22] revealing himself down through the Old
[34:25] Testament you know and using the titles
[34:27] that we're using are coming out of the
[34:29] Old Testament
[34:31] scriptures and it's showing that if he's
[34:34] the same yesterday today and
[34:36] forever all right then how can you make
[34:40] one thing greater than the
[34:44] other right all right we've been dealing
[34:47] with Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided
[34:50] sacrifice you know all right now we look
[34:54] at that and we're quick to re recognize
[34:57] him as our
[34:59] sacrifice and we would not D tell
[35:02] anybody that we're not
[35:05] saved right
[35:08] right but now when you come to Jehovah
[35:13] rapi the Lord that Health all of thy
[35:17] diseases well yeah he can heal some
[35:20] things and yeah he can do this or yeah
[35:24] he can do that but we don't put it on
[35:26] the same level as our
[35:28] Salvation now listen I know what your
[35:31] mind capability
[35:34] is you'll automatically run with the
[35:36] fact that well the the
[35:39] stripes the
[35:41] stripes that healing is not Eternal but
[35:45] one day it will be amen that's right all
[35:49] right now is he going to die again to do
[35:52] that no you agree that one day it'll be
[35:55] Eternal right you agree that one day
[35:57] these bodies will be Eternal I believe
[35:59] that all right now if not you better be
[36:03] hoping you can get you new and or do
[36:04] something and if you even get a new one
[36:06] it would have to be Eternal that's right
[36:09] but see that's the point I'm trying to
[36:12] make we put the emphasis upon our
[36:15] Salvation real
[36:18] firm yes I'm saved well is any way now
[36:22] that that I could convince you that you
[36:24] wouldn't say no no I'm
[36:30] saved all right there's any way that I
[36:33] convince you that you're not healed
[36:36] right that don't take much
[36:40] convincing when you're looking at the
[36:43] circumstances
[36:45] right and don't take a lot of
[36:48] convincing so we're not putting our
[36:50] healing on the same
[36:53] basis as the
[36:55] salvation and remember what I was trying
[36:58] to bring out you can say Well it it was
[37:00] beaten but if he hadn't went to Calvary
[37:03] and died and gave his life that beating
[37:07] of his back would not have healed you
[37:10] amen do you understand amen it would
[37:14] have not have healed you had he not died
[37:15] on
[37:17] Calvary because the healing is in the
[37:20] blood it's the life of the
[37:23] blood it's not the compound you can hold
[37:26] m is faith in the blood that was shed
[37:30] for you and I and doing that the life
[37:32] had to go out amen all right now we what
[37:36] I'm trying to do is me and you I'm say
[37:38] me first is to get to the bases that we
[37:41] can put you know and not look at our
[37:44] things like these two bottles of olive
[37:46] oil and those on tape one of them is
[37:49] pretty good size and the other one's
[37:52] small well see then we say well now now
[37:56] now now now brother this is my healing
[37:59] this is my
[38:01] salvation oh my that's right
[38:04] no all right then maybe we pick up
[38:07] another bottle and set it up and it's
[38:11] smaller than the other two I guess
[38:13] that's Jehovah Banner or something you
[38:16] know maybe that's Jehovah tiin you or or
[38:21] righteousness but see how can that
[38:25] be that's not
[38:29] true your Prophet said if he is Jehovah
[38:32] Gyra the Lord's provided
[38:36] sacrifice then he must be Jehovah
[38:39] rapi your healer am all right now when
[38:43] we get that on the same
[38:45] level you're going to see a change of
[38:48] the body am
[38:49] right amen I believe that all right now
[38:54] because our salvations are said we won't
[38:57] dare say we're not
[39:01] saved well now now now brother Dale I've
[39:03] Got My Confession now listen to what I'm
[39:06] saying I go to so get get offended at
[39:09] me but I'm right trying what I'm trying
[39:12] to say I'm trying to show you exactly
[39:15] where you and I both are
[39:18] standing we say My Confession and my
[39:21] healing is great I agree with
[39:25] you you got to take but then we go to
[39:28] the
[39:29] doctor
[39:34] right now listen do we go anywhere you
[39:38] remember Sunday now do we go anywhere to
[39:41] try to get something about our
[39:42] Salvation
[39:49] right we put it there don't ride on my
[39:53] Tombstone right on there I died in faith
[39:58] MH but do we put it on the same
[40:01] level that's why we're not getting
[40:04] healed now you understand what I'm
[40:06] saying me I need healing just like you
[40:09] need healing
[40:14] right I'm not talking about you I know
[40:17] how people in their little petty
[40:18] feelings gets offended and I'm not going
[40:21] to apologize for what I said about the
[40:24] the restroom business that you know
[40:26] everybody running in there for the
[40:27] kidney problem I'm not going to
[40:29] apologize cuz I said what I meant and
[40:31] meant what I said and I said it right
[40:33] right now I'm not talking about you
[40:34] that's got a
[40:36] problem now if you got offended at me on
[40:38] that you better talk to God because I
[40:40] was right I was telling
[40:43] you exactly and I said it if you got a
[40:46] problem you go to the
[40:47] bathroom but your problem is when you
[40:50] let your kidneys and your things or
[40:52] anything else hinder you from listening
[40:54] to the word of God right amen you let
[40:58] your kids you let your things happen and
[41:00] you let it hinder
[41:02] you right so you get offended at me
[41:05] because I say something about the
[41:07] bathroom
[41:10] well I'm not saying anything about
[41:12] anybody's got a kidney
[41:14] problem the only thing I've said about
[41:16] it and I still believe it we pray for
[41:18] the
[41:20] sick
[41:22] right you know but now you got kid
[41:26] problems and won't come up and let us
[41:27] pray for you you know
[41:30] what I know it you'll keep your kidney
[41:34] problems right amen now that's as honest
[41:37] as I can be now the Lord showed me that
[41:39] the other day and if I'm wrong you come
[41:40] tell me and show me where I'm wrong but
[41:42] if you keep your problems and you
[41:44] confess your problems wrong you keep
[41:46] your problems that's right you can't say
[41:50] by Stripes I'm
[41:52] Healed and then in the next turn turn
[41:55] around and SA
[41:56] but uh you don't understand my problem
[42:00] but you see I know people gets offended
[42:02] at me for what I say I'm
[42:05] sorry I don't want the education to be
[42:08] able to smoothe it
[42:11] over I just say it like it is and I
[42:14] offend you I'm
[42:19] sorry but if you take that what I say to
[42:22] you and you say it
[42:24] right is you like I said the other day
[42:26] you know people tell me said Brother D I
[42:29] can't sleep in the middle of the day cuz
[42:31] if I sleep in the middle of the day I
[42:32] can't sleep at
[42:35] night well evidently Sunday night and
[42:39] Wednesday night none of you
[42:44] sleep that's
[42:46] mean but is it the
[42:48] truth you can sleep in church it don't
[42:51] hurt you but if you lay down on the
[42:53] couch at
[42:54] home and take a out you see what I'm
[42:58] saying I try to say something in the
[43:01] nicest way I
[43:02] can but I just don't have a nice way of
[43:05] saying it I'm
[43:06] sorry but now
[43:09] listen can we put everything on the same
[43:12] level
[43:15] that's we'll keep repeating
[43:18] this cuz you notice I hadn't tried to go
[43:20] into one to the other on it I'm just
[43:22] trying to pick it up as I
[43:25] go but what I want you to understand
[43:28] tonight is one
[43:32] thing if God ever was he still is
[43:36] amen and whatever he was he still
[43:40] is or else he changed
[43:43] somewhere
[43:45] right now if he changed I won't know
[43:47] where he's
[43:49] at because according to my Bible Malachi
[43:53] 3 I think he said I'm godten I change
[43:55] not that's right
[43:57] am
[43:59] now but I want to nail something hard
[44:02] tonight on one thing cuz I intended to
[44:05] preach this message last and I'm sure I
[44:08] won't forget it and do it but I want you
[44:12] to go over to
[44:14] Exodus with
[44:17] me thank
[44:19] you Exodus
[44:25] 48
[44:27] wait a
[44:29] minute get
[44:30] it can't be 48 let's go to
[44:37] 33 I put a got so many notes written on
[44:41] top of notes you want to see it cuz I'm
[44:43] using the same notes to do all these
[44:45] sermons from and that's hard to do so I
[44:48] write right over the top of it I
[44:49] preached on
[44:50] this but look at it in
[44:53] uh Exodus 33 and4
[44:57] now let's go back up
[45:02] to let me let me give you the
[45:04] story and then we'll start reading about
[45:07] the 12th verse this is where
[45:11] Moses actually verse 11 was talking to
[45:16] God face to face that's what it says
[45:20] right there as a man speaketh unto his
[45:23] friend that's how the Lord spake to
[45:24] Moses
[45:27] now that's something in it that the Lord
[45:30] spake to Moses face to
[45:34] face all
[45:36] right but look at verse
[45:41] 12 he's talking about bringing up the
[45:44] people sayest unto me bring up this
[45:46] people and th thou Hast not let me know
[45:50] whom thou Wilt send with me yet thou
[45:53] Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou
[45:56] Hast found Grace in my
[45:58] sight now therefore I pray thee if I
[46:02] have found Grace in thy
[46:05] sight show me now thy way right
[46:10] listen that I may Know
[46:15] Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight
[46:20] consider that this nation is thy
[46:24] people and he said my presence shall
[46:31] go with thee
[46:36] right and I will give thee
[46:39] rest you
[46:41] remember what I've always tried to get
[46:43] you to see about
[46:46] Moses he spoke God spoke to God face to
[46:52] face but he wanted to see him one
[46:54] day
[47:00] they wanted to see
[47:04] him Verse 18 show me thy Glory he wanted
[47:09] to see
[47:13] him right in the middle the Lord
[47:16] said my president shall be shall go with
[47:20] thee now that's Jehovah
[47:24] sha right
[47:28] that the Lord's
[47:31] presence are the Lord is
[47:35] here now what about all of the things of
[47:38] Moses I'm trying to get a background and
[47:40] then just say a few words what about all
[47:42] of the things of
[47:45] Moses like at the burning bush Exodus 3
[47:52] and14 when he was standing there talking
[47:54] to the Lord
[47:57] and the Lord said I am that I am y
[48:01] right what about all of the things and
[48:03] the times that God spoke to
[48:10] Moses he was a human being
[48:13] mortal and he wanted to see
[48:17] God but all of that time God was trying
[48:20] to get Moses to see that he was with
[48:24] him
[48:27] right that's why we took this 14th verse
[48:30] right out of the middle of it see go on
[48:31] down reading and you'll find where he's
[48:32] trying to uh want to see God right right
[48:37] in between there God says I'm present
[48:39] Jehovah
[48:42] shma I'm present with
[48:45] you
[48:46] now I thought we believe the scripture
[48:49] you know that where Jesus said I'll be
[48:52] with thee
[48:54] always always
[49:00] but
[49:01] yet sure as human
[49:05] Mortals we want to see God right we want
[49:09] to see things
[49:12] happen we want to see healing or
[49:16] something and then we'll say well God is
[49:20] with
[49:23] us but to me God was trying to tell
[49:26] Moses said
[49:29] Moses I've been with
[49:34] you you've destroyed the
[49:38] Egyptians you've destroyed a
[49:42] nation that's your
[49:45] word said you know that wasn't
[49:50] you was see
[49:52] one there's nothing wrong with wanting
[49:55] to see more more of God now get to me
[49:58] right Moses wanted to see God more real
[50:01] than he had seen and there's not
[50:03] anything wrong with that all of us do
[50:05] and we
[50:08] will but if we don't recognize he's with
[50:12] us amen like I'm tried to tell you a god
[50:15] up in
[50:22] heaven no I want a god present with me
[50:28] amen I want him with
[50:31] me I don't want it to be that I've got
[50:34] to wait for him to come
[50:41] down so get the point what I'm saying
[50:44] now Moses wanted to see God after God
[50:49] had
[50:49] said this is my presence here with
[50:54] you
[50:56] I've been with your mouth I've destroyed
[50:59] a
[51:00] nation I wipe out all of your
[51:04] enemies I'll take you
[51:09] through
[51:14] right that's what I'm saying now get it
[51:16] right
[51:19] please I want to see more of God don't
[51:21] you right and you know what when we walk
[51:25] off this Earth I still want to see more
[51:28] of God right so get me right
[51:34] now but if we don't recognize what we
[51:38] have right the basis of Moses that's
[51:42] what God was telling him the only way
[51:44] now Moses that I can become visible to
[51:48] your
[51:51] eyesight it's for you to remember the
[51:54] things where I've been present with you
[52:02] right well I'm brother tell you just
[52:04] don't understand sometimes I feel him
[52:06] sometimes I don't what's that got to do
[52:08] with right amen you making God a
[52:12] liar God said I'm with you amen amen
[52:16] right who was it uh was it joob who
[52:20] would it said who would they said if I
[52:22] make my bed in hell right AR with
[52:31] me but you see we keep looking out
[52:35] somewhere
[52:40] else now I tried to explic
[52:44] it we say
[52:46] salvation we will dare not never confess
[52:50] anything wrong in our
[52:54] salvation
[52:55] but yet in their healings we won't put
[52:58] that on the same
[53:02] basis
[53:05] now Moses was a mortal he wanted to do
[53:08] it and I do
[53:09] too I want to see God move on the scene
[53:13] in every heart and lives in in
[53:17] you more than I want to see him in
[53:21] myself that's always been my
[53:24] desire
[53:26] that's what tore me up when the the
[53:29] brother said at the pillar of fire was
[53:30] up here at the pull pit and then he said
[53:33] went down through the aisle this brother
[53:35] said the Lord's leaving us I sat right
[53:37] here and said no way he's not leaving us
[53:40] he's doing exactly what I asked him to
[53:42] do was leave up from here and get off of
[53:45] it being on me and get with you and let
[53:47] you see God am and let you call for rain
[53:51] and you call for the
[53:53] things I want to see God in your
[53:58] life brother I want to see you in myself
[54:00] okay you're
[54:04] selfish I'm sorry that's
[54:08] right I want to see him in your life
[54:11] amen and I love to hear your testimonies
[54:16] amen of telling me what God has
[54:24] done brother Marlo the other
[54:28] day he'd been having trouble he'd been
[54:31] sick he looked over at Danny and saw
[54:33] Danny raising his
[54:37] hands you know what he done he entered a
[54:40] law of Faith you know what God healed
[54:44] him bless
[54:47] him that's what I want to
[54:51] see I want to see God in your life I
[54:54] want you to tell me about about the the
[54:55] god that you
[54:58] serve I love for you to tell me those
[55:02] things and I say well it's working it's
[55:05] working
[55:06] amen you know what I'm saying is the
[55:08] truth in this message 99% of the
[55:11] preachers wants all of the glory put
[55:14] behind the pull
[55:16] pit and what they're doing and what
[55:19] they're
[55:24] happening
[55:27] brother told me he said brother there
[55:28] you're wrong said press on and your own
[55:31] I said I'm pressing on for the people
[55:34] that's right Lord I want to see God in
[55:36] your
[55:39] life then when I see God in your life I
[55:42] know I preach the truth right amen God
[55:45] it's manifested in your life
[55:48] amen but if we don't believe he's
[55:50] present well now in a
[55:52] way see now you can take a the great
[55:55] discourse of the message I can just hear
[55:57] it I can hear the computers clicking as
[55:59] there say I'll get him on this
[56:01] one cuz he don't understand that God was
[56:06] Alpha and nothing in between and then
[56:09] he's
[56:10] Omega I don't believe that you don't
[56:14] believe what brother R said no I don't
[56:15] believe you understand what brother R
[56:17] said cuz he's the one that went on and
[56:18] said said everything in between and if
[56:21] he Hebrews
[56:23] 138
[56:25] I just ran a few you look at them where
[56:28] brother R was talking about the presence
[56:30] of God he said and that's always been
[56:36] here but do we believe it one of these
[56:40] days it's
[56:42] coming all right
[56:44] now one of these days is coming one of
[56:48] these days I'm going get my
[56:52] healing but I'll have you to know I'm
[56:57] saved you don't say one of these days
[57:00] you're going to be saved right
[57:03] right right
[57:06] right you say you're
[57:09] saved you're not looking out
[57:16] there remember the compound of
[57:22] it if he ever is Jehovah
[57:26] he had to be that before the world if he
[57:28] ever is Jehovah rapi that's right he had
[57:32] to be that before the
[57:33] world that's right and where would there
[57:35] be one attribute larger than the
[57:39] other it's Father Son and Holy Ghost the
[57:42] three attributes of God is one greater
[57:45] than the other now they're all three
[57:48] one
[57:50] right cuz there not
[57:53] three
[57:56] it's not three separate identities or
[57:59] persons it's three manifestations of the
[58:02] same
[58:04] God now was he any less God when he was
[58:07] Jehovah in the Old Testament than he was
[58:09] when he was walking the shores of
[58:12] galile come
[58:16] on is he any less God in the baptism of
[58:19] the Holy Ghost than he was when he
[58:21] walked here brother R said he's here
[58:23] tonight just like he was on the day of
[58:26] Pentecost right said he's here like he
[58:29] was when he walked the shores of Galilee
[58:32] right but do we believe that that's
[58:37] right well I don't know brother so and
[58:42] so says it's this way well all right
[58:45] let's get out of where brother so and
[58:46] so's at right right you know yep no
[58:52] problems the problems is staying here
[58:55] and keeping the doctrines
[59:00] here but you understand that is he
[59:03] Jehovah
[59:04] shamama which means his presence are the
[59:09] Lord is
[59:16] present let's see I can't figure that
[59:18] now where I picked that n from oh okay I
[59:21] got it now I'm looking down to reading
[59:23] my own note from let's go to Ezekiel
[59:33] 48 I knew that 48 had to be in there
[59:39] right
[59:46] okay Ezekiel
[59:52] 48:35 he's measuring out all of the
[59:55] things of the Ruben the G and the sides
[59:58] and the the buildings and the things and
[1:00:00] all and then watch what he says it was
[1:00:03] around about
[1:00:05] 18,000 measures in the name of the city
[1:00:10] from that day shall be the Lord is
[1:00:15] here huh now that is the
[1:00:21] promise of the millennium amen all right
[1:00:26] y That's page 5 55 through 5 let's see
[1:00:32] 551 through 554 the seal
[1:00:37] book brother Ram is explaining about the
[1:00:41] children of Israel and how that it will
[1:00:43] come into a millennial
[1:00:45] Reign and the name of that City then
[1:00:48] will be the Lord is
[1:00:53] there
[1:00:55] Jehovah
[1:00:57] shamama the Lord is
[1:01:00] present all right but now are we going
[1:01:03] to wait until the
[1:01:04] Millennium to recognize he's with
[1:01:10] us now explain to
[1:01:14] me how you can have the new
[1:01:19] birth and that new birth not be his
[1:01:23] presence
[1:01:25] pre now explain that one
[1:01:30] okay how can you have a new birth and
[1:01:32] that not be his presence
[1:01:34] right amen what did you
[1:01:37] get well I shouted spoke the tongu I CRI
[1:01:41] well here you go
[1:01:45] see but
[1:01:47] Moses after speaking with God face to
[1:01:51] face right
[1:01:52] amen I than mistaken I believe I'm
[1:01:55] quoting it correctly I believe brother R
[1:01:56] use lip to
[1:01:58] ear or mouth to mouth one of the two is
[1:02:02] huge but
[1:02:05] irregardless of all of the things that
[1:02:08] God had done Moses was human enough to
[1:02:11] want to see more and I do too
[1:02:15] amen why would you read the word of God
[1:02:17] why would you study the message if you
[1:02:18] didn't want to see or I mean my goodness
[1:02:22] folks but listen
[1:02:25] the only way that he can save
[1:02:29] you
[1:02:31] now now listen to what I'm saying the
[1:02:33] only way anybody could ever be saved was
[1:02:35] the fact that God had to come to Earth
[1:02:38] and die right amen now you agree with
[1:02:43] that right
[1:02:46] you God had to come and
[1:02:50] die there's no salvation you say well
[1:02:53] these Jews will come in 145 days will
[1:02:55] come in they'll only come in because of
[1:02:57] Calvary
[1:02:59] right the Bible said he died once for
[1:03:03] all that's right there's not a Salvation
[1:03:06] for somebody
[1:03:08] besides any of the groups that's
[1:03:14] died but how can you
[1:03:16] separate salvation from his
[1:03:22] presence sure
[1:03:25] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] and you know that in the book of Acts
[1:03:29] they had many feelings of the Holy
[1:03:31] Spirit but they only had one
[1:03:33] birth but they had many feelings right
[1:03:37] right there's many
[1:03:39] feelings right but only one
[1:03:46] birth sure we preached it and everything
[1:03:48] else that God is going to become present
[1:03:51] with
[1:03:52] us and raise the dead and we go in
[1:03:55] Rapture but you haven't heard me
[1:03:57] preaching it like most everybody else
[1:04:00] preaches
[1:04:05] it you go back and check what I tried to
[1:04:08] preach to you about what five or 6
[1:04:10] months ago when I was talking
[1:04:13] about how that brother randam up until
[1:04:16] 62 long to L of 62 he was still looking
[1:04:20] for something to come but when he
[1:04:22] entered that with opening of the seal
[1:04:24] he never looked back no more amen he
[1:04:28] never looked forward either he was
[1:04:30] looking at what was standing right there
[1:04:32] because God was present with
[1:04:37] him what did Brother rold say even back
[1:04:39] before then
[1:04:44] listen where's it
[1:04:47] at
[1:04:52] um every prison when it turns you I'm
[1:04:56] trying to find
[1:04:58] it yeah look at the last one seven
[1:05:00] compound names with Jehovah in the
[1:05:02] bottom of the page preaching
[1:05:05] 5510 and look what he
[1:05:07] said the last one of his Redemptive
[1:05:10] names it appeared to Abraham he said I
[1:05:13] am Jehovah rapi the provided one to
[1:05:15] provide a sacrifice provide the way what
[1:05:18] is it God will provide
[1:05:21] it and I am
[1:05:24] Jehovah that Health
[1:05:27] Thee I am thy
[1:05:30] righteousness I am thy
[1:05:32] peace I am thy Shield I am thy banner
[1:05:37] and I'm ever present to perform
[1:05:43] it amen you see what I mean ever present
[1:05:47] to perform
[1:05:52] it Jehovah
[1:05:56] means like a father with his
[1:05:59] family that was what it was derived from
[1:06:02] back there in the Old Testament that's
[1:06:04] why it's not used in Genesis 1 because
[1:06:07] he's still self-existing
[1:06:09] but in Genesis 2 it's used lord god
[1:06:12] Jehovah
[1:06:15] Elohim God came down to reveal himself
[1:06:19] to be present and show me where he ever
[1:06:21] went back up right
[1:06:28] but do we believe he's here or not right
[1:06:30] no brother Dale he's coming well then
[1:06:33] all that series I preached on the second
[1:06:35] coming is blowned out of your mind and
[1:06:37] you slept through it or done something
[1:06:39] through it right you didn't understand
[1:06:42] all I was trying to
[1:06:45] explain because he started his second
[1:06:48] coming on the day of
[1:06:50] Pentecost there's things in this day
[1:06:52] will finish in the second coming mean
[1:06:54] yes but it'll be no different
[1:06:58] God he was ever present with every
[1:07:03] believer he was their
[1:07:05] healer he was their
[1:07:09] savior he was their Banner he was their
[1:07:12] peace he was their Shepherd
[1:07:15] amen and he was ever
[1:07:19] present you know what's the reason now
[1:07:22] get on to this so take us six months on
[1:07:24] this
[1:07:25] probably cuz like I said we don't
[1:07:27] believe him to be the same as Jehovah
[1:07:30] Gyra and Jehovah RI we want Jehovah Gyra
[1:07:33] to be something big Jehovah RI to be
[1:07:36] something small and then up and down and
[1:07:38] we just zigzag it and trying to find
[1:07:40] some kind of a something to satisfy our
[1:07:42] own
[1:07:47] ego but if we don't believe him to be je
[1:07:50] Jehovah
[1:07:51] shama then how can you ever be saved
[1:07:54] right that's right
[1:07:56] amen you can't be folks that's a mental
[1:08:00] concept right that's all you got is a
[1:08:03] mental concept of salvation you don't
[1:08:05] have a personal experience of Jesus
[1:08:07] Christ amen you don't have eternal life
[1:08:10] within your soul by the new birth you
[1:08:12] have a mental concept that youve trying
[1:08:14] to confess yourself into
[1:08:17] it
[1:08:21] amen you're trying to work it up
[1:08:28] yep but he said I'm ever present to
[1:08:33] perform now do you think that Martin
[1:08:36] Luther I use that because the ages and
[1:08:39] the way one of people preaching on oh
[1:08:41] they got him in Alpha and
[1:08:47] Omega you don't think he was present
[1:08:50] with Martin Luther and adj you live by
[1:08:52] faith
[1:08:57] now he's not present like he is now I
[1:09:00] got the quote from the
[1:09:02] prophet now did did Luther house a new
[1:09:05] birth
[1:09:08] amen now if you had the new birth and
[1:09:11] you have the new birth what's the
[1:09:13] difference in your new birth and his new
[1:09:15] birth
[1:09:17] right that's why there was 120 in the
[1:09:20] upper room that received that new birth
[1:09:23] at one position
[1:09:25] but everybody else has had to come as a
[1:09:31] baby and a baby is a
[1:09:34] baby so what you're saying is down in
[1:09:37] the age of Martin Luther what did the
[1:09:39] baby look
[1:09:41] like man I don't know didn't look like a
[1:09:43] baby what it look
[1:09:46] like it was a
[1:09:48] baby the new birth in Luther's age was a
[1:09:51] new birth which was the birth of the
[1:09:53] world word
[1:10:00] amen look at to the top one second
[1:10:03] coming 1955 220
[1:10:07] days to me it's every word
[1:10:11] inspired now this is 55
[1:10:15] see and it's only foundation for the
[1:10:19] Christian I believe it's God's word
[1:10:21] words you you see what he's saying the
[1:10:22] only foundation God's word and I know
[1:10:26] what but it's true
[1:10:28] today it's perfect as I'm standing here
[1:10:31] and it's God's infallible Eternal
[1:10:35] everpresent
[1:10:38] Word and
[1:10:42] frankly it's God himself living
[1:10:46] Amen in word
[1:10:51] form isn't that wonderful think of it
[1:10:53] people God himself in word
[1:10:57] form go down to the next one while we at
[1:10:59] it
[1:11:00] 1959 611 which is time of
[1:11:04] decision
[1:11:05] look we're glad that we have the Living
[1:11:10] Word now listen to the
[1:11:13] prophet and the written
[1:11:17] word
[1:11:21] now is any difference in the living word
[1:11:23] and the written
[1:11:25] word now you better read the next part
[1:11:27] of the sentence before you make up your
[1:11:28] mind right and they by record one with
[1:11:32] the
[1:11:35] other the only difference is one of them
[1:11:37] is a live word and the other one is God
[1:11:39] in letter form right right still pretty
[1:11:43] good that lets that makes us rest
[1:11:47] assured that when we read this blessed
[1:11:49] Bible that it's a challenge to us and we
[1:11:53] know the one who wrote it is present
[1:11:56] ever present to make every word true and
[1:11:59] right said to sink that deeply into your
[1:12:03] heart The Living Word and the written
[1:12:06] word is
[1:12:10] God you see if God was ever
[1:12:15] anything he has to always be there
[1:12:18] that's right now it might be that we
[1:12:21] can't make him manifest his that
[1:12:25] that don't change God does
[1:12:29] it there was things down to Luther's age
[1:12:32] and all like that but you better
[1:12:34] remember one
[1:12:36] thing see we think oh this is this and
[1:12:39] this is that and they didn't have this
[1:12:41] that and the other you better check on
[1:12:42] the life of Martin Luther where he had
[1:12:44] all of the gifts right and he spoke in
[1:12:46] tongues and things like that you better
[1:12:48] begin to read a
[1:12:52] little
[1:12:54] you better go back and check on some of
[1:12:55] those people
[1:12:57] right but do you believe him to be
[1:12:59] Jehovah shamama
[1:13:01] amen the Lord is present
[1:13:06] am now if you don't believe him to be
[1:13:09] here present then you don't have the new
[1:13:12] birth
[1:13:14] right could I make that any
[1:13:17] blunder when I brother Dale he was in
[1:13:20] brother
[1:13:21] Brown bless him and if
[1:13:24] if he come
[1:13:25] back brother R said this gift and things
[1:13:28] in my life will not heal you right abely
[1:13:34] amen was that what he
[1:13:37] said he said it only brings the
[1:13:41] acknowledgement or the recognition into
[1:13:43] you as a seeing that God is
[1:13:46] here when you don't believe he's
[1:13:51] here all right
[1:13:55] see I thought i' went to the LI to
[1:13:57] preach on this but I saw it there the
[1:13:59] other day and I said no I'm going to
[1:14:00] change that and I'm going to preach that
[1:14:02] in the next message
[1:14:04] because that's the key to the whole
[1:14:06] thing amen if he's Jehovah
[1:14:10] shama then he's present right that is
[1:14:13] the only way he can be Jehovah Gyra
[1:14:18] right right the only way he be Jehovah
[1:14:21] Gyra is the fact that he is just as
[1:14:24] equal are of the same value as Jehovah
[1:14:27] shamama and Jehovah J is the same amen
[1:14:31] Jehovah RI is the
[1:14:35] same but you see in our mental capacity
[1:14:37] of our
[1:14:39] mind we're the ones that's cutting God
[1:14:41] off now brother around let's see if I
[1:14:43] can remember he said said he's God and
[1:14:45] you don't change he said no I didn't say
[1:14:47] we didn't change
[1:14:51] right he said he don't
[1:14:57] change
[1:14:59] Moses look at the things that has
[1:15:05] happened don't you remember the burning
[1:15:10] bush don't you remember me sending you
[1:15:13] to
[1:15:15] Egypt didn't I tell you that I'd be with
[1:15:20] you did not Jesus come up and say I am
[1:15:23] that I am
[1:15:25] am you said no he didn't say that that
[1:15:27] was in ex I'm glad you're thinking cuz
[1:15:29] see Jesus said before Abraham was I am
[1:15:33] before Moses was before the burning bush
[1:15:37] I am
[1:15:41] right I am was the one that spoke to
[1:15:43] Moses from the burning bush right amen
[1:15:46] that was Jesus in that burning bush not
[1:15:48] as the human element come on but as the
[1:15:51] Christ amen
[1:15:57] I
[1:16:01] am I am means what ever present for
[1:16:07] eternity that's your prophet's
[1:16:11] definition ever present for
[1:16:16] eternity in other words if he ever
[1:16:19] change anywhere that's right anywhere
[1:16:22] coming down true if ever changed he's
[1:16:26] not the same
[1:16:32] right but if he hadn't changed he's
[1:16:34] always present
[1:16:40] amen can't we put then Jehovah shama his
[1:16:49] presence and see that he's here to give
[1:16:52] us the new
[1:16:54] birth and that new birth is his
[1:16:58] presence he said but Brother D I look
[1:17:00] like you don't believe in the second
[1:17:01] coming I preached it for months I
[1:17:04] preached it for
[1:17:08] months anybody out there you go back and
[1:17:10] listen it's on there and call a second
[1:17:15] coming and I believe as I said while ago
[1:17:18] that on the day of Pentecost he began
[1:17:20] his second coming that's right amen
[1:17:24] sir and it'll finish in this end time
[1:17:26] bride with a change of these bodies
[1:17:29] it'll prove that he was here but it'll
[1:17:31] prove
[1:17:33] what was not let me see if I can quote
[1:17:36] it my
[1:17:38] memory this message was to prove now
[1:17:42] this is probably paraphrase but this
[1:17:44] message was to prove that Paul and him
[1:17:46] was
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:50] right you agree right this message is to
[1:17:54] prove that Paul and him was
[1:17:57] right but was it proven Paul to be right
[1:18:01] are proving that the
[1:18:03] Lord is
[1:18:06] right you see but you know what we have
[1:18:09] our troubles
[1:18:18] with Genesis 3 and8 you don't have to
[1:18:21] turn to these I just reading
[1:18:24] talking about Adam and Eve and they
[1:18:26] heard the voice of God Walking In The
[1:18:27] Garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[1:18:29] and his wife hid themselves from the
[1:18:32] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:18:37] trees you know what was the trouble with
[1:18:39] Cain Genesis
[1:18:45] 4:16 and Cain went out from the presence
[1:18:48] of the
[1:18:51] Lord
[1:18:55] Satan's problem Job 1
[1:19:01] and2 so Satan went
[1:19:04] forth from the presence of the Lord he's
[1:19:07] going down to to get on to job
[1:19:15] remember job 2 and 7 it says so
[1:19:19] Satan so went Satan forth from the
[1:19:21] presence of the Lord and smoked job with
[1:19:23] sore balls on the sole of his foot unto
[1:19:27] his
[1:19:28] crown and you think he could have ever
[1:19:30] stood in the presence of God and been
[1:19:32] able to done
[1:19:34] that no no
[1:19:38] right what are we to do acts 3:9 repent
[1:19:42] you therefore and be converted that your
[1:19:44] sins may be blotted out when the time of
[1:19:46] refreshing shall come from the presence
[1:19:49] of the Lord not from Up down to hear
[1:19:53] that's our
[1:19:58] problem really it's what is that saying
[1:20:01] repent therefore and be converted that
[1:20:03] your sins may be blotted out when the
[1:20:05] times of refreshing shall come when we
[1:20:08] realize his presence is here
[1:20:16] right 1 chonicles 16 and 27 Glory and
[1:20:19] Honor are in his presence strength and
[1:20:22] gladness are in his
[1:20:25] place what you need glory honor presence
[1:20:29] strength
[1:20:31] gladness Psalms 16
[1:20:34] and11 thou will show me the path of
[1:20:38] life in thy presence is fullness of joy
[1:20:42] at thy right hand there are Pleasures
[1:20:45] forever
[1:20:49] more but do we realize he's present
[1:20:59] now here is man's concept so let's see
[1:21:04] if it fits here
[1:21:07] anywhere I believe that the devil taught
[1:21:11] a trinity yeah I know that he laughed at
[1:21:14] us and taught three Gods him believing
[1:21:17] in one
[1:21:18] himself but you know
[1:21:21] what I believed he wanted to plan into
[1:21:24] our minds and has done a good
[1:21:28] job that God is off somewhere else
[1:21:32] somewhere or other place or some
[1:21:35] something and that he's not
[1:21:42] here I believe that's the devil's tactic
[1:21:45] that's right to try to get us to think
[1:21:47] God is not
[1:21:51] here you know why
[1:21:58] Cain couldn't stay in the presence of
[1:22:00] God in sin right right so he went out
[1:22:03] from the
[1:22:05] presence
[1:22:09] right
[1:22:11] now to me to you to all of us would we
[1:22:16] do like we do if we knew that we turned
[1:22:18] around and looked at
[1:22:20] Jesus right come on am oh we're all
[1:22:26] pretty good so you know like I said you
[1:22:28] know we we we have you know trou but
[1:22:30] then you know oh you know I I do
[1:22:33] something wrong to brother collie and I
[1:22:35] feel real bad but if I don't go get that
[1:22:37] straight in the hurry it won't be long
[1:22:39] of you blaming brother collie for the
[1:22:41] whole time right now you tell me that
[1:22:43] don't
[1:22:44] work I'm
[1:22:46] sorry I'm too
[1:22:49] old cuz that's the way he works upon my
[1:22:53] mind as well as your
[1:23:00] mind you make you justify
[1:23:05] yourself but how could me and brother
[1:23:07] collie be having any trouble if we
[1:23:09] believe Jesus was in each
[1:23:14] other if he believ Jesus in me and I
[1:23:16] believe Jesus in him how can we have any
[1:23:21] trouble
[1:23:25] come on what what can you
[1:23:28] do no matter what anybody does to you
[1:23:32] how can you justify wrong of doing
[1:23:33] anything back to
[1:23:38] him it's like pH told me one time and
[1:23:41] said yeah but it feels good to get rid
[1:23:42] of that just get rid of that energy
[1:23:45] build up and just bust
[1:23:47] somebody I me a brother told me
[1:23:50] that well I get some makes you feel
[1:23:54] good like them guys at work used to
[1:23:57] they'd hit their hand or do something
[1:23:58] and they'd let out these big old long
[1:23:59] words four letters you know tell them
[1:24:03] did that have
[1:24:04] anyen well it V my
[1:24:07] energy I said yeah if You' have said
[1:24:10] Thank You Lord I didn't break
[1:24:14] it oh Lord
[1:24:19] you see we want to vend our anger
[1:24:24] why because we don't believe he's
[1:24:26] present
[1:24:31] right is that true that's
[1:24:35] right do we look at our brothers and
[1:24:37] sisters as seeing
[1:24:39] Christ come on
[1:24:43] preach butd it's pretty hard sometimes I
[1:24:46] argue with you about it I agree with
[1:24:49] you amen you don't see a preacher get up
[1:24:52] here and light with me listen don't I'm
[1:24:57] human I have my problems just like you
[1:25:00] have your
[1:25:05] problems you don't hear me going around
[1:25:08] holler out how good he two shoes I
[1:25:11] am no I'm a sinner saved by grace right
[1:25:15] and must repent every day and keep
[1:25:17] myself
[1:25:18] straight cry out to God help me Lord
[1:25:23] but you know
[1:25:25] what like I've always tried to tell you
[1:25:27] you read it and see if I'm right the
[1:25:29] children of Israel when time they left
[1:25:30] Egypt until they reached cadis barnea I
[1:25:33] believe they had sinned 10
[1:25:35] times sure they lost a few thousand
[1:25:37] people because of the problem they got
[1:25:41] into but God never did tell him he
[1:25:43] wasn't going to take them to the
[1:25:44] promised land right but when they got to
[1:25:47] Cades
[1:25:48] Baria and would not believe Josh UA and
[1:25:52] Caleb
[1:25:54] report of the land and that they were
[1:25:56] well able to take
[1:25:58] it they sinned a sin that God would not
[1:26:04] override and he said to the Wilderness
[1:26:07] you go and you'll die
[1:26:10] there and remember you better consider a
[1:26:13] lot of things we don't take it like we
[1:26:16] take it lightly Jesus when they said to
[1:26:19] him our fathers ate Mana in the
[1:26:23] Wilderness you know what Jesus
[1:26:25] said and there everyone
[1:26:29] dead now your Prophet said that meant
[1:26:33] they were eternally
[1:26:36] separated yeah but no
[1:26:38] no little
[1:26:40] bit all you want to and they going to
[1:26:42] change God's
[1:26:47] word they going to change God's
[1:26:51] word you think God don't know a little
[1:26:53] Israelite to grow up to be a big
[1:26:57] Israelite and don't you think he'd know
[1:26:59] what he's going to do when he gets old
[1:27:01] enough come
[1:27:03] on but do you believe that God is
[1:27:12] present listen folks if it's not but for
[1:27:15] one
[1:27:16] thing I have to believe it all right not
[1:27:20] just because I saying I have to
[1:27:24] but the word that God has allowed to be
[1:27:28] preached in this little place
[1:27:32] am if you can't see that that is the
[1:27:35] presence of the
[1:27:37] Lord
[1:27:39] then Heaven Help your blindness right
[1:27:46] right it surely ain't been a
[1:27:49] man cuz this old man standing here
[1:27:52] that's preached to you is the first one
[1:27:54] to admit that's got
[1:28:02] problems you said but brother
[1:28:04] Dale you mean you got Pro yes I got
[1:28:07] problems I'm human you know I'm
[1:28:11] human human means going to have
[1:28:17] problems but see I I still like to stay
[1:28:21] in this
[1:28:22] scriptures you think Moses didn't get
[1:28:25] upset at the children of
[1:28:28] Israel you better remember he went up to
[1:28:30] get the Commandments and he come back
[1:28:32] down and found what they was doing and
[1:28:35] you know what he
[1:28:37] done he busted them Ten
[1:28:40] Commandments and but he was ready to
[1:28:43] start ripping
[1:28:49] throats
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:54] but the same man turned around one day
[1:28:56] and said
[1:29:00] Lord if you take them you got to come
[1:29:02] over me
[1:29:06] right cuz I'll Stand
[1:29:11] far you see we're all human
[1:29:16] right but let's let's don't let our
[1:29:19] human parts
[1:29:20] override understanding of God's word to
[1:29:23] recognize
[1:29:26] something if I could see healings and
[1:29:29] signs and wonders I would believe the
[1:29:30] word now you show me that in the Bible I
[1:29:33] want it in the Bible and I want it in
[1:29:34] brother R's
[1:29:36] message no people believe
[1:29:42] that you don't have to see before you
[1:29:45] can believe you going to have to believe
[1:29:47] before you can
[1:29:49] see right amen
[1:29:52] that's all I've been trying to tell
[1:29:55] you we put Jehovah Gyra as a great
[1:29:58] pedestal of
[1:30:01] salvation but we put Jehovah rapi on a
[1:30:04] smaller
[1:30:06] pedestal to say well at times he heals
[1:30:09] me when he wants
[1:30:11] to now there's no such thing in the
[1:30:13] Bible for God to heal you when he wants
[1:30:15] to right I want scripture right because
[1:30:19] he said I am the Lord that Health right
[1:30:25] already he's not going to get up on the
[1:30:27] cross or be beat again to to make a pass
[1:30:30] for us to be able to get
[1:30:35] through and then to sum it up in
[1:30:37] whatever been trying to say
[1:30:40] tonight Jehovah
[1:30:43] shama he's
[1:30:48] present not coming he's here
[1:30:52] your Prophet up until 62 was preaching
[1:30:55] about the coming of the Lord but you get
[1:30:57] in the message after 62 and see what
[1:30:59] he's saying he's talking about him being
[1:31:01] here he seen it and said a lot about it
[1:31:03] back in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s
[1:31:07] so but you know why he could do it
[1:31:09] that's why that you know that there's a
[1:31:11] Doctrine among the people of the message
[1:31:13] that that brother Brandon was so wrong
[1:31:15] and messed up and then the son of man
[1:31:16] come along in the seals and straighten
[1:31:18] them out well now the seals would have
[1:31:20] never broke
[1:31:23] right because he was standing there with
[1:31:25] a foundation is the only way they could
[1:31:27] be broke to
[1:31:31] him the foundation of what he preached
[1:31:33] that's why he said beyond a curtain of
[1:31:36] time well they have to be
[1:31:40] judged he said yes said will Paul and
[1:31:43] them have to be judged said yes they'll
[1:31:45] have to be judged for what to preach
[1:31:48] said will Paul's group make it yeah he
[1:31:51] said then my well too cuz I preached
[1:31:53] just what he preached
[1:31:57] right if he had to preach what Paul
[1:31:59] preached in the seals wouldn't have
[1:32:00] broke
[1:32:02] right but see we want to look at
[1:32:04] something like that the seals brought a
[1:32:06] presence come on folks I'm right I'm
[1:32:08] telling you that's right but don't get
[1:32:10] so tied up in it until you think there's
[1:32:13] nothing until that gets
[1:32:16] here that's the problem is you you're
[1:32:18] saying there's nothing here till the 63
[1:32:20] and then it got here
[1:32:25] right how come your Prophet said in
[1:32:28] probably 50 something he said the
[1:32:30] raptures
[1:32:32] overdue
[1:32:36] right you know why CU we wouldn't ready
[1:32:39] you know why we're here 40 something
[1:32:41] years
[1:32:42] later because we've never
[1:32:46] realized that Jehovah javra and Jehovah
[1:32:50] RFA has to be be the same level of
[1:32:52] almighty God
[1:32:58] Amen cuz you can't put it in a different
[1:33:02] level you can't make one name greater
[1:33:05] than the other cuz how would it come out
[1:33:07] to be the name
[1:33:09] Jesus do you
[1:33:13] understand he's present he's
[1:33:16] here he's he in the new
[1:33:20] birth
[1:33:22] he's never left us that's
[1:33:26] right well brother brother said the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost said go out on the limb now going
[1:33:31] out on the limb does that mean you're
[1:33:34] lost no now come on see you think you
[1:33:38] can quote but just remember you ain't
[1:33:39] going to get by the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost going out on the limb doesn't mean
[1:33:43] you're lost and he's left your soul that
[1:33:45] means you have wh you have yielded
[1:33:48] yourself to the devil and shut off the
[1:33:50] candles and and the things is clogged up
[1:33:52] to where God can't get back to
[1:33:54] you that's right it's not God's
[1:34:01] fault he's never left anybody because
[1:34:04] they done
[1:34:05] wrong he leaves you when you will not
[1:34:10] repent that's why he
[1:34:13] leaves come on
[1:34:16] Brothers take on these
[1:34:20] things
[1:34:25] how can you have
[1:34:29] salvation if he's not the
[1:34:31] same God of Jehovah
[1:34:40] shama what are you thinking
[1:34:42] about so I believe he's the same
[1:34:44] yesterday today and forever but I
[1:34:46] believe we're the
[1:34:50] problem
[1:34:53] that's our
[1:34:57] trouble but you
[1:35:00] see God's going to have a
[1:35:04] people and they're going to realize
[1:35:10] realization and the Rapture is going to
[1:35:13] come cuz he said it
[1:35:18] would he didn't bring the children of
[1:35:20] Israel out of Egypt because they were a
[1:35:22] good group of people right right he
[1:35:24] brought them out cuz he said he
[1:35:29] would he's here today because he said he
[1:35:32] would you ever believe it like that
[1:35:35] right I hope it just one more
[1:35:39] thing I told you about years ago when I
[1:35:42] would be talking to brother mol and I
[1:35:44] wasn't even saved at that time I wasn't
[1:35:45] born again I'd be talking to brother Mo
[1:35:48] come in and I'd be walking up my
[1:35:50] driveway
[1:35:52] and I would feel a presence with me that
[1:35:56] was so
[1:35:57] great until I would actually stop and
[1:36:00] look
[1:36:01] around to try to find the
[1:36:09] presence or you can believe that if you
[1:36:11] want to whatever you want to
[1:36:14] do but I'd look around and I'd try to
[1:36:16] find
[1:36:19] him he has a pure to me and I've seen
[1:36:24] him but you know none of that is based
[1:36:26] on my salvation that's
[1:36:29] right my salvation is a personal
[1:36:31] relationship with Jesus Christ of the
[1:36:34] person of Jesus Christ the revealed word
[1:36:37] Made Alive in my heart that is his
[1:36:45] presence but you see with the things
[1:36:49] that God has shown me and done like that
[1:36:51] even back there most people would count
[1:36:53] all that salvation I
[1:36:58] don't but you see I know what salvation
[1:37:02] is salvation is the person of Jesus
[1:37:06] Christ coming to live in you
[1:37:11] right so Brother D I've never seen it
[1:37:14] like that within pray about let's stand
[1:37:16] what we got
[1:37:19] 69 number 69 anybody have a

[1:44:07] testify of what took place brother Young
[1:44:10] Blood he's a some kind of a engineer or
[1:44:14] something with power company I never
[1:44:16] didn't know for sure but they were
[1:44:19] redoing a big old train Transformer
[1:44:21] thing or working on
[1:44:22] something he said he reached down and he
[1:44:25] pulled a lever you know to cut it off so
[1:44:29] when he did it Ark see that was normal
[1:44:32] you know PR to Arc and so they done
[1:44:36] their work and everything they got ready
[1:44:37] to get everything to go and said this
[1:44:39] thing was built in the 30s I think he
[1:44:41] said now it seem like he's 30 years old
[1:44:44] or something because it was something
[1:44:46] about it a long it was old anyway and uh
[1:44:51] he said when he got ready to turn it
[1:44:52] back on said he was right there and the
[1:44:54] wall was right behind him and said he
[1:44:56] just simply said God don't let this
[1:44:58] thing
[1:45:00] explode cuz you know when they turn back
[1:45:02] on you can do
[1:45:03] it and he said he reached down and
[1:45:05] pulled a lever and
[1:45:08] said nothing didn't
[1:45:11] happen he said there was no Ark there
[1:45:14] was no sign or
[1:45:17] nothing the they spoke about it him two
[1:45:19] or three other guys walked out of the
[1:45:22] room they got out of the room just a
[1:45:24] little piece was standing there talking
