[27:37] gathered here to honor you to thank you
[27:40] for the supreme revelation that you have

[28:36] we ask all these blessings in your
[28:38] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:41] amen in Ephesians chapter one and verse
[28:45] three and Paul is speaking and blessed

[28:52] Christ who hath blessed us with what's
[28:57] the next word say all oh that's a very
[29:01] important word you read between the
[29:04] lines all spiritually didn't hold back
[29:07] anything all spiritual blessings in
[29:10] heavenly places where are we seated now
[29:13] we're seated in heavenly places in
[29:16] Christ according as he hath chosen us in
[29:21] him before the foundation of the world
[29:24] that we should be holy and without blame
[29:28] before him in love having predestinated
[29:30] us unto the adoption of children by
[29:34] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[29:37] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[29:40] of the glory of His grace wherein he
[29:43] hath made us accepted in the beloved in
[29:46] whom we have redemption through his
[29:48] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[29:50] to the riches of His grace wherein he
[29:54] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[29:57] and prudence having made known unto us
[30:00] the mystery this message is the mystery
[30:05] the the whole message is the mystery and
[30:08] he has made known unto us the mystery of
[30:12] his will according to his good pleasure
[30:15] with he hath purposed in himself God
[30:18] bless you you may have your seats I just
[30:24] want to make a couple of comments that I
[30:27] like to share when I wake up in the
[30:30] morning and it's it's a discipline that
[30:34] that I use and you know we fall into
[30:37] patterns and habits hopefully you have a
[30:41] lot of good habits but sometime we fall
[30:43] into habits that are not constructive
[30:45] but one of my habits is when I wake up
[30:48] in the morning I know that I
[30:50] got I've got an enemy around me I know
[30:53] that he would do everything he could to
[30:56] sabotage my plans and I know he's very
[30:59] very well able to step into my life he's
[31:02] able to cause conflict he's able to
[31:05] anoint an individual that I'm going to
[31:08] talk with to cause conflict and and that
[31:10] person you know you may have had a good
[31:12] a good relationship with that person but
[31:14] all of a sudden if he's not a believer
[31:16] one day everything changes and Satan
[31:19] gets into his mind and and in this
[31:22] conflict so I know every day when I wake
[31:24] up there's got to be two deaths
[31:26] I got a die and the devil's got to die
[31:30] he's got to die and we've got to kill
[31:33] him we've got to put him under our feet
[31:35] and you know the Bible says resist the
[31:38] devil and he will flee from you now when
[31:41] I think when I think about that I
[31:43] picture that that I'm up on a porch like
[31:46] this and there is a mad rabid dog down
[31:49] there and he's got his teeth and he's
[31:51] growling and the foams coming down his
[31:54] jowls and and if he could get me if he
[31:57] could latch onto my leg he would love to
[32:00] do real damage to me but I got a bucket
[32:03] of boiling hot scalding water and I just
[32:06] take that water and just dump it down on
[32:08] that dog and what do you think that dogs
[32:10] going to do he's going to run he's going
[32:14] to flee and the Bible says resist the
[32:16] devil and he will flee from you so
[32:18] resisting it's not a passive thing
[32:21] resisting is an aggressive thing you've
[32:24] got to be aggressive with your enemy
[32:27] you've got to let him know that you know
[32:29] that he's defeated you've got to let him
[32:32] know that he is like the old cartoon a
[32:35] snagglepuss the lion got a real good
[32:38] roar he can still roar but he's got no
[32:41] teeth he has no bite any more - a real
[32:45] son or daughter of God he can do
[32:47] everything he can to cause your problems
[32:49] but we know one thing all things work
[32:53] together for good for those that love
[32:55] him and a call together for his purpose
[32:58] so we're going through a trial
[33:00] it's a predestinated trial
[33:03] now if we if we set ourselves up for
[33:06] problems if we I'll you know there's
[33:09] some people I know that are in public
[33:11] office they just love to shoot
[33:13] themselves in the foot and yeah I don't
[33:16] know why you know the last the political
[33:19] season that was going on I had somebody
[33:21] write me an email he says you know I
[33:23] like some of the things that blank blank
[33:25] blank is saying but I wish somebody else
[33:28] were saying them nothing not gonna get
[33:30] into politics I'm not gonna mention any
[33:32] names but that email I like some of the
[33:35] things this guy's saying I just wish
[33:38] somebody else was saying to me hey and
[33:40] so you know that word politics if you
[33:43] take the word politics and you break it
[33:44] down poly pol I poly means many ticks
[33:49] means parasites so politics equals many
[33:52] parasites and and and what it is friends
[33:57] let me tell you if you can if you have
[33:59] spiritual discernment what these people
[34:02] now they you you take well they're a
[34:04] human being that's so and so that's the
[34:06] center of that's a congressman that
[34:08] listen friends if they are not a son or
[34:10] daughter of God they're just puppets for
[34:13] the devil that's just Depp was playing
[34:16] in their minds and Devils pulling their
[34:18] strings making them say things making
[34:20] them do things and they come in conflict
[34:22] with one another you know it be some
[34:26] people are like lawyers they can take
[34:28] either side of the case they could be
[34:30] against you or they can defend you one
[34:32] of the other you won't believe this but
[34:34] there was a town up at International
[34:37] Falls Minnesota and and and it was so
[34:41] cold up there they actually caught a
[34:43] lawyer with his hands in his own pocket
[34:47] the and that's how politicians are you
[34:50] know they don't care if one of their
[34:53] guys says something and he does they'll
[34:55] defend him to the hilt but if somebody
[34:58] else would do the same thing they want
[35:00] to crucify that guy and so you know that
[35:02] war I mean to me it's like comedy you
[35:06] know we have tomorrow's headlines today
[35:08] we know what's going to happen we know
[35:10] about Russia we know about the Vatican
[35:12] we know about the the number of
[35:14] the name the mark the image we know all
[35:16] these things brother Branham said that
[35:19] Russia one day is going to drop a bomb
[35:21] right down the smokestack of the Vatican
[35:24] now when he said that that was
[35:26] impossible they didn't have a bomb they
[35:28] didn't have smart bombs they didn't have
[35:30] computer operated bombs where they could
[35:32] take that bomb and aim that right down
[35:34] the smokestack of the Vatican they
[35:37] didn't have those things but they have
[35:38] them now all these things brother
[35:40] Branham was seeing those things in in
[35:43] prophecy and and and here we are
[35:46] we're living in a day we have to
[35:48] understand grace we have to understand
[35:51] the love of God those of you who are
[35:56] parents especially those of you who are
[35:58] parents of young children you know young
[36:01] children that rambunctious and they run
[36:03] around and they do something and maybe
[36:05] you have to go and you have to correct
[36:06] them but does your love for that child
[36:09] diminish one bit because they they made
[36:13] a mistake or you had to correct them we
[36:16] have to get in our mind we have to see
[36:19] ourselves through the eyes of an
[36:21] all-powerful God an infinite God he
[36:25] looks at us like are his little babies
[36:28] were his little children and if we make
[36:30] a mistake he's a okay don't do that no
[36:33] more and he picks us back up and he puts
[36:35] us back in the race when you read
[36:38] brother branham said something that
[36:40] really shocked me and I had to think
[36:42] about it long and hard and even now my
[36:45] mind kind of spins when I think about it
[36:48] but brother Branham said now not now
[36:50] Jesus being a savior it was necessary
[36:57] for him to predestined
[37:00] a race of people who would fall in order
[37:05] to give himself reason and purpose for
[37:09] being now think about that one God he's
[37:13] a savior and so for him to be able to
[37:16] fully express his attributes of Savior
[37:19] he had to predestinate a race of people
[37:21] who would need a Savior a race of people
[37:24] who would fall I say Lord if you're
[37:27] looking for somebody who needs grace
[37:29] Here I am right here you don't have to
[37:31] look any further Lord God provides for
[37:36] us a safety zone that safety zone is in
[37:41] that holy of holies and and you know
[37:44] sometimes we have to we have to shut off
[37:47] the world shut off the world and get
[37:51] into the prayer closet and even when I
[37:54] first became a Christian I mean when I
[37:56] went into the prayer closet it was like
[37:59] Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie
[38:01] Ernie
[38:01] yep yep yep yep yeah Lord Lord Lord I
[38:03] need I need I need I need and see and I
[38:06] didn't understand how to pray but I
[38:08] finally found out that when you go into
[38:10] the prayer closet get quiet let God
[38:16] create an atmosphere God knows what you
[38:20] need before you got in that prayer
[38:22] closet and God loves to surprise his
[38:25] children God loves us get in that prayer
[38:28] closet and he begins to speak to us
[38:31] about the needs that we have which
[38:33] somehow we don't even have to let him we
[38:36] don't have to open our mouths and the
[38:37] answer already starts flowing there and
[38:40] Lord you're soaked you're so good to me
[38:42] Lord and you know so we talk and even if
[38:46] you do talk and bring your petitions
[38:48] take some time and let God talk back God
[38:54] answers every prayer sometimes he says
[39:00] yes sometimes he says no sometimes he
[39:04] says wait sometimes he says I got a
[39:08] better idea I'm going to adjust this
[39:11] need that you have and I'm gonna make it
[39:13] even better than you ever could have
[39:16] imagined that's the kind of a God we
[39:18] serve brother Branham he was trying to
[39:21] explain
[39:21] the love of God when when he was talking
[39:24] about about John and Mary now if we
[39:29] could really wrap wrap our our minds
[39:32] around this he's talking about Mary
[39:35] she's a good girl and she married a
[39:37] little bit later in life and she married
[39:40] John and John was he was a little bit of
[39:42] a rascal but he got saved and any little
[39:45] good life and after they were married
[39:47] for a while she said she said to him
[39:51] dear I suppose it's kind of hard for you
[39:55] just a new Christian I've been a
[39:57] Christian since a little girl but said
[39:59] for you to a young Christian to have to
[40:02] stand all the wiles and temptations that
[40:04] goes with it
[40:05] after you've sinned for so long let me
[40:09] tell your friends you know I wouldn't
[40:12] want anybody to have to go through what
[40:14] I went through to have the testimony
[40:16] that I I'm glad for the testimony but
[40:19] the greatest testimony is you never had
[40:22] to go out in the world you never had to
[40:24] taste a drink of alcohol
[40:26] you never had to go out on Satan on
[40:28] Satan that's the greatest testimony he
[40:31] said oh my you know I've got to go out
[40:33] and get a testimony I got to go out and
[40:35] taste the world and then I'll get saved
[40:36] and have it no no no you don't friends
[40:39] God will love your testimony your
[40:41] testimony will mean so more if you never
[40:44] tasted the devil's the devil sin so so
[40:48] he says now well it does become a battle
[40:50] and she said I want you to remember one
[40:52] thing that if the enemy does upset you
[40:55] somewhere and you fall and you go back
[40:58] into sin don't stay away from home
[41:04] now could you imagine some modern-day
[41:06] Jezebel telling her husband that she
[41:10] says if you fall if you make a mistake
[41:12] don't stay away I want you to come on
[41:19] home and we're gonna find a way at home
[41:22] this you're gonna find the same wife
[41:24] that you married
[41:25] I'll help you pray back and pray through
[41:27] and get back to God said I don't want
[41:31] you to stay away look I married you upon
[41:33] the basis of what you were but I married
[41:38] you because I loved you and she said no
[41:40] matter listen this this is powerful no
[41:43] matter what you do what no matter what
[41:50] you do I still love you I married you
[41:56] because I love you and the man that day
[42:03] he went to work and he was heard
[42:05] repeating it the place where he was
[42:07] working he said how could a man do
[42:10] anything wrong against something like
[42:13] that when a woman that loves him so much
[42:16] no matter what he did was willing to
[42:21] come back and take him again and try it
[42:24] again see now brother Branham he comes
[42:28] in he said now I think you will agree
[42:30] you have to agree this is as close to a
[42:34] gobble love as you'll ever hear about
[42:36] but brother Branham says now you take
[42:40] take that agape love that Mary had for
[42:43] John whatever you knew come on home
[42:45] brother Branham says now you multiply
[42:49] that by billions and then you have some
[42:56] idea of what the love of God is all
[43:00] about you see Satan he wants to keep us
[43:04] beat up with guilt and shame and
[43:06] condemnation he wants us to you know to
[43:09] go back in the station of creation in
[43:12] our imagination back to those memory
[43:15] banks and he wants to anoint all the
[43:18] things you did all the sins you made and
[43:21] and we're tempted to Oh Lord I'm sorry
[43:22] sorry I did this and he wants us to get
[43:26] into that state but when we come and we
[43:28] try to confess a sin that's already in
[43:31] the Sea of God's forgetfulness God can't
[43:34] remember it God has no record of it
[43:37] god is the only one that can forgive and
[43:40] forget we need to have up-to-date
[43:43] revelation of justification true
[43:46] justification and the bride is the only
[43:50] one that can have the level of
[43:52] justification that we have Luther had a
[43:55] wonderful level of justification but our
[43:58] justification is so much greater so much
[44:01] deeper we understand things that Luther
[44:05] could not understand we understand
[44:07] things that Wesley couldn't understand
[44:09] we understand things that the early
[44:11] Pentecostal fathers couldn't understand
[44:15] brother Branham says now he says the
[44:17] perfect type of our Ephesians today we
[44:20] come out under Luther we went under
[44:22] sanctification and the Methodist came
[44:24] out under the restoration under
[44:26] Pentecost exactly like it was the
[44:29] wilderness journey when God brought us
[44:31] out we did very well but what did we do
[44:34] wanted to be like the rest of them now
[44:36] we find out that grace is the only thing
[44:40] that takes us through you go into a lot
[44:44] of denominational churches and you find
[44:46] the same people every month they walk
[44:48] down the aisle they try to get saved
[44:51] make us make a mistake see they come and
[44:54] they get in the atmosphere anything
[44:56] everything's okay but when they go back
[44:58] out because they're not sealed because
[45:01] they don't have that whole ego they
[45:03] don't have that repellant against sin
[45:05] they don't have the insight to be able
[45:07] to recognize a temptation one guy I
[45:12] wouldn't recommend this but one guy he
[45:15] said you know I can resist everything
[45:20] except temptation
[45:25] and the devil loves those kind of people
[45:28] oh my I mean they're his five-star
[45:32] people you know never met a temptation
[45:34] they didn't like never met a temptation
[45:37] they could overcome but the bride is
[45:39] different the brought your supernatural
[45:41] being friends
[45:43] we're here on a mystical supernatural
[45:46] journey we know we know about there many
[45:49] people even brother Branham when he in
[45:51] his early ministry he didn't know about
[45:53] about beyond the curtain of time he was
[45:56] thinking well you know brother Neville
[45:57] he might be over here might be a little
[45:59] cloud and when you get to heaven you
[46:01] know you kind of float by brother
[46:03] Neville's slope by you know say hello
[46:04] but when he went beyond the curtain of
[46:07] time God took him beyond the curtain of
[46:09] time for you and for me he told us about
[46:12] a world over there he told us about a
[46:15] supernatural civilization a faith
[46:18] civilization that's what we're going to
[46:20] friends everything will work by faith we
[46:23] will be known as we are known what a day
[46:26] you know the one thing that I still
[46:29] brother Sam I can't wrap my mind around
[46:31] this one that throughout all of eternity
[46:35] we will never be bored you never oh I
[46:40] don't know what I'm gonna do today I'm
[46:43] just gonna have a I'm gonna have a
[46:45] mental health day today I'm just gonna
[46:47] I'm gonna call inside got five sick days
[46:50] late up there I'm just gonna call in you
[46:53] know I don't want I don't want to be out
[46:55] there traveling like a thot today I
[46:57] don't want to be out there you know
[46:58] exploring other universes and gala I'm
[47:02] tired I'm bored been there done that
[47:04] scene listen we think we're great
[47:07] because the last 120 years or so man has
[47:09] gone from the horse and buggy days to
[47:12] the astronaut day do you think that's a
[47:14] big thing with God the one who rolled
[47:16] off universes and galaxies and billions
[47:20] of stars he rolled them from his finger
[47:23] do you think he's impressed with what's
[47:26] happened in the last hundred and 20
[47:28] years
[47:28] you think he's impressed that America
[47:31] took a man and shot him in the moon and
[47:33] they say we went to the moon brother
[47:36] branham said they ain't no use going
[47:38] there when you get there not going to
[47:39] find anything and we don't even know if
[47:42] we went there we think we went there but
[47:43] we don't know it's a big great big
[47:45] controversy there the and so so god he's
[47:49] going to continue his kingdom and his
[47:51] revelation and your experience is going
[47:54] to be an ever expanding experience eyes
[47:57] haven't seen ears haven't heard the mind
[48:00] of man has not even begun you we haven't
[48:04] even started to imagine the things that
[48:07] God has for those who love him and a
[48:10] call together for his purpose that's you
[48:13] that's me but we got to accept it we got
[48:19] to confess it brother Branham says that
[48:21] Jesus he's the high priest of your
[48:27] confession sitting at the right hand of
[48:32] majesty and he is waiting to make good
[48:37] any one of the redemptive blessings of
[48:41] the Resurrection sitting there waiting
[48:44] for you to send him into action brother
[48:50] Branham said now if you don't confess it
[48:52] it doesn't do you any good it's a direct
[48:56] quote brother Branham says he can't even
[48:59] go to work on your case until you
[49:03] confess it
[49:04] he said you're it your waste of time if
[49:07] you just hoga and you think Lord you
[49:12] want you to confess it he loves to be
[49:16] reminded of his word he wants
[49:19] supernatural people who are living in a
[49:22] supernatural Kingdom who serve a
[49:24] supernatural God who expects
[49:27] supernatural responses when you give a
[49:29] supernatural request brother Branham
[49:32] says that we have too many other things
[49:34] on our mind besides the Word of God
[49:37] we're numb with the world with all the
[49:42] social media and work and in the world
[49:46] and
[49:47] Bishan and an relationship all these
[49:50] things how much time how much time let's
[49:54] make the main thing the main thing the
[49:57] main thing is eternal life the main
[49:59] thing is our relationship with God
[50:02] I see people they work long and hard
[50:05] building a relationship with a friend
[50:08] but they give go hey God thank you for
[50:11] this day you don't go and right off to
[50:13] sleep they go well little prayer little
[50:18] blessing great prayer great blessings
[50:23] brother Branham says that prayer is the
[50:26] greatest weapon that God has ever put
[50:29] into the hands of a believer and most of
[50:34] us were shooting blanks we got a we got
[50:37] a water pistol yeah well we're not
[50:40] really using we don't know the
[50:42] ammunition we don't know the power we
[50:44] don't know the effect when that prayer
[50:46] goes forth something happens when that
[50:49] prayer goes so if you expect it to
[50:52] happen
[50:53] faith is invisible means of support when
[50:59] you've got faith I was I had that chair
[51:01] the other day and I told brother Sam I
[51:03] wanted to use you know and you know
[51:06] people that they talk about you know
[51:08] about you know well I don't have faith
[51:10] yeah when you walk into a room and
[51:12] somebody says well we'll go ahead sit
[51:14] down and use walk down sit down right
[51:18] but you see if you didn't have
[51:21] unconscious faith in this natural realm
[51:25] when somebody told you to sit down you
[51:28] say well just wait a minute before I sit
[51:30] down on there I gotta check this thing
[51:31] out I got to see I got to make sure this
[51:34] thing sturdy here I gotta make sure you
[51:37] know let me see
[51:38] it's the back solid oh okay well okay
[51:41] then like yes I'll sit down but we don't
[51:44] do that
[51:45] so many things we do unconsciously and
[51:48] God wants us to have unconscious faith
[51:52] automatic faith natural faith spiritual
[51:55] faith supernatural faith I mean how how
[51:59] many times
[52:00] do we have to see what God did through
[52:04] the Ministry of brother branham no we
[52:07] were talking about Paul and all the
[52:08] beatings and whipping everything he went
[52:10] through that he said besides all that
[52:12] the care of all the churches now Paul he
[52:16] had you know the churches the seven
[52:18] churches the seventh Rome currently in
[52:21] Galatians Ephesians but what did brother
[52:24] Branham have brother Branham he had the
[52:28] whole world on his shoulders
[52:31] technology had increased telephone
[52:33] service had increased and people were
[52:37] able to be contacted by the word and he
[52:40] had he here he was he was a humble
[52:42] little man with not very much education
[52:46] and yet the responsibility for taking it
[52:50] and it was just like Paul Paul Paul he
[52:52] had to do a radical supernatural surgery
[52:56] the only known religion at that time was
[52:59] Judaism and that's what Paul came out of
[53:03] and Paul he had to try to take them and
[53:07] turn them from there and oftentimes he
[53:11] was not successful and so God said okay
[53:13] go to the Gentiles go to the ones that
[53:16] have zero zero understanding about God
[53:20] zero experience and you got to take them
[53:23] and you got to walk them right you got
[53:26] to take them through their first steps
[53:27] show them what God is show them how to
[53:30] act show them how to behave and Paul he
[53:33] had to take water what a transformation
[53:36] he had to take these these they were raw
[53:39] heathens pagan knew nothing about God
[53:42] and brother Branham said you know most
[53:46] Christians today they don't know any
[53:49] more about God then a Hottentot knows
[53:52] about Egyptian nights now if you know a
[53:54] lot of people do we have people that
[53:56] were translating the message they want
[53:58] to know what a Hottentot is they have no
[54:00] idea I didn't know what a Hottentot was
[54:03] the first time I heard that did anybody
[54:05] else know what a Hottentot was the first
[54:07] time he heard that word there people
[54:09] over in another country there people who
[54:12] have no education no knowledge
[54:14] and brother branham said the Christians
[54:17] today know no more about God than the
[54:23] Hottentots know about Egyptian nights
[54:27] the people were translating for we had
[54:29] to translate what a Hottentot is then we
[54:32] had to translate Egyptian nights because
[54:34] they had a night and they had stars over
[54:36] there and they had Egypt underneath it
[54:38] you know that's that's how they were
[54:40] translating it an Egyptian night so I
[54:43] mean that's a powerful statement and
[54:45] brother Bram said they know no more
[54:47] about God than a rabbit knows about
[54:49] snowshoes how much do you think a rabbit
[54:51] knows about snowshoes and that's the
[54:54] condition that people are in they think
[54:57] they know their God they think they know
[55:00] that that God's three I said people I
[55:02] said do you really believe you really
[55:05] believe there's an old man like a
[55:06] grandfather kind of figure sitting on
[55:08] the throne and he's got his young son
[55:11] and he said he's here at the right hand
[55:14] and the bird is eternally flapping his
[55:16] wings up here the white dove I said is
[55:19] that is that how you see God well you
[55:21] know I don't know it's a great mystery
[55:23] we won't understand these things that we
[55:25] get to heaven what a lie of the devil
[55:28] friends I'd like to have you take a look
[55:37] at the book of Zechariah in chapter
[55:42] chapter 4
[55:51] chapter four verse one and the angel
[55:55] that talked with me came again and wait
[55:57] me as a man that is wakened out of his
[56:00] sleep and said unto me what sayest thou
[56:02] and I said I have looked and behold the
[56:05] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[56:07] the top of it and his seven lamps
[56:09] thereon and seven pipes of the seven
[56:11] lamps which are upon the top thereof and
[56:13] two olive trees by it one upon the right
[56:16] side of the bowl and the other upon the
[56:18] left side there so I answered and spake
[56:20] to the angel that talked with me saying
[56:22] what are these my lord and the angel
[56:25] that talked with me answered and said
[56:27] unto me knowest not what these be and I
[56:32] said no o my lord I don't have a clue
[56:36] then he answered and spake unto me
[56:38] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[56:41] Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[56:43] power but by my spirit saith the lord of
[56:46] hosts who art Thou O great mountain
[56:48] before zerubabbel
[56:49] now shall become a plain and he shall
[56:51] bring forth the headstone thereof with
[56:54] shoutings crying grace grace we need a
[56:59] double portion of grace in this day and
[57:01] Satan's Eden in the middle of Jezebel
[57:04] religion with the anointed ones at the
[57:07] end times all around us we need a double
[57:10] grace moreover the word of the Lord came
[57:14] unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel
[57:16] aid the foundation of the house his hand
[57:18] shall also finish it and thou shalt know
[57:21] the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you
[57:23] for who had despised they have small
[57:26] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[57:28] see the plummet in the hand of
[57:30] Zerubbabel
[57:30] with those seven they are the eyes of
[57:33] the Lord which run to and fro the whole
[57:35] earth then answered I and said unto Him
[57:37] what are these two olive trees good
[57:41] question what are these two olive trees
[57:43] upon the right side of the candlestick
[57:45] and upon the left side thereof and I
[57:47] answered again and said unto him what be
[57:49] these two olive branches which through
[57:51] the two golden pipes empty the golden
[57:53] oil out of himself and he answered and
[57:55] said knowest thou not what these be and
[57:58] I said no my lord then said he unto me
[58:02] these are the
[58:03] two anointed ones which stand by the
[58:07] Lord of the whole earth now we know that
[58:10] zerubabbel is a type of Christ we know
[58:13] that these two anointed ones that are
[58:15] there we know as Moses and Elijah
[58:18] we know that that the world is coming to
[58:20] the Statue of a perfect man we've come
[58:22] through faith and virtue and knowledge
[58:24] temperance and patience and godliness
[58:26] and brotherly kindness and the capstone
[58:29] of love God's perfect love is coming
[58:32] down to seal each one of us in it's not
[58:35] a corporate experience it's an
[58:38] individual experience you can't you
[58:41] can't rely on brother Sam or brother
[58:43] Wade you can't really it's a personal
[58:45] experience God does not have
[58:47] grandchildren he only has sons and
[58:50] daughters of God now when we look in the
[58:54] when we look in the Bible we look in the
[58:57] Bible and we discover the amazing
[59:01] amazing love and grace that God has had
[59:05] for our brothers and sisters that have
[59:08] run before us which starts right in the
[59:10] garden right in the Garden of Eden and
[59:12] we know that God had grace with Adam and
[59:14] Eve we know God had grace on Noah and
[59:17] his family we know that God had grace on
[59:19] Abraham
[59:20] you know God told Abraham what he was
[59:22] going to do and Abraham way - the way -
[59:24] the way - the way and finally Saracen
[59:26] well Abraham you know I think you ought
[59:28] to do it a different way you know you
[59:30] know I'm all dried up I can't have a
[59:31] baby but you still have seed I'm gonna
[59:33] get my my servant girl you go in there
[59:35] that's how we're gonna have a baby
[59:36] okay so ever that's the way you want it
[59:39] to be I guess we'll do it that way and
[59:41] what do they predict Ishmael
[59:43] oh my you want to talk about it's a seed
[59:46] of discrepancy that was one wrong
[59:49] decision and look at what we have got in
[59:53] the world today
[59:54] look at the mess that we have got look
[59:57] at the mines untamable unregenerate that
[1:00:02] they're against that they're against
[1:00:04] everybody and they will kill you if they
[1:00:10] think is going to fulfill Allah will
[1:00:16] then we look Abraham when Abraham and
[1:00:19] Sarah were walking down and you know
[1:00:22] walking just you know innocent and here
[1:00:24] comes the king's men now they're all old
[1:00:27] man the old woman according to the
[1:00:29] chronological age but this man come and
[1:00:32] he that they're always on the lookout
[1:00:34] for beautiful women for the King and so
[1:00:37] they walk up to Abraham's
[1:00:39] well who who's this lady that you with
[1:00:41] oh that's my sister oh it's your you're
[1:00:47] a blessed man because tomorrow you're
[1:00:50] gonna become the son-in-law the
[1:00:52] brother-in-law to the king and they take
[1:00:56] Sarah start getting her all ready for
[1:00:59] the wedding
[1:00:59] what do you think Abraham was going
[1:01:01] through at that time here's his wife
[1:01:05] taken away from him and he knows that he
[1:01:08] did not he told a half-truth what they
[1:01:11] call a white lie told half truth and so
[1:01:15] now God and here's a bit black he's all
[1:01:18] getting ready you know rub-a-dub-dub one
[1:01:20] king in the tub
[1:01:21] getting all ready for the wedding and
[1:01:23] and so God comes at a bit my leg
[1:01:26] you're as good as a dead man in a bit I
[1:01:29] said Lord what did I do
[1:01:32] he said you got another man's wife
[1:01:35] you're getting ready to marry he said
[1:01:37] Lord you you you know the integrity of
[1:01:39] my heart he had to be a man of integrity
[1:01:42] if he challenged God to by him he said
[1:01:45] that man told me that that was his
[1:01:48] sister he God said I know what he told
[1:01:50] you he said but that man is his that
[1:01:54] that woman is his wife
[1:01:55] now here's what I'm gonna do for your
[1:01:57] Bimala you go and get that man that lied
[1:02:00] to you and you bring him here and ask

[1:02:37] was a Jezebel of a higher proportion and
[1:02:39] so Samson falls in love with her and and
[1:02:43] so everything's fine and then the men

[1:03:03] they wanted him dead and they saw their
[1:03:06] chance that Delilah

[1:03:31] and he whips them sends him on their way
[1:03:33] and she said Oh Samson you don't love me

[1:04:03] he's ready to go give him a whipping
[1:04:04] ain't no power anymore it's gone
[1:04:08] and they take them and they lock him up
[1:04:10] and they put out his eyes and they have
[1:04:12] a great big convention at the Coliseum
[1:04:15] and all the ferret all the Philistines I
[1:04:18] mean they're all there here's the one
[1:04:20] that killed all these thousands of
[1:04:22] Philistines and yet here they got their
[1:04:26] enemy their sworn enemy his eyes plucked
[1:04:29] out wrapped up in Chains they said well
[1:04:32] we got it we got to get some production
[1:04:34] out of him
[1:04:35] and they put him on the the grinding
[1:04:37] wheel here he goes on the grinding wheel
[1:04:40] he wasn't too strong didn't have much
[1:04:41] power he's going around the grinding
[1:04:44] wheel and they are having a hallelujah
[1:04:46] celebration up and in the Philistine
[1:04:49] land and and weeks go by and he starts
[1:04:52] grinding a little bit faster and they
[1:04:54] say hey look he's getting he's getting
[1:04:57] better we're getting more production out
[1:04:58] of that guy and then he goes a little
[1:05:00] bit faster a little bit faster a little
[1:05:02] bit faster and then he reaches back
[1:05:04] whoa oh my my hair is growing back and
[1:05:10] he goes into confession he Lord he said
[1:05:13] Lord just one more just once more Lord
[1:05:19] and he goes there and he has the boy
[1:05:22] take him over to the post and you know
[1:05:26] if that was me if I was the Philistine
[1:05:28] the Philistines captain I would have
[1:05:32] shaved Samson's head five times a day
[1:05:36] he would have been as bald as bulk there
[1:05:40] would not have been a Buddha of a fiber
[1:05:43] ever pop up out of his bald head but he
[1:05:47] got that power by said Lord just once
[1:05:49] more and down come the whole building
[1:05:52] and in death he killed more Philistines
[1:05:56] than he ever did in life now we don't
[1:05:58] want that kind of a testimony friends
[1:06:00] but God shows us how he moved he shows
[1:06:04] us his love look at David and the
[1:06:07] mistakes that David look at King Saul it
[1:06:10] me before I came to the message if
[1:06:12] anybody had ever tried to convince me
[1:06:14] that King Saul was saved Ida said no if
[1:06:19] I was a prosecutor I say okay first of
[1:06:22] all he disobeyed God second of all he
[1:06:26] tries to kill David God's anointed over
[1:06:30] and over has a posse track him down and
[1:06:34] David's got such character he could have
[1:06:36] wiped he could have killed him took his
[1:06:39] coat took his spear you know and and and
[1:06:42] his secure office all your security
[1:06:44] details not too good and so now he goes
[1:06:48] to the which his own law said if anybody
[1:06:51] goes to a witch
[1:06:53] it's death now he goes to the witch and
[1:06:56] he's all wrapped up she doesn't know
[1:06:58] he's the king so he tells her she said I
[1:07:01] don't want to do that there's a law the
[1:07:03] kingdom if anybody does that you go
[1:07:05] ahead do it
[1:07:06] so she does her hocus-pocus and up comes
[1:07:09] the prophet and the Prophet looks down
[1:07:13] says Saul what's going on here why have
[1:07:18] you called me from my rest he says he
[1:07:21] said the Spirit of the Lord has left me
[1:07:26] disobeys God tries to kill David kills
[1:07:29] all the priests for hiding David goes to
[1:07:33] the witch calls up Samuel and then he
[1:07:36] says the Spirit of the Lord has left me
[1:07:38] and I want to know what's going to
[1:07:40] happen Samuel says you and your sons
[1:07:43] will fall in battle and tomorrow you
[1:07:47] will be with me talk about amazing great
[1:07:52] Saul's going to be the choir director of
[1:07:55] The Amazing Grace there I want to shake
[1:07:58] hands that's all you really cut it close
[1:08:01] didn't you buddy but with God there's no
[1:08:04] cut Nicole it's grace it's the sea of
[1:08:07] God's forgetfulness
[1:08:09] and they had to receive that under the
[1:08:12] blood of bulls and goats how much
[1:08:14] greater have we got it under the shed
[1:08:16] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by His
[1:08:20] stripes we were healed physically
[1:08:22] mentally emotionally healed if you
[1:08:28] believe it
[1:08:29] if you confess it if you practice it I
[1:08:33] just give you a little illustration
[1:08:35] there was this guy and he arrived in New
[1:08:38] York City Manhattan he jumps in a
[1:08:41] taxicab and he said quick how do you get
[1:08:45] the Carnegie Hall the cab driver turned
[1:08:48] around he said practice practice
[1:08:52] practice
[1:08:55] how do you become a warrior for Christ
[1:08:58] you practice you believe you confess you
[1:09:02] read you listen you study you pray you
[1:09:06] become a warrior invincible
[1:09:09] indestructible no matter what the devil
[1:09:12] does to you when you've done all the
[1:09:14] stand stand if I stand the devil can't
[1:09:18] make me do anything he can't make me
[1:09:20] raise my hand he can't make me raise he
[1:09:23] can't make me do anything neither can he
[1:09:27] make you do anything if you don't allow
[1:09:30] him to we don't want to be weak in this
[1:09:34] day further Bram said the church ages
[1:09:38] you know they think they're rich
[1:09:40] increased with Goods and have need of
[1:09:45] nothing especially not a message from
[1:09:50] from uneducated a seventh grade guy from
[1:09:55] Kentucky they don't need that I was
[1:09:59] telling brother Sam one of the brothers
[1:10:01] told me that that when brother Branham
[1:10:03] when he had his seven church aid sermons
[1:10:06] that he had preached when he agreed to
[1:10:08] have them translated you know a grammar
[1:10:11] eyes and a bridge input into proper
[1:10:14] English with with the spelling and
[1:10:16] everything he said brother Branham
[1:10:18] agreed to do that to give the
[1:10:22] theologians a chance to see the message
[1:10:26] in other words if that was the first
[1:10:28] thing they got was a church age book
[1:10:30] with no spelling errors no grammatical
[1:10:33] errors make just maybe they might see it
[1:10:36] now they say wow wow this is God and
[1:10:40] then they get into the message and the
[1:10:43] overlooked you know the other things
[1:10:45] that maybe would have stumbled them if
[1:10:47] they hadn't had a church age book to
[1:10:50] start the church age book is like a
[1:10:52] teething ring for a little baby teeth on
[1:10:56] it especially for somebody who thinks
[1:10:59] they know something about God I resemble
[1:11:02] that remark I thought I knew something
[1:11:04] about God didn't know anything and I
[1:11:07] still don't know
[1:11:08] near as much as I want to know and every
[1:11:11] day God reveals something new to me
[1:11:13] out of his word I look I search I have
[1:11:17] message that I've read ten times and the
[1:11:19] eleven time I see how did I miss that
[1:11:23] how did I overlook that one the message
[1:11:27] is fresh manna brother Brandon he talks
[1:11:30] about you know that the Levitical priest
[1:11:32] age and then they had to go there and
[1:11:34] they got big old baskets and they had
[1:11:37] all these Omar's full of the manna and
[1:11:40] it would take that and put that into the
[1:11:42] Holy of Holies and it was only for the
[1:11:45] Levitical priesthood and brother Branham
[1:11:47] said anybody who was going to become you
[1:11:50] know gonna become a priest he would have
[1:11:52] a chance to get a little piece of that
[1:11:55] manner maybe it was hundreds of years
[1:11:58] old
[1:11:58] but they got a chance to eat manna never
[1:12:01] got stale long as it was under the Holy
[1:12:04] of Holies and they got a bite of it
[1:12:07] brother Branham said now we in this age
[1:12:10] you don't have to be eldane Levitical
[1:12:14] for every born-again son or daughter of
[1:12:17] God you have a right you can eat all you
[1:12:21] out of it you can gorge yourself with it
[1:12:25] what a privilege that is friends grace
[1:12:31] grace you know I wonder where I wonder
[1:12:34] where the guys like like old Dwight
[1:12:36] Moody are when when he got the
[1:12:38] revelation of grace he ran outside in
[1:12:40] the first person he said do you know
[1:12:42] grace grace they said grace who Amazing
[1:12:46] Grace how sweet the sound that saved a
[1:12:48] wretch like me
[1:12:50] your brother Brandon said if Saul Paul
[1:12:53] if he was alive today they'd have him in
[1:12:55] jail in a couple of days
[1:12:57] I wonder where's that anointing that was
[1:13:00] on Paul well I said in my mind I would
[1:13:04] love to benefind the wall when he tried
[1:13:06] to convince the Apostles that he was the
[1:13:08] real deal oh hey they were not having
[1:13:13] any of it
[1:13:13] they couldn't they couldn't believe that
[1:13:15] there was that much grace in the world
[1:13:18] but but Paul Paul nobody preached
[1:13:21] race like Paul did you look at how
[1:13:28] wonderful God was to the woman at the
[1:13:33] well you know sometimes we just take
[1:13:36] that in the woman at the well you know
[1:13:38] she's there and Jesus says bring me a
[1:13:40] drink it's not customary you know if you
[1:13:42] knew who you were talking to you'd ask
[1:13:44] him for a drink you know and so then she
[1:13:47] said well you know when Messiah comes we
[1:13:49] know we know he'll do these things he
[1:13:51] said I am he and then said she ran into
[1:13:57] town now she just didn't run into town
[1:14:01] because Jesus told her how many husbands
[1:14:04] she had she said come and see a man who
[1:14:09] told me everything I ever did I wonder
[1:14:14] how long on that conversation was
[1:14:16] brother Sam
[1:14:18] she was convinced when she went out
[1:14:20] there she brother receives like a house
[1:14:23] a house on fire on a windy day I know
[1:14:27] where that anointing is now I wonder
[1:14:30] when we're gonna get unbuckles we got to
[1:14:34] get unbuckled we got to get unbound
[1:14:36] because when that magnet comes by the
[1:14:39] only one is going to pick up are the
[1:14:41] real sons and daughters of God
[1:14:43] everybody else is bolted down they might
[1:14:47] try to get up there they might reach no
[1:14:49] it's not for them it's not their portion
[1:14:52] not their position I love the story of
[1:14:56] the woman the little little harlot woman
[1:14:59] and she went and she got all her money
[1:15:02] that she had made from selling her body
[1:15:04] and she goes into the perfume store and
[1:15:09] the perfume God what do you want she
[1:15:13] said I want the best I want the best
[1:15:16] that you got you just show me your money
[1:15:19] she showed him the money and he probably
[1:15:22] just here get out of here she goes there
[1:15:25] and there Simon and they're using Jesus
[1:15:28] like a like a freak show
[1:15:30] conversation piece everybody who walked
[1:15:33] into that feast they
[1:15:35] got their feet washed everybody except
[1:15:39] for the guest of honor so called and
[1:15:43] this woman goes in there she takes this
[1:15:46] perfume costly perfume and she begins to
[1:15:51] wash his feet with her hair got her hair
[1:15:55] as she's washing his feet with her hair
[1:15:57] if a woman have a modern Jezebel today
[1:16:01] tried to do that she'd have to stand on
[1:16:03] her head to do it she wouldn't do a good
[1:16:06] job either Hey and then the Pharisee
[1:16:10] said oh you see you just walked in huh
[1:16:15] Oh gross if he if he was a man of God he
[1:16:20] he would know what type of person she
[1:16:22] was and Jesus says Simon come here I
[1:16:25] want to talk to you I want to talk to
[1:16:28] you a minute and he really gave him a
[1:16:30] dose of reality
[1:16:31] you know Jesus he was a truth broker he
[1:16:36] was a reality broker he dealt with truth
[1:16:39] in large doses he stripped away all the
[1:16:42] fluff all the veneer all the religious
[1:16:45] coverings and truth was his exclamation
[1:16:48] point he had thus saith the Lord and
[1:16:52] they didn't know who he was even the
[1:16:56] seventy Jesus picked them anointed them
[1:17:00] empower them sent them out they had a
[1:17:04] successful ministry think about this had
[1:17:07] a successful ministry and they come back
[1:17:10] hallelujah happy coming back to report
[1:17:12] the Jesus even the demons are subject to
[1:17:15] us Jesus as well don't rejoice because
[1:17:20] the demons of subject to you rejoice of
[1:17:23] your names on the book of life he said
[1:17:25] unless you drink this blood and eat this
[1:17:27] flesh you have no part with me and
[1:17:31] that's staggered him he Jesus all does
[1:17:34] that stumble yeah that's somebody what
[1:17:37] are you gonna do what are you gonna say
[1:17:39] when you see the Son of Man ascending
[1:17:42] and descending for where he come from
[1:17:44] they said that's it
[1:17:46] are so out of here way they went
[1:17:50] remember called anointed empowered
[1:17:53] successful ministry comeback but the
[1:17:57] random said you can't feed Pentecostal
[1:17:59] babies supernatural food it's too rich
[1:18:03] for them it makes them sick at their
[1:18:06] stomach too rich you know I know some of
[1:18:10] you or you know I'll earn the Land of
[1:18:12] Nod right now I can see you're in the
[1:18:14] Land of Nod
[1:18:15] and right after lunchtime your body just
[1:18:18] you know everything goes to your head
[1:18:21] you know I'm like the cross-eyed
[1:18:24] preacher friends I don't get much
[1:18:27] distance but I sure keep the crowd alert
[1:18:32] that's why I'm not up here that's why
[1:18:34] I'm down here you need something from
[1:18:37] this you need something more than you
[1:18:39] need your sleep yeah you need to be
[1:18:43] energized quickened
[1:18:45] stimulated activated motivated regulated
[1:18:48] you need to be an action for the king
[1:18:52] you know that you you ever see the Jews
[1:18:55] at the Wailing Wall the Jews of the
[1:18:57] Wailing Wall and they're like this is
[1:19:00] just rocking do you know why because to
[1:19:03] a Jew they considered that it would be
[1:19:07] an insult to God if they just stood
[1:19:09] there quiet they said if you're going to
[1:19:12] be communing with God you better be in
[1:19:14] motion you better be active for God I
[1:19:17] went there with a Brotherhood and we
[1:19:20] went down the Wailing Wall and there was
[1:19:22] a little cubbyhole in there and we
[1:19:24] weren't supposed to be there but you
[1:19:26] know what we did we just kept walking
[1:19:27] we just kept walking and most of the
[1:19:30] guys had their eyes closed and their
[1:19:31] rocking like this and the further back
[1:19:33] brother way to further back in that wall
[1:19:35] we got the more they were rocking and we
[1:19:37] got to the end of the thing and it was
[1:19:39] like turbo rock it was it was like that
[1:19:42] they were like the real Pharisees hey
[1:19:47] God wants us to be alert this is the
[1:19:50] midnight hours the this is a home
[1:19:53] stretch of a terminal generation
[1:19:56] the rapture could take place anytime
[1:20:00] California could go anytime that rushing
[1:20:05] could have too much vodka anytime Putin
[1:20:08] now he's going to be the king he'll be
[1:20:11] the king for as far as we know probably
[1:20:13] until the rapture safely elections going
[1:20:16] on - I think he's 24 years gonna be king
[1:20:19] gonna be the leader a Tsar wants to
[1:20:24] bring Russia back to the power that it
[1:20:26] used to be and we know you know this is
[1:20:29] not a fantasy friends
[1:20:32] Russia has got a bomb with America's
[1:20:36] name on it when brother branham saw that
[1:20:40] vision all he saw was smoke in ashes and
[1:20:44] they got a bomb like we talked about for
[1:20:47] the Vatican write down this do you do
[1:20:50] you think that you think that Russia was
[1:20:53] happy when when Reagan and the Pope got
[1:20:56] together you I was there I was there
[1:20:59] with brother Bissell and brother Milko
[1:21:01] in 1991 when that wall was coming down
[1:21:04] the Germans from the West and they II
[1:21:06] crying hugging each other they say that
[1:21:11] that that were Poland they were the
[1:21:13] first ones to stand against the the USSR
[1:21:16] and and and lacroix Lanza that had the
[1:21:20] union movement and he was a strong
[1:21:22] Catholic and the Pope was a strong
[1:21:24] Polish Catholic and he came over there
[1:21:26] and they said that that general Wolinsky
[1:21:29] they said they said you could hear his
[1:21:30] knees knocking when when he was in front
[1:21:33] of the Pope he could hear his knees
[1:21:34] knocking and the Pope just stood there
[1:21:37] you don't think there's a powerful
[1:21:39] presence and an anointing on that man if
[1:21:43] he ever walked in those doors right now
[1:21:45] with all of his regalia all decked out
[1:21:49] and his and his entourage behind them
[1:21:52] and they have the incense going and the
[1:21:54] candles go you don't think there would
[1:21:56] be a presence don't think there would be
[1:21:58] in the north not a holy anointing not a
[1:22:01] holy present but there would be a
[1:22:03] presence when that guy died we had all
[1:22:06] the American presidents they were there
[1:22:09] here's the carcass of the Pope and
[1:22:11] here's the American presidents kneeling
[1:22:13] down praying to the carcass of the Pope
[1:22:17] bushes was there Clinton was there
[1:22:19] Carter was there all there it's all what
[1:22:25] a spiritual atmosphere never felt
[1:22:29] anything like that in my life before you
[1:22:34] know the day that Tony Blair left being
[1:22:36] the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
[1:22:39] the next day he was in Rome being
[1:22:41] baptized by the Pope he couldn't do it
[1:22:44] while he was the prime minister but he
[1:22:47] could not wait till he went back I'm
[1:22:51] sure a lot of you people here you know
[1:22:53] about Newt Gingrich right you've heard

[1:23:07] States ambassador to the Vatican and
[1:23:10] Newt is so proud of that he's got he's
[1:23:14] become a Catholic now I love the history
[1:23:17] I love the culture I love the tradition
[1:23:20] dumb blind miserable wretched poor naked
[1:23:24] and don't know it you know we can get a
[1:23:29] fifteen year old child in this message
[1:23:31] I can't run rings around theologians
[1:23:33] when it comes to the important things
[1:23:35] about the message look at look at Peter
[1:23:40] Peter just closing Peter walk with Jesus
[1:23:45] and he does a lot of how die for Jesus
[1:23:47] says yeah he said well before the
[1:23:51] crows you'll deny me three times
[1:23:55] Peters no way Lord impossible yeah and
[1:24:01] the pressure comes the squeeze you know
[1:24:04] God God is going to cause supernatural
[1:24:08] conditions to squeeze the bride into
[1:24:12] position and they began to squeeze those
[1:24:16] apostles and the biddies and the
[1:24:19] whippings and the cross
[1:24:21] and Peter looking from afar and a little
[1:24:25] girl young lady hey do you wanna you're
[1:24:29] one of his foe no no not me you're
[1:24:31] mistaken
[1:24:33] little Waialae another lady this ya here
[1:24:37] with him
[1:24:38] I know your language it betrays you
[1:24:42] he says no no just somebody who looks
[1:24:44] like me you know everybody's got a twin
[1:24:46] just somebody who looks like and the
[1:24:50] third one comes same thing and he denies
[1:24:53] it the third time and he curses her
[1:24:57] cusses her out for saying that he was a
[1:25:01] disciple of Jesus and the crowed
[1:25:05] and Peter went away after the
[1:25:10] resurrection when Jesus came and told
[1:25:12] him go get my apostles and tell them to
[1:25:15] come and tell Peter to come too Peter
[1:25:20] got a special invitation because when he
[1:25:24] when Simon and cleofus came back from
[1:25:27] the Emmaus Road and said he's a lie we
[1:25:30] seen him he gave us a six-hour sermon on
[1:25:33] reveal prophecy and their words seemed
[1:25:37] to them as idle tales and they believed
[1:25:40] them not and in Jesus comes shows up
[1:25:45] behind us as possible and they were
[1:25:47] terrified and a frightened suppose they
[1:25:51] had seen a ghost and Jesus says why Eve
[1:25:56] why why are you afraid
[1:25:58] why don't what are these thoughts arise
[1:25:59] he's sitting there reading their mind
[1:26:01] why the thoughts arise in your hearts it
[1:26:04] is I here handle me that wouldn't be a
[1:26:08] good idea today we need to handle the
[1:26:11] word you know the word is Jesus Christ
[1:26:14] in written form the word is Jesus Christ
[1:26:17] in a new divine order and only the bride
[1:26:21] can recognize that if you can't
[1:26:25] recognize that friends shake yourself
[1:26:28] talk to your mom talk to your dad talk
[1:26:31] to your husband a wife or somebody tears
[1:26:34] what he said
[1:26:35] true did God come in another form and
[1:26:40] deliver his word to a bride that's going
[1:26:43] to be raptured out of here is that real
[1:26:46] is it true is it true that only 1/100 of
[1:26:51] 1% of the people in the world are gonna
[1:26:53] know that and you think I'm one of them
[1:26:57] we like to sing that song one of them
[1:26:59] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:27:02] them and so when Peter went to the tomb
[1:27:05] he looked in well he's not here but even
[1:27:11] if it is true not gonna do me any good
[1:27:14] he's never gonna want to see my sorry
[1:27:16] face around not after what I did
[1:27:19] denied him three times in the third time
[1:27:21] I even cursed denying that I ever knew
[1:27:25] him and yet he got a special invitation
[1:27:29] Jesus knew who Peter was Jesus knew he
[1:27:33] was going to deliver that sermon at
[1:27:35] Pentecost he saw all those things he
[1:27:39] overlooked the weaknesses to see the
[1:27:42] strength maybe all you can see is your
[1:27:45] weaknesses your frustration your failure
[1:27:48] your disappointments your could maybe
[1:27:51] that's all you can see let the light of
[1:27:53] God shine in France let the word
[1:27:57] illuminate your soul take what brother
[1:28:00] Branham said when you confess your sins
[1:28:03] come to God you are the spotless
[1:28:06] blameless undefiled virgin bride of
[1:28:12] Jesus Christ and you never sinned ever
[1:28:18] because God kept the only one that we
[1:28:21] have to deal with is God and if he can't
[1:28:23] remember your sins what does it matter
[1:28:25] if anybody else can
[1:28:31] so Peter he receives the grace to
[1:28:35] forgiveness how about the thief on the
[1:28:37] cross thief on the cross you know by law
[1:28:41] he deserved what he was getting and both
[1:28:44] of the Bible says both of them on the
[1:28:46] right on the left they're cursing at
[1:28:48] Jesus casting all these these these
[1:28:51] insults in them both of them but then
[1:28:55] the one on the right third pull Lord
[1:29:05] we're getting ready to check out of here
[1:29:07] but remember me when you come into your
[1:29:09] kingdom and Jesus said this day you will
[1:29:14] be with me in paradise
[1:29:17] we already talked about Paul extensively
[1:29:20] you don't think Paul had to do some mind
[1:29:23] battles you don't think the devil come
[1:29:25] and tried to flood his memory with all
[1:29:28] the things he did to those Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] filled men women and children before he
[1:29:34] got converted Saul says he said I'm not
[1:29:38] worthy to even be called an apostle but
[1:29:41] by the grace of God I am what I am oh
[1:29:46] can you say that as we stand I am what I
[1:29:50] am by the grace of God and I'm so
[1:29:53] thankful I am what I am by the grace of
[1:29:57] God oh my you know we could talk a whole
[1:29:59] we could go for days talking about the
[1:30:02] grace of God and the people we could
[1:30:04] talk about the lepers went down there
[1:30:07] down the street and if you're a leper
[1:30:09] and you walk down the street if you saw
[1:30:12] somebody coming you had to scream out
[1:30:14] unclean unclean and whoever was down the
[1:30:20] road they were warned and they got out
[1:30:23] of there quick and then they went to
[1:30:25] Jesus and Jesus he he told them go ahead
[1:30:32] all will be well those 10 of them and
[1:30:34] and as they went as they walked they
[1:30:38] looked at Peter Simon
[1:30:40] what's happened to you I don't know but
[1:30:43] the same things happening to you
[1:30:44] and they rejoiced 10 of them going down
[1:30:47] the road but then one of them one of
[1:30:51] them turned around I gotta go I gotta go
[1:30:55] give thanks I've got to go give praise
[1:30:58] and when he went back and he praise the
[1:31:01] Lord and Jesus would that King
[1:31:04] discernment he says were there not ten
[1:31:08] that were cleansed but where's the nine
[1:31:13] I wonder how many of us that were
[1:31:17] cleanse and we're thankful were cleanse
[1:31:19] we're thankful we're forgiving we're
[1:31:21] thankful we're in the message we're
[1:31:23] thankful we go to spoken word fellowship
[1:31:25] we're thankful we have a good we're
[1:31:27] thankful for all these things but when's
[1:31:30] the last time you ever had a real good
[1:31:32] praise and worship session just you and
[1:31:36] the Lord Jesus Christ all by yourself
[1:31:40] you become a one-man concert to the one
[1:31:43] who sent a supernatural symphony into
[1:31:47] your life with the right beat the right
[1:31:49] rhythm the right harmony everything
[1:31:51] perfect and yet was wrong I guess I'm a
[1:31:54] believer now
[1:31:55] yeah everything's okay just waiting for
[1:31:57] the rapture now friends friends God he
[1:32:01] searched the Bible says that God is a
[1:32:04] rewarder of those who diligently search
[1:32:09] after him we were nobody was ever went
[1:32:13] looking for God God tracked every one of
[1:32:16] his children down but after he tracked
[1:32:18] him down
[1:32:19] he said now now look for me look for me
[1:32:22] and my word look for me by revelation
[1:32:25] look for me in the lives of your
[1:32:27] brothers and say that's the greatest
[1:32:29] revelation friends when you can see
[1:32:31] Jesus Christ all around you walking in
[1:32:35] flesh the imperfect beings that we are
[1:32:39] in the flesh but in God's eyes we're
[1:32:42] already perfect and we're never going to
[1:32:45] be perfect in this flesh on this it
[1:32:47] won't be till we step into that next
[1:32:49] dimension that faster dimension then
[1:32:53] it's all over this power
[1:32:54] it's father Grace is such a wonderful
[1:33:06] gift a wonderful present that you have
[1:33:08] given to us unmerited favor with God not
[1:33:14] one of us ever did anything we were not
[1:33:16] good enough we could not be good enough
[1:33:20] to merit the grace of God in Lord I pray
[1:33:25] that you would take each understanding
[1:33:29] my own included my understanding of
[1:33:31] truly what was accomplished in your life
[1:33:34] what was accomplished at Calvary what
[1:33:38] was accomplished at the resurrection
[1:33:40] what was accomplished at your ascension
[1:33:43] what was accomplished when you sent each
[1:33:46] one of the church age messengers
[1:33:48] including Paul the Prophet messenger
[1:33:50] what was your intent for sending Elijah
[1:33:54] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:33:56] Lord to turn my heart back to the faith
[1:33:59] of my Pentecostal fathers back to the
[1:34:04] same faith that Peter had same faith
[1:34:06] that Paul had same faith that that all
[1:34:09] the Apostles that walk with Jesus had it
[1:34:12] is available France is it easy no we're
