[23:05] I don't mean to change anything but I
[23:07] just wanted to tell you um you
[23:09] know many times you know you pray about
[23:11] things and you try to work things out in
[23:13] your life and you think you've got it
[23:14] all planned out you know and I I had in
[23:16] mind you know with my small business and
[23:18] the job at Keller Williams you know I
[23:21] had this plan that I had exactly what
[23:22] was going to work out and I was the last
[23:24] two months I've been saying Lord just
[23:25] help me work it out do what do I need to
[23:27] do something's got to happen I'm working
[23:30] so many hours something's got to happen
[23:31] well in my mind I hadn't worked out
[23:33] exactly what was going to happen so you
[23:35] know it was going to work out that the
[23:37] business was going to go take off I
[23:38] going to leave Keller Williams is going
[23:39] to be the business and poof there we go
[23:41] you know I'm fine it didn't work that
[23:44] way I lost one of my biggest clients and
[23:47] uh the business has gone way down but
[23:49] guess what the whole thing of the whole
[23:52] prayer was that I had more time for
[23:54] family I don't see my husband much as it
[23:56] is I see him a lot more
[23:59] um you know being there with Rebecca and
[24:00] being at home and doing all that but it
[24:02] wasn't the way I wanted it to happen but
[24:06] you know things just turn around usually
[24:08] it's not the way you think it's going to
[24:09] do you know but I thank the Lord that he
[24:11] does answer prayers and you know takes
[24:14] totally opposite track of what you're
[24:15] planning but that's the way it's
[24:17] supposed to go you know it doesn't
[24:18] matter you know that's the way it's
[24:19] supposed to work and um I just
[24:21] appreciate all he does for us

[31:48] baptisms this afternoon so we've got two
[31:51] now if anybody else want to be baptized
[31:53] we truly want to you to be satisfied
[31:56] about it we uh we don't pull no bones we
[31:59] baptize according to what we believe in
[32:01] the Bible and can prove it in the Bible
[32:03] that nobody was ever baptized Father Son
[32:06] and Holy Ghost until the Catholic Church
[32:08] changed it about 3:25 ad and they kept
[32:12] it that way until the end time and then
[32:15] the word was to be revealed and restored
[32:18] we believe in the baptism in the name of
[32:20] the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why
[32:22] you'll hear me say at the baptism to
[32:24] fulfill what Jesus said to bapt in the
[32:28] name of the father and of the son and of
[32:30] the Holy Ghost I baptize thee my brother
[32:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz
[32:35] that way you can't argue about what I
[32:37] said cuz I tie together all what's in
[32:40] there so that's what we we believe it
[32:42] and we thank God for it all right so
[32:44] let's just you know remember that I'm
[32:47] trying to see if there's anything else I
[32:48] don't remember any Hebrews 8
[32:51] Ecclesiastes 12 dear Lord Jesus author
[32:54] and finisher of our faith our Lord Our
[32:58] Savior Our Redeemer our all in all we

[33:29] sick among us and just have your way we
[33:33] love you in Jesus name
[33:35] amen okay Hebrews 81 we read these same
[33:40] scriptures every time because we want to
[33:42] keep one thought on your mind
[33:44] what now of the things which we have
[33:47] spoken this is the PM in other words all
[33:50] he said for seven
[33:52] chapters he now sums it up in what we
[33:57] have such a high priest that is set on
[33:59] the right hand of the Throne of the
[34:00] Majesty in the heavens okay
[34:09] Ecclesiastes
[34:12] 12 verse 13 let us hear the conclusion
[34:16] of the matter all that Ecclesiastes has
[34:19] said is coming to a
[34:22] conclusion what is that
[34:24] conclusion fear God and keep his
[34:27] commands Commandments for this is the
[34:29] whole duty of man you may be seated the
[34:32] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[34:34] the
[34:39] word
[34:42] now if sister Brenda don't mind I may
[34:45] try to if I leave out some out of what
[34:48] happened you you let me know but uh
[34:51] we'll try to get the point across I
[34:53] asked her to you know sister Kathy was
[34:56] asking her to get up and tell it today
[34:58] something happened and and we want to
[35:00] just make sure you know and give God the
[35:03] glory for everything amen cuz we believe
[35:06] it and if I miss part of it then she can
[35:09] tell you about it but our sister was
[35:11] having a lot of trouble with her back
[35:13] and been praying that the Lord would
[35:15] touch her and and everything and you
[35:18] know to deliver her from the problem she
[35:20] was having and uh so she goes to the
[35:25] chiropractor well there was some way
[35:27] they was two different chiropractors or
[35:29] two different room things and the one
[35:32] that she was to go into she wound up
[35:35] that it was a uh
[35:38] empty you know they were out or
[35:40] something late or something some way and
[35:43] she goes into the room though and
[35:45] there's a man sitting in the room there
[35:48] and you know just one man by himself and
[35:52] the man gets up comes over to her and
[35:54] says you're having back trouble
[35:58] do you mind if I pray for you she said
[36:00] no of course not and I wish you would he
[36:04] prayed for her but she couldn't see the
[36:05] chiropractor right then so she left to
[36:08] go eat I think she was doing and she got
[36:11] over to realize I'm
[36:15] Healed she was totally healed of her
[36:18] problem with her back trouble thank
[36:23] God you send an Angel by to
[36:29] pray for you yeah amen he'll send
[36:31] somebody to pray for you so we thank God
[36:34] that he is on the same all right now
[36:37] what have we been
[36:38] doing taking and try to cover a
[36:42] whole scope of anything you know and
[36:46] that way then you know you can't say
[36:48] well we you leave out this you leave out
[36:50] that whatever and U you know to try to
[36:54] start in the beginning with something I
[36:56] love to do that and then be able to
[36:58] carry it all the way through and like
[37:00] I've always said to you you know uh you
[37:04] people will just say well I got this
[37:06] scripture I got this one I take this
[37:07] I'll take that or whatever they do and
[37:09] that's their business that's not mine
[37:12] I've just never been that way and I've
[37:14] always been to the bases that it's a
[37:17] carnal illustration but if if you see
[37:19] something in
[37:21] Genesis and you don't see the same thing
[37:23] in the Book of Revelation something
[37:25] happened somewhere you you know
[37:27] something changed because that's and you
[37:31] know God doesn't change according to uh
[37:35] um third what is it Malachi 3 I'm God
[37:38] and I change not all right so if you see
[37:41] something in Genesis and you start with
[37:43] one God in Genesis and then you wind up
[37:47] in the Book of Revelations with a
[37:49] trinity or something you you've got a
[37:51] problem see cuz you've gotten away from
[37:54] the truth all right see whatever you
[37:57] start with you must finish with that
[38:00] point but finish with it in the highest
[38:03] order or our portion that it can be you
[38:06] know amen see because it it'll just keep
[38:08] getting greater and greater and greater
[38:10] and greater and greater and that's the
[38:11] way I study the word of God that's the
[38:13] that's just always been my my thought of
[38:15] it I always make the carnal
[38:18] illustration a lot of people start off
[38:20] with a white dog and their Doctrine and
[38:22] Genesis and in the middle of it they get
[38:23] a speckled dog in the end of it they
[38:25] wind up with a black dog and they think
[38:27] man I got it I lined a dog all the way
[38:29] up through the Bible well that's what
[38:30] you done you lined a dog all the way up
[38:32] through the Bible you you didn't have
[38:34] the Bible right cuz it doesn't do that
[38:37] whatever you start with if it's a white
[38:39] dog you better wind up with a white dog
[38:41] not a pale dog or a pink dog or whatever
[38:44] you better wind up with the same thing
[38:47] you know and that way you can know for
[38:49] assurity you know uh of what's going on
[38:53] but I just want to ask you the question
[38:58] and then we'll get into the point of it
[39:01] of what
[39:02] is the new birth now we done this just
[39:06] recently at brother Boyd's at a we were
[39:09] having Bible study and some way another
[39:13] we all pretty well forgot what the topic
[39:15] was supposed to be and one brother had
[39:17] asked for the topic to be there but he
[39:19] was not able to be there that day had to
[39:22] take his mother and Daddy back to the
[39:24] airport so we just got to talking about
[39:26] the new birth you know well brother
[39:29] Joseph said well brother Dale I wish you
[39:30] would sometime just do that where we
[39:33] could we didn't have no tape insistency
[39:34] and he said I wish you'd do that
[39:36] sometime where we could get it on tape
[39:39] you know and everything and we'd have it
[39:42] now I'm not the final Authority I've
[39:44] never claimed to be but I believe that
[39:47] we serve a god that is the final
[39:49] Authority and I believe his word is and
[39:51] as I say in this morning that he has he
[39:54] sent us a prophet in the end time to
[39:56] bring us the message message you know so
[39:58] then we can ask the prophet to answer
[40:02] the things that we have need of and then
[40:05] we don't believe him as I said to be God
[40:07] or anything no he was Immortal just like
[40:10] any of the rest of us needed salvation
[40:13] just like any the rest of it had to be
[40:15] born again just like any of the rest of
[40:16] us had to face God had to have his own
[40:19] Rapture and Faith right all the things
[40:21] it has to be it's not because of you're
[40:23] specially gifted for something those
[40:26] gifts have a problem you
[40:28] know but now what I want to do is just
[40:32] go back though and this is way I like to
[40:34] cover anything you know and you say well
[40:37] now uh and you just go ahead and turn to
[40:40] John 3 and let's read that and we'll
[40:43] we'll get on to the
[40:45] point and uh then you'll see what we're
[40:48] trying to cover
[40:51] but it's always
[40:53] been in
[40:55] man from the beginning
[40:58] to try to find a way of
[41:03] Salvation And you remember we won't turn
[41:05] over to there but you remember over in
[41:07] the book of Acts that they asked the
[41:11] disciples the people that were there
[41:13] that had heard and they said men and
[41:17] Brethren what must we do to be saved
[41:21] it's always been within man's mind and
[41:24] his thinking is some way to be saved the
[41:27] rich young ruler asked Jesus you know as
[41:29] I was bringing out this morning you know
[41:31] what can I do to be saved all right
[41:34] because that's that's the point we want
[41:35] to be saved right that's the you know we
[41:39] want to we want to know that we're saved
[41:41] and and not wait and try to to uh put
[41:44] something on a basis that one of these
[41:46] days down the road uh somebody else
[41:48] going to take care of it for us maybe or
[41:50] something you know I I I believe in
[41:53] everything personal all right but look
[41:55] what happened here this great me man now
[41:58] he is the teacher now you say well verse
[42:01] 10 says he's a teacher but if you look
[42:04] at your little circle if you got a
[42:05] Scofield bible it reference you right
[42:06] back to the middle the original
[42:08] translation says Thou Art the teacher of
[42:12] Israel right that is the original
[42:15] translation see so then you may wonder
[42:19] about that when you're reading it and
[42:20] what we say now to be the teacher of
[42:22] Israel mean he was the greatest of all
[42:25] the teachers yes all of the teachers of
[42:28] Israel was
[42:31] honored to be able to sit down with him
[42:35] and to talk with him you know because he
[42:38] was the top knot teacher all right so he
[42:40] comes to
[42:42] Jesus and watch now verse one there was
[42:45] a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a
[42:47] ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus
[42:49] by night and said unto him Rabbi we know
[42:53] that thou art a teacher now look at his
[42:55] confession we know that thou art a
[42:58] teacher come from
[43:01] God for no man can do these Miracles
[43:04] that thou Hast done except God be with
[43:07] him that's right now that's a great
[43:09] confession right amen and watch when we
[43:11] get to it in a minute about it you say
[43:12] well all I got to do is confess well
[43:15] Nicodemus was doing quite a job
[43:18] confessing that he was a teacher sent
[43:21] from God now the way I like it is you
[43:24] look at the scriptures and it doesn't
[43:26] always jump out on you you know to
[43:29] understand what's taking place but
[43:31] brother random says on 141 of the church
[43:33] age book that Jesus said I am not the
[43:39] teacher I'm not a
[43:42] teacher that's what Jesus said he said
[43:45] but the Holy Ghost will be the teacher
[43:48] right all right so what was Jesus going
[43:50] to tell Nicodemus what he
[43:53] needed right he said I didn't come to be
[43:56] the teacher in other words I had come to
[43:58] explain it to you the Holy Ghost is
[44:00] going to explain it to you cuz that's
[44:02] where it's got to be with all of us so
[44:03] now look what he
[44:05] said Jesus said unto him verily
[44:09] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[44:12] bornn again he cannot see the kingdom of
[44:14] God Nicodemus said unto him how can a
[44:17] man be born when he's old can he enter
[44:20] the second time into his mother's wound
[44:22] and be born in other words can I go back
[44:25] if you say I was born wrong
[44:28] would it change anything if I had
[44:30] another birth you know that some way I
[44:33] could go back into my mother's wom and I
[44:36] could come out
[44:39] again and see Jesus in other words is
[44:41] not written in there but Jesus bling the
[44:42] tell said well you just be twofold you
[44:45] know if you could do that but said that
[44:47] won't work see but he was concerned can
[44:51] he enter the second time into his
[44:52] mother's wom and be born Jesus answered
[44:55] verily verily I say unto thee
[44:58] except a man be born of water and of the
[45:01] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[45:04] of
[45:06] God that which is born of the flesh is
[45:09] flesh and that which is born of the
[45:10] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say
[45:13] unto thee you must be born
[45:16] again now that was the first doctrine of
[45:20] the Lord Jesus Christ as he was
[45:22] beginning his ministry and doing that
[45:25] was his first Doctrine what to speak to
[45:27] Nicodemus and said you must be born
[45:29] again you see Nicodemus was a very smart
[45:32] educated man that knew the Scrolls the
[45:35] scriptures he knew everything about what
[45:38] could be said about the Messiah he knew
[45:40] all of the promises he knew that the
[45:43] Messiah was promised to come out of
[45:47] Judah not to come out of the tribe of
[45:49] Levi when it looked like if he was going
[45:51] to be a high priest or anything he would
[45:53] have had to come from the tribe of
[45:54] levite cuz all of the high priest
[45:57] were chosen from the tribe of Levi right
[46:00] but Jesus was not from the tribe of Levi
[46:02] he was from the tribe of
[46:04] Judah and see Nicodemus could have went
[46:07] through a great hours and and it's not
[46:09] written there I'm sure they were
[46:11] discussing things it was not just a
[46:13] 15minute walk in hey you know Jesus said
[46:18] you must be born again you know God
[46:20] walks in the door you no no there's
[46:21] probably a lot not even written that we
[46:24] we you know we didn't need to know but
[46:26] the text of it the sum of it was that
[46:29] this man finally
[46:30] says now how can I go back into my
[46:33] mother's
[46:34] womb and be born
[46:38] again and see we say cuz we're on this
[46:41] side of
[46:42] that you know looking back to what we
[46:45] think is hindsight you know but we can
[46:48] say all Nicodemus had to do is
[46:52] believe well he must have been a pretty
[46:54] good believer because he
[46:57] did put his whole life on the line
[47:00] right cuz they caught him over there he
[47:02] sure been in trouble right even though
[47:04] he was the chief teacher right you know
[47:07] and he even witnessed as I said a moment
[47:10] ago that we know you're a
[47:13] teacher we know you're sent from God cuz
[47:17] no man can do the things you've done L
[47:21] it be of God pretty good
[47:24] witness so you say well all we got to do
[47:26] is just
[47:28] believe right that's a good
[47:30] point that's a good start yes but he
[47:34] didn't tell
[47:36] Nicodemus Nicodemus said I believe the
[47:38] message of the
[47:41] hour cuz he
[47:44] did he believed the message of the hour
[47:47] he confessed that Jesus was something
[47:50] great he had a pretty good understanding
[47:52] but
[47:53] yet when Jesus said you must be born
[47:56] again he said said I don't understand
[48:00] all right after 2,000 years there's been
[48:02] a lot said
[48:03] about the New
[48:06] Birth a lot said about what happens what
[48:10] takes place you
[48:13] know one group says you do this you're
[48:16] born again another group says you do
[48:19] this another group you know this just
[48:21] just all kind of any kind of a thing
[48:24] that you want to to to uh fit in what
[48:28] you believe you can go find
[48:31] it and there'll be somebody that will
[48:34] tell you if nothing else they'll tell
[48:36] you if you bend over and kiss their toe
[48:38] or ring or
[48:39] something that you'll be
[48:42] saved because there people that believe
[48:44] those things you know because that's so
[48:47] you give so much money to the church you
[48:49] do this that or the other but what is
[48:51] the new
[48:53] birth now first let's approach it from
[48:56] this side
[48:57] why do you need
[49:00] it why do you need to do
[49:05] birth see because you was born
[49:09] wrong that's right because of the sin in
[49:12] the
[49:13] garden every person in the world outside
[49:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:20] that's has needed a new birth that's
[49:23] right that's right whether it would be
[49:25] brother brandom or who it was you would
[49:27] have to have the new birth right right
[49:30] because we were all born in sin the pist
[49:33] says said in sin did my mother conceive
[49:36] me right now those
[49:41] Pharisees those Pharisees
[49:44] they
[49:46] knew the story of the
[49:51] Fall I believe and I've always since I
[49:54] mean you know since I heard the prophet
[49:56] and explain
[49:57] I believe those Pharisees knew what
[49:59] happened in the
[50:00] garden right I mean I believe they knew
[50:04] what that it was a sex act that happened
[50:05] in the garden that he wouldn't eat no
[50:08] apple amen right I believe they did go
[50:12] why would they tell
[50:14] Jesus they said we wern't born a
[50:16] fornication like you
[50:19] right they but our lineage is
[50:23] perfect blessing and they believe that
[50:26] that
[50:27] uh
[50:30] circumcision done away with their
[50:32] serpent Seed doctrine as we'd call are
[50:35] the fact of what happened in the garden
[50:38] they believe that literally took it
[50:41] away all right but see we must be born
[50:45] again because no matter what you think
[50:47] about what happened in the garden you
[50:49] would realize that we we were lost right
[50:53] right see and if if you're lost then you
[50:57] must be born again all right and there
[51:00] was no way in the Old
[51:02] Testament that they could have the new
[51:05] birth right now I didn't say they
[51:08] wouldn't wonderful people I didn't say
[51:10] they wouldn't great things taking
[51:13] place but yet
[51:15] still
[51:17] they needed to be born again
[51:20] right now the first proof that I would
[51:23] go to or the major one I gave you some
[51:26] quotes
[51:27] about some parts of it later but I gave
[51:31] you one that's on the back of your notes
[51:32] that really fits with
[51:35] me is to prove that you must be born
[51:38] again is the fact that in the animal
[51:44] life the animal life that was sacrificed
[51:48] in the place of the people of the Old
[51:52] Testament that animal life had no soul
[51:55] right right
[51:58] right so it could not come back upon the
[52:01] believer
[52:02] right it would cover sin
[52:07] right you know be a capo is the word is
[52:10] used it would cover
[52:13] sin but it would not eradicate right
[52:17] that's why Jesus the Bible says died
[52:20] once far off
[52:24] amen then you say well now I I believe
[52:26] those people back there had the new
[52:28] birth will show me how they got it right
[52:31] exactly am I mean it's just that's just
[52:34] honest how did he get it that's right
[52:37] right well he got it Believing on the
[52:38] Lord
[52:40] now you better back off that a whole lot
[52:43] because the devil believed
[52:46] right now he believed in one God right
[52:50] the Bible says and trembled about about
[52:53] what he believed that's right life to
[52:56] death us taught us a
[52:59] trinity but see what is the new
[53:04] birth he was born
[53:07] wrong there was no way back there that
[53:10] it could be
[53:11] David brother Rand gave you a quote
[53:14] where
[53:15] David he had God's word in his heart
[53:19] right that he wouldn't sin against
[53:22] him but there was no
[53:24] rain you know rain or a i n there was no
[53:28] reign of the spirit of God that could
[53:31] come to David to change his
[53:34] nature right he would go and offer a
[53:38] lamb for what he done
[53:39] wrong but he would go right back out and
[53:42] do the same thing
[53:44] right he go back and sin the same way
[53:48] cuz he had no way to take care of it he
[53:50] had nothing to change his nature amen
[53:53] right his nature was the same right
[53:57] so then down through there now you see
[53:58] God in what he's planning on
[54:02] doing because you can go back in Genesis
[54:05] in the the uh even in the creation of
[54:08] the world like we were talking about the
[54:11] other day there at the Bible study you
[54:13] go back and study the creation of the
[54:15] world and you'll see even in that that
[54:18] God was laying down what he was planning
[54:21] on doing right until he comes out to
[54:24] brings man into his image in his
[54:28] likeness in Genesis 1 but that's not
[54:31] Adam in a physical extent right CU
[54:35] Genesis 2 then Adam has created a human
[54:38] being right and what was in Genesis 1
[54:41] was placed in Genesis 2 right you had a
[54:45] wonderful
[54:47] situation but yet he listened to his
[54:50] wife now what was the difference you say
[54:53] in the eternal life of Adam
[54:57] and what we talk about eternal life by
[54:59] the new
[55:00] birth Adam was by
[55:04] impartation he never had to go through
[55:06] right the stages of justification
[55:10] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[55:12] Ghost to come out to claim a new birth
[55:17] right of course now a lot of people in
[55:18] the message today they don't believe you
[55:21] have to go through them things right
[55:23] it's just
[55:24] believing it's just the new birth is to
[55:27] believe the message you know just accept
[55:29] the
[55:30] message that's evidence ain't it that's
[55:33] not exactly what your Prophet
[55:36] said he said the evidence of the Holy
[55:39] Ghost was whether or not the spirit in
[55:41] you amen agrees with the
[55:46] word if it don't agree with it it
[55:48] doesn't bring a new birth you see you
[55:51] start off with a man in a fallen
[55:54] condition and the best he could do do
[55:57] was be like David as I said this morning
[55:59] with
[56:00] a an honest and a contrite heart in a
[56:03] man that he wanted to do right he didn't
[56:07] want to go out and do those things
[56:09] because for a human being to to be as he
[56:13] is and to be the difference between him
[56:15] and an animal see the animal has no uh
[56:19] Consciousness about him as to be able to
[56:23] you build his house the same way oh I
[56:25] know now they're getting into it yeah
[56:28] they're getting dogs that can talk and
[56:30] birds that can do but it's because
[56:32] somebody trained them it's not because
[56:35] now they're getting a soul because the
[56:37] animal life if there is a human if there
[56:40] is an animal that had a soul that animal
[56:45] would have been found and taken in our
[56:46] place exactly right that's right so he
[56:50] doesn't have that sure he has a
[56:52] Consciousness about him to a degree he
[56:55] has the things about about him that can
[56:56] be uh amazing
[56:59] yes almost looking human and sometimes
[57:03] probably smarter than Some Humans but
[57:07] not always right that's right cuz they
[57:10] can't reason out
[57:11] things they can't figure it out the way
[57:13] that it needs to be done you say well
[57:15] they got them now they'll PA yeah
[57:17] because they've been told you PA four
[57:19] times you get a piece of you get a dog
[57:22] biscuit yeah yeah
[57:27] that's just the way it goes but now
[57:30] listen that animal as I said had no
[57:33] soul so that individual
[57:36] person all he could do was have that
[57:39] believing part of
[57:41] him and God would use those things and
[57:44] man would be in you know he would do
[57:47] great things right there would be a lot
[57:50] of things
[57:51] happened but still it was not the new
[57:54] birth why
[57:57] because they had not been the death of
[58:00] the testator right right according to
[58:04] the scripture now before you can have a
[58:06] new testament you must have the Deb of
[58:09] the testat right amen we are the only
[58:12] people of the world of any religious
[58:16] form that demanded that our God had to
[58:20] die right you think about it right
[58:24] Muslim who you know whatever doesn't
[58:27] matter whatever religion you think of it
[58:30] doesn't demand that
[58:32] their their God die right but our
[58:36] religion
[58:37] demanded because no man could die for
[58:40] the other one that's right there's no
[58:43] way to do it sure we could die protect
[58:46] them from a bullet or something like
[58:48] that but we couldn't save their soul
[58:51] right so then man had to die
[58:56] be
[58:58] covered God would have to wait and would
[59:01] have to come himself amen but I don't
[59:03] believe Jesus was anything other than
[59:06] God Almighty I believe
[59:09] that he wasn't a second person or a
[59:12] third person he was not even the first
[59:15] person because if they was a first
[59:17] person there'd be a possibility of a
[59:19] second person and I'm quoting brother
[59:21] random
[59:23] right see so he was the person yes amen
[59:26] and you say well what happened did God
[59:30] die well you explain it that's right but
[59:33] the rest way for me to explain it was
[59:36] that all mankind was waiting upon and
[59:39] realizing they were Sinners right and
[59:43] waiting for a
[59:44] savior and one day God came himself in
[59:47] human flesh right you said what happened
[59:50] at Calvary then did God die the spirit
[59:55] left the body that's right the soul of
[59:57] that individual left the body because
[59:59] the way I believe in one true and living
[1:00:01] God see Jesus was almighty God he was
[1:00:04] born Lord the Christ according to the
[1:00:07] Bible right which means that what the
[1:00:11] body was the only thing that had
[1:00:12] anything to do with the human element
[1:00:15] right it was a creation right you better
[1:00:19] be careful how you bring that creation
[1:00:21] right go don't pick up a handful of dirt
[1:00:22] out here that's already corroded and
[1:00:24] rotten and St up in the A and let a body
[1:00:27] come out of it that's right no you
[1:00:29] better not do that you better do what
[1:00:30] your Prophet did that he took a message
[1:00:33] called Master peace and he took Abraham
[1:00:35] Isaac Jacob and Joseph and laid a
[1:00:37] foundation and then he took the prophets
[1:00:40] and build a body cuz Hebrews 105 said a
[1:00:42] body thou Hast prepared me and in doing
[1:00:45] that he buildt a body to step into
[1:00:48] right who was that standing on the
[1:00:51] shores of Galilee almighty God Soul and
[1:00:55] Spirit of God God dwelling in a human
[1:00:57] vessel that we call Jesus amen outside
[1:01:00] of that you're trinitarian come on are
[1:01:04] you're in the day where they've got the
[1:01:05] two Lords and you got the doctrine of
[1:01:08] the River Jordan people and what we call
[1:01:10] it that cuz that's just the way they
[1:01:12] believe Jesus wasn't god Till The River
[1:01:15] Jordan well if he wasn't god Till The
[1:01:17] River Jordan he become God then God left
[1:01:20] him who's he where's he at that's all I
[1:01:22] asked where's he at now
[1:01:27] all right that's just as simple I'm just
[1:01:29] I'm
[1:01:30] simple-minded and that's the way I think
[1:01:32] and I talk slow most of the time because
[1:01:34] I am
[1:01:36] slow you I think over what I'm going to
[1:01:39] say bless see where I can speak it and
[1:01:42] then you won't right trap me in my words
[1:01:45] but do you understand what I'm saying
[1:01:47] yes in the Old
[1:01:49] Testament there was no new birth
[1:01:54] right there was no way to be born again
[1:01:57] right if there was why didn't Jesus tell
[1:02:02] Nicodemus why didn't he say Nicodemus
[1:02:04] you're a good
[1:02:05] believer you really stayed with it all
[1:02:07] your life you're born
[1:02:09] again no he told the man that had stayed
[1:02:12] with it a man that had no sin no Mark of
[1:02:15] sin whatsoever connected to him or
[1:02:18] they'd kill him right he told me he said
[1:02:20] you must be born again what would he do
[1:02:23] if he's standing here today he'd say You
[1:02:25] must be born
[1:02:27] again but if you're not born again he
[1:02:29] said you can't understand you can't see
[1:02:33] the kingdom is what Jesus
[1:02:36] said all right so in that Old Testament
[1:02:39] there was no way for salvation to come
[1:02:42] to anyone right and in the New Testament
[1:02:46] you say we're in the New Testament
[1:02:49] now how'd you get in
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:53] blessing that's right I'm asking you a
[1:02:56] simple
[1:02:57] question well 2,000 years ago we started
[1:03:00] a new testament now
[1:03:03] you
[1:03:05] bless you got to have as I said and I'm
[1:03:08] quoting scripture you must have the
[1:03:11] death of the testator right before you
[1:03:14] can have the Testament right so Jesus
[1:03:18] Christ had to die to give his life that
[1:03:21] you and I could receive that life right
[1:03:27] see there's no other way than than
[1:03:28] coming that form because where would it
[1:03:31] come
[1:03:33] from and see he had to make a way for
[1:03:37] you and I to be born
[1:03:39] again he had to die that you and I could
[1:03:42] accept him as our savior and accept his
[1:03:45] life to come into
[1:03:47] us but outside of that we're still lost
[1:03:50] right you say as I said this morning ear
[1:03:53] last night was talking I ask most people
[1:03:55] you know I say okay turn to the first
[1:03:58] book of the New Testament right where's
[1:04:01] people going to
[1:04:02] turn
[1:04:05] Matthew that's not the first book of the
[1:04:07] New
[1:04:11] Testament Jesus was under the
[1:04:15] law he came to redeem them that were
[1:04:18] under the law that's why when he healed
[1:04:20] the people he said go offer the
[1:04:23] sacrifice of Moses
[1:04:27] right that he was still under the law
[1:04:30] the law was in existence until Calvary
[1:04:36] right then you say to me turn to the
[1:04:38] first book of the New Testament I'm
[1:04:39] won't turn automatically to the book of
[1:04:41] act
[1:04:43] right cuz that's where the Holy Ghost
[1:04:46] came but you see he had not been
[1:04:49] crucified let's read a couple of
[1:04:53] scriptures go to John 7
[1:04:57] to just make the
[1:05:00] point but you see I believe you must be
[1:05:03] born again amen and that's not to just
[1:05:05] take a new
[1:05:08] idea that's not to join a church we've
[1:05:11] had all kind of doctrines to talk about
[1:05:13] what you could do to be
[1:05:17] saved but now that you know we've got to
[1:05:20] come to the right
[1:05:22] place right John 7:38
[1:05:30] 37 in the last day that great day of the
[1:05:33] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if a
[1:05:36] man
[1:05:37] thirst let him come unto me and
[1:05:40] drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:05:43] scripture has said out of his belly
[1:05:46] shall flow rivers of Living Water right
[1:05:50] verse 39 but this spake he of the
[1:05:54] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:05:56] should receive right for the Holy Ghost
[1:05:59] was not yet given right because that
[1:06:02] Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:06:06] right right right and see there was
[1:06:09] nobody then could receive eternal
[1:06:13] life until the day of Pentecost right
[1:06:17] there was no possibility of receiving it
[1:06:20] why
[1:06:22] because the testator hadn't died right
[1:06:25] right that's Hebrews 9:1
[1:06:27] 15-6 about the death of the testator so
[1:06:31] when Jesus Christ come and
[1:06:33] died he released his life 120 in the
[1:06:37] upper room receive that same life right
[1:06:40] dire Begins the New Testament
[1:06:44] amen because he was the beginning
[1:06:47] according to Revelations 3:14 Jesus
[1:06:50] Christ was the beginning of the creation
[1:06:52] of God right and on the day of Pentecost
[1:06:55] the creation of God came into being as
[1:06:58] Sons and Daughters right all right
[1:07:02] bringing the new
[1:07:03] birth see then they could receive the
[1:07:05] new birth there at Pentecost then 3,000
[1:07:08] outside then they asked those
[1:07:13] 3,000 men and brother you know that's
[1:07:15] the ones that asked was the 3,00 are the
[1:07:17] people there among them men and brother
[1:07:19] what must we do to be saved said repent
[1:07:21] every one of you be baptized in the name
[1:07:22] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:07:24] sins and you see shall receive the gift
[1:07:26] of the Holy Ghost right for the promis
[1:07:28] is unto you and your children and to
[1:07:30] them that are far off and many as our
[1:07:32] Lord are shall call right so then that
[1:07:35] begun the New
[1:07:37] Testament The Life of Christ amen
[1:07:40] they've argued over and over about Jesus
[1:07:43] when he said the kingdom is within right
[1:07:46] they've argued over whether he meant in
[1:07:49] him or in them or where was it at right
[1:07:53] it was in him right he was the king and
[1:07:56] the kingdom and he had to give his own
[1:07:58] life right where that Soul as I said
[1:08:00] about that animal that couldn't do it
[1:08:03] right right that soul and this
[1:08:05] individual could come back now my soul
[1:08:08] can't come back on you that's right
[1:08:10] right we don't believe it that way no
[1:08:12] amen but his soul came back on the day
[1:08:15] of Pentecost the prophet said in the
[1:08:17] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:19] right H and every person that's ever
[1:08:22] been born again is born again the same
[1:08:26] right now I I know they come up with all
[1:08:30] of this um artificial insemination what
[1:08:35] that big words are uh all of these great
[1:08:38] things that they've done to bring
[1:08:40] children and all and thank God for it
[1:08:43] but still all babies are born the same
[1:08:46] right it takes a mama and a daddy to get
[1:08:52] one and it takes a birth to bring one
[1:08:55] right
[1:08:56] they haven't figured out yet how they
[1:08:57] can take the egg and the sperm and put
[1:09:00] it over in a tube and bring a
[1:09:03] baby they have to put it in a mother
[1:09:06] right right cuz it won't it won't
[1:09:09] produce over there right it's got to
[1:09:11] have some other way all right but now
[1:09:15] see I believe all new birs are the
[1:09:18] same right but now brother Dale I spoke
[1:09:21] in tongues and maybe brother dick cried
[1:09:23] and maybe sister Gail harded Hallelujah
[1:09:25] maybe Aaron screamed maybe this happened
[1:09:28] or that happened I didn't ask you what
[1:09:30] happened right I ain't talking about
[1:09:33] what
[1:09:34] happened what happened is according to
[1:09:37] your nature right brother randam even
[1:09:40] said one day he said if you're born
[1:09:42] again under an emotional atmosphere
[1:09:44] you'll be
[1:09:45] emotional he said if you're born again
[1:09:47] under more of a milder atmosphere he
[1:09:49] said you'll be a milder
[1:09:52] atmosphere because it's R but all birth
[1:09:54] is the same
[1:09:56] right all natural births are the same
[1:10:01] right see all spiritual
[1:10:04] verse yeah but this one group believe
[1:10:06] this one group believe that one I didn't
[1:10:08] say nothing about
[1:10:11] that you said I shouted I spoke in
[1:10:14] tongue all babies
[1:10:18] cry right right but the baby crying is
[1:10:23] not to birth
[1:10:26] right the baby crying is after the birth
[1:10:30] right see you're talking about the same
[1:10:32] thing I was this morning that drinking
[1:10:35] gambling smoking running around is not
[1:10:37] sin it's an attribute of unbelief you do
[1:10:39] them because you're an unbeliever you
[1:10:42] cry speak in tongue shout Glory
[1:10:44] Hallelujah See Vision why because you're
[1:10:46] a human being born into a real to where
[1:10:49] God can deal with you come on
[1:10:51] brother so get away from this the well I
[1:10:55] I got the evidence cuz I believe the
[1:10:57] message that has been the evidence in
[1:10:59] every age that's right amen right right
[1:11:03] every age the new birth was the same and
[1:11:05] every age the the proof was the same to
[1:11:09] believe the message of the
[1:11:12] age so don't go around and say well now
[1:11:15] they had one here and they had one here
[1:11:17] and we got this here and like I told you
[1:11:19] about in the water baptism people in
[1:11:22] this message has said we take acts 23
[1:11:25] for our baptism but the denominations
[1:11:27] take Matthew 28:19 now I differ with you
[1:11:30] totally that's impossible that's
[1:11:32] incorrect if the denominations would
[1:11:34] take Matthew 28:19 and get baptized in
[1:11:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:41] right that would be the thing was it's
[1:11:43] all the same am see do you understand
[1:11:45] what I'm trying to make a point yes but
[1:11:48] you see I know what them brains are
[1:11:50] sitting there looking at me you know why
[1:11:53] cuz if I was out there I'd be looking at
[1:11:54] me too
[1:11:56] you know what their brains is doing
[1:11:58] they're sitting there thinking but he
[1:12:00] don't
[1:12:01] understand I spoke in tongues when I was
[1:12:03] born again and so and so he done so and
[1:12:05] so when he's born again you didn't
[1:12:07] listen that's right wake up right right
[1:12:11] right the baby cries after it gets in
[1:12:14] the world right the new birth is a
[1:12:18] birth get the birth right right then
[1:12:22] start talking about what's going to take
[1:12:24] place right
[1:12:27] you I mean this it's amazing I was
[1:12:30] reading the other day even to show you
[1:12:31] how animals will do if you heard this
[1:12:33] one that just recently happened where
[1:12:35] this
[1:12:36] uh little uh donkey uh zebra it's half
[1:12:42] zebra and half
[1:12:43] donkey was just
[1:12:45] born and you know parts of it looks like
[1:12:48] a donkey parts of it looks like a
[1:12:50] zebra and it's so amazing until a donkey
[1:12:54] itself just lays flat down when it falls
[1:12:56] down goes to sleep a zebra lays down
[1:12:59] with his legs to where can watch cuz he
[1:13:02] scared right and you know the little
[1:13:04] baby lays like a
[1:13:06] zebra looks like a
[1:13:11] donkey sure we in all kind of things
[1:13:13] like that but that don't change
[1:13:17] nothing it took a a sperm and a egg to
[1:13:22] bring whatever was brought that's right
[1:13:25] right right and see that's the way it is
[1:13:27] in the new birth amen right all right
[1:13:30] now do you understand what I believe
[1:13:31] whether you believe it or not I believe
[1:13:34] the new birth is the same for everybody
[1:13:39] amen whatever age you in it's the same y
[1:13:43] amen the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:13:45] the day of Pentecost is the same holy
[1:13:47] ghost that gives you the new birth
[1:13:50] today now you show me some other way
[1:13:52] that's
[1:13:53] not right
[1:13:55] it's got to be that new birth all right
[1:13:57] if it's that new birth then every Born
[1:14:00] Again believer has the same New Birth
[1:14:04] just as every natural baby has the same
[1:14:07] natural birth right now I know they
[1:14:09] going into the cians and I just but I
[1:14:11] said natural birth amen okay right all
[1:14:16] natural births are
[1:14:19] natural but now listen so Jesus said to
[1:14:22] Nicodemus
[1:14:25] well Nicodemus all you got to do is
[1:14:26] believe the message
[1:14:30] oh all you got to do is shout speaking
[1:14:33] tongues and and Nicodemus would have
[1:14:35] looked at him and said we've been
[1:14:38] through all of that stuff right that
[1:14:40] wouldn't what I ask you right I asked
[1:14:44] you what are you talking about you said
[1:14:47] I need to be born again I want to know
[1:14:49] what you mean
[1:14:52] right I said okay I'll explain what what
[1:14:55] I mean you got to be born again right
[1:14:58] and if you'll look in original
[1:15:00] translation the original translation
[1:15:03] says You must be born from
[1:15:10] above where was Jesus born
[1:15:13] from am come on where did Jesus get his
[1:15:16] natural birth
[1:15:19] from sure wasn't Joseph and Mary
[1:15:26] right and it sure wasn't Mary and the
[1:15:28] Holy Ghost got
[1:15:30] together right cuz that's what the
[1:15:33] denominations think they think Mary
[1:15:35] produced The Egg and God produced the
[1:15:38] sperm to put it in there and that would
[1:15:40] make mankind being sinful because it
[1:15:42] would be coming from Eve that was
[1:15:44] sinful so it's not God created egg and
[1:15:47] sperm
[1:15:48] both and brought a natural birth into
[1:15:50] being and that was the birth of the word
[1:15:53] right right because I thought my Bible
[1:15:55] we read it says in the beginning was the
[1:15:57] word word was with God and the Word was
[1:15:58] God and then we jump over and quot quote
[1:16:01] verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and
[1:16:03] dwelt among us we beheld it as only
[1:16:05] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:16:06] truth amen I thought we believe that his
[1:16:09] birth was the worth of the word right
[1:16:12] right I thought we believe like the
[1:16:14] prophet spoken words re the seed he said
[1:16:16] there was 120 Little Seeds laying in
[1:16:19] that upper room waiting on the Holy
[1:16:21] Ghost to fall right
[1:16:26] but you say but what about those in the
[1:16:28] life of Jesus that accepted him and the
[1:16:31] Bible even says and they believed on him
[1:16:34] right that's
[1:16:37] true you can believe on him too and
[1:16:40] never be saved that's
[1:16:43] right you said but all I got to do is
[1:16:46] accept him but when did he accept you
[1:16:48] now I'm quoting brother brandham now
[1:16:50] right okay amen when did he accept you
[1:16:54] you know those disciples walked with
[1:16:56] Jesus for three and 1/2 years
[1:16:59] right heard him preach all these
[1:17:02] doctrines and right at the last they
[1:17:04] wound up
[1:17:07] saying you know we're about a halfway
[1:17:09] getting to where we can understand what
[1:17:10] you're talking
[1:17:11] about he said now do you finally believe
[1:17:15] well you know that didn't make them
[1:17:18] saved that's right they still had to go
[1:17:21] to the upper room amen right
[1:17:25] like the the brother R said about the
[1:17:26] Catholics we don't thr off on them but
[1:17:28] you know
[1:17:30] Mary the one they Glory so much in she
[1:17:32] had to go to the upper room to receive
[1:17:34] the new birth
[1:17:36] right didn't set her aside just because
[1:17:38] she bed the body and didn't have
[1:17:40] anything to do with
[1:17:42] it but you see
[1:17:44] then what we're trying to get to
[1:17:46] Nicodemus he couldn't
[1:17:49] comprehend Nicodemus all you got to do
[1:17:51] is
[1:17:53] believe you know just
[1:17:56] believe well he's doing a whole lot more
[1:17:58] than we do
[1:18:02] believing and you say well I've accepted
[1:18:04] him as my savior but has he accepted
[1:18:09] you you say what but now brother D all
[1:18:12] Abraham could do was
[1:18:16] believe Abraham believed it was counted
[1:18:18] done to him for righteousness I'll agree
[1:18:21] with you but what God do to Abraham
[1:18:25] God gave Abraham the sign of
[1:18:28] circumcision right
[1:18:31] right he gave him that as a sign he had
[1:18:33] accepted him has God given you anything
[1:18:37] to show on that you've been accepted
[1:18:40] right well I I don't know what the new
[1:18:42] birth
[1:18:43] is well read what your Prophet said it
[1:18:49] is and it should be enough to what we've
[1:18:51] already preached but let's just read a
[1:18:53] little bit I gave you these today I
[1:18:55] don't you give I give notes every once
[1:18:57] in a while but I give you these I for a
[1:19:00] message called inspir spiritual
[1:19:02] inspiration U paragraph which is e
[1:19:05] 4956
[1:19:08] 128 see a Fell's coming around he
[1:19:10] saiding I do this and I do that I don't
[1:19:11] do this and I don't do these things well
[1:19:13] I go to church sure I believe in God I
[1:19:15] believe Jesus is the son of God now
[1:19:17] listen to it every devil in hell
[1:19:20] believes the same thing
[1:19:26] as I said the devil believed in one God
[1:19:28] and trembled about it taught us a
[1:19:31] trinity and laughed like everything at
[1:19:32] us made fun of
[1:19:34] it he knows there's just one God like we
[1:19:38] talking about last
[1:19:40] night he could handle every one of those
[1:19:43] angels CU Daniel go to the Book of
[1:19:46] Daniel and you'll find that Daniel was
[1:19:48] hindered 21 days that he could not
[1:19:52] come Gabriel was hindered 21 days he
[1:19:55] couldn't come to Daniel right he said
[1:19:57] until your prince came
[1:20:00] Michael so Michael come in took over and
[1:20:02] says you go ahead I'll take care of this
[1:20:05] old boy you know why cuz he cast that
[1:20:07] old boy out of heaven in the
[1:20:09] beginning Satan never could understand
[1:20:11] about
[1:20:14] Michael right right like I was telling
[1:20:16] him last night here stands God and and
[1:20:19] the devil is the anointed sherub that
[1:20:21] stands beside the Lord in his creation
[1:20:25] and he looks down and he sees Gabriel
[1:20:27] and wormwood this one and that one and
[1:20:29] that one and all
[1:20:31] he I'm number
[1:20:35] one and all at once a little Halo of
[1:20:37] light just goes out like that
[1:20:41] right and he begins to say Let There
[1:20:44] Be and that was Christ which was Michael
[1:20:48] and Satan never did understand that but
[1:20:51] you know
[1:20:52] what he knew one thing for certain
[1:20:55] that was the guy that Dred him out of
[1:20:56] heaven
[1:20:58] right but he's been trying all the time
[1:21:00] to get enough force and power I told him
[1:21:02] last night you ought not let your kids
[1:21:04] watch these movies of what's called
[1:21:06] Mortal Combat and stuff like that
[1:21:09] because they believe in that they made
[1:21:11] it look so real until they believe that
[1:21:13] if I like if I was battling Aaron that
[1:21:16] if I kill him his soul comes to me and
[1:21:19] gives me more power oh
[1:21:21] my see that's what the devil thinks
[1:21:24] devil thinks that the more power he gets
[1:21:28] by getting people the more people he
[1:21:29] gets and the life thing they for all
[1:21:32] idiot does is wind up in the
[1:21:35] resurrection trying to draw everybody
[1:21:38] back up there to help him
[1:21:40] fight it ain't going to take but one man
[1:21:43] to get rid of
[1:21:45] him and that's Christ amen that's the
[1:21:48] guy okay let me get out of that all
[1:21:50] right every devil in hell believes the
[1:21:53] same thing
[1:21:55] that's right I wish you people come to
[1:21:57] church as much as the devil
[1:22:01] does that hurts don't
[1:22:08] it he never misses that's right that's
[1:22:12] right that's right watch every devil in
[1:22:15] hell believes the same thing now you
[1:22:18] talking about the devil's in hell they
[1:22:20] publicly confess it
[1:22:24] come

[1:23:40] again y God willing he said I want to
[1:23:43] preach on that because it's
[1:23:44] materializing in my heart brother randam
[1:23:47] what is the new birth okay let's read it
[1:23:50] 1963 728 which is Christ The Mystery of
[1:23:53] God revealed
[1:23:55] look Christ in you makes him the center
[1:23:56] of the life of the Revelation right look
[1:23:59] what it does Christ in you makes you the
[1:24:01] center of the life of the Revelation see
[1:24:04] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:24:05] center of the Revelation Christ in the
[1:24:07] Bible makes the Bible a complete
[1:24:09] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[1:24:12] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:24:14] thing right see what God's trying to do
[1:24:19] what is the new birth then you say well
[1:24:21] brother brandom what is the new birth
[1:24:24] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:24:26] personally to you
[1:24:31] right and what see not you joined a
[1:24:34] church you shook a hand you done
[1:24:36] something different you set a Creed you
[1:24:38] promised to live by code of rules but
[1:24:40] Christ the Bible he is the word that was
[1:24:43] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:24:46] anybody says what takes place is Christ
[1:24:50] Pastor priest whatever it might be is
[1:24:52] Christ in you then is a the Revelation
[1:24:55] that the church was built upon is that
[1:24:58] what Jesus and Matthew was right you
[1:25:01] know was talking I mean there in in
[1:25:03] Peter and Matthew right th art the
[1:25:05] Christ the son of the Living God what is
[1:25:07] the new birth brother R it's revelation
[1:25:09] of Jesus Christ personally to you now
[1:25:12] where's he talking about all these
[1:25:13] shouting and crying and everything
[1:25:14] everybody says and proof of the message
[1:25:17] or whatever where where is all of
[1:25:20] that brother R say it's revelation of
[1:25:22] Jesus Christ
[1:25:25] right now he said a revelation of Jesus
[1:25:27] Christ so we're going to read a little
[1:25:28] bit more about that but he said the
[1:25:30] Revelation you say well now if it's that
[1:25:32] way Brother D I just read my way into
[1:25:36] it it's got to be revealed amen you can
[1:25:40] memorize every scripture in the Bible
[1:25:43] and that don't mean you're saved that
[1:25:44] means you got a good
[1:25:46] memory but you can have a revelation of
[1:25:49] one thing and be saved it's in the same
[1:25:52] message I think it's page 4 five Christ
[1:25:54] my God revealed I believe that's right
[1:25:57] where he said it's Jesus Christ revealed
[1:25:59] in the most illiterate person amen
[1:26:05] right
[1:26:07] oh so it sure ain't no education is
[1:26:11] it in the most illiterate person brother
[1:26:14] Dale you mean you believe in the
[1:26:16] illiterate person can be saved yes and
[1:26:18] so ises your Prophet cuz he said it amen
[1:26:21] I believe God can make himself simple
[1:26:23] enough until can save the most
[1:26:26] illiterate cuz Hey folks you don't know
[1:26:29] what's going on in that little mind you
[1:26:31] know yourself there's a lot of
[1:26:33] intelligent people that cannot even
[1:26:35] speak or say anything right but they're
[1:26:38] very very super intelligent that's right
[1:26:42] but he said the most illiterate person
[1:26:43] could be saved
[1:26:47] amen cuz all they got to do except Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ and watch going down to the next
[1:26:52] one PMA Vision that be 60 1204 the
[1:26:55] evening service paragraph
[1:26:58] 71 now ask God while we're talking on
[1:27:01] Revelations because he was in The Book
[1:27:02] of Revelation ask him to give you a
[1:27:05] revelation of
[1:27:07] this for it can only be known by
[1:27:11] Revelation now remember no man can call
[1:27:15] Jesus the Christ except it be by the
[1:27:16] Holy Ghost that's exactly right no man
[1:27:18] can call Jesus Christ except it be by
[1:27:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Butz
[1:27:22] other than that you're saying what
[1:27:23] somebody else say
[1:27:25] yes so now what do we say it for it can
[1:27:28] only be known by Revelation and you can
[1:27:30] only be saved by
[1:27:34] Revelation right I don't need no
[1:27:36] Revelation well you can't be saved then
[1:27:40] right cuz watch he's using the scripture
[1:27:42] but you can't be saved until it's
[1:27:44] revealed to
[1:27:45] you and we'll let me go back you can
[1:27:47] only be saved by Revelation you have a
[1:27:49] knowledge of it intellectually but you
[1:27:52] can't be saved until it's revealed to
[1:27:53] you no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:27:56] only by the Holy Ghost that's what the
[1:27:58] Bible says no man can say Jesus is
[1:28:00] Christ until he has received the Holy
[1:28:02] Ghost he might say the Pastor said so
[1:28:06] the Bible said so them are true the
[1:28:08] church said so that is true but you
[1:28:10] don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost
[1:28:12] has revealed it to you and he's become
[1:28:14] in you no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:28:17] only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge
[1:28:19] not by
[1:28:21] intellectual the next one what does he
[1:28:23] say he says you cannot be saved without
[1:28:26] faith that's in the message perfect
[1:28:29] Faith 1963 8:25 you can't be saved
[1:28:32] without a revelation you can't be saved
[1:28:34] without
[1:28:35] faith the Bible said he that cometh to
[1:28:38] God must believe that he is and a
[1:28:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:28:41] him all right so the only way you can be
[1:28:44] saved is by
[1:28:46] Revelation for God to speak to you and
[1:28:49] tell you that you're
[1:28:51] saved it's not what somebody else tells
[1:28:53] you right
[1:28:56] I've heard people say when brother
[1:28:57] randam comes back one of these days
[1:28:59] Under the Tent I'll get under that tent
[1:29:01] and he'll tell me I got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] well that's all right if you got
[1:29:06] it but if you ain't got it where you
[1:29:08] going to get
[1:29:12] it you know I mean if it took you all
[1:29:14] these years you ain't got it
[1:29:16] yet is he going to do a magic trick and
[1:29:19] give it to
[1:29:20] you
[1:29:23] no see the new birth is the revealed
[1:29:27] word that's the whole thing of the Book
[1:29:30] of Matthew Mark Luke and John I wish you
[1:29:32] would read that over over over and over
[1:29:37] and see how that the seed that the so
[1:29:39] was to sow the so was the son of man
[1:29:42] which was the Lord Jesus Christ he s De
[1:29:45] seed into that 120 or into more right
[1:29:51] because there was over three over 500
[1:29:53] brethen see him after his resurrection
[1:29:56] but only 120 held on right so if you'll
[1:29:59] notice he gets in there and says about
[1:30:02] The Parables the soord went forth to S
[1:30:05] it fell on Stony ground fell on this
[1:30:07] fell on but one of them says they took
[1:30:08] the word and held
[1:30:10] it what was the difference in the 120 in
[1:30:12] the upper room and the 500 that saw
[1:30:15] Jesus after his resurrection the Bible
[1:30:18] says 500 right Brethren saw him after
[1:30:21] his resurrect where was the other 380
[1:30:25] y right they didn't believe it
[1:30:29] right well now brother Dale don't make
[1:30:31] it so bad probably Joe had to go to a
[1:30:35] funeral well let's get into The Parables
[1:30:38] then one says I married a wife have me
[1:30:41] excuse mother said I've done
[1:30:44] this I bought some cows and I got to go
[1:30:46] look at them don't be silly about
[1:30:50] it they didn't make it to the upper room
[1:30:54] the most important thing that could have
[1:30:57] ever happened in a human mortal right
[1:31:00] but till some way got into that upper
[1:31:03] room right and waited on the Holy Ghost
[1:31:05] to follow
[1:31:06] right but yet they didn't count it
[1:31:09] worthy right that's why I said read
[1:31:12] Matthew Mark Luke and John you'll see
[1:31:14] the story all the way through there
[1:31:15] shows you they never got to a really
[1:31:18] believ in condition seeing the sick heal
[1:31:20] the dead raise all kind of things
[1:31:22] happening the same thing said
[1:31:25] but yet they never did get
[1:31:26] saved right only that 120 now some of
[1:31:30] the others could come on later I come on
[1:31:34] right but listen what is the new birth
[1:31:37] brother random it's the revelation of
[1:31:39] Jesus Christ personally you
[1:31:42] right well brother D I believe the
[1:31:44] message well that's wonderful that's
[1:31:47] just being able to
[1:31:48] read you want to go to the Token message
[1:31:51] and let me quote from that the prophet
[1:31:53] of God said that's just being able to
[1:31:56] read you believe Jesus was the Christ
[1:31:59] the devil says you're the one sent from
[1:32:01] God yeah did it save
[1:32:07] him you say well now
[1:32:10] then what do I do brother
[1:32:17] Dale one thing you need to remember the
[1:32:20] Bible says no man sought God so you
[1:32:22] think all the time in your life you've
[1:32:23] been seeking God no it's not it's God
[1:32:25] seeking you because you're totally in
[1:32:27] you're you're you're opposite you
[1:32:29] haven't been seeking God it's God been
[1:32:31] seeking you why don't you just slow down
[1:32:33] long enough for him to catch up with you
[1:32:36] amen you know we've tried to save
[1:32:38] ourselves Al until we got out of the
[1:32:40] saving business to work that it doesn't
[1:32:42] even work anymore that's
[1:32:44] right because we tried to save
[1:32:48] ourselves what good thing can you do
[1:32:51] that you might have eternal life
[1:32:54] was not that a question ask the Lord
[1:32:58] Jesus what good
[1:33:01] thing what reason do you think that God
[1:33:04] saved
[1:33:08] you you know what you get out of a lot
[1:33:10] of people of course they ain't going to
[1:33:12] bring it out in front of me cuz they
[1:33:13] know what I've already said so you won't
[1:33:15] say it but a lot of people says well I
[1:33:17] didn't drink reason God saved me I never
[1:33:20] smoked or chew or run around women
[1:33:22] that's why God saved me
[1:33:24] and you know you can even quote brother
[1:33:28] brandom cuz remember Brother brandom 13
[1:33:31] 14 years old when he was dying going
[1:33:33] down you know you remember what he said
[1:33:36] he said the only thing I can say Lord I
[1:33:37] never committed
[1:33:39] adultery who he goes back the other
[1:33:43] way that wasn't what brought him
[1:33:47] back
[1:33:49] right yes but I just I I just wouldn't
[1:33:52] like brother Donnie
[1:33:55] I just don't really see how God could
[1:33:57] save him oh Lord he don't need
[1:34:04] it that's why I said it here right sure
[1:34:08] I didn't
[1:34:09] drink I smoked as a kid throw it away
[1:34:12] cuz I didn't care nothing about it never
[1:34:15] even got a habit out of it or anything
[1:34:16] like that I never did like to cuss cuz I
[1:34:19] like my teeth to stay where they was at
[1:34:21] and I saw a lot of people that use
[1:34:22] vulgar words got them knocked out right
[1:34:25] I'm just
[1:34:27] sensible but you know that didn't save
[1:34:29] me
[1:34:31] right I can understand why the great
[1:34:33] Apostle Paul would stand there that a
[1:34:36] man that was a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[1:34:38] a Hebrew of the Hebrews concerning the
[1:34:41] law he said
[1:34:45] blameless
[1:34:47] y but did that save him no right no
[1:34:52] didn't save him

[1:35:49] thing of Life yes very important yes he

[1:35:56] says that Paul said then you saying that
[1:35:59] let us sin that Grace May abound I don't
[1:36:02] believe in going out living like the
[1:36:04] devil where God can save me don't you
[1:36:06] worry about it you was lost I was lost
[1:36:10] amen we didn't need to be dirty to get
[1:36:12] God to save us that's right right we
[1:36:15] need to die ourselves and accept him as
[1:36:18] our savior
[1:36:20] amen and ask him to come and live in our
[1:36:23] heart
[1:36:26] right brother Gary back there he can
[1:36:29] tell you about a battle he had with it
[1:36:30] we called it the Battle of
[1:36:32] I20 cuz he's riding I20 going to Alabama
[1:36:35] and
[1:36:37] back and he'd call me and he'd say
[1:36:39] Brother D I'm doing pretty good I said
[1:36:40] well
[1:36:42] great one day he called me rest area on
[1:36:46] I20 he said it's over with
[1:36:50] now brother Dale God has just come right
[1:36:53] here and give me the new birth
[1:36:54] Hallelujah I said Thank You
[1:36:57] Lord hallelujah amen cuz it's a person
[1:37:03] amen a person that comes to you amen a
[1:37:06] person like another person like you know
[1:37:08] like
[1:37:09] something don't be
[1:37:12] silly ain't no way to take another
[1:37:14] person and put another person down
[1:37:15] inside of you that's
[1:37:17] right it's not that way it's a spiritual
[1:37:22] condition right it's the life of God
[1:37:25] that comes in to convert the nature of
[1:37:27] the individual person amen right that's
[1:37:31] what the new birth is that's why they
[1:37:33] couldn't have it in the Old Testament
[1:37:35] right amen as great as they were they
[1:37:37] could not be that as great as those
[1:37:40] Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:37:42] were they were not born again
[1:37:45] right they had to die to their own self
[1:37:48] and get born
[1:37:52] again you said look at all them good
[1:37:55] people that's right hell will be full of
[1:37:57] good people that thought they were going
[1:38:00] to heaven right because of something
[1:38:02] they done or didn't do that's right you
[1:38:05] said no brother Dale Hey listen I come
[1:38:07] through them enough I understand we used
[1:38:10] to have a
[1:38:11] homosexual that he loved to paint the
[1:38:14] church well I'm sure when they died they
[1:38:16] painted him into heaven cuz he painted
[1:38:18] the church right
[1:38:24] why that brother paved the parking lot
[1:38:27] don't tell me he ain't in heaven well
[1:38:30] what that got to do with it
[1:38:34] right I like the way old
[1:38:38] U the guy that owned laterno years ago
[1:38:42] up at tcoa he was really a
[1:38:44] multi-millionaire
[1:38:46] guy and he said he said I started giving
[1:38:50] 10% of my salary right from my company
[1:38:55] and everything and he said you know what
[1:38:58] I kept increasing it he said I wound up
[1:39:03] giving 90% right of the income and I
[1:39:08] couldn't spend the 10% right that God
[1:39:10] was giving me to live off of right right
[1:39:14] that's the kind of person I
[1:39:16] like I like the story of JC Penney youve
[1:39:19] heard it where the JC Penny started off
[1:39:21] with little small things kept getting
[1:39:23] bigger and bigger and bigger and finally
[1:39:25] got where he couldn't go to church cuz
[1:39:27] he didn't have no time one old preacher
[1:39:29] went to see him one
[1:39:31] day and he said now miss pennies he said
[1:39:33] you've been missing a lot we worried
[1:39:35] about you and he said yeah I've got to
[1:39:36] work this my business is so big
[1:39:38] everything is so great well I don't have
[1:39:40] time to go to church old preacher said
[1:39:43] well let's pray and then I'll leave he
[1:39:45] got down right beside old JC Penn and he
[1:39:47] said Lord he said Mr Penis has got too
[1:39:50] busy he said so why don't you burn turn
[1:39:53] down his
[1:39:55] buildings take away all of these things
[1:39:58] away from him see he felt a hand holding
[1:40:00] him said hold it you don't have to go no
[1:40:04] further he got the point right Rebecca
[1:40:07] got the point while ago
[1:40:10] right
[1:40:12] Hallelujah sometimes we don't get things
[1:40:15] exactly like we think we want them amen
[1:40:18] but we get what God wants that's right
[1:40:21] right
[1:40:23] but you understand what the new birth is
[1:40:26] it's simply accepting Jesus Christ as
[1:40:29] your savior amen and sometimes you have
[1:40:33] to wait now I I don't believe in taring
[1:40:36] I don't believe in none of that I I'm
[1:40:37] not preaching that way I'm preaching the
[1:40:41] truth when I come in this message I was
[1:40:44] a Baptist deacon at 23 years of
[1:40:47] age I was converted when I was 18 years
[1:40:49] old at 23 years of age I was already a
[1:40:52] bapti Deacon I was teaching adult Sunday
[1:40:55] School classes of the deacons and elders
[1:40:58] and their wives That's what I was doing
[1:41:00] when I quit
[1:41:02] left but when I come in this message I
[1:41:04] begin to read about the baptism of the
[1:41:07] Holy Ghost and I read it from a set of
[1:41:10] eyes that was different than the old
[1:41:11] glces I used to read of thinking I had
[1:41:14] everything when I believe course I never
[1:41:16] did believe it that way I always argued
[1:41:17] with them I said why does the Bible say
[1:41:19] he that
[1:41:20] believeth cuz they didn't like me anyway
[1:41:23] told you about the time we s in the
[1:41:24] deacons meeting the old deacons in the
[1:41:26] Baptist Church this is no joke the
[1:41:28] Baptist Church of deacons believe that
[1:41:30] they have the full authority of the
[1:41:32] church and that if the preacher gets off
[1:41:34] with the Baptist Doctrine you are to
[1:41:36] walk up take his Bible away from him and
[1:41:39] dismiss the congregation and send him
[1:41:41] home and then you vote him
[1:41:42] out I was there I knowed all about it
[1:41:46] you know what I told him in a deacons
[1:41:47] meeting one day I said all I ever found
[1:41:49] in the Bible that the Deacon is supposed
[1:41:50] to do is wait on tables right right they
[1:41:54] didn't like
[1:41:55] it but it was the
[1:41:58] truth but you see there was something
[1:42:00] dealing with me back there that I can
[1:42:02] tell you experiences after
[1:42:04] experiences 11 years old seeing God
[1:42:07] standing in a
[1:42:11] church but you see I didn't have nobody
[1:42:14] to be able to get me to that God right I
[1:42:17] used to talk to them people about it and
[1:42:19] they just look at me right and the
[1:42:22] Baptist one of them fin one day he said
[1:42:23] you need to go to a Pentecostal Church
[1:42:26] you know because they believed in more
[1:42:27] of those
[1:42:28] things but you see when brother brand
[1:42:31] when I heard when brother Mo begin to
[1:42:32] explain the things about it he began to
[1:42:34] tell me about the dead being raised the
[1:42:36] sick being healed I said wait just a
[1:42:40] minute I said all right you saw it he
[1:42:45] said you know Robert Tatum I know
[1:42:47] brother Tatum all life M too he said he
[1:42:50] was there and saw all these things I
[1:42:52] said that's wonderful
[1:42:54] but I said that don't convince me at all
[1:42:57] right but I said you tell me what the
[1:42:59] man
[1:43:01] taught put what the man taught in the
[1:43:03] Bible and I'll know by that whether or
[1:43:06] not he was a prophet right he said boy
[1:43:08] I'm glad of that I'm glad I've run into
[1:43:10] a man that could quote 3/4 of the New
[1:43:12] Testament the old one together he began
[1:43:16] to show me the scriptures and tied
[1:43:17] together I told you about it where it
[1:43:19] back there that that I believe they
[1:43:21] would be two comings of Elijah before
[1:43:22] the end into the world cuz I could read
[1:43:24] Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 I said explain
[1:43:27] that he said brother R Malachi 3 John
[1:43:29] the Baptist Malachi 4 he went through a
[1:43:31] simple
[1:43:34] illustration it tied on I was in the
[1:43:37] word but you see two years I saw
[1:43:42] God reading six books as much as six
[1:43:46] books in one day and listen to two takes
[1:43:49] one going to work and one coming home
[1:43:54] believe in this prophet's
[1:43:56] message but you see there's still
[1:43:58] something
[1:44:00] wrong I had accepted
[1:44:03] God but he had not accepted
[1:44:07] me for two years I sought him crying and
[1:44:13] praying and one day it happened and a
[1:44:17] little old
[1:44:18] altar when the brother told me he said
[1:44:21] quit trying to find anything to be what
[1:44:23] it is I said you know I don't even know
[1:44:25] what I'm seeking for cuz I'm not seeking
[1:44:27] for
[1:44:28] nothing he said because God is a
[1:44:31] person when he said
[1:44:33] that there was the new birth right
[1:44:37] what'd you do brother Dale I fell over
[1:44:40] the floor naturally one way my wife
[1:44:42] received it the same identical time I
[1:44:44] did she fell the other way that was fine
[1:44:47] but you know what happened to me
[1:44:49] ENT I had a whole lot more desire to
[1:44:52] read I had a whole lot more desire to
[1:44:55] search after God and you know that's
[1:44:58] never ended if it ever ends that I don't
[1:45:01] have a desire in my heart to study God's
[1:45:03] word I pray every day every day day in
[1:45:07] and day out I pray God opened the word
[1:45:09] so I can preach to them people where
[1:45:11] they can see
[1:45:13] you amen where they can see you the way
[1:45:16] I see
[1:45:18] you let me explain it that way
[1:45:25] cuz he's
[1:45:27] real it's not just your
[1:45:30] thoughts the new birth is
[1:45:34] real it's the birth of the word so what
[1:45:37] are you going to do keep studying the
[1:45:39] word what do you do pray and read your
[1:45:43] Bible read the message of the
[1:45:46] hour someday God will jump off in pages
[1:45:50] right into your heart right amen and
[1:45:52] it'll be at time of what he wants to do
[1:45:54] right you won't make him force it it'll
[1:45:58] be on his time right but when it come
[1:46:01] don't you worry about it you'll know it
[1:46:03] right you'll know when it's
[1:46:05] come cuz that is the New Birth the birth
[1:46:08] of the word amen then disciples heard
[1:46:11] that word for three and a half years
[1:46:14] that's
[1:46:15] right and look what Peter had to say
[1:46:17] about it he said I was up on a mountain
[1:46:20] over there and I saw Jesus glorified you
[1:46:22] remember Matthew
[1:46:24] 17 but he gets over later in his later
[1:46:27] in his writings and what does he
[1:46:29] say he said I was on the mountain with
[1:46:33] Jesus he said but I have a more sure
[1:46:35] word that's right a prophecy amen that's
[1:46:38] right amen see he was just looking at
[1:46:40] things there but then he had Jesus in
[1:46:42] his heart right he said I have a more
[1:46:44] sure word of Prophecy greater than being
[1:46:47] on the mountain
[1:46:52] God in your
[1:46:54] heart we're going to have the communion
[1:46:56] let's just stand
[1:46:59] together we'll never want to have a
[1:47:02] service without giving an opportunity
[1:47:04] for prayer for salvation for anything
[1:47:06] you need
[1:47:07] of so let's just saying I love him
[1:47:10] anybody that has a need come forth and
[1:47:12] let's be prayed for because we always
[1:47:14] believe in that the main things we
[1:47:16] believe in Salvation
[1:47:19] amen seek God until speaks to
[1:47:24] you and don't you worry about it when
[1:47:27] you find him you're not going to quit
[1:47:29] seeking for him anymore you're going to
[1:47:31] want him so bad until you just want to
[1:47:34] live with him all the time and you
[1:47:35] realize he does live with you all the
[1:47:41] time but brother Dale I'm just not you
[1:47:43] I'm not a
[1:47:44] preacher I sought God for I was a
[1:47:49] preacher all them years I was seeking
[1:47:51] God I wasn't no preacher
[1:47:55] I still don't count myself one because I
[1:47:57] can't explain what I'm talking
[1:48:00] about but I believe
[1:48:03] God I believe he can speak to you if I
[1:48:05] keep talking long
[1:48:08] enough and he can bring it to your heart
[1:48:10] cuz I can't put it in your heart anyway
[1:48:12] brother randam can't put it in your
[1:48:13] heart the Lord Jesus said my own life

[1:53:26] just be with our brother let your
[1:53:28] comfort be there in Jesus
[1:53:38] name
[1:53:46] of we come to the communion time now we
[1:53:48] don't have a close communion our the
[1:53:51] communion is forever Born Again believer
[1:53:53] am that's the qualification of taking
[1:53:56] communion it's not whether or not you go
[1:53:58] to this church or whatever it is and
[1:54:01] it's just means for ever born again
[1:54:03] believer you know and so then you make
[1:54:06] up your mind as to whether or not you're
[1:54:07] born again and that would determine
[1:54:09] whether or not you're capable of
[1:54:11] receiving the communion because that's
[1:54:13] that's the way we believe it so let's
[1:54:15] just read our scriptures and if there's
[1:54:16] anything that anybody has any need of
[1:54:18] getting rid of anything or whatever uh
[1:54:21] just do it now during the time that we
[1:54:23] read the Bible and talk to God for
[1:54:26] yourself and uh you know so let's go to
[1:54:30] First Corinthians 11th chapter 23rd
[1:54:32] verse for I have received of the Lord
[1:54:34] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:54:36] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:54:37] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:54:40] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[1:54:42] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:54:44] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:54:47] me after the same manner also he took
[1:54:49] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:54:51] the new Testament in my blood this do
[1:54:53] you as often as you drink it in
[1:54:55] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:54:58] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:55:00] you in other words you show the Lord's
[1:55:03] death till he come that's the purpose of
[1:55:05] us take it he wherefore whosoever shall
[1:55:08] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:55:09] Lord
[1:55:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:55:13] and blood of the Lord see so you got to
[1:55:15] get rid of your own self and CLE you
[1:55:17] know repent but let a man examine
[1:55:19] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:55:21] and drink of that cup
[1:55:22] see examine yourself to see whether
[1:55:24] you're a Christian or not and then
[1:55:25] repent for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:55:28] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:55:30] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:55:31] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:55:34] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:55:36] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:55:38] be judged now this scripture I love but
[1:55:40] when we are judged in other words we do
[1:55:43] wrong and we repent listen to what it
[1:55:47] says when we are judged we are chastened
[1:55:50] to the Lord that we should should not be
[1:55:52] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:55:54] brethren when you come together to eat t
[1:55:56] one for another and if any man in hunger
[1:55:58] let him eat at home and you come not
[1:56:00] together under condemnation and the rest
[1:56:03] will I set in order when I come
[1:56:08] amen the Bible says that they had a time
[1:56:11] and they T so let's just bow our heads
[1:56:13] and just pray silently to the Lord and
[1:56:16] you know make sure everything's right in
[1:56:18] your own life and say Lord I'm sorry I
[1:56:21] repent
[1:56:23] I want to be worthy to be able to take
[1:56:26] these
[1:56:37] things just have your way now in Jesus
[1:56:43] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:56:45] blessed
[1:56:46] it father we thank you for this bread it
[1:56:49] was made this day for this purpose not
[1:56:52] not to be just a meal or anything but to
[1:56:53] be made to be set aside to work that we
[1:56:56] could take the part that we call the
[1:56:57] communion so we thank you we ask you now
[1:57:00] that we know this is the bread is not
[1:57:03] the body it is only in representation of
[1:57:06] your body because we don't believe that
[1:57:08] it has anything to do within the power
[1:57:10] of being natural but it is all in the
[1:57:12] spiritual understanding that we're to
[1:57:15] eat the word of God until we become that
[1:57:18] word we ask you to sanctify this bread
[1:57:21] and to partake in the name of Jesus
[1:57:23] Christ
[1:57:29] amen see the Bread is
[1:57:32] made we don't believe like a lot of
[1:57:35] churches do a lot of churches just we
[1:57:37] used to when we was in the Baptist we'
[1:57:39] order our our bread
[1:57:42] and it didn't matter who made it where
[1:57:45] it come from it come from an order house
[1:57:47] we keep it for 3 months cuz we didn't
[1:57:50] took communion about every 3 months and
[1:57:52] and we'd keep it and and we'd just take
[1:57:54] it back home and and we just put it in
[1:57:56] the freezer you know and we'd freeze it
[1:57:58] up because you got a pretty good sizable
[1:58:00] bag of it and we just keep it and then
[1:58:02] we just have communion when we got ready
[1:58:04] we see then we found out the truth by
[1:58:07] coming into the message that that's not
[1:58:09] right so we The Bread is made that day
[1:58:12] and will be destroyed what is left over
[1:58:15] will be destroyed before the end or as
[1:58:18] early as we can to destroy it because it
[1:58:21] is like being it was like it was in the
[1:58:23] wilderness when they were eating the
[1:58:25] Mana that the Mana was fine but if they
[1:58:28] tried to keep it over it became
[1:58:31] stagnated so it wouldn't work and we
[1:58:33] don't try to hold over we're trying to
[1:58:36] say Lord give us our daily
[1:58:42] bread father we thank you for this wine
[1:58:44] as went through the process and now it's
[1:58:47] the hour where that it gets better each
[1:58:48] day we ask you to sanctify it because it
[1:58:51] t it is an example of thy blood that was
[1:58:54] shed for each one of us it is not your
[1:58:56] blood it is an example of that blood
[1:58:59] that was given now as we will partake of
[1:59:02] the bread and eat it and then we drink
[1:59:04] this little sip of wine tomorrow that
[1:59:07] will be actually blood cells in our
[1:59:09] body and making us able to live we thank
[1:59:13] you that you died that we might live now
[1:59:15] let us die to ourselves that you can
[1:59:17] live with each one of us in US Lord we
[1:59:19] ask you now to forgive our sins and just
[1:59:22] bless us together sanctify the wine and
[1:59:24] the partakers in Jesus name
[1:59:31] amen I know it was your
[1:59:35] blood I know it was
