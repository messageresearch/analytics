TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're gonna start with Romans record here we go Romans 14 good shut that door anyway so it won't be any disturbance alright now when we've been on Romans 13 we finished it up to put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof we got through that now remember verse chapter 14 as well we kind of ended off that's not a chapter that's a continuation of the letter from 13 to 14 excuse me and then also his his whole letter was put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof then he's continuing his thought him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations now as we were talking last week last Sunday him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations now that would be more of your conversation when somebody comes in new you don't want to beat them to death I'm saying people come in brand-new and the message and people start saying you got to know the seals and you got to know this yeah that's doubtful disputations that don't make them don't put doubts in their mind they got enough doubt in their mind start weak because Satan is gonna absolutely try his best to hinder any new Christian much less the other less older ones it's been in the way for a while but the younger ones are so soft and pliable they're their kin they can be swayed back and forth so Paul's saying look him that's weak in the faith receive him don't do it obviously you got to bring him in and him or her and get it you got to bring them into the bring them into the they're in the family of God they just begin to know their new family members but not to doubtful disputations that brother dig that by me telling he he's always told me that he's bruised a lot of fruit why because he you jump on somebody and then you just all with off you just don't the load you know let's don't look dump the load is what Paul sends one you're gonna see these new week Christians now Paul saw more of that than anybody because the way you would go around to different places setting up churches well they were babies even though even the great mighty church at Ephesus started this baby everybody starts at the baby it set forth 120 in the upper room it started at the faith in the fathers but see then they had to go out and distribute the gospel to babies alright so the babies is ones that like Paul Paul said look this would be careful to bring them in but not to doubtful disputations and the worst thing you can do is bring a new convert in and have two older people sit there and argue about doctrine that's the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is if let them be in the message for a while let them sit let them let them hear what's going on and Paul the same way because you say well we're talking like the message well Paul's message to Paul's message was just important as his day as our messages for our day because Paul had a message for the day and he was delivering that message to a bunch of people he would go to Antioch he would go to this one he would go to Asia he would go to all these different places and he met weak Christians well he didn't go in and and just jump on him about everything in the world no what he stayed with him the Prophet said he stayed with him found one guy that he could establish in the faith well let that person do the preaching then he moved on alright so that's the way we should do I just disagree with these people that go to think they have to go to India Africa or whatever and stay there for years months years you want one even you know with a chance of going to the Philippines in March we're going back to plowing whether it's dirty something you message churches well there's no need for me to go around and preach to all 30 message church but if you'll gather all the ministers in we're gonna gather them all in one place feed them and have a day or two seminar let them answer quite ask question and let us try to watch strengthen them because I want them to go back cuz it wasn't I think it was brother burning you know you come in all that brother from America was good what'd he say I don't know but he was a good brother you know what he be done but if you can get somebody in there established by Paul did and don't go over and argue about stuff go over there and stablish the people and then let that preacher go out like the one at the brother Lisa and Christine Brennan sister Christine run into that was preaching damn 70 wait preaching it correct and didn't even have a chart he's had to the Bible and the message book so that I don't understand how they could we can get so revelation to our own ideas because truthfully I believe if you leave them alone give them a little bit of encouragement give them a little bit of help but leave them alone let them do their job in their community let them do their job in their country rightly and in their language they there's always the land when you go overseas there's always a language barrier and there's always and maybe a preacher not so much but a teacher like myself that needs to take time you're so rushed because you're actually preaching to sermons you're preaching one then you got to wait on that guy to interpret to preach another one so you instead of an hour sermon you've turned it into two hours but you've only give them an hour's worth of content and I don't mind that but still you just don't get as much accomplished I don't think you to view if you were to sit down for two hours and talk to that one brother established the gospel they let him go and preach for years to his congregation and let that congregation what be built up and done like so not to doubtful disputations so let's just keep this in mind just for some simple thought that word it's don't disputation we will do that right here it means a distinguishing discerning or judging alright so in other words disputations is in other words you're sitting around talking about doctrine but he puts this word into it doubtful disputations so doubtful disputations mean that is what you're talking about something the thinking of a man deliberating with himself which means his own idea you don't want to have your own idea you want to just do like Paul says cuz watch now here here he's gonna explain from one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak is herb's if you're vegetarian you're weak know what the Bible says another who is weak eating herbs and I'm gonna have a good salad today but you know what I'm gonna have a good big piece of meat somewhere in there but no look for if one believeth that he may eat all things in other words we use herbs let him not to eat it despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God has received him in other words if they're both bride of Jesus Christ 1 what does it matter if he eats meat or feet if he's a vegetarian all right but what's he saying that he said well that's ok to do that but I'm going to tell you he was meaning in the spiritual also there's meat eaters in the gospel and they're salad eaters in the gospel or milk drinkers don't be so over forceful that you choked the meat down the baby and killed the baby before the baby has time to enjoy its milk then eat something and portal green peas it seems to feeding them still feed babies Oh gross anyway man I like these don't crush them up let me crush them up but you see what I made about it but in the gospel the same way you know somebody you have to bear with somebody let them let them grow up just like you did because you got to remember somebody bore with you while you were growing up so that's what Paul's saying now remember he's going to the Romans with this so he's trying to tell him when he gets there this is what he's gonna do I saw a movie one time about Paul it was a good one Anthony Hopkins played Paul and everybody know what the movie was about was Paul would go into a city and he would now he spent all the time but he would get right in with their customs and listen to what was going on and and I said he would if there was it was a place where they need any fish he didn't eat fish he'd go and say blessed God I'm officiator give me some fish no he he waved it around and he stayed there with him it showed him in the movie even coming in and playing with the kids and dancing with them and well why I mean if you bring a guy in and you just bring him in like a policeman and you start hammering people a lot of people gonna move away from them but if you'll come in and not judge the people that doesn't need strong me I know we preach everybody even strong me but you got there there has to be diversity in the body there's there's diversity in the body some people in light milk if they're still bribed they're right mr. right if they like milk they're still right but don't put them down but now remember too if you're called to be a meat-eater you'll find somewhere where to meet that and you'll you'll start eating meat of the meat of the gospel who aren't now that judges another man's servant to his own master he standeth or falleth do I understand that I I'm not to judge he's even branding in the carnal aspect of another man's servant I'm not supposed to look at another man's servant and say why is he doing this well if he's a servant of mama than I what's my business well they have an agreement with me if I have a servant in the house that's we saying but he's also saying the same thing about I like what brother Brennan said every Church is sovereign every Church is sovereign it is like brother Lenore said if you want to play tape you know they become like so my plan do you want to play tapes every Sunday afternoon and you're the pastor of that church there's no eye makeup whose before you know for what for us to say you can't do that there is no right or wrong in that aspect now I don't have to stick there and listen to it I can move I can go somewhere else to his own master he standeth or falleth so in other words with God we're all gonna be judged separate as individuals run gonna be judges agree yeah he shall be holding up for God is able to make him stand see what that were holding me made to stand for God is able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another man esteemeth every day alike you see what he's saying he's giving us a contrast cuz some people and it's okay to do that some people enjoy going and and looking at like we went through the feast days and all that stuff in the Jewish aspect it's okay to study that but let's don't stay on it because we're not youth we get enough of the spirituality of the Jew part then for us too and you see it sometimes I I take it back to another message preacher but some I own in internet that he brings in this Jewish guy they do all these Jewish rituals I don't see any I don't see any profit to that and I don't look on the calendar and see when it's one's ID when it's this side and that I'm you know all the things like that I don't I don't care I really don't and that's what Paul's saying but now don't don't bash the person that does that they have a maybe they have a purpose to do that I just don't think that that we as Gentiles have anything to do with Jewish custom we should not we shouldn't do the Chanukah no but it is it is good though like we were talking about last night Bible study it is good that you can see that Jesus was killed on Passover because he was the Paschal Lamb he was the Passover him he had to be killed on Passover and he had to come he had to come back onto that Pentecost as a baptism of the Holy Ghost 50 days after his comes from the feast of Passover until the feast of Pentecost is 50 days this plane caught picked up Pentecost is 50 days so Jesus had to come back in the form of the Holy Ghost 50 days after the crucifixion three days he was you know Friday Saturday and Sunday hero heroes we were talking about the 30 to 40 days and then Jesus goes back and the sins 11 days before the before the feast of Pentecost go that's what the Bible says when the feast of Pentecost was day of Pentecost was fully come which means that fiftieth day that's when the Holy Ghost fell burning so heated up three days in 11 days you got your thirty to forty days that Jesus was among the people in the glorified body and we're brother Ralph says because there's no Bible to say that we're gonna be here 30 40 days after the resurrection brother Branham is typing it that we're going to be here for 30 40 days like Jesus when he raised in the glorified body until his ascension was 30 to 40 days right and then brother Branham explains very very well instead well we didn't get to read it last night but I was flipping to him where he said the Lord knows we know we're gonna meet him in the air so he's not here physically but when those those Saints come he said you'll he said what will do is it will take that time to be with family and ask who made it who didn't make it be able to see the people that were going up with that's what brother Brown told us that that 30 to 40 days is Jesus knows that all the attention won't be on him because we know we're going to when we take a rafter we know we're going to meet him in the air is what okay so we basically not go meet Jesus here we're going to meet him in here so we're looking forward to that but in between that time of Resurrection and ambani change there's going to be a 30 40 day period for us to get what acquainted with the ones that have come back that's what that's what the Prophet says so that's exactly what I feel that it's not going to be it's not a doctrine that thirty to forty days but he's typing it with Jesus go remember him when he resurrected you resurrected new glorified body he was seen at the road of a mass he was seen of almost five hundred brethren the Bible says so he was seen of a lot of people but only one hundred and twenty one to the upper room so same way with us there's only going to be a small group of people that in this age that takes that distinction so it's just a time there is no nowhere in the Bible that says we're gonna be here because the Bible says we shall be changed in a moment to Uncle benign because of McLaurin doesn't say you know nothing about dazing but we we don't even assume because I can't assume even brother Brown said we will be here thirty to forty days so we will be here for thirty to forty days to get acclimated with each other get our body changed then to see who made it see who didn't make it and then we're going to come to a place where we take them a physical rapture and go into another dimension where Jesus is how is the rapture you know fellowshipping with people that have gone and come back yeah but nobody's gonna be able to sing with you no matter who may have seen them with you that's the secret yeah yeah but what go ahead everybody's not gonna say it no they're just gonna think you're much more crazy than they thought you were before because you're talking to them going there and there's people standing here and you're standing there talking to them they call that they have a name for that what we did what we didn't realize last night we didn't bring we didn't bring this thought into bear that 30 to 40 days this is what I see is there's going to be such a worldwide chaotic condition they're not gonna care whether you stand and talk to that wall either California is going to sink or getting ready to sink series of earthquakes are going to happen the world economies go they're not gonna care where you are because remember we're not going to be hunting down our persecution has come where we may become up to that point we might not get a meal or two or we might have to you know give our life for the gospel but we'll be the ones that come up but yet during that time it's not gonna be them and there's not gonna be and I found a quote last night I'm getting away from this book it's a question on our mind we're brother I've said the graves will open the great listen the graves will not physically open you know I'm gonna walk out and in the funeral I mean in the graveyard and someone's gonna have piles of dirt pull back and something's not know that's the secret part cuz they're gonna come they're gonna take that glory they're gonna come down with that deokman II connect with that body you make it glorified and do just like Jesus didn't walk through wall they just don't come pure moments okay so that is the secret part it is a secret company you can tell everyone but if they're not bright and if they're not born again they're gonna think you're an idiot because they're not gonna be able to see it no only the bride will see each other only the born-again believers know foods birds and rest of the world they're not born again so they have nothing to connect with see we're talking about people and places it's all the Holy Ghost inside you use your theophany if you're born again then it's just as eternal as God is already now somebody's not born again they're not eternal that to me that's the secret part is that even the foolish virgins and I was looking up that quote I find it later on we're underground simpler Christian people so-called plan people after the rapture takes place we'll still think they're getting saved now they came so who's doing that the devil is doing that the devil's making what's the devil do it now he's making people believe they're safe when they're not so that's the same thing and then then brother Branham also said he said he said some people will be standing like I said last night they'll be listing a lot of disrespect for happen I thought this was supposed to happen I thought this was supposed to happen he said that smell still small voice will speak and say you missed it it's already happened now that may be to the food see that would be the meat of the foods virgin because nobody else that can he's not gonna go to the drunk in the bar room and say hey buddy you missed it now he's going to go to the religious group they come to sanctification they made their self pure in in their spirit realm but not in their soul right and their foolish version so he's gonna come with them say hey you missed it something brother Brown said they would have to give their life in the tribulation period for what they believe because there is going to be a group of people that's going to be killed during the period that our foolish virgins they're going to have to give their life for even what they stand for even in sanctified condition so there's that group of people that's going to probably let me finish your your question they won't be able to see the dead Saints well calm wycombe dead Saints are not dead the Saints we can't see right now then we're going to be able to see there is insane if they're not gonna if they're going to be here and we're going to be able to converse with them then the foolish version is going to be so close because remember they were right there saying give me some of that oil they were right there with the five wives and foods were not even in two buildings they were in the same building basically the same place because there was five wise and five foolish they were in the same place they weren't one in one country and one another they were wearing the same place because what happened is when the foolish realized the wives we're getting ready to go they what give us some of your own they knew where to go to give us some of your also they gonna be so close that they're gonna be able to maybe even feel the pull or feel what's going on or even to leave in a foolish virgin if if your foolish virgin you got enough of God in you to know that there's supposed to be a rapture a chatter of Resurrection the change in a rapture so it's what I mean not to the whole world but to that foolish virgin maybe that's when God will say you miss them and but maybe he'll comfort say look I got to put you through tribulation because you didn't exactly accept everything you got but you're gonna have to die for me and to me that's great I mean that's wonderful and get it tomorrow yes they are virgins they're virgins because they're burned into something they're not they're not polluted by the world so they'd be real honest with you most of them is gonna be people that thinks they're right of this message so the preachers can't preach any birth the way it's supposed to be preached so they're gonna be food that's why you call them foolish virgins okay now that we got all that subject ain't Carol let's get back to what we were talking about one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind so in other words have a conviction convinced our conviction in your own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and he doesn't guard if not the day to the Lord he does not regard it he that eateth eateth to the Lord free giveth God thanks when we should pray over our food even God thinks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself no worries you're not your own gun you're not you're gonna you're living by principle and you're gonna die by principle natural or spiritual because people are gonna die spiritually they don't accept God with what they got to do they have to turn down die right for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's for to this in Christ both died and rose and revived that he might be the Lord both of the Dead and the living so that puts everything let's see what they are they're lived again you come across did he die rose and I stated last night and go back what we were talking about the resurrection and brother Dale was talking about Satan impersonating the resurrection he can do that the way he can impersonate the resurrection is how we're going to see the resurrection of people coming here and glorified bodies but who's to say that God will not be still raising the dead of people just not in glorified box difference then one of me I guess not anyway you do okay some do some don't so for those adult will go explain so what happens is we're gonna be standing we're gonna see the dead Saints walk in there glorified bodies they're gonna be able to mmm their characteristic is they can vanish they can reappear they can walk through the wall but they're not going to be hindered but now because remember brother Brown said that God's the one that raises the dead no problem with that and Satan can't do that but there can be an impersonator that can raise the dead but have a false doctrine yeah absolutely the prayer is the prayer to God to raise the dead so if we raise somebody physically here's what I'm saying it here we are in the church and we see the dead Saints come among us then this other church comes running in and says we've had three people raising them today there's a difference there that one they're talking about it's not resurrected then they got resurrected and they're going to die again they didn't come back in the glorified body they came back just like Lazarus in the regular body everybody got that okay there is no comeback in their normal body but what's to say that Pete the people over here go and say well we've got part of the resurrection tell you well then you have to buy their free fuel no best thing to do is is grab them carnally like my daddy's Karl and grab the person is going against the wall if he goes through it it's glorified maybe no you probably need to be pray for again if I got that say man but drive them in God can raise the dead now the only thing is is you have to look at the fruit it bears you look and see if that resurrected persons he resurrects back in his regular body that's not a glorified resurrection that's not the resurrection we're talking about resurrection worked on about is that person will never die again when a person walks back into the end of this dimension he's is glorified as Jesus was when he come out of the grave so remember that but also remember like said that people like Lazarus and many people that were raised Jairus his daughter all those people were physically raised from the dead but they were raised back into their fifth condition there's another thing you're going to be able to tell the difference is when that person is truly resurrected in a bride rapture they're not old when you break forward something later what similar saying that if you resurrected yeah absolutely yes yes unless he's bright and takes a body change but we we know that he's probably gonna pass on these older nice he's not I don't even know that he's a believer if he believes he got ready from the dead but see you don't have to be a believer to get ready to be raised from the dead I would say a lot of people list that or not a lot but several people maybe in the whole world has been resurrected that's not Christian that that has no the one y'all did do I want it y'all pray far right Randall that's what he's done with Hubble yeah yeah um no he's in this one I mean he's not he but there's no stipulation when it comes to healing but you got to keep Christianity and healing and and and glorified body all that needs to be separated cuz it's not in one big just because Randall was resurrected from the dead has no bearing on his salt it just raised him from the dead he was out of his body and then we called his buyer that brother Dale called his body bite and there he was called his soul back to the body within my hand but when he do that then then you have to go the next step be a Christian believe the message early I worked it take a body change see what I'm saying so you can't just lump everything together and say well just cause you a ray from the dead means you're going in Iraq no I had zero effect on anything but bringing you back into this world and what it may do is it may bring you back into this world to give you another opportunity to be saved remember what brother Brown said about that girl right and he said I thought pronounced her healed and she died and brother Brown see I he owed me an explanation I don't think I'd ever say that but he's 20 said he see God you owe me an explanation but you know what he said he said he let me steal over it for three months never told him nothing but about three months later he come to him and said she was supposed to die back there and that whatever that and drowning accident of something he said I gave her another chance to come to me and she did and now she's going home so to me that's grace absolutely all this was grace anything you still this is Grace it's all grace of God cuz he said they're both the dead and living still the Lord of the Dead am i living yeah he's Lord of everything when he stands at that white throne judgment all that's gonna be standing in front of him is dead basically spiritually dead yeah and he's going to pass judgment but he's gonna also tell him look I came to you at a certain day I'm telling you that's the way I see it God's gonna say I gave you a day time and he'll give him the hour I came to you and you don't want that person going one can know that and he'll go that's correct he'll know right then that he turned it down and he's done and Oh heavenly days so anyway he's Lord of the Living Dead in the living but one of us now judge thy brother or one us outset acknowledge despise at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ now hold on right there that's the same thing what we've been talking about you can't take general resurrection resurrection of the bed and glorified body resurrection you can't put them three together they're three totally separate things same way with this we are not going to stand before the white throne judgment so you can erase that so there is a judgment of the deeds down the body he'll cover it later on I don't think in here but we all stand before the judgment seat of Christ but you know what you and I stand right now this is our judgement seat but not your soul your soul can't be judged it's judged in Memphis born-again you can't be judged it was judged in Christ so we all will stand before the judgment seat of Christ of Christ for his written as I live saith the LORD every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so we're all gonna give up a judgment the things we did good or bad have to either get rid of them here or Karam over there one of the thing but it's not gonna be whether you gonna be bright or not if you're already bright he can't take you back out of judgment we judge you there's no such thing that's why it will study the law of this land you know what double jeopardy means double jeopardy means you cannot be tried if you're found innocent for murder of a certain person you can never be tried for that again that's been forever you know where they got it from they got from the Bible you can't be judged twice the only judge one time for one thing yes have you killed another person yes but now for that you can't bring that back you can't even bring that back out never it's a lot of times they'll bring something up enough and the judges they strike that from the record it won't it won't be recorded now good lawyer though will say that you know and it'll be planted in somebody's mind you know but remember we got a judge we got a jury and we got a prosecuting attorney and a defense attorney that's the same person so and he can't forget because it was it will be brought up in a time and then he but he said I don't remember that coming up in court thank God cuz it's in the Co forgive when it's never to be remembered yeah that's why we don't have sin in our soul we don't have seen we're not sinners that's all we're not and we're sinners in our spirit realm all right we're saying some experiment that's all kind of work on everything's your bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another any more but Judge this rather that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way now that's the whole summation of of 1 through 12 he's some he's summarizing this in verse 13 the guy wants to eat me my brother Dale said do you want to cook for Christmas train don't complain that the ones that don't the one that don't don't complain once if you just will leave it alone then it's not therefore judge one another anymore but Judge this rather that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way just like sit right here he just weakened of faith don't set her out that's what we did I said we all of us from 1965 to the end of the 80s and maybe close to the 90s and probably still now we've argued over different things of the message how can you argue over something that's pure and perfect you can't the way you can Vicky we're not supposed to they already know her hair and dress this TV don't do this don't you take kids out of school keep the kids in school don't do this do that don't that's doubtful disputations I mean another preacher was talking on the phone the other night he had heard me online when we were talking about prayer lines and stuff and to me that's what's hurt us and he agreed that's what's killed us if it were depending on somebody else to pray for us when you got to do it yourself you guys got to do it yourself you got pray for yourself this Catholicism because what is the two spirits in the framework of the church it's not Catholicism and random ism it's what I'm preaching the seals it's the dark horse or the colored horse and the white horse is two white dog in the black dog and the problem is it's like brother Brown called laying on the pan even palms going to cover in a little while we're going to read it later on in the scripture where he says don't delay all names he even said that we got to come from that what our problem is we have depended on it it's been our crutch for 40 years you don't take a body change going to a prayer line you might get healed you might get saved but you're not gonna get a buddy James going through a prayer line you're gonna change what's inside you is gonna change your body brother the old normal a his hands on you as mighty as we know is mighty we know what God is he's never gonna lay his hands on you and say your body's changed he can't do that that is not his purpose no that will never happen that's right that's right but you got to overcome yourself he that overcometh that didn't save the group that overcoming brother bill is going to cover that he that overcometh in other words he she eats like he got a stomach tube right so it's she and eventually we overcome these things that's why we don't we don't dispute on somebody they can't overcome this we pray for them sure and they pray for you because everybody's got I've got a weakness that maybe you'd look at me and say how silly but it's mine and I got to deal with it I like it your weakness and your weakness may be something so frivolous that everybody kind of giggles it but you shouldn't do that you need to help them if that's what you got overcome listen he's an overcoming brother Ram said what it's not what you overcome it's how you overcoming all right so there's no name there's not a list of no that's how you overcome it dude Jesus Christ I know and then persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself now he's heading back to what he was talking about because I remember now Paul's a Jew he's fixing to go to Rome when she's Gentiles but Paul's at you and the Jews don't need clovenfooted animals and all that stuff that they told them in the New Testament not to eat even when God came to Peter remember when the she come down and all the unclean beasts were in that vision that thought Peter had when he was getting ready to go to the Gentiles members and an angel says eat these Peter says I've never eat them never I've never touched anything like that and the angle says no amen there's nothing wrong with this in other words you're fixing what Peter's saying is I never touched him Gentiles they think I did things in Joker's are they they're savages they're they're just nations of of illegitimate people and then the angel comes up and says well you're fixin to go to because you're going to open the door and then this man named Paul is gonna step in and he's gonna take over but Peters wanted open the door to the Gentile going into the Gentiles and Peter's like you're not talking about eating cows or my pigs and you thought about going to the pig people yeah we thought about going to feed people there's nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat from whom Christ died in other words you heard one thing spiritually the same thing you can't feed a baby deep on the steak or ribeye steak you might can chop it up a little bit feed him a little at a time but he's gonna choke eventually so when you when I I guess when I go somewhere that's my whole concern is don't let me choke the people now a man died a long time ago my first part of them like brother dick said I breathe a lot of fruit but now you're trying to be you try to be charitable to everybody in the congregation you don't try to just well if I get it they get it they don't they don't know you you know take your baby and then just set your baby over in the corner when it's born and so well you're going to get you are getting made or you just gonna die no you can't do that you go go and give it some milk then you give it some of them old ground-up green peas but now apricots and where do you see that's play my part I love it I still am as a precaution when mother feel that feed Anna comes I'm 13 years older so we all kind of raised down a mama I kind of urge her goodbye because extra apricot baby food comes I love them matched up apricots now the the peas she could have not bought one of them and it's a started on now but she still bought them anyway and but now they may have a cost I was a little giant if I could go get me a little if he look down the would she to found the empty jars no doubt huh she's wondering where all the apricots went there's 25 25 cans of green peas but hey because we're going that's why I will same way in the gospel you have to be careful everybody's different in the congregation look to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean but if I'd rather be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with uh meat from whom Christ died let not then your good be evil spoken up alright we have enough of that so just be careful with it for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost for he that is in these things for he that for he that in these things service Christ is acceptable with God except we've got improved of men let us therefore follow the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify one another now he's talking about spiritually edifying spiritually I mean frame me for me destroy not the work of God all things indeed are pure but it is evil that that man who eateth with the fence in other words don't cram it down stroke it is good neither the flesh nor drink wine or anything where Bilaam brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak past our faith he's asking a question have it to thyself before God so understand before it's an individual affair with God we grow up this time to a perfect man as a total individual we are not doing that as a collective group it's individuals all right happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he allows a man just be just don't condemn yourself and you know if you like to drink milk that's good but now our age calls for more there is more than milk there was a time when maybe you only got milk but when you see there's more meat than you need to grow up and go into the meat part but don't consume condemn if you drink a little bit of milk every once in a while or ain't gonna bread milk couple days ago but now I don't have it all the time I just found some corn bread somebody hid in the back of the fridge better I like corn bread mmm but if you don't like bread milk don't don't give me a me for lacking one bread milk you understand what I'm saying it's same way the gospel don't condemn me for for liking the deep things of God when you don't I shouldn't condemn you but I shouldn't - you that there is more we'll see we guy there's a fine balance in about we must didn't - you that there is more to have besides milk cuz you know if you put in a room and all you got speak two cans of milk I saw her you know to drink if somebody walks in and you're about 25 and you're still drinking milk you notice of my waltz in this is what Dan what kind of state thank you rib eye medium rare I like it see I can meet him right me and right okay something I can meet you but anyway doesn't matter but you bring that in and go hey taste this now if you say no I just I love my milk there's something wrong with you at 25 years old you need to take a bite now when you think about that steak what you're gonna do you're gonna throw the milk out Youkilis 30 today same way in the gospel he they doubted this down if he eat because he eateth not a faith so so what's his whole summation to lift but whatsoever is not of faith is sin all right let's go will spleen a little more back up a little bit [Music] [Music] take it right off
