[0:00] brother Bron preached different messages
[0:02] on door he said
[0:06] uh door and door I stand at the door
[0:09] knock uh door to the
[0:12] heart but uh what what I want to talk
[0:14] this morning about is
[0:17] uh the key to the door then I went up
[0:20] here was faith is the key and Jesus is
[0:23] the
[0:28] door s right
[0:34] like to talk to Sister GW
[0:38] upstairs let's go to uh Revelation 20
[0:56] verse1 in the message said ke to the
[0:59] door brother
[1:00] said now in the Book of Revelation
[1:03] beginning with verse one I wish to read
[1:05] the 20th verse on the first first
[1:09] verse of the 20th chapter he said I saw
[1:13] an angel come down from heaven having a
[1:16] key of the bottomless pit and a great
[1:19] chain in his hand he said now wish to
[1:22] speak if it would be if I could call it
[1:24] the text from this or draw a context
[1:27] from this text so that uh next 20 or 25
[1:31] minutes I would like to call it the key
[1:33] to the door he said I do not wish to
[1:36] call it the keys because Peter was given
[1:39] the keys to the
[1:40] kingdom but I want to call it the key to
[1:43] the
[1:45] door he said now key notice here as we
[1:49] read that this angel came down from
[1:51] heaven having a key in his hand I
[1:54] believe it's Revelation 13 or 19 we find
[1:58] again another angel coming
[2:00] with a key and a key is a purpose of a
[2:03] key is to unlock something something
[2:06] that's been locked up or it's something
[2:09] that should be locked up but a key is
[2:12] given for that
[2:14] purpose now there are many kinds of keys
[2:17] because we have many US of keys there
[2:20] are keys to the storehouses there keys
[2:22] to your own house there's key to your
[2:26] automobile and we call them
[2:28] keys and they are keys and they can be
[2:32] duplicated many
[2:34] times or to the house there sometimes
[2:38] can be made what we call a skeleton key
[2:41] in other words it's a key that's kind of
[2:44] made with levels act on it that the
[2:47] twist the lock in a certain way and can
[2:50] almost unlock any door called a skeleton
[2:53] key it's a skeleton frame of many keys
[2:57] and they can be unlocked that way with
[3:00] our houses or even to our Auto
[3:04] automobiles can be
[3:06] duplicated any key cannot unlock no door
[3:09] unless it's used by hand it's got to
[3:11] have something to use the key the key in
[3:15] itself cannot use itself it's got to
[3:18] have something to
[3:28] yield
[3:32] men carry a few
[3:36] keys and women
[3:45] carry my
[3:48] keys somebody told me that a lot of
[3:50] women carry a lot of keys and puts a
[3:53] strain on your ignition I don't know if
[3:55] it's true or not
[3:56] asking sometimes they have to change
[3:58] that ignition itself
[4:02] because the way the technology is sh g
[4:06] roll may have SE for
[4:09] here lotions and hand sanitizer and all
[4:12] that
[4:15] stuff he when you asked me to borrow my
[4:19] keys I didn't know you were going to
[4:25] bash let's go to Daniel

[5:08] knowledge shall
[5:13] increase you buy a electronic uh piece
[5:17] of equipment or something uh next week

[5:21] better Bea was sh me that U iPad I
[5:25] pretty neat you know you can write your
[5:26] little notes on there whatever you know

[6:25] car going down the road and that
[6:27] nobody's driving at the people are back
[6:29] playing some kind of game or something
[6:31] but I think I'm not sure I think they
[6:33] have to have the sensors or something to
[6:36] put on the road to make
[6:39] it oll I
[6:43] guess I got an article it says
[6:47] uh a California company Tuesday will
[6:50] announce an iPhone application and car
[6:53] receiver that will enable users to lock
[6:56] and unlock and remotely start to car
[6:59] with the phone rather than with the car
[7:02] car
[7:03] keys the Viper Smart Start is the latest
[7:06] example of automatic technology El
[7:09] Electronics functions migrating into
[7:12] Apple iPhone and other
[7:14] smartphones including turn by turn
[7:16] directions or located in the closest gas

[7:22] a challenge for
[7:23] automakers aftermarket suppliers to for
[7:27] whom advanced auto electronics been
[7:29] highly
[7:32] profitable the Smart Start remote start
[7:36] and locked up lets the owner be really

[11:30] lock and when you find a key it's got to
[11:32] be some treasure something that's
[11:34] worthwhile or you want to even lock it
[11:36] up if it ain't worth locking it up just
[11:39] let it go but when it's worth locking it
[11:41] up so key usually is a note to something

[11:48] worthwhile the key that's what's it for
[11:52] now it unlocks something that's worth
[11:57] well
[12:02] let's go to St John
[12:15] 10 John
[12:17] 10 starting at uh start at 7 s
[12:27] verse then Jesus said unto them again
[12:30] verily verily I say unto you I am the
[12:32] door of the sheep all that ever come
[12:34] before me are thevs and rubbers but the
[12:37] Sheep did not hear them I am the door by
[12:40] me if any man Enter he shall be saved
[12:44] and shall go in and out and find pasture
[12:47] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[12:50] and to kill and to destroy I am come
[12:53] that they might have life and that they
[12:55] might have it more abundantly I'm the
[12:58] good
[12:59] Shepherd the Good Shepherd give his life
[13:02] for the sheep and he did at the
[13:09] cross but he that is in Harland and not
[13:13] the shepherd who's own the sheep or not
[13:15] see if the wolf cometh and leaveth the
[13:17] sheep and flee and the Wolf catch them
[13:20] and scare the Sheep the harling flee
[13:23] because he is a harling and care not for
[13:26] the Sheep said I am the good Shepherd
[13:29] and know my sheep I am known of mine as
[13:32] the father knowe me even so know I the
[13:36] father and I lay down my life for the
[13:44] Sheep brother brother boy talks about
[13:46] when he goes to camp he lays at the
[13:49] close to the door so them kids don't get
[13:51] out at night so he's kind of like
[13:53] playing that the Good Shepherd at the
[13:57] door
[14:09] Jesus said I the door to sheep I'm the
[14:11] door not a door the door the only door
[14:14] on the on the way the only way the truth
[14:18] and life and no man cometh unto the
[14:21] father but by me I'm the door to the che
[14:25] and all that come before me is enemies
[14:27] theves and R he's the door to sheeple he
[14:30] is the door to
[14:32] Salvation there's not another name given
[14:34] under heaven where you must be saved
[14:36] only through the name of Jesus Christ no
[14:39] church no denomination no Creed no
[14:42] doctrines of anything only through Jesus
[14:45] name that is that is the
[14:48] key no wonder Peter could use one of
[14:51] them on the key they a Pentecost they
[14:53] wanted to know how to get into the door
[14:56] he used the the key and there's only
[14:58] only one key because there's just one
[15:01] door I am the door and Peter had that
[15:04] key to it and he said repent every one
[15:07] of you and be be baptized in the name of
[15:10] Jesus Christ for the commission of your
[15:11] sins and you shall receive the treasures
[15:13] of God it's the key to the door and
[15:16] Jesus is the door there's only one door
[15:19] to healing and Jesus is that
[15:21] door there's only one door to peace yeah
[15:24] my peace I give unto you he's only one
[15:28] he's the only Lord to jine
[15:31] peace you might think you got peace you
[15:34] might accumulate enough money to buy
[15:36] your home might accumulate no money to
[15:38] get your children cloes have food to eat
[15:41] but you might have accumulated enough
[15:44] populated to be popular amongst the
[15:46] people but when you slip off your shoes
[15:49] at night and get ready to lay down
[15:51] there's only one thing can give you
[15:53] peace and that is if you know you were
[15:56] dying that night there's only one one
[15:59] peace and that's Jesus is the peace
[16:01] peace are
[16:05] peace he our healing I'm the Lord Our
[16:08] God and heals all our diseases he is the
[16:10] door to heaven and there's no other or
[16:14] no other way but through Jesus Christ he
[16:16] is the door to heaven and now Jesus is
[16:19] the door to all these things and faith
[16:21] is the key and unlocks the
[16:23] door now if Jesus is the door to all
[16:26] this Promises of God they and has
[16:29] finished work unlocks every door to
[16:31] every treasure there is inside the
[16:34] kingdom of God see he is Faith is the
[16:38] key that unlocks every promise he makes
[16:41] the key of Faith does that faith and his
[16:44] finished work is this keys that were
[16:47] were speaking
[16:48] on now in Hebrews 11 chapter I got a
[16:53] great string of themer rald down here of
[16:56] these Heroes of fa it was the key to the
[16:58] door that stuffed them mou the
[17:01] Lions it was the key of faith that
[17:04] unlocked the prison
[17:05] houses he was Faith the key of faith
[17:08] that quenched the violence of fire
[17:10] escaped the edge of the sword but the
[17:12] dead back to life again it was Faith the
[17:16] key of faith in the living of God that
[17:18] had that man that woman who can take the
[17:21] key of faith that can unlock every
[17:23] promise God made but if you haven't got
[17:26] that key you're just
[17:29] you you'll never unlock it you'll be
[17:31] against it because this key any correct
[17:35] make key have levs on the inside of lock
[17:39] that they take a certain form certain
[17:41] shape of anti to turn this level and
[17:45] just one little level out of the way
[17:47] will mess the whole thing
[17:57] up
[18:05] you know a key that locks unlocks too
[18:07] see me can't lose her V that's right the
[18:09] same key that locks unlocks the key that
[18:12] unlocks and lock up and that's exactly
[18:15] see because it works both ways how
[18:17] pitiful it is that church has lost his
[18:20] vision of that What a Sad thing it was
[18:23] when the church sold the sell out to
[18:26] Creed as we've done today and now called
[18:29] to
[18:36] unite see the key Vision the word of the
[18:39] Lord there's nothing can change it or
[18:41] stop it what the church needs tonight is
[18:43] not an education what the church needs
[18:45] tonight is not a denomination what the
[18:47] church needs tonight is not a greed what
[18:50] the church needs tonight is a key to the
[18:52] scripture the door which Christ is the
[18:54] door and he is the work faith and the
[18:56] work of the Living God
[19:00] out
[19:10] of let's go to Matthew uh
[19:14] 7
[19:22] 78 said ask and it shall be given seek
[19:25] and you shall find knock and it shall be
[19:27] open to you for everyone that ask it
[19:30] receive it and he that seek it find it
[19:33] and he and through him that knock it
[19:36] shall be open the key is
[19:40] ask ask is the key just like brother
[19:43] talks about sister uh hary right that
[19:46] she said the right thing he said
[19:49] uh he said God just told me that you
[19:52] could ask for anything that you wanted
[19:54] but she asked for the Salvation of the
[19:55] two boys he said he would ask for a
[19:57] million
[19:59] God been
[20:12] obligated let's go to Psalms uh
[20:27] 8410
[20:40] David said for day that course is better
[20:43] than thousand I rather be a doorkeeper
[20:45] in the house of my God than to dwell in
[20:47] the tense
[20:51] wickedness let's go to 1 Chronicles
[20:57] 15:23
[21:15] now David wasn't just talking about
[21:16] being a a a doorkeeper cuz they there is
[21:19] doorkeepers to the ark and
[21:22] uh one place in Second Kings I talked
[21:25] about three ladke Keepers right here
[21:27] talks about two uh 1 Chronicles
[21:32] 1523 I don't know why they make these
[21:34] Nam so hard to
[21:38] pronounce and bar CH and El were
[21:42] doorkeepers for the
[21:49] ark this go to Matthew uh
[21:57] 3134
[22:06] 25 25 sorry
[22:09] 25 25 31 and
[22:19] 34 it says when the son of man shall
[22:22] come in his glory and all the Holy
[22:23] Angels of him and then shall he sit upon
[22:26] the throne of his glory
[22:28] and before him shall be gather all
[22:31] nations he shall separate them from one
[22:34] another as a Shepherd divides his sheep
[22:37] his sheep from his goats and he shall
[22:39] set the Sheep on the right his right
[22:41] hand but the goat on the
[22:44] left then shall the king say unto them
[22:47] on his right hand Come Ye blessed are my
[22:49] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[22:52] you from the foundation of the
[22:56] world
[22:59] so we have to we have to make sure we
[23:01] are cheap not goats or something else
[23:06] amen thank you thank
[23:16] you
