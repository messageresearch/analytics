[34:12] we pray that you would touch her and
[34:14] just bring her out of this CU Satan's
[34:17] doing everything he can to try to hinder
[34:19] in any
[34:19] way your move among us but we lord call
[34:24] the hand of Satan to where that it's not
[34:27] not us is what you've given us the
[34:30] authority to
[34:31] speak and pray and believe God's word we
[34:35] love you we thank you in Jesus name amen
[34:40] Romans
[34:43] 8
[34:45] 28 for we know that all things work
[34:47] together for them that love God to them
[34:50] who are the called according to his
[34:53] purpose for whom he did for know he did
[34:56] also predestin toate to be conformed to
[34:59] the image of his son that he might be
[35:01] the first born among many Brethren
[35:04] moreover whom he did
[35:06] predestinate them he also called and
[35:09] whom he called them he also Justified
[35:12] and whom he justified them he also
[35:14] glorified what shall we then say to
[35:17] these things if God be for us who can be
[35:20] against us amen you may be seated the
[35:22] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[35:25] the
[35:26] word
[35:28] now I know and
[35:30] realizing I said I'll speak a little bit
[35:32] and then you get ready with your
[35:34] comments and questions and things but I
[35:37] know when realize that trying to drive
[35:40] things down
[35:42] hard you know to make it to where uh you
[35:45] will understand that I leave so many
[35:48] loopholes and uh problems of
[35:52] understanding and I was just thinking
[35:55] that you might think well well brother
[35:57] Dale doesn't make the the uh elect the
[36:01] bride of
[36:03] Christ uh the the great
[36:06] position uh you know that she should be
[36:10] I I differ with you I don't think that
[36:14] I've ever tried to do anything but make
[36:15] her to that position you know to give
[36:18] her to that place to where she would be
[36:21] able to stand upon God's word and and
[36:24] believe it and be what he wants us to be
[36:29] because you know that way it's not just
[36:31] putting us all on one level I believe in
[36:34] the elect I believe in The Bride of
[36:37] Jesus Christ as being the the greatest
[36:40] of all that's ever happened on the earth
[36:43] outside of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[36:45] right because we are his people chosen
[36:48] of him to be who we
[36:51] are and there was in case you miss it
[36:55] and all I've tried to say there was some
[36:57] about you and I that God
[37:02] liked right you know right and that
[37:05] would move him toward
[37:08] us but then his calling would move us
[37:10] toward him right amen you know and I
[37:13] believe that I believe there's something
[37:14] about an
[37:16] individual an ability to believe maybe
[37:19] what was the difference in Abraham and
[37:20] anybody else that was in the world as
[37:22] far as a man he was just a man that's
[37:25] like everybody else but you know what he
[37:27] believed God sir when God said something
[37:30] he didn't have the Holy Ghost to believe
[37:33] with he had only his human ability with
[37:37] an anointing of
[37:39] God to be able to believe and he
[37:41] believed him right well you know and and
[37:45] see he had to believe when it looked
[37:48] impossible that's
[37:50] right and see that's why he's the father
[37:53] of
[37:55] faith is because he could believe a
[37:58] human mortal could believe God well if
[38:02] he could do that without the baptism of
[38:04] the Holy Ghost why can't you and I with
[38:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost believe
[38:09] him when he says something just believe
[38:11] it and just go forth and confess
[38:15] it and believe it and say thank you Lord
[38:19] it's mine you know and then just March
[38:22] right on down the road thank you Jesus
[38:24] but the main thing is if he tells you
[38:27] something for you to
[38:29] believe
[38:31] remember that he
[38:33] expects you and I to walk in that that
[38:37] he's brought unto
[38:39] us he expects us to you know be what
[38:44] we're supposed to be that's right amen
[38:46] because we're his children that's right
[38:49] we're his offspring you remember the
[38:50] story of the uh the African slave you
[38:54] know that that he was always up and
[38:57] doing his job and even though he was a
[38:59] slave and away from his country he knew
[39:02] he was the son of a
[39:04] king and he still conducted himself that
[39:07] way well that's what we need to be and
[39:10] all like that we were talking kind of
[39:12] that line coming home last night
[39:14] that you know people are watching you
[39:17] and I to see we can make a great
[39:20] confession with our mouth we can expound
[39:23] upon the scriptures and confound the
[39:26] wise our children could tell the
[39:29] scholars and things things about the
[39:31] Bible that they don't even
[39:34] know but then are we going to say out of
[39:37] one side of our mouth something you know
[39:41] and not live that you remember I brought
[39:44] out that emphasized it that a fountain
[39:48] can't bring forth bitter and
[39:51] sweet it's going to be one or the other
[39:54] cuz it cannot do it and just remember
[39:57] we're not deceiving no
[40:00] one but
[40:03] ourselves you
[40:05] know in in our doing so just remember
[40:07] that see because I give all the praise
[40:10] the honor and
[40:11] glory to God Almighty for revealing his
[40:15] word to you and
[40:16] I I do that I hold that always have
[40:21] always pray Lord use me no matter what
[40:26] just use me toak bring your word no
[40:29] matter what I am and brother randam was
[40:32] talking about even uh Isaiah he's was
[40:36] talking about I was reading it the other
[40:38] day about how that he was just a man and
[40:40] just and said had faults and failures
[40:42] just like you and I have I said God
[40:45] chose him to write the word
[40:49] well you know why can't we believe it
[40:51] and be what we are okay let's cover a
[40:53] few things and then we'll get on to
[40:56] comments and questions and then carry on
[40:59] uh the word of the Lord remember brother
[41:01] forny will be with us on February the
[41:04] 5th which is a Wednesday preaching for
[41:06] us all
[41:08] right now I just tell you what I believe
[41:11] because that's the way I've always
[41:14] been when the prophet of God said we
[41:16] came here with his seed in us I believe
[41:20] that I just don't believe it maybe like
[41:22] everybody else seem or you know what a
[41:24] lot of people seem to
[41:26] believe
[41:28] I believe it was a seat of
[41:31] representation from
[41:33] predestination that even the little
[41:35] woman at the well there you know that's
[41:37] what she had she had
[41:40] representation and her representation
[41:43] was that she
[41:47] believed she
[41:51] believed her mother told her about these
[41:53] things she believed it her preacher told
[41:56] her about about you heard the little
[41:58] woman at well she said we know when the
[42:01] Messiah cometh so they were studying the
[42:03] scriptures looking
[42:06] forward to the coming of the
[42:09] Messiah right and that was quickened to
[42:11] her that he was the
[42:14] Messiah but that didn't give her eternal
[42:18] life he so the seed was quick and dinner
[42:21] well amen but it was a seed of
[42:25] what we know when the Messiah
[42:29] cometh I said about Moses it was Quicken
[42:32] to Moses at the burning bush that he was
[42:36] the
[42:37] deliverer
[42:38] amen that he was the one to go then all
[42:42] of his mama
[42:44] said came alive in his
[42:47] heart but he heard it from
[42:51] her all through the scriptures then you
[42:53] find them people believing it Mary
[42:58] believing of Isaiah
[43:00] 9 you know there a virgin shall
[43:04] conceive she believed that and when the
[43:08] angel began to talk to her about it she
[43:10] was well acquainted with that
[43:13] scripture her mother had taught her
[43:15] those
[43:17] things then she could say be it unto me
[43:19] according to Thy
[43:21] word
[43:23] because see I've tried my best to
[43:25] explain to you what is the seed of God
[43:28] God the seed of God is the revealed word
[43:33] for the hour that you're living go
[43:37] remember it's not the person 154 Church
[43:41] age book it's not the person that comes
[43:44] from God predestinated eternally
[43:47] amen it's the word are
[43:51] seed all right so then everything out
[43:54] here in the
[43:56] natural
[43:58] is purely the forn knowledge of God
[44:01] right if not what kind of a god do you
[44:04] have if he's not
[44:07] infinite all right then he could write
[44:09] in his
[44:11] word he could write it down he could
[44:15] speak of
[44:18] things that would be 6,000
[44:21] years before they would
[44:26] transpire but see we want to try to pull
[44:28] us into a
[44:29] bracket or something to make us
[44:32] something super
[44:37] religious I believe
[44:39] that as I said a moment ago I don't
[44:42] believe there's anything on the earth
[44:43] greater than the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:46] am that's that's a wonderful
[44:50] position that's the that's the son of a
[44:54] king that we could live and be that
[44:59] but you see at the same time he saw you
[45:01] and
[45:02] I he saw by his for knowledge what
[45:06] everybody else would
[45:08] do
[45:10] right he saw
[45:13] the foolish
[45:16] virgins would receive eternal life one
[45:20] day right he wrote about him in the word
[45:23] Matthew
[45:25] 25 he spoke of a sealed
[45:29] Jew people that would be given eternal
[45:34] life he spoke of 144,000 he spoke of a
[45:37] lot beside of you and
[45:42] I that would be given eternal life as
[45:45] far as he's concerned you already saw it
[45:48] you know the one scripture that you got
[45:50] to let it be divided by the prophet you
[45:53] know the scripture says enter in the joy
[45:57] voice of the Lord prepared for thee
[46:00] before the foundation of the
[46:04] world you know that's the bride all
[46:07] right but it's also got to be applied to
[46:11] the foolish virgins the Jews
[46:14] Etc you said well was a place provided
[46:17] for them well that's what he
[46:21] said because where the scriptures plac
[46:24] especially like Revelation 7 you're
[46:27] going on over there where the the Jews
[46:29] are
[46:31] at and see everything was made
[46:34] ready but the most wonderful part of it
[46:37] was to me
[46:40] now had it never been a
[46:46] fall then would those people have come
[46:50] into
[46:51] being that are going to be given eternal
[46:55] life or would have only
[46:57] been you and
[46:59] I as his
[47:02] offspring see they're going to say if
[47:05] you hadn't to
[47:07] come we wouldn't be
[47:09] here we're talking about a cup of water
[47:12] in thy
[47:14] name now that's not somebody say oh I'm
[47:17] going to make sure I'm good to them
[47:19] people cuz I can get you turn l no it's
[47:21] not that way no it's when it's done from
[47:25] a heart
[47:27] of just I'm going to do it you know
[47:31] somebody you have a flat tire somebody
[47:33] stop Happ you change the tire right they
[47:37] can get eternal
[47:39] life that's a wonderful thing
[47:43] right and why can't we believe
[47:47] it but you see I
[47:51] believe to have eternal life inside of
[47:55] here I have to be born again that's
[48:00] right I don't believe I came with the
[48:03] eternal life in
[48:04] me if I did as I st many times Jesus
[48:08] Christ never had to die right that's
[48:10] right he died in
[48:13] vain no but you
[48:17] see that
[48:19] seed then God looked down
[48:23] through and we'll cover more in some
[48:26] other m mes I know on
[48:28] it already the thoughts are there that
[48:31] you know there was a predestinated seed
[48:33] forever age that's right I believe that
[48:38] when Luther caught that of the just
[48:39] shall live by faith that wasn't an
[48:42] accident that wasn't somebody just
[48:44] reading the
[48:45] Bible Well I didn't know it said
[48:49] that no he had read it and read it and
[48:52] read it and read
[48:54] it spoke on it probably heard of others
[48:57] speak on it there were a lot of people
[48:59] protested the Catholic Church before
[49:01] Martin
[49:02] Luther right but they were
[49:05] not the
[49:07] predestinated
[49:09] seed to bring forth
[49:12] right so it didn't
[49:15] work but Luther it
[49:19] did but you understand
[49:23] then brother R said the seed was put
[49:25] there what Christ the mystery God
[49:29] revealed it was put there before the
[49:31] foundation of the
[49:34] world then that can only be in God's
[49:37] mind or else you have a
[49:42] pre-existence I believe in pre-existence
[49:45] of eternal
[49:46] life I don't believe in pre-existence of
[49:51] people I believe in pre-existence of God
[49:55] Amen
[49:57] and I believe that there was a
[49:59] time that he dwelt
[50:02] alone then where were you and I at
[50:07] then if he dwelt
[50:11] alone we would have to be a part of
[50:16] him the only thing then I can credit
[50:18] with being back
[50:21] dire before the
[50:24] world or credit to be a part of him
[50:29] is the fact that I have eternal
[50:33] life because he the only one
[50:38] Eternal see we used to believe there was
[50:40] two eternals you know
[50:42] what brother was bringing out last night
[50:44] I enjoyed it we you know we used to
[50:46] believe there's two
[50:47] eternals we believe we had eternal life
[50:50] and we believe there was going to be
[50:51] people in Hell
[50:53] Eternal you remember
[50:55] that we believed in two Eternal lives
[50:59] whether we want to agree with or
[51:01] not but you see then church I only
[51:05] believe that there's one eternal life
[51:08] right and if I have eternal
[51:11] life then that eternal life always
[51:16] was and always will be
[51:21] Eternal amen amen and that it's a part
[51:24] of God that would be to where that it
[51:27] would make
[51:29] me his offspring not this body here not
[51:33] this physical part this is the part I'm
[51:36] riding in but would make me that's
[51:39] inside of
[51:41] here an eternal
[51:43] God you said God well that's what the
[51:47] scripture says it makes them gods do
[51:49] whom the word come
[51:51] to he said yeah but how you going to
[51:54] tell well Jesus was a mortal being right
[51:57] the body was a mortal
[51:59] being right and
[52:05] died but he was raised up and made
[52:08] Eternal and the Bible said we'll have a
[52:10] body like under his glorious
[52:13] body so are we going to just stay IM
[52:16] mortal people
[52:18] no we're going to be an immortal
[52:21] people by chain that will come upon
[52:25] us
[52:28] and make us his children his
[52:32] offspring and if I'm a part of
[52:36] God not this but inside of
[52:40] here then I can
[52:43] believe the
[52:46] impossible sir you need that quote
[52:48] brother said God believes the impossible
[52:53] amen amen and if he's in you you'll
[52:55] believe it that's
[52:59] right CU it's not I Jesus said it's the
[53:02] father that dwelleth in
[53:04] me so it's not I it's not you it's the
[53:09] god that dwells in
[53:13] us that's what makes us his
[53:15] offspring you remember in one of the
[53:17] messages we picked it up see the real
[53:22] you who is the real
[53:25] you
[53:29] that
[53:30] person that can stand here with eternal
[53:34] life in their
[53:36] soul by the new birth that they've
[53:38] received that part of you in there is
[53:42] the real
[53:43] you this is just a
[53:46] tabernacle that I dwell
[53:49] in but one day it will be made La un to
[53:52] what's inside of it or
[53:55] eternal
[53:58] and when it is there's the real
[54:00] you the real you that would have come
[54:03] had it been no
[54:05] fall come on read spoken words Original
[54:08] Seed I'm pretty sure it's in there he
[54:11] said being born by word and spirit
[54:14] brings us back to the original like we
[54:17] should have been amen and did not been a
[54:23] fall wonderful message that we received
[54:30] amen see then the scripture
[54:34] says as we read this morning in
[54:37] Ephesians that we were chosen in
[54:41] him not just chosen off him that would
[54:43] make it a different situation totally to
[54:47] be chosen off him would be like you pick
[54:49] up sides you know I'll take this side
[54:50] and I'll do one over here one over here
[54:52] I one here one that's what we look at is
[54:55] choosing
[54:57] but no it doesn't say choosing it says
[55:01] we were
[55:03] chosen
[55:05] were before the foundation of the
[55:08] world where in him that's right all
[55:13] right then when he
[55:16] came here we were in
[55:20] him is that
[55:22] right not our fleshly beings not the
[55:25] person you're you're looking at that's
[55:28] right not even the Body Spirit soul of
[55:31] this man as a Samuel
[55:35] Dale but the eternal life that I have
[55:39] within
[55:40] me was a part of
[55:43] him and when he was chosen you and I
[55:46] were chosen amen so when he was
[55:51] predestinated now come on you truly
[55:53] believe he was around I was looking at
[55:57] I finally just took my notes I said I
[55:59] forget it I had them piled my wife
[56:01] wouldn't even touch them I had my whole
[56:03] desk just pile full of quotes I finally
[56:06] yesterday just took them everyone and
[56:08] said I'm going through this today and
[56:11] get through with it and then we'll go on
[56:13] and I throw it away
[56:15] probably two 200 pages of quotes I guess
[56:20] close to it it say 100
[56:22] anyway and someone just put these away
[56:27] and we'll start from
[56:29] here you see I could have read it out
[56:31] and run on with it for 6 months still
[56:34] preaching on it and you know that
[56:37] but I chose to stop and then come back
[56:40] and just pick things for us to be able
[56:43] to follow along and and see cuz I want
[56:46] us to realize who we
[56:48] are you know you've heard me say many
[56:52] times I don't want my kids to be called
[56:54] a migil huies
[56:58] that wouldn't be my
[57:02] kids my kids are called Al you all
[57:07] right why because they're my
[57:12] Offspring see by the beding ground
[57:14] through the
[57:15] wife it is your that's what she's for
[57:18] she's to help you reproduce yourself
[57:22] because the germ comes from the
[57:25] male
[57:26] but without the female there ain't going
[57:29] to be no babies
[57:33] born sister Freda was telling us last
[57:36] night that the doctors told or the
[57:37] people in school told her that a man
[57:40] could carry a baby if they put the egg
[57:43] and sperm into his intestines or
[57:45] somewhere in his stomach or something
[57:49] whatever his abdomen abdomen okay
[57:52] abdomen I said they'll never put me to
[57:55] sleep again
[58:00] never have it Danny ain't going to put
[58:01] me to sleep again and if you go I'm
[58:04] going to be standing there but we ain't
[58:07] going to get this thing
[58:09] started you
[58:10] know remember they made a movie one time
[58:13] I didn't see it but I heard about it's a
[58:14] half pragnant man well I wonder what the
[58:16] other half was but
[58:20] listen do you believe brother random was
[58:23] saying about the uh the little woman I
[58:26] see how was the one coming across the
[58:27] desert and all he said she was
[58:32] predestinated well see I believe in
[58:37] predestination I believe everything in
[58:40] the
[58:41] world by for
[58:45] knowledge God predetermined it that he
[58:48] didn't have to think it over as it came
[58:50] down
[58:51] through he already knew so we could
[58:54] already write it down
[58:56] mhm that's
[58:58] right he could write down that Paul was
[59:01] going to be
[59:03] Saul you
[59:05] know and then he was going to turn into
[59:08] Paul he could write that down because he
[59:11] was almighty God that's right so then
[59:14] predestination to me is very
[59:16] simple it means god looked down through
[59:19] Saul said that's it that's what it's
[59:21] going to
[59:23] be all right
[59:26] see then get to point of listening then
[59:28] we'll get down to you get
[59:30] to if we were chosen in him and not of
[59:34] him in him all
[59:37] right then we were
[59:40] predestinated when he was
[59:45] predestinated you believe he was
[59:47] predestinated yes if you don't you sure
[59:51] got a lot of
[59:52] problems we surely do need about six
[59:54] more months on this if you don't believe
[59:57] Jesus Christ was
[1:00:01] predestinated what about being able to
[1:00:03] live through
[1:00:06] life now I'm honest I've always tried to
[1:00:09] tell you what I
[1:00:11] think I don't think Jesus because of him
[1:00:14] being connected to the Flesh and the way
[1:00:16] he was he didn't know
[1:00:20] everything because come on now he didn't
[1:00:23] know when he's coming back
[1:00:24] so you do argue all you want to yeah but
[1:00:28] he was God well that's all right God's
[1:00:30] in you do you know
[1:00:33] everything but yet he would come
[1:00:37] along and when he came along one day it
[1:00:41] was quickened to
[1:00:42] him he read the scripture of Isaiah
[1:00:48] 61 that's
[1:00:51] right and he seen Isaiah 61 was right
[1:00:56] there in his own
[1:00:58] life and he said this
[1:01:01] day this scripture is filled right
[1:01:06] amen but you think about it by him
[1:01:09] knowing
[1:01:11] that he knew also the horrible death
[1:01:16] that he would
[1:01:19] die because David had already in the
[1:01:21] spirit spoke of him as looking as a
[1:01:23] prophet called it l like a piece of
[1:01:24] hamburger meat
[1:01:27] you know shredded to
[1:01:30] pieces you
[1:01:32] know he knew what would
[1:01:35] happen what about knowing all of
[1:01:40] that and
[1:01:42] yet he never went around well tell you
[1:01:46] want
[1:01:47] wyny say Wy Wy
[1:01:52] wooy I've got a problem I got to be God
[1:01:55] again
[1:01:57] yes
[1:02:02] no he endured the cross the Bible
[1:02:05] says what
[1:02:08] far for you and
[1:02:12] I
[1:02:14] right so when he was chosen we were
[1:02:17] chosen when he was predestinated and it
[1:02:20] said there would be a lamb slain before
[1:02:22] the foundation of the
[1:02:24] world that wase determined to come into
[1:02:27] view one
[1:02:31] day but at the same time he was
[1:02:34] predetermined to be
[1:02:37] crucified why would he be
[1:02:41] crucified because it was
[1:02:43] predetermined that there would be a
[1:02:46] people who would desire salvation right
[1:02:54] amen do you follow it
[1:02:56] or else he couldn't be be predetermined
[1:02:58] to die if he's predetermined to die
[1:03:01] there was a reason for his dying
[1:03:07] right you and I would not be in
[1:03:09] existence in any form without him that's
[1:03:12] right right cuz surely by now that it is
[1:03:15] to blow the whole thing away that's
[1:03:19] right but yet he keeps
[1:03:21] it to that
[1:03:23] day you know they actually said I
[1:03:26] remember
[1:03:27] reading that when
[1:03:30] uh Einstein split the
[1:03:34] Adam he missed it by a h of the correct
[1:03:41] thing and if he'd hit that correctly it
[1:03:44] Blow the whole world up once they set it
[1:03:47] off that's how
[1:03:50] close just a higher
[1:03:53] off from as we'd call it dead center or
[1:03:56] whatever you'd want to do the
[1:03:59] terminologies it would have blowed the
[1:04:01] whole world to
[1:04:03] pieces now you know
[1:04:05] what the atom bomb is just a cap
[1:04:10] designator every how you say that word
[1:04:12] you know the thing that sets off you
[1:04:15] know what a cap is sets off a dynamite
[1:04:18] it's just a cap for the hydrogen
[1:04:21] bomb and the hydrogen bomb was in the '
[1:04:24] 50s I after the Adam Bomb in the
[1:04:29] 40s what have they got
[1:04:33] now they can zap you totally out of
[1:04:40] being what you see it was
[1:04:44] predestinated that there'd be a people
[1:04:47] in this
[1:04:48] day that would believe this
[1:04:53] message right
[1:04:57] predetermined that would be the seat of
[1:05:01] God I just get the
[1:05:05] opportunity to believe I can be one of
[1:05:12] them we talk
[1:05:15] about being you know born again well all
[1:05:19] right but in this age it's not just
[1:05:21] predestinated to a new
[1:05:24] birth it's predestinated on into to
[1:05:28] adoption on into to a change of the body
[1:05:34] amen you know what's keeping off the
[1:05:36] change of the
[1:05:38] body your Prophet said you and I that's
[1:05:41] right that's right right you need that
[1:05:44] quote he said you're an hour keeping it
[1:05:47] from
[1:05:48] happening
[1:05:50] why because we're not believing
[1:05:53] correctly Who We Are
[1:05:56] right oh yeah we're
[1:05:57] believing you right over
[1:06:00] here to this church right across over
[1:06:02] here and they're preaching about they
[1:06:05] believe who they
[1:06:06] are they're reading the same book you
[1:06:11] read and they're claiming to be The
[1:06:13] Offspring of
[1:06:15] God what's the
[1:06:18] difference well they don't believe the
[1:06:20] message is hour
[1:06:24] well like brother brother said he
[1:06:27] said who
[1:06:29] knows Jacqueline Kennedy you remember he
[1:06:33] talking about the Waterhead ha cutter I
[1:06:35] mean h do or whatever he called
[1:06:37] her he said if she'd have heard the
[1:06:46] message right might be a
[1:06:50] difference but the problem is church we
[1:06:52] have heard the message that's right amen
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:56] now what are we going to do with
[1:06:59] it I wasn't joking when I said we'd have
[1:07:02] the next it won't be long until we've
[1:07:04] been having Fellowship meetings in the
[1:07:06] nursing
[1:07:08] home right right and a lot of us sitting
[1:07:12] here that's close to
[1:07:20] it kids had already said they're riding
[1:07:22] up down terance especially riding up
[1:07:24] down the road trying to find a good one
[1:07:26] for us I don't know where he's trying to
[1:07:27] find a good one or the cheapest one I
[1:07:29] haven't figured it out
[1:07:32] yet or the goodest one that's the
[1:07:35] cheapest you
[1:07:38] know but it's no joke
[1:07:41] really we're one
[1:07:44] breath that's right from any kind of a
[1:07:48] problem that it could
[1:07:51] exist
[1:07:54] right disease is coming on the earth now
[1:07:57] that they don't know what to
[1:08:02] do they don't know what they they don't
[1:08:04] even know what they are now wasn't that
[1:08:07] what the prophet
[1:08:08] said he said one day cancer will be like
[1:08:13] a
[1:08:18] toothache and look what they're
[1:08:20] doing just
[1:08:22] experimenting someone we talking last
[1:08:25] night about
[1:08:27] this lady or girl or something that they
[1:08:31] gave her a flu
[1:08:34] shot and now it's just thred her into
[1:08:37] all kind of
[1:08:39] things she can't walk forward they don't
[1:08:42] understand but she can walk
[1:08:44] backward all kind of things is wrong
[1:08:46] just because of a little
[1:08:50] shot that you know you said well I took
[1:08:54] one of them should I be worried
[1:08:55] are you walking backwards or
[1:08:59] forward okay you start walking backwards
[1:09:02] and can't walk forward I would suggest
[1:09:04] going to the
[1:09:05] doctor Brother D you're crazy I agree
[1:09:08] with you but that's just the way I live
[1:09:11] folks I live with no
[1:09:15] fear no
[1:09:18] thoughts of what can
[1:09:24] come because you know
[1:09:27] what it will
[1:09:31] come that
[1:09:33] God
[1:09:36] predestinated by his full knowledge just
[1:09:39] as well as anything
[1:09:42] else yeah but through all this 36 you
[1:09:44] just had made me feel
[1:09:51] uplifted I'm
[1:09:54] sorry I tried because I'm trying my best
[1:09:58] get you to see and me to see what God
[1:10:01] thinks about
[1:10:05] us he spoke there in Revelation and said
[1:10:09] and his
[1:10:11] wife he calls her bride and what brother
[1:10:13] R said I'll call you bride he talks of a
[1:10:17] bride talks of a girlfriend Revelation
[1:10:21] he said and the wife has made herself
[1:10:23] ready amen that's
[1:10:29] right I've never tried to be but one
[1:10:32] thing and that's try to preach
[1:10:36] whatever
[1:10:37] that I believe was needful for the
[1:10:41] time to try to help us and get us
[1:10:46] prepared because I've believed since
[1:10:49] brother Mo preached the statute of
[1:10:50] perfect man there in 71 or two in there
[1:10:54] in both years and I asked him I said
[1:10:58] brother mod all I want to know is how do
[1:11:00] I get these
[1:11:02] virtues well it was about 1980 the Lord
[1:11:05] spoke to me and
[1:11:08] said it can only be brought by the
[1:11:11] revealed
[1:11:14] word you you can't practice to get
[1:11:18] Faith you you can't uh beat each other
[1:11:21] to get patience or temper is or
[1:11:27] anything it can only be by the revealed
[1:11:32] word and see then I gave you the quotes
[1:11:34] while we're in the series of it that or
[1:11:36] gave you the quote there
[1:11:38] especially that these young ministers he
[1:11:40] said would sweep this on to the coming
[1:11:42] of the
[1:11:43] Lord I didn't say
[1:11:46] that I didn't say in the stature of a
[1:11:48] perfect man
[1:11:50] that it take a fivefold
[1:11:52] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[1:11:55] Saints for the bringing of these virtues
[1:11:58] into the
[1:12:01] people I didn't write
[1:12:04] that but I believe it amen cuz you see I
[1:12:08] have to
[1:12:09] have a
[1:12:13] pastor well you mean preachers got have
[1:12:17] pastors he he's the first one's going to
[1:12:19] be looking for
[1:12:21] one because you're depending on somebody
[1:12:24] to try to help
[1:12:27] you you say yeah but but it don't make
[1:12:30] no
[1:12:31] difference brother wouldbe used to have
[1:12:33] a good point it really was good he said
[1:12:35] a little woman with the Holy Ghost can
[1:12:36] help you if you'll listen to
[1:12:45] her what will it be who'll be the first
[1:12:48] one what kind of questions thoughts
[1:12:51] comments but make sure that you you know
[1:12:54] we will try to cut it as slow as we can
[1:12:56] and keep it into the line and you'll
[1:12:58] have to get us a a microphone or
[1:13:02] something to take to the people and you
[1:13:07] know who be first who's got a question
[1:13:12] don't
[1:13:18] comment sister sister Anna Romans
[1:13:23] 82932 those who he forew he also did
[1:13:27] predestinate to be conformed did God for
[1:13:30] know everyone and everything in the
[1:13:32] world and if so it means he forew
[1:13:37] Sinners too and did he predestinate
[1:13:40] Sinners to Eternal
[1:13:44] damnation all
[1:13:46] right he knowed all
[1:13:49] things he knew who would be saved and
[1:13:51] who wouldn't be saved uh by him knowing
[1:13:56] who would be saved who would want to be
[1:13:58] saved and who wouldn't want to be saved
[1:14:00] now uh there ain't nobody in the world
[1:14:02] let me let me straighten that part up
[1:14:04] just in a hurry there ain't nobody in
[1:14:06] the world that tell you they don't want
[1:14:07] to be saved you you understand that's
[1:14:09] just
[1:14:11] wordings it's not something that don't
[1:14:13] want to be saved it's some reason that
[1:14:16] for them not wanting you know not
[1:14:18] accepting what you bring all right so
[1:14:20] everybody is predestinated by God's
[1:14:23] fulln knowledge
[1:14:26] but nobody is predestinated by his
[1:14:28] predetermining Factor without giving him
[1:14:31] a choice that's
[1:14:36] right even as we would talk about
[1:14:38] someone in a foreign country um hot and
[1:14:41] toot back in the jungle
[1:14:43] somewhere I'm so glad the prophet came
[1:14:46] to show us those things he said they'll
[1:14:48] be judged according to the laws of their
[1:14:51] own tribe that's
[1:14:53] right ain't that something
[1:14:56] something God knew that nobody would
[1:14:59] ever be able to take the word to them
[1:15:03] right you
[1:15:05] know he would judge them about how they
[1:15:07] live by their own tribes rules that's
[1:15:09] right and he said that's why you see
[1:15:12] there's not
[1:15:14] any venial diseases now this is way back
[1:15:18] right veneral diseases developed in a
[1:15:20] lot of countries because of um sorry say
[1:15:26] uh from
[1:15:31] monkeys in other words women receiving
[1:15:34] animals and that order to show you it
[1:15:36] started in there but that was Vanilla
[1:15:37] diseases in a lot of the foreign
[1:15:41] countries when brother Brandon was there
[1:15:43] he didn't see
[1:15:45] anything why because they were good
[1:15:49] people they lived according to a code of
[1:15:52] ethics we would call
[1:15:53] it to be good
[1:15:56] people it's the moral obligation of any
[1:15:59] human being no matter who to be good and
[1:16:04] to want to serve
[1:16:06] God so he never made nobody
[1:16:10] lost but he knew who would be and who
[1:16:14] wouldn't is that what you're talking
[1:16:16] about okay that clear it up like sister
[1:16:20] said today something she said Brother D
[1:16:23] I saw something there like I said it was
[1:16:25] as clear as mud she started laughing cuz
[1:16:27] she'd never heard that saying that's
[1:16:29] saying with us around here you know
[1:16:32] somebody one time said I said is that
[1:16:34] clear he said well it's clear as
[1:16:38] mud which mean he didn't fully
[1:16:40] understand it but you know what to do
[1:16:43] all right who'll be
[1:16:45] next somebody make a comment about what
[1:16:47] you
[1:16:48] believe sister Trudy in the back behind
[1:16:52] sister
[1:16:53] Trudy
[1:17:01] um I just want to try to see if I
[1:17:05] understand what you have been preaching
[1:17:06] all this
[1:17:07] time now when we talk about the woman at
[1:17:10] the
[1:17:10] well and we said that her seed came
[1:17:13] alive or her seed was quickened I
[1:17:16] understand that she didn't receive the
[1:17:17] new bread because she was talking to the
[1:17:19] Messiah at that point in time now is
[1:17:22] that seed the revelation of who she was
[1:17:25] talking to and then it was leading up to
[1:17:28] her
[1:17:29] receiving the new birth and does that
[1:17:32] same thing applies to Mary cuz they both
[1:17:35] like you said they both heard the word
[1:17:37] right so it was God's predestinated
[1:17:42] thought then it became their thought
[1:17:44] because they heard it mhm and when it
[1:17:47] was in front of them they accepted
[1:17:50] it okay so
[1:17:53] that's basically what you you were
[1:17:55] saying right okay now coming down
[1:17:59] to our
[1:18:01] time or yeah our time we pass
[1:18:05] Calvary so the same process applies for
[1:18:10] us um is just
[1:18:14] that the new birth is what we will
[1:18:17] receive once we have that revelation of
[1:18:19] who Jesus Christ is and who we are so
[1:18:22] it's like a moving a progressing
[1:18:25] exactly okay cuz see I I believe that
[1:18:29] you need to know who he is before you
[1:18:32] can know anything about a new birth
[1:18:34] right so at that time when we get or let
[1:18:37] me say when I have that revelation of
[1:18:40] who he
[1:18:42] is and it became my thought after I
[1:18:48] confess it that is the quickening word
[1:18:51] or the the seed exactly God seed okay
[1:18:55] that's Romans see where with the heart
[1:18:57] you believe the mouth you
[1:19:00] confess okay you got to believe it
[1:19:03] confess but how can you believe
[1:19:05] something that you don't know anything
[1:19:06] about see so you well stated it the
[1:19:09] woman at the wh her knowledge was of who
[1:19:12] he was he was the
[1:19:16] Messiah he did not birth that into her
[1:19:19] as to give her the Holy
[1:19:21] Ghost but you know what that took her to
[1:19:24] the day she received the new
[1:19:29] birth that took her to Upper Room as we
[1:19:32] call
[1:19:33] it and then she received eternal life go
[1:19:37] that way Faith first comes by
[1:19:40] hearing you must hear
[1:19:42] it you must believe it the disciples it
[1:19:45] speaks of them in The Parables and it
[1:19:47] speaks of them it says and they took the
[1:19:48] word and held
[1:19:53] it it emphasizes they held it cuz some
[1:19:56] was scattered on ground thorns and
[1:19:58] thistles and rocks and but some of them
[1:20:01] took them took it and held
[1:20:03] it they said to Jesus one day he said
[1:20:06] what we don't
[1:20:08] know why don't you go to he said that 7
[1:20:11] left they said well we don't know where
[1:20:14] to
[1:20:15] go cuz thou Hast the words of eternal
[1:20:18] life you're the only one that's got a
[1:20:19] message worth fooling
[1:20:22] with and we don't understand but we
[1:20:24] might as well to stay
[1:20:26] here right right I have one more
[1:20:30] question okay
[1:20:32] um does representation leads to
[1:20:36] Redemption because like the woman that
[1:20:37] the well she had a knowledge she had
[1:20:40] something there represent and say hey
[1:20:42] this is what I recognize and I will
[1:20:44] stand by what I heard so that leads to
[1:20:48] redemption or exactly okay because your
[1:20:52] representation you must have that first
[1:20:55] right before you could even speak of
[1:20:57] being
[1:20:59] redeemed I mean you can't even cover
[1:21:01] being redeemed Until you realize you
[1:21:04] know what you're redeemed from and how
[1:21:07] you're redeemed and what it takes
[1:21:09] place that you must be born again and
[1:21:12] the soul is
[1:21:13] redeemed but it's not the finish of all
[1:21:15] of
[1:21:16] it so then to just
[1:21:19] say you know I always was so I'm
[1:21:23] redeemed
[1:21:27] no is a
[1:21:29] revelation everything we get from God
[1:21:31] must come by faith you agree with that a
[1:21:35] revelation from God that's right so you
[1:21:38] can carry
[1:21:39] it all you want
[1:21:42] to you can read this book all you want
[1:21:45] to until it's revealed like sister f I
[1:21:49] think was talking about last night she
[1:21:50] was explaining serpent seed or something
[1:21:52] to somebody and it was made a to her
[1:21:55] what she was explaining you ever had
[1:21:58] that you're explaining it you know and
[1:22:02] all that once is Made Alive you wow you
[1:22:07] know but it's got to be made known it's
[1:22:09] got to be revealed and for it to be
[1:22:11] revealed means God's got to speak to you
[1:22:14] first of
[1:22:17] thought now you let Satan come and take
[1:22:20] that thought and twist
[1:22:23] it he can can't birth that thought even
[1:22:26] though he brought
[1:22:28] it everybody understand that point he
[1:22:31] can't birth something that you let be
[1:22:33] perverted in your thinking that's right
[1:22:36] he would be quickening a lie wrong thing
[1:22:39] so when you read something believe it
[1:22:41] that's
[1:22:44] right he was wounded for our
[1:22:45] transgression bruised for our iniquity
[1:22:48] by stripes we are
[1:22:50] healed you know what I believe that you
[1:22:54] know what I believe you want thus sayith
[1:22:56] the
[1:22:57] Lord that's what it says thus sayth the
[1:23:01] Lord he was wounded for our
[1:23:02] transgression bruised for our iniquity
[1:23:05] by Stripes from heal come on that's
[1:23:08] him but if that's not revealed I'll stay
[1:23:14] sick and even sometimes when it's
[1:23:17] revealed I don't immediately
[1:23:20] receive what I'm
[1:23:22] confessing you agree with that amen I've
[1:23:25] got to confess it let him do it anything
[1:23:27] else that's it okay who'll be
[1:23:31] next sister hand it up to Sister
[1:23:36] Trudy we got two Trudy
[1:23:39] so I don't like they do it around here
[1:23:42] they say black Trudy white Trudy well
[1:23:44] that they're okay with it but you know
[1:23:48] it's Trudy Mac and Trudy T yeah um Anna
[1:23:54] had mentioned something last week I
[1:23:56] think it was and I don't know that she
[1:23:58] ever said anything to you but it's
[1:24:00] perfect uh these people who say that
[1:24:02] they came here with something in them
[1:24:05] and they feel they were always Eternal
[1:24:08] then they should always be healed yeah
[1:24:11] that was the point she brought out so
[1:24:13] good point the sick ones it's all so so
[1:24:17] we know who the sick ones are or
[1:24:19] something how they pronounce that word
[1:24:20] Zozo or something like that which means
[1:24:22] redeemed physically or redeemed spirit
[1:24:24] save physically or sa and if you if you
[1:24:28] always was eternal then why are you sick
[1:24:31] that's
[1:24:31] right so evidently Jesus's body
[1:24:35] wasn't Eternal that's right cuz he is
[1:24:39] sick right he Gran with a
[1:24:43] headache right see his body was not
[1:24:46] Eternal it was made Eternal in the
[1:24:51] resurrection because it was a creation
[1:24:53] you can't create anything
[1:24:56] Eternal he never created eternal
[1:25:00] life brother Dale God created no he
[1:25:04] didn't create eternal life eternal life
[1:25:07] is the
[1:25:11] creator he's the Creator go
[1:25:15] ahead I had a a verse that I wanted to
[1:25:18] ask a question about it's uh
[1:25:20] Hebrews uh 1113 but to which of the the
[1:25:24] angel said he at any time sit on my
[1:25:26] right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:25:28] thy foot stol are they not all
[1:25:31] ministering Spirits sent forth to
[1:25:33] minister for them who shall be Heirs of
[1:25:37] Salvation exactly um is that now Paul is
[1:25:42] speaking there back then about us today
[1:25:47] but could
[1:25:48] we we too can include our families that
[1:25:52] are lost now
[1:25:54] not if it's revealed to you yeah okay I
[1:25:59] say that with all respect
[1:26:01] everything if it's revealed to you you
[1:26:04] can say it for your family if it's not
[1:26:06] keep saying it until it's revealed keep
[1:26:09] saying it until it becomes a
[1:26:11] reality but just because you say it I
[1:26:14] got in trouble trying to explain that
[1:26:16] years ago and the Brethren were saying
[1:26:18] you mean to tell me your kids is going
[1:26:19] to be Eternal just because they're your
[1:26:22] kids I said you have missed all in the
[1:26:24] world I've tried my best to explain to
[1:26:28] you I said when God said Wade would be
[1:26:31] saved I said it behind him he gave it
[1:26:38] first I said then I confess what he
[1:26:43] confesses well how do you know the
[1:26:45] difference brother Dale well we find out
[1:26:48] whether it takes place or not
[1:26:53] right we go believe
[1:26:58] it but see the main thing is then what
[1:27:00] do we do we must live our
[1:27:03] confession right if we don't live before
[1:27:06] our kids what we confess how what do we
[1:27:09] want them redeemed
[1:27:11] to we just want them took out of the
[1:27:13] pets of the hell of the world and
[1:27:15] brought up into a little better standard
[1:27:17] of
[1:27:18] life right we want them to quit drugs
[1:27:22] quit drinking quit smoking quit run
[1:27:23] running around quit all we want them
[1:27:25] just to quit that to come up to a
[1:27:27] greater height than life that's not my
[1:27:29] goal for my kids
[1:27:31] right my kids have got a problem cuz I
[1:27:34] got a goal for
[1:27:37] them and until that goal is
[1:27:41] finished they going to have to do it I
[1:27:43] used to tell June even I said I'd look
[1:27:46] at weight in the
[1:27:47] life not laugh like funny
[1:27:50] laugh and look at him and say boy you
[1:27:54] got a hard road but you're
[1:27:59] coming I believe
[1:28:02] it and I confess it then what I do try
[1:28:06] my best to live before them as to show
[1:28:08] them what I want them redeemed too
[1:28:12] right I want them to be brought to work
[1:28:15] that I
[1:28:16] am and then that's a horrible place I
[1:28:21] agree cuz maybe they won't stop where I
[1:28:25] am and they'll go on into Greater
[1:28:30] Heights because I know and realize the
[1:28:32] state I'm in is not too
[1:28:34] good but I just don't want them to quit
[1:28:36] drinking smoking chewing and stuff like
[1:28:38] that Alcoholics Anonymous just send them
[1:28:41] down there that'll take care of it
[1:28:43] they'll work with them and it'll
[1:28:46] work so I get to preaching okay who's
[1:28:51] next s Anna
[1:28:58] this is for last
[1:29:00] Sunday um you said and I saw that you
[1:29:05] can have a revelation without the new
[1:29:07] birth right and I did realized
[1:29:11] Caiaphas
[1:29:13] prophesied um Peter also say thou the
[1:29:18] Christ exactly and people all over the
[1:29:20] world are
[1:29:22] healed what is the difference
[1:29:24] and yet faith is a revelation right and
[1:29:28] the new birth is the re revelation of
[1:29:32] Jesus Christ personally to you right
[1:29:33] what is the difference with all those
[1:29:37] Revelations because one of them is
[1:29:41] a the the the Revelation which is a new
[1:29:44] birth is a
[1:29:47] person it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:29:49] personally to you but it is a person
[1:29:52] it's not just a thought it's a person
[1:29:54] coming and living in you the new birth
[1:29:58] whereas the other one is a
[1:30:00] confession upon the basis of what you
[1:30:02] believe and I looked you know and I
[1:30:05] remember I gave it to other day uh
[1:30:07] looking in your computers faith for the
[1:30:10] time a little woman that when Jesus went
[1:30:12] by I believe when he I'm pretty sure she
[1:30:16] reached out and touched him brother said
[1:30:18] she had faith for the
[1:30:21] time what does that mean
[1:30:25] that meant she got
[1:30:26] healed that didn't mean she got saved
[1:30:30] right that's one I've tried to express
[1:30:32] through this message part that people
[1:30:34] thinks because something was quickened
[1:30:36] to you or it was quickened to you that
[1:30:38] brother R was a prophet that's right
[1:30:40] that you know you're
[1:30:42] saved
[1:30:49] no let me quote the
[1:30:52] Bible have you you received the Holy
[1:30:55] Ghost
[1:30:56] what since it was quickened unto you
[1:30:59] that brother R was a prophet you mind if
[1:31:02] I say it that way because that's the way
[1:31:04] brother Randon was saying
[1:31:07] it he said in other words you say you
[1:31:10] know I believe it he said all
[1:31:14] right but have you received the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost since you
[1:31:22] believed I thought I got it when to
[1:31:24] believe that's a good Baptist
[1:31:26] Doctrine that's not
[1:31:30] scripture
[1:31:37] anymore okay there was a quote we read
[1:31:39] last Sunday that if you are in God's
[1:31:42] thinking that's the only way you can
[1:31:43] have eternal life
[1:31:46] exactly yet God knew everybody exactly
[1:31:50] and they were in his thinking mhm but
[1:31:53] they don't have eternal right so you
[1:31:55] remember when I was in the message there
[1:31:57] I was talking about I said we say uh all
[1:32:00] I want to do is make sure I'm in God's
[1:32:02] thinking Judas was in his
[1:32:05] thinking at the same time Jesus was in
[1:32:07] his thinking as to die on Calvary Judas
[1:32:10] is garrot was in his thinking but that
[1:32:12] didn't give Judas is garrot eternal
[1:32:15] life you remember the point I kept
[1:32:17] trying to make maybe it's a carnal way
[1:32:19] to see it but it's what I believe
[1:32:21] there's a lot of difference in what God
[1:32:23] has thinking of or has thought
[1:32:26] of and to be a part of him his own
[1:32:32] thinking you remember I said I don't
[1:32:34] want to be a thought in God's mind
[1:32:35] because he might have thought of me
[1:32:36] going to
[1:32:38] hell cuz he did of
[1:32:42] Judas but if I'm part of
[1:32:45] him then I have eternal
[1:32:47] life and he can't go to
[1:32:51] hell eternal life can't go it's done
[1:32:54] paid the
[1:32:57] price we see then that's a vast
[1:32:59] difference between saying and that's
[1:33:00] what I emphasizing the little woman
[1:33:02] faith for the
[1:33:05] time around the world today there's
[1:33:08] people being healed
[1:33:10] right you
[1:33:12] know maybe that are not even in
[1:33:17] church brother Brandon said them Jews
[1:33:20] are being healed every day and don't
[1:33:23] even
[1:33:24] believe in Jesus
[1:33:28] Christ what is it
[1:33:31] Faith what simply is faith maybe we need
[1:33:34] a six months discussion of that but what
[1:33:37] simply is
[1:33:39] Faith it starts first by your mental
[1:33:46] believing Abraham didn't have the Holy
[1:33:48] Ghost to believe
[1:33:50] with he mentally believed it
[1:33:56] what I like about God is if you will
[1:33:59] mentally believe something take my
[1:34:03] word he'll come on the scene to
[1:34:07] you now start with Abraham just said I
[1:34:11] believe it but remember something was
[1:34:14] talking to
[1:34:16] him that something that was talking to
[1:34:19] him wound up one day to meet him
[1:34:24] the more contact he had with that person
[1:34:27] the more he realized who that
[1:34:30] was brother rown said that
[1:34:34] voice that I
[1:34:36] heard when I was a little
[1:34:38] boy telling me not to smoke or drink
[1:34:41] it'd be a work for me he said that was
[1:34:44] that same voice the first time he met
[1:34:47] that angel he said I know that
[1:34:52] voice go it was so
[1:34:56] personal faith then starts simply by
[1:34:59] believing the prophet said to right
[1:35:01] mental attitude toward any promise will
[1:35:03] bring it to
[1:35:08] pass Faith he said is so
[1:35:11] simple he said until a prostitute or a
[1:35:14] sinner come across the platform be
[1:35:16] prayed for and be healed he said a true
[1:35:21] sinner prayed for and failed get
[1:35:24] it a true Christian not a true
[1:35:28] Center true Christian fail to get what
[1:35:32] they're asking
[1:35:33] for when a sinner could receive
[1:35:38] it you see why some people will never be
[1:35:42] saved they can't
[1:35:46] believe I told you that man out there
[1:35:48] said oh they didn't told Brother Mo said
[1:35:51] why they didn't go out they didn't go to
[1:35:53] no moon
[1:35:55] they just up up went down out there in
[1:35:57] that desert
[1:35:59] somewhere they didn't go to no moon
[1:36:01] there's no way to convince
[1:36:03] him you remember the one to brother
[1:36:05] randam said I don't believe no matter
[1:36:09] what you
[1:36:10] do what did he say he said it wouldn't
[1:36:13] far
[1:36:15] you you can't
[1:36:20] believe if the right men latitude will
[1:36:22] bring God on their s
[1:36:24] why don't we at least start saying it
[1:36:26] that's right
[1:36:28] that's I live through a lot of things in
[1:36:31] this message and I've lived through a
[1:36:33] lot of churches that and heard this
[1:36:36] preach and you have
[1:36:38] too well let's just confess
[1:36:41] it I agree with that
[1:36:45] 100% but those in that situation they
[1:36:48] started confessing it or no longer
[1:36:52] here
[1:36:54] so it never went on to a
[1:36:57] revelation it's only a head
[1:37:01] knowledge vast difference between the
[1:37:03] head knowledge heart
[1:37:05] knowledge I like what somebody said said
[1:37:08] Lord let that drop about 18 Ines you
[1:37:11] know from up here down into here I wish
[1:37:15] I had down in my heart what is in my
[1:37:21] head it's believing
[1:38:23] steps what you're talking about there in
[1:38:26] Romans
[1:38:29] 8:28 I find that for
[1:38:32] me I want to make it too hard or me too
[1:38:37] sorry or something like I've been told
[1:38:39] all these years by the
[1:38:41] devil but all we've got to
[1:38:44] do is look at what God says we can have
[1:38:48] right get the sin and all out of our
[1:38:50] life get the flu cleaned out and say
[1:38:53] Lord I accept it bring it
[1:38:55] on I I that was the I remember from the
[1:38:59] first time I reckon I ever read statue
[1:39:01] of a perfect man one of the things that
[1:39:04] impressed me the strongest in there was
[1:39:06] brother Brenham says it's God's
[1:39:08] obligation to bring you up through this
[1:39:11] not yours to get up through it it's your
[1:39:13] yours to yield to him but it's his
[1:39:16] responsibility to get you through
[1:39:18] it and I think that's I'm speaking for
[1:39:21] me now not nobody else just me but I
[1:39:24] think we everyone need to guard against
[1:39:28] saying well I'm just not good enough for
[1:39:31] that I'm just not this or I'm not that
[1:39:33] or I'm not the
[1:39:34] other if I made a
[1:39:36] decision to serve Jesus
[1:39:40] Christ and he has accepted my decision
[1:39:43] and given me the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:45] Ghost then there's not a thing there
[1:39:47] that I can't have if I just get right
[1:39:49] before him exactly you just keep
[1:39:52] confessing
[1:39:55] exactly I believe we're going to have to
[1:39:58] say that we're already
[1:40:01] changed and then it can take
[1:40:06] place but not lip service that's what I
[1:40:08] was talking about while to go now minute
[1:40:10] there I heard a lot of people say let's
[1:40:12] go let's just let's just say it the
[1:40:14] prophet said let's say
[1:40:16] it well they never kept leaving their
[1:40:22] confession there only lip
[1:40:25] service who be
[1:40:31] next anybody else comments questions
[1:40:35] thoughts sister
[1:40:40] Freda wait a look
[1:40:42] get we want t on tape because that
[1:40:45] people out you are
[1:40:47] listening
[1:40:49] um when we're born as babies we're born
[1:40:52] with our souls
[1:40:54] yeah okay um brother brandom said that
[1:40:57] we hear from our theophany and brother
[1:40:58] Bram said our soul is our theophany and
[1:41:02] when we receive the Holy Ghost we hear
[1:41:04] from our theophany can you explain I
[1:41:06] mean we're born with that soul and our
[1:41:08] soul is our theophany so how is it I
[1:41:11] mean how do we hear from our
[1:41:13] theophany right so then the word soul
[1:41:19] theophany I tried to express to you as
[1:41:22] much as I know and clear as I could make
[1:41:24] it when a baby's
[1:41:26] born it's born to baby it's Body Spirit
[1:41:29] and soul born in Satan's domain
[1:41:33] lost the soul is there what is that soul
[1:41:38] that is that being or the person of that
[1:41:40] child of what it
[1:41:42] is but by not having eternal life where
[1:41:46] is it
[1:41:48] going the word theophan means the body
[1:41:52] of a deity is the break down the
[1:41:59] definition so then who was on the throne
[1:42:02] in our heart when we were first
[1:42:05] born by being born in Satan's domain
[1:42:08] Satan
[1:42:10] was right not a person there sitting
[1:42:13] there like a
[1:42:16] devil it's our soul our being but the
[1:42:21] nature of it is perverted that's right
[1:42:24] into the wrong thing the wrong way and
[1:42:27] brother Brown said that devil hanging
[1:42:30] there was what caused me not to be saved
[1:42:32] gave it a couple of weeks ago what he
[1:42:35] said that devil sitting there me caused
[1:42:38] me to not be saved when I was 12 years
[1:42:44] old you know he's talking about
[1:42:46] himself so then a sinner anybody has a
[1:42:51] soul right any
[1:42:54] person that has a soul or don't have a
[1:42:56] soul that is a soul that's a better way
[1:42:58] of saying a person is a
[1:43:01] soul the nature of that is going
[1:43:03] downward he
[1:43:06] said and there were souls in prison
[1:43:09] which were in
[1:43:10] hell because they repented
[1:43:13] not see all right so that's your soul
[1:43:19] that's your being the nature of that is
[1:43:21] the devil CU he can't create a
[1:43:24] soul he perverts the nature of the
[1:43:28] soul and makes it of his nature his
[1:43:32] ways but the prophet said then when we
[1:43:35] become born again he said we start
[1:43:38] turning
[1:43:39] upward see now he's using there two
[1:43:43] times that he used theop three times
[1:43:46] that he use theophany as speaking of a
[1:43:50] sinner the rest of the time he's
[1:43:52] speaking of of a upward occurrent you
[1:43:55] know going
[1:43:56] upward and that way when you're born
[1:43:59] again it's not your soul that died
[1:44:02] that's right right or you'd be dead it
[1:44:06] was the nature of it right the thing
[1:44:09] that Satan had perverted you made you
[1:44:12] into a certain nature he said those
[1:44:14] Fallen Angels is hanging around he said
[1:44:17] and they give you a nature what he
[1:44:22] said but then when you're born again
[1:44:25] then you hear
[1:44:27] from that God is drawing you just like
[1:44:31] the statue of a perfect man I believe
[1:44:33] you're born again at
[1:44:36] Faith The Headstone is what's pulling
[1:44:41] you longing to bring it forth so that
[1:44:45] way your soul is you the offy
[1:44:48] now he but said we bypast Earth
[1:44:52] theophany
[1:44:54] come in the world be
[1:44:56] tempted now what's he talking about when
[1:44:58] he said your soul was your
[1:45:01] theophany and who is this meled he said
[1:45:03] you
[1:45:05] bypassed he said you never come like
[1:45:08] Jesus he said you come like
[1:45:11] me lost all see Jesus came if you just
[1:45:16] listen read who is this m chest Jesus
[1:45:20] came in a word body
[1:45:24] right before the world ever begun not
[1:45:28] Jesus the flesh Jesus the
[1:45:32] Christ the son of
[1:45:34] God the logos the
[1:45:37] theop that went out of God which was God
[1:45:41] in another form the prophet
[1:45:43] said and see then when that
[1:45:45] happened he was word body you and I
[1:45:49] bypass a word
[1:45:51] body we still Ste In the Flesh to be
[1:45:54] tempted he said we become the word
[1:46:00] here and he's explaining the the
[1:46:02] difference between a person that's
[1:46:04] resurrected he said their soul is loose
[1:46:07] come the spirit Spirit to the body they
[1:46:09] stand up he said but not so for us here
[1:46:11] he said here we
[1:46:13] take this body to meet the theophany
[1:46:17] what's he
[1:46:20] meaning we take it to the word
[1:46:26] it becomes the word here we don't become
[1:46:28] the word when we get to heaven we better
[1:46:31] become it
[1:46:33] here then we can go to
[1:46:36] heaven so then your soul is your
[1:46:38] theophany
[1:46:40] right because it's who you are and
[1:46:43] whoever's on that Throne is what's
[1:46:46] ruling it when you start in that new
[1:46:49] birth and that's why it takes
[1:46:52] justification same to drive that thing
[1:46:54] out of there future home read it 1516
[1:46:58] future home drives it
[1:47:01] out where that Holy Ghost can come in
[1:47:03] and
[1:47:04] live now you got something
[1:47:06] positive but you ain't complete yet you
[1:47:10] only have the earnest of your
[1:47:12] inheritance that's right you only have
[1:47:15] the earnest of the Holy Ghost I thought
[1:47:18] I you got the person of Jesus Christ but
[1:47:21] it's in a baby form what else can you
[1:47:23] call
[1:47:25] it you're a baby and it's a
[1:47:29] baby as it grows you
[1:47:32] grow until we must become the word
[1:47:36] here so then we're not going to heaven
[1:47:39] to be made
[1:47:41] Eternal it's right here
[1:47:45] right are we ain't going to
[1:47:51] heaven you see what I'm talking
[1:47:54] about if you don't say I don't see what
[1:47:56] you're talking about are you saying that
[1:47:58] when we receive the Holy Ghost I mean
[1:48:01] you said when we're born that the
[1:48:05] devil I mean we that's the nature he
[1:48:08] pervert your nature of your soul but
[1:48:10] when you receive the Holy Ghost then and
[1:48:12] you start upward is it that the nature
[1:48:15] nature of the Holy Ghost draw just comes
[1:48:18] in you and draws you upward your on your
[1:48:21] theophany mhm cuz that's the positive
[1:48:24] okay the throne or whatever it says if
[1:48:27] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:48:28] have one
[1:48:30] waiting but you know what
[1:48:34] somebody is not going to die that's
[1:48:37] right so it's got to come
[1:48:43] here come on Jesus was made Eternal here
[1:48:48] not Eternal up
[1:48:50] there he went through his here so
[1:49:52] uh well we going to make some way for
[1:49:54] them
[1:49:57] too talking about bride we ain't making
[1:50:00] way for
[1:50:01] nobody he made a
[1:50:03] way anybody
[1:50:07] else he maybe I can get away from
[1:50:09] holling and screaming but sister Trudy
[1:50:18] wants with what Freda was talking about
[1:50:21] I I remember brother Brandon when he had
[1:50:23] that vision and uh he saw Sharon Rose
[1:50:27] who died when she was what8 months or
[1:50:30] and yet he didn't recognize her because
[1:50:32] she was a grown woman right so when a
[1:50:35] baby dies or anybody younger than an
[1:50:38] adult of in of adult
[1:50:41] stature they automatically get their
[1:50:44] grown
[1:50:46] body and the Saints under the altar are
[1:50:49] they still in the position of just
[1:50:51] having the uh the
[1:50:54] earnest because they're not changed yet
[1:50:56] they're not in a glorified
[1:50:58] State uh those you talking about the
[1:51:01] true bride that's died going on
[1:51:04] yes that's a one I personally say I
[1:51:08] don't
[1:51:09] understand uh but I do know one thing
[1:51:11] for sure they are Eternal those that He
[1:51:15] Saw beyond the curtain of time were full
[1:51:16] grown people that were there in
[1:51:19] theophany and that was not just an
[1:51:21] earnest to them it was to
[1:51:26] fullness see and in comparing it
[1:51:28] Luther's justification just an Earnest
[1:51:30] to what we have but yet still his
[1:51:33] Earnest was his
[1:51:34] fullness right there was nothing to be
[1:51:38] added to Luther we don't raise him up
[1:51:39] and add something to
[1:51:41] him when brother R saw those beyond the
[1:51:44] curtain of time they were in their
[1:51:47] fullness for what they
[1:51:49] were or the day they were living
[1:51:53] anything else so when a baby dies and it
[1:51:56] gets that adult
[1:51:58] theophany is everybody that's under the
[1:52:00] alar Sharon Rose included right she's
[1:52:02] under the altar isn't she MH
[1:52:06] um are they all on the same level the
[1:52:09] very same
[1:52:11] level in Revelation I guess would be the
[1:52:14] question I
[1:52:16] have now you you got to remember and
[1:52:19] this is not
[1:52:21] making because she was part of brother
[1:52:25] brandham but yet there is a more truth
[1:52:28] to him in talking about her than I
[1:52:31] believe that it's an average person I'm
[1:52:33] I'm honest if you don't like those
[1:52:34] statements that's all right with me uh
[1:52:37] but see Sharon
[1:52:40] Rose when he saw her she was in a
[1:52:43] full-grown woman uh when she died she
[1:52:46] was a
[1:52:47] baby you remember and she was talking to
[1:52:50] him about telling him what would take
[1:52:53] place you know Billy's down here we go
[1:52:54] do this or that the other uh remember
[1:52:57] now that's the child of a prophet that
[1:53:00] I'm not trying to make that that other
[1:53:03] people are secondary but I don't put
[1:53:05] every soul of every baby in the same
[1:53:09] place uh just no more than I put because
[1:53:13] you say you're a Christian in the same
[1:53:14] place there's foolish virgins that died
[1:53:16] and went on you can't put them nowhere
[1:53:19] but in the sixth Dimension all right but
[1:53:22] evidently in that sixth Dimension there
[1:53:24] are sections or something know how you
[1:53:26] want to explain it uh you know this
[1:53:31] group is not with this
[1:53:33] group and see if that's baby is
[1:53:37] there now the baby the baby doesn't have
[1:53:40] eternal
[1:53:42] life the baby that's died just a baby
[1:53:45] that's died doesn't automatically go to
[1:53:47] eternal life it would have to go to a
[1:53:50] position of holding
[1:53:53] but it would not automatic even though
[1:53:54] all babies go to heaven that's what we
[1:53:57] want to think but does it go to heaven
[1:53:59] with eternal
[1:54:00] life or does it go to a positional
[1:54:03] position to
[1:54:05] wait until a time that when others can
[1:54:08] be brought
[1:54:09] forth CU if you ain't careful see then
[1:54:11] you'll just make everybody that dies a
[1:54:13] baby underage they automatically go into
[1:54:15] eternal life no that you're getting a
[1:54:17] little I think that's going a little too
[1:54:19] far I'm
[1:54:20] honest and there's degrees in
[1:54:24] heaven there's going to be rulers in
[1:54:26] heaven there's going to be servants in
[1:54:29] heaven and I think there's going to be
[1:54:31] degrees I think there are degrees of
[1:54:33] where when a baby
[1:54:35] dies that the baby goes and it's
[1:54:39] somewhere and it soul is
[1:54:42] somewhere but it's not
[1:54:45] complete because its body is still down
[1:54:49] here so then don't make it eternal I
[1:54:53] said now there is a situation there
[1:54:54] brother around his child you're getting
[1:54:57] into
[1:54:58] a we call it a gray area but uh it's an
[1:55:03] area of knowing
[1:55:06] that it was his
[1:55:08] child not a
[1:55:11] specialty but I don't see I don't put
[1:55:13] every baby that di say baby die right
[1:55:15] now I don't say that it steps over into
[1:55:17] eternal life but it does go
[1:55:21] somewhere cuz remember all foolish
[1:55:23] virgins that do not have eternal
[1:55:25] life right they're not giving eternal
[1:55:28] life when they die they've got to go to
[1:55:31] the white Throne well now I'm going
[1:55:34] through see the baby that dies under the
[1:55:36] age of accountability don't have to go
[1:55:38] to the white Throne right I don't
[1:55:40] believe that now because I don't believe
[1:55:42] they go to the white throne but I
[1:55:44] believe they're in with they're
[1:55:45] withholding from a position of going
[1:55:48] forth
[1:55:50] until you know something can happen in
[1:55:53] the end of all
[1:55:56] things now brother randam says that
[1:55:58] those fifth seal Jews will give be given
[1:56:01] eternal life under the seventh seal
[1:56:03] that's what he says that's a direct
[1:56:04] quote do they have it
[1:56:07] now no I believe they're in a holding
[1:56:10] Place hard words don't have no education
[1:56:14] they're in a position a
[1:56:16] place and it would have to be in the
[1:56:18] sixth Dimension cuz they can't put them
[1:56:20] in the fifth that's too much Catholicism
[1:56:23] to put them in the fifth and try to draw
[1:56:24] them out to put them up into the sixth
[1:56:27] that's Catholicism remember everybody
[1:56:29] goes to hell they got to come out I
[1:56:32] don't believe that I believe the Fifth
[1:56:34] Dimension the prophet said is the cner
[1:56:40] dead but I don't believe babies have to
[1:56:43] go to a center dead position but they
[1:56:46] can't go to a completed
[1:56:51] position
[1:56:53] I still believe and all of that waiting
[1:56:56] on you and
[1:56:57] I the day without us cannot be made
[1:57:01] perfect we're doing the pulling folks
[1:57:04] it's that what you talking about what I
[1:57:07] still find hard to understand is how and
[1:57:10] I this is very childish and I'm sorry
[1:57:13] but brother brandom God took a picture
[1:57:17] of everybody at a certain age Sharon
[1:57:20] Rose never came to that point on Earth
[1:57:23] yeah and I don't understand how God
[1:57:26] would know what she would be like except
[1:57:29] that he's
[1:57:31] omniscient so he would know what I I
[1:57:34] have no problem with him knowing what
[1:57:35] she look like I don't no problem with
[1:57:37] that because if he could see what I
[1:57:40] would be you know I have no problem with
[1:57:43] him being able to see what she would
[1:57:45] look like because I believe he knows
[1:57:47] what every one of them babies that died
[1:57:49] would look like had to reach that age
[1:57:52] now just because he didn't take the
[1:57:55] picture and really basically if you get
[1:57:58] down to it the picture was made before
[1:58:01] the
[1:58:03] world in God's
[1:58:05] mind the picture of who' be lost a
[1:58:08] picture who' be saved the things brother
[1:58:11] randam is emphasizing if you'll notice
[1:58:14] he doesn't say when you're born again he
[1:58:15] says when you come up to about 18 20
[1:58:18] years of age set a pictures take he's
[1:58:20] emphasizing a natural situ situation a
[1:58:23] natural person standing looking a
[1:58:25] pictures taken he said god holds that
[1:58:28] cuz you're going to return to that so
[1:58:31] he's not really discussing
[1:58:35] salvation that's what I say to me the
[1:58:37] discussion of Salvation would go before
[1:58:39] the foundation of the world God knew in
[1:58:41] his mind what you and I would look like
[1:58:43] how many people would be here whether or
[1:58:46] not we would accept him as our savior he
[1:58:48] know all about
[1:58:49] it and he was able to write down her
[1:58:51] name
[1:58:52] is able to tell who's going to be there
[1:58:55] and that's what the brother said last
[1:58:57] night that anybody that wouldn't bride
[1:58:59] in the future home would be there in a
[1:59:01] mortal body of some form he said I don't
[1:59:04] agree with that uh-uh anybody in that
[1:59:08] future home is going to be
[1:59:12] Eternal right why because the scripture
[1:59:15] says I make all
[1:59:18] things
[1:59:21] new you said well why can't you just
[1:59:23] leave them mortal what do you want to
[1:59:24] leave a mortal for what's your
[1:59:27] problem what do you want them to be
[1:59:29] mortal where you can look down at them
[1:59:31] you mortal I'm
[1:59:33] Immortal
[1:59:36] no go ahead we
[1:59:38] got anybody
[1:59:46] else I just
[1:59:50] to okay thank you thank you that's good
[1:59:54] like the old saying goes about you
[1:59:58] know you don't ask you questions
[2:00:02] now forever hold your
[2:00:05] peace cuz you have an opportunity that's
[2:00:08] the one thing I think I'm honest and I
[2:00:11] think you'll agree I don't think that
[2:00:13] most ministers open up to allow you to
[2:00:16] question them about what to
[2:00:19] say right
[2:00:22] but you're welcome to it anytime with me
[2:00:25] why because number
[2:00:27] one if you don't understand what I'm
[2:00:30] talking

[2:00:34] prophet I can't discern you out I may
[2:00:37] pick out as I said this morning I may
