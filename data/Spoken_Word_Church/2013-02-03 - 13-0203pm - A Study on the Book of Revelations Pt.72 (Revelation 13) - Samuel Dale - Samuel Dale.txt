this afternoon Lord and we pray that you would just touch their bodies and make them whole for you we love you and we thank you and just have your way lead us by thy Grace and father just teach us to wait upon you amen guide us now in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 1 and then we'll go to Revelations 13 trying to move on a little bit is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel and his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are WR written therein for the time is at hand am now let's go to Revelations 13 and we'll read the first eight verses I'm sure we won't get that far but we'll read this and I and I stood up on the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads what upon his heads right the name of blasphemia yep and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and deceit and great Authority and I saw one of the heads as it were wounded under death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him there was given unto him a great a mouth speaking great things blasphemies power was given unto him to continue for in two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given un given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word I was start thinking and maybe some of you especially on the internet system wouldn't know what I'm going to say but the brother you heard saying just a moment ago back years ago he was fishing with his brother and he fell out of a boat and he don't know and they don't know how long he was underwater he said the last thing he remembered doing was just thinking cuz he had on boots and they just sucked up the water so he couldn't come back up and he just stuck the rod up and held it his brother had to get back to the boat get in the boat get back to where they were and he just reached down in the water with his hands and picked up and caught the end of the rod pulled him up out of it now I'll bet you that there's a lot of Rod and re Country Companies would love to put their name on that because how many that's right how many how many rods are they in the world that's right and this is not deep sea fishing no how many rods would pull up a little bit over 200 lb and bring him up out of the water that's right amen you know there's miracles of god am we amen amen left and in a hurry getting down there cuz it was down in what was it way down the road there for gri gri going down that way and thinking Lord what in the world old see could no mad can survive under the water right he just ain't made that way no that's right but we got there and he just sitting under the bed Laing and talking just like nothing happen thank God Amen he's a miracle working amen all right now not just mention much about it but to back up a little bit and just say what we were talking about this morning that you know there's a compound meaning and even the prophet said a compound Revelation now not a different not a different Revelation and you say well that's the way I see it and that's the way you see it okay if if it's correct then all right but but it's not saying I see three gods in the Bible now what do you see well I see one God now see you're just arguing quotes right you know because you know the truth is the truth and a compound understanding like calling Jacob or Israel out of Egypt and calling Jesus out of Egypt right are like the things we covered about the remnant of the woman's seed which would be the 144,000 the remnant of Israel and then the the foolish virgins is the remnant of the Bride right all right and seeing those things and just looking at these scriptures as we go through to try to help and you could literally spend months on any of these uh scriptures but I'm just trying to just get a little idea as to we look at it and see what these things mean and their symbols all right and it took a prophet to come and give us the understanding of these symbols thank God for that we could have man's ideas and opinions and you can read them the commentaries and different things and one will say it's this and the other will say it's that and you know but thank God for the revealing of his word all right but not a different meaning now but even as to be the Israel of the old and the Jesus you know the brighter than you right that's compound meaning but it all ties together amen and it has in related connections it cannot be separated so thereby you can understand the Book of Revelations and see what I've said for 30 years or 40 nearly that the sealed is not to the bride no right they're to Israel amen the literal things but the Revelation is to the bride we don't have to go through the tri ration period to find out what's going to happen we just read the prophet and he tells us what these things are going to be well that's what I love to read is the scripture and that's why I said for many years see I I've studied and you anybody can see my Bible I just write right to the side of it there am what the prophet said this is right all right and that way then I I don't have to say well what's your input right that's really smart I'm just old country boy I never didn't know what input mean I'd have to go home look at do you know you say well it just means whatever you think well I didn't think we're supposed to think I thought we were supposed to believe the word all right but now listen looking at the symbols and seeing the symbols of the Bible and then it makes it simple and we're not looking for a King Kong Beast to run across not looking for a big leopard to be running or a line to be roaring and all right see looking at simple things well one of these days the Bible says the moon will turn to blood well it just well it's just going to turn the blood the prophet said I can show you where that's already happened I can't cuz I ain't never found where he told me to happened right but I believe what he said don't you right all right been looking for these great things to transpire we can be deceived that's right you know but if we are programmed by it to understand it's simple then amen it's not something that cannot be comprehended you could spend I said weeks and weeks going back to the Book of Daniel and just take this first verse that we read of the 13th or the first and the second and get a beast and a lion and a I mean a leopard and and feed of this and that and go back into the Book of Daniel go back there and read the book of Daniel y and you'll find some of those things where the mees of Persians and Roman governments as they were coming down in the stages as they were coming and yet we're looking for this to happen what it's already happened amen see but thank God for the truth amen right now we read here in Revelations 13 we be dealing with just a little bit probably verse one's about all we'll get because of what I want to say in a second but we see in Revelations 131 that it speaks now here's what I'm trying to say about the compound see watch it go back watch's this be one continual Vision as the Book of Daniel a dream or a vision whatever he have he'd have one and he have another one that next one just adds a little bit too and then the next one just adds a little bit too the next one just adds a little bit to and that's the way God does things amen you know to put it together to where that we can follow it the Book of Revelations to me see as I said we start Revelations uh 7 you're already picked up the tribulation period you're only dealing with a 3 and 1/2 year period but you got 7even 8 N9 10 11 12 13 they were already up and we're only dealing with 3 and 1/2 years of time but yet these things that we're seeing are transpiring during that period of time so it's not looking for some kind of a great animal thing look at the symbols to see what it means right amen we were talking this morning there about the remnant and says it sent out the the floods well that looks like the whole world is going to be flooded with water there this great floods of water no it Waters is multitudes and people right amen right amen and you can see that your next door neighbor right is the one you're talking about right right right we're still protected by our government and thank God for that you we were trying to cover there a little bit about it this morning about the Jews coming to this country see the Bible says they come over the wall they come to Propet said they come to America why because that was the The Haven of Rest right because even the rest of the world was killing them and all of the different things but then we wound up talking about right at the end about how that you know they were were protecting of them in America Sister Barbara was bringing it to my attention she didn't explain it a whole lot better than I can that you know that the first person that stepped their foot off of Columbus his boat into American soil was a Jew and she says that's let her give you the page number the paragraph all right see is it something that they were sent here for protection right to take care of them all of those Millions being killed but you know what the shame of America is that they're allowed Millions to be killed right and remember remember that there was a rabbi went to one of our ambassadors and begged him to help them during this problem and he laughed and made fun of him and turned away and that Rabbi cursed that Family Y and that family has had cursed on them ever since that's right well I couldn't have because he wouldn't have God yes he was of God see that's where we want to tie everything to our little thoughts and ideas but you see they came to America for freedom and we came here for Religious Freedom right and now we're voting away yep our freedom that's why I told you last time I voted years before I came into message in ' 66 heard about it I voted for John F Kennedy brother R said look said you come over here for religion just Freedom you know freedom from from religion and said you voted into the White House you know I haven't voted since then for President right cuz I just don't you vote that's they doing I just said that's me see because look what a goof up and he said then said watch till they wormed their way into the Senate and the house and the C I got it written somewhere in the front of my Bible and this was about 1967 68 that I had I ran up as much as I could find of how many many representatives how many these how many congress how much Senate was already Catholic yeah and it was a big major big not a majority but a great big amount of people were already in those offices right Church we're we're in the end time whether we want to believe it or not you know not to try to scare somebody I like what was said the other day somebody was talking about it where you know that said man said well brother brandom said you scare of them people talking about the coming of Jesus Christ yeah I like what brother R said he said yeah you don't want to see us coming yeah right you don't want to see us coming right don't worry about it you ain't going to scare nobody right amen we've done spooked too much but now listen Revelations 13:1 talks about this Beast that will rise up out of the sea having seven heads and and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy well we you know we covered that on verse one of chapter 12 because it's almost identical carrying a woman clothed in the Sun and under her feet upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child and then it comes down to the verse three and it comes down to verse three and appeared another great Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven horns and 10 seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head y whoever who this is in Chapter 13 with this Beast is the same being person whatever you call it as chapter 12 covers of verse three right so we don't have to worry about who this is all right who is that great red dragon WR amen who is this Beast here Rome we don't have time to get to it I know but I've got the notes in here for it but what about the image to the Beast right we'll get back to that if we have time but we don't I'm sure we won't but just think about it we don't have to in other words he's telling you here just like I said about the Book of Daniel it shows you this and then it shows you the Roman government as it preceded from mea Persians to to this to Alexander to to coming down and see here we look in the 12th chapter and we find this dragon with seven heads and 10 horns you know and seven heads up crowns up on his head now we see the Great Dragon now the next chapter we see it as a beast right so if we see this is Rome over here then why are we hunting the Beast over here you know what I'm saying it would be the same situation right coming down as to to give us understanding and that has always been Rome we covered our you know Wednesday night I guess it was paragraph 53 of the 10 virgins this for one to where you can go with it that it would be Rome and then you remember natural Rome was the first to try to kill Jesus right Caesar or hared you know right yep gave a commandment for all the babies to be killed yep amen trying to destroy Jesus Christ see then that same thing the prophet said he said that me same comes over into the Rome that there stood the Jews you say Well they're over here and Rome they're over there but when those Jews said let his blood be on us crucify him we have only one God and his name is Caesar they had the same Roman spirit that was killing the babies am right in the natural you understand see it's very simple to look at it right and to see what it's doing and see that Rome then it comes on down we'll get back to these because we don't have time today but we'll get over to where that the the womb was healed and and the Beast was and come back one of his heads and things and to see those things and look at it as looking in our day amen that's it then an our day in our time MH because even though this would be the tribulation period that we'd be reading about but this dragon that we read about in chapter 12 it it's taken that 2,000 years to come into being into the way that that Satan wants it to be and then when we get over here we find in chapter 12 as we covering this morning if you'll watch the way I try to lay things out after the bride is taken up after this 144,000 is called out mhm after he's loosed onto these you know see now he's the Beast right cuz he can't be the Beast until we get out of here that's right he is not the Beast until we leave right why because he can't be here at the same time we are right man and God God would not allow that to take place Satan doesn't know how to be the Beast until the bride becomes the fullness of the godhead bodily incarnate in a people prise God because what is the beast beast is Satan incarnate in a man that's right amen he can't be that until we get out of here you break scripture right so he's not the Beast he is now the incarn false prophet our Pope right he's not in the form of the Beast right he won't do that until he sits in the temple of God showing himself to be as God Amen and that's after the Rapture cuz he doesn't know how to do it we read it this morning where brother R said as we go up for seal he said he comes down becomes incarnate in the Beast after we're gone that the Beast can come into be so it's just showing you this and then adding a a little bit more and then we go to the next chapter and just adds a little bit more to the story you know sometimes just read that away and say you know I found that how about do and you'll find out that some of these things are repeated a good many times right I believe I think mistaken this head in different things is about four times the Book of Revelation if F mistaken I got it written somewhere but it talks about the head and the crowns and the mountains and the thing see it's just keeps unfolding right amen here's a beast all right but then that Beast is sitting where on Seven Hills right y see then this keeps unfolding and that setting on Seven Hill we read me is what yep Rome sits on Seven Hills that's right you say Cincinnati well how old it's on Seven Hills Frome it is but it's just like figuring out your name Richard whatever Marlo might figure out to be 666 right you're name may be and mean in Roman numerals numbers 666 but you're not trying to rule the world and like the prophet says Cincinnati is not a church right and there's no way Cincinnati is trying to rule the world right no so then all right we just let the prophet break it down to simple terminologies and then we we look at it in the correct way you know uh I forgot I was looking the other day CU I got it down on the 666 but some head of some great uh religious movement I'll bring it when I think it their name figured out to be 666 when the people was trying to figure it out but that's still mine may be that but you might run back William Mari and brandom and find it to be 666 I don't think it is because of the Roman numerals you know but he's not trying to rule the world so we're finding out these things but seeing that it's not somewhere else amen that's right seeing it unfold is being right here Among Us amen the things that we as organized religion people looked at until the prophet came is now already he said even been fulfilled are being fulfilled well you know that should give you Joy amen amen you know if I wasn't even a born again Christian and you would hand me the Bible with this understanding that I could follow and see these things unveil I want to read it cuz it give me a great understanding of History especially if I take the Book of Revelation and see the the Greeks the me of Persians and things coming down and coming on down to the 10 toes of Daniel y five Western countries five Eastern countries and I stood Eisen high and Cru chef and Eisen is iron and Cru Chef is clay and there they stood right there right at a un meeting and met and we're looking for the T Toes or some something you yeah see church I think it's time to wake up amen right and realize the message of the hour as the answer what you have need of that's right if you just read it amen that's right you know it'll tell you how to handle all kind of Life Y and doings and things and I I get PL tickled sometimes at the things brother around and says that sounds childish you know but you think about it you know it's the best way to say it y it's good all right amen come on let's get on over in the other because I I know we're not going to get to where the the heads and the doing cuz that's Pagan Rome becoming Pap R all right we we'll get through those things but let's just think about it for a minute this sitting on Seven Hills maybe somebody out D doesn't know these things and maybe they're waiting to hear about it let's see let's see if we have something go ahead put number two brother Joe and let's see if we can talk about this Seven Hills and and these things for a little bit cuz you remember the Bible says he that ha wisdom see here is the one that has wisdom you know that goes over to where to count the number of the man but yet if he has wisdom he can understand these things and what the seven heads seven mountains on which the woman sit how many Hills how many cities in the world that that a church sits on Seven Hills only one where's that the Vatican City in Rome that right the Bible said that this horrible that made all of the world commit forn ations and brought out a bunch of little daughters to teach about the same thing she did that wasn't as bad as her but they were harlots taught them the same thing said the beginning of the will be a w beginning of it will be a woman or a church sitting on seven heels in Rome I've looked all over the world tell me where it's at a church sitting on seven heels and I'm reading this to the Bible now where is it anywhere right now we're not against Rome right right amen I have no problems with it may be L way say I'd rather have them here than have beer joints on every corner right I'd rather have the Catholic I'd rather have a denominational Church sitting right over here than have a be CH setting down especially on Saturday nights when we were having meetings and line I he have it that's not throwing off on them right you know if it wasn't for them would the devil have done got you and I come on you better consider that way right I've always told you if it wasn't for the the National Rifle Association fighting for the rights of the people for guns we' have done lost our guns a long time ago right well let them fight it out right we got no problems right we just go on through life trying to get into the word to receive from God am yes and see what he wants for you and I that's right do we need to understand these things what do you understand or are you looking for some great big something somewhere when you can look as simple as the prophet can read it we'll get back to those in a bit when he said he got no daughters teach about the same thing she did that wasn't as bad as her yeah now who are that they were harage right Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all come out of the Catholic church amen right and see we'll get to it later if that's the Beast then we're the image to the Beast oh no not me there's only one group of people in this world that is not the image to the Beast and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ amen am y do you realize then putting it with it without any backing up or any remorse or what forever to say that the biggest portion of people of this message are are worse than the Catholic Church CU at least the Catholic Church don't teach it's all right to have four or five Liv right that's right so I don't throw off out there I'm preaching here amen I'm talking to you and I now on the internet they're listening that's okay but I'm not Pastor for that I'm just trying to help us all to see the truth right man let see where we're at look at the next one why are we not a denomination 58 927 paragraph 60 and here it is here is and here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sth now that's on over in the scripture one day we'll get over that far okay watch now there is only one city that I know of in the world there's two cities that I know of that has seven or more Mountains in it Cincinnati is one of them now I don't understand this what it means but he evidently did he said which is supposed to be the fiction story of Cincinnati it's the mother wol now I don't know what that mean I didn't look that up you know that so but but it's has more than that in it but there's no one Church denominates Cincinnati there's only one place in the world that has a church sitting on seven heels that dominates the entire world right right you know that in World War II you were allowed to fire on all of the other parts of the country but could not fire shot toward the Vatican go back and listen to you older brothers they wouldn't allow them they already had control right they got control of the world y right you say well they'll get us okay but they can't get us till God gets through amen that's right and when God gets through with us we're going under that's right so I'm not scared right amen I I don't go out on the street corners with the thing on my back Catholic Church is the Beast and the denominations is a mark of the beast I don't think there's no need of that no cuz ain't nobody going to look at it they just going to make fun of you it's not going to help anything we're already open to the internet I mean what we're saying is worldwide they can use it anytime they wish that's right amen and hear anytime they wish right but I have nothing against the Catholic I have nothing against the Protestants right you know I have great friends that are denominational people right we do anything in the world for me I'm not against that I'm against the denomination that's in this message that's destroying the people of this smash that's the denomination I'm against right but just think about it look at these crayons go to number four and look at these crayons that we read of because remember what did it have had seven heads 10 horns and upon the horns 10 crowns all right the crowns what do they represent the mark of the beast 1954 513 and the 10 horns which thou sawest are 10 Kings which have received no kingdoms as yet that's up in the scripture you but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast watch it and who would ever thought about this being oh if we just had received no powers yet in case you just see people this is King so and so and that's King so and so and all at once you run out of Kings y right you don't have enough 10 to go around CU really is the king of England still alive and I know the queen queen see but the king's not alive you don't have a king in the world of any country you said well someone throw over and someone throws a king H what are they receive no power yet they're not Kings they didn't have the they T the horns didn't have crowns they receive power like kings what is it dictators not Crown Kings dictators what's every country controlled by now right dictators y you don't have any place where they vote kings are you can have little people that believe oh I'm the king of this I'm the king of that Napoleon too you know with his hand but they're dictators look around the world now going to the next one number five the nextage why we are honor denominations this is paragraph 71 they're not Crown Kings they're dictators see they never were Crown Kings but they Reed power as kings one hour in the reain of the beast that's just in this little sh we time right now where dictators are rising up see receive power as kings one hour with the Beast now if they receive power with the King that means in the tribulation so we're not there yet so he says look what they're doing now see they're rising up little dictatorships rising up right all these little countries have dictators over them yep you know it would take here that could be a coupe any time you wanted to take and and somebody could kill the president and the vice president and take over this country and it would be a dictatorship I mean you have a coupe over in the country and the guy pushes another fell out right you know what I mean we just have them voted we just vote to push him out yeah right what's the difference when Kennedy was killed I wonder what the newspapers overseas wrote Coupe in process in America they killed the president you see Church come on yeah just get him a point look at the next one CU this is one I like which is paragraph 88 of the why are we not and what's that now these 10 horns these 10 kingdoms see that's where everything falling in now I dropped off a point back up in my mind if this is in the tribulation period Then a lot of these dictators have not risen the power yet right you know that we as I was telling them last night in the Bible study we are trying to buy the Friendship of the world right to keep communism from taking over a country we go in and we literally Wipe Out the ruler oh no we don't do that we're Christian garbage can amen we kill more people than anybody you want a little statement if we're the image to the Beast and nobody can fight against us who do you think is ruling the world right now I'll get back to that you know that there's not a country in the world capable of rising up against us if they would turn us loose right right not a country in the world could survive cuz we've got the bombs we got the equipment that's why we're the image to the Beast Y and you and I are a part of that that's right okay listen look what he says that's everything falling in what these dictators are what's the way dictators lean to where is it leaning to are they going to lean towards the United States we're buying them right we're buying countries we're putting in people in countries to rule those countries right and giving them all kind of money billions of dollars going but if remember in the tribulation the United States is blown to peace so they won't be coming to us for money right if you fall want my point this is in the tribulation and the tribulation is not going to be the Great American economy ruling the world the American economy is going to be gone that's right so they're going to go to Communism right you said well we know communism can't rule the world that's right but it'll get ready to blow Rome off the map that is true brother R said communism will never rule the world but he said Russia put a bomb right in the Vatican one of these days so just think what's the way dictator gan where is it leaning to it's like tell me a dictator that doesn't lean to work communism and see they shall what hate the the woman the church but watch what going to do it I love thee they shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire that's what's going to happen right to Rome and America because we are are the image to the Beast sensible right right right they' got head on their head's a name of blaspheming they don't need to run this up but what is blaspheming the brother around said is this to make fun of ridicule talk about you think the world don't ridicule in life about America sure and you know the biggest point of their laughing is the American people and the way we live and the way we do and call ourselves Christians right the way we dress and our actions and reactions yep name a Bless but where's it at to just get to point cuz we'll get the whole we'll go back and furthermore cover but you know Revelations 13 is a very odd thing and that's the United States of America is Revelations 13 and yet you and I are a part of it H you high up L people getting sleepy on me today so wake up ain't coming down with a pencil and F you Revelations 13 is America listen to your definition go ahead brother pull up number eight listen to the definition your Prophet gives the Hebrew series chapter 4 5 7901 paragraph 102 10 I mean 103 104 did you notice this United States is number 13 and everything it does you know it was established the 13th colony colonies you know the flag had 13 stars in it first you know everything that the United States does in a is a number does in a number 13 Did You Know It appears in the Bible in re aans the 13 certainly does the Little Beast the lamb that come up out of the water not thickness in multitudes of people not out of the water but out of a land where there's no one see one of them comes up out of the land so it's certainly not a water beast and it's people it had two little horns this animal in the Book of Revelation has two little horn civil and ecclesiastical Powers that's right right and he was a lamb freedom of religion is that where we came here and after a while they w't after a while they went together and he spoke like a dragon and exercise all the power that Rome did before him in other words all the power of Rome will be invested into that little lamb that's in America we're the only one that can control the world folks God has designed it that way what about a people and we're policing probably a half of it with our troops right that's coming to our nation you mark it down you watch to the Confederate of churches and the Catholic unite together Confederation of church and Catholic unite watch what takes place people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time but they're ready for the translation at that time I love that that's right so we're going to be ready that's just right just ready to go for the lamb overcame them said the Bible and them that followed him because they were called The Chosen the faithful and all getting unto the prophecy it's not all down and out right right it's going to be a great thing when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord is going to raise up a standard against that right they're not going to kill us they may kill some but they're not going to kill the entirety the bright right she's going to stand on the word amen God's going to take her up y but some of us may give our lives for what we believe so what right so what right yeah well I don't want to die neither do I but so what right right am wouldn't you want to die for Jesus Christ amen right would you be willing to die for what you believe amen or would you fold up and quit you know look at the next one number nine paragraph 135 when we are not Den let me tell you right now not just SK skinning women I'm wanting man to understand you're in on this too that's right let me tell you something brother this nation is a woman's Nation I'll prove that that by you by the scripture by anything that you want to prove it by this is what appears on your money a woman where she found in Revelation here you see her she's number 13 everything she started 13 stars 13 stripes 13 callings 13 everything was 13 to begin with she appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation as a woman 13 right you say where is it on your money look the next one number 10 paragraph 136 the L we excuse me I'm down I better turn pages and get CAU everything okay e92 from that time 19676 and so this I I won't have time this meeting to tell you in 33 he's explaining back above our the visions and things okay and comes up to 33 this is a woman's Nation it's the number 13 it appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything's a 13 everything is a woman and remember thus sayith the Lord there will be a woman rued before the end time okay you'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her a great woman and Nation bowed to her the nation bowed to her it'll be one be one before the end time thus sayith the Lord write it down and find out you young people and seen it happen if it isn't I'm a false prophet amen young people young people cuz old ones going to be gone amen that's right you young people it may be a while till this takes place cuz we've never set dates and times and Seasons amen but somebody's going to see amen what you'll either be president or vice president all right we got very close back in a last race or the one before there somewhere in there that we we had a woman hitting the ticket right right Hillary's pulled off what she going to do a know my buiness I don't really care CU my Bible said I put in Kings and I take out Kings and like I've always told you if I had the pen that would put us to the PACE to where it would force us into a a thing to where that we'd be brought to our knees as a bride to be humbled into God and I could sign it I'd sign it and put it in the Catholic church or whoever that's right why because there things need to be over with they don't need to be played around amen that's right yeah but brother Dale you're old and we're young hey I was preaching this when I was younger than most of you right right but look what he says he says thus sayith the Lord two times that's right amen okay look the next the Ladi in in church page paragraph 49 which has 12 196 121 e but there will be a powerful woman now remember this is on tape too a powerful woman great woman she'll either be president or to be a woman representing the Catholic Church which I think it is will take over here someday and she'll rule this country this nation this nation is a woman's Nation flag was made by a woman mhm it's number 13 she started out 13 13 strip 13 callings everything's 13 13 right on down 13

the offices she she took over everything there is equal rights with a man votes with a man curses like a man drink like a man everything else and just bit for the Catholic church for the worship of a woman that's right and they're already Worship in a woman anyhow right next whatever the next one what it broken sister m h paragraph 49 broken sister now we find again that this Mark of the Beast that was formed here America is number 13 it was born with 13 colon he had a flag that had 13 stars 13 stri and even the appears in Revelation 13th chapter America has always been a woman represented on our coins many ever thought of this one yeah even the ending head on a penny is a woman's profile valuable right now we know that know the history of it everything the Liberty Bell and everything else the Liberty Statute of Liberty is what yep woman a woman everything a woman a woman number 13 that's beautiful to see those things number 13 everything's number 13 let's see where I need cut off okay let's read a couple more then I'll quit number 13 okay number 13 which is Page 131 you already beat me to it number 13 number 13 all right the number 13 1 13 13 sure lot so in church AG with church now if you think this shocking just wait until the prophecy of Revelation 13 is fulfilled it is strikingly true that the United States of America is in that chapter the number very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it stared with 13 colonies the flag has 13 stars and 13 stripes and there is her Destiny in the 13th chapter in this image that is mentioned in this chapter will be found all the wickedness of the Beast that was before it as the Beast rose out of n of the Nan Council so the image will come out of the World Council of churches with all ungodly and Satan s satanic power to vent the anger of the devil upon the True Vine of God it'll be a very Repeat Performance of all diabolical coming and cruelty amen what about it that's right let's take this license we'll quit on the other do cover the image of the Beast maybe winsty Rapture paragraph 61 look at just how it's blacked out the pope just come over here remember the tab member of the Tabernacle when them you got takes I guess all you take them as that the Lord showed there that day in the Tabernacle exactly where those Church ages would be and how they would be I had them draw out on the board up there in church Ages which you see here draw out in a book and if that hold it Spirit didn't come down in a pillar of fire and went right back there on the wall and draw them out himself while 3 or 400 people sitting looking and just as the Poke started over here the moon somehow blacked out now what was draw out didn't become into reality right the moon blacked out and they took their pictures the same way that it was draw up there on the platform and has made his trip over here on the 13th walked 13 steps serve communion to 13 to a nation that's number 13 and blackouts coming everywhere don't you see where we're at we're at the end time amen why would that Pope choose to serve communion to 13 people right y why would the people make 13 steps Y and hey folks when he lands in the country he gets down and kisses the ground not because he's so humble everywhere he goes he's claiming that territory that's right for his own we get into the image of the Beast and see more where we're at but just think about it man we're right in the middle of the biggest thing m of taking place all forms and parts and looking for it wondering yeah you and I've for a year now I've noticed one thing that seemingly there even for a couple of years more seemingly there's not a lot of persecutions and things going on there's kind of a love a kind of a backing off maybe look like I don't know cuz I watch those things and I you know I'm not a doom day preacher but I watch and see it looks like that everything is kind of have you noticed it thing people just don't argue with you no more you know to get a good F you'd have to go down and start one you know what I me spiritually there people just don't come and looking for you they don't coming badly I thought when we opened up on the internet that I done told these brothers I said be ready that computer's going to be burning hot cuz when I say this is what the prophet said they're going to we're going to be getting quotes from all over the world surprise me I can get up here and say about anything I want to and ain't nobody calling me and telling me I'm wrong you say well you want to no I don't want to I was just expecting it right you know but you see there's always a love just before the stor that's right y just before things starts ripping rough is always a love you get in a hurricane and when the eye crosses you don't run out yeah and say it's over with it'll be so quiet and peaceful till you think it's all finished but the worst part is coming amen the rest of the storm right I'm not I'm not a doomsday preacher somebody's preaching this that other I want to get out of hereen I want to go out of here I I want a Rapture to take place to carry me out of here to get me out of this world and life but also realize that while I'm here that there things that are to take place right amen and us being in America is a wonderful thing because this is where the Prophet brought his message amen what if this message I'm not throwing off on these countries I'm I'm just talking okay what if the brother Rand have been born in a third world country reform the message could have never been put out no that's right think so God could have took care of it I know he did he brought him to America that's what he took care of okay he put him in America where the money would be Y and like I said we're the smallest country we were talking yesterday and they said how many we got about 380 million 380 million China got a billion China's got over a billion India's got over a billion put Africa all back in the HK together how many billions would they have 7 billion people in the world and we just a little handful but yet we right at this moment are controlling the world right who's the first one that goes when a country Rises up I thought the UN was everybody to go at one time we go we bomb we do cuz nobody can make war against this beast and it's the image to the Beast we control the world we get his fight going down y okay that's right praise the lord we see the truth amen the only thing I'm trying to get you and I to see is don't look at the Bible essay and we can't understand the Book of Revelation it's in these symbols and things well we had a prophet to break the symbol now we can read the book amen and enjoy reading it right and find ourselves now to find myself as the bad is not too good but to find myself on the good side right you know God don't need but one person that's all he needs he went down to Egypt and whipped Egypt with one man and a stick that's right that's right that you don't need a world full of people you just need somebody to believe him I want to do that don't you let's stand together we go into the communion got everything ready
