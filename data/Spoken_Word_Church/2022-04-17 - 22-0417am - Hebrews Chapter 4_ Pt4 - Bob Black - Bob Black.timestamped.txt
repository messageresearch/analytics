[0:02] god bless you thanks
[0:04] good to be in the house of the lord
[0:19] let's just pray before we get into our
[0:20] study lord god we're so grateful to be
[0:22] able to gather into your
[0:23] around your word this morning and gather
[0:26] together with other believers of light
[0:28] precious faith and we just ask lord that
[0:29] you'll just bless the services today
[0:31] lord god and be with us as we study
[0:33] these scriptures out we ask this in your
[0:35] name amen
[0:38] so if you've got your bible we've been
[0:39] studying and uh going through hebrews
[0:41] chapter four
[0:43] and we're uh
[0:44] we've been been talking about rest and
[0:46] uh hebrews chapter four verse one says
[0:49] let us therefore fear
[0:51] lest a promise being left left us
[0:54] of entering into his rest
[0:56] any abuse seem to come short of it
[1:00] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:02] well as unto them but the word preached
[1:03] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:05] faith in them that heard it
[1:07] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:09] rest as he said as i have sworn in my
[1:11] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[1:14] although the works were finished from
[1:15] the foundation of the world
[1:17] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:18] seventh day on this wise and god did
[1:20] rest the seventh day from all his works
[1:24] and in this place again if they shall
[1:25] enter into my rest
[1:27] so we're laboring in it to enter into
[1:29] enter into christ's rest and you know
[1:31] rest is a good picture to maybe to set
[1:34] in your mind is to think about rest is
[1:36] christ
[1:36] jesus is laying in that in that boat
[1:39] asleep and
[1:41] this is kind of a you can't quite see it
[1:42] but they're trying to they're trying to
[1:43] wake jesus up in this boat
[1:45] and all the storms of life all around
[1:48] him are raging and and yet he's asleep
[1:50] because he's calm and you know he knows
[1:53] he knows he's uh
[1:54] rest really is is a revelation a
[1:57] personal revelation of jesus christ a
[1:59] personal revelation of what your purpose
[2:00] is and you know think about jesus laying
[2:02] there in that boat
[2:04] knowing that that how he's what he's got
[2:06] to do what his purpose is that he's got
[2:08] to die on the cross and and he's got you
[2:11] know got some more preaching to do so
[2:12] he's at rest
[2:14] think about david at rest going up
[2:16] against goliath knowing that he had been
[2:18] anointed by samuel
[2:19] um but this arrest that we're talking
[2:21] about is is the rest that comes by the
[2:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:25] and and to to think about you know we
[2:27] want to just kind of meditate on what is
[2:28] what are the effects of the baptism of
[2:30] the holy ghost in your life and
[2:32] one of the effects of course is to to
[2:34] cease from your own works and and and
[2:37] that god will reveal himself to you and
[2:39] that rest is that you're not resting on
[2:41] the things that you do or the things
[2:43] that that you you think about in your
[2:45] intellectual mind but you're resting on
[2:47] a revelation of the revealed of the
[2:50] promises of god
[2:52] so jesus jesus gave us a promise of rest
[2:55] when he said in matthew chapter 11 come
[2:57] unto me all you that labor under heavy
[2:59] laden and i will give you rest and the
[3:02] last few uh little lessons we were just
[3:04] kind of uh just kind of looking
[3:05] examining that pattern of labor before
[3:08] you get to rest
[3:10] and you know in the pattern that we look
[3:11] at
[3:13] sanctification you can look at
[3:14] sanctification as is like you're
[3:16] laboring you're going through that
[3:17] process and like like an ox with a
[3:20] burden you're you're pulling the heavy
[3:21] load and you're trying you're packing
[3:23] that word in and going to church and
[3:25] doing the things that uh you know it
[3:26] looks like a christian would do but you
[3:28] haven't yet entered into rest because
[3:30] you're laboring to a place where
[3:32] god god opens up the word to you and
[3:34] you're resting on what he said
[3:37] and and compare that with the stages of
[3:39] ruth where you know brother brown said
[3:41] in revelation chapter five in that
[3:43] message he said
[3:44] what ruth under justification and ruth
[3:47] under sanctification laboring a legalist
[3:50] and then she finally ended up resting
[3:52] where she she laid down at the feet of
[3:54] boaz and boaz threw that threw his skirt
[3:56] over a type of the baptism the holy
[3:58] ghost and all she had to do from that
[4:00] point on was she said and she she knew
[4:02] that when boaz got up he was gonna he
[4:04] was gonna go to work
[4:06] all she had to do was just rest and
[4:08] trust in him
[4:12] so you know we we follow that type of
[4:14] the of justification sanctification of
[4:17] the baptism the holy ghost where the the
[4:19] lutherans believed it by faith and come
[4:21] into the land and the methodists taught
[4:23] sanctification which was the legalistic
[4:24] standpoint of it so you got to do
[4:26] something
[4:28] i got to quit i got to let my hair grow
[4:30] out said the women
[4:32] of course they wouldn't they don't do it
[4:33] no more but they did do it something
[4:36] legalism sanctification something
[4:38] something that you're doing you're
[4:39] working through
[4:40] they had to work quit wearing the paints
[4:42] in their faces they didn't wear their
[4:43] skirts wrong or short like the others
[4:45] did they had to do something see
[4:48] that's what she did the state of
[4:49] justification the state of
[4:50] sanctification and again down at the
[4:52] bottom right you can see the little the
[4:54] little picture of that ox because you
[4:56] know when you think of sanctification
[4:57] you think of that labor of the ox the ox
[5:00] spirit it's the the the spirit of christ
[5:04] working to do something in your life
[5:07] to bring you to a place and of course we
[5:10] examined last time legalism is when we
[5:12] base our justification on our own law
[5:14] keeping so so again comparing comparing
[5:17] working versus rest
[5:19] you you when you're in that sanctified
[5:21] state
[5:22] you start looking at the things that you
[5:23] do and you say well maybe i'm maybe i'm
[5:25] good maybe this is good enough
[5:27] but you legalism is when we base our
[5:29] justification on our own law keeping
[5:31] rather than on the finish work of christ
[5:33] what he did
[5:35] legalism exists when people attempt to
[5:36] secure righteousness in god's sight by
[5:39] good works looking at what you're doing
[5:41] looking at the thing you know i'm paying
[5:43] my tithes i'm coming to church i'm you
[5:45] know i believe i believe the bible that
[5:47] is true and
[5:48] and you say well that's good enough but
[5:50] yet you haven't entered
[5:51] interest yet
[5:53] legalists believe that they can earn or
[5:55] merit god's approval by performing the
[5:57] requirements of the law
[6:00] that's why in philippians chapter two
[6:02] you know where you're
[6:04] well there's labor before rest and
[6:05] philippians chapter 2 says wherefore my
[6:07] beloved as ye have always obeyed not as
[6:09] in my presence only but now much more in
[6:11] my absence
[6:12] work out your own salvation with fear
[6:15] and trembling for it is god which
[6:17] worketh in you both to will and to do of
[6:20] his good pleasure in that in that a kind
[6:21] of almost a paradox that you got
[6:24] something to do but it's christ doing
[6:26] doing it the work in you
[6:28] christ and you together
[6:30] in second peter chapter one that that
[6:32] talks about that going up the statue of
[6:34] a perfect man give diligence to make
[6:37] your calling in election sure in other
[6:38] words there's something that you got to
[6:40] do you got to open up your bible and
[6:41] spend time with god and make set aside
[6:44] time for him
[6:45] you know there's things that happen
[6:47] automatically but there's part things
[6:48] that you have to do as well for if you
[6:50] do these things you shall never fall do
[6:53] what add to your faith virtue add to
[6:55] your virtue knowledge add to your
[6:56] knowledge temperance and and there's so
[6:58] there's something you got you you have
[7:00] to be convinced that it's true you have
[7:02] to be
[7:03] you have to make yourself available to
[7:05] god
[7:07] so give diligence means to give careful
[7:09] and persistent work or effort constant
[7:11] and effort to accomplish something
[7:13] there's that ox again laboring you're
[7:15] laboring trying trying to get from point
[7:17] a to p to point b
[7:19] persevering attention like like
[7:21] diligently searching through the through
[7:24] through like a filing cabinet for
[7:25] something or let's say the word of god
[7:28] diligently searching like the bereans
[7:30] did to see if these things be true
[7:33] when you hear something preached it
[7:34] seems a little bit perplexing or whatnot
[7:36] you
[7:37] you want to you want to find out if it's
[7:38] right or not constant and effort
[7:42] and jesus said
[7:44] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[7:46] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[7:49] of course now that this rest is you you
[7:52] you when you're sanctified you're you're
[7:54] laboring and you're in that state of
[7:56] trying to get to a place where you can
[7:58] rest but then christ said that he would
[8:01] give you rest and to take his yoke upon
[8:04] you so that you you could become yoked
[8:06] with him and you know last time we
[8:08] talked about how you can you you know
[8:10] you you think about it if you've ever
[8:12] had to um
[8:13] uh you know the brothers if you ever had
[8:15] to do some kind of heavy lifting or
[8:17] something move a car or push something
[8:18] heavy with a lot of others and maybe
[8:20] there might be one that's not doing
[8:22] their their work and just kind of just
[8:23] kind of acting like it
[8:25] well that's really how it is when you're
[8:27] yoked with christ you look over and
[8:29] you're yoked with him and he's really
[8:31] the one that's pulling all the load
[8:32] because you're yoked with him
[8:34] that's why he says take my yoke upon you
[8:36] and learn to me for i am meek and lowly
[8:38] in heart and you shall find rest unto
[8:40] your souls for my yoke is easy and my
[8:43] burden is light when you get yolked with
[8:45] him now
[8:47] now it's like the cross is lying now to
[8:49] take up your cross and follow me now it
[8:50] becomes a whole lot easier because
[8:53] you're doing it because now you're in
[8:54] love with him and he's revealing his
[8:56] word and you know what your purpose is
[8:57] and you know why you're coming to church
[8:59] and it's not just that you're going
[9:00] through the motions and
[9:02] things but the the word has become alive
[9:05] where it used to be it just was dead
[9:07] works but now it's a living christ in
[9:09] you
[9:10] and it's you and christ together
[9:13] that's why now brother branham and the
[9:14] message desperations he said the token
[9:17] we've talked to the token all the way
[9:19] along now what's the token is the
[9:20] baptism of the holy ghost
[9:23] the lutheran's allowed it to accept in
[9:24] the word accepting christ as personal
[9:26] savior when you get happy enough to
[9:28] shout that's it the pentecostal says
[9:30] speak in tongues then you got it and we
[9:31] find out that all of it was wrong see
[9:33] the token is the token it's you and
[9:35] christ as persons together
[9:38] see us the holy spirit his life in you
[9:40] working his own life through you and
[9:42] that's that's the rest that we're
[9:44] talking about this morning
[9:46] where you know that christ has got you
[9:48] and you got him and you're you're all
[9:50] wrapped in up up together and in that
[9:52] day you shall know that i am in you and
[9:54] you and me and i'm in the father we're
[9:56] all one
[9:58] brother said in christ the mystery of
[10:00] god revealed he said you see the rest of
[10:01] the people living the way they do but
[10:03] yet you do not do it because something's
[10:05] been changed in your soul to take the
[10:07] desire away just to make you live it to
[10:10] make you be able to walk it you're yoked
[10:12] with him
[10:14] now now you're yoked with him my yoke is
[10:16] easy yoked with christ which is with
[10:18] with his word
[10:20] and i do only that which is pleasing to
[10:22] the father he said if you can believe
[10:23] that i am he then believe the word
[10:26] and then so now you're yoked with him
[10:28] and you you labor a little bit
[10:29] differently that's why first corinthians
[10:32] it says we are laborers together with
[10:34] god
[10:35] now now you're laboring to build to
[10:37] to build build yourself up to to to to
[10:40] build up let the word be built up within
[10:42] you
[10:43] now you're laboring that uh preachers
[10:45] labor and preaching the gospel people in
[10:47] church labor that the word can be packed
[10:49] in in their life and come to a place of
[10:51] maturity
[10:52] first corinthians chapter four
[10:54] labor and labor working with our own
[10:57] hands being reviled we bless being
[10:59] persecuted we suffer it in first
[11:01] corinthians 15 but by the grace of god i
[11:04] am what i am and his grace which was
[11:06] bestowed upon me was not in vain but i
[11:08] labored more abundantly than they all
[11:11] yet not i
[11:12] but the grace of god which was in me
[11:15] which was with me see there it is paul's
[11:16] laboring but yet not i the grace of god
[11:20] is god in christ as one in a man in man
[11:23] working like like that type of
[11:26] yoke yourself with christ and you've got
[11:28] christ in himself and you and in
[11:30] colossians 1 29 he said where unto i
[11:33] also labor striving according to his
[11:36] working which worketh in me mightily so
[11:39] there we've got that type of of of you
[11:41] labor to get enter into his rest and
[11:43] then you begin laboring some more and
[11:45] then you come up to come up to maturity
[11:47] to come to up to a place where god can
[11:49] can begin opening up the seals and
[11:51] things to you which is why in second
[11:52] peter he says whereby are given unto us
[11:54] exceeding great and precious promises
[11:56] that by these you might be partakers of
[11:58] the divine nature having escaped the
[12:00] corruption that is in the world through
[12:02] lust and beside this
[12:03] giving all diligence add to your faith
[12:07] giving all diligence
[12:09] but now when
[12:10] after the the little call of baby form
[12:13] sanctification you come to a place where
[12:14] you're resting in god's promise and what
[12:17] he said and it's a you're resting not in
[12:19] something that you did
[12:21] but in what christ did on the cross
[12:23] you're resting resting in the finished
[12:25] work of what god did on the cross
[12:28] so if god if the bible says that he was
[12:30] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[12:32] for our iniquities then you can rest on
[12:34] that that you can rest that there's a
[12:35] promise of healing if the bible says in
[12:38] psalms that that don't forget all the
[12:40] benefits you can rest that there's
[12:41] benefits in the bible if the bible says
[12:44] in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in
[12:46] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[12:47] there's a promise of the baptism the
[12:49] holy ghost you can rest in that so what
[12:51] we're doing we're not resting in a
[12:53] feeling or a sensation or something
[12:54] we're arresting what christ said
[12:57] that's what charles spurgeon said when
[12:59] he said if you rest on the finished work
[13:01] of jesus you have already the best
[13:03] evidence of your salvation in the world
[13:06] you have god's word for it
[13:08] what more is needed what more do you
[13:10] need in what then god said it
[13:13] so now if you go back and examine what
[13:16] what uh what brother ram taught and and
[13:18] you know when everything that brother
[13:20] brown said he would tie back to
[13:21] scripture everything that he said you
[13:24] can take take back to the word and when
[13:26] when he began to talk about rest as he
[13:28] was preaching the hebrews chapter four
[13:29] series or hebrews cherry series he would
[13:32] go back to the old testament to to
[13:35] identify what that rest is in isaiah 28
[13:38] and it might be a little bit small to
[13:40] see so i apologize for that but just
[13:42] maybe maybe just listen as we read
[13:45] through this
[13:47] but you think about think about how many
[13:49] places and what a strange thing it is in
[13:51] the old testament
[13:52] and in the old testament in ezekiel 36
[13:55] and isaiah 28
[13:57] and joel
[13:59] it talks about something that was going
[14:00] to come the baptism the holy ghost but
[14:02] yet they they could not attain to this
[14:04] yet in the old testament but this
[14:06] scripture isaiah 28 and ezekiel 36 and
[14:09] joel was all those things that they
[14:10] talked about were fulfilled on the day
[14:12] of pentecost when the baptism in the
[14:14] holy ghost came
[14:15] now listen listen to how isaiah
[14:17] describes the rest that we're talking
[14:18] about the rest
[14:20] whom shall he teach knowledge
[14:23] how's rest going to come
[14:26] and whom shall he make to understand
[14:28] doctrine because listen when you when
[14:31] you understand the doctrine
[14:33] that's us that's something you can hang
[14:35] your hat on you can hang your soul
[14:38] when you have a revelation of jesus
[14:40] christ
[14:41] when the word opens up
[14:43] and and the picture becomes clear
[14:46] that's something you can rest on
[14:49] whom shall he teach knowledge and whom
[14:50] shall he make to understand doctrine
[14:52] them that are weaned from the milk
[14:54] and drawn from the breasts and brother
[14:55] brown would say you know things like see
[14:57] not not little babies god wants us to
[15:00] get a get us to a place he wants us to
[15:02] position us to where we can understand
[15:05] deep teaching
[15:06] you know i think that's what you know
[15:09] maybe maybe examine ourselves this
[15:10] morning do we want the word
[15:12] eagles eagles want the word
[15:14] because the word is what is going to
[15:16] bring you your rest right
[15:19] for precept must be upon precept
[15:22] you see we quote this a lot of times but
[15:24] maybe maybe this morning just think
[15:26] about this in the context of that is
[15:27] your rest
[15:29] precept must be upon precept
[15:32] precept upon precept
[15:34] line upon line line up online
[15:37] hear a little very low
[15:40] for with stammering lips
[15:43] and another tongue will he speak to this
[15:45] people
[15:46] i think about that i was fulfilled on
[15:48] the day of pentecost
[15:51] to whom he said this is the rest
[15:54] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[15:56] rest and this is the refreshing
[15:58] yet they will not hear
[16:00] but the word of the lord was unto them
[16:02] precept upon precept precept upon
[16:05] precept
[16:06] lying upon line line upon line to hear a
[16:09] little and their little that they might
[16:11] go and fall backward and be broken and
[16:13] snared and taken how would you be snared
[16:15] because because the word comes just a
[16:17] little bit here a little bit there and
[16:18] people get confused about things it
[16:20] looks like some in some places the word
[16:22] contradicts itself
[16:23] but when the revelation comes
[16:26] everything fits together
[16:27] just like for example matthew 28 19
[16:30] looks like it contradicts acts 2 38
[16:32] but when when it come when the spirit
[16:34] reveals itself like reveals the word
[16:37] just like it was revealed on the day of
[16:38] pentecost when peter came
[16:40] bolton out of that upper room and said
[16:43] this is that and begin to identify
[16:46] the correct way to be baptized not in
[16:48] the name of titles not in titles but in
[16:50] the name of jesus christ because he had
[16:53] a revelation of who jesus christ was
[16:56] you see how you see how you can be
[16:58] baptized wrong because you don't know
[17:00] who it is you're being baptized how to
[17:02] be baptized but to know who jesus christ
[17:05] is give you the correct way to be
[17:07] baptized to go down in the water in the
[17:09] name
[17:11] in the name of the father son and holy
[17:13] ghost which is jesus christ
[17:16] and so that's that's rest
[17:18] that's rest
[17:19] this is the rest where whether you may
[17:21] cause the weary to rest and this is the
[17:24] refreshing and seeing that are
[17:25] refreshing when you have confidence in
[17:28] what you believe
[17:29] and not to be confused not to go around
[17:31] wandering from this post to this post
[17:33] from this church to that church but to
[17:35] know what you believe
[17:39] you know what a precept is as a general
[17:41] rule intended to regulate behavior or
[17:43] thought
[17:44] and as we were studying on wednesday
[17:46] night and the greatest battle ever
[17:47] fought brother adam was talking about
[17:48] how that when you receive the word these
[17:51] little precepts align upon line it
[17:54] actually opens up a channel between you
[17:56] and god for his spirit to work through
[17:57] you and so as you receive these word and
[18:00] you the word the word goes forth and you
[18:02] say i believe that
[18:04] then because god will not violate your
[18:06] free will he won't override your free
[18:08] will so he wants you to accept it and
[18:10] when you accept it it allows him to
[18:12] begin to operate in your life
[18:14] that's why in romans chapter 12 it says
[18:16] be not conformed to this world
[18:18] but be transformed by the renewing of
[18:21] your mind
[18:22] that you may prove what is that good and
[18:24] acceptable and perfect will of god and
[18:26] so you as you receive the word the word
[18:28] is actually transforming your thinking
[18:30] and transforming your actions and
[18:32] transforming the way the way that you
[18:34] behave and renewing your mind and i've
[18:36] got this like this little ladder that's
[18:38] going up to kind of show that as you add
[18:41] line up online it's taking you higher
[18:44] and higher into a relationship with
[18:45] christ
[18:47] precept upon precept so brother branham
[18:49] said he said now what's the sabbath the
[18:52] sabbath rest
[18:53] not not a day that we set aside anymore
[18:56] but the new testament sabbath is a
[18:59] perpetual resting in christ
[19:01] because he sent his holy ghost
[19:03] into the church to give you an
[19:05] understanding to give you peace
[19:08] to give you a peace in a time of trouble
[19:09] just like jesus in that boat when the
[19:12] winds were rocking it but yet he was
[19:13] resting and who he knew he was and what
[19:16] his purpose was he was resting in the
[19:18] promise of god
[19:20] not worldly knowledge but spiritual
[19:23] knowledge who shall he teach knowledge
[19:25] as isaiah 28 says whom shall he make
[19:28] understand doctrine
[19:30] oh bless god our organization don't
[19:31] believe this they wouldn't put up with
[19:33] that as many of the organizations say
[19:35] today but if you can find somebody that
[19:37] will accept god's word they'll be able
[19:39] to enter into god's rest
[19:42] what does god's word say about it
[19:45] oh well our pastors you know are
[19:46] educated oh sure certainly got so much
[19:49] education they left god out of it
[19:51] truly for you can tell them the word and
[19:53] they'll walk around and say
[19:55] well i don't believe it just that way
[19:59] so you can see how the sabbath rest does
[20:01] not come by education
[20:03] education is like like cane that sitting
[20:06] there would buy education education say
[20:08] well i know how i need to get my offer
[20:11] i'm going to bring up some fruit of the
[20:13] fields i'm going to bring some grapes
[20:14] and some stuff that i've harvested but
[20:16] that was that's what you get with
[20:18] education so it doesn't come by by just
[20:20] somebody just laying out things so that
[20:23] you know it's maybe maybe plain by
[20:25] intellectual understanding but it comes
[20:27] by a revelation because abel saw what it
[20:30] really was by revelation what what what
[20:33] had happened in the garden and he come
[20:35] up there with a lamb and offered a
[20:37] bloody sacrifice because he had a
[20:39] revelation and that's what he was
[20:41] resting in
[20:42] a revelation
[20:44] of what his purpose was and how to get
[20:46] back how to get back to god it was
[20:48] revealed to him
[20:51] and brother adam said in the christ the
[20:52] mystery god revealed he said remember
[20:54] the sabbath day keep it holy one day in
[20:56] the week
[20:57] now he magnified it the rest comes from
[21:00] keeping the spirit of god
[21:02] precept upon precept and lying upon the
[21:04] line here little and there little hold
[21:06] fast that was good for with stammering
[21:08] lips and other tongues will i speak to
[21:10] this people
[21:11] and that is the rest
[21:13] that's the refreshing from the presence
[21:15] of the lord
[21:17] and yet they would not hear it and
[21:18] wagged their heads and walked away for
[21:21] their denominations
[21:23] in that exactly what they did when jesus
[21:24] was on earth with the pharisees and
[21:26] sadducees they didn't want they hear the
[21:28] things the deep things that jesus was
[21:30] saying like except you eat my flesh and
[21:32] drink my blood or i and my father are
[21:34] one they didn't want to hear all that so
[21:36] they wanted to stay with their their
[21:38] denominational idea
[21:40] but when truth comes
[21:42] truth comes if you'll receive it it's a
[21:43] real rest
[21:45] what is the holy ghost
[21:46] brother graham priest in 1959 he said
[21:48] somebody keeping a sabbath day i'm not
[21:50] rejecting or making light of anybody's
[21:52] church or religion but said the sabbath
[21:54] day the sabbath of god was the rest day
[21:57] here's the rest day this is the rest he
[22:00] said that you cause the weary to rest
[22:03] it'll be precept upon precept lying upon
[22:06] line
[22:07] there's the rest
[22:09] what is the holy ghost
[22:11] the rest
[22:12] come unto me all you that labor and are
[22:14] heavy laden and i'll give you rest
[22:17] how because you get yoked up with christ
[22:20] and he starts pulling the labor hit by
[22:22] the burden he's the one doing all the
[22:24] work for you
[22:25] what what does that mean he's the one
[22:27] that changes your desire to dress
[22:29] differently to look differently to not
[22:31] look like the world he takes away that
[22:33] desire
[22:34] to drink and smoke and all that stuff
[22:36] that you used to do
[22:37] and and and to address like uh like a
[22:40] barbarian and changes you changes your
[22:43] nature and now you're yoked with him and
[22:46] what used to be a labor is now a
[22:48] pleasure because you're in love with
[22:50] christ
[22:54] what is he the one that comes in you
[22:56] gives you peace your sign your comforter
[22:59] comforted at rest sealed
[23:02] it's a sign the world knows something's
[23:04] happened to you
[23:06] what is it a seal you're at rest
[23:09] if something happens to you there's
[23:10] something there to make an advocate for
[23:12] you right quick see making intersections
[23:15] it's the spirit of god living in the
[23:17] church prophesied exactly what it would
[23:20] be when it come
[23:21] it would be an everlasting eternal rest
[23:24] because this rest is something that
[23:26] nobody can take away from you
[23:28] once god gives it to you it's there
[23:30] forever
[23:32] what is the new birthing and brother ram
[23:33] said in christ the mystery god revealed
[23:36] you'd say well brother brown what is the
[23:38] new birth
[23:39] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[23:42] personally to you
[23:43] and no matter what anybody says
[23:45] what takes place
[23:47] whether you get sick whether you have a
[23:49] bad day at work
[23:50] whether things are going rough whether
[23:51] your family leaves you and deserts you
[23:53] well no matter what takes place it's
[23:55] christ
[23:57] pastor priest whatever it might be it's
[23:59] christ in you that is the revelation
[24:01] that the church was built upon
[24:03] the new birth is christ is a revelation
[24:06] god has revealed to you this great
[24:08] mystery
[24:09] and that's a new birth
[24:11] and the musicians can go ahead and come
[24:12] forward
[24:13] and we'll stop on this note when ruth
[24:16] was resting it was a type of the church
[24:19] resting in the promises of god
[24:21] we have the earnest now of our salvation
[24:24] we're not worried
[24:26] whether we're going over there or not
[24:28] we're going
[24:29] god promised it and we've got the
[24:31] earnest
[24:32] all we have to do is just wait
[24:35] we have the earnest of it right now
[24:37] waiting
[24:38] for the time that when he comes back
[24:41] when you got that rest all you got to do
[24:43] was wait on god to fulfill his word
[24:46] and we'll stop there
[24:50] [Applause]
[25:13] you
