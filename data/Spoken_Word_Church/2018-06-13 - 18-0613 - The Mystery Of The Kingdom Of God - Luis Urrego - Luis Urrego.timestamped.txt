[1:38] supposed to do so let's just sing open
[1:40] the eyes of my heart as brother Lewis
[1:42] comes to bring the word of the Lord unto
[1:43] us opening eyes
[1:49] open Eli's of my I want to see I wanna
[2:00] see
[2:05] open the eyes of my heart
[2:12] [Music]
[2:14] what'd you say
[2:20] to see you too
[2:26] [Music]
[2:29] sorry
[2:34] [Music]
[2:38] Oh
[2:49] shiny
[2:54] to power as we say
[3:02] [Music]
[3:11] Oh
[3:14] Oh
[3:15] [Music]
[3:19] I want to see
[3:23] praise the Lord Jesus are you happy to
[3:26] be the house of God I trust that you are
[3:28] and I am happy to be back on the saddle
[3:32] weights as good beep to have me back
[3:36] it's good to be back but dick is good to
[3:40] see your face again yeah
[3:47] it's good to see everybody and you know
[3:53] I brought something I don't know where I
[3:55] put it I think I might have left it in
[3:56] there it's a bottle of water brother
[3:59] Darrell is so good to see you it's such
[4:01] a bad surprise and I trust everyone on
[4:04] your end is doing well praise the Lord
[4:06] and all the other brothers his kids good
[4:09] to see you all thank you brother
[4:13] you'd have anointed it there I
[4:16] appreciate everyone's prayers while we
[4:18] were gone and of course you know my
[4:20] father-in-law he he passed away and and
[4:22] he was sick and he lives in Canada so it
[4:25] was kind of a situation to where we knew
[4:29] that that he was gone we just didn't
[4:31] know when and so we just couldn't drive
[4:33] all the way up there 16 hour drive and
[4:36] then you know nothing happened then we'd
[4:39] come right back and maybe in the middle
[4:41] of us coming back then we have to go you
[4:43] know but so we just kind of had to stick
[4:45] around and the Lord had his head his way
[4:47] I believe
[4:49] I appreciate all the prayers that you
[4:51] made for us my wife I believe she's been
[4:54] strengthened by those prayers and so
[4:56] thank you thank you for that most of all
[5:00] I believe that what strengthened her is
[5:03] that you know of course the pastor there
[5:05] he talked to my father-in-law he wasn't
[5:08] a Christian but he talked to my
[5:10] father-in-law's a week before again and
[5:12] I know in the last two years the Lord
[5:14] has really been soft softening him up
[5:16] really been humbling him really been and
[5:19] he's been more humble more receptive to
[5:21] the word and so I believe God was doing
[5:24] the work in his life whether he said it
[5:27] he said it you know I believe God was
[5:29] doing something in here and so I trust
[5:31] that right now he's at rest and that's
[5:33] where we should believe in that
[5:34] we're gonna believe it either way he was
[5:37] good to the bride that's for sure it was
[5:40] good to us and he cooked for the church
[5:42] and things like that and he did it with
[5:44] all his heart and but I believe he's in
[5:47] he's at rest right now with my
[5:48] mother-in-law who was a believer so
[5:50] praise God I mean I thank you thank you
[5:53] all for your prayers amen praise the
[5:55] Lord and so we're just gonna go ahead
[5:57] and go straight to the word I don't want
[5:59] to take up too much time so let's just
[6:06] let's just read read Matthew chapter 3
[6:10] and verse 2 Matthew chapter 3 verse 2
[6:13] and then we'll read Matthew chapter 7
[6:19] chapter 4 verse 17 it says Matthew 3
[6:28] verse 1 it says in those days Came John
[6:29] the Baptist preaching in the wilderness
[6:31] of Judea and verse 2 it says and saying
[6:35] repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is
[6:37] at hand amen and then in Matthew chapter
[6:39] 4 verse 17 says from that time Jesus
[6:44] began to preach and to say repent for
[6:48] the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[6:51] praise God let's just bow our heads this
[6:52] this evening our Heavenly Father we
[6:55] thank you Lord Jesus once again for the
[6:56] opportunity to minister your word Lord
[6:59] God we know father God that we are our
[7:02] lips aren't worthy Lord Jesus to even
[7:04] speak these great things father God but
[7:06] Lord you made us worthy Lord through
[7:08] your Holy Spirit Lord God father God and
[7:10] I just thank you Lord that that we have
[7:12] the opportunity Lord Jesus to be able to
[7:14] to minister to to your bride father God
[7:18] who you have purchased father God
[7:20] through your blood Lord Jesus and father
[7:22] we just ask that you to help us to just
[7:24] get aside Lord help out get all
[7:27] nervousness out and everything Lord
[7:29] Jesus and you have your way with us this
[7:31] evening Lord father God we invite your
[7:33] presence Lord in our midst father God
[7:35] because if you're not here Lord then
[7:37] we're here in vain Lord but we believe
[7:39] that you're here because your word
[7:40] declared it father where there's two or
[7:42] three gathered in your name there
[7:44] we'll be in are there myths so we're
[7:47] just confiding and believing that father
[7:49] God we love you and we pray that you'd
[7:51] meet every need amongst us Lord and
[7:53] father God have your way with us in your
[7:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[7:57] amen amen
[7:59] praise God Saints you may be seated
[8:01] praise the Lord
[8:03] mm-hmm and just before before I forget I
[8:07] just want to ask you all Sunday we my
[8:10] wife put in a prayer request for her
[8:13] older sister her name is Nova and up in
[8:17] Canada and she's just just a special
[8:21] prayer request for her and her family
[8:23] and we just ask you all that you all
[8:25] just remember that it really God knows
[8:27] all about it just not at liberty right
[8:30] now to speak about the details but just
[8:32] pray for her and pray and pray that God
[8:34] would just work all that out as he
[8:37] desires I mean I believe God's doing
[8:38] something right now and so and so we
[8:41] just we would covet your prayers for
[8:43] that a man for her name is Nova just
[8:46] like the star Nova amen praise the Lord
[8:49] so thanks we want to we want to speak
[8:52] this morning or this deceiving a topic
[8:55] the mystery of the kingdom of God you
[8:58] just give it a title and back in March I
[9:03] gave a series of five-part series in the
[9:05] adult Sunday School downstairs and and
[9:09] so I felt led as I was going and you
[9:12] know just looking at some things I felt
[9:15] led to just come back and revisit this
[9:17] because not all of you were there and
[9:19] maybe may not have heard what was spoken
[9:22] and so this would give you opportunity
[9:25] to hear amen and have you've heard it
[9:27] then you're hear it again amen because I
[9:29] mean sometimes like I've said before
[9:31] sometimes we might hear something maybe
[9:33] a sunday-school
[9:34] brother Dale brother wait somebody might
[9:36] be preaching if and we may not get it
[9:38] right there and then but then but then
[9:40] three months down the road maybe another
[9:43] brother comes in or the same brother
[9:44] preaches the same thing in boom God
[9:47] gives you a rebel a
[9:48] amen so the word is the word Amen praise
[9:51] God that's the that's the key you know
[9:53] the word is the word and if it needs to
[9:56] be repeated
[9:57] Amen that means you need it that means
[10:01] you haven't gotten it the first time
[10:03] Amen because remember God is God
[10:06] speaking through us Amen if you believe
[10:08] in that fivefold ministry that God is
[10:10] using a thoughtful ministry in this hour
[10:11] then it's God working through that
[10:13] fivefold ministry Amen and it's God
[10:15] given you Amen God given me what I need
[10:19] amen praise God Amen so we want to we
[10:23] want to try to work with this PowerPoint
[10:25] presentation and I know last time we did
[10:27] a lot we did some some preaching and
[10:30] stumped on toes and I know I stumped on
[10:33] my own toes and but you know what we all
[10:36] needed it amen
[10:37] so I just hope that you know I just need
[10:41] we just need more of God in this hour
[10:43] right man thanks guys so tonight we're
[10:45] gonna try to bring it come down and just
[10:47] kind of do a little bit of teaching amen
[10:49] we'll see how the Lord leads amen so I
[10:51] titled this back there back at that time
[10:53] I said is the kingdom of God is it
[10:55] external or internal amen and well as we
[11:00] go along you know we'll we'll see what
[11:02] that means because a lot of people make
[11:04] the kingdom of God as an internal thing
[11:06] which I believe it but also sometimes
[11:10] make it external as well and they're
[11:12] they're they're gun ho about it being an
[11:14] external you know but we'll see we'll
[11:17] see what what it's all about let's go to
[11:19] the next slide amen
[11:20] now the phrase the kingdom of God
[11:22] started to be used at the time of John
[11:24] that's reason why we read that that that
[11:26] John the Baptist come and the phrase is
[11:29] used interchangeably with the phrases
[11:31] the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom and
[11:34] if you all want a copy of this
[11:36] PowerPoint presentation just so that you
[11:38] can have all these all these verse all
[11:41] these scriptures and all these quotes
[11:42] you're more than welcome to this is
[11:45] there's no copyright on this no
[11:47] copyright on the word I was in Nicaragua
[11:49] went down and I preached the word there
[11:51] on the mirror and I had the mirror and
[11:53] what brother came up to me and said I
[11:54] love that missus and he said he says
[11:56] their copyright on it I said no brother
[11:58] you take it
[11:59] there's no copyright on the word amen
[12:03] now it was first used in Matthew chapter
[12:06] 3 verse 2 and then in Matthew chapter 3
[12:09] verse 1 which we already read so we'll
[12:11] go ahead and just keep going through and
[12:13] we'll circle and I'll try not to keep
[12:15] you all along this evening amen
[12:17] praise God next amen now the word key
[12:24] kingdom kingdom of God if you look at up
[12:28] in in the in in the the concordance it
[12:34] means royal power kingship Dominion rule
[12:38] not to be confused with an actual
[12:40] kingdom that's interesting but rather
[12:45] the right or authority to rule over a
[12:47] team right amen now that's that's key
[12:51] amen praise God so just remember that
[12:54] amen next slide and Matthew chapter 6
[13:00] but this is where Jesus was talking
[13:03] about let's just read in Matthew chapter
[13:07] 6 verse 25 therefore I say unto you take
[13:09] no thought for your life when you shall
[13:11] eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for
[13:13] your body what you shall put on is not
[13:15] the life more than meat and the body
[13:17] more than raiment amen behold the fowls
[13:20] of the air for they sow not neither do
[13:22] they reap nor gather into barns yet our
[13:24] heavenly Father feedeth them in other
[13:25] words they're not out there laboring and
[13:27] working and toiling like we do but yet
[13:31] our heavenly Father feeds them amen are
[13:33] you not much better than they Jesus s
[13:36] right which of you by taking thought or
[13:40] in other words by by thinking I can do a
[13:42] little bit more can add one cubit unto
[13:44] your stature right maybe you know
[13:48] playing basketball over but obviously
[13:51] you can't God's already determined they
[13:54] meant and verse 20 and why take ye
[13:56] thought for raiment amen in other words
[13:59] why take you thought for your clothes
[14:01] right consider the lilies of the field
[14:05] how they grow they told not neither do
[14:07] they spin have you ever looked at a
[14:09] flower outside or even
[14:11] blade of grass you know I heard
[14:14] something the brother branham's say
[14:15] something the other day is that we can
[14:18] send people to the outer space we can
[14:20] send rockets to the moon or outer space
[14:22] and they've got the signs for that but
[14:26] yet they have not been able to explain
[14:27] one blade of grass how a one blade of
[14:29] grass is made everything they can't make
[14:33] one amen so if God is God's tell Jesus
[14:38] telling us don't be concerned about
[14:39] these things because if Jesus is all you
[14:42] know he created the grass he created the
[14:43] flower look how beautiful they look we
[14:46] trampled on them Tom is no more we track
[14:52] I felt it was kind of loose
[14:54] we trampled on the things and yet we
[14:57] don't even think what is involved in
[14:59] these things amen and then Jesus tells
[15:01] us not to worry and says and yea I say
[15:03] unto you that even Solomon in all his
[15:06] glory was not arrayed like one of these
[15:07] next wherefore if God so clothes the
[15:10] grass of the field which today is and
[15:12] tomorrow let's just skip down to verse
[15:14] 32 it says for after all these things do
[15:19] the Gentiles seek including including
[15:22] what we shall eat right so he was
[15:25] speaking to us right after all these
[15:28] things the Gentiles seek for your
[15:29] heavenly Father knows that all you have
[15:31] need of all these things right I'm so
[15:34] thankful that he does a man that he
[15:36] knows your needs he knows exactly what
[15:38] you have need of a man physically and
[15:41] spiritually and he always gives such
[15:44] food in due season amen
[15:46] just in time he's never late amen and
[15:50] then and then verse 33 but says but seek
[15:53] ye first the kingdom of God now Jesus
[15:57] could have said but seek ye the kingdom
[15:58] of God but he said seek ye first the
[16:01] kingdom of God in other words anything
[16:05] that you're going to be involved in
[16:06] anything that you're going to
[16:09] you know get get involved with right put
[16:12] God first God what is it that you want
[16:15] me to be to do with this how where do
[16:18] you want to go with this put him in
[16:19] first place he already knows about it
[16:22] but he wants you to recognize that if he
[16:24] put him before you he'll always fight
[16:27] your battles he'll always say men he'll
[16:29] always be there for you and seek you
[16:32] first the kingdom of God and His
[16:33] righteousness and all these things food
[16:35] raiment all these things shall be added
[16:37] unto you
[16:37] right amen so I put this I put this here
[16:41] because as we're progressing through
[16:44] this with as in talking about the
[16:45] kingdom of God this is how important
[16:48] Jesus made the kingdom of God to be it's
[16:51] gotta be the first thing in your life
[16:53] amen
[16:54] it's got to be the first thing in your
[16:57] life amen amen so let's move on to the
[17:00] next verse our next slide now brother
[17:03] next slide
[17:04] my brother Brown says here in the smyrna
[17:06] church age here is where you have to
[17:08] believe again in the love and goodness
[17:09] and wisdom of god this too is needful
[17:11] remember he admonished take no thought
[17:14] for tomorrow what you shall eat or what
[17:16] ye shall put on for your father knoweth
[17:18] the things you have need of he who
[17:20] clothes the lily and feeds the sparrows
[17:22] shall do much more for you these
[17:25] physical things are not the true basic
[17:27] necessities of your life for a man's
[17:29] life consisteth not of the things he
[17:31] possesses but rather seek ye first the
[17:34] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[17:35] all material necessities will be added
[17:37] unto you
[17:38] amen next slide amen and well I won't
[17:41] read all this but said the people of God
[17:42] are not material minded they are Christ
[17:45] minded amen
[17:47] they do not seek the treasures that are
[17:49] below they seek those that are above
[17:50] amen praise God so let's move on like I
[17:53] said if you want a copy of this then you
[17:55] more than welcome to have one now Jesus
[17:59] this passage here in Luke chapter 18
[18:02] verse 28 then Peter said lo we have left
[18:05] all and followed thee and Jesus replies
[18:08] to them and says and he said unto them
[18:10] verily I say unto you there is no man
[18:12] that hath left house or parents or
[18:14] brethren or wife or children for the
[18:16] kingdom of God's sake who shall not
[18:18] receive manifold
[18:20] more in this present time and in the
[18:22] world to come life everlasting
[18:25] now you may think you may look at these
[18:27] scriptures you like how I read that
[18:29] since I was a little boy you know a
[18:30] little girl you know I've read these
[18:32] scriptures but if we if you pay
[18:34] attention and you start looking at what
[18:36] the kingdom of God really is you'll
[18:38] start seeing these scriptures in a
[18:40] different way because if you give up mom
[18:44] and dad if you give up your children
[18:48] even wife for the sake of the kingdom of
[18:52] God there's a big blessing for you amen
[18:56] there's a blessing and I stole for that
[18:58] God don't forget that amen because
[19:01] remember even job even joke did that
[19:04] right at the time you know he wasn't
[19:06] gonna give up God to do whatever his
[19:09] wife was asking them to you know curse
[19:12] God and die he said no you speak as a
[19:14] foolish woman he said but I'll stay with
[19:17] God and you know what God restored him
[19:19] restored his health and restored all his
[19:21] family back the Bible says that's
[19:25] powerful right I was in the Old
[19:27] Testament hey man
[19:30] praise God how much more under this this
[19:33] meant this dispensation of grace amen
[19:35] praise God next slide because you know
[19:38] sometimes Saints Satan wants to take our
[19:42] time you know and I gave an example
[19:45] downstairs I said you know sometimes I
[19:47] have I have just to just to bring it
[19:49] down home you might have a but you say
[19:52] Lord I want to go pray and then you if
[19:55] you have children in the house something
[19:57] happens the attention is diverted or
[19:59] your your wife needed something and then
[20:01] you get caught up in that and then all
[20:03] of a sudden it's it's midnight and you
[20:06] didn't get your prayer time and now
[20:07] you're sleepy seek ye first the kingdom
[20:11] of God amen praise God now so is the
[20:16] kingdom of God external what the kingdom
[20:18] of God is not let's talk about what the
[20:20] kingdom of God is not a minute in John
[20:22] chapter 6 says verse 14 says then those
[20:26] men when they had seen the miracle that
[20:28] Jesus did these are Jews they
[20:30] man said this is of a truth that profit
[20:33] that should come into the world when
[20:35] Jesus therefore perceived that they
[20:37] would come and take him by force to make
[20:40] him a king he departed again into a
[20:43] mountain himself alone so the Jews we
[20:46] know that the Jews back then they were
[20:48] looking for a kingdom they wanted the
[20:51] glory days of Solomon to return the
[20:55] golden days of Solomon to return and
[20:57] they wanted somebody politically to come
[20:59] down the corridors of heaven and step in
[21:02] kay if it's a seat and stopped out the
[21:04] Romans and bring back rule again again
[21:08] the way they bathe they and they they
[21:11] thought that that's how the Messiah was
[21:12] going to come but Jesus didn't come to
[21:15] establish a physical Kingdom that wasn't
[21:18] his intention he will have a physical
[21:21] Kingdom but it's got to be internal
[21:23] first amen praise God let's get this
[21:26] move on to the next slide now these are
[21:29] other other other scriptures Luke 19 for
[21:32] the Son of man has come to seek and to
[21:34] save that which was lost and as they
[21:37] heard these things he added in spake a
[21:39] parable because he was not to Jerusalem
[21:41] and because they thought that the
[21:42] kingdom of God should immediately appear
[21:45] so they thought that the kingdom of God
[21:47] in their perception should immediately
[21:50] appear amen
[21:52] now let us skip that next slide in Luke
[21:57] chapter 17 verse 20 and says and when he
[22:00] and when he was demanded of the
[22:02] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[22:04] come he answered them and said the
[22:07] kingdom of God cometh not with
[22:09] observation now this is a key verse amen
[22:12] now I'm putting it right here because
[22:15] there later all we're gonna refer to it
[22:16] again amen the kingdom of God what that
[22:20] means is the kingdom of God is not
[22:22] something that you see right verse 21
[22:27] says neither shall they say lo here or
[22:30] lo there for behold the kingdom of God
[22:33] is within you now this is Jesus speaking
[22:36] about this even before him it come down
[22:40] as they're in the form of the Holy Ghost
[22:42] right the kingdom of God is within you
[22:44] he had not died yet when he went when he
[22:47] said those words right amen next let's
[22:53] see and when the acts 1 verse 6 when
[22:56] they therefore would come together they
[22:57] asked of him saying Lord will doubt this
[22:59] time restore again the kingdom to Israel
[23:00] he said unto them it is not for you to
[23:03] know the times or the seasons which the
[23:05] father hath put in his own power but ye
[23:08] shall receive
[23:09] look how Jesus just kind of puts it back
[23:12] amen they're looking for something
[23:14] physical but Jesus is talking something
[23:15] spiritual verse 8 he says but ye shall
[23:19] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[23:21] has come upon you so they're talking
[23:24] about a physical Kingdom he's talking
[23:26] about the Holy Ghost right and ye shall
[23:31] be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[23:33] and all Judea and in Samaria unto the
[23:35] uttermost parts of the earth so what is
[23:38] this kingdom of God that Jesus talking
[23:40] about right praise God let's go to the
[23:43] next next one
[23:44] amen John chapter 18 then this is when
[23:47] when when Jesus was before Pilate and
[23:50] just let's look let's look at this I'm
[23:53] sorry I'm doing a lot of reading but we
[23:55] come to the house of God and the word
[23:56] has to be preached right amen
[23:59] then Pilate entered into the judgment
[24:02] Hall again and called Jesus and said
[24:04] unto Him art thou the king of the Jews
[24:07] and look how Jesus replies to him jesus
[24:10] answered him say it out this thing of
[24:12] thyself or did others tell thee of me
[24:14] in other words do you have a revelation
[24:17] of Who I am
[24:18] or somebody just tell you about it and
[24:21] you're just repeating what they said
[24:23] it's pretty much what Jesus is saying
[24:25] amen verse 35 says Pilate answered am i
[24:29] a Jew thine own nation and the chief
[24:31] priests have delivered thee unto me what
[24:33] has thou done next jesus answered look
[24:38] up jesus answers in verse 36 my kingdom
[24:41] is not of this world
[24:44] amen if my kingdom were of this world
[24:48] then with my servants fight right that I
[24:52] should not be delivered to the Jews
[24:55] but now is my kingdom not from hence
[24:58] amen
[24:59] so then verse 37 Pilate therefore said
[25:03] unto Him art thou a king then jesus
[25:06] answered thou sayest that I am a king to
[25:08] this and was I born and for this cause
[25:10] came I into the world that I should bear
[25:12] witness look at this
[25:14] on to the truth that he should bear
[25:17] witness unto the truth every one that is
[25:20] of the truth in other words my subjects
[25:23] right my subjects every one that is of
[25:27] the truth in other words of that Kingdom
[25:29] heareth my voice amen now here there was
[25:35] Jesus standing in front of Pilate Pilate
[25:38] was hearing jesus's voice physically but
[25:44] yet he wasn't hearing it amen
[25:49] because look what look what Pilate
[25:51] replies Pilate saith unto Him what is
[25:53] truth in other words what is truth you
[25:59] know and the truth the kingdom was
[26:02] standing right in front of him and
[26:05] that's how close it is Saints that we
[26:08] could miss it the kingdom of God is so
[26:12] simple so so so so sometimes Jesus was
[26:17] right there bound maybe maybe blood and
[26:20] things come in all over they look so it
[26:22] how could that be truth how could that
[26:24] be the kingdom of God how could that be
[26:26] and you could miss it for a million
[26:28] miles amen it's so humble it's so it's
[26:32] so
[26:32] a simple because let me tell you Saints
[26:35] as you're growing more in the word amen
[26:37] as you're as you're feeding on the word
[26:39] amen I believe as I was telling my wife
[26:42] today God becomes more simple amen God
[26:46] doesn't become more complicated amen
[26:48] God is a simple God if you continue amen
[26:52] reading and feeding the word on the word
[26:53] amen the more you feed on the word the
[26:56] more simple he gets
[26:58] [Applause]
[27:00] but some people they're like I don't
[27:02] know I can't get into all those messages
[27:05] that brother Brenna preached and I can't
[27:06] I don't know about the statue the
[27:08] perfect medic why don't you try reading
[27:10] why don't you try reading and studying
[27:12] the stature of a man or reading the word
[27:15] a man and see yeah you see my goodness
[27:17] God is simple right when God really
[27:20] gives you a revelation hey man that's
[27:23] what brother Branham preached that
[27:24] message they may God revealed in
[27:25] simplicity hey man praise God
[27:28] next slide amen so we see that it's
[27:31] established that Jesus did not come to
[27:33] establish a physical Kingdom that was
[27:36] not his purpose but yet while the people
[27:39] were asking these things of him he's
[27:42] talking about a kingdom anyways
[27:44] something that you cannot see amen
[27:47] now brother Brown says here in the
[27:49] message the unity of one of one God in
[27:52] the one Church 1958 God's kingdom is not
[27:55] of this earth God's kingdom is in our
[27:58] hearts it's the spiritual Kingdom that
[28:02] we're born into it amen that's key we're
[28:06] born into it jesus said the kingdom of
[28:09] God comes but without not without
[28:11] violence
[28:12] believing meant without observation and
[28:14] the kingdom of God is within you
[28:18] all right the Holy Spirit God's kingdom
[28:22] moving in the man and governing and
[28:25] controlling him that's the kingdom
[28:27] that's the that's the kingdom that Jesus
[28:30] was telling Pilate and say if my
[28:32] subjects were of this kingdom there you
[28:34] know they would fight for me but because
[28:36] my subjects are not of that Kingdom
[28:37] they're not fighting for me man
[28:39] therefore the word had because the word
[28:41] had to be fulfilled right what if angels
[28:45] came and rescued Jesus from dying and
[28:47] things like that the word would not be
[28:49] fulfilled but God is so so once that
[28:52] word to be fulfilled amen they did that
[28:55] it had to be that way you see
[28:57] praise God so you're the subjects of
[28:59] this kingdom
[29:00] a man will hear his voice of the
[29:03] spiritual king right
[29:05] amen next slide
[29:09] now in Romans chapter 14 verse 17 for
[29:13] the kingdom of God is not meat and drink
[29:15] but righteousness and peace and joy in
[29:18] the Holy Ghost amen
[29:20] now I just want to say if we could just
[29:23] read just a few verses from Romans
[29:25] chapter 14 amen I'm not gonna read if
[29:31] you want all the details and things you
[29:32] can go back to those to those videos on
[29:35] that we did on Sunday school but just
[29:37] bringing it bringing it down just a
[29:39] little bit amen how many love the Lord
[29:46] Prisca this is still stains Saints is
[29:52] the kingdom of God external what the
[29:54] kingdom of God is not right amen
[29:58] because unfortunately a lot of people in
[30:00] the message have made it something
[30:02] external do's and don'ts and hair and
[30:05] all kinds of stuff we believe in those
[30:07] things but that's not that's not the
[30:09] message that's not what that's not what
[30:13] brother brother Brennan that wasn't the
[30:15] culmination of the message because the
[30:19] Pentecostals had that right the
[30:22] Pentecostals of your data happy women
[30:24] with their hair long and land and and
[30:26] decently dressed amen
[30:28] but God God had to restore that back
[30:31] amen to to the to us amen so that way
[30:35] the message could come forth their true
[30:37] message amen praise God so God wasn't
[30:41] forgetting about these things that's why
[30:43] we don't forget about the the physical
[30:46] things amen praise God
[30:48] but you know in order for you to do the
[30:50] physical you have to have it eternally
[30:51] first what is it what is it that you
[30:55] sisters have long hair but yet you talk
[30:57] about the whole church this is you have
[31:00] a long tongue you know you have long
[31:03] hair dragging all the way to the floor
[31:05] but you have a long tongue what is that
[31:07] you know you haven't been born again are
[31:10] you brothers you know doing what you
[31:12] know smoking cigarettes in your house
[31:15] and you're at church and doing things
[31:17] you know what is it that you need to be
[31:19] born again
[31:20] all right praise God so verse let's just
[31:25] start I just start at verse one Amen
[31:29] well I'll see we're all right him that
[31:34] is weak in the faith receive ye but not
[31:37] to doubtful disputations now I I looked
[31:42] up today I looked up that word
[31:45] disputations because Paula Paul clearly
[31:52] tells us say men that these things are
[31:55] not beneficial to unto us right amen
[31:59] doubtful disputations in it and and this
[32:02] is what this is what that means if this
[32:05] decides to come up i meant to print
[32:08] these out but anyways it means it means
[32:12] arguing's
[32:13] why and things like that right things
[32:15] that really are not sedimented that we
[32:19] don't we don't find in the word we find
[32:22] in the word where women should have long
[32:24] hair they should not wear this you're
[32:25] not wearing garment that pertains to a
[32:27] man a man should have short hair we see
[32:30] those things a men in the in the
[32:32] scripture but then sometimes we fuss and
[32:34] fight about things that we're not even
[32:35] in the word and yet you bring them as
[32:37] doctrine you become it's become doctrine
[32:40] in your life amen that's what that's
[32:43] what Paul was talking about doubtful
[32:44] disputations they meant something that
[32:46] you'd it's not really in the word it's
[32:48] just your own thing right praise God so
[32:51] that's what it says here it says it's
[32:55] the disputations is the word Diallo he's
[32:58] mas in greek and it says the thinking of
[33:01] them it means the thinking of a man
[33:02] deliberating with himself a thought in
[33:05] word reasoning purpose design a
[33:09] deliberating questioning about what is
[33:11] true hesitation doubting disputing
[33:14] arguing so that's the greek word for
[33:16] that for that disputations all right so
[33:20] let's continue for one believeth that he
[33:22] may eat all things another who is weak
[33:24] eateth herbs
[33:29] late night but not him inside inside Joe
[33:34] you just asked brother wait like let not
[33:37] him that eateth despise him that eateth
[33:39] not right and let not him which eateth
[33:44] not judge him that eateth for God hath
[33:47] received him right so at that time you
[33:50] know there was people that so this meat
[33:53] was sacrifice unto idols and things like
[33:55] that and there was Christians who who
[33:59] didn't you know who were bothered you
[34:01] know especially those who were newly
[34:02] born Christians they men were bothered
[34:04] about eating certain types of meats like
[34:07] pork and things like that especially
[34:08] because these were Jews you know Jews
[34:10] don't don't mess with pork but Paul is
[34:15] trying to bring them amen and trying to
[34:17] bring them to a balance right because
[34:21] Saints sometimes you know for there's
[34:26] clear things in our life that we should
[34:28] not do right a Christian that Holy
[34:31] Spirit will teach you those things right
[34:33] there's clear things we know especially
[34:35] those just take smoking you know smoking
[34:38] cigarettes you know you're hurting your
[34:40] your your health for one they men and I
[34:43] just don't see the Jesus sitting around
[34:46] smoking cigarettes right you know what
[34:48] would Jesus do like darn banjo right
[34:51] right it's a demon all right but then
[34:54] there's things amen that you might find
[34:57] that it's okay for you and and I may
[35:01] find it highway just want I don't have
[35:02] the faith to do that or vice versa right
[35:05] right you might you to you might be bad
[35:09] but to me it might not be bad or vice
[35:10] versa and this is what Paul is trying to
[35:12] bring out he says who art thou that
[35:16] judgest another man's servant to his own
[35:19] master he standeth or falleth yea he
[35:21] shall be Holden for God is able to make
[35:22] him stand now one man esteemeth one day
[35:25] above another another steam ahthe every
[35:28] day alike let every man be fully
[35:30] persuaded in his own mind right let's
[35:34] just take Christmas for example some
[35:36] people celebrate Christmas right they
[35:40] they think you know it's okay
[35:42] that's fun you know some people don't
[35:44] want to celebrate Christmas don't want
[35:46] to put up a Christmas tree and things
[35:48] like that that's fine to you be
[35:51] persuaded in your own mind as what Paul
[35:53] says because that is not a Salvation
[35:55] issue that you don't find in that and
[35:59] sitting anywhere in the scripture where
[36:00] that's a Salvation issue all right but I
[36:03] should not condemn you and neither
[36:05] should you condemn me if I don't put up
[36:07] your Christmas tree or Christmas tree
[36:08] right amen he that regardeth the day
[36:11] regardeth it unto the Lord and He that
[36:15] regardeth not the day to the Lord he
[36:17] does not regard it the both of them are
[36:19] serving the Lord right is that what Paul
[36:23] saying he that eateth eateth to the Lord
[36:27] for he giveth God thanks and he that
[36:31] eateth not to the Lord he doth not and
[36:33] giveth God things
[36:35] so why judge one another right let God
[36:39] be the doulton a judge of all those
[36:41] things right because you know what all
[36:43] that brings is just doubtful
[36:44] disputations things that will not cause
[36:48] us to grow more in the Lord all right
[36:50] all right now let's just skip down keep
[36:54] it going let's see for whether we live
[36:56] or keep going down
[36:59] all right verse 10 but why does thou
[37:02] judge thy brother or why does thou say
[37:04] that not thy brother for we shall all
[37:06] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[37:08] keep going verse 12 so then so then
[37:13] every one of us shall give account of
[37:15] himself to God all right and you can
[37:17] read the scriptures on your own Amen
[37:19] that is the book of Romans is so good
[37:22] let us not therefore judge one another
[37:25] any more but Judge this rather that no
[37:33] man put a stumbling block or an occasion
[37:35] to fall in his brothers way
[37:39] so I look up the word stumbling-block
[37:41] and this is what it says an obstacle in
[37:43] the way which if one strikes his foot
[37:46] against he stumbles or Falls that over
[37:49] which a soul stumbles by which is caused
[37:52] to sin amen
[37:54] praise God so I've because when I first
[37:58] come into the message you know and I was
[38:00] around certain brothers they felt a
[38:01] Liberty to you know speak or say things
[38:05] or act a certain way that I didn't feel
[38:08] at liberty to do I didn't feel
[38:09] comfortable right but then sometimes you
[38:12] know and I felt like they were just
[38:13] being haughty about about it you know
[38:16] they have faith in to do that but I
[38:18] didn't have faith to do that go that way
[38:19] right but you let's let's just be
[38:22] careful for us not to be a stumbling
[38:24] block to one another right if I know
[38:26] that something is is offensive or is
[38:29] gonna cause a stumbling block to brother
[38:30] dick amen I just won't go there right
[38:33] right I gave an example of you know when
[38:36] I go when I go to overseas and there's a
[38:39] certain food that I might like they
[38:41] might be cooked in blood you know are
[38:44] there's a certain food that I lacked
[38:46] they do like it it's called blood
[38:48] sausage but you know what to a lot of
[38:52] Christians and it's it's a it's a it's a
[38:54] pig's gut that's stuffed with rice and
[38:57] meat and things like that and it's
[38:58] cooked in blood right it's really good I
[39:01] grew up eating that so but you know what
[39:13] st. if I'm a round of believers because
[39:16] there's lots of Christians that do won't
[39:17] eat that because of what the Bible says
[39:20] about blood right I will not eat it
[39:24] because of them especially if I am
[39:26] trying to win them for the Lord if I I
[39:28] want them to draw close to the Lord I
[39:30] will not do it I will I will I will not
[39:34] I will sacrifice my desire for this
[39:37] blood sausage in order to gain a soul
[39:40] right that's what Paul is talking about
[39:43] as I'm using the blood sausage as an
[39:45] example right praise God
[39:48] amen this is all part of the kingdom
[39:50] saying
[39:50] amen because let me tell you it's it's a
[39:54] it is external amen but but it's also
[39:57] internal as well they meant praise God
[40:00] now and look and look what Paul says
[40:04] here in Romans 14 14 I know em am
[40:08] persuaded by the Lord Jesus by the Lord
[40:12] Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
[40:14] itself let me tell you what Saints you
[40:21] know let's give the TV for example
[40:23] television within itself that box is not
[40:28] unclean right there's more harm in your
[40:32] cell phone then there isn't that TV and
[40:34] you carry that thing with you everywhere
[40:37] you're more harm in that but people are
[40:42] you can't have a TV you know but you
[40:44] know as you know between you and God but
[40:47] but you know there's more harming a
[40:49] computer in a cell phone the Internet
[40:52] has done more harm but you know what
[40:54] those things could be used for good and
[40:55] for bad
[40:56] right now we're streaming live we're
[40:59] using it for good right but at the same
[41:02] time it's being used for bad at this
[41:05] very moment that we're talking it's
[41:07] being used for bad so it's what depends
[41:09] on what you use it for something because
[41:10] Paul said I'm persuaded by the Lord
[41:13] Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
[41:14] itself nothing nothing unclean of it sir
[41:17] but to him that esteemeth anything to be
[41:20] unclean to him it is unclean so if you
[41:22] think something is bad it's bad to you
[41:25] but don't bring it as a doctrine and say
[41:28] you say the whole church shouldn't do it
[41:30] and come on here without just brings
[41:36] doubtful disputations I'm just bringing
[41:38] it down home Saints praise God verse 15
[41:44] but if thy brother be grieved with thy
[41:46] meat now walkest thou not charitably
[41:48] destroy not him with thy meat for whom
[41:50] Christ died alright let not then your
[41:55] good be evil spoken of alright
[41:57] well whatever you think is good for you
[41:59] that let it not be evil spoken us
[42:02] amen for the kingdom of God look in
[42:05] Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is
[42:07] not meat and drink but righteousness and
[42:09] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's
[42:14] that's true kingdom of God a praise guy
[42:17] so let's go to the back to the slideshow
[42:21] sorry I just had to come down a little
[42:23] bit home down down down to our level
[42:25] when so yeah brace guy they bring back
[42:30] the PowerPoint saying so I suggest
[42:33] Saints that brother and brother wait
[42:35] he's doing a series on the Romans right
[42:37] now downstairs and you know just look
[42:40] into the book of romans you reread that
[42:42] because paul brought such incredible
[42:45] balance in this script in the scriptures
[42:47] amen
[42:48] it was such a balanced person amen they
[42:51] would take all these all these things
[42:53] that we still you know you'd think
[42:55] people fifty years now that we've been
[42:57] in the message and all this legalism and
[42:59] all these things that people still

[43:46] brother Brown says you're God's God's
[43:49] blood bound promises makes us free from
[43:51] sin and shame and different from the
[43:54] rest of the world you don't have to
[43:57] dress different anybody can dress
[44:00] different you have to be on the inside
[44:03] different right
[44:06] where's God the life is on the inside
[44:09] not dressing wearing the kingdom of God
[44:13] is not meat and drink or wearing of
[44:15] apparel but it's the long-suffering
[44:17] goodness gentlest pages in the Holy
[44:19] Ghost so brother Branham agrees
[44:23] praise God NYX now look what brother
[44:27] bran says here we'll just start right
[44:29] here then we're going to come over on
[44:30] the Armenian side what did they get
[44:32] works

[44:39] short-sleeved shirt the man will and so
[44:42] forth like that that has nothing to do
[44:45] with the kingdom amen that has nothing
[44:49] to do with Kingdom no sir you can let
[44:51] your hair grow long you can wear dresses
[44:53] whatever you want to or you can do this
[44:55] that or the other and it won't have
[44:56] nothing at all to do with it
[44:58] if that kingdom of God is not inside of
[45:01] you first place God next slide
[45:06] hallelujah how many love the Lord praise
[45:09] God now look you can visit the same
[45:13] quote you're not saved because of your
[45:15] clothes and well you know when we first
[45:19] come into into the message you know and
[45:21] you know you think oh man I gotta
[45:24] straighten up I start wearing my Allah
[45:26] and we think the whole we're doing
[45:27] alright you know we're doing it right
[45:29] and then we like on prayer we like on
[45:31] reading the word we like on study but we
[45:33] were our long dresses and we wear you
[45:37] rather be baby studying and stuff like
[45:40] that you know that you're better off
[45:41] doing that if so God would just have
[45:46] made some patterns of such if it was if
[45:50] it was if we were saved by our clothes
[45:52] and then brother Dale he'd be in the
[45:54] back as you're leaving and passing out
[45:56] the patterns so that you can come to
[45:58] church the next address just like that
[46:01] because let me tell you sites there's
[46:04] churches that do that I've been in them
[46:08] you know and you the spirit is different
[46:15] there's like no liberty amen
[46:18] you're saved because that God saved you
[46:21] by grace and you do these things just in
[46:24] appreciation amen
[46:26] common decency will tell you that you do
[46:29] those things in appreciation thanks God
[46:31] next slide alright so let's talk about
[46:36] and not far from the kingdom amen and
[46:39] now I was reading this today and I got
[46:40] the Lord showed me something here that
[46:43] it was was good well let's read mark
[46:46] chapter 12 this is uh Jesus says I'm one
[46:51] of the scribes came and haven't heard
[46:53] them reasoning together and perceiving
[46:54] that he had answered them well asked him
[46:56] which is the first commandment of all
[46:58] and jesus answered him said the first of
[47:03] all the commandments is hear o Israel
[47:05] the Lord our God is one Lord now that is
[47:08] not the commandment in Exodus chapter 20
[47:11] this is Deuteronomy chapter 6 alright
[47:14] because when you first look at this and
[47:16] you read it and you reread fast which we
[47:19] shouldn't we should read take our time
[47:21] reading the word amen and we think oh
[47:24] that's Ten Commandments right but God
[47:26] gave Israel all kinds of Commandments
[47:29] right and they're all scattered in
[47:31] different parts of Leviticus Deuteronomy
[47:32] and all in numbers and things and in
[47:36] verse in verse 30 and thou shalt love
[47:38] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[47:41] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[47:43] and with all thy strength this is the
[47:45] first commandment
[47:46] you'll find this in Deuteronomy
[47:47] Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 4 that's
[47:50] where you'll find that NIC next slide
[47:52] and look what Jesus says the second
[47:55] commandment is and the second is like
[47:58] because the the the scribe was asking
[48:01] him what is the first and the best of
[48:03] the most important commandment but
[48:05] remember when Jesus said if somebody
[48:06] asks you or somebody wants your your
[48:09] tunic you know give them your another
[48:12] part of his clothes and getting the
[48:13] whole thing Jesus always gives it a
[48:15] little extra yeah as you can see because
[48:19] he only asked for the first one just one
[48:21] commandment but Jesus gives them to
[48:22] another one he says and the second is
[48:24] like namely this thou shalt love thy
[48:26] neighbour as
[48:28] there is none other commandment greater
[48:30] than these and then you'll read that in
[48:34] in Leviticus I have it written down
[48:36] right here Leviticus Leviticus chapter
[48:39] 19 verse 18 if you read that scripture
[48:42] this is what it says thou shalt not
[48:44] avenge nor bear any grudge against the
[48:46] children of thy people amen but thou
[48:49] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am
[48:53] the Lord amen
[48:54] so so so and so let's continue reading
[48:59] and the scribe said unto him well master
[49:02] - said the truth for there is one God
[49:04] and there is none other but he so he
[49:06] agreed with what Jesus was talking about
[49:07] right and to love him with all the heart
[49:11] and with all the understanding with all
[49:12] the soul and with all the strength and
[49:14] to love his neighbor as himself is more
[49:15] than all hole burnt offerings and
[49:18] sacrifices in other words that's those
[49:21] two commandments are more important than
[49:23] any of the other things that God had
[49:25] already given the you know God would
[49:29] prefer that he do they do this instead
[49:31] of the sacrifices and all these things
[49:33] right and so and so and when Jesus saw
[49:38] that he answered discreetly in other
[49:40] words wisely he said unto Him thou art
[49:42] not far from the kingdom of God but was
[49:47] he in the kingdom of God that didn't put
[49:49] him in the kingdom of God right no he
[49:54] said they are not far from the kingdom
[49:55] of God so you can agree with the word he
[49:59] agreed with Jesus himself but that has
[50:01] nothing to do with a new birth
[50:03] that doesn't mean you're born again that
[50:06] doesn't mean because let me tell I
[50:07] wondered this scrubb we don't have any
[50:09] record that this scribe was in the upper
[50:10] room I don't know maybe he was maybe it
[50:12] was and I don't know I don't think so
[50:14] or them he maybe later on received the
[50:17] Lord I don't know more than likely he
[50:19] did it but I don't know but you see he
[50:22] but Jesus said you're not far from the
[50:24] kingdom you said you're not in the
[50:26] kingdom
[50:27] just because you agreed with me you can
[50:29] agree with Jesus you can agree with the
[50:31] pastor you can agree with with the with
[50:33] the minister all you but that has
[50:34] nothing to do with you being in the
[50:36] kingdom of God you need an experience
[50:38] with God
[50:39] amen so young people you come to church
[50:42] you could be here every single day of
[50:45] your life every Sunday not miss a
[50:47] service that has nothing to do with you
[50:49] having the kingdom of God inside of you
[50:51] how do you treat your mom and dad do you
[50:54] obey your parents because the Bible says
[50:56] so do you respect your parents I'm
[51:01] talking out to the young people or do we
[51:04] respect one another and then sometimes
[51:07] we lack respect for one another we treat
[51:10] each other so so loosely I mean somebody
[51:14] gets offended and then you know next
[51:27] that's that goes for me too
[51:30] next slide alright and this is a this is
[51:35] a brother branham was he he was in a
[51:38] nurse's office and the lady asked
[51:41] brother brandon says what denomination
[51:43] of church do you belong to you can read
[51:45] the whole thing if you want get a copy
[51:46] and I said oh I belong to the oldest
[51:48] denomination that there is and she said
[51:51] what denomination is that I said it's
[51:53] the one that was organized before the
[51:54] world ever was organized
[51:55] oh she said what I don't believe I know
[51:58] just that she said I belong to a certain
[52:00] church is that is that is it that
[52:02] organization next slide I said no ma'am
[52:07] that was only about two hundred years
[52:08] ago that organization but this
[52:11] organization started when the morning
[52:12] stars sang together and the sons of God
[52:14] shouted for joy when they seen the
[52:16] coming of a savior to redeem mankind and
[52:18] she just stopped rubbing my back and I
[52:20] was stooped a little over this way so
[52:21] the lady could rub and she was from near
[52:24] accordian down here and when we got to
[52:26] talking and she said sir I've always
[52:28] believed that if God ever was God he's
[52:30] still God today
[52:31] just like he was in the old days she
[52:34] said though my church flatly denies that
[52:37] but I believe that it is the truth she's
[52:40] agreeing with what brother Brandon was
[52:41] telling her right and Berggren says and
[52:44] I said you're not far from the kingdom
[52:46] of God John all right she said if he
[52:49] ever was a healer isn't he still here I
[52:51] said he most certainly is my
[52:52] amen praise God next but that didn't put
[52:55] her in the kingdom she wasn't in the
[52:57] king already that didn't put her in the
[52:59] king that's a novel read this one then
[53:02] we'll move on the day after our meeting
[53:04] in Phoenix there's a little lady came up
[53:05] and said brother brown since the
[53:06] meetings said I let my hair grow I said
[53:09] you're not far from the kingdom now but
[53:12] that didn't save her she said my sister
[53:16] had a wheelbarrow full of these shorts
[53:17] and things she was going to throw them
[53:18] in the garbage can and the next sister
[53:20] come along and got them and said she was
[53:23] finished with those things so I said
[53:24] that's alright I believe the church will
[53:26] come back on its feet someday if it
[53:27] keeps going on like that it'll get
[53:29] alright alright next next next alright
[53:37] next next these are other just examples
[53:43] of when brought their brother Baron told
[53:44] somebody you're not far from the king
[53:46] right so I'm bringing it down you know
[53:48] first seek you first the kingdom all
[53:51] right
[53:51] that's why I put that there first second
[53:54] you can be close to the kingdom but not
[53:56] in the kingdom you can be so close to
[53:59] the word but not have the word in you
[54:01] write the word has to go through a new
[54:04] birth right now so how do you enter into
[54:08] this kingdom hey man as we've read this
[54:11] many times well let's let's pay close
[54:13] attention to it there was a man of the
[54:14] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[54:16] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[54:19] said unto him rabbi we know that thou
[54:22] art a teacher come from God for no man
[54:25] can do these miracles that thou dost
[54:26] except God be with him right so they
[54:29] recognized that they need that jesus
[54:32] answered and said unto Him verily verily
[54:34] I say unto you in other words this is
[54:36] very important that you hear this
[54:38] Nicodemus except a man be born again he
[54:42] cannot see the kingdom of God now we
[54:45] know that the kingdom of seeing is
[54:48] understanding the kingdom of God he
[54:50] cannot even understand the kingdom of
[54:51] God if you're not born again alright
[54:54] next Nicodemus saith unto Him how can a
[54:58] man be born when he is old can he enter
[55:01] the second time into his mother's
[55:03] and be born what a carnal question but
[55:06] that's as far as Nicodemus knew at the
[55:08] time right jesus answered verily verily
[55:11] I say unto thee except a man be born of
[55:14] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[55:17] into the kingdom of God wherever you see
[55:19] water you always see the spirit amen
[55:22] they go hand in hand that which is born
[55:25] of the flesh is flesh and that which is
[55:27] born of the Spirit is spirit
[55:29] a man so if you're born of God your will
[55:32] be godly you're right amen you're God
[55:34] hey man if you're born of the flesh
[55:36] you're just the devil you're doing the
[55:39] things of the devil right Ray's guy
[55:42] Marvel not that I said unto thee you
[55:44] must be born again in other words don't
[55:45] be surprised that I'm telling you this
[55:47] now watch this because sometimes we read
[55:50] the scripture down here and we don't I
[55:51] don't never really paid attention but
[55:53] God showed me something here the wind
[55:56] bloweth where it listeth in other words
[55:58] when you see the wind blowing it goes
[56:00] wherever you want it right you can't
[56:01] control it right and now here's the
[56:04] sound thereof you can hear the wind
[56:06] blowing but Ken's not tell whence it
[56:09] cometh sometimes you can't tell where
[56:11] the wind comes from and whither it goes
[56:14] right so is every one that is born of
[56:18] the Spirit right I think about that
[56:21] sense because Saints to me to me this
[56:25] ties in directly with with the Bible
[56:28] where it says in Hebrews amen faith is
[56:30] the substance of things hoped for the
[56:33] evidence of things not seen
[56:36] right we're born again of faith right
[56:40] where the bram said that we're born
[56:43] again at faith but sometimes Saints you
[56:46] you can sometimes you cannot explain
[56:48] your new birth week in holic we can't
[56:51] explain what it is you know God has been
[56:53] working with us different ways and it's
[56:55] sometime something that's because Jesus
[56:57] even says is the wind blows were
[56:58] enlisted and then you cannot tell where
[57:00] it cometh where it go with him and so is
[57:02] every one that is born of the Spirit
[57:03] it's something that you cannot see
[57:06] something that you cannot hear amen but
[57:09] you know it's there because you see the
[57:11] effects of right that's the important
[57:14] eye that's the important part
[57:15] amen praise God you see the
[57:17] manifestations of that praise guy let's
[57:20] go to the next slide in Ephesians
[57:23] chapter 5 verse 26 oh let's get this
[57:28] done
[57:30] alright yeah than that next next next
[57:37] next next alright so how do you enter
[57:45] into this kingdom better yet how does
[57:47] this Kingdom enter into you right
[57:51] because that's what it's all about
[57:53] having the kingdom in us right but jesus
[57:57] said you know if my word about and you
[57:59] in you and I if I bought in you and you
[58:01] abide in me when you have the kingdom
[58:03] inside of you you automatically abiding
[58:05] in him amen praise God there is only one
[58:09] way brother Branham said in 1963 you are
[58:11] born into the kingdom of God how by the
[58:13] Holy Ghost
[58:15] that's God's witness he gives witness by
[58:19] the Word of God that we've passed from
[58:21] death unto life because we are in the
[58:23] kingdom of God amen you're born by the
[58:26] word amen no matter what it looks like
[58:31] here but better than in 1950
[58:33] Oh God he says here jesus said except a
[58:36] man be born of water and spirit he
[58:40] cannot see the kingdom of God in other
[58:41] words he can't understand the kingdom of
[58:43] God until he's born again see you you
[58:47] have to accept it by faith you born
[58:50] again have faith right praise God you
[58:52] have to accept of it and when and then
[58:54] when he comes into you you understand it
[58:58] hey man that was 1950 praise God next
[59:04] slide that's why the scripture says
[59:08] Saints that the natural man does not
[59:10] understand that things of God because to
[59:13] him is craziness
[59:14] right yeah to him is you know I don't
[59:18] understand but if he gets the new birth
[59:21] amen
[59:22] and you're born by the water in the
[59:24] spirit which is the word right and Jesus
[59:26] said my words are spirit and life right
[59:29] if you're born by those things
[59:31] by that word if you're born again by
[59:33] that word you're going to understand
[59:35] more of the word you see how simple God
[59:37] is that's simple but we just make it so
[59:41] complicated and we try to make people do
[59:44] all kinds of things to be born again and
[59:46] get saved and all I had to do is get a
[59:49] revelation in that word it's your
[59:52] personal revelation amen
[59:54] oh Christ this to you and that's what
[59:57] brother Branham said amen question and
[1:00:00] answers 1959 brother man says verily
[1:00:03] verily I say unto you except a man be
[1:00:05] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:00:07] God now you couldn't see the kingdom of
[1:00:09] God because the kingdom of God is the
[1:00:11] Holy Spirit you see what Jesus said you
[1:00:13] can see the wind bloweth and you'll go
[1:00:16] it listed but you cannot tell so is them
[1:00:18] that are born of the Spirit jesus said
[1:00:21] that see because the kingdom of God is
[1:00:23] the Holy Spirit you can't see that
[1:00:24] kingdom some standing here will not
[1:00:26] taste the debt till they see the kingdom
[1:00:28] coming in power he said then the kingdom
[1:00:30] of God the Bible said is within you it's
[1:00:33] within you the Holy Spirit and you can't
[1:00:35] see that with your eyes so see means to
[1:00:38] understand amen
[1:00:40] I mean you're still with me I appreciate
[1:00:43] your patience I appreciate you listening
[1:00:45] next amen all right now you remember
[1:00:52] when we read in Luke chapter 17 when
[1:00:54] Jesus said were it again and when he was
[1:00:55] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[1:00:57] kingdom of God should come he answered
[1:00:59] them and said the kingdom of God cometh
[1:01:01] not with observation in other words it's
[1:01:04] something that cannot be seen nobody's
[1:01:06] gonna say there's the kingdom of God
[1:01:08] there's the kingdom of God usually
[1:01:10] that's what's that's the false thing
[1:01:12] [Laughter]
[1:01:13] because got something that's not how God
[1:01:16] works
[1:01:17] you know what Saints that cloud appeared
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:23] only a little small portion here on
[1:01:25] earth knows that that cloud appeared on
[1:01:27] Jesus just a very my Newt but it was it
[1:01:32] was there was big but only on my new
[1:01:36] people my new portion of people know
[1:01:39] what that's all about
[1:01:40] aren't you thankful that you want
[1:01:43] God and God didn't send no fireworks
[1:01:46] with it or anything like that nothing
[1:01:48] explosive nothing a met it was so simple
[1:01:50] and so Amen that's how God does you know
[1:01:54] brother Branham said that Jesus was on
[1:01:56] earth and and only three quarters or
[1:01:59] more of the whole earth didn't even know
[1:02:01] that Messiah was on earth that's how God
[1:02:04] does things neither saw they say lo here
[1:02:07] or lo there for behold the kingdom of
[1:02:09] God is within them
[1:02:10] right and to think that the kingdom of
[1:02:12] God is working in a people right now in
[1:02:14] a multi-member broad Amen the bride of
[1:02:16] Jesus Christ and and and and people
[1:02:21] shooting birds at you and then and
[1:02:24] cursing you out and things like that if
[1:02:26] they just knew what they went lies
[1:02:28] within you they probably wouldn't do
[1:02:31] that I had a situation there in Canada
[1:02:34] when I was there in Canada where
[1:02:36] unfortunately I got upset God was
[1:02:39] driving in a median took over mm I got
[1:02:44] in the median to take over me
[1:02:46] is uh no not another interstate on a
[1:02:48] highway took over me and took over the
[1:02:51] car in front of me and I got up to the
[1:02:54] red light the next red light and I said
[1:02:56] hey buddy what's the rush and then I red
[1:02:59] light turned green and I just kept going
[1:03:00] no I shouldn't have done that because
[1:03:02] because my daughters were with me
[1:03:05] Christine was not with me at the moment
[1:03:06] so he got off the left turning less lane
[1:03:09] and he went to following me I said oh my
[1:03:13] and I was almost at my sister-in-law's
[1:03:16] house that at the next red light I was
[1:03:18] gonna turn left I said I better not
[1:03:20] because that's her subdivision so I
[1:03:22] better not she'll know he'll know where
[1:03:23] she lives
[1:03:24] and I don't want to do that so I just
[1:03:26] kept going or at that red light he got
[1:03:28] onto the on the right lane and he said
[1:03:31] what does it matter to you he started
[1:03:34] fussing at me and started screaming and
[1:03:35] I said listen listen listen bud I was
[1:03:39] trying to be as nice as I could listen
[1:03:41] but I got kids in the car I said you
[1:03:43] could have put them in danger and as I
[1:03:45] was saying that I saw in the backseat he
[1:03:47] had his wife with him on that next door
[1:03:49] his wife or his girlfriend driving a
[1:03:51] nice car he had and the backseat a
[1:03:53] little baby it can't be no more than two
[1:03:56] months old
[1:03:57] and driving like that I said looking you
[1:03:59] got a kid in the back and he said what
[1:04:02] does that matter to you I don't care it
[1:04:03] doesn't matter you know I just said
[1:04:05] learn I just closed my window back up
[1:04:06] and kept driving finally he got he got
[1:04:09] tired of following me and got in front
[1:04:11] of me and as they were passing me they
[1:04:13] they shot me the finger
[1:04:16] yeah number one I said I'm number they
[1:04:21] told me that was number one but you know
[1:04:25] what Saints if the world would just know
[1:04:27] who they were you know what lies within
[1:04:29] you and me they wouldn't do the things
[1:04:31] that they do
[1:04:32] I told Bella Bella was way bellows
[1:04:33] scared you know obviously and she I said
[1:04:36] I said Bella you see how the world is
[1:04:37] when they don't know God anyways so the
[1:04:44] kingdom of God is a mystery right Jesus
[1:04:48] declared that it was right look what it
[1:04:51] says here and he said unto them unto you
[1:04:52] it is given to know the mystery of the
[1:04:55] kingdom of God it's a mystery
[1:04:58] they say he was talking to his disciples
[1:05:00] right now this is before they got the
[1:05:03] upper room experience the new birth hey
[1:05:05] weren't lady had the new birth but he
[1:05:07] said unto you is given to know the
[1:05:09] mystery of the kingdom of God but unto
[1:05:11] them there are without all these things
[1:05:13] are done in parables in other words the
[1:05:15] day it's like Pilate they're they're
[1:05:17] listening but they don't listen they
[1:05:19] hear but they don't hear right Luke 8:10
[1:05:23] until you it is given to know the
[1:05:25] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[1:05:27] others in parables that scene they may
[1:05:30] not see in here and they might not
[1:05:32] understand so so next slide Saints this
[1:05:36] is something that's done in secret it's
[1:05:39] a thing between you and God
[1:05:40] it's not anything as a public show or
[1:05:43] anything like that the kingdom of God is
[1:05:46] a mystery now reveals to it where cost
[1:05:49] is one well if I am made a minister
[1:05:51] according to the dispensation of God
[1:05:53] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:05:55] the Word of God this is Paul speaking
[1:05:56] even the mystery which have been hid
[1:05:59] from ages and from generations but now
[1:06:03] is made manifest to his
[1:06:05] now has made manifest to his Saints
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:09] it's a mystery to the world but now it's
[1:06:12] made manifest to his Saints praise God
[1:06:14] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:06:18] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:06:20] among the gentiles which is christ in
[1:06:24] you the hope of glory amen fact that God
[1:06:30] working in us amen
[1:06:33] dwelling in us live in his life through
[1:06:36] us doing miracles through us amen that's
[1:06:38] a mystery to the world but it's revealed
[1:06:41] manifest to his Saints amen
[1:06:43] next and then in Hebrews chapter 11 now
[1:06:49] faith is the so it's difficult to
[1:06:51] explain a new birth yet you know it's
[1:06:53] taking place right some of us can
[1:06:56] pinpoint you know some of us comprar but
[1:06:59] you know but we know that God is doing
[1:07:01] or has worked in our life I believe God
[1:07:05] you know did a work in my life amen
[1:07:07] because you know what this work that
[1:07:09] he's doing is drawing me closer to his
[1:07:10] word amen and if something is drawing
[1:07:14] you away from his word then it's not a
[1:07:15] new birth it wasn't a word birth amen
[1:07:19] Hebrews 11 says now faith is the
[1:07:22] substance substance you know like when
[1:07:26] you're when you're drinking a soup you
[1:07:27] know and with some substance some but
[1:07:30] sometimes you you you wanna a thick soup
[1:07:33] you know not something so water you want
[1:07:35] something thick with vegetables in it
[1:07:38] and stuff like that you know something
[1:07:40] there's something real right and you
[1:07:43] think faith is not I can't see faith but
[1:07:46] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:07:48] for amen the faith the evidence of
[1:07:52] things not seen
[1:07:53] amen the faith in the word Amen that's
[1:07:59] birthing you from day to day amen for it
[1:08:03] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:08:04] report through faith we understand that
[1:08:06] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[1:08:08] God so that things which are seen were
[1:08:11] not made of things which do appear now I
[1:08:17] put quanta there and if you
[1:08:19] a couple of months ago I preached a
[1:08:21] message called when God saw the light
[1:08:23] and in that message I explained about
[1:08:25] quantum mechanics and what quanta is but
[1:08:29] pretty much what quanta is is for
[1:08:31] example you take this pulpit this pulpit
[1:08:34] is made of molecules right they can see
[1:08:37] molecules through the microscope and
[1:08:39] then and then as it molecules and then
[1:08:43] atoms makes up molecules right and then
[1:08:47] but but after atoms is what's called
[1:08:51] quanta now they know it's there but they
[1:08:55] can't explain see it right that's the
[1:08:59] reason why the Bible says here says with
[1:09:01] so that things which are seen were not
[1:09:04] not made of things which do appear the
[1:09:08] things that you see amen the work that
[1:09:10] you and bringing down spiritual the work
[1:09:12] that you see that God is doing anything
[1:09:14] is made of things amen it's taken it's
[1:09:17] taking up of made up of things that the
[1:09:20] world cannot see you can't even fully
[1:09:22] understand but yet God is a man making
[1:09:25] it manifest to you hey man how in the
[1:09:28] world is that God is gonna he was
[1:09:30] walking with us and then yet God is
[1:09:32] dwelling in us amen right so so that's
[1:09:37] what quanta is you know and but yet you
[1:09:40] know what quanta holds all these things
[1:09:42] together what holds the quanta the
[1:09:45] molecules and the atoms together is
[1:09:46] light remember in Genesis chapter one
[1:09:50] when the Bible says and God God made
[1:09:55] heavens and earth what is it
[1:09:58] and God said there let there be light
[1:10:00] right that was not the Sun in the moon
[1:10:04] because God is light right because later
[1:10:07] on we see later in that chapter that the
[1:10:09] Sun the Moon and stars came all right so
[1:10:12] all these things are held by God your
[1:10:15] new birth is held by God amen praise God
[1:10:18] yet you don't see it the world doesn't
[1:10:21] see it they don't understand that they
[1:10:23] think you're foolish they'll shoot birds
[1:10:24] at you and all kinds of stains but yeah
[1:10:26] a man you're held by his life a man his
[1:10:30] word
[1:10:31] praise God praise God I hope you
[1:10:33] understand what I'm trying to get to in
[1:10:37] James chapter 2 verse 5 hearken my below
[1:10:39] brethren hath not God chosen the poor of
[1:10:41] this world rich in faith and heirs of
[1:10:47] the kingdom so you say I'm weak in faith
[1:10:51] God calls you rich in faith I'm just
[1:10:55] gonna stay with what the word says
[1:10:57] you know why was he watching me like
[1:11:00] brother whether jewel says I can't make
[1:11:03] it I have such low faith but the Bible
[1:11:06] says you're rich in faith a man rich in
[1:11:10] faith and heirs of the kingdom are you
[1:11:12] aired of the kingdom the new birth in a
[1:11:15] man your era of the camera a man new
[1:11:17] birth in your soul which he had promised
[1:11:19] to them that love him and then next
[1:11:22] praise God we're almost done here Saints
[1:11:26] next slide
[1:11:28] know where the brown says here 1960 the
[1:11:34] kingdom of God's within you so you
[1:11:36] couldn't actually see it lest you see it
[1:11:39] operating but the only way you'll ever
[1:11:42] be able to understand it you've got to
[1:11:45] be born again to be born again you've
[1:11:50] been filled with God's Spirit then
[1:11:52] you're in Christ and when you're in
[1:11:55] Christ the Holy Spirit that wrote the
[1:11:58] Bible that manifested Christ is in you
[1:12:01] to recognize his own self I like ya amen
[1:12:07] he recognizes a that's an attribute of
[1:12:10] mind he or she belongs to me
[1:12:13] hey man praise God amen so the kingdom
[1:12:17] of God is made up of attributes that
[1:12:19] cannot be seen or understood by the
[1:12:20] natural man amen praise God next slide
[1:12:25] 1959 question answers the question looks
[1:12:28] at things that he doesn't see with his
[1:12:30] eyes for we look at the unseen see how
[1:12:34] do you look at it with your inside eyes
[1:12:36] you see it by faith see and now to prove
[1:12:42] that the whole Christian armor is
[1:12:44] of unseen qualities right what is a
[1:12:48] Christian armor somebody says seeing is
[1:12:50] believing that person would never be a
[1:12:52] Christian because the armor of the
[1:12:56] Christian is made up of this love did
[1:12:59] you ever see it could you go to the
[1:13:02] store and say I want a pound of love two
[1:13:06] pounds of love no they can't give you
[1:13:09] that the world can't produce that you
[1:13:11] can you've never seen it but you know
[1:13:12] it's there right did you ever see it
[1:13:15] you've seen it in action but you never
[1:13:18] seen love if you can pull your part of
[1:13:22] love out and let me see what it looks
[1:13:24] like see look love joy peace
[1:13:26] longsuffering goodness meekness faith
[1:13:28] gentlest see the whole Christian armor
[1:13:31] is unseen with the natural eye that's
[1:13:36] why the world can't see it but it's
[1:13:39] understood by the heart there you are
[1:13:43] there you are amen so it's unseen but
[1:13:49] it's working in you right now you can't
[1:13:52] see it you can't eemarle probably even
[1:13:54] explain it fully but you know it's there
[1:13:57] amen
[1:13:59] now the kingdom of God is not in word
[1:14:01] but in power but I will come to you in
[1:14:05] 1st Corinthians 4 I will come to you
[1:14:07] shortly the Lord will and will know not
[1:14:08] the speech of them which are puffed up
[1:14:10] but the power for the kingdom of God is
[1:14:12] not in word but in power amen that's the
[1:14:17] reason why the letter and word quote so
[1:14:19] the message could kill you if that power
[1:14:20] is not there to guide you to put these
[1:14:22] things together Thanks you could read
[1:14:25] the word you could read the message and
[1:14:28] you could put quotes and quotes together
[1:14:31] and have your own thing and it kill you
[1:14:35] if it's not led by revelation of the
[1:14:38] Holy Spirit brother Branham knew what he
[1:14:41] was talking about but yet they've come
[1:14:44] out with polygamy being the seventh the
[1:14:46] the the Seventh Seal he knew what he was
[1:14:52] talking about anyway but that's what
[1:14:56] that's why the letter will
[1:14:58] but if you get in that spirit that
[1:15:00] spirits already in you a man it will
[1:15:02] give it'll bring life to those things
[1:15:04] Saints amen so it needs to be in power
[1:15:07] amen that power that kingdom a man that
[1:15:11] power of the Holy Spirit right what is
[1:15:13] this power acts 1:8 but ye shall receive
[1:15:16] power and that's the word Dunamis in the
[1:15:19] Greek right which which means a war are
[1:15:23] changing of the soul working in sin the
[1:15:25] soul right after that the Holy Ghost is
[1:15:28] come upon you this is what Jesus was
[1:15:30] telling you this is hypose and ye shall
[1:15:32] be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[1:15:34] and all Judea and Samaria and unto the
[1:15:35] uttermost part of the earth but they
[1:15:38] already had power the God had given them
[1:15:42] power Jesus had given them power in
[1:15:44] Matthew chapter 10 but that's only on
[1:15:47] the externals that's why I'm saying
[1:15:50] sayings you can you can you know people
[1:15:54] can cast out devils heal the sick and
[1:15:55] all these different things those things
[1:15:57] can take place and still the person not
[1:15:59] being born again because they happened
[1:16:01] to the disciples and Judas was there and
[1:16:04] Jesus said that and I know I've chosen
[1:16:07] one of you I've chosen all of you and
[1:16:09] one of you is not just doesn't have a
[1:16:11] devil but is a devil Judas standing
[1:16:15] right there amongst him he was able to
[1:16:16] do all those things but that's XOC a
[1:16:20] power if you look at the word that's EXO
[1:16:22] sia
[1:16:23] which means a man which is external a
[1:16:25] man next but I tell you of a truth there
[1:16:30] be some standing here which shall not
[1:16:32] taste of death till they see the kingdom
[1:16:34] of God and that's talking to the
[1:16:36] disciples that power a man yeah he
[1:16:40] called it the kingdom of God and then
[1:16:41] another verse that we read earlier he
[1:16:43] called it the Holy Ghost amen now listen
[1:16:48] closely I'm trying to finish up what is
[1:16:52] the kingdom of God is within you the
[1:16:54] kingdom is the kingdom's in you and when
[1:16:56] the word comes in there what does this
[1:16:58] word begin it turns itself into power
[1:17:00] making it say just exactly what it says
[1:17:02] amen
[1:17:03] you stay with that word there it is see
[1:17:06] and it makes it power Jesus Christ the
[1:17:08] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:17:10] next now God's kingdom is not of this
[1:17:16] world and when Christ was here he give
[1:17:18] us the program of this kingdom he gave
[1:17:20] us the program of God's kingdom of the
[1:17:22] father's kingdom which is his word all
[1:17:25] right now if you want to know how you
[1:17:27] get into that kingdom this words got it
[1:17:29] that's what we need a word of word birth
[1:17:33] the kingdom was set up on the day of
[1:17:36] Pentecost and when man wanted to know
[1:17:40] how to get into this kingdom Peter said
[1:17:41] repair every one of you and be baptized
[1:17:43] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:17:44] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:17:45] receive the gift of that kingdom
[1:17:47] well that's Kingdom the Holy Ghost
[1:17:49] because that's what puts them into the
[1:17:52] kingdom a man next all right now this is
[1:17:57] Genesis 1:26 see God is trying to bring
[1:18:00] this back to that recognize that that
[1:18:03] that was the condition that Adam was in
[1:18:05] it was perfect amen
[1:18:08] now we know that he died so his flesh
[1:18:11] was not was not redeemed a man was not a
[1:18:14] man who died right but he's still he had
[1:18:17] eternal life amen
[1:18:19] he had eternal life and God said let us
[1:18:23] make man in our image after our likeness
[1:18:24] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:18:27] of the sea or the fowl of the air and
[1:18:29] you see the creation is groaning and
[1:18:32] travailing for the manifestation of the
[1:18:34] sons of God
[1:18:35] and you know last night I was reading
[1:18:36] with the kids and my wife in psalms
[1:18:39] chapter 8 where David is talking about
[1:18:41] what is man that he that he's God's
[1:18:44] given dominion to to have rule over the
[1:18:47] fish of the sea and over what is it that
[1:18:49] he he he made him a little lower than
[1:18:51] the angels and all this thing and I'm
[1:18:53] thinking you know what David's talking
[1:18:55] about that and he's talking about about
[1:18:58] how Adam was because I mean at that
[1:19:01] point you know Adam David didn't have
[1:19:05] control over the fish of the sea I don't
[1:19:06] have any control efficiency unless you
[1:19:09] you fish them out but I can't tell the
[1:19:11] fish to go here to go there to have full
[1:19:14] power I can't tell a bird to go here I
[1:19:16] want you to stay on my shoulder and
[1:19:18] don't fly away you can't do that unless
[1:19:21] you you know you can't rein certain
[1:19:23] birds to do that but
[1:19:24] a bird out here you couldn't do it but
[1:19:26] Adam had that power right I believe that
[1:19:29] a man in the Smyrna Church age unless we
[1:19:34] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[1:19:36] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[1:19:39] for this is that character simply is
[1:19:42] never made without suffering character
[1:19:45] is a victory not a gift a man without
[1:19:50] character can train because power
[1:19:53] apart from character is satanic right
[1:19:56] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:20:00] amen and since he wants us to share even
[1:20:03] his throne on the same basis that he
[1:20:05] overcame and is set down and his
[1:20:07] Father's throne then we have to overcome
[1:20:09] to sit with him as a reason in
[1:20:11] Revelations that he that overcometh
[1:20:13] shall he that overcometh this he ever
[1:20:15] overcometh that amen
[1:20:17] and even in China a later on in
[1:20:20] Revelation there's even like an eighth
[1:20:22] overcoming where he's given all things
[1:20:26] amen praise God
[1:20:29] so Saints that's the reason why this
[1:20:32] kingdom of God needs to be in you first
[1:20:35] because God ultimately wants us to have
[1:20:37] the mean just like Adam had dominion
[1:20:39] over the externals but because you know
[1:20:43] he was it was God right he was an
[1:20:48] amateur God right here on earth amen
[1:20:52] and that's the same thing that God wants
[1:20:54] to do with us amen we have dominion over
[1:20:57] our kingdom first
[1:20:58] this kingdom amen then God can give us a
[1:21:02] man he we are fit to rule a man the
[1:21:06] external Kingdom later right praise God
[1:21:09] in other words get the new birth in your
[1:21:12] life if you don't have that we'll take
[1:21:14] care of all these other things amen
[1:21:17] praise God next that's why these virtues
[1:21:22] need to be established in the believers
[1:21:24] life after that kingdom has come in the
[1:21:27] valley amen I love this picture amen
[1:21:31] because it's got building his kingdom
[1:21:33] right this is the statue of a perfect
[1:21:36] man with
[1:21:37] this represents a men ee the the
[1:21:39] believers life as well as well they men
[1:21:41] but you know what Peter talked about
[1:21:45] having these things in our life amen
[1:21:47] but that's not to save us statue a
[1:21:50] perfect man is not to save us it's after
[1:21:53] you're saved after you're born again
[1:21:55] then you add to your faith
[1:21:57] amen virtue and knowledge and temperance
[1:22:00] and patience add to your faith amen
[1:22:03] that's what Peter said so Peter must
[1:22:06] have known a man he knew that this had
[1:22:11] happened this was happening in his life
[1:22:12] a manner that he needed to talk about it
[1:22:16] so if it's in the word I believe it's
[1:22:18] important whoever said you don't need
[1:22:20] these virtues is lying to you because
[1:22:23] the Word of God talked about it and
[1:22:25] brother Brendan preached the whole
[1:22:26] service about it for you to say I don't
[1:22:29] need that my goodness cuz cuz Saints
[1:22:34] amen he is the head of it all right man
[1:22:38] he's the head of it all they mana and
[1:22:40] and and and and so that's what we're
[1:22:42] trying to reach st. st. but I believe
[1:22:45] that the amen you have everything in you
[1:22:47] already potential we just needed for it
[1:22:50] to manifest on the outside amen
[1:22:52] praise God next alright we're almost
[1:22:56] done we just got like two or three more
[1:22:57] slides and then we'll be done now if you
[1:23:00] read Daniel chapter 2 you notice there
[1:23:02] that God that this the Nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:07] had a dream right and this statue was
[1:23:10] built a man and then you see the gold
[1:23:13] the gold head which represents all these
[1:23:15] different empires and then even the
[1:23:17] bottom I own in the clay modern powers
[1:23:19] book brother BAM called it Romanism and
[1:23:21] Christianity a man at the end and you
[1:23:24] notice you see how that's Satan's
[1:23:27] Kingdom right Satan's Kingdom has no
[1:23:32] foundation Satan's Kingdom was built
[1:23:35] this way but God's kingdom was built
[1:23:38] from the feet up that's the reason why
[1:23:43] this kingdom amen when that rock came
[1:23:45] down if you read in Daniel chapter 2
[1:23:47] when that rock came down amen from the
[1:23:49] mountain amen
[1:23:51] it struck the feet of the statue a man
[1:23:55] and it crumbled in pieces because it had
[1:23:58] no foundation no sure foundation it
[1:24:00] fakes it has a foundation but it's
[1:24:02] nothing sure
[1:24:03] hey you man now if our foundation is the
[1:24:07] Word of God and then next so Satan
[1:24:13] builds his kingdom with no sure
[1:24:15] foundation the head down to the feet
[1:24:16] that's why it falls apart Christ builds
[1:24:18] his kingdom from the feet to the head
[1:24:20] amen praise God next Daniel chapter 2
[1:24:26] verse 35 then was the iron the clay the
[1:24:28] brass the silver and the gold broke into
[1:24:30] pieces together and became like the
[1:24:32] chaff of the summer threshing floors
[1:24:33] this is a man when that rocky now and
[1:24:36] the wind carried them away that no place
[1:24:38] was found for them and the stone that
[1:24:40] smote the image became a great mountain
[1:24:44] that stone amen that smote the image
[1:24:47] became a great mountain amen and filled
[1:24:52] the whole earth praise God amen
[1:24:56] now I like this verse here in Daniel
[1:24:59] 2:44 in st. chapter I recommend you read
[1:25:02] this at home and in the days of these
[1:25:04] kings these physical kings that we're
[1:25:07] just in that statue
[1:25:08] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom
[1:25:11] so they're saying no their kingdom but
[1:25:13] God said no his kingdom amen he's been
[1:25:17] setting enough which shall never be
[1:25:19] destroyed and the Kingdom shall not be
[1:25:22] left to other people but it shall break
[1:25:25] in pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:25:27] and the it shall stand forever
[1:25:30] hallelujah amen
[1:25:32] praise God so the Saints we're bringing
[1:25:34] it from the spiritual internal bringing
[1:25:38] it to a physical sea now we're turning
[1:25:40] to physical God's gonna have a physical
[1:25:41] Kingdom hey man praise God but it's got
[1:25:45] to start in you first the other word cuz
[1:25:48] he wants people with character to rule
[1:25:50] and reign in this kingdom right next
[1:25:53] alright well if you read Daniel chapter
[1:25:56] 7 this the only Chatwood book in the in
[1:26:01] the Old Testament that you find the word
[1:26:03] Saints
[1:26:04] normally you see the but the word Saints
[1:26:07] in the New Testament this is the only
[1:26:09] chapter or only book that you see the
[1:26:11] word Saints I think it's two or three
[1:26:13] times that you see it in there talking
[1:26:14] about how the Saints were gonna possess
[1:26:16] this kingdom I was talking about you in
[1:26:19] this sense
[1:26:20] Daniel was seeing things amen that
[1:26:22] that's Amen I just put myself in that
[1:26:26] word next Amen now brother Brown says in
[1:26:30] the future home God already took up his
[1:26:32] abode potentially the kingdom of God is
[1:26:35] in the earth now right in the hearts of
[1:26:40] his Saints it's his attributes that he
[1:26:44] began in the beginning
[1:26:46] hey now his attributes as redeemed are
[1:26:50] you reading that
[1:26:51] what's he waiting to redeem the earth to
[1:26:56] set his attributes on it to really rain
[1:27:00] a man just like that just like Adam had
[1:27:03] to full reign over the earth they meant
[1:27:05] to fulfill exactly his predestinated
[1:27:07] planet do you see it brother Branham
[1:27:09] says and in Christ the mystery of God
[1:27:12] revealed then our headship is a kingdom
[1:27:15] the kingdom of God is within you said
[1:27:18] the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a
[1:27:21] denomination we belong to a kingdom and
[1:27:23] the Kingdom is the word of God made
[1:27:25] spirit and life in our own life bring it
[1:27:28] to pass every promise in this day as it
[1:27:31] did in that day when the wording God was
[1:27:34] one and the word and God is one of his
[1:27:36] church today making it the headship of
[1:27:39] the body that is redeemed to bring the
[1:27:41] message in the last day and be taken up
[1:27:45] from the dead in the resurrection to go
[1:27:48] back and restore again as Adam and Eve
[1:27:52] in the beginning in the Garden of Eden
[1:27:53] that's that's right there that's the
[1:27:56] plan of God right there
[1:27:57] raised God and that's what God is doing
[1:28:01] right now yet the world has no clue
[1:28:05] where Gerald the world has no clue what
[1:28:09] a privileged people we are such a man
[1:28:12] I'm so thankful to be part of that
[1:28:14] Redeemer amen
[1:28:15] next so Saints is the key
[1:28:18] them of God is is it external or is it
[1:28:20] internal but Dick said it it's both but
[1:28:27] it's got to be an internal first
[1:28:29] manifest on the exterior amen
[1:28:32] see it's both hallelujah
[1:28:36] has to begin internally within you in
[1:28:38] order to manifest externally that's the
[1:28:41] kingdom of God amen next the Saints I
[1:28:44] just want you all to read Matthew
[1:28:45] chapter 6 with me just a few verses
[1:28:47] Matthew of burden or the Lord's Prayer
[1:28:50] I'll read the first verse you can read
[1:28:51] this and so on after this manner
[1:28:54] therefore pray our Father which are in
[1:28:56] heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:28:58] kingdom come Thy will be done on earth

[1:29:04] daily bread forgive us our debts as we
[1:29:08] forgive our debtors and all together and
[1:29:11] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[1:29:14] us from evil for thine is the kingdom
[1:29:17] and the power and the glory forever amen
[1:29:23] praise God that's that's a powerful
[1:29:26] verse that right there is everything
[1:29:29] that we just talked about in that little
[1:29:33] verse and we read that right now we just
[1:29:35] repeat it and we know it but we're not
[1:29:37] thinking one thing about what Jesus was
[1:29:39] talking about that's the kingdom of God
[1:29:41] stands but it has to be established in
[1:29:44] you first in you so that it can manifest
[1:29:47] on the outside say me how many love the
[1:29:49] Lord praise God let's stand to our feet
