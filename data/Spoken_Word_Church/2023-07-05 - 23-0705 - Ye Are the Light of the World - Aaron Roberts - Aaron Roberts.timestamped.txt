[29:15] said if I do not the works of my father
[29:17] then condemn me see but if you can't
[29:19] believe me believe the works that I do
[29:21] they testify of who I
[29:23] am he says you see that blind darkened
[29:26] hour that they live in they could
[29:27] couldn't see it they just couldn't
[29:30] understand and it's about how could he
[29:32] be the Son of God when he was born right
[29:34] down here in Bethlehem if they only know
[29:37] the word said that he would come that
[29:38] way why his father Joseph is a carpenter
[29:41] his mother why it's actually believed
[29:42] amongst the Brethren that she was that
[29:45] he was born
[29:46] illegitimately see but yet the word said
[29:49] that he said search the scriptures for
[29:51] in them you think you have eternal life
[29:53] but they are the very ones that testify
[29:56] who I am they are the ones that testify
[29:58] of me this holy scriptures then what was
[30:01] he God's light no wonder he said I am
[30:04] the light of the world not only did he
[30:06] say I'm the light of the world but he
[30:08] said ye are the light if his word is in
[30:11] you bearing record of itself then you
[30:13] are the light of the world noce we find
[30:15] out light of each age made manifest just
[30:20] the sameen so not only did he say I'm
[30:23] the light of the world but as he said
[30:25] search the scriptures because they
[30:27] identify who I am that I am the light of
[30:29] the world then the scriptures also
[30:32] identify who we are that we are the
[30:34] light of the world Amen we are God's
[30:36] light we are the manifestation of Jesus
[30:39] Christ in our day amen and and I just
[30:42] want to look at a few things tonight um
[30:46] I was uh had the opportunity to talk to
[30:48] a young sister uh pretty recently and
[30:51] and we were we were uh she was
[30:54] discussing some things
[30:56] and you know when you young
[31:00] people and when you when you see
[31:05] people and even even olders older ones
[31:07] we have they have the this same kind of
[31:11] issue this problem that they deal with
[31:12] him and it's you know it's like ye are
[31:15] the light of the
[31:17] world and you know she's like well you
[31:21] know you don't seem like you're reaching

[31:28] play instruments and I can you know I I
[31:30] love to cook and I do all these things
[31:32] and she's like I'm not it don't seem
[31:33] like I'm ever reaching anybody you know
[31:35] it's like you know I get ridiculed at
[31:37] school I get ridiculed at work and all
[31:39] these type things and all these
[31:40] different things and I told her I said
[31:42] listen I said if you do one thing for
[31:44] God and you bless five people right
[31:47] that's five people that God called you
[31:49] to bless abolutely it's not the number
[31:52] of people and and you know it's not
[31:54] we're not keeping score no right amen
[31:57] God never called us to be uh great uh
[32:01] singers evangelists all these type
[32:03] things he called us to be faithful to
[32:05] what he called us to do that's the main
[32:07] thing he said you know my good and
[32:09] faithful servant is is the standard that
[32:11] God has for us are we faithful to what
[32:14] he called us to and he says you know ye
[32:16] are the light of the world well you know
[32:18] you are the light to the part of the
[32:20] world that you live in that's it you're
[32:22] that light you don't have you're not to
[32:25] try to as really appreciated what
[32:28] brother tic had to say you know talking
[32:30] about you know because people want to
[32:32] hop on a plane and travel on the other
[32:34] side of the world and and they what they
[32:36] call what they call missions he said
[32:37] really it's not missions they're not
[32:39] really doing a whole lot you know but if
[32:41] you can be the light that the world can
[32:44] see where you are amen you do what God
[32:48] called you to do and I said you know
[32:50] because it's
[32:52] not you know it's not like you know
[32:56] we're here and you know I don't know how
[32:58] many people will listen to this sermon
[33:02] and so you know I'm not I'm not one
[33:03] trying to you know and I don't know
[33:05] anybody else would be but you know every
[33:07] now and then you can go on YouTube and
[33:08] find out how many people listen to your
[33:11] sermon but you know I'm not I'm I'm not
[33:13] calculating how many times people listen
[33:15] to brother Wade's sermon and how many
[33:18] people listen to brother Bob's sermon
[33:19] and you know that I feel bad because uh
[33:22] I don't get the same number you know or
[33:25] or whatever you know it's not I'm not
[33:27] looking at that because you know what if
[33:29] I have one person if I had one person
[33:32] tell me tonight when when I get done if
[33:34] one person tells me they got something
[33:36] out of the sermon if one person's
[33:37] blessed then you know what it counts for
[33:39] all if one person is blessed if one
[33:41] person is edified in the body of Christ
[33:44] then you know what I feel like I've done
[33:45] my job because I I can I can just yield
[33:48] myself and I can do what I can do but I
[33:50] can't try to to do too you know whatever
[33:53] I just got to Guild myself to the Lord
[33:56] and let the Lord Lord work and however
[33:58] he decides to work then praise God I'm
[34:00] not trying to build myself up because
[34:02] the problem is is you know you you get
[34:04] out of the will of God when you try to
[34:06] make something of yourself you know
[34:09] there's a story years ago and uh I was
[34:12] thinking about there was years ago there
[34:14] was these young men that uh they had
[34:16] went through uh OCS or whatever and they
[34:19] got their they got their uh they got
[34:22] their gold bars you know the L
[34:24] Lieutenant bars you know second
[34:25] Lieutenant they get that little gold bar
[34:27] they got them on their on their
[34:29] shoulders and you know what they got so
[34:31] excited because they had them gold bars
[34:33] wherever they was enlisted people they
[34:35] would SK their schedule and they would
[34:38] run out there so when the enlisted
[34:39] people come by they could get people to
[34:41] slot
[34:43] them because they were so excited why
[34:45] because they wanted know wanted
[34:47] everybody to know hey I am a
[34:50] lieutenant I've reached something and
[34:52] you've got to salute
[34:54] me well you know people got really tired
[34:57] of them for their arrogancy
[35:02] and you know there was a an older
[35:05] officer come and he told he took he took
[35:08] one of the officers and he took them to
[35:10] a to a bar and there was a bunch of
[35:13] soldiers in there and and different
[35:15] people in there and he told him he said
[35:17] listen he said those are your
[35:20] people he said you are to lead them
[35:24] right but he said don't ever get to the
[35:27] point where you don't realize that
[35:28] you're going to learn from
[35:31] them just because you got your
[35:34] commission doesn't mean that you're at
[35:38] the
[35:40] Apex there was a lot of
[35:43] soldiers that went to Vietnam and you
[35:46] know they had uh they got their what
[35:48] they call their Buttercup bar they got
[35:51] their Lieutenant bar and you know what
[35:53] they had you know what they got to go
[35:55] with them they wouldn't even let them
[35:57] lead even though they were commissioned
[35:59] to lead you know they would not let them
[36:00] lead people in
[36:02] battle you know what they done they got
[36:05] some old hard rough Gruff
[36:10] sergeant and you know what he had to
[36:12] follow that Sergeant around and that
[36:13] Sergeant was like I'm going to show you
[36:15] the ropes I'm going to teach you what
[36:17] you've got to do if you're going to be a
[36:20] good leader you need to learn these
[36:22] things because you're not going to learn
[36:24] it just out of a book right it took
[36:29] experience and you know when you get to
[36:31] the point where you ever think that you
[36:32] know if we ever get to the point where
[36:34] we're arrogant or we don't think that
[36:36] God can do you know we're not reaching
[36:38] some point we just got to realize God's
[36:41] in control and just yeld our and let God
[36:44] have have his way with us right I you
[36:47] know because we can't think higher or
[36:49] lower than of ourselves than what God
[36:51] has already thought of us and so it's
[36:54] just for us to be faithful to what God
[36:56] is has called us to don't I'm not I'm
[36:59] not trying to to be something greater
[37:01] but I don't but I don't want to be
[37:04] slacking in what God has called me to do
[37:07] that's right
[37:10] amen
[37:13] so brother brand was speaking here and
[37:17] this is from sir we would see
[37:19] Jesus and he's talking
[37:22] about the
[37:24] life and he was talking about Paul and
[37:27] Moses and and he says he said how many
[37:31] knows that the angel that led Moses
[37:32] through the Wilderness was Christ the
[37:35] angel of the Covenant sure it was Jesus
[37:37] said I come from God I go to God that's
[37:39] why he said before Abraham was I am that
[37:42] was God speaking out and when Paul was
[37:45] on the road to Damascus that was what
[37:47] what it was that that struck him what
[37:50] was it that struck him a like put his
[37:52] put his eyes out I come from God I go to
[37:55] God that same that life in the church
[37:58] brings forth the same light that was
[38:01] there same Works same signs same wonders
[38:04] same Miracles same thing Jesus Christ
[38:07] the same yesterday today and forever he
[38:10] said God be blessed forever more so it's
[38:11] the same life that Jesus done the works
[38:14] that I do shall you do also it's the
[38:17] same life the same
[38:18] miracles in John in John chapter 1 it
[38:23] says verse four says in him was life and
[38:26] the life was the light of men amen and
[38:29] the light shineth in darkness and the
[38:31] Darkness comprehended at night that's
[38:33] right and it
[38:35] says that was the True Light which lith
[38:38] every man that cometh into the world so
[38:42] it takes God to bring the light but it
[38:44] also takes God for us to recognize that
[38:48] light and for and he shown the light but
[38:50] they didn't recognize it but he was the
[38:52] light that was promised to come into the
[38:54] world and he come in the world and and
[38:56] brought forth the light for people to
[38:58] see but but to those who were
[39:01] predestined to see the light they saw
[39:03] that
[39:05] light you know and many times people
[39:07] that see in the scripture you know many
[39:09] times the the word the word comes which
[39:12] is the the light it comes and it makes
[39:14] itself known and you know all the way
[39:16] through the scripture we find many
[39:18] people that the light came to and God
[39:20] made himself known you know God came to
[39:24] Cain and told and gave Cain the perfect
[39:27] understanding you know even if he didn't
[39:30] fully understand God told him what to do
[39:33] he didn't have a revelation but God told
[39:35] him he said if you'll do as your brother
[39:37] you'll be accepted you know there's many
[39:39] of them through the scripture that they
[39:41] knew what the truth was and God pointed
[39:44] it out and led them but you know they
[39:46] were the ones that had to make that
[39:47] choice whether they would accept it or
[39:49] not and and here you know the different
[39:52] ones brother random was speaking in the
[39:54] message painted face Jezebel and and
[39:57] brother bram's praying here and he said
[39:58] he said send some more Tish bites Elijah
[40:02] along that's really that'll really stand
[40:05] regardless granted father and preach
[40:08] that they can see the light speaking
[40:10] because it takes it takes a fivefold
[40:12] Ministry for the people to see the light
[40:15] it takes the word has to be brought
[40:17] through somebody the the seed has to
[40:19] come through the body and so the he's
[40:21] speaking here see it h that they can see
[40:23] the light it takes why because Elijah
[40:26] came to make he was the prophet of the
[40:28] day and he brought the light for the
[40:29] people to see and then brother oh yes
[40:31] Jezebel had the light plenty of it she
[40:34] had Mount Carmel like to see that God
[40:37] answered prayer and performed Miracles
[40:40] so here is seeing that what was taking
[40:42] place and we know what took place on in
[40:45] it with
[40:46] Jezebel and on Mount Carell she knew it
[40:50] but she wasn't willing to sacrifice and
[40:52] to walk in the light and so we know that
[40:55] you know different ones as there you
[40:58] know when Elijah came and began to speak
[41:00] to them and tell them what was take
[41:02] place when Ahab and and you know the
[41:06] prophets of of baale you know when when
[41:08] they had the word and he come and made
[41:11] himself known and told and what was
[41:12] going to take place but you know they
[41:14] had gotten away from because they were
[41:17] so influenced by that day by the people
[41:20] and the and the false doctrines that had
[41:23] it permeated their their lives every
[41:25] single day that they had gotten away
[41:27] from what was truth and they began to
[41:29] walk in the things of the people that
[41:31] was around them and we know that when
[41:33] Ahab married Jezebel and she brought in
[41:35] all of her false Doctrine religions and
[41:37] her false gods and all these things in
[41:39] and it corrupted all of Israel and and
[41:42] you know when he come but you know he
[41:43] raised up Elijah to go down there and
[41:45] tell them that this is wrong and you've
[41:48] gotten away from what God has told you
[41:50] what God has brought you to and you know
[41:52] but he began to tell them but you know
[41:54] what she did not believe that because
[41:56] she wanted to hold on to her own things
[41:58] but you know when you know she could not
[42:01] she when all of those prophets were down
[42:04] there and they were on Mount Carmel and
[42:05] they had that Showdown and God killed
[42:08] all of them and accepted Elijah's
[42:10] sacrifice and burned it all up and
[42:12] except you know uh took all the water
[42:14] and everything that was bured up you
[42:15] know there was no way that she couldn't
[42:17] deny that the supernatural took place
[42:20] because it had happened and for and so
[42:22] you know he was saying see that's
[42:24] exactly but she failed to walk in in the
[42:27] light but you know it wasn't that she
[42:29] was uh not without
[42:32] excuse because she had seen the
[42:34] supernatural take place
[42:37] right and there's many people in the
[42:39] same way today you know God has done so
[42:42] much and spoke to people and told them
[42:45] absolutely amen and it's it's amazing
[42:47] how people have come and you know they
[42:49] you've heard people talk and stand there
[42:51] and and absolutely read from the
[42:54] scripture and I mean they can take they
[42:57] can take the the word and lay it out
[42:59] just so perfect and I mean you can't I
[43:01] mean exactly what the scripture says and
[43:04] lay it out perfectly to a te and then
[43:06] turn around and say that's wrong yeah
[43:09] right how in the world can you stand up
[43:11] and believe that God sent a prophet and
[43:14] know the scriptures and I perfectly
[43:16] identify the scriptures the day and the
[43:18] hour in which we live and know that this
[43:20] is the truth and know what what he said
[43:23] even about water baptism of one God
[43:25] whatever and then turn around and say
[43:27] that's nothing but come straight out of
[43:29] the pits of hell that's totally false
[43:32] yeah well how how can you how can you
[43:35] have an
[43:36] excuse how can how can you stand in the
[43:39] day of judgment and not be fully
[43:41] condemned by that when you stand up and
[43:44] you can identify well you know there's
[43:46] there is no uh there's no wiggle room
[43:49] there's no there's absolutely nothing
[43:52] because either you either you walk in it
[43:54] or you don't walk in it because either
[43:56] you've seen the light and even if you
[43:58] don't walk in it you can't deny that
[44:00] you've seen the
[44:01] light and so many people they theyve
[44:04] walked in and when God has spoke to them
[44:06] and told them these things what was
[44:08] truth and they had to see the light
[44:10] whether you walk in it or not you know
[44:12] what you're still responsible for that
[44:15] amen and it's a terrible day that we
[44:17] live in but it's a great day that we
[44:19] live in am yes it is because you know
[44:22] what because you see people and you see
[44:25] people that all of the hardships and all
[44:27] the struggles and everything that people
[44:29] have been through and you know they've
[44:30] been knocked down and they get right
[44:32] back up and they keep going and they get
[44:34] knocked down and they get right back up
[44:36] and they keep going and people say well
[44:38] I don't know how you make it well you
[44:39] know what it's not me that's doing it
[44:42] but it's the one that's inside of me
[44:44] that's doing it but he's the one that's
[44:46] leading me he's the one that's giving me
[44:47] the grace to do that he's the one that's
[44:49] giving me the strength to give to do
[44:51] this he's the one that's given me the
[44:52] desire to do this I couldn't do it in in
[44:54] my own right but you know what then but
[44:57] you know what if we just trust God then
[44:59] he's the one because through him we're
[45:01] Overcomers we're not Overcomers in
[45:04] ourselves but we overcome through him
[45:06] he's the he's the one that's
[45:09] overcome so when when we look at the
[45:12] when we look at our sacrifice it's not
[45:14] it's not whether whether we are
[45:17] accepted it's whether our sacrifice is
[45:23] accepted so we have to look to see what
[45:25] God has
[45:26] done and if we can just see what God's
[45:29] done for
[45:34] us
[45:37] now when when God
[45:40] called the the children of
[45:43] Israel and he began to lead them and you
[45:47] know when he prophesied that he would
[45:49] bring them out as brother tic was
[45:51] talking about you know coming out of
[45:53] Egypt and here they come out of the out
[45:54] of the God made the promise and here
[45:56] they're come God's going to call them
[45:58] out and bring them into the place that
[45:59] God called them to you know God made the
[46:02] promise and he's bringing that he was
[46:04] going to fulfill his word
[46:06] amen you know and and in the process of
[46:09] time and he comes you know he wanted to
[46:12] bring the people into a place where he
[46:13] could fellowship with them and he wanted
[46:16] to reveal himself to them and you know
[46:19] not just not just in the um not just in
[46:23] the prophet and and the and the word but
[46:25] you know he had the Tabernacle set
[46:27] up and you know and each one of those
[46:30] each one of those items each particular
[46:32] thing in the in the making of the
[46:34] Tabernacle each part of it speaks of
[46:36] Christ and each part of it speaks of the
[46:38] Journey of the believer and and the
[46:40] God's fellowship with them and you know
[46:43] as as they came and he began to tell
[46:45] Moses and he took Moses into the
[46:47] mountain and he began to speak to him
[46:48] and he got to see these things and he
[46:50] came down and he began to lay out every
[46:53] aspect of the Tabernacle for them to
[46:55] have fellowship with God because God was
[46:57] to fellowship with them and he began to
[47:00] see them in this in this building of
[47:02] this of this Tabernacle each piece each
[47:05] color everything has has a has a
[47:07] ordinance and everything has a
[47:09] specific uh condition and and all that
[47:12] may has a reason for all that to be
[47:15] there and you know when he when he went
[47:16] through all of that you know it was him
[47:18] making himself known to them now
[47:21] sometimes they were just like well we
[47:22] don't understand why that was a certain
[47:24] color was made a certain way or a
[47:27] certain cubic but you know all those
[47:28] things Express Christ and you know when
[47:31] he when he went through all of that and
[47:33] he raised up and they began to make this
[47:35] Tabernacle and each piece had to be made
[47:37] a certain way and you know as they
[47:39] worked in in in Exodus chter 40 I want
[47:43] to read this and here they go and
[47:45] they're building the Tabernacle and
[47:46] laying it all out and in verse 33 of of
[47:50] chapter 40 of Exodus the scripture says
[47:53] and when he reared up the court round
[47:55] about the Tabernacle and the altar he
[47:57] set up the hanging of the Court gate so
[48:00] Moses finished the work so here's the
[48:04] prophet laying out what had to be done
[48:06] and he finished putting out all the
[48:08] things in place because he was the one
[48:10] that had had the people doing the work
[48:13] and when he finished what God had called
[48:14] him to do he finished the work so
[48:16] everything was set in place it says then
[48:18] a cloud covered the tent of the
[48:20] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[48:23] filled the Tabernacle amen he said and
[48:26] Moses was not able to enter into the
[48:28] tent of the congregation because the
[48:30] cloud Abode thereon and the glory of the
[48:32] Lord filled the Tabernacle and when the
[48:35] cloud was taken up from the Tabernacle
[48:37] the children of Israel went onward in
[48:40] their in all their Journeys and then you
[48:44] know in
[48:45] Isaiah here in Isaiah 60 verse 1-3 and
[48:49] it says arise Shine for thy light is
[48:51] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[48:53] upon thee for behold the the darkness
[48:56] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[48:58] the people but the glory shall but the
[49:01] Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory
[49:03] shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles
[49:06] shall come to thy light and Kings to the
[49:09] brightness of thy Rising now what I want
[49:12] to look at tonight is when when you see
[49:15] that here's here's Moses laying the
[49:17] Tabernacle out and when when he was
[49:20] finished with it so when the man had
[49:22] finished their part of it then God come
[49:24] to indwell the the Tabernacle because
[49:27] God come to when God saw that they had
[49:30] done what they were supposed to do then
[49:32] God was uh pleased with what had taken
[49:35] place and then the cloud came down and
[49:37] you know one of the things that when you
[49:39] start to study what was interesting
[49:40] about this is many times you know we
[49:42] think about uh you know we we think of
[49:45] of Cloudy being this gloom and doom and
[49:48] and dark and all this kind of thing but
[49:50] you don't realize but when you actually
[49:52] study this when the glory of the Lord
[49:54] came down into the cloud came down there
[49:56] was actually light there there was
[49:59] actually a light that filled that
[50:01] Tabernacle that's right and it because
[50:03] of the light and because of the glory of
[50:05] the Lord that filled that Tabernacle
[50:06] that God has was pleased with what they
[50:09] had done because that was where he
[50:11] wanted to meet them when all of that
[50:13] took place then the glory of the Lord
[50:16] came down and they were not able to
[50:17] enter in even when when Solomon built
[50:21] the temp built the temple and he set
[50:23] everything in order and and had done all
[50:25] the work that he was supposed to do and
[50:27] everything was said just exactly correct
[50:30] then when exactly the same thing
[50:32] happened with the glory of the Lord the
[50:34] cloud came down and filled that shakina
[50:36] of Glory filled the tabern the
[50:38] Tabernacle the temple and it was so much
[50:40] that the priest could not Minister there
[50:42] because it had done but you know it was
[50:44] God showing that he was pleased with
[50:46] what they had done right and here they
[50:48] are in this Tabernacle they had come
[50:50] down and done exactly what God had
[50:52] wanted them to do and he was filled the
[50:55] the whole Tabernacle and they had this
[50:56] Supernatural happening there and now he
[50:59] filled the whole place and he was there
[51:01] showing that he was before them and that
[51:04] was their place to have fellowship with
[51:07] him and here he is he's filled this this
[51:09] uh
[51:10] Tabernacle and then when the T when the
[51:13] uh anointing went up when the cloud went
[51:15] up and he said then they were able to
[51:17] Journey from there wherever the cloud
[51:21] went and you know and it says here in
[51:24] Isaiah it says you know
[51:26] arise and shine for thy light is come
[51:28] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[51:30] thee and so it's showing that this Cloud
[51:33] this Glory that had come down was like
[51:35] to these people am and you know many
[51:38] times people see these great things you
[51:40] know and you see so many people they
[51:42] talk about what happened many years ago
[51:44] and these these great happenings that
[51:46] has taken place and they oh if we can
[51:48] just go back to the great days of of
[51:50] yester year what's taking place or what
[51:52] happened five years ago or what happened
[51:54] here or there and not realizing that God
[51:57] has continued to move on because when he
[52:00] came down in in the in the Tabernacle
[52:02] there and he showed his glory to the
[52:04] people but when he went up that wasn't
[52:06] the only thing that he had for them
[52:08] because when he went beyond that and he
[52:10] went up and the cloud was there to guide
[52:12] them when he went forward they weren't
[52:14] supposed to still stand there and hold
[52:16] their hands up and say well praise God
[52:18] look what God done it was time for them
[52:20] to move on and so many times people are
[52:22] still stuck in the same spot looking
[52:24] back and not realizing that it's time to
[52:26] move on God is calling us to higher
[52:29] places to Heavenly places in Christ
[52:31] Jesus to move on from where you come
[52:33] from because God is moving and he's
[52:36] wanting you to see that when when the
[52:38] glory of the Lord has come down to you
[52:40] now it's time for it's to catch your
[52:42] vision for you to move on there's
[52:44] greater things for you to
[52:46] see because you know what it wasn't just
[52:49] that the Shak kind of Glory came down
[52:51] into the temple but it was for them to
[52:53] come in and go there for that high
[52:55] priest to go Beyond the Veil to come
[52:57] into the place because brother bam said
[52:59] when he went beyond there he said that
[53:01] Shak of Glory was always in there he
[53:03] said he might have been it might have
[53:05] been dark in the outer Court it might
[53:07] have been dark in the inner court but
[53:08] when he went into the holy of holies
[53:10] there was no Darkness why because he
[53:12] stepped into the Shina of glory and when
[53:14] he went stepped in then you know what
[53:16] there was all the brightness why because
[53:18] Christ or God stayed behind there all
[53:20] the time and it's the same way with you
[53:23] and I we can continue on but you know is
[53:25] get behind the holy of holies to get in
[53:28] there where Christ is all the time where
[53:31] we can have fellowship with him all the
[53:38] time see from this is from the hidden
[53:40] life and he says but look he talking
[53:43] about the
[53:44] outside and how dark it was he said but
[53:46] look on the inside he said old brother
[53:49] the man that was in there what did he
[53:52] come in there see every Earthly light
[53:54] every artificial light was shut off from
[53:57] him and the only light that he had under
[53:59] the wings of the cherubims was the shika
[54:02] light a real soft Holy Light that never
[54:05] went out he said I don't care what the
[54:07] sun did what the lamps did what anything
[54:10] else he that lived in that presence
[54:12] walks in the light day and night that's
[54:16] he said that's where we need to be no
[54:18] matter what your experience is he said
[54:20] if it's heartaches if it's troubles if
[54:22] it's upsets if it's this that or the
[54:24] other you're still walking in the light
[54:26] of God you're living in the shik glory
[54:28] living there where Jesus is in his
[54:31] presence that all things work together
[54:33] for good to them that love God and
[54:35] you'll you'll love him and you're
[54:37] walking in that mellow soft sweet humble
[54:40] Christian Life wouldn't you like to walk
[54:43] like that there's not a person here but
[54:45] wants to live in there and friends
[54:48] that's where you should live if you want
[54:51] to know what know the secret of this
[54:54] life if you want to know why the these
[54:57] things is One Day by the grace of God he
[55:00] took me in there that's right that's
[55:02] what does it it's nothing in yourself
[55:04] you don't live for yourself no more you
[55:07] live for others so when you come in
[55:10] there and see that light when it brings
[55:12] it down then it brings you to a place
[55:13] where you see that it's him and you
[55:16] together he brings you into a place that
[55:17] nobody else knows
[55:21] about it's a personal experience amen
[55:25] and see if you come to that place and
[55:26] you know what it's not we don't have to
[55:28] worry about all the heartaches and the
[55:29] troubles and all things we're looking at
[55:31] being in in that shikina Glory see when
[55:33] the when the high priest when he went in
[55:35] behind the veil and he had the blood and
[55:37] he sprinkled The Mercy Seat you know he
[55:39] didn't worry about what was going on in
[55:41] his family he didn't worry about what
[55:43] was going on outside he didn't worry
[55:45] about why because he had stepped into an
[55:48] eternal presence of God he had stepped
[55:50] before the before the Altar and when he
[55:52] was stood there then it was just him and
[55:54] God and what what he was to do was to
[55:56] offer God the the offering for him to
[56:00] for and and it's the same way it's not
[56:02] you know because so many times we get so
[56:04] sidetracked with so many things of the
[56:06] world and what was going all the way
[56:07] around us but you know what it is is
[56:09] when you get behind the veil you know we
[56:11] keep our eyes on him
[56:14] right not to be worried about the things
[56:17] of the
[56:18] world because you know what all things
[56:21] work together for the good whatever God
[56:24] has we praise God we can thank God for
[56:26] it
[56:28] amen and it the same way when when
[56:30] Solomon when he dedicated the temple the
[56:34] glory you know it was so great that he
[56:36] went in there but you know was to come
[56:37] to a place to have
[56:40] fellowship and to see see God
[56:44] right let's have have fellowship with
[56:50] God now I was looking up some things
[56:54] about you know about light in the in the
[56:57] scripture and and and so there's a
[56:58] couple of things that I was looking at
[57:00] one of them was uh the the light there
[57:03] in the in the Tabernacle and the the
[57:05] temple and you know when you look at
[57:08] what light
[57:09] means in the scripture you know light it
[57:13] symbolizes or means you know it refers
[57:15] to God's presence goodness truth
[57:20] Holiness
[57:22] salvation it means hope and
[57:26] provision
[57:29] Salvation And it it's an answer in the
[57:32] darkest times whatever whatever happens
[57:35] you know God is God's light will always
[57:38] bring an answer am even in the dark when
[57:40] it doesn't look like there's a way out
[57:42] God makes a way
[57:44] out he said light is the first thing
[57:46] that God created and it's the source of
[57:48] all
[57:50] life see light serves as a symbol of
[57:53] Life have happiness prosperity and he
[57:57] says even in a wider sense a perfect
[58:00] being yeah and that's what caught my
[58:02] attention when I was reading that it was
[58:04] like it it serves as as a lie and
[58:07] immortality all those things when you
[58:09] look at light in the scripture that's
[58:11] what it's talking about all these
[58:13] different things and what struck me when
[58:14] he was talking about a perfect
[58:17] being and you know brother brand said in
[58:19] the in the message having
[58:21] conferences he says I tell you the truth
[58:23] I lie not there's no no man can take the
[58:26] doctrine that I preach and disprove it
[58:29] amen he said there's no one can do it I
[58:32] have never seen anyone could do it it's
[58:34] the gospel truth the discernments of the
[58:37] spirit is perfect no man can ever say
[58:40] that it's ever not been perfect and I'll
[58:43] tell you now there is a perfect
[58:46] place a perfect heaven a perfect God a
[58:50] perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect
[58:52] atonement a perfect being for
[58:55] you and that's what it struck me when I
[58:57] was looking at that when it said a
[58:59] perfect being because you know what
[59:00] brother R said there's a perfect being
[59:02] for you yes amen and you know many times
[59:04] people what is that you know what does
[59:06] that mean we know people think well you
[59:08] know he's just talking about Jesus
[59:10] Christ no he's not talking about just
[59:13] Jesus Christ but he's talking about you
[59:17] right
[59:20] yeah see when you when you begin to look
[59:22] at it because when you when you begin to
[59:25] study this when you look at this perfect
[59:27] being what is the perfect being it's the
[59:31] statue of a perfect man it's the it's
[59:33] the because what is it it's the light of
[59:35] the God's word is bringing you to that
[59:37] place it takes the light of the word
[59:38] that's going to bring you up the stature
[59:40] of a perfect man why because it's
[59:42] bringing out out of you from you out of
[59:45] the old out of the darkness into the
[59:48] light and it's bringing you up y right
[59:52] and so all the all of the the uh
[59:56] virtues you know coming into Faith
[59:59] that's a light there's a light of the
[1:00:01] word that brings you to that place there
[1:00:03] is a light of the word that brings you
[1:00:04] to Virtue that light because it takes
[1:00:07] the light of the word to shine that on
[1:00:09] you but it's not just the light shining
[1:00:11] on the word but it's the light coming
[1:00:13] inside of you and indwelling you and and
[1:00:15] making the life that word live the make
[1:00:19] and then the light is on the inside of
[1:00:20] you and it comes dwelling from the
[1:00:22] inside out because if you're the light
[1:00:25] then the word is growing and then
[1:00:27] there's a growing Light Within what is
[1:00:28] it you're coming up the stature of a
[1:00:30] perfect man because then as you come
[1:00:32] from knowledge Temperance patience all
[1:00:34] of these things are being made known
[1:00:36] because it's the light of the word being
[1:00:37] made manifest in you and we can see how
[1:00:40] that comes from the dark place why
[1:00:42] because if you have any of the old man
[1:00:45] there and you know even when you come in
[1:00:47] to be born again you come into the into
[1:00:50] the kingdom of God you know what you're
[1:00:51] still fighting this old man you're still
[1:00:54] fighting the darkness of this world
[1:00:56] you're still tied to this earth you're
[1:00:58] still fighting that but it takes the
[1:01:00] word it takes the light of the word to
[1:01:02] bring you to the place that you overcome
[1:01:05] that so that's what it is it's the light
[1:01:07] that comes and he's bringing us into
[1:01:10] that so the world can see
[1:01:13] us see it's not just as brother said
[1:01:15] it's not just living for ourselves but
[1:01:17] we're living for others we're to we're
[1:01:19] to make him known
[1:01:21] amen that we can the world can see yes
[1:01:25] see the see the light that God has given
[1:01:29] us let your light so shine before men
[1:01:32] amen that they can
[1:01:34] see you know we wonder why certain
[1:01:37] things happen in our lives and you know
[1:01:39] uh talking talking to brother Richie and
[1:01:42] you know uh one of the things I was I
[1:01:44] was thinking about was you know many
[1:01:46] people just we we kind of get in a in a
[1:01:49] situation sometimes where we just
[1:01:51] everything comes get uh normal or just
[1:01:56] common or whatever and you know one of
[1:01:58] the things I was thinking about that I
[1:01:59] had in my notes I was going to mention
[1:02:02] Sunday was that you know here we are and
[1:02:05] you know we come and you know how many
[1:02:07] wants to see a miracle well let me tell
[1:02:09] you we saw two Miracles here Sunday and
[1:02:13] the both of them

[1:02:17] things that brother Richie's been
[1:02:19] through and you know his mom when he was
[1:02:21] telling us giving us this testimony you
[1:02:23] know when he had ankle bone yeah and
[1:02:26] there was no way for him to walk right
[1:02:30] and you know his and yet his mom carried
[1:02:32] him through prayer line after prayer
[1:02:33] line after prayer
[1:02:35] line and had people everywhere praying
[1:02:38] for her because you know what she got to
[1:02:40] the place where you know what there was
[1:02:42] nothing the doctors were going to do
[1:02:44] right they didn't know what to do right
[1:02:47] maybe amputate his
[1:02:50] foot but you know what God had other
[1:02:53] ideas
[1:02:56] and some little tiny woman Sister
[1:03:00] Christine had Faith to
[1:03:03] believe and she carried that little boy
[1:03:06] everywhere and she didn't take no for an
[1:03:09] answer until one day God honored that
[1:03:13] lady's Faith amen and put an ankle bone
[1:03:16] in there where he could
[1:03:19] walk and you know so many times if if

[1:06:21] one that had cancer and you know had

[1:06:54] corner you got that far you know because
[1:06:56] the is the god that brought you this far
[1:06:59] is the one that'll bring you all the way
[1:07:01] and I was like you know what the devil
[1:07:03] tries but you know the devil lost the
[1:07:04] first time and he's losing the second
[1:07:07] time we just don't we just don't quit
[1:07:10] because God is the one that's the Healer
[1:07:12] and he's already paid for it and it's a
[1:07:14] finished work of Calvary and you
[1:07:16] couldn't you couldn't if he was here
[1:07:18] tonight his brother R said if he was
[1:07:19] here tonight he couldn't do more for you
[1:07:21] than what he's already done if you can
[1:07:23] just believe
[1:07:24] that's right just take him as a as
[1:07:27] childlike Faith am see just the
[1:07:30] childlike Faith you know many times in
[1:07:33] our lives and we all these different
[1:07:36] things that happen in our lives and we
[1:07:38] wonder why things happen that way but
[1:07:40] you know what it's God working those
[1:07:42] things to a you know to a purpose for
[1:07:46] those things to come to a place that God
[1:07:47] wants us to be and you know one of the
[1:07:51] things I I was looking at was you know
[1:07:53] brother was speaking of of the the Lily
[1:07:56] and you know he was talking about this
[1:07:57] Lily being down in the ground and he
[1:07:59] said that seed was down in that mud and
[1:08:01] all of that muck and all of that stuff
[1:08:03] the dirt and all that stuff and all that
[1:08:05] filth down there in that pond down in
[1:08:07] the bottom and there's that seed and
[1:08:10] that seed but that seed is to bring
[1:08:12] forth life that seed is predestinated to
[1:08:15] do something and God created that seed
[1:08:18] not to just lay in that mud but it's to
[1:08:20] bring forth something and you know and
[1:08:22] he was speaking and in the message birth
[1:08:24] paines and he was speaking how that how
[1:08:26] that seed was down there and you know he
[1:08:28] said what what does it take what was it
[1:08:30] he said it was the light the S the light
[1:08:33] of the Sun was shining do you know that
[1:08:35] seed never could see that light it never
[1:08:39] could see the light of the Sun but you
[1:08:41] know what the warmth was there in the
[1:08:42] water those rays were there but it could
[1:08:45] never see that but you know what just
[1:08:46] the sun like shining in all of that it's
[1:08:49] like where is God in all this there's no
[1:08:52] way but you know what the sun was was
[1:08:53] shining on that seed and in all of that
[1:08:56] fil all of that mck way away from all of
[1:08:58] that and yet that that seed began to
[1:09:02] germinate and began to express itself
[1:09:04] and began to grow right out of all that
[1:09:06] mud and all of the mud and all the filth
[1:09:09] and everything that was around it but
[1:09:11] you know what it never hindered that
[1:09:13] that Lily it never hindered that seed it
[1:09:15] what it do it just kept growing because
[1:09:17] it began to express what was on the
[1:09:19] inside of it and it continued to grow
[1:09:22] and grow and grow and grow and began to
[1:09:24] express exactly what it was until one
[1:09:27] day he said that thing come right up out
[1:09:28] of the top of the water and began to
[1:09:30] bloom and began to express what was on
[1:09:32] the inside why because that bloom was
[1:09:35] always there and it had to toll and work
[1:09:38] and all the way all the way through that
[1:09:40] but you know what God had called it to
[1:09:42] do that and when it come time in the
[1:09:44] right season in the right atmosphere
[1:09:46] then it brought forth exactly what it
[1:09:47] was supposed to do it came through it
[1:09:50] what but the light was always there and
[1:09:52] the light was calling to them
[1:09:54] and so it's the same way with you and I
[1:09:55] when all of the problems and all the
[1:09:57] things that happen you know what the
[1:09:59] word is still calling you to that place
[1:10:01] whether you see it or not or whatever
[1:10:03] takes place whether they they walk away
[1:10:05] or whatever when it gets worse than what
[1:10:07] it was when it goes from bad to worse
[1:10:09] then you know what it's still God
[1:10:10] calling
[1:10:12] amen yes we don't give up we don't
[1:10:17] quit because God is the one that
[1:10:22] promised
[1:10:25] just like we have many young people and
[1:10:28] loved ones that we have we have claimed
[1:10:32] y right and wherever they go whatever
[1:10:34] they do you know what they're still
[1:10:36] claimed the the blood still applied
[1:10:40] absolutely we are still enforcing the
[1:10:43] the contract we're still enforcing the
[1:10:45] deed because it's been given to us it's
[1:10:48] ours we're entitled to it then you know
[1:10:51] what we're still making the claim am
[1:10:53] right amen and they can go do whatever
[1:10:55] they want to and and live in in the
[1:10:57] world or whatever it may be and go
[1:10:59] around and and do whatever and but you
[1:11:01] know what they can't get away from
[1:11:04] that brother why because you know what
[1:11:06] the word has been been released it has
[1:11:10] been has been put in motion it has been
[1:11:12] enforced to do
[1:11:14] that and many times you know people
[1:11:17] people wonder about things well you know
[1:11:18] what if you've seen it one time happen
[1:11:20] then you know what where where how did
[1:11:23] you get here how did I get
[1:11:27] here well you know what I didn't I
[1:11:29] didn't just wake up one morning to
[1:11:30] decide to do this right you know what
[1:11:33] there was people been praying for me my
[1:11:34] grandmother prayed a lot of prayers for
[1:11:36] me and Richard to get here and you know
[1:11:38] what it was still her
[1:11:41] prayers and I told him you know I always
[1:11:43] knew growing up you know I go out in the
[1:11:44] world and do all kinds of stuff but you
[1:11:46] know what I knew grandma was praying for
[1:11:48] us she prayed for her grandchildren she
[1:11:51] kept us under why because she knew what
[1:11:53] we knew where we were supposed to be
[1:11:56] right amen but you know what she didn't
[1:11:58] get discouraged by that well you know
[1:12:01] and you you look at the the kind of life
[1:12:03] that she lived you know when when all
[1:12:05] the things that happened and church
[1:12:07] splits and different things that
[1:12:08] happened in her life you know what she
[1:12:10] never got discouraged she never quit
[1:12:12] going to church she never got down in
[1:12:14] the mouth why because she knew where she
[1:12:16] was at she knew where she was anchored
[1:12:18] and that that anchor held no matter what
[1:12:20] took place why she was standing because
[1:12:22] she had come into the light of the word
[1:12:25] and you know what she was basking in
[1:12:27] that light and then you you know so when
[1:12:31] you get to that place you know when
[1:12:32] you've seen these things take place when
[1:12:34] all of this has taken place when you've
[1:12:36] seen the the the Miracles take place and
[1:12:39] people's lives then you know what I I
[1:12:41] don't have to worry about it I don't get
[1:12:44] I don't get well you know they quit
[1:12:45] doing they're doing this and they're
[1:12:46] doing that you know what God is still in
[1:12:49] charge he's still in control you can do
[1:12:51] what you want to but you know what if
[1:12:53] God God has called you and you're one of
[1:12:55] his you can run but you know what you're
[1:12:57] only going to be come back tired amen
[1:13:01] right you can run you can crawl you can
[1:13:04] clog your way but you know what there's
[1:13:06] coming a day you're going to have a Day
[1:13:08] of Reckoning right right because there's
[1:13:11] coming a day you're coming because
[1:13:12] you've got to come and answer the call
[1:13:15] amen amen if you're one of his he said
[1:13:18] I'm not going to lose one of
[1:13:22] you
[1:13:24] praise God it he never gets
[1:13:28] tired he just lets us do our thing spin
[1:13:31] our wheels and do all our foolishness
[1:13:34] but you know what he's never too far
[1:13:36] away he's still waiting on
[1:13:39] us see if we just get to that place
[1:13:41] where we realize God is in control and
[1:13:44] he's bringing us to that
[1:13:48] place see God is in God's word is in
[1:13:51] force and whatever ever we have God God
[1:13:55] is in his word and whatever the word
[1:13:57] says you know what that's all you have
[1:13:59] to look
[1:14:01] at see the word the word is is light
[1:14:05] amen and and the the light of the
[1:14:08] word you know when all of the things
[1:14:11] that is in the word when you come into
[1:14:14] this this Kingdom when you come into
[1:14:16] this family of God then the word is is
[1:14:18] you you become into this the light of
[1:14:21] the word but you know what then there's
[1:14:22] a Contin continuation of that light you
[1:14:25] know it's just a continuation of the of
[1:14:27] the growing and you know brother ROM was
[1:14:29] speaking in the in the church age book
[1:14:31] and and I I thought was kind of funny
[1:14:33] but being uh the Fourth of July being
[1:14:36] yesterday but you know hey brother R
[1:14:38] speaking of he was talking about the
[1:14:40] church ages and you know he was talking
[1:14:42] about how the church Ages was the the
[1:14:45] the basis for to understand the rest of
[1:14:47] the word and he was you know he was
[1:14:49] covering the church ages to understand
[1:14:51] he said because upon this we're going to
[1:14:52] build all of the other foundations the
[1:14:55] other doctrines that are in the word had
[1:14:56] to come and he was talking about that
[1:14:58] Roman candle and he said when that Roman
[1:15:00] Candle was lit and the light went out
[1:15:02] from that Roman candle and he said then
[1:15:04] the next one came and the next one came
[1:15:06] and he's like you know he said we we
[1:15:07] look at the illumination of the word and
[1:15:10] as as that Roman candle went out but you
[1:15:12] know what there's another one coming
[1:15:14] right behind it because sometimes we
[1:15:15] catch our eyes on that it's like wow
[1:15:17] look at that but you know what there's
[1:15:18] another one there too and we you know
[1:15:20] sometimes we get wow we get overwhelmed
[1:15:22] by that you know just like all of those
[1:15:24] shooting all those Fireworks off you
[1:15:26] know when you here's a beautiful blast
[1:15:28] and this you see this marvelous scene
[1:15:30] well you know what there's another one
[1:15:31] right behind it and you just continue on
[1:15:34] because God is bringing you up through
[1:15:36] the word and as as it begins to unfold
[1:15:38] and you're like wow you know you you
[1:15:40] start some days I I can still remember
[1:15:42] brother Dale preaching on Romans 8
[1:15:44] Romans chapter 8 and and I I tell
[1:15:46] everybody from him preaching on that
[1:15:48] that one time I said I never can read
[1:15:51] Romans 8 ever again the same way
[1:15:53] because I saw it one way but when he got
[1:15:55] done preaching it I said there's a
[1:15:57] there's a veil that's come off of the
[1:15:59] book and I can I'll Never See Romans 8
[1:16:02] the same way because I and I can
[1:16:03] honestly tell you I see myself there I
[1:16:06] because I understand I see something
[1:16:08] there that ties me to that why because
[1:16:11] that is what God has called us to to be
[1:16:13] the manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:16:16] word is open unto us there is therefore
[1:16:20] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:16:23] Christ Jesus why because if you
[1:16:26] understand because you know we can
[1:16:28] condemn ourselves and we can live under
[1:16:30] the condemnation of the devil but let me
[1:16:31] tell you something God don't see
[1:16:33] condemnation when it's settled and under
[1:16:35] the blood you know what there is no
[1:16:37] condemnation there is no there is no
[1:16:39] holding you down we hold ourselves down
[1:16:42] we hold ourselves back but God doesn't
[1:16:44] see that thank God he's got a sea of
[1:16:48] forgetfulness and the depths of the sea
[1:16:50] and it's all covered and it is all
[1:16:52] settled amen right right sometimes we
[1:16:55] got to get to the place where we realize
[1:16:57] that it's settled amen it's a settled
[1:17:00] inside of us what we've done in the past
[1:17:02] if God has forgiven us and he's
[1:17:04] forgotten it then you know what there is
[1:17:05] no more answering to
[1:17:08] that you know it's just like when you go
[1:17:11] to court and you have a court case and
[1:17:13] they finish that and they settle that
[1:17:14] and they stamp it it's closed it's
[1:17:16] finished you know what you can bring
[1:17:18] that back up why because there is a
[1:17:21] judgment upon that and it has
[1:17:24] finished and when you and I have had
[1:17:26] someone that's come into our the judge
[1:17:29] and the jury and our attorney has come
[1:17:31] in and has settled the case and has
[1:17:33] stamped it that it has settled and it's
[1:17:35] settled forever then you know what there
[1:17:37] is no more bringing that up right
[1:17:40] brother but many times the problem is we
[1:17:43] got to get to the place where we realize
[1:17:44] it is
[1:17:46] settled well maybe sometimes maybe the
[1:17:49] problem is is that it's not settled
[1:17:51] that's it maybe maybe we've not got to
[1:17:54] the place where it's been
[1:17:56] settled but you know what you get to the
[1:17:58] place where it's settled in God and
[1:17:59] God's going to reveal to you that it's
[1:18:01] settled right then you know what you
[1:18:03] don't have to worry about what went on
[1:18:05] in the
[1:18:06] past God's not bringing that up
[1:18:10] right but the devil will sit on your
[1:18:12] shoulder and waste your whole day
[1:18:14] talking about what what went on in the
[1:18:16] past right brother amen and you know and
[1:18:20] many times we don't realize that maybe
[1:18:23] maybe we think things are
[1:18:27] okay that's one thing I appreciate
[1:18:29] brother Wade talking
[1:18:31] about you know when when some when when
[1:18:34] he had had talk about that brother when
[1:18:36] he when he had said whatever and you
[1:18:38] know you know and if the Lord come and
[1:18:40] spoke to him and told him said listen
[1:18:42] you can make this thing right get rid of
[1:18:45] it you know you know the the how many
[1:18:48] times has the Lord told you to you know
[1:18:50] had the same thing
[1:18:53] and the Lord come and tell you hey you
[1:18:55] know it's time to say
[1:18:57] something I've called people up and
[1:18:59] apologize went and seen people and
[1:19:01] apologize like listen I just don't want
[1:19:02] I just don't want there to be any hard
[1:19:04] feelings
[1:19:06] brother I don't I don't
[1:19:09] know I thought about brother sister
[1:19:11] Harris one time and brother and sister
[1:19:12] Harris had had surgery you know she had
[1:19:14] that infection and she couldn't get rid
[1:19:16] of
[1:19:17] it and he said he said I went in there
[1:19:20] he said I went and there sister Harrison
[1:19:22] was talking to
[1:19:24] her and he said you know he said I want
[1:19:26] to make everything right he said cuz I
[1:19:27] don't know if there's something between
[1:19:29] you and I or not right sure and he said
[1:19:31] they made it right and he said you know
[1:19:33] and then they begin to pray to God that
[1:19:35] you know if there's something that
[1:19:36] that's here that's hindering that's
[1:19:38] between us is hindering her healing sure
[1:19:41] Now's the Time to let us know what we
[1:19:43] need to do but he said after they had
[1:19:44] cleared the air and brought that before
[1:19:47] God and then they then he prayed over
[1:19:49] her and they prayed then you know what
[1:19:50] that infection went away right but you
[1:19:54] know what it took it took coming to that
[1:19:56] place and realizing I'm going I I want
[1:19:58] to stay right here until we get this
[1:19:59] thing
[1:20:00] settled whatever it may
[1:20:04] be and sometimes you know it's like well
[1:20:06] I you know sometimes you might not do
[1:20:07] anything wrong sometimes it's somebody
[1:20:11] takes what you say
[1:20:14] wrong and sometime sometimes you don't
[1:20:16] mean
[1:20:17] it but sometimes it's it's what we
[1:20:20] hear and then the devil jumps on the
[1:20:22] bandwagon did you hear that did you hear
[1:20:24] that he
[1:20:27] you and he runs it in the
[1:20:30] ground and sometimes I'm sorry but
[1:20:34] sometimes we're just sorry enough to let
[1:20:36] him hit Chik all day right we we just
[1:20:40] entertain him all day and instead of
[1:20:42] kicking him off at the at the first stop
[1:20:46] exactly so we don't need any of that I'm
[1:20:49] tired of tired of you bothering me
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:57] see this is from the message there is a
[1:21:00] man they can hear they can turn on the
[1:21:02] light and brother brand speaking said he
[1:21:04] is the light the truth the light and
[1:21:07] there is no darkness in him and he
[1:21:09] scatters the darkness when he comes in
[1:21:11] because he is the word the word is the
[1:21:13] light that's right because he spoke and
[1:21:15] said let there be light that was the
[1:21:18] word that became light and he when he
[1:21:20] speaks this it's the light of that age
[1:21:23] each time he said now he is here and not
[1:21:28] in a glare but people are living in a
[1:21:31] glare but he is the Vindicated word he
[1:21:33] is absolutely the light in the time of
[1:21:36] Darkness yes sir all these false glares
[1:21:39] and things will fade away he said yes
[1:21:42] sir here he is here don't fear turn on
[1:21:45] the lights he's Pro his promis word it
[1:21:48] lives he said he that believeth in me
[1:21:50] the works that I do shall he do also
[1:21:52] then it is is the word as the father
[1:21:54] sent me so send I you right the father
[1:21:58] sent me come in me the Jesus that sends
[1:22:03] you comes in you and the works that he
[1:22:06] did then he does the same thing because
[1:22:09] why the word is made flesh in human
[1:22:12] flesh manifests itself as the light of
[1:22:14] the day there you are there it is it
[1:22:17] just is showing the way to light in the

[1:23:20] but don't worry because God is the one
[1:23:23] that's made the
[1:23:24] light all the different things
[1:23:27] that all the
[1:23:29] proclamations he said oh see God's made
[1:23:31] all these things don't worry don't it
[1:23:33] may be dark look like they're going to
[1:23:35] force us everyone see you see their
[1:23:38] Proclamation going out all these little
[1:23:40] churches and things are are got to come

[1:23:45] Council of churches you got to come in
[1:23:48] or they're going to close you up they're
[1:23:50] going to make it going to make it but
[1:23:54] now I want to hit that real hard tonight
[1:23:57] when I got I get to this time see
[1:24:00] they're going to close up you have to be
[1:24:02] one of them or not you're either in that
[1:24:05] or you can't be can't do nothing can't
[1:24:08] even buy or sell that's right you're
[1:24:10] darome to pray for the sick if you're
[1:24:12] caught ministering to any sick or any
[1:24:14] person with any spiritual thing in there
[1:24:17] you're subject to a federal law to be
[1:24:19] executed that's exactly right see you
[1:24:21] know that that's right right it's in
[1:24:23] their paper see so you cannot do it
[1:24:27] you've got to belong to the cult brother
[1:24:29] let me tell you something you better get
[1:24:31] Christ sure in your heart right now cuz
[1:24:34] there is a Time coming where you're
[1:24:36] really going to need it you're you're
[1:24:39] out then remember when that seal is put
[1:24:42] on she is there for good see so you
[1:24:46] don't don't you do it don't you believe
[1:24:50] that stuff you get right into Christ
[1:24:52] right right now the word yes sir he said
[1:24:54] vindicates the word and shows that is
[1:24:57] the light of the
[1:24:58] hour that's how we know he is the light
[1:25:01] because he is the light manifesting
[1:25:04] itself in flesh how do you know he was
[1:25:07] God's word made flesh see God's word was
[1:25:10] showing itself vindicating itself when
[1:25:12] the Messiah cometh what he'll do so when
[1:25:16] he began to express these things of what
[1:25:19] he was supposed to
[1:25:20] do the first time
[1:25:24] when everything come against it and they
[1:25:26] didn't agree with it and they didn't
[1:25:28] come the way that he they wanted him to
[1:25:30] or the way they expected him to when he
[1:25:32] came in but he kept pointing them back
[1:25:34] to the
[1:25:35] word and you know just like then they
[1:25:38] they were going to stomp it out but you
[1:25:40] know what they couldn't do it but you
[1:25:43] know they come against it they come
[1:25:46] against Jesus they come against the
[1:25:48] early Christians all them to stomp that
[1:25:51] out to try to get rid of it but they
[1:25:52] couldn't because you know what that's
[1:25:54] what was required for their day to bring
[1:25:56] them to the place that God had for them
[1:25:59] it brought them to the place that God
[1:26:02] wanted them to come to and so that's the
[1:26:05] same thing he vindicates the word why
[1:26:07] because if you don't have if you don't
[1:26:09] have any pressure and you don't have
[1:26:11] anybody coming against you how do you
[1:26:12] know that it's how do you vindicate the
[1:26:16] word you know it's just like when you
[1:26:19] know when
[1:26:21] you you know the Hebrew children and all
[1:26:24] the different ones that came you know if
[1:26:27] they didn't have to face the problems
[1:26:30] and the power of the
[1:26:32] government Daniel there having to you
[1:26:35] know you know you've got to bow
[1:26:38] down okay whatever you know he wanted to
[1:26:42] make sure everybody knew which side he
[1:26:43] was
[1:26:45] on he went right back to the window
[1:26:47] opened it up let everybody know he was
[1:26:49] praying right everybody knows which side
[1:26:52] he was
[1:26:53] on because he want he wanted to know
[1:26:55] that God was God and God was real and
[1:26:58] that's who he was serving and he wasn't
[1:26:59] going to change for
[1:27:01] anybody he had he had his place where he
[1:27:04] was standing and you know he let it he
[1:27:06] let his light shine to that whole
[1:27:08] world and the King's like well you know
[1:27:11] what Daniel you got you got to go in the
[1:27:13] lines then that's all right right you
[1:27:18] know what the the same God that created
[1:27:20] all this world is the one that created
[1:27:21] them lines
[1:27:23] and he's the one that's brought me this
[1:27:24] far and I'm not worried about
[1:27:27] it he's he's brought me all the way
[1:27:30] through and then what was it when Daniel
[1:27:33] went down in the Lion's Den those hungry
[1:27:35] Lions hadn't been eaten all hadn't eaten
[1:27:37] in all that time and he got put down
[1:27:38] there but what was it the angel of the
[1:27:41] Lord was down there with him right the
[1:27:43] angel that liked what brother R say them
[1:27:47] them lions and stuff you know they don't
[1:27:49] go around that light that scares them
[1:27:51] right man they don't like that but that
[1:27:54] light was down there in that dark
[1:27:56] dungeon and you know what he just
[1:27:58] probably went off somewhere and laid
[1:27:59] down went to sleep didn't worry about it
[1:28:03] but you know them cats wouldn't get
[1:28:04] nowhere in nearing they didn't like none
[1:28:05] of
[1:28:06] that but you know what God had protected
[1:28:09] him until the next morning you know it
[1:28:13] you know it was so amazing the Daniel
[1:28:15] probably slept okay the king probably
[1:28:16] didn't sleep too
[1:28:18] well but you know he didn't you know he
[1:28:20] had this nice plush bed and everything
[1:28:22] the the king had a hard time trying to
[1:28:24] sleep and Daniel's down there with a
[1:28:26] bunch of dead bones and rotten flesh or
[1:28:29] whatever else is down there and all the
[1:28:31] DU you know the uh stanas all the bugs
[1:28:36] and everything else is down there you
[1:28:38] know in that dungeon but you know what
[1:28:41] Daniel went right to sleep it didn't
[1:28:44] bother him one
[1:28:46] bit Lord
[1:28:49] amen see
[1:28:52] brother ra says here
[1:28:55] and and turn on the
[1:28:57] light he said when he talking about the
[1:28:59] the the seed and he was talking about
[1:29:01] the ripening of the
[1:29:04] grain he was talking
[1:29:06] about he says and from the ripening of
[1:29:08] the grain from all the way back from
[1:29:11] Luther all the way down through the age
[1:29:12] it ought to be the fullness of the
[1:29:14] Gospel now the power of God to ripen the
[1:29:17] light that's been shown through
[1:29:19] justification sanctification the
[1:29:21] Pentecost the age ought to ripen the
[1:29:23] bride tree for the coming of the Lord
[1:29:25] Jesus Christ that Christ that Christ
[1:29:28] could be manifested in his churches one
[1:29:30] person him and his wife him and his
[1:29:33] bride amen this is the hour We're living
[1:29:35] this is the light of the day walk in it
[1:29:38] be saved all the ends of the Earth he
[1:29:41] said Church glare this day was very
[1:29:43] deceiving Jesus said in Matthew 24 he
[1:29:45] said it would deceive the very elect if
[1:29:48] possible see not Luther wouldn't receive
[1:29:51] Luther couldn't deceive a Methodist a
[1:29:53] Methodist couldn't deceive a Pentecostal
[1:29:56] that's right see but what what about the
[1:29:59] bride that's what put the Pentecostals
[1:30:02] eyes out right all of the why because
[1:30:05] the light was to
[1:30:08] them but see they couldn't they couldn't
[1:30:11] walk in a further
[1:30:13] light But as God moved on as the light
[1:30:17] began to began to grow and the light
[1:30:19] Shone for that day see they put their
[1:30:22] eyes out because if they stayed back
[1:30:25] behind there in a different age then
[1:30:27] their eyes were Blinded By the Light
[1:30:30] because they couldn't move on to into
[1:30:32] this our day amen to the day that God
[1:30:35] has called them
[1:30:36] to and let's have the have the musicians
[1:30:39] come let's all stand have the musicians
[1:30:41] come and I just want to I want to finish
[1:30:43] with this this one quote here and this
[1:30:45] from the from the
[1:30:47] message brother Bram speaking here this
[1:30:49] is the message there is a man that here
[1:30:51] that can can turn on the
[1:30:53] light and brother Bram says remember in
[1:30:55] every age in time of Darkness God always
[1:30:58] had his word to divide the light from
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:01] dark he had it in the days of Luther
[1:31:04] when the Catholic church had everything
[1:31:06] he sent Luther as a Shining Light and
[1:31:08] Luther divided truth from darkness when
[1:31:10] the Lutheran got twisted up he made a
[1:31:12] John Wesley and divided light from
[1:31:14] darkness and in the days of Pentecost
[1:31:16] when the Wesley and the Methodist got
[1:31:18] all gummed up the Baptist and
[1:31:20] Presbyterian he sent the Pentecostal
[1:31:22] message to separate light from Darkness
[1:31:25] the Pentecost went right back out into
[1:31:28] the darkness again like that in their
[1:31:30] organization took their Creeds and
[1:31:32] things he said now the hour has come for
[1:31:35] this word to be Vindicated he sends the
[1:31:37] light the word made manifest like he did
[1:31:40] in the beginning sends the word and it
[1:31:42] proves itself there is a light and he
[1:31:44] always separates the same is now it's
[1:31:47] Eternal little lights in the beginning
