[0:02] let's just bow our heads in our hearts
[0:04] while they're getting the slides up Lord
[0:07] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[0:08] around your word this morning and our
[0:10] hearts are in great expectation for what
[0:12] you have for us today I pray God that
[0:15] you'll prepare us Lord to receive Lord
[0:17] and guide us through these scriptures
[0:19] Lord Jesus guide us through the day Lord
[0:21] and we ask Lord that you'll just feel
[0:22] welcome to be with us Lord make this day
[0:25] a special day we pray be with brother
[0:27] William and as he's preparing Lord and
[0:30] and uh on on the road to come here Lord
[0:34] and be with us Lord in a special way we
[0:35] ask in your name
[0:44] amen so we've been studying uh through
[0:47] the book of of Corinthians and we're
[0:51] on um chapter 2 and so just want to kind
[0:55] of continue our thought of of what Paul
[0:58] is talking about wisdom and and so last
[1:00] Sunday we were uh you know Paul said I I
[1:04] I didn't in at the beginning of this
[1:05] chapter I didn't come to you with
[1:06] enticing words but I come to you with
[1:09] the power and demonstration of the
[1:10] spirit and you know in chapter one he
[1:13] was laying out that the power of God is
[1:15] not so much um you don't get your
[1:17] identity from uh from really from
[1:21] anything other than the word of God that
[1:24] the word of God the preaching of the
[1:26] Gospel is the power of God because the
[1:28] preaching of the Gospel will we'll
[1:30] actually will'll change your and we as
[1:33] we'll see at the end of this chapter
[1:35] Paul starts talking about we let's let's
[1:37] have the mind of Christ that as the as
[1:40] the word Goes Forth it begins to change
[1:42] the way that you think and then as you
[1:45] as you the way that you think changes
[1:47] then your character changes and then the
[1:50] message identification brother Brown
[1:51] would actually say the mind of Christ
[1:53] the mind your mind is your character so
[1:56] as think about what a powerful thought
[1:58] that is that as the words going forth is
[2:01] claiming your claiming claiming your
[2:04] thinking and changing your thinking and
[2:07] then the way that you think is the way
[2:08] that you are and so your character is
[2:11] being changed by the words that you hear
[2:14] so then that makes what Paul says here
[2:16] we speak
[2:17] wisdom a lot more profound doesn't it
[2:19] that we're not just speaking words that
[2:22] come from a a seminary or from Greek
[2:26] philosophers or anything like that but
[2:27] we're actually speaking something that
[2:30] will change your life so in verse four
[2:34] just to continue on he said my speech
[2:35] and my preaching was not with enticing
[2:37] words of man's Wisdom but in
[2:39] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[2:42] that your faith should not stand in the
[2:44] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[2:48] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[2:51] that are
[2:52] perfect yet not the wisdom of this world
[2:54] nor of the princes of this world that
[2:56] come to not but we speak the wisdom of
[2:59] God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[3:03] which God ordained before the world unto
[3:05] our Glory now say now he's not talking
[3:09] about you know when you read the message
[3:12] sometimes brother Brown will refer to
[3:13] wisdom and we'll read some quotes it's
[3:15] there's there's a a a worldly
[3:17] wisdom there's wisdom that you know they
[3:20] call Street smks things how to how to
[3:22] deal with you know how to how to invest
[3:24] in stock and those kind whatever how to
[3:27] how to survive on the streets of
[3:29] Cleveland how to how to how to do but
[3:33] but this is talking about wisdom that
[3:34] can only come from from God and wisdom
[3:37] wisdom is putting the pieces together to
[3:40] know how to interact with how how it
[3:43] elevates it from off the page to how how
[3:45] to deal with situations in your life how
[3:48] to deal with people that you work with
[3:49] how to deal with your family how to how
[3:51] to raise your children that's wisdom and
[3:54] not not just no book learning but wisdom
[3:57] on what do I do and and so uh this this
[4:01] is what Paul's talking about Divine
[4:03] wisdom is god-given in Proverbs 9:10
[4:05] says the fear of the
[4:07] Lord is the beginning of the wi of
[4:10] wisdom so if you want wisdom start off
[4:13] by uh by by having a right uh regard for
[4:21] God and the knowledge of the Holy is
[4:26] understanding the knowledge of the Holy
[4:29] is understanding so brother Brown would
[4:31] say and the world is falling apart he'd
[4:32] say worldly wisdom and I put worldly in
[4:36] quote in quotes there he didn't say
[4:38] worldly but you can see if you kind of
[4:41] quantify that that's what he's talking
[4:43] about he's not talking about Godly
[4:45] wisdom he's talking about the wisdom of
[4:46] the world wisdom always takes you away
[4:48] from
[4:49] God but faith that wisdom that Paul's
[4:53] talking about brings you back to God
[4:55] right you don't know God by your own
[4:57] wisdom by your great wisdom your your
[4:59] intellectual mind you're thinking it's
[5:02] no good it's of the world it's
[5:03] foolishness to God but it pleased God
[5:06] through the foolishness of preaching his
[5:08] word to save the lost now ain't that
[5:10] what Paul's talking about the the power
[5:12] of God is the preaching of the Gospel to
[5:16] change the way that we think and to mold
[5:18] our character to be like Christ see so
[5:21] God always use something foolish and
[5:26] simple in Proverbs chapter 24 it says
[5:30] through wisdom is an house builded and
[5:32] by understanding it is established of
[5:35] course the wisest man on Earth Solomon
[5:38] built the Tabernacle and and this is
[5:40] what he's talking about that wisdom
[5:42] wisdom built that Temple that Solomon
[5:44] built and wisdom is building this
[5:47] Tabernacle that we've got represented on
[5:49] the wall back here that Christ is
[5:51] actually building like like like Peter
[5:53] would say um uh you are Lively Stones
[5:56] buil you're you're being built up a
[5:58] house and and and you're being built up
[6:00] by wisdom by Divine communication from
[6:04] God and the fifth so so what is true
[6:06] true wisdom is
[6:08] rooted in humility and the Simplicity of
[6:12] faith not intellectual pride in the
[6:16] fifth seal brother rown would say wise
[6:18] misses it far by their wisdom going
[6:21] farther from him by trying to find him
[6:23] by wisdom now don't forget that that'll
[6:26] be tape see the wise in their wisdom go
[6:29] so far
[6:30] to try to find him by their wisdom they
[6:32] miss him see if they could be big enough
[6:35] to be simple enough they can find him if
[6:38] you're big enough to get simple enough
[6:40] how simple simple enough to go look in a
[6:42] Manger simple enough to you know when
[6:44] brother R preached that the sermon
[6:46] Christ revealed Christ hidden in simp
[6:48] he's hidden in Simplicity revealed in
[6:50] the same that he's hidden in Simplicity
[6:53] something so simple that you're the wise
[6:57] people Overlook the Simplicity of the
[6:59] fact that God could guide himself in
[7:01] you that's get down so simple where God
[7:05] can Tabernacle himself behind Badger
[7:07] skins and and that wisdom of the world
[7:10] overlooks that because they're looking
[7:11] for him to be tabernacled behind stained
[7:13] glass windows and and gold and fine
[7:17] things that's so simple that God can
[7:19] come down and dwell in you now now
[7:23] there's what Paul is talking about in
[7:25] verse 7 but we speak the wisdom of God
[7:29] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[7:33] which God ordained before the world unto
[7:36] our
[7:37] Glory let's see if I can make this play
[7:40] got a little animation here now there
[7:42] there's what it's just to illustrate
[7:44] what a mystery a mystery is like it's
[7:46] something that's hidden but then it'll
[7:49] slowly be revealed and and in Colossians
[7:52] Paul tells us what this mystery this
[7:54] hidden Mystery is it was something
[7:56] hidden from the the uh
[8:00] the Old Testament Believers the Saints
[8:03] in the Old Testament the that could not
[8:06] understand that God could Tabernacle
[8:07] himself in a people in a gentile people
[8:11] but then on the day of Pentecost this
[8:13] mystery began to be revealed and it's a
[8:16] mystery because it's called a mystery
[8:18] because it's not revealed all at once
[8:21] but it's slowly slowly revealed over
[8:24] time you know even in your own life
[8:26] you're born again and but you see the
[8:29] mystery but you don't see all the
[8:31] mystery it's slowly unveiled now if if
[8:34] it's a secret nobody knows what it is
[8:35] you don't even know there is anything
[8:37] but a mystery is is behind the curtain
[8:40] and the curtain slowly pulled back so
[8:42] that you slowly begin to see more and
[8:45] more and more as it's unveiled now
[8:48] that's what Paul's talking about the
[8:49] even the the hidden wisdom it's wisdom
[8:53] that you don't know by your
[8:55] carnal understanding you can't you can't
[8:57] know by being schooled I see see what
[8:59] Paul's getting at the only way you're
[9:01] going to know this wisdom is by the Holy
[9:03] Ghost you got to have the spirit within
[9:06] you how can the point he's trying to
[9:08] make is H how can you
[9:10] know what somebody you can't know what
[9:13] another man is thinking unless you got
[9:16] unless you really to really understand
[9:18] somebody else unless you can have their
[9:21] Same Spirit how can you know the mind of
[9:24] God but we have the mind of Christ
[9:26] because we've got the same Spirit the
[9:29] same spirit because we're United by the
[9:31] spirit we we can understand these things
[9:34] so you'll never be able to understand
[9:36] these things by carnal understanding but
[9:38] it's the wisdom of God that he gives to
[9:40] us because he we're born again so what
[9:42] what's the hidden wisdom God's Eternal
[9:45] Plan of Redemption through Jesus Christ
[9:48] and the hidden wisdom is a divine
[9:50] revelation that goes beyond human
[9:52] reasoning that can't be discerned or
[9:55] understo understood by the natural man
[9:57] that Paul's talking about it it it's you
[10:00] got to have the Holy Ghost to understand
[10:02] these deep things of God brother random
[10:05] would say he'd say God's will is a
[10:09] mystery and each man has to seek out the
[10:12] will of God for his or
[10:14] herself God's mystery now there's
[10:17] something to ponder is it that that you
[10:19] actually have to seek it out for
[10:23] yourself this mystery that's slowly
[10:26] unfolding how do we find out Paul it was
[10:29] known to him he said he said he didn't
[10:31] confer with any man no Flesh and Blood
[10:35] now ain't that what Paul's talking about
[10:37] in in the first chapter you you don't
[10:39] get your identity because you went to a
[10:41] certain church or you sat under certain
[10:43] teacher or you did certain things not
[10:46] that way your identity comes from a your
[10:49] own personal revelation of the word of
[10:52] God you and God Alone just you and God
[10:56] Alone amen he didn't confer with any man
[10:59] no Flesh and Blood he went to no school
[11:01] no Seminary he had nothing to do with it
[11:05] but it was revealed to him by Jesus
[11:08] Christ who met him on the road to
[11:11] Damascus in a light like a pillar of
[11:14] fire and it called
[11:17] him now this hidden wisdom the world
[11:20] don't know nothing about it that's why
[11:21] Paul said in verse 8 he'd say which none
[11:23] of the princes of this world knew for
[11:25] had they known it they would not have
[11:26] crucified the Lord Of Glory if they knew
[11:29] what the mystery was they wouldn't have
[11:30] rejected it same thing today the the
[11:34] world rejects it and makes their
[11:36] websites and calls it fake and so many
[11:38] things because they the carnal mind just
[11:40] can't understand it you got to have the
[11:42] Holy Ghost to understand it you got to
[11:44] have the Holy Ghost to even to even know
[11:46] anything about what we're talking about
[11:48] here but as it is written I hath Not
[11:51] Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[11:53] into the heart of man the things which
[11:56] God hath prepared for them that love him
[11:57] in other words you can't understand
[11:59] there's no way to understand these
[12:01] things just by your own understanding
[12:03] but but here he says in verse 10 but God
[12:06] had revealed them unto
[12:09] us the things that seem so far away that
[12:13] you just can't you you there how can I
[12:15] understand but you can understand by the
[12:17] Holy
[12:18] Ghost for the spirit searcheth all
[12:22] things yay the Deep things of
[12:25] God so in verse 13 He says which things
[12:28] also we speak not in The Words which
[12:30] man's Wisdom teaches I've got this
[12:32] little seesaw of the it's The Head and
[12:34] the Heart not man's Wisdom which is the
[12:37] head but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[12:39] the heart now there's there's the
[12:42] difference between education that
[12:45] intellectual understanding where you can
[12:47] talk about things versus the heart which
[12:50] is the Revelation it's putting
[12:52] everything together so the picture
[12:55] unfolds and it's like uh you know how
[12:58] brother brother Dale used used to use
[12:59] that example of of if all the nuts and
[13:01] bolts fall out on the floor Revelation
[13:05] comparing it to that would be able to
[13:07] put things and say well this goes in
[13:09] this part of the car this goes here this
[13:12] goes here because Revelation can put
[13:14] things together can put the picture
[13:17] together just like how if you can see
[13:21] the picture you can see your growth you
[13:23] can see that we've got to come from a
[13:25] little baby form to maturity and you
[13:27] begin to see the picture unfold
[13:29] what what is that picture it's the
[13:31] mystery the hidden Mystery that Paul's
[13:32] talking about the mystery of his will so
[13:36] which the Holy Ghost teach us comparing
[13:38] spiritual things with spiritual what's
[13:41] that mean comparing spiritual things
[13:42] with spiritual so so that means
[13:44] spiritual truths have to be understood
[13:46] taught and evaluated in the context of
[13:48] spiritual Revelation not not not human
[13:51] reason or worldly
[13:53] viewpoints and and when you're looking
[13:55] when you're trying to understand things
[13:57] you use script scripture actually
[13:59] interpret scripture so you think you you
[14:02] think well I got you come up with your
[14:04] own idea but it's got to compare with
[14:06] scripture you take it back to scripture
[14:09] and so you're actually understanding
[14:11] something spiritual by something
[14:14] spiritual it's the Holy Ghost in you
[14:16] this is spiritual that that was that was
[14:18] birthed In You by the word and you're
[14:20] you're comparing that with the word and
[14:23] the word is actually interpreting the
[14:24] word so it's you're understanding the
[14:26] spiritual things with spiritual and and
[14:29] and then that's how you can understand
[14:32] things of life because if you're not led
[14:34] by the Holy Ghost spiritual truths are
[14:37] just foolish but because you've got the
[14:39] Holy Ghost now you can compare things
[14:42] correctly you can discern things
[14:43] correctly because the Holy Ghost gives
[14:45] you understanding the holy in other
[14:47] words the Holy Ghost enables Believers
[14:50] to measure to measure up things is is
[14:52] this right is it
[14:54] wrong what is that preacher preaching
[14:56] right is he preaching wrong and you're
[14:58] comp comparing spiritual things with
[15:00] spiritual and and then also you you look
[15:02] at it in different phases of your life
[15:05] you're going to look at things different
[15:07] when when you're a baby you won't you
[15:09] you're going to I mean we we even
[15:11] compare um we talk about how even when
[15:13] you're preaching sermons you preach that
[15:16] same sermon maybe a year later and it
[15:18] you're looking at things different and
[15:20] it will you'll be able to express things
[15:22] maybe in a higher form because of growth
[15:26] because things soon as you step down
[15:29] from the pulpit or as soon as you leave
[15:31] this church you'll today you'll be
[15:34] different than the way that you were
[15:35] when you entered and you're you're
[15:37] constantly growing and and that makes
[15:39] you look at things different than the
[15:41] way that you used to look at it so
[15:43] there's different aspects of your
[15:45] spiritual experience that are unveiling
[15:47] deeper truths over time comparing
[15:49] spiritual to spiritual but the natural
[15:52] manth I've got I've got the listening
[15:55] post here that you can see the natural
[15:56] math doesn't know how to hear the the
[15:59] natural man receiveth not the things of
[16:01] the spirit of God for they are
[16:02] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[16:05] them because they are spiritually
[16:08] discern we were talking in the car
[16:10] riding over here that uh the natural man
[16:12] just looks at the things of the message
[16:13] and all they have to see are things to
[16:15] poke at and make fun of and everything
[16:17] but a spiritual man looks at it and and
[16:19] it's like this this like the duck the
[16:21] duck craving water this is the thing
[16:23] that I've been wanting all my life this
[16:26] is this is it I found it but to the
[16:29] Natural man all he sees is something to
[16:33] to make fun of and poke
[16:35] at but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[16:40] things yet he himself is judged of no
[16:45] man now what's Paul trying to say here
[16:48] don't don't you love how every scripture
[16:50] that Paul says is just so packed full of
[16:54] meaning that you can just sit there and
[16:56] just digest it and and and ruminate on
[16:59] it and think about he that is spiritual
[17:02] judgeth all things yet he himself does
[17:05] Judge of no man now Paul's trying to say
[17:07] here that there's two there's basically
[17:09] two types of people that's what he's
[17:11] saying in in this in this chapter the
[17:13] natural
[17:14] man those who rely just on their human
[17:18] wisdom and they can't understand the
[17:20] deeper things of
[17:21] God and the spiritual man that's been
[17:25] born again of God and and now he's
[17:28] Guided by this wisdom and is able to tap
[17:31] in to this mystery and the picture is
[17:34] unfolding he's got the listening post
[17:37] and he's able to hear not just with his
[17:40] natural mind but he's able to hear God
[17:41] speaking when the preacher is preaching
[17:44] over the pulpit and he's listening and
[17:46] he's understanding cuz he got something
[17:47] on the inside that can pick up the
[17:51] receiver from that seventh
[17:53] Dimension so he's saying the explanation
[17:56] of this scripture is there's a a
[17:58] spiritual ual person can weigh and
[18:01] discern can can can judge things because
[18:04] he's got the Holy Ghost but the natural
[18:07] man can't can't fully understand or
[18:10] critique it's like somebody looking at
[18:12] your life and they just can't quite
[18:15] understand why you act the way that you
[18:17] do and why that you do the things that
[18:19] they do but you on the other end that a
[18:22] born again Christian are able your
[18:24] position by the new birth to be able to
[18:27] rightly evaluate and judge situations
[18:30] and be able to tell right from wrong
[18:32] while somebody looking at you just looks
[18:34] at you as as though you're just a
[18:36] peculiar person an oddball strange but
[18:40] you are positioned to look at things the
[18:42] right
[18:44] way like in John chapter 8 Jesus said ye
[18:47] judge after the flesh carnally he said I
[18:50] judge no man but yet if I judge my
[18:54] judgment is true for I am not alone but
[18:57] I and the father that sent me so in
[19:00] other words he's saying you're looking
[19:01] at things from a carnal standpoint but
[19:03] if I were to judge I would be able to
[19:05] judge rightly because I'm able to look
[19:08] at things from that Supernatural
[19:12] standpoint now now look at what Paul
[19:14] said saying out here and he
[19:16] says for who hath known the mind of the
[19:19] Lord that he may instruct him now I got
[19:21] a picture of just two two people arguing
[19:23] having a little discussion and and and
[19:25] and it just maybe illustrates the point
[19:28] that how is somebody how can you know
[19:30] what the other person's can you how you
[19:34] know sometimes we struggle even in like
[19:36] a marriage couples to really understand
[19:38] the husband really understand the wife
[19:41] the the wife to really understand the
[19:42] husband how how can you really
[19:45] understand one another even in a church
[19:47] situation to really understand the other
[19:50] person how and how can you really
[19:52] understand God if you just have a carnal
[19:55] understand you're not you're never going
[19:56] to be able to understand God in the same
[19:59] way that we can't really understand one
[20:01] another because there's there's a a gap
[20:05] between us but but then you take that
[20:07] Spirit if you've got the same Spirit
[20:10] then you can understand so that's why
[20:14] Paul says he says he goes on to say but
[20:16] we've got the mind of Christ you take
[20:19] somebody that's that's been born again
[20:21] by the word and they they they look at
[20:23] things totally different now because now
[20:26] they're they they they can understand
[20:28] because the spirit of God is in them so
[20:29] in other words no human being through
[20:31] their intellect alone can fully grasp
[20:33] God's thoughts or ways because God's
[20:35] wisdom is beyond human capacity to
[20:38] reason or
[20:40] teaching brother BR would say I don't
[20:42] care how intellectual you are we still
[20:45] got Canary
[20:46] brains because we're only human
[20:49] beings God is know by the spirit and by
[20:53] the Revelation by the Holy Ghost will
[20:56] never be able to understand him through
[20:59] intellectuals you might talk and have
[21:02] intellectual meetings and psychology as
[21:05] much as you want to and people will
[21:07] never know God they can't you can
[21:10] explain and say the people that cry and
[21:13] turn the turn the other cheek or just
[21:15] the oldfashioned but that's the man
[21:17] that's reflecting Christ in his life a
[21:20] man who is humble a man who will walk
[21:23] with God will act like Jesus amen
[21:30] now we're we're going to what Paul's
[21:32] closing thought is if you take on the
[21:34] mind of Christ you take on the character
[21:37] of Christ you start thinking the word is
[21:40] transforming your you're thinking the
[21:42] way it's transforming you and you're
[21:44] slowly being transformed to be like
[21:47] Jesus and this is what how brother
[21:49] brandom explains this scripture and the
[21:51] message identification he said we've got
[21:53] to take the entire Full Gospel we must
[21:56] and now being that we have identified
[21:58] ourselves as Full Gospel people let's
[22:00] mold our
[22:02] character we're invited to be molded in
[22:05] His image that we might reflect his
[22:07] presence and the works that I do shall
[22:10] you do also the life that I live so
[22:12] shall you we're invited by God to take
[22:15] him as an example and let our character
[22:17] be molded like his that then when we let
[22:22] his character be in us then we have
[22:25] become Sons by having the mind of Christ
[22:28] Christ mind which is his character your
[22:33] mind makes your character let the Mind
[22:36] Paul said of Christ this mind that was
[22:39] in Christ be in you let that mind of
[22:43] Christ be in you it molds the character
[22:47] of a Son of
[22:49] God you can meditate on that all day
[22:52] long your mind makes your character like
[22:54] in Proverbs he said eat thou not the
[22:55] bread of him that hath an evil eye
[22:57] somebody that's just out to get it
[23:00] somebody else jealousy enemity don't
[23:02] don't eat bread with that person neither
[23:04] desire thou his dainy Meats why cuz as
[23:07] he thinketh in his heart the way he
[23:09] thinks about things if he's thinking
[23:12] jealous thoughts in his mind he's going
[23:13] to act it out in his character is he's
[23:15] thinking if he's thinking good thoughts
[23:18] and thinking thinking thoughts that are
[23:20] aligned with God's word then he'll that
[23:22] will produce in his
[23:24] character as you think in your heart now
[23:28] that's something good too not your head
[23:30] but your heart as you think in your
[23:33] heart that's how you are eat and drink
[23:37] saith he to thee but his heart is not
[23:41] with thee now now you can even you can
[23:44] even see that just in the natural just
[23:46] just looking out in the world the way
[23:47] that somebody thinks about things that's
[23:50] how their character is actually
[23:52] expressed you look at some situations
[23:55] like there here's some some situations I
[23:57] just wrote down Bernie Bernie maid off
[24:00] that uh you know he he he was so greedy
[24:02] in his thoughts that he invented that
[24:05] big Ponzi scheme that if you you can go
[24:08] research it on your own time everybody
[24:11] thought that his investment scheme was
[24:13] making all this money but he was
[24:15] actually had a Ponzi scheme where the
[24:16] new investors were actually paying the
[24:18] old investors and they were wondering
[24:20] how is his investment company making $17
[24:23] billion a year but he was faking it all
[24:26] why cuz his thought his thought was it
[24:28] don't matter I'll just be greedy and
[24:31] nasty and dishonest and it expressed
[24:33] itself in his character now the same way
[24:36] as the word of God grabs a hold of a
[24:38] believer's life it begins to change your
[24:40] thinking to where you start thinking
[24:41] that all things are possible and the
[24:43] example brother R gave to thinking
[24:46] thinking right is like Martha at the
[24:47] tomb that she could have scolded and she
[24:49] could have jumped on Jesus where were
[24:51] you and all this kind of thing but
[24:53] instead she said even now even now
[24:55] whatever you say because her thinking
[24:57] was right
[24:59] and expressed in her character look at
[25:01] Adolf Hitler that was his thinking was
[25:03] wrong he wanted to uh he he he was just
[25:06] filled with hatred and and wanted to be
[25:09] you know Superior and and he had all
[25:11] these distorted beliefs and a quest for
[25:13] power and those thoughts actually
[25:16] expressed in his
[25:18] character or Elizabeth Holmes is another
[25:20] good example where she had everybody
[25:22] convinced that she made this little
[25:24] machine called The Edison machine that
[25:26] was supposed to be able to just with a
[25:27] drop of blood tell you all that was
[25:29] wrong with your blood and she deceived
[25:31] everybody and built a whole company on
[25:33] that until they found out that
[25:35] everything she said was was wrong that
[25:38] she was just a liar and a deceiver what
[25:40] was it was the thoughts so the thoughts
[25:44] will actually manifest in your character
[25:46] in the same way now that that's a
[25:49] powerful thought now that brother
[25:51] Brandon would say that if you as the
[25:53] word is is actually piled up in your
[25:56] heart you begin to believe that all
[25:58] things are possible even to where it
[26:00] actually changes the way that you speak
[26:03] that you
[26:04] believe that God can heal you of
[26:08] cancer and and not because you're trying
[26:10] to act like it or you're trying to prove
[26:15] anything but it's the word of God that
[26:19] piles up within your heart until your
[26:22] thinking changes right and you begin to
[26:25] believe amen that what God Said is true
[26:30] yes and that's why he said in the form
[26:33] and latter
[26:35] rain he said the church and all of its
[26:37] spiritual gifts and lights and so forth
[26:40] and the great signs that he's given to
[26:42] the church to look at there's the world
[26:44] out there the Fig Tree putting forth its
[26:46] buds all these other things are
[26:48] handwriting on the wall to the
[26:51] world but you see these signs
[26:54] appearing The Works that I do shall you
[26:58] also that's the character being
[27:00] expressed a little while and the world
[27:02] seeth me no more ye shall see me for
[27:05] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[27:06] of the world these signs appearing what
[27:09] is it the spirit in the church is
[27:12] becoming so close like Jesus till the
[27:15] church and the spirit will unite
[27:18] together and the resurrection will come
[27:20] what what is that how does a Rapture
[27:23] happen it's your thinking the word pile
[27:26] word upon word
[27:28] precept upon precept that's right until
[27:31] your thinking changes and as your
[27:34] thinking changes your character changes
[27:37] so that you're so close to Jesus until
[27:41] you can't tell the difference that's
[27:42] right it's God and Christ are manifested
[27:45] fully in the bride in Oneness God bless
[27:49] you the musicians can go ahead and come
[27:51] and we'll stop
[27:57] right for
[28:33] [Music]
