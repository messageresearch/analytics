TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you brother all right let's um uh greet you again in the name of the Lord if you're if you're neigh you can greet people five times but uh be prayer for us um so happy to be here uh we love this church we love your pastor um if you feel like you no longer have interest in him you can send him to us we'll be happy to have him we certainly enjoy his I'll be there so uh if you want him to retire or something like that we will happy to have him um but we we suddenly love this church and brother Bob and the different ministers uh last time I visited the church in North Carolina no not the last time the other time brother Bob was ministering and we had a wonderful time in the Lord and I thought this church is disproportionately blessed in the ministry amen so if we could stand and open Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 21 verse 42 Matthew chapter 21:32 we try not to keep you too long we believe in the message of the hour amen so we we try to keep it with within an hour Matthew chapter 21:42 the Bible says says if you have it you can say amen amen amen Jesus said unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof this is when the kingdom was been taken from the Jews and being given to the Gentiles now now the kingdom is now moving from the Gentiles and going back to the Jews so so but but the inspiration is this verse 42 he says the the stone which the builders rejected the same is the head of the corner and there is where we draw our thought this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes we may have our seats for a little time tonight we want to talk about it was the Lord's doing and for a subtitle we want to talk about the last sign amen amen so Jesus Christ here our Lord was obviously preaching to the Pharisees because they would ask him questions and there's nothing wrong with asking God a genuine question but God looks at your motive behind the question and and and here you know know he was talking to the to the Pharisees to the to to the clergy of that day and he says didn't you read that the stone which the builders rejected and obviously this scripture is talking about uh uh the builders in our context are the ministers because the ministers are the builders amen amen and the prophet preached the message uh that day on Calvary right I mean the indictment it says they the clergy crucify it says they at the most holy place they the clergy crucify by blaspheming him the word amen because the clergy or the ministers we are the builders and the prophet will say we are not building a wall we are building a building and because we are building a building there are windows there are doors there are spots that look weak but that's okay God wants his building to be like that and if you want your building to pass inspection it has to have all these different aspects you have to have evens you got to have Windows you got to have you can't have only all the strong Parts you can't just make it all by break amen so you have to build it according to the blueprint praise the Lord so here our Lord was telling these people that this was the Lord's doing and it really struck my heart that whatever was happening it was not the devil doing it amen no it was God who was actually doing that it was God who who chose things to come a certain way it was God who elected before the foundation of the world how his gospel was going to come and who was going to present it because everything was made by the word and we outside of the word was not anything made which was made so everything was made by the word for him amen that's what the Bible says in Colossians everything was made by him and for him so really that's why we we we have received this kingdom yes and and the word Kingdom means kingship and domain it's just a compound word kingdom and domain now kingdom is different from a democracy in a democracy people may decide we want this we want that that's okay but in a kingdom the kingdom the king brings the rules the king is the one who says this is what I want and usually it's not negotiable but in a democracy you can do whatever you want you can say well I choose to be a cat or I choose to be this because that's your choice but in a kingdom you don't do that they are Kingdom principles amen praise be the name of the Lord so now the Lord Jesus Christ is that stone and he's the stone that the builders rejected in the message dedication the prophet say is it was an old looking Stone yes right and the and the Builder they sort of like thought you know what let's just put it aside you know let's just put it aside because it was not a usual Stone it wasn't something so appealing it was something that was a little bit unusual and that stone is Jesus Christ and who is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the word amen when we say the word we're not just talking about a quot or a scripture the word is the full word because the word is a person now this is my hand but for me to be a person I have to have my entire being so when we say the word we mean the fullness of the word so when we say receive the word the word the word is it's not just a scripture you can have a scripture but not have the word because the devil can't cut the scripture because he CED it to Jesus hen he had the scripture but he did not have the word but the word was Christ who was the person of the word am amen so when we when we talk when we talk about the word we are talking about having the fullness of what God wants in our time amen hallelujah so sometimes when you hear ministers saying the word the word you wondering what does it mean is it like the Quran no it's not like you know like ethical books or other religions no it's Jesus Christ the word the logos John 1 verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word became flesh amen now Romans chapter 9:32 uh Paul talking about the Jews you know Romans 9 Romans 10 you know Paul talks about the Jews how you know the story of because he was burdened off about over the Jews that's right just like our Prophet was burdened for the Gentile church cuz every two Prophet every two servant will be have a burden because that's how God works God works with a burden he does not work with an obsession he works with a burden there's a difference between an obsession and a burden because a a burden is governed it's it has love it's it's it it has got you know it's not you know harassment no it's a burden praise the Lord and that's how you differentiate love and last because last is is is is something that is unsatiable it's it's it's harassing it's something that is but a burden it's it's it's governed amen now Romans says wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay a stone in I behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so he's talking about the Jews that they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone so because God is the one who said I lay a stone in Zion because remember in Matthew he said we the Bible says that it was the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes in other words it is beautiful to see it was God who did it Hallelujah it it was by design that God made things that way and here Paul is saying the Jews they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone because God said I'm going to lay the stone in Zion that's why John say blessed is he when when Jesus Christ said that John was taken and was being was killed he says blessed is he who is not offended in me because you know what God laid the stumbling block and the stumbling blocks was not to stumble his children it was not to stumble those who genuinely want to know more about God but it is to stand for those who think they are wise those who think they are prudent those who think they're knowledgeable and God deliberately hid it from the eyes of the wise but he gave it unto babies such as would learn which is you and me tonight praise the Lord this is why you find that God picked a hillbilly from the hills of Kentucky a man who did not have you know more than gr s you know education it was not by coincidence it was not by his own desire but it was the Lord's doing Others May criticize but it is marvelous in our eyes glory be to God Amen some people might might think that God was a poor engineer to bring the children of Israel through the Red Sea there was a mountain on this side there was a mountain on that side there was an Egyptian Army following behind them but it was the Lord's doing and it's beautiful in our eyes am if I was to choose I would not choose Jonah probably being as a human being I said you know Jonah is a man he's got Tantrums let's find someone who's who is more stable and more reliable someone who's more zealous that's human mind but you know what God our thoughts are not as his thoughts God's thoughts is not as our thoughts God chose a man who was running away from that commission and when God did not destroy Nineveh Jonah was angry he was sitting there angry and God sent a goat and he sent an insect and and did destroy that and he was angry because he wanted to see those people destroyed and as a human being you say why would God choose a man like that you know what that was the Lord's doing and it is beautiful in our eyes it was the Lord's doing I think about I don't know about think about myself why would God choose me I mean there are many better people out there I am the least of the least and I'm the worst of the worst I don't deserve any Grace I don't deserve to know this message of the hour I don't deserve to know the mysteries of this Bible I don't deserve to be part of the Bride why did God choose me there was nothing in me that could be desired but it was the Lord's doing it was the Lord's doing and it is beautiful before our eyes amen hallelujah and why did God give you brother way as a pastor someone might think oh can we find someone better you know what it was the Lord's doing and it is beautiful in our eyes Hallelujah that's why God gave you the wife that you have it's not a mistake it was go it was by God's design and the prophet says one of the reason why Moses was the meest man upon the Earth it was because of zipora because Z kept him in line he would be out there as a prophet people fear him that says the Lord let there be fleas and there'll be fleas but back home it was very soft good evening honey how was your day and the Bible says Moses was the meest man upon the Earth so you never know how the ways that God can use to keep you in check cuz if you had everything your way maybe you will not be here but God put Rod blocks and you know and speed bumps along the way something to slow you down your parents slows you down your teenage children they slow you down can you say amen amen someone said you're not a parent until you have teenagers so I can I can I can declare today I'm not yet a parent I have two girls but I'm not yet a parent because they're not yet teenagers amen but uh we love our teenagers now Luke chap 11: 29 and when the people were gathered were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and they shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet for as Jonah was a sign unto the nites now Jonah himself was assigned to the Levites right Jonah did not have a sign he was the sign so a prophet is a sign amen amen amen so a prophet when you see a prophet you are seeing a sign amen right we're expecting a hurricane you know what the people they see they they they they look at the satellite maps and they see the winds and they see and they say you know what there's a hurricane coming because they see the signs they see all those things but we as Believers when a prophet steps upon the sin he himself before he says anything a prophet in himself is a sign am even the Bride is a sign also you having a long hair walking on campus that's a sign having a long dress and as a right vow you are a sign to this generation that God is going to judge this generation but you are a little a small sign but a prophet is a larger sign of you know God dealing with the Earth that's why the prophet says a message and the messenger are one amen because Jonah was not only preaching but he was leaving what he was going to preach amen because the Book of Jonah is not just made of things that he said it also talks about things that he did and the things the actions that he took and whatever he did is part of the word so Jonah's life is also the word of God am because a prophet's life is also the word of God I know that's too hard for you but that's the Bible That's the Bible you said brother Aon don't tell me that just give me the Bible okay let's go to the Bible what is the Bible what is the Book of Esther you don't find the word Jehovah in the Book of Esther you don't find the word the Lord or you know Elohim in the Book of Esther but is the Bible amen so the life of Esther was it the life of Esther or was it the life of God the Bible talks about Joseph was it the life of Joseph or was it the Life of Christ right if it was just the life of Joseph then it should not be in the Bible but because it's in the Bible is the word of God because Joseph's life was the life of God that's why it became part of the Bible so if the Bible would be written to today if you are a True Believer your life would be in that Bible because the life that you have is no longer your life but it's the life of God it becomes the life of Jesus Christ and we are part of the Bible that's why the book of Acts does not have an amen because it continues to be written up to this day amen so when we talk about Martin Luther when we talk about Wesley we are not talking about the story of a man it's different from somebody trying to write a best selling New York Times or a memoir or you know what do you call it biography autography whatever they call it is different it's a book of life that's why Paul says when Christ who is our life shall appear amen because what he's saying is that Christ himself he is the very life of us and the prophet calls that scripture in the church ages that the bride she is him yeah now so it's it's it's in the prophet but does not stop with the prophet it also flows to the bride but you have to understand first that God deals with a generation through a prophet and the prophet is a sign so Jonah reading as a kind of man you may think he made a mistake he disobeyed God by going to tashes but you know what what he was doing he was declaring the word of the Lord amen when Moses married a colard girl from Ethiopia I wouldn't blame him but you see come on people thought he was making a mistake yeah why would you marry a colard girl you he was even contradicting his own Bible that he had WR the people and people would criticize Moses you're a hypocrite you are telling us we should marry from the Jews but here you are you take a girl from from Ethiopia and you bring her in the camp right right but you know what the prophet says he was a type of Christ cuz he married a gentile bride now that is not to say that we should go around and just you know no a prophet is a sign amen hallelujah when Rahab was living her life when we read the Bible today we say oh that was a beautiful type but guess what she wasn't thinking that when she was going through what she was going through when she was sold in prostitution she was wondering Lord why am I like this why do I have to go through this but in h sight in hindsight when we read about that we say Oh What a Beautiful story when people if the Bible would be written about your life people would say what a beautiful story but tonight you are wondering how am I going to pay my mortgage how am I going to pay for the gas how am I going to get my teenage to through school and keeping it in the Lord you are wondering but if somebody would read your life in Insight they'll say wow what a beautiful Christian story brother see we don't know what what what is happening but you know what by and by we shall all understand it better by and by we shall know why things happen this way we shall know why things that to go this way but just hold on my brother God knows where he's taking you to because the bride shall judge the Earth amen the bride shall judge the Earth we have to have people who judge the plumbers but you have to be a good plumber to judge a bad plumber we have to be have accountants to judge the bad CPAs that's right we we got to have good pastors to be able to judge bad pastors so God has a a position reserved for you in glory and your life is to match the reward right amen think about it if you sign for a job and they say all right we're going to pay you a 100,000 a year the job the responsibility that they give you they make sure that it's commensurate right with what they're going to pay you is that right so whatever God gives you on this Earth he has to be commensurated with the reward that he has reserved for you so if you say this is too much for me you don't know the glory that God has reserved for you and we will not have the same Glory we will not have the same Glory we will be different one from the other we are all stars but we have different Glory that's why the prophet one time was walking in the office of Oral Roberts and he was discouraged sometimes we get discouraged and said Lord I know you couldn't trust me with these things but I'm so thankful that you found a man that you could trust and God said hey buddy look up y look up I am your portion there is a great reward for you waiting for you amen amen but you know what he was almost gone like David said my feet were almost gone when I thought about when I saw the evil how you have blessed them how you have they have spread but one day I was in the temple and the Lord showed me their end when God gives you when he lifts you up and he gives you this perspective then you are able to see that yeah there's not coincidence God knows what he's doing with your life amen and never compare yourself with the next person because you know what you have different places reserved in glory if you would exchange your situ situation with your neighbor you would come back after 10 minutes and say I think I was good with with what I had amen amen hallelujah it's like when I was in Africa you know I was thinking you know what if I go to to the United States I'll have a good life I'll have a good paying job and all these things I was very excited which is good I'm still excited it's a good country amen but when I came here I also found other problems like man trying to be women and women trying to be a man and I was being faced with a different kind of problem and somebody may arue you know what was I happy when I didn't have much but I was living in a normal society you see so what what it tells you is that there's no place that we can call our home here on Earth our home is there in glory because some are dealing with the hurricane some are dealing we are all dealing with something but you know what these are all birth ples because one of these days we're going to live out of this Earth and meet our King but some people they think if this man gets voted in things will change nothing will change it will get worse and worse and worse and the prophet says even if we put Abraham Lincoln in every County that's right you can never save someone who rejects the word when a nation rejects a prophet or the Bible the Bible principles there is no politician that can save that Nation if we take Bibles out of school we take Bibles out of people and we think someone will come and save us that's a lie amen so Jonah was a sign Isaiah the prophet was a sign the Bible says in Isaiah 20:2 at the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of amamos saying go and lose the SE cloth from off thy loins and put off thy clothes and put off uh thy uh thy shoe from from thy foot and he did so walking naked Barefoot you see how God works now if this would happen in our time what would people think they thought Isaiah was insane that's why most prophets were persecuted and killed because they were considered Heretics how would someone say the Lord told me to take off my my clothes and walk naked without shoes right because it was not enough for God for God to just send Isaiah to give a word Isaiah had to leave the symbol of it because as a prophet he is a representation of God Amen so God would say I want you to cook bread but I want you to use poop to make that bread amen that's in the Bible because the Bible is the Bible amen and the Bible does not care about our feelings or political correctness God is God and God is Sovereign he does what he wants because if God is subject to ourself then he's no longer God if God is subject to our thoughts and our standard then he seases to be God God has to be higher than our thoughts and our standards for him to remain God and God has to be Sovereign in order for him to stay as God if then he's subject to what we want he's no longer God but for you to be a king you have to be Sovereign so the prophet says he is an infinite Sovereign yes that's right amen so so so so Isaiah was a sign and he was walking barefoot and walking without shoes as a sign and the Lord said like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and Barefoot 3 years for a sign and they Wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia so shall the king of of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners and the and the and the ethopians captives young and old naked and Barefoot even with their BS and covered to the shame of Egypt Isaiah was the sign and the people were supposed to see Isaiah and read the sign one time the prophet was in the west coast and the Lord said to him pick up a stone and throw it says thus says the Lord judgment is striking Alaska but being a prophet Propet he had to do the Dem he had to take the stone and throw it that's how God works so when you see so he said brother what are you why are you why are you talking about this because I want you I don't want us to miss what God has done for us in our day or just to think that you know a prophet is just like any other regular Minister out there or maybe we're trying to glorify a man no we glorify Jesus am but you know what Jesus Christ came to John and he gave him the ration and John says the Revelation that God gave me which was signified by an Angel so the Revelation could only be signified by an Angel amen amen amen he did not just receive it from thin air it was an angel that signified it to John and today there's an Angel and the word Angel there means a messenger an Earthly messenger who comes and signifies the Revelation to the church amen that's why the denominations are going in darkness because they don't have the lamp that's right they don't have the light right right because a messenger is a light to the age amen now the Bible says and aijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in 12 pieces and he said to jeroboam take the 10 pieces for thus says the Lord God of Israel behold I will Ren the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee now I'm I'm reading a lot of scripture so that you know we have got young people coming up they want to know why we are saying certain things they think having a prophet like brother Braham is just a new phenomenal no we have always had prophets and God has always dealt with the people through the prophets right amen and these signs they were always there so like this man here he tore the Garment of of Elijah of Elijah right and he says I'm going to give you 10 pieces which was representing the 10 tribes of Israel and he said I'm going to give the two other pieces to Solomon right that's when the kingdom was divided it was God who did it for his own Glory but the sign was the Garment that was Tor by the prophet amen hallelujah hosia I'm going to I'm going to skip I'm going to turn a corner from these signs but just maybe one more the Bible says in the beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea and the Lord said unto Hosea go take unto thee a wife of WS and the children of WS for the land hath committed great w departing from the Lord so God is telling Hosea the prophet go and marry someone from the brothel an ill famed woman and he was a prophet now if this would happen in our time what would people think they would go on social media yeah yeah and say we have got a man who is losing his mind yeah right right you know God says thus says the Lord go and marry a prostitute forget about all the virgins in Israel find The Prostitute marry her and have children and HOSA would go sometimes and have to take her wife from the from the brothers because she would go back to the beer house and he would go and say honey come back home because he was a sign cuz that's what God was doing to Israel he would go to Israel they come back and then after a while they go back to idolatry and that's what HOSA was doing because HOSA was supposed to show the sign amen amen amen John Chapter 13 verse1 let's read it together the Bible says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour has come had he could he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them un the end I love the love of Jesus it's unto the end and me I I I skipped to verse five and after he pour pour water into a basson and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord do thou wash my feet feet yeah he said Peter was always on the extreme at one point he says don't wash my feet and God then Jesus Christ said if I don't wash your feet you have no part in me then he go to the Other Extreme and says wash my whole body Jesus answered and said unto him what what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter amen so Jesus Christ said I was I'm going to show you an example but the way I'm going to do it I'm going to demonstrate it to you because remember the Bible says in him was light in the light was the life of man am so the word can only G bring forth light if it is manifested amen but the prophet says the first light was the spoken word amen but the light had to be manifested for us to know that this is the spoken word so Jesus was not a logos out there but he became flesh when he became flesh he was the light that was manifested so the life that we live is the manifestation of the light am it's not enough just to have spoken words and tapes and just put them on a shelf we have to manifest the life of those of that word if we are to able to touch our children and touch our neighbors if we don't display their life we are wasting our time you can call it to to them you can play it to them you can repeat it but you have to leave it and show it to them because life without being manifested is it cannot be seen by people so Jesus wanting to demonstrate how the disciples ought to treat one another he had actually to perform a demonstration of the life and he washed his disciples dirty feet he did not just cut it to them no he displayed it and he showed them and the disciples they learned more from what he lived more than what he said that's why when they saw that he's was a prayer man of prayer they became so thirsty and they said Master teach us to pray because they had seen that he was a man of prayer because the prophet says the only way you can win the world is if you become salty and when you become salty people become thirsty when people become thirsty they ask for the water but you want to give water to people who are not thirsty and they cannot be thirsty unless you are saled amen so when you live the life it makes people feel thirsty amen if you want your children to come to church with you you have to live the life before them if you want your wife to call you master you have to live the life before her amen you can't be pointing a finger and say hey don't you know know Abraham called his Sarah called his Lord his master his husband Lord it was the life that Abraham displayed that Sarah said my Lord not Lord Adonai like God lord as in interpreted as Master because he displayed aive amen and if there a song we used to sing if I be lifted up from the earth I draw all men unto myself the world is angry to see a living Christ everyone can call it everyone can throw it on WhatsApp and and and social media everyone can for the court but people are looking for a displayed life the children of Israel they could hold a lamp for 3 days but Moses said at the evening time after 3 days of walking with your lamp packing your lamp you must slay that lamp and apply the blood and when you apply the blood then you overcome death but if it's not enough to just hold the lamp and and walk with the lamp and hold the tape you must slay the tape and apply it in your life that's how you do that's how you overcome death when you apply the token you can have a horse take on the Shelf it's not going to help you you've got to take that word and apply it in your life and can I tell you something it was not Moses who applied the blood Moses was only responsible for declaring the word it was the responsibility of each father of the house to apply the token in their own house your pastor is not going to come and tell you what to watch what not to watch what to do what not to do in your own house that's your own responsibility and you're going to give an account of the atmosphere that you create in your own house am amen Amen brother and some of the problems they have got nothing to do with the ministry Moses declared slay the lamp it's your job as an individual as a mother as a father as a priest of the house to apply the blood to say honey we we can't have this in this house brother Bram told Billy po my son you if you choose this road I cannot stay with you right because there's a certain atmosphere we have to keep in this house I cannot force you to to follow this way but if you want to follow this way you're going to have to find somewhere to live that was a man who had applied blood upon his house but yet he still loved his son though he left the house he still met him he still loved him he still prayed for him he did not just give up on him he applied the blood even when he was away said Lord help my boy Lord help my boy but today we want the minister to do all the religion for us as long as as I listen to your tape you have to apply the tape don't just listen to it apply the tape the Bible says he that is an ear let him hear what the what the spirit says to the churches because everyone has ears but when the Bible says he that is an e means he that can apply because he understands what is being said and the Bible says unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he cannot understand because understanding it's a when you have a revelation it changes your life if your life is not changed it's not a revelation it's just knowledge like you can ask anyone on the streets who is Jesus they'll tell you Jesus Christ is the king but not everyone is saved because they know it from here but it's not there but when you know it by Revelation and when you know it by life then it changes your conduct it changes your speech it ch changes your your the way you treat one another it changes the way you meditate it changes your whole makeup am amen hallelujah so Jesus demonstrated life to his disciples and he says you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am and if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example amen he did not just give them a coat he showed them an example amen and sometimes why children get confused is because they don't have an example at home right Mom is saying this but she's doing this Dad is saying this but she's acting this the poppet is going this way the father is going this way the mother is going this way and the child is confused but when there is harmony amen under headship when there's Harmony when when the when the spirit and the bride say the same thing when the father and the mother they say the same thing not when the child knows well Dad may allow me to to to my dad may not allow me to do this but Mom will allow me or vice versa then you have a problem right you don't have to be the same a mom has to be a mom a dad has to be a dad but the doctrine should have Harmony Amen in him was life and the life was the light of man the light shines in darkness and darkness comprehended it amen not now the prophet says now we find that his Royal seed it travels the same Journey that Abraham did right and and the last sign that Abraham seen before the promised son came was when God was manifested in a human body amen and two angels came down so the prophet says the life of Abraham is a exactly the life of the Bride the Journey of Abraham is the Journey of the bride and he says the last sign that Abraham saw before the promised son came was God manifested In the Flesh was remember we're talking about prophets being signs right now the prophet is is showing you that we as the Gentiles this is our last sign right so the the coming of the prophet is a last sign unto Abraham is the last sign unto the Gentiles that God was manifested in a man not that the man was God no but the man was revealing God it's a very fine line amen amen not to say we worship a man no we don't right but God used the man just like God would use Isaiah God would use would use Moses but here is a last sign because God was not going to come in the body of Flesh the only time we're going to meet him is we meet him in the air when he comes in in in the Rapture but before that he comes veiled in bener skins sometimes he comes behind your pastor when his ministry but we know that in a greater measure he came through the skin of a prophet and that Prophet was the last sign that the Gentile sign Gentile word is going to is going to see amen there is no other sign that is going to come there's no other great man that is going to come out of somewhere and start revealing that the prophet finished the mystery we are preaching not uh closed Mysteries but we are preaching revealed word because the prophet revealed the word amen now when we say the prophet revealed the word it doesn't mean that he came to answer every question that we have he came to give us what we need for the Rapture the message is not there to to answer every Bible question that ever existed that's a misconception the message came to answer the questions that you have for the Rapture amen God gives you what is sufficient for your journey am if you want to drive to North Carolina and you need 30 uh uh gallons of gas God will give you that right amen because he is Jehovah J he knows what is sufficient for you am so God will meet you based on your needs so if there is something that you need for the Rapture God has provided it in the message but the message is not a a a a a a AI or like a a Wikipedia where if you just think of a random question is going to is going to answer you no God will just give you enough faith for the next step that's right Abraham was given faith for his journey Joseph was given enough faith for his journey Daniel was given enough faith for his we have the faith laying in the books to take us in the Rapture those books did not come so that we can answer every Theologian on the internet no sir that's not what it was sent for this is the children's bread it was given to feed the flock it was given to feed the children so if you are sheep then God is giving you bread amen it's not to feed the whole world it's to feed his children amen amen and he says it was in the days of Sodom that God came down and was manifested in human flesh and told what Sarah was thinking back in your heart in the tent behind him the last sign before the Gentile world was destroyed by fire it's not some great politician coming on the scene no the prophet is a sign amen Revelations 1:1 I think we spoke about this now I want you now to put your antennas up buckle up amen cuz I'm wearing this so I feel like a pilot we're going to get into some some turbulance now now the prophet says now as soon as this church the bride is draw together she is taken up and that mystery of of the seventh seal of the seventh seal the mystery of going right he saying the mystery of going say some sometimes sometimes he call it the mystery of the coming of the Lord so when he says going it's us going sometimes he says the Myster of his coming it's him coming but it's the same thing and The Jewels is called by The Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets Elijah and Moses and they come back and there is where the Pentecost is all mixed up they are looking for something to happen happen the church is done gone I like the southern English at least now you people can understand when if I'm in Africa I have to explain what this means the church is done gone I done met the Lord now he says in Revelation 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elijah calling to Israel out of the Jewish Traditions so the seventh trumpet is prophets calling people out of Jewish Traditions I want you to understand that very important right just as the seventh Angel's message called The Bride out of the Pentecostal tradition so the the seventh trumpet is a parallel of the seventh seal amen you have a prophet here one Prophet but here you have two prophets so so so the seventh SE is the coming of the Lord because remember in Thessalonians it says the Lord himself shall descend personal pronoun the Lord himself shall descend in a voice in a shout in a trumpet and the prophet says he does those three things as he's descending but it's not in in our kind of way of thinking that is you going to see the you know Jesus of Nazareth coming down with you know G sleepers no he is being revealed by the ministry of the Prophet it's the same thing when Christ reveals himself to the Jews he's not going to show up and just say hey this is me no it's going to be revealed through the ministry of Moses and the Elijah and the reason why you have got millions and millions and millions of Jews and only 144,000 believe it and receive the Holy Ghost is because it will be so unusual for the rest of them they waiting for the Messiah yes they they bombing everywhere they want to build a temple because they they think the Messiah is going to come in the temple and show up and everyone is going to say wow there's the Messiah no sir it's going to be a Ministry of two prophets and those that accept that Ministry are sealed and there the 144,000 it's the same thing again in our time is Gentiles amen when people think about the coming of the Lord the seventh see yes we shall see him face to face in the sky eventually him our Lord Jesus Christ but be before before we can go there we have to have a revelation and see him in the form of the Holy Ghost through the spoken word of Malachi 4 amen so if you understand the seven the trumpets you understand the seals if you understand Moses and Elijah you understand our Prophet it says remember Moses and Elijah is to call Israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the Real Living Sacrifice to the word so these people they're sacrificing they still believe in the old sacrifice so when Christ brings them to the atonement when when the true prophets it's not like he's taking them somewhere physical and show them no he's simply explaining to them the prophets that the C CR of Calvary was their atonement that's why the feast is called the Feast of morning right amen right let's put it on the screen amen I've got about 10 minutes left but that's okay so the Bible is based on the Harvest Right all the Jewish feast they were based on the Harvest Passover and live in bread there was some form of harvest happening so you have the spring feast and the four feasts right these four Feast that's when they harvest the grapes and prong grades and olives and we don't have time to get into that but the spring is when they harvest the grains the barley and the wheat and the different ones and the Bary was the first to ripen right and that's why you had the sh wave and everything because you could not do a fish without some Harvest because these things they represent the Harvest of Believers that's why we talk about perfection because Perfection is maturity because you can't be harvested unless you are mature amen amen can you say amen amen so first fruits or UNL bread or Passover that's why they the pass over here to consign to the ripening of the Bley that's why the seventh plug when God sent hell upon upon upon Egypt it says everything was destroyed but the B right was in the ear it wasn't destroyed because it was getting to about Harvest was soon after Passover you have unli bread and you have the shiv for you to have a shave wave you need to have the bread and you need to have the shave to wave before the Lord amen and of course the four you harest your grapes and your wine and some of it represents judgment right the wine represent different ones amen and some of it represents you know different things but we don't have time now this Feast we don't have time to go through them but the Feast of atonement it's not a killing because Christ dies once so Christ dies at the Passover at the cross right but the Jews they are CAU by the trumpets amen so that they can receive the atonement amen when they receive the atonement they enter into the Feast of Tabernacles which is the Millennium amen so when they are when the the atonement is not the killing of a lamp it's a Ministry that makes you realize hey your Passover happened back 2,000 years ago so Christ revealing him himself to Israel is the ministry of of the prophets when the prophets are preaching they are preaching the atonement so the message of the hour that's where you find your atonement when you go out of your denomination and you realize oh by the way this is the true atonement this is Jesus Christ that's how you receive your atonement it's not like the caral denominational way of thinking oh brother things are happening in Israel they're buying the ha first oh something great is happening no they will understand the true atonement and the Bible says that they will cry they will they will cry because why they realize oh it was Joseph that we sold because Joseph had to dismiss had to dismiss the bride so that he could review his himself to the brothers how did he reveal himself to the brothers he showed them the sign of circumcision and he could not do it in front of his bride he had to dismiss his bride and show his brothers I am a Jew this is my sign of circumcision and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto see the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin exposed to a man now why did God choose a virgin that was exposed not only exposed it was exposed to a man who was a weak M right and this little girl comes up and say I'm pregnant actually it was an angel that met me and got me pregnant yeah right by the way you are in courtship yeah who is your boyfriend well it's a man who's 40 years old you know his wife died okay so now you're saying you are pregnant by an Angel yeah if you are not elect you are not going to believe that that's right why did God choose such a comp licated process why didn't he just find an a virgin who was not exposed virgins they were there fasting and praying some of them children of Levites why didn't you choose that why why did did God do something that would raise questions why wasn't the prophet there when the cloud appeared why was he in Texas God does it to confound the wise amen it was the Lord's do and it is marvelous in our eyes right now it's easy for you to say ah of course of course the angel came to marry but he think about it if you were living in his time that's right right brother and a 16y old girl who just found a boyfriend who is 40 years whose wife had died say I'm pregnant an angel met me and now I'm pregnant no precedence in the Bible whatsoever except one scripture and that one scripture is enough that's right amen and by the Bible says but God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the what this is why don't be too smart for the message it will go on top of you remain simple remain humble then God can reveal it to you amen amen now God he chose Moses a man who could not speak and he says you are the mouth piece you you take a man who cannot speak and you say you're the mouthpiece and Moses said unto the Lord oh my God I am not eloquent neither therefore nor since thou spoken unto thy servant but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him who ha made men's mouth or who maketh the dump or the blind you know what Moses kept arguing with the god with the Lord until the Bible says and God's was wroth with Moses and one time God wanted to kill Moses I think twice one that time and when he didn't circumcise his children because you know what Moses thought he could correct God you cannot correct God sometimes people think they can correct God and his choices God's choice is perfect amen you look at the baboon it's beautiful perfect that's the way God made it you look at the gator that's the way God made it everything God made them made it he said this is perfect Peter tried to do it each time he correct he tried to correct the word he found himself on the wrong side when the Lord would say I'm going to be arrested and the son of man is going to be killed and Peter says oh no no no no that's not going to happen right and God Jesus Christ said get behind me Satan because he was trying to correct the word word and the Lord said all of you are going to leave me and forsake me and I'm going to be alone and Peter thought he was smarter than the word says oh no I'm not going to leave you I I even go with you to jail and the Lord looked at him and said you especially you you the C is not going to three times until you deny me why because he was trying to be more holier than the word yeah on you are trying to be more righteous than the word stay with the word amen don't add don't subtract keep it the way it is in the Bible they used to make cakes that were called meal offerings if God said put 5 tablespoons of olive oil you'll put five tablespoons of olive oil amen if you put 10 then God is going to accept it n and Paul says we have this treasure in E and vessels that the Excellence of the power may be of God and not of us God chose Ean ver vessels he did not choose titanium vessels he did not choose golden well we have some golden verses is a type but he chose Ean that's that's dirt right that's that's the Bible word for for dirt right when I was in Africa I didn't understand why the prophet would say you have six feet of dirt because we we we we use the word sand or soil or we don't use dirt because For Us dirt but when I came here understood that you know the sand is what we called so the Bible here says the treasures is in Ean vessels right it's it's like in clay clay vessels so God would take the most precious things and he put them in vessels amen and I want to tell you something as I close amen the Bible this this what we call the holy Canon these books they were not always printed like this they were written in parchments and in Scrolls and they were lost and you know how they were found some some were discovered dead under under the Dead Sea right but a lot of some of them were found in caves they were found in clay pots so God was a genius to know that you can keep something inside clay and it can last for hundreds of years but but when God Did It people thought wow it's just clay but guess what that's go where God wanted to keep his word and God has put his word in these clay vessels you know we might be weak we might be brutal we might have our bad days we might have our our moments of temper but you know what God decided to put his word behind bener skins when God told Noah to build an ark he says go and find Goa wood and Goa wood is the one of the weakest Woods you can find it's very poor us and Noah did not ask God why are you making such a poor engineering decision just obeyed God and you and I are goer wood but if you if you then peit that goer wood with peach it becomes as hard as a rock amen without the peach of the Holy Ghost AM you are just vulnerable and poorest but it's when the Holy Ghost comes and Fs those those hes that you have then you become as hard as a rock and then nothing can move you then you can sing that song Jesus Is My Savior I shall not be moved I shall not be moved amen hallelujah do you love him tonight if the musicians can come God gave us a prophet amen and the prophet was the last sign and we being Gentiles we are also the last sign unto this generation and and the prophet did not understand his life and he he didn't understand what was happening to him and one time God said and then he went to the cave to pray and he met the Angel and the angel told him your peculiar birth and your misunderstood life was to take a gift so his life was connected to his gift his his birth his life was connected to his gift so it was not just only applicable to the prophet it was is also applicable to you right there are things that you may not understand there are things that you happen to you and you say why did this happen you know what God had a purpose for that God had a gift that he wanted to manifest in these last days that gift is in you it may not be preaching it could be singing maybe that's what gave you the inspiration to sing the way you sing it could be being a good mother it could be what you went through and you say you know what because of what I went through I want to be a good mother to my children God knew exactly what he was doing yes amen amen let's stand upon our feet I'm no longer a slave to fear is that the key Brothers oh I
