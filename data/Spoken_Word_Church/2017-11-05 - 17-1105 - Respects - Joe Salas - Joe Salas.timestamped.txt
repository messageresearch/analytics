[5:38] and their sons and their little children
[5:50] this man died current death along man or
[5:54] if they be visitors after the
[5:56] dissertation of all men then the Lord
[5:58] had not sent me
[6:15] and it a professor he had made Nana
[6:18] speaking all these words at the ground
[6:22] under them they know that a taint to
[6:38] them went out alive into the pit and
[6:40] therefore closed upon them and they
[6:42] perish them from among the congregation
[6:54] there came out of a far from the Lord of
[6:57] punching the 250 men the upper instance
[7:19] last time I was talking about a kingdom
[7:21] and you're not a kingdom and unless God
[7:23] is tell you what you do so you all quit
[7:26] for me that I do today I want to talk on
[7:32] now on respect brother Wade wants us to
[7:38] do two Sundays in a row so if I hurt you
[7:41] a little bit next week I'll have a
[7:44] band-aid I'll be nice this week I mean I
[7:49] see what happens today let's go to
[7:56] Genesis chapter 4 chapter 4 we start
[8:05] with 1 verse 9 and Adam knew Eve his
[8:19] wife and she conceived and bare Cain
[8:21] instead of having gotten a man from the
[8:23] Lord and she again bare his brother Abel
[8:27] and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but
[8:29] Cain was a tiller of the ground and a
[8:31] process of time it came to pass that
[8:33] Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[8:35] an offering to the Lord in Abel he also
[8:39] brought to the first crystalline persons
[8:43] are you say that he spoke and now that
[8:46] fed there of an order and the Lord had
[8:48] respect unto Abel and to his offering
[8:51] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[8:55] not respect and Cain was very wroth and
[8:58] his contrast fell and the Lord said unto
[9:01] Cain why are the rough for the contras
[9:04] Palmer he does do it well shalt not thou
[9:11] be accepted in the booths not will same
[9:15] light at the door and unto thee shall be
[9:18] he desired so the rule over him
[9:22] and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[9:24] and he came to pass when they were in
[9:26] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[9:29] his brother and slew him and the Lord
[9:32] said unto Cain where the Abel that
[9:36] brother he said I know not am I my
[9:37] brother's keeper
[9:40] Cain had respect for God no ellipsis
[9:45] that respect means to consider consider
[9:47] worthy a high regard or to refrain from
[9:51] interfering
[9:53] [Applause]
[10:01] [Applause]
[10:07] what won't lost Walter yep from the
[10:14] beginning of time that the devil has
[10:15] been trying to divide us to divide us or
[10:18] kill us you know brother Brown said I
[10:23] said the devil and I had to fire harder
[10:26] shut because we got shootin each other
[10:30] so love what's that been used throughout
[10:36] human history for both protection and
[10:38] separation perhaps the most impressive
[10:41] one ever constructed as a Great Wall of
[10:44] China which is an amazing 13,000 mile
[10:48] 170 mile 13 knots 70 miles long every
[10:53] day
[10:53] the most famous one in modern time was
[10:56] the Berlin Wall and barely cut a city in
[10:59] half and preventing German citizens from
[11:02] travelling freely but physical walls
[11:05] aren't the only ones humans built
[11:08] because of our need to feel secure we
[11:11] sometimes direct invisible boundaries to
[11:14] keep other people from getting too close
[11:18] unforgiveness the bodies wall it means
[11:21] to keep both the one who wronged us they
[11:24] also keep us both in prison and
[11:27] self-destructive from consequences and
[11:29] bitterness well we got now the border in
[11:32] Boardwalk
[11:37] identification brother Brown said there
[11:40] is some people you just love being
[11:42] around but there are some other people
[11:44] that create an atmosphere that you just
[11:48] just stay away from Ephesians 4:11 215
[11:57] and he gave some apostles some prophets
[12:00] some evangelists some pastors and
[12:03] teachers for there for perfecting of the
[12:06] Saints for the work of the ministry per
[12:07] if they find out the body of Christ he
[12:10] will all come in the unity of the faith
[12:14] and the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[12:16] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[12:19] stature of the fullness of Christ then
[12:22] we have for be no more children tossed
[12:24] to and fro care about with every wind of
[12:27] doctrine by the sleep a Manning cunning
[12:29] correctness where they lie and wait to
[12:33] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[12:35] may grow up into him and all the things
[12:37] which is the head even Christ
[12:46] [Applause]
[12:51] and the message respect for the granite
[12:55] said the only way they do can respect
[12:57] God is to respect one another that way
[13:01] if you want somebody to say something
[13:03] good about you if you say something good
[13:06] about somebody else then they'll say
[13:08] something good about you we were to see
[13:17] my friend in Gastonia and we went to
[13:20] their church and their pastor has a nice
[13:23] spirit you know yeah you get you
[13:26] overhearing and you say well that come
[13:28] from and you say make your order I
[13:30] needed that but you know some some
[13:34] preachers a hitch of the evening just
[13:38] the way they say that you know you know
[13:41] you know it's different but some people
[13:44] hit you over the head or like sister
[13:46] Barbara or something she could preach it
[13:49] play hit your head I'm sorry Roger
[13:51] ordered me to hit you that hard you know
[13:53] I mean so we're all made different I
[13:58] talked to somebody I'm not gonna say
[14:01] their name and I talked about its best
[14:04] of us a nice spirit II said I'm gonna be
[14:07] like that not I don't think the world
[14:08] and it's answered not in a million years
[14:11] it's not gonna be like no names
[14:24] [Applause]
[14:34] well-well-well have a part to play even
[14:36] though the mom said that you have to
[14:38] teach your kids you know about Jesus you
[14:41] know so in them programmer life story
[14:45] says and look young children young folks
[14:48] I don't care what it is you always have
[14:50] respect to your mother and mother your
[14:52] father and mother I think one of the
[14:54] office things that I can hear the little
[14:56] children say it or young folk is the old
[15:00] man and the old woman listen that's not
[15:02] the older man no woman that's your daddy

[15:13] old woman that's right you hear that
[15:16] preacher state ashes to ashes dust to
[15:18] dust

[16:19] drill with a man and he gave Moses
[16:23] support his daughter and she bare him a
[16:26] son and he called his name Russia or he
[16:28] said I have been a stranger in it in a
[16:31] strange land and he came to present a
[16:33] process of time that the king of Egypt
[16:35] died and the children is really excited
[16:39] by the reason of the bondage they cried
[16:41] and they cried came up went to God by
[16:43] the reason of bondage and God heard
[16:45] their groaning and the I remember is
[16:48] covenant with Abraham and Isaac and
[16:50] Jacob and he looked up on the children
[16:52] of Israel and God had respect unto them

[19:28] that person irritative forgive to blind
[19:31] the eyes of the voice and perverted with
[19:33] the righteous men there is which
[19:36] altogether share the power I'm asleep
[19:40] and heard the man which the Lord made it
[19:43] big
[19:44] [Applause]
[19:48] and Elijah died and they bear him the
[19:51] bantha the more was invaded the land in
[19:53] it and had to come in it
[19:56] 17:13 20.3 and Elijah died they buried
[20:00] him and they banned the mall but invaded
[20:03] the man and they come in on the heat of
[20:05] the year and he can't do pastor or
[20:07] barring a man they behold they
[20:10] spider-man a man they test the man into
[20:12] the sepulchre paralyzed and when a man
[20:14] would had done and took the bones of

[20:19] his feet but her soul king of syria
[20:22] oppressed
[20:23] Israel all the days that joke also have
[20:25] and the Lord was gracious unto them and
[20:28] compassion on them and him which had
[20:32] respect unto them because that is
[20:34] covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[20:37] they would not destroy them either test
[20:40] be them from his presence
[20:49] [Applause]
[20:56] a greater than Sun is here there's no
[21:10] great one that money how can you have
[21:13] faith when you just out of respect from
[21:15] one another we're all running Christ
[21:18] Jesus there's no big man in little man
[21:20] we're all the same we're children of our
[21:24] Father and were his children so we all
[21:28] got a part to play
[21:29] I used to work for Toyota making cars
[21:33] I'm used to play ping-pong and one time
[21:36] this guy did show up ago he's there when
[21:38] you say you know I must be about my
[21:41] father's business we were speechless
[21:44] what can say he was he was telling
[21:47] people about the Lord you know what can
[21:49] you say he said influence people come to
[21:54] church and cut up and laugh talk make
[21:56] fun city or that gospel is being
[21:58] preached no reverence at all and they'll
[22:01] meet you on the street and with you
[22:03] don't expect any respect from people we
[22:06] mustn't do that but yet it shows
[22:09] Christianity dignity to at least honor
[22:11] that people say good morning brother or
[22:14] whatever you wish some of them holler
[22:15] little preacher hello
[22:18] that's so common and in repair if you
[22:21] know what it is they are not conscious
[22:23] of the presence of the God it won't
[22:25] become so common and religion it becomes
[22:28] such a love you until there's no respect
[22:31] just that it's always been and may I say
[22:35] the world we have seen the last year or
[22:39] two New Kingdom god Artie
[22:47] well if seen unless you're doing the Kim
[22:50] I got to put every born-again Christian
[22:53] into action but the thing of this we
[22:55] don't respect it to realize that it's
[22:57] tough
[22:58] we're just kind of leaders little
[23:00] curious we'd like to see little things
[23:02] that give a sensation we like to feel
[23:05] good we like to do this thing that when
[23:07] it really comes to really respect an end
[23:10] believe it with all our heart it puts us
[23:13] into action man respect you what that
[23:19] took on man respect you love you respect
[23:21] your own tenure come together because
[23:23] you remember there's lamis for the home
[23:26] not just 101 - that to be brought in
[23:29] everything that could be brought in we
[23:32] should love each other and believers to
[23:34] respect rate himself from the world
[23:37] another little bending the sign now a
[23:43] time
[23:44] now when God signs a gift to the earn
[23:45] that people respect it's always a golden
[23:48] nation of the people when they reject it
[23:50] it's always chaos for their people he
[23:53] does that every eight I'm telling you
[23:55] America that we would only expect the
[23:57] gift that God sent us and only golden
[24:00] tea we have to worry but the Russian
[24:02] astronaut and the atomic bombs and
[24:04] things yes sir
[24:06] our security is in Christ he lives our
[24:09] security
[24:16] the Empress God has ordained a certain
[24:19] thing to be done and it must be done
[24:22] that way we're not to inject our own
[24:25] ideas kingdom and we're here here to
[24:33] respect his idea and his Commandments
[24:35] I'm not gonna farm back to our sister
[24:38] but no matter what the other woman does
[24:39] God's touch of better lay here no matter
[24:42] what some other layman down in the
[24:45] bottle Gus got your paper here what to
[24:48] do we'll get it to you after a while
[24:50] perhaps what layman is to do and
[24:52] administer all of us has our play said
[24:56] we must abide and our common the pick
[25:00] shield I think that's one of the things
[25:02] that's holding this nation together
[25:04] because they always had respected the
[25:07] Jew
[25:07] that's right kill him and place the
[25:10] honor Jew God will honor you
[25:13] there's a bunch of Jews that renegades
[25:15] just look there are gentle the same way
[25:18] but the real Jew God put his name on
[25:21] that book before the foundation of the
[25:26] world and here he was murdered on in
[25:29] this time
[25:36] and God has no respected person what it
[25:38] did for heavy right he'll do it for you
[25:41] new ministry blind burn embarrassed when
[25:46] you give anything give it from your
[25:47] heart if you can't do that don't do it
[25:49] because you kids won't be respected by
[25:52] God to do it a lot of the goodness of
[25:55] your heart the Queen of the South a
[25:58] woman I have the respect enough to raise
[26:01] a child in the days when they do
[26:02] everything else and try to get rid of
[26:04] them
[26:05] God will respect them you'll hear about
[26:08] that woman that puts her in heaven this
[26:27] world's gone crazy so
[26:33] ten evade up one of the children was up
[26:37] pretty big man today I'm making now open
[26:39] you don't I don't know how she got in
[26:42] there this guy was in quantum hot
[26:51] there's put three yellow and there was
[26:53] one little one in her so we call the
[26:56] Caliph's tom to apologize because that's
[27:00] racist
[27:00] so this world does not call common sense
[27:03] brother Aaron says I'm afraid to make
[27:06] fun of myself because I might offend
[27:08] somebody
[27:12] it's world's fall apart
[27:16] Permenter cage and this man this man
[27:22] walked right up to the same partner and
[27:25] right by every guard everything else
[27:28] right into the front of the Emperor and
[27:30] the Emperor didn't want to respect God's
[27:32] servant you know that's not memories so
[27:35] he just turned his head and wouldn't
[27:36] even respect them you know what God did
[27:39] he tried to talk to him and he just kept
[27:42] his head turn and God was going to make
[27:44] this this heel and pay respect to his
[27:47] servant so he just said the thing on
[27:49] fire and skirts skirts him on a receipt
[27:53] raised him up and made him stand up now
[27:57] that bubble history ICN counselor here
[28:00] to respect his servant he made him stand
[28:02] up and even scores to see where he was
[28:05] sitting far went to a part of course the
[28:08] bottom receiving he had
[28:09] from Tampa from there God has a way of
[28:13] doing things you know my joy first I
[28:15] have to go pretty far everything the
[28:20] uncertain sound now the person has got
[28:22] it but a given that he's called down by
[28:26] the scripture and they fly who said it
[28:28] it shows it wasn't a gift from God
[28:30] because any Africa will respect the
[28:33] world
[28:46] because I explained we can't have faith
[28:49] when one time to pay respect and honor
[28:52] to one another see we can't do that we
[28:55] can't have faithfully have got to honor
[28:58] I'm believing my brothers sure is love
[29:01] but they respect and then if he goes to
[29:04] God respect you cannot have respect
[29:21] until you have fear you got to have fear
[29:23] of God Solomon said also in the pro
[29:26] mores proper that the fear of the God is
[29:29] beginning of wisdom
[29:31] they don't mean that you are afraid of
[29:33] him but they mean that you're giving in
[29:36] respect and rarely and when you respect
[29:38] God you fear God
[29:40] you fear that you might displease him in
[29:42] some way your fear list you will do
[29:44] something wrong
[29:46] before you can have respect you got to
[29:48] have fear and God demands it he demands
[29:51] respect
[29:52] cutters he demands it and fear brings it
[29:55] and we know that fear brings respect God
[29:58] the man respects from a service a
[30:00] service now we know that they were a
[30:04] servant because it many Pastis service
[30:08] bodies work they take the service and
[30:10] makes them servants of God and prove
[30:12] that they are sober by making his work
[30:15] work through them servant and if you
[30:18] respect that sermon you respect God so
[30:21] when I respect you and you respect me
[30:23] and we respect each other then we
[30:26] respect in God but I want to bring
[30:29] another thing through your members if
[30:31] you if God sent a messenger and better
[30:34] educated by the sign that he was
[30:36] messenger sent from God and stuff to
[30:39] them to obey this messenger exactly they
[30:42] must obey the messenger and I have
[30:44] respect to that messenger
[30:47] you can't disrespect God you've got to
[30:50] respect God if you don't believe it just
[30:53] keep still keep away from either either
[30:56] do that or come rather and inspect it
[30:59] don't make fun of other people I guess
[31:03] when they're worshipping God
[31:12] [Applause]
[31:41] he said you can't respect the man of
[31:44] respect to alpha Z holes in God
[31:47] that's the circular right see respecting
[31:50] then Minister comes up your pastor
[31:53] always respect him I heard a
[31:55] congregation talk about the pastor how
[31:58] they just talk about him run him down we
[32:01] do it how does that pastor ever going to
[32:04] do anything for you you can't do it I
[32:06] don't say this church but I mean
[32:08] churches I've seen that give you you've
[32:11] got to love your pastor you got to know
[32:13] that he's a human being but yet God has
[32:16] made him his pastor the Holy Ghost that
[32:19] made him overseer and you got to respect
[32:22] him in a manner and no matter what the
[32:25] pastor's done if you respect him your
[32:28] heart as God's servant God will respect
[32:32] you for doing it
[32:33] that's pretty good we got to keep that
[32:37] in mind it's easy to do here
[32:54] it's below equations for 4:30
[33:01] [Applause]
[33:22] [Applause]
[33:39] Jesus 438 says they grieve not the Holy
[33:42] Spirit of God were we or steel unto the
[33:45] day of redemption that all the
[33:48] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[33:50] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[33:52] from you with all malice and be kind to
[33:55] one another
[33:56] Jeremy tender-hearted forgiving one
[33:58] another even as God for Christ's sake
[34:02] hath forgiven you and all the little
[34:05] bending now do we sometimes read the
[34:10] holy spirit by talking bad about each
[34:12] other and that is coming for for a
[34:17] perfect bride not for one that's got
[34:19] them agreements in with each other yes
[34:22] now do we do we get angry do we get
[34:35] angry yes we do get angry yes we're
[34:43] convinced our anger is justified is
[34:45] watching we're entitled to it is good to
[34:48] be angry even here's a partner that you
[34:52] did long anger is universal I bet you're
[34:58] thinking but God and God was angry too
[35:01] late
[35:02] that's gotta get angry yes yes he does
[35:09] but you know what he can be trusted with
[35:11] it because he sent us we're not is the
[35:17] Creator we're not this he's the ultimate
[35:19] judge and we are there are certain
[35:21] things that are his problems along
[35:23] because of his perfection Christians 426
[35:30] a particular scripture that many had
[35:32] committed to memory when you're angry do
[35:35] not sin and make sure to stop being
[35:37] angry before they in
[35:40] day to get James my silly did James j1
[36:09] 19 to 21 wherefore my beloved brother
[36:17] that every man be swift to hear slow to
[36:21] speak slow to read for the wrath of man
[36:25] worketh not the righteousness of God
[36:27] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[36:30] superfluity not thickness and we see
[36:35] with meekness the engraved work which is
[36:37] able to save your soul brother Joe green
[36:42] does this all the time I said something
[36:50] just about the painting though
