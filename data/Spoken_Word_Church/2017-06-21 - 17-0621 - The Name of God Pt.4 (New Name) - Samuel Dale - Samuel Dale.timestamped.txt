[4:13] to the Sardis Turk aids and unto the
[4:17] Angel of the church in Sardis write
[4:18] these things says he that hath the seven
[4:22] spirits of God in the seven stars I know
[4:25] thy works that thou has a name that they
[4:29] live us and our dead okay now back here
[4:31] they had tonight not back in the
[4:35] Pergamon they had the name now the
[4:38] prophet said they had the name in this
[4:40] age this age it stayed
[4:42] come down to the fourth the fifth page
[4:44] he said their loss tonight all right so
[4:48] then we pick on up going over to the
[4:50] verse 8 and I know thy works and behold
[4:55] I have set before thee an open door is
[4:59] the revelation of the deity of Jesus
[5:00] Christ right no man has can shut it for
[5:05] thou has a little strength and has kept
[5:07] my word and has not denied my name so it
[5:10] begins to be able to come back all right
[5:14] the name is coming back into being all
[5:17] right now we go to 312 to pick up a
[5:21] thought for tonight to him that
[5:24] overcometh will i make a pillar in the
[5:26] temple of my god and he shall go to more
[5:28] out and I will write upon him the name
[5:30] of my god and the name of the city of my
[5:35] god which is New Jerusalem which cometh
[5:39] down out of heaven from my god and I'll
[5:43] write upon him my new name
[5:46] I brought around him when we get to it
[5:48] you see I write upon him the name of my
[5:50] god he said that's Jesus the name of the
[5:53] city of my god that's Jesus
[5:56] which is a New Jerusalem coming down out
[5:58] of heaven I'll write upon him my new
[6:01] name
[6:01] so we'll get to those things and try to
[6:03] coverage you may be seated
[6:05] the Lord of it is blessing now if you
[6:08] want to have some questions that's
[6:09] reading I want to start a little early
[6:11] to try to conclude this about the name
[6:15] of God this would be the fourth message
[6:17] and trying to cover it and I want to try
[6:22] to finish it up if we can if you have
[6:25] any questions feel free to ask and do
[6:28] now don't get all blowed out and run up
[6:31] and start trying to figure everything
[6:33] out brother Dale is not out here going
[6:35] to tell you no no new name of God all
[6:39] right
[6:40] I've said it Sunday you know and I'm
[6:44] saying it again until the name of Jesus
[6:48] comes to an end in the basis of His
[6:52] redemptive plan then his name will
[6:56] remain Jesus right after we going to
[7:02] rapture he will go to Israel as Jesus
[7:09] then you find him throughout the Book of
[7:12] Revelations after then as known in still
[7:15] as the name of Jesus so we're not trying
[7:18] to figure out some new name but we're
[7:20] trying to put out all the information
[7:22] that's what I want to do I've done this
[7:24] before put out all the information I can
[7:27] and then leave it to death but now the
[7:31] face run through what we've been talking
[7:33] about we talked about the name of God
[7:37] all right now I think over these things
[7:42] and thinking about it today a lot and
[7:46] when you say the name of God now over
[7:51] here in this Baptist Church if you got
[7:54] up there and you said the name of God he
[7:56] said well the name of God is God you
[7:59] know all right that would that would be
[8:02] the way they say it the name of God is
[8:04] God all right now what do you think
[8:07] though when you say that the only name
[8:10] God ever had is Jesus can you accept
[8:16] that Rd have to have some other way of
[8:21] working it down to bring it to Jesus and
[8:25] then let it be that the earthly part
[8:28] announces it you know or whatever
[8:31] just remember Gabriel come and spoke the
[8:36] nine first to Mary all right where'd he
[8:39] come from
[8:40] he didn't come from Earth he came from
[8:43] glory to announce that name
[8:46] all right now I've tried my best to get
[8:49] you to look at it over and over to think
[8:52] about it but I know these human brains I
[8:54] know I have one it don't work too good
[8:57] but I have one if they ever have a brain
[9:01] transplant I'm gonna be the first one to
[9:03] put down for it you know I want a brain
[9:06] transplant because this one's wore out
[9:09] looking but now I don't want I wanted to
[9:12] make sure that they got the little cards
[9:14] you stick in your your telephone you
[9:17] know and every what it does you know it
[9:19] captures or your computer and it
[9:21] captures all the information and on that
[9:24] little card and then you can put I just
[9:26] want to make sure if they give me a new
[9:28] brain I want it to be workable material
[9:30] but to plug in what has been made known
[9:33] to them all right because that's the way
[9:36] I want it all right but now see we say
[9:42] I'm as honest as can be now trying to
[9:45] get you to think there was a time we
[9:49] read when we're back in organized
[9:51] religion and he making a few years ago
[9:53] or something we read it where he said
[9:56] Jesus Messiah I come in my father's name
[10:00] what we thought they were three of them
[10:03] and one sent the other one in his name
[10:07] see we think it's like that I'd say now
[10:10] brother Colley I'm going to send you
[10:12] down in my name see we think that's what
[10:16] was being done but just remembered
[10:18] they're just one true and living God and
[10:20] remember now
[10:23] then being just one true and living God
[10:28] then if Jesus wasn't God were you and I
[10:33] had uh huh and she being one true and
[10:37] living God then he didn't send a second
[10:40] person he didn't send the Holy Ghost
[10:44] down he didn't send another person we
[10:48] believe the message right what'd he do
[10:50] he who he who Almighty God came himself
[10:59] right all right
[11:02] Almighty God came himself so it's not
[11:04] sending somebody else in the name it's
[11:07] bringing a name forth jesus said if
[11:11] you've seen me you've seen the father
[11:14] but there was a time we thought that was
[11:16] a second person
[11:18] right he did when he said I come in my
[11:23] father's name well you know he's here
[11:26] and we never had any talks until we
[11:32] heard of this message now be honest with
[11:35] me I try to be with you and try to lay
[11:38] out things in it the best honestly I can
[11:40] and I know I'm accused of being deep and
[11:43] Sadie but I don't see anything that's
[11:45] deep about it to talk about the name of
[11:48] God I just don't understand that I know
[11:50] one thing we will read some things in
[11:54] the met with retirin said you over the
[11:55] old Jesus and you he said if you don't
[11:58] get a direct revelation from God of that
[12:04] you don't have it see then the reason I
[12:10] read about the thing we've been through
[12:13] it we know the name of God was in for
[12:16] ages look to the fourth age when the
[12:21] fifth age came into being he says you
[12:24] got a name that you're living but you
[12:26] did but running said the name was lost
[12:31] in the dark ages now we've been over
[12:36] that and over that
[12:37] understand was it the name of Jesus Jes
[12:42] us that they just got where they
[12:45] couldn't pronounce it anymore or was it
[12:49] the revelation of the supreme deity of
[12:52] knowing who that is now which one is it
[12:57] is it letters on a page that we can
[12:59] quote Jes you that or is it a revelation
[13:02] within our heart of who that person
[13:05] really is and that person I'm going
[13:09] about to Almighty God see we've got it
[13:14] all in our mind and we still it's hard
[13:16] to fathom and bring it down see we would
[13:20] all say in our older day God is the
[13:22] spirit who taught us the spirit he's
[13:25] just the spirit is floating around well
[13:28] we've come to the message and heard the
[13:30] prophets say God is not like the wind I
[13:34] got these laying in the desk in there if
[13:36] you want to be bent over over and over
[13:38] he said he's not like the winds that God
[13:41] is a being he said he's not just a myth
[13:45] or a thought
[13:47] he's a being he's a person well you know
[13:50] what he always was that
[13:53] do we think before the world ever begun
[13:56] and back in his mind or something way
[13:58] back over there somewhere that he was
[13:59] just floating around us no we're going
[14:03] to get to this the Lord willing start
[14:06] Sunday and pick up a little bit
[14:08] weights kind of moving into the realm of
[14:10] redemption of mankind on the Godhead I'm
[14:13] just going plain go back into the very
[14:16] who is God you know and start from there
[14:23] this is the background for service is a
[14:26] background to preach on who is God are
[14:30] the Godhead you know or the you know to
[14:35] understand Almighty God and see then the
[14:39] the greatest point is to see that his
[14:41] name is Jesus
[14:46] now you know yourself come on be honest
[14:50] you know yourself twenty-eight thirty
[14:53] forty years ago on back or something or
[14:55] some of the new ones coming in there was
[14:58] a time when somebody said to you and
[15:01] they said well Jesus is the name of God
[15:03] well he's one of the three well did the
[15:09] other two how nice
[15:12] well that was God yeah it's his name of
[15:20] God I don't understand you he you know
[15:24] well we know that the word God this
[15:26] means object of worship but does that
[15:29] solve the problem remember he created
[15:35] angels they worshipped him that's the
[15:38] first thing they created that made him
[15:41] God so you didn't have to wait till he
[15:42] come down to mankind to be God because
[15:45] that was running into self-existing
[15:47] we'll get back on these things but I
[15:49] want you to go with me and I don't this
[15:52] that it wasn't the name j esus that was
[15:58] lost in the ages it was the Word of God
[16:04] eating away by that cankerworm pong worm
[16:07] locust caterpillar till it ate it down
[16:11] until they didn't they were believing in
[16:15] a trinity become out believing in the
[16:21] trinity well then there's no way that
[16:24] could be true well yet we believed it
[16:30] right come on let your mind float back
[16:35] to where you come from and think about
[16:39] what you used to think about God and
[16:43] compare it with the way you think now
[16:48] what you thought you saw was God in
[16:51] three persons yeah he was one of the
[16:53] three the father said the Holy Ghost
[16:58] down you know the profits that he came
[17:03] himself then who was that that walked
[17:07] the short of Galilee who was it
[17:11] Almighty God himself that was when it
[17:18] began to be picking up to understand
[17:21] that you could bring the name of God
[17:25] because you say something to a
[17:27] theologian wages not slap your jobs well
[17:31] you're trying to find a name for God
[17:33] much holy and you know we can't do that
[17:39] but listen church what was his name
[17:46] before the world ever begun well we
[17:48] don't know that then you don't know what
[17:55] your prophet has said got a thing wait
[18:01] to hit the corner nothing about old
[18:03] daddy coming along saying not your
[18:05] prophet you know I like to say it like
[18:08] that you claim brother round them to be
[18:10] a prophet why don't you believe me
[18:15] why don't you say what he says instead
[18:18] of saying what you think he said why
[18:23] don't you say what he says about it
[18:24] instead of what you think it says
[18:27] it's your prophet see then knowing it
[18:38] was not the name Jesus that was lost
[18:42] well you ain't quoting what you probably
[18:44] said cause prophet said his night lost
[18:49] yeah you know got it laying here I'll
[18:52] read it minute he said we come out of
[18:55] calling him a Trinity and that's true
[19:00] see how we got born again because
[19:05] without a revelation from God we're
[19:08] still just as much Trinitarian as we
[19:10] ever was
[19:12] not now see then as I said in the ages
[19:21] you see the word eat away to were when
[19:26] it came out they were calling him Jesus
[19:28] the Lutheran's called him Jesus the
[19:36] people the catholics called him Jesus
[19:41] but to them he was the second person
[19:46] it didn't matter what the name you talk
[19:49] about when you get it narrowed down to
[19:52] you see there's only one God then you
[19:56] will realize right the end and dark you
[19:58] say oh I've always seen that I won't say
[20:01] it again when it comes to a revelation
[20:04] to you that there is just one God you
[20:09] will know they can't be three names
[20:15] brother Branham said we don't baptize
[20:18] Jehovah Jireh jehova rapha jehova ISKCON
[20:22] you he said we don't baptize Lord Jesus
[20:26] Christ you say yeah but you shouldn't
[20:33] read that to me for you you're feeling
[20:35] me up okay fine Savior soul ain't
[20:38] worried about your body forget it when
[20:43] God reveals himself to you and I will
[20:46] see that just one heart you say oh yeah
[20:51] but but okay how come the people of this
[20:53] message now come and come up with a to
[20:59] Lourdes how come they come up with Jesus
[21:05] not being God till the River Jordan and
[21:08] then you tell me they believe in one God
[21:15] exceeding that's that's worth it it
[21:18] falls back on me as two people to think
[21:21] I'm just a smart aleck arrogant hateful
[21:24] person I'll tell you one thing for sure
[21:29] on Elmo smart aleck I am an arrogant
[21:32] hateful person I'm a mean old duty with
[21:36] what y'all call him
[21:38] granddaddy I want you to show me in the
[21:43] word for the trial let's don't argue
[21:50] philosophies kill me were that I'm off
[21:55] the word well you don't believe it's on
[21:59] so is so and so true is it in the Word
[22:04] of God let me ask you a simple question
[22:11] before we start
[22:17] but Ryland said that when Jesus overcame
[22:22] if he received in unite
[22:31] when I show me what right around them
[22:34] ever pronounced it if you ever
[22:39] pronouncing unite is there anywhere to
[22:43] message you they've been around longer
[22:44] as anywhere in the message that he ever
[22:46] said his name is Joe Jim Charlie R
[22:49] Melchizedek or Y always or anything if
[22:54] he knew that name what any pronouncing
[22:59] so we're looking for a name when we were
[23:01] to be looking for a revelation the
[23:05] revelation of the name is what I'm
[23:07] trying to find blue so then we know for
[23:16] a certainty that God's name is Jesus
[23:22] heaven declares it earth pronounced it
[23:27] right Gabriel from heaven brought the
[23:35] name mankind pronounced it baby leaped
[23:39] in the wound of the mother from the
[23:41] first time a human being announced that
[23:44] name or pronounced it the name of Jesus
[23:52] but see the only name that God ever had
[24:00] was Jesus I gave you that such on
[24:03] paragraph 187 84 of the adoption series
[24:07] 1960 the holy man God ever had was Jesus
[24:13] well now that but you need to go back
[24:16] before the world go go back for the
[24:18] world and we don't know what it is
[24:20] prophet went back your prophet went back
[24:30] before the world in the gods mind am i
[24:34] quoting him and told us what was back
[24:41] before the world
[24:47] and cold as God as a being sure he's a
[24:55] spiritual being sure God is a spirit but
[25:00] he is not a spirit like floating around
[25:03] remember what your prophet said he says
[25:06] he's not even omnipresent because he's a
[25:09] being he said in the way he only way he
[25:14] can be on the president is to be
[25:16] omniscient to know all things then he
[25:19] can be omnipresent but he said without
[25:22] that he's not omnipresent why would
[25:25] cause you to be just remember - you will
[25:31] one of these days don't own you they
[25:33] wouldn't come in the garden God was
[25:36] hunting Adam you think he didn't know
[25:40] where he was at what was going on might
[25:46] I ask you a question
[25:48] let's see if you believe with God's Word
[25:50] I thought our sins was to be put in the
[25:54] sea of forgetfulness you mean God can't
[25:59] remember him no because he said he would
[26:08] not he can't remember him well I'd order
[26:14] to leave it to where that maybe God
[26:16] sometimes does a little bit different
[26:19] the way we do or think okay this some
[26:23] point okay God's name is Jesus Christ
[26:29] hey we went through that nona 9 God ever
[26:34] had was Jesus so what was his name
[26:36] before the world Jesus he's all know
[26:42] that kiss Redeemer well then show me
[26:44] some other night serious
[26:51] I was a problem but now let's get
[26:56] through these in a hurry well let's go
[26:59] ahead and start reading where we had
[27:00] left off
[27:01] well how did he's the jehovah the old is
[27:05] jesus as a new now we know all and we
[27:11] went to it over and over telling himself
[27:16] existing Java father with his family but
[27:21] none of those attributes by themselves
[27:26] can be the name of God that's what I
[27:31] couldn't pronounce it but Jesus that
[27:37] very name is the name of Almighty God
[27:40] and contains ever attribute show me what
[27:51] attributes not included in the 90s he
[27:56] won't work
[27:57] alright let's read a little bit now so I
[28:01] can get through I will fidon't off cut
[28:03] it off on far I won't make you stay past
[28:05] midnight go ahead and number one let's
[28:08] start I want to read this one because
[28:11] this was basically maybe not the first
[28:14] time he mentioned it but it's when he
[28:18] connects it to his message what the
[28:24] message the message of grace and you
[28:27] know what he's talking about I looked
[28:28] again in the art was growing taller and
[28:30] taller three rainbows brother Brennan
[28:36] was out squirrel hunting and there he
[28:38] saw three rainbows going up coming out
[28:41] and he sit and watch him in a minute
[28:43] he said it was moving he said it was
[28:46] alive the three rainbows and watch what
[28:52] he comes on down see missing like a fog
[28:54] moving around I stood still for a few
[28:56] moments it was coming right out of the
[28:58] top of the little mountain watching
[29:01] every what it was it was what it was was
[29:04] a lot
[29:06] it was moving in making its motions
[29:10] three rainbows is what he saw
[29:13] right instead they're just as it was
[29:18] graying dawn I turned and looked again
[29:21] and I screamed out oh god what would you
[29:23] have your servant numb just then the
[29:26] Spirit of the Lord came in and said
[29:30] Jesus of the New Testament is your holy
[29:33] old now you know I'm to hurt you forgive
[29:43] me for being dirty but they don't
[29:45] forgive me being plain got a moonbeam
[29:47] flying we show we always understood he
[29:50] was Jesus we always understood he with
[29:52] God now your prophet said one day he
[29:57] said I used to think Jesus loved me and
[30:01] God hated me now he was a prophet he is
[30:07] honest but about you and me what about
[30:12] honey look what he said Jesus of the New
[30:15] Testament is your over the old he only
[30:22] changed his mass from spirit to man he
[30:26] was confirming of course my message of
[30:31] him and he loved that head he thought a
[30:36] lot of that experience to confirm
[30:40] establish strengthen settle him in the
[30:45] understanding of one true and living God
[30:48] and he said it was a confirming of his
[30:51] message let me know surely 31 years
[30:54] hasn't didn't money but he said there
[30:58] jeho do is Jesus of the new so that
[31:05] means Hebrews 13:8 is correct we women
[31:12] if you hold the old is Jesus is you now
[31:15] hold the old is differ from Jesus anew
[31:17] Hebrews 13:8 not in ride Hebrews 13:8
[31:24] said he's the same yesterday today and
[31:25] forever and remember what are we going
[31:30] that they're just one Lord his nothing
[31:32] is just one alright so now let's just
[31:38] read a few things so go ahead and number
[31:41] two let your light so shine before men a
[31:47] lot of this he's referring back to the
[31:50] rainbow so he's not it's different I
[31:53] just cut it or he wouldn't read some it
[31:55] said Jesus of the New Testament if
[31:57] you're over the old he's just changed is
[32:00] available well I said studying that I
[32:04] find out that same word where he changes
[32:07] his countenance in degree did mean
[32:10] changing his mask not exactly his veil
[32:13] but his mask he come to the place he was
[32:17] transformed he will that means he
[32:22] changed his way he was God Jehovah and
[32:26] God Jehovah changed himself from spirit
[32:29] become a man he's the same Jehovah God
[32:32] which that was the father and this is
[32:35] the son being the same person and not
[32:42] three persons to God come on let me
[32:46] quote right around him he's not the
[32:47] second person he's not even the first
[32:52] person he said he is the person to see
[32:56] if he was the first person that would
[32:58] mean as other persons but when he said
[33:01] he is the person that solves the problem
[33:06] now trying to establish within our
[33:10] thinking the name of God is Jesus that's
[33:19] got to be revealed it just not Jes
[33:22] letters on the package
[33:25] we called him Jesus thought he was the
[33:28] second or third person of the Trinity
[33:30] come on be honest with yourself you know
[33:35] good to lie to me and say I never did
[33:37] believe that that's what we all come
[33:43] from until the Prophet brought the
[33:46] message go ahead number three sirs we
[33:50] would see Jesus saying yesterday now
[33:55] here was we find that the Hebrew writer
[33:56] is Paul saying Jesus Christ the same
[33:59] yesterday and you know it's residence
[34:01] yesterday to Denver
[34:02] speaking to the Hebrews and we all know
[34:05] that your over the Old Testament was
[34:06] Jesus of the new and it's the same Holy
[34:09] Spirit of today over the old is Jesus
[34:14] with you but your same Holy Spirit which
[34:17] is here today are you with me it's just
[34:23] the same God just manifested in three
[34:25] different offices and so the same God
[34:27] all that God was he poured into Christ
[34:29] on the cross who was he poured into the
[34:32] church see you can find quickly what he
[34:35] is the same yesterday today and forever
[34:38] okay okay look at number four the
[34:45] unveiling of God
[34:46] these are 1964 we noticed your holy Old
[34:51] Testament is Jesus of the new sea and
[34:53] he's the same God just changing this
[34:55] form now someone said the other day a
[34:59] Baptist minister Alan to see how can you
[35:02] say that Jesus and God would be the same
[35:04] person I said well it's pretty easy if
[35:07] you'll just let your own thinking get
[35:08] away and think the Bible terms of it
[35:11] they are the self same person I'm
[35:13] excused self plain being God is a spirit
[35:16] Jesus is the body that he was veiled in
[35:18] now see you cannot separate right there
[35:22] you don't separate now and you're going
[35:26] to say God is this in the flesh is this
[35:36] we've got to live since we know what
[35:39] happened we'll cover those things when
[35:43] that little baby was born but around
[35:44] said soul of God was in that baby Spirit
[35:47] of God was in that baby
[35:50] because that baby was Almighty God
[35:56] called us on then I take you back for
[36:00] quite a while back mister is your thing
[36:03] then when I was asking about the son of
[36:05] God and Son of Man
[36:07] remember the Son of God was a low gosh
[36:10] wage just read it over and over son of
[36:12] God is the low gods that came out of God
[36:14] in the beginning they were looking at
[36:18] some flesh and tries whole he's just
[36:20] flesh Jesus was just flash when he
[36:28] resurrected and ascended was not his
[36:36] body eternal you agree so then that body
[36:43] was Almighty God look it in my home to
[36:52] my wife I'm her husband and have a young
[36:54] daughter Rebecca and her father and have
[36:56] a grandson his name is Paul named
[36:58] grandfather
[36:59] I'm loving father and grandfather are
[37:02] get all these three persons we talk
[37:05] about a lot three persons is the same
[37:09] person
[37:10] see that's God Father Son and Holy Ghost
[37:12] it's just the dispensation claims God is
[37:16] same the same God so Joe hold yo is
[37:22] Jesus of the new now how about or your
[37:29] prophet said Paul understood - over the
[37:34] old was Jesus of the new but the others
[37:38] didn't understand it
[37:45] now I asked you a simple question Sunday
[37:48] what did Peter believe he was what it
[37:54] introduced him and though it was a depth
[38:01] of revelation that you're dealing with
[38:07] you then you'll finally realize a name
[38:09] is dealing with depth of Revelation
[38:17] let me glad to show you in my lymphatic
[38:22] die Glocke with a name of Jesus as way
[38:26] it spelled and then right down below it
[38:30] the name of Jesus are spelled again and
[38:32] it spelled different why what is
[38:38] according to what you're referring to
[38:46] the streets move go to the voice of the
[38:50] sign 1964 and notice what did Paul how
[38:57] the rest of them didn't have he had the
[39:01] abundance of the revelation of the Word
[39:05] of God because it was Paul who
[39:08] recognized that Jesus of the New
[39:11] Testament was Jehovah old how come he
[39:17] could understand he remembers reading it
[39:21] because he made him Paul made him these
[39:29] others at him they ate and fished with
[39:31] him hunted with him never had John
[39:32] called Paul saw him after he'd been
[39:35] glorified he saw him as two over the
[39:42] older Jesus of the new one because he
[39:44] saw a deeper revelation but what did
[39:47] Peter an MC to hold the old is Jesus
[39:49] within him rock no no they didn't see
[39:54] two hotels you come on
[39:58] they saw the revelation of one true and
[40:02] living God so you don't read the message
[40:05] to try to understand you read to try to
[40:08] find what's your honey
[40:10] how would you like for me to tell you
[40:13] some people that brother Branham said
[40:16] Billy Graham understood the supreme
[40:22] deity of Jesus Christ when in supreme
[40:30] deity when you get home you'll read it
[40:31] you'll find a lot of people believe but
[40:34] you'll find a lot of them that he named
[40:36] turned out to be no good he's all a
[40:43] while when he said Billy ground because
[40:45] Baptist doctrine is one God he didn't
[40:49] understand the fullness of the Godhead
[40:50] rock he didn't understand but he just
[40:53] understood
[40:55] Jesus was gone he says why say I look
[41:01] he's things up before I come and bring
[41:03] them to you look what he said he said
[41:11] and notice what did Paul how the rest of
[41:19] them didn't have he had the abundance of
[41:24] the revelation of the Word of God
[41:26] because it was Paul who recognized that
[41:31] Jesus of the New Testament was to hold
[41:34] of the over remember if Paul taught it
[41:43] didn't had to be a restoration who God
[41:48] had to come to Brenham bring him the
[41:50] revelation to over the oh jesus of the
[41:52] new because it was a restoration Paul
[41:57] understood it what if I understand the
[42:02] deeper meaning of the name is it a name
[42:09] you're hunting or a revelation of the
[42:16] being you're claiming to worship do you
[42:23] have to call him Jesus you're calling
[42:28] father
[42:29] you call him Holy Ghost you calling
[42:33] Jehovah Jireh you know enjoy it is
[42:41] because you're calling in Jesus you can
[42:44] call him Emmanuel because that's God
[42:45] with us we ready to try the day road
[42:48] runs and see that they called in cases
[42:51] when they call him Emmanuel well that's
[42:55] what they were calling you going going
[43:00] to the it's another message of horse of
[43:02] the sign that was in California this is
[43:05] in Beaumont Texas look mark wrote all of
[43:12] them but they followed Jesus and wrote
[43:14] what he said but Paul had the revelation
[43:17] of who he was what about Peter them
[43:23] rotten walking with him and writing what
[43:25] he said inventor received the new Bertha
[43:28] Paul comes along a few years later and
[43:31] receives the newer takes all of the
[43:35] scrolls and probably what writings they
[43:37] had made in anyway it varies back there
[43:41] there one writer I put it 30s it's on
[43:43] put it 50s brother riding but just get
[43:46] to point all goes up to Damascus and he
[43:48] saves a few days with some of them then
[43:50] he takes off to the wilderness by cell
[43:52] with the scrolls and he understood by
[43:57] revelation it's at Jehovah do as Jesus
[44:02] was in youth but run said he would have
[44:04] not called that light that he saw Lord
[44:11] unless he knew who it was and you see
[44:17] how much deeper his revelation was then
[44:19] unto him and he said no man taught me
[44:22] these times there but the Holy Ghost
[44:28] Peter says the man had opened the door
[44:30] what does he say about Paul he said Paul
[44:33] says things that are hard to understand
[44:37] he said that does something now is the
[44:40] share out in other words if people are
[44:42] not right he said they'll stumble at
[44:44] what he's saying paraphrasing it of what
[44:49] Paul was saying because they couldn't
[44:52] understand
[44:57] if either saying his revelation was so
[45:00] great he let him write the Bible I'll
[45:04] wrote the biggest portion of New
[45:05] Testament right like Moses are the Old
[45:10] Testament the great man see Moses met
[45:13] God he wrote Paul met God and he wrote
[45:18] Paul that revelation he had he knew
[45:21] Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah
[45:24] oh he had the revelation of it watching
[45:28] and could place it to the Hebrews let's
[45:33] see now quote bread around him
[45:35] chapter one two three four five I
[45:38] believe it's right in the Hebrew series
[45:41] he said this is declaring the Godhead he
[45:45] said then now he goes in to the other
[45:48] things he said that was declaring the
[45:51] Gani that's pretty close perforating it
[45:54] he wrote letters notice he wrote the
[46:00] biggest portion of the New Testament
[46:03] what about don't you take Peter and all
[46:06] they're more the probably livid upset
[46:08] not one of them explained the communion
[46:15] no doctor spoke of it no dropp it said
[46:18] time it was not contained in the Word of
[46:21] God but Paul explained the communion
[46:26] till no wonder he had a greater
[46:28] revelation investments 1964 he was a
[46:35] Hebrew and I would have never worshipped
[46:37] anything or called anything Lord less he
[46:41] knowed it was bored less he knowed it
[46:47] was Lord and he knew as a teacher under
[46:50] Gamaliel that the angel of the Lord
[46:52] which was the logos that went out of God
[46:54] which was Christ that led them through
[46:56] the wilderness was in the form of a life
[46:59] a pillar of fire and when it struck him
[47:01] down he looked up and seen it dark he
[47:04] said Lord
[47:05] now he would have never said it never
[47:07] called nothing but that Lord but seeing
[47:11] it being a Hebrew he knowed that that
[47:13] was Jehovah that's the reason he had the
[47:16] revelation could say that Jesus of the
[47:19] New Testament was Jehovah the old that
[47:22] was his revelation because he had seen
[47:25] God he see me like I said the other day
[47:35] I want to get back to that later
[47:37] your prophet that you claim to follow
[47:41] said Scofield I was cute that's the draw
[47:49] one once at night
[47:50] Hoffman was the closest to Jesus Christ
[47:54] if anybody he'd ever seen
[47:55] well what Paul she
[48:05] he saw Jesus
[48:12] think about it because he had seen where
[48:20] we are hmm
[48:25] could say that Jesus was the old New
[48:27] Testament was over deal that was his
[48:30] revelation because he had seen Jehovah
[48:33] he saw him okay
[48:35] continue on get these out of the way
[48:38] then we'll do what next one number eight
[48:41] which is the absolute all had an
[48:46] experience that brought him to his
[48:48] decision and roll it up toward save time
[48:51] reading from that time on Paul knew
[48:53] that's Joe over the Old Testament with
[48:58] Jesus of the new he had something that
[49:01] he could hold to and that's how he could
[49:05] write that great book of hebrews paul
[49:08] saying it to more somebody got unveiled
[49:13] number nine the Bible said no man has
[49:16] seen God at any time but the only
[49:17] begotten of the father had to acquire
[49:19] him so Moses saw him veiled is a man now
[49:26] do we need to go what boy bringing out
[49:27] the other day what Moses see he said I'm
[49:30] can I see you he said you can't see my
[49:33] face so go stand in the rock I'll put my
[49:36] hand up he stood in the rock I believe
[49:39] as her sign rock he smoked when he got
[49:41] the water that's maybe me I don't charge
[49:44] you that but he stood in that rock and
[49:47] he walked by and he turned he looked he
[49:49] saw the back part of a man but around
[49:51] said he saw Jesus in theophany Jesus
[50:01] what he brought around see out in the
[50:03] field Jesus
[50:10] it was the awfully 100k Paul knew the
[50:16] job with the old with Jesus of the new
[50:18] is how he could write these things okay
[50:21] look let's go on so Moses saw him veiled
[50:24] as a man we found jovial to Jesus of the
[50:27] new we find the word in more faith you
[50:30] know what that means that God has
[50:32] changed this form when he changed his
[50:34] form of the amorphic which means that
[50:35] he's changed from Supernatural to
[50:37] natural that's what he done to come into
[50:39] place he just changed his mask in other
[50:41] words he's like a drama that he was
[50:43] acting out okay one more then we'll try
[50:45] to get into the message and look what he
[50:48] says this is off of the revelation of
[50:51] Jesus Christ here Jace book now that is
[50:58] the revelation Jesus Christ is God did
[51:01] you over the Old Testament is it Jesus
[51:03] anew no matter hard you try you can't
[51:07] prove there are three gods but it also
[51:11] takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to
[51:15] make you understand the truth that he is
[51:18] one it takes a revelation to see the
[51:24] over the old is Jesus or the new Satan
[51:28] crept into the church and blind it to
[51:30] the people to this truth and when they
[51:33] were blinded to it it wasn't long until
[51:37] the church went to Rome all right
[51:46] - over the old is Jesus of the new
[51:52] that's who he is let's look and see what
[51:56] your prophet called it in the church age
[51:57] book that number - well he's known as
[52:03] the god of the truth of God of the Amen
[52:05] so then roll it on that you read it from
[52:07] the iron the church a book here is you
[52:10] over the Old Testament the God of the
[52:11] Amen
[52:12] here is Jesus of the New Testament the
[52:14] God of the Amen euro is really LORD thy
[52:18] God is one God there it is again you
[52:20] hold the Old Testament is it Jesus of
[52:23] the you hear o Israel the Lord our God
[52:25] is one God the New Testament does not
[52:27] reveal another God it is a further
[52:30] revelation of the one and same God now
[52:37] follow that and listen a further
[52:39] revelation you take Jehovah the old
[52:43] you're only going to get a part
[52:46] Revelation none but when you take your
[52:52] whole of the old in Jesus and you put it
[52:55] together you get a complete revelation
[53:01] notice a further revelation Christ did
[53:04] not come down to make himself known I
[53:06] love this one if you not come to reveal
[53:09] the son he never talked about two gods
[53:12] he talked about one God then where's he
[53:16] said on my father one I cut my father's
[53:18] nut and now in this life stage we have
[53:20] come back to the capstone revelation the
[53:26] most important revelation of Godhead in
[53:30] the whole Bible you believe it that
[53:37] Jesus is God he and the father are one
[53:40] there is one God and His name is a lot
[53:45] of Jesus the capstone revelation to know
[53:52] of his supreme deity and they quote a
[53:57] few down through and then we'll jump
[53:58] right
[53:59] Atmos vision brother Brendan's talking
[54:01] about supreme deity of the Lord Jesus he
[54:03] said you can't get the first base until
[54:06] you believe that and walk out
[54:10] you don't believe Joe over the old Jesus
[54:12] with you you would not believe the
[54:14] supreme deity if you don't believe the
[54:17] supreme deity you're all mixed up what
[54:20] is the supreme deity it's a revelation
[54:23] of Jesus Christ
[54:26] what is the capstone revelation go over
[54:31] the oldest users of the new now maybe
[54:35] you can understand a little bit when we
[54:37] quoted over and over that the disciples
[54:40] did not get the headstone they got to
[54:48] worry said His Holy Spirit he did not
[54:52] get the headstone because it was removed
[54:55] to where they could not understand it it
[55:00] is not just a cornerstone and it doesn't
[55:02] fit the headstone never did come why
[55:06] cause Jesus preached it in Matthew 24
[55:08] when he preached six seals we're back a
[55:13] few weeks ago month or two ago when I
[55:15] was preaching about this message is the
[55:18] capstone this message of the seals this
[55:21] revelation of Jesus Christ is the
[55:23] capstone to the church that the Apostles
[55:26] never understood are you listening Peter
[55:31] and him understood he was over the old
[55:33] Jesus or the new but they couldn't put
[55:35] it together
[55:36] Paul can see it by revelation and go
[55:39] deeper into the depth of it and see it
[55:41] as a greater thing this prophet then
[55:47] could stand and go back into God's mind
[55:50] put across the mystery of God revealed
[55:52] and listen to him what God had in his
[55:56] mind he said now as in the church the
[56:01] revelation of Jesus Christ
[56:08] in the ages now face run-through they
[56:14] had his name one two three four
[56:16] lost his name in the fifth starts coming
[56:21] back in the sixth the name of Jesus he
[56:30] wasn't a name that they couldn't
[56:31] pronounce or something was like it was a
[56:34] revelation of a person that had been
[56:36] lost it had been lost in those dark ages
[56:40] that Jesus was Almighty God they brought
[56:44] him out as a Trinitarian concept or a
[56:46] team of God which meant that Jesus was a
[56:51] lesser God a demon God would never
[56:55] leaving that was trying to prove it not
[56:57] see in Council that Jesus was a lesser
[57:00] God that was the first nursery in
[57:05] council with Luke would you come back
[57:14] into the field church age he talks about
[57:20] a white stone to be given in a new name
[57:24] written which no man knows as he himself
[57:30] asked ever individual ever individual
[57:35] ever overcomer east message to each age
[57:41] holds out an incentive to the believer
[57:46] encouraging him to be an overcomer and
[57:49] die by be rewarded of the Lord in this
[57:53] stage the Spirit is promising hidden

[58:10] surgeon he says here that he's going to
[58:12] give the overcomer a white stone and in
[58:17] not own
[58:21] the stone a new name which the owner
[58:25] alone knows each true believers miss
[58:31] retail go ahead and wrote it up let's
[58:35] read it today each one of true believers
[58:38] is having 19 you have already had a 19
[58:48] you receive the new birth you're an
[58:51] overcomer then you had a name change
[58:53] let's read it and today each one of us
[58:57] true believers has had a change in name
[58:59] we are Christians that's our new name
[59:04] Christians
[59:06] it's a name coming to all of us now
[59:09] watching but one day we will have
[59:13] another change we will have a certainty
[59:18] receive a new name if he gets a new
[59:27] nothing we get in your name come on look
[59:31] what he said what does this new name
[59:35] that you know we're Christians it could
[59:40] well be that name was our true and
[59:43] original name written in the Lamb's Book
[59:46] of Life from the foundation of the world
[59:48] he knows the name but we do not one day
[59:55] had his good pleasure we will know all
[59:58] Shaw we're gonna get a new name it's not
[1:00:07] an odd part in the Bible because Abraham
[1:00:10] was Abram was chained to Abraham say
[1:00:12] rather say rah Saul to Paul Peter you
[1:00:17] know Simon to Peter anything that's
[1:00:21] relating to us then come up with a new
[1:00:25] name but look
[1:00:30] it's in a white stone it says in the
[1:00:32] Bible we read it a new night he alone
[1:00:36] knows so now there's no way that Wade
[1:00:41] can tell me my new night we're gonna see
[1:00:48] in a minute if desire could be that
[1:00:52] we're going to see that it might be
[1:00:54] after the world for we know a lot of
[1:00:56] times but we're Christians will have a
[1:01:10] certainty receiving unite but it could
[1:01:13] be very the name that you were written
[1:01:15] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:01:16] for the foundation of the world it's a
[1:01:23] wonderful talk you know we are his
[1:01:27] family you know what he knows the night

[1:01:51] hateful or arrogant well the Bible says
[1:01:54] you can't tell nobody
[1:01:55] so shut up you tell me your new name is

[1:08:47] pillar and the revelation of three names
[1:08:50] the name of God the name of the City of
[1:08:54] God in God's new name is the revelation
[1:08:58] that was given to this church in this
[1:09:01] age that's a six church a
[1:09:17] what about it
[1:09:24] going to the next one not tiring church
[1:09:29] age when Jesus overcame his name was
[1:09:34] changed and he would reveal that name he
[1:09:41] that would be with him overcome as he
[1:09:44] has he received a new name and I'll
[1:09:48] reveal my new name to him
[1:09:51] remember back over what ago was talking
[1:09:53] we did a new night could be the name was
[1:09:57] before the foundation water he said and
[1:10:00] I'll give him my good night so you never
[1:10:05] over comer I mean among such as that
[1:10:07] them leaders and so forth
[1:10:08] now all the children of Israel didn't
[1:10:10] get there nine chains of course that's
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:12] but those high leaders when they
[1:10:14] overcome had received a new night
[1:10:18] remember its to him go ahead to the next
[1:10:26] twenty three after Jesus overcame
[1:10:31] overcome he received a new night himself
[1:10:35] ever overcome her not ever overcome the
[1:10:41] church when it's completely overcome the
[1:10:43] revelation of again begins to be real to
[1:10:47] them so we're going out to wait from
[1:10:50] some mountains of the full overcoming
[1:10:55] remember we're still overcoming when
[1:11:00] Jesus what about this one
[1:11:06] go ahead to twenty five
[1:11:14] and I'll write my new name upon him my
[1:11:18] new name when all becomes new then he
[1:11:25] will take upon him a new name and that
[1:11:31] name will be the name of the bride also
[1:11:35] remember you're still miss Jesus now you
[1:11:38] better hold on to that part until all
[1:11:42] becomes new then whatever his name is
[1:11:46] is your name that write the name of the
[1:11:53] bride all show what that name is nun
[1:12:00] dark-hunter which means you try to
[1:12:03] figure it out
[1:12:03] prop it up do it you look it up and try
[1:12:05] to do this try to figure it out
[1:12:12] none dark injector that's the same word
[1:12:15] as conjunct I mean it would have to be a
[1:12:19] revelation of the Spirit given so
[1:12:21] conclusively that none would dare denied
[1:12:24] when no doubt he will leave that
[1:12:27] revelation to the day when he desires to
[1:12:29] give that name
[1:12:31] suffice it to know that it will be more
[1:12:35] wonderful than he could ever you know
[1:12:38] one could ever imagine
[1:12:40] well don't you think brother Dale and
[1:12:44] what you've been doing tonight has been
[1:12:46] that word conjectures just look it up
[1:12:50] it's trying to figure it out don't you
[1:12:55] think - not you've been trying to figure
[1:12:57] out something I had named design yet
[1:13:00] tell a name when I am down the cubes
[1:13:03] meal you can accuse me at one time for
[1:13:10] 50 years I've had these dollars maybe
[1:13:16] not a few calls again cause the computer
[1:13:24] I've also had this one
[1:13:27] what is the name go ahead to 26 places
[1:13:34] an answer is on the seals what is the
[1:13:38] name of the that will be on the people
[1:13:42] of Revelation Street well the revelation
[1:13:46] 3:12 it says the name of the city among
[1:13:48] God's name in my new name
[1:13:50] what is the name I'll that will be on
[1:13:53] the people of Revelations Trent well I
[1:13:56] don't know yeah he said give them a new
[1:14:03] name I don't know what it is
[1:14:07] this is questions and answers on the
[1:14:09] seals it would probably be problem
[1:14:19] probably may know when we get there I
[1:14:23] don't know what it is now so he didn't
[1:14:29] know the new night yet he's preaching so
[1:14:37] let's drop back in the seal book and get
[1:14:39] one quote just what everybody wants go
[1:14:43] ahead we're going to get done in a hurry
[1:14:45] tonight we didn't pretty good this is
[1:14:49] from the first seal I regret 283 in
[1:14:53] Jesus his name on earth was Redeemer
[1:14:56] Jesus when he was on earth he was a
[1:15:01] redeemer that's true but when he
[1:15:05] conquered death and hell and overcame
[1:15:08] them and ascended on high he received in
[1:15:11] uniting that's the reason they holler
[1:15:17] the way they do and don't get nothing
[1:15:20] it'll be revealed in the Thunder
[1:15:27] you notice the mystery is coming riding
[1:15:32] there's got to be something it changed
[1:15:38] this church it will be revealed in the
[1:15:46] thunders questions and answers in 64
[1:15:51] number twenty-eight Glen now the seven
[1:15:57] thunders which equals seven mysteries
[1:15:59] already been revealed that's an argument
[1:16:03] now where the thunders has been revealed
[1:16:05] or the shield has even been revealed
[1:16:07] that's an argument in the message you
[1:16:09] read what he says how the seven thunders
[1:16:12] which equals seven mysteries already
[1:16:14] been revealed were they revealed in the
[1:16:16] seven seals but are yet but are yet not
[1:16:18] known unto us as the thunders yet no
[1:16:22] they were revealed in the seven seals
[1:16:25] that's what the thunders was about they
[1:16:29] was revealed the thunders was the
[1:16:32] revelation contained in the seven seals
[1:16:38] one more now let's find the symbols
[1:16:44] first he'll find out what the thunder
[1:16:48] means that's perfectly we know that the
[1:16:52] thunder was the voice of God when
[1:16:55] they're sealed open so well he said be
[1:17:01] revealed in the seals be revealed in the
[1:17:06] thunders how the thunder sounded as the
[1:17:11] sealed open that's the argument of the
[1:17:13] people of the message now they're
[1:17:15] arguing like crazy split all the way one
[1:17:19] group says the seal they broke it the
[1:17:21] other group says they're broke the words
[1:17:25] our concern about the thunder the Syst
[1:17:28] under would be the voice of God to tell
[1:17:31] you what to seal is but he said if it
[1:17:34] ain't right going 152 when you look
[1:17:38] through 155 158 is a syllable
[1:17:41] and see if he ain't telling you the
[1:17:44] Thunder she was a god when the seal
[1:17:47] breaks well the point is to see how the
[1:17:52] seals broke was the thunder the voice of
[1:17:57] God those seals and if it was revealed
[1:18:06] to the Prophet and then when it's
[1:18:10] revealed to you and I and the thunders
[1:18:16] reports of God the thunders don't sound
[1:18:21] in heaven quoting him they say I'll know
[1:18:25] her well because the Prophet stood here
[1:18:29] told us what them seven thunders were
[1:18:32] the revelations contained in the seven
[1:18:35] seals are we looking for a new name
[1:18:41] that's the only statement I wanna make
[1:18:44] are we looking for a new name some kind
[1:18:48] of a secret worded name or some or some
[1:18:53] kind of a something they've called him
[1:18:56] Melchizedek they called it every night
[1:18:57] they said when he was let's see one
[1:18:59] group said when he was dying that the
[1:19:01] new name of Jesus my message forgive me
[1:19:04] the new day of Jesus when he when he was
[1:19:07] dying on the cross he spoke he said Eli
[1:19:10] a life that's in there what it was my
[1:19:13] god my god why is that person they said
[1:19:15] that was a new night he died speaking in
[1:19:17] come well all right
[1:19:24] this is my statement until whatever God
[1:19:31] has planned is finished with a little
[1:19:36] Bride of Christ let's hold on to the
[1:19:40] name of Jesus and don't try to find
[1:19:44] something else because you would be
[1:19:47] conjuring it up you know kind of figure
[1:19:51] it out so leave it alone
[1:19:52] didn't we make no but what if it's made
[1:19:55] known as he said about the three twelve
[1:19:57] may be known may know when we get time
[1:20:01] and see that's where people don't follow
[1:20:03] the Prophet he never put a new name
[1:20:07] under the Seventh Seal I'm excusing the
[1:20:09] seven churches it's under the six
[1:20:13] churches and under the six year change
[1:20:17] one or the name of Jesus was to be
[1:20:21] restored opened over so it is a new name
[1:20:27] of Jesus is it some other name we're
[1:20:29] looking for are we looking for a
[1:20:31] different deeper meaning to the night
[1:20:36] what Apollo how did the other didn't
[1:20:38] have a deeper meaning of the night when
[1:20:42] he brought around him how that Paulding
[1:20:43] out a deeper meaning of the name not
[1:20:46] trying to find a new name we try to find
[1:20:50] a meaning for the hour that we're living
[1:20:56] and yours the inner statement of a
[1:21:01] Christ a mixture of God reveal the bride
[1:21:05] is part of the mystery the threefold
[1:21:09] revelation on God was reported to Christ
[1:21:12] on Chrysler jerk
[1:21:13] take her back to the garden the Prophet
[1:21:18] said the Godhead is not complete without
[1:21:22] you he said in the bride would be the
[1:21:27] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:21:33] let's just worry about using look maybe
[1:21:39] it's a better where I don't know what to
[1:21:40] say you don't want to say doing away
[1:21:43] with the nine code is not going to be
[1:21:44] doing away with the night
[1:21:48] it's the acts of a play the bride is
[1:21:52] part of it if you've ever studied the
[1:21:55] master especially the seals it's the
[1:21:58] actual play but around says where did
[1:22:04] this one come in revelations five he
[1:22:08] said he was back behind the throne
[1:22:10] making intercession he said he walks
[1:22:14] forth read revelation 4 time to throne
[1:22:18] revelation 5:9 one sitting on the throne
[1:22:21] see he comes forward climbed up on the
[1:22:24] throne and shuts down and said I'm the
[1:22:28] one that done it until out - tonight
[1:22:31] don't be worried about it you have a
[1:22:34] brother so-and-so said he had his new
[1:22:37] name well then we know he's not right so
[1:22:40] if somebody comes alone and said God's
[1:22:42] revealed my new name and then he's all
[1:22:45] revealed his new Knight he said well
[1:22:48] you're out start with because you can't
[1:22:50] tell me what your name is so you can't
[1:22:51] tell me than you know I'm planning I'm
[1:22:55] blowing what is that true he said what
[1:23:02] do you mean I mean a deeper revelation
[1:23:06] for the word of God that started in
[1:23:10] Genesis to unfold when he said let us
[1:23:13] make man in our own image
[1:23:16] that man is wade was covering his a
[1:23:19] spirit man he's a theophany
[1:23:24] he's God in another form ever born-again
[1:23:29] believer there ever will be is in
[1:23:32] Genesis 1:26 and 27 28 tells them to
[1:23:37] multiply and replenish what I spiritual
[1:23:41] that spiritual supposed to be so what I
[1:23:45] thought was supposed to be doing
[1:23:46] I thought preaching of the gospel was
[1:23:49] the sowing of the seed the home
[1:23:55] I thought by you sisters going out and
[1:23:57] testifying to the neighbors that you
[1:24:00] were sowing the seed of God why can't
[1:24:07] you see it that simple
[1:24:10] it's just keep on going
[1:24:12] it rose that way you're going to work
[1:24:14] for 50 years I've been going like this
[1:24:15] so I don't think I'm gonna quit now
[1:24:18] I'll come very close many many many
[1:24:21] times
[1:24:21] cuz just sit down and say you don't have
[1:24:26] it
[1:24:27] Otis drove me crazy everything in the
[1:24:30] book it won't drive me to the place
[1:24:34] because my off quote the prophet one
[1:24:37] quote I got in there he says there is no
[1:24:40] way the enemy will ever take away from
[1:24:44] the bride of Jesus Christ the supreme
[1:24:47] deity of Jesus Christ is that scriptural
[1:24:52] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[1:24:55] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[1:24:58] it
[1:24:59] so we're standing on the rock come on
[1:25:02] brother hey with 20 minutes till 9:00 I
[1:25:04] thought we'd be later to a board to give
[1:25:06] me a little extra you got any questions
[1:25:09] well they're coming up two musicians
[1:25:12] come on you you got any questions sister
[1:25:20] little minute without together
[1:25:29] like she got when a prophet come seek
[1:25:34] it's not all inertia got it okay when a
[1:25:42] prophet comes he comes to the whole
[1:25:44] population of an area right I mean he'd
[1:25:47] come to the to the lost and the ones
[1:25:50] that would receive his message so when
[1:25:52] you say your prophet said it's to people
[1:25:56] who don't believe all that he's a
[1:25:59] prophet would say and in that by turning
[1:26:02] that down they've turned the word down
[1:26:04] right okay Stefon shoes you mean you
[1:26:09] turn it down he's our prophet too right
[1:26:12] did we turn it down yeah but now brother
[1:26:16] Dylan is my question okay see I'm not
[1:26:19] worried because I've been standing this
[1:26:23] away for 50 years declaring let's keep
[1:26:29] on trying to understand the name of
[1:26:33] Jesus and may I say it this way and not
[1:26:42] be sarcastic if you had never heard the
[1:26:45] Prophet if I had never heard the Prophet
[1:26:48] where would we ever have anything about
[1:26:51] knowing the name of God is Jesus and
[1:26:56] then they saying what about Lilith if
[1:26:58] for 50 years I hadn't hammered it about
[1:27:01] his name being Jesus or do you get it
[1:27:05] into words
[1:27:14] what are they preaching it language it
[1:27:17] always be a great revelation we're up
[1:27:19] above that with it they don't even talk
[1:27:21] about the name of Jesus no more a great
[1:27:27] thing but about it listen just remember
[1:27:31] what I'm saying
[1:27:32] it's a furthermore the revelation of
[1:27:35] Jesus Christ that I'm interested in and
[1:27:40] when that finishes it then he can become
[1:27:42] proclaim and unite and very easily be
[1:27:51] when we get there
[1:27:55] that's our self interpretation no that's
[1:27:58] a statement you make your why can't I
[1:28:01] make mine I don't please I've had people
[1:28:06] look at me like I don't believe that I
[1:28:07] said that's your statement it is knew a
[1:28:10] thing or what I would see we're not
[1:28:16] arguing statements we're talking about
[1:28:20] Jesus Christ
[1:28:28] well Gottman 250 once parable thereby
[1:28:32] knows at them the mighty God is Jesus
[1:28:36] the Prince of Peace is he everlasting
[1:28:41] father the King eternally the winning of
[1:28:46] all wisdom of all things are made the
[1:28:51] whole life we were a nation jesus was
[1:28:54] explained what if we were to message
[1:28:57] that will change on us all the Godhead
[1:29:04] and is all in him what have we actually
[1:29:08] heard the message this song if you say
[1:29:13] we have a sense then you're looking for
[1:29:17] another prophet when you love with I
[1:29:21] know the story I know what a big portion
[1:29:25] of people this makes me do it they
[1:29:27] looking for brother Branham to come back
[1:29:31] and he's gonna tell us these times
[1:29:34] praise God he never said a word about
[1:29:40] that except one day
[1:29:43] he can be here with us for 30 40 days
[1:29:48] after the resurrection and he can bring
[1:29:55] us the truth of thanks but he won't
[1:29:59] bring this Redemption because Redemption
[1:30:02] will be over when the resurrection comes
[1:30:06] Redemption over to the Gentiles what if
[1:30:14] it could be then he Jesus Redeemer on
[1:30:18] earth before the world he was Jesus the

[1:31:32] us we should all desire not to argue and

[1:31:40] Jesus seeing standing among us see him
[1:31:45] as the alive the Word of God
