lord for these children that they would get up here and they would stand up and they would sing about you and they would to show the world lord out there that they are worshiping you and not a uh just

them and and everything to get everything done we ask you to just have your way with each one of us and bless and guide everything have your way now as we read your word and we thank you in jesus name amen so if you'd like to turn in your scriptures to ephesians turn to romans excuse me first in ephesians you know nobody got it up yet but we'll get to it okay romans 3 24 i just want to make a few comments about what i've been preaching on in a very short point and then we will go into the rest of the service paul says being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus and what god has set forth as a perpetu to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood i didn't put this one on but to declare his righteousness for the remissions of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god all right now we'll go to ephesians 1 and verse 6. to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in he had to bound it toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us what the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purpose in himself so we don't know that it's in his time right you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i just want to cover a point you know and i really want to ask you a question you know we talk a lot about grace we talk about it being grace grace amazing grace and talk about how it's unmerited favor and and all of the things of being in the line of grace and you know what i want to ask the question is is it for you or is it for me you know the title is grace is it for me you know everything that we receive from god we must receive by revelation all right to where he can reveal it unto us and see then grace as i tried to cover in the life's message there was the greatest attribute that i could think of in all of the things that god was displaying was grace because it was way back before the law it was in the law at the time you know and after the law but there was no grace in the law it was the letter and that's why paul would say the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life see there's no grace in it now there was grace while it was in existence but the law the law was just like putting you in jail it was nothing to get you out it was a condemner you know a prosecutor of things but then see we believe that grace is unmerited favor that we didn't do anything to get it right and see then it's what god gave to man and remember how we brought it out that the grace was the first thing in the garden because as quick as they done wrong the atonement was made that was grace all right see then we covered that grace being to israel in the form of a prophet and see now to the world a prophet is judgment all right now don't misunderstand me see to the world and to people that are are not what we call christians and things a prophet is a judgment sign right all right but to the people of god who will accept it it's grace why because god is going to speak you see he never does anything outside of coming through the prophets and speaking through them you know his word and brother branham even used it he said the messiah is going to speak so we know thor john the baptist was that introduced the messiah all right as i told you we started off then talking about a prophet and in it amazing that you wind up in the gentile dispensation of winding up that you wind up with a prophet being sent to bring us the complete word all right now that's to me is grace and like brother brown said one time like this he says then god gave he said he went to the jews and said he even went to the samaritans you remember in doings you know and and talking with them a little bit but said he never went to the gentiles all right because he was going to go to the gentiles in the end time all right now i appreciate that i think you know about that grace of what it is but what i want you to think about grace is only for those who accept it you remember a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one all right you can hold the paper in your hand you remember the man did they they said it signed you know abraham lincoln and all and he had the paper but yet they killed him the next morning because he refused to accept his grace all right see then they had to pass the law apart that grace is not you know a pardon not a pardon unless received is one well we ought to see that's that way in god he's not going to force himself upon you he will not make you receive him see he won't we want to thank well there paul was he he you know he just got knocked down and and and you know he made him take it no he didn't make him take it see because you can't do that all right but is it for you and before i start that point i want to remind you of what i tried to say that may be hard for the natural mind to comprehend but to me grace is a person it is the person of jesus christ to come down pay the price do the atonement do everything and then come and live in us now if that wouldn't be what you would think about grace i don't know what what you would want to think about how that he would do every bit of that for you and i but now remember then being a person he is the person of the word so he doesn't leave us to just look out and say well grace is a person he died for me you know he leaves us the word he or brought us the word which is the person of god in word form all right any problem with that john 1 1. you know in the beginning was the word word with god and the word was god all right now then that word being there being the the product of god's grace that he himself would come down and die to release his life that he might be able to transmit that life to you and i or to bring the grace into being so that's what we've been talking about on the what we've been doing is displaying his attributes um to me that's the greatest this is message number eight on it that the greatest display of his attributes is to see what really true grace is now not disgrace i've been through it over up and down every form trying to make sure you don't misunderstand me you know i mean making sure you you don't get the wrong thing out of what i'm saying see we don't believe in disgrace we believe in true grace disgrace won't get you anywhere you said and holler all day long that you're you're god's children and and or can't be judged and all this stuff you can do everything all day long you're still going to judgment if it's not corrected right all right see then that'll that'll put us into that place to where that we you know we want to not just scream for grace but to realize what it cost do you realize what it costs to bring grace i mean you've ever just really thought about that point what it costs to bring grace into being that god himself not a second person we don't believe in trinitarianism but it wouldn't matter if i did if i believed in trinitarianism i'd have three piles up here to show you that all of that is still a product of grace you know and would be three times worse because each one of what they would suffer but we know what he suffered to bring that grace into being he came into the world and lived as a man died at the hands of a sinful man beat until he looked like a piece of hamburger meat there was a cat of nine tails you know on the things but being that very person of grace people to think about that and then reading the word and the prophet said if you don't see what christ in every verse go back and read again but i want to ask you or i want a thought in your mind grace is it for us all right now we know for certainty that god paid the price for everybody right now get down to the not a pardon unless being received as one all right grace paid the price for every person in the world all right but what's wrong with the people then they won't accept what was done for them right if they won't accept it then god can't override that and make you receive it right so then now getting to that way of approaching it we can boldly say that grace is not for everyone right because it's for those who will accept it but for those who will not accept it sure he paid the price for the bible city for the sins of the world all right he died for everybody in the world but for all but those who would accept him was the ones that grace would be imparted grace is not imparted unto you unless you receive it well it don't matter what i do god loves me so much to you no no no no not quite now that's really getting a little bit further than the baptist used to be you know but think about it grace now what we want to do sometimes is we want to uh divide out things i don't know whether that's a good word to use but what i mean is we want to even look in the bible and looking into the bible we look at it and we we want to think part of it's true and maybe part of it's not well now number one what kind of a bible would that be all right and if yours reads that away then i'd suggest you check the authors because you may have some good news for modern men or something involved you know even they're not that far off most of the time but you know i would check it out but what about the promises of god they're for everybody right but everybody won't receive it that's right so he's not responsible correctly because we make our own choice all right see then once he lays it out in front of us he gives us a choice to receive it if we don't receive it it don't matter how much you read and holler and scream about grace it's no good all right but what about is part of the word right is my point i want to get at for a minute it's part of the word right and part of it not right then how would we have hebrews 13 8 to be saying that he's the same yesterday today and forever well that that old bible that's just what some man wrote well thank god that's true you know i mean that's that's true that's what some man wrote but you know that some man was guided by the hand of god to write what he wrote so it's not the words of man it's the word of god because if he didn't you'd change one one you'd say in the beginning was the word that man thought about and hoped it was right and maybe it was right and he wrote it down no it doesn't even mention it like that does it the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god all right but i want you to think of it like that to doubt one word or a promise you know what would it do to us to that one word what would it do to us then to believe that part of the word is correct but part of it's not correct now who are we going to get to tell us what's right and what's wrong you know what i mean we've got to find something right right but see i thought the word was correct i thought every word was correct i thought it was all the word of god because if it's not all the word of god then how can we judge what part is god and what is not see it's either i'm looking at what the prophet said about he said it's either all good or there's none of it good i like to quote i was looking for something you know he said it's either all good or none of it's good it's either right or we need somebody to tell us what's right and what's wrong all right now a lot of people think brother branham come to tell us what's right and what's wrong now did he ever tell us what part of the word was wrong i've been around quite a while and you my understanding of of the way he brings things is it's either all god or let's forget it right and that's paraphrase quote that's very close you know but think about it is it right or is it wrong if it's of god it must be right all right and he'd say it like this say well we believe this we don't believe this you know well you can't believe this without believing this all right now that's taken from the message when his eyes were open they knew him you got to believe it all it's either all god or it isn't any god all right now remember the point i was making a few weeks ago on the marriage and divorce that we were talking on that everybody wants to correct brother branham you know he's wrong here he's right here and you know he should have said this the author said that what he's done he ought to let me showed him what was right you know people don't like me being that strong about it but isn't that true i mean if you can tell me brother brown was wrong i want you to show me right and then if you can show me he was wrong then i need to follow you why because you straightened him out well you remember the point i was making though did he you know everybody they they want us correct this they want to correct that but i haven't heard any doctrine yet where they're correct in marriage and divorce you know everybody wants that everybody wants the grace you know oh they may have a lot of interpretations about thoughts but everybody's kind of holding on to that well if that's right then the other's right but if that's wrong then the other is wrong that's what we just read right so it's either all god or it's not god you say well there's problems here with this hey you don't let's don't we have a prophet to place our things upon we're not people of the world that what is your and i like that wiggle word i love him i love him big old words people come up with you know what is your input why don't you say what do you got to say you know but what is your input on this do you think the word of god let's see what was that and it used to be do you think that this is the word of god or contains the word of god that's argued in this what 60s way back but what i'm trying to get a point to you and i is if part of the word is right and part of it is wrong we need someone to correct the errors but don't say brother branham corrected the errors because there was no errors to correct true he said the the dian's in the bus is in the right place now i know we're all real good to read where he says well it should have been the lie instead of a lie that's not correcting it that's modernizing it or putting in the terminologies that helps us to understand it's not a correction it's just a point that it's the same lie that he told eve you say well eli was told to eve and they lies told of us that's the same lie that's all thee is emphasizing huh didn't worry say you know that they without us or whatever precede us you know try to change wordings those words are not changed in their to correct it it's just more modernistic terms we use all right he said well what are you getting at brotherdale i'm getting at what i think and i believe we want to believe what we want to believe and we won't accept truth because that it's the the things that so embedded in our mind until you know we don't want to give in we don't want to admit that we're wrong we don't want to believe that we could be deceived we want to leave it on the basis that i believe this well what about this well i don't know about that i i don't know whether that's right or not well how do you know what the other is right or not i mean we've been taught all of our life this is your right hand how do you know all i got to do is turn around and which way you're going there you say well it's because of this because no i don't prove a point the point is we've been told all of our life a horse is measured by hands not by inches right that's right you go down you say i got a horse down here i don't know how many you'd say 14 hands high well you put one of these little kids down there and a hand you got a little bitty pony you get old brother r line and you stretch out his hand on there and you've got a 9-foot horse now whose hand is what you getting what i mean it's whatever we want to make it to be right and what tickles me today this this this is what it gets me and you'll say that horse i don't know about the hands what a well we'll want to say that horse has 14 hands the others say 13 and a half and the other guy i'll say 15 and they'll argue and shoot each other over what size the horse is or do we do the word of god that way what are you getting at either this message is right or it's not right there's not a gray area to be fallen into the message is right or not right all right if the message is right let's follow the message that's simple isn't it all right if he's right over here and explaining the godhead then he's right over here explaining the no eternal hells you know the things but yeah we want to judge what we think is right and put it to that point all right but what do you think about it do you believe the bible is correct yes do you believe that to add one word to it is death to take one word from it is death then do we believe it you say well well really what are you getting at because you start off talking about grace well we baptist used to describe grace as unmerited favor all right and in their terminologies it meant that it was all right for me to go ahead and do little bitty things now none of them didn't believe in doing big great big ones you know they did hold that point but it's all right do little bitty things because we're saved by grace and they spent all the time trying to figure out whether you were sinning or whether you was uh what was that word you were uh you know manifesting it or whatever you know was doing well you move over to the presbyterian well they kind of held a little more line of say be keeping things a little straighter and and when you would get to that point then you would ask them about grace and they would describe it and they would put a little form of display of works maybe within that you know to do all right you move up to another group of people and ask them what do you think about grace and see everybody would give you the same definition unmerited favor but their description of that unmerited favor determined what they believed more than the words that they used to describe it right that's why you don't have to worry about me because i tell you what i believe but you know yourself most preachers you're not going to get out of them what they believe they're going to just kind of hold back just you know and you're never really going to know exactly what they believe you'll hear them one time and they're going to get a new body huh the next time you hear them they're going to get this body redeemed well you don't know what to believe well no you don't know what to believe because they made two statements see what they're doing is they're trying to fill out the group with them that they're talking to you know and they're trying to find out how many in that group believes it this way or how many of them believes it this way you had never caught on to preachers like that yet you had never seen a preacher and he'll be preaching he'll be reading he'll be preaching he'll be preaching that long he'll just lock in on one side and he'll walk at one side he'll never go the other way because his side over here is agreeing with him right i just watch it and say you know come on wake up but now what about it is grace for everybody if they will accept it yeah but it's not for those who will not accept it all right and see then looking at it and seeing that what it means to you and i we look through the bible and we see the bible is describing the message of grace but it's really describing the person of the lord jesus christ correct this is revelation that over in revelation 1 or you know is the revelation of jesus christ and what do you think about it now laying it down and getting it straight and then we're going to our point we don't believe in disgrace so we're not in that category we don't believe in garbage cans we believe in being the fact that you know that sure all of us are human and we have all made mistakes we have all done wrong in our lives and we all needed salvation all right and then that salvation would be given unto us as unmerited favor because the only thing you could do was the point of what you could accept it then you go through justification sanctification you know and the baptism is really him so you're it's not a point of saying we're going through it's the point of what he's doing all right so then that proves whether or not you believe it by the fact of what you're doing you know you are at least receptive of it and then by accepting it you know the pardon we do look on the pardon now and we see that the requirement is to not just to be as the man was to take the pardon and say you can't kill me the point is now that we must take the pardon and accept it but our accepting it is what that we must walk through certain things whereas he had to accept it walk out of jail we have to go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost to make us the children of god and make us then to work that his grace has been bestowed upon us and paul said therefore being justified freely by his grace me we become his children all right and see then we believe that grace we believe it it's not for everybody because everybody won't have it but we believe it's for everybody that will have it and made unto that point of grace all right now you know that there's people who believe that you must go to the tabernacle sister sister barbara her husband believes he got to go to pakistan or what that place is overseas you know and you know they got to make their trip every so often and and then we life and make fun of them but you know that a lot of people believe that you got to go to jeffersonville for everything and they believe there's nothing authentic unless it comes out of jeffersonville what do you think do you believe the message is only for those in jeffersonville i don't think you do or you'd be there now right i would if that's what i believe i'd be there right right so it's pretty well proof and i don't believe it that way i thank god for what's come through jeffersonville uh-huh for the spoken words and all the different things we have here done everything we could in our day to kind of stay in a line of believing until when they put out the thing that we was all wrong for getting the messages the way we got them we went and purchased the message from them with the right to use that message you know to distribute the gospel we paid the price of what they wanted to do i've never argued with them about the things i didn't think it was fully necessary but i thought that's a good idea costs 500 that's not going to kill us we'll just make sure that everybody can't say we've done this wrong we'll go do it right all right i thank god for what all of these people have done y'all didn't come up some of you most of you didn't come up the way we did when we came into the message you know i mean i bought every concordance it was you know what first 15 pages was to prove their doctrine to be right i got the books if you want to read them and i'm going to show you the doctrines you know but the rest of it was good and even them quotes was good when they were put in the right place but i don't everything i could to try to do that because see y'all you got the computers and you just sometimes for a sermon i'd search for three months for one quote my wife would like she'd come in my study and i'd have earphones on listening to a tape and reading a book and she looked down and said what are you listening to and i'm saying well i got the future home in my ears and i'm reading uh see not air with a shock and she'd just shake her head how could i read one book and listen to a tape on another one well i'm just waiting on some quote to come up you know i had to do that i thank god for everything that's ever been done i went to the baptist preacher and told him that i appreciated what all he done for me when i walked out i've had to walk out of this message in a couple of places you know what i told them that i appreciate it and i do i appreciate people that are trying to help in any way irregardless of what you're trying to do trying to finish it up i'll get something good out of it if i approach it correctly because see what i'm wanting is my pardon all right and everything i can get to do that on that pardon i accept that so is this grace is the pardon of salvation you know grace for salvation do you fully believe that or you only believe heart see if you believe you've done something good and that's the reason god saves you then your your grace is not grace that's works right that's something you've done but when you know and realize you didn't do nothing but then you scream and run to that pardon and then you hold it you know and you come out of it with an understanding of the grace of god do you know that brother branham actually said this message was only for the tabernacle his brother dale says something then he throws it up on the screen so let's read it what do you think about it what are you thinking about this message uh let's go to number number four brother well excuse me going down going down to five i like that one for the point of what i want you to get rolled it onto five this is taken from a thinking man's filter and look what he says this message all and all other the messages i speak on is directed to my congregation it's not for your congregation so unless you want to receive it but it's directed to this people all right look at what he said i want you to know that that this is only for my congregation i speak these things i have a right to do that because i've been set by the holy spirit to watch over these sheep now now we've got a thing laid out that we have the words of the prophet that it's only for his congregation right well we all got to pack up and go to jail see now you must whether you like it or not you've got to put a little self-thought is that a bad word to swallow give me a gooder one i'll say it you've got to self-interpret come on if you don't self-interpret and say wait a minute we are his congregation then we're not his congregation we either are or we're not right uh the hall of background either right or wrong it's either god or not god but i don't interpret nothing i just say what he says well that's good huh look on over to number six taken out of thinking men's filter and he's talking about how these things was done in top to israel for the congregation of israel only no is that true god wasn't to the people around right on to israel if ministers disagree on anything that said this is for my congregation that the lord has given me to preach too okay so now what are we doing go ahead to number seven this is taken from marriage and divorce and i'm speaking to our followers only who is following me in this message only not the outside bear me record of this before god just to this group only so is marriage in divorce only for those who go to the tabernacle see now you're going to have to do what you think that you don't do that brother dale has got in trouble 40 years of trying to get you to do is to use your own brain i don't think i just want the mind of god well remember it ain't up here it's down here now if the mind of god was up here we'd be in good shape or better but the mind of god is down in here all right look what about the grace of marriage and divorce some believe it's only for those who go to the tabernacle or for those who were sitting there when he preached it now let's read what he said this is go back to number three and this is taken from marriage and divorce paragraph uh 312 313. don't you dare try to do it again i'm speaking only to my congregation so now is that right or is it wrong now you must define what is right and what's wrong you must define if he's talking about that group of people that was sitting there that day amen or is it the message that's going to the entire bride that he is the that we as the bride are his congregation now which definition do you use right look at number four this is from christ the mystery god revealed preached in 1965 paragraph 40. these tales going he's talking now he's speaking why in the marriage in divorce you said this you said that and you know these tapes goes only i'm speaking to my congregation brother i'm not responsible for what god gives you to shepherd i'm responsible what kind of food i feed these people this is for this tabernacle only see now if the people want to listen to the tapes that's up to them but i'm speaking to what god has given to me it was their sins that was omitted right see it to this this is only to this people right here the people here in the tabernacle my own flock now if god wants to be you know if you want to people want to be hybrid go ahead now what is what are you going to use there what is your definition i lay before you a a situation so we can define that the grace of god you know even if we try to upgrade it pull it on we would define the grace of god for salvation for the new birth of things you know would be for all those who believe and when the prophet would say this message is for my followers we quickly move ourselves into that point of being a follower brother and said about paul he said paul was real quick to think about himself as being part of the promise that's paraphrasing it but it's close about the seed of abraham said he was quick to say that see he wanted the people to know you know i'm related to this all right what about you is the grace for anybody that will accept it of salvation but then we move up to marriage in divorce and we had to be either sitting in the building that day when it was preached or have to be in that building today to be able to qualify for marriage and divorce that's why i asked the question is it for me what do you think i don't know arguments to nobody about anything no problems but as pastor i state what i believe i believe when the prophet said this is for my congregation i'm happy to relate to the point that i believe that i'm part of that congregation and that doesn't mean i've got to go to jeffersonville you know because i believe it like he said when he said lord said you just couldn't trust me see all these others has got their million dollar buildings and time and the lord told him said just look up he said here's your church right paraphrasing the word i remember exactly the words of you but here's your congregation your message is to the whole world those who will accept it all right now we're going to be the ones that defines well now it's got to be this way it's got to be that way well okay but just remember if you can take out one piece of your puzzle and say that only applies to jeffersonville indiana and put it down that way or that it only applies to those that were sitting there that day you know that it was preached then you have just annihilated your whole point of grace is it for me they have a group not too far from us and they have that this brother's a missionary so he goes out and he starts churches and then he puts in a pastor that becomes the associate pastor because the other man's a pastor you know because that's kind of like apostolic successions and different things you know that are going and what do we have you know oh is it up to one to a point you know somebody to a position or is it the holy spirit to lead them into that position uh i don't go to that point but i don't have no problems because it's none of my business you know anything's none of my business you know what that's done in my business but you see if i'm going to believe one thing is for me then i'm going to believe it's all for me he said well do you believe the grace of god is i believe the grace of god let me give the life statement of it and that here's somebody he's right over in that church over there and he's you know he needs salvation i believe he can come into the word of god and receive that as salvation if he has a marital situation he can come under the grace of marriage and divorce now well i'll go with you on the salvation but it won't go willy on the marriage in divorce well all right you're taking hyphen atonement i'm taking it all because why would you want to believe it that way now i don't have anything to call him up telling me to come over here hey we're sitting right here i've never told any of you you were right we have marital situation sitting here you know in the church you know what i mean people married before etc i've never told any of you you're right i always tell you that you must go before god and ask him what's right because if i told you what was right that would be my presumption right because i don't know the whole story you know i i don't know everything correctly so that to me is why brother branham said he said we don't have time to straighten these things out he would have had to take an ever individual person to went through their life and seen what it was and to do he would have had to do and he didn't have the time but he said i say go on as you are all right i accept that as being the word of god but i accept that it's being for anyone who can receive it but if you can't receive it many of you have asked me many questions i told you it's not for you if you can't accept it if you can't accept it it's not for you but if you can accept it then deal with that between you and god why because grace is not to be dis stowed out as a blanket it's an individual affair see whether it be grace for the soul or whether it be grace for the entire and i'll make a life statement without the grace i believe of the marriage and divorce situation that the prophet brought in the last days i'll quote the scripture that would say there would be no flesh saved i don't care how good you think you are or what you've been then there'd be no flesh saved so to make sure there's going to be something safe he's in the grace for those who can take that accept it but i don't like for people to use grace in any form to try to prop up you know what i mean well it's all right because of it winds up like i told you about that man at work that was telling me about god baptized jesus come and baptized his wife in the hospital bed because he didn't know where she's going to live or not so he no that's his word i thought that's kind of funny but you know he said god didn't know where she's going to live or not so he come down and baptized her right there in the bed i thought okay so i asked him a simple question most of you know i said let's turn this thing around now that was my wife laying in the hospital bed and i'm telling you the story i'm telling you god come down in that hospital room and baptize my wife i said would you believe that he said no he had a wife it was a woman preacher i never met her never met her never didn't have to worry about it but she's a warmer preacher why because she had him under her thumb i ain't quite that blind my wife come tell me god come down baptize her in the bed i just tell her say honey you don't need a bass saturday you got your saturday bath but that's all you got you don't believe that to be done i don't believe you'll prop it up right it'll be right okay let's get through we're done before we end anybody have a need or something to be prayed for come up and let's pray and then we'll just go right on into the service and bring up everything and get everything done from here we're only going to have one service today so we don't have to be in no big hurry you know and all and we appreciate before i forget it to everybody of what you're doing the jobs you've done the things you've done the little bitty things god sees all of the things the little bitty things he sees them and now remember we're human as we try to uh do everything and we may miss somebody in their doings but but don't come up and say well well i i i done one time see that's not exactly what we're trying to we're trying to cover offices you know well i did that one time well come behind the pulpit and i'll give you 20 bucks to forget it i'm not going to be no argument with nobody i'm just going to try to put it in the right order and to do the best we can all right does anybody need any prayer for anything if not then we will go right on into the providing the thing
