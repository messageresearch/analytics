========================================

God bless you Saints good morning we sure enjoyed the service yesterday and looking for more this today um I want to continue our journey through the book of um First Corinthians and looking at um chapter 4 um and I just took a one of the things Paul will saying in that in that chapter is judging nothing before the time so just uh maybe frame things up around that um let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful for your word that You' given un to us in this hour to give us understanding and confidence Lord I pray God that Lord as we've come with expecting Hearts today Lord Jesus you'll give us what we have need of Lord help us Lord that you'll give us something to help and I pray God that as we walk through these scriptures Lord you'll guide us Lord we can read the words Lord but it takes the Holy Spirit to put it together and put the true essence of the meaning together and lift it off the page I pray God that you'll do that for us this morning be with us we pray as we give give everything that give the service to you Lord we pray in your name amen oh and that says second Corinthians but that's a typo I just noticed it so it says in verse five just to backtrack a little bit he saying who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man I have planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he the that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase now really to frame up where Paul's going he's saying you know don't look at men look at the word but he's he's leading us to where he he's going to get to that statement follow me is also I follow Christ so it's kind of it's kind of odd he's he's really hammering don't look at the man look at the word but then then he leads up to follow me as also I follow Christ what what Paul I thought you were just saying don't look at a man but he's he's he's framing things up to say look you don't you we're supposed to live a life of of sacrifice and humility where we're we're not trying to get people to look at us we're trying to trying to guide them to to Christ and so he's saying he's framing it up as we follow the progression along that it's all about Jesus Christ so you know look he's saying look you look at my life as a template of what a Christian should be being lowered in a basket over the wall sacrific and being ready to die for for the what he believes and all of those kind of things but really it's it's all about Jesus Christ not about any particular man so he's saying Apollos watered and and I planted but but it's it's really God that it that is doing everything behind the scenes uh so now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor and then verse n he says for we are laborers together with God for year God's husbandry in other words it's like a it's like a plant that God is is is constantly tending and and he's and he's got ministers to trim and and and fertilize and do all the things to make sure that it's growing up and and then and then he says you're God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I've laid the foundation and as we looked at uh the last time I was speaking he he literally laid the foundation of of of all the things that we're we're we're preaching even now is because he he laid the foundation in the very first church age and that like that Faith Foundation of Ephesus that the whole building is built upon I've laid the foundation and another build their own but let every man take heed how he builth thereupon for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now that's something to think about that that you know as we're as we're preaching the word and as we're laboring and and doing things for Christ that you know you can kind of get off the off the track so to speak and and start laying Things based on your own opinion and based on your own desires and based on your own motives and objectives and then those things will be wrong and and then later on you know the the the fire the test of life will come along and anything that's not laid correctly will actually be consumed and and Paul's laying out here in the the next few scriptures you you you'll still have have your salvation if you don't build correctly but anything that's built with the wrong motives and the wrong objectives the the fires and the testings of life and things will consume it until at the end if you all the things that are not built correctly will be consumed and and and and be eaten up so he said now in verse 12 he said now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it so you know wood and hay and stubble are things that are easily it's easy to catch it on fire the fire of Life the the testing time comes and and it just burns up until you know you you you you out in the yard and you burn leaves and and after you're done there's nothing left and and that's what if you don't if you don't build things right with the right motives and the right and building upon uh uh the revelation of Jesus Christ then it it will not it will not stand the testing time Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the days shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built there upon he shall receive reward what kind of rewards maybe you frame it up like this recognition honor responsibilities uh integrity and and and and and people admiring the the stand that you take for the gospel and looking to you like Paul and saying well he's the kind of the Temple that I would want to frame my life after I want to I want to follow somebody like him because I believe that he's following Jesus Christ but if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so is by fire so if we were to frame that up maybe another way if any man's work is burned up by the test he'll suffer the loss of his reward yet he himself will be saved but only as one who has barely escaped through fire so gold and silver and precious stones represent works of Eternal value done with the right motives in obedience to God's Will and for his glory and wood and hay and stubble represent works of lesser or no Eternal value actions driven by selfish motives just trying to get some money or trying to get some popularity or something like that Disobedience or temporal priorities all of those things will just be consumed and will have no lasting value oh but what has lasting value is the word of God and if we build life and built our but if we frame our try to frame our character and everything that's about us upon the word of God then that will last forever that will last forever so Paul's he's framing out he said know know you not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are now he's he's framing it up in the next chapter he's he's fixing to start whooping them for uh for not caring about that brother in that that's committing fornication so he's he's like don't you realize that your temple now now really think about this that if you really recognize that your body is is is is where God is dwelling then that it's it's like a call to live in a manner worthy of hosting the divine presence that our whole life should be frame AED up to be in in Holiness to live a holy life to not to not look at things that you shouldn't do to not to not eat like watching things that or you know giving your time to things that are not holy because to think now that God is tabernacling in you that he's living in you and and so you know uh I've got the little note here Believers as temples are also considered to be a holy priesthood tasked with offering spiritual sacrifice is acceptable go to God which involves ongoing worship and dedication to God so if you're a holy priesthood you're going to be offering sacrifices you're going to be sacrificing your time in prayer and study and you're going to be sacrificing sacrificing your uh your uh you know when you get up on the morning and sun on Sunday and you don't feel so much like rolling out of the bed and getting getting to church on maybe on Wednesday night but because you're a you're a holy priesthood you're sacrificing yourself and you're like I'm I'm laying down my own will and I'm going to do what uh what what God's word requires and all of this is framed up in the fact that that you are temple of God that God is God is tabernacling in you or or wants to at least and so that frames up everything that that you should uh we should live our lives in a manner that is worthy of Hosting God in our in our vessel and then he said know you not that you are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God so what defilement means that that you know if you if you start going down that wrong path of giving your mind to things that are not right uh of of neglecting your prayer and your your a holy life then it starts lead it's like you know I've got this little picture here of of a temple where it just starts getting overgrown and moth starts taking over and dirt after a while it it it's like it doesn't look holy anymore so defilement will lead it leads to spiritual separation right or a loss of the divine presence and blessings you start you start acting wrong and doing wrong and and not studying and not not giving yourself to God and slowly things the world starts creeping in until you get more further and further away from God and and and and and you know you you you don't feel his presence anymore and oh if you're in that state this morning maybe it's time to change time to time to get get things a little bit cleaned up like Jesus went into the temple platted the rope and went in there and began to he said you my my temple is supposed to be holy and and you know if that Temple was supposed to be holy how much more your temple your temple is supposed to be holy and cleaned up and not given to like what Paul's getting to and not given to fornication and not given to the the filth of the world and all of those things don't let any of those things come into or have an influence over your temple which is supposed to be set apart for God and then and so he keep going on he said therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether Paul or Apollos or sephus now now this is kind of what Paul Peter was saying some of the things Paul says is kind of hard to understand all things are yours elaborate on that Paul Paul didn't he just says it real quick throws it out there and and you to to make you think sit on it and think about it let no man glory in men for all things are yours and now what that means is he's admonishing the Corinthians to stop boasting about or exalting their human leaders because all things are yours because he's saying that Believers have this immense spiritual inheritance in Christ Christ that everything that God has provided is for your benefit but if you're looking at the person instead of the word then you're losing sight of all those benefits that you have access to right whether Paul or Apollos or sephus or the world or life or death or present or things present or things to come all are yours eternal life the benefits that David talked about in Psalms healing and salvation and all those things but you get so wound up on on following a person person looking at the person in other word well to frame it up like this if you if you start getting your identity for from a man instead of from the word of God then that's where you get off base and you are Christ and Christ is God's so let no man glory in men for all things are yours now that's that's kind of profound if you really sit and think about that all things are yours everything everything this Bible talks about from Genesis to Revelation like like brother Brandon was was just saying in that sermon we were listening to it's already paid for so if you need healing it's already paid for now that's what Paul's expressing here all things are yours so if you need healing or salvation or a refreshing of the of the spirit of God in your life this morning it's already paid for and it's available for you so going on to 1 Corinthians chapter 4 let a man so count of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the Mysteries of God moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of M man's judgment yay I judge not my own self to be found faithful he's talking about a minister should be found faithful means stay true to the gospel and consistently teaching and living out God's word and serve with integrity and dedication to God not for personal gain or recognition and all those things but he's saying now now look I I I can have my own opinion about myself now now this this is where every one of us in this building kind of it it we struggle with this because every one of us when we evaluate ourselves we have this tendency to say well I'm I'm good I I'm the one that's doing it right I I'm I'm the one that's behaving correctly or what it's the other guy that's that's got the fault but what's Paul saying he's taking this real humble approach with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment he's saying I I don't even judge my own self what's our judge our judge is not our own opinion or our own our own uh uh uh how how we think of ourselves but you got to take everything back to the word of God that's right look what he's saying he said I want to be found faithful I I don't want to compromise or distort the word or I want to constantly consistently teach and and serve with integrity and dedication and give my life lay down my life but but the the ultimate metric of your success is not our own opinion because if I just look at my own opinion I'm I'm doing pretty good but but when you know when you come to church it's it or when you look into the Bible you're holding up your life to the mirror of God's word and that's where a lot of times we'll go oh me oh oh my right you hold up yourself to the word of God like like Paul is doing to the Corinthians He he'll say later on you're all puffed up you're arrogant in your mind because you think you think that you're doing good you think and he would say when dealing with this man that's committing fornication you're all puffed up because you think that you're right to allow this man just to continue doing his thing and living wrong but but yet they're not evaluating themselves by the word of God so he's holding the word of God up to them and saying look look what you're doing look at yourself now that's that's that's when things get real is when we look into the word of God and say wow I'm not measuring up the way that I thought I was so he's saying in verse four he says for I know nothing by myself I I I don't know anything by myself just looking at my own self by my own opinion or what I think what I think I am yet am I I not hereby Justified but he that judgeth me is the Lord right so true justification comes from God not from self-perception or human opinions now now this is we're getting into the thought of Judge not before the time because we can be so quick maybe to judge our own s or so quick to judge somebody else right when you don't really see the hidden motive and what's really down underneath the covers sometimes you know we can look at we can see the reaction of someone's spirit or their flesh their actions but to really uncover what someone's real motives are and what their what's really down underneath sometimes takes time so the truth of the matter is God gets to say if it's good or bad if it passes the test or if it fails the test and he always judges by the word God will bring to light so in verse 5 he says therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have Praise of God so in other words God will bring to light hidden things and intentions of the heart now if if you notice that he's he's timeing it to the to the Lord's coming because the coming of the Lord is actually associated with the revealing of all these things the revealing of uh like how would without the Seven Seals being revealed how would you really be able to differentiate or know the difference between that Antichrist Spirit and the real the real genuine lion Spirit it begins to reveal things so that you can really see the difference so the revelation of hidden things is intricately connected to the Lord's return this is when what is hidden in darkness will be brought to light and the true intentions or counsels of Hearts will be man manifest in another word we call it man we sing that song manifesting time so therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come what what what what do we take away from this that human judgment is inherently flawed due to our limited understanding right now that's the thing that we all battle with I I think I got it all figured out but 90 time nine times out of 10 we don't I think I got it all figured out what what's going on don't make Hasty conclusions about right and wrong based on superficial appearances right true understanding or judgment is revealed in God's timing and through spiritual maturity Guided by the Holy Spirit now now that that's a lesson for even understanding scripture like brother Brandon when he was preaching the seals he said it's gone from you you don't understand it and and he and then you we struggle I'm I'm going to do it I'm I'm going to figure it out but you you can't there's a time and a season you just wait you wait and God will reveal things in his time so therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come and then he'll bring hidden things of darkness and manifest everything some truths or judgment are only comprehensible when revealed by God highlighting the importance of waiting for for divine Insight just wait so we're not here to judge the man but but we are here to hold each other accountable to the word so what what we take away from this is to maintain patience avoid premature judgments and live lives aligned with the word nurturing the wisdom to discern Beyond superficial appearances and actions right now you see Paul's taking this approach when he's dealing with the Corinthians he he calls them his brothers he calls them Christian yet they're dealing doing things they shouldn't be doing you you you you you you're he's not just throwing them out saying well you know that's a Judas or that's a that's an ananas or that whatever you know label putting those labels on those hateful labels but just just wait maintain patience avoid premature judgments and then he's dealing with them so that you know that that brother that he's dealing with that was committing fornication there in second Corinthians he straightens everything up the church straightens up the ones that are all puffed up they get realigned they get humble themselves and and everything fall aligns right back with the word in verse six he said in these things brother and I have an a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos in other words in a figure in another like an example I'm using myself and Apollos as an example for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another believer should not Elevate any person including themselves beyond the guidance provided by scriptures amen now that's that's a real lesson in humility because we want to puff oursel up we want to elevate oursel up and be like I'm I'm right and you're wrong and and and and but but Philippians 2 chapter 2:3 says let's esteem other better than themselves that's that's getting on up to brotherly kindness where you can start placing yourself in the other person's shoes and look at them things from their perspective I think well if I was in their shoes I'd probably look at things a little bit different and and then we wouldn't be so quick to judge and put the other down right for who maketh thee to differ from one another and what hast thou that thou do not received I got this picture of the little baby because everything in life that you got you got from somebody and you come into this world naked and without nothing and and just hitting the ground the way you started off somebody had to give you a blanket somebody had to give you a little whack on the back to get you started everything that you've got you had to receive from somebody now if thou did receive it why do thou Glory as if thou Hast not received it so that that really puts us in a place doesn't it that that if you got the Holy Ghost it's not something you gave to yourself but you got it from God if if you got everything that you got you got from somebody else so that really puts us all on one common Baseline that not one of us is better than the other not one of us can get puffed up and Elevate ourselves and say well uh praise God look at me I I'm this or I'm that who maketh the to differ from one from another and what has thou that thou this receive so we're all different but I differences shouldn't lead to Pride we are all equally dependent on God we all got a place in the body of Christ where you know like like Paul would say in that one place he said there's diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administrations but the same Lord and diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all in one place he said there's helps in the body of Christ right that that some people are just better Cooks than others some people are better better help you can go some people can minister to somebody in a different way than others can and we've all got that special part in the body of Christ that we're meant to play and that's where we get our value now look what he said now in verse eight to really understand what Paul's saying here you got he's he being a little sarcastic he's like now now you're full now you're rich look at all this stuff y'all got and we could really apply that to our own life us us lay out ofans we got uh we driving these fancy cars and we could say well now you're R you're full now you're R look at all you got you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God you did reain that we also might rign with you because if if if the if the church is prospering and everybody's driving their big fancy cars and if Paul is here you can say well I I I I I I I would that you reain so that I I could rain with you but he's framing it up like what is a real Christian Life as we as we close here in just a moment a real Christian Life is humility and sacrifice and giving yourself to others not not building up wealth and popularity so everybody can look at you and say well wow I really admire that person as a and and so forth and so on but he said so he says now you are full now you are rich you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God you did Reign that we also might reign with you for I think that God has set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle under the world and angels and to Men We are fools for Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ we are weak but you are strong you are honorable but we are despised even under this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and buffeted and have no certain dwelling place and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things under this day I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Holy Ghost through the through the gospel what's he saying true leadership and Spiritual Authority come through humility and sacrifice not Earthly success or recognition all all the things that the apostles went through hunger and thirst and persecution show their commitment to Christ and their Reliance on God so Paul's challenging the Corinthians to move beyond their current immaturity and and you'll find as he's laying this out and in all of Paul's writings that suffering is linked to character development and spiritual maturity what's he trying to express to the Corinthians I I want to see some character right you know Mar in that sermon marriage and divorce that we shy away from brother randam said God wants to see character it's about character amen and we'll just stop on that note God bless you Saints am [Applause]
