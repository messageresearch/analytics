[24:45] these things just have your way lead us
[24:48] in thine understanding forgive our sins
[24:51] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[24:53] just let your love be made manifest in
[24:55] each one of our hearts and lives we need
[24:58] you so much we just commit everything
[25:00] now to you as we read your word you come
[25:02] and speak to our hearts and give us
[25:05] understanding ears lead us and keep us
[25:07] in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've
[25:12] been on that one for quite a while but
[25:15] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:17] right amen the revelation of Jesus
[25:19] Christ which God gave unto him to sh un
[25:21] his servants things which must shortly
[25:23] come to pass and he sent and signify it
[25:26] by his Angel and his John who by record
[25:29] of the word of God and the testimony of
[25:31] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[25:33] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[25:36] that hear the words of this prophecy
[25:39] keep those things which are written
[25:41] therein for that time is at hand
[25:44] Revelations
[25:46] 13 verse 11 and I beheld another Beast
[25:49] coming up out of the earth and he had
[25:52] two horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[25:54] dragon and he exerciseth all the power
[25:57] of the first Beast before him and
[25:59] causeth the Earth and them which DW
[26:01] dwell therein to worship the first Beast
[26:03] whose deadly wound was healed and he
[26:06] doeth great wonders so that he maketh
[26:08] Fire come down from heaven on the earth
[26:11] in the sight of men and deceiveth them
[26:14] that dwell on the Earth by the means of
[26:16] those Miracles which he had power to do
[26:19] in the sight of the Beast saying unto
[26:21] them that dwell on the earth that they
[26:24] should make an image to the Beast which
[26:26] had the wound
[26:31] which had the wound by a sword and did
[26:33] live now remember what we were saying
[26:35] this morning
[26:37] that it's not great
[26:40] Miracles that he was able to
[26:43] perform or this image of the Beast is
[26:46] able to perform you know it's not
[26:49] dealing like that it's the atomic and
[26:51] the things like that but now also
[26:54] remember that the
[26:56] anointing mhm is poured
[26:59] out in this last days right so then who
[27:03] is all of these people that are that are
[27:06] are going out in healings and signs and
[27:09] wonders and miracles taking
[27:12] place and certainly not the
[27:15] devil and it's God permitting that to
[27:18] happen right all right so then it goes
[27:20] from the
[27:21] natural in this day into the
[27:24] supernatural amen that we're not saying
[27:26] that those people out there that that
[27:28] they pray for the sick I remember
[27:30] stating at one time about it you know
[27:32] that and it really DED on me that
[27:34] brother brand said that God wouldn't
[27:36] hear a shorthaired woman but yet you see
[27:39] them out here on the internets and
[27:40] things praying for people and miracles
[27:43] are happening and everything that's a
[27:46] gift right the person if it took away
[27:49] the gift it'd be nothing right so he's
[27:51] not hearing the short- haired woman he's
[27:52] hearing the gift that's right you see
[27:55] that's what he's doing here what we're
[27:56] talking and and deceive them cuz he had
[27:59] power to do what God permits
[28:03] that now why did he permit
[28:06] it to try you and I right right yep is
[28:10] that scripture we preached on that
[28:12] before it's to try you and I that's
[28:15] right God allows these things to come
[28:17] among us to see whether we're going to
[28:20] stay with the truth or not amen cuz
[28:22] we're down here in the time of the image
[28:24] of the Beast right you say well would
[28:26] God do that
[28:29] you come and explain to me that he
[28:31] hadn't done it right now you know I mean
[28:33] you you tell me so well I know this
[28:35] person over here that they're they're
[28:37] all kind of different things you know
[28:39] and they're all demon possessed seem
[28:41] like but they can pray and and healings
[28:43] will take place well you tell me who
[28:45] does the
[28:48] healing God permits that to try you and
[28:51] I to see what we'll do all
[28:56] right
[28:57] and he had power to give life unto the
[29:00] image of the
[29:01] Beast that the image of the Beast should
[29:04] both speak and calls that as many as
[29:07] would not worship the image of the Beast
[29:09] should be killed that's pretty powerful
[29:11] isn't it and he calls us all both small
[29:14] and great rich and poor free and bond to
[29:17] receive a mark in their right hand hand
[29:20] are in their
[29:21] fourheads and that no man might buy or
[29:24] sell say he that had to Mark or the name
[29:27] of the Beast are the number of his name
[29:30] here is
[29:31] wisdom that him that hath understanding
[29:35] count the number of the Beast where is
[29:37] the number of a man and his number is
[29:40] 666 you may be seated Lord has blessing
[29:44] now let me say this part in case I don't
[29:47] get back to
[29:52] it I'm glad the scripture States it the
[29:55] way it
[29:56] does it says he that hath
[29:59] wisdom right right now if you
[30:04] remember
[30:06] Solomon one of the wisest of all
[30:11] men he didn't pray for
[30:15] knowledge
[30:19] understanding he wanted wisdom right you
[30:23] said well that's the same word well why
[30:26] would the Bible use it in the same
[30:27] sentence right if it's the same word
[30:30] right
[30:31] you see wisdom is really to know how to
[30:34] use your
[30:36] understanding right amen it's to know
[30:39] how to use it know what it is Solomon
[30:42] was a great wise
[30:45] man he knew that but he knew that was
[30:49] not what he wanted he knew now I'm just
[30:51] stating what I believe I believe he knew
[30:54] that he could lead to
[30:56] people he had followed David he had seen
[30:59] what would transpire he knew all of the
[31:02] things in
[31:06] life but he knew that wasn't what he
[31:08] needed right he knew now listen to what
[31:11] I'm saying he knew that was the thing
[31:14] that David didn't have
[31:18] right David had a great understanding he
[31:20] was a great ruler he was a great
[31:24] king but he just didn't have wisdom
[31:28] right he let it get eat up in the bases
[31:30] of things around and you
[31:34] know if David had just prayed for wisdom
[31:37] look what it would have been so do you
[31:39] and I want understanding and
[31:42] understanding you know we try to be
[31:45] right we've got to have understanding
[31:47] before it can turn into
[31:50] wisdom it's got to be something that
[31:52] would tell us you know and lead us right
[31:55] in other words we we're reading it right
[31:56] out of the the book that's
[31:59] understanding but I want wisdom yes the
[32:03] prayer that I've always prayed here is
[32:05] as long as I've been pastors Lord give
[32:07] me wisdom
[32:09] right understanding is fine but give me
[32:12] wisdom amen and then a lot of times you
[32:14] might not agree and a lot of times I
[32:16] don't agree with the way that I do
[32:21] things but I pray and I try to seek God
[32:25] and I try to have wisdom
[32:28] and you know sometimes it's all right
[32:31] and sometimes it's my understanding I'm
[32:33] pretty sure but still that's what I want
[32:36] is wisdom so I want to get that part in
[32:38] case we don't get back to it because
[32:40] this is not just dealing with the
[32:42] Antichrist and seeing what all of these
[32:44] things are it's dealing with the basis
[32:49] of knowing what God wants right I see it
[32:53] doing what God wants brother Aon I think
[32:55] you need to Clicker so we on the AC
[32:58] we've got the new part and we got too
[33:01] much of a gap between the heater and the
[33:03] AC everybody's standing so come up and
[33:06] take care of the the doings get a little
[33:10] AC
[33:11] running he knows how to bypass all of
[33:14] this stuff and do whatever we have need
[33:15] of but now listen what did we talk about
[33:19] this morning we talk about the more I
[33:21] was trying to get into it but more of
[33:23] the image unto the Beast all right an
[33:28] exact likeness made in the
[33:33] people but now I I want to try to
[33:36] explain it this way cuz I got a question
[33:38] and I want to cover the
[33:40] question and uh I want you to think
[33:44] about it this
[33:47] way we can have
[33:50] great understanding in our
[33:53] forehead all
[33:55] right and we can call that
[33:59] wisdom but the real wisdom I want is
[34:02] from the heart amen do you understand me
[34:06] that's what I think we need more than
[34:09] anything we we we've got the message
[34:12] we've got the ability to study it we've
[34:14] got the computers to run and search the
[34:17] quotes that we didn't have in the early
[34:20] years but we need wisdom see coming from
[34:23] that inward part of
[34:25] us all right and that's where I made the
[34:28] statement and then a question was asked
[34:30] about it I made the statement and I
[34:33] believe it that Martin
[34:36] Luther he was a born again
[34:39] Christian he had the new birth I believe
[34:43] that sure Amen in his soul his soul was
[34:46] perfectly pure right but yet he was a
[34:53] trinitarian Wesley was a great man of
[34:56] God
[34:57] great
[34:58] truth but yet he was a trinitarian right
[35:02] right ausa Street
[35:06] Pentecost was a great opportunity for
[35:08] the Holy Ghost to come back working in
[35:10] the
[35:12] people but yet they were trinitarian
[35:14] that's right amen see your W this didn't
[35:16] start till about somewhere around 1912
[35:19] or 14 or something that's right and then
[35:21] it even took the people into the wrong
[35:23] Avenue
[35:25] yep well I believe those people down
[35:27] through there not everybody because I
[35:30] don't believe everybody in the days of
[35:32] Martin Luther had the new birth but I
[35:34] don't believe everybody today has the
[35:35] new birth righten but I believe that
[35:38] some had a new birth in the days of
[35:40] Martin Luther but yet they were caught
[35:42] in that doctrinal thing and the question
[35:45] was how could you have
[35:47] a the Holy Ghost inside of
[35:50] you and yet you could have a
[35:53] denominational idea or thought or
[35:59] well the best way I guess to express
[36:02] that to me
[36:04] is just because you got the new birth
[36:06] doesn't mean you know
[36:09] everything that's right all right many
[36:12] of you may be claimed a new birth for a
[36:14] long
[36:17] time I believe I received a new birth in
[36:21] 1969 so that would put me a a long ways
[36:24] end to that point but you know what I
[36:28] admit to you that I don't have all the
[36:32] answers
[36:34] right see because I still have my
[36:36] carnality of my mind that I must deal
[36:41] with and only the opening of the word
[36:45] that's right the revealing of the word
[36:46] can take away our carnality right amen
[36:49] now understanding wise we may have
[36:52] it but that's out in your intellectual
[36:55] realm of memory reason conscience
[36:58] affections through your
[37:00] brain I said through your brain because
[37:02] your brain is not just your spirit right
[37:05] it is your brain it's a storage
[37:08] mechanism it's a place to that has to be
[37:11] dealt
[37:13] with but yet still even right now you'd
[37:17] say well brother Dale I have questions
[37:20] about one
[37:22] God all right but you claim a new birth
[37:25] mhm right right you say you're born
[37:28] again but see just because you're born
[37:31] again that only puts the new birth in
[37:33] the soul
[37:35] right you say well I'm just a unit
[37:39] well all right go ahead with your
[37:43] unit but just
[37:45] remember there was a day you didn't know
[37:47] a lot of answers that you know right
[37:50] right amen but yet you claimed the new
[37:53] birth right that's right you say you're
[37:56] born born again but you don't have a lot
[37:57] of answers well how come you don't have
[37:59] all the answers
[38:01] right because that there's a separation
[38:05] between the soul of an individual and I
[38:08] know that I've said this and people
[38:10] don't understand me Brother Gary he back
[38:12] there he he he talked with me a little
[38:15] bit about it
[38:18] but I wish that that inward man of me
[38:21] would do all of the
[38:22] thinking and all of the talking right
[38:25] man in all of the doings don't you amen
[38:29] I wish that everything inside of me was
[38:31] coming outwardly to wor that it could
[38:34] make it
[38:35] manifest but a lot of times it's not and
[38:39] I'm still just trapped in that basis of
[38:41] being Body Spirit and soul now you'd
[38:44] agree brother brandom was Bor a born
[38:46] again Christian and a prophet right but
[38:50] yet he said one day like this he said I
[38:52] used to think that Jesus loved me and
[38:55] God hated me
[38:57] right now where was that at it was not
[39:00] in his soul right because it could not
[39:03] have been something that God came up
[39:06] with so it was the human element right
[39:09] of a
[39:11] man in his memories reasonings and
[39:14] things developing through his
[39:16] intellectual part of him called the
[39:18] brain and you're not born again in your
[39:21] brain right I wish we could I heard a
[39:25] man one time say that we need a baptism
[39:27] of the Holy Ghost in our brain and I
[39:29] amen I I believe it we need a cleansing
[39:34] of our brain right amen the day you got
[39:37] born again did it stop your brain from
[39:39] working did it change the gear you know
[39:42] and it shift over and and all at once
[39:44] you started thinking good and right no
[39:48] right no that didn't happen might
[39:50] happened for a little while right in the
[39:53] beginning but then after a while here
[39:55] com that old devil
[39:57] mhm and Martin
[40:00] Luther he was a
[40:02] trinitarian yet I believe he was a born
[40:05] again
[40:05] Christian I believe he had all of God
[40:08] for the day that could be had you know
[40:11] what I
[40:12] mean but yet he didn't have all the
[40:15] answers I believe you can be a born
[40:17] again
[40:19] Christian I believe you can be up the
[40:21] stature of a perfect man back to where
[40:24] the disciples were
[40:28] and still
[40:30] have problems in our memory reason
[40:33] conscience things through our brain
[40:36] through the mechanism of us right I'll
[40:38] even go further I believe you can be a c
[40:41] off Born Again adopted
[40:45] individual and still have trouble M
[40:49] right now if you don't believe that then
[40:50] you better listen to brother Brandon
[40:52] right y because I believe he was that
[40:55] form of an IND individual don't you I
[40:58] believe he was adoped off capped off
[41:01] manifested headstone filled Holy Ghost
[41:05] person yep right but yet seemingly in
[41:09] his latter days he was having
[41:11] more
[41:13] struggles right and
[41:17] problems and you say well he learned
[41:19] everything well according to
[41:21] him that's not true because he would say
[41:25] I I just got this yesterday right so
[41:28] that meant the day before he didn't have
[41:30] the
[41:31] answer the day before he was confused in
[41:34] his
[41:34] thoughts all right so I believe you can
[41:38] be a born again
[41:40] Christian and still have ideas and
[41:43] things that are contrary to God
[41:45] Amen because that means of lack of
[41:49] understanding
[41:50] now let me say it this way and without
[41:54] offense to people outside of the this
[42:01] church if you didn't have very much
[42:04] understanding right you better consider
[42:06] the fact of where you're at right
[42:09] amen because if you're still toying over
[42:12] whether there's one God two Gods three
[42:15] Gods River Jordan Gods Two Souls seven
[42:19] under vir perusia y if you're still
[42:23] toying over those things to wonder if
[42:25] they're true or not yeah come on I
[42:28] definitely will tell you that I do not
[42:29] believe it's in your soul that's born
[42:31] again right it might be in your soul but
[42:35] that's where I check it out cu you see
[42:38] it's not my God don't approach me it has
[42:41] to come through this thing right he
[42:43] comes through my ears it's like yours he
[42:45] comes through our thinking right all of
[42:47] that but
[42:51] yet you can be born again and still have
[42:55] problems
[42:58] right you can be born
[43:01] again and still think
[43:05] wrong but now your soul can't right cuz
[43:09] it's sealed
[43:12] in that's what I want us to think about
[43:15] the see the mark of the beast as I've
[43:17] said this morning and we'll try to read
[43:19] some coming
[43:20] down
[43:22] is if you're not born again you're
[43:24] already marked with the mark of the be
[43:27] people are scared about it and wondering
[43:29] about the mark of the
[43:30] beast well I'm afraid I might take I you
[43:34] know they would even tell us I I you
[43:36] know if you're talking to somebody and
[43:37] say well well I'm afraid that might be a
[43:40] mark of the
[43:41] beast because it's something contrary to
[43:45] them there's a lot of people comes to
[43:48] your door knocks on your door right and
[43:50] they'll give you material but you try to
[43:52] give them
[43:54] some they
[43:56] tell you we're not allowed to read that
[43:58] that's right well I'm not allowed to
[44:00] read yours right if you're not allowed
[44:02] to read
[44:04] mine anything else we sit down together
[44:07] and we'll read yours and then we'll read
[44:09] mine they're not going to do
[44:13] that but what about the world today that
[44:16] was what I was trying to get across this
[44:18] morning what about a world that is
[44:21] already marked by the mark of the beast
[44:23] right now there's things to come that
[44:27] will transpire we're not in this
[44:30] position or situation to where that uh
[44:33] you know you can't buy or
[44:35] sale without the mark of the
[44:37] beast we're not in that situation as of
[44:41] yet but how how much would it
[44:46] take to change it that's right
[44:51] right like a man told way he heard him
[44:54] telling it
[44:57] he said I can delete your name in any
[45:03] time what about somebody with that
[45:05] capability through the computer system
[45:07] that could remove your name from records
[45:14] Y how about going in and try to buy
[45:17] something and they say uh what is your
[45:20] telephone
[45:23] number you try to give out your number
[45:26] and they said that number doesn't exist
[45:28] right according to our records the
[45:30] person who owned that number is no
[45:32] longer
[45:33] alive
[45:35] right you said that can't be done go
[45:37] down to the bank and withdraw your money
[45:40] from the
[45:41] bank when they have deleted your
[45:44] material from it you your name your your
[45:50] uh
[45:52] deing you said but but that's that's and
[45:55] I know what that I'm thinking that'll be
[45:58] on down F and I'm thinking that the big
[46:01] mark of the beast and where you can't
[46:02] buy or sale I've always believe that we
[46:05] will never go through the tribulation I
[46:08] do not believe that but I believe we can
[46:11] get so close until it's very close right
[46:15] to be at that situation I do not believe
[46:18] and and I'm praying in hoping that we
[46:21] won't be here when you can't buy or sell
[46:23] without the mark of the beast but I say
[46:26] that is very very
[46:28] close to that
[46:32] now all I have to do is a stroke of the
[46:34] pen and it can take
[46:36] place so it's not something to worry
[46:39] about that cuz I'm not concerned about
[46:44] that I'm concerned about us getting
[46:48] ready to be able to withstand the hour
[46:51] that
[46:52] comes and to me that can only be done by
[46:55] the review feeling of the
[46:57] word it's not how good we
[47:00] are although that's wonderful and that's
[47:03] supposed to
[47:07] be but it's whether or not you're born
[47:10] again right cuz I never finished that
[47:13] Revelations uh
[47:16] 138 where it talks about you know that
[47:20] everybody would be deceived
[47:24] right whose names were not written in
[47:26] the L Book of Life the foundation of the
[47:31] world well let me put that on over in
[47:33] the
[47:34] language if my name was written there
[47:37] before the foundation of the world then
[47:40] I'm going to come in this life right to
[47:43] a condition or
[47:44] existence to where that I will accept
[47:48] Jesus Christ as my savior will you agree
[47:50] with that
[47:51] right it won't be that he makes us but
[47:55] we will come come to that place if our
[47:58] names were written written there all
[48:01] right then the Bible said everything
[48:03] will be
[48:06] deceived but see that's the easy
[48:08] takeover that's the
[48:11] easy uh doings how easily it can be
[48:16] done because could you no not throwing
[48:19] off from nobody walk across the street
[48:21] over
[48:22] here and could you preach to them what
[48:24] the mark of the beast is
[48:26] is right that it's a trinitarian
[48:36] Doctrine can you do it with your friends
[48:38] and loved ones that surround
[48:39] you no they don't want to hear it right
[48:42] you know why because they know if they
[48:44] hear so much they're going to have to
[48:46] make a choice right they don't want to
[48:48] make a choice right I'm just talking
[48:52] they don't want to make a
[48:54] choice you know leave me in the way I
[48:58] am mama was a Baptist and I'll be a
[49:01] Baptist too you know well that's all
[49:04] right for
[49:06] mama your mama might have been a born
[49:08] again baptist you
[49:11] MH
[49:14] but what about me and
[49:17] you how easy is it to be marked and I'm
[49:20] trying to establish that in your
[49:22] mind that it's not a tattoo on your
[49:25] forehead it's not a a number wise
[49:29] because as we read it can be either his
[49:32] name or his number y
[49:37] right it's it's not always that stamp
[49:40] thing that's my point MH it can be his
[49:43] name or his number
[49:46] or a doctrinal idea is what it
[49:49] is right right when we still have in our
[49:52] mind and say I'll read to you in a
[49:54] minute Lord the Prophet would say
[49:56] something similar to this and we say
[49:58] bless God it's what I
[50:01] believe you know that's okay if you're
[50:03] right right but if you're right you're
[50:05] not going to have to bless God that's
[50:07] what I
[50:08] Believe come
[50:12] on you're if you're right you're not
[50:14] going to argue with nobody about it
[50:16] you're not going to try to prop it up
[50:18] with bless God this is what I believe
[50:20] well why is the righteous indignation
[50:22] getting stirred up you
[50:24] know see somebody that knows where
[50:27] they're at and what they're doing they
[50:29] not no problem
[50:31] right
[50:33] right I mean you can tell me every day
[50:36] of my life brother Dale you're
[50:37] trinitarian as
[50:38] anybody
[50:40] okay but I'm doing my best to get rid
[50:43] out of it right you
[50:47] know but when you rant and square you
[50:49] know swear and everything it's kind of
[50:51] like when they say that you go down to
[50:53] the insane institution you know and
[50:56] and they ask you if you're crazy and you
[50:58] say no I'm not crazy they put them over
[51:01] here but to the other one you know they
[51:04] say well you crazy so I probably am I
[51:06] act like it a lot of times they said we
[51:08] put them over here to help for them you
[51:10] know well that's about the way we are in
[51:13] our Christian
[51:14] realm a lot of people don't want to talk
[51:17] about what they believe right cuz
[51:19] they're afraid of what they believe
[51:21] right amen we were riding down the road
[51:23] one day talking with some people and
[51:25] this certain sisters she
[51:27] said looked at her husband and
[51:31] said is that what we
[51:35] believe he said that's what we believe
[51:37] but it ain't evidently right
[51:40] right riding up the highway
[51:43] but but now
[51:46] listen how easy it is to have the mark
[51:49] of the beast see what you're looking at
[51:51] when you say mark of the
[51:53] beast what you're looking looking at is
[51:56] the point that's been established in
[51:57] your mind of the mark of the beast as
[52:01] some form of
[52:04] um what a character or a point or a
[52:08] thought in your mind that you know it's
[52:12] going to be a great horrible
[52:14] thing and some kind of number-wise
[52:16] systems and pull out your social
[52:19] security card and and see what's going
[52:23] on you don't get a job without
[52:27] one now we're talking about Workforce we
[52:30] ain't talking about where you smuggle
[52:31] some kind of in right we're talking
[52:33] about the
[52:34] workforce legalized
[52:36] system you can't work without a social
[52:39] security
[52:41] number well see that's even people
[52:43] thought the social security numbers you
[52:45] mark of the beast now that's just a
[52:47] record right what is it now when you
[52:52] go they don't ask you social security
[52:54] number because they're not allowed to
[52:56] only certain officials like Law Officers
[52:59] Banks Etc can ask you for that social
[53:02] security number you don't have to give
[53:04] it when somebody calls you and wants
[53:05] your number out way you ain't going to
[53:07] give it to
[53:08] them but they want to know your
[53:10] telephone
[53:11] number why cuz that's a tracking
[53:17] ability
[53:19] right you go down now to get your
[53:21] driver's
[53:22] license y renewed in the state ofor
[53:26] geia what you got to
[53:33] have four things or you're not going to
[53:36] get your driver's
[53:38] license social security number birth
[53:41] certificate bank statement and two
[53:43] records of stating who you are you know
[53:47] bank statements telephone bills anything
[53:52] many many years ago the uh Records begin
[53:56] to be so perverted until even for you to
[54:00] to deal with I remember this it was
[54:03] better to have a baptismal
[54:06] baptismal record you know most churches
[54:08] have a a record if you baptize them
[54:11] that's greater than your birth
[54:14] certificate CU your birth certificate
[54:16] can be
[54:19] falsified right you see we're looking
[54:22] for something to happen
[54:26] when the prophet of God was telling us
[54:28] it was already there right
[54:32] M you said well what can we
[54:35] do well I'll remind you that one time he
[54:38] said it like this he said if you knew
[54:40] what you had in your pocket you'd take
[54:42] it out and burn it but you know he never
[54:44] did take his out and burn
[54:47] it
[54:49] right so evidently he knew something but
[54:52] he didn't go do it
[54:58] he said keep your homes and take the
[54:59] mark of the beast well he give his home
[55:02] away no he had a place to live in
[55:05] somewhere because it's either rented or
[55:08] owned and there's only two difference in
[55:10] that rented somebody else owned and you
[55:13] pay to live there you know or owned you
[55:17] pay to live there right no you got the
[55:20] same end you just pay a live back you
[55:23] said I own my home you drop down on your
[55:25] payments about 3 months you'll find out
[55:27] right somebody else on you home right
[55:31] see Church we're looking for something
[55:33] to
[55:34] happen when the whole world is set up
[55:37] under the Antichrist system amen mhm
[55:42] thank God for what Freedom we have in
[55:44] America amen
[55:47] right but the very words we use
[55:49] sometimes can be a destructive force to
[55:52] be used against us m
[55:56] M training their military
[55:59] now y
[56:01] to fight on their own
[56:04] grounds
[56:08] right why because it's coming to that
[56:11] amen
[56:13] right now what can you do about these
[56:15] things the one thing you can do is get
[56:17] born again amen and be prepared against
[56:19] today cuz that's the only thing you can
[56:22] right amen you remember years ago when
[56:26] everybody stopped paying
[56:29] taxes I ain't going to pay no more
[56:32] taxes I got my god-given right and I'm
[56:35] not going to pay no more
[56:37] well a lot of them W up paying dearly
[56:40] yeah cuz you'll find out they can get it
[56:43] one way or the
[56:46] other but you see that would be some
[56:49] force of something that was a Martin
[56:51] Luther Day when when they went out
[56:53] because of Luther teaching into the
[56:55] churches and how wrong they were they
[56:57] went out and burned the
[56:59] churches he said brother Dale if you
[57:01] could go to Washington DC and protest
[57:04] these things would you go no
[57:07] why brother r one day is going to march
[57:10] on the White House what he got to go the
[57:12] White House for
[57:16] yeah
[57:20] right I I want him at my house if he's
[57:22] coming right I don't want him at
[57:25] amen
[57:27] right well I'm start this something yeah
[57:31] you going to go up you can't go up there
[57:33] and do that there'll be two witnesses
[57:35] that we're reading out in this
[57:36] tribulation that they're going to
[57:38] protest the Catholic church and the
[57:40] world systems and they're going to get
[57:42] killed and there going to be 144,000
[57:44] placed right in there with them and you
[57:46] know what they're going to be killed for
[57:47] what they believe right
[57:50] Y and it's a sweet granddaddy old fell
[57:53] that's going to give the orders to do it
[57:54] right
[57:57] mhm but see then that way we're not
[57:59] looking for the mark of the beast we're
[58:02] realizing that hey if we're not born
[58:05] again we already have it
[58:08] right that's the word we're born at
[58:11] we're born in Satan's
[58:18] domain and in doing that then we're
[58:21] giving up
[58:22] everything gradually that's right that's
[58:26] it
[58:28] gradually you can't take over America
[58:30] real quick you've got to do some things
[58:32] you got to make them think they're doing
[58:34] it that's right
[58:39] right see there's too many movies
[58:43] made and you know it always what it
[58:45] tickle me was and I remembered it you
[58:51] know it's kind of funny cuz I was
[58:54] laughing at what
[58:56] happened and you know we got this
[58:58] totally demolished in the Korean War I
[59:00] mean in the Vietnam done pretty bad in
[59:03] Korea killed
[59:05] off at least there it was a fight but in
[59:09] Vietnam we really just
[59:11] got wiped out you know just wouldn't
[59:16] nothing but you know it wasn't long
[59:18] after then of John Wayne he started
[59:21] making
[59:23] movies and the war was done
[59:25] over and it was done
[59:28] defeated and John Wayne almost defeated
[59:30] the Viet Kong by
[59:33] itself or what's the other guy's name
[59:36] Rambo was he in Vietnam I get my place
[59:38] is messed up
[59:40] okay you know but get what I mean
[59:45] right we build it up and make it look
[59:47] beautiful we really
[59:49] won
[59:52] you no we didn't win
[59:57] but you see it's the mind right of
[1:00:00] mankind that people are dealing with
[1:00:02] right you notice in your movies
[1:00:06] today that they're more fist
[1:00:10] action and I may get this wrong now I
[1:00:13] always do but there so many seconds of
[1:00:16] your
[1:00:18] mind is all that your mind will keep
[1:00:20] constant
[1:00:23] control and like ever so many minutes in
[1:00:26] a movie now you notice they change
[1:00:29] scenes they'll totally change
[1:00:33] scenes make something fights make
[1:00:35] something move why the mind is losing
[1:00:40] it you're not getting your point
[1:00:44] across so you have to do something to
[1:00:47] click the mind to make it keep working
[1:00:49] in the realm you want it right that's
[1:00:52] just natural Church
[1:00:56] you think of people that could do that
[1:00:57] with the whole movie
[1:01:00] system you think there's not a smarter
[1:01:02] devil devil
[1:01:04] that knows how to manipulate all of our
[1:01:11] minds right you know we want to talk
[1:01:13] about God knowing all that you know what
[1:01:15] Satan knows every thought you're having
[1:01:16] right now sure right just did
[1:01:20] well
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:25] you're playing pity patter in the
[1:01:26] backyard with the devil sitting in the
[1:01:29] church I'm just as guilty as you
[1:01:33] are one brother sat here one time
[1:01:35] figured out how to fix a tractor I think
[1:01:37] it was while I was preaching I said boy
[1:01:39] you really enjoyed that
[1:01:46] then you see Satan's trying to get
[1:01:49] control of our minds cuz he knows that's
[1:01:51] the part of us you remember the prophet
[1:01:53] greatest battle ever fought right God
[1:01:56] chose the heart of
[1:01:58] mankind Satan chose his
[1:02:02] head we're already
[1:02:06] marked it's just a time of coming down
[1:02:09] to the
[1:02:11] Judgment you say well no bless God I
[1:02:13] tell you what I don't have no
[1:02:15] Catholicism in
[1:02:17] me like a brother and I'm not throwing
[1:02:19] off on him I love old brother I remember
[1:02:23] harly made him went to Brother Whit
[1:02:25] years ago
[1:02:27] and they said he would sit I heard of
[1:02:29] him maybe I didn't see him but he'd sit
[1:02:32] up there in them caves for days weeks
[1:02:37] fasting and praying in sackcloth and
[1:02:40] Ashes his favorite thing was patting his
[1:02:43] hand and said there's not one ounce of
[1:02:46] tradition in this whole
[1:02:51] body fasted and prayed for weeks
[1:02:55] at a time brother would be told about
[1:02:58] two sisters one time that fasted 25 days
[1:03:03] out of every
[1:03:09] month not just one every
[1:03:13] month when you presented
[1:03:16] truth what
[1:03:18] happened they presented one God to the
[1:03:20] brother had no answer this he walked out
[1:03:23] of the church
[1:03:26] now what good is his fasting and his
[1:03:29] doings
[1:03:31] right do you understand what I'm trying
[1:03:34] to say
[1:03:37] yes what we believe is the damaging part
[1:03:41] of
[1:03:43] us if it's not truth it will destroy
[1:03:49] us but I got right to think where did
[1:03:51] you get
[1:03:53] it I'm an American
[1:03:57] citizen that's moving out pretty
[1:04:00] fast right they can say anything they
[1:04:03] want to but we can't say what we want to
[1:04:06] you think that's moving out pretty fast
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:10] right you go down here to one of these
[1:04:14] mosque and you're going to take your
[1:04:15] shoes off or you're not going
[1:04:22] in would you let one of them come here
[1:04:25] with a turban on his head and see what
[1:04:27] and that'll probably happen one
[1:04:30] day that we ask him to remove it because
[1:04:33] it's slanderous to us and then we'll be
[1:04:35] in jail because of her yeah hate
[1:04:38] crime
[1:04:40] y but that's all I want to ask the judge
[1:04:42] say your honor would you mean would you
[1:04:44] mind going with me down to a
[1:04:46] mosque let's walk in and let's see where
[1:04:49] you take your shoes off or
[1:04:52] not that's all that ask him but listen
[1:04:55] church just trying to get a
[1:04:59] point what is that Mark of the
[1:05:03] Beast that the world has called it
[1:05:06] everything in the book
[1:05:09] y
[1:05:12] you and yet we are the ones who have
[1:05:14] what is the word for it propagated it or
[1:05:17] brought it into
[1:05:20] being see we Americans has brought that
[1:05:23] thing into being
[1:05:25] cuz we're the image to the Beast
[1:05:31] right we have the same Doctrine you said
[1:05:34] no no no the the Baptist is not
[1:05:44] Catholic there's a lot of good Catholics
[1:05:47] right that probably pray not to Mary but
[1:05:51] pray to Jesus Christ probably more than
[1:05:53] we do
[1:06:01] well God respect a person's way you
[1:06:03] talking brother Dale
[1:06:05] no the choice is
[1:06:08] ours we can have the Seal of God or we
[1:06:11] already have the mark of the
[1:06:13] beast it's our choice
[1:06:16] amen and God will not have to spend
[1:06:19] hours at judgment
[1:06:23] explaining to
[1:06:25] us what made us what we
[1:06:29] are I hope we would be as the prophet
[1:06:31] said a Sinners that he walk across and
[1:06:33] won't even raise his
[1:06:35] head but according to my Bible there
[1:06:37] will be people there that will say I've
[1:06:40] Not I cast out Devils done Mighty
[1:06:41] marvelous things in thy name and all he
[1:06:44] said depart from I never knew you goes
[1:06:47] back to what I said when we were over
[1:06:48] here a while
[1:06:50] ago the great signs and wonders that are
[1:06:53] able to be done
[1:06:58] healings and
[1:07:00] miracles dead being raised all form of
[1:07:03] sicknesses proof of
[1:07:06] Records by people that don't believe
[1:07:09] this
[1:07:10] message are you going to argue with
[1:07:16] him but see that's God allowing that as
[1:07:20] I said to try you and I right to see if
[1:07:23] we're stay with the
[1:07:25] word are we going after their
[1:07:29] signs remember if a man give you a sign
[1:07:31] and it come to pass and you take you to
[1:07:33] another God don't believe him that's
[1:07:36] Bible
[1:07:39] right what are we going to do then let's
[1:07:41] just read a few and get a thought real
[1:07:43] quick
[1:07:44] cuz this is the main thing I want us to
[1:07:47] do so let's go with number 4 a brother
[1:07:49] we jumped over a bunch to to just try to
[1:07:53] get get the thoughts and just get in the
[1:07:55] quotes this afternoon on this mark of
[1:07:57] the beast from the message Mark of the
[1:08:00] Beast
[1:08:05] 54513 paragraph 233 now you see what the
[1:08:08] mark of the beast is it's a mark of
[1:08:13] apostasy now he tells you the
[1:08:16] definition or maybe not what Webster
[1:08:21] says you know of
[1:08:25] apostasy what he's saying it's a person
[1:08:28] who is just thinks that well I belong to
[1:08:34] church I'm just as good as the next
[1:08:37] fell I'm not I belonging to this
[1:08:42] church it's kind of hard he said that
[1:08:44] isn't
[1:08:45] it and you realize where your church
[1:08:48] organization that you're dependent on
[1:08:50] where it come from do you realize
[1:08:54] it's like a pretty good
[1:08:56] person belongs to church goes to this
[1:08:59] church so let's call
[1:09:02] that wronging to Lula
[1:09:09] Church see you get the idea of what it
[1:09:11] is the Bible said he that worships the
[1:09:14] Beast receives his Mark or the letter of
[1:09:17] his name now watch in forehead or hand
[1:09:21] that's knowledge or deed right
[1:09:25] that don't mean you got a big tattoo on
[1:09:27] your
[1:09:28] face it don't have to be that it's not
[1:09:32] talking of the
[1:09:34] outward right it's talking of spiritual
[1:09:41] mhm you watch him and see what he knows
[1:09:44] about the scripture listen to him and
[1:09:47] see where he goes
[1:09:50] too that's what we're that's what you're
[1:09:53] supposed to be a to do that's why you
[1:09:57] study where that when I preach you know
[1:10:00] where I'm going right if any man don't
[1:10:03] have this
[1:10:06] Doctrine there's no light in
[1:10:09] him the Bible said see watch where it
[1:10:13] goes to watch what he
[1:10:15] does he takes you to another God yet he
[1:10:18] can raise the
[1:10:19] dead what are we supposed to do look at
[1:10:22] the next one
[1:10:24] hearing receiving and
[1:10:26] acting
[1:10:28] 1960
[1:10:31] 607 it's heading up in two great things
[1:10:35] coming to the end
[1:10:36] time
[1:10:38] time the mark of the beast and the Seal
[1:10:40] of God the Seal of God any Minister
[1:10:43] knows that the Seal of God is the
[1:10:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's exactly
[1:10:48] right Ephesians 4:30 says G not the holy
[1:10:50] spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto
[1:10:52] till the day of your red Redemption amen
[1:10:55] oh I know you think I'm I act funny but
[1:10:58] maybe I I feel good he said come towards
[1:11:01] end and remember what is the mark of the
[1:11:06] beast and the Seal of
[1:11:09] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:12] what is the mark of the beast is a
[1:11:15] carnal
[1:11:16] Esau to reject that
[1:11:22] Birthright now you
[1:11:25] realize I know the natural story Esau
[1:11:28] went on and lived his life through and
[1:11:30] and was good guy and the brothers got
[1:11:33] along fine you remember when they come
[1:11:34] back and Jacob you know he really
[1:11:37] thought he going to kill him and Esau
[1:11:39] winds up to be a converted we call it
[1:11:41] but now remember the rest of the
[1:11:44] story Esau saw repentance with
[1:11:50] tears never got
[1:11:52] it
[1:11:54] right y why because he rejected the
[1:11:57] birth right right did not Esau we
[1:11:59] bitterly trying to restore that birth
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] again but there was no place of
[1:12:05] repentance when you reject the Holy
[1:12:07] Spirit you seal yourself outside of
[1:12:09] God's
[1:12:11] mercy he said
[1:12:13] amen what about what is the seal then go
[1:12:17] ahead number
[1:12:21] six he taken from El sh preached 1960
[1:12:26] 802 paragraph
[1:12:29] e86 Ephesians 4:30 says G not the Holy
[1:12:32] Spirit whereby you are sealed until the
[1:12:34] day of your Redemption how many knows
[1:12:37] that God's word says the Seal of God is
[1:12:39] the Holy Ghost now and then what is the
[1:12:42] mark of the beast is to reject the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost a mark of
[1:12:47] apostasy now what was his definition of
[1:12:52] apostasy
[1:12:54] you remember that brother Brand's
[1:12:55] definition of
[1:12:57] apostasy that we just read back up above
[1:13:00] there where he's talking about
[1:13:04] apostasy if you saying well I go to
[1:13:08] church what does Brother D want I'm in
[1:13:12] church I'm there more than some
[1:13:15] are I do everything I
[1:13:18] can I believe what he tells me but you
[1:13:22] can be an apostle
[1:13:25] now that's what he calls
[1:13:27] it remember the old days when the
[1:13:29] trumpet the Jubilee year come and the
[1:13:32] trumpet sounded and every slave had a
[1:13:34] right to go free but if he didn't choose
[1:13:36] to go free he was taken to the temple
[1:13:39] and they took an awe and bored a hole in
[1:13:41] his ear and he was marked out for the
[1:13:43] rest of his days and what is it on the
[1:13:47] ear when God calls you to receive the
[1:13:50] Holy Ghost and you refuse it then God
[1:13:54] marks what your ear to where you'll
[1:13:58] never want to try it
[1:14:01] anymore
[1:14:03] see then that's the mark of apostasy and
[1:14:07] in the Bible it says that these last
[1:14:09] days that there' be two classes of
[1:14:12] people one with the mark of God the Seal
[1:14:16] of God what is the
[1:14:20] other you'll never want toosy one is the
[1:14:22] mark got the other one was the mark of
[1:14:25] the the Beast is that right now you're
[1:14:29] wearing one of those marks
[1:14:32] tonight if it's a question lay it up on
[1:14:36] the Platforms in other words if you
[1:14:39] don't know what I'm saying you got one
[1:14:41] or the
[1:14:42] other everybody sitting here today in
[1:14:45] this building that's over the age of
[1:14:48] accountability as one or the other
[1:14:51] right either the mark of the beast yep
[1:14:55] or the Seal of
[1:14:56] God you said when I what minut brother
[1:14:58] Dale I'm Justified and Sanctified you
[1:15:01] ain't born
[1:15:02] again don't make a gray area that you
[1:15:05] can try to float in brother brand didn't
[1:15:08] say they
[1:15:10] stre he said there's two either the mark
[1:15:14] of the beast
[1:15:16] or the Seal of God he didn't say there
[1:15:19] was people that were Justified and
[1:15:21] Sanctified that was good people that's
[1:15:23] all right he did say those things they
[1:15:25] were good but you're still not sealed of
[1:15:28] God
[1:15:29] right might have been in Luther's Wesley
[1:15:32] look at the next
[1:15:34] one the 10 virgins
[1:15:40] 144,000 1960 121 in the morning
[1:15:43] paragraph 3:19 oh I love him don't you
[1:15:46] yes sir oh what is what is the Seal of
[1:15:50] God Holy Ghost what is the mark of the
[1:15:54] beast
[1:15:57] rejected there you
[1:15:59] too one of the two is in us right now
[1:16:02] look at the next
[1:16:05] one this is the mark of the
[1:16:08] beast e75
[1:16:11] 61-1 17 why don't you come to it don't
[1:16:16] be sealed away don't be
[1:16:18] dead believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:21] and be sealed into the kingdom what is
[1:16:23] the mark of the beast to reject the Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost see the borderline what see after
[1:16:29] he once come to the knowledge of the
[1:16:31] truth now if you'll notice that
[1:16:34] scripture there bears a lot of meaning
[1:16:36] if you use it to what I did to start
[1:16:38] with it doesn't say he that come to
[1:16:41] wisdom
[1:16:44] right it says he that come to
[1:16:47] knowledge of the truth all right so what
[1:16:51] is he doing impossible those who were
[1:16:53] once
[1:16:54] enlightened they coming up to the
[1:16:56] knowledge of the truth and seeing that
[1:16:58] they see the truth and see the knowledge
[1:17:01] of it and see it's here and see it
[1:17:04] working see it's right and have a
[1:17:07] knowledge of the truth and it turn right
[1:17:09] turn away again there remaineth no more
[1:17:12] sacrifice for sin I told you about a man
[1:17:15] that I talked to at work one
[1:17:17] time and he said the Lord spoke to him
[1:17:20] and I believe him you Audible
[1:17:24] Voice I believe
[1:17:26] him and told him to water baptism in the
[1:17:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:17:34] correct so I told him I it's your choice
[1:17:37] now it's up to you where to get it done
[1:17:39] or
[1:17:40] not I'm not going to argue with you God
[1:17:43] told you
[1:17:45] right you know if I said God didn't tell
[1:17:47] you he probably got upset with me w't
[1:17:50] tell me off would it because he believ
[1:17:52] God told him
[1:17:53] so he came in one day and he
[1:17:55] said call a man's name and said he
[1:17:58] baptized me over the weekend I said
[1:18:02] wonderful I had a little suspicion
[1:18:06] but he said baptized me both
[1:18:11] ways cuz it was a Baptist preacher that
[1:18:14] baptized him friend of
[1:18:18] mine I said before you say another word
[1:18:21] I'm going to tell you how you got
[1:18:23] baptized you've heard me
[1:18:26] right said he baptized you in the name
[1:18:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ then he baptize
[1:18:31] you in Father Son and Holy
[1:18:33] Ghost he said yes right but I knew he
[1:18:36] would never baptize in Father Son and
[1:18:38] Holy Ghost then the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:18:40] said you never was baptized at
[1:18:43] all man wouldn't talk with me
[1:18:48] anymore see he that cometh to the
[1:18:51] knowledge of the truth he said are you
[1:18:53] condemning him no no he condemn his own
[1:18:55] s don't have anything to do with
[1:18:58] it just illustrating
[1:19:02] it what's the next one now because this
[1:19:04] is the thought thought I wanted to get
[1:19:05] us on which is inside man preaching 53
[1:19:10] 1212 8 the see that I was dealing with
[1:19:13] this this morning I believe it's Ezekiel
[1:19:15] the 9th chapter I'm pretty sure I may be
[1:19:18] wrong I know I'm quite sure it's Ezekiel
[1:19:20] 9 when the Holy Spirit
[1:19:23] went forth from first it was man went
[1:19:27] forth from behind the
[1:19:29] gates with slaughtering weapons to
[1:19:32] destroy that was of course in in the
[1:19:35] scriptural rightly applied but just
[1:19:37] before the destruction of jerus and
[1:19:39] there was a man came forth with a white
[1:19:41] robe and ink horn at his side and the
[1:19:44] commission was given to him by God to go
[1:19:47] through the city now just listen to this
[1:19:50] and set a mark upon the forehead the
[1:19:52] cealing of the Holy Spirit a mark upon
[1:19:55] the forehead of every man or woman that
[1:19:59] sighed and cried for the Abomination
[1:20:01] done in the city now that's what I was
[1:20:04] talking about this
[1:20:09] morning you say well then that looks
[1:20:11] like that we would be saying that the
[1:20:14] Seal of God is in your
[1:20:16] forehead
[1:20:19] remember this was in the Old Testament
[1:20:23] mhm before the Holy Spirit was given
[1:20:26] right so it could not have been the Holy
[1:20:30] Spirit as a new birth
[1:20:33] right are you
[1:20:35] listening it was an example
[1:20:38] right you following it an example was
[1:20:43] given go through and mark them in their
[1:20:51] forehead but you see the Holy Spirit had
[1:20:54] never been given to be able to seal them
[1:20:56] in their heart now it's not sealing in
[1:20:58] your forehead right and sealing in your
[1:21:01] heart but Satan is still after the same
[1:21:03] tactics
[1:21:05] right why because we just got to reading
[1:21:09] this go ahead with number nine we just
[1:21:11] got to reading what he called us all
[1:21:13] small great rich and poor Perce a mark
[1:21:16] in their right hand are in their
[1:21:20] foreheads not a tattoo
[1:21:24] this is Satan marking
[1:21:28] his
[1:21:30] right he marked his in their forehead
[1:21:33] their
[1:21:36] intelligence do you have a conscious of
[1:21:38] subconscious and an
[1:21:41] unconscious part of your brain that
[1:21:44] works
[1:21:46] through and their foreheads out here is
[1:21:48] where your your basic uh what do you
[1:21:52] call it contact with
[1:21:54] life your doings your your living is out
[1:21:58] in
[1:21:59] here that's why out in here you'll think
[1:22:02] wrong and do
[1:22:05] wrong and then when you drop back into
[1:22:08] more of the conscious part of your brain
[1:22:11] to the subconscious you want them say
[1:22:13] always had done
[1:22:15] that I mean that's even the
[1:22:19] centner cuz see out in the for that's
[1:22:21] why it says in the
[1:22:24] notice like I said now Ezekiel is
[1:22:25] speaking of people before the Holy Ghost
[1:22:28] come that could only seal them in their
[1:22:33] forehead you could not see them though
[1:22:35] that's only just a tight thing of the
[1:22:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost that would
[1:22:40] come all right Satan seals them in the
[1:22:49] forehead it's OD it goes on in
[1:22:52] Revelation let's see if I can find
[1:23:00] that well there's two more times in the
[1:23:04] Book of Revelation that speaks in the
[1:23:05] forehead marked in your forehead got it
[1:23:08] written down
[1:23:10] somewhere but think about it and sum up
[1:23:13] a point then we'll get on to what we're
[1:23:15] trying to cover just for a
[1:23:19] moment so you can have the baptism of
[1:23:21] the Holy Ghost in your
[1:23:23] soul you're sealed into the kingdom of
[1:23:26] God with the new
[1:23:28] birth but yet your forehead is still
[1:23:32] part of your human reasoning Factor amen
[1:23:36] your
[1:23:38] intelligence your
[1:23:40] Consciousness and in that you can still
[1:23:43] think wrong and do
[1:23:47] wrong
[1:23:50] right see God then needs to work from
[1:23:53] the inside out right
[1:23:58] right see to be able to bring our
[1:24:01] conscious
[1:24:04] part of
[1:24:06] us back into
[1:24:11] being that's where that you get a lot of
[1:24:14] head
[1:24:15] knowledge you study the
[1:24:18] message somebody comes along and
[1:24:20] preaches and all at once is it just
[1:24:22] unfolds to
[1:24:25] you right right it it's very
[1:24:30] simple that's why I've always been
[1:24:32] accused of being so deep I say I'm the
[1:24:35] most
[1:24:36] simpleminded preacher there is in the
[1:24:40] world and you say brother Dale that's
[1:24:42] just being sarcastic no that's not being
[1:24:44] sarcastic that's the way I believe it
[1:24:47] because I believe that everything I get
[1:24:50] comes from God Amen
[1:24:54] I don't believe it comes from me
[1:24:56] studying the word of God yet if I don't
[1:24:58] study the word of God he can't speak to
[1:25:00] me from the word of
[1:25:01] God that's my part of making myself
[1:25:05] available that's my part of studying the
[1:25:08] show yourself approv of workman rightly
[1:25:11] dividing the word of Truth
[1:25:15] amen I believe the language we speak in
[1:25:18] heaven is going to be Revelation on the
[1:25:24] time won't be no
[1:25:26] carnality even when we're laughing and I
[1:25:28] believe we will I believe we'll life and
[1:25:30] talk about the things that happen on
[1:25:32] Earth
[1:25:33] amen I don't believe it's all going to
[1:25:36] be removed oh wait a minute so there you
[1:25:37] computer right and
[1:25:39] see Bible says the former things are
[1:25:44] gone well if all former things are
[1:25:48] gone yep you're never going to remember
[1:25:51] you was lost
[1:25:53] so I hope that one out the
[1:25:57] door if the former things everything is
[1:26:00] gone you won't never remember you was
[1:26:03] lost and according to my understanding
[1:26:05] the prophet emphasizes even in the
[1:26:08] Millennium and going up to the on the
[1:26:11] mountain and we get down and say papa
[1:26:13] God if you had to come right you
[1:26:17] know I thought we was going to remember
[1:26:21] amen all right so what does it bring us
[1:26:26] to it brings us down to the image of the
[1:26:30] Beast being formed in
[1:26:34] America the biggest controlling factor
[1:26:38] of the world is in America by the
[1:26:41] material things that we have in the
[1:26:43] military
[1:26:45] might so we're in Revelations
[1:26:49] 13 you know all right then in doing that
[1:26:52] then we can see that the mark of the
[1:26:56] beast what about I'm onest folks and I'm
[1:27:01] sorry I see things and then I cry to say
[1:27:04] I don't want to say that
[1:27:06] Lord but then I cried I got to
[1:27:11] say what would it be to be a preacher
[1:27:15] knowing that you
[1:27:17] control MH within your
[1:27:20] hands the so soul of the individuals you
[1:27:23] speak to that's
[1:27:27] right is that
[1:27:29] true do the Bible say they give watch
[1:27:32] over your
[1:27:33] soul amen isn't that
[1:27:35] true wouldn't brother brandham so great
[1:27:38] closer with these people he said I call
[1:27:40] you bride
[1:27:43] right he said it be on my hand say say
[1:27:46] what I said right but it'll be on my
[1:27:51] hands but I think what God has entrusted
[1:27:54] me here in Lula Georgia with just a a
[1:27:57] small group of people compared to the
[1:28:01] world but yet Souls within your
[1:28:04] hands do you think that I would in any
[1:28:09] way try to deceive you what I want to
[1:28:13] deceive you
[1:28:17] for you
[1:28:19] know I'm not rich
[1:28:24] but you know it ain't even no fun go to
[1:28:26] Walmart no
[1:28:31] more we go to Walmart and used to man
[1:28:34] Manny go buy groceries and she get to
[1:28:36] buying groceries and me and the boys
[1:28:38] would still be walking around looking at
[1:28:40] stuff and lusting after all that guns
[1:28:43] and equipment
[1:28:45] and this ain't no fun no more why
[1:28:48] because if I wanted I just pick it up
[1:28:49] later in F
[1:28:54] my point is this what good is
[1:28:57] riches
[1:29:00] right right sure we'd like to have a
[1:29:02] nice little church
[1:29:04] yes and God made a way we'd have
[1:29:08] one but why us go head over heels in
[1:29:10] debt to try to get some kind of a
[1:29:12] building that would cost us $2 or $3,000
[1:29:16] a month light bill let alone anything
[1:29:19] else but bad enough like this one is
[1:29:23] yeah brother Dale wouldn't you want to
[1:29:25] be a
[1:29:28] millionaire not
[1:29:31] really I just give it all
[1:29:36] away no you
[1:29:40] wouldn't I would remind you that I've
[1:29:42] give away more than a lot of people made
[1:29:44] in their
[1:29:45] life I don't have to argue that point
[1:29:47] with
[1:29:49] nobody and not exalted about doing it
[1:29:51] it's just
[1:29:55] truthful sure I'd love to have a new
[1:29:57] home for my wife and everything but be
[1:30:00] sure of a headache for us to move into
[1:30:02] it have to pack up and
[1:30:05] move we got to have enough money to pay
[1:30:07] somebody to come and pack us up and move
[1:30:09] us we can't get out and do like we used
[1:30:11] to come on to my
[1:30:14] right some people sure but even in our
[1:30:19] deepest
[1:30:20] poverty we are the richest people in
[1:30:26] the I mean the deepest poty that's right
[1:30:30] that we could think of yep he said well
[1:30:34] brother D I sure like to have some money
[1:30:35] don't have a thing in my pocket well you
[1:30:39] know what you do with it you go out and
[1:30:41] buy something to eat or spend it on
[1:30:42] something that you don't
[1:30:47] need he said well why I don't know what
[1:30:50] I'm saying that I'm just saying the
[1:30:51] point
[1:30:52] that why do we have anything
[1:30:56] else right that's why I love that
[1:30:59] scripture and he that had
[1:31:03] wisdom Solomon wanted
[1:31:06] wisdom not knowledge right he saw his
[1:31:10] daddy and he had
[1:31:11] knowledge he wanted wisdom
[1:31:15] amen ding here is
[1:31:18] wisdom by the new birth and through my
[1:31:21] head is a great knowledge right I wish I
[1:31:24] had revealed what's in my head don't you
[1:31:31] amen all right right see then why would
[1:31:35] we wonder about it why not just take
[1:31:37] what the Bible says and why not be like
[1:31:40] what my whole point is this to hear is
[1:31:43] wisdom let him that have understanding
[1:31:44] count the number the Beast where there
[1:31:46] number of a man number one and his
[1:31:49] number is
[1:31:50] 666
[1:31:54] huh and youd rather have a million
[1:31:56] dollars or to have that
[1:32:00] understanding amen but your respond
[1:32:06] amen which would be greater a million
[1:32:08] dollars or to have the understanding of
[1:32:11] the mark of the beast amen that's right
[1:32:15] are the image to the
[1:32:18] Beast are all of these things of the
[1:32:20] great Beast with that was
[1:32:22] Rome you know the red dragon the the
[1:32:29] things see I cherish that more than all
[1:32:36] riches I cherish the revelation of God's
[1:32:38] word about one God the truth and and the
[1:32:44] Bible of
[1:32:47] Amen the truth
[1:32:49] yep but you know everybody says they
[1:32:52] have truth and they do to a
[1:32:55] degree but I want the truth don't
[1:33:00] you what good is riches when I quit my
[1:33:03] job when you become a lazy
[1:33:08] bone I think that my retirement has
[1:33:11] proved one thing that I'm not
[1:33:14] lazy but I retired when I was
[1:33:18] 51
[1:33:20] right I'm 72 will be 73 pretty
[1:33:27] quick and I do more work today than a
[1:33:29] lot of people that are
[1:33:32] 50 does in their day thank God I love
[1:33:39] to I love to work and do and just do
[1:33:43] something I can't stand it the wife will
[1:33:45] say why don't you just sit
[1:33:49] down said you done been in that that
[1:33:51] room three times and back out in the
[1:33:53] last 5 minutes y fourth time I'm going
[1:34:00] outside I yep I don't want to sit down
[1:34:04] and become
[1:34:05] lazy let the servants bring the food to
[1:34:08] me you
[1:34:14] know I rather have the understanding if
[1:34:17] you're getting at what I'm saying I
[1:34:20] think you'll follow this point
[1:34:24] Solomon knew a
[1:34:26] kingdom belonged in his hands that's
[1:34:30] right one of the greatest kingdoms that
[1:34:33] had ever existed on
[1:34:37] Earth and he had it in his
[1:34:40] hand Y and you might not agree with me
[1:34:43] on this but you know what I think he was
[1:34:47] praying he said
[1:34:50] Lord
[1:34:52] my daddy told me one
[1:34:55] time you remember David say God said to
[1:34:59] David said I took you from a sheep
[1:35:01] taking care of a few old
[1:35:04] sheep made you King over
[1:35:08] Israel that's what I thought of you
[1:35:12] David you know what Solomon I believe
[1:35:14] was willing to
[1:35:16] do go back to taking care of a handful
[1:35:19] of
[1:35:20] sheep
[1:35:25] cuz he didn't ask for riches he didn't
[1:35:27] ask for anything other than wisdom God
[1:35:30] told Solomon because you have asked for
[1:35:33] the correct
[1:35:34] thing I will give you
[1:35:37] riches and he made it the greatest
[1:35:39] Kingdom that's ever been on the earth
[1:35:41] through Solomon you know what that was
[1:35:44] that was his downfall
[1:35:48] y you think he could have been out there
[1:35:52] with all those women leading him away to
[1:35:54] in in the end time Solomon was building
[1:35:56] temples unto his wives goddess gods and
[1:36:00] you know
[1:36:02] things if he'd been back up taking care
[1:36:04] of a handful of old sheep running for
[1:36:05] his life he wouldn't had all them wise
[1:36:07] cuz they wouldn't have been out there
[1:36:08] with him for number one but number two
[1:36:10] he couldn't afford to build them nothing
[1:36:12] he said that's your rock and this is my
[1:36:16] rock right
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:23] are we willing to become
[1:36:25] poor to be
[1:36:33] rich are
[1:36:35] we are we willing to be put back to
[1:36:39] where that we were picking
[1:36:43] cotton crawling on our hands and
[1:36:46] knees reaching up in them old Cotton
[1:36:48] Birds CU we never did pull them off that
[1:36:50] was past our death
[1:36:52] we had to pick it and how can talk to
[1:36:54] you about it we had to pick it
[1:36:57] out that meant them sharp things are
[1:36:59] sticking out when you put your hand up
[1:37:01] in there it was going up under your
[1:37:03] fingernails cuz you didn't have time
[1:37:09] to no he
[1:37:12] was I do that all day to get 100
[1:37:16] plan but I still
[1:37:19] work would you be willing to go back
[1:37:22] to be able to go
[1:37:26] forward you remember the old man
[1:37:29] that wanted to know how to get the Holy
[1:37:32] Ghost and
[1:37:33] his servant black man was telling him
[1:37:36] you
[1:37:36] know he said come on boss and I'll show
[1:37:39] you take him out to Old Pig
[1:37:44] pin the servant walked right out in the
[1:37:46] mud in the pig pin you know and this is
[1:37:49] where that boss
[1:37:52] and old man stood I looked at in a while
[1:37:55] at a while he just rolled it up in
[1:37:57] Brit's leg and pulling off his
[1:38:00] shoes the servant walked over and said
[1:38:02] boss you don't have to come out
[1:38:04] here you got to be willing
[1:38:07] to we don't have to go back to poverty
[1:38:11] and
[1:38:13] right nobody's never asked
[1:38:18] that but can we go back to where we
[1:38:20] started from
[1:38:22] in the joy of our Salvation amen amen
[1:38:26] when we rejoiced over what we were
[1:38:28] seeing
[1:38:30] yes I wanted to tell everybody about it
[1:38:34] now are we trying to hold it into a
[1:38:36] little
[1:38:37] Cult of our own
[1:38:40] say what about
[1:38:45] it CU you see very easily by riches and
[1:38:48] things we could become right in the
[1:38:50] middle of this cult
[1:38:56] system remember it's his
[1:38:59] name or the number of his name
[1:39:04] right we can spend time on the
[1:39:08] 666 showing the prophet said that you
[1:39:11] know viar Phil IDE and he stood right
[1:39:13] there in Rome he said and saw the
[1:39:15] tripple Ru and Crown and saw that
[1:39:17] written over that we could count it out
[1:39:25] and do it like vicarious
[1:39:27] fad V = 5 1 I = 1 C = 100 l = 50 D =
[1:39:35] 500 see then your R A and A R and the U
[1:39:40] and the S and the F and some of those do
[1:39:45] not count in Roman numeral form of
[1:39:48] counting so you come out to be 666
[1:39:56] right but like I said your name or my
[1:39:58] name could equal to
[1:40:02] that one of the big raders if you'll run
[1:40:04] it into your computer you get home run
[1:40:07] in byar Phil ID I run it in and just
[1:40:10] look it'll tell you one head of one
[1:40:13] great organization his name was figured
[1:40:15] out to be
[1:40:18] 666 but you see he's not reallying in
[1:40:21] the world and he's not the one that's
[1:40:22] bothering
[1:40:25] us you see we're in the image to the
[1:40:27] Beast we're not we're not having to
[1:40:30] worry about the 666 cuz we don't believe
[1:40:33] there going to be no stamp but when we
[1:40:35] got his Doctrine and our
[1:40:37] forehead we're already sealed by the
[1:40:46] Antichrist you think about it
[1:40:49] Church seemingly the people of this
[1:40:53] message are the worst people to destroy
[1:40:56] the Bible and the right prophet's
[1:40:58] message that claim to believe
[1:41:05] right that true
[1:41:07] y now what's going to be
[1:41:13] next they're saying brother brand messed
[1:41:15] up this way and that way and he was
[1:41:17] wrong and you know now they're saying
[1:41:19] Jesus was wrong
[1:41:23] say Jesus done
[1:41:27] wrong people who claim this message
[1:41:30] would you mind doing me a
[1:41:32] favor Brother
[1:41:35] Gary would you do me a
[1:41:37] favor I believe if I ask him to do
[1:41:40] anything he'd try his best to do it for
[1:41:42] me if I ever twist this message up and
[1:41:44] get it off onto some idea or some
[1:41:46] thought would you please take me out of
[1:41:48] this
[1:41:49] pit
[1:41:55] why because I don't want to deceive
[1:41:57] nobody right of course there's not a
[1:42:00] preacher in the message that doesn't say
[1:42:02] that right those who believe in two
[1:42:05] Lords and all kind of things they
[1:42:08] they're so sweet and
[1:42:11] humble until you cross
[1:42:19] them CU it's
[1:42:22] church is down to wisdom versus
[1:42:28] knowledge brother Rand would even talk
[1:42:30] about wisdom versus
[1:42:32] Faith because he would talk about wisdom
[1:42:35] in that form as a knowledge or a
[1:42:37] form you'd rather have wisdom or you'd
[1:42:40] rather have some form of
[1:42:44] knowledge give me the revealed
[1:42:49] word
[1:42:51] give me the revealed word let
[1:42:54] stand let me see what the mark of the
[1:42:57] beast is in my own life get rid of
[1:43:02] it let me see my ideas and opinions go
[1:43:05] out to the
[1:43:07] door by the revealed
[1:43:11] word you don't have to worry about
[1:43:13] telling them my problems I know what a
[1:43:15] lot of those
[1:43:18] are but give me
[1:43:21] something to where I can stand on in the
[1:43:23] hour when it's all coming to a
[1:43:26] close all coming to a
[1:43:32] finish that I could be as Solomon would
[1:43:35] say put me back out in the desert taking
[1:43:39] care of a few
[1:43:41] sheep and give me
[1:43:44] wisdom let me
[1:43:46] know him in the power of his
[1:43:48] resurrection as Paul would say
[1:43:52] by being conformed to this
[1:43:56] world understanding and knowledge is a
[1:43:59] but being transformed by the renewing of
[1:44:01] his
[1:44:05] mind there's
[1:44:11] wisdom see all I've ever tried to preach
[1:44:13] is my
[1:44:15] Revelation not to show how
[1:44:19] intellect I can
[1:44:22] be but to see how much God can use me to
[1:44:26] speak to
[1:44:28] you to get you to see
[1:44:31] God get you to see the word that's all
[1:44:34] the desire I've ever had go ahead what
[1:44:36] we got appreciate these
[1:44:40] kids go
[1:44:49] ahead

[1:45:10] me anybody have a
[1:45:13] need you want wisdom you get the baptism
[1:45:17] of the Holy
[1:45:19] Ghost we get rid of the mark of the
[1:45:21] beast be sealed into the kingdom of
[1:45:25] God cuz you cannot have both
[1:45:41] of
[1:45:49] keep
[1:46:19] anding
[1:46:25] remember the other
[1:46:28] day brother boy and brother Joe came up
[1:46:31] about little baby and Amy and
[1:46:35] everything we stood here to pray and we

[1:56:16] the tumor and it disappeared right amen
[1:56:19] I believe
[1:56:20] cuz he's a
[1:56:29] he remember nanny in the morning they're
[1:56:32] going to go down her throat trying to
[1:56:33] find out what's causing that hurting in
[1:56:36] one
[1:56:37] spot so bad you know there's a lot of
[1:56:39] other parts but we just remember that to
[1:56:42] be able to do that they've been down
[1:56:44] before they couldn't find anything I'm
[1:56:47] not saying we need to go down there and
[1:56:48] find something I say go down there and
[1:56:50] find out there ain't nothing but stop
[1:56:52] the pain that's right the pain go away
[1:56:55] is what we want the healing virtues of
[1:56:59] Calvary anybody else before we go I just
[1:57:01] want to thank God that dick went to the
[1:57:04] doctor and he had had some bleeding and
[1:57:07] I was concerned about it but he wasn't
[1:57:09] concerned about it at all and so the
[1:57:11] doctor said everything was fine and we
[1:57:14] think maybe he might have passed a small
[1:57:16] kidney stone or something but we just
[1:57:18] thank God that everything all right
[1:57:20] that's just my saying I don't know what
[1:57:22] it was but I thank God that the doctor
[1:57:24] said everything's okay amen talking with
[1:57:28] Brother Richard Wilson this morning and
[1:57:29] he said that you know he's got two
[1:57:32] kidney
[1:57:32] stones you know one in each kidney I
[1:57:35] think is way it is but they're fairly
[1:57:37] small but my understanding about it the
[1:57:40] grain of sand is pretty rough when it's
[1:57:42] inside the human body you know so it's
[1:57:45] not small it's but let's just pray that
[1:57:48] God will just take them away from him
[1:57:50] they went up into his bladder the other
[1:57:52] day and everything said everything was
[1:57:53] clear no problem but the test showed
[1:57:56] that they was still two kidney stones
[1:57:59] you know that so let's just pray that
[1:58:01] God will take care of that all right
[1:58:04] let's all pray Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:58:07] for
[1:58:09] today just talking to the people about
