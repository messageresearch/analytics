[13:42] verse3 blessed be the God and father of
[13:45] our Lord Jesus
[13:46] Christ who ha blessed us with all
[13:49] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[13:52] in
[13:52] Christ according as he had chosen Us in
[13:55] him before the foundation of the world
[13:57] that we should be holy and without blame
[13:59] before him in love having predestinated
[14:02] us unto
[14:04] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[14:07] himself according to the good pleasure
[14:08] of his will to the praise of the glory
[14:11] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[14:14] accepted in the Beloved you may be
[14:17] seated Lord add his Blessing to the
[14:20] reading of the
[14:22] word now we we've been speaking about
[14:25] and talking on
[14:27] predestination and we come up to the
[14:29] adoption or point and it it will take a
[14:32] while to cover these things on adoption
[14:34] so we are just uh you know we're going
[14:37] to change the
[14:38] title and we've got up to about 27
[14:41] somewhere in there services on a
[14:44] predestination it will still be on the
[14:46] same point but we're just going to
[14:48] change the title today and and to start
[14:50] off say on adoption all right in the
[14:53] next two or three services I don't know
[14:56] really how many it will take but uh it
[14:59] will be the the point will be is uh
[15:03] adoption in three stages or three phases
[15:07] or whatever you want to make the point
[15:10] um it's hard to sometimes speak words to
[15:14] get what you want to say like the
[15:16] prophet was saying about you know uh we
[15:19] we believe in the three three stages of
[15:21] Grace he'd say it like that then he turn
[15:23] around he say well now now we don't
[15:24] believe in three stages said it's not
[15:27] three stages of Grace but said because
[15:31] you know that would kind of make it
[15:32] different he said it's three stages of
[15:35] the same Grace it just takes a while for
[15:38] it to to be able to come into
[15:40] manifestation see so then it's not not
[15:43] to say three
[15:45] steps but yet it is three steps see I
[15:48] just want to say it he would say we
[15:49] believe in that but then he'd say now uh
[15:52] it's just a
[15:53] continuation you see if you're Justified
[15:56] truly in this day then you're you're
[15:58] going to come to the place of
[16:00] sanctification and then if you're
[16:02] Sanctified you're going to come to the
[16:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost see so then
[16:06] it's it'll be bringing it to an
[16:08] understanding or Clarity to where that
[16:10] we can can uh you know follow it you
[16:13] know but we don't want to just make it
[16:15] say this set line we try to keep it to
[16:18] where we can can understand and that's
[16:20] what we're going to be covering in
[16:21] adoption uh you'll see it as we go along
[16:25] now we we covered uh the last message
[16:29] I've got this up here for some we've had
[16:31] some extra uh prayer Clause but I'm
[16:34] laying this up here where we can pray
[16:36] over it and uh you know cut up some
[16:38] extra prayer Claws and things but we
[16:40] have some more up here today if you need
[16:42] some all had a good time yesterday in
[16:45] the Bible study we all just kind of let
[16:47] our high down and and begin to just talk
[16:50] and you know and fellowshipping and it
[16:52] it was really really enjoyable uh to uh
[16:56] you know to be able to to just talk talk
[16:58] about things and and the things that God
[17:01] hates you know and all like that so it
[17:04] was we really you know the Bible says
[17:07] seven things that he hates and it was
[17:10] like a lying tongue or a proud look or
[17:12] different things you know so we just
[17:14] kind of all let our heart down and begin
[17:15] just to talk and found out we're all
[17:18] human that's right you know we're just
[17:20] all human you know we all have problems
[17:22] right and we try not to dechristianize
[17:25] anybody we try to to be what we are and
[17:29] then try to work on her doing but it's
[17:31] like the conclusion that we all reached
[17:33] of one
[17:34] thing for me to try to get you out of a
[17:38] lying tongue or a proud look or etc etc
[17:42] uh that you know that's that may be all
[17:44] right but but when I look and see myself
[17:48] right and then I work on myself right
[17:51] cuz that's the main thing is is getting
[17:53] that to to the point all right now but
[17:57] we're going to talk on a op option and
[17:58] in said we're going to cover it in in
[18:01] three stages or or whatever you want to
[18:03] call it whatever frame of words you'd
[18:05] like to use but we
[18:08] saw in our last couple of messages that
[18:12] my point was one
[18:15] thing there's never been an age that it
[18:18] was
[18:19] predestinated that's right to come forth
[18:23] right you know as it is in this age amen
[18:27] that's right and I hope you you followed
[18:28] that in the message that uh you
[18:32] know Moses he didn't build an ark right
[18:37] to try to float the children of Israel
[18:39] out of Egypt right because that had
[18:42] already been done that was for the hour
[18:46] that was there for Noah and it was a
[18:48] predestinated seed and it would have to
[18:51] come to pass and I believe God has
[18:53] things
[18:54] predestinated to where that it can't be
[18:57] changed amen now we we can pray and ask
[19:00] God to to change things and that'll work
[19:03] and he but he knows that so you're not
[19:05] going to pull anything over on him you
[19:07] know to try to to do it don't worry
[19:09] about it just just keep believing it but
[19:11] see I believe in this hour that there is
[19:14] a predestinated
[19:16] people now when it will take place that
[19:19] is up to God that's his point but why
[19:23] can't we start confessing where we're at
[19:25] and what we're believing right amen
[19:27] we're not in today of Martin Luther we
[19:29] believe that thank God for the truth we
[19:32] believe that we're not in the days of
[19:34] John Wesley we're not in the days of
[19:36] isusa Street Pentecost we're not even in
[19:39] the days of when the prophet of God
[19:41] would be going through the land you know
[19:44] uh bringing the message we're in the
[19:46] days of the
[19:48] message see and really it I like the way
[19:51] that the scripture says the voice of the
[19:54] seventh angel see all right when he
[19:57] begins to to sound all right that was
[20:00] what he brought unto us but then when
[20:03] you and I begin to sound the same
[20:05] message then you can start depending on
[20:08] something to take place all right you
[20:11] say well we've been 40 years doing it
[20:13] well all right so what if we take one
[20:15] more or two more or 10 more what does it
[20:18] matter you know see everybody's saying
[20:21] well I just don't see this and I don't
[20:23] see that well open your eyes amen amen
[20:28] I'm going to make this statement and
[20:29] then I'm not trying to justify nothing
[20:32] justification doesn't have to be
[20:34] considered in the fact when you're
[20:35] talking about
[20:37] facts we are not in the days as I said
[20:39] of those coming down we're not in the
[20:42] days of the Great Book of Acts when that
[20:44] the Holy Spirit was scattering out and
[20:46] going forth and and you know and
[20:49] bringing the people we're in the days of
[20:51] the end Gathering right when that is
[20:54] supposed to come back to that original
[20:57] word amen when now if Satan was back
[20:59] there fighting
[21:01] them real hard on the days they were
[21:04] there don't you think he's going to be
[21:06] here fighting you and I and I've always
[21:09] said it then that way then Paul you
[21:10] couldn't bring Paul down here
[21:13] today he'd be in jail before night was
[21:15] over with cuz he you know he just he
[21:18] he'd have that
[21:20] mindset to where that he would just be
[21:22] really screaming and hollering and and
[21:25] and it wouldn't work so they can't take
[21:28] our place but we can't take their place
[21:30] they've done their part now we've got
[21:31] our part all right so we went through
[21:33] the scriptures that they without us
[21:35] cannot be made perfect so they're
[21:37] waiting on you and I and I believe that
[21:40] right but I believe God has
[21:42] predestinated a seed for the age that
[21:44] we're living a word right that you and I
[21:47] are to make that manifest and it is to
[21:49] go all the way into the change of the
[21:53] body see then that's predestinated now
[21:56] it's going to take place right was there
[21:58] any way that that that Noah would not
[22:00] build an ark no because it had already
[22:03] been said all right now but Noah had to
[22:07] work and build the ark y right it wasn't
[22:10] that that God said it and know here
[22:12] appears an ark out in the middle of the
[22:14] the deserts or somewhere you know and it
[22:16] just God just speaks it no somebody's
[22:19] going to have to make this word manifest
[22:21] that's right now that's the point I'm
[22:23] trying to make to you and I we have a
[22:25] word to be made manifest let's make it
[22:27] man
[22:28] and let's start talking about it you
[22:31] know let's don't just say well well I
[22:33] don't see nothing you ain't got nothing
[22:36] I ain't got nothing
[22:38] either well I differ with you I'm
[22:41] sorry I'm sorry you know I I believe the
[22:44] word is here to be made manifest it's
[22:47] our choice of what we do with it all
[22:48] right but we were talking about it I
[22:50] said now something predestinated for the
[22:54] time meaning that that there's no way to
[22:57] change it
[22:59] there's not enough devils in hell to be
[23:01] able to stop this bride of Jesus Christ
[23:04] in the last days from coming to the
[23:06] place that God said she'd come to right
[23:09] now if he hadn't said she'd come there
[23:11] right that's a different thing but the
[23:14] prophet of God said it will be here he
[23:17] said oh yes it will be because it's done
[23:21] been said all right so then we're
[23:24] walking in what is to do all right see
[23:27] we're not back there right after the
[23:29] time of the Prophet being on the scene
[23:31] we're here now amen we're in our part of
[23:34] the doings all right so everybody's
[23:36] waiting on you and I and that's what
[23:37] we'll get to in it but just keep in mind
[23:39] now what I'm
[23:42] saying we are
[23:46] predestinated to come to the place to
[23:50] fulfill the scriptures right the in this
[23:55] day that was not fulfilled has not been
[23:59] fulfilled until this day amen all right
[24:02] so we have a wonderful thing that we're
[24:04] we're sitting here with the word of God
[24:06] realizing that God has told us what
[24:09] we're doing right through by way of the
[24:11] prophet and then all we got to do is
[24:13] just walk there in all right but here's
[24:16] what I'll say this and then this evening
[24:18] I I'll get back to it but is I told him
[24:22] last
[24:23] night you can uh holler and scream all
[24:27] you want to
[24:29] you can talk about you know and I could
[24:31] call your name I could say now brother
[24:35] collie you're doing so and so
[24:37] quit well he might quit around me
[24:41] yeah right right but he's not going to
[24:45] quit until God comes on the scene and
[24:50] delivers him from that right that's
[24:53] right it just go under cover well see
[24:55] that's what people are what and I'm
[24:57] sorry I'm just plain language I talked
[24:59] that what that's what I see most of the
[25:01] preachers has done over the 30 40 years
[25:03] that we've been around they're trying to
[25:05] make converts by
[25:08] government of rules and regulations to
[25:11] try to get people to line up and not
[25:13] that won't work right it never has and
[25:17] it won't work now brother D you don't
[25:19] believe in living right now I believe in
[25:20] being born
[25:22] again I believe in letting God
[25:25] live and then we'll come out to the
[25:27] right
[25:28] place but see in that then that's why I
[25:31] Don't Preach like all of these others
[25:33] you know but don't think I don't believe
[25:36] in living
[25:38] right I believe in it but but I believe
[25:40] in it do from an inward experience
[25:43] coming outward and then you're not
[25:45] worried then that way I drank all the
[25:47] liquor I want to I run around all I want
[25:50] to I cuss and lie and cheat and steal
[25:52] all I want
[25:55] to because that want to when way right
[25:59] I'd rather deal with it that way than
[26:01] deal with it in any other form right
[26:03] amen but don't you ever think that you
[26:05] know that that Brother D because he
[26:06] don't speak out a lot about things don't
[26:08] believe in living right right amen I do
[26:12] I believe in in doing it cuz I I believe
[26:14] that if we don't live right there's
[26:16] something wrong with us and that's
[26:18] simple that's right you know I mean if
[26:20] you live like the devil you are the
[26:22] devil that's that's simple terminologies
[26:24] that's not that doesn't take a lot of of
[26:27] great Revelation you know that's we was
[26:32] last night talking about a lion tongues
[26:34] and things you know we went up to the to
[26:36] a fishing tournament there and the guy
[26:38] was telling us that all all fishermen
[26:40] are liars you know well I don't agree
[26:42] with that I'm like the old guy that said
[26:45] you know I killed 99 rabbits and the guy
[26:47] said well why my Lord I just told
[26:49] everybody I killed 100 he said why lie
[26:51] about one
[26:53] rabbit I
[26:56] mean we're not supposed to be
[26:59] Liars we're supposed to be Christians
[27:01] all right but now let's get on to it but
[27:04] see in this day
[27:06] now what I'm trying to say I got it
[27:08] wrote down here and underlined and
[27:10] everything else to try to make a point
[27:12] then we'll go in to doing
[27:17] it in this age we are
[27:21] predestinated unto the completion right
[27:24] now are you listening to the word I'm
[27:26] using the word completion which means
[27:28] bringing something to a finish all right
[27:31] we are to bring to a finish the stages
[27:35] of adoption
[27:37] right and if we don't believe it's in
[27:39] this hour surely we got to believe it's
[27:40] close right you know right and all the
[27:44] way to what to
[27:48] understand the Redemption of the body
[27:51] right just because you're adopted I'll
[27:53] make this point blunt it's because we're
[27:56] even adopted and understand the
[27:58] Redemption of the body that doesn't mean
[28:01] the body is redeemed right there no
[28:04] that's right that's why I'm calling it
[28:07] stages see growth development uh
[28:11] whatever you want to use to to to be
[28:13] able to understand cuz see I believe
[28:16] every age was
[28:18] predestinated now all the way through
[28:20] whether it would be Luther Wesley
[28:22] whatever it would be every age was
[28:25] predestinated to have and receive the
[28:28] new birth right amen because that would
[28:31] be the qualifications to get into the
[28:33] body of Christ amen you can't get into
[28:36] the body of Christ without being born
[28:39] again all right so then in that then
[28:42] every age would be predestinated to the
[28:45] New Birth amen but you and I are
[28:48] predestinated to bring forth the
[28:51] finality or
[28:53] completion of you know the the the
[28:56] stages and and the the things of
[28:59] adoption to to where that we can bring
[29:01] it into that point and if if I use the
[29:03] wrong word you make it right I'm you you
[29:06] understand what I'm saying right the
[29:08] said the prophet would say we believe in
[29:10] three steps of Grace and he said no it's
[29:11] not three steps of
[29:14] Grace he's he's he's a human being like
[29:17] me that's stumbling for words and things
[29:19] to try to say to get you to see because
[29:22] one person is saying steps another
[29:24] person stages another person this
[29:26] another person is that and that way your
[29:28] mind is being Twisted backwards and
[29:30] forth and and all like that but what I
[29:33] want to do now is just to start
[29:35] off so we we're just going to title this
[29:38] adoption for a while and it'll be
[29:40] basically adoption in three stages
[29:43] but I want us to just start off in the
[29:47] Simplicity of understanding and then
[29:50] that way we'll grow into the things and
[29:53] and you that you know uh have been
[29:56] around a long time by with us because
[29:58] remember other people are listening out
[30:00] there and I'm trying to make it as plain
[30:02] as I can but I believe too that we need
[30:05] to understand who we
[30:07] are that's my point is understanding who
[30:10] we are and what we're
[30:12] doing see we the the adoptions and the
[30:16] things to me has been made so big until
[30:19] it's made out there somewhere you know
[30:22] beyond what we can attain un to and I
[30:26] don't agree with that right
[30:28] I never have agreed with it I believe
[30:30] that if God says it we can attain unto
[30:33] it all right but see you you you'll turn
[30:37] around people will and they'll take the
[30:38] great things of the Bible and as I said
[30:41] a moment ago and they'll bring up Paul
[30:43] and Peter and and look what took place
[30:46] in the book of Acts yeah you know and
[30:49] wonderful it did we believe that right
[30:52] but the problem is they turn around and
[30:54] said I don't see it
[30:56] today
[31:00] see now what have you done right you
[31:03] planted a seed of ruination into the
[31:05] minds of people and you've made it to
[31:08] where that they can't accept what's
[31:10] going
[31:11] on that's right I'm as honest as I can
[31:13] believe you bring the book of Acts up
[31:15] here today and they would
[31:20] be they go
[31:23] Haywire CU brother brand said it I
[31:26] didn't he said the
[31:28] spirit that was back
[31:31] there to do those things is the same
[31:36] Holy Spirit living in
[31:40] you to manifest the hour that you're
[31:47] living did you hear me yeah the same
[31:51] holy spirit that justified the Lutheran
[31:53] Sanctified the Methodist baptized the
[31:56] Pentecostals is is Now setting an order
[31:58] the coming of the Lord he said it was
[32:00] the same Holy
[32:02] Spirit but yet we've lost the the point
[32:06] of of seeing something like it is and
[32:10] then when you try to express it oh you
[32:13] just you you're just trying to prop up
[32:18] something
[32:21] no no I don't believe it I'm just not
[32:24] telling you like I believe it you bring
[32:26] the book of ACT people right up here
[32:28] right now and let them live in this
[32:29] environment that you and I are living in
[32:31] and they'd say send me back to the book
[32:33] of
[32:35] Acts why because they fought two
[32:38] organizations we fight 969 that was a
[32:41] long time ago and about 10,000 in this
[32:44] message right I'm talking about in the
[32:46] message people
[32:50] right you don't have all they didn't
[32:53] have the doctrines the the existence and
[32:56] things that we have to fight daily
[32:58] through our
[33:00] mind as Satan coming in and and bringing
[33:03] up those things and and trying to
[33:06] dechristianize us in every
[33:09] form Paul would probably pull his hir
[33:11] out if he come up here and live for
[33:13] about a
[33:13] week and seen all the things if he was
[33:16] holling like he was back there even to
[33:19] turning over who philus hus even so
[33:22] strong he said I just turn you guys over
[33:24] to the
[33:25] devil you know what would he do today
[33:29] with all the doctrinal issues and the
[33:31] the situations of life that we're living
[33:34] in
[33:35] here and see people say oh you're just
[33:38] trying to make an excuse well what's
[33:39] your
[33:42] excuse come on you you people are glad
[33:45] to throw it my way but what's your
[33:48] excuse where are you at where's your
[33:52] manifestations I'll stand here all
[33:54] afternoon and not brag just tell the
[33:56] God's on truth that I can get amen out
[33:58] of the congregation of how that God has
[34:01] been been here with us and great things
[34:03] have taken place from the dead raised
[34:06] the sick healed all
[34:08] things we had people
[34:12] well I don't see nothing going
[34:15] on wake up what are you looking for it
[34:19] will never take place under that kind of
[34:22] a situation right see cuz you're looking
[34:26] for something that will not take
[34:29] place Jesus Christ could not heal in one
[34:33] city there he had to leave the city to
[34:35] heal somebody
[34:37] amen right and he was almighty God right
[34:41] amen you see we want to look for some
[34:45] kind of great manifestation the greatest
[34:47] manifestation that I can see anywhere is
[34:50] a group of people that are gradually
[34:52] slowly holding on and just staying with
[34:55] the word and and and battling out Satan
[34:58] over the word of the hour
[35:01] right sure we want to see the sick
[35:03] healed and the dead raised right we want
[35:05] to see those things
[35:07] right but if it's true that Jesus
[35:10] couldn't do a miracle because of their
[35:12] unbelief bring it down here today what
[35:14] would he be doing
[35:17] right that's right I S to see when I
[35:20] start talking like everybody thinks that
[35:21] I'm I'm trying to prop up I'm not trying
[35:24] to prop up nothing I'm telling it like
[35:26] it is
[35:27] where's your signs and
[35:29] wonders
[35:32] right I can stand here and talk about
[35:34] what God has done Among Us right amen
[35:37] but how many of you even think about
[35:38] those
[35:40] things well we just not seeing nothing
[35:43] bu sh people among us many are the
[35:46] afflictions of the righteous the Bible
[35:48] says that's
[35:50] right we're
[35:55] deteriorating
[35:58] but see I'm just trying to get a
[36:01] point we belittle our own selves and we
[36:03] let Satan get in their minds and and and
[36:06] torment us that's it amen
[36:10] right and tell us say well if if you got
[36:12] what you thought you had let's let's see
[36:14] this that the other
[36:18] right somebody's going to do that one
[36:20] these days you're going to get called
[36:21] down and I'm sorry and it won't be
[36:24] somebody with a sarcastic hateful
[36:26] attitude call you down it'll be somebody
[36:29] just standing there knowing the truth is
[36:30] the truth that's right brother R said
[36:33] there be Anan Safar laying all over the
[36:36] place now Peter and them wasn't
[36:38] sarcastic that caused ananas and shf
[36:40] fire but there was truth amen but they
[36:44] were standing on the word of the hour
[36:47] right all
[36:50] right but listen why can't we believe
[36:53] what God has said about us amen he's
[36:56] called us bright that's right he's
[36:59] called us wonderful marvelous he's
[37:01] called us beautiful am why can't we
[37:04] believe
[37:05] that right well if I just see something
[37:08] well you'll never see it t because
[37:10] that's your that's your
[37:12] way because God doesn't do it that
[37:15] way he's wanting to see who will stand
[37:18] with the word
[37:23] amen but see I believe
[37:25] everybody is
[37:29] predestinated according to for knowledge
[37:31] amen right right
[37:33] y but then when you go into for
[37:37] knowledge you must take another step
[37:40] from forn knowledge to come to the
[37:43] predetermining of the word or
[37:46] seed all
[37:48] right see he knows where to
[37:51] fall that's for knowledge but
[37:54] predetermining is the fact that he
[37:56] himself said it will take place
[38:01] right right right and there's the word
[38:04] of seed all right so this is the age
[38:07] amen this is the time to talk about
[38:10] adoption right because that's what the
[38:12] whole world's waiting
[38:15] on all right now you I know you don't
[38:19] like me and everything people don't but
[38:21] but I'm telling the truth it said the
[38:24] Lord Jesus went into a city couldn't
[38:25] even heal a
[38:27] person because of their
[38:30] unbelief bless God I go in and heal them
[38:32] all no no we don't go that
[38:36] way right I've been around long enough
[38:39] and people say I take every spirit in
[38:41] here under my control be careful
[38:46] y be careful
[38:49] right because Satan is not a bully
[38:52] that's right sure he's a
[38:54] bluff but it's kind of like old
[38:57] boy that we all know Billy free you know
[38:58] he'd run his mouth he'd run his mouth he
[39:01] always was lying like crazy and running
[39:03] his mouth and everything else but old
[39:05] boy done at work one day challenged him
[39:07] on something Little Billy just beat
[39:08] daylight side of him so he back up what
[39:10] he's talking
[39:12] about don't try you you better have the
[39:16] goods remember my
[39:17] point no person is a match for the devil
[39:21] right but the holy spirit in the least
[39:25] member right of the body of Christ is
[39:29] not just a match for the Devil he's the
[39:32] devil's
[39:34] master all right amen see then don't
[39:37] back down let's go on with it all right
[39:40] but we want to cover it see all right
[39:44] adoption they said we're going to talk
[39:46] about it in three
[39:48] stages and using it we're going to use
[39:51] the Lord Jesus as a background because
[39:53] that was the way that it was done by the
[39:55] prophet I wish that you would go there's
[39:58] probably at least 30 or 40 hear you
[40:02] hymns there's a lot of tapes called
[40:04] position in Christ there's messages
[40:07] called adoption there's all kind of
[40:09] things I wish you would go there we have
[40:11] books on it on adoption and everything I
[40:14] wish you would study
[40:16] that and listen to the prophet as he
[40:19] explains the things about adoption you
[40:22] know and to where that we can can get on
[40:25] with it all right
[40:26] now in doing
[40:28] that let's take as I said let's take it
[40:31] in three stages and we'll take it like
[40:33] the Lord Jesus all right
[40:36] now the Lord Jesus on the River
[40:40] Jordan was identified
[40:44] right that's where it said this is my
[40:46] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[40:49] now don't go to the he ye him wait until
[40:51] a amount of transfiguration on that
[40:53] point but remember that he was
[40:58] recognized right there on the River
[41:01] Jordan we could read those scriptures
[41:02] but you can read them yourself as
[41:04] Matthew
[41:05] 3 all right he was recognized before the
[41:08] world as to be almighty God Amen this is
[41:11] my part of the earth the prophet said
[41:14] future home that I have redeemed and
[41:16] from this part of the earth I'll redeem
[41:18] the rest right there was all that we
[41:21] have need of right in Jesus Christ amen
[41:26] it was all that we have need of he was
[41:30] identified as
[41:33] what the Son of God Amen all right he
[41:37] was
[41:38] identified
[41:40] okay the world saw you know whatever was
[41:44] there and then it's recorded and put
[41:46] around the world and bibles have been
[41:47] written so the world has to witness that
[41:50] almighty God came down Y and verified
[41:55] that this was his son right not
[41:58] trinitarianism or nothing like that see
[42:01] it was God coming down himself but he
[42:03] identified him there and said this is my
[42:07] son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all
[42:11] right then the second stage would go
[42:14] over which would be manifestation or
[42:17] authority and that would carry you over
[42:19] to mount of
[42:20] transfiguration which would be Matthew
[42:23] 17 and then in that situ ation it shows
[42:27] him glorified now B to River Jordan he
[42:30] wasn't showed his glorified right
[42:32] man it's just identified right all right
[42:37] now are you listening right write it
[42:39] down see J down the little point so of
[42:42] what we're thinking on see first he was
[42:47] identified there was no uh great
[42:51] manifestations
[42:53] right he was just identified on the
[42:55] River Jordan
[42:56] a voice from Heaven see this is my
[42:59] beloved Son all but then when you come
[43:02] over to mount of transfiguration Matthew
[43:06] 17 then Jesus was glorified before him
[43:10] right the prophet of God said adoption
[43:13] glorifies Jesus Christ all right now and
[43:17] being glorified see then he comes out
[43:20] with full Authority
[43:23] right
[43:25] okay this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[43:27] pleased to dwell hear ye him all right
[43:32] now I was just looking at it back there
[43:34] holyo it's reading I invite you to to go
[43:37] and read them and pay close attention to
[43:40] the things brother brandham says on it
[43:43] he said that when Jesus was on the River
[43:45] Jordan said he said what he says is what
[43:48] is
[43:49] said he said River
[43:53] Jordan see we won all of it flops over
[43:56] to Transfiguration no because he was a
[44:00] child of God right he was God made
[44:02] manifest in human
[44:05] flesh all right he had Authority he had
[44:10] uh you know
[44:11] manifestations before it come to amount
[44:13] of
[44:14] transfiguration right right matter of
[44:16] fact there's a whole lot more there
[44:18] before than there was cuz it only like
[44:20] three you know mostly 6 months or
[44:23] something or less from the time that he
[44:25] goes to Transfiguration he go straight
[44:26] to Calvary the biggest portion of the
[44:29] healings the signs and the Wonders was
[44:31] back in his early
[44:32] ministry right right in other words it
[44:35] even got to the basis and it looked like
[44:37] he was losing
[44:39] everything go back in his early Ministry
[44:42] where he could just speak it and this
[44:44] would happen or that would happen
[44:45] seemingly when it gets down to the later
[44:47] parts of of going towards Calvary that
[44:50] he look like he was losing
[44:54] things but yet that pointed I tried to
[44:58] make See You Don't See Jesus glorified
[45:01] on the on River Jordan
[45:04] right you see him identified amen right
[45:09] but when he come to the amount of
[45:11] transfiguration it showed him in his
[45:13] glorified
[45:14] State completion
[45:18] finished right there in him was
[45:20] everything right then he goes
[45:24] on
[45:26] and he's
[45:27] crucified right all right and then when
[45:32] he comes up the body
[45:34] raises so we'll get back to Romans and
[45:37] when we get to it you know about two we
[45:38] to understand the Redemption of the body
[45:41] right there his body was
[45:43] redeemed right not that it was sinful
[45:46] but because it had a beginning right and
[45:49] anything has a beginning has to have an
[45:50] ending to it see his body was not
[45:53] Eternal as he was dwelling on Earth all
[45:56] right now I know these are simple things
[45:58] but I'm just that's what I'm trying to
[46:00] do drop down now and then we'll go up
[46:03] gradually so be with us you know but you
[46:07] know I've always been one thing that I
[46:10] love to hear people talk about their
[46:12] experiences you know I sure do love to
[46:14] do water baptisms and things I love to
[46:16] do that and I love to to view things of
[46:19] where people are baptized and see things
[46:21] like that cuz I I can talk about your
[46:23] experience there cuz I had one of them
[46:26] you know that's where I can enjoy it so
[46:28] I don't I'm not so great revelated until
[46:31] I just go to sleep and I'll wake back up
[46:34] when brother Dale gets on up a few more
[46:35] stages you know and all CU I'm I'm so
[46:38] much far above that well I'm telling you
[46:40] right now then you're the one I'm
[46:41] talking about you're not above that if
[46:44] that's what you think that's right sorry
[46:47] that's
[46:48] right that's just the way it is we
[46:51] should be able to Rejoice with everybody
[46:53] all right but after the resurrection of
[46:55] the Lord Jesus you'll find him
[46:59] then in Matthew
[47:02] 28 right now after his resurrection you
[47:06] don't find a scripture that we quote a
[47:09] lot of times but you'll find it after
[47:11] the resurrection when Jesus said all
[47:13] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[47:16] me right amen that's after the
[47:19] resurrection
[47:21] right but we quoted as he had all power
[47:24] and authority
[47:26] right the city couldn't heal because of
[47:28] this the unbelief he had to put people
[47:31] out that's right because of the unbelief
[47:34] right but you don't hear him after the
[47:36] resurrection having to put nobody out
[47:38] right amen then so then in the minute
[47:41] the life the ministry and the things of
[47:43] the Lord
[47:45] Jesus then we see the three stages that
[47:48] we talk about in adoption
[47:52] identification he was identified as a
[47:54] child of God all right then coming to
[47:58] full Authority or manifestation of hear
[48:01] ye him on the Mount of
[48:03] transfiguration and then coming up to a
[48:05] change of the
[48:08] body bringing it to a position to where
[48:12] that then he would say all power in
[48:14] Heaven and Earth is now given unto me
[48:17] amen after his resurrection all right
[48:21] now see then doing it
[48:27] like this now let's take
[48:31] ourselves let's take
[48:33] ourselves all right through these things
[48:37] that we talk
[48:39] about you know and see if we can see in
[48:42] ourselves the
[48:44] things
[48:46] that took place in the ministry of the
[48:49] Lord
[48:51] Jesus and remember see here's where
[48:54] everybody's at this this is what and I'm
[48:56] sorry I just I'm blunt and I'm I'm I
[48:59] know it but see that's where people say
[49:02] well I like to see you do what brother
[49:04] random done I can't do it and you can't
[49:08] either right amen so don't toach your
[49:13] horn see you run around oh brother Dale
[49:15] think he's something let's see him do
[49:18] what the prophet done well let's see you
[49:20] do what the prophet
[49:21] done of course nobody ain't going to
[49:24] listen that way they're going to get
[49:26] yeah that's right that's right y y yep
[49:28] that's no garbage can that's that
[49:30] running mouth we talking last night the
[49:31] lying tongu and the things we're talking
[49:34] about
[49:36] right it's really easy to
[49:39] brag right until you stand in front of
[49:43] somebody that's got the goods right
[49:48] right you know you you really brag what
[49:52] standing for somebody's got the goods
[49:54] you see them shut up
[49:57] up I'm just I know it I know I shouldn't
[50:00] be that point but my point
[50:03] is we're down here a long way it's 40
[50:06] years after the the going away of the
[50:09] Prophet what are you looking
[50:13] for what are you looking for to take
[50:16] place to bring about a resurrection and
[50:18] a
[50:20] Rapture and how many definitions would
[50:22] we
[50:24] get
[50:27] I love what brother R said he said God
[50:30] is not going to send the
[50:33] headstone because of your merits he said
[50:37] he will send it because he promised
[50:41] it because there's no merits in any of
[50:45] us for anything that's right why are we
[50:48] think we're so much greater than any of
[50:51] the other churches around there's only
[50:53] one difference and that's the holy Holy
[50:56] Spirit and they have the anointing that
[50:58] a lot of times makes us ashamed of
[51:00] ourselves right but then they turn down
[51:03] the word so you know there's something
[51:04] wrong right all right so give me the
[51:07] word Oh Brother D you're just word word
[51:09] word will you tell me what it's supposed
[51:10] to
[51:13] be there one thing about it you can't
[51:15] say about this old boy you're looking at
[51:17] those on the internet don't know it but
[51:19] the people around here had one been
[51:21] around you know this old boy's never
[51:22] been down about what God has done right
[51:28] most people are looking for what God
[51:30] will do
[51:33] right I look back and see what God has
[51:37] done and I stand on what God has done
[51:40] the things that we've seen him
[51:43] do right and in that way see now I'm not
[51:46] trying to be rid of
[51:49] ROM but who are
[51:52] you you know I got in trouble about that
[51:54] being say uh you're not Jr and I'm not
[51:58] Sue Ellen I got in trouble that years
[51:59] ago trying to explain something about it
[52:01] but it's a plain honest
[52:03] truth people want to run their mouth
[52:05] would you let them get in front of
[52:06] somebody that really knows what you're
[52:07] talking about amen that's
[52:11] right oh yeah they'll shut up then see
[52:14] cuz they know right but now my point of
[52:16] what Jesus went through three
[52:21] stages
[52:24] identification Authority or
[52:28] manifestation when he come to man of
[52:30] transfiguration brother Brandon said
[52:32] simply in plain
[52:33] language he said God said I'm backing
[52:36] off if you hear anything you'll get it
[52:38] from him that's why there was a not a
[52:41] lot said between Mount of
[52:43] transfiguration and Calvary there was
[52:46] not a lot said right read your Bible
[52:50] right it covers it real
[52:53] quick why because was God stepped back
[52:57] and said if you hear anything you'll get
[52:59] it
[52:59] there that's to me when brother randam
[53:02] come to his
[53:03] ministry there in 63 in the opening of
[53:06] the seals that was to me was the
[53:07] ministry of the
[53:08] Prophet
[53:11] right everything got real quiet except
[53:14] what he was saying right amen that's
[53:17] right and the only way we can hear from
[53:20] God is to hear it through that man
[53:22] amen I've said that and I don't back up
[53:26] right you said well so and so I don't
[53:29] care about so and so tell me what the
[53:31] word says right the man brought us the
[53:35] message that's right but it's up to us
[53:37] to get into the message and live the
[53:39] message not just talk about a message
[53:42] but become the alive word upon Earth
[53:46] that's all I've ever said it we're
[53:47] supposed to do but in point in doing
[53:49] that what are we looking for to take
[53:51] place that's on me so forgive me I mean
[53:55] what are we looking to take
[53:59] place why can't we talk about what God
[54:01] has done
[54:06] amen why can't we talk about what God
[54:09] has done Among Us
[54:11] amen is it exalted to tell the
[54:17] truth what you see no no people don't
[54:19] want to hear it like that right why
[54:22] because their preachers in their pull
[54:24] pits is blinded them to the point of
[54:26] what the truth really is Right
[54:30] amen and and see it's not that way but
[54:33] see Jesus was
[54:36] identified and to do that you know what
[54:38] he had to
[54:40] have now let's see if we can say we've
[54:42] been through these stages all right but
[54:45] I'll just take a little bit at your time
[54:47] and we'll go along and then just the
[54:48] next message will be a
[54:50] continuation but see Jesus went to River
[54:55] Jordan right now where was there any
[54:58] sick healed and dead raised and
[55:01] manifestation
[55:05] right right you got one man standing
[55:07] there which was John the Baptist that
[55:09] said he saw
[55:10] it and it was not necessary did anybody
[55:14] else see it right
[55:17] right it's not recorded that Millions
[55:20] stood by and saw all these things that's
[55:23] right it's only recorded that
[55:25] John saw the Spirit descending that's
[55:29] right so we got John's
[55:32] word that's
[55:34] right and we got the word of God that
[55:37] would speak from you know God's word
[55:39] speaking from Heaven that this is my
[55:41] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[55:45] amen no sick heel no dead
[55:48] rais I hope you're listening right but
[55:53] he had to be baptized
[55:57] right why did Jesus have to be
[56:00] baptized we've been through that right
[56:03] the prophet's been true that he
[56:04] explained it right the sacrifice had to
[56:06] be
[56:10] washed all
[56:12] right so having to be washed he had to
[56:15] be baptized he said it's natural that I
[56:17] be baptized with the you know why comest
[56:20] down to me he said let's just fulfill
[56:22] all righteousness let's do what the
[56:24] Bible said
[56:25] amen right
[56:28] right and we know that he did not have
[56:31] to receive the new
[56:33] birth right he was the new birth that's
[56:36] right amen but he went through as an
[56:39] example for you and I that's right amen
[56:43] and see publicly he was
[56:46] baptized by the only man that was
[56:49] capable of doing it amen that's right
[56:53] right right a fuzzy bearded old man
[56:56] standing out in the water with long
[56:57] hiring and old sheep skin wrapped around
[56:59] him why wasn't Kus brought out to
[57:01] baptize Jesus right
[57:05] amen why wouldn't all them great leaders
[57:07] you know let me I want supposed to do
[57:10] let me go
[57:11] bti no
[57:15] no the only man that could have baptized
[57:17] the only man that could
[57:19] identify
[57:21] right was John the
[57:23] Baptist you age y
[57:27] right all now what about our water
[57:34] baptism
[57:35] right I remember brother dick years ago
[57:38] has asked me a question that's when we
[57:39] first started talking he said is is is
[57:42] water a baptism
[57:45] essential I thought for a minute and I
[57:47] thought well I've got to have an answer
[57:49] this is what I said I said the truth
[57:53] is
[57:55] you can say well can you get in the
[57:56] Kingdom well this man on the cross got
[57:58] in the kingdom and this one see you just
[58:00] argue all about it that don't influence
[58:03] me at
[58:07] all do you think you can get into the
[58:09] kingdom of God without being
[58:14] baptized now we're not talking about the
[58:16] thief on the cross right okay right
[58:19] we're not talking about that the Holy
[58:20] Ghost and it can fall on people before
[58:23] they're baptized right right but you
[58:25] tell me it fell on somebody and then
[58:27] they refused to go get baptized in the
[58:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll tell
[58:30] you you're a liar and that other
[58:31] person's a
[58:33] liar right CU I don't agree with it
[58:37] right see the Bible tells you how to get
[58:40] into the Kingdom right repent every one
[58:43] of you and be baptized in the name of
[58:45] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[58:47] see because that's your identification
[58:49] right
[58:51] amen you said but now no now he was a
[58:53] son all right we good going get to that
[58:55] okay don't worry about it don't get
[58:57] ahead of me just follow
[58:59] me see he had to be baptized to prove
[59:04] that he was the
[59:07] sacrifice that's right are you listening
[59:10] yes your baptism don't save
[59:13] you right but without it you can't have
[59:19] salvation
[59:22] right right no problem is it right
[59:25] now get what I'm talking
[59:27] about it was part of Jesus's
[59:31] identification that he be washed right
[59:34] in a baptism
[59:36] y it's part of our identification for us
[59:39] to be washed in water in a baptism
[59:44] amen it don't make us no the children of
[59:49] God right no it's an answer of a good
[59:53] conscience all right see now you got the
[59:57] people you know that believe this water
[59:58] baptism under regeneration Stu we don't
[1:00:00] believe
[1:00:01] that but we believe that water baptism
[1:00:04] is
[1:00:05] essential right to those that know the
[1:00:08] truth Amen to be able to receive
[1:00:11] salvation
[1:00:12] right so now his water baptism didn't
[1:00:16] make him a child no right you follow
[1:00:22] me it was part of his identification as
[1:00:25] a
[1:00:27] child the holy spirit that came down
[1:00:30] upon Jesus on the River Jordan never
[1:00:32] made him a child of God that's where
[1:00:35] your River Jordan people where they're
[1:00:37] going that's their
[1:00:41] business it never made him a child of
[1:00:43] God right
[1:00:45] amen he was born a child of
[1:00:48] God Amen this day in the city of David
[1:00:52] is born a savior which is Christ the
[1:00:54] lord
[1:00:55] it didn't make him a savior it didn't
[1:00:57] make him a a child of God it just
[1:01:01] identified him before the world
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:06] see other words here he
[1:01:09] is all right now your baptism doesn't
[1:01:13] save
[1:01:16] you and it does not make you a child of
[1:01:20] God
[1:01:22] right it only identifies you right why
[1:01:26] wouldn't you want to be identified
[1:01:28] that's
[1:01:29] right to me it's like a woman going down
[1:01:31] and want to get married to a man and
[1:01:33] then she wants to keep her m and d
[1:01:34] That's garbage can to me that's right I
[1:01:37] ain't going to do
[1:01:41] it I'm not going to marry somebody like
[1:01:43] that I just want to do it you can do
[1:01:45] what you want to that's your business
[1:01:46] you you're you're you're left in your
[1:01:48] world I'm in
[1:01:50] mine but I'm not going to do it cuz
[1:01:53] you're not identified
[1:01:56] right marriage identifies you
[1:02:01] y you ever look up you ever looked up
[1:02:04] the definition of
[1:02:06] adoption or
[1:02:13] adopt then you wonder why I'm talking
[1:02:16] about marriages or something like
[1:02:20] that see when you're baptized in water
[1:02:24] you're taking on his name amen right
[1:02:27] amen you're testifying to the
[1:02:30] world Amen that you you've left your old
[1:02:34] husband he's dead amen that's right and
[1:02:37] you're going to be married to Jesus
[1:02:40] Christ right right and you come out to
[1:02:43] be a spouse right have you ever looked
[1:02:46] up
[1:02:52] adopt adopt is is to take a take by
[1:02:57] choice into a
[1:03:02] relationship to take my choice into a
[1:03:06] relationship to take voluntarily a child
[1:03:10] of other
[1:03:12] parents as one's own child
[1:03:17] right the word adopt means to
[1:03:23] choose
[1:03:25] sure choose you this day who you that's
[1:03:28] right it means to
[1:03:32] embrace now think about you word a
[1:03:34] baptism come on
[1:03:36] right you know that the word adopt means
[1:03:39] to a
[1:03:41] spouse I just wrote this out of Webster
[1:03:44] so if you argue with him you
[1:03:46] know
[1:03:50] amen let's read what it says on strong
[1:03:54] strong
[1:03:55] concordance about
[1:03:58] adoption to adopt adoption of children
[1:04:00] adoption of sons adoption of Dos of his
[1:04:03] sons that relationship you don't have it
[1:04:06] in your notes at all right that
[1:04:08] relationship which God has was pleased
[1:04:11] to establish between himself and the
[1:04:16] Israelites in preference to all other
[1:04:22] nations right now he adopted them
[1:04:28] right right they become a
[1:04:32] spous the nature and condition of the
[1:04:35] true disciples in Christ who by
[1:04:39] receiving the spirit of God into their
[1:04:41] souls become sons of God it's also in it
[1:04:46] also includes the Blessed State look for
[1:04:49] for in the future life after the visible
[1:04:53] return of Christ from
[1:04:57] Heaven A
[1:05:02] spous engaged
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:06] right see when you went down in the
[1:05:09] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:11] Christ you were supposed to die thank
[1:05:14] the Lord that's right right amen amen
[1:05:18] right and I like what that that brother
[1:05:21] in Germany said that time he said
[1:05:24] he said when we baptize them said we
[1:05:26] want them to have their mouth wide
[1:05:28] open he said cuz that's the first thing
[1:05:31] it needs to be clean and I hollered amen
[1:05:35] when he said of course he was talking
[1:05:37] about it like 15° you know and you know
[1:05:43] you know see your water baptism has a
[1:05:46] lot more to do with it than just your
[1:05:48] thinking about it well just way we we
[1:05:51] sure we going down today and get dumped
[1:05:53] but R sit turn and go back you're not
[1:05:55] worthy that's
[1:05:59] right Jesus was
[1:06:03] identified by his
[1:06:06] baptism y then a voice from heaven
[1:06:11] right identified him before the world as
[1:06:15] his
[1:06:17] child right but you know he's always a
[1:06:20] child right
[1:06:23] man why because he was God right now if
[1:06:26] you were listening to what the
[1:06:28] definition of adoption gave to whereby
[1:06:30] that God adopted
[1:06:32] Israel out of all the nations of the
[1:06:36] world he
[1:06:39] chosen he adopted him he espoused
[1:06:44] him to
[1:06:47] himself did you're peculiar
[1:06:53] people see your water
[1:06:55] baptism shows to the world that you've
[1:06:58] taken on the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ amen right and see you you want
[1:07:03] to do it secretly because you don't want
[1:07:05] nobody to be around then don't ask me to
[1:07:07] do it CU that's you know I'm sorry
[1:07:10] because I don't like it that way I like
[1:07:14] for you to just be straight and
[1:07:15] honest and when brother dick and them
[1:07:19] came up years ago to be baptized and
[1:07:21] sister Gail she said well well brother
[1:07:24] they said uh I'm going to be baptized
[1:07:25] too I said well great cuz I was only
[1:07:28] dependent on baptizing brother dick and
[1:07:29] brother Al and you know I said well
[1:07:32] that's great that's great she said yeah
[1:07:35] I'm going to get baptized cuz my husband
[1:07:37] wants me too I said I won't baptize
[1:07:41] you that's what I
[1:07:44] say but we talked on for a little while
[1:07:46] and I looked at her and grinned and I
[1:07:48] said sister you're not pulling nothing
[1:07:49] over on me I said you really see it she
[1:07:52] said yes I said okay I'll baptize
[1:07:56] you she might have been in honor of
[1:07:59] husband and all that sure that's
[1:08:00] wonderful that's
[1:08:02] great but I want you know that's right
[1:08:06] you to understand that your baptism was
[1:08:08] a day that men not more to you than you
[1:08:10] ever thought
[1:08:15] about it meant a day that you was
[1:08:21] identified right and you took on his
[1:08:25] name
[1:08:27] right amen and you know what that is
[1:08:29] that's
[1:08:33] adoption but see we think oh it's got to
[1:08:35] be this it's got to be that
[1:08:40] no it's simply something you're going
[1:08:42] through amen right right and we've been
[1:08:47] going through it a long time
[1:08:49] amen that's right but you see everybody
[1:08:51] wants to look at something out there
[1:08:54] we're no more than what it used to be
[1:08:55] and I'm not throwing off on nobody but
[1:08:57] the old good old Baptist Doctrine one of
[1:08:59] these days we're going to get up to
[1:09:00] heaven I don't know whether I'm saved or
[1:09:03] not but one of these days I'll know I'm
[1:09:05] saved well they were just speaking what
[1:09:08] they believed in their
[1:09:11] mind but I thought we were supposed to
[1:09:13] know we're saved
[1:09:16] right I thought we're supposed to know
[1:09:18] something about it all right but now
[1:09:22] listen so then you water a baptism is
[1:09:24] when you were identified
[1:09:27] right so you started your
[1:09:30] adoption
[1:09:31] Y no now brother Dale I got the quotes
[1:09:34] where the okay I gave you the quotes and
[1:09:37] I got plenty
[1:09:38] more we know the whole story and we know
[1:09:42] that your new birth is not your adoption
[1:09:44] I'd be glad to give you those quotes
[1:09:46] that's right because it's not the
[1:09:48] adoption for this age this age is the
[1:09:51] change of the body amen right the finish
[1:09:54] the authorities Etc we'll get through
[1:09:56] those things just don't run
[1:09:58] ahead but see you got to start somewhere
[1:10:01] now how did you ever become a child of
[1:10:05] God how did you become a
[1:10:08] child well I always was I I'm I born a
[1:10:11] Son of
[1:10:12] God so was everybody in the world that's
[1:10:16] right
[1:10:19] that's everybody in the world was born
[1:10:22] the son of God right or a daughter of
[1:10:25] God because God is the only one that can
[1:10:28] give
[1:10:29] life but that don't give you eternal
[1:10:32] life just because that
[1:10:34] you are a child of God God is the only
[1:10:37] creator of Life Satan cannot give your
[1:10:39] soul he can't do those things he can
[1:10:42] only pervert right so every person
[1:10:45] that's born into the world is a child of
[1:10:49] God by natural birth because God gave us
[1:10:52] life
[1:10:54] amen all right right so now that solves
[1:10:59] that problem so we're all a child of God
[1:11:02] by natural
[1:11:04] birth all right but now that's why Jesus
[1:11:07] told Nicodemus he said you must be born
[1:11:09] again he said yeah but my natural birth
[1:11:12] made me a Son of God he said you don't
[1:11:15] get in the Kingdom I'm talking about
[1:11:17] right with that form of terminology
[1:11:21] right you got to be born again amen
[1:11:26] man see
[1:11:29] then had he made it to theost he'd been
[1:11:32] all right right okay but now listen to
[1:11:35] what I'm trying to
[1:11:38] say you said but I was born the child of
[1:11:41] God that's in the message now see I
[1:11:44] always was eternal and and all this that
[1:11:46] and the other that's that's up to them
[1:11:48] you know say I believe you must receive
[1:11:51] eternal life I'm just sorry that's the
[1:11:53] way I believe it amen if you don't
[1:11:55] believe it turn your computer off click
[1:11:57] it off it don't it won't give me one
[1:12:00] dime and help me no
[1:12:03] popularity just you know forget it you
[1:12:07] don't listen to somebody else listen to
[1:12:10] them but if you want to talk about the
[1:12:13] truth so I believe in an oldfashioned
[1:12:15] form of Salvation
[1:12:18] amen that's right I believe you must be
[1:12:22] justified right
[1:12:24] right I believe you must repent of your
[1:12:27] sins and be that chopped off your pie
[1:12:29] sins and you must re then by doing that
[1:12:32] you must go to the water and get
[1:12:34] baptized and if you refuse to get
[1:12:36] baptized your repentance is not genuine
[1:12:38] right right amen that's how I
[1:12:42] believe then you must continue on to a
[1:12:45] state of
[1:12:46] sanctification the cleansing and setting
[1:12:48] aside amen and then you must receive the
[1:12:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[1:12:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you a
[1:12:55] child of God in the kingdom of God
[1:12:59] you're not talking about just sunship
[1:13:01] because of creation you're talking about
[1:13:03] a new creation you're talking about
[1:13:06] being born again in the body of Jesus
[1:13:11] Christ see because we get into scripture
[1:13:13] you go through all if you want to in
[1:13:15] Ephesians let's read just a little
[1:13:18] bit in Ephesians
[1:13:21] 2 let's see let make sure scripture yeah
[1:13:24] two all
[1:13:29] right let's see what Paul thought about
[1:13:32] us verse one and you have he quickened
[1:13:35] who were dead in trespasses and
[1:13:40] sin oh I always was eternal I just feel
[1:13:46] it what he said well Paul says you were
[1:13:48] dead in trespasses and sin right all
[1:13:51] right says we in time pass you walked
[1:13:55] according to the course of this world
[1:13:58] Amen now you remember that yeah
[1:14:06] right according to the prince of the
[1:14:08] power of the iron now who's the who's
[1:14:10] the prince of power that's
[1:14:13] Satan the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:14:16] children of disobedience in other words
[1:14:18] the same thing that's in the children of
[1:14:21] Disobedience Within You and I
[1:14:25] right Paul as we were talking about last
[1:14:27] night said that there was murderers
[1:14:30] adulterers wh mongers all kind of things
[1:14:32] read there in the scripture and he said
[1:14:34] and such were some of you that's right
[1:14:37] but said now you are clean
[1:14:40] amen mean why cuz you're born again
[1:14:44] right right
[1:14:47] amen among whom also we all and I got a
[1:14:50] great big square around mine right there
[1:14:53] had our conversation in 's P in the lust
[1:14:57] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:15:00] the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[1:15:02] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:15:06] others but Paul you ain't never heard
[1:15:09] brother
[1:15:11] brandham brother Bram said always was
[1:15:14] eternal so I tell you what brother BR
[1:15:16] said I ain't listen to you
[1:15:18] Paul preach brother right is that the
[1:15:22] way people are oh my
[1:15:24] now if brother Brown was contrary to
[1:15:26] Paul then Paul was wrong and brother
[1:15:27] Brown's wrong or both of them was wrong
[1:15:29] right cuz they both can't be right if
[1:15:31] they're in opposite direction right
[1:15:34] that's just blunt and plain language
[1:15:37] right all right drop on down where we
[1:15:39] get the sa but look at verse
[1:15:42] 11 wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:15:45] times past Gentiles In the Flesh who are
[1:15:48] called uncircumcision by that which is
[1:15:50] called a circumcision the flesh made by
[1:15:52] hands
[1:15:53] that at that time you were without
[1:15:57] Christ being aliens from the
[1:16:00] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:16:02] from the covenants of Promise having no
[1:16:05] hope and without God right in the
[1:16:11] world now what is it I got it in here
[1:16:15] right somewhere Galatians I
[1:16:17] think where is the one where it says in
[1:16:20] adoption pertained unto Israel
[1:16:24] see we have no right right now I want to
[1:16:27] finish that up in just a few minutes of
[1:16:29] just talking about that and we'll just
[1:16:30] stay right here on this see we we
[1:16:32] haven't talked about the New Birth now
[1:16:33] we're just talking about water baptism
[1:16:36] and things we're going
[1:16:38] through see then the children of Israel
[1:16:41] had to be chosen
[1:16:44] yep
[1:16:47] right everybody was a child of God by
[1:16:50] natural creation right but God chose a
[1:16:53] group of people
[1:16:56] Y and connected himself to that and
[1:16:59] called him his wife right or his people
[1:17:02] or his
[1:17:05] children he adopted them y
[1:17:09] right he chose
[1:17:12] him he chose Israel he adopted Israel
[1:17:15] but see you and I didn't even have any
[1:17:17] right of that that's what Paul's
[1:17:19] explaining right we were
[1:17:21] Gentiles no
[1:17:24] whatsoever the adoption was what was
[1:17:27] pertaining to
[1:17:28] Israel in other words Israel should have
[1:17:31] went on through in the fact of receiving
[1:17:34] Jesus Christ as their savior the new
[1:17:37] birth and then should have went on to
[1:17:40] mount of transfiguration
[1:17:43] experience and then went on to the
[1:17:46] change of the body
[1:17:49] y but they turned it down right
[1:17:55] it become a gentile dispensation right
[1:17:58] now not every Jew turned it
[1:18:01] down
[1:18:03] right that's why it's called a gentile
[1:18:05] dispensation which it means All Nations
[1:18:08] but Israel as a whole rejected Jesus
[1:18:10] Christ amen even rejected this sunship
[1:18:14] adoptions and things right it was
[1:18:17] pertaineth unto them we were
[1:18:19] aliens that's
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:23] Y and didn't come up with that new word
[1:18:24] in Ni last days you know talking about
[1:18:26] illegal aliens and aliens from outter
[1:18:28] space and and this that and the other
[1:18:31] that was in the Bible
[1:18:34] right and you look up back there and you
[1:18:36] find out illegal aliens means somebody
[1:18:38] is here illegally and that's why they
[1:18:40] call them an alien you know or or an
[1:18:43] alien from out of space means they're
[1:18:44] not from here so then Israel was an a I
[1:18:47] mean we were an alien Gentiles right we
[1:18:50] had no
[1:18:51] promise right
[1:18:54] nothing pertaining to the Gentiles right
[1:18:59] but God true Mercy if you went on
[1:19:00] reading below there thank you Lord
[1:19:03] amen gave us an opportunity
[1:19:07] right to be able to come become the
[1:19:09] children of
[1:19:11] God Amen to be able to be born again
[1:19:14] that would make us a child of
[1:19:17] God and if you're not born again you're
[1:19:19] not a child of God right I don't care
[1:19:22] how much you claim church I don't care
[1:19:23] how much you claim how good you are
[1:19:24] whatever all that's wonderful all that's
[1:19:26] well and
[1:19:28] good but Nicodemus had every bit of that
[1:19:32] almighty God said you got to go down you
[1:19:35] under yep in other words let me say this
[1:19:38] and we'll finish you
[1:19:41] Nicodemus come the way I've
[1:19:48] come right was that what he saying to
[1:19:51] him come the way I've come right
[1:19:54] Nicodemus are you willing that's like I
[1:19:56] said it's not written in the Bible all
[1:19:57] the things that take place right
[1:20:00] right reckon it could have been Jesus
[1:20:02] said Nicodemus what you need to do
[1:20:06] first maybe after Nicodemus got through
[1:20:08] saying you mean I got to go back to my
[1:20:09] mother's W I got to do this that and the
[1:20:11] other and Jesus said Nicodemus what I
[1:20:13] need to do said you need to meet John
[1:20:15] the
[1:20:17] Baptist now hey I know the story by then
[1:20:20] he was already crucified don't get be
[1:20:22] garbage okay get to
[1:20:26] Point Jesus could have said to Nicodemus
[1:20:28] what you need to do is meet me down to
[1:20:30] water right in front of everybody down
[1:20:33] there on River streets you know right in
[1:20:34] the middle of Ohio River you know or
[1:20:37] something where be right out in the
[1:20:38] public you
[1:20:39] know and said we'll we'll start you off
[1:20:42] in the right
[1:20:43] way said we'll baptize
[1:20:47] you Nicodemus went
[1:20:50] away rejected that right
[1:20:53] right right so he wouldn't follow it
[1:20:57] what about you and me what about our
[1:20:58] word
[1:21:00] baptism I've baptized a lot of people
[1:21:02] over because that they said to me and
[1:21:05] they come along later in life and say
[1:21:07] brother Dale I really don't I really
[1:21:10] didn't uh understand about baptism I
[1:21:13] just done it because everybody else was
[1:21:14] doing it right you know I just done it
[1:21:17] because it maybe the preacher told me I
[1:21:19] needed to do it well I've baptized a lot
[1:21:21] of people over again right
[1:21:25] and I'm like this if you were baptized
[1:21:28] in the name of Jesus Christ but
[1:21:29] believing that your water baptism was
[1:21:31] under regeneration like the people that
[1:21:34] baptized they people baptized in the
[1:21:36] name of Jesus Christ even Lord Jesus
[1:21:38] Christ and believing that your water
[1:21:40] baptism is under regeneration I'm just
[1:21:44] as honest as it can be if I was you I'd
[1:21:46] get baptized again right brother asked
[1:21:49] me that question one time and I answered
[1:21:51] it I I said what was your Doctrine he
[1:21:54] said we believed in water baptism under
[1:21:55] regeneration I said I would if I was you
[1:21:58] I'd go get baptized in the name of the
[1:22:00] Lord Jesus Christ and get away from that
[1:22:02] Doctrine right well I don't believe the
[1:22:04] doctrine no more no no but my
[1:22:07] identification right that's it you see I
[1:22:10] want to be identified with Jesus
[1:22:15] Christ my brother come down through
[1:22:17] there one day and was baptizing a bunch
[1:22:18] of people he said you ought to be
[1:22:19] ashamed of yourself baptizing them
[1:22:21] people and he wasn't he wasn't sarcastic
[1:22:24] he wasn't he was no racist or nothing
[1:22:27] but it's just what he said he said you
[1:22:28] baptizing them black people he said
[1:22:30] there coming out of that water white as
[1:22:31] could be he said that froze to
[1:22:34] death I said yeah but we was doing
[1:22:37] it and he wasn't throwing off on Races
[1:22:41] he wasn't that way he was just saying
[1:22:44] here I am right you are right out there
[1:22:46] doing that why don't you come down here
[1:22:47] and get some church and do it they
[1:22:50] wouldn't do it back then you know right
[1:22:52] I mean you going to go down to Baptist
[1:22:54] Church and ask permission to use your
[1:22:55] baptistry going to baptize the people in
[1:22:57] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're
[1:22:58] not going to get in there that's just
[1:23:00] plain language you just might as well go
[1:23:02] get you River and take care of it but
[1:23:05] you see I want to be identified
[1:23:07] right I'm like Martin Luther they said
[1:23:09] Martin Luther don't you know that the
[1:23:11] whole world is against you he said I
[1:23:13] want the whole world to know that I'm
[1:23:16] against
[1:23:20] them but I'm trying to get you to see
[1:23:23] the
[1:23:25] Simplicity of the life and journey now
[1:23:28] listen I'll keep repeating this okay
[1:23:31] your life and your journey in travel is
[1:23:34] what God is looking
[1:23:37] at and why can't we believe that we've
[1:23:39] come through these
[1:23:45] things we want to make statements you
[1:23:47] know and I was looking today in there
[1:23:49] and we
[1:23:50] say in adop brother Rand will say so
[1:23:53] your children are out there wearing
[1:23:57] shorts so well they wasn't Christians
[1:24:00] see we like to do that don't
[1:24:02] we you know he said there
[1:24:07] Christians you going have to argue with
[1:24:11] him well you believe you can go out no
[1:24:14] that's we're different
[1:24:17] now but you know there was a time back
[1:24:19] there when you done a lot of things that
[1:24:21] you claimed a new birth
[1:24:23] and you done a lot of things that you
[1:24:25] don't do
[1:24:26] now
[1:24:29] right well did you become a Christian
[1:24:32] later or was you a
[1:24:35] Christian brother Brandon was a straight
[1:24:37] honest man he said your Christians are
[1:24:40] going out here forming
[1:24:43] organizations pulling apart and
[1:24:45] dividing now I'm quoting him cuz I was
[1:24:48] just looking at it he said the the
[1:24:51] congregational Hess he said they had the
[1:24:53] baptism of the Holy
[1:24:56] Ghost he said the Church of God he said
[1:24:58] they had the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:02] Ghost he said the Oneness had the
[1:25:04] baptism of the Holy
[1:25:13] Ghost you see yeah but I just don't see
[1:25:15] how they that's what I'm saying you're
[1:25:17] you're taking your own intellectual
[1:25:19] conception and not looking at the
[1:25:21] children of God
[1:25:23] and just remember there is no big sin
[1:25:26] and little
[1:25:28] sin so if we're going to dechristianize
[1:25:32] everybody then we'll have to
[1:25:34] dechristianize ourselves first he said
[1:25:36] well they didn't come on to the message
[1:25:37] well now if they didn't come on the
[1:25:39] message they prove what they had right
[1:25:41] exactly right amen
[1:25:46] right that's why I love what the prophet
[1:25:48] had to say one day and it really struck
[1:25:50] me I knew where the bad just laid in the
[1:25:53] lines back there and the days and hours
[1:25:55] they
[1:25:56] lived their doctrines and ideas but as
[1:26:00] long about somewhere in the late 50s or
[1:26:02] might be even early 60s he said the
[1:26:04] Baptist is just now become a
[1:26:11] denomination and I thought Lord I
[1:26:14] thought it was a couple hundred years
[1:26:16] ago but you see when they turn down his
[1:26:19] message
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:23] they all become denominations they died
[1:26:25] when they turned down his message there
[1:26:28] was honest hearted people still in there
[1:26:29] until he come along with it so when the
[1:26:32] prophet says that they're
[1:26:37] Christians you got to say they're
[1:26:43] Christians just say what he says they're
[1:26:46] Christians but then we prove what we are
[1:26:48] cuz we don't go on with the
[1:26:50] truth we just take it
[1:26:52] stages of your
[1:26:55] adoption and we just talking about water
[1:26:59] baptism but you know that's something
[1:27:01] I've lived through come on brother
[1:27:04] that's something we've all lived through
[1:27:06] right right right amen and you know God
[1:27:09] looks back there and he's pleased with
[1:27:16] that see we won we won't take that and
[1:27:19] bring it down to ourselves where it says
[1:27:21] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:27:22] pleased to
[1:27:24] dwell we want all of this big thing well
[1:27:27] be under but we don't look at it as
[1:27:29] simple life that we're
[1:27:32] living right what's keeping you from
[1:27:35] going out into the world
[1:27:41] today let's thing that's right what's
[1:27:44] keeping you from going out in the world
[1:27:45] of sin
[1:27:50] today I thought it baptism of the Holy
[1:27:53] Ghost that's right I thought it was
[1:27:55] Christ in you the hope of glory of what
[1:27:56] was doing it I thought that's what led
[1:27:59] us
[1:28:01] here
[1:28:04] you and then we don't think something's
[1:28:06] been going
[1:28:10] on see we're always looking forward or
[1:28:13] Looking Backward we can look backward
[1:28:15] and we can see brother branam and we'd
[1:28:16] say oh if we just had it like that and
[1:28:18] look forward out there and oh one of
[1:28:20] these days we get into Glory and fail to
[1:28:22] see what's going
[1:28:25] on I want to make adoption so
[1:28:30] simple until we can see that that's
[1:28:32] what's taking place something has been
[1:28:35] taking place right we're in a process
[1:28:38] amen sure I'm not where I want to
[1:28:42] be but I'm not where I used to
[1:28:47] be and just move on what we got 129
[1:28:50] anybody have need
