[0:02] amen good morning good morning praise
[0:05] the Lord amen thankful again to be in
[0:09] his house of
[0:13] worship we're going to read
[0:16] from Romans
[0:18] 8 amen 1 through
[0:28] 17
[0:40] let's pray heavenly father again this
[0:43] morning we are thankful Lord for the
[0:46] privilege and strength that you have
[0:48] given us Lord to come together to
[0:50] worship father we pray that all things
[0:53] that's not concerning your word Lord be
[0:56] cast from our minds at this time Lord
[0:58] that you would just lead us and bless us
[1:01] God give us strength to walk forth and
[1:03] hold fast to your word Lord let us
[1:05] recognize though that which is true Lord
[1:09] and that which is false Lord and hold to
[1:10] your word Lord let us have love and
[1:13] understanding one for another all those
[1:16] that don't understand you Lord we pray
[1:18] that you will bring your knowledge unto
[1:20] their hearts and Minds Lord and we thank
[1:23] you for this hour in this day and the
[1:25] words that we read Lord just let them
[1:27] find a place of rest in our hearts in
[1:29] Jesus Christ name we pray
[1:33] amen Romans 8 there is therefore now no
[1:37] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:40] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:43] after the spirit for the spirit of life
[1:47] in Christ Jesus made me free from the
[1:51] law of sin and
[1:52] death for what the law could not
[1:56] do in that it is weak through the flesh
[2:00] God sending his own son in the likeness
[2:02] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[2:06] sin in the
[2:07] flesh that the rightous of the LA might
[2:10] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[2:13] the flesh but after the
[2:16] spirit for they that are after The Flesh
[2:19] do mind the things of the flesh but they
[2:21] that are after the spirit the things of
[2:24] the
[2:25] spirit for to be Carly minded is death
[2:28] but to be
[2:30] mind is life and peace because the
[2:34] carnal mind is enity against God for it
[2:37] is not subject unto the law of God
[2:39] neither indeed can be
[2:43] so cannot
[2:46] God but ye are not in the flesh but in
[2:49] the
[2:50] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[2:53] dwelleth in you now if any man have not
[2:57] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[3:00] and Christ in you the body is of but the
[3:08] is but if the spirit of him that raised
[3:11] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[3:15] that raised up Christ from the dead
[3:17] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[3:20] his spirit that dwelleth in
[3:22] you there we are not to theh to live the
[3:30] for if you live after the flesh you
[3:31] shall die but if through the spirit do
[3:36] mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall
[3:40] live for as
[3:42] many spirit of
[3:46] God for ye have not received the spirit
[3:49] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[3:52] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[3:54] we cry AB Our
[3:56] Father Spirit itself bear Witness with
[4:00] our we are the children of God if
[4:05] children

[5:50] all right Heavenly Father we thank you
[5:53] Lord that you have given us an
[5:56] opportunity first to believe you
[6:01] then an opportunity to serve you and
[6:04] then an opportunity to know and realize
[6:06] that you're God and you change not by

[6:42] sure we'll go to Joel
[6:48] 223 be glad then ye children of Zion and
[6:51] rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath
[6:54] given you the former Reign moderately
[6:55] and he will cause to come down for you
[6:58] the rain the former r rain and the
[7:00] latter rain in the first month and the
[7:03] floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat
[7:05] shall overflow with wine and oil and I
[7:08] will restore to you the years that the C
[7:11] the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm the
[7:14] caterpillar the pmer worm my great Army
[7:17] which I sent among you and you shall eat
[7:19] in plenty and be satisfied and praise
[7:22] the name of your the Lord your God that
[7:25] hath dealt wondrously with you and my
[7:28] people shall not be ashamed all right
[7:32] let's uh we can keep on going but we
[7:35] know what it is that he promised the
[7:37] outpouring of the spirit all right and
[7:41] we know that took place back under then
[7:45] it took place you know of the time but
[7:48] just to save time reading let's go over
[7:50] to Jeremiah now and remember what we
[7:52] read up here in verse
[7:55] 23 of Joel it talks about the former and
[7:58] the latter rign
[8:00] and then the promise of
[8:01] restoration all right the promise of
[8:05] restoration see but then he spoke of a
[8:08] for and L all right then the promise of
[8:10] restoration but now look what he
[8:14] says in Jeremiah
[8:16] 3:3 therefore the showers have been
[8:20] withholden and there hath been no latter
[8:23] rain and thou Hast a forehead
[8:27] thou refuses to be ashamed you may be
[8:30] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[8:33] reading of the word now we
[8:38] spoke last
[8:40] weekend
[8:42] on a Revival and I hope you followed and
[8:48] listened to what I had to say about the
[8:52] things that I believe in all and uh I
[8:57] I'm I've always been one to try to take
[9:00] everything the prophet says not just uh
[9:03] get a a certain thing you know and get a
[9:06] part and say well he said this well I I
[9:10] love to keep on reading to find other
[9:12] things that are said and in doing that
[9:16] then we can put it together and it comes
[9:18] out to be a beautiful picture but you
[9:20] can take anything you want to uh of the
[9:23] prophet of any point or thought whatever
[9:26] or the Bible you know and and you can
[9:29] make it say anything you want to and you
[9:32] can say well I said what the Bible
[9:35] said well that's true but you know how
[9:39] the prophet said that one day he said
[9:41] the Bible
[9:43] says Judas went and hung
[9:45] hisself then he took another scripture
[9:47] and says you go do likewise so then you
[9:50] can say well I said what the Bible said
[9:53] all right but see to put it together and
[9:56] bring it together in a complete form to
[9:59] where that you can take everything the
[10:01] prophet said about that
[10:04] subject and uh be able to
[10:08] uh come out with a
[10:10] conclusion because if you can't then you
[10:13] don't know what you're talking about you
[10:15] said well I I said what the Bible said
[10:17] or I said what the prophet said well
[10:19] that's
[10:20] wonderful that's good but that's the pro
[10:23] what did he say that's just being able
[10:26] to read amen all right you say but but
[10:29] I'll just stick with what this right
[10:31] here well you know the reason you stick
[10:32] with that right there is because what
[10:34] you've been previously taught
[10:37] right huh what you've been previously
[10:40] taught whether you like it or not or
[10:43] want to admit it is still in your brain
[10:46] right you cannot erase it you were
[10:50] taught of
[10:51] Trinity you know all right and you were
[10:54] taught nobody can
[10:57] understand well then by doing that then
[11:00] that shuts off your mind
[11:02] to the point of trying to
[11:05] receive all right it sets you in a
[11:08] position that you won't
[11:10] listen and uh you know cuz you say well
[11:15] I I I just stay with what the prophet
[11:17] said I just be simple well be simple and
[11:20] be stupid that's very little between the
[11:23] two you know and then you put it
[11:26] together and be simply stupid that
[11:27] really does get to be a bad problem
[11:29] problem but the I've always tried to get
[11:32] you to look at everything to take all
[11:35] that the prophet had said about the
[11:37] topic you know and bring it together and
[11:41] even though it may sound uh
[11:45] contrary but it will come together if
[11:47] you'll give it time and then even like
[11:50] you'd say well the prophet talked the
[11:52] white horse rider was the was the Holy
[11:55] Ghost then he changed later you can't
[11:57] put those two no you can't put those
[11:58] those two together because that was one
[12:00] thing that could not be uh remember
[12:04] until the seals broke nobody in the
[12:06] world was responsible for knowing about
[12:09] that white horse
[12:12] rider even though Clarence Lin before
[12:14] then said the white horse rider was the
[12:16] Antichrist that's before brother
[12:18] branham's time but he was not a prophet
[12:20] see he couldn't bring it and like I said
[12:23] until the seals
[12:24] broke you can't say the prophet was
[12:27] wrong right he was just lack of
[12:30] understanding right but then when he
[12:32] come to the point of of you know it
[12:35] being presented then he accepted what
[12:37] was presented and that's all I've ever
[12:39] tried to get all of us to do is accept
[12:42] what's presented go home think about it
[12:45] study it over and
[12:47] see all right and that way we can
[12:50] understand all right see we went
[12:53] through you know and showed how that the
[12:57] prophet said the Revival is
[12:59] over he said America rejected the gospel
[13:03] in 56 and he said that's thus sayith the
[13:05] Lord will we believe
[13:07] that the worldwide sweeping Revival is
[13:11] over there'll never be another worldwide
[13:14] sweeping Revival he said they're looking
[13:16] at the two witnesses and the things to
[13:19] Israel remember we brought that
[13:21] out looking at the two witnesses and the
[13:24] the closing heavens and the doing things
[13:27] you know but remember now even that
[13:30] Revival will not be a worldwide sweeping
[13:32] Revival it'll only be a Revival to
[13:35] Israel amen it won't be for anybody else
[13:38] all right but see then we're not looking
[13:40] for a great sweeping
[13:44] Revival and see we could say well I I
[13:47] said what the prophet said Revival's
[13:50] over well what about where the Prophet
[13:52] said the bride hasn't had a Revival
[13:57] yet youen remember that was out of the
[13:59] seal
[14:00] book said she hadn't had a Revival yet
[14:03] said it take those seven unknown
[14:04] Thunders to wake her up
[14:07] well well I us don't see how that can
[14:10] fit together with this all I know but
[14:12] see it's over for the
[14:15] world y he said you say the Revival's
[14:20] over he said it's not
[14:22] over he said let's go forward you
[14:25] remember that let's go forward he said
[14:28] it's not
[14:30] over see but the worldwide sweeping
[14:33] Revival is over
[14:36] yeah all
[14:38] right but why is it that we can't have a
[14:41] Revival of our own like he said and see
[14:44] you say well that was worldwide sweeping
[14:46] Revival that he was speaking of back in
[14:48] the 56 was over with cuz he said then
[14:51] you know he said I predict that they'll
[14:53] reject the gospel and he said and they
[14:55] did but there in 56
[14:59] he said a Revival amongst the elect
[15:04] right
[15:06] amen of Revival amongst the
[15:11] elect amen see then the Revival that he
[15:14] was speaking of when he was speaking in
[15:16] the seal book that said the bride hadn't
[15:18] had a Revival yet that's not going to be
[15:20] for the world Amen that's going to be
[15:23] only for the
[15:27] elect then brother Dale are you looking
[15:29] for a Revival
[15:31] no I've been I've been in one ever since
[15:33] I've been in this
[15:35] message but see you're looking for a
[15:37] Revival to sweep out and hospitals
[15:39] emptied and and all of this that and the
[15:42] other you say well we got where the
[15:44] Prophet said there won't be no empty in
[15:46] hospital no but he didn't say you
[15:47] couldn't empty a
[15:49] room now come
[15:51] on he didn't say you could go you're not
[15:54] to go in there and pray for people I'm
[15:55] not going to hospital and pray for
[15:56] nobody cuz might empty the
[15:59] hospital
[16:01] now don't be that
[16:03] exalted that won't work out too good you
[16:07] know all right but you see we look at
[16:11] something and we set in our mind what we
[16:14] think and then when somebody's contrary
[16:17] to that we just cut it off you we just
[16:21] cut off their thoughts and don't
[16:25] listen but you see that's where that
[16:27] I've always said said if you don't agree
[16:30] with me come and give me something
[16:31] contrary to what I've said that's
[16:35] right well if you don't agree with me
[16:39] you're Duty bound to come and tell me
[16:43] that you don't agree with me
[16:46] or shed
[16:49] up you remember at the weddings when you
[16:52] asked the thing if
[16:54] it's anybody here got any
[16:57] reason that this wedding shouldn't go
[17:00] on Speak now or
[17:03] whatever forever hold your peace well
[17:06] had a brother say something about that
[17:08] one time to me about a wedding and I
[17:10] said uh hold it brother you was the best
[17:13] man and I said you said there's
[17:15] something wrong with
[17:17] that yeah I said well you was the best
[17:19] man why didn't you raise your hand I
[17:22] said in other words shut up I don't want
[17:24] to hear it again and I
[17:26] don't because see that's what you're
[17:28] supposed to be but yet that don't work
[17:32] he everybody got to y
[17:34] y we'll get to that in a little while in
[17:36] the message and see but do you
[17:39] understand what I'm getting at I believe
[17:42] there is to be and is now going on the
[17:46] greatest
[17:48] Revival of all
[17:50] revivals
[17:53] now all the great things that had
[17:56] happened all the great movement of God
[17:58] and the sick healed and the the dead
[18:00] raised and the things like that I
[18:02] believe the greatest Revival is now in
[18:05] effect to the elect amen right right but
[18:09] you know what that can be somebody
[18:11] sitting right there on the Pew right
[18:12] beside of you can be in a Revival and
[18:15] you're sitting there dead as a doornail
[18:17] that's right
[18:18] amen right amen and not know what in the
[18:22] world's going on that's why I said when
[18:25] I came into the message and saw what the
[18:27] prophet was saying
[18:29] I've been in a Revival ever since
[18:30] because I love for him to speak
[18:33] something to
[18:35] me you know and I I love to keep things
[18:39] dangling kind of in front of you I asked
[18:42] question yesterday I said they had a cup
[18:44] of water there I said is that water on
[18:46] the inside or is that water on the
[18:54] outside I said which one is
[18:57] it when it's on the inside we saw them
[19:00] poured in there well they got optical
[19:03] illusions I guess is the word for you
[19:05] ever seen those things that a spet
[19:07] sitting out in midair and not hooked up
[19:09] to nothing and water running out of it
[19:12] ever seen one of
[19:14] those I mean you're going to get up
[19:15] there and get a hold of it to find out
[19:17] what's going
[19:18] on because to look at it it looks like
[19:22] it it's just sitting there in mid iron
[19:23] water's coming out of
[19:25] nowhere you never seen one of them
[19:30] optical
[19:32] illusions we'll get to that this
[19:34] afternoon all but
[19:37] now what I want to cover today is one
[19:40] thought I hope I've made myself clear
[19:44] I'm looking for a Revival to the Bride
[19:46] of Jesus Christ the greatest Revival do
[19:49] you mean it's going to end up with less
[19:51] than what we
[19:54] start you
[19:56] know I mean is it going end up to be
[19:59] less than what you start with you mean
[20:01] everything in the Bible would speak of
[20:03] the end time yeah do you agree with that
[20:08] that's right you mean all that's been
[20:10] down through there all the great things
[20:13] that's happened and yet we're just well
[20:16] I'm just waiting on bus pull up you one
[20:19] of these days something going to happen
[20:23] get well what about you amen brother
[20:28] they ain't waiting on a bus I'm waiting
[20:30] on an
[20:31] airplane we'll get you a jet and go to
[20:34] work but
[20:36] listen be serious this is life or
[20:41] death we're not coming to church I hope
[20:43] you understand I thought everything back
[20:46] there pointed to
[20:48] this I thought everything was waiting on
[20:50] you and I of course we don't believe
[20:55] that so now you see and when we get to
[20:58] it in a
[20:59] minute you'll see what I'm talking
[21:02] about you'll see that
[21:05] spirit that takes us away from the
[21:08] revealed
[21:10] word is what's killing us and binding
[21:12] the holy
[21:16] spirit cuz come on if that statement
[21:18] ain't right I want somebody get up show
[21:20] me I'll just quit then you get up come
[21:23] on show me I'm wrong I'll quit I'll
[21:25] never preach another sermon you got my
[21:27] word on that
[21:29] if you can show me that everything
[21:31] before us all of that back there all the
[21:35] whole Bible is not pointing at this time
[21:38] for you and I to make a change of the
[21:41] body walk over this Earth in a Rapture
[21:44] and you tell me this is not the greatest
[21:50] day well I don't see nothing going on
[21:54] what's that got to do with
[21:57] it
[22:00] what does that got to do with
[22:01] it yeah but if we had it we'd have I
[22:05] stood up last night and
[22:07] testified at the fellowship
[22:09] meeting of two Miracle
[22:13] babies and about a young couple that
[22:16] would come to church with their
[22:18] baby laying in intensive care on life
[22:23] support but yet they came to
[22:26] church
[22:29] you know what God touched the
[22:32] child but nothing's going
[22:36] on you'll never see all of those things
[22:39] like that but why can't we believe if
[22:41] everything back there is not pointing at
[22:43] us then we better turn around and get to
[22:45] pointing back you
[22:48] know this is the greatest day that's
[22:51] ever
[22:53] been the end of all things the Bible
[22:56] said has come upon us right amen
[23:02] yeah but but look what's fixing happen
[23:04] look what what if he live back there in
[23:06] the Dark Ages and they took you out and
[23:07] cut your belly open and fed you to the
[23:11] Hogs took the babies and cut them out of
[23:14] the mothers and throw them to the Hogs
[23:16] all in the name of
[23:18] religion brother I don't think that's
[23:21] going to happen again what if it
[23:24] does you're I don't think it's going to
[23:27] happen ain't going to stop
[23:31] it but the faith to believe God's word
[23:34] and be
[23:39] prepared to where we can understand
[23:41] what's going on
[23:43] Amen you look at the people of this
[23:45] message and if you think it a it ain't
[23:47] been right about what I've said all
[23:48] these years because this ain't the first
[23:50] time I spoke about the things we're
[23:52] going to talk about how the Holy Ghost
[23:53] has been bound for 2,000
[23:55] years you realize if that's statement is
[23:58] correct then it really was not free on
[24:00] the day of Pentecost the way God wanted
[24:02] it to be free or else your Prophet was
[24:11] wrong it's because you've always had
[24:14] Satan
[24:16] involved in the whole
[24:19] situation see but I wrote this like this
[24:26] say why are part not
[24:30] people getting a Revival or experiencing
[24:37] one they are not taught to expect one
[24:46] right come on might quiet on that ain't
[24:52] it they're not taught to expect one or
[24:55] what are they taught to expect some oh I
[24:58] want a Revival I want a Revival well
[25:00] what do you
[25:02] mean well I want to see the power of God
[25:05] come down in the building and US
[25:06] shouting speaking tongues and screaming
[25:08] Glory Hallelujah and shout all over the
[25:11] place that's what most people think of
[25:13] Revival
[25:18] is I
[25:20] thought that a
[25:23] Revival was to
[25:26] revive
[25:28] what you already
[25:30] had I didn't know it was to shout Glory
[25:33] Hallelujah that's the effects of
[25:38] it right that's the effects of
[25:41] it you're wanting to go back to some
[25:44] kind of a form when it's all pointed to
[25:46] here amen
[25:49] right and this is the day and the hour
[25:52] that God has looked forward
[25:56] to to bring his bride to a place that
[25:58] they could believe his word and stand on
[26:01] his word irregardless of what anything
[26:03] takes
[26:06] place now I just don't see nothing going
[26:10] on
[26:13] yeah but
[26:16] listen why are you not expecting a
[26:23] Revival why can't you say you're
[26:25] experiencing
[26:26] one you realize revive means to row over
[26:31] and each time you get a revelation
[26:33] you're being
[26:37] revived
[26:40] right when the Lord revealed something
[26:42] to you you're getting
[26:44] revived Lord showed me something
[26:46] Wednesday night when Wade was preaching
[26:47] Lord willing I'll try to get to it this
[26:50] afternoon and
[26:52] uh you
[26:54] know talk about it a little
[26:56] bit
[26:59] you see I enjoy when the Lord speaks to
[27:02] me abely amen you know and you know
[27:07] sometimes it's very
[27:08] rare and you know sometimes I have to go
[27:11] quite a while waiting for any speak to
[27:13] me again you
[27:19] know but what about you what are you
[27:24] expecting you know what now let's make
[27:27] the statement and then I'll get off of
[27:28] that part of you're going to get what
[27:30] you
[27:34] expect you're going to get what you
[27:37] expect
[27:39] right because you're expecting it well
[27:42] God can't do anything other than what
[27:43] you expect him he cannot override our
[27:46] free moral agency that's right amen
[27:49] don't worry about it it's not going to
[27:50] sweep the
[27:52] world you know my you know I have said
[27:55] this there was certain brother used to
[27:57] come around cuz he wrote a lot of
[27:58] letters and and i' say God please don't
[28:00] do nothing while that man's here cuz if
[28:03] he do then it's going to fill this
[28:04] church up and we're going to have to
[28:05] build
[28:06] on he said well you're you're I know
[28:09] what I agree with you I'm a funny
[28:13] person but you know I've come to realize
[28:16] we could have right here in
[28:17] Lula the dead raised every
[28:21] day and it wouldn't add one person to
[28:23] this
[28:26] building
[28:28] if it did it'd be denominational people
[28:30] that didn't know anything about the word
[28:33] that come in to see the
[28:35] effects don't worry about
[28:38] it but
[28:41] listen are you expecting a Revival or
[28:45] are you experiencing a Revival want to
[28:48] get that
[28:49] point there's a lot of difference in the
[28:52] two you're expecting something means you
[28:55] do not have in your possession
[28:59] or you would not be expecting it
[29:03] right but if you say I'm experiencing it
[29:05] well now what's been our thought for 6
[29:08] months or more now positive
[29:12] attitude talking
[29:14] about that only the people in the Bible
[29:17] that ever amounted to anything was
[29:19] people that God spoke to and gave an
[29:21] experience or
[29:23] something
[29:26] right well why not start expecting
[29:30] something to take place you know what it
[29:32] might surprise you take
[29:34] place you
[29:39] know well we sat around this home drum
[29:41] and not expecting nothing well then
[29:42] that's what we're going to get right a
[29:45] man on the radio one time years ago and
[29:47] he was talking about his Blessing plan
[29:49] that he said you got to take it and you
[29:51] know put it to work and uh his great
[29:55] plan that he was talking about all right
[30:01] now he's made a statement he said
[30:03] nothing from nothing leaves nothing
[30:06] right and you know what I believe that
[30:12] yeah you know nothing from nothing
[30:16] leaves nothing we're getting a PL plop
[30:19] around up here so somebody have to chase
[30:20] it down they're working on it all right
[30:26] now but
[30:31] listen why is the Revival not taking
[30:39] effect right let's just read a few
[30:42] things and to see what your Prophet had
[30:45] to say about why and that's why we read
[30:49] the
[30:50] scripture that he promised a for and
[30:52] latter rign Joel amen right
[30:57] he gave the the doings and the you know
[31:00] the outpouring of the spirit the
[31:02] different
[31:03] things he talked of those things and
[31:08] you let's try to swap in a battery or do
[31:11] something or whatever we got something
[31:13] wrong with this system but now as I said
[31:19] Joel
[31:22] promised these
[31:23] things all
[31:25] right but then Jeremiah
[31:28] said it is going to be
[31:32] withholding
[31:34] right
[31:36] why I remember years ago I spoke on that
[31:40] and uh
[31:43] sister brother Harris's little
[31:45] daughter she couldn't understand so she
[31:49] wanted to know what was a horse forehead
[31:51] you know then I had to explain that you
[31:54] know what was a horse forehead
[31:57] and uh it all come out I hope to the
[32:01] right understanding but you know but
[32:04] that's what it says in in uh
[32:07] Jeremiah says because thou Hast a horse
[32:11] forehead that's the reason you don't
[32:14] have to stay there get turned on that's
[32:16] the
[32:17] reason that there's he's withholding the
[32:20] rain y right now we went through in the
[32:25] message last week that brother browner's
[32:28] message is the former Reign amen right
[32:31] amen I've been listening to it about
[32:33] three times this week on the spoken word
[32:35] Original Seed where he says you know
[32:38] talks about the former and latter rain
[32:41] and and things and you know and remember
[32:43] he said you people say you've had a
[32:45] latter rain he said nonsense he said you
[32:48] hadn't had the former reain yet and then
[32:50] in the the doing he says this Prophet
[32:53] will preach for the from the beginning
[32:57] to the former Reign he calls
[33:02] it right well because that's his message
[33:06] his message was a teaching rain
[33:10] right the latter rain is a holy spirit
[33:13] to Quicken that all right so now you got
[33:17] to have the former so we've had that
[33:21] we've had the prophet's message we're
[33:23] not looking for another Prophet to come
[33:25] to to bring us a message or tell us
[33:27] where this message is wrong yeah you
[33:30] know and it should have been said this
[33:32] way or should that you know like they're
[33:34] doing
[33:36] today but to know and to see that the
[33:39] former Reign is planted by the prophet
[33:43] now I believe the five-fold ministry has
[33:45] to plant that rain amen I believe that
[33:49] that's why we stay with his message amen
[33:52] improve things by what he says cuz
[33:54] that's former Reign see what I'm saying
[33:57] to you God quickened to me this and that
[34:00] would be a latter rain in my
[34:02] understanding but when my words are
[34:03] being brought to you I can only speak of
[34:06] in a former rain form because it's a
[34:09] sewing
[34:11] rain and even Jesus when he was here on
[34:14] Earth as we'll get two more this evening
[34:16] he told Nicodemus he said you must be
[34:18] born
[34:20] again now that was a former Reign that
[34:22] the man could in no way
[34:25] understand but the disciple on the day
[34:27] of Pentecost saw what Jesus was talking
[34:30] about because they had a latter rain and
[34:33] it quickened the things he had said and
[34:35] even taught them things to come the
[34:37] Bible said all right now so we're not
[34:41] looking for a former Reign to
[34:43] come you know a teaching Reign by
[34:46] somebody
[34:49] else now some of you blanked out so I'll
[34:52] say it
[34:53] again the prophet's message is a former
[34:55] Reign amen I believe that the fivefold
[34:59] ministry must sow that
[35:01] rain because it's left up to them that's
[35:05] what your Prophet said and the Bible
[35:07] says the fivefold ministry is for the
[35:09] perfecting of the Saints all right now
[35:12] but she has no message to bring other
[35:14] than what he brought right right all
[35:16] right amen but see then God brother
[35:19] brandom says only the spoken words
[35:20] written of see said God will be the
[35:23] latter rain to come and take the bride
[35:26] in the rapture amen all right so now
[35:29] let's talk about this what's what's the
[35:32] problem that horse
[35:34] forehead that's your understanding
[35:36] that's your
[35:37] intelligence so we're going to be
[35:39] dealing with this intelligence that we
[35:41] think is so
[35:43] great and we'll we'll try to get to it
[35:45] so go ahead with number one on hearing
[35:48] receiving and
[35:50] acting and look what the prophet had to
[35:53] say it's
[35:55] 196 uh
[35:58] 607 therefore the church needs a good
[36:01] cleansing what we need today is some
[36:04] oldfashioned Revival some sweeping
[36:06] revivals some power of the lord we need
[36:10] men and women who's willing to sell out
[36:13] to everything in this world to burn
[36:16] every bridge behind them we need to take
[36:19] the world today we ministers like the
[36:22] Norwegians used to take a
[36:25] country and what he says they done amen
[36:28] when they went in by ship they hit the
[36:30] shore and set the ship a fire and burned
[36:33] it behind
[36:34] them and nowhere to
[36:37] go he said now that's the way we need to
[36:39] be you said but brother Dale asked back
[36:41] there when when he didn't look for
[36:46] Revival now I I want you to tell me and
[36:48] show me where the Prophet ever said he
[36:51] wasn't looking for a
[36:52] Revival I've done went through that in
[36:54] two Services last Sunday to those on the
[36:57] internet if you ain't got enough
[36:58] gumption to go back and listen to it
[37:01] don't call me about
[37:02] quotes they're
[37:05] there because I tried my best to express
[37:08] express it the best way I could right
[37:11] about a Revival but look what he says he
[37:14] said we ought to be like that burn the
[37:16] ship behind
[37:20] us but now U let me say this without
[37:24] being too sarcastic
[37:27] if you can straighten brother brandom
[37:29] out and do the things the way the people
[37:30] are today you evidently didn't burn your
[37:33] ship
[37:36] yeah right right you evidently didn't
[37:39] burn your ship cuz you got back on the
[37:42] boat you got off of and you pull back
[37:45] out in the ocean right so you didn't
[37:47] burn it behind you right I don't have
[37:50] anything left over just in case this
[37:52] don't work and I don't have a Swedish
[37:55] Swedish bank account
[37:57] in case the money goes wrong and I got a
[37:59] little hold out you know I got all of my
[38:03] ducks in this row and it's going and
[38:06] it's been going ever since I've been in
[38:07] it so I ain't worried about where it's
[38:09] going all right look at the next one now
[38:13] think about we're talking
[38:15] about we need a Revival he
[38:19] says to sell out everything in the world
[38:23] but yet I admit you and me me me we're
[38:27] more worldly today than we've ever been
[38:29] we got more worldism than we've ever
[38:32] had it might not be wrong with a lot of
[38:34] worldism because that's the
[38:36] world but when we put worldism that's
[38:40] right
[38:42] ahead of the word of
[38:47] God like I said about Ryan and
[38:53] Gabby they came to church when their
[38:55] baby
[38:57] was intensive care on life
[39:01] support and I told him last night as
[39:04] honest as I could tell you if that had
[39:06] been me I probably wouldn't have
[39:09] come and I'd say it right
[39:12] here 99% that leaves Ryan and Gabby out
[39:15] 98% that leaves them out I'd say 98% of
[39:19] the people in this building would not
[39:20] have done what they done if you don't
[39:23] like that forget
[39:25] it
[39:27] I give them honor and
[39:29] Glory because they believe God spoke to
[39:33] them well if you believe God spoke to
[39:34] you where you ought to go to church
[39:36] where he spoke to you
[39:43] from
[39:45] okay look what he says off the message
[39:47] God's provided Place
[39:50] 1965 all right you can say well this is
[39:53] back in the old days there look what he
[39:56] he says that's the way it is
[39:59] today people want to hold on to their
[40:03] Petty
[40:04] ideas they want to hold on to their
[40:08] Creeds they want to hold on to it then
[40:11] talking about a Revival in our
[40:15] day how can we have a Revival when it's
[40:18] all messed up the way it is watered
[40:22] gasoline and everything else all kind of
[40:25] detergents and all these modernistic
[40:27] thing so what's he
[40:34] saying like I said most people are not
[40:36] looking for Revival so you might as well
[40:37] just cut the tape off and forget it till
[40:39] the service is afternoon that's fine you
[40:41] know but if you got any thought in your
[40:44] mind of thinking about a Revival to the
[40:51] elect something going on now in the
[40:54] elect to get ready to walk out of here
[40:58] that's it and if you're not thinking
[41:00] that way
[41:03] then you're not elect so it's okay all
[41:07] right look what he says about a in a
[41:09] deceived Church by the
[41:14] world while Samson was
[41:18] bound and we can't have a Revival listen
[41:21] to our loyal brother Billy grah Revival
[41:23] in our day listen to our to all listen
[41:26] at Old Robert screaming Revival in our
[41:28] day listen at the rest of them Revival
[41:30] in our
[41:31] day how can we have a
[41:34] Revival when we're
[41:38] bound no brother I'm
[41:41] loosed we've bound the holy spirit with
[41:44] our organizations and
[41:47] traditions and we can't have a holy
[41:50] ghost Revival we're not in the
[41:53] organizations bless God I've got out of
[41:55] there a long time I'm
[41:57] ago like brother Mo used to say he said
[41:59] you got your coat and hat and moved
[42:01] houses you know what he meant same old
[42:03] coat and hat hanging on the corner of
[42:05] the next hat a house you
[42:07] know you didn't do no good you just got
[42:09] your coat and hat and
[42:12] left see church I'm serious because this
[42:15] is life and death to me
[42:21] right but what are you waiting on I want
[42:25] somebody to tell me
[42:26] give me some hope
[42:30] yeah I don't have no hope but what I
[42:37] read I have no problem with listening to
[42:40] your ideas of what you think is going to
[42:41] take
[42:42] place as long as it's in the
[42:47] word but why is it everybody who comes
[42:50] along some young man come up got a
[42:51] little move a little spiritual go about
[42:53] everybody runs to
[42:55] him
[42:59] I don't one they die down they come back
[43:01] waiting on another young guy to come
[43:03] along oh we really got it this
[43:08] time
[43:10] okay but we don't have
[43:13] no organizations brother
[43:19] Dale we don't we don't have no
[43:24] Traditions he said that we we bound the
[43:26] holy spirit with our organization and
[43:29] traditions he said we can't have a holy
[43:32] ghost
[43:33] Revival now if the Holy Ghost is bound
[43:36] How can there be a Revival when I always
[43:39] understood it was the Holy Ghost that
[43:40] brought the Revival the Holy Ghost would
[43:42] get on somebody's heart and they'd rub
[43:44] the seats and praying for everybody in
[43:45] there in a Revival strike that's my
[43:48] understanding is if I missed that I'm
[43:51] sorry look what he says on the next one
[43:55] I think it's a deceived Church paragraph
[43:59] 79 so Revival in our day how can we have
[44:03] it when the regular Revival Giver is
[44:06] bound by the
[44:12] world now how can you have
[44:15] it God won't come in where the world
[44:25] is
[44:28] you can just depend on that he said you
[44:31] associate with the world then it it it's
[44:33] all of it when you let the world creep
[44:37] in you go to acting like the
[44:40] world then you're
[44:42] finished but when you cut loose ever
[44:44] fatter from the world and come to God
[44:47] God will use you until you go to
[44:50] flirting
[44:51] again you know that a lot of you don't
[44:53] believe in going to Fellowship means you
[44:55] think that's
[44:56] whirly but were with you
[44:59] yesterday in
[45:02] Walmart or a ball game or sitting
[45:05] watching
[45:07] One or deer
[45:10] hunting
[45:12] okay but you think it's worldly to
[45:15] associate with people that don't agree
[45:17] with you but you let them call you to
[45:20] come and preach and you'll be the first
[45:21] one there you'll open the door for them
[45:24] I've said that and I won't back
[45:29] up but you see that's where we think
[45:32] that out there is keeping us from having
[45:33] a
[45:34] Revival
[45:36] uh-uh as a matter of fact brother Brown
[45:39] said that's going to put the pressure on
[45:41] you and you know what he said he said
[45:44] the church always done better under
[45:45] persecution so you know what they're
[45:47] going to be our help
[45:49] yeah right Y what you see
[45:54] Church
[45:56] you go to flirting
[46:01] again here's the only hope that I have
[46:04] this morning to wind up my message is
[46:08] this while Samson was
[46:11] bound a new Shak of her grow
[46:15] out see that's our only hope in Lula
[46:20] Georgia amen is that God has given us a
[46:24] Time
[46:27] what do you think we've been around here
[46:28] 40 something years since the prophet's
[46:30] gone who do you think that was
[46:33] Far irregardless if you want to believe
[46:35] brother rand's coming back and preaching
[46:38] you've still been sitting waiting on
[46:39] something to
[46:43] happen
[46:45] right the rest of the people making fun
[46:47] of the people that believe it that
[46:50] way well I don't believe in that old
[46:52] junk about that I I don't believe in
[46:53] that old return Ministry what are you
[46:56] doing well just don't see nothing going
[46:58] on but we we'll go to church today if it
[47:01] don't
[47:06] rain Grandma don't feel good I'll
[47:10] probably go down by her afternoon and
[47:12] visit her at the nursing
[47:17] home
[47:19] afternoon okay that means you could come
[47:21] in the morning uh
[47:24] okay
[47:27] the only hope you and I
[47:32] have is that God has given us
[47:35] time that a little lock of hairs grow
[47:38] back on Samson's
[47:41] head that the bride has come to
[47:44] reality of thinking hey something's got
[47:48] to take
[47:49] place cuz if it don't you and I are
[47:51] dying and going by the
[47:54] grave that
[47:58] amen look what he says on the Feast of
[48:00] the
[48:03] trumpets that's 1964
[48:08] 719 he's talking about you know the
[48:10] ridings of the white horse rider I mean
[48:12] the four Riders and the things coming
[48:14] through like in the
[48:16] seal there is another group being made
[48:18] ready after a while Revelations 19 the
[48:21] next time the church is heard she comes
[48:23] also and up on exactly horses not excuse
[48:26] me not upon exactly horses the Bible
[48:29] said he was on a white horse and the
[48:31] host of heaven was following him upon
[48:33] white horses that's right while this
[48:35] group down here has got 2,000 years
[48:38] bound what's now bound at the river
[48:43] Euphrates and that's them Spirits
[48:45] remember and you remember what happened
[48:48] in those Spirits y those Spirits were
[48:50] bound and loosed on ikan and Hitler and
[48:53] them to drive the Jews to the the
[48:55] Homeland in the 30s the 40s and threw
[48:58] that away all right I say still driving
[49:01] them to the Homeland but that's just the
[49:03] point but he said to be loose 20 years
[49:06] later upon the
[49:08] bride well if you want to go to 48 then
[49:12] somewhere in 88 it got loosed again
[49:14] whatever you want to start it should
[49:16] have at least started something now
[49:18] loosed upon the bride to drive her to
[49:21] the
[49:24] Homeland
[49:28] right
[49:31] okay look what he
[49:33] says and has Bound for 2,000 years also
[49:36] that church is bound the Holy Ghost for
[49:39] nearly 2,000
[49:42] years under modum back there and under
[49:46] the church ages it's been bound not at
[49:50] the river Euphrates but at the door of
[49:53] Creeds and dogmas at the the Holy Spirit
[49:56] can't work in the church because of
[49:57] man-made
[49:59] systems now if you'll take that from 60
[50:04] 4 and 2,000 years would put you back
[50:07] past even the day of
[50:12] Pentecost because remember as quick as
[50:15] the Holy Ghost was loosed on the day of
[50:17] Pentecost the Antichrist was Loos also
[50:21] right
[50:22] amen right so the holy ghost has never
[50:26] been able to work in the church freely
[50:29] like he wants to why because people
[50:32] started taking their own
[50:35] ideas what about people in the days of
[50:37] Paul saying the resurrection has done
[50:42] P that's what they talk you know where
[50:45] they got that from
[50:47] Paul misinterpreted what he said because
[50:50] he talking about the resurrection to be
[50:53] an out
[50:54] Resurrection
[50:57] and the resurrection of the new birth
[50:58] was inside of us right amen and they put
[51:01] it to a physical thing right but look
[51:04] what he goes to say see this is one the
[51:07] things I love most people read this and
[51:09] they get all the home drums and they're
[51:11] down in down and out oh persecution
[51:14] persecution don't bother me
[51:16] whatsoever no I don't want to be killed
[51:18] I don't want this to happen or that to
[51:20] happen but I know one thing for sure if
[51:23] it's true that the church does better
[51:25] under persecution bring on the
[51:34] persecution look but she's going to be
[51:39] liberated she's coming back that's what
[51:42] the Bible said amen not talking about
[51:45] what a man said talking about what we
[51:48] say it's what the Bible
[51:50] said and those two meet again meet one
[51:53] another on the Battleground
[51:56] Lucifer and Michael again like the
[51:57] beginning they've been bound to for
[51:59] 2,000 years almost almost 2,000
[52:03] years Michael and Lucifer will fight
[52:07] when the Jews come into
[52:09] being
[52:12] right but why can't you see what's going
[52:14] on
[52:15] now Michael is Christ and I thought
[52:19] Christ was here fighting a battle
[52:22] now I would like for you to read to for
[52:27] and show me where brother Brandon
[52:29] brought any army down from any
[52:32] country together around
[52:40] Jerusalem come on you've been taught all
[52:43] your life all these armies are coming
[52:44] from India China Russia and all this
[52:47] gather around and it will take place but
[52:51] I'd like for you to read to foreal and
[52:53] show me where the Prophet says that you
[52:57] know what he says is coming he said
[52:59] Protestants and
[53:02] Catholics because what is Russia China
[53:04] India Protestants and
[53:09] Catholics well those countries over
[53:11] don't even have they've got the same
[53:14] carnal mind that come out of the garden
[53:17] which is organization or
[53:22] Catholicism my brother Ram never talked
[53:24] about firing guns and big old things you
[53:27] know tanks
[53:30] running he talked about a battle that if
[53:34] you'll read it you can see they were in
[53:36] that battle the greatest battle ever
[53:39] fought is right here in your human
[53:46] brain but we want to look at the all we
[53:49] want brother Dale brother gave me a book
[53:51] one time I want you to put down
[53:53] everything brother Brown said on 77 I
[53:55] never wrote down the
[53:59] time cuz he didn't care what was going
[54:01] to do this out or the other all he one
[54:03] was all the
[54:06] quotes well tell me brother Dale is
[54:08] Russia coming down this way is China
[54:10] coming this way is it coming down way
[54:12] why don't you just get a map and
[54:14] look the Bible says when Jerusalem has
[54:16] come passed about on all
[54:18] sides and you know what we own one side
[54:23] probably 3/4 of it is in cirle by us are
[54:26] our
[54:27] buddies right satellite
[54:33] countries cuz where is the Antichrist
[54:35] supposed to come from
[54:41] here
[54:47] right he says she's to be
[54:50] loosed look what he says on canor there
[54:54] paor Locus k now
[54:57] 1959 paragraph
[55:00] 113 you put a rag around a sh line you
[55:03] know you try to close off try to strain
[55:06] out all the
[55:08] bugs and that's what's the reason today
[55:11] we can't have Revival in our day it's
[55:14] too much man-made Dogma the lifeline
[55:18] won't won't wash through an
[55:21] old g r a g that rag I guess he's saying
[55:26] it'll stap the life will drop right back
[55:30] down to the ground that's the reason our
[55:33] revivals
[55:38] fail our revivals failed because that
[55:42] we're not getting the lifeline
[55:43] straightened out now what's he talking
[55:46] about there the lifeline water coming
[55:50] out of a
[55:51] cyan and you put a rag around it to
[55:54] filter out all of the bugs and you just
[55:57] get more bugs cuz we used to we filtered
[56:00] the bugs out
[56:02] right and we thought we were safe
[56:05] drinking the
[56:06] water we pushed it back and you
[56:14] know kind of remind me on movie I saw
[56:17] one time about an old old drunk when he
[56:20] comes up on a liquor steel where they
[56:22] got the mice going and it's kind of
[56:23] working and he didn't uh he didn't get
[56:27] him something straining he just moved
[56:29] the dead bugs the snakes the frogs the
[56:32] the the possums and everything back and
[56:34] he
[56:37] just he didn't give a hoot about a
[56:41] bug see we thought we filtered the bugs
[56:43] then we found out there was more than
[56:45] just those little there were minor
[56:48] organisms you know every what it was and
[56:51] kill
[56:52] us well I don't see how they died cuz we
[56:55] we filter that
[56:57] water
[56:58] yeah you filtered some peanuts down in
[57:01] Georgia not too long though
[57:05] right look at the next
[57:10] one this is from the third
[57:13] seal and now if the
[57:16] church churches would forget their
[57:20] Creeds and forget their
[57:23] dogmas and just take the Bible plead the
[57:29] promise that would become effective to
[57:32] him you want a Revival you've got to
[57:35] want
[57:39] it you've got to want it you got to
[57:42] First find out it's for you right right
[57:46] all right he said God will bring it did
[57:49] we read
[57:51] that the Holy Ghost may have been bound
[57:54] but you know if you read that whole
[57:56] message you'll find
[58:01] out that the Holy Ghost is be loosed
[58:04] according to Malachi
[58:08] 4 the Holy Ghost is to be loosed
[58:11] according to the prophet's
[58:18] message but how many of us are
[58:20] interested enough to read and listen to
[58:24] T
[58:25] do
[58:28] things what about
[58:35] it you say well he said the Revival's
[58:39] over he did back in 55 56 isn't going
[58:42] through there but look what he says in
[58:44] 1955 on a hidden life in Christ go ahead
[58:47] it's number
[58:50] eight R it up for
[58:53] you
[58:55] Brethren the same holy ghost that fell
[58:57] on the day of Pentecost that brought
[58:59] them results in will bring the same
[59:00] results to every believer tonight that's
[59:02] willing to concentrate their life to
[59:04] enter into the holiest of holies by the
[59:06] blood of the Lord
[59:09] Jesus the Same Holy
[59:13] Ghost but you go out to people like I
[59:16] told you I said in Colorado years ago
[59:19] and two brothers was talking about and
[59:21] they said well we don't understand how
[59:22] come brother Brown said the holy same
[59:23] Holy Ghost that fell on the day of
[59:25] Pentecost was in the
[59:27] people and I tried to explain that to
[59:29] them and they just blowed me one went
[59:31] this way and one went that way you know
[59:33] they didn't even
[59:37] listen cuz you see they already had it
[59:39] figured out one of them thought it
[59:42] hadn't come yet the other one thought
[59:44] you already had
[59:47] it that's that was what they were
[59:50] doing see you can't talk to people about
[59:52] a Revival why because it's all
[59:56] over and if it does come brother so and
[59:59] so will tell us when it's
[1:00:04] coming
[1:00:07] right man came to brother Mo's house one
[1:00:10] day and brother Mo mentioned something
[1:00:11] that he and I had been preaching on and
[1:00:13] the brother looked at him said where'd
[1:00:15] y'all get that
[1:00:19] from and brother Mo said it's what the
[1:00:22] prophet taught he said no where'd y'all
[1:00:25] get it from said it just come out up in
[1:00:27] North Carolina up here under a few weeks
[1:00:31] ago I said it came out a lot of years
[1:00:36] ago in a prophet's message y'all are
[1:00:39] just now getting catching on to
[1:00:42] it of course I had one brother call me
[1:00:44] he said I want to come down and preach
[1:00:45] this new thing that's going on up here I
[1:00:47] said I don't heard about it don't want
[1:00:48] it boy he didn't like
[1:00:50] that I told him don't hurt it don't want
[1:00:54] it
[1:00:56] yeah but
[1:00:59] listen if we'll do that if ever believer
[1:01:02] not just willing to consecrate their
[1:01:04] life to enter into the holiest of holies
[1:01:07] by the blood of the Lord Jesus not a
[1:01:09] hard thing to do you know
[1:01:12] what look what he said it'll do he said
[1:01:15] it'll break down Traditions it'll change
[1:01:18] men's Hearts it'll melt you into one
[1:01:20] person in Christ Jesus s an old F and S
[1:01:24] Revival across this country he said
[1:01:27] that's what it would
[1:01:30] do
[1:01:33] right well where's the people going to
[1:01:35] do
[1:01:36] this what we need today we need an
[1:01:39] oldfashioned God sent Heaven bought Holy
[1:01:42] Ghost
[1:01:43] brought Revival not just a little bitty
[1:01:47] shaking up or a little emotional worker
[1:01:49] but an oldfashioned dying out self-c
[1:01:52] concentrating Hallelujah backwood SK
[1:01:54] skin sky blue sin killing religion amen
[1:01:59] it won't white wash you it'll wash you
[1:02:01] white the devil will white wash
[1:02:03] everything that he can but God washes
[1:02:06] white and that's what we need today is
[1:02:08] an oldfashioned God sent Revival that'll
[1:02:11] just break down the hearts of the people
[1:02:14] and bring all of these denominations
[1:02:17] into one great big unified group of the
[1:02:20] glory of
[1:02:21] God now we know that's not going to
[1:02:27] happen but let me get down to just a
[1:02:29] little
[1:02:30] Point
[1:02:32] here that brother Rand made a statement
[1:02:34] one
[1:02:35] time I forgot to bring
[1:02:39] it he said when a move becomes among the
[1:02:43] bright a sweep he calls
[1:02:47] it he said them
[1:02:49] denominations will gather
[1:02:53] together boy bless God one of these days
[1:02:56] them denominations going to gather
[1:02:57] together and when they do we're going
[1:02:59] out of here that wouldn't what the
[1:03:00] prophet said he said when the move
[1:03:03] becomes among the bride the
[1:03:05] denominations will come together you
[1:03:08] want them to come together get a good
[1:03:11] old handshake and happiness around
[1:03:14] here when some of you ain't shook hands
[1:03:16] with the people around here in six
[1:03:23] months
[1:03:25] right right I ain't talking about just
[1:03:30] one okay I'm talking about the biggest
[1:03:33] portion of
[1:03:38] you
[1:03:44] right what about
[1:03:47] it let's get down to Lula for just a
[1:03:51] minute go ahead with number nine let's
[1:03:53] get this one
[1:03:55] couple of little quotes we'll
[1:03:58] quit look what he says on
[1:04:01] adoption there is where the church is
[1:04:03] failing today on that walk do you know
[1:04:06] that even your own behavior can knock
[1:04:09] somebody else out of getting
[1:04:13] healed watch what he says it is your
[1:04:17] misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You
[1:04:23] believers
[1:04:24] the unbeliever is not going to stop
[1:04:27] anything he'll try to hinder it but it's
[1:04:30] Believers that you got the problems
[1:04:33] with
[1:04:35] right can cause this church to bitterly
[1:04:38] fail but here's where people doing it
[1:04:40] and at the day of judgment you'll be
[1:04:43] responsible for every bit of
[1:04:49] it bless God I'm straight I'm right you
[1:04:54] said' wait a minute brother well that's
[1:04:57] the
[1:04:59] truth Lula
[1:05:01] Georgia
[1:05:03] what do you realize if he's right there
[1:05:06] that unconfessed sins is a
[1:05:13] problem
[1:05:17] now a lot of you know a whole lot more
[1:05:19] what's going on in this church than I do
[1:05:22] because you like to run your mouth and
[1:05:24] you like to listen to what everybody
[1:05:25] else says instead of saying don't talk
[1:05:28] to me talk to your
[1:05:31] pastor now you ain't going to say that
[1:05:34] cuz you got that gossip and spirit on
[1:05:37] you get upset with
[1:05:40] me too old to play games that's
[1:05:46] right but you see the reason I don't
[1:05:48] know what's going on here is because I
[1:05:51] don't go around oh what's going on
[1:05:53] what's going what's going on what's
[1:05:55] going on yeah yeah brother dick going
[1:05:57] eat we in the morning don't find out
[1:05:59] what's going on then the next morning
[1:06:00] brother Mark and next day brother and
[1:06:07] next I'd rather sit down in the
[1:06:13] woods I'd rather sit down in the woods
[1:06:16] on a deer
[1:06:19] stand and pray for
[1:06:23] you
[1:06:25] not thank God say God show me what's
[1:06:29] wrong
[1:06:31] hey he don't have to show me what's
[1:06:33] wrong I'm looking at
[1:06:35] it
[1:06:37] right he don't have to show me who's
[1:06:39] doing
[1:06:42] what because you know what now find out
[1:06:45] you're doing it I'll pray for
[1:06:52] you I'll pray for are
[1:06:56] you well you're a funny fell I'd go
[1:06:58] right straight to that person or them
[1:07:00] people or them
[1:07:04] no when that happens and I'll call you
[1:07:08] in my
[1:07:09] office remember one statement I make you
[1:07:12] come in my office whether it be him or
[1:07:16] him or her my kids or my wife and you're
[1:07:19] called in my
[1:07:22] office you don't have nothing to
[1:07:28] say what do you mean brother Dale when I
[1:07:31] call you in there you don't have nothing
[1:07:34] to say I'm going to tell
[1:07:37] you yeah but you don't understand my
[1:07:40] case not expl I'll say shut up I told
[1:07:42] you when you come in here you don't have
[1:07:44] nothing to say you say no that's not
[1:07:46] right you told me that ain't right if I
[1:07:48] cry and pray for you and lay before God
[1:07:51] and and cry and pray and he he does
[1:07:54] speak to me he ain't waiting to dilly
[1:07:57] dally with
[1:08:02] anybody do you
[1:08:06] understand but you see our problem is
[1:08:14] what said one
[1:08:17] person now all all it takes is one
[1:08:21] thing I would like for you to explain
[1:08:24] now we got Wade
[1:08:26] Dean
[1:08:28] Aaron where's Bob and
[1:08:32] Lise now I want the camera to turn
[1:08:35] around on me when I sit
[1:08:39] down is there any way to do
[1:08:41] it I may have to get a little further
[1:08:45] back but what if I sit down and you're
[1:08:49] preaching and I
[1:08:52] go h
[1:09:00] or
[1:09:12] either do you know that one
[1:09:16] person can walk in this
[1:09:18] building with the wrong
[1:09:21] attitude and affect everybody in this
[1:09:24] building that's
[1:09:29] right you don't think like
[1:09:34] that why is it that we're supposed to
[1:09:37] pray and things before services and you
[1:09:40] come in here with a bad
[1:09:45] attitude well brother D what that got to
[1:09:47] do with Revival Revival's got to start
[1:09:51] here what's in the other churches out
[1:09:53] there
[1:09:54] we can't
[1:09:56] control revival can only start here when
[1:09:59] we come in here with one attitude one
[1:10:02] mind and one Accord
[1:10:07] amen you realize brothers sisters
[1:10:10] anything we grip about a
[1:10:16] baby
[1:10:17] right I move up front where I don't hear
[1:10:20] them babies crying my hinder my spirit
[1:10:22] that baby crying don't hear to me as
[1:10:24] much as you sitting there with a lock
[1:10:26] down
[1:10:27] attitude I'd like for you preachers to
[1:10:30] answer that one thing to me right that's
[1:10:32] right that if I sat there with my arms
[1:10:34] folded Y and didn't say Amen when the
[1:10:37] service is over you'd want to talk to me
[1:10:40] and want to know what I differed with
[1:10:41] you
[1:10:43] about
[1:10:46] am right
[1:10:49] amen I walk outside and don't shake your
[1:10:52] hand
[1:10:56] why why didn't he shake my hand he
[1:10:58] walked right by
[1:11:03] me are you kidding
[1:11:07] it what's hindering Lula is
[1:11:13] Lula do you realize you come in here
[1:11:17] with a lock down attitude and you will
[1:11:19] control every person is sitting around
[1:11:21] you amen
[1:11:24] you ever notice
[1:11:29] me I'm always saying
[1:11:37] amen sometimes I've amened what I didn't
[1:11:39] think was right when it was finished but
[1:11:41] when it started the amen was
[1:11:45] right I've got accused of that a few
[1:11:47] times I said you didn't hear the first
[1:11:48] part first part was
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] you see a child crying did brother
[1:11:56] brandom say a child running through the
[1:12:00] church between
[1:12:03] Services would hinder the next service
[1:12:06] to
[1:12:08] come no brother Dale I don't think God's
[1:12:11] that way then you don't believe brother
[1:12:12] Brown's a prophet
[1:12:16] okay cuz that's what he
[1:12:20] said you come in here with a sarus
[1:12:23] attitude sat down
[1:12:26] grappy then the people around you are
[1:12:29] going to have that
[1:12:33] attitude and all you got to do like I
[1:12:36] said all I got to do sit on the front
[1:12:38] row and you preaching and I
[1:12:45] go everybody the building what's wrong
[1:12:49] with brother
[1:12:51] Dale he didn't agree with that
[1:12:59] you see Church we're not getting
[1:13:03] by he said at the day of judgment you'll
[1:13:07] answer for that amen I'm not going to
[1:13:10] judgment bless God well then you're
[1:13:13] going to have to repent to this
[1:13:17] church do you understand you're going to
[1:13:21] have to come up here and bent to this
[1:13:24] church for your actions and reactions
[1:13:27] are you're going to be held accountable
[1:13:30] for
[1:13:34] them
[1:13:35] no is that right
[1:13:40] am I mean all you got to do is one
[1:13:44] thing and people around you know there's
[1:13:47] something
[1:13:49] wrong and they don't have to know
[1:13:51] there's something wrong but reason Reon
[1:13:53] is most people's got that same
[1:13:56] Spirit a lot of you sit next to each
[1:13:58] other because you like the spirit you
[1:13:59] sit next
[1:14:06] to I watch you move when things
[1:14:11] starts and how many times have I told
[1:14:14] you if you got a problem you're supposed
[1:14:17] to come to
[1:14:21] me but Brother D I don't I don't I don't
[1:14:24] start
[1:14:25] nothing but if somebody comes and says
[1:14:28] something to you you're supposed to say
[1:14:31] let's go to the
[1:14:34] pastor are shut
[1:14:37] up of course you're not going to do
[1:14:41] it but you're going to answer at
[1:14:44] judgment
[1:14:47] amen well brother Dale I've seen you bad
[1:14:49] attitudes and I'm always saying to me
[1:14:52] you forgive me
[1:14:53] you ain't never heard me say this I'd
[1:14:56] like to play you some tape
[1:14:58] sometimes you ain't never heard me say I
[1:15:01] forgive
[1:15:05] you cuz I know what's happening right
[1:15:10] then and I say I forgive
[1:15:20] you because I believe if I didn't say it
[1:15:24] other problems would take
[1:15:30] place see we're not playing games
[1:15:34] church this is not just going to church
[1:15:37] and being good paying her tithe
[1:15:40] and somebody's going to walk off this
[1:15:43] Earth and these old bodies going to be
[1:15:51] changed what but you know it's only when
[1:15:55] the bride has a
[1:15:58] Revival and you tell me you're not going
[1:16:00] to have a Revival and I tell you you're
[1:16:03] not going for you ain't going to be in
[1:16:05] the chain of the
[1:16:07] body I said it 30 something years ago
[1:16:10] the biggest portion of the people would
[1:16:11] die and go by the grave because they
[1:16:13] would not be able to do that I've said
[1:16:15] that to you for all of those years
[1:16:18] that's
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:29] but let's don't get a pitch for it and
[1:16:31] start throwing it back

[1:20:56] Prophet said that and the scripture says
[1:20:58] it all right you realize that that
[1:21:00] judgment you're going to stand there and
[1:21:01] answer for every little little
[1:21:04] attitudes and all them times you listen

[1:21:58] feelings you can stir them a little make
[1:22:02] them think but you can't hurt their
[1:22:03] feelings so if you got your feelings
[1:22:05] hurts you're just not right is that
[1:22:08] enough that plain
[1:22:14] enough let's
[1:22:18] stand but just remember my
[1:22:21] statement
[1:22:24] if you sin before come on M this if you
[1:22:26] sin before the church you come before
[1:22:28] the church to answer
[1:22:32] that and why wouldn't you want right I
[1:22:36] don't understand
[1:22:40] that I've been
[1:22:43] under two Pastors in this
[1:22:46] message I'm thinking that's right if I
[1:22:49] may count more but brother Mike was one
[1:22:51] and brother MO
[1:22:54] and while I was assistant to them and I
[1:22:56] wasn't a pastor or ministering of it
[1:22:59] brother mik I was a
[1:23:02] deacon but people would come out and ask
[1:23:04] me
[1:23:05] questions about the
[1:23:07] message and I would refuse to answer
[1:23:13] them because their Pastor was supposed
[1:23:16] to answer that
[1:23:18] question one day he was standing there
[1:23:21] and he said go ahead and answer I said I
[1:23:23] will
[1:23:26] then brother Mo was Pastor here for five
[1:23:30] or six
[1:23:32] years I can lay it on the line here
[1:23:35] before God and say I never done one
[1:23:38] thing against
[1:23:39] him to try to hinder him I always wanted
[1:23:43] to help
[1:23:45] him I wanted to back him
[1:23:49] up well because I believed he was trying
[1:23:51] to bring the truth
[1:23:58] you never heard me say even with a
[1:24:00] couple of brothers that we had problems
[1:24:02] with over the
[1:24:03] years I still made nothing derogatory
[1:24:06] about them because I loved
[1:24:12] them Brother D I just I just can't be
[1:24:15] that way well maybe you need to
[1:24:17] pray that's all I got to say what we got
