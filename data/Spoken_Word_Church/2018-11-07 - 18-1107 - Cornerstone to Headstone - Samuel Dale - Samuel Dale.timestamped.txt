[1:24] everybody in the house of the Lord if
[1:26] you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[1:27] turn to Zechariah 4 then we'll try to
[1:34] pick up the thought from where we were
[1:38] the last time we spoke and just kind of
[1:41] continue on in the thought pattern and
[1:44] just remember all the announcements now
[1:47] to pray for one another pray for Donnie
[1:50] in Wade and myself as we're going to
[1:52] hunt for a few days that everything will
[1:54] work out from there and pray the Lord
[1:55] would bless us and this you brother Bob
[2:00] will be ministering this coming weekend
[2:02] the morning and the evening service or

[2:31] problems so keep them in your prayers
[2:33] that the Lord would bless each one all
[2:35] right any other announcements we didn't

[2:43] your grace and your love and your
[2:45] understanding thank you
[2:47] Lord that you would guide each one of us
[2:51] into the right way to follow after you
[2:54] because surely it is not within the
[2:57] human mind or thoughts for us to be able

[3:17] are sick among us and just come down and
[3:20] do what you said because you said you
[3:22] sent your word and healed us and
[3:25] delivered us from destruction so we
[3:27] believe you and we thank you as we read
[3:29] your words you come now among us and
[3:32] Lord most of all forgive our sins and
[3:35] make us to be clean in your side we love
[3:38] you and we thank you
[3:40] in Jesus name Amen Zachariah for we read
[3:46] this the other day but listen there's
[3:48] something I miss quoted it in a little
[3:50] bit so I'll correct that as we go
[3:52] through into the thought but let's
[3:55] reread the scripture and start with that
[3:58] Zachariah 4 and the angel that talked
[4:02] with me came again and waked me as a man
[4:06] that is wakened out of his sleep and he
[4:09] said unto me what's this doubt and I
[4:13] said I have looked and behold a
[4:15] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[4:18] the top of it and his seven lamps their
[4:20] own and seven pipes to the seven lamps
[4:23] which are upon the top thereof and two
[4:26] olive trees by it one on the right side
[4:29] of the bowl and and the other up on the
[4:33] left side thereof so I answered and
[4:36] spake unto the angel that talked with me
[4:38] saying what are these my lord not like I
[4:40] said the other day he's shown these
[4:42] things why would he be thinking you know
[4:46] about it and say well Lord what are
[4:49] these because he's a prophet and he
[4:52] knows something is going to come forth
[4:55] our God is dealing with him you know to
[4:58] bring out something so he
[5:00] then the angel that talked with me
[5:02] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[5:05] not what these be and I said Lord no my
[5:08] lord
[5:09] the answered and spake unto me saying
[5:11] now he tells me what this exactly is
[5:14] this is the word of the Lord under unto
[5:18] Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[5:21] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[5:25] hosts who aren't the old great mountain
[5:28] before is rule that shall become a plane
[5:31] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[5:34] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[5:36] grace unto it moreover the word of the
[5:39] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[5:42] the rouble have laid the foundation of
[5:44] this house now he's getting back to a
[5:48] house getting up to doing the buildings
[5:50] knowing what's going on right the hands
[5:54] of aruba will have laid the foundation
[5:55] of this house and his hands shall also
[5:57] finish it and I shall know that the Lord
[6:01] of Hosts has sent me unto you for who
[6:05] hath despised the day of small things
[6:07] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[6:10] plummet in the hand of the ruble with
[6:12] those seven there are the eyes of the
[6:14] Lord which run to and fro through the
[6:17] whole earth okay you may be seated the
[6:19] Lord had his blessing to the reading of
[6:21] the word now I want to kind of speak
[6:28] tonight if I can on to get our thoughts
[6:32] in a line of something that as I was
[6:35] doing with we're reading in Scripture
[6:38] and it says you know he showed him these
[6:41] things and any asking said what are
[6:44] these things well why didn't he answer
[6:46] him back well it's the lampstand as to
[6:50] this as to that it's why didn't he
[6:55] answer him back that away because see
[6:58] that's not the way God deals God deals
[7:01] with his prophets in a special way to
[7:04] show him the scriptures and times and so
[7:08] he those and asked him again and what
[7:09] are these and he said now this is the
[7:12] word of the Lord
[7:14] that came unto his ruble all right now
[7:18] we know the whole story are the story
[7:21] part of Zerubbabel you go back in this
[7:24] is the restoration of the temple alright
[7:27] coming back in to manifestation wait I
[7:30] remember your a few years ago spoke on
[7:33] this line and went through it and I
[7:35] remember back dark in Ezra you'll find
[7:39] where it was starting and the the King
[7:42] Cyrus made a decree now that King was a
[7:45] hearing King he wouldn't a Christian he
[7:48] wouldn't you know a believer you know
[7:52] but God laid on his heart and what about
[7:55] a king now that they had defeated a
[7:57] country totally wiped it out kind of
[7:59] sounds like America in a way because you
[8:02] know we got that because we went over
[8:03] and destroyed Japan and in Germany and
[8:06] everything then went back and rebuild it
[8:07] you know so get that thought into your
[8:10] mind what the king was to do it the King
[8:12] says now I'm just gonna build a temple
[8:15] you go that and you take everything you
[8:17] need I'll supply you the money the gold
[8:22] everything and you go build this temple
[8:24] for your people know that don't you
[8:27] think I kind of believe that fellers
[8:29] gonna be in glory don't you I kind of
[8:31] believe God's gonna honor that man's
[8:35] dedicated nough Stu try to get a people
[8:38] to sit back to that place and he tells
[8:42] as Ray said now if you need anything
[8:44] just tell him to take it out of my bank
[8:49] account in other words he gives you the
[8:51] right to use all of the thing and he
[8:53] said I'll give you all of the gold the
[8:59] instruments the things and it lists it
[9:01] through Azra and going on through you
[9:03] know and so on how that there to to
[9:07] build a temple and when they got the
[9:09] temple built everything was to be put
[9:11] back in the temple that Nebuchadnezzar
[9:13] had taken out and cured down to Babylon
[9:16] and he's giving him everything now what
[9:17] a wonderful wonderful thought of it that
[9:21] you could just stop there and see how
[9:23] much that God he is to the basis that
[9:27] when he start
[9:28] dealing with a man's heart a man goes
[9:31] back there to to Abraham you know and
[9:34] and when he demanded was gonna fix to
[9:37] Mary Abraham's wife and everything you
[9:39] know when God says now you do that and
[9:41] your dad he says no Lord you know now
[9:45] you know that integrity of my heart Lord
[9:47] you know I didn't know anything about
[9:50] this and the Lord we know straighten it
[9:53] all up because that was what he was
[9:54] gonna do but the point is God can deal
[9:56] with heathen people and do things you
[10:00] know and take care of it and all like
[10:03] that well we shouldn't worry about our
[10:05] things
[10:06] you know I mean when they when when Ezra
[10:10] come in and that King told him said okay
[10:12] you know he called him in to him said I
[10:14] won't talk to you know and he calls him
[10:16] and he says I want you to do something
[10:18] for me and Ezra says well what do you
[10:21] want you know we're at your command
[10:24] we're your slaves we're you know here he
[10:28] said now you're not gonna be a slave
[10:29] anymore
[10:31] and there's a prophecy well what do you
[10:34] mean he said cuz I'm gonna set you to a
[10:36] position since you're going back over
[10:40] there and you're gonna rebuild that
[10:41] temple and said you're gonna do all
[10:44] these things and he says well Oh King
[10:46] why
[10:47] he said because it's just from my heart
[10:51] this from my heart I want to do it well
[10:55] if he can take an old king when I try to
[10:56] make it do it how much more should he do
[10:58] with each one of us all right now that's
[11:01] the point I want you to think about I
[11:03] want the children to think about it like
[11:05] this because it's kind of been in my
[11:07] mind that we talk about headstone
[11:10] cornerstone you know this or that or the
[11:13] other and we we talk about candlesticks
[11:17] and and a lot of you know what we're
[11:19] talking about but a lot don't because
[11:22] they've never been taught
[11:25] maybe what this is and what that is just
[11:28] remember one thing when you're reading
[11:31] these things they're that it is God
[11:35] working out his plan of salvation you
[11:39] know
[11:39] and what a wonderful God that he is to
[11:43] think of us to set aside all of these
[11:47] things for us and we could just rejoice
[11:51] in it you know and think about it and
[11:55] when we talk about Cornerstone headstone
[11:59] we'll see it's not a stone no more than
[12:02] what a red door that he says now what
[12:05] are these things you know he's showing
[12:07] him plan left stands he showed him
[12:09] candlesticks he showed him all kind of
[12:12] you know the two olive trees and the
[12:14] thing and he said well what are all of
[12:17] these things and he said this is the
[12:21] word of the Lord how about summing up
[12:24] all of the wonderful things that had
[12:27] been spoken there in Zechariah with that
[12:30] statement that this is the word of the
[12:32] Lord that has come to Zerubbabel all
[12:37] right now
[12:38] Zuba belen the natural was like a
[12:41] governor etc some kind of a high-ranking
[12:45] official with with Israel you know more
[12:47] than just a normal little person but he
[12:51] had a job to do and and he took all of
[12:56] these things and started doing it and
[12:58] all of that speaks of us when you read
[13:02] that Old Testament and you see a wheel
[13:04] in the middle of the wheel of of maybe
[13:06] Ezekiel you know and you'll see this
[13:09] happening and and you'll see that
[13:11] happening remember children that it's
[13:13] God expressing to us his plan of
[13:18] salvation when it comes down it's not
[13:20] treason and lapsed hands and those are
[13:24] just the things that are put there to
[13:29] help us and give us understanding it's
[13:31] really talking about you and me it's
[13:34] bringing us to the plan of salvation of
[13:36] God to us as you know as his people all
[13:40] right
[13:41] so children keep that in mind and in
[13:43] when we say Cornerstone remember the
[13:45] Bible says that Jesus Christ is the
[13:48] chief Cornerstone he we're built on the
[13:50] foundation of apostles and prophets
[13:51] there in Ephesians
[13:53] Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone
[13:54] well now then it's not a cornerstone
[13:57] like a building or this that's that's
[14:00] just natural things that's natural parts
[14:04] that are made and done to show us
[14:08] spiritual things the the cornerstone of
[14:12] a building is the part of a building
[14:15] where you put your anchor or start it
[14:17] forth we'll see our whole anchor is in
[14:19] Jesus Christ and that's what it's
[14:21] talking about cornerstone see that it's
[14:24] in Jesus Christ being revealed because
[14:26] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[14:28] you and me all right and then when we
[14:32] say headstone it's just simply more of
[14:36] what was revealed about Jesus Christ to
[14:42] us see it moves from a corner to a head
[14:47] and since it's like in the building we
[14:50] talked about in the pyramids or whatever
[14:52] then the cornerstone would be the
[14:54] cornerstone of it the headstone it's the
[14:57] same stone it's just a way of expressing
[14:59] it it's still revealing that much more
[15:02] because the whole church is built upon
[15:05] the revelation of Jesus Christ so - -
[15:09] just think about it when you say
[15:10] cornerstone headstone you say that's
[15:12] talking about Jesus Christ that's you
[15:15] know that's revealing Christ - you and I
[15:18] and bringing it out to where we can
[15:20] follow it and understand it and you know
[15:23] and it's not just say well words we hear
[15:26] this and we hear that but do do we
[15:28] really know see the entire Bible is the
[15:30] revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:33] alright see then whatever you're reading
[15:36] in that way so you can read the Book of
[15:39] Revelations and you can read those
[15:42] things and and see what caught me was we
[15:45] read the Bible we read the book but we
[15:47] didn't have the understanding part and
[15:50] when I first started reading the things
[15:53] the Prophet would say the Book of
[15:55] Revelations was that was wonderful that
[15:57] was you know was upgrading enlightening
[16:00] helping us to understand but one day he
[16:04] said it like this
[16:06] he said that's the acts of a play that
[16:12] the Book of Revelations is the acts of a
[16:14] play I thought hey that breaks it down
[16:20] then is you know in an acts of a play
[16:23] you got to have actors to act out a play
[16:28] and run around said one day we're on the
[16:31] life page you know you remember that
[16:34] we're on the live page well there's some
[16:36] things could take place I'll hit it one
[16:38] day we talked of a couple of two or
[16:40] three brothers of it the other night a
[16:41] little bit and we'll get down into it
[16:44] one of these days and speak a little bit
[16:46] about some of those things but it's not
[16:48] just our horse riding a black horse or
[16:52] red horse or pale horse me that's what
[16:56] God is looking down and seeing mankind
[16:59] as they look like to him you know and
[17:03] it's not like a King Kong beast running
[17:05] across you know my brother-in-law's a
[17:09] Baptist preacher that's that's what he
[17:10] thinks it is
[17:11] I said well ain't much deceiving in that
[17:13] you know I mean he ain't going to see
[17:17] nobody were very big the east us it's
[17:20] got to be something deceiving you know
[17:22] well see that's just symbolic orthology
[17:25] so the whole Bible is that away see when
[17:30] we say Jesus was the cornerstone well we
[17:34] don't mean he was just put in somewhere
[17:35] and made in a building part it's a
[17:38] revelation of Almighty God that was
[17:42] revealed to mankind through Jesus Christ
[17:45] standing on the earth right all right C
[17:48] then the headstone would just be more
[17:50] revelation or the complete revelation or
[17:54] the finish or whatever you want to bring
[17:56] it to perfection
[17:58] and it would it helps us then to
[18:00] understand these things see we can go
[18:03] from here in Zachariah to the Book of
[18:07] Revelations and and look in it and and
[18:11] see how that you know the things fit
[18:16] together but remember and that's what I
[18:18] was doing
[18:18] I got a point I figured somebody catch
[18:21] me and say hey wait a minute you said
[18:23] that wrong
[18:24] well I'll straight up long thing in a
[18:25] minute but you know see to show you the
[18:28] difference or the way we go a lot of
[18:30] times in our thinking and God does it it
[18:33] mentions a lampstand in Zechariah it
[18:39] mentions - in relation me because it
[18:43] just opens up to more understanding all
[18:46] right
[18:47] and see we look at those things and
[18:49] sometimes we get confused but just
[18:51] simply read backwards or forth around it
[18:53] you know and it's all a revelation of
[18:56] Jesus Christ when you're reading the
[18:59] Bible read that Bible as God speaking to
[19:02] you he's talking to you he's revealing
[19:09] himself to you he is the word and all of
[19:13] it's a word we'll get to it in a minute
[19:15] where the Prophet is talking about the
[19:17] Word of God and what it is to all of us
[19:22] it's God speaking to us and see we read
[19:26] it as like we read like the Ten
[19:28] Commandments and we'll get to that in a
[19:31] minute and mention it but we read it
[19:33] like that's a buckaroos well it's a
[19:36] revelation of the person of Jesus Christ
[19:40] well I just don't see how that can be
[19:42] cause you're reading wrong I used to
[19:45] mentor brother Gary Atkins he he'd
[19:47] always you know he had a way of coming
[19:51] up with things you know and he'd say now
[19:54] he said we read the Ten Commandments
[19:56] like this nor shalt not kill thou shalt
[20:02] not steal you know meaning and error
[20:06] good and hateful and said that's the way
[20:09] we think it say it but said if you read
[20:11] it a little different and read it
[20:12] thou shalt not kill that's not my steal
[20:17] it comes forth in a different
[20:19] understanding right do you get it it
[20:22] makes a different understanding of
[20:24] things it becomes from a hateful
[20:25] arrogant God that we think is saying
[20:28] thou shalt not kill although I'll kill
[20:31] you for killing them
[20:32] see instead of it being that away it
[20:35] turns out to be love revealed that's the
[20:39] whole word that that's been on my mind
[20:41] to say that part to her you know because
[20:45] I realize that we just a lot of times we
[20:47] we just run over things and we we say
[20:50] things and we don't clarify it enough to
[20:53] let the children know what's going on I
[20:56] thank God for the Sunday School classes
[20:59] where they can be exposed to these
[21:02] things and and talk about Jesus Christ
[21:05] in their lives and their ways and their
[21:09] doings because that's what it's all
[21:11] about it's about the revelation of Jesus
[21:14] Christ okay
[21:15] all right now so we've read the
[21:18] scripture from Zechariah all right and
[21:22] in reading that scripture we we did and
[21:28] I was actually mind running about two
[21:32] miles ahead of mouth and you know I
[21:37] thought maybe some of you would pick up
[21:39] the thought and come back to me to say
[21:41] and say well brother Dale you said that
[21:43] was that wouldn't write said because we
[21:46] know that verse seven I see is that
[21:51] right let me get it back this is the
[21:57] word of the Lord under the rubble saying
[21:59] not by might nor power by that spirit
[22:01] saith the Lord who are at our old great
[22:03] mountain before is ruined I shall become
[22:06] a plane and he shall bring forth the
[22:08] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[22:11] grace unto it now this is arou beable is
[22:18] going to bring forth the headstone all
[22:21] right now it's a ruble not is not God
[22:26] he's the prophet but that's an example
[22:30] now keep zerubabbel in mind as an
[22:34] example of the last day prophet alright
[22:38] and what took place in our day and has
[22:41] taken place and you're going to see a
[22:44] little something here that
[22:46] random save something that sounds a
[22:48] little bit funny it's like if he's not a
[22:52] he doesn't say the word exactly right
[22:55] but he does when you bring it down to
[22:59] you and me when you bring it down to her
[23:02] that this is arou verbal represents the
[23:05] end time messenger the seven churches
[23:09] messenger will read it in a second and
[23:11] showing that all right so we read here
[23:14] it says that he'll what he'll bring
[23:16] forth the headstone all right so then
[23:20] he's gonna have something to do with the
[23:21] headstone coming all right more verse 8
[23:24] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[23:25] me saying the hands of Jubilees the
[23:29] foundation of this house his hands also
[23:32] shall finish it yeah he's gonna lay the
[23:36] foundation okay are they the whole thing
[23:41] because that's what he done you get the
[23:44] story from Ezra them so ruble is the
[23:47] first one mentioned in in Ezra and he is
[23:51] the chief and he goes and they a bunch
[23:54] of them goes with him he goes down and
[23:56] he starts doing the works and things if
[23:59] you'd get that message of way back about
[24:01] what three four years ago something like
[24:04] that and and it shows the the point to
[24:08] each one you know of do it but what I
[24:10] said was see now the scripture says here
[24:14] in verse seven verse six excuse me makes
[24:20] you giddy right we're going somebody on
[24:22] Titan to go back and listen to it verse
[24:24] seven says that this is aruba bull okay
[24:29] he shall bring forth the headstone daro
[24:32] shouting grace grace unto it now I like
[24:36] that because I like what brother Brennan
[24:39] said one day he said my whole makeup is
[24:43] great and see the hips don't ain't gonna
[24:47] come for counting rules and regulations
[24:53] it ain't gonna be cutting ironed dress
[24:56] and clothes and stuff you know
[24:59] because that ain't even the cornerstone
[25:02] we're gonna get to that in a minute see
[25:05] that ain't it's not even the cornerstone
[25:07] but random didn't have to come to try to
[25:09] tell the women how to dress your had
[25:11] enough sense to know how to die if
[25:13] you're born again Christian if you're a
[25:17] born again Christian York nota had to
[25:20] been told how to dress well it was the
[25:23] custom of the day when I didn't think
[25:31] Christianity fit into the custom of the
[25:33] day all right
[25:35] but now when the way brother Branham
[25:37] says this and I'm gonna read what he
[25:38] says so that you get to point of the
[25:41] reason I'm saying that I brought her I
[25:43] said he would not he would wrinkle it's
[25:45] the cornerstone but he wouldn't bring
[25:47] the headstone all right that was a slip
[25:49] of the tongue that was back on October
[25:51] the 28th that I made a slip of the
[25:54] tongue I go back and listen to my own
[25:56] messages two and three and four times
[25:57] sometimes because I want to make sure
[25:59] that my wording is right because I'll be
[26:02] responsible for that all right and I
[26:05] noticed it on there that I said that he
[26:09] would not bring the headstone well the
[26:12] Bible says he will all right well now
[26:15] I've got a quote from brother Branham
[26:17] says that he didn't bring the
[26:19] cornerstone but the Bible says he did
[26:22] now what we're gonna do we're gonna have
[26:29] to see something he's talking about
[26:32] because we don't we're confused
[26:34] all right so we'll just read what he
[26:37] said cuz see verse verse seven said he
[26:42] shall bring forth the headstone thereof
[26:45] with shoutings green grace grace verse
[26:47] nine in the hands of drew will have laid
[26:49] the foundation of this house
[26:54] so remember some things that took place
[27:00] did Giroux beable relay the cornerstone
[27:03] I'm gonna say this before I read the
[27:05] quote from the Prophet did he
[27:08] necessarily relay the cornerstone
[27:13] because David Wright Solomon Solomon was
[27:21] the one credited with starting the
[27:23] building right and see Solomon built the
[27:27] temple all right they tore it down but
[27:31] did Solomon come back you know I mean
[27:33] there's this zhirova we'll come back to
[27:36] the land and say okay the temple was up
[27:40] yonder but I think he'd be better down
[27:44] here now do you get that Giroux bull
[27:50] wasn't that way he was a prophet he was
[27:53] hunting exactly were to put the
[27:57] foundation and I believe the foundation
[28:01] was exactly layed on exactly the same
[28:04] place and not one inch out of
[28:07] measurement from the original by Solomon
[28:11] that's just my point he see because of
[28:16] something that brother George Smith said
[28:18] to me when we was in Israel and Reuben
[28:21] the God you know was kind of a talking
[28:25] and something and then he had come up
[28:27] and brother George spoke to me later
[28:28] about it and he said you know that those
[28:31] Jews are dependent upon Elijah to show
[28:36] them were to build the temple you see
[28:43] then I've checked it with Reuben you
[28:47] know and with my own understanding and
[28:48] listening brother branham and everything
[28:50] see because that building can't be
[28:55] something different it's got to be
[28:57] exactly right
[28:59] and see they're looking for Elijah if
[29:02] you understand the Old Testament people
[29:05] they are looking
[29:07] for Elijah to proceed Moses in your two
[29:11] witnesses see they think Elijah is going
[29:16] to come before Moses and Elijah would be
[29:19] able to tell him exactly were to put
[29:22] that temple and Reuben said to me one
[29:25] day and he said Sam he pointed to a
[29:28] brick and lament in the wall or blocks
[29:31] that had been laid into the wall you
[29:33] know and covered up a door he says there
[29:35] is no thoughts about where to put the
[29:39] temple he said it's right behind our
[29:45] they begin to understand that things are
[29:49] getting into the right order but they're
[29:52] waiting on the lives you to tell them me
[29:55] about this where to put it
[29:57] all right think about that now now let's
[30:00] read and then I'll show you worth it I
[30:02] made the mistake and I'm going to
[30:04] correct my own mistake so then that way
[30:06] you know it won't be a problem it may
[30:10] not mean a thing to you but it means a
[30:11] lot to me so I go ahead number number
[30:13] two brothers and let's pick it up this
[30:16] is from the message of grace preached in
[30:19] 61 827 all right we're all acquainted
[30:24] with the scripture that reads the Bible
[30:26] we know that this was during the time of
[30:29] the preparation of the restoration of
[30:31] the temple and zerubabbel was a great
[30:35] prince among the people now watching who
[30:38] laid the foundation of the building now
[30:44] keep it in your mind but around City
[30:47] laid the foundation now listen to it and
[30:51] now you I want you to put on your
[30:53] spiritual thinking or northing jacket
[30:57] this morning as we think this Great
[31:00] Prince had determined to rebuild a house
[31:04] of God and then when he did he had laid
[31:07] the foundation stone how much it and as
[31:12] we read on father we find out that God
[31:15] said the robe will has laid the
[31:17] foundation with his hands he also show
[31:21] bring forth the headstone I want you to
[31:25] notice what's him he never said he shall
[31:31] bring forth the cornerstone he said
[31:37] he'll bring forth the headstone now you
[31:44] got him up twice above there that he
[31:47] lays the foundation you got the
[31:51] scriptures that he laid the foundation
[31:54] hmm
[31:55] why would a prophet say now run that
[32:02] back down where we make sure and keep up
[32:04] with it the other way oh don't wait for
[32:07] y'all and as we read further on Giroud
[32:11] will laid the foundation with his hand
[32:13] but he also shall bring forth the
[32:15] headstone I want you to notice he never
[32:17] said he shall bring forth the
[32:19] cornerstone he shall bring forth the
[32:25] headstone see that quote was in my mind
[32:27] and I crossed it between headstone
[32:29] corners that's all I've done and when
[32:31] you listen to the tape you probably
[32:33] won't pay that much attention to it but
[32:35] it is technical to me because the Bible
[32:38] said he laid he would bring forth the
[32:42] headstone but the Prophet said it didn't
[32:47] say he never said he shall bring forth
[32:49] the cornerstone now what's he saying
[32:56] he's the Prophet what is this point okay
[33:02] so let's keep reading and we know that
[33:08] the scripture said that Jesus was the
[33:11] chief Cornerstone and he's also that's
[33:14] time now if we'll take a few minutes
[33:17] that the 7th church messenger was to
[33:20] restore the faith of the children back
[33:23] to the father's and watch him in other
[33:27] words rebuild the temple the church
[33:29] again under the power of the Spirit not
[33:32] much power I might
[33:34] but by my spirit saith the Lord not by
[33:37] organization not by denomination by the
[33:39] Holy Spirit will bring forth the church
[33:41] in the last days and I watch him the
[33:44] ruble the Prince with Joshua now that's
[33:50] the difference Joshua from from your
[33:53] Joshua of Moses and Joshua okay this is
[33:56] on onover okay but it is he's the name
[34:00] is dark but there's a different one sure
[34:02] over the prince was Joshua was the one
[34:05] that was to bring forth this headstone
[34:07] and what's he he had laid the foundation
[34:12] he took the people back to the
[34:14] foundation in top they took him back in
[34:21] top all right so now get what I'm
[34:25] talking about
[34:26] see Jesus Christ laid the cornerstone he
[34:32] is the cornerstone were built Ephesians
[34:36] were built on the foundation apostles
[34:38] and prophets Jesus Christ being the
[34:40] chief Cornerstone all right he was that
[34:44] stone he's also the head stone but why
[34:49] would the prophets say now he didn't say
[34:53] to bring forth the cornerstone one of
[34:56] the cornerstone didn't have to be
[34:57] brought back you remember I emphasized
[35:00] over and over and over to you now listen
[35:03] I emphasize over and over that in the
[35:06] church ages no church age was left
[35:08] without the new birth so no matter how
[35:12] much the bug ate away and even brother
[35:16] Brown said he elite to life but remember
[35:18] you can't take away the new birth you
[35:24] remember that I am beside it over and
[35:26] over you can't take away the new birth
[35:28] each church age had the new birth all
[35:33] right what was eight away was what the
[35:35] bug ate of the faith of the fathers what
[35:41] Peter named had brought forth and they'd
[35:43] brought forth through got four ages that
[35:45] they held with that stature of a perfect
[35:47] man
[35:48] and I were Colombian with her doctor
[35:50] they held to that truth of the God until
[35:53] the field church age and then it died
[35:55] and went in the ground
[35:56] why do you see what the prophets talking
[35:59] about see he takes them back to the
[36:04] foundation and taught the rubra bull
[36:08] didn't as I said didn't have to go over
[36:10] there he had to hunt the place but once
[36:15] he found the place he knew the corner if
[36:20] he had to build in to lay it out in you
[36:22] were exactly where he's at so he could
[36:24] build that temple he could do as the
[36:27] scripture says then he would lay the
[36:30] foundation he lays the foundation all
[36:34] right
[36:35] but then he takes it back to that
[36:37] foundation and that's what brought
[36:39] around I'm done little random come to
[36:42] bring us the faith of the fathers he
[36:45] didn't have to relay the cornerstone he
[36:51] just took us back to the cornerstone he
[36:56] took us back to the word zerubabbel when
[37:03] once he got there he probably spent days
[37:07] search him
[37:10] you know some of them probably said okay
[37:12] hey we're running short on time then
[37:15] guys will probably come over here and
[37:16] take away our our good property thing we
[37:19] better get at it
[37:20] we'll just start right here he said no
[37:26] just leave me alone for a little bit
[37:30] because God had already spoke to me back
[37:33] here a prophet knows where the
[37:38] cornerstone is at the Prophet knows
[37:41] where the foundation is that a prophet
[37:44] knows how to build a building the
[37:46] Prophet company was all built under the
[37:48] prophet Moses but it was laid out in
[37:53] curtains and stuff like that with Moses
[37:56] there were no concrete foundation but
[38:00] when Solomon
[38:02] come forth and just remember Solomon was
[38:10] the one that rebuilt a temple but
[38:12] remember David was Dhara are you with me
[38:20] David was there for quite a while
[38:24] David got everything ready
[38:27] he laid everything out Oh Joshua had all
[38:31] Solomon had to do was just start putting
[38:34] it together
[38:35] right now are you listening
[38:39] he listened the point of what I'm saying
[38:41] see my thoughts was in that line and
[38:43] that's why I made the statement because
[38:45] I knew there was a statement that the
[38:49] Prophet had made about it and he says it
[38:52] in the message there he never said he
[38:56] shall bring forth the cornerstone he
[39:01] didn't say that he said in other words
[39:04] he's going back to the foundation he
[39:07] relayed the foundation for what was
[39:09] needed and the temple was built upon
[39:13] that foundation
[39:14] I believe that foundation was to the tea
[39:17] and to the inch because they didn't play
[39:20] around over them things when you can
[39:24] build a pyramid in Egypt that has no
[39:26] shadows night or day whatever you know
[39:29] and it's all to the my new fraction and
[39:33] that pyramid in Egypt is built upon your
[39:37] your what is it what does it call power
[39:40] Squier your somebody say that word or
[39:44] what it is I didn't get it see PI R
[39:51] square is one point one form so cilantro
[39:54] it's it's the German measurement metrics
[39:57] metrics is involved when you get down to
[40:01] where the pyramid was built yeah and
[40:04] that's why it comes forth with your
[40:06] measurements and it's to the T that it's
[40:09] sitting perfectly for the world all the
[40:11] way around my point is why don't you
[40:14] think David
[40:16] was led of God don't you think he said I
[40:23] can't do it
[40:25] what he said Solomon you get ready to do
[40:29] the work I'm gonna walk this thing off
[40:34] for you and you put that cornerstone
[40:39] right here now don't move it an inch
[40:45] put that cornerstone it's all of them
[40:48] right here
[40:50] don't you think Solomon followed his
[40:52] order you understand what I'm getting at
[40:55] the perfection that God has that he
[40:58] brought through the Prophet the Prophet
[41:02] knew exactly were to put the temple so
[41:06] did is removal when he went back he knew
[41:12] exactly where to put that foundation but
[41:17] notice the Prophet said 'no said he
[41:19] never said he shall bring forth the
[41:22] cornerstone why because the cornerstone
[41:24] is Jesus Christ you don't have to relay
[41:28] that that's a natural temple that they
[41:31] had to relay had to do everything this
[41:33] is a spiritual temple this is a temple
[41:37] that was built on the day of Pentecost
[41:40] in the upper room when the Holy Ghost
[41:43] fell and as it did then it brought
[41:46] mankind down through and we're built
[41:49] upon not a building to threaten some
[41:51] work that's just the accuracy of
[41:54] Almighty God
[41:56] we're built upon the foundation of the
[41:59] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being
[42:01] the cornerstone and wasn't it one of
[42:03] those apostles that jesus said who the
[42:09] man say I the Son of Man and whether the
[42:14] issue that you don't know you know and
[42:16] who do you say Peter said thou art the
[42:20] Christ the Son of the Living God and
[42:24] what did Jesus say back to him he said
[42:28] upon this rock
[42:29] I'll build my church that rock that
[42:32] stone has never been destroyed the
[42:36] cornerstone was never destroyed I'm
[42:39] talking about spiritual cornerstone I'm
[42:42] talking about in the Bride of Christ
[42:44] every age was built on the foundation of
[42:47] the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[42:49] being the chief Cornerstone and the
[42:52] build on the revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:54] every age is built upon that when Luther
[42:58] come out with that just shall live by
[42:59] faith that was a marvelous thing because
[43:04] it was a starting back to work that it
[43:07] would bring forth the truth so you
[43:11] follow me
[43:12] that's what brother Branham see by
[43:15] reading the scriptures he read the
[43:18] scriptures that we read he read the
[43:22] headstone will be brought forth by
[43:24] zerubabbel he read that the foundation
[43:27] would be laid by saruba bull right he
[43:32] knew that but then when it fence poses
[43:35] over into our day or into the new
[43:37] testament he said he took him back in
[43:42] top well because they laid everything
[43:48] back ik perfectly the way it was when
[43:52] that temple was brought forth over there
[43:54] it was put exactly where it was supposed
[43:56] to be to the my new each you know
[44:01] because God was directing his prophet
[44:05] and what's more can we depend upon this
[44:07] these things that this prophet has
[44:10] brought a statue of a perfect man
[44:11] adoption you know who who is God and
[44:15] what is this and you know the redemptive
[44:19] plan brought by this man but just
[44:23] remember that when brother Branham cuz
[44:25] this is the point I'm trying to get you
[44:27] to see why the Prophet said that he says
[44:32] now it doesn't say he shall bring forth
[44:35] the cornerstone because he brother
[44:37] Branham never had to bring the
[44:39] cornerstone he had to replace it
[44:44] it's kind of like a brother said at my
[44:46] house one day and I knew his doctrine
[44:48] and he was sitting there trying to
[44:51] explain some things too and I said yeah
[44:53] I know y'all say that you swept off the
[44:55] foundation so that was their doctor they
[45:00] said brother Branham laid the foundation
[45:02] but they had to sweep it off and clean
[45:05] it up straighten it up some of you may
[45:07] remember him and they had to lay the
[45:11] foundation themselves and build the
[45:14] building I said well the hard part about
[45:18] it is you say you going out beyond the
[45:21] profit yeah cuz that's what we've done
[45:24] we went beyond we we swept off all we
[45:27] had to sweep out what the problem said
[45:29] cause he laid a lot of it wrong in other
[45:31] words that a little we flip it off okay
[45:36] and said we're gonna build a building I
[45:38] said well they ain't but one problem
[45:40] with that he said what is that I said
[45:44] well brother branham you say you go
[45:45] beyond brother branham yeah I said
[45:48] brother branham priestess in a future
[45:49] home don't know if you're gonna tell me
[45:53] anything started - future home boy he
[45:57] shut up
[45:57] cuz he knew he was proud he couldn't
[45:59] move nowhere go where would you go
[46:02] you can't go no farther than the future
[46:04] home that was the prophets message they
[46:09] couldn't say they was gonna tell her
[46:10] something I said tell us past a future
[46:12] home oh he was smart anything he said oh
[46:15] you the future here is a tell us about
[46:17] the seals I said I'll tell you nothing
[46:19] about anything time I said code I ain't
[46:24] worried about it I just know for certain
[46:26] you ain't got nothing cuz you can't put
[46:29] it in the message in other words you
[46:32] can't tell me something run around them
[46:34] didn't I say to make me better or to
[46:39] change my body or whatsoever because you
[46:42] went to the future home you understand
[46:45] what I'm getting at
[46:46] why would the Prophet say I want you to
[46:49] notice he never said he shall bring
[46:51] forth the cornerstone
[46:55] tell brother branham never brought forth
[46:57] the cornerstone the disciples brought
[47:00] the cornerstone that was the foundation
[47:04] of Jesus Christ built upon the apostles
[47:06] and what they told there's your whole
[47:09] foundation it's what they told see Jesus
[47:17] is that cornerstone he didn't out to be
[47:19] relate all he had to do is just bring
[47:25] them back if the Prophet said he brought
[47:27] him back to it in time
[47:29] what does he mean by top he brought him
[47:33] back to it in what it was supposed to be
[47:37] all right so then the prophets right see
[47:42] because he says now zerubabbel the
[47:45] prince with Joshua was the one that was
[47:48] to bring forth the headstone he had laid
[47:52] the foundation watch him he took the
[47:58] people back to the foundation in top and
[48:03] when you're getting a type of something
[48:06] now somebody help me with the scriptures
[48:08] maybe but you should know what but
[48:11] anyhow when Elijah was over there and he
[48:15] built that altar you remember the next
[48:17] challenge him and he built the altar he
[48:19] got everything fixed and he built the
[48:22] altar and he said okay now you cry you
[48:28] cry out to your garden let's see they
[48:31] cried out all day long finally he said
[48:33] this yet and said by the way go help me
[48:37] said pour some water all in this little
[48:42] track that's around here and said just
[48:45] run it all over and said just pour it
[48:48] over the offering pour it over the wood
[48:54] right you remember that in the screws
[48:57] yeah I had a while he said now Lord let
[49:02] the people know now somebody catch that
[49:04] scripture and said let the people know
[49:08] what then he turned her heart back
[49:14] missing the Old Testament that's when it
[49:16] said there about Elijah he said let the
[49:18] people know Lord that you turned her
[49:22] heart back what in time in time they
[49:28] returned to God to walk with him with
[49:31] Elijah see of a type of the end time to
[49:35] were that we walk in the message of the
[49:37] hour we don't need somebody to sweep off
[49:42] and do this and do that and don't worry
[49:45] about it
[49:48] see because in the Old Testament you had
[49:53] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph right the
[49:56] foundational stone right and then who
[50:02] built the body who who built that
[50:04] building the prophets the prophets built
[50:10] the body John being the life's one come
[50:15] to introduce the head am i right am I in
[50:18] the scripture that's the way your
[50:22] prophet describes it all right you can
[50:26] see Elijah said let it be known you got
[50:30] it
[50:31] first Kings 1837 then let it be known
[50:38] that their heart I believe that singular
[50:40] in it their heart is turned back because
[50:45] it comes down to one heart instead let
[50:48] it be known they stood back there in top
[50:52] of you and me because here's where we're
[50:56] coming back to the original that's why
[50:59] it took bread around them so long to
[51:03] come and do it
[51:05] so there's your your scripture did I am
[51:08] the servant and that I have done all
[51:09] these things that I word hear me O Lord
[51:14] hear me that this people may know that
[51:17] thou art the Lord God and that thou has
[51:20] turned there
[51:21] heart back again then the fire fail you
[51:27] want the fire to fall let's just get
[51:29] back to the profit and the way he said
[51:33] it because he said things that I said
[51:35] sometimes he said things that sounds odd
[51:39] why would the man read the scripture it
[51:44] was a ruble and knowing in that
[51:46] scripture that zerubabbel was to bring
[51:49] forth the headstone but knowing also
[51:52] that he was to bring forth the
[51:55] foundation then the Prophet turns and
[52:02] says what he never said he shall bring
[52:08] forth the cornerstone you can do all you
[52:14] won't do and think how you want to the
[52:17] revelation of Jesus Christ is what the
[52:20] bride is built on that's what we've got
[52:23] to be built on what those apostles
[52:25] taught there is your foundation and
[52:30] there is your corner which Jesus being
[52:32] the chief Cornerstone there he was right
[52:35] in what they say and there is your
[52:37] cornerstone the cornerstone is supposed
[52:41] to have within it all the things that's
[52:46] made within the building is all set out
[52:50] and described in your cornerstone
[52:52] because that's where it's all got it
[52:55] tied to you see what brother Branham he
[53:00] never had to relay that he didn't go get
[53:03] something new he went right back when he
[53:06] started out he went right back to the
[53:09] apostles and prophets and said dyers the
[53:11] cornerstone there's the foundation and
[53:18] said now what we need to do is just
[53:19] build the building and see he could see
[53:23] that even the church ages the emember
[53:26] statue of a perfect man brother Brennan
[53:28] said this shows that the individual
[53:30] comes forth and he said as the
[53:32] individual come forth he said to church
[53:33] come forth the same way
[53:35] so of the Old Testament Abraham Isaac
[53:40] Jacob and Joseph was that foundation the
[53:44] prophets built the body and Jesus Christ
[53:46] stepped out upon their would John would
[53:49] it not be the same in the end time
[53:51] through the church ages the church
[53:56] started off when was doing great
[53:59] wonderful they were really building a
[54:03] good building within all at once about
[54:08] the fifth church age 13 Aires was called
[54:11] the Dark Ages of time Satan come forth
[54:14] and started tearing that building down
[54:18] right see it had never got to the place
[54:22] of the introducing of the headstone
[54:24] that's why the headstone was rejected in
[54:27] the church ages time you get to the
[54:31] fifth church age your headstone had
[54:32] totally been lost they didn't have any
[54:34] understanding of God they didn't have
[54:36] any understanding of the cornerstone
[54:38] because the cornerstone is the faith of
[54:40] the Father right so what was lost in the
[54:44] church ages 5 6 & 7 what was lost the
[54:48] stature of a perfect man the adoptions
[54:52] the things the Prophet had to come and
[54:54] preach to us to bring Jesus Christ back
[55:00] and see look what he had to do no wonder
[55:03] it took him 30 something years he had to
[55:05] literally go back to the foundation of
[55:08] the apostles and prophets start out from
[55:13] that and rebuild the church well I don't
[55:19] see it something wrong with you then cuz
[55:21] I you're part of it if you got the
[55:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I you're
[55:27] part of that building what are you
[55:29] looking for see then as John the Baptist
[55:33] come to introduce Jesus Christ he
[55:36] introduced him as the headstone but they
[55:38] rejected him so he had to become the
[55:40] cornerstone in the temple he had to come
[55:44] down to the cornerstone the Prophet came
[55:48] that had been eaten totally down until
[55:51] it was back down to that original but it
[55:56] wasn't either way that new birth and
[55:59] upon this rock humour what he told Peter
[56:03] remember this is son of man he said who
[56:06] the man say I the son of man I am
[56:08] I'm Peter raptured back the only thing
[56:10] he could answer what is Peter to
[56:12] answering the son of man is he couldn't
[56:15] answer it because he didn't have the
[56:16] revelation so what did he say he said
[56:20] thou art the Christ
[56:21] now come on church don't belittle Peter
[56:24] in what he said for heaven's sake don't
[56:26] belittle God I stood right here years
[56:29] ago and asked one question did buffaloed
[56:32] the people in this building and a lot of
[56:34] you still mad at me til this day because
[56:36] of the statement I made some people left
[56:40] in things because the statement was like
[56:42] what what was the statement I said what
[56:47] was the first form of Almighty God what
[56:53] was the first form
[56:54] well first one the Prophet said of
[56:56] Almighty God you want to call it lo
[57:03] God's theophanies I would just remember
[57:06] what he said it was he said the lo God's
[57:09] theophany was the son of God the Son of
[57:14] God is your first form of God because
[57:17] there's helo gosh you theophany is the
[57:20] son of God if you don't believe that
[57:21] I'll be glad to show you throughout the
[57:23] message read a little bit let you see
[57:29] what I'm talking about
[57:32] because we get our ideas and our
[57:34] thoughts we don't want to accept truth
[57:39] because that just flat went over some of
[57:41] your heading this now I didn't say that
[57:44] brother branham is the one that said it
[57:46] I'll be glad to show you these quote he
[57:48] said that the son of God was the first
[57:50] form God ever had because the Son of God
[57:55] is the creator and that's what Peter
[57:57] said look what Peter announced him
[58:02] the crust wrote around them didn't say
[58:06] if you don't see Jesus in every verse
[58:08] because he knows you can't find Jesus in
[58:11] every verse What did he say if you don't
[58:14] find the Christ in every verse he said
[58:16] go back and read it again cause you
[58:17] missed it dollar the Christ Peter said
[58:24] Peter looked at him literally and was
[58:26] saying you are the create car now What
[58:31] did he say
[58:31] okay you're recognizing me as a creator
[58:34] I'm going to show you that I am what did
[58:35] he turn back to Peter and say he said
[58:39] Peter upon this revelation of what you
[58:44] say it of Who I am I'm gonna build my
[58:47] church and the gates of hell can't
[58:50] prevail the church was built on the
[58:52] revelation of son of God that's why your
[58:57] denominations could never get it right
[58:59] they couldn't understand brother Branham
[59:00] when he would talk about low gosh
[59:02] theophany being son of God there were so
[59:04] much above all of that into their great
[59:06] understandings they couldn't listen to
[59:08] him but the first form of God was the
[59:11] son of God which was the low cost a
[59:14] theophany
[59:15] the word I'll be glad to show you these
[59:20] in the message anybody on the internet
[59:23] if you don't have the ability to run it
[59:24] just run in front of God what you see
[59:27] that's where people think then when you
[59:29] make a statement like that then it blows
[59:31] in their face because everybody was
[59:33] dealing it with it he was the son of man
[59:35] I said don't worry about son of man do
[59:37] you get Son of God straight right son
[59:44] God is the new birth Jesus plainly was
[59:48] saying like I said today and Wade made
[59:50] that statement - I make it and believe
[59:52] it Jesus said to Peter Peter you didn't
[59:58] answer my question
[59:59] because I asked you who was the son of
[1:00:02] man and you answered who was the son of
[1:00:07] God but he said I'll come back
[1:00:15] and I'll declare who the son of man is
[1:00:19] that's what's so amazing to me oh you
[1:00:24] you don't know what it does to my heart
[1:00:28] to think you think I'm just throwing
[1:00:31] stones or throwing this out the other
[1:00:33] you show me where Paul ever mentioned
[1:00:35] son of man you show me where Peter ever
[1:00:37] mention other than the Matthew Mark Luke
[1:00:39] and John they're in the scriptures and
[1:00:42] they were talking of son of man all
[1:00:43] right but show me in the any of their
[1:00:46] doctrines where they ever brought forth
[1:00:48] the son of man right but are you
[1:00:54] listening to what I said he said Peter
[1:00:56] go ahead I'll build my church on that
[1:00:59] rock that you're talking about so that's
[1:01:01] a revelation of who I am for now I'm the
[1:01:04] son of God the Christ the create car I
[1:01:07] said I'll come back one day that son of
[1:01:10] man 47 is the year we start recording
[1:01:19] the profit right 47 what did it faith is
[1:01:24] the substance first title you know and
[1:01:26] all I care they may have some more now
[1:01:27] but I'm just giving you that's what
[1:01:29] looking 48th and brought around started
[1:01:32] talking about son of man get noticed
[1:01:38] that brother Branham started talking
[1:01:42] about son of man let's see you're not
[1:01:48] listening you think it's sarcasm or
[1:01:50] arrogance or hateful of me to say it
[1:01:52] we Baptist knew son of man was the
[1:01:55] resurrection sign because Jesus said I
[1:01:59] am the resurrection and under Son of Man
[1:02:03] the Son of man is the resurrection
[1:02:09] brother branham picked it up because his
[1:02:11] message is the resurrection he had to do
[1:02:17] restorations and things yes back to the
[1:02:22] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:02:25] but then one day he declared his own
[1:02:27] message and opened those seals this son
[1:02:34] son of God is the revealer right son of
[1:02:40] man is the one who broke the seals not
[1:02:46] brother branham now don't go how you are
[1:02:48] with me they done that in 1969 when I
[1:02:51] taught it in the first message and I
[1:02:53] told it that the bride would be the son
[1:02:56] of man I still stand was out of that and
[1:02:58] I still got the quotes if you want to
[1:02:59] read them where your prophet said it the
[1:03:03] bride would be the fullness of the
[1:03:04] Godhead bodily in the last day and she
[1:03:07] would be the son of man the Word made
[1:03:10] flesh old people just looking at me the
[1:03:14] end of a pitiful I wouldn't quite as
[1:03:19] pitiful as I thought because that was 69
[1:03:23] and I still believe that man what the
[1:03:31] bride is the Word made flesh now when
[1:03:38] she climbs her statue a perfect man when
[1:03:40] she gets into the word that's where she
[1:03:42] comes out to be not to just say the
[1:03:46] bride is the son of man see that's
[1:03:47] you're throwing it wrong you're making
[1:03:49] me say something I didn't say I didn't
[1:03:52] say that
[1:03:53] it's just like I've taught you the new
[1:03:55] birth the new birth is not because you
[1:03:57] can quote the word the new birth is when
[1:04:02] the word is made alive to you by
[1:04:05] revelation because upon this rock I'll
[1:04:09] build my church there's a new birth the
[1:04:14] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:16] when these seals and things are revealed
[1:04:19] to the bride and she finds out who she
[1:04:22] is what did the Prophet say he said when
[1:04:25] the bride realized who she is and what
[1:04:28] she here for
[1:04:28] he said she'll be an invincible army
[1:04:37] what I just don't see it's doing any
[1:04:40] good
[1:04:44] what group would you fit in the Old
[1:04:46] Testament
[1:04:49] what group with that attitude would you
[1:04:52] fit in the Old Testament you couldn't
[1:04:56] say you were following the prophets
[1:04:57] because the prophets were building the
[1:04:59] body of Jesus Christ and John being the
[1:05:03] chief Cornerstone
[1:05:04] I mean being the the John coming as the
[1:05:07] the one to introduce the head which
[1:05:11] would be the chief Cornerstone as he has
[1:05:13] to come in the ages where would your
[1:05:16] doctor and fit with that see I
[1:05:19] understand all night long and talk about
[1:05:21] that Old Testament science and how they
[1:05:24] were bringing forth Jesus Christ who was
[1:05:27] the fourth man in the fire when that old
[1:05:32] king heathyr and King looked in there he
[1:05:34] said didn't we throw forward a three and
[1:05:36] nine I said yeah he said well a
[1:05:38] foreigner and says that one is likened
[1:05:43] to the son of God Viji Scripture in
[1:05:51] other words the old man had it's no
[1:05:53] sense to know for certain that if they
[1:05:56] throwed three in there that kill the
[1:05:57] others that throw them in and here's the
[1:06:00] fourth one that just jumped in there of
[1:06:01] his own accord or was already there or
[1:06:04] something and it never bothered him at
[1:06:06] all he'd have to know that he was God
[1:06:09] and if he could see him he couldn't call
[1:06:12] him God you don't get that he called him
[1:06:16] son of God you can't see son of God son
[1:06:24] of God it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:26] am i with the Prophet the Holy Ghost the
[1:06:33] Prophet said let me get this one the
[1:06:35] Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the
[1:06:39] word brother Branham could not reveal
[1:06:42] one thing to you and me
[1:06:46] but we ain't gonna get it without him so
[1:06:50] he had something to do with us getting
[1:06:51] it but he couldn't give it to us you
[1:06:56] remember the statement Wade likes to
[1:06:57] make when he gets over to the the
[1:07:00] questions and answers for that
[1:07:01] I believe his questions and answers on
[1:07:04] the seals
[1:07:05] he said that's gone from you tell me you
[1:07:08] were sitting there I didn't like the
[1:07:11] statement you get so upset when he
[1:07:12] called I read he said it's gone from you
[1:07:15] and says no way for you to get it but he
[1:07:21] finishes it up you listen to there's
[1:07:23] more right there at it he finishes it up
[1:07:25] but something's gonna take place it's
[1:07:30] gonna be revealed it's gonna be revealed
[1:07:38] but you see that's where we can't keep
[1:07:40] it straight we take the 10 commandments
[1:07:45] it's a book of rules when the Prophet
[1:07:49] said it was the revelation of God come
[1:07:58] on what are we gonna get out of our baby
[1:07:59] play pins and Rattlers and get on with
[1:08:01] listening a little he said - 10
[1:08:07] commandments What did he say I gave it
[1:08:09] to you the other day the unveiling of
[1:08:11] God they pull it up they went to number
[1:08:12] eight Moses priest and led them out of
[1:08:15] Egypt and died before the real
[1:08:19] commandments was laid down the seals was
[1:08:23] brought in God comes down before the
[1:08:26] people and prove that Moses was sent
[1:08:29] from the impact brother Allen could put
[1:08:34] the seals and the Ten Commandments
[1:08:36] together because either seals is not a
[1:08:39] book of rules all right do you want to
[1:08:41] stay for a little bit let's read let's
[1:08:43] see for you
[1:08:48] let me grab something right here in the
[1:08:50] back
[1:09:02] okay
[1:09:04] headstone will come forward crying grace
[1:09:06] grace amazing grace me now they can
[1:09:11] going over to number four if they want
[1:09:12] to because listen to what your prophet
[1:09:14] calls the Bible therefore it's not a
[1:09:17] book of man man didn't write the word
[1:09:28] somebody said it's just some old Hebrew
[1:09:30] rottens with the Hebrews write a letter
[1:09:33] that condemned themselves really it's
[1:09:36] not a book of man it's a book of God and
[1:09:39] the man who sees the vision or hears the
[1:09:42] voice of God never understood it many
[1:09:46] times themselves in many cases because
[1:09:52] the Word of God is truth there is no
[1:09:54] other truth there's no other truth can
[1:09:57] take its place it's all truth the word
[1:09:59] is God is God in letter form the Bible
[1:10:05] is not a book of systems I'm going over
[1:10:07] and just keep on going number seven it's
[1:10:10] not a book of systems nor a book nor a
[1:10:14] code of morals the Bible is not a not a
[1:10:22] book of systems so many systems and so
[1:10:25] forth no sir it's not a book of morals
[1:10:27] no sir it is not
[1:10:30] naari it's a book of history altogether
[1:10:32] I mean all together our neither is it a
[1:10:35] book of theology for us a revelation of
[1:10:37] Jesus Christ is the is the Commandments
[1:10:43] in the book is the seals in the book
[1:10:47] well it can't be a book of rules it
[1:10:51] can't be a book of morals you know what
[1:10:53] he means moral well we don't cut a
[1:10:56] higher we don't we don't painter
[1:10:58] Facebook oh we're great yeah
[1:11:07] were ordered Moses or not I don't know
[1:11:15] what you thought not Moses who it the
[1:11:17] guy that made a golden era word it Aaron
[1:11:20] get the gold to make the golden guy I'm
[1:11:28] laying out something that's gonna flop
[1:11:29] you where did he get the gold that we
[1:11:33] made them the earrings out of the women
[1:11:40] the women and men wore earrings oh no
[1:11:46] brother Dale
[1:11:47] that was in the Old Testament they
[1:11:49] didn't wire them earrings will read your
[1:11:53] Bible they took the earrings out and
[1:11:59] made the golden cave well we don't
[1:12:07] believe in wearing everything's do we
[1:12:09] why why is it wrong for us to wear
[1:12:16] earrings as they warm you hadn't never
[1:12:25] thought of that
[1:12:26] they wore earrings Leah and women why is
[1:12:32] it wrong for us go run over there and
[1:12:37] ask them people why it's wrong and
[1:12:39] they'll tell you it ain't wrong and
[1:12:41] they'll tell you that the reason I
[1:12:43] believe it ain't wrong for everybody
[1:12:45] cause they're men and women know that
[1:12:46] were worried about you can't argue they
[1:12:50] did all because of that little word
[1:12:57] brother branham used well ago where he
[1:13:01] said he took them back to the foundation
[1:13:03] in top took them back to the foundation
[1:13:12] in top right
[1:13:16] showing that the top was what you know I
[1:13:19] need to reap resit the top was the fact
[1:13:21] that God that brother branham never had
[1:13:24] to come and lay the cornerstone it was
[1:13:27] dire that was Jesus Christ when he
[1:13:29] walked out there he was speaking of a
[1:13:32] God that was real that's what called me
[1:13:34] oh man
[1:13:35] I've listened to all the preachers talk
[1:13:38] about God I had heard them all in their
[1:13:40] doings and talking and how God was so
[1:13:42] great to him and all of the things and I
[1:13:44] had seen God do things as a Baptist I'd
[1:13:47] seen God move and do things I wanted to
[1:13:51] find the God of the Bible I talked to
[1:13:57] those old Baptist preachers the one that
[1:13:59] was there when we left I asked him did
[1:14:02] he know William Brennan I had heard of
[1:14:03] him he said I've heard of him and said I
[1:14:06] won't say nothing because I see that old
[1:14:09] Baptist preacher would preach take the
[1:14:12] saddle I've heard him preach it my wife
[1:14:13] convert the kids floated too young but
[1:14:16] he preached take the saddle off with
[1:14:18] them of the horse and put it under the
[1:14:20] church if he's gonna pray for rain he
[1:14:23] was a good old Baptist that believed in
[1:14:25] the healings and signs and wonders long
[1:14:32] church but do we think that this message
[1:14:37] is a book of rules
[1:14:38] I used to quote it until it was a sister
[1:14:42] here she laughed at me about it
[1:14:44] is your wife worthy of the gospel you
[1:14:47] know there is a direct quote in that
[1:14:50] message is your life worthy the gospel
[1:14:52] that literally says your wife were the
[1:14:54] gospel that sister she lives she said
[1:14:59] brother Dale I've never heard anybody
[1:15:00] talk about is your wife worth in the
[1:15:02] gospel I said that's all everybody
[1:15:05] thinks they can get the women and
[1:15:07] straighten up quit cutting the hire
[1:15:10] quick pint in the face and they're ready
[1:15:11] for the rapture well why are we doing
[1:15:16] here 50 years life
[1:15:23] you know we got Nana's great heritage
[1:15:26] the women didn't have to worry about
[1:15:28] cutting her a lot of falling out now you
[1:15:30] want to worry about it
[1:15:31] my wife she keeps on going with her
[1:15:33] going another year or two she's gonna be
[1:15:35] having to wear a wig because he's losing
[1:15:41] a lot of her heart the older you get you
[1:15:43] don't follow okay
[1:15:46] but listen do you see what I'm talking
[1:15:50] about see we don't wear earrings because
[1:15:59] of the top and what is that time what is
[1:16:06] the top that reason we don't worry tell
[1:16:13] me a commandment to not wear a ring but
[1:16:17] the top the top is what faith cometh by
[1:16:22] hearing and hearing comes through the
[1:16:26] ear so you don't you're not a slave
[1:16:33] you're free you get it tops tops brings
[1:16:40] us to the reality of Jesus Christ now we
[1:16:42] see why children that we don't worry
[1:16:45] about why because the world does show
[1:16:49] and they're sold out to a slave master
[1:16:54] we're not sold out to slave master we
[1:17:01] serve the one true and living God what
[1:17:05] about the
[1:17:08] two tables of stone the Ten Commandments
[1:17:13] you know what
[1:17:15] according to dedication the prophet
[1:17:19] teaching it the last thing that came in
[1:17:25] the building now I'm quoting brother
[1:17:27] Branham he says when they got the
[1:17:29] building complete he says there wasn't
[1:17:32] anything in the building but furniture
[1:17:34] that's whay said with nothing in the
[1:17:37] building but furniture the last thing to
[1:17:43] enter the building with what the Ark of
[1:17:49] the Covenant what was in the Ark of the
[1:17:53] Covenant the ten commandments what was
[1:18:00] the last thing to enter the temple the
[1:18:04] Ten Commandments when they brought it in
[1:18:08] and said it down took his place what
[1:18:15] happened to proving it was right what
[1:18:18] was taking place was correct what
[1:18:19] happened the Shekinah glory fell till
[1:18:23] they couldn't even minister you see why
[1:18:29] church did I believe the way I do you
[1:18:32] see well you're a funny guy
[1:18:40] Shekinah glory taken from dedication
[1:18:42] paragraph 80 there's a kind of glory
[1:18:44] that followed those capping stone not
[1:18:46] the corner the capping stone the main
[1:18:49] thing all other stones was of none
[1:18:52] effect until them but this main stone
[1:18:56] came in the headstone and took his place
[1:18:59] positionally for its resting place for
[1:19:01] that generation the glory of God filled
[1:19:04] a house where the people were sitting
[1:19:06] and there was this Shekinah glory upon
[1:19:08] the whole building and the glory was so
[1:19:10] great to a priest couldn't even minister
[1:19:12] cause of the glory right now read number
[1:19:20] 12 go ahead you got eleven at number
[1:19:23] eleven so go to number 12 you may have
[1:19:25] rest reading this the other day
[1:19:27] questions and answers 1954 brother give
[1:19:31] me a church full of the Holy Ghost God
[1:19:33] will do in one year or what all
[1:19:35] theologies failed to do in two thousand
[1:19:38] years
[1:19:39] you wait till they're knowing of the
[1:19:40] church really strikes home to that
[1:19:43] faithful the little remnant after the
[1:19:46] doors of the Gentiles is closed
[1:19:48] Oh God will anoint a church then he
[1:19:52] who's filthy let him be filthy still he
[1:19:54] who's righteous let him be righteous
[1:19:55] he's holy let him be holy and God will
[1:19:58] anoint the church with the power of God
[1:20:00] and things will be taking place not only
[1:20:03] that then but he's doing it now okay you
[1:20:10] remember this one that was number 11s
[1:20:14] cubed number twelve now which what shall
[1:20:17] I do with Jesus Christ sixty-three 1124
[1:20:20] the dynamics of this church will be a
[1:20:22] refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have
[1:20:24] worked in a small measure while the
[1:20:26] headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:20:27] the body but when that head and body
[1:20:30] your nots together the full power of the
[1:20:32] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[1:20:34] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:20:37] dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago
[1:20:40] will rise in the beauty of his holiness
[1:20:42] and take a flight to the skies the
[1:20:45] dynamics is the Holy Spirit three kinds
[1:20:49] of believers sixty-three 1124 that was
[1:20:52] 1124 morning the
[1:20:53] 11:24 evening that's the reason I do
[1:20:56] believe that when the bride is called
[1:20:58] out and elected and said in the book of
[1:21:00] life
[1:21:01] there will come a sound from heaven
[1:21:02] that'll take such a baptism of the Holy
[1:21:04] Spirit into that bride that'll take her
[1:21:07] from the earth in a rapture in grace God
[1:21:10] promised it God promised it brother Dale
[1:21:19] you're a funny person do you believe
[1:21:20] it's gonna be a revival oh no ain't
[1:21:25] gonna be no more rod ain't no we don't
[1:21:27] more revival this revival drover I got
[1:21:29] the quote I got to learn right here on
[1:21:31] rig 1 read the other one lets you decide
[1:21:34] okay the third seal 63 320 don't think
[1:21:43] we've got revivals we haven't oh we got
[1:21:45] millions and millions and but what
[1:21:47] millions of church members but not a
[1:21:50] revival know where I don't know the
[1:21:52] bride hasn't had a revival yet see
[1:21:55] there's been no revival there no
[1:21:58] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:22:00] yet see we're looking for it it will
[1:22:03] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:22:05] there to wake her up he will send it he
[1:22:07] promised it now now she was was dead
[1:22:11] alright now he says it's gonna come one
[1:22:15] now let's read another one going to 15
[1:22:18] the invisible union of the Bride of
[1:22:19] Christ priests in 6511 25 we're trying
[1:22:25] to relate people to deeper thoughts and
[1:22:27] higher objections believing that to come
[1:22:29] to the Lord Jesus is at hand we believe
[1:22:31] that much more it's 20 years closer than
[1:22:34] it was the first time I come to shriek
[1:22:35] oh oh so much has happened since that
[1:22:37] time now we're looking forward for the
[1:22:40] coming of the Lord in our generation I'm
[1:22:42] not looking for a revival in our
[1:22:45] generation I'm looking for the coming of
[1:22:47] the Lord in our generation - quotes
[1:22:56] one said sobriety had a revival and take
[1:22:58] the Thunder to wake her up the other one
[1:23:00] said looking for a revival in this
[1:23:02] generation you know what he's right on
[1:23:04] both statements most statements is
[1:23:09] 1,000% right no don't go in my head
[1:23:16] brother Dale well that's just where you
[1:23:17] don't think right
[1:23:19] you don't listen brother branham never
[1:23:23] looked for a world wide sweeping revival
[1:23:25] he said the Pentecostals was the last
[1:23:26] one until the two witnesses come I'll be
[1:23:31] glad to find these for years okay
[1:23:33] the two witnesses there'll be a revival
[1:23:36] it'll cover the world the bride is
[1:23:39] waiting for a revival at 8:07 on don't
[1:23:41] honor it's not the world woke up it's
[1:23:45] the bride the world ain't gonna have a
[1:23:48] revival mm-hmm but the bride is in a
[1:23:53] revival because she's in the opening of
[1:23:56] the word now both arms ride a world wide
[1:23:59] sweeping revivals not gonna happen no he
[1:24:03] said that's the two witnesses but then
[1:24:07] he says if there's a revival to wake the
[1:24:11] bride up an outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:15] to come when the building is completed
[1:24:17] to be exactly in top like it was back
[1:24:20] there you see how prophet can say things
[1:24:26] but if they're not brought out and put
[1:24:29] together by the Holy Spirit you've got
[1:24:34] two quotes running in opposite direction
[1:24:36] you want to stay all night long and by
[1:24:39] memory see how many by memory that I can
[1:24:43] remember of the statements he says one
[1:24:45] thing one way and one thing another what
[1:24:52] he corrected he corrected what he didn't
[1:24:56] correct
[1:24:57] we better believe there's something
[1:25:00] laying there that's wonderful
[1:25:05] just like he stated and the Bible stated
[1:25:11] the rule will bring forth a hitch tongue
[1:25:14] because he's already laid the foundation
[1:25:18] then he turns around and says not that
[1:25:23] cornerstone no see now you see what he's
[1:25:30] talking about the cornerstone was never
[1:25:33] eat away the church has still been built
[1:25:36] every age was built on the foundations
[1:25:38] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being
[1:25:40] the chief Cornerstone you realize what's
[1:25:45] taken place and will take place in this
[1:25:47] day come on musician you realize that
[1:25:50] what we're saying under this messenger
[1:25:54] the church will have to be rebuilt
[1:26:03] the church had to be revealed you want
[1:26:06] me to quote you want to quote good you
[1:26:08] know that read around them says what two
[1:26:10] Methodists well the Baptist eight we're
[1:26:15] gonna get into that one of these days
[1:26:19] you realize that what to method this and
[1:26:22] all them left the Pentecostals a towei
[1:26:25] who's he talking about she ain't the
[1:26:29] bride that old Berg is still eating he
[1:26:35] said you say you've had a lot of rain he
[1:26:38] says nonsense
[1:26:40] now that's perforating the quote but
[1:26:43] it's close he said you ain't had the
[1:26:46] former yet and I'll throw this because
[1:26:52] one day they come won't get to former in
[1:26:53] the latter right brother branham in the
[1:26:55] part that the Holy Spirit told him pick
[1:26:57] up his pen and write in that message he
[1:27:01] said this messenger in the last days
[1:27:05] would plant by the messenger in the
[1:27:12] former right
[1:27:21] that's a direct quote he's now it's
[1:27:25] lighter right you don't understand this
[1:27:31] messenger had to do two times he planted
[1:27:36] for the former Ryan the seals breakin
[1:27:40] was the latter rain breaking not read he
