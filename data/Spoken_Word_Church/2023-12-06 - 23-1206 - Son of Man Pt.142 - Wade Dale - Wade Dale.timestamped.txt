[7:41] change in plans on December 31st brother
[7:44] Luke's got something come up and he
[7:45] can't make it so we've asked someone
[7:50] else to
[7:52] uh um come and he hadn't got back with
[7:55] me yet but so I w't announce until he
[7:57] says yes so um it's someone you know but
[8:01] um remember brother Lis brother Aaron
[8:03] Brother Christian they're all Aaron's
[8:06] getting ready to come back here pretty
[8:07] quick and and I think they're having a
[8:10] real good time brother Aaron's getting
[8:11] uh uh he's getting baptized over there
[8:14] with a 100 degree heat and and um and
[8:18] all that so what do you expect when you
[8:20] go there I mean you know you don't
[8:21] expect cool days you're next to the
[8:24] equator that's where the oven is so same
[8:27] way we being in Jamaica you know the in
[8:29] Jamaica in in January at winter time in
[8:33] Jamaica it's still 88° but the wind's
[8:36] blowing in June when it's hot summer in
[8:39] Jamaica it's 88 degrees no wind blowing
[8:43] so that's the only difference in when
[8:44] you get into that um middle part of the
[8:47] earth the the temperature doesn't
[8:49] fluctuate very much so um so let's keep
[8:51] them in prayer that they'll stay
[8:52] hydrated brother Lis I'm sure he's he's
[8:56] been preaching double and triple time so

[10:59] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[11:01] among us and we beheld his glory the
[11:04] glory of the only begotten of the father
[11:06] full of grace and truth you may be
[11:09] seated and Lord add his Blessing to the
[11:11] reading of the word we um we had a good
[11:14] time Sunday afternoon I really enjoyed
[11:16] that I was it was um it was a bit visual
[11:21] but we had a u we had a good time trying
[11:23] to explain and we're going to talk a
[11:25] little bit more about tonight on
[11:27] dispensation
[11:30] but I wanted you to understand something
[11:32] when when we were talking about the
[11:34] water and it being the Holy
[11:36] Spirit you know inside that water that
[11:40] I'm looking at right here and you're
[11:41] looking at this it it's
[11:44] it's it has substance right you see that
[11:47] it's got substance to it you can drink
[11:48] it it's got minerals it's got all
[11:50] different things but inside that are
[11:53] molecules that you can't
[11:55] see but if you take all the molecules
[11:58] out all the water comes out so it takes
[12:01] all the molecules and that water that I
[12:03] was using the other the the Sunday the
[12:06] water that I was using see that's why we
[12:09] don't believe in pre-existence of souls
[12:11] we don't believe that we were something
[12:13] back there we were nothing we were a
[12:15] molecule in the mind of God we were we
[12:18] were a molecule part if God was water we
[12:20] were just a piece of that water but now
[12:22] that piece of that water is God the part
[12:24] of that water is God every molecule in
[12:26] this right here besides the outer shell
[12:29] hello besides the outer shell is God
[12:32] that water in there that's all water all
[12:34] right so that's the same way with God so
[12:36] all God was he poured into Christ and it
[12:39] wasn't that he lost his his fathership
[12:42] it just that he moved over into another
[12:44] form or began another dispensation and
[12:48] that's what we're going to talk about a
[12:49] little bit tonight heading toward the
[12:51] headstone because these are all
[12:53] dispensations all brother Bown said he
[12:55] was a dispensationalist and God is a
[12:57] dispensationalist will
[12:59] look at that in just a minute but in
[13:01] Colossians it says for by him were all
[13:03] things created what we were talking
[13:05] about Sunday that are in heaven Earth
[13:07] visible invisible whether they be
[13:10] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[13:11] or Powers all things were created by Him
[13:14] and for him you know you drive down the
[13:16] road as as we're having our
[13:20] wonderful um overload of packages it
[13:24] slows you down just a little bit so you
[13:25] can start reflecting a little bit on
[13:27] what's going on outside and um you see
[13:30] all everything that was everything was
[13:32] created there's not one thing that you
[13:33] have seen with your natural eye that God
[13:35] didn't create now man put it together
[13:38] and made different things out of it but
[13:40] all the elements that takes for any of
[13:42] this you see plus
[13:45] you came from him all right so
[13:48] everything emanated from him and listen
[13:50] he doesn't make any mistakes so he
[13:52] didn't have to start over again now
[13:54] listen I was going back to that um
[13:57] scripture the other day and
[13:59] and I just kept going over my mind where
[14:01] Paul says until Christ be formed in you
[14:06] all right see until Christ be formed in
[14:09] you cuz remember you're a newborn baby
[14:11] in Christ you're not a full stature
[14:13] you're not the full as the Potter wheel
[14:15] would would put the glob of of clay and
[14:19] and if you walk by and looked at it You'
[14:20] just saw a pot just a glob of clay but
[14:23] inside that clay the master the master
[14:26] Potter he's already seen how much he
[14:28] needs needs to make his b
[14:31] vase so um so he's got that and he makes
[14:35] it and you know he don't make any
[14:36] mistakes but if but but we do right so
[14:40] our Clay is flawed because every once in
[14:43] a while there might be a little piece of
[14:44] dirt that don't need to be there there
[14:46] might be a a little clot I've noticed
[14:48] when we were a long time ago that the uh
[14:51] brother uh that Joe Craven and some of
[14:53] the different ones and our cousins I
[14:55] mean they were just they were just
[14:56] Masters in doing it but all of a sudden
[14:59] inside that brother George that'd be a a
[15:01] twig they try to run it through a filter
[15:04] the best they can but there'd be a
[15:05] little something that would that would
[15:07] kind of knock it off well they' pull
[15:09] that out and they' spack that thing they
[15:10] didn't throw the Clay Away they put the
[15:13] clay back on the wheel and started all
[15:15] over again and made what they were
[15:17] trying to make the first place well God
[15:19] did the same thing he's going to make
[15:21] what he started in the first place
[15:23] brother John all right so by him who him
[15:27] by God all things were created by Him
[15:29] and for him and he is before all things
[15:32] and by him all things consist now here's
[15:35] where we're at today he is the head of
[15:37] the body the church all right so he's
[15:39] the head we're the body all right now I
[15:42] didn't choose that you didn't choose
[15:44] that God chose that right all right God
[15:46] chose it to be this whole way this whole
[15:48] thing God chose this and this is where
[15:50] it's going to be and and we can't change
[15:53] it you can't change God's mind right you
[15:56] can't change it you that's why we have
[15:57] to as I was telling my my dentist today
[16:00] she was talking about a problem she was
[16:02] having with her kids and she said well
[16:04] I'm telling them this and I'm telling
[16:05] them that and I said you know I said
[16:07] just get out of the way and just you
[16:08] know back off a little bit they're
[16:10] 20-some years old I said you know Dwight
[16:12] Moody said said God will only fill those
[16:14] that are not full of their self I said
[16:16] so let's don't get full of ourself and
[16:18] think we can handle everything let's
[16:19] just give it to God all right give it to
[16:22] God and he'll never make a mistake he's
[16:24] always right he's always on time he's
[16:25] never off amen that's kind of God I
[16:28] serve and then if something does happen
[16:30] around me as brother Bob says wonky are
[16:34] a little off all right it's not God it's
[16:38] me okay cuz God's not that way but it's
[16:42] me but now what am I doing I'm going
[16:44] through these tests and trials to get
[16:47] over into that perfect will of
[16:49] God because to come to The Headstone you
[16:51] got to be in the perfect will of God
[16:53] Amen all right because Jesus Christ was
[16:56] the perfect will of God he wasn't he was
[16:58] wasn't part-time sometime he was the
[17:00] perfect will of God because he was God
[17:02] walking on the earth in two in two feet
[17:05] now he's doing that in me and you
[17:07] because he's transferred that part of
[17:08] him into us all right so he's the head
[17:11] of the body of the church who is the
[17:13] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[17:16] remember he had to die he had to die so
[17:18] you don't have to all right that in all
[17:21] things he might have the preeminence
[17:23] there's the whole thing we got to give
[17:24] him the preeminence get out of the way
[17:26] brother George amen get out of the away
[17:30] die and let him live for look so it
[17:33] pleased the father that in him should
[17:35] all F fullness dwell now look if it
[17:37] pleased the father that in him Christ
[17:40] all fullness should dwell then what is
[17:43] lost between there and putting it in us
[17:46] nothing there's nothing lost so he's
[17:49] pleased that in all the fullness dwell
[17:51] in the bright that all the fulls dwell
[17:53] in a
[17:54] bride all right to Revelations 3:14
[17:57] let's this is our age and this is for us
[18:00] this is our as we're going to say
[18:02] dispensation right not the other ones we
[18:05] didn't have the one where you have a
[18:06] name that you're dead we already know
[18:08] that that happened and it's still
[18:10] happening now but this is today the
[18:12] bride age this is to the
[18:15] bride to the updated bride the ones that
[18:18] are alive the ones that are passed on
[18:19] they are not hearing this
[18:21] sermon right all right and to the angel
[18:25] of the Church of the L of see write
[18:26] these things sayith the amen the
[18:29] faithful and true witness now not that
[18:30] it was false at any time but watch what
[18:33] that word true means it's just like you
[18:36] take a tuning fork and I don't know a
[18:37] whole lot about um music but that tuning
[18:41] fork when it's a whatever it is whatever
[18:44] C D or what G or whatever chord it is if
[18:47] you got that one thing you know it
[18:49] sticks up like this and you hit it and
[18:50] it
[18:51] vibrates that's a tuning fork right and
[18:55] it's the true sound that it makes when
[18:57] you hit it it it's a true sound that it
[18:59] makes so that doesn't mean that it's
[19:02] false but it mean it means it comes to a
[19:04] tress or
[19:06] watch the beginning of the creation of
[19:08] God and we talked about that Sunday you
[19:10] and I are the continuation of that
[19:12] creation that which has not only the
[19:15] name and resemblance because remember
[19:17] back in the church other Church ages he
[19:18] says you got a name that you call but
[19:20] you're dead all right which is a father
[19:23] son Holy Ghost baptism or Jesus is the
[19:25] second person of the Trinity right but
[19:28] that was a dispensation that God said
[19:29] that's okay for the
[19:33] time but now when we come up to the the
[19:37] what the faithful and true
[19:40] witness here
[19:42] today it's the real nature corresponding
[19:46] to the name so when we because brother R
[19:49] and that always kind of tripped me up
[19:52] when I hear Brother R say they'll say
[19:54] Jesus Jesus and not get anything well I
[19:56] thought man if you calling the name of
[19:58] Jesus and you were pretty sincere about
[20:00] it then he had to answer but if you call
[20:02] Jesus Jesus and you're talking about the
[20:05] second person of Trinity
[20:07] right or the second personage of
[20:10] God he don't have
[20:13] to respond to that name right all right
[20:17] to prove that I'll show it to you in
[20:19] just a minute well I don't think I put
[20:20] it in here but there's one kind of like
[20:21] it remember when the U the woman was uh
[20:25] that got that Jesus called a dog
[20:27] remember she was a gentile
[20:28] she saids son of David Son of David have
[20:31] mercy on me son of David well brother
[20:33] Ram said he didn't H he did not answer
[20:35] her remember he didn't even it just like
[20:37] you wasn't even there right
[20:40] right cuz that wasn't his title at the
[20:43] time right but when she said Lord she
[20:45] entered into a place then it was a true
[20:48] witness standing there that she was
[20:51] corresponding to she said my
[20:53] Lord Y and her daughter was
[20:56] healed right amen so that's the same way
[20:59] with me and you that's why that you can
[21:01] have so much of Christianity out in the
[21:03] world and they're able to do whatever
[21:05] they want to now in the end time I mean
[21:07] I mean everything and still be a
[21:10] Christian right so that's not the true
[21:13] nature it's not a true witness the bride
[21:16] is the only true witness of God Amen all
[21:18] right the others are false and they may
[21:21] be true to a point because the foolish
[21:23] virgin is a virgin all right she's
[21:27] trying but she just can't get there but
[21:30] the real nature corresponding to the
[21:32] name in every respect corresponding to
[21:35] the idea signified by the name real true
[21:38] genuine so in every respect we should
[21:40] know Jesus Christ more than any other
[21:43] Church age
[21:45] Hallelujah that's what's given to us we
[21:47] should know who this man is where he's
[21:49] at what his character is and where he
[21:53] resides cuz I'm going to read it to you
[21:55] in a minute that if you overcome in this
[21:57] say age guess what you get to do you
[22:01] don't get to sit on his
[22:02] throne you get to sit in his throne
[22:05] right which means you sit there with him
[22:08] and actually he's inside of
[22:10] you all
[22:13] right I think about many times Dwight
[22:17] Moody and different ones that that that
[22:19] we uh rever as and they are they were
[22:22] for their time and for their
[22:23] dispensation they were the truth right
[22:25] but the way they read scripture now
[22:27] could they read Revelations 3:14 brother
[22:29] Bob and read it just like we read it
[22:31] just now I don't think so no because the
[22:34] Revelation wasn't there they didn't have
[22:36] the Revelation actually Dwight Moody was
[22:38] a trinitarian so he didn't have that
[22:40] Revelation and he wasn't able to sit
[22:42] down with the Lord in his throne and not
[22:46] on his throne all
[22:48] right so brother Ram says look we'll
[22:52] talk about dispensation right here now
[22:54] when Jesus came to Earth he came in the
[22:55] name of Three Sons son of man which is
[22:58] Prophet Son of God and Son of David all
[23:01] right so now let me just show you let's
[23:04] just look at this chart just for a
[23:05] minute well let's do this because he
[23:10] came as the son of man before the church
[23:12] ages began he was the son of man right
[23:17] now before that he was Son of God in the
[23:19] Old Testament as
[23:22] Jehovah all right Jehovah right so that
[23:26] was the son of God that was the spirit
[23:28] of God that would come on to Moses and
[23:30] come off of Moses that would come on to
[23:33] David and then come off of David and
[23:35] then come on Ezekiel and Isaiah and all
[23:37] the different ones he would anoint them
[23:40] to do the things that they were supposed
[23:41] to do but yet he had he couldn't indwell
[23:45] them because they didn't have anything
[23:46] to to eradicate sin they only had
[23:48] something to cover all right so that's
[23:51] very Elementary but we got to get here
[23:52] somewhere Son of God then is the spirit
[23:55] of God that went through the went
[23:57] through the ages I'm talking about old
[23:59] ages I'm talking about the church ages
[24:00] in the Old Testament he went through
[24:02] those Church ages in the Old Testament
[24:06] and he raised up a group of people there
[24:07] was a group of people that was that was
[24:09] going to make it that was going to be
[24:12] the the Patriarchs and Abraham Isaac
[24:14] Jacob Joseph different ones but they
[24:16] weren't his children they weren't his
[24:18] progyny they weren't his bride right
[24:20] they couldn't call him that right that's
[24:24] right he never called Abraham his son he
[24:27] called his friend right amen come on
[24:30] that's right you see how the scripture
[24:32] is perfect when it starts talking and
[24:34] but see you and I can see the difference
[24:37] in all that right we can see the
[24:39] difference in the as brother Dale
[24:40] preached many years ago about the
[24:42] capital letters capital l r d me God
[24:44] speaking direct from himself to somebody
[24:47] instead of the lowercase LD which is
[24:50] thus sayith the Lord coming from someone
[24:52] to someone else all right if you don't
[24:54] get if you don't know anything about
[24:55] that we ought to go back we may play
[24:57] that sometime cuz that's a really good
[25:00] really good U series he did on the
[25:03] punctuations and the and the capital
[25:05] letters there're there for a purpose
[25:06] because you keep reading in the Bible
[25:08] and you see this capital letter where it
[25:09] shouldn't be then you see capital l d
[25:13] different from lowercase even lowercase
[25:16] LD King of Kings Capital Lord of lords
[25:19] small then we get down to the end where
[25:22] it's all capitalized King of Kings Lord
[25:24] of lords which is all of us in together
[25:26] there in Revelations 19 it has a meaning
[25:28] to it like these dispensations like
[25:30] these like these name listen like I said
[25:33] before these
[25:35] names Luther couldn't sit and say look
[25:38] we're under the son of man Ministry
[25:40] we're under the son of man anointing he
[25:43] didn't have a I don't say he didn't have
[25:44] a clue he did not know what he was
[25:46] talking about when he even said son of
[25:48] man he just knew that Jesus called
[25:50] himself the son of man right all right
[25:53] that's well see now we know why though
[25:56] we know why he called his self the son
[25:58] of man we know why that he was the son
[26:01] of God through seven Church ages as the
[26:03] spirit of God back again like he was in
[26:05] the Old Testament but this time he was
[26:07] going to birth a group of people not
[26:09] just anoint them and then come off of
[26:11] them he was going to dwell in them and
[26:13] stay in
[26:14] them but see with that though now with
[26:18] that we can go back to the son of man
[26:21] again just for a moment right in the end
[26:23] time according to Luke Luke 17:30 the
[26:27] day when the Sun a man's being
[26:29] revealed so now he lived here on Earth
[26:31] he never did say he was the son of God
[26:34] he said I'm the son of man Jehovah
[26:35] himself called Ezekiel and the prophets
[26:38] son of man if you look in the Book of
[26:39] Ezekiel it says prophesy son of man
[26:41] prophesy son of man because he had to
[26:44] come to fulfill scripture as a prophet
[26:47] Moses said the Lord your God shall raise
[26:48] up a prophet like an unto me that's the
[26:51] reason he could not be the Son of God
[26:53] there because he was the son of man all
[26:56] right so we'll talk about this
[26:57] dispensation I'll read a little bit what
[26:59] um um about what is a
[27:02] dispensation because the word came to
[27:04] the prophets and he was the word look in
[27:06] his fullness all right son of man the
[27:08] major prophet not the major prophet but
[27:11] the god
[27:12] Prophet Ezekiel had a part each one had
[27:15] a part to play all right but he was the
[27:18] fullness and that's what made him the
[27:20] son of man he was the fullness of the
[27:22] godhead bodily and what did he do he
[27:24] fulfilled every scripture that they said
[27:27] about him in the Old Testament fulfilled
[27:29] it in the New Testament all right
[27:32] thereby with me all right well we know
[27:34] he lived in the Old Testament but it was
[27:36] when Paul would speak of him he would
[27:38] speak of him never said much about son
[27:40] of man if you look in your new testament
[27:42] son of man's not mentioned many many
[27:44] times except Jesus Calling himself the
[27:46] son of
[27:47] man cuz he was really listen he was the
[27:49] only one that understood right what the
[27:52] son of man was only one and really only
[27:56] one till the end time till our
[27:58] dispensation did that they said well he
[28:00] might be this cuz listen you can't make
[28:02] God the son of man and and break him up
[28:05] into three people right you can't do
[28:08] that but they look at him and see well
[28:11] there's somebody there's a God in flesh
[28:13] so they must be another God up here that
[28:14] he prayed to so there must be one up
[28:16] here one here and then oh Jesus stood
[28:18] one day and said I'm going to send a
[28:20] comforter so there's number
[28:24] three
[28:26] amen therefore he was the son of man why
[28:31] because he was the fullness of the
[28:33] godhead bodily all right no one else
[28:36] could claim that and no one else can
[28:38] claim it till now but you and I like I
[28:40] said before Sunday we're now in a many
[28:43] membered body but we have the same
[28:46] anointing the same Holy
[28:49] Ghost amen it's just in each form called
[28:52] a bride right all right in our names
[28:57] that are being called from that book of
[29:00] redemption everybody with
[29:03] me now for 2,000 years he's been known
[29:06] as the Son of God so that's the Son of
[29:07] God
[29:08] dispensation which is God not in human
[29:12] flesh his own human
[29:14] flesh he's now poured himself into a
[29:18] bride but right around the coming of the
[29:20] Lord he's got to come back as the son of
[29:22] man to bring back the
[29:25] resurrection who was resurrected the son
[29:28] of man was resurrected Son of God never
[29:30] needed a resurrection he never died but
[29:34] that son of man died in human flesh he
[29:37] died that human flesh died God can't die
[29:40] but his human flesh did all right died
[29:43] for me and
[29:44] you should everybody with me so look I
[29:48] got this off the internet must be true
[29:50] dispens sectionalism is a theological
[29:53] framework of interpreting the Bible look
[29:56] which maintains that history is divided
[29:58] into multiple ages or dispensations now
[30:01] watch in which God acts with his look
[30:04] chosen people I like that that was good
[30:07] I read through several commentaries this
[30:09] is the best one to explain what I want
[30:11] to tonight God acts with his chosen
[30:13] people in different ways not that God's
[30:16] different right but he acts in different
[30:19] ways so that you can understand it
[30:22] everybody with me on that
[30:24] dispensationalists use a literal
[30:26] interpretation of the Bible that's us
[30:29] and believe that divine revelation look
[30:31] unfolds throughout the Bible this is not
[30:33] a message believer but it sounds pretty
[30:36] good they believe that there's a
[30:38] distinction between Israel and the
[30:40] church praise God that's right because
[30:43] remember we have a problem well we don't
[30:45] now but we had a problem in
[30:47] denominations who is this 144,000 who is
[30:51] this Souls under the altar even brother
[30:54] Bram did for a little while he thought
[30:56] those Souls under the altar was the
[30:57] Christians amen until God showed him
[30:59] they were Jews that were given eternal
[31:02] life because of their stand and being
[31:05] just a
[31:07] Jew so now Christians are not bound to
[31:11] Mosaic law now you understand what I'm
[31:12] saying but that don't mean we throw the
[31:14] Ten Commandments out I know what the
[31:15] man's talking about because eye for an
[31:17] eye we don't do that our Revelations
[31:20] come up higher right right right right
[31:25] Jesus said you heard of all but I say
[31:26] unto you
[31:27] right if you don't touch them out here
[31:29] in the Old Testament you're
[31:32] okay but he exposed them when he come
[31:34] over here and he said hey you even look
[31:36] at them and lust after them in your
[31:37] heart you've done it already he didn't
[31:40] do away with the law he done what the
[31:41] Bible said he magnified the law and make
[31:45] it made it livable or
[31:48] honorable so Christians are not bound by
[31:51] Mosaic law which we're not bound by that
[31:53] we understand that because look I mean
[31:55] if we just s did the law of Moses we'd
[31:56] be
[31:58] Israelites okay and remember they're
[32:01] looking for a messiah we know he's
[32:04] already come right amen so they maintain
[32:08] beliefs in premillennial millennialism
[32:10] and the future restoration of national
[32:11] Israel which we do too and a Rapture of
[32:14] the church that will happen before the
[32:15] second coming of Christ generally seen
[32:18] as happening before a period of
[32:19] tribulation which sounds good so
[32:22] dispensationalism now brother randam
[32:24] they ask him he's on the future home now
[32:27] this is a real good example because in
[32:29] the future home he's preaching he's
[32:31] preaching a seventh day he's preaching
[32:33] on um seventh day of the Millennium and
[32:36] he's he's typing it as the old seventh
[32:38] day and everything's in the seven right
[32:41] all right they said Oh Brother R said
[32:43] you've run out of types that's what he
[32:45] this whole quote is is they said oh
[32:47] brother rown said what are you going to
[32:49] do now you've run out of your complete
[32:51] sevens what are you going to do now now
[32:54] you're a dispensationalist which I am
[32:56] and I believe that God is too so he goes
[32:58] on to tell and plainly reads that there
[33:01] is an eighth day sanctification or an
[33:04] eighth day over even in the Old
[33:07] Testament that types the future home not
[33:11] the
[33:13] Millennium all right the Millennium is
[33:15] still in time the Millennium all the way
[33:17] up to the white Throne judgment is still
[33:19] in time it's still the old seventh day
[33:22] everybody with me on that the only time
[33:25] you come to a total Eternal condition
[33:28] now not us we're already done before
[33:31] that but I'm talking about a literal
[33:33] Earth and everybody else that's on the
[33:35] earth cuz when we get in the Millennium
[33:37] there'll be some people that are not
[33:38] Eternal Satan's still going to be
[33:40] here he's going to be bound but he ain't
[33:43] going to be done away with when you get
[33:44] over into the eighth day I hope somebody
[33:46] sees this when you get over into that
[33:48] Eighth Day which we should be typing it
[33:50] now when you get over in eth day Satan's
[33:53] gone Satan's
[33:55] dead and and his little imps and all the
[33:59] pain and suffering and that's right
[34:02] that's why that future home I love that
[34:04] book I've always said brother Mark if if
[34:05] they took every book away from me don't
[34:07] give me the seal book The Church age
[34:08] book give me the future home that book
[34:10] tells you when you got born again it
[34:12] tells you where you going that's good
[34:13] enough for me and then I'll let God fill
[34:16] the rest of it
[34:18] in but I believe it God is too so we
[34:21] live in
[34:23] dispensations there was a um uh dad's
[34:27] oldest brother Marshall we were having a
[34:30] he asked me to speak at a at a breakfast
[34:31] they had and uh there was a young
[34:34] Minister there and he he started asking
[34:36] dad about um Martin Luther and I mean
[34:40] asked about John Wesley and John
[34:43] Wesley's the founder of the Methodist
[34:44] church and we were standing in a
[34:45] Methodist Church you know and you know
[34:49] and and Marshall said then we started
[34:51] talking about church ages and about this
[34:53] one coming and that one coming well here
[34:55] we're talking about Luther and Wesley
[34:56] and some he should know hello I mean you
[34:59] ought to know who your founder is right
[35:02] oh that ain't nothing got nothing to do
[35:03] with it that's just something Paul wrote
[35:05] I mean John wrote and and there ain't
[35:07] nothing to that at all there ain't no
[35:09] this age and that man and this time and
[35:11] all that cuz see he knew that we were
[35:13] supposed to be built on a
[35:15] man and you know Daddy said well well
[35:18] that's when Daddy said well I said your
[35:19] founder was a man too his name was John
[35:23] Wesley right so so you were founded on a
[35:25] man all right
[35:28] so he just walked
[35:30] away but we are dispensationalist I
[35:32] believe in dispensation of the Son of
[35:34] God I believe in a dispensation of the
[35:35] son of man also believe in a
[35:37] dispensation of the son of David but
[35:39] that's not to us that has nothing to do
[35:41] with us because we're not Jews so we
[35:43] have separated that part away from in
[35:45] the Millennium he is going to be the son
[35:48] of David because he promised the throne
[35:50] would never be without a son of David
[35:54] right that's right and he was going to
[35:55] rule and Reign the 12 Tri tribes of
[35:57] Israel now listen he's not going to rule
[35:59] and Reign me and you he's already done
[36:01] that down here that's right amen listen
[36:05] that's what the perfect thing to me
[36:06] about the bride is I think about the
[36:09] other day I'm going try to explain it
[36:10] the way I got it then what this the
[36:13] Bible is is spreading all this out Son
[36:15] of God Son of Man son of David everybody
[36:19] with me and then most of see then Satan
[36:22] will jump in there and he said oh you'll
[36:24] get it over there or oh it don't matter
[36:26] if you go through a little bit you know
[36:28] three and a half years of tribulation
[36:29] you you can get saved and then there's
[36:31] three and a half more years of
[36:32] tribulation and then you get saved at
[36:34] the end of that just don't worry about
[36:35] it everything's
[36:37] okay well that's the devil just keep
[36:39] what what do we do we procrastinate we
[36:41] keep pushing stuff back pushing stuff
[36:44] back no we get everything
[36:47] here we even get a body change right
[36:50] here so when you get a body change
[36:52] you're done what else do you need you
[36:54] just need to hold on a little while wait
[36:57] on the wait on the Jews to catch up come
[37:00] on wait on the earth to catch up we've
[37:02] already in it now we're in the 8th day
[37:05] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are
[37:07] in our future home you're you're setting
[37:09] in it
[37:12] today cuz John saw it coming out of
[37:15] Heaven he said it looked like a what a
[37:17] bride adorned for her husband so all he
[37:20] done is he saw the millions of bride
[37:22] coming down that's right amen and that
[37:25] City just sitting on that Hill and and
[37:27] guess what brother Donnie you ain't got
[37:28] to get a GPS to find out where you going
[37:30] to have a house exactly no I believe
[37:32] you'll land right where you're supposed
[37:33] to
[37:35] right and then you'll be able to travel
[37:37] like a thought amen we have to worry
[37:39] about electric cars and gas cars and
[37:41] have to worry about OPEC or another that
[37:42] junk praise the
[37:44] Lord but we get it now though by the
[37:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost your soul
[37:48] today is sitting in Heavenly places your
[37:50] soul today as I've said many times
[37:52] before is an eternal person and it's in
[37:54] eternity that's right that's right
[37:56] that's right listen that's where you get
[37:58] Revelation yeah cuz understand one
[38:01] thing's for
[38:02] sure sister Alicia this is not the way
[38:06] it should have been there should have
[38:08] been no sorrow no death no pain no Agony
[38:10] but God in his heart he was a
[38:14] Healer in his heart he wanted to save
[38:17] something amen cuz he knew we'd get lost
[38:20] he wanted to redeem us so in other words
[38:24] for him to be that
[38:27] somebody had to be lost right really
[38:29] simple to understand the Plan of
[38:31] Redemption he didn't make Adam lose get
[38:34] lost he didn't make Eve get lost he gave
[38:36] him an opportunity to not because he
[38:38] said if you don't do that you'll live
[38:41] but if you do that you'll die right
[38:44] that's pretty black and white plain as
[38:45] could be do it and live don't do it or
[38:48] don't do it and live do it and die well
[38:51] they did it and they died but God knew
[38:53] that so he made a provision already he
[38:55] killed a lamb he slayed a lamb but the
[38:56] foundation before the foundation world
[38:58] in his
[38:59] mind and then he developed that plan
[39:02] down here and started in dispensation
[39:05] there was a dispensation of of Adam cuz
[39:07] there was an Adam a race of
[39:10] Adam listen there was a race of Adam all
[39:13] the way up to the flood till you come up
[39:15] to Abraham that that was not even a
[39:18] law come on there was 2,000 years that
[39:22] there was not I mean yeah there were
[39:24] sacrifices and yeah they were
[39:27] had laws maybe passed down from verbal
[39:29] from from Adam to to Seth and Seth said
[39:32] well now we need to make a sacrifice and
[39:34] and self s children says okay we need to
[39:36] make a sacrifice but they didn't have
[39:38] any there was no there was no promise in
[39:40] between those 2,000 years until after
[39:43] the flood then God steps back on the
[39:44] scene says okay all right hold on now
[39:47] you do this and do this and do this and
[39:49] do this multiply and replenish the Earth
[39:51] we're going to repopulate this thing
[39:53] we're going to start all over again but
[39:55] I'm never going to do it this way again
[39:56] I'm not going to wipe everything off
[39:58] brother George but by fire not by water
[40:01] all
[40:02] right that's God's plan it's perfect
[40:05] it's
[40:06] beautiful but we get everything
[40:08] everything that I'm spreading out that
[40:09] we're talking about everything that we
[40:12] look at a future home if you're born
[40:14] again right this
[40:16] moment you've punched your ticket right
[40:19] amen you don't have to worry what what
[40:22] street you're going to be on you don't
[40:23] even have to worry about going to any
[40:25] kind of judgment except the Judgment of
[40:27] the Deeds that you done in the body not
[40:28] a Qui thrown
[40:30] judgment and you're just what we're
[40:32] doing is is listen if God waited for
[40:35] 6,000 years for us to come to this place
[40:38] why can't we wait a thousand years for
[40:40] everybody else to come to this
[40:42] place like the Jews and the Millennium
[40:45] the the Heathen and different ones and
[40:47] then then we're just going to be there
[40:49] in a honeymoon it's not going to hurt us
[40:50] nothing's going to bother us nothing's
[40:51] going to uh we're we're actually uh
[40:54] standing in our future home but but
[40:56] there's a dispensation that God's got to
[40:59] get the Jews together that's right
[41:03] through two prophets amen they're not
[41:05] here now so I mean yeah they're over
[41:07] there but they're not preaching now
[41:09] they're not Believers now that's right
[41:12] so there must be a dispensation we'll
[41:13] get into that maybe a little bit later
[41:15] on we'll talk about the interval but not
[41:17] today we maybe a little bit couple more
[41:19] Sundays cuz we touched on the intervals
[41:22] this past uh Sunday afternoon but
[41:25] there's a brother B tell us and I didn't
[41:26] read the quote but I'll read it tonight
[41:29] where there's something happens
[41:30] something goes on during that interval
[41:31] well the interval the interval between
[41:34] us and the Millennium is the bringing in
[41:36] of the Jews right all right now listen
[41:39] you and I are spiritual Jews right we're
[41:42] not natural Jews we're not counted one
[41:45] to 12,000 to 144,000 and we get two
[41:48] prophets and
[41:50] listen they got a Time
[41:53] Clock they punch a Time Clock they got
[41:55] 1200 160 days and that's
[41:58] it you and I are Gentiles we have time
[42:02] no longer they have time times and the
[42:04] dividing of times they've got 1260 days
[42:07] to get this message right that's three
[42:10] and a half years but that's not really
[42:11] three and a half of our calendar years
[42:13] is 1260 days of the prophetic calendar
[42:17] which is 360 days and ours is 360 5 and
[42:20] the fourth all right right so that'll
[42:23] help you in Daniel 70 weeks if youone
[42:25] studied that that'll help you that if
[42:26] you'll get you to get your numbers right
[42:29] so brother said the other night he come
[42:31] in three names name the Son of God Son
[42:34] of Man son of David when he was on Earth
[42:37] the first time he was the son of man he
[42:39] could not be the Son of God now you
[42:41] can't you can't listen to brother Ram
[42:43] where brother Ram say God can't do
[42:46] this that's what he said he could not be
[42:51] the Son of God
[42:52] then he never claimed to be why because
[42:56] a dispensation of the Son of God meant
[42:58] that God was in spirit form and he was
[43:01] out over the people above them all right
[43:04] now the son of man is that that Son of
[43:07] God in a
[43:09] human called the son of man so now that
[43:12] dispensation of whatever the time Jesus
[43:15] lived 30 years and preached for three
[43:17] and a half
[43:19] years and then that went away right
[43:23] because the Bible says The Headstone was
[43:25] rejected yeah The Headstone was taken
[43:27] off The Headstone was the son of man
[43:29] amen they had no other recollection even
[43:32] the great Paul and different ones never
[43:35] really understood they called him the
[43:37] Son of God the Son of God the Son of God
[43:39] the Son of God they knew he was the
[43:41] creator in human flesh but they never
[43:44] understood how
[43:45] close that really
[43:48] is because they had that same Spirit
[43:50] they just didn't realize it because it
[43:53] the dispensation wasn't for them to get
[43:56] get it the dispensation today is for us
[43:59] to get
[43:59] it the there is not another dispensation
[44:03] except Israel so if you're a Jew you
[44:05] might have a shot but if you're a
[44:08] gentile when this dispensation is over
[44:10] it's
[44:11] done it's done for the Gentiles I'm
[44:14] telling you you when that door closes
[44:15] when that door of the Ark closed and man
[44:18] didn't close it no preacher closed it
[44:21] right Noah didn't close it that's right
[44:24] God closed the door right right he said
[44:27] get in the ark I'm
[44:28] done there's got to be a time limit
[44:33] somewhere same way with
[44:35] us amen he said he was the son of man
[44:39] when anybody would question him he'd say
[44:41] you see the son of man son of man now
[44:43] son of man is a prophet he had to come
[44:45] that way cu the scripture he cannot come
[44:47] contrary to the scripture that's why
[44:49] today our message now watch our message
[44:51] of this hour cannot come through the
[44:54] theologians and theologies all right
[44:56] what's he saying it can't come through
[44:58] cus right and Gia
[45:02] amen even how great they were maybe not
[45:04] cus but Gia and Nicodemus it's not a
[45:08] Nicodemus Doctrine anymore it's not a
[45:09] Gia Doctrine
[45:11] anymore we've come up to now to where
[45:14] we're looking at that same guy in human
[45:15] flesh that Ministry is right back in
[45:18] power again and that's what brother
[45:20] randam is bringing to us and as we we
[45:22] won't get to it this afternoon or
[45:24] tonight but that's why that door opens
[45:27] there's a door opens what the seals open
[45:30] the book opens you got all this open
[45:33] stuff over here in Revelations in the
[45:36] dispensation of the son of man amen
[45:38] which is right now our dispensation all
[45:41] right now look the Son of God
[45:43] dispensation is still going though right
[45:46] it's not stopping until the Gentile
[45:48] doors closed right but there's a son of
[45:51] man Revelation that's going to change
[45:53] somebody's body and take these people
[45:55] that have been under this Revelation
[45:57] that it went on and passed on it'll
[45:59] bring them out of the
[46:03] ground that's why today our message of
[46:05] this hour cannot come through
[46:06] theologians and theology it's got to
[46:08] come back to the same thing it promised
[46:10] to do it must be that way so we find out
[46:13] in this man he had to be a prophet not a
[46:17] son of God there he had to be a son of
[46:19] man now we explained that with the with
[46:21] the thing s Sunday so you ought to be
[46:24] able to understand that and but
[46:30] remember God when he as far as the
[46:33] church ages go you know brother Dell
[46:34] preached many years ago and even brother
[46:36] Brown says that that it's not an Abrupt
[46:38] end of one and a beginning of another
[46:41] all right so you know the first church
[46:43] Ephesus Church age didn't abruptly end
[46:46] on January the 26th that's my birthday
[46:49] January coming up pretty soon January
[46:54] 26 202
[46:56] for January your birthday is in
[47:01] January yeah you're old
[47:03] though so we going to take that the
[47:06] first church age ended on January 24th
[47:09] see there I said 24th uh 2024 boom and
[47:13] now we've got another Messenger on the
[47:15] scene and he just goes from a baby or he
[47:17] just realizes and he starts preaching
[47:19] that's not the way God is God flows
[47:22] right there's an overlap to each age
[47:24] there's an overlap everything overlap
[47:27] there's a brother Brown called it a lap
[47:28] over but it isn't overlap same thing so
[47:31] one message comes and you still as as
[47:33] brother brandham came there was still
[47:35] old Pentecost that was in his meetings
[47:37] that made it they were born again
[47:39] Christians but did not understand the
[47:41] message of the Hour come on right but
[47:45] God didn't abruptly kill him and throw
[47:46] him away no he come on but there's one
[47:50] time though when he says hey that's
[47:52] enough so something happens that's why
[47:55] 1977 had to happen the way it did right
[47:58] all right because it ushered into a new
[48:02] a jubilee it ushered into a new time a
[48:04] period to where God's not going to wink
[48:06] it at the ignorance of the Pentecostals
[48:09] anymore he's got a bride he's got a
[48:11] mature wife that he's got to start
[48:12] working on all right but there is an
[48:15] Abrupt end to the to the Gentile
[48:17] dispensation because when God's done
[48:19] he's done with it but the church ages is
[48:21] just a flow one right through the other
[48:23] all right so the Son of God is working
[48:25] Son of God is working but right now
[48:27] everything's coming together as the son
[48:30] of man
[48:32] Revelation
[48:33] today not tomorrow
[48:36] today when brother Brown preached those
[48:38] seals that opened the revelation of the
[48:40] son of man it just took us 60 years to
[48:42] realize what it
[48:44] is but you know what God's not up there
[48:49] going he knew exactly before the
[48:52] foundation of the world how long it
[48:53] would take us to get it that's right
[48:56] that's why he that's why he's not
[48:57] nervous sister Rebecca he knows
[48:59] everything right we're all ner I'm
[49:02] nervous about tomorrow cuz I'm worried
[49:04] that y'all done bought a bunch of
[49:05] packages and I got to deliver them all
[49:07] tomorrow but I don't know that till
[49:08] tomorrow till I walk in the door but God
[49:10] knew it before the foundation world so
[49:12] he's not worried about it he knows
[49:13] exactly what's going to happen that's
[49:15] why we put it in his hands and let him
[49:17] take care of it s right then he served
[49:19] his office as a son of man now look he
[49:21] served his office as a son of man
[49:24] dispensation then served his office now
[49:27] as Son of God God is a spirit well now
[49:29] he served through the church ages as the
[49:31] Son of God so where's the church
[49:34] ages ephus smna peram th Sardis
[49:37] Philadelphia and laa and even lapping
[49:39] over into that you and I we're not in an
[49:41] age now we are caught out of that age
[49:44] and we're in the bride age all right now
[49:47] look and now in a millennium though
[49:48] he'll be son of David not son of David
[49:50] now because the sopian woman kept saying
[49:52] son of David Son of David he never even
[49:54] paid her any attention you you think he
[49:55] was
[49:58] rude but he was making a point it was
[50:00] scripture that you and I get to preach
[50:03] on to see that that he knew that he
[50:06] wasn't in that dispensation yet am right
[50:08] so he did not have to brother R said she
[50:11] didn't have any connection to him with a
[50:13] son of David you and I don't either see
[50:16] we can say son of David Son of David and
[50:18] he don't even have to pay attention to
[50:20] us but when you say son of man or Son of
[50:23] God and you say the Lord Jesus and you
[50:25] know he's
[50:26] both right and he's inside of you Amen
[50:31] brother BR said look it's the same man
[50:34] all the
[50:36] time all right so let's go to Revelation
[50:39] 3:20 behold I stand at the door and
[50:41] knock If any man hear my
[50:44] voice this is this is the loudest in
[50:48] church age If any man hear my voice and
[50:51] open the door I will come in to him see
[50:54] it always even open door even if we have
[50:55] to open it right that's a door we have
[50:58] to open that's right all right to let
[51:00] him into our heart but I will come in
[51:02] with you and will s with him and he with
[51:05] me now watch to him that overcometh in
[51:07] other words to him that that has a
[51:10] victory that comes to a position all
[51:13] right will I grant to sit with me in my
[51:17] Throne now look the father's Throne is
[51:21] over here cuz remember he had to
[51:23] overcome to set on the father
[51:26] Throne all right it's not a real throne
[51:30] you don't have a father over here and
[51:31] three you got three Thrones in heaven I
[51:33] think everybody in the Bible knows one
[51:34] thing for sure it says one
[51:37] throne and then there's Thrones in the
[51:39] in the uh at the white Throne judgment
[51:42] we know who that is that's
[51:45] us so he will grant after we overcome
[51:49] this age will I grant to sit with me in
[51:52] my Throne not on in my Throne into
[51:55] intimacy see this is intimacy in the end
[51:58] time it wasn't that way back in the
[52:00] other Church ages and everybody looks at
[52:03] that first part says oh you need isab
[52:05] and you need all this and it's all a
[52:06] bunch of
[52:07] condemnation that right there wasn't
[52:09] given to any other Church AE my
[52:12] friends it wasn't granted the intimacy
[52:14] that we have that we can sit with him in
[52:16] his
[52:17] throne just as he overcome and sat down
[52:20] on his father's Throne which was he
[52:22] conquered death hell and the grave he
[52:26] took that Jehovah God put him in human
[52:29] flesh died for me and you come on
[52:31] somebody and then that's where he
[52:33] ascended and said I'm going to where my
[52:36] father and he's going to be on the right
[52:39] hand of the father remember when Steven
[52:43] was dying he looked up and saw heaven
[52:45] saw Jesus standing on the on the right
[52:47] Throne what right side of the throne or
[52:49] the right arm of the of the father all
[52:51] right it's just a position it's not
[52:54] people same
[52:56] person different
[52:58] dispensation different manifestation we
[53:00] know
[53:01] that but now here's the part that you me
[53:04] and you got to swallow where she is him
[53:06] so we've come to the place now to where
[53:08] all right he's not in a church come on
[53:11] he's not in the
[53:13] church there's some good people in the
[53:16] church if they attach theirself to the
[53:18] church is when they get in trouble right
[53:20] all right if they'll come out of that
[53:22] thing they'll have a chance cuz they
[53:25] didn't say come into her my people it
[53:26] says come out of her my people all
[53:30] right and he being the groom the bride
[53:34] has to come forth because it's part of
[53:36] him and it can only be the manifestation
[53:39] of the fulfilling of all the Revelation
[53:41] look all the revelations any others has
[53:45] spoke of the bride all right it can only
[53:49] manifest if it does something different
[53:51] from the
[53:52] groom it isn't the bride that's right
[53:57] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[54:00] of his bone life of his life power of
[54:02] his power she is him right do we really
[54:08] believe that prophet of God tells us
[54:10] what the Holy Ghost is given for us said
[54:12] look God's purpose we find in sending
[54:14] the Holy Spirit now
[54:17] watch now watch watch how he watch how
[54:19] he words this everybody with me that
[54:21] wake a few minutes I know it's hot up
[54:24] here too God's purpose now look God's
[54:27] purpose so it's not my purpose your
[54:29] purpose it's God's purpose all right
[54:31] God's purpose we find in sending the
[54:34] Holy Spirit you know why he sent the
[54:35] Holy Spirit he's fixing to tell us now
[54:37] remember was one purpose to send the
[54:40] Holy Spirit was one purpose and that was
[54:42] to get a bride under the Son of God
[54:45] manifestation everybody with me on that
[54:48] through the church ages but now watch
[54:51] and continue his plans through the
[54:54] church which now we know as the bride
[54:57] that God was in Christ continuing his
[54:59] plans through Christ now look out of
[55:01] Christ into the
[55:03] church continuing his work through the
[55:06] church all that God was he poured into
[55:08] Christ because he emptied himself and
[55:09] poured it into Christ and Christ was the
[55:11] fullness of the godhe bodily all that
[55:13] Jehovah was he poured into Christ all
[55:15] that Christ was he poured into the
[55:16] church not into one individual as we
[55:19] were talking about Sunday I gave you all
[55:20] those different
[55:22] cups he poured into Christ and all the
[55:24] Crist was he poured into the church not
[55:27] into one individual but into the entire
[55:30] body there's where we come together in
[55:33] unity look we have
[55:36] power
[55:38] amen you can have a wonderful engine and
[55:41] you can have a 8 cylinder 10 cylinder
[55:43] you can have a 50 cylinder but if it's
[55:45] missing a one cylinder brother Donnie
[55:47] what does it do cuts the power right
[55:48] down to nothing almost and you sputter
[55:51] and
[55:52] you foul a plug you know that's not what
[55:55] we're in we're not in a foul and plug
[55:58] era all
[55:59] right we got to have all cylinders
[56:02] firing we got to have all the power we
[56:04] got to have the power same power that
[56:07] when Jesus stood out there one day and
[56:08] he stood in that Garden he said all
[56:10] power in heaven and earth been given
[56:11] unto
[56:13] me now if all power in Heaven and Earth
[56:15] has been given unto him where did he
[56:16] just say he gave it to he poured it into
[56:19] the bride they just not come to the
[56:22] realization and I don't mean that
[56:23] frivolously they didn't come to the real
[56:25] ation like we have that we're
[56:31] him I see denominations pass off the
[56:34] scene everything else going I see God's
[56:38] Great purpose he keeps saying purpose
[56:41] God's Great purpose revealing
[56:43] himself and having first to reveal
[56:46] himself in Christ the fullness of the
[56:48] godhead
[56:48] bodily cuz see look the only way we can
[56:52] understand the father cuz Jesus stood
[56:55] one day and he said You' never seen the
[56:58] father brother Brown stood one time and
[57:00] he said you don't see the real
[57:02] me right but to understand that person
[57:06] we look at the character we look at the
[57:08] character of Jesus Christ we know that
[57:10] who that's who he was he was the
[57:11] fullness of the godhead body because all
[57:13] those virtues worked in his life and he
[57:16] never preached a wrong
[57:22] sermon and look and then to bring that
[57:24] fullness of God had bodly into a
[57:28] people that he can have the preeminence
[57:31] you know what preeminence is
[57:34] pre he can have he can have the power
[57:37] over you before anything begins he has
[57:40] the preeminence pre over what you're
[57:44] doing boy we're missing it aren't
[57:47] we cuz you know there's a pre and a post
[57:50] there's a pregame show and a postgame
[57:51] show postgame show is when it's over
[57:53] with we're actually over here in the
[57:54] post game game show you know we're over
[57:56] here going uh what no he already wants
[58:00] the preeminence so when you give him the
[58:02] first when you give him the first
[58:04] control you don't have to worry about
[58:06] what's going to happen at the
[58:07] end the problem is is we take self-will
[58:10] on this side and not preeminence on that
[58:13] through the through the Journey right
[58:15] well that's my problem I don't know if
[58:16] it's
[58:17] yours that he can have the prence the
[58:20] oversight the leading now watch Christ
[58:22] The Mystery of God reveal now the
[58:24] complete fullness of the godhead bily
[58:26] dwells in his church the
[58:28] pinenes all that God was importing to
[58:30] Christ Christ was importing to the
[58:31] church look the
[58:34] Believers not the church the
[58:36] Believers then he comes and calls us
[58:39] bride after the seals break he called us
[58:42] bride one more thing is God in men the
[58:45] fullness of God in the godhead by L his
[58:47] entire church manifesting
[58:49] himself fulfilling his word now we find
[58:52] God all ages has had skin on it all
[58:55] right so God has had skin on it the
[58:57] whole
[58:57] time but he God has been hid behind the
[59:00] veil but what's happened false Doctrine
[59:04] has kept him from coming on the scene
[59:06] like he wanted to be right right
[59:09] Ephesians 4:14 that we henceforth be no
[59:11] more children tossed to and fro and
[59:13] carried away with every wind of Doctrine
[59:15] by the slot of men and cunning
[59:17] craftiness whereby they lying weight to
[59:18] deceive but speaking the
[59:22] truth in love
[59:25] now what happens when you speak the
[59:27] truth in love you grow
[59:30] up may grow up into him look in all
[59:34] things which is the head even
[59:38] Christ remember I told yall the other
[59:40] day false Doctrine hinders the Holy
[59:42] Spirit you believe that listen to this
[59:45] listen to what Jesus had to do Luke
[59:48] 8:52 and all wept and bewailed her but
[59:51] he said weep not remember Jar's daughter
[59:53] I believe it was she is not dead but
[59:56] sleepeth and they laugh now this is God
[59:59] this is the fullness of the godhead
[1:00:01] bodily all right and I didn't find the
[1:00:04] quote but I'll find it later where
[1:00:05] brother Brown says he had had to put
[1:00:06] them out of the room because their
[1:00:08] unbelief cuz watch this they laughed in
[1:00:10] with scorn knowing that she was dead and
[1:00:12] he put them all out he put them out of
[1:00:15] the
[1:00:16] room and took that lady by the hand and
[1:00:18] said made
[1:00:20] arise so what hindered him all the
[1:00:22] unbelief around him is what hindered him
[1:00:24] remember he tells about going in the
[1:00:26] city and he had to leave the city
[1:00:27] because of their
[1:00:28] unbelief Ephesians 4:30 says and grieve
[1:00:32] not that word grieve is to make
[1:00:34] sorrowful to affect with sadness I want
[1:00:36] you to look
[1:00:38] offend to make the Holy Spirit
[1:00:43] uneasy and grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:00:46] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[1:00:48] of redemption and offend not the holy
[1:00:51] spirit of God Amen and to make the the
[1:00:54] Holy Spirit
[1:00:56] uneasy yeah we can do that cuz we're
[1:00:59] still
[1:01:00] humans and he knows that and he's made
[1:01:03] provision so now let's talk about the
[1:01:05] pyramid just for a
[1:01:08] second it never was put on top of the
[1:01:10] pyramid why because when he said he was
[1:01:13] rejected and he said I go away and I'm
[1:01:15] going to send the comforter the
[1:01:17] headstone went away God in human flesh
[1:01:19] went out went over in another dimension
[1:01:22] but to build this Monument to build
[1:01:25] stature it starts out with the
[1:01:27] foundation stone of faith and then he
[1:01:28] continues on with all the virtues and he
[1:01:31] controls in the strength of every one of
[1:01:33] these things right in here I see I got
[1:01:36] in between all these Works in here
[1:01:38] little waves now the original pictures
[1:01:39] like I said before I'm going to try to
[1:01:41] find it because I know Daddy's got it
[1:01:42] somewhere he's got waves coming like
[1:01:44] this on the
[1:01:46] chart so that what's that wave doing
[1:01:48] it's it's
[1:01:52] coming this is what what we've been
[1:01:54] waiting
[1:01:56] on that's right is the
[1:02:00] wave we've been waiting on that wave of
[1:02:02] the Holy Ghost to seal us all in you
[1:02:04] said no I'm sealed yeah in your soul you
[1:02:07] are but not in your spirit right
[1:02:10] definitely not in your
[1:02:12] flesh but he we're waiting on that
[1:02:14] little wave that little thing to put
[1:02:16] everything together now watch he says
[1:02:17] look the holy ghost coming down now
[1:02:20] remember you already got the holy ghost
[1:02:21] in your soul so you don't have to come
[1:02:23] down somewhere to get in your soul if
[1:02:25] you're already if he's already in there
[1:02:27] everybody with me so he's bringing an
[1:02:29] anointing of the Holy Ghost this is not
[1:02:31] a new birth this is not an a different
[1:02:33] New Birth than you got to begin with
[1:02:35] this is an anointing This Is A
[1:02:38] dispensational change is everybody with
[1:02:40] me cuz your church ages are over the
[1:02:43] dispensation lay out to
[1:02:45] seea it's a dispensation change to where
[1:02:48] God's only talking to his wife right
[1:02:51] come on on right come cuz remember the
[1:02:55] wife is the only one that's going to
[1:02:56] understand what the groom says right all
[1:02:59] what the groom
[1:03:01] says holy spirit the holy spirit is
[1:03:03] above all this welding This Together
[1:03:05] building a
[1:03:08] perfect say that
[1:03:13] word perfect
[1:03:15] what
[1:03:17] church for the Capstone to cap it
[1:03:21] off well you know what people say they
[1:03:24] ain't no perfect church and if you go
[1:03:25] find one the first time you step in it
[1:03:27] it's all it's not it's not perfect
[1:03:35] anymore I said
[1:03:40] that but he said a perfect
[1:03:42] church not perfect in that everybody
[1:03:45] agrees 100% with the color of the walls
[1:03:49] you know but you better agree in
[1:03:52] Doctrine you better not have your own
[1:03:54] own
[1:03:55] idea cuz your own idea that don't even
[1:03:59] sound right to God your own idea I
[1:04:01] thought we had to get rid of them and
[1:04:02] get his idea all right and he's not he
[1:04:05] don't have
[1:04:06] ideas he has
[1:04:11] truth now look what happens next then
[1:04:13] comes the Pentecostal the baptism of the
[1:04:15] Holy Ghost still the church got smaller
[1:04:16] in the minority and now it goes on till
[1:04:19] that has to get to such a perfect place
[1:04:21] he keeps saying the word perfect until
[1:04:24] when that headstone finally comes now
[1:04:26] watch it'll fit so
[1:04:28] perfect the church will be have to be in
[1:04:31] such a perfect shade here said it three
[1:04:33] times in two sentences plus the other
[1:04:37] quote before until when Christ comes he
[1:04:40] fits right into
[1:04:42] it so you see just speaking in tongues
[1:04:45] dancing in the spirit that's way down
[1:04:47] the line here
[1:04:48] yet and remember if you was ever there
[1:04:50] in Egypt the spank talking about the
[1:04:52] stones you put a razor blade between
[1:04:53] them hone to a perfect condition till it
[1:04:56] fits perfect that's the way the church
[1:04:58] is going to have to
[1:05:01] be so hone down the word honing the
[1:05:05] church until when Christ comes to take
[1:05:07] the church the ministry the church will
[1:05:10] pick right up on it and raise Luther
[1:05:13] Wesley Pentecost and all and go up with
[1:05:16] that with it to take the church up
[1:05:21] Ephesians 4:15 but speaking the truth
[1:05:23] and love make grow up into him in all
[1:05:25] things we just read this a minute ago
[1:05:27] which is thee even Christ so let's
[1:05:29] continue though from whom the whole body
[1:05:31] fitly joined together there's that fit
[1:05:33] part again fitly joined together and
[1:05:36] compacted brother George compacted that
[1:05:40] means you as we were just in Gainesville
[1:05:43] just a little while ago before dark they
[1:05:45] was out there working on a on a line
[1:05:47] some kind of water line or something and
[1:05:48] they had one of them compactors that guy
[1:05:50] was going toop up it
[1:05:51] going well what was he doing he was
[1:05:53] compact in that soil down to where you
[1:05:56] know if you just throw dirt in it and
[1:05:59] two days later or two weeks later it
[1:06:01] started raining you're going to have a
[1:06:02] what you going to have a hole but he's
[1:06:05] compacting it down to where nothing else
[1:06:07] can get in there and that's what God's
[1:06:08] doing to us amen he's he's cinching up
[1:06:11] all the holes that's what the holy
[1:06:13] spirit is doing when he comes down and
[1:06:14] it's going to it's going to just bathe
[1:06:16] us
[1:06:18] amen you going to have problems sure
[1:06:21] going to have trials
[1:06:23] sure but you can know how to handle
[1:06:26] them and I've always said the Holy
[1:06:29] Spirit doesn't take away your problems
[1:06:31] right but it teaches you how to handle
[1:06:33] them right and you know what it does too
[1:06:36] it shortens them yes if you'll let the
[1:06:39] Holy Spirit if you'll let him lead it
[1:06:41] will shorten your
[1:06:42] problem I was talking to a girl today at
[1:06:47] work um her sister had a son died and
[1:06:51] it's been a long time ago and there some
[1:06:54] point in time where you know you you if
[1:06:57] you're a born again Christian you got to
[1:06:59] say that had to be God that did that he
[1:07:02] knew what was right he knew every part
[1:07:04] of that was right he knew why he was
[1:07:07] taking that young man he knew all that
[1:07:09] just leave it to him and leave it alone
[1:07:12] and let your trial be this short not a
[1:07:15] lifetime long some people can't let go
[1:07:17] of a lifetime of stuff right come on we
[1:07:20] know those people but they're not true
[1:07:22] Born Again Christians I'm promising you
[1:07:24] you there's somewhere you got to lay it
[1:07:25] down and say God that's
[1:07:27] yours I believe you're perfect I believe
[1:07:30] I'm your child I believe it had to be
[1:07:32] for the best I believe this is the only
[1:07:34] way it could happen that's right exactly
[1:07:37] if not God would have done it a
[1:07:38] different way CU remember God's the only
[1:07:41] one who can take you they me and sister
[1:07:43] Anna Canard was talking about you know
[1:07:44] you can shorten your life you can go
[1:07:45] walk out and stand in the in the middle
[1:07:48] of the road brother John and few minutes
[1:07:50] later we'll hear this crash
[1:07:52] and somebody down one1 but but you're
[1:07:56] not going till God tells you you're
[1:07:58] going so when he takes
[1:08:00] you that's perfect that's right do we
[1:08:04] really believe that that's right you
[1:08:08] know the old saying is you know he went
[1:08:10] before his time no he didn't go before
[1:08:13] his time there was only one problem with
[1:08:15] a man in the in the Bible in the Old
[1:08:17] Testament they wanted to lengthen his
[1:08:19] life and you see what that got him right
[1:08:22] he should have went when God said it's
[1:08:23] time for you to go right so let's just
[1:08:26] let but but to me that satisfies
[1:08:29] anything inside of us it just keeps
[1:08:31] something lingering and eating at you
[1:08:33] and and let that thing go there's not
[1:08:37] one more thing you can do about it and
[1:08:38] like I said before if we know God's
[1:08:40] perfect we know he don't make a mistake
[1:08:42] we know he does everything for our good
[1:08:45] that's what he said right and he'll
[1:08:47] never put on you more than you can stand
[1:08:49] that's right am I reading scripture he's
[1:08:51] telling that directly to his bride if
[1:08:54] something happens in our life we just
[1:08:56] say though God slay
[1:08:59] me yet I'll trust him like brother Brown
[1:09:03] said he
[1:09:04] said whatever
[1:09:06] Lord my kids's dying my wife's
[1:09:10] dead the Lord give us the Lord take us
[1:09:15] away blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:19] amen this I say before therefore and
[1:09:22] testifying the Lord that you henceforth
[1:09:24] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:09:26] vanity of their mind having their un the
[1:09:29] understanding darkened being alienated
[1:09:31] from the life of God through the
[1:09:33] ignorance now look through the ignorance
[1:09:35] that's in
[1:09:38] them stop theirself from going on with
[1:09:41] God by the ignorance that's inside of
[1:09:44] us because of the
[1:09:46] blindness of their heart now look
[1:09:49] brother Mar look these fellas wasn't
[1:09:51] required what these Fells are
[1:09:52] dispensation this wasn't required what
[1:09:55] this was now I do believe and you and I
[1:09:57] we all know and believe that that every
[1:10:00] promise and every um and every woe in
[1:10:04] other words you might say another
[1:10:06] another one 2 3 4 5 seven Church ages we
[1:10:10] get their blessings but we also get
[1:10:12] their curse but we're the Life Church
[1:10:14] age we're over here at the very end all
[1:10:16] right and you still hadn't done away
[1:10:19] because over way over here in the first
[1:10:21] church age he said you've left your
[1:10:22] first love well that's the same away
[1:10:23] with today oh yeah sure
[1:10:25] right right then he says you got a name
[1:10:29] you call but you're dead then all these
[1:10:31] different things well well that didn't
[1:10:33] go away in that church age right it just
[1:10:35] kept flowing through to here so
[1:10:37] everything's piling up here that's right
[1:10:40] even brother R said in the Dark Ages The
[1:10:43] Same Spirit that o spirit for them to
[1:10:45] overcome and to just walk into a lion's
[1:10:48] den and walk into a a gladiator's uh
[1:10:52] ring and give their life for God he said
[1:10:55] you need that every day to get through
[1:10:58] your life well yes yeah you
[1:11:02] do how many lines is out there ready to
[1:11:04] kill you
[1:11:05] now the Holy Ghost Christ in the person
[1:11:08] of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the
[1:11:10] true see now he's back to that word true
[1:11:12] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:15] now remember that word true the real
[1:11:17] nature corresponding to the name in
[1:11:19] other words what I'm trying to get you
[1:11:20] to see dispensational changes amen
[1:11:24] that's right dispensations must
[1:11:26] correspond with the real genuine that's
[1:11:29] going on in that period of time right
[1:11:32] with me yes I I'm not looking for Jesus
[1:11:36] to Walk on the shores of Galilee again
[1:11:38] right right in this in this
[1:11:41] dispensation I want him to see him in
[1:11:44] yours walking your feet that's our
[1:11:47] dispensation there was a dispensation
[1:11:49] when yes sir he walked on the face of
[1:11:50] the Earth and he walked in uh Sho
[1:11:53] leather
[1:11:54] he ate he lived with a group of people
[1:11:57] but now that's not that dispensation
[1:11:59] anymore this dispensation is he's alive
[1:12:02] in you and me the same way without
[1:12:05] restrictions come on he has been under
[1:12:07] restrictions during these other
[1:12:12] dispensations right right this is the
[1:12:15] dispensation of the son of man
[1:12:20] amen then you get all these virtues
[1:12:22] sealed in you then God lives in a
[1:12:24] tabernacle called the building the
[1:12:26] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:12:29] Dwelling Place when a man possesses
[1:12:32] these kind of things look then the Holy
[1:12:34] Ghost comes upon
[1:12:36] him now many people in the message take
[1:12:39] that quote right there and they believe
[1:12:40] that you don't get the baptism of the
[1:12:42] Holy Ghost until you all the way up here
[1:12:44] where it says holy spirit I I I
[1:12:47] personally listen to them talk about it
[1:12:49] just because of this
[1:12:50] quote says when a man possesses these
[1:12:53] kind of things the virtues then the Holy
[1:12:55] Spirit comes look it doesn't come in him
[1:12:57] it comes upon you I look at words right
[1:13:01] in and
[1:13:03] on Lord's Prayer says in Earth not on
[1:13:06] Earth that's right in Earth as it is in
[1:13:09] heaven in Earth Glory this Earth I'm not
[1:13:13] worried about I listen if this Earth
[1:13:15] don't get changed this one surely will
[1:13:16] not right exactly so the whole world's
[1:13:19] waiting groaning as I said before
[1:13:22] waiting on the manifestation of the sons
[1:13:23] of God not manifestation of
[1:13:26] trees they'll change when we change
[1:13:29] amen cuz they got lost when we got lost
[1:13:34] right then the Holy Ghost comes upon him
[1:13:37] no matter you might speak in tongues you
[1:13:38] might impersonate any gift look that
[1:13:40] God's got but until these virtues here
[1:13:43] go into you now they Ed the word into
[1:13:46] brother George you're still off the real
[1:13:48] true there's that true again True
[1:13:51] Foundation of faith but when these
[1:13:54] virtues grow
[1:13:56] in and you added that to that then you
[1:14:00] are a living Monument you're a living
[1:14:02] moving Idol greatest battle ever fought
[1:14:05] brother Ram says look open up them flu
[1:14:07] of the soul and body senses conscious
[1:14:09] that's that's the spirit realm and just
[1:14:12] let God's word penetrate first right
[1:14:15] preeminence
[1:14:18] pre let God's word penetrate first take
[1:14:21] that mind that's why I said every listen
[1:14:23] everything's got an order we know that
[1:14:25] right that's why we have church order
[1:14:28] all right that's why I said about coming
[1:14:30] in here late for church you comeing here
[1:14:31] late for church you got everything on
[1:14:33] your mind that's
[1:14:35] right if you'll settle down for about 20
[1:14:38] minutes and just pray read your Bible
[1:14:40] listen to what brother rown says but you
[1:14:42] come walking in here 10 minutes after
[1:14:44] Bob's been
[1:14:46] speaking
[1:14:49] no you ain't going to get nothing you've
[1:14:52] lost 10 minutes of an ET Eternal speech
[1:14:55] right
[1:14:56] exactly oh that's too much I thought the
[1:14:59] word was eternal and if somebody brought
[1:15:00] it and made it Eternal
[1:15:03] too but there's your
[1:15:07] Battleground open up that mind that's
[1:15:10] the Battleground that's where the battle
[1:15:11] sets in Array right here in the front
[1:15:13] line your mind that's why I told about
[1:15:15] brother Ryan saying that the devil set
[1:15:17] on his shoulder I wished he was sitting
[1:15:19] right
[1:15:20] there I could flick him off
[1:15:23] but he's right here and I something I
[1:15:26] can't knock it out yet I'm sorry I have
[1:15:30] that problem if y'all don't have that
[1:15:31] problem pray for
[1:15:33] me right here the front line is your
[1:15:38] mind open it up look every doubt I doubt
[1:15:42] my doubts one more time every
[1:15:45] doubt I doubt my
[1:15:48] doubts so every doubt he
[1:15:51] has he doubts that doubt that he
[1:15:55] had do we do that no you know what we do
[1:15:58] we keep piling
[1:16:00] up doubt and fear goes together you know
[1:16:03] that right I'm believing God's word here
[1:16:07] I come Satan something is going to take
[1:16:09] place sure it will yes
[1:16:12] sir now we looked at this in the
[1:16:15] interval would just 8:30 will I tell you
[1:16:18] what let's stop magicians come
[1:16:22] on but I want to read what brother R
[1:16:24] said about the interval and then we'll
[1:16:25] get we'll start on it maybe Sunday for a
[1:16:27] little bit Brother D you don't be doing
[1:16:29] that we'll be okay people oh need
[1:16:31] they're already asleep now so I'm just
[1:16:32] going to let them get
[1:16:33] home now we
[1:16:35] know that's
[1:16:37] okay I know we're
[1:16:41] human but we notice this interval now
[1:16:44] between the sixth and seventh chapter
[1:16:46] now the seventh chapter of Revelation
[1:16:48] look reveals a happening now remember
[1:16:51] Revelation chapter 6 is Seal 1 through
[1:16:54] six right Revelation 7 is not the
[1:16:57] revelation of a
[1:16:58] seal it's the bringing in the
[1:17:01] 144,000 then the seventh seal takes up
[1:17:04] in Revelations 8 everybody with me now
[1:17:07] look we notice this interval now between
[1:17:10] the sixth and seventh chapter now the
[1:17:11] seventh chapter of Revelation reveals a
[1:17:17] happening it's not in here just for
[1:17:21] nothing it's not put in between this for
[1:17:25] nothing right it is here for a purpose
[1:17:29] right and it's a revelation that reveals
[1:17:33] something we'll keep getting into that a
[1:17:35] little bit more notice how mysterious
[1:17:38] and mathematical it fits right in the
[1:17:39] scripture exactly you believe in God's
[1:17:42] mathematics if you don't you're sure
[1:17:44] lost in the you'll sure get lost in the
[1:17:46] word if you start putting a four or six
[1:17:48] or something besides just the
[1:17:50] mathematical words running in order
[1:17:52] you'll sure have
[1:17:53] in your scene a cow picking grass in the
[1:17:55] top of a tree somewhere you certainly
[1:17:58] run out because God does not his whole
[1:18:00] word does not run look it it run
[1:18:03] completely in mathematics it doesn't run
[1:18:05] completely and he say in in mathematics
[1:18:07] perfect the most perfect there's no
[1:18:08] other literature written like it so
[1:18:11] perfect in mathematics and that's that
[1:18:14] interval that we've been talking about
[1:18:17] Matthew
[1:18:18] 24:4 he preach six seal go to Matthew
[1:18:21] 24:32
[1:18:23] it stops and there's an interval there's
[1:18:25] a calling in of some of of a group of
[1:18:27] people but we're going to look at that
[1:18:28] in a spiritual sense a little bit a
[1:18:30] little bit later then Matthew 24:36 to
[1:18:33] 44 picks right up with the seventh seal
[1:18:36] and he talks about the son of
[1:18:38] man then you look at what brother rown
[1:18:40] said look The Sixth Seal produce itself
[1:18:42] seventh seal brings him back to Earth
[1:18:44] and we'll talk about that a little bit
[1:18:45] but there had to be that interval and
[1:18:47] when we get into the seals which we're
[1:18:48] going to get started in the seals
[1:18:49] because you have to preach the seals if
[1:18:51] you preach the son of man
[1:18:53] y because he is the seal and everything
[1:18:55] about him was the Seals All right so you
[1:18:57] got to preach on them so we're going to
[1:18:59] preach on them again for the second or
[1:19:01] third
[1:19:02] time but we're going to maybe approach
[1:19:05] it at a little bit different angle if
[1:19:07] that's all
[1:19:08] right but remember Noah was in the ark
[1:19:11] the bride is sealed in with Christ the
[1:19:12] last member has been redeemed The Sixth
[1:19:14] Seal has produced itself the seventh
[1:19:16] seal brings him to Earth the lamb come
[1:19:18] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:19:20] and sat down as in Revelations 5
[1:19:23] Revelations
[1:19:25] 5 claimed what he owned what he had
[1:19:28] redeemed that's right it's always been
[1:19:30] that third pull three is perfection now
[1:19:32] for some of you young ones that don't
[1:19:33] know what third pull is we'll cover that
[1:19:35] too cuz that's in the son of man
[1:19:36] Revelation all
[1:19:38] right there was no such thing as three
[1:19:40] pulls in the in the first age second age
[1:19:43] third age fourth age fifth age this is
[1:19:45] all something that come out of all those
[1:19:47] ages that's right and it was specific to
[1:19:49] brother brandham but he gave it to us
[1:19:52] all right
[1:19:53] CU
[1:19:54] remember the third pool are the totally
[1:19:57] lost the bride and the church the
[1:20:01] ministry comes to its Perfection What
[1:20:03] when the third pole happens when that
[1:20:05] thing comes to The
[1:20:07] Headstone we come to Perfection when
[1:20:09] it's when it reproduced Christ again in
[1:20:12] natural look in natural amongst human
[1:20:16] beings as was predicted as it was in the
[1:20:19] days of light let's stand at our feet
[1:20:24] just think on these things brother Dell
[1:20:26] always said think on these things think
[1:20:28] of all these intervals that we're
[1:20:29] looking at in in the um in the Bible and
[1:20:34] then even with brother brandom preaching
[1:20:36] six seals and having questions and
[1:20:38] answers and then seventh seal and then
[1:20:40] he preached six Church ages and had 10
[1:20:43] preached 10 virgins and 144,000 kind of
[1:20:45] strange and then he had preached on the
[1:20:47] seven Church a so there's always that so
[1:20:50] there's something in there we'll talk
[1:20:51] about a little bit later I wanted to
[1:20:52] develop in your mind not to just say
[1:20:54] well I don't I don't know why that's in
[1:20:56] there but it's in there no I want us to
[1:20:57] see why it was in there see why all that
[1:21:00] was you got six and then all of a
[1:21:03] sudden stop for a minute then you got to
[1:21:06] go to the seventh seal and it'll produce
[1:21:09] itself it will produce itself because
[1:21:11] that is God in human flesh he preached
[1:21:16] them he was in human flesh okay and I
[1:21:20] believe he was in a little Prophet one
[1:21:21] night during the week and he preached
[1:21:24] those seals through a human
[1:21:27] being and nobody understood
[1:21:30] it I read you the quote he told the
[1:21:33] people you ain't getting it it ain't for
[1:21:36] you well if it wasn't for you I thought
[1:21:39] the Bible I mean I thought the Bible
[1:21:40] told us that you don't cast you you know
[1:21:42] if you cast your word out it's not going
[1:21:43] to return void it's going to
[1:21:45] accomplish what it said it would
[1:21:47] accomplish so I believe it's
[1:21:49] accomplishing now what it was meant to
[1:21:51] be I believe it is now accomplishing
[1:21:54] what it meant to be and people are
[1:21:56] getting it I believe people are getting
[1:21:59] it let's sing a song If you have a need
