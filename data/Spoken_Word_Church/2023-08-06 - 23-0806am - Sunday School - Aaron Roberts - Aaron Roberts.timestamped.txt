[3:36] technologically advanced like the rest
[3:38] of them but uh
[3:39] uh
[3:41] we're gonna we're gonna get all the bugs
[3:42] worked out one of these days so
[3:45] uh there's more now on a look at a
[3:48] little fault here
[3:51] and uh I want to read Romans chapter 1
[3:54] verses 16 and 17 and then Matthew
[3:56] chapter 15.
[4:00] and Romans 1 16 17 very familiar
[4:03] scripture says for I'm not ashamed of
[4:06] the gospel of Christ for it is the power
[4:09] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[4:11] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[4:14] the Greek
[4:16] he said for therein is the righteousness
[4:18] of God revealed from Faith to Faith as
[4:21] it is written the just shall live by
[4:23] faith
[4:26] and Matthew chapter 15 beginning at
[4:29] verse 1.
[4:30] says then came to Jesus scribes and
[4:33] Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying
[4:36] why do thy disciples transgress the
[4:38] trans the tradition of the elders for
[4:42] they wash not their hands when they eat
[4:44] bread
[4:45] but he answered and said unto them why
[4:48] do ye also transgress the Commandment of
[4:50] God by your tradition
[4:54] for God commanded saying honor thy
[4:56] father and mother and he he that curseth
[4:58] father or mother let him die of the
[5:00] death
[5:02] but ye say whosoever shall say to his
[5:05] father and or his mother it is a gift
[5:08] by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
[5:11] by me and honored not his father or his
[5:15] mother he shall be free thus have you
[5:17] made the Commandment of God of none
[5:19] effect by your tradition
[5:22] he Hypocrites welded Isaiah prophesy of
[5:25] you saying this people draweth nigh unto
[5:28] me with their mouth and honoreth me with
[5:30] their lips but their heart is far from
[5:32] me but in vain do they worship me
[5:34] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[5:37] of men
[5:38] and that's one thing I want to look at
[5:40] uh
[5:42] the doctrines
[5:45] because we have
[5:48] you can have the doctrines
[5:50] or is it following the Commandments of
[5:53] men and
[5:55] one of the things that I was I was
[5:57] looking at some things and then I was
[5:59] thinking about was in Bible Study last
[6:01] night
[6:03] and you know
[6:04] you can have the word
[6:07] and one of the questions was asked about
[6:09] uh
[6:11] revelation
[6:13] I said can you get a revelation without
[6:15] being born again
[6:18] well I've always said
[6:21] when God begins to deal with you
[6:24] justification is a revelation
[6:26] when he brings you to the place of you
[6:28] understand because you've got to see
[6:30] that you're Justified
[6:33] you've got to come to a place to realize
[6:35] that you're lost
[6:38] and you need a savior
[6:40] amen
[6:41] that's a revelation God shows you who
[6:43] you are
[6:46] because when you realize I'm in this
[6:49] place
[6:50] and there's a Chasm between me and God
[6:54] and there's only one that's going to
[6:56] bridge that Chasm and that's Jesus
[6:58] Christ
[7:00] and he's offering you
[7:03] the gift a free gift of salvation
[7:06] for you to come
[7:08] into fellowship with him he wants to
[7:10] bring you into this place when you see
[7:12] that that's the Revelation and as
[7:14] brother Wade was speaking you know when
[7:16] you see that the Revelation when God
[7:19] begins to deal with you that
[7:22] that revelation
[7:25] then you can't stay in the same place
[7:27] that you were before
[7:30] because that Revelation is to bring you
[7:33] to a closer step
[7:36] so when you come into justification then
[7:39] the Lord begins when you step into that
[7:42] what's in in Acts 2 when he's when he
[7:45] says to repent and be baptized what is
[7:48] what does repent mean
[7:50] it means to turn from your old ways
[7:54] so when you turn from the old your old
[7:57] ways
[7:58] now that doesn't that doesn't mean that
[8:00] you're not going to fall that doesn't
[8:01] mean you're not going to fail it doesn't
[8:03] mean you're not going to have problems
[8:04] but you know what you make a conscious
[8:07] effort to turn away from the old things
[8:10] you you know when you get to that place
[8:13] the Lord has to do a work in your life
[8:16] but there's something that we do
[8:18] you know you can't be around the same
[8:21] people that you were around before you
[8:23] have to make a conscious effort to
[8:26] change who you are
[8:28] you know you know one of my one of my
[8:30] favorite loves and and one of the things
[8:33] that I I was absorbed with
[8:36] I mean absolutely absorbed with was
[8:37] country music
[8:40] ask Janine asked Richard I was I was I
[8:43] mean you you asked me I knew all about
[8:46] it I know I knew songwriters I know I
[8:49] know singers anybody that wanted
[8:52] different Awards over the years I knew
[8:54] them I knew all kinds of people I was
[8:56] like a walking encyclopedia I just
[8:58] absorbed everything
[9:00] because it was just something I love I
[9:03] just I played it all the time
[9:06] but you know when the Lord began to deal
[9:08] with me and the Lord saved me you know I
[9:10] had to I had to turn all that away
[9:14] and you know what when I give my heart
[9:16] to the Lord you know what the love of
[9:17] country music didn't leave
[9:20] you know what it took it took some
[9:22] sanctification to get there
[9:25] but you know it was it was a process but
[9:27] you know what I sold all my CDs
[9:30] I got rid of all my stuff all because I
[9:32] had to make a conscious effort to stay
[9:34] away from that
[9:35] and so when you get to that point you've
[9:37] got to set all that aside yes and so
[9:39] then you start trying to make that
[9:41] conscious effort but you know the desire
[9:43] had to leave
[9:44] and it's just like smoking
[9:48] and you know those different things
[9:49] you've got to try to put that away yeah
[9:52] man I'm going to step away from that but
[9:55] you know you've got but the Lord has to
[9:56] do the sanctification
[9:59] and just like the sister that brother
[10:01] Branham was talking about you know you
[10:04] can't go and and Witness
[10:06] to those people as she did in the dance
[10:09] hall and said well I'm so I'm I'm so
[10:12] delivered from that we'll come to find
[10:14] out she realized she wasn't delivered
[10:16] from that
[10:17] because when she got back into that
[10:19] atmosphere it drew her right back in
[10:23] and she was right back out on the Dance
[10:25] Floor
[10:26] and so it's the same way when you when
[10:28] you receive that revelation God is
[10:31] bringing you to a closer walk but you
[10:34] know we've got to put some effort into
[10:35] it ourselves and that doesn't mean when
[10:37] you when you fall and when you fail you
[10:39] know what the grace of God is still
[10:40] there to cover you and you know what you
[10:43] just pick up and you just keep going
[10:46] you know and so you just you just keep
[10:49] going forward I I fall I fail
[10:53] but you know what I if I can't look at
[10:55] myself
[10:58] you can't look at yourself
[11:01] because you know what we can confess our
[11:03] faults and he is faithful and just to
[11:05] forgive us and cleanse us from all
[11:08] unrighteousness is what the scripture
[11:09] tells us
[11:10] then you know what we just go before the
[11:12] Lord and you know you know what I'm not
[11:14] I can't do this but you know I'm gonna
[11:16] put some effort into it amen I'm gonna
[11:18] pray
[11:20] and you know what and everything's gonna
[11:21] get in your way and I'm going to pray
[11:23] and I'm gonna read my Bible
[11:26] but you know what you've got you've got
[11:28] to press into that
[11:29] and you know what the devil's going to
[11:31] be there right but right beside you
[11:32] right in front of you he's going to
[11:33] handle you all the way but you know what
[11:35] you just got to keep fighting him you
[11:37] got to keep pressing that battle
[11:40] and you know as you stay in the word
[11:41] through the word comes sanctification
[11:45] because as you feed on the word the Holy
[11:49] Ghost is in it and see that's another
[11:51] Revelation that comes
[11:53] because he begins to reveal to you
[11:55] you'll start to see the unclean Spirit
[11:58] go out
[11:59] you'll start to see those things that
[12:01] you battled that you know I can't
[12:03] overcome these things
[12:06] and brother Donnie would tell you
[12:09] we stepped down at the shop
[12:12] years ago
[12:15] and he was and you know he kept telling
[12:16] me I can't give up cigarettes
[12:20] but you know I told him I said I told
[12:21] him exactly what he needed to do
[12:23] right just keep on going
[12:27] I said when you get sick when you get
[12:29] down to business with God God will get
[12:31] down to business with you
[12:33] that's right and when you get to that
[12:35] place where you like you said when you
[12:36] get tired of being sick and tired and
[12:38] you want to get rid of that thing and
[12:40] you you get before God and you get get
[12:42] serious with God God will come on the
[12:45] scene
[12:46] but sometimes we're just
[12:48] kind of like this scripture here
[12:52] and you know one of the reasons why I
[12:55] want to read this scripture is because
[12:57] you know Jesus said
[13:00] they they took the doctrines and the
[13:04] made the they made they caught the for
[13:06] the doctrines the Commandments of men
[13:10] and you know he was talking about by
[13:12] your Traditions you've made the word of
[13:14] God of none effect
[13:18] and one of the one of the definitions of
[13:21] tradition
[13:23] is an is an ordinance it's like a law
[13:26] but one of the definitions that I found
[13:28] I thought was really interesting
[13:31] it means giving up
[13:33] giving over
[13:35] the act of giving up
[13:37] as in
[13:39] the surrender of cities
[13:43] and I thought that was really
[13:46] interesting when I was reading that was
[13:47] what caught my attention is when you
[13:49] look at that
[13:50] when when the Lord has brought you to a
[13:54] place and the word has come to you
[13:57] and just like they did
[14:00] those Pharisees and the Sadducees they
[14:03] took the word that they had heard
[14:06] and it was tradition to them it wasn't
[14:08] in the law
[14:11] they had read into that
[14:13] and they had made their own rules
[14:16] their own traditions
[14:18] and because of that they put that on
[14:21] equal billing
[14:23] with the law of Moses
[14:26] and so they equaled these and Had Each
[14:29] one had to have the same reverence so
[14:31] when they saw the disciples come by and
[14:34] they didn't wash their hands and they
[14:35] didn't wash pots and they didn't do
[14:37] certain things
[14:39] they were highly upset with those
[14:40] disciples and they come to Jesus why do
[14:42] they do that
[14:45] and he was like well why is it that
[14:47] y'all don't follow
[14:48] the word
[14:50] when the when the and because they had
[14:53] got to this place of looking at
[14:55] everything a certain way
[14:58] they
[14:59] had
[15:00] lost the reverence for the for the for
[15:03] the word
[15:06] and many times in our lives we can do
[15:09] the exact same thing in the fact that if
[15:11] we allow it's like well I yes
[15:15] you can overcome
[15:17] but if we allow the devil
[15:20] to put in our mind we can't overcome
[15:22] you can't be healed
[15:25] you can't be delivered
[15:28] you've always battled this and you'll
[15:30] always battle this
[15:34] you know
[15:35] your grandparents had diabetes
[15:38] your parents had diabetes
[15:40] and they say you've got diabetes
[15:43] well you know what the diabetes devil
[15:45] can get off
[15:46] yeah
[15:49] because the word of God Says by his
[15:52] stripes we were healed
[15:55] and so just because it come down through
[15:58] my genealogy the physical genealogy
[16:00] doesn't mean that I'm accepting those
[16:02] rattlesnakes and just because brother
[16:05] Brown said you know we all have tempers
[16:07] well you know what hey we still battling
[16:11] this flesh but you know what we don't
[16:13] have to battle him forever
[16:16] why because there's Deliverance
[16:20] but by the word by the word that has
[16:23] come we have received
[16:25] deliverance and we just continue to walk
[16:29] in that justification was a revelation
[16:31] Saints vacations of Revelation
[16:34] the baptism the new birth is a
[16:36] revelation
[16:37] and then we know that coming up through
[16:39] the stature of a perfect man every one
[16:42] of those is a revelation it's a
[16:43] continuation but you know what it's the
[16:45] same Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost starts
[16:48] you on your journey and you start going
[16:50] in every step of the way it's the Holy
[16:52] Ghost leading you all the way and you
[16:55] just continue
[16:57] but you know we don't have to we don't
[16:58] have to back up for the devil we don't
[17:01] have to accept
[17:03] somebody else's thoughts or ideas about
[17:06] it
[17:08] you know those Pharisees and Sadducees
[17:10] they they had heard for years all those
[17:14] Generations had heard that oral
[17:16] tradition as law
[17:19] and they wouldn't transgress that for
[17:21] nothing
[17:23] but here they are but they had spent
[17:26] more time worried about this the the
[17:29] certain things about tithing all these
[17:32] little mints and cumin and all this
[17:34] other stuff and Jesus said you've turned
[17:36] away from the way there matters of the
[17:39] scripture right
[17:41] because they're so because they were so
[17:43] interested in certain little things and
[17:45] they didn't understand the scene to look
[17:46] at the big picture
[17:48] and they had missed out and they were
[17:50] and they were so tied up with certain
[17:52] things that they missed God
[17:56] brother Branham said that the word was
[17:59] made flesh the Messiah was standing in
[18:03] front of them
[18:04] and they were so wrapped up in their own
[18:07] tradition of things that they were had
[18:10] missed the very God Messiah standing in
[18:14] front of them and standing there
[18:16] speaking to them
[18:18] and they had missed that's though they
[18:20] who they were looking for they had spent
[18:22] all these years looking
[18:25] hey we know the Messiah is coming with a
[18:27] messiah's coming he's going to fulfill
[18:29] the word
[18:31] but he didn't come the way they wanted
[18:33] him to he didn't come the way they
[18:35] expected him to and when he didn't come
[18:38] that way then they were
[18:40] then they they you know they come
[18:41] against him and brother Brown said they
[18:43] turned him down
[18:45] they turned it down
[18:47] but when Jesus stood before them and
[18:49] told them said search the scriptures
[18:52] and then you say you have eternal life
[18:56] but they are they that testify of me
[18:59] and here they are standing in front of
[19:01] them and beginning to speak the word
[19:06] and here they are expressing the word
[19:12] but Jesus brings them back
[19:15] to the under the true revelation of what
[19:17] the word says not just saying something
[19:22] you know
[19:23] you know throughout the
[19:26] the years
[19:28] we see a number of people
[19:32] and I thank God for our for our pastor
[19:35] and his ministry all these years but you
[19:37] know there's lots of people that that
[19:39] have heard and just like the Pharisees
[19:41] they've heard a commandment they've
[19:43] heard a tradition
[19:46] and it's like well
[19:48] you know what we all we all come we're
[19:50] here with this seed in US
[19:54] and it's like well let's go back to the
[19:56] scripture and let's see what the
[19:57] scripture says
[19:59] and you know and then it's like well you
[20:02] know you talk about Daniel 70 weeks or
[20:05] or different things you know
[20:07] you asked who's who's taught on the
[20:09] stature of a perfect man
[20:11] all these doctrines
[20:13] and it's like well you know we believe
[20:15] them but nobody nobody digs into them
[20:18] and it almost has become a tradition
[20:21] that people have not looked at the word
[20:24] that nobody's dug into the word but you
[20:26] know we've had a pastor that has really
[20:28] calmed this message
[20:30] and he is and he has labored in the word
[20:35] and we've had a five-fold Ministry
[20:37] brother Wade brother Bob from Louise
[20:40] man they have flavored in the word
[20:45] and you know we have we have the word
[20:48] and I think about brother Keith
[20:52] you know
[20:56] meeting
[20:57] I don't know when he met brother Dale
[20:59] brother Wade them but you know
[21:01] man I tell you what I I thoroughly have
[21:03] enjoyed
[21:05] I get to I don't know if y'all know this
[21:07] but not but brother Keith
[21:09] churches on YouTube you can you can
[21:12] listen to and uh I tell you what if you
[21:14] uh
[21:15] there's a little side note
[21:17] um if if you if you feel down and you
[21:20] don't think you can uh you need a little
[21:22] pick me up y'all listen to the song
[21:23] Services sometimes
[21:25] and uh I don't you know I think if if I
[21:28] don't stir your soul your spoon's fat
[21:29] all your bowl
[21:32] but you know you see these brothers and
[21:35] you know they have labored in the word
[21:39] and you know it was of course you know
[21:42] somebody had to set aside their their
[21:44] ideas their tradition whatever they
[21:47] thought and you know they had to get
[21:49] into the word and dig yes
[21:51] and you know just like when the
[21:54] disciples were there and and they are
[21:56] looking in the word but Peter had a
[21:58] revelation
[22:00] when Jesus stood there and told asked
[22:03] the disciples who do men say that I am I
[22:06] the son of man am
[22:08] well you're one of the prophets
[22:10] you know you're you're one but who do
[22:13] you say that I am
[22:15] not whatever what man says what
[22:18] everybody else says
[22:20] what's what's the leading thought of
[22:23] today
[22:24] but who do you say that I am
[22:27] and Peter stood there and says Thou Art
[22:29] the Christ the son of the Living God
[22:33] and he said blessed are you Simon
[22:35] barjona for Flesh and Blood never
[22:37] revealed this to you but my father's
[22:40] revealed this to you
[22:42] right and he said Upon This Rock I'll
[22:43] build my church
[22:45] they said the gates of hell
[22:47] won't Prevail against it
[22:49] brother Brown said he didn't mean that
[22:51] the gates of hell wouldn't come against
[22:52] you with everything that it had
[22:55] but the gates of hell can't Prevail over
[22:57] you the gates of hell all the power in
[23:01] hell can't overcome
[23:03] you can't be defeated
[23:06] if we stand on the word if there's a
[23:09] place that God has made for us to stand
[23:11] and that's where God has wanted us to be
[23:14] stand on the word because if we stand
[23:16] there then we have a place yes then when
[23:20] when we say well I don't understand
[23:22] something Peter didn't understand
[23:27] he didn't understand the disciples
[23:28] didn't understand
[23:30] but you know what they knew who he was
[23:32] and and they followed in what he had
[23:35] what he told them
[23:38] and so you know even in all their faults
[23:40] and failures you know what God didn't
[23:42] give Jesus didn't give up on them
[23:46] they you know
[23:48] what he told him he said I'm going to go
[23:51] away they said destroy this temple in
[23:53] three days and I'll raise it up again
[23:57] you know what Peter didn't agree with
[23:59] that
[24:00] Peter didn't say that
[24:03] but you know it didn't change it didn't
[24:04] change Jesus's fault on Peter
[24:08] he kept telling him said Peter when you
[24:10] when you get converted
[24:12] when you get over yourself when you get
[24:14] converted
[24:15] when you get over this when when the
[24:17] Holy Ghost comes in and quickens the
[24:20] word that you're holding
[24:22] listen strengthen your brethren
[24:26] you know when you think about all the
[24:27] faults and failures that Peter had and
[24:29] all the problems Jesus stand there and
[24:31] told him said Peter he said Satan has
[24:34] desired to sift you like wheat
[24:36] he said but I prayed for you
[24:40] he had somebody that was interceding on
[24:42] his behalf
[24:44] and let me tell you something we have a
[24:46] great high priest this morning
[24:48] and you know what he desires the best
[24:51] for each one of us and wherever you are
[24:53] this morning whatever your need is this
[24:55] morning he's here to meet
[24:58] and so whatever you have native you
[25:00] don't have to worry about the things
[25:01] that have come in the past you know what
[25:03] because the sea of forgetfulness is
[25:05] there The Depths to be all of your sin
[25:08] is to be put in the depths of the sea
[25:11] as as Paul said he said putting those
[25:14] things
[25:15] that are behind me
[25:17] he said I pressed toward the mark of the
[25:19] high calling I'm putting all these
[25:21] things behind me
[25:23] because you know if I just let all the
[25:26] things that I've seen all the things in
[25:27] my peripheral
[25:29] you know I you won't get anywhere
[25:33] and that's what the devil he brings all
[25:35] these things before you he wants you to
[25:36] keep I
[25:38] but there's one thing we do we keep our
[25:40] Eye On Christ amen we keep her out where
[25:43] he said for us to go he's made that
[25:45] promise that I'm not looking at what
[25:50] what doctors Reports say
[25:54] it's like
[25:57] our doctor says this
[25:59] but I got a doctor's report over here
[26:01] from the great physician
[26:03] it's like well which one am I going to
[26:06] look at
[26:09] him well you know what as long as long
[26:12] as you got breath in your body and you
[26:14] and you're still moving
[26:16] you know then you know what I'm still
[26:18] looking at my stripes we're healed
[26:20] nothing trumps that
[26:24] when the wind the the harder the battle
[26:26] the the more
[26:30] the Devil Comes against you then you
[26:32] know what it's the greater the victory
[26:35] when you say your your love lost your
[26:38] lost loved ones
[26:41] when you're when your children you and
[26:43] your
[26:44] are doing all kinds of things and you
[26:47] look and think well how's this how's
[26:48] this going to work out
[26:50] well you know what I ain't trying to
[26:52] figure out how it's going to work out
[26:55] God didn't ask me if to figure it out
[26:58] he said Do You Believe
[27:00] that I saw that's all I can do I can put
[27:02] it in God's hands because he's the one
[27:05] that'll take care of the problems he's
[27:07] the ones that'll solve it because I you
[27:10] know I always think about in the message
[27:12] letting off the pressure
[27:15] that sister that had the grown children
[27:19] and brothers talk about you know she's
[27:21] like 60 years old she looks 30.
[27:24] and she said well brother Brandon when I
[27:26] when I was young
[27:28] I give my heart to the Lord
[27:32] and said you know he said cast all you
[27:34] cares upon Him and he said that's what I
[27:36] done I cast all my cares on him
[27:38] and
[27:40] we'll have the musicians come on this
[27:42] morning
[27:43] we're getting ready to finish but
[27:45] he said I cast all my cares on him
[27:48] because I realize that he said he would
[27:51] take care of my problems he would take
[27:52] care of me and you know what I'll cast
[27:55] them all on him because you know what if
[27:57] he can't carry him I know I can't carry
[27:58] him amen and you know
[28:02] she had such peace she had let off all
[28:05] that pressure
[28:06] and you know what he didn't she wasn't
[28:08] worried about all these things she
[28:10] didn't carry all that stress and all
[28:12] that why
[28:13] and it showed on her countenance
[28:15] that she had cast her cares upon Him
[28:19] and it's the best place God wants us
[28:20] wants to carry your burdens
[28:23] he said come argue that labor and are
[28:25] heavy laden yes and he said I'll give
[28:27] you rest
[28:30] and you know many times we we want to
[28:32] just like the little story I'm gonna I'm
[28:34] gonna finish here but it was like the
[28:36] little story about the
[28:38] about the little boy that had the toy
[28:41] that brought it to his dad he wanted him
[28:42] to fix it
[28:45] and he kept wondering why he couldn't
[28:46] why his dad wouldn't fix it
[28:49] and he's like son he said as long as
[28:51] you're holding on to it I can't fix it
[28:53] but he said you've got to turn it over
[28:55] to me
[28:56] he said when you let go of it he said
[28:58] then I can fix it
[29:01] and many times in our lives we think
[29:02] we've turned things over to the Lord and
[29:04] really when we take a full account when
[29:07] we really sit down and pray about things
[29:09] sometimes we realize you know we think
[29:11] we turned over the Lord but we keep
[29:12] muddling in it
[29:13] yeah and we kept messing with it
[29:17] and you know what we turn it over to the
[29:19] Lord and say thank you Lord
[29:22] Ed I lay it in your hands
[29:25] well then you know I'm not I'm not
[29:26] digging in it anymore we're trying to
[29:27] figure out things
[29:29] I'm free of that
[29:32] because then then I don't have to try to
[29:34] try to figure it out or worry or fret or
[29:37] anything about it because it's in his
[29:40] hands
[29:40] amen God bless you this morning
[29:43] foreign
[29:44] [Applause]
