TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and u i i sure got to say how much I appreciate brother John and brother Aaron the last couple of weeks for uh for their lessons and what they had to say let's see if we can get it up there we go and bring you greetings from all the saints up up there in in Kentucky at brother Larry Harris Church um it's it's good to have uh fellowship with other believers that know they're kind of praying for you and and uh and believing the same thing let's let's uh go to the Lord in prayer before we get into our lesson Lord we just thank you Lord for the being able to gather around your word on this cold morning and thank God that we've got a a real fire lord Jesus to be warmed by not some pain and Fire Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll just warm our hearts Lord Jesus this morning as we ga gather around your word and study these things out Lord God help us to get the true essence of what these things mean Lord we pray in your name amen so um I'm going to read 2 Corinthians chap 3: 1-6 and then we'll kind of get in back into the kind of where we left off last time in Hebrews 13 um talking about remember them which have the rule over you and Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:1 he said Do We Begin Again to commit ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you I I I I was it's interesting to meditate on how often Paul Paul is just trying to convince people that that he writes these letters too and that he preaches to that we know what we're talking about he said you are our epistle written in our hearts you're the evidence you're the you're the evidence that our ministry is true you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing is of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life now there's there's something to really meditate on as we as we study this these things out in Hebrews 13 that that um without the spirit you the the spirit is what the spirit is what gives uh meaning to the scripture it's what even e even as I'm speaking the way that the word is conveyed actually gives uh backs up the meaning gives the essence of what I'm trying to communicate you know you maybe you hear like a preacher sometimes with a bad attitude and and it just comes across different maybe the same words technically it would be the same words but but it'll come because the spirit gives the puts the meaning to it even a husband uh you know tell saying something to his wife he can say something in the in the with a different spirit and it'll come across totally different so you can see what what the spirit does this the Holy Ghost is so important because because it will actually illuminate the word that we've heard and give the true meaning the true essence of it now look what Paul's saying here he says but with the spirit of the Living God and he's made us able Ministers of the New Testament and what's the New Testament that God would put to give us the same life that life that was in his blood the life it put give that give us that same life so that we can not just live by a letter by like a legalistic standpoint where we're trying to obey a set of rules and things but where he gives us his same life that can actually illuminate the true essence of the word and and make us live out the things that were typed in the Old Testament so it's actually living now there's the difference between a painted fire and a real something real they a painted fire might be where you could write the word fire or maybe you could read the word fire in your Bible but when it's really alive in you walking in your feed and your in your hands then it's something that other people can get warned by because it's real now so you can see the spirit is what gives life the spirit is what gives life to the word that we're reading about and you can see I've got this little this little illustration of the you know the the words coming off the page and so like when you're talking when you're sharing things the spirit is the the all these things that are encompassed here in this little slide the emotional tone what what is the essence when When God Says something to in his word what does it really mean and you'll never know what it really means unless the spirit illuminates it to you because the spirit is relationship like brother Aaron was sharing in his last Sunday school lesson communion with God the spirit is what brings communion where you can you actually know because you've got a relationship with God what the word is saying you've got the context and the background and not just the context where you can read the story but you've got a context where you can You've Got Your Own Story You've got your own background and you know because you've walked with God and you've lived through all these things what the word is saying because the spirit is Illuminating it in your life so that's what the spirit does and that's in John chapter 16 why why John said when he or Jesus said there in in John when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come that's the spirit of Truth the spirit of truth is actually guiding you through the word and he's not going to speak of himself but he's going to illuminate the things that have already been spoken as we read through the word we're we're reading the we're reading what the prophets have said what Jesus said what Jesus spoke for those three and A2 years and the spirit is taking those things and bringing them to life in your life and giving you the true understanding of what's really being spoken now it's so important to understand that when you read this scripture that we kind of been meditating on remember them which have the rule over you cuz you can take that scripture and go two ways you can go rule like brother brandham would explain as as he went through the seven Church ages that nickan Spirit would rule over people and try to control them and force them like Augustine of hippo got in his head that I'm going to if they won't believe it I'm just going to burn them at the steak I'm going to threaten them I'm going to drag them out on the ice and I'm going to say you believe what I what I tell you or I'm going to force you to do it and that nickola it's an idea that takes the Liberty that takes the holy ghost out of the church that tries to control people by force or you can take where it's actually the word of God is controlling you and and and and and taking charge over your life now you see those there there's such a big difference between those two views but it takes the spirit to actually illuminate it and present present the real the real truth of the thing remember them which have the rule over you not man not a man ruling over you and forcing you to be a Christian or something like that that but the the word being presented through a man that's yielded by the holy go yielded to the Holy Ghost where the word can actually Captivate you and God can speak to your heart and begin to draw you where it's not you trying to live according to a set of rules and trying to satisfy God by your works but actually God claiming your life and beginning to draw you to himself I think so many people have got in their head that that's what the message really is is is a bunch of legalistic rules but that's not it at all it's God grabbing you by the word and you yielding yourself to it and saying Lord I'm going to let you I'm going to I want you to claim my life and claim my heart and claim my being and God you hear the voice of God and and it it's you know the the the the real the truth of the thing is that some people just will not be able to hear God calling them but some people will be able to respond to it that's right and so you can't it's not by it's not by force it's not by grabbing somebody and putting them in a headlock and trying to drag them to it because it's it's it's it's God that's do it no man can come to the father except he draw them so it's God that does the drawing it's God that does the calling remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation now there we've got these two ways that you can look at this scripture one somebody's somebody say you believe it or else and on the other it's the voice of God calling and drawing and the only way that you'll know the true essence of not just this scripture but any scripture in the Bible all these doctrines is by the holy ghost in your life giving a real relationship with him to open up and illuminate the word right in Matthew chapter 23 I I I think it's interesting too to meditate on how Jesus would just he would hit at this this Pharisee lay out a a a legalistic idea that you you got to have all these burdens and and all these rules and things that you've got to follow like in Matthew chapter 23 where he said saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in moses' seat all therefore whatsoever they bid You observe that that observe and do but did not do not ye after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with but but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers and now Matthew 23 is a good chapter because that whole chapter is about this concept that uh uh uh that the legalistic mindset but we're talking about remember them to have rule over you the rule the rule to be a to to to to preach a word that can Captivate and draw people to God not to the minister or not to a particular geographic location not to a particular church but to Christ and he gave some Apostles and some prophets in Ephesians chapter 4 and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so last time we as we were kind of going through all these we we we ended up at teachers and we looked at how Apostles or Setters in order a man that will come in and and set a church get a church started and and wait and labor with the people until a pastor is established and go into a territory where where nobody's been before and the gospel hasn't been presented and go in and and be able to labor with people that don't you know don't know anything about Christianity many times and Prophets that are seers that can look into the lift it up and look over the fence and in God's eternity and come back and tell you things that that nobody else with it with that doesn't have that gift or's able to do an evangelist can stir up the people and preach an encouraging word and make you feel like man I I want to go home and pray some more and pastors that can that can counsel and labor with the people and deal with their troubles and like an ox that can bear their burdens and and and you can tell all your troubles and things to the pastor and they'll help you out and and teachers that will we're going to break down just for a few moments here brother Brown said a teacher is a special man he sits back under the anointing of the spirit and I got a little puzzle here and is able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor or evangelist either one can not compare with them so see well now what the what the teachers doing we'll we'll come we'll come to church maybe and we'll not understand like some of these complex things that brother R preached about and it seems real confusing when you've after you've come under the influence of a teacher you're you leave the building feeling like you know I can't understand some somebody will come in and like maybe maybe you heard an evangelist that preach preached it maybe a vague way to kind of stir up the people and they just couldn't WR couldn't quite nail down exactly the details of what's happening with a new birth experience or what's what do we do what what do we do excuse me at church and but a teacher will take these these things that are it's like a puzzle and will break it apart to you so that you believe and you're under you can understand and you begin to understand because a teacher can break it break it down in a way where now there's there's the thing with a teacher a teacher will not produce confusion but a teacher will produce Clarity a teacher is going to remove the confusion where you leave you leave satisfied that you're able you're getting something brother R said and you must be born again he said when you're born again God vindicates you that's how God vindicates all of his Nature by their fruits that's the way he vindicates his ministry that's right all of his servants are Vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it's a peach tree now this is kind of getting into the calling too how do you know what you are like like you know brother Le Louise probably knows when some of the foreign countries and stuff they want to know what are you are you a teacher are you an evangelist and so you know sometimes Maybe you wonder what are you but he said what how you know what you are is By The Fruit by the effect of your ministry where you kind of fall in that slot and where you are will be will be uh everybody will know everybody know will know what you are because it's it's like a fruit tree they everybody will know if you're a peach tree or apple tree or whatever it's it's on display all of his servants are Vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it's a peach tree cuz it brings peaches how do you know it's an apple tree baring apples how do you know it's a Christian Christian signs bear from it Christian Life comes out of it now that's I want to live a life so so close to God where people don't wonder if I'm a Christian that's where you have a problem if I I don't I think there I don't how do you know how do you know he's a teacher the word comes from him now what that means is if you say you're a teacher and everything's confusing and you're not able to you're not able to string things together and nobody know after you get done it's just a mess of confusion that are you are you a teacher but when you when you you can preach and lay it out and everybody leaves feeling like they really got fed and and and and here's the thing too they recognize that you study because a pre a teacher is going to be called to study not just sitting there W watching Netflix all day or sitting there pumping their mind full of a bunch of Tommy rot but they're going to get in the word and labor and study because that's that's the fruit that a teacher is going to Bear a teacher a teacher can't help but get in the word cuz that's what a teacher does how you going to have anything to teach if you don't labor and studying the word So What do teachers do teachers are primarily focused on explaining and making scripture and Doctrine clear making it clear educating the church in biblical truth what does justification mean what does sanctification me break that down if it takes 10 sermons to do break it down what really happen what what really happens when the word is sown in your heart and why it's important to come to church and break all those things down so the people leave not being confused but understanding what it means to be a Christian and deepening the understanding of faith brother R would say now now here's really what a teacher does a teacher he can explain the word so you're bound to see it somebody can come to church with all their ideas and their opinions about well I think it should go this way and you listen to a teacher that breaks it down and and and after you're done somebody maybe maybe don't know nothing about nothing will come forth think I you know what I believe I I believe I can understand these things I I I I see it I I you can't help but see it when a teacher runs runs it down through the scripture from Genesis to Revelation and breaks it down a way that's clear and and and adds Clarity to the people you're bound to see it if you got any eyes to see it with you'll see it right now that's the gift of a teacher not to confuse but to bring Clarity the teacher has a special gift some of these things I just kind of pulled off the the internet different people things are say so this isn't something that brother Brown said but it goes right along with it a teacher the teacher has a special gift for clarifying confusion and misinformation making complex biblical Concepts understandable to Their audience and a teacher is going to be inclined to thoroughly research and explore topics that others might find mundane are complex and you might believe a teacher is going to want to dive into Daniel 70 weeks even though maybe nobody else wants to get into that and they'll dive into it and spend time on it and or so anything like that something some some topics like that that others may not approach because a teacher wants to bring it's their gift to the church they want to bring Clarity so that other people can understand the things that that many others are afraid to probe at so they play a crucial role in challenging untruths and stirring curiosity and hunger for the scriptures and this is a picture of Ezra reading from the scroll when all the people they wanted to they wanted to have their life straightened up in there in Nehemiah they were they were willing to sit and just listen to him and questions and answers brother Ram said you must come under teaching you say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come my friends that gives me just a little room to doubt whether you've really got it or not then see the way you're acting with it see the thing you're doing now why if there is no if the Bible says the holy spirit is the teacher why did the Holy Spirit put teachers in the church then to set the church in order the same Holy Spirit sure we don't need these seminaries to go around a big bunch of men to look out these things the holy spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher and it gives some fellow a gift of teaching then you must be subject to that gift now an't that what an interesting Dynamic that you sitting there with the Holy Ghost In Your Heart can listen to a man that's got the Holy Ghost in his heart that's called and has a special anointing to study these things out that maybe in your in Your Capacity as a little housewife or something that don't don't have the ability to go labor and study these things out and and open up library books and and things and and run run the all these deep things through the scripture but God God puts a special gift in a teacher to be able to speak to you and it's the Holy Ghost working in the teacher and the in the church and the person sitting there the Holy Ghost working and all and God give that gift in the church so that you could understand and have Clarity that's why he said in the seven Church ages God raise up ministers everywhere fill them with with the Holy Spirit now now this will squash that idea that we just sit at home without any ministers fill them with the Holy Spirit and send them forth preaching Lord like firebrands we don't know what hour we only passed this away once we're only mortal once and thanks be to God for that but the next life the next life will not preach the gospel and the next life that is to come but we rejoice in the gospel with them of the ages who's accepted it with a head captain our lord Jesus who's all worthy and all praise be to him forever and ever these kind of quotes really motivate me so many times brother R would say you've only got so many so many years to have children so many years to live for God so many years so you might as well that that encourages me when I when you know when you're driving on the road and things and you get tired and uh traveling and thing do as much as you can for the for the Lord because you've only got this little span of time that's what he's saying God rais up ministers everywhere why you can preach the gospel why you can do something something for the Lord because that's that's the only thing that matters is what we do for others and what we do for God so in second Peter Peter saying wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall now just I I want to just meditate on how God calls a minister because you really you really like go all the way through the scripture it's it's God and every everything the reason why you're sitting here in church is not because anything you did the reason why you got the Holy Ghost is because go God did it he drew you he called you you all you did is respond you just you just you just you just accepted the invitation and and so it's the same with with a minister God God knows the special qualities that are in a man and he begins to draw and woo him and and that's one evidence of the way that a minister is calling brother R said it's the guy that's trying to run from it is the one that God uses see if he's trying to get away from it now really what's what's he saying here trying to get away from it not not where somebody says you better run no but it's the man who realizes within themself that they are inadequate that that that what a doning challenge lays in front of them and they can't do it within their own capacity even you know you're sitting back there in that Pastor study and you're sometimes before you come out and like Lord I I is is it going to work this time because you can't do it of your own ability and and you think about all these examples Through the Bible of Jonah and Moses and Gideon and Jeremiah Jeremiah that say it said told told the Lord I I cannot speak for I am a child now there's a man that's running from his calling because he knows that in his own self he's inadequate and and and and brother Ra was going say that's that's how you know is something real cuz when you're trying when you're trying to put yourself into that position and trying to do it yourself because you think you're the best one for the job that's a good that's a good Mark that something's off because our depend we're depending on God for everything we're depending on God for everything that we say and everything we do we're trusting in Jesus for it he said the callings in me if he's trying to get away from it oh brother I tell you the callings in me but I man I'd hate to try that well there you are you see that that's trying to run if he wants to do it so bad the first thing you know he finds himself a stuffed shirt somebody that's arrogant somebody thinks they know more than everybody else oh that's that's where the spirit comes in if you've got the right Spirit it actually will open up doors if you if you got the right Spirit well you can convey it like not like somebody told me a minister said you know some some some people will get up behind the pullit like they've got their two guns blazing ready to shoot at the place and ready to tear set everybody in order but somebody that's humble that's that that that that that's coming with the right spirit because the spirit conveys the right meaning behind The Words the spirit is going to give the essence of what's trying to be communicated he said like you said God you give me power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you if you let me move mountains no he wouldn't he can't even move himself to the right attitude so he'd never move mountains for God oh that's that's something to really meditate on to have the right attitude we remember where brother R said I'd rather have the right Spirit I'd rather have the right spirit because if you got the right Spirit everything is going to move into place if you can be taught if you can be moved by the word then everything else will line up eventually but if you got the wrong Spirit nobody's going to be able to tell you anything uh and anyway I'm get off that questions and answers brother Ram said so always do this make your how you make your calling an election sure whenever you feel that you're supposed to do a thing first find out if a scripture will do it he said first I'm going to skip down to what's in yellow first see if God calls then usually I I watch it for myself this is me I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift that they're professing see God will work his creature the way he's made him he'll make a creature if you see him real real flighty and going on and he says and the musicians can go ahead and come and we'll end on this the Lord called me for such and such to be a pastor now Pastor can be a flighty person a pastor's solid sound see God called me to be a teacher and watch him how he interprets the word see he gets it all mixed up and everything then you can tell see but then the next thing to do the thing to do your position is usually known whether you can do it or not I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift that they're professing your position is usually known whether you can do it or not God bless you Saints we'll end right [Applause] there
