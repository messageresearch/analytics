then also I want to mention so we'll have the afternoon service brother Aaron's birthday is today so happy birthday brother Aaron Cambridge was yesterday and also sister Valerie Stanley and brother Isaac is uh coming up on Valentine's Day right so God bless them happy birthday to them thank you God bless you thanks we've got a full house this morning we had a we had a wonderful time last night didn't we that was I love laughing and having a good time with family and y'all are my family let me see if I can get this slideshow started we've been going through the book of Hebrews and um and made it through three verses of Hebrews 11. so we're going to get to verse four let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we begin our study Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning as we look into these things Lord I pray you lord it's your Quicken that to us give us an understanding Lord Jesus so we can read between the lines and I pray God that you'll just prepare our minds Lord to receive the word that comes forth and the sermons today Lord God granted Lord Jesus bless the services we pray in your name amen now Hebrews 11 verse 1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good rapport so if you want to have a good report if you want to please God you've got to have faith and we were kind of laying down the last few Sunday school lessons about how that faith is based upon something not just based upon your own ideas or just uh like like somebody came to brother Brown and said can I just I could just put my hand on a tree and I'd have faith no he got to base it on something and we base it upon God's word and so all these things that Paul says leading up to chapter 11 is to to ground us that we can trust what God said that he gave us two immutable things he uh God they can't lie made a promise on they made a nose on top of that and all these things that to give us confidence to build us our confidence up that we can trust what God says we can believe what God Said now Hebrews 11 has all these examples that when you believe God something's going to happen we're not just believing for something in vain and and one of the first examples I want to look at is is that uh is the life of Abel um so verse 3 says through through faith we understand that the world we're framed by the word of God so that things which were not seen were were not made of which are seen were not made of things which do appear you know like I said last Sunday that that should give us confidence to know that if if uh if the worlds were framed by the word of God well what kind of effect can the word of God have in our life that the word of God can have an effect on the cosmos and the and the and the and the Very Earth that we're standing on to holding in his position and and situate it so that we can have life and breathe air and all those things all by the word of God and what what kind of confidence should we have that the word of God would have an effect in our own lives and so that's the kind of confidence that all these great Heroes of Faith in Hebrews 11 have that that they knew that if they trusted God if they trusted what he said that something was going to happen and so in verse 4 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous y'all excuse me this morning God testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yes speaketh now now you think about what a situation that was that Abel had heard the story about his how his parents were kind of had to leave the Garden of Eden and what had happened there and I was reading a quote yesterday where brother Brown said that um that Adam and uh that Cain and Abel had been instructed by Adam and Eve and maybe just growing up they had had heard all the little stories about how that God clothed them when they were leaving the Garden of Eden and and um that their their their their their covering of fig leaves wasn't good enough and and all those things and yeah you see so you see that now Cain and Abel were really on the same level as far as that goes as far as the education that they had and the kind of the background but there was something that set Cain and Abel apart something that differentiated them one had something the other didn't and what the one had what Abel had was a revelation from God you see a revelation is what makes a difference Revelation is the is the thing when the maniac of gadar brother Raymond said look come in here at Abel not with the working not trying to work something up and that what we do sometimes we try to force it we try to work work try to try to make it happen but it's got to be just something natural that comes wrap the little Vine around this old sheep's neck and here you come pulling him up there throwing him up on the Altar and begin to beat his throat and killed him what a what a what a strange horrible looking situation but Abel did all those things because he had a revelation of what God required you think about you think about what that Revelation gave Abel that he knew the predicament that he was in he knew how they got there and he knew how to get back and this morning you can have that same Revelation how to get back into fellowship with God if you can if God can reveal to you that you need something that you need a redeemer to reveal to you that you ain't where you're supposed to be and reveal to you how to get back that you need a blood covering then something can happen just like it did with Abel you know sometimes we forget in the story that that something happened when Abel offered up that sacrifice God recognized that sacrifice some way or another he knew that God accepted that his faith and and and and he recognized it and God recognized his his faith and his sacrifice and what he what he came to offer in such a way that it got Cain kind of kind of upset a little bit so this morning maybe if we have time we'll examine that how did how did God recognize Abel's sacrifice you know this is uh looking back 10 years ago this was maybe more than 10 years ago this is the very first Sunday school lesson that I ever gave was Abel's sacrifice so that's kind of interesting for me why Abel had a revelation we're letting that soak just a minute it was a revelation that Abel had that made him just the Revelation that Abel had that made him just he had a revelation of the requirement of almighty God and he brought a lamb and that's the only way that you'll ever be able to see Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by revelation to see God's requirement that God made a sacrifice for you that's what you needed the blood that what's the requirement the requirement is life they brought around well in Genesis chapter four it said if we go back and it said in in prop in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel into his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance failed now as we started this out you can kind of see you see the difference there they they both had a religious education they both had an understanding of religious precepts and things like like going to church and paying your tithes and being a good citizen and and all those kind of things but see that's not good enough just going to church and warming the Pew and keeping the lights on and all those kind of things is not good enough the difference is a revelation you've got to have a revelation of what God requires your brother said in the faith it was once delivered to the Saints he said now look at Cain in the Garden of Eden Cain when he come back to Eden he was just as religious as he could be he was just as religious as he could be he brought flowers and so forth and put them on the altar he brought the fruits of the field and laid them laid them down he believed in God he worshiped God he sacrificed to God he built a church to God just as religious as he could be I got all these highlighted so it really stands out to us this morning just as religious as he could be and Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a Church of Worship place that Cain had all this stuff all these things that he was doing and all this all this religious things that were that were backing up what his form of worship but Abel just rolled up a rock it's it's simplistic if you if you know a revelation of your God a revelation trumps all the religious forms and like we were sharing uh how when we went to Nicaragua we got to we got to take a look at one of those the this big Catholic church and they had all the forms and all the gold-plated things and all of that all that built up and big models of the all the different things of Jesus's life and of a finger that you could look at of Jesus being crucified and Jesus rising from the grave and all those things but yet where where's the Revelation Revelation is what separates the thing Revelation is what makes a difference and brother I'm sitting in the face that was once delivered to the Saints he said if oh if you can only see this you'll see the greatest thing you've seen in years look not because I'm standing here saying it but if you can understand how it is that faith is not something mentally perceived but it is a revelation a revelation of God by faith not intellectual but by his heart oh you see now there's the difference between Cain and Abel Cain was coming in with a mental understanding an intellational understanding based on what his mama and daddy had taught him see that's how sometimes we come to church when and brother round would you know he would constantly say you can't go on anybody's coattails based on just what somebody's told you you got to have your own personal revelation for yourself and you come like like Cain did Cain was just coming with the best he knew how but but he was missing that that uh the the Revelation now in Hebrews chapter 9 it says how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God now we a couple of chapters ago we study that out and we we began to realize that God wants us to to not just serve him in this form like Cain was doing he wants to purge our conscience from dead work dead what is dead Works dead works is when you're just coming to church and you're going through the motions without Revelation but you're trying to do it by works by because you see other people that are paying their tithes and their their you know Paving the parking lot or doing things baking cookies and doing all the things that church people do but without a revelation see the Revelation is what brings the thing to life Revelation is what allows you to serve a living God a living God that will come down and recognize your faith like he recognized Abels that will recognize your faith like he recognize Noah's faith that when Noah believed him the flood came and the rain began to fall and he when Enoch believed that he he got a body change he he he left the Earth because when you believe God you're suffering a living God a living reality not just going through some kind of dead Works where you're just trying to work something up serving him by a mental there's the difference between Cain and Abel a mental understanding an intellectual understanding and a revelation and wrote what is revelation Revelation ties you to something Eternal it is a substance it's something that you can hang everything on that nobody's going to take away from you so something that uh it is it it is something where God's going to come and back it up like he backed up what Abel believed when Abel believed God God came down on the scene and consumed that Sacrifice by fire and you you reckon you you come to God with that same kind of faith and he'll come and fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he'll he'll recognize your sacrifice your faith the same way that he recognized Abel's Faith so now you've got those two what the two differences that the tree of knowledge is full of full of like mental understanding education that's why I think brother Brown was so against education not education like um you gotta you when you gotta have if you're gonna have a job you got to be educated at least enough to be able to if you to know how to swing a hammer and nail a nail or uh you know put wires together if you're wiring a house not in that kind of education but when we come together and we just get so educated to where we we think we know a lot it's just mental and that begins to take you away from God but a real Revelation is the thing that ties us back to God where God can work through our lives that's the difference education and Revelation see God brother Brown was never against you knowing something and being being able to provide for your family being able to provide but but when education takes you away from God where you just start you just start getting built up in what you know and and uh you can get you know like a doctor can get so educated where they think they understand how everything works and how your body works and they you know what education will not tell you about education can tell you about how trees work and how uh all the different components of your body and things but one thing education will never be able to tell you about is life brother Adam said you can go out and look at the grass growing in the field and that you can look and figure out all the chlorophyll and all that stuff but one thing science will never be able to tell you is how life came in that piece of grass you see that's what the gospel is for that's that's what Abel's Revelation was really about life that when they hear that they were they were they were they had to leave the Garden of Eden because life got messed up they came he was born the wrong way and the way back was through life the shed blood of an animal the shed blood of Christ that's the way back is through the life of God and the believer that's that's what makes the difference in life God's life is God's life is his rep and God Reveals His word to you that's the life of God coming in your life and and showing himself to you and revealing himself to you to so that it makes his life living in you there's a difference now uh I don't meet the preach this morning let me get I'm gonna get carried away God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same brother around said notice he built this Altar and he's more like put flowers and fix it up and put beautiful trees and thought surely a great holy clean beautiful God will accept that sacrifice what's the requirement for God to accept your sacrifice this morning God wants to see your faith God almost don't want to see your dead works and just coming to church and living out trying to work something up and make it happen God wants to see your faith in God's word but see he done it with his own wisdom he'd done it by his own thoughts and that's what it is today to do it by their own wisdom by their schooling by their education and ethics that they have learned but Abel by a revelation by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as it looked humanly speaking the little fella and grabbed him by the neck and wrapping a Vine around him like that and pulled him along to this altar there was nothing so beautiful about it laying him upon the Altar and hacking his little throat with a sharp rock until his blood flying all over him bleeding dying it was a horrible sight to see it it's a horrible it was a horrible sight when Jesus died on the cross and it'll be a horrible sight when you die to your own self because whenever life comes when life was given on the cross it was a horrible sight and when life comes into you it'll be a horrible sight laying on the floor snotting and crying out to God when God fuels you with his life it's a horrible sight because you're dying out to yourself oh that's what God wants you don't want this dead works but he wants a living reality in the life of the Believers and he said it was simple it was simple though it's Simplicity he know that he was born of his mother and father's blood there's Abel's Revelation if you want to ask this morning what what did Abel see he'd know that he was born of his mother and father's blood his mother and father's life and there's the problem born in his mother's Blood by his father's blood and it was blood that caused the fall so it was blood that would take it back what's Abel's Revelation life life is in the blood he come by the wrong life he come by the wrong way and it would take it would take life to bring him back it was blood that would take it back so he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to him oh you see when it's revealed Revelation takes you beyond anything and all the education you can come to church and how many times maybe you've heard somebody preach a real great sermon about Daniel 70 weeks or just just some something that would you know somebody was telling me about somebody that preached A good sermon and then they went off into the world and things because you can you can have a good education of something but it not be revealed Revelation goes beyond the education because it communicates the essence of it to you Revelation is something it's It's Supernatural Revelation is not something that somebody taught to you that somebody educated into you but it's a supernatural thing that God has given to you a supernatural understanding of his word brother random said how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God by faith he received the revelation of the blood of the blood Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment he had all the education he had the Commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice it was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life now you might take what the pastor says but what the Seminary teaches and though it might be taught to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual Revelation that does it oh you see why Revelation is the most important what God reveals to you that you're born again ain't nothing difficult to say take that away from you when God reveals to you the the right way to be baptized what God reveals to you that godhead when God Reveals All these things to you it's something that it's it's not an education it's beyond that because it's supernatural a supernatural gift from God and wisdom versus Faith he said now notice by faith Abel saw the Revelation the vision and brought a living running blood because life was in the blood I I want you to get this morning what Abel's Revelation was his Revelation was life a living running blood it couldn't be just some some animal that had been laying out there for for a week decaying but life is in the blood it had to be a living animal that he cut that animal's throat and that blood run down bleeding and everything life is in the stem of the flower and it's botany life which has no feeling I was in hopes that was sinking and Able by faith staying with the word by faith not wisdom by faith he's seen that it was sex blood the blood cell comes from the male the male the man has the blood cell and the sperm the hemoglobin is the blood comes through the male and Adam noted it wasn't apples and peaches and potatoes or whatever it was that brought them out of the Garden of Eden that caused the sin it was sex blood and he offered blood back by faith he done it not by wisdom how is a man through wisdom going to understand it when the whole Bible and the whole Church of God is built upon divine revelation absolutely by faith let me just read some quotes but we've got five more minutes to just kind of close and just kind of uh move into move into this thought he in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said the germ of life life is what we're talking about to the child come from the male sex we know that don't we it's like a hen can lay an egg but if she hasn't been with a male bird it's not fertile see it won't hatch The Germ of Life comes from the male and God making his promise the life germ lays in the male's blood the male sex produces the life you realize that the female has nothing to do with it no more than the incubator but it's the man the male the sperm the life is in the mail I I hope we're this morning we're looking at pattern you can see that pattern everywhere you can get real educated in the message you can get real educated have a good education but if the life if God doesn't come and Quicken that to you then it's just going to be dead you got to you've got to be with Christ and for second Corinthians it says who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit not just a good education but of the of spirit of life we got to have life life is the thing for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so life what are we talking about I'm talking about Abel's Revelation this morning a revelation of life we got five more minutes y'all get your naps out in five minutes [Laughter] now there's the difference there's a difference between Abel and Cain Cain coming with just a carnal fleshly understanding because he'd been educated educated well and here come Abel with a it looked like just a dirty blood running down a gory nasty nasty kind of religion the kind of religion where people shout and people want to praise God and it just looks it just looks nasty to the world it looks it looks horrible somebody somebody at the altar dying and crying out to themselves people coming up because they want to be saved they want to be changed see that's what we believe in this morning is a religion a gospel that will change you and not leave you not leave you just serving a god based on dead works not just trying to work something up but a God that will change you this morning by the Revelation by the revealing of his word of the shed blood for an Adam all die you've been born wrong even so in Christ shall all be made alive how by his blood by the blood that he shed for us to release his life on the cross that that same life could come back and live in you now Abel's Revelation was based in in Genesis chapter 2 it says in the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest free to eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatst thereof Thou shalt surely die I I think Sunday school sometimes is a good opportunity to just kind of back up a second and let's examine what we believe so let's back up a second and look at what Abel was believing in the last two or three minutes here and y'all I ain't gonna finish I will we'll we'll continue on this home for the next time what was let me skip over that and go back in Genesis chapter 3 it said the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field because they ate from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil did what God Said uh he's cursing the serpent for what what uh the serpent did the lie that he told Eve upon thy belly that shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of our life now now let's let's just examine that for a second we can tell here that the serpent first of all his first condition was he was not on his belly crawling around so there you can see let's let's paint a picture in our mind now now he he's a serpent is a he's a beast that he can talk and he can converse with somebody I hope we can read between the lines here and at least see that much that the sir it says serpent but he his first condition was not on the ground and then he got cursed and now he's on the ground so that paints a picture for us that he was in some kind of condition where an upright condition where he could talk to Eve and tell her things and then he got changed into something where he's on the ground crawling around and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman he's this is speaking of Christ and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heal and that what Christ did on the cross between thy seed and her seed so the the serpent has a seed and there's another and the woman has a seed now if we can get a picture in our mind of what those two things are we can get a we can start to get an understanding of what Abel saw what gave faith faith to Abel and we're certainly not going to finish that in two minutes in proverbs 30 it says such as the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness I'm hopping around through slides let's go back let's the serpent see brother Adam said what was the seed of the serpent the seed of the serpent was adultery you follow it adultery with he what's adultery now Spirit you got spiritual adultery I'm gonna have to come to a screech and stop we're gonna stop there and we'll finish next time always at war with the clock [Applause] thank you
