[27:18] working on the deer land so
[27:20] just keep us in your prayers that way
[27:22] we'll be back on tuesday
[27:23] so um and then right after the service
[27:26] we're going to
[27:27] a death
[27:30] a burial and a resurrection amen
[27:35] the old man's gonna die and there's a
[27:38] new man gonna come to life
[27:40] so we'll be able to see how that god
[27:43] does it
[27:45] god does it really nice
[27:49] death burial resurrection right there in
[27:53] one
[27:56] one instant and thank god that we see
[27:59] that some are walking
[28:00] in newness of life and some are are
[28:02] carrying on i was
[28:04] if you go back to my old when we were
[28:06] preaching on a revival
[28:07] always after a plague there's a revival
[28:11] so i think this plague that we're seeing
[28:14] now that we're really going to see and
[28:15] and i
[28:16] i know some are at brother dale and i
[28:18] were talking another day some are having
[28:20] a revival
[28:21] but i told you it was not a church
[28:22] revival it's a personal revival
[28:25] so it's a personal revival it will never
[28:27] be another brother brown said it'll
[28:29] never be a worldwide
[28:30] sweeping revival it'll never be a
[28:32] revival that'll catch attention the
[28:33] third poll is not for the world it's not
[28:35] for
[28:36] you understand what i'm saying it's not
[28:38] a public show
[28:39] but we can have a revival in our hearts
[28:42] every day how that god i you know you
[28:45] get up in the morning
[28:46] and you you just thank god that you did
[28:49] something that probably
[28:50] hundreds of thousands of people were not
[28:52] going to be able to do that day
[28:54] because that many people die every every
[28:56] day around the world
[28:58] and they didn't get up like you did but
[29:01] you did
[29:02] you got to get up you got to breathe
[29:03] breath and you got to
[29:07] then turn that to praise him for letting
[29:10] that happen
[29:11] so we're on the feast of the lord and
[29:13] today is part six which would be
[29:15] feast of trumpets now i want you to
[29:17] understand something before we get
[29:18] started
[29:20] there's a difference in the feast of
[29:22] trumpets
[29:23] and the seven trumpets in the book of
[29:25] revelations but they do compare together
[29:29] and i'll show it to you in just a little
[29:30] while so everybody got that say amen
[29:33] so we're gonna talk brother brown
[29:34] preached on the feast of trumpets
[29:35] remember the
[29:36] um he he tried for months to get a
[29:40] building to preach on
[29:41] on the the seven trumpets and the seven
[29:43] trumpets and the seven trumpets and he
[29:45] was pushing pushing puss and
[29:47] pushing because he saw him in there he
[29:49] saw him in the bible
[29:50] plagues vials and all that and then god
[29:53] just
[29:53] kind of shut the door and if you're a
[29:56] minister if you've ever studied anything
[29:58] you sometimes you have to
[29:59] go by the leading of the lord sometimes
[30:01] you you know
[30:02] you get up against that wall and you
[30:04] don't go any further and god wants you
[30:06] to go a different direction
[30:08] so then he revealed to brother adam when
[30:10] he preached the feast of the trumpets
[30:12] which is what we're going to talk about
[30:13] today
[30:14] that he had already preached seven
[30:16] trumpets in the seals so
[30:18] he had already preached them
[30:19] supernaturally so
[30:21] what we're looking at today all these
[30:23] feast days
[30:25] they're natural happenings but to me and
[30:27] you it we're still on the journey of a
[30:28] christian
[30:29] right this is your journey of going from
[30:32] justification to sanctification to the
[30:34] baptism of the holy ghost
[30:36] and then growing further in
[30:38] justification sanctification in the
[30:40] baptism of the holy ghost as you go up
[30:41] the pyramid
[30:43] and further on up to the headstone you
[30:45] go through the justification
[30:47] sanctification in a higher order but
[30:49] we'll stay right
[30:50] down here on the bottom if you don't
[30:51] mind for today so leviticus 23
[30:55] verse 23 let's remember all these that
[30:58] are sick
[30:59] mom with sinus infection and and
[31:03] all the different ones i talk i call bob
[31:05] and
[31:06] and louise between services and they're
[31:09] okay
[31:09] um they're getting on the side of
[31:13] uh bob said he was a little bit tired
[31:15] yesterday i told him that's just cause
[31:16] he's getting old
[31:18] so i can't blame that on a virus

[33:14] 23
[33:15] the lord spake unto moses saying
[33:17] speaking to the children of israel
[33:20] in the seventh month now remember we
[33:22] when we started
[33:23] in the other feast which we're going to
[33:24] go through the feast of
[33:26] passover and unleavened bread first
[33:28] fruit
[33:29] and pentecost is in the spring
[33:33] now we've went through several months
[33:36] now
[33:37] and it's going to be the seventh month
[33:38] not the first month because remember the
[33:40] first month
[33:42] of the jewish christian
[33:45] their christian or religious calendar is
[33:48] what apr
[33:49] is march april all right that's their
[33:50] first first day of the month
[33:52] now this october or the seventh month
[33:56] is going to be their beginning of their
[33:59] civil calendar
[34:01] and if you'll notice even in uh brother
[34:03] john knows that some people have a july
[34:05] the first
[34:06] fiscal year some have an october fiscal
[34:09] year
[34:09] like governments do a lot of october
[34:11] fiscal years and we used to do it when
[34:13] uh when we had a business there uh we'd
[34:15] do it then so
[34:17] there's several m this one then is the
[34:19] jewish
[34:20] first month of the civil calendar but
[34:23] the seventh month
[34:26] according to the bible the seventh month
[34:29] in the first day of the month shall you
[34:32] have a sabbath
[34:34] a memorial of blowing of trumpets and
[34:36] holy convocation you shall do no servile
[34:39] work therein but you shall offer an
[34:41] offering made by fire
[34:43] unto the lord you may be seated in the
[34:44] lord as blessing to the reading of the
[34:46] word now we
[34:48] have been over this and i hope that it
[34:52] it's just not a jewish thing it's for
[34:54] it's for each one of us
[34:56] it's for each one of us to take
[35:00] and know that when we go through these
[35:02] things that's what i've been trying to
[35:04] get to you with the
[35:05] with the believers and the journey of a
[35:07] believer when somebody
[35:08] in the bible did something ruth
[35:12] boaz and all these different uh
[35:14] characters in the bible
[35:16] they were doing that as an example for
[35:19] me and you
[35:21] remember i read in the bible that these
[35:23] were given for examples to whom the ends
[35:25] of the world have come upon
[35:26] so they're our examples they were
[35:28] physical people but they didn't know
[35:30] i don't think at the time that when they
[35:31] were going through these things that
[35:33] brother john they'd say well no in 2020
[35:36] no no they didn't know that
[35:39] they were living their life out and
[35:42] these things were happening
[35:44] according to the foreknowledge of god
[35:47] i don't know if y'all ever heard the
[35:49] foreknowledge of okay all right
[35:51] yeah that's good but by the
[35:54] foreknowledge of god he's seen all this
[35:56] happen
[35:58] and could write it in the bible write
[36:00] about a ruth and the boaz and
[36:01] i'm reading in job now and uh
[36:04] and reading about his three best friends
[36:09] yeah they they were uh accusers of the
[36:12] brethren i think
[36:13] they were trying to get job to confess
[36:16] things
[36:16] surely job you did something yeah but
[36:18] see that's how people are but see you
[36:20] see that the same way now
[36:21] uh it's like brother dale was saying
[36:23] this morning you know well that guy's
[36:24] just serpent seed he don't believe like
[36:25] i do well you better be careful
[36:29] touch not mine anointed you would have
[36:30] thought saul would have been serpent
[36:32] seed
[36:33] if we was looking at what saul did i'm
[36:36] talking about big saul
[36:37] the king but he'll be there
[36:40] amen he'll be right there with us he
[36:43] won't be bribed but we know what he'll
[36:44] be he'll be
[36:46] there with the old testament because
[36:47] david said hey touch not mine anointing
[36:50] do my profits no harm and so we just
[36:52] need to be careful
[36:54] and let god do the judging um except
[36:57] us so all right let's look now let's
[37:00] start with passover real quick we're
[37:01] going to go through these because we've
[37:02] been through them before but we need to
[37:04] get them together passover is leviticus
[37:06] 23 verse one
[37:09] and i think brother kearn's back there
[37:10] trying to help with anderson so uh
[37:12] if it's a little bit slow it's okay it's
[37:14] all right we gotta we're an hour early
[37:19] oh boy now we and the lord speaking of
[37:22] people get all nervous when you talk
[37:24] about tithing now and and
[37:26] time getting in here and anyway speaking
[37:29] of the children of israel
[37:30] and say unto them concerning the feast
[37:31] of the lord which you shall proclaim to
[37:34] be holy convocations even these are my
[37:36] feasts so god set these feasts up
[37:39] himself he didn't set them up for
[37:40] and he set them up for herself for them
[37:42] to what worship him
[37:44] six days shall work be done but on the
[37:46] seventh day is the sabbath of rest and
[37:47] holy convocation
[37:49] you shall do no work therein it is the
[37:50] sabbath of the lord and all your
[37:52] dwelling
[37:53] so there's your saturday remember what
[37:56] sunday the first day of the week
[37:59] amen but they took sunday monday tuesday
[38:03] wednesday thursday
[38:04] friday and saturday was their sabbath
[38:06] and sabbath
[38:07] or sabbath means to rest all right so
[38:10] every seven days they had a rest day
[38:12] that didn't include the feast the feasts
[38:14] came in a little bit later
[38:16] all right these are the feasts of the
[38:18] lord and even holy convocations which
[38:20] you shall proclaim
[38:22] in their seasons thereby understand
[38:24] those seasons
[38:25] same way with me and you you come in in
[38:27] your season he that
[38:28] our brother didn't come in last week i
[38:30] mean last year last two years
[38:32] he came in in the season you and i all
[38:34] came in the season
[38:36] that was ripe that the fruit was right
[38:38] for god to harvest
[38:40] everybody got that amen all right so
[38:43] even holy convocations which you shall
[38:44] proclaim in their
[38:46] seasons in the 14th day of the first
[38:49] month
[38:50] what's the first month abib or nissan
[38:53] are march april and the 14th day of the
[38:56] first month at evening is the lord's
[38:58] passover and we saw what you were
[39:00] supposed to do you take the lamb of the
[39:02] first year
[39:03] and it was supposed to be without
[39:05] blemish
[39:06] typing who jesus christ he was the
[39:09] passover lamb he was the one that was
[39:10] going to die
[39:11] but remember that was a temporary blood
[39:13] that they put over the doorpost in egypt
[39:16] when the next rain came just washed it
[39:18] all away but the blood of jesus christ
[39:21] it had it had god involved in it
[39:24] not just an animal blood this was god
[39:26] involved all right
[39:28] so when he shed his blood it's like i
[39:30] love what the prophet said he said
[39:32] there's a little thin
[39:33] red bloodline all the way around the
[39:36] earth that covers the earth
[39:37] where god can hear our voice through
[39:40] that blood
[39:40] if he didn't hear a voice through the
[39:42] blood like the same way with adam and
[39:43] eve like brother dale's talking about
[39:45] they would have died you and i would die
[39:48] we're still sinners saved by grace
[39:50] and the thoughts and the ideas and the
[39:52] things that we do are contrary to god
[39:55] amen so i thank god that that covering
[39:58] is still there you say no
[39:59] i don't need it well yeah you need it
[40:00] every day every day
[40:02] we need that covering every single day
[40:05] just to make it through the day
[40:07] because we do have sins all right
[40:11] we do have unbelief
[40:15] sorry we do just admit it if you admit
[40:19] these things
[40:20] that's why when somebody comes to
[40:23] comes to the lord you just admit you're
[40:25] wrong right
[40:27] i admit i was wrong i and we all every
[40:29] one of us
[40:30] sometimes and you know you do you you
[40:32] feel like maybe you're on an island
[40:34] somewhere that i'm the only one that has
[40:35] did a sin and
[40:36] had a past life and i'm the only one
[40:38] that you know no no brother
[40:40] no no every one of us
[40:44] every one of us even the prophet of god
[40:46] wherever we got the holy ghost either
[40:48] slop jar or
[40:49] pen or or on the railroad track or
[40:51] wherever he was he had an
[40:53] experience where he came and said god
[40:55] i'm tired
[40:56] i'm sick and tired of being sick and
[40:58] tired amen so we all come to that
[41:00] there's none of us ever just walked up
[41:02] and said well i believe this ever since
[41:04] i was like five years old
[41:06] no you're a liar so you need to you need
[41:09] to get that lying spirit off of you
[41:10] first
[41:11] amen so that's why the bible says repent
[41:13] and be baptized that's the problem
[41:14] sometimes we don't get that repent part
[41:16] right
[41:17] we just want to get them to the water
[41:18] well we want to get them repented first
[41:21] amen get them to repent
[41:24] and know that you did the wrong know
[41:26] that we did
[41:28] what we did so but we have a covering
[41:31] amen we have a covering and that
[41:34] covering speaks all down through your
[41:36] life
[41:37] even as we were talking the other day
[41:38] you know brother brown says that we all
[41:41] that believers have angels
[41:42] and and you were born with an angel to
[41:44] protect you why because you were
[41:46] predestinated but by foreknowledge you
[41:48] were predestinated to become a christian
[41:51] i mean you got to get to that brother
[41:53] they will get to that where it is
[41:55] where god did see you come to a place
[41:58] and if he saw you come to that place he
[42:00] can't do anything
[42:02] else but bring it to you at that place
[42:04] amen
[42:05] but it was my foreknowledge that he knew
[42:07] you would want it more than life itself
[42:09] if you ever want this gospel
[42:10] if you ever want the new birth more than
[42:12] life itself god will give it to you
[42:14] amen but if you say well i can't because
[42:17] see there you go into the situation i
[42:19] can't
[42:19] no god can save anybody that wants to
[42:22] that wants to be saved right
[42:24] amen he said well i was pretty
[42:28] well you're predestined to think that
[42:30] too
[42:32] okay so we we we see by foreknowledge
[42:35] that this is what god the children of
[42:38] israel they needed a prophet for
[42:39] instruction
[42:40] an angel to guide them because they
[42:43] didn't know they were going on a 40-year
[42:45] journey
[42:47] god did that's right god knew they were
[42:49] going on a 40-year journey
[42:51] they didn't know that they were just a
[42:52] few days from the promised land
[42:54] but god gave them an angel to guide them
[42:57] pillow fire
[42:58] and a cloud and then he gave them right
[43:00] from the get-go just like
[43:03] before they even sinned one time in the
[43:05] wilderness
[43:06] god give them a lamb give them a blood
[43:08] covering
[43:09] just like he gave adam and eve a blood
[43:12] covering
[43:13] before there was even the foundation of
[43:15] the world he knew he was going to have
[43:17] to come down here and die
[43:18] and shed his blood right so he went
[43:20] ahead in his mind and said okay i'm
[43:22] going to
[43:23] have this plan of redemption and even
[43:27] the children of israel are included in
[43:28] that plan of redemption because they're
[43:30] for our example
[43:32] and then that same children of israel
[43:33] you said same well
[43:35] the the progeny of that children of
[43:37] israel
[43:38] is going to be 144 000 is going to be
[43:40] saved after you and i leave this place
[43:42] so god's not going to forget israel
[43:44] looks like sometimes he did no he's not
[43:45] going to forget israel
[43:47] never will forget israel he said no i ca
[43:50] how can i do that
[43:51] so he's not going to forget her no he's
[43:53] coming together
[43:55] even though they're the ones that put
[43:56] him on the cross physically
[43:59] you and i put him on the cross but
[44:00] physically they said you know
[44:02] let his blood be on us and our children
[44:05] but god's going to take care of them
[44:07] he knows that most of them are not going
[44:09] to make it but they're going to give him
[44:10] a prophet anyway
[44:11] give them a prophet going to give them
[44:13] an angel going to give them a lamb to
[44:15] cover their sins same thing with me and
[44:17] you
[44:18] he's going to give us those three things
[44:21] on our journey
[44:23] and then we see that the next is
[44:25] unleavened bread
[44:27] it says on the 15th day of the same
[44:29] month so it's the next day after the
[44:31] same month on the same month the next
[44:33] day
[44:34] is the feast of unleavened bread seven
[44:37] days you must eat unleavened bread and
[44:38] the first day you'll have a holy
[44:39] convocation
[44:41] you shall do no servile work therein but
[44:44] you shall offer an offering made by fire
[44:46] unto the lord
[44:46] seven days and then the seventh day is a
[44:49] holy
[44:50] convocation you should do no servile
[44:51] work there in now we know that that
[44:53] types the seven church ages
[44:55] i'm just trying to get everybody up
[44:56] speed that types of seven church ages
[44:59] that the first church age was a holy
[45:01] convocation
[45:02] and the last church ages are holy
[45:04] convocation so we've got the holy
[45:05] what we've got to do is is the prophet
[45:08] of god turned us back to the faith of
[45:10] the fathers not to something different
[45:12] but back to the faith of the fathers so
[45:14] then he could
[45:16] really come on guys
[45:19] what kind of journey would we have
[45:20] without the prophet here today what
[45:22] would you be
[45:24] come on where would you be without
[45:27] hearing of this message
[45:29] whether you just heard of it or whether
[45:31] you've been in it since you was a kid
[45:33] what would you be doing yeah you're
[45:35] going to do you're going to go to the
[45:36] methodist and you're going to go to the
[45:38] baptist
[45:39] i can't i can't understand how that you
[45:42] can
[45:42] be exposed to this message and then go
[45:44] somewhere else
[45:46] i just can't see that all right but you
[45:48] know why i can't see that because i
[45:50] believe god's filled me with the holy
[45:51] ghost and if he filled you with the holy
[45:53] ghost you'd have the same faith
[45:54] you can't go back you can't go back
[45:59] listen there's nothing to go back to
[46:02] once you've got the real thing there's
[46:04] nothing there's no substitute to go back
[46:06] to
[46:06] but now a lot of us had to go through
[46:08] those substitutes
[46:10] baptist methods pentecost and and
[46:12] lutheran yeah
[46:14] brother paul's daddy was a lutheran
[46:16] preacher
[46:17] so he grew up lutheran all of his life
[46:19] he bang bang bang yeah i know
[46:22] button heads but he was a lutheran
[46:24] during his life and
[46:25] so he knew about martin luther
[46:29] good guy yeah good guy super guy church
[46:31] age messenger
[46:33] but remember he knows that same way as
[46:36] brother dale knows the baptist faith
[46:38] and then how can you look back to that
[46:40] faith and get anything from it
[46:43] i'm bringing a point to this because how
[46:45] in the world
[46:46] now some of those that were in their
[46:49] journey
[46:50] in the world in the wilderness of sin
[46:53] wanted to go back to egypt
[46:55] but they never got a true revelation so
[46:57] god just let them die
[46:58] but now joshua and caleb never said i
[47:01] think we need to go back
[47:02] no caleb saw a mountain one day
[47:06] and he said that's my mountain and it's
[47:08] not back in egypt
[47:10] it's over in the promised land and i'm
[47:12] going in that direction
[47:14] and and joshua even went into the
[47:16] promised land
[47:17] caleb went into the promised land and
[47:19] came out so
[47:20] same way with you and i you and i are
[47:22] going to go through these feasts
[47:24] during our time of being a christian
[47:27] unleavened bread is what no leaven no
[47:30] added interpretation
[47:34] no added interpretation because leaven
[47:36] is an addition
[47:38] even air is 11.
[47:41] because if you need dough nick k-n-e-a-d
[47:45] not need if you need no need dough and
[47:48] you don't do something with it in 18
[47:49] minutes it begins to rise anyway because
[47:52] air causes the bubbles and the chemical
[47:55] reaction and all that
[47:56] that's why he told them to eat their
[47:58] food in haste and if it was going to be
[48:00] unleavened bread
[48:01] and they ate unleavened bread until the
[48:03] manna fell why they were moving
[48:05] they were patting that bread as fast as
[48:07] they could they were feeding two million
[48:08] people
[48:09] they were patting that bread and
[48:10] sticking it in the oven as fast as they
[48:12] could will it come out like this
[48:15] god said you're going to eat unleavened
[48:16] bread a feast of unleavened bread
[48:19] seven days so during seven church ages
[48:22] even
[48:23] lutheran today like brother brown said i
[48:25] saw him where he was talking about
[48:26] wesley would turn over in his grave if
[48:28] he saw what happened
[48:30] after his message came but now when when
[48:33] martin luther came on the earth
[48:35] he was a messenger for that day he was
[48:38] the truth
[48:39] for that day but now you can't stay in
[48:42] lutheran now
[48:44] and make it you got to keep moving on
[48:47] same way with them you
[48:48] you say well i'm just going to do
[48:49] unleavened bread and i'm going to quit
[48:50] no god required these feasts to be done
[48:53] in order
[48:54] in their season and so he requires me
[48:57] and you to do the same identical thing
[49:00] no leaven among you brother brown says
[49:04] brings the headstone what no false
[49:05] doctrine
[49:07] okay because 11 of the pharisees was
[49:10] their false doctrine
[49:12] but when we get into the feast of
[49:13] pentecost you're going to see god use
[49:15] not unbelief leaven but this is leaven
[49:20] i hope you saw that last sunday uh some
[49:22] of them some real good comments and i
[49:24] i'm going to try to touch on a little
[49:26] bit more than what i did
[49:28] last week on on the feast of pentecost
[49:31] because that's where you bring lebanon
[49:32] and you go what in the world you bring
[49:33] lebanon because in
[49:34] in the feast of unleavened bread that
[49:37] very first day you went through your
[49:39] house you crawled underneath the
[49:41] the furniture you went through all the
[49:44] cabinets
[49:45] because if there was leaven found a
[49:48] little bit further down home
[49:49] if you find i tried to shorten this a
[49:51] little bit but if they found leaven in
[49:53] your house you was cut off from israel
[49:56] you was cut off you couldn't come to no
[49:58] feast you couldn't do anything
[50:00] but if you do this you are offering it
[50:03] to the lord
[50:05] and the first day you'll have a holy
[50:06] convocation and the last day you'll have
[50:08] a
[50:08] holy convocation so we had to get back
[50:11] to the first
[50:12] church age and the way they acted
[50:16] book of acts the way they acted
[50:20] before we could move on so let's go now
[50:21] to exodus 12
[50:23] it says right here seven days shall you
[50:25] eat unleavened bread
[50:27] even the first day you shall put away
[50:29] leaven out of your houses now
[50:31] they had to do it in a physical house
[50:33] you and i have to do it in what house
[50:34] this house right here
[50:36] this is the house we're talking about
[50:37] right here not a physical house
[50:40] because it wouldn't do you any good to
[50:43] go home and say june
[50:44] we got to get rid of all the baking soda
[50:47] and
[50:48] powder and all we got to get rid of all
[50:50] this stuff
[50:51] huh i just i just wouldn't eat there for
[50:54] a while
[50:55] we i i need a bun
[50:59] a bun not a bun i need a bun
[51:03] to eat my hamburger with there you go
[51:05] hey hey man
[51:08] but in this house when you come to
[51:10] church when you press play when you
[51:12] listen to the prophet when you listen to
[51:14] the brothers when you're standing
[51:15] talking
[51:15] what's happened is you're searching for
[51:18] unleavened bread in your house
[51:21] and when you come to a place new brother
[51:23] you come to a place and you say i
[51:25] i don't know about that get it out
[51:28] because you don't want the devil to have
[51:30] place you want to get out you out
[51:32] like the bible tells us he tells us
[51:34] there in luke it says when the unclean
[51:35] spirit goes out
[51:38] now some of us we don't want him to go
[51:40] out too far
[51:42] we just we just wa brother john come on
[51:44] some of us are going
[51:46] now wait a minute i think maybe um i'll
[51:48] just keep
[51:49] no out
[51:52] out unclean spirit goes out of a man
[51:57] i want that thing to walk in dry place i
[52:00] wanted to die
[52:01] because the unclean spirit goes out
[52:03] walks in dry places i wanted to die
[52:06] so that's what's happening in type of
[52:09] because god knew israel could not keep
[52:14] this as me and you keep it to get it out
[52:17] of this house
[52:18] they had nothing to get it out of their
[52:21] their house this house
[52:23] so god said hey physically go into your
[52:26] house and
[52:27] look for leaven any addition
[52:31] get it out for seven days and that was a
[52:34] question
[52:35] where did this lev now remember they use
[52:38] leaven
[52:38] all the time everybody got that
[52:42] they had 11 in the house it was just
[52:44] these seven days
[52:46] they were required to get it out then
[52:49] after the seventh day they could bring
[52:51] it back in and bake because
[52:52] they wanted to bake you know their
[52:54] loaves and all that stuff kind of like
[52:55] us
[52:56] hamburgers i want to eat a cheeseburger
[52:58] with mozza on it
[52:59] i don't want no little cracker on my on
[53:01] my cheeseburger you want cockroach
[53:03] cheeseburger no
[53:04] i'll eat crackers with other stuff but
[53:06] not on my cheeseburger i want some
[53:07] leaven
[53:08] some something to eat but we'll see that
[53:12] when we get to the two loath
[53:14] for whosoever eateth leavened bread from
[53:16] the first day into the seventh day that
[53:18] soul shall be cut off from israel so
[53:20] listen anybody in the church age
[53:23] that took in unleavened bread or our
[53:26] false doctrine they were cut off
[53:32] they were cut off because born-again
[53:35] believers
[53:35] even luther's born-again place in in the
[53:39] in the body of christ it was pure
[53:44] when he said the just shall live by
[53:45] faith that was unleavened bread
[53:48] that was unleavened bread just as much
[53:50] as we say father son holy ghost is not a
[53:52] baptism
[53:53] lord jesus christ is the baptism amen
[53:57] but in luther's time that's all he knew
[54:02] in his seven days though god will put a
[54:05] bride in heaven just by
[54:07] the just shall live by faith because
[54:10] that
[54:10] is unleavened everything else that
[54:13] they've packed into it
[54:15] is living the parts that you do this
[54:17] with that's the
[54:18] that's the leaven part all right so now
[54:21] let's go to the next one first fruits
[54:24] and the lord speak unto moses saying
[54:26] speaking to the children of israel and
[54:27] saying to them when you be coming to the
[54:29] land which i give unto you
[54:30] and shall reap the harvest thereof then
[54:32] you shall bring a sheaf of the first
[54:34] fruits of your harvest
[54:36] unto the priest and he shall wave the
[54:39] sheaf before the lord
[54:41] to be accepted what for you
[54:45] so as i've been talking i want us to
[54:48] understand
[54:50] that brother branham he spent a lot of
[54:53] time talking about headship
[54:56] right that's why he was talking about
[54:57] the girl the ladies should not cut their
[54:59] hair because that's what the bible says
[55:01] it's not because what the prophet said
[55:03] the bible said you shouldn't cut your
[55:04] hair amen
[55:06] and it's a shame and you dishonor your
[55:09] headship
[55:12] come on same way with us
[55:15] our headship is christ ladies don't
[55:19] think that we
[55:20] and i've heard for years preachers
[55:22] beating on women
[55:23] trying to get the women lined up when
[55:26] they needed a lot of it their self
[55:29] amen they needed a lot of lining up
[55:31] theirself because you know what
[55:33] we're all feminists when that man right
[55:34] there looks at us
[55:36] we're all feminist in the body of christ
[55:38] when that man looks at me
[55:40] i'm a bride i'm not a groom
[55:44] that's right i'm a bride so all of us
[55:48] are feminists in the body of christ but
[55:50] because we came down here in flesh and
[55:52] because what eve did in the garden
[55:55] there had to be headship of god or
[55:57] christ
[55:58] the man and the woman a woman can't
[56:01] teach or preach
[56:03] and all these different things and
[56:04] brother brown told us on the um
[56:06] tape the other day about man being the
[56:09] head of the household
[56:10] all right now he's not to be a slave
[56:13] driver
[56:14] but there is headship right there is
[56:17] headship all the way down
[56:18] and it's got to stay that way or you're
[56:20] out of the will of god
[56:22] so here we are we see that what you had
[56:24] to
[56:25] see what am i talking about brother
[56:28] donnie
[56:29] had this field of grain of barley
[56:33] and he jumps out there and grabs the
[56:35] first i'm going to try to stay here
[56:37] because he's
[56:39] brother kern you i told him i tried to
[56:41] stay still
[56:43] but here brother donnie goes out and
[56:45] says well bless god the preacher ain't
[56:46] nowhere around
[56:47] and i really don't need him anyway sorry
[56:50] i'm using you for this
[56:51] i don't need him anyway i'll just go out
[56:53] there and pick the biggest
[56:54] one the first fruits and i'll bring it
[56:56] in and i'll wave it
[56:58] before the lord
[57:02] now you remember two times in the bible
[57:08] aaron's two boys offered strange fire
[57:12] right and they died somebody jumped in
[57:15] and was going to do something
[57:16] make an offering with a shoe bread maybe
[57:18] hezekiah or one of them he turned
[57:19] leprous
[57:21] see you don't go there is a way to
[57:23] approach god so the way to approach god
[57:25] is is donnie says okay
[57:27] i have a high priest and
[57:30] god speaks to me through him right
[57:34] real simple yes amen you know what it
[57:37] takes a lot off for you sisters an
[57:39] awful lot of you brothers that you say
[57:41] well
[57:42] i don't have to preach amen please
[57:47] but donny realizes that so he brings his
[57:50] first fruit
[57:51] to the priest and the priest waves it
[57:57] to be accepted for you
[58:01] that's why christ was the first fruit
[58:02] that's why christ was the first sheep
[58:05] christ was the first wave because what
[58:07] we are accepted
[58:08] in him are chosen in him amen
[58:11] because that wheat came out of the same
[58:14] field
[58:16] that all that other wheat or barley
[58:18] that's fixing to be harvested
[58:20] it was brothers to that but you had to
[58:23] go
[58:24] a certain way that's why we come to
[58:27] church that's why we listen to
[58:28] ministers and while we we have a brother
[58:31] branham on tape and then we have the
[58:33] bible and all these things
[58:34] but he shall wave the sheaf before the
[58:37] lord to be accepted for you
[58:39] on the moral after the sabbath the
[58:41] priest
[58:43] shall wave it and you shall offer that
[58:45] day when you
[58:46] wave the sheaf as in helam without
[58:49] blemish of the first year for a burnt
[58:51] offering unto the lord
[58:52] and the meat offering there shall be two
[58:54] tents deal a fine flour
[58:56] mingled with oil an offering made by
[58:58] fire unto the lord for a sweet savior
[59:00] remember there's three times you do this
[59:02] but we'll not get into that
[59:03] and the drink offering there shall be of
[59:05] wine the fourth part of the hymn
[59:06] and you shall eat neither bread nor
[59:08] parts corn nor green ears until the self
[59:10] same day
[59:11] that you have brought an offering unto
[59:12] your god so like i said before
[59:14] brother donnie couldn't say well i i'm
[59:16] not worried i'm not going to
[59:18] worry about what the preacher says i'm
[59:20] just going to go in here and bake my
[59:22] i'm going to have my own you couldn't
[59:24] even eat
[59:26] if you read even the commentaries you
[59:28] couldn't you could not
[59:29] even harvest that field couldn't touch
[59:32] it
[59:33] until that priest offered it why because
[59:36] of headship
[59:38] you and i we're going to try to save
[59:39] ourselves no we let
[59:41] what jesus christ die for us
[59:44] the only one that could die and come
[59:46] back and then come back into me and you
[59:50] so we we we let him do his job
[59:55] same way with boaz ruth could not do the
[59:58] redeeming
[1:00:00] she had no inheritance she was she
[1:00:03] it was naomi's inheritance right but
[1:00:06] but boaz said today i'll go do it
[1:00:10] i'll redeem and that's what was
[1:00:13] happening
[1:00:14] here the whole field was being redeemed
[1:00:16] or
[1:00:17] able to be used
[1:00:20] able to be used by god when you do it
[1:00:24] the right way
[1:00:29] and you shall eat neither bread and a
[1:00:30] parts corn or green ears until the self
[1:00:32] same day that you have brought an
[1:00:33] offering unto your god it shall be a
[1:00:36] statute
[1:00:37] see you weren't offering it to the
[1:00:38] priest you're offering it to god right
[1:00:41] all right it shall be a statute forever
[1:00:43] throughout your generations
[1:00:45] and all your dwellings so now let's look
[1:00:46] at first corinthians
[1:00:51] what paul said about it if if in this
[1:00:53] life only we have hope in christ where
[1:00:55] of all the men
[1:00:56] most miserable but now is christ risen
[1:01:00] from the dead
[1:01:00] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:01:03] slept he had to be the first one
[1:01:04] up for since by man came death
[1:01:07] by man also came to resurrection what
[1:01:09] man came to death by who adam first
[1:01:12] first adam but by the second adam
[1:01:15] came the resurrection of the dead listen
[1:01:17] adam couldn't die for you
[1:01:21] adam was given rulership but he couldn't
[1:01:22] die for you
[1:01:25] he died but his life is somewhere in
[1:01:28] another dimension
[1:01:30] christ had to come the second adam and
[1:01:32] look it never says and evil die it says
[1:01:34] in adam aldo
[1:01:36] yeah hmm
[1:01:40] so even so in christ shall all be made
[1:01:42] alive
[1:01:44] but every man in his own order you came
[1:01:47] one year
[1:01:47] you came 10 years ago you came 20 years
[1:01:50] ago you came 30 years ago
[1:01:52] you came now but every man in his own
[1:01:55] order
[1:01:55] christ the firstfruits in other words he
[1:01:57] had to do it first
[1:01:59] afterwards they that are christ at his
[1:02:02] coming
[1:02:03] and remember that was a barley harvest
[1:02:07] that we're talking about in first fruits
[1:02:09] that was a barley harvest not a wheat
[1:02:11] harvest
[1:02:11] wheat harvest comes on the day of
[1:02:13] pentecost barley harvest was a cheap
[1:02:15] grain
[1:02:16] or or a little bit less expensive grain
[1:02:19] but
[1:02:20] it was very important because it was the
[1:02:22] first thing to come up you didn't just
[1:02:23] leave it out there and say well no i'm
[1:02:24] going to wait
[1:02:25] i'm going to wait 50 more days no it
[1:02:28] would be ruined by then you harvest
[1:02:30] so christ was the first fruits he was
[1:02:33] the first one to be
[1:02:34] harvested amen
[1:02:38] in the barley harvest and he was the
[1:02:41] first fruit so now let's bring that
[1:02:43] chart up just for a second real quick
[1:02:47] brother anderson thank you so we now we
[1:02:50] see
[1:02:50] that this is the first month of the year
[1:02:52] listen
[1:02:54] all right this is when the passover
[1:02:56] started on the 14th day
[1:02:57] unleavened bread started for seven days
[1:03:00] after that started on the 15th
[1:03:02] we just got on the first fruits which is
[1:03:04] on the morrow
[1:03:05] after the sabbath what's tomorrow after
[1:03:07] the sabbath
[1:03:08] monday sandy
[1:03:15] it wrote right there but tomorrow after
[1:03:19] the sabbath
[1:03:20] then you count that's what we were last
[1:03:23] sunday you count
[1:03:24] seven weeks seven
[1:03:28] sabbaths of weeks seven times seven
[1:03:30] weeks seven times seven days is 49 days
[1:03:33] and then on the 50th day you had a feast
[1:03:36] of weeks or a feast of pentecost
[1:03:39] which penta means
[1:03:43] 50. all right so let's go to that one
[1:03:45] now real quick so there's you hold it
[1:03:47] right there stop
[1:03:48] go back this is your spring feast
[1:03:52] everybody got that same man because it's
[1:03:53] going to be important a little bit later
[1:03:54] this
[1:03:55] is your spring feast christ himself
[1:03:58] was the passover lamb he was his body
[1:04:01] was laying in the grave the very next
[1:04:04] day
[1:04:04] on the feast of unleavened bread then on
[1:04:07] the very day after that which was sunday
[1:04:09] being the first day of the week
[1:04:13] he rose as the first fruit the first one
[1:04:16] to come up out of the grave the first
[1:04:17] sheaf wave
[1:04:19] and now he's going to he promised them
[1:04:22] he said i will return
[1:04:24] in so many days later i'll be
[1:04:28] coming inside of you so all these four
[1:04:31] first four feasts christ had something
[1:04:34] to do with now he's got something to do
[1:04:35] with all these
[1:04:37] but these happen when he's not here
[1:04:41] in his physical form
[1:04:45] but that's got to happen through
[1:04:46] somebody amen so that's what we're going
[1:04:49] to get into the feast of trumpets here
[1:04:51] in a few minutes
[1:04:53] and see what's going on so the feast of
[1:04:54] pentecost i want you to look at the
[1:04:56] different things we're talking about
[1:04:57] here let's go to the feast of pentecost
[1:04:58] now watch
[1:04:59] leviticus 23 15 says and you shall count
[1:05:02] unto you from the moral
[1:05:03] after the sabbath all right
[1:05:07] from the day that you brought the sheaf
[1:05:09] wave offering seven sabbaths so
[1:05:13] the priest was waving the sheaf on
[1:05:15] sunday
[1:05:16] when christ was resurrected all right so
[1:05:19] the moral after the sabbath which was
[1:05:21] that very day
[1:05:22] you count 49 days
[1:05:26] seven sabbaths shall be complete even
[1:05:29] unto the moral after the seventh sabbath
[1:05:32] all right so the day after the seventh
[1:05:34] sabbath would be fifty days
[1:05:38] everybody got that say amen seven seven
[1:05:39] is forty nine and fifty all right
[1:05:41] even until tomorrow after the seventh
[1:05:43] sabbath shall we you number fifty days
[1:05:46] penta penta is fifty pentecost and you
[1:05:49] shall offer a new meat offering
[1:05:52] until the lord this is something new
[1:05:55] it's something never been done before
[1:05:58] this feast of pentecost because what
[1:06:00] you're going to do
[1:06:02] you shall bring out of your habitations
[1:06:05] remember like we're talking last sunday
[1:06:07] this didn't come out of the tabernacle
[1:06:08] this didn't come out of
[1:06:10] out of the priest's office it came it
[1:06:13] came out of your habitation in other
[1:06:14] words where you live
[1:06:17] it came from where you live listen god
[1:06:20] deals with you
[1:06:20] what where you live and where do you
[1:06:23] live oh i live down at 715 herbert no
[1:06:26] right here is where i live that's right
[1:06:28] right here
[1:06:30] and you shall bring out of your
[1:06:31] habitation two wave loaves
[1:06:35] of two-tenths deal now something has
[1:06:36] happened there has been 11
[1:06:39] had been added to this to make a loaf
[1:06:41] everybody got that
[1:06:44] two loaves of two-tenths deal they shall
[1:06:46] be a fine flower they shall be
[1:06:48] bacon with leaven all right so there
[1:06:51] gotta be
[1:06:52] some fire added to it with leaven they
[1:06:55] are the first fruits
[1:06:57] unto the lord and you shall offer with
[1:07:00] the bread
[1:07:01] seven lambs without blemish the first
[1:07:02] year one young bullock two realms
[1:07:04] they shall be for a burnt offering unto
[1:07:06] the lord with a meat offering their
[1:07:08] drink offering even an offering made by
[1:07:10] fire
[1:07:10] of sweet savoring to the lord then you
[1:07:12] shall sacrifice
[1:07:14] one kid of the goats for a sin offering
[1:07:16] and two lambs
[1:07:17] there's a lot of sacrificing being done
[1:07:19] on this day of penta
[1:07:21] cost don't you think the 120 on the day
[1:07:24] of pentecost
[1:07:26] they sacrificed a lot to be there
[1:07:30] and the priest shall wave them with
[1:07:33] the bread of the first fruit so he picks
[1:07:35] the two loaves up
[1:07:38] that you bring he picks the two loaves
[1:07:41] up and he waves them before the lord
[1:07:44] everybody got that say amen all right
[1:07:48] for a wave offering before the lord with
[1:07:50] the two lambs they shall be
[1:07:52] be holy to the lord
[1:07:55] for the priest now watch
[1:08:01] you see the sheaf wave
[1:08:04] now turns into a loaf of bread
[1:08:08] you had to you had to learn this
[1:08:09] remember this is a wheat harvest this is
[1:08:11] not a barley harvest this is a
[1:08:13] wheat harvest right all right you say
[1:08:16] how can we be more
[1:08:17] listen the reason you and i are more
[1:08:19] important than christ
[1:08:21] oh my lord
[1:08:24] he can't do this without us but he chose
[1:08:27] that we didn't
[1:08:29] he chose he wasn't going to do it
[1:08:30] because remember he's a father
[1:08:32] he's going to have children and having
[1:08:34] children he had to bring us in flesh
[1:08:38] amen he had to bring the loaves into
[1:08:41] being
[1:08:42] he had to know that there was leaving
[1:08:44] leaven coming
[1:08:46] and listen watch this
[1:08:50] god added leaven
[1:08:54] to itself not false doctrine we're not
[1:08:56] talking about false doctrine now
[1:08:59] we're talking about leaven that goes in
[1:09:00] a to bake a loaf of bread
[1:09:03] everybody got that in john 1 verse 14
[1:09:06] john 1 1 says in the beginning was the
[1:09:08] word word was god and the word was god
[1:09:10] spirit god right amen like our brother
[1:09:13] dale's talking about today
[1:09:15] but now go down to john 1 14 there was
[1:09:17] an edition
[1:09:20] and the word was made flesh
[1:09:24] and dwelt among us amen now god knew
[1:09:28] when he put adam and eve
[1:09:30] in flesh they were going to fall but he
[1:09:32] used he used that
[1:09:36] for redemption listen god don't hate
[1:09:40] that you got flesh on you today
[1:09:43] hello we might because we're getting
[1:09:46] older
[1:09:47] got aches and pains but god never said
[1:09:49] well now i'm just going to throw them
[1:09:50] away and start over again no he used
[1:09:52] that all down through time
[1:09:54] amen he knew that he was going to come
[1:09:57] back
[1:09:57] in your flesh in my flesh on the day of
[1:10:00] pentecost
[1:10:02] and start a process of leavening
[1:10:06] where he's going to enter because look
[1:10:08] watch this
[1:10:11] he came spirit
[1:10:16] to flesh right everybody got that say
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] he came spirit to flesh
[1:10:24] so he came purity now he wasn't impure
[1:10:28] we know that but his body was not
[1:10:30] eternal
[1:10:32] everybody got that gonna be slow right
[1:10:34] here his body was not eternal
[1:10:36] he had to come down here and die like me
[1:10:38] and you so he had to get into the same
[1:10:40] loaf of bread
[1:10:42] that you were born in amen
[1:10:45] because you and i were born leaven and
[1:10:48] now he's trying to get the leaven out of
[1:10:50] us
[1:10:51] that's why brother brown tells us in
[1:10:53] conjunction and doctrine christ in the
[1:10:54] bride
[1:10:55] there's your two lows they both rise
[1:10:59] christ had to rise first and then we
[1:11:02] rise with him but
[1:11:03] we started in flesh
[1:11:06] and we're headed because watch what did
[1:11:09] jesus say
[1:11:10] he said leave the wheat and tares alone
[1:11:17] we're going back to wheat this is what
[1:11:20] mom and daddy brought
[1:11:23] but it's going to be changed because the
[1:11:25] harvest is not a harvest of a loaf of
[1:11:27] bread
[1:11:28] the harvest is a wheat harvest when god
[1:11:32] says
[1:11:32] to says hey leave them alone let the
[1:11:34] angels go through and stick the sickle
[1:11:36] in
[1:11:37] and put the wheat in the garner and
[1:11:40] burn the tares so god had to come down
[1:11:44] here
[1:11:45] in leaven so that we can take our living
[1:11:48] and take it right back to him amen amen
[1:11:52] so he's he doesn't hate this thing i i
[1:11:55] told you before this thing doesn't sin
[1:11:59] it don't sin it's a product of sin
[1:12:01] that's right amen
[1:12:02] this thing right here has never sinned a
[1:12:04] day in its life if you'll see it the way
[1:12:06] i see it
[1:12:08] you say no i drank beer no that was you
[1:12:10] inside that did that because the same
[1:12:12] guy that
[1:12:15] same guy that drunk the beer god didn't
[1:12:16] take your hand off and throw it away and
[1:12:18] bring
[1:12:18] a new one no he changed the guy inside
[1:12:22] and used the same loaf of bread oh
[1:12:25] come on people he used the same loaf of
[1:12:27] bread
[1:12:28] to fulfill his plan
[1:12:34] and leaven is a raising agent a rising
[1:12:37] a raised
[1:12:41] well if it don't excite you then that's
[1:12:42] okay because you know what jesus didn't
[1:12:45] say i'm the wheat of life jesus never
[1:12:46] said i am the
[1:12:47] barley of life jesus said i am the
[1:12:50] bread of life so there was something
[1:12:52] added in there brother john
[1:12:54] it wasn't that he was this yeah sure we
[1:12:56] know he the words he spoke was
[1:12:59] unleavened the words he spoke
[1:13:02] was pure and unadulterated unleavened
[1:13:05] bread
[1:13:06] but he was standing god almighty
[1:13:10] eternal god standing in human
[1:13:13] leavened flesh because it was an
[1:13:15] addition to
[1:13:17] what he was before
[1:13:22] but when he came back on the day of
[1:13:23] pentecost he said hey
[1:13:26] i was a loaf one time before now i'm
[1:13:29] going to go into them
[1:13:30] and i'm going to change them in a moment
[1:13:34] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:13:36] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:13:38] sound
[1:13:40] oh we haven't got any of the trumpets
[1:13:41] yet okay so anyway
[1:13:46] i am the bread of life you know what he
[1:13:47] was doing he was standing there saying
[1:13:49] i am god in human flesh
[1:13:52] i am god in that loaf
[1:13:57] and you know what when he came back on
[1:13:59] the day of pentecost paul should have
[1:14:01] stood up and said
[1:14:02] and i mean peter should have stood up
[1:14:03] and said i
[1:14:05] am god in human flesh
[1:14:09] hmm you say that's too close no john 1
[1:14:12] 14 speaks to me and you
[1:14:14] speaks to me and you as much as it
[1:14:15] speaks of jesus christ
[1:14:17] and the word was made flesh are you not
[1:14:19] the word now that you're born again
[1:14:20] you're the word you're the word made
[1:14:22] flesh
[1:14:22] it just took your time remember the
[1:14:26] spirit was made flesh in jesus's
[1:14:30] part because he was before you and i
[1:14:33] were not before
[1:14:35] remember brother dale keeps telling us
[1:14:36] we were nothing we were not spirits we
[1:14:38] weren't we had no
[1:14:40] we had no mind of what we were
[1:14:43] i mean how many of y'all can i can't
[1:14:46] remember when i was five well
[1:14:48] i can't remember a couple days ago
[1:14:49] sometimes but i
[1:14:51] but i mean really i mean you can't
[1:14:54] remember it's just a fog
[1:14:57] but jesus christ when he came human
[1:14:59] flesh he said before abraham was
[1:15:02] i am he said if he if you talk to him
[1:15:05] you're gonna have to talk to me
[1:15:10] so what he done he came spirit to flesh
[1:15:13] to take our flesh
[1:15:15] change our spirit and then put them
[1:15:18] together
[1:15:19] because remember here's the key you
[1:15:21] can't
[1:15:22] unless unleavened bread
[1:15:27] did i say that right
[1:15:31] okay in other words once you add 11
[1:15:35] you can't take it out same way with a
[1:15:38] with a the pickling process you know you
[1:15:41] start with a cucumber
[1:15:43] start with a cucumber and once it's
[1:15:46] turned into a pickle
[1:15:47] it can't be turned back into a cucumber
[1:15:50] so once you get born again
[1:15:52] you can't be put back into what you were
[1:15:54] before
[1:15:55] no you've been changed your change
[1:15:58] started the day you received the new
[1:15:59] birth not something that
[1:16:01] it's just gonna be we're gonna walk into
[1:16:04] that
[1:16:06] we're all a bunch of pickles anyway
[1:16:10] so all right let's go pentecost let's
[1:16:12] read this commentary
[1:16:14] that we saw out of the greek lexicon
[1:16:16] pentecost means the 50th day or harvest
[1:16:18] feast
[1:16:20] what am i saying listen god does not
[1:16:22] have a problem
[1:16:23] with your leaven when he's talking about
[1:16:27] this
[1:16:28] your leaven that he don't like is the
[1:16:30] one that's the ones that's up here
[1:16:33] this is your addition to listen you
[1:16:36] can't undo your flesh
[1:16:38] how many of you got here because you
[1:16:40] wanted to get here
[1:16:42] no you got here because
[1:16:45] well anyway had nothing to do with it
[1:16:50] but now once you got here you got
[1:16:51] something to do with it
[1:16:55] pentecost means the 50th day or harvest
[1:16:57] feast or feast of weeks
[1:16:58] maybe be regarded as a supplement to the
[1:17:00] passover it lasted for but
[1:17:03] one day because the next day wouldn't
[1:17:06] have been the 50th day
[1:17:08] pretty simple from the 16th of nissan
[1:17:10] seven weeks were reckoned inclusively
[1:17:12] and an extra 50th day was the day of
[1:17:13] pentecost
[1:17:14] which fell on the sixth of savannah
[1:17:16] which is somewhere in the end of may
[1:17:18] the pentecost was the jewish harvest
[1:17:20] home and the people were especially
[1:17:21] exhorted to rejoice before jehovah with
[1:17:24] their families
[1:17:24] their servants the levites within their
[1:17:27] gets
[1:17:28] that pentecost was including everybody
[1:17:30] listen god would
[1:17:31] give every person the baptism of a holy
[1:17:33] ghost on that day if they would have
[1:17:34] accepted it
[1:17:35] right but only 120
[1:17:38] was promised to go tarry up in jerusalem
[1:17:42] and stay there until you be endued with
[1:17:44] power
[1:17:45] from on high or dunamis from on high all
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:48] and then there was 3 000 little jesus is
[1:17:50] born after that sermon was preached
[1:17:52] but this is for everybody families
[1:17:56] it says to what to you and your children
[1:17:58] and to them that are far off even as
[1:18:00] many of the lord our god shall call
[1:18:02] the servants the levites within their
[1:18:04] gate the stranger
[1:18:06] the fatherless the widow in the place
[1:18:09] chosen by god for his name as they
[1:18:12] brought a freewill offering
[1:18:14] of their hand to jehovah their god what
[1:18:17] was the free will offering
[1:18:18] the 120 in the upper room the free will
[1:18:20] offering was their self
[1:18:22] they took their loaf of bread up into
[1:18:24] the upper room
[1:18:26] made from the first fruits of the wheat
[1:18:28] harvest i'm sorry the great feature
[1:18:30] of the celebration was the presentation
[1:18:32] of two loaves
[1:18:33] made from the first fruits of the wheat
[1:18:35] harvest with the lowe's two lambs were
[1:18:38] offered as a peace offering
[1:18:39] and all were waived before before
[1:18:41] jehovah given to the priest
[1:18:43] the loaves being leavened could not be
[1:18:46] offered on the altar
[1:18:47] the other sacrifices were so in other
[1:18:49] words it had to come out of your
[1:18:50] habitation
[1:18:51] all right and as you keep on going we'll
[1:18:53] not read the rest of it
[1:18:55] but down at the bottom it's really nice
[1:18:57] to know that the interval
[1:18:59] is still regarded as a religious season
[1:19:01] the pentecost is the only one of the
[1:19:02] three great feasts which is not
[1:19:04] mentioned as a memorial event in the
[1:19:05] history of the jew
[1:19:06] but it's so significant that it was on
[1:19:09] the 50th day
[1:19:10] that god came down that sound familiar
[1:19:14] with the sound of a mighty russian wind
[1:19:17] and went to mount sinai
[1:19:19] and gave moses the ten commandments for
[1:19:21] them to live by
[1:19:22] didn't god come down with the sound of a
[1:19:25] mighty rushing wind
[1:19:26] to your mountain and give you the holy
[1:19:28] ghost to what
[1:19:29] so you can live by all right and sinai
[1:19:32] their consecration to him as a nation
[1:19:35] was complete all right brother brown
[1:19:37] says let's read these two quotes
[1:19:40] let's not show from the beginning and
[1:19:43] what happened was look
[1:19:44] they left jesus right down here they
[1:19:47] left jesus at the feast of pentecost
[1:19:49] now this is a natural happening they all
[1:19:50] went to jerusalem they took jesus the
[1:19:53] young 13 year old kid
[1:19:54] they took jesus with him with them
[1:19:58] and they went to jerusalem well they
[1:19:59] headed back to their
[1:20:01] to their house and they lost jesus
[1:20:06] and brother brown was telling them
[1:20:08] showing where they lost him they lost
[1:20:10] him
[1:20:10] at the feast of pentecost you can't find
[1:20:13] them searching
[1:20:13] through creeds and denominations
[1:20:15] denominations and creeds
[1:20:17] all should go back to the beginning now
[1:20:19] let's go to the next one
[1:20:21] questions and answers prophet of god
[1:20:23] said and read oh there was a great time
[1:20:24] going on now when the day of pentecost
[1:20:26] was fully come they were all with one
[1:20:28] mind and one mind believing that god was
[1:20:30] going to send that promise
[1:20:32] and let every person in here get in that
[1:20:34] same mind tonight
[1:20:35] and see what takes place it's got to
[1:20:37] repeat it's a promise
[1:20:39] just the same as they had so see we
[1:20:43] don't have a day of pentecost
[1:20:45] a day on the calendar you and i are
[1:20:47] gentiles
[1:20:49] you you don't receive you don't have to
[1:20:50] wait until the
[1:20:52] whatever day that was of savant to get
[1:20:55] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:57] no you're in a every day
[1:21:02] it's a promise just the same as they
[1:21:04] have that any day you can receive the
[1:21:05] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:07] you don't have to wait till a certain
[1:21:08] day then we see in the book of acts
[1:21:12] and we see the promise and when the day
[1:21:13] of pentecost was fully come
[1:21:17] they were all one mind or all one accord
[1:21:19] in one place and suddenly there came a
[1:21:20] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[1:21:22] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:21:23] they were sitting
[1:21:26] and there appeared under them cloven
[1:21:27] tongues like as a fire it set on each of
[1:21:29] them
[1:21:30] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:21:31] ghost and began to speak with other
[1:21:33] tongues as the spirit gave utterance
[1:21:35] and there was dwellers in jerusalem jews
[1:21:37] devout men out of every nation everybody
[1:21:39] come into this great feast of pentecost
[1:21:41] and while they were having their great
[1:21:43] feast and they were presenting the two
[1:21:45] loaves
[1:21:46] christ was coming down going into those
[1:21:48] loaves that were up here in the upper
[1:21:50] room
[1:21:50] and he was saying to find listen that's
[1:21:53] where christianity began
[1:21:56] right there is when god came down and
[1:21:58] said i'm only one man
[1:22:02] and i'm confined in this loaf of bread
[1:22:06] but when i take it back to the father
[1:22:08] and i come back in spirit form
[1:22:11] i'm going to get into all these loaves
[1:22:15] and i'm going to send you out and we're
[1:22:18] recipients today
[1:22:21] we are recipients today of that
[1:22:24] now when this was noise abroad the
[1:22:26] multitude tank came together and we're
[1:22:27] confounded because
[1:22:29] every man heard them speak in their own
[1:22:30] language they were all amazed and
[1:22:32] marveled saying one to the other
[1:22:34] behold are not these which speak
[1:22:36] galileans
[1:22:37] and now here we every man in our own
[1:22:39] tongue
[1:22:40] wherein we were born
[1:22:43] amen so there's the day of pentecost to
[1:22:46] me it was a very important day
[1:22:48] but what happens to though is you got to
[1:22:50] remember
[1:22:52] from the day of pentecost to the next to
[1:22:54] the feast of trumpets
[1:22:55] there's several months in there because
[1:22:58] you got to go all the way to the seventh
[1:22:59] month you got to go from like the third
[1:23:01] month to the seventh month
[1:23:02] you got to go from the first church age
[1:23:05] to the last church
[1:23:06] age of the filling of the holy ghost
[1:23:08] because there's been a day of pentecost
[1:23:09] every time somebody gets born again
[1:23:10] they've been a day of pentecost
[1:23:13] because he fills you the same as the way
[1:23:14] he filled them
[1:23:16] now you may have a different reaction
[1:23:18] than they did which is fine and dandy
[1:23:19] that's
[1:23:20] okay but that's the way they received it
[1:23:25] and how we hear every man our own tongue
[1:23:26] we're in we were born now let's go to
[1:23:28] the feast of trumpets
[1:23:32] now remember this is the feast of
[1:23:34] trumpets this is not the trumpets of
[1:23:35] revelations
[1:23:38] 8 and 9. everybody got that
[1:23:41] but it does have something to do with it
[1:23:43] because pull that chart up just for a
[1:23:44] second if you don't mind brother
[1:23:46] anderson boys quick got them spider arms
[1:23:49] working out there
[1:23:53] right here is the first four feast the
[1:23:55] spring feast that we've been in right
[1:23:57] here
[1:23:59] now you and i when we accept the
[1:24:02] passover
[1:24:05] unleavened bread we're we're now driving
[1:24:08] out
[1:24:09] the 11 as far as false doctrine
[1:24:13] first fruits is what we present
[1:24:15] ourselves to the lord
[1:24:18] okay then on the day of pentecost
[1:24:22] that lord comes in the lord of the
[1:24:23] harvest comes into our heart
[1:24:25] okay on the day of pentecost the feast
[1:24:27] of weeks
[1:24:30] and we received the baptism of the holy
[1:24:31] ghost and now look
[1:24:35] excuse me
[1:24:39] us not the jews us
[1:24:42] we're going through the seven church
[1:24:43] ages we have already have the baptism of
[1:24:46] the holy ghost right
[1:24:48] we've already got it the jews don't have
[1:24:50] it yet
[1:24:51] everybody got that say amen the 144
[1:24:54] thousand are waiting to get this
[1:24:56] all right and we may stop right here
[1:24:58] because i don't want to go too long
[1:25:00] we finish it wednesday night
[1:25:04] they don't get pentecost yet
[1:25:07] right they don't receive the holy ghost
[1:25:09] listen they turned all this down
[1:25:12] literally they're doing these all right
[1:25:14] literally over there they're they're
[1:25:16] having these little dinners and eatings
[1:25:17] and all that stuff for all these years
[1:25:20] because if they would have accepted
[1:25:22] jesus christ right here
[1:25:24] see we wouldn't had this day
[1:25:27] we gentiles that's right because they
[1:25:31] would accepted christ
[1:25:32] and that'd been it but they didn't they
[1:25:34] turned him down
[1:25:35] at the first feast everybody with me
[1:25:39] all right so they don't yeah sure
[1:25:41] they're doing it they're eating
[1:25:42] unleavened bread
[1:25:43] but they don't i don't say they don't
[1:25:45] have a clue
[1:25:47] but why do you think they're still doing
[1:25:48] this over there they're wanting christ
[1:25:50] to come
[1:25:51] their messiah hasn't got here yet they
[1:25:53] think but the messiah's got here for us
[1:25:56] all right so we go through this we know
[1:25:59] that
[1:26:00] jesus died for our sins we know that
[1:26:02] we're supposed to get all the
[1:26:04] false doctrine out of our out of our
[1:26:07] life
[1:26:08] and that we give ourself as a first
[1:26:10] fruit like i said a tithing
[1:26:11] when you come to church it's not that
[1:26:13] you pay your tithe
[1:26:15] which is according to the bible you
[1:26:17] should but you give your time
[1:26:19] your tithe of your time all right you're
[1:26:21] giving the first fruits to the lord
[1:26:25] and then guess what one day you come to
[1:26:28] a day of pentecost
[1:26:30] where that jesus christ that died for
[1:26:33] you
[1:26:33] came into your heart and then now we've
[1:26:36] lived through all these church ages
[1:26:37] and then now you and i are recipients of
[1:26:40] this
[1:26:42] we'll talk about in just a minute or
[1:26:44] maybe we'll stop right here and get in
[1:26:46] because the feast of trumpets is what
[1:26:47] it's a sound
[1:26:52] the day of atonement is not calling you
[1:26:54] to kill a lamb again
[1:26:57] it's calling you to remember
[1:27:01] that a lamb died for you okay
[1:27:04] and then brother brown says we are now
[1:27:06] feasting under the feast of what
[1:27:08] tabernacles which is the last harvest
[1:27:11] feast
[1:27:16] we're not going to go build a booth and
[1:27:17] go live in it and be holy
[1:27:19] this is the booth he's wanting to live
[1:27:21] in and that's what we're living under
[1:27:23] that we're realizing
[1:27:25] because what they do i'm getting a
[1:27:27] little ahead of myself but i want you to
[1:27:28] see the whole picture
[1:27:29] they're realizing that
[1:27:33] they're gonna go build a booth out in
[1:27:35] their yard and live in it for seven days
[1:27:38] to show that they journeyed through
[1:27:40] israel and they didn't have their own
[1:27:41] house they lived in
[1:27:43] out in the wilderness you and i
[1:27:47] we know where the last tabernacle is
[1:27:49] listen there's going to be a tabernacle
[1:27:51] built in the millennium brother
[1:27:53] paul and i were talking about that the
[1:27:54] millennial temple we won't build it
[1:27:58] we don't know how to build temples we
[1:28:01] know how to build castles but we don't
[1:28:02] know how to build temples
[1:28:04] so they'll build the temple but now
[1:28:06] watch this so what's going to happen is
[1:28:08] is we're going to leave all right
[1:28:12] we're getting we'll do the feast of
[1:28:13] trumpets later we'll do it next
[1:28:14] wednesday
[1:28:15] because i want you to get this real
[1:28:16] quick this is what i'm heading to but if
[1:28:18] i don't tell you now
[1:28:21] just feels like everything's boring
[1:28:23] today i don't know we'll see
[1:28:26] but see the messiah returns and takes us
[1:28:28] out of the way
[1:28:29] then what happens to natural israel
[1:28:35] don't they get the holy ghost don't they
[1:28:38] have to realize that that passover lamb
[1:28:40] was the literal jesus christ
[1:28:42] amen and that they got to get what's
[1:28:44] going to happen is they're going to get
[1:28:46] all that orthodox jew
[1:28:47] out of them
[1:28:50] i think this is what's going to happen i
[1:28:52] have an opinion
[1:28:54] no that's not an opinion god don't have
[1:28:56] an opinion god's god
[1:28:58] you either believe his word or you don't
[1:29:01] then
[1:29:01] they're going to offer themselves to the
[1:29:03] lord but watch what happens when they
[1:29:04] get the holy ghost
[1:29:06] we'll read it later the trumpet sound
[1:29:10] see you've got to have a feast of the
[1:29:11] trumpets they're coming to the feast of
[1:29:13] trumpets
[1:29:14] but they don't understand that it's
[1:29:15] going to be
[1:29:17] the seven trumpets because remember the
[1:29:20] seven trumpets
[1:29:21] is not to us brother brown said he
[1:29:23] preached him supernaturally under the
[1:29:24] sixth seal which what is the sixth seal
[1:29:26] two witnesses revealing israel jesus
[1:29:30] christ
[1:29:31] and then they call the plagues down on
[1:29:32] the earth well what happens right here
[1:29:35] they don't they don't kill jesus christ
[1:29:37] again they're not they're waiting on the
[1:29:39] messiah to come
[1:29:40] so that he can die for him they're going
[1:29:43] to realize on this day of atonement
[1:29:45] he already died for him 2 000 years ago
[1:29:47] and that's where it in
[1:29:48] in zechariah or somewhere it says we'll
[1:29:51] turn and mourn
[1:29:53] we'll we'll oh we killed our messiah a
[1:29:56] long time ago
[1:29:57] that's their day of atonement when you a
[1:29:59] day of atonement is
[1:30:01] that you realize something died for you
[1:30:03] they haven't realized that yet
[1:30:05] and then what's going to happen they're
[1:30:07] going to take a rapture the messiah is
[1:30:08] going to return to them
[1:30:10] and going to take them in a rapture
[1:30:13] so see there's your feast but we'll get
[1:30:16] into each one of them but
[1:30:18] they're literally going through these
[1:30:20] feasts
[1:30:22] and if you look in the commentary
[1:30:26] it's a natural eating of something
[1:30:28] they've just made it like a
[1:30:30] and god forgive me like a buffet you
[1:30:32] know
[1:30:33] now the jews get together and and you
[1:30:35] know if if you and i are jewish we get
[1:30:37] our
[1:30:38] families together and we eat a meal
[1:30:41] under all this they're symbols and all
[1:30:43] these things that go
[1:30:45] with it but they just don't know you and
[1:30:47] i spiritually have went
[1:30:49] going through every one of these but
[1:30:52] they're going to have to come to a day
[1:30:53] where they're going to
[1:30:55] sit down and realize
[1:30:58] they've went through all these too god's
[1:31:01] not forgotten
[1:31:03] they're gonna make right here
[1:31:08] they're gonna take a harvest
[1:31:12] that's the last harvest of the year
[1:31:17] and it's a fruit harvest
[1:31:20] you've already been a wheat now
[1:31:24] your fruit your
[1:31:28] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:31:30] godliness brotherly kindness
[1:31:33] he's going to harvest your fruit right
[1:31:36] here
[1:31:37] and he's going to harvest their fruit
[1:31:38] same time
[1:31:40] they're going to realize on this day of
[1:31:41] atonement they're going to say where did
[1:31:44] you get those scars
[1:31:46] and he's going to say drop back over
[1:31:49] here
[1:31:50] in the house of my friends and then
[1:31:53] they're going to what they're going to
[1:31:54] mourn and separate because you know what
[1:31:56] they've realized
[1:31:57] their messiah had come and they didn't
[1:31:59] know it right
[1:32:00] and they're mourning that god's going to
[1:32:02] destroy him but he says no no no
[1:32:06] i did this for your preservation
[1:32:10] but i also did this for 2 000 years i
[1:32:13] was bringing a bride
[1:32:15] i was bringing the gentiles in i've got
[1:32:18] her in and she's already in glory and
[1:32:20] she's safe
[1:32:22] and now i'm coming back to you and i'm
[1:32:24] going to give you safety 144
[1:32:26] 000. we're going to have a feast of
[1:32:29] trumpets there's going to be
[1:32:30] seven trumpets that sound all these
[1:32:32] different plagues but you and i don't
[1:32:34] see that
[1:32:36] but they do so let's stand our feet god
[1:32:37] bless you
[1:32:39] we'll get to the feast of trumpets
[1:32:41] because there's more to that
[1:32:43] several other things to that
[1:32:47] i just didn't get there fast enough
[1:32:50] we're slow down here we're inside our
[1:32:52] nurse
[1:32:57] all the musicians come on because
[1:33:00] remember
[1:33:02] brother brown preached when the trumpet
[1:33:06] gives an uncertain sound
[1:33:09] there's a scripture that that we're
[1:33:10] going to read in ezekiel
[1:33:14] i'll just read it to him we'll read it
[1:33:15] again this is how important it is to
[1:33:17] hear the correct word of god
[1:33:20] ezekiel 33 verse 2 says son of man speak
[1:33:22] to the children of thy people and say
[1:33:24] unto them
[1:33:25] when i bring the sword upon a land if
[1:33:28] the people of the land take a man of
[1:33:30] their coast
[1:33:31] and set him for their watchmen watch if
[1:33:34] then he seeth the
[1:33:36] sword come upon the land he blow the
[1:33:38] trumpet and warn the people
[1:33:40] then whosoever heareth the sound of the
[1:33:42] trumpet and taketh not warning
[1:33:45] if the sword come and take him away the
[1:33:47] blood will be upon his own head
[1:33:51] but but
[1:33:55] he heard the sound of the trumpet and
[1:33:57] took not warning his blood shall be upon
[1:33:59] him
[1:34:00] but he that taketh warning shall deliver
[1:34:04] his soul but if the watchmen see the
[1:34:06] sword come and blow not the trumpet
[1:34:08] what are you saying brother wade you
[1:34:10] better be listening to the right word
[1:34:12] because there's a watchman that's been
[1:34:13] given and if he blows the trumpet and
[1:34:16] said the enemy's coming or the enemy
[1:34:18] is here or we need to quit doing this
[1:34:19] and we need to quit doing it and we
[1:34:21] don't heed that
[1:34:22] then the blood's on us not on the
[1:34:24] watchmen
[1:34:26] so we'll read that wednesday night
[1:34:30] we'll still be on the feast of trumpets
[1:34:31] god bless you love you with the love of
[1:34:33] the lord just remember
[1:34:34] wednesday and sunday it will be these uh
[1:34:37] men only
[1:34:38] and sister esther playing the piano so
[1:34:41] be diligent um
[1:34:44] like i said brother bob brother luis
[1:34:46] they're feeling a whole lot better
[1:34:48] and uh we'll keep up with them um
[1:34:52] sister adam and brother al but uh god
[1:34:55] bless you
[1:34:57] just be diligent just be diligent be
[1:34:59] watchful
[1:35:00] well i said that watchman that god gives
[1:35:02] you a watchman called the baptism of the
[1:35:04] holy ghost
[1:35:05] all right and when you feel that little
[1:35:07] check you better be careful
[1:35:09] i do that a lot even on my mail route
[1:35:11] and you think well this is so simple but
[1:35:12] you just don't know
[1:35:14] because see i've got 600 boxes and it's
[1:35:16] a it's a hard surface
[1:35:19] and they say the buyers can live so i
[1:35:20] mean whatever but i wear gloves
[1:35:23] but you know there's times when i'll
[1:35:24] i'll literally be sitting there
[1:35:26] and looking at the box and something say
[1:35:29] sanitize your hands
[1:35:34] but it won't do that for another 200
[1:35:35] boxes or whatever that but
[1:35:38] stop sanitize your hands and i'll grab
[1:35:40] that
[1:35:41] hand sanitizer no give it a good one and
[1:35:43] keep on going well god's protecting me
[1:35:45] so far so
[1:35:46] but you listen to that still small voice
[1:35:49] that watchman that god gave you
[1:35:51] yes because remember you don't want to
[1:35:55] listen to a trumpet that has an
[1:35:56] uncertain sound
[1:35:58] if it gives an uncertain sound what do
[1:36:00] you do i mean there's
[1:36:02] there wasn't communications back then
[1:36:04] like they are now but back then you know
[1:36:06] the charge was one
[1:36:07] um node and and retreat was one note and
[1:36:10] moved to the left was another you could
[1:36:12] really get your voice out there
[1:36:15] and what if the guy messed up and was
[1:36:17] supposed to retreat
[1:36:18] and he blew the charge trumpet
[1:36:22] disaster what am i saying you need to
[1:36:24] know what you're hearing you need to
[1:36:26] know where you're going you need to know
[1:36:27] what's going on
[1:36:28] and you need to listen to that certain
[1:36:31] sound
[1:36:32] that that trumpet gives you let's sing a
[1:36:33] song god bless you
[1:36:36] for her
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:37:04] is
[1:37:11] brother david is going for a brain scan
[1:37:14] on tuesday and we're going to pray

[1:37:32] and we see things lord and people's
[1:37:34] lives change because of it even cancer

[1:37:51] doctors but we know that you are the
[1:37:53] only healer
[1:37:54] you are the healer the great physician
[1:37:58] and we pray that you would bless our
[1:37:59] little brother lord and all will be well
[1:38:01] in jesus name we pray
[1:38:02] amen so christ
[1:38:06] is lord say it one more time
[1:38:17] oh he is lord
[1:38:23] he has risen from
[1:38:27] the dead and
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:40] every trump
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:55] you know what about a a message
[1:38:58] brother paul i told him many times
[1:39:00] before
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:03] the bible says every knee shall bow
[1:39:06] and every tongue shall confess
[1:39:10] in other words whether you want to or
[1:39:11] not
[1:39:13] you're going to bow
[1:39:16] why not do it and know what you're
[1:39:19] bowing for
[1:39:20] because there's a lot of people going to
[1:39:22] bow
[1:39:23] and they ain't going to be very nice it
[1:39:26] ain't going to be very nice for them
[1:39:27] but if you and i will submit ourselves
[1:39:29] to god
[1:39:31] kneel down and pray and know that he's
[1:39:34] your lord there's your headship
[1:39:37] but i'm telling you you can give me any
[1:39:40] there's many mighty revelations in this
[1:39:42] in this message but i can count one
[1:39:47] and those of you that know what i'm
[1:39:48] going to say i can count one revelation
[1:39:51] that i think more than any revelation is
[1:39:55] that brother paul i don't have to go
[1:39:56] through tribulation
[1:39:58] i don't have to stand before the
[1:40:00] judgment bar
[1:40:03] i don't have to i'm chosen in him
[1:40:08] and if he don't have to stand in front
[1:40:10] of it i don't have to stand in front of
[1:40:12] it
[1:40:13] the bible tells us that the book was
[1:40:15] open there was thrones
[1:40:17] thrones thrones
[1:40:22] thrones don't you know the saints will
[1:40:25] judge the earth
[1:40:28] how can you stand in judgment
[1:40:31] and be a judge you can't
[1:40:34] i've been judged and thank god the
[1:40:36] prophet of god many many times
[1:40:38] because there's people listening baptist
[1:40:40] they don't know about the lutheran but
[1:40:41] the baptist says look you're going
[1:40:42] through seven years of tribulation
[1:40:44] and you're gonna have to go before
[1:40:46] before the white throne judgment and
[1:40:47] you're gonna have to do all this you
[1:40:49] ah brother brown said look how can god
[1:40:52] send his own bride
[1:40:55] how can you take your own wife and send
[1:40:58] her into tribulation
[1:41:01] no he took on our sin
[1:41:04] so that our loaf will be just as
[1:41:06] righteous as his loaf
[1:41:08] and their stands amen the great
[1:41:11] righteous judge but look at all the ones
[1:41:13] behind because you know what people are
[1:41:14] going to walk up to the white throne
[1:41:16] and you know what somebody
[1:41:20] in that throng
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:24] god's gonna go did that person back
[1:41:26] there not tell you about me
[1:41:29] 50 years ago 100 years ago whenever you
[1:41:31] were
[1:41:32] and they're gonna have to say yes so
[1:41:34] what does the judging
[1:41:37] not so much here stands the judge but
[1:41:39] back there stands a judge
[1:41:41] but you got to remember it can reverse
[1:41:47] because here comes a man
[1:41:50] here comes a man that's just a cursed
[1:41:53] all the days of his life had three or
[1:41:54] four wives and
