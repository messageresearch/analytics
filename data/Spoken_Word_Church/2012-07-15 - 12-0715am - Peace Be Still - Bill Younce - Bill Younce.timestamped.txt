[1:40] that was was done because we had a good
[1:43] time we we filled up good so that's the
[1:46] the main thing we had a good time in the

[1:49] a good job expressing you know their
[1:52] thoughts about this part of you know
[1:56] what happened in 1963 of the pillar of
[1:59] cloud and why the dates are different
[2:01] and things and all and I thought they
[2:03] done a good job of expressing it it was
[2:05] it was really good because we know like
[2:08] I told them we knew back in the even in
[2:10] the right around about 70 somewhere
[2:12] right in there that there was a
[2:13] discrepancy about the dates that they
[2:16] were arguing about then but now there's
[2:19] a lot coming out and saying things and
[2:22] and all like that that about it but it's
[2:24] got to be here there must needs to be
[2:26] heresies among you that are they that

[10:47] R I thought you had wed up for 220
[10:57] there brother him should be preaching
[11:00] instead of me back and
[11:03] some get real nervous when I get around
[11:06] a lot of theologians and the
[11:10] message so I started to say this is a
[11:12] special year for me me sister Charley
[11:15] been married 48 years June the 12th
[11:22] amen got the same one I started out with
[11:25] amen I've raised her the best I know
[11:28] house since 16 years old you Fells get
[11:31] married that's the best time to get them
[11:33] and then that way you can train them
[11:34] like you want them while they're young
[11:36] and
[11:38] so then uh in October I'll start my 45th
[11:42] year preaching the message hour yes sir
[11:46] I'm going to preach the sample today
[11:47] that you probably won't even think that
[11:49] I preach the
[11:51] message all I can preach so deep that I
[11:54] can throw you out of life jacket to come
[11:56] and bring you back in right but we and I
[11:59] know you all here are so established in
[12:02] the word of God because I know you're
[12:03] Pastor real well am right you're
[12:06] established in the
[12:08] word but I think a lot of times as I
[12:11] travel throughout the country people
[12:13] needs more faith right exactly and so if
[12:17] you have your Bibles let's turn to St
[12:18] Matthew chapter number
[12:20] 27 I appreciate brother Dale having
[12:23] confidence in me Amen to ask me to stay
[12:27] over is this is just an easy weekend I
[12:30] preached in Illinois North Carolina
[12:32] Friday night I got in here at 15 till 2:
[12:35] Saturday morning we were here all day in
[12:37] the service I'm going to try to get out
[12:39] of here by so if you see me hit the door
[12:41] and take off the flying I've got to
[12:42] slide back in the pull Pit by 6:00 and
[12:45] Elizabeth and
[12:47] so while I'm young I I figured I better
[12:49] do all I can for the
[12:51] Lord Matthew
[12:57] 2750 Jesus
[13:00] when he had cried again with a loud
[13:02] voice yielded up The
[13:05] Ghost and behold the veil of the temple
[13:08] was rent in Twain From the top to the
[13:10] bottom mhm and the Earth did quake and
[13:14] the Rocks rent and the graves were
[13:18] opened and many bodies of the Saints
[13:21] which slept arose and came out of the
[13:23] graves after his
[13:25] resurrection went into the holy city and
[13:27] appeared unto many mhm now when the
[13:30] Centurion and they that were with him
[13:32] watching Jesus saw the earthquake and
[13:36] those things that were done they feared
[13:38] greatly saying truly this was the son of
[13:43] God let's
[13:45] pray Master
[13:48] Jesus we know that you're in the house
[13:51] today because we're here yes Lord God
[13:54] does not dwell in sheet rock and pews
[13:57] and lights and carpet
[13:59] he dwells in people and so when your
[14:02] people walked in the house today God is
[14:05] here Among Us Lord and so let us today
[14:08] be encouraged and strengthened that we
[14:11] are a part of God's kingdom yes Lord we
[14:15] should be so excited Lord about all the
[14:17] things that have been going on and the
[14:19] things that we have heard yes Lord they
[14:22] ought to be such a praise Among Us L
[14:24] that we'd have to holler and tell people
[14:27] to quien down like do when we're in
[14:29] India so much praise of God that my
[14:32] interpreter has to say please be quiet I
[14:35] can't hear Brother Bill that's right
[14:36] what's wrong with us Americans God yes
[14:39] Lord we saw the same book and the same
[14:41] lamb that John saw and it so caused such
[14:44] a praise in his life that he just he was
[14:47] a real Church disturber so God I pray
[14:50] that you'll come today and let the Holy
[14:52] Ghost saturate his house and we'll just
[14:54] love and appreciate you for your grace
[14:56] strengthen somebody's faith today we'll
[14:59] honor you for it in your precious name
[15:01] we pray amen may God bless you can be
[15:08] seated well nothing else it feels good
[15:11] to have my ears
[15:15] free and so uh from those scriptures
[15:18] I've read to you this morning I'd like
[15:20] to preach to you on the first visit
[15:23] behind the veil
[15:26] amen and so uh the scripture that we
[15:30] just read to
[15:32] you the whole entire world had been
[15:34] waiting on this for thousands of
[15:37] years for this event to take
[15:41] place it was the purpose of
[15:45] God and the hunger of
[15:48] man that always desired and wanted to
[15:51] see God
[15:53] sure and we'd like to approach it first
[15:56] if you don't mind uh in the best way
[15:59] that I can simply explain
[16:02] it is it's like the priesthood yeah
[16:06] that's been handed
[16:08] down and I can't help it because God
[16:11] chose it to be this way but God he chose
[16:16] to hand the priesthood down from father
[16:19] to son that's right that's right right
[16:21] and I want to talk about a son
[16:24] that he's been prepared
[16:29] the years of his life by his father yeah
[16:32] yeah and he's being taught by his
[16:35] dad the things that be of God to
[16:39] now when this happened back in the old
[16:42] days of Jesus day they they never had a
[16:44] new testament to study that's right
[16:46] that's right and so his dad had to teach
[16:49] him all the things of the old
[16:51] scriptures yes but
[16:54] uh just the same time because I try to
[16:57] get down by four if
[17:00] I to save time let's just go like to the
[17:05] night
[17:06] before this son for his first time in
[17:09] all of his
[17:11] life I guess all night long he's crying
[17:14] out
[17:16] tomorrow I get to see God for my first
[17:20] time yeah oh yeah come on could you
[17:23] imagine what a Saturday night this boy
[17:25] had
[17:27] right all these things that dad told me
[17:31] right I must be so careful tomorrow
[17:34] because I'm going behind the veil where
[17:37] God is at yes and I can remember he
[17:41] would roll and Tumble in so excitement
[17:44] and that's the way every one of us ought
[17:46] to be when we come into the house of God
[17:48] we ought to rode and tumbled on out long
[17:52] I I hope you all don't thinking I'm
[17:53] trying to tell you to do something
[17:55] different here but I require my church
[17:59] when I get out of that chair and I head
[18:02] to that pull pit I want everybody in my
[18:04] church standing on your feet Clapping
[18:06] Your Hands and praising God because
[18:09] we're going to hear something from Glory
[18:10] today amen and give God a praise because
[18:14] the Holy Ghost has been dealing with
[18:16] your pastor whoever all night and today
[18:19] we're going to hear from God that's
[18:21] right and so this boy is so excited
[18:24] about tomorrow getting to see God for
[18:26] his first time and I just imagine
[18:29] brother way as he makes his way into
[18:31] that church will just yall don't mind
[18:33] Templar Church whatever so you can
[18:36] simply know what I'm talking about and
[18:38] the boy walks in the back door and and
[18:41] he sees that Veil 40t High believe
[18:44] brother 40t high and it's covers the
[18:47] whole entire front of the temple and how
[18:50] would you like to come to church here
[18:52] all of these years and you never got to
[18:54] see God and your pastor is the only one
[18:55] that's allowed to see him right and uh I
[18:58] I know that and and what I have heard if
[19:01] you look behind that Veil and you're not
[19:05] qualified to do that you're a dead man
[19:08] that's right well I'd have been a dead
[19:10] man right because I'm nosy when it comes
[19:13] to the gospel I want to know everything
[19:15] that's going on I would have to just
[19:17] walk up and pull back and take a little
[19:19] peek behind her and see what he been
[19:21] talking about all these years cuz I want
[19:23] to know wouldn't you and so he starts
[19:26] down that Highway and that his daddy had
[19:29] taught him he's now it's going over in
[19:32] his mind right and he said first of all
[19:35] I remember my daddy told me if I go
[19:38] behind that Veil and I've got sin in my
[19:40] life they're going to drag me out there
[19:42] a dead man right right right so that's
[19:45] why a lot of churches around the message
[19:47] don't want the Holy Ghost no more
[19:49] because it's a house
[19:51] cleaner and they're afraid their sins
[19:53] are going to be discerned out and they
[19:55] don't want nobody to know about it but I
[19:57] want you to know that the word of God is
[19:59] here this morning to discern your heart
[20:01] out and you can't get away with nothing
[20:05] and people in my church accuse me all
[20:06] the time they say brother Bill you have
[20:09] got my house
[20:10] bugged
[20:12] oh because last not everything that we
[20:15] said in our home and talked about you
[20:17] brought it across the pull pit what that
[20:19] is that's the word Discerning you out
[20:22] right and he's trying to help you right
[20:24] but so this boy now he's worried and I I
[20:28] believe that everybody that claims to be
[20:30] a believer when you come in the house of
[20:32] God you ought to make sure that if
[20:35] there's been any sin committed you ought
[20:37] to be crying out have my father I need
[20:39] help this morning I want to be clean God
[20:41] when I come in here I don't want the
[20:43] Holy Ghost to have to beat up on me
[20:45] that's right you you ever even see your
[20:47] pastor and I tell my people a whole lot
[20:48] time ever since we open the door in
[20:51] heaven and let it we're lifted up and we
[20:53] coming up a little bit higher and all
[20:54] the time we have to come back down to
[20:56] the Butcher Block yeah oh yeah and start
[21:00] whittling on everybody and cutting them
[21:01] up why is that cuz you pulled us down to
[21:04] the Earth that's right and we're trying
[21:06] to keep you up here and you and your
[21:08] life keeps pulling us down we just need
[21:10] a fresh dedication of God in all of our
[21:14] Lives I believe brother R said we
[21:16] backslide every day of our life every
[21:19] day we don't make progress in God we're
[21:21] backsliding true my where we ought to be
[21:23] now we ought to be in such a Heavenly
[21:26] atmosphere hey that's what what's
[21:28] happening to the bride today the voice
[21:30] has calling out to it come up a little
[21:32] higher amen amen but still yet I deal
[21:35] with people like your pting them 25
[21:37] years Pastor would you help me time my
[21:40] Sho you know what I'm talking about
[21:43] spiritually where you been 25 years
[21:46] what's been going on what have you been
[21:47] hearing right amen oh I better get back
[21:50] to my story
[21:51] okay so this boy wants to make sure he
[21:54] has no sin in his life right amen and so
[21:57] now he comes down the
[21:59] hway and he gets ready to make his step
[22:01] up on that platform real say m could you
[22:05] imagine the feeling in his heart that's
[22:08] right oh I hope I'm not driving you
[22:09] crazy brother go ahead you got to be a
[22:11] fast cameraman to keep up
[22:14] yeah but
[22:17] uh that fear of going where God's at yep
[22:21] yes making sure that everything is
[22:23] perfectly all right right amen and it's
[22:26] such a fear when you make that first
[22:27] step
[22:29] on that platform to reach and pull that
[22:30] Veil back for your first
[22:33] time cuz you're going to see something
[22:36] you've never saw in all amen you're
[22:39] going to feel something that you've
[22:40] never felt since the day you was born
[22:43] and in all of a sudden he pulls the veil
[22:45] back right and he walks in and he starts
[22:49] looking around and he looks at the they
[22:51] altar the shoe bread and all that and
[22:53] I'll not go through all these things to
[22:54] save time but you all know all about and
[22:56] so he he he says what you know that's
[22:59] just what daddy told me everything's
[23:01] just exactly R away just like Daddy told
[23:03] me it was and he keeps walking and he
[23:05] knows he knows he's got some more Realms
[23:07] he's got to go through with and there's
[23:10] some more steps he's got to take in
[23:11] order to get back where he really wants
[23:13] to be for that day and so he starts
[23:16] making his little March back through the
[23:19] different veils and the different Realms
[23:21] of God and all of a sudden he comes into
[23:24] a
[23:25] presence a presence that some time you
[23:28] get into it it might make you talk in
[23:31] Tong I'm not ashamed of that it might
[23:34] make you do a holy dance it might make
[23:37] you scream and cry and holler you don't
[23:39] never know what you're going to do when
[23:40] you get in God's presence today over
[23:43] with God's presence might be here so
[23:45] strong you might be rolling down that
[23:47] highway
[23:48] back oh yeah all right now I'm getting
[23:51] ready fight got
[23:53] take
[23:55] bless and so as he goes back and all of
[23:59] a sudden he gets into a place or
[24:02] position MH that he realizes now I I am

[38:32] ever come not only to be held in your
[38:34] arms Jesus it's greater now than it was
[38:37] 2,000 years ago Jesus said I'll not only

[38:42] you Jesus be with you in a minute by the
[38:44] way he turn say I have need to go by
[38:46] Samaria and bless God he's gone and you

[39:03] testify that the Holy Ghost is in my
[39:05] soul wherever I go to church or to visit
[39:08] the grandchildren or wherever I go but
[39:10] Jesus is going with me because he said
[39:12] he'd be in me even to the end of the
[39:14] world and if you think be satisfied and
[39:16] can't overcome the world with Jesus in
[39:19] you what's he going to
[39:20] take yes yes exactly that
[39:25] brother all
[39:27] you nothing bothers me you're a
[39:30] liar things do bother us I'm a preacher
[39:34] and I'm a human being and things bother
[39:36] me the greatest thing bothers me church
[39:41] people church people are
[39:44] you you know you study all week long and
[39:47] you try to get a message together and
[39:49] you you you know a pastor can't help so
[39:52] we
[39:55] know now the Bible says that the saint
[39:57] shall judge the Earth who could judge
[39:59] this church any more than brother Del
[40:00] because he every one of you and so we we
[40:03] have these thoughts and we can't help
[40:05] but maybe this will really help that
[40:06] person this morning maybe this little
[40:08] word that's coming will really help this
[40:09] and encourage them and give them
[40:10] strength and you come in and they ain't
[40:12] here exactly right I think the word IR
[40:16] ain't see it irks
[40:19] me find when you're expecting them all
[40:22] right all righty
[40:24] so I believe the Lord to bless us
[40:28] today then in our day did you know that
[40:31] Satan's even trying to make us all doubt
[40:34] who we can make it or not absolutely
[40:37] truth brother tell you you can't make it
[40:39] oh yeah you just goingn have to talk to
[40:41] it
[40:44] amen Satan talks to us preachers too
[40:47] sure oh yeah he tells me you think
[40:50] you're something you ain't
[40:52] nothing you nothing but a dog I said
[40:54] you're a devil
[40:57] you don't know who I am I'm King
[41:00] bill you call me a dog but God said I'll
[41:03] be a
[41:04] king right I will make you Kings and
[41:08] Priests who you you know why you have to
[41:10] be a king because somebody is going to
[41:13] Crown Him king of kings and that's us
[41:17] amen amen I'm going to around I'm going
[41:21] to wear a crown yes it's a bright and
[41:23] Shining Crown God said I was yeah God
[41:27] said I a King sir does anybody treat you
[41:30] like he was a king anywhere you
[41:32] go brother I treat me like a king since
[41:35] I've been here I don't have to have my
[41:36] crown on to be treated like that's right
[41:38] that's right so the devil's trying to
[41:40] tell us all we can't make it that's
[41:41] right it's like it was I believe it's
[41:44] about the last uh Exodus chapter 5 and
[41:48] you ever hear Moses fussed
[41:51] God Moses fussing at God he said you
[41:53] brought us out here now and we we've
[41:55] done all these things and you got us out
[41:57] here now and and you ain't done nothing
[41:59] for
[42:00] us God just told him two little words
[42:02] and I preached on many time you'll
[42:07] see brother Bill How can any of us in
[42:09] here making me into glory and make the
[42:11] body change you'll see when the
[42:13] transforming power of God comes down he
[42:15] can roll back the Red Sea it can change
[42:17] bodies it can do anything it wants to
[42:19] that's when it's here yes sir so you'll
[42:21] see just hang around a little while and
[42:24] you're going to see there's somebody in
[42:25] the air
[42:26] want to make
[42:28] a yes sir we're going out of
[42:32] here so let's see if uh somebody can
[42:36] make it let's go to St Mark 4 is this
[42:40] simple enough for you
[42:41] all it's just simply deep good
[42:49] simp St Mark
[42:51] 4 now when I read this if you don't
[42:54] catch these little old words in here you
[42:56] might miss my thought am I doing okay
[42:59] you're doing good you're
[43:01] fine St Mark
[43:09] 435 verse 35 says in the same
[43:13] day when the evened was come he sath
[43:17] unto them let us pass over unto the
[43:21] other side right and when they had sent
[43:23] away the
[43:24] multitude they took him even as he was
[43:27] in the
[43:28] ship and there were also with him other
[43:31] little ships and there arose a great
[43:33] storm of wind and the waves beat into
[43:37] the ship so that it was now
[43:41] full how much more water could you get
[43:43] in the ship when it's
[43:45] full you can't get another drop in it
[43:47] it's full the next drop it's overrun
[43:51] right yes and there Rose a great storm
[43:54] oh I just read that and he was in the H
[43:56] part of the ship asleep on a pillow yeah
[44:00] and they awake him and say unto him
[44:02] Master carest thou not that we perish
[44:07] right and he arose and rebuked the
[44:10] wind and said un the sea P me still and
[44:14] the wind ceased and there was a great
[44:16] calm amen and he said unto them why are
[44:18] you so fearful how is it that you have
[44:21] no faith and they feared exceedingly and
[44:24] said one to another what manner of man
[44:26] is this that even the wind and the Sea
[44:29] away
[44:32] yes I suppose words that was said about
[44:40] Jesus how can I say this without trying
[44:42] to make me something the words he said
[44:46] people said about
[44:48] him never a man ever spoke like his man
[44:51] that's
[44:53] right that's my heart's desire yeah
[44:56] right yes I have people sometimes
[44:59] Brother D I know You' have they've been
[45:00] people that you preach brother Tim
[45:02] around somewhere they say brother Bill
[45:04] you said something 10 years ago and I'll
[45:05] never forget it I like that
[45:10] person but we ought to be people that's
[45:12] preaching things that nobody has ever
[45:14] spoke like that's right that's right and
[45:17] that's why it has such an effect on
[45:19] people if this message is introduced
[45:21] right right yes and so we got to do for
[45:24] people here and Jesus is telling us now
[45:27] that maybe if the devil has got you
[45:28] worried about get making it over there
[45:30] yeah what did he say he said let us pass
[45:34] over unto the other side yes did he say
[45:38] this storm was going to stop us no did
[45:41] he say that maybe a bous win or
[45:43] something other is going to come up and
[45:44] stop us n no and so the devil if he's a
[45:48] beating on you tell
[45:50] him we will make it amen cuz God said
[45:57] amen and so if he told us to go to the
[45:59] other side ain't nothing and the Gates
[46:02] of Hell shall not Prevail against us
[46:05] there's not nothing going to stop us
[46:06] from getting over there how many of you

[46:13] stop us amen Obama's not going to stop

[1:04:23] sorry
[1:04:25] I hope I don't get in trouble and I get
[1:04:27] to come back to
[1:04:30] again and straight
[1:04:33] way verse 22 of St Matthew 14 and
[1:04:38] straight way Jesus constrained his
[1:04:40] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[1:04:44] before him unto the other side while he
[1:04:46] sent the multitude away that's kind of
[1:04:48] like a lot of preachers ain't trying to
[1:04:49] get them to open the door and let Christ
[1:04:51] come into the church
[1:04:53] right and when he had sent the
[1:04:55] multitudes away he went up into a
[1:04:58] mountain apart to pray and when the
[1:05:00] evening was come he was there but the
[1:05:03] ship was now in the midst of the sea
[1:05:05] tossed with waves another storm coming
[1:05:07] up yeah for the wind was
[1:05:09] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:05:12] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[1:05:14] the sea amen and when the disciples saw
[1:05:18] him walking on the sea they were
[1:05:20] troubled saying yes it is a spirit and
[1:05:24] they cried out for
[1:05:26] fear but straight way Jesus spake unto
[1:05:29] them saying be a good cheer it's I Be
[1:05:32] not Afraid kind of like Jack C talking
[1:05:35] getting elev woman said I've got cancer
[1:05:37] he said be a good cheer
[1:05:39] sister whatever whatever they had Jack
[1:05:41] they be of good cheer everything's all
[1:05:43] right God knows how to heal
[1:05:45] people right Be not Afraid yeah is
[1:05:49] anybody here actually afraid
[1:05:52] today you afraid you going to get right
[1:05:54] over by a train coming out of here yeah
[1:05:56] no just watch the lights and that thing
[1:05:58] come down front of you stop yeah that's
[1:06:02] right and Peter answered him and said
[1:06:05] Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[1:06:09] on the
[1:06:11] water and Jesus looked back at him said
[1:06:13] one word
[1:06:15] come and when Peter was come down out of
[1:06:17] the ship he walked on the water go to
[1:06:21] Jesus sure but when he saw the wind bers
[1:06:23] he was afraid beginning to sink he cried
[1:06:26] saying Lord save me and immediately like
[1:06:28] a Rapture Jesus stretched forth his hand
[1:06:30] and CI and said unto him oh thou little
[1:06:33] faith wherefor did thou
[1:06:35] doubt all right can I tell this story
[1:06:37] like this amen Peter was a
[1:06:40] Fishman I never read where he knowed how
[1:06:42] to swim or
[1:06:44] not never have heard I don't know if he
[1:06:47] if he even knowed how to swim or not
[1:06:49] right don't know if keep swim like an
[1:06:50] Indian you know how to do their hands
[1:06:51] over their head and like it but now
[1:06:54] somebody asked him to
[1:06:56] come and let's just look at it like this
[1:06:58] here's this big boat and it's got like a
[1:07:00] rope ladder down the
[1:07:02] side and
[1:07:04] Peter at his
[1:07:07] command and in his mind he's qu he's
[1:07:10] calming down this letter he said he's
[1:07:12] asking me to do what it takes of God to
[1:07:14] do M uhhuh sure so he starts coming down
[1:07:19] the L brother could you imagine the
[1:07:21] thoughts in his mind but coming down to
[1:07:24] water yeah and especially when he to his
[1:07:26] toes touch the cold water you know that
[1:07:28] we do sometime but he's said he said I
[1:07:32] I'm moving at his command he only said
[1:07:34] one word in me y right yesly and if he
[1:07:38] says come you better come that's right
[1:07:41] no matter what the situation is amen but
[1:07:43] all of a sudden his feet touch the water
[1:07:46] and he's doing now what it takes a God
[1:07:48] today that's right Jesus Christ I hope
[1:07:51] we see where we're in am I'm doing what
[1:07:55] it take God to do now I'm walking on the
[1:07:57] water like he
[1:07:59] is I will walk on the water with you yes
[1:08:03] I will walk on the water with you I
[1:08:07] guess he just started singing here he
[1:08:08] went towards
[1:08:10] Jes and he's like a lot of us there's a
[1:08:12] borous wind wave ra up and it's a bigger
[1:08:15] waves and things that had been seen that
[1:08:18] day yep and he let that boisterous wind
[1:08:20] get his attention off that's right what
[1:08:22] he's looking at y
[1:08:24] what he was doing and there's a lot of
[1:08:27] Winds of doctrines and things come
[1:08:28] around us and get our eyes off what our
[1:08:30] real goal
[1:08:31] is right
[1:08:34] brother and so he's walking down and
[1:08:37] he's looking at this bous
[1:08:39] wind and it causes him to lose his foing
[1:08:45] right and he started sinking y oh yeah
[1:08:49] and you know what Jesus said Jesus
[1:08:50] didn't cuss him
[1:08:51] out Jesus didn't fuss at him yeah he
[1:08:54] never said one word he just said oh you
[1:08:57] have little faith yes see that's where
[1:09:00] we got our P pastors we got to start
[1:09:02] talking to our people right oh you have
[1:09:05] real faith can you just see the faith of
[1:09:08] Jesus Christ is being revealed through
[1:09:10] the message of the hour correct oh yeah
[1:09:12] can't you see the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:13] Christ and what a faith it brings and
[1:09:16] and you know uh we are right now
[1:09:18] supposed to be doing things that only a
[1:09:21] God can do that's right that's right
[1:09:24] exactly right you know why we do things
[1:09:27] that God does because he lives in
[1:09:31] here and when he starts speaking out of
[1:09:33] his mouth right we don't necessarily
[1:09:36] every time have to say it's thus sayith
[1:09:38] the Lord we just say lady
[1:09:41] be
[1:09:43] amen I don't even lay my hands on people
[1:09:47] no more and pray for
[1:09:49] them I don't use oil and anoint people
[1:09:52] no more when I I pray I found a higher
[1:09:55] Faith than that
[1:09:57] blessed I got some looks looking at me
[1:10:02] now go ahead brother there was one man
[1:10:05] that wanted Jesus to come by the house
[1:10:06] and pray for his daughter yep MH and he
[1:10:09] wanted him to lay his hands on her and
[1:10:12] brother brand said that bottle of oil
[1:10:14] that I use he said it's been the biggest
[1:10:16] hindrance of my ministry that's ever
[1:10:17] been in the United States of America but
[1:10:20] it's a Jewish tradition and we're
[1:10:22] supposed to be getting ready from all
[1:10:23] these traditions and all that's right a
[1:10:26] Jewish tradition but there was another
[1:10:28] man a ceron that had a 100 people or
[1:10:30] more over him he said I'm my servant I
[1:10:31] tell him to do this and he does that and
[1:10:33] he does these things and you know he
[1:10:35] said Jesus you do not I'm not even
[1:10:38] worthy that youd come by my house y but
[1:10:41] he said all you have to do is just speak
[1:10:42] the word will be healed yes amen that's
[1:10:46] the faith of Jesus Christ you know what
[1:10:48] Jesus my
[1:10:50] Lord I have not found so great a Faith
[1:10:54] No not in all of Israel that's this man
[1:10:56] right here is God right then if he could
[1:10:59] have that greater Faith why can't we it
[1:11:02] and go ahead like this little woman and
[1:11:04] speak the word
[1:11:08] amen that's right right Nick this is
[1:11:11] great you said we got some great things

[1:11:18] right now to anybody in this building
[1:11:20] that would say you're possessed to the
