[2:18] able to gather together this morning to
[2:20] be able to speak about you and your Lord
[2:24] to let you direct each thought in mind
[2:27] as we would Lord desire to hear from you
[2:30] speak to our hearts this morning because
[2:33] that's our desire more than anything in
[2:35] the world that we may Lord see you
[2:38] living among us forgive our sins mess

[2:53] as we read you your word you give us

[3:00] tonight as you'll be ministering the
[3:02] Lord just bless and guide each one and
[3:04] he puts all in Jesus name Amen thanks 13
[3:10] the anodd scripture be an on-message
[3:13] this one may yes so take a vacation and
[3:18] then from ministering for a while and
[3:21] then come back and then we can get
[3:24] started back in the Lord yo so we're
[3:27] going to acts 13 verse 14 and when they
[3:34] departed from burger and they came to
[3:37] any hot impress idea we see Abraham
[3:40] pronouncing went into the synagogue on
[3:42] the Sabbath day and sat down and I after
[3:45] the reading of the law of the prophets
[3:47] the rulers of the single synagogue
[3:50] sealing to them saying you men and
[3:52] brethren if you have any word of
[3:54] exhortation for the people say own then
[3:59] Paul stood up and beckoning with his
[4:01] hands
[4:02] men of Israel you that fear God give
[4:07] audience you may be seated the more that
[4:09] is messing to the reading of the word
[4:13] they said it did make the announcement
[4:17] that the brother over live in
[4:20] Afghanistan that they they killed him is
[4:23] that way to say it well according to
[4:25] brother Richard Wilson he called him and
[4:27] you know we don't know which ones water
[4:30] what but that was a believer in the
[4:32] message that was over there so that's
[4:35] what we we've the last part that we
[4:37] found he said to take holding that from
[4:39] from Jeff that net was a believer dark
[4:42] so just Aaron said remember the family
[4:45] and just prayed the Lord would bless you
[4:47] know you know you know yes we're we
[4:51] don't live in those kind of countries we
[4:54] live in a freedom country and we better
[4:55] be sure it's our freedom to be able to
[4:59] speak our mind and our thoughts and all
[5:01] and until this time at least you know
[5:04] she'll just just pray for the family
[5:07] they meant now I said it would be a very
[5:11] odd message this morning because I want
[5:13] you to pay close attention and I want
[5:15] everybody here to not only those that
[5:18] are on the internet of a family today
[5:21] listening that are not able to come but
[5:24] I want to make sure that everybody hears
[5:25] this message today because it'll be a
[5:28] message from my hardest little back I
[5:30] guess two or three months that I've been
[5:33] thinking on this though they came to me
[5:36] you know that's just a thought so I want
[5:39] to express it to you
[5:40] you know Paul here in the scripture that
[5:43] says that you know they came to this
[5:45] place and they they did and it says Paul
[5:49] beckoning with his hands in other words
[5:51] he gave a sign he gave a sign out to the
[5:55] people you know I want to speak many are
[5:59] he may be his sign was to hold your
[6:02] peace while I speak or whatever it was
[6:04] but it said that he was beckoning
[6:07] hand and you know then he began to sleep
[6:13] and de Klerk his message under the
[6:15] people well now this is the statement
[6:18] that I want to make to you today because
[6:20] it's an art statement called a float and
[6:22] talk about statement Oh what statements
[6:27] I'm asking a question
[6:29] what statements are my actions chewy
[6:35] right
[6:36] what statements then we live in a day in
[6:39] a time when you know the kids going down
[6:42] the streets they have the pants fall
[6:45] down they you know right they're walking
[6:49] along with long higher our girls with
[6:52] short higher they got purple higher they
[6:55] got blue higher they got green higher
[6:57] they've got all kind of doings and
[7:00] wearing all kinds of clothes and if you
[7:03] say something to them about it what do
[7:05] they say they say I'm making a statement
[7:10] all right and I you know I went to
[7:13] Webster to see what it is um you know
[7:17] like a statement is soccer will you get
[7:19] you get a statement you know you get the
[7:21] things like that it's something stated
[7:24] it's a detailed or explicit
[7:28] communication it's the act or manner of
[7:34] stating something so to say the kids are
[7:38] saying this is my statement well right
[7:41] now let's don't go off on them I never
[7:43] have you know that we had our laptop
[7:49] haircuts
[7:50] we had our duck tails we had our long
[7:54] higher was in some forms but you know
[7:57] beginning to come down and and and we
[8:00] were making our statements with a bell
[8:02] bottom pants in the thing
[8:04] we were doing that in the kids today
[8:07] basically as they're saying I'm
[8:10] rebelling against society right that's a
[8:14] statement then your world is making you
[8:17] know you go to to any country that you
[8:20] go to and you'll see that their their
[8:23] manner of clothes their doings or
[8:26] actions is making a statement about you
[8:31] know what they're wanting to say right
[8:34] in the in a statement people can
[8:37] communicate see with sign language in
[8:39] other words raise hands what does it
[8:41] mean Universal sign of surrender see so
[8:45] you're making a statement and you're
[8:48] saying this is what I'm trying to say
[8:50] the way you walk the way you act the way
[8:54] you do is make you a statement that's
[8:57] worth it you know what you say
[8:59] somebody's done to hire one way and then
[9:03] you see them change to another way you
[9:05] know well most of the time they're
[9:07] making a statement all right
[9:10] I used to kind of push my backhand and
[9:14] everything until it got to get them
[9:15] sitting in front like that how much
[9:17] stand enough to push back and and I
[9:20] looked at it one day and then I thought
[9:22] this is me so I'm just honest I'm saying
[9:25] cause we all do it now so you know
[9:27] that's a Pentecostal look cause you
[9:32] never see a televangelist or any of
[9:34] these guys with a common haircut right
[9:36] it's it's a swept back as long you don't
[9:41] do it you know what I decided what I'm
[9:44] going to say
[9:44] then cut off I'm going to change my
[9:47] statement it's not that I don't want to
[9:50] be associated with anybody it's just I
[9:53] look back in my old days and I thought
[9:55] you know the haircut I wore when I was a
[9:58] kid was a good statement it was the only
[10:02] thing we've gonna forward right so I'm
[10:05] started saying well I'm going to cut off
[10:07] my took my heart back to make it like it
[10:09] is now and I'm going back to a country
[10:11] boy you know just a statement because
[10:14] now you think about it everything we do
[10:18] our manner of life are doing is making
[10:22] mistakes you were certain close you
[10:26] sisters you wear long dresses what do
[10:29] you make of a statement right you're
[10:33] saying I believe in being not modern any
[10:39] but it says modest a pearl see and so
[10:43] your statement is that you don't cut
[10:45] your heart then you're making a
[10:48] statement
[10:49] oh man you mean you don't go around with
[10:53] a long higher you know and all of the
[10:55] stuff like that one because we're making
[10:58] a statement to people that we are not
[11:02] like that we are different we're
[11:07] ourselves they were making the same
[11:10] everything you do is make a mistake who
[11:13] you follow me now all right so then in
[11:16] what we're doing what is our statements
[11:19] today declare
[11:25] statements are or can be verbal or they
[11:30] can be just you know as I said making a
[11:33] statement about clothes you buy the
[11:35] things you do but what kind of
[11:39] statements are we making all right now
[11:48] the prophet of God said go ahead and
[11:52] pull it number one with Brooke Anderson
[11:58] look like the prophet of God see no
[12:01] statements or actions or doings
[12:03] everybody follow me every man under
[12:07] there that had it and something
[12:09] different the world knew it
[12:11] every woman had it had something
[12:12] different the world knew it the world
[12:15] can see it
[12:15] your actions prove what you are you can
[12:20] say you got it but your actions speak so
[12:23] loud that they can't hear your voice
[12:26] your life speaks what you are all right
[12:32] now
[12:34] so then sisters if you're wearing your
[12:39] long dresses and you're making a
[12:43] statement with it that's wonderful
[12:46] but what kind of a statement would you
[12:48] be making if you put on the skimpy
[12:53] dresser you know
[12:57] done a little bit different when you go
[13:01] out now that was what I got into trouble
[13:05] here while back trying to explain about
[13:07] women you know I always do I'll get into
[13:09] trouble with this today but I'll get it
[13:13] off my heart to think we make a
[13:18] statement what kind of a statement are
[13:22] you making when you come to church
[13:25] looking decent but then you're ashamed
[13:29] to run into the pastor or somebody when
[13:34] you're out shopping now what kind of a
[13:37] statement anybody what do you say
[13:46] what's the point what are you saying
[13:50] let's see then we wonder why our
[13:52] children don't want the message when
[13:57] they can read our statements a whole lot
[14:00] better than we think
[14:01] you know what kind of statement is being
[14:06] made the brothers we you know we're
[14:11] Church we we talk good we are good and
[14:13] we do but then out on the world out
[14:16] there and people whether they're you
[14:20] know where we work around what kind of
[14:24] statement is our life a minute
[14:26] would it be a statement worthy of the
[14:28] gospel would it be you know something to
[14:36] win people to the message or would it be
[14:43] that they can look at our actions and
[14:46] they can't hear a testimony who hit with
[14:48] number two then their testimonies are
[14:51] killed by her actions what about it I'm
[14:55] just asking the question because it's
[15:01] time to give a nod and settle down and
[15:02] answer a lot of questions and to find
[15:07] that where we stand and what's going on
[15:08] - look what your prophets they we're are
[15:11] known by the life that we live it's been
[15:14] said you're alive sleep so loud I can't
[15:16] hear you testimony
[15:18] so therefore deliver a sermon with much
[15:23] better than to preach one the life you
[15:27] may have shows what character you are
[15:29] because your life always builds your
[15:32] character
[15:35] jesus said no one see my the fruits use
[15:38] your roving don't no matter what we
[15:40] would say or how much we would testify
[15:44] different lies doesn't coincide coincide
[15:47] with that testimony we are doing the
[15:51] kingdom of God an indefinite by giving
[15:54] that testimony because people know what
[15:58] we are so you say today brother you'll
[16:02] say today and I'm sure it's already hit
[16:04] some of your minds you say brother Dale
[16:07] is going to pick on me today
[16:08] you're exactly right okay
[16:12] okay brother dick brother mark brothers
[16:14] here let me nightmare my back through
[16:16] our local congregation I'm gonna pick on
[16:19] you today this is my day for coming back
[16:21] off a vacation the longest I ever went
[16:27] without preaching services since I've
[16:31] been preaching right so you know but now
[16:36] this
[16:39] our lives are so grateful people can't
[16:43] hear a testimony what is the testimony
[16:46] of your neighbor had none you see we're
[16:48] only deal with oh they think we're crazy
[16:50] bunch of nuts we believe a profit we did
[16:54] but what do they see you know they see
[17:00] us more than we think and you know
[17:02] they're looking a whole lot more than
[17:04] they're looking to find something to
[17:07] have an excuse for not accepting what
[17:11] you're saying right so they're watching
[17:16] what we do
[17:18] no no I can profit sit there then our
[17:21] lives is what bills are Ted per
[17:23] character he did say our testimony
[17:25] you know of our two means and all he
[17:28] said our lives that we live builds our
[17:31] character to a position so what does he
[17:36] language talk about you well I'll give
[17:40] it what they think well okay you're the
[17:43] one I'm talking about
[17:45] that's got to be the devil about God
[17:48] talking so that's who I'm talking about
[17:50] all right because the Prophet said we'd
[17:54] do in Determan you know we damage our
[17:58] testimonies about the kingdom the Lord
[18:02] saved me will say oh oh that's so
[18:05] wonderful
[18:05] I just see they make so wonderful in my
[18:08] heart and the neighbor sees you sisters
[18:10] with it just a little bit of makeup you
[18:14] know just a little doing this and a
[18:18] little doing that you cease your actions
[18:23] and reactions around people
[18:27] No seize the clothes you were the shoes
[18:31] you were you know what statement are we
[18:34] making we feel awful in the kids we go
[18:37] off on all of that you know and we see
[18:40] somebody or a group of people you know
[18:42] there's a group damage around Commerce
[18:46] there that are basically black people I
[18:49] don't know call the number after
[18:50] probably like Muslim I'm not certain I
[18:53] don't know it's nothing to me but you
[18:55] see them with their hiring or doings or
[18:58] caps on their long gowns and things like
[19:01] that well you know I wonder are we that
[19:06] we Americans we want to free these
[19:08] countries and you know yourself that the
[19:12] way I talk about it is we wanted to go
[19:14] to Afghanistan or somewhere and free
[19:16] those women well did we free them they
[19:24] would have had like Americans
[19:27] you know marrying wear long dresses even
[19:30] veiled over their face that I wouldn't
[19:33] say you had to wear that but what's the
[19:39] opposite side of it yeah
[19:44] because I've always been this way even
[19:46] if the women did Bank your face you have
[19:48] a veil over nobody could see done right
[19:53] but I've always been one thing I'm just
[19:59] honest now truthfully trying to me if
[20:03] I've ever going to want to dress rather
[20:05] won't dress right in church and do right
[20:10] at Churchill right well if your sisters
[20:17] if you can't if you've got to do this or
[20:20] you got to do that you got to punch your
[20:21] face a little you got to do these things
[20:23] at least you can do it while you're out
[20:25] in the world let them see you're just
[20:26] lost if I always tell the people around
[20:33] here don't go to some of these meetings
[20:36] and things and tell them where you go to
[20:38] church at cause I said you know this
[20:44] brother they don't let that go on
[20:46] can he see that those women make your
[20:49] face and and cut their hair a little bit
[20:51] it's tradition to this no no no no we
[20:53] just got the daddy and we just well what
[20:59] about it what kind of a statement are we
[21:03] trying to make what's our lives stating
[21:07] to the world that we believe oh yes
[21:11] we're quick to say we believe the
[21:12] Prophet if you heard the problem what
[21:16] what is the thing that you going here
[21:18] and there and things that see if it used
[21:20] to be another daddy but it is now the
[21:22] first thing you do you just type in and
[21:24] you type in we can Brandon well what do
[21:26] you get I mean do you get that so many
[21:32] people who are raising the dead you can
[21:36] get it that deep healing campaign that
[21:38] went to the world and so many millions
[21:40] were healed in' in an Africa alone that
[21:43] there was like 30,000 coins
[21:46] Hertz and one service or something like
[21:49] that is that what you get what do you
[21:52] get you get all the bad puns right why
[21:58] because they're making a statement right
[22:02] the people who put that on there are
[22:04] making a statement no this is like that
[22:09] gods general it's the first one that we
[22:11] were able to get a hold of it even
[22:12] mention run around without of that whole
[22:15] book that was dark of all of the great
[22:19] you know evangelists and and all like
[22:22] that run around was the only one that
[22:25] they attacked about his dogs they get
[22:30] the book read legal and let you have it
[22:35] he was the only one see George Soros get
[22:39] out in order to if I was reading the
[22:42] book you know what I'd say then one
[22:45] thing to read what this guy said is
[22:47] because everybody's against you but
[22:49] that's not the way people do right what
[22:52] kind of statement are they making I'll
[22:55] kind of a statement are we making what
[23:00] are our last display maybe that's the
[23:05] reason our children some of them don't
[23:06] want to mess it maybe that's the reason
[23:10] they don't believe it well because they
[23:12] don't see you they see you and I but
[23:15] they see us in the faith because they
[23:21] see us that a time that maybe you know
[23:24] we get upset we get this we get that
[23:25] when I said one that's no different
[23:27] nobody else
[23:34] see what is our statement you believe
[23:38] that around his property my brother just
[23:45] not too long ago back he made a
[23:48] statement one time and he said that's no
[23:51] different any other Church Willie's holy
[23:59] prophets makes it then
[24:01] that's just another denomination right
[24:05] you know liking words I'm sure but all
[24:08] right
[24:11] but you see one day I had an opportunity
[24:13] to just express my this message look
[24:17] this this message was not an argument
[24:20] the fuss and rocking up complaining and
[24:22] clothes wearing and miss that nilly but
[24:25] it was a revelation of Jesus Christ
[24:29] simply to show us Christ then to see
[24:34] Christ Minnie and the people we you know
[24:39] that one the person who did the macy's a
[24:43] lot more than the arguments I couldn't
[24:45] put forward the quoting of the
[24:48] scriptures
[24:48] Oh wonderful but what are people
[24:54] watching how do we leave them how do we
[25:06] that's gonna be blood people have
[25:10] athletes that pray for me pray for my
[25:12] family you'll come to church we pray
[25:17] they come to church and what happens to
[25:21] the people that was praying come on they
[25:28] start leasing I like it a little your NY
[25:32] life see we'll cover that too maybe this
[25:37] afternoon baptism but you know that what
[25:42] we confess and what is going to be the
[25:48] Bible doesn't say Q to confess your sin
[25:51] it says to confess you're here with
[25:54] metaphor say but we're not supposed to
[25:59] confess receipt you want to say confess
[26:03] it's not wrong to say I don't feel good
[26:06] I'm sick that's right because we are
[26:09] human being but when we just lay on that
[26:15] and build on that
[26:18] and every time we don't feel good but I
[26:23] wonder
[26:26] if you were called men women whatever
[26:29] who do you say one thing you see
[26:31] everybody knows things you're talking
[26:32] about the isn't undone
[26:33] I'm just know about all of us so forget
[26:35] it but sisters are you know brothers if
[26:40] you were called on this evening to
[26:42] direct the services I said direct that
[26:44] way you would be preaching and you got
[26:50] violently sick before you came what
[26:52] would you do
[26:59] then you'd get better without service
[27:02] money could you call it your duty or
[27:09] what if somebody invited you to come to

[29:57] of our good beautiful actions we talk
[29:59] about they're watching our reactions
[30:02] behind us and we claim to believe
[30:09] everything about things not just exactly
[30:14] you tell them it's written in the Bible
[30:16] though they might not say those words
[30:21] but that's what they express did you
[30:27] ever hear you don't say an action speaks
[30:28] louder than words well then does it
[30:31] actions speak louder than words no
[30:35] matter what you're saying you your life
[30:39] speaks aloud till they can't hear your
[30:41] testimony as I said this morning just
[30:44] jump as high as you live yeah your
[30:48] action speaks louder than your words and
[30:51] you just might as well come out and say
[30:54] it because their own words speed you
[31:00] your words no matter what it is your
[31:02] actions speak
[31:04] what's your honor
[31:08] yes if you speak anything different from
[31:11] what you really are what is he saying
[31:18] it becomes hypocrisy Jesus said you
[31:22] never Chris how do you say good things
[31:24] when out of the heart speak and out of
[31:27] the heart speak with the mouth see they
[31:30] were saying something they didn't mean
[31:32] and women so it is to say oh my have my
[31:35] own fun
[31:38] what about it bro they'll have you to
[31:44] understand I live the Bible to the
[31:49] letter well let's get off the letter
[31:55] give the love in their hearts leading it
[32:01] to the letter is one thing those
[32:04] Pharisees live it to the letter
[32:06] right but what did Jesus call Democratic
[32:13] never natively he could look down into
[32:16] him because nobody else to call them
[32:18] hypocrites right let me come up there
[32:21] nobody else in walk up call Mill Creek
[32:26] that's lie to me when Jesus said to that
[32:29] you mean you know that time when the
[32:31] woman was there before but said he
[32:34] didn't without sin cast the first stone
[32:38] see he brought out into the inside of
[32:40] them into the open the little things
[32:43] they had secretly hidden run
[32:51] in one bottle when they walked away you
[32:57] were not fooling nobody with our sight
[33:00] no alright see our children are watching
[33:06] every move we might and what have they
[33:12] seen
[33:17] luenell get you drunk no they'll tell on
[33:22] me
[33:23] right you just tell one of them kids you
[33:28] don't like what brother Dale said and
[33:30] they'll come around say you know I don't
[33:32] know why I'm with my mom or my dad you
[33:33] said didn't mind what you say
[33:37] remember the see Byron and 42 children
[33:41] they wouldn't say go up will ball head
[33:44] ain't even know anything about this kid
[33:46] ain't know anything about going up for
[33:47] anything they were hearing mom and daddy
[33:50] sitting around the table that little
[33:54] feller sitting on the floor
[33:57] you better be careful he's coming up the
[34:03] road the other day and we kept trying to
[34:07] figure out what how long it's been
[34:09] you remember the last Christmas program
[34:11] we had was that Ben it wasn't this year
[34:15] that would be year before so it had to
[34:16] be on back right
[34:20] happy shaking her head she knows I'm on
[34:23] top of my her she couldn't have been
[34:26] over two years old right she would have
[34:32] been from the Christmas up to that maybe
[34:35] two and a half you know what she said
[34:39] did you remember when white had that
[34:41] fighting on you know that got over his
[34:43] face and and had that gal home and he
[34:46] was doing that in that play with me and
[34:49] put on its a jerk and said remember how
[34:53] I was dressed up like a horse and said
[34:58] no I hope I get said JK was dressed up
[35:01] like a cow and Zoey was dressed up like
[35:04] a pig
[35:10] he said what are you getting that but
[35:12] two-and-a-half-year-old describe it what
[35:16] happened how can you remember what
[35:20] that's fine but you wish you remember
[35:27] that if she described in detail the
[35:34] looks and the things it was taking money
[35:36] do you think they're not watching you
[35:42] think they're not seeing the actions
[35:45] look the next paragraph 51 a prisoner of
[35:51] 63 still in play as I just expressed if
[35:58] your life will prove and once if your
[36:02] life will prove your life will prove
[36:05] exactly what size your own I don't care
[36:09] what size you say your own what you do
[36:13] every day prove what you are you've
[36:17] heard the old saying your life is so
[36:19] loud I can't hear you testimony see your
[36:23] accent it's the lab I've always believed
[36:27] in shouting and jumping but I always say
[36:29] don't jump little higher than you live
[36:32] because of the world is going to watch
[36:35] that the you must just jump as high as
[36:39] you Liam no because everybody is
[36:42] watching you
[36:46] everybody's watching
[36:53] their watch interactions or reactions
[36:56] are doing we say we love God we love
[37:02] these word but why is the people of this
[37:08] makes you get all upset when somebody
[37:10] can quote brother branham's messy
[37:14] is it that they don't read it study the
[37:20] microphone brother the other day I said
[37:22] you know big ones call me than anybody
[37:24] unless is my lord after studying this
[37:26] maxi's over 40 years we already know a
[37:28] little bit about what I'm gonna run say
[37:30] yeah right I mean if that's how you
[37:35] study then you studied everybody else
[37:37] that's theories but if you studied the
[37:42] message then what is it
[37:45] just remember we're not fooling somebody
[37:51] we get up here we play which saying we
[37:54] worship with challeng for a little bit
[37:57] no but we and what you were looking at
[38:06] you know that I've had a visiting
[38:08] preacher ask me what's wrong with some
[38:11] of you now do you like place
[38:23] they never ate in the center looking
[38:27] like this sad or mad how would you like
[38:33] to answer this thing maybe order do you
[38:38] like it don't do two brothers went down
[38:40] there they don't film in the COFA little
[38:43] brother away from here to get him
[38:44] offered totally go to motel a couple of
[38:47] brothers got home till they said why
[38:49] don't why didn't you take him on a week
[38:50] and snow it'd be quite a manly man left
[38:56] I said that man had just been in the
[38:59] brothers house that seemed over here to
[39:00] get rid of him for over 30 days the next
[39:05] time you pull one of them deals in front
[39:07] of me with somebody up I'll send them
[39:09] home with you we don't want that no
[39:12] problem but you see our actions reacting
[39:20] how'd you like to talk to preachers
[39:21] let's say and they said you wanted six
[39:26] and once it when it sleeps
[39:35] woman
[39:40] what do we display I'm actually having
[39:47] to say don't they believe must be in
[39:50] preach I said I don't know
[40:00] because their actions and reactions
[40:02] never tell me whether they are
[40:13] actions react something you never give
[40:18] an IV in no matter what
[40:27] what's your act you know to sit there
[40:32] stone-faced and there amen
[40:34] you're saving something wrong what the
[40:37] preachers say now you tell me how I'm
[40:43] going tell you yes that I'm Toki here if
[40:45] you come my office on tape same thing I
[40:49] don't know what some of you believe
[40:51] because I can't determine by your facial
[40:54] expression and your actions and react
[41:04] you're making a statement you dress a
[41:09] certain way you walk a certain way you
[41:12] act a certain way you make a mistake no
[41:21] brothers come in the breach you ain't
[41:22] mean you accept a minute
[41:23] I never even need to hurt somebody gave
[41:32] me an arrow okay because you didn't
[41:40] listen to all of the been saying what
[41:45] about what our actions displayed what is
[41:52] it that we're trying to get the people
[41:54] to see you realize you're actually
[42:01] saying this is what I believe Jesus
[42:02] would do
[42:10] my say I had these notes and pains a
[42:13] long time so not like a proverb that I
[42:17] don't do it like it
[42:25] I wake on this type of missions
[42:31] until it becomes a burden on me as an
[42:33] actually delivers can I admit about the
[42:36] time that I deliver strongly Hummer
[42:37] I admit it'll be like other preachers it
[42:44] just bring in certain things at certain
[42:46] things you know the new messages I just
[42:49] never had been built in web sorry but
[42:52] then I get a message that bears on me
[42:54] then I deliver it then I have to live
[42:57] with what I deliver whatever action
[43:04] children
[43:09] you know that it would be a shame and a
[43:11] disgrace for them to ask me to run for
[43:18] president in the United States what have
[43:22] you made me in that statement but what
[43:25] would have happened if you have asked
[43:36] see folks I get letters from a lot of
[43:41] places
[43:46] denominational place
[43:50] Gainesville area everything they have I
[43:53] get a notice you know I'm talking about
[43:57] religious events let's enter into
[43:58] gatherings of the Brethren to do in the
[44:01] dead I don't never go there well you

[44:12] far gone that's problem every time that
[44:18] Kingdom takes most of you know what it
[44:20] is when the biggest suppliers in the
[44:23] country of religious material etcetera
[44:25] you know that they call me all the time
[44:28] and in fact me to come the meetings that
[44:32] they're having in the state of Georgia
[44:39] but you know I'd be hypocrite no cousin
[44:41] wouldn't now more Dumbledore go come on
[44:47] you see I don't want to be a hypocrite
[44:48] and go shut down and make fun of them
[44:50] and a lot of them I wouldn't do it for
[44:52] nothing in the world but what would you
[44:58] do
[45:02] I'm invited to go anywhere just almost
[45:04] in the world overseas especially to
[45:07] preach in this message
[45:16] but you see I realize and know that
[45:19] that's not gonna work but I'm not made
[45:25] that way
[45:29] brother said to me just the other day he
[45:31] said you don't go very many places and
[45:35] preach to the announcer to preach at

[46:03] just talked about but must be lived and
[46:08] they don't like it they want to know
[46:11] what your input is than the words you
[46:15] ask somebody what is their input isn't a
[46:16] lot of times it means that you you don't
[46:20] know where you're at don't ask me what
[46:26] the input isn't actually what the
[46:27] prophet sav the maximum wants my idea of
[46:31] what the Prophet said asked me what he

[52:29] he still had the looks he wants our
[52:37] statements money how do we live around

[1:04:32] you're making the statement I like to
[1:04:36] wait there I said it about the election

[1:04:42] you miss when the elections for pastor
[1:04:44] come we don't have to have an election
[1:04:48] for passenger according to the Prophet
[1:04:51] according to the state of Georgia and
[1:04:53] the rules we regulate under we must

[1:05:28] was we going through that time we were
[1:05:30] talking about building on out here
[1:05:31] and doing it over that way and fixing it
[1:05:34] he's the only one who got the building
[1:05:35] that said I don't agree with you he let
[1:05:38] it be known he didn't agree with me I
[1:05:40] never had no problem you know what we
[1:05:41] didn't do that we wouldn't count him
[1:05:44] another thing happened with lease he
[1:05:47] stated his statement he made each day
[1:05:50] but I don't agree with with my meeting
[1:05:54] over to hit every day on the foofy about
[1:05:56] it you don't notice me sometimes folks
[1:06:04] I'll spend right here on two or three
[1:06:06] different occasions and made this
[1:06:11] statement let's see if you'll remember
[1:06:12] it I'd be right in the middle of the
[1:06:15] sermon that stop and say I forgive you
[1:06:21] what do you think I'm talking about
[1:06:27] I'm forgiving you because of your
[1:06:29] studying that you're right we have a lot
[1:06:35] of advance money will come
[1:06:38] one brother one time said like this
[1:06:40] don't make me no more spiritual cover
[1:06:41] don't go no we don't make you no more
[1:06:44] spiritual coffee if you want but does it
[1:06:48] make you more spiritual or not don't
[1:06:49] need you go somewheres out
[1:06:56] come on does that make you more
[1:06:58] spiritual cross she went somewhere else
[1:07:00] because he didn't down know what up
[1:07:12] some of you have made it plain that you
[1:07:16] did not agree with those ship meetings
[1:07:18] that we have teens and participating
[1:07:26] I've never said a word about that
[1:07:28] anything wrong we the only major state
[1:07:33] there's a pastor of this church we agree
[1:07:37] with fellowship
[1:07:42] but a lot of you tonight above if you
[1:07:44] didn't agree with it you might have to
[1:07:47] help you might have done them in here
[1:07:52] but they're the only thing question I
[1:07:54] ask you this is making more stir for if
[1:07:57] you don't come to throw at me
[1:07:58] where you go out to some worthy event
[1:08:00] what we're having stir we're having to
[1:08:02] focus me come on the day big line
[1:08:22] the Prophet said you'll cause the church
[1:08:25] to bitterly fight
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:32] we're feel strong with a real strong
[1:08:33] about tonight coming up here to be
[1:08:35] prayed for we don't want the kids
[1:08:37] running around man reactions and actions
[1:08:39] back in the back and do it on brain go
[1:08:42] to the hindrance
[1:08:49] but what about the starfish attitudes
[1:08:51] most of the time what is that's much
[1:08:55] kinder this year now as I get to that
[1:08:59] while ago I hope you caught it if you do
[1:09:03] wrong you gotta come to the church and
[1:09:08] that's the church forgive you can't go
[1:09:12] to God and ask him to forgive you so
[1:09:14] then the prophets right now why would he
[1:09:18] make that statement he's at Ana the day
[1:09:20] of judgment you have to give an account
[1:09:24] I thought we believe we're going into
[1:09:26] rapture there's nothing to get slammed
[1:09:30] born in a rapture does that change what
[1:09:34] he said
[1:09:39] what about it though they've been
[1:09:43] ridiculing a lot by the way he does
[1:09:45] things in this church and I don't have
[1:09:48] to answer you don't have to I'm a fan
[1:09:54] I'll have to give an account for those
[1:09:56] signs but when I try it's not making a
[1:10:03] statement today let's don't talk about
[1:10:08] the rapture here we get where we can
[1:10:11] live
[1:10:22] so you can all make intersection of
[1:10:24] American Fisher's so what's our
[1:10:27] confession our confession to their
[1:10:31] statements I come here every Sunday in
[1:10:34] priests and I felt like a statement to
[1:10:36] you about what I believe the Bible is
[1:10:41] means and I give you the reason I make
[1:10:48] those statements because this woman just
[1:10:53] got to do with that on the doctrines
[1:10:55] reason I don't believe them be ready to
[1:10:57] give an answer the reason I hope
[1:10:58] realizing it you ready to give a
[1:11:00] statement that's when we don't have a
[1:11:05] lot of trouble with people coming in
[1:11:06] here bringing in those they already know
[1:11:10] our statements but now you're gonna hold
[1:11:17] on to this one doctrine is not going to
[1:11:20] put us in the rapture hold your wording
[1:11:26] revealed word will put us in the rapture
[1:11:30] not a doctrine a doctrine is not a
[1:11:34] revealed word revealed word is a live
[1:11:38] Christ that will put us in the rapture
[1:11:49] when I first thing I asked the last have
[1:11:55] we handed our by our actions and
[1:11:57] reactions have we hindered someone else
[1:12:07] we Bend a lot of fellowship meetings and
[1:12:09] pains
[1:12:15] one time I mean but somebody said he'll
[1:12:18] never work
[1:12:19] well the next statement they made was
[1:12:21] outlandishly wrong you know see I didn't
[1:12:27] know this put them together I was a Amen
[1:12:29] in the statement prior you know in other
[1:12:32] words we'd say like you know I believe
[1:12:34] in one crude living God and I'd say Amen
[1:12:36] but it's really God in three persons now
[1:12:39] I didn't even agree with that name I
[1:12:44] agreed with the statement you know some
[1:12:46] of the people asked me coming home at
[1:12:48] night I said well you ain't me and what
[1:12:53] that brother say well you know what I
[1:12:58] found out then you ever go to church and

[1:13:28] sure hope you don't get that away but I
[1:13:32] believe you do because you're looking
[1:13:36] around a lot of times wondering what

[1:18:42] that goodbye
[1:18:46] no wonder they say we're not different
[1:18:48] anybody and I agree with them except for
[1:18:53] one time we've got to desire to hear
[1:18:57] God's work have been based upon faith
[1:19:01] cometh by hearing and believe in the
[1:19:05] Word of God never claimed to be holy and

[1:26:27] is back here across this pulpit I said
