[1:14] hly yes Lord Jesus how many wants to see
[1:17] him amen look around you're looking at
[1:19] him the brides right here we're here
[1:23] amen amen it's a great honor and
[1:26] privilege to be here brother D spoke
[1:29] with my wife a few years ago in total
[1:31] that's two or three places and I knew my
[1:35] father-in-law and my my grandpa thought
[1:37] of you and brother Homer and brother JT
[1:40] and so well and I thought you know God I
[1:43] don't I don't never desire to be
[1:44] anything big he said just be in your
[1:47] place amen and do what you asked me to
[1:49] do but that was a heart's desire of mine
[1:51] and to be at a meeting like this it's
[1:54] it's touching to me I I really
[1:56] appreciate it and yall pray that some of
[1:58] my nerves are slide out the way my
[2:00] wife's had to put up with me for two
[2:02] weeks scared to death so y'all be with
[2:06] me uh and pray with me you want to turn
[2:08] to 1 Corinthians 12 and 2 I read two or
[2:13] three scriptures here and then we'll let
[2:14] you be
[2:16] seated I thought brother JT was going to
[2:19] just go ahead and preach what I had laid
[2:21] on my
[2:22] heart I titled this a living God Amen
[2:27] and our brother Homer hit a couple of
[2:29] things over the last couple weeks it's
[2:30] just kind of really brought this
[2:32] together and really in inspired it on my
[2:35] heart and I believe I believe we all
[2:36] need to see a living God I look around
[2:39] and I was talking to a friend at work
[2:41] and we just talking and he don't claim
[2:43] to be a Christian at all and even he
[2:46] makes the comment I just want to see
[2:48] something real I I can look at the
[2:50] Baptist I can look at the Methodist I
[2:52] can look but show me something real show
[2:55] me something that God's moving today
[2:58] like he was then
[3:00] and then I just heard I think last
[3:01] yesterday evening on the way home from
[3:03] work or out in the yard I had the iPod
[3:05] on and I heard brother Brandon make a
[3:07] statement on the message thirst and he
[3:09] makes a statement and he he he says that
[3:12] statement he says you know if you you
[3:13] you say that you would do something if
[3:16] you lived in Jesus's day right he said
[3:18] you do live in Jesus's day his word is
[3:21] being fulfilled today the same as it was
[3:24] in the body then is the same as it is
[3:26] today and if you won't do it today you
[3:29] wouldn't did it then you would have
[3:31] crucified him then just like you would
[3:33] today so I think First Corinthians
[3:36] here chap 12: 2 and it says you know you
[3:40] were Gentiles carried away unto these
[3:43] dumb Idols even as you were
[3:46] LED and I thought that was us you turn
[3:48] over to 1 Thessalonians
[3:51] 1:9 I thought us being Gentiles we look
[3:54] for something to fill we look for
[3:56] something to touch the Gentile Nation
[3:59] always looked for something they could
[4:01] feel something they could touch a image
[4:03] of gold or something 1 Thessalonians 1:9
[4:07] says for they themselves show us of what
[4:10] manner of entering in we had unto you
[4:12] and know that you turned to God from
[4:16] Idols to serve the living and true God
[4:20] what caused them to turn they saw
[4:22] something real right they would didn't
[4:25] see another put on they didn't see
[4:27] another example that could they saw
[4:29] something real
[4:30] and a living God amongst them and turn
[4:32] over to Matthew 16-16 very
[4:35] familiar they sitting there is they
[4:37] sitting there and Jesus asked his what
[4:38] does men say the son of man am and
[4:42] Peter's answer he says and Simon Peter
[4:45] answered and said there art the Christ
[4:48] the son of the Living God what caused
[4:51] him to see that by Revelation he saw it
[4:54] but what made him see is because he saw
[4:56] God glory living in flesh right
[5:00] and if we can't see God living in flesh
[5:02] today what Have We Done Right we've
[5:04] turned the whole word of God into
[5:07] another example or into another story
[5:10] and brother brandham says says neither
[5:12] can we be saved by historical God we
[5:14] cannot add
[5:16] to we cannot add the joy of the
[5:18] Pentecostal fire unless it's the same
[5:20] fire today we cannot serve a historical
[5:23] God and what God is what good is it to
[5:26] you the God that was in Christ he isn't
[5:29] the same God today that he promised to
[5:31] be then these scriptures friends now
[5:34] Shake Yourself a little bit don't be
[5:36] Emer just wake up right yourself are
[5:39] second it's the truth right and I
[5:41] thought of that and what good would this
[5:44] message the are be if he wasn't a living
[5:46] God right exactly if he wasn't amongst
[5:49] us if he wouldn't do the same for me and
[5:51] you right that he did for our Prophet
[5:54] what good would it be right because then
[5:56] it would make his own word void and a
[5:59] lie
[6:00] just say a word of prayer Lord Jesus we
[6:02] asked you Lord to Lord to come Lord
[6:04] somehow Lord Jesus and use a a vessel
[6:06] Lord speak something in your word Lord
[6:09] Jesus that you may encourage us Lord to
[6:11] let us see that you're living amongst us
[6:13] Lord Jesus bless these words Lord bless
[6:17] the thoughts you laid on My Heart Lord
[6:19] be with us in your name we pray amen you
[6:22] be
[6:25] seated but I thought of that and I
[6:27] thought as I talked a couple weeks ago I
[6:29] S that talking with my friend and he
[6:30] says just give me something real yeah
[6:33] just give me something alive yeah and I
[6:36] looked you know and and and I looked up
[6:38] I'm not a smart person but living there
[6:40] means alive it means fresh right it
[6:43] means active it means right now it don't
[6:47] mean tell stories we we've talked about
[6:49] it we we talk about all the stories that
[6:52] brother Brenham did in his meetings we
[6:54] talk about all the things that brother
[6:55] Brenham did and we tell them but what
[6:58] good is that to my children
[7:00] what good is that to my generation we
[7:02] wasn't alive in the 60s we don't know
[7:05] what it was to live in the 60s we don't
[7:07] know them circumstances what is God
[7:09] today doing what is he doing amongst us
[7:11] today I I look at different ones and and
[7:14] going to Camp you know and having the
[7:16] talk with Sarah them about Amy look at a
[7:18] living God stand before us look at a
[7:22] living God look at your life talk of
[7:24] your life and I think of that I think
[7:27] what what must we do to have the Living
[7:30] God living in us what must we do and
[7:34] it's the same as it always but God's
[7:35] word never changes he said to Matthew 7
[7:38] he says You must be born again it's very
[7:41] simple you can't go on half-heartedly
[7:43] you can't go on half serious you got to
[7:46] be sincere with God you got to come
[7:48] before him in Acts 238 and you got to
[7:50] repent and that's not just come to an
[7:52] altar and say oh God I need to be better
[7:54] right that's not just come to an altar
[7:56] and say oh God I wish I could be like so
[7:58] and so yeah no we want to be like Christ
[8:01] we want to see that Living God that
[8:02] lived through him live through us we
[8:05] want to see it to a point that our
[8:07] brothers Peter stood there and say you
[8:09] are the son of the Living God there's no
[8:11] question we want that amongst ourselves
[8:13] that we see each other look and say
[8:15] brother Dale you have to be a child of
[8:17] the Living God your life vindicates who
[8:20] you are God is living because of you God
[8:24] is living because of me and you God is
[8:27] alive today but he's alive in our hearts
[8:30] and I think of that it says acts 238
[8:33] says be baptized and you shall receive
[8:35] the Holy
[8:36] Ghost that's his Spirit that's not one
[8:39] another spirit I look around and I see
[8:41] so many people says well I just want to
[8:43] be like this brother or I just want to
[8:45] be like I want to be like Christ I don't
[8:48] want to be like nobody but Christ I want
[8:51] him to live through me so much G that
[8:54] that that you can see it when I enter a
[8:56] room you can see my God enter the room
[8:58] with me
[8:59] each one of us has got to get to that
[9:02] and I look at that and I think what does
[9:04] it take takes a complete
[9:07] surrender it takes a complete surrender
[9:10] away from everything this person wants
[9:13] why is it that we can look at the other
[9:14] denominations and we can look at other
[9:16] churches and we don't see a real God
[9:19] because Saturday it's all about football
[9:21] then Sunday it's all about God and then
[9:24] Monday it's all about getting promoted
[9:26] and then Tuesday it's all about how much
[9:27] money I can make and then Wednesday they
[9:29] all we back to church no God lives seven
[9:32] days a week he's with us every day of
[9:34] the week he's with us in everything that
[9:37] we do that's the live God the God is
[9:40] that when you're at your most
[9:41] inconvenient time God nudges your heart
[9:45] and you answer to him you answer to him
[9:47] no matter what circumstances is going on
[9:49] the job's falling apart around you but
[9:52] you feel God and I was talking to a
[9:54] brother this morning and I jotted it
[9:55] down and he he he was listening to a
[9:57] message and he he texted to me he said
[10:00] brother bham says may you get so lost in
[10:03] Christ that he can simply knot his head
[10:07] and you're ready to
[10:08] go he don't have to and you know brother
[10:11] Brenham goes on down when he says that
[10:12] he says not have to be pushed around
[10:14] like me and I thought what about this
[10:17] this is our Prophet this is the one that
[10:19] we claim has brought the angel the
[10:21] message and he has but even he said
[10:25] don't be like me and have to be pushed
[10:26] around by God be so in tune with God let
[10:30] God live through your everyday life that
[10:32] in the worst situation all he has to do
[10:35] is knot his head right and you're ready
[10:37] for battle and you're ready for battle
[10:40] but you got to be in tune with God for
[10:42] that you can't get caught away with all
[10:44] of the life and the carage you can't get
[10:46] caught away with everything going on
[10:47] around you you got to give it to God and
[10:51] you got to say you know they say well
[10:53] well you know we got yeah but how many
[10:55] of us is really wanting find things here
[10:59] and to lose heaven what's our struggle
[11:02] what do we
[11:03] want you know I I I saw a little
[11:05] demonstration one time and and the guy
[11:08] had a rope and this rope wrapped around
[11:10] the church building and on the end of it
[11:13] was about an inch with tape on it and he
[11:17] says all of us are more concerned about
[11:19] this inch of our life than we are the
[11:23] eternity in heaven we get so caught
[11:27] up we in includes me we get so caught up
[11:31] with the daily carries we get so caught
[11:33] up with trying to better oursel that we
[11:35] lose focus on God that's why God can't
[11:39] live through us that's why God's asking
[11:41] us be born again that's why Jesus said
[11:45] you must be born again there's no other
[11:47] way lose who you are and gain Christ
[11:51] once born again we are manifested Sons
[11:54] and Daughters of God we are fulfilling
[11:57] his scripture you know I think of that
[11:58] and I think you know look look down
[12:00] Through the Ages I think of uh coming up
[12:02] I was speaking to my wife about the Book
[12:03] of Daniel and I was looking at Daniel
[12:06] and how the king chose Daniel Shadrach
[12:09] mesach and abendigo he picked them out
[12:12] to be in their position he lifted them
[12:15] up into appointments he laid the people
[12:17] look up to him because of their God but
[12:20] it just wasn't just a few days and now
[12:23] all of a sudden he's wanting to kill him
[12:25] again all of a sudden Daniel prays and
[12:28] he prayed to another God and he wants to
[12:29] kill Daniel or this and don't do this or
[12:33] or this and don't bow but it always
[12:35] turns back the king never got born again
[12:39] he got blessed from being around Daniel
[12:41] and the people when he saw it he
[12:43] couldn't deny it he says you're you are
[12:45] you serve the god of the Living God you
[12:47] serve the only true God but what was it
[12:50] he never got born again right he got
[12:53] touched he got blessed he got a miracle
[12:57] happened before his eyes he got turned
[12:59] towards God but he never went out the
[13:02] way and I look and I think and I look
[13:04] around and I talk to different and I I I
[13:07] just I love young people and I talk to
[13:08] kids and I and I look and I say God
[13:10] that's that's what we're lacking today
[13:13] we're raised in the message we know the
[13:15] scripture we know the quotes we know all
[13:17] of this we know we know that brother
[13:19] Brenham did this we know that Jesus did
[13:21] this we know we know that you're
[13:23] supposed to come to the altar so we come
[13:24] to the altar out of
[13:26] obligation We Lay It an altar that's
[13:29] what our parents told us that we had to
[13:30] do we get baptized because the Pastor
[13:33] said you needed to be baptized but it's
[13:35] never sunk into our heart we've not been
[13:38] born again come on and I look you know I
[13:40] think once you born again you can't wait
[13:43] to be
[13:44] baptized you can't wait to be filled
[13:47] with the Holy Ghost and you'll do
[13:49] whatever it takes I look at amen I I
[13:52] look at I look at a football player and
[13:53] a football player would take an NFL
[13:56] football player he plays 7even months
[13:58] eight months what whatever it is but
[13:59] it's a 365 day of fire with him every
[14:03] day he gets up on a strict diet every
[14:05] day he's got a strict workout plan
[14:07] because he wants to be the best what
[14:09] about Christians do we live every day of
[14:12] our life wanting to be the best
[14:14] Christian what about Christians what do
[14:17] we do what do we do do we do we struggle
[14:19] along and woe is me and excuse after
[14:23] excuse or do we wake up every morning
[14:25] and say God I'm a child of a king and
[14:28] God you know you live through me and I
[14:32] know you're going to live through me
[14:34] today now what can I do for you today
[14:37] I'm at your service I'm reporting for
[14:39] Duty what what can you do for me today
[14:42] and I think you know Paul says but uh
[14:45] greater is he that's in us than he
[14:47] that's in the world brother Homer
[14:49] preached a message the other night that
[14:50] just touched me so much because you read
[14:53] with brother Brenham says we're not
[14:54] getting this so I don't think we
[14:56] understand this we in catching
[14:59] revelation of that we've read it and
[15:01] it's become common to us we know what it
[15:03] says we all can quote greater is he
[15:05] that's in than me than gr than him
[15:07] that's in the world but you know what
[15:09] that means that means there's a living
[15:11] God living in your soul that means
[15:13] there's nothing that can turn you down
[15:16] that means that you can stand on his
[15:17] word and and you take back to Shadrach
[15:19] mesek and ab bandigo and he says we not
[15:22] we not careful to question to answer you
[15:24] King we're not careful to answer you
[15:26] because we know our God is the Living
[15:28] God
[15:29] and we know if he wants to keep us out
[15:31] of the fire he'll keep us but if not he
[15:33] wants us to go home so here I am
[15:35] persecute me here I am put me through a
[15:38] trial but no we don't want to do that no
[15:42] no we don't we don't want fights but to
[15:44] be victorious you must fight to be
[15:47] victorious you must fight and I think of
[15:49] Shadrach M and bendy go there and I
[15:51] think of their life and I I think of the
[15:53] position they're in there and I think
[15:55] how often we we refer back to that that
[15:57] story we we refer back to that story and
[15:59] what it means to us but you know if they
[16:02] wasn't willing to do it that' never been
[16:03] a story that's right that's right if
[16:06] they wasn't so caught up with
[16:08] God they could have never had a win a
[16:11] victory like that that's right if they
[16:13] wasn't so caught up in in what God was
[16:15] doing in that
[16:17] day they would have probably bowed down
[16:19] and asked for forgiveness later and
[16:21] would have never got that story but that
[16:24] story was given for you and I that we
[16:26] might know that in this day right we can
[16:29] stand up that's right that we can stand
[16:31] up and we can say on your word I Stand
[16:33] Alone God on your word you said this is
[16:36] right though the world's against me
[16:38] though everything here is is forsaken me
[16:41] I'm going to stand on your word and you
[16:43] said you would be here with me you said
[16:45] you'd be here but he can't come until
[16:48] you do that that's right he can't live
[16:50] amongst us until we take a stand for him
[16:52] that's right he can't come into your
[16:54] heart until you take a stand for him
[16:56] that's right what it says acts 238 says
[16:58] you you shall receive it but he didn't
[17:00] say when you'd receive it brother
[17:02] Brenham said he'd put you to the test
[17:04] he'd say if you
[17:06] serious how many of us we don't get it
[17:08] immediately and next thing you know
[17:09] we're right back in the world oh well
[17:11] maybe they're not right back in the
[17:12] world but maybe we just go back to that
[17:14] bitter Spirit or maybe we go back to
[17:16] that jealousy maybe we go back to the
[17:18] little things that hunt us oh my but
[17:21] look at us we must first make that step
[17:24] God needs you and I to take that step he
[17:27] needs you and I to step on that Faith
[17:29] even when we don't know what we're doing
[17:30] right he needs you and I to step out
[17:32] there and say God you you said I'm here
[17:35] now what would you have me do and depend
[17:38] on him to give it I says what's what
[17:41] stops us from doing that
[17:44] unbelief because we really don't believe
[17:46] what we're saying we
[17:48] believe I look and I think you
[17:50] know it's so easy to repeat the words
[17:54] God I love you but do I mean it right
[17:59] do I do I really mean it because to love
[18:02] somebody you want to give you all for
[18:04] them when me and my wife got married I
[18:07] you know you know I didn't even care
[18:08] about me for a while I just wanted her
[18:11] happy I just wanted her
[18:13] happy I wanted to to do something
[18:17] because I had to win her away from her
[18:18] daddy and that wasn't
[18:20] easy so I had to do something to make
[18:23] her love me I didn't realize the whole
[18:25] time that that love went the other way
[18:27] that she was doing the same for me
[18:30] but God loves you am and God desires to
[18:34] give everything he has unto
[18:37] you than but do you love him that much
[18:41] look at our examine ourselves and look
[18:42] at our own daily lives do we really give
[18:45] to
[18:46] him we don't oh my I got down on the bed
[18:50] last night and prayed and I got through
[18:53] and my wife says God forgive us for our
[18:55] slowful cuz do we really pray that
[18:57] sincer sinly every night or there's so
[19:00] many nights it's to lay you down and say
[19:02] oh God help us let us deep good we'll
[19:05] see you in Tom morning
[19:07] Lord I'm
[19:11] human do we really love him with
[19:13] everything in us right do we really
[19:16] desire to give him our all come on or
[19:19] just what we want to give him that's
[19:21] right because if you're only wanting to
[19:23] give him what you want to give him he
[19:24] can't live through you that's right he's
[19:26] got to have your full being that's right
[19:28] he's got to have everything about you
[19:31] he's got to have your thoughts he's got
[19:32] to have your desires he's got to have
[19:34] your wishes he's got to have your
[19:36] difficulties he even wants them but we
[19:39] got to give them to him he says he's
[19:42] laying there just dying to heal you but
[19:44] you won't ask right and then you might
[19:47] ask but you don't believe right he's
[19:49] waiting on you to get in line with him
[19:51] so that he can give it to you right he
[19:54] desires to be a living God amongst his
[19:56] flesh he says I'll never be without a
[19:57] witness
[19:58] his bride is his witness today his bride
[20:01] is been is a spoken word before the
[20:03] foundation of the world it was spoken
[20:05] that'd be a bride in this day that would
[20:07] not that would not sin that would not
[20:10] fall away from God that would hold true
[20:12] would not be deceived and would Rapture
[20:14] out of here that's his word and his word
[20:17] has to be manifested that's right he
[20:19] cannot
[20:21] lie I think unbelief or doubt we doubt
[20:25] him why do we doubt him we doubt him
[20:27] because of our our own reasons and
[20:29] intellect sure we get
[20:31] cancer the doctor says you're going to
[20:33] die in 6 months we go okay I'm going to
[20:38] die and we've doubted God now because
[20:41] God said cancer is nothing it's just
[20:43] another Affliction put your confidence
[20:45] in me and let me live through you let me
[20:48] make you a living example that all your
[20:51] family you know they may they they may
[20:53] think you're crazy for believing that
[20:55] cult they may think you're crazy for
[20:58] following that man but when it comes to
[21:00] God healed you of that cancer they going
[21:02] well something's up there God did
[21:04] something for you there there's a living
[21:07] God manifested to us there's a living
[21:09] God manifested amongst us if we'll let
[21:13] him and I thought the other thing is as
[21:16] our own
[21:17] intellect we become so smart that we use
[21:21] our intellect to reason out of the
[21:23] blessings of
[21:24] God we've become so smart
[21:28] that we can't even take him at his word
[21:30] anymore somebody comes up and says you
[21:32] know the Bible says that by my stripes
[21:34] you was healed and our own intellect
[21:36] says yeah but he also said that no no no
[21:40] no he didn't say he said by my stripes
[21:43] you heal stand on it and see if God
[21:46] don't heal you brother Brenham said in
[21:48] 62 hear you himm he said if you notice
[21:51] before Israel was caught out of Egypt
[21:54] Moses had tried to do that believing he
[21:56] was the person and and that was G that
[21:58] was to give the message see there's
[22:00] there's Moses Here Comes Moses and Moses
[22:02] knew he had a revelation that he was him
[22:05] he was the man to give the message but
[22:08] he tried to do it with his own
[22:10] will by an intellectual
[22:13] standpoint but before the time was
[22:17] right and I think you know I've did the
[22:20] same
[22:21] thing I've seen God move I've seen God
[22:25] tell me stuff and I've rushed into it
[22:27] that's right and I waited on his
[22:29] time and it falls apart like it did in
[22:32] Moses here and I think that and I think
[22:34] you know 1957 I come across brother Bram
[22:37] said he says there's two fraction of
[22:39] this message one's going to get stiff
[22:41] starchy and
[22:42] inct stiff starchy and
[22:47] intellect and I look around and I think
[22:49] yeah that's you know all this craziness
[22:52] that's coming against the bride that's
[22:53] that's what they are that's right every
[22:55] time you try to say the prophet said
[22:57] this they said yeah but the the prophet
[22:58] said this yeah but I've read this yeah
[23:00] yeah but the prophet said this against
[23:02] that and they try to conict his words
[23:04] with their own intellect
[23:06] on he says the other side of what Plum
[23:08] over the deep end Lord and I think look
[23:11] at our time this was 1957 he made that
[23:16] statement he was a prophet he was a
[23:18] Seer he saw where this message was
[23:21] headed to he saw that there was a true
[23:24] message there was a true bride but he
[23:26] also saw that and you look at it today
[23:29] and it don't take a genius to look
[23:30] around and see what they've done with
[23:33] this message they've tried to take it
[23:35] brother Brenham said many times other
[23:36] than that he said if if the devil can't
[23:38] get you to come out he'll push you
[23:40] overboard right and what have they done
[23:42] with it theyve pushed it
[23:45] overboard he goes on down he says but
[23:47] when the time got right and and
[23:49] and there was a visitor came from heaven
[23:53] and it was God
[23:54] himself and he came in the burning bush
[23:57] and he spoke to Moses and he sent him
[23:59] out I believe that every man before he
[24:01] goes on the field to preach the gospel
[24:03] ought to First have that experience with
[24:05] God it goes on down he says and he he
[24:08] quotes the scripture that be high-m
[24:09] minded lovers of Pleasures more than
[24:11] lovers of God and I've read that
[24:13] scripture so many times and just
[24:16] recently it's really started Dawning on
[24:17] me where are we at look around not in
[24:22] the denominations look around in the
[24:24] message what have we done we become so
[24:27] spiritual we become so highminded in our
[24:30] own knowledge we become so
[24:33] big that we forgot God that we've left
[24:37] him out of it it goes on there he says
[24:39] and they've got intellectual Giants in
[24:41] the world today they can almost explain
[24:44] away everything that God said to be true
[24:47] they can take it from a theological
[24:49] standpoint
[24:51] intellectually and if you just take your
[24:54] own mind of
[24:56] thinking reasoning like Eve did from the
[24:59] beginning they can explain everything of
[25:02] the Bible away from you that's right
[25:04] it's like a conversation I had with a
[25:06] friend fellow Minister friend of mine
[25:08] and I was telling him I says without a
[25:10] revelation all of our intellect is
[25:12] nothing that's right I say me and you as
[25:15] friends could take one off the street
[25:18] and we could set him in an office with
[25:20] you and you could with your the elect
[25:22] with your intellect you could convince
[25:25] him that baptism in Jesus name is
[25:27] correct
[25:28] and I said but then give me 30 minutes
[25:31] and with my intellect I could convince
[25:33] him his father Son and Holy Ghost but it
[25:35] takes a revelation from God and to give
[25:38] that Revelation you've got to give him
[25:39] all you're you got to give everything
[25:42] and he goes on down and he says but if a
[25:44] man or a woman has ever been on the
[25:46] backside of the desert in those sacred
[25:48] sins will no intellectual can stand and
[25:52] they'll come in contact with the Living
[25:54] God no devil or scientist or anything
[25:58] else can ever explain that
[26:00] away you were there it happened you know
[26:04] it's the truth nothing can take that
[26:06] away from you anymore if you ever have
[26:09] that experience and I look around and I
[26:10] think that's what's wrong with us we're
[26:12] not getting that true experience we're
[26:15] getting a good pat on the back and God
[26:17] loves you but we're not really falling
[26:19] back into a prayer and asking God to
[26:21] take us to the backside of the desert
[26:24] take us to the depths of nothing and
[26:26] start over take giv I had Paul said I
[26:29] counted all of it as D that's right to
[26:31] start over in Christ and I was talking
[26:33] to a brother the day and I think that's
[26:34] where I was that's where I was I was
[26:36] raised in this message under brother
[26:38] Carol could not ask for a better Pastor
[26:40] for my whole life but until God got a
[26:43] hold of me it meant
[26:45] nothing and before God got a hold of me
[26:48] there wasn't a living God in Me all
[26:51] there was was a walking figurehead that
[26:54] I could quote the message that I could
[26:56] quote the scripture that I could tell
[26:57] you brother Brenham said this that I
[26:59] could tell you that the Bible said this
[27:01] but there was nothing real about me I
[27:04] was no more than a Baptist a Methodist a
[27:07] Pentecostal a Catholic whatever it might
[27:10] be I just read it a little different but
[27:13] I was the same thing as they was but
[27:15] then when God got a hold of me I found
[27:18] out that as Paul did I had to count all
[27:20] of that yes as
[27:21] dung it didn't mean nothing no more
[27:24] because you know what it's hard to
[27:26] receive a revelation when you know
[27:29] something
[27:31] already oh
[27:32] yeah and I look around and I think here
[27:35] we are we've been bred on this message
[27:39] and we've been told since we was a year
[27:42] old the baptism in Jesus name is correct
[27:45] but do you have a revelation of that
[27:47] right come on is it really sealed in
[27:50] your soul what you just been
[27:53] told we look around and we look at the
[27:55] things and says why I believe in in
[27:57] predestination why come on brother do
[28:00] you believe in predestination because
[28:02] there's a God that lives today revealed
[28:06] that to you or do you believe in
[28:08] predestination because that's what your
[28:10] pastor preached about all these years
[28:12] come on it's so hard for somebody to
[28:15] reveal something to you when you already
[28:17] know it
[28:18] exactly and I look in our own lives and
[28:20] I look in the business world and I look
[28:22] in our jobs it's the same way you take a
[28:25] carpenter that in his mind he knows how
[28:29] to turn a
[28:30] corner it's hard to teach him how to
[28:32] turn that
[28:34] corner because he's not
[28:36] listening in his head he's going yeah I
[28:38] know how to do that what you showing me
[28:41] for but let him get down
[28:44] desperate let him get on his knees
[28:46] somewhere and let him realize that he
[28:48] really don't
[28:49] know and let him realize that you know
[28:52] God didn't make him the greatest
[28:53] Carpenter that's right and there's out
[28:55] there there's out there ones that are
[28:56] better then you can teach him
[29:00] something and I look at our everyday
[29:02] lives and I think that's where we're at
[29:04] it's hard to teach intellectual Giants
[29:08] how to love
[29:09] God because they sit back there and they
[29:11] go well yep yep he's preaching about
[29:13] that one yep hey are you listening over
[29:15] there he's preaching about you hey you
[29:17] know you know he's
[29:19] preach no he's preaching to you right
[29:22] he's who he's preaching to exactly he's
[29:24] preaching to you that has said on
[29:25] message fuse for 30 40 years right but
[29:28] you've never moved any closer to God
[29:30] right he's preaching to you that's been
[29:32] on the message fuse for 40 years but yet
[29:35] nobody sees a living God in you I was
[29:37] talking to another brother and he went
[29:38] to work for this place and it was with
[29:41] another brother there was a good
[29:43] brother it didn't take three weeks
[29:45] before the manager caught him in the
[29:47] office and he said something to him he
[29:49] says I thought y'all went to the same
[29:51] church well we do oh Lord so well he's
[29:55] been he said he's been going there for
[29:56] 40 years years and he never acted like
[30:01] this one of them had a living God in
[30:03] them
[30:04] right one of them had a true Revelation
[30:07] that he was a child of God and he
[30:11] couldn't help it when you really get
[30:13] that Revelation that God died on that
[30:16] cross for
[30:18] you that God's stripes on his back was
[30:21] for your
[30:23] healing that God suffered through all
[30:26] vanity through all Temptations for
[30:30] you won you really believe that it'll
[30:32] change you you won't be the same person
[30:35] that walked into the office the day
[30:37] before you don't have to say
[30:40] nothing I work with guys all the time
[30:43] and they look and you know it didn't
[30:45] take
[30:46] um my we had a new boss come down out of
[30:49] Michigan big boss and you know when they
[30:50] have these office meetings all the big
[30:53] boss first thing they want to do is buy
[30:54] a toast for
[30:56] everybody it took two meetings and he
[30:58] cut that out I didn't ask him to that's
[31:01] right I didn't even say I was against
[31:04] it but now half the workforce is upset
[31:06] at me because they said he's doing it
[31:09] because I I said
[31:12] I we appreciate that
[31:14] respect but what did he see he saw
[31:17] something different yeah he said in my
[31:20] office and one of the other guy sat in
[31:21] my office and made the statement there's
[31:23] something different about
[31:25] you he said I work I work I work with
[31:28] Christians all over I've got guys that
[31:29] work for me that's
[31:31] Christians but even in the rough times
[31:34] you don't let it get to you sir even
[31:37] when times get rough and your month is
[31:40] falling apart you come to work with a
[31:42] smile on your
[31:44] face you come to work with the Bible and
[31:46] put it on your desk right you come to
[31:49] work and you say a prayer before and
[31:51] you're not doing it for show because
[31:53] I've watched you from
[31:55] afar without you you know
[31:58] him and I think you know that's where
[32:00] Daniel was the king looked at Daniel and
[32:04] he knew it was real because he knew when
[32:06] nobody was looking he was still praying
[32:10] right he knew shed mhach and abedo he he
[32:13] knew that that that was just one
[32:15] instance that he got
[32:16] mad but he knew they're alive because he
[32:20] watched
[32:21] them and how many of them are watching
[32:23] us brother Brenham says we're written a
[32:26] pistol
[32:27] to this world brother BR made another
[32:29] comment and he says we are the only
[32:31] Bible that some would ever see right
[32:35] what kind of Bible are you showing
[32:37] him what kind of Bible are you showing
[32:39] the world well are you showing him a
[32:42] living God a living breathing
[32:47] God one that can
[32:50] take the world's worst sinner or the
[32:53] worst prostitute and make him a child of
[32:56] God glory
[32:57] yeah you know when God forgives he
[33:00] forgets and I ain't been able to do that
[33:04] yet but he can when he takes you and you
[33:07] come up here and you ask him to live
[33:09] through
[33:10] you he sees nothing from the past all he
[33:14] sees is your footsteps as you're walking
[33:17] forward in
[33:20] him and that's what the world wants to
[33:22] see they're not asking for another ideal
[33:26] my goodness how many denominations are
[33:28] out there I mean you can go you you know
[33:31] you you know City the size of Atlanta
[33:33] down here you know give me give me a few
[33:36] months and I can find the church that
[33:37] believes what I believe
[33:39] anywhere they don't want another ideal
[33:42] they want something real they want
[33:44] something to hold them they want
[33:46] something that when times get rough they
[33:48] got something to lean on they've got an
[33:50] anchor that they can go back and they
[33:52] can say but God you said amen you
[33:54] wouldn't put nothing on me I couldn't
[33:56] couldn't have
[33:57] you said you'd be with me even in me to
[33:59] the ends of the world you said I shall
[34:02] not perish that I
[34:04] shall win this Victory
[34:07] amen but
[34:09] first we got our desire him to do it
[34:12] brother brenon preached the message and
[34:14] listened to this week he preached the
[34:15] message on
[34:16] thirst first you got to be
[34:19] thirsty you got to really want it am you
[34:22] got to you got to desire it with
[34:24] everything in you you got to push toward
[34:26] WS that Mark with everything in you even
[34:29] before you get the Holy Ghost you got to
[34:32] try with everything in
[34:34] you and if you don't he can't live
[34:37] through you right that's right as bad as
[34:40] he wants to live through you as much as
[34:43] he's Desiring to live through you he
[34:44] can't do
[34:46] it and I looked and I thought oh God
[34:49] help us yes he said in 62 in the pre
[34:53] perseverance he says you've got the
[34:55] Living Word in you
[34:57] to have the Living God in you because
[35:01] the word here is God when it made flesh
[35:04] in you made spirit and life in you when
[35:08] it goes into your flesh your faith it
[35:11] becomes
[35:13] life then you are a living example right
[35:18] then you become a living God to the
[35:20] people then you become that God that
[35:23] that that thing that he's asking us to
[35:25] be in Revelations is a bride to come to
[35:27] a place that he can live
[35:30] through that's when you do it when you
[35:33] give everything you have up your ideals
[35:37] your thoughts your opinions your
[35:40] intellect your studies and you say you
[35:43] know what as brother Brenham said I may
[35:45] not know this Bible well but I know the
[35:48] author I may not know this message well
[35:50] but I know the author cuz the author
[35:52] wasn't William Brenham the author was
[35:54] God Amen God used that vest sort of
[35:57] blank it to us don't take nothing away
[35:59] from that man he had he had a gift he
[36:02] had a calling that he had to ordain but
[36:04] the author was God and God put it
[36:07] together and he tied it and he
[36:08] dovetailed it with every scripture that
[36:10] we have written and he Vindicated it
[36:12] time and time again and he says here I
[36:15] am living in a bride
[36:19] today here I am living in a bride
[36:22] today and I says brother brandham says
[36:25] now do you see
[36:27] where I'm trying to get you
[36:29] to I spoke with you pretty plain this
[36:32] morning don't you see the authority of
[36:35] the Living God in the Living Church or
[36:37] the
[36:38] bride the sick are healed and the dead
[36:40] are raised the cripples walk the blind
[36:42] to see the gospel Goes Forth in his
[36:45] power for the message and the messenger
[36:48] are the same the word is in the church
[36:52] in the person and God deals with each
[36:54] one of us individually you want to
[36:56] revive reval in your church start one in
[36:58] your own life right what brother Brenham
[37:00] say Revival was he said it wasn't a
[37:02] bringing in it was a Reviving what you
[37:04] already had how many of us look back and
[37:07] I think of David in the scripture and
[37:08] David said I had to go back and revive
[37:10] my St or I had to go back and encourage
[37:13] myself with the words in the Bible I
[37:15] said one time I said you what what did
[37:16] he do he went back and he thought about
[37:19] what God had did for him
[37:21] before you get down on
[37:23] yourself go to prayer to God yeah yeah
[37:27] and start bringing back speaking
[37:30] remembrance God you brought me from this
[37:34] God you took me from this God you
[37:37] brought me out of this
[37:39] situation God you born me again you you
[37:41] you you gave me in your life so that you
[37:45] could live through me right and I think
[37:48] of these things and I thank God here we
[37:50] are in this end time the world's falling
[37:54] apart Chaos on every corner
[37:57] everything's turning against the very
[37:58] word of God that we know it to
[38:01] be but if we really read and
[38:04] study we find out that God told us it'd
[38:06] be so yes and I look around and I see
[38:09] well why does people act so
[38:12] surprised why does people act so
[38:14] surprised that there's going to be
[38:16] people come against the message cuz I
[38:18] can read in Red Letters where Jesus
[38:21] says they persecuting me they persecute
[38:25] you they come against me they come
[38:28] against
[38:30] you unless you don't have that same God
[38:32] in
[38:34] you so I looked down and I I told my
[38:37] daughter the other day I says I says you
[38:39] go through trials count it a blessing
[38:41] what did job do job says I count it as
[38:44] an honor as a blessing that you'd have
[38:46] this confidence in me and I look at that
[38:49] and I think the world is longing for it
[38:54] the world is asking it to be so
[38:57] the world strives and desires to see the
[39:02] true manifestation of a living God
[39:05] amongst
[39:06] us and we're the only ones can show
[39:09] them and I look around the message and I
[39:12] see myself
[39:15] slowful I think God get me back in
[39:19] line God pull me back up to your
[39:22] prisom give me a fresh anointing of your
[39:25] Holy Ghost give me that love that I used
[39:28] to have for you give me that desire not
[39:32] not out of obligation to go to church
[39:34] but give me that
[39:36] desire that I can't wait to see what the
[39:39] minister can say to me give me that
[39:41] longing to hear from you give me give me
[39:45] that give me give me such an unction and
[39:47] such a desire that when I hear you going
[39:50] down the road it don't matter where I'm
[39:52] at it don't matter where I'm
[39:55] going I can just stop for a while and
[39:57] listen to
[39:59] you because you know if God's in it
[40:01] he'll take care of you you say well they
[40:04] they going you if I don't do this they
[40:05] going how are they going to fire you if
[40:07] God's not going to let
[40:10] them if God's in it he'll take care of
[40:13] you and maybe he don't want you working
[40:15] there oh my maybe he's got something
[40:16] else lined up for you now I'm not saying
[40:19] be slowful I'm not I'm not saying not do
[40:22] do do you do
[40:24] diligence but if God's speaking to you
[40:27] listen because he may be knocking at
[40:29] your heart wanting to live through you
[40:33] and there may be one amongst you and and
[40:35] and and I've come to find out that it's
[40:37] usually the worst one that you know in
[40:40] your work group or in your family it's
[40:43] usually the one e the black sheep I
[40:44] don't even want talk to him I don't even
[40:46] want to go near him but he's the one
[40:49] usually looking at you more than any of
[40:51] them he's the one in his heart he's
[40:54] Desiring to be like you that's right he
[40:56] don't want to live that life since when
[40:59] is it fun to get drunk every night and
[41:01] pass out and don't even know what
[41:02] happened I mean since when is that fun I
[41:06] mean for me to have fun I like to
[41:07] remember what I did
[41:10] right but yet we look at them think well
[41:12] you know God ain't going to deal with
[41:13] him God no live that life before every
[41:17] one of them right don't ever let you
[41:19] guard down because he may be asking you
[41:24] just to live in front of him so that he
[41:26] can do something for
[41:28] him there's with a couple of Psalms in
[41:31] Psalms 42 and was a fellowship meeting
[41:34] and I don't know what time I started I
[41:36] don't want to go too far but I thought
[41:38] Psalms 421
[41:40] and2 said as the heart panth after the
[41:43] water Brooks so
[41:47] paintthe oh
[41:49] God my soul thirsteth for God and for
[41:53] the Living God Amen
[41:56] When shall I come and appear before my
[42:00] God I thought of that and brother Bram
[42:02] took that scripture when he preached the
[42:04] the message on thirst and I thought of
[42:06] that and I
[42:07] thought does my thirst still run strong
[42:11] for God look at
[42:14] myself each one of you look at yourself
[42:17] do I really have that desire do I really
[42:20] have that thirst for
[42:22] him that amongst everything going on I
[42:26] want full concentration on
[42:29] God amongst all the distraction that the
[42:31] devil is putting around
[42:33] me I want to fully obligate myself to
[42:36] him I want to fully align myself with
[42:39] him that he might do something for me
[42:43] thank you Lord then over Psalms chapter
[42:47] 63 verse 1 and two as well it said oh
[42:51] god there art my God early will I seek
[42:56] thee my soul thirsteth for
[42:59] thee and my flesh longth for thee in the
[43:03] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[43:07] to see thy power and thy Glory so as I
[43:10] to seen th and so as so as I have seen
[43:14] thee in
[43:15] thary I thought not only my soul but my
[43:18] flesh right thirst is for
[43:21] you my flesh thirst is for you and what
[43:25] verse two say it says that I want to see
[43:27] your power and Glory as I have seen it
[43:31] in the
[43:32] sanctuary I want a living God not just
[43:35] at church when I come to church but I
[43:38] want a living God every day of my life
[43:41] do I really long for that do we really
[43:44] long for that or are we just content
[43:47] with coming to church on Sunday or we
[43:50] just content with coming to church on
[43:51] Wednesday and living the way we want to
[43:53] live the rest of the way amen
[43:58] and then over in Psalms
[44:03] 84 Psalms 84 verse1 and2 as
[44:07] well it says how admire me are the
[44:10] Tabernacles of the Lord of
[44:12] host my soul longth yay even fth for the
[44:18] courts of the Lord my heart and my
[44:24] flesh crith out for the Living God right
[44:29] is that our desire right does our heart
[44:32] our soul and our
[44:34] flesh truly cry out for our living
[44:39] God because he's there if he wants us if
[44:43] you want musicians you want to come want
[44:44] to stand try to keep you much longer
[44:48] and Skip too much maybe but maybe
[44:51] something was
[44:52] saiden a living true
[44:56] God somebody that you know it don't
[45:00] matter what the world says around you it
[45:04] doesn't matter what they they might say
[45:06] this or they might say that but you just
[45:09] want to be caught up with him yeah right
[45:12] you just you know the world can look at
[45:15] you and say well you know that that you
[45:17] know that didn't make a spit of sense in
[45:19] the world to take that job over that job
[45:22] but you can say yeah but I prayed am and
[45:25] God said he'd blessed me
[45:27] here give it time God will bless you
[45:30] there yes
[45:32] amen he says why I don't know why you go
[45:34] to church there but God told me to go to
[45:37] church
[45:38] there God told me if he really wanted me
[45:41] if I really wanted to be in his will to
[45:44] listen and he'd give me
[45:46] guidance Jesus says I shall not be with
[45:49] you much longer but I'll give you my
[45:50] spirit right that'll be your comforter
[45:53] be your God
[45:54] right and I thought and I thought oh God
[45:58] so much could be said on a living
[46:01] God but does our flesh and our soul and
[46:04] our heart desire a living God amongst
[46:08] us and do we desire it to be in us or we
[46:12] just want to be a
[46:13] bystander because that bride of Christ
[46:16] she wants it to be in
[46:18] her she's not ashamed of who she is
[46:22] she's not ashamed that she believes a
[46:24] Prophet come in the 60s she's not
[46:26] ashamed of this she's not a she just
[46:29] wants God to live through
[46:32] her if you're not sure find you an altar
[46:36] right your altar is in your heart GL
[46:40] reach out and if you need rekindle touch
[46:42] back to God and be touched with his holy
[46:44] spirit thank you Lord right but first

[48:36] it believe it he's made the way we can
[48:40] give the quotes as our brother said we
[48:42] can show all the scriptures of where

[48:47] way but has it been revealed to
[48:54] you he said I'm the way the truth and
[48:57] the life so what do we have any need of

[50:10] brother was talking

[51:52] of a normal Christian
[51:54] Life
[51:57] we don't glory in them we just know
[51:59] they're
[52:01] coming we know it's going to
[52:05] be 73 years old a few more years I'll be
[52:08] an old

[52:55] to him and
[52:57] believe and he can take care of all of
[52:59] our
[53:01] problems but see the prophet of God said
[53:03] it like this one he said sight and time
[53:05] is God's worst enemy see we ask for
[53:08] something it doesn't come
[53:11] immediately that's time we ask for it
