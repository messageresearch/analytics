[9:33] god when shall i come in
[9:36] and appear before god my tears
[9:39] have been my meat day and night while
[9:41] they continually say unto me where is
[9:43] thy god
[9:44] when i remember these things i pour out
[9:46] my soul
[9:47] in me
[9:48] for i had gone with the multitude i went
[9:51] with them to the house of god with the
[9:53] voice
[9:54] of joy and praise with a multitude that
[9:57] kept
[9:58] holy day
[9:59] why why art thou cast down

[10:03] and why art thou disquiet in me
[10:05] hope thou and god for i shall yet praise
[10:08] him
[10:09] for the help of his countenance oh my
[10:11] god my soul was cast down within me
[10:13] therefore while i remember thee from the
[10:16] land of jordan and from
[10:18] the hermanites and from the hill mazar
[10:21] deep calleth unto deep at the voice of
[10:24] thy waterspouts
[10:25] all thy waves and the billows

[10:29] command his lovingkindness in the
[10:31] daytime
[10:32] in the night his song shall be with me
[10:34] in my prayer unto the god of my life i
[10:37] will say
[10:38] unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten
[10:41] me
[10:43] why go our mourning because of the
[10:45] opposition of the enemy
[10:47] as with a sword in my bones my enemies
[10:50] reproach me while they say daily unto me

[10:57] o my soul and why art thou
[10:59] disquiet in me hope thou and god for i
[11:02] will yet praise him who is the help of
[11:04] my countenance and my god
[11:07] amen may be seated even blessed
[11:11] reading of the
[11:12] word speak on a
[11:16] little simple fault
[11:19] we'll speak a little
[11:21] i'll speak a little bit about
[11:23] the first
[11:25] and what is your thirst
[11:30] and
[11:32] you know brother brown said that
[11:34] we all have we all have a thirst
[11:37] we all came here with a thirst
[11:41] and you know the last time we were
[11:43] speaking we spoke
[11:45] on on the essence of god and speaking of
[11:47] the attributes of god
[11:49] and
[11:51] you know under understanding
[11:53] that
[11:54] in hebrews
[11:56] in a scripture where it was speaking of
[11:59] when it spoke of the expressed image of
[12:01] god we know that was the
[12:03] the translation of that was the very
[12:05] expression
[12:07] of the essence of god or the attributes
[12:09] of god
[12:10] and you know
[12:12] we understand that
[12:14] there was
[12:15] attributes that god had and he wanted to
[12:18] display
[12:20] and we we know that
[12:21] there came a time
[12:24] and
[12:26] it as brothel has been speaking about
[12:29] you know
[12:31] he said brother brown said you know in
[12:33] the immortal realms back there he said
[12:36] that you know the sons of god came
[12:38] together all you know the morning stars
[12:40] sang together and the sons of god
[12:41] shouted for joy
[12:43] you know
[12:44] why were they doing that right
[12:46] what was what was going on he said
[12:48] because they saw the plan of salvation
[12:52] where were they where were they they
[12:53] were in eternity
[12:55] that was that was a an attribute of god
[12:58] being displayed
[13:00] and we see that you know here is here is
[13:02] this uh
[13:04] desire yeah because here they are and
[13:07] you know where where were you at
[13:10] when this took place
[13:12] right yeah
[13:13] that's right because if if because as
[13:15] brother brandon said he said if if you
[13:18] were a part of god you were always a
[13:20] part of god
[13:21] you always with god
[13:23] he said and if you weren't you never
[13:25] will be
[13:27] but where where were you at
[13:30] you know when he come when god come to
[13:31] job and he said i require you an answer
[13:35] i want you to i want you to explain to
[13:37] me
[13:38] where were you
[13:41] if you have understanding that then
[13:43] explain this
[13:45] and you know we understanding that from
[13:48] last time we were when we were speaking
[13:50] on the essence of god and understanding
[13:52] because we understand what we can see we
[13:55] see ourselves by seeing who he is
[13:57] when we see when we see in the word who
[13:59] he is and we understand that he has come
[14:02] and we are seeing
[14:04] him through the words we are seeing
[14:06] ourselves and because
[14:08] as the scripture tells us and brother
[14:11] has told us that the scriptures that
[14:13] speak of the groom speak of the bride
[14:15] amen so when we see it when we see who
[14:17] he is then we all see who we are
[14:20] and you know because i i've had a i've
[14:22] had a lot of good feedback but you know
[14:25] i've had some i've had some
[14:27] questions about things that i see it
[14:30] you know
[14:31] you have to understand because brother
[14:34] brother branham said and then and this
[14:35] is the first thing just get this in your
[14:36] mind
[14:38] he said whatever he was you know
[14:40] whatever he is that's what you are right
[14:43] he said he because when we go back and
[14:45] look he said that
[14:47] uh
[14:48] he became sin
[14:51] who knew no sin exactly
[14:54] that we might become the very
[14:55] righteousness of god right amen and
[14:58] understand brother adam said all that
[15:00] god was
[15:02] he poured into christ
[15:04] and then he said all that christ was he
[15:06] poured into the believer
[15:08] he didn't say because he you know
[15:10] because he did say he poured into the
[15:12] body amen but he also said he poured it
[15:14] into the believer that's it
[15:16] and so
[15:17] just take that and say all that god was
[15:20] he poured into christ all that christ
[15:22] was he poured into me
[15:24] and people say oh well god was god was
[15:27] infinite jesus was the infinite son of
[15:29] god but i can't be infinite oh my god
[15:33] you are because you are what he is right
[15:36] that's right amen
[15:39] because so as as he was saying when we
[15:42] look back there he was speaking to job
[15:43] about what took place back there and all
[15:45] that rejoicing he said where were you
[15:47] right
[15:48] if you can see what was going on he said
[15:51] if you were with me come on you were
[15:53] back there come on
[15:56] but but that wasn't when he was speaking
[15:59] of in in the eternity
[16:02] see
[16:04] i want you to see something
[16:06] because when you're speaking of eternity
[16:09] as brother dan was saying when you go
[16:11] that way as far as you can go you're
[16:13] going that way as far as you can go yeah
[16:16] right but if you're going one way
[16:19] you end up coming back the other way
[16:24] see people people are thinking well it
[16:26] was way back
[16:28] it was way back
[16:31] it was eternity right
[16:34] it wasn't it wasn't some past thing it
[16:36] was eternity exactly
[16:39] so when he was speaking of them
[16:41] rejoicing
[16:43] at at what took place
[16:46] it wasn't it wasn't some
[16:49] past happening right
[16:52] because you can't lock time to eternity
[16:54] exactly amen so when he said where were
[16:57] you
[17:00] when the morning started singing
[17:01] together and all the sons of god shouted
[17:03] for joy where were you
[17:05] we were in eternity amen where was
[17:08] eternity right
[17:11] amen
[17:13] amen
[17:15] see when you when you look at it it's
[17:17] not so it's not something past happening
[17:20] right it wasn't something happening that
[17:22] was in the past because one of these
[17:24] days we're coming to that come on
[17:27] right
[17:28] we're coming to the place where we're
[17:29] going to be rejoicing at our salvation
[17:32] come on glory
[17:33] we don't we don't see our salvation the
[17:35] way we ought to that's right that's
[17:37] right
[17:39] see we're still bound
[17:41] in a world right we're still bound by a
[17:44] carnal mind come on exactly
[17:47] but see what is your thirst right
[17:51] see that's what we know that's what i
[17:52] need to look for what is our first
[17:54] because every man has been given a
[17:55] thirst
[17:59] but we need to we need to think about
[18:00] that
[18:01] right
[18:04] and i can i you know because we didn't
[18:06] we weren't back there as identities
[18:08] right amen
[18:10] but see god could see what was going to
[18:12] take place
[18:15] and it's in his great infinite wisdom he
[18:17] knew what was going to happen he
[18:18] wouldn't knew what was going to be in
[18:19] front
[18:21] because it
[18:24] that's how he could predestinate
[18:26] by his foreknowledge right because he
[18:28] knew it was going to take place he would
[18:29] know what the end from the beginning
[18:31] right so when when he came
[18:34] see
[18:34] none of that nothing took god by
[18:36] surprise that's right amen
[18:38] he wasn't taken by surprise
[18:41] and i'm so glad
[18:43] glory see
[18:45] if god didn't know everything that he's
[18:47] not god right right
[18:49] because
[18:51] you know
[18:52] you can't you can't have
[18:54] um one that
[18:56] is
[18:57] uh
[18:59] going to write a
[19:00] a word right
[19:04] that's going that's going to
[19:06] and go all time eternity everything
[19:08] that's going to take place
[19:10] because if he if he didn't know all
[19:12] things and he didn't know how things
[19:13] were going to take place
[19:15] then if he wrote a word then how do you
[19:17] know it's going to be right right right
[19:19] that's right because if he it because if
[19:21] he could be wrong
[19:23] because he didn't know everything right
[19:25] yeah right then he could be wrong
[19:29] but see
[19:31] then
[19:33] if if he was trying to uh
[19:36] say well this is this is going to be it
[19:40] i'm going to write this and this is the
[19:41] way it's going to be
[19:43] yeah
[19:44] but guess what he's forcing us into
[19:46] something right
[19:48] then it's not free moral agents right
[19:50] exactly you're not you're not having the
[19:52] opportunity to to decide for yourself
[19:55] you're being forced into something right
[19:59] but we also see that in the beginning
[20:03] you know
[20:04] that we know that god had attributes
[20:07] that he wanted to display right yeah
[20:11] and and we know by the prophet's message
[20:15] that we know that
[20:17] had there been no fall
[20:20] we'd have still come
[20:21] right man all right all right all right
[20:24] we would have we didn't come in the
[20:26] manifestation whether there had been no
[20:27] fall or not yeah right
[20:29] because there was a certain amount of
[20:31] there were certain attributes that he
[20:33] wanted to display
[20:34] that would have been displayed right
[20:36] that's the reason that in ephesians when
[20:39] when
[20:40] the apostle paul was writing that's the
[20:42] reason that brothers read that scripture
[20:43] so many times did you see that you were
[20:45] chosen in him before the foundation of
[20:47] the world
[20:48] see that was because see he had a an
[20:51] attribute to be displayed
[20:53] that's reason he told the disciples
[20:55] y'all didn't choose me i chose you
[20:58] see he knew what was going to take place
[21:00] and he had a certain amount of of he had
[21:02] these certain attributes that would have
[21:04] been displayed whether it be no fall or
[21:05] not right right
[21:07] but see that wasn't all of the
[21:09] attributes to be displayed
[21:10] right
[21:13] right
[21:14] and so here he is with all the with all
[21:17] with everything that we came into being
[21:20] you know and the fall happened which
[21:22] didn't take god by surprise
[21:24] amen
[21:26] and you know what you can he could have
[21:28] you can have a god that can predestinate
[21:30] doesn't know what's going to happen from
[21:32] then from the beginning
[21:34] and
[21:36] still allow you to make your own choice
[21:38] right
[21:39] it's your choice
[21:42] see you know you're not going to
[21:44] surprise god with a choice that you make
[21:46] he knew it amen
[21:49] they give you all the time in the world
[21:50] you still make the same same choice
[21:58] we had a
[22:00] single
[22:02] we had a church we went two years ago we
[22:04] had a christmas party and they gave out
[22:06] these gifts we all had to go buy stuff
[22:07] you know everybody had to buy a gift
[22:09] rich and i wouldn't bought gifts when we
[22:12] took them to the party and everybody
[22:13] goes through and everybody gets pick a
[22:14] gift and then after you go around i
[22:17] can't remember what you call it anyway
[22:19] everybody gets to pick the gift and you
[22:20] always want to be the last person
[22:21] because after all the gifts opened up
[22:23] you can pick whatever you want
[22:26] well it's just like
[22:29] you go in you go to the store and you'll
[22:31] buy something well i bought what i liked
[22:34] richard bought what he liked you know
[22:36] what we went home with
[22:38] i went home with what i liked what i
[22:40] bought i went home with richard went
[22:42] home with while he went
[22:46] mom said we didn't have to go to the
[22:48] party we just stayed home
[22:51] well you go to the store somebody gives
[22:53] you money say buy what you want
[22:57] it's like well you ought to buy
[22:58] something that you that you would like
[23:00] because you know you figure everybody is
[23:02] going to like that too
[23:03] well everybody else let's pretty much
[23:05] buy another stuff but richard i went
[23:07] home with what we thought because we
[23:08] liked it all right
[23:12] and so you know that's so that's the way
[23:14] god was he had a plan
[23:16] and he knew what he wanted
[23:18] and he knew how to bring it about right
[23:22] so
[23:24] you know here here god is and he gave as
[23:27] the produce he gave every man a thirst
[23:30] every man thirsts for god
[23:33] just like he said
[23:35] at the day of judgment you can't say oh
[23:36] i never thirsted for god yeah yes you
[23:38] did
[23:40] right right
[23:41] but what did you do with that first
[23:44] see many people have tried to as brother
[23:46] rem said
[23:49] uh the devil would try to pervert that
[23:51] thirst sure right sure he said they try
[23:53] to get you to drink from those stagnant
[23:55] cesspools
[23:57] but you have a thirst
[23:59] everybody has a thirst
[24:03] and see it's a wonderful thing to see
[24:05] what what god was able
[24:07] to to do
[24:09] that there's there's no
[24:12] um
[24:14] no way no place to stand yeah you can't
[24:17] because
[24:18] he's he's made it so perfect
[24:20] there's there's no other way that you
[24:22] can do it
[24:23] right
[24:24] and you think here
[24:26] people
[24:27] you know we were able to come
[24:29] in a fallen condition
[24:32] and god was able to display these
[24:34] attributes
[24:36] and you see
[24:39] people that wouldn't would never
[24:41] have ever received eternal life will not
[24:43] receive eternal life
[24:45] right you see there's a there's a
[24:46] foolish virgin that comes in all these
[24:49] other ones that god was able to make
[24:52] display
[24:53] here's here's this beautiful scene that
[24:55] comes
[24:56] you know open
[24:58] because see god god's not just a god of
[25:01] justice he's a god of love glory
[25:04] and here he is able to display himself
[25:06] in such a wonderful way
[25:08] see
[25:10] god god's not trying to uh
[25:14] punish anybody right
[25:16] because see
[25:17] it's it's not going to be god rendering
[25:20] judgment on us one day right
[25:22] it's our sales amen
[25:24] see it doesn't seem because we're we're
[25:26] going to be going to be the ones that
[25:27] are going to stand stand before the
[25:29] white throne of judgment or we're going
[25:31] to have to give an account for the
[25:32] things that we've done in this life
[25:34] so because one of these days we have to
[25:36] give an answer somewhere right
[25:39] one of the two you're going to you're
[25:40] going to give an answer before god for
[25:42] for what you've done right and when you
[25:44] give an answer see it's not going to be
[25:46] god having to stand up and say you've
[25:48] done this and you've done that you're
[25:49] going to know what you've done right and
[25:51] you're going to because you're going to
[25:53] be your own a prosecuting attorney
[25:55] standing before yourself
[25:56] laying it out
[25:58] see because there's nothing hid from god
[26:01] you can't you can't you can hide it from
[26:03] everybody else
[26:04] but you can't hide from god
[26:07] there's nothing hidden from god
[26:11] but when god wants
[26:13] to make this known
[26:14] see
[26:15] god comes searching for us we didn't
[26:18] come looking for god amen
[26:20] see he's the one that put the thirst in
[26:22] you for you to thirst for him
[26:25] see we never we we'd have never thirsted
[26:27] for god we never had a desire for god
[26:29] but he came looking for us
[26:31] because he's the one that made it
[26:33] available to us
[26:35] see as brother adam said and before
[26:38] there was a fish with a fin on his back
[26:40] there had to be water for him to swim
[26:42] and so there was a there was a plan i
[26:44] already made there was a opening for us
[26:47] already made before we came and he knew
[26:50] what was going to take place so when we
[26:52] come in our in this day in the life that
[26:54] we live today he knows everything that
[26:57] was ever going to take place in our
[26:58] lives he knew every time we'd fall every
[27:01] time we'd fail every time we get upset
[27:06] but see the thing is
[27:10] the grace is there
[27:12] sure see the only time there's no grace
[27:14] is when you turn it down right
[27:16] that's right see when you go all the way
[27:18] through the scripture it wasn't god
[27:19] turning the people people away it was
[27:21] people turned god away
[27:23] right see it was you know all the way
[27:25] through the scripture you look at all
[27:26] the prophets moses and jeremiah and each
[27:29] one of them when they come it was he
[27:31] they come and brought the word to him
[27:32] and told him said you left it
[27:35] right
[27:36] jeremiah stand there telling them said
[27:38] you left the living water right right he
[27:40] said you tuned yourself out cisterns
[27:42] that can hold no water
[27:45] he said here's a fountain of living
[27:46] water an artesian whale but he said
[27:48] y'all walked away from it i did exactly
[27:51] he said he didn't he never said the
[27:52] artesian well stopped flowing no
[27:55] no
[27:56] right
[27:57] he said y'all trying to go some other
[27:59] way
[28:01] and here here you are you're thirsting
[28:03] to death right
[28:07] and he said he said y'all left
[28:10] and he keeps trying to call him back to
[28:11] come back to the water
[28:13] glory this this living water
[28:20] it's saying the same thing today the
[28:22] water has been is freely flowing come on
[28:25] gloria but it's up to us to come and
[28:27] drink god i can't don't want to force it
[28:29] on this right exactly
[28:31] see the thing is everything that we have
[28:33] need of
[28:34] as brother and told us everything in
[28:36] this in this life in this earthly
[28:38] journey
[28:39] has been given to us
[28:41] he said when you were born again he said
[28:43] everything that you had need of was
[28:44] given to you amen
[28:46] but he said there was there was one
[28:48] thing that we had to do
[28:51] he said you've got to drink right and
[28:53] you've got to push out
[28:55] see everything that you have native is
[28:57] already here
[28:59] you've received what you had needed
[29:03] the thing is is we'll have to draw from
[29:05] that right
[29:07] and it's available
[29:10] right
[29:12] brother brown was saying in the message
[29:14] thirst
[29:17] yeah somebody get me some water please
[29:23] appreciate that
[29:36] this is
[29:37] from the message starts and brother now
[29:39] many times i meet people that's prone to
[29:41] be a little nervous
[29:42] when they find out that they're
[29:45] they're trying to do something
[29:47] and everything is just blocking it off
[29:49] on both sides they say
[29:51] it might not have might not been the
[29:53] will of the lord
[29:56] say don't let the devil
[29:57] lie to you like that
[30:00] he says first thing is to find out
[30:01] whether it's the will of god or not
[30:03] right then when you want to know whether
[30:05] it's the will of god look into the bible
[30:07] there is the thing that sets you
[30:09] straight is the word of god
[30:12] then if you see that it's the word of
[30:13] god
[30:16] for you to do it
[30:18] like for instance
[30:20] seeking the baptism of the holy ghost
[30:21] many times i run into people and they
[30:24] say well i've sought for the holy ghost
[30:26] and i just couldn't receive it
[30:29] i don't believe it's for me
[30:31] every time i get down i get sick
[30:33] and i go to praying if i fast i get sick
[30:38] and if i try to stay all night stay up i
[30:40] get so sleepy
[30:42] i can't get off my feet
[30:45] remember that is the devil because god
[30:47] intends for you to have the holy ghost
[30:49] it's for whosoever will
[30:52] you know
[30:54] and when we run into people and you know
[30:56] you meet people
[30:58] and they and they have they have it that
[31:01] complex they have that same thing well
[31:03] maybe it's not for me yeah
[31:06] you know they they get into this
[31:07] situation
[31:10] and you know
[31:11] because
[31:13] you know if if it wasn't
[31:16] if it was easy
[31:19] you know why would the devil worry about
[31:20] trying to stop you from it
[31:24] i mean defender was thank you bro
[31:31] if it didn't mean anything that wouldn't
[31:33] bother you about it right but you know
[31:35] you start trying to seek god for
[31:36] something then the devil starts
[31:38] hindering sure
[31:40] especially if it's something that you
[31:42] find in the scripture right
[31:45] because
[31:46] you know you find people that say well
[31:50] you know they don't they don't know if
[31:51] they ought to go to church or not
[31:53] yeah
[31:54] well it's in the scripture
[31:56] right
[31:57] they said
[31:58] well you know you run into you run into
[32:01] problems
[32:04] well don't stop
[32:06] right
[32:08] because if it takes you
[32:11] you know an hour all day whatever
[32:14] don't stop right
[32:17] but you see people that
[32:19] it's like something happens well you
[32:21] know maybe that's not the will of the
[32:22] lord
[32:23] maybe the lord put that in your way to
[32:24] see if you actually
[32:26] had the desire to do it
[32:30] maybe the lord was testing you
[32:32] maybe it's the will of the lord to see
[32:34] if you if you really desires enough to
[32:36] go do it do you have the thirst for it
[32:42] because there is a will is it's not the
[32:43] will of the lord
[32:45] hey
[32:46] it's it's everything's about yeah ma and
[32:49] so everybody's like well you know i try
[32:51] to seek the holy ghost
[32:53] and i just can't get it
[32:58] well the prophet said that he wanted to
[33:00] give it to you more than you wanted amen
[33:02] that's right
[33:04] then how is that
[33:07] if it takes if it takes five minutes 25
[33:11] years right
[33:13] we ought to keep seeking it amen
[33:18] if we have if we have a question about
[33:20] something
[33:21] if it takes if it takes us all our life
[33:24] we got to keep seeking god for the
[33:25] answer amen
[33:26] that's right
[33:29] you know there's a there's a uh a thing
[33:32] a part where brother speaking in thirst
[33:34] speaking of the baptism of the holy
[33:36] ghost you know he said inside of a man
[33:40] the holy ghost
[33:42] when the word when a man starts
[33:44] preaching that gets off the word he said
[33:46] it'll let you know right
[33:49] exactly because it
[33:50] alarms to you there's something's wrong
[33:54] now he didn't say he'd give you the
[33:55] answer and tell you what was wrong
[33:57] he said he would let you know there was
[33:59] something wrong
[34:02] because you know i've had i've had
[34:04] people preach things and
[34:06] i didn't understand what they were
[34:07] saying
[34:08] but it just there was something in me
[34:10] that was like i didn't understand that
[34:13] there's just like something you just
[34:14] can't get a hold of that it's just like
[34:16] i don't know what's wrong
[34:19] and it took it took years
[34:22] but i finally understand what that was
[34:25] that that god will show you yeah
[34:27] that god would give you an answer
[34:30] he didn't say all right he'd
[34:32] automatically give you an answer
[34:35] just like brother madam said that in
[34:37] every born-again believer there is a
[34:39] measure of deserving of spirit right
[34:42] you have that discernment
[34:44] and so every person because see
[34:48] he said it would deceive in the last
[34:50] days he said it would deceive the very
[34:52] elect if it was possible right
[34:56] he didn't say that you would never get
[34:57] me stopped
[34:59] he never did he never said you never
[35:01] make mistakes
[35:04] but you know what but he would make a
[35:05] way for you to get out right
[35:08] man because you know what you'll never
[35:09] be in that place
[35:12] because if you get if you're wrapped up
[35:13] into something
[35:15] in some doctrine
[35:17] and you stay in it for years and years
[35:19] and years and years and years
[35:22] if the holy ghost
[35:24] is leaving you
[35:26] then why are you still in it right
[35:31] because if he's not going to allow you
[35:33] to stay there
[35:35] then
[35:36] either
[35:37] you're not following him
[35:40] or what's leading you ain't right
[35:45] because if
[35:47] and how and how is it that you have
[35:49] people that can that can sit and listen
[35:52] to the word
[35:54] and say oh this is the greatest thing
[35:55] i've ever heard
[35:56] and can talk about what the lord opening
[35:59] their eyes into the word
[36:01] that they can see things and all of a
[36:02] sudden they can turn around and walk
[36:04] away from it
[36:05] wrong
[36:06] brother amen
[36:08] he said the lord the lord led me here
[36:10] yeah the lord led me here and i can see
[36:13] all these great things and and the lord
[36:15] has opened the word to me and all these
[36:17] and then they can turn around and leave
[36:22] what is that
[36:28] somebody's had a change of
[36:31] desire
[36:33] see somebody's had to turn away from god
[36:35] see they're going after they've got a
[36:37] different thirst
[36:39] see they're they're turning away that's
[36:40] not god
[36:46] because if god can bring you to the word
[36:48] then
[36:48] he's not going to take you away from the
[36:50] word
[36:51] amen and you see these people that they
[36:53] they come under the under the headship
[36:55] of the word and they start walking in
[36:57] the word and all of a sudden they get to
[36:58] a place that they don't go any further
[37:00] they get wrapped up in something and
[37:01] they're gone
[37:03] you know what the fruits
[37:05] by their fruits you'll know
[37:08] i i've yet to find a person that's ever
[37:10] went through something like that that
[37:11] you don't see it it comes in a
[37:13] manifestation in their life
[37:17] and that that goes for all of us
[37:21] it it's it it becomes manifest in our
[37:23] lives
[37:25] see it's not something you can't you
[37:27] can't get away from it
[37:30] and it doesn't matter if it's if it's if
[37:32] it's me or whoever it is
[37:36] because when these things happen it's
[37:38] it's going to be made manifest right
[37:42] see that's the reason that when things
[37:43] happen in your life it's it's time to
[37:45] get it under the blood
[37:47] that's right it's time it's time to
[37:51] make sure that we're right
[37:53] amen you know you don't have we don't
[37:55] have
[37:56] a promise of any other time
[37:59] but today
[38:01] right
[38:02] now you don't you don't have a promise
[38:06] and you look at you look at the what
[38:07] shape of the world is in today
[38:10] i'm glad i'm glad that time is it's not
[38:13] right
[38:16] amen
[38:18] see we didn't i mean
[38:20] how many people here would have believed
[38:22] in their human mind things could get
[38:24] this bad
[38:28] you know some of you have lived a lot
[38:29] longer than i have
[38:32] probably twice as long as i have
[38:35] but how many how many would believe that
[38:36] the world would be in the condition that
[38:38] it's in today
[38:40] how many would have believed that this
[38:41] is the way it was when when the prophet
[38:43] stood here and told us how it would be
[38:45] oh yeah
[38:47] when we knew what was going to take
[38:48] place
[38:50] when we we have been warned
[38:52] right
[38:54] see it's it's a great thing to be
[38:55] standing here and know what's going to
[38:57] take place right
[39:00] right
[39:00] because as the script as the song says
[39:02] on christ the solid rock i stand all
[39:05] other ground is sinking sin right see
[39:07] there's no other place to stand but on
[39:09] the word that's right
[39:13] see we need to see who we are we need to
[39:15] see what our thirst is what is what are
[39:18] you desiring
[39:19] what do you want in this life
[39:21] right because
[39:23] jesus said he said if you if you love
[39:25] the world or the things of the law of
[39:27] the world he said the love of god's not
[39:29] in you
[39:30] he said because there's a because the
[39:32] only thing that that is is the is the
[39:34] word right and you and you can't have
[39:36] you can't have the things of the world
[39:38] and have and have the word too you can't
[39:40] have the things that goes on and have
[39:43] this too
[39:45] all right see that's you can't have both
[39:48] right
[39:49] and that's the condition that many
[39:51] people have found themselves in
[39:54] we're we're
[39:55] being bound
[39:57] by the world
[39:59] we're letting the world bind us
[40:01] and what is it we've allowed the devil
[40:03] to come in and hinder us
[40:06] when we have we're more than conquerors
[40:09] right see jesus jesus didn't have
[40:12] uh
[40:14] didn't uh
[40:16] have any prop problems
[40:19] because when he came he said he walked
[40:21] in a realm of perfect faith
[40:26] jury had he had new human uh
[40:29] emotions
[40:30] he had human feelings
[40:32] he faced sickness
[40:35] he felt sorrow
[40:39] all of these things but yeah here he
[40:40] come and he walked in a realm of perfect
[40:42] faith
[40:44] and here you know because when he walked
[40:47] and he said he said the the power of the
[40:49] prince of the power of this world he
[40:51] said he had nothing in him right
[40:53] see satan couldn't get a hold of him
[40:56] glory
[40:56] because when he come to him and you know
[41:00] when he when he tempted him in the in
[41:02] the
[41:03] in the desert in the wilderness see he
[41:06] as he tried to bring the word to him
[41:10] in a
[41:12] in a messed up way
[41:14] he tried to bring the word to jesus and
[41:16] yet jesus turned around and used the
[41:17] word against him right
[41:19] here he came trying to bring the word
[41:21] and trying to get him to bow down to him
[41:24] he told him to get behind him
[41:26] showing because you know as the prophet
[41:28] said showing that the word was to be
[41:30] used by every believer
[41:33] so we have received the word
[41:35] and the word that's been given to us is
[41:37] what we use to put him behind us right
[41:40] right
[41:41] and then we can see who we are
[41:44] because if we understand who he was who
[41:47] we are
[41:48] because we are more than conquerors
[41:52] if we can understand who we are
[41:55] then we understand
[41:56] see we allow things to overcome us
[42:00] we should let we because we're to all be
[42:02] overcoming them
[42:05] we should be overcoming these things
[42:14] and i'm so glad that
[42:17] god allows us
[42:18] to know who we are
[42:20] and if we can be
[42:22] see who we are then we can see how to
[42:23] overcome
[42:26] because i i don't know who i am amen
[42:30] that's right
[42:32] because i have to know who i am
[42:36] as brother brown speaking of
[42:38] you know there's so many people as he
[42:40] was speaking of the the churches
[42:42] he said you've got one
[42:44] you know the pentecostals had such a had
[42:46] such a great move and understanding but
[42:49] he said you know
[42:50] they didn't have the word
[42:52] and he said you've got some that you
[42:54] know because they were so tall but he
[42:55] said they didn't have the spirit exactly
[42:57] he said you got one that can write a
[42:59] check but they can't cash it right
[43:01] they said you got one that's got money
[43:02] in the bank but they can't write a check
[43:04] right
[43:05] he said you have to know who you are
[43:08] because he said he said
[43:10] you know there's a bank draft of of
[43:12] heaven for you to draw on
[43:16] but the thing is you've got to know who
[43:18] you are to do that
[43:20] to be able to draw from that
[43:23] and if we can if we can draw from that
[43:25] then we can we can overcome
[43:30] and i'm so glad to see that
[43:31] who i am amen
[43:35] not that not that i see all things but
[43:36] but i know that i'm seeing more and more
[43:39] amen because i ca i believe that as the
[43:42] word has opened up we are seeing who we
[43:44] are
[43:45] i can see who i am because i want to
[43:47] know who i am right right because i i
[43:49] don't i don't want to be bound by the
[43:52] things of the world
[43:55] because you know what
[43:57] i've spent i spent too much time being
[43:59] bound by the things of the world
[44:03] i want to overcome
[44:04] i want to i want to know who i am
[44:06] because i want to overcome because i
[44:07] want i want to display
[44:10] i want to display all that god has for
[44:12] me
[44:13] because why because there is an
[44:14] attribute of god i want to be that
[44:16] the display that attribute of god i want
[44:19] to be that walking living breathing
[44:21] manifestation of jesus christ in this
[44:24] day and that's our i want to be what he
[44:26] wants me to be sorry i want to be i want
[44:28] to be under i want to be under the shed
[44:31] blood i want to be crucified right as as
[44:35] paul said to die daily i want to die
[44:37] daily
[44:39] that i can that i no longer there's
[44:41] aaron roberts living but it's jesus
[44:43] christ living in me
[44:45] because i want everybody to see jesus
[44:47] christ amen right man and see i can see
[44:50] i'm so far from that but you know what i
[44:53] still have that desire
[44:55] that's right
[44:57] i still have a long way to go but you
[44:59] know what
[45:00] if we can say but i'm i'm not as far as
[45:03] away as i used to be
[45:05] right
[45:06] right
[45:07] i'm not i'm not what i was what i ought
[45:10] to be and i'm not what i want to be but
[45:12] thank god i'm not what i used to be
[45:15] see that's that's the thing are we are
[45:16] we drawing closer to god are we reaching
[45:19] that
[45:20] fountain
[45:22] are we drawing from that are we getting
[45:24] what we need are we becoming what we
[45:26] what we want to be right
[45:28] because you know we can stand here
[45:30] looking into the mirror of the word are
[45:33] we are we drawing for what we want
[45:36] or as as
[45:37] as david was saying here
[45:40] as the heart panet after the water
[45:43] brooks
[45:44] you know brother remember speaking of
[45:45] that that deer
[45:48] you know that deer just going along
[45:51] doing his thing
[45:52] just living the life of ease
[45:57] until the
[45:58] wolf or the dog or whatever comes after
[46:01] him
[46:03] then when he comes under attack
[46:06] then he said when when he gets when he
[46:08] gets injured he said then he starts
[46:10] looking for water
[46:12] he's got to get to water see it becomes
[46:14] a desperation
[46:16] you know brother brown said that's when
[46:17] god comes on the scene when there's
[46:18] desperation
[46:20] he said you know he gets so that he gets
[46:22] to that water he said then you can't get
[46:24] him away from it
[46:25] he said you can just track him all day
[46:27] long he'll run but he comes right back
[46:29] to the water he runs but he comes right
[46:30] back he never gets away from that water
[46:32] why because as long as he's with that
[46:34] water you can't get to him
[46:37] and see
[46:39] we've got to get to that place because
[46:40] see we wonder why things happen to us
[46:42] that's what god is wanting us to do
[46:44] right we've got to get back to the water
[46:46] we've got to draw from that water we've
[46:48] got to draw that we may live
[46:51] just like that deer are we drawing from
[46:53] the water are we are we desiring that
[46:56] right or do we have some other kind of
[46:58] desire right amen
[47:01] that's that's what i want to know are we
[47:02] desiring what god has for us
[47:05] are you are you desiring what god has
[47:07] are you reaching out to that or is it
[47:09] something else holding you back
[47:14] because
[47:16] i see many things up that holds me back
[47:19] oh yeah
[47:22] yep
[47:27] see i don't you don't ever
[47:29] i don't ever need anybody
[47:32] tell me where i'm wrong
[47:47] you know just like you see you wake up
[47:49] every morning you look in the mirror
[47:51] you know who you are
[47:53] you battle the same thing every day
[47:56] i don't need i don't need anybody to
[47:58] tell me
[47:59] i know
[48:06] but i'm so glad that god don't look on
[48:08] the outside right right
[48:10] but he looks on the inside
[48:13] i'm so glad that he can see what's on
[48:15] what's down on the inside of a man no
[48:17] what's on the
[48:18] outside amen
[48:23] just like just like david out there
[48:28] you know all the brothers with samuel
[48:30] come to anoint them
[48:33] see it was though it was the one that
[48:34] they
[48:35] plum forgot about that's right
[48:38] he was a he was an afterthought
[48:42] when they brought all the other brothers
[48:44] up through there
[48:46] jesse you know and and saying it was
[48:48] like surely you gotta have another one
[48:50] all right
[48:53] and he was like oh yeah i got another
[48:54] one
[48:56] he ain't much
[49:02] but you know what people didn't think
[49:03] that that was the king of israel amen
[49:07] exactly that's what that's what god was
[49:09] looking for tonight that's right it
[49:11] wasn't it wasn't the big brother
[49:14] wonderful looking guys it was that
[49:15] little ruddy
[49:18] that god could see what was on in the
[49:19] inside what was on that
[49:21] young man's heart right
[49:23] and that was what what god desired
[49:27] so yeah i'm so thankful that we have a
[49:31] if you have a thirst
[49:32] then there's a need you know there's
[49:34] something there to meet that first that
[49:36] desire that you have
[49:39] because see
[49:41] it's so sad when you think about it
[49:42] there's a group of people out there with
[49:44] a thirst from god
[49:46] they're thirsting for god but they'll
[49:48] never come to you
[49:53] they feel it with every other thing in
[49:55] the world
[49:58] they try to satisfy it
[50:01] and they can't ever be satisfied
[50:04] right
[50:07] but i'm so thankful that i that i can
[50:09] say i found something amen
[50:19] i've said before
[50:21] if i if i died and went to hell
[50:24] i thank god for what i've seen
[50:26] exactly right
[50:28] for what god has allowed me to see what
[50:30] god has allowed me to be lord amen
[50:33] that's right amen
[50:36] because
[50:37] i have i've seen
[50:40] god move
[50:41] because
[50:43] people say that they want to see they
[50:45] want to see jesus
[50:47] come on
[50:50] i want to see god manifested in flesh
[50:53] come on amen
[50:54] i'm saying i've seen this amen i am amen
[50:57] that's right blessing if i died with the
[51:00] hail i could say i've seen
[51:02] christ manifest today amen
[51:05] that's right
[51:08] there's nothing nothing greater in this
[51:10] world than that to me that's right
[51:12] amen
[51:14] and
[51:17] his brother
[51:18] brother dale said
[51:21] you know
[51:25] this is you've received one thing that
[51:27] he said i've spent my lifetime
[51:29] trying to give away yeah
[51:34] if
[51:35] you just
[51:39] as a you know as the bible says
[51:42] you just you know
[51:46] i have not seen nor heard
[51:49] never entered into the heart of man
[51:51] what god has in store for them that's
[51:54] right you can't you can't you can't
[51:55] explain it
[51:57] the song says it's joy unspeakable and
[51:59] full of glory amen thank you lord
[52:02] amen god bless you let's all stand
[52:06] i'm gonna be short tonight
[52:20] but if you don't have but if you don't
[52:22] have
[52:24] if you have a thirst then you've not met
[52:27] the one that satisfies that thirst
[52:31] that's reason we're here
[52:36] to show you
[52:37] that there is a if you have a desire
[52:40] there's one to meet that desire
[52:44] because many people will spend time out
[52:45] in the world
[52:47] they'll
[52:49] go out and
[52:50] they'll spend money
[52:54] and it's
[52:58] women
[53:00] men
[53:01] money
[53:02] cars drugs
[53:04] alcohol
[53:06] all those things
[53:08] and in the end
[53:10] they're they're more empty than they
[53:11] were when they started
[53:15] and you know it's
[53:18] the old song said the lows are always
[53:20] lower than the hives
[53:23] why because you keep trying to get
[53:25] trying to get
[53:27] trying to get raised up you're trying to
[53:29] you're right you're looking for
[53:30] something to feel that desire
[53:32] and then the end you're lower than you
[53:33] were when you started right
[53:36] and you get you know people all the time
[53:38] trying to reach that high
[53:40] you know drug addicts they're out trying
[53:42] to find that high
[53:43] they go out and they spend
[53:45] and spending and they keep trying to put
[53:46] more and more and more and more and all
[53:48] of a sudden they get to the point see it
[53:50] ends up killing them
[53:51] why because they can't reach that that
[53:53] point that they had one time
[53:57] but i tell you what there is one
[54:00] that you can that you can reach a high
[54:02] with that's right
[54:04] and the next high is higher than that
[54:06] right
[54:08] and guess what it's life
[54:10] and it's more life and it's abundant
[54:12] life glory
[54:15] and it keeps getting you keep going
[54:16] higher and higher and higher
[54:21] you know i've
[54:22] i've had i've had
[54:24] the lord deal with me on things
[54:26] i've been i've been in his presence
[54:31] and i think
[54:32] it can't get any greater than this right
[54:36] and i thought well if it got any greater
[54:38] we'd have to go into rapture yeah
[54:40] and you know what the next time
[54:42] is greater and you think
[54:44] if it got any greater i'd go into
[54:46] rapture something's gonna happen and the
[54:48] next time it happens again
[54:51] and you're like surely we're going to go
[54:52] in the rapture
[54:55] well you know what one of these days we
[54:57] actually all right
[55:00] one of these days we will
[55:02] we're going to see who we are
[55:05] and when we do
[55:08] because i believe we're seeing who we
[55:10] are
[55:11] but there's a place we've got to get to
[55:13] and we get to that place right
[55:16] we're going we're going to walk out of
[55:17] this world
[55:18] yeah i believe it
[55:21] because you know what god has called to
[55:23] us to that right
[55:26] because he didn't call anybody else
[55:29] he called us glory
[55:32] there's nobody else in this world that's
[55:34] been called to a body change but us
[55:36] right right
[55:39] and i thank god for that all right
