we could talk about you and talk to you and know that you'll come back and speak unto us by the revelation of your word father we know the prophet said we need Revelation more than anything because without Revelation we're nothing anyway Lord we ask you to just speak to us tonight and give us understanding ears that we may hear and be blessed of you Lord and guide us and keep us now forgive our sins bless the sick among us you promised it and Lord we just believe it so have your way now with each and every one of us and guide us now in jesus' name remember Sister Trudy Lord that all of be well there in the test and remember Sister Freda Lord having a real bad headache today we pray that you'd touch each one of them we just guide us now in Jesus name amen Matthew 19 3-9 then we'll go to John 8:36 the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twine shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put a under they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he sath unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery all right then we'll go over and get one scripture because this where we want to try to tie in tonight with the the grace that we were speaking on Sunday if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to be free indeed means there's no limitation to it now that's a wonderful scripture but I believe it would have to be here in the end time would be the only people that can fulfill that scripture and stand in that place right Amen to where that the sun can set us free and the Sun is the re revealed word right it's not just an idea or a thought or whatever it's the revealed word all right being the revealed word then it is the word is the promise in God's word and that's what we were talking about Sunday that brother brandham said he had the scriptures on marriage and divorce but he said that he would bust every Church in the in the whole world if he preached it and he said what can I do and the Lord told him to go up in the mountain there and he spoke to him and told him to come back and and speak it but he couldn't say that just because that he even saw Moses giving a grace to the children of Israel or saw Paul giving a Grace to those people in his day because if you're doing it like that see you're only taking the um face value whatever you would call it are the fact of reading the word and you say well now that word is speaking so I'm going to believe it's speaking to me well that's good we should do that with the Bible right but still just the letter of the word see the letter will kill you right amen because the same one that would tell you about the the point of Moses and doing it these men that uh had the greatest knowledge of what Moses had said were the very ones that was you know trying to tear down what he had said I guess or or whatever use it as a a tempting F factor to you know to uh tempt the Lord but now we got into a point our Sunday that I want to emphasize over again a little bit you see they had to believe in the days of Moses that that Grace was given unto them now I've always believed it this way and I always preached it this way I don't believe every person Old Testament you know back there if something was wrong you took a lamb you took a d turtle dove pigeon whatever you carried it up to the high priest and he offered it for you but see I don't believe now I've just always been this way I don't believe that everybody that carried that lamb up there or the dove up there whatever was forgiven you said well it was what God Said to do yeah but you got to have faith in God that's what we were trying to talk a little bit in the the uh Bible study the other night about you know that you can just make a totem pole out of something you could take the Bible and do it just like a uh you know cuz every Idol remember I was trying to explain every Idol that there is has some form of a high priest or whatever you want to call it a person who who explains the God you know that you're trying to worship whether it be totem pole or it be a a an animal or whatever and someone tells you about that you know and tells you what that means and how to do it all right well see then you can say well well we've been told about Jesus Christ well that's good but now is it a personal revelation within your heart if not you're only quoting what somebody else says you're only saying what somebody else has said about it and see then we covered then that in the message there that the message of Grace you know marriage and divorce is not for everybody right the prophet said those who followed this message amen all right now How Could An unregenerated person a person is not born again how could they receive the grace of marriage and divorce when they haven't even received the grace of the new birth right amen see we'd be just like the Old Testament people to just take a lamb up say here all for that I'm going back and live like I want to you know well see God said said I'm tired their their offerings had become according to the scriptures a stink in the the nostrils of God where it was ordained and made a sweet smelling savior well right now to one person what's he meaning the when he would say it would become a stink but they still going on doing it see I I believe that was to those who were not sincere their offering was a stinct going up before God but to those that were sincere and right their offering was a sweet smelling savior before the Lord all right so I don't believe everybody back there that said that they believed in Jehovah was as we call it in the Old Testament saved of the Old Testament form because God said said I'm tired of all this but said an honest and a contrite heart right is what I'm looking for someone to be sincere and honest and do see then if you went up there and the prophet actually you heard him say you know go home as you are are well if you wasn't sincere would that be a a Grace from God or letters from A man right see well I believe what the prophet says and I went over and over at our Sunday trying to emphasize one thing how can you take the doctrines that are among the message you know of the people and even now saying brother Brandon was wrong and even saying Jesus was wrong and and all kind of things now how can you how can you claim a Grace but it's like I told you that they everybody wants that especially somebody that's in was in bad shape you know had a problem they definitely want to believe that you know oh yeah I believe brother brandom that that that when he preached on marriage and divorce I believe that cuz that was for me he said I don't believe the rest of the message now where would you be you said well brother Dale you didn't really get down to a lot of Grace there Sunday afternoon you but I got down trying to tell you the truth amen see if you're not born again the Bible doesn't even speak about you other than you're going to be destroyed right right it doesn't you know you can't claim anything see then if we believe that we're born again that would be the basis right of all things in Christian real you know would be based upon whether or not we were born again to start with cuz no man can call Jesus the Christ what except it be by the Holy Ghost a personal experience of the Holy Ghost if we don't have the new birth then there's no need to even talking about the things that the prophet spoke unto us and that's why you see the people they want to go out and give it to the world World they want to tell everybody about you can't do that with this message it's for his followers only he said those he said who believe this message I'm as honest as I can be now I'm not throwing off on nobody I wasn't dire but I'm just saying it I believe a lot of people went home just as bound and messed up as they was when they got there amen because they didn't do it by the correct order of of understanding see the whole point that I made Sunday is if there is a Grace Grace can only be brought by a prophet amen you so the Lord Jesus brought Grace he was the prophet thank you he was the prophet Grace then has to be revealed amen and if it's not revealed what did we give it paragraph 272 marriage and divorce brother Brandon said marriage and divorce had to be revealed if not it doesn't have anything to do with you right he promised it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it well has it been revealed or is it just a fact that you needed something and you was glad when you come into the message that you found a book or a message that a man preached that would explain these things how can we qualify that's why I put so much time in in emphasizing the fact of you know marriages and divorces and things like that because the prophet said he had the scriptures well if you'd have followed what I was doing and really had thought about it I was taking the scriptures and laying them in order now if you can argue those scriptures I brought I want to see it because I was bringing the scriptures and the prophet's message to bring it down to where you and I could read it and see hey there is an opportunity for you and I you didn't get the New Birth by just well I just fell in the message you know I just I just come along in the message no I like the way sister Gail said it she said I come in kicking see those that come in so real quick and things I call it burning like a candle where you at a candle you burning on both ends you know you're going to burn out pretty quick because you're going to meet in the middle as you're gone but if you come in struggling and searching and praying and crying then God can speak to you I'm just still oldfashioned enough to believe in a god-filled holy ghost salvation amen and we have to preach it for everybody right because we we want it that away but it's not for everybody correct amen now why is it that God don't give the Holy Ghost to a lot of people they'll say I've done all he told me to do I've repented I've been water baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a lot of people thinks if you get people baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that automatically puts them in in the message that doesn't do it that just puts them at a place to where they can get started right that's right but you see then have we accepted the grace of God for salvation in the new birth have we asked God to forgive us of our sins or we just come into the message well my pastor says if if I come in the message I got the Holy Ghost I sure hope he's right and I hope you're right but I don't believe it that way amen I like what Paul said hey you received the Holy Ghost since you believe after being in the message about 40 years have you received the new birth right what do you mean I've been I've always followed the message amen so was they good men back there like Nicodemus gamea could you argue the point that they were great men right sincere men who actually he stood up for the Lord Jesus amen see how we been born again cuz you you can't start the bases of thinking about Grace of marriage and divorce until you're born again Christian right because it's not far everybody and then being that way is it just laying the Lamb on the alter you know well got to go back again this year you know got to take another lamb up there I'll go get me under gut another one so they just made it handy for him right you remember the ones Jesus drove out of the temple they just made it handy for them they could just go by them it wasn't no sincerity in the worship or nothing they had nothing into doing of the raising of the animal or the the keeping of the animal or or checking it out and they just go up and buy one go offer it I'm honest now I'm just I've always tried to just be straight with you I don't believe everybody does that is right I don't believe everybody that says they believe this message is Right amen I don't believe everybody says they're born again is right you know what oh that's that question Years Ago by a brother said what do you think about people I said I believe a lot of people don't have the Holy Ghost cuz how can the Holy Ghost be so confused right amen come on how can the Holy Ghost be so confused with so many doctrines of the message but you can go find you a way to heaven you know what I mean you can find you somebody that'll tell you you are right whether are they buil on trying to save your soul or want your money stop your money and you'll find out where's at right just stop the money and you'll find it out like I remember one man fell backslid and stayed gone for a good many years and come back and he told him he said you can't come back in Fellowship of the church you pay all your back tithe that ain't no joke huh that's right I wouldn't tell you that it was I mean it was the person interested in that person's soul or interested in the money how many of you would be interested enough in see a man backslide say brother collie just backslid and stay gone for five years and and he owes a few thousand dollar in tithe you know how many of you be interested in shipping in money to pay his tithe for to see show what your your salvation or even pay it for it how many would do that CU you know the way I am on money so you don't have to worry about it so anybody out there on internet you you think well brother Dale there money man now I believe in tithe paying is an honor that's right amen number one is an honor it finally comes down to be a duty it doesn't start as a duty it starts as an honor an honor to give it amen and God saying thank you then it winds up as we see it as a duty of Our Lives to where that we follow the word amen would you see see what I'm talking about church could we be worshiping idols and calling him Jesus no now brother no no no why Ain you getting upset about it you know you see church we can talk about Grace but now Grace is not disgrace amen we can quote all we want to about it being unmar favor that's what it is amen it's like I've always tried my best to tell you we don't have anything to do with getting saved other than accepting it but after we're saved we got a duty to live right we got a life to live and if we don't live that life then it proves we wouldn't saved to start with why is it that everybody that says Lord Lord don't get saved come on are we playing with a Dodo granddaddy God that doesn't know what's going on you mean he doesn't know that you're going to fall somewhere down the road and prove you're not born again but he is just to gracious God until he'd be like he was with Judas loving him and everything right down to the end right but knowing what he would do all the time see we're not pulling anything over on God this is this is not a point of trying to deceive him and if we're not born again we can't even talk about the message of any form Butz I thought we believe what the prophet said that you can't be saved without a revelation right you remember that I got them laying right here be glad to read them he said you can't be saved without a revelation he said we're on the same basis am that Abel was on and he said Abel got a revelation that it was the blood nobody didn't explain it to him he got a revelation see after we get it explained to us is it a revelation or a head knowledge Paul's greatest fear was that people would take paraphrase and bring it down that as brother brownon would explain Paul greatest fear was people would take what he said and just lay on to that and not go on with God that's my fear if you to come here and say well we've got the word at Lula but is that word revealed I've seen people here that they go out to other places and tell them where they go to church at and I wish they wouldn't you know what that's right cuz you go out there living like the devil and they see you living like the devil and dressing like all of those things and acting like all those things and then claim you go to church at Lula what do they think Lula is made of right amen but you see Church we've got to have that's what I wanted to get you there Sunday to see we've got to have that new birth first come on now it's listen to what I'm saying my carnal ways of doing it it's not believing God sent a prophet that's a secondary form brother Dell boy the main thing is whether you born born again or not that's it if you're not born again it don't do no good to believe it don't do no good to be a child of the Prophet amen right where does it save anybody being a child of the Prophet that's right you see church what do we put our hopes on but then I tried my best to emphasize if we didn't believe that God sent a prophet there is no Grace amen amen so it's totally dependent upon whether or not we can believe God sent that Prophet but the new birth is the main thing amen cuz you can't believe God sent a prophet unless you got the new birth or you can believe it in the head so does the devil believe that God sent a prophet does that save him he knows it a lot better than we do because he stood there and faced him all the time am but do we have the new birth but we say well you know well brother Dale I believe what do you believe as brother WBY used to say if they get you in with a hot dog and get you out with a hamburger you see the people of the message jumping from one doctorine to another when do we go to come down to the bases of doing this brother R said they looked those people in the eye and said you're not saying what Paul said that's right come on church if God sent a prophet then that means that Prophet was God's mouthpiece now look what I'm saying the Holy Ghost is number one whether or not you're born again but that same holy ghost that comes in you by the new birth was the same holy ghost that sent a man as a prophet amen you believe it the same God that comes into you and I and burst us is the same God that promised before the foundation of the world Amen he stand as a lamb slain he promised in Malachi 4 that they would be a prophet sent in the end time but instead of trying to dig into the things that he taught in the nuggets and polish them and and have a wonderful time about what he said over and over they're trying to prove him wrong now if I'm going to say he was wrong I'm going to be like I won't call his name but there was a brother he preached here years ago and he took a statement that brother R said brother R said if you can show me one time where I was wrong he said then don't believe that's a paraphrase quote but it's close enough he said show me one time it was wrong now he wasn't talking about 700 7,000 maray and MAA or this or that or the other or white horse rider before the seals and all he was talking about silly stuff right he said if a prophet tells you something and it don't come to Pi or not real then don't believe him you know what that brother done he's that's what he said he preached probably about his first sermon right here he just quit went back to organize religion well the only thing I say about it is if I'd have been him I wouldn't have went back to organized religion I wouldn't Degrace them that much you say Degrace them yeah cuz at least they're claiming you see me blackside you going to see this boy gone he ain't going to go back to another church somewhere else or do something no why because if I'm backl I don't have no right to go anywhere I wouldn't even make a good Catholic yeah but you can go in and do your penances and do all your things and they say does that make God accept me come on church we talk about Grace but what is Grace we say grace is unmerited favor but does Grace give you a right to live as the devil lives I thought we believed that when the Holy Ghost came into us that it was like Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me now he wasn't talking about God had to wake him up every morning and get him to eat or to take a bath or to brush his teeth or whatever he was talking about the life that he lived he was talking about we're supposed to be dead we're going into invisible Union with it just I was going into it tonight and I when this kept coming I said okay I'll preach on it I can't I can't bring nothing but what he gives me we'll be in the invisible Union but you'll find in The Invisible Union when we get there that brother Brandon said a woman could be justified but said she can't be forgiven or forgiven but can't be justified let me put it in the correct order the way he bring that's right can't be justified why because he's guilty now we'll get into emphasizing a lot on this with it you know your whole husband's supposed to be dead right amen I mean we claimed a new birth the old husband is supposed to be dead right well what about us being dead you know are we supposed to be alive and and their old husband's dead I thought the new birth meant the killing of all of us you know the whole thing is supposed to die amen and I thought Paul was constantly talking about dying I thought that was brother R's message about dying to ourselves amen yeah we believe the grace of marriage is divorce what you do you say you believe in the grace of marriage and divorce yes brother brandom said it amen what do you base your new birth on come on what do you base your new birth on I know this Ain popular with people but I don't base my new birth on whether God sent a prophet or not my new birth is based on whether Jesus Christ came or not right amen then we know if he came then we know he sent a prophet amen amen it's like brother dick said that time about it they come out now and said brother brandham had 40 wives maybe he might have used a less number than that but he said that wouldn't make me no problem with me because he led me to the Lord he brought me to God you can prove disprove him on everything you want to but I'm going right down the road with he brought me to God Amen you're going to talk to God you're going to answer to God what you believe about it I'm going to answer to God for what I believe about it see then if a new birth is a revelation come on do we believe that or was it just a Doctrine or an idea a concept that we get is the new birth of revelation of Jesus Christ personally the prophet said revealed in you and it could be revealed from Christ of mystery to the most illiterate person amen thank you Lord now how can you explain it then if it can be revealed to the most illiterate person see what are we putting it on well I'm in the message I come out of the denominations brother that's what I said when I left I said I got out of the denomination now I want their denomination out of me and people just looked at me and like more what's the problem you know well I was trying to tell them what I was I wanted the denomination out of me cuz I didn't claim the new birth just because I came in the message I was two years in this message seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost before I received it and come out of a Baptist Church as a deacon at 23 years of age so you know I must have been honored for the life I was living and the the things I was doing and what I believed and cuz see I believed in living it back then told you about that old Deacon standing out there looking at some people getting off a bus one day he was old enough to be my daddy matter of fact he was my brother-in-law's Daddy and I told him I said that ain't right he said the Bible says look on God's Heritage I said the Bible don't say lust after it you see I didn't change a lot of things when I came in the message they was already in line we were already SC what what is the word fart we wouldn't let our kids watch certain programs on TV we were already doing that before we left the Baptist Church but you see church we put it then on the basis that that's my whole thing is if the people of this message are are are related are connecting to that God sent a prophet right and all these doctrines that are going every which way in the world to the polygamy to to everything in the world they all say that God sent a prophet right everybody says God sent a prophet well you know I sitting getting my haircut today she's a real good girl we've known her all of her life and everything and she said I said something about the end of the world you know and she said what do you think we're living in we talking a little bit and I told her about lady OA and what it meant you know and the way that things are and I said I'm just Wan the Lord to hurry up and come she said oh won't it be wonderful said I'm just longing for it every day well you know what he said oh no she wasn't because the way she looked you can look to the teeth is it not in the message the prophet said you can have paraphrasing putting together that you can have a long dress Dragon the ground and you hire dragon out your tracks in the back and that still don't mean you're saved is that what he said but you say we believe in the grace of marriage and divorce if we can't believe in the grace of salvation for our souls why talk about this body right that's why we've been here 40 something years after the prophet was gone let reading there this morning morning where brother Brandon was explaining I believe it's invisible Union we were talking about how that the people would have to be calling out for a deliverer he said it happened in every age out way he said the people begin to call out for a deliver and he said God sent a deliverer unto us what do we want to be delivered am are we calling out for it are we crying hang out for a a Deliverance in the end time no I'm in the message I believe it I'm just waiting on the bus to pull up well I hope you're right I just hope you're right because my way of seeing that always has been one thing right if we don't know which bus what does it matter if it pulls up that's all I've ever said well I'm looking for this to happen that all right praise the Lord right but if we're not in what's already been brought what good will that do right you see I I thought that the new birth as I quoted there a minut ago this is a revelation and and you can't be saved without a revelation I talk to prophet and what every other message that he talks about how that the the church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ is it just about every other message that he sometime or other mentions about how the the Catholics believe believe that it's built on Peter and the Protestants believe it's built on Jesus and he said I hate to be different but I believe it's on the revelation of Jesus Christ amen you know that he says it like this he said every age gets an opportunity at a revelation of Jesus Christ that's why it's the Holy Ghost in every age see then they come along and tell you the Holy Ghost ain't been down through there well where's it been but it's the Holy Ghost in every age it's in the church age book one whole message there about the Holy Ghost in every age you see if it was the Holy Ghost in every age it would be the new birth in every age and every age would get a revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ and I thought according to Revelation 3:14 which is the Lady of sin age that you and I say we're in the last age it says there that he's the beginning of the creation of God and I thought we believe where brother random was saying it in the church a book that he said this is a special Revelation in the last days a Capstone Revelation and that it had to do with the bride of Christ then in Christ the Myer he says it like this that Jesus is the center of the Revelation right he said he's the center of the the Bible is a revelation of Jesus he's the center he said and you're the fullness of the Revelation paraphrasing it if you want it I'll be glad to read it right here that's why we're not Oneness right see Oneness believe Jesus was the life's manifestation of God I don't believe it that way I believe on the day of Pentecost come into being a manifestation of God that Jesus Christ come to live in the church down Through the Ages and manifest himself and then every age would get a revelation coming down amen and then you and I would be the ones that it would be revealed to us or the prophet would call it in the church age book a special designation of himself were in his church a special designation of himself in Church see then you can see why we would have to have a Grace of marriage and divorce you said well I don't need it wa do we get to with invisible Union and you won't Crow so much see because if you don't believe you need it it's not for you if you believe you're so good then Jesus Christ died in vain if you don't need a new birth Jesus Christ died totally in vain it's not a it's not a Doctrine or an idea when we get in it you'll find out a little bit an invisible Union I believe Grace is a person amen cuz ain't never been but one Grace amen that's a person amen be person right but you see he's revealing himself in his church amen but to do that he has to reveal himself to his church first right amen see we want to signs and the Wonders and we talk about well why God is not among us it's our fault it's not his he's made the way I know that's where I've always got in trouble about it people saying you know God's not here well you still alive right but you see when you start saying God's not here then you're putting it in the minds of the people that God's not here and they won't believe that's right let me say he's here let me be with brother ROM to say that I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying I'm saying he's here 1983 right along in there when I got over that seventh seal from that day to this I've not been looking for the coming of the Lord right I've been looking at his coming haven't been looking for his coming if they in the Old Testament could look and cry out and long for a messiah and then us with a new New Birth can't do that what is this a Doctrine or an idea or another C see they're coming up with all kind of things now that where brother Brown was wrong here wrong on his dates he's wrong on this he's wrong on that wrong I try not to be too uh what is it is it an optimistic pessimistic I never did figure out which one is with one of them looking for something other looking not looking for you know but you know what the more they come up with SH and brother R wrong that's right the more I rejoice because I know that it is hidden from them man have to be blind for to say he was wrong he sure wouldn't say it while he was alive you think them Pharisees when Jesus stood right there and he said come up here and let's see you do what I'm doing come on he said well it didn't Happ well come on the Bible's are the prophet said just come up here and stand with me nobody wouldn't get up that's right but tell fares and things you know they went around the corner I believe he's wrong they wouldn't say it in front of him well what's wrong with telling people they're wrong amen Paul told people they was wrong and he turned around and said have I become your enemy because I told you the truth you're doing your best you can to save people and then spit the medicine back through your fingers that you're trying to hold your hand over their mouth to get them to to listen and believe right brother Dale you you sure did sound like our Sunday there ain't no hope for nobody there is no hope for anybody outside of Jesus Christ none whatsoever I don't care how holy and Pi you are brother R said paraphrase close but he said I'd hate to think that I was born five minutes ago pretty sure it's in the Hebrew Book he said I hate to think that I was born 5 minutes ago and have to stand before God you know some way to try to justify something or be something he said because I born in sin shape and in iniquity spouse my mothers going a liar see the first thing we need to do is just admit we're wrong that's right that's hard to get people to do is it right but you see you try to tell people the truth and then what did they become you know I told you about trying to save that whole church that they done started pointing out who was going home with what girl at night and starting into polygamy and I dug the whole thing out it I become his enemy but you know I tried that's all I can say I tried you know what I'd do again try right I'd do it again I'd try why because we need it but see church we need the New Birth the prophet of God said the the most important thing in your life is a is the new birth right there's no need of talking about marriage and divorce until you get the new birth if you can't get it settled whether you're born again or not how what are you going to do about this flesh what if you could get it straight would it be a great something if we could get it straight we could take a gun go blow our wife's brains out where we get maded again I'm free she's dead Mr see church what good would that do but everything is based upon a revelation Upon This Rock I'll build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail if the son has set you free the word right then you're free indeed right well why do we keep condemning our if we're free the prophet of God said it like this one time he said it's first got to be the spirit of God and then it's got to be revealed and then in other words he said we'll see what it makes manifest from that see if we don't believe it it's not for us you see we're all illegitimately born what great thing can we take before God I never lied that's only thing you're Prophet could say you know can we quote him people don't like me quoting him on the side like that right you remember brother Brown said the only thing he had that he could go before God with the fact he never lied you you need that quote you remember when the little boy and he got shot in the leg and the different things and the and wouldn't that be something if we could all live perfect lives but you know that was the people that Jesus had troubles with I don't have troubles with ly I have trouble with preachers cuz the Lees will listen to you there's probably a lot out there right now that sneaked around tonight and cut on that their Pastor found out about it he'd lambasted them Sunday well all right if that's the only way we can get the word out we'll do it CU at least that way you got to change Christ in you makes you the center of the Revelation that's right you realize that he's saying we are the Fulfillment of the word right the new birth makes that Soul so wonderfully perfectly totally pure until there's no marks against it or any form Jesus said neither do I condemn thee to a woman one day go and sin no more but do we believe we're born again right do we know we were born again what can you put it on the only thing I can put my salvation on is is one thing that I've always based it on is that whatever started in me has never stopped revealing his word I thought the prophet said that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether or not the spirit and you agrees with the word now agree is one thing agrees is more than one see if what I have inside of me ever stops believing God's word or will not accept the Revelation from God's word then order to know immediately that there's something wrong with me I don't care who brought it who brought it had got nothing to do with it dumb donkeys or or roosters crowing but you see we want all of the grace of marriage and divorce we're free it's like I tried my best to tell you have for 40 something years a lot of people believe the new birth is taking care of their marital problems well then why did brother Brandon preach marriage and divorce why did he not just say your new birth taking care of it see that's why I've always tried to tell you what the prophet was what he come to bring he come to bring us the revealed word like I said a while ago he saw in the word Moses gave a Grace he saw Paul gave a Grace well I'll just take it on the basis of the word then I'll go out and say it now what would that be you want an illustration of what that would be if he' had done that there was a group of people pulled up in an upper room waiting for the Holy Ghost to come right and you remember the emphasis the prophet put on it he said they said one of them come up and said hey I think we've got it let's just take it by faith and go out he said but one of them said Peter or John or whatever it they yeah but it's not fulfilled what Jesus said you see what what I'm talking about if brother Brandon would have walked out there and said it's in the Bible it's in the Bible I say it that's exactly what would have been happening in the upper room they were saying the Bible is fulfilled we've seen the Messiah we've seen him die we've seen him raised we've been with him here and we've seen him ascended let's just take it by faith let's just walk out and believe no somebody had enough of God or whatever in them to say no we don't have it yet what about the grace of marriage and divorce what do we need it for we need it for these old bodies that we're living in right the old spirit world that we live in that is polluted by Satan and the best we can do by the new birth is to say the soul is pure and and clean but what do we get into invisible Union where the Prophet said you can be forgiven but can't be justified now what's he talking about but brother de if I'm forgiven I'm Justified well evidently it's not exactly right there something's wrong because that's the way the prophet said it but what about it do we believe God sent a prophet is our whole life and another salvation we talked about salvation through Jesus Christ New Birth but then could that Prophet that we would believe come bring anything contrary to that new birth that you already have or some did you know when he came and time because he said he met people with the Holy Ghost exactly like the book of Acts 50 years before him or something like that quote but yet you see a lot of people that have great signs and wonders and miracles and and Ministries and all kind of things but won't come in this message amen but you can't deny that God is with them right the signs and the Wonders is there well brother Dale they're just not dare to come not there for what I thought Jesus said the Holy Ghost will lead you in all things and teach you things to come that's right the prophet said he not only brought to them remembrance what he said but said he taught him furtherment on the Revelation amen do we say God sent a prophet who was it men on the radio try to get away from calling names but he said them people of brandom followers he said they're not ult yeah y'all saying it they're not ults because they don't follow the prophet you know the messenger but if you going to tell him he's wrong you know if you going to prove brother R was wrong don't tell me you're following it what I told a man in my house one day he come down he started talking about something I said why don't you get in the message or get out one he said you're not be that sarcastic I got an amen out of his wife she never did have much to do with him she said you're right brother D needs to get in or get out I said all you guys are doing is using Brother brandham as a foundation to pounce around on for you to bring your great do well that's what we doing we he swept off the foundation and we're building the building I said you can't build a building contrary to what the foundation is of course I'm an arrogant hateful old dude what's wrong with telling the truth I got hopes if I tell the truth what's what is it if you tell a lie he must hold you to that but see grace is what it wrote down Grace revealed now if the new birth is not a revelation then you can argue about all the other things but if it is a revelation and it's a revelation of what well it's the revelation of Jesus Christ it's revelation of Grace now if it's not a revelation of Grace I want you to explain one thing down to the ages when they had dethroned him off the throne and was believing in a trinity and yet God still saved him right you agree all right your you're Theory just went out the door see it was it was revealed to Luther that the just shall live by faith you know what that was what is a revelation what is your definition of a revelation well it's something that's previously unknown but then the cover comes off and it's made known that's a revelation what is what is the revelation of Paul said we're saved by what by grace through am I right now is that scripture do we need to look it up by grace through faith through Revelation so Grace is a revelation right Grace is a revelation has it been revealed to you the prophet said Christ The Mystery of God revealed had it been revealed to you this great mystery Grace is a person no brother that is this UNM merited favor that he gave to us well if it's unmerited favor like that he gave it to everybody well that's right he he just laid his hand down there body now you're going to mess up your predestination instead of going by for knowledge you're going to predetermine Grace revealed how then could it be summed up in the Bride of Jesus Christ as I preached 90s something sermons on the Book of Revelations and trying to sum that up with understanding that the Book of Revelations is the bride's Facebook or whatever those things are called that you all of you blabber on and the whole thing was revealed one person 90s something sermons to reveal one person and that was Jesus Christ but then to see where he come into the church on the day of Pentecost and then the Book of Revelation is truly the bride's book revealing the person of Jesus Christ and where he went to on the day of Pentecost sure he went up but he come right back down and he's in his bride that's right that's why in The Book of Revelations I kept emphasizing it what that you never see him without her and you never see her without him they're inseparable if you can't believe in the grace of God then what are we going to do but see he's already revealed it don't you think the prophet could read the book of Revelations and see that the bride of Christ is shown in beautiful perfect completeness with no flaws against her then truly he could say say I had the scriptures right but he was waiting on something like a personal revelation for two years I sought God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost reading constantly till I was called a two-year Theologian before I ever receive the new birth why brother all you had to do believe that's what a preacher told me when I made that statement about it he said well brother Dale all you got to do is believe you believe message don't you I I believe do well that means you're saved see that'd be the same as the prophet going out there and preaching the grace of marriage and divorce before it was a personal revelation unto him right he said I had the scriptures on it he knew and those scriptures go back to 6 4 in conduct order and Doctrine where he says if you'll catch it go on as you are the same W almost wordings that he uses when he gets to marriage and divorce when he says he told me to tell you to go on as you are and he'd already said back there don't do nothing till you hear from me he said there's been ways made before on these things read conduct order and Doctrine he knew but it had to be something personal you can't say thus sayith the Lord until it's the Lord speaking through you thus sayith the lord it's not you speaking it's the Lord speaking through you right you're saying what he says to say surely then how could he come out to say I say unto thee a revelation what is it see we must see first that by the new birth now this is the only Channel I know to go by to find out anything on the grace of marriage and divorce and I'm sorry this is just my ways all right if I can't see by the new birth that my soul is just as Eternal just as pure and just as holy as almighty God himself I said my soul if I can't see that as being totally perfectly pure how could I ever receive a Grace for the body and that's the very foundation for it amen as to whether or not we can believe God's word amen no wonder people believe then that that the new birth takes care of everything and I'll go along with you if it's what you're saying this way but if you're saying when that new birth is fully completely done I'll go along with you but if you mean it was a day you got the Holy Ghost 40 years ago or something and didn't know nothing about this message I ain't going to agree with you at all that's right amen cuz I've always taught you when we go out of here in a change of the body what can you say I am said I am born again Body Spirit and soul but I got a start in a soul to cleanse a place it's got to be thy first by the new birth it's got to be Christ in you before you can believe it so the prophet said the marriage of the grace of marriage and divorce what did he say it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it now that's paragraph 272 marriage and divorce but he said it was promised but he promised in the last days in this age that every hidden Mystery in the Bible would be revealed that's a good quote to write down and keep with you all the time and say that it must be revealed not just take the words of somebody right he said well I'll take the words of the Prophet brother Dale you can't take the words of the Prophet unless you're born again if you do you're just taking the words of a man you see he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost you agree with that you believe he had the new birth anybody would know that and agree with it right well then the only one that can understand what he's talking about is one with the new birth if not you like Einstein they said there's only one old drunk Coots up there in the every where Einstein was at was the only one could ever understand Einstein talking yeah we all believe Einstein let me show you turn on the switch I believe Einstein and he talked to a finite Universe right infinite is that the word for it infinite I get my word you get it right out there and he said you look out with unlimited eyesight you see the back of your head that's what I'm said brother BR said I would have loved to been there when he preached about that you know the amazing thing was that that Einstein's theories and thoughts and ideas you know where they come from mathematics mathematics he said in that fourth dimension you can turn a baseball inside and out and never break the cover you take one solid object and send it through the other object and never make a hole that's right there Einstein's theory what if he could have got the new birth you know that Jesus came back so fight brother ROM said till he never made a hole in the wall you ever noticed him saying that he said he came back so fast he went right through the wall think about it they were talking out our Sunday about it we're in a day of such modern inventions until some of these preachers now that you turn on your your uh screens and things or TVs or whatever you're watching them on I don't understand all that so you put it all together and they got what what is that word hologram hologram and the guy ain't even there but yet he's walking all over the place preaching one lady went so many years to church till she finally found out it was one of those Holograms preacher wasn't even there come on folks don't look at me like I'm a dummy talk to these that know about it that they can project your picture until you can actually be standing there you you just can't feel the guy that's how close it is to Eternity brother M him in the in the 40s they were already dealing with being able to decompose a human being and send him to California and put him back together they said they could decompose him and send him and just couldn't get him back together that was in the' 40s he said what are you trying to sell us like using illustration like that talking about how close mankind has got to Eternity that's right and you know that all of their things listen all of their inventions all of their mechanical isms or whatever you call it Einstein had a revelation now he didn't get that from God brother Dale I didn't say he did Brother BR said you broke into God's laboratory Satan can give you those things if he can project a h a body and put it right here beside of me that you can't tell a difference sitting out there they getting pretty close amen think on these things what we need is a revelation am a revelation of the grace of God because everything we get is by Grace by grace are you saved through faith amen no wonder it's amazing grace no would it would it drop Moody then he would run out into the streets and said do you know Grace they said Grace who he said the grace of God he saw it amen marriage and divorce is a higher order now listen we're going to get to these when we get in the invisible union he said invisible he said that Paul in the in Romans in The Invisible union he was explaining he said this is not marriage and divorce he said this is a higher order all right now let's go with that new birth that new birth you receive the grace of marriage and divorce in the end time is a higher order of Grace that's right amen because Grace is a person took all of the years for the parts to be put together each each age getting a revelation of his Supreme deity go back into church and study that how each age got a revelation of the Supreme deity but you see church we get them all amen each age you go down through those ages and look and each age coming up they get more than the other when they just keep climbing climbing climbing we get it all this is the Capstone Revelation this is a revelation of Jesus Christ revealed which is Grace but we want it for the body we need it first for the soul because if a soul is not born again there's no need to worry about the grace of marriage and divorce there no need to worry about whether you can get things straight or not do you know Grace has it been revealed to you Einstein sitting there one day and something clicked he wasn't the first one that come up with the Adams and the ideas of the Adams he he he come into all that and understand it there were a lot of people back in there before he came along that had already dealt with how to do this and how to do this and how how to do this and how to do that and what was to makeing those machineries and the things that came down he wasn't the one that came up with all of this at one time you couldn't do Einstein unless you done what's his name that come up with the light bub Edison go without Edison you wouldn't have an Einstein see all of those was a revelation of the age of the time to bring it down to where Einstein could stand our and say yes we've got this we got this we put it together here it is can't you see that's what the prophet done I thought that's what he said he done he said he didn't come to bring no certain mystery he said he would come to take all of the Mysteries that was down through time and bring them together and to speak to us that was his message there's Grace this message is Grace because see when I see the message I'm talking about a person amen I'm talking about Jesus Christ come on Brothers I'm talking about Jesus Christ any of these quotes you want I got them laying here for you want but listen church if we can't see that we've got to have the new birth first then there's no need of talking about out of these other things because that's the basis of it is to be whether or not we're born again Grace is a person the person of Jesus Christ revealed revealed Grace do you know Grace let's Stand Together Grace revealed now I will tell you this a way ahead of time way my thinking is we may be about 6 months talking about Grace because that's my thoughts we need to know about Grace more than anything in the world Amen not just a quote or an idea or a thought but to have a revelation you know that brother Brandon was talking about David when he was facing Goliath you know what he had he had a revelation he had a revelation he said I killed a buer and I killed a lion said I'm going to kill that giant he had a revelation Samson had a revelation all he had to do is reach back and get his hair long as it was there he didn't have no fear you know when you got a revelation you don't worry about it if it's a true Revelation you're not scared of anybody that's why I preach with a with a not a challenge to the world but preach with an understanding say if I'm wrong come and show me but don't come with some little sissified baby Doctrine let's sit down and talk about the word of God see don't come along tell this old boy that brother brand was was wrong here and he needed to be corrected there and this needed to be done that way and I ain't got time see grace is a revelation or turn it right around and say Revelation is Grace you realiz sister Gail for him to speak to you one day you were in your kitchen and said that but that ain't nothing but one God that's Grace amen now you tell me it wasn't that was Grace Grace is a revelation of a person that person is Jesus Christ you know without the grace of God we couldn't believe that God sent a prophet we couldn't believe in Jesus Christ being our savior CU you know what you're asked to do in Salvation you realize you're asked to believe something that you can't prove you can't prove D that you're saved there's good people in the world you can't prove you're saved that way now somebody that maybe knowed you before and then send you now you sure have a lot of convincing to it but you get what I'm talking about kindo priest was a mighty good guy Cain offered a sacrifice right by his Revelation right he had the Revelation that it was works and when Abel had a revelation it was by Faith by the blood right thank God for a revelation at least I'm getting some amens out of Jonas he helps me preach now do you understand what I'm talking about this Grace revealed it's been revealed to us the world can't the world can't receive this message blessed are the they that what hear the

burn it that night you think well that was a silly thing you just forgot it but see I got to thinking about it and I thought Lord that's not right we're not trying to hold over and typ and this and that the other I'm sorry I made that mistake but I made a worser mistake I said Lord I said don't blame the people that's there in the church for this it was my mistake there's any problems you blame me well that sounds good don't it good old holy r just fell her on it the Lord spoke to me as audibly as you would say to me anything and he said if I done that said where would there be anything I done oh I cried cuz that old self-righteous hypocrite died to think I could do anything to help he said if I let you do that I I couldn't claim it i' done it I said you're right forgive me Lord for being an ignorant person and you just put that to the point of saying that through the blood of Jesus Christ we I messed up now you make everything all right cuz see we're supposed to be serious it's not a play pry we don't drive and come to church and do all the things and dedicate our life to the Lord just for some silliness but we believe that God is real he can take care of us one more step we could be turned back to a young man and a young woman no problem one more step but until that time comes what are we going to do grip and complaint no start bragging on him something starts hurting say praise the Lord I'm Healed you know if you want the revelations I got to lay them on my day you want them got a couple right here in front of me brother R said that's where we mess up on healings and things he said we need to thank God for that healing and accept it by faith and believe but ask him to reveal to us that we're healed he said when he shows you you're healed by Revelation he said you'll challenge the world you care not what the doctors or anybody has to say because you believe I told you about the doctor when kneecaps he said he going to take them off I said you'll never take them off I still got them of course they start hurting now after about 40 years and the devil said see there I said yeah see there that's been 40 years old boy you're in bad shape but has it been revealed to you see nothing is worth anything unless it's revealed Butz it's just vain vain jangling of words it could be identically the truth we read the Bible before we found the truth that was in it didn't we we believed it was telling us the truth didn't we but then we found that our reading was what was wrong not the words on the page it what went in our ears as a hearing that God said it right thank Father dismiss everybody Lord and give us a safe journey on the way home and let your grace be on the wheels of all the vehicles Lord and let Grace be the great factor to lead all of us and give us understanding we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you just me each step I take my savior goes before me and with his loving hand he leads away and with each breath I whisper I adore thee Oh what Joy to walk with him each day each step I take I know that he will guide me to Higher Ground he ever leads me on until someday the last step will be be taken each step I take just leads me closer Home I trust in God no matter come one made for life eternal is in his
