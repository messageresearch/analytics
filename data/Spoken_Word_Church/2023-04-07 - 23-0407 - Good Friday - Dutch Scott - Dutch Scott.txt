do it we gotta we got a good Friday don't we that's right we got a good Friday you know I've heard people and I've heard people mock us Christians I mean just make fun of us really they're not really concerned but they like to put it that way but they Mock and they said I just don't understand how you can call the day that your God died good and I said oh my if you just only knew you know if you just really only understood if you could only just see that that with the with their heart what this day means to us as Christians right what this really means tonight this is the joy of the Lord right the joy of the Lord in this and just to know that my God loved me enough amen to take on flesh right and to come and to bleed and die for me and for you yeah amen that's unworthy individuals wow absolutely he is the worthy one to know that I've got a Kinston Redeemer tonight that means that means everything that means all the world to me that's for sure amen so God loves you God loves you I

Friday right so it is Good Friday it is Good Friday amen all right I tell you what let's turn our attention to the word of the Lord now and uh I'm gonna title this just simply Good Friday amen all right even though we're gonna go back a bit from Good Friday and uh 1990 years ago and then we're gonna go a little bit beyond Good Friday amen just a little bit there but still this is Good Friday so I thought that'd be the simplest title I could give it I was kind of going back and forth on different things we'll just say Good Friday that'll work so I got a lot of scripture reading here so bear with me just a bit before you hear just before we get started and then I'll let you have your seat before we do though I tell you what why don't we just go ahead and pray we'll let's always let's pray first Heavenly Father dear God we just want to thank you tonight for your your goodness Lord amen amen you are a good good God Lord Jesus we love you so much we thank you dear God for for this day Lord and everything that it means and everything that it holds to us dear God truly truly Lord it is a good Friday a good good Friday Lord to know dear God that you love us to know Lord Jesus that you made a way for us and Lord to know the just the Extreme Measures and the extreme distances that you would go Lord you come all the way from eternity Lord yes to come into be made flesh to become a kinsan redeemer because Lord you knew that we couldn't do it amen but with that great love that you loved us with dear God you made a way for us oh God how I love you now we thank you we stand here Lord this this evening we just pray dear God that you would Lord that you would just step inside this vessel dear God lord I just I give myself to you Lord I ask that you would bring the inspiration but you would open channels of inspiration Lord Jesus and that the revelation of the word Lord will flow deeply therein Dear God pray Lord Jesus that you can speak to each and every heart that's here tonight Lord encourage us dear God help us Lord Jesus amen dear God is the prophet of this hour said Lord let us know Lord the day that we're living in who we are and who you are Lord that's right our place and your plan God I just pray that you'd speak to us now Lord amen come and have the preeminence and do the Greater Works Lord we pray we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen again a little bit of a lengthy reading here tonight I'm going to read Saint Matthew chapter 27. amen and we're going to go down let's just start at verse 30 33. and then we'll we'll read down a ways from there so the scripture says here and when they were common to the place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not dream and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my Vester did they cast lots and sitting down that watched him there they sat down and watched it you know why set up over his head his accusation written this is Jesus the king of the Jews and then there were two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroy us the temple and build us to in three days save thyself if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise also the chief priest smoking and with the scribes and Elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of Israel let him come let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in God let him deliver him now as you talk about just the arrogance amen if he will he said he trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said I am the son of God the thieves also which were crucified with them cast the same in his teeth and now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli Lamas that is to say my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they had heard that said This Man Called for Elias straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him the drink and the rest said let be let us see whether Elias will come to save him Jesus when he cried again with the loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent the graves were open to many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many and now on the Centurion and them that were and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the sun god this was the son of God I think you know if they really had a revelation they would say this is the Son of God right truly this is the Son of God God bless you may be seated here tonight amen yes let's just start this off right and get some water right amen that we're trying to pump amen brother wait I did I couldn't hear that brother Wade took notice of my tile when I came in the door tonight and I said when I get you know hot or whatever I'm just taking I'm gonna throw it to you say here by the way my wife says no you can't do that so amen we'll let them fight it out or whatever but all right we're gonna we're gonna do a little time traveling this evening is that all right amen and uh as much as I have on my plate here tonight or on my laptop here tonight I should say we're going to need to do some time traveling to get done so I'm gonna hurry just as fast as I can so I'm gonna pray and preach and you pray and pull yeah yes and we'll see how we can do with this amen and what I don't get done with we'll just leave it to brother Chris and he can do a much better job at it anyway so so here we'll go with this so anyways yeah I wanna I wanna go back in time tonight and uh not forward right now we're going to go back do you know Einstein and and the physics actually have proven that it is possible to travel forward in time mathematically it is possible to travel forward in time some have even posited that that that we all do a second or one point something seconds at times have you ever gone and you just feel like something is you know you just and they say that actually possibly possibly mathematically could be the human traveling forward his Consciousness traveling forward in time now I don't understand that and I don't know that I really believe that but math is something ain't it but now they say that the traveling back in time back into the past is an impossibility that is impossible Einstein said and the the physics say mathematically speaking they say it is impossible to erase the past to go back into change the past come on well now that might be true mathematically right but through the blood of our Lord Jesus right amen amen through the blood of Jesus we didn't do it in the first place we didn't do it in the first place what sins are you talking about right right I don't remember them no more they're thrown into the sea of God's forgetfulness and they're erased they're erased they said it's impossible not with my God all things are possible with my God right praise the Lord Jesus so we can we we can through through the the the supernatural DNA that we have within ourselves and I'm not talking about physically here tonight but but spiritually speaking we have God's DNA running through our veins and and making who we are and making this child of God up and everything else and and part of that spiritual DNA DNA that we have that that spiritual deity that we have he has he has formed eyes right his formed eyes I don't think it's with without coincidence I don't think it's coincidence that the prophet to this age would come to a little girl who is blind a little girl right would come and she was blind and didn't even have eyes but through the power of God he prayed a prayer and God formed eyes in her sockets right right and in the middle of it in the middle of he stops oh I forgot to ask you what color eyes do you want right what color eyes do you want she wanted blue if I remember right right the prettiest blue eyes you ever saw damn it come on man I I I I know they must have been if God formed those eyes amen right they they had to be somewhere set of eyes amen I would like to have seen a picture of that little girl when she grew up I bet those eyes were still just beautiful blue eyes but you think of the eyes that God has given you tonight that's right not these natural eyes not these natural eyes but the but a spiritual set about evil eyes right thing about an eagle come on oh look you gotta you got a hook right there that's pretty neat oh my God I'm easily impressed where's the cup holder no cup holder Brother come on that's coming okay God has given us eagle eyes there's just something about those eagle eyes right and through those eagle eyes that we've been given we're able to we're able to to see amen we can see ahead yep but we could also see back right you know the prophet made this statement talking about Adam and Eve and he said they drew Eve and your painter is this ugly little ugly looking thing right he said oh just awful just hoard what she looked like he said but no I believe that she was the just a beautiful that's right perfect specimen of a woman right she was exactly exactly he said she was blonde-headed right he said she was the perfect specimen the most beautiful woman in in the perfect statue and everything else and you and and and God you know allowed that Prophet to look back yes sir in time well I believe we can do the same thing not that we're prophets amen not that we're prophets don't get me wrong but I believe Through The Eyes of a prophet we can do that yeah and I believe Through The Eyes of Faith tonight we can do the same thing that's right brother and that's kind of what I want to try to do tonight yeah go ahead brother it's pretty bad I ain't even got started and I'm already unbutting in here so we're not bound by time tonight amen so so looking through these Supernatural eyes and these eyes that we get from our Supernatural father we look and we can travel back in time and we go back and back and back and all the way back we'll roll that calendar back and roll that clock back and now the date that I'm going to land on of course is April the 2nd I know today's April the 7th I didn't mistake that that's all right it's April the 2nd or as the Jewish calendar would call it the second day of this Nissan I think it's called I probably didn't pronounce that right which is the first month of the year for them right and the year is 33 A.D so if you go back to Good Friday they didn't even call it good Friday at that time they didn't know what was taking place but but if you go if you were to roll the calendars back all the way back 1990 years ago a good Friday lands on April the 2nd right an 80 30. wow that's ad33 not not two zero two three right 80 33. and and then actually if you go back here yeah oh I made a miscalculation good Friday lines on lands on April 3rd I want to go to April 2nd actually I'm gonna back up this a bit more there you go if you go back to April the second here the day before this day is called if you know you you look at it and if you you follow certain things brother Brown referred to the Holy Week in a couple of different places he never said the the they never said the passion week he said the Holy Week right now I do believe it was a passionate week I believe Jesus had plenty of passion for that week right amen but if we go back now to the Thursday before the Good Friday that day is actually called by by many by some of the Monday Thursday Monday Thursday is the day which com commemorates the last supper and the foot washing that immediately followed the Last Supper there amen and Monday is from the Latin word it means uh I think the word is is not Latin I can't say that close enough yeah it means commandment brother Bob could probably pronounce that just perfectly I can't do it but it means commandment and of course the Lord left us these Commandments right brother Brandon said that we have three Earthly Commandments that the Lord left us amen water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right and then communion in football and on this day Monday Thursday there we were given two Commandments from the Lord to do this in remembrance of me right so it's Monday Thursday and so I'm going to go back I'm here now Monday Thursday and I want to be you know I'm going to be just an observer I'm going to use my eagle eyes a little bit tonight and I'm going to look at some things here and we're just an observer here for the purpose of this sermon here tonight so we're on April 2nd A.D 33 and then our observation Point we've got to have some place that we're looking at it from some point of perspective and the point of perspective that I'm taking here tonight is actually Perch Way up on top of the temple in Jerusalem so if you could kind of just fix it in your head tonight you're sitting on top of the Temple in Jerusalem on Nissan two 80 33. they didn't even know the days that they were still going you know the Jewish calendar still went by a whole different accounting system than that and but we're sitting up on top of the temple and the Temple's Dimensions here were given to us by Solomon and were given to Solomon and Solomon began to build it and he lays it out and he says it's 20 cubits wide by 60 cubits long and 30 cubits high right and and the Cubit Dimension is anywhere it's somewhere between 18 to 24 inches long now I'm not really good at math in a lot of ways don't tell the for my surveyor friends that but I'm not the best at math so I'm going to say my wife can attest to that I'm gonna I'm gonna take the 24 inch and say a good two foot so if you go two foot that means this thing is 40 foot wide right 120 feet long right and 60 feet high yes that's right now when you get up about 60 feet high you can see a long ways and a lot of the things that happened on this night April the second I'll say it easier April the 2nd 1833 a lot of the things that happened were within a relatively short distance that's right of each other really yeah and and so we've got we've got a pretty good Vantage Point sitting up on the sitting up on top of the Tabernacle and and we're we can you know you can Orient yourself that way you can look and he said okay there's the East right over here is the East right and then there's the West there's the north there's the South and we can look at these things and we can just start saying oh my look at this look at that and a lot of things have have happened here a lot of things have happened God has you know to be able to come to this time history even in time time and time to be able to get here there's a lot of things that God did to bring us to this point I mean you can you can go all the way back and the things that God had to put in place and orchestrate and make happen even you go back to Rahab the Harlot and you go and your boys and all the different things that would go through it and Ruth and Naomi and all the things that had to be orchestrated to bring it to this point when the son of David could be could come and and be here at this precise moment in time yeah right come on I mean we don't know the half of it we don't know the 90 we don't know 99.9 percent of all the things that God did to bring us even to this point right here amen but there was a lot that has led up to this time in fact everything has led up to this time all the way from the beginning when there was a lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world God had this in his mind before the foundation of the world right and we realized that in the beginning even oh let's go even but beyond that even at the beginning when God made heavens and earth yes and and as is true with his whole creation they were created to show and express the glory of God Amen I'm out right yes in fact the Old Testament Believers such as job and Enoch many of the others many many of the others they all look to the stars and creation as ways to understand God that's right yeah you know science used to do that the Natural Sciences they used to do that that's right up until about the 1700s science was used as a way to prove the things of God right and about the seven earliest middle 1700s forgive me I forget the year and the name of the the different ones that were coming forth and they began to you know atheists begin to come up and satanists began to come up and begin to use science and twists in ways to try to disprove the word of God and that brought us all the way to we where we are right now right amen amen 200 300 years now down the road and look what we've got out there now men can be women and women could be men and my all the different just the junk that's out there now right amen amen but they would look to the Stars let's focus on the stars for a moment they would look to the Stars to to understand god dude for the word because we realize the word you know the god wrote his first Bible in the Stars right brother Branham says this in in the message show us the father and it'll satisfy us he said then the first thing you know I hear him say let there be light and when he did Adam broke Yonder hey now now that's something that's very significant yeah pick a little funny you know as it were one time in a and there was a there was a man there was a scientist an atheist or I don't know if he's an atheist because he was talking to God but he's talking God said yo we you're irrelevant now we don't need you anymore come on we can do everything you can do we can even create our own man now come on he said oh you can he said yeah we can create our own man he said okay you go first right right and the scientist reaches down to get something he said oh yeah that's right that's my dirt you got to get your own you got to get your own right when you can bring an atom out of nothing when you can can you can do you can bring bring all that we see out here now out of nothing if you can even get to a place where you could explain that they can explain listen they can explain science can explain it all the way back to the Big Bang they can go all the way back and explain how everything got here by their powers of observation they've been able to do that you know what I believe they got a lot of it right but when they get there they say what happened what was before that well you know I think it just probably always was we don't know we can't see back that far that's right yeah come on Mercy so brother Brandon says again and then the first thing you know I hear him say let there be light heaven and when he did in Adam broke Yonder and the son came into existence and I watched that sun burn for millions of years I think he just sat there and watched that thing ball of light out there those eagle eyes yes I watched that certain that sunburned for millions of years and the first thing you know brother Brandon illustrates there and he said and there there goes a clinker there went a clinker and and he stood and watched it in it and it flew yeah and it fell for a million years and he stopped it yeah right yes and then another one flew and he stopped it yes what he said what he said he was putting the solar system he was running his first Bible that's right and the first Bible that was written in the skies man looked up knowing that God was above that's right they couldn't deny it when they looked up into the stars and in the heavens they saw the majesty and not just the beauty but they saw a they saw an organization up there you know we look up sometimes and if you don't know what you're looking at it's just a bunch of blinking lights up there right you know is that a star or is that a planet is that a star is that or is that one of Elon musk's satellites going across the way over there I don't know but you know for the men of old they looked and and they understood these things right they understood the the the Rhythm and the patterns and they understood the organization of it and they said that didn't just happen that's right amen praise the Lord yeah yeah somebody had to do that my goodness you look at the trees and everything else there and you know even the way A Tree Grows you can they talk they call it the thumbprint of God you can pick up a pine comb and look at a pine cone and there's a swirl in the bottom of where all the things come together right and that that that's I can never pronounce it what it's called it's a it's a come on I can't pronounce the word I'm not even going to try it but it's a certain it's there and you can take that same that same swirl and if you could raise up above the Earth like in the International Space Station you look down on a look down on a a hurricane forming a whole weather pattern it's that same swirl and if you look at a tree you go look at a tree and you might not even see the tree the swirl of the tree you just look up and you see limbs those limbs are spaced and twisted at that same swirl all the way up it's called the Golden Ratio right and it works on the same pattern all the way through you can flush your toilet yeah and that water will swirl in a certain it is you know again the shape has a little bit to do with it but that same swirl is a Whirlpool makes it it's that same pattern they call it the thumbprint of God that don't just happen they say oh that just happens that's gravity and that's this and that's everything else well then you can take it out into the Galaxy and the galaxies swirl around each other in that same swirl amen it's too organized right it's two there's something in control right there's something in control and I'm so glad I know the creator of everything that there is amen hallelujah praise the Lord let there be light and then there's light oh my man looked up at all this and he knew that God was above man looked up and it's the word of God written in the stars and he knew that God was there God was speaking from those Stars you know we have a word of God in this day too right amen and we can look to this Bible we can look to this Bible and we can say that God is in his word amen God is in his word there's something moving in that word as many times I can't see it but I know it's there I can feel it's there there's something behind the curtain and I know that there's something there and then there's times when he pulls the curtain back and I say oh praise God I see it right amen yes God in his word but even more than that for the born-again believer we can look to the Living Word living in us and say that God is right here God is right here right yeah he is not just God above us although he is he's omnipresent amen by his omniscience he's omnipresent and he's not just God With Us which we most assurely know that God's with us oh how comforting that is to know that God's with me right amen but it's not just that but it's God in us tonight that's another thing for Good Friday is God in us tonight the word of God born down in our souls and living through us tonight Flesh and Blood Jesus Christ walk in the earth once more amen hallelujah that body that lays on the on the throne of sacrifice that that body that lays on the alternate he can't he can't put his feet on this Earth amen but I tell you what he can inhabit a body a broad body down here and he can walk upon the face of this Earth amen and he does he does that's right he walks into church yeah hey he walks into houses he walks into Walmart yeah I used to preach a lot about the Walmart cashiers and that devil even took that away from me and he even took that away from him brother Branham goes on to say if the Walmart cashier was my catch-all for everything when I was when I started preaching that was that was my source of aggravation that was my source I'd be happy and even in spite of the Walmart cashier amen do all these different things like that and then he takes that away Brooke Brown goes on to say this talking about the Stars he goes on to say now look at the zodiac starts off with the Virgin ends up with Leo the Lion the first coming and second coming of Christ everything in the heavens declare him everything in the earth declares him everything around declares him his people declares him his power declares himself amen his son declared him right amen everything declares Our God Amen you just have eyes to see with right why is it good Friday my goodness is a clearing God like never before amen amen there has to be a death before there can be a resurrection praise the Lord Jesus if there had been no cross there would be no Resurrection if there had been no Resurrection I tell you what I would be among all men most miserable but God knew how to make me happy praise the Lord and God being God and knowing all these things he knows exactly where every Star is at at any moment any split moment of time he knows exactly where those stars are he knew exactly where those Stars would be sitting on the second day of Nissan ad33 when he when he first slung those slung those Clunkers out of that great light in the beginning of time he knew where those Stars would be when Jesus was walking to the Garden of Gethsemane amen yeah astrologers talk about the the big bang and they can use their math and their understanding and deduce that the universe is expanding and twisting and it's expanding and moving outward yes sir so it's it's in a spiral right they can observe this they can see this and they measure this I mean you know Einstein used to when we talk about Einstein the smartest man they ever lived is not exactly but he was real close Solomon was very smart right yeah but Einstein in his in his General the first the general relativity I can't pronounce all the names and everything else forgive me I'm just Plum dumb but when he goes out when he first puts out there he looked at the universe and he said that it was he said it was just a constant it's just constant yep and and it just that's how everything was and there's a movement there but it was a constant there but but there was another man by the name of Hubble you might have heard the Hubble satellite well Hubble was actually a an astrologer back in the 30s I believe it was and Hubble what Hubble found through his observation and looking through a telescope Einstein didn't have Hubble's telescope so as he looks through there Hubble was able to to to see that these stars and everything was moving away from him right at a certain rate and that they were expanding they were going out they were getting wider away from each other he was able to observe this in the 30s and he and he put this thing down Einstein when he tried to make his his theory of relativity I believe it was when he tried to make all that work he actually there was one number that would never work right so he fudged it yep Einstein fudged it he came up with a number that made his calculations work yep Einstein does I did that in school a couple times it didn't work so good for me come on man but Einstein did that and then he ran into Hubble and he said I got to see this for myself so he travels I believe in Hawaii if I'm not mistaken he travels all the way to Hawaii and he goes down to Hubble's telescope he looks up there and he says you know what he's an honest enough man he says you're right yeah I got to redo something yeah I got to redo something because the universe is not stagnant our God is Not stagnant right amen and he says so he goes and he puts it out there and he says he looks and he sees these numbers he reworks his numbers and they all work amen and they say the universe now they say it's expanding at a certain rate in a certain you know Direction a certain speed I think it's 163 000 miles an hour that it's moving away from us it's expanding I should say right 163 000 miles an hour booth just like this and they and they can measure that right and they said well well if we can measure it that way we can reverse our calculations and we can go back this way and we can find where it all converges at and when it all comes in converts we'll know that's the beginning yeah yeah and they've actually been able to I don't know the time but they've actually been able to age it and time it and say this is the beginning and they call that the singularity yeah wow right right and it's when everything all all the matter of the universe come on we're not even a speck of dust man we're like a we're a speck of a speck of a speck of a shadow I don't even know how to even begin to describe what we are on Earth but oh it's a matter of the whole universe yeah comes back down into a pinhead come on a smaller and the the mass of all the the all the creation the mass of that is in the space of a pinhead come on and they call it Infinity that's right because the way the mass is in in fantastic it's almost an infinitesimal that's the wrong side it's it's Infinity you can't you can't measure it right that's right thank you Lord yeah hey we're out beginning with him and God said boom and it all goes yeah and you say what in the world does this have to do with Good Friday hold on I'm getting there you're good you're getting it brother Wade gets up I'll know I I miss my getting there come on so so you you look and and all these things they come back down and they can tell us exactly where all these things are but no oh no and he said well what's on the other side of that as I said what's on the other side of that and and some will say God well then they're just ridiculed and pushed out you can't say God come on I've always I've heard others say aliens it's funny it is the most hilarious thing to me that they will go so far as they say aliens but not God all right then tell me what created aliens come on now right on they say we're living in a computer program well then tell me who created the computer program somehow another at some point another you got to get down and say there's an infinite God there is an eternal God there is a creator of all things and he cannot be denied amen yes sir praise the Lord they can tell you where that ball of infinite Mass where it all comes to but they cannot tell you what was before it amen right right but God said let there be let there be yes sir and time matter and space all came into existence at the same time the Bible says in the beginning there's time God created Heavens there's space and the Earth and there's matter and it all came into place it all came up there and God began to cry aren't you so thankful that you know the creator of God they could put all these things in order yeah I'm going a long ways to get there but all these things in order and bring it to a place to where we say God you are in control in the darkest days of my life you are in control when Jesus died upon the cross you were in control Hallelujah you never lost control not one moment right amen amen and when he was writing that first Bible across the skies he was in control amen and when he stretched out his arm to stop one there and one there and one there and one there amen he was in control he was writing his Bible in the Stars amen yeah praise the Lord he's writing his eternal word in the Stars rotting out this great word that's right amen and foretelling exactly what was going to happen and what was it all for right come on come on now I've heard others it would come other scientists in different wines and they say well they are they call them uh intelligent design that's right and under intelligent design they would say by just reason their sheer reasoning Powers they say somebody had to do this that's right the Lord but a lot of them will not say that Jesus Christ created everything right they will not speak the name of Jesus that's right they will not do that right they will not do that but but here but God looking ahead in time when the only begotten Son of God Amen the beginning of the creation of God Amen the vessel that God would create in a virgin womb and would step down into this natural creation for the greatest battle that was ever fought that God that God right there he knew exactly what he was doing come on now as spiritual scientists we can look back now tonight we can look at all these things and say God is amen God is amen you can you can yeah I found all sorts of people saying oh I believe in God right sure I can find you all kinds of denominations and everything else it's not even the dominations now yeah come on now it's all the ones that got Angels sitting on the Shelf at home but they you know some of the you listen to what they say it's like oh my goodness gracious it's an angel I believe in God [Music] I saw a Methodist it was either Luther or Methodist preacher the other day they were on there and they were talking about they were talking about transgender things yeah she was it was he was it was whatever was dressed as a woman come on the thought that God was a woman great brother I thought God was a woman yeah yeah and I thought how in the world can you do that I said well I know how you do that you you remove yourself from the Bible you you can look up and by your reasoning you can see this and just by the hunger of the heart brother Brown said Man was created to worship and man will worship something right it used to be that you know somebody didn't go to church the old man didn't go to church or whatever he'd sat there and polish his cars wouldn't he oh man and he'd worship that car I got a 65 Mustang buddy this thing is sharp I got a 70 Chevelle yeah come on I got an old ugly boxy 78 Scout International that's sitting in about a thousand different pieces and they could sit there and oh I don't got time to go to church Sunday's my day of rest and they went out there and they'll turn wrenches and they'll sweat and they'll do it they're going to worship something amen all right brother hey man come on Joe just for the past few years though the the atheists started getting together and having Church foreign they actually did they do yeah and now they've applied for a religious religious whatever in school so that they have equal opportunities and they have their you're going to have a Christian this or whatever but they've got their satanists this and that and they say the kids are joining in droves oh I'm sure there right sure they are yeah man look at all these things that take place here man can look up brother Brown said man we'll look up and see that God was up there amen and the child of God will always be able to look yes and see yeah what God's doing because he's got eyes to see with right right and he can put a name to it and God as you know or us as spiritual Christian Scientists so to speak we can look back and we can see there and God has allowed us the means to put a name to to God right and we can look back and see all the things that happen and say that's God yeah right and his name is Jesus Amen brother and his name is Jesus so here we are standing atop his Temple I've gone a long ways around there went further than I wanted to go but here we are standing on top of the temple on the on April the second AED 33 I keep want to say 1933 just don't work that way amen and we're up here in all Jerusalem is laid out around us all Jerusalem is laid out around us here and and a little we'll we'll just try to orient Orient ourselves here I'm I'm out I don't have the surveyor's magnet in my brain I can't tell you which I've had my phone I'd pull it up the compass up which way is east east come on there's East right all right so if that's East that's North I was fixing to say North but it's just for the point of the door not because I knew anything foreign West South and I'm sitting about 60 feet off the top of the ground maybe a little bit higher depending on what the outside was I don't know I'm sitting up here and and a little bit so so there's there's East North West South so so over here to the Southwest come on a little under a half a mile they say it's about 800 meters when I looked it up which is 0.49 something something or another so a little under a half a mile to the Southwest of the temple where I'm sitting or where we're sitting right there's a group of men a group of 12. coming out of a upper room wow come on yeah coming out of a little place where they're going to have supper where they'd washed each other's feet yes now if we'd been if I hadn't took so long in my talking and all the stuff around there we might have seen a man walk out a little bit earlier yes leaving in a hurry maybe he had a hood over his body of his robe pulled up over his head and you can see he's kind of darting back and forth looking around he's trying to obscure his obscure his identity maybe his his little darting eyes but he had a purpose burning in those eyes and he had a direction that he was going and he's walking briskly on purpose with purpose yeah and he's going to meet the chief priest right right to betray our Lord wow he doesn't have far to go and the deed doesn't take long that's right that's right that was earlier this is now and it's evening time and the Lord and the 11 remaining disciples are leaving the house heading off in a winding and generally Northwestern or Northeastern I think it's Northeastern actually northeasterly Direction going past the Great temple again so the temples here they're less than a half mile over there having to go through the streets of different things so they're winding their way in a generally Northeastern Direction they go past the temple where just a few days before Jesus had planted a planted his Whip and and ran the money changers out because they didn't have a have the right Heart Right amen they were they were trying to find an easy gospel you know that's what people do they try to find easy gospel I don't want the easy gospel I can say that because the Lord does not give me an easy gospel amen things are not easy things are hard people get sick I get sick we have family issues we have things that just turn us on our heads our hearts are rich from our bodies we don't have an easy gospel that's right amen my phone's sitting in there right now right before I came out I couldn't answer the text sitting there on my phone from a from a young man that said you told me if I prayed and I didn't even answer I didn't even open it all the way up because I didn't I don't want it to show red right yeah I'm fixing to go to the pulpit you told me if I prayed let me tell you what my experience with praying is a lot of times I pray and it gets worse I pray and it seemed like the exact opposite of what I prayed happens right that's right I knew you could relate to that because we're all in this we're not in in for an easy gospel that's right but we're in for the true gospel and it is good news that's right because he wins in the end he wins right amen so they're going by the temple where they're where you know again just a few days before he'd ran the money changers out you think about that the money changers in one way it looked like a good service I mean not everybody could had access perhaps they didn't have room to have their own sheep or their own turtle doves or whatever they didn't have the access to these things and and they couldn't exactly and maybe they were in a hurry they worked six days last week and the boss was really hard on them and and so you know I I don't have time to I'll just go buy one I'll get one they've got one there in the temple I can go and and there's a nice man there that raises the best the best sheep you ever saw brother Wade I mean they're the best sheep right I mean he makes sure that there's no spots on him he won't bring a bad one he only brings his best and I'll just go buy one from there come on sounds like a pretty good service to do right I'm you're helping the church out wow no bring it God wants sacrifice that's right and you God will sacrifice he wants us to sweat on our brow amen I mean when you think of the links that he went to for you right brother I should be able to do the same for him I could never do the same for him but I should give my all right amen I should give my all right so here they are and they're walking past this the Grace Temple because again this southwesterly is the it is is the place where they were having the last summer Last Summer the last supper and then the and then you come up and I'm thinking I'm hot that's what it is see and then and then there and then they go up and they've got to go they're going this way and Jesus is leading them down a northeasterly direction and he's carrying them to the Garden right yep he's carrying him to the guard now they've got just a little bit over a mile they said it's something probably somewhere around a mile and a and a quarter 1.25 miles that they probably had to walk because it wasn't really that long straight distance but they had to go through the streets and the wind and everything else to get there they had to go through Gates they had to go through it's because it's outside the city proper so they had to go through the gates and all these things and it's evening time and they're making their way out here uh-huh here I am just sitting here just watching it and I said there's my Lord there's my Lord just a few days before he's entering on the back of the cult the fall of an ass right sir they're waving their their Palm their palm branches which is a sign of victory that was the Victorious King coming right back they knew they knew who that was right because because Isaiah had said and Ezekiel would say and Zechariah had said and low he's coming your king is coming right amen lowly humble right riding on an ass the cult the fold an ass yeah they knew that and they received they received him triumphantly right and they they call that hosanna would they say hosanna to the king yeah I hit this I hit this Sunday Hosanna the word Hosanna we think of you know Hosanna Blessed Be The Rock Blessed Be The Rock right and it's worshiping and jumping and shouting everything else and it's true it is true but when you go back and you look at that word Hosanna it's not just that it actually means pleading it's a it's a compound Greek word come on and the Greek word is hosanna it's one of those words like hallelujah it's the same in all the all the languages but it's a two-part and one part is pleading yeah yeah and the other part has to do with deliverance and salvation and and Liberty amen yeah so literally what they're doing they're pleading with the Lord as he comes in they're waving you are the king you are the Victor you are the one and we're bound and we're we're in subjugation and we're all these things and we're hurting and we need to deliver and we need a king and we need this and we need that and that's what they were doing when he was coming to the city they were looking to God and you've got to look to Jesus they're looking to Jesus for what they need problem today is people don't know what they need that's right brother man let me get my phone out I'll look on Amazon ah they knew they needed Jesus yes or they they knew they needed that image that they had in their mind anyways which is another problem that people have they get an image of Jesus whether it's the cool Jesus the Church of Jesus the unchurched Jesus right they know they need a God what they need is the god of the Bible amen all right amen all right brother I could look down though I look down and I see it I said there's there's my Lord that's the one I need yeah right now that's the one I gotta have so as he's as this group of 12 they make their way through they're going through the through the city and then out the gates and eventually they make it the way to the to the Garden which is about a half a mile or maybe a little bit over from from the temple where we sit yeah so again you got almost half a mile there and a little over half a mile here you got just a little over a mile and they make it there to the to the Garden of Gethsemane The Garden of Gethsemane of course is a place of solitude yeah yeah yes sir this is a place where the Lord would would resort to at times to get a loan to go to pray and to and to refresh himself right right he'd go to get away from the things of this natural world that are so good at drowning out that still Small Voice and let me tell you something hearing that still Small Voice is so vitally important yes sir Jesus would go there to commune with his father and he had to keep this channel of communication open because remember he said I can do nothing but what my father shows me he had to keep a a Channel of communication open between him and and his father right come on the spirit yes well it's the same for you and me we have to keep that channel of inspiration that channel open where that still Small Voice can can get there and to do that we've got to be able to shut out the things of the world is so hard well the Wade said we're having dinner we'll meet at Cracker Barrel about 4 30. you told me that last night or this morning did you tell me that last night or this morning this morning yeah I worked till 10 30 last night I was I had said I told I I text the main office I said I'm done at 10 30 I said I'm done I'm out I'm gone and then the phone rang right that's right and at 10 30 last night I threw up my hands and said I quit right come on so so you know everything and that's the way it works and Satan knows that he knows that if he can get that if he can stop that communication if he can kind of make it hard to hear that still small voice Jesus said I can do nothing but what my father shows me and listen we're the sons of God and the sons of God are LED of the spirit of God and you've got to be where you can hear the spirit of God it's very important we must keep this Supernatural Lifeline open we must be led of the Lord amen amen so now as we look to the east for my perch on top of the Temple we see we see Jesus and the leaven entering into the garden and and we may be using our eagle eyes for real now here a little bit here because they're there at the time there were walls and things that were kind of in the way but but with our with the air the supernatural eyes of our heart we can see through those things right and and let's just let's just imagine or just think that we see Jesus as he's entering into the Garden or getting closer to the garden and he just seems to be carrying a heavier load than usual come on perhaps his feet are slowing the closer he gets his shoulders those precious shoulders are kind of hunching over they're beginning to slump yep his back is beginning to bend as if under a heavy lobe and it is a heaviness man burdens are not lighting you just carry your burden could you imagine carrying everybody's Burger come on you just carry your brother and your your burden's in the maybe the onesie too your little group that you pray for and then your pastor has your pastors have have their burdens that they carry plus the whole church and their group that they're associated with and they've got those burdens and they're heavy you'll know how heavy those burdens are baby you think oh when you're fighting the worst battles you've ever fought and then the phone rings and somebody else and they're oblivious to the battles that you're fighting oblivious and he doesn't say a thing because he don't want to add to your problems right I know your problems are bad too we've all we're all in this battle together so you just kind of shoulder up and take another burden right man here's Jesus he wasn't just carrying the Lord of one man no or 12 disciples or or a hundred people or whatever he's carrying the burdens of the whole world right oh and not just the whole world is in what was presently there I forget what the population of the of the world was at that time but we're talking about all that had come since Adam that's right and all who would be from 33 all the way through 223 and whatever whatever time it will be when the when the when the Rapture takes place he's he's carrying all those or at least they're they're descending he's he's starting to feel the weight of this thing there's a reason that he was beginning to to to to kind of to to cry and to begin to try to prepare the disciples as he was getting closer because he was he knew what was coming it's expedient that I go away he knew what he was he knew what was coming he knew what kind of going away it was going to be that's right the son of man they shall do with him as they as they want to do and I'm going to be crucified and die and all these things and perhaps his disciples they didn't understand it and they were just thinking oh you know he's he's he's he's having a hard time or whatever they didn't understand but he knew he sure did he knew and it's a heaviness that descends on his heart he knows what's just ahead and perhaps with their eyes we could just kind of catch a glimpse of our precious Lord is he maybe he glanced up just a little bit his brows are drawn together and yep we think you know well there's there's the mighty king if we've gone back in time we we know we know the outcome right yeah there's a conquering King yeah yeah oh Hallelujah but remember before he conquered he had to go through the greatest battle that had ever been found Gethsemane the word Gethsemane literally means all press and this story to say this probably perhaps an oil press that was there at one time so they named it Gethsemane and everything else there may have been but I don't think that's why it was named that I think God knew exactly what he was doing when he inspired somebody to answer it or to name it that because he knew that when he was going to go to that place he was going to be pressed he's going to be pressed and and then through the pressing father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me right right we're talking about this 100 man but 100 God at this time he's the fullness of the godhead bodily still within him at this time he is the fullness of the godhead bodily 100 man but the flesh still had it was still being pressed and he's still to the point knowing what was coming knowing all these things he still Cried Out Lord father if it be thy will amen saying that the flesh was kind of not real sure if it was his will or not now he knew he only wanted the will of the father right but if the pressures were so great on Jesus yeah don't let that devil tell you that just because you might have had second thoughts or doubts come on now that's right or a hesitancy about things don't let that don't let that devil tell you well see you're not a child of God a child of God wouldn't ever think that way a child of God wouldn't ever feel those things he'd be all the way going listen if Jesus could cry out father if it be thy will let this cup pass for me oh my what would this weaker vessel do praise the Lord Heaven and Hell are gathering over this spot and they're about to come together with a great Clash yes the battle's about to be engaged they're going to come together with a great crash a great cataclysm on the the Earth on the earth and in a man called Jesus and if we didn't have faith if we didn't see through our eagle eyes into the future and know that Jesus had won the victory there and Gethsemane brother Brown said he won the victory there before he ever made it to the Cross if it had not been for Gethsemane he would not have been able to make it to the Cross think about that if it not been for our gethsemanes over and over and over again we never come to the ability to stay on that cross amen the peace of God let him come down from that cross and we say okay here I come right watch it I'm gonna be like the the Filipinos over there yeah yeah you know they're they're crucified today they crucified themselves Bunches of them the church has tried to denounce and all these different things but there's a certain section and people can tourists can go and they can be crucified wow I think they tie them up I don't think they actually drive nails to them but they they whip themselves do you see them doing that you saw them whipping themselves in the blood flying and everything else and they would throw them up on that cross you know what before it came time to say it's finished they said okay I'm good get me down right and that tour guide said okay let's get him down put that money in my pocket how many men could care how many men could carry what Jesus is about to take on his shoulders no sir none driver and if we couldn't see what we what we know if we didn't know what we know you'd look at that and you think how that's not possible and I take that from and forgive me for for even mentioning his his name here in a church setting in a message Church setting but Mel Gibson years ago wrote did a movie produced a movie called The Passion of Christ right I watched it one time and that was all I could take I know people live watching I'm not saying if you're one of them that's just fine but people have watched it many times over and then and it's something to watch it just every year it's like a thing they have to do I couldn't do it it was so it was so and they they asked they asked Mel Gibson they asked him after the movie they said Ah that's not real no man could do that right and he said that's the point he's God yeah they said How can any man do this they said he's God right and we look back and we know that yeah yeah right but if we didn't have the eyes of faith we wouldn't be able to say that but glory to God we know we know yes sir you know if there's anything about Good Friday that we should take you know that we should take from this is we look at Good Friday and we say always because he did he took my sins yes Me Filthy sinner deserve to hell yeah no hope no way nothing I can do but the grace of God hallelujah the grace of God would come down and be made flesh and blood and become a king's folk to me amen a human 100 man and he could take it yes and when he died on that cross when he said it's finished it's finished oh I can look at that and I can say God it's finished you cannot lie it's done I don't care what happens it's done the Lord wins God wins death hell and the grave are firmly and forever defeated in the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen that's right and every demon of hell is indisputably trounced once and for all I love this quote here this is the 1964 possessing the Gate of the enemy I got a ways to go you hold on you're good so he said now when when he was hey you heard it he said okay so he said now when he was on Earth he conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had the Royal seed you get to sleep in in the morning you're okay amen he had the Royal seed he promised it by the word he conquered it right he conquered it he says he conquered the Gate of sickness for us praise the Lord that's what he come to do remember sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it right the other men had to conquer their own gate but you don't have to conquer it it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness what did he do when he conquered the gates of sickness saying that he would whatever you ask on Earth or whatever you bind in heaven I'll bind it in heaven or bind on Earth I'll abide in heaven give us the keys to the gate he conquered the Gate of Temptation by the word and the keys was resist the enemy and he will flee from you he conquered all he conquered every sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered death and Hell amen it wasn't a separate you put those two things together and he conquered it amen he conquered what others could not conquer because they're the natural seed but this is the spiritual seed he conquered the gates of the Grave he rose up on the third day for our justification and now we are more than conquerors we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors hallelujah amen glory to God we just walk right into it that almost makes it sound easy don't it oh it almost does but when you look at what he did that's right oh God thank you Lord amen right thank you Lord he said now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated yeah that's right death is defeated hell is defeated everything's defeated Oh my he says I wished I was twice my size now maybe I'd feel twice as good Hallelujah it says brother knocks on the pulpit amen I can understand that you actually want to shout don't it amen amen he conquered it all and now we just have to walk into our inheritance walking is hard sometimes it does but you just keep on walking Hallelujah and then he finishes by saying we are disputing with a conquered enemy that's right that's right praise the Lord praise God Hallelujah he conquered every enemy every demon he conquered all yes when he rose up on the third day now don't take that for granted don't begin to say well it was a slam dunk see what he's God that's what Mel Gibson said well he's God but even as graphic as he made it he still didn't touch it and he still didn't get it you know if he'd really got it he wouldn't be still being Orthodox Christian an orthodox Catholic out there right right he would have walked away from that thing he'd been a fanatic amen amen amen now he's just a crazy man in an Orthodox Christian Orthodox Catholic yeah is that me or is that you amen come on say well it was it was God and it was already spoken you think about you said well it was already spoken and it was predestinated to happen of course he could do that well you know come on dang it come on just in my simple way of looking at things and just taking what what we know yeah it's also written that's right it's also written that you yes would overcome that's right right it's also written that you are predestinated yes to overcome yeah right and to set with me and my throne even as I sat with my father in his throne Hallelujah as I overcame and sat with my father in his throne amen he said what the hell is God who do you think you are anyways right [Music] you're the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you are the body he is the head yeah you are the Earthly expression of a Heavenly God hallelujah you are the vessel that God inhabits in this day not just God above us and not just God with us but God in you yes amen that's right it's written amen amen when you feel like falling when you feel like quitting I want you to say it's written that's right when you feel like giving up and there's nothing you look out there and there's no hope come on brother I used to say that preaching the longer I've gone the more I see that amen there's things I can look at and in my life and and things I can look at I said there's no hope come on sure I'm human yeah yeah I'm human what I do I can't do anything all right I'm helpless yep I can't I I don't even what would I do come on brother and I'll just be Plum honest with you lean on it that's right I'll get up under the inspiration like this or the inspiration at home and I can preach my heart out and I can encourage you and everything else and my wife can tell you I go home yeah I know yeah heading down and don't even talk yep all right Mondays I can tell you not to whine right buck up little camper yep do whatever yep and on Mondays I'm going out of the door like this I'm oh ow oh my goodness gracious I want to lay in bed hit that snooze do whatever I have to do just cause it's written don't mean it's easy but God didn't call cream puffs all right right come on he didn't call flower children he didn't make us for a flowery bed of ease brother Brown said he's calling rugged soldiers rugged soldiers of the cross they can stand there when everything falls apart and say God you were still gone and you are still in control come on and blessed be the name of the Lord you can take away you can do this you can do you could take the Hedge away I believe he has in this last day and we ain't seen nothing yet come on but it's written yeah all the battles he faced we go through our own little portion of hell and all the demons that go with that but he faced them all come on yes sir I gotta climb back up on my perch here I'm about there one more hour I'll be done okay all right you heard him just kidding I'm not all right well I can just see him through my again through the the eyes of the eagle here through this this this Vision that we have looking back this time travel whatever you want to call it I can just see him as he's walking up to to Gethsemane here and the disciples are following him just as clueless as clueless could be tired sleepy listen this is night time they've already they've already had a Last Supper you know how it is when you have supper you get sleepy afterwards right they've already they've already had their feet washed right they've already went through the strain when Jesus is sitting there and they're saying you know he said one of you will betray me and and judah's sitting there and every one of them not one of them looked at Judas and said I knew it all the time that's right so we do sometimes I knew that was that brother I knew it right that ain't what they did what did they say almost and with one Accord they all said is it me Lord is it me all right that's right they knew they had something there was something there that made them doubt themselves right right Jesus said he it is it's the one who dips his sock right in the Bowl yesterday I don't understand that terminology but that's okay because Judas did it and he said do what you got to do man and he went out yep hi and the disciples had no clue they knew something was going on they'd heard the words that he'd spoken and all these things they perhaps had felt his mood change I'm sure his mood had changed perhaps he was becoming more withdrawn wow all the as all the Demons of hell were beginning to gather around him the atmospheres were changing around him you can feel things that other can't feel right right the atmospheres begin to grow heavy demons were were coming together they were coalescing they were con they were condensing they were they were drawing closer and closer and closer they were being drawn by that life that dwelled inside that precious and Sacred Heart oh my and we wonder sometimes why the devil just seemed to zero in on us brother Brandon makes a statement that you can live so close to to Christ that the devil can't even find you and you think man he found me amen well he found this he didn't find me right praise the Lord amen he didn't find the Christ inside of me he didn't find the real me there you go but we wonder why do these things happen well this is why because they recognize that life that's inside of you they recognize the life of their enemy living in you and they hate that life when God said at the beginning that he would put enmity between the two seeds yes that word enmity means a hatred that's right a hatred a conflict between mortal enemies right they hate you that's okay devil I hate you too I can't say that about my brother about my people around there I hate you don't tell even if you don't like them but don't don't say you hate them but I hate that devil right come on that's the truth they're drawn to their life like a bug to the light and they recognize that life of their enemy inside of you and as all the Demons of Hell begin to gather and press against Jesus as he climbs climbs up to the garden yeah and in the heavens in the heavens Jesus looks up and the stars are starting to line up oh my can I go there just for a minute and the Stars are lining up now I'm not a astrologer and I don't go through the papers and read my my signs it's crazy how those things line up sometimes though ain't it but I know what the prophet said and we don't go by all that stuff right we don't we're reading our horoscopes and all like that but what I do know I do know because I can I can do research on the computer now right they've got these wonderful little programs apps on your iPad and everything else and they'll show you where the stars are and where the constellations are for any date in history you see that's how well everything is in control by God that's right it runs it runs on such a such a time that they can literally go back at any date in history and tell you where the the stars were at that time factoring in the wobble of the earth and everything else yes so yeah I'm not an astrologer but I can I can flip an iPad buddy oh and I don't know all those things but I do know of the three major constellations that were in play on this Passover week in 1990 years ago and if you'll bear with me just a minute I want to go through this and we'll we'll close here and we'll just trust the Lord to bring it to a crescendo and we'll we'll have a wonderful time but now I do know this I do know that God wrote his word in the Stars right and in the southwestern the southwestern sky as we're standing in the temple Standing On Top of the temple now and hanging over the upper room it's amazing it was over it's in the sky there over and behind the upper room the southwestern sky Justice Judas just as Judas is about to dip his sop in the bowl and go out to deliver Jesus up to the to the chief priest in the southwestern sky there's a scorpion Rising with its stinger poised just cocked back yeah and ready to strike we call this constellation Scorpio that's right it's the Scorpion yes and I believe that Jesus could look to the Stars seeing as how he was the one that created him he knew what was going on right the same stars that that the father had reached out there and stopped in certain places and put them there and wrote the the word across the skies to foretell the day that he was living in right there Jesus could look up and he could see that enemy climbing the star steps of Heaven that's right and he knew what was coming he knew what was coming as he's walking the Gethsemane he's seeing that I just kind of think he must have he knows all things right the father knows all things and Jesus knows what's coming and maybe perhaps he he understood I know he could he understood that part too and he knew what was coming in there and there's the enemy ready to strike yes sir the word declared victory and Jesus believed the word he'd already testified to the word declaring his faith there he said tear down this temple in three days I'll raise it up again and I have the power to lay my down my life and I had the power to raise it back up again right yes sir Hallelujah Jesus Jesus knew what was coming and what the end would be but that still didn't make it easy when he looks back and he sees that enemy there right yes sir and as the greatest battle that's ever been fought came together in the Garden of Gethsemane he bows his head in prayer and he begins to pray father if it be thy will let this cup pass for me amen father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but it wasn't the father's will right come on and the Scorpion climbed higher and again sometimes it feels that way when we pray Lord get me out of this situation Lord I feel awful Lord Heal Me yeah right Lord bring my kids back in amen come on right his flesh was crying out if it be thy will let this cup pass from me his flesh knew what was ahead there and even though in his spirit he wanted the father's will that flesh still cried out that's right but Escape wasn't the father's will oh for the word of God had something so so much greater in store for Jesus amen praise the Lord uh-huh don't give up when Deliverance is long and coming right right when it seems we have been abandoned and our prayers have not just been turned down but just turned upside down or worse it seems like they fall on deaf ears listen God is not deaf amen God hears you we have this confidence that he hears us when we pray that's right God knows what he's doing and if God says no I will not remove this suffering oh my come on now he knows it's because there's a greater Victory coming greatest Victory I know is when we walk up that Glory way in a new body character this form character is just like his character Hallelujah right that's right there's a victory coming much greater Victory coming my goodness when we stand for him over everything else of the world our our friends turn us down our family turns us down or this one turns us down everything else but Lord I'll stand for you he knows he knows Jesus looks back and he sees the Scorpion raising up over there and he goes in he begins to pray and as he begins to pray and that devil begins to berate him and all the forces come together and and those devils are coming there you think you're able do you think you're worthy you think you're this you think you're that or if you really were who you said you were and all these things and you've got to take he knew he had he was a sacrificial lamb for the world he knew why he had come into the world he had to take every bit of it so Jesus looks around he says I'll take that one I'll take that one I'll take that one I'll take his sin I'll take her sin I'll take that one and he went down the list somehow or another he went down the list from everybody from Adam and Eve all the way down to the last seed that comes in Hallelujah everyone that the blood of Jesus will cover the sin for he took it there in the in the in Gethsemane amen right Satan says you think you're able he said I'm more than able Hallelujah [Applause] pass from me but nevertheless nevertheless not my will thy will be done I'll stand for you I'll take it yeah perhaps he could turn around as he stood up to go back to the disciples for the second time and say it's enough get up let's go perhaps he looks back over there at that constellation of the Scorpion and rising up just above the Scorpion is another constellation another constellation the Scorpion represents the seed of the serpent but just above the Scorpion in the sky there was a man standing up too come on come on there was a man standing up yeah praise God Amen he's not left us alone when the enemy comes in like a flood he'll raise up a standard right he'll raise up a standard and there was a man standing up in the heavens and this man had a serpent in his hand glory to God yeah to the Greeks this this this constellation this man that it represents is is I'll not this will not be right I know but it's officus nope that's not right it's something like that anyways but what it means is serpent Bearer yeah amen serpent bear that's what that name that I can't pronounce that's what it means serpent Bearer so as a scorpion is ready to strike and Jesus comes to the place where he's saying not my will but thy will be done he looks and there's the man standing there with a serpent firmly in his room now there's a struggle going on because the serpent is also twined around his leg and he's standing there in the Stars God writing out the struggle in the Stars there's a scorpion but here's the man the conflict's taking place and Jesus says I'm more than able because it's written in the stars it's written in the word that the man will stand Hallelujah and he'll grab that serpent by the by the head Hallelujah the Bible said that that serpent will bruise your heel but you will cross his head you will cross his head and that's exactly what he had going on he was in the process of crushing that head Hallelujah Hallelujah they cast Officer says some mythological figure that wrestled with snakes or something I didn't have time to go into all the back story of that forgive me for that but but this ain't some Greek mythology that we're talking about here this is the word of God Written in the Stars amen when God first began to express himself in word form when he said let there be light I don't Hallelujah he was already standing he was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world glory to God Amen yeah the Greeks and the fortune tellers don't own the Stars God does God does amen amen and again I know we don't govern Our Lives by reading the horoscopes and all the different things and reading those signs but there's truth in them brother Brandon pointed all that out you know that's right he did sure did I don't know why I feel like I have to say that and give that disclaimer every time I talk about that but brother Brown said so right yeah so as a scorpion with this deadly Stinger is rising there and about to strike so was the serpent Bearer The Man Who wrestles with the serpent and as Jesus struggles in the garden he lays hands on those demons he lays hands on those demons and he grabs them there and in the heavens in the spiritual Realms there must have been such a blast that went out that shook everything amen when those two forces came together and Jesus Christ the Messiah the word of God made flesh and blood and Satan that great Arc enemy of God and all that is Godly and all the Demons of hell they just ran full speed full speed into each other in the garden and the angels of God stood off speechless and watching because they could not join The Fray they were sidelined by God himself you heard the story brother Branham said you just hold on Gabriel said I'll go and I think he was talking about the three Hebrew children at the time but right I'd say pretty much applies here too yeah absolutely Gabriel says I'll go no no no no no wormwood said I'll go I'll pour out the flood and I'll wash that fire out I'll take them Devils out of that Garden God said you hold on this is a god-site that's right that's right this is a god-sized job yep Hallelujah Jesus knew that he had to do this alone he was the man who must deal with the serpent amen and God had prophesied thousands of years ago when the first man and woman fell there in the garden and were being cast out of the Garden of Eden God says wait wait don't nothing to hold on I'm not going to cast you all for good yeah because you see I love you you're the apple of my eye I can't do without you you know we think sometimes with the different ones if they do us wrong we're going to cast them out and be done with it that's not the spirit of God we think if our family does this or that that's not the spirit of God God says wait and we'll fix this I'll Make A Way man couldn't make a way but I'll Make A Way brother Brown said he put Adam and them on the Covenant they said if you do this I'll do that he said but man couldn't do that so he came back by his love he come back through Abraham and he said I'll do it unconditional right I'll do it praise the Lord Jesus Hallelujah and he did he did yes sir amen praise the Lord Jesus I'll come myself as the woman's seed yes yes and I will prevail Oh Glory to God praise His name Hallelujah all those things amen and God came as the man the seed of the woman and the serpent Bearer yep right and this in the stars the man grabs the serpent and the Scorpion still Waits with his deadly singer and hold the battle that presses and pushes and rages through the Flesh of Jesus his brow drought ground is crunched together in the great distress great drops of sweater farming and running down his face those riblets of sweat began to turn crimson red as the cells the blood cells began to burst under the pressure that he's under this time the strain of his being and what he's doing at this time and oh the battle that's raging amen and then Jesus begins to get up he gets up he rises up with the battle still raging inside of him because now he's got all the Devils of hell firmly firmly locked in him and we've not even come to Calvary yet you see why he said it's the greatest battle ever fought I can see him maybe perhaps the flesh struggling to rise to his feet those precious feet with all the Devils of Hell riding and digging into his flesh there were sugar diabetes riding in that flesh that's right right there was heart issues riding in that flesh there was cancer eating in that flesh that's right there was mental battles riding in that flesh there was depression there was anxiety there was all the different all the Devils of hell were riding and tormenting that flesh he was taking them every one and they're beginning to take hold with every disease and attack that Satan can mount and as Jesus rises in those great drops of sweat and blood that begin to fall I want you to know this I want you to listen to me as Jesus got to his feet those Devils didn't have him he had them [Applause] he had them right Hallelujah he had them firmly in his grip I can imagine so we got him now and also one of those Devils goes oh I'm feeling kind of constrained here come on what in the world give me some room yeah Jesus has them firmly in his grip amen glory to God yes sir that little body that little frail body oh my the iron that must have been flowing through them veins at that time and they were just locked on those devils Hallelujah and the man holds the serpent riding over the side over the over the Scorpion and then Jesus is captured he's taken into pilate's Hall he's taken before Herod and Oh my he had to be brought all the way back from Gethsemane all the way back to the other side of the temple just above where the upper room or the room where they were saying that just above that room is where herod's herod's Palace was he's carried all the way back over there and man and put in front of pilot and and when we know the story how pilate we didn't want to crucify him but but not really believing either so so he tries to wash his hands of it all and I think of the many folks today who try to do the same thing with this message and and we've spoke many times of those who've come against the message selling out in a Judas kind of manner they do but but what about the many who stand judging the message and don't say anything they don't want to say bad things about it just in case it's really true but yet they'll not fully commit to this message either and Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and the word for their day amen so they try to wash their hands of it all and walk away but it's impossible to walk away from it listen don't think you can stand in Judgment of this word deciding what is right and what is wrong picking and choosing what to take and what not to preaching don't think we can stand judging and get off scot-free all right Jesus is crucified afresh like that that's right amen but God does the final judging amen and it did not end well with pilot the male the man held on to the serpent perhaps Jesus looked to the heavens and he saw the battle raging and as they beat him and they scourged him they tore chunks of Flesh from his body and he'd look and the man was still standing yep so he still stood yeah that's right and they would Mock and they would do this and they would do that and they'd all slap him and spit on him and he'd look and that man was still standing yeah [Music] and as the sun rose on Friday Nissan 3 April the 3rd they let our Lord off to Calvary yeah now we come to Good Friday in the last five minutes and they nailed our Lord to that cruel Roman Tree and as you hung there with the weight of the world upon his shoulders with the Scorpion still ready to strike at any moment remember death had to plunge its stinger right but as he hangs there on that cross perhaps he could look there and he could see that scorpion ready to strike but then there was another sign rising in the southwestern Skies and if you were to stand on top of the Temple in Jerusalem and you looked West you would be facing Golgotha and also the tomb of a certain rich man named Joseph of Arimathea yep and on April 3rd 33 A.D there was another Heavenly sign and the Bible said that the son refused to shine from the sixth hour until the ninth hour right that's a three-hour blackout right right some say that the Stars themselves blacked out some say it was a solar eclipse but it couldn't have been a solar eclipse because it was a full moon at the time solar eclipses only happened in the new moon which was two weeks prior to that wow so we're half a month off it couldn't have been a solar eclipse and and the the astrologers can they've gone back and they can tell you no there was no solar eclipse on that day and they talk about brother Brown and missing his dates yeah wow and during a solar eclipse the other stars don't go out in fact they almost look brighter in a way but here they all went black here's what I think happened come on I'm not making a Doctrine out of this or anything else but but I think what what happened the Angels were literally turning their back come on the angels in one place he told pilot or he told the priest he told him forgive me my mind is totally blank he told him there he said do you not think that I can call more the 12 Legions of angels all right right yeah you have no power over me but what God gives me that's right where God gives you right I could call 12 more than 12 Legions amen a legion a legion was up to is a very number of was up to six six thousand six thousand one hundred and eighty two I believe it was foot soldiers and then there were 726 Calvary at the highest number so you had at that time you had over 6 800 angels that he could have called where were they at right well he didn't call him we know he didn't call him but I guarantee you they were there yeah yeah they were there just waiting on it just give us the sign move your pinky do something right right but he couldn't do it because if he had done that where would we be right where would we be so instead I think they had to turn their backs not in rejection but in grief yeah they turned their backs on Jesus as he hung there on the cross out of sadness they couldn't bear to watch as he hung there and God himself forsook him and about the ninth hour he cried out my God my God why is thou forsaken me he cried it's finished and he gave up the ghost the Bible says also that the moon would not give her light there wasn't a solar eclipse but there was actually a lunar eclipse that happened on April the 3rd A.D 33. wow and and actually the main proof that many and that's actually the main proof that many hold for saying that Jesus was born on zero some say he was born on four A.D others say he was born in zero but this is one of the things that they they give us a sign that said no he's born he's born zero that was the ending of BC and the starting of A.D right and and they and he died in in 33 and they look at the sky charts or whatever you call them and they say that there was a total there was a lunar eclipse on that day and the Bible said that the moon didn't shine and some say it would have actually been when it when it come back and all the the routing up and everything else it would have been a blood moon it had been a blood moon with the Moon turning red yeah yeah and oh my as the Lord was hanging his head and his Spirit was leaving his body as the blood was emptying out upon the Earth the moon was turning blood it was turning red it was turning to blood and bread and another sign the moon had become had come it had moved over and it was literally they run the charts the moon was literally hanging over the head of the serpent of the Scorpion amen and Jesus could look and he could see that scorpion there and there's a Blood Moon Hallelujah there's a blood riding over the head amen hallelujah and that's not all that you know that constellation was was riding low the Scorpion as it comes up and it's riding low to the Earth and the moon is riding low and turning to blood covered over the Scorpion's head but then again demand don't forget the man because the man during this whole time the man is still standing there with a serpent in his hands damn it it's wrapped around his legs don't sometimes it feels like the serpent like Satan has us all wrapped up but never never never at any point does the snake wrap up the man the man always has the serpent firmly in his hands he's got him in control Jesus was not defeated and Drug away to a devil's hell no sir not at all he drug every tormenting devil to hell to the devil's hell there's a reason they call it a devil's hell because it was created for the devil amen hallelujah for Satan and his angels He drug everyone down there he didn't go as one that was defeated he went as the as the one that had overcome he went as a Victor Hallelujah he won he won and he drove every tormenting devil down with him yeah that's right thank you he's going down to claim what was his life I can just hear those precious feet that just a little bit before [Applause] they've got Nails drove through them and a little bit before they're laying in a tomb cold yep come on but now those precious feet screams Gall around him because he's got all the devils all the devils are there and he's still got a hold of him the man never let go of the serpent that's right and all the devils are still there yeah they're there brother Wade and those feet that not long before we're laying cold in the Tomb now that new body now those now that that theophany now that word body whatever you want to say it is at the time now that one that Jesus is striding purposefully victoriously overcomingly if that's a word amen down through the corridors of hell down through the dark quarters of hell I'm sure before you could see him you could hear Boom boom boom as those feet were falling those great precious feet were falling they were not just a timid feet of somebody walking and preaching the gospel now but now they were the Mighty God hallelujah now they were the mighty king now they were the Conqueror they were the Overcomer amen now they were the kids with the Redeemer rose again amen that was one that was coming and he's booming down through there I can see the darkness as he's going and you can hear the screams of the Devils as he's dragging them down and there's a light though this piercing that Darkness because he is lying amen he is the light of the world and as he goes into that darkness of hell he lights it up Hallelujah and the devils are screaming to the top of their lungs and he goes up to the door of hell and he begins to knock boom boom boom boom those hands at one time not long before were stretched out on the cross saying come to me come to me right amen he stretched them out all that will come come amen raised out like that with nails to him on the cross bleed on the cross now they're holed up in Iron Fists and he's beating on that door boom boom boom yeah oh no yeah oh no I made a mistake I made a mistake open up he couldn't deny him all right I can see that door one bro Brian said he said boom he kicks open the door yeah kicks open the door I like to think he popped the face of Satan when he did that yes has all the sin of the world he is all my sin all your sin yeah amen everybody from Adam Eve amen Seth that's right Abel hey all the way down Noah amen in a keeping right come on Joseph the closest one to him Joseph told the LIE right almost ahead of all of them had mine oh my I could sit here for the rest of the night and tomorrow and the next day too if I started telling you what all I've done wrong with my life he had every one of those things and when he kicks the door open he looks at Satan he says here poof I think these belong to you yeah amen glory to God and he throws them back into the he throws them back into the face of Satan into the lap of Satan where they belong oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God yeah Amen brother Brandon said he reaches in he reaches in and grabs while Satan's busy trying to hold up all these sins he can't stand under the weight of them like Jesus did he might have been the he might have been the covering Angel at one time he might be in the light bearer but he wasn't a sin Bearer hallelujah amen he want the serpent Bearer amen he wanting the Mighty God hallelujah he wasn't the captain of the host he want none of those things and when that weight of all that sin comes in his knees start buckling down and Jesus reaches in and he grabs those keys Hallelujah the keys to death hell and the grave amen these belong to me these belong to me yes amen amen aren't you so glad yeah yeah that he took those keys Laurie hey Hallelujah brother Chris yes sir you want to take over what would it do if he didn't take those keys wow I've got I've got kids locked up come on I need somebody with keys hey that's right where am I come on I've got health issues locked up come on I
