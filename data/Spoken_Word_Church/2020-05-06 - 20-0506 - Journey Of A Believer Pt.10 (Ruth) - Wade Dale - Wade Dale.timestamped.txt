[3:09] come up and interpret
[3:10] the service today so we can send it to
[3:13] columbia
[3:15] to the brothers in columbia they want to
[3:17] hear a sermon but they want to hear it
[3:19] in their
[3:19] their native language and
[3:22] they want to uh
[3:24] feast on the word of god there
[3:26] they don't have the technology that we
[3:27] have um so much
[3:30] to do live streaming so we're going to
[3:32] try to help them out but let me get let
[3:33] me get started on this
[3:35] we're going to start
[3:37] sunday now i want everybody to listen
[3:40] because we had some people
[3:42] that misinterpreted what brother dale
[3:44] said the other day and
[3:46] literally misinterpreted he never said
[3:49] it not one sentence did he say of this
[3:51] he never said that don't worry about
[3:52] coming sunday morning come sunday
[3:54] afternoon that never was spoken so i
[3:57] don't know how that
[3:59] sometimes we pay attention more to
[4:01] television and stuff like that than we
[4:02] do the
[4:04] preacher so anyway we're starting at 10
[4:06] o'clock sunday it will be mother's day
[4:09] so we're starting at 10 o'clock now
[4:10] brother terrence will be locking the
[4:12] door at ten o'clock everybody got that
[4:17] am
[4:19] so be here at 9 45 the reason being is
[4:22] is we're going to seat you
[4:24] every other row family sit together
[4:28] the deacons will be sitting families
[4:30] together if you're an individual we're
[4:32] gonna try to keep you six feet apart
[4:35] fill up the sanctuary then we're gonna
[4:36] fill up the downstairs then we're gonna
[4:38] fill up my sunday school class and have
[4:40] it on the two screens downstairs is
[4:42] everybody okay with that
[4:44] okay the reason we want you here by 10
[4:46] o'clock is and we're going to lock the
[4:48] doors if you come walking in at 10
[4:50] o'clock and we've got everybody seated
[4:52] we're going to have to reshuffle
[4:53] everything everybody okay with that you
[4:56] understand why we're doing that not to
[4:57] be mean but we don't want somebody to
[4:59] come walking in at 10 10
[5:02] and we got to reshuffle everything
[5:03] because two or three people or four or
[5:04] five people walk in so
[5:07] be here now you know what just act act
[5:09] like it's a doctor's appointment you're
[5:11] never late to them
[5:14] just act like it's a doctor's
[5:15] appointment don't act like it's church
[5:16] like a doctor deployment be here at 9 45
[5:19] there will be only one service there
[5:21] will be gifts
[5:23] for all the mothers now that doesn't
[5:24] mean everybody's got a baby every wife
[5:28] gets a gift on sunday
[5:30] um and then if you're not going to be
[5:32] here we'll mail them to you
[5:34] june's already mailing some that we know

[5:38] so everybody got that so far
[5:40] keep your distance no shaking of hands
[5:44] all right got it
[5:46] wash your hands if you are in a high
[5:49] risk
[5:50] if some of our nurses want to come
[5:52] please feel free to come you may need a
[5:54] break
[5:56] but would you please wear a mask
[5:58] just in case
[6:00] all right
[6:01] the rest of you
[6:03] you decide anybody over 61 i think ought
[6:06] to wear one
[6:08] i'm 60.
[6:11] but wash your hands and sister lisa will
[6:14] have a temporal thermometer
[6:16] up here
[6:17] a temporal thermometer in case we need
[6:19] to
[6:20] take a temperature
[6:21] and see if anybody is uh
[6:24] poor jim bless her heart
[6:27] she's sweating hot all the time anyway
[6:29] her temperature may be up but she's okay
[6:30] everybody's good
[6:32] and then look we're going to have that
[6:34] downstairs
[6:35] if you want to stay outside you may it's
[6:38] okay but we now have that set up and
[6:40] that we just got it in today josh and
[6:43] brother joe and and uh brother richard
[6:46] has got it working now and they're going
[6:47] to try to keep
[6:48] through this service go down
[6:50] to their cars
[6:52] but it's fm 107.1 if you'll turn to that
[6:55] you'll get the direct service as it's
[6:57] going on so remember no handshaking and
[7:00] then remember
[7:01] when you get ready to leave the building
[7:03] after sunday morning service
[7:05] no hand shaking
[7:07] and the deacons will escort you row by
[7:10] row just like we do on a wedding or a
[7:12] funeral okay not everybody gathered
[7:14] cause that just defeats the whole
[7:15] purpose if everybody crowds down the
[7:17] aisle
[7:18] so they'll come up to the front and the
[7:20] people in the front will go out the next
[7:22] rows will go out we're going to try that
[7:27] just to see how it works and then i
[7:28] think maybe if everything works okay
[7:30] then
[7:32] we'll do it again
[7:33] okay
[7:34] everybody got that
[7:36] all right start at 10 lock the doors at
[7:38] 10.
[7:39] be here at 9 45 we'll have regular
[7:41] service the sisters can play their
[7:43] instruments we can
[7:44] maybe
[7:46] uh brother aaron if you don't want to do
[7:48] some of y'all that's been playing a lot
[7:50] you might want to step out and let the
[7:53] ones that hasn't played like the twins
[7:55] bella
[7:56] maybe uh if your wife comes
[7:59] sister esther
[8:01] both sister esther's just to give us
[8:04] enough room everybody got that
[8:06] okay
[8:07] and and let them be able to play
[8:10] because they haven't played in months a
[8:12] couple of months and some of y'all have
[8:14] so if you'll just kind of work that out
[8:15] between yourself
[8:16] because i'm not here to
[8:18] to be the song leaders
[8:21] uh
[8:22] you know to be the guide y'all y'all
[8:23] guide yourself as far as playing okay
[8:27] and brother joe's good with that he's
[8:29] the one that you need to talk to anyway
[8:30] so
[8:31] talk to brother joe canada
[8:33] so everybody got that now let's start in
[8:35] our service brother luis will come up
[8:37] we'll
[8:38] we'll get ready to uh to begin but keep
[8:41] everybody in your prayers
[8:43] for this time coming up it will be
[8:44] mother's day weekend
[8:46] as far as i know
[8:49] we're still going to have our june
[8:51] father's day
[8:52] fishing trip uh
[8:54] i don't see where they won't be unless
[8:56] we have something spike real
[8:58] real high but
[8:59] if we'll just keep ourself
[9:02] close to god
[9:04] and i want to make an announcement at
[9:06] the end of the service
[9:09] regarding that because
[9:11] you know during trying times
[9:14] you really tell who you are
[9:17] leaders are not born in peace time
[9:21] leaders are born during times of war
[9:24] or times of battle right all right so we
[9:27] we we know we have the the right
[9:30] leadership with the holy ghost and
[9:31] brother dale
[9:32] but some of us may have felt they were
[9:34] their own leaders so we're going to have
[9:35] a discussion about that but we're not
[9:37] going to interpret it so
[9:41] let's go we're going to stay on journey
[9:42] of
[9:43] a believer part 9 of the book of ruth we
[9:46] did not finish we're going to go through
[9:47] it though again
[9:49] just for our brothers overseas to come
[9:52] up to a point if that's okay and then
[9:53] we're going to look at something that i
[9:55] think is really really awesome
[9:59] when we look at this
[10:02] okay
[10:16] as we looked at the journey of abraham
[10:20] in four parts
[10:22] okay
[10:23] justification
[10:25] sanctification
[10:26] baptism of the holy ghost
[10:28] and placing it
[10:33] and we're going to see that in a couple
[10:35] of parts in the bible
[10:37] we've been through that neighborhood
[10:42] we're going through it in ruth
[10:46] and then if we have time at the end of
[10:47] the service
[10:50] we're going to show you how joshua
[10:52] portrays that in the old testament
[10:57] placing of the people where the half
[10:58] tribe and two tribes stayed on one side
[11:09] okay so we'll see that
[11:11] god bless you
[11:12] let's go to first corinthians 10.
[11:18] and to save time
[11:21] we're just going to read verse 11
[11:22] because we read this last sentence
[11:27] we had a wonderful time with brother
[11:28] duchess this weekend
[11:34] he needs prayer
[11:36] he has no one to back him up
[11:40] and he's having temporary paralysis
[11:47] and his legs
[11:49] so we're just keeping we gave him the
[11:50] prayer cloth
[11:54] and he was very moved that we were that
[11:56] we were doing that for him
[12:00] amen so just keep him in your presence
[12:03] that we're praying
[12:06] first
[12:08] verse 11.
[12:31] and through the holy ghost we're going
[12:33] to see lord i permeable espirito santo
[12:36] our purpose of being here
[12:39] in this hour that we're living
[12:41] father give us this day our daily bread
[12:43] padres
[12:47] save the lord
[12:50] be with the
[13:03] but lord tonight we look to you
[13:07] the author and finisher of ours
[13:11] and we hold on to those promises
[13:15] we thank you for these things
[13:17] jesus name we pray
[13:20] amen amen first corinthians 10 verse 11.
[13:25] now if you read the scripture above that
[13:27] jesus
[13:30] is talking about moses
[13:32] and
[13:45] and then you come up to the scripture
[13:46] here
[13:48] where it says now all these things
[13:50] happened unto them for example
[13:54] and they are written for our admonition
[13:59] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[14:02] aquinas
[14:04] now that's us
[14:06] that wasn't even paul
[14:08] pablo paul was prophesying
[14:11] this is for us
[14:13] a man so it's really really important
[14:15] because this is
[14:16] important that we see the revelation
[14:20] that god's trying to give us in this day
[14:23] you may be seated
[14:27] now if you'll pull up the next slide
[14:31] we were looking at last sunday
[14:37] we looked see the journey of abraham
[14:40] the journey of ruth
[14:42] and
[14:50] not just now we know god is perfected in
[14:52] three years
[14:55] you can't go any higher than having the
[14:56] holy ghost
[15:10] a place
[15:23] it is
[15:38] mistake
[15:41] and brother brown says that is satanic
[15:44] if we don't have
[15:46] character with our power
[15:49] amen
[15:50] so we're going to look at this
[15:53] we've already looked at the journey of
[15:54] abraham uh
[15:57] because the prophet of god tells us
[16:00] that uh about genesis chapter 12 can
[16:03] genesis capitulos
[16:07] god came to abram
[16:09] abraham and abram had to make a decision
[16:13] okay he had to say yes or no
[16:17] or no he had to decide
[16:19] whether to get up and go
[16:21] or stay okay now we're going to see the
[16:24] same thing in the journey of ruth
[16:27] you come to ruth chapter one
[16:30] ruth has to decide
[16:33] whether to go on with naomi okay that's
[16:35] it
[16:36] no emmy or to go back
[16:38] to moab i'm moab okay so she has to come
[16:41] a place of deciding
[16:44] okay so there's justification is
[16:47] justificacion you going and walking in
[16:50] another direction
[16:54] amen amen god forgives you of your
[16:56] pastors
[17:01] and he has to go by your free moral
[17:03] agents
[17:06] just say yes lord i will follow you
[17:10] as abram says lord i'll follow you
[17:14] as ruth says naomi i will follow you
[17:19] amen
[17:21] so ruth is very important
[17:24] it's a beautiful beautiful chapter in
[17:26] the bible
[17:29] amen amen and then we come and look to
[17:31] see the four combat beasts
[17:33] los cuatro las cuatro veces de combatte
[17:36] the lion leon
[17:39] the man
[17:40] the ego
[17:41] that's four
[17:43] all right
[17:44] so we have
[18:26] your
[18:55] all right so now let's read
[18:57] that
[18:58] this quote estacita
[19:01] the next one please the kinsmen redeemer
[19:04] brother
[19:08] he says and this story was written they
[19:10] said yes
[19:12] and all the old manuscripts
[19:15] where they were segregating the bible
[19:18] the holy men when they were trying to
[19:19] put it together los angeles
[19:37] romantic why would the writers and
[19:38] ancient sages accept this book as
[19:40] inspired
[19:45] because there's a hidden revelation in
[19:47] it
[19:49] and in this hidden revelation you catch
[19:51] the real meaning
[19:55] significance and it will bring you close
[19:58] real close to god
[20:02] and i pray my whole soul this morning
[20:18] how
[20:31] but it can only be revealed by
[20:35] amen amen so god bless you let's turn to
[20:37] the book of ruth
[20:40] chapter one
[20:42] now we want to show or
[20:45] before we get started
[20:48] now it's kind of strange that there's
[20:49] four characters
[20:52] uh uh uh personas
[20:54] okay naomi persona
[20:58] is an example of the old jewish church
[21:00] it's an example of
[21:28] so now as we read this
[21:31] you keep in your mind that naomi is the
[21:33] old jewish church
[21:38] she has went out of her promised land
[21:54] she lost
[21:55] her brideship
[22:10] she's telling the two girls
[22:13] muchachas the nominal church
[22:17] and the gentiles
[22:21] you got to make a decision
[22:38] she said you got to make a decision
[22:42] because remember the first step is
[22:44] making the decision
[22:47] to make a decision
[22:51] all right
[22:52] so arfa decides
[22:55] she don't want to go any further with
[22:56] god
[22:58] hey man so she turns and goes back into
[23:00] the denomination
[23:03] or where she came from
[23:05] but what did ruth say okay look here
[23:08] roof said whatever god gives you
[23:11] he's going against me
[23:13] whatev wherever you go
[23:16] where you died
[23:19] what a decision
[23:34] we come
[24:02] so that's rude yes telling nails
[24:06] i'm going with you
[24:08] i'm gonna take all this old testament
[24:12] and i'm gonna build on it
[24:15] so there's no way for me to get to the
[24:17] new york times
[24:18] there's no way for me to get to the
[24:20] promised land
[24:22] without going through that old jesus
[24:23] christ
[24:26] in other words the old testament
[24:31] you glory
[24:31] some water bud no i'm good okay you can
[24:33] count some of that if you want it
[24:34] appreciate it okay
[24:36] just start it
[24:38] start out
[24:40] make a decision
[24:44] amen
[24:45] so ruth says i'm going with you
[24:50] and it just so happens
[24:54] when they return to the promised land
[24:58] it wasn't it
[25:28] we see that
[25:30] god is always talking about maturity
[25:35] as brother dale's talking about now
[25:38] el monodel esta orlando
[25:40] the first fruit
[25:54] the whole field is full total
[25:57] they just haven't matured
[26:02] but when that priest waved that sheath
[26:04] before god
[26:36] hey
[26:47] [Music]
[27:11] but we're getting ready to go into the
[27:13] next stage
[27:18] amen amen so let's remember those is
[27:21] that cordemonos
[27:23] that
[27:24] naomi and ruth and orfo
[27:26] went out of the promised land
[27:31] they were out of the promises of god the
[27:34] last promise their old husbands had to
[27:35] die
[27:37] your old husband's got it
[27:40] so you can go and be married to christ
[27:44] but remember
[27:45] how perfect this is i'm perfect
[27:48] naomi doesn't get a husband
[27:51] that's right
[27:52] she's missed that
[27:57] boss knows though that he's got to stay
[28:00] in the kinsman
[28:28] so he could see
[28:43] sanctification sanctification even in
[28:45] abram yesterday in abraham even in rule
[28:48] yesterday
[28:49] you see them doing things
[28:53] amen amen it's not all works but
[28:56] no
[29:08] i want you to be careful
[29:22] that just means the unclean spirit went
[29:24] out
[29:27] amen amen and you've become under a
[29:30] religious order you stay in trouble
[29:34] and if you stay there
[29:37] remember none of these people stayed
[29:39] where they were
[29:42] kept moving
[29:45] kept moving
[29:47] everybody god wants you to move
[29:51] man if you stop guess who shows up
[30:04] because remember
[30:34] but when you take him out
[30:37] then you let boaz do the work
[30:41] we'll get to that
[30:43] we're going to cut through some of this
[30:44] um
[30:45] maybe we can get back to it a little bit
[30:47] later
[30:54] we see that she
[30:57] just happens to show up in bohez's field
[31:04] now brother brown said she was directed
[31:05] by the holy ghost
[31:09] because i don't believe in luck
[31:12] i don't believe in just happening
[31:16] i believe
[31:28] sometimes you talk to the lord you know
[31:44] diablo
[31:46] i was a name already in your book
[31:48] giorgio nombre en tu libro couldn't be
[31:50] took out no me polly
[31:52] nothing to be done not a police academy
[31:55] so why are we worried about what came
[31:57] after this is
[32:12] and that's satan's problem
[32:15] he got a little exalted
[32:17] but that didn't hurt god's feelings
[32:21] your name come out
[32:25] the eternal section i'm talking about
[32:40] satan
[33:35] that's why brother brown said that the
[33:37] father son holy ghost what is this
[33:39] trinity doctrine
[33:41] came from the pits of hell because it
[33:42] was safe
[33:44] they created it
[33:46] knowing though there's only one
[33:48] mean okay
[33:50] and now he turns and says no
[33:51] no
[33:52] there's three
[33:55] what a deceiver
[33:58] but listen our eyes have been opening
[34:02] to me that's one of the great the
[34:04] greatest revelation
[34:06] is there's only one truth
[34:09] the first commandment
[34:11] israel the lord is three
[34:15] three
[34:17] one
[34:18] amen
[34:29] [Music]
[34:46] what a beautiful beautiful picture
[34:50] so here's ruth she goes to this field
[34:55] and boaz just happens to see her boss
[34:58] no i believe there was a poll yeah
[35:10] and we get the attention of everybody
[36:11] her character
[36:14] character
[36:20] character character
[36:23] sometimes that's better than
[36:27] sometimes that's better than
[36:28] than you know you being preached too and
[36:30] not just speaking
[36:32] your character
[36:34] because the character goes out there
[36:37] hey man your character goes outside
[36:52] you're in a different field
[36:56] they may have been many women they
[36:58] musculated
[37:05] but they were
[37:22] i see she's working
[37:24] okay
[37:26] he didn't have to go to her house to
[37:28] find her
[37:30] in contrary
[37:32] she was working in the field
[37:41] she wasn't out there complaining with
[37:43] the little group over here
[37:47] complaining about their government
[38:02] she had a heart of a servant
[38:05] what is sanctification
[38:15] so ruth had to come through this
[38:16] position
[38:19] god christ
[38:23] caught
[38:24] his attention
[38:26] and he said hey
[38:29] hey hey my my men my my preachers
[38:31] hombres
[38:33] my my fivefold ministries
[38:36] go on out there
[38:38] go on out there and give them
[38:40] a handful of purpose
[38:42] give her some give her some
[38:44] apostles
[38:46] prophets
[38:47] pastors by teachers
[38:51] to help my brothers
[38:55] amen because what was she gleaning okay
[38:57] yes
[39:10] i just want you to say that again
[39:12] no weeds i can't remember you can't say
[39:14] we can't remember what weeds is um
[39:17] okay never mind so anyway uh
[39:20] my interpreter just fell down
[39:23] well anna he fell down
[39:30] but remember no listen she wasn't over
[39:32] in the field
[39:36] and she was picking up yes
[39:39] things that weren't wheat because
[39:52] in the morning
[40:08] and not only
[40:10] did she glean the corners where the poor
[40:12] people were hey
[40:16] lost
[40:17] god said okay my five full minutes
[40:20] she's having a hard time cutting those
[40:22] corners
[40:25] out there in the face
[40:27] as you're going through the middle of
[40:29] the field
[40:30] foreign
[40:50] so she can live
[40:52] same way with you and now
[40:54] god gives us handfuls
[40:57] of purpose
[40:59] brother branham says some in one of the
[41:01] quotes he says on purpose
[41:32] about it
[41:34] there's your priest
[41:36] coming out to the field
[41:39] to the roots
[41:41] and you've got you've got the mature
[41:44] yeah
[41:45] food like
[42:00] but jesus christ
[42:42] you can't give yourself the holy ghost
[42:46] so you've got to go to the one that can
[42:48] give it
[42:50] because the preacher can't give it to
[42:51] you
[42:55] teacher
[43:10] you've got to come to a place because
[43:12] you've got on new god that ruth came to
[43:15] be of rest
[43:18] amen we're going to read it
[43:20] boaz said
[43:22] the scottish
[43:38] didn't lose a piece of property in the
[43:40] promised land
[43:42] her property was out in the world
[43:45] but remember
[43:48] and she started gleaning
[43:51] of christ
[44:04] god didn't give abraham the baptism of
[44:06] the holy ghost in tight dion
[44:11] because of the circumcision
[44:14] no no
[44:15] he gave him the circumcision
[44:19] abraham
[44:23] that god
[44:24] believed
[44:27] abraham
[44:28] and abraham believed god
[44:31] same way with ruth
[44:33] ruth out in the field
[44:47] you can read in the old testament
[45:16] looking
[45:30] i'm going
[45:42] is
[45:58] but when god comes on the scene
[46:01] in human flesh
[46:04] melchizedek
[46:05] and abraham right off the bat yeah
[46:08] that's my lord
[46:11] by the communion stars
[46:15] and i'm sure that melchizedek you know
[46:17] he's leaning back in that chair he's
[46:18] full yeah
[46:24] drink milk tomato put some butter on
[46:26] bread
[47:05] [Music]
[47:07] is
[47:23] jesus but he would always recognize
[47:26] there's no greater faith
[47:31] couldn't call him son of david
[47:34] same with ruth
[47:36] tambien
[48:03] you've been fighting for 25 years
[48:33] k because they remember abraham and
[48:35] sarah
[48:38] there's your three is justification
[48:42] of the holy ghost
[48:44] abraham get circumcised
[49:15] just annoyed me had to tell her what to
[49:17] do
[49:20] so paul
[49:22] pablo this is fresh it's just for this
[49:24] paul pablo
[49:26] looks meter
[49:28] in the old testament
[49:31] and writes the new testament
[49:35] so you can't do away with that
[49:37] she's still there i put it i just
[49:38] thought you said he's the inheritance
[49:41] but paul is now gleaning
[49:56] is
[50:09] so now we come to this root resting
[50:15] which is the type of the holy ghost
[50:18] now look what happens
[50:22] at the end of the harvest
[50:24] an el fin de
[50:38] so he crawls up at the top of the heap
[50:42] and lays down
[50:46] he crawls up to the top of the heat
[50:52] brother brown
[51:01] and have plenty of land
[51:04] before he could do the rite of religion
[51:34] [Music]

[52:42] and throws it over
[53:12] all
[53:24] he says ruth you stay here
[54:10] tambien right you gotta take root
[54:14] and he goes
[54:15] [Music]

[55:04] remember being a type of christ
[55:07] they had to meet him outside the city
[55:12] where was christ crucified
[55:15] outside the city
[55:18] it was at the gate
[55:20] what did god tell abraham
[55:23] you shall possess
[55:25] the gate
[55:27] of your enemies
[55:29] and what was the right of redemption
[55:44] well let's go back to moses

[56:25] he has no shoes on him because he's
[56:27] almost got he's almost naked

[57:58] until isaac got a little lost
[58:04] and he took him to calvary
[58:06] he
[58:20] and

[1:11:29] see if we can get a picture of this now

[1:25:02] us and
[1:25:03] and
[1:25:05] um and
[1:25:06] opinions are opinions they're just like
[1:25:08] noses everybody's got one
[1:25:11] and it's okay if you have an opinion if
[1:25:13] you want to talk about an opinion
[1:25:14] brother dale go talk about it to brother
[1:25:16] dale
[1:25:18] but i want to admonish you if you put it
[1:25:20] online
[1:25:23] if you put it on facebook
[1:25:27] with your little name on top and your
[1:25:29] cute little picture beside of it
[1:25:32] and you tell 600 people that's on your
[1:25:34] facebook page
[1:25:36] certain certain things
[1:25:39] and it's not in agreeance with this
[1:25:40] church
[1:25:42] then we bring it to the church
[1:25:45] because if somebody sees that online
[1:25:48] they're going to go oh that sister or
[1:25:50] brother goes to brother dale's church
[1:25:51] well what are they saying that for
[1:25:55] that's what i tell you leaders are born
[1:26:00] i was thinking about this the other day
[1:26:02] the old saying in football we said you
[1:26:04] know when the when the going gets tough
[1:26:06] the tough get going
[1:26:08] and i've seen this in the handling of
[1:26:10] the situation of this coronavirus with
[1:26:12] even with the governors of this united
[1:26:14] states of america
[1:26:16] now
[1:26:17] i'm not bringing politics into this
[1:26:19] pulpit but i am going to tell you that
[1:26:22] the person in charge right now is doing
[1:26:24] the best he can do
[1:26:27] and if you think you can do better like
[1:26:28] i said before you jump up there and tell
[1:26:30] him how to do it
[1:26:31] but he's doing humanly doing the best he
[1:26:33] can do
[1:26:34] and for some of you to make a phone call
[1:26:36] or make a comment that somebody ought to
[1:26:38] basically shoot him
[1:26:41] get rid of him
[1:26:44] yeah that was said from some people
[1:26:48] no folks you see that right there
[1:26:50] that says brotherly kindness that's love
[1:26:53] the people that hate you and you're
[1:26:55] supposed to love the people you hate
[1:26:58] what are you saying to the world
[1:27:01] i looked at the governors and you see
[1:27:02] the 50 states president trump said okay
[1:27:05] governors
[1:27:06] you handle it because you know what
[1:27:08] you've got the finger on the pulse of
[1:27:09] your state
[1:27:11] whatever you decide we'll back you up if
[1:27:13] you get out of line we'll correct you
[1:27:16] and now we see and during this whole
[1:27:18] pandemic
[1:27:20] some of the governors are doing a
[1:27:21] wonderful job
[1:27:23] and some are not doing so well
[1:27:25] and some have become a bunch of
[1:27:26] crybabies
[1:27:28] now i'm spiritualizing this
[1:27:32] i'm telling you adversity is supposed to
[1:27:35] show us where we're at with god
[1:27:38] famine
[1:27:40] plagues
[1:27:41] pestilence has always
[1:27:45] told me
[1:27:46] where i'm at
[1:27:48] good or bad that's right
[1:27:51] and i work on it
[1:27:54] this has shown me
[1:27:57] how good i am and how bad i am
[1:28:01] it should show you
[1:28:03] because i'm telling you
[1:28:05] for people to get online and give their
[1:28:07] opinions online and make phone calls to
[1:28:09] people and bastion everybody and i hate
[1:28:11] to say this
[1:28:15] but it's mostly female
[1:28:19] the females of this church have y'all
[1:28:21] become so hard
[1:28:25] are you wanting to shoot people you want
[1:28:26] to get people out of the way
[1:28:29] you know if you say that
[1:28:31] i'm just going to say this if you say
[1:28:32] that trump is
[1:28:34] the cause of all these deaths
[1:28:38] what an idiot
[1:28:41] so the next time somebody dies in a
[1:28:42] chevrolet accident you need to go to the
[1:28:44] owner of chevrolet and tell him he's
[1:28:46] responsible for it
[1:28:48] see that's the way out to say
[1:28:50] that's where we've come to that's why i
[1:28:51] tell you when all this rises up
[1:28:54] the good get together and bind together
[1:28:58] the halfway kind of lay out there and
[1:29:00] then they will not see some from now on
[1:29:02] we'll not see because you know what
[1:29:04] you're scared to get out of the house
[1:29:07] or this is so much easier for me to sit
[1:29:10] at home in my jammies
[1:29:12] and watch the service
[1:29:16] but i want to warn you
[1:29:18] please don't put stuff online if you
[1:29:20] have an opinion that's okay
[1:29:23] but if you put it online
[1:29:27] and we hear it don't think we won't
[1:29:32] then it's got to be handled
[1:29:35] but folks this tells us where we are
[1:29:38] this shaking always tells me
[1:29:41] being a christian and you should be a
[1:29:43] christian should tell you your
[1:29:45] weaknesses not somebody else's
[1:29:49] your weaknesses
[1:29:51] if you want to blame anybody for this
[1:29:53] blame yourself and i told you that
[1:29:56] we're you know what nothing happens on
[1:29:58] this earth
[1:30:00] i don't believe at this point in my life
[1:30:02] nothing happens on this earth that we're
[1:30:04] not connected to
[1:30:05] i'm talking about the bride of jesus
[1:30:07] christ it's connected to anything that
[1:30:09] goes on
[1:30:10] and as brother dale said many times this
[1:30:12] may not be the end but look what it does
[1:30:14] it shows what the government can do it
[1:30:16] shows what people can do it shows what
[1:30:19] an uprising can do
[1:30:21] if they keep these if they keep these
[1:30:23] states shut
[1:30:25] you're going to see some civil unrest
[1:30:28] and they got guns
[1:30:35] but are we going to be part of that
[1:30:38] ah are we part of the
[1:30:40] hate crowd
[1:30:42] huh
[1:30:44] come on
[1:30:47] you know we love brother branham and we
[1:30:48] say oh we love what he tells us and it's
[1:30:50] all revelation and
[1:30:52] boy your sisters are going to hate this
[1:30:54] brother brown said
[1:30:55] one of the worst things america could
[1:30:57] have done was allow a woman to vote
[1:31:00] now i'm not a woman basher but i'm just
[1:31:02] telling you what the prophet said you
[1:31:03] know because you're emotional
[1:31:05] i tell louise i believe that's why god
[1:31:07] told me not to have women in this
[1:31:09] sanctuary one part
[1:31:11] during this whole pandemic because
[1:31:12] everybody's nervous and everybody goes
[1:31:14] to yake yeah about things and you're
[1:31:16] doing it anyway
[1:31:18] but i want you to stop it
[1:31:20] quit bashing people
[1:31:23] i don't care if it's the devil
[1:31:27] leave him alone
[1:31:29] he's going to be right there with you
[1:31:33] but this adversity tells us where we are
[1:31:35] it tells us where our weaknesses are it
[1:31:37] tells us where our strengths are just
[1:31:39] like just like the governments just like
[1:31:40] the governors of the united states
[1:31:42] they're all different we're all
[1:31:43] different that's what i was talking
[1:31:44] about placing we're all different in the
[1:31:46] promised land there was different place
[1:31:48] things
[1:31:49] some got oil
[1:31:51] some can handle it
[1:31:53] some got this they can handle it god
[1:31:55] knows what you can handle and what you
[1:31:56] can't handle
[1:31:57] but what remember this is a time of
[1:31:59] revelation
[1:32:01] i mean people even in even in the world
[1:32:04] can't keep a secret
[1:32:06] they got cameras everywhere they got
[1:32:09] phones everywhere and don't you think
[1:32:11] they don't know where you're at
[1:32:13] at this very moment
[1:32:15] you know i love them preppers that go
[1:32:17] and buy all this stuff and put it up
[1:32:18] they build a bunker and they carry their
[1:32:20] cell phone with them
[1:32:21] everywhere they go
[1:32:25] that's just a big old beak and it says
[1:32:27] come on
[1:32:30] one more thing before we finish
[1:32:33] remember we talked about a revival
[1:32:37] now remember there was a revival of
[1:32:39] azusa street
[1:32:41] in 1906
[1:32:43] right at the turn of the century we
[1:32:44] talked about that remember
[1:32:46] talked about that cycle
[1:32:48] but when man started rejecting that
[1:32:50] azusa street movement
[1:32:52] what'd god do
[1:32:54] first world war
[1:32:57] and what happened after the first world
[1:32:58] war
[1:32:59] the spanish flu came in that's what
[1:33:01] they're connecting kind of this to the
[1:33:03] spanish flu came in and killed millions
[1:33:05] then what did i tell you got the people
[1:33:07] started crying out for a deliverer they
[1:33:10] started crying out so we don't have
[1:33:11] anything to combat this even brother
[1:33:14] brown talks about jonah salk how god's
[1:33:16] hand was in that to help that man
[1:33:18] develop a vaccine for polio to totally
[1:33:21] eradicate polio you read those quotes or
[1:33:24] do you just read the ones you want to
[1:33:25] read
[1:33:27] you read those quotes about what brother
[1:33:28] mom says about a virus and all these
[1:33:30] different things
[1:33:32] so now look
[1:33:34] we see people now rejecting the word of
[1:33:36] god
[1:33:37] brother branham came into the healing
[1:33:38] revival now he's gone off the scene
[1:33:41] and the bible tells us that remember
[1:33:43] there'll be no famine for regular food
[1:33:46] it'll be a famine for hearing of the
[1:33:47] word of god
[1:33:49] so now people are rejecting the word
[1:33:52] there's spiritual wars going on as we
[1:33:54] speak
[1:33:56] and look now we got a plague
[1:33:58] the plague falls
[1:34:00] so what happens after a plague falls
[1:34:02] a revival starts because there was a
[1:34:04] healing revival
[1:34:06] started right after the spanish flu
[1:34:08] brother brown comes on the scene there
[1:34:09] in the in the 40s right after the flu
[1:34:12] got finished in 1920 21 and there killed
[1:34:15] millions of people it didn't just kill
[1:34:16] thousands to kill millions of people
[1:34:18] because they didn't know how to handle
[1:34:19] it so what am i saying we're in we're in
[1:34:22] the right time that we're supposed to be
[1:34:23] in
[1:34:24] i think i've said
[1:34:27] i've said we must create a revival it's
[1:34:29] not going to come from bastion people
[1:34:32] and being a halfway christian that you
[1:34:33] can't be in a revival
[1:34:36] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:39] but if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:34:40] i've said many times before that was
[1:34:42] judas's problem now i know the other 11
[1:34:44] didn't have the holy ghost but they were
[1:34:46] predestinated they had a different
[1:34:47] attitude
[1:34:48] but judas was so close to them until the
[1:34:51] day the day
[1:34:53] the night
[1:34:54] that he rejected jesus and turned him in
[1:34:57] they thought he was one of the 12.
[1:35:01] that's how close the devil is
[1:35:04] sitting right among us
[1:35:06] so i'm telling you
[1:35:08] number one your sisters that don't have
[1:35:10] they have unregenerated husbands sitting
[1:35:12] at home filling you full of garbage you
[1:35:14] need to stop it
[1:35:16] i'm just telling you from the pulpit you
[1:35:18] need to stop it
[1:35:19] because brother dale's going to tell you
[1:35:20] he would be a little bit more nice maybe
[1:35:22] i don't know
[1:35:23] but
[1:35:25] sometimes he don't hear every hit
[1:35:26] doesn't hear everything goes on but a
[1:35:27] lot of times he hears more than we all
[1:35:28] hear
[1:35:30] but he's not pleased with all this stuff
[1:35:32] that's going on on facebook and
[1:35:34] telephone calls and all this stuff about
[1:35:36] just
[1:35:37] being totally arrogant and totally mean
[1:35:39] about stuff people that's not a
[1:35:40] christian
[1:35:44] those those people in that dark age
[1:35:48] brother brown said they walked willingly
[1:35:49] into the lion's den
[1:35:52] and the people that was with them that
[1:35:53] were supposedly the ones that guarded
[1:35:55] them and pushed them in
[1:35:57] they saw so much of a love of god
[1:36:01] now folks they didn't hear them going
[1:36:03] well bless god that roman emperor they
[1:36:04] ought to kill him they ought to knock
[1:36:06] him off the
[1:36:08] no they heard jesus christ probably
[1:36:10] singing amazing grace how sweet to sound
[1:36:13] and then roman generals throw their
[1:36:15] sword down and said if they can do it
[1:36:18] i want what they want
[1:36:19] does the world want what you want that's
[1:36:22] my last statement let's stand our feet
[1:36:28] so you can stop the nonsense just
[1:36:30] remember one time
[1:36:33] that's right every how you judge it will
[1:36:34] be judged and meted back to you so i
[1:36:36] would be real careful
[1:36:38] and i'm talking to everybody like i said
[1:36:41] you inside this building i'm not talking
[1:36:43] to none of you
[1:36:44] so you know who i'm talking to

[1:37:16] job that takes you into these places
[1:37:18] that are infected please wear a mask we
[1:37:21] want you being here okay we want we want
[1:37:23] this to be
[1:37:24] something we can open up and show the
[1:37:26] world that we can do it

[1:37:54] worship while we're doing that you know
[1:37:56] just saying listen this is to me it's a
[1:37:59] glorious time gloria
[1:38:01] i mean this time right now this is what
[1:38:03] we've been looking for we read this in
[1:38:06] our newspaper exactly
[1:38:08] a long time ago
[1:38:11] now we just didn't know it was called
[1:38:12] coronavirus
[1:38:14] but we knew something was coming right
[1:38:16] we knew something was going to bring the
[1:38:18] government to their knees we knew that
[1:38:21] and then we go
[1:38:24] and blame it on everybody else
[1:38:27] no
[1:38:28] don't do that i think the bible says
[1:38:31] pray for those
[1:38:32] who have the rule over you
[1:38:35] you'll never see brother branham ever
[1:38:38] bashing a president or bashing of this
[1:38:40] or bashing of that he bashes the devil
[1:38:42] and the sin that we do
[1:38:44] but but but not a not something you
[1:38:46] shouldn't do that
[1:38:48] we shouldn't do that
[1:38:50] we should not we should be what we
[1:38:52] should be spokesman for christ
[1:38:55] not spokesman for the devil
[1:38:57] amen you love the lord i know we it's
[1:38:59] almost nine o'clock so we're going to go
[1:39:01] ahead and dismiss but god bless you and
[1:39:02] love you with the love of the lord
[1:39:04] take the name of jesus with you if you
[1:39:06] need prayer just say a prayer right
[1:39:08] where you at because you know what this
[1:39:10] social distancing to me
[1:39:13] it's i'm telling you it's brought me
[1:39:14] closer to god when i went to dutch scots
[1:39:16] this weekend i felt something i never
[1:39:18] felt before and it was a closeness
[1:39:21] and then you walk in and you hear all
[1:39:23] this garbage coming out from in here
[1:39:26] of bashing people
[1:39:28] and you wonder what in the world
[1:39:31] are we so highly revelated that we can't
[1:39:33] just live the
[1:39:35] basic word of god right
[1:39:37] but you know what we will i promise you
[1:39:40] you'll show your true colors
[1:39:42] you can try to hide it you can try to
[1:39:44] bite it you can try to deny it
[1:39:47] but if you ain't got the goods
[1:39:50] you're going to be found out
[1:39:52] and you're going to show who you are
[1:39:53] we're going to anyway we're either going
[1:39:55] out or we're going up
[1:39:57] let's bow our heads
[1:39:59] to heavenly father we pray lord that you
[1:40:00] would
[1:40:02] be with us on the highways
[1:40:04] lord i pray that what's taken has been
[1:40:06] taken in love lord that with a little
[1:40:08] bit of correction father we all need
[1:40:10] that
[1:40:11] because you're a wonderful father lord
[1:40:13] and
[1:40:13] you want your children to
[1:40:15] lord as the prophet said
[1:40:17] as we were going through this adoption
[1:40:19] and placing the holy spirit comes back
[1:40:22] to the father and says oh they're
[1:40:23] misbehaving and then then he comes back
[1:40:25] and says oh no he's just like the father
[1:40:28] lord we want that we want to the holy
[1:40:30] ghost to go back and say we're proud of
[1:40:33] of this person
[1:40:35] we're proud to proud to live inside that
[1:40:38] person
[1:40:39] lord i pray that you'd be with us be
[1:40:41] with our pastor lord bless him as now we
[1:40:43] come up to
[1:40:44] sunday with all the mother's day
[1:40:46] we ask you bless each mother lord
[1:40:48] and all the ones lord that oh that
[1:40:51] prepare food here and make flowers and
[1:40:54] clean the church and all these different
[1:40:55] things lord
[1:40:57] you know my heart i've never tried to
[1:40:59] bash females
[1:41:01] but they are the weaker vessel you know
[1:41:03] that lord and they're emotional
[1:41:05] and sometimes that's what gets us in
[1:41:07] trouble and even us
[1:41:09] being christians that we're females
[1:41:11] and sometimes we get in trouble with you
[1:41:14] for doing things we shouldn't do father
[1:41:16] forgive us that's all i ask is forgive
[1:41:19] me
[1:41:20] search my life
[1:41:22] and lord let me walk closer to you
