«  52       †        You see, each one of those ages only taken a dip into the Holy Spirit. Justification is a work of the Holy Spirit; sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit, but the baptism is the Holy Spirit.
    That's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down, no messenger to the age, 'cause the Holy Ghost came Himself in His fullness of the baptism. But at the end of the age, as it always ends upon the others, we find there then, the messenger sent; and all these scruples and things are to be placed in their places (See?), like that. Then the rapture comes for the Church.
    But as many is allotting all these different things: the sun turning to darkness, the moon... They put that way back there in the Christian age. They just failed to see them three questions was asked our Lord there (See?), when He answered them.

«  107       †          Now, here, also, a type of the seven church ages, which, in Revelation 10:7, that the great mystery of the Book was to be unfolded by the seventh angel's Message.
108    Now, there's a Messenger above, always, and a messenger on earth. The English word angel means "a messenger." And in the seventh angel's Message, while he was making his proclaiming, his ministry, "then when he begin to sound forth his ministry," not when he started out.
    Jesus, when He started out, He started healing the sick and afflicted. "Oh, that great Rabbi! He's a Prophet." Everybody wanted Him in his church.
    But when He set down one day, and said, "I and My Father are One," that was different. That was different. "And except you eat the flesh of the son of Man, and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you."

Lord we love you and we thank you remember the sick ones Lord the different requests that have been made and all I just thank you for everything in Jesus name amen Sister Christine they said was downstair so she's doing better we're glad for for that all right John 10 okay and Wade bringing there this past Sunday afternoon and bringing his message and I I always told them to go ahead when they're bringing their message go ahead and Minister it doesn't bother me I I'll fit in somewhere but it doesn't make any difference he was speaking about the end you know and how it was so we you'll see this will tie right into it I hope to where that will help each one of us okay John 10 verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that enter entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep now watch it but he that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep now it's explaining who this is and what's taking place right see if we don't come by him we're going to come some other way and be a thief and a robber and it won't work but if we come by him through the door now watch that as we go along into the message it says to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice am of strangers you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now what I want you to think about we won't spend that much time on this but I want you to think about the situation is laying out here that it's laying out who it is we know who the door is we know all of the things we know who the Shepherd of the sheep is and that and it's showing the importance of that and it only mentions the porter right in his job it doesn't mention him in any lineup or any thoughts he's got a job all right now that's what we'll be getting into the Lord willing to go on in through the message now sometime when you get a chance take and just run through the Bible on the little word Porter or especially the word Porters you know plural because there were special people set aside for special events all right you know the porter was and it we read here see and to him the porter openeth the door okay now we know the door we know who Christ is and thing but we'll get to that later if we can but now to just give you a little run through 1 chonicles run it run it through there about ver you know 1 chonicles 9 and read about these things and and there's plenty more but I mean this is just giving you a thought there are the the keepers of the Tabernacle now the porters were the keepers of the Tabernacle they had certain things to take place am mainly you know one point to really to emphasis where they were the keepers of the entry it says in chonicles 1 chonicles 9 and verse 19 they were keepers of the entry in other words the entry they in you couldn't come in if you'll read the whole background and do they'll be setting and they're setting going north east south west see we can go into the combat Beast and the the things like that but not preferring to lead that away but to just give you an example and really they had to do with the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation all right now they were special chosen to be Porters in the gates and one listing of them were that there was 20 and 12 of them and they were to keep up with certain things uh you know and certain offices and certain doings I'm just coming down in Chronicles and their their children had the oversight of the gates in other words it come even down from the porter coming on in to the oversight of the gates of the Lord namely The House of the Tabernacle by Wards they were in uh you know they they had a lot of things to do all right now watch what it says about them then and these Porters now so they and their children see come on down into the family in four quarters were the porters toward the east west north and south so anywhere they would be a door there would be a porter all right and to their Brethren they were in the that were in The Villages they come in after a certain amount of days and things and they even were connected and brought in through the Levites because it would come through into the porters of connecting with the Levites look for these Levites the four Chief Porters so they would name the the special Levites and name them as Porters all right now listen what I'm getting at and they were setting their offices and there were certain things they were over the chambers and treasuries of the horse House of God they had special things a lot of different things if you read it you get a lot of things and they lodged round about the house of God because the charge was upon them and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them in other words they would open up they get a thing to go but if you back up in it and study a little bit you'll find that if somebody was even coming and you see them coming forth way off or something that Porter was responsible to keep up with all of that and he would recognize that and and see who's coming and and declare who's coming and what's taking place all right now watch to it and certain of them had their charge of the ministering vessels all right that they should bring them in and out by tail in other words at the Times some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels and all the instruments of the sanctuary and the fine floor and the wine the oil and the amen frankincense and and the spices and things and one of the Levites un it was the first born excuse me we don't need to go that yeah let's stop there I just wanted you to look at something you know about this Porters in other words what a porter would do the porter opens the door all right now to him it's assigned a special job he's not only insign assigned just to take care of the the door opening he's assigned to the vessels he's assigned to the Tabernacle everything in it there were Porters assigned to that job they had a job to do and everything was taken care of but notice what they said he said they were watching in other words they look Northeast South and West it's like you combat beast and things you can go through and bring that in you know of the things that happening but the main thing I wanted you to think about and get it into your mind how important it is to be a porter and how important his job is now brother randam will emphasize a lot and you'll connect right back in with the scriptures that like you're coming to a man's house and the porter meets you at the door he gives you the Garment to put wrong right you understand what I'm saying you know you come to a man's house everybody in the house it don't matter rich or poor when they come to that house they're washed they're run and there everybody is given one certain kind of Rob one color we call it one material you know and everybody was sitting there looked alike it didn't matter where you rich or poor or what it was it was at Porter's job to make sure all of that was in place all right to him it was given to guard those things you know but it was given to him to open that door amen right see he he had he was in charge of that to make sure that door and we read there in the scripture where it says to him the porter openeth even though he's the The Shepherd of the sheep even though he's the the Great one in charge it's the porter amen that opens the door amen now we know for certainly what we're talking about in that don't we that Jesus said I'm the door and the door is a revelation of Jesus Christ given to whatever age or time or whatever but it's delivered by a porter amen if he don't open the door is not opened but as I said then after he even opens the door and allows you to come in he still has to do with your garment you wire he takes off your garments no matter how rich or whatever you are or how poor everybody's got the same garment cuz everybody get the same baptism of the Holy Ghost right no matter where you're rich or poor when God gives you the new birth he gives it to you he don't give it to the person next to you and it don't matter where they're rich or poor or whatever they are it has nothing to do with it but see it's always a porter involved in it now remember that for later if we get to that part trying to to bring the message all right now what have we been talking about now watch your Porter because your porter porter or how you pronounce it he's going to have to do with that door opening all right and what he's going to have to do in a minute you're going to see him I hope you'll follow me you'll see the Porter's job will be the Jubilee priest amen because he's the one to declare amen right all right now want you that tied together in your thoughts you remember how we brought out to the other night or there the other day the Jubilee priest the prophet gave it twice all right a special job when it come around to a time of Jubilee He was to ride through the land and proclaim a jubilee is coming but now remember what I've tried to emphasize over and over is that priest did not wait until that actual date in other words if it was released we found it it's released every seven years right all right then we went through the Bible and and there's a release then coming to the 50th all right but see he doesn't wait till the 50th comes to Proclaim it right he has to Proclaim it before then see we look at it like well he just comes forward he says y'all free to go now that didn't work in other words if you were dealing with your sevens okay in the sixth year the priest would declare next year is the year of Freedom he would hand that message down to all the others that's why I emphasize if you'll notice it emphasized in the scripture gave but the Levites were connected who's the Levites the priest the preachers so the the high priest didn't write to the land he only proclaimed at Jerusalem you know then others took that message that he had declared and they went forth and told him there's going to be a jubilee you got a year now we can go all the way through and tie back into where even people hung in a city people out out in the fields is different thing but somebody hung in a city you got one year you got one year don't be caught in the city we'll see that later as it comes forth you got one year if you're in a city to get out of there and that's amazing what I'm trying to get you to see is that in that sixth year that high priest would declare there's going to be a jubilee all right that would go through seven sevens to be 49 all right and when it falls at the end of that period or that thought it really builds up in a great thing that I wish you would listen to what I'm trying to say and not argue the point with me you said what do you mean argue well I mean try to get your own idea just listen and then come tell me later whether you agree with it or not just listen to what I'm trying to express it'll bring out a beautiful point because see when you were coming down to that 50th you didn't wait until that 50 come and went out and told everybody you had to prepare it we went through a service or two on it to prepare the people for the coming Jubilee all right so then that high priest would declare on the 48th year he would declare that there's coming a jubilee 49 next year you you following me but then at the same time he's declaring it he's speaking of the 50th because he's telling you hey the 49th is a great thing am but this is a special time this is coming to the Jubilee of the golden jubilee for a 50 and see if you can't see what I'm talking about when brother brandom started in his ministry he was trying to get the word to the people right but yet he was learning himself or increasing right and see then he was growing in Grace and knowledge and the freedom he was declaring in the 50s was only speaking of a time to come it was declaring a freedom of eternal life in the soul of the individual but then when he moves on up into the 60s his message becomes stronger and stronger stature of a perfect man 62 coming in from 62 striking the seal 63 then he said I'm not the messenger he wasn't brother Randon was not the messenger to Pentecost he was not the lady oan messenger he was in that age bringing his message but it's got to fit into a certain spot and I'm just trying to get you to look at it like that see to show how that they would be so perfect to line up with the word do you get tied up in the numbers just forget the numbers get the story right brother R started out trying to de Liberty but what could he declare I'm not against it now you no better even think of some thoughts would be running through your mind that brother Dale's against brother brownon we trying to straighten you know better than now you know what I'm talking about is true you know in brother Brown's early Ministry he had things that were not exactly right in his doctrin because the word had not open right but as it went along the word began to open and as it began to open it began to correct him right in what things he was bringing you said well no no he was right all the time well you you're going to have to argue him about it because he had a lot of things he said about that if you you said well it's just statements like I said the other day where he said you know talking about being to a place to where God could be there and he said I used to think that God hated me and Jesus loved me he said till I found out they were a selfs sameed person well you know what it might have been two years old when he found that out I don't care I'm just making the statement somewhere he found out Jesus and God was a selfs sameed person oh he was a prophet all the time Heen but you better be careful how you're bringing that because we can go down through the message and pick up some things that like him teaching the white horse rider with the Antichrist I mean Jesus Christ until later when the seals broke right like him teaching the the evidence of the Holy Ghost was love now he's the one that said these things so you going to argue with him now that's right we've give them to you so you you can't argue with me about it he's the one that said it he said the Lord come and straightened him out in a vision about his teaching of the evidence of the Holy Ghost I'm trying to illustrate how that he was climbing climbing climbing by illustrating it like the numbers that we were giving under your sevens we proved it by the scripture the prophet that under those sevens as long as you're dealing in a time of seven you're in trouble that's right I like Wade's trying to bring out and I hope he continues more and I'll just say this part the Seven Seals the end of all things well you know what's the end of anything what's the end of anything the beginning of something else are further advancement in what you're doing right so the Seven Seals the end of all things what does it mean it just means that's come to an end it means it's opened into something else it's brought the person of Jesus Christ amen that's why I've always said it like this Jesus only put six seals in Matthew 24 right right but come on folks he was the sevenant you agree with that he was the sevenant seal himself well that what about when he unfolded that and revealed it I'm trying to get you to just simple follow something to where the Bible shows you right where we're at see then brother Brandon was declaring a liberty to still be under a seven that would have limitations because remember how we brought it out in Exodus if a man went into bondage with his wife she come out but if he went into bondage and his master gave him a wife and she had children then they stayed in bondage and he went free right limitations showing things are not exactly right showing that there's a problem there somewhere all right let's see if I can find that one I quote a lot of things and sometimes people say well you need to read now I didn't give them this one excuse me we got crossed up on some of our notes a while ago and had to do some correcting out you remember the statement I've made to you that brother R said the Holy Ghost is still bound off the message the Feast of the trumpets paragraph 206 207 they don't have this so don't ask them if they get it up fine says while this group down here has got 2,000 years bound at the ri 2,000 bound at the river Euphrates and has been bound for 2,000 years now listen we know that's what's bound there listen also that church has bound the Holy Ghost Now read it that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years I know that's false fine come on just hold on under Maran back Di martyrdom and there and under the church AG it's been bound not at e euphra river Euphrates but theor of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Ghost can't work in the church because of man-made systems that's right so the Holy Ghost never been free in the church the way God wanted it to be right amen is that what he's saying but it's to Door Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit came can't work in the church because of man-made system but she's going to be liberated now if you say well she wasn't bound down to there well then he sure is talking about going something going to be liberated he said she's coming back that's what the Bible says right you say yeah but the Holy Ghost was free on the day of Pentecost amen it was free but before it ever done very much Freedom they started putting limitations on it and bound it amen God can't work where denominationalism is at no and you know that are you following what I'm saying that under those sevens you could never get totally free that's that's all I've tried to emphasize and seven is the last number there's not an eight there's only seven days of the week eight is eternity amen right so what is the Eighth Day when the seventh day is finished you got the eighth day if you want to call it to one back on the next 50 I ain't going to argue no points with you I'm just going to make the statement it's just it's the point of what I'm talking about the ending of the seventh seal is eternal life if you don't believe that read the quote way gave our Wednesday where brother Brown said it's the end of the Millennium it's the end of this it's the end of that it's he said it's even end of the seventh seal well you know why it's the end of the seventh seal because when it's revealed you have the very product of what you've been looking at that's all I'm talking about under those jubilees back there they would have a release what did the prophet call the 77 49 he said the Tope of the seven Church ages so down to the seven Church ages there's never been a holy ghost Freedom yet like you're going to see amen well you looking for a free yes exactly I'm looking for God to move among the church until she'll be a living moving Idol of God well we don't sure don't look like it I ain't got nothing to do with that and you ain't either what you look at and what I look at don't have nothing to do with it it's what God says I'm glad of that am it's what he says about it's not what me and you has our thought about it you say well you looking for great things I'm looking where the Prophet said there'd be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost come among this bride that would take her in the Rapture said she'd be what what would she be an invincible Army Satan would be powerless before her he said you see thank you seen things you ain't seen nothing yet you like that quote he says he ain't been a Revival yet oh revivals are all over brother Dale all revivals done over what about the one of the Bride he said she ain't had a Revival yet he said it'll take them seven unknown Thunders to wake her up you mean to think that we've had all these seven going into it now almost 7,000 years and God dealing with us and dealing with Abraham and dealing with and dealing with all that and you and I going to walk out of here Glory tomorrow rapture's coming and we're gonna we're gonna sail out of here because it's just done I mean is that your thoughts well I'm going to say what you don't want me to say then you might as well go somewhere else cuz ain't nobody here going to hold it to that that's not an idea that's ever been brought here CU if anybody does I'll go against it because I've always looked for a move of God but I I see God moving there's where the trouble's at people don't see him moving they don't look at one sister J you raise your arm you couldn't raise it here one how many more healings we had things help but he just trying to get you to look at something and it's showing that it's right there in the scriptures that explains what's going to happen see brother randam come and brought his message he was the porter to open the door for you and I to the revelation of Jesus Christ all right but it just keeps opening what about an open door to where you see Jesus Christ Living in you that's a wonderful Open Door isn't it I know I ain't going to get him know that's a wonderful Open Door is it but what about John in Revelations 4 he looked up and saw a door opened in heaven right he was taken up into the revelation of the word of God through an open door you know what there had to be a porter open that door right come on church then you can see it's not just a numbered mathematic I'm trying to get a thought to you it's the thought of a revelation of what's happened in our day right Paul had the opening of he was the porter he opened the message to the people of that day God using him to open that door to speak to the sheep of the sheep fold right but it wasn't long until they started going back down irenius comes forth a door opens the revelation of Jesus Christ he's the porter he's opened it the he's allowing you to look through the temple is that what we gave while ago that the poor 's job was to do to take care of the temple he's to take care of the whole thing he's to even take care of the money he's to take care of the pots and pans he was take he's over the charge of everything and remember I gave you there I said there like what 120 of them or 170 of them this in one place and go back and read that and you'll find out that David under the anointing was the one that set up those Porters go read during chonicles d David set that up under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and put those people in charge you ain't going in you ain't going in the door unless that Porter opens that door for you see somebody's got to help you come on Church can't we simply get it why can't we see that you sisters you can open the door to your children you are in that part of that open door too You Preach to your children you direct them in Jesus Christ you're opening the door to them that they can see Christ what about then go back and read it there where the porters their jobs Jesus said when the son of man would come they'd have to be a porter that somebody had to come and speak to you and I right but are you following me you remember what we saw in Jeremiah 34 though we saw that even though the freedom was declared by I believe was that a that's right the high priest and other words when it was over with they went right back and took the same people and put them back in bondage can't you see church that even down Through the Ages it is that age would come forth into Christ it would open a door and a great Revival would happen but 3 years later it starts denominating then you come back to the scriptures that what that the porter That was supposed to been one to open the door what does it say about him Jesus said you Pharisees he said you stand in the door and won't go in your yourself and won't let nobody else go in who is that that's your ideas and my ideas contrary to the word of God well I don't have no ideas I just I just believe everything brother around say it now I don't try to be sarcastic I just try to be truthful I'd be real careful how I slung that statement around here somebody might walk up to you and say uh what about this what about that what about this what about that did you believe everything come on I made this statement I know it it really sounds bad I believe everything that's been revealed to me and what that Prophet said did did you read what I said I said I believe everything that's been revealed to me yes sir right now I don't believe what hadn't been revealed I got head knowledge about it and I believe he's right but I don't know he's right until something happens inside of me to make me right right a revelation to come in and see each one of those Messengers they stood there in those ages and opened the door to the people about Jesus Christ and what he was doing look where it had wound up over there and you'll see what I'm talking about that while I said it about the prophet that said what he said that Holy Ghost has been bound sure we can see it was bound by the denominational people we can see it was bound by that but you realize he's the one that just said it now you read it off of there that the Holy Ghost never was free in the people the way he wanted it right if there is why you got a restoration you see as each Age come forth you'll see that your Porter messenger starting with the Apostle Paul was a wonderful marvelous individual with no denominational thoughts and ideas right amen right am I right amen right irus done real good he stayed with the truth from John we're quoting brother Brown Martin brother Brown said the greatest since the Lord Jesus Christ come on you want we get the quotes for you St Martin even the greatest since the Lord Jesus Christ Columba look what he done but now what what I'm saying then you started the Dark Ages and here comes Martin Luther out as a porter standing in the door and said the just shall live by faith but yet he was a trinitarian to the core I got his own writings he did not want to leave the Catholic church he wanted to read form it cuz he knew he couldn't do nothing else with it that's the best way to say it he he wanted to try to get it straightened up it took him years into his doing that he would finally throw down that thing and say that is not the blood see and he was still bound if you don't believe that I'd ask you to read one little message or listen to it restoration of the Bride tree and read it four death Messengers took it down four life Messengers restores it right man's ideas and Creeds is what's put every one of us in the place we are tonight why are we doing here 50 years after the prophet left us I'm saying as much as I can to you and me it's you and me the problems amen the message has been brought God has delivered the message to it he's given us every opportunity you realize we're the only people that have our Messengers message of his words from day to day over some almost what from the 30s to the 50s the 30 years or 40 years that we can read things he said in the beginning a little bit they have about Paul small amount about irenius and Martin and Columba most of it is just a historical types of things you got a few writings of Martin Luther because you had begin to get the printing presses and the things back into motion you had a little more than John Wesley you had a little more in theusa street but I've tried to get you to even think about about that ausa street were trinitarian people well God can't be loose under a trinitarian idea right the Holy Ghost can't work under a trinitarian concept see look what brother R then had to do now I'm going to quote this about a brother that that I won't call his name but a lot of you would know it but he had said something to brother brandham according to what he said he had said something to brother brandham about Malachi 4 and he said you you're Malachi 4 he said you can't tell it he said you can't tell it he forbid the man to tell of what he saw about him as Malachi 4 why but my Lord he had trouble like it was trying his best to get along with organized religions and fellowship with them and associate with them and what was he doing he realized he was just sewing seeds for a bride right amen you realize all of that other is just F along the way to be burned one day but he couldn't come out and declare what he was doing did he ever jump up and say you got to believe me now I'm the big guy no he always tried to Humble himself and recognize others as greater than he was but he was a special Porter like I said you may not thank anything whatsoever but that number seven guy he was special but he couldn't get the people totally free because you had to go by the grave even though it was the great Apostle Paul he could speak of the chains but he could not bring it forth right amen why why was it that he could not bring it forth because the Holy Ghost was bound but I don't like for you to say it like that brother Dale you look like you're saying at the Holy Ghost B I didn't say it your Prophet was the one that said it that's right and if you go home tonight and put on any tape in the 50s you'll see him ripping them Pentecostal to smithin because they denominated on his the the Pentecostal message that's right got into the seal book and he said they cabbage down on it cuz the Holy Ghost was never truly free yes but you'll never see the Holy Ghost is free what you're looking at then there'll never be a Rapture that's right I'm not backing up I state that and leave it alone he's either going to be free in a group of people and that's why the prophet would say a little group right you know right now there's probably over 5 million message Believers I don't mind saying it but I don't mind saying the rest of it either how many Christian Believers are there in the world they would be 5 million people that believe this message how many Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals and all of religious people are the in the world millions of millions of millions then 5 million would be a small group if you're not little flock it's still right if there's five million but what if you dropped it back like he says a lot of time what if you went back to the days of Noah eight people oh we don't like to quote a small group with when we quote from Brother brandom do we what did he say you need this one he said I'll doubt a dozen out of this generation making it to the chain you need that cuz remember Noah Ty the foolish virgins and things are the eight Enoch went up by himself you know right that's why he said maybe when I was state so you might as well move because I'm here Danny you going up Tennessee somewhere cuz I'm here there's only one out OFA State you say you're just making life no I'm not making life I'm doing what r r said a small number it don't have to be millions and millions to make it to fulfill his word may I quote brother random he said if he can get one man one man to believe the word right look what he done back there were one man right what if he could get one sister just to believe it oh yeah okay all right what now those ages denominated a little bride came down to there and she'll be there but that's what I like about the rest of the scripture when you come to the seventh age that we're living in you come to Hebrews 11:40 they without us cannot be made perfect we ain't gonna pull them up and preach nothing to them straighten them out no uhuh they're going to raise in Christ like way was bringing out Wednesday night or Sunday the dead in Christ that's an odd way of saying it dead in Christ but those who in Christ that are dead to themselves to walk in newness of Life am see when you're coming down then to the end and a matter of fact I had the title till way preached Wednesday I had the title of the of the end of all things and I had the scripture he gave in First Peter 4 okay that don't bother me I just move over and pick up another scripture and another title messenger at the end of the age but really talking about a porter a porter a messenger to show you what we've had the god called a release every seven years and that went in rotation then when you come down to the 49th that man's got a special message because he declares the Jubilee for the seven amen are you with me Paul declared a jubilee for the age right all right irus declared all each one of them but they never declared a 50 it wasn't there it was a 50 in the release of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul amen but it was not a release to take a body out of here but this messenger has a triple job first he starts out in his early Ministry just like Paul would you like some quotes from him when he went beyond the curtain of time what did he say he said will Paul's people be there he said yeah they'll be there he said and I preach just what Paul preached and he said all them people shout and Glory Hallelujah do you realize that a lot of them people he saw when he went beyond the curtain of time now listen were probably trinitarians who got born again in that day are you going to leave FF bosard out of it are you going to leave some of those Jewels out of it I wouldn't walk too much in that if I were you I would try to walk a little soft all right but what about a man that comes along then then when he comes to his time he's got to proclaim a seven-year release and by having a seven-year release there's going to be a certain limitations so you see the prophet he's trying his best to bring forth for the day and the time and the starting out he thought he preached the seals in 5 what 57 did he preach the seals went through him he thought he preached it right you know what he did cuz you know what until that top was whipped off and looked down in there nobody was responsible for that I don't care who says what nobody wasn't responsible for that he wasn't responsible have you ever noticed a statement that he used to make there made quite a bit he said you just say what I say he said and God will hold me responsible good could he have known something could he have known that he wasn't exactly lined up perfectly to the opening of the seals and the thing and yet he knew that his words were still right that the door had opened that he had been a porter to open the word way do we get there and find out the Holy Ghost it started on isusa street just come right on over into brother Brandon right brother R said he called another he said no messenger of the age he said because the Holy Ghost came himself he calls those Messengers on on restoration of rdrye he calls them prophets he calls Luther a prophet he calls Wesley a prophet amen no Messenger to the lady of seean age because the Holy Ghost came himself but remember what the rest that what we said at the end of the age is to come forth I'm just laying a foundation for that because I I just don't feel the drive hard I'm I'm I'm sorry I have to do as I am and forgive me but I'm trying to get you and I to see something and I I just stay with what brother he said hold up the point until he get it and then move on okay I may preach the same thing over and over and over and over and over but one of these days you'll say thank you for preaching that over and over and over I finally got it it finally struck home what has happened cuz I hope you can see what I'm talking about this messenger that fell in the end time that Holy Spirit that started on a zeusa street was bringing the word of God it had already brought truth of the Oneness oh no there all messed up not as messed up as us trying to ter was so don't Crow all right don't Crow you might always stay quiet you say well they just all messed up in Oneness you better talk to God about it because according to your Prophet they were the move of God for the time zeusa Street 1906 was trinitarians you started about 1911 12 right in there and you started with the Oneness Doctrine and listen folks this may blow your little bubble a little bit but all right brother Brandon wasn't the first one who come forth baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know that you go back and read little history they were already baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before brother ROM come along check your profit andc see you had people that were preaching a lot of truth but none of them could be the messenger so the mankind had to wait so if you understand what I'm saying in the 49th year really you're starting the 48th which would start brother randam at the early part of his ministry and it moves upward it moves upward he enters that seven and he begins to see the message and the opening of the word and seeing those things as it unfold I ask you to check things about it but you how many of you went home and took your your pad down and just read the titles let me ask you a simple question brother brandom in 1957 over and over under thus sayeth the Lord said that MDC was almighty God when the seals broke he preached the message who is this male chesd he'd always preached that Jesus was almighty God and not a second person or third person not even the first person he said he's the de person himself well why did he preach the message over called Christ is the mystery of God revealed and you better remember what he done in that you better remember and who is this m jezdic he took you right back to seeing who mzd was but he brought you to see who mdic is in your own experience right who is this m Christ is the mystery of God reveal what did he bring it I thought he brought a three-fold revelation in that I thought he brought all God was he puted into CH all Christ into the church Church making her part of the mystery making her part of the Revelation and she's got to be revealed that's all I've ever tried to preach is the revealing of the Bride of Jesus Christ because that's what your Prophet come to do how many more do you need of just seeing what he done from that age to this age to this age to this time until God opened that word and just kept opening that word and kept opening the word preached in 1958 serpent seed right he said serpent seed was revealed in the seals are you following me this last day messenger had a special thing cuz he had to declare this release to come under the church age of the seven but then he's got to come at the end of the age to bring his message to declare eternal life about a message what about a man that walked in that realm church I tremble at a little bit that God has revealed to me because there's power in the word and there's power to mislead right there's power into deceiving you so yeah but brother Dale we can't do that just don't ever say you can't do it right just don't ever say that you're a match for the devil un quotes your prophet he said no man is a match for the devil now let's quote the rest of that because we don't leave you on Earth but he said the Holy Ghost in any individual is a match for the devil now then are are we right the Holy Ghost and an individual as a match for the devil thinking about that scripture today all things are possible what to the prophet or to the Lord Jesus Bible doesn't say that says to them that believe but yet do we believe that church I'm just trying to get you to see something and see where you're at and where you're you got got to be called up we've got to move as the messenger moved that's where I know that that people hasn't understood me gropping back into the to the 60s and coming into the 70s that they didn't understand the approach that I was trying to make but it's simply what I'm saying now we give all the honor and glory to the messenger of the hour that brought the message but the messenger of the hour is not The Shepherd of the sheepo the messenger of the hour I'm talking about the porter the guy to bring the message but he stands in a special place is that man back there if you follow me want to do it when it comes to about the 48th year he knows next year there's a Sevenfold and he's got to Proclaim that Liberty but then he looks and he says wait a minute we've already had six we're standing in the 7th the next has got to be a golden jubilee for the 50 and he starts looking at it he starts declaring it proclaiming it you remember Sunday proclaiming announcing it stating it telling it that a jubilee freedom is coming that will have no limitations to it that Christ can come and live in his people the way he always wanted to right you think he wasn't happy with Paul and all of those Brothers on the great Revelation they were trying to bring but you think he wasn't happy with the the great John that stood there proclaiming the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but the Bible says the least in the kingdom is greater than John the Bible says no man born of a woman who was great as John then he see when the riter catches he fall he puts it in he said but the least in the Kingdom you realize where we're standing we're standing on the threshold of Eternity well sure don't look like it that's what the scripture says will happen people say that we've heard it from the beginning you know that's the greatest sign that is here is when you say you've heard it from the beginning and you don't believe it that's what the Bible says read your Bible That's the greatest sign what somebody to come and say oh we've heard that from the beginning what you want to do shake the person's hand and say you know you're in the Bible right you're right in the middle of the Bible just wrong place but you're in the Bible but listen church we talked about Sunday that the prophet of God said what that we the bride has got to be called out of the age by the word of God he said this is not a Pentecostal age you remember all of those do we think we're still in Pentecost no well I'm Pentecost top of my head bottom of my feet all right praise the Lord is it true Pentecost you know what if it is true Pentecost you don't have to holler and Shout about it right it ain't cause you shouting and screaming and hollering right you remember what I gave you you want me to bring that quote to you where brother Brandon said the true Pentecostals was them back there in the old in the people people that killed Jesus Christ cuz they were shouting Glory Hallelujah and crying and praying while they were killing him he said how can he make them Pentecostal because Pentecostal is not Pentecost there's a lot of difference in Pentecostal and Pentecostalism and through Pentecost Pentecost is 50 Pentecostalism is denominationalism H I just asked a simple question has the Holy Ghost been set free what's your answer to that when your Prophet said it happened well he just see there now you're going to doubt the prophet's message that's what I'm telling you I'm sorry I'm sorry folks for the way I preach cuz I preach a one straight thing I'm only have one line and it's straight I may be as crooked as a dog's on leg on everything else but when I talk about this word I got one line one straight thing and that's his word is right he said the the this is the bride age you remember that Sunday bride age we gave it over and over and over this is the bride age a message was to come forth were to call us out because every bride has been called out of the age into Christ Paul was called out of the age into Christ now let me just do do you want to read those over again where brother around talking about that the bride is called out of this age do you need us to read them over again or do you believe what I tried to preach Sunday that this is the bride age and ever age was a bride called out of the age into Christ until John in this age and I mean showing from back there coming here was actually taken out of here up into heaven we're supposed to be in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in a bright age called there by the messenger of Malachi 4 open the door to us the porter standing in the door opening that door to where that we can see Jesus Christ and call us out of the age the new birth pulls the soul out of the age right because it's eternal life but he doesn't pull the body out but the we gave the scripture in Hebrew that he suffered without the gate we got to go out to him come on Pentecostalism denominationalism lady oan I gave you the quote Sunday where they what they put him out and crucified him you see you and I have got to walk into the word of the hour and believe it well brother D I believe everybody I can well praise God but let's don't quit just because we think we got it we're cavage down on it you certainly know for one thing for sure that I've not quit preaching and I've been preaching this message just like this for 40 years trying to get you and me to see it did you see Jesus Christ first sermon I preached in 1969 was that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the word made flesh in the end time boy you talking about some looking at ain't quite as bad tonight but that they sure did look at me then and I kept saying over and over brother brandham is not the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man brother R was a son of man we're not talking about becoming a son of man because we're not prophets but we as a bride of Jesus Christ becoming the children of God turn out to be the word made flesh and the Earth the son of man in the end time I taught that from the beginning I'm still teaching it but when are we going to believe it when are we going to accept it we're not into Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age is out there we're not in the ladyo AG it's out there by the new birth we already in Christ but we're supposed to be called out where he's at out of our own ideas and thoughts into Christ which is the word and to see him living among us to see him living in the word we were talking about their Sunday I had to just back up from it cuz you know what I'm talking about when I got on to that Sunday where the brother brand said the greatest anointing believe it was Sunday or the Wednesday before the greatest anointing in the world was the Lord Jesus Christ when he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me he turned around he read the scripture handed it back to the priest and turned around and said I am and said this day this scripture is full of nobody shouting nobody hollering nobody doing nothing you remember when brother R got over the seal book he said I've seen the dead raised he said I've seen the sick heal he said I've seen marvelous things great things to happen he said but I've never worked in the realm that I'm working now he said this is the bringing of the word by The Same Spirit but yet we want to shout and Glory Hallelujah I believe in it too I believe in it too but I just don't put it first I put Christ first and then the rest of it falls in line to where that it can be that and see then we're called into the bright age out of denominationalism and if we ain't called out of that we're still in the lady OA I think we are brother de well then you need to be bed out of the age into this message I didn't say that your prophets once said it now you see you holler at me all the time I'm just telling you what he said I thought the prophet said she's to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 what's he talking about what does adoption bring you to when you're born again here your soul is totally out of the age and you're just climbing higher the age should get less important what about it what about that Porter as he stands there and he declares his message may I quote him this way have you ever notied in spoken words Original Seed it's also in the church age book but in spoken word Original Seed that brother brandham brings his message down through message one all the way lay laying it down to the word and the hour that we're living right and how Christ is here and what all is taking place and all at once he stops he said but but as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled go home and get your spoken word book and look it up you don't find it be sure and holler at me 12:00 tonight I'll find it for you stay up all night why because I've been quoting it all the time that's what he said he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled that was 1962 well you know what the prophet just quit and went on back and decided that no he just kept right on going didn't he why because he knew that if God told him Malachi 4 hadn't been fulfilled yet that it meant it was going to be fulfilled and he believed he just might have something to do with it so he just kept on preaching and you know what ain't it kind of odd God come on the scene and he had something to do with him cuz he was a porter the one who opened the door his message is not him I got more sense than that but what about it I don't have enough time to get into bringing it all the way down but I do want to you to do one thing we made a little drawing years ago and drawings are good and kind of like a brother he he he brought me a drawing one time and and he he laid it down and he said how do you like that he said look at that beautiful said this brother draw this and made a beautiful drawing said isn't it beautiful said it's lined up said he's got these things here and he's got this here and I said brother I'm sorry but he ain't right where I said right here he's got this is supposed to be over here in the tribulation and he's got it over here with us and us over there and all kind of things he you know what he said he said was it a pretty drawing I said pretty drawing but it's pretty wrong pretty wrong now I want to just give you this and I gave you a copy of it a lot of you still got them for years ago we've been preaching this for years and we ain't got no trouble with it just bring up the picture we we got together and concluded this over the years of trying to bring something but we're just talking about that Porter for a minute and all we going to talk about how he comes at the end of the age amen and then Sunday we'll pick it back up and go on well he come to the end of the age well now what age did Paul come to the end of did he come at the end of Ephesus well then how did he bring the message to Ephesus well they come to age said they come in the age amen but did Paul come at the end of Ephesus if he did how'd he bring his message to Ephesus okay so now look we know that there was a great happening of God and a great move of God called Pentecost amen but the Holy Ghost failed on Pentecost and for 20 30 years or something I I don't know exactly because it ain't worried about it but that Holy Ghost was doing Mighty wonderful things among those in the book of Acts and bringing it forth but then here comes the Apostle Paul Paul said one born out of you see Reon you people you know R around said that same thing talking to the Pentecostal Right Here Comes Paul here's Ephesus did Paul come over here at the end of Ephesus now I want you to look at one other thing because like I said anytime I preach something if I was you I would follow it real close because I try to progress and not not back up I try to always add something to it to make you interested this black represents the darkness right the light represents the bride that true the light almost goes out down in the Dark Ages then comes back and it puts up a little another and the last age goes into total darkness am I right you need this quote brother R said I left a little light because it goes into total darkness but he said I left a little light I think you'd listen to that Porter just a little bit he might be able to introduce Christ to us if we'd listen so Paul didn't come at the end of the age he come to the end of Pentecost because Pentecost LIC it up until Paul coming on the scene now listen I know my story Peter opens the door to the Gentiles right am I right now Peter opens the door Peter was not the messenger to the Gentiles no way and remember these Church ages is Gentile that's right this whole church ages is Gentile that's right amen not Jewish now Jewish people back here but it already turned into the Gentile dispensation it turned into the D Gentile dispensation when Paul come forth as the messenger and do you need Scripture cuz he said he said i' I'm I'm the man to the Pentecost I'm I'm the man to come to bring it to these Gentiles he said I didn't want to didn't want how to undo it he said God chose me God told one of the men to go over there and tell him open his eyes and said tell him what he's going to take what he's going to do and you look at the life of the Apostle Paul Not only was he fought by the enemy around he was fought by the church cuz they were the ones trying to kill him not just the Jews of the Old Testament Peter argued with him and he backed up he said we might have argued but said Paul says things hard to be understood we better leave him alone right am I in the scripture come look so where does your Porter fall remember he's got to open the door to the church age Paul opened the door to Ephesus was he the messenger to Ephesus that's all I'm asking if that ought to be enough sensible was he the messenger to Ephesus brother R said he was that's right so solves that do we need the church ages and go back through them that's what I said This is 40 something years you know look where Paul stood we'll get to it Sunday the messenger always rebukes the previous age for getting away from God and brings his message the porter look where he's at he in between the ages now let me let me say this is the word added okay all right listen are you with me this is the word added where was this church at well it's right here it's dra out right where was it that you ain't listen to what I've been preaching I thought we was to go out to where he was at I thought this church went out where Paul was at oh no Paul's in here come on they say I make funny faces around here I make funny faces and keep from screaming to death and crying to think of the carnality of man's mind how many times have you read it where brother Brown said the messenger come to the end of the age and you always put Paul at the end of Ephesus on the internet system if you're out there is not that the way you say Paul come right here at the end of Ephesus but he knew went the messenger to Ephesus and you're totally mathematically wrong and you're missing the whole message that's right go look this bride is called out to where this Porter is at that just ties that together as one Loop come on don't think it's just trying to explain something and look when you get over here and brother Ram said there was no Messenger to lady oia that Porter was the Holy Ghost and look where elah Falls in at the end of the age right Elijah didn't fall here at the beginning of the age he falls at the end of the age because he's going to introduce eternity we'll pick that up Sunday don't have time take this home whe and just look it over you said well I just can't fit it because I see the end of the ages business where you're at we'll read where brother randam says these and tells you where each age messenger is and how they come at the end of the previous age and they bring their message that takes off into the that age that he's to bring it if you bring Paul at the end of Ephesus you have no message what's the rest of Ephesus if you got him coming to end of Pentecost that's where he was that's right cuz he rebuked the Pentecostals right now did Paul not rebuke just he didn't rebuke this a don't nominal Jew he rebuked them people for getting away from Jesus's message and he started a church age cuz you don't have no church ages until you come into Gentile dispensation and Gentile dispensation means you got to have a start and I hope you'll follow this and Wade will be Sunday afternoon following it up so that's fine with me I hope you follow it this way if you'll look at that drawing that's in front of you you got seven men named as Church age Messengers but you've got eight manifestations of God you're perfect mathematically to where this messenger can declare eternal life Body Spirit Soul world everything he can Proclaim it and his message has done that what a beautiful time and an hour that we're living well I saw this brother Dale 40 years ago praise God so did I and I've had the hardest time in my life trying to explain it to the people of this message brother brandom I didn't say it brother R said there was no Messenger to Lady AIA on zeusa street he said because the Holy Ghost came himself said then after not all the rest of the ages he said in the messenger sent the end of the age now listen I know to that you cannot put dates and times in those Church ages some of them were dead before they even started the message was proclaimed a stark right come on we've been around long enough to read but you're not getting the point the point is the message to the age the point that brother brandom emphasized was what what did he emphasize about the porter the one that was the closest to the original truth is the way the Holy Spirit picked the church AE Messengers he didn't say he picked them the Holy Spirit picked come on musicians think on these things a porter and Jesus declaring there and says the porter opened the door and it was his voice not listen it was not the Porter's voice listen read your scripture over we'll read it again it wasn't a Porter's voice that called the people out it was the voice of Jesus Christ he just opened the door the voice of Jesus Christ is what called him out said they come out and they followed and went forth what about it what about it let's Stand Together what about a great time that we can follow this message all the way to the end and put it right back in the Old Testament in the scriptures and declare it to be still the porters guarding the temple that was their job they face north south east and west looked over the city you can get it so close if you'll read it you get so close until it looks like the Porter is the one who does it but then you got to go back to the Watchman what of the night when it went out into the city you picked up from the Porter and your Watchman started and he went away read your Bible it's all I ask you to do those Porters had a special place look at all the things that they were to handle what about God putting it to where that he put it right down in where the son of man coming on the scene and he says the porter open the door then I call my children my sheep and they go forward hearing my voice there another voice they won't hear now this is what I like see there's got to be somewhere in our lives of you and I all together there was a time that brother brandham became so personal with what he was saying until it was the very person of God speaking through him you believe that uh want you go back there in the Old Testament and pick it up a little bit and see how that that Thomas David would say what he did and see how Solomon would say what he did and how they declare they pierced my hands and my feet speaking in the very person of God getting very close is it we just know not to cross the line that's a Razor's Edge the prophet would call it just don't fall on the wrong side the razor and you keep Jesus Christ to be right what we got brother 58 red book 58 red book anybody have a need I'll try to pick this up Sunday and bring it on to the messenger coming at the End of the Age cuz there's a lot there to be understood s there are
