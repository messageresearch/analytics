[0:34] Sunday school class we'll have on it and
[0:36] I hope everybody understands
[0:39] that he speaks of redemption
[0:42] bottom line shows the whole Redemption
[0:45] of man through Jesus Christ all right
[0:52] Joe 14
[0:56] let's just read the whole let's get the
[0:58] whole whole point let's read the whole
[1:00] chapter
[1:02] is that all right
[1:03] read the whole chapter
[1:06] Job chapter 14.
[1:09] I'm gonna go ahead and shut the door
[1:10] again
[1:12] foreign
[1:26] last weekend but he was here Wednesday
[1:28] night
[1:30] but that's okay this is the class here
[1:32] we need to worry about chapter 14. man
[1:35] that is born of a woman is a few days
[1:37] and full of trouble
[1:45] that's men and women man
[1:50] yeah I feel better right hold his head
[1:54] I told Kathy you ought to talk to
[1:57] Raymore this morning and raise it don't
[1:59] care know what I think
[2:02] I'm fine
[2:10] they're a cute couple yeah that's right
[2:13] he coming forward like a flower and it's
[2:15] cut down he flips also as a shadow and
[2:18] continues not
[2:19] and does thou open Thine Eyes Upon such
[2:21] in one brings me into judgment with thee
[2:24] question
[2:25] who can bring a clean thing out of an
[2:27] unclean thing not one Joe got a
[2:30] revelation that he needed a redeemer
[2:31] that was not born like he was born
[2:34] all right so and that's what we're
[2:35] seeing in Revelation 5
[2:38] we're seeing a lamb a bloody lamb
[2:40] somebody that could take that book
[2:42] there was no human
[2:44] see John could take just what job was
[2:47] saying there was no human none good no
[2:49] not one
[2:50] remember John was weeping because he
[2:52] couldn't find anybody that was worthy
[2:53] who can bring a clean thing out of an
[2:56] unclean thing not one that's why Jesus
[2:58] had to come through the womb of a woman
[3:01] to clean it up
[3:03] make it right he didn't make it right
[3:06] and we started becoming spiritually born
[3:08] though he had to come through to say hey
[3:10] this is what I've got to do to clean
[3:13] this whole mess up because that's where
[3:15] it started and then
[3:17] of course we understand that it started
[3:19] in Mary's mind first and it started in
[3:21] Eve's mind first and then the conception
[3:24] happen through the body all right seeing
[3:27] his days are determined the number of
[3:29] his months are with thee thou has
[3:32] appointed his bounds that he cannot pass
[3:35] in other words when it's your time to go
[3:36] God knows it's your time to go and
[3:38] you're going to go all right
[3:40] turn from him that he may rest till he
[3:43] shall accomplish as in hiring his day
[3:46] for there is hope of a tree
[3:50] if it be cut down that it will Sprout
[3:52] again and that the tender Branch thereof
[3:54] will not cease so what's job doing he's
[3:56] looking at a tree they cut it down he
[3:58] said well it's dead no next spring Here
[4:01] Comes life right out of that tree again
[4:03] but he sees man go down
[4:05] and man does not appear again all right
[4:08] foreign
[4:10] though the root thereof wax old in the
[4:13] earth and the stop thereof die in the
[4:14] ground yet through the scent of water it
[4:17] will bud and bring forth vowels like a
[4:19] plant
[4:20] but man dies and wasted the way yeah man
[4:23] give us up The Ghost and where is he
[4:27] as the water fell from the sea
[4:30] to flood of the chaos and drives up so
[4:32] man life down and Rises not till the
[4:35] heavens be no more they shall not awake
[4:37] nor be raised out of their sleep right
[4:40] hey
[4:42] hold it now wouldn't hide me in the
[4:44] grave
[4:45] and that's what God's doing
[4:48] he's hiding the people
[4:50] in the grave
[4:52] like we were talking about last night
[4:53] about killing and stuff about you know
[4:55] killing little children and all that
[4:57] god did did those amalachite babies a
[5:00] favor by killing them when they were
[5:01] young
[5:02] so they could go to heaven so he's
[5:04] hiding them away in the grave
[5:08] that now what is keep me secret until
[5:10] thy wrath be passed in other words all
[5:13] this is going on
[5:15] that's why we don't you know disclude
[5:17] people that are that are gone on my
[5:20] they're they're resting in a place much
[5:22] better than this
[5:24] that thou would have keep me secret
[5:26] until I wrath be passed that now what is
[5:28] to point me a set time and remember me
[5:32] always
[5:37] when I when I have a friend pass away I
[5:40] said Lord remember them
[5:42] I said if you remember me if you're
[5:44] going to remember me as a bride then
[5:45] you'll have to remember them okay
[5:47] because remember we're able to impart
[5:49] eternal life to people
[5:51] I have to watch on judgment
[5:53] if a man dies shall he live again that's
[5:55] a question
[5:56] all the days of my appointed time well I
[5:59] wait till my change come
[6:04] then what did he say in my flesh I shall
[6:06] see God
[6:07] so he has to invert that's in chapter of
[6:09] what 16 or 17 or 19.
[6:12] see so job is keeping his thought
[6:14] together about this man Thou shalt call
[6:18] and I will answer thee
[6:20] thou will have a desire to the work of
[6:22] thine hands for now thou numberest my
[6:25] steps
[6:26] thus thou not watch over my sin
[6:31] now here's the one we're going to start
[6:34] with right here and head into the first
[6:36] seal
[6:38] my transgression is sealed up in a bag
[6:44] and thou soweth up
[6:47] my iniquity
[6:52] my transgression is sealed up in a bag
[6:55] and thou sowing stuff
[6:58] my iniquity
[7:02] how about that
[7:05] because we're going to look in the first
[7:07] seal
[7:08] and we're going to see the mystery of
[7:10] iniquity
[7:11] it's going to have to be
[7:13] done away with us now job is prophesying
[7:18] of a change
[7:20] I'll rest in the grave in other words
[7:21] till my chains comes
[7:24] because remember when God first the
[7:26] ground and for reading Corinthians just
[7:29] for a point let's read Corinthians
[7:36] 15
[7:39] first sorry First Corinthians
[7:43] 15. daddy read it last week
[7:49] verse 42 answers the whole question
[7:54] so also is the resurrection of the Dead
[7:57] it is sown in corruption
[7:59] your body came out of this Earth that
[8:01] was cursed from the Garden of Eden so
[8:03] there's only one way for you to get it
[8:05] back is
[8:07] is for you either to be changed or go by
[8:09] the grave go down under the crust of the
[8:12] earth everybody understand that in other
[8:14] words
[8:16] Donna You Gotta Die to be Resurrected
[8:19] you can't resurrect and be alive
[8:22] you got to be dead that's spiritually
[8:25] and so as naturally all right now let's
[8:28] not talk about to change the body right
[8:30] now let's just talk about the people
[8:31] that have gone on
[8:32] they couldn't come to this Revelations 5
[8:34] and Revelation 6 Revelation that we have
[8:37] in this day to where we can walk out of
[8:39] here without seeing death
[8:41] all right because the resurrection
[8:43] message has to be preached by a live
[8:45] group of people right all right which is
[8:48] Jesus Christ he said I died one time and
[8:51] I'm Alive Now forevermore
[8:53] all power in Heaven and Earth has been
[8:55] given unto me a flesh Man Standing on
[8:57] the Earth
[8:58] called Jesus Christ and guess what you
[9:00] and I were in him when he said those
[9:03] words in spiritual multiplication into
[9:06] Genesis 1 26 that he was but that
[9:09] Genesis one man had already come out and
[9:11] overcome
[9:13] that 2-7 man
[9:17] that Mary produced
[9:19] everybody understand that Mary Mary
[9:21] didn't produce the body we know that but
[9:22] it come out of America
[9:24] all right which was what Earth
[9:27] okay so that man that man that was
[9:29] standing there in Earth said all powers
[9:32] have a nurse been given unto me
[9:34] so that's the way you and I have to see
[9:35] it but look around here this is so all
[9:37] sorts of resurrection of the dead it is
[9:39] sown in corruption now what do you do
[9:40] when you sow something
[9:42] not s-e-w that's this kind of stuff when
[9:45] you s-o-w-n you go outside tomorrow and
[9:49] you plant something
[9:51] you have shown it what into the ground
[9:53] and done what with it you've covered it
[9:55] up
[9:56] it was sown in corruption
[9:59] when we go and bury somebody we're
[10:01] planting them back into the ground
[10:05] and then what's going to happen
[10:07] that tree is going to come back up right
[10:10] see so Joe went far off job just didn't
[10:12] have a complete revelation of what was
[10:14] going on he said I see the tree and it
[10:16] comes back up I see the man
[10:18] let's see job was not the one to see the
[10:21] physical Resurrection but when we plant
[10:23] people in the ground we have to plant
[10:25] those into the ground
[10:27] I wrote in my Bible planted sown in
[10:29] corruption
[10:30] but see when it comes back up
[10:34] it's never going to go down again
[10:36] it's what it's Stone and Corruption
[10:39] raised in in corruption in other words
[10:43] it's some moral
[10:46] we put a mortal body into the ground
[10:48] we'll never see
[10:51] sister Hazel's mortal body again
[10:55] mortal
[10:57] it will be immortal
[10:59] okay now you said once I got to do
[11:02] Revelations five that is the culmination
[11:04] of redemption that's right
[11:06] redeem means to what bring back
[11:09] to its original condition the original
[11:12] condition was
[11:13] no sin in the garden well job right here
[11:16] is telling us he said you have took my
[11:18] sin
[11:20] put it away and even my iniquity you're
[11:23] doing away with it
[11:25] now that's what's happening when we're
[11:27] going to start into the seal
[11:29] when we go into in my flesh I shall see
[11:31] God when we start in the first seal
[11:33] there is the mystery of iniquity
[11:36] that you and I have to contend with
[11:38] every day of our life
[11:41] so don't tell me you don't do things
[11:43] wrong and you know you shouldn't do them
[11:45] that's iniquity
[11:47] but now you've got to realize one thing
[11:52] watch let's read
[11:54] I saw it last night in the Bible study
[11:56] and I'm going to read it this morning
[11:57] it's in uh
[12:00] it's in Corinthians somewhere
[12:04] we're going to go this way because
[12:06] that's just the way I feel to go one
[12:11] one in six First Corinthians chapter six
[12:14] First Corinthians chapter 6.
[12:20] because this is what we've got to get
[12:22] over when we start into this you got to
[12:24] realize one thing we were all born in
[12:26] sand
[12:27] shaping in iniquity spouse from my
[12:31] mother's womb a liar okay and on our way
[12:35] to Hell lost Dune
[12:38] finish as far as
[12:40] human beings are concerned right okay
[12:45] now look what Paul said in First
[12:46] Corinthians 6 verse 9. now where is he
[12:48] at he's at the congregation of the
[12:50] Corinthians they're Christians but they
[12:53] have problems
[12:55] no you're not verse 9. let the
[12:58] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[12:59] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[13:03] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[13:06] these are getting pretty good these
[13:08] pretty bad people
[13:12] effeminate
[13:14] abusers of themselves with mankind
[13:19] nor thieves narcovetous nor drunkards
[13:23] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[13:25] inherit the kingdom of God
[13:27] if he would have stopped right there we
[13:29] would have never had hope
[13:31] of making it
[13:33] verse 11.
[13:35] and such were some of you
[13:39] I was one of that group
[13:43] but you're washed
[13:46] that ye are sanctified
[13:49] but ye are justified in the name of the
[13:51] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[13:55] that gives us all a chance
[13:58] even though the ones that go by the
[14:00] great that gives them a chance
[14:03] so Paul was saying hey
[14:05] now that doesn't mean you can get up and
[14:07] do all these things right here over and
[14:09] over again
[14:11] yeah I believe he come to that
[14:12] Corinthian Church found that they were
[14:14] still babes
[14:16] still doing you know leaning a little
[14:18] bit to the flesh
[14:20] but I believe that church
[14:22] straightened up
[14:25] that church straightened up because
[14:26] remember the man that was living with
[14:27] his mother-in-law right yeah
[14:31] Paul rebuked that but he didn't throw a
[14:33] man out of church and like Daddy said a
[14:36] little bit later on brother Adam said
[14:37] he'd become a deacon in church pretty
[14:39] hard to understand
[14:42] there's Grace but there's not greasy
[14:43] Grace right
[14:47] you can do a lot of things that'll take
[14:49] you out of a position but he can't take
[14:51] you out of Christianity that's what I
[14:52] want you to understand
[14:53] even in these seals if you can't see all
[14:56] the seals and I can't see them all like
[14:57] I should if you can't see what's in
[14:59] these seals
[15:01] then then you know what that don't make
[15:03] you not a Christian right right
[15:05] that does not make you an unbeliever
[15:08] okay believe what you know brother
[15:10] Brown's even said in in the book in in
[15:13] questions and answers he's like go on
[15:15] with the same simple life be a Christian
[15:17] do your job work and raise a family be a
[15:22] man of the community a woman of the
[15:24] community but there's somebody there's
[15:26] going to be a group of people that's
[15:28] gonna that's gonna This is Gonna Break
[15:30] Forth on them and they cannot die
[15:35] amen and like Danny said last night he's
[15:38] in this age
[15:40] it's in this generation
[15:42] the one I'm looking at now right may not
[15:45] be mine may not be yours but it may be
[15:47] these children right right
[15:48] somebody's going to raise up and say I
[15:51] see what God has been talking about
[15:53] since the beginning of time
[15:57] and even in my flesh
[16:00] I shall see God because see job had to
[16:03] go through this journey
[16:04] I know my redeemer liveth and at the
[16:07] last days
[16:09] I don't see my redeemer
[16:12] all right in the last days this means
[16:15] after he's dead he's got to raise back
[16:17] up but see I hope you caught this last
[16:19] Sunday I didn't say it but I'm going to
[16:21] say it this Sunday
[16:22] in my flesh I shall see God
[16:33] right
[16:37] yeah I'm hoping you see that last Sunday
[16:38] and if you didn't that's okay but that's
[16:41] that's why we preachers save a little
[16:42] bit we don't shoot all our ammunition at
[16:45] one time we'll save a little bit for
[16:47] later
[16:48] but in my flesh I shall see God that's
[16:51] what job said knowing that he was going
[16:53] to die
[16:54] and be resurrected back again but
[16:56] there's a group of people standing in
[16:58] the end time that says in my flesh I
[17:00] shall see God without death
[17:02] in this place right here
[17:05] we're going to see God
[17:08] manifested
[17:10] in human flesh right not to see God as
[17:13] Jesus walking no
[17:15] right here
[17:17] I've listened to a song this morning
[17:19] that uh June had on the radio about the
[17:22] LaFontaine Family
[17:25] and it really struck me
[17:28] and we say that we're the final voice
[17:30] for the final age
[17:32] you ever thought about that
[17:34] final means there's no more
[17:37] yeah
[17:37] right final means there's no more
[17:41] and voice means one voice coming from
[17:45] one group of people
[17:48] God has entrusted all of past and
[17:53] Eternity
[17:54] on this bride right here right
[17:57] because there's no other voice
[17:59] denominations don't have a voice
[18:02] they have been cut off remember
[18:05] God's only going to hear one group of
[18:07] people in this end time and that's the
[18:10] people of the Bride that Jesus Christ
[18:11] right and not just the Believers of this
[18:13] message
[18:14] but you gotta believe this message to be
[18:16] able to take body change that's right
[18:18] you've got to believe this man you've
[18:20] got to have this message bred inside of
[18:22] you and you got to get rid of all the
[18:25] junk that we're doing and and you know
[18:28] we just need a house cleaning
[18:30] you know June and I've been going
[18:31] through today Ramsey Financial thing
[18:33] when we finished Friday night and we
[18:35] paid off a lot of debt
[18:36] we just have stuff laying around we
[18:39] clean house
[18:40] we got to clean a little more house
[18:42] but we didn't get an inheritance to pay
[18:45] off ten thousand dollars in debt and you
[18:46] know or a little less than ten thousand
[18:48] in six months we just had stuff laying
[18:51] around with it we sold
[18:52] that we got rid of
[18:54] it was a house clean we're not finished
[18:56] no it won't be six months you're right
[18:59] we just had this stuff
[19:01] well you know what that's the same thing
[19:02] with with the scripture we got stuff
[19:07] remember the old saying that the devil
[19:09] you know the devil had a meeting or
[19:11] meeting where he was at and he said hey
[19:13] these Christians are getting too
[19:14] christianized I'm gonna give them
[19:15] magazines and then I'm gonna give them
[19:17] movies and then I'm gonna give them
[19:19] television we'll come on down and I'm
[19:20] gonna give you the internet now you know
[19:22] how much time do we spend on the
[19:23] internet every week
[19:25] oh my God
[19:27] I know at work I spent about four hours
[19:29] on that thing just reading emails
[19:32] people can't talk to people anymore
[19:34] right but that takes up your time you
[19:37] gotta it physically puts you in front of
[19:39] something
[19:40] that you gotta read it
[19:44] but we can't get away from that right
[19:46] and listen God knew that
[19:49] this didn't surprise him when the
[19:51] computers came up or all these things
[19:53] you know and and you know God forgive me
[19:55] but all these people sitting around with
[19:57] these cell phones
[19:59] and the world's just going right on by
[20:01] you
[20:02] I've got one I've got an iPhone it's got
[20:05] all that junk on it just because the
[20:06] company makes me have it you know what
[20:07] it's happened today sitting in my house
[20:11] and if I if dings I'll pick it up and
[20:13] look at it but don't it's nothing
[20:16] we can't get caught up in this world
[20:19] you think this is away from far away
[20:21] from the seals it's not
[20:23] because the seals redeems this body and
[20:26] this body
[20:28] is the mo is motivated by what's inside
[20:30] of you and if what's inside of you does
[20:32] these things that we're going to talk
[20:34] about
[20:35] then you need to look at the motivator
[20:39] and I know we have jobs and I know we're
[20:40] connected
[20:43] but
[20:44] we should make it a lot better instead
[20:47] of setting out and I you know here I go
[20:49] again Facebook and all that stuff it's a
[20:51] waste of time
[20:52] it's a waste of time amen it's gossip
[20:57] don't tell me it's not it's gossip who's
[21:00] doing this who's pictures on the
[21:01] internet who's doing it that's taking
[21:03] your time away from God God don't care
[21:06] one thing about that junk and neither do
[21:08] I I wouldn't have one if they give it to
[21:11] me and told me they'd give me a million
[21:12] dollars I'd say and honestly I'm in
[21:14] church
[21:15] give me a million dollars to open a
[21:16] Facebook account I tell them forget it
[21:18] would not do it it's just junk it's
[21:20] gossip it's messy just gossip
[21:23] read this right here
[21:25] we got to get back to the basic right
[21:28] brother Brown comes up to the almost to
[21:30] the seventh seal and he's telling the
[21:31] people you've got to live a Christian
[21:33] Life right right we'll read it later
[21:36] you've got to live a good balanced
[21:38] Christian Life
[21:40] and see a balanced Christian Life is be
[21:43] with family be with friends
[21:45] talk to them don't become a hermit
[21:48] you know don't don't just crawl in a
[21:50] cave no God don't want them remember
[21:52] brother random wanted to do that he said
[21:54] Don I want to get in a cave and then
[21:55] jump out you know go out and do like a
[21:58] prophet God told him no
[22:01] he was a born-again Believer he wasn't
[22:03] like Amos and all those that were not
[22:05] born again that just went out there and
[22:07] condemned the people no that Prophet
[22:09] brought Grace so he had to live among
[22:10] his people to give the grace he had to
[22:13] be there with him he couldn't just stomp
[22:15] out and do things like that he had to
[22:17] become a pastor to the world the teacher
[22:19] to the world and the bangs was to the
[22:21] world that's what he was because he
[22:22] fulfilled all those five that we were
[22:24] talking about in the Bible Study last
[22:25] night
[22:26] but when we get started in this excuse
[22:29] me
[22:30] remember iniquity is something that you
[22:32] do that you know you shouldn't do yet
[22:35] you do it anyway that's right
[22:37] or something you should do
[22:40] and you don't do it that's right
[22:43] it's worth both ways
[22:46] what is that a balance
[22:48] that's what I said before you know June
[22:50] and I took that Dave Ramsey class it
[22:52] didn't take away anything of you know
[22:53] two hours a week we sat there everybody
[22:56] ought to have a solid Financial
[22:59] Foundation
[23:01] because God told us many times what to
[23:03] do with our money
[23:04] pay time save and a cheerful giver
[23:09] and then one in Proverbs says the the
[23:13] borrower is a slave to the lender
[23:17] and that's exactly the truth right it is
[23:20] that's why we're getting out of that
[23:21] fast as we can
[23:23] and you know I thank God that I had
[23:25] parents and even intentionally so
[23:26] they've been on a dead long time you
[23:27] know and you know what it makes a
[23:29] difference in your life it really does
[23:32] but let's get back on the subject but
[23:34] this is still this is still look when we
[23:36] go home
[23:38] every day when we go home or from church
[23:40] we go home it's the same stuff the
[23:42] devil's gonna start throwing at you
[23:45] all right
[23:46] and you know what watch the definition
[23:48] of of
[23:51] crazy are are being you know awesome is
[23:55] that you're going to do the same thing
[23:56] and get a different result
[23:59] see that's what that's what we learned
[24:01] in the class if you keep doing the same
[24:03] things you used to you're going to get
[24:05] the same result so change what you're
[24:07] doing you may get a different result
[24:10] you know I ask a lot of you to read in
[24:12] the Bible and read the you know read
[24:13] parts of the book how many of us do it
[24:16] how many of us don't do it
[24:19] then what are you doing you just say
[24:21] well that's just Tim when we gonna get
[24:23] away from that
[24:24] foreign
[24:27] God has said not putting me in a
[24:29] different place or but we got to believe
[24:30] what our pastor says even when he tells
[24:32] us some things that we don't do
[24:34] sometimes and I've been guilty of it
[24:35] myself right so what have we done
[24:38] are we doing it to him no are we doing
[24:42] it to God but we're hurting the worst
[24:44] person ourselves that's right this is a
[24:47] guy we're hurting that's right like
[24:48] Daddy said last night about uh you know
[24:51] the question came up about Thou shalt
[24:52] not kill
[24:54] well the amount of costs Joshua went in
[24:57] and destroyed them but but many times
[24:59] before like brother job Canada did some
[25:02] research remember the amount of Cox is
[25:04] the one that when they came out of Egypt
[25:05] they came in behind and started killing
[25:07] some of the people or started harassing
[25:09] some of the people and Joshua and Moses
[25:11] sent a group out and and God told him
[25:13] said hey you mess with my kids
[25:15] you're cursed for the rest of your life
[25:17] so the malachites are raised up and God
[25:18] and wipe them off well who did that they
[25:21] did it to their self right
[25:23] if we miss this thing it's not brother
[25:26] Dale's fault it's not my fault it's your
[25:28] fault it's my fault my fault it's our
[25:31] fault because we don't make it right and
[25:33] you know what God's gracious enough
[25:35] he'll tell you
[25:38] this is where you got off right here you
[25:41] took too much time doing this you took
[25:42] too much time doing that you took too
[25:44] much time over here you didn't give me
[25:46] enough time
[25:48] the person was going to take this change
[25:49] of the body is not going to be some
[25:51] superhuman person that walks around with
[25:53] nothing but God on their mind
[25:54] I'm sorry we're still human let's run
[25:57] the random said this thing will be
[25:58] sticky until it's changed right so we
[26:01] have to overcome this thing Jesus
[26:03] overcame this thing right here
[26:05] okay he said well he was virgin born he
[26:07] had no sin he had the same mentality we
[26:10] did
[26:11] he just let it work to the out what was
[26:13] inside of him he let it work to the
[26:15] outside more than we did because we're
[26:18] born in sand shape and iniquity
[26:20] Jesus didn't do things he shouldn't have
[26:22] done
[26:24] are the things he shouldn't have done he
[26:25] didn't do no he did everything he said I
[26:28] only do what father tells me
[26:29] now that don't mean one day he was
[26:31] eating and he dropped his plate and he
[26:32] said oh he's not God no that's just
[26:34] being human right we got to get away
[26:36] from those little human fallacies that
[26:38] that well you can't read right or you
[26:41] can't talk right well that thing got
[26:43] nothing to do with God
[26:45] you guys we got to start in this class
[26:48] today
[26:50] loving the Lord more than we did before
[26:52] because it's not going to be remember
[26:56] we do the same thing we get the same
[26:58] results
[27:00] okay that's Insanity that's right the
[27:03] definition of insanity is you do the
[27:06] same thing over again expecting a
[27:09] different result but you get the same
[27:10] one kind of like a drunk that gets drunk
[27:12] it gets drunk every night
[27:15] same results he's throwing up the next
[27:17] morning but he's doing it saying well
[27:19] maybe I won't do it this time no that's
[27:21] that's uh that's insanity and we got to
[27:25] get out of this in the same world right
[27:28] and hey we got to live here that's right
[27:31] we're not immune
[27:33] right back to Revelations 5 to finish it
[27:35] up Revelations 5 John was standing born
[27:39] again for 60 years
[27:42] but John had a problem
[27:45] he couldn't see somebody that had took
[27:48] all the sin and put it away
[27:52] remember you look for man he looked for
[27:55] somebody
[27:56] some human brother Branson all the
[27:59] prophets were there they all had their
[28:01] problems brother Brian had his problem
[28:03] he had things he couldn't do he couldn't
[28:05] handle money and stuff like that which
[28:07] is but you know what he was the greatest
[28:09] Prophet since Jesus Christ came on the
[28:11] Earth but but if you're not you know
[28:12] that's what people on the internet do
[28:14] they'll start say well they couldn't
[28:15] handle money and he couldn't do this and
[28:16] he couldn't
[28:18] the man brought a message
[28:20] a man brought a message straight from
[28:22] God
[28:23] to a specific group of people now he
[28:27] preached to the whole world to get a lot
[28:28] of people saved and Born Again under
[28:30] their time but when I'm talking about
[28:31] this time right right now
[28:34] all of us that are alive and remain
[28:37] we which are alive and remain you got to
[28:39] be that week right that's right if
[28:42] you're not that we you're going to go by
[28:43] the grave right right and
[28:46] somebody's not to bring you up this
[28:49] and with what you just said you you
[28:51] picture the message went all around the
[28:53] world but you can see
[28:55] magnets
[28:56] I'm sure I'm drawn to that message as
[28:59] one group it was just like Noah and the
[29:01] flood
[29:03] instead of God calling two by two
[29:05] animals he called two by two humans
[29:08] Noah's message went out for 120 years it
[29:10] must have went all over the world
[29:13] right because he condemned the whole
[29:14] world that's right right the whole world
[29:17] now you know we know that before the
[29:19] flood they were more civilized than us
[29:20] what if they had an internet
[29:23] but Moses was preaching to I mean no one
[29:26] was preaching to the whole world
[29:27] so what did God do to save the world
[29:32] for God
[29:33] so loved the world he gave them to God's
[29:36] son to do what to bring you and I in
[29:38] right he loved those creatures
[29:41] so he brought him in from all over the
[29:42] world
[29:43] to one place now brother Rams did not
[29:45] you know don't be gathered in one
[29:47] physical place
[29:48] we're not gathered in one spiritual
[29:50] Place Under the Dome of the message of
[29:53] the hour but born again Christians with
[29:55] a revelation of the message of the hour
[29:57] okay that's what we got to have we can't
[29:59] just be in the message we gotta have a
[30:01] revelation of the message and it's got
[30:03] to be able to change us and transform us
[30:05] into something
[30:07] that's never happened before right yeah
[30:09] yeah but you know what you came and you
[30:11] say well I've never happened before well
[30:13] it's going to because God said it was
[30:15] that's right
[30:17] and you know what Luther I would say
[30:19] probably a group of people called enough
[30:20] for Revelation said man we're going to
[30:22] see the end of the world
[30:25] but that little bit of just shall live
[30:26] by faith wasn't enough to get them out
[30:28] of there it was enough to get them in
[30:29] the body enough to get them born again
[30:30] but not enough to get them to change of
[30:33] the body Wesley same way great powerful
[30:36] man great powerful message went forth
[30:38] and people were saved and filled with
[30:39] the Holy Ghost
[30:40] signs and wonders father
[30:44] but their their uh age was determined to
[30:48] go down
[30:50] then Pentecost comes up greater age
[30:52] Wilder
[30:54] prophecy healing signs and wonders like
[30:56] never been before
[30:58] what do they do they stopped with a
[31:01] period so God said okay
[31:03] they're good people they're born again
[31:05] but I'm going to have to plant them
[31:09] until we get here right
[31:12] see that's what God's been doing he's
[31:14] been planting the Harvest
[31:16] he's been planting people all down
[31:18] through the church ages
[31:19] plant them in corruption because they
[31:21] went down in their human body
[31:23] but there's one group of people that's
[31:25] going to stand on the Earth
[31:27] because when you have all power in
[31:28] heaven and earth
[31:30] what did Jesus do even with just power
[31:32] over the earth when he was standing here
[31:35] he brought Lazarus out of the grave
[31:37] but remember he was sick and he had
[31:40] grown with a headache or maybe not sick
[31:41] but he was tired wearing worn but when
[31:43] he resurrected that man wasn't tired
[31:46] weary and worn he said all power in
[31:48] Heaven and Earth has been given unto me
[31:51] okay so that's where we're gonna go from
[31:53] there we're going to talk about iniquity
[31:55] if you'd like to look up the word
[31:56] iniquity look it up
[31:59] and get the uh and you'll see a lot of
[32:01] them now
[32:02] brother Branham and I'm trying to
[32:05] research back and find out where he got
[32:07] it from
[32:08] most of the time you see iniquity it is
[32:11] a hideous sin that's your
[32:14] definition in Webster is a hideous sense
[32:17] well a hideous sin would be something
[32:20] that you know better to do and you do it
[32:21] anyway right Sans are saying the Hideous
[32:25] then means you knew better you did it
[32:26] anyway or you knew not to I mean you
[32:29] knew to do it and didn't do it okay
[32:32] that's the kids so that's something that
[32:35] we're going to talk about next Sunday
[32:37] uh more Blood Brother Claude and sister
[32:39] Ginger will be here with us next weekend
[32:40] so we're looking for a good time
[32:42] and uh next week will be June's birthday
[32:47] we may have a little cake and ice cream
[32:50] here at the church or something
[32:51] it'll have to be a big day because
[32:54] you'll be 50 years old
