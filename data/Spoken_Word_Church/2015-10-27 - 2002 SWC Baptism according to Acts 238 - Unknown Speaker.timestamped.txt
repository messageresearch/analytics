[0:06] tonight we're glad to have them will we
[0:08] enjoy we have a we had a wonderful time
[0:10] together is it just my mac to the
[0:13] baptismal service that they get to come
[0:15] and participate with us appreciate so
[0:18] we'll ask him if he'll just ask the
[0:19] blessings of the Lord will be a phoner
[0:21] the baptism service today our fathers we
[0:24] are about in your presence here and Lord
[0:28] we realize the significance of this
[0:31] moment in your presence father many
[0:36] times I've related to the candidates
[0:38] what it's not what it really is it's
[0:41] like a funeral service where we bury
[0:44] them yet the arrays and newness of life
[0:46] it's also a wedding where they take on
[0:49] the name of the bridegroom father may
[0:53] the reality of after repentance may the
[0:56] reality of this moment being those that
[1:00] getting baptized may they realize what's
[1:02] taking place in their lives and if the
[1:05] enemy would ever come and try to which
[1:07] he will try to tell them nothing
[1:09] happened let them be able to point back
[1:12] to this scene here at the creek where
[1:16] they may they be able to point back and
[1:20] say here's where we buried the old
[1:22] nature and I rose and newness of life to
[1:25] walk with Jesus Christ father bless this
[1:28] time and may Lord as the gentle dove
[1:31] that came down on the river that day
[1:34] when when the Christ was baptized may
[1:37] that same gentle dub of the Holy Spirit
[1:39] come again this afternoon we commit this
[1:43] baptism of service the words that are
[1:45] going to be spoken descriptions can be
[1:47] read whatever is gonna be done
[1:49] to the hands of Jesus Christ for your
[1:51] leadership and Jesus they know most of
[1:58] you heard enough flame to you know the
[2:01] baptismal and what it is that we don't
[2:05] believe in water baptism into
[2:07] regeneration is not doing that but it's
[2:09] showing what you believe once you're
[2:11] taking out you're taking on the name of
[2:12] Jesus but when you were baptized maybe
[2:15] before and your Father Son and Holy
[2:18] Ghost people in times past and our
[2:21] brother said today they wouldn't
[2:22] responsible for what they heard and done
[2:24] Luther baptized father son Holy Ghost no
[2:26] no but when truth comes you walking
[2:28] through you know and the way I like to
[2:32] baptize gonna remember this I find it a
[2:35] little bit in the prophets message the
[2:37] way he baptized and I do it a little bit
[2:40] different than maybe some of the other
[2:42] brothers do but I make sure one thing
[2:44] that you understand
[2:46] their father son Holy Ghost is in the
[2:50] Bible we're not trying to do away with
[2:53] Richard we're trying to fulfill that
[2:56] spin it's in the Bible to be baptized in
[2:59] the name of the Father and of the Son
[3:01] Holy Ghost but that's 119 yeah and that
[3:05] name is Lord Jesus Christ a father son
[3:10] oh we go Lord Jesus Christ so you'll
[3:13] hear me say now to fulfill the Great
[3:15] Commission to baptize in the name of the
[3:18] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[3:19] Ghost I now baptize you my brother my
[3:21] sister in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:22] Christ so there's no way you can do to
[3:24] man and we we know that and you don't
[3:27] make fun of nobody else's believe your
[3:29] thoughts of what they believe because
[3:31] you and I believe those things at one
[3:32] time we thank god for true he said use
[3:37] your nose Dietrich it's not true truth
[3:41] of key will be truth will set you free
[3:43] so let's just read the scriptures from
[3:46] Romans 6 i'd like to read istanbul we go
[3:49] into the baptism Romans 61 what should
[3:53] we save him shall we continue in sin
[3:55] that grace may abound god forbid how
[3:59] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[4:00] longer therein no you not tell me you
[4:03] busted for meth oh Jesus Christ were
[4:06] baptized into his death therefore we are
[4:09] buried with him by baptism into death
[4:11] that like as Christ was raised up from
[4:14] the dead by the glory of the Father even
[4:16] so we also should walk in newness of
[4:19] life where we have been planted together
[4:22] in the likeness of his death we shall be
[4:25] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[4:27] knowing this that our old man is
[4:29] crucified with him that the body of sin
[4:31] might be destroyed that his former
[4:33] should not sure for he that is dead is
[4:36] straight from cincy that's what
[4:38] your baptism is you're going down your
[4:40] brother McRae and into a grave you know
[4:44] you're dying to yourself can you come
[4:46] forward to walking in unison Christ so
[4:48] that's this what Paul's explain if we
[4:52] were we be dead with props we believe
[4:54] that we shall also live with me knowing
[4:56] that Christ being raised from the dead
[4:58] diced no more death has no more dominion
[5:01] over friend that he died he died unto
[5:03] sin once but in that he liveth he liveth
[5:06] under God likewise reckon you're also
[5:10] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[5:12] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[5:15] our Lord that's that's a wonderful thing
[5:19] to think about what you're going to do
[5:21] you know not just a quick little run in
[5:24] history it was customary like back in
[5:28] the in the Bible for them to baptize
[5:30] people that were their followers and
[5:32] that was kind of roll over in and it
[5:35] became the truth the description now
[5:36] that wouldn't just haphazard God just he
[5:40] knew that was going to be but see the
[5:42] truth is you are being baptized to
[5:45] follow a follower to be a follower of
[5:47] Christ the asked what's your baptism
[5:50] means is you're going down you're dying
[5:52] to yourself and come up
[5:56] newness of life
[7:05] how that regard
[7:08] right then as we baptize men north as we
[7:14] are all witnesses of your majesty I she
[7:18] be a witness for
[7:21] st you
[7:24] thank you we commit it now to you Nordic
[7:27] Jesus man will feel the great commission
