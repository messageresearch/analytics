[4:50] cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name
[4:53] amen and amen okay
[4:57] Revelations
[4:59] one
[5:00] that we've been reading for quite a
[5:02] while
[5:04] in Revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[5:06] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[5:09] things which must shortly come to pass
[5:12] and he said and signified it by his
[5:14] Angel unto his servant John who by
[5:16] record of the word of God and the
[5:18] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[5:20] things that he saw
[5:21] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[5:23] hear the words of this prophecy what
[5:25] about a great blessing for you and I are
[5:27] at and keep those things which are
[5:29] written therein or the time is at hand
[5:33] now we're going to today take a
[5:38] doubt and make it on the complete Plan
[5:40] of Redemption so let's go over and read
[5:43] what Paul says
[5:45] in the ninth chapter of Hebrews
[5:48] not 1 through 15.
[5:51] then verily the first Covenant and also
[5:53] ordinances of divine service and the
[5:56] world is sanctuary
[5:58] for dire was a tabernacle there was a
[6:01] tabernacle made the first we're in was
[6:03] cam the Candlestick and the table and
[6:06] the shoe bread which is called the
[6:07] sanctuary
[6:08] and after this after the second Veil The
[6:11] Tabernacle which is called a holist of
[6:13] all
[6:14] which had the golden sensor and the Ark
[6:17] of the Covenant overlaid round about
[6:19] with gold we're in was the golden pot
[6:22] that had Manna and everyone's Rod that
[6:24] buddied and the tables of the Covenant
[6:28] and over it the cherubims of the glory
[6:30] of Glory shattering The Mercy Seat of
[6:33] which we cannot now speak particularly
[6:36] now when these things were thus ordained
[6:39] the priests went always into the first
[6:42] Tabernacle accepting or accomplishing
[6:45] excuse me
[6:46] the service of God but into the second
[6:49] went the high priest alone once every
[6:51] year not without blood which he offered
[6:54] for himself and for the errors of the
[6:56] people
[6:57] and the Holy Ghost does this signifying
[6:59] that the way into the holiest
[7:02] of all was not yet made manifest well as
[7:06] the first Tabernacle was yet standing in
[7:08] the word Jesus Christ hadn't come and
[7:09] died so you couldn't go through the
[7:12] complete point right
[7:14] which was a figure for the time than
[7:16] present in which were offered both gifts
[7:19] and sacrifices that could not make him
[7:21] that did the service perfect that's
[7:24] pertaining to the conscience see there's
[7:26] no soul back there
[7:28] right to enter into the believer to
[7:31] bring him into the correct way now
[7:33] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[7:36] divers Washings and carnal ordinances
[7:38] imposed on them until the time of
[7:41] reformation now that word Reformation is
[7:44] uh setting things right you know getting
[7:47] it correctly not not the great
[7:49] Reformation of Luther Wesley all right
[7:51] now
[7:53] but Christ being come and high priest of
[7:57] good things to come by a greater and
[7:58] more perfect Tabernacle
[8:00] not made with hands that is to say not
[8:03] of this building neither by the blood of
[8:05] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[8:07] entered in once into the holy Place
[8:10] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[8:13] us
[8:14] for Earth the blood of bulls and and of
[8:17] goats and the ashes of an heifer
[8:19] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the
[8:22] purifying of the Flesh in other words if
[8:24] that done back dire how much more shall
[8:28] the blood of Christ through the eternal
[8:30] spirit offered himself without spot to
[8:33] God
[8:35] Purge your conscience from dead Works to
[8:37] serve the Living God
[8:38] and for this cause he is the metered
[8:40] mediator of the New Testament that by
[8:43] means of death for the Redemption of the
[8:45] transgressors aggressions that were
[8:48] under the first testament they which are
[8:50] called might receive the promise of
[8:53] Eternal inheritance we may be seated the
[8:56] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[8:59] the word
[9:00] now
[9:04] I'm going to try to preach
[9:08] as much as I can without reading I've
[9:10] got a few quotes I need to feel
[9:12] necessary to read but
[9:15] how this quote you know when you keep
[9:17] going
[9:18] and uh I want to just take a thought on
[9:23] a complete Plan of Redemption
[9:26] and taking it from word that we've been
[9:28] studying
[9:30] in the Book of Revelations
[9:33] and we've come up through and brought it
[9:36] out onto our life's thoughts we're
[9:37] dealing with the 144 thousand
[9:41] of the chosen of Israel and the
[9:44] Redemptive plan for them and then coming
[9:47] into
[9:48] seeing what would be in this day so I
[9:51] just thought I would just preach a
[9:53] message on it and then we'll have
[9:56] questions and answers Wednesday night so
[9:58] write down your questions and we'll try
[10:00] our best to cover it you know because I
[10:02] love questions and answers
[10:04] you know because they bring out what's
[10:06] on our thoughts all right
[10:09] now
[10:11] a complete plan or the complete Plan of
[10:13] Redemption
[10:16] now I'm going to be dealing with
[10:19] bringing it not to just try to show this
[10:23] that you know a point I'm talking about
[10:25] the Plan of Redemption For All Mankind
[10:30] yeah all right which will finality in
[10:33] the in to the world would even come
[10:37] forth and and be in that redeemed part
[10:40] good to see Sterling back there with us
[10:42] get him back with us and get him out of
[10:45] those places in the hospital thank God
[10:47] for being with him and taking care of it
[10:50] man
[10:51] but now do you understand what I'm doing
[10:53] I'm going to try to bring a message of
[10:55] the complete Plan of Redemption and if
[10:58] I'm slow I'm gonna have to try to follow
[11:00] my notes as much as I can
[11:02] because if I don't I'll jump over and
[11:05] get off the topic that I want to deal
[11:08] with
[11:09] so now remember if I were you I would
[11:12] even jot down as we go along because
[11:14] when I'm speaking of our thankless he'll
[11:18] be speaking of the Old Testament Saints
[11:19] the bride uh the foolish virgins the 144
[11:24] 000 two witnesses dealing and the fifth
[11:27] sealed Jew
[11:28] all right so now that's five
[11:32] groups of people
[11:34] to be dealing with so now don't cross me
[11:37] up and just think your mind cuts off and
[11:39] you you're going along and you're
[11:41] listening and I changed from Full
[11:43] Experience to the bride and then you
[11:46] just keep on going
[11:48] well you're going to totally
[11:49] misunderstand what I'm talking about and
[11:51] accuse me of saying something that I'm
[11:53] not saying so listen
[11:56] and I'll try my best to say this is this
[11:59] this is this this is this two or three
[12:02] times to make sure you understand
[12:03] because I know how the human brain works
[12:07] uh it'll do we we had the uh
[12:11] a good life last night because sister
[12:13] Trudy had brought a a rock to the house
[12:17] it's got a light but in it and it's
[12:20] supposed to keep you from snoring well
[12:23] it get it home for us because we
[12:25] couldn't sleep with a light on
[12:29] so it worked all right
[12:32] so
[12:34] I got it down under the pulpit
[12:39] anybody get that
[12:44] doctor's sleeping this morning
[12:46] all right we may hire your high a few
[12:49] times
[12:50] try to get through by two o'clock but we
[12:53] want to do that
[12:55] but listen
[12:57] I think it's necessary that we
[12:59] understand the Plan of Redemption that's
[13:01] right and I will not be dealing with
[13:03] just what happens to the soul what
[13:05] happens to the body what happened I'm
[13:07] going to be dealing with the people
[13:11] you know and the groups of people that
[13:14] are involved in Redemption
[13:17] all right and that away see then we'll
[13:19] try to cover it and like I said This is
[13:21] 40 something years
[13:23] I've studied in one message to try to
[13:26] pick up and see what the prophet has
[13:28] said about it and the Bible and to be
[13:30] able to follow it all right now to speak
[13:33] about Redemption
[13:36] we start off by saying that it means
[13:39] someone
[13:40] or something called the deal with the
[13:42] world
[13:44] but someone is lost
[13:46] all right now I do not believe of the
[13:49] doctrines of the people of the message
[13:51] that you come into the world with
[13:52] eternal life
[13:53] because if you do that way then you're
[13:56] going to bypass Calvary you don't need
[13:58] Jesus
[13:59] Etc I Believe by God's foreknowledge
[14:03] by his predestination
[14:06] the I believe that he can say you always
[14:11] was eternal but if you'll keep reading
[14:13] you'll see he says if you have the new
[14:16] birth if I have the baptism of the Holy
[14:18] Ghost right right it's not just basing
[14:20] that you're eternal
[14:22] right even dealing with the bride on it
[14:24] see I believe we all come lost that's
[14:27] right because of the fall in the garden
[14:30] all mankind everybody yes
[14:35] is lost
[14:37] and needs a savior all right right now
[14:42] we know that Adam and Eve caused that
[14:44] problem
[14:45] because they were not lost right but
[14:49] they became lost
[14:50] and that was our representation that put
[14:53] us into a place of needing a savior all
[14:57] right now
[15:00] and to do that then
[15:02] if we realize we're lost
[15:05] and want to be redeemed the prophet of
[15:08] God made the statement one day he said
[15:10] you know if I wanted to be saved he said
[15:13] it's up to God to make a way amen amen
[15:16] when he said he did through the blood of
[15:18] Jesus Christ all right now so then we
[15:21] start off by dealing with this that
[15:24] first we realize we're lost now to you
[15:27] out there that always was eternals and
[15:29] all you just go on go ahead just forget
[15:31] it I'm preaching to my people not to you
[15:34] if you're listening that's your business
[15:37] but this is what I'm trying to bring to
[15:39] the church at Lula all right
[15:41] now see then it means also if there's
[15:45] someone lost
[15:48] it would mean that there'd have to be
[15:50] someone who could pay the price that's
[15:52] right
[15:53] now the one who paid the price came
[15:56] first
[15:58] right the loss came second
[16:03] Jesus Christ is our savior Our Redeemer
[16:06] are all in all and we believe that he's
[16:08] almighty God the prophet of God said on
[16:11] the breach's message paragraph 138
[16:14] . he said there had to be a person
[16:15] according to the Book of Ruth
[16:18] that would be according to the g-o-e-l
[16:21] gold whatever how you would pronounce it
[16:23] but he said that person would not only
[16:26] have to be someone they would first have
[16:28] to be someone kin folks amen
[16:31] second they would have to be someone
[16:34] capable of paying the price
[16:37] and thirdly someone who was willing to
[16:39] pay the price
[16:41] all right so then we know that it was
[16:43] left up to almighty God to make a way
[16:46] for you and I to be saved amen and we
[16:49] know for a certainty then
[16:51] that he wants to save us because he even
[16:55] said the scripture you know he he
[16:57] wouldn't everybody be healed and
[16:58] everybody be sunny and we know it's not
[17:01] done away but that's not what we're
[17:02] dealing with all right but see he's not
[17:06] only
[17:07] wanting to do it
[17:09] he came down and paid the price
[17:12] all right now he done it because he
[17:15] wanted to not because he had to
[17:19] he wanted to save mankind he wanted to
[17:22] impart his own life into you and I so he
[17:25] would make a way for that so he would
[17:27] truly be the one who would meet the
[17:31] requirements he would be the goal as we
[17:33] would call it in the in the words are
[17:35] all right
[17:38] then thinking about the fact that we
[17:41] were lost
[17:43] and no hopes of redemption
[17:48] then we realized that immediately God
[17:51] started in Genesis
[17:53] when man fell
[17:56] he started to make a way
[18:00] for that Redemptive plan right
[18:03] so you find Genesis 3 15 that what I'll
[18:07] put enmity between thy seed and the seed
[18:10] of the woman that was the promise of the
[18:12] coming of the Messiah
[18:15] Prophet said it on e13 of the Messiah
[18:18] 61. promise of the Messiah that would
[18:22] come that could pay the price for
[18:25] Redemption
[18:27] for you and I all right
[18:29] now that that guy would be then a
[18:34] Redemptive plan
[18:38] and we'll get back to it in a minute but
[18:40] it would have to mean too that that
[18:41] person would have to come down
[18:45] in dwelling human flesh to pay that
[18:47] price
[18:48] all right so it means you would have to
[18:51] have a savior a redeemer to come forth
[18:54] all right now the Plan of Redemption is
[18:57] revealed in the word of God
[18:59] paragraph 321 of The Sixth Seal
[19:02] it's revealed in the seals the seals
[19:06] brings a complete Plan of Redemption
[19:10] for Body Spirit soul and world
[19:14] is revealed through the opening of the
[19:16] seal now just making points and then
[19:19] we'll get down into our thought all
[19:20] right now
[19:22] the word Redemption
[19:25] it means two parts
[19:27] it means out of
[19:30] and into that's paragraph 57 with the
[19:33] paradox
[19:34] at all and into
[19:38] right
[19:39] now so that means that you must come out
[19:43] of
[19:44] whatever condition or existence or
[19:46] whatever we call it being lost
[19:49] we must not only come out of that
[19:52] repent
[19:53] right no
[19:56] try to walk right do right live right
[19:59] yes but not only that we've got to have
[20:03] a way to be able to get into
[20:07] no
[20:08] and see he made the way by coming
[20:11] himself
[20:12] to pay our price to redeem us so now we
[20:17] can come out of
[20:19] and we can go into but now remember that
[20:23] as we go along
[20:25] and you'll see what I'm trying to say
[20:27] what the prophet is trying to say of
[20:29] redemption of coming out and going in
[20:34] all right
[20:36] now everything
[20:40] that you and I get must come by faith
[20:43] right
[20:46] but just you'll live by faith
[20:49] you're saved by grace through faith
[20:55] the great Hebrews 11 that we read and
[20:57] study of the great warriors of what we
[21:00] call Faith
[21:02] all right now
[21:05] it's very important to believe in how to
[21:08] Faith
[21:09] Hebrews 11 6 says
[21:13] that without faith it's impossible
[21:17] to serve God because he that cometh to
[21:21] God Must Believe
[21:23] what he was no
[21:27] he is
[21:30] and a rewarder of them that diligently
[21:32] seek him
[21:33] right now when we go along that's Rina I
[21:35] want you to go with me as these stages
[21:38] as we go along
[21:40] but remember everything is based upon a
[21:43] faith
[21:46] and that Faith must be a belief in God
[21:51] amen because you can't approach him
[21:52] without that that's right man you got to
[21:55] believe that he is
[21:58] see that's where the world teaches God
[22:00] was
[22:01] right the religious society today
[22:04] teaches God was
[22:09] but we have to believe that God is
[22:13] now so everything of redemption will be
[22:17] based upon a belief
[22:20] in a reality of a real God
[22:24] not just thoughts now that's right maybe
[22:27] not about a god
[22:30] but a reality of a living God
[22:34] who's living today
[22:36] you know he's Hebrews 13 8.
[22:39] then eat out to be the same today as he
[22:42] was yesterday or he missed it somewhere
[22:44] right around and said that's where Eve
[22:47] found up in the garden
[22:49] he said she didn't believe him to be
[22:51] Hebrews 13 9.
[22:54] he said well that wasn't even back guard
[22:56] no she didn't believe that God would
[22:59] keep his word
[23:02] she thought she got by with what she was
[23:04] doing
[23:06] and because God didn't kill her right
[23:08] then
[23:09] you kind of like you and I sometimes we
[23:11] think well boy I got by with that one
[23:13] right but
[23:16] you better study a while he might not
[23:17] get by all right all right but now
[23:21] everything that we get is based upon
[23:23] faith
[23:27] faith
[23:29] as a belief
[23:31] and what's the way I'm saying it
[23:34] faith that is a belief
[23:37] in God being real
[23:40] well
[23:41] now
[23:42] that is not to go over into the point of
[23:45] this saying
[23:46] his faith
[23:49] and different things you say what I'm
[23:51] saying
[23:53] everybody's salvation is based upon
[23:57] what they believe about God
[24:00] no matter who we are or what's going on
[24:03] see that's what's required
[24:06] so what name we must come out of our
[24:08] thinking right
[24:10] and go into his word
[24:13] or his thoughts
[24:15] or to accept what he says
[24:18] we were talking about it last night in
[24:20] the Bible study see when When God says
[24:23] I'm righteous I'm supposed to say what
[24:25] he says
[24:31] and you're a liar
[24:34] if you don't say
[24:36] by the new birth that you're just as
[24:39] righteous as God is that's right you're
[24:41] a liar so which way do you want to be
[24:43] one
[24:44] all right I had hit brother keep saying
[24:47] what God says that's right amen
[24:52] he says I'm perfect
[24:55] well I just don't know where we'll see
[24:57] that and you don't have the revelation
[24:58] of God that's right that's it that's my
[25:01] point your faith is not anchored
[25:04] faith is not anchored in letters of a
[25:07] word or a thoughtful idea that we have
[25:09] or what's been taught to us
[25:14] we used to believe that
[25:16] you couldn't tell this difference in the
[25:18] seasons except the abundance of the
[25:19] trees and the shedding of the leaves
[25:21] that ain't even in the Bible
[25:25] we used to believe that ever tell us
[25:26] that on its own bottom that ain't in the
[25:28] Bible
[25:31] we used to believe it's better to plant
[25:32] your seed in the belly of the than
[25:34] to put it on the ground that ain't in
[25:35] the Bible
[25:37] well I've heard it all my life and
[25:40] grandma told me that well grandma lied
[25:43] all right
[25:46] that was her idea
[25:48] well you're against my grandma
[25:49] regardless what you get into you start
[25:52] talking to people about something and
[25:54] they say
[25:55] you mean my mama's lost
[25:58] they ain't talking to Mama
[26:01] talking to me and you
[26:03] mama had her experience
[26:07] my man
[26:08] but my point is that we've had a lot of
[26:10] ideas that we thought the Bible said
[26:21] a lot of things he didn't say
[26:23] so we're back in the same day right now
[26:27] but listen
[26:28] see we've got to come out of our
[26:30] thinking
[26:32] to even start a journey of redemption
[26:36] that's right
[26:39] put into come out of our thinking
[26:42] and get into what he said
[26:46] in his word
[26:48] but it's got to be based on faith
[26:50] all right now watch that point now
[26:55] in the Old Testament
[26:58] the people
[27:01] they believed in God
[27:04] I'm not talking about all of the people
[27:06] because all the people that believe in
[27:08] God
[27:09] I'm not even talking about all the
[27:11] Israelites
[27:12] I mean you know whatever what you want
[27:13] to call them
[27:16] I'm talking about that there was people
[27:18] who could believe
[27:21] and they believe that God was real they
[27:25] had a faith in God
[27:27] they believed he was real
[27:30] you know what they experienced him being
[27:32] real about many miracles and signs and
[27:34] wonders amen that's right and that faith
[27:38] that they had
[27:40] in God
[27:43] even though it was not a new birth
[27:45] experience in the soul because we just
[27:47] read that you couldn't have had that
[27:49] until the death of the testator
[27:51] all right
[27:53] but yet it was a belief in God
[27:55] they live good lives and they've done
[27:57] the best they could do on a lot of
[27:59] scales
[28:00] but it was not a
[28:04] New Birth that would not come until
[28:07] Jesus Christ would come into being none
[28:10] but yet they had a belief
[28:13] a belief in that God is real
[28:17] God was real to Abraham to Moses to to
[28:21] those you know right he was real
[28:25] he wasn't just a thought
[28:28] he was real
[28:30] all right
[28:31] now do we have that kind of regard
[28:34] ourselves come on amen amen
[28:38] uh are we do we have the the god of
[28:41] Abraham of the god of William Brett oh
[28:44] my God
[28:46] will Brown his mind
[28:49] well be careful you might call him
[28:51] you're gone right
[28:54] thank God for the message he brought
[28:57] amen amen
[28:59] but the messenger wasn't God himself in
[29:02] the human vessel all right
[29:04] now
[29:06] those people believed now I'm laying
[29:09] this down as a background the word I'm
[29:11] going to get to it in a minute you'll
[29:12] understand
[29:14] those people believe that a real God
[29:17] and you know when they died
[29:19] they had a place to go to
[29:24] out of him to keep that in your mind
[29:28] they had a place to go to
[29:33] that place in the Old Testament was
[29:35] called Paradise
[29:40] or another word for it was called the
[29:43] bosom of Abraham
[29:46] right
[29:48] Jesus told the thief on the cross during
[29:50] the scripture that this day you'll be
[29:53] with me
[29:54] in Paradise that's right see when those
[29:58] Old Testament Saints died
[30:00] no not all of them see I'm trying to
[30:02] emphasize that right
[30:05] not every Israelite went to the place
[30:07] called Paradise
[30:09] a lot of them went to a place on down
[30:11] lower than that
[30:13] called Hadi shogohana hail
[30:17] a place to abide
[30:20] because that was the only two places in
[30:22] the Old Testament
[30:24] he was either in Hell or you was in
[30:27] Paradise
[30:28] there's no uh gray area
[30:32] because it wasn't made possible back
[30:34] then
[30:35] all right
[30:37] now in doing that see then they were
[30:40] in Paradise
[30:42] when Lazarus looked up during Luke 16.
[30:47] he saw the
[30:50] you know when the Rich Young Ruler or
[30:52] the guy looked up he seen
[30:54] Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham
[30:57] that's right
[30:58] now that wasn't Abraham's Billy
[31:01] that's right right right
[31:05] the bosom was meaning the paradise from
[31:07] the Old Testament
[31:10] you remember when Jesus descended he
[31:13] went to paradise and brought him out
[31:14] he'll get to that in a minute
[31:17] but just because it would say the bosom
[31:19] of Abraham
[31:21] he's not talking about his Bentley we're
[31:23] certainly not that carnal but it was a
[31:26] place provided by the faith
[31:30] of Abraham
[31:34] all right
[31:35] those people depended upon that was
[31:38] brought by Abraham
[31:40] that was why Jesus had to descend if
[31:42] you'll notice your scriptures
[31:44] Jesus had to descend to hell
[31:47] to preach to the spirits or Souls that
[31:50] were in prison that were disobedient in
[31:53] the long suffering the days of Noah
[31:54] right
[31:58] now they had a place that they died
[32:00] Noah died he had a place to go to
[32:04] call it Paradise
[32:07] because it was emptied up and taken up
[32:09] but I want you to get this point now
[32:11] it's out of and into
[32:15] your faith brings you out of an
[32:19] existence or a condition or a thoughts
[32:21] or carnality or sin or whatever you want
[32:25] to make it
[32:27] but if that's real and genuine it means
[32:30] you have a place to go to right
[32:33] the old Indian called it the happy
[32:34] hunting ground and that's not too far
[32:36] off in the word Paradise
[32:38] if you look it up
[32:41] but think about it now
[32:45] a place to go to
[32:49] to wait
[32:51] for the full Plan of Redemption
[32:55] to be made manifest
[32:57] all right
[32:59] now
[33:02] when Jesus Christ came
[33:08] and said he said to the
[33:10] Thief he said you'll be with me in
[33:12] Paradise
[33:14] all right he goes to Paradise
[33:19] and you know what happens he empty his
[33:21] paradise right
[33:23] when Jesus Christ went down to hell he
[33:25] went down preaching the spirits in
[33:27] prison different but when he come back
[33:29] by he
[33:30] the open Paradise lift up the
[33:32] Everlasting gate for the kingdom of
[33:33] Glory to go into this king of glory Lord
[33:35] Mighty and hosts and all right he
[33:37] brought forth Those Old Testament Saints
[33:42] because they were in The Plan of
[33:45] Redemption
[33:47] they're believing had brought them out
[33:49] of the world
[33:53] Abram was a heathen worshiper
[33:59] of the childish or something he comes
[34:01] from he was a heathen that his
[34:03] daddy-in-law or daddy one was making
[34:05] Idol that's what he doesn't make a
[34:06] living
[34:07] huh
[34:08] but see one day God spoke to him
[34:12] he come out of that condition or
[34:14] existence
[34:16] his belief was anchored in God
[34:21] all right well now you see what I'm
[34:23] talking about all the Old Testament
[34:26] won't be saved all the New Testament
[34:28] won't be saved right
[34:30] right so remember that
[34:32] all Jews won't be saved whatever
[34:36] it's only those who can have their
[34:39] belief in God in the correct way and God
[34:42] honored that belief
[34:47] now follow that point God honor that
[34:49] belief he made a place that they could
[34:51] go to
[34:54] and to prove that they were redeemable
[34:58] he went
[35:00] and opened up Paradise
[35:04] so let's just start reading a few of
[35:06] these now
[35:09] Mark these were the brothers could start
[35:11] because I want to make sure you get
[35:12] these points because you'd argue with
[35:15] this or that or the other so go ahead
[35:17] with number
[35:18] seven brother
[35:20] and let's just read what happened when
[35:23] Jesus Christ died now this is all a
[35:25] foundation that's right maybe two
[35:27] o'clock but this is a foundation for
[35:29] what I want to say
[35:30] go get the foundation right you'll
[35:32] understand message Jehovah Jireh e27
[35:36] brother Brown says it like this
[35:39] but when Jesus died sin wasn't covered
[35:43] it was only covered in the Old Testament
[35:45] right
[35:47] but when Jesus Christ died it wasn't
[35:49] just covered it was divorced and done
[35:51] away with and when he left it then he
[35:55] emptied paradise and led captivity
[35:57] captive
[35:59] and they come out of the graves and they
[36:01] went in with the Lord Jesus according to
[36:03] Matthew 27.
[36:04] and when he finished his work they went
[36:06] on in being taken up
[36:10] in a form called a rapture
[36:14] because they were lifted up all right
[36:17] now
[36:19] Paradise being taken up
[36:22] or emptied
[36:27] you say well did it leave a hole see
[36:29] that's what we want to get into what
[36:30] we've got to have all this happen no it
[36:32] wouldn't hold left
[36:36] it was taken up
[36:40] because the king of paradise was there
[36:43] the god of paradise
[36:46] they wanted all those prophets and
[36:49] things had spoken on
[36:50] was standing there
[36:53] so he wouldn't have just went into
[36:54] paradise and say hi I'm here
[36:59] they came out with him
[37:02] proving they were redeemable at a place
[37:04] to go to them other than just their
[37:08] I hope you catch this point for later
[37:10] see other than just their point of dying
[37:13] when they died they had a place to go to
[37:15] their belief in God made a place that
[37:18] they could go and abide
[37:20] but that Not only was the end of the
[37:22] story because they were taken out yeah
[37:27] Paradise was emptied out
[37:31] brother rattle said on the Rapture
[37:33] message number eight
[37:35] the Old Testament science has gone into
[37:37] his presence Paradise done away
[37:43] Old Testament of sin and all that they
[37:45] went out with him in a rapture
[37:48] all right but if it done away
[37:55] what happened to Paradise when Jesus
[37:57] raised
[38:02] all right let's read a scripture
[38:04] back up to 7A now really
[38:08] second Corinthians 12 and 4 says
[38:12] talking of Paul
[38:16] that he was caught up
[38:19] in the paradise
[38:24] that's your scripture so Paradise wasn't
[38:26] annihilated
[38:32] because Paul went there
[38:34] Steve
[38:37] that's what the Bible said that's what
[38:39] we're going to believe
[38:40] well it looks like it's done away yep
[38:42] right around and said it's emptied out
[38:44] he says it's gone
[38:46] or done away
[38:48] but it's not done away it just moved the
[38:51] position
[38:54] amen
[38:56] from being the existence of one place
[39:00] you're still without oven too now and
[39:03] moved up into what we call Heaven
[39:08] Paul later says he was taken up to the
[39:10] third heaven
[39:13] but he says here he was taken up to
[39:15] Paradise
[39:17] to Paradise went up
[39:20] not just the people
[39:24] you realize what took place at Calvary
[39:28] not only did he pay the price
[39:31] of All That Old Testament Saints
[39:34] and all of their sacrifices and
[39:37] offerings that spoke of him
[39:41] but he proved that they were redeemable
[39:45] because he took them up with him
[39:50] true
[39:52] now
[39:56] when Jesus Christ has paid the price
[40:05] held it and empty up
[40:09] it goes right on waiting on the rest of
[40:11] people get there
[40:14] the paradise was taken up into what is a
[40:17] said we call Heaven
[40:19] all right could you see if you're
[40:22] redeemable you've got to have a way to
[40:24] get out of some condition but you also
[40:27] got to have a place to go to amen right
[40:33] so you've heard the story that Jesus
[40:35] paid for the Old Testament in the New
[40:37] Testament that's what I'm trying to
[40:38] describe
[40:39] to prove that he paid the price
[40:43] Paradise wasn't annihilated
[40:50] the people that were there were not
[40:52] annihilated they were taken up with
[40:55] Jesus
[40:57] you know they're now in what we call
[40:59] Heaven
[41:03] a paradise
[41:05] still waiting
[41:08] because there's a part of redemption is
[41:09] not complete yet
[41:12] so they're still having to wait
[41:16] so you and I we come into the world as
[41:18] lost
[41:21] we realize we need to stay here
[41:26] and even if you were in a Badness when
[41:29] you believed it or Methodist or
[41:31] Presbyterian
[41:32] if you come on to the message like you
[41:34] have then it proved that you had more
[41:37] than they had
[41:44] come on not be little nobody you know be
[41:47] little and everybody or say that
[41:49] just being straight honest
[41:52] because you proved where you're at
[41:56] you proved you were redeemable
[42:01] by coming out
[42:03] and going on
[42:06] see your belief in God was anchored in
[42:09] even as I said even though you didn't
[42:11] know the message Maybe
[42:13] right
[42:15] so you couldn't tell me when I was in
[42:17] the Baptist Church there were three gods
[42:22] now I didn't know how to explain it but
[42:24] you couldn't convince me there was three
[42:25] of them
[42:27] that just didn't make no common sense
[42:29] then in a short open night
[42:36] all right
[42:37] see because I had a belief in God
[42:41] you know why because I've seen him
[42:45] you know what I'd heard him speaking to
[42:47] me
[42:50] that's unreal then
[42:52] right
[42:55] you said well brother damn I never hurt
[42:57] God or never saw him like you you that
[42:59] was just for me
[43:00] that's right that's right right but you
[43:03] had your experience
[43:05] amen you're doing you're living your
[43:07] life and doing
[43:11] see I didn't have to come into the
[43:13] message a lot to learn that it was wrong
[43:15] to commit adultery I didn't have to come
[43:18] in the message and learn it was wrong to
[43:19] smoke drink too
[43:22] blind sealed
[43:27] that's already settled a long time ago
[43:30] even though I was just in a Justified
[43:32] State because I didn't receive the new
[43:34] birthplace after I come in this message
[43:37] see most everybody thinks they got it
[43:39] back Yonder
[43:40] and it brought it well what brought me
[43:42] because I'm telling you right in front
[43:43] of you I didn't get the new birth in the
[43:45] old in the Baptist Church
[43:48] I can believe I was justified and
[43:50] Sanctified in my belief in God
[43:54] when that Prophet started talking about
[43:55] a new birth and God the way he was and
[43:57] come living in you I knew right real
[43:59] quick he had something I didn't have
[44:01] right not all these signs and wonders I
[44:04] was just talking about what he was
[44:06] telling about God he had a reality with
[44:08] God
[44:09] that's right not because he saw visions
[44:12] and everything when he was a baby but
[44:14] because he experienced that God he knew
[44:16] that God
[44:18] he was talking about something that's
[44:19] real we talked about one of these days
[44:21] maybe I hope maybe maybe we say I hope
[44:24] we are go when we get up to heaven we're
[44:26] gonna find out we are
[44:27] now come on that's what we've done
[44:30] that's right
[44:33] right but you see Church something
[44:34] happened about some people because they
[44:37] believed that a real God existed
[44:42] all right
[44:44] then when we heard this message
[44:48] we come out of organized religion that's
[44:51] right and into the message right Amen to
[44:55] prove there was nothing there that was
[44:57] leading us
[44:58] all right we come out of the world
[45:02] of being lost
[45:04] and started our journey into wars being
[45:08] born again
[45:12] we received a new birth
[45:14] which was
[45:16] the Old Testament people couldn't
[45:18] receive because Jesus Christ hadn't died
[45:21] so we received a new birth
[45:24] yes
[45:25] all right
[45:26] that put us a place that we had come out
[45:29] of
[45:31] and Jesus according to John 14 says
[45:35] I go to prepare place for you
[45:41] so he went and provided that place
[45:44] where'd he go up come right back living
[45:46] in here where is he providing the place
[45:49] that we really need right in here all
[45:52] right forgive me
[45:55] I am healed but I still have to cough no
[45:59] no
[46:03] so we not only had that or have that
[46:08] you realize that when we received the
[46:10] new birth as I said we come out of the
[46:11] world and come into Christ right
[46:15] all right then we come out of organized
[46:17] religion we come into the message
[46:20] I think now what we need to do is come
[46:22] out of the message and get in the
[46:23] message
[46:25] best way for me to say is but you know
[46:28] that's my point but because it's not
[46:31] whether that I'm in the message or
[46:33] whether the message isn't me
[46:35] now amen but see not only that when you
[46:38] receive that new birth you know you had
[46:39] a place to go to if you died right
[46:43] Paul described it in second Corinthians
[46:45] 5 1 says this Earthly how can I
[46:47] Tabernacle be dissolved or word
[46:49] dissolved
[46:51] we have a place amen so we're have
[46:54] somewhere to go to we don't have to
[46:55] worry
[46:57] and we know that when this all finishes
[46:58] up we're going to raise
[47:02] right right in the glorified body this
[47:06] body made new not another one all right
[47:09] so we have a place to go to
[47:12] so it's out of and into
[47:15] right
[47:17] all right
[47:18] now
[47:19] so we'll take that hard and just go down
[47:22] and skip a page or two and
[47:24] start to thinking
[47:28] now let's start a whole Plan of
[47:30] Redemption
[47:33] and see where we can put it together in
[47:35] the right way
[47:37] and this is going to be repeated three
[47:39] times
[47:41] because I just reached done one now
[47:44] we're going through again then we're
[47:45] going through again all right
[47:47] that's the only way I know to express it
[47:51] Those Old Testament people had a
[47:53] belief in God
[47:56] not just talking about God
[47:59] they had a belief or a faith in God and
[48:01] you know it's provided a place for them
[48:03] to go to
[48:06] their belief that they had provided them
[48:08] a bosom of Abraham or a paradise or
[48:11] whatever they were calling it it was
[48:13] made dark now note I said not every
[48:16] Israelite
[48:19] only the ones who had a belief in a real
[48:22] God that's right
[48:26] I hope that sinks down
[48:29] maybe it'll get better about a lot of
[48:31] this we're in the message
[48:32] yes yeah
[48:35] and get down to find out what the
[48:36] message is about
[48:41] and you know that to prove that as we
[48:44] covered one time
[48:48] see one day they came God came to them
[48:53] in the bushing of Abraham or Paradise
[48:56] and took them up
[49:03] where did they go to
[49:06] here's the argument that we'll get into
[49:08] them later
[49:10] in a thought
[49:13] and I'll hold most of that thought until
[49:15] then but where did they go to and what
[49:16] happened In Those Old Testament Saints
[49:19] came up what happened
[49:21] yeah
[49:23] so you can take one point of saying that
[49:26] they raised in glorified bodies
[49:28] I show that to you
[49:31] and if they're raised up you know
[49:35] with the Lord Jesus
[49:37] and they're in their regular they're in
[49:40] a body you know because they're in a
[49:41] theophany body but that's the off the
[49:44] body people believe went into a
[49:46] resurrection and became a mortal body
[49:49] ain't gonna argue with you don't have
[49:51] time
[49:56] but when you get down to searching the
[49:58] scriptures
[50:01] then I could show on the other side that
[50:03] Jesus is the only one who has approached
[50:06] the immortality that's right right
[50:12] carnal reasoning then
[50:14] which we're not supposed to do right
[50:19] the Bible says come let us reason
[50:20] together
[50:24] when brother Branham went beyond the
[50:27] curtain of time
[50:30] he didn't see Abraham in them
[50:39] he didn't see Paul and Peter and all of
[50:42] them
[50:43] they want to saw his people
[50:46] so evidently worked brother running what
[50:48] too
[50:51] must have many many different sections
[50:54] or whatever you want to call it
[50:56] to that place or position
[51:00] all right we'll cover that more in a
[51:02] second
[51:05] let's see brother random on the message
[51:06] present stage of my Ministry go ahead
[51:08] and put up number nine brother
[51:13] he describes the dimensions we live in
[51:18] the third dimension life like matter
[51:21] all right fourth dimension is like
[51:22] television uh Etc movings Fifth
[51:26] Dimension is the center dead
[51:29] the sixth Dimension is where the
[51:31] Christians go
[51:35] the seventh Dimension is where God is
[51:37] now if you're reading it off of the
[51:39] thing the
[51:41] he's telling you that the message
[51:43] present stage of my Ministry
[51:45] all right
[51:49] and remember now that
[51:54] how high did Brother Brown go in those
[51:56] dimensions
[52:01] he only went to the sixth dimension
[52:07] according to the next quote go ahead and
[52:09] pull it up
[52:12] which is paragraph 390 of the fifth seal
[52:18] brother random when he went beyond the
[52:20] curtain of time
[52:22] he wanted to see Jesus
[52:26] he said you can't see him
[52:29] he said he's still higher
[52:33] are you reading it so you'll see him you
[52:37] can't see him now he's still higher
[52:40] all right
[52:41] now I did the Old Testament Saints
[52:44] precede any further than
[52:49] where we would be by
[52:51] passing on and going by the grave
[52:56] because run around as we gave you the
[52:58] quote before President stage of my
[53:00] Ministry he said Christians are in the
[53:03] sixth dimension
[53:05] all right she'll run around must have
[53:06] been in the sixth Dimension wanting to
[53:08] see Jesus and he said you can't see him
[53:10] because he's higher because he's in the
[53:12] Sabbath
[53:14] all right
[53:16] now
[53:17] what's the next scripture what's the
[53:19] scripture they could pull up
[53:21] go ahead
[53:23] First Timothy 6 16.
[53:28] who only speaking of Jesus Christ
[53:31] happy immortality
[53:35] immortality is mortal
[53:38] being that is made eternal is that a
[53:41] good definition
[53:43] a mortal person is made Eternal because
[53:46] if not you just say Eternal so when
[53:48] you're dealing with immortality you're
[53:50] dealing with
[53:51] Jesus Christ raised
[53:55] and the glorified
[53:57] Eternal mortal
[53:59] as we would call it that's to get to the
[54:02] point where you see flesh
[54:04] but it was immortality because it was
[54:06] eternal
[54:08] all right now you see if there are that
[54:10] who only had the mortality dwell in the
[54:12] Life which no man can approach unto
[54:16] whom no man has seen nor can see to whom
[54:20] the aren't bowed for Everlasting
[54:22] all right
[54:24] now we'll bring back that part after a
[54:26] while
[54:28] but just remember
[54:31] Those Old Testament Saints then when
[54:33] they went to Paradise
[54:36] Paradise went up
[54:40] and it became what we would call the
[54:42] sixth dimension
[54:44] because you can't put it in the field
[54:46] right right
[54:47] that's where people want to get their
[54:49] mathematics and run this out and the
[54:51] other that was hard to explain
[54:53] because it looked like it'd be better to
[54:54] put the Christians in The Fifth
[54:56] Dimension because the number five
[54:58] but it won't work because you got to put
[55:00] them right under the Altar and the five
[55:02] is where the center dead is at
[55:05] so you surely don't want them dark all
[55:07] right Follow Me Now
[55:11] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:14] remember that we covered Old Testament
[55:17] Saints
[55:18] they're in Paradise
[55:22] they're in the sixth dimension
[55:28] you said but now I differ we there
[55:30] that's all right you're different with
[55:31] me you know after a while you're going
[55:33] to see that if what you're saying is
[55:35] right it's gonna prove me right and it's
[55:36] what I'm saying is right's gonna prove
[55:37] me right so I ain't worried about it
[55:43] but the Bride of Jesus Christ as we've
[55:45] said before go ahead of belief in God
[55:51] not about a God or a thought
[55:54] but a real true belief in God
[55:59] when she dies she goes to sold under the
[56:01] altar not the one where they're crying
[56:03] how long how long no souls under the
[56:06] altar run around and used it
[56:10] they went into they go into the sixth
[56:11] Dimension which is the theophany
[56:15] which is the Heavenly Body
[56:17] which is the soul
[56:20] because your soul is your theophany
[56:23] all right
[56:25] I'm not going to stop and try to explain
[56:26] all this I've had 40 Years of doing it
[56:28] you weren't setting off it later we'll
[56:30] talk about it
[56:32] so that bride she has a place to go to
[56:34] the sixth dimension
[56:38] if you die you don't go right
[56:43] right
[56:50] you go into the sixth dimension
[56:53] the theophany the soul or the individual
[56:58] the word body theophany
[57:04] one two groups next group is the foolish
[57:07] virgin having a faith in God not all who
[57:11] claim I keep repeating that for each
[57:13] stage
[57:14] but those who have a true
[57:19] belief
[57:25] not all people are going to be foolish
[57:27] virgins
[57:30] right those with a real true belief
[57:33] but not a possession
[57:35] is that the difference is that according
[57:37] to Matthew 25 about the five wives and
[57:40] the five foolish at the five lives have
[57:43] four
[57:45] the other's lights are burning a little
[57:46] bit because when you read it today but
[57:48] it said our lives are gone out
[57:50] so they had enough justification and
[57:51] sanctification divide for a while but
[57:53] didn't have no wall in their lab which
[57:55] you didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[57:56] Ghost
[57:58] they have a place to go to if they die
[58:05] what dimension you gonna put them in
[58:09] I'm going to believe there are any
[58:11] section they're part of the
[58:14] sixth Dimension right
[58:16] where else you're gonna put them
[58:19] all right different section different
[58:22] parts whatever you want to call it
[58:24] trying to be sensible
[58:27] all right
[58:30] now the 144 000 in the two witnesses
[58:34] and put them both in the same point
[58:36] we'll divide it in a second
[58:39] but look what it says they have a belief
[58:41] in God
[58:43] they have a belief in Jesus Christ
[58:47] you know that your foolish virgin has a
[58:49] belief in Jesus Christ
[58:53] but those don't have the new birth to go
[58:55] with
[58:57] you know that all is in our mental
[58:59] capacity is a belief or faith or right
[59:03] but yet it still was enough of them to
[59:05] hold them and make them good people
[59:08] right police guards are good people they
[59:10] have a belief in God
[59:13] they have a place to go to
[59:15] but the others that are good people
[59:19] don't have a place to go to it
[59:21] you know they go to hell because they
[59:23] don't you got the two left now you you
[59:25] don't have a gray area
[59:27] all right now so with 144 000 and two
[59:31] witnesses
[59:33] they actually received
[59:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:39] eternal life in their soul here upon
[59:42] Earth
[59:43] but they rejected to ride a sunshield so
[59:46] they will not be in the bride and
[59:47] they'll only be servants that's right
[59:51] that's right always been the other way
[59:52] we'll get to it I mean it's all we're
[59:53] going to serve at Nation
[59:56] like Old Testament Israel
[1:00:01] their belief in God
[1:00:04] brings a reality to them because it's
[1:00:07] possible because Jesus Christ is now
[1:00:10] able to give them eternal life while
[1:00:13] here let
[1:00:15] eternal life they have to die right
[1:00:19] yeah 144 000 and the two and it said oh
[1:00:21] God according to the Bible
[1:00:24] and when they do they would have to go
[1:00:26] through the dimension of the sixth
[1:00:28] dimension
[1:00:29] which would be their soul their
[1:00:31] theophany
[1:00:32] their word body their being of what they
[1:00:35] have provided upon Earth
[1:00:38] all right
[1:00:40] number five is the fifth sealed Jew
[1:00:45] they don't have the testimony of Jesus
[1:00:47] Christ
[1:00:48] but they have the testimony they held
[1:00:52] right which is a belief in God
[1:00:56] knowing nothing about Jesus Christ
[1:01:02] but their belief in God
[1:01:05] provides them a place because run around
[1:01:08] said the field sealed Jewish killed from
[1:01:09] Calvary I'm down to here where we are
[1:01:12] they have a place to go to which is
[1:01:14] called sold under the altar
[1:01:16] and they can still cry how long
[1:01:21] because when they get there they don't
[1:01:23] have the white robe
[1:01:28] read your scripture it says white robes
[1:01:30] were given them
[1:01:31] they don't get the White Road when they
[1:01:33] die
[1:01:34] it would have to be given untrue it's
[1:01:36] going to be very valuable in a minute
[1:01:38] complete Plan of Redemption
[1:01:46] Ephesians 1 13 and 14 talks about that
[1:01:50] we're sealed
[1:01:52] and it gives us the earnest of our
[1:01:54] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:01:57] purchase product
[1:01:59] the complete Plan of Redemption
[1:02:03] okay
[1:02:06] one two now start number three
[1:02:10] first we deal with the Old Testament
[1:02:11] Saints
[1:02:14] they have a place that they went to they
[1:02:17] had a belief in God
[1:02:19] they had a place that they went to
[1:02:23] and it was called Paradise
[1:02:28] all right
[1:02:29] you say well you're just repeating I'd
[1:02:31] hold on a little bit now to listen on
[1:02:33] this one all right because this is I'm
[1:02:35] trying to be fast anyway
[1:02:38] they have a the Old Testament Saints had
[1:02:40] a place to go to provided by their faith
[1:02:44] in the Living God God provided them you
[1:02:47] know it's a better way of saying it keep
[1:02:49] people from thinking at you words God
[1:02:51] provided them a place by their faith
[1:02:54] they're believing
[1:02:55] that place was taken up one day
[1:02:59] and you can say well they raised up in
[1:03:01] glorified bodies
[1:03:03] well I'm just honest I don't believe
[1:03:05] they did
[1:03:07] yet I can give you quotes where run
[1:03:09] around and said they did
[1:03:13] but I can give you quotes where he says
[1:03:15] that their bodies are still waiting like
[1:03:16] you know that one day Abraham Adam was
[1:03:19] going to reach over and get eve and he's
[1:03:21] going to reach over again
[1:03:23] you know
[1:03:25] so there's no argument I'm not trying to
[1:03:28] argue because if you think that that
[1:03:30] they raised in glorified bodies you're
[1:03:33] going to give me a whole lot better
[1:03:34] opportunity to say what I want to say
[1:03:37] but I'm telling you what I believe
[1:03:41] well we don't care what you believe okay
[1:03:43] cut it off
[1:03:46] I'm just trying to make a complete Plan
[1:03:48] of Redemption to see if it fits yes
[1:03:50] all right
[1:03:52] me
[1:03:54] That Old Testament Saints
[1:03:58] when they raised
[1:04:03] they are now waiting on you and I
[1:04:08] all right
[1:04:11] remember now we're not talking about all
[1:04:13] the Old Testament Saints but those that
[1:04:15] are the prophet would call predestinated
[1:04:17] or chosen
[1:04:22] I believe that all predestinated ones
[1:04:26] their faith in God will provide them a
[1:04:29] place to go to
[1:04:32] that's what he's doing he's providing
[1:04:34] the place all right listen right
[1:04:38] there will be a group of people
[1:04:42] or was a group of people that raised
[1:04:44] back there
[1:04:47] I do not believe that the Old Testament
[1:04:49] Saints
[1:04:51] will have to be raised in the last days
[1:04:54] and go to the watch on judgment
[1:05:00] I do not believe that
[1:05:02] why because they already have their
[1:05:05] Resurrection within them it was made
[1:05:08] possible by Jesus Christ in his
[1:05:10] resurrection
[1:05:13] if they're raised why would you want to
[1:05:15] take them to judgment
[1:05:20] even though I don't believe they have
[1:05:22] been raised physically
[1:05:24] Corporal bodies mortal bodies
[1:05:27] I do believe that they've been brought
[1:05:29] to a position that they don't have to be
[1:05:31] judged
[1:05:32] right What a Wonderful Plan of
[1:05:34] Redemption
[1:05:36] amen there will be a group of people in
[1:05:39] the Old Testament that are not
[1:05:43] came with Jesus
[1:05:46] do they give you a quote right around
[1:05:47] and said all not all the Old Testament
[1:05:49] Saints raised
[1:05:53] those people that do not
[1:05:55] have their belief that are good people
[1:05:57] and we're Jews of doing
[1:06:01] they will have to be raised in the
[1:06:03] second resurrection and come to the
[1:06:06] watch on judgment
[1:06:08] now we're talking about
[1:06:11] not the people of the Old Testament who
[1:06:13] had their belief in God and it was
[1:06:15] correct and approved by raising
[1:06:17] they don't have to go
[1:06:18] to the bathroom
[1:06:21] they're already judged
[1:06:23] but a lot of those Old Testament science
[1:06:25] Old Testament people we call them
[1:06:28] they're gonna have to be judges one day
[1:06:30] and that'll be if you walk thrown so
[1:06:33] that's how careful I'm having to make it
[1:06:36] so if you differ with me it's all right
[1:06:40] you just pray for me
[1:06:46] Paradise was taken up
[1:06:50] we've covered that
[1:06:53] Matthew 27 52 talks about how that the
[1:06:56] Grays were open and many bodies were the
[1:06:58] Saints which slept arose and came
[1:07:03] out of the graves
[1:07:05] after his resurrection
[1:07:07] all right they went up
[1:07:13] there's three raptures in the Old
[1:07:15] Testament three and a new right
[1:07:18] the Old Testament you've got Enoch
[1:07:20] Elijah the Old Testament Saints
[1:07:23] New Testament you've got Jesus the bride
[1:07:26] of Christ
[1:07:28] and the two witnesses
[1:07:30] all right now
[1:07:32] in doing that then see they went up it's
[1:07:35] fulfilling Psalms 24 lift up your heads
[1:07:38] or lift up your Everlasting Gates they
[1:07:40] went up in a rapture
[1:07:48] they went up in a rapture
[1:07:51] they do not believe they'll have to be
[1:07:52] judged at the white Throne because
[1:07:54] they've raised up proving it
[1:07:57] all right
[1:08:01] were they raised in literal bodies
[1:08:05] did they go into their Dimension with
[1:08:07] Jesus
[1:08:09] when we just read the scriptures that
[1:08:11] nobody can do that he only had
[1:08:13] immortality
[1:08:16] but like I said I wrote this down if you
[1:08:20] want to argue the point you just wait
[1:08:21] just a minute
[1:08:23] then you're going to find out a little
[1:08:24] more that you might think that is a good
[1:08:26] point but I'm just telling you what I
[1:08:27] believe
[1:08:28] always ready for correction
[1:08:32] see the Old Testament Saints by being
[1:08:34] taken up
[1:08:36] they would have by impartation
[1:08:39] given unto them in their soul
[1:08:42] eternal life
[1:08:45] did you understand the wording by
[1:08:47] impartation they would receive eternal
[1:08:49] life
[1:08:50] all right and as they would then they
[1:08:53] would not have to be judged
[1:08:56] they don't have to stand it to watch
[1:08:58] their own judgment
[1:09:06] now here's one you may not have thought
[1:09:07] of
[1:09:09] I believe go to Old Testament saints
[1:09:11] that raise with Jesus
[1:09:16] will be in the millennial reign
[1:09:22] I have to change a lot of thoughts that
[1:09:24] I've had for 40 years
[1:09:28] still ain't worried too much about it
[1:09:32] they'll be in the millennial rain
[1:09:34] because the Millennium rain is going to
[1:09:35] be to Israel
[1:09:37] so there's got to be an Israel's effort
[1:09:39] to be too
[1:09:47] do they have eternal life and just step
[1:09:49] into the millennium
[1:09:54] but why not raise them up in the
[1:09:56] resurrection
[1:09:58] not the second Resurrection going to the
[1:10:01] judgment
[1:10:05] you say but they gave me a gave me an
[1:10:07] erection now we've got you you're you're
[1:10:09] saying wrong man
[1:10:11] because there's going to be a
[1:10:12] resurrection in a minute doesn't deal
[1:10:13] with white room it doesn't deal with any
[1:10:15] second Resurrection
[1:10:19] The Plan of Redemption
[1:10:22] all right
[1:10:27] in case you before you cut yourself off
[1:10:29] and do it remember there is a gospel to
[1:10:31] the Heathen and the Millennium has got
[1:10:32] to be raised
[1:10:35] that's according to your profit
[1:10:39] do they keep even turning the computer
[1:10:40] off
[1:10:44] see the millennial rain is actually
[1:10:46] promised to David
[1:10:53] that David would sit on the throne in
[1:10:56] the millennium
[1:10:59] you say not just his son
[1:11:04] Solomon said on a natural Throne Jesus
[1:11:07] Christ is the son of David we know that
[1:11:08] for sure but that's where he's coming
[1:11:10] forth in the Millennium is what
[1:11:12] son of David
[1:11:15] remember Son of God down the son of man
[1:11:18] then the crucified Son of God raised
[1:11:20] then the son of man back in the end
[1:11:22] times of the bride of Christ and then
[1:11:24] going to the son of David and the
[1:11:25] Millennium a promise to David all right
[1:11:29] now
[1:11:31] so we see that they don't have to go to
[1:11:33] the whites on judgment I don't believe
[1:11:34] you can put the Old Testament Saints at
[1:11:37] the white throne
[1:11:39] and I believe they'll be in the
[1:11:40] millennial Reign because it will be
[1:11:42] Israel as a nation in the morning right
[1:11:45] okay
[1:11:48] now I'll take number two the Bride of
[1:11:51] Jesus Christ
[1:11:53] she has a belief in God she has a place
[1:11:56] to go to her Redemption is in process
[1:12:00] she's here on Earth she received the new
[1:12:02] birth while living here
[1:12:04] the Old Testament Saints did not receive
[1:12:06] eternal life
[1:12:08] until they were raised
[1:12:12] but we get eternal life if we die we go
[1:12:16] to the sixth Dimension the theophany the
[1:12:19] soul
[1:12:22] eternal life
[1:12:23] one day in the resurrection that soul
[1:12:26] will come back right around said he'll
[1:12:27] release the soul that'll come to the
[1:12:29] spirit Spirit to the body and raise you
[1:12:31] back up and you'll stand up
[1:12:33] there's a group of people in there of
[1:12:36] the bride of Christ that does not have
[1:12:37] to die
[1:12:39] she'll be changed in a moment of
[1:12:40] twinkling of an eye so the bride doesn't
[1:12:43] in no way have to go to the watch on
[1:12:45] judgment
[1:12:48] will be changed here and make the Lord
[1:12:51] Jesus in the earth
[1:12:52] we go up to a marriage supper
[1:12:57] for three and a half years while he's
[1:12:58] speaking to Israel run around and said
[1:13:01] where was she after the supper he said
[1:13:03] she was in her father's house
[1:13:06] all right
[1:13:09] waiting for a time we come back into
[1:13:11] Millennial rain
[1:13:15] we don't have to go to the tribulation
[1:13:17] we don't have to go to the white Throne
[1:13:19] we come back into Millennial Ryan to
[1:13:21] rule and Reign for a thousand years
[1:13:24] all right
[1:13:26] foolish virgins
[1:13:28] remember I'm just moving up moving up
[1:13:32] we found that they have a belief
[1:13:37] but yet their belief is not as much as
[1:13:40] the bride because God can't birth them
[1:13:46] he birthed your belief
[1:13:48] that's why it's so important that you
[1:13:49] hear
[1:13:52] I hear they without preacher now you'll
[1:13:54] be preaching I said be sins
[1:13:56] you got to hear the truth of the new
[1:13:58] birth
[1:13:59] yeah but around said true prophets
[1:14:01] preach true verse false prophets brain
[1:14:03] false birth that's right foolish virgins
[1:14:08] she does not have eternal life while on
[1:14:11] Earth
[1:14:13] she goes to a six-dimensional form of
[1:14:17] holding
[1:14:20] she don't have eternal life
[1:14:24] she has to go to the white room
[1:14:26] and be judged
[1:14:28] for her beliefs and what she's done upon
[1:14:30] Earth and what's taking place
[1:14:34] they did not get eternal life so thereby
[1:14:36] they have to go
[1:14:38] to the watch on judgment
[1:14:40] they receive eternal life but to watch
[1:14:42] on judgment they missed the millennial
[1:14:44] reign
[1:14:47] laughs
[1:14:50] right
[1:14:51] they missed that
[1:14:53] but they'll come up at the future home
[1:14:57] with the Old Testament Saints it has to
[1:15:00] come to the white throne
[1:15:01] and be given eternal life I've divided
[1:15:04] that while ago now not the ones that
[1:15:07] rose with Jesus
[1:15:09] the ones that didn't raise with him will
[1:15:10] have to come up
[1:15:11] the watch only be judged
[1:15:14] that will be in the future home then the
[1:15:17] Nations that bring their honor and Glory
[1:15:20] into the city
[1:15:24] be the foolish virgins be the
[1:15:27] Old Testament Saints
[1:15:31] right
[1:15:32] the parts of Israel that don't need to
[1:15:34] be apart
[1:15:35] all right
[1:15:37] but they will have to go to the white
[1:15:38] Throne judgment to be judged and receive
[1:15:40] eternal life and adjustment
[1:15:43] that we don't want to be a foolish
[1:15:44] virgin
[1:15:47] independent upon that because we're
[1:15:49] going to miss the millennial rain
[1:15:53] we're going to miss A Thousand Years
[1:15:54] okay next group 144
[1:15:57] 000 are the and the two witnesses
[1:16:00] they receive eternal life in their soul
[1:16:03] here
[1:16:05] they're not bright
[1:16:07] because that's done been done away with
[1:16:08] nothing's been gone the bride's already
[1:16:11] been taken up
[1:16:13] that's like the the story of Joseph when
[1:16:16] he goes down into Egypt
[1:16:19] and he gets a wife from a gentile house
[1:16:24] his brothers come down
[1:16:27] they're going to be in the millennium
[1:16:30] but they're not going to be the bride
[1:16:32] hey man all right 144
[1:16:35] 000 and the two witnesses
[1:16:39] the two witnesses will raise in a
[1:16:41] rapture
[1:16:43] that's the only one you've got
[1:16:47] you don't have any listing for the 144
[1:16:49] 000 to be raised in a rapture
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] so why don't you let them be raised to
[1:16:57] go into the millennium
[1:16:59] I just got through proving that on tape
[1:17:01] over and over to you whether you
[1:17:02] listened or not
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:05] cover that in a second
[1:17:08] Israel has always been
[1:17:11] paragraph 196 sealed God's servant
[1:17:15] Nation
[1:17:18] that 144 thousand
[1:17:23] the prophet said
[1:17:26] page 41 Church age book you want to pull
[1:17:29] that up number 11.
[1:17:32] that 144 000 will be in the millennial
[1:17:35] rain
[1:17:38] what your profit says
[1:17:42] 144 000 will be in the millennial reign
[1:17:47] we just got through covering Daniel 70
[1:17:49] weeks of different things
[1:17:53] and you can see
[1:17:55] they don't have to go to the white
[1:17:57] throne
[1:18:01] the white Throne is after the millennium
[1:18:05] those who go into the Millennium will
[1:18:07] buy past the white throne
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:12] but in the Millennium there's going to
[1:18:14] be
[1:18:14] two different groups
[1:18:16] there's going to be a Jew
[1:18:19] and there's going to be a heathen
[1:18:26] he deals with 144 000 as the tribes of
[1:18:29] Israel
[1:18:31] but in Ezekiel 48 you find right around
[1:18:34] putting the tribes back together and
[1:18:37] making 13 we just covered that right
[1:18:41] Dan and Ephraim is taken out according
[1:18:43] to revelation 7.
[1:18:47] but really Ephraim is not even counted
[1:18:50] in Revelation 7 I showed you that
[1:18:53] Dan is taking out Manassas has put into
[1:18:56] revelation 7.
[1:18:58] Ephraim
[1:19:01] an Ephraim is later removed
[1:19:04] because of his him and Dan going after
[1:19:06] the golden cage
[1:19:09] all right but in the Millennium Ephraim
[1:19:11] and Dan are put back in back to original
[1:19:13] 13 tribes that should have been
[1:19:16] will they leave out in the middle
[1:19:19] and Joseph not having a tribe on quoting
[1:19:22] right around come on
[1:19:23] Joseph's not having a tribe
[1:19:26] it's the end of Millennium then
[1:19:28] you're going to have a hundred and forty
[1:19:31] four thousand Jews
[1:19:34] into that quote plus twenty four
[1:19:37] thousand
[1:19:40] because you got 13 tribes in the
[1:19:42] millennium
[1:19:44] the way God wanted it in the beginning
[1:19:46] you only have 12 sons of Jacob
[1:19:54] Dan and Ephraim is removed from the
[1:19:56] records of of they're not not deleted as
[1:19:59] tribes they went right on down through
[1:20:00] there with God in his
[1:20:03] Providence and Revelations removed from
[1:20:08] but they'll be put back in
[1:20:10] because they're going to be purged
[1:20:12] right the brother random I gave you the
[1:20:15] quote where he said those tribes will be
[1:20:17] put right in that tribulation for
[1:20:19] purging with the foolish virgin that's
[1:20:21] right right
[1:20:24] so the 144 000 will be purged and the 24
[1:20:28] 000 will be purged in the tribulation
[1:20:32] no record that they go up in a Rapture
[1:20:34] but they're in the millennium
[1:20:38] so they must be raised from the dead
[1:20:44] but to go
[1:20:46] to the Millennium right
[1:20:51] all right
[1:20:52] Joy there's things going to happen that
[1:20:54] you and I haven't considered
[1:20:58] right right amen
[1:21:03] so now we've picked up a few more going
[1:21:05] into the millennium
[1:21:07] now the next group of people that we
[1:21:09] deal with is the fifth seal Jew
[1:21:14] those who the Bible said that they
[1:21:19] were given hot rolls
[1:21:23] and the day we'll have to wait until
[1:21:25] their Brethren are killed above the
[1:21:27] Bible
[1:21:28] Phil
[1:21:30] all right
[1:21:32] so that group of people can raise and go
[1:21:34] into millennium
[1:21:38] well because they receive white rose
[1:21:41] they don't have to go to the watch on
[1:21:42] judgment
[1:21:45] if you're following me and can't keep up
[1:21:47] with number wise then keep up with one
[1:21:49] thing only the foolish virgins will be
[1:21:52] going to the white throne
[1:21:54] and the people of Israel that does not
[1:21:57] raise when Jesus raised
[1:22:00] to where you'll have the people that are
[1:22:03] to have Nations coming up later
[1:22:08] they're giving white robes white robes
[1:22:10] is eternal life
[1:22:11] they don't have to go this this fifth
[1:22:14] sealed Jew they don't have to go to the
[1:22:15] white Throne to get white rose
[1:22:17] they have it and they go right into the
[1:22:19] Millennium right
[1:22:21] because the Millennium is to Israel
[1:22:25] we're just now on the honeymoon folks
[1:22:29] we're just our own honeymoon
[1:22:32] thousand year honeymoon but we can rule
[1:22:34] and reign
[1:22:36] you say well I don't know about all this
[1:22:37] Resurrection
[1:22:40] well
[1:22:44] put number 12 brother
[1:22:47] this is when people hadn't looked at too
[1:22:49] much
[1:22:51] look number 12. look at that question
[1:22:54] and answer 62 527 paragraph 177. then
[1:22:57] it's return of Christ and the bride the
[1:22:59] bride the church in the bride
[1:23:02] the bride of Christ shall walk out upon
[1:23:05] their ashes in the Millennium when the
[1:23:07] earth is purified by fire and there they
[1:23:09] shall reign watch
[1:23:12] the Heathen bats never heard the gospel
[1:23:16] shall be raised in that time
[1:23:21] and the sons of God will be manifested
[1:23:27] if you're going to have read on down if
[1:23:30] you're going to rule you've got to have
[1:23:32] something to rule over
[1:23:33] we're going to rule and Reign for a
[1:23:35] thousand years but around and said the
[1:23:38] what now he didn't say everybody see
[1:23:41] he stipulates and the Heathen that's
[1:23:44] never heard the gospel
[1:23:48] God is a just God
[1:23:52] he knows whether or not you've ever
[1:23:54] heard about him right so he doesn't
[1:23:56] judge you and send you to hell
[1:23:59] the Millennium is going to be a pretty
[1:24:01] crowded place
[1:24:04] it's gonna be a wonderful time
[1:24:11] foolish virgins they miss that
[1:24:16] all those Old Testament Jews and things
[1:24:19] they miss it that does not come up with
[1:24:21] Jesus I keep stating that where you make
[1:24:23] sure he can't get it wrong
[1:24:26] but what about a heathen Brother Gary
[1:24:28] that God
[1:24:31] will judge him according to his laws and
[1:24:35] I'll give you quotes for that
[1:24:37] he'll be judged according to how he
[1:24:39] lived
[1:24:42] but if he never heard about Jesus Christ
[1:24:44] he's not going to be thrown in hell
[1:24:47] he's going to have a millennial reign
[1:24:50] that we can preach to it
[1:24:53] what happens to them I don't know
[1:24:56] you're down to a point I said I don't
[1:24:58] know maybe one of these days I'll tell
[1:24:59] you what happened to them
[1:25:00] I don't know I've told you many times I
[1:25:03] don't know
[1:25:07] but the heater is going to be raised
[1:25:12] those who never heard of Jesus Christ
[1:25:16] a complete Plan of Redemption for all
[1:25:19] five different groups of peoples
[1:25:22] Old Testament Saints
[1:25:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:28] foolish virgins
[1:25:31] 24 000 which would put the two witness
[1:25:33] in with them
[1:25:34] in the field sealed you
[1:25:36] because of their belief
[1:25:40] they have a place
[1:25:42] they're allowed to go into heaven
[1:25:49] because of their belief
[1:25:56] but in the Gentile dispensation just
[1:25:58] remember for you and I to reject the
[1:26:00] gospel in this dispensation we go to
[1:26:02] hell
[1:26:06] ain't no hope being raised as foolish
[1:26:08] virgins coming out somewhere else ain't
[1:26:11] no hopes of being raised in the
[1:26:12] Millennium but either even though we are
[1:26:16] pretty well either
[1:26:18] you know what my definition of the
[1:26:20] heater is
[1:26:23] your definition of a heater and is a
[1:26:25] mean bad honorary old guy that don't
[1:26:27] believe in God
[1:26:31] right
[1:26:34] someone who's never heard is out of the
[1:26:36] other be your definition you know what
[1:26:37] my definition of an Ethernet
[1:26:41] this group of preachers that's in this
[1:26:42] message that's perverting the things
[1:26:45] right around them
[1:26:53] that's the worst Hedonism could ever be
[1:26:55] for you and I
[1:26:58] to reject this message that we've heard
[1:27:00] that's right amen and go on believe in
[1:27:04] our trinitarian thoughts and ideas and
[1:27:07] not falling after the word of God
[1:27:11] that's the heathen
[1:27:15] I remember listening to it or getting a
[1:27:17] tape one time they said invasion of the
[1:27:19] U.S and I thought man I'm going to find
[1:27:21] out about Russia coming down China's
[1:27:23] coming down this is coming here that
[1:27:24] one's coming here it's gonna be like
[1:27:25] like it was for Hitler more they're
[1:27:27] going to get over here and I put that
[1:27:29] tape on and all this
[1:27:34] you know what I talked about
[1:27:36] Catholicism
[1:27:38] captivating the mind of America that's
[1:27:42] brought us all down we're all going to
[1:27:45] happen
[1:27:47] we're all good people we're all
[1:27:51] Christians you know
[1:27:55] invasion of the U.S
[1:28:02] that's what shook us down there that's
[1:28:04] right
[1:28:06] and I hope you understand what I was
[1:28:07] saying at the end because to me either
[1:28:10] is a person that's closest to the truth
[1:28:12] but yet uses that truth to pervert it
[1:28:15] that's right to try to pervert the minds
[1:28:17] of people
[1:28:19] that's right and say brother random was
[1:28:21] wrong here and Jesus was wrong guard and
[1:28:23] Jesus done wrong he brought around done
[1:28:25] wrong
[1:28:31] what about the Plan of Redemption
[1:28:36] complete Redemption because one day
[1:28:39] because
[1:28:41] that you could go by the grave
[1:28:45] and be raised
[1:28:48] you could go down mortal corruptable
[1:28:52] and be raised up incorruptable amen
[1:28:57] and for the fact that Jesus Christ
[1:29:00] watched this world in the days of Noah
[1:29:02] and then in his day he dropped his blood
[1:29:05] upon this Earth to cleanse and claim it
[1:29:09] and he claimed our bodies because our
[1:29:11] bodies was laying right there then
[1:29:13] that's right so these bodies had already
[1:29:15] claimed to prove it is to give you the
[1:29:17] new birth you're not going to get a new
[1:29:19] body
[1:29:21] there ain't no such thing in the Bible
[1:29:24] Jesus raised with nail prints in his
[1:29:27] hands
[1:29:28] now you won't talk about getting a new
[1:29:30] body
[1:29:33] and Jesus is going to be there when they
[1:29:35] are prince in his hands showing he paid
[1:29:36] the price right right amen
[1:29:39] you see what I'm saying the people of
[1:29:41] this message are how they perverted the
[1:29:43] message
[1:29:46] the message is perfect
[1:29:48] now they're arguing that the messenger
[1:29:51] is not infallible I agree with you
[1:29:55] but the message is infallible
[1:29:57] now you agree with me on that one
[1:30:01] I agree that Brett around had mistakes
[1:30:03] was a human being a moral person yeah
[1:30:06] right but now you agree that the message
[1:30:08] is right then you'll shut up your dirty
[1:30:10] stinking stuff
[1:30:12] but you see because you and I were
[1:30:15] raised if I die I'll raise because I got
[1:30:18] the resurrection inside of me then this
[1:30:20] world is going to have to have a
[1:30:23] Redemptive plan
[1:30:27] this world is going to have to be
[1:30:29] redeemed right
[1:30:31] we just step ahead of it I believe
[1:30:35] that's 49 future home we step ahead of
[1:30:37] the World Cup and we go into glorified
[1:30:40] bodies right here
[1:30:41] but
[1:30:45] what about a Plan of Redemption
[1:30:47] that we cannot leave anybody out
[1:30:52] put them in the right place
[1:30:56] thank God for the truth
[1:31:01] you might have any
[1:31:02] we're going to go eat together have a
[1:31:05] good time fellowshipping
[1:31:07] and I hope you'll just sit down if you
[1:31:09] don't listen if you can't you're enough
[1:31:11] I know it's hard because the the seat
[1:31:13] has problems sitting on the Pew and the
[1:31:16] mine has problems cause a CPAP problem
[1:31:18] and when you do you don't listen too
[1:31:20] good
[1:31:21] go back and listen again over and over
[1:31:24] I've tried to place each group
[1:31:28] even to now believing that the 144 000
[1:31:31] the the people will be raised to go into
[1:31:33] the Millennium the heat are going to be
[1:31:35] raised to go into the millennium
[1:31:38] Israel can be raised to go into the
[1:31:40] millennium
[1:31:42] he ain't for goddess people
[1:31:47] he ain't forgot his people
[1:31:51] they're going to be there that's right
[1:31:54] I may have to go through a lot of things
[1:31:56] in the purgings and different things
[1:31:57] with they're going to be there not all
[1:32:00] of them why because not all of them has
[1:32:03] that belief in God
[1:32:04] let's stand together
[1:32:06] not all of them can claim a belief in an
[1:32:10] eternal God
[1:32:13] what about a group of people a heathen
[1:32:16] that will be given an opportunity
[1:32:22] and raised up in the millennium
[1:32:31] these days we'll understand why it says
[1:32:33] it in the Millennials that are Center or
[1:32:35] die curse but a child who died 100 or
[1:32:37] something like that in the scripture
[1:32:39] I don't understand that
[1:32:42] I'm just beginning to understand the
[1:32:44] Plan of Redemption
[1:32:47] that way everybody's got a place
[1:32:52] you know what I like but my brother said
[1:32:55] one time he said I know I'm going to be
[1:32:57] there going to run around and saw me
[1:32:58] there
[1:33:01] this other brother said well I'd be
[1:33:03] careful brother because he is in both
[1:33:04] places right
[1:33:09] is that what he say did you say he went
[1:33:11] to hell did you say he went to the six
[1:33:14] Dimension Children of the honor in both
[1:33:16] places
[1:33:18] might have seen all of us there
[1:33:19] somewhere
[1:33:22] what about your salvation
[1:33:26] number one you got to have a belief in
[1:33:28] that God is real
[1:33:32] not just imagination or thought but a
[1:33:35] real God
[1:33:38] and then he can bring us out of and into
[1:33:41] because that's the whole story
[1:33:43] of redemption what we got 266 inspirable
[1:33:48] we're going same just a little bit
[1:33:50] because a lot of the sisters have done
[1:33:52] went downstairs to get everything ready
[1:33:54] so let's just worship and have a good
[1:33:56] time
[1:34:08] okay
[1:34:12] thank God
[1:35:21] I
[1:35:33] like
[1:36:10] ain't running back
[1:37:23] foreign
[1:38:38] to clear up
[1:38:42] you crazy
[1:40:02] foreign
[1:40:41] ly thank you
[1:40:43] we love you and we just come to an end
[1:40:46] of a service and a time that we try to
[1:40:48] explain a little bit about Redemption
[1:40:50] many said some things we hadn't said
[1:40:52] before and plain and blunt to say them
[1:40:56] but we just say what we believe one
[1:40:58] little bit we can see for the time we
[1:41:00] just keep progressing and gradually
[1:41:02] gaining a little bit of
[1:41:04] because if you give it all to us you'll
[1:41:06] probably said it one time we wouldn't be
[1:41:07] able to stand it so we just thank you we
[1:41:10] love you
[1:41:11] we ask you to go with us now as we go
[1:41:14] eat a natural meal
[1:41:16] the father we ask you to sanctify the
[1:41:18] food that each one of our bodies that we
[1:41:20] may all mean what you want us to be and
[1:41:22] be healthy and
[1:41:25] be letting you sanctify the food and the
[1:41:28] partakers
[1:41:30] amen you just need to know
[1:41:40] foreign
[1:42:26] everything
[1:42:38] is perfect
