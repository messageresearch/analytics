your grace and love be there we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen we're going to Ephesians that we've been reading so far by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of God now let's go over to Matthew 12:43 when the unclean spirit is going out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and find us none then he said I will return to my house remember that now last Sunday we were talking about it or Wednesday I'll return to my house you know all right from Wis I came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished now look at them it's a clean houses everything's in order then goeth he and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the life state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also this is a wicked generation you may be seated the Lord that is with blessings to the word Amen now I was thinking about something yesterday and reading a little bit time of studying in things and thinking about what the Prophet said you remember he was telling about the preacher that that come in and started preaching and he just kept preaching on sin repentance sin you know kept preaching on that and so they finally told him you know we're asked him said we've enjoyed it and always said you know when you're gonna get all the he said when everybody repents well I'll get off the new birth when everybody gets the new birth and that's that's the way that I am I'm sorry if you don't like my ways and think I just I don't like them either when I tried to abide in God's Word and we just keep on keep on until we see God move on the scene in all things okay now we've been talking about salvation been talking about salvation in stages or steps you know our manifestations or whatever you want to call it and the Prophet said there's three steps to grace all right and they asked him the question on the questions and answers was it necessary that everybody how those three stages he says yes he said to be borned again you must have the three stages all right if you get offended let me keep on going and over and over I simply asked you a question we're talking about in stages have you been through stage one of the new birth well I'm trying to get it to a point and trying to make it as simple as I can for you to understand see if you would take what I'm saying and listen to it instead of trying to figure Wow and I don't like this not like that he could be doing this it was a you know if you just listen to what I've been trying to say you might find out that you know for certain that you've been through stage one of the new birth I'm not trying to diss discredit anybody or throw anybody out or anything I've been trying to tell you what takes place at these stages all right Stage one is what justification chopping off your pie sins well you know the day that you went to the altar you asked God to forgive you you accepted him as your Savior you know then you're talking about justification all right then that's not a hard thing to follow it's not something to degrade you it's something to lift you up and let you know what I told you I said now we've asked in the question over and over on stage one justification have you experienced an actual part of your birth in the new birth that we would call stage one justification have you experienced that that's all I've asked it you know I've asked you have you you had an experience because I believe you must have an experience well I got it all at one time well I'm not arguing with nobody I believe that can take place I've preached that to you but the Prophet said very few people would believe all the way to receiving the baptism when the old ago he didn't say where did it be at one place or ten places he just said very few people would believe all the way to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost well now I try my best to get you to understand without like I said without Turing you down to her ass in well he don't believe I've got anything you don't brother Dale don't believe out and he don't believe I've got it if that's not for me that's between you and God that has nothing to do between you and your wife or your husband or your neighbor you past her hood it is between you and God you've got to settle this between you and him not try to bring anybody else in well brother so-and-so told me I've I've told you before about it when we came to the altar one time it was three of us I remember praying for the baptism when the Holy Ghost well this one brother they don't call his name but after it was done he said I believe all three of you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost right to her denial well both of those brothers years later told me that their experience was that that brother told them that he had was that they he believed they had received the old ago well you know what he prayed the same prayer over me but I didn't believe it because I'm like that little boy and said nothing happened well I'm not gonna tell something that did happen but see was there experience based upon what somebody else said are up on what they were having to say what is your experience all right now is we're going to go over into stage two in parts of what we're talking about today then remember we're going to ask that same question have you experienced sanctification have you had an experience in your life of an actual work or what everyone call it stage or whatever of sanctification to be in cleanse and set aside for service because you can't bypass any of it and come out to say you got the baptism with all to go he's right I just brother Dale I just I've never been taught nothing else and I didn't know you know now all right but listening to the prophets message you ought to know listening to him because he's I've asked you to read the future home and just to study the message he was explaining the new birth but I also know the story that went with that some of you do are you hurt it that brother said that they brought around him ask him did he understand the Futurama he said first said yes then he said do you under he said no and understand well see the Prophet says in the message the future home he said if you don't get nothing out of this get the new birth why he was explaining the new borough now he says don't Christ Christ in history what is the new birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you revealing himself to you all right when he gets to the future home what does he do he breaks down the stages of the new birth well if you've never had these stages is it me that's saying that it's wrong if I say if you never had an experience then you don't know what it is so you needed experience well I just believed in everything well that's all right but are you putting your whole life on something you believe or something somebody told you would I have brother della I've got the new birth and I can't doubt it whatsoever it is never done better Brenham told you it is daughter-in-law Louis receive the Holy Ghost one night and the next night she's down yeah that's what I say I hate to say things to people when I know that your mind is set on certain things and you won't accept that and believe it but if I tell you that then don't worry about it when we get to judgment and you say white throne no I don't intend to go to white throne may be sitting on the white throne but I don't intend for me and you that's what I'm trying to do now is keep us away from the white throne I'm trying to get us born again is that all right trying to get us truly born again till we know because see the new birth your starts it I mean once we get to the new birth we've got to go through the adoption all stages we've got to go through all of the journeys of a Christian we got a long ways to go but you're talking about the new birth and how simple it is to understand all right now we read these so let's put it back up I want to keep these before you because you know at least you'll understand the Prophet is the one that said it go ahead with number one because we're talking about the new birth in stages you know being born again which deals with you getting born again it deals with you after you're born to him see it never stops so the new birth will never stop uh-huh no one's from the future home he says now the first step is repentance towards God then follows after that is water baptism what a baptism repent be baptized the name of Jesus Christ water baptism followers showing that your repentance was genuine are to remit our PI sins than once that has nothing to do with future sin yes you could be justified truly it has nothing to do with the future it's repentance of your sins so all you've done at justification it's chopped off your PI since that's what he's saying there's nothing to do with your future sin it only remit repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission taking away of Pi sins has nothing to do with the future the what just your sins has been chopped off what you did you don't repent for Adam and things like that look the old nature is still dire now I didn't say that do you say what brother Dale my old nature went out when I repented well then you're talking to the Prophet not to me you can get upset with me you know you think you can do that but just remember if I tell you what he said and you get upset with me for saying what he said that's the same as getting upset with him because he's won said it okay or if not let's stir up the message go home eat drink and be merry because tomorrow we die and we prove we don't have a new birth there are life that we're living is proof of the birth so then we went through trying to cover their Wednesday night justification chops off your pie sins has nothing to do with the future it only reveals the past we don't believe in the Catholic doctrine of that big old word further that you can go in and pay somebody to you know remix your sins before they ever sin we don't believe in that that won't work so it's only for the pice sins all right yeah it does nothing he said to your nature okay so we draw it out and took a little drawing of trying to help you to understand so go ahead brothers and well look we'll leave it on paragraph 89 reined up lady now one more okay he took a board he draw it out too harsh and he said now this is a human heart and this is the mtar okay he says here's a human heart here's a human heart this one over here has a snake in it that's in here he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is all this period here he has a life so now you have a lot your life is what you are your life is your soul of your being right no that's why we're gonna get to it in just a minute with the anointed ones so hold on to your point your life is your soul no it's a life I live and that life ought to be lived by the soul which ought to be by Christ all right so now think about what he's saying well it's the one here has malice Envy that's what's causing it this fella here well fellas call isn't it the snake that we'll get to in a second yes but I don't like that because you you keep bringing it out there that we've born with a snake you're gonna talk to the Prophet go talk to him he said that's it the Bible says it that that unclean spirit is their brother branham calls it the unclean spirit he called it the root of evil but it actually no scripture that says a root of evil goes out whatever yeah there's it does about the root of of the fact of you lusting after this or listen but it not it doesn't use that terminology then they look this one over here at Lovejoy longsuffering that's what does it down here what causes from the inside right it's easy to see the dove is inside but the only question I got to ask you how did the dog get inside is that simple enough how did it get inside well I'd born with it I'd born this seed I'd want eternal life see the Bible says was born in sin save it in iniquity spouse my mother's wound and go forth a ladder okay no look he said when your ass you're forgiven of your sins you only done this now that's justification right you've asked you repented of your sins taken that away now watch but the thing that made you do it is still hurt taken what away takes away the sin of the soul salvation is not in your body salvation is not in your spirit the moon we're gonna get an anointing ones in a minute so the I hope you follow that salvation is in the soul of mankind your body displays what's your spirit is your spirit displays what your soul is right okay so you're not born again in your body you're not more to get in your spirit you're born again in your soul now that's the soul he's describing when he draws a heart right because the Bible talks about the heart what is the probably Toma the soul of an individual the heart so what's now then when you ask your repented or you're forgiven your sins you only did this taken that away now we'll show that on the drawing you take out the sin why but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still dark but brother Dale I remember when I went to the altar and asked God to forgive me and I felt this load come off of me Amy and I believe in that that's what I said you might find out you're further up the road then what you think I'm trying to make you you think I'm trying to degrade you pull you down to some Lowe's case I'm trying to tell you right where we're staying and what we're standing on that was you repent and are baptized the name of Jesus Christ for your sins okay no look no sanctification cleanse and said it's not but now go ahead now let's go with her drawing okay whoever number three brother now the profit draw to heart okay he said well he didn't draw it like you didn't draw a snake like that either but the soul of an individual code we're all born in sin according to Roman's 3 I mean 3:23 we're born in sin so when we get that settled that we're all were born kinfolks to the devil because even the book of ruth declares out that there was one more kinfolks to us than jesus christ all right see then we were born in sin you say yeah but what about all this see don't I just see to see didn't me always was eternal well if you always was eternal you don't need eternal life may I ask you the question why did Jesus have to die why did Jesus have to die he always was eternal you see that's what tears it up that's what people don't like is because our stations say stuff like that instead of patting you on the back because he ain't trying to get your billfold I'm trying to get down where we all leave her all the soul those David Clyde out in his soul right trying to get us to see what's going on what did the Prophet say he draw the drawing he said no this and though here's got a snake in it he said in here he puts in in it he's he drawed it out to show you how that you're born in sin all right now what happens at justification go to the next one now number four but I remember that remember the pointer back over here this one that sin remember what he said over here these were the things in here and remember what he said the sin is what goes out at justification he said what's causing you you're still tired now here we go we try to put a faith in here to replace sin that's just happened that's men brother Joe trying to help you to understand cause brother Joe come up with a point of putting it into faith all right that's not faith it's faith trying to hold the place of where Satan had been cast out know that see him because it's gone out by the blood of Jesus Christ right justification is based upon the blood of Jesus Christ the forgiving us in i but he said the thing that made you do it is still dark I've always just been told all I had to do is was accept Jesus Christ as my savior then you want to take the future home book and tear it up throw it away because the problem is gonna be is we're gonna get more books and then we're going to tell you that nothing throw it away then we go get more books with my entire first thing you know England how new books I thought we believe the Prophet I don't care what you think I hope you don't care what I think it's what that prophet had to say cuz the Prophet told us what the Bible say the Bible says all born in sin house in a mother's womb a liar lost doomed and on the way to hell yeah but I've got where the Prophet said that's what I mean so you're gonna fight with me over quotes lingo finally I've been through all of that I know what you probably said he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal now where's your body eternal you ain't got there yet was you stole a spirit eternal the five senses of the second part reason no because that's still in sin there's only one place that God is dealing and that's the soul of mankind so you're not born again nowheres else than that let's see you repent of your sins you get rid of your sin you start trying to live right you remember that you remember when you first repented you went to the altar you cried out you asked God to forgive you that's wonderful that's part of God's Word see if we didn't oh this mystery but the snake was still there all right we didn't know that we wasn't taught that the churches didn't teach us about the snake being loved they know anything about it didn't know hat one out or what happened to it they'll move it on up this gets itchy Savoy scratch we're in the message have you ever heard much talk about justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost number two were have you ever heard that the Prophet said it is required that you go through these stages I'm asking you seriously you ever heard evil oh yeah we preach don't just yell but yeah we believe justification we believe you just gave chops off a sin we believe it within what happens you see you said well you ain't no to your business I'm the pastor that makes it my business if you don't like the faster you go get you another one and fool with his business because the pastor is supposed to tell us what the Prophet said and if he don't give you another one is that simple enough or go somewheres ours that's nobody's tried to make no Lula eyes out of this thing we've got enough problems as it is with our human selves we see your prophet said even though sin had went out of your soul now this is the one saying get it he's not talking about sin going out of your body your body came sin without your spirit and your spirit is motivated by the soul that's within you right so salvation is not in the body and spirit I saw you hearing the message now it's got away from advice twenty years kind of but you know what I'm talking about you that was our back by thirty forty years oh you had man say at one certain brother I don't do TOMS shoes when somebody preached against two songs you yeah that's a wonderful ended these people come in from this one church and his brother had always preached and it always preached and he preached about these tent dresses but always against this this no he preached their heart and I I'm dumb enough this but I'm still like ask questions I asked my wife I said what is the tent dress but I don't know what they are do you can you tell me what they are she said yeah they're kind of like a thing that gathers up into here seem describe the rest of if I miss it let's forget it something about that and it will goes down this way you know in spreads out it's like a pen I guess well I said well honey I said uh would you show me one thing to get dresses where I could see she said yeah says runner without of the offer you know who she's pointing out the sisters that had come with that brother that priest against the tent dresses well why didn't he preach it in his own church was it okay for him to move the Trant dresses over here come on you think I'm silly well I'm not things that had happened down through time that some of you are old enough to remember the what it was told is your wife worthy of the gospel you know that's a direct quote out of the message is your life worthy the gospel is that right well read it is your life worth it oh gosh let's see that's well that's what I'd say we get two women straightened out we'd be ready to go well I didn't okay no but listen take out sin try to keep it out by faith you know the word being revealed to you try to keep it out of there by faith coz you're placing everything gonna fight but the thing that makes you do it is still dark now how you gonna get that out of there how are you gonna get that out because the Bible says the unclean spirit is going out of man walking he said I'll go back now did you notice I read it Sunday our Wednesday already this minute ago he said I'll go back to my house that's in the Book of Luke - well it's Matthew I'll go back to my house whose house is he talking about where's the house he's talking about right here Satan's house our domain is what we were born into I don't care if you the prophets son I wouldn't care to say that to brother Branham or say it to brother around I'm not do grading nobody brother Branham is the one that said if that demon hadn't been married 12 years old he got born again earlier now he's the one that said you know you think I'm against the insert out of the other you ought to be careful I'm very careful what I say because I'm going to answer but I know twos I'm allowed to answer for your soul so you ain't gonna stand there white throne or the judgment of Deeds in the done in the body of the D we have a judgment we got two places one of them is deciding to whether to go into eternal life the other one is not that the other ones are rewards a different thing you got two judgments all right we're gonna stand down and we're gonna give an account well what's it gonna be with the poro preachers it's not told the truth what's it gonna be all right what you see now let me describe this as a second point just a thought now you remember when you repented of your sins we're back up to that other draw one that has sinned then all right there you go they got this sin is what went out at justification when we repented now you can't put eternal life in there now come on folks wake up you can't put eternal life with this old boy in the middle that unclean spirits in there there's not eternal life there come on let's see this sin goes out but it does nothing to nature now how do you get beyond clean spirit out there's not but one way to handle anything in Christ and that's through faith in his word sanctification is the compound word cleanse and set aside all right now the unclean spirit goes out that's sanctification are the root of evil will go out at sanctification week I'll show the next one will show now go to the next one see that's what you wind up with even if you can get the sin out even if you can get the snake out the root of evil what have you got you're a perfect target for the devil to come back that's what the scripture says and it's seven times worse now may I quote the Prophet what Brian what was those demons come back with basically religious demons right may I say it preachers because the Bible says that Satan has ministers and they're as ministers of righteousness that's the devil's preachers so it's not trying to get you to come back to the alternate would you come to the altar and you repent alright you start you do pretty good for a little while and the first thing you know things starts easing back in you you don't remember being that I lift my life I don't I don't know what you gonna do with it but that sin can be chopped off but what caused you to do it that snake sure he's out of there he's clean all is wonderful yes what a marvelous place to stay is to say to say a place that you could say it's clean you could say I've repented to God I've asked him to forgive me and he has forgiven me now I'm asking you again the question have you ever asked God to sanctify you well I didn't know I needed to you do now let's title this message you do now all right because you hearing it well I don't believe it cause you saying it well that's all right you gonna talk to God about 10 things I don't have to worry about it I'm just trying to tell you what the word says will solve the whole problems are you go ahead and do what you want to but look what a beautiful place to be is to be wonderfully clean to be to the point that sin cannot rule you you know yourself the Prophet and what he say it the do you sin he said every day so he's not talking about none sinners this is not none sinners oh you know no it's not nonsense it's clean sinners the centers that have been cleansed of their sin called sanctification is a cleanse and setting aside because that's where the unclean spirit goes out at its sanctification now the new burqa I don't know don't put that new birth hold on now do we get the message in a minute all right when you back up to see that that you you've got rid of sin but you still got the snake now you got rid of the snake okay we're a wonderful shape we're doing good but just remember you ain't got to dove the Dove ain't in there whatever the doves what throating on the dogwood wardrobe snake how there's were the problems that that's what you think it is you think the holy ghost come in and robots a snake you're too far ahead you gotta wait to get to that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire will clean out anything that's left but here's where we're at now listen you're standing there perfectly clean sanctified what kind of nature have you got you may have gotten rid of the snake as the nature part but what kind of a nature part do we all have come along brother there loves to preach when you get quiet because even your sleep or your listening listen if you could think for a minute about these kids you realize that kid when it's born is not born with a snake come on he's not born with all these demons in it you know where the demons come from Mama and Daddy oh you don't like that one living all do you I raised my kids best I could I didn't I'm saying you didn't we just tried our best to do the best we could maybe that's the better way of saying it we tried but I'm asking you here's a little baby to describe it that way that unclean spirits got out that motivator is gone out of you but once motivating you from the stage of sanctification to the stage of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you realize that's just doing the best it can to describe it and the best way I can describe it is one of these little kids it's about two or three years old and we are the ones that lets in demons come in them kids no I that baby has to learn from somewhere and it learn for me in you now whether it be good or bad I mean we thank the thought we hope to think we want to think that it was all good that we transmit it down to our kids but remember the little boy walking in the daddy's footsteps you know I didn't know they said anything to do with a new birth well from the stage of this cleanliness does it coming in with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Prophet said to burn out all now listen if he's right then they must be something left in here if the fiery baptism just to drive out everything that means that everything was that you just got rid of the devil you got rid of that you got to a point that if you remember in your Christian experience that you'd go do wrong and you repent you go back and you do wrong you repent you go back you do wrong you repent do you remember that you live it up and down life right you're not out stealing drinking smoking the quotes in here or the Prophet said you can still be tempted and sanctification you can still be tempted listen folks you ain't go like this but it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost you can still be tempted no it won't let me he won't let it beyond your control and what can happen what about this little baby that's the best way I can describe it little baby that's clean they don't know what seeing is they don't know any of those wrong that's kind of like one time we stopped and looked at a bird up on the side of the road in the cage and a guy walked over and he said don't say no dirty words woman I didn't intend to but I got the point he said cause that bird is gonna say what you say my uncle my aunt used to go through the house saying big long dirty words about him and you know what that bird flew through the house saying the same thing she said about him okay you get it we dedicate the baby Missy brother Dale is a little smarter than the average bear dedicating a baby is wonderful that's a great opportunity but what about getting the people to dedicate themselves to live before that baby so that baby can see Jesus Christ that should be the more gain of anything and why I do that is to splat point those you're not responsible for them kids well there's they got a new south nobody's playing the point that baby is beautiful perfectly clean but then gradually it starts drifting it starts saying things wrong doing things wrong remember the way I described it and I believe it the she virus that killed the 42 children you know I mean where did they get that go up old ball head I mean little kids all right I mean that's what's running around they look at him in well let's call him bald hey well if you go up a bald head I never heard that before but now they heard Mama and Daddy sitting at the table talking I said what is that profit think he's got to do with it why don't he just go awful bald head I've told you my theory they're all the fed mom and daddy to the birth you don't like it I don't either but it's truth I don't intend for it to be part of my life but it's true right where did them kids get old bald head at where do they get all the things to say it again and God come down and killed through two bars because you see now let's move uh we've been talking about the baby I hope you got that point all right now let's move up that's me and you that's me and you what nature do you expect to be in there you get rid of your sin you get rid of your drinking you get rid of your smoking you get rid of your line you get out of this you know but what's there there is nothing to portray Christ you just clean you just blink and remember being clean that's wonderful great place to be to be clean but what if that unclean spirit comes back now did the Bible say swept and garnished kind of look like this you know the white on the internet and if they can't see it the white on the paper is representing the good and pure part of us and Satan the unclean spirit comes back if you don't get something in place of him he's coming back so what's the bet what's the point when we get to that stage there's were the dangers that because the unclean spirit can come back now did your prophet teach on anointed ones and did he teach about anointed ones that you are anointed on your spirit with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit another or go all those doctrines or thoughts or ideas but brother Dale I know I'm saved because I remember today have I cried they cried when they cry funeral you making fun of me no just telling it like it is oh brother branham has he got a part of that who would have dr. Davis and which one it was he preached his first sermon and he said what do you think about it dr. David he said worse sermon ever heard it said what they cried they said they cried funeral the cry twins he said but children are born by the word what about a Baptist preacher straightening out a prophet that don't fit too good does it but is it true do you understand what I'm saying what's in here even though it's swept clean and garnished what's that I mean you did if you got nothing to live with there's got to be something there to cause you to react to move to do they've got to be something about human elements that causes of thinking to desire to move see maybe were to talk about the new birth a whole lot more you might find out there some things about the new birth we never understood we might be where the Prophet said it not waged in the seals where brother Branham said there's a mysterious part of justification a mysterious part of sanctification a mysterious part of the baptism when the old goes under the seals a mysterious part wept and garnished but what kind of nature's ruling there No well would it be our nature of life that we left the snake the motivator that problem we can see as it could be booed out but yet the baptism of the holy ghost am there you just swept and garnished and the devil can come back now if the devil can come back now remember this is the soul so we took this off seeing out of the soul not out of the body not out of spirit or don't deal with that we take the unclean spirit out of the soul that leaves us so pure and great but if we don't get something to replace it Satan's coming back Satan's coming back and he's going to bring seven times worse and the Prophet said they become religious all right now they become religious now let's move up a step he said that's why you can't tell that one let's see and knoweth it not he said that's why you can't tell that woman that it's wrong for her to work in shorts and things go to her why Satan has come back in here he don't stop body they don't stop spirit he goes into where he come out from which was the soul but being a religious demon spirit memory reason conscious in time Satan comes right into that then you become an anointed one Judas cast out Devils heal the sick that's what your prophet said he said he went through salvation of justification sanctification Ricky here's your home will this ask you to read if not in coming out show you some other quotes so if that comes back then you put the snake back in there then you put that sin around our yet you put it in a potato how would you say it because you got a clean sweet wonderful place when Satan comes in he's gonna start bringing back his old nature and he's gonna bring back their religious demons and what is religious demons you can't tell me I don't believe the prophets message I believe everything he says just don't quote that to me too often ok I might bring up a few things me and you both have troubles with okay let's just do the best we can right let's just do the best we can go see that snake goes right back in there and that snake causes that soul to starts inning without here that spirit is anointed with a holy period is that what your prophet said and he said and you're still lost you wanna go ahead to number seven that's right yep let's pull up number seven many people can live in this spirit they can dance in this period they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real Spirit of God anointing on that spirit right not on the soul not in the soul part of doing the spirit memory reason conscious but how the Spirit of God anointing on that spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit because watch what's the reason you couldn't tell that woman she's wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her bobbing her higher was wrong well what sure got to do with it well it did to sound some say the reason you can't tell her she's anointed how are you gonna tell people they're wrong when they have the anointing of the Holy Spirit on them and how same devils cast out seeing all kind of things happening come up and talk Donnie just a little bit about brother and I believe him he's got a true gift you can pray for the sick and they'll be healed but what about the rest of it do you see what anointed ones are anointed ones are people that can do things I'm gonna say it you don't like it they all do things it might be a lot of times being you can't do right because they got that anointing they can cast out devils they can heal the sick they can do all kind of works and wonders from that spirit realm outside of that and that snake still be inside let's see the Bible speaks when I'll do this we'll quit the Bible speaks are being washed by the water of the word all right what is to be washed by the water of the word it's a cleansing what drives out that unclean spirit sanctification the cleansing the cleansing and setting it aside drives out that unclean spirit all right what's going to keep it out fasting and praying and seeking God reading your Bible praying out to God now do you see why brother Dale says it then I don't understand why he said like that he said I draw the beast crying out to God every day of my life and wind up at the end of and find out I was okay then they're not searching my life how many of you ever not do you cry out to God God forgive me of my sins Lord lead me guide me open my eyes of this message my heart to receive it let your love be made manifest the sanctification is a cleansing set aside but it's a very dangerous stage right there because Satan can come back but he comes back religious where he used to be a drunk could this or an altar then when he comes back on that other side a lot of times he's clean on that he stays clean on that he doesn't go back out into the world of sin to do all those things he becomes religious he becomes preachers he becomes people who claim to believe the message and have genuine signs and wonders I told you we're gonna ask that question how do you know that you've been justified how do you know that you've been sanctified then when we get to it we'll ask it by Paul have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believed is that what Paul said about but just remember what I'm talking about and that unclean spirit goes out if you don't get something to replace it he's coming back may take a little while but he's coming back and then you become very religious shouting speaking in tongues having glorious things and still be lost keeps getting stronger see because we asked the point to start with when you come to the altar and repented of your sins and you ask God to forgive you and a great experience comes upon you of those things and you you get to stand up feeling great and wonderful see them down the road it comes in a religious form religious demons to come and take over let Stan come on musician think on these things well I didn't know the new birth was such a complicated thing I thought it's just going to dollar and accept Jesus chronic that's what you've been told but words that in the Bible words it in the prophets message sure come on but remember let's quote all he says let's don't take one time let's take all he says he told the girls he had a problem and she'd come to the altar and was prayed for she got up went back out into the world now I can give you this but I'm paraphrasing it clothes went back out into the world went along either then she come back to the Prophet she said I've went out in the world I've done wrong he said well let's pray he prayed for a while and she got up you remember and she said I got it this time I'm I've got he says no you didn't get it what he told her he said get back down you didn't get it well she went through the Prophet and all of these things and the great experience of dicta that he spoke of her having he said after a while said she got the praying said after a while if she come through and said I knew then she headings that I told her said now you got it see she never went back out into the world after that she had it let's see that religious demon was telling her she had it when she come to the altar probably said you didn't get it in other words why was he saying if he did if you got it you would be back out in the world come on that's one of in teaching justification if it's Union what we won't go back out into the world you women will ha no trouble cutting higher paint your faces and your dresses being too short to worse men sometimes have to be embarrassed well no well I don't preach a lot on that but is it true the dresses got a little sword around here and some and then they drop it in the dark you don't like my terminologies anything for sale has just got to have a price you don't like that language but I'm playing you don't take an old car that's got a rusted body and stick it out on the road you paint up one side of it where it looks good right that corner stupid yeah but you don't show it come on sisters you understand what I'm saying you don't show unless it's for sale this has got to be a price and I don't want that okay that's all right I don't either I see brother Dale is not the hard beating that you think I am but then when I say it I say it hard know one of these days you'll thank me for saying it hey what we got sing that chorus I'm one of them anybody have an ad all doors open I'm so glad [Music] I'm [Music] my today the owners of I'm so glad [Music] give me that way [Music] [Applause] everywhere [Music] for in three to make a toll and I can't say [Music] my brother grunts in that was too and keep this it is burning now [Music] they damn [Music] [Applause] [Music] these people made [Music] see [Music] allowing the [Music] Oh years yes Lord for he has risen they just played for him that God would take care of him and here 30 years selectively you heard I read he's crying out you said if anybody gets somebody on their heart crying out never being even doing the crime and all as well when I just reach down and touch brother colleague whatever we thank you for it in Jesus name in my else every [Music] [Music] breathe [Music] and every time [Music] [Applause] [Music] and it struck me while I was talking to the sister you know we're afraid about that unclean spirit being able to come back but you know what we better be afraid of him coming back to our body taking it our spirit because he can do those things he can work on our body and spirit not get into the soul and take us totally away but he can come back there to that body in that spirit and work on us don't ever think he came cause he'll do it father we thank you for this day and we ask you just got us go with each one of us as we go eat a natural
