[30:11] from all unrighteousness in Jesus name
[30:14] amen enjoyed the kids with the with the
[30:18] taking over the services today and the
[30:20] singing and the and the things I really
[30:22] do appreciate it Matthew 19
[30:27] three through nine
[30:31] and the Pharisees came unto him tempting
[30:33] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[30:36] a man to put away his wife forever calls
[30:37] and he answered and said unto them have
[30:40] you not read that he which made them at
[30:42] the beginning made them male and female
[30:43] and said for this call shall a man leave
[30:46] father and mother and shall cleave to
[30:49] his wife in day twain shall be one flesh
[30:51] wherefore they are no more Twain but one
[30:53] flesh or therefore God hath joined
[30:56] together let not man put asunder they
[30:59] say unto him why did Moses then command
[31:02] to give a writing a divorce and to put
[31:03] her away and he saith unto them Moses
[31:06] because of the hardness of your hearts
[31:08] suffered you to put away your wives but
[31:11] from the beginning it was not so and I
[31:14] say unto you whosoever shall put away
[31:16] his wife except it be for fornication
[31:18] and shall marry another committeth
[31:20] adultery and whosoever married her which
[31:22] is put away doth commit adultery now
[31:26] let's go over to
[31:28] Romans
[31:30] 7
[31:33] 1-6
[31:36] no you're not Brethren fire speak to
[31:38] them that know the law
[31:40] as the law had dominion over a man as
[31:42] long as he liveth for the woman which
[31:44] hath and husband is bound by the law to
[31:46] her husband as long as he liveth but if
[31:50] the husband be dead she is loose from
[31:52] the law of her husband
[31:54] so then if while her husband liveth
[31:57] she'd be married to another man she
[31:58] shall be called on adulteress but if her
[32:01] husband be dead she is free from that
[32:03] law so that she is no adulteress though
[32:06] she'll be married to another man
[32:08] wherefore my brethren ye are also become
[32:11] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[32:14] that you should be married to another
[32:15] even to him who is raised from the dead
[32:19] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[32:21] God for when we were in the flesh the
[32:24] Motions of sin which were by the law
[32:27] did work in our members to bring forth
[32:29] fruit unto death but now we are
[32:32] delivered from the law
[32:34] that being dead wherein we were held
[32:37] that we should serve in newness of
[32:39] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[32:42] letter you may be seated the Lord had
[32:44] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[32:48] will enjoy brother Jonathan being with
[32:50] us and speaking for us and pray that the
[32:52] Lord will take care of him on the
[32:54] highway home give them a safe journey
[32:58] now last Sunday we tried to cover
[33:02] apart and I want to review that because
[33:05] I believe this is a very important part
[33:09] of where we're coming to in our
[33:11] understanding and and I pray and beg
[33:16] please to those that you know don't come
[33:20] ever service and get to be here that
[33:23] they'll please listen to the tapes and
[33:26] things and you know try to get an
[33:28] understanding because we're trying to
[33:30] deal with a lot of things and I believe
[33:32] it will be very helpful to us
[33:35] and people would ask questions you know
[33:39] and they'd say well brother Dale I've
[33:41] done this I've done this I've done that
[33:43] I've done whatever is there any hopes
[33:45] for me
[33:47] if you won't try there's not
[33:51] if you won't put forth an effort there
[33:53] is not
[33:55] God will not override your free moral
[33:58] agency and make you accept anything
[34:00] a pardon is not a pardon unless received
[34:04] as a pardon
[34:05] Joe
[34:06] if he makes a way
[34:08] and why wouldn't anyone want to make a
[34:11] way we were talking last night about
[34:14] something on it and it was mentioned uh
[34:16] somebody did about you know that uh some
[34:20] brother had said well his kids had went
[34:22] out and done wrong and things like that
[34:24] and and said they were you know we're
[34:26] talking about coming to church and the
[34:28] one brother had said well I don't want
[34:30] him in the church
[34:32] my other brother said well
[34:34] that's the only hope they have
[34:38] there is no hopes outside the word of
[34:40] God
[34:41] there is no hopes outside of
[34:44] this message so if you go off and leave
[34:47] and do and forget it then there is no
[34:50] hope
[34:51] see because you make your own brother
[34:54] Tom fabush used to say that you trigger
[34:56] your own predestination that was his way
[34:59] of saying it because the life you live
[35:02] they will prove what we are and what
[35:04] we're Desiring so if we don't desire a
[35:07] pardon there is no pardon for us
[35:09] yeah but I just can't see how so and so
[35:11] and I've I've been told you know that
[35:13] with one
[35:15] for person who said that we would just
[35:17] all here at Lula going to die and go to
[35:19] hell because we let people come here
[35:20] that had marital problems
[35:22] well I hadn't closed the doors yet
[35:27] you know I just keep saying because I
[35:30] believe that's the only host people's
[35:31] got
[35:32] is the word of God
[35:34] I don't believe there's any hopes out in
[35:36] the world for us
[35:37] you know we're not talking about an
[35:39] Alcoholics Anonymous thing and trying to
[35:41] quit drinking or something
[35:43] you know and uh but I just and and I've
[35:46] always said what I believe you know that
[35:48] way you don't have to go off say well I
[35:50] don't know what he believed I don't
[35:52] believe American marriage and divorce
[35:54] situation is blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[35:57] now if you turn it down
[36:00] sure
[36:02] you turned down the grace of marriage
[36:04] and divorce been given then you have
[36:06] blasphemed why because you prove you're
[36:08] an unbeliever
[36:09] because a True Believer can't blaspheme
[36:11] the Holy Ghost
[36:13] seeing we don't look at the scriptures
[36:15] and try to study them to understand we
[36:18] just somebody said something you know
[36:21] about something and they said well as
[36:23] long as they do this as long as they do
[36:25] that there's no hopes well
[36:28] you know
[36:29] one of these days God's going to look at
[36:32] all of us in the same light
[36:35] I believe he does anyway but you know
[36:38] and uh we might find out that a lot of
[36:41] times I found this to be true let me
[36:44] state it in my own language
[36:45] that uh a lot of times people who fight
[36:49] something real hard
[36:53] are people that have got problems
[36:57] and this one certain brother one time
[37:00] brother moat was he and I this brother
[37:02] was real hard about things and
[37:06] I suppose a brother like that
[37:09] and he said I don't know either because
[37:12] he's got
[37:14] the problem itself
[37:16] and I mean I had to admit I said wait a
[37:18] minute are we talking about the same
[37:20] brother
[37:21] and he said yes
[37:23] I said well why is he fighting so hard
[37:27] he said because he's got the same
[37:28] trouble
[37:29] well you know what a lot of people
[37:31] sometimes do they fight like that to try
[37:34] to find truth
[37:36] they're searching but they don't know
[37:37] how to search so they try to fight it
[37:39] you know and maybe somebody can speak
[37:41] something that would help them to
[37:43] understand but you know I I pray that
[37:46] there's Grace for everyone but I don't
[37:48] believe in sloppy greasy Grace you know
[37:50] disgrace I believe in true Grace
[37:54] of God
[37:55] all right in this afternoon I want you
[37:57] to do me a favor
[37:59] and especially this message if I can get
[38:01] the point to where I want it I want you
[38:03] to do me a favor
[38:04] I want you to think about what I'm
[38:06] saying
[38:08] and I'm saying it up front see where
[38:11] that you won't set your mind because I
[38:13] know what happens to the human mind
[38:15] when you cross someone their mindsets in
[38:17] a channel and there's nothing you can do
[38:19] to to change that
[38:22] no matter how much quote you've got or
[38:24] what you're doing once that mind is set
[38:26] in that channel it won't change until
[38:29] that person sees themselves
[38:32] and they back out of that situation some
[38:35] way or whatever the wording would be and
[38:37] and repent
[38:40] and see then 99 of the people are not
[38:42] going to do that right
[38:44] and I realize that
[38:46] but I want you to listen to the message
[38:48] especially the ending part of the
[38:50] message
[38:51] because I've seen something back a long
[38:54] time ago and I've tried to preach it and
[38:57] tried to say it and tried to get it
[38:59] lined up to where that I could say it
[39:02] and sometimes it takes 10 15 years to
[39:05] get there you know
[39:07] and that's no problem with me because
[39:10] I'm not no time creature when it comes
[39:12] to the word of God I believe in it but I
[39:16] want you to watch the ending of the
[39:17] message real good and if you miss it you
[39:21] you get your mindset and a channel go
[39:23] back and listen over again
[39:25] you know I would even suggest you listen
[39:28] to the day's message over the second
[39:30] time
[39:32] now that's how serious it is to me I'm
[39:34] asking you to do that
[39:36] you know because I want you to make sure
[39:39] you get the way I'm saying it
[39:42] all right then I'm responsible
[39:45] the for what did I bring I always am but
[39:48] I mean I want you to get what I'm saying
[39:50] then you can say well you said it
[39:52] that's all right so keep that in mind
[39:53] now we were talking last Sunday about
[39:56] something to me that is very important
[40:00] and uh it's some statements that the
[40:03] prophet made in The Invisible Union
[40:06] and we will get more and more time into
[40:10] this message so I would ask you to read
[40:12] it I've read through it the past couple
[40:15] of days and studying it and notes
[40:18] writing and doing things and you know
[40:20] just getting a few things in line
[40:23] and uh and we might even play the whole
[40:26] message one day just play the tape to
[40:29] make sure you'll follow what I'm saying
[40:31] you know through the message
[40:33] in all of the invisible Union all right
[40:37] now the last thoughts we were talking
[40:39] about is a little thing the prophet said
[40:42] go ahead brother Joe and pull up our
[40:44] brother
[40:44] uh who's talking about Bob I guess who's
[40:48] missing what I miss her who's back there
[40:50] and uh
[40:52] but we gave this quote
[40:55] and you're going to read this quote
[40:56] three times
[40:58] in the message today
[41:01] all right now we won't read all of it
[41:03] we're going to read sections and then
[41:05] we're going to Maybe cover the whole
[41:07] thing but roll it up where they can see
[41:08] the bottom this is invisible Union
[41:10] priest in 1965
[41:13] 1125 paragraph 36. We will be dealing
[41:17] with 35 in just a minute
[41:19] this is where we were at the other day
[41:22] but now I believe also
[41:24] is to my belief
[41:27] that it unfolds one of the great
[41:29] mysteries of Prophecy
[41:31] the r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[41:35] all right now there is a difference in
[41:38] Prophecy
[41:39] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y and p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y
[41:44] we went through that last Sunday
[41:46] Paul uses it I'll show in the scripture
[41:48] in a minute in the same verse
[41:51] he uses both words in the same verse all
[41:54] right
[41:56] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y is
[41:59] the bringing together of all of the
[42:02] scriptures
[42:04] all right we'll go back through what we
[42:06] read last Sunday
[42:07] but p-r-o-p-h-e-s why is somebody
[42:10] telling you that
[42:11] does everybody understand
[42:14] all right now brother random didn't say
[42:15] this is a p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y
[42:19] he uses to see why because he's telling
[42:22] you something see
[42:24] one of the great mysteries of Prophecy
[42:27] and he said I hope the Lord helps us
[42:29] tonight as we deliver this to our
[42:31] waiting people across the country
[42:34] prophecy
[42:37] you remember we gave it I didn't give it
[42:39] to them to get back over again which is
[42:41] all right
[42:42] the word prophets feel
[42:45] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y is used a good many
[42:47] times in the scripture and it comes from
[42:49] the number 43 94 of the strongest
[42:53] Concordance
[42:54] it says prophecy in other words a
[42:57] discourse
[42:59] intimating
[43:02] e-n-a-m-a-t-i-n-g which really means to
[43:04] come forth or originate
[43:07] so it's a discourse originating from
[43:10] divine inspiration and declaring the
[43:14] purposes of God
[43:17] whether by reproving or admonishing the
[43:21] wicked
[43:22] are comforting The Afflicted or
[43:25] revealing things hidden
[43:28] especially by foretelling future events
[43:34] now that's
[43:37] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y-p-r-e-p-h-e-s-y is the
[43:39] person who speaks
[43:44] all right
[43:46] now the prophets would bring their
[43:48] message they would speak it
[43:50] p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y that's they were
[43:52] speaking that message from divine
[43:54] inspiration
[43:55] all right then that message that I was
[43:58] trying to say Sunday must tie together
[44:00] every scripture must tie together
[44:03] all the way through the Bible it must
[44:05] tie together and it makes one
[44:07] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[44:11] all right nobody understand it makes one
[44:14] discourse bringing forth or showing the
[44:17] purpose of God or or the scriptures
[44:20] being expressed and explained
[44:24] to give us an understanding
[44:28] see that way then we believe the Bible
[44:29] to be as I say you start in Genesis with
[44:32] a white dog you wind up in Revelations
[44:34] with a cat or something everybody's okay
[44:36] we got an animal
[44:37] but that ain't the Bible
[44:39] he's got to wind up with not a black
[44:41] white dog and Genesis a black one in
[44:43] Revelation that's not right you got to
[44:45] have the white dog an Indian and a white
[44:47] dog you understand you've got to have
[44:49] the same thing you can't start out with
[44:52] one God and wind up in a trinity
[44:56] you'd wind up like a man at work one day
[44:58] at Pentecostal and I thought man I done
[45:01] really hit something I said I knew what
[45:03] church he went to you know and I said
[45:06] you're talking about water baptism the
[45:08] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[45:09] yeah
[45:11] well I knew they didn't do it see
[45:15] I've hit me somebody to talk to
[45:18] I said you know nowhere in the Bible
[45:21] was anybody ever baptized Father Son and
[45:23] Holy Ghost he said that's right
[45:29] he said
[45:31] I said Lord churches baptized father son
[45:33] the Holy Ghost
[45:34] he said yeah we do
[45:40] now you better help me Lord but anyhow
[45:45] he said the reason was he said back dire
[45:49] they were trinitarians
[45:52] and said they had to baptize in the name
[45:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:58] he said but we understand God so we go
[46:00] to the father son Holy Ghost
[46:03] goodbye
[46:05] I really lost that one all right
[46:08] now see he thought he had it all tied
[46:10] together
[46:12] but see he had two different things
[46:14] right
[46:16] okay
[46:17] now if you got two different things in
[46:18] the Bible remember what you got
[46:21] you got the Antichrist
[46:23] because that was the way the prophet
[46:24] knew when the white horse rider rolled
[46:26] off he said here's stand in the land
[46:27] with a book in his hand there goes the
[46:29] white horse rider look at that fella
[46:31] that guy he said Darby's another person
[46:34] two persons in the Bible one of them is
[46:36] Antichrist
[46:38] all right now
[46:41] so a a discourse or a study or a
[46:44] presenting of one's thoughts
[46:48] coming forth are originating
[46:51] from divine inspiration
[46:54] to bring to us the purpose of revelation
[46:57] of God all right now
[47:00] all the scriptures in must line up
[47:03] together
[47:04] or it would not be the same revelation
[47:07] you remember the prophet said each
[47:10] Prophet lined up his message by the
[47:12] prophet prior to him
[47:14] now did they necessarily have the
[47:17] ability to read what the man behind them
[47:21] or was it just Prophet just illustrating
[47:23] the the correctness of the word that no
[47:27] matter if they even did not hear
[47:30] the other one
[47:31] that they would line it up and it would
[47:33] come through so beautiful
[47:35] to make a beautiful picture all right
[47:37] now
[47:39] now have an odd way of taking it but I
[47:41] want you to think with me for a second
[47:46] see then this seventh Church AIDS
[47:48] messenger
[47:50] Sabbath angel
[47:53] now I'm trying to illustrate
[47:57] okay I'm going to do a lot of
[47:59] illustrating and I'll read it a minute
[48:01] while we illustrate
[48:04] and to illustrate is to take an example
[48:06] and explain it
[48:09] to take a type
[48:10] and show the anti-type to illustrate you
[48:14] know the show
[48:15] all right
[48:16] now this seventh Church age messenger
[48:19] has no certain mystery
[48:22] you've heard that quote
[48:26] go ahead and pull it up Brothers in the
[48:28] first seal number two there
[48:31] notice what he says
[48:39] it happened under the messengers arise
[48:40] on Earth
[48:41] what it's a great plan until it comes to
[48:44] the last angel
[48:45] now he has no certain mystery
[48:49] Now read this real carefully
[48:52] because you you've got two thoughts here
[48:56] that if you don't get them together
[48:57] you're you're messed up so listen
[49:02] this last Angel has no certain mystery
[49:06] will these folks bring all the mystery
[49:07] we're going to read what he says but
[49:09] he's got to bring it's got to be a
[49:10] certain way
[49:16] but he gathers up all that's been lost
[49:19] in the mother ages
[49:22] all the truths that wasn't truly
[49:25] revealed yet
[49:27] see as a revelation come
[49:30] then he reveals those things
[49:33] in his day
[49:36] if you want to read it then you go to
[49:37] Revelations 10 1.
[49:39] and you'll get it
[49:41] now
[49:46] read the rest of it let's go to the next
[49:48] paragraph takes a book of seals and
[49:51] breaks them and shows the seventh angel
[49:54] for this alone the mysteries of God is
[49:58] the ministry of the seventh angel
[50:01] now and we just come through the church
[50:02] ages with even history and prove that
[50:05] see it is the Angel's message of the
[50:08] seventh Church
[50:10] all right Reveals All the Mysteries
[50:12] that's been in this past
[50:15] all the things in the past Revelations
[50:17] 10 1-7 that's to be now
[50:21] listen to what he's saying
[50:24] see when I made this statement do you
[50:26] looked I guess
[50:27] this messenger this seventh Church age
[50:30] messenger and no certain mystery
[50:35] amen because he was to take all that was
[50:38] left over of the Mysteries
[50:41] now divide the message of brother
[50:44] Branham and you'll see what I'm talking
[50:45] about
[50:47] in 1963
[50:50] he had come to the position to explain
[50:53] all the Mysteries that was left over in
[50:56] the church ages
[51:00] follow me
[51:02] then his message came through the
[51:05] opening of the seals right
[51:09] right this message of Malachi 4 is going
[51:10] to do two things they're not answer the
[51:12] children back and reveal the seven
[51:14] Thunders all right now to get the point
[51:19] me he has no certain mystery
[51:22] the seventh angel
[51:25] the seventh Church age messenger
[51:28] now brother Branham was not the
[51:30] messenger to lady osia
[51:34] I don't have time to explain all these I
[51:36] have over the years
[51:38] the Holy Ghost came on zeusa Street
[51:41] he says no messenger the age 464 seal
[51:44] book go read it
[51:46] all right
[51:49] you say yeah but he preached to the
[51:51] cemetery he brought his message he had
[51:53] to come and restore what they had left
[51:56] off or explain what they had left off
[51:58] then the seals broke to him and he
[52:02] brought his message to explain the
[52:04] entire Bible
[52:08] now
[52:09] these things are very important because
[52:12] listen
[52:14] if the Bible is a prophecy
[52:21] if it's a prophecy puree p h e c y
[52:25] all right
[52:26] then that will tie together what we're
[52:28] talking about
[52:30] because in the invisible Union brought a
[52:32] random made a statement that was
[52:33] outstanding to me and always being that
[52:35] really helped me I didn't bring it but
[52:38] I think it's
[52:40] paragraph 29 or something
[52:42] it's an invisible Union
[52:44] he said Matthew Mark Luke and John he
[52:47] said they wrote what Jesus said
[52:52] but he said Paul put the New Testament
[52:54] together
[52:55] wrote it
[52:58] well that stuck with me you see
[53:02] he said well didn't Matthew Mark Luke
[53:04] and John write the New Testament
[53:09] they wrote what Jesus said
[53:11] you understand it
[53:14] they wrote what he's saying
[53:17] then Paul comes and ties together the
[53:20] Loose Ends
[53:21] well see here comes brother Brandon with
[53:23] his ministry
[53:25] and God is leading him to tie together
[53:27] all of the Loose Ends
[53:31] of all of those Angel Messengers left
[53:33] off Through the Ages
[53:36] the then his message came
[53:38] to finish the Mysteries
[53:41] marriage and divorce Rapture serpent
[53:44] seed Etc all these are quotes were
[53:46] revealed in the seals
[53:48] all right
[53:50] revealed in the prophecy
[53:57] see all it down to that those others had
[53:59] said we're not completely finished
[54:04] so not only do writings of the Bible of
[54:06] Paul and Peter and him and then even the
[54:09] church ages coming down still having
[54:11] things there were still some
[54:13] things left off from even the Old
[54:15] Testament Saints the Old Testament
[54:17] prophets
[54:19] they were preaching and pointing down
[54:22] too and bringing it prophecy that would
[54:25] lay perfectly in order and then here
[54:29] would come the seventh churches Angel
[54:31] not the one to bring this to speak the
[54:34] mysteries of the ages
[54:37] the message of the Prophet that began he
[54:39] said in 63 of the opening of the seals
[54:42] read the Rapture message
[54:44] and not in the beginning but said when
[54:46] the
[54:47] Mysteries come forth
[54:49] all right see then the Bible was sealed
[54:51] up
[54:54] right
[54:56] the prophecy was sealed up
[55:01] when the prophet came he began to
[55:04] explain
[55:06] those Mysteries
[55:09] the prophecy was becoming from
[55:13] letters on the page and thoughts
[55:16] into a revelation
[55:19] Daniel 9 and 24 says seal up the vision
[55:23] and prophecy
[55:26] p r o p h e c y
[55:30] then say p r o p h e s y because that
[55:33] would have stopped you from talking
[55:36] Daniel was told seal up the prophecy
[55:40] were until the end time
[55:44] all right then it would come into the
[55:46] end time
[55:49] and then you would have in the Bible
[55:53] everything would be getting set in order
[55:57] if you realize where we're standing
[55:58] folks
[56:00] you and I are standing with a book
[56:03] that has been explained to us right
[56:08] that is sealed away from the world
[56:09] because they do not know the prophecy
[56:15] see they don't know the truth of the
[56:17] word
[56:19] they sealed away to them
[56:22] it's only revealed to the bride right he
[56:25] said well these others can preach about
[56:26] it Matthew Martin Luke and John could
[56:28] write about it
[56:30] but they wasn't chosen to put the New
[56:33] Testament together
[56:35] yet they had the baptism in the Holy
[56:37] Ghost and John goes on to Patmos
[56:40] yeah Paul was chose to put it together
[56:44] he brought the prophecies
[56:48] into his message
[56:50] and preached
[56:52] Christ in you the hope of glory
[56:57] bring in examples of all of the types
[57:00] the Shadows the things that the prophets
[57:03] had said
[57:05] Matthew Martin Luke and John wasn't
[57:07] chosen to do that
[57:09] the Apostle Paul was chosen to write
[57:11] that
[57:13] we see the Ages come down
[57:16] those great men and great Revelations
[57:18] that they brought from the word of God
[57:22] but they were not chosen
[57:24] to stand in the end time with the
[57:26] opening of the seals
[57:29] and show that
[57:30] their prophecy was correct
[57:34] what do you think brother Adam meant
[57:36] when he said if Martin Luther was here
[57:38] today he'd believe this message
[57:44] but yet he says he did not have
[57:45] justification in his total understanding
[57:49] he said in the seal books if you've got
[57:50] a mystery of justification
[57:51] sanctification of baptism of the Holy
[57:53] Ghost
[57:54] that they didn't even understand yet
[57:56] they preached it
[57:59] because it could bring the prophecy
[58:01] together
[58:03] they couldn't see it all tied together
[58:05] they just read and preach
[58:08] and that's what mankind does and that's
[58:09] the way the preachers of the message do
[58:13] but in Romans 12 and 6
[58:16] Paul says whether prophecy PRC why
[58:21] let us prophesy the r-o-p-h-e-s-y
[58:26] if we understand
[58:31] the prophecy
[58:33] we could prophesy we can talk about it
[58:37] right but that's the reason people don't
[58:38] talk about it they don't understand it
[58:46] but yet it's true right
[58:49] right God's word is real
[58:52] this message has the answers
[58:58] because this message brings together the
[59:00] prophecy
[59:02] and then someone had to speak it for it
[59:04] to be made known into our hearts
[59:09] second Peter 1 and 19 Peter says I was
[59:13] up on the mountain
[59:15] I saw these things
[59:18] but I was more sure word of Prophecy
[59:21] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[59:24] go and look it up
[59:28] see he said the Holy Ghost
[59:33] that Jesus according to John 14 26 says
[59:36] he'll bring to your remembrance
[59:37] whatsoever I said and teach you things
[59:40] to come
[59:43] Peter said I've got a more sure word of
[59:45] Prophecy I've got the new birth
[59:50] and that new birth will bring to my
[59:52] understanding what I have need of
[59:56] and it will show me the prophecy
[59:58] then I can prophesy about it
[1:00:02] I could tell about it
[1:00:05] you can only tell about what's revealed
[1:00:06] to you right
[1:00:08] you see we're trying to get across last
[1:00:10] Sunday
[1:00:12] Revelation 1 and 3 says blessed are they
[1:00:15] that hear the words how many times are
[1:00:16] read that I read it 90 something times
[1:00:20] the mayor in the
[1:00:22] series just prior to this
[1:00:24] The Book of Revelation they're read at
[1:00:26] 96 93 or four times
[1:00:29] hear the words of this prophecy
[1:00:35] we're talking about prophesying it's
[1:00:37] talking about a prophecy
[1:00:41] all the Bible is coming down to reveal
[1:00:43] one thing revelation 22 and 7 said to
[1:00:46] keep the sayings of the prophecy of this
[1:00:48] book
[1:00:53] things of the prophecy
[1:00:55] the whole book is a prophecy
[1:01:00] Revelation 19 and 10 says for the
[1:01:03] testimony of Jesus Christ is what the
[1:01:05] spirit of Prophecy
[1:01:10] p r o p h e c y see if that is said
[1:01:13] p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y then
[1:01:15] you'd be dealing with anointed ones
[1:01:17] because anointed ones are are talking
[1:01:20] saying things but they're not saying it
[1:01:23] according to the prophecy
[1:01:25] they're not keeping the words correct
[1:01:26] that's the difference the anointed ones
[1:01:28] and the genuine the genuine would stand
[1:01:31] with the word
[1:01:36] the others are just prophesying you're
[1:01:39] speaking
[1:01:40] hitting and missing
[1:01:47] right around says
[1:01:53] that this is a prophecy
[1:01:57] Romans 7.
[1:02:02] is a prophecy
[1:02:08] now I'm going to say this and I'm going
[1:02:09] to go over it time and time again for
[1:02:10] the mark and I we're talking one day
[1:02:12] going down the road and he said brother
[1:02:14] Dale I see
[1:02:17] that the whole Bible is marriage and
[1:02:19] divorce
[1:02:20] yeah
[1:02:22] this video right
[1:02:25] the whole Bible is marriage and divorced
[1:02:27] the whole Bible is a new birth
[1:02:29] the whole Bible is a revelation of Jesus
[1:02:31] Christ
[1:02:36] now let's look at paragraph 35 of the
[1:02:38] invisible Union number three brother Joe
[1:02:40] I told him I said put this three times
[1:02:41] in here now he's he's trying to figure
[1:02:44] it out see before I got in there to tell
[1:02:46] him
[1:02:47] what I was intending to do with it
[1:02:50] so this is
[1:02:54] he ain't got it right something's on him
[1:02:56] that's his Christ's mystery
[1:03:04] paragraph 35 of the invisible Union how
[1:03:07] are we getting it now okay
[1:03:11] Paul here is illustrating
[1:03:14] now
[1:03:16] I'll back up on this in a minute again
[1:03:18] but what is illustrating
[1:03:21] you're you're taking something
[1:03:23] and you're illustrating it
[1:03:26] you're explaining it
[1:03:28] or or are doing with it you take a a
[1:03:32] round does it
[1:03:34] by every sermon he he takes an Old
[1:03:36] Testament and explains it to the New
[1:03:39] Testament right
[1:03:40] Paul was what he was doing taking his
[1:03:43] writings and explain you're illustrating
[1:03:45] it you're trying to make a picture out
[1:03:48] of what you're doing
[1:03:51] now he's talking about Romans 7.
[1:03:57] Paul here is given an illustration in
[1:04:00] our scripture Romans 7 that's what he's
[1:04:02] at
[1:04:03] about the law and Grace
[1:04:07] and illustrating it like marriage and
[1:04:09] divorce
[1:04:12] this passage is very seldom preached on
[1:04:15] because it more or less pertains to like
[1:04:17] marriage and divorce
[1:04:21] watch now
[1:04:23] but it also pertains to a greater
[1:04:25] portion
[1:04:27] of marriage and divorce
[1:04:30] of how that he's trying to set in order
[1:04:33] here that we
[1:04:35] as a church can no more be married to
[1:04:38] the world and to Christ at the same time
[1:04:41] and be legal and lawful about it than it
[1:04:45] can be for a woman to be living with a
[1:04:47] husband while she's got a living husband
[1:04:51] and I have my own ideas and thoughts on
[1:04:53] that
[1:04:55] but a greater portion
[1:05:02] but it also pertains to a greater
[1:05:04] portion of marriage and divorce
[1:05:08] that's what I said you better stay with
[1:05:10] me this afternoon because please don't
[1:05:12] Tang on my words
[1:05:14] and just do the best I can I don't have
[1:05:15] no education not if enough sense to be
[1:05:18] able to talk but yet
[1:05:21] sometimes the Lord speaks
[1:05:24] the prophet says that Romans 7 is a
[1:05:27] greater portion
[1:05:30] of marriage and divorce
[1:05:33] now you with me are you higher
[1:05:36] wake them up
[1:05:40] hard to listen while you're snoring
[1:05:48] now according to Webster
[1:05:52] you know dictionary
[1:05:54] apportion
[1:05:58] is a part of a whole
[1:06:02] see it's not all of it
[1:06:05] but part of it
[1:06:07] portion now remember what your Prophet
[1:06:09] said now so see you'll run across when I
[1:06:12] go across you'll miss it and you won't
[1:06:14] follow me he said this is Romans 7 is a
[1:06:17] greater portion
[1:06:19] of marriage and divorce
[1:06:23] yeah
[1:06:26] I've never explained some of these
[1:06:27] things I'm going to be in this afternoon
[1:06:32] I've preached up to him for years and
[1:06:34] had to back off because I didn't
[1:06:35] understand how to explain it
[1:06:39] if you want to say advise you I'd listen
[1:06:41] to it over again
[1:06:43] now when you say a portion of anything
[1:06:47] you're saying that you only have part of
[1:06:49] it
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:56] you only have part of it
[1:07:00] all right
[1:07:01] now
[1:07:04] but when you say a greater portion
[1:07:12] what does that mean
[1:07:14] the prophet said this is a greater
[1:07:16] portion of marriage and divorce
[1:07:22] a greater portion would be a larger
[1:07:24] amount
[1:07:26] you go with me I think Webster that's
[1:07:28] brother Dale talking okay
[1:07:31] a greater portion would mean a larger
[1:07:34] amount of the same thing
[1:07:39] or in other words the whole of it
[1:07:45] right
[1:07:46] anything above a portion which is a part
[1:07:51] you would be make dealing with more
[1:07:55] right and finally you would come to the
[1:07:58] whole of it
[1:08:00] now are you seeing why I've spent so
[1:08:03] much time last Sunday and started back
[1:08:04] over again today that a prophecy
[1:08:09] see if you cut the Bible in high if
[1:08:12] you've got a high for prophecy
[1:08:16] if you take all the Bible but leave out
[1:08:19] the Book of Revelations
[1:08:22] you only have a portion right
[1:08:26] right are you following me
[1:08:29] you don't have the pure prophecy
[1:08:33] you only have a portion
[1:08:38] anything outside of the Seven Seals in
[1:08:40] the Book of Revelations
[1:08:43] you're dealing with a prophecy that is
[1:08:45] not complete
[1:08:51] you're dealing with a portion or
[1:08:52] something
[1:08:54] see this message is not a portion
[1:08:59] this message is the entirety or the
[1:09:02] whole of the matter
[1:09:04] all that we're going to get while we're
[1:09:05] here in this world right
[1:09:08] is revealed in the seals
[1:09:11] all right
[1:09:13] so just trying to make a simple little
[1:09:14] illustration
[1:09:16] because that's what wrote around said he
[1:09:18] said now Paul is using Romans 7 as an
[1:09:21] illustration
[1:09:26] now we've totally got that backward
[1:09:30] s oh man that was shock you enough to
[1:09:32] get you to stay awake long enough to
[1:09:33] listen
[1:09:37] I don't really they'll understand that
[1:09:38] like you I don't mean this sarcastically
[1:09:41] I'm just I'm honest
[1:09:47] why would a prophet say
[1:09:50] that Romans 7
[1:09:54] was only a
[1:09:57] marriage and divorce was only a
[1:09:59] portion of that
[1:10:07] that's what I said now
[1:10:09] you missed my wording
[1:10:11] you got a problem
[1:10:14] marriage and divorce is not the highest
[1:10:16] order
[1:10:21] now you know what I'm talking about
[1:10:22] marriage and divorce I'm talking about
[1:10:23] the physical
[1:10:26] okay everybody with me
[1:10:28] the natural
[1:10:30] does everybody thinks that's the Apex
[1:10:33] and I admit I used to think that
[1:10:36] back a few years ago it began to dawn on
[1:10:38] me why Prophet would make a few
[1:10:40] statements
[1:10:42] and then begin to ponder Lord
[1:10:45] we're missing the whole thing
[1:10:51] marriage and divorce the grace of
[1:10:53] marriage and divorce where you know go
[1:10:56] home as you are
[1:10:59] that's not the Apex or the Christian
[1:11:01] example
[1:11:09] instead you better listen today
[1:11:13] go back and listen again
[1:11:20] see when you say a greater portion
[1:11:24] run around and said it there he said
[1:11:27] Romans 7.
[1:11:29] that more or less spoke on his marriage
[1:11:31] and divorce
[1:11:33] he said but it's a greater portion of
[1:11:36] marriage and divorce
[1:11:39] now what is a greater portion
[1:11:42] of marriage and divorce
[1:11:49] what is a greater portion of it
[1:11:53] Mr Gale says brother they'll make you
[1:11:55] think
[1:11:56] okay
[1:12:03] see the entire Bible then would be
[1:12:07] the revelation of the new birth
[1:12:12] the one God to start with because you
[1:12:14] can't get anywhere without that part
[1:12:17] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right
[1:12:20] because it's what we read in Revelations
[1:12:22] 1 1-3 there every time ready to
[1:12:24] revelation of Jesus Christ God give to
[1:12:26] Jesus to give to John
[1:12:28] blessed is he that readeth the prophecy
[1:12:31] of this book
[1:12:33] that's why we read throughout the things
[1:12:35] are in Revelations this is a prophecy
[1:12:39] all right
[1:12:43] what is a greater portion
[1:12:47] it means more of
[1:12:51] now
[1:12:53] you know
[1:12:55] I I love banana pudding
[1:13:01] but banana pudding used to be bananas
[1:13:05] and cream and whipping on the top
[1:13:12] now you bite into banana pudding you
[1:13:14] find pecans
[1:13:16] you find all kinds of things in
[1:13:19] and I love it it's good don't
[1:13:21] misunderstand me
[1:13:23] it's just illustrating
[1:13:25] so you say banana pudding and they're
[1:13:27] telling what you're biting down on
[1:13:30] but all goes together
[1:13:33] now if you're eating in the Bible
[1:13:37] and you eat a little bit of it
[1:13:41] it makes you want more
[1:13:43] but it makes you want more of the same
[1:13:45] thing
[1:13:48] so if you get something out of the Bible
[1:13:50] as a portion
[1:13:52] apart
[1:13:56] then the greater portion cannot be
[1:13:59] something different
[1:14:02] it's more of the same thing
[1:14:05] you remember like brother random talking
[1:14:07] about the black man about the watermelon
[1:14:09] said you know
[1:14:11] he said that was a piece of watermelon
[1:14:13] was good but said Auntie some more
[1:14:17] why because it just makes you want to
[1:14:19] eat
[1:14:20] just a little bit just a portion
[1:14:23] you know
[1:14:24] and uh you know you want to go but now
[1:14:27] listen what would be a greater portion
[1:14:31] of marriage and divorce
[1:14:37] when it would have to tie together to be
[1:14:39] more of the same
[1:14:50] I wrote it like this here's where you
[1:14:52] may differ with me
[1:14:54] on what I'll say today
[1:14:56] but pray before you let your mind
[1:15:00] Wonder on what I'm trying to say
[1:15:05] and self-interpreted it
[1:15:09] a greater portion
[1:15:12] go ahead with number four
[1:15:20] questions and answers law having a
[1:15:22] shadow priest 54
[1:15:23] 05 16.
[1:15:27] paragraph 8 30 e 18.
[1:15:32] he's coming down discussing with people
[1:15:34] you know and he said but you see
[1:15:36] he was a Nazarite
[1:15:38] or Nazarene because he was talking to
[1:15:40] somebody about the Bible all right
[1:15:42] and he thought that sanctification was
[1:15:45] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:47] that's what they teach we think that
[1:15:49] that the Methodist his sanctification
[1:15:52] John Wesley's teaching of sanctification
[1:15:54] was the teaching of the baptism of the
[1:15:56] Holy Ghost I've read his own writing of
[1:15:58] it
[1:15:58] we think it's just all they call
[1:16:00] sanctification
[1:16:01] he taught sanctification was the new
[1:16:03] birth
[1:16:05] Luther taught justification was the New
[1:16:07] Birth you know what it was in that day
[1:16:12] all right
[1:16:14] so the man the Nazarene thought that
[1:16:16] sanctification was the baptism of the
[1:16:17] Holy Spirit which it is not
[1:16:21] there's no scripture to show that I'll
[1:16:24] prove that in a little bit in the Bible
[1:16:25] see that it isn't
[1:16:27] you're not sealed by sanctification
[1:16:31] you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:33] Spirit
[1:16:35] a ceiling is the completing of the work
[1:16:39] that's the reason it couldn't be sealed
[1:16:41] under Luther or Wesley either one it had
[1:16:44] to come to the baptism
[1:16:47] before the church sealed away till the
[1:16:51] day of redemption
[1:16:52] didn't mean they wasn't saved down to
[1:16:54] there he's talking about the ages and
[1:16:57] the birth that it's to bring forth and
[1:16:58] look what he says
[1:17:01] he said oh
[1:17:03] they're not lost
[1:17:04] see he knew somebody's thinking that
[1:17:07] they're saying certainly they are
[1:17:09] sanctification is the same work of the
[1:17:10] grace
[1:17:11] are the same Grace that saved you Jesus
[1:17:14] said no man can come to me except my
[1:17:16] father draws him and it's the holy
[1:17:18] spirit all alone
[1:17:22] but that's a portion of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:26] justification and sanctification is a
[1:17:29] portion
[1:17:30] of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:32] now I'm getting you to a point to think
[1:17:34] about why would he say
[1:17:39] Romans 7 is a greater portion
[1:17:42] of marriage and divorce
[1:17:45] that's the thought okay
[1:17:48] but it's greater poor this is a greater
[1:17:51] portion of the Holy Spirit what the new
[1:17:54] birth
[1:17:56] and then when you receive the baptism of
[1:17:58] the Holy Ghost that is the completion of
[1:18:01] the Holy Spirit taking us
[1:18:03] up taking up its Abode in you
[1:18:08] now
[1:18:10] when you're Justified that's the work of
[1:18:12] the Holy Spirit
[1:18:13] right
[1:18:14] when you're Sanctified that's the work
[1:18:16] of the Holy Spirit that's the only part
[1:18:18] of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:20] but when you receive the new birth you
[1:18:22] received the very life of God
[1:18:25] which is a greater portion
[1:18:28] of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:30] but it's a greater portion of the same
[1:18:32] thing you started with at justification
[1:18:39] so when brother random is explaining
[1:18:41] then what's he saying
[1:18:44] Romans 7 is a
[1:18:47] greater portion
[1:18:50] of marriage and divorce
[1:19:01] see Paul is illustrating
[1:19:05] are given an example
[1:19:08] of Law and Grace
[1:19:11] he's really preaching on Law and Grace
[1:19:13] given the example of marriage and
[1:19:16] divorce
[1:19:17] now to illustrate according to Webster
[1:19:19] is to make clear or intelligible
[1:19:23] as by example
[1:19:26] all right
[1:19:28] go ahead with number five
[1:19:33] same quote we started
[1:19:37] paragraph 35 invisible Union
[1:19:41] here Paul is given an illustration in
[1:19:43] our scripture
[1:19:46] about the law and Grace
[1:19:48] and illustrating it like
[1:19:51] marriage and divorce
[1:19:59] now which one is Paul speaking of
[1:20:07] is Paul speaking of marriage and divorce
[1:20:09] as the Apex or finality or is he
[1:20:12] speaking of Law and Grace being the
[1:20:14] finality
[1:20:18] if he's using marriage and divorce to
[1:20:20] illustrate it
[1:20:23] or give an example
[1:20:25] then marriage and divorces literally
[1:20:28] we're talking about for the bodies you
[1:20:29] know the things that you know
[1:20:32] that's not the Apex
[1:20:37] that's not the top
[1:20:46] so you may have to go back and listen
[1:20:49] to get the point
[1:20:55] look at paragraph 43 while you're at an
[1:20:57] invisible Union
[1:21:05] the illustration here
[1:21:09] showing the relationship
[1:21:11] of bride to Christ
[1:21:14] the elect lady and how she was to be
[1:21:17] brought to him
[1:21:18] horseshoe would come from and how that
[1:21:21] she would be brought to him the church
[1:21:24] here in illustration that we got in view
[1:21:29] is Illustrated
[1:21:31] by a woman
[1:21:36] now what who's he talking about the
[1:21:38] woman or the bride
[1:21:40] right come on I'm glad that said that
[1:21:42] see
[1:21:43] he's not talking about the woman he's
[1:21:46] talking about the woman but he's
[1:21:47] illustrating with her
[1:21:53] which is greater the top or the antetop
[1:21:58] only speaks of the answer type
[1:22:03] so if you're given an example
[1:22:07] your example is not the reality
[1:22:14] I'll bring my son out of Egypt
[1:22:19] that was not the real son right
[1:22:22] who was a real son when Jesus come out
[1:22:25] of Egypt
[1:22:26] that was a type Jesus was the antetop or
[1:22:30] fulfillment
[1:22:31] of the type
[1:22:33] so Shake Yourself now
[1:22:36] The church here in illustration that we
[1:22:39] got in view is illustrated by a woman
[1:22:41] which a woman is always the type of the
[1:22:43] church because the church is considered
[1:22:45] a bride a bride she is the Bride of the
[1:22:47] Lord Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:22:49] so now he's not talking that's why we're
[1:22:52] going to get into it when brother Brown
[1:22:53] and we'll get back into invisible Union
[1:22:56] he said I'm not talking about you women
[1:23:01] he said whatever you are is between you
[1:23:04] and God
[1:23:06] if you read the message I heard him
[1:23:09] he said I'm talking about the bride
[1:23:14] of Christ
[1:23:17] okay
[1:23:22] look at the next one paragraph 81
[1:23:24] invisible Union
[1:23:28] it's no better body being abetting
[1:23:30] ground and therefore it's a sacred Trust
[1:23:32] not to defile that now speaking now
[1:23:34] bringing this to an illustration
[1:23:37] copper Shadow example
[1:23:40] to show you where the church stands
[1:23:46] and Romans 7 to show you where the
[1:23:48] church stands
[1:23:51] I'm not speaking of you women
[1:23:55] talking about women Natural Women
[1:24:03] I'm not speaking of you women whatever
[1:24:05] you are that's between you and God are
[1:24:08] you men but I'm speaking of the church
[1:24:11] and Christ
[1:24:19] now
[1:24:27] Paul is
[1:24:30] speaking
[1:24:32] in Romans 7
[1:24:35] his real thought his own glow and Grace
[1:24:44] we don't need to know about law and
[1:24:46] Grace we ain't never been under law
[1:24:48] that's what the Jews said
[1:24:52] I said we ain't never been unto bondage
[1:24:55] to nobody and at that exact time they
[1:24:57] were under Roman bondage
[1:25:02] right that's what they said
[1:25:05] Paul is talking about law and Grace
[1:25:10] and he's illustrating it
[1:25:16] he's given the example
[1:25:19] of marriage and divorce
[1:25:24] now whether you realize it or not if I
[1:25:26] was you I wouldn't holler amen God if
[1:25:28] you do then you trapped yourself
[1:25:30] because you just admitted you didn't
[1:25:32] know what you were talking about until I
[1:25:33] started
[1:25:36] sarcastic go ahead
[1:25:41] but I'm trying to get you to think for
[1:25:44] one time in your life sensibly let the
[1:25:46] Holy Spirit talk to you
[1:25:52] he's managing divorce the top Apex
[1:26:01] that ain't the way your prophet's
[1:26:03] explaining him
[1:26:05] marriage and divorce is not the greater
[1:26:07] portion
[1:26:14] marriage and divorce is what he's using
[1:26:16] to illustrate it
[1:26:19] he's typing with it
[1:26:21] he's given examples with it
[1:26:24] the highest order of all is Law and
[1:26:26] Grace
[1:26:40] First Corinthians 10 and 11 Paul speaks
[1:26:43] of how that
[1:26:47] these things happen
[1:26:49] to them
[1:26:51] for examples which was the children of
[1:26:53] Israel
[1:26:57] you take examples to show what you're
[1:27:00] talking about you don't take what you're
[1:27:02] talking about to show examples
[1:27:04] anybody with me
[1:27:07] you take your example to show what your
[1:27:09] thought is
[1:27:13] Paul is not explaining marriage and
[1:27:15] divorce
[1:27:18] in Romans 7.
[1:27:20] he's explaining law and Grace
[1:27:23] right
[1:27:24] his example
[1:27:27] is marriage and divorce
[1:27:30] the greater portion of Law and Grace
[1:27:37] well brother Dale always thought the
[1:27:39] greatest thing when we get these bodies
[1:27:40] figured out
[1:27:55] so you take an example
[1:27:57] or an illustration
[1:28:01] a description
[1:28:05] you use that to explain what you're
[1:28:07] really talking about
[1:28:13] this were to help us be able to study
[1:28:15] the message the whole message
[1:28:20] not just marriage and divorce see that's
[1:28:22] what everybody thinks they think if I
[1:28:24] just hear the marriage divorce I'm ready
[1:28:25] for the rapture
[1:28:27] how come you still got about a lot of
[1:28:30] questions about it
[1:28:31] how come are you still saying well I'm
[1:28:33] wondering if I'm free I don't know where
[1:28:35] I'm free or not I hope I'm free maybe I
[1:28:36] am I don't know
[1:28:43] now you better swallow
[1:28:47] you see I don't believe brother random
[1:28:49] needed the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:28:50] in a literal extent
[1:28:54] so I make that blunt plain plain plain
[1:28:57] blunt
[1:28:59] he kept himself
[1:29:03] his wife had kept herself and they
[1:29:04] didn't need that
[1:29:09] but when it comes to law and Grace
[1:29:15] what about it
[1:29:26] you use an example
[1:29:29] of something that has been now listen to
[1:29:32] the thought
[1:29:35] I wrote on it very important
[1:29:38] you use an example an illustration
[1:29:43] to explain
[1:29:46] what is now right there
[1:29:51] or will be to come
[1:29:55] right now say that again so you listen
[1:29:57] you use an example of what has been
[1:30:04] to explain what is
[1:30:08] or what will come
[1:30:11] everybody with me
[1:30:12] that's sensible
[1:30:15] see
[1:30:17] you use an example to see what the true
[1:30:20] is going to be when it gets there
[1:30:24] my hand makes a shadow right
[1:30:27] you remember the story
[1:30:30] I see my shadow on the wall
[1:30:34] of my hand
[1:30:35] I know what my hand will look like
[1:30:40] but I can only see the shadow
[1:30:44] to start with
[1:30:48] the Bible is a prophecy
[1:30:53] an example an illustration
[1:30:57] and all of them things happen to Israel
[1:31:00] for our example
[1:31:03] amen that we fall not after the same
[1:31:05] example of unbelief right
[1:31:10] but which is the most important
[1:31:13] the example of something or what is
[1:31:16] typing or speaking of
[1:31:18] which is most important
[1:31:21] well I don't really know I don't have to
[1:31:23] know all about this type from genotypes
[1:31:24] and this type of
[1:31:26] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:31:27] period anyway so just get on go and
[1:31:29] forget it
[1:31:31] that's not being mean or sarcastic
[1:31:33] that's telling it like it is it's time
[1:31:35] to quit playing
[1:31:40] everybody's talking about that we need
[1:31:42] to Rejoice we need to be upward I agree
[1:31:45] with you
[1:31:48] well how come 50 years ain't brought
[1:31:50] people up
[1:31:52] they took them down
[1:31:57] you can preach yours out and scream and
[1:31:59] holler people start screaming all them
[1:32:01] shouting
[1:32:03] is it done any good
[1:32:08] and hey I believe in everybody
[1:32:13] but I believe like I believe it's the
[1:32:14] way the prophet said it he said just
[1:32:17] make sure if you jump up now
[1:32:19] that you live right when you land
[1:32:23] right you come back down make sure you
[1:32:26] live right
[1:32:28] yeah
[1:32:30] because you know what I'm talking about
[1:32:31] people shout Glory Hallelujah boy they
[1:32:33] just run and the emotional people are
[1:32:35] the worst sinners in the crowd
[1:32:37] right you don't like that
[1:32:41] sorry
[1:32:43] that you think about life and people and
[1:32:47] you'll see what I'm talking about and
[1:32:48] know it was right among you in your own
[1:32:50] churches and things
[1:32:52] the ones that shouted and screamed in
[1:32:53] hollered has now gone out of the message
[1:32:58] right
[1:33:04] I love to shout and scream and holler
[1:33:07] but I want to know what I'm hollering
[1:33:09] about
[1:33:12] I want something anchored down in the
[1:33:14] word
[1:33:17] Paul
[1:33:18] was using marriage and divorce
[1:33:22] as an example
[1:33:24] for the greater portion
[1:33:32] that's one president said it tell me
[1:33:33] what
[1:33:39] he said Paul is illustrating this like
[1:33:43] imagine divorce we said this is the
[1:33:46] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[1:33:54] now let me explain that and then it'll
[1:33:56] take me about three months to preach it
[1:33:58] okay
[1:34:02] all right
[1:34:03] you could be totally free of your
[1:34:06] marital situation
[1:34:11] right
[1:34:13] because you believe it you could be not
[1:34:15] guilty
[1:34:16] of those things
[1:34:19] and be totally free
[1:34:27] how come we're still here after 50 years
[1:34:29] after it was said
[1:34:36] this is only some assessing simple
[1:34:38] questions that's all I want to know
[1:34:43] see we take it that Paul is speaking on
[1:34:46] imagine divorce and typing it by law and
[1:34:48] Grace that's not what he's doing
[1:34:53] that's not what brother Brown have done
[1:34:55] in indivisible Union
[1:35:02] he was taken marriage and divorce at the
[1:35:05] top
[1:35:07] and illustrating it
[1:35:12] his law and Grace
[1:35:15] are the invisible Union if you went in
[1:35:17] his wordings
[1:35:22] see then the entire Bible is a prophecy
[1:35:26] speaking of the end time
[1:35:30] when this message would come
[1:35:33] for you and I
[1:35:38] how many people do you think went home
[1:35:39] free the day that he spoke on the grace
[1:35:41] of marriage and divorce
[1:35:44] when I wouldn't have wanted said it he
[1:35:46] did he said it in that message and I
[1:35:48] gave it to you I don't know how many
[1:35:49] times he said it's got to be revealed to
[1:35:53] you
[1:35:58] blessed God I went there with three
[1:36:01] wives I come home I just had one that
[1:36:03] great prophet of course he was a little
[1:36:04] wrong here and he was a little wrong
[1:36:06] there and he needed to be straightened
[1:36:07] out there and I know better about than
[1:36:09] he does
[1:36:13] remember I put a whole service on that
[1:36:15] really too
[1:36:19] that if we can't put our whole heart on
[1:36:21] this message
[1:36:23] and we're looking for somebody else to
[1:36:26] come forth or whatever
[1:36:30] then our dependence is not upon what the
[1:36:32] prophet said
[1:36:37] and if we think brother random was wrong
[1:36:39] here and wrong dire and
[1:36:42] we ought to be following you
[1:36:45] could if you can straighten the prophet
[1:36:46] out you got to be greater than he was
[1:36:49] is that sensible
[1:36:57] see then Paul is using
[1:37:00] according to brother random and what we
[1:37:01] read imagine divorce as an example
[1:37:06] that her husband has got to be dead and
[1:37:10] that a man is bound by the law as long
[1:37:13] as he liveth
[1:37:18] we're just getting into invisible union
[1:37:21] now so don't worry about it
[1:37:25] Paul said a man is bound by the law as
[1:37:28] long as he liveth but if he be dead
[1:37:37] and said the woman is bound
[1:37:39] as long as her husband liveth
[1:37:43] but said if her husband be dead she's to
[1:37:46] marry with free to marry again
[1:37:49] only in the Lord
[1:37:58] so we're putting marriage and divorce as
[1:38:01] the
[1:38:03] antetop
[1:38:05] and all the rest of the Bible is a type
[1:38:10] and we got it exactly backwards
[1:38:11] according to Paul according to brother
[1:38:12] Branham
[1:38:14] all right
[1:38:15] according to brother Dale I just read it
[1:38:18] we read Paul and what he said we read
[1:38:20] right around what he was saying
[1:38:31] if we could just get that straightened
[1:38:33] out on marriage and divorce we'd be
[1:38:34] ready to go
[1:38:40] yeah well been 50 years
[1:38:42] pretty good amount of time to straighten
[1:38:44] out things
[1:38:48] you think so
[1:38:51] I'm honest Church there seriously please
[1:38:54] I don't throw off on nobody I don't
[1:38:56] condemn nobody
[1:38:58] because none of us you're going to find
[1:38:59] out when we get to the invisible Union
[1:39:00] you're going to find out that none of us
[1:39:02] can look down on anybody else
[1:39:04] and if you think you can you're the
[1:39:06] garbage can
[1:39:14] but listen Church
[1:39:18] if what I'm saying is right look what
[1:39:20] you're talking about
[1:39:23] that Paul is using marriage and divorce
[1:39:26] to give an example
[1:39:29] or speak of something or illustrate it
[1:39:35] of long Grace
[1:39:41] and brother random is using it
[1:39:45] in The Invisible Union
[1:39:49] and said I'm not talking about you women
[1:39:53] what you are between you and God
[1:39:56] he said I'm talking about Christ in the
[1:39:58] church
[1:40:02] you could be holy pure and righteous as
[1:40:04] I said a moment ago
[1:40:07] and didn't need one ounce of the grace
[1:40:09] of marriage and divorce
[1:40:11] did that put you in rapture
[1:40:14] no what we're saying is we want you to
[1:40:17] get straight
[1:40:19] right
[1:40:21] come on
[1:40:26] folks we came into the message when they
[1:40:28] preached is your wife worthy of the
[1:40:29] Gospel
[1:40:32] I'm going to run preach the message is
[1:40:34] your life worthy of the gospel and all
[1:40:36] the preachers were preaching is your
[1:40:37] wife worthy to gospel preacher get up
[1:40:39] and say we get them women lined up we'll
[1:40:41] be ready to go
[1:40:44] I got this message down in Walmart
[1:40:48] I'm not kidding
[1:40:54] do you want me to explain that part
[1:40:59] the preacher got up and preached it and
[1:41:02] we heard him
[1:41:03] you probably heard him and didn't pay no
[1:41:05] attention to it
[1:41:07] sorry
[1:41:09] he said I didn't have nothing but I was
[1:41:11] down in Walmart walking around
[1:41:14] and said it come to me and I got this
[1:41:16] message well I'm not saying it didn't
[1:41:19] but I wonder what he was looking at
[1:41:22] well not only can preach about women's
[1:41:23] clothes
[1:41:25] and hiring stuff that's all he preached
[1:41:28] about I'm sorry
[1:41:33] and he preached had come to Pulpit said
[1:41:36] women shall be saved in childbearing
[1:41:40] and just stop never explain the rest of
[1:41:42] the scripture
[1:41:45] I asked him later outside I said would
[1:41:47] you mind quoting the rest of that
[1:41:48] scripture he said why did I fret the
[1:41:49] scripture I said quote the rest of it
[1:41:52] where it says if she continuing the
[1:41:54] faith
[1:41:58] but of course
[1:42:00] know-it-all smart alec
[1:42:04] I'm sorry
[1:42:07] we'll tell you one thing about it it'll
[1:42:08] be off of my hands when we get to her
[1:42:14] but you see people that fool around
[1:42:16] sleep and they do everything else and
[1:42:17] then
[1:42:18] say well brother Dale said so and so you
[1:42:21] better be able to prove what you're
[1:42:22] talking about around here because we got
[1:42:23] the tapes left
[1:42:26] I've used that before and I'll use it
[1:42:28] anytime you say I said so and so we'll
[1:42:31] get that tape and plate if I said it
[1:42:32] I'll apologize if I didn't say it you
[1:42:35] are a liar
[1:42:37] I don't mind it
[1:42:42] but listen Church
[1:42:46] let me just say something real simple
[1:42:53] now please listen
[1:42:56] and run around and preach the grace of
[1:42:58] marriage and divorce
[1:43:01] he made an astounding statement that
[1:43:05] always wondered why he said it like he
[1:43:07] did
[1:43:10] he said the Lord told him
[1:43:19] he said tell them to go on as they are
[1:43:23] is that
[1:43:24] what he said did we just read that maybe
[1:43:26] 10 times during the marriage and
[1:43:27] divorcement
[1:43:29] he said tell them to go on as they are
[1:43:34] don't do this again
[1:43:37] but to go on as they are
[1:43:41] a man later said brother Branham said
[1:43:43] you forgave them people sins
[1:43:47] he said that's not far out
[1:43:50] he said that's actually what happened
[1:43:51] right
[1:43:53] right you need that quote
[1:43:55] he said that's actually what happened
[1:44:01] but I want you to show me in marriage
[1:44:02] and divorce
[1:44:07] come on
[1:44:08] out there internet here anywhere I want
[1:44:10] you to show me on marriage and divorce
[1:44:12] that brother Branham owned the book
[1:44:14] marriage and divorce ever talked about
[1:44:18] the woman being justified
[1:44:27] you want me out of this Pulpit send me
[1:44:30] the quote
[1:44:32] I don't mind sitting down
[1:44:34] because I'm tired
[1:44:38] tired of foolishness
[1:44:41] of people
[1:44:43] in their sissified way of quotings and
[1:44:46] doings and manipulating and deceiving
[1:44:49] the poor old women
[1:44:53] I wouldn't the one that said it a woman
[1:44:54] was a thousand times easier more to be
[1:44:56] deceived than a man
[1:44:58] of course you women don't like that
[1:45:01] how many I ain't gonna race around how
[1:45:04] many of them would you even admit it
[1:45:05] down in your heart that that Prophet was
[1:45:07] right when he said you're a thousand
[1:45:09] times more easier to be deceived
[1:45:16] why are you trying to be women preachers
[1:45:18] then
[1:45:23] okay
[1:45:27] brother random never said on marriage
[1:45:29] and divorce
[1:45:32] you're Justified for what you've done I
[1:45:34] set you free
[1:45:37] I want to quote
[1:45:41] he said go on As You Are
[1:45:45] now we don't believe that he was meaning
[1:45:47] go on as you are you had four wives and
[1:45:50] you got here and you go back home you
[1:45:51] got four right we don't believe that
[1:45:55] no
[1:45:57] they went home with one
[1:46:02] to a polygamous and have a lot of
[1:46:04] trouble he wasn't even talking to
[1:46:05] polygamous people in marriage and
[1:46:07] divorce now you tell me he was and I'll
[1:46:09] tell you you're a lying hypocrite
[1:46:13] he was talking to True Believers because
[1:46:15] he said this is for my father was only
[1:46:17] not a bunch of polygamists
[1:46:22] you know what I'm saying on that right
[1:46:24] he was not talking about the world and
[1:46:27] the polygamy people
[1:46:28] you're talking about people he said
[1:46:30] sitting there honest sincere people
[1:46:31] thinking what will I do do I divorce
[1:46:34] them do I go home well that happens
[1:46:38] he said God said tell them to go on as
[1:46:39] they are
[1:46:48] haven't you never wondered about this
[1:46:49] quote go ahead and pull up number eight
[1:46:52] haven't you never wondered what this
[1:46:54] quote is sayeth
[1:47:01] from the invisible Union
[1:47:03] paragraph 77-78
[1:47:09] but because she was cast over in that
[1:47:11] side she has also been given a sacred
[1:47:14] charge from God
[1:47:16] my Redemption
[1:47:18] she's got character that she must not
[1:47:20] defile
[1:47:21] if she would marry them now what's he
[1:47:23] using natural woman right
[1:47:26] she is defiled for a lifetime
[1:47:28] no matter how much she is Forgiven
[1:47:35] come on
[1:47:37] she can't be justified
[1:47:50] come on
[1:47:53] I'll strike that in a little bit got a
[1:47:55] scripture on that in a few minutes she
[1:47:58] can be forgiven for her defilement
[1:48:01] but she cannot be justified
[1:48:05] in this life
[1:48:10] it's always with her
[1:48:16] she cannot be justified in this life
[1:48:18] it's always with her notice now she's
[1:48:21] been given this she may be forgiven
[1:48:24] but not justify
[1:48:35] what do you think he's saying
[1:48:41] well brought it down what it was when we
[1:48:43] went to our marriage and divorced and I
[1:48:44] went back home I was justified I want to
[1:48:46] quote
[1:48:47] that's all I want
[1:48:57] in this life
[1:49:00] all right
[1:49:02] in this life you can't be it'll always
[1:49:05] be with her
[1:49:06] right we're not Catholics
[1:49:09] come on
[1:49:12] Catholics believe that a woman goes and
[1:49:14] she lives in an adultery and she does
[1:49:16] this or has babies or whatever she does
[1:49:18] she ready to get married she goes down
[1:49:20] to the priest the priest goes to of
[1:49:22] course you got to give a lot of money
[1:49:23] I'm sure but the priest goes through a
[1:49:25] lot he turns around and sprinkled
[1:49:26] thoughts on her turn around send her
[1:49:27] back makes her a virgin
[1:49:31] that's not me read your own get your
[1:49:35] read it
[1:49:36] I get mine by reading
[1:49:39] you want that I'll give it to you on the
[1:49:40] prophet's message because he's the one
[1:49:42] who said it
[1:49:43] that's the way I know it's right
[1:49:45] he said that's what they do
[1:49:48] man down the country not too long ago a
[1:49:51] few years back
[1:49:52] he had a girl in his church wanting to
[1:49:54] get married she couldn't get married
[1:49:55] because he'd have some problems he spoke
[1:49:57] virginity back into her wound
[1:50:02] he said okay for her to marry
[1:50:05] now I'm not that dumb you may be
[1:50:11] can you women maybe a thousand times
[1:50:12] more able to be deceived but I I don't
[1:50:15] believe you're that bad
[1:50:20] come on I don't believe you're that dumb
[1:50:27] but that's the way the Catholics
[1:50:28] believes it can be done
[1:50:31] you can't put back the virginity that's
[1:50:34] been destroyed
[1:50:35] brother Brown said to you woman he said
[1:50:38] and you boys he said you take that woman
[1:50:41] to your breasts you want this quote he
[1:50:43] said she makes an imprint that no other
[1:50:46] woman will ever fit
[1:50:51] now your boys Crow you me and Crow
[1:50:55] and think about the virginities you
[1:50:57] stole from girls and things
[1:51:00] you see that's why brother Dale don't
[1:51:01] play it on neither side
[1:51:03] I know I'm blunt and plain and sometimes
[1:51:05] they'll say things it's just
[1:51:07] outlandishly
[1:51:09] sounds bad but I'm trying to save your
[1:51:12] soul
[1:51:13] what you think about me is no problem
[1:51:17] I go home at night and I cry and pray
[1:51:19] Lord ain't there some way that I could
[1:51:21] preach this without having to say things
[1:51:27] brother said I got pages in here of
[1:51:29] snakes crawling over women and having
[1:51:38] and we don't think he was too mean
[1:51:43] did you see Church
[1:51:47] marriage and divorce is not the tops
[1:51:55] law and Grace is that Apex
[1:52:01] brother random didn't have to be
[1:52:03] forgiven on marriage and divorced in the
[1:52:04] natural
[1:52:05] but he was carrying a Baptist Bible
[1:52:08] quote him converting them to a Baptist
[1:52:12] Faith quoting him
[1:52:16] and him a prophet the whole time
[1:52:22] I see his words
[1:52:27] he said I used to think Jesus loved me
[1:52:29] and God hated me
[1:52:32] that's his words
[1:52:34] he said but I found out it's the same
[1:52:36] person
[1:52:39] he found that out by the revealed word
[1:52:45] to see girls there's no way you lose
[1:52:47] that virginity there's no way to put
[1:52:48] that virginity back
[1:52:51] that's why you're here in this world
[1:53:00] when we get into the message a little
[1:53:02] father
[1:53:04] you'll find him saying
[1:53:06] she's not only forgiven but said she's
[1:53:09] Justified
[1:53:11] that's why I want you to read that
[1:53:13] invisible Union over and over and over
[1:53:15] but it's got to be put together
[1:53:17] correctly
[1:53:19] just like what I've tried to put
[1:53:20] together today for you correctly
[1:53:26] marriage and divorce
[1:53:27] is not the Apex of our Christian
[1:53:30] experience
[1:53:34] it's law and Grace
[1:53:40] now where do you hear people talking
[1:53:42] about law and Grace
[1:53:44] where do you remember talking about
[1:53:45] marriage and divorce
[1:53:47] I'm just honest now that's out there on
[1:53:49] the internet
[1:53:50] but where is it
[1:53:53] always afraid of it pray to what
[1:53:58] afraid to expose how dumb they are
[1:54:06] as you see Church a greater portion
[1:54:10] justification is a portion of the Holy
[1:54:12] Ghost
[1:54:13] but it's not the greater portion
[1:54:15] sanctification is a portion but it's not
[1:54:18] the greater portion the baptism of the
[1:54:20] Holy Ghost is a greater portion then
[1:54:22] you've got a statue of a perfect man to
[1:54:24] grow and to get out of here to be in all
[1:54:26] of it
[1:54:27] to be a greater portion
[1:54:31] marriage and divorce is only used as a
[1:54:34] portion
[1:54:36] because that's only for the bodies and
[1:54:39] things
[1:54:44] but the greater portion is Law and Grace
[1:54:50] because we'll find out then the old
[1:54:53] husband must be dead
[1:54:57] that's for both male and female
[1:55:01] you bunch of males don't read invisible
[1:55:03] Union and think he's only talking about
[1:55:05] the women he said I'm not talking about
[1:55:07] you women
[1:55:11] he said I'm only illustrating it
[1:55:15] I'm only giving you an example
[1:55:23] you know marriage and divorce he said go
[1:55:24] on As You Are
[1:55:27] one invisible Union
[1:55:30] is where he said
[1:55:32] you're not only forgiven
[1:55:34] but you're Justified
[1:55:38] but you know what the day we go out of
[1:55:40] here in Rapture everybody around is
[1:55:42] going to know whether you've got two
[1:55:43] wives two husbands or whatever you've
[1:55:45] done right
[1:55:49] but I ain't worried about what everybody
[1:55:50] thinks about me around there I'm sorry I
[1:55:53] what I've done in my life I've done
[1:55:55] that's done I cannot erase that
[1:56:01] but I can sure cry for Grace
[1:56:07] I can sure cry for Grace
[1:56:10] Amazing Grace
[1:56:15] the greater portion
[1:56:18] is not the grace of American divorce
[1:56:21] it's the grace to separates us from the
[1:56:24] law
[1:56:25] that we could be married to Jesus Christ
[1:56:31] come on brother
[1:56:38] think on these things
[1:56:46] you say well brother Dave if you just
[1:56:47] had a better way of explaining yourself
[1:56:50] well I admit that
[1:56:53] I agree with that I wish I had
[1:57:01] but you remember I've been preaching to
[1:57:03] people for a long time
[1:57:07] trying to get people to see
[1:57:11] not marriage and divorce
[1:57:15] but Lauren Gray
[1:57:19] now I'll give you the a point to think
[1:57:21] on to Wednesday
[1:57:23] see then
[1:57:25] marriage and then the new birth
[1:57:29] sets your soul free
[1:57:33] you agree
[1:57:34] the new birth sets your soul free
[1:57:38] your marriage and divorce to set your
[1:57:40] body free
[1:57:48] but what about the old denominational
[1:57:49] husband
[1:57:52] right
[1:57:54] my Lord you think about brother Brown
[1:57:57] standing there screaming and hollering
[1:57:58] on the invisible Union that was not at
[1:58:00] the Tabernacle that was actually under
[1:58:01] Jack Moore's church or somewhere
[1:58:05] he was preaching on that
[1:58:07] and he was screaming to them people
[1:58:09] about organized religion
[1:58:11] and everybody's setting their ball home
[1:58:13] to an organized religion
[1:58:19] right
[1:58:20] everybody that I belonged to one
[1:58:26] but how many have walked out the door
[1:58:28] and said
[1:58:30] foreign
[1:58:39] the Bible
[1:58:40] there to read I believe that's right now
[1:58:42] if I'm wrong you quoted right
[1:58:44] said he said after what he's just got
[1:58:46] through saying says we've got to get out
[1:58:47] of the church get the church has got to
[1:58:49] get out of the message in and we got to
[1:58:50] get out of the church
[1:58:54] now how many people heard Prophet
[1:58:56] screaming and hollering about organized
[1:58:58] religion but how many of them got up
[1:59:00] behind him and said I ain't no Church of
[1:59:02] God no more
[1:59:06] come on
[1:59:14] the new birth is first
[1:59:18] marriage and divorce is second
[1:59:21] invisible Union is lost
[1:59:27] you realize he was telling those people
[1:59:29] that they were married to a
[1:59:30] denominational religion and her old
[1:59:32] husband was still alive and they would
[1:59:33] holler and amen
[1:59:40] how do you think he felt
[1:59:45] how do you think he felt
[1:59:50] he walked out of there and not a person
[1:59:52] come to him and said
[1:59:54] I'm not a Baptist no more
[1:59:57] I'm not a Methodist I'm not a
[1:59:58] Pentecostal I'm not a
[2:00:00] I'm going to follow the light
[2:00:05] no
[2:00:07] they didn't believe what he said
[2:00:14] that's why he said on the marriage and
[2:00:15] divorce he said this is for my followers
[2:00:17] only
[2:00:19] the ones who followed this message he
[2:00:21] said
[2:00:29] well we got Brothers
[2:00:33] what
[2:00:37] created me include a heart page five
[2:00:39] five thirty nines created me a clean
[2:00:42] heart that's what I need don't you
[2:00:53] oh God
[2:00:56] and renew a right Spirit
[2:01:00] Within Me
[2:01:05] creating me you're a queen
[2:01:16] and renew a right Spirit
[2:01:19] Within Me
[2:01:25] cast me not away from
[2:01:36] not that Holy Spirit from me
[2:01:44] restore unto me
[2:01:48] I'm gonna get a prayer called
[2:02:09] we ask you to just go and be with Acer
[2:02:11] now let everything be okay bring him
[2:02:14] back safe home may he see your presence
[2:02:17] being with him because her mother would
[2:02:19] be enough to ask we love you and we
[2:02:23] thank you in Jesus name
[2:02:27] oh God
[2:02:30] anybody else would just have a knee
[2:02:40] cast me not
[2:02:46] alone
[2:02:58] crack off her husband he's been having a
[2:03:01] lot of
[2:03:02] blood pressure problem
[2:03:05] from the heart skipping
[2:03:09] well let's just believe it
[2:03:12] you know I remember somebody
[2:03:16] there's always had a lot of problems
[2:03:18] about believing that they were
[2:03:21] because they'd never been healed and
[2:03:23] never been delivered never been
[2:03:28] and I believe God come on the scene
[2:03:31] took her through a whole bunch of tests
[2:03:33] and everything that they thought was
[2:03:34] really bad
[2:03:37] well apply that the same to Tom
[2:03:40] okay
[2:03:41] just applied
[2:03:44] okay
[2:03:45] anybody else
[2:03:59] come in let's believe
[2:04:12] our club we send this prayer cloth
[2:04:15] believing that whatever be taken care of
[2:04:18] and all will be well we love you and we
[2:04:21] thank you in Jesus name
[2:04:24] can I say something
[2:04:26] foreign
[2:04:38] as I said how many people
[2:04:42] the day the prophet screamed out about
[2:04:44] organized religion how many walked out
[2:04:46] away from their churches
[2:04:48] no they went back thinking they were
[2:04:50] right
[2:04:54] I'm telling this is God's honest truth
[2:04:57] because it's been told so many times to
[2:04:59] 90 percent of you have already heard me
[2:05:01] say it
[2:05:03] the day I walked out of the Baptist
[2:05:05] Church
[2:05:06] I went to a church in this message
[2:05:10] I said that day
[2:05:12] I said God got me out of the
[2:05:15] denomination
[2:05:18] now I want that denomination out of me
[2:05:27] when what goods it done yet
[2:05:30] I think we all need just a plain old
[2:05:33] repentance
[2:05:35] you say Lord
[2:05:38] save me
[2:05:41] Save Me From Myself
[2:05:51] what hopes did those people have that
[2:05:53] day that Prophet spoke invisible Union
[2:05:57] they had the hope of Salvation and where
[2:06:00] did it go
[2:06:03] right on back to their Church
[2:06:45] thank you
[2:07:01] thank you
[2:07:26] a lot of times we don't need prior we
[2:07:29] just need to keep on doing what we're
[2:07:30] doing
[2:07:33] right I mean I get something working I
[2:07:37] don't like to change I don't know what
[2:07:39] that word is bipolar or whatever they
[2:07:41] call it you know you don't like changes
[2:07:43] I don't either
[2:07:45] you know if I'm doing something and it
[2:07:48] works I want to keep on doing it that
[2:07:49] way
[2:07:52] come show me it's a better way I said
[2:07:53] okay I'll learn that later
[2:07:56] his brothers that used to work with me
[2:07:57] adorable there they know for certain
[2:07:59] what I do they'd send me down I know 40
[2:08:01] I had to learn 40 something jobs not to
[2:08:04] be able to just have we learned I had to
[2:08:06] run them I had to go to them after the
[2:08:08] line would start to take that job over
[2:08:10] and had to run 40 something different
[2:08:11] jobs in our area
[2:08:13] and uh
[2:08:15] they know what I do I'd go up there in a
[2:08:17] man to train me I'd do it the best way
[2:08:18] that I could brother dick if he trained
[2:08:20] me on the job I'd done what he told me
[2:08:22] to do
[2:08:23] but then when he got through
[2:08:26] you know I'd do it
[2:08:28] but then I'd start learning shortcuts
[2:08:32] the first thing you know I'd be just
[2:08:33] standing there laughing and talking and
[2:08:35] just you know just
[2:08:37] running a job just like a top
[2:08:40] well that kind of job that kind of
[2:08:41] change I don't mind you know it's
[2:08:43] something to open up
[2:08:45] but to start off I learned the way he
[2:08:47] said it well
[2:08:49] brother mulch spent a lot of time
[2:08:51] pounding this old head of mine this word
[2:08:55] and I learned the best I could learn
[2:08:57] I thank God for him
[2:09:00] never had an ill thought in my life
[2:09:02] about him
[2:09:04] because he taught me the word
[2:09:07] but it come at times
[2:09:10] and I had other brothers that really
[2:09:12] talked the world up
[2:09:15] that I walked with and preached with
[2:09:18] but it seemed like it's always been
[2:09:23] you need to walk alone
[2:09:28] well
[2:09:30] I love people but sometimes I Walk Alone
[2:09:35] not just myself
[2:09:38] but see that a way that I'm not
[2:09:40] dependent upon somebody else
[2:09:42] but I'm still thinking about all that he
[2:09:44] taught me how to do this and he taught
[2:09:45] me how to do that
[2:09:47] thank God for every preacher that I've
[2:09:49] ever said unto everybody for the Baptist
[2:09:51] all the way through that helped me
[2:09:53] to learn about Jesus Christ
[2:09:59] that I have to walk along
[2:10:02] and sometimes that's hard
[2:10:06] because you love Fellowship
[2:10:08] you love people
[2:10:12] I ain't worried about that part
[2:10:14] I'm just concerned about serving him
[2:10:18] being what he wants me to be
[2:10:22] what do you think about it
[2:10:25] come on brother how we pray we then
[2:10:26] brother Aaron has something he wants to
[2:10:28] say but
[2:10:32] I said
[2:10:50] foreign
[2:11:08] we just asked you Lord
[2:11:14] and to change things
[2:11:16] because we believe you
[2:11:21] no matter how far away our kids
[2:11:23] grandkids great grandkids whatever they
[2:11:25] are know how far they will go away from
[2:11:27] us Lord that still that link is tied
[2:11:30] there and that love
[2:11:33] we just ask you father to reach down and
[2:11:37] touch
[2:11:39] because
[2:11:41] his love he's cherished
[2:11:45] you bring her back
[2:11:47] we believe you father our brothers come
[2:11:51] tonight to just layer on the altar
[2:11:52] before you and that's what we lay we lay
[2:11:55] her there Lord for you to work a work
[2:11:59] and to bring our sister back forward
[2:12:03] we love you and we believe you we thank
[2:12:07] you in Jesus is your name
[2:12:15] don't believe rather than see anybody
[2:12:18] else before we just met
[2:12:34] I've been in a lot of hospital rooms and
[2:12:37] things where people were dying and some
[2:12:40] of them went on and died but I can't
[2:12:41] pray for somebody to die
[2:12:49] sister asked me
[2:12:51] said would it be all right for me to
[2:12:53] pray that that person passed on I said
[2:12:56] I can't pray that away
[2:13:00] I said we can pray and know and believe
[2:13:02] God touches the person they will God we
[2:13:05] will die but I can't pray for God
[2:13:10] take somebody's life
[2:13:12] and I can pray for restoration
[2:13:15] I can play for pray for restoring for
[2:13:18] people
[2:13:20] and no matter how far those kids go
[2:13:24] let that love that's in your heart go
[2:13:26] out to our tour
[2:13:28] no matter what
[2:13:31] you love them
[2:13:35] you love them
[2:13:45] you're the Aaron's got something he
[2:13:48] wants to say so
[2:13:56] a little something on it share with you
[2:14:00] I wrote a few things down Wade always
[2:14:02] told me
[2:14:04] that not to give the War and Peace
[2:14:05] version of it so I just want to take
[2:14:09] just a few minutes
[2:14:11] and you know most most of you know that
[2:14:14] I got laid off at the end of last year
[2:14:16] and I was looking for a job I was out
[2:14:18] I've worked for a month and then I found
[2:14:21] a job working over here
[2:14:22] the Toyota Denzel Place tag and
[2:14:25] Pendergrass
[2:14:26] and I applied to the University of
[2:14:28] Georgia
[2:14:29] and I've been over there for probably a
[2:14:32] month
[2:14:33] and lady in Human Resources I was
[2:14:35] talking to her and and she asked me said
[2:14:37] why and I she asked me about my
[2:14:40] background was and I told her and she
[2:14:41] said why are you in logistics and not in
[2:14:43] maintenance
[2:14:44] and I said that's where they put me and
[2:14:46] you just have to work where they put you
[2:14:47] I mean but she asked for my resume so I
[2:14:50] gave her my resume well I didn't hear
[2:14:52] nothing else from them
[2:14:53] and uh
[2:14:59] just listen to what brother Jonathan had
[2:15:02] to say this weekend
[2:15:04] sometimes you get desperate you get
[2:15:06] worked up about things
[2:15:11] but it's on the line the other day and
[2:15:13] working I just prayed
[2:15:17] you know I'm not going to worry about it
[2:15:18] just putting God's hands because he
[2:15:20] knows what he's doing
[2:15:21] and sometimes that's the problem we get
[2:15:23] in the way right
[2:15:26] well
[2:15:28] I got an email from UGA last week I
[2:15:31] didn't get a job from
[2:15:33] and I was like well Lord didn't want me
[2:15:35] to be there right but tags had eight
[2:15:38] positions for over eight maintenance
[2:15:40] positions open for over a year now
[2:15:42] they've got only got three left
[2:15:44] well when I got my got my 90 days in a
[2:15:48] tag I applied for maintenance
[2:15:51] and uh
[2:15:53] I told them it worked that I didn't get
[2:15:55] the job at UGA
[2:15:57] and my
[2:15:59] my team leader
[2:16:01] he really went to a bat for me
[2:16:04] and they said well go to talk to the
[2:16:06] maintenance supervisor named Herman
[2:16:09] he said go talk to him
[2:16:10] a big tall black guy so I went up front
[2:16:13] I wouldn't talk to him he said well you
[2:16:15] need to take the maintenance assessment
[2:16:16] to find out your background your your
[2:16:19] skill level and everything
[2:16:20] and uh
[2:16:22] I took that
[2:16:24] it's past Wednesday afternoon I went and
[2:16:26] took that
[2:16:28] Wednesday
[2:16:29] when I went in Thursday morning my team
[2:16:31] leader told me said you've got to
[2:16:32] interview with maintenance
[2:16:36] 9 15.
[2:16:37] well they got moved to two o'clock and I
[2:16:39] went in interviewed at two o'clock
[2:16:42] at four o'clock it was after four
[2:16:45] o'clock Friday afternoon my
[2:16:47] uh
[2:16:48] team leader come and told me May 28th I
[2:16:51] start from magnets attack
[2:16:53] yep
[2:16:57] well I just want to thank you all so
[2:16:58] much for your prayers
[2:17:03] and like sister Johnny
[2:17:05] we've talked about it a number of times
[2:17:07] and
[2:17:09] I said well if I don't hear from him
[2:17:10] about it today I'll hear about it more
[2:17:12] next week whenever it's going to be
[2:17:16] but uh
[2:17:17] I just thank the Lord that has finally
[2:17:19] come along
[2:17:21] and it's not always what you know it's
[2:17:23] who you know when
[2:17:24] I got a good buddy of mine named Daniel
[2:17:26] and he was a team leader in maintenance
[2:17:29] now he's an engineer at tag
[2:17:33] and you know a lot of it's amazing
[2:17:36] there's people that are qualified there
[2:17:37] but you know I've talked to them and
[2:17:39] they said well I've not heard anything
[2:17:40] from maintenance I've applied twice in
[2:17:42] the Harding thing for maintenance
[2:17:45] I've been there a lot less time than the
[2:17:47] rest of them
[2:17:49] but Daniel put in a word for me the
[2:17:50] first thing they done the first thing
[2:17:52] the question they asked me when I went
[2:17:54] in for the interview they said how do
[2:17:55] you know Daniel
[2:18:00] and they told me you know because I
[2:18:01] talked to him before
[2:18:03] and you know they put a good word for me
[2:18:05] but you know God works everything out
[2:18:08] because he not only what you know but
[2:18:10] God puts people in places to work
[2:18:13] everything out for you and people were
[2:18:16] were really amazed at how quick it was
[2:18:18] because some of them they have to wait a
[2:18:21] while to get an interview but I took the
