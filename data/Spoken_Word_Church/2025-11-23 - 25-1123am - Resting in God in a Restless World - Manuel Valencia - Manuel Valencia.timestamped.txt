[0:00] being with you. So, I'm going to go
[0:01] ahead and uh be teaching today on a very
[0:05] uh very restful topic. So, pray that you
[0:10] enjoy your your time here in Sunday
[0:12] school lesson. So, let me get this here.
[0:17] All right. Praise the Lord. So, um let's
[0:19] pray here while we're sitting down.
[0:20] Heavenly Father, we want to bow our
[0:22] heads to you, Lord, to the dust of the
[0:23] earth where we've been taken from.
[0:25] Father, we want to ask that you will be
[0:26] with us, Father, as we prepare for
[0:30] service, Lord. Thank you for the message
[0:32] that's gone forward. Thank you for the
[0:33] Sunday school teaching, Father, that
[0:35] will go before. Uh I pray that you will
[0:37] prepare us for worshiping, for praying,
[0:39] for service, Father, and for the
[0:41] preaching of your precious word, that
[0:43] you inspire the minister, Father, that
[0:45] you would just put, Father, that
[0:46] anointing, Father, to all the the words
[0:49] and give it life to us. And I pray uh
[0:51] that you would prepare the way for a
[0:54] good time today of fellowship in your
[0:56] word in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[0:59] Amen.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Today I'm going to be
[1:01] speaking on rest. [clears throat]
[1:04] &gt;&gt; So
[1:06] many rest to our souls, right?
[1:09] And it's a it's a very settling thing to
[1:12] have this age,
[1:14] to have it from the inside out, and to
[1:16] have a rest about where we came from,
[1:18] the destination, where we're going. You
[1:20] know, we we do live in a world that is
[1:22] is raging all the more, sometimes our
[1:24] own body, sometimes our own
[1:26] circumstances,
[1:28] and just everything. And it seems like
[1:29] the more I'm time goes on, the more that
[1:32] we see the struggle, the um
[1:37] the more I've been able to mature, the
[1:39] more I'm realizing that there's just
[1:40] really a lot to contend with, right? But
[1:42] one thing's for sure, right, is when
[1:44] that soul is at rest, we have that that
[1:47] precious anchor. So have you resting in
[1:49] God in a restless world
[1:52] in God's word, right? So for in Exodus
[1:54] uh 33 we know God uh spoke to Moses and
[1:57] that's when he promised that his
[1:58] presence will be there with him and he
[2:00] said my presence shall go with thee and
[2:04] I will give thee rest. So it's a rest
[2:06] that is given. It's a rest that it's you
[2:09] enter into. It's a rest that we um you
[2:12] know in Spanish they use the word
[2:13] repose. So it's a look looking at the
[2:16] differences between those two words.
[2:17] Repose is is just it's a deeper meaning
[2:20] to it. Whereas rest it could it could
[2:22] also be literal right like sleeping like
[2:25] uh like you know sitting down being
[2:27] still but this rest is is a in Spanish
[2:31] most of the times it doesn't use like
[2:32] the word rest it actually uses the word
[2:34] repose which is such a rich word to mean
[2:38] like it kind of adds more than just
[2:40] being you know still it puts all those
[2:43] together. So I'm thankful that there
[2:46] remains arrest, right? So we know in
[2:47] Hebrews 4:9 kind of goes back and forth
[2:49] because there's even a promise that that
[2:53] God swore that they would not enter into
[2:54] the rest. But we'll read to whom it's
[2:56] talking about and under what condition.
[3:00] But you know sometimes we take those
[3:01] words and and we bring bring content to
[3:03] it that of course there remainth the
[3:05] rest are for though right to the people
[3:08] of God, right? And uh it's a blessing to
[3:11] know here I was reading on Ruth how
[3:14] God rested. We know when he created and
[3:18] he loves resting. He's commanded rest in
[3:20] the the one day and seven. He's
[3:22] commanded rest one year and seven. He's
[3:24] commanded rest after the seven times
[3:26] seven. I mean seven uh times that you
[3:29] have the seven year and then you have
[3:31] the jubilee, right? But one of the
[3:34] things is for certain is is God will not
[3:36] rest until he does certain things. And I
[3:39] know he's typified here. So then in Ruth
[3:41] we have then said she sit still as Naomi
[3:45] my daughter until thou know it says
[3:50] until thou daughter it says until thou
[3:53] know how the matter will fall for the
[3:55] man will not be in rest until he have
[3:59] finished the thing this day. What a
[4:02] confidence, right? To know that that um
[4:05] the only way the Lord's going to rest is
[4:07] when he accomplished what what he wants
[4:08] to do. And then he does rest and then he
[4:10] gives us rest. Here it says in Isaiah 62
[4:13] coming forth. It says uh first verse,
[4:16] for Zion's sake, I will not hold my
[4:19] peace.
[4:20] And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest
[4:24] until the righteous thereof go forth as
[4:28] brightness and the salvation thereof as
[4:31] a lamp that burnth.
[4:35] So God God loves rest. He constituted
[4:38] rest. He's the one that um was the one
[4:41] that created it all and he was his own
[4:42] inspector, right? He saw that and he
[4:44] said that it was good and and and that's
[4:46] why he rested because things were as
[4:48] they ought to be, right? And I think
[4:51] that um he grants that to the believer,
[4:53] right? As we'll learn here a little bit,
[4:55] we'll go through the we'll learn a
[4:57] little bit about unrest, right? And one
[4:59] of the things that it takes to be able
[5:01] to when you do enter into his rest, just
[5:04] what a contrast it is and what a
[5:06] difference it is and what a stillness it
[5:08] is, particularly when we're speaking
[5:09] about the soul. So here we have um in
[5:13] first kings 8:56 it says, "Blessed be
[5:16] the Lord that hath given us given rest
[5:18] unto his people Israel according to all
[5:21] that he promised. He had not failed one
[5:24] word of all his good promise which he
[5:27] promised by the hand of Moses." Amen.
[5:32] His servant. We're so thankful we have
[5:33] that type in this age, right? where we
[5:35] have a message uh that's a promise and
[5:37] that and that a lot of people see it as
[5:39] a something to um of confusion but but
[5:42] it is a rest it is a rest brothers and
[5:46] I'll just touch you here about nine
[5:48] verses nine nine scripture verses I have
[5:50] here about what it is to be at unrest
[5:53] right because it it in order for you to
[5:56] be at rest and even know what it was is
[5:58] you had to go through the unrest in our
[5:59] life right so what I have here is in
[6:02] Jeremiah 6:16 thus Say the Lord, stand
[6:05] ye in the ways and see and ask for the
[6:09] old paths.
[6:11] Where is the good way and walk therein?
[6:15] And you shall find rest for your souls.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; But they said, we will not walk therein.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; Man, we've all had our our times. Look
[6:26] what Job said here. My bones are pierced
[6:29] in me in the night season and my senu
[6:34] take no rest. Look at Job 30:27. I've
[6:39] been here. He says, "My bowels boiled
[6:45] and rested not.
[6:48] The days of affliction prevented me." We
[6:52] know what unrest is, right? in sleeping
[6:54] or in rest in in just your emotions or
[6:57] in rest in um in your eternal
[6:59] destination.
[7:01] How is that soul going to be resting
[7:03] when there is [snorts]
[7:04] when there's no assurance? Right?
[7:06] Whether people know it or not. Psalms
[7:09] 38:3 it says, "There is no soundness in
[7:11] my flesh because of thine anger. Neither
[7:14] is there any rest any in my bones
[7:19] because of my sin."
[7:21] You know, interesting enough, I was
[7:22] meditating on this and I had to gas up
[7:24] yesterday and I went and I went to the
[7:27] gas station and then there was this song
[7:29] bad to my bones or something like that
[7:31] and I was just bad and I'm like trying
[7:32] to get away from I'm like I'm just the
[7:34] the machine was broken so I had to get
[7:36] down there and pay and it just said bad
[7:38] to the bones and I just read the
[7:39] scripture and I'm like Lord let me be
[7:41] good to the bones [laughter]
[7:43] you know it's just like there's no
[7:45] soundness in my flesh because of thine
[7:47] anger neither is there any rest in my
[7:50] bones. I mean, look at that. Even your
[7:52] bones need rest or the anointing rests,
[7:54] right? We know because of my sins. So,
[7:57] unbelief.
[7:59] But the wicked are like the troubled
[8:02] sea. I just put a little image of that
[8:05] when it cannot rest, whose waters cast
[8:08] up m and dirt. So, no good, right? And I
[8:12] threw in this proverb over here because
[8:14] I thought it was pretty fitting.
[8:16] If a wise man contended, so even if you
[8:18] try to contend right, with the foolish
[8:20] man, whether he rage or laugh, there's
[8:25] just no rest.
[8:27] Isn't that something? Makes you wonder
[8:29] why sometimes when you're speaking to
[8:30] certain persons, you you just cannot get
[8:32] to that rest.
[8:34] Help us, Lord. Right? It's a condition.
[8:36] And Hebrews it says, "And to whom swear
[8:39] he that they should not enter into his
[8:41] rest, comma,
[8:44] but to them that believeth not." You
[8:47] see, sometimes we just say, "Oh, he's
[8:48] sorry. He won't enter into his rest." Of
[8:50] course, there is no rest in unbelief.
[8:54] There's no rest in in u in us not coming
[8:57] but God's provided way right of
[8:59] atonement and of a
[9:02] provided way for for all for being
[9:05] justified
[9:07] for being then there's another rest that
[9:09] comes when we're sanctified and then
[9:11] there's another rest that comes when
[9:12] you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[9:14] fire in the soul right and then I
[9:17] believe we're promised and we already
[9:18] are believing unto receiving the
[9:20] glorification right of our body because
[9:22] we already received the first fruits
[9:23] in our in our soul. Amen.
[9:27] And and here we have in Hebrews 4:101,
[9:31] there's a lot just a few verses next.
[9:33] For he that is entered, see you have to
[9:36] enter in into his rest, he also hath
[9:40] seized from his own works, the person as
[9:44] God did from his. 11 Let us labor
[9:48] therefore to enter into that rest, lest
[9:51] any man fall after the same example of
[9:54] unbelief. There's clearly a a
[9:57] correlation where unbelief, unrest.
[9:59] Belief, rest. And the soul has two
[10:01] senses.
[10:03] Faith or sin, doubt, unbelief.
[10:06] There's either rest or no rest in the
[10:08] soul. But to have rest from sin,
[10:12] brothers, that's what the scriptures are
[10:13] talking about. That's that's to have
[10:15] rest from unbelief. You know what it's
[10:17] like to to have a rest that you just
[10:19] don't have to sin. You don't have to
[10:21] unbelieve. You don't have to disbelieve
[10:24] this message, his Bible, his word to us.
[10:28] That's a rest.
[10:30] Isaiah 14:3.
[10:33] And it shall come to pass in the day
[10:35] that the Lord shall give thee rest from
[10:39] thy sorrow, and from thy fear,
[10:43] and from the hard bondage [laughter]
[10:46] wherewin, wherein thou was made to
[10:50] serve. That's the condition that we're
[10:52] having rest from. In Isaiah
[10:55] Psalms 94, it says that thou mayest give
[10:59] him rest from the days of adversity
[11:02] until the pit be digged for the wicked.
[11:06] And then so this is how we long I
[11:08] believe that when you're going through
[11:10] the process of going from unrest to to
[11:12] rest. I remember these these scriptures
[11:15] these verses when you're saying when it
[11:16] says in Psalm 556 and I said oh that I
[11:20] had wings like a dove
[11:23] for then I will I would would I fly and
[11:27] be at rest
[11:28] &gt;&gt; just escaping it all right sometimes in
[11:31] this world of unbelief. Love is here and
[11:34] God given us that message this time. And
[11:36] God's given us that assurance that the
[11:39] scriptures are laying in the Bible
[11:40] applied right that are made alive in the
[11:43] believer. It it produces that rest that
[11:46] rest of knowing that that we have
[11:49] rapturing faith that we we are going
[11:52] through what the Bible promised.
[11:54] Jeremiah 30:10. Therefore, fear thou
[11:57] not, oh my servant Jacob, saith the
[11:59] Lord, neither be dismayed, O Israel, for
[12:02] though I, personal pronouns, will save
[12:05] thee from afar, and thy seed, a promise
[12:08] for the future, too, from the land of
[12:11] their captivity. And Jacob shall return,
[12:14] and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and
[12:18] none shall make him afraid.
[12:22] Amen. I look at this photo here. There's
[12:25] this lighthouse and there's this water.
[12:28] It's a famous photograph and there's
[12:30] this big waves and there's you could
[12:32] probably see that there's a person right
[12:33] there is standing. So that's kind of
[12:35] what it looks like when you're
[12:36] transitioning from unrest or starting to
[12:38] to be in the lighthouse, right? Starting
[12:40] to be settled on the rock.
[12:43] 2 Thessalonians
[12:45] chapter 1:7 says, "And thou and to you
[12:50] who are troubled, rest with us when the
[12:55] Lord Jesus shall be revealed
[12:58] from heaven with this mighty angels
[13:02] preparation." Amen.
[13:05] So we have this is this is my favorite
[13:07] one. This one just came alive when I
[13:10] read it for the first time that I can
[13:11] remember reading it.
[13:13] And Psalm 116:7 says, this is a prayer
[13:18] or a song. Return unto thy rest, oh my
[13:21] soul. It's like you're singing to your
[13:23] own soul, right? For the Lord hath dealt
[13:26] bountifully with thee.
[13:28] Now, we know we go through hardship, but
[13:30] it's talking about the soul. It's
[13:32] talking about that rest. The Lord has
[13:35] given us that rest in the soul when when
[13:38] there's that faith. Amen. Psalm 37:7
[13:41] says, "Rest in the Lord,
[13:44] and wait patiently for him. Fred not
[13:47] thyself because of him who prosperth in
[13:50] his way, because of the man who bringeth
[13:53] wicked devices to pass. Rest in the
[13:56] Lord." Is 32:17:18,
[14:00] "And the work of righteousness shall be
[14:03] peace." But look at the effect. and the
[14:06] effect of righteousness, quietness, and
[14:10] assurance forever.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; And my people shall dwell in a peaceable
[14:17] habitation
[14:20] and in sure dwellings and in quiet
[14:24] resting places. That's a good
[14:26] description here of of the believer's
[14:30] rest.
[14:31] I said 321 1718 18 just full of rich
[14:35] words like that's going to be the effect
[14:36] of righteousness. You're going to have a
[14:38] quietness assurance forever and you're
[14:41] going to have uh his people he said will
[14:43] have a peaceable habitation and in sure
[14:45] dwellings and in quiet resting places
[14:49] from all the noise of the world and all
[14:50] the unbelief.
[14:52] I I just remember what it's like to
[14:55] enter into that rest. And it is a
[14:58] settleness of the things that are of of
[15:01] divine value, right? Of of eternal
[15:04] value. And I'll go fast here because we
[15:06] got some really good uh more message
[15:07] quotes and scriptures to share. Psalm
[15:09] 139 1-3, it says, "Oh Lord, thou has
[15:12] searched me and known me. Thou knowest,
[15:15] so he knows your rest. Thou knowest my
[15:17] sitting down and my uprising. Thou
[15:19] understandeth my thoughts far far off.
[15:21] Thou compasseth
[15:24] that's just a way of another way of
[15:25] saying he understand my path and my
[15:27] lying. And that word lying there I know
[15:30] I read it in other verses in in Spanish
[15:31] in particular version of King James. And
[15:34] that lying down it it just means repose.
[15:36] It's rest. So it's beautiful to says
[15:38] that he knows your rest. He's
[15:40] acquainted. He knows when you go out and
[15:41] sit and rest with them and and and
[15:44] stay still with him and are acquainted
[15:46] with all of my ways. Just think it's
[15:48] beautiful that he he cares for for the
[15:51] rest. So let's talk a little bit about
[15:52] the Lord's rest. He himself rests as
[15:55] well and and he talks about his own rest
[15:57] and how he rests. So we know in Genesis
[16:00] and God blessed the seventh day and
[16:02] sanctified it because that in in it he
[16:06] had rested. He's the first one that you
[16:08] know is stood rest from all his works
[16:11] which God created and made in Isaiah 11
[16:14] and10. And in that day there shall be a
[16:17] root of Jesse which shall stand for an
[16:19] end sign of the people to it shall the
[16:23] Gentiles seek. Is it beautiful that
[16:25] we're prophesied even in the Old
[16:27] Testament that the Gentiles? It's
[16:28] interesting sometimes the the Jews,
[16:30] right? Uh there there's even uh we're
[16:33] promised in their own Bible to to be
[16:36] manifested. It says to it shall the
[16:39] Gentiles seek and his rest shall be
[16:41] glorious. Says a glorious rest even for
[16:44] the Gentiles. It's promised here. We
[16:46] know for the church for Zion. And it
[16:50] says Matthew 8:20. And Jesus said unto
[16:52] him, "The foxes have holes and the birds
[16:56] of the air have nests, but the son of
[16:59] man hath not where to lay his head." So
[17:03] interesting, right? There was a rest in
[17:05] the natural and the ark in the covenant
[17:07] and a place for him to dwell in for his
[17:08] presence to dwell in. And of course, we
[17:10] know that in the spiritual, right, he
[17:12] wants to dwell in a certain place. So we
[17:14] we talk about his rest in in there. And
[17:17] it says in Acts 7:49, "Heaven is my
[17:20] throne and earth is my foottool. So what
[17:24] house will ye build me, sayeth the Lord,
[17:27] or what is the place of my rest?"
[17:31] Right?
[17:33] Challenging there. uh and look at this
[17:35] Psalm 132. For I think he answers it,
[17:39] for the Lord has chosen Zion.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; He had desired it for his habitation.
[17:46] This is my rest forever.
[17:50] Very Bible good Bible answer here. Here
[17:53] in Zion forever he wants to rest there.
[17:56] I will dwell
[17:58] and usually where you dwell is where you
[18:00] rest for I have desired it.
[18:05] I will abundantly bless her provision. I
[18:08] will satisfy her poor with bread with
[18:11] God's own word. Right? And I just want
[18:14] to highlight that verse again. It's the
[18:15] middle of the two I I read. This is my
[18:18] rest forever. Here I will dwell
[18:21] for I have desired it. Talking about
[18:23] sign. So that is his resting place.
[18:25] Psalm 1328 it says arise, O Lord, into
[18:28] thy rest. Look at that. This is
[18:30] beautiful. It's like the psalmist or
[18:33] it's a song or a poem or something being
[18:35] out. It says, "Arise, O Lord, into thy
[18:37] rest." So it's actually commanding the
[18:40] Lord to rest. It says, "Thou the ark of
[18:44] thy strength." Isn't that beautiful?
[18:48] This is actually somebody else speaking
[18:49] these words on behalf of the Lord. It
[18:51] says, "Go ahead and rest, Lord. You and
[18:54] the ark of thy strength."
[18:58] And then we have here where um where it
[19:00] says, I want to just quickly read this
[19:02] because I thought of I found something
[19:03] really interesting um about Solomon. So
[19:08] we know David and then Solomon ended up
[19:10] building the his temple. Behold, a son
[19:12] shall be born to thee. He's talking to
[19:14] David. Who shall be a man of rest. I
[19:18] actually learned that Solomon is shalam
[19:20] or shalom. It comes from the word rest.
[19:22] Shalom. And it says, "And I will give
[19:24] him rest from all his enemies
[19:26] roundabout. For his name shall be
[19:28] Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet
[19:31] unto Israel in his own days." So the
[19:33] very own name Solomon is being described
[19:35] here. He shall build an house for my
[19:38] name, and he shall be my son, and I will
[19:42] be his father, and I will establish the
[19:44] throne for his kingdom over Israel
[19:47] forever. Now, my son, the Lord be with
[19:50] thee, and prosper thou, and build the
[19:53] house of the Lord thy God, and he as as
[19:55] he hath said of thee. Just beautiful to
[19:59] know that, you know, there's a house
[20:00] being built today and there's a son and
[20:02] that there's a man of rest and that we
[20:05] know there's a greater than Solomon
[20:06] here,
[20:07] &gt;&gt; man. Luke 76 6:7 says, "And the scribes
[20:10] and the Pharisees watched
[20:13] whether watched him whether he would
[20:15] heal on the Sabbath day that they might
[20:18] find an accusation against him." And I
[20:20] put these two scripture together here
[20:21] because I just want to say I'm thankful
[20:22] that the Lord will heal me on a
[20:24] Saturday. that will heal me on a Sabbath
[20:27] that will bring us the the healing. And
[20:29] he was not ashamed to be the Lord of the
[20:31] of the Sabbath. And I just think it's
[20:34] beautiful here because
[20:36] it says here in Matthew 12:8, for the
[20:38] son of man is Lord even on the Sabbath
[20:42] day.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Son of man. So rest of the soul. I'm
[20:47] going to wrap up here. Matthew 11:29.
[20:50] Take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[20:52] for I am meek and lonely in lady in
[20:55] heart
[20:57] and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
[21:00] Amen.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; It's not just the rest but it's the soul
[21:03] rest.
[21:04] In Psalm 62,
[21:08] favorite of mine, it says, "My soul
[21:10] wait," and that word wait, it actually
[21:12] means rest as well. It says, "My soul
[21:16] wait
[21:18] thou only upon God for my expectation is
[21:22] from him. He only is my rock and my
[21:26] salvation. He is my defense. I shall not
[21:28] be moved."
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll speak just briefly about
[21:32] Jubilee because um there's also a rest
[21:35] um that it was promised and it says in
[21:37] Leviticus 25:10, "And ye shall hollow
[21:41] the 50th year and proclaim liberty
[21:44] throughout all the land into the
[21:46] inhabitants thereof. It shall be a
[21:48] jubilee unto you, and you shall return
[21:51] every man unto his possession." You to
[21:53] return to your land. You should return
[21:55] every man to his own family, unto his
[21:58] family. And I think that's where we rest
[22:00] is because the Lord's calling us home.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; He's calling us into his jubilee. I
[22:04] think the believer entered into to me it
[22:07] was real special that the first service
[22:08] I came here was literally on the
[22:10] celebration of the 50th appearance of
[22:11] the cloud. To me I heard this message as
[22:14] a here's your jubilee. Here's your shout
[22:19] and the mark of the beast. We know
[22:21] brother Benham here in the message it
[22:23] says and it says here now get back to
[22:26] our type. Now there was a beautiful type
[22:29] given and I wish to start with today the
[22:31] marking of the beast. Uh it says now in
[22:33] the old testament the bible said that
[22:36] there was to be a 50th jubilee that was
[22:39] seven times seven years and in the 40th
[22:42] night year that it was to be made ready
[22:45] and the 50th year was the jubilee year.
[22:47] 50th means jubilee. It was 50 is God's
[22:51] jubilee number. The word pentecost means
[22:54] 50. It was the outpouring of the Holy
[22:56] Spirit and the end of the 50th day. I
[23:01] was also it was also at the end of the
[23:04] 50th year. Amen. Just typifying there
[23:06] what it's going to be. Isaiah 61. The
[23:08] spirit of the Lord God is upon me. And
[23:10] here's the same thing to proclaim
[23:12] liberty to proclaim the acceptable year
[23:14] of the Lord. So when the Lord comes by
[23:16] your way, he's giving you that jubilee.
[23:18] And the believers rest in it says here
[23:21] in this hour it is precept upon my
[23:23] precept line upon line here a little
[23:24] there a little hold fast to that which
[23:26] is good for with the stammering lips and
[23:28] other tongues will I speak to this
[23:30] people and this is the refreshing. Amen.
[23:34] This is the rest that shall come from
[23:36] the presence of the Lord. Remember he
[23:38] told Moses go my presence will be with
[23:40] you and I will give you rest. And then
[23:42] in here we have um speaking about rest
[23:45] and how it says at the bottom. Oh, what
[23:47] is he? The one that comes in you gives
[23:50] you peace, your sign, your comforter at
[23:52] your in your rest. And here I love
[23:54] because it says
[23:56] the bottom it says when we enter into
[23:58] God we rest all the time. Not from
[24:02] Sunday, not from one Sunday to another.
[24:04] We rest eternal. We got eternal life.
[24:07] The Holy Spirit gives you rest. Amen.
[24:10] And here's talking about stones. On the
[24:12] top it talks about stones that were
[24:13] offense and of laughing and of stumbling
[24:16] and of uh but here we talk about it says
[24:19] but for the church a precious load stone
[24:22] to the believer a stone of assurance a
[24:24] stone of rest oh mine resting I know
[24:27] that I have passed from death unto life
[24:29] my soul is at rest. Oh come unto me all
[24:32] that labor and heavy laden and I will
[24:35] give you rest. See, it was a sign to be
[24:37] evil spoken of talking about how prophet
[24:39] uh spoke to uh Mary Simeon. He spoke to
[24:42] Mary and saying that the same stone was
[24:44] going to be what it spoke about before
[24:47] Christ the stumbling stone to the world
[24:49] and it was going to be uh speaking
[24:51] against but to us he's a stone of rest.
[24:54] And then here it says but it will be an
[24:56] assurance. It will be a love it will be
[24:57] a satisfaction and it will be something
[25:00] that you know you pass from death unto
[25:03] life. This is that scripture of Simeon.
[25:05] And it says 5:24. Verily, verily, I say
[25:07] unto you, he that heareth my word and
[25:11] believeth on him that sent me hath
[25:13] everlasting life, and shall not come
[25:16] unto condemnation, but is
[25:20] is passed from death unto life. Amen.
[25:22] Rest in Jesus.
[25:24] Rest from all works. Amen. God bless
[25:26] you, brothers. [applause]
