[15:00] good day so far
[15:02] hey I hid this thing in here today we're
[15:04] gonna get it from the back good look
[15:08] hahaha now I gotta figure out put
[15:12] together no I don't need no help I'm a
[15:24] man I don't need an airplane
[15:26] I don't even need a instruction manual
[15:28] well they put them pieces of paper in
[15:30] there for us we were putting something
[15:33] together yesterday at the bee school and
[15:34] I looked over to the guy and he had
[15:36] rattling a piece of paper I said it was
[15:38] the instruction I said what is that
[15:41] strokes the manual yeah I got all this
[15:44] up here now how about that see Jim
[15:49] didn't like for me disappearing back
[15:50] there in the
[15:51] in the back so anyway got it up here
[15:54] today and one fell swoop so good to be
[15:59] in house of Lord you got your Bibles
[16:01] let's turn to Book of Revelations and
[16:02] get started I promise you we will not be
[16:05] two hours today hour 45 but 2 now the
[16:12] last Sunday didn't seem like 2 hours did
[16:14] it if you really I really enjoyed it
[16:17] myself sometimes you know you sometimes
[16:19] we're just human we don't enjoy
[16:20] preaching dad I heard one yep
[16:24] yeah sometimes you don't enjoy both they
[16:27] sometimes that you really enter in and
[16:29] you really enjoy what what you bring so
[16:33] and it's not for us anyway it's for you
[16:35] guys so it's really not I mean it's not
[16:38] for us it's for it's for you
[16:40] so regardless of how we feel I always
[16:44] ask the Lord to give you something
[16:47] whether he ever speaks to me again give
[16:50] you something that you can take and that
[16:53] you can fight with because I can't fight
[16:54] your battles but I can help you I can
[16:58] help you fight your battle but I can't
[17:00] find your battles for you so let's turn
[17:01] to we go we're in part 6 now we're going
[17:04] to look a little bit more of
[17:06] justification because we're going to
[17:08] maybe go over some things that we were
[17:11] talking about last Sunday and maybe add
[17:14] just a little bit to it so they want to
[17:17] bring in one more aspect of
[17:18] justification because listen you can
[17:22] take justification that's my brother and
[17:23] say you can take one ceiling tile the
[17:25] entire Bible together you ought to solve
[17:26] that last Sunday you can tie it to
[17:29] everything you can tie that first seal
[17:32] to everything everything all right so
[17:36] we're going to try to add a little more
[17:37] to it today so we can see what's going
[17:41] on so let's turn revelation 6 verse 1 in
[17:45] tune let's bow our heads to hell me
[17:46] father we thank you today Lord for a
[17:48] another chance we have become in your
[17:50] house worship you in spirit and in truth
[17:53] and stand before the greatest people
[17:56] will ever be on the face of this earth
[17:58] the bride of Jesus Christ we thank you
[18:02] Lord now for the morning that you've
[18:03] give us all the
[18:05] singing and the playing and all the
[18:07] things that we've done to get ready now
[18:09] we pray Lord that you will be the active
[18:11] participant in the service you take over
[18:13] Lord and you do the speaking you'd be
[18:16] the one that does the healing you'd be
[18:18] the one that does the revealing because
[18:20] without you Lord it's just we're just
[18:22] meeting like a lodge but lord we know
[18:24] that the bride of Jesus Christ is not
[18:26] sitting at large the bride of Jesus
[18:28] Christ is sitting in a tabernacle of
[18:31] flesh that we have Lord the greatest
[18:36] message on the face of the earth and now
[18:38] what do we do with it Lord we bring it
[18:41] and we believe it we are going to
[18:46] manifest a body change we're going to
[18:48] manifest a resurrection come what may
[18:53] doesn't matter what these writers do or
[18:55] it doesn't matter what all the Devils in
[18:58] hell is gonna try to do you will have a
[19:01] church you will have a bride that will
[19:04] stand in the end time and say death you
[19:08] are destroyed Lord but it's only by the
[19:11] revealing of your word what you've
[19:13] already said so we pray Lord that you do
[19:15] that today just be with us be with the
[19:17] missionaries on the foreign fields give
[19:18] them fruit for their labor forgive us of
[19:21] our sins Lord in our many mistakes that
[19:22] we make against you the the things that
[19:25] we do that's not pleasing to you father
[19:26] just bless each one give us all strength
[19:28] we ask these things in Jesus name Amen
[19:31] revelation 6 verse 1 says when I saw and
[19:35] I saw when the lamb opened one of the
[19:37] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[19:39] of thunder one of the four beasts say
[19:41] come and see and I saw him behold a
[19:44] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[19:46] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[19:48] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[19:50] and you may be seated in the Lord at his
[19:52] blessing to the reading of the word but
[19:54] today we're going to continue our
[19:56] thought on we're going to back up just a
[19:58] little bit if you want to bring that
[19:59] back up brothers and show every time
[20:02] we're going to show this because it'll
[20:04] it's going to take your take your mind
[20:06] to what we're talking about Redemption
[20:08] Redemption Redemption we are talking
[20:10] about the the thinking the other day I
[20:13] think we're going to call this the super
[20:15] plan of redemption because we're alive
[20:18] I mean the plan of redemption has been
[20:21] since the beginning of time amen
[20:24] but all those people are passed on we're
[20:28] alive we're actually the ones that are
[20:30] taking this plan of salvation and a plan
[20:33] of redemption and we're the ones that's
[20:35] taking it on a step further and we're
[20:36] taking it on a step further we're the
[20:38] alive and remain to the coming of the
[20:40] Lord all right so you and I are going to
[20:43] be the recipient of the greatest event
[20:47] that ever happened on the face of the
[20:49] earth to a group amen it happened to one
[20:52] man Jesus Christ but it's gonna happen
[20:54] to a group of people never has this ever
[21:00] happened never will it happen
[21:02] again to a Gentile dispensation so you
[21:06] and I are here for a purpose
[21:09] you and I are here that's why we come
[21:12] and we listen and we sit and we endure
[21:16] why because we're supposed to overcome I
[21:19] was telling the church the other day of
[21:21] in Minnesota you got to overcome there's
[21:24] an overcoming he then over cometh he
[21:30] that overcometh and then you get over
[21:32] there in Revelations when it's all
[21:34] finished in the cities coming down it
[21:36] says bless he that has overcome all
[21:38] things and man overcome all things so
[21:41] you overcome everything because you know
[21:42] we can overcome one thing here and
[21:44] something else bothers right or you can
[21:48] overcome one thing and that same thing
[21:50] they'll come back if you don't have that
[21:52] thing dead it is gonna come back so we
[21:55] look at these breaking of the seals
[21:56] though is Redemption Redemption is what
[21:58] bringing us to like what we're talkin
[22:00] about the other Sunday Adam was not in
[22:06] justification he was not in
[22:08] sanctification
[22:09] he received an impartation of the bat of
[22:12] the Holy Ghost and made him a son of God
[22:15] amen okay all right so what we're okay
[22:21] with that then but he did not go through
[22:22] justification in sanctification because
[22:25] remember at the time that he was given
[22:28] that he was not a fallen individual
[22:32] men I have to go through justification
[22:35] goes I have past sins I have to go
[22:38] through sanctification because I have to
[22:39] get cleaned up the things that I had
[22:41] done right ma'am
[22:42] I haven't didn't have to do that but in
[22:45] dirt but now what is that going to bring
[22:47] if Adam fell then we've got to get back
[22:52] to the condition that Adam was in
[22:54] restore Eden back to its original
[22:57] condition but it's God to take that's
[23:02] why these seals are so important it's
[23:04] not just like brother Dale said sure we
[23:05] read it in the Bible you can read it
[23:07] where this the Antichrist is to be
[23:09] revealed this wicked one will read it in
[23:11] I think I brought a portion of second
[23:14] Thessalonians for the mystery of Nick we
[23:16] don't let until he'd be taking another
[23:18] way you understand so he adds to be
[23:20] revealed but remember the whole Bible is
[23:25] the plan of redemption and there's only
[23:27] one man one man that is considered in
[23:31] this plan of redemption Jesus Christ
[23:34] only one who can justify only one who
[23:36] can sink to find only one that can bring
[23:38] a fallen people back up so I have to I
[23:43] have to put my faith in that man that
[23:47] he's not going to do it he's already
[23:49] done it
[23:51] okay he's already done so the seals then
[23:54] are Jesus Christ not the Antichrist so
[23:57] then because remember Satan is not
[23:59] considered in Redemption
[24:00] Satan's kids are not even considered in
[24:03] Redemption brother branham said what
[24:04] only the elect are considered in
[24:07] Redemption because remember Redemption
[24:10] is bringing back but now if you're just
[24:13] a sinner out in the world and and you
[24:15] never make any act of confession there's
[24:20] no redemption there sure there is
[24:21] redemption but you haven't accepted it
[24:24] and then that's the same thing over
[24:27] topic is out of court in the court Holy
[24:28] of Holies longer talk about in just a
[24:30] few minutes when you come back out even
[24:32] born again we remember we read those
[24:34] quotes brother Brown said you do things
[24:36] wrong
[24:40] it's why you got to come back out into
[24:43] the outer Court where everything is and
[24:45] go back through that now you don't go
[24:48] back through the same thing again you
[24:50] don't get the Holy Ghost and come back
[24:51] get the Holy Ghost again and come back
[24:53] you know now once you're sealed in you
[24:56] have the Holy Ghost and in other words
[24:58] this is what happened and we'll see if
[25:03] we can draw and for those of you that
[25:09] can't see this is the Ark of the
[25:10] Covenant so this is the outer court
[25:13] enter court in holy of Holy's once you
[25:15] get into this Holy of Holies and you're
[25:16] sealed in with God remember I asked like
[25:19] I said last Sunday you don't stay there
[25:22] because you're in there alone with God
[25:24] and yes that is a Holy Communion between
[25:26] you and God Almighty but how you gonna
[25:28] show that how you're gonna show that
[25:30] you've been redeemed
[25:31] how you gonna overcome you you don't you
[25:34] don't have to overcome when you're in
[25:35] here
[25:36] uh you know they always say they tied a
[25:38] rope to the priest to drag him out if he
[25:41] died if I went in there and that's your
[25:43] kind of glory they'd have to drag me out
[25:46] man
[25:48] I'd be so full of gone I wouldn't want
[25:51] to come back out they'd have to you're
[25:52] not being there doing this I'll be
[25:54] trying to you know pull them in but
[25:56] that's what it is now but didn't what
[25:57] brother Brown said he said when you get
[25:58] the Holy Ghost what do you wanna do you
[25:59] want to give it to others and that's are
[26:02] you so you I know the priest couldn't do
[26:04] that
[26:04] he knew that can you it was death for
[26:06] somebody else to go back in there but
[26:08] now that that's all been done away with
[26:11] you go behind the Holy of Holies you
[26:13] want to pull everybody you know in but
[26:15] you don't want to have a crowd in here
[26:18] you want to come back out and show what
[26:22] God's done for you that's your witness
[26:24] and that's your testimony that's why you
[26:26] said all this that's so simple listen
[26:28] the seals are the simplest thing in the
[26:30] world you just gotta walk through it
[26:34] remember algebra was really hard at one
[26:38] time well to some of you it probably
[26:41] still is hard but to those of us I met
[26:44] Deanna's teacher the other day and it
[26:46] was her math teacher and she said she
[26:48] really understands math you tell her one
[26:50] time and you don't have to tell her
[26:53] again she
[26:54] Bill's on that see that's the way we are
[26:56] with the Word of God that's what I was
[26:57] thinking I see if you really understand
[26:58] what God has already said you build on
[27:01] that and then the simplicity of that
[27:03] just carries you right on through
[27:04] because once you understand algebra you
[27:07] continue on once you understand one plus
[27:09] one is two two plus two is four yeah
[27:10] remember what I told you the other day
[27:12] there's only ten numbers zero through
[27:19] nine it's just a conglomeration or a
[27:22] configuration of all that and such the
[27:24] same thing with alphabet there's only 26
[27:26] letters an alphabet and all the millions
[27:28] of words that we say is out of that 26
[27:29] letters the alphabet so the seals then
[27:32] is not something and don't get me wrong
[27:35] it's not something that we need to set
[27:38] aside and say oh that's only for a that
[27:44] let me put this right that's only for a
[27:46] scholarly group of people that's only
[27:49] for the the the college-educated people
[27:54] no Peter was Peter was working through
[27:59] all this no not here he was working
[28:02] through all this and couldn't even sign
[28:03] his name so there's hope for all of us
[28:09] somebody in sign your name and it still
[28:11] doesn't look like anything but out of
[28:15] court into court and Holy of Holies
[28:16] everybody got that you just stay right
[28:19] with the simplicity of the message and
[28:20] you walk right through these things and
[28:22] it's not something that you're gonna
[28:23] have - yes it requires study yes it
[28:27] requires that you have to know what the
[28:28] message is but most of us have been in
[28:31] this message you know 20 30 even ten
[28:34] even five years we should be
[28:37] understanding that there's a baby form
[28:40] of justification it's like brother Dale
[28:42] said it you need to know you went
[28:44] through these and you need to know and
[28:46] be able to tell somebody how you went
[28:50] through these did you just one day show
[28:54] up in a message church and then said
[28:56] this sounds good I think up there well
[28:59] the devil beat you here before you got
[29:01] here
[29:02] he said that sounds good I think I can
[29:04] pervert that you know what he said at 29
[29:09] that's the soonest the Holy Ghost fell
[29:11] on the day of Pentecost say you said I
[29:13] think I can imitate that I think I can
[29:16] pervert that you know what I'm gonna do
[29:17] I'm gonna make them believe a lot did me
[29:21] what he done anyway done that's why
[29:24] today once we get through this we're
[29:26] going to talk a little bit about one God
[29:28] in that first seal because to me that's
[29:30] the basic foundation of all of our
[29:33] doctrine is that one true and living God
[29:36] and Jesus Christ is his name he has a
[29:40] name amen because most Trinitarians and
[29:44] most people either either our oneness or
[29:46] Trinity and let me add most people in
[29:50] the message believe in to two Lords two
[29:58] lords Jesus one God to the River Jordan
[30:01] so it was something over here anyone is
[30:03] though most people in the message or
[30:05] Tunis so you got oneness and Tunis and
[30:07] rhiness somewhere in there that's true
[30:10] oneness which is what I believe that the
[30:13] seals opened up when they opened up to
[30:14] the prophet and he saw that something
[30:17] happened and there was something going
[30:20] away from him something leaving yeah you
[30:23] say a prophet yeah I leaving the Prophet
[30:26] it was leaving him not in this soul do
[30:29] you understand what I'm saying
[30:30] so I said once you're born again once
[30:31] you're sealed in here you can't take
[30:35] that holy of holies out of you so we're
[30:37] safe in that aspect the man we're safe
[30:40] in that part of Redemption but rather
[30:43] quote here I'm going to read it out they
[30:45] don't have it but I was looking up just
[30:46] looking up justification where
[30:49] justification is absolutely a walk it's
[30:55] not just well I'm justified no it's a
[30:59] continuation sanctification is a
[31:01] continuation the baptism the Holy Ghost
[31:03] is what being born again I die daily mmm
[31:08] but you got to start here with this
[31:10] let's pull this back up and and read it
[31:13] again so so you've got to understand one
[31:15] thing
[31:16] like brother Dale said you put this in
[31:17] your hat this is this is we're not
[31:20] talking about your soul when we're
[31:23] talking about justification in the seal
[31:27] because it was justification
[31:29] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[31:31] that got you into the body you can get
[31:34] into the body of Christ without
[31:36] understanding the seven seals right but
[31:40] you can't take a body change without
[31:43] understanding that part of the seal that
[31:45] all right so you say well why are you
[31:47] wasting your time where this born-again
[31:49] world somebody's got to come to a body
[31:51] change somebody's got to realize that
[31:54] they really didn't do it that's what we
[31:58] were talking about last Sunday to a
[32:00] degree and then a little more this
[32:02] Sunday but the breaking of the sails
[32:03] then it's not necessarily for the Soul
[32:05] I said not necessarily it feeds your
[32:09] soul because once you get in that holy
[32:11] of holies you want all the word you can
[32:13] get or you can stop like Ron will still
[32:20] about this morning the Holy Ghost is a
[32:21] gentleman you can go just as far as you
[32:24] want to go and you can stop all right
[32:26] but the breaking of the steel is not
[32:28] necessarily for the soul the soul is
[32:30] redeemed by the new birth shed blood of
[32:33] Jesus constant Calvary but why wouldn't
[32:35] you want more once you've got that once
[32:36] you get in that hole if I'm I mean I'm
[32:40] trying not to be sacrilegious but I if I
[32:42] was that priest I wouldn't want to come
[32:44] back out
[32:44] I'd be like brother branham going across
[32:46] the curtain of time why am I gonna go
[32:48] back out there I mean you got the
[32:51] Shekinah glory God is standing there in
[32:53] front of you in a cloud in a pillar and
[32:55] he's accepting listen to me he's
[32:57] accepting that sacrifice that I'm taking
[33:00] the man he's accept and I'm therefore
[33:03] what all of Israel I'm there for the
[33:07] whole nation of Israel one man walking
[33:10] in that holy of holies man I wouldn't
[33:12] want to get out of that thing for
[33:13] nothing cuz remember when he come out
[33:15] this your kind of glory didn't follow
[33:17] him he stayed in the holy holy amen
[33:22] but now you see by the blood of Jesus
[33:27] Christ that veil was rent
[33:30] remember the temple veil was rent from
[33:33] top to bottom so that they could see the
[33:37] holy of holies and now in the day of
[33:40] Pentecost all that to take talk about
[33:42] because remember the Holy of Holies
[33:45] consists of the Word of God the law of
[33:49] Moses remember was the few tablets it
[33:51] was inside that inside that Holy of
[33:54] Holies the two tablets were inside this
[33:56] Ark amen so the word it was the word
[34:00] that was there it was a word that
[34:02] brought its own with the words only
[34:04] going bring Redemption nothing else can
[34:06] bring Redemption and if Jesus Christ is
[34:08] the word of God excuse me the word made
[34:12] flesh you and I now are the word made
[34:15] flesh so we're not behind the holy of
[34:17] holies we're out here and we're telling
[34:19] people about the holy of holies I'm sure
[34:22] that priest tried his best to tell
[34:24] people about it had no clue but now
[34:27] since all of us that are born again it
[34:29] went behind there we can commune in one
[34:32] thing we've been to the Holy of Holies
[34:36] we've been before the Holy of Holies and
[34:39] now that Holy of Holies has disappeared
[34:42] inside of a group of people that Holy of
[34:45] Holies is not something that's a
[34:47] physical place you got to go to it's the
[34:51] Word of God and then you feed off of
[34:54] that but look but it will bring full
[34:57] fellowship in the manifestation that's
[34:59] what's been lost
[35:00] Adams fellowship with God is what
[35:02] separated him the curtain came down in
[35:05] the Garden of Eden so God said Adam I
[35:08] can't talk to you like I used to but I'm
[35:13] going to make a way because I'm going to
[35:15] put enmity see that was to me genesis
[35:17] 3:15 is one of the second greatest
[35:19] scriptures in the Bible Genesis 1:26 is
[35:21] my favorite but 3:15 and there tells how
[35:24] he's going to do it and there is a way
[35:27] back that he did not destroy Adam and
[35:30] Eve after they did what they did but the
[35:35] earth fell man fell in flesh the near
[35:38] fell now everything's got to come back
[35:39] through you and I so there had to be a
[35:41] message though
[35:43] to bring that how are we gonna get
[35:44] somewhere if we don't have a way back a
[35:47] roadmap a way to get there cuz man had
[35:51] probed at it Wesley Luther all the the
[35:54] denominations had had said well it's
[35:56] this way
[35:57] well it's this way well I brought down
[36:00] said and he and that's the truth think
[36:02] about it they're not preaching non
[36:04] salvation in these churches
[36:06] everybody has their the Methodist has a
[36:09] way for you to come to God it's wrong
[36:12] but they have a way for you to try to
[36:14] get to God the only thing they know the
[36:17] Methodists the Baptist the Catholics
[36:21] everybody has their billboard this is
[36:26] how you get saved by the Catholic Church
[36:28] this is how you get oh did you see the
[36:30] other day on the news the Pope told the
[36:35] world he said the United States and
[36:39] Russia must be governed by world
[36:42] government because we're getting out of
[36:44] control
[36:47] now when the Pope says that it's going
[36:51] to happen
[36:52] he says the United States and Russia
[36:54] even said China they're misbehaving so
[36:57] they must be governed by one-world
[37:00] government
[37:01] you ever heard that word one-world
[37:03] government I told him downstairs
[37:07] although that the Pope the now watch
[37:10] Steve we know by the message of the hour
[37:13] and by the Bible who is the image to the
[37:16] Beast which is the United States so
[37:19] what's he saying he said the United
[37:21] States needs to be governed in other
[37:24] words so I can go over there and get
[37:28] them to do what I can't do is one man I
[37:31] can do as a nation it's had enough
[37:34] people but remember when it all happens
[37:38] we're out of here hey man we don't get
[37:40] that we don't get none of that covenant
[37:41] stuff no and then the Pope is gonna go
[37:44] to Israel you know why he's gonna tell
[37:45] them same thing he said y'all need to be
[37:47] governed look at all this out the world
[37:50] is being governed by one-world
[37:52] government we need to include you and
[37:55] you know what they're gonna sign a
[37:56] treaty for
[37:57] seven years to see if it works there's
[38:00] gonna be 144,000 that's gonna protest
[38:04] that but you and I are gonna be in glory
[38:07] enjoying the glory of the Lord but we
[38:10] got to get through this first all right
[38:12] so let's go to court number one and just
[38:15] read a few quotes then we'll get right
[38:18] back on to I thought we will move all
[38:21] the way over into one guard but I think
[38:22] I'm gonna go back to this justification
[38:24] one more time but look revelation
[38:26] chapter five
[38:28] further Brown says see what it's doing
[38:30] this the seals opening up just begin to
[38:32] reveal the plan of redemption
[38:33] I don't need re anymore I've read that
[38:35] quote six times the plan of redemption
[38:38] so thank the plan of redemption when we
[38:40] start talking we don't like the plan of
[38:41] redemption whatever we're talking about
[38:43] we're talking about this these seals are
[38:46] beginning to reveal the plan of
[38:48] redemption all right that bow okay with
[38:51] that so then you started out we did with
[38:54] the mystery of iniquity let's go to
[38:56] second Thessalonians 2 verse 7 for the
[38:59] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[39:00] now remember according to what we were
[39:02] talking about a couple weeks ago that
[39:04] mystery is now history that mystery
[39:07] there is no mystery where Satan is there
[39:11] shouldn't be any mystery and I'm not
[39:14] talking about just history in our in our
[39:17] thinking and our ideas we know what the
[39:19] seed of Satan is what he's trying to do
[39:22] we know that so there's no mystery
[39:25] anymore that's been made known prophet
[39:27] of God said the mystery has been made
[39:29] what history all right so let's put that
[39:31] out of the way we don't listen the only
[39:35] thing that's going to deceive us is
[39:38] what's coming in this message the
[39:42] perversion of this message because
[39:45] everything out hey Diana
[39:47] my baby girls here but everything else
[39:50] that that's there's not a deception the
[39:53] deception is here how was the baddest
[39:57] going to Seaview house the Methodists
[40:03] going to deceive you but somebody's
[40:06] jumped in the message it may deceive you
[40:08] it may deceive the very
[40:11] if it were possible so the mystery of
[40:17] iniquity we gotta start shaving this off
[40:19] we know where the seed of Satan is we
[40:20] know what Satan's doing he's perverting
[40:24] everything God he is not an original
[40:26] he's perverting everything he's a wild
[40:28] horse rider he looks like sometimes he
[40:31] acts like God amen for the mystery of
[40:36] iniquity doth already work now that's
[40:38] Paul probably about twenty years after
[40:43] the Holy Ghost filming today at
[40:44] Pentecost he's writing to the
[40:46] Thessalonians 20 years after the pure
[40:49] Word of God hit the earth Paul is saying
[40:53] the mystery of iniquity doth already
[40:55] work he talks about Grievous wolves John
[40:59] says Antichrist goes remember he saw him
[41:01] over there on the Isle of Patmos and
[41:03] admired him remember he admired that
[41:05] thing to let angel shook him and said
[41:08] hey I'll be looking at that thing for
[41:12] the mystery of iniquity doth already
[41:13] work only he God who now letteth will
[41:16] let until he'd the bride and I'm
[41:19] quilting brother branham be taken out of
[41:21] the way so he let he's gonna let this
[41:24] thing go on and you and I are gonna be
[41:26] taken out of the way so that this man of
[41:28] sin can what fully manifest yourself the
[41:33] Pope can't fully manifest what he's
[41:35] going to do with us here oh it's working
[41:40] I remember the Catholic Church they have
[41:43] like a thirty year program so they're
[41:46] already into the 2040s 50s almost into
[41:51] the 2050s with their program that
[41:53] they've got I hope it don't make it to
[41:55] let people know maybe some babies will
[41:58] be around but we won't but the mystery
[42:02] of iniquity just already worked only he
[42:06] who now letteth will let until he be
[42:07] taken away because you know what happens
[42:13] like the Baptist let's just take the
[42:15] Baptist for example because we know
[42:16] their doctrine once saved always say
[42:18] well once inside the holy Holies I agree
[42:22] once inside the whole once that whole
[42:24] Holy's is inside of you you're sealed
[42:26] until the day of your Redemption all
[42:28] right but now if you just walk up to
[42:30] this court and you just start feeling
[42:32] good right about here then you start
[42:34] feeling a little bit better in this
[42:37] second court because because you know
[42:39] the the waters of separation and you
[42:41] come in here you got the candlesticks
[42:43] and you get to feeling a little bit
[42:44] better but you're never going to holy of
[42:45] Holy's you're not saved a man well then
[42:50] see that's a mystery that has been
[42:52] that's my brother Branham when he gets
[42:54] into these seals he says now I see why I
[42:56] hated that thing why he hated that
[42:58] organization because Satan was riding
[43:00] right in that organization telling the
[43:03] people there okay what do you do you
[43:10] believe what they say you believe what's
[43:14] going on and that's what Satan wants you
[43:17] do because he's gonna give you so much
[43:18] lying lying wonders and all true you're
[43:21] gonna believe that God said you believe
[43:23] a lot and be damned by it alright now
[43:28] let's go to Titus 2:14 but remember the
[43:30] mystery of iniquity it's not something
[43:32] that we're you know we're out we're left
[43:34] out we can't get in here we're barred oh
[43:36] no we can't get in here who Christ gave
[43:42] himself for us that he might redeem us
[43:44] from all iniquity and purify unto
[43:48] himself a peculiar people zealous of
[43:51] good works proverbs 16:6 how by mercy
[43:55] and truth why mercy by the Holy Ghost
[43:58] and the truth of the word collect you've
[44:00] got to have both of them combined mercy
[44:03] of God is that God filled you with the
[44:05] Holy Ghost and you still had problems
[44:09] you still had problems but you accepted
[44:14] what he already said by mercy and truth
[44:18] iniquity is purged in other words you
[44:20] have it to purge the line you gotta have
[44:24] water in it you wouldn't need to purge a
[44:26] water line if you didn't have water in
[44:27] it you're purging that water line cuz
[44:30] there's water in there or sewage or
[44:32] whatever you want to say well our case
[44:34] would be sewage by mercy and truth
[44:36] iniquity is purged
[44:38] all right rolling it and by the fear of
[44:41] the Lord men depart from evil show mercy
[44:43] and truth by the Holy Ghost coming and
[44:46] giving you something to fight with and
[44:48] giving you a sword which is the truth of
[44:51] the word iniquitous / so in other words
[44:53] the iniquity is not this big word that
[44:55] we can't we can't handle you know we've
[45:00] come to a place to where we can even
[45:02] handle death now Paul did post the death
[45:06] where is your sting now he was lying if
[45:08] he what didn't say that
[45:09] death where's you staying grave where is
[45:12] your victory we have all things through
[45:16] Christ who strengthens us they are into
[45:19] justification so the mystery of iniquity
[45:20] to me to me the mystery of iniquity has
[45:22] done away with when we see that that God
[45:25] is not three that like brother Dale has
[45:29] been preaching how this all marries
[45:30] together the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[45:31] all come to you at the new birth not
[45:35] just a father sending the son that I
[45:37] just want to say that Trinitarian
[45:39] doctrines from the pit come from the
[45:40] pits of hell and man they did come from
[45:42] God never did never will all right put
[45:48] that back up there justification
[45:53] Strong's justification is what righteous
[45:56] justified and vindicated by God you
[45:59] can't justify yourself you can't pull
[46:02] you you can't pull yourself up by your
[46:03] own bootstraps
[46:04] that's a prophet said one time look and
[46:06] vindicated by God God will vindicate
[46:09] every situation that you have he'll
[46:12] vindicate him being there if not then
[46:15] you're not born again because remember
[46:18] he's only obligated to keep his children
[46:21] not somebody else's alright it's a part
[46:26] of God's attribute because God's
[46:28] attribute is what a redeemer and to be
[46:31] redeemed you must go through
[46:33] justification amen and then
[46:37] justification means of God as covenant
[46:40] keeping in Redemption
[46:41] God said he's going to do it and then of
[46:45] people enjoying salvation I enjoy
[46:48] justification my past sins are gone
[46:51] listen I I'm telling you when when
[46:53] brother branham told me he'd tell you
[46:56] when brother mom told me I don't have to
[46:58] go through the tribulation or I don't
[47:01] have to stand before the white throne
[47:03] judgment
[47:03] I am so justified I didn't do it or they
[47:07] would be a mark because the people that
[47:09] are standing at white throne judgment
[47:11] they have a mark they have to be judged
[47:15] by their own words that's why the the
[47:20] height of salvation the heights of
[47:23] justification is in these seals the
[47:25] height of redemption amen that Alright
[47:32] isaiah 53:11 he shall see the travail of
[47:36] his soul and shall be satisfied by his
[47:39] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[47:42] justify many now he didn't say justify
[47:45] all justified meaning only his children
[47:51] man for he shall bear their iniquities
[47:54] so we know who you know listen we know
[47:57] who we know who this mystery of iniquity
[47:59] is but we know the guy that banished it
[48:02] he's my father he's my husband hey man
[48:06] he bore my iniquity he took my iniquity
[48:11] and put him in the sea of God's
[48:12] forgiveness
[48:13] acts 13 38 be it known unto you
[48:16] therefore men and brethren that through
[48:17] this man it's preached unto you the
[48:19] forgiveness of sins who Jesus Christ and
[48:21] by him all that believe are justified
[48:26] from all things from which you could not
[48:30] be justified by the law of Moses that's
[48:33] why this holy of holies had two law of
[48:35] Moses one man went in one man come out
[48:38] but the sin was still there but when
[48:44] Jesus Christ became the holy holy the
[48:49] part that come to come in you all this
[48:51] others you don't have to worry about
[48:52] so I said once you get in then that Holy
[48:55] of Holies like we're in the Holy of
[48:56] Holies the Bible says come boldly before
[48:58] the throne well that's where the throne
[49:00] was and then come boldly to the throne
[49:03] because you
[49:04] can be justified by that law that was in
[49:07] note that was in that arc that's why
[49:10] when Israel finds all this and starts
[49:13] putting this temple back together
[49:15] there's 144,000 group that's going to
[49:17] say he's not in there he's in here and
[49:24] they Israel is gonna kill them 144,000
[49:28] you know I mean you guys stay single
[49:31] care well I mean you know even the
[49:34] people in the Middle East think okay
[49:35] listen Syria wants them all dead anyway
[49:38] Jordan wants them all dead anyway Iran
[49:40] and Iraq they want the Jews dead anyway
[49:45] with them Israelites they're gonna say
[49:48] we got this all together our messiahs
[49:50] coming then you go have 144,000 standing
[49:53] around it going he's already here and
[49:56] you missed it because remember they're
[50:00] gonna get a revelation that that man
[50:03] that they crucified was the Holy of
[50:05] Holies
[50:06] they man all right Romans 1 verse 16 not
[50:09] gonna get finished for this phone get
[50:10] off the rabbit trail for I'm not ashamed
[50:12] of the gospel of Christ whereas the
[50:14] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[50:16] that what believeth to the Jew first and
[50:19] also to the great for therein is the
[50:21] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[50:24] to faith at it is written as it is
[50:26] written the just shall live by faith you
[50:28] know Martin Luther's just shall live by
[50:30] faith didn't die it's still true today
[50:35] [Music]
[50:37] how do I live by faith if I'm not just
[50:40] if I don't know that somebody's made me
[50:42] just I couldn't live you couldn't come
[50:46] to church and understand God the just
[50:49] still has to live by faith because
[50:55] remember it says the just shall live by
[51:00] faith you got to be just first so Martin
[51:05] Luther in his what we call it even
[51:08] brother Branham I got the quote right
[51:09] here brother Graham called it in his
[51:10] weakness his weak doctrine Martin
[51:13] Luther's doctrine according to our
[51:15] doctor in this week but he put him in
[51:18] the body
[51:18] it put him in the body why was it wheat
[51:22] because it only put the people he's in
[51:24] his group and only put there just got
[51:26] them in a man because remember he could
[51:29] smoke and and drink and you know I don't
[51:33] think he was an evil man when we say
[51:35] that was the you think well he was in a
[51:36] pub where they played rock'n'roll music
[51:38] and you know no no he was a German
[51:41] Germans drink beer they drink beer light
[51:43] reads we bring water but he talked about
[51:46] guarding God justified Martin Luther by
[51:49] the faith that Martin Luther had and
[51:51] what God said amen so the just he was
[51:55] just first then he lived by faith then
[51:58] all right all right Louis that good you
[52:02] okay bless his heart didn't I know he
[52:05] gets you weak when you when you've been
[52:06] sick all week
[52:07] Romans 3:19 says now we know what things
[52:12] soever the law says it says to them who
[52:14] are under the law that every mouth may
[52:16] be stopped and all the world may become
[52:18] guilty before God therefore by the deeds
[52:20] of the law there shall no flesh be
[52:23] justified in the sight for for by the
[52:26] law is the knowledge of sin that was
[52:29] here first first time tackle alright but
[52:37] now the righteousness of God without the
[52:39] law is manifested being witnessed by the
[52:42] law and the prophets even the
[52:43] righteousness of God which is by faith
[52:45] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[52:48] them that believe for there is no
[52:51] difference but we've all sinned and come
[52:53] short of the glory of God being
[52:56] justified freely by His grace through
[53:00] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[53:02] now this is why I told you last Sunday
[53:05] will probably be brother branham cuz
[53:07] remember brother Brown comes out and he
[53:08] says okay justification it's like
[53:10] picking up the glass I picked up the mug
[53:13] out of the dirt it's still dirty it's
[53:15] still gommi it's got stuff all over it
[53:18] but it's the glass
[53:20] he was just in picking it up he
[53:24] justified that glass though it still be
[53:27] dirty he was going to use that glass he
[53:29] had a purpose for that glass
[53:32] all right whom God has set forth to be a
[53:36] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[53:37] to declare his righteousness for the
[53:40] remission of sins that are past cuts off
[53:44] your past sins picks you up out of the
[53:47] mud forgives you of the mud that you
[53:51] were in amen doesn't think the mud off
[53:54] though no we thought this is baby form
[53:57] justification to declare I say but now
[54:00] we remember we got to bring it up like
[54:01] we did last Sunday to declare I say at
[54:03] this time his righteousness that he
[54:05] might be just and the justifier of womb
[54:09] of him who bewitched believeth in Jesus
[54:12] that's me and you all right what is the
[54:14] boasting then is it excluded by law of
[54:17] works nay but by the law of faith
[54:19] therefore we conclude this is the whole
[54:22] conclusion of the whole thing we
[54:24] conclude that a man is justified by
[54:26] faith without the deeds of the law all
[54:29] right going down a little bit further
[54:30] seeing it is one God they brings him one
[54:33] God which shall justify the circumcision
[54:35] by faith and the uncircumcision through
[54:38] faith all right we were talking about
[54:40] that last Sunday all right now remember
[54:42] Romans 8:29 for whom he did foreknow he
[54:45] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[54:47] the image of his son that he might be
[54:49] the firstborn among many brethren
[54:52] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[54:54] he also called and whom he called he
[54:57] also justified and whom he justified
[54:58] them he also glorified all right so it's
[55:03] all done by him but remember those who
[55:06] is justified he's already glorified
[55:08] alright so you and I must see that and
[55:13] that we must realize that our baby form
[55:18] justification begins the process but
[55:22] it's not the end of the process it won't
[55:26] like said it won't even what Martin
[55:28] Luther preached in and set the world on
[55:30] fire won't even get you in the body of
[55:33] Christ because what the progression of
[55:36] God's Word the revelation that has been
[55:40] brought through Luther Wesley Pentecost
[55:42] and then into this message that it's
[55:44] brought us
[55:45] to where now it's not just that we are
[55:48] justified it's we if we're justified
[55:51] we're already glorified if we're truly
[55:53] justified and you know what God's one
[55:58] only one that knows that but I'll
[55:59] promise you he'll tell you somewhere
[56:01] because you got to know your position
[56:04] and to know your position you God has to
[56:08] tell you that brother Dale can't tell
[56:10] you your position brother dig myself we
[56:12] can't tell you your position you have to
[56:14] find it out and you can only get it from
[56:16] God so whom he is justified he's already
[56:21] glorified and I'm not gonna add to the
[56:23] word but I'm gonna say he'll tell you
[56:25] this he'll let you know where you're at
[56:29] remember brother Brown said you should
[56:31] know where you're at with God at any
[56:32] time is that right now who's gonna tell
[56:36] you that devil no God you only ones
[56:42] gonna let you know where you act all
[56:45] right let's go to number two that's our
[56:47] word now seeing that Paul was justifying
[56:51] Abraham by faith
[56:52] James justified anybody's works and he
[56:54] spoke of that up at the top a little bit
[56:55] Paul said Abraham was justified Romans
[56:58] four by faith and so James comes over
[57:00] and says that he was justified by words
[57:02] now both of them one confirmed the other
[57:05] now Paul was speaking what God saw his
[57:09] faith James is speaking what man saw his
[57:12] works they're bad guys that's a man
[57:15] because remember God sees all this but
[57:19] like I said last Sunday when you get in
[57:21] that Holy of Holies you've got to come
[57:23] back out to here to show it
[57:25] that's your works this is your works to
[57:30] god that's not knowledge to know 2+2 4
[57:34] that's knowledge to know about God's
[57:36] Word maybe we don't been through all
[57:38] these that's not man's virtue or man's
[57:42] nice oh god that was the actual
[57:44] attribute of that man standing on earth
[57:46] every way he acted that's how you and I
[57:49] are supposed I Amen virtue has went
[57:53] forth from me
[57:58] temperance patience godliness to love
[58:01] people that don't even love you
[58:03] Christ got on a cross for people who
[58:06] didn't even love him amen that's what
[58:09] you and I got to be so to show our faith
[58:12] and to show our works we got to come
[58:15] back out like we were reading last
[58:16] Sunday we read it again let's pull up
[58:18] number number three why my people so
[58:20] cost about because brother I'm like
[58:22] brother down said brother around looks
[58:23] like he puts you in the Holy of Holies
[58:26] and then he brings you out well he does
[58:29] yeah and I want to emphasize this one
[58:33] more time if you get inside these holy
[58:35] Holies and stay there the whole
[58:39] Christian life is white like brother
[58:40] that's it living for others and how you
[58:44] gonna live for others shut up inside of
[58:46] the box you can't you got to come out oh
[58:53] if that priest could ever got the Holy
[58:56] Ghost in his soul you wouldn't had to
[58:59] had a rope he to pull his head down
[59:02] getting out to tell them finally finally
[59:06] it sit here not just something I gotta
[59:08] put in front of me so Paul is telling us
[59:13] how God is doing this work James is
[59:17] telling us that we got to come out and
[59:19] go and our works has got a show that's
[59:23] what he said before and that's in that
[59:25] scripture before or in that quote before
[59:27] now number three why my people still
[59:28] Pop's talked about I want you to notice
[59:31] another thing about this peculiar of the
[59:33] light the believer walks him when he's
[59:34] in Christ look the walk that the
[59:37] believer walks in when he's in Christ
[59:40] peculiar arity of it now the three
[59:43] course the justified man out here he
[59:46] walks by daylight some days as gloomy
[59:47] days you get it out here remember out
[59:51] here this was open if you're looking
[59:53] your picture out there this is open if
[59:55] it rains you get wet it's hot you got

[1:00:11] holy bring him out here and put him on
[1:00:14] display a man to me that's what the
[1:00:17] statue of a perfect men it man is is a
[1:00:19] display of God Paul Peter comes out and
[1:00:23] said silver and gold have I none but
[1:00:26] such as I got when I was in the Holy of
[1:00:28] Holies I'm going to give it to you
[1:00:30] you get it all I hope you see this god
[1:00:34] bless you some days are glooming some
[1:00:36] days you do not know whether it's really
[1:00:38] worthwhile to serve God or not you never

[1:00:47] eating manna sure you are a believer
[1:00:50] sure you have eternal life sure if you
[1:00:53] die you go to heaven truly but what kind
[1:00:55] of life are you living every day you get
[1:00:57] out oh I got my dandruff up today I told
[1:01:00] him about our custom on I couldn't help
[1:01:02] it God forgive me sure he will certainly
[1:01:07] he will you're his child but what kind
[1:01:10] of life are you living let me interject
[1:01:13] a little between the lines
[1:01:15] what kind of whipping are you fixing to
[1:01:16] give because you're fixing to get a
[1:01:18] whipping a man that the children of the
[1:01:21] world they're not gonna get a whip until
[1:01:23] the white throne judgment you not get
[1:01:24] our whipping now amen what kind of life
[1:01:27] were you living my don't you hate to
[1:01:28] live that kind of life ups and downs
[1:01:30] trouble poor day and night back slidden
[1:01:33] back to church back slidden back to
[1:01:35] church this that apologize to this over
[1:01:38] here this other fellas just bloom and
[1:01:40] run along bone not a thing see you know
[1:01:42] why because he lives he takes this and
[1:01:46] brings it out here sure he's gonna have
[1:01:50] ups and downs but he's living in the
[1:01:52] light all right
[1:01:55] see what kind of a light he walking in
[1:01:57] according to the weather it gives the
[1:02:00] light outside the gloomy the foggy the
[1:02:02] halfway and a brighter day just been
[1:02:05] gloomy for two days outside but as a
[1:02:08] Christian that we supposed to let that
[1:02:09] bother us when I supposed to let that
[1:02:11] hinders were supposed to go out and and
[1:02:13] I love what brother Brett said one time
[1:02:16] you know somebody asked him a question
[1:02:17] he said now cloudy days don't mean that
[1:02:19] God's against you he said sunny days
[1:02:22] don't mean nothing for you either yeah
[1:02:24] no that's just the weather that's just
[1:02:26] what happens out there but I'm nobody in
[1:02:28] here and in here a foggy in a cloud over
[1:02:30] the Sun that's the way any regenerated
[1:02:32] justified man lives so the second form
[1:02:35] of justification that we're talking
[1:02:36] about the unclean I mean the wild horse
[1:02:39] rider leaves listen you're white if
[1:02:44] you're born again you're white
[1:02:47] that ought to settle it if you're born
[1:02:50] again you're white you're Stuart you're
[1:02:51] as white as you'll ever be you never get
[1:02:55] no more white in your soul you never
[1:02:59] will
[1:03:00] there's not little spots you're either
[1:03:04] black or white in that soul right here
[1:03:08] you're either black or white now when
[1:03:11] you come back out here you're gonna have
[1:03:13] some black days he just said that you
[1:03:17] got on some days you feel back slid back
[1:03:19] slid back to church back slid back to
[1:03:21] church but once we know what that man of
[1:03:29] sin is doing it's him that's giving you
[1:03:32] them gloomy day it's him that's giving
[1:03:34] you those foggy days it's him that's
[1:03:37] giving you that backslidden condition
[1:03:39] but look folks brother Branham said a
[1:03:45] child of God can get knocked down but
[1:03:49] the difference in a child of God and a
[1:03:51] child of the devil the child the devil
[1:03:54] stays there a child the God gets back up
[1:03:57] a man picks up the sword he might drop
[1:04:01] the sword he might lost his sword he's
[1:04:03] looking around for it but if you ever
[1:04:04] get that sword pick back up go back in
[1:04:06] the bottle number four
[1:04:18] this is when we read last Sunday now
[1:04:21] that what he had anointed prophets
[1:04:23] sexual born men but it wouldn't work no
[1:04:25] one time then God became man and Jesus
[1:04:28] was that man and he was the expressed
[1:04:30] image of the Father see in other words
[1:04:32] all this great purity of love great
[1:04:34] purity of power all this great thing was
[1:04:36] manifested in him now therefore he went
[1:04:39] down to the grave and died for us for
[1:04:41] our sanctification I love this pull it
[1:04:43] up so they can see that um brother okay
[1:04:47] he went down to the grave and died for
[1:04:49] us now remember the Bible says he rose
[1:04:53] for our justification listen Jesus
[1:04:58] Christ could have rose left and not come
[1:05:02] back he's God he do what he wanted but
[1:05:05] he didn't the reason he rose in human
[1:05:09] flesh was to come back into your human
[1:05:12] flesh look he died for us for our
[1:05:17] sanctification and justification then
[1:05:21] brings back the Holy Spirit see for us
[1:05:23] now therefore we are the justified
[1:05:26] Christ was the sanctification of God we
[1:05:30] are the justification because remember
[1:05:33] we are the ones that have sinned only
[1:05:40] Christians have seen did y'all know you
[1:05:42] let me read that quote but we're
[1:05:45] justified you got to believe that we are
[1:05:49] the justification Christ the
[1:05:52] sanctification and the father's the head
[1:05:54] now there's justification Satan kid's
[1:05:55] baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:05:57] because who comes to you at the Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost the head the head comes Christ the
[1:06:03] man like brother Bob was gone but the
[1:06:05] man comes to you not yet sure you sure
[1:06:08] you start as a baby but guards no baby
[1:06:12] when he comes inside of you you were
[1:06:14] baby because you listen you and I don't
[1:06:18] know how to handle God unless God gets
[1:06:20] inside of you hey man you won't know how
[1:06:24] to handle God you look look what you did
[1:06:27] out in the world please please just
[1:06:29] let you mind wonder for a second it's
[1:06:31] wandering now let it wander for a second
[1:06:35] of the things you did totally contrary
[1:06:39] to God and now the things that you did
[1:06:44] the things I used to do I do them no
[1:06:48] more why he justified you he what he
[1:06:54] clean went down to the Washington part
[1:06:56] yet he justified you you're just that's
[1:07:01] why you're just as righteous as God is
[1:07:04] if you're justified true justification
[1:07:09] amen done alright we went over this last
[1:07:13] Sunday but we just go down again a
[1:07:15] little bit more go down the road a
[1:07:16] little more number five Christ the
[1:07:18] mystery of God revealed I think y'all
[1:07:20] put the number on the next one but
[1:07:21] that's actually number five in the
[1:07:22] continuation of it so leave it right
[1:07:24] there look brother Branham says we stand
[1:07:26] justified in Christ before him because
[1:07:29] he cannot pass judgment for he's already
[1:07:31] judged that body now let's look at the
[1:07:38] onion peel he's talking about the body
[1:07:39] he was in Christ body that he was in but
[1:07:43] now that body doesn't need justification
[1:07:48] but his bride body needs justification a
[1:07:52] man his bride body needs justification
[1:07:55] and sanctification to keep us clean he
[1:07:58] we stand justified in Christ before him
[1:08:01] because he cannot pass judgment he's
[1:08:03] already judged that body in which I am a
[1:08:07] part of what how am i a part of it here
[1:08:11] it is it's in me pretty simple in it if
[1:08:15] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:08:17] you then what you say ask the Father
[1:08:20] anything in my name it'll be done
[1:08:22] because it's there justified glory to
[1:08:25] God alright continuing down oh if I
[1:08:28] could get the world to see that alright
[1:08:34] same thing oh if I could get the world
[1:08:36] to see that why there you are there is
[1:08:39] the body of Christ living standing or
[1:08:42] named redeemed oh my justified in this
[1:08:46] side why are we justified where his
[1:08:49] victory the church is his victory we
[1:08:55] come forth in this last day with this
[1:08:57] glorious gospel showing his victory he
[1:09:00] died for this purpose and we are proof
[1:09:03] of his victory then we see him coming
[1:09:06] living down in the church that's his
[1:09:08] victory his victories me and you amen

[1:10:52] so you say while them fish sealed you
[1:10:55] they just gonna be giving eternal life
[1:10:56] they'd say well yeah they are but so
[1:10:59] were you you were a Gentile you were out
[1:11:03] of the economy of God you were gone but
[1:11:06] God give eternal life to you so don't
[1:11:09] think it's so much that God's gonna give
[1:11:10] you eternal life to a group of people
[1:11:11] that didn't believe in him because he
[1:11:13] gave that he gave it to you you started
[1:11:16] believing that true germ took hold now
[1:11:20] you're not only forgiven but you're
[1:11:22] justified glory justified Romans five
[1:11:25] said yeah therefore being justified by
[1:11:27] faith the whole thing though this whole
[1:11:29] thing's faith amen
[1:11:32] this whole thing is built on faith look
[1:11:37] up the word the word don't mean
[1:11:38] forgiving the word means justified it
[1:11:41] don't mean you're forgiven for instance
[1:11:43] you hear I got drunk and done some evil
[1:11:45] thing and everything then you come
[1:11:46] around say to me you found out I didn't
[1:11:49] do them then you come around and say
[1:11:50] brother am i forgive you forgive me I
[1:11:52] ain't doing it to verse right now if I
[1:11:55] did it I'm guilty we've all sinned and
[1:12:00] come short of the glory of God that's
[1:12:02] what the Bible says right but you could
[1:12:04] forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty
[1:12:07] that's just in that's just in our form
[1:12:10] right but yet I'm not justified because
[1:12:14] I actually done it but the word
[1:12:17] justified is though you never done it
[1:12:20] it's not even regarded at all how is it
[1:12:25] done in God's book of the sea of
[1:12:26] forgetfulness your old book in marriage
[1:12:29] is divorced and dead it's not even in
[1:12:31] the memories of God what sins are you
[1:12:35] talking about we bring them up every day
[1:12:39] God don't remember I'd be a nervous
[1:12:43] wreck if I was God I'd be a nervous
[1:12:47] wreck what you thought about but in that
[1:12:51] the truth we keep rehashing all this
[1:12:54] stuff that God don't even don't even
[1:12:56] remember that's why we got to have faith
[1:13:00] that it's done we got to have not just
[1:13:03] baby for them just to forget
[1:13:05] I believe God chopped my past sins off I
[1:13:07] believe God give me the Holy Ghost I
[1:13:09] believe he's saying to find me but I
[1:13:11] also believe I got problems then I gotta
[1:13:16] work on in my spirit realm to connect
[1:13:19] back to my soul
[1:13:22] remember I said before you were detached
[1:13:25] from that that soul is white if you're
[1:13:30] born again that soul is as wide as it
[1:13:31] ever will be but inside that that second
[1:13:36] rim memory memory reasoning conscious
[1:13:43] affection that's not a godly love that
[1:13:46] feel you look imagination boy that will
[1:13:50] get you but that's where God works and
[1:13:53] the devil works but saying can't work in
[1:13:57] your soul if you're born again that's
[1:13:59] why we gotta realize greater is he have
[1:14:02] you ever heard that before there's a
[1:14:05] song but greater is He that's in you
[1:14:06] than his son okay if there's not
[1:14:09] somebody ought to write one if you laugh
[1:14:14] you might wake up a little bit I'm
[1:14:18] hollered as loud as I can the legs got
[1:14:23] his hearing aid I'm gonna go earplugs in
[1:14:27] I'm still blowing him away right I'm
[1:14:31] sorry man that's why stand over here
[1:14:33] don't say no blood just for you I said
[1:14:34] oh we're mark Mark's ears ring for three
[1:14:36] days but that's all right he hears me
[1:14:39] the old union is in the sea of god's
[1:14:42] forgetfulness you wasn't married to it
[1:14:44] to begin with
[1:14:46] remember we were trapped into this he
[1:14:53] the bridegroom boy your shame himself
[1:14:55] for you in your place he took your place
[1:14:58] for you were predestinated for him to be
[1:15:01] in his bride before the foundation of
[1:15:03] the world the Bible said so you are the
[1:15:05] predestinated seed now continue on
[1:15:08] invisible Union you're standing
[1:15:10] completely you never sinned at the first
[1:15:13] place God don't even know when we gonna
[1:15:15] start believing this
[1:15:17] it's in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:15:20] never did it you were accused of it by
[1:15:22] the accuser but really from the
[1:15:23] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[1:15:25] son and daughter of God you're standing
[1:15:30] there washed your old book of
[1:15:32] divorcement is put away and it's dead
[1:15:35] absolutely out of existence even in the
[1:15:38] mind of God listen if God can bring up
[1:15:41] one thing against you one thing you're
[1:15:45] not born again one thing but when he
[1:15:50] bursts you into the body he washes all
[1:15:52] that out but by the washing in the water
[1:15:56] of the word like the water that came out
[1:15:59] of the pyramid and sister Sheppard's
[1:16:00] dream he had trash in it now sister
[1:16:03] Sheppard soul didn't have trash in it
[1:16:05] her spirit realm had trash in it because
[1:16:09] you can forget the body the body's just
[1:16:11] holding all this together okay my hand
[1:16:13] don't sin my eyes don't sin but what's
[1:16:17] inside me does what's inside me does and
[1:16:22] it comes out but we gotta also remember
[1:16:26] though we were trapped in this thing I
[1:16:28] wasn't supposed to come like this
[1:16:30] what is Redemption bringing back so we
[1:16:35] got to bring it back and we got to let
[1:16:36] God bring about you're the virtuous
[1:16:39] Bride of Christ washed in the blood of
[1:16:40] Christ
[1:16:41] precious virtuous sinless son of God
[1:16:42] where's the negative in this standing
[1:16:45] with a pure unadulterated bride word
[1:16:47] that he washed by the water of his own
[1:16:49] blood that became flesh and manifested
[1:16:52] that he might take you which were
[1:16:53] predestinated in the bosom of the Father
[1:16:56] before the beginning the same as he was
[1:17:00] he was that great attribute of God
[1:17:04] called love amen so what sins are you
[1:17:08] talking about you walk him back through
[1:17:11] here heading back to get another dip not
[1:17:20] to get a not to get a new birth not to
[1:17:24] get a new new birth because you're born
[1:17:26] again amen born again
[1:17:31] right but what we're heading toward is
[1:17:33] this guy right here that's gonna seal
[1:17:40] this thing in seal it in then when this
[1:17:45] comes down guess what we've got to come
[1:17:47] right back out here we hadn't done that
[1:17:48] yet but we don't come right back out
[1:17:49] here and do the same thing always three
[1:17:52] there's three forms of justification
[1:17:55] there's three forms of sanctification
[1:17:56] and there's three forms of the baptism
[1:17:58] of the Holy Ghost are three stages that
[1:18:01] we have to go through is that all right
[1:18:03] because remember we truly get the love
[1:18:06] of God agape love in our soul when we're
[1:18:08] born again we get that love right up
[1:18:11] there but we don't know how to use it we
[1:18:19] do not know how to use it we are
[1:18:21] ignorant and unlearned because we were
[1:18:24] born with a carnal mind on this side but
[1:18:28] once he comes in though he's got to drag
[1:18:30] us up to that spot and you know what
[1:18:33] he's if he and I'm telling you yeah Jim
[1:18:36] saw a thing on Facebook the other day
[1:18:38] you remember the remember the thing it
[1:18:40] says um there was one set of footprints
[1:18:43] said that's when I carried you they said
[1:18:45] there was another sign that had some
[1:18:47] drag marks on it he's asked God says
[1:18:48] what's that he said that's when I drug
[1:18:50] you because listen if you're a child of
[1:18:56] God you gonna get drug I done told you
[1:19:01] I've been I was drugged and when I was a
[1:19:02] little kid I drove from one church to
[1:19:04] the net I judged you church every Sunday
[1:19:08] we gave me about five minutes so let's
[1:19:11] get into this and then we'll talk about
[1:19:12] one God because let's go now to Exodus
[1:19:15] 20 now we have always said that the
[1:19:20] seals and the and the
[1:19:23] the Ten Commandments were intertwined
[1:19:26] because if this is my thought whatever
[1:19:31] was in that Old Testament we get that
[1:19:34] plus we get that plus a greater
[1:19:38] understanding because remember Paul
[1:19:40] tells us I believe it's in Corinthians
[1:19:42] or maybe in Galatians he says these are
[1:19:44] all
[1:19:44] given to us for examples to whom the end
[1:19:48] of the world has come to so we've come
[1:19:49] to the very end of the world and there's
[1:19:52] really no other man am i that loud these
[1:19:55] things are going off but there's nothing
[1:19:59] else we're at the end of the book so we
[1:20:03] can turn back and we can use every
[1:20:05] resource from Adam even past Adam
[1:20:07] Genesis 1 goes back into eternity comes
[1:20:10] down to right here we can use all them
[1:20:13] for examples but remember in the New
[1:20:15] Testament those are not examples that's
[1:20:19] people with the Holy Ghost that's people
[1:20:22] with Christ in their soul but still they
[1:20:27] were looking forward to a time when a
[1:20:30] group of people it's gonna take the full
[1:20:33] revelation and God's make all these
[1:20:36] words saying I am THE LORD thy God which
[1:20:38] you have brought thee out of the land of
[1:20:39] Egypt out of the house of bondage thou
[1:20:42] shalt have no other gods before me
[1:20:46] thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[1:20:48] image or any likeness of anything that
[1:20:51] is in heaven above or that is in the
[1:20:53] earth beneath or that is in the water
[1:20:55] under the earth thou shalt not bow down
[1:20:58] thyself to them nor serve them for I the
[1:21:02] LORD thy God am a jealous God there's
[1:21:05] that word again visiting the iniquity of
[1:21:07] the father's upon the children unto the
[1:21:09] third and fourth generation of them that
[1:21:12] hate me is that all right say Amen so
[1:21:17] that's your first commandment amen so
[1:21:26] now
[1:21:28] we got a first sale was a hot white
[1:21:34] right was a white horse and we don't
[1:21:40] talk about it much but there was a man
[1:21:41] on that horse
[1:21:42] right now we said before in the law of
[1:21:47] contrast there was a white righteous
[1:21:48] church on the earth in the time that
[1:21:51] this white horse or white horse with a
[1:21:53] man on it developed his doctrine
[1:21:55] what was his doctrine to divide God into
[1:22:05] three pieces a man he took the first
[1:22:09] commandment he took the first
[1:22:13] commandment and said I'm gonna destroy
[1:22:17] it I'm gonna make it look good cuz you
[1:22:21] can't this guy didn't come out with some
[1:22:23] hideous looking something no it's
[1:22:25] beautiful
[1:22:25] the doctor was beautiful well if you
[1:22:30] deny the father you did another son you
[1:22:32] see what I'm saying so so they divided
[1:22:34] him up what is that that's not God God
[1:22:42] never wash three amen God never watch
[1:22:47] two he was 1 Deuteronomy 6:4 through
[1:22:56] five here o Israel the Lord our God is
[1:23:00] one Lord Satan said if I can get them to
[1:23:06] see an image of three and still be a
[1:23:11] white righteous Church I've done my job
[1:23:17] because listen and we'll stop it right
[1:23:21] here save time and then we'll continue
[1:23:23] this is what will be startling next
[1:23:25] Sunday but to that first seal shows one
[1:23:30] true and living God because remember
[1:23:33] when brother Branham goes over to
[1:23:35] Matthew 24
[1:23:38] what does Matthew 24 say
[1:23:41] take heed that no man deceive you for
[1:23:45] many shall come in my name saying I am
[1:23:48] Christ and shall deceive many those
[1:23:55] remember that that tops your seals
[1:23:56] matthew 24:4 through what I just read
[1:24:01] four through four and five Jesus told
[1:24:05] them take heed that no man deceive you
[1:24:07] listen the biggest deception is two
[1:24:09] things Trinitarian doctrine and Father
[1:24:12] Son Holy Ghost baptism and that all
[1:24:15] developed right at the end when he was
[1:24:18] getting ready to get off this horse in
[1:24:19] that thirst third Church agent get on
[1:24:21] that other horse
[1:24:22] the next one which is read right all
[1:24:27] right white red black when he gets ready
[1:24:30] to get on that red horse he has already
[1:24:32] formulated an idol an image amen that's
[1:24:40] what the first that's what the first
[1:24:42] commandment says don't have no other God
[1:24:44] before me don't have no other Idol or
[1:24:48] image that you worship now the whole
[1:24:52] world worships the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] baptism they embrace it kill you for it
[1:24:59] same thing with the Trinity honestly go
[1:25:03] talk to somebody go out go out and talk
[1:25:05] to somebody ask the Methodists or
[1:25:06] Baptists there no dick there and just
[1:25:08] ask them saying what is this about a
[1:25:11] Trinity and they'll give you all the way
[1:25:15] back to what grandma saying but it's a
[1:25:19] lot it's a lot of that white horse with
[1:25:23] that man riding on it it's a lie it's a
[1:25:27] bluff remember the property guard let's
[1:25:29] stand Allah come we're gonna do
[1:25:32] communion so we won't if anybody needs
[1:25:33] anything we'll pray for you but I tell
[1:25:36] you what I've seen people heal taking
[1:25:39] communion amen
[1:25:40] so to me that is a that is one of the
[1:25:43] ordinances that we we are commissioned
[1:25:45] to keep and I tell you if you keep it
[1:25:47] God will honor it but see brother
[1:25:50] Branham walks up one day and he remember
[1:25:52] he that table come
[1:25:54] up off the ground that table comes up
[1:25:58] starts floating the demons or floating
[1:26:00] tables around the room prophet of God
[1:26:02] walks and he said in the name of the
[1:26:03] Father Son Holy Ghost he said fall never
[1:26:07] paid him any attention why that's an
[1:26:09] idol right that's that man of sin the
[1:26:12] mystery of iniquity but when he said in
[1:26:15] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hit
[1:26:17] the ground that thing hit the ground
[1:26:19] baton doctor knocked the legs off of it
[1:26:21] why there's power in sin that this is
[1:26:26] the Antichrist because he's standing
[1:26:29] here one God with a book in his hand and
[1:26:33] there goes the man of sin there goes the
[1:26:38] man this give you trouble
[1:26:40] all of your life oh he doesn't I've

[1:27:14] off at seven I woke up at five o'clock
[1:27:16] just as wide awake and I just went you
[1:27:19] know what

[1:27:23] did and how this wanted on I went in
[1:27:26] there and I got sermon boot devil I went
[1:27:31] in guys sermon for about two hours i sat
[1:27:35] there and I read quotes and I read the
[1:27:37] Bible and I said ain't wasting time on
[1:27:39] this one I'm gonna go ahead and get my
[1:27:42] sermon so but tomorrow I mean next
[1:27:44] Sunday we'll talk more about this one
[1:27:46] God because remember that's where
[1:27:48] everything turned in that in those first
[1:27:52] three ages when that Trinitarian
[1:27:54] doctrine came out that not was not of
[1:27:56] God now listen
[1:27:57] God winked it to ignorance of people
[1:28:00] he's going to save those who believe a
[1:28:03] man and he had children in there he had
[1:28:07] children that were about
[1:28:08] under that false baptism but remember if
[1:28:11] he justified you he didn't count it
[1:28:14] against you right amen hey man if he
[1:28:19] justified that group of people he didn't
[1:28:21] count Martin Luther's drinking and
[1:28:23] smoking against him now you better not
[1:28:26] do that call this counted against you
[1:28:29] once you get in that holy hose you won't
[1:28:31] won't ever do that again
[1:28:33] that all rights a man but we'll talk
[1:28:37] about one guard next undies for just a
[1:28:39] little while under that first seal
[1:28:41] we'll see how it ties in but you see how
[1:28:45] beautifully it is fixed it's tying in to
[1:28:46] the even to the to the Ten Commandments
[1:28:49] first seal first commandment don't have
[1:28:52] no idols don't have no graven image now
[1:28:56] how many of them we we lived under an
[1:28:58] image there wasn't it was an image to
[1:29:00] the Beast that's why I live before the
[1:29:03] gut before God saved my soul I live for
[1:29:06] that image and you know what you can
[1:29:08] call it whatever you want to call it
[1:29:10] drinking smoking gambling cussing run
[1:29:12] around pornography television whatever
[1:29:14] you wanna call it that was your Idol
[1:29:16] before you came to God amen but now look
[1:29:21] let's bring the deception a little
[1:29:23] higher bring him into church and you
[1:29:29] better get rid of that three-guard thing
[1:29:31] you better get rid of that father son
[1:29:34] Holy Ghost baptism that's why
[1:29:36] repent of all that just you've done and
[1:29:40] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:43] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:29:45] shall receive that holy of holies god
[1:29:49] bless you let's pray before we take
[1:29:50] communion dear Lord Jesus thank you for
[1:29:53] the day thank you for the time we've
[1:29:55] been given thank you for the Word of God
[1:29:57] that we've heard today Lord thank you
[1:29:59] for the people they've come to sit and
[1:30:01] listen and to hear from you father we
[1:30:04] pray that as we always say that you'll
[1:30:06] give us revelation because well without
[1:30:09] you there is none there's just an image
[1:30:11] image to a beef not that not that image
[1:30:14] you saw Lord you saw an image in Genesis
[1:30:16] 1 and it had nothing to do with Satan it
[1:30:19] had nothing to do with sin that Genesis
[1:30:22] 1:26 man stood perfect clean no problems
[1:30:27] Lord may we have faith that that same
[1:30:31] man standing here today at Genesis 1:26
[1:30:34] man never died never fell he came to us
[1:30:38] and give us a birth inside of our soul
[1:30:40] and now we pray Lord that you'll
[1:30:43] continue to birth of birth to virtues
[1:30:46] birth that perfect love all those things
[1:30:48] that that we know that we're coming to
[1:30:51] Lord we pray that you would birth us
[1:30:52] into that forgive us of our sins Lord
[1:30:55] we're getting ready to take communion
[1:30:56] father just cleanse us we stand complete
[1:31:01] in you and justifying but we still have
[1:31:04] our Democrat old carnal mind that we got
[1:31:07] to contend with that reminds us of all
[1:31:08] the bad things that we do well father
[1:31:11] maybe we're once we run that through the
[1:31:13] filter of the word once we run that
[1:31:15] through the filter of that Holy Ghost
[1:31:17] that all just goes away sin less than
[1:31:21] our mind Lord said less than our spirit
[1:31:23] father that you'll give us revelation
[1:31:26] Lord now more than ever all the new ones
[1:31:29] coming in and the young ones man they're
[1:31:31] just they're just coming in so fast that
[1:31:33] levinthal worker is doing his job and I

[1:32:49] into our scripture and first Corinthians
[1:32:53] 11:23 or I have received for I have
[1:32:59] received of the Lord that which I
[1:33:01] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:33:04] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:33:06] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:33:09] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:33:13] body which is broken for you
[1:33:15] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:33:19] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:33:21] had supped saying this cup is the New
[1:33:25] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:33:28] as you drink it in remembrance of me
[1:33:30] first often as you eat this bread and
[1:33:33] drink this cup you do shew the Lord's
[1:33:36] death till he come or for whosoever
[1:33:39] shall eat of this bread and drink of
[1:33:42] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:33:45] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:33:46] but a little man examine himself and so
[1:33:50] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:33:53] that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:33:55] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:33:57] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:34:00] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:34:04] sickly among you and many sleep for we
[1:34:07] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:34:09] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:34:13] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:34:15] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:34:18] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:34:20] tarry one for another anything a man
[1:34:23] hungrily to hunger let him eat at home
[1:34:26] that you come not together unto
[1:34:28] condemnation the rest I said in order
[1:34:32] come let's just take a moment and just
[1:34:35] have a silent prayer praying one for the
[1:34:39] other and print the Lord would take care
[1:34:42] of things and all for we're going into
[1:34:43] this part and ask the Lord to make us
[1:34:46] worthy to be able to take the communion
[1:34:59] you
