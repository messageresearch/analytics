[4:31] for a world of lost sinners

[5:24] it has a
[5:25] wondrous attraction

[5:33] for the dear
[5:35] lamb of god
[5:37] he left his glory
[5:40] above
[5:42] to bear into
[5:44] dark calvary
[5:50] so i'll
[6:03] i

[7:51] me someday
[7:53] to my home not so far away we're his
[7:59] glory forever
[8:18] i lay down
[8:22] and i will cling

[14:28] the lord we had a real good time
[14:30] yesterday at the fellowship meeting
[14:32] enjoyed it a good safe trip over and
[14:34] back i think they wound up being 38 of
[14:37] us
[14:38] which was probably
[14:40] over high for what was there or close
[14:43] but we had a good time fellowshipping
[14:45] together and and all and just riding and
[14:48] and all and
[14:50] had a good time so we appreciate
[14:52] everybody for going and doing and
[14:53] fellowshipping amen brother luis will be
[14:56] on his way back tomorrow
[14:59] yeah well
[15:01] we got to get the time frame he comes in
[15:03] nine something in the morning so i guess
[15:05] he's doing but he's preaching
[15:07] today is that right preaching today well
[15:10] we appreciate that we're glad the lord
[15:11] touched him because he lost his voice
[15:14] and and everything and we just really
[15:16] appreciate the lord being with him and
[15:18] taking care of him man any other
[15:20] announcements we need to make
[15:22] we
[15:24] remember the band quit sweetheart band
[15:27] quit
[15:28] and i'll remember that and just sign up
[15:30] downstairs get everything ready for it
[15:32] and that the lord will take care of all
[15:34] things we appreciate all of it and just
[15:37] pray the lord would bless what we'd like
[15:39] to do if they'll turn the thing the
[15:42] machine around and view on brother gary
[15:44] over there if you want to see a miracle
[15:48] just take a look
[15:50] all right
[15:56] because a few weeks ago
[15:59] he was in very terrible shape
[16:02] and uh
[16:03] i don't
[16:04] try to say a lot of things but just say
[16:06] this
[16:07] uh if he remembers
[16:10] i said uh
[16:11] we're going one day at a time
[16:15] so we talk now and it's what he says
[16:17] we're going one day at a time
[16:19] well see that header
[16:22] little more meaning than just one day at
[16:24] a time
[16:25] because i knew then that he had
[16:29] reached the bottom
[16:31] and he was
[16:33] on the bottom he'll tell you that
[16:35] very very low
[16:36] and very
[16:38] sick
[16:39] and i knew that something had to happen
[16:42] so
[16:43] i had to put it on by faith hallelujah
[16:46] my faith about what i preached
[16:50] all right
[16:52] you see why can't you put
[16:54] your faith on what you believe right
[16:57] try it sometimes i've always tried to
[16:59] tell you a little secret when somebody's
[17:01] preaching and you
[17:03] see it
[17:04] raise your hands and say
[17:06] my family
[17:09] you might find out it'll work
[17:12] you know
[17:13] but i knew then he was going to make a
[17:15] turnaround
[17:18] i wasn't expecting it this quick
[17:20] you know i'm honest
[17:22] i don't worry about you know how long it
[17:24] takes for god to do things
[17:26] we just ask him to do it and he takes
[17:28] care of it
[17:29] so he'll do that and we appreciate god
[17:31] for being so wonderful
[17:32] to us to do that for you know and just
[17:36] you know
[17:37] tell brother gary that you're glad he's
[17:38] back
[17:39] but if you've got a coal or a coffin get
[17:41] away from him
[17:43] okay
[17:44] we're playing
[17:46] don't be foolish and say my coal ain't
[17:49] gonna get to him
[17:51] no we we're just human beings
[17:54] make it right
[17:56] i told him i said put you on a mask and
[17:58] word i said if you want to everybody in
[18:00] the building to put on one.
[18:02] oh we don't worry about it
[18:05] because we believe god's a healer but
[18:07] we're not dumb either
[18:08] we don't go around running down the
[18:10] railroad track and saying well the train
[18:12] ain't going to kill me because god's a
[18:13] deliverer
[18:15] no we do everything in the right order
[18:17] right
[18:18] i'm doing that so all right are you
[18:20] ready for the word are you enjoying the
[18:21] series
[18:22] that our brother's bringing them to us
[18:25] about the stature of a perfect man we
[18:27] appreciate that all right let's sing
[18:28] open the eyes of my heart as white comes
[18:30] to
[18:31] minister the word of the lord remember
[18:33] the sims family my uh brother-in-law

[18:46] gillsville uh he was a good brother you
[18:49] know brother-in-law uh just a good
[18:52] baptist christian
[18:53] and all so we pray that
[18:55] the lord will take care of him and
[18:57] that's between him and the lord what he
[18:59] is because we have nothing to do with
[19:01] those things
[19:02] but we know and believe that god is
[19:04] is the savior and deliverer and can do a
[19:07] lot of things if we ask him right open
[19:10] the eyes of my heart lord

[21:20] so
[21:22] i said lord
[21:23] if i get something out there
[21:25] wipe it off
[21:27] when i get through the door
[21:29] let that thing just run down like
[21:30] aaron's
[21:31] you know they poured errands they poured
[21:33] oil all over aaron's head and it ran all
[21:35] the way down to his feet well you know
[21:36] what that was the protection that aaron
[21:38] had he had that protection of that oil
[21:40] running all the way down to his feet
[21:43] there is a type of the holy ghost
[21:45] same way with you and i everybody like
[21:47] that amen
[21:48] everybody see that i like that because
[21:50] that's what we're talking about we're
[21:52] not talking about you or me we're
[21:53] talking about jesus christ
[21:55] he is the centerpiece of the whole thing
[21:58] and then being with the statue of a
[22:00] perfect man
[22:01] it's the centerpiece of the whole of the
[22:03] whole message so uh if you've got your
[22:05] bibles go ahead let's turn to ii peter
[22:08] 1
[22:09] and
[22:11] read their our scripture as we always do
[22:14] we all had a wonderful time like they
[22:16] said
[22:16] in the fellowship meeting yesterday
[22:18] thanks for the 38 people that overcame
[22:20] and
[22:21] and went with us so
[22:23] and got home safe and everybody's okay
[22:25] today so
[22:27] those of you that scared you might
[22:29] catch something and
[22:31] all of us came back just fine
[22:35] it's going to be here in march so maybe
[22:37] some of you'll be able to come
[22:40] in march the third saturday in march
[22:42] we'll have it here at the
[22:44] at the church so keep that in mind also
[22:46] uh by way of a few more announcements
[22:49] um
[22:51] at road number five down here
[22:54] which is two roads from us
[22:57] there's a rabid cat they have the cat
[23:01] but it's already bit three people three
[23:03] elderly people have been bit and they
[23:05] have been take having to take rabies
[23:08] vaccination shots so it's just not this
[23:10] street or the next one where the
[23:13] next church is but it's the next street
[23:14] over so
[23:17] um
[23:18] tell your children do not play with any
[23:20] cat
[23:21] our dog doesn't matter raccoons or
[23:23] anything else because there is
[23:26] a case of rabies in the community so
[23:29] we pray that each one of you will uh
[23:31] we'll take that in into consideration
[23:33] because we have had those cats running
[23:35] around out here
[23:36] so be careful
[23:38] because they are rabbit i know they took
[23:39] one but now i don't know you don't know
[23:42] how many they've infected so let's just
[23:44] keep also keep the little cats in a
[23:46] prayer that they'll get rid of that
[23:48] stuff because it's not natural for them
[23:49] to have that
[23:50] all right it's something given to them
[23:53] but uh
[23:54] also remember that uh
[23:56] like i said brother luis will be coming
[23:58] back dad said we'll be picking him up
[24:00] tuesday morning lord willing at the
[24:01] airport

[24:12] keeping prayer there also keeping a
[24:14] prayer us going to me going to the
[24:15] philippines i say we and people are
[24:18] thinking that june's going but i mean we
[24:19] in the lord
[24:20] the lord's going and i'm going with him
[24:23] okay so i'm going by myself
[24:25] but i'm not going by myself that's why i

[24:29] but you know what really we are going
[24:32] we are going i'm taking you to the
[24:34] philippines with me
[24:35] and then maybe as they all say
[24:38] vicariously you can live out the
[24:40] journey of the philippines through me
[24:42] because i'm going to be doing a lot of
[24:43] picture taking
[24:44] and
[24:45] in sending reports we're going to be

[24:52] remember the family will be gone to this
[24:54] afternoon after second service to the uh
[24:57] to the funeral home for

[25:07] green's preaching so keep me in your
[25:08] prayers there

[25:13] i think it's going to be wonderful
[25:15] if you don't you should have just passed
[25:16] away by january the 1st
[25:18] okay
[25:19] if you're not looking for something good
[25:20] as a christian sure we're looking at all
[25:22] that we'll talk about a little bit about
[25:24] that today and show you something that
[25:25] maybe the lord showed me friday and i
[25:27] hope i can give it to you the way you
[25:28] give it to me you know brother branham
[25:30] always said that but it always happened
[25:32] you know he he got it to the people but
[25:35] they had to accept it and they had to re
[25:37] you know they had to take in and let
[25:38] their holy ghost
[25:40] reflect what brother branham brought and
[25:42] that's the same way with you and i you
[25:43] got to let the holy ghost reflect that's
[25:45] why the holy ghost is the most important
[25:46] thing because if it's not there there's
[25:48] no reflection there's no reflection of
[25:50] the word of god so ii peter 1 verse 10
[25:52] let's pray
[25:54] dear heavenly father we pray lord that
[25:56] you would be with us today
[25:58] sanctify us for this journey

[26:06] world and
[26:08] and let you talk to us father just a
[26:09] little bit

[26:47] second peter 1 verse 1 simon peter a
[26:49] servant and apostle of jesus christ to
[26:51] them that have obtained like precious
[26:53] faith
[26:54] so it's not
[26:55] for everybody
[26:57] all right but it is for everybody
[26:59] all right i i like what brother brother
[27:01] luke was preaching yesterday you know he
[27:03] was preaching on feast
[27:04] or fast
[27:07] we should be fasting well
[27:09] when we should be feasting we're fasting
[27:11] when we should be feasting we should be
[27:13] feasting on the word of god
[27:15] all right so that's saying we shouldn't
[27:16] feasting on the word of god are those
[27:18] that obtain like precious faith are
[27:20] feasting on the word of god okay because
[27:22] that's what you draw from or that's the
[27:24] strength that you draw from that you've
[27:26] obtained this light precious faith to us
[27:28] through the righteousness of god and our
[27:29] savior
[27:30] jesus christ never forgetting that grace
[27:33] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[27:34] the knowledge of god of jesus our lord
[27:37] according us his divine power hath given
[27:39] unto us all right something we have to
[27:41] we got to obtain because remember you've
[27:42] got to obtain it you got to go get it
[27:44] all right giving us all things that
[27:46] pertains unto life
[27:47] and godliness all right so we're going
[27:49] to start today a little bit more maybe
[27:50] up into virtue and talk about life and
[27:52] godliness through the knowledge of him
[27:54] that has called us to glory and virtue
[27:56] whereby our given unto us it's a gift
[27:59] exceeding great and precious promises
[28:01] but now remember god's not an indian
[28:02] giver when he gives you a gift it's
[28:04] yours amen brother brown said this is my
[28:06] eye god gave it to me so now when god
[28:08] give me the holy ghost it's my holy
[28:09] ghost right that's why we're going to
[28:11] the philippines me and my holy ghost are
[28:13] going to the philippines all right so
[28:14] we're going there so he give it to me
[28:16] it's mine he's not an indian giver or
[28:18] something we said well i'll give you
[28:19] this not give me that back no it's not
[28:21] that way it's a given gift
[28:24] great and precious promises that by
[28:26] these promises you might be partakers of
[28:28] the divine nature and what is the divine
[28:30] nature
[28:31] these virtues having escaped the
[28:33] corruption that is in the world through
[28:35] lush and beside this so besides your new
[28:38] birth i'm going to read a quote
[28:39] a quote today that's going to really
[28:41] astound you brother brown says
[28:43] faith alone won't do it right you say
[28:45] boy i got faith is everything yeah it is
[28:47] but brother brown said faith alone won't
[28:48] do it right
[28:49] okay and besides this giving all
[28:51] diligence
[28:52] add to your faith virtue and divert your
[28:54] knowledge and all these temperaments
[28:55] tempers patience patience godliness the
[28:57] godless brother of kindness and the
[28:58] brother kindness charity for if these
[29:01] things be in you and abound
[29:03] overflow they make you that you shall
[29:05] neither be barren or unfruitful in the
[29:07] knowledge of our lord jesus christ but
[29:09] he that lacketh these things is blind
[29:11] and cannot see afar off and has
[29:13] forgotten that he was purged from his
[29:15] old sins
[29:16] wherefore the rather brethren give
[29:18] diligence look at that word diligence i
[29:19] like that word diligence to make your
[29:21] calling and election sure for if you do
[29:23] these things
[29:25] you shall never fall lord bless his word
[29:27] and you may be seated
[29:29] you shall never fall now that's the
[29:30] promise that you ought to put like i
[29:32] said you ought to put that on your
[29:33] refrigerator you shall never
[29:35] fall
[29:36] amen
[29:38] so now last sunday we're talking about
[29:40] we come up through justification
[29:42] sanctification the baptism of holy ghost
[29:45] and we showed that this actually
[29:47] was
[29:49] the well we'll look at the chart here go
[29:51] ahead and pull it out we'll do it now
[29:53] we've we've
[29:54] we've um
[29:56] i don't like the word add to because you
[29:57] can't add to the word and you can't add
[29:59] to brother brown's chart okay but you
[30:01] can expand it a little bit and make it
[30:04] work a little bit to show excuse me the
[30:06] show because see faith
[30:08] equals a new birth equals the holy ghost
[30:10] is that right right so that's what we're
[30:12] talking about when we're talking about
[30:13] faith we're talking about the new birth
[30:14] amen faith is a revelation all right the
[30:17] new birth is a revelation the holy ghost
[30:19] is a revelation all right so that's
[30:21] that's your foundation faith equals a
[30:23] new birth equals the holy ghost and then
[30:25] we showed with justification and
[30:27] sanctification
[30:29] leads you to the new birth all right
[30:31] it's not the new birth
[30:33] all right but it leads you to the new
[30:34] birth and then you go all the way up
[30:36] leave that up
[30:37] so now we see that it takes the new
[30:40] birth to put us inside into the body of
[30:43] christ because you saw the chart where
[30:45] where jesus was standing inside the
[30:47] pyramid to put you inside the body of
[30:49] christ you have to be born again all
[30:52] right so now in justification and
[30:54] sanctification obviously you're working
[30:56] toward that
[30:57] but you're not in yet because listen
[31:00] just for a moment it's really simple but
[31:02] sometimes you need to explain it for all
[31:04] of us new ones and the ones that are
[31:06] slow of heart jesus said old fool and
[31:08] slow of heart well i was probably one of
[31:09] those all right
[31:11] so
[31:12] you know the brother said yesterday that
[31:13] jesus was
[31:15] was meek and mild well yay was but still
[31:18] when he walked in that temple
[31:20] he said you bunch of hypocrites your
[31:22] daddy is not my daddy now if i would say
[31:24] that to you guys y'all would think i was
[31:26] i was a little bit arrogant
[31:29] but it was the truth
[31:32] the truth is what hurts
[31:34] right
[31:36] if you're born again today i can talk
[31:37] about you being a devil all
[31:39] all day long and it won't bother you a
[31:40] bit right
[31:42] shouldn't amen all right so uh but i
[31:45] think jesus was put here for a purpose
[31:48] but and we're not to be arrogant but
[31:50] we're we're to be confident jesus was
[31:52] confident what he was doing he's trying
[31:53] to save him he's trying to get him to
[31:54] see that they were lost
[31:56] all right the same way with us i i'm
[31:58] like brother dale i see that more and
[31:59] more i wish that i could preach
[32:01] something that would convict you and
[32:03] convince you that you're lost
[32:06] because then you can start and say well
[32:08] i need to
[32:09] be forgiven of my past sins i need to be
[32:11] sanctified but all this all this junk
[32:15] that has been preached not of the
[32:17] message but in the message
[32:19] about just believing and you've got it
[32:21] no you've still got to go through those
[32:22] three stages of grace
[32:24] to be
[32:26] in the body of christ to have faith to
[32:28] have the new birth to have the holy
[32:29] ghost
[32:30] all right and remember these are
[32:32] requirements
[32:34] but you got to have a desire because
[32:35] diligence and desire is kind of the same
[32:38] thing
[32:39] to be diligent you got to have a desire
[32:41] to do it all right same way in life if
[32:44] we if we have something that we're
[32:45] working on if we're diligent toward that
[32:47] that means we have a desire
[32:49] okay
[32:50] we have a desire to
[32:52] to do better we should have a desire to
[32:54] do better in life i was thinking
[32:56] yesterday driving over to the fellowship
[32:57] meeting
[32:58] that
[33:01] us being humans
[33:03] we have to have we need a plan because
[33:05] remember the old adage
[33:07] in business that if you
[33:09] fail to plan your plan will always fail
[33:12] yeah okay same thing in like saying
[33:15] brother branham said god had a plan
[33:17] it's just that he don't plan and it
[33:18] fails
[33:20] he plans and it's eternal
[33:22] his plan is perfect what we've got to do
[33:24] though is is we've got to come into that
[33:26] part of the plan
[33:28] he made the plan and it's perfect not
[33:30] like me and you we'll make a plan and
[33:31] we'll say well now uh that didn't work
[33:34] too well let's shift over here no god
[33:35] when he made a plan that's the way it's
[33:37] got to be and you know what it's very
[33:39] simple
[33:40] because if the most illiterate person
[33:42] can get born again and you know what
[33:44] peter still couldn't sign his name and
[33:46] he was right there right right amen
[33:49] amen but he had the virtues working in
[33:51] his life because he trusted god and not
[33:54] lean to his education
[33:56] all right
[33:57] i don't advocate it literacy none at all
[33:59] i want your kids to go to school
[34:02] and finish
[34:04] go to college and finish
[34:07] make good money so you can pay good
[34:09] tithes
[34:14] that's what that brother said ron
[34:15] spencer is a little boy you know he
[34:16] comes up and he says uh they're gonna
[34:18] sign me for he had a boy in his church
[34:20] that was real good in college and he was
[34:22] getting ready to go the pros and he said
[34:24] brother ron he said what do you think
[34:25] about about this is this okay if i you
[34:28] know he said well follow your dream son
[34:29] he said just when you get that 20
[34:31] million dollar contract in the pros he
[34:32] said don't forget to pay your tithe
[34:40] ty's has to run the church you know
[34:43] that's just the point to make i want you
[34:45] to i want you to we hang toward that
[34:47] peter was illiterate and all these
[34:48] people were literate what i'm showing
[34:49] you is you don't have to have a lot of
[34:51] book smarts right to be to be in god to
[34:54] be in christ and there's no there's no
[34:56] uh there's no big eyes and little use i
[34:58] mean sometimes and truly brother brown
[35:00] was saying our education does get in our
[35:02] way because it's our it's our philosophy
[35:04] that gets in the way that that a teacher
[35:06] has taught us you know out in the world
[35:09] so but we need to be taught but if we're
[35:10] taught by god then that'll never fail
[35:13] all right so his plan will never fail so
[35:15] his plan is so we got to have a plan
[35:18] we've got to enter into that same plan
[35:20] we don't need to make our own plan
[35:24] we need to just take god's plan
[35:26] and say all right this is what we've got
[35:27] to do and we got to be diligent as it
[35:29] said in first peter wait a second peter
[35:32] we got to be diligent about what we do
[35:34] so this is a diligence that we've got to
[35:36] do overcoming
[35:37] and remember we've got to suffer
[35:40] we must suffer to reign with him all
[35:42] right i'm just kind of backing up a
[35:43] little bit for some that weren't here or
[35:45] or what more but we come last sunday in
[35:48] justification and sanctification we come
[35:50] up to this to the new birth and we
[35:52] talked about that and we read ephesians
[35:54] let's go to ephesians 4. i'm just kind
[35:56] of condensed some of these scriptures
[35:58] down
[35:59] as a background
[36:00] i want to try to get into virtue and
[36:02] maybe knowledge this afternoon but this
[36:05] is how we get it now he gave some
[36:07] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[36:09] and some pastors and teachers for the
[36:11] perfecting of the saints so the only way
[36:13] you're going to get is you're going to
[36:14] have to hear
[36:15] all right for the work of the ministry
[36:17] for the edifying of the body of christ
[36:19] till we all come in the unity of the
[36:22] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[36:24] god that's what i told him down in the
[36:25] sunday school class i don't want to i
[36:27] don't want to look at sister trudy
[36:29] mcmillan and say now trudy you've got to
[36:30] have
[36:31] that's not my business
[36:33] right i can tell you what you got to
[36:34] have sure by the word of god but what i
[36:36] want is different maybe than what god
[36:38] wants
[36:39] because you know you may have a temper
[36:41] in your life and i said well i want you
[36:42] to not have that temper
[36:44] well if you want to keep it god's not
[36:46] going to take it away from you and i'm
[36:48] sure not going to take it away from you
[36:49] i'm probably going to enhance it just a
[36:51] little bit
[37:01] hallelujah
[37:02] till we all come
[37:06] brother brown said god put somebody in
[37:07] your way and say something see oh you
[37:09] react
[37:11] till we all come in the unity of the
[37:12] faith to the knowledge of the son of god
[37:14] what i'm trying to say is i don't want
[37:16] everybody in this church to just say
[37:18] well i got virtue this one's got no you
[37:20] worry about yourself right
[37:22] we worry about our own self we work you
[37:24] know i i go home with me you go home
[37:26] with you
[37:28] okay and god is with you the whole time
[37:30] he knows what you need right okay
[37:33] till we all come to the unity of the
[37:34] faith of the knowledge of the son of god
[37:36] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[37:38] the stature of the fullness of christ
[37:41] all right so that starts though with
[37:44] what we want to start with is baby form
[37:46] faith now let's go to hebrews
[37:49] verse 13 and 14.
[37:52] so peter showed us what we needed
[37:55] paul showed us how to get it all right
[37:57] so this is the plan
[37:59] the plan of god the plan of god is is
[38:01] for peter to show us what it is and for
[38:04] paul to show us how to get it
[38:05] now
[38:07] hebrews 5 verse 13 for everyone that is
[38:09] that useth milk is unskillful in the
[38:11] word of righteousness for he is a babe
[38:14] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[38:17] are of full age even those who by reason
[38:20] of what
[38:21] use
[38:23] by reason of use have their senses
[38:25] exercised to do what discern and we're
[38:27] going to talk about that in knowledge
[38:29] because to me knowledge is discernment
[38:32] amen both good to discern what both good
[38:35] and evil not just good or not just evil
[38:38] both good and evil
[38:39] the holy ghost is given to us
[38:41] but you know what we've got to do what
[38:44] use it exercise our faith all right
[38:50] hebrews 6 verse 1
[38:53] through 3.
[38:55] therefore we read this last sunday
[38:57] because we were on the foundation today
[38:59] we're going to
[39:00] speak on
[39:01] add to your faith
[39:04] all right because that's what the
[39:05] scripture says add to your faith you've
[39:07] got to obtain a faith
[39:09] and then you've got to add to it
[39:11] therefore leaving the principles of the
[39:13] doctrine of christ let us go on into
[39:16] perfection not laying again the
[39:17] foundation of repentance from dead works
[39:20] and of faith toward god what our problem
[39:22] is
[39:23] a lot of times and we'll talk about in a
[39:24] few minutes in that outer court and even
[39:27] in the inner court
[39:28] we have problems
[39:30] and we're in and out
[39:32] we go back to the to look to the
[39:34] foundation of repentance now listen
[39:36] we're to repent every day right
[39:38] but we're not to repent of the sins that
[39:40] we did that we repented of
[39:42] back when we should have been justified
[39:44] everybody got that sure it's like
[39:46] brother was talking yesterday god
[39:48] reminds him i mean sorry the devil
[39:50] reminds us of all that but god in his
[39:52] word said he would forget him
[39:55] he's already forget them forgot him
[39:57] never sees them even though we did them
[40:00] right
[40:01] and i have to depend and see i put my
[40:03] faith on that i put my faith on that god
[40:06] forgot
[40:07] i don't care whether the devil
[40:09] remembered but god forgot but let's
[40:11] don't keep going back because what we do
[40:12] is we move a little bit forward and we
[40:14] go back to that kind of repentance
[40:18] the justification part where we turned
[40:20] away from our past sins forget those
[40:23] people there's nothing you can do about
[40:24] it anyway
[40:27] that's all you can do is come down to
[40:28] repentance you can't go back and make it
[40:30] right a lot of it you can't
[40:34] amen
[40:37] not laying again the foundation so we're
[40:39] not putting a foundation and like he
[40:41] said we're not coming back and laying
[40:42] another one
[40:43] there's one foundation and that's faith
[40:46] of repentance from dead works and of
[40:48] faith toward god of the doctrine of
[40:50] baptism and of laying on hands and the
[40:52] resurrection of the dead and of eternal
[40:54] judgment and this will we do if god
[40:57] permit and i believe you will
[41:00] we had an instance not too long ago
[41:02] where brother came to
[41:04] to us about communion and said well
[41:06] every time i repent do i need to go get
[41:08] baptized again no
[41:10] that's what he's saying here don't let's
[41:11] don't go back and say
[41:13] man if i had to go back and get baptized
[41:15] for all the things i did
[41:16] i couldn't get anything done
[41:19] except stay in the water
[41:21] but we got to realize though that when i
[41:22] went down in that water in january back
[41:24] there in 1998
[41:27] that stayed there i don't have to do it
[41:29] again amen if that was true repentance i
[41:32] don't have to go back to that that's
[41:34] what paul's talking about we don't have
[41:36] to go back to that
[41:39] sure it's okay to get baptized again if
[41:41] you didn't think this one was right
[41:44] or you were right
[41:46] amen
[41:47] because remember that's just a that's
[41:49] what a good conscious it gives you a
[41:51] good conscience that my sins were rolled
[41:54] away of my repentance and then for the
[41:57] outward appearance of people i was
[42:00] baptized same way with you because it
[42:02] doesn't take away your sins
[42:04] but it is an outward expression of an
[42:06] inward work
[42:08] all right so that's what paul's saying
[42:10] you don't have to go back to that every
[42:11] time every time you sin you don't have
[42:12] to go be baptized again of the doctrine
[42:14] of baptism and of laying on of hands on
[42:16] the resurrection of the dead of eternal
[42:18] judgment
[42:19] and this will we do
[42:20] if god permits all right let's go to
[42:23] hebrews 11
[42:25] 6 that's what we were talking about last
[42:27] sunday but without faith
[42:30] it is impossible to please him who god
[42:33] right for he that cometh to god must
[42:36] believe that he is is what god
[42:39] you must believe he's god if you're
[42:40] going to believe in god you must believe
[42:42] he's god right all right
[42:44] i like that you got to believe he's god
[42:48] because remember this is all based on
[42:49] faith and faith is what believing
[42:52] we're going to read that in just a
[42:53] minute we're going to read the
[42:54] definition of of faith because i didn't
[42:56] read it last sunday but you must believe
[42:58] that he is what god total god exactly
[43:01] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[43:03] and forever
[43:04] and a rewarder of them that there's that
[43:06] word again diligently seek him
[43:10] not dilatory diligent
[43:13] we must be diligent to seek god
[43:15] you know why because god knows we have
[43:17] to be diligent to seek him
[43:20] if not
[43:21] we let the devil in
[43:23] all right so now we go to hebrews 11.
[43:31] verse 1.
[43:33] we're just going to read verse 1. now
[43:35] faith is the substance of things hoped
[43:37] for
[43:38] the evidence of things not seen
[43:42] because remember it's like brother
[43:44] branham said it's not faith
[43:47] i don't have to have faith that june's
[43:49] here today
[43:51] i see her right
[43:53] so i don't my faith in that is not it's
[43:55] not it's not going to work
[43:58] now if she's gone somewhere and in a car
[44:00] and i don't know where she is then i've
[44:02] got to have faith that god's going to
[44:04] bring her here but now for her sitting
[44:05] there today i don't have to have faith
[44:07] for that
[44:08] because look same way with your new
[44:10] birth if you're born again you don't
[44:12] have to have faith to get born again
[44:14] again right now sure we know being born
[44:16] again but i'm talking about the one when
[44:18] he burns that soul out and puts himself
[44:20] in
[44:21] you don't have to go back through that
[44:23] again
[44:25] amen you don't have to go back that's
[44:26] why you got to settle this thing we if i
[44:29] don't if nothing else happens between
[44:30] this whole series settle one thing that
[44:33] you're born again
[44:34] because god can work with you then
[44:37] if you're born again
[44:39] now let's look at what the greek lexicon
[44:40] says about that word
[44:44] let's go to the definition brother
[44:47] it's
[44:48] pistus which is faith assurance
[44:52] believe belief
[44:54] then that belief
[44:56] fidelity
[44:58] conviction of the truth of anything
[45:00] belief look how many times that says
[45:01] belief so it's got to be something that
[45:03] you believe in right all right and this
[45:06] one in red i like this and relating to
[45:08] god it's the conviction that god exists
[45:11] and is the creator and ruler of all
[45:14] things the provider and bestower of
[45:17] eternal salvation
[45:19] through christ amen all right so that's
[45:21] what your faith must be based on it's
[45:23] like brother luke said yesterday we've
[45:25] got to know that that man right there
[45:28] died for us
[45:30] get away with our sins that's why he
[45:32] came that's the whole basis of
[45:33] christianity is faith not just faith
[45:37] it's faith in something right all right
[45:40] relating to christ a strong and welcome
[45:42] conviction or belief that jesus is the
[45:44] messiah through whom we obtain eternal
[45:47] salvation and the kingdom of god but
[45:50] look at that word belief belief
[45:52] belief of the predominant idea of trust
[45:55] where do we have to put our trust in in
[45:57] god right all right we put our trust in
[45:59] the word of god all right so look
[46:04] this is not just
[46:06] i hope so i think so
[46:08] maybe so
[46:10] this has got to be
[46:11] like i said hebrews there says we must
[46:14] believe that he is
[46:16] he is god
[46:18] and he's not going to change he's not
[46:19] going to have a different prayer we're
[46:21] not going to get halfway up the statue
[46:22] of perfect man's god is going to say no
[46:23] i think i'll change the plan
[46:25] now it's the plan forever for eternity
[46:28] that's god's plan forever settled in
[46:31] heaven and on earth
[46:32] all right
[46:34] so now let's go to
[46:36] uh back to the chart
[46:39] and i want to read you this quote over
[46:40] again i told you i like this and i'm
[46:42] going to keep reading it
[46:44] but just put the chart back up and we'll
[46:45] look at it again because i want to i
[46:47] want to mention something here that i
[46:48] didn't last weekend
[46:49] because we got to add to your faith so
[46:51] you got to have something before you can
[46:53] add right
[46:54] right it says add to your faith
[46:57] virtue so you got to have something to
[47:00] add that to all right and remember the
[47:03] foundation is faith and we never get
[47:05] away from that foundation of faith
[47:07] that's what i want you to see in just a
[47:08] few minutes that i believe may help you
[47:10] a little bit
[47:12] because sometimes when we look at this
[47:14] and we say well face at the bottom of
[47:15] the pyramid and then here i go working
[47:16] all the way up no people this faith all
[47:18] the way to the very top amen amen it's
[47:21] faith all the way do we leave this world
[47:23] it is faith
[47:24] all right now the first quote let's read
[47:26] it the statue of a perfect man
[47:28] paragraph 102 through 104. we're going
[47:30] to read that notice
[47:32] you must be born again
[47:34] and when you're born again you can't be
[47:36] born again without having faith so if
[47:38] you're born again you've got baby form
[47:40] faith amen you're a babe in christ so
[47:43] he's talking about drinking milk you are
[47:45] a baby you do have to start as a baby as
[47:47] a human being you have to start as a
[47:48] baby all right so as a christian you
[47:50] have to start as a baby
[47:54] that's right
[47:55] so you see on my chart here i got the
[47:57] very foundation faith is the foundation
[48:01] of it
[48:02] all right then he reads the same thing i
[48:04] read for without faith it's impossible
[48:05] to please god he that cometh to god must
[48:07] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[48:08] them that diligently seek him see he
[48:10] must be and we're a skeptic when you're
[48:12] a skeptic of the bible when you're
[48:14] skeptic of the word being right
[48:16] you just might as well stay back until
[48:18] you first believe it
[48:20] so there's the faith what is sin
[48:22] unbelief there's only two elements that
[48:24] controls the human being that's either
[48:27] doubt or faith one or the other
[48:29] you're possessed of one that dominates
[48:31] your life remember this quote i've read
[48:33] it every time i think i will read it
[48:34] every time you're possessed of one that
[48:37] dominates your life
[48:39] just depends on how much faith you have
[48:42] is how high you can rise
[48:44] but first it's got to be faith let me
[48:47] stay on the foundation for a while now
[48:48] faith is what you must believe
[48:50] faith is what faith the substance of
[48:52] things hope for right
[48:54] see the only way you you can't pull
[48:56] virtue out and show it to me like a like
[48:58] a gift like a box
[49:00] the only way you're going to show it to
[49:01] it me or anybody in the world is what
[49:03] comes out of you
[49:04] all right but first you got to have
[49:06] faith let's stay on that foundation
[49:07] faith is what faith's the substance of
[49:09] things hoped for it's you already have
[49:11] it when you have faith
[49:13] because it's revealed in faith faith is
[49:15] the substance of things hoped for
[49:16] hebrews 11 see the evidence what is it
[49:18] what kind of an evidence a holy evidence
[49:21] we have come into a holy part of our
[49:23] life that's going to dominate
[49:26] something's going to dominate you either
[49:28] faith or doubt it's going to dominate
[49:30] who you are amen now look pull the chart
[49:33] go back to the chart just for a minute i
[49:34] want just for a second
[49:36] to show us
[49:37] maybe what is happening to a lot of us
[49:40] and i think if you'll go to the entry
[49:42] veil i think it's in
[49:43] 1956 it really explains it well
[49:46] but see you have this is the outer court
[49:50] okay when you look go back to the jewish
[49:53] go back to the jewish layout of the
[49:54] temple
[49:55] the temple had an outer court and if you
[49:57] look at the court we don't have it here
[49:59] i was going to try to find one but
[50:00] that's okay we all know what it is it's
[50:02] an open-air court
[50:05] if it rains you're going to get wet
[50:07] right
[50:08] sun's shining you're going to get hot
[50:10] if it's cold you're going to be cold
[50:11] because that's your ups and downs in
[50:13] life amen that's but you're not in there
[50:16] yet but you're in the outer court you
[50:18] know you're beginning to head towards
[50:19] something and then sanctification you
[50:22] have a little more protection you go
[50:23] into
[50:24] uh the second the the second court
[50:27] right which has got a few things in it
[50:28] that's not in the first court
[50:32] even the first court was called the
[50:33] court of the gentiles because the
[50:34] gentiles could come around that court
[50:36] right but they couldn't go into that
[50:38] next one right and obviously
[50:41] they couldn't go into the holy of holies
[50:43] right
[50:44] because there was your protection there
[50:45] was where that you had to badger skins
[50:47] and you were protected from the weather
[50:49] it wasn't the only thing that was in
[50:51] there was a shekinah glory
[50:52] see of god and the bread you know that
[50:55] was just and then what the priests do he
[50:56] walked in there one time a year
[50:59] with what blood and that covered them it
[51:02] didn't take away their sins it covered
[51:04] them now look when you get into this
[51:06] inner court it doesn't cover your sin
[51:08] it eradicates your sin takes it all away
[51:11] so when you come into this court you're
[51:13] sinless that's right
[51:17] so the outer court inner court
[51:20] you can take your your first
[51:22] first part see you're not in you have a
[51:25] lot of problems
[51:27] then you're sanctified you come into a
[51:29] court where the where the candles are
[51:31] which is an artificial light
[51:34] right that's an artificial light you're
[51:37] walking to light but now remember when
[51:39] you get in here it was just there was no
[51:41] light there was just the shekinah glory
[51:43] of god
[51:44] amen so that's what we're looking at now
[51:47] the shekinah glory of god you have come
[51:49] in here by faith we boldly come to the
[51:52] throne now
[51:53] because we have that we boldly go to the
[51:55] throne of grace why because we don't
[51:58] have a remembrance sure we do but
[52:01] remember the priests went in and then
[52:03] the bible says i believe there in
[52:04] hebrews 6 the priest went in and he come
[52:06] out but there was a remembrance of sin
[52:09] right because the next year he had to go
[52:11] back in the same court again that's what
[52:13] paul said he said you don't have to go
[52:14] back and be born again again
[52:17] not now with the blood of jesus christ
[52:18] once you enter in
[52:20] behind the veil this is that holy of
[52:23] holies amen so now the statue of a
[52:26] perfect man has taken on a different
[52:27] meaning that's the holy of holies and
[52:30] it's you and god
[52:32] not you and god and your wife or husband
[52:34] or your pastor it's you and god
[52:37] in that holy of holies all right
[52:40] amen
[52:43] sure we're still going to have problems
[52:45] because we need virtual dollars
[52:46] temperatures and all that but it's not
[52:48] going to be the problems we have here
[52:50] i go to church i don't come to church i
[52:52] don't feel saved i do feel safe well you
[52:54] know what i don't feel saved either
[52:56] about 70 of the
[52:58] time but i have to trust in god not me
[53:04] because the devil's going to tell you
[53:05] ain't saved the day you die
[53:07] unless he wants to really deceive you
[53:08] until you're already saved and you're
[53:09] not even justified yet that's the whole
[53:12] problem you have to you got to be
[53:13] careful in the end time
[53:15] in the end time it's a little bit
[53:16] different than the other ones have to
[53:17] deal with satan is so close he's right
[53:21] he's right there yeah
[53:24] satan is right now i'm not going up in
[53:25] here he's right there yeah that's where
[53:28] the devil is he's right there
[53:31] i mean a fine line but you know what
[53:33] once you enter into that holy of holies
[53:35] brother branham said that curtain
[53:36] dropped
[53:38] it was just that priest and god right
[53:40] and that was it that's the same way with
[53:41] you and i once you enter into this
[53:43] statue of a perfect man i'm going to
[53:45] tell you something it'll change your
[53:46] life
[53:47] because the new birth absolutely will
[53:49] change you
[53:52] your thoughts and everything else
[53:54] but now let's go to romans 10 verse 17
[53:58] and talk i want to stay on faith just
[54:00] for a minute and then we're going to go
[54:04] to virtue
[54:06] so right here's how you get it
[54:08] here's the plan so then faith cometh by
[54:11] hearing
[54:12] and hearing by the word of god right i
[54:15] looked outside in sister monica's class
[54:17] they were all standing outside in the
[54:18] foyer back there let's pick him up who's
[54:20] got
[54:21] zoe pick yours up let me see them
[54:27] now bud faith comes by hearing
[54:30] you see them when they come in they had
[54:31] plates they cut the plate in half and
[54:33] put two big ears and they got a little
[54:34] thing across and they were all they said
[54:36] we're to hear you there anna's got one
[54:38] there for if you want to put the
[54:40] the uh put one of the cameras on that
[54:42] hold it up anna
[54:44] anna hold it up
[54:46] put it on would you
[54:48] there you go i told them i said give
[54:50] every one of them to the adults
[54:53] give them to the adults forget the kids
[54:55] give them to the adults
[54:56] because faith comes by hearing right
[54:59] and hearing by what
[55:02] word of god
[55:04] not an almanac or other things like that
[55:06] it comes by hearing the word of god
[55:09] all right so let's go to quote number
[55:11] two
[55:13] and let's just
[55:14] i just want to reiterate that brother
[55:16] branham never changed his view on the
[55:19] new birth right
[55:21] this is this is preached a year after
[55:23] the seals
[55:26] and he's still preaching on
[55:27] justification sanctification of baptism
[55:29] in the holy ghost i want to strike that
[55:30] home because
[55:32] many people in this message believe that
[55:34] that you don't have to go through that
[55:35] anymore that he changed
[55:37] his doctrine and i do not i don't
[55:38] believe that not he don't he didn't
[55:40] believe it either so if he didn't
[55:41] believe it i don't believe him
[55:42] they can believe what they want to
[55:44] what it is it's the devil trying to
[55:46] soften this thing and make you where you
[55:48] think you're and he's going to make you
[55:50] religious but he can't make you a
[55:51] christian
[55:53] amen he can't make you christ-like
[55:55] because he doesn't know how to be
[55:57] christ-like
[55:58] all right how striking now he takes the
[56:00] place where we are to dwell in through
[56:01] the same process now he's called the
[56:03] church
[56:04] through justification called it through
[56:05] sanctification then filled it with the
[56:07] holy ghost and fire and he took it
[56:09] through a process that he himself the
[56:11] holy spirit himself the son of god see
[56:13] the son of god we're still talking about
[56:15] the son of god all right we haven't
[56:17] gotten to the son of man yet son of man
[56:18] is going to pray a little bit further
[56:20] but we're talking about the son of god
[56:21] remember he built his church on the
[56:23] revelation of the son of god so that's
[56:25] what he's saying right here could dwell
[56:26] in the human heart now it has to go
[56:29] through that before
[56:31] he
[56:31] can come
[56:33] into it all right so you've got to go
[56:35] through it
[56:37] before you can come into it right all
[56:39] right
[56:41] because remember it's out of and then
[56:43] two you got to come out and go in all
[56:45] right so it's out of an n2 all right so
[56:47] now let's go to number three get some of
[56:49] these quotes out of the way
[56:52] now there's where the thing comes in
[56:54] paragraph 134
[56:56] of the statue of perfect man we're going
[56:58] to talk about or out of house
[57:00] this foundation is first what is the
[57:03] foundation of christianity amen faith in
[57:06] the word of god glory that's your
[57:08] foundation
[57:09] then you begin to grow
[57:11] then you start you begin to add
[57:14] to this
[57:16] foundation all right
[57:19] now let's go i didn't read these but i
[57:20] want to read these here this go to
[57:22] number four
[57:24] and five
[57:25] and then i'm gonna make a comment and
[57:26] then we will start with virtue now this
[57:28] is questions and answers in 1964
[57:32] all right he talks about but i want to
[57:34] this is what's happening to us right
[57:36] here
[57:37] this first conscious controls this body
[57:39] with sea taste filled smelling here it's
[57:41] just got all scrupled up see you can
[57:43] take your the way he drew the three
[57:45] circles the the the seatays feel smell
[57:48] in here the memories and conscious
[57:49] affection and the inner court that's the
[57:51] same way with outer court inner court
[57:52] holy holies all right same thing
[57:56] it's got all scrupled up we reason and
[57:58] everything else but that new body that
[58:00] comes from this born again right
[58:02] so now you didn't get a new human body
[58:05] when you got born again right amen i
[58:07] wish we had off
[58:09] got a new body when we were born again a
[58:11] human body but we didn't because
[58:14] remember god starts from the inside and
[58:15] works his way out all right but that new
[58:18] body that comes from this born again not
[58:20] this first conscious it'll pass away all
[58:23] right
[58:24] it's that inside something that lives
[58:26] everybody understand it say amen amen
[58:28] congregation replies amen it's not this
[58:31] outside sea tastes field smelling here
[58:33] it isn't it's subject to death and will
[58:35] die but the inside part of you down in
[58:38] here inside that is the person that
[58:40] cannot die
[58:42] now that's the one that's going to start
[58:43] growing up this statue of a perfect man
[58:46] all right because watch what he's saying
[58:47] and that's the person that the new life
[58:50] starts from
[58:52] right from this new birth amen and it
[58:55] builds another person exactly in the
[58:58] image of this person you are
[59:01] around that life you get it so what it
[59:04] starts in the center
[59:06] it starts in the center of you and works
[59:08] its way out
[59:10] and builds another person because you
[59:11] know what you're not the person it's not
[59:13] another person there's not two of you
[59:14] are not schizophrenic
[59:17] because remember it's either faith or
[59:18] doubt right right it's not faith and
[59:20] doubt right faith and doubt would be
[59:22] another person in there and y'all would
[59:24] be fighting but no it's another person
[59:27] what it's going to do it's going to
[59:28] change you
[59:31] amen it's going to change the person you
[59:33] are
[59:34] god and you brother brown said there as
[59:36] persons he vulcanizes his life to you
[59:40] amen amen and then what
[59:43] this is my soul
[59:44] but god gave me his soul right when god
[59:47] given me anything it's now mine
[59:50] now that new birth is mine glory it's
[59:52] mine it's in my soul it's mine and he
[59:54] can't have it back
[59:55] he don't want it back he wants you to
[59:57] try to give it to somebody else amen so
[1:00:00] now watch out we're going to read number
[1:00:01] five and this is what
[1:00:03] i want you to watch what he's saying
[1:00:05] this is chapter nine the layout of
[1:00:07] seeing church age and there's no
[1:00:08] paragraph number so you'll just have to
[1:00:10] look it up if you want to if you want to
[1:00:12] look it up or go online and get this off
[1:00:14] watch this
[1:00:16] take a good night he's in the loudest in
[1:00:18] church age so it's our church ages what
[1:00:20] we're this is where we're living today
[1:00:22] right
[1:00:23] this is where we're living today
[1:00:26] y'all need to wake up i don't know what
[1:00:27] y'all drink this morning but it sure
[1:00:28] wasn't energy juice
[1:00:30] if you sleep now you're going to be
[1:00:31] really sleeping second serving
[1:00:34] take a good look around you
[1:00:36] examine the people as they walk by
[1:00:39] and the multitudes you see can you pick
[1:00:42] out those that have the appearance of
[1:00:45] christians right right
[1:00:47] watch how they dress
[1:00:49] watch how they act hear what they say
[1:00:52] see where they go
[1:00:56] it's like brother luke was talking about
[1:00:57] last night
[1:00:59] you go to a ball game
[1:01:02] this is eternal life and the ball game's
[1:01:04] worthless
[1:01:05] and people jump up and down he said he
[1:01:07] had a song leader i'll tell you about he
[1:01:08] said he had a lot song leader that said
[1:01:10] he wasn't emotional
[1:01:11] well the song leader took him to a
[1:01:13] clemson basketball game
[1:01:19] clemson scored a three-pointer right at
[1:01:20] the end of the game and won by one point
[1:01:22] or got up by one point he said he looked
[1:01:24] over there and that guy was ah
[1:01:27] he said he looked over and he said me
[1:01:28] and you gonna have a problem sandy
[1:01:35] but remember it's what our desire is
[1:01:38] it's what our desire is
[1:01:41] watch how they dress watch how they act
[1:01:43] hear what they say see where they go
[1:01:45] surely there ought to be some real
[1:01:47] evidence of the new birth amongst all
[1:01:49] those we see go by
[1:01:51] but few there be
[1:01:53] yet today the fundamental churches are
[1:01:55] telling us that they have millions saved
[1:01:57] and even
[1:01:58] spirit-filled
[1:02:00] spirit-filled question mark he's asking
[1:02:02] the question
[1:02:03] can you call women and i'm going to say
[1:02:05] he he talks about i'm going to say men
[1:02:07] too
[1:02:08] women's a little more obvious because
[1:02:09] you can see the outward appearance but
[1:02:10] us men the same way can you call women
[1:02:13] spirit-filled that go around with frizzy
[1:02:14] bobbed hairs shorts and slacks halters
[1:02:16] and briefs all painted up like jezebel
[1:02:19] if these are adorned in modest apparel
[1:02:21] as becometh
[1:02:22] christian women i would hate to think
[1:02:25] what it would be like if i had to
[1:02:26] witness a display of immodesty yeah all
[1:02:29] right so i'm saying the same thing with
[1:02:30] the men the men i mean what is it what
[1:02:33] we'll scroll it back down scroll back
[1:02:35] down to the to the top
[1:02:38] watch what they watch how they dress
[1:02:40] watch how they act hear what they say
[1:02:43] i'll guarantee you if you'll just be
[1:02:45] quiet and listen long enough
[1:02:48] people will tell you where they are amen
[1:02:51] hear what they say
[1:02:53] see where they go yeah surely they ought
[1:02:56] to be some real evidence of the new
[1:02:58] mirth amongst all those we see
[1:03:00] go by but listen
[1:03:02] just as the denominational world has
[1:03:05] eroded the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:08] saying it's just shake a hand or come to
[1:03:10] church or be good or whatever you know
[1:03:12] be no be halfway good
[1:03:14] all right
[1:03:16] but they've done the same thing in the
[1:03:17] message they've eroded the life of the
[1:03:20] new birth
[1:03:22] and they're teaching the people that
[1:03:23] well you just got to believe the message
[1:03:25] well the devil believes the message so
[1:03:27] he's part he's in the he's in the he's
[1:03:29] in there in line to get just what we got
[1:03:31] no he's not
[1:03:32] he's not in my inner court right right
[1:03:37] he's not in my holy of holies now he may
[1:03:39] be in that outer court but he's not in
[1:03:40] that holy of holies
[1:03:42] if he is then you're not born again
[1:03:44] all right so now look but that's a good
[1:03:47] one they take a look around
[1:03:50] examine the people and the multitudes
[1:03:52] you see can you pick out those that have
[1:03:54] the appearance of christians sure we can
[1:03:56] see the appearance of religion
[1:03:59] but we can't can we see the appearance
[1:04:01] of christians
[1:04:03] you know you you go into places and you
[1:04:05] see a uh you have to look at the whole
[1:04:07] thing because you see a you see a woman
[1:04:09] walk by and her hair's real long but
[1:04:12] then when she turns around she's got
[1:04:13] earrings in
[1:04:14] you know i mean the whole picture
[1:04:15] doesn't go together now
[1:04:17] some will some will have long hair just
[1:04:19] because they like it
[1:04:20] and some some ladies like to wear
[1:04:22] dresses
[1:04:24] and obviously some of them wear half
[1:04:26] dresses
[1:04:27] or third dresses
[1:04:29] i don't see how worlds you can pay 20
[1:04:31] something dollars for one of them things
[1:04:32] that they show on them racks that that
[1:04:34] ain't got enough material that this 8x11
[1:04:36] piece of paper's got
[1:04:38] so
[1:04:39] but that shows but they're showing what
[1:04:41] they are inside
[1:04:43] and you got to do the same thing you got
[1:04:45] to show what you are
[1:04:47] but it's going to come from the inside
[1:04:49] now brother brown talks about being mate
[1:04:51] believers and he talks about in a statue
[1:04:53] of a perfect man he talks about
[1:04:55] the black birds sticking peacock
[1:04:57] feathers in it'll work for a little
[1:04:59] while
[1:05:00] but all of a sudden
[1:05:02] those peacock feathers fall off
[1:05:04] and you make the mistake
[1:05:06] of
[1:05:07] showing the crow again that's what we
[1:05:10] want to do but we want to drive that
[1:05:11] crow out
[1:05:13] and we want to make sure that we're a
[1:05:15] peacock or a dove and that dove
[1:05:18] is going to be right there at the bottom
[1:05:20] called
[1:05:21] faith all right pull the chart back up
[1:05:23] just one more time
[1:05:27] so we got justification sanctification
[1:05:30] faith which is a new birth in the holy
[1:05:32] ghost all that right that's your that's
[1:05:34] your holy of holies that is the divine
[1:05:37] that puts you in line for the divine
[1:05:39] nature of god
[1:05:40] you're a son and daughter of god and
[1:05:42] you're ready to receive
[1:05:45] these virtues
[1:05:47] into your life
[1:05:51] and you have a portion of them
[1:05:54] you would have a portion of virtue
[1:05:56] because
[1:05:57] once you get born again
[1:05:59] obviously people
[1:06:02] are attracted to you yeah
[1:06:05] that are christians
[1:06:07] remember i think we read the quote the
[1:06:08] other day about brother brown he said he
[1:06:10] well see he could feel the vibration he
[1:06:12] could not he'd know he he felt that
[1:06:14] spirit and you know what it gives off a
[1:06:16] different vibration
[1:06:17] it must because brother adam will walk
[1:06:18] up and he'd take somebody by the hand he
[1:06:20] said i see you're a christian
[1:06:23] well he wasn't looking at outside
[1:06:24] appearance right right he said he said
[1:06:26] because our spirit is common our spirit
[1:06:30] is welcome he'd always say your spirit
[1:06:32] is welcome now he would tell some of him
[1:06:34] he never said a word to him he said you
[1:06:36] need to repent you need to get right and
[1:06:37] you need to get born again well you know
[1:06:39] what that was there was a different
[1:06:41] spirit there a different vibration
[1:06:44] coming off of that person so that's the
[1:06:46] same way with you and i once you get in
[1:06:47] that holy of holies listen if you're
[1:06:49] born again and i'm born again just like
[1:06:51] i read you the quote last sunday
[1:06:54] it don't make you act different
[1:06:56] basically different than i do
[1:07:00] now if my holy ghost says i need to be
[1:07:02] here and listen to the word of god and
[1:07:03] listen to the pastors prophets teachers
[1:07:05] evangelists and all those things then
[1:07:07] yours should do the same thing
[1:07:09] that's why it's really it's really hard
[1:07:12] to get people to see that they don't
[1:07:14] have the new birth
[1:07:16] they just have a religious experience
[1:07:23] now i'm telling you i got the new birth
[1:07:26] all right you're not going to talk me
[1:07:28] out of it
[1:07:30] but i'm not going to stay away from
[1:07:31] church
[1:07:33] i thought it drove you to church
[1:07:36] i didn't think it drove you away from it
[1:07:38] now it's your own stinking ideas that
[1:07:40] take you away from it
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] but add two all right let's i'm gonna
[1:07:46] read this don't bring it because i've
[1:07:47] already got it but ii peter 1 says add
[1:07:50] to your faith
[1:07:53] add to your faith
[1:07:54] virtue so it's your faith
[1:07:57] this morning
[1:07:58] you got to know whether it's your faith
[1:08:01] or you're either believing unto which
[1:08:03] you can
[1:08:05] because remember let me give you an
[1:08:06] example you say well i got to be born
[1:08:07] again to start getting these that's
[1:08:09] exactly the truth but
[1:08:11] remember the disciples
[1:08:13] they held the word that they had and
[1:08:15] they weren't born again
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:18] they held the word that jesus spoke
[1:08:21] didn't understand it right obviously
[1:08:24] didn't live it peter was still wanting
[1:08:26] to cut people's ears off and curse and
[1:08:28] all these other things but once he come
[1:08:30] up to that day of pentecost all that
[1:08:33] word that had been piled into him
[1:08:35] come to life
[1:08:37] amen and he had virtue and knowledge but
[1:08:39] he was still growing in god
[1:08:42] he was still growing in god but you can
[1:08:44] have my brother adam said you can have a
[1:08:45] portion of these virtues but you can't
[1:08:47] have god virtue
[1:08:51] you can't have god virtue and not be
[1:08:53] born again
[1:08:54] right you can have a part of virtue but
[1:08:56] now we're going to talk about virtue now
[1:08:59] but remember i want you to see this when
[1:09:01] we read that scripture
[1:09:03] i want you
[1:09:05] peter says add to your faith
[1:09:08] virtue now let's put this to the word
[1:09:10] and let's read between the lines
[1:09:13] add to what you believe
[1:09:16] virtue
[1:09:19] because it is what you right after your
[1:09:21] faith in faith believing so add to what
[1:09:23] you believe
[1:09:25] so it's got to be based on what you
[1:09:27] believe
[1:09:28] add to what you believe
[1:09:31] virtue so let's go to virtue
[1:09:33] and it's got to be according to the word
[1:09:36] it's got to be according to what the
[1:09:37] scripture says but it's all based on
[1:09:42] faith
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:45] it's not seen but it can be shown right
[1:09:48] if i get these virtues it can't be seen
[1:09:51] even the new birth can't be seen exactly
[1:09:53] but it can be shown right all right it's
[1:09:56] going to be shown you're going you're
[1:09:57] going to in this age of manifestation
[1:09:59] we're going to manifest who we are
[1:10:02] whether we want to or not
[1:10:03] all right
[1:10:05] but it's all got to be based on based on
[1:10:08] this right here we never leave that
[1:10:10] foundation
[1:10:12] of faith you say oh you just read where
[1:10:13] it says leaving the foundation
[1:10:17] well you know what we're not going to
[1:10:18] leave this foundation of faith what
[1:10:20] we're going to do is we're going to
[1:10:21] carry it with us
[1:10:23] amen we're going to carry it with us
[1:10:24] because look the character
[1:10:27] or the are the
[1:10:29] um the construction of this building
[1:10:32] gary brother gary depends on the
[1:10:33] foundation right right
[1:10:36] the structural integrity of this
[1:10:38] building
[1:10:39] still determines whether that
[1:10:40] foundation's good underneath us or not
[1:10:42] right because if you don't you see
[1:10:44] cracks
[1:10:45] you'll have leakage you'll have
[1:10:48] you see what i'm saying same way with
[1:10:49] you if that foundation's not right and
[1:10:51] you take that foundation all the way up
[1:10:53] through the walls and into the top
[1:10:56] you're gonna crack somewhere all right
[1:10:58] so you got to have that good foundation
[1:11:00] all based on
[1:11:02] faith all right now we're going to go to
[1:11:06] virtue
[1:11:07] now this virtue right here
[1:11:09] is
[1:11:10] obviously if we're born again we should
[1:11:13] be living a virtuous life anyway
[1:11:18] true so this must mean just a little bit
[1:11:20] right more
[1:11:22] than just living a virtuous life because
[1:11:24] if you're born again you are the
[1:11:25] virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ
[1:11:27] so you already are virtuous
[1:11:30] but do you have this godly virtue as the
[1:11:33] prophet brought
[1:11:35] i believe we have to have it and that's
[1:11:38] probably
[1:11:39] where
[1:11:40] we
[1:11:41] don't understand
[1:11:43] what this virtue is all right because i
[1:11:45] want to brother branham i'll let him
[1:11:47] tell you what it is and then we're going
[1:11:49] to talk about it let's go to quote
[1:11:50] number six
[1:11:52] but remember this is all based on what
[1:11:55] faith right
[1:11:57] add to your faith what's what's this
[1:11:59] right here
[1:12:01] number six paragraph 141 now here is
[1:12:03] what we do what's the first thing have
[1:12:05] faith and be born again that's laying
[1:12:06] the foundation then after we lay the
[1:12:09] foundation secondly you add to your
[1:12:11] foundation
[1:12:13] add to your faith in other words add to
[1:12:15] what you believe you gotta you gotta add
[1:12:17] to what you believe right
[1:12:18] gotta start somewhere you gotta believe
[1:12:20] okay believe that he is what god and a
[1:12:23] rewarder what is his reward
[1:12:28] that's his reward his reward is giving
[1:12:30] you the virtues that he has
[1:12:33] first you have faith
[1:12:35] then you add virtue to your faith now
[1:12:38] this is what the lord showed me i want
[1:12:39] you to try to get
[1:12:41] try to get involved with this because
[1:12:43] look
[1:12:44] if you never leave the foundation of
[1:12:46] faith
[1:12:47] and we're going to talk about virtue
[1:12:49] because virtue is what obviously we
[1:12:50] mostly we know what it is it's strength
[1:12:54] okay
[1:12:55] it's strength
[1:12:56] all right
[1:12:57] it's strength and what you believe but
[1:13:01] we don't need to just have virtue and
[1:13:03] not just have faith
[1:13:05] we must have virtue faith
[1:13:10] i know you're not getting it it'll take
[1:13:12] a little while
[1:13:13] but you must have ver if you add verse
[1:13:15] you you add to your faith virtue you
[1:13:18] must now have virtue faith
[1:13:20] which is not just faith because faith
[1:13:22] alone won't do it
[1:13:23] you got to have strong faith
[1:13:26] amen so you see how we're going to add
[1:13:28] all these right here he put it on there
[1:13:30] i wanted to put on it now we have to
[1:13:31] have virtue faith
[1:13:34] we never leave the foundation of faith
[1:13:36] but now we must have virtue faith
[1:13:39] all right so let's go to mark
[1:13:42] and let's look at an example
[1:13:44] mark 5
[1:13:47] verse 30.
[1:13:50] and here's one of the times that virtue
[1:13:52] is used and jesus immediately knowing
[1:13:54] himself that virtue had gone out of him
[1:13:57] turned him around in the press and said
[1:14:00] who touched
[1:14:01] my clothes
[1:14:03] all right so we know that and we're
[1:14:04] going to read another one in a little
[1:14:05] while but not right this second
[1:14:08] i want you to look here
[1:14:10] now many times i think brother ernie
[1:14:12] preached on this one time but not at
[1:14:13] virtue he preached on dunamis
[1:14:16] you must have power right
[1:14:19] you must have power power is dunamis if
[1:14:21] you look that word up
[1:14:23] you know it says right here in the thing
[1:14:25] it says to click on all the
[1:14:27] all the scriptures that this is
[1:14:28] pertaining to it's mostly power
[1:14:31] might strength and miracles yeah
[1:14:35] it's what that word virtue means all
[1:14:37] right so power
[1:14:40] jesus christ had to have the power
[1:14:42] before that power because remember if
[1:14:44] you have power and then something's
[1:14:46] drawn like you you plug in a
[1:14:48] you have a little generator running like
[1:14:49] we did now at the hunting camp you keep
[1:14:51] plugging stuff in what's that generator
[1:14:52] going to do it's going to go weaker and
[1:14:54] we cause what you're pulling strength
[1:14:57] out of that generator all right same way
[1:15:00] with a power grid if you take and take
[1:15:02] that's what happened in new york they
[1:15:04] they burst that power grid because
[1:15:06] people were drawing so much power out of
[1:15:08] it well there had to be power there to
[1:15:10] draw from now god's power never gets
[1:15:12] weak so we're going to have to worry
[1:15:14] about pulling too much power from god
[1:15:16] all right you go don't say well i think
[1:15:18] i'll just well i'm not going to pray for
[1:15:19] that brother because i may not god may
[1:15:21] not forget it that's silly
[1:15:24] but dunamis is power
[1:15:27] mighty work strength
[1:15:29] miracle might virtue might strength
[1:15:32] power and ability but watch this it's
[1:15:34] inherent power
[1:15:39] you inherit it right
[1:15:41] if you get born again you inherit virtue
[1:15:44] inherent power power residing in a thing
[1:15:48] by virtue of what
[1:15:50] it's nature
[1:15:52] now what do we get the divine nature of
[1:15:55] god
[1:15:56] so in the divine nature of god lays
[1:15:58] virtue
[1:16:00] power residing in a thing by virtue of
[1:16:02] its nature or which a person or thing
[1:16:04] exerts and puts forth power for
[1:16:08] performing miracles right
[1:16:10] moral power and excellence of soul
[1:16:13] so even the even the greek scholars
[1:16:15] realize that it had to start in that
[1:16:17] soul
[1:16:19] and work its way out but look inherent
[1:16:21] power
[1:16:23] power strength so in other words we got
[1:16:26] to have not just faith we got to have a
[1:16:27] strong faith
[1:16:29] we got to have a powerful faith we got
[1:16:31] to have something that somebody can draw
[1:16:33] from
[1:16:36] we don't have it you can't draw from it
[1:16:38] brother brown makes the example and
[1:16:40] we're not going to read it but let's go
[1:16:42] to acts 1 8. this is one of the first
[1:16:44] ones it comes to is right here that same
[1:16:47] virtue that left jesus when the lady
[1:16:50] touched his garment
[1:16:51] is the same word right here for that
[1:16:53] word power right it takes you right to
[1:16:55] that acts 1 verse 8 but you shall
[1:16:57] receive power after
[1:17:01] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[1:17:03] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[1:17:05] in jerusalem and judea and samaria and
[1:17:07] utter most parts of the earth remember
[1:17:08] this is jesus before he ascends
[1:17:10] you shall receive power
[1:17:13] so now we're looking at
[1:17:14] virtue faith
[1:17:16] we're looking at the faith that we have
[1:17:18] with power added to it amen amen
[1:17:21] we're looking at the power and strength
[1:17:24] that god gives us through what word of
[1:17:26] god
[1:17:27] amen now this is one i really like go to
[1:17:30] acts 3.
[1:17:31] you've heard me mention this before but
[1:17:33] we're going to read it
[1:17:34] a certain man lame from his mother's
[1:17:35] womb was carried whom they laid daily at
[1:17:38] the gate of the temple which is called
[1:17:39] beautiful
[1:17:41] now look
[1:17:42] hundreds of thousands of people have
[1:17:44] walked by
[1:17:45] that man
[1:17:46] for years
[1:17:49] walked by that man
[1:17:51] never able to help him
[1:17:53] just like the woman that had the blood
[1:17:54] issue she went to all the doctors like
[1:17:56] brother brown gives the illustration she
[1:17:58] spends all of her money on physicians
[1:17:59] nobody was able to help her
[1:18:02] by the gate which is called beautiful
[1:18:03] last alms of them that entered into the
[1:18:05] temple
[1:18:06] who's seeing peter and john about to go
[1:18:08] in the temple
[1:18:10] they were going to church
[1:18:14] dear jesus i can't believe some of you
[1:18:15] people don't come back second service
[1:18:17] i'm sorry but that just gets it just
[1:18:18] burns my britches
[1:18:21] burns gods too but you know what
[1:18:23] i can't answer for you we need all the
[1:18:26] help we can get i don't care who we are
[1:18:29] and peter
[1:18:31] fastening his eyes upon him with john
[1:18:33] said look on us
[1:18:35] look on us
[1:18:38] and that man probably looked at peter
[1:18:40] and he probably been fishing that day he
[1:18:42] didn't see a lot
[1:18:46] and see
[1:18:47] see
[1:18:48] a lot but he was fixing to understand
[1:18:50] yeah and peter fastening his eyes upon
[1:18:53] him with john and said look on us
[1:18:56] and he gave heed unto them expecting to
[1:18:58] receive some money
[1:19:03] can i is that changing the word no
[1:19:05] because that's what he was expecting
[1:19:06] because he sure didn't see anything
[1:19:08] outwardly that he was going to get okay
[1:19:10] but people had been giving him money
[1:19:12] because peter said look look on us and
[1:19:15] he gave heathen expecting to receive
[1:19:17] something of them
[1:19:19] then peter and said peter said
[1:19:22] silver and gold have i none now see he
[1:19:24] would have been lying if he had money in
[1:19:26] his pocket
[1:19:28] he had nothing
[1:19:30] peter said silver and gold have i none
[1:19:33] but such as i have that's right
[1:19:37] he had virtue faith
[1:19:40] because remember that guy didn't have no
[1:19:41] faith
[1:19:43] he was asking for money
[1:19:45] he wasn't even asking for healing amen
[1:19:48] was he asking for healing no he was
[1:19:49] asking for money right all right
[1:19:52] so peter said silver and gold have i
[1:19:54] none but such as i have
[1:19:56] give i thee in the name of jesus christ
[1:19:59] of nazareth rise up and walk
[1:20:04] and the guy just didn't jump straight up
[1:20:07] he took him by the right hand and lifted
[1:20:09] him up and immediately his feet and
[1:20:10] ankle bones received virtue
[1:20:15] virtuous strength
[1:20:17] but it had to be in peter before he
[1:20:19] could give it out
[1:20:21] peter didn't have to go pray for it and
[1:20:23] and i think sister johnny uh the other
[1:20:25] day for uh she gave me a video or a
[1:20:28] video of it was called a.d which was
[1:20:30] after jesus's death i can't remember
[1:20:32] what that means in in latin but
[1:20:35] it's after it's
[1:20:36] talking of the disciples and it shows
[1:20:38] peter and june and i were watching it
[1:20:40] and i said look at his face
[1:20:42] but peter peter said silver and gold
[1:20:44] have i known you the actor was saying
[1:20:45] silver and gold have i none but such as
[1:20:47] i have i give unto thee rise up and walk
[1:20:49] well when the guy gets up peter's like
[1:20:53] he's a little bit shocked himself
[1:20:56] and i think maybe peter might have been
[1:20:58] just a little bit shocked himself
[1:21:00] but he had the resilience in his heart
[1:21:03] that that he'd never said it if he knew
[1:21:04] that man wasn't going to get up right
[1:21:06] all right silver and gold have i none
[1:21:07] but such as i have now see to me
[1:21:10] that's beginning to give us power with
[1:21:13] character
[1:21:14] remember power without character is
[1:21:16] satanic but power with character the
[1:21:19] very first thing besides our faith god
[1:21:22] is giving us power
[1:21:24] he's given us the strength to make it
[1:21:27] through because you know what's gonna be
[1:21:28] a hard journey
[1:21:31] it's not a picnic
[1:21:32] it's not forks and spoons
[1:21:35] it's swords and shields helmets
[1:21:39] you gotta fight your way to heaven
[1:21:41] amen
[1:21:42] you got to fight your way to heaven
[1:21:44] this is not a flowery bed of ease
[1:21:47] but to have virtue faith
[1:21:50] is what you and i need to have
[1:21:52] all right
[1:21:54] let's go to first corinthians
[1:21:57] 4 and 20.
[1:21:58] here's another one this one takes you
[1:22:00] right back to that same when jesus said
[1:22:02] virtue left him
[1:22:04] power or strength this is the next one
[1:22:05] that comes up first corinthians 4 20
[1:22:07] says for the kingdom of god is not in
[1:22:10] word that's a little bit of the word
[1:22:11] that's not big word
[1:22:13] that's a little that's in the letter of
[1:22:15] the word okay so don't get it wrong is
[1:22:18] that saying well he's not in the word
[1:22:20] he's not in the letter of the word
[1:22:23] he's not in just the written part okay
[1:22:26] but in power
[1:22:28] all right because look power without
[1:22:31] character that's where brother branham
[1:22:32] got that i believe power without
[1:22:33] character is satanic he's beginning
[1:22:35] god's starting right there at virtue now
[1:22:39] an example of all of us would be brother
[1:22:41] dale
[1:22:43] or or a minister or a deacon or somebody
[1:22:46] that you that you want to pray for you
[1:22:48] why do you want them to pray for you
[1:22:51] your holy ghost is discerning that they
[1:22:53] have virtue or strength maybe more than
[1:22:56] you got at that moment
[1:22:59] let's just be honest maybe more than you
[1:23:00] got at that moment
[1:23:02] you're going to somebody in your ass and
[1:23:04] said hey pray for me and what you're
[1:23:06] saying is pray for me that the strength
[1:23:08] that you have will come on me
[1:23:11] amen that's what we do and we we rely on
[1:23:14] brother dale that's why i listen
[1:23:15] pastorship is is very
[1:23:19] expensive
[1:23:22] not monetarily
[1:23:24] it's very expensive
[1:23:26] it wears you out
[1:23:28] it takes from your body why jesus
[1:23:30] looking 50 years old and he was only 30.
[1:23:33] what brother brown said the toils of his
[1:23:35] ministry look at brother branham he died
[1:23:36] at 56 years old you know i'll be 55 next
[1:23:39] monday i won't be far from where where
[1:23:41] he's at
[1:23:42] and but look at him deep set eyes you
[1:23:44] look at his hands on some of those
[1:23:46] pictures he looks like about a 60 year
[1:23:47] old man why
[1:23:50] the toils the strength think of the
[1:23:52] think of the power
[1:23:54] brother branham said oh i said look at
[1:23:55] jesus got weak he said look at me a
[1:23:57] center saved by grace and he'll go
[1:23:59] through the prayer line and maybe 10 or
[1:24:01] 15 people and they have to carry him off
[1:24:02] what was it it was the virtue that was
[1:24:04] flowing out of that man
[1:24:06] it was the power that the man had given
[1:24:09] to him by god by a gift you say well
[1:24:12] that was a gift of healing that's fine
[1:24:14] but you and i get the same gift right
[1:24:16] not at that level right there was only
[1:24:18] one
[1:24:19] there was only one part of that healing
[1:24:21] campaign where brother randall could do
[1:24:23] that what he did amen
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:26] okay so we're not trying to be that
[1:24:28] anymore but where did that all go away
[1:24:32] it didn't
[1:24:34] we just got to believe that that power
[1:24:36] is still here it's just in a
[1:24:37] many-membered body that we can all pray
[1:24:40] for the sick that we can all
[1:24:42] you know it's what i was last weekend i
[1:24:44] was thinking when i was laying those
[1:24:45] prayer cloths on there and and y'all
[1:24:47] were taking them home i thought god let
[1:24:49] that be power not from me but from the
[1:24:51] word of god let that power of the word
[1:24:53] and acts 19. you say well it's not
[1:24:55] working for me go back and put acts 19
[1:24:58] on top of you remind the devil where
[1:25:00] it's at
[1:25:01] exactly
[1:25:03] because the devil's in here is the one
[1:25:05] that's trying to get you to get away
[1:25:06] from it so you don't have to call him
[1:25:08] anywhere he's right there
[1:25:10] but just remind him and that's what
[1:25:11] peter was saying look silver and gold
[1:25:13] have i none
[1:25:14] but such as i have i'll give to you
[1:25:17] if you'll believe rise up and walk for
[1:25:19] the kingdom of god is not word
[1:25:22] it's not in word
[1:25:24] but
[1:25:25] in power that's right
[1:25:27] all right
[1:25:29] so that's where our
[1:25:31] i want you to look at this one let's go
[1:25:32] to matthew six this one was shocking
[1:25:35] kinda
[1:25:36] but the same that same word power is the
[1:25:39] same word jesus used when he said verse
[1:25:41] you had went from me
[1:25:43] all right watch this and lead us not
[1:25:45] into temptation you know what this is
[1:25:47] and delivers for but delivers from evil
[1:25:49] for thine is the kingdom
[1:25:51] and the power right
[1:25:53] the virtue
[1:25:54] and the glory forever
[1:25:56] amen
[1:25:58] the virtues listen we must have virtue
[1:26:02] faith
[1:26:04] not just virtue virtue of strength we
[1:26:06] must have a powerful faith
[1:26:09] or a strong
[1:26:10] faith and where does it come from it
[1:26:12] comes from the word of god it comes from
[1:26:15] teaching and it comes from reading your
[1:26:17] bible and it comes from studying
[1:26:19] um
[1:26:20] you know many times we
[1:26:22] we go through the week and sometimes and
[1:26:24] i know life gets tough and i know so and
[1:26:27] it's happened to me uh you know i don't
[1:26:29] i try every morning because i don't have
[1:26:30] to go to work till about 7 30 which is
[1:26:32] early for a lot of you but it's late for
[1:26:34] me but uh i get up at 5 30 every morning
[1:26:37] you know what i check my emails and i'll
[1:26:39] check the weather and i'll you know
[1:26:40] check certain things and i'll sit down
[1:26:42] though and read several verses of
[1:26:44] scripture and some days like on saturday
[1:26:47] when i sleep a little bit later and i
[1:26:49] don't do that i miss it
[1:26:51] you should miss reading the word of god
[1:26:54] some of us miss reading what put it xyz
[1:26:57] you should miss reading the word of god
[1:26:59] you should miss because that's where
[1:27:01] your power is going to come from you've
[1:27:04] got to believe number one that god is
[1:27:07] right and then that god sent a five full
[1:27:09] ministry to you
[1:27:13] not sister gwen but brother joe brother
[1:27:15] joe's got to believe he's sending to
[1:27:16] brother joe right you got to believe
[1:27:18] that he sent it for you
[1:27:20] and when you walk in here and you sit
[1:27:22] down
[1:27:23] you draw from what
[1:27:25] the power right amen
[1:27:28] but it's your faith it's the power that
[1:27:30] you add to your faith
[1:27:32] it's power faith or virtue faith so
[1:27:35] that's what really the lord showed me
[1:27:37] because we're going to go through all
[1:27:38] these and we're going to have knowledge
[1:27:39] faith
[1:27:41] we're going to have temperance faith
[1:27:43] godliness faith because what is it it's
[1:27:45] all based on faith you don't leave faith
[1:27:48] down here you just carry faith right on
[1:27:50] up here because you know what that woman
[1:27:52] had faith
[1:27:55] and it connected with the power
[1:27:58] that jesus had right so you can have
[1:28:00] faith today but not have enough power to
[1:28:02] get over that healing i mean to get over
[1:28:04] that sickness or whatever we always lean
[1:28:07] on healing i like healing of the soul
[1:28:09] also glory healing of the soul to me is
[1:28:11] a lot better than healing of the body
[1:28:13] you can be healed of a heart attack or a
[1:28:15] heart condition and die of a heart
[1:28:16] attack tomorrow and still it was god
[1:28:18] that healed you but you can't get born
[1:28:21] again and then tomorrow need to get born
[1:28:22] again again right all right so
[1:28:25] the the healing of the soul
[1:28:28] is what we need to be speaking of
[1:28:30] but virtue faith something strength
[1:28:34] added to your faith amen all right so we
[1:28:37] must have virtue
[1:28:39] faith all right let's let's go to quote
[1:28:42] number seven
[1:28:44] and we'll stop right here
[1:28:46] and then we'll back up build background
[1:28:48] virtue a little bit and we'll start on
[1:28:49] knowledge
[1:28:50] we're gonna start going through these
[1:28:54] and watch this statue of a perfect man
[1:28:56] 1962
[1:28:57] paragraph 144 and the bible says we read
[1:29:00] over here in the book of luke it says
[1:29:01] virtue went out of him that right
[1:29:03] congregation says amen
[1:29:05] if we're going to be like him right we
[1:29:07] must have virtue then
[1:29:12] i mean who doesn't want to be like jesus
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:15] we must have it
[1:29:17] to be like him
[1:29:19] to be like him we got to have it right
[1:29:22] and then we must have it to be like him
[1:29:24] it's the first song i ever loved in the
[1:29:26] hymns one of the greatest was to be like
[1:29:28] jesus
[1:29:29] well if i'm going to be like jesus i've
[1:29:32] got to have virtue right he didn't stop
[1:29:35] there
[1:29:36] and a path
[1:29:38] that it can pass forward from me to the
[1:29:41] people
[1:29:44] god gives you faith
[1:29:46] at the new birth
[1:29:48] then he gives you virtue faith that you
[1:29:51] can give it to other people
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:56] give it away greatest thing in the world
[1:29:58] and you give it want to give it away
[1:30:03] virtue because virtue went out of hymn
[1:30:05] to the people verse you and before you
[1:30:07] can let it out
[1:30:08] you've got to have it first
[1:30:11] you haven't got it it won't come out
[1:30:13] there's nothing for it to come out of
[1:30:16] what if someone tried to draw virtue out
[1:30:19] of us and check would return
[1:30:20] insufficient funds see no no
[1:30:23] none there to draw from check bounce
[1:30:25] somebody looked at you as a christian
[1:30:27] and tomorrow see you out here carrying
[1:30:30] on like a sinner not much virtue can be
[1:30:33] drawn from that see right
[1:30:35] virtue
[1:30:37] must
[1:30:38] must
[1:30:39] be in us
[1:30:40] and until we get virtue then when we get
[1:30:43] true virtue
[1:30:45] virtue faith
[1:30:46] we can add it to our faith that's the
[1:30:49] next foundation wall now first you must
[1:30:51] have faith
[1:30:52] faith alone won't do it right
[1:30:55] faith alone won't do it
[1:30:58] faith alone will get you born again
[1:30:59] faith will only get you in the body of
[1:31:00] christ faith alone will get you get you
[1:31:02] into into the holy of holies with god
[1:31:04] but he doesn't want you to stay that way
[1:31:06] right
[1:31:07] faith won't do it you've got peter said
[1:31:09] then add virtue to your faith you must
[1:31:11] have virtue in order to add it
[1:31:15] to your faith
[1:31:16] now then it might be the reason you
[1:31:18] don't have it it's because many churches
[1:31:19] a day teaches you don't have to have it
[1:31:21] same way in the message or the days of
[1:31:24] or the days of it has passed they don't
[1:31:26] have to have it the only thing you have
[1:31:27] to do is just join a church yeah days is
[1:31:29] past virtue anyone knows what the word
[1:31:31] virtue means see and we must have it if
[1:31:34] virtue went from him to heal the woman
[1:31:36] that was sick he's expecting the same
[1:31:39] virtue in his church amen
[1:31:41] because he was our example and if he had
[1:31:43] virtue to give to the people he expects
[1:31:46] us to have virtue to give to the people
[1:31:48] and what his virtue virtue is strength
[1:31:52] and power amen amen
[1:31:54] everybody got that we must have let's
[1:31:56] stand virtue faith
[1:31:59] we must have strength how do you get
[1:32:01] strength from the word of god
[1:32:04] doing what god said
[1:32:06] will
[1:32:07] give you
[1:32:08] strength or virtue
[1:32:12] so see i i want you to look sure virtue
[1:32:14] is a virtuous person it's a
[1:32:16] you know it's something you do
[1:32:18] that uh
[1:32:19] that gives you uh
[1:32:21] um you know favor with the people but
[1:32:23] still that favor with the people
[1:32:26] has got to have a way to get out right
[1:32:29] amen so i say about about pastors
[1:32:31] pastors must have so much strength and
[1:32:33] virtue that you know what you're pulling
[1:32:37] every sunday and every wednesday you're
[1:32:39] pulling
[1:32:40] from the gift of god glory and that gift
[1:32:42] of god is a vessel right but you know
[1:32:45] what too you can draw it from the word
[1:32:47] of god yourself
[1:32:48] you can draw that strength from the word
[1:32:49] of god
[1:32:50] but you got to remember the ethiopian
[1:32:52] eunuch
[1:32:54] he was drawing from the word
[1:32:57] but he didn't have it lined up
[1:32:59] see
[1:33:00] remember he said is this man talking of
[1:33:01] a self or of another well somebody that
[1:33:03] had the new birth had to come philip had
[1:33:05] to come and put the word together for
[1:33:08] him and what was the first thing the
[1:33:09] ethiopian unit said where's water
[1:33:11] yeah where's water i got some strength
[1:33:14] now i got some strength in this that i'm
[1:33:16] reading where's the water right hey man
[1:33:18] so the problem with us all is is number
[1:33:21] one we must have the new birth number
[1:33:24] two we must have virtue faith to be able
[1:33:26] to give it out to other people or even
[1:33:29] to have strength for you to make it
[1:33:31] through life right
[1:33:32] but remember like brother brown said god
[1:33:34] doesn't want you to keep it he wants an
[1:33:36] outlet amen an outlet where he can give
[1:33:39] virtue
[1:33:40] from somebody to another person
[1:33:43] because we're all weak
[1:33:45] in certain areas and we need faith or
[1:33:47] strength to bring us back up go ahead
[1:33:51] number 67 to be like jesus
[1:33:56] be like jesus
[1:33:59] if you have a knee today
[1:34:16] a
[1:34:21] from earth
[1:34:23] to glory
[1:34:27] i only am
[1:34:44] you know we all
[1:34:46] want to be like our earthly parents to a
[1:34:48] degree
