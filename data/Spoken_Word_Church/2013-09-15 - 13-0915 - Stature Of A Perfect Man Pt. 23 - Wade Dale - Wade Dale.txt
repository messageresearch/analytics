13-0915 - Stature Of A Perfect Man Pt. 23 - Wade Dale
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're talking on the statute of a perfect man right we've got to Virtue we spent 20 classes on faith and the foundation so we're going to start last week we went and U dealt a little with virtue but let's let's look at it again the definition of virtue definition of virtue is Conformity to a standard of right or particular moral Excellence it's an order of angels quality or power of a thing all right you just keep going come on in manly strength or courage a commendable quality of trait a capacity to act and then Chastity especially in a woman now brother B said virtue this virtue in the pyramid was not virgin living amen why you should have done that at Faith right at the new birth should have took away with all that you should have virtue when you begin to or live a virtuous life when you become a Christian all right so that virtue is not talking about being a virgin all right or being a chase like Chastity especially in a woman but we know through the prophet's message that it was power or strength virtue is strength and then some of you like Sister Lisa it's a character and it's something that it's something that you have to deal with yourself all these virtues sure it has to be shown to other people but like my example with Peter Peter didn't have to get virtue real quick at the gate beautiful he already had it amen and he knew he had that's right or he wouldn't stop he wouldn't give it to that person Silver and Gold Have I night in other words like I said there's no way I mean here you and now what we do today is we see somebody down and out and can't pay the hospital bills what the first thing we do we go okay we'll we'll give you some some money get way we'll give you some money here and go fix your problem but Peter walks up and doesn't even have a billfall doesn't have a check in account he doesn't have a credit card so what is he telling the what is he telling the the the man he said look man I can't even afford to pay my bills much l yours so and Gold Have I None it's what he was saying monetary amount I don't have but such as I have not such as I'm going to get such as I have give I un thee cuz there's no way Peter could have put it in the Eternal Word of God to add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temper unless he had it himself already that's right right so that's what you and I got to realize first you and I got to realize that that virtue and strength comes from you oh yes it's the Holy Ghost working in you but that ver has to be a birth it has to be something a birth means to come forth right being born again who said that Peter so he ought to know that these things are being birthed in you as you go through your Christian journey and we get a little bit of each one it's not that we get full of virtue and then it's like a cup it fills up and then it runs over into knowledge and then knowledge fills up and it runs no it's it's like I told him brother Tim I don't like those lines in the pyramid they're just for illust ation purposes right really I believe they need to turn them this way you got to have faith all the way up you got to have virtue all the way up you got to have knowledge all the way up you got to have Temperance all the way up bti and godliness all the way up the pyramid not that you stop and say well I'm full of virtue I don't need anymore no you'll be a virtuous person till the day you get out of here that's right right and same thing with knowledge Temperance patience and all the way up so let's read what brother rham said about this in the angel of the Lord you can read it here on the screen can y'all see that in the back box can you see that okay the woman that touched to him of His Garment got the blessing that she asked for he felt virtue go out so he had to have it yeah he had to have it for it to go out all right but when them men that know he was a prophet there a woman went the well knew he was a prophet put a rag around his head and hit him on the head with a reed and said now if you're a prophet tell us who you they didn't feel no virtue why it was the way you approach it everybody understand what I'm talking about the way you approach it you can rub shoulders with people all day long and they not draw any virtue from you at all right even though you have it right that's faithful that's right that's why brother Brown said Faith at the bottom of the pyramid is the most important that's the most important you got to have faith that you have virtue remember what I said about the Bible don't don't don't think that I'm that I'm U um adding to the word or taking from but the Bible says add to your faith virtue well add to what you believe ain't that the same thing as Faith yes add to what you believe virtue add to what you believe knowledge add to what you believe Temperance add to what you believe patient cuz it's what you believe first it's like sister Lis said it was very good the Fountain is inside the fountain is not something out there sure Jesus is the fountain but where is he now he's IM morphi right here he's nowhere else right come on now we know God's omnipresent omniscient but if we're the last and morphe of God this is where God is yes he's he's he's he wants that to work he wants that Fountain he wants you to see that that Fountain but you know what you control the nozzle yes of the fountain you really do you control but you go through life though and if you go out in your job place and you and you and you do little things that are wrong and people see that you do things wrong they can't draw virtue from that but if you go through where where Jesus was walking through a throng of people those people around him some of them didn't like him some of them hated him some of loved him but they didn't have a need like that little woman that had that had basically been on her period for 12 years I think it was 12 years she was having this issue of blood problem been to doctors brother Brown makes the illustration she spent all of her money she went to every doctor in other words she went to Mayo Clinic she went everywhere and they said we can't help you but she saw a man one time that I'm sure she had heard a lot of and finally she saw him and she said if I can touch the just the himem of the Garment I'll be made whole well when she touched him in Mark 5:30 we'll read here it says Jesus immediately knowing in himself see nobody else around him knew it m that's right no Peter didn't even know it that's right of course Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost at that time so he didn't have anything to contact with true right holy ghost hadn't been given so Jesus hadn't died so there was the Holy Ghost Peter was saying well actually you rebuke the Lord he said Lord everybody's touching you that's right in another word you mean somebody touched me but he said he knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes now the Greek lexican for virtue is dunamus dunamus is power Mighty work or strength brother Ernie vill Anda he he preaches a lot on on on dunamus he has spoken several times here on that and I I like that word that's power Mighty work and strength and we know that when brother brandham and then look what not it's Miracle might virtue Mighty then you got a miscellaneous form strength power and ability inherent power inherent power let me say something too remember what I said before people can have a certain amount of these virtues and not even be a Christian that's right that's what the prophet say it's actually per yeah because there are people that I like to be around that's not even Christians you say not Christians I said yeah because that like jimes Dad he has a virtue about him that he's a kind man he knows how to deal with business and I like in that aspect I like to be around him but now when he comes to the word of God he knows nothing about it there's no there's nothing to there's no Fountain to draw from so I don't draw virtue from that but there are people in our life amen that are virtuous people yes that you can draw strength from and if you'll listen to them they'll teach you something about life but now when it comes to God that's what I told Jim's dad one time and I he was sitting here I tell it again cuz I told it to him one time before I said I'll listen to you when it comes to matters of life but when it comes to the matters of the word of God I said you don't even know what happened with Jesus and the Pharisees cuz I was trying to explain to him one day he never read the Bible maybe he read it when he back he's 80 years old he probably read it 50 years ago and forgot most of it so but see you can draw virtue or strength from he has an inherent virtue from just the DNA of life okay but God doesn't want to deal in that because that will fail yes that's the point that will fail this virtue will never fail amen it'll carry you right on into the future home that virtue will help people it will help look it says inherent power power residing residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature that's why by the new birth we have to have a nature change yes reading first Peter says or second Peter says what having the divine nature of God then he says add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance but inherent power power residing In A Thing by virt of its nature or which a person or thing exerts or puts forth see there's a two- stage thing you got to have it and you got to be able to give it all right you got to have it you got to be able to give it all right power for performing Miracles are moral power and Excellence of Soul all right so that's the Strong's definition of that word when Jesus said virtue has went from me the power and influence which belong belongs to riches and wealth see there you go to the Natural side of it all right power and resources arising from numbers power consisting in or resting upon armies forces and host all right now in Luke 6:19 we read another version of what happened and the whole multitude sought to touch him but there went virtue out of him and healed them all now they sought to touch him they well just one woman this is another example another account of him going somewhere and said heal them all man he had a lot of virtue yes all right so that same virtue of that person's got to be in in in you and I then Luke 8:45 and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter said they that were with him said Master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me and Jesus said somebody in other words hasn't physically touched me yes cuz she didn't physically touch Jesus in his body that's that's right she just grabbed a hold of His Garment as it walked by she just touched it all right and Jesus said somebody have touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me all right in perseverance brother Brown said now perseverance to be persistent to try to make a goal trying to you got your mindset on something and you're persistent in it CU you believe it's the thing that you want and believe you can get it now pardon me to be persistent you've got your mind made up now that you're going to do now you cannot have faith in God without knowing the word of God or knowing something about God now watch here's his point now someone told you if you go touch that post you'll get well you're sick I wouldn't believe that why there's no virtue in the post right virtue has to come from somebody person all right I wanton I won't believe that I wouldn't believe that you might do it but that's just a little too strong for my faith I don't believe there's any virtue in that post yes no more than I believe there's virtue in a statue or a monument or a truth crucifix or something like that I believe the virtue is in Christ and Christ is the word yes all right in beginning was the word word with God Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now the word itself comes back in the form of the Holy Spirit into us and it's word in you God in you so many wants to point God to some mystical something wh away are so far away they overreach it God's in you amen the hope of glory Christ the mind that within Christ is in you you're reaching Plum away from that trying to get what's been given to you God in the human being so there is the virtue God in the human being all right I mean you can't draw you can't draw virtue from like he said a light poster a or a car you got to draw virtue and streng that kind of virtue and strength comes from an inner being working its way out like I said many times before it's happened to me once in my life that I know of for sure than that was in Jamaica and that that I got so weak that I couldn't that I had to sell down and U and it's happened one time before in personal life um for something that I was asking about but to get that virtue to get that virtue you got to have a need oh yes okay you got to have a need right so see we come to Faith you see how these things are laid out Faith got to have faith you got to believe then you got to have virtue in in in what you believe strength yes in the beginning was the word that's where it's got to come from it's got to come from the word of God see then you come up to knowledge all right so we're going back it's exactly lined out the way it should be all right so you got to have faith got you got to have a lot of virtue because virtue to me is very important look at brother randam he's a human mortal man I don't know if we'll get to read it right now or not but remember how many times in the prayer line they'd have to carry him off the platform why he said it's not me friend it's you doing it that's right he had it he knew he had it yes Silver and Gold Have I None he could say but such as I have I give to you well he just didn't give it to one man that's right it was good at night after night that's why I was telling him the other day brother Tim he he died at 56 years old but he look like he was about 70 yes just the same with Jesus was 30 and they thought he was 50 right I mean you're living in two Realms and people are pulling from you all the time yes people are pulling like a pastor is is a u is a Workhorse like we were talking he's an ox he's a burden Bearer well he's bearing your burdens whether you know it or not that's right but the reason we come to this church is we believe that there's virtue and strength here yes or you go somewhere else right so would I so that Pastor you're drawing brother BR said he said You Preach one sermon is eight hours work that's one sermon he preaches two he gets double over time yes I was thinking of when Jesus healed them all it was a great crowd and it was they weren't Christians they couldn't have been there and all those people drew from The Fountain the Everlasting he didn't he didn't he got weak probably so it's it's that Faith now watch now what me with that point brother BR gets up and he says you're this you're this you're this you're this and then after about 20 people he's just gone but now he said I can go sit and have a vision from God and it not bother me a bit right why that's not God's not drawing virtue from Brother brand right right brother Brown's drawn virtue from God which is an everlasting Fountain and in the body he's in now the glorified body he's in now he's not going to ever get weak that's right he's finished with that his days of the intercessory are over right he's still the high priest you understand but he's glorified when we get glorified he don't have to be an intercessor anymore that's right okay so he's in a glor ifed body he never gets weak that's why he said when I come back as the Holy Ghost I'm not going in other words I'm not going to be weak and have to go sleep in a boat and and you know and let a storm I mean how in the world this boat was not big true he was laying at the bow of the boat asleep then the storm comes up and he's still sleeping brother Brown said he had a prayer line right weak in the body but see now we draw off brother Brown says the Everlasting Fountain yes the Eternal Fountain so it just keeps flowing but what it does though it flows down into you and then you're a conduit you're a conduit you're God to the people that's what I told him that's what I told him in witch I said God doesn't want to stay God by himself that's right he wants you to be God act like God that's what this is that's the statue that when Jesus walked on the earth as a human man but he was almighty God that's the way he acted yes he didn't act no different than that oh we got a little mad throw it away but you what didn't stay mad long because you know what it's like what daddy always said he beat him out of the temple but I'm sure he stopped and prayed for him somewhere in the somewhere in the in the daily walk he would pray for him and that's what I believe Jesus cuz remember when he was on the cross he was praying for him so that's the character and look at virtue him hanging on the cross now look to me and you if we were to if we were to just not at know anything about Jesus walk up to the crucifixion see three people hanging there he'd be no different than anybody else but now watch the thief on the right and the thief on the left in his in you know they both were mocking him at first but something about that man touched that man Jesus something about that man touched this one over here this one over here didn't draw anything off of him this one over here Drew something from him yes cuz he realized that the man was different and that's the same way I want us to be in our life in our walk I want people to say not that I testify that I'm a Christian I want somebody to say there goes somebody that's different they may not give you the title Christian because they see Christians that drink smoke cuss and I mean Christianity now is no more than you know nothing nothing it's really not anything you can do all those things and still be a Christian in this world but I want somebody to say hey he's different right than those people that claim to be Christians cuz that's the greatest stumbling block in the world is for you to claim you're a Christian and somebody see a beer in your hand or you know hear you cussing somebody out or anything like that but brother Brandon was he drew from God on those Visions so it didn't bother him okay okay same way with me and you cuz brother R said I can preach the word of God for 2 or 3 hours he said but now one or two of these visions of of the healing part of the vision that he had of the people he said it drains me dry right now why is there a difference cuz we're going to go upstairs today and we're going to listen to the word of God and we're going to feed off of that virtue okay yes we're not going to get weak right the preacher's going to get weak whether you see it or not virtue is being drawn but it's not making us weak cuz we're the one doing the drawing and that's why brother R could draw strength from God that's why we draw strength from the Holy Ghost I mean you sit and read your Bible and honest to goodness the devil's going to make you sleepy God won't you know that's right so I mean you can sit there and read your Bible all day long and not be not get weak cuz you're drawing strength from God but what God wants is is God wants somebody to draw strength from you amen is that not what our purpose is here for true so that's why virtue is very important one of the next ones in line right there after faith is virtue that you have the virtue let's read this one right here we'll see the Bible says we read over here in the Book of Luke where it says virtue one out of him all right congregation says amen we're going to be like him yes we must have virtue then see these things are a requirement we must have it to be like like him yes some of your sisters say well I I I I don't I don't preach and I how do people draw strength man you sisters draw more strength off of each other than you can from me or brother Dale cuz you know each other you're a different Venus and Mars remember you're different okay us men can draw strength off of men but what I'm saying is you sisters understand yourself you understand each other that's why y'all get together and and you ought to get together and you ought to you ought to talk about the Bible says many times about the younger should listen to the older that's right now that's the virtue part yes and that may not mean just exactly agewise true but maturity wise I've seen a lot of 60y old people that men that I wouldn't draw a lot of strength off of cuz they act like a 20-year old that's right but I've seen some 20-y old like brother um Glover up there 18 years old and you can draw strength from that guy because you know what he's got it in here amen it's not out here it's in here and it's not of age as far as when he was born into this world it was when he was born again right and he's made your available for God and that's the whole thing you got to make yourself available for God if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him is the first song that I ever loved in the him one of the greatest was to be like Jesus well if I'm going to be like Jesus I got to have virtue look and to pass that it can pass forward from me to the people yes don't just be see you the character in you should never be that I'm going to keep my virtue and never give it out that's not the character of God right character of God is I've got it I want to give it away that's true right I've got to have virtue and a Pion that can pass forward from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient fund see no no none there to draw from check bounc somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner not much virtue can be drawn from that let's just keep reading virtue must be in us and until we get virtue then then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith remember what I said add to what you believe virtue yeah it's got to be what you believe after what you believe then when that truth then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall he's making it a wall it's a next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it wow right faith alone won't do it why you're not complete without with just having faith all right now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it you've got Peter said then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it through your faith now then it might be the reason you don't have it because many churches of the day teach you don't have to have it or the days of it is passed they don't have to have it only thing you have to do is just join Church yeah days is passed virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means see and we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he'd expecting the same virtue in his church amen because he was our example and if he had virtue to give it to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength and power he expects you what he said he said I in other words I expect you to give it out that's I don't expect you to keep it I expect you to give it out that's why we draw strength and virtue from each other we draw a lot of things that that uh sometimes are not good but uh that's the old human side and that's what we're trying to get rid of though cuz I'm sure cuz look Peter said I was on the mountain with God I saw the Transfiguration I saw all the things on that great Mountain saw the adoption of the Lord saw his body glow saw him glorified but then you come over into Peter after he receives a new birth and he said I have received now a more sure word of Prophecy yes what's a sure word of Prophecy it was in him not just the man that was standing on the mountain right that man on the mountain was now inside of him what about 20 in the upper room had these virtues birthed into their life why because they had heard from the man himself they didn't get it from 14and information or even secondhand information they got it from God Almighty cuz they walked three and a half years with it all right so these virtues were birth into them because why God knew that they would need it once they stepped out of that upper room that he knew they needed the full package deal to combat everything that was going cuz you know this was a new thing yes this was a new religion it was Jews Old Testament Jehova messiah's coming now they're teaching messiah's already come he's gone and come back he's now in us and we're going to go take it to the people so God had to God had to fortify them with all these virtues but now you and I as we begin as a newborn baby in Christ we don't have all these virtues we may have a portion of them but we won't have the the full part of virtue until one day God's going to reveal it to you cuz he will he'll reveal to you that you have virtue cuz it's only Revelation that's true add to what you believe virtue right and then what examples we were looking at examples you you look at people like Moses the people drew strength off of Moses but Moses had his problem people do strength off of David but David had his problem all right then you come on into the New Testament and look at U look at Peter James and John everywhere they went Mighty things happened why they have virtue yeah they had virtue and they had plenty of it because what happens with false Doctrine false Doctrine doesn't bring true virtue cuz you can't draw from that amen now some people might be deceived into liking it or believing it or whatever but false Doctrine will not produce true virtue so we got to get all that out of the way but a true understanding of the word of God you know what it does you got to have confidence cuz without confidence you can't have virtue true do everybody understand what I'm saying without confidence you can't have virtue we're getting ready to go upstairs man we're done we start at 10:00 no that's fine yeah them people don't tell you down there they don't tell you nothing sit down how you doing buddy good good good to see you good to see it U would that be U yeah go ahead the um River's plural of water s that flowing out of us those those eight eight virtues there yep CU faith is actually a virtue as well right yes well now actually yes it is but actually there's only seven ads cuz you get the seven ads gets you to love CU it says add to your faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness what brothery kindness and love all right but there is the eighth like the eighth day okay and that love up here at the top of the pyramid that's not anything to do with I love my wife I love my right job I love football I love I love no love to me is the worst defined word on this Earth wouldn't you say yes the worst defined word I love this oh I love to do this I love to read I love to do this I love to go hunting that that we eroded that word because that word right there love is a man came one day and died right yes gave his life right so that you can have eternal life that's correct he had it bottled up inside of him and there's no way to get it out unless that shell of the man the shell of the man not the inside the Inside Man can't die right he was God Almighty he wasn't a son or or a second person of a trinity he was God Almighty himself yeah now it would be I'd be a horrible Rascal if I was told my son said hey son you go down there and die for them people now what kind of daddy would that be no I'd go first yeah right there's no second person he was God Amen how many people have you ever saw stood on the face of the Earth and said I'll lay my life down and I'll pick my life back up you talking about it yesterday yeah what a powerful thing have have you heard anybody tell you that sir there's no human mortal man can do that it had to be God Almighty in a human flesh yeah because Isaiah 53 real quick for our visitors and for you Isaiah 5 53 he gave this for a sacrifice yes he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity now the soul of God never went through that that's right but that soul of God was the ransom that was paid he gave his soul a ransom so he could see his seed so when his soul came out of that body at Calvary the Bible said the first thing he done was went to hell that's right and if he went to hell with eternal life in him which he did and preached or witnessed to the people that had never met him right what the Bible says went to the souls that were in prison preached to them that the longsuffering the days of Noah in other words Noah preached about Jesus he didn't say Jesus cuz he didn't know the name Jesus but he preached about God Almighty right saving a group of people yes it's sure he did they turned him down so God had to come down into hell and if he went to hell with eternal life in him right yes and if you have eternal life because of that that man that eternal life same eternal life that come out of him in Calvary comes back on to you at the New Birth when you're born again not when you quit drinking smoking cussing and running around right that's not it that's a good Sanctified life the devil can live that true he can Devil's not some s drunk right oh he's pretty religious guy but when that eternal life went to hell and preached to those people that was my representation that I don't have to go there amen brother Tim I've already been to Hell that's right so I don't have to go again yes God Almighty went to hell with me in him yes right and then when he came back and comes into me cleans that old me out kills that old nature of that person that was once the old wayale that was you couldn't even live with couldn't even live with myself when he drives that Spirit out puts his spirit in then you don't have to go to hell you already been there that's right all we go through hell on Earth sure but that's this thing yes yes but see Jesus did two things he gave his body the Lamb of God he gave his body as a sacrifice but he gave his soul a ransom yes right he ransomed us out in other words he said hey take me not them that's right but in taking him there goes to dingdong and taking him and putting him in hell I went with him so when he resurrected I rose with him I don't have to die again hallelujah amen amen but virtue we're going to stay on virtue one more Sunday and then we'll go to knowledge okay so just keep keep virtue in your mind okay it's
