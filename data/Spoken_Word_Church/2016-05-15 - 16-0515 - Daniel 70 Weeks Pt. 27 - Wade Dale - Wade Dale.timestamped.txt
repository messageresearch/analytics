[0:00] people need airplane no family
[0:02] especially a brokedown one the brown
[0:05] said you travel lock us off that's right
[0:07] so I think sometimes we go too far but I
[0:11] believe there's a middle of the road
[0:12] that we can see same way with its
[0:16] dangling 70 weeks there's people that go
[0:18] off on this side people walking this
[0:19] side stay in the middle watch my brother
[0:22] I'm says and I'm going to go back to
[0:23] this one more time in 1977 then we'll
[0:27] carry on what I'll do is review what I'm
[0:30] going to do next sunday is is I'll have
[0:31] everybody a sheep approach and then I'll
[0:35] have a sheet of scriptures that will
[0:37] reference for about the next trip full
[0:38] week okay I'll have one where you can
[0:41] compile them together the like I told
[0:43] you before several years ago I put in
[0:45] Daniel 70 weeks separately and every
[0:51] time because you know sometimes he
[0:52] programmed I talked about daniel's 70th
[0:54] week but every time whether I'm say
[0:57] anything about Daniel I got quotes for
[0:59] but when I done what I separated the
[1:01] ones out that didn't have anything to do
[1:02] with that kept the week because remember
[1:04] Daniel is a complete book of Revelation
[1:07] for the jew that that's a proven to
[1:10] given you know and brother i'm even told
[1:12] us daniel is a revelation just like
[1:15] revelation just to us and the jew that
[1:17] book of daniel is to the Jews and if
[1:20] you'll keep reading the parts were not
[1:22] reading it tells you about all the
[1:23] kingdom ten kingdoms is fixing to go
[1:26] down to a kingdom and those eight
[1:28] kingdoms are going to be ruled by one
[1:29] head and that one heads going to be this
[1:31] than any other it tells you what this
[1:33] world is going to be I mean we're not
[1:37] going to be here but it's going to be
[1:38] that beef nation it's going to come up
[1:39] in here it's not going to be just one
[1:41] beach person but it's gotta have a head
[1:44] and that head is telling what the body
[1:46] want to do okay which will be these
[1:49] nations remember Nebuchadnezzar had the
[1:52] dream about the ten about the nation's
[1:54] you come down to the 10 ko's in 505 clay
[1:57] brother Graham coach
[1:58] what that was about you know iron and
[2:00] clay Khrushchev and Eisenhower so you
[2:03] got he identifies that but the stone
[2:07] comes down and breaks all that okay so
[2:11] no question no more question okay all
[2:15] right so let me read this real quick
[2:17] right here only how many times 1 10
[2:20] times brother Brown says anything about
[2:22] 1977 right now in condemnation if you'll
[2:27] read over here I predict this will take
[2:31] place before 1977 that when he's doing
[2:33] is he's telling his dream he's
[2:36] predicting it will take place let me
[2:38] just pull it up right here now I think I
[2:42] now we go to count conferences which is
[2:45] a week or so later 1916 he's predicting
[2:49] they'll take place between 33 and 77 I
[2:51] remember he hasn't got the daniel stamm
[2:54] to eat yet he hasn't ever caught it back
[2:55] to a scripture he's only tie it back to
[2:57] his dream and the the closeness they
[3:06] work to it 16 years he knows five of
[3:08] them already come passel to others gotta
[3:10] come back all right so now in allowed
[3:12] sensor teeth talks about it in your
[3:14] vision church aid now in the layoffs the
[3:17] interchange Laodicean 13 I don't say it
[3:21] will but predicted OEM by nineteen
[3:23] seventy the church will go completely
[3:24] into pasta since you'll be ousted out of
[3:26] the mouth of God now that's already
[3:28] happened the denominational world is not
[3:31] it already been ousted out of the mouth
[3:33] of God all right and then we'll always
[3:37] jump coming out but now that you can you
[3:39] know you can just go to bathroom
[3:40] anywhere you won't do a bunch of
[3:43] perverts I'm telling you I like what the
[3:46] assume they one thing about Texas people
[3:49] don't like people in Texas but they'd
[3:50] one thing about Texas you don't take
[3:53] this every year has to agree to be in
[3:57] the United States they have to pass they
[3:59] they they every year the legislature has
[4:02] to
[4:02] for them to be in the United States of
[4:05] America they can be their own state if
[4:07] they want to be react google it do that
[4:12] Rachel don't believe what I said go do
[4:13] it hey I'm glad she did somebody I'll
[4:17] just believe it and go on but if you
[4:18] look at it she finally said yeah you're
[4:20] right but yeah Texas has to be they have
[4:23] to vote to get back in the Union but
[4:24] Texas governor when he got that
[4:27] directive from Obama the other day to
[4:29] allow that to happen he said my paper
[4:34] shredder turned on and I forgot about he
[4:38] shredded and this on the news he said I
[4:40] shredded it he said ain't nothing to me
[4:43] we're going about business just as usual
[4:45] you know men go to men when we go to win
[4:47] something so I like Texas Texas company
[4:50] make sure they stand up with what they
[4:53] believe in front yeah they're like carry
[4:55] guns the church will go completely new
[4:57] pasta since you'll be ousted I about to
[4:59] die and the second coming are the right
[5:02] to the Christ might come anytime now I
[5:06] can miss that a year makes it 20 years
[5:08] mrs. 100 years but you'll notice he
[5:11] never said that the rapture would take
[5:14] place in 1977 he never said that now we
[5:18] come to 19th we come to the 70th week of
[5:20] Daniel now we know again watch either he
[5:26] was thinking Jesus being 33 years old or
[5:29] he was thinking in 1933 he had that
[5:32] vision not concur three Simpson because
[5:34] we know for sure Jesus didn't die in a
[5:36] t-33 he died in 1830 we know that
[5:39] remember we went back to the seals where
[5:42] everybody says that was when he was gone
[5:44] come to his perfection and said to Jesus
[5:46] died in 1830 so ok slip of the tongue or
[5:49] to hide it from the wise and prudent
[5:51] that's ok with me but I know what he's
[5:53] talking about the 1977 was that same
[5:55] span of time then what's he doing this
[5:59] is the only time he ever takes it to
[6:01] scriptures in Daniel 7 you ate that's
[6:04] one to me I believe it's a marker it's a
[6:08] marking time so time we can mark it on
[6:11] our own our ocala
[6:13] that we've got you know we marked the
[6:14] first time 49 years 80 30 when the
[6:20] Israel become a nation 1977 right here I
[6:23] mean no one's ever came a nation but
[6:25] 1977 and then the last week okay that's
[6:31] why I believe that 1977 he puts it to
[6:35] the scripture he didn't clear scripture
[6:38] it would just be that he would
[6:40] prophesied that that would happen those
[6:42] seven visions would take place by 1977
[6:45] but now watching I don't believe him
[6:51] here's what he says he's accident in
[6:54] 1933 he predicted that and he did that
[6:57] and I predicted that there would be some
[6:59] great tragedy happen to this United
[7:02] States before or by the year nineteen
[7:04] seventy-seven now listen this is how
[7:10] subtle it can be let me just put this
[7:12] out there brother Brown said no nation
[7:16] has stood for 200 years right right
[7:23] when was our nation founded 1776 right
[7:31] 1970 states would have been 200 years
[7:34] there right now well for 1976 for those
[7:41] of you that weren't even born in 1974
[7:46] Nixon resigned as president and they
[7:50] appointed gerald ford as president
[7:55] that's unconstitutional this nation was
[8:00] founded on a vote to vote in the
[8:04] President of the United States Gerald
[8:07] Ford was appointed before 1976 to me the
[8:13] nation ended nothing whatever whenever
[8:15] they appointed gerald ford we never will
[8:17] and what you say well I not and we
[8:20] continue to be a democratic nation not
[8:24] our laws were being taken away
[8:26] everything since 1976 every president
[8:29] has been riding I don't care who he is
[8:32] okay I mean even brother ramps at
[8:34] Eisenhower was a Christian we did have
[8:36] some Christian man that was trying to do
[8:38] things in the United States but then you
[8:41] come to Nixon I mean how long before him
[8:44] they got killed Kennedy all right I just
[8:47] was reading it just a few minutes ago
[8:48] and the damn same two weeks book about
[8:51] Kennedy no way that was in here this
[8:54] morning 970 weeks he didn't talk about
[8:56] but another book talks about how did he
[8:59] want all the women one to kiss scene and
[9:02] ran against him you know no
[9:04] and said that the John F Kennedy in
[9:07] other words what he was saying with John
[9:08] activity was a pretty boring all the
[9:09] women left him you know for the women
[9:11] put him in by popular vote that's what
[9:13] he said would happen women were put him
[9:15] in by about but you say well
[9:18] they be some great tragedy happened well
[9:20] they did that was the tragedy that
[9:24] happened our president didn't get voted
[9:27] in our president was appointed okay so
[9:33] that's to me that you said well that's
[9:34] too so well you explain something else
[9:36] happen brother Brown said something
[9:38] happened before 1977 so go back in
[9:41] history and find out a lot of things
[9:43] happen in that 70 you know come up
[9:46] betting on war among all these things
[9:48] that came up we were coming out of civil
[9:50] rights era it was just a horrible time I
[9:54] knew he wasn't something do I Kennedy
[9:58] was kind of in 63 he was assassinated
[10:00] see this was before he was assassinated
[10:02] some even the seventh week of Daniel was
[10:06] 1961 he wasn't even Sasson eight then
[10:09] but you understand what I'm saying I can
[10:12] see where something happened now most
[10:14] people new message go out he was wrong
[10:15] nothing's happened to me that was a
[10:19] great tragedy and you can't get away
[10:22] from it because it happened okay could
[10:25] you really doesn't say some great trend
[10:28] he said well he stole America desolate
[10:30] he's a prophet the man can see years and
[10:33] years and years and years and years in
[10:35] here here news enemy but you know what
[10:38] caused that to happen is something that
[10:40] happens here right something happens
[10:44] here is what causes that tragedy we're
[10:46] going to be blown up because maybe what
[10:48] happened during the nineteen seventies
[10:50] we'll never know until the time we go
[10:53] and when all things are made right I
[10:56] don't think we'll know all the
[10:57] underlying things that have been going
[10:59] on listen we're that's a bunch where are
[11:02] really a bunch of known people in the
[11:03] brain I don't talk about Oliveira game
[11:06] come back without the Holy Ghost you're
[11:08] needed I'm really you are hanging people
[11:11] up to get fed all these things and they
[11:12] just go
[11:14] okay you know and bro browse it without
[11:17] the Holy Ghost your bees right well
[11:20] without the Holy Ghost you are under
[11:21] that be system you know you do have more
[11:24] gonna be so that makes you what in to be
[11:26] sister alright so where that come from
[11:29] but anyway there's true though hmm so
[11:37] before the year nineteen seventy-seven
[11:38] something did happen a tragedy happen in
[11:41] the United States that's just what I
[11:42] believe all right why did brother
[11:47] branham weigh heavy on the boat of a
[11:50] woman if because Rick look really a
[11:52] democracy if you have voting rights look
[11:55] at what's coming up millions and
[11:59] millions of people are voting for Donald
[12:00] Trump but if he goes to that convention
[12:02] the CIM engineers or the electoral
[12:05] college doesn't have to elect them and
[12:10] if they don't guess why he's gonna be a
[12:12] ride and mr. Obama himself cocoon you
[12:19] know he could declare martial law and
[12:21] state president so long so and that's
[12:25] coming up this year something of that's
[12:28] got to happen this year because the
[12:29] elections in November of this year so I
[12:32] say we've come down people now where we
[12:34] can that we can almost watch and i
[12:36] believe the God that God has took us to
[12:38] a place that we can watch everything
[12:39] that goes on now and we can put a
[12:42] prophecy behind it you know and we're
[12:47] walking through the world and we're
[12:48] doing our job we're raising tears and
[12:51] family you know for us to continue to do
[12:52] that if not you're going to drive
[12:55] yourself absolutely crazy that's
[12:57] terrific any of this and when I say 2019
[13:00] you know if that makes you if that makes
[13:01] you a little nervous you should be well
[13:05] I've got kids don't you think on You Man
[13:07] I stayed another day i'm thinking i know
[13:11] they were a little child is going to be
[13:12] here the day after day play and you know
[13:17] what it's going to be to me the most
[13:19] perfect time to have a raptor because he
[13:22] is going to pick the most perfect
[13:24] time to have a record listen I n man Jim
[13:30] listen to a song the other day and I
[13:32] really enjoyed it and I just will finish
[13:34] up with this and he's talking about when
[13:37] you're on your knees and the answer
[13:40] doesn't come and he said what's what's
[13:43] the rest of it says when your world is
[13:47] falling apart no stop hanging on just be
[13:52] he'll just be held yell bit when the
[13:54] world when your world starts falling
[13:56] apart is actually falling into place if
[13:58] you're a Christian and you say my world
[14:01] is falling apart how can you say that
[14:06] how can you say that your world's
[14:08] falling apart if you're a Christian it's
[14:10] not it's falling into place he's putting
[14:12] you where you need to be because you
[14:14] know what you're going off this way
[14:16] child and daddy's going my go here so
[14:26] when your world starts falling apart
[14:27] it's actually falling into place if
[14:29] you're a Christian now if you're not
[14:31] then it's going to be a horrible now but
[14:33] remember you gotta think listen to live
[14:36] in it when the rapture takes place think
[14:39] of all the good people it's going to be
[14:41] only something but remember one thing
[14:46] God knew the day he was coming he knew
[14:50] seven billion the seven billion people
[14:53] it's going to be on this earth for that
[14:55] day is the seven billion people that
[14:57] that thing's got to come down just right
[15:02] will be no babies left will be no listen
[15:05] don't gotta raise program like that
[15:08] couple buddies program like that God
[15:11] knows exactly this one what time to come
[15:14] you said well that's when we're ready
[15:16] don't you think you know when we're
[15:18] gonna get ready sometimes we think yeah
[15:22] we and we do limit God we do but but
[15:24] sometimes I like to sit and have one of
[15:26] those moments you know you go man I was
[15:29] listening to that song you know when
[15:30] you're all
[15:31] follow the part exactly fall in place
[15:32] anything is my world is falling apart
[15:35] know if your child too gone he's placing
[15:37] you were you supposed to be that's what
[15:39] this is when you're trying to get
[15:43] outside of this he's putting you right
[15:44] back in the template patient doesn't
[15:46] really kind of that's why it's like Jim
[15:48] said the song is it's not hold on you
[15:50] were trying to grasp a hold of something
[15:52] just be held by God yes he's unchanging
[15:56] he knows what you need before you get
[15:59] here so if you think he world's falling
[16:02] apart note this alright same one with
[16:05] this the world's got to come into a
[16:06] condition my brother Graham said about
[16:09] astronaut there's no there's no other
[16:11] time we could put somebody in space
[16:13] because we didn't understand pressure we
[16:15] didn't understand you know even if you
[16:18] want some of the old movies the old
[16:22] airplanes you know when we get up 30,000
[16:24] feet you have to be pressurized if you
[16:26] lose that pressure it's like a 10
[16:27] commuter school so you got to equalize
[16:30] the pressure but some of those jet
[16:32] bombers that were that were trying out
[16:34] the altitude when they got to a certain
[16:36] spot that couldn't breathe so what they
[16:40] done was they took oxygen tanks with
[16:42] them if you'll see some of the old
[16:44] movies or some of the old documentaries
[16:46] they got a thing hanging in the rounds
[16:48] right here as an oxygen tube and it
[16:52] keeps the oxygen to their brain as they
[16:54] go up and altitude that's the same thing
[16:56] with us that's why that if they turned
[16:58] all the oxygen golf when we went on the
[17:00] end you're in an airplane they turn me
[17:01] off you know you just going to be
[17:03] branded I mean you just go to fall
[17:04] asleep but they figure it but see why
[17:07] they figure that out they went to a
[17:09] certain spot then you want to do man's
[17:12] intelligence can mean marriage guns
[17:13] until it got intelligence is always
[17:15] first obviously but man's intelligence
[17:18] has come right up to where almost were
[17:19] God then hey listen somebody saying sup
[17:22] the other day and it was really funny it
[17:24] was an older gentleman play with
[17:25] yesterday at the fair appeal I stop him
[17:28] doing by something he said yeah I said
[17:30] they put something that it didn't look
[17:31] like it was in the place it should have
[17:33] been you know you can take your call you
[17:35] know our blue screens get our blue
[17:38] screen they put a blue screen behind
[17:41] anything they can have you standing in
[17:44] Africa in the other two outs down in
[17:47] anywhere you're just standing front of
[17:50] that blue screen and they can project
[17:51] the picture behind you and you're there
[17:54] and you can't that's what to do in
[17:55] movies they make these movies of these
[17:58] great big seas and they're falling all
[17:59] this stuff that's just a background the
[18:02] actors not even there so what's the
[18:06] devil's the same thing he's a blossom
[18:09] that's what movies do they bless you
[18:11] they Bluff you into believing their land
[18:13] you know but God's not a bluff god knows
[18:15] what he's doing so let's read this right
[18:18] him and next sunday will start putting
[18:21] quotes together that is it yet if nobody
[18:24] had any questions then you do understand
[18:25] what we're doing all right I'm not
[18:29] saying a date I'm not saying it's going
[18:31] to happen in 20 I'm just telling you
[18:32] there's some markers to tell us the
[18:36] ending of the week okay that week's
[18:42] going to end somewhere close to this day

[18:47] no 71st Jubilee all right all right then
[18:53] we got to back it up seven years for
[18:55] 2019 and it's just odd and strange that

[19:18] years that there's 25 hundred and twenty
[19:22] something days between October of 2019
[19:25] and october 26
[19:28] so and as a lot of things happen hey if
[19:33] obama declares martial law this whole
[19:35] nation is going to go into chaos they
[19:38] will be killing in the streets they will
[19:39] be shooting they will be trying to get
[19:40] your guns they're already working on own
[19:43] house to house warfare basket police
[19:46] department they're building cities towns
[19:49] to go door to door police department I'm
[19:52] coming right here at home county they
[19:54] built a facility door to door they're
[19:56] saying it's because we're going to have
[19:58] to maybe go overseas and go door to door
[20:01] and find these terrorists well the worst
[20:05] terrorist they're going to have to deal
[20:06] with is going to be the ones right hand
[20:08] okay so it's time it's not coming it's
[20:12] already here remember it's the Catholic
[20:14] Church maps out 30 years ahead don't you
[20:18] think our government knows there's
[20:21] something happening brother Rob you
[20:23] should have brother Ernie he sends you
[20:24] that about the earthquake samgrass they
[20:27] said is boiling the big fall over in
[20:31] from the Salton Sea all the way down
[20:33] brother Brown said from the Salton Sea
[20:34] to the to the Pacific Ocean now they
[20:39] talk about the Salton Sea that that
