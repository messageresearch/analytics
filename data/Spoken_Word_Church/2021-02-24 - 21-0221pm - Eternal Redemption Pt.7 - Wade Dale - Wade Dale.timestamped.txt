[17:41] [Applause]
[17:42] and that brings me to number one thing
[17:46] i want to since we're getting all back
[17:48] to church again
[17:49] i want to read you a couple of quotes
[17:50] for brother adam
[17:52] i know we all getting back to church
[17:54] again and everything we
[17:55] um i always when i i was always a
[17:59] manager when i was growing up
[18:01] and never was much just a i was a
[18:03] laborer or some
[18:05] but when you when you become a manager
[18:07] and take a position
[18:08] you have certain responsibilities
[18:12] brother brown said we're not an
[18:13] organization we're an organism
[18:15] an organism is a whole within
[18:18] interdependent parts
[18:21] brother brown said in church age of
[18:23] church at church order in 1958
[18:26] he said may every officer of the church
[18:28] fill his post of duty
[18:31] knowing this that god is going to hold
[18:32] you responsible for how you held your
[18:34] office in the church
[18:36] each one will have to give an account
[18:39] brother man said 1961 wasn't so from the
[18:41] beginning i think
[18:42] every person ought to be at your post of
[18:44] duty when your church is open
[18:47] that's correct that's exact you should
[18:49] stand by your pastor and stand by your
[18:51] board and stand by your church
[18:54] brother brahma 1962 he said we always
[18:57] want the people to stay at their post of
[18:58] duty now what he's doing he's announcing
[19:00] church services
[19:02] somewhere else he said but if your
[19:03] church is open you be at your post of
[19:06] duty now listen
[19:07] posted duty to me means you've got an
[19:09] office
[19:11] like i said about management when you
[19:13] get into management you're required
[19:15] listen if one of my trucks didn't get
[19:16] out if one of my
[19:17] employees didn't come in when i owned a
[19:19] trucking company guess who drove the
[19:20] truck
[19:23] okay i stayed and drove the truck i
[19:26] didn't galavan off somewhere
[19:27] and take a vacation okay everybody got
[19:31] that
[19:32] when your church is open every soldier
[19:33] ought to be at his rank and in his place
[19:37] brother brown said 1963 perseverance now
[19:40] if you have a post of duty you go there
[19:42] that's what you're supposed to do
[19:44] always stand at your posted duty that's
[19:47] your duty to god
[19:48] and pastor and the rest of your
[19:50] congregation
[19:54] okay so if you got an office in this
[19:56] church you should be here
[19:58] now we know as brother dale said this
[20:00] morning it's good to get these people
[20:02] out preaching
[20:03] these young brothers out preaching but
[20:05] don't everybody leave it at one time
[20:08] you've got a post of duty right here now
[20:09] if you're preaching somewhere that's
[20:11] different but just go out fellowshipping
[20:12] gallivanting around
[20:13] that's not right if you have a post and
[20:16] a job to do
[20:18] now brother chris the only post that
[20:20] he's got to do is sit in that seat right
[20:22] there
[20:23] and he said okay that's fine now if he
[20:25] goes off and wants to visit the brother
[20:27] so-and-so's church
[20:28] that's okay but just let us know oh yeah
[20:30] listen
[20:31] y'all can get on facebook and talk about
[20:33] your dog having diarrhea but you can't
[20:34] tell your pastor
[20:35] that you ain't going to be here
[20:38] he's the one you need to tell
[20:41] if you're a minister if you're a song
[20:44] leader or any kind of musician
[20:45] tell brother joe canada tell me we're
[20:49] right here
[20:51] but i will always if i'm the only me and
[20:54] brother dale's only two people here i'm
[20:56] i'm staying here even if i have
[20:57] something i have to do because this is
[20:59] my post of duty now we do go out and
[21:00] preach
[21:01] but we make sure we have a backup plan
[21:03] like brother
[21:04] um brother branham said he said we're an
[21:06] organism an organization
[21:08] organism has independent interdependent
[21:10] parts
[21:12] if you have a part in this church you
[21:14] need to be here when the doors are open
[21:19] i'm just reading quotes and you should
[21:22] be able to do that anyway that should be
[21:24] now if you don't want to be
[21:25] resign if you don't want to be and
[21:28] that's okay too
[21:29] sometimes i hated being a manager i
[21:31] wanted to resign i want to just be
[21:33] where i go in and go give me do my eight
[21:36] hours and
[21:37] let me go back home i wasn't built for
[21:40] that
[21:41] i guess because i never was able to do
[21:43] that except
[21:44] a long long time ago at mcdonald's but i
[21:46] have if you have a post of duty
[21:48] you have a responsibility not to another
[21:51] church to this church
[21:52] does not say that you don't need to go
[21:54] out and go to fellowship meetings that's
[21:56] not
[21:56] but if i'm reading quotes brother brown
[21:58] said if you have a church to go to and
[21:59] it's open
[22:00] you need to be here i think that's
[22:03] really simple but some of us are
[22:05] get oversimplified every once in a while
[22:07] and have to be told
[22:09] that it's wrong to do those things so
[22:11] it's it and and it reflects because you
[22:13] know what it does
[22:15] if you have a job here and we look
[22:18] around and we see empty seats here
[22:20] we see all the preachers gone and
[22:23] nobody's here you know what it does
[22:25] we start asking well where's so-and-so
[22:26] and where's so-and-so and if nobody
[22:28] knows where so-and-so is
[22:31] we got a problem i don't want to know
[22:34] your business but if you got business in
[22:35] this church
[22:38] everybody understand what i'm saying if
[22:39] you got to post to duty
[22:41] if you ain't going to be here don't pull
[22:44] the burley williams and call it 8
[22:45] o'clock on saturday night
[22:47] he's and he don't care if i tell him he
[22:50] knows that he's called me at 8 o'clock
[22:51] at night he's already in ohio gonna
[22:53] preach sunday and he wants me to preach
[22:55] for him the next more that morning so
[22:58] we know better than that we just don't
[22:59] get up on sunday morning to go i think
[23:00] i'll go church somewhere else well if
[23:02] you do then that's okay
[23:04] but if you have an office in this church
[23:06] you should not do that
[23:08] this is your post of duty right here and
[23:10] if like i said again if you don't want
[23:12] to do that it's not going to hurt our
[23:13] feelings now i'm talking me and brother
[23:14] dale we already discussed this
[23:16] you got to have opposed to duty
[23:19] filled look back here today and i saw
[23:23] empty seats there was nobody playing a
[23:24] guitar there was nobody playing this
[23:27] what are we doing you should want to
[23:30] fill a place
[23:31] you should want to fill a position if
[23:34] you don't then that's okay do like
[23:35] brother chris come to church shave your
[23:36] head come to church
[23:38] and come to work and then smiling eyes
[23:41] is all i see
[23:42] but you know what brother chris is happy
[23:44] that and i'm happy with to see him here
[23:47] because that's his post of duty brother
[23:48] brown said even just sitting in a pew
[23:52] but we miss you when you're gone i'm
[23:53] trying to make it a little bit funny but
[23:55] we do miss you when you're gone
[23:57] and we do wonder
[24:00] not to be nosy but you never know you
[24:02] don't you just say wow
[24:03] where you been what you've been doing
[24:09] just reading what the prophet said but
[24:12] this this church
[24:13] we get we're getting back to doing
[24:14] things i know and i was thinking
[24:16] yesterday
[24:17] we have become so i i don't even
[24:19] remember last year very much
[24:22] just things went by and it was all
[24:24] abnormal and we didn't do this and we
[24:27] didn't do that
[24:28] and now we're trying to get some
[24:30] normalcy back so it just
[24:32] sometimes it takes a little bit of
[24:34] shaking to get us back
[24:35] into our into our routine and i hope and
[24:37] pray that we get back into
[24:39] uh sunday school and bible study and all
[24:41] those things because
[24:43] i long for that whether you do or not i
[24:45] long to get together
[24:47] and talk about the word of god i don't i
[24:49] don't like to stand separate because you
[24:51] know what the devil likes for us to stay
[24:53] separate
[24:54] yeah man he likes for us to stay away
[24:56] from each other
[24:58] you know why because he's got more time
[25:00] in your brain
[25:01] but when you got people around you
[25:02] they're uplifting and building you up
[25:04] and talking about the word of god and
[25:06] talking about what god's done in your
[25:07] life
[25:08] then you know what the devil has no
[25:10] place there he hates that and i love
[25:12] that
[25:12] because he leaves because resist the
[25:14] devil and he'll leave
[25:16] and flee from you so just take that to
[25:19] take that to heart
[25:20] just remember if you have a posted duty
[25:23] you need to be here
[25:25] that's just pretty simple you got a job
[25:28] if you don't want the job
[25:29] somebody else may else want it but
[25:32] brother brown said you're
[25:35] you're responsible to god
[25:39] not to brother dale you're responsible
[25:41] to god for what you do so
[25:43] so let's just all be careful and do the
[25:45] right thing so god bless you
[25:48] just wanted to kind of get like i said
[25:49] we're starting back together getting
[25:50] things back in
[25:51] where everybody's coming up front now
[25:53] and make sure we all wear a mask and
[25:56] and and keep the uh keep this thing out
[25:59] of here so
[26:00] lord bless you and let's bow our head
[26:02] the heavenly father we thank you for the
[26:03] day that we're living
[26:04] and the time we have to be here forgive
[26:07] us of our faults and our many mistakes
[26:09] that we make lord
[26:10] i pray today that you would be the
[26:12] active participant in this service lord
[26:14] you do the speaking
[26:15] thank you father for the song service
[26:17] and the specials lord the different
[26:18] things the players
[26:20] lord we truly are an organism and we
[26:22] can't

[27:13] well
[27:15] and they would because they wanted
[27:17] nothing to complain about hebrews 9
[27:19] verse 11
[27:20] we're still on eternal redemption and
[27:21] we're going to get a little bit into the
[27:23] um the first three dimensions and i i
[27:26] got a little thought i want to share
[27:27] with you
[27:29] that you and i are living in three
[27:31] dimensions right the
[27:32] time life and matter we talked about
[27:34] that a little bit
[27:35] on wednesday but you remember you're in
[27:38] a three-part
[27:40] person body spirit and soul
[27:43] so you've got and those are to connect
[27:46] you to this world
[27:48] and to the other world to another
[27:51] dimension
[27:52] amen and we'll talk about that in a
[27:54] minute we'll read some of the things
[27:55] that brother brown said about that
[27:56] that by christ being a high priest of
[27:58] good things to come by a greater and
[27:59] more perfect tabernacle
[28:01] not made with hands that is to say not
[28:03] of this building
[28:04] neither by the blood of bull goats and
[28:06] calves but by his own blood he entered
[28:08] once into the holy place having obtained
[28:11] eternal redemption for us you may be
[28:14] seated in the lord at his blessing
[28:16] reading the word let's read number one
[28:18] real quick
[28:20] we've got to take communion today so we
[28:21] won't be very long job the oldest book
[28:23] in the bible was supposed to even be
[28:24] written before moses wrote genesis
[28:26] but the oldest book in the bible was
[28:28] speaking of redemption
[28:30] yet redemption was far way before that
[28:32] you know i was thinking
[28:33] also yesterday
[28:36] when god was writing his first bible
[28:40] when he looked down through time by
[28:42] foreknowledge
[28:44] he had to step out of eternity and look
[28:47] into time
[28:49] because that's what he's writing he's
[28:51] writing about our journey in moses's
[28:53] journey
[28:53] moses wasn't up in heaven as a person
[28:57] he was down here so god can move through
[29:00] what i'm saying is god can move through
[29:02] any dimension like brother dale was
[29:03] preaching this morning
[29:04] jesus christ before he
[29:08] was glorified everybody understand what
[29:10] i'm saying before
[29:12] he went to the cross before he had a
[29:14] body change
[29:15] he couldn't walk through a wall he was
[29:18] limited by the
[29:19] time life and matter that he came down
[29:22] in
[29:22] he was an eternal person
[29:26] but now when he came back after the
[29:29] resurrection
[29:30] he appears to the to the disciples and
[29:33] he just walked through the wall
[29:35] brother brown said he went through so
[29:36] fast so the adam just broke up and then
[29:39] he came what then he became solid again
[29:41] because they said oh he's a ghost and
[29:42] they said he said give me some fish
[29:45] where'd that fish go it went into his
[29:48] body
[29:49] all right so that's what we're looking
[29:51] at is that when we see this that god
[29:54] wrote this plan of redemption he had to
[29:56] go ahead
[29:57] and look in he had to go drop into time
[30:00] watch everything that went on in time
[30:02] and then pull back up into eternity
[30:05] to write the bible because that's what
[30:07] he's writing about our this right here
[30:09] if this
[30:09] was the book of the life of the lamb
[30:12] slain before the foundation of the world
[30:13] in the mind of god that had to happen
[30:15] but he had to see it it had to be in his
[30:19] thoughts
[30:20] how many of you have vivid thoughts and
[30:22] vivid imaginations and boy some of you i
[30:24] know do
[30:27] known you for a while what are you
[30:29] laughing
[30:30] bless your heart she can't call me old
[30:34] man in just a few months
[30:36] she'll be as old as me bless her heart
[30:38] but redemption is one of the oldest
[30:40] things in the bible
[30:41] redemption was even plan of redemption
[30:43] was laid out before the world was ever
[30:45] formed think of god see foreseeing
[30:48] for knowledge and making a way of
[30:50] redemption
[30:52] before he even made the world so he
[30:55] dropped down
[30:56] into time watched time through all these
[30:58] six or seven thousand years that he's
[30:59] watched time
[31:00] or longer and then now he popped back up
[31:03] eternity
[31:04] but remember he's an eternal being
[31:07] he can do that he's omnipotent he's
[31:10] omniscient he's omnipresent he has no
[31:12] limitations
[31:13] he's an unlimited god but he decided to
[31:17] limit
[31:18] him limit himself to come down here in
[31:20] human flesh as brother dale's talking
[31:22] about that same creator
[31:24] come down into this real slow first
[31:26] three dimensions
[31:27] and became a body of spirit and soul
[31:31] for the plan of redemption to be
[31:34] fulfilled
[31:36] all right so now because titus watched
[31:37] titus 1 verse 1
[31:39] it says in hope of eternal life which
[31:42] god that cannot lie
[31:43] promised before the world began the
[31:45] bible said who did he swear by he swore
[31:48] by himself
[31:49] so he is the orchestrator and he is the
[31:53] master scientist he's the master
[31:56] of everything because he's the one that
[31:57] done it but you and i have to do what
[32:01] by the fall we were detached from god
[32:04] now we gotta get back attached back to
[32:06] god
[32:06] but we know that how do you do it
[32:09] through preaching
[32:11] that's paul but hath in due times
[32:13] manifested his word
[32:14] through preaching which is committed
[32:16] unto me according to the commandment of
[32:17] god
[32:18] our savior and i uh
[32:22] brother dale is a he's he's always been
[32:25] my dad
[32:25] but he's always been a positive guy and
[32:28] he brings that positivity
[32:29] that is a word look it up google it he
[32:32] brings that positivity into the
[32:34] into the message of the hour where it's
[32:36] not so wild you as you wound doom and
[32:38] gloom
[32:39] why because that's the way i think god
[32:42] is
[32:43] god's not sure he got he got ill at
[32:46] people
[32:48] he got mad right got angry
[32:52] got jealous god's got all these
[32:55] attributes that we think no that's just
[32:57] reserved for human beings
[32:58] no he said i am a jealous god right
[33:01] that's right
[33:03] i am a loving god i don't know it's only
[33:05] one
[33:07] and i'm it is right that's what he said
[33:09] he said there's no other god beside me
[33:11] there's no word of god before me i am
[33:13] the only god
[33:15] now he can say that because he backed it
[33:17] up
[33:18] but through preaching and through the
[33:20] baptism of holy ghost you can say the
[33:22] same thing that you
[33:23] are a part of god the same part of god
[33:26] that said let there be light the same
[33:28] part of god
[33:29] that that created man in his own image
[33:34] because you're the image that he created
[33:38] you know brother ray you're the very
[33:39] living living image of that genesis 1 26
[33:42] man that's why i love it so much if
[33:43] you'll connect yourself to that
[33:45] that's your image and god created
[33:48] you put your name i don't care if you're
[33:50] a sister too put your name in god
[33:52] created
[33:53] wade in his own image in an image of it
[33:56] just got
[33:56] separated by the fall
[34:00] so that he could be a redeemer so they
[34:02] could be a healer so that he could be a
[34:05] savior
[34:06] because he had those groaning attributes
[34:08] inside of him
[34:09] and they had to the only way as brother
[34:12] luis read the quote a long time ago
[34:14] the only way that god could fulfill his
[34:16] correct and full purpose is to become
[34:18] human flesh
[34:20] that's right it was listen i don't want
[34:22] y'all to get the idea that god said oh
[34:24] man i got to go down there now and get
[34:26] human and
[34:27] that was the whole plan right right he
[34:31] was he loved it
[34:37] you don't take my life he said
[34:41] i give it amen he didn't die
[34:44] the roman spear didn't kill him the
[34:45] roman nails didn't kill him
[34:49] he said into the hens i command my
[34:51] spirit
[34:52] he died when he wanted to when he had to
[34:56] he was in complete control on that cross
[34:59] and thank god you and i were there with
[35:01] him amen
[35:03] all right so ephesians 1 we know paul
[35:07] speaking of ephesians in verse 4
[35:08] according as he has chosen us
[35:10] in him before the foundation of the
[35:12] world not chosen of him but chosen
[35:14] in him before the foundation of the
[35:16] world that we should be holy
[35:18] and without blame before him in love
[35:20] having what predestinated us into the
[35:22] adoption of children
[35:23] now what is adoption adoption is what
[35:26] the placing of a child
[35:28] the organism that we're talking about
[35:32] brother brown said four people can't be
[35:34] a a heart
[35:36] one heart but you can be a kidney you
[35:38] can be a pinky you can be a little
[35:40] you can be a partner you can be an arm
[35:42] you can be a leg
[35:43] because that's the body of god the body
[35:44] of god is not just one big heart
[35:47] the body of god is feet toes legs and
[35:50] all the way up
[35:50] to the neck and that's what you need to
[35:53] find out where you're at
[35:55] and get in it that's your post of duty
[36:02] somebody somebody's posting duty in this
[36:04] church is to pray for us every week that
[36:05] you'll get a good sermon from god
[36:08] amen oh that's just that's the bet
[36:12] brother brown said how the success of my
[36:14] meetings is what your prayers
[36:16] he said two women remember the two old
[36:18] ladies he said they prayed in that
[36:20] closet
[36:21] and he said i had success because of
[36:23] their prayer
[36:24] wow to me that's supposed to duty
[36:28] but they knew what it was and they got
[36:29] into it they got an unction from god and
[36:31] they started praying
[36:33] how many of you prayed for a good
[36:34] service amen
[36:36] you should pray for a good service why
[36:39] would you
[36:40] not what do you come here for if you're
[36:42] not praying for good service
[36:45] we need to fellowship with god
[36:48] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[36:50] when he hath accepted us in the beloved
[36:52] in whom we have redemption through his
[36:54] blood the forgiveness is what
[36:56] sins according to the riches of his
[36:58] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[37:00] in all wisdom and prudence
[37:01] have been made known unto us so there's
[37:03] something as brother dale was talking
[37:05] this morning
[37:06] there was something that god was going
[37:08] to make known now he was going to make
[37:10] no the father
[37:11] was going to declare the son and the
[37:13] bible says the son declared the father
[37:17] where were we inside that sun
[37:22] so what happened he in morphed on the
[37:24] day of pentecost it didn't do away with
[37:26] that son
[37:27] because that son of god came back on the
[37:30] day of pentecost
[37:31] inside the people and inside your
[37:33] pentecost on your day of pentecost he
[37:35] came inside of you
[37:36] but you and i live under the open book
[37:39] the son of man showing that this thing
[37:41] can be redeemed
[37:44] right here luther couldn't do it because
[37:46] luther laid in the floor
[37:48] and beat himself with whips trying to
[37:51] get this thing
[37:52] and his thoughts lined up with god
[37:55] couldn't happen he was under
[37:56] justification
[37:58] but still the longing was there right
[38:01] the longing was there even under luther
[38:04] coming out of catholicism his longing
[38:07] was
[38:07] was to be better and to be a christian
[38:10] and not be what he was what he
[38:12] saw back in the do you do the same thing
[38:17] i don't want to be what i was six months
[38:18] ago eight months ago three months ago
[38:21] and you know what we all got
[38:22] denominational ideas
[38:24] hello all of us do
[38:28] so thank god he's got us out of that
[38:31] that's thinking thinking we're talking
[38:32] about
[38:33] now look that in the dispensation of the
[38:34] fullness of times he might gather
[38:36] together what this organism
[38:39] this body of christ he's going to bring
[38:41] it in together
[38:43] in one all things in christ both which
[38:45] are in heaven and which are on earth
[38:47] even in him i want you to pay attention
[38:50] to that heaven and earth
[38:52] because we're going to get something in
[38:53] just a minute whom also we have obtained
[38:55] an inheritance in other words no you
[38:59] didn't have anything to do
[39:00] with god calling you but you did have
[39:02] something to do with
[39:04] answering him amen you have nothing to
[39:07] do
[39:08] many are called fewer chosen god's god
[39:10] wills that no one
[39:12] be lost but he knows who will accept it
[39:14] and walk in it and he knows who will not
[39:18] we don't that's why brother they said
[39:20] brother brown will you preach why do you
[39:22] even preach
[39:23] if everything's you know in other words
[39:24] there you go that predestination
[39:26] cut and dry he said i don't know who's
[39:29] saved and who's not saved
[39:31] he said i keep preaching the gospel
[39:32] throw the net out there i might get
[39:34] snakes i might get
[39:35] frogs but i get a couple of fish every
[39:37] once in a while amen
[39:39] because in whom also we have obtained an
[39:41] inheritance being procrastinated
[39:43] according to the purpose
[39:44] of him who worketh all things after the
[39:46] council of his own will
[39:49] let's read romans 8 28 and we know all
[39:51] things work together for good to them
[39:52] that love
[39:53] god to them that are they called
[39:55] according to its purpose this is just a
[39:57] little bit more on four knowledge
[39:59] for whom he did for no thereby
[40:01] understand
[40:02] what we're talking about foreknowledge
[40:05] is first f-o-r-e-4
[40:09] b4 before god could predestinate
[40:14] he had to have knowledge of what he's
[40:16] going to predetermine
[40:18] everybody got that he had four knowledge
[40:20] he stood here in time
[40:22] and he watched everything unfold
[40:25] he said all right this is what's going
[40:26] to happen this is the way it's going to
[40:29] be
[40:29] but remember he didn't come down here
[40:32] and influence
[40:35] you or anyone else more than he did
[40:38] anyone else
[40:40] because he's not a respecter of persons
[40:41] he saw what your choice would be
[40:43] and you know what he done he also knew
[40:45] that your choice would be
[40:47] when he come down here and he he was on
[40:49] earth and he
[40:50] and he preached a sermon about the uh
[40:52] about the seed and the sower and
[40:54] once one was on stony ground one was on
[40:57] this kind of dirt one was on this kind
[40:59] of dirt
[40:59] what happened the seed was planted but
[41:02] the cares of life
[41:05] made that seed die the roots didn't get
[41:07] far enough
[41:08] it didn't get planted deep enough so the
[41:11] birds came by and took it away all these
[41:12] different things that's what
[41:13] that's what he saw happen because he was
[41:16] a caesar seed planter he's been a seed
[41:18] planter since the beginning of time
[41:20] he's the only one that is a seed planter
[41:23] amen
[41:24] for whom he did for no he also did
[41:26] predestinate to be conformed to the
[41:28] image of his son
[41:29] that he might be the first born among
[41:32] many brethren
[41:34] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[41:36] he also called and whom he called them
[41:38] he justified who he justified
[41:40] them he also glorified so he knows
[41:44] how far you're going to go he knows how
[41:47] far
[41:48] everybody's going to go but yet he
[41:51] didn't he's not going to come
[41:52] ever come that's why i said it's just
[41:54] real simple how the devil works
[41:57] god says you can make it satan says
[42:00] you're worthless
[42:02] you say no no god tells me i'm god's not
[42:04] gonna tell you you're worthless
[42:07] that's right listen i and myself know
[42:10] i'm worthless
[42:11] right but i look what i was chosen in
[42:14] him
[42:15] so if he went to calvary brother chris
[42:18] if he took my stripes
[42:19] if he took my shame if he took every sin
[42:22] i ever committed
[42:23] then where am i the sinless
[42:28] perfect bride of jesus christ the bible
[42:31] says he will present to you without
[42:33] with him without spot or wrinkle
[42:36] a glorious church the bible tells us so
[42:39] let's just start listening to what the
[42:41] bible says and forget what the devil
[42:42] says
[42:43] amen power of god the word predestinate
[42:47] that's not a good word to use the word
[42:49] for knowledge is better now this is a
[42:50] prophet speaking
[42:52] predestination looks back to
[42:53] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[42:56] destination
[42:57] but god not making sitting in order a
[42:59] little hole that you have to go through
[43:03] do you understand that to be a righteous
[43:06] judge he cannot
[43:09] now there's been billions of people on
[43:10] this earth
[43:12] he can't treat them no different or they
[43:14] can stand in the day of judgment and say
[43:16] you treated me differently
[43:18] every person was put on free moral
[43:20] agency
[43:21] even the devil himself and his
[43:25] angels were put on free moral agency
[43:28] because they chose his
[43:29] message over the lords we already
[43:31] covered that
[43:32] but god knew that he predestinated i was
[43:34] thinking yesterday and
[43:36] and sometimes you have to kind of get a
[43:38] little you have to eat a brownie every
[43:40] once in a while
[43:43] terence likes brownies so we've got to
[43:45] eat a brownie every once in a while
[43:48] put you in a different mood but you know
[43:51] what the bible says
[43:52] and even brother brown said god we'll
[43:55] talk about that later
[43:56] god cannot see your sin
[44:00] even as a christian remember he hears
[44:01] your voice through the blood
[44:04] but now i believe he has a legion of
[44:07] angels though that can come down and
[44:09] walk right beside you
[44:12] even through all the things you do
[44:14] because listen what did brother brown
[44:16] say on adoption
[44:17] he said the holy spirit would go back to
[44:20] the father now he's using it as an
[44:22] illustration the holy spirit doesn't
[44:23] leave your body and go
[44:25] over it no it's communicating we'll get
[44:28] to that in a minute
[44:29] listen god put you in flesh to stay
[44:31] right here
[44:33] but he made you a soul first
[44:36] and that soul can go there how do you
[44:40] get a revelation you don't get a
[44:41] revelation in this dimension you get a
[44:43] revelation coming from another dimension
[44:45] when it's from god it's coming from
[44:46] somewhere else
[44:48] so that makes you a spiritual person and
[44:50] a human person
[44:53] wow but we look and see that by foreign
[44:57] knowledge though
[44:59] he knew who would and who wouldn't
[45:02] and he knew how far you would go and
[45:05] even even like i said in adoption he
[45:07] knows how far you could go and
[45:08] he knows how much he can give you you
[45:10] know a lot of times we
[45:12] and we pick on our kids a lot but we
[45:15] were kids too at one time
[45:17] but you know your your parents expect a
[45:20] lot out of you
[45:21] some do good some don't but god expects
[45:24] a lot out of you but he knows the end
[45:27] from the beginning we don't
[45:30] but you know what you got to do as a
[45:31] human being though
[45:33] if you put yourself in christ
[45:37] won't that holy spirit direct you ain't
[45:39] not what it was given for
[45:42] to lead you and guide you into all truth
[45:46] if you'll let that spirit man on the
[45:48] inside
[45:50] listen to what's saying from that other
[45:52] dimension
[45:53] not what's going on here because
[45:54] remember look
[45:57] brother harris had a good quote i like
[45:58] what he said he said
[46:00] these three he said where you're living
[46:02] at is not even so this is not even
[46:03] supposed to be
[46:05] i mean it is yeah we're here but it
[46:08] wasn't supposed to be this way
[46:10] we were supposed to come to adam and eve
[46:12] and just have a glorious time and always
[46:14] be in eden and always be in eternity
[46:16] but that didn't happen right so this is
[46:19] all working under permissive will
[46:21] because
[46:22] none of this everything you see the
[46:23] bible says is temporal
[46:25] or temporary and the body you live in
[46:28] which is a
[46:30] mortal body has to be changed to made it
[46:33] make immortal or it has to go to a grave
[46:35] but that doesn't do away with you
[46:38] you go into another dimension whether it
[46:41] be five or six
[46:42] thank god for a prophet to tell us where
[46:43] they all go
[46:45] thank god for a prophet to tell us that
[46:48] we live in three dimensions
[46:50] and even if you'll look that up i've
[46:51] been looking it up through the week
[46:54] because we think dimensions and it is
[46:56] dimensions that are faster and slower
[47:00] but you know we live in three dimensions
[47:02] aaron what's the scripture that's
[47:03] the height the depth and the breath we
[47:06] live in that dimension
[47:08] dimensions lengths
[47:12] heights breaths i look at depth
[47:14] perception because the wall is back
[47:15] there
[47:15] see we live in this world that has
[47:19] dimensions
[47:22] but with god there's no time there's no
[47:26] dimension
[47:27] he has no limitations you and i have
[47:29] limitations i'll get to in just a minute
[47:31] when we got into time is when god said
[47:34] the day you eat thereof that day
[47:36] you'll die there was no dying before
[47:39] that
[47:40] but when when god said die
[47:43] that puts you in a 24-hour day it puts
[47:46] you now still adam lived 920 years after
[47:49] god said that
[47:50] but he eventually passed away
[47:53] he was mortal
[47:58] you and i are mortal but that thing that
[48:01] was inside of adam
[48:03] it wasn't mortal it was in the spirit
[48:06] realm
[48:07] because remember adam before he was put
[48:09] in the flesh
[48:10] was brother brown said like the holy
[48:12] spirit he just covered all over he was a
[48:14] person
[48:14] but he ruled the whole earth the whole
[48:17] world he ruled it
[48:19] wow don't you think though that that's
[48:21] not what's going to take us right back
[48:22] to where we're going
[48:24] amen take her back to the garden of eden
[48:27] what before the fall not after but
[48:29] before the fall
[48:31] because time brother brown said will
[48:32] blend into eternity because remember
[48:34] time is so strong though look we depend
[48:37] on it
[48:40] we all depend on a time clock
[48:45] and you know what that's why that there
[48:47] they're saying now that they may pass
[48:49] legislation here in the state of georgia
[48:50] to keep the
[48:51] daylight savings time where it is where
[48:53] it changes in march and it won't change
[48:55] anymore
[48:56] because how many times have you it's
[48:57] messed up for about three or four days
[48:59] why because you're a time creature and
[49:02] you get this gain an hour losing our
[49:04] business and your body's just all
[49:06] man you ought to go to the philippines
[49:10] you're 12 hours into the next day
[49:15] that'll mess you up but you know why
[49:18] though because we're creatures of time
[49:22] brother chris was here the other day and
[49:23] he's two or three hours different from
[49:25] us in arizona and
[49:26] he said i don't know why i'm so hungry i
[49:27] said because it's five o'clock in
[49:28] arizona
[49:30] because your body is hooked to that it
[49:33] was five o'clock there
[49:34] you know and it was it was like eight
[49:36] o'clock or something here or something
[49:38] like that and he
[49:38] he's like why am i hungry i said well
[49:40] your body's still back out there in
[49:42] arizona somewhere
[49:43] in time so we're still all creatures of
[49:46] time
[49:46] but when are we going to stop when we
[49:48] come into this
[49:49] when we come under this umbrella of god
[49:52] and and the
[49:53] and the revelation why do we need to be
[49:56] in time
[49:56] and i'm not talking about looking at our
[49:57] time clock make sure we don't preach two
[49:59] hours
[50:00] i'm talking about why do we have to
[50:03] worry about time why do we have to worry
[50:05] about tomorrow why do we have to worry
[50:07] about
[50:07] when we're sitting here today take that
[50:09] thing and blank it out
[50:11] don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow what
[50:13] the bible say tomorrow will take care of
[50:14] itself
[50:16] we all know tomorrow's what day
[50:19] monday and for all of us that work it's
[50:22] one of the worst days why
[50:23] because we've had saturday and sunday
[50:25] well some of y'all have to work on
[50:27] saturday being a postal
[50:28] employee but you have sunday where you
[50:30] just relax a little bit
[50:31] and and you really don't have to feel a
[50:34] lot in time
[50:35] but boy monday morning
[50:40] you're going to work whether you like it
[50:42] or not
[50:45] so let's don't worry about it though
[50:47] right
[50:49] but like i said before and i'll talk
[50:50] about in a minute we we are influenced
[50:53] i don't believe adam the reason i'm
[50:55] saying is i don't believe adam was
[50:56] influenced by time
[50:58] i don't he was i don't think he was
[51:00] influenced by dimensions because he was
[51:02] as far as the earth he was the god of
[51:04] the earth now what does that mean that
[51:05] means he was ruler of the earth
[51:08] but when they did what they did and when
[51:10] god
[51:12] declared the day you eat thereof that
[51:14] day you die and then that day
[51:15] came that locked them into those these
[51:20] first three dimensions
[51:22] to to for them to live in but still
[51:24] remember though what was adam created
[51:26] first
[51:27] spirit being god had to have a
[51:30] connection with the spirit world
[51:32] with adam so he could talk to him
[51:35] what about me and you you were given a
[51:39] soul
[51:39] for what to choose by and when you
[51:42] choose god
[51:43] god doesn't talk to you through your
[51:45] seed tastes phil smelling here
[51:48] god does talk to you through your memory
[51:49] reason conscious effects and imagination
[51:51] but somebody else does too
[51:53] but if you're born again of a spirit of
[51:54] god that soul inside of you
[51:57] came from eternity and came inside of
[52:00] you
[52:01] and you should be able to let that thing
[52:04] out
[52:04] and think eternal thoughts listen to me
[52:07] a revelation is eternal thought
[52:09] glory revelation is not time thought
[52:12] it's an eternal thought it's something
[52:14] eternal that god
[52:15] and you know what brother adam said it's
[52:16] sovereign he'll give it to you but you
[52:19] know what
[52:19] he's not going to he didn't give the
[52:22] revelation of the seven seals to brother
[52:23] neville
[52:25] not knocking brother neville at all
[52:26] wonderful minister wonderful brother
[52:28] but why didn't he give the revelation he
[52:30] knew he couldn't handle it
[52:32] he knew by foreign knowledge
[52:36] before knowledge he could predestinate a
[52:38] gift
[52:39] down in this end time called the seventh
[52:42] church age messenger and he knew that
[52:44] man would be in the eagle anointing and
[52:46] he could go higher
[52:48] and be able to stand i was reading some
[52:50] quotes a few minutes ago
[52:52] or last night sorry where brother
[52:54] branham was talking about he said
[52:56] you just don't know let's talk about
[52:59] sound barrier
[53:00] he's talking about breaking the sound
[53:02] barrier but he's talking about doing
[53:03] that in the prayer line
[53:04] he said cause when that he said when
[53:06] that sound bear breaks
[53:07] he said when i go into another dimension
[53:10] he said i don't know if i'm here
[53:11] or i don't know if i'm there now what
[53:13] about a man that walks and didn't know
[53:15] what place he was in
[53:16] and he was standing there he said you
[53:18] just don't know what i have to go
[53:20] through
[53:20] right i don't i don't think i'd want
[53:23] that gift
[53:24] i'm like brother dale i think i want to
[53:26] thank everybody loves me brother i'm new
[53:28] he felt a knife in his back
[53:30] when they were hugging his neck they
[53:32] were you know sticking the knife in his
[53:33] back because he knew
[53:35] what they were thinking he knew god had
[53:36] let him look look in a faster dimension
[53:40] listen when he was up there in that
[53:41] prayer line there was those demons
[53:43] and nobody could see them by him that
[53:46] come from another dimension
[53:48] they wasn't end time lighting matter
[53:50] they didn't have length breath and depth
[53:53] length breath and depth no they came
[53:55] from another dimension brother brown
[53:56] said i was reading yesterday
[53:57] he said oh sister you've got cancer i
[54:00] said oh sister you've got cancer too so
[54:02] the reason i know it
[54:03] he said that demon is screaming to that
[54:05] demon for help he said i see a black
[54:07] line going across
[54:08] i thought my goodness
[54:12] i'd go crazy if i could see all the
[54:15] demons y'all
[54:16] okay questions and answers number four
[54:19] how can i take a huckleberry
[54:22] i'll leave it alone i already got people
[54:23] upset how can i take a cockapoo and make
[54:26] a grain of wheat out of it
[54:27] it's impossible for me to do it the only
[54:31] thing is what
[54:32] now look here's my thought on this and
[54:35] the process i'm taking while i left that
[54:36] quote in there
[54:37] the kookaburra has been transmitted from
[54:39] a kookaburra
[54:41] from a kookaburra wheat a cocoa bird to
[54:43] a germ called wheat life
[54:44] now that can't happen in these first
[54:46] three dimensions you are a person you
[54:48] are doomed you're dying you're on your
[54:50] way to hell right
[54:53] right but by the transforming power of
[54:57] god
[54:57] through the eternal life that he had
[55:00] he's the only one that can come inside
[55:03] of you
[55:03] burn your old nature out your cuckoo
[55:06] burr
[55:07] nature and put his life in
[55:10] the wheat germ oh you still look like
[55:13] you do but
[55:14] but i hope you manifest different yeah
[55:17] i hope you're not drinking beer smoking
[55:18] cigarettes and running around doing all
[55:20] these things ladies cutting your hair
[55:21] not you see you manifest on the outside
[55:23] what's on the inside
[55:25] you have to because once that life now
[55:28] still
[55:29] you know you you made to the outside
[55:30] world we look like huckleberry still
[55:33] but we should never act like one
[55:36] we should never act like like we used to
[55:38] before
[55:40] then you bury that cuckoo bar it'll
[55:41] produce a grain of wheat because there's
[55:42] a life of wheat put in that kookaburra
[55:45] and the life of the cuckoo bird has been
[55:46] taken out but the nature of the cuckoo
[55:49] bird is still sticky what what's he
[55:50] talking about he's talking about still
[55:52] you've got that spiritual nature of
[55:53] memory reason conscious effects and
[55:55] imagination
[55:56] that will torment you until we take a
[55:59] body change
[56:00] but it less torments you a lot less when
[56:03] you go up that statue of a perfect man
[56:07] because it takes some of them old demons
[56:09] out
[56:10] all right so as long as you're in this
[56:14] life you're going to be sticky and have
[56:15] a carnal nature
[56:17] what is carnal what does carnal mean
[56:20] just for a second
[56:21] human human nature
[56:24] you're going to have a human nature
[56:27] until the day you take change of the day
[56:29] you pass away
[56:31] because you won't come back with that
[56:32] that kind of human nature when you come
[56:34] back into this
[56:35] dimension with that glorified body
[56:37] that's what death does death separates
[56:40] that
[56:41] right the body stays in the earth
[56:44] the soul goes into the sixth dimension
[56:47] but that sixth dimension
[56:49] empties into this dimension picks up
[56:51] that body glorifies it
[56:53] and you don't have that sticky nature no
[56:54] more
[56:56] thank the lord that's what that's why
[56:57] brother brown said why do i fear death
[57:01] all the things all the things
[57:04] sister alicia all the things that
[57:06] bothers us
[57:09] if i could just tomorrow
[57:12] now i don't want nobody wants sister
[57:14] lisa to die or me either one i hope
[57:17] yeah but if we pass away all that's gone
[57:21] it all passes to john and the yangons
[57:26] but for us though you see how god does
[57:28] it though god said brother brown said
[57:29] death they'll take you
[57:31] into that sixth dimension he said and
[57:34] death is only the vehicle
[57:36] that'll take you there because you we're
[57:37] trapped in this thing right here
[57:40] you can't transmigrate my soul we'll
[57:42] cover that a little bit later not today
[57:44] but you can't take my soul and put it in
[57:46] that set of drums
[57:47] you can't take my soul and put it in
[57:49] brother donnie and him
[57:50] into mine because their brother brown
[57:53] covered that in the church age book
[57:54] because there's doctrines that
[57:55] that you can migrate a soul and then
[57:57] even
[58:00] the mormons we were all souls up in
[58:02] heaven
[58:03] literal people according to their
[58:06] doctrine
[58:08] walking around making plans
[58:11] helping the lord helping the devil and
[58:14] then all of a sudden we come down here
[58:16] to fulfill that plan no brother brown
[58:19] said you were nothing just just realize
[58:21] let's realize that but realize when you
[58:23] get the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:25] that takes your mind and turns it back
[58:27] to where it was
[58:28] that you have heavenly thoughts that
[58:30] this thing is not going to be over when
[58:32] you die
[58:33] it's just your beginning and if you're a
[58:35] christian
[58:36] no more no more sorrow pain no no no no
[58:40] no
[58:44] and never will you have to come back
[58:46] here like you were before
[58:52] why would death scare you as a christian
[58:54] right
[58:56] paul says oh death where's your sting
[59:02] grave the only grave the only victory
[59:04] the grave had was he kept him in there
[59:06] for just a little while but you know
[59:07] what paul's waiting
[59:09] paul's waiting because when paul steps
[59:12] back into this dimension with his people
[59:14] that body is going to have to yield to
[59:16] paul
[59:18] and that body is going to connect back
[59:20] with paul and he's going to be a young
[59:22] guy again
[59:22] i've always said before brother dale was
[59:25] talking about this morning we think
[59:27] now this is the way we think if i don't
[59:29] get any further than this that's okay
[59:30] this is the way we think
[59:33] we think that this thing right here is
[59:36] so solid and so
[59:39] it's dying but that
[59:42] soul inside of you i can't explain it
[59:45] but god had a body back before the
[59:48] foundation of the world
[59:50] and it wasn't it had no
[59:54] fall to it
[59:57] but that's what we think we think oh
[59:59] when we move into this spiritual realm
[1:00:01] that we're a lesser person
[1:00:04] no this is the most less you'll be
[1:00:06] that's even
[1:00:07] this would be the less you'll ever be is
[1:00:08] right here
[1:00:10] because that thing inside of you always
[1:00:13] was eternal
[1:00:14] it is solid and more solid than death
[1:00:17] itself
[1:00:19] because you know what when the apostle
[1:00:21] paul
[1:00:22] when he laid his precious neck down on
[1:00:24] that chopping block
[1:00:26] and that guy did his job and he whacked
[1:00:28] that thing right
[1:00:29] right in the middle of his neck and his
[1:00:30] head went rolling this way and his body
[1:00:32] fell over
[1:00:34] when paul just a few seconds later when
[1:00:36] he stepped over into that other
[1:00:38] dimension
[1:00:39] he did not have to go find his head
[1:00:43] he didn't have to go no nope he
[1:00:46] when he stepped over another dimension
[1:00:48] he thought man got a pain in my neck
[1:00:51] got a cricket in my neck but it went
[1:00:54] away just like that
[1:00:56] so which one was greater the paul that
[1:00:59] mama and daddy brought
[1:01:00] are the paul that god met him there on
[1:01:02] the road to damascus
[1:01:03] and give him the baptism of the holy
[1:01:05] ghost there's nothing going to harm us
[1:01:07] folks nothing can harm a christian you
[1:01:08] can't be shot
[1:01:10] your soul can never be shot it can never
[1:01:12] be broke up into pieces
[1:01:14] but now listen folks if you don't turn
[1:01:16] yourself over to god
[1:01:18] i don't know what your soul gonna look
[1:01:19] like
[1:01:21] it's gonna be tormented don't know what
[1:01:24] that is don't want
[1:01:25] don't want to know just get born again
[1:01:29] just get born again it'll take care of
[1:01:31] every bit of that
[1:01:34] psalms 135 139 15 says my substance was
[1:01:37] not hid from me when i was made in
[1:01:39] secret
[1:01:40] listen we had to be made between mama
[1:01:42] and daddy
[1:01:44] that's what that's talking about we had
[1:01:46] to be made between
[1:01:48] mom and daddy and i read you the quote
[1:01:49] where brother brown said we were
[1:01:51] born between satan and eve
[1:01:54] people hates that in the message they do
[1:01:56] not like that quote but guess what
[1:01:58] it's true
[1:02:04] when i was made in secret and curiously
[1:02:06] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:02:08] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[1:02:11] being unperfect
[1:02:12] and in thy book all my members were
[1:02:14] written which in continuous were
[1:02:15] fashioned
[1:02:17] as yet they weren't even on this earth
[1:02:21] who was he told jeremiah one of them he
[1:02:23] said i he said i
[1:02:25] called you before you was in the womb of
[1:02:27] your mama
[1:02:28] well now that's a figure of speech he
[1:02:30] went down there calling for jeremiah no
[1:02:32] he knew
[1:02:33] what jeremiah was going to be when
[1:02:35] jeremiah was born
[1:02:36] whichever one of them it was he knew
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:40] he couldn't say now see even brother
[1:02:42] brown will talk about jacob and esau
[1:02:45] jacob have my love he saw how i hated
[1:02:48] see there he
[1:02:49] no by foreknowledge he knew what esau
[1:02:52] would do and he knew what jacob would do
[1:02:55] so therefore he could by election
[1:02:59] say jacob have i loved and he saw how i
[1:03:01] hated
[1:03:04] pretty simple huh
[1:03:08] so now let's talk about dimensions just
[1:03:09] for a few minutes we live in three
[1:03:11] dimensions which is
[1:03:12] light time and matter
[1:03:16] let's read here brother brown this
[1:03:17] number i think it's quote number four
[1:03:20] present stage of my ministry if you want
[1:03:22] to read about all seven dimensions and
[1:03:24] get ahead of me read present stage in my
[1:03:26] ministry and he'll tell you about all
[1:03:27] seven
[1:03:27] so we've got light time and matter and
[1:03:31] it's kind of uh we'll get to that in
[1:03:33] just a second now when we come along we
[1:03:34] remember we live here in three
[1:03:35] dimensions
[1:03:36] and i don't know whether i can name them
[1:03:38] or not one of them is light the other is
[1:03:40] matter
[1:03:40] tommy he's either talking to tommy
[1:03:42] osborne or tommy hicks i think
[1:03:44] remember what the third is someone says
[1:03:46] something he says adam and then somebody
[1:03:47] says time time right
[1:03:49] light matter and time and our five
[1:03:51] senses contact them dimensions our sight
[1:03:53] contacts light
[1:03:54] our feelings contact matter and so forth
[1:03:58] number five face without works is dead
[1:03:59] look here friends let me give you this
[1:04:01] illustration i might have done it before
[1:04:03] what color is that shirt it's white
[1:04:05] anyone's got sight know that that
[1:04:07] shirt's white
[1:04:08] you have five senses of body see taste
[1:04:10] fill smell in here
[1:04:11] now none of these senses will declare
[1:04:13] god
[1:04:15] there to declare this world when god
[1:04:19] made man he made him in his image
[1:04:20] instead of man so what's he saying he
[1:04:22] made man in spirit image
[1:04:25] not in five senses not in the sea taste
[1:04:28] phil smelling here that we know of you
[1:04:30] understand what i'm saying that we live
[1:04:32] by now
[1:04:36] when god made man he made him in his
[1:04:37] image instead of man's and he put him in
[1:04:40] five senses to contact his earthly home
[1:04:42] that's genesis 2 7.
[1:04:44] not to contact god with those senses
[1:04:47] don't declare god they declare the
[1:04:49] earthly home where the man had to
[1:04:50] contact his earthly home
[1:04:52] he had to see taste feel smell in here
[1:04:55] but faith is the substance of things
[1:04:57] hoped for
[1:04:57] the evidence of things not seen you do
[1:05:00] not see it taste it feel it smell it or
[1:05:02] hear it
[1:05:02] but you believe it see what i mean so
[1:05:05] you see
[1:05:06] taste feel smell and here
[1:05:09] is what's connected in here but now what
[1:05:11] makes all that work is what's down
[1:05:13] inside
[1:05:15] amen the motivator of you is your inside
[1:05:19] person your soul that's the motivator
[1:05:22] that's where all motivation comes from
[1:05:25] that's where your life comes from that's
[1:05:27] the real you
[1:05:28] that's what separates you from an animal
[1:05:31] you have a soul to decide right and
[1:05:33] wrong
[1:05:35] everybody got that but we live in
[1:05:38] like i said before we live our body is
[1:05:41] actually in three dimensions
[1:05:44] body spirit soul like i said before
[1:05:48] your body is put here
[1:05:53] to contact this world and to do the
[1:05:55] things of the world
[1:05:57] now your spirit realm what's it for your
[1:05:59] spirit realm is to contact
[1:06:01] the inside of the inside guy
[1:06:05] everybody got that but your soul is the
[1:06:07] real you
[1:06:08] that's the real person of you that like
[1:06:10] i said the bible says
[1:06:12] don't worry about the body you can't
[1:06:14] make your stature no bigger
[1:06:15] and he's the bible even tells us is
[1:06:17] don't worry about who can kill your body
[1:06:20] don't worry about who can kill your
[1:06:21] spiritual being he said but you worry
[1:06:23] about that person that can kill your
[1:06:24] soul
[1:06:25] and the only one person that can kill
[1:06:26] your soul is god almighty
[1:06:28] amen he said don't worry about if you're
[1:06:30] born again don't worry about the second
[1:06:32] death
[1:06:32] well you say second death your first
[1:06:34] death is physical
[1:06:36] right and then if you get born again you
[1:06:38] have died
[1:06:39] and resurrected in christ and the second
[1:06:42] death
[1:06:44] white throne judgment has no hold on you
[1:06:48] we bypass that cause that theophany that
[1:06:52] genesis 1 26
[1:06:53] man is what god's looking at and if
[1:06:56] inside of you that's what god's looking
[1:06:59] at
[1:07:00] he can't judge you if you've already
[1:07:02] been judged what's inside the real you
[1:07:05] has already been judged i read you the
[1:07:08] quote last sunday
[1:07:10] we were in christ at calvary we were in
[1:07:12] christ at the in the tomb
[1:07:14] we actually went to hell with him when
[1:07:16] he went preach to the souls in prison we
[1:07:18] were inside that theophany
[1:07:21] so you don't have to go to hell again
[1:07:22] you already been
[1:07:26] but your body let me read something
[1:07:29] right here
[1:07:30] because man had contact with both worlds
[1:07:32] heaven and earth
[1:07:33] he had to be able to communicate with
[1:07:35] both these worlds
[1:07:37] that's why god made adam a spiritual
[1:07:39] being first but now remember
[1:07:42] he was made a spiritual being that was
[1:07:44] given eternal life
[1:07:46] as a grown man but you and i because of
[1:07:49] what happened in the fall
[1:07:51] because of the sex act you and i had to
[1:07:54] come
[1:07:54] a baby
[1:07:57] amen we had to come a baby and we had to
[1:08:00] be given a soul that came from god that
[1:08:03] was perfect
[1:08:04] right that's why all babies go to heaven
[1:08:09] that's why the age of accountability
[1:08:11] what the age of accountability in this
[1:08:12] world
[1:08:15] is what whatever you think 12 13 14
[1:08:18] whatever year old you want it to be
[1:08:20] it's when you know right from wrong it's
[1:08:22] when you know not to do what you're
[1:08:23] doing
[1:08:25] but god though has given you a human
[1:08:27] body
[1:08:28] by mom and daddy coming together through
[1:08:30] the egg and the sperm
[1:08:32] they give you this physical body listen
[1:08:34] there's no life in that everybody got
[1:08:38] that
[1:08:39] there's zero life in that brother brown
[1:08:42] said oh that's just wiggling muscles
[1:08:44] it's just what it's receptors firing
[1:08:47] it's the firing of your brain and
[1:08:49] everything being made but there's no
[1:08:50] life there thank god for a prophet
[1:08:53] he said the only time there's life is
[1:08:54] when that baby comes out of the womb
[1:08:56] and the doctor power and then god gives
[1:09:00] it life
[1:09:02] god gives it life but it's not eternal
[1:09:04] life he gives it a natural
[1:09:06] life he gives it a soul to make a choice
[1:09:09] with
[1:09:12] that's why i thank god for a prophet
[1:09:15] i was looking at a kid the other day
[1:09:17] from guilford
[1:09:19] and it's um
[1:09:22] tammy harrison and pete harrison we've
[1:09:24] known him forever they have a
[1:09:26] well she has a a child a down syndrome
[1:09:29] child
[1:09:30] and thank god brother branham i'm like
[1:09:32] how can god judge that
[1:09:36] he can't because that's what mom and
[1:09:39] daddy did
[1:09:41] he's locked into that
[1:09:44] but remember his soul doesn't look like
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:48] right and brother brown said he even had
[1:09:50] a special angel
[1:09:52] that was with him all during their life
[1:09:54] oh what a god
[1:09:57] what a god that can do that for somebody
[1:09:59] and he's got he's got
[1:10:01] a more chance to go to heaven than me
[1:10:03] and you sitting here and if you turn the
[1:10:05] word down you're going to hell
[1:10:09] but because of what man has done
[1:10:12] mama and daddy i love what brother
[1:10:14] branham in one uh i'll try to find it
[1:10:16] because i want to read that one
[1:10:17] he's getting a prayer line and they walk
[1:10:19] up and he's talking about demons and
[1:10:20] he's talking about we'll talk about next
[1:10:21] sunday and fourth dimension
[1:10:23] he talks about a demon and then somebody
[1:10:25] walks up and he said
[1:10:27] he said oh he said that's not a demon
[1:10:30] he said in other words that's just
[1:10:32] genetically
[1:10:33] something genetic going on in the body
[1:10:37] that's just because mom and daddy maybe
[1:10:40] because
[1:10:41] i think they do what different
[1:10:42] chromosomes when you have a down
[1:10:44] syndrome and they have too many of this
[1:10:46] one and not enough of this one
[1:10:47] well it says to me that's life but god
[1:10:50] gives it a soul anyway
[1:10:52] but he takes that soul and he says
[1:10:54] that's not your fault
[1:10:56] he said that's adam's fault he said but
[1:11:00] i went to calvary for adam
[1:11:02] he said i went to calvary for you too he
[1:11:04] said you don't have a way to make a
[1:11:06] choice he said
[1:11:06] so i'm going to give you eternal life
[1:11:07] now they'll never be bribed but guess
[1:11:09] what
[1:11:09] they'll have eternal life
[1:11:13] duty different ones i'm telling you you
[1:11:15] look at them you say boy
[1:11:16] no they got more chance than we do right
[1:11:20] if we don't get right with god
[1:11:24] but the three dimensions now listen
[1:11:30] if you'll think about this just for a
[1:11:31] second then we'll stop because we're on
[1:11:32] the three dimensions and i want us to
[1:11:34] take communion we'll go
[1:11:36] every time
[1:11:40] that god has to come down into this
[1:11:43] dimension
[1:11:46] a couple things happen now remember
[1:11:49] before the fall
[1:11:50] adam and eve brother brown said they
[1:11:52] just communed like this just every day
[1:11:54] you know
[1:11:54] god just walks down to cool today hey
[1:11:56] adam how are you doing oh dad i'm doing
[1:11:58] good
[1:11:58] everything's fine and then when the fall
[1:12:00] happened it separated that or unplugged
[1:12:02] that
[1:12:03] and they had to be caught into this
[1:12:05] dimension what about
[1:12:06] pearl adam i think man adam had all this
[1:12:09] responsibility and adam had all this he
[1:12:11] could
[1:12:12] he could just travel like a thought and
[1:12:13] be over there i just believe that
[1:12:17] and after the fall though that couldn't
[1:12:20] happen anymore
[1:12:22] he was stuck in this dimension the first
[1:12:25] three dimensions but you look and you
[1:12:26] see
[1:12:28] that when man fell time began so you had
[1:12:32] to start recording time
[1:12:35] but once that dimension locked in
[1:12:40] when god broke into this dimension it's
[1:12:42] always been with noise
[1:12:45] it's always been with two things thunder
[1:12:49] and a cloud you think about it
[1:12:53] you think about what i told you that
[1:12:54] brother brown said there in the statue
[1:12:56] of a perfect man
[1:12:57] he said it you sit there and you you
[1:12:58] listen and here it comes 2 times 2 is 4.
[1:13:00] 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2 is 4.
[1:13:02] faster and faster and faster what you're
[1:13:04] doing is coming into this dimension
[1:13:06] but watch in exodus 20 verse 18. let's
[1:13:08] go to that one real quick and we'll read
[1:13:10] that
[1:13:11] now remember brother branham talks about
[1:13:12] the sound bear and we'll read it next
[1:13:13] sunday
[1:13:14] and i believe that that's what happened
[1:13:16] when the seals broke
[1:13:20] god came from eternity to this dimension
[1:13:24] to give that seven seal book to that
[1:13:26] prophet for him to give it to us
[1:13:29] amen and what happened there was thunder
[1:13:31] and a big old cloud happen
[1:13:35] oh yeah that came from something
[1:13:36] supersonic
[1:13:38] it wasn't man though no
[1:13:41] exodus 20 verse 18 and all the people
[1:13:43] saw the thundering
[1:13:45] and the lightning and the noise of the
[1:13:48] trumpet and the mountain smoking when
[1:13:49] the people saw it they removed
[1:13:51] and stood afar off now when is this this
[1:13:54] is when moses
[1:13:56] god was giving moses the ten
[1:13:58] commandments
[1:13:59] which at that time would say brother
[1:14:01] brown calls it the seals
[1:14:04] thundering and lightning john 12 28
[1:14:06] father glorified thy name
[1:14:08] then came there a voice from heaven
[1:14:09] saying i have both glorified it and will
[1:14:11] glorify it again
[1:14:12] now jesus heard it but the people around
[1:14:15] him didn't hurt it
[1:14:16] hear it they heard thunder the people
[1:14:19] therefore that stood by and heard it
[1:14:21] said it thundered
[1:14:22] others said an angel spoke to him well
[1:14:24] look how mysterious this
[1:14:26] is all right let's read one more
[1:14:32] revelations 10 what happened in
[1:14:34] revelations 10 i saw another mighty
[1:14:35] angel come down from heaven closed with
[1:14:37] a cloud
[1:14:38] and a rainbow was upon his head in his
[1:14:39] face with a sun in his feet pillar of
[1:14:41] fire
[1:14:42] and he added his hand a little book open
[1:14:43] he said his rightful don't land his left
[1:14:44] foot on earth
[1:14:46] and cry with a loud voice and when he
[1:14:48] cried seven thunders
[1:14:50] uttered their voices any time god
[1:14:53] comes down when seven thunders uttered
[1:14:55] their voices i was about to write
[1:14:57] and heard a voice from heaven saying
[1:14:58] seal it up then we keep reading in
[1:15:00] revelations 19 verse 5 in revelation 6
[1:15:03] verse 1
[1:15:04] i saw when the angel opened one of the
[1:15:05] seals i heard it was the voice of
[1:15:07] noise of thunder but it wasn't just a
[1:15:11] noise because look one of the four
[1:15:13] beasts saying
[1:15:14] come and see listen i'm going to leave
[1:15:17] you with a start right here
[1:15:19] i don't care what this dimension we're
[1:15:20] in light time and matter
[1:15:22] we'll get to that next sunday because
[1:15:24] we're going to take communion today
[1:15:26] but when you have an experience with god
[1:15:31] it ought to shake you it ought to shake
[1:15:35] you
[1:15:35] like brother dale said about revelation
[1:15:38] revelation will change you
[1:15:40] there's only one thing that will change
[1:15:42] you because listen even brother brown
[1:15:44] said brother brown
[1:15:44] they said brother what is the new birth
[1:15:49] he said it's the revelation or the
[1:15:52] thundering voice of jesus christ
[1:15:54] personally to you
[1:15:56] because you hear what god said how many
[1:15:58] times brother brown said
[1:16:00] remember he was standing up on that rock
[1:16:02] and the whirlwind and all the people had
[1:16:04] to run under the bus and
[1:16:05] run under the cars and he said get down
[1:16:08] blew the mountain off
[1:16:09] why didn't it hurt him
[1:16:12] because god was speaking to him god was
[1:16:16] talking to him when that thing came down
[1:16:17] over him they heard nothing but just
[1:16:21] confusion
[1:16:22] that's the problem now they just heard
[1:16:25] confusion they heard what they wanted to
[1:16:26] hear
[1:16:27] but they said brother brown what was
[1:16:28] that he said god was talking to me
[1:16:33] up on that mountain to get marriage in
[1:16:34] divorce he said he came and told me
[1:16:37] and they looked at and they saw this
[1:16:38] amber light going up and down
[1:16:41] he didn't talk to them people down there
[1:16:43] at the gas station he was talking to one
[1:16:44] man
[1:16:45] same way with me and you let god speak
[1:16:48] to you
[1:16:50] i know we're stuck in this dimension
[1:16:51] we're stuck we're we're tired we're
[1:16:53] weary we're warned we're
[1:16:55] we're still concerned about first one
[1:16:57] thing in another
[1:17:00] please people believe that that thing
[1:17:02] inside of you
[1:17:04] is more real than you
[1:17:07] how or how are you gonna how do you get
[1:17:10] your healing
[1:17:11] i say god that thing inside of me is not
[1:17:15] sick
[1:17:17] it can't get sick this gets sick because
[1:17:21] mom and daddy brought it
[1:17:22] but that soul that god give you is
[1:17:24] eternal
[1:17:25] never will get sick never will have a
[1:17:28] problem our problem is his greatest
[1:17:30] battle
[1:17:30] ever fought
[1:17:34] why fight the thing that wants to save
[1:17:36] you
[1:17:38] but we do let's stand our feet
[1:17:42] these three dimensions yes sir they'll
[1:17:44] hold you right here right
[1:17:46] but remember if you're born again today
[1:17:51] you were a spiritual being before you
[1:17:53] ever before there ever was a foundation
[1:17:54] of the world
[1:17:56] you were a part of god you had a legacy
[1:17:59] you had a peace of god waiting on you
[1:18:01] and when you got down here
[1:18:04] you absolutely fulfilled
[1:18:07] what was there brother brown said if you
[1:18:09] have eternal life tonight
[1:18:11] that eternal life and you always was
[1:18:14] eternal you love the lord amen let's bow
[1:18:17] our heads just for a minute before we
[1:18:18] take communion you have the father lord
[1:18:20] we pray that you'd be with each one
[1:18:22] as we come to this place we haven't
[1:18:24] taken communion
[1:18:25] in a couple months lord and we pray that
[1:18:27] you just bless us
[1:18:30] lord give us revelation as we drink this
[1:18:33] wine and
[1:18:35] partake of this bread lord we know
[1:18:38] it's what we do in this dimension
[1:18:41] but when lord we know that it come from
[1:18:43] a heavenly dimension
[1:18:45] where you're sitting now at the right
[1:18:48] hand of the father
[1:18:52] lord but you're down here though in
[1:18:54] spirit form
[1:18:55] in your bride and as we lift that cup up
[1:18:59] and as we lift that bread up lord we
[1:19:01] know that one day
[1:19:05] one day there was nails put in that body
[1:19:09] of yours
[1:19:11] we know that when they lifted you up
[1:19:15] that all the weight of the world crashed
[1:19:17] down on your shoulders when they dropped
[1:19:18] that cross down in that hole
[1:19:22] and there we were your bride
[1:19:27] locked into a dimension of body spirit
[1:19:29] and soul of a man called jesus
[1:19:33] but lord that wasn't the end
[1:19:36] that was only the beginning
[1:19:40] because when you died and you tore your
[1:19:44] life out of that body
[1:19:47] you went to hell and preached the souls
[1:19:49] in prison
[1:19:50] come back up through paradise and pick
[1:19:51] those up lord that we're stuck in those
[1:19:53] dimensions
[1:19:55] the bosom of abraham lord you emptied it
[1:19:57] out and took him to glory with you
[1:19:59] but father you didn't stay there you
[1:20:02] promised lord a few days before
[1:20:04] you went to the crucifixion you promised
[1:20:06] i'll come back
[1:20:08] i'll send the comforter and i will not
[1:20:10] be just with you i'll be in you
[1:20:12] see you couldn't be in the people at the
[1:20:14] time you were walking on the earth
[1:20:16] but lord when you come back on the day
[1:20:17] of pentecost now you can go into any
[1:20:19] believing heart
[1:20:20] of the seven billion people on this
[1:20:23] earth
[1:20:24] today you could enter into every one of
[1:20:26] their soul and give them eternal life
[1:20:29] father i pray that if someone here
[1:20:31] doesn't have
[1:20:33] the new birth lord i pray that you would
[1:20:36] sound a thundering voice in their heart
[1:20:40] say repent and be baptized in the name
[1:20:43] of jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:20:45] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:20:47] holy ghost
[1:20:48] and here we are taking the communion the
[1:20:51] representation of the blood
[1:20:53] and representation of the body that was
[1:20:55] broken for us at calvary
[1:20:57] and lord we know that one day we'll get
[1:21:00] to talk to you and
[1:21:02] you can relay that experience to us
[1:21:03] firsthand
[1:21:05] because the nail scars will still be
[1:21:06] there the nail prints will still be in
[1:21:09] your feet
[1:21:11] but they're there for me so that i can
[1:21:14] come forth in a perfect body
[1:21:16] and have eternal life and be able to
[1:21:18] live
[1:21:20] not have to worry about it in the back
[1:21:22] of our mind have to worry about slipping
[1:21:24] up or
[1:21:24] or messing up or getting a disease or
[1:21:26] being hungry or
[1:21:28] no more of that lord we know too much of
[1:21:30] that as human beings because we live in
[1:21:32] this carnal nature in the carnal mind
[1:21:34] but i pray lord just for a minute now
[1:21:36] that you would
[1:21:39] release that so we can see that
[1:21:42] eternal dimension and people your bride
[1:21:45] can look inside of each other
[1:21:47] we can look inside of ourself and you
[1:21:50] can help us see that what we have
[1:21:52] is you that's brother dale's talking
[1:21:55] about lord the
[1:21:56] fullness of the godhead bodily we all
[1:21:57] have a part we got to play we're part of
[1:21:59] your body
[1:22:00] and we must be made manifest we must be
[1:22:03] made known
[1:22:04] we will be manifest lord on this earth
[1:22:08] father i pray that you'd be with us now
[1:22:09] give us supernatural guidance
[1:22:13] and supernatural faith father for the
[1:22:14] rest of this journey we ask in jesus
[1:22:16] name we pray lord

[1:22:19] lord that you said you sent your word
[1:22:21] and healed them
[1:22:22] we pray that they'll dig deep inside
[1:22:25] brother brown said he said jesus said if
[1:22:28] he was standing right here tonight
[1:22:30] he couldn't heal you he was standing
[1:22:32] right here in a suit of clothes
[1:22:34] he's already healed you before the
[1:22:35] foundation of the world so if any of you
[1:22:37] need healing father
[1:22:38] we pray that you would touch them lord
[1:22:40] and give them strength
[1:22:42] for their journey brother kearn out
[1:22:43] there in the parking lot lord we pray
[1:22:44] that you'd be with him and bless him

[1:22:55] bless each one now in jesus name we ask
[1:22:58] amen let's not forget if he wants to

[1:23:05] if he wants it you gonna give him okay
[1:23:06] good okay all right
[1:23:08] you want to do them
[1:23:11] i was hoping you said that i gotta find
[1:23:13] it i never have that thing marked in my
[1:23:15] bible
[1:23:17] i do have it mark but i gotta find it
[1:23:19] bear with me please
[1:23:24] it's in my old bible and i've got it all
[1:23:25] marked up and i can't find it in this
[1:23:27] one
[1:23:29] but yeah let's give him communion out
[1:23:30] there and uh if his family is out there
[1:23:33] they all out there okay all right
[1:23:41] corinthians
[1:23:45] i took every one of these out of my
[1:23:46] bible okay what is it corinthian oh god
[1:23:49] thank you lord corinthians first
[1:23:51] corinthians 11
[1:23:53] for i have received of the lord that
[1:23:55] which also i delivered unto you that the
[1:23:57] lord jesus the same night in which he
[1:23:58] was betrayed took bread
[1:24:01] you're giving thanks he break it and
[1:24:02] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:24:04] broken for you
[1:24:05] this dude is off because you drink it in
[1:24:07] remembrance of me
[1:24:09] now for the same manner also he took the
[1:24:11] cup and he stopped saying this cup is
[1:24:13] the new testament
[1:24:14] see he hadn't died yet there was no new
[1:24:16] testament that's why you
[1:24:17] we say that and it's and it's true the
[1:24:20] new testament began
[1:24:23] on the day of pentecost when this new
[1:24:26] testament came not the
[1:24:27] regular blood and the and the the wine
[1:24:30] and the
[1:24:30] and the eating of the bread it's when
[1:24:32] christ
[1:24:34] came back on the day of pentecost and
[1:24:35] put his life inside that was a new
[1:24:37] testament
[1:24:38] but the testator had to die first he
[1:24:40] hadn't died yet
[1:24:41] but he's prophesying this cup is the new
[1:24:44] testament
[1:24:45] in my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:24:47] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:24:49] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:24:50] this cup you do show the lord's death
[1:24:52] till he comes wherefore whosoever shall
[1:24:55] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:24:57] lord
[1:24:57] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:24:59] and blood of the lord
[1:25:01] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:25:03] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:25:04] cup
[1:25:06] so i said before let's look look deep
[1:25:08] inside of ourself
[1:25:09] don't look at others look at herself but
[1:25:12] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:25:13] either and drinking damnation unto
[1:25:15] himself not discerning
[1:25:16] now what's the lord's body
[1:25:20] we are okay what's the lord's body
[1:25:24] us for this cause many are weak and
[1:25:26] sickly among you and many sleep
[1:25:28] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:25:31] should not be judged
[1:25:32] if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:25:34] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:25:36] are chastened to the lord that we should
[1:25:38] not be condemned with the world if you
[1:25:40] our condemnation you've passed from
[1:25:41] death into life you're not condemned
[1:25:42] with the world
[1:25:44] cannot will not ever be if you're born
[1:25:47] again
[1:25:47] why because he took your condemnation at
[1:25:49] calvary that's what he's fixing to do
[1:25:51] right here is what he's telling him they
[1:25:52] didn't understand it at the time
[1:25:54] but boy when paul instituted this in
[1:25:56] corinthians
[1:25:57] i believe they understood i know paul
[1:25:59] did
[1:26:00] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:26:02] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:26:03] come together to eat terry one for
[1:26:05] another and if any man hunger led to
[1:26:07] meat at home
[1:26:08] that you come not together into
[1:26:09] condemnation what were they doing they
[1:26:10] were sitting down and eating a regular
[1:26:12] meal and getting drunk the prophet said
[1:26:14] at this communion table but this is not
[1:26:16] it's a solemn time
[1:26:17] because a lot of them down here it says
[1:26:19] that many are weak and sickly among you
[1:26:21] many sleep you make sure that you can
[1:26:22] take this communion
[1:26:24] amen and the rest will i set an order
[1:26:27] when i come let's take a moment of
[1:26:28] silence
[1:26:30] praying one for the other
[1:26:41] thank you for all things jesus name we
[1:26:44] ask
[1:26:45] amen the bible said he took bread and
[1:26:47] blessed it definitely father we thank
[1:26:49] you lord for this bread that's been
[1:26:50] prepared by holy hands
[1:26:52] it's not just been bought at a grocery
[1:26:53] store that anybody and everybody's
[1:26:55] touched but lord has been made according
[1:26:56] to your bible
[1:26:57] so now i pray that as we take this
[1:26:59] communion that we'll understand lord
[1:27:01] that your body was laid stripes and it
[1:27:04] was
[1:27:04] driven holes in it and there was a crown
[1:27:06] of thorns on your head
[1:27:07] lord you look terrible but lord to the
[1:27:10] christian
[1:27:11] it's the most beautiful thing that ever
[1:27:12] happened on earth father we pray that
[1:27:14] you'll just be with us now and let this
[1:27:15] be a sanctification to our body in jesus
[1:27:18] name amen
[1:27:22] you know his legs wasn't broke we know
[1:27:24] that because the bible said he wouldn't
[1:27:25] be
[1:27:27] but he was a broken man when he was on
[1:27:28] calvary he cried father
[1:27:32] why is thou forsaken me in other words
[1:27:34] where's that
[1:27:35] anointing i had before where's that
[1:27:40] where's that peace but he said
[1:27:43] nevertheless
[1:27:44] not my will but i will be done
[1:27:49] he did exactly what he was told to do
[1:27:56] we need to yield ourselves to the same
[1:27:58] thing
[1:28:00] do what he said do
[1:28:05] i used to stand back there a lot of
[1:28:06] times when i was a young kid
[1:28:09] but why in the world these people
[1:28:14] of course being a kid not being a
[1:28:17] christian i thought
[1:28:18] what's that going to do for me
[1:28:22] according to what you wanted to do it's
[1:28:24] according to what you wanted to do
[1:28:26] the heavenly father we pray for this
[1:28:28] wine lord it's
[1:28:30] been made with holy hands and now i pray
[1:28:32] lord that
[1:28:34] as we partake of this as it
[1:28:37] lord ferments and gets better and better
[1:28:39] with age father we know that your bible
[1:28:40] your
[1:28:41] word lord it gets better and better as
[1:28:43] time goes on
[1:28:45] and father we're looking at the time
[1:28:47] that we can get into eternity father
[1:28:48] where
[1:28:50] we can drink this with you there lord in
[1:28:52] that wedding supper lord
[1:28:53] we pray that you just sanctify the
[1:28:55] people bless us now as we take this
[1:28:57] communion in jesus name
[1:28:59] amen amen just take that for
[1:29:02] tell everybody these are disposable
[1:29:06] the ones they're drinking out of are
[1:29:08] disposable so there won't be any
[1:29:09] cross-contamination
[1:29:11] you got bread okay be careful
[1:29:14] god bless you boy i'm glad he's here man
[1:29:16] that makes me feel good
[1:29:18] but i knew you know what
[1:29:22] some will stay home when their cat's
[1:29:23] sick but some will come here
[1:29:25] when their kids are dying asked ryan and
[1:29:29] gabby about that
[1:29:32] how many of you would do that but you
[1:29:35] know what
[1:29:36] kid didn't die kids back there in the
[1:29:39] back
[1:29:41] playing so it's what you
[1:29:44] say to this mountain be moved
[1:29:48] and cast into the sea what you say
[1:29:52] what you have in your heart
[1:29:56] but just think about these things that
[1:29:57] we've been talking about it's
[1:29:59] like with brother dale talking about the
[1:30:01] what you are you're the
[1:30:03] sinless bride of jesus christ and he and
[1:30:06] that was part of the plan see we're not
[1:30:08] out of the plan
[1:30:10] being out of the plan is everything else
[1:30:14] everything else is out of the plan of
[1:30:15] god except god inside of you
[1:30:17] that was his whole plan now sure he's
[1:30:20] got part of the plan where he's going to
[1:30:22] have a foolish virgin he's got part of a
[1:30:23] plan where he's going to have
[1:30:25] people that are given eternal life
[1:30:26] because of of their condition
[1:30:28] that they're born with or the different
[1:30:30] things like or different
[1:30:32] things like that
[1:30:32] down syndrome they're going to be given
[1:30:34] eternal life he's got a place for them
[1:30:36] that's part of his grace and part of his
[1:30:38] plan
[1:30:38] it's part of his plan of the people that
[1:30:40] are going to be given eternal life for
[1:30:41] being good to you
[1:30:43] don't know a thing about god
[1:30:47] i don't want to chance that though for
[1:30:49] john i know too much
[1:30:51] we know too much we got too much going
[1:30:54] on we can't plead
[1:30:56] there was an ignorance offering in the
[1:30:57] bible for people that were ignorant
[1:31:00] that didn't know the customs of the land
[1:31:02] but that ignorance offering wasn't for
[1:31:04] the priest
[1:31:06] they died if they did something wrong it
[1:31:09] wasn't
[1:31:09] it was an ignorance offering for
[1:31:10] somebody the stranger that come in and
[1:31:13] maybe defile something that didn't
[1:31:14] really understand and we know that being
[1:31:17] being young christians we make mistakes
[1:31:20] but now as we grow older paul said the
[1:31:23] things i
[1:31:24] do i would not and all that but he said
[1:31:26] one time he said
[1:31:28] when i was a child i spake as a child
[1:31:31] he said but when i became an adult
[1:31:34] he said i put away my childish things
[1:31:39] they some things that we should not have
[1:31:42] to deal with
[1:31:45] sure we like to drink milk but i don't
[1:31:48] think
[1:31:49] mama's my mama but i don't think she let
[1:31:52] me sit in her lap now
[1:31:54] a little too big for that and she'd be
[1:31:56] telling me grow out boy
[1:31:58] i mean that's what ain't that the way it
[1:31:59] is with god grow up child come on
[1:32:02] get off my knee
[1:32:05] you're growing get up do something
[1:32:09] praise god for yourself amen
[1:32:19] we serve a gracious god that we can even
[1:32:23] do this
[1:32:26] and pray for each other just remember
[1:32:29] what i said
[1:32:30] we love you with the love of the lord we
[1:32:32] just i just want it to be done i'm a
[1:32:34] stickler for doing things right and
[1:32:36] trying to get things done i know i don't
[1:32:37] do it all the time neither does any of
[1:32:39] y'all
[1:32:40] but we try
[1:32:43] and we're held to a different position
[1:32:45] when we got a position
[1:32:47] so just remember that amen god bless you
[1:32:49] take communion
[1:33:02] that's good
[1:33:06] let them go ahead go ahead and take them
[1:33:09] like we're not going to do
[1:33:10] foot washing i'll be glad when we get
[1:33:12] back to foot washing too
[1:33:14] man get all these ordinances back but
[1:33:16] god bless you we love you
[1:33:18] let's just take a second and let them
[1:33:21] get these up and
[1:33:23] like i said thank god for everything you
[1:33:24] do to do though there
[1:33:26] there's um there's an old saying that
[1:33:30] that um 20 of the people do 80
[1:33:34] of the work but that's okay
[1:33:37] that's all right because we need
[1:33:38] everybody right we need everybody to
[1:33:41] come to church
[1:33:44] do their due diligence but what's more
[1:33:46] important folks is to pray before you
[1:33:48] get here
[1:33:50] pray for a service that we can that we
[1:33:52] can break out i'm just waiting any man
[1:33:54] for brother john to take off down that
[1:33:55] aisle
[1:33:56] when he starts singing those songs and
[1:33:59] and i told him i said i'm like brother
[1:34:01] dale i may come out that side door and
[1:34:03] follow you a little bit but
[1:34:04] right and we know that's not everything
[1:34:07] but
[1:34:08] but there's an atmosphere that that you
[1:34:10] bring
[1:34:12] and it's hard to fight it if it don't
[1:34:14] get left at that door right back there
[1:34:17] hey man
[1:34:20] okay all right you want two okay brother
[1:34:23] donnie's gonna get two prayer cloths
[1:34:24] while they're finishing up right there
[1:34:26] will
[1:34:29] put the brother on
[1:34:39] you just put him on him and how many you
[1:34:41] need one
[1:34:43] well i'm gonna give you two
[1:34:50] yes yes ma'am and you know where they go
[1:34:56] see that's something that we that's
[1:34:58] something right there look at what we
[1:34:59] can
[1:35:00] do that has nothing to do with the cloth
[1:35:02] has nothing to do with anything but
[1:35:04] god the faith that we have that god's
[1:35:07] now here with us
[1:35:08] he's not somewhere else he's right here
[1:35:10] with us he don't have to travel to get
[1:35:12] here
[1:35:12] and those prayer cloths wherever they go
[1:35:15] that anointing sure the oil is a symbol
[1:35:19] but us praying over them we we set them
[1:35:21] right here the reason we put them here
[1:35:22] folks and we got
[1:35:23] used to have a big bag of them i think
[1:35:24] we've used a lot of them but that's
[1:35:26] because
[1:35:27] what goes over this pulpit we believe is
[1:35:29] the truth we believe if you come and
[1:35:31] sing a song if you come
[1:35:32] brother john and all the different ones
[1:35:34] coming and and sing
[1:35:36] that you're anointing all this right
