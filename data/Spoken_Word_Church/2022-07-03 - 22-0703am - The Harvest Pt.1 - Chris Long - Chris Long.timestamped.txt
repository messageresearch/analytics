[13:57] i may not look good but i feel good
[14:01] let's just take our bibles and we'll
[14:02] just read a portion of scripture just to
[14:04] get things started it's going to be in
[14:06] saint mark chapter four
[14:08] if you would i have uh
[14:11] i've been kind of preaching on a
[14:14] long-running series but it's it's it's
[14:16] been
[14:17] it's it's got little mini series is in
[14:19] it and it's about the harvest time
[14:22] i believe we're there
[14:24] with all my heart
[14:26] and if you've got saint mark chapter
[14:27] four we'll do verses 26 through 29 and
[14:30] get you seated
[14:32] there's no reason for an introduction
[14:33] you all know me
[14:35] i'm your brother in christ
[14:37] and glad to be so yes amen you got your
[14:40] bibles you ready
[14:42] all right verse 26 and he said
[14:46] so is the kingdom of god as if a man
[14:48] should cast seed into the ground
[14:51] and should sleep
[14:53] and rise night and day and the seed
[14:56] should spring and grow up he knoweth not
[14:58] how
[14:59] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[15:02] herself
[15:03] first the blade
[15:05] then the ear
[15:07] after that the full corn
[15:09] in the ear
[15:11] but when the fruit is brought forth
[15:13] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[15:15] because the harvest
[15:17] is come let's pray father
[15:20] lord this morning
[15:21] just reading a portion of your word lord
[15:23] is is sufficient but father there's
[15:26] something inside of us father that's
[15:28] yearning and longing lord for something
[15:31] more than just the reading of the word
[15:33] lord and that would be father the
[15:35] revelation of it we're asking now that
[15:38] the holy spirit father would be so kind
[15:40] lord and that we could to be in a
[15:43] position to be inviting to you lord to
[15:46] come into our hearts father
[15:49] that we could see father the meaning
[15:52] of your thoughts behind these words
[15:56] always for your honor and your glory
[15:58] lord
[15:59] privilege to be here in jesus christ's
[16:01] name amen god bless you may be seated
[16:05] now
[16:07] i'm not going to do a lot of
[16:09] backgrounding i want everybody to know
[16:11] that in this
[16:13] series i'm calling it i suppose
[16:18] i i was led
[16:21] the way from the beginning of it
[16:23] until recently i i i began to uh see
[16:27] something
[16:29] in the in the in the revelation of these
[16:31] things that um brought me to what you
[16:34] and i have been um
[16:37] have been told is called the tent
[16:40] vision
[16:42] now it's not just a tent vision it's a
[16:45] it's a series of events
[16:48] uh brother branham being taken from one
[16:51] place to another to another he even goes
[16:53] so far as to say he goes from one
[16:56] dimension to another
[16:58] right
[16:59] and and and you might think well that's
[17:01] a strange uh way to to come from the
[17:04] harvest to to a tent uh a vision or this
[17:08] this vision that brother branham speaks
[17:11] about starting in 1956
[17:13] is when he first starts to tell about it
[17:15] but
[17:16] but as i was preaching on harvest and
[17:19] and i started out with uh
[17:21] with the the the former and the latter
[17:24] reign and then somehow god turned me to
[17:28] uh several messages on trying to do god
[17:31] a service without it being his will and
[17:33] of course it seems like well that's odd
[17:35] you know what's that got to do with
[17:37] harvest well
[17:39] you know god does everything
[17:42] mathematically i don't know if you
[17:44] realize that or not but but he is
[17:46] perfected in threes and and um of course
[17:51] as i began to
[17:53] to minister on on the harvest and then
[17:56] the the crop
[17:58] the seed and so forth it
[18:00] it it dawned on me that there was a
[18:02] correlation or there was a connection
[18:05] all right um
[18:07] do you believe we're at harvest time
[18:10] if you don't i want you to turn if you
[18:12] if you're if not if you don't believe it
[18:14] but if you just don't quite see where
[18:16] we're at in time i want you to turn to
[18:19] revelations chapter 14.
[18:22] okay
[18:23] we'll start there
[18:25] um
[18:27] and i'll do the best i can to convey
[18:29] this to you
[18:32] the way the lord give it to me
[18:35] you got revelations 14.
[18:40] verse 14.
[18:44] and i looked and behold wait a minute
[18:46] hold it
[18:47] you got a scofield bible
[18:49] raise your hand
[18:51] what's it say above verse 14.
[18:55] vision
[18:57] and we're talking about a vision now
[19:01] vision of armageddon it says
[19:04] and i looked and behold a white cloud
[19:07] and upon the
[19:08] cloud one sat
[19:12] like unto the son of man
[19:15] having on his head a golden crown and in
[19:17] his hand a sharp sickle
[19:20] and another angel came out of the temple
[19:23] crying with a loud voice to him that sat
[19:25] on the cloud
[19:26] thrust in thy sickle
[19:28] and reap
[19:30] for the time has come for thee to reap
[19:32] for the harvest of the earth is ripe
[19:36] and he that sat on the cloud thrust in
[19:39] his sickle on the earth and the earth
[19:41] was reaped
[19:43] and another angel came out of the temple
[19:45] which is in heaven he also having a
[19:48] sharp sickle and another angel came out
[19:50] from the altar which had power over fire
[19:53] and cried with a loud cry to him that
[19:56] had the sharp sickle saying thrust in
[19:58] thy sharp sickle
[20:00] and gather the clusters of the vine of
[20:02] the earth for her grapes are fully ripe
[20:06] and the angel thrust in his sickle into
[20:09] the earth and gathered the vine of the
[20:11] earth and cast it into the great
[20:13] winepress of the wrath of god and the
[20:15] winepress
[20:17] was trodden without the city
[20:19] and blood came out of the wine press
[20:21] even unto the horse bridles by the space
[20:25] of a thousand and six hundred furlongs
[20:27] now brothers and sisters i read that
[20:29] because i want you to see we are at
[20:32] harvest time we're on the verge of
[20:34] armageddon do you realize that the
[20:36] people the governments of the world and
[20:38] all of these leaders and the military
[20:41] minds are all thinking that this
[20:43] invasion by russia of ukraine is the
[20:46] beginning of armageddon
[20:49] no doubt
[20:51] now there might be there might come a
[20:53] lull
[20:54] there might be there might come a space
[20:56] a time
[20:57] where where superman steps up and says
[21:01] safety
[21:03] the bible tells us when that man does
[21:06] that
[21:06] we're there
[21:08] we're real real close
[21:11] now you say well brother chris i've been
[21:13] hearing that for years
[21:15] but have you been seeing it for years
[21:18] you see modern events are made clear
[21:21] by prophecy
[21:23] so that means that prophecy makes modern
[21:25] events more clear
[21:27] because we're beginning to understand
[21:29] these things and you'd go back maybe if
[21:31] you're uh if you're a follower of the
[21:33] end time message and you and you'd pick
[21:35] up the visions that god gave the prophet
[21:38] back there in the 30s you know how how
[21:40] how
[21:41] getting up to the place where the
[21:42] automobiles would change
[21:44] you can go through all the other ones
[21:45] but let's come right down to the day
[21:47] we're living
[21:48] and he said he saw a family in a vehicle
[21:51] we all know this and it looked like they
[21:54] were playing checkers
[21:55] well he didn't know what a video game
[21:57] was so he just called it checkers
[21:59] and it looked like they were moving
[22:01] things around on this screen and nobody
[22:03] was driving the car
[22:06] oh yeah
[22:07] boy ain't that the truth
[22:09] well ain't nobody driving the car
[22:11] they're busy texting yep
[22:14] see him going all over the road you know
[22:16] from side to side and then the in the
[22:18] rumble strip and my wife says watch out
[22:20] for that one you know they're texting
[22:22] yeah
[22:23] so you kind of hurry by him and you peek
[22:25] over and sure enough they got they got
[22:26] the thing up here on the steering wheel
[22:28] and they got the knee down here and they
[22:30] got their big mac over here and they're
[22:32] doing it anything but driving
[22:37] so we're
[22:38] there we know that the last part of that
[22:41] vision was
[22:43] was a woman
[22:45] and then the united states
[22:49] potholes
[22:51] i hit a few yeah
[22:53] on the highways
[22:55] but these aren't just potholes now these
[22:57] are craters
[22:59] it's coming
[23:00] we're not that far off
[23:03] so then i begin to ponder harvest time
[23:06] it's time for the harvest let's see what
[23:08] the prophet says and i'll and i'll give
[23:10] you uh i'm background in just a little
[23:13] bit
[23:14] but i want you to understand i've been
[23:16] thinking about the crop
[23:18] that's coming up
[23:19] and how that it would be so close at the
[23:22] end that it would deceive the very
[23:23] elected because there are two spirits
[23:25] working
[23:26] right
[23:27] now we'll use all of the different
[23:30] things that god put at our disposal uh
[23:33] by way of a prophet
[23:35] so the first thing i'm going to read to
[23:36] you is out of harvest time
[23:39] there are several places in here
[23:42] where uh the prophet of god gives us
[23:45] some indicators but i want to read you
[23:47] this one first of all here brother
[23:50] branham says he has no idea why he's
[23:52] naming this particular message
[23:55] harvest time
[23:57] but he's going to preach it anyhow
[24:00] he says remember the bible said in the
[24:02] mouth of three witnesses
[24:05] let every word be established
[24:08] we'll get on that in a few minutes on
[24:10] the three temptations of jesus the three
[24:12] temptations of ministers today
[24:15] where they make the fall three
[24:18] temptations of the church and where they
[24:20] make their fall
[24:22] three temptations of an organization
[24:24] where it makes its fall
[24:26] and three temptations in the individuals
[24:30] and where they make their fall
[24:32] now it all runs in threes
[24:35] like justification sanctification
[24:37] baptism of the holy ghost father son
[24:39] holy ghost
[24:41] everything is perfected in threes he
[24:44] says now we all know that but i just
[24:46] want to reinforce that
[24:48] and i want you to notice that when we
[24:49] read out of revelations 14
[24:52] if you follow it close you're gonna see
[24:55] that it's in the mouth
[24:57] of three witnesses
[24:59] this vision of armageddon and what's
[25:01] going to take place all right
[25:04] now
[25:05] what got me now now now i'm gonna i'm
[25:08] gonna move i'm gonna fast forward
[25:11] what got me over here into what we term
[25:14] our title as the tent vision was the
[25:17] definition
[25:19] of harvest
[25:20] so i look it up
[25:22] and again i'm i'm beginning to see
[25:24] something so where i came from from the
[25:28] uh
[25:29] from the from the the former and the
[25:31] latter reign
[25:33] and coming into
[25:34] uh the the trying to do god a service
[25:37] without it being his will was was the
[25:41] was the indication by the prophet that
[25:44] there's a separating time coming
[25:47] now now
[25:49] there's there's this and brother wade
[25:51] and i talk about these things another
[25:53] minute there's this there's this strange
[25:55] ecumenical movement beginning to go on
[25:58] uh maybe you all aren't aware of it and
[26:00] you don't have to be but but i can tell
[26:03] you that there's two spirits
[26:07] and one of them
[26:09] is so
[26:11] close
[26:13] so close
[26:15] that it would deceive the very elected
[26:22] if possible
[26:24] so that's close now
[26:27] so again
[26:28] using that thought i began to think
[26:31] about what the prophet said about the
[26:34] stock
[26:36] the tassel
[26:37] and the shock right now that's the
[26:40] growth
[26:41] of a plant
[26:43] we'll use wheat
[26:46] as our example
[26:48] the bible talks about a corn
[26:51] of wheat no it's not corn and wheat
[26:54] it's a corn of wheat
[26:57] all right
[26:58] corn is another term for germ or grain
[27:02] all right
[27:04] and so
[27:05] pondering these things and meditating
[27:07] and ministering on them and little bits
[27:10] and pieces here and there i get to the
[27:12] word harvest
[27:14] and i notice that
[27:15] what what what the prophet of god i
[27:18] could read it to you right here out of
[27:20] because because people stumble over
[27:22] these things
[27:23] they say well aren't we supposed to be
[27:25] one
[27:26] well
[27:27] yes we are
[27:29] but one
[27:30] with what
[27:32] one in what
[27:34] we're supposed to be
[27:36] one with the word amen so it is the word
[27:42] that does the separating and that's the
[27:45] reason why there was a fall in the
[27:47] garden of eden with the first church
[27:50] eve
[27:53] amen
[27:54] the enemy knew that if he could get the
[27:57] word separated
[28:02] in the mind
[28:04] in the belief
[28:07] in the spirit and heart of that church
[28:10] that we call eve he knew he had a chance
[28:16] and it was an ecumenical separation
[28:20] it's very interesting isn't it that
[28:22] there are all kinds of things in the
[28:24] world today that people are calling
[28:26] antichrist
[28:30] yeah the prophet of god informed us that
[28:32] it has to do with christ
[28:35] or it wouldn't be preceded by the word
[28:37] anti
[28:40] it's got to be because people say well
[28:42] it's the back then the nra and and and
[28:44] today the nra and different nra um
[28:48] okay
[28:49] and and and and and and putin and and
[28:52] and and
[28:53] ching and the guy over in korea and
[28:56] he'd just go all over the place
[29:00] vaccine
[29:02] tattoos
[29:04] you know
[29:06] but we have been given
[29:09] the inside track
[29:13] because we believe god sent a prophet
[29:17] now we may not understand everything
[29:18] that prophet said but we know
[29:21] because of the
[29:23] infallibility not of the man but of the
[29:26] gift that god used through the man
[29:30] that undeniably
[29:32] but there are people that are denying it
[29:36] but to the believer undeniably
[29:40] that man was a man of god
[29:42] yes sir
[29:44] now i want to bring begin to bring a
[29:45] little separation
[29:47] if you let me
[29:50] watch what he says
[29:52] anointed ones at the end time
[29:56] oh you false teachers
[30:00] ouch
[30:02] listen
[30:03] you say well that's
[30:05] that's uh
[30:07] td and this guy and that guy and this
[30:09] guy and esca did it oh no he says
[30:10] listening to these tapes
[30:13] oh
[30:14] now it's brought it home now oh you
[30:17] false teachers listening to these tapes
[30:20] listen now this ain't some guy that just
[30:22] put a tape on for 10 minutes
[30:24] and said that's not that's that's not a
[30:26] god i don't believe that we don't teach
[30:27] that all these years
[30:31] oh you false teachers listen to these
[30:33] tapes all these years
[30:37] come on now
[30:38] this is going to be so close
[30:41] that it would deceive the very elected
[30:44] if possible
[30:46] this is getting real close in it
[30:49] and seeing watch this not just listening
[30:52] and seeing god confirm exactly what he
[30:55] said and you set in your study
[31:01] and no it's the truth oh
[31:05] they know
[31:06] it's the truth
[31:08] they've listened they've seen they've
[31:11] studied this is the truth but because of
[31:14] your denominational differences
[31:21] now i understand the way the way the way
[31:24] folks are because i'm just like you
[31:30] denominational
[31:32] differences
[31:34] what is that
[31:36] you say well that's methodist
[31:38] that's baptist
[31:40] it's presbyterian
[31:42] that's this that's that oh oh oh you
[31:44] have you ever looked up where the word
[31:47] denomination came from
[31:50] you're all assuming it's a church
[31:52] oh no
[31:54] it it comes from a latin root
[31:59] meaning
[32:00] the value
[32:02] of a name
[32:04] right
[32:05] want that to sink in
[32:07] the value
[32:09] of a name
[32:12] that's why you can be a one man or woman
[32:16] denomination
[32:18] in your pew
[32:22] because people will put more value
[32:27] on theirs or someone else's name
[32:31] outside of the name above every name
[32:34] amen
[32:36] what is the name above every name
[32:38] it's the lord jesus christ
[32:42] so then any entity
[32:45] anyone any thought any way
[32:49] any doctrine
[32:51] amen
[32:52] any church
[32:55] any so-called believer
[32:57] who thinks that they have some small
[33:01] alternative idea
[33:04] see i'm putting the heat on now
[33:07] because i'm telling you folks you're
[33:08] looking at a man who believes the
[33:11] infallibility of god's word and the
[33:13] infallibility of the word of god that
[33:16] came through the prophet i didn't say
[33:17] the prophet was infallible
[33:22] i believe jesus christ was infallible
[33:24] but that's because that was the word
[33:27] made flesh
[33:29] right
[33:30] and we are being taught today that we
[33:34] are
[33:35] being put in a position by god
[33:38] to begin to become the same thing that
[33:42] jesus christ was the word made flesh
[33:47] that's why you always hear written
[33:49] epistles read of all men that's what
[33:52] we're supposed to be coming the only way
[33:55] we can do that
[33:56] is by allowing ourselves
[34:00] to fade off the scene
[34:04] and for the word of god to become
[34:06] preeminent
[34:10] through and through
[34:11] amen
[34:14] now it seems like
[34:15] we spend an
[34:17] inordinate amount of time looking at the
[34:21] enemy
[34:22] and his tactics
[34:24] and the negative side i'm reading what
[34:26] the prophet said
[34:28] i'm going to tell you why this is in
[34:29] here and i'm going to tell you why we
[34:31] have to be warned constantly
[34:35] before the fall
[34:38] there was only one warning
[34:41] don't touch that tree
[34:42] amen
[34:44] amen you can do anything you want you
[34:47] can eat anything you want you can go
[34:49] anywhere you want you can fellowship
[34:52] with anybody you want to don't you touch
[34:54] that tree
[34:56] because in the day you week thereof
[34:59] that's the
[35:00] day you die
[35:03] amen
[35:05] but because of the fall
[35:08] and because of the fallen nature
[35:11] that you and i
[35:13] all of us together
[35:14] come into this world through we have to
[35:17] be constantly warned
[35:19] constantly focused
[35:21] constantly told the tactics of the enemy
[35:25] and the enemy today is so close
[35:30] amen
[35:31] so close
[35:33] that it will require
[35:36] the spirit of god and the discernment of
[35:39] god in order to be able to differentiate
[35:42] between friend and foe
[35:47] now we not i'm not preaching a
[35:50] separation from foe the way you think
[35:55] i'm preaching a separation between what
[35:59] made them a foe
[36:01] amen there you go
[36:03] you understand that
[36:05] you know the old saying
[36:07] love the sinner yeah hate the sin yeah
[36:12] you'll get it
[36:13] listen careful
[36:16] all these years seeing god confirm
[36:18] exactly what he said and you said in
[36:20] your study and know it's the truth and
[36:21] because of your denominational
[36:23] differences you dispute them why would a
[36:26] man want to dispute the truth when he
[36:29] knows he sees he hears it's the truth
[36:34] and tell
[36:36] your people
[36:38] they're
[36:39] not so
[36:42] whoa unto you he says your time is close
[36:45] at hand
[36:47] listen
[36:48] balaam
[36:50] people say who
[36:51] bala
[36:53] balaam
[36:54] was a prophet
[36:58] he's there's prophecies still coming to
[37:01] pass we're told
[37:03] that balaam prophesied
[37:06] anointed with the same spirit see how
[37:09] close it is
[37:10] that was upon moses oh girl come on now
[37:13] then then
[37:14] don't you think that
[37:16] with this statement i just read to you
[37:19] that balaam
[37:20] believes he's co-equal
[37:23] with moses
[37:26] how come everybody's listening to what
[37:27] moses said and ain't nobody listening to
[37:29] what i said
[37:32] because your teaching's off babe
[37:34] you are a gifted
[37:36] you're anointed
[37:38] you you you are a man that god can use
[37:42] and has used and will use
[37:47] but you've been taught wrong
[37:51] are you with me
[37:54] the teaching of moses he says what was
[37:56] the difference the teaching of moses was
[37:59] perfect
[38:02] you get that
[38:03] do you believe that say amen amen but
[38:06] moses wasn't perfect
[38:10] moses didn't even get to cross over into
[38:12] the promised land
[38:14] because
[38:17] smote the rock twice
[38:22] bible said here in ii peter that it was
[38:25] the teaching of balaam that israel
[38:27] received
[38:30] that god never did forgive never
[38:34] did
[38:35] forgive what does that mean
[38:38] unpardonable sin
[38:40] ouch
[38:42] no chance
[38:44] not one of them got saved
[38:47] though they had come out under the
[38:48] blessings of god and seen the hand of
[38:50] god moving by this mighty prophet and
[38:53] seen it exactly vindicated by god and
[38:56] because another prophet come in with a
[38:58] teaching contrary and disputed with
[39:00] moses and tried to prove to the people
[39:02] that moses was wrong
[39:07] can't you see brothers and sisters we're
[39:09] here
[39:11] we're at the harvest time
[39:15] well i want to take you a little deeper
[39:16] into the harvest
[39:18] if you let me
[39:20] through god's word
[39:23] dathan gore and many of them agreed with
[39:25] him
[39:26] listen agreed
[39:29] with him
[39:31] and taught the children of israel to
[39:33] commit fornications
[39:35] there's another portion of a message i
[39:37] preached during this series called the
[39:40] oxen
[39:41] stumbled
[39:45] trying to do god a service without it
[39:47] being his will the ox and stumbled does
[39:49] anybody in the room know what the ox is
[39:52] a type of
[39:54] pastors
[39:59] the oxen stumbled and it caused an
[40:02] innocent man who saw it happening to try
[40:06] to
[40:06] to try to level up and and and steady
[40:09] the cart
[40:13] the cart was wrong too
[40:17] you understand that's what's going on
[40:20] that the two spirits would be so close
[40:22] it would deceive the very elected so the
[40:24] oxen are correct but they were not the
[40:28] things that god chose to move that ark
[40:35] that's why there's a pastoral breakdown
[40:37] going on why because they're stumbling
[40:42] why are they stumbling because they were
[40:45] not ordained
[40:47] to carry that word it was god's selected
[40:53] elected ministry that he hath placed and
[40:57] chose
[40:58] and if it is god's ministry they will
[41:02] not try to do something with the word of
[41:05] god
[41:07] out of place yes right amen they will
[41:10] not try to do god a service
[41:12] without it being his will they will
[41:15] endeavor to do everything they can for
[41:17] the lord
[41:18] in his
[41:20] will
[41:22] and what is his will
[41:26] oh that's see i i get comfort there yeah
[41:29] i feel good do you do you feel good
[41:31] if you've got if you get your comfort
[41:33] from god's word right now you're saying
[41:36] praise the lord
[41:38] you know kind of like that woman that
[41:40] come out there and say oh praise the
[41:41] lord brother branham
[41:44] you get everything tonight
[41:48] and she walked off and one man said yeah
[41:50] you hit everything but gossip yeah
[41:54] because she's the biggest gossiper in
[41:55] the church see
[41:57] so brothers that's why it was good
[41:59] little little message we heard this
[42:01] morning from brother aaron see
[42:03] i'll be checking up all the time
[42:06] now you don't have to constantly be
[42:07] running back the blood of jesus christ
[42:09] let me tell you it's so powerful right
[42:11] amen now when i first got saved i'm
[42:13] telling them this is this is a true
[42:15] story i had a binder paper and several
[42:18] uh
[42:19] notes in a notebook
[42:21] long and i come to the pastor about a
[42:23] week later and i said sir i said i've
[42:25] got to make some things right
[42:29] he looked at the i mean i'm not kidding
[42:31] this happened in his office he's looking
[42:33] at the list and he's
[42:35] wow
[42:36] man you're going to prison
[42:38] that's what he said
[42:40] he said you you try to do you try to
[42:41] make all this up you go into prison
[42:45] and i said well
[42:46] i feel in my heart that i should go back
[42:48] and make everything right i'm going to
[42:49] tell you he did have some wisdom
[42:53] let me pass it along to you
[42:58] he said brother
[43:00] he said the blood of jesus christ
[43:03] so powerful
[43:05] that everything you got written down on
[43:06] there
[43:08] is white as snow
[43:11] he said but if you listen thank you
[43:13] if you listen to the message future home
[43:16] he says you're going to find out that
[43:18] that just took care of the past sins
[43:19] what you're doing today brother that's
[43:21] it
[43:23] now you got to start making it right
[43:26] everything you did before let it go
[43:30] the blood of jesus christ is that
[43:32] powerful and it continues to be that
[43:34] powerful
[43:35] but now you got to make it right
[43:43] i haven't even got to the definition of
[43:45] harvest yet but i'm working there
[43:47] let me let me get this let me get this
[43:49] out of the way
[43:51] listen close
[43:52] nathan corey many of them agreed with
[43:53] him they agreed with balaam and taught
[43:56] the children of israel to commit
[43:57] fornications to go after
[44:00] his
[44:01] organization that's committing
[44:03] fornication
[44:06] that we're all the same
[44:10] think about it think about the mantra
[44:14] that's going on today
[44:16] oh come on we're all the same well if
[44:18] there's nothing wrong with shaking a
[44:20] hand and giving a hug and going out to
[44:22] lunch
[44:23] but we're not all the same
[44:26] some of us are going to stand on every
[44:29] word of god no matter what the cost no
[44:32] matter what our family says no matter
[44:34] what our church says no matter what our
[44:37] co-workers say no matter what the
[44:39] government says
[44:41] we're gonna stand
[44:43] and there's a price to pay amen for
[44:45] standing right amen did you realize that
[44:48] it took our lord to calvary
[44:51] [Music]
[44:53] amen
[44:54] listen to what he says we are not the
[44:57] same whether we're methodist baptist
[44:58] presbyterian or pentecostals or what
[45:00] more we're all the same we are not
[45:03] the same
[45:05] listen now you are a separated people
[45:11] holy unto the lord
[45:13] dedicated to the word and the spirit of
[45:16] god to bear fruit
[45:18] now we're at harvest time
[45:20] to bear fruit of his promise of this day
[45:26] you say brother chris what is the
[45:28] promise of this day
[45:32] power of god chicago illinois 10 6-55
[45:36] what is it
[45:38] a revelation amen what is faith
[45:42] listen now listen to the definition the
[45:44] prophet of god gives of faith
[45:46] is
[45:47] god
[45:48] what is faith is
[45:50] god
[45:52] i like the start of this definition
[45:55] by the spirit
[45:57] revealing to you something that he's
[46:01] going to do
[46:03] or he's promised that's it
[46:06] that becomes brothers and sisters
[46:08] whether you realize it or not the fruit
[46:11] amen of this harvest
[46:14] because because faith
[46:16] is based upon those things that you
[46:19] cannot see
[46:21] hebrews 11. you can't see them
[46:24] but yet you believe they exist in such a
[46:28] way where they're actually tangible
[46:31] i could feel it
[46:33] yeah but i can't see it you don't got to
[46:35] see it with these eyes
[46:37] you got to see it with something in here
[46:39] what is that that is the fruit
[46:44] of the harvest
[46:46] it's the fruit
[46:48] off of the tree
[46:50] of life
[46:51] you see the tree of knowledge of good
[46:53] and evil requires tangibility
[46:57] something you can see taste feel smell
[47:01] hear and once you can do that then
[47:03] reason affection
[47:05] memory
[47:06] conscience and so forth begins to enter
[47:08] in
[47:10] but if you take god at his word
[47:13] now i've probably said this here before
[47:15] and i'm going to say it again because
[47:16] it's just come to me
[47:18] you know how the devil got even the
[47:20] garden of eden the devil got even the
[47:23] garden of eden
[47:24] by asking her
[47:26] where
[47:27] is your fruit
[47:29] you see i've been procreating here for
[47:31] quite some time young lady and look at
[47:34] my family but i don't see your family
[47:36] and god's word says
[47:39] replenish and multiply where are you
[47:42] doing it
[47:46] like wendy bagwell
[47:51] eve lost your faith
[47:58] she didn't realize
[48:00] that everything is predicated on
[48:03] listen now
[48:05] revealing to you
[48:08] something
[48:09] listen the way he says it
[48:11] not that he's doing
[48:14] something that he's going
[48:16] to do
[48:18] or that he's promised
[48:20] amen
[48:22] and we live in a most impatient world
[48:27] nobody can wait on nothing
[48:31] it's harvest
[48:32] time amen
[48:34] notice the bible declares
[48:36] that the first thing that's harvested is
[48:38] not the wheat
[48:42] it's the tares
[48:45] and how
[48:47] are the terrors
[48:48] harvested
[48:50] by gathering
[48:52] together
[48:54] we're all the same brother come on join
[48:57] up with us
[48:59] let's sit around the table and gnosh on
[49:01] this a little while
[49:02] and let's try to figure out
[49:06] what he meant
[49:07] by what he said
[49:10] i don't need to know that
[49:12] i need to know the author
[49:14] amen and once you know the author you
[49:16] already know what he meant by what he
[49:19] said because you are in the author
[49:23] you don't have to guess
[49:25] it's not like a a drama that they put
[49:27] together for you to run down and spend
[49:29] 20 bucks on
[49:31] that's the popcorn it's only eight
[49:33] dollars to see the drama it's 20 for the
[49:35] popcorn
[49:37] catch it yes
[49:42] and you got to try to sit there and
[49:43] figure out hmm
[49:46] who's guilty
[49:47] who's the bad guy who's the good guy
[49:49] it's it look at the beginning it looks
[49:51] obvious huh oh there's the bad guy
[49:53] there's a good guy by the end of the
[49:54] thing you
[49:55] the good guy's the bad guy the bad guy's
[49:57] a good guy yeah all right
[50:01] what do you think they got that
[50:02] inspiration
[50:06] they called jesus the bad guy
[50:08] bells above
[50:11] right
[50:13] he ain't nothing but a devil a sorcerer
[50:16] where where is he getting this authority
[50:18] in this paul from
[50:21] he looked like the bad guy didn't he
[50:24] guess what at the end
[50:26] he's the good guy
[50:28] thank the lord do you realize that yeah
[50:30] man that was right but how is he doing
[50:33] it
[50:34] through his mystical body
[50:37] which is you this
[50:40] represented by the bride of jesus christ
[50:44] and you say well brother you just read
[50:46] me a scripture there in revelations 14 1
[50:48] like unto the son of man i sure did
[50:53] did you realize what the prophet taught
[50:55] us
[50:56] with that statement
[50:58] one like unto the son of man is not the
[51:01] son of man
[51:04] let me clear it up for you he said
[51:06] that's his bride
[51:09] and you say well brother it looks like a
[51:11] man
[51:12] don't she
[51:14] yes
[51:14] amen because these two
[51:17] shall be one flesh let us make man in
[51:19] our image and after our likeness and he
[51:21] made that man both yeah amen male and
[51:25] female so it don't look like a woman
[51:29] because the bride is in him amen
[51:31] amen it looks like him amen that cloud
[51:36] that appeared in arizona in 1963
[51:40] is one like unto the son of man amen
[51:43] amen
[51:45] he said well looks like the son of man
[51:46] to me it better
[51:51] still with me
[51:52] oh man i better hurry i'm watching the
[51:54] clock now
[51:56] you're separated people do you get that
[51:58] okay all right so i'm gonna put that
[52:00] aside
[52:04] because i still want to get to harvest
[52:08] still with me
[52:10] now i'm going to read one other thing to
[52:11] you out of harvest time
[52:13] because
[52:15] i began to think about the seed
[52:18] and then lo and behold if the lord
[52:19] didn't bring to my attention
[52:22] an article
[52:25] on the wheat
[52:28] now watch where the prophet goes i can
[52:30] read you all this but i'm just going to
[52:32] begin to
[52:33] to quote to you
[52:35] and you can go look it up but most of
[52:37] you know these things
[52:40] so the stalk of the plant
[52:44] was martin luther's
[52:47] dispensation
[52:49] right
[52:50] the just
[52:51] shelled by faith
[52:53] and then the tussle
[52:56] was john wesley's dispensation
[52:59] and it had to do with sanctification
[53:02] right
[53:03] and then the shock
[53:06] the third stage of the stock the carrier
[53:10] listen now the carrier of the life
[53:15] so nobody can dispute that it was not
[53:19] the life of god through jesus christ
[53:23] traveling
[53:24] through those stages or dispensations
[53:29] but it wasn't jesus christ
[53:32] it was the carrier of the life
[53:35] coming up
[53:36] through the stalk the torso and the
[53:38] shock is that right
[53:40] now listen to what brother branham says
[53:42] because there's one stage
[53:44] after the shock that most people are
[53:48] unfortunately deceived by right brother
[53:53] and that's the grain
[53:55] you say how could the grain
[53:58] be deceiving
[54:00] because people are mistaking the grain
[54:03] and the shock
[54:05] one for the other is that right now
[54:09] brother branham preached messages like
[54:10] three exoduses
[54:12] he's perfected in threes
[54:14] but he always said if god is gonna take
[54:17] you out of something he's got a place
[54:20] for you to
[54:22] go so therefore
[54:25] the life that traveled up those stages
[54:29] into the shuck which is the pentecostal
[54:32] age had to have a place to go
[54:37] it didn't stop there
[54:39] but brother branham said if you don't
[54:40] have a real good trained eye you see it
[54:43] matters who teaches you if you're not
[54:45] tight right you're gonna pull back
[54:48] a part of that plant you're gonna open
[54:51] up the pages
[54:54] of god's word and say that's it
[54:59] no
[55:00] that's the shock
[55:02] no but brother it looks just like the
[55:05] seed sure it does
[55:08] it would be so close
[55:10] now i realized there were light years
[55:13] people think past the pentecostal age
[55:15] but these denominational differences are
[55:18] still with us
[55:20] people still trying to decide do i have
[55:22] it
[55:24] do they have it
[55:27] does he have it
[55:29] does she have it
[55:30] do i got it
[55:33] and if you listen
[55:38] to the alternative
[55:41] yeah
[55:42] you ain't got it that's right
[55:44] there you go even if you think
[55:46] you got it right you ain't got it
[55:49] because this is only one life amen
[55:51] there's only one god amen right
[55:54] man
[55:55] is that right
[55:56] listen close now
[55:59] look this is out of harvest time again
[56:01] hurrying there must come
[56:04] a true seed
[56:05] amen there must come a true seed
[56:10] there has just got to be because he's
[56:12] coming for the bride without spot or
[56:15] wrinkle he's coming for it a word
[56:18] vindicated bride praise the lord a word
[56:21] vindicated bro
[56:23] because the prophet of god taught us
[56:25] that signs wonders and miracles should
[56:28] follow the believer but they're not an
[56:31] exact and true and pure indicator
[56:35] because janice and jabras
[56:38] can mimic
[56:39] can
[56:42] impersonate think about it
[56:45] moses said flies
[56:48] where did they come from
[56:50] they come from
[56:52] the words of god through moses
[56:55] they come into existence i don't care
[56:58] what science says they've been with us
[57:01] for trillions of years sure they have
[57:02] been in the mind of god all the time
[57:05] but the manifestation of them
[57:08] showed up in the days of moses so
[57:10] wouldn't it be simple wouldn't it be
[57:12] simple if moses if you knew moses had
[57:14] the creative power of god's word working
[57:16] through him and moses said flies you
[57:18] could run over here and say flies
[57:22] flies are going to show up oh yeah sure
[57:25] not because you said it
[57:27] because moses already said it all right
[57:30] so now you're becoming what they call a
[57:31] parrot
[57:32] an impersonator
[57:34] a mimic but because people don't realize
[57:38] there's a separation
[57:43] they think
[57:44] this guy's got it
[57:46] he said it too
[57:48] he said flies i see flies
[57:50] but do you realize where they came from
[57:54] they came from the voice of god
[57:58] through moses
[58:00] still with me
[58:02] okay
[58:05] he's coming forward a word vindicated
[58:07] right oh listen now she'll be such a
[58:10] little
[58:11] bitty
[58:12] group all right
[58:15] do i need to say that again
[58:17] come on now
[58:19] it'll be such a little bitty
[58:23] group
[58:27] how big was jesus church
[58:29] who was jesus
[58:31] god manifest in the flesh how many
[58:34] people did god manifest in the flesh
[58:37] have in his church
[58:39] oh thousands only
[58:42] when he was healing yeah
[58:44] only when he was feeding
[58:48] but when he got down to the word
[58:51] lest you eat the flesh of the son of man
[58:53] and drink his blood you have no life in
[58:56] you oh we can't handle that i'm going to
[58:59] tell you what them 70 ministers did the
[59:02] ministerial association brother branham
[59:04] called them i'm going to tell you
[59:05] exactly what they did they did exactly
[59:08] like
[59:09] janice and jeffrey
[59:11] they heard jesus say unless you eat the
[59:13] flesh and drink the blood of the son of
[59:15] man you have no life in you and they say
[59:17] we can't take that it's a hard saying
[59:19] they go over here and preach it yeah
[59:21] right preaching it because they because
[59:22] see it's the words of life and that's
[59:25] the only place life comes from
[59:28] is god's word so they would have to
[59:30] preach a form of what was said by god in
[59:35] order to gather anything all right
[59:39] you're with me in order to gather
[59:41] anything right
[59:44] so you see brothers and sisters it's the
[59:46] very reason why i see there is the need
[59:49] for a separation but it's not you and me
[59:51] doing the separating it's not our
[59:53] churches or our pastors or the ministry
[59:55] it's the word of god
[59:59] and the reason it's the word of god
[1:00:01] right now is because it's harvest time
[1:00:06] and the word harvest
[1:00:08] comes from a root word i just looked it
[1:00:11] up in the dictionary i'm no rocket
[1:00:12] scientist to cut
[1:00:15] to shear
[1:00:16] to separate
[1:00:18] think about it that's what harvest is
[1:00:20] it's to separate the grain from the rest
[1:00:25] of the plant that carried the life but
[1:00:27] yet is going to die in the field and if
[1:00:29] the grain stays with it the grain is
[1:00:32] going to die with it so the grain has to
[1:00:35] be elevated that's why they call it a
[1:00:37] grain elevator it has to be elevated and
[1:00:39] that's why we're in rapture time because
[1:00:42] we've got to be elevated the grain has
[1:00:44] got to be plucked and then elevated
[1:00:46] who's doing the plucking
[1:00:49] if i take you to matthew 13 right now
[1:00:51] and i read to you out of your bible
[1:00:55] what the bible says
[1:00:57] about the reap the harvest and the
[1:01:00] reapers
[1:01:01] and you don't have to believe me but if
[1:01:03] you don't you better go look it up
[1:01:05] that's right you can go outside today
[1:01:07] and say that brother's office rocker
[1:01:09] well i challenge you to look it up
[1:01:14] matthew 13
[1:01:15] verse 37 he answered and said unto them
[1:01:17] he that soweth the good seed now what
[1:01:19] did i just read to you brother brahm
[1:01:21] said there must come a true seed amen
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:24] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[1:01:26] of man
[1:01:28] this ain't one life the son of man now
[1:01:29] this is the son of man sowing the seed
[1:01:32] now brother adam tells us in anointed
[1:01:34] ones at the end time he is not the son
[1:01:36] of man he's representing the son of man
[1:01:43] the field
[1:01:45] is the world what does the word world
[1:01:48] mean cosmos not the earth not the planet
[1:01:51] not the globe cosmos means the way
[1:01:55] things
[1:01:56] are
[1:01:58] the way things are done
[1:02:00] the field is the world the good seed oh
[1:02:03] i like this
[1:02:04] he says the truth seed's coming the good
[1:02:07] seed
[1:02:08] are the children of the kingdom do you
[1:02:11] realize you're the good seed
[1:02:14] if you're a child of the kingdom
[1:02:19] as brother daryl word would say that'd
[1:02:21] make a methodist shout now come on
[1:02:22] that's right are you the good seed or
[1:02:25] not
[1:02:28] you need to understand that you're this
[1:02:31] good seed
[1:02:34] if there's a question in your mind get
[1:02:36] rid of it amen
[1:02:39] separate
[1:02:40] from it
[1:02:42] see
[1:02:42] there's the separation coming here
[1:02:45] field is the world the good seat of the
[1:02:47] children of the kingdom but the tares
[1:02:49] you know the weeds
[1:02:51] are the children of the wicked one
[1:02:55] the enemy that sold them is the devil
[1:02:59] the harvest
[1:03:00] is the end of the world the harvest the
[1:03:04] separation is the end of the world can't
[1:03:06] you see it going on our nation is being
[1:03:09] separated beliefs and and that the way
[1:03:12] people see things is separating people i
[1:03:15] just read this morning a headline that
[1:03:17] says this nation is full of hatred
[1:03:22] think about it
[1:03:25] do you either believe it our way
[1:03:28] amen i will riot
[1:03:33] you don't see the real true
[1:03:36] genuine christians saying that
[1:03:39] but they understand
[1:03:41] you need to believe it our way
[1:03:44] because it's his way
[1:03:46] it's not my way it's not your way it's
[1:03:49] his way but we don't i don't carry a
[1:03:53] a banner
[1:03:56] i carry a life
[1:03:58] you say well i'm just one person and and
[1:04:01] i want to i want to get it out there
[1:04:04] i'll be careful
[1:04:07] i'll be careful speaking against the
[1:04:08] internet
[1:04:11] i know how some of you feel
[1:04:13] let me tell you folks something
[1:04:17] the internet
[1:04:19] these smartphones
[1:04:21] these tablets
[1:04:23] crypto
[1:04:25] all this cyber
[1:04:27] guess what it is
[1:04:29] it's technology
[1:04:31] that come from god's laboratory but not
[1:04:34] so that we could carry a gadget in our
[1:04:37] pocket to access it
[1:04:44] i'll just cut loose on you
[1:04:46] go ahead
[1:04:47] this technology that science has tapped
[1:04:49] into
[1:04:50] listen close now
[1:04:52] is lucifer's way of getting people to
[1:04:55] think that he is omnipresent
[1:05:02] think about it let it sink in
[1:05:04] i can get my phone out of that office
[1:05:07] right now and i can whatsapp
[1:05:11] somebody in africa
[1:05:13] facetime
[1:05:15] looks omnipresent
[1:05:17] looks like they're here
[1:05:19] and we're there
[1:05:21] but that's not the god we serve
[1:05:23] right now he's here
[1:05:25] right now right amen that's right he's
[1:05:28] there
[1:05:29] right now
[1:05:30] and he don't have to use the cellular
[1:05:32] waves he don't need a gadget
[1:05:37] his spirit
[1:05:38] does it don't you see how much further
[1:05:41] along we should be
[1:05:43] we should be so much further along than
[1:05:46] this mickey mouse internet ain't working
[1:05:49] today technology
[1:05:52] amen you need something from the lord
[1:05:55] you just begin to meditate
[1:05:58] on the lord
[1:06:00] guess what
[1:06:02] without a gadget
[1:06:04] he shows up
[1:06:06] amen i like it
[1:06:08] and he can show up at your house and at
[1:06:10] the same time show up at that house in
[1:06:12] that house that state that town that
[1:06:14] country right amen
[1:06:22] don't you understand brothers and
[1:06:23] sisters i'm not talking down technology
[1:06:26] we use automobiles they kill more people
[1:06:31] a gun wasn't invented to kill the first
[1:06:33] victim a rock was
[1:06:36] that's what cain used to kill abel with
[1:06:39] and they want us all to go back to rocks
[1:06:44] they'll still kill yeah
[1:06:46] you take the guns and the knives and the
[1:06:48] scissors and the forks out of the hands
[1:06:49] of the people and if they get sideways
[1:06:51] they'll find a rock
[1:06:58] what's my time limit brother i'm going
[1:06:59] to stop when my time's up
[1:07:05] i guess when you stand up and wave your
[1:07:07] arms
[1:07:09] i'm good
[1:07:11] you remember when i first come here i
[1:07:14] couldn't go 30 minutes
[1:07:16] and i've been preaching for years
[1:07:18] 30 minutes long
[1:07:20] oh brother you can't shut me down now
[1:07:24] because the word of god i found out i
[1:07:26] always knew it but i found out it's
[1:07:27] eternal there is no beginning and there
[1:07:30] is no end where are you going to stop
[1:07:32] where you're going to start you just
[1:07:33] kind of got to get on the trolley and
[1:07:35] ride
[1:07:37] right listen now we're still in matthew
[1:07:39] 13 the enemy that sowed them is the
[1:07:40] devil the harvest is the end of the
[1:07:42] world listen now and the reapers are the
[1:07:45] angels i want you to know there are many
[1:07:47] different kinds of angels so i looked up
[1:07:50] this word angel here in matthew 13 and
[1:07:54] you're going to be blown away what it
[1:07:56] means
[1:07:57] it's the very reason why the oxen have
[1:08:00] stumbled
[1:08:04] in the strong's concordance
[1:08:06] found under this use of the word angel
[1:08:10] it says
[1:08:12] to bring
[1:08:13] tidings
[1:08:15] a messenger
[1:08:17] especially an angel
[1:08:20] by implying a pastor
[1:08:23] i didn't make this up i looked it up and
[1:08:25] i was blown away when i said that i said
[1:08:28] that makes perfect sense to me
[1:08:30] because it is the local sovereignty of
[1:08:33] god in the local church using the
[1:08:36] ministry in that church
[1:08:39] to harvest you amen
[1:08:43] so that makes this post of duty a reaper
[1:08:47] but not a grim reaper
[1:08:49] we don't have a hoodie on
[1:08:51] we don't have a sickle or a scattered or
[1:08:53] whatever you want to call it in our
[1:08:54] hands
[1:08:56] we got life amen not death
[1:08:59] we're not reaping for death we're
[1:09:01] reaping for life
[1:09:04] and brothers and sisters whether you
[1:09:05] realize it or not
[1:09:07] everybody that passes away before
[1:09:11] the fulfillment of first thessalonians
[1:09:14] was supposed to yeah right amen
[1:09:17] amen brother wade and i talking and
[1:09:19] brother
[1:09:23] about the young couple that my son and
[1:09:25] daughter-in-law lived with just before
[1:09:27] they blew up in their house over there
[1:09:29] in ohio
[1:09:31] well i believe they're saved sure amen
[1:09:34] and it's up to god whether they're
[1:09:35] bright or not and i believe they're
[1:09:36] bright
[1:09:38] but guess what
[1:09:39] they were not supposed to be here i know
[1:09:42] that sounds cruel but they were not
[1:09:44] supposed to be here some of us may pass
[1:09:46] along and we were not supposed to be
[1:09:48] here to fulfill this scripture
[1:09:50] those which are alive and remain
[1:09:54] it's only gonna be an exact amount of
[1:09:57] people
[1:09:58] i mean to the letter
[1:10:02] we love those people and they're pulling
[1:10:03] for us do you realize that they without
[1:10:05] us cannot be made perfect
[1:10:08] and perfect
[1:10:10] is mature
[1:10:11] so it's going to require excuse me uh
[1:10:14] mature grain
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:21] okay i've made my decision
[1:10:23] i'm going all the way
[1:10:25] [Laughter]
[1:10:28] but i ain't going all the way with this
[1:10:30] morning's message but i'm going all the
[1:10:31] way hey man
[1:10:32] okay that's one of my favorite little
[1:10:35] songs
[1:10:36] made my decision
[1:10:39] really going all the way
[1:10:42] thank you
[1:10:44] i'll finish the definition of harvest
[1:10:48] and i'll stop
[1:10:51] because i got this afternoon
[1:10:53] and he said i had more time
[1:10:56] listen to the definition from the
[1:10:58] dictionary i gave you where the the root
[1:11:00] of the word harvest came from
[1:11:03] to to cut to sheer to separate
[1:11:07] now these first two definitions in the
[1:11:10] dictionary and it was only three long
[1:11:12] sound familiar to us the time of the
[1:11:15] year
[1:11:16] when matured grain not immature not
[1:11:19] almost matured but matured grain
[1:11:23] fruit
[1:11:24] vegetables etc are ripped and
[1:11:28] gathered
[1:11:29] in not just raped and gathered
[1:11:32] in
[1:11:33] a season's yield of the same meaning the
[1:11:38] crop itself is also the harvest
[1:11:41] so the harvest is not just the reaping
[1:11:43] and the gathering it's also the gathered
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:47] right
[1:11:49] the gathering in of a crop now this is
[1:11:51] where i got by the way this is this is
[1:11:53] what launched me into
[1:11:56] the tent vision amen
[1:11:58] i could see now that the tint vision has
[1:12:00] been you know um if i use the word
[1:12:03] disputed it would be accurate
[1:12:06] if i use the word uh various and
[1:12:09] different interpretations i would be
[1:12:11] accurate
[1:12:12] if i you understand and then of course
[1:12:15] and and being kind and nice there's all
[1:12:17] kinds of interpretations of it most of
[1:12:20] them require william branham to return
[1:12:24] all right
[1:12:26] okay
[1:12:27] i'm not separating from them folks
[1:12:30] some of them of our best friends
[1:12:33] grew up with them
[1:12:34] known them for 40-plus years not not
[1:12:37] impugning
[1:12:39] not disputing
[1:12:42] but i'm here to tell you this morning
[1:12:43] brothers and sisters
[1:12:46] that the revelation is lacking
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:53] because faith is something he's going to
[1:12:55] do not something he's already done amen
[1:12:58] man
[1:13:00] faith is based upon a promise
[1:13:02] that is pulling you forward
[1:13:05] because it has not been fulfilled
[1:13:09] yet
[1:13:10] and it's and it's it's like a magnet
[1:13:12] drawing and drawing and drawing the
[1:13:15] believer i can see people are getting
[1:13:17] uncomfortable i better hurry
[1:13:20] listen to the third definition and right
[1:13:22] away when i read this i said that's it
[1:13:25] i know now that
[1:13:26] there's two ways that a vision
[1:13:30] is interpreted
[1:13:33] god sends a prophet a major prophet a
[1:13:37] gifted man that god's gonna talk through
[1:13:39] and he tells him give them
[1:13:42] yeah right
[1:13:43] my interpretation not the prophet gods
[1:13:46] give them
[1:13:47] right is that right
[1:13:49] what's the other one
[1:13:51] by it coming
[1:13:53] to pass
[1:13:55] but you still have to recognize the
[1:13:58] meaning of it in order to catch the
[1:14:00] coming to pass
[1:14:02] oh it's happening
[1:14:04] it's harvest time i'll tell you that
[1:14:05] right now the train's coming
[1:14:09] to pick us up
[1:14:11] telling you
[1:14:13] listen to this
[1:14:16] harvest
[1:14:17] the outcome
[1:14:20] or consequences
[1:14:25] the outcome
[1:14:27] or
[1:14:28] consequences of any
[1:14:31] effort
[1:14:33] or series of events
[1:14:36] as soon as i read that brother white i
[1:14:38] said that's the tent vision it's a
[1:14:40] series of events that take brother
[1:14:43] branham from the little brown children
[1:14:46] which he says in the present stage of my
[1:14:48] ministry was fulfilled in mexico city
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] all the way
[1:14:55] to the little room amen
[1:14:58] yes
[1:15:00] you remember that
[1:15:02] i ain't got time to read it to you this
[1:15:03] afternoon i'll do that
[1:15:06] but i want to take you to the portion
[1:15:10] of the tint series that i had left off
[1:15:14] at home
[1:15:15] and that is
[1:15:18] that little room
[1:15:19] there's something very significant
[1:15:23] about that little room
[1:15:27] and the angel of the lord in closing
[1:15:29] told brother branham
[1:15:30] it's always
[1:15:32] scriptural
[1:15:34] always
[1:15:36] scriptural no matter what we think
[1:15:38] no matter what the prophets you know the
[1:15:40] prophet didn't understand many of those
[1:15:41] things i'll tell you he said i didn't
[1:15:43] understand those fish
[1:15:45] i didn't understand this i didn't
[1:15:47] understand that he said i didn't
[1:15:49] understand that little room he says that
[1:15:51] i'll read it to you
[1:15:54] but when the angel is beginning to give
[1:15:57] brother branham
[1:15:59] the interpretation
[1:16:02] of that little room
[1:16:04] he mentions
[1:16:06] a door
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:09] and that's where we'll take you hey this
