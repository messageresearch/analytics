TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in Jesus name amen you be seated also a quick announcement here the Memorial Day meetings for the Christian Assembly of Ohatchee that's on May 26th 27th at 7 pm and May 28th at 10 A.M I'll leave this paper up here for anyone who wants to refer to that and the nursing home meeting for brother Hal Thomas is at The Landings of Gainesville 2030 Windward Lane would be this coming this coming Saturday right yeah and uh on the 29th at 2PM just remember that okay and we have a little lesson here for you all this morning brother Bob had asked me to teach because he was going to be out of town but then he wound up being here but he told me to go and teach anyway so okay so we're going to teach a lesson here on the great playwright and y'all know who I'm referring to her by the picture and the fact that it's the great is the great playwright so for a definition if you don't know what a playwright is it's a person who writes plays I don't know if anybody here did not know that person runs plays okay so a drama is a play for theater radio or television and exciting emotional or unexpected series of events or set of circumstances and part of God's character is dramatic I want to give a few disclaimers here right up front there's a few things I'm not saying in this lesson I'm not talking about God being dramatic in that like he likes to strip drama for no purpose like some instigator in your family everybody's got this person in their family that likes to trouble and cause that kind of drama I don't talk about that kind of drama talking about the type of drama that has purpose that has a part in revealing the character of God so part of his character is dramatic he loves to write and act out plays in the lives of people this is evident in the lives of Bible characters as well as in our lives today we are not there's more disclaimers here I don't want anybody walk away with the wrong wrong idea we are not puppets in this play God gives us free choice has been thoroughly covered recently by Brother Wade and brother Bob on his last Sunday school lesson and both Chris long we've heard it mentioned I think everybody here agrees with that I I agree with it full heart wholeheartedly I don't believe we're puppets and that God's a puppeteer making things happen this play took place in his mind before the world but it's based on his foreknowledge of our free choice and what we choose here so I want to say this to you up front before I forget you don't have to wonder if you're predestinated you don't have to sit and wonder am I Born Again am I predestinated just opened a Bible and find out okay because you're you're showing that today if you choose Christ today every day several times a day every time you open the Bible every time you spend time with God you are proving your predestination because it's based on his knowledge before of your choice now so now is the day of salvation now is the day the time to choose that it does not make evil happen but permissive for a purpose like in the fall I'm going to talk about the fall here in a moment uh he didn't make it happen but he knew given the circumstances the opportunity it would and it would take part in this great drama God's great plan brings his word or seed predestined eternally from God at the right time in our lives I have a whole lot to say so if I could get really fast here I apologize but God loves poetry music art and plays these things all show some part of the character of Christ if it's done right I believe God is even in math and science those things at one time I believe are used to prove God not to try to disprove him but brother Banner said God is in music God is in art he's in nature and in the universe he's in all those things he's really everywhere you look if you know what to look for but that includes these dramas and uh so let's just take a look at all of time for a moment from the beginning to Future home that's not per se what the future home will look like that's just a picture I got it looks good but just to give you a visual here so from the beginning all the way to the end you have this great big drama and if you look at it as a high level not a lot of little details but just the broad overview it makes a great big story okay from the beginning to end this huge story that includes all kind of characters all kind of people and overall kind of times and events and and circumstances but it's a big drama and it all took place in the mind of God before the world and we're seeing it lived out today now you get a little bit on the lower level you can get down into the lives of individual characters say just in the Bible for example get down to the nitty-gritty of their lives their individual lives were a drama in this big drama and he'd get down on a lower level the events that happen in their life were little bitty mini dramas inside of the drama of their own life so they're just layers and layers of this that's just it's uh just these plays these dramas stories whatever you want to call it that all manifests some part of the character of Christ so in any drama there's these certain elements and I'm not an expert on drama just Google some of this to see which ones compare one's definitely there there's an antagonist there's got to be that antagonist which is the bad guy the enemy so let's take a look at Genesis for a minute in the beginning let's look at where these start to come into the picture so you have first just like a novel or story or a movie or whatever you have this beautiful scene you have a happy family and then you know you kind of fast forward to the end and they all live happily ever after at the beginning they seem to be happy but somewhere in the middle there's got to be this element of the antagonist the conflict the conflict resolution all those things for to draw you into the story but in this case that's not it's not just to draw you into the story it's more like to manifest the character of Christ because in the beginning was this beautiful scene okay uh of Adam and Eve they walked with the Lord and she wasn't she wasn't even the time she was Adam's wife the woman but they had Fellowship communion they walked together and Gabby and I've often just as husband and wife kind of pondered suppose that maybe the Lord I'm not saying he did but maybe just speculating maybe he would have been walking them along in the garden and saying consider the Lily consider like he did with the disciples sometime later on like he did in the gospels consider the Lily and and talk about the Lily how it manifest part of his character and then the Rock and the river and the mountain and all those type of things because everything portrays something about the character of Christ maybe one day he came up on a rock and he said now Adam you eat my children this represents my uh my Revelation I'm sharing with you a revelation of me I'm sharing you with you my character so you know what I am you're fortified and you're safe behind that rock and it's solid they might have handled it said yeah Lord It's solid it's it's firm but then he might have said something like but it also represents salvation and they might have said what do you mean salvation because they had no way to know so he might have said well you know hold that thought just wait just a little while you'll find out because that's part of the story and in Comes This antagonist the serpent okay well really the devil and the serpent now as he comes into the stage here uh there's this conflict right off the bat right at the very beginning of the story there's this great conflict called the fall and then just hitting high level here not getting in too much detail uh after that is the protagonist uh brings in which is Christ okay the devil and Christ are throughout the entire story in different forms wearing different masks they appear all throughout this great story and uh in different people you know brother Banner said God takes his man but not his Spirit the devil takes his map not his spirit so they're acting throughout this whole entire drama wearing different masks the antagonists took on the form there of the serpent but there's uh but then here comes the protagonist Christ and he says I'll put enmity between the seat of the servancy of the woman and he fulfills that at Calvary so Calvary was the ultimate conflict resolution it solved everything every problem caused by the fall and then and of course the battle and then the guy gets the girl rides off into the future home so just be Christ and the bride and it's a beautiful happy ever after for all those that are affected by Redemption because like by the way he's been talking about Redemption doesn't affect just Christ in the bride it's it's not just the bride it's all these other groups involved in this great big drama beautiful story such a beautiful story and we're all a part of it in Genesis it doesn't ever refer to this creation as being perfect though it's without flaw that we're no flaws because God made it but it keeps referring to over and over again that God saw the light that it was good God saw this and that it was good over and over again it mentions good but again it's like perfect now there's a difference there and the strongest concordance good means Pleasant or agreeable this is what brother Bob got into Wednesday night um perfect though is having reaches in complete in other words completing all its parts full grown full age full maturity and that kind of thing so when God does anything including his creation here it was good but there had to be this conflict in order to bring perfection in time over time over the space of this period that we've entered into called time so it all had a purpose in there every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with him there's no variableness neither side of turning of his own will be God he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creature there is good and perfect differentiated there in that verse James one good is of good Constitution or nature useful salutary good Pleasant agreeable think about it's your new birth you're coming to a position where you're agreeable the spirit of you agrees with the word so you keep on going you're good but you're not perfect you're not complete you still have to keep going on to completion so many people stop it good but let's keep going on to completion perfection perfect means brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to complete this completeness consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult of full age mature okay so the people in the Bible likely did not know that God was making their life a part of his great drama could he be making our lives a part of his drama as well let's consider that elements of a drama or play that you have settings you have character plot protagonist antagonist that's the good guy bad guy you have the dialogue the acts and scenes think of the Bible you have conflict or tension and then there's a climax there's a conflict resolution or I don't have to look up that we're gonna say it I had to wrote down here the day Newman I never I never knew that word day Newman I think it's how it's pronounced so a resolution okay is reached Jeremiah 29 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not have evil to give you an expected in your script personally catered to you was written in the mind of God before the world he had it in his mind it's your part of you know his eternal life he had that for you laid out okay he has a journey for you to go through a drama for you to go through and it's all based on your free choice here so what you're choosing now okay is is what that's based on he has your script in his mind you just attach yourself to it in the New Birth Journey okay this is our own brother Bob Wednesday night he started your Revelation this is his quote okay this is what he said not brother Brown okay I'm just saying this is what he said it was profound he started your Revelation he's going to finish it he's going to bring it to an end he started it and finishes it he started the whole thing he's going to finish it he said the first was Reuben the last was Benjamin the birth birthstone of Reuben was Jasper the birthstone of Benjamin was sardine he was to look upon his Reuben and Benjamin first and last he that was which is and shall come he's Alpha in the Greek alphabet Omega in the Greek alphabet he was the first and last he was from Benjamin Rubin Ruben to Benjamin what is it speaking of that he is the author of your faith and he's your finisher he's the same voice the whole time I remember him talking Wednesday night about a voice same voice you hear through your whole journey and the one that started the work is able to finish it he's the one for moving to Benjamin Jasper's hardest it's a journey a process that God has been dealing with you as he takes you on a journey like he took Abraham on Ruth on an Israel on all these stories dramas stories in the Bible David and Abraham and Moses every one of them you can go back and see that they started from somewhere and God took him to a place of completion I'm talking about that your life this is later in that Wednesday night I'm talking about your life that has to be Vindicated your life has to be proven scripturally that matches up with the Bible that's the kind of person God is going to take in body change that's why you know as we're studying these things out these sermons The brother and a priests the little stories are just kind of woven in here for a purpose to build up our faith to give us revelation of something that maybe was previously hidden from who is this Melchizedek and after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food you left the other thing you have been formed in the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany okay Hebrews 11 contains which is what we're on in Sunday school brother Bob's been on Hebrews 11. contains examples of plays written in the lives of real people in the Bible these were not fiction none of this is fiction it's all real the word of God is so real it's so alive it's a living thing I hate to say thing but it's God in letter form that logos that condescended out of Elohim to be revealed they show different parts about the character of Christ many people in the Bible acted the character and purpose of Christ without knowing it their last were examples to us God's kind of seems from out from Elohim to flesh it went from his thought to word or logos to flesh and his brother why he's been preaching from John 1 1 and begin with his word with God and Word was God word is my flesh built among us we're part of that okay he's coming being made alive in our flesh we're part of that Revelation God's character was brought back brought into flesh and Jesus then in US it produces his life in us and causes his dramas to unfold reflecting his own character word includes stories drama whole written Bibles songs and Psalms all from the Garden of Eden until Revelation is a drama made up of people and their stories from the unveiling of God I'm trying to skip on down and just skip a halfway down Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God pouring yourself to the human being as a Believer pour out it was a part of his drama to do so God had all the fullness of the god and Body in his person Jesus Christ okay second Corinthians 3 you are our Epistles written and read written in our hearts gone read of all men for as much as you're manifest manifested declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us not written with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not entails of storm but in flesh the tales of the heart okay God uses and think about well I'm going to get on names here in a minute if I have time think about the name Zoe that's become a popular name now I know we have it so we um well two's always anyway it's always a popular name it means the life of God I think um there's a lot of a lot about names we're going to get into here just want to mention that while I was thinking God uses drama to reveal his character and attributes the elements of drama are very effective in achieving this especially through the law of opposition and we wouldn't appreciate day if it wasn't for night we wouldn't appreciate Health if it wasn't for being sick every now and then the conflict and subsequent resolution make known as mighty power it's all part of his great love letter to make himself known okay the trial that we face in our spiritual journey as part of the drama all right so the benefits are like confidence that God is with you when you start seeing what I'm fixing to talk about you'll see you'll have confidence in the Lord here's those examples I want to get to these as quick as I can okay so brother Branham he was preaching on this day as a scripture fulfilled and y'all I'm sure y'all probably remember what happened there there was two pages stuck together in his Bible stuck perfectly together think of the drama this is one of those dramas I'm talking about as an example two pages stuck perfectly together and I was reading from the 17th chapter instead of the 16th well I said it's all finest for some cause and just as plain as you could hear any voice The Voice came to me and said he entered into Nazareth what he was brought up at and went to the synagogue and it was his cut as was his custom and the priest gave him the scripture talking about Jesus now to read and read Isaiah 61 and when he read the scripture he sat down handed the priests back the Bible the Bookman sat down all the odds of Congress were upon Him precious word proceeded from his mouth and he said this day is the scripture fulfilled that actually happened again and here on this uh 1965 brother banham there was a a pre uh what he called a priest Catholic priest on platform I think behind him brother balance paid his stuff together and this Catholic priest came up and hand in the Bible and he read it from him from that from his Bible and you know it's just one of those little dramas that's vindicating brother bannon's Ministry and vindicating I think I was still here doing these things living them out in our lives this is the type of thing I want you to look for in your life though this doesn't help you to see these things that I see in my life it's for my comfort and confidence in the Lord know that he's been there with me but a lot of you know I drive a chicken truck which is depicted there on the left and um I realized the years after doing this I go in at night I drive till you know 10 at night 11 o'clock at night all up to about noon the next day so drive all night part of the next day and while I'm driving at night I'm thinking about the Lord meditating on his word that's my prayer closet you know that's where I meet the Lord and while I'm there I was sometime back a while back I was thinking brother bam told that story of the drama of the testimony in the sea and the disciples were out at Sea as they fished at night I don't know if they always did but they did some fish at night and they'll drag this net along as they catch their fish and talk about the Lord and talk about his mighty works and that's what I'm doing a chicken truck I'm dragging a net big old metal net with same type of animals dumb brute animals with no mind totally mindless animals taking them to the market so to speak to sell them make living for my family while I think of the Lord so I'm living the life of a disciple in 2014. I no sorry that was another year 2023 I realized it back several years ago anyway a little quick story about mining I have his first meeting there was a lot of symbology and remember brother Bob talking the wall back about symbols in the Bible God still uses symbols there's lost symbols in our life and things that mean things our names mean things and a lot of times these symbols in our life are meaningful before Gavin and I met we both wanted a marriage that had Christ a christ-centered marriage whereas a holy matrimony where you put Christ in the marriage by reading the Bible and praying as a couple and then when you have kids do it with your kids likewise that's what we wanted and then the day I met her at Monticello camp in Kentucky um that was she was sitting on a rock between two trees which was symbolic of it I didn't realize this till years after we got married this is where meditation comes in when you go back and review these things in your life that are kind of like captured in time it's past it's over with but you still have memory of it you can go back and review your spiritual journey your natural journey and the word of God and meditate on all those things and begin to see God's been there the whole time it wasn't just by chance you married that certain person it wasn't just by chance you got that job it wasn't just by chance you wanna put your tear you know there's so many things that God ordained in the life of a Believer if you're in Christ he's leading you believe me he's leading you all the way so there was a rock representing Christ and two trees representing mine and Gary's lives consecrated to Christ okay I didn't say Whoopi I got to marry that girl no I just said good to meet you God bless you would you come in and fellowship that's all I went to meet her for because we were there's all these clicks you know how clicks form and I was in a clip with sister Joyce and some other people and I saw her sitting myself and I just went to invite her in and that was it just walked away didn't think anything of her but there was those symbologies there the Lord had my wife set on a rock between two trees symbolizing what marriage we would form later and our Rings she picked them they had uh she liked the crosses on but they have again that same thing diamonds in the Middle with crosses rocks lacrosses on either side another thing the story the brother Branham that he told about the Army packing boy he went to meet this certain girl he was I'm not going to go over the whole story it's really long but basically the guy owns the Armory Packing Company his son wanted to get married went out west to a ranch guy there had some daughters he went to me them and he was interested in getting married meeting a wife getting married they were all forward and flirty so went on the back porch and met this other girl that was an orphan and backward and bashful and kind of ragged dress but modest and all that so he went looking for character he went on that porch found the one he wanted to marry when I went to Kentucky that camp I was at the moment on the back side of the camp like the boy trying to get away from a Flirty Girl like the boy some of y'all know her okay she's not that way anymore she's married happy and grown up but she was a flirty little girl at the time this other certain person I was trying to get away from her that's when I met my wife just like the boy in the story I was about the same age as the boy in the story and um when over there and met her didn't think anything of it and but we met on the back side of that camp and here's this girl like the girl in the story orphan she was a life a cousin to a life of servitude just like the girl in the story not real fancy dress but modest everything I was looking for a Godly Christian girl that would be willing to put Christ in marriage and backward and blushy because that's what I was looking for God knows my heart after we met the youth that camp put on a play that was based on that story after it just happened in the middle of the camp in front of everybody this little drama of us meeting just like the boy and the girl in that story those kids put on that play on the camp I didn't understand that story at the time I didn't know the song the promise from the Kaufman family but they played that song and acted that drama out really weird and it was years into our marriage until I realized that that's why I was saying don't forget these things that happened and meditate on when Ava was born she almost died at three days old our trial that whole trial was according to Mark chapter four it was just very synonymous with the disciples at Sea and not many of you have faced this type of thing where you're in a trial of life and Jesus is asleep on the pillow waiting to see what you will do if you'll believe him or not if you'll believe he's in control even when he doesn't seem to be there he didn't seem to be there I said Lord my baby is dying basically what I pray was something like where you at Lord that's all I said where are you at Lord we're leaving to go to the Bible study that night she was fixing to die so where you at and then later on that that same night uh I got my rebuke you know he in the story he rebuked the disciples for their unbelief and then the winds and the waves he rebuked the wins the waves and They seized so I got my rebuke that night when I read first John 4 it said he who fear is not me perfect in love that was my review right off that the doctor said your baby is stable she had been declining and declining and declining up until that time and then she said your baby's stable so there was the calm and it tied in perfectly and at that same time we were overlapping dramas here because there was that Mark IV and then here's Psalm 23 we're walking down the middle of that one because he prepared that table before me I set my Bible on a coffee table after I just read that verse that spiritual food and due season and I realized something was happening that was fear and death okay just like David and Sam the other walked through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil David had natural enemies but he had those things spiritual enemy we face so as I sat down my Bible opened it up that was symbols but then there was also something spiritual to happen a lot a lot more than that story how do you attach yourself to your script God's predestinary plan for your life read the bomb pray every day and meditate spend time with God anything that goes under that broad category of you spending time with the Lord there's a lot of more things to that meditation is powerful it's mostly an untimed resource Food For Thought first of all think about the word of God that's been revealed to you the things you already understand they're simple just think about what you already know and then let's see if God will bring more and then the names of meanings of names and so forth that's significant spiritual journey where you've come from how did you get where you're at now spiritually and naturally another man taught about the names Elvis and Ricky it's the name for this day it goes with this it means something you say a name means nothing then why did he change Abram's name to Abraham and musicians I'll go and come why'd he change Jacob to Israel they're meaning to names this requires perseverance and a permanent change I'm not talking about try for 90 days I'm saying for the rest of your life from now on read the bomb private and listen to the word of God like anything in life it requires commitment single-mindedness tenacity patience like by the way I've been talking about patience we are crock pot Christians not microwave Christians It's Not Easy Bake Oven sort of a life this is a Daily Grind that's all I have God bless you [Applause] [Music] um
