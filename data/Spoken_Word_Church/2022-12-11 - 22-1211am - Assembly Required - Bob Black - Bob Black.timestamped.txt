[0:04] good morning and God bless you
[0:14] we're getting close to the end of
[0:16] Hebrews chapter 10. so let's just go to
[0:18] the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so
[0:21] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:22] this morning Lord God and we're excited
[0:24] to be able to look into your world Lord
[0:26] and we I just asked Lord that you'll
[0:28] just open things up to us Lord and
[0:29] prepare our hearts for for the day's
[0:31] teaching Lord Jesus and granted Lord
[0:33] It's Judas Bieber by the way it is he
[0:34] studies Lord God and prepare us Lord
[0:36] Jesus grant that Lord in your name amen
[0:41] so in verse 18 of Hebrews chapter 10 it
[0:43] says now where remission of these is
[0:45] there is no more offering for sin having
[0:48] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[0:50] into the Holiness by the blood of Jesus
[0:51] by a New and Living Way
[0:54] the way that Christ prepared for us that
[0:57] he made for us where he said I am the
[0:59] way the truth and the life which he hath
[1:01] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:03] is to say his flesh and having a high
[1:05] priest over the house of God let us draw
[1:08] near with a True Heart in full Assurance
[1:10] of faith
[1:12] so so many times Paul expresses to us
[1:14] that we should have
[1:15] oh
[1:19] oh thank you
[1:20] thank you brother
[1:25] that was weird I normally don't forget
[1:27] that
[1:29] but yeah so many times Paul expresses to
[1:31] us to have um the confidence to to draw
[1:33] near to come boldly to to Christ if we
[1:35] have a need
[1:37] um to draw with a with a true heart and
[1:39] full Assurance of Faith having our heart
[1:41] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:43] our bodies washed with pure water let us
[1:46] hold fast to profession of our faith
[1:47] without wavering for his faithful that
[1:49] promised
[1:50] and let us consider one another to
[1:53] provoke unto love and to Good Works now
[1:57] verse 22 says let us draw near where the
[1:59] true heart and full Assurance of Faith
[2:01] having our heart sprinkled from an evil
[2:03] conscience and so many times Paul will
[2:04] kind of repeats that that that that
[2:06] Christ's blood cleanses us and changes
[2:09] us and changed our our heart our
[2:11] conscience to to want to do evil to want
[2:13] to do to want to do the right thing to
[2:16] want to do to have different desires and
[2:19] that's what um as as we're kind of we're
[2:22] moving over into where Paul gets to that
[2:24] famous scripture that we need to
[2:26] assemble together and so you see where
[2:29] when your heart's changed your you where
[2:32] before you didn't want to assemble
[2:33] together now you want to assemble
[2:35] together
[2:35] before you didn't want the things we got
[2:37] now you want the things of God so we had
[2:40] an evil conscience now our heart has
[2:42] been sprinkled spring it's been cleaned
[2:44] up so that now we we you know even
[2:46] though some you stumble and follow the
[2:48] mess-ups to your your conscience is
[2:50] different
[2:52] so let us hold fast the profession of
[2:54] our faith without wavering for his
[2:56] faithful that promised and let us
[2:58] consider one another to provoke unto
[3:01] love and to Good Works Now isn't that an
[3:04] interesting word provoke let's kind of
[3:06] sit on that for a little bit to provoke
[3:08] you know a lot of times when you come to
[3:09] church we we do provoke one another and
[3:12] provoke is provoke is like motivate
[3:14] provoke means now I've got these two
[3:16] little pigeons that are telling us what
[3:17] the what are other words for provoke
[3:20] arouse irritate incite
[3:23] stir that it stir you up when you you
[3:26] know like like the Proverbs says like
[3:28] what we're like iron on iron sharper
[3:29] than one another when somebody says you
[3:32] should be coming to church you should be
[3:34] doing it we should pray more we you know
[3:36] it stirs you up it kind of maybe pokes
[3:38] at your your weak spot or whatever to
[3:41] annoy to stimulate
[3:43] to instigate to excite or Kindle or call
[3:46] forth that's what provoked now so Paul's
[3:49] saying let us consider one another
[3:52] and so many times as I was reading these
[3:54] quotes that we're going to get to in a
[3:56] moment about coming to church
[3:58] so many times brother Brown would kind
[4:00] of explain that you know we're not
[4:02] coming just to our goal is not to just
[4:04] come together as a club or something
[4:06] where we see one another but we have a
[4:08] higher purpose
[4:09] so that's what we're provoking one
[4:10] another to to consider our higher
[4:12] purpose that we're here not just to to
[4:15] we're here to serve a living God and to
[4:17] worship God and to and to grow we've got
[4:19] this our road map here behind us behind
[4:22] me on the board here
[4:24] and we're we're we're we're we're
[4:26] climbing towards something so that's
[4:28] what we provoke one another to provoke
[4:30] one another into love and to Good Works
[4:32] to do things for one another to do to do
[4:35] things that maybe we're lacking so
[4:37] provoke is is like motivation it means
[4:39] to motivators to spark to to pique
[4:42] interests just to stimulate so isn't
[4:46] that what the gospel the preaching of
[4:47] the Gospel does you come to church and
[4:48] you recognize your faults and the things
[4:50] that you're lacking in and you you uh I
[4:53] remember early on in my Christian
[4:54] experience you come to a good meeting
[4:56] and you go away wanting to pray more
[4:58] wanting to wanting to read your Bible
[5:00] more because it provokes you now
[5:02] coursing down to the next the next verse
[5:05] that we're going to get to is is after
[5:06] he's talking about provoking is to come
[5:09] to church
[5:10] now and that is not forsaken now let's
[5:13] consider one another to provoke unto
[5:15] love and to Good Works not forsaking
[5:18] the assembling of ourselves together as
[5:21] the manner of some is so even in that
[5:23] day some people would not assemble
[5:25] together it's a it's a it's a problem
[5:27] that has been constant all through the
[5:30] seven Church ages obviously because it
[5:32] was a problem even in that first church
[5:33] age but exhorting one another and so
[5:37] much the more as you see the day
[5:39] approaching so so now if we look at what
[5:41] exhort means that also is another word
[5:44] to incite by argument or advice to urge
[5:47] strongly
[5:48] so I have somebody you know just just
[5:51] preaching that gospel with all their
[5:52] heart pouring their heart out or you
[5:55] know in the parking lot or when we go
[5:56] out to eat you know you need to do the
[5:59] things that are that the Bible speaks of
[6:01] to give warning or advice to make urgent
[6:04] appeal
[6:08] because you know this Christian Journey
[6:11] if you if you're going to open up a a
[6:13] box set or a puzzle or something that's
[6:15] going to say assembly is required but
[6:17] you're you're a walker your Christian
[6:19] walk assembly is required it's required
[6:21] to come together and well I've got a a
[6:24] an assortment of quotes that we'll kind
[6:26] of read through to to just kind of I
[6:28] want to share with you this morning the
[6:29] things that brother Branham said about
[6:31] coming to church and I think it'll even
[6:33] I was reading through and it just really
[6:35] opens some things up to me to realize
[6:38] how important it is to assemble together
[6:41] and brother Adam said so let's start
[6:42] through and kind of meditate on some of
[6:45] these things he said it's wrong to stay
[6:47] home from church
[6:49] it's wrong to stay home from church
[6:52] now now to keep in context the thing the
[6:55] things that Paul laid out for us that
[6:57] the what Christ did from the cross
[7:00] cleansed or it changed our conscience so
[7:02] now we want something different than
[7:04] what we used to want we're different and
[7:07] and we we're provoking an exhorting one
[7:09] another to good works because to be
[7:11] successful Christians these are the
[7:13] things that are required and the thing
[7:15] that's required of you to be a success
[7:17] is to be is to come to church so first
[7:20] of all it's wrong to stay home from
[7:21] church brother Raymond said and we would
[7:23] see Jesus he said if you loved God you'd
[7:27] be a church you've got to get back to
[7:29] the church back to the Bible back to
[7:31] Christ
[7:32] and Discerning the body of the Lord he's
[7:34] had a real born-again man or a woman
[7:37] that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost
[7:39] will find his place in church worshiping
[7:42] and crying out and doing all this in his
[7:44] life to try to bring Sinners so a real
[7:47] Born Again won't man or a woman is
[7:48] that's got deserved that knows what's
[7:50] right and wrong is going to be in church
[7:54] he said in Christ the mystery God
[7:56] revealed don't stay home if God is in
[7:59] your heart so now there's another we can
[8:01] list lay that out as a fact if God is in
[8:04] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[8:07] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[8:09] here to fellowship with your brothers if
[8:11] you don't don't feel that way don't then
[8:13] then I tell you it's time you've got to
[8:16] pray
[8:18] so we're exhorting and we're provoking
[8:22] now the fella said that brother Brown
[8:24] said in the position of a believer in
[8:25] Christ I can be a Christian and stay
[8:27] home just as well no you can't no
[8:31] so let's let's just kind of lay that out
[8:33] there you cannot be a Christian and stay
[8:35] home just as well if you want to be
[8:38] successful if you want to be a
[8:40] successful Christian you got to come to
[8:42] church you've got to meet together with
[8:44] the rest of the body
[8:46] he has blessed us together in Heavenly
[8:48] places in Christ Jesus and what Visions
[8:51] are he said we feel that every person is
[8:54] Duty bound to attend some church and
[8:56] belong to some church as a Christian
[8:58] many people say oh I stay home and read
[9:01] my Bible I'm just as well off no
[9:05] the Bible said we shouldn't forsake to
[9:07] assemble ourselves together we've got to
[9:10] do that we've got to stand together and
[9:13] all the churches
[9:15] he said and sir we would see Jesus don't
[9:17] sit home and criticize
[9:19] come see for yourself
[9:22] no that's a that's a weighty one
[9:24] especially in these days how easy it is
[9:27] to say well I'm not going to go to
[9:28] church because I don't like
[9:31] pull your list out I don't like
[9:34] something but come see for yourself
[9:36] search the scriptures in them you think
[9:39] you have eternal life and they are they
[9:41] that test them testify me said the Lord
[9:43] Jesus
[9:44] and God doesn't call man to judgment
[9:46] without first warning him he said
[9:47] brother Neville gets to talk to you all
[9:49] the time so then when I'm down here
[9:51] maybe drop down I don't I don't want to
[9:53] be hypocrite enough
[9:54] and not out on a call or nothing just
[9:57] sit up there at the house and Church
[10:00] open down here I don't be hypocrite
[10:03] enough to be sitting up at the house
[10:06] when the church doors are open down
[10:08] there
[10:10] he said in what here is thou Elijah
[10:12] American people want entertainment they
[10:15] don't want the true Gospel of the Lord
[10:17] Jesus Christ so therefore the radio and
[10:20] the television will give them more
[10:22] entertainment than the church can do it
[10:24] and they stay home
[10:27] all that comes out is the elect of God
[10:29] is still hungering and thirsting and
[10:31] calling and crying for the real thing of
[10:33] God
[10:34] now there's another sentence that if you
[10:36] really meditate on that he's talking
[10:38] about
[10:39] he's saying all that comes out is the
[10:41] elect of God that's still hungering and
[10:43] thirsting and calling and crying for the
[10:44] real thing of God so he's associating
[10:47] coming to church with being genuine with
[10:49] something in your heart drawing you to
[10:51] fellowship with God and with God's
[10:52] people
[10:54] watching his star he said and you out in
[10:56] radio land tonight I want you to think
[10:58] of that how can you stay home when
[11:00] there's a Revival in the city where the
[11:02] Lord God is manifesting himself
[11:04] a true Hungry Heart Wants to get close
[11:07] to God and they'll go to every move that
[11:09] they know that comes from God they'll
[11:12] search and seek and Hunger and thirst
[11:14] they long to see God come take the Bible
[11:18] and like the magi's did and read it and
[11:20] see if the scriptures Compares with
[11:22] what's being done then if it is you've
[11:25] got a right to Rejoice with exceeding
[11:28] great joy now you see what a real
[11:30] believer is going to come to church
[11:31] because you your call your your purpose
[11:34] is to worship God your purpose is to you
[11:38] know what you're here for
[11:39] and and and and back then they had a
[11:42] Revival unit where they they would come
[11:44] they would gather together and and see
[11:45] great signs and wonders but now we're
[11:47] entering into a bride Revival where the
[11:49] word is being opened up where the
[11:51] Mysteries are being unfolded and how
[11:53] much more should we want to gather
[11:55] together where the word is being made
[11:57] plain
[11:59] and here ye him he said God wants you to
[12:01] go to church and he wants to manifest
[12:03] something to you through his word
[12:05] through some move that he's making you
[12:07] fail to go you'll miss seeing something
[12:10] so again if you want to be a successful
[12:13] Christian you got to come to church
[12:16] in identification he said if you don't
[12:18] have a church you must see you'll die
[12:22] spiritually you'll just dwindle away
[12:25] I got this picture of this plant that's
[12:27] just if it doesn't have water the water
[12:29] of the word then it's just going to
[12:31] shrivel up and and and not not know what
[12:35] his purpose is and not have the the
[12:38] spirit of the Lord in his life and and
[12:40] you just start shriveling up
[12:43] in Fellowship he said mother used to
[12:45] tell me she said birds of a feather
[12:46] flock together well that's a whole lot
[12:49] of Truth to that you never see the crows
[12:51] and doves feeding together because their
[12:53] appetites are not the same their diets
[12:55] cannot be the same their talk isn't the
[12:57] same
[12:58] and so is the man that's out of
[13:00] fellowship with God has no desire to go
[13:03] to church or do right and those who are
[13:05] with God long for that Fellowship you
[13:09] just can't stand it
[13:11] and forsaking all brother Brandon said
[13:13] you can't go around hanging around and
[13:15] going to pool rooms and hanging away
[13:16] from church and staying home on
[13:18] Wednesday night to see some kind of a
[13:20] filthy television play or something like
[13:21] that and forsake your church and all
[13:24] like that and ever expect to see Christ
[13:26] you have to forsake those things
[13:29] to follow the Holy Spirit
[13:32] and questions and answers she said I was
[13:34] called in on something like this the
[13:35] other day a group in Arizona called my
[13:38] attention to that see a ministerial
[13:40] group said the only thing that we have
[13:41] against you brother Branham is one of
[13:43] the things the people that comes out
[13:46] here with you we can't get them to go to
[13:49] church anywhere I thought this was a
[13:51] really interesting quote because that
[13:52] seems to Bear record even today there's
[13:55] a lot of people around the message don't
[13:57] go to church it's not interesting
[14:00] the people that comes out with here here
[14:02] with you we can't get them to go to
[14:04] church anywhere and he blasted that as
[14:06] hard as he could
[14:07] why is that
[14:10] said they got children and everything
[14:12] they won't go to church and said well we
[14:15] told them they was welcome to come to
[14:16] our church now I know they put a
[14:18] pressure on you and want you to join but
[14:20] you don't have to join Put them kids in
[14:22] Sunday school somewhere and you go to
[14:23] church don't sit at home go fishing and
[14:25] hunting and things like that on Sunday
[14:27] you say well I'm not a legalist
[14:30] the way you'd better be in that manner
[14:31] for a while
[14:33] dishonoring the resurrection of Christ
[14:35] you go to church somewhere
[14:38] now you see you see as we read some of
[14:40] these quotes even brother Brown was so
[14:42] for going to church that he would even
[14:44] make it a point if if they're not
[14:45] preaching all the doctrine fully correct
[14:48] doctor you go to church go to church
[14:49] somewhere anyway anyway go to church
[14:51] somewhere until you find a good church
[14:53] where you can go but you go somewhere
[14:55] because that's a Christian's Duty is to
[14:58] fellowship with others and to show your
[15:00] light not not cover up your light the
[15:03] light that you have with a a like a
[15:05] covered under a bushel or something but
[15:07] you go and be a light somewhere because
[15:09] that's that's your your mandate as a
[15:12] Christian to shed show that light to
[15:14] others
[15:15] any questions and answers
[15:17] he said do you teach that the bride must
[15:19] not attend any other Church unless you
[15:21] are preaching or else otherwise the
[15:22] Tabernacle no I don't teach that I don't
[15:25] believe that I do not believe that
[15:28] we've got ministers sitting here that's
[15:30] scattered all around through the country
[15:31] and I believe they are part of that
[15:34] bride I believe that a man or a woman
[15:36] can go to church anywhere they want to
[15:38] go that teaches the word and I believe
[15:41] if they don't teach the whole word and
[15:43] you can't go to church any other place
[15:45] where they teach the whole word go where
[15:47] they teach half the word until you can
[15:49] get to where they teach the whole word
[15:51] go to church whatever you do do that
[15:57] I think maybe some as we meditate on
[16:00] these we see how easy it is to say too
[16:02] that we believe the message when
[16:05] you know you've got to if you want to
[16:07] know whether you believe the message
[16:08] you've got to get in the message because
[16:11] it'll it'll expose whether you really
[16:13] believe what brother Reynolds says or
[16:15] not you know so many people say they
[16:17] believe what brother Brown says and yet
[16:18] they don't go to church when he clearly
[16:20] said go you got to go to the church
[16:21] that's like my most basic foundational
[16:23] thing is to stay at your post of Duty go
[16:27] to church and every time the door is
[16:28] open you'll be there
[16:30] and trying to do God a service without
[16:31] it being God's will he said people think
[16:33] I don't even believe in people going to
[16:35] church why would they think that
[16:37] because that's that's what people even
[16:38] today believe
[16:40] people people think I don't even believe
[16:42] in people going to church that's a
[16:43] million miles from the truth
[16:45] we must assemble ourselves together and
[16:48] that much more as we see today
[16:50] approaching see we must we must come
[16:52] together in unity if I lived in a city
[16:55] and they had nothing but there but well
[16:56] some church I don't want to call you a
[16:58] name but just any church if they only
[16:59] believed one thing that Jesus was divine
[17:01] all the rest of it was wrong I'd go to
[17:04] that church
[17:05] that's a pretty bold statement isn't it
[17:07] they not believe anything right but that
[17:10] just Jesus was divine and he'd still go
[17:13] to that church if I can't get a whole
[17:15] loaf of bread I'll take a slice I'll go
[17:18] listen and Worship the Lord and show him
[17:20] that I'm doing my part I want him to
[17:23] know I'm alive
[17:26] I want everybody to know what side I'm
[17:30] on
[17:32] I think there's a clincher to the whole
[17:34] lesson this morning as I want everybody
[17:35] to know what side I'm on if you're not
[17:38] coming to church then it's debatable
[17:40] whose side you're on but I want
[17:42] everybody to know I'm on the Lord's Side
[17:44] [Applause]
[17:49] in the church losing the church choosing
[17:52] law for Grace brother Adam said and when
[17:54] men and women get to a place well I
[17:56] really ought to stay at home and see
[17:58] this good play tonight but I'll tell you
[18:00] they'll think I'm Baxley it if I don't
[18:02] go on down to church and you sit there
[18:04] and sleep anyhow you might as well
[18:07] stayed home and looked at something
[18:08] you'd enjoy more but when your joy
[18:11] becomes the Lord
[18:13] and the Lord is your joy you can't stay
[18:16] away from church
[18:18] then you're getting somewhere see he's
[18:21] not he's talking about not just coming
[18:22] to church because somebody gonna crack
[18:24] you upside the head if you don't or
[18:25] because you're trying to follow a rule
[18:27] book but when you love God so much you
[18:30] can't stay away
[18:32] then something real has happened and
[18:36] look what he said he said the church was
[18:38] in better shape 40 years ago for the
[18:40] coming of the Lord Jesus than it is
[18:41] tonight way better
[18:43] they were closer to God they had more
[18:45] God among them they had more Spirit
[18:47] among them than they got tonight
[18:49] it because he's talking about the heart
[18:51] condition where where's your heart at
[18:53] this morning because we get prepared for
[18:55] the for the Day sermons are you so in
[18:58] love with God that you just can't stay
[19:00] away from it
[19:02] because that's the main thing we won't
[19:04] we don't want rule followers we want
[19:07] your heart to be changed
[19:09] in spiritual adoption he said and it's
[19:11] possible get it now listen you can
[19:14] worship through knowledge you can go to
[19:16] church by knowledge that you should do
[19:17] it but going to church that way is
[19:20] worshiping in vain
[19:22] but when there's something happens down
[19:24] in your heart that makes you love God in
[19:28] such a way that you can't stay from the
[19:30] church that's the revelation
[19:33] God revealing
[19:36] that's the revelation
[19:38] when you can't stay away from church
[19:41] and God keeps his word he said and they
[19:43] go to church because they know it's a
[19:44] decent thing to do if that's all you go
[19:47] to church for you're just a hypocrite
[19:50] that's all
[19:52] you don't go to church for thinking it's
[19:54] a decent thing to do you go to church to
[19:57] worship God
[19:58] you go to meet God to thank him and to
[20:02] praise him and to worship him a house of
[20:04] worship now that's what we need
[20:07] I hope maybe that answers the question
[20:09] if anybody's debating in their mind well
[20:10] I don't see the purpose to going to
[20:12] church well there it is you go to church
[20:15] to meet God and to thank him and to
[20:17] worship and enter into his praises and
[20:19] to get fed and get your get your
[20:21] spiritual belly full to get it so that
[20:24] God can minister to you
[20:26] a man that's born of the spirit of God
[20:29] loves to go to church better than he
[20:31] loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry
[20:34] oh you think about that that you a real
[20:37] Christian is going to love coming to
[20:38] church more than they love going to
[20:40] Subway
[20:41] more than they love Zaxby's more than
[20:44] they love a good a good steak dinner
[20:46] calls this more than life to you the
[20:49] spiritual man on the inside has got to
[20:51] be fed if that man isn't fed he'll die
[20:54] the outward man isn't fed he'll die and
[20:58] so will the inward man
[21:00] and they haven't present water from the
[21:02] rock this is a lot crammed in here so if
[21:04] you can't see it I'll just I'll just
[21:06] read it he said Just Like A Love Affair
[21:08] if you was going with a girl because you
[21:10] knew it was a duty are you going with a
[21:11] boy when you were young mama wants me to
[21:13] go with this guy but I just can't stand
[21:15] him
[21:16] you don't get nothing of him coming to
[21:18] see you
[21:19] or if it's the same way about the girl
[21:21] to the boy or boy to the girl you go
[21:22] with her she bores you mama wants you to
[21:25] go with her because she's the type of
[21:26] girl that mama likes see it bores you
[21:30] there's no love affair
[21:33] if it bored you you go to sleep and
[21:35] you'll just get real tired and it
[21:37] because it's you're not in love with it
[21:39] but you don't care you don't want to
[21:41] clean up you don't want to go see her
[21:42] and it's why it's a horrible thing and
[21:44] when he's coming to see you Mike you
[21:46] just wish he'd hurry on go home
[21:49] you just wish he'd just hurry on up so
[21:51] you could go to Subway the thing that
[21:53] you love more than the than the word of
[21:55] God
[21:55] that's the same way it is when you why
[21:58] does he preach so long what about all
[22:01] this stuff and everything see you're not
[22:03] in love
[22:04] but when you really hang on to every
[22:07] word as the spirit gave you warning this
[22:09] morning hanging on to every word
[22:12] that might be what he has been talking
[22:14] to you about holding on it's eternal
[22:17] life every word of God it's a joy to go
[22:20] to church under any circumstance whether
[22:24] it's hot cold and different whether the
[22:27] people are fussing growling whatever
[22:29] they're doing is still a joy to hear the
[22:31] word of the Lord then you're in love
[22:33] then with Christ see you love to go to
[22:37] church
[22:38] program in Fellowship brother Raymond
[22:41] said well I knew they were very formal
[22:42] and different so I said you know Dr
[22:44] Brown the reason of it is they don't
[22:45] have the right thing in their heart if a
[22:47] man is right in his heart and the church
[22:50] bell rings he just can't stand still
[22:53] he's got to go
[22:55] that's all right it's life and death to
[22:57] it
[22:58] he must move
[23:00] and Bob and Gilead he said have you lost
[23:02] all the joy the gospel don't sound to
[23:04] you like it used to there's something
[23:06] wrong then if that love of God isn't
[23:09] above everything else that your heart
[23:12] when that church bell rings your heart
[23:15] just burns
[23:17] this morning aren't you just glad to be
[23:20] in church this morning
[23:22] when the church bell rings or something
[23:24] ringing in your heart
[23:25] that you got to get to church
[23:28] because you love God and the
[23:30] unpardonable sin he said he give me the
[23:31] Holy Spirit the things that I once hated
[23:34] I now love the sacrifice it used to be
[23:38] hard for me to go to church I love to go
[23:41] now to hear the people sing and shout
[23:44] and testify I used to hate it I love it
[23:47] now something has changed me
[23:50] then I have a New and Living Way
[23:52] something has anchored here
[23:54] you know in the church when brother
[23:55] Brown was preaching the church ages he
[23:57] made a statement that that God has made
[23:59] us Kings and Priests and priests in the
[24:01] Old Testament offer sacrifices well here
[24:03] in the New Testament you offer
[24:05] sacrifices and your sacrifices are the
[24:07] sacrifices of your time and of your
[24:10] money and you sacrifice to come to
[24:12] church because you love it and that's
[24:14] what a priest does a priest offers
[24:16] sacrifices you're offering sacrifices
[24:18] when you come to church it used to be
[24:21] hard for you to go to church but now you
[24:23] sacrifice because God has made you a
[24:25] priest
[24:27] and forsaking all he said you who have
[24:30] fallen away stay home on Wednesday
[24:31] nights and won't come over here to
[24:33] church watching televisions and other
[24:35] nights of church think you you really
[24:37] say if you have to come to church you
[24:38] have to force yourself to do it because
[24:40] you think it's a law you do it you ought
[24:42] to do it it's honorable to do it and if
[24:44] you don't love to do it there is
[24:47] something wrong
[24:48] there's a holy spirit that makes you
[24:50] love to serve God
[24:53] and forsaking all
[24:56] I think that's a duplicate quote and be
[24:57] not afraid he said the Revival is over
[25:00] and we here not long ago why the Revival
[25:03] was burning and now it seems like it's
[25:05] kind of hard to get the church filled up
[25:07] the pastors tell me that it's hard
[25:09] nowadays and the people won't go to
[25:12] church
[25:13] they'd rather stay home and watch
[25:15] television or something the Love Has
[25:18] Gone out of their heart
[25:20] and the unwelcome Christ he said you
[25:22] know people have things in common people
[25:24] who love the Lord they like to go to
[25:26] church because they have things in
[25:28] common we have common grounds for things
[25:30] we come here because we're all believers
[25:33] in this way of worship we believe in
[25:35] Divine Healing that's the reason you
[25:37] bring your sick here you don't go to
[25:39] places they don't believe in Divine
[25:41] Healing to get sealed healed you go to
[25:43] places where they believe in Divine
[25:45] Healing and we believe in worshiping the
[25:47] Lord in the spirit and that's why you
[25:50] come here is because we have its
[25:53] Fellowship
[25:54] in Pride he said oh Pharisees plenty of
[25:57] them oh you say I belong to church
[25:59] that's all right sure you do but what
[26:01] attitude do you take towards my Lord
[26:03] when he wants to come to you and bless
[26:06] you you won't do it oh no I don't
[26:08] believe in that kind of stuff that's the
[26:10] same group I'm talking about very
[26:11] religious but very Pharisee what did I
[26:14] say they was in the beginning actors
[26:16] quit acting religion get an
[26:19] old-fashioned experience every
[26:20] generation born again
[26:22] my Lord he longs to see you he's waiting
[26:25] for you takes the little place in the
[26:27] corner he never rebukes you for it he
[26:29] loves you you go to church once or twice
[26:32] a month you think you've done your duty
[26:33] oh if you only loved him you'd go every
[26:37] night and every day
[26:39] somewhere and talk with him if you loved
[26:42] him
[26:45] and why are people so tossed about he
[26:47] said let my neighbors gossip let this
[26:49] and that or the other be gone I go to
[26:51] church for one thing that's to stay in
[26:54] your presence I've moved in there Lord
[26:56] I'll never desire to leave again I'll
[26:59] Trust your word what you say there's
[27:00] where I want to be drop the veils around
[27:03] me Lord that I can only see Jesus Christ
[27:05] and live and walk and die in him there
[27:10] you are
[27:11] and as the musicians come forward he
[27:13] said in the voice of the sign
[27:15] We Believe
[27:17] that every Christian ought to have a
[27:19] home church that they go to
[27:21] every Christian ought to meet somewhere
[27:23] with believers and wherever you meet
[27:26] that's the church
[27:28] and he said and hear ye him when a
[27:30] Christian will stay home from church to
[27:32] see some silly play like that there's
[27:34] something happening in that person's
[27:36] life
[27:37] The Holy Spirits went out somewhere
[27:39] and he said in the uncertain sound we
[27:42] ought to worship all day Sunday that's
[27:45] the day set aside for that so now go to
[27:47] Sunday school in the morning somewhere
[27:49] and stay for church and it's always a
[27:51] sin to send your children to Sunday
[27:53] school you know that everyone knows that
[27:56] a sin to send your children to Sunday
[27:59] school take them
[28:01] how many loves to come to church this
[28:04] morning because you love God
[28:07] God bless you
