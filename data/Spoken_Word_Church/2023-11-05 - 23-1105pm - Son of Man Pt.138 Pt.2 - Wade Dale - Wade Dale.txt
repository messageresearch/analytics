ordinances and we try our best to do them all I know I told you there was one Pastor one time we asked him about taking communion he said we take communion when when we uh the pastor felt the people were ready I said well we probably never would take communion so so you know if we just all felt we all going to feel unworthy today but there's got to come a time to where we're going to take the

praying we've seen hand of God move and we know that he's not quit being in the healing business he still is so and he's a god of impossibilities he don't care about numbers he don't care about situations he never has cared and and and said okay I've got 25 Devil's got 45 I'm in trouble no he said give me one he said just give me one all right and that one your prayer could touch God for anybody amen so let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord thank you for the time you've give us we now have an afternoon service Lord that that we'll sit here and listen Lord just for a little while and then we'll take that beautiful ordinance of communion you said to do it until you come Lord that we take the communion wine and the bread Lord and and we remember you father and what you did for us Lord may we never forget that may it be a a communion of every day that we commune with you Lord I pray that you be with ones that the sick continue to touch the ones Lord that are that are homebound Lord that can get them to church Lord we sure want them to be here and want to see their smiling face father I pray that you just bless this service your hand be upon it and just be with us Lord as we leave and take our week of work Lord may you it not be a a as we say a a dreary Monday Lord but it'll be a a resurrection time that we've learned something from you today Lord and we take it in and apply it to our life father just give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name amen all right part 137 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh that's what we're trying to head to because look when we look at the dispensations of God all right now God brother Brown said God was a dispensationalist and he was a dispensationalist okay so we are dispensationalist CU you and I live in the dispensation of the son of man right and the dispensation of adoption but it wasn't required I'll read it to you in just a little little while this is not required what this was required this is not required what this one's required but you and I are required to make that Word Flesh in the end time not working under the Son of God anointing but under the son of man anointing which is Jesus back in flesh here on the earth like brother Bram said not praying for the sick talking to theck sick all right that scares people I don't know why you don't just it it ought to it it ought to make you to where you know it's not the power and it's power with character CU brother Brown talks about power with character he does talk about power without character is satanic but Power with character is what fit to rule so you what start ruling yourself first then rule your family and rule the surroundings and rule the situation that you're in all right so that's why that we're heading toward son of man The Headstone because listen there wasn't a time in Jesus's life on this Earth that he was not in control right oh no on the cross no that he was the most controlled on the cross than he had ever been his whole life he controlled his own death that's right he hung for three hours he should have died for what they did to him but he gave us the ghost so nobody killed him he gave his life as the Bible says say he gave his soul a ransom so he could see what see his seed and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the Lord as blessings to the reading of the word John 16:12 says I have many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now in other words there's a time in a place there's a time in a place in Preachers lives there's a time in place in your life there's a time in place in church there's a time in place in government there's a time in place all different things like we're talking about dispensations so there was a time that Jesus was standing on Earth and nobody understood who he was no one even the 12 that were around him and one of them was fixing to betray him here in just a little bit when we take communion all right none of the 11 understood he knew that but he knew that he was going to give them a promise that he was going to come back in another form another dispensation he was was the son of man he was God in human flesh standing on Earth and nobody understood who he was so don't you think for one minute that when the son of man stands back on the Earth again and a bride they going to understand them no listen there's going to come a time when that end time bride that takes a body change is not even going to be understood by the Bride of he proved all out through like like Jesus he's standing there nobody he says I have many things to say but you cannot bear them now brother R stood one day and he said it's gone from you I have many things to say unto you for six days I preach the seals to you and you cannot bear them now right it's exactly what he was saying you're not getting it so in other words if you're not not getting it John if Jesus says you're not getting it there's going to be a group that did I just believe that how be it when he the spirit of Truth Now what is that now that's another dispensation that's the dispensation of the Son of God where Jesus Christ comes now in the form of the Holy Ghost in your soul burst you into the body makes you a son and then we got to go to adoption because he will guide you into all truth you know I was reading the other day we was talking about um me and somebody else was talking about something we was talking about um you know you say well I don't I don't I'm I'm not going to go to church there because I don't like the song leader I don't like the song music or I don't like brother R said the only reason you leave a church is is if the pastor's off the word and if you can find somewhere else different that preaches I ain't talking about me I'm talking about the dispensation that we've been given that brother Dale's preached brother Mo preach brother Dale preached and for two years I've tried to keep everything together and and preaching the same thing that that well no it's okay but that then we've seen all truth when the seals are open that's all truth you go so set somewhere else and and and like I said before many times and I'm bragging on God because God is the one that gives us this not the devil I'm sure the devil's going to confuse us he's sure is going to poke a little confusion in here somewhere all right but you go take 20 people out of the out of the um see you can that you take 20 people go down here to Gainesville bring 20 people send them down to church half of them will be gone before the service is over but they won't understand a word that we're saying now then you take another group you go take 20 denominational good Baptist good Methodist or whatever you want to say Pentecostal bring that group of 20 in here and set them down they're under the Christian dome right they're on the Under the Dome of Christianity and some of them believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved but as far as understanding headstone headship son of man Ministry the seals the bows the plagues the Daniel 70 weeks all the different things the because they're going to bring their denominational Doctrine in that hell is eternal there's three Gods we were talking between Services you know they they to explain a trinity is hard to just say God is one that's the most simple thing you can ever say in your life God's one there's one God there's nothing before him there's n after him there's only one he doesn't look over here and get counsel from this one cuz a trinitarian counsil would be three people sitting there and they're getting counsel from each other God don't have to get counsel from no one cuz he's the only one he swears by no other right cuz he swore by himself so that's easy to understand the trinitarian doctrine is a little you know get a little off to one side or the other but he will guide you into Al truth amen if you want it you got to make yourself as what what did Brother ra say you got to be disciplined listen to the word of God Listen to What God Says forget about listen forget about your emotions how many times brother Dell tell us see we like to quote brother Dale when it when it affects us it's really nice and sweet but let me tell you what he said many many thousands of times he what do he where do he tell us to put our feelings where sit on them put them in the seat of your pants and sit down on them y maybe we ought to do that sometime how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself and that's what we've been talking about he's not speaking of himself anymore he knows who he is but he wants the world to know who he is through a bride that's his plan I didn't make it he made it and it must be perfect and he will show you things to come in other words give you further Revelation day by day don't you ever thank God though when you when you when you're sitting listening to a service or or just uh even listening to somebody online or something or some brother El's past services and you go that's what that is well that's a revelation thank God for that that's something that the piece of the puzzle is being more clear and it's fitting together more in your life we always talk about bringing our little Els of fire together why don't we bring it in here and let it burn this place down right cuz listen that fire is a consuming fire it will not burn this building down I'll promise you that but it sure will burn the devil out I promise you that he hates that kind of fire never has liked that kind of fire devil went nowhere around when the Bush was burning in Moses's day he might have been later on but he wasn't standing right there cuz he said you take your shoes off cuz this ground is Holy today you've seen the fire of God and no matter how much that we try try to think we're right in saying a Creed or joining a church you're still what you were into you're actually born again the new birth is an experience something that takes place reason I keep saying that is that's where you got to begin from if you're not there you will not go any further up the statue of perfect man you will not get any of these virtues working in your life you will absolutely become confused and listen God didn't say he' lead you and guide you into all confusion no he said he lead you and guide you into all Truth All right so now watch on the first seal remember he's talking about a church and he's preaching and he go he stops for a minute he said I'm going to call you bride all right so we're going to separate that now look that was a young bride everybody with me cuz we're going to read in Revelations 19 where a wife comes into being and I'll show you in just a minute what the Bible says about that word wife all right I'm going to call you bride so there was a young group of people there was a a Young Bride setting there that was not mature they were babbling Pentecostal babies they weren't understanding what he said listen half of the people that you hear on those tapes ask brother George Smith half of those people that you hear on those tapes of different men and brothers that he was close to went out in denomination soon as he died went right back into the same place they were Banks Woods different ones like that they went right back into into the denominations cuz they were there for the EXC they were there for the bait they didn't get the hook right remember brother Brown said they was just bait on the hook all right so never since Jesus was on Earth that's why Satan's fighting so much he knows there's an opponent here that he can't figure out and I want him to be where he's the most frustrated person on the face of the Earth amen so he won't know what to do with us and we are a formidable opponent I say we're formidable oppon opponent if you'll just yield yourself to God in your in your individuality you will not that's why I said before if you start having problems the first thing Satan's going to tell you to do is what don't go to church don't listen to them people don't answer the phone when they call you hello somebody now does God would he be the one to tell you that then you know it's the devil talking to you all right Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead now look we go back now to and I didn't bring it but Revelations 3:14 that is the lay out of seean church age but what did he tell us he says this is the beginning of the creation of God in other words the way God wanted to be created you say God yeah brother Ram said God right before he was God yes before the Eternal there only one man could tell us that and that's the man that went back into the mind of God but he's the head of the body of the church the beginning the first born you know why he's called the firstborn go Adam wasn't born number one right and there was nobody Birthright since him everybody with me don't fall asleep that's why he's the firstborn but now listen him being the firstborn means that there others to be born all right if he's the beginning of the creation of God how in the world can Jesus be the beginning of the creation of God he was what God wanted to do to himself in the Garden of Eden had there not been a fall he would have produced the body that's right brother Brown said eve would have produced the body of Jesus and he would have just stepped right into it that's the beginning of the creation of God that's the birth that you and I are looking for that now he's birthing him self inside of me and you and he becomes the head of that body that's right amen the beginning the first born from what from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now we'll get to a little bit later on not today where brother Brown tells us that we are now collectively the fullness of the godhead bodily the son of man Ministry the son of man in a multiple form will make up the fullness of the godhead bodily cuz there's never been that way before right that by with me Matthew 21 verse 42 this is what we were talking about this morning now Jesus is talking to him he stand say look did you ever read the scriptures he ought to know these people were Christians they were supposed to be the stone which the builders is rejected the same as become the head of the corner right this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you we're talking about that this morning Israel and give to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof I was thinking somebody was preaching the other day about how that Adam I mean Abraham and and uh not Sarah the other one Hagar got together and produced ishmail well that's what's fighting over there right now the ishmaelites have a kingdom God said they'd be prosperous God didn't just kick them out listen I don't care whether they kick her out in the desert with the kid God said I'm going to help you and I'm going to make you prosperous but you're going to be a wild child you're going to be against your brother all the time and that's what's happening over there now they're against each other because of the promised son the son that was made from the from the um free woman and then the one made from the Bond woman all right they're fighting each other because look they got got the same daddy you could never get them together that's why it's going to be turmoil until we come back in the Millennium and then the 12 tribes of Israel be raised up and we'll get to rule and Reign for a thousand years with them all right and you know what I believe they'll be able to teach us some stuff I believe we'll be able to teach them some things all right so it's going to be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof so that's the Gentiles that's me and you and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken we'll get to this a little bit later but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so either you're going to fall on the stone or the Stone's going to fall on you all right you decide which one and we'll look at it maybe if we have time a little bit later the rising of the sun brother BR keep I keep telling you this because look there's a broad spectrum of brides and churches right I told you about one Israel was was Jehovah's bride brother Bram said the Baptist was the bride at one time but he had every time they went whoring or went after another Doctrine he put them away married another one put him away cuz he can do that he's a man if you commit adultery against your husband he can put you away and you can remarry but only in the Lord so brother so Jesus didn't marry prostitutes he wanted a bride so he's looking for that one to come that he can make that his wife everybody with me that's a sole purpose Brides brides churches Brides churches Brides brides Lord of Mercy but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride not that those others were false but they didn't continue on in the furth of the word they didn't take his word as the seed to what to bring forth children unto God they went as Eve did and got filled up with other seed denominational Doctrine all right but there must come one that's not only got mechanics but the Dynamics it makes the church live moving the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs Revelations 19:5 read this the other day and y'all have to excuse me I got new teeth and they get a little dry but I like them for 10 grand I ought to like them and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God they're not going to fall out though they're in there praise our god brother collie was outside a few minutes ago and he was talking to me and his top teeth was falling out I said I got some poly grip if you need some he said I'm good what you as we get older we lose things okay teeth hair sents praise our go yeah s praise our God all ye his Saints and you that fear Him both small and great now watch this is Revelations 19 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude I remember what is Revelations 19 it's when the bride is getting ready to ride back into the Millennium now she's been Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost come to adoption spoke a body change and a resurrection am went up for a marriage supper of three and A2 years yeah all right we're coming back in the Millennium as the wife not as the bride now watch it's going to be really neat to see what this word wife means when you look in a strong concordance and I heard it word the voice of great multitude as the voice of many Waters or many people and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raay and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is righteousness of saints so now I was looking online and this guy had a real good point I didn't have time to you know it's one of them things about this long but he's talking about a bride a bride can be before the wedding CU this your bride to be right and then when you have the marriage ceremony you're bringing your bride and he says you're only Bride for one day after that you're the wife cuz it's not the bride means the two are coming together the two are coming together the bride and the bridegroom are coming together all right well that's in your new birth that's coming together in the New Birth there's Brides brides churches Brides is going to come one what one bride that's going to continue on to this right here look at what the word wife means this word right here means in the Greek come to pass oh wow be done be complete arise be fulfilled listen brother Brown talks about an unfulfilled age the reason there's an unfulfilled age is because the word has not been brought back into Power this is not an unfulfilled age I declare to you today some body is going to fulfill everything that Jesus Christ had in his mind before the foundation of the world you can just figure out it's you or somebody else all right be fulfilled be married to look be preferred there's been Brides brides churches bride is going to come one and she's going to be preferred above all the rest now listen God's not going to forget Israel he's not going to forget the Baptist and the Methodist there going to be a lot of them in heaven oh but to have a bride that'll come that'll become a wife and make everything be fulfilled how satisfying is it you that are married and have been married how satisfied is it that when you come to a place to where it's like Mom and Dad always said you know as you get older you get you even get to look alike but you start thinking about something and and one turns to the other and say let's go Walmart and the other one's like I was thinking the same thing well you know that's that's humanly bringing the thing together what about God what about the communion with God if he's your husband right he's my husband I'm trying to become a wife to be a wife I've got to what fulfill all of his desire which is not down here we know it's all the other things but it's not sexual it's not anything like that it's doing what he said it's doing the word of God the way to please God is to do what he said yes amen listen we don't have to go learn 12 years in in another 12 years in college and learn how to do this and learn how to do that we just got to learn how to do what he said already so this word wife means come to pass whatever he has given to the bride is going to be fulfilled or come to pass in that wife he was happy with the first church age that's his bride but she wasn't ever a wife second Church age bride but never a wife all the way down to this age bride but never a wife now his wife is now making herself ready now it didn't say he was making us ready so there's something you and I got to do read the book of Esther there's a little man kind of strange that Mori meant little little man and brother rown was about what 5'2 53 be man okay but remember Mori told Esther that hey you go do this but Esther had to go in and put the clothes on but he was telling her he was he was giving her Secrets telling her how to you know what to do but she has to be the one to go put them on she had to be the one that her life was at stake because the the the king all he had to do was say kill her I didn't call for her he'd not seen her for 30 days and then all of a sudden she knew listen wife she knew what to put on to make sure that King wasn't going to kill her she knew what kind of dress she knew how to walk she knew how to do her hair come on somebody she knew how to do that before she went in the court because to go in the court any other way was death read the book of Esther we've done it many many times and did some some studies on it but you just read it yourself is totally the characters of right now were the characters of back then and and you know what God was not mentioned one time in the Book of Esther it was all about the bride amen it was all about the bride and the little man that gave her the secret to continue on in her life amen and then of Israel was saved because of her well guess what when you and I get out of here Israel will be saved because we're gone and they're going to receive the same message that we receive they're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost and they're going to take a Rapture after they're killed all right everybody with me Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick powerful sharper than the two-edged sword is what we talking about this morning piercing even to the dividing a sun of Soul and Spirit and Joint Mar and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's why you see a preacher up here every once in a while they'll get to preach in a way and and they'll turn and say something that you'll think man that wasn't and you'll even say that wasn't even in my notes well that was a discerner that was God Discerning not me looking over there on top of your head and this television open up like in brother R's day it would open up and it would tell them their life the word is what doesn't it right the word's what opened up the the the life to the to the prophet amen all right so the word is what's going to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart right as I've always said before and I hate this and I hate to say we've got more people taking communion now than ever oh communion Wine's almost done it was a success amen you'll see but anyway so just want to throw that in there I'm kind of cuz I really was scared literally got on my knees and brother Joe Canada were doing a a video of it so that we can put the ingredients and all you know you get it your ingredients on a piece of paper we got it from Jeffersonville actually from the Tabernacle how to make it but every time that there's a step brother Joe has come and we've done a video so it's going to be out online to where people can make their own communion wine and not have to buy that junk that's got yeast and everything else in it out in the world and we thank God that brother Dell decided to do that 50 some odd years ago and we've never had to buy communion wine here we've always had it made by holy hands that's why Sister Lisa makes the bread made by holy hands we don't have to buy it from the outside don't hold it over brother Ryan takes at home and burns it so um we trying to do everything we can to make sure even the little things are done right okay so we sure do appreciate you but but but when you start standing up and you get ready to serve communion there's kind of a it's kind of like Israel out of Egypt there's an exit there's some people just can't take it they just can't take communion so they exit out the door I hope don't do that even if you don't take communion stand here and say God I want to do this ordinance but like I said before don't sit there and beat yourself up that you know you might have snapped at your wife you might have you know you might have slapped a neighbor's dog or you might you know I'm not saying that by experience but um say God forgive me and take Comm that's right in your soul see in your soul is where you're taking that from see I'm off on a little on a little side note but in your soul is where you're taking it if you if you took your memory reason conscious effects and Imagination we'd all never take it what the devil piles in on us all the time but you got to deny all that do the best you can and God said do this till I come and like I said many times before in foot washing everybody likes to take communion then leave footwash and Jesus said if you don't do this you'll have no part with me now how much stronger can you be than that if you don't do he said Peter if I don't wash your feet you'll have no part with me so every ordinance is the ordinance that we need to to uh partake of and I know some have uh feet that have feet issues and stuff and we understand that but I mean every time after every time after every time listen your feet don't hurt first Sunday of every month you'll go to work the next day and you're like like I said about people can't come to church they can go take a vacation and be gone for a week and they get in the car and they ride and they have all kind of Hallelujah time but I can't sit an hour in church I just can't do that well get born again you will that's just bottom line like the brother said if you if you're born again you'll come to church if you don't you won't and if you're a m believer you'll do it every once in a while right so your soul is the is the real you that's the person that's going to have to give an account that's what God's going to judge he's not going to judge your flesh he's going to judge your soul he said don't worry about the guy that can kill your flesh you worry about the guy that can kill the soul all right cuz so now look if you receive the soul of almighty God at the new birth God can't kill God so you're safe am amen but the ones that have to go to the white Throne judgment and have to give account for their deeds and their Works scare you to death scares me thinking about it right then the spirit realm that's the one we're going to have the problem with that's the one that God has give us a new birth at Faith then we have to add all these things to us and that comes from or emanates from the soul but it pushes out it's whatever you can white dog black dog whichever one wins is the one that you push and you feed unclean Spirit goes out Book of Luke unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks dry places comes back sees a house swept and garnished and if you ain't got the door shut he going to walk right back in the house well that's the same way with when you get born again same thing he turns right around and he he's you got doors IND doors brother R said you let God in your house but you won't let him in this room or you won't let him in that room we better let him in all of them I thought we lived under an open door policy amen so if we got the open doors in the word of God we ought to have an open door to let God in all right so Ephesians 1 ver4 says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame now this is what he's saying about me and you sure that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children so there's a group of people that he has predetermined by for knowledge that they would want it so much he puts you right here he put you right here in this age to make you available cuz he' have put you in any other age you wouldn't have been available for it this age right here good or bad according to the good pleasure of his well and adoption remember adoption is not your birth so we got to separate that you can be born again and not come to adoption but you can't come to adoption without being born again you got to be in the family of God before you're considered for adoption all right and it's not adoption like the world does adoptions everybody with me cuz I'll get to it in just a minute and I'll tell you what adoption means as far as pertaining to the Old Testament and to the Jews they still do it today so adoption is second Peter we talked about it this morning so we'll not read it again but look he that lack these things is blind and can't see a far off you have basically cut yourself off from God even though you're born again but he that lackthe things is blind he can't see it for a forgotten he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure all right look you're placing God where should I be amen God what do you want me to be that's right for so an entrance shall be ministered to you so we we've got to have there's got to be a Ministry that helps us get there there had to be a Peter that stood and said add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance there had to be a man there had to be somebody to give this out to you so you can so you can see it amen wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present present truth Matthew 17:5 we read it this morning Jesus is coming up to almost about 6 months before they put him on the cross and God takes him up a mountain and says you hear this guy now that doesn't mean we can't don't hear the rest of it but Matthew 24 was that's Matthew 17 brother Ram showed us in Matthew 24 Jesus preached the seals so he had to be adopted before he could preach the seals in Matthew 24 amen everybody with me right okay we know this brother Dale taught us this for years he preached the seals in 1982 to the best of my knowledge as good as I've ever heard that was in 1982 that's brother Bo that's one you were talking about the 60 something tapes but you ought to listen to him so brother brother R said look after that son was adopted we're going to get to it his name on the checkbook was just as good as his daddy's that's where God's trying to get his church so he's trying to get us to that all right now if God's trying to get us to get there there's got to be somebody that wants to get there cuz he's not going to say it and nobody get there all right the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting to a spot to where that the sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll command it right don't be scared of that amen don't be scared of that that remember what somebody said one time said well you speak the word what if it doesn't happen what if it does what if it does if it doesn't it was you if it does it was him that's all you got to say if you say to this mountain not if I say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart that's why I said before that's why brother Ram had to be taken out of the way because it's got to be the voice in The Bride the bride's got to be the one that comes to adoption and be able to do this mountain be moved mov D and not have to say well let's just let's let's see what brother bram's got to say about it we do see what he's got to say about it 1100 sermons but he didn't say he didn't say if I say right there look not if I say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart what we need is adoption Sons and Daughters needs adoption but how can the church the Pentecostal Church Methodist Church be adopted until they come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first we read that this morning so what do we need for adoption discipline because listen when I start reading this about Bar Mitzvah and about all the things of adoption it is discipline all right Romans 8 8:21 says because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit we talking about this morning even we ourselves grown within ourselves what waiting for the adoption listen Paul's waiting for somebody to fulfill that scripture to wit or to witness or to be part of the Redemption of the body all right do you know that word to wit has been used five times in the Bible and there's no there's no um Greek or there's nothing in the lexican there's no underline in that they don't know how to interpret it but if you'll continue on and look at it you can see that that to W to witness because we know that see see the the church agents would go to wit what does that mean the Redemption of the body waiting for adoption but you and I when we're saying waiting for adoption that's us to Wi or to witness or to be standing here listen if you don't pass away you're going to either be part of it are you going to see it one of the two amen everybody with me I I'd rather be part of it to witness the Redemption of this horrible thing that we call flesh Galatians 3:23 says but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up into the faith which should afterwards be revealed now remember listen this wherefore the law was our school master all right teacher tutor to bring us to Christ right that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we're no longer under that school master all right for ye are now for all ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you has been baptized into the into Christ have put on Christ there's neither Jew or Greek Bond or free male or female for you are all one now look pretty plain Paul you're all one in Christ all right no big guys no little use listen we're feminist in the body Us big great men with hair on our chest some but brother Brown said Faith had hair on his chest all right I'm quoting brother brown but we're all feminist in the body of Christ so we have a headship that's why there's got to be a headship and everything thing you do in Christianity there's a head then there's a body there's no neck that turns it there's no head above a headen there's no two heads one head one body all right and if you be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and airs according to the promise and he continues speaking now man put Galatians 4 one in there but that's just a a letter that Paul wrote now I say he's continuing this thought that the heir now what is an heir all right Paul told us in Romans that we're Heir and join Heirs of Christ I'm an heir because if if something hen let's just say jun's mom died five years ago she's an air because she came from her all right she came forth from her and she is what she is privileged to have what she left that by with me but now brother Donnie was not called when they read the will neither was I but brother Donnie was not called because brother Donnie's not a not a Lineberry or not a Thomas he's not an air he could be given some things but he's not an heir an heir is a blood kin well Hallelujah when you get born again you're a blood K amen you're blood can to the almighty now I say that the heir as long as he's a child now look as long as he's a child differ nothing from from a servant though he be Lord of all cuz he's in the family he's got full Authority but no no no the daddy's not going to give him full Authority as a child but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father now tutor is what one who's care or honors anything honor anything has been instructed a curator a guardian a Ste a manager of a household of land overseer one who has the care and tutelage of children either where the father is dead a guardian to minors or where the father still alive so it really doesn't matter if father's dead or Father's alive because in the Old Testament as we'll see in this bar mitzvah you're giving over to somebody and that person you know the father's his business is all this the whole kingdom is his business well the son don't get a part of he's he's air to all that Kingdom but he don't get it at first as the father's away I hope you get this as the father's away doing his business he sends a tutor the Holy Ghost he sends a tutor he sends a five-fold Ministry with the Holy Ghost I hope to teach that person his son then the Holy Ghost turns and say makes a report hey he needs a little work right here can I do this he needs a little work right here can I can I thump him on the head a little bit you start talking about that they'll put you in jail now man I tell you I I don't understand I know brother Mark and I are about the same age so I remember Miss Haron she was a rather big lady but she was not very tall but she went out to the EG bar and took a 2x6 everybody know what a 2X six is it's 2 Ines thick six inches wide this is no lie and they formed her a paddle out of it looked like a baseball bat it was a handle where she could hold on to it are y'all listening to me kids yeah yeah I'm won't preach made her a handle and not only made her a handle drilled holes in it so that your honey and that board didn't have there in between when she hit you it went and you went ah cuz she hit me one time I ain't going to tell you what she caught me doing but she rared back like a baseball player now do you believe look you take that scenario that happened all time when we were all growing up at this age put it today parental delinquency then not kids the parents oh no my listen when I was growing up that thing that innocent are proven guilty didn't work in our household did he no we were guilty until proven innocent and if you didn't tell the judge and the Executioner you can figure out whichever one that is you got a double shot cuz if they found out about it in your little community that that what wait went to the office and Mr White now Mr White here's another thing he had a I don't know if well they hardly don't do this anymore but they used to shave people and they had a straight razor and they used a a leather Brother Gary know they used a leather about this wide now look it wasn't like is this wi I'm preaching here for a minute and that thing's this thick and they had it on the side of the where you got up and they jacked you up it wasn't n this mashing the button they jacked you up like this you know pneumatic brought you up a little bit and he sit there and he well Mr White had one of them for a paddle and he didn't just need he didn't just one one lay one layer didn't work brother John he doubled it when he hit you he hits you twice so anyway I digress I remember every one of them should have got more but I'm a better man because of it but some of y'all don't even know what I'm talking about and you some of you parents are going I'd take them to court well that's why you have problems with your kids the prophet of God see that's why I say we pick our own little quotes that we want to use brother R said it was not juvenile delinquency even in the 60s he called it parental delinquency we allowed the kids to have that little and you dared the teacher to whip them well it's your fault then cuz mine sure didn't cuz I got one at home when I got one at school I got one at home all right double shot it wasn't love either well it was but at the time it didn't feel like it right and some of you don't even know nothing about it Where'd I go for this one Governor tutors and govern ERS the manager of a household or a household Affairs a steward in other words a manager somebody and that wasn't a manager in this case it wasn't a manager of of of money or anything it was a manager of that kid right that person he managed that kid and if that kid got off here there he was able to give it a little bit of stimulation to get it back in line but he would go tell the father he said look I had to spank him but he didn't Rebel and the father was like oh great but now what if you was one of those that you spanked and kept spanking and kept spanking and kept spanking and kept spanking and for the same thing he'd have to go back and tell the father said look I've done all I can do I don't know what to do about this okay then the father would take over I would assume so God gave us tutors and governors if we'll listen to them and we do need a spanking every once in a while we need a little bit of remembrance brother Brown called it protoplasmic stimulation I've always said there's a nerve in your rear that's connected to your head and if you hit that rear end hard enough it'll it'll help your head even so we when we were children let's get back to the sermon even so we when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world newborn babies in Christ you're under the elements of if you'll remember and be honest with yourself when you be even when you come to the church and you come under justification and sanctification you are a legalist I don't do that no more why they still doing it Go sound like Aaron never mind so here we go so when we were children we were inod he'll see this under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come now look when is the fullness of time now there's no more time after this that's right Bible say times will be no longer not here but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law listen Everything Jesus did was under the law I mean he would heal somebody and said hey go do the law of Moses hey go tell your priest check out that leprosy and make sure he couldn't come he was the law but it was a law made manifest in human flesh that could live iten how many times you well I can't live those Ten Commandments yeah you can amen if you get the one that wrote him inside of you you can but when the fullness of time was come God for sent forth his son made of a woman under the law what to redeem them that were under that law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying father father or ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant all right now you've moved from from what we were talking about here that servant and the a was doing the same thing played the same playground went to the same school doesn't matter if one had the whole the whole backing of Heaven let's just say was in this kid's possession if he' behave himself if he didn't he was still a son he still got part of the of the Airship but he was taught under tutors and governors and then what did he do he graduated he come on up wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son son if a son then an heir of God through Christ so let's look at this just for a second this word is Bar Mitzvah now if you look back in the Hebrew you'll see that the Bible's written where that or maybe the Greek in the New Testament that this was the son of Jonas our Simon bar Jonah bar means son of Simon the son of Jonah all right so bar means son of and Mitzvah also spelled Bar Mitzvah without the H or mitzah it means son of the Commandment so now you're the son of the Commandment what is the Commandment what is our commandment be adopted amen what's our what's our what's our commandment come to the fullness what's our commandment know what to do with the word at any time brother Bown says that's our commandment that's our mandate that's why God sent a prophet not to tell us to dress right and do right and eat right and not do this that that was already in the Bible right right plural Bar mitzvas Bar Mitzvah bar mitzah Jewish religious ritual and family celebration commemorating the religious adulthood of a boy on his 13th birthday that's why you'll see that Jesus was in the temple at about that same age and they were allowing him to read they didn't know he was God he was just this boy that wandered in the in the into the sanctuary cuz you know what at 13 Jesus went to church at 30 Jesus went to church right right so they found him in church coming to this place to where he could read the Torah cuz listen it's not like me and you just reading the book and throwing it on a shelf that Torah to them is is almost God because it's what God said they they count it totally reverent they they they preserve it they they don't even can't even spell the word god remember it's g/ D they can't they don't even want to say that word it's so reverent so it's not something that you just let any 13y old boy that comes in there you know I don't really care but I'll read this no he was a proper child they knew that they knew that when he walked in there that somebody had taught him well cuz remember when he got in there he said I must be about what my father's business not the carpenter man the boy look now deemed personally responsible for fulfilling all the Commandments H at 13 May henceforth Dawn fatores now most of you don't know what that is but it's it's if you see the Jewish people they have ropes of different color they have a thing around their arm of different color and it it it tells kind of what they are and and what level they're at all right pharies which is religious symbols worn on the forehead and the left arm during the week day morning prayer and may be counted as an adult whenever 10 male adults are needed to form a quarum for public prayer so he's very important that's a bar mitzvah that's the adoption that's what you and I are looking at because the father is the one that brings the son out and I'm going read the rest of it because it's a big old long thing they have this ceremony put him out you know and parade him down the street and give him all kind of beautiful robe to put on and all this stuff that's what God's want to do with me and you he's not going to put a listen let me be real he's not going to put a baby with with diapers on a parade that can't even eat for itself no he's going to put somebody that he can depend on that he's proud of that he wants to be there that has come to maturity he's going to parade them around this world he is already doing that now there's Believers in every age every every um Nation we're just not collected together yet we get collected together we're going home I don't mean collected together they all got to come right here you understand what I mean all come to the same level same Revelation the believer's position in Christ now in the spiritual sense after we were born now look after we were born into Christ we become children of God but then see God knows best right now this boy after he got a certain age he had to be adopted into that same family he was born into any Minister knows that that's the placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into so you got to be born again in the line for adoption we've said that many times before could you imagine that but that's the Old Testament teaching Paul's referring to it here in Ephesians the Church of Ephesus now when the father become aware that this boy was not worthy now here's the other side cuz they're not going to let a renegade go into the temple and read out of them Scrolls they those scrolls are sacred all right he never disowned him he was still his son but he couldn't put confidence in him and let me just be plain he's not going to use you for much like I said who's he going to put on display his wife yes but he couldn't put confidence in him he was too carried about with all all kinds of Winds of What doctrine that's what the scripture says be not carried about with every wind of Doctrine be stable stabled always abounding in the works of the Lord for so much as you know your works is not in vain quickly wish we could stay on that a little while but notice the day come when this boy maybe he had been all right he was a worthy man he listened to the father he took instructions he was a good boy then the father taken him out into the public Street and then he put a special clothes on him and then the father had a ceremony and adopted this his son into his family and then this son after he came out there was given no longer was he just like the servant under the tutor he's going back to scripture there in in Galatians he was the boss amen I hope this sink soaks real deep he was the boss yes let's get way down deep where a lot of people don't go this son was no more under a tutor but he was like his father and his father gave him certain things to do the father might have told him you take care of this field over here or you going to do this over here you take care of the slaves you take care of whatever it was he was in full possession amen he's getting the spiritual part of this for he was a adopted into that family and his name on a check was just as good as his daddy's now what God has done the reason we see these things and know that there's something wrong friend look something wrong something wrong we see the promises of God we see it in the word of God but God has just began begun begin to my humble opinion to adopt his son now this is 19 55 what is this 20 almost 2024 we see the promises of God we see it in the word of God but God has just begun to my humble opinion to adopt his son positionally calling him out to one side giving him a certain Ministry anointing them for that purpose and sending them out watch what happens when he does Ephesians 1 ver4 according to he as chosen I want you every time we have this U part that I've got in yellow read it with me maybe it'll wake some of you up so I'm sorry wake up we're going to read this according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of world that that's weak this is your inheritance I get excited about my inheritance amen that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us not somebody else us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ what to himself to make sure it's going to happen he's not giving it to a second person or a third person of the Trinity he's doing it according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted and the Beloved amen wow in whom I didn't do this one but in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he ha what here's that word again abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence have he made known unto us the mystery of what he wants Done Right his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in a dispensation of the fullness of times what 2,000 years now today he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him whom also one more time we have obtained an inheritance remember Jesus didn't come to bring bring us an inheritance nope he did not he came to get us back to our inheritance our inheritance was before the foundation of the world now that's a direct quote from Brother random if you need it I if you need it I'll get it for you being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be what to the praise of his glory he loves us he wants to show the world us who first trusted in Christ in whom also trusted after that year we look after you heard the word of Truth you got to hear the word of Truth first if you just get told every Sunday that God sent a prophet and baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ and God sent a prophet and baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ you're missing a whole light so in whom you trusted after that you heard the word of Truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the what what's the Redemption of The perous Possession it's not only your soul when he claims you he claims all of you I just believe that when he claims you he claims every bit of you all right unto the praise of his glory Matthew 21:42 this where we at this morning Jesus said unto them do you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected now look Jesus we know was a master builder he was a sculptor all right he was building the church the same has become the head of the corner so now if they rejected the head they rejected the head which is him they rejected him he was the head where the body he's the head he's the headship he's the Chief Cornerstone and chief headstone he's chief of all right but he had to start right back down here on the day of Pentecost as a Cornerstone of the church to build it back up again all right we've been talking about that for a long time the same has become the head of the corner so he he never lost his headship right he just lost all that control up here but he started back down here because remember even in Paul's age excuse me John said you just started your age and you've already lost your first love they started denominate and having denominational ideas right there in the first church age when it was the fullness of the word of God Jesus had just been off the scene like years a few years they were already saying he wasn't God they were already saying that he was you know not Divine they were already saying these things sthus and different ones were making doctr that Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan well we know that's not true Bible said he was born what Emmanuel God With Us that's good enough for me the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth fruits thereof which is us the Gentiles and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder we'll we'll touch on that subject a little bit later on but I want you to watch who's whoever shall fall on this Stone what now look it says you'll be broken which would mean two pieces are broken but now whomsoever it shall fall it don't just break you it grinds you to Real Fine powder takes you right back to what you were before we'll get into that a little bit later but not not today Isaiah 28: 16 for those of you that uh are as old as I am and when Dad was bu building a house when we were building my house in 2002 we used lasers cuz man had developed the point where you can use a laser and we got my house like within like a quarter of an inch like for 300 ft right and Corners we would get the corners just right with that laser but back in the old times you used a plummet it looked like a top almost with a with a string on the end of it and you would nail it down and it would drop and when it would drop like that that was where your point of start was right Plum Bob is what we call it trying to say plum called a plum buum well they Ed to Plum it so now but now remember if you don't get your foundation right see the person that built the house before we did in the 30s it was a foot off from one end of the House of the other when we set that thing down on the real Foundation that we had you know done by laser the windows wouldn't close the doors wouldn't shut the the um drywall cracked that's how bad off it was because they would do it with a lot of times they do it with a glass of water there was no such thing as this beautiful little level thing they put a glass of water in the middle of the room and if it was level it was level but it might not be over under but it is right there but listen you see what happened when it sat down on a firm foundation though it cracked nothing's fit now is that's a way to start a house no you know what we did we had to tear all that drywall out we had to take all the windows out we had to take all the doors out and reframe everything that's the same way with the word of God if we don't get our foundation right if we don't get our foundation right the building will not stand therefore thus sayith the Lord behold I land in line for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation that he that believeth look shall not make haste judgment also will I lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the Refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding places now watch you want to you want do you want a promise from the Old Testament that your appointment with death has been disol there it is Verse 18 and your Covenant with Death Shall be disol and your agreement with hell shall not stand amen yes you ought to underline that one in your Bible that would be Isaiah 28:16 and 18 your Covenant with Death Shall be dis know what when you get all this right amen when you get the foundation right when you get the walls up right amen and your Covenant with Death Shall be disano and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scorge shall pass through in other words when what the enemy comes in like a flood God's already got a standard to raise up then you shall be Trot down by it the plummet means a level or a leveling tool or instrument all right what gets out of level false Doctrine I it's okay for me to do this you know what that's going to take you if it's not of God that way now let's read this real quick and then we'll we'll stop statue of perfect man is what we've been talking about for 130 something sermon he our Nations saying the things they are and making fun of these things and their own money the currency testifies that the Seal of the whole universe is God he's talking about the dollar bill if you turn the dollar bill over there's a pyramid with an eye on the top of it all right the allseeing eye all right see that eye standing up there above that on that dollar bill that's the Great Seal it never was put on the top of the pyramid they couldn't understand why the capping Stone was rejected the head Christ listen they couldn't take God in human flesh they didn't kill him for the for the good works he did they didn't kill him for the prayer lines they didn't kill him for that what they kill him for saying he was God right they killed him for saying he was God they're going to kill me and you maybe even kill our influence for saying that we're God made manifest in another form called a bride not a second person not a third person we're the person of God made manifest in another form called a bride now in building the virtues now look building this Monument building this stature see it starts off with the foundation stone Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do then we're waiting look wait now look this is all the virtues then we're waiting telling you what he said oh everybody believe God sent us a prophet okay just want to make sure that y'all had exit the building and somebody else come in now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and what were we talking about brother brownan said discipline was what we're needing for the statute of perfect man for adoption discipline he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir now look let's get I've been wanting to get to this for three weeks right in here right in here now he's pointing to the drawing that he's got on the board I'm sure he's got it on a chalk board all right right in here you see I got in between all these works now in the original picture there's waves coming down right here if you can find it we'll try to find it brother joob maybe you can find it the original picture that you drew there's little waves but why did he put that in there look in between all these Works in here here are these little waves come what is that the holy ghost look coming down through Christ see Holy Spirit now not the Holy Spirit at the bottom of the pyramid you've already got that right now we're looking at the fullness to where that that that gives you the seal now you're sealed in your soul at the day you're born again everybody with me you don't unseal it and seal it back up you're sealed until the day of your redemption in your soul so now God's working on our second realm memory reason conscious effects imagination to make it just like the soul realm hard to believe but that's exactly what adoption is and that's exactly what the change of body is going to take is that your memory is his memory come on somebody his thoughts are your thoughts his ways are your ways you said oh brother the Bible says we can't well the Bible just told us we were going to die and I think over there in Isaiah it says we're going to disan that doesn't the Bible tell us that we have an appointment with death right Bible says you have an appointment with death well you know you got a doctor appointment tomorrow you have to go just miss the appointment yeah that's how simple death is going to be destroyed just don't go to the appointment you've been appointed to die don't go the Bible says it's been disol don't away with don't have to go there anymore we just got to believe it the holy ghost coming down through Christ SE Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit above all this welding this together now welding everything cuz your souls already already welded so he's welding the rest of us together forget about the flesh it just does what the spirit tells it to do all right welding This Together building a what a perfect church for the what Capstone to cap it off and we'll get into that a little bit later but let's read this right here Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961 we'll stop right here I ain't got time to get the rest of it what happened next then came the Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost now look and still the church got small smaller in the minority and now it goes on until that has to get to such a perfect place as human beings when we say the word perfect we go all as brother Bob says wonky we go all wonky fied I made it f because we go perfect I'm telling you what the Bible says the Bible tells us to be perfect tells us how now it goes on until that has to get so much a perfect place until when that headstone finally comes it'll fit so perfect the church will be have to be in such a perfect shape until when Christ comes he fits right down on it so you see just speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit that's way down the line here yet the church remember if you was ever there Egypt span pyramid them stones weigh under in the sky weigh 100 tons so perfectly put together till the razor blade won't even fit between it hone to a perfect condition till it fits absolutely perfect without cement that's the way the church is going to have to be hone down the word honing the church discipline until when Christ comes to take the church the ministry that Church look the church will pick right up on it and will raise Luther Wesley Pentecost and go up in the Rapture to take the church up now let's just look at this chart real quick we've had it before with a lot of uh new ones hadn't seen this but this is kind of a a chart that we did to make sure we put everything together and we'll talk about that interval next time so you look at justification sanctification and the new birth that puts you in the body at Faith right everybody with me yes but now remember if you will read the book inter Veil which is in the 50s inter Veil brother Brown will take you the out of court inner Court holy of holies and then it seems like he brings you back out into the same court again so at being three stages of justification there's a there's a stage because brother R tells us and I think it was ah I can't remember I had to quote the other day where he talks about Justified I didn't do it I never done it then he continues on he said the real you never did it now see you don't understand that it's in your birth because you know the real you did it very fresh on your mind but through the word of God and what the honing we've come to a place to where we realize that the real me didn't do it that's what he said so so that justification has to come up higher into the Son of God Revelation which is through the church ages now that sanctification brother Ram you know we talk about um Paul says I Die daily well why do he need to Die daily if he's already born again that's right daily sanctification daily washing of the water of the world so that's what's happening in The Virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness in this stage of going up the pyramid we're trying to live a Sanctified life even better because remember this justification just cut off your past sins right this sanctification is the Luke where the unclean Spirit goes out comes back seeks rest findest none comes back cuz remember until here you're not B you're not sealed right you can stay right here for a long time and the devil can jump back on you and make you think you're religious he'll make you religious that's for sure but when you get to New Birth and get it sealed in then brother B said that's where you start at Faith then now you are an heir of God a baby see how this see these Shadows that Brothers put in here that's a b shadow of a baby that's your new birth but then you start again to where you say God forgive me not forgive me of that drink and smoking gambling I that ought went in sanctification but forgive me that I don't give you 100% forgive me that I don't discipline myself to give you everything I got and he's just to what forgive us we're going to need forgiveness right to the body change you said boy you talking about being perfect now you talk it's a paradox you can't help what goes in here but you can help what ST stays in there sanctification is the cleaning remember the dream sister Shepherd's dream remember where was she at she was standing right here at the new birth she was wondering about her birth read sh sister Shepherd's dream and blasphemous names she's standing right here now what did she see she saw a box that a man him was pouring water into this box right what was coming out trash you said oh I got rid on my TR no you did not you just realized you had trash right there amen you just realized you had trash you've been made aware your tutor and your Governor is saying hey there's more to this right let's go to the second grade third grade fourth grade let's get to this guy then get to this guy so he was pouring the water in the trash was what coming out running down the side over her feet showing that we still got trash so we need a daily sanctification to get rid of that trash and that's under the revelation of the Son of God but there is a special anointing that Holy Spirit is something special that many people are not going to be able to come to it's wonderful to feel the presence of God but when you feel the presence of God and you got Authority big difference big difference when God backs up what you said big difference that's showing maturity then we've got to see now as we continue through the statue of perfect man that there's three sons Nam Son of God Son of Man son of David Son of David's in the Millennium that's not to us but we got to get this right here right first we got to have the headstone brought back which is what the seals and that's the justification that the real you didn't do it that's the sanctification that I didn't do it I'm not it's not part of me and then we see the third one that anointing that that Holy Ghost is going to take us into Rapture everybody with me I hope you see that if you don't understand it uh please say something we brother Dale Drew this a long time ago so we're used to it but remember I I believe everything's done in stages everything everything's in stages your new births in stages your your growth development's in stages your your adoption is in stages I mean you think you just got Justified one time and that was it no we're humans you think you just got Sanctified one time no listen that's when you started having problems is when you got Sanctified that devil hated to leave your house remember God pleased to dwell the devil is too but they they both can't be in there at the same time but the son of man Ministry is let's just put it this way brother R's Ministry was in two parts he told us in the layout of see Church age brother George Quinn read it one of my most favorite quotes brother Brown said this message of Malachi for is to do two things right stay with me just for a second we'll close two things what one turn the hearts of of the children back to the fathers right all right and and then start your growth then the second part is to reveal the Thunders or the seals that was sealed up and he said it'll be these divinely reveal Myster truths that literally what literally change our body we've had a body change it started at the day that we got born again but you're going to stand one day and death going to climb up your sleeve and you're going to say uhuh no not today not tomorrow not the next day and then we going to step right over into eternity where the devil has never been we're going to go to a place that the devil has never been he's never been in eternity he's always been a time creature let's stand to our feet let's let's take communion you love the Lord amen but there's an interval that we got to talk about an interval means a period between two events or times and it's an amount of space all right and we'll look at that next time I preach whatever that whenever that is let's take communion all mind's clear you love the Lord then you got to love his people how do you love the Lord you love his people you love the Lord you love his people all right let's read if you want to pull it up there Brothers y'all can read with me for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood remember how do you get a testament there has to be a death of a testator all right so this new testament had to it required a death so he knew he was getting ready to die but he gave us an ordinance until he comes after the same manner he also took the cup which is up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood not blood of bulls and goats not the law the blood of the Lord Jesus this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily all right you see unworthily are in an unworthy manner okay shall be guilty of the body in Blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself okay stop for a minute we're going to have a moment of silence here in just a few minutes examine yourself if you've done wrong or you need to get something done brother Brown said ask God to forgive you take communion but you better go get it right all right everybody with me okay but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body me and you right for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep but you see that one side of it but we've seen people healed by taking communion all right for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world thank God he separated us from the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home remember what they were doing they were just bringing a big Feast together and they were getting drunk and they were calling at the Lord's table that was the Corinthians they didn't understand they were kids children so Paul said it in order said hey if you're going to eat something eat at the house this is going to be Bread and Wine made by holy hands is going to be taken in other words pretty much in sorrow more than it is sitting having a big Feast with all the big Po poers and and you know lamb and all that stuff no that's not what this is about and if any man hunger let him eat at home that that you come not into unto condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come so let's have a moment of silence before we take communion praying for each other sanctify us now Lord and bless us in the furtherment of this service in Jesus name amen Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father Lord this bread has been made Lord with just a couple of small ingredients Lord nothing added to it like the word should be father we pray that You' sanctify it Lord to our bodies and as we partake it Lord may we know that you were slain for us Lord and you died in your flesh Lord that we could have life father just bless it now in Jesus name amen you know when U Co hit and I'm sure they had them before but you know usually if something happens it Sparks you to do something you know or somebody to put something on the Internet so you know they they'd have these that you they deliver to your house and it'd be a cup of grape juice and it'd be a little old wafer sitting on top of it it's kind of like an inant communion thing you could get through Amazon or somebody you know but um they just don't get the real meaning I'd rather just wait and take it here amen I'd just rather wait and take cuz you know it was grape juice it wasn't wine they're not going to send alcohol through the through the uh post office but that's what they came up with and that's what they've come up with in years you know y'all know some of you had been here before for Mom and Dad used to be he was a deacon in the Baptist Church and she they' saved the she'd saved the little they'd be little wafers in a bag it'd be in a box like crackers almost like animal crackers you get out enough for that you knew people going to take it thought it out boy that was real fresh thought it out and what you didn't use you put it back in the little bag and put it in the freezer and used it for the next time we took communion and then Daddy would get to Welch's grape juice and he'd have to cut it for the Baptist you know a little bit so uh he but that's what they do they dilute the word of God they don't have a revelation uh sad to say but the Catholics have a little more Revelation on that than than they do at least just whine they ain't going to turn no wafer into the body I'll promise you that thank you dear heavenly father Lord this fruit of the Vine lord it's been made and now we really understand more about the process that it goes through that that it gets better and better Lord as it as it rots as we say and ferments Lord and you said if a corn of wheat dies and goes in the ground and abides alone it bring forth nothing but if it rots it brings forth more fruit Lord and I pray Lord today that as we partake of this communion that Lord we'll become better Christians that we'll become more of a servant for you father and that you'll bless us now in the ferment of this service in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest neath the Ever Green Tree I will carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected oh don't worry the world's not going to think anything about you and I wonder oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the river when I sing that song it's just so refreshing rest neath the evergreen tree I will carry my cross through the [Music] midnight come morning there's Glory for me ain't it refreshing to know that you can rest we haven't rested since the day we were born it's been a struggle and a fight even though you might take a day or two off and rest brother Donnie you're not resting your mind's going a th000 miles an hour brother John you know that you know you try to take a little time off and you're still what's going on over there I need to be and I need to and what about one day when Tomorrow Never comes you ain't got to worry about what's going on tomorrow cuz ain't a tomorrow and you don't worry about what you didn't do yesterday cuz there's no yesterday it's just ever present we don't understand that we're creatures of time we always have been until I mean the day we were born they write down what time we were born right you were born at 1:02 a.m. and that's stuck with you the rest of your life it's what time you were born so we're still a creature of time but we need to start thinking a little bit about eternity and what that is that you will enjoy and we don't know what that we we Joy the Bible says joy for the moment well that's joy for the moment down here there's no joy for the moment up there cuz there's not a moment it's just Joy all the time you know we have good days and bad days you all of us do young old doesn't matter we all have good days and bad days but what about a time when that just levels out oh somebody ought to shout when that just levels out and you you don't have to go oh that used to not that used to not hurt when I got up no it'll never hurt again it'll never never hurt again you'll never have to go get new teeth or a new ankle or a new leg or a new uh-uh praise God you can eat what you want too probably won't even be any toothpaste or toothbrush over there either I wouldn't think so I hope not either I don't like brushing my teeth H H the Apple eating an apple cleans it out that's not happened in the garden though bro it didn't don't many eating apples but we don't fathom that we laugh about it because we've never come under that but we've got to start thinking that that God's already got this thing settled out for us he's got it planned you know just for a moment I love my wife and I love her with all my heart I don't know how in the world that love could be any stronger and the joy that we have together sure we have our tough times but the joy that we have together with each other it's uncomparable brother Ram said that wasn't even a speck wasn't even a DOT remember he said it started with a trickle he kept going down to just a flowing river well that's what it'll be you say I don't want to lose my wife I I'd like to have her for eternity you'll have her for eternity but you'll love her more but you know what you'll do you'll love your neighbors as much as you love her too right so that's the love of God that equals everything out man's love is what give us all these ups and downs and this I like you and don't like you I can't it greates my cheese when somebody says oh I really like that person well you know why you really like that person cuz theyve done something you like that ain't liking that just liking cuz Adam Ain I liked it but God always loved us he never did not love us if we're a child of his we've been a child of his from the foundation of the world and we're going back to that Eternal peace that was lost in the fall yes but we got to do this first let's partake thank you Lord let's read the scripture now for the for the foot washing of the S so like I said is part of the ordinance of of um of what we do until he comes so in John 13 He says and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he red from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wiped them with a towel where withth he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now in other words Peter hang on a minute have some patience and you'll know this when I leave and come back onto day of Pentecost what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet boy Peter here we go Jesus answered and said real plain he said Peter if you don't let me wash your feet you'll have no part with me now Peter got a revelation yet right there there was going to be a separation that he wasn't going to be able to get back to if he didn't do what he was talking what the master was saying cuz he says over here you call me master and Lord you say well for so I am all right so Peter said if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter said unto the Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed neth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment was set down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you he's asking them a question a little question and answer session you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am now look they told he told him not to say that in his journey in his time he said give honor to the father I'm no good don't don't give me it but he said right here he's getting ready to come to a place he said you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am all right he's getting ready to leave if I then your master Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this day you've give us thank you for the Bride of Jesus Christ that stands before us today and Lord we've partaken of the communion Lord now we're going to the part of the foot washing Lord may we understand that that it's an ordinance that you said we need needed to do or we'd have no part with you what a strong set of words but Lord It's a servant heart it's it's getting down on your knees in front of another man and and or sister to sister and washing their feet and humbling ourself Lord that that this world would not do 99% of the world if you asked them to do that they would not do it because they can't humble theirself but Lord we humble oursel and is we always remember brother Tom Earnest Lord he's in your Mighty arms right now in the sixth Dimension Lord because of that stinking coid but Lord he's young again but he washed my feet one day he got down his hands and knees he looked at me he said it's an honor for me to wash your feet boy that stuck in my heart it's an honor for me to wash your feet and he meant it and Lord you meant it when you looked at your disciples and said you do this till I come father be with us Lord in the furth of this service and take care of us Lord on the Highway's home be with us Lord as we come back together on Tuesday now with brother Chris Long going to be with us that you'll give us a wonderful service and then continue to the next weekend father the many things that we've got to do may they be done for your honor and glory and be done with a purpose Lord to give you praise and honor and glory in Jesus name we pray amen here thism sisters downstairs be reverent [Music] [Music]
