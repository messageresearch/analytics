[0:20] you know
[0:22] okay Susan is let me let me um interpret
[0:27] that she was 57 yesterday
[0:29] oh yeah right actually I was 35. 57 good
[0:34] 3. hi Mom
[0:39] hi Mom
[0:41] hi Mom at least somebody's finally older
[0:44] than me
[0:46] that's correct
[0:49] well good to have everybody here for the
[0:52] game thanks again for all the ones that
[0:54] uh
[0:55] could help
[0:58] help while we've been gone we had a good
[0:59] time with brother Richards
[1:01] and um
[1:12] always
[1:14] feel good to be back home again
[1:16] let's turn the Book of Revelations
[1:17] unless we're going to finish the second
[1:19] seal today
[1:21] the question was raised at the end of
[1:23] the last time was was what does the
[1:25] second Seal have to do with
[1:27] our Redemption all right so we're going
[1:30] to cover that today
[1:32] all right we're going to read revelation
[1:35] 6.
[1:42] we're going to cover one and two today
[1:44] so we're going to put block one and two
[1:46] first first he'll take a seal and then
[1:49] next Sunday
[1:51] Lord willing next Sunday
[1:55] we'll be here yeah okay
[1:58] next weekend
[2:02] we will start on the third field so read
[2:05] start reading in your book the third
[2:07] film all right and everybody clear now
[2:12] what was happening in the natural part
[2:14] of the second seal
[2:16] it's pretty much written down here and
[2:18] you can pretty much go over it that it
[2:21] was
[2:23] during the Dark Ages
[2:26] that physically
[2:29] Christians were being killed but
[2:32] spiritually Untold Millions were being
[2:34] killed by the brown said billions
[2:37] because what had happened to this
[2:38] Antichrist Spirit it had now become a
[2:41] person a false prophet and had become
[2:44] I don't like to say incarnate because
[2:46] Satan is not going to be incarnate in a
[2:49] man until we leave
[2:51] because he doesn't know how to totally
[2:53] be incarnate in a person until he
[2:56] watches God being totally incarnate in
[2:59] his end time right all right
[3:02] because remember Satan's a copycat
[3:05] so this Antichrist with the spirit a
[3:07] little saying
[3:09] didn't it become a deed
[3:12] Doctrine and then all that but the false
[3:14] prophet
[3:16] was
[3:17] part of the second seal
[3:20] and it was during the Dark Ages it was
[3:23] the ox combat Beast
[3:25] Powell was given what a Doctrine they
[3:27] started preaching
[3:28] a Doctrine
[3:30] and the main Doctrine was
[3:33] kind of strange how that Doctrine gets
[3:35] back again like we were talking about
[3:36] the River Jordan Doctrine and
[3:38] and uh if you'll if some of you don't
[3:42] have that then I pulled off the internet
[3:43] from that man named corinthius
[3:46] most of you do any shaking your head if
[3:48] you don't then ask me and brother Joe
[3:50] will run it off the internet but if you
[3:51] look up man cyrinthia he's teaching the
[3:53] same thing that people are messing to
[3:55] teach them now what has happened
[3:59] that has come back in the end time
[4:02] because it's got to Incarnate a pope
[4:05] right
[4:07] got incarnate a pope in the end time so
[4:10] all these doctrines that started back in
[4:13] after Jesus was gone and after the
[4:15] apostles were killed off
[4:19] that same Spirit though those people are
[4:22] surrendous and those people are dead
[4:24] that same Spirit or that same Doctrine
[4:26] or that's that same devil is any end
[4:30] time
[4:31] see they had to deal in the in the first
[4:33] days they had to deal with the
[4:34] Antichrist Spirit a saying among the
[4:36] people when you got into this second age
[4:39] they actually physically put a man up
[4:41] there and put a crown on his head and
[4:43] said he is the biker of God he's the one
[4:45] that's going to take over he is going to
[4:47] be to us instead of God
[4:49] until then man started looking at a pope
[4:51] all right
[4:53] then you come over here and you look
[4:55] they got you got you got uh sayings
[4:58] Deeds Doctrine Doctrine then you're
[5:01] going to have incarnate false prophet a
[5:03] little bit later on
[5:04] because what Satan is going to do is
[5:06] he's going to totally take over a person
[5:08] now he's among the people just like God
[5:10] is but God's Gonna God's going to
[5:12] Incarnate a group of people
[5:15] if you're born again today you are God
[5:18] incarnate that's right but not to its
[5:21] fullness like I was preaching the other
[5:23] Sunday by partial to perfect you have a
[5:25] partial understanding you have a down
[5:26] payment you have the earnest of your
[5:28] inheritance which is what get this guy
[5:30] changed all right
[5:32] but let's go back to the second seal
[5:35] we see that it was a red horse so now
[5:38] the first horse was what white right
[5:41] a white righteous Church wrote out
[5:45] under the under the false pretense that
[5:48] they were correct which they weren't but
[5:51] there was a white righteous Church come
[5:53] out
[5:54] right right A.D 33 when the Holy Ghost
[5:57] fell that was a righteous group of
[5:59] people
[6:00] still have problems Peter and Paul still
[6:03] have problems in in doctrinal issues but
[6:07] they never want to kill each other
[6:10] like some people in a message do now
[6:12] they'd rather zap you out of him
[6:15] but that was then what was that doing
[6:18] that was bringing a group of people in
[6:19] the body
[6:21] because God rides first then this comes
[6:24] to combat it
[6:27] Satan's Satan's the one that comes after
[6:29] so God sent out a white righteous church
[6:32] God sent out a Blood Washed group of
[6:35] people
[6:36] God sent out of people that have been
[6:39] washed by the blood right
[6:43] but now watch this in the end time
[6:45] see they had to fight this in the first
[6:47] three ages they had to fight that in the
[6:50] first four ages look what we got to
[6:52] fight down here
[6:54] we got to fight the old guy
[6:56] we gotta fight the old guy that's got
[6:58] all that he's a little more he's kind of
[7:00] like the guy that's
[7:01] that's trained in the box or training to
[7:04] fight or or whatever you know or a
[7:06] rookie what we call a rookie I call him
[7:09] a rookie right here
[7:12] but now down here he's a pro
[7:14] he knows what he's doing
[7:16] the Bible said it would deceive the very
[7:18] elect if possible and it's not possible
[7:22] but brother Brown said it's going to be
[7:23] so close
[7:24] see so we got to be on our toes we got
[7:26] to be watching because it's not just the
[7:28] spirit it's not just a false prophet
[7:30] it's not just you know a system
[7:33] it's now in
[7:35] the highest form is the wrong in this
[7:39] message
[7:41] the message is not wrong right right
[7:43] message is perfect the message has been
[7:46] perfect since the first age I don't have
[7:49] the first stage up there the since the
[7:50] first days the message has been perfect
[7:54] God can't bring anything in her so so
[7:57] the message is perfect all right but
[8:00] what Satan does he he gets and puts a
[8:03] little this in this
[8:04] one's mine a little this and this one's
[8:06] mine and you know God Winks at the
[8:09] ignorance even even during this time
[8:11] here of Luther and Wesley were they
[8:12] still baptized under this same
[8:15] false teaching father son Holy Ghost
[8:17] never has been a right teaching okay
[8:21] everybody understand that God winked at
[8:23] their ignorance but it never was a right
[8:25] teaching
[8:26] the Trinity never was right right
[8:31] but Luther taught it and God filled him
[8:33] with the Holy Ghost
[8:35] because of Luther's ignorance
[8:38] of the word of God
[8:40] right right yeah Wesley's ignorance of
[8:42] the word of God even the Pentecostals
[8:44] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[8:47] the gift coming back into the church
[8:50] God still winked at that because why
[8:52] because why did God wink at that
[8:55] brother Brandon said if you'll read
[8:57] marriage and divorce
[8:59] he said because a misinterpreted
[9:01] theology
[9:03] we've got in this mess
[9:05] well marriage in divorce we know that
[9:07] was a natural happening and we've all
[9:09] been you know part of it uh we all were
[9:12] born married to somebody else whether
[9:15] we've ever physically married somebody
[9:16] else or not okay so we were married to
[9:19] the devil
[9:21] because of what happened a long time ago
[9:23] but still
[9:25] you and I have come to a place
[9:28] to where that's got to be struck out of
[9:31] us
[9:33] and the first and the and the most the
[9:36] the the best thing to strike it out of
[9:38] you is the boy
[9:41] the best thing to strike all that out of
[9:43] you is the blood Jesus sent the blood
[9:45] Jesus or Jesus came in flesh to shed his
[9:49] blood for Martin Luther even though he
[9:51] knew Martin Luther now Jesus the flesh
[9:53] man probably didn't sit there and say
[9:54] well Martin Luther but God had already
[9:56] spoken Jesus was the word of God all
[9:59] right all right when he went up and came
[10:02] back he had full uh understanding
[10:05] because he was God yet he was still man
[10:08] but he was what he was uh
[10:11] glorified I guess you want to say I want
[10:13] to say something out there he's
[10:14] glorified he's in the glorified
[10:16] condition so he knew all things
[10:18] and he knew Martin Luther was going to
[10:20] come he knew that Martin Luther was
[10:21] going to preach a a false Doctrine but
[10:24] yet there was truth to Luther God said
[10:27] okay I'm gonna wink at that because of
[10:29] it misinterpreted theology got these two
[10:31] started
[10:32] right
[10:34] misinterpreted theology got these two
[10:36] started don't think I talked to somebody
[10:39] one time before
[10:40] and just for a minute
[10:42] and
[10:43] he was kind of going I went through the
[10:46] co series down in Florida with them
[10:49] with brother Keith Brown and he happened
[10:51] to be there
[10:53] and he pulled me aside afterwards and he
[10:55] said you know he said and he's been the
[10:56] message wow
[10:58] and he said
[11:00] I never looked at he said I always
[11:02] looked at the seals as being all bad
[11:07] everything bad
[11:10] because it is
[11:12] you why horseriders you're destruction
[11:14] it you're a Jews being killed in the
[11:16] fifth if you took the literal and just
[11:18] read this down through here that's a
[11:20] it's a horrible happening
[11:22] there's not a lot good about it doesn't
[11:24] say like in the church ages it didn't
[11:26] kind of give you a little loudness as
[11:27] those who believe in other words
[11:29] I'll give them you know I'll write their
[11:31] name in the book and all that stuff but
[11:33] in this right here it says
[11:35] and when he had opened the second seal I
[11:37] heard the start second BC come and see
[11:39] and they went out another horse that was
[11:40] red and power's gun on him to what take
[11:42] peace from the earth kill one another
[11:44] and then we'll get on and him sword
[11:46] there was no way out
[11:48] bad
[11:49] he said I've always looked at the seals
[11:51] opening as being a bad happening
[11:55] well see I was teaching the seals as
[11:57] being justification sanctification
[11:59] baptism the Holy Ghost the opening of
[12:01] the word fifth seal Grace
[12:05] justification higher form six seal
[12:08] sanctification higher form where God
[12:10] burns your Earth off
[12:13] and then the seventh seal which is the
[12:15] Capstone which takes us out of him he
[12:17] said I've never seen it that way before
[12:18] so maybe that would help but see our
[12:21] mentality has been that man these are
[12:22] just horrible happening sure there is
[12:24] part this all part here sounds bad but
[12:28] remember the good part was there first
[12:30] that's right
[12:32] The Good the word of God was there first
[12:35] the people of God were there first the
[12:37] dolphins that were right were there
[12:39] first
[12:40] because you can't have
[12:42] like brother Brown said it's a very
[12:44] small statement but profound
[12:47] fish
[12:49] wouldn't need a gill if it didn't have
[12:51] water
[12:52] or a fan
[12:54] he said but God had to water there so
[12:56] the fish needed a fan what the water was
[12:58] already there
[12:59] so the word of God is already there
[13:01] these seals are for the Redemption of
[13:03] this guy right here not not these people
[13:06] in the Dark Ages
[13:08] not these people in age one two and
[13:10] three not five not six
[13:13] not even seven
[13:17] we come out of remember the seventh
[13:19] Church age this is still seven Church
[13:20] eight but we're going to be called out
[13:22] we're going to be in the eighth
[13:24] Eighth Day all right called up called
[13:27] out
[13:28] and after these things see in
[13:30] Revelations 4 1 you say well that's the
[13:32] rapture
[13:34] um
[13:35] you got to start here
[13:37] right you got to start here remember
[13:39] remember the Bible says after these
[13:42] things
[13:43] John looks up sees an Open Door see the
[13:46] open doors in the end time all this
[13:48] right here is what closed the door and
[13:49] the church agent this Antichrist spirit
[13:52] this man that comes up called the pope
[13:54] this incarnate false prophet all these
[13:56] things doctrines Deeds all that stuff
[13:58] that comes from the Devil
[14:02] but it is in opposition to what God's
[14:05] already doing to a group of people
[14:08] so these seals are not uh yes it's going
[14:11] to be a bad happening if you're in if
[14:13] you're in that group
[14:15] but
[14:17] if you come out of that it's a glorious
[14:20] thing
[14:21] the first seals you see what was a white
[14:24] righteous Church the devil was just he
[14:26] was in there deceiving
[14:28] yeah
[14:30] the white righteous church that turned
[14:32] the word down
[14:34] but the white righteous church that was
[14:37] born on the day of Pentecost
[14:39] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[14:42] that was a glorious group of people that
[14:44] truly was a white righteous group of
[14:47] people they had all these gifts working
[14:49] in their life
[14:54] do we
[14:56] are we are we so far back till we're not
[14:58] even the first church age
[15:00] but we're so far back that we're not
[15:02] even just like the 3 000 downstairs the
[15:04] Babbling babies at Pentecost they said
[15:06] men and brother what must we do to be
[15:08] saved
[15:09] or do we have these gifts working in our
[15:11] life
[15:12] that's the question you need to ask
[15:13] yourself because I can't answer that
[15:15] right okay
[15:17] but that's what happened God did send a
[15:19] white righteous church out and what did
[15:21] that do that justified a group of people
[15:24] you said well that's just not listen
[15:28] the Bible says those who is Justified
[15:31] he's already glorified
[15:35] because true listen true justification
[15:38] Nation
[15:39] will take you to the baptism of the Holy
[15:41] Ghost I said true justification
[15:44] now I believe this is just my this is my
[15:46] belief
[15:47] I believe that you can be justified in a
[15:51] in a a Baptist Church because you can
[15:54] say God it says in the Bible if you
[15:56] believe on Jesus Christ
[15:58] I know you can't believe on him like we
[16:00] believe on him because you got to have a
[16:01] holy ghost but the Bible says if you'll
[16:03] confess your sins God will save you
[16:08] remember brother Brown said they didn't
[16:10] have enough to go on to the next step
[16:11] they just get you and and what is
[16:14] justification it's just chopping off
[16:16] your past sins man Tempo was talking
[16:18] about yesterday or day before
[16:20] that's just chopping off your past sin
[16:22] that has nothing to do the smoking the
[16:25] drinking the the Corrals and that's
[16:27] still there right that's right but God
[16:29] has wiped your slate clean this is wide
[16:32] as this board right here from their back
[16:36] from there back
[16:38] and you say well that's true that's
[16:40] justification but if they don't go on
[16:42] any further brother Brown said you sin
[16:44] the next day you gotta
[16:46] you gotta ask forgiven that you got of
[16:48] course we have to keep asking
[16:49] forgiveness but those sins start heaping
[16:51] up
[16:52] why did the Bible say the unclean Spirit
[16:55] goes out at sanctification
[16:57] walketh and dry places findeth none
[16:59] coming back finds the place what swept
[17:02] and garnish now that's sanctification
[17:03] that's what we're talking about today
[17:04] because justification
[17:07] I'm not belittling the first three ages
[17:09] they were a powerful age
[17:12] but to me that was that white righteous
[17:14] church that made me and you white and
[17:16] righteous
[17:18] because I believe if that person dies
[17:21] and and truly repents
[17:25] and he dies a week later
[17:28] and he's in his walk and I see you got
[17:31] to look at the Providence of God
[17:32] Providence of God is that that man would
[17:34] never go any further but he truly did
[17:36] repent that's right now he's not Bride
[17:38] come on I want everybody to realize he
[17:41] is not bride
[17:44] only Holy Ghost filled people are bride
[17:47] so he's not bribe but if he dies he
[17:50] comes off that white Throne judgment
[17:52] he'd be given eternal life right
[17:55] because he had all that past forgiven
[17:59] but see that in the Bible then you say
[18:01] well those who he truly Justified he's
[18:03] also glorified
[18:05] that's not about true justification that
[18:07] because if you're if God see God's only
[18:09] one knows that we don't
[18:12] we don't know that we're going to go on
[18:14] God does right but he gives it to you
[18:17] and has it there for you
[18:19] why do you think we've come from all
[18:21] different places and I'm gonna come with
[18:22] this church and I'm talking about all
[18:23] different walks of life that's right and
[18:25] we walk up and go man
[18:28] I never heard that before
[18:31] Justified see that's as if you've never
[18:34] done it you know you did it
[18:36] I know I did what I did but God can't
[18:39] see that
[18:40] but see I went on to the baptism of Holy
[18:42] Ghost so now I can truly say I was truly
[18:46] Justified going on to the baptism of the
[18:48] Holy Ghost
[18:49] this is important he said well this
[18:51] ain't going to do with the seal yeah it
[18:52] does
[18:53] the first four seal that we're going to
[18:56] talk about here the first four seals
[18:57] gets us out of him right
[19:00] everybody understand that because
[19:02] Rapture happens in for sale
[19:05] right justification sanctification the
[19:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then us
[19:11] becoming the word and leaving here
[19:14] but now let me throw one more thing in
[19:16] you got to take five six and seven and
[19:18] put them right back in here
[19:21] everybody see what I'm doing that's
[19:23] right you gotta take five six and seven
[19:25] put them right back in here to change
[19:27] the body that's right sure it takes off
[19:29] seven all right
[19:31] if we were just gonna die and go by the
[19:33] grave we could do it before right right
[19:35] now does everybody understand that kind
[19:37] of that may be a little deep for
[19:38] something a little complicated
[19:40] okay but the first four seals gets you
[19:43] in the body of Christ if you're looking
[19:44] on the way we're gonna look at it okay
[19:46] not not that all this bad's gonna happen
[19:49] we got to go through the bad to show you
[19:51] the good that's right gotta go through
[19:54] the bad and show you the good brother
[19:55] Brown said to have a virtuous woman
[19:59] there had to be a prostitute to show
[20:02] that a virtuous woman could make it same
[20:04] way with the thief and Alive they had to
[20:06] be all that to show God all right so the
[20:09] same thing in your justification if
[20:10] you're truly Justified this morning your
[20:12] sins are gone
[20:16] now it's up to you to continue on
[20:19] continue on
[20:22] but if you make it to justification you
[20:24] can die and could be given eternal life
[20:27] I don't like that word could could be
[20:29] given
[20:30] because if you get to this stage of
[20:32] having the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[20:34] have eternal life you don't have to go
[20:35] get it that's right you don't have to
[20:37] worry about it ever ever that's why
[20:39] those who he has Justified
[20:42] he is already glorified if you're
[20:44] Justified Sanctified field the Holy
[20:45] Ghost this morning you're glorified
[20:48] what else are you going to need you say
[20:49] well what if I die
[20:51] you'll just get glorified before I do
[20:53] if I take the change without nothing
[20:55] you're just going to get glorified
[20:56] before I do because the dead and Christ
[20:57] shall rise first
[20:59] and then we which are alive and remain
[21:02] so she is not ashamed to pass on
[21:06] it's really not but you're just going to
[21:08] come up first but you yeah but you're
[21:11] going to come up because of somebody
[21:12] standing here that's alive that's right
[21:15] right somebody's got to be alive
[21:18] the resurrection message was not
[21:20] preached by a bunch of dead people
[21:21] no he has risen was by a bunch of alive
[21:24] people that said he's written Bill
[21:25] Martin what happens to that person
[21:27] that's Justified that doesn't receive
[21:30] only
[21:31] 59.
[21:33] yeah now see that's where I believe
[21:36] there's Dimensions inside of Dimension
[21:37] you say well how do you know that
[21:39] I'm using a quote by Brother Brown
[21:41] brother Brown wanted to know if Paul
[21:42] made it now he was in the sixth
[21:44] dimension
[21:45] right Paul was a born-again Believer and
[21:49] he was also in a sixth Dimension but
[21:51] brother Brown couldn't see him because
[21:53] if not he would have walked up and said
[21:54] hey I saw Paul Irene is my no I believe
[21:57] each age is put in a section
[21:59] there's sections inside and yes I don't
[22:02] they will not go to sixth Dimension
[22:03] because the only people kind of loud
[22:05] today I'm preaching kind of loud today
[22:07] sorry but those only that are born again
[22:10] are going to be in the sixth Dimension
[22:12] that's proven a fact right brother
[22:14] random went to the sixth Dimension that
[22:16] was Holy Ghost Philippines only
[22:19] Fifth Dimension I believe bro Martin
[22:21] made the place that they go in The Fifth
[22:23] Dimension I don't I don't know whether
[22:24] God sets them aside or
[22:26] or the maintenance out of Dimension but
[22:28] I don't think they're tormented like the
[22:31] ones in the Fifth Dimension that just
[22:32] went you know centers went to the
[22:36] dimension would there still be a
[22:37] paradise side of hell like there was
[22:40] before you could you could say that you
[22:42] could say that before you understand
[22:43] what you're saying you know though with
[22:44] the paradise because the blood didn't
[22:46] come with blood Jesus had not come to
[22:48] cover them yet so the blood of bulls and
[22:50] goats covered them they were putting
[22:51] them I just believe there's not just
[22:52] seven dimensions like Daddy was
[22:54] preaching you know you got eight
[22:55] Dimensions you got you you know you got
[22:57] you got different things
[23:00] but his Dimensions inside a dimension
[23:02] because remember what do we live in
[23:05] we live in three dimensions
[23:07] life life matter
[23:09] right so we conduct our business in
[23:12] three dimensions the fourth dimension is
[23:14] television radio cell phones
[23:18] anything with weight you know brother
[23:21] Graham called him either ways I don't
[23:22] think they use ether tubes anymore but
[23:24] we can say it's a chip Dimension now so
[23:27] a microchip dimensions
[23:31] but if you're born again we don't have
[23:33] to worry about that but but we can't
[23:35] assume that everybody's born again
[23:37] but we can't assume that we can all say
[23:39] God forgive me of my sins
[23:42] forgive me of my past
[23:44] and then walk on
[23:48] you decide
[23:50] whether you make it the sanctification
[23:52] and then it's sanctification just like
[23:53] we're at now
[23:58] that's where that bloody red horse rode
[24:02] through
[24:04] these dark ages
[24:07] but that's
[24:09] that sanctification I'm trying to work
[24:11] this right that sanctification was their
[24:13] Holy Ghost
[24:14] just like Luther's justification Was His
[24:17] Holy Ghost
[24:18] never understand that God winked at
[24:21] Luther's ignorance because what man had
[24:23] taught
[24:24] see the miss the grace of God these
[24:26] seals are the grace of God every seal is
[24:29] Grace you say on the fifth silver
[24:30] brother said the fifth seal was showing
[24:32] the grace of God right to a group of
[24:36] people that didn't want him well guess
[24:37] what you and I were a group of people in
[24:38] the morning right we're going to get
[24:40] into that in the Fairfield we didn't
[24:41] want to be saved I didn't right I didn't
[24:44] want to be saved
[24:46] oh yeah you did you come
[24:49] why did I come
[24:51] something inside of me grooming called
[24:53] me all right that's right like I said
[24:56] before I told the mountain in Kansas
[25:00] you know you've got to hear the word of
[25:02] God before you are convicted you can't
[25:04] just you say well my Grandmama talked
[25:06] what'd she tell you about rocks and
[25:08] trees no she told you about the word of
[25:09] God
[25:10] you need to go to church you need to get
[25:12] saved you need not to do this you need
[25:13] to not do that what was she doing she
[25:16] wasn't reading you a scripture that's
[25:19] right she was the word
[25:22] telling you
[25:24] if you didn't have to read it
[25:28] we're written epistle
[25:33] I mean really
[25:34] if you got to quote people scripture
[25:38] if you got to quote quotes all the time
[25:40] I know we're supposed to but aren't we
[25:42] supposed to be the Living Word of God to
[25:43] where we say hey this happened in my
[25:45] life right
[25:47] I mean we can read where Paul and we
[25:49] were going to read today but we won't
[25:50] Man Gordon wants to go this way where
[25:53] Paul says I Die daily well that's a
[25:55] higher form of sanctification
[26:00] surprise
[26:02] all right clear you clear your computers
[26:07] hit delete
[26:08] no don't hit delete hit save
[26:13] saved
[26:15] hit save You're Gonna Save that over
[26:17] because we're going to talk about now
[26:18] let's go back to this the first seal
[26:21] with the white righteous church if
[26:22] you're truly Justified
[26:24] you're just as righteous brother Brown
[26:26] said that you've never done that
[26:29] in God's eyes
[26:31] in the devil's eyes he still
[26:34] riding through all this he's still on
[26:36] these horses people just because you're
[26:39] not the Holy Ghost don't mean you killed
[26:40] that horse no right because what's
[26:44] happened now his Doctrine
[26:47] is being put in force that's right it's
[26:51] Doctrine Satan's Doctrine he's got a
[26:53] Doctrine it's being put in for us but
[26:56] remember God's doctrines first then he
[26:59] said there's no weapon formed
[27:03] let them stand against you because God
[27:07] gave Satan
[27:09] he didn't give him the sword or he'd had
[27:11] to give him the word he gave him an
[27:13] opportunity
[27:14] to pervert it
[27:17] okay and that's what he done Satan did
[27:20] but as he did that God also give us a
[27:24] sword
[27:26] and what does the sword usually do
[27:28] hurts
[27:30] Cuts draws blood right
[27:34] never seen many nice knife fights
[27:37] if you if you don't see any nice night
[27:40] fights where they go I'm gonna cut you
[27:45] no they go for whatever they can go for
[27:48] go throw whatever right yeah so that's
[27:53] what the word of God's doing in
[27:54] justification you're just kind of uh in
[27:58] my experience I was just kind of I was I
[28:00] felt empty I felt you know I felt like
[28:02] all the burdens of my sin had been gone
[28:07] but they don't desire to do first one
[28:09] thing in another name it you you're
[28:11] related to your life it was still there
[28:13] except for one thing and I don't know
[28:15] why God took that away from me instantly
[28:18] and that was using tobacco chewing
[28:20] tobacco snuff and all that because the
[28:23] very day that I came to church and give
[28:25] my heart to God the next day I didn't
[28:27] want him anymore it just went away
[28:30] uh and that don't happen you people that
[28:32] smoke you people that's just you know
[28:34] used stuff it just don't go away
[28:36] they just don't but mine did
[28:39] I mean I had cans of that stuff laying
[28:41] everywhere and Jim companion I had it
[28:42] all over the house kept one in my pocket
[28:44] one in my briefcase going to work
[28:46] got some at work
[28:48] it was just like it had never happened
[28:50] before
[28:52] and that's not normal
[28:55] but see God did that for me because he
[28:57] knew it probably would be hard and would
[28:59] hinder me if if I kept on but even in my
[29:02] Justified condition I believe God took
[29:04] that away from me we said well that's
[29:05] sanctification look people
[29:08] yeah people rather than sisters this is
[29:11] not just
[29:14] and that's just in case that came back
[29:16] to him and Holy Ghost it's not
[29:18] justification
[29:19] you're done with that yeah
[29:21] sanctification you're done with that
[29:23] it's just like those
[29:24] those uh virtues that line is there just
[29:29] in a picture
[29:31] if you were to draw that you'd have to
[29:33] put Faith all over that pyramid you'd
[29:36] have to put virtue all over that pyramid
[29:37] you'd have to put knowledge Temperance
[29:40] patients all over the pyramid not just
[29:42] you get one and then no
[29:45] now listen there is a finality to that
[29:48] there is a time when God says okay
[29:50] you've done that right you've got virtue
[29:54] but he don't quit adding virtue right no
[29:58] no but you've reached a position okay
[30:03] same thing with justification you reach
[30:05] a place to where you know that God's
[30:08] forgive you your sins
[30:09] and you know how you know that you trust
[30:11] in what he said right
[30:13] he said I am just to forgive you
[30:17] and he said that just to fire him and
[30:21] the Justified I'm quoting scripture are
[30:24] one
[30:26] the justifier
[30:28] and the Justified are one that's right
[30:30] don't be truly Justified
[30:33] you're already glorified because God
[30:35] knows you're going to go on to receive
[30:36] the baptismal but you've got to do it in
[30:39] stages yes now if Christians have sins
[30:42] then you can't do away with
[30:44] justification
[30:47] you have to steal that God forgive me of
[30:49] what I did forgive me of this forgive me
[30:51] of that
[30:52] you know I want to give you a little
[30:53] testimony um brother Tim he'd come we're
[30:56] riding you know work
[30:58] we talked a little bit and he looked at
[31:00] me one day and he said I'm saved thank
[31:03] you and I believe I'm safe I said well
[31:05] that's what you got to do you got to
[31:07] First believe
[31:08] that you're safe
[31:10] don't don't worry about the devil and
[31:12] what you know you say oh well
[31:18] uh smoking and drinking and looking at
[31:21] naked women and you know all that stuff
[31:24] so yeah you're human that's right it
[31:28] still bothers me I mean they're smoking
[31:29] and drinking part but pretty woman I'm
[31:31] sorry I just always bothers you
[31:33] you quit looking at one you look over
[31:35] here and you see them
[31:37] that's less much worse than the one you
[31:39] turned from
[31:41] so you just you can't always look up or
[31:43] you have a wreck so you just have to
[31:46] believe though that you say Lord forgive
[31:48] me any thought that comes through my
[31:49] mind God forgive me now see the
[31:52] difference is if you sit there and dwell
[31:53] on that thought like you used to right
[31:58] same way with you women that's right you
[32:00] want to dress the man or the man
[32:02] undressed woman with your eyes you got a
[32:03] problem you're committing adultery is
[32:06] what God Said right
[32:09] but you can't help from that thought to
[32:11] come across but you can help
[32:13] kicking it out not let it build a case
[32:16] that's right see that's the difference
[32:19] in a Justified condition you say God my
[32:21] sins are forgiven the devil says I'll
[32:24] drive by places and he'll say you did
[32:25] this here and you did this here and you
[32:27] did this thing
[32:29] yeah and I just say
[32:31] no not this guy did it that's right the
[32:34] one that's riding today didn't do that
[32:37] we were trapped into it the prophet said
[32:39] but we got to start so in justification
[32:42] in that first church age that was a
[32:44] white righteous Church they had the Holy
[32:47] Ghost they had the gift working
[32:49] but it's a form of justification because
[32:52] we've got to go to the higher form of
[32:54] justification to where we know
[32:57] there's got to come a place to where you
[32:58] know that you're not even going to worry
[32:59] about that past God's already put in to
[33:01] see it forgetfulness
[33:03] like brother Keith reset and put a no
[33:05] fishing sign up
[33:07] so nobody needs to go fishing right yeah
[33:10] if God pushing them to see it
[33:11] forgetfulness don't go fishing it out
[33:14] okay which is a good point but now
[33:17] sanctification is what we were going to
[33:18] talk on today we got about two minutes
[33:21] so
[33:22] sanctification is what the blood the
[33:25] blood sanctifies you
[33:27] that's the only thing it does now that
[33:29] cleans you and sets you a sign for
[33:31] service in other words the smoking ought
[33:33] to go out see everybody said well what's
[33:35] your experience well boy when I got born
[33:36] again everything went out
[33:40] that may be true let me not be so
[33:43] dogmatic because I believe you can be
[33:45] justified Sanctified filled with a holy
[33:47] ghost in One sermon
[33:50] in one sermon because the 3 000
[33:52] downstairs and at the day of Pentecost
[33:55] they heard one sermon and they went
[33:57] through justification sanctification and
[33:59] received a holy ghost in One sermon but
[34:02] now for some that's bullheaded and
[34:03] hardheaded like me it took a while so
[34:06] let's just say we're all bullheaded and
[34:08] it takes us a while all right so we're
[34:10] Justified
[34:12] all right white righteous if you're
[34:14] truly Justified God looks at you as
[34:16] righteous
[34:17] because he can't hold anything against
[34:19] you
[34:21] or your Center in his eyes
[34:24] does everybody understand that
[34:25] in his eyes so he's clean your slave
[34:29] but then you start sinning again because
[34:31] the unclean Spirit has not left yet
[34:34] all right throw my spirits now but now
[34:37] in sanctification though you start
[34:39] walking through life and it may take you
[34:41] a year two years you know what it may
[34:43] take you 20 years
[34:46] you may fall back
[34:53] Joe what
[34:57] you're here you're alive you can do
[34:59] something about it now if you died and
[35:00] went on you've done you've done your
[35:02] judgment but you're still alive you're
[35:04] still here and you're still able to say
[35:06] God forgive me of that all right
[35:09] cut out the drinking one day you're
[35:11] going to realize hey
[35:13] that thing's gone
[35:16] and I don't even want it anymore
[35:19] or the or the are the commitment
[35:21] adultery or whatever just name I mean
[35:23] you know let's just sin is unbelief it's
[35:25] just not believing that you're
[35:27] Sanctified right right you just don't
[35:30] believe you're Sanctified that's the
[35:32] whole thing it ain't that I quit doing
[35:33] this and quit doing that it's just you
[35:35] didn't believe
[35:36] you say I'm believing but you know what
[35:38] you're doing and sanctification to me in
[35:40] justification you're just like a fish
[35:42] out of water you really don't know how
[35:43] to handle things but when you come to
[35:45] sanctification
[35:47] and this is not do's and don'ts we got
[35:49] one minute this is not do's and don'ts
[35:50] all right but you do start going to
[35:52] church
[35:54] can't get it anywhere else right you do
[35:57] start having different friends
[36:00] because your separation
[36:03] of what they've been doing and what
[36:04] you're doing
[36:05] you see that now as condemnation and you
[36:08] draw away from it
[36:10] start getting around believers
[36:13] because you got what you got to find
[36:14] somebody with some virtue before you can
[36:17] draw it from you gotta so you gotta
[36:19] start doing the things to me
[36:21] sanctification is the do's and don'ts
[36:23] not the holy ghost that would say well I
[36:25] got the Holy Ghost because I quit
[36:26] drinking no no that should have went out
[36:28] at sanctification brother random teaches
[36:30] that he never teaches that the Holy
[36:31] Ghost is getting rid of the smoking the
[36:33] drinking and adultery and all that stuff
[36:35] he said that's a sanctification because
[36:36] even the Bible says we may do it next
[36:38] Sunday but we got to go the unclean
[36:40] Spirit goes out at sanctification walks
[36:43] and driving places find seek a fresh
[36:44] mind of none
[36:46] but he's going to come back
[36:48] right that's right he's going to come
[36:50] back and he's going to do this right
[36:51] here he's going to give you an
[36:53] antichrist Spirit if you don't watch
[36:55] what you're doing yeah
[36:58] and tell you one dude first for for uh I
[37:02] don't hardly ever give you a lesson Look
[37:04] up the word justification and
[37:06] sanctification it's the dictionary and
[37:09] bring them with me I want to see them
[37:11] dictionary thesaurus whatever you want
[37:13] to do justification and sanctification
[37:15] or Sanctified or Justified either one
[37:17] doesn't matter
