[17:00] really see him through the eyes of faith
[17:03] what you look at what you're studying
[17:05] what you're what you're really gazed
[17:07] intently upon is what you end up

[19:07] this chapter the Bible says in the voice
[19:09] which I heard from heaven spake on to me
[19:12] again ain't you glad he spake unto us
[19:15] again there's seven thunder voices spoke
[19:17] from heaven but John says after he heard
[19:19] that voice he spake to him again
[19:22] amen that's right we need to Lord Jesus
[19:25] to speak to us praise God and said go
[19:29] and take the little book what book you
[19:32] think that is go and take this book go
[19:36] and take the little book which is open
[19:40] is it a sealed book or is it on sealed
[19:42] book is it a closed book or non open
[19:45] book
[19:46] take the book which is open in the hand
[19:49] of the angel which standeth upon the sea
[19:51] and upon the earth and we know what
[19:53] angel that is right king theophany jesus
[19:56] christ and i went on to the little angel
[19:59] and said unto him give me the little
[20:01] book he kind of says that brother wait
[20:04] reminds me of something it's almost like
[20:05] it belonged to him because he was Togo

[20:19] Redemption amen is that book belong to
[20:22] you there's that book written about you
[20:25] amen
[20:26] and then went on said angels said onto
[20:28] him give me the little book and he said
[20:31] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[20:33] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[20:35] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I
[20:38] took the little book out of the Angels
[20:40] hand and ate it up and it was exactly
[20:43] like the angel said it would be and it
[20:46] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[20:49] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[20:51] bitter he got he got to digest in that
[20:54] word after awhile and he said unto me
[20:57] thou must prophesy again before many
[21:01] peoples and nations and tongues and
[21:04] kings let's pray our dear gracious
[21:07] Heavenly Father God we love you this
[21:09] morning we thank you Father for
[21:11] gathering us to
[21:12] in good health and strength and all
[21:14] those that couldn't be here father we
[21:15] ask that you send your healing angel
[21:17] Lord to sweep through their homes father
[21:19] and wherever they are grant your touch I
[21:22] pray and these that are sitting present
[21:23] father we just ask for the liberty of
[21:25] your Holy Spirit to come take this word
[21:28] God and so quicken it to our hearts that
[21:31] Christ can truly take flesh in us Lord
[21:34] that the mystery that you had in the
[21:36] back part of your mind can now come into
[21:38] their humble little lives of our selves
[21:40] father and be expressed
[21:42] so set forth and so real and such a
[21:45] blessed reality of your presence and and
[21:47] you take in flesh in us Lord God so we
[21:49] can be changed your prophet said Lord
[21:52] that Jesus will be so into their bodies
[21:55] he'd be able to change them father we
[21:57] know that's the promise of this age
[21:59] that's what we're looking at that's what
[22:00] we've been led up to to see that part of
[22:03] the word is now to be expressed and
[22:05] interpreted by you blessing father we
[22:07] ask him pray your touch today in Jesus
[22:09] Christ's name on each and every one
[22:11] amen and God bless you all so much you
[22:13] can be seated
[22:14] god bless your your precious pastor and
[22:17] all you dear minister and brethren here
[22:19] I really always appreciate this church
[22:20] and the support it's really blessed to
[22:23] have this kind of fellowship here you
[22:25] know you got brother Bob black right you
[22:29] got brother Aaron Roberts there you got
[22:31] brother Louise if there's any other
[22:33] ministers here god bless you so much we
[22:35] appreciate you this is an hour that the
[22:38] that the bride really needs to be
[22:40] pressing in this is an hour that
[22:42] ministers need to be ministering people
[22:45] need to be expressing the divine
[22:47] revelation of Christ they've been
[22:48] because faith comes by hearing and
[22:51] hearing by the Word of God there's been
[22:53] so many times in my life brothers
[22:54] sisters where the Holy Spirit has
[22:56] blessed men and abled me to glean from
[22:58] ministers to glean from the Prophet
[23:00] messenger of the age because it's all
[23:03] the anointing of the Lord and the word
[23:05] of the Lord coming together through
[23:07] gifts and operations of the Spirit to
[23:09] benefit and bless our lives to benefit
[23:12] and bless our faith is that right so my
[23:15] prophet was walking through the woods
[23:17] one time and stepped over a cigarette
[23:18] pack and the Lord said go back and pick
[23:21] that up and he said huh not me
[23:23] and their lords toad brother brand go
[23:25] back and pick that up brother Brendan
[23:27] went back and picked up a cigarette pack
[23:29] and the Lord spoke to him and gave him a
[23:31] message
[23:32] you know what message I was thinking
[23:34] man's filter brethren got a message and
[23:38] got inspired because the Holy Spirit the
[23:40] Lord was directing him and I believe the
[23:44] bridesmaid of the same kind of material
[23:46] the bride can catch inspiration the
[23:49] bride can catch the revelation of faith
[23:51] because she's ordained as a vessel to be
[23:54] inspired of the Lord in that way is that
[23:57] right how many's gleaned revelation off
[23:59] the record sermons of a vindicated
[24:01] prophet our whole lives
[24:03] do I need to stand up here for the next
[24:05] two hours and say hey press play press
[24:07] play God sent a prophet you already know
[24:10] that we're supposed to get into the
[24:12] message and the message is supposed to
[24:14] get into us and the word is supposed to
[24:17] become spirit in life into people amen
[24:20] the great payoff of God sending a
[24:22] prophet is an endtime bride and I chose
[24:26] our pastors today to try to express
[24:29] underscore and highlight this simple
[24:31] principle and I'm sure you've heard it
[24:33] ministered on but I just want to kind of
[24:35] highlight it today if you notice brother
[24:39] Branham often referred to revelations
[24:41] 10-7 is that right and he told us showed
[24:45] us this scripture that the one that came
[24:48] down from heaven with the rainbow around
[24:50] his head was Jesus Christ he put one
[24:53] foot on the land one foot on the sea and
[24:55] we know the image of the beast comes out
[24:57] of the land and the beast came out of
[24:58] the sea so the Lord Jesus put his feet
[25:01] on these two things right here and
[25:03] brother brems says foot steps means
[25:05] possession so the Lord Jesus Christ is
[25:08] exercised and expressed in our book of
[25:11] symbols how he has total dominion over
[25:14] Jezebel and Ahab he's got total dominion
[25:16] over church and state he's got total
[25:19] dominion over Rome in the United States
[25:20] so there ain't no big back beast and
[25:23] there ain't no big bad image of the
[25:24] Beast is gonna hurt this bride because
[25:27] the bride's husband the word Jesus
[25:29] Christ has got a conquered just like
[25:32] when David went
[25:33] son that stone at the giant Goliath he
[25:37] hit the ground so hard it must have
[25:39] shook over around and in David when the
[25:42] Bible says David stood on top of glass
[25:43] and cut his head off is that right
[25:46] that's right so he conquered that and
[25:49] that serpent seed devil and art David in
[25:53] these last days has come forth been
[25:55] introduced by vindicated prophet because
[25:57] truly the vindication of John the
[25:59] Baptist was Christ on presence himself
[26:01] and the vindication of brother Benno's
[26:03] ministry is Christ himself coming forth
[26:06] and I believe with all my heart this
[26:08] worldwide bride is led by Christ you
[26:12] believe that they've been brother
[26:15] Branham fulfilled the one man ministry
[26:18] he's the fulfillment of that one man
[26:21] ordained for the Aged and brother
[26:23] Branham was everybody's pastor brother
[26:26] branch said Elijah was Jezebel's pastor
[26:28] so brother brand is a pastor of
[26:30] everybody in this age so when you when
[26:33] people claim brother branham's my pastor
[26:35] we know what they're mean and they're
[26:37] mean and they don't really go along with
[26:39] any other pastor but brother Browns
[26:41] their pastor well when you think about
[26:43] it in the light of what brother Branham
[26:44] said it ain't saying much cuz Jezebel
[26:47] was under the headship of Elijah Pope
[26:51] Francis is under the headship of William
[26:54] man Branham so brother Branham is a
[26:57] Pope's pastor God spoke through the
[26:59] mouthpiece in these last days and that's
[27:02] God's voice to everybody that's God's
[27:05] voice to the world but we know only the
[27:07] bride can actually pick up what the
[27:09] husband is saying is that right only the
[27:12] bride could come under perfect and
[27:14] complete headship to that word so all
[27:18] kinds of people claim brother Branham as
[27:20] their daddy is that right
[27:23] and Abraham's the father of our faith is
[27:26] that right but there's a difference
[27:29] between being in church and being in
[27:31] Christ there's a difference between
[27:33] claiming to be in the message and
[27:35] actually being in the faith is that
[27:38] right
[27:39] so I wanted to express today how there's
[27:41] this tremendous thing that the Lord's
[27:43] showed us through the years
[27:45] about this time where the scripture is
[27:49] read like when Jesus went into the
[27:51] synagogue they gave him the the scroll
[27:54] of Isaiah Isaiah is 66 chapters and
[27:58] brother Graham Tata said Isaiah
[27:59] represents the whole Canon of Scripture
[28:01] so when Jesus went into the synagogue as
[28:04] this custom was they handed to him the
[28:06] scroll of Isaiah and the Bible says
[28:08] Jesus found where it was written st.
[28:12] Luke chapter 4 verse 17 he found where
[28:15] it was written and what was written was
[28:17] written of himself what he would do in
[28:20] that hour the Lord Jesus was dealing
[28:22] with a present truth a particular part
[28:25] of the word brothers and sisters that
[28:28] God was making come to pass right there
[28:30] in the present hour now that is
[28:33] extremely important because we all see
[28:35] brother Brennan is part of the prophecy
[28:37] we all see that God sent Eliezer to call
[28:41] out a bride we all see brother Branham
[28:43] was sent by God but there's more
[28:45] scripture when you look up this part of
[28:49] the scripture and find places where
[28:50] brother Branham referred to it there's
[28:52] only a couple places but so many message
[28:55] focused stopped at revelations 10-7 that
[28:58] there's more scripture there's rest of
[29:01] the chapter
[29:02] revelations 10-7 was brother branham's
[29:04] part but there's another part there's
[29:07] other scripture when the Lord Jesus read
[29:10] the part of the word that he read that
[29:11] was the word for that very hour but
[29:13] there's more prophesy for other hours
[29:15] coming after that is that right so
[29:18] whenever you read the part that Jesus
[29:20] fulfilled the Holy Spirit reveals to you
[29:23] the power and the influence of that
[29:25] impacts our lives of the part that's
[29:28] already been fulfilled well what about
[29:30] the influence of the word that he's
[29:32] fulfilling right now are you conscience
[29:35] are you aware of what part of the words
[29:37] being interpreted in our lives right now
[29:39] because you see God sent a prophet and
[29:42] the Lord took him home in 1965 but
[29:45] what's been happening between 1965 and
[29:46] 2019 what part of the Bible can you
[29:50] identify is the word being interpreted
[29:53] in those days in your day
[29:56] many of us here are born after brother
[29:59] Branham was taken home I was born in
[30:01] 1970 isn't there any scripture
[30:03] pertaining to these days huh because it
[30:07] was so important in the days of Jesus
[30:09] for people to be conscience of what part
[30:12] of the word God was manifesting right
[30:14] there for had they missed it they missed
[30:16] eternal life that's right to walk in the
[30:20] consciousness of what part of the word
[30:21] God is making manifest in your hour is
[30:24] connected to knowing God not knowing of
[30:27] him not just reading the historical idea
[30:30] about him but actually knowing him to
[30:33] know Christ is actually know him
[30:36] personally to know him personally is to
[30:39] recognize that he's alive and that he is
[30:41] fulfilling some part of the word today
[30:45] what part is that
[30:47] I asked message folks sometimes did you
[30:49] know brother Graham was sent to restore
[30:50] the faith of the Apostles a made in
[30:53] Malachi 4 I believe it well what's the
[30:56] faith of the Apostles I thought using
[31:04] the message man because so many people
[31:08] today say well we don't understand that
[31:10] we just believe it well brother Brian
[31:12] said a true eagle will understand the
[31:14] message true Eagles understand Daniels
[31:17] 70th week - Eagles understand marriage
[31:20] and divorce torito's understand
[31:22] predestination election adoption because
[31:26] the Holy Spirit Christ is here to lead
[31:28] guides read the word them the bride in
[31:31] and through the word so I wanted to
[31:35] share this passage to show you don't
[31:37] make the mistake that so many people
[31:39] make they're scared to not read more
[31:42] scripture because brother Branham really
[31:44] didn't deal with that you'd be surprised
[31:47] with brother Branham dealt with that's
[31:48] just hidden right there in that message
[31:50] in the message called marriage of the
[31:53] Lamb brother Branham actually referred
[31:55] to memucan in the first chapter of
[31:56] Esther but he never called him by name
[31:58] brother Branham just referenced him and
[32:00] said but there was a man there with some
[32:02] wisdom about him
[32:04] and many ken was the seventh prince that
[32:08] sat in the presence of the king and he
[32:10] brought an indictment against Vashti you
[32:13] or does that remind you of somebody
[32:14] today somebody bring an indictment
[32:16] against Jezebel somebody bring an
[32:18] indictment against the church and in the
[32:20] first chapter of Esther you find the
[32:22] seventh prince bringing a message of
[32:24] indictment against a woman and then the
[32:27] king was so pleased with the amendment
[32:29] consent
[32:29] he had his message translated all the
[32:32] known tongues and sent around the world
[32:34] does that remind you of anybody
[32:37] first chapter of Esther brother Branham
[32:40] never brought that out but I want a
[32:42] message believer to deny that part of
[32:44] the scripture you can't it's right there
[32:47] in plain sight there's many places
[32:50] brother Branham took us to and then the
[32:53] idea was for you to pick up from there
[32:55] dig down in it because where the ban was
[32:58] sent to reveal there's a lot of thing he
[33:00] never explained he was just sent to
[33:02] reveal by the spoken word under the
[33:04] power and influence of the Holy Ghost
[33:06] the spoken word would shed light on the
[33:08] written word and you as a message
[33:11] believer are supposed to take that spoke
[33:13] and work back to the Bible and come to
[33:15] real faith is that right because we know
[33:19] that there's things hid in the word that
[33:24] pertain to us is that right because when
[33:27] you find you believe brother branham's
[33:29] wrote up in the Bible we had a little
[33:31] Bible study with Bob's family the other
[33:33] night and we've shown the kids how this
[33:36] Bible was written approximately 1900 to
[33:38] 2000 years ago but there's specific and
[33:42] graphic detail about brother branham's
[33:43] life his ministry and everything like
[33:45] that in the Bible and brother Brandon
[33:48] was born April 6 1909 but there was
[33:50] already a Bible written and it fit the
[33:53] pattern of his life perfectly people in
[33:57] the Bible and even like brother Branham
[33:59] and prophets and believers sometimes do
[34:01] things so unconsciously they're not even
[34:05] aware that that's what's written and
[34:07] that's what's being fulfilled but
[34:10] friends this end-time bride has come
[34:12] into such more and more of a divine
[34:14] consciousness don't you believe that
[34:15] because you must
[34:17] so in order to overcome and rise above
[34:19] this age you must know what's written of
[34:21] you you must know it the way brother
[34:23] Branham knew it you must know it the way
[34:25] Jesus knew what was written of him you
[34:27] have to come into such a place of
[34:29] reality that when you read the Bible you
[34:32] say right there that plan a Redemption
[34:33] that's written of me
[34:34] how many believes that today all right
[34:38] so just making a point
[34:40] the last four verses of Revelation even
[34:43] though brother Branham only referred to
[34:45] it a couple times doesn't mean you're
[34:48] not supposed to deal with there doesn't
[34:50] mean I supposed to be into it and ask to
[34:51] the Lord for a light on that word
[34:53] brother Graham told us the Seventh Seal
[34:55] has three parts right and we know by
[34:58] inspiration that there's a three-fold
[35:00] mystery to the whole Bible because in
[35:03] March he preached the seven seals 1963
[35:06] but in July he preached Christ the
[35:09] mystery of God revealed and what he
[35:10] brought out of that sermon was that the
[35:12] whole Bible is one goal that God had in
[35:15] his mind but that one go had three parts
[35:18] right God in Christ Christ in you Christ
[35:23] in the bride and then the husband and
[35:25] wife take him back to a glorified Eden
[35:28] right so it's very simple the way that
[35:32] God has let the Prophet categorize the
[35:34] whole plan to us if you can just sit and
[35:36] meditate and receive that word you begin
[35:38] to see the whole Bible open up brother
[35:41] Graham said the Bible is like two great
[35:43] wings of an eagle old testament and new
[35:45] testament to take us out to give us a
[35:49] faith to fly away from this mortal world
[35:52] and he said it's like husband and wife
[35:56] though Testament is the husband the New
[35:59] Testament is the wife two halves in one
[36:02] whole husband and wife is that right you
[36:05] remember brother Graham saying that
[36:06] whenever the New Testament opens the
[36:08] Yosi husband and wife husband and wife
[36:09] husband and wife Joseph and Mary
[36:11] Zechariah and Elizabeth Anna and Simeon
[36:15] because it's a revelation coming forth
[36:18] that Lord Jesus had something sealed up
[36:20] on the inside of him is that right the
[36:23] Lord Jesus went to Calvary with a sealed
[36:25] mystery on the inside
[36:27] because when Adam was expressed in flesh
[36:30] like we were studying last night
[36:31] Adam had something sealed up in him Adam
[36:34] had a mystery sealed up in him everybody
[36:38] knows what I'm talking about now right
[36:40] Jesus had a mystery sealed up in him in
[36:44] these last days this Bible were taught
[36:46] was sealed with seven seals so the Lord
[36:49] Jesus and Adam both being spoken word
[36:53] sons of God had something within them
[36:56] that was sealed in Genesis 5:1 it says
[36:59] this is the book of the generation of
[37:01] Adam and then in Matthew chapter 1 says
[37:04] this is the book of the generation of
[37:05] Jesus Christ so the book always had a
[37:09] genealogy in it Adam's genealogy Jesus
[37:14] Christ has a spiritual gene and
[37:16] genealogy is that right so in the last
[37:19] days the Lord Jesus doesn't have to come
[37:21] back and flesh and be crucified because
[37:23] he already did that but when they tore
[37:25] his flesh open it was given birth to an
[37:28] alpha bride is that right so we know how
[37:32] the fall comes I want you to think about
[37:33] this today because this is so awesome
[37:35] whenever God opened the side of Adam
[37:38] brought forth Eve that brought a bride
[37:41] aged to Eden and in that bride age the
[37:44] serpent entered in and defiled Eve and
[37:46] defiled the whole place
[37:48] so whenever the Lord Jesus was opened up
[37:51] on Calvary opened up his side it brought
[37:53] out an alpha bride age and in the Alpha
[37:57] bride age the Antichrist spirit entered
[37:59] in with false teaching and false
[38:00] doctrine and defiled the Apostolic age
[38:03] and made it drift off into a church age
[38:05] is that right so in these last days the
[38:09] Bible talked about the Omega side of the
[38:12] equation the glory of the latter house
[38:16] will be greater than the glory of the
[38:17] former's at the prophecy but this book
[38:20] was sealed through the ages but it had
[38:22] to come a time when it becomes unsealed
[38:24] and that's why we're doing all
[38:26] revelations chapter 10 because where the
[38:28] RAM told us in plain language that's the
[38:30] seventh seal brother but you can see
[38:32] what the seventh seal is in Scripture
[38:34] because your prophet said revelations 10
[38:36] was the seventh seal and it's the coming
[38:40] of the Lord
[38:41] it's a secret coming to unite himself
[38:44] with an enzyme bride to get the place of
[38:47] preeminence and an enzyme people so he
[38:49] can change them in the atoms and catch
[38:51] them away that's the mystery of
[38:53] redemption under the Seventh Seal is it
[38:55] not brothers the coming of the Lord but
[38:58] the coming of the Lord is mystery secret
[39:01] right but we're into a certain aspect of
[39:04] this threefold mystery because we see
[39:06] the first part is a shout or a message
[39:09] of Jesus Christ himself being expressed
[39:11] his personal presence but that is to
[39:14] call a people and unite with them the
[39:19] second part of that threefold mysteries
[39:21] revelations 10 8 to 11 because the third
[39:24] part is the Trump which were the branch
[39:26] said to prophets Moses and Elijah and
[39:28] that's in Revelation chapter 11 so you
[39:31] can superimpose shout voice Trump /
[39:34] revelations 10 one to seven would be the
[39:36] shout revelations 10 8 to 11 would be
[39:39] the voice because brother Brennan said
[39:42] she's the final voice to the final age
[39:44] and Christ in her makes her the voice of
[39:47] God for the hour
[39:49] I got quotes brothers am I on the
[39:53] message that's right she's the final
[39:56] voice to the final age we read in the
[39:58] church age book the other day where the
[39:59] ground said the voice of God would be in
[40:01] her and you just read a passage where
[40:05] the angel of the Lord Jesus Christ told
[40:07] John thou must prophesy again and who
[40:11] does John represent in this passage the
[40:14] bride right you can take it what's the
[40:18] overall church of the ages that's true
[40:20] but when you look close John actually
[40:23] represents the endtime Bride because
[40:26] they tried to kill John couldn't kill
[40:28] him because he's a type of the bride
[40:30] that goes home by way of translation and
[40:32] not death is that right and John also
[40:34] heard the seven thunders so then time
[40:37] bride hears the seven thunders john was
[40:40] also showed these great things by an
[40:42] angel who was a prophet is that right so
[40:45] it's actually john represents the end
[40:48] time bride everybody see that today so
[40:52] when you understand that john represents
[40:54] the bride
[40:54] you can see by type shadow and symbolic
[40:57] language which is prophetic language
[40:59] that God uses what the program is what
[41:02] the plan of God is now we know that the
[41:05] true Bride of Christ is scattered
[41:06] through all the nations because we're
[41:08] the RAM saw her out of every nation is
[41:10] that right remember the vision that he
[41:12] had to the bride brother branch said
[41:14] that she had the banner over her breast
[41:16] and there was representing every nation
[41:19] so it's a worldwide bride you'll never
[41:23] get the bride altogether until the
[41:26] resurrection and the translation and
[41:28] that's one of the issues that we have in
[41:30] these last days but in God's wisdom we
[41:33] see brother Martin that it's perfect
[41:36] God's called a Gentile bride out of all
[41:39] the nations amen
[41:42] that was all together in the Upper Room
[41:45] but we're not all together today all of
[41:49] our brothers and sisters are scattered
[41:50] out throughout the nations but there
[41:52] ain't no distance in prayer we can be
[41:55] praying for one another amen and the
[41:58] power of the Living Christ can take this
[41:59] bride on to full maturity and change her
[42:02] and Adams and catch her away how many
[42:04] know God's gonna bring it to pass that's
[42:07] right so you see the point I'm trying to
[42:10] make here brother branham's part stopped
[42:12] at verse 7 but the bride's part picks up
[42:15] at verse 8 the Lord gave me a message
[42:17] some years ago from 7 to 8 we translate
[42:20] because the millennium is the seventh
[42:23] day then we go from the seventh day into
[42:25] the 8th is that right when you get the
[42:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's eternal
[42:30] life 7 speaks a time 8 speaks of
[42:33] eternity fro from 70 we translate we
[42:37] find this pattern all down through the
[42:39] Bible it's interesting to me that in
[42:42] Genesis chapter 37 it's the story of
[42:45] Joseph being rejected by his brethren
[42:47] sold by almost 30 pieces of silver young
[42:50] people well we went over the other day
[42:52] is that right but right in between
[42:54] Genesis 37 and 39 a Gentile woman comes
[42:57] in to receive seed why is the woman's
[43:00] part associated with eight huh even in
[43:07] the Millennium when John Luke
[43:08] he sees a bride coming down out of
[43:10] heaven as a as a bride adorned for her
[43:12] husband it's the new heavens and new
[43:14] earth coming after the Millennium
[43:16] so in Revelations 10-7 is the prophets
[43:19] part than 10-8 is the bride's part
[43:22] because God has placed us in a pattern
[43:25] we're moving from time into eternity and
[43:28] it's been foreshadowed that way in the
[43:30] Bible there's a reason why the Song of
[43:33] Solomon has eight chapters because the
[43:36] Song of Solomon is Christ in the bride
[43:38] going back and forth crashing the bride
[43:40] in there's eight chapters is that right
[43:42] I want to share something with you just
[43:45] today was just simply about Christ and
[43:48] bride form because we all recognize
[43:51] vindication with the Prophet Christ was
[43:54] veiled behind a prophet to bring forth
[43:57] the mysteries of the Bible tie up all
[43:59] the loose ends and it would be the
[44:01] revealing of the Son of man that
[44:03] actually calls out a bride we can't do
[44:07] away with that part it is extremely
[44:08] important but let's go on to know the
[44:12] present tense reality of what Christ is
[44:14] doing in a redeemed people Amen I don't
[44:19] believe the bride needs to be told God
[44:22] sent a prophet press play
[44:23] stay with the message I stay with the
[44:26] message every day the Lord Jesus comes
[44:29] to me and anoints me to understand what
[44:31] brother Branham saying I'm not trying to
[44:34] figure anything out I'm letting the Holy
[44:36] Ghost inspire to me what about you huh I
[44:40] try to tell young people how important
[44:42] it is to meditate in the word it ain't
[44:44] about starting a message just so you can
[44:47] finish it that's not what the sermons of
[44:49] the Prophet or for those sermons are so
[44:52] impregnated with certain truths you got
[44:54] to unpack those things you got to let
[44:56] the Holy Spirit inspire those things to
[44:58] you because there's people that's read
[45:00] the sermons for years go over things and
[45:03] miss stuff I'll be honest if you know
[45:06] boning me I'll admit I've been reading
[45:08] the message for years and years and
[45:09] sometimes the Holy Spirit really has to
[45:11] arrest my attention set me down and I
[45:14] find things in that spoken word message
[45:16] that I really miss
[45:17] prior I got an example here today that I
[45:21] shared that brother Sammy integers
[45:23] church one day and I was telling brother
[45:25] Dale in the office the Lord really got a
[45:27] hold of me one morning whenever I went
[45:29] to work I just picked the bestest book
[45:31] out of a bookshelf went to work and the
[45:33] boss told me Matthew you got two trucks
[45:36] today I want you to sit here and wait
[45:37] for them true trucks and when they get
[45:39] here unload them I said okay so I set an
[45:43] office and waited for the trucks to show
[45:44] up but I was reading my new ministry I
[45:47] was meditating in this sermon and I was
[45:50] taking my time because I had all day and
[45:52] the Holy Spirit was so sweet to me not
[45:55] come in just right there and the Holy
[45:57] Spirit would make sure I would was
[45:58] paying attention and the Lord ministered
[46:00] something to me out of the sermon that
[46:02] changed my life
[46:03] frankly it changed my ministry it's so
[46:07] powerful and it was done in such
[46:08] simplicity and just meditation in the
[46:12] word it was so wonderful it's communion
[46:16] with Christ
[46:17] I didn't say hey I listened to a message
[46:19] today it's more like the Lord Jesus came
[46:23] to me and shared something with me from
[46:26] the prophets message that opened up the
[46:28] whole Bible that's what the message is
[46:31] for I noticed for the first time because
[46:34] I always thought just in passing that
[46:37] there were six squirrels spoken into
[46:38] existence and I got once I seen what I
[46:41] seen I got on the phone I started
[46:43] calling preachers hey how many preach
[46:45] how many squirrels are spoken existence
[46:46] some folks said three some brother said
[46:49] four I said brother there was seven
[46:51] squirrels three in Salem Alabama in
[46:55] Salem Alabama Salem Indiana and four in
[46:58] Campbellsville Kentucky but the Lord
[47:01] showed me there's a pattern because
[47:02] brother Brahim said it was the Lord
[47:04] confirming my commission those seven
[47:07] squirrels represent the seven spoken
[47:09] word mysteries of the seven thunders
[47:11] because the same voice that spoke
[47:13] squirrels into existence is the same
[47:16] voice that unfolded the mystery
[47:18] underneath the seven seals and the seven
[47:21] thunders are the revelations contained
[47:23] in the seven seals so brother Barnett
[47:26] Branham was anointed with Christ to
[47:28] speak squirrels into existence
[47:31] he was anointed of Christ to speak what
[47:33] with the hidden mystery was in the Bible
[47:35] but whenever I was reading this brother
[47:38] sisters I noticed that there was a
[47:39] pattern to it that resembled how he
[47:41] ministered the seals because in between
[47:44] the six squirrel and the seven squirrel
[47:46] Tony's able put a question mark to
[47:48] Brother Browns testimony and those
[47:50] questions and answers inserted in
[47:52] between the sixth seal the seventh seal
[47:54] and then when brother Branham goes back
[47:56] to find that seventh and final squirrel
[47:58] he looks all over the place and he can't
[48:00] find it because it's at seventh mystery
[48:03] you got to dig a little bit deeper to
[48:05] find the first six seals are easy those
[48:08] are spoken clearly brother Brennan who
[48:10] publicly told us what they symbolize
[48:12] what they mean how they're placed out
[48:14] and the herd of deer ministers say that
[48:16] it none of the six seals cause
[48:18] contention among believers because you
[48:22] got a point blank it's the seventh seal
[48:24] that causes division the seventh seal
[48:27] remembers the coming of the Lord but
[48:30] watch how it symbolized there how God
[48:32] was patterning it through the Prophet
[48:34] while you're hunting squirrels he goes
[48:36] to look for that seventh squirrel and
[48:38] then the Lord spoke to him and said now
[48:40] say it'll be there and it'll be there
[48:42] because he looked all over
[48:43] he knew he shot at seven but he only
[48:45] recovered six and he went back the next
[48:48] day to look for the seventh one and
[48:49] brethren says that the Lord told him
[48:52] says go pick up that piece of bark right
[48:55] you remember that let's go go pick up
[48:58] that piece of bark and then he said he
[49:01] moved that piece of bark out of the way
[49:03] there wasn't that in there all right
[49:06] remember what the bark represented in
[49:08] restoration of the bride tree Brent said
[49:10] the bark was the doctrine of holiness
[49:13] Wesley's church age and then he said he
[49:16] looked down and wasn't nothing there and
[49:18] then he was standing there an amazement
[49:20] looked down again he's seen a piece of
[49:21] grey hair sticking out from underneath
[49:23] the leaf he reached down and there was
[49:25] that seven squirrel but I want you to
[49:28] notice it was under the bark and under a
[49:30] leaf under the bark that's the Wesleyan
[49:33] Church age the doctrine of holiness
[49:34] under the leaf represents the
[49:36] Pentecostals where the branch said
[49:38] clapping rejoicing so under Wesley's
[49:40] aged under Pentecostal age didn't you
[49:42] get the meat
[49:43] the word because Reverend said his
[49:46] favorite me was squirrel meat amen that
[49:49] seven squirrel was hid deeper than the
[49:52] other squirrels were and there's a great
[49:55] pattern to this brunch sisters because
[49:57] brother Branham says here and these
[49:58] quotes immediately after the seven
[50:02] squirrels the first time that third Pole
[50:04] operated on a human being was Hattie
[50:06] right so brother Branham is a seventh
[50:09] church age messenger he's featured in
[50:12] revelations ten seven right after
[50:14] brother Browns ministry is a bride being
[50:16] brought out and being brought to
[50:18] maturity under the headship of Christ
[50:20] and being brought into speaking
[50:22] conditions so right after the seven
[50:25] scores are spoken Hattie writers told
[50:27] whatever you say Hattie God's telling me
[50:31] right now to tell you whatever you say
[50:33] so it's a pattern brother Branham says
[50:36] immediately after the seven squirrels
[50:39] the first time it was done he says here
[50:42] in my new ministry I looked a sister
[50:44] Hattie the first time it was ever
[50:46] performed on a human being I said sister
[50:48] Hattie ask what you will and God is
[50:50] going to give it to you so get the idea
[50:54] it's very simple God anoints brother
[50:57] Branham why son squirrels
[50:59] brother branham is meditating in mark 11
[51:02] Lord is that in the atonement an angel
[51:06] of the Lord said that's part of the
[51:07] atonement and in the Lord was dealing
[51:10] brother Branham who is that that speaks
[51:12] about the people on the platform is that
[51:14] you they says Oh Lord forgive me that's
[51:17] been you the whole time
[51:18] it's it's Christ in the profit and it's
[51:22] Christ in the bride
[51:25] it's all about the Lord Jesus amen
[51:30] like that poem in the church age book
[51:32] once it was the blessing now it is the
[51:34] Lord once it was the feeling now it is
[51:37] his word once his gift I wanted now the
[51:40] give her own once I sought for Hill and
[51:42] now himself alone all in all forever
[51:46] Jesus will I sing everything in Jesus
[51:48] and Jesus everything not the prophet of
[51:52] Jesus not preachers in Jesus not the
[51:55] church in Jesus just Jesus just give me
[51:58] Jesus come on is that the way you
[52:00] believe it's a day without him what do
[52:03] you have nothing what's brother Brandon
[52:06] without Jesus what's the bride without
[52:08] Jesus what's the message churches
[52:10] without Jesus huh so alien about him I
[52:15] think that should be our focus I
[52:19] appreciate the way God has blessed my
[52:21] life through ministers but I don't
[52:22] worship ministers I don't wash your
[52:25] prophets and whenever I go to heaven I
[52:28] don't want to go to be the first one to
[52:30] shake brother Browns hand I want to be
[52:31] like brother Branham when he went over
[52:32] there he said where's Jesus where's the
[52:35] one that died for me where's the one
[52:37] that purchased my soul is that right
[52:40] the Lord Jesus is who I see when I read
[52:44] the Bible amen
[52:46] and what you want is the Holy Spirit to
[52:49] anoint you with such a faith that you
[52:50] see yourself in him and you see him in
[52:53] you is that right so how many
[52:55] understands what I'm what I'm kind of
[52:57] laying out here after the prophets part
[53:00] there's a bride and God for shadowed
[53:02] this right in the story or in the
[53:04] experience of hunting squirrels after
[53:06] the seventh squirrel a woman is told to
[53:09] speak paddy had to say her part paddy
[53:13] has H and her first name in the H and
[53:16] her last name the letter H is featured
[53:19] in a lot of these women in the Bible
[53:20] that are typing the bride Ruth Rahab
[53:24] Rebecca right many of them and the
[53:30] letter H is the eighth letter in the
[53:32] alphabet right so we go from seven to
[53:36] eight we go from time to each
[53:38] see so you go from the seventh church
[53:41] age messenger to a bride and she's the
[53:44] final voice to the final age under her
[53:46] messenger but brother Brown said the
[53:48] voice that God will be in her and
[53:50] revelations 22 verse 17 the spirit and
[53:53] the bride say come the bride saying with
[53:57] the spirit saying is that right so it's
[54:01] really a fantastic reality amen I don't
[54:04] know that I've read many quotes here
[54:06] brothers but I think you are familiar
[54:08] enough with the message to know brother
[54:10] Brent says now it's begin to form in
[54:11] Bride form the Christ in the form of his
[54:15] bride
[54:16] that's the revelation of the hour Christ
[54:18] was veiled in a prophet now through the
[54:21] spoken word ministry and the power of
[54:23] the Holy Spirit that has called and
[54:25] separated a bride Christ has gained the
[54:28] place of preeminence and somebody
[54:30] somebody's got their mind renewed
[54:32] somebody's under preeminence to the word
[54:36] and that's an endtime bride is God gonna
[54:39] anoint this bride to overcome this age
[54:42] what is the overcoming factor in the
[54:44] bride its Christ himself
[54:46] remember pick up your pen and write the
[54:50] Holy Spirit said the word is in the
[54:53] bride as it wasn't Mary is that right
[54:56] and now that's in the church age book
[55:00] but in spoken words or in the original
[55:01] CD says the word is in the bride and the
[55:04] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[55:07] done with the word she has the word
[55:10] rightly divided to her because she's
[55:13] been divided from the church is that
[55:16] right the red description in Luke 12
[55:18] because in our second service today the
[55:20] Lord will and I was going to get into at
[55:21] that chapter Luke 12 and talk about the
[55:24] separated bride because this is Christ
[55:26] and bride form today amen so you have
[55:31] something going on right now in this age
[55:35] that's been foreshadowed in the Bible
[55:38] the false church system was foreshadowed
[55:41] in the Bible government uniting what
[55:44] that church is for shout in the Bible
[55:46] Elijah come to prophesy its doom
[55:49] foreshadowed in the Bible a bride being
[55:52] called out and being brought into spoken
[55:54] word conditions that's foreshadowed down
[55:57] through scripture amen I wanted you to
[56:02] write this down and do this sometime go
[56:04] to the Book of Proverbs read the first
[56:06] seven chapters you don't have to do it
[56:07] right now but just make a note of it
[56:09] Solomon is speaking in 7 straight
[56:12] chapters and in the eighth chapter it's
[56:14] a woman starting to speak
[56:16] that woman's wisdom because jesus said
[56:19] that wisdom is justified of her children
[56:22] I asked the Lord one time says why does
[56:25] the Bible refer to wisdom as a woman as
[56:28] a she and then Lord direct me to a
[56:30] quotation of the Prophet in the church
[56:32] age book I believe I got my answer and
[56:34] like the reader for you remember there's
[56:36] eight chapters in the book of the Song
[56:38] of Solomon and I'm trying to share you a
[56:40] pattern that is totally scriptural amen
[56:43] and I believe it's important to
[56:45] understand because it's relating to you
[56:47] the bride the called out bride you must
[56:50] be conscience of what is written of you
[56:53] in this Bible because that's how brother
[56:55] Branham overcame that's how Jesus
[56:57] overcame and that's how the same time
[56:58] bride's gonna overcome you have to see
[57:01] the pattern you have to see how God
[57:02] placed it here because you got a walk
[57:04] conscience and swauk in that reality is
[57:08] that right sin doesn't overtake you you
[57:11] overcome it death is not to overtake you
[57:14] in these last days here to overtake it
[57:16] that's the reality so Christ has to be
[57:20] in your vessel re leaven in the lump
[57:25] that you are leavened with and sin right
[57:28] to re leaven you with eternal life and
[57:31] then you rise above the more Towe mortal
[57:34] condition and evil overcome death that's
[57:36] the Lord Jesus himself doing that into
[57:38] people that's very very serious don't
[57:42] you think friends that is a reality to
[57:46] people in the earth today we don't know
[57:49] who they all are but Christ sure does if
[57:52] anything see it as it's been given to us
[57:55] through the word to know that's the
[57:57] reality I keep telling the young people
[57:59] don't let the news media don't let you
[58:03] know people and things and this
[58:05] age and the media dictate the reality of
[58:08] this age to you because it's not
[58:11] accurate they feed you what they want
[58:14] you to think but it's the Bible a
[58:16] thinking man's filter that actually
[58:18] interprets the reality of the age that
[58:20] you live in you're at the end of a
[58:23] Gentile dispensation God's getting ready
[58:25] to turn from the Gentiles and go call
[58:27] little Benjamin that's the reality but
[58:30] before he does that he gets an endtime
[58:32] people ready and prepared brother Graham
[58:37] said in endtime evangelism that endtime
[58:41] evangelism is to get the bride ready and
[58:43] prepared for the rapture is that right
[58:45] so there really nothing else to be
[58:48] involved with we have church but what is
[58:51] church for its edify your walk with the
[58:53] Lord it's to help you get closer to
[58:55] Christ amen go with me to first Kings
[59:00] book of first kings I'm gonna read this
[59:03] quote to you about this woman brother
[59:05] Brandon refers to the bride and then I'm
[59:08] gonna share with you a pattern of
[59:10] something that the Lord Jesus let me
[59:12] notice and that is really floated my
[59:14] boat really good and I've been rejoicing
[59:17] in this for the whole year now I got it
[59:23] right here but I wanted to find it over
[59:25] here first Kings chapter 6 is where
[59:29] we're going to start we're gonna wind up
[59:30] in chapter 8 and that's another thing of
[59:32] all places first Kings chapter 8 is
[59:35] speaking of the temple that Solomon
[59:37] build amen
[59:38] you think that's a coincidence oh
[59:40] there's God portraying something here
[59:43] all right I want you to also notice in
[59:46] first Kings chapter 8 there's 66 verses
[59:48] and the 66 the verse which is the final
[59:51] verse of chapter 8 it says King Solomon
[59:54] sent the people happy and rejoicing to
[59:56] their tents hmm to their tents so King
[1:00:01] Jesus get ready dismiss his bride to
[1:00:03] their new bodies amen
[1:00:05] everything's been prefigured and
[1:00:07] foreshadowed in the scripture you just
[1:00:09] need the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:00:11] right okay that's what that's where I
[1:00:13] wanted to go okay so in first Kings
[1:00:16] chapter 6 you're going to read about
[1:00:19] Soloman finishing and completing the
[1:00:20] temple but look at its 37 okay and 38
[1:00:25] and 37 says in the fourth year was the
[1:00:29] foundation of the house of the Lord laid
[1:00:31] in the month zip okay and in this
[1:00:34] eleventh year so from the fourth year of
[1:00:36] Solomon's reign to the eleventh year
[1:00:38] seven years the Bible tells you that the
[1:00:40] temple was built in seven years that's
[1:00:42] like the seven churches right okay but I
[1:00:45] want you to notice what he says in verse
[1:00:47] 38 and in the eleventh year in the month
[1:00:50] bull which is the eighth the eighth
[1:00:53] month of the year the eleventh year of
[1:00:55] the reign you have a 8:11 like the last
[1:00:59] four verses of Revelations 10 8 to 11
[1:01:01] because that is the temple of the Lord
[1:01:04] the bride is the temple now if you
[1:01:06] remember how program taught us the
[1:01:08] Temple of Solomon represents the body of
[1:01:10] Christ because the material that went
[1:01:13] into build Solomon's Temple was gathered
[1:01:16] from all over the world
[1:01:17] the stones that were they made and hone
[1:01:20] them stones there were some African
[1:01:22] stones huh there were some Indian stones
[1:01:25] there was there was some some Russian
[1:01:29] stones there I some Spanish and Latino
[1:01:33] stones is that right there was God from
[1:01:36] all over the world and that formed the
[1:01:38] temple is that right but the temple
[1:01:42] right here showing you that it was
[1:01:44] completed in the eighth month of the
[1:01:46] year and the 11th year Solomon's ring
[1:01:49] okay now when you go to chapter 8 you go
[1:01:54] to chapter 8 this whole thing on folks
[1:01:56] from verse 1 to verse 11 when the temple
[1:01:59] is being dedicated they bring the Ark of
[1:02:01] the Covenant into the temple right and
[1:02:04] it's in the seventh month that this is
[1:02:07] done and it's during the Feast of
[1:02:09] Tabernacles brother Branham said in
[1:02:12] future home that wonderful sermon that
[1:02:14] were worshiping now under the Feast of
[1:02:17] Tabernacles because Christ is entering
[1:02:20] into the tabernacle his bride and when
[1:02:23] you read revelations 10 8 to 11 what do
[1:02:25] you see the
[1:02:26] the word Christ entering into John so
[1:02:31] the words taken flesh and and endtime
[1:02:33] people the word goes from a one-man
[1:02:36] ministry until multiplied bride I don't
[1:02:39] understand why that's so hard for people
[1:02:41] jesus said except the corn of wheat dies
[1:02:44] it abides alone but if it dies it brings
[1:02:48] forth much fruit so Lord Jesus was the
[1:02:51] one man ministry he went into the grave
[1:02:53] and when he came out he came out
[1:02:55] multiplied they made all that anointed
[1:02:59] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:03:00] the church and it was veiled behind the
[1:03:03] prophet but after the spoken word
[1:03:05] ministry why do you think his message
[1:03:08] against translated in all the other
[1:03:09] languages because Christ is multiplying
[1:03:12] his life through spoken word that's
[1:03:16] right that's how God multiplies his life
[1:03:19] is through spoken word Christ has
[1:03:21] multiplied his life in these last days
[1:03:23] to spoken word that's right
[1:03:25] and it's through the ministering and
[1:03:28] teaching of that that people become more
[1:03:29] and more conscience of these things
[1:03:31] right here this whole plans been laid
[1:03:34] out in the Bible do you think it's just
[1:03:36] a coincidence that they finished the
[1:03:38] temple and the eleventh year of his
[1:03:39] reign in the eighth month of the year
[1:03:41] read with me in first Kings chapter 8 it
[1:03:46] says in verse 2 and all the men of
[1:03:50] Israel assembled themselves together
[1:03:52] write unto King Solomon in the feast of
[1:03:57] the month F&M which is the seventh month
[1:04:00] right
[1:04:01] seventh church age somebody called us
[1:04:05] together right and all the elders of
[1:04:08] Israel came and the priests took up the
[1:04:10] ark right what was they gonna put the
[1:04:13] ark in the temple what is the Ark
[1:04:17] represent Jesus Christ brother branham
[1:04:19] taught us it was a box of wood overlaid
[1:04:22] with gold
[1:04:22] the wood represents your humanity flesh
[1:04:25] gold represents did see God from heaven
[1:04:27] so is a box of wood a man representing
[1:04:31] gold representing God such Jesus Christ
[1:04:35] as a god man so they bring the ark and
[1:04:38] they
[1:04:39] bring it into the temple which
[1:04:40] represents the bride and it has 8:11
[1:04:44] connection like it's showing you in
[1:04:45] revelations 10 8 to 11 the word in it in
[1:04:48] the John this is the reality whether
[1:04:53] people want to admit it or not Christ
[1:04:54] was once veiled in a prophet now he's
[1:04:57] veiled and a multiply bride and in that
[1:05:00] bride body is a fivefold ministry to
[1:05:03] strengthen that body to nourish that
[1:05:05] body to minister to that body is that
[1:05:08] right
[1:05:09] that's hilarious when tape only people
[1:05:12] call me on the phone say brother Brent
[1:05:14] kid or brother Matthew can you tell me
[1:05:15] where brother Brent said this and
[1:05:17] explain this to me go listen to the tape
[1:05:21] if you're if you don't want no minister
[1:05:22] to help you I get the phone calls from
[1:05:26] tape only people brother Brando's my
[1:05:28] pastor and why you calling me that's
[1:05:31] right this friction of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:37] is what's needed
[1:05:38] it's the anointing of the Lord that's
[1:05:40] what's needed it we don't get nowhere
[1:05:42] it's the Holy Spirit I'm gonna read
[1:05:46] something for you out of the uncertain
[1:05:49] sound brother Brown was in the tavern
[1:05:51] and he tells the people I believe you
[1:05:53] wouldn't come to church hot today where
[1:05:56] we have to sit here and suffer under the
[1:05:58] heat just to be coming to church for the
[1:06:00] fun of coming
[1:06:01] I'm sorry brothers I didn't have this in
[1:06:03] my notes it's uncertain sound 55 July
[1:06:06] 31st paragraph 51 okay just to be coming
[1:06:11] to church for the fun of coming I
[1:06:13] believe there's a certain thing that you
[1:06:15] come for that is Christ amen did you
[1:06:19] come to feed on Christ today brother
[1:06:22] Brown says in verse 52 paragraph 52 and
[1:06:26] on certain sound
[1:06:27] 19:55 you never come to hear me although
[1:06:31] I may do the best I can but I can never
[1:06:34] draw anybody to God no one can draw it
[1:06:40] but Christ
[1:06:42] you come to hear the sing and perhaps
[1:06:44] the singing is very fine
[1:06:46] we like that kind of singing but singing
[1:06:48] doesn't draw people to Christ
[1:06:50] sing and don't draw people to Christ we
[1:06:54] got some good singers that I'm sorry
[1:06:56] ain't nothing against you singer folks
[1:06:58] but singing don't do it now check this
[1:07:02] out it's the Holy Spirit that draws
[1:07:05] people to Christ all right
[1:07:09] paragraph 54 preaching doesn't draw
[1:07:13] although we try the best we can pastor
[1:07:16] and I we do the very best to draw people
[1:07:18] to Christ or preach the gospel but it is
[1:07:21] the Holy Spirit who has to draw your
[1:07:23] heart and give you that certain sound we
[1:07:27] can preach the gospel what we think is
[1:07:29] right but it the Holy Spirit has to give
[1:07:32] the sound that echoes in your heart and
[1:07:35] there is a certain sound amen have you
[1:07:39] heard the sound of his voice today
[1:07:41] speaking in the innermost being of your
[1:07:43] soul is that right
[1:07:46] praise God for His grace is that right
[1:07:48] now watch how this connects up in the
[1:07:50] scripture because this is fantastic you
[1:07:53] have them dedicated in the temple in the
[1:07:56] seventh month first Kings chapter 8 but
[1:08:00] the temple was finished in the eighth
[1:08:01] month so when they finished the temple
[1:08:04] in the eighth month it was 11 months
[1:08:05] later when they dedicated it 8:11
[1:08:10] because Christ is being portrayed here
[1:08:13] as inhabiting his bride the temple that
[1:08:17] Solomon built represents you it was
[1:08:19] finished in the seventh month and when
[1:08:22] you examine the whole chapter its verse
[1:08:24] 1 to 11 that the Ark is brought in then
[1:08:28] in verse 11 God fills the temple read
[1:08:31] verse 11 so that the priest could not
[1:08:34] stand a minister because of the cloud
[1:08:37] for the glory of the Lord had filled the
[1:08:40] house of the Lord and in verse 12
[1:08:43] Solomon starts his prayer but it's
[1:08:45] chapter 8 1 to 11
[1:08:47] see that's the second part of the
[1:08:49] mystery Christ and bride form
[1:08:52] he brought a message so vindicated
[1:08:54] prophet
[1:08:55] don't we love it but there's a reality
[1:08:57] and a maturing and a growth the bride's
[1:09:01] not afraid to read past verse seven the
[1:09:05] bride's not afraid to see herself in
[1:09:07] this word because they want you to stop
[1:09:10] at the prophet they want you to stop at
[1:09:12] Abraham sending their legs our Abraham
[1:09:14] sent LA's our Abraham sent la's our
[1:09:17] isn't there more to it than that
[1:09:19] a laser was sent to call out a bride
[1:09:22] from Babylon is that right but does the
[1:09:26] story stop there
[1:09:27] no I don't think so Rebekah went all the
[1:09:29] way to Isaac's tent is that right and
[1:09:33] they got together in a marriage union is
[1:09:35] that right so the object today is Christ
[1:09:37] in the union with his bride that's the
[1:09:41] Bible that's the scripture that's what
[1:09:44] the emphasis should be your soul and God
[1:09:47] so as one so he's teaching last night
[1:09:50] right
[1:09:51] first Corinthians 6 verse 17 but he that
[1:09:54] is joined unto the Lord is one spirit
[1:09:57] oneness with Christ huh is that right
[1:10:04] now let me read for you this statement
[1:10:07] of the Prophet where he says that the
[1:10:11] temple was made of material from around
[1:10:16] the world if I can get my act together
[1:10:19] here it's a quotation that I thought I
[1:10:22] had in my notes
[1:10:23] maybe brother Joe can find it for me and
[1:10:25] put it up praise the Lord you get your
[1:10:28] mind going in a certain way amen
[1:10:32] it is the statement I know you are
[1:10:36] familiar with the right brother Graham
[1:10:37] says that the temple was made from
[1:10:38] material around the world right they
[1:10:42] brought all those things together to
[1:10:44] build a dwelling place for the ark the
[1:10:46] message has went through all the nations
[1:10:48] to call a bride to Christ the meeting
[1:10:51] place is not in a particular City it's
[1:10:54] not in a particular Church it's not
[1:10:56] under a particular Ministry of a one-man
[1:10:59] ministry it is in Christ God only has
[1:11:02] one place to meet you that's in Christ
[1:11:05] is it now what the profit stood for
[1:11:06] don't worship God in any Oh gate but the
[1:11:09] gate that I place my name and the name
[1:11:12] of God is placed in the word interpreted
[1:11:14] for the outer if you live in God's name
[1:11:17] was once represented by the Lutheran's
[1:11:19] because there was the voice of God for
[1:11:21] their day but they stopped speaking for
[1:11:24] God when they couldn't move on with the
[1:11:25] word is that right
[1:11:28] and people think today that they're
[1:11:29] speaking for God because they believe
[1:11:31] God sent a prophet
[1:11:32] the Pharisees believe God sent Moses all
[1:11:35] kind of people believe God sent a
[1:11:37] prophet in different ages and everything
[1:11:38] like that don't you think the devil
[1:11:41] believes God sent a prophet that prophet
[1:11:44] was anointed with the spear and power of
[1:11:46] Elijah the holy spirit and fullness of
[1:11:48] Christ and the devil God kits nine ways
[1:11:50] to Sunday that devil knows God sent a
[1:11:53] prophet and people in this age can know
[1:11:56] God sent a prophet and really don't do
[1:11:58] much for him hmm
[1:12:00] that's true all kind of people no God
[1:12:04] sent Moses cuz we got the Ten
[1:12:05] Commandments all right we got the Ten
[1:12:09] Commandments God sent Moses but the
[1:12:12] difference is you live by that word is
[1:12:14] that word expressing itself through you
[1:12:16] or have you become a written epistle
[1:12:18] read known of all men of the prophets
[1:12:20] message because we're taught that
[1:12:22] there's three Bibles the first bat was
[1:12:25] in the stars
[1:12:26] the second Bible was Enochs pyramid
[1:12:28] wrote in stone the third Bible is this
[1:12:30] right here sixty-six books of the Bible
[1:12:33] wrote by 40 different authors is God's
[1:12:35] thought expressed on page for you and I
[1:12:37] is that right but but the word don't
[1:12:41] stop there the final resting place of
[1:12:44] the word is always in flesh wasn't Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ the Living Word
[1:12:48] he's the Bible as the endtime bride to
[1:12:51] the Living Word he's the by it she's the
[1:12:53] Bible is that right this word is
[1:12:56] supposed to take spirit and life in
[1:12:58] flesh that's the revelation oh I want to
[1:13:02] say something real true spiritual
[1:13:07] revelation is you becoming conscience of
[1:13:12] the Word made flesh in the hour that you
[1:13:16] live in
[1:13:17] that's what real revelation is
[1:13:20] revelation is recognizing the word in
[1:13:22] flesh now the Holy Spirit anoints you to
[1:13:25] see things in the Bible I never saw this
[1:13:27] before this year how the 811 from
[1:13:30] revelations 10 8 to 11 is connected up
[1:13:32] then Solomon's Temple in different
[1:13:34] places of the word because the idea I
[1:13:36] hope you understand what I'm trying to
[1:13:38] preach the idea is Christ in the form of
[1:13:41] his bride and I've been seeing how
[1:13:44] that's been foreshadowed down through
[1:13:45] the Bible how after seven scores of
[1:13:48] spoke than a woman Hattie right
[1:13:50] it's a pattern after the seven churches
[1:13:52] messenger a bride age after the
[1:13:56] seven-day millennium the new heavens and
[1:13:58] the new earth
[1:13:58] you've been set to a pattern to walk in
[1:14:01] such a way and so conscience in God's
[1:14:03] power and God's economy he's fulfilling
[1:14:06] now what he's going to fulfill again in
[1:14:08] the future
[1:14:09] this is what faith is it's the mind of
[1:14:12] God thinking it starts through you and
[1:14:15] you're walking out the word in your day
[1:14:17] Christ is living his life out through
[1:14:19] you because the words reflecting through
[1:14:21] you does that make sense
[1:14:24] so do you see how in these last days
[1:14:27] Satan has gathered all of his powers
[1:14:30] through organization he mixes the false
[1:14:32] religion with the ikanai with the
[1:14:34] politics and war-making capability with
[1:14:37] the black horse which is economy he
[1:14:39] mixes all those three things together in
[1:14:41] a pale horse this endtime bride
[1:14:43] overcomes all of that this InTown Brides
[1:14:46] anointed overcome all those powers of
[1:14:48] the devil but false teaching and that
[1:14:52] white horse is still with us today Satan
[1:14:54] still rides the ride white horse because
[1:14:57] we're in said the white horse was the
[1:14:59] antichrist going forth in a teaching
[1:15:01] ministry then he Christ as a teacher
[1:15:05] because he's counterfeiting the Holy
[1:15:07] Spirit who is the inside teacher so the
[1:15:11] only way to combat the Antichrist
[1:15:12] teaching us have a real revelation of
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ and His Word and preach it
[1:15:16] true ministers need to be preaching more
[1:15:19] than ever
[1:15:20] you know what Satan's job is to always
[1:15:23] crop everything up around the true thing
[1:15:25] you go into a Christian bookstore they
[1:15:27] put a little bitty shelf for King James
[1:15:29] Version like
[1:15:29] then all the other perverted versions
[1:15:32] are all around that bookshelf after
[1:15:33] bookshelf he counterfeits the true then
[1:15:36] he multiplies it to drowned out the
[1:15:39] voice of the true bride
[1:15:41] you got more scallywags and more
[1:15:44] double-minded carnal minded people in
[1:15:46] the message today than ever but that
[1:15:48] don't mean there ain't a true bride
[1:15:49] somewhere in the midst of all that
[1:15:53] that's right people get so discouraged
[1:15:56] be like I don't know and then they just
[1:15:58] leave the message just because there's
[1:16:00] so much confusion and carnality and the
[1:16:03] churches don't mean there's not a real
[1:16:04] new birth they don't mean there's not a
[1:16:07] real Holy Ghost power that can take all
[1:16:11] kinds of things of the world from you
[1:16:12] amen don't be discouraged hold on to the
[1:16:15] promise see it in the work take the
[1:16:17] prophets message back to the Bible
[1:16:19] because it makes the Bible alive there's
[1:16:22] a quickening power that moves off of
[1:16:24] that into your life that enables you
[1:16:26] comforts you empowers you and gives you
[1:16:30] the mind of Christ you don't want to
[1:16:32] approach life no other way but with the
[1:16:34] mind of Christ trust me
[1:16:36] everything else is torment the
[1:16:38] uncertainty and not knowing torment so
[1:16:41] many people but the revelation of the
[1:16:43] word brings absolute faith it brings the
[1:16:47] absolute into our hearts day men so I
[1:16:51] just wanted to share some scriptures
[1:16:53] with you today that is really fantastic
[1:16:55] because the this chapter 10 8 to 11 if
[1:17:01] it is a prophetic truth in a revelation
[1:17:04] brother Branham taught us all scripture
[1:17:07] answers to Scripture and I'd love to
[1:17:10] point things out to people to show look
[1:17:13] how scriptural brother Rams thinking was
[1:17:15] brother Branham thought always in terms
[1:17:18] of Scripture and that's the way message
[1:17:21] people should be you can't hardly get
[1:17:23] message folks to read their Bible you
[1:17:26] should absolutely be in your Bible all
[1:17:28] the time the Prophet was is that right
[1:17:32] those gifts that operate in brother
[1:17:35] Browns life was to vindicate he had the
[1:17:37] authority from Christ to interpret
[1:17:39] scripture the interpretation of
[1:17:41] Scripture has done
[1:17:42] by Christ living it through you you
[1:17:45] become the interpretation of the Bible
[1:17:47] when the life of Christ takes hold in
[1:17:48] you and you begin to walk into divine
[1:17:50] consciousness amen
[1:17:53] so remember how we are saying that the
[1:17:57] temple is made up of material from
[1:18:00] around the world is that right
[1:18:02] and we know how that is reality in this
[1:18:11] story of Israel's history and I still
[1:18:15] can't find maybe that's what listen when
[1:18:19] they built the Temple of Solomon any of
[1:18:21] you Mason's here now could get this
[1:18:23] pretty good they brought the Cedars down
[1:18:25] from Lebanon they floated them in as far
[1:18:27] as Joppa and hauled them by ox cart and
[1:18:29] so forth you know then they cut out all
[1:18:33] their stones all around the world right
[1:18:36] stone upon stone didn't about didn't
[1:18:39] Bible say that your lively stones built
[1:18:41] up a spiritual house a holy habitation
[1:18:44] right now bring up the scripture Matthew
[1:18:47] 8:11 put up Matthew 8:11 for us check
[1:18:51] this out Matthew 8:11 says and I say
[1:18:59] unto you that many shall come from the
[1:19:01] east and west and shall sit down with
[1:19:04] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[1:19:06] kingdom of heaven come from all load of
[1:19:09] place 8:11 right and Genesis chapter 8
[1:19:13] verse 11 it says then the Dove came into
[1:19:15] him in the evening time the language
[1:19:19] says that the languages not the Dove
[1:19:21] came on to him when you're reading about
[1:19:24] says the Dove came in to him in the
[1:19:27] evening time and lo her mouth was and in
[1:19:30] her mouth was an olive leaf sluggish she
[1:19:32] had a message in her mouth huh she had a
[1:19:35] message of peace Shalom in her mouth is
[1:19:39] that right and I've leaf tucked off so
[1:19:41] no one knew that the waters were abated
[1:19:43] from off the earth is that right
[1:19:44] but 8:11 the dove flew into him is there
[1:19:48] I so the ark is brought into Solomon's
[1:19:52] Temple in first Kings chapter 8 verse 1
[1:19:54] to 11 Sara
[1:19:55] John is eating the book which is
[1:19:58] actually Christ the word in and into
[1:20:01] John in Revelations 10 8 to 11 is that
[1:20:04] right
[1:20:05] so go to Romans chapter 8 verse 11
[1:20:11] Romans 8:11 you are to probably ought to
[1:20:14] quote that but if the spirit of him that
[1:20:17] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:20:20] you it's all about Christ living in his
[1:20:22] bride Christ living in his people the
[1:20:26] Word made flesh seeing the prophets part
[1:20:29] is only just part of the program there's
[1:20:34] another part beyond that it's the
[1:20:37] bride's part because after Jesus was
[1:20:39] crucified his life was multiplied after
[1:20:43] God fills himself behind a prophet to
[1:20:45] reveal the Son of Man that is to be
[1:20:48] multiplied into people without that you
[1:20:51] don't have translating grapes or
[1:20:52] answering faith if Christ doesn't take
[1:20:54] if his word doesn't become flesh in you
[1:20:58] so you can see what has happened it's to
[1:21:01] keep the people's minds distracted with
[1:21:03] politics and debate and church when the
[1:21:07] reality is you should be working out
[1:21:08] your own salvation with fear and
[1:21:10] trembling you should be seeking and
[1:21:11] searching after the Lord to make your
[1:21:13] calling and election Shore to make sure
[1:21:16] that Christ is actually in your vessel
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:20] so you can just go on and on with it and
[1:21:23] down through the Bible you go God's plan
[1:21:25] was always to in 12 man he said to
[1:21:28] Isaiah where is the place of my rest
[1:21:31] what house will you build on to me and
[1:21:33] where is the place of my rest but to
[1:21:35] this man will I look is that right and
[1:21:38] we heard last night in our Bible study
[1:21:40] that in Genesis 1 he was a spirit man
[1:21:42] but in Genesis 2 he was put in a temple
[1:21:45] God had a Feast of Tabernacles right
[1:21:48] there with Adam God tabernacled in a
[1:21:51] body right but when you read the passage
[1:21:53] it's in the Sabbath day Sabbath means
[1:21:56] rest God took rest when he entered into
[1:22:00] Adam that's the Sabbath what day of the
[1:22:04] week is the Sabbath seventh then what
[1:22:07] happened after that Eve came out
[1:22:09] went from a Sabbath day to a bride age
[1:22:12] riding the Garden of Eden is that right
[1:22:15] but in this glorious age when this
[1:22:17] Brides brought out right God had to open
[1:22:20] up Adam side bring forth Eve God had to
[1:22:23] open up Jesus side bring forth to alpha
[1:22:25] bride in these last days down comes
[1:22:27] Jesus with a book in his hand gives the
[1:22:29] mysteries out to a prophet the Prophet
[1:22:31] publicly speaks them out right the
[1:22:34] children of God with an ear to hear has
[1:22:36] been hearing what Christ is saying
[1:22:37] through that prophets message realize in
[1:22:39] her place in the plan of redemption and
[1:22:42] this Omega bride cannot fall like the
[1:22:46] alpha bride did like Eve did or Israel
[1:22:48] nobody that's the power of this our
[1:22:51] friend this endtime Brides predestinated
[1:22:54] to overcome everything now think about
[1:22:57] this by virtue of the fact that this is
[1:23:01] how it's pattern in the word this is the
[1:23:03] way you should believe it right if it's
[1:23:06] this way patterned out brother least
[1:23:08] that's the way we should expect it
[1:23:10] that's the way we should confess it
[1:23:12] that's the way we should live to it
[1:23:14] that's the way we should believe it the
[1:23:17] Alpha bride fell Eve fell Israel fell
[1:23:21] but there's something about this Omega
[1:23:24] bribed somebody identified to me what is
[1:23:27] it about this Omega bride that cannot
[1:23:30] fall how come she can't defy her skirts
[1:23:34] how come she can't fall short how come
[1:23:36] she can't be polluted and deluded how
[1:23:39] come the Antichrist can impregnate those
[1:23:41] other brides with this broad can't can
[1:23:44] you deal with it can you identify why do
[1:23:47] you understand how that's moving in your
[1:23:48] life do you know how that the womb has
[1:23:51] closed around the husband see today and
[1:23:54] same couldn't pregnant could not
[1:23:56] impregnate you if he tried they know
[1:23:59] false Antichrist teaching gonna be to
[1:24:01] pregnant this in time Brian that at all
[1:24:04] that's the power and the anointing and
[1:24:07] the reality of this age you should be
[1:24:10] understanding should be able to identify
[1:24:12] with that let me say it again calmly you
[1:24:16] have a historical fact that Brides fell
[1:24:23] Eve fell Israel fell
[1:24:27] Israel was Jehovah's bride she got
[1:24:30] corrupted pagan nations were just eating
[1:24:33] away paganism occultism evil spirits
[1:24:38] from the devil idolatry they was
[1:24:41] throwing their kids in the fire to a
[1:24:42] false God Moloch that was bound down the
[1:24:45] roots they was in all kinds of health
[1:24:47] Solomon set up golden horses in the
[1:24:50] temple for crying out loud
[1:24:51] in honor of false gods all that stuff
[1:24:56] was going on
[1:24:57] idolatry corrupted Israel that's why
[1:25:00] they went into a 70 year captivity is
[1:25:02] that right
[1:25:03] and when Jesus comes what are they all
[1:25:05] into Babylonian Talmud teaching for
[1:25:08] doctrines the commandments of men and
[1:25:10] making the Word of God of no effect
[1:25:12] all that influence was there and in
[1:25:16] these last days after seven church ages
[1:25:18] of the Gentiles you got tradition
[1:25:20] superstition denominationalism and
[1:25:23] organization all this Antichrist bunk
[1:25:25] but the Bible shows us God's gonna have
[1:25:27] a bride here without spot without
[1:25:29] wrinkle come out how does he achieve
[1:25:35] such a thing
[1:25:36] what's the details are you into it do
[1:25:39] you understand it do you see how it's
[1:25:41] been foreshadowed in the Bible well
[1:25:43] somebody here brother Bob has got to
[1:25:45] overcome all this Christ is the one
[1:25:48] doing it in his bride but there's a
[1:25:50] specific certain way there is a walk to
[1:25:53] walk there's a pattern there's something
[1:25:55] set it's specific it's outlined it's
[1:25:58] defined
[1:25:59] don't be so loose and you're thinking
[1:26:01] don't be so casual about the message
[1:26:03] young folks this is serious serious
[1:26:05] business spiritual scientists are
[1:26:08] working with things from the message
[1:26:09] from the Bible to put it together in
[1:26:11] these laboratories here to give you
[1:26:13] something to rise above
[1:26:14] the dread of this age that's right pay
[1:26:18] close attention to what the Spirit is
[1:26:19] saying through your ministry here watch
[1:26:22] and pray for the inspiration of the
[1:26:24] Spirit to flow freely to receive what
[1:26:26] Christ is saying I want to get ready to
[1:26:29] close but I want you to just encourage
[1:26:31] you I try to encourage people about this
[1:26:33] everywhere I go it's very simple but
[1:26:35] it's it's important in your personal
[1:26:37] private life spend time seeking the Lord
[1:26:41] pray and read your Bible don't just
[1:26:44] listen to a message to get finished with
[1:26:46] it listen carefully or read slowly and
[1:26:50] meditate I'm trying to teach my children
[1:26:53] my family about Christian meditation
[1:26:55] it's not how many chapters of the Bible
[1:26:58] you read it's not the quantity it's the
[1:27:01] quality
[1:27:02] what are you extracted from it how is it
[1:27:04] speaking to your life do you understand
[1:27:06] that's why Christian Fellowship is
[1:27:08] important the Lord inspires you about
[1:27:11] something

[1:28:07] between church services right poor old
[1:28:10] people today are so beat up and so
[1:28:11] drugged up don't even think about
[1:28:13] anything has to do with God so they walk
[1:28:14] in church
[1:28:15] here we are it's time to do to God thing
[1:28:17] again if that's your attitude you need
[1:28:20] to repent
[1:28:21] seek the Lord in your personal private
[1:28:24] life you'll find as you draw nigh to God
[1:28:26] God will draw nigh to you and inspire
[1:28:29] you
[1:28:30] friends don't tell you how it works Lee
[1:28:32] last night today I was meditating in
[1:28:34] Luke chapter 12 I know I'm supposed to
[1:28:36] bring the text out of that chapter what
[1:28:38] was read this morning Luke chapter 12
[1:28:41] that happens all the time my song leader
[1:28:45] will be singing the songs that I got
[1:28:47] notes here and I'm getting ready to
[1:28:48] preach its continuity of the Spirit if
[1:28:52] you can get in that channel of
[1:28:54] inspiration you can hear what God's and
[1:28:56] you find things in your heart you're
[1:28:58] meditating on God and you when you think
[1:29:00] and you pray and you ask questions well
[1:29:02] lo and behold you come to church and if
[1:29:04] the pastor don't get anointed to speak
[1:29:06] the very thing that you got going on in
[1:29:08] your heart then you know that's God
[1:29:10] speaking amen praise the Lord God bless
[1:29:15] you today how many understands what I've
[1:29:16] been sharing with you today the brides
[1:29:18] part amen amen
[1:29:23] so the Lord's will and we'll get into a
[1:29:25] few more things like that the Lord just
[1:29:27] has me recognized the continuity of
[1:29:30] these things and it's really just so
[1:29:33] scriptural this message message folks
[1:29:36] should understand their Bible better
[1:29:38] than anybody listen what brother branch
[1:29:41] says about this bride in church age book
[1:29:44] in the ephesian church age part of the
[1:29:47] book real fashionable clothes
[1:29:49] he says seven golden candlesticks in
[1:29:51] Exodus 20:5 31 it says endow shout make
[1:29:54] a candlestick of pure gold
[1:29:56] that's the bride he's talking about now
[1:29:58] of beaten work the bride's bleeding
[1:30:03] right in the other place in the church
[1:30:05] area brother Brad said this image will
[1:30:08] try to stop her ministers from teaching
[1:30:11] and preaching and given comfort to the
[1:30:13] people who's trying to stop the bride
[1:30:15] from preaching the bride don't need to
[1:30:18] be stopped
[1:30:19] read revelations 10 8 to 11 oh excuse me
[1:30:23] maybe you stopped at verse 7 you ain't
[1:30:24] got the clue huh the Lord told the bride
[1:30:29] thou must prophesy
[1:30:31] that's right she's got something she's
[1:30:34] got to say
[1:30:34] census knows that he's speaking out of
[1:30:36] her mouth but if you ain't got an ear to
[1:30:38] hear maybe you can't hear what Jesus is
[1:30:41] speaking to his bride today oh I just
[1:30:44] pressed play I bet you 99% of the people
[1:30:47] that just press play still in hearing
[1:30:49] what Jesus is saying you got to have the
[1:30:52] Holy Ghost with your press and play and
[1:30:55] hear they got the Holy Ghost thing you
[1:30:56] got the love of God then you got
[1:30:58] discernment and the mind of Christ you
[1:31:00] can hear what God saying to a pastor or
[1:31:02] to a tape you better hear the voice of
[1:31:06] Jesus Christ huh
[1:31:08] that's right anything about Jesus
[1:31:11] anything about him
[1:31:13] hearing the voice of the bridegroom so
[1:31:17] you need to pray for your pastor amen so
[1:31:19] Christ can flow and channel himself
[1:31:21] through the ministry and you catch
[1:31:23] continuity in the speaking and
[1:31:25] inspiration of the Holy Ghost so he says
[1:31:30] the beaten work shall the candlestick be
[1:31:32] made his shaft and his branches his bows
[1:31:34] his knobs and his flowers shall be the
[1:31:36] same the true Church of Jesus Christ the
[1:31:39] bride is likened to pure gold her
[1:31:43] righteousness is his righteousness her
[1:31:46] attributes are his own glorious
[1:31:48] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:31:53] and what he is she is to reflect and
[1:31:57] what he has she is to manifest there is
[1:32:00] no fault in her Amen what he has she is
[1:32:09] to manifest there's no fault in her she
[1:32:11] is all glorious within and without from
[1:32:15] beginning to end and she is the work of
[1:32:17] her Lord and all his works are perfect
[1:32:20] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:32:25] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:32:28] purpose of God I believe that's the
[1:32:30] answer I was looking for I said Lord why
[1:32:32] is it in the Bible that wisdom has
[1:32:34] always referred to as a her it's the
[1:32:37] bride
[1:32:38] brother Brown says in her in fact in her
[1:32:42] is summed up and manifested the eternal
[1:32:46] wisdom and purpose of God brother Brad
[1:32:49] says how can we fathom it
[1:32:50] how can one understand it though we
[1:32:52] cannot do that we can accept it by faith
[1:32:55] amen that's how God sees his bride oh
[1:32:58] how careful we should be with one
[1:33:00] another what you've done it to the least
[1:33:02] of these my brethren you've done unto me
[1:33:04] Jesus literally accounts this bride as
[1:33:07] part of himself
