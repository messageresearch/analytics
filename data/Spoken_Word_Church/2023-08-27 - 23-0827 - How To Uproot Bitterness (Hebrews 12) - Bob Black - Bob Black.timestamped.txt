[0:01] God bless your Saints good to be in the
[0:03] house of the Lord this morning
[0:05] you come expecting
[0:09] you come expecting we've got a promise
[0:11] you will receive what you expect
[0:15] let's just go the Lord in prayer as we
[0:17] get into our study Lord we just thankful
[0:19] Lord to be able to gather together
[0:20] around your word this morning in order
[0:22] we just ask that you'll bless the
[0:23] service today I pray God that shall just
[0:25] give the people what they have need of
[0:27] Lord and Lord that you'll bless our
[0:28] brothers he's preparing and studying and
[0:30] brother Louise with him Lord Jesus this
[0:32] bless the remainder of the services
[0:33] today we pray in your name
[0:36] now
[0:38] excuse me I I we about got to the end of
[0:42] uh Hebrews chapter 12 but I just began
[0:44] to meditate on these a couple of verses
[0:46] here 14 and 15 that I just kind of
[0:49] wanted to look at a little bit closer
[0:50] in the Hebrews 12 14 it says follow
[0:53] peace with all men
[0:55] and holiness
[0:56] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:00] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:03] the grace of God
[1:04] list any root of bitterness bringing up
[1:06] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:09] now let's look at the example he's using
[1:11] of what the scripture means he said
[1:12] let's lest there be any fornicator or
[1:15] profane person as Esau who for one
[1:17] morsel of meat sold his Birthright so
[1:19] misaw made a decision and then after
[1:22] afterwards he'd regretted that decision
[1:24] and um so it says for ye know how that
[1:27] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:28] the blessing he he was rejected
[1:31] before he found no place of repentance
[1:34] though he sought it carefully with tears
[1:36] and if you go back to Genesis 27 you can
[1:39] read how Esau just cried out it says
[1:42] with with bitterness he cried out
[1:44] bitterly and that's the example that
[1:47] Paul is using here in verse 15 he says
[1:49] it lists any root of bitterness you can
[1:51] see how bitterness will rise what causes
[1:54] bitterness really is uh
[1:56] I mean uh Esau was was expecting to
[2:01] receive the birthright and then because
[2:03] of the choices that he made his
[2:05] expectation was not met he did not meet
[2:08] the expectation was not fulfilled
[2:10] and that's what caused the bitterness to
[2:12] rise up now Paul is telling us to let's
[2:14] let's be careful that you know that the
[2:16] thing that we're expecting of course
[2:17] we're all expecting the the blessings
[2:20] from God and all these things that we're
[2:21] expecting so he's telling us he's
[2:22] warning us to make make sure we make
[2:24] right decisions but he's also wanting us
[2:26] to watch out for any root of bitterness
[2:28] and the root of bitterness will rise up
[2:30] if someone is expecting something and
[2:33] they don't get exactly what they expect
[2:34] and then that calls us something to
[2:36] begin to take place so let's narrow the
[2:39] focus down on these two verses
[2:42] follow peace with all men and holiness
[2:44] and looking diligently lest any man fail
[2:46] of the grace of God lest any root of
[2:47] bitterness springing up trouble you
[2:51] so as we examine bitterness this morning
[2:53] look at what brother Brandon said in
[2:54] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[2:56] said stay right together brother to
[2:57] write together if the brother you think
[2:59] he's a little wrong or the sister say
[3:01] Lord don't never not see these these
[3:03] lessons that we're we're learning about
[3:04] is how to deal with one another how to
[3:07] deal with situations so this morning I
[3:09] maybe we can just take a moment to
[3:10] inspect ourselves as you know it's it's
[3:13] helpful sometimes to expect inspect
[3:15] yourself and I'm you know just kind of
[3:18] compare yourself the way that you react
[3:19] and and and you know all of ourselves
[3:22] how we do things
[3:23] because like as one time I was sharing
[3:25] that uh experience with brother Marcus
[3:27] Becker where he said you know if you can
[3:29] really what we're really doing here is
[3:31] is we if you can understand yourself
[3:33] if I can understand myself and
[3:35] understand the re the way that I react
[3:36] and the way I respond to things and how
[3:38] things happen then that's what that's
[3:40] what this journey is really all about is
[3:42] understanding why why I am the way I am
[3:45] and how I can overcome
[3:46] and so here brother random said stay
[3:48] right together if the brother you think
[3:49] he's a little wrong or the sister say
[3:51] Lord don't love never don't let me never
[3:54] have the root of bitterness bring up
[3:55] because it'll affect him and it'll take
[3:57] the Christ right out of my life
[3:59] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[4:02] and hatred that will just take the Holy
[4:04] Spirit right away from you it will run
[4:06] him or run him from the Tabernacle Hill
[4:08] here it'll kill the spirit of God or
[4:11] drive it away from here hurt your pastor
[4:13] it'll do everything see don't you do
[4:16] that
[4:17] so now we want to examine this morning
[4:19] how do I if if I can examine myself and
[4:21] find that there's a root of bitterness
[4:23] or something how do I get rid of that
[4:24] what how do we tackle this problem it's
[4:26] like a gardener you know figuring out
[4:28] there's there's something I need to I
[4:30] need to pull up and and you go to Whedon
[4:32] and you pull up the things that aren't
[4:34] supposed to be there and you leave
[4:35] what's supposed to be there and and
[4:36] you're you're attending a garden
[4:38] Max Lucado said bitterness is like a
[4:41] rock thrown into a plastic pond it's
[4:43] like something that's small that gets
[4:45] started and it starts trickling out and
[4:46] becomes bigger and bigger until after
[4:48] you were like whoa where did that come
[4:49] from but this starts off real small
[4:52] after its initial Splash it sends out
[4:54] circular ripples that affect the whole
[4:56] pond
[4:57] Charles Spurgeon said The more
[4:58] bitterness you have in your heart the
[5:00] less room there is for the spirit of God
[5:02] unforgiveness chokes out the life of God
[5:06] when C.S Lewis said to be a Christian
[5:08] means to forgive the inexcusable because
[5:10] God has forgiven the inexcusable
[5:14] so now what what really where does with
[5:16] that bitterness that Paul was talking
[5:18] about that he was using the Esau as an
[5:20] example of that bitterness comes from
[5:23] anger and disappointment at being
[5:25] treated unfairly resentment so another
[5:27] let's let's take it take it deeper it's
[5:30] your expectation you're expecting to be
[5:33] treated in a certain way
[5:34] let's say for example maybe at work you
[5:36] go into your boss's office and you're
[5:38] and you're expecting him to be to agree
[5:40] with you and and he doesn't and you come
[5:43] out of there and something begins to
[5:44] start festering well I don't think I was
[5:46] treated it fairly or whatever and that
[5:48] little resentment begins to grow maybe
[5:51] maybe throughout your childhood you you
[5:54] didn't get the love that you felt like
[5:55] you needed to and it starts growing this
[5:57] This Bitter bitterness because you
[5:58] expected you expected something that you
[6:01] didn't get you you uh maybe maybe
[6:03] there's you just feel the devil's got
[6:06] you thinking a place where you don't you
[6:07] don't feel like you're worth nothing and
[6:09] uh you don't you know maybe somebody
[6:11] maybe you had a relationship where
[6:13] somebody cheated on you uh uh you know
[6:15] in in high school or wherever maybe
[6:17] maybe I hate to say it but maybe
[6:19] somebody's marital vial was broken and
[6:22] that caused you begin to to to be bitter
[6:25] and resentful and so these are the
[6:27] things that we're talking about maybe
[6:28] maybe somebody didn't have clothes or
[6:30] food on the table and they began to look
[6:32] at other people and think well why do
[6:33] they have a blessing let's see where
[6:35] that's what resentment can come to where
[6:37] you look at somebody else and their
[6:38] their life is blessed and it seems like
[6:40] that their every all their needs are
[6:42] being provided for
[6:44] maybe a young person looks at somebody
[6:45] else and sees their looks like their
[6:47] life is perfect or whatever and but
[6:49] because you think that you don't you're
[6:51] not getting what you deserve in your
[6:53] mind bitterness and resentment begins to
[6:55] grow
[6:56] and so all these things what it's all
[6:58] based
[6:59] on
[7:01] unrealistic expectations unrealistic
[7:03] expectations are premeditated
[7:05] resentments because you're going into
[7:07] the situation thinking I you got this
[7:10] expectation you already got it laid out
[7:11] how everything's going to pan out
[7:13] sometimes you know you you start coming
[7:15] to church and you've got an expectation
[7:17] of what church life is going to be and
[7:19] then it won't meet your expectations and
[7:21] the bitterness begins to grow in
[7:23] resentment because maybe maybe somebody
[7:25] is is invited to to sing a song and you
[7:29] feel like you should have been the one
[7:30] to sing it or something happened where
[7:32] you you know somebody else got treated a
[7:34] little bit maybe better somebody's name
[7:36] was mentioned from behind the pulpa and
[7:38] your name wasn't mentioned and then
[7:40] something begins to grow and fester
[7:41] something begins to like like that that
[7:44] uh what Max Lucado said that the pebble
[7:46] thrown into the pond they just looked
[7:49] and then it starts to grow and grow and
[7:51] grow
[7:53] now what are we talking about we're
[7:55] talking about how to how to deal with
[7:57] ourselves and with others because Paul
[8:00] said don't do like Esau where you you
[8:03] know you but you you you have these
[8:05] expectations that are not met and of
[8:07] course they weren't met in Esau's case
[8:09] because he made a bad decision and when
[8:11] he when his expectation for the for the
[8:14] birthright was not met he cried bitterly
[8:16] so you see where bitterness comes from
[8:18] it's from your expectation
[8:21] in Ephesians well let's go back to this
[8:24] quote so we want to brother Brown was
[8:26] saying God's provided a way of healing
[8:28] it you know he would explain how a a a a
[8:32] cancer or whatever starts from a bruise
[8:34] sale and he and it explains a sale
[8:36] that's backslidden they don't have a
[8:38] good healthy blood supply
[8:40] so what what the point is I'm not going
[8:42] to belabor the labor through reading all
[8:46] these quotes and everything but but just
[8:47] get to the point if you're you want to
[8:49] be a real healthy cell that has a real
[8:51] healthy relationship with God because
[8:53] God is where we get our supply maybe not
[8:55] so much from you know if you're relying
[8:58] so much on other people to to kind of
[9:00] feed you with a constant stream of
[9:02] adulation and and pats on the backs and
[9:04] things you know that's great and
[9:05] everything but one day that might fail
[9:07] and and where you get your your joy and
[9:11] your your your the Wellspring of
[9:13] everlasting life bubbling up within you
[9:15] your joy is from God so we want to be a
[9:18] real healthy sail in the body
[9:20] so that when when that little bitterness
[9:22] starts to grow out you can just you can
[9:24] you can stop it right in his tracks so
[9:26] that's what we're talking about this
[9:27] morning how do you deal with that
[9:29] bitterness like like Paul was saying
[9:32] Ephesians 4 Paul said let all bitterness
[9:35] and Wrath
[9:36] and anger
[9:38] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[9:41] from you with all malice and be kind one
[9:44] to another now see there's here's how
[9:47] you deal with listen the devil don't
[9:49] know how to deal with love the devil
[9:52] does not know how to deal with somebody
[9:54] being kind to somebody that's evil and
[9:57] that's you can see how the whole
[9:58] everything that Jesus preached was about
[10:00] reconciliation and restoration when
[10:03] somebody smikes you on the face you
[10:05] don't Smite them back and that was the
[10:07] Old Testament way an ear for an ear an
[10:09] eye for an eye and all those things but
[10:11] when somebody does so or you can stop it
[10:13] right in its tracks if you're in touch
[10:15] with God and have communion with God a
[10:17] relationship with God where you're not
[10:18] relying on external feedback for your
[10:20] joy and your strength but you're
[10:22] trusting in your maker you're trusting
[10:24] in your father for all your strength
[10:25] amen and that will stop the devil
[10:27] writing his tracks when you can show
[10:28] love to hate
[10:31] be kind one to another tenderhearted
[10:34] forgiving one another even as God for
[10:36] Christ's sake hath forgiven you
[10:39] now let's look it's bitterness is like a
[10:42] little plant growing it's like a seed
[10:43] and you can if you if you recognize what
[10:45] it is the devil trying to plant
[10:47] something in you you can say uh-uh I I
[10:50] don't want that and stop it right in
[10:51] this track so that's the best way to
[10:53] stop bitterness to stop it before it's
[10:54] planted right let's see look what it
[10:56] does and I know these are kind of small
[10:58] so I'm just going to skim through some
[11:00] of these it starts off with just
[11:02] bitterness starts off with just a little
[11:04] hurt experience and then it grows into
[11:06] resentment
[11:07] you start dwelling on it and then you're
[11:10] ruminating on it bitterness leads to
[11:13] constant rumination you all every day
[11:15] you wake up in the morning you're
[11:16] thinking about it and you go to sleep
[11:18] and you're thinking about it and it just
[11:20] rolls around in your head and then it
[11:22] turns into Grudge holding right yeah
[11:23] where grudges are prolonged feelings of
[11:26] bitterness where it might last years or
[11:28] months where you look back for years
[11:31] later and think still remember what
[11:33] somebody did to you because you never
[11:35] released it you never forgave that
[11:37] person and you see what what bitterness
[11:39] does it it hinders not the person that
[11:41] did the thing to you but it's hindering
[11:43] you
[11:44] that's why if you can understand
[11:45] yourself if we can understand ourselves
[11:48] then then we can be free of these things
[11:50] that the thing the trick of the devil to
[11:53] let some somebody do something maybe
[11:55] that hurts you and stung you and then it
[11:56] just impacts you maybe it was a bullet
[11:59] years ago in school that said something
[12:01] to you and the bully don't even remember
[12:02] but you've hung on to that and let it
[12:05] hinder you and and and and mess with
[12:08] your mind and uh building all these
[12:11] grudges and then it'll it'll it'll it
[12:13] look look what it does it keeps growing
[12:15] until
[12:15] it starts leading to manipulative
[12:17] Behavior where you're trying to control
[12:19] situations and people it escalates to
[12:22] hurtful Behavior because that's that's
[12:23] the Ripple in the pond it starts off
[12:25] with just bloop and now you're hurting
[12:28] other people in your life relationships
[12:29] you're hindering things it escalates out
[12:32] to stealth even to where people you know
[12:34] young people cutting themselves and
[12:36] doing all these things because they had
[12:38] expectations that were not met and that
[12:41] rippled and grew and grew and grew to
[12:43] the point where it started hurting
[12:47] and the Queen of Sheba brother Brown
[12:49] said somebody told me not long ago said
[12:51] brother Brown you know what happened
[12:53] this great organization is talking about
[12:55] that's always sponsor you you know what
[12:56] they did they ousted you they won't have
[12:59] nothing to do with you no more said they
[13:01] drove down their stake and said nobody
[13:03] received brother Brown anymore no think
[13:06] about that that would be something
[13:07] that's hurtful
[13:08] my goodness I've heard people tell
[13:10] stories about how that they were that
[13:12] one place brother random was supposed to
[13:13] speak at and he was supposed to be the
[13:16] speaker that night and then they got up
[13:17] behind the platform and said never mind
[13:19] uh brother Brown couldn't make it
[13:21] tonight and the brother looked over on
[13:22] the side and saw them escorting brother
[13:24] Brown him out and he was like what all
[13:27] these strange things happening in
[13:29] brother around his life and but brother
[13:30] random was mature enough to be able to
[13:32] handle it and look how he handled it he
[13:35] said I well I drove mine now I drove
[13:38] mine down too and went way out of past
[13:40] him and took them in that's just all of
[13:42] it that's that's all I take them in
[13:44] because a lot of God's children in there
[13:45] and that's right the message is to God's
[13:48] children not to any certain organization
[13:49] but to God's children
[13:52] they put me out I'll take them in by
[13:55] spreading mine a little wider and just
[13:56] take it in that's all so we must love
[13:58] one another keep the roots of bitterness
[14:01] out of us
[14:02] then God can go to working through us
[14:04] but till we get that then we're just
[14:06] fighting the wind true we got to love
[14:07] one another Jesus said by this all men
[14:09] will know you're my disciples right or
[14:12] wrong love anyhow so what can we do to
[14:16] keep bitterness from taking root
[14:18] let's go real deep okay let's study this
[14:21] out so we can examine ourselves
[14:23] first thing don't let it take root to
[14:25] begin with if the bitterness is like
[14:27] it's like a damn busty if the crack
[14:30] starts forming and before long the dam
[14:32] just all of a sudden you've got all this
[14:34] water coming through
[14:35] Proverbs 17 says the beginning of strife
[14:37] is as one one letteth out water
[14:39] therefore leave off contention before it
[14:43] be meddled with
[14:44] and uh second Samuel chapter 10 I was
[14:47] actually last night I was listening to
[14:49] brother Chad Lamb he was preaching a
[14:51] Wednesday night on this scripture the
[14:53] story of David and King noon and that is
[14:56] a that is a really awesome story if you
[14:59] go to listen to that what the story is
[15:00] about is David Goes King hanoon's father
[15:04] passed away so David's gonna go we'll
[15:07] say it like in modern terms he's going
[15:09] to send in some Hallmark cards and some
[15:11] greetings and some comfort and he goes
[15:13] and sends all these men to help him out
[15:14] well King hanoon
[15:16] his man got to tell him it's the devil
[15:19] got to tell him King David just wants to
[15:21] destroy you now see in that just like
[15:23] how the devil does sometimes and he got
[15:25] he got in his head that David wanted to
[15:28] destroy him but David was out he wanted
[15:30] to show love he was like I'm trying to
[15:33] help you out I'm sending you some
[15:34] casserole dishes I'm sending you some
[15:37] some broccoli surprise or whatever you
[15:39] know I'm I'm I'm sending you some help
[15:42] all these wagging loaves of help but
[15:44] King hanum got it in his head that David
[15:46] was out to destroy him that he was out
[15:48] for his hurt and and so instead of
[15:50] returning to love
[15:52] he said all right we're going to take
[15:54] these emissaries and we're going to cut
[15:55] half of their beard off and we're going
[15:57] to cook half of their garment off so
[15:59] that their their ear shows so that when
[16:01] they walk home they're walking home in
[16:03] shame and when David heard that he said
[16:05] okay
[16:07] and what did it do it started a war and
[16:10] see oh that's that's what the devil's
[16:12] tactic is he just wants he just wants to
[16:14] do stuff like that
[16:17] so there's step one don't don't even let
[16:20] it take root if you can recognize that
[16:22] it's the devil putting a thought in your
[16:24] mind about a brother or sister or
[16:25] something and say no I listen here's how
[16:29] you tackle Wilderness you begin to think
[16:30] about all the good things that that
[16:32] brother or that sister has done for you
[16:34] think about all the good things that
[16:36] your mother and father have done for you
[16:38] think about all the good things and that
[16:41] will begin to change your perception of
[16:43] the situation after king of noon had
[16:45] done that and begin to think well David
[16:47] was always there for my daddy he was
[16:50] always a comfort in time of need
[16:52] that would have changed the situation
[16:54] and they wouldn't have gone to war
[16:56] acknowledge your feelings now there's a
[16:58] there's a good first step the heart
[17:00] knoweth his own bitterness and a
[17:02] stranger does not enter medal with his
[17:04] Joy now what that means is is you know
[17:07] down in your heart whether you've got
[17:09] Joy or bitterness a stranger doesn't
[17:11] know you got joy if you've got real Joy
[17:14] nobody they're not really going to be
[17:16] able to enter into your joy like you can
[17:18] because it's in your heart and you you
[17:20] got that the same way with bitterness
[17:22] nobody really knows what what's in your
[17:24] heart but you so if you if you just
[17:26] really meditate y'all know how I'm a
[17:28] real fan of meditation and introspection
[17:30] if you just sit maybe in your car in the
[17:33] morning praying to God and thinking
[17:35] about you know is there anything like
[17:36] David used to pray is there anything
[17:38] wrong in my life is there anything
[17:40] that's that's off kilter you've been to
[17:42] think and really begin to acknowledge
[17:44] and think about your relationships is it
[17:46] is the reason why I act with this person
[17:49] or the reason why they treat me like
[17:51] this is it because of anything that I've
[17:53] done and you begin to acknowledge the
[17:55] things that are wrong in your life now
[17:57] so there is the first step to
[17:58] acknowledge now because if you don't
[18:00] know that there's bitterness in your
[18:01] life you can't handle it but if you
[18:03] recognize that there's bitterness then
[18:05] you can start to take action
[18:08] seek forgiveness
[18:09] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[18:11] another Paul said If any man have a
[18:13] quarrel against any even as Christ
[18:15] forgave you so also do you do ye no so
[18:19] there's the thing that if somebody does
[18:21] you wrong just be ready and quick to
[18:23] forgive them and to just release that
[18:25] from your life
[18:27] practice gratitude
[18:29] in everything give thanks for this is
[18:31] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[18:33] concerning you
[18:35] like we were saying when you come to
[18:37] church you come expecting to receive
[18:39] something and you'll you'll you you when
[18:42] when you
[18:44] oh when you look at things it how you
[18:47] look determines how you will see it like
[18:49] that Deacon that that roll around talked
[18:51] about that that little girl wanting to
[18:53] run around asking everybody how can I
[18:55] see God and everybody said no until she
[18:58] finally got in touch with that Deacon
[18:59] who said everywhere I look I see God
[19:01] so if you're looking for a fault in your
[19:04] brother or sister you'll find a fall
[19:06] because I tell you what we all got
[19:08] plenty of Falls if you if you're looking
[19:11] for a laundry list of things that you
[19:13] can point out with somebody you'll find
[19:15] plenty but if you're looking for the
[19:16] good if you're looking for something
[19:18] that you can say well wow that's
[19:21] I I'm glad that that person is in my
[19:23] life
[19:25] that's what this is about practice
[19:26] gratitude
[19:28] how about how about this let go and let
[19:30] God in Romans chapter 12 it says dearly
[19:32] beloved avenge not yourselves but rather
[19:35] give Place unto Wrath for it is written
[19:37] vengeance is mine I will repay saith the
[19:40] Lord and when you examine really what
[19:42] forgiveness is forgiveness is the
[19:45] ability to release that desire for
[19:48] vengeance because when somebody does you
[19:50] wrong it's a natural human inclination
[19:52] to say I I'm going to restore I'm going
[19:54] to repay them for what they did for I
[19:56] want this to be exposed I want this to
[19:58] be revealed I want everybody to know
[20:01] what a what a grievous thing this is but
[20:05] it's a supernatural thing when you say
[20:07] I'm just going to release it I'm gonna
[20:09] I'm gonna turn it over to God whatever
[20:11] God wants to have happen let it's it's
[20:14] up to him but it's not it's not my it's
[20:17] not my job to to seek out retribution or
[20:20] or Vengeance vengeance is the Lord's and
[20:24] how about this cultivate a forgiving
[20:26] heart
[20:28] Matthew chapter 6 said for if you
[20:30] forgive men their trespasses your
[20:33] heavenly father will also forgive you
[20:35] so if we want to be forgiven to forgive
[20:38] others but if you forgive men not not
[20:41] men their trespasses neither will your
[20:44] father
[20:45] forgive your trespasses
[20:47] let's dive a little bit further what
[20:49] what is forgiveness
[20:51] forgiveness is pardoning someone for a
[20:54] wrongdoing or offense
[20:56] pardoning is wiping it wiping it away
[20:58] and choosing not to hold their actions
[21:02] against them
[21:04] choosing not to hold so you're not like
[21:07] holding it in your heart and saying I'm
[21:08] I'm not going to hold it against them
[21:10] now but give me six months and then I'm
[21:14] going to release it
[21:15] thank you
[21:18] letting go of negative feelings
[21:21] resentments and the desire for revenge
[21:24] or retaliation towards someone who has
[21:27] wronged you
[21:28] an intentional decision to let go of
[21:32] resentment and anger now that's why
[21:34] prayer and introspection is so important
[21:37] for when you get along with God and you
[21:40] begin to Lord you know help me to help
[21:43] you know you sometimes you can pray help
[21:45] me help me to release this okay it's
[21:48] beyond my ability help me to help me to
[21:51] let these things go oh it's something
[21:54] Supernatural is happening in the life of
[21:56] a Believer when you really forgive
[21:59] somebody
[22:00] that's we're coming up we're coming up
[22:02] to brotherly kindness and all those
[22:03] things that's why Colossians 3 12 says
[22:05] put on therefore is the elect of God
[22:07] holy and beloved bowels of mercies Mercy
[22:10] coming from within from deep within
[22:13] kindness
[22:15] humbleness of mine meekness long
[22:19] suffering now what's what's the devil
[22:22] going to do with something like that
[22:24] the devil gets in amongst the people but
[22:26] they've got something flowing from
[22:28] inside that's so kind and long-suffering
[22:32] that you can just berate and beat and
[22:34] and uh conk somebody over their head
[22:36] over and over but because they've got a
[22:39] relationship with God and there's a
[22:41] bubbling Wellspring of Life coming up
[22:43] within you just can't do anything to
[22:45] that person
[22:47] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[22:50] another If any man have a quarrel
[22:51] against any even as Christ forgave you
[22:54] so do also he
[22:58] Matthew Chapter 5 said you have heard
[23:00] that it has been said an eye for an eye
[23:01] on a tooth for a tooth I got this
[23:03] picture over here of Jesus putting that
[23:04] man's ear back on
[23:06] but look what look what the lesson Jesus
[23:08] is trying to Peter he saw Jesus being
[23:11] wrong and he immediately whipped his
[23:13] sword out which is our reaction a lot of
[23:16] times when we see something you know
[23:19] something a little bit off here comes
[23:21] the sword
[23:22] I love you know where you really start
[23:24] studying things out and you can see
[23:25] these little relationships between the
[23:27] disciples why why I'm just putting a
[23:29] little question why is it that Matthew
[23:30] said you know I don't know who cut the
[23:33] ear off of this garden and Mark said I
[23:35] don't know we can't say Luke said I
[23:38] don't know but John was like it was
[23:40] Peter
[23:42] you did it
[23:45] your first Peter said for for even here
[23:48] unto where you call because Christ also
[23:50] suffered for us leaving us an example
[23:53] that ye should follow his steps who did
[23:56] no sin neither was God found in his
[23:59] mouth
[24:00] who when he was reviled
[24:02] reviled not again when he suffered he
[24:06] threatened not but committed to him
[24:08] committed himself to him that judgeth
[24:12] righteously now every Christian wants to
[24:14] be like Jesus and that's all of our road
[24:17] map that we're trying to we're trying to
[24:19] get to a place where we're like Jesus he
[24:22] is our example that's what we're trying
[24:24] to model our life after in trying to be
[24:26] like to where there's no guile in our
[24:28] mouth to where when somebody reviles us
[24:30] we don't revile back that when we suffer
[24:33] we don't threaten back
[24:35] when anything was uh he was able to deal
[24:38] with any situation in Luke chapter 6 it
[24:41] says but I say unto you which here love
[24:43] love your enemies
[24:45] do good to them which hate you bless
[24:48] them that curse you and pray for them
[24:50] which despitefully use you and unto him
[24:53] the samothy on the One Cheek offer also
[24:55] the other and him that taketh away thy
[24:57] cloak forbid not to take that coat also
[25:01] that's a that seems like a pretty big
[25:03] ass doesn't it but that's what God is
[25:06] asking us to do in first Thessalonians 5
[25:08] 15 he said see that none render evil for
[25:12] evil
[25:13] unto any man
[25:14] what's something else I can do to keep
[25:16] bitterness from from overtaking is
[25:19] practice self-control and James 1 it
[25:22] says be wherefore my beloved Brethren
[25:24] let every man be swift to hear be quick
[25:28] to listen just listen to somebody
[25:30] we're so quick to just talk over one
[25:32] another and Buddy in and not listen like
[25:35] but listen
[25:36] oh you find all these Proverbs all these
[25:40] lessons in the New Testament about close
[25:42] your mouth and open your ears oh if we
[25:45] could follow those simple rules that
[25:46] would take care of a lot of things Swift
[25:48] to ear here slow to speak slow to Wrath
[25:52] for the wrath of man worketh not the
[25:55] righteousness of God
[25:57] amen and let's get rid of all the
[25:58] negative thoughts that's what Paul or in
[26:00] Philippians he said finally Brethren
[26:02] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[26:04] things are honest whatsoever things are
[26:05] just whatsoever things are pure
[26:07] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[26:09] things are of good report if there be
[26:10] any virtue and if there be any praise
[26:12] think on these things so when you're
[26:15] driving home from work and you're
[26:16] thinking about how your wife ain't cause
[26:18] she probably ain't gonna have dinner
[26:19] ready for she's get rid of those
[26:22] negative thoughts think something
[26:23] positive when when you're when you're
[26:25] riding around you're thinking about that
[26:27] person at church that just did something
[26:28] wrong to get rid of that negative
[26:30] thought and think about all the good
[26:32] things because I guarantee you that
[26:34] we've got plenty of good things to think
[26:35] about we've got all we've got things to
[26:38] think about the benefits of God what God
[26:40] did for us to people that just so many
[26:42] things that go on and on
[26:45] and Release Control
[26:47] just put it in God cast everything over
[26:49] to God be still and know that I am God I
[26:52] will be exhausted among the Heathen I
[26:54] will be exalted in the earth yes
[26:59] and pray
[27:01] because Bible says he healeth the broken
[27:03] and heart
[27:04] and bindeth up their wounds
[27:08] and practice love
[27:10] be your kind one to another
[27:12] tenderhearted forgiving one another
[27:15] even as Christ even as God for Christ's
[27:17] sake hath forgiven you yes brother Brown
[27:20] said love one another above everything
[27:22] love one another no matter what the
[27:24] devil tries to say now this is supposed
[27:26] to be a picture of somebody in church
[27:28] spreading poison it's kind of hard to
[27:31] make that out maybe but he's in a church
[27:33] spreading poison he said now you're all
[27:34] one great big sweet group now
[27:37] but remember my warning see Satan won't
[27:40] let that stay that way Satan's gonna do
[27:42] just like he tried to do the king Hanan
[27:44] get in there and spread put a lie in
[27:46] somebody's mind somebody's trying to
[27:48] come with love and you uh they're
[27:50] they're out for evil he'll shoot
[27:52] everything if he has to bring somebody
[27:54] in to make his Target
[27:56] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[27:58] and sitting down and cause him to
[28:01] fellowship with you under the quietness
[28:02] and things and then he'll shoot that guy
[28:04] with some kind of a poison stuff just
[28:06] like in this picture here and he'll
[28:08] start through the church with it don't
[28:10] you take sides with it don't you have
[28:12] nothing to do with anything else you
[28:15] stay right loving and sweet and kind to
[28:17] one another pray for that man that he'll
[28:20] be saved too or that woman or ever who
[28:22] it is just pray for them and stick one
[28:26] with another
[28:28] now that's what Paul was talking about
[28:30] as we close and the musicians come
[28:31] forward Paul was talking about don't be
[28:33] bitter
[28:34] like Esau was and the Esau was bitter
[28:38] because his expectation of the of the
[28:41] promise was not met of course he made
[28:43] the bad decision but when our
[28:45] expectations are not mad
[28:48] let's don't be bitter God bless you
[28:54] foreign
