[5:02] we've had a good time of rest and in all
[5:07] of different ministers ministry and I
[5:10] really enjoyed them we've had a good
[5:11] time and all of that so now we get back
[5:14] into regular routine alright alright
[5:19] first Peter watch what Peter goes and
[5:21] says for as much as you know that you
[5:24] were not redeemed with corruptible
[5:26] things as silver and gold from your vain
[5:29] conversation received by tradition from
[5:31] your father's but with the precious
[5:34] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[5:37] blemish and without spot Hoover Lee was
[5:40] foreordained before the foundation of
[5:43] the world who was manifest in these last
[5:45] times for you who by him do believe in
[5:49] God
[5:49] that
[5:50] raise him from the dead and gave him
[5:53] glory that your faith and hope might be
[5:56] in God all right seeing you have
[5:59] purified your souls and obeying the
[6:01] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[6:04] in other words why heart the West you do
[6:07] love of the Brethren since you love one
[6:10] another with a pure heart fervently
[6:12] being born again not a corruptible seed
[6:15] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[6:18] which liveth and abideth for ever now
[6:22] the one thing I would say for you to do
[6:25] is in the next I don't know another week
[6:29] or two we're going on but sometimes in
[6:32] your studies in the scriptures
[6:34] I'll take the virtues write them down on
[6:38] a piece of paper lay them down the side
[6:41] of your Bible while you're reading and
[6:43] as you do note the times those words are
[6:48] used in the Bible well just to just
[6:54] write it down you know right faith
[6:56] virtue or knowledge just let it out side
[6:58] of your Bible then when you're reading
[7:00] because he says here are the unfeigned
[7:02] the love of the Brethren brotherly low
[7:06] okay see this do that it may help as we
[7:10] come along all right now we go to John
[7:14] to be glad then you children of Zion and
[7:19] rejoice in the Lord your God for he has
[7:22] given you the former rain moderately and
[7:25] he will cause to come down for you the
[7:27] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[7:30] in the last month and the floor shall be
[7:34] full of wheat and the fat shall overflow
[7:36] with wine and all what a wonderful thing
[7:39] to be thinking about and I will restore
[7:41] to you the years that the locusts have
[7:44] eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[7:47] Palma worm my great army which I sent
[7:50] among you you may be seated and as I
[7:53] always say when I read that scripture
[7:55] when it says my great army I sent among
[7:58] you now don't think about God sending
[8:01] the cankerworm Pama worm low
[8:03] the caterpillar you know he didn't send
[8:07] that he permitted that to come into
[8:10] being to test and try you and me it
[8:15] didn't come from him you have no way to
[8:17] bring those wrong things from Christ so
[8:20] I always mention that when I read that
[8:22] scripture because I want your thoughts
[8:24] to be in that line you say look at our
[8:26] God sent to can come war upon war and
[8:28] locals can know God permitted it wage is
[8:31] doing a wonderful job on the horse from
[8:34] riders and the things so stay with that
[8:36] part all right now I want to just review
[8:42] just a little bit tonight but then I
[8:44] have a thought I want to to put forth to
[8:48] you and I hope you've followed me up to
[8:52] the time to where we're at and what
[8:54] we're talking about now we've covered
[8:58] how that you know the church came into
[9:03] being we've covered how that on the day
[9:07] of Pentecost that as the church went
[9:11] forth that that church was God living in
[9:16] the people and all like that and
[9:18] bringing it down and that was his
[9:20] purpose to die that he could pay the
[9:23] price of our sin and I spent a lot of
[9:26] time emphasizing a lot of things that I
[9:30] hope will be very helpful
[9:33] once we proceed another message or so
[9:36] all right so don't get bored out in what
[9:39] I'm trying to say just listen and try to
[9:43] follow along because and to me it brings
[9:47] us to a lot of things you know it may
[9:51] not mean nothing to you but yet I
[9:53] believe it's dire and it's there for a
[9:55] reason for us to understand just like to
[9:59] be able to understand that on the day of
[10:02] Pentecost there was a hundred and twenty
[10:05] in the upper room that had been tutored
[10:08] for three and a half years right walk
[10:12] with the Lord Jesus and questioned him
[10:15] and he he you know
[10:17] he answered their questions and told him
[10:19] the parables and what they meant other
[10:21] than speaking a parable out here and
[10:23] then they would go privately and asked
[10:26] him questions and he would answer and
[10:27] explain those things unto that hundred
[10:31] and twenty they were tutored all right
[10:33] then when the Holy Ghost fell it put
[10:37] them to the position to where that they
[10:39] would be called the faith of the fathers
[10:42] are the Apostles faith faith revelation
[10:45] understanding we see then immediately
[10:49] you see an odd thing transpiring that
[10:52] you see a few hours later three thousand
[10:57] people receiving the Holy Ghost that had
[11:00] never heard all of this no tutoring no
[11:02] training no no that doesn't mean
[11:05] anything to you I mean to me it's like
[11:08] the difference in a college graduate in
[11:10] the first grader I mean that's what I
[11:12] would the way I look at it you know I
[11:14] mean the college graduates went through
[11:16] school to learn to get to a position and
[11:18] worthy of them and you are honor them
[11:21] for that within here comes somebody
[11:22] alone and remote he used to make a
[11:26] comical statement and he calling them
[11:28] third grade how they said third grade
[11:31] educational kids you know because that's
[11:33] what it is so you you you you go into
[11:36] school you know and and you go to school
[11:38] for a little while and it's all
[11:40] repetitive repetitive repetitive and you
[11:43] get over about the fourth grade and they
[11:44] say okay let's say our ABCs I've done
[11:52] that for four years yeah because it's
[11:55] come to find out whether you know them
[11:57] or not and probably listening to Ana and
[12:00] the way they teach probably a lot of
[12:02] kids it was would be in the fourth grade
[12:04] would not be able to recognize those
[12:09] letters meaning right as they are and
[12:12] they are in their mind ABCD Cody yeah
[12:17] that's it they didn't went through that
[12:19] song right you don't you don't get what
[12:22] I mean okay what I mean is one time
[12:25] those recite those disciples that were
[12:28] called it's toppled in apostles later
[12:30] all right there were followers until
[12:34] they become the ones who had the word
[12:36] within them as apostles okay they walked
[12:40] with the Lord Jesus for three and a half
[12:42] years right but those others only heard
[12:45] one sermon and got the Holy Ghost now
[12:49] are you going to say that this group got
[12:52] a Holy Ghost and this got this group got
[12:55] another Holy Ghost but one says there's
[12:57] not but one Holy Ghost no the Bible says
[13:00] one faith one Lord one baptism them all
[13:03] right see now there is the point of God
[13:06] degreeing our degree in ever how you use
[13:10] your terminology that things can be in
[13:14] this away brother branham I got a quote
[13:16] laying here to worry he said Martin
[13:18] Luther he said he had the baptism of the
[13:21] Holy Spirit mm-hmm whether you'd be
[13:25] surprised how many people this message
[13:27] wouldn't agree with that statement
[13:29] but he said Martin Luther had the
[13:31] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[13:32] all right that's off the message why I'm
[13:37] against organized religion in 1962 11:00
[13:43] 11:00 in the evening remember I believe
[13:46] that Martin Luther had the Holy Spirit
[13:48] absolutely maybe not in the portion it
[13:53] is today because it wasn't given out
[13:56] remember it was not the Holy Spirit that
[14:00] was eaten away in the ages it was the
[14:02] word but then as the word was eaten away
[14:06] the Holy Ghost could only work in the
[14:08] amount of word that the people had
[14:11] that's why this age would not be
[14:14] responsible for this age each one all
[14:17] right see then that away the Holy Ghost
[14:19] is it came on the 3,000 outside and
[14:21] brother Branham will state it and a lot
[14:23] of people say I don't see how brother
[14:25] Branham could say that that that they
[14:27] had the Holy Ghost
[14:28] just like on the day of Pentecost well
[14:31] if you just think on that Pentecost you
[14:34] had 3000 you had 120 120 the Holy Ghost
[14:40] gave them and if you're gonna call it
[14:43] brotherly kindness Holy Spirit
[14:44] but one said they had these virtues but
[14:47] they didn't how the headstone okay now
[14:49] you solve it with him with that 3,000
[14:52] doubts I didn't get the baptism of the
[14:53] Holy Ghost as the faith of the father
[14:56] I've tried to express that over to you
[14:59] to get you to follow this just tonight
[15:02] of one thought all right every age then
[15:10] run instead I'll give it quotes in a
[15:12] minute you ought to know him he said
[15:13] ever age is the age of the Holy Ghost
[15:15] there's one whole section in the church
[15:18] age will cause the Holy Ghost in each
[15:20] age or something like that to go all
[15:22] right so you can't say well this group
[15:25] had the Holy Ghost but this group didn't
[15:27] have the Holy Ghost now how are you
[15:28] gonna say that
[15:31] now how are you gonna make him Hebrews
[15:33] 13:8 right all right now how are you
[15:40] gonna degree it then we'll get to it in
[15:44] a minute if I don't I'll just go through
[15:45] the Masons and free but around them on
[15:47] the future homie said he taught three
[15:48] processes all the way through they
[15:51] always talk to three processes just in
[15:53] case in case baptism the Holy Ghost he
[15:55] said he always talk to him for my boy
[15:57] said he said I never changed one out all
[16:02] right then
[16:03] that means what now how would you
[16:06] sisters like it if you had seven stages
[16:10] of a birth of a baby and this one has
[16:14] got to have it this away with the water
[16:16] blood spirit water bloating and all at
[16:18] once here comes one just gets with a
[16:19] water and they're here knowing your
[16:22] sister has got enough sense to know that
[16:23] ain't right
[16:24] I mean every baby's born unless it's a
[16:28] cesareans or something happening ever
[16:30] normal baby is what water blood and baby
[16:35] are life
[16:36] all right now see then that way that's
[16:40] the same way with ever Church age in
[16:44] other words are you thinking that Martin
[16:46] Luther only had justification now that
[16:53] was the age of justification Martin
[16:55] Luther had the new birth of that age
[16:58] but Reynolds says John Wesley added the
[17:02] new birth let's see new birth of Wesley
[17:06] under sanctification of sanctification
[17:08] the new birth well now if you're
[17:12] listening what I've been trying to bring
[17:13] and then I want to drop back all right
[17:16] now so bear with me
[17:18] this is your adult more understanding
[17:20] all right
[17:22] did Martin Luther just get the Holy
[17:24] Ghost without repenting is that what
[17:29] you're saying or was his holy ghost just
[17:33] repenting or what are you trying to say
[17:39] if you don't believe they have the new
[17:41] birth you see the point I'm trying to
[17:48] drive that if you'd like to get a little
[17:53] piece of paper laying in wagers it's the
[17:56] house where some of you already read it
[17:58] about the sister explaining some things
[18:00] they believe in the Philippines about
[18:04] the new birth
[18:06] I've told you brother branham said it
[18:10] was the most missed out was the baptism
[18:13] when the whole to go now
[18:17] you said well what do with it all right
[18:19] did you remember this quote that a
[18:22] random says if you don't know what you
[18:25] got how do you know whether you guys or
[18:29] not now I didn't make these statements
[18:33] have I become your enemies because I
[18:36] found the truth written in the message
[18:38] to express something see then it's been
[18:42] so missed out until people don't know
[18:45] we'll see this group said let's just
[18:46] believe this cuz then this group comes
[18:48] up it's believe what I got then it's all
[18:53] related comes in said to believe the
[18:57] Prophet and now look at all of the
[19:01] flings off but a random wasn't that
[19:05] confused then come on
[19:08] he wasn't that confused to bring out all
[19:11] these
[19:12] so there must be something wrong
[19:14] somewhere
[19:15] all right now but yet trying to get to
[19:20] the point see the church started out on
[19:25] the day of Pentecost and a wonderful
[19:29] position of the Holy Ghost falling upon
[19:34] those who had been tutored by the word
[19:38] the word himself was there with him and
[19:41] when the Holy Ghost failed look what it
[19:43] gave them a great understanding of the
[19:47] Holy Ghost
[19:48] they were chosen to write the word you
[19:54] don't see the three thousand and then
[19:56] chosen to write the word not if they
[19:59] didn't know a lot about God but you
[20:00] don't see it it's the ones that were of
[20:03] that original are either related to the
[20:06] original and understanding remember how
[20:08] we brought out the Apostle Paul he never
[20:12] stayed with them and listen to them he
[20:14] went to himself but he was a prophet he
[20:17] had to do it for that part and he came
[20:18] out preaching the same thing that Peter
[20:22] was preaching Peter was just called a
[20:24] statue a perfect man Paul was calling an
[20:26] adoption it's the same thing the same
[20:30] situations we'll get back to those later
[20:32] as we're trying to do but all right
[20:35] now what is the new birth well say well
[20:43] we were with the new birth is he's I
[20:46] shouted I've spoken to her I hope we're
[20:48] above all of that somebody asking you
[20:50] what is the new birth I hope we're to
[20:53] the point of where the Prophet said
[20:54] Christ the mystery of God revealed that
[20:57] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[20:58] Christ personally to you and he said
[21:11] owns the spoken word is regional see
[21:13] paragraph 1 51 that it's the birth of
[21:17] the word is Christ
[21:23] the work birth of the word is Christ
[21:27] let's see we take that now and we make
[21:31] it some hard thing to comprehend
[21:35] you know when the Prophet said on crisis
[21:39] of mystery of God revealed that he could
[21:42] be revealed to the most illiterate
[21:45] person a lot of don't believe that okay
[21:51] you're an unbeliever is that far enough
[21:55] you're an unbeliever because I didn't
[21:58] say that your prophet is the one that
[22:01] said down huh see to the most illiterate
[22:05] person they can be saved will see the
[22:12] most illiterate person didn't have all
[22:13] the understanding the Apostle that are
[22:17] you getting the difference between 120
[22:20] and a 3,000 why would Paul come along
[22:24] and call them babes why would Peter call
[22:27] them babes desiring the sincere milk is
[22:29] worth who's he talking to
[22:33] we'll get to it in in the message in
[22:36] another message or so verse of like
[22:39] precious faith Peter wasn't writing the
[22:44] Bible Bibles not written to sinner's
[22:45] he's written to Christians sinners can
[22:49] only read it and I realize they're
[22:51] sinners are lost
[22:55] what's do we get through that I didn't
[22:57] men in them but listen the word made
[23:03] alive is the new birth each age the
[23:09] Prophet said had an amount of word to
[23:14] that age do you agree alright now and
[23:19] see the Holy Ghost quickening that word
[23:22] to that age would give the birth of the
[23:26] word to that age in each age as the
[23:30] birth of the word see that puts you back
[23:33] into the scripture in
[23:34] Matthew 13 36 through 39 where it says
[23:38] that the Son of Man is the sower of the
[23:40] seed there's no new birth without the
[23:44] son of man so in the seed all right then
[23:48] the Holy Ghost can quicken what he sowed
[23:52] Holy Ghost can't quicken it if it's not
[23:54] so damned see then he says the children
[23:59] of the kingdom are the children of God
[24:03] right
[24:04] and he said the children of the wicked
[24:07] one are the children of the devil all
[24:10] right you know but the son of man is the
[24:14] sower of the seed he preached the word
[24:18] the Holy Ghost made it alive and there's
[24:22] the new birth is not as what I got it I
[24:29] just got it I just I just accepted it
[24:31] see that's what we've come to we've come
[24:36] to shake hands we've come to a point and
[24:39] it went from one extreme to the other
[24:41] one just what do you believe that yeah
[24:43] okay you're safe in the other road you
[24:47] believe it yeah but you ain't smoking
[24:48] tongues yet you see what I'm getting at
[24:51] you going this way you caught that away
[24:54] then where's the truth each one had
[24:58] truth the words the truth if you were
[25:04] asked to explain the new birth what
[25:07] would you say if somebody came to you
[25:12] and said what must I do to be saved
[25:15] you know what brother Ron said we'd tell
[25:17] them what not to do what to quit and if
[25:20] that in the other said they didn't ask
[25:22] that question they would tell them about
[25:26] a book of rules or something or
[25:30] something to do right well that would
[25:37] put the new birth into some kind of a
[25:39] way of it trying to figure it out that's
[25:41] why I've read that scripture in Peter
[25:44] because he's talking about you were not
[25:47] redeemed
[25:49] what I would Peter talk about that you
[25:52] are not redeemed with corruptible things
[25:55] of life why would he mention that we
[26:05] don't say well let's throw this out I
[26:08] throw that no that's what it looks like
[26:11] but no he's talking about that she
[26:16] wasn't redeemed by these corruptible
[26:19] things or doctrines or ideas because you
[26:27] can't be redeemed that away it's got to
[26:31] be a revelation of Jesus Christ
[26:32] personally to you then I ran them on to
[26:44] Smyrna Church age every age and the age
[26:48] of the age of the Holy Ghost to the true
[26:51] believer every age ever born-again
[26:55] believer now let's get that point ever
[26:58] born to getting believer whether it be
[27:01] Ephesus all the way to the lady of sila
[27:05] ever born-again believer is born again
[27:09] the same way right I mean that shouldn't
[27:15] be something that you well I don't think
[27:16] that's right well my lord what have you
[27:19] got it make it something that can be our
[27:24] cousin brother Branham we've been
[27:25] through those things right that's why
[27:27] I've been through what did he say the
[27:28] evidence of the Holy Ghost was in every
[27:31] age evidence of the Holy Ghost never
[27:38] changed one age the new bird never
[27:40] changed when one age until the evidence
[27:43] of the Holy Ghost has always been
[27:44] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[27:46] with the word right okay see then you
[27:52] putting it on to the basis the word you
[27:56] got something that you can anchor down
[27:59] to
[28:02] he said yeah but we got no I've got some
[28:05] quotes in your minute I'll get to it in
[28:06] time
[28:07] better run said we got the same Holy
[28:10] Ghost that they had on the day of
[28:13] Pentecost hey you like this one
[28:18] he said we got the same Holy Ghost it
[28:20] let Abraham hey like that one cuz Abel
[28:25] one Holy Ghost
[28:26] he ain't saying that way bruh ham had
[28:29] the new birth he's not explaining
[28:31] something like that that's the confusion
[28:35] when you get into the statue of a
[28:37] perfect man you'll be talking about
[28:39] patience and they say look here they
[28:41] ground that patience Abraham had to
[28:43] invert you don't tell me dad you're
[28:46] virtuous no that's not that's not what
[28:48] he's talking about but that's where
[28:52] we're reading it all right see the Holy
[28:58] Ghost then would have to be the same in
[29:01] each age or he would not be Hebrews 13:8
[29:09] in being that being Hebrews 13:8 and C
[29:19] or - no I got these written down in
[29:21] front of it the same Holy Ghost they
[29:26] fell onto that Pentecost is the same
[29:29] Holy Ghost to give you a new birth well
[29:35] yeah a lot of people don't have don't
[29:38] believe you have the new birth like the
[29:40] head on the dip in a college with it
[29:44] what have you got you got one age
[29:51] getting born-again and require
[29:53] justification same occasion the
[29:54] baptismal okay you come to another age
[29:57] and you just required justification or
[30:01] maybe move up to the next when you
[30:02] required justification sanctification
[30:04] that's what it sounds like because the
[30:08] Prophet will bring it down to this is
[30:09] the age of the full restoration of the
[30:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost like the day
[30:14] of Pentecost
[30:18] but Church think about it the one thing
[30:23] that is the most important thing in the
[30:27] world is whether or not you're born
[30:31] again yet look at the confusions about
[30:39] that thought there's been made
[30:42] everything in the book to call it the
[30:46] new birth well then if it's that for you
[30:51] now it would be the same for Luther or
[30:54] Wesley a pentacle you see that's what
[31:01] I'm trying to get us to see if God is
[31:07] the same the Holy Ghost is the sign it
[31:11] was never eaten down
[31:13] it was never eaten away in the church
[31:16] ages the word was what was it eaten away
[31:20] and it never went all the way remember
[31:22] went down to the roots and it started
[31:27] coming back out and Luther Wesley
[31:29] Pentecost the brother branham could be
[31:32] so much to try to explain he would
[31:34] explain Luther in one message as a
[31:36] reformer explain him in another message
[31:40] as a prophet explain him as the church
[31:43] age bastard explain him as working in
[31:47] justification to bring forward
[31:49] restoration as if we look at it we just
[31:55] take which one we won't but that's what
[32:00] I want you to get if you don't get
[32:02] nothing out of anything tonight I want
[32:04] you to get one time the new birth in
[32:08] every age has been the same ever natural
[32:12] birth of a baby natural birth nothing
[32:16] ever natural birth of a baby is the same
[32:25] it might be a little difference in the
[32:28] happenings of this or that or the other
[32:30] are a little quicker in some situation
[32:32] are some kind of a thing but it's the
[32:34] same thing water breaks blood comes baby
[32:43] well my wife she just bypassed all them
[32:47] she did no she didn't bypass none of it
[32:53] well right then there's no way to bypass
[32:55] the baptism when the whole to go so
[32:58] you're gonna have to say the Holy Ghost
[32:59] was the same in every age it was the way
[33:02] people believed was what made the
[33:04] difference Martin Luther had the baptism
[33:12] of the Holy Ghost sure maybe not locking
[33:18] the next age because more is required
[33:19] but it was still the baptism it was
[33:23] still the new birth are you with me
[33:27] you can't make it to baptism in one age
[33:30] and something else in another age and
[33:33] call him Hebrews 13:8 you've got to have
[33:41] it at least leave it to her that you can
[33:43] understand that the new birth on the
[33:48] depth Pentecost was eternal life in the
[33:50] soul of mankind the new birth in Martin
[33:55] Luther's age was a baptism of the Holy
[33:58] Ghost eternal life into your soul
[34:05] church I face that for all of because
[34:08] I've heard people stand right here and
[34:10] try to explain the Luthor name didn't
[34:13] how the holding us even to the Zeus the
[34:15] streets didn't have the baptism of the
[34:17] holy God and I've told a man personally
[34:20] the one I'm talking about I told him
[34:22] personally gave him the quotes we were
[34:24] down the gills with eating he came right
[34:26] here that night and preached and
[34:28] preached that Azusa streets was false
[34:34] but everybody's gonna listen to him but
[34:42] you see one that I have to believe one
[34:44] thing if God is God he's the same
[34:49] and whatever call he he required for one
[34:52] to be born again he required the same
[34:54] for another the age has changed remember
[34:59] this quote the age has changed well God
[35:02] don't change the age would change to the
[35:05] age of justification and be an
[35:08] unfulfilled age or not a complete age
[35:12] Wesley would be sanctification to bring
[35:16] it to another stage the baptism of the
[35:19] Holy Ghost on Azusa Street another stage
[35:22] amen but it was still the baptism went
[35:25] on to go well did Luther get it just
[35:28] about what what did he get let me just
[35:39] make a few statements here they don't
[35:40] want to preach much on my heart
[35:45] according to the message and he'll have
[35:48] to pull them up your to know it they can
[35:50] if they want to according to the message
[35:53] of the future home the prophet of God
[35:57] said that he always talked three stages
[36:04] what was those three stages
[36:07] justification sanctification the baptism
[36:10] when the Holy Ghost the three stages now
[36:14] you're regardless of what we believe
[36:16] you're going to have to say that anybody
[36:19] that if one got it that way everybody
[36:21] gets it that way right if one got it
[36:26] that way everybody gets it that way or
[36:28] what are you gonna try to make it degree
[36:31] it here degree at Dhahran to the baptism
[36:35] of the Holy Ghost is the baptism when
[36:36] the Holy Ghost all right so the Prophet
[36:40] starts out on the future home then he
[36:43] starts explaining if you'll go to about
[36:45] page 15
[36:48] and start with him he explains what
[36:52] happens at justification he explains
[36:59] that justification chops off your pie
[37:02] sins says nothing he says does nothing
[37:07] to the future or anything does it just
[37:11] chopped off your pie stems so look what
[37:17] you have if you got Luther with this
[37:18] justification you'd have him with his
[37:20] chopped off sins but that's all you
[37:22] don't have he says what calls you to do
[37:27] what you're doing it's still there he
[37:31] said it was the old root of evil and he
[37:35] says now that goes out and
[37:37] sanctification is the old root of evil
[37:41] goes out of the individual all right but
[37:46] that leaves you to where you don't have
[37:48] the new birth all right then that
[37:54] unclean spirit has the ability if you
[37:59] don't keep him pushed away to come back
[38:02] and then dwell you again and the state
[38:07] of you is seven times work that's what
[38:09] Jesus said about the unclean spirit he
[38:16] said we're brother day or the reason I
[38:17] don't like you and the way you make
[38:19] things too complicated I'll make it too
[38:25] simple that's what makes it complicated
[38:29] because I try to make it what that
[38:31] prophet did but you're not going to go
[38:34] home and take the future home and read
[38:37] to see if the prophet said it well yet
[38:39] you're gonna set there and condemn
[38:40] everything I say or write on the
[38:42] internet you don't even have enough
[38:45] human respect so I'm gonna tell you you
[38:47] ain't born again so don't start that
[38:49] with me I don't play no games
[38:52] if you ain't interested enough in your
[38:54] soul to be able to go and check out what
[38:56] it said
[38:57] then you're not interesting your soul
[39:01] okay then we'll try to drop that part
[39:05] and leave it laying right there cuz
[39:09] that's how Stern I stand on it you see
[39:14] just because Luther taught the just
[39:16] shall live by faith that wasn't all he
[39:18] talked he had a new birth for that age
[39:26] in time Wesley had a new birth of his
[39:31] age in time
[39:33] Azusa Street new birth but none of them
[39:38] had to fight for the father why because
[39:42] it had been eating away then there was
[39:45] no restoration so I've brought the
[39:47] church up in what I've tried to bring
[39:49] you and brought you up even into higher
[39:51] depths without knowing I was going to do
[39:54] exactly what I want to do tonight then
[39:56] is to drop back in the most simplicity
[39:59] of the gospel to try to make it so
[40:04] simple if the children will listen and
[40:07] adults will listen you won't be confused
[40:10] about the new birth you will see whether
[40:15] you've been through it or whether you've
[40:18] not been through it so let's get all
[40:23] that thoughts out of our mind to whether
[40:25] or not this or that or the other and
[40:28] remember every age is the age of the
[40:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost for the
[40:34] individual of that age every age had to
[40:37] sign evidence which was to believe the
[40:41] Word of God there was preached to that
[40:44] age now what you think about it cuz see
[40:48] most of time I said we we say well
[40:51] explain a new birth well you need to be
[40:53] justified you need to be sanctified need
[40:56] to be filled with the Holy Ghost and
[41:03] you're talking to children to try to
[41:07] tell them how to be born again how can I
[41:12] twelve-year-old child understand
[41:15] justification they don't know what it is
[41:20] sanctification they don't understand the
[41:23] terminologies yet we think we've
[41:25] explained it and I'm just as guilty as
[41:29] all the other ministers thinking we've
[41:32] made it simple enough by reading what
[41:36] brother branham say it happens at
[41:40] justification the unclean knew you
[41:46] repented covered your pie sins
[41:49] sanctification and the unclean spirit
[41:52] going out and the baptism of the Holy
[41:54] Ghost
[41:54] Christ coming to live we think that
[41:57] explains that
[41:58] but does it let's drop down to not for a
[42:06] few minutes and to just think about a
[42:10] new birth they'll be tied up with all of
[42:15] the thoughts and situations you know
[42:19] just think about it
[42:23] now said a child comes up and they say I
[42:26] want to be saved
[42:27] well what you need to do you need to be
[42:29] justified you need to be sanctified need
[42:32] be filled with Holy Ghost and they're
[42:34] looking at you saying what in the world
[42:36] are you talking about would that not be
[42:47] the basics of why that most of us would
[42:50] approach him you know you can't even
[42:53] approach the door you know approach
[42:55] adults with that form until you come in
[43:01] this message you didn't know very much
[43:03] about justification did you very little
[43:07] about sanctification you know you knew
[43:12] about baptism of the Holy Ghost was I
[43:15] believe God and I got it I'm saved
[43:25] come on what happens to an individual
[43:33] then we're back here trying my best to
[43:37] stay right here tonight
[43:39] faith trying to stay with the thoughts
[43:43] of the 3,000 that heard one message and
[43:55] received the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[43:58] eternal life
[44:02] read the message they heard in the book
[44:08] of life
[44:10] radiant it's dire Peter describes what
[44:14] this is about and what that is what
[44:15] happened what took place and how the
[44:17] Lord Jesus done this and this happened
[44:18] to them and then you say what you need
[44:22] to do you need me justified now you get
[44:27] justified will get you sanctified
[44:36] what happened on the day of Pentecost to
[44:44] me the same thing had happened on to
[44:49] their Pentecost it's the same thing that
[44:52] happened to ever person this day that
[44:57] truly has the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[45:04] those people realized I'm asking you to
[45:09] return Acts they realized that these
[45:17] people had something they saw the
[45:21] evidence of it they saw them running out
[45:23] and speaking in tongues and the things
[45:24] you want to call it but we know it's all
[45:26] in the upper room but that's alright you
[45:29] can argue points and then you'll just
[45:30] miss everything I'm talking about they
[45:36] were not in the upper room they were not
[45:37] there to experience all of those things
[45:40] what they saw people that something that
[45:44] happened they didn't know everyone I
[45:48] might be in their home late make up but
[45:52] probably a lot of them knew him and they
[45:56] knew that they had fathered this man for
[46:00] three and a half years they knew that he
[46:06] was an odd person and and brought some
[46:08] hot dogs but they believed him
[46:19] he taught him the miracles and the ways
[46:21] nothing and they saw him see to those
[46:30] standing by when those people came out
[46:33] of that room they knew that a day or two
[46:37] before then they were all running for
[46:39] their lives that they were scared to
[46:42] death they were hiding right now they
[46:49] see them that they're out trying to tell
[46:53] the world what had happened in their
[46:57] lives now what are those people then
[47:04] they looked at that and they said well
[47:06] I'd like to have one what you got minute
[47:13] brother and what can we do how can we
[47:17] get what you got he's repeating every
[47:20] one haven't be baptized in the name of
[47:22] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[47:25] gift of the Holy Ghost
[47:30] repentance was required there's where
[47:36] you start do you think about
[47:40] justification I think about repentance
[47:44] and we can use the terminologies of
[47:47] justification and the things I think
[47:49] about repentance I think in the language
[47:54] these children think of
[48:02] that we heard a gospel preached we heard
[48:08] somebody talking to us
[48:10] mama daddy brother sister preacher
[48:13] teacher whatever you know what you get
[48:16] what I mean
[48:18] we heard them talking about Jesus Christ
[48:22] and that brought us to a point of what
[48:27] we call conviction into our hearts our
[48:32] thoughts that we wanted what they had
[48:43] everybody Luther ever who would have to
[48:46] first face God that way one to face him
[48:54] as a point that he brings to your
[48:57] thinking that you need to be saved
[49:02] children
[49:05] I'm not against all of these things of
[49:07] all the people of the message anyway to
[49:12] get somebody saved to me is wonderful I
[49:15] don't care if you call it standing on
[49:17] your head try to get it done as long as
[49:22] it's done I don't care if it's the devil
[49:26] preaching it as long as you get saved
[49:34] see then it starts what the new birth
[49:37] start
[49:37] you remember in the message your new
[49:39] birth starts by you believing you see
[49:44] why it's so important what you do
[49:45] believe that's vital well you start out
[49:53] believing everybody started out
[49:56] believing so men that helped along the
[49:59] way of different things but it's still
[50:01] the same thing Martin Luther had to
[50:05] realize he was lost
[50:10] and see that's what the gospel is
[50:12] supposed to bring us to a realization
[50:15] that we need to be saved in preaching
[50:20] that Jesus Christ came that's what I'm
[50:22] asking you go back and read before the
[50:24] Holy Ghost came read that in the acts 1
[50:32] 2 3 run through the read that and see
[50:36] what was explained to them that they
[50:40] were lost and doomed and they needed
[50:44] salvation and that Jesus Christ had come
[50:46] and paid the price and what you're
[50:50] seeing now is the after-effects of us
[50:54] believing it and accepting him as our
[50:57] Savior and then this story won't into
[51:03] children God will start dealing with you
[51:06] someday
[51:07] when you reach what's called the age of
[51:09] accountability and we don't determine by
[51:11] anybody in that is that is personally
[51:14] between you and God you may be 50 years
[51:18] old and finally realize that you're lost
[51:22] it's not the age factor but it's the
[51:25] point of realizing that you need to be
[51:28] saved that you need salvation the church
[51:35] I'm explaining the best that I can and
[51:38] terminology is whatever born-again
[51:40] believer goes through now if you can
[51:45] tell me shortcuts I'd like to know him
[51:47] but I've never found any you know
[51:50] shortcuts in the gospel and God don't
[51:52] have this away and then he has a better
[51:54] way over here or somebody to do it
[51:56] if he did he done wrong start with I'm
[51:58] quoting your prophet so it starts by
[52:04] realizing and he realized that starts by
[52:09] the scripture being perfect in what it
[52:11] is then no man could come to the Father
[52:17] the volume
[52:20] and no salvation outside of believing
[52:24] that Jesus Christ was Almighty God he
[52:30] see why it's so important the truth the
[52:36] Prophet said false prophets bring false
[52:38] birth these are the true prophets bring
[52:41] troopers believing on the Lord Jesus
[52:46] Christ
[52:47] are realizing see him calling you do you
[52:51] realize what that means children think
[52:56] about it
[52:57] if somebody's a preaching what it does
[53:00] you get to thinking about yourself and
[53:05] you get to thinking about well am i
[53:07] saved or no no maybe this ought to be
[53:10] for the adults also but no never you
[53:13] ought to think about it you might
[53:16] realize you hadn't been through some of
[53:17] these things you see I'm explaining the
[53:20] new bird from every form of each age and
[53:23] for all ages and my own experience
[53:28] meeting God when I was 12 years old but
[53:33] yet I could not go to him because I
[53:39] didn't know how to get there how could I
[53:43] explain to people in that church of what
[53:47] I saw when they didn't believe in the
[53:51] real God he's being real they believed
[53:56] in shouting doing this kind of they
[53:58] never had any thoughts I ain't saying
[54:00] that about everybody now trying to be
[54:02] honest where do you think they had
[54:05] thoughts about God being real enough
[54:07] that he would appear to you you realized
[54:14] that him calling you to come to him come
[54:21] in in dealing we just letting you know
[54:24] that he loves you in dealing with you in
[54:28] your heart and making you feel burr you
[54:31] know burdened because that your
[54:33] doing wrong things that you're not
[54:35] following I've to him in walking in the
[54:38] light of his love and just realizing
[54:44] that God is real why would you want to
[54:48] reap the end if he wouldn't real what is
[54:52] it repeat about if God's not real let's
[54:57] see I'm just asking you how many adults
[55:01] in here as ever went through and could
[55:04] follow that God began to deal with me
[55:09] and I repented and I asked him to come
[55:14] and cleanse me up and take away the
[55:18] things that I was doing and then to come
[55:23] to a place in your heart and life that
[55:25] you could realize that God has not just
[55:28] been dealing with you
[55:30] he has caused something to happen within
[55:34] you that is now carrying you back to him
[55:40] could you see the first you got to
[55:42] realize he's calling you
[55:44] you can't come if he ain't calling you
[55:46] no maniac off your chosen so we go
[55:50] through all of that but that ain't got
[55:51] nothing to do with it the truth of it is
[55:53] I want to believe we're all chosen don't
[55:56] you all right see repentance of our sins
[56:03] and saying God I'm sorry I'm sorry for
[56:07] that I told you as us as a sinner before
[56:12] I become to the Lord that I would do
[56:15] things wrong in life and when I come to
[56:20] the quietness in time overnight I would
[56:27] say God I'm sorry I never knew about how
[56:31] to try to talk to him as Jesus or who he
[56:34] was the second person of the Trinity or
[56:36] the third rate to the tenth I just
[56:39] believed God was real cuz I've seen him
[56:43] there was no way you could explain that
[56:46] what I saw
[56:47] is not being real and I've tried to
[56:51] preach the gospel to you children the
[56:54] same way God will speak to you if you'll
[56:59] just listen see we're going all over
[57:03] terminology but God only faced our
[57:05] prophet you see why we killed a new
[57:07] birth and in the hearts and the lives of
[57:09] the people God will speak to you and
[57:14] talk to you and he'll tell you that you
[57:21] need to be saved and this is one way
[57:25] that I know for sure of a lot of things
[57:27] I've tried to explain this to people you
[57:30] know that after you've repented of your
[57:33] sins and accepted him as your Savior
[57:37] he'll never tell you that you're lost
[57:44] you'll say you don't have enough you
[57:48] need a whole lot more but he'll never
[57:51] tell you you lost so when you turn to
[57:54] God and you start seeing God in the
[57:57] correct way and voices starts telling
[57:59] you that you're lost just say devil get
[58:03] on out of here and leave me alone
[58:05] because God ain't gonna tell because
[58:07] you're never gonna be lost if you
[58:09] repented I didn't say you're saved I
[58:12] didn't say you had eternal life I didn't
[58:14] say anything about it and I said you'll
[58:17] never face God with those sins if you
[58:23] repent enough they're putting the seal
[58:26] forgetting all this and gone yeah but
[58:30] brother Dale I don't know if I've done
[58:31] that honor you mean there's so got
[58:35] something that God can't cleanse all
[58:41] right so you repent of your sins and you
[58:45] say Father forgive me forgive me Lord
[58:52] chop
[58:53] of my past don't try to repent for what
[58:57] somebody else done I'm quoting the
[58:59] Prophet right you repent for what you've
[59:01] done now watch somebody else done he
[59:03] said don't even try to repent for what
[59:05] Adam done he said cause you didn't do it
[59:07] Adams weren't doing that Adam was one
[59:09] that needed to repent for his it's you
[59:12] and me realizing yes Lord I've done
[59:16] wrong I need salvation you Father amen
[59:23] water baptism because that's the next
[59:25] step
[59:27] you go to the water and you get baptized
[59:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[59:34] showing who you're following and what's
[59:37] taking place showing your repentance I'm
[59:40] quoting vertebra your repentance is
[59:42] genuine if you go follow him in that
[59:46] that way because the church that's the
[59:50] only thing your kids that's the only
[59:51] thing you can do and we you you can't do
[59:55] nothing but repent and then go and get
[59:57] baptized he doesn't give you a book of
[1:00:02] rules to live by that's what we've
[1:00:05] taught that has turned out to be no then
[1:00:11] you come to the second stage of your
[1:00:12] journey which is called sanctification
[1:00:16] what a sanctification means simply to
[1:00:18] you children's language what is it
[1:00:22] simple they mean to be sanctified it
[1:00:26] simply means that within your life
[1:00:30] something has happened within you that
[1:00:36] it's made you realize that you're doing
[1:00:40] wrong
[1:00:43] do you know you don't repeat it if you
[1:00:46] sin you said well I realize I wrong
[1:00:47] repented right but that never stops
[1:00:50] never think it stops anywhere in your
[1:00:52] life of you thinking about the wrong
[1:00:56] it'll never stop because it'll go with
[1:01:00] everything
[1:01:04] then you simply ask God to say Lord take
[1:01:07] away these things that I'm doing with
[1:01:10] our sanctification now sanctification is
[1:01:16] not a book of rules to live by
[1:01:21] well I've done this not done that now
[1:01:23] what else you want me to do don't worry
[1:01:28] about it
[1:01:31] just repent of your sins and follow him
[1:01:34] then you'll see something will start
[1:01:37] changing ahead and say it's born again
[1:01:40] now come on listen you see something
[1:01:43] start changing you know that the prophet
[1:01:47] of God teaches that sanctification you
[1:01:51] can even get a new nature you remember
[1:01:54] in Ezekiel you remember in Ezekiel
[1:01:59] Ezekiel covers it real well don't he
[1:02:02] I'll give you a new heart the new spirit
[1:02:05] and prophet said that's not the holy
[1:02:08] spirit he said something new spirit the
[1:02:12] repentance cleanses you sanctification
[1:02:14] brings you new desires new thoughts you
[1:02:20] start wanting to go to church and many
[1:02:23] of you have noticed and children listen
[1:02:25] how many of you have noticed adults that
[1:02:29] start out doing real good and they start
[1:02:31] going to church and doing that the night
[1:02:33] a while you see them gradually falling
[1:02:35] off and they get where they don't come
[1:02:39] they don't want to serve the Lord come
[1:02:42] on children and if he wants to happen
[1:02:46] how bad it is for us adults who do those
[1:02:50] things it takes to it
[1:02:55] it's the sanctification that's where
[1:02:58] Jesus said the unclean spirit goes out
[1:03:00] of a man
[1:03:02] brother Brown says you get new desires
[1:03:04] new thoughts you want to go to church
[1:03:06] you want to do right you want to repent
[1:03:08] of your sins you want to live right
[1:03:14] that's sanctification
[1:03:17] that's where most people stop it and
[1:03:20] think that is the new birth but that's
[1:03:21] not what it is sanctification is just
[1:03:26] picking up you've heard the Prophet talk
[1:03:28] about you see AG lice out in the yard
[1:03:29] you pick it up as justification you got
[1:03:33] a reason for it
[1:03:34] you don't take it fill it full of water
[1:03:36] and start drinking you take it in the
[1:03:38] house and you wash it then you boil it
[1:03:41] you cleanse it a sanctification C then
[1:03:47] you can put something in it and you
[1:03:49] drink it see children you start
[1:03:52] realizing and I shouldn't do these
[1:03:56] things I shouldn't have these wrong
[1:03:59] thoughts
[1:04:00] I shouldn't say these things the come on
[1:04:05] children we even put it down in a
[1:04:07] natural way you realize what I'm talking
[1:04:10] about
[1:04:11] you reached an age about 10 11 12 years
[1:04:14] old you think the whole world can't run
[1:04:16] without you and you think mom and daddys
[1:04:21] the craziest people that there is in the
[1:04:23] world that one over in the corner
[1:04:26] shaking is there you begin to think look
[1:04:34] what I've done I've quit this I quit
[1:04:37] down I stop these things I don't do
[1:04:40] these so I must be saved don't stop
[1:04:45] don't stop there that's just that
[1:04:49] unclean spirit going out now if the
[1:04:51] unclean spirit goes out what are we
[1:04:54] supposed to do we're supposed to put
[1:04:56] something in place off now what can you
[1:04:59] put in place of don't don't try to talk
[1:05:03] about putting the baptism the whole goes
[1:05:05] there yet we got that far you start
[1:05:07] putting the word really you want plain
[1:05:12] language you know what drives the
[1:05:14] unclean spirit out of you is the words
[1:05:18] you've taken inhaled it's being the
[1:05:21] truth how well I remember those years
[1:05:27] that I walked in a place 18 years of age
[1:05:33] I went to the altar of Baptist Church of
[1:05:36] course we got everything we believed was
[1:05:37] safe I knew there's something wrong I
[1:05:41] couldn't get an answer because they
[1:05:44] didn't know my ass my questions
[1:05:46] I was so dedicated to God you know I've
[1:05:52] done everything I could do you see it
[1:05:56] here now I mean you need to vacuum floor
[1:05:59] I'll do it I don't worry about it clean
[1:06:01] the bathtub I mean in the bathrooms I
[1:06:03] don't care
[1:06:05] well I was so dedicated from the time I
[1:06:08] was 18 years old to the church at 23
[1:06:12] years old I was ordained a deacon wound
[1:06:17] up teaching the adult classes which was
[1:06:21] the Deacons and elders and their wives
[1:06:25] because I had that zeal see don't let
[1:06:33] that seal eat you up they lead up your
[1:06:35] wisdom the scripture says wait on God I
[1:06:41] had no one to be able to help me to go
[1:06:44] any further because they knew no father
[1:06:51] do they would have been glad to put me
[1:06:53] in preaching or anything but I'm just
[1:06:59] trying to tell you own personal
[1:07:02] experience
[1:07:06] we don't go hard to do things you
[1:07:11] repented of your sins
[1:07:13] you've asked him to forgive you you've
[1:07:16] asked him to cleanse you up there's
[1:07:19] you've great words we use sanctification
[1:07:21] or some you know this you don't it
[1:07:23] simply means just cleaning you up you
[1:07:26] stop thinking the wrong thoughts
[1:07:28] something starts happening within you
[1:07:32] why because the unclean has gone out and
[1:07:37] God is trying his best to come
[1:07:40] in and he's coming in by the word that
[1:07:44] you're hearing the words you hearing is
[1:07:50] what's driving him out and the words
[1:07:52] you're hearing is what's keeping him
[1:07:54] driven out but you know yourself your
[1:08:00] prophet when he told her noted ones to
[1:08:02] the adults when he got into anointed
[1:08:04] ones what to do those people that come
[1:08:07] to sanctification were perfect examples
[1:08:11] for the anointed ones because they said
[1:08:17] we've done this we've done that we've
[1:08:19] done over we've done everything but why
[1:08:21] didn't they get born again they got
[1:08:24] enough to get an anointing but not
[1:08:26] enough to get a birth now I'm simply
[1:08:30] trying to explain one time what is the
[1:08:33] new birth the new birth is the birth of
[1:08:36] the word you take the word and you hold
[1:08:39] it and then the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:08:42] and quickens it now is that right in the
[1:08:44] Gospels there's three things the
[1:08:46] disciple drove one of them said
[1:08:47] understand it one of them kept it I
[1:08:49] believe it's the word and in Oh Joe held
[1:08:53] it it's like three things that he's
[1:08:56] explaining in the parables how that
[1:08:58] those disciples in those parables of the
[1:09:00] the you know the word being planted the
[1:09:05] the things happening the kingdom the
[1:09:07] children of the kingdom and thought and
[1:09:08] look at those disciples three and a half
[1:09:11] years three nine years they listened to
[1:09:21] the Lord Jesus talking about the word
[1:09:25] and what was happening all that time
[1:09:32] what was happening all that time that
[1:09:37] unclean spirit was being driven out they
[1:09:44] were taking God at His Word
[1:09:45] until the scripture says finally he said
[1:09:47] do you not believe they said we believe
[1:09:51] that thou hast the words of eternal we
[1:09:53] believe the ain't no horse to
[1:09:54] they had got to a place that they
[1:09:56] believed but they were only sanctified
[1:10:01] I'm saying that to the children don't
[1:10:04] get so caught up with it that you think
[1:10:05] I done this and done that that I've got
[1:10:07] it always see God there's not a day in
[1:10:12] my life that I don't pray God save me
[1:10:21] you don't pray for God to save you know
[1:10:24] I've already said why would you not cry
[1:10:31] out to be saved what I've already saved
[1:10:35] I say nice things don't worry about it
[1:10:39] you got that thought you ain't saved no
[1:10:43] come on adults don't try to fight me
[1:10:48] with words and thoughts listen why would
[1:10:54] you not call out to God
[1:10:56] god save me God deliver me this man that
[1:11:02] I live within he's not a view yet you
[1:11:10] know this one that's inside of me is you
[1:11:12] but the one outside through my body my
[1:11:14] spirit it's not of you now have turmoil
[1:11:18] I have Fighting's and things if you
[1:11:22] don't believe that go to power where he
[1:11:24] said things that would not I do think I
[1:11:25] do it would not be said if it's not that
[1:11:27] he said it's not me that do it he says
[1:11:29] that one is with this within the he's
[1:11:31] ones holding with this outside man he
[1:11:34] serves the law of the flesh
[1:11:35] now I'm paraphrasing the scripture but
[1:11:37] is right the children listen never stop
[1:11:43] seeking God adults never stop seeking
[1:11:48] God never stopped crying out unto Him
[1:11:53] never stop telling him it's you loving
[1:11:57] ain't a prayer that I make that I don't
[1:12:00] say Lord I love you I've been ridiculed
[1:12:05] for putting my hands up
[1:12:08] we're saying I love you and I told God
[1:12:12] every time I raised my hand I want you
[1:12:14] to know Lord then I love you people say
[1:12:18] oh that's the other thing there's other
[1:12:20] signs but are you going to tell me that
[1:12:23] that's not the International world-known
[1:12:26] language of I love you we're each way
[1:12:30] you started whatever you want to go it
[1:12:33] means I love you you telling me to all
[1:12:38] them people that hold our hand up like
[1:12:39] that oh that's really the devil cuz it
[1:12:41] but I'll tell you just like I told the
[1:12:45] brother that Minister brother they said
[1:12:47] something to me about it he said they're
[1:12:49] seeing you out on the Internet I said
[1:12:51] what about when they see you and you do
[1:12:52] that he said what do you mean I said
[1:12:55] that's the Pope's conquering piece he's
[1:12:58] conquering and I said you do it every
[1:13:01] time you preach well he draw that and he
[1:13:05] never mentioned that again well I didn't
[1:13:09] want to tell him that way but that's
[1:13:10] where it was he's standing right here in
[1:13:11] breach and he go and that's what that
[1:13:14] Pope is saying I'm dividing even
[1:13:16] conquering you I'm taking over the land
[1:13:22] as you say children have you accepted
[1:13:27] Jesus Christ as your Savior have you
[1:13:33] asked him to cleanse you and forgive you
[1:13:36] do you ask him daily to forgive you of
[1:13:39] the things you do have you asked him to
[1:13:43] come and live in your heart because
[1:13:45] remember the Prophet said it's not
[1:13:50] whether or not you accept him he said
[1:13:55] it's whether or not he accepts you and
[1:14:00] you know what he's not going to accept
[1:14:02] you if you're not seeing your wine
[1:14:03] that's sensible
[1:14:05] well I've accepted Jesus Christ my
[1:14:07] Savior as he accepted you well what do
[1:14:11] you mean that's all I can do
[1:14:13] amen all Abraham could do was believe
[1:14:19] God hey man
[1:14:21] but what did God do for Abraham he
[1:14:24] circumcised him come on have you
[1:14:31] accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior
[1:14:33] said Lord saved me now Lord cleanse me
[1:14:36] and let me listen to the word instead of
[1:14:40] listening to all this other garbage on
[1:14:42] the tapes and your doings and their
[1:14:44] thing have you listened to God in His
[1:14:47] Word remember the way you raise those
[1:14:51] children folks is the way they shall be
[1:15:01] but has he accepted you well what do you
[1:15:06] mean I quit this and I quit that I
[1:15:10] repented and I quit doing this time and
[1:15:12] I'd love to go to church and I love the
[1:15:15] Lord and his word that's ever been at
[1:15:17] the word sanctification you didn't
[1:15:20] receive the new birth yet because the
[1:15:23] new birth you how something now listen
[1:15:27] carefully adults to you have something
[1:15:30] to do with justification because you've
[1:15:35] repented of your sins you have something
[1:15:38] to do with sanctification because you
[1:15:41] have took the word and held it and held
[1:15:44] on to that word and let that word
[1:15:46] cleanse you from the things of cutting
[1:15:49] your hair painting your face wearing
[1:15:50] your pants or men wearing longer exactly
[1:15:52] whatever doing but has he ever accepted
[1:16:00] you
[1:16:05] what do you mean brother day when he
[1:16:07] gives you the baptism when the Holy
[1:16:09] Ghost is when he accepts you are you
[1:16:13] listening when he gives you the baptism
[1:16:17] of the Holy Spirit that is him accepting
[1:16:22] you that is him prior phrasing that
[1:16:27] would using it like the Lord Jesus
[1:16:29] pleased to dwell when he gave you the
[1:16:35] new birth he's pleased to dwell in you
[1:16:40] well brother how do I know I got the new
[1:16:42] birth watch the word from then on and
[1:16:46] see which you took out of my thoughts
[1:16:54] because you've covered sanctification as
[1:16:59] being where we get new thoughts and new
[1:17:01] ideas and you what do we get it to new
[1:17:04] birth we get the person listen we hit
[1:17:09] something inside that can tell us what's
[1:17:12] outside and tell us what from inside of
[1:17:17] us coming outside needs to get out right
[1:17:23] is any better way of explaining new
[1:17:26] birth and that he comes to live inside
[1:17:28] of you and give you eternal life in your
[1:17:31] soul and then surely you got something
[1:17:35] on your side to fight the battle you got
[1:17:40] somebody to help you then it's not just
[1:17:45] quitting there some quitting that it's
[1:17:49] whether or not Jesus Christ has come and
[1:17:51] lived in your life it's whether or not
[1:17:56] he has accepted you he's accepted you
[1:18:03] you give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:05] Ghost
[1:18:07] and then he'll never turn you down you
[1:18:12] remember that scripture or there's an
[1:18:13] Old Testament blessed is either I don't
[1:18:16] know
[1:18:18] and prove is not seeing David you know
[1:18:23] you realize there's a person that God
[1:18:25] doesn't impute sin to no that's not cuz
[1:18:28] I so good first off
[1:18:32] God don't impute where you hold your
[1:18:34] sins and won't repent all right
[1:18:38] I mean impute and righteousness to you
[1:18:41] at that time
[1:18:42] you don't impute that sanctification in
[1:18:45] the basis of trying to do this right
[1:18:47] when you receive the baptism when the
[1:18:49] Holy Ghost I can find this with the
[1:18:51] Prophet only the one who has the new
[1:18:54] birth can fit David and what he said
[1:18:59] only the person who has the new birth
[1:19:01] the born-again experience the eternal I
[1:19:04] can fit what David said unless it is a
[1:19:07] man to whom God will not impute sin
[1:19:08] brother Branham said he will not impute
[1:19:12] sin over the token so if you want to get
[1:19:18] to the place where sin is not imputed
[1:19:19] until you get born again you're born
[1:19:24] again because that's the person he's
[1:19:27] talking about he won't impute e impute
[1:19:31] to all the rest god he keeps records but
[1:19:34] when you get that new birth now remember
[1:19:37] now here's where we go you say well you
[1:19:40] mean to tell me when we get the new
[1:19:41] birth we can just go out and start doing
[1:19:43] wrong now you're not listening we
[1:19:45] covered that at sanctification
[1:19:50] sanctification was supposed to took away
[1:19:53] all them wrong desires sanctification
[1:20:00] are you going to ever get to the basis
[1:20:02] brother Dale that you don't have no
[1:20:04] wrong thoughts ain't never said I would
[1:20:07] they never thought I would and I'll
[1:20:09] quote your prophet he said we'll be a
[1:20:11] sticker too we were challenged well I
[1:20:13] it don't matter about me being a sticker
[1:20:16] now he didn't say that he said you won't
[1:20:20] be a sticker when you've met when you're
[1:20:23] changed until then you're a human being
[1:20:25] that is a body and a spirit that is
[1:20:29] still of this worldly night
[1:20:30] with that soul inside of there there's
[1:20:36] the only thing that don't see the man
[1:20:40] that don't see there's one God don't
[1:20:41] impute what have you done wrong do it
[1:20:46] every day you know quotes your prophet
[1:20:49] but random do you see any said over day
[1:20:53] is that right he said I seen every day
[1:20:59] what cause it was human Paul you seen
[1:21:03] things I would not I do not the things I
[1:21:06] do not it would not he said then if I do
[1:21:08] these things it's not neither do it with
[1:21:10] this outside man he said he's gonna
[1:21:12] serve the law of the flesh and he said
[1:21:14] I've served the inward man which is from
[1:21:16] Christ
[1:21:16] that's perforation but that's Paul what
[1:21:19] is it Romans you realize Church then the
[1:21:29] young people listen to me for men and
[1:21:30] adults don't get so peed off hot at me
[1:21:33] as to me try to help your children do
[1:21:39] you
[1:21:39] I believe in emotional things there's
[1:21:43] not an emotional person in this building
[1:21:45] as emotional as this person is but you
[1:21:49] never know it never see it because it's
[1:21:53] something within me we're talking today
[1:21:56] about it we pray at night before we go
[1:21:59] to bed nice thing we prayed I get up
[1:22:03] crawl over cross the bed kids my wife
[1:22:06] cannot say I love you I don't in my
[1:22:11] prayin the reason I can go to sleep in
[1:22:17] the hurry is when I was turned back over
[1:22:19] I start talking to it
[1:22:28] I started praying the Bible says pray
[1:22:33] without ceasing and how can you do that
[1:22:36] it just means you just taking an
[1:22:38] attitude of priorities right you stay in
[1:22:41] an attitude of prayer you can go all day
[1:22:44] long and you ain't bowed your head and
[1:22:46] you ain't said amen
[1:22:49] you simply been talking to God I thought
[1:22:57] I had to get down pray do brother random
[1:22:59] thoughts I'm fine
[1:23:00] do I need to do it this way do it that
[1:23:03] way didn't you know he was like he said
[1:23:04] about his hands or someone yeah it's
[1:23:08] just believing in God is real see if you
[1:23:12] don't believe God is real then you can't
[1:23:14] realize that that God is talking to you
[1:23:16] and you'll think it's just mama condemn
[1:23:19] me for doing this her daddy told me is
[1:23:22] wrong to do this and I don't want to do
[1:23:24] it children that's wonderful that's
[1:23:26] father and mother of leadership that's
[1:23:29] wonderful that's you following them less
[1:23:32] children that's wonderful
[1:23:34] that's commendable but that's not
[1:23:37] salvation salvation is not cause you
[1:23:43] cried shouted but it's win you cried and
[1:23:48] shouted because of what happened in your
[1:23:52] life when you begin to realize there's
[1:23:59] something different you begin to realize
[1:24:02] that something happened with inside of
[1:24:04] me it's not just in my body in my spirit
[1:24:08] but something in my very nature in being
[1:24:11] is crying out for God salvation the same
[1:24:21] forever age now listen if you listened
[1:24:26] with that approach I'm talking about
[1:24:30] what I've said
[1:24:31] not the wordings I've used and the
[1:24:33] thoughts go that I'm saying with the
[1:24:35] approach that I've tried to make that
[1:24:38] way would show the new birth is for
[1:24:41] everybody
[1:24:41] the sign that's what I've tried to do to
[1:24:46] show you the new birth is for everybody
[1:24:48] the same whether it be children whether
[1:24:50] it be adults whether it be grandmas and
[1:24:54] grandpas or who it is salvations are
[1:24:59] saying gods I'm repeating it so give God
[1:25:04] calling you and speaking to you calling
[1:25:10] you to himself and you realizing God is
[1:25:15] real and no something's talking to you
[1:25:18] then you say to simply the God you don't
[1:25:20] want to tell everybody the world about
[1:25:21] you just simply say to God Lord I love
[1:25:25] you save me Lord I need for you to come
[1:25:31] down and save me accept me is your child
[1:25:37] I take away the MOL desires and I listen
[1:25:42] children you can listen to these old
[1:25:46] folks talk all you want and they'll tell
[1:25:49] you how they had no problems that
[1:25:52] they've been a Christian 50 years and
[1:25:54] they ain't had no troubles and ain't had
[1:25:56] no heartaches and no problems now you're
[1:26:00] not doing it but they're lying to the
[1:26:04] that's dishonest I can make it don't
[1:26:07] call them liars okay but they're not
[1:26:10] telling you the truth because brother
[1:26:12] branham emphatic that's what I call one
[1:26:15] thing that a man in the great position
[1:26:17] he was in the yet he was so humble and
[1:26:19] so repented and so to God that he loved
[1:26:27] God brother Perry Greene told it one
[1:26:30] time down in Atlanta believe what he
[1:26:32] said brother Branham told him said
[1:26:33] brother Perry said when you get in touch
[1:26:37] with him talking to it he said you tell
[1:26:40] him I love him he wanted God to know he
[1:26:45] loved him you ever seen a man that was
[1:26:49] built the way he was built ain't none of
[1:26:52] us know neither trying lingo me
[1:26:54] not yet you know what we can strive for
[1:26:58] it
[1:26:59] does that mean we throw up our hands and
[1:27:01] quit no we strive for it we seek after
[1:27:05] God and try to find him we try to teach
[1:27:09] our children and that's why it's so
[1:27:13] important for you to teach your children
[1:27:17] teach them at home to pray and to serve
[1:27:22] God but listen church if I'm wrong I'm
[1:27:27] sorry but don't scare your children with
[1:27:31] the gospel now this is mom and daddy I'm
[1:27:35] talking to for me don't try to scare
[1:27:37] your children into being safe you'll run
[1:27:39] them away from God don't try to scare
[1:27:43] them
[1:27:43] don't tell them God don't want you do
[1:27:45] that don't you tell them I don't want
[1:27:49] you to you ain't man enough or woman
[1:27:52] enough to say it I don't want you to do
[1:27:53] that because I didn't live in a good
[1:27:54] life see you're saying God don't want
[1:27:58] you you're making them afraid of God
[1:28:02] you're making a fear come upon them
[1:28:06] you don't realize it you're going the
[1:28:09] opposite direction live before them the
[1:28:14] example of Christ and say lord help the
[1:28:20] children what a wonderful thing it is to
[1:28:27] know the truth because now listen what
[1:28:29] I'm saying
[1:28:29] you can argue in fuss all you want to
[1:28:32] but to know a simple form of salvation
[1:28:38] that would save everybody in the world
[1:28:41] and that's not a hard thing to do
[1:28:43] nothing I've explained tonight would be
[1:28:46] something hard for you to do all I ask
[1:28:49] you to do is realize you're lost repent
[1:28:55] of your sins and ask God to forgive you
[1:28:57] follow him in water baptism start going
[1:29:01] to church and being good reading your
[1:29:02] Bible the prophets message studying it
[1:29:05] letting that come in to you and
[1:29:07] cleanse you I walked in that after
[1:29:11] coming in this message for two years do
[1:29:20] I claim salvation I was 18 years old
[1:29:22] I've seen a lot of things happening of
[1:29:24] God but when I heard that prophet
[1:29:27] explaining the new birth I knew I didn't
[1:29:29] have it and I began to seek Him and say
[1:29:35] Lord what is it he was guiding me to
[1:29:41] himself through the opening of the word
[1:29:44] and he'll do that if you'll just keep
[1:29:47] reading and praying but then he'll come
[1:29:54] one day and he'll accept you and when he
[1:29:57] does you'll know where you're at
[1:30:02] musicians you'll know where you're at
[1:30:04] and where you standing you'll see this
[1:30:08] thing starts happening it's a whole lot
[1:30:10] different don't expect it to be
[1:30:15] something like we've tried to explain to
[1:30:17] you where brother Allen said to the new
[1:30:21] birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:30:23] well what I need to read read the
[1:30:25] message read the Bible listen to
[1:30:28] everything you can yes but I can't give
[1:30:32] you a certain book to read what you need
[1:30:35] to do you need to get into please ask
[1:30:36] these and read the whole thing and
[1:30:38] you'll find out you saved know you might
[1:30:40] find out you're lost that's right you
[1:30:44] might wind up and find out you're lost
[1:30:46] pray out to God and to seek Him cause
[1:30:54] when he accepts you you let you know it
[1:30:57] well I speak in tongues and cria
[1:31:00] whatever God wants you to do whatever he
[1:31:04] wants you to do your doing brother Ron
[1:31:06] said everybody's not natured to sign
[1:31:14] he said if you've never spoke in tongues
[1:31:16] listen if I can quote this he said if
[1:31:19] you've never spoke in tongue he said lay
[1:31:21] before the spout long enough and God let
[1:31:24] you come through speaking something to
[1:31:26] that that's pretty close because you see
[1:31:30] he explained it like there some people
[1:31:33] have to have things to hold onto right
[1:31:39] some people have to have something to
[1:31:41] hold onto some people can just take it
[1:31:45] like it is and stand by the some has to
[1:31:49] have things to hold them to you know
[1:31:52] what he's a good card
[1:31:53] he'll do that let's stand together see
