========================================

not showing him you got start back all over all over I'm sorry I'm already 15 minutes in no it just did yeah it hadn't go ahead now um so Reuben represents he's he's the man if you remember the four Beast the position of them around the AR Reuben's on the bottom a good kind of trick to remember the positions the Eagles up top right North and the uh Lion on the East and the lion starts goes around like this lion o man eag right um so Reuben um what Reuben the one that tried to save his brother he the one yeah he tried Toph that shows first born and that little more knowledge the rest of well he that come from my mother yeah I agree with that hey man uh and I have a quote about what brother Brandon said about first one it don't matter we got quote there no he said in Revelation 4 1961 he said now Reuben was the man he was the first one y the weakest one of the bunch yep didn't Jacob say so in Genesis 49 Ruben Thou Art the first of my strength now think about this in context of of the just man's strength there no there's no strength in us we have to take our strength from God Ruben thou are the first of my strength but like water you went up on my couch and defile my couch and live with his father's concubine see that's the immorals of the human being you see the animal don't have the memorials the lion none of these things has that but the man does ruin the next man's wife and so forth just like the same the same thing everything's completed now this down here this Dan was an equal and this Reuben was the man's face so then we get to Simeon and Levi Simeon and Levi are Brethren instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul come not thou into their secret under their assembly my honor be not be th not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self will they dig down a wall now he's talking about the story in Genesis 34 um each of the each of these prophecies has uh many different directions you can go you can so part of this is um uh story of Simon and Levi how they slew hamor and shik after they circumcised him because they uh one of them U had had a crush on Dina and uh I'm not going to read all that and then uh so so he prophesied that they were going to be part of the part of his prophecy was they were going to be divided and Scattered in Israel and this is speaking of um in Joshua 19 Simon's inheritance was actually part and pieces of judah's inheritance he got just part scattered around and Levi receiv received because uh they they received the priesthood not any particular territory they uh levied 48 cities scattered throughout the other tribes and this is I believe this is also speaking of um Israel's rejection of Christ uh ended up they scattered around the world and it resulted in the 10 lost tribes of Israel um Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's will from the Jud is a lion's will from the pray my son thou are gone up he stoop down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall Rous him up now this is there's a there's a speaking of the qualities of Christ and speaking of the quality of Judah as well so this is speaking of Christ's death he washed in Isaiah he washed in garments and wine his clothes in the blood of grapes the cross and um in Isaiah 63 he said who is this that Cometh From Edom with Dy garments from bosra wherefore art thou read and thine of heral thy garments like him that treadeth in wine fat and uh so so judah's prophec see pictures our Lord's kingship because Judah got the scepter so the scepter the Messiah is going to come from Judah and then uh let's see next zebulun verse 13 zebulun shall dwell at the Haven of the sea and he shall be for a Haven of ships and his borders shall be inion zidon Zulan is interesting because um first of all because he's not next in the lineage of all if you look at the genealogy zebulin is the 10th and uh Judah is the fourth so Jacob jumps in his Blessing from the fourth child to the 10th child so Christ was actually born part of Judah but zebulun is where he lived cuz zeul in uh I think this is Moses prophecy I didn't write the book down zebulin shall dwell at the Haven of the sea and he shall be for a Haven of ships and his bord shall be unto zidon that's uh where Galilee part of Galilee was in Zebulon and Moses prophesied of zebulun and of zebulin he said rejoice zebulin in thy going out and isar and thy tent they shall call the people into the mountains so there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the abundance of the Seas and of treasures hid in the sayand so zebulin Judah is his kingship kind of picture Zebula as uh Christ is our Haven our refuge and our Haven of Rest because it was where God uh when he was on Earth U let's see he would he would kind of zeel was kind of treated as his resting place it was where uh zebulin Galilee was where Mary and Joseph returned from Egypt and um when John had heard that when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee now let's move on to isachar moving a little bit fast isar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute so this is kind of presenting c isachar as a servant and as a servant and it's car this is interesting his car and was I was reading on this um Hebrew website that just kind of listed out some views of different rabbis and things this car has traditionally been taugh of thought of as a out of is car came all the religious teachers and they kind of had a symbiotic relationship with zebulun so zebulun was a bunch of merchants and they would make all the money money so that his car could study and they even today they uh when you ever hear the phrase is car in zeul you kind of it means that that kind of relationship where one provides the income and the other provide does the study got kind of relationship like that um so is AAR the servant u in numbers 26 only Judah and Dan had more men and Dan only had 100 more and uh and uh 1 Chronicles 1232 it even speaks of thear being U men of understanding it says of the children of isar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do the heads of them were 200 and all their Brethren were at their commandment so it said isachar was men were men that had understanding of the times and then Dan Dan the judge so Dan presenting Dan as a judge but also Christ is our judge Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel Dan shall be a serpent by the way and adder in the path that bth the horse's heals so that his riter shall fall backward I have waited for thy salvation oh Lord now Dan is really interesting because um in Genesis uh you don't have to turn there but Genesis 46:23 and in all the places where the tribe the sons of the different tribes are listed Dan sons are never listed Dan sons in Genesis 46:23 instead of listing his sons it just lists like their tribal name hushen and in numbers 26:42 instead of listing Dan Sons it just list Shu because Dan's Earthly land was was blotted out in cases where Dan is listed with the other tribes Dan is often far down or even last and Dan was the last tribe to receive an inheritance by Joshua and numbers 10:25 and the standard of the camp of the children of set forward which was the re reward of all the camps throughout their host and over his host was AER so ad Dan went last and when the children of Israel were moving through uh the Israel and it's it's telling that after Jacob makes his Blessing to Dan he says he finishes what with I have waited for thy salvation oh Lord almost done then g a troop shall overcoming but he shall be overcome with the last this is speaking of Christ's resurrection and Asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yeld Royal danies he's the bread of life and Gad wanted to land on the east side of Jordan before uh let's see Gad uh when the when Joshua was partitioning out the land Gad wanted to land on the east side of Jordan before Canan was divided among the 12 tribes so he kind of jumped the gun and said I'll take this I don't want to cross St Jordan I'll just take this over this and because of that he had to fight the rest of his the rest of the time they were in the in Israel in the land said the way they have Fellowship 19 5 look when Israel was dividing up their lands there I was I believe it was gab was one of them and perhaps the half tribe they didn't go over into the promised land they stayed on this side borderline and then napali naftali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words and naali is the cities of the cities of capernium Betha tzin uh the cities where a lot of the things that Jesus did were done were done in naali so he prophesied about giving goodly words and then uh Joseph represents Christ Joseph is a fruitful bow um he promised fruitfulness the double blessing the blessing of a multitude of Nations um in ezekiel's Millennial prophecy Ezekiel 47 Joseph has allocated two portions a double portion and Joseph was a shepherd of Israel just as Jesus is and Benjamin now this is the one I mentioned earlier about Benjamin being a um a strange this this a blessing verse 27 a strange blessing for one that was the apple of of his father's eye Benjamin shall Raven as a wolf in the morning he shall Devour the prey and at night he shall divide the SP and this depicts Christ as a terrible Warrior our our defense and uh all down through history the heroes of this tribe were marked by their f for fierceness and they're willing to go to battle ahood and King s igland that's one my favorite bible stories to tell the kids about stuck his sword in the big fat king igland and eud and King Saul were both of this tribe and and Paul Saul of Tarsus was of this tribe and uh so if you kind of look back down through all the different tribes that they all look forward to Christ Reuben his prophecy was speaking of the he said the Excellence and dignity of Christ person he's the firstborn the excellent Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power seon and Levi speak of of the of the sacrifice on the cross and the dispersement of Israel the prophesy of of Judah the Lord's kingship zebulun The Refuge and Haven of Rest disar his service Dan a judge Gad his resurrection the Asher the bread of life and naali um goodly words the uh prophecy of Joseph is a millennial Reign and Benjamin is our terrible Warrior and our defense and uh let's stop there good job
