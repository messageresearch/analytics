TRANSCRIPT
========================================
after you female thank you all right I've got slim Biggins the neighbor nicely bit hidden in binoculars what we're slammed but I'm giving you the most vision washed up oh yeah absolutely all right so now we have talked last week about the fifth seal we actually went through a review which oh I believe helton help people more than then we were I think I'll do that I'll go just a little way and we'll buy guzzle yeah and just kind of catch up everybody you know very much yes way it was two several others that make that comment about itself but I want you to get what I was trying to tell you last Sunday and get the essence of the field and I promise you one thing brother brother Bob he's not here today but brother Bob got online and he's kind of talking to somebody in and he's talking about the seal being for redemption and boy if you're not really tall then you know really is people don't see that because they haven't been taught they think it's the revealing of the Antichrist which it is but I thought the Prophet said there was a seventh seal above the redemption okay the Book of Revelations filed was the sealed book that the lamb took out of the hand of the one sitting on the throne and in Revelation 10 7 that book was open and he delivered it to the seventh angel to deliver to you and I which is a seven filled with the redemption not a sentence you look about the devil and you'll understand that because remember the property God says the what was the thunder the thunder whoever I think is so experienced but the thunders is the revelations contained in the seal all right so that's what we're doing here this is to me you say what you want but this is the thunder that route that that ad spoke out through the seals to tell us true and I don't want to say the real revelation because this is a revelation to the anti-skid but knowing who the Antichrist is and all of this tactic that's good but how I'm not going to change your body knuckle change your body is not resent you can't redeem the devil okay so so the mystery brother ended with the mystery contained in the seven seals the world around broke the Seventh Seal which was those seven day or eight days in jeffersonville in 1963 but if the revelations contained in those seven fields which are the Thunder are the voice of God when the seal breaks that's telling you and I was going over right now so if you want to watch the Thunder garden you've been hearing for the past month two months and actually 25 or 30 years all right so we're very fortunate my brother Bob said I'd forgotten speaking to that individual he he thanked God that he was living there teaching under their teaching ministry because if not he would be just like the brother but when you mean this is her attention what do you mean what do you do the God was just totally nuts a lost but he was totally ignorant of and that's my whole pretense listen if the seal broke in 1963 now it did as a prophet but now what would everybody around them everybody around him thought and even himself thought it would the end I thought it was going to be over that when he even did it going to be killed right memory stop don't turn what it is from either I'm going to be killed or it's a further part of my ministry will Wendy started preaching Oh sealed they fill up to the cell still thinking that the rapture was going to take place on that Sunday when he preached to sell affiliate and it's been 60 years since then thankfully been 53 73 83 93 2003 2013 amen let's get on his bed yeah in 54 years almost 55 years that we probe that this message and brother Brown says what the greatest message you that were great so not to throw all of them out but to keep all of them right underneath that we see that it has to have like the onion field it's got a layer there's got another layer underneath that and then and then it's going to layer underneath that because if its justification baby form and then there's another level of justification and then there's another level duplicate something got opened up under those seals because they say brother I need to write when third chapter revelations or he said these thunders would be outside the Bible he said no no you can't add one word can take one chord out so what is it what here's the book what is the Bible now in tablet form what is about if the seven sealed book of retention not the seven sealed book of the revelation of the devil I'm sorry but that you see how though that people are blinded by Paul Shepherds or have not had teaching that would at least thus osterlich steer steer you in pride direction after you up three other series you've been stirring steered then you can see that remember the Bible is written what is written on the surface as a commentary of history well I said on the service your first layer is a commentary of history from the garden to the future on a commentary you can how many people most of the stuff we get from civilization and stuff like that comes from the Bible all of our laws of the race according works supposed to be at the first very important to ten commandments all of our judgments are according to them the Old Testament so it's a comic book of culture that man had lived by Emma going what the Christian and even though maybe didn't understand everything was going off right then there's another layer underneath that this brother grams of the Bible written to Christian right we get our food from that we get our energy ancestor it's our source of life past the email I all right because it has a what has it has a natural implication then has a spiritual implication and then to me it has a supernatural implication that this very word that we're reading right here is eternal it was only pen so that you and I could read it and put it above because before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain the Bible was never just written it was already here but what was it was in the mind of God that he had to what bring it down let somebody naturally will go remember all this is about a natural people that live to serve right natural names of people that live on this earth is part of this tria history is not without pleasures and people cuz you know what I want you to do me a favor go and find me a book of a civilization and history find me a history book on a bookmark I mean I'm just way more well you can Y go to nobody enough day because there's no there's nobody to write about there there's no history so you see I just got that thing but you really don't find a book on the history of March you can find a commentary that we wrote about what we see a large but but it is on the earth the only way you can write a book is help somebody here but your hook I can read you like a book you're reading epistle you wrote the Bible that's what I'm telling your wind you know this part of this Bible that you you wrote it whether you believe that or not because the attributes that come from God I never moved and what forms you is the attribute it was written here the like oh they'll tell you last night I mean if we have angel we are predestinated obviously by for knowledge but we are predestined then we have a predetermined journey that we take but it was predetermined by what I saw we would do and the angels cannot find our thinking last night the angel without angel defender brother ground them never gave him a real legend he would give him a suggestion it written in the scripture where it says that you'll read all the things that the angel because the angel just couldn't come out and give you a revelation why revelation has to come human sure they're sparks is that the angel know that there's one thing for sure the angel don't know one thing about redemption right yeah you don't leave out reduction so that's something they don't know that you and the human being because you became a human and you were regenerated you can that's why we will judge the angle think about that that's good food talk so this is the college grade but then there is a what to understand rocket for a history book why would we need to judge angels they never see because they were late so I got to be somewhere for they some of them fell they gotta be aware some of them I don't know what you say make mistakes but I just a lot of what the Bible says the overcome my mom study last night reason grant good time about today that we good we're talking about the very same thing and what about this was your game well we'll judge the Angels that was supposed to help this person or suppose judge those angel and I don't know it's not going to be a part of because one thing's for sure the one we went with the devil they're going to be dogging my god they're going to be killed those spirits are going to be gone they're going to deal them the more they just I felt like by painting the life failure okay but the Bible says we will change and so that's what we will do negative come on your good ever they're back whatever does one way or the other that's correct or not yes that's right that's what Darren I was talking about last night because Ryan let me say this come at your mom about judgment I know we'll be we'll get off this from head but but we'll get back once in a minute but he says don't judge you need to tell your mother she's judged every day she can if she drops 70 miles an hour at 55 mile an hour zone she's judged if she's caught there's a judgment in place that she's going to have to require her just go that judge or the justice system we're judged everything we're good Oh everything we do we're judge right can you go outside Renekton you in New York no one there's a law in place of judgment so everything's judge everything you can but the reason we can judge more like I said last time the reason we judge is because we have the Holy Ghost the Word of God and then we have the true revelation now you can't tell I say your mom but I would tell we've been raptured up we've been taken and put in a place that a lot of people honey we're in a place you know we're in a place that nobody then depends we are not the ones that judge why did you judge your guys you just didn't buy what the Holy Ghost knew was right and wrong what coming from the word diet it's like brother Clarence said about the gay community I'm not judging the gay community the Bible's already judging all right and if we hold the Bible to be the ultimatum then there you go back to the judgment tribe looking for Apollo you see one that you know so what you're doing is you're what we're doing this now is moral warning because program is warning then judgment so till you warn them what I've worn my children what the Word of God said if you're mourning if you're born and you're thought I mean if you're not born again you going to go to hell that's what the Bible is I send you that I'm just referring to what the judge the righteous judge that's why they under then judgment you will not have to stand there for millions and millions of years and judge every person they'll judge yourself in an instant everything he goes do their brand a lifespan or watch their whole life they live they knew where they went wrong they knew where God come to them and he they turn them down they'll know that right they'll know that so they don't have to set there you know you we have billions of people we got to stand there watch every one of them go to the line they're going to instantly know once they go to the line they're up there they come to the judgment bar the whole life is going to be given her the thing your life flashed before you okay though your life went on blast right before you eat so any well that's what happened in judge won't be it will go well now on marked for pain you did is right know they're going to be what the words going to be standing there in flesh Christ Enterprise going to be standing their flesh and with enough of the bride alters all through the ages those people most of them are going to have to have some contact with the people that standing in judgment it's going to be real hard when I told to buy the other day and let's just work a scenario you took them you take a man like that man it was in the Bible now he was committing fornication he was living with his stepmom he took extent homage guard living with her and Paul condemned it now what he done was is he repented and we rarely last not the quote over brother Graham said that man was restored back into the church it's hard for us to see because as humans we won't forget that he's always going to be that rascal that lived with his stepmom but if you know what it got clean here slate same way with all of us if we did something to somebody or somebody done something new in your life and that person becomes a born-again Christian he never did it we know he did but he never did that's what we got to understand the steel digit jokes of protection is that the real you did and you repent and God wipe that away but you kept on sinning again right but this form of justification times to here in the field shows grace that God has wiped your slate clean and if you're born again right if you're born again and then you come under here that what happens is is and I'm just doing it for illustration here you come up and you do something wrong okay I can't get off fast enough don't you say that but you know what you're saying and guess what I got doing it you saying and gods going I've been good at all someone or right you're a Samaritan say when you see what I mean you stand and us forgiveness there's no it's not something that stays like that so I said that's a acts of natural nc so pretty that's a natural occurrence but at you your slate is right here your sleep juices claim them that's what we do you know what we did we go with it we go don't we carry with us like I said before I was asking God to give me something to be a long time ago he said can't find it st. Clements in talking about I like that song but then do you know anymore I thought but see if the realization of that is what not it's not that I didn't do it I know I did this part of me did the service part of me did it but that real we never done it and what we got to see about the two lightest we'll ever text that you'll know one thing's for sure your first birth is going to keep reminding you daily but your second birth on the inside going to come about last night in that soul of man if you're born again it is why cannot have a speck of black in it never have expected lemon never Center that is my never better hard to believe cuz you not believing it now heartily but you guys don't do that then God save the group of people that didn't even want television now that nephew leads use but you know what here we go with the onion field that talk to you you didn't want it you didn't want you were not born and five six years old is your daughter all dogs and all you like you know you know what I'm saying this but right now you're going back to your life and going yeah I know what are you talking about things you're going back through what you did but you got to remember that the times that I stopped my brother Tim he does a good job it with a simple message but it was profound Friday night I mean profound about complexes and natures and and you know getting rid of the old and I really like what he said tell somebody that weren't here last night about it but exams at all you know you get those like a jewel that you get to allows you I love you is always me I wet tired the other day on the interstate so I must be punishing me for something he rained a little before buddies they know you can't is Allah Jesus no you don't have black eye you can't blame the things we deserve all of them crazy something mechanical I mean and I don't believe that God can restore mechanical things I don't get me wrong but there's a time and place the fiscal tear up real change the ladder don't you a word out just like us I mean here we are talking about here we are talking about the soul of man man eternal and here we are you know Aaron's in explain and the money going glasses on both feet no hair no it's those stuff so yeah but you know what that was it so that part of us we got to remember that wasn't a part of what God that wasn't the throne thoughts of God the eternal thought that God will touch you in eight year old or 78 year old body not the thoughts of God the eternal part now he thought of you being that but that was not the eternal section he felt section you never were yeah she's old to make real lot 75 yes that's all you but you see what I'm talking about we have little way of life that we live this was a life of people that live that's why the vault is your written epistle no then read of all men I can read you like a book yours what your life is an open book and you're always talking about a book but it's not literally a book so there's not going to be as a wife of judgment you know God doesn't pull out a big old leather book it's about that big that was a loud thing and go you know pull it over the desk fall off of it like you know I don't read this in a while no it's going to be your life your life doesn't come before you and you're not going to have a book there we're not going to have a Bible we won't have a Bible in the Millenium what we know right now is going to be so expanded and even now look what we know now we know what the millennium is going to be like we know what the future will be like we know what goes into the Millennium that won't go in the future home and vice versa we know that now what about will we get a glorified body and our mind is not tear mine is muddled now the things of life work family what's going to happen tomorrow will appear will still have tomorrow with my house what's going to tear down they call that if you just do that away from our life is be glorious but let's be eternal in heaven Pop's God you know that would be to me heavenly right it would never marry for the Genesis you can ask me sir well I said about that picture that dad got that showing the Bible in two pages flipping open and then it becomes Jesus Christ well not taking Jesus Christ out but because he became the book you will do this you know you can put your picture at the end of that at the end of that piece where it says in the beginning was worth we've gone over buh-bye so that same way with you or not that's for a problem in we've not come close enough to see that any especially plumber of the realms has been gone I told Bob because the brother was saying we'll give me a quote where brother Brown said that it's the first deal with black horse riders organic crops we know that but where it ties justification like we told you what Saul do a book it's a book of redemption it's a book of it's a book of redemption that you and I have for years it's been sealed up but now it's been over so we know I'm gonna step on out and say we know what the Prophet know what we know what the Prophet you about these sales we know that now we don't know many phonies compete with the problem so being in a prophetic age that's what we're going to talk about this stick sale derivative prophets is going to be a prophetic time they're going to speak they're already on Amanda Bible is full of what the judge what you've got the wrath of God and all this done before out of God what words you going to come through he promised most of their lives are going to the Jews because remember we're gone this is nothing to us as far as the natural happening it's reading then I'm to help me and open the sticks he'll blow it was a great earthquake Sun became black as sackcloth of hair we're fixing to see that in about two weeks old solar eclipse just few days from now here it's going to get a little bit dark but in the mountains I said it's going to get real Sharples in that path of getting real dark so the sun's become black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood regarding the Woodman see so this is tithing giving us a little idea because it's not this right here this is after we're gone this has been natural happening this is going to happen right but there's a spiritual application behind this okay and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll but it was roll when when it was rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places the king to the earth and great man the rich man and chief captain to the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks following us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb they let their I've done see Jesus it little drum and I will see the lamb but where is the lamb go to bed good problem while lambs listen lamb is always connected to Redemption right when you see a lamb sacrifice you're tying it back to ridiculous here is showing the wrath of the lamb through the two prophets because those you go to prophets the 144,000 are going to be like in Goshen but there it will be calling plays down on everything else on the outside I'm going back to the book of Exodus and reading that that truly God separated the people God is the segregate one he does not want us to miss race I'm not going up I'm talking about this - but see there of your natural application will appear not to miss race Baptist Methodist comes often sure we can be a mom only trying to help but in no way well I'm gonna start going to Baptist Church men y'all please people we've heard that before yeah you go to imagine church try to help somebody no but about the money to let them come to you let them come to you you go out there you go get a track and they have nothing God has separated what God did is go out see dojin if you Moses and you know what this is done where they approach the Bible but I can take and piece it together because remember when he called all those plagues if you'll read a book lessons they keep saying that children of ears were in Goshen and this didn't happen so there was a barrier that they do I put up anyoneís and Cody hall locusts do you can't build a bit Hine upkeep locust out you know and all the other things and it was so dark that time but there was lying noting why God had separated the people right so dr. segregation keeper said that he does not want you to mingle with all right we're into world war that's what brings us out instead of mouthing off followed us and how to prevent him sitting enthroned from there at the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand now there's your opening of your 60th right then next Sunday will remind me 24 to learn their book they're supposed order but we've already started our bullet points it's only going to happen through two problems right and it looks like to me that it's not going to only happen in the hearts of 144,000 but even nature is going to be controlled this outside of nature look at Moses man go back replay awesome he turned a whole river in the wood and study and then frogs come up out of that water in this thing love this came in the air it was no limit hey okay we can't miss that one they will hail came and beat everything down and then Pharaoh would let them go so the next week Moses goes back yesterday off even though bears didn't know another little doe he says okay darling god bear call locust and the Bible says whatever the hell didn't beat down the locust he said the land was completely barren other words it was all green and lush and pretty several weeks before that and then you look at in two weeks barren wastelands dry but now the one thing dosha was put through that that's the same way meeting you you are not going to be that goes remember when the children of Israel came out of Egypt they have problem right they died they got to eat the surfer got bit my surface they got there they got that right why because they turns on down but God protected that group of people saying I was you and I why brother camel tone that you know this is his whole message was on suffering you gotta suffer terrain get supper to rule you got through suffering he looked at home out talk about suffering which is great but sometimes we do have P parties you know about this one pound he did eighty difficult Sun shines on you one day that meeting like you friend he did just go - lightning and thunder and the wind's blowing doesn't mean it doesn't turn you down in other words like I'm going to sign up both of them dr. Sankar you know I mean we do that we go to a trial of wheat and listen but now what brother Hamilton is whole point was whatever we go through it were the children of God whatever we go through at that end of that trial we will be better if it was of God because it was chastisement of God to get us back in line now if it was just a Carm it was bald and you wonder why the world the thing look well you need Bob high-class you know it's the same balding up you know or a whole letting go buddy a powder it's not God's fault Paul either yeah I wrote them that easy glare out how does the one I call college go after the garden bland I don't want to let all this fall so anyway we Alto same thing will be sealed if you don't really understand and just try and get the first part get the natural happening that's what I'm trying to do it's going to the natural happening to the fifth seal is going to be to the Jew but it has a spiritual implication for you enough and it will change your body so this one we're going to talk about now it's going to talk about your nature not the nature of the outside world with your nature that will be my been something and we had a good times on the roof and not only that is that that our system and that the second box you know they're related in the restaurant they are real wildly prohibit outside you said they were gonna say Amazing Grace and I thought you guys never get out of that that's right so think about that yeah the bakelite there's an actual happening that's going to happen this is definitely when were gone these two prophets are going to absolutely make this happen because it's going to come right out of their mouths and what more than the spirit of Moses and Elijah that same spirit be called it whatever here the first time Moses just what I told you all the place moving Eliezer same thing like to call down halogen nothing rain and all these things fire came out of heaven there Mount Carmel and all things like that so their nature tells us that they're going to be able to what know what nature can do know what dog's mind is and to my auntie other things that what do you think that filled with the Holy Ghost now the two properties I don't believe that simply because if they're filled only goes right now when we go to wrap so they got to go with oh yeah right they got to go with us so they're going to have to receive it now they may be in the message but remember the brother over there now the intro he started them soma Jacobs tournaments and here man his son gets their permanent travesty say brothers stood right here Church you know it was opening but the messy church up in Israel your every yeah never years ago about yeah it's a whole thing just like what the people can't understand I'm telling you the teaching of the message is not getting to the people so they're being frustrated they're being they're being taught by false shepherds there are questions in the message that people cannot answer so what do they do what brother Brown must be wrong if he said there's they meant that he meant dish instead now to anyway so that brothers not measure so we can't count that message churches being anything where the do property come come on I'll buy they could be sitting in a message to church they could have been sitting at church and got justified sanctified know that but they will be bibble that holy goes into it because remember brother Brian said the Holy Ghost comes off of the Gentiles and turn to come drop back not only do why when it leaves this earth we're leaving with it we're leaving with it so the holy don't stay on is open to the Gentile you here one man to the Jindo and see what that's what's going to happen to I just thought of this it rule it's going to be over there in a laughing ocean relapsed into what the tribulation starts in American works its way to Israel so it's going to have a proud prosperity and actually I believe the whole world going to look to Israel so they're not going to have any problems there's nothing going to happen the prophets are not just going to call fire down in Israel Americans of the size to do something but yeah well you know earthquake over here all I gotta do these two properties just got away you know get a while get the thought of God that something's gonna happen China's getting ready to blow you all away well let's just give them the hailstorm for about three days and see how they survive because that's what they do probably some visitor we said he was so narrow-minded we think well there is going to be and Israel difficult Cole down a little things no no no no you see that right there the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty man ever bottom of every map no one hiding you drop you inherit no I don't not go to be a heaven but man another dimension I'll be an instrument but look at other stages is release the kings of the earth so this whole earth is gonna be tormented that's why the whole earth is going to give gifts when the two problems are killed the Bible says that the whole world started beating each other here won't cancel in other words CNN and Fox News they're all be there with their cameras programmed and all over the world hey these two people that tormented us they're finally dead and then while that cameras still open the bottle says three days they raise it up and they leave so then guess what that's when the wrath really followed on everybody but see integral will be in goshen just like God promised over there while Moses was on the same there was it going while the Elijah was on the scene there was a widow woman there was a widow woman that everybody started to death and every time she went and dipped into the tendons of oil and dipped into the end of the flour another spoke another difficult came back up yeah he's in your crews will never run dry and your flower pot will never run dry so what she'd dip it out make some more she man had a good program going she may give it to the community who knows to keep them huh but remember she was cute what saved from the blade by what property these because they are judgment to the outside world but you know what to integral 144,000 salvation comes to those who profits where'd you get those starters the Bible says there I'll read next under thing made Ezekiel says where'd you get those Jeremiah says where'd you get those card well then I'll go see Jesus they don't see Jesus through two products - problem is going to reveal to them that they're the ones until Jesus Christ and this is why this is happening you are going to be 500 44,000 we order to profit and in a 1260 days we're gonna get out of here see they have a time we don't we don't know where but man I'll tell ya I'm just oh yeah twelve hours if you day don't now you know yes I would like to feel any reason any way I was body that you'll be where's that yes will fill a little little tribulation before we get out of here but it won't be tribulation of the wrath of God it will be tribulation it's brought on America because remember all that we know it's going to come to two prophets but what we promised last night so by the arm again but you have posted yet okay until we leave it with but when we leave it went on that's going to be our protection yeah we out goat you it's about building the logo dunark ocean that our land of the ocean we're promised protection go say years over now he did everything else but he can't get to that song thank you yes this message to me is just blended and that's why we need to go but only men [Music] we will not be here when those profits in our region and here here did you make Arab brothers
