[1:52] come to a midweek service amen praise
[1:54] God you love the Lord you're excited
[1:57] about Jesus Christ you're a Christian
[2:00] you should be Amen but if you're not a
[2:04] Christian then you'll be sad and
[2:06] depressed and it's cold outside and I
[2:09] want to be home under the blankets but I
[2:11] want to be under this blanket tonight
[2:12] they man that's what covers me tonight a
[2:15] man so let's let's let's go to the word
[2:18] and hmm I don't want to keep you
[2:21] standing too long so I appreciate
[2:24] brother Dale giving us another
[2:25] opportunity again appreciate him and
[2:27] appreciate the confidence that he has in
[2:30] us ministers amen
[2:32] here at the church to share what God has
[2:35] given us to you all they matter
[2:37] praise the Lord if you want to turn with
[2:40] me to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter
[2:42] 1 and we start at verse 24 hmm I don't
[2:51] know if they got the little issue fixed
[2:53] back there that they were having with
[2:54] the notes I sent them but hopefully they
[2:57] did I was trying to put the notes in the
[3:04] same way that were the way but they'll
[3:07] usually usually do it you know by a
[3:09] number you know on the side and all that
[3:12] but little something went wrong there so
[3:15] we're working on it we're getting there
[3:17] amen amen
[3:21] what title this the perfect image of
[3:23] Christ and his bride amen
[3:26] it's message 101 but you know as Peter
[3:29] told them and second Peter I believe it
[3:31] was chapter 1 it says I won't fail you
[3:33] to put you into remembrance of these
[3:35] things lest you forget them amen and
[3:37] maybe maybe we might hear something
[3:40] tonight that somebody may need yeah
[3:42] praise the Lord because sometimes listen
[3:45] sometimes I hear I've heard brother Dale
[3:47] brother Wade some other other ministers
[3:49] here preach and then it just started
[3:51] somewhat just kind of goes over right
[3:53] but then months later another brother or
[3:55] the
[3:56] same brother comes and preaches the same
[3:57] thing and then it just strikes then you
[4:00] see so you kind of had to hear it that
[4:01] first time but then it's the second time
[4:03] around where it really sticks amen
[4:05] so um let's just let's just go to the
[4:08] word verse 24 says and God said let the
[4:12] earth bring forth living creature forth
[4:15] the living creature after his kind
[4:16] cattle and creeping thing and beast of
[4:19] the earth after his kind and it was so
[4:21] and God made the Beast of the earth
[4:23] after his kind and cattle after their
[4:26] kind and everything that creepeth upon
[4:28] the earth after his kind and God saw
[4:31] that it was good and verse 26 and God
[4:35] said let us make man in our image in our
[4:38] image all right after our likeness and
[4:41] let them have dominion over the fish of
[4:44] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[4:46] over the cattle and over all the earth
[4:48] and over every creeping thing that
[4:51] creepeth upon the earth so God created
[4:53] man in his own image in the image of God
[4:56] created he him male and female created
[4:59] he them amen then we're just gonna pray
[5:03] and then we'll we'll read another
[5:04] scripture there in just a moment so
[5:06] let's just bow our heads our gracious
[5:08] Lord once again we appreciate Father the
[5:10] opportunity to come before your people
[5:12] Lord God while there's just not any
[5:14] people but I believe it's the bride of
[5:16] Jesus Christ right here father God and
[5:18] thank you Lord Father for the
[5:20] opportunity that we have to not just
[5:22] speak your word but to hear your word
[5:24] Lord and father I pray that you would
[5:26] just get me out of the way Lord so that
[5:28] I would be able to be of edification to
[5:31] the people and you be glorified through
[5:33] what said and done this evening Lord
[5:35] father God may you continue to meet the
[5:38] needs amongst us so many sick ones
[5:40] amongst us Lord I pray that you would
[5:42] just heal touch those bodies Lord God do
[5:45] father God as you have died and you have
[5:48] you have already paid for Lord God those
[5:51] things and so we're just waiting for the
[5:54] manifestation of this healings father
[5:55] God to take place in their bodies we
[5:58] love you and we thank you we commit the
[6:00] rest of the service into your hands now
[6:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:04] amen amen praise God you may be seated
[6:08] this
[6:08] even if they want to if they want to
[6:13] pull up he fees chapter 4 Ephesians
[6:16] chapter 4 verse 7 hmm
[6:21] it says but unto every one of us is
[6:24] given grace according to the measure of
[6:26] the gift of Christ wherefore he saith
[6:30] when he ascended up on high he led
[6:31] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[6:34] men now now that he ascended what is it
[6:38] but that he also descended first into
[6:41] the lower parts of the earth is the
[6:43] speaking of Jesus he that descended is
[6:45] the same also that ascended up far above
[6:48] all heavens that he might fill all
[6:50] things remember he was it was given all
[6:53] power over all power over heaven and
[6:55] earth amen and he gave some apostles and
[6:59] some prophets and some evangelists and
[7:01] some pastors and teachers now watch this
[7:05] verse 12 for the perfecting of the
[7:06] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[7:09] the edifying of the body of Christ now
[7:12] verse 13 till we all come in the unity
[7:14] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[7:16] Son of God unto a perfect man so you
[7:20] found one perfection on verse 12 and
[7:22] then another perfection on verse 13 unto
[7:26] the measure of the stature of the
[7:27] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[7:30] no more children tossed to and fro and
[7:33] carried about with every wind of
[7:35] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[7:37] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[7:40] wait to deceive verse 15 but speaking
[7:44] the truth in love may grow up into him
[7:46] in all things which is the head even
[7:50] Christ from whom the whole body fitly
[7:54] joined together and compacted by that
[7:56] which every joint supplieth according to
[7:59] the effectual working in the measure of
[8:01] every part maketh increase of the body
[8:04] unto the edifying of itself in love amen
[8:09] well we'll discuss that in just a little
[8:11] while but as I said we want to talk
[8:17] about the perfect image of Christ in his
[8:20] bride amen
[8:21] and and later on just as a just as a
[8:25] word just so that you know I'm gonna
[8:28] give a little report about the mission
[8:30] trip that we did last last month so
[8:34] first and foremost I will thank each and
[8:36] every one of you all who who gave an
[8:39] offering and you certainly didn't have
[8:42] to do that
[8:42] appreciate brother Dale appreciate each
[8:44] and every one of you that took part and
[8:47] helping sending us over there amen
[8:49] and we'll just kind of let you all know
[8:52] what happened it was a short time but I
[8:55] believe I was done God had it planned
[8:57] like that way amen so so we just I'm
[9:01] trying not to be long this evening
[9:02] although I have some content that I want
[9:05] to get to you so so what is the
[9:08] definition of the word image the word
[9:10] image says that it's a reproduction or
[9:14] imitation of the form of a person or
[9:17] thing a mental picture the thought of
[9:20] how something looks or might look a
[9:23] visual representation of something a
[9:26] tangible or visible representation and
[9:29] then I like that last one a person
[9:31] strikingly like another person they
[9:34] meant this image that we're discussing
[9:37] here is that we're going to start
[9:40] talking about here of course his genesis
[9:42] is Adam in Genesis 1:26 brother Wade's
[9:45] favorite verse and we know that that he
[9:49] could not God could not create man in
[9:52] any other image but his image amen and
[9:54] so therefore when Adam came came forth
[9:57] out of out of God he was just like God
[10:01] amen it was that spirit man you know
[10:03] before before the the flesh came on Adam
[10:06] Adam had dominion over all things amen
[10:12] there was nothing that Adam could not do
[10:15] amen praise God so God had an image and
[10:18] he wanted man to be molded into this
[10:21] image amen
[10:23] now some some quotes if they want to
[10:26] pull up say I got they printed me out
[10:30] the
[10:32] number two you like you like brother
[10:38] Dale now saying pull out number two
[10:41] alright so we've read some of these
[10:44] quotes before and you've probably seen
[10:46] these quotes and just kind of
[10:48] solidifying the the the subject here so
[10:52] let's start here so he couldn't just
[10:54] leave at that state he had to leave
[10:56] something with it so he said let us
[10:58] plural make man flora in our own image
[11:01] let us make man in our own image so then
[11:03] when God made his first man he was a
[11:05] spirit man he was something on the order
[11:07] of God or the Son of God the logos that
[11:10] was the first man in the next one and I
[11:17] think they did fix it number three okay
[11:22] um the pillar of fire 1953 now the
[11:25] world's without form and void and water
[11:28] was upon the deep we're in Genesis one
[11:30] now see then he made all the plant life
[11:32] then after a while he made man in his
[11:34] own image and if he made man in his own
[11:36] image he had to make him something on an
[11:38] order of that supernatural beam right
[11:40] that's God amen
[11:42] and number four hmm the message the
[11:47] Messiah or the Branham says towards
[11:52] towards this last part now he is made in
[11:54] the image and likeness of God that makes
[11:56] his when God made him God gave him some
[11:59] of his spirit part of his life and he's
[12:01] in the likeness and the image of God
[12:03] amen and then let's read number five
[12:08] and then in the masterpiece brother
[12:11] Branham says but finally there came
[12:13] forth upon the earth a perfection and
[12:16] that was a man now I like the way he
[12:19] words it a perfection amen praise God
[12:22] because Saints remember we're supposed
[12:25] to come back to that same perfection
[12:26] amen
[12:27] praise God it started out perfect it
[12:29] must go back to perfection amen praise
[12:32] God and that was a man and then he could
[12:35] see in that man that it looked like him
[12:37] so now when he looked upon him he was a
[12:40] reflection of what his creator was God
[12:43] had now been able to achieve the thing
[12:45] that he wanted a man in his own image
[12:48] amen praise the Lord Jesus so that is
[12:52] what Adam was Amen it was an exact
[12:54] replica of what God was they meant now I
[12:57] can't remember was but Adam we know he
[13:01] had his his limitation was that he
[13:03] couldn't he couldn't be a savior right
[13:06] right he had all power but he couldn't
[13:09] be a savior you know because he couldn't
[13:11] save himself when when he failed you see
[13:14] he couldn't he couldn't save Eve when
[13:16] she fell they meant so so there was a
[13:19] limitation there but you get the picture
[13:22] of what I'm trying to say there was a
[13:23] perfection amen Adam was just like Jesus
[13:26] Christ amen praise God now so we see
[13:34] that in brother Branham now I encourage
[13:37] you all and I believe this is one of the
[13:39] messages of correct me if I'm wrong
[13:41] brother but they're one of the message
[13:42] that you requested the church to listen
[13:44] to this masterpiece listen to that
[13:48] message it's very good very good and if
[13:53] you listen to it already
[13:55] but listen to it again amen because he
[13:58] brings out some pretty pretty amazing
[14:01] things there and and so him he was he
[14:06] was he was talking to us about Moses and
[14:08] about the statue that Michelangelo made
[14:10] and that he created and that statue of
[14:15] Moses had a flaw amen
[14:17] because when Michelangelo had created it
[14:20] in
[14:20] had brought it up to a certain point and
[14:22] it was so real in the image that
[14:25] Michelangelo had for for Moses was so
[14:28] real to him that he thought he wanted
[14:31] the statue to speak and so he wanted it
[14:34] to speak it because he wanted to speak
[14:36] he struck it on the knee and when you
[14:38] look at it now there's a flaw there on
[14:40] the right hand side of the knee of that
[14:43] statue of Moses and we know that but
[14:48] he's all he's typing in that message
[14:49] he's typing you know what that what that
[14:52] that that it had to be struck
[14:55] just like Jesus had to be struck on on
[14:57] Calvary we see that Eve Adam had to come
[15:02] out out of a they men so Adam was struck
[15:05] as well on the side right out of her out
[15:08] of him came Eve and he uh you know God
[15:12] took out a rib and Eve came forth amen
[15:14] praise God and Eve was perfect there was
[15:18] no flaw there amen
[15:21] contrary to what people may say around
[15:25] the message you know that but they'll
[15:28] splendid before you know that he was
[15:29] just a byproduct you know but I believe
[15:33] you know cuz when Adam when Adam um when
[15:38] he fell asleep and when he woke back up
[15:40] the Bible says that God brought just
[15:43] like he brought to the Adam all the
[15:45] animals for him to name
[15:46] he brought Adam Eve amen and I said it
[15:50] before I just can't imagine you know
[15:52] it's just like when a man is gonna get
[15:54] married and what is the father when when
[15:57] the bride's father what is he doing he's
[15:59] bringing the the bride over to him as
[16:01] he's standing here waiting for her to
[16:04] come down the aisle he's excited he's
[16:06] happy amen
[16:07] now I can just imagine that Adam was
[16:09] just standing there as eveing for the
[16:11] father was bringing Eve to Adam amen it
[16:14] was it was a wedding taking place right
[16:16] amen so there so Eve was perfect she was
[16:21] beautiful she was just like Adam amen
[16:24] and this bride a man in the end time has
[16:27] to be just like Christ again praise God
[16:30] again we perfect it started all
[16:34] perfection and it must end up in
[16:36] perfection again amen praise God now of
[16:40] course we know that Satan came in in the
[16:42] picture and he marred the image amen
[16:44] he marred this image that that he had
[16:47] made he sin came in the picture and all
[16:50] and and we know that God had to start a
[16:55] process of restoring again the word amen
[16:58] praise God and so we see that God starts
[17:02] restoring his word through the four
[17:04] patriarchs first they meant he starts
[17:07] with the foundation of the restoration
[17:09] that started with Abraham god of course
[17:12] gave him the circumcision and last month
[17:15] I talked about a series about
[17:17] circumcision of the heart and then but
[17:19] it all started with Abraham amen and you
[17:23] know as God gave Abraham that that
[17:26] commandment the circumcision it was
[17:28] passed on through amen even unto the
[17:31] apex amen which was Moses say men at
[17:34] that time he still was practicing
[17:37] circumcision amen why because it was
[17:39] God's Word it couldn't it couldn't it
[17:42] could not go down it could not be faded
[17:45] away because it was God's Word amen
[17:48] - Abraham Amen so brother Branham says
[17:51] here in the message the masterpiece he
[17:56] says they could bring up number six I
[18:00] believe it is and now Abraham was the
[18:04] foundation of faith let's say it had
[18:06] four foundations the foundation of faith
[18:08] was Abraham the foundation of love was
[18:10] Isaac the foundation of grace was Jacob
[18:13] God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that
[18:15] but in Joseph was perfection right there
[18:18] is where he could set the monument upon
[18:20] not the first foundation the second
[18:22] foundation the third foundation but on
[18:24] the fourth foundation and we know Joseph
[18:26] and in that message brother Branham
[18:28] talks about how Joseph typified Christ
[18:30] and we've heard brother Barron speaking
[18:33] about that many times amen but it was
[18:35] the stature that that that faith that
[18:39] Abraham had a man started or that
[18:43] foundation was faith a man with Abraham
[18:46] right
[18:46] and why our foundation is it starts with
[18:49] faith right Amen you're born again have
[18:51] faith praise God and you have to grow
[18:54] into the stature of a perfect man right
[18:56] so that was the foundation and then
[18:59] there comes the apex a man which was
[19:02] Moses Amen Moses came on the scene and
[19:05] he was as far as I know he was one of
[19:08] the first prophets that he was given the
[19:10] commandment to speak the word and things
[19:13] came into existence not of his own doing
[19:16] but God was on in there working amen and
[19:19] so Moses we know he was a major profit
[19:22] brother branham in our day was a major
[19:24] profit right Moses was commanded to
[19:27] speak the word brother branham was
[19:29] commanded to speak the word amen
[19:31] Moses had called out a chosen people for
[19:33] God what did our prophet do in this day
[19:35] called out a chosen people for him amen
[19:38] praise God and through Moses we had
[19:41] several books written of the Old
[19:43] Testament as well including the book of
[19:47] Genesis letting us know that Moses had
[19:52] went back into the mind of God back in
[19:55] Genesis Amen praise God and it was Moses
[19:59] right there he was the apex of the word
[20:00] just like our Moses for our day brother
[20:02] Brandon I believe God showed him back in
[20:04] the day in Genesis Amen showed him
[20:07] things amen praise God and so God was
[20:12] was dealing with Moses but it had to
[20:15] start with those four foundations first
[20:17] right with with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[20:21] and Joseph amen
[20:25] praise God and then that and then the
[20:28] apex of that word then could come
[20:31] forward amen
[20:31] how many are with me to see I'm just
[20:33] trying to go kind of slow amen praise
[20:37] God but at the same time trying to go
[20:40] kind of fast I don't want to make words
[20:44] man no anyways but so we just thank God
[20:55] amen so through Moses we also received
[20:58] the command
[20:58] say man and there was certain
[21:00] Commandments amen that were given to us
[21:02] amen conduct order and doctrine and then
[21:05] it's our day praise God amen now but God
[21:08] was not done yet with Moses Moses went
[21:12] off the scene
[21:13] and we know that there was there needed
[21:15] to be more word to be restored amen and
[21:18] that word needed to come through the
[21:20] prophets amen through the prophets
[21:24] priests judges amen that came after
[21:27] Moses amen and brother Branham said
[21:30] brother Branham said I call it the
[21:32] fivefold ministry of that day amen
[21:34] praise God but brother Branham he told
[21:37] us that these prophets and they were
[21:39] building the body of Jesus Christ amen
[21:42] praise God and if you want to bring up
[21:45] number seven will read this quote real
[21:49] quick real quick says and then come
[21:55] finally the great head the head of all
[21:57] of it the rest of the body just spoke of
[21:59] it the foundation was laid by the
[22:01] patriarch but the body was built by the
[22:03] word which was the prophets they meant
[22:06] and here comes the head of all of it
[22:09] Jesus came on the scene there when his
[22:11] headpiece was put up on it we find in
[22:14] him the entire handiwork of God we find
[22:17] him the perfect reflection of the word
[22:18] for he was the word the fullness of the
[22:20] word now again God has the perfect
[22:22] masterpiece again they meant so
[22:24] throughout all of these prophets
[22:27] prophesied Elijah Isaiah and all of
[22:32] these prophets amen
[22:33] even the minor prophets God was still in
[22:37] restoration mode amen
[22:39] for his word amen bring in restoration
[22:42] that that restoration back there amen
[22:44] praise God built in the body of Jesus
[22:48] Christ they meant because there was to
[22:50] be an apex praise God
[22:52] come in to come in later on amen now we
[22:56] know that John the Baptist amen when he
[22:59] came on the scene I call him the pre
[23:01] apex it was the pre apex of those
[23:04] prophets before Jesus came
[23:06] amen he was the last May he was the last
[23:10] major prophet of the Old Testament and
[23:14] what was he to do it was to introduce
[23:17] the Messiah amen
[23:18] and John the Baptist was the only Old
[23:23] Testament prophet who could put his
[23:26] ministry back in the scriptures amen
[23:30] because they asked him they said where
[23:32] where are you who are you are you that
[23:35] Christ are you that one that's to come
[23:38] he said I'm not and they said well then
[23:40] who are you and he said I'm the voice of
[23:42] one that cries in the wilderness see
[23:43] quoting Isaiah 40 verse 3 amen and he
[23:47] was the only one out of the other
[23:48] prophets the prophets of the Old
[23:50] Testament as they were speaking they
[23:53] didn't they probably didn't know what
[23:54] they were they were doing half the time
[23:56] you know or even saying half the time
[23:58] but the word was coming forth and some
[24:00] of them they didn't want to be in that
[24:02] position like Lord what do you have me
[24:04] here to do this amen
[24:06] but they were commanded to speak the
[24:08] word and they could only do that amen
[24:10] and and you know a true Christian in
[24:13] this day a man why does he act the way
[24:16] he act what does she act the way she
[24:17] acts amen you can only do what's God's
[24:20] put inside of you amen i if it's not in
[24:24] you to be a Christian then you won't be
[24:26] a Christian you won't live like a
[24:28] Christian you won't act like a Christian
[24:30] they meant but if God has placed his
[24:32] spirit in you amen it'll quicken amen it
[24:35] will change you from day to day praise
[24:37] God amen so here comes John the Baptist
[24:40] and he introduced the Messiah amen
[24:43] and brother Branham came on the scene
[24:45] and this day and man what did he do he
[24:47] pointed us to Christ amen so brother
[24:49] Branham was a type of John the Baptist
[24:51] as well amen
[24:53] pointed us to Christ saying here comes
[24:55] the Lamb of God amen praise the Lord
[24:58] and we know that brother jesus said that
[25:01] there there have not risen or greater
[25:03] than John the Baptist
[25:06] he said notwithstanding he that is least
[25:08] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than
[25:10] he
[25:11] amen praise God speaking of speaking of
[25:14] you and me amen
[25:15] because John the Baptist he introduced
[25:17] us to the word
[25:19] amen but now it's you and me with the
[25:22] word inside of us hey man
[25:23] praise God making us greater than John
[25:26] the Baptist amen praise the Lord amen
[25:29] I believe this is one of the quotes yes
[25:33] verse eight I'm in quote eight number
[25:38] eight they bring that up John looking
[25:41] unto Jesus John the greatest of all
[25:43] prophets he was the one that introduced
[25:45] Jesus Jesus said he was greater than any
[25:48] man had been born did you ever think why
[25:51] that was all the rest of them spoke of
[25:53] him the word of the Lord comes to the
[25:55] Prophet that's the Bible said so and
[25:57] then all the other prophets it come to
[26:00] them in visions but when the word came
[26:04] to John it was flesh amen
[26:06] so Jesus right there vivid standing in
[26:09] flesh Jesus was the word he is the word
[26:12] he always was the word but here's where
[26:15] the fullness of God was made flesh and
[26:17] dwelt among us amen
[26:19] when he come to him in the water he was
[26:22] a prophet and if the word is made flesh
[26:24] has got to come to the prophet the word
[26:27] wherever it is it must come to a prophet
[26:29] because a prophet is the one is the word
[26:31] comes to and John was the prophet of the
[26:34] day praise the Lord amen
[26:36] so that was John the Baptist the pre
[26:39] apex and then finally came the apex amen
[26:43] which was the head a man that word body
[26:45] praise God Jesus Christ amen and we know
[26:49] that that that that he was so perfect
[26:54] and brother Bram speaks about this in
[26:55] that message the masterpiece but he was
[26:57] so perfect that God Himself dwelt in him
[26:59] amen praise God and he was exactly just
[27:03] like what God said amen he said if you
[27:06] see me you've seen the father
[27:08] amen so when you looked on Christ amen
[27:10] you were looking at God praise the Lord
[27:13] yeah and he could only do a man what the
[27:16] father showed him praise God so he was
[27:19] the apex of everything that those
[27:21] prophets in the Old Testament was was
[27:24] was bringing forth in visions here comes
[27:26] the apex Amen it was Jesus Christ they
[27:29] meant praise the Lord and
[27:32] and we know that also that apex Jesus
[27:35] Christ just like Moses Amen he spoke the
[27:38] word Amen Jesus Christ when he came on
[27:40] the scene he also spoke the word Amen
[27:42] praise God and we know that he was given
[27:45] authority to do that in Mount
[27:47] Transfiguration he said the the the
[27:50] father came down and said hear ye him
[27:53] amen so all the authority was on Jesus
[27:56] Christ they meant praise God and and of
[28:00] course this great apex he died for us
[28:01] amen
[28:02] praise God and I'm thanked I'm thankful
[28:04] that he did any man praise the Lord
[28:07] because where would we be without
[28:08] without him him amen praise the Lord and
[28:11] so brother Brown says here in the Knicks
[28:13] in the next next one number nine a lot
[28:22] of these they come from the same message
[28:23] the masterpiece it says remember Angelo
[28:28] could only cry out and smite the image
[28:30] and say speak but how different it was
[28:33] to God the great sculptor when he made a
[28:35] man in his own image so perfect that it
[28:38] reflected him God spoke through the
[28:40] image of man showing what he he would do
[28:43] he spoke through the prophets as they
[28:45] were in the potential image as he was
[28:48] bringing it up to the head amen
[28:51] but when he coming in the head he was
[28:53] all the image of God he was portraying
[28:56] himself then smitten for us now he is
[28:59] the masterpiece to us the gift of God
[29:01] Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we
[29:04] never forget that amen praise God so now
[29:11] the full apex was on Jesus Christ amen
[29:14] and we know that he is the head praise
[29:16] the Lord but the head amen
[29:19] he's not just a Cornerstone but he's
[29:21] also the head stone amen
[29:22] praise God that cornerstone has now
[29:24] become the head stone amen praise God
[29:26] didn't need that doesn't mean that he
[29:28] stopped being the cornerstone no he's
[29:31] still the cornerstone amen
[29:32] he's still the head stone a man because
[29:35] some people must see him first maybe as
[29:37] a cornerstone amen
[29:39] they may they may need
[29:41] eventually amen they will see him as a
[29:44] headstone amen praise God
[29:45] now and then of course we come down amen
[29:49] the bride of Jesus Christ had to come
[29:53] out through Jesus death amen
[29:54] we know that when Christ died he came
[29:57] forth on the day of Pentecost the bride
[29:59] came forth on the day of Pentecost
[30:00] perfect amen
[30:02] no fault no denominations no nothing
[30:06] involved there a man she came perfect
[30:08] amen
[30:09] but of course we know Satan had came on
[30:11] the scene again tomorrow the image amen
[30:14] tomorrow what God was doing amen so then
[30:17] God had to go into restoration mode
[30:19] again praise the Lord amen but you know
[30:22] God has a purpose for all these things
[30:23] amen praise the Lord because his whole
[30:26] his whole thing is all about Redemption
[30:28] amen this whole thing that we see in our
[30:33] day it has nothing to do but with it has
[30:36] to do with with Redemption amen God's
[30:39] just concerned about redeeming amen
[30:40] praise the Lord and it's not bring him
[30:43] back amen
[30:44] putting it back in into a different
[30:47] condition no it's putting it back in the
[30:48] same condition that it was in the
[30:50] original amen praise the Lord when you
[30:52] go to the when you go to the pawnshop
[30:55] amen and you put something you pawned
[30:58] something and you want to take it back
[31:00] out you expect for them to give you what
[31:02] you put that what you gave to them amen
[31:05] not something different amen praise God
[31:07] so you go in to redeem that what that
[31:10] was yours that belongs to you amen
[31:12] praise God now so we know Satan came
[31:16] into picture and of course brother
[31:19] Branham talks about how the bride fell
[31:21] at Nicaea room and she had to die out in
[31:27] order to spring forward with life amen
[31:30] just like Jesus had to die amen that
[31:34] that life may come forth same thing with
[31:37] the Bride of Christ they meant if the
[31:39] corner of wheat does not fall and die
[31:41] and rot then there was no life to come
[31:43] forth amen
[31:44] praise God and God said I will restore
[31:47] says the Lord amen
[31:49] praise God and he was going to restore
[31:51] amen
[31:52] and so God started another rebuilding
[31:55] process they
[31:55] this body again praise God praise the
[31:59] Lord Jesus now if we turn let's turn to
[32:03] Ephesians chapter 2 and it's I'll get
[32:10] used to this you I'll get there number
[32:15] 10 is it amen
[32:22] praise God Ephesians chapter 2 because
[32:27] we know that God he started building a
[32:29] man the body of Christ by the foundation
[32:33] of the apostle's amen
[32:35] just like he started with the foundation
[32:37] back in the Old Testament with the
[32:38] patriarchs then he starts now again with
[32:41] the foundation of the Apostles if he's
[32:43] chapter 2 it says now therefore you are
[32:46] no more strangers and foreigners but
[32:48] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[32:50] the household of God and are built upon
[32:52] the foundation of the apostles and
[32:55] prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the
[32:57] chief Cornerstone they meant in whom all
[33:01] the building fitly framed together
[33:03] groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord
[33:05] in whom ye also are builded together for
[33:08] in habitation of God through the spirit
[33:10] amen
[33:11] so this this restoration process starts
[33:16] out with the with the Apostles amen with
[33:19] Mark Matthew Mark Luke and John amen and
[33:22] then and all those all those all those
[33:24] and we know all these things amen but
[33:27] that's how it needs to start and so God
[33:29] continued this building process through
[33:31] the church age messengers again amen
[33:33] praise the Lord and then through the
[33:35] fivefold ministry amen and this in this
[33:38] hour amen
[33:39] and all these parcels and prophets and
[33:42] messengers faithful ministry culminated
[33:44] to a pre apex amen and this day as well
[33:46] praise God and the pre apex that I'm
[33:50] talking about just as John the Baptist
[33:51] was the pre apex amen to Jesus Christ
[33:54] they meant brother Branham came on the
[33:56] scene amen
[33:57] praise the Lord and we know that
[33:58] throughout church the seven church age
[34:01] messengers brother Branham being the
[34:02] seventh church age messenger and he
[34:05] introduced us as I said earlier to
[34:07] Christ amen praise God and we know that
[34:11] this message is the capstone amen praise
[34:13] God and as you I don't know if some of
[34:16] you were here last time but I preached
[34:18] about when we crossing over into into on
[34:21] to the other side into the promised land
[34:23] and even when the Israelites when they
[34:25] crossed over to the promised land
[34:27] they're still they still had to fight
[34:30] they still had to take full possession
[34:33] of their of
[34:34] their inheritance amen praise God and
[34:37] and we maybe in this message a man and
[34:40] maybe in this message for 50 years amen
[34:42] but we still have to fight and take full
[34:44] possession of our inheritance praise God
[34:47] a man there's still a devil out there a
[34:49] real devil that we need to fight amen
[34:51] praise God because just as the children
[34:54] of Israel that when they crossed over
[34:56] they had to take over Jericho amen
[34:58] Jericho wasn't going to take over itself
[35:01] God had already told him that they
[35:03] needed to take over Jericho and there so
[35:05] therefore they needed to they needed to
[35:08] conquer but it wasn't a man it was
[35:10] through the help and guidance of leaders
[35:13] of ministry of that our priests but at
[35:17] the same time who was leading them for
[35:19] real it was the Holy Spirit Joshua at
[35:21] that time a man witnesses a type of the
[35:23] Holy Ghost amen and it's the Holy Ghost
[35:25] that's leading the bride amen the the
[35:27] Church of God in this hour amen and it's
[35:30] not it is it is man but at the same time
[35:35] it's God through men amen praise God
[35:38] because we're gonna read something here
[35:40] in just a moment that it that it's it's
[35:44] that the man a man cannot lead you to
[35:49] the other side or can't lead you a a
[35:51] head Amen if it's not God through the
[35:53] man then then it that it's man can't
[35:56] lead you amen praise God so so just like
[36:02] the children of Israel crossed over to
[36:03] the promised land they still had to
[36:04] fight and conquer Jericho amen we need
[36:07] to fight and conquer our Jericho
[36:09] I mean we're maybe in this message amen
[36:11] but we have to fight and conquer this
[36:12] Jericho amen this Jericho still needs to
[36:15] fall amen we're waiting for the
[36:17] redemption to wit amen the the witness
[36:21] the retention of these bodies amen
[36:23] praise God Jesus Christ came to that
[36:26] praise the Lord and now this body that's
[36:28] being built again this restoration of
[36:31] this body of this broad tree amen must
[36:34] needs to come to that as well praise God
[36:36] praise the Lord
[36:37] so now how many are still with me a may
[36:40] I understand the one I'm trying to say
[36:42] praise God
[36:43] again message 101
[36:46] but you I hope this isn't new to
[36:49] somebody to you a man they praise the
[36:53] Lord so and we know now that God he's
[36:59] putting the finishing touches to this
[37:01] image amen
[37:02] through the fivefold ministry and that's
[37:03] our day amen
[37:06] they're there therefore we cannot look
[37:11] down upon the fivefold ministry because
[37:13] it's in the word it's in there it's part
[37:17] of the word amen
[37:18] we need the fivefold ministry but as we
[37:21] were as we as we will look here in just
[37:23] a moment it's the Holy Ghost through
[37:25] those man praise the Lord
[37:27] is and it's not really through those man
[37:28] but it's the gifts a man that those
[37:30] gifts that God has given those men
[37:32] praise Lord because they weren't durr's
[37:34] and they're not their gifts those gifts
[37:36] were given to them for us praise God
[37:39] amen praise the Lord so if we turn to
[37:43] Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4
[37:52] let's just read this here amen
[38:00] and he gave some apostles and some
[38:03] prophets and some evangelists and some
[38:06] pastors and teachers now some people
[38:09] they think that that what that scripture
[38:12] is speaking about is that he gave some
[38:13] you know that not all of them are gonna
[38:16] be apostles and that not all of them are
[38:18] gonna be prophets not all are gonna be
[38:20] evangelists
[38:20] which is true you know that's not but he
[38:24] gave some apostles in other words we all
[38:28] need these fivefold ministry right amen
[38:31] it's not that that that you are gonna
[38:35] you're your key ministry is the is the
[38:39] pastor and you can't receive anything
[38:41] else from any of the other ministries no
[38:43] you need all five of these ministries
[38:46] amen
[38:47] praise God but one of them is going to
[38:49] speak to you more praise God
[38:52] God is going to use one of those to
[38:54] speak to you more to cause you a man to
[38:57] draw closer to Christ amen praise the
[39:00] Lord
[39:00] so you know some of us and evangelist is
[39:05] what speaks to us more amen that's
[39:07] perfectly fine but you can't neglect the
[39:10] pastor either some of us may need a
[39:13] pasture you know to speak to us more but
[39:16] you can't neglect the teacher or neglect
[39:18] the Evangelist you see you need all all
[39:21] of these amen
[39:23] in order to for this body a man to be
[39:26] fully grown amen praise the Lord
[39:28] now verse 12 let's look at this because
[39:31] I want out this is our this is where I
[39:33] want to concentrate amen I'm just kind
[39:35] of I was bringing all that foundation
[39:37] now I want to concentrate on this verse
[39:39] 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for
[39:42] the work of the ministry for the
[39:45] edifying of the body of Christ praise
[39:48] the Lord now if we look at that in and
[39:52] if we bring number 12
[39:53] real quick number 12 and then we can go
[39:59] back to this one that word perfecting
[40:01] there is the word cut out dismiss and
[40:05] I'm glad that Greek sounds like Spanish
[40:07] because I can pronounce it
[40:10] got artis mas which means complete
[40:14] furnishing or equipping amen praise God
[40:18] this is what the fivefold ministry is
[40:21] supposed to do for the body of Christ
[40:22] amen
[40:23] it's to equip you Amanda just as we said
[40:27] here the the the the minister just all
[40:29] he does is just kind of takes the scales
[40:31] out from your eyes amen praise God
[40:34] sometimes we we got our scales the
[40:36] scales have been removed on Sunday but
[40:38] on Tuesday they're back on again and I
[40:41] don't know and so you need Wednesday to
[40:44] have them removed again they men praise
[40:46] God we need to constantly have that word
[40:49] be around that word be ministered to
[40:52] amen because why we are sheep amen we
[40:56] need guidance amen
[40:58] we need we need we need somebody live
[41:02] that can help us for the things that are
[41:04] taking place in this our day you see
[41:06] amen praise the Lord you know we know
[41:10] brother Branham he spoke in the tapes
[41:13] and he spoke about things amen
[41:15] that was let's take for example Elvis
[41:18] Presley you'd speak to the young people
[41:21] today they can't identify with Elvis
[41:23] Presley they don't know Harley of them
[41:25] they don't even know who Elvis Presley
[41:27] is right but when you're dealing with
[41:29] the youth Amen why do you you know I've
[41:32] learned day if you start talking to them
[41:33] the modern things that they know about
[41:35] the kind of music and artists and things
[41:38] that they know about then it kind of
[41:40] strikes a chord with them and then it
[41:41] kind of it they listen to you more you
[41:44] see but when you start talking about
[41:46] Elvis Presley or just reading what
[41:47] brother Bram said about Elvis and the
[41:51] other the other characters that live
[41:53] back then I don't know but I had my time
[41:56] you know you all know my days was
[41:59] Michael Jackson and all that but yeah
[42:06] bad that's right
[42:11] and so now not diminish it but brother
[42:15] Branham was hitting a spirit at that
[42:17] time you see it's that same spirit do
[42:20] you know and so so we need
[42:24] we need we need not to forget a man that
[42:27] it's okay that we listen to the tapes
[42:30] you have to listen to the tapes amen but
[42:33] of course as I said last time you know
[42:35] we need also live ministry as well
[42:37] praise God because there's things going
[42:40] on in our day that a pastor and a
[42:42] minister can deal with that that need to
[42:45] be dealt with at that time a man that
[42:48] cannot be dealt with through the tapes
[42:50] you see what I'm saying you know how can
[42:54] a pastor a pastor would not be able to
[42:57] give guidance you know just through the
[43:01] tapes a mentor may be met some marriage
[43:03] counselor or something like that you
[43:05] need some live people that are amen
[43:08] somebody that and so this perfect thing
[43:11] are the same so what what this this
[43:13] powerful ministry what is doing is
[43:14] furnishing amen a man is equipping the
[43:18] people amen the Dame but did they
[43:20] continue forward that's what this word
[43:22] perfecting is amen and so if we continue
[43:26] reading amen so in well let me see here
[43:31] in in the next quote and I believe it's
[43:34] number 14 brother Branham says here so
[43:39] the church is not in its right state yet
[43:42] we have to remember that it's not
[43:45] matured so we just have to linger and do
[43:49] the best we can and there's no one can
[43:52] bring it to maturity only the Holy
[43:54] Spirit as we listen to it
[43:56] amen praise God I don't believe it will
[44:00] ever come by man it'll have to come by
[44:02] God now some people could take that and
[44:05] just run off with it
[44:07] but remember amen then that negates what
[44:11] God said in Ephesians chapter 4 you see
[44:13] so they have to run in line I believe
[44:15] it's the Holy Spirit through the man
[44:17] praise God amen
[44:19] it was God using the man in this hard
[44:22] day to bring us to point us to Christ
[44:25] amen
[44:25] brother branham amen why would he DPA it
[44:28] from that praise the Lord Amen so the
[44:32] church is furnished and equipped through
[44:34] this powerful ministry through the
[44:36] leadership of the whole ego
[44:38] stay man and we know and as we know that
[44:42] when the children of Israel they crossed
[44:44] over a man they had leadership at that
[44:46] time as well but Joshua was the one that
[44:48] was the ultimate leader praise God and
[44:51] the word of the Lord would come to
[44:53] Joshua praise God
[44:54] amen now okay so now let's look at this
[45:07] next verse and let's go back to number
[45:10] 11 brothers I appreciate their patience
[45:14] back there yeah amen amens
[45:18] so let's let's read verse 13 amen it
[45:22] says till we all come in the unity of
[45:26] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[45:29] Son of God amen to the unity of the
[45:31] faith amen praise God unfortunately I
[45:36] don't believe that everybody's come to
[45:37] that yet but we're coming to that amen
[45:41] praise God and know the knowledge of the
[45:44] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[45:48] measure measure of the stature of the
[45:50] fullness of Christ so now when you look
[45:54] at this word perfect here it's the word
[45:57] Helios and that's number third 13 number
[46:04] 13
[46:09] it's the word Pelias it's a Greek which
[46:12] means brought to it and/or finished
[46:16] wanting nothing necessary to
[46:19] completeness amen
[46:21] perfect that which is perfect a man full
[46:26] grown adult or full age mature a man
[46:31] praise the Lord so there's that process
[46:35] now you needed the fivefold ministry
[46:36] amen to help with that amen but they're
[46:39] not the ones who bring you to that amen
[46:41] really it's the Holy Spirit's God
[46:43] through those men that bring you through
[46:44] that - to this perfection amen praise
[46:47] God amen so so because listen Saints I
[46:53] could preach the word brother Dale could
[46:54] preach the word brother Wade brother
[46:56] Aaron brother Bob any minister that
[46:58] comes here preaches the word but if
[47:00] you're not doing your part amen then we
[47:04] can't bring you anywhere we can't take
[47:06] you in you the Holy Spirit can't deal
[47:08] with you a manner you see what I'm
[47:10] saying you have to have your part in
[47:13] this as well they men praise God we
[47:16] can't do it all for you you need to take
[47:20] part
[47:20] amen as well there is a part for you to
[47:22] speak the bride again and we'll look at
[47:24] this later but the bride must prophesy
[47:25] again amen praise God you have a part in
[47:30] this now how do you have a part in this
[47:33] it's simple in your everyday life you
[47:37] sisters when you're in the kitchen and
[47:39] you can minister when you are at work
[47:43] brothers that don't minister a man you
[47:45] can minister there amen
[47:48] young people children at school you can
[47:51] be ministers there amen and it doesn't
[47:54] mean preaching but it means the life
[47:56] that you live for it Amen that that
[47:59] people can see amen that God something's
[48:02] different about this this young man this
[48:04] young boy this this man at work here
[48:06] something's different Amen something
[48:08] something I I'm drawn to that amen
[48:11] praise God so we we can only do a
[48:18] certain part amen
[48:20] God and if you don't if we don't
[48:22] surrender to God fully amen then God
[48:24] can't can't can't fully do his part with
[48:28] you you see amen
[48:29] a simple amen but it's just one of the
[48:33] is the toughest things for us to do we
[48:36] fell God in the most simple things in
[48:38] life what is it
[48:40] because look I've been there I've done
[48:42] that in the simplest things and God all
[48:45] requires for you to do is is read your
[48:47] Bible and pray every day and that is the
[48:50] toughest things for some of us
[48:51] Christians to do why because there's
[48:55] power in those things amen praise God
[48:58] sure you can come and listen to the word
[49:00] but if you don't have your own time with
[49:02] Christ amen then you need that that
[49:07] personal time with the Lord amen praise
[49:09] God amen and and you know that's one
[49:13] thing that's so easily for us to get
[49:15] away from you know because in coming to
[49:19] a church like this where the word is
[49:21] preached and we get deep in the word and
[49:24] and we think we can just lay it all on
[49:27] them all in brother Dale and we'll go in
[49:29] because we go to spoken word church in
[49:31] Lula Georgia no I don't think so
[49:34] you're not going in just because your
[49:36] pastor preaches the word the full word
[49:38] Amen you're going in because you have
[49:41] your own relationship with Christ the
[49:43] Holy Ghost is dwelling in you amen
[49:46] praise the Lord
[49:47] I'm not going in under because brother
[49:50] brother Daylesford I respect but but
[49:53] under brother Dale's coattail amen
[49:56] I've got to go under his tail amen
[49:59] and he's not a coattail he's wings amen
[50:02] I want to be under his wings they men
[50:04] and then but you know under his wings
[50:07] under the leadership of Christ amen is
[50:09] gonna make me want to listen to brother
[50:11] Dale who's gonna make me want to listen
[50:12] to the fivefold ministry it's not gonna
[50:14] say well you don't listen to the
[50:16] fivefold ministry amen no that's as
[50:18] contrary to the word praise God amen so
[50:23] young people I encourage you and and and
[50:28] kids
[50:31] listen just because you come to church
[50:33] every day and your mom and dad bring you
[50:35] to church every single Wednesday and
[50:37] Sunday but if you don't know that you
[50:40] have Christ in your heart you better get
[50:42] to it
[50:43] amen it's got to be a personal
[50:47] relationship with you and God amen not
[50:51] it's not a relationship with you and
[50:53] brother Dale amen
[50:54] I mean that it with respect you know but
[50:57] but Bertha Dale can't take you in amen
[50:59] he can give you the word but you have to
[51:01] do something with that word
[51:03] praise God amen I have to do something
[51:06] with that word amen praise the Lord
[51:09] Jesus so so and then verse 14 says there
[51:15] in in in number eleven says that we
[51:18] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[51:21] and fro and carried about with every
[51:23] wind of doctrine by the sleight of man
[51:26] you know your one day here believing two
[51:29] souls and then the next day you're over
[51:31] here believing two Lords and then and
[51:36] then if you mix the two together you get
[51:38] two swords and you're believing all
[51:41] kinds of things you know there's just
[51:44] believing I I wouldn't be surprised if
[51:48] that's the next one that comes out two
[51:49] swords you know you know that's that's
[51:53] souls and Lord just put together but you
[51:59] know but in this hour day Saints it's
[52:01] come more deceiving now a man it's come
[52:05] closer now that it'll deceive the very
[52:06] elect if it was possible right again as
[52:10] I said last last time I I'm Ennis turd
[52:12] and you know but if there's gonna be any
[52:15] deception it's gonna come out of this
[52:16] own message this message amen it's not
[52:21] gonna come out of anybody else the
[52:23] Pentecostals or the Baptist's you know
[52:26] it's gonna come from people within the
[52:28] same message Amen that's gonna say
[52:30] things to you and it's gonna preach
[52:32] things to you that sounds so good and
[52:34] sounds so just I mean they'll give you
[52:38] 99 percent word because that's what the
[52:40] devil does
[52:41] amen but it's that 1% that'll get you
[52:44] that you'll be deceived amen so that's
[52:48] what we need to be in the full word amen
[52:50] praise the Lord now let's see verse 15
[52:57] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[53:01] up into him in all things which is the
[53:05] head even Christ amen praise God in
[53:09] verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly
[53:12] joined together and compacted by that
[53:14] which every joint supplieth according to
[53:17] the effectual working in the measure of
[53:19] every part maketh increase of the body
[53:22] unto the edifying of itself in love you
[53:26] know in verse 15 it speaks about love
[53:28] and then verse 16 talks about love as
[53:31] well amen
[53:32] now brother branham's it says here in
[53:34] number 15 I believe it is ready could
[53:38] bring up number 15 a minute because
[53:43] remember we're talking about God
[53:44] building this image amen and it is in it
[53:48] and then he restarted it again and at
[53:51] the day of Pentecost bringing coming up
[53:53] through the seven Church Ages and then
[53:55] coming now in this hour day and this in
[53:57] the bride amen and we and we are here
[54:01] Saints we are at this at this with this
[54:03] the this message amen praise God but it
[54:08] must be capped amen it must be capped
[54:12] remember the Brahm says here Tom shall
[54:16] be no more he announces that time is
[54:18] over what happens what happens could
[54:20] that be so now brethren seriously think
[54:22] if it is then the pyramid is capped by
[54:25] the seven thunders Amen you remember the
[54:28] pyramid message it's the capstone what
[54:31] did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the
[54:33] individual and seal it when we added to
[54:36] our faith righteousness and godliness
[54:38] and faith and so forth and kept adding
[54:40] to it till we got seven things and the
[54:43] seventh one was love which is God amen
[54:47] that's how he makes the individual and
[54:50] caps ium and seals him with the Holy
[54:51] Spirit amen
[54:52] praise the Lord amen and it's not just
[54:55] love Amen but it's perfect love praise
[54:58] God and because we're talking about here
[55:02] the perfect image of Christ amen
[55:04] it's not it has to be perfect love
[55:07] because remember when brother Brandon
[55:08] went over past the curtain of time they
[55:11] said they told him that nothing comes in
[55:13] here and unless it has perfect love amen
[55:15] you're not gonna get there right man
[55:17] without perfect love praise the Lord and
[55:19] that perfect love can only come through
[55:21] Christ amen praise God and so now we
[55:27] look here at the definition of the word
[55:30] perfect and I don't know if I got this
[55:33] written yes it's number 16 we're almost
[55:37] finishing up sayings word perfect I like
[55:43] this it says being entirely without a
[55:49] fault
[55:50] or defect flawless a perfect diamond
[55:53] praise God and you know with for you to
[55:58] be a diamond that reflects light amen
[56:02] because when diamonds are first product
[56:04] you know brought out of the earth
[56:06] you know dug down there they don't look
[56:09] they look bad they look they're ugly
[56:11] they don't look like these things would
[56:12] give off light or anything like that
[56:14] amen but the reason why a diamond gives
[56:18] off light is because it needs to be cut
[56:21] amen
[56:22] once it's cut then it can brick it can
[56:25] give off life because of the different
[56:27] corners that the light is striking and
[56:29] then it can bring forth the light amen
[56:31] praise God and so you know if you're not
[56:34] if you're not cut by the word if you're
[56:38] not cut by the Holy Spirit if you're not
[56:40] as I've been to last time that's that's
[56:43] circumcision for the second time amen
[56:45] just like in it we read in Joshua amen
[56:48] you're not gonna give off light amen you
[56:51] must be cut amen praise God you must
[56:54] have this word cut you amen you must
[56:57] have you must fall sometimes amen
[57:00] in order that you get up and learn the
[57:02] lesson and say Lord Here I am I'm ready
[57:05] to shine you
[57:06] with your light amen praise God so many
[57:08] times Saints that I've had to learn my
[57:12] lesson the hard way and then so many
[57:15] times I've had to learn my lesson the
[57:17] hard way and then I've had to learn
[57:19] lesson my hard way again because just
[57:23] the first time I only learned part of it
[57:25] then I go at it again and then it's the
[57:27] second third sometimes fourth times you
[57:30] know but you know there comes a point
[57:35] where God reveals that to you and says
[57:38] and you say alright Lord there I am
[57:42] mould me a man cut me and it's not just
[57:45] cutting second time but cut me third
[57:47] time fourth time fifth times six times
[57:49] amen praise God and so we continue
[57:52] reading here this this definition of the
[57:55] word perfect says satisfying all
[57:58] requirements accurate corresponding to
[58:03] an ideal standard or abstract concept of
[58:06] perfect gentleman faithfully reproducing
[58:09] the original I like that amen because
[58:13] that's why it's perfect they man that's
[58:14] perfect
[58:15] amen remember Christ when he came on the
[58:17] scene a man after the board the the
[58:20] prophets built his body amen he was the
[58:22] perfect image of Christ amen and he is
[58:25] the headstone amen and so he's the
[58:27] headstone and as we're being called up a
[58:30] man into this into this stature of a
[58:32] perfect man were called to this
[58:34] perfection amen we're called to come
[58:37] back to this perfect image that Christ
[58:39] was a man and really if you think about
[58:42] it Saints his perfect image was he was
[58:46] perfect yes while he was here on earth
[58:48] but his total perfection was after he
[58:51] resurrected amen and from that from the
[58:54] grave amen because why he's redemption
[58:55] of his body amen his his physical body
[58:58] was redeemed at that time amen praise
[59:00] God that's why that's why he died a man
[59:03] as a man because that part Amen wasn't
[59:06] he he was still sick he could still get
[59:08] sick brother Brennan said even he said
[59:10] he had a headache and and all these
[59:12] things they meant just like you and I
[59:13] amen but that's what we are supposed to
[59:16] get to a man as to that perfect image of
[59:18] Christ
[59:20] man at capstone a man that perfect love
[59:23] amen praise the Lord let me tell you
[59:26] saying sigh you know perfect love dwells
[59:30] within us but sometimes we don't portray
[59:32] perfect love amen so I could say I could
[59:37] say man we not all have come to that
[59:39] amen
[59:40] we're still growing up to that amen to
[59:43] that perfect love amen sometimes we just
[59:47] have perfect hate and that's what we
[59:50] demonstrate it's perfect hate a perfect
[59:55] foolishness or perfect you know
[59:58] sometimes our mouth speaks faster than
[1:00:01] our brains thinking you know and then we
[1:00:03] we we don't watch what we say in and we
[1:00:07] and we we offend our brother and our
[1:00:10] sister amen you know so that's why the
[1:00:15] Bible calls this this device here uh
[1:00:18] what does it say yes it's a tongue that
[1:00:21] the tongue that causes many fires you
[1:00:24] know that can't be tamed but I believe
[1:00:28] God through the Holy Spirit has given us
[1:00:30] the power to attain this Tony amen
[1:00:32] praise the Lord amen mmm and so I see
[1:00:38] faithfully reproducing the original
[1:00:40] legally valid expert a pure total
[1:00:43] lacking in no essential detail complete
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] when Michelangelo was was building this
[1:00:51] statue of Moses all the details that was
[1:00:54] there that needed to be done there came
[1:00:56] a point Amen that he put all the details
[1:00:59] that he could in that and he figured and
[1:01:02] he came to a point where this is perfect
[1:01:04] this is the exact image that I had in my
[1:01:07] mind and now here it is visible they
[1:01:09] meant and even from the beginning Christ
[1:01:12] they meant God had an image about what
[1:01:14] this bride was going to look like amen
[1:01:16] and right now I believe through the
[1:01:17] thoughtful ministry he's going in there
[1:01:20] and bringing out the details amen in
[1:01:22] this bride amen praise God you know
[1:01:25] because it's not just putting forth the
[1:01:28] foundation amen you must also build that
[1:01:31] body but and then and then you
[1:01:33] have the head amen but also bringing in
[1:01:35] details as well amen
[1:01:37] praise God but you had Michelangelo when
[1:01:40] he was building the body of Moses there
[1:01:41] through that statute he the the curls of
[1:01:44] Moses beard beard and all these
[1:01:47] different things you know had to come
[1:01:49] and then it was a striking replica of
[1:01:52] what Moses could have looked like
[1:01:54] now that was Michelangelo's image a man
[1:01:56] what about you know God's image about
[1:01:58] this bride a man praise God that he had
[1:02:01] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:02:04] brother Branham says here in this
[1:02:06] message and this is number 17 it says
[1:02:15] conferences just let this fire come to
[1:02:19] this fire and after a while you'll find
[1:02:21] out I'll move to that it will come up
[1:02:22] through Luther Wesley Pentecost and find
[1:02:24] out the pyramid will be capped one of
[1:02:26] these days you know it never was kept
[1:02:29] the pyramid on the back of your dollar
[1:02:31] the Great Seal it says and we in America
[1:02:33] here is the American seal on this side
[1:02:36] but why did it say the Great Seal the
[1:02:38] one that Enoch made not pyramid
[1:02:40] doctrines now because I don't believe in
[1:02:42] that kind of stuff but they never did
[1:02:44] cap the pyramid why the capstone was
[1:02:47] rejected but it will come again someday
[1:02:49] praise the Lord now watch this and see
[1:02:52] in that pyramid I've been there it's
[1:02:54] honed so close to leaving you can't run
[1:02:56] a razor blade there's no mortar between
[1:02:59] it it just perfectly sets together like
[1:03:01] the same stone and when the church gets
[1:03:04] honed into the perfect image of Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ
[1:03:07] he will come resurrect all the saints
[1:03:10] when he comes and take them with him the
[1:03:13] Church of the Living God will be caught
[1:03:15] up amen praise God
[1:03:17] the resurrection amen will take place
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:21] hey it'll be Jesus Christ through us
[1:03:25] amen praise God it's not our own power
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:30] but it's his power amen through us
[1:03:31] praise God amen now
[1:03:36] and so this perfect image of Christ in
[1:03:39] his bride just as Moses spoke the word
[1:03:43] Christ came on the scene spoke the word
[1:03:45] Amen brother branham came on the scene
[1:03:48] spoke the word Amen now this bride must
[1:03:50] speak the word in man in this hour
[1:03:51] praise the Lord Amen read revelations
[1:03:54] chapter 10 verse 7 very familiar verse
[1:03:58] to us he says but in the days of the
[1:04:00] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:04:02] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:04:04] be finished as he had declared to his
[1:04:06] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:04:08] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:04:10] again and this is John speaking this go
[1:04:13] and and take the little book this is
[1:04:16] John not saying this part but you know
[1:04:18] what I mean this is in the voice which I
[1:04:21] heard that's John saying that God it
[1:04:23] says from heaven spake unto me again and
[1:04:26] said go and take the little book which
[1:04:28] is open in the hand of the angel which
[1:04:30] standeth upon the sea upon the scene
[1:04:32] upon the earth verse 9 and I went unto
[1:04:34] the angel and said unto him give me the
[1:04:37] little book and he said unto me take it
[1:04:40] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[1:04:42] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:04:44] mouth sweet as honey a man this is what
[1:04:48] we must do with this word amen
[1:04:49] and it's tough to have take the word
[1:04:53] sometimes it's tough to take correction
[1:04:55] sometimes bro-down you're smiling at me
[1:04:59] because you know others is sometimes
[1:05:02] it's tough when the minister sometimes
[1:05:04] is preaching unto us and stumping on our
[1:05:07] feet a man boat you know we need it you
[1:05:12] know and sometimes it's very sweet you
[1:05:15] know when we eat it we this word it's
[1:05:17] sweet to us or we feel so good on Sunday
[1:05:20] but then come Monday a man it's bitter
[1:05:23] when we when it comes time for us to
[1:05:26] manifest this word it's bitter amen then
[1:05:31] some of us you know we aware why is it
[1:05:33] Dale said yesterday amen stay in the
[1:05:39] word yourself and you don't have to
[1:05:41] depend on brother Dale amen verse 10 and
[1:05:45] I took the little book out of the Angels
[1:05:47] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[1:05:49] mouth
[1:05:49] honey and as soon as I had eaten it my
[1:05:51] belly was bitter amen and he said unto
[1:05:55] me thou must prophesy again before many
[1:05:57] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:05:59] kings and we know that John he was a was
[1:06:02] a type of the bride amen
[1:06:04] and so this bride Amen must speak again
[1:06:08] praise God must speak the same word that
[1:06:10] was spoken from the beginning amen
[1:06:13] must need speak to beef must needs to be
[1:06:17] spoken again and this our day amen
[1:06:19] praise God that creative word amen
[1:06:21] praise the Lord Amen praise God so so we
[1:06:30] see that we see that that's the image
[1:06:32] that we need to come to amen
[1:06:33] praise God and finishing and finishing I
[1:06:38] just want to mention this little because
[1:06:41] I'm just seeing the time and I need to
[1:06:43] get to these slides but a couple of
[1:06:47] years ago we were with brother brother
[1:06:50] Joe and brother Bob and and their
[1:06:52] families and we were at the incoming
[1:06:55] Georgia and we went to this little fair
[1:06:58] they have over there and they had this
[1:07:01] little section where there was a wood
[1:07:06] wood amanda was a wood sculptor right
[1:07:11] and he would take piece of log and it
[1:07:15] would take this log and out of it came
[1:07:18] he would with chainsaws he would build a
[1:07:21] make a bear or he would make an eagle or
[1:07:24] he would make you know just different
[1:07:26] things that he had in his mind they
[1:07:28] meant well it was the first time that I
[1:07:30] had actually seen this I knew about this
[1:07:33] but I had never actually seen this taken
[1:07:35] place and so we got there and we sat
[1:07:39] down and there was some some benches
[1:07:41] around there and we sat down and this
[1:07:43] man we see that right before the demand
[1:07:47] actually takes this log he's there
[1:07:50] prepping a man his tools of what he's
[1:07:52] gonna do a man
[1:07:53] praise God he's prepping all his
[1:07:55] chainsaws and he had about six or seven
[1:07:57] chainsaws right there with him laying
[1:07:59] around him all of them different sizes
[1:08:02] sighs teeth and and so he's there
[1:08:06] prepping and putting gas in them and
[1:08:08] putting oil in them amen and so after
[1:08:10] he's done that amen
[1:08:12] he goes into this little cage amen and
[1:08:14] in this cage it's dirty
[1:08:17] amen he's got it's full of woodchips
[1:08:20] everywhere and but that's where he's
[1:08:25] gonna create his masterpiece
[1:08:27] hey man praise God and so I was kind of
[1:08:30] looking at that I'm thinking you know
[1:08:32] that's kind of like well you know God
[1:08:34] amen he puts us in this in this world
[1:08:36] amen and this world is dirty and filthy
[1:08:38] amen the sin amen but that's where he is
[1:08:43] building his body amen praise God in the
[1:08:46] midst of this darkness in the midst of
[1:08:47] this world in the midst of this sin
[1:08:50] infested world this is where he's
[1:08:52] building his body amen praise the Lord
[1:08:55] and so he goes in there and he's
[1:08:57] prepping his tools amen
[1:08:59] after he had prepped his tools and and I
[1:09:01] believe his little chainsaws a man is
[1:09:04] kind of like the thoughtful ministry in
[1:09:05] this heart day amen praise God
[1:09:07] and it's the it's the fivefold ministry
[1:09:09] man that that that that that he's he
[1:09:12] picks up and he takes this piece of
[1:09:16] dirty log first of all and he brings it
[1:09:20] over into this area this work this is
[1:09:22] where he's gonna work at and it's got it
[1:09:25] still has the the bark on it and
[1:09:27] everything I mean this is raw and he
[1:09:29] takes that and sets it on a little
[1:09:32] foundation and and so that he could say
[1:09:36] they can stay steady that way he could
[1:09:38] work on it right and you know that's
[1:09:41] kind of like God when he comes to a man
[1:09:43] and he has to put us on a firm
[1:09:44] foundation first in order to work on us
[1:09:46] right and you know the Bible says stand
[1:09:49] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:09:51] Amen if you don't stand still he won't
[1:09:54] be able to work on you amen
[1:09:55] stand still Amen that way you can see
[1:09:58] the salvation of what God can do in your
[1:10:00] life amen
[1:10:01] but if we're always running and doing
[1:10:02] our own thing trying to do it our own
[1:10:04] way and trying to move for you know God
[1:10:07] can't work with you amen so that log
[1:10:09] sits that he puts that log in there and
[1:10:11] then he takes this big chainsaw and he
[1:10:15] cranks him
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:18] and he starts going at it bleach and
[1:10:20] cutting big pieces up on it hmm
[1:10:24] shrim pieces are flying all over the
[1:10:26] place from one piece over here one piece
[1:10:28] over there and he doesn't care where
[1:10:29] it's flying you know they're just going
[1:10:31] all over the place and he's taken in
[1:10:34] that I believe to me that's kind of like
[1:10:35] the Evangelist that comes in here amen
[1:10:37] and he started cutting in and bringing
[1:10:39] in it doesn't matter where the pieces
[1:10:41] fall amen this thing has to take a
[1:10:43] certain shape amen so that the
[1:10:46] Evangelist comes in and it brings us to
[1:10:49] a place where we can repent amen kind of
[1:10:54] smooth it so that we can get a little
[1:10:56] smooth you know kind of kind of see that
[1:10:59] we have this world still on us that's
[1:11:01] why you needed to cut that bark off you
[1:11:03] know praise God and so so then he comes
[1:11:08] and he brings this other little smaller
[1:11:11] chainsaw and that little chainsaw he
[1:11:14] starts adding a little bit more details
[1:11:15] to the log amen and the people are
[1:11:18] around looking and they're wondering
[1:11:20] what in the world is he creating there
[1:11:22] they're there they're in there wondering
[1:11:26] you know what is this that is going to
[1:11:28] come about this this image that he has
[1:11:30] in mind but the whole time the the
[1:11:32] sculptor he knows what he has in mind
[1:11:34] the whole time amen
[1:11:36] it's a mystery to the world but to God
[1:11:38] it's not a mystery amen you know it's a
[1:11:40] mystery to the world what God is doing
[1:11:42] in our lives because all they see is
[1:11:45] that your sisters wear long hair and
[1:11:47] wear long dresses and you can you know
[1:11:49] act like the world you you met young you
[1:11:51] men you don't act like the world you
[1:11:53] don't smoke you don't drink you don't go
[1:11:54] to the bars and all these things but
[1:11:58] it's God knows exactly what's gonna come
[1:12:01] out of your life amen praise God so he
[1:12:03] takes this other smaller one and it's
[1:12:05] like the pastor and the teacher amen and
[1:12:08] just kind of starts adding a little bit
[1:12:09] more details to it but and you still
[1:12:12] don't see what it is
[1:12:14] amen then he takes this other little
[1:12:16] smaller chainsaw with smaller teeth and
[1:12:18] then and he starts adding a little bit
[1:12:20] more details to it now you see that it's
[1:12:22] oh this is a
[1:12:24] is a bear and you see this bear being
[1:12:27] formed out of this log that you didn't
[1:12:29] think a bear would come out of that log
[1:12:32] but it did a man and so he takes another
[1:12:35] little chainsaw and starts adding a
[1:12:37] little bit more details you know now and
[1:12:39] so he finally gets this this this piece
[1:12:42] of log this bear now because it's hard
[1:12:45] to look at it now that it's a it's just
[1:12:47] a log now to you to to the people around
[1:12:50] that's a bear you see that's a bear
[1:12:53] that's not just a piece of log anymore
[1:12:55] that's a bear
[1:12:56] amen praise God and in the world they
[1:12:59] men when they see that God has really
[1:13:01] done a work in your life a man they're
[1:13:02] gonna see that's a Christian amen
[1:13:04] that really is a a Holy Ghost that's how
[1:13:08] Holy Ghost Christian amen and they might
[1:13:10] want to be like you a man maybe not but
[1:13:14] at least you're giving forth the
[1:13:15] testimony praise God amen and so he was
[1:13:19] finished with this with this piece of
[1:13:21] log and he puts it to the side and it
[1:13:24] looked nice but it finally but what it
[1:13:28] needed it needed some color so he takes
[1:13:30] some spray paint and he starts print
[1:13:33] spraying the this bear now amen and now
[1:13:38] it just looked beautiful a man it was
[1:13:41] like the icing on the cake amen
[1:13:43] praise God and I believe amen you know
[1:13:46] throughout all these ages God is working
[1:13:48] and for making this body amen building
[1:13:51] this body but the icing on the cake a
[1:13:53] man is when that capstone comes they men
[1:13:55] praise the Lord caps this bride amen and
[1:13:58] then she's she'll be just like him amen
[1:14:01] praise the Lord she'll just she look
[1:14:03] just like if she look just exactly like
[1:14:06] the image that he had that sculptor had
[1:14:08] in his mind they met because that
[1:14:10] sculptor that that wood sculptor he
[1:14:12] didn't have just a bland looking bear
[1:14:15] while he had in mind was a bear with
[1:14:17] color amen and so that's what needed to
[1:14:20] come forth and that's why I believe the
[1:14:22] Bride of Christ amen she's gonna become
[1:14:24] in full-color you know in full color
[1:14:27] with that capping of that perfect love
[1:14:29] spray paint with perfect love you see a
[1:14:31] man if you can say it that way praise
[1:14:34] God God's gonna have his way
[1:14:36] and he's gonna he's gonna build his body
[1:14:38] praise Lord in this hour and you know
[1:14:41] Saints what we need to do is we just
[1:14:42] need to give in to what he's doing don't
[1:14:46] don't reason it don't think about it
[1:14:49] your own way
[1:14:50] think about it God's Way look at it
[1:14:54] through God's eyes look at it through
[1:14:56] his word and I believe he'll finish that
[1:14:59] word in you amen he'll finish that that
[1:15:01] that he'll perfect that word in you way
[1:15:03] man praise God
[1:15:06] and brother Branham says here in the
[1:15:14] message because we know Saints in 1st
[1:15:17] Corinthians chapter 13 says verse 9 it
[1:15:21] says for we know in part and we prophesy
[1:15:24] in part but when that which is perfect
[1:15:26] is come then that which is in part shall
[1:15:29] be done away amen
[1:15:31] oh we see things right now in part and
[1:15:34] we don't understand they men how this
[1:15:36] all is gonna unfold the resurrection and
[1:15:40] all these things with we see it in part
[1:15:43] but but all that amen will come a point
[1:15:46] where we're gonna see it in its fullness
[1:15:48] hey man we're gonna realize exactly what
[1:15:51] that word was saying amen it's gonna be
[1:15:54] manifested in our lives
[1:15:55] amen and what kind of rejoicing shall we
[1:15:58] have at that time amen praise the Lord
[1:16:00] when I was a child verse 11 when I was a
[1:16:03] child spake as a child understood as a
[1:16:05] child I thought as a child but when I
[1:16:06] became a man I put away childish things
[1:16:08] for now we see through a glass darkly
[1:16:11] but then face to face now I know in part
[1:16:13] but then shall I know even as also I am
[1:16:17] known
[1:16:17] hey man praise God he knew me amen
[1:16:23] and yet he loved me praise God he had a
[1:16:26] vision of you and me of how he wanted
[1:16:28] this bride to be a man but it was an
[1:16:30] example from it started even from
[1:16:32] Genesis amen amen and it's gonna end up
[1:16:36] the exact same way back to that Genesis
[1:16:38] 1:26 man praise God the Holy Spirit
[1:16:41] working doing the whole work amen in
[1:16:43] this body amen praise the Lord you loved
[1:16:45] the Lord this evening praise God

[1:16:52] real quick
[1:16:55] we'll switch gears now amen
[1:16:59] I hope they they were able to bring them
[1:17:01] up they could bring the first picture up

[1:17:06] possible I hope they got him amen

[1:17:19] you to read that read that message

[1:17:30] masterpiece in this hour amen praise God
[1:17:36] is it come okay
[1:17:39] amen praise the Lord the Hendersons
[1:17:43] doing this I don't know what you meant
[1:17:48] praise the Lord hallelujah but you know
[1:17:53] Saints God is not in a rush you know God
[1:18:02] knows exactly how he you know we think
[1:18:06] that we can correct God I know and that
[1:18:08] we can do it better than God but let me
[1:18:11] tell you what you know you'll fall flat
[1:18:14] on your face and you realize that you're
[1:18:15] not you're not you know you're dependent
[1:18:18] on him amen praise God all right so we
[1:18:21] went to Nicaragua and we were gonna go
[1:18:25] to Honduras
[1:18:26] there's Atlanta Georgia for some of you
[1:18:28] who I know are not good with geography
[1:18:32] Nicaraguan Honduras or in Central
[1:18:35] America this is Mexico this is Columbia
[1:18:40] and
[1:18:45] you're one of those
[1:18:49] we landed in Managua Nicaragua next
[1:18:51] slide it was about three hours three
[1:18:54] hour flight from if you take though from
[1:18:59] Atlanta to Nicaragua it's about three
[1:19:03] and a half hours almost four hours
[1:19:04] flight all right so this is a got there
[1:19:10] and this is brother Alan right here and
[1:19:13] he picked up we got there on a on a
[1:19:15] Wednesday I believe and okay sorry we
[1:19:22] got there on a Wednesday and it was on a
[1:19:26] Wednesday right to you it was a Thursday
[1:19:28] okay
[1:19:29] and spent the night went the first night
[1:19:33] as since we got in so late we were we
[1:19:36] spent the night at a hotel and then a
[1:19:39] brother came and picked us up the next
[1:19:41] day and this is brother Alan and just to
[1:19:43] kind of get of image of what the streets
[1:19:46] of Managua look like they got these
[1:19:47] window washers they come and when you're
[1:19:50] at red lights and they'll come and wash
[1:19:51] your windows and and they don't ask you
[1:19:54] that later they they just come and watch
[1:19:56] the windows okay because you have to tip
[1:19:58] them you know and I'm and they do it out
[1:20:02] all the countries I've been to they do
[1:20:04] that you know so and you got a tip them
[1:20:07] so next slide just play this video a few
[1:20:12] a few seconds of the video open place
[1:20:20] I don't know they had the audio over
[1:20:22] there or not but you know why sharing
[1:20:30] their pizza right there
[1:20:35] as people just gay walking you know I
[1:20:37] kind of middle-of-the-road we got a
[1:20:39] young though next slide kind of like
[1:20:42] looks like kind of like Manila doesn't
[1:20:45] well no manila's worse now this is
[1:20:49] brother Alan who was driving right here
[1:20:51] now brother Alan he's a very wonderful
[1:20:53] brother and he's a minister yeah and
[1:20:56] this is his wife his little girl and
[1:20:59] he's very instrumental have been helping
[1:21:01] me whenever I go down they're just very
[1:21:04] instrumental brother when we go down
[1:21:06] there so next slide this is brother for
[1:21:10] the Carlos and his wife shot on now
[1:21:15] sister Sharon brother Carlos they drove
[1:21:18] us throughout the whole trip from around
[1:21:21] Nicaragua and to Honduras and he's you
[1:21:24] know he's very serviceable but they've
[1:21:27] been trying to have children for the
[1:21:29] they've been married for about four or
[1:21:30] five years I believe four years and they
[1:21:33] haven't been able to have children and
[1:21:34] so right before we left them they took
[1:21:38] us to the airport when we were coming
[1:21:39] back and Christine my wife she she gave
[1:21:43] sister Sharon one of our prayer cloths
[1:21:46] and she she wasn't expecting that and
[1:21:50] she just gave it to her and she was so
[1:21:52] thankful for that you know and so we're
[1:21:54] gonna believe a man that God's gonna
[1:21:56] give him a child next time we were over
[1:21:58] there you know she's either holding the
[1:21:59] child or pregnant with a child amen
[1:22:01] so because they they certainly do
[1:22:04] deserve it amen praise God so next slide
[1:22:06] hmm and so when we this is just it felt
[1:22:16] like a prison this is how you get an
[1:22:19] idea cuz we were in a car when we went
[1:22:21] to Honduras driving and driving around
[1:22:23] Honduras it was a small little car and
[1:22:26] we had one two three four four seat four
[1:22:31] in the back seat and then a little baby
[1:22:33] as well and then another person is
[1:22:35] sitting in the passenger seat and then
[1:22:37] the driver and so of course my wife had
[1:22:39] to sit on my lap so so where I kind of
[1:22:42] crushed there but not too bad
[1:22:48] so next slide
[1:22:51] and so when we this is when we went to
[1:22:53] Honduras and this is there are five-star
[1:22:56] hotel the bathroom and you know just and
[1:23:01] this isn't brother Eric's home and he he
[1:23:05] was just I'll show you a picture of him
[1:23:07] in just a moment but there there just
[1:23:10] ate everything they have they're just
[1:23:12] willing to share it with you you know
[1:23:13] and so you can't be picky you know most
[1:23:18] of the time the water wouldn't come out
[1:23:20] of that so you'd have to take water in a
[1:23:22] bucket from outside and I would just
[1:23:25] bathe with it you know it had sand and
[1:23:28] maybe little wiggle tails in it but you
[1:23:30] still have to bathe in it not so brush
[1:23:34] your teeth with it and everything next
[1:23:37] slide now this is well this is called a
[1:23:40] Bella Annabella what it is is it stores
[1:23:43] water for them this is rain water and
[1:23:45] they do all their cooking I mean they
[1:23:48] wash their pots and things they do their
[1:23:50] laundry with it and you see some laundry
[1:23:52] right here and m'as in there and they
[1:23:57] have a whole system that goes around the
[1:23:59] house that gives them water through this
[1:24:01] through this right here
[1:24:03] so if next slide I believe it's just a
[1:24:06] it's a little video that my wife
[1:24:08] Christine took now I I give credit to my
[1:24:11] wife for all these videos and all these
[1:24:14] pictures save a place here real quick
[1:24:21] this is Honduras now yes we were only in
[1:24:25] Nicaragua for what happened is we needed
[1:24:28] to be in in in in Honduras I don't know
[1:24:31] if it's gonna play or not
[1:24:34] all right anyway let's just go to next
[1:24:36] slide all right and I was saying I'll
[1:24:40] give my wife credit because you know but
[1:24:43] there the weight was saying you know
[1:24:45] some people may ask why you take your
[1:24:46] wife well my wife usually has never gone
[1:24:49] to any of the mission trips with me and
[1:24:51] I really wanted to take her this time
[1:24:55] with me and so but she was very
[1:24:59] instrumental because you know for a
[1:25:01] minister
[1:25:01] sometimes you have to be dealing with
[1:25:03] the ministers and in the people and you
[1:25:07] don't have time to to to to take
[1:25:09] pictures and to you know to write things
[1:25:11] down you know in an agenda what has been
[1:25:14] done well my wife was right there and
[1:25:15] she was taking care of all that you know
[1:25:17] not only that but as brother Wade was
[1:25:19] mentioning Sunday you know she was she
[1:25:21] was able to deal with the with the
[1:25:23] sisters over there in the way that I
[1:25:24] couldn't deal with them you see talking
[1:25:26] with them and being a benefit to them
[1:25:28] you know I I wasn't thinking about
[1:25:30] giving that sister uh a prayer cloth you
[1:25:34] know but my wife had that idea and she
[1:25:37] told me afterwards that she did that you
[1:25:39] see so we're helping each other out man
[1:25:42] praise God
[1:25:42] a man so there's benefits to having your
[1:25:44] wife there with you man praise the Lord
[1:25:47] so brother brother Eric gallo he is the
[1:25:52] brother that we helped a couple of about
[1:25:55] a year ago send some funds there in
[1:25:57] Honduras to help build a church that
[1:26:00] they have started over there because
[1:26:03] right now the group that he's
[1:26:05] ministering to is is just meeting at a
[1:26:10] home and so this is the church that we
[1:26:13] started we helped by the foundational
[1:26:16] part of it and this this rule bar I
[1:26:19] think is what it's called Reba Reba Reba
[1:26:22] okay rutabaga but this is uh this is
[1:26:30] what they progressed to and just about
[1:26:32] two nights ago he sent me some updated
[1:26:35] images and this is board built out you
[1:26:37] know this is the church this is gonna be
[1:26:39] the little meditation room for the
[1:26:42] pastor in this area and so while we were
[1:26:46] there
[1:26:46] you know the funds that we accumulated
[1:26:48] that you all gave we gave them more
[1:26:52] money to help with this with this out of
[1:26:54] those funds and so so I'm sure that I'm
[1:27:00] hoping that that will help them out more
[1:27:02] and I know it will but so the next slide
[1:27:07] this is another part of the church next
[1:27:09] slide it's just in the middle of nowhere
[1:27:11] real quick let's save this video plays
[1:27:20] this is the this is the church brother
[1:27:26] and this isn't an area and in Honduras
[1:27:31] called Agua Blanca you move nowhere
[1:27:33] which means when white white water you
[1:27:36] know they now saint called
[1:27:43] oh well Blanco which means white one
[1:27:45] there was a schedule that was given
[1:27:47] there was that they had put me to
[1:27:49] minister at certain churches even at a
[1:27:51] church in Nicaragua before we left knee
[1:27:52] cry were to go to Honduras but at this
[1:27:55] time Honduras was going through some
[1:27:57] political crisis at the moment they had
[1:28:00] they had just had the elections take
[1:28:02] place and the the the president that was
[1:28:06] there and you can go to the next slide
[1:28:10] this is this is just you're in the
[1:28:14] middle of cow herd and everywhere just
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:26] nextslide alright now this is brother
[1:28:30] Eric the pastor there that took us in
[1:28:33] Old Town but as I was saying so they
[1:28:36] were going through a political crisis
[1:28:37] during that time and so they when the
[1:28:41] one of the brothers that called me up
[1:28:43] and said brother listen you're probably
[1:28:45] gonna have to come to Honduras quicker
[1:28:47] than what you were expected to because
[1:28:49] we don't know what's gonna happen when
[1:28:51] you come here because there was there
[1:28:53] was riots taking place all throughout
[1:28:55] the country because of the president
[1:28:58] that got reelected again and it looks
[1:29:01] like that he reelected himself and and
[1:29:05] so the people were mad and so there was
[1:29:09] a political thing going on and so it
[1:29:11] really hindered us from being able to go
[1:29:13] to all the places that we needed to go
[1:29:15] there was one time when we were leaving
[1:29:17] Honduras and we were coming back into
[1:29:20] Nicaragua that if we had left maybe
[1:29:24] about two hours later they had shut down
[1:29:26] the border and we would not have been
[1:29:28] able to come back to Nicaragua Nicaragua
[1:29:31] is where our flight back to Atlanta was
[1:29:32] was gonna be so God had things in
[1:29:35] control a man but we went through
[1:29:37] several areas in the capital where they
[1:29:39] were burning tires they were you know
[1:29:44] just manifestations you know taking
[1:29:46] place police and things like that we're
[1:29:48] out so it was very things were very uh
[1:29:53] yeah
[1:29:54] very tense yes so that that this was
[1:29:58] that Sunday we were with brother Eric
[1:30:04] and we were going to his church to
[1:30:06] minister and so you go to the next slide
[1:30:10] just get a little idea of what the area
[1:30:13] in that in that area looks like that
[1:30:16] Lanka is the name of that town and it's
[1:30:18] there in Honduras next slide
[1:30:23] just real quick save that video place
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:40] [Laughter]
[1:30:42] you know it's so funny to be with them
[1:30:45] because you know they may not have much
[1:30:46] what in this truck that we're riding in
[1:30:50] I'm in it's 1997 bald tires and you'll
[1:30:56] see some of the terrain that we went
[1:30:58] through then this brother Eric drives to
[1:31:01] this place it's about 45 minutes to
[1:31:04] church but what he has to go through to
[1:31:07] get there you know and what this poor
[1:31:09] truck indoors I can't believe it's
[1:31:11] lasted that long to get there
[1:31:13] they told me they said you know don't
[1:31:17] worry don't worry if you need to worry
[1:31:20] if you don't hear nothing in the in the
[1:31:22] truck if if everything is silent that's
[1:31:24] when you need to worry because
[1:31:25] everything was rattling there's the
[1:31:27] truck right here everything was rattling
[1:31:31] everything was and it was one point when
[1:31:33] at the the day when they shaved which
[1:31:36] was that Saturday they should when I
[1:31:38] took the video there of their church
[1:31:39] that they were building and all that the
[1:31:42] radiator went out and the brothers that
[1:31:45] we were there with and they they they
[1:31:48] got it going it took a few hours but
[1:31:50] they got it back up and going you know
[1:31:51] they had to they just know how to do
[1:31:53] things you know they don't have
[1:31:56] everything available at their display
[1:31:57] there's no autozone everywhere nothing
[1:31:59] like that
[1:32:00] they just use some soap and other things
[1:32:03] and they got the thing going so next
[1:32:07] slide this is brother brother LEL Eli
[1:32:16] and he's a minister he's an evangelist
[1:32:18] he's a this is a pastor I forget his his
[1:32:21] name but he's about from two hours from
[1:32:23] the area where we were at we were going
[1:32:25] to church that morning next slide
[1:32:27] hmmm this is brother Ellie next slide my
[1:32:32] brother Ellie just got married about two
[1:32:34] or three weeks ago so he's about 29
[1:32:37] years old
[1:32:38] just you can kind of get an idea some of
[1:32:42] the terrain does this is the good part
[1:32:46] you know this is them going to church
[1:32:49] every every Wednesday every Sunday and
[1:32:58] you know Saints brother Eddie you know
[1:33:02] he I really I'm praying that he'd be
[1:33:08] able to get another vehicle so because
[1:33:10] he were he it really needs it and uh
[1:33:13] maybe that might be something that we
[1:33:15] can pray about maybe next time that we
[1:33:17] go might be helping him with a little
[1:33:19] offering or something because he
[1:33:23] certainly needs this amen
[1:33:25] and then we got to this point where he
[1:33:28] needed to cross this little River area
[1:33:31] and and so it still has a four wheel at
[1:33:38] four-wheel drive so he kicks it on
[1:33:41] four-wheel drive and and here we go
[1:33:45] going through the river engine
[1:34:01] we made it
[1:34:06] all right
[1:34:08] next slide all right I don't remember
[1:34:11] this sister's name but but she was very
[1:34:17] with she was very special because the
[1:34:19] sister she walks about a mile and a half
[1:34:22] to church and she's held 87 years old so
[1:34:30] and she goes to church and walks to
[1:34:34] church next slide
[1:34:37] she's very active she sings now they
[1:34:41] could turn up the volume on this one
[1:34:43] this is our sister Maria where their
[1:34:58] sister Maria is sending greetings to all
[1:35:01] of you to all those that believe this
[1:35:04] precious message and she wanted to send
[1:35:08] the personal green this is her house is
[1:35:09] where where they're holding meetings
[1:35:11] right the the services right now until
[1:35:13] they get to church and this is I was
[1:35:20] preaching to them about the the vine and
[1:35:24] the branches but we really enjoyed that

[1:35:36] they don't have a room
[1:35:38] they're outside children Sunday School
[1:35:42] class next slide and so they turned this
[1:35:50] one up
[1:35:53] they said god bless you sister Christine
[1:35:59] was out there with them because while
[1:36:01] while they were they could pause it
[1:36:02] while they were out there while I was
[1:36:05] preaching they were having their Sunday
[1:36:07] school and so my wife was teaching them
[1:36:10] how to say god bless you and you know in
[1:36:12] English and so they came in and gave
[1:36:14] their special after the preaching and
[1:36:16] they gave a little song special and then
[1:36:18] they they said they wanted to say god
[1:36:20] bless you amen

[1:41:55] dinner with them and then at 12 we had
[1:41:57] to be at the airport because it was a

[1:42:03] okay just thank God for His guidance
[1:42:05] amen praise the Lord so
[1:42:11] again Saints there was about you know
[1:42:14] because I told the brothers before we
[1:42:16] went over that I said brothers scheduled
[1:42:18] me as much as you can because I just
[1:42:20] want to redeem the time while I'm there
[1:42:21] but being that they had that political
[1:42:24] crisis and all that going on it was very
[1:42:27] limited to how much I could could have
[1:42:29] ministered so so maybe next time we owe
