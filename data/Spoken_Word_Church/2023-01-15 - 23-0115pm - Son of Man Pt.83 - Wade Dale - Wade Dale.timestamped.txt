[0:26] that's the grace that is the grace oh my
[0:30] praise the lord I can't help but to
[0:32] think about what God has done in my life
[0:33] and I hope you're thinking about what

[0:47] saved her you know and changed her life
[0:50] and she could see this message you know
[0:52] my dad he didn't want me to be with
[0:54] somebody like that he said that because

[14:54] keep praying
[14:55] God
[14:57] I was telling him last night when we
[14:58] were praying for the you if you look
[15:00] walk in that room and you look at that
[15:02] gentleman laying in the bed with
[15:05] what 20
[15:07] tubes
[15:09] sticking in different places all over
[15:11] him
[15:12] that don't mean one thing to God
[15:15] not one thing to God that doesn't mean I
[15:19] you know we've seen it we've seen it
[15:21] worse we've seen him almost dead and
[15:23] they'd be brought back to life so that
[15:26] doesn't mean anything to God and it
[15:27] shouldn't mean anything to your faith we
[15:28] need to look past that
[15:30] look past that to where that God can
[15:32] heal
[15:33] in a in a moment or he can heal over
[15:36] time doesn't matter he's still the
[15:38] Healer
[15:39] and we appreciate God for being the
[15:41] Healer because man I tell you what
[15:44] as I get older and be 63 in a few days
[15:47] uh yeah
[15:49] even come quickly Lord Jesus
[15:52] I'm telling you
[15:53] yeah it's it's uh the effects of the
[15:57] curse
[15:57] is on all of us so um and you young ones
[16:01] you'll realize that Esther's going what
[16:03] is he talking about ask your mama
[16:07] as she dated when he gets back and tries
[16:09] and wants to sleep for about three days
[16:11] and you tell him he tells you to leave
[16:12] him alone because he's tired yeah
[16:14] that'll be the effects of the curse
[16:17] but you know what we're here I thought
[16:19] to break the effects of the curse
[16:21] so there's a provision somewhere in here
[16:24] in this message of the hour that's going
[16:27] to break that curse it's going to break
[16:28] that cycle of life and death life and
[16:30] death life and death because I thought
[16:32] we've already passed from Death unto
[16:34] life if we've already passed from Death
[16:36] under life we've already passed it all
[16:38] right so let's just realize that that
[16:40] that's what God's wanting to get us to
[16:41] see now and what we're talking about in
[16:43] this
[16:44] uh series on the son of man so let's uh
[16:47] let's go to the Lord in prayer I think
[16:48] that's all the announcements for right
[16:50] now uh we will be having Bible study
[16:52] this next month in February
[16:54] uh the first Saturday
[16:56] and then communion the first Sunday so
[16:58] let's go to the Lord in prayer
[17:00] Lord thank you for the day that you've
[17:01] given us
[17:03] we love you father for the things that
[17:05] you've given us Lord sometimes we don't
[17:06] sit and
[17:07] and think maybe sometimes we ought to go
[17:10] as one of the prophets did and go sit
[17:12] under a tree and just let you speak to
[17:14] Lord that still small voice
[17:17] spoke to Elijah Lord
[17:19] speak to us today Father
[17:21] let it be a still Small Voice way down
[17:24] deep inside where Satan can't get to it
[17:26] and Lord just tell us of the goodness
[17:29] and tell us of the promises that you've
[17:32] given to your bride
[17:34] Lord I pray this should be the ones that
[17:35] are sick father the ones that are sin
[17:38] sick Lord I pray that you should touch
[17:40] their soul lord light a fire under them
[17:42] Lord now I pray that you light a fire
[17:44] under us Lord that you'll Lord there be
[17:47] a Revival start out of Revelation and
[17:49] and Lord today we'll talk about
[17:51] knowledge father the knowledge of the
[17:54] Lord will fill the Earth to seeing Sky
[17:57] father you're so much greater than any
[17:59] scientist we we hold people in in up on
[18:03] pedestals as as we say on Earth as
[18:06] Einstein and and all the different ones
[18:08] that that have seemingly broke into the
[18:12] great Realms of science but Lord Jesus
[18:15] we know the one that created signs Lord
[18:18] the one that created all these things is
[18:20] living inside of us today now Lord I
[18:22] pray that just for a moment that we'll
[18:24] you'll break back our humanity and that
[18:27] you'll let us Lord see you in a moment
[18:31] because one moment in your presence is
[18:34] better than anything in this world has
[18:36] to offer
[18:37] father we pray that you just bless us
[18:39] now take care of us in the furtherness
[18:40] service Jesus name we pray
[18:43] amen
[18:44] all right let's continue where we were
[18:47] at this morning we'll skip a little bit
[18:48] through there uh to get to I want to get
[18:51] to knowledge this will be part 84 in the
[18:54] beginning was the word the word was with
[18:55] God the Word was God and the Word was
[18:58] made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[19:00] so that that makes it personal
[19:03] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[19:05] Us Among Us
[19:06] all right because I'm gonna read the
[19:07] scripture that I read this morning and
[19:09] it seemed more real to me today than it
[19:11] did yesterday a few minutes ago than it
[19:13] did this morning
[19:15] Joel said I will restore unto you
[19:20] I never read it like that before you
[19:21] said boy preacher you're kind of well
[19:23] I'm a little slow
[19:24] I'm a little slow but he said I were
[19:26] restoring to you just like he said in
[19:27] Malachi 4 I behold I will send you
[19:30] Elijah the prophet so he's going to
[19:33] restore me
[19:34] I will restore you to you all these
[19:37] things so we're going to have a
[19:38] restoration brother Brown preach the
[19:40] restoration of the Bride tree and that's
[19:42] what we're looking at really the
[19:43] restoration the bright bright tree was a
[19:45] kind of a uh overlapping of the Statue
[19:48] of perfect man so the word was made
[19:50] flesh and talked among us and we beheld
[19:51] his glory
[19:52] to glory of the only begotten of the
[19:54] father full of grace and truth you can
[19:55] go and be seated in the Lord had his
[19:57] blessings
[19:58] to the reading of the word we were
[19:59] talking about this morning
[20:01] we'll just cover a little bit more about
[20:03] this about adoption I hope that we see
[20:07] that
[20:08] that adoption is not your birth
[20:11] adoption is your placing so it's two
[20:13] different things but they connect
[20:16] everybody with me now I want you
[20:18] starting sleeping already take everybody
[20:20] get a fan
[20:21] there you go everybody get a fan and we
[20:23] know you fall asleep when your fan goes
[20:25] flying out of your hand
[20:27] so
[20:28] and then it hits your neighbor wakes
[20:30] them up and you see if they have
[20:31] brotherly kindness or not
[20:33] what a way to do it
[20:35] thank you Richard brother Aaron's not
[20:37] here to do it so you can stand in for
[20:39] your brother
[20:40] yeah thank you brother Richard
[20:42] thank you brother Richard
[20:46] he can play a bass but he can he can
[20:48] sure work that thing right there too
[20:51] all right Genesis 2 8 we're going to
[20:52] talk about knowledge we're going to talk
[20:54] about two types of knowledge we've been
[20:55] wanting to get to it for a long period
[20:57] of time and out of the ground made the
[20:58] Lord to grow every tree talking about
[21:00] regular botany life but now he's talking
[21:03] about a tree of life in the midst of the
[21:05] Garden or the metal or as we were
[21:08] looking at on that chart as the center
[21:10] that's where God Wants to Rule he wants
[21:12] to rule the center he wants to be the
[21:14] center of your life
[21:16] he wants his life to be in the center of
[21:18] your life all right he does not want you
[21:20] just to have an anointing or do you have
[21:22] feel good or or or or I uh you know I I
[21:25] believe that up to a point that's not
[21:27] the way he wants he doesn't want us to
[21:28] believe it up to a point he wants to
[21:30] believe every word of God that
[21:31] proceedeth out of his mouth but there
[21:34] had to be a tree of knowledge of good
[21:35] and evil brother by him one time he
[21:37] called him he said it was the law of
[21:39] contrast
[21:41] because remember without
[21:42] Darkness
[21:44] light
[21:46] you wouldn't know what the difference
[21:48] was but then if you bring light in
[21:50] darkness goes away if you bring darkness
[21:52] in then that means there's not light
[21:53] there so there has to be a contrast that
[21:55] has to be good and evil because remember
[21:57] this tree
[21:59] of knowledge has good and evil both on
[22:01] it
[22:02] all right that tree of life doesn't deal
[22:05] with knowledge as man's knowledge this
[22:08] is in man's knowledge because listen to
[22:10] be honest Satan does not have he has
[22:14] knowledge but he doesn't have Holy Ghost
[22:16] knowledge
[22:18] okay he does he can't because he don't
[22:20] have the Holy Ghost he has an anointing
[22:22] knowledge he has a knowledge that he can
[22:25] make you do things he can make the world
[22:28] do things he can have the world make
[22:30] what make plastic
[22:32] uh when I was growing up there wasn't
[22:33] such thing as plastic bottles
[22:38] they couldn't make them there was no way
[22:40] to make them back then now look they
[22:43] made billions of these things all the
[22:44] time now and they just pour water in it
[22:47] and make every they have that uh
[22:49] um I can't remember but it's called some
[22:51] kind of mold but it makes they make any
[22:53] kind if you if you can make a mold for
[22:54] it they can make something but see that
[22:57] wasn't back in the 60s it was all what
[22:59] 10 cans
[23:01] you know what we used to kick the tin
[23:03] can I wonder what we're about to do what
[23:04] we do if we had to kick the plastic cup
[23:07] don't kick them very far but man you
[23:09] kick a can you kick it from here to the
[23:10] door if you if you needed to but that
[23:12] was because everything was made with tin
[23:14] cans well man came to a knowledge of the
[23:17] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and
[23:19] he began to say hey I think I can make
[23:22] them old that will hold water
[23:24] I think I can make a mold I know Donnie
[23:26] does and I remember it too
[23:28] all of our cars man 55 56 57 Chevrolets
[23:32] and different things like that they
[23:33] didn't have any plastic in them
[23:36] metal
[23:37] everything was metal door handles knobs
[23:41] it was all mental why they didn't have
[23:43] the technology to make the plastic mold
[23:47] injection molding that's what I was
[23:48] trying to think of injection molding
[23:50] came along and now they can mold
[23:52] anything well let's go a little higher
[23:54] than that now man has done what he has
[23:56] now took a computer along with a printer
[23:59] and instead of printing stuff flat they
[24:02] printed 3D
[24:04] Josh has got a couple of them that's
[24:06] what he made the little statue of
[24:07] perfect man thing that he gave us it's a
[24:09] three-dimensional printer they took the
[24:11] same printer that we have that gives us
[24:13] flat copies and it makes whatever they
[24:15] make guns well those things now
[24:19] but now remember there's nothing new
[24:21] Under the Sun
[24:23] the computer was back in the Garden of
[24:25] Eden the car was back in the Garden of
[24:27] Eden and Jackson molding was back in the
[24:29] Garden of Eden because the plastic was
[24:30] back there it was just in minerals but
[24:33] what did it take it took man to do what
[24:35] bring that back together
[24:38] bring it together in another form and
[24:41] make a car and then he now he makes a
[24:43] car that used to weigh what the old cars
[24:45] used to weigh 95 000 pounds something
[24:47] like that
[24:48] well they weigh now about 2500. well
[24:50] they don't weigh much I mean even you
[24:52] come into aluminum you got aluminum
[24:54] Motors now you got aluminum list and you
[24:56] got all these things that are that are
[24:58] enhancing our life but remember this
[25:02] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what
[25:04] we eat off of it kills us
[25:07] the more cars we put on the road the
[25:09] more chance you got to have a wreck
[25:12] the more guns they make the more chance
[25:13] you got to get killed
[25:17] and they make some vicious stuff now for
[25:20] war that you really don't want to be
[25:21] around here when they are unleash all
[25:23] that stuff that they're going to unleash
[25:25] you don't want to be here
[25:27] well
[25:28] it came from the Tree of knowledge of
[25:30] Good and Evil because man thinks he can
[25:32] get smart enough that he can survive
[25:34] that these billionaires can build these
[25:36] bunkers so they can why do you think all
[25:38] these rich folks are trying to get to
[25:40] Mars and trying to get to to the Moon
[25:43] they want to escape what's going to
[25:44] happen here
[25:46] they want to be able to have just a
[25:47] little sliver of Hope and be able to go
[25:49] to another world where God told us to a
[25:53] prophet that you got enough inside of
[25:55] you right now
[25:56] to go build a whole world and go live on
[26:00] it yet we want to lean to well we'll
[26:04] just we might can make it if we get to
[26:05] Mars yeah well you'll be about 500 years
[26:08] old when you get there so it's not going
[26:09] to be worth it anyway man's still going
[26:12] to get older you know then people are
[26:13] I'm sure that and and you know I was
[26:16] thinking the other day all the great
[26:17] people that's live but you take somebody
[26:19] like Steve Jobs that created Apple
[26:22] he spent billions of dollars to try to
[26:24] live just one more month
[26:27] to try to live just one more moment
[26:29] didn't do my bit of good
[26:31] he's still got whatever it was colon
[26:33] cancer or something and he passed away
[26:35] just
[26:36] wither to nothing but he tried man has
[26:39] tried and tried and tried to live
[26:42] forever when the whole the whole uh plan
[26:46] of God is is for us to live Eternal we
[26:50] had to start living like this but the
[26:51] whole plan the whole knowledge of God is
[26:53] is that we're going to live eat for an
[26:55] eternity if you have the new birth today
[26:57] you're definitely gonna you don't need a
[26:59] spaceship
[27:00] you don't need to create something and
[27:02] get in it and no you already got it
[27:05] God gave it to you when he put it your
[27:07] mom and daddy together brought you put a
[27:09] soul in there you made a choice God put
[27:11] his soul in now you're going to heaven
[27:13] now that is too simple no bro wait we
[27:18] need to take vitamins it's all right I
[27:19] take vitamins it's okay take vitamins
[27:21] don't think it's not it's good because
[27:23] you know what this junk that we eat now
[27:25] don't have a lot of vitamins in it all
[27:27] right but we want to be like everybody
[27:30] wants to be like you know we want to be
[27:31] like the children of Israel where the
[27:33] where they it's quoted in and it's not
[27:35] in the Bible but it's quoted in in
[27:37] Jewish uh lore that there was no
[27:41] bathrooms in the 40-year journey because
[27:43] what they ate which was Manna it became
[27:46] part of them absorbed in their body and
[27:47] they didn't have to use didn't have any
[27:49] waste well that's okay that's fine with
[27:51] me but I promise you one thing when Adam
[27:53] and Eve was in the Garden of Eden before
[27:54] the fall they didn't need it either
[27:56] what they ate was perfect that's what
[27:58] we're going back to we're going back to
[28:00] where we don't need a place that we need
[28:02] to have a restroom amen we don't need to
[28:05] have a place where we think we need we
[28:07] need you know we need to uh tissue to
[28:09] blow our nose and all this stuff I was
[28:10] thinking the other day if you just
[28:12] really just sat down and wrote uh wrote
[28:15] what we not going to need when we get to
[28:17] heaven
[28:21] try that
[28:24] I know me and Mom have sinus problems
[28:26] and I thought praise God I don't have to
[28:28] feel like I got a lump sticking in my
[28:30] throat 99 of the time I don't have to
[28:32] wake up hacking every time I won't have
[28:34] to even wake up so we gotta we can just
[28:35] do away with that nothing to do with
[28:38] sleep so we can do away with that
[28:40] nothing to do with work we can do away
[28:42] with that nothing to do with financing
[28:44] sorry bro John we don't have anything to
[28:46] do with that but the Bible says build up
[28:48] you treasure what not here
[28:51] but in heaven and I sure appreciate what
[28:53] he's doing too because we really do need
[28:55] to be good stewards of our money uh
[28:57] regardless of whether we have it or not
[29:00] God give it to us and we need to be good
[29:02] stewards of what any we you know the
[29:04] lady with the two mites
[29:06] she was a good Steward of what she had
[29:09] she had two minds
[29:11] she didn't have nothing she had too much
[29:13] she gave it all to God but she did have
[29:15] two mites and it's a good good story to
[29:19] see that
[29:20] and that brother John would bring it to
[29:22] us and we sure do appreciate him him
[29:24] standing in and doing it he could do it
[29:26] more often if he wanted to Isaiah 28
[29:29] verse 9. Whom Shall he teach knowledge
[29:31] and Whom Shall he make to understand
[29:33] Doctrine who them that are weaned from
[29:36] the milk and drawn from the breast so
[29:37] who's he going to teach knowledge babies
[29:39] not so much uh it's talking to some
[29:42] people at work the other day and they
[29:43] were their their baby was a year old
[29:45] first Christmas you know well what are
[29:47] we going to get them I said it don't
[29:49] matter
[29:55] years
[29:57] for the first five years buy your kids
[29:59] gifts don't throw them away buying for
[30:02] Christmas then when they turn six take
[30:04] their toy box and turn it upside down
[30:07] and take them same thing and give it to
[30:09] them and they'll think it's just a brand
[30:10] new toy
[30:11] Jonas is like no no no
[30:16] but that's the way we are though see we
[30:18] become smart we become intelligent I
[30:22] don't want that I want the intelligence
[30:23] intelligence of God I want this one
[30:25] Isaiah said whom
[30:27] Whom Shall he teach knowledge me
[30:30] and Whom Shall he make to understand
[30:32] Doctrine me
[30:34] them that are weaned from the milk and
[30:37] drawn from the breast Isaiah 53 10 by
[30:40] his knowledge shall my righteous servant
[30:42] justify many
[30:43] think about a man that that never went
[30:46] to school
[30:47] he shows up
[30:48] and to see a Galilee and he shows up in
[30:51] the Nazareth and he shows up over here
[30:52] you know like brother Brown said he
[30:54] don't have a school of divinity you
[30:56] don't have all these degrees and he
[30:57] shows up and they say something to him
[31:00] and he just the Bible says he says
[31:02] things and they don't have nothing else
[31:03] to say back to him
[31:04] he confounds the scholars even at 13
[31:08] years old they were what they were
[31:09] confounded by the things that he said
[31:11] even at 13 years old why because he was
[31:14] God Almighty and human flesh but you and
[31:16] I should have the same thing in our in
[31:19] our mind
[31:20] the Bible tells us
[31:24] what do we do we study we're gonna we're
[31:27] gonna go to court tomorrow we're going
[31:28] to study we gotta go do the Bible tells
[31:31] you not even to study
[31:34] right
[31:36] go and I'll put in your mouth
[31:40] boy how many of us want to depend on
[31:41] that
[31:42] don't raise your hand because you ain't
[31:44] to the point yet neither am I
[31:46] I want to study these things out I want
[31:48] to figure out what I'm talking about no
[31:50] God said don't do that because you know
[31:52] what we do we figure things out our way
[31:57] that's why I'll read your scripture in a
[31:58] few minutes where the Lord Jesus said
[32:00] lean not on your own understanding
[32:04] lean not to your own understanding but
[32:06] use the what the knowledge of God this
[32:09] part of knowledge to me is so very
[32:11] important it's right down there to
[32:13] bottom it's really wide you and I have
[32:16] got to come to a knowledge
[32:18] of the truth
[32:21] not just like they come to acknowledge
[32:23] of the truth and say well that's false
[32:25] we become that knowledge of that truth
[32:28] because we're going to see in just a few
[32:30] minutes that God is going to put a
[32:32] spirit of wisdom in the church
[32:35] not in the world they're going to put a
[32:37] spirit of wisdom in the church through
[32:39] Apostles prophets pastors teachings
[32:41] evangelists that's just the way I see it
[32:42] deacons Elders in different ones that
[32:45] he's going to give us knowledge
[32:47] everybody wants all these different
[32:49] gifts there is a gift of knowledge
[32:52] all right
[32:53] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[32:56] servant justify me for he shall bear my
[32:59] iniquity
[33:00] now we talked about this morning we
[33:02] don't have to pull the chart up we'll
[33:03] get through this real quick because I
[33:05] believe everybody understands what
[33:06] sanctification is that's what's
[33:08] happening now we are we are by the word
[33:11] of God we are going to see that we that
[33:15] Spirit realm is swept and garnished that
[33:17] that Spirit realm is where the unclean
[33:20] spirit is being able to try to move in
[33:22] because you can't get your soul if
[33:24] you're born again if you can't get your
[33:26] soul he's going to try and fight and
[33:27] fight and fight to get back in where he
[33:29] was at
[33:31] but you know what we're gonna fight
[33:33] fight not let him back in
[33:35] all right so sanctification is clean and
[33:37] set aside for service and remember when
[33:39] you look at sanctification
[33:41] that is signified by what read
[33:45] so it's pretty bloody it's not just real
[33:47] clean something it's sanctification is
[33:49] the red what what cleans you the blood
[33:53] of Jesus Christ is what cleans you up
[33:56] and keeps you clean all right so it's a
[33:58] messy thing and it is to all of us I
[34:01] hope we see that we're going through
[34:03] that process again Lord tear the rest of
[34:06] the things out Lord come into my house
[34:08] and not just not just put a new door in
[34:12] with a doorknob on both sides where he
[34:14] can get in when he wants to
[34:16] but come on into my
[34:19] living room
[34:21] come on into my kitchen come on into my
[34:23] bedroom
[34:24] tell me what needs to be cleaned out get
[34:27] in the corners get in the crevices
[34:29] do like that woman that lost her bees
[34:31] you know if during that time in in the
[34:34] in the Old Country they would wear beads
[34:37] and it would signify different things
[34:38] well if you lost one of them it was
[34:40] either you were a prostitute or you lost
[34:42] your husband well she lost remember one
[34:44] of her one of her little medallions and
[34:48] she searched a whole place and finally
[34:49] found it she I don't believe she just
[34:52] said I ain't worried about it I'll go to
[34:53] church when I need to
[34:57] I'm sorry go church when I wanted
[35:00] no
[35:03] cranny every place she looked for that
[35:07] coin and you know what she found it and
[35:09] she put that thing back on to restore
[35:12] her back you and I listen we're gonna
[35:15] fall we're gonna fail we're going to do
[35:18] wrong
[35:19] but let's pray to God that our doing
[35:21] wrong is not so close together
[35:24] right
[35:25] yeah I mean you know if you keep doing
[35:28] the same thing what's the what's the uh
[35:30] definition of insanity
[35:32] doing the same thing over and over
[35:34] expecting a different result no you're
[35:37] gonna get the same results every time
[35:39] amen and the worst thing you can do
[35:43] is to separate yourself if you're having
[35:46] trouble don't separate yourself from
[35:48] church folks from from believers
[35:51] don't do that
[35:53] you cannot and will not you will always
[35:56] fail
[35:57] we are sheep we're herd animals we need
[36:00] to be together we need to be able to
[36:01] Crown each other's shoulder and say did
[36:04] you go through this like yes I went
[36:05] through that and this is what I did this
[36:08] is what God did for me to help me in
[36:10] this journey all right
[36:12] listen folks we don't need to keep our
[36:14] secrets to ourselves
[36:16] we need to tell others
[36:18] brother Bob said tell how your fire got
[36:19] lit right if you can't do anything
[36:21] testify to somebody hey I used to be a
[36:24] drunk I used to be smoking a lot but
[36:26] there's not any different ones I used to
[36:28] smoke I couldn't I couldn't help myself
[36:29] well that's right you didn't help
[36:31] yourself you let God help yourself
[36:33] when you let God help yourself you quit
[36:35] doing the things that you used to do
[36:37] amen
[36:39] but what is this whole thing this whole
[36:42] all these virtues is summed up in this
[36:44] one quote brother man said right here
[36:46] being obedient to what God Said
[36:51] it's what brought the powers what's
[36:53] going to bring you power what brought
[36:55] virtue is obedience to the word of God
[37:00] and remember obedience is better than
[37:02] sacrifice oh you know like I said about
[37:05] the brother that said well I'm just
[37:06] going to work on Sundays and that whole
[37:08] Sunday that whole day I'm gonna work and
[37:12] get Triple time and uh it's gonna be
[37:14] hundreds of dollars and I'm gonna give
[37:16] it all to the mission field
[37:18] well he did not succeed very long in
[37:21] doing that
[37:22] he actually quit the church for a while
[37:24] and got in some bad shape and he's doing
[37:27] better now because you know what he
[37:29] changed his mind
[37:30] well I hope God's going to change his
[37:32] mind but he's now coming back to church
[37:34] and I hope he doesn't do that anymore
[37:36] because that wasn't for God but now it
[37:39] sounded good
[37:40] that did it not it sounded good hey if I
[37:43] work Sunday you can just see somebody
[37:44] you know the devil's sitting on your
[37:46] shoulder said yeah I feel I don't worry
[37:48] about going to church if you'll you'll
[37:49] get paid triple time because a lot of
[37:51] places pray you know time and a half for
[37:52] overtime and double time for for Sunday
[37:54] work so he'll get paid double
[37:57] and then I'll just give it all the
[37:58] missions
[38:01] that ain't what God wants that's not
[38:03] what he said to do because if you put
[38:05] God first and all these other things if
[38:07] he said that on Saturday maybe that
[38:10] wouldn't be too bad but everybody likes
[38:12] to put it on Sunday
[38:13] well I'll do it on Sunday well I got I'm
[38:15] gonna have my kid party on Sunday it
[38:17] won't matter I might go in there second
[38:19] poll let us see in church page according
[38:23] to mount California he'll turn the
[38:24] hearts of the children to the fathers
[38:26] I want to reiterate this is why we're
[38:28] this is the stage that we're all in
[38:30] right now doesn't matter where you at in
[38:32] God we all had to start realizing we
[38:35] were lost and that the Son of God the
[38:37] New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:38] comes into our soul and then he starts
[38:42] working his way up that statue of
[38:45] perfect man and we're going to read this
[38:46] in a minute I didn't bring it out this
[38:48] morning because I was trying to fly to
[38:49] it and get to it but that tutor is the
[38:51] Holy Ghost and he's there to what train
[38:54] you
[38:56] by giving you Holy Ghost filled
[38:58] Preachers by giving you the prophet of
[38:59] God and giving you access to the message
[39:02] of the hour and listen to these brothers
[39:03] preach that's your tutor
[39:06] sure you've got the Holy Ghost that's
[39:08] inside of you but it's got to say
[39:10] brother Brown said it's got to say Amen
[39:12] to every word
[39:14] not just a few but every word that
[39:16] precedes a thousand mouth of God
[39:20] so that statue of a perfect man is to
[39:22] bring us to a place it's just like we
[39:25] were talking about this downstairs
[39:27] brother John
[39:29] um
[39:30] Porter's got a a son what's his name
[39:35] Jeffrey we met him at the
[39:38] at the wedding
[39:40] and uh he we go tall guy about that tall
[39:43] I wonder where you got that from
[39:45] and put your mom and dad together he'd
[39:46] be that tall
[39:49] but he's just a super nice guy but you
[39:51] could tell he had a shell he had
[39:52] something that was
[39:54] maybe like a little beef with something
[39:56] or of course he's a cop but
[39:58] they have their own attitude but still
[40:00] you could tell that there was something
[40:02] that was not flowing good that was
[40:05] something that you can tell when
[40:06] somebody's been hurt
[40:07] am I am I okay Lily that's kind of I
[40:10] didn't mean to call his name but but
[40:12] anyway pray for him that brother John
[40:13] said pray for him because what happened
[40:15] was after that after that
[40:18] um
[40:19] wedding
[40:21] he came to John and he said
[40:24] I thought all people were like so-and-so
[40:27] he had put every one of us in a bottle
[40:29] because he had been under a Ministry
[40:32] that was total legalism and this and
[40:35] that and the other
[40:36] and you'd know his name if I called him
[40:38] he's passed on now and that's okay he
[40:41] played his part but he he instilled in
[40:43] the people so much of a hardness till it
[40:46] was hard to break that shell
[40:49] but he said out of his own mouth that he
[40:53] had not met people like he met at that
[40:56] did you know he said that yeah your dad
[40:58] called me and told me the day afterwards
[41:00] and I'm gonna I'm gonna share it with
[41:01] you because I want you to pray for the
[41:02] brother because you know what that's God
[41:04] softening him up
[41:05] you and I all if you're not born again
[41:08] you've got a hard shell
[41:10] your hard shell
[41:12] but what did I tell you year you know
[41:15] well sermons are going Ezekiel brother
[41:17] Rob said he gives you a new heart
[41:21] and then he gives you a new spirit
[41:23] that's not the Holy Spirit that's the
[41:25] spirit to soften up your heart that's
[41:27] some where you can get along with
[41:28] yourself he does not get along with
[41:30] himself
[41:33] he does not get along with himself you
[41:35] could tell it there was something he was
[41:36] nice and cordial but there was some
[41:38] little something that I knew that maybe
[41:40] he was I thought maybe he had had an
[41:42] incident in his past life which he did
[41:45] but it was with meeting message
[41:47] Believers that were just really hard and
[41:49] they were always legalistic and always
[41:51] saying stuff bad about people and then
[41:54] he met all of us and I'm talking about
[41:55] all of us and everybody that was there
[41:57] that was Believers and he said I'd never
[41:59] seen that before in a group of people
[42:01] so see your life
[42:04] you go somewhere in life and you think
[42:06] man I'm nothing ain't nothing going on
[42:09] in my life there ain't nothing I mean I
[42:12] but I think I'll go to that I'll go that
[42:14] way
[42:15] so we'll go away and okay we'll go the
[42:17] wedding so you go to the wedding you
[42:18] have a good time just be yourself
[42:20] all right be the Holy Ghost you are and
[42:23] let that Holy Ghost what proceed out
[42:26] and then you go back home though and
[42:28] somebody calls you like brother John and
[42:30] says hey I want to thank you people well
[42:32] he told me but I don't know if you want
[42:34] to keep me secret or not but it's not
[42:36] now so here we go
[42:38] he never said don't tell nobody
[42:41] but he did say this morning he said keep
[42:43] praying for him because he's he he's on
[42:47] his way to heading toward getting softer
[42:49] because he had a real hard shell yeah
[42:52] well you know why because of your life
[42:56] and and I'm gonna say this will you like
[42:58] it or not
[43:00] you can't stay home and let your light
[43:02] shine
[43:05] you can't stay home and let your light
[43:07] shine
[43:08] you've got to get out and let people see
[43:11] your light
[43:13] so
[43:14] go to a wedding
[43:16] go to the funeral
[43:18] go to go to go to nobody's ever said
[43:21] anything wrong about going to birthday
[43:22] parties and and things like that you
[43:25] ought to go family reunions you ought to
[43:26] go
[43:27] why
[43:28] that right there may happen
[43:30] to wear one or two of you said one thing
[43:33] to this guy you've never seen a day in
[43:34] his life which I hadn't either
[43:36] and and speak to him and then all of a
[43:38] sudden something inside of him says Hey
[43:41] There is a real
[43:43] there's something besides what I've been
[43:46] dealing with during my young life
[43:49] and then brother John said really pray
[43:51] for him so we're going to pray for him
[43:52] and that that the Lord will softening up
[43:55] a little bit more now sometimes the Lord
[43:56] softens you up a different way than that
[43:59] he lets you go through a lot of stuff
[44:01] but somewhere in that in that Journey
[44:03] though
[44:04] somewhere you're going to meet somebody
[44:08] you're going to meet somebody and
[44:10] they're going to portray Christ and
[44:11] you're going to say wow
[44:13] so that's what I've been missing
[44:16] that everybody's not in this certain
[44:18] mold and we go through this certain
[44:20] tunnel and we're message people and and
[44:23] you know we're
[44:25] or all like this
[44:27] now we're different people but we all
[44:30] have the Holy Ghost that's born again
[44:31] and we can portray that and when the
[44:33] people really see the Holy Ghost
[44:36] it has to lead them to something
[44:39] if there's anything
[44:41] your brother has got to lead him to that
[44:43] but
[44:45] first
[44:47] and he did I hope he did well I'm
[44:49] praying he did listen when somebody when
[44:52] when I say well I hope
[44:54] but when somebody
[44:56] that's been that way comes and tells
[44:59] their dad
[45:00] your dad comes and tell and said hey I
[45:03] never met a people like that before
[45:06] they were really genuine people
[45:08] they didn't judge me for who I am they
[45:10] they judged me for my wife or for all
[45:12] these different things they took me as
[45:14] what I was
[45:15] well guess what then God took that
[45:18] little crack
[45:20] and he shined a light through it
[45:23] and when he shine a light through that
[45:24] crack
[45:25] it opened up his life
[45:27] and then we're praying now that God will
[45:29] give him a new heart give him a new
[45:30] spirit give him something soften him up
[45:32] some and you know what
[45:35] it'll produce life
[45:37] so I'm expecting to hear something from
[45:39] that story what are you saying brother
[45:40] wait well that's you the statue of
[45:42] perfect man you we walked I don't say it
[45:45] wasn't me it was a collective body of
[45:48] Believers that were there
[45:49] that each
[45:51] were helping each one of us were doing
[45:54] things I mean it was a wedding for them
[45:58] we weren't there for that wedding
[46:00] we were there for you brother
[46:04] y'all were going to get married anyway
[46:06] whether we were there or not
[46:08] but your brother was not going to get
[46:09] anything if we weren't there you ever
[46:11] thought about that
[46:12] sometimes we go to places say well we're
[46:15] just going to go you're going for a
[46:17] purpose the footsteps of the righteous
[46:19] are ordered of the Lord
[46:21] amen where you walk
[46:23] [Applause]
[46:27] but that's what we're under now we're
[46:28] under the we're under this we'll talk
[46:31] about the spirit of wisdom but I believe
[46:33] the spirit of wisdom brother Brown talks
[46:35] about coming back into the church the
[46:37] spirit of wisdom to do what to help us
[46:39] and lead us and guide us and to make us
[46:42] what a Powerhouse that Powerhouse I was
[46:43] talking about is that statue of a
[46:46] perfect man all of the virtues working
[46:48] in our life
[46:50] and you know what
[46:51] we weren't
[46:53] blackbirds that stuck peacock feathers
[46:55] because I'll promise you one thing if
[46:58] somebody's been hurt or if somebody's
[47:00] had a bad experience with message
[47:01] believers they know if you're sticking
[47:03] feathers in you and you're some kind of
[47:05] a of a uh fool or or some kind of
[47:08] somebody that's trying to hide something
[47:12] even though they don't have discernment
[47:14] of the Holy Ghost they got enough
[47:15] discernment in their life to know
[47:17] whether you're putting on or not
[47:19] and he knew we weren't putting on and
[47:21] that was what impressed him more than
[47:24] anything else so sorry we weren't there
[47:26] for your wedding we were there they were
[47:28] there for you brother listen I'm gonna
[47:30] tell you something y'all say what you
[47:32] want to about me I won't ever soul I
[47:34] know saved
[47:35] I won't ever show and I'm sorry if I'm
[47:37] so passionate that I step on your toes
[47:39] or step on somebody else's toes I want
[47:41] them say I told the Lord last night I
[47:42] said I want to not just fill with the
[47:45] Holy Ghost I want to put in action
[47:48] I want to not have to yeah clap
[47:53] we got enough problems it is but more
[47:56] filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:00] and and how that we can handle each
[48:03] other handle brotherly kindness how
[48:05] patience be patient with each other
[48:08] right we hadn't even got there yet
[48:10] but we got to have knowledge
[48:13] to know what's right and what's wrong
[48:15] now listen there's a knowledge out in
[48:17] the world to know right and wrong amen
[48:19] right I mean but now remember that's
[48:22] getting real foggy now
[48:25] the line between right and wrong in the
[48:28] world is getting real foggy because what
[48:31] the world calls right we consider wrong
[48:36] amen and then then they're right and
[48:39] wrong is not very far apart
[48:41] because they can do pretty much what
[48:43] they want to do and still say they're
[48:44] Christian in that world all right but we
[48:48] know better
[48:51] why do we know better because we don't
[48:53] just have a knowledge of the truth we
[48:55] are the truth
[48:57] have you ever thought about that we're
[48:58] the truth of this world there's no one
[49:00] else has truth but this word this bride
[49:02] of Jesus Christ we're the only people
[49:04] with truth
[49:07] so that's what we're living under now
[49:09] we're living under this manifestation of
[49:11] the Holy Ghost or the Tudor being in the
[49:15] church teaching us
[49:17] just how to be good Christians
[49:19] how to be a light to shine if you go to
[49:22] Walmart and and the other days and I
[49:25] usually if if somebody you know if we
[49:28] open the door for somebody I'll say well
[49:31] you know have a good day but there was
[49:33] this one lady open the door she was a
[49:35] younger lady I opened the door for her
[49:37] and I said God bless you this it just
[49:38] came out you know but sometimes you
[49:40] don't have to go to the chiropractor
[49:41] after that come on
[49:47] how many people ever said God bless them
[49:50] people don't do that
[49:52] they do the other stuff
[49:54] but we do that
[49:56] but see they're not expecting the world
[49:57] to do that
[49:58] they're expecting the world most of the
[50:00] time not even open the door for you
[50:02] but we open the door and say God bless
[50:04] you and mean it me to have a good day
[50:07] told of um a waitress the other day said
[50:10] God bless you you just have a good day
[50:11] we appreciate what you've done I mean we
[50:14] sat there for two or three hours in our
[50:16] booth so we gave her a good tip and and
[50:19] uh and told her thanks for your patience
[50:22] you know so so we we try to do that you
[50:24] say well that don't mean nothing to them
[50:26] you don't know that
[50:28] how many of you knew that her brother
[50:30] needed some help
[50:31] not one of you we all walked to their
[50:34] oblivious it was all lilium Zach Lily
[50:36] and Zach Lily and Zack one more time
[50:38] Lilly and Zach everything with Lily and
[50:41] Zach Lily come over here Zach come over
[50:43] here
[50:43] when there was a soul standing there
[50:45] that was watching everything we did
[50:48] and was impressed with the attitude that
[50:50] we took
[50:51] toward all that and how we helped and
[50:55] washed all 300 of those goblets of
[50:58] Janet's
[51:00] thank you
[51:02] all right I need some more Temperance
[51:04] and patience I'm sorry but
[51:07] Jim started washing them things and I
[51:09] thought how in the world could one
[51:11] person accumulate that many and I
[51:13] thought get it good
[51:17] and she did you took them all home put
[51:19] them up they had a place in your house
[51:21] somewhere didn't they
[51:23] in the living room okay all right that's
[51:24] a good place to put goblets
[51:28] but what am I trying to say
[51:30] you may think you're just absolutely
[51:32] nothing and nothing's going on in your
[51:34] life and then you have somebody to come
[51:35] up to you just out of the blue
[51:38] like brother John call me the next day
[51:40] said man y'all made an impression on my
[51:41] son
[51:42] I said what do you mean y'all he said oh
[51:44] y'all helping and what Janet did well
[51:46] she did a great job and then Julie
[51:47] helped June all Anna I mean um different
[51:51] ones helped that were there and
[51:54] it was just a unit working together
[51:56] wasn't it by fussing or complaining
[51:58] stuff about the goblins
[52:01] and they were all different how do you
[52:03] do that
[52:04] you know if it had been 300 of the same
[52:06] thing but it was 300 different cups
[52:09] anyway
[52:10] and Richard would enjoy taking communion
[52:12] out of them because they were big ones
[52:15] but but somebody was watching us
[52:20] think about that
[52:21] and I'm gonna say one more time Rachel
[52:23] did you know that did you know there was
[52:25] somebody watching
[52:27] somebody watching you
[52:30] different ones who were there working
[52:31] different ones who were doing things in
[52:33] the in the uh in the wedding because we
[52:36] were there for Lily and Zach
[52:40] but we weren't
[52:42] what a story
[52:43] to me that just make a whole sermon
[52:45] right there it's just we walked among
[52:47] them
[52:49] and they noticed that we were different
[52:52] and there was no flag now I'm watching
[52:55] y'all I'm watching I'm watching you no
[52:58] he was watching never said a word
[53:02] he was watching now tell them how many
[53:04] others we didn't get you know we didn't
[53:06] get a a
[53:08] um something from anybody else it was
[53:10] just happened to me Lily's brother
[53:14] but you don't know
[53:17] and I'll promise you one thing young
[53:19] kids young adults and old people people
[53:22] watching us
[53:23] people watching every move you make and
[53:26] we do make mistakes and we do sometimes
[53:28] do things that are they're a little bit
[53:30] different but remember God's watch
[53:34] and then the people are looking at you
[53:36] wanting to see God inside of you
[53:39] amen
[53:40] so you just remember that
[53:42] but now that what's going to be with the
[53:43] third pool you got to come up a little
[53:45] bit higher to where it's a revelation of
[53:47] the mystery that's never been told to
[53:49] man ever before
[53:51] because the statue of perfect man has
[53:54] been told the statue perfect man is
[53:56] plainly in second Peter Peter says add
[53:59] to your faith virtue and all the tempers
[54:00] patience that you'll get this divine
[54:02] nature of God and all these things need
[54:04] to be working in a Christian Life yeah
[54:06] but now when you come to this third
[54:08] point or the opening the mystery truce
[54:10] of the seven Thunders which is the Seven
[54:13] Seals then that comes up to the son of
[54:15] man which we're going to get to a little
[54:16] bit later are the chief headstone which
[54:19] he started as a Cornerstone but he will
[54:22] be now the one that will cap this whole
[54:24] thing off
[54:25] that will set down on top of you and be
[54:28] God
[54:30] on Earth in his fullness in the bride
[54:33] not in one person in the bride
[54:35] now he chose that we didn't
[54:38] he chose to bring it that way
[54:41] what's he gonna do bring back the church
[54:43] to the word because you see brother
[54:45] around him he's standing there and he's
[54:47] got he's got every denomination standing
[54:50] in front of him
[54:51] and he's trying to preach to bring the
[54:53] church back to the word of God one word
[54:55] One Faith one Lord one baptism
[55:00] and you got a baptism sitting over here
[55:02] you got Seventh-day Adventist over here
[55:04] you got Jehovah's Witness over here
[55:06] because he calls them all out right and
[55:09] you got all those things but to bring
[55:11] back the message
[55:13] or the word of God and then that becomes
[55:16] power because what power without
[55:18] character
[55:19] it's satanic what happened was they had
[55:22] the power in the first church age
[55:24] second and third but when you got to the
[55:26] fourth fifth sixth Church Aid and then
[55:29] even this church age is supposed to be
[55:31] everything the Resurrection coming back
[55:33] bringing back the word of God the
[55:35] prophet of God said it was dark the
[55:36] Bible said it was the darkest time ever
[55:38] to man
[55:39] it's this time right here
[55:41] why because the world's engross gross
[55:44] Darkness
[55:45] bad Darkness
[55:47] but this messenger what is he to do
[55:50] restore back the original Faith the
[55:52] resurrection faith and that's what we
[55:54] want we want that part of Resurrection
[55:57] Faith all right he'll take the message
[56:01] of Pentecost to turn the children to the
[56:02] faith of the fathers
[56:04] listen there's a difference in a child
[56:06] and a father
[56:07] now one day that child
[56:10] that Mom and Dad had became a father
[56:14] because of what period of time because
[56:16] of learning because of maturity that's
[56:19] the same way with me and you we it
[56:20] doesn't matter if we become babies we
[56:22] just know don't need to stay babies we
[56:25] need to mature and become fathers
[56:27] because he'll rebu look he'll rebuke
[56:29] them because they didn't keep this same
[56:32] faith that was back at the beginning
[56:34] that's why the prophet of God said that
[56:36] that messenger would look would tie up
[56:39] Loose Ends
[56:40] are loose doctrines
[56:42] that was preached between the fourth age
[56:45] fifth eighth sixth age man had diluted
[56:47] this word of God to where it was what I
[56:50] can speak in tongues to get the Holy
[56:51] Ghost and that's it I can be uh on
[56:54] church on Saturday and that's it even a
[56:56] Seventh-Day Adventist will still tell
[56:57] you that the mark of the beast is having
[56:58] church on Sunday
[57:03] I'll take it
[57:05] I'm gonna take Sunday
[57:07] okay you can take Saturday all you want
[57:08] to Sunday is the day we worship the
[57:10] resurrection
[57:13] but it took Elijah to do what to tell us
[57:15] though that that's wrong
[57:17] so leave that alone
[57:19] Seventh-day Adventist is not going to
[57:21] take a resurrection
[57:23] there'll be some that will be in a
[57:24] resurrection but they'll not cause a
[57:26] resurrection the Pentecostals will not
[57:28] cause a resurrection the Baptist will
[57:30] not cause and they will be in the
[57:31] resurrection but it will take a group of
[57:33] people that our hearts our soul has been
[57:36] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[57:38] what knowing that this message is it
[57:41] this message is right this message just
[57:43] doesn't have any
[57:45] any
[57:47] any
[57:48] discrepancies in it
[57:52] it's God's word to me and you through
[57:55] the mouth of a prophet
[57:57] because he turned it back to the faith
[57:58] of the fathers
[58:00] because remember John the Baptist turned
[58:02] from the old
[58:04] Testament to the new message read it
[58:08] right there with a new message that
[58:09] Jesus came up with came out with is what
[58:12] the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand you must
[58:14] be born again they didn't hear that in
[58:16] the Old Testament but he took John now
[58:18] the next Spirit of Elijah came to
[58:20] brother onto brother Branham and turned
[58:22] those hearts to the babies back to the
[58:24] Pentecostal fathers what so so God can
[58:27] work
[58:28] and so this can be fulfilled and here's
[58:31] the here's the one I was reading this
[58:32] morning but I want to read it like this
[58:33] and I will restore to you
[58:35] not to the world
[58:37] he'll restore to you
[58:39] the years that the locusts eat canker
[58:42] worm listen it's eat this message down
[58:46] and a lot of people let's eat the
[58:48] effects of this message it's not going
[58:49] to eat the message it's going to eat the
[58:51] effects of this message
[58:52] to the people it's so eroded it and
[58:55] convoluted it and made it all milky and
[58:57] well maybe brother round was wrong here
[58:59] and maybe there wasn't 12 people fell
[59:01] off of this and maybe that was a maybe
[59:03] that was a rocket you maybe so what were
[59:06] they doing they were pulling it apart
[59:07] again
[59:09] but I want to tell you I'm part of that
[59:11] I will restore because he's restoring it
[59:13] back to me the faith of the fathers
[59:17] and you shall eat him plenty and be
[59:19] satisfied how are you going to eat in a
[59:21] tree that ain't nothing but a stump
[59:23] can you no

[59:27] that's got apples or whatever on the end
[59:29] of the on the end of the Vine

[59:34] that he hath dealt wondrously with you
[59:35] and my people shall never be ashamed
[59:39] folks I won't you ever be ashamed of
[59:40] this gospel don't you ever be ashamed of
[59:43] this message
[59:45] there's something inside of you that
[59:47] should keep you from being ashamed of
[59:48] this message amen
[59:54] so let's go to this adoption real quick
[59:56] go by
[59:57] go buy it real fast because remember
[59:58] everybody understands we've been taught
[1:00:00] president's taught us for years and
[1:00:01] years and years on adoption a lot of
[1:00:04] people don't teach on adoption you know
[1:00:05] why because they don't understand it but
[1:00:07] it's really really simple you start out
[1:00:09] as a newborn baby in Christ you're part
[1:00:12] of the family of God but you're not
[1:00:14] going to get the car keys or you're not
[1:00:15] going to get the checkbook to the to the
[1:00:18] you know 10 million dollar uh business
[1:00:20] that your daddy owns all right you're
[1:00:22] gonna do like Dave said you're gonna
[1:00:23] clean toilets First You're Gonna Learn
[1:00:25] how where the bathrooms are at not where
[1:00:27] they're at how to clean them
[1:00:29] well then that's what God is God's the
[1:00:31] same way we're babies he cries we give
[1:00:33] them he gives us stuff but then we come
[1:00:35] up to a place where he says Hey grow up
[1:00:38] quit crying as soon as the boy was born
[1:00:41] he was the son of that family
[1:00:43] the father loved him
[1:00:46] listen
[1:00:47] if he give you the new birth he loved
[1:00:49] you
[1:00:51] he loved you
[1:00:53] but do you love him back
[1:00:55] the way that he loves you
[1:00:59] cause to love him back is to do this
[1:01:02] right to love him back to show your love
[1:01:04] well I just love the Lord well if you
[1:01:07] love him he said what do you do
[1:01:12] you'll keep my Commandments what is my
[1:01:15] commandment right there
[1:01:17] that's your commandment is to live
[1:01:20] Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] the father loved him
[1:01:24] then you get over in Galatians talk
[1:01:25] about tutors so then the father had so
[1:01:27] much work to do over the whole Kingdom
[1:01:28] he placed a tutor now that's the Holy
[1:01:31] Ghost to me and you the tutor is the
[1:01:33] teacher is the Holy Ghost now but you've
[1:01:35] got to be you can't you say well then I
[1:01:37] can make it on my own no you can't that
[1:01:39] tutor has to teach you through a
[1:01:41] five-fold Ministry according to the
[1:01:43] Bible all right so according to the
[1:01:45] Bible you've got to have a teacher
[1:01:46] anyone who knows that was the Old
[1:01:48] Testament rule a tutor Paul speaks about
[1:01:51] the law being just a tutor to bring us
[1:01:52] to Christ or an educator
[1:01:55] so it brought us to Christ and then what
[1:01:57] to do the Holy Ghost Inside of us
[1:01:59] teaches us and God leads us and guides
[1:02:01] us into all truth but yet the father
[1:02:04] didn't know what to do with him or he
[1:02:06] would be or what he would be when he
[1:02:08] growed up now listen Our Father does
[1:02:10] know what we're going to be we just
[1:02:12] don't know it that's why we got to
[1:02:14] strive to be better we got to strive to
[1:02:15] do the things of God
[1:02:17] but yet the father didn't know what to
[1:02:19] do with him or what he would be when he
[1:02:21] growed up
[1:02:23] then he keeps going on talk about if I'm
[1:02:25] wrong correct me what happened when to
[1:02:28] the Full Gospel Church you know what's
[1:02:29] he telling them he's telling look you
[1:02:31] guys had the Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] you had the Holy Ghost you still got the
[1:02:35] Holy Ghost
[1:02:36] you became Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:02:39] you didn't move on up with God you
[1:02:42] stayed right there you did look in other
[1:02:44] words you became malnourished you
[1:02:46] decided that milk's All I'm gonna drink
[1:02:51] they come sons and the Holy Ghost is a
[1:02:54] tutor to raise them in the admonition of
[1:02:56] God now as the tutor had been watching
[1:02:58] the children the church has been
[1:03:00] progressing coming up they've seen the
[1:03:01] age of birth born again that's right
[1:03:03] correct you're just as much a son as you
[1:03:05] ever will be when you're born again but
[1:03:07] the tutor bringing the word to the
[1:03:09] father
[1:03:10] then if the Father the tutor came to the
[1:03:13] father and the boy become about age of
[1:03:15] where the church ought to be now comes
[1:03:17] of age brightens up that brightened up
[1:03:19] season according to Time when the boy
[1:03:22] became a base the tutor came to the
[1:03:23] father what the what he's saying he said
[1:03:25] hey this is where this guy's worthy this
[1:03:27] son see the boy being a son already but
[1:03:30] yet if he wasn't a worthy son the father
[1:03:32] couldn't adopt him
[1:03:34] or place him in his own family he
[1:03:37] couldn't do it because the boy would run
[1:03:39] through what he had he was Restless he
[1:03:42] didn't have the ability to carry on the
[1:03:43] father's work so the father just let him
[1:03:45] go on being a son he already was a son
[1:03:48] but if he was a fine son he was about
[1:03:51] his father's business and the Tudor
[1:03:52] brought word to the father saying that
[1:03:54] the son is fine he's eligible he's all
[1:03:57] right then the father took the son out
[1:03:59] in the public place as a public
[1:04:00] testimony and he put a special robe on
[1:04:02] him and set him up before the people
[1:04:04] what was he doing he was giving him
[1:04:06] Authority
[1:04:07] he gave him Authority with God he wants
[1:04:10] to give you Authority
[1:04:12] well I don't know maybe I'll mess up
[1:04:14] you get these virtues and you won't mess
[1:04:16] up I said what he wants
[1:04:22] y'all don't leave the building on me
[1:04:24] okay
[1:04:25] and the father by doing this give the
[1:04:27] son the authority over his kingdom over
[1:04:30] his business and so forth the son had a
[1:04:33] right to go out and do certain things in
[1:04:34] the Kingdom with the same kind of
[1:04:36] authority that his father had wow
[1:04:43] now let's talk a minute we know what
[1:04:45] virtue is it's strength and power that's
[1:04:47] the first thing we've got to have is
[1:04:49] virtue we've got to have strength and
[1:04:51] power because listen when we get on down
[1:04:54] a little bit further what does the world
[1:04:55] say about knowledge
[1:04:57] the the world says knowledge is power
[1:05:01] reading I used to read a lot
[1:05:05] knowledge is power
[1:05:07] but you know what
[1:05:08] that knowledge created an atomic bomb
[1:05:11] one time that kills 200 and some
[1:05:12] thousand people
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:17] and we use it for electricity now and if
[1:05:19] it ever blows up we're in big trouble
[1:05:21] again Chernobyl Three Mile Island all
[1:05:24] the different things we think we've got
[1:05:25] everything figured out and then we
[1:05:27] missed something because we're human
[1:05:29] all right now listen God don't miss
[1:05:31] something
[1:05:32] you've got to realize today that he
[1:05:35] equips you and Powers you for what you
[1:05:37] need
[1:05:39] and you got to believe that
[1:05:41] even though you have kinks in your armor
[1:05:43] even though you do have things in your
[1:05:45] life that you got to overcome
[1:05:48] if you just keep striving you'll
[1:05:51] overcome them you'll have to
[1:05:53] It's just sometimes we quit we stop we
[1:05:56] get to a point and we go can't do it
[1:05:58] anymore well if you're a son and
[1:06:00] daughter of God you will do it if you're
[1:06:03] not you never was
[1:06:07] a virtuous woman is a crowned or a
[1:06:09] husband
[1:06:10] the crowning effect of Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] coming out of the grave
[1:06:15] is me and you
[1:06:18] bringing others out of the grave
[1:06:20] think about that
[1:06:22] when Jesus came out of the Grave he said
[1:06:24] all power and Heaven and Earth been
[1:06:25] given unto me now what did he tell him
[1:06:27] he said you go wait to be endued with
[1:06:30] what the power I have
[1:06:32] right you go away
[1:06:35] in Jerusalem
[1:06:36] to be endued with power that I have
[1:06:39] from on high because I'm coming back I'm
[1:06:41] not coming back in flesh I'm coming back
[1:06:43] in a spirit form and I'm going to enter
[1:06:45] you and you are going to be my bride
[1:06:47] you're going to be somebody that I'm
[1:06:49] going to work through the only way Jesus
[1:06:51] Christ got known around the world was by
[1:06:53] holy ghost-filled people because I'll
[1:06:55] promise you the devil's kids didn't want
[1:06:58] to have nothing to do with it
[1:06:59] all right
[1:07:01] but a virtuous woman is a crown or
[1:07:03] husband but she doesn't maketh ashamed
[1:07:05] as rottenness in his bone that's why
[1:07:08] that you look at the nicolaitan spirit
[1:07:11] that
[1:07:13] Jesus told him and said you've lost your
[1:07:15] first love he said but there's one thing
[1:07:17] I got with you I'm with you on this I
[1:07:19] hate the Nicholas in spirit I hate you
[1:07:21] Conquering the laity all right now to
[1:07:23] conquer the laity what do you got to
[1:07:25] have you got to have preachers that are
[1:07:27] cut that conquer first
[1:07:29] Satan has conquered preachers to preach
[1:07:31] the wrong message of the hour to preach
[1:07:33] false Doctrine and then guess what he's
[1:07:36] got you when he's got the ministry
[1:07:38] yeah man
[1:07:40] that's why we believe
[1:07:42] that the truth is the truth and then
[1:07:45] when we live in the truth and abide by
[1:07:46] the truth God's got to come on the scene
[1:07:48] and help us
[1:07:51] all right so let's look at knowledge
[1:07:52] real quick
[1:07:53] let's take a Peter 1 verse 5 and being
[1:07:55] besides this giving all diligence add to
[1:07:58] your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge
[1:08:01] knowledge in the Greek means no sis or
[1:08:04] science or knowledge signifies in
[1:08:06] general intelligence understanding
[1:08:08] general knowledge of Christian religion
[1:08:10] the deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:08:13] knowledge of this religion
[1:08:14] such as belonging to the more advanced
[1:08:17] why would it say that
[1:08:19] why would it say that
[1:08:21] because you can have knowledge that one
[1:08:22] plus one is two but that's not going to
[1:08:24] help you
[1:08:25] later on in life
[1:08:28] such belongs to the more advanced
[1:08:30] especially of things lawful and unlawful
[1:08:33] for Christians moral wisdom such as is
[1:08:36] seen in right living you see what that's
[1:08:38] been here that's been eroded moral
[1:08:40] living is now it doesn't matter you can
[1:08:42] be divorced three or four times you can
[1:08:44] be this you can be that you can do a
[1:08:46] little bit of this and a little bit of
[1:08:47] that well you ain't perfect neither am I
[1:08:49] you hear that all the time
[1:08:52] Jesus said be therefore perfect so I'm
[1:08:54] going to kind of let him handle that all
[1:08:56] right
[1:08:58] so we look at the two trees the tree of
[1:09:00] knowledge of Good and Evil and
[1:09:02] the Tree of Life
[1:09:04] Whom Shall teach he teach knowledge in
[1:09:06] Whom Shall he make to understand
[1:09:07] Doctrine then there are weaned from the
[1:09:09] milk and drawn from the breast
[1:09:12] it's not bad to be babies it's bad to
[1:09:14] stay babies now watch this knowledge
[1:09:15] real quick we'll close right here
[1:09:17] the fact or condition of knowing
[1:09:20] something look with familiarity
[1:09:25] that's the key
[1:09:26] you can know today how to build an
[1:09:28] atomic bomb that ain't got one thing to
[1:09:30] do with your Christian Life
[1:09:34] well I know how to
[1:09:36] that's okay
[1:09:37] do you know how to rightly divide the
[1:09:39] word of Truth
[1:09:40] are you familiar with what's being
[1:09:43] preached
[1:09:44] are you familiar with the voice
[1:09:48] of the seventh angel
[1:09:50] are you familiar with the voice of God
[1:09:54] to know that it's the voice of God not
[1:09:56] the voice of the other guy
[1:09:58] the fact or condition of knowing
[1:10:01] something with familiarity gained
[1:10:03] through experience our association I
[1:10:08] want to be guilty of being Jesus Christ
[1:10:11] by association
[1:10:14] let us be found worthy
[1:10:16] let us not be found in the alley
[1:10:19] let us be found worthy
[1:10:24] the fact or condition of being aware of
[1:10:26] something
[1:10:28] are you aware that this is the truth
[1:10:31] huh
[1:10:34] are you aware of that that this is the
[1:10:37] truth not a truth it's not part of it I
[1:10:39] don't like I don't want I don't disclude
[1:10:42] nobody but God told us what to do he
[1:10:45] told us what was right and what was
[1:10:46] wrong listen he he
[1:10:49] Ard him and he was going to do
[1:10:51] but he had to give him a choice he had
[1:10:53] to let them go on free moral agency but
[1:10:55] he knew what they were going to do as
[1:10:57] soon as he made the devil he knew what
[1:10:59] the devil was going to do but he did it
[1:11:01] anyway
[1:11:03] he did it to prove that he was God
[1:11:06] and that all this is going to evolve
[1:11:08] into living in me and you every bit of
[1:11:10] this all from beginning of time
[1:11:12] to right now
[1:11:16] let's look at this right here
[1:11:19] the circumstance or condition of
[1:11:22] apprehending Truth
[1:11:25] are facts the reasoning you say oh
[1:11:28] reasoning the Bible says come let us
[1:11:30] reason together
[1:11:32] that's your sins be not what
[1:11:34] Scarlet but there'd be white as snow
[1:11:37] listen what brother Brown said right
[1:11:39] here and then we'll close
[1:11:40] some of y'all have already checked out
[1:11:43] and then thirdly you add knowledge
[1:11:45] knowledge now that don't mean worldly
[1:11:47] knowledge because that's foolishness to
[1:11:49] God
[1:11:50] but knowledge to judge judge what right
[1:11:53] from wrong
[1:11:55] you know the Bible tells us and we'll
[1:11:56] get into it later on where the Bible
[1:11:58] tells us that we'll judge angels
[1:12:01] that when you read in Revelations that
[1:12:03] when you see those Thrones you're
[1:12:05] setting on them
[1:12:07] you the person of you are sitting on
[1:12:10] those Thrones judging the world
[1:12:14] that's why the Bible says look Brothers
[1:12:17] should never take a brother to court
[1:12:20] that's almost Blasphemous to do that
[1:12:24] who greedy people is what it is
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:30] I'm just telling you what the Bible said
[1:12:31] folks the Bible said do not take a
[1:12:33] brother to court
[1:12:34] in other words what you do bring it
[1:12:36] right here let's work it out how many of
[1:12:37] you brought your problems in there
[1:12:38] worked it out with brother Dale I didn't
[1:12:41] think so because that's foolishness to
[1:12:43] God but knowledge to judge just what
[1:12:46] right from wrong how do you judge it
[1:12:48] then if you've got Christian knowledge
[1:12:50] with you virtue and Faith you judge
[1:12:53] whether the word is right or wrong
[1:12:56] if you can lay aside all your Creeds all
[1:13:00] your unbelief everything that you claim
[1:13:03] you've done
[1:13:04] take claim you've done then you have
[1:13:07] knowledge to believe that God cannot lie
[1:13:10] see now you're getting knowledge that's
[1:13:13] Supreme knowledge you don't have to have
[1:13:15] four degrees in some college or
[1:13:17] something like that to have it because
[1:13:18] all these virtues are given to you by
[1:13:21] God to place upon the foundation of your
[1:13:24] faith that you might come to the full
[1:13:26] stature of a real living man of God
[1:13:33] now when you get to that add that to
[1:13:35] your faith when you get true virtue then
[1:13:37] add it to your faith when you can walk
[1:13:39] excuse me walk out here on the street
[1:13:41] live like a Christian act like a
[1:13:43] Christian that was my whole point that
[1:13:44] we had just a few minutes ago all right
[1:13:46] be a Christian add that to your faith
[1:13:48] when you have knowledge you say well I
[1:13:51] don't know whether the scripture is
[1:13:52] right or not now here's Acts 2 38. I
[1:13:56] don't know how to go about it with acts
[1:13:57] 28 19. hide on all right all right don't
[1:14:00] add nothing because you ain't got it yet
[1:14:04] what you gonna do because you haven't
[1:14:06] got knowledge enough to know of God yet
[1:14:09] that the Bible doesn't contradict itself
[1:14:11] leave it alone don't say no more about
[1:14:14] it see leave it alone
[1:14:16] and I wanted to interject right there
[1:14:18] where brother Brown told him on the
[1:14:20] Sixth Seal he said it's gone from you
[1:14:22] it's not for you
[1:14:24] right
[1:14:25] see leave it alone in other words what's
[1:14:27] happened to man between then and now
[1:14:29] they've made the seven uh Thunders seven
[1:14:32] people
[1:14:33] they made it seven virtues they've made
[1:14:36] the seals polygamy they've made this
[1:14:39] that and this why they didn't leave it
[1:14:41] alone
[1:14:42] they didn't let the spirit of wisdom
[1:14:45] which we'll talk about
[1:14:46] next week I'm gonna stop right here
[1:14:51] leave it alone
[1:14:52] don't try to push
[1:14:58] cause remember he's got a time and if
[1:15:00] this is the time if you like brother
[1:15:02] Brown said he said you see these scrap
[1:15:04] heaps of ministers that have went out
[1:15:06] Beyond God's program
[1:15:10] all right they were true ministers if
[1:15:12] they'd awaited
[1:15:15] year after year waited
[1:15:17] listen to the word of God listen to the
[1:15:20] tapes the books listen to good ministers
[1:15:23] but
[1:15:25] what do we want to do
[1:15:27] we want to be the popular guy
[1:15:29] we want to be I've seen this more often
[1:15:31] than anything is you know brother Brown
[1:15:35] said money women in popularity is three
[1:15:36] things that that'll destroy a minister
[1:15:39] popularity is to me I can see that more
[1:15:43] than all the other two it's popularity
[1:15:45] everybody wants to be top of the Heap
[1:15:48] and if they if they didn't get that
[1:15:50] Revelation you sure didn't get it
[1:15:52] because I supposed to get it I'm
[1:15:54] supposed to get it first
[1:15:56] don't tell me you got it
[1:15:59] I got it I'm supposed to get it first
[1:16:02] we've heard that before
[1:16:06] but when you can see but when you can
[1:16:09] see that the scripture is not
[1:16:10] contradictory
[1:16:12] that you can say that can see that by
[1:16:15] the revelation of God the whole word is
[1:16:17] rodent Mysteries and only the knowledge
[1:16:20] of God can reveal it
[1:16:22] only the knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:16:26] then when you get and say punctuate
[1:16:28] every word of God with an amen then add
[1:16:31] that to your faith let's stand
[1:16:35] brother Brown prays and he says in the
[1:16:37] Statue of perfect man at the very end he
[1:16:39] said look he's praying he says Build Me
[1:16:41] Up O Lord into this
[1:16:43] let Christ be my head that works through
[1:16:45] me that working through me on my
[1:16:47] Foundation my faith is in him let virtue
[1:16:49] in all his Temperance patience Godless
[1:16:51] brotherly kindness work in Me O Lord is
[1:16:53] my prayer I don't care live or die sink
[1:16:55] or drown denomination no denomination
[1:16:57] friend or no friend let that work in me
[1:17:00] let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out
[1:17:04] then I might be able
[1:17:06] to teach those
[1:17:08] there's nobody in this generation spoke
[1:17:11] the truth
[1:17:12] of knowledge like brother Brown did
[1:17:15] and he had a seventh grade education he
[1:17:18] taught like we did
[1:17:19] aunts and totes and Carries and taters
[1:17:22] and maters
[1:17:24] but he spoke the word of God
[1:17:26] because he had knowledge of the truth
[1:17:29] look but flow out that I might be able
[1:17:32] to teach those
[1:17:34] for God has said in the church Apostles
[1:17:36] prophets teachers pastors and
[1:17:37] evangelists all for the perfecting and
[1:17:40] bringing all these virtues into it for
[1:17:43] that Perfection of the coming of the Son
[1:17:45] of God each one of these stones are a
[1:17:48] material off of that one this is
[1:17:50] material of this each one of these
[1:17:53] virtues belonging to him and they're
[1:17:55] pouring out of him down through them
[1:17:59] down through them
[1:18:01] not just me brother Dale the ministers
[1:18:04] know laity
[1:18:06] because it's not going to work unless it
[1:18:07] works in the bride and we'll talk about
[1:18:10] it Sunday we'll talk about the spirit of
[1:18:11] wisdom because look brother Brown tells
[1:18:13] us the spirit of wisdom comes into the
[1:18:15] church to make known to the church by
[1:18:16] the revelation of the Holy Ghost brings
[1:18:18] the church in and reveals what day
[1:18:19] you're living in just the same as
[1:18:21] Gabriel to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes
[1:18:23] to the church in the last days to reveal
[1:18:25] these great deep secret things do you
[1:18:28] understand now
[1:18:30] musicians come
[1:18:31] do you understand now
[1:18:36] because what where's the spirit of
[1:18:38] wisdom coming from Spirit of wisdom
[1:18:39] comes from the spirit of the Lord
[1:18:41] Spirit of wisdom and understanding the
[1:18:43] spirit of counsel and might the spirit
[1:18:45] of knowledge and the fear of the Lord
[1:18:47] that's why that the Bible tells us not
[1:18:50] to take a brother to court
[1:18:51] there ought to be enough knowledge in
[1:18:53] this building to handle every situation
[1:18:56] that needs to be handled
[1:18:58] and not have to take somebody to court
[1:19:00] now listen there's a difference in that
[1:19:03] brother Dale told us this long long time
[1:19:04] ago there's a difference in somebody
[1:19:06] doing you wrong that's out there in the
[1:19:07] world because he's going to go get a
[1:19:09] lawyer he don't know no different so you
[1:19:12] need to get one but now somebody that's
[1:19:13] a Believer inside this building and and
[1:19:16] and you know you you think you've been
[1:19:17] slighted or we need to work that out
[1:19:19] here
[1:19:21] the problem is we tell everybody else
[1:19:24] but the people here
[1:19:28] they get quiet when you start talking
[1:19:30] like that
[1:19:32] I don't know what sometimes they don't
[1:19:33] hear me around
[1:19:36] but we do
[1:19:39] if we'll just be honest and look at each
[1:19:41] other and say hey I got a problem with
[1:19:43] you
[1:19:45] right
[1:19:52] and we take it in Holy Ghost love
[1:19:55] because see the spirit of wisdom is not
[1:19:57] going to move you
[1:19:59] unless you want to be moved
[1:20:01] you can stay a baby you can deny you can
[1:20:04] say and and I know I know for a fact
[1:20:08] I've heard people say that's just too
[1:20:11] deep for me now how in the world can God
[1:20:14] write a Bible how can my father and my
[1:20:17] mother do something to me that I don't
[1:20:19] understand
[1:20:22] that'd be really something against them
[1:20:24] too if they did something that they
[1:20:26] could they did something that made it
[1:20:28] where I couldn't understand nothing
[1:20:29] that's like telling your kid as the
[1:20:31] Bible says
[1:20:33] I want a fish Daddy
[1:20:35] and they give you a scorpion
[1:20:37] I need some bread Daddy
[1:20:38] and they give you a rock that's not what
[1:20:41] your father and mother is going to do
[1:20:43] your father-in-law is going to give you
[1:20:44] the best they're not going now they have
[1:20:46] to keep things from me because obviously
[1:20:48] from him for human purposes but just to
[1:20:51] just to make sure that they don't give
[1:20:52] you anything to to to to to further
[1:20:56] yourself in life that's wrong and God's
[1:20:58] not going to do that either not because
[1:21:00] I'm gonna write in this Bible and then
[1:21:01] say when I wait a minute that's not for
[1:21:03] you
[1:21:05] no it's for us
[1:21:07] you just got to make yourself available
[1:21:08] for it
[1:21:10] because I've heard some of you say
[1:21:12] that's just too deep for me I don't
[1:21:14] understand that you know what that's
[1:21:15] okay
[1:21:16] but a baby will say that
[1:21:18] but uh matura coming up from a teenager
[1:21:21] to a mature adult you're learning
[1:21:24] so you can't just it's not going to be
[1:21:26] all poured into you at one time brother
[1:21:28] Luis your ego will tell you for a fact
[1:21:30] he came here
[1:21:32] he had um been working up in and um he
[1:21:37] got him a job down here and uh with Joe
[1:21:39] and and brother Richard and he was going
[1:21:43] to a church and and the brother's fine I
[1:21:45] mean everything's good it's just that
[1:21:47] Luis was was he had heard you know about
[1:21:49] brother Dale he had heard about you know
[1:21:51] the the depth of the message and it
[1:21:54] scared him to death
[1:21:57] and we've had people do that they'll
[1:21:58] walk in here and three months later or
[1:22:00] two weeks later they're gone stick
[1:22:02] around if you got the Holy Ghost it's
[1:22:05] got to lead you in all truth
[1:22:08] Louise said I didn't understand nothing
[1:22:10] about what brother Dale was talking
[1:22:12] about
[1:22:13] he said but I stayed and I stayed and I
[1:22:17] stayed
[1:22:18] he said I didn't get the Holy Ghost so I
[1:22:20] came to this church
[1:22:22] wow
[1:22:24] why he said under Ministry and he sat
[1:22:26] there and kept sitting there kept
[1:22:28] sitting there
[1:22:29] it's kind of like us you know we want to
[1:22:30] be baptized but
[1:22:34] now don't put me in the water just give
[1:22:36] me a little you know give me a little no
[1:22:38] I want to go immerse me kill me
[1:22:41] that's what I want with the word of God
[1:22:43] I want it all or I don't want nothing
[1:22:45] and that's what you ought to think you
[1:22:47] ought to think the same thing but you
[1:22:48] know what you ask God say God I don't
[1:22:50] understand that man
[1:22:52] that's a lot of people said that about
[1:22:54] brother Brown Lord I don't understand
[1:22:56] what that man's saying
[1:22:58] but you said
[1:23:00] you'd never leave us
[1:23:02] or forsake us
[1:23:06] and if he moves on that means he left us
[1:23:09] no it means you left him
[1:23:12] because when he moves you move you know
[1:23:14] what brother Brown says when God moves
[1:23:15] you move he said when you stand still
[1:23:17] God's going to continue to move so you
[1:23:20] are hey I'm My Own Worst Enemy we all
[1:23:22] are
[1:23:24] if you don't understand something you
[1:23:25] just keep praying and keep praying and
[1:23:27] keep praying God's got to honor his word
[1:23:30] he's got to honor what he's already said
[1:23:32] he's got to adopt you you say no yes he
[1:23:35] does if he makes you a child of his then
[1:23:38] he's obligated but are you obligating
[1:23:41] yourself
[1:23:43] are you keeping yourself open for the
[1:23:45] word of God are you shutting the door
[1:23:47] and say I don't know about that I don't
[1:23:51] say Lord
[1:23:52] I don't understand at the moment
[1:23:55] but if you'll give me a little time
[1:23:57] that's what Louis said Lord give me a
[1:23:59] little time
[1:24:01] about three months later he said I
[1:24:03] started catching on that was three
[1:24:04] months
[1:24:05] that was pretty pretty slow
[1:24:17] and God had to meet him somewhere if
[1:24:20] you're a child of God God has to meet
[1:24:22] you somewhere
[1:24:23] he's got to he's obligated to his own
[1:24:26] children
[1:24:27] if you'll make yourself available
[1:24:32] thank God
[1:24:34] take me somewhere
[1:24:37] I want to know more about you but you
[1:24:38] know what I don't want to sit here and
[1:24:39] fight all the time
[1:24:41] I want to have some real good days
[1:24:43] strung in a row
[1:24:45] amen how many y'all want that
[1:24:48] a bunch of good days strong in a row
[1:24:50] yeah we'll have a good one and then oh I
[1:24:53] have a bad one
[1:24:55] now John they will have another bad one
[1:25:01] then you might have one day's kind of
[1:25:03] medium
[1:25:04] then you got a bad one
[1:25:06] and all of a sudden you'll pop up and
[1:25:07] say I got a good day no I want to strain
[1:25:10] them good days together
[1:25:11] because what's going to happen when we
[1:25:13] take a body change
[1:25:15] all them good days are going to be
[1:25:17] strung together for an eternity it's not
[1:25:19] gonna be up and down we don't even
[1:25:21] understand that
[1:25:23] how would you understand living
[1:25:24] somewhere for an eternity and not having
[1:25:26] an up and down day
[1:25:28] thank you
[1:25:29] ain't happening
[1:25:30] that's why we got to have this thing
[1:25:32] we've got to before it happens we got to
[1:25:36] believe it can happen
[1:25:38] we got to believe that God's already
[1:25:40] given us provision
[1:25:41] for the down days and the up days and
[1:25:44] he's God on the mountain is it God in
[1:25:46] the valley
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:50] it takes two mountains to make a valley
[1:25:54] amen so we need to be on the house on
[1:25:57] the top of the mountain twice than we
[1:25:58] are in the valley
[1:25:59] but sometimes we let the devil throw us
[1:26:02] in the valley and throw us in another
[1:26:03] Valley and just keep throwing us in the
[1:26:05] valley let's don't strain let's don't
[1:26:07] have ups and downs let's say God
[1:26:08] tomorrow
[1:26:10] I'm going to start new I'm gonna start
[1:26:11] fresh
[1:26:13] Satan you are on alert
[1:26:16] whatever you got to say you're lying
[1:26:20] I've heard this all my life
[1:26:23] I'm not going to yield to it anymore
[1:26:26] I'm going to be a new creation a brand
[1:26:29] new man you say well that's just power
[1:26:31] positive thinking start there
[1:26:36] start there
[1:26:38] and then brother Brown sound ready to
[1:26:40] you many times where he said a positive
[1:26:42] mental attitude to any word of God will
[1:26:45] bring into path positive mental attitude
[1:26:49] a lot of those people got healed on that
[1:26:51] platform he said a prostitute
[1:26:54] you know what that is
[1:26:57] a prostitute that's got all that oh
[1:27:02] God forbid
[1:27:03] all that in their mind of what their
[1:27:05] background is and what they're doing all
[1:27:07] they did they walked up in brother Brown
[1:27:09] said you've got this you got this you
[1:27:10] got this and inside they said
[1:27:13] I don't know I don't understand this but
[1:27:15] I believe what he's saying he said she'd
[1:27:18] get her healing
[1:27:19] where a Christian would walk up to the
[1:27:21] platform a true born-again Christian and
[1:27:24] then worry about everything and lose
[1:27:26] their healing
[1:27:28] so a positive mental attitude
[1:27:31] will bring every promise of God to pass
[1:27:33] try that start with that and now I
[1:27:36] promise you it'll move over into the
[1:27:39] next day's good the next day is good
[1:27:41] even if it's bad it's good
[1:27:45] what do we consider bad
[1:27:47] we don't consider what the world
[1:27:49] considers bad I hope you don't
[1:27:51] well I'm having a bad day
[1:27:53] we all have bad days I know that
[1:27:57] but with God
[1:27:59] I thought he had a bomb
[1:28:02] a bombing Gilead a bomb that you can't
[1:28:05] buy from Young Living you can't buy it
[1:28:07] from Amway you can't buy it from Avon
[1:28:10] there's a bombing Gilead that he'll wipe
[1:28:12] over that and smooth that thing out and
[1:28:14] you know what he'll make your day a lot
[1:28:17] brighter let's sing a song God bless you
[1:28:19] let's have the knowledge of God
[1:28:23] [Music]

[1:33:08] what I want you to understand we we say
[1:33:11] oh we don't have nothing we don't have
[1:33:13] this
[1:33:14] again
[1:33:15] you walked into a room
[1:33:17] to go to a wedding
[1:33:19] having no idea
[1:33:21] that somebody was watching you
[1:33:24] you did your job
[1:33:27] you were you
[1:33:30] you did what you'd usually do
[1:33:32] you help and you do and you talk and
[1:33:36] you're nice to people that's all you did
[1:33:39] and you impacted somebody's life
[1:33:42] to me that's the greatest gift anybody
[1:33:44] can have is to be able to give something
[1:33:46] and you don't know you give it
[1:33:49] to not know one thing about giving it
[1:33:51] but you give it
[1:33:53] River what are you doing I mean what you
[1:33:55] know bubbling up out of the ground what
[1:33:57] are you doing it's just something inside
[1:33:58] of me
[1:34:00] that keeps pushing up
[1:34:02] keeps pushing that water out and then we
