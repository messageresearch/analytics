[0:08] well the door's open i hope you saw
[0:11] what we saw
[0:26] and for all of you all the information
[0:28] today is my
[0:38] regina just said this morning
[0:41] how
[0:42] that
[1:09] you know if our son's been married 34
[1:12] here well mama
[1:14] yo mama
[1:16] man
[1:18] all right
[1:19] we're a little slim on crowd today but
[1:21] that's okay
[1:34] i heard a story uh the other day that
[1:38] it's kind of fitting with that you know
[1:39] we've been 34 years and this man said
[1:41] him and his wife been married about 30
[1:43] years and he bought her
[1:45] he said he was you know tired of her
[1:47] mood swings so he bought her a mood ring
[1:49] so he could know what move she was in
[1:53] and he said no this is what he said he
[1:55] said now it works wonderful he said
[1:58] there's only one problem he said now
[2:00] when it turns blue
[2:01] everything's fine
[2:04] he said but when she's in a bad mood
[2:07] he said it turns red about right here
[2:16] words of wisdom
[2:20] best 34 years of my life put it that way
[2:23] absolutely
[2:25] and i asked the same question for
[2:26] getting different i said there's no
[2:28] other woman
[2:30] there's no other woman that would have
[2:31] me so thank god she's whatever she is
[2:35] ignorant of it or whatever so
[2:38] she's the only one who can put up with
[2:40] him
[2:43] anyway all right now we're talking about
[2:46] knowledge now last sunday
[2:49] we ended up with
[2:51] a word that i want to give you a
[2:52] definition of
[2:54] and i don't i don't
[2:59] why is it not over there
[3:01] yeah everything's gone but what i want
[3:29] not yet
[3:33] supposed to be on up there but it's
[3:35] probably coming
[3:36] look there you go no secrets there's no
[3:38] signals
[3:57] for those of you that are
[3:59] for those of you that were not here
[4:02] last sunday we were talking about
[4:07] the word knowledge
[4:08] now the word knowledge means what
[4:12] somebody had somebody else look it up
[4:14] i'll give you another week to look it up
[4:17] knowledge
[4:18] i have information
[4:23] okay
[4:24] um acceptance of the truth or existence
[4:27] of something
[4:29] the greatest possible amount of
[4:32] knowledge of god
[4:34] proceeds from observations or
[4:37] experiences
[4:38] a desire for
[4:41] extensive or specialized about a subject
[4:44] okay
[4:47] how about the word intelligence
[4:54] about the word intelligence
[5:00] intelligence
[5:03] or revelation
[5:08] and information
[5:11] but the key word i want to look in
[5:13] knowledge in the statue of a perfect man
[5:16] has nothing to do with human
[5:18] ability to add subtract multiply
[5:22] know the 50 states
[5:25] even though you're on social security no
[5:28] to me it means discernment
[5:30] now look at this word discernment maybe
[5:33] some of you can say i can't make this
[5:34] any bigger
[5:35] but um
[5:38] look at the word discernment the quality
[5:40] of being able to grasp
[5:43] and comprehend what is obscure
[5:47] so the knowledge of god is obscure to
[5:48] man
[5:50] okay
[5:51] the knowledge of god is totally obscure
[5:53] to man because the knowledge of god is
[5:55] i can make a world
[5:58] the knowledge of man is i don't see how
[6:01] right
[6:02] and i don't see how you make a world
[6:04] well god just says i can make one
[6:06] okay so the knowledge is an obscure
[6:10] it's an obscurity
[6:12] all right it's the ability to see and
[6:15] understand people things or situations
[6:17] clearly
[6:18] and intelligently all right now that's
[6:20] man's definition
[6:22] but i like that one right there
[6:25] the quality of being able to grasp
[6:28] and comprehend what is obscure yeah
[6:32] all right
[6:33] the word of god is totally obscure
[6:35] even the word of god that we see
[6:38] see the word of god in the statue of a
[6:39] perfect man
[6:40] is not
[6:42] denominational knowledge
[6:46] okay
[6:47] it's not denominational knowledge
[6:49] because their knowledge is is more
[6:50] obscure than ever
[6:52] because it's not by the bible because so
[6:54] you have to take
[6:56] what does discernment do
[6:58] it
[6:59] the act of perceiving or discerning
[7:01] something all right well that's the same
[7:03] thing
[7:04] is knowledge you got to have knowledge
[7:09] or intelligence
[7:11] right now if you're born again you do
[7:13] have the intelligence of god
[7:17] if you're born again if you're born
[7:20] again you have the intelligence
[7:22] of god
[7:24] everybody got them
[7:26] you have the intelligence of god
[7:29] if you're born again now
[7:33] if you receive all that you need at the
[7:35] new birth that's what brother brown said
[7:37] but faith alone won't do it
[7:39] that means you've got a
[7:41] storehouse
[7:44] in your soul
[7:45] if you're born again
[7:47] you have a storehouse of all these
[7:50] virtues
[7:53] you can go get them when you want them
[8:00] somebody else can't come and get yours
[8:03] now they can feed off of yours
[8:05] but they can't come and get your
[8:07] knowledge they can't come and get your
[8:08] virtue all right
[8:10] and it's got to come from within
[8:13] now
[8:15] in hosea 6 and 6 we're just going to
[8:18] read a few
[8:19] scriptures he said i desired mercy and
[8:22] not sacrificed and the knowledge of god
[8:25] more than burnt offering so he desire
[8:27] now jose knew that burnt offerings was
[8:29] the way to get to god right because
[8:30] that's the way that he that was ordained
[8:32] for people to get to god was to make a
[8:34] sacrifice
[8:35] but he said i desire the knowledge of
[8:37] god more than that why because burnt
[8:41] offerings is only going to do one thing
[8:42] for you it's going to make you be aware
[8:45] that there's sin
[8:46] right
[8:47] but it's not going to take away your sin
[8:51] burnt offerings you know sacrificing
[8:53] offerings i would it's not but a body
[8:54] though has prepared me all right so the
[8:56] body of god is where all these things
[8:58] were are still are
[9:00] but now look
[9:09] right here
[9:10] in first corinthians 15 34
[9:12] it says awake to righteousness
[9:16] and sin not for some have not the
[9:18] knowledge of god
[9:20] some have not the knowledge of god
[9:22] all right
[9:24] i speak this to your shame
[9:29] await the righteousness and say no it's
[9:31] talking to christian people right
[9:33] but some have not the knowledge of god
[9:36] now remember
[9:38] to be born again
[9:40] means you have all these virtues like i
[9:42] said in a storehouse
[9:44] all right you're the one who can draw
[9:46] from it or you can keep the door shut
[9:47] one of the two all right so that's your
[9:50] all these are that's why i don't i don't
[9:52] understand these people that says
[9:54] you know that we don't have a choice and
[9:56] then
[9:57] you know
[9:58] the world this
[10:00] this whole
[10:03] christian experience is is due to choice
[10:07] and is affected by choice
[10:09] you remember that one more time
[10:12] it's due to our choosing we became a
[10:14] christian
[10:16] and then our choice continues on if we
[10:18] want to continue on with god
[10:20] so we don't stop choosing
[10:23] now you you know
[10:24] brother brown said he said you know you
[10:25] weren't born on any certain day and you
[10:27] you weren't you know you always were
[10:29] eternal that's correct
[10:31] but there had to come a point in time
[10:33] where you made yourself available
[10:36] for the word
[10:38] to be
[10:40] for those virtues to be birthed in you
[10:43] all right
[10:45] now we know the new birth is the birth
[10:46] of the word it's the birth of almighty
[10:48] god in your soul burning out the old
[10:50] nature and putting him in right
[10:53] right he wasn't there to begin with
[10:57] you were black brother brown said your
[10:59] soul was black darkness all right
[11:01] so there was no light there
[11:03] but there was a representation
[11:06] see that's why god give you a statue of
[11:08] a perfect man somebody's gonna attain to
[11:10] that or you want to give it
[11:13] all right
[11:14] just like which one did he create first
[11:16] the water
[11:17] or the fin on the fish's back are the
[11:19] scales on the fish's back or the water
[11:20] first
[11:21] he created the water
[11:23] all right
[11:24] he created the thirst and and i got a
[11:27] quote um
[11:28] it's a little bit off what we're talking
[11:30] about but it's really not because let's
[11:32] go back to discernment and knowledge
[11:34] brother brown said every creation of
[11:36] every man was a creation of god
[11:38] and there was a
[11:40] part of god
[11:44] in that person in the
[11:46] in the part that we need something
[11:49] to
[11:51] worship
[11:52] remember he put that in everybody he put
[11:54] that ability to worship man every man
[11:56] even adolf hitler is given the ability
[11:59] to worship god
[12:01] right so that puts everybody on a level
[12:02] playing field
[12:04] all right but what he done was
[12:06] brother i said then you have a choice
[12:08] whether to turn that desire
[12:11] everybody's got a desire to serve god
[12:14] even the hot tots in africa even people
[12:16] never heard of jesus christ they've all
[12:18] got a desire
[12:20] because of the creator to worship god so
[12:23] there's that deep calling to the deep
[12:25] what you've done was god knew you would
[12:27] respond to the word
[12:29] and that adolf hitler would not respond
[12:31] to the word he responded to greed power
[12:35] and all the things that that's perverted
[12:38] because satan was given a permitted
[12:40] power
[12:42] he was a right-hand man he was god's
[12:43] first creation really i mean as far as
[12:45] creating angels he was the first one
[12:47] right beside of him brother brown said
[12:49] but what did he do he took that desire
[12:52] to worship
[12:53] god
[12:54] and he worshipped himself
[12:57] self-worship and that's the problem with
[12:58] people nowadays you look out in the
[13:00] world now self-worship why it's layout
[13:03] sea of people's rights
[13:05] i have a right to do this i have a right
[13:07] to do that that's my rights it's me i
[13:09] have a privilege and a right to do that
[13:11] so but anyway we've got to have this
[13:13] knowledge
[13:14] which is not just
[13:16] how much you can quote
[13:19] how much you can read the bible and say
[13:20] well i've read every page and i can cite
[13:22] you know
[13:23] uh
[13:25] brother stephen abraham from uh where is
[13:28] he from ap or wherever he was from where
[13:30] was stephen from
[13:32] trinidad
[13:33] he could stand up you he could stand up
[13:36] there and he could
[13:37] you pick out a psalm and he could just
[13:40] right out of his mouth
[13:42] well see without holy ghost knowledge
[13:44] that's just man's knowledge
[13:46] that's just being able to uh saw
[13:48] somebody on the internet last night this
[13:50] guy
[13:51] you can talk to him for like 30 minutes
[13:53] to 45 minutes and he retains everything
[13:56] you say and he can say exactly what you
[13:58] said
[13:59] he's that
[14:01] in tune with
[14:04] what his natural intelligence his brain
[14:08] because remember
[14:09] most of us only use our 10 capacity of
[14:12] our brain
[14:14] some only has 10 capacity of the brain
[14:18] but you know what i think
[14:20] i think god gave us a brain brother
[14:23] brother branham had a brain
[14:27] but he had a conscious that was a little
[14:28] bit closer to his subconscious why he
[14:31] was given a gift he was made that way
[14:33] right but i believe we were made in the
[14:35] image of god so i believe we were given
[14:37] a brain
[14:38] that they want with to have the
[14:40] knowledge of god
[14:43] but it's got to come from discernment
[14:46] because you're an individual
[14:49] it doesn't go by individual knowledge
[14:52] everybody understand when i say
[14:53] knowledge when i say knowledge don't get
[14:55] in your mind that will well this this
[14:57] person can
[14:58] can can speak better than i can or this
[15:00] person went to 40 14 years in college
[15:04] brother brown said the most illiterate
[15:06] person can receive the new birth
[15:08] peter one of the most illiterate people
[15:10] in the bible had these virtues working
[15:13] in his life
[15:15] actually that probably
[15:16] kept him from being hindered so much
[15:21] you know what he does he's believed god
[15:23] right he believed god
[15:25] he said god you said it i've been with
[15:26] you i was with you the whole time i
[15:28] think peter's
[15:29] peter's whole
[15:31] um well i want to say peter's
[15:34] greatest ability when jesus was here
[15:37] peter paid
[15:38] attention i believe peter paid attention
[15:41] because you gotta remember in the
[15:42] scripture he's always saying lord you yo
[15:44] lord you did this you who's touching me
[15:46] and peter said lord everybody's touching
[15:47] you peter was aware
[15:49] of something that was going on but he
[15:50] just couldn't get it get his brain
[15:52] wrapped around it you know because he
[15:53] didn't have the holy ghost but when you
[15:55] have the holy ghost and you bring it
[15:57] into a brain
[15:59] of course it's not in your brain but you
[16:00] understand what i mean it works through
[16:03] all that all right your outlets in your
[16:05] brain
[16:06] then you must have not just regular
[16:08] knowledge but discernment
[16:10] discernment to me is the bottom line
[16:13] because you know what you're going to
[16:15] need it when you get to temperance
[16:20] without discernment you're gonna get mad
[16:22] at things that you shouldn't get mad at
[16:25] come on
[16:26] without discernment
[16:29] you know why because i do
[16:32] without a little discernment i didn't
[16:33] have it before
[16:35] without some discernment
[16:37] it's hard
[16:40] but that discernment is knowledge
[16:43] and there's one thing for sure though
[16:46] i don't know if i got on this one but i
[16:47] got it somewhere
[16:49] god is not going to just give you
[16:51] knowledge
[16:53] as far as saying okay
[16:55] you've got the holy ghost so you don't
[16:56] need this
[16:59] because the holy ghost is god right
[17:02] right the holy ghost is the holy spirit
[17:03] the one that created all things the one
[17:05] on the chart that we did a couple weeks
[17:07] ago that's what came to you at the new
[17:09] birth the christ the logos of theophany
[17:12] of god the word form of god the creator
[17:14] the seed of god all that came into new
[17:16] birth but now
[17:18] he didn't say all right you got it all
[17:22] you can do yes all you you got it all
[17:24] but you gotta go settle you go sit over
[17:26] here and i'll just pour it in you
[17:28] because god can't go past his word
[17:31] his word says that you have to come to
[17:33] church
[17:34] you have to read your bible you have to
[17:36] communicate with god yourself
[17:39] all right see that's the problem with
[17:40] the catholic church they want to
[17:42] communicate with one man the priest
[17:45] and then let the priest take everything
[17:46] to god
[17:47] right well that's not what the bible
[17:49] says
[17:50] now he gives you a five-fold ministry
[17:53] to perfect the saints so the only way
[17:55] you're gonna get it is you're gonna get
[17:56] it by
[17:58] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[18:00] evangelists you're not going to get it
[18:01] from one person that's why you're not
[18:03] going to get it from brother branham off
[18:04] the tapes
[18:06] by yourself
[18:08] even though the holy ghost is in there
[18:10] with all that
[18:14] kind of strange it's kind of hard but
[18:16] you're not going to get it by saying the
[18:18] homelessness because see that's not what
[18:19] the word of god said all right where god
[18:22] said you're only going to be perfected
[18:23] by a five-fold ministry
[18:25] all right
[18:26] and doing the things of god
[18:29] all right
[18:29] and it's okay to have earthly knowledge
[18:31] it's all right it's okay to uh
[18:34] one key to a lot of you of course a lot
[18:36] of you are older and don't have little
[18:37] kids but there's knowledge there
[18:40] reading
[18:43] reading you perceive more
[18:46] you need to read
[18:48] and
[18:49] you know
[18:50] that's what i did i read a lot i read a
[18:53] lot of my study books and i didn't have
[18:55] to do so much as far as homework at all
[18:57] actually none
[18:59] and but i listened in class i paid
[19:01] attention
[19:02] i did gyms a lot of time
[19:04] because she was thinking about me
[19:07] while she was in the classroom
[19:11] and she wasn't there
[19:14] in bonnie only
[19:17] where was that
[19:20] that was 35 years ago
[19:23] on 34 that was 35 years ago joyce and
[19:25] danny's got one
[19:28] there
[19:29] is jacob
[19:31] that's right jacob's just today
[19:33] yeah he texted me last night and i
[19:34] texted him back told him i said he said
[19:36] don't forget i said you better not
[19:38] forget
[19:39] so yours is number one mine is number 34
[19:41] it's a little different you know
[19:43] in missing one and number 34 so
[19:46] happy anniversary to jacob
[19:51] but listen you gotta have
[19:53] you got what you say
[20:00] discernment
[20:01] as long as they know that yeah as long
[20:03] as i know
[20:07] but when we discern things what do you
[20:09] do when you discern things that means
[20:11] you take what's saith
[20:13] right because right here says the
[20:15] ability
[20:17] to see and understand people things or
[20:20] situations clearly
[20:23] and intelligently there's no way you can
[20:25] discern the things of god without
[20:27] knowing the things of god
[20:30] the basic like trudy said you get it in
[20:32] a baby form well the baby makes mistakes
[20:35] the baby falls down the baby babbles the
[20:37] baby cries
[20:38] the baby because they don't have any
[20:40] other way of communicating
[20:42] but now if you'll have stayed that way
[20:46] ten years from now
[20:48] there's a problem somewhere there's a
[20:50] deficiency
[20:52] in that child
[20:53] and you see a lot of christians that way
[20:55] but you know why
[20:56] because they don't have a good set of
[20:58] parents
[20:59] i'm talking spiritually now not nothing
[21:01] not grinding them i think they're
[21:02] wondering
[21:03] but spiritually they don't get the right
[21:06] parents
[21:07] and they stay babies
[21:11] brother brown calls it mental deficiency
[21:12] and that's what it is it's a mental
[21:14] deficiency but it's not a mental
[21:15] deficiency as far as
[21:17] humanly it's a mental deficiency because
[21:19] of the word of god because you know you
[21:20] can only
[21:22] you can only get if your pastor's right
[21:24] here
[21:25] that's as far as you're going
[21:28] you're not going
[21:29] unless you hear somewhere else
[21:33] and you'll go to that
[21:35] because if this pastor is preaching here
[21:36] and this one's down here and you're
[21:38] ordained to listen and get it and know
[21:40] what god's doing then you know what
[21:42] you're going to do automatically the the
[21:45] god in you not you most of the time
[21:48] the god in you is going to move you over
[21:50] here
[21:50] because he knows how far you're going to
[21:52] go we don't
[21:54] that's why it's a mystery
[21:56] but it's you and i
[21:58] still having a choice now what if i knew
[22:01] this was over here
[22:03] but stayed over here
[22:06] what if i knew this was here and i
[22:08] stayed here does that mean
[22:11] well that means one thing for sure
[22:13] i may not even have
[22:15] faith yeah in your birth
[22:18] you got it
[22:20] i mean that's pretty simple to me if you
[22:22] hear a word that's this that calls your
[22:25] name not your name physically but your
[22:27] name in it you can't you contact that
[22:29] you connect yourself to that to that and
[22:32] yet you stay over here and just keep
[22:33] drinking milk and drinking milk and
[22:35] drinking milk drinking milk there's
[22:36] something wrong somewhere
[22:39] forgive me class but can you back up you
[22:41] were you were saying about reading
[22:44] and then you were saying you listened in
[22:46] class
[22:46] and i need to get back there because i
[22:48] got to move on
[22:49] you're saying you get more from reading
[22:51] and then from harry just puts the icing
[22:53] on the cake is that where that's correct
[22:56] yes
[22:57] i would re i can comprehend what i read
[23:01] but you still got to listen to somebody
[23:03] somebody a teacher's got to put it
[23:05] together
[23:06] you can't take and read
[23:09] you can physically read acts 238 and you
[23:12] can physically read
[23:14] matthew 28 19.
[23:16] without discernment the right kind of
[23:18] discernment
[23:19] you're going to say those two are
[23:21] contrary so i'm going to take the one
[23:22] jesus said now that's what they do out
[23:24] in the in the denominational world right
[23:26] well i'll tell you what jesus said over
[23:27] what peter said
[23:30] well with discernment in the knowledge
[23:32] of god they're saying the same thing
[23:33] right
[23:35] yes
[23:36] but now you can't get that from just
[23:38] reading
[23:40] now some might
[23:41] but remember faith comes by
[23:45] hearing
[23:47] faith comes by hearing
[23:48] in acts 2 when the holy ghost fell
[23:51] it wasn't the speaking
[23:54] it was they heard
[23:56] in their own language
[23:58] okay so that's what you're doing today
[24:00] you're discerning
[24:02] remember when you have preachers come up
[24:03] and they freak something a little bit
[24:04] off and you're you're discerning the
[24:06] whole time your computer's turning
[24:09] and what are you dealing with
[24:11] discernment of the knowledge that you
[24:13] already have yes
[24:16] okay you're you're using the discernment
[24:19] of the knowledge you already have
[24:21] because we're we have been taught well
[24:23] here
[24:25] right yeah yes other people
[24:28] have not been taught well so they'll
[24:30] they'll hear a sermon of of two souls or
[24:33] or we're gonna get a new body or
[24:34] whatever and they'll just shout and
[24:36] why
[24:38] they're not you they don't have anything
[24:39] to discern with
[24:42] you gotta have a basis
[24:44] what i'm saying is you got to have faith
[24:47] you got to draw strength from virtue
[24:49] from the word of god then you have to
[24:50] have knowledge that that word of god is
[24:52] right but you got to have knowledge
[24:53] you've got to go get it somewhere that
[24:55] god's not going to just open your head
[24:56] and start pouring it down in you okay
[24:59] so you can read it
[25:01] but you got to hear it
[25:04] how can they hear
[25:06] without a
[25:07] preacher
[25:09] so you can't
[25:10] now not that you got not physically
[25:12] hearing you understand what i mean when
[25:14] brother when brother brown and brother
[25:16] dale or any preacher says do you see
[25:18] what i'm saying it's not do you
[25:20] see what i'm saying
[25:23] it's do you see or understand or do you
[25:25] discern what i'm saying
[25:28] okay do you know what i'm talking about
[25:31] right
[25:32] and then that's why we bring quotes and
[25:34] scriptures
[25:36] because you bring quotes and scriptures
[25:37] and you put the thing together that's
[25:39] what brother brown done many people in
[25:41] this message take brother brown's
[25:42] message and say
[25:44] this is right and this is wrong
[25:48] okay
[25:49] if he made a mistake he is the one that
[25:52] corrected
[25:53] okay because you can't correct the
[25:54] prophet
[25:55] he's corrected by god alone all right
[25:57] so we can't say let's think about it
[26:00] this morning all these people that say
[26:01] well that was before 63. well if them
[26:04] people want to just take 63 to 65 then
[26:07] don't ever quote anything past that
[26:09] throw those books away
[26:11] throw those tapes away because what
[26:13] you're saying is he didn't know anything
[26:15] until 1963. now that's not right
[26:18] he was born a prophet and sure there was
[26:20] things in his ministry that he had
[26:22] progressive revelation he had to go up
[26:24] that pyramid just like you and i did
[26:27] yeah brother brown started one time
[26:30] with faith
[26:32] he went to that whatever that was wood
[26:33] shed and all that and he
[26:35] got the holy ghost well now when he got
[26:38] the holy ghost
[26:39] he always already was an ordained
[26:41] prophet
[26:42] so the holy ghost come and enhance that
[26:47] okay so the prophet can be a false
[26:49] prophet
[26:50] not have the holy ghost but if you have
[26:51] a prophet with the holy ghost
[26:54] you put them two together you can't
[26:56] make a mistake you understand what i'm
[26:58] saying he makes human mistakes like
[27:00] seven hundred seven thousand that has
[27:02] nothing to do with what the word of god
[27:04] is
[27:05] okay
[27:07] that's a slip of the tongue
[27:08] you know daddy will say adam and mean
[27:10] moses you know what
[27:12] your knowledge discerns that that's
[27:14] right the only reason i ever try to
[27:16] correct him is is because people on that
[27:18] internet
[27:19] because they sit there and pick every
[27:21] word
[27:22] and if you miss one word they'll go
[27:25] because i've heard them do it you know
[27:27] so you have to be real precise not for
[27:29] us
[27:30] but for the ones that are listening or
[27:32] watching on the internet so
[27:34] we want to try to keep everything in
[27:35] line and keep everything straight but
[27:38] with
[27:39] holy ghost discernment or knowledge
[27:42] the bible said it'll lead you and guide
[27:44] you into what all truth and i didn't say
[27:47] right all true
[27:49] that's why knowledge you would think
[27:52] you would i would think if i was going
[27:54] to build this pyramid see because here i
[27:55] am that's god's knowledge i'm not god so
[27:58] i would put knowledge on it for a little
[27:59] bit i put temperance down there where i
[28:00] could control my temper first
[28:03] but he gives us knowledge and
[28:04] discernment the third thing
[28:07] he gives us knowledge and discernment to
[28:09] do what
[28:10] because when we get to temperance we
[28:12] know how to handle it
[28:14] because the knowledge of god will tell
[28:15] you how to handle a situation
[28:18] so it's exactly perfectly where it
[28:21] should be
[28:23] because if you don't have knowledge of
[28:24] it
[28:25] doesn't matter if you get mad or blow up
[28:27] or say something you shouldn't say but
[28:29] if you have a knowledge of it every one
[28:31] of these things to me is a is a check
[28:33] off it's like
[28:34] it's like boy said i i won't i would
[28:37] love for all of y'all to to find out
[28:39] where you are
[28:41] in this pyramid
[28:43] and point to it like boyd did he said i
[28:45] need temper
[28:47] okay
[28:48] does that mean he's got faith virtue
[28:49] knowledge
[28:50] not all of it but maybe some of it he at
[28:52] least realizes
[28:54] right there's where i need to work on
[28:58] okay
[29:00] see i need to work on being more like
[29:02] god
[29:03] that's what i need to do work on being
[29:05] more like god because godliness brother
[29:07] random didn't spend a lot of time on it
[29:09] he said that's to be like god well you
[29:12] can't
[29:13] you can't
[29:15] what am i going to say here you can't
[29:17] build on that anymore
[29:20] because here's how to be like god
[29:22] so you got to get to this
[29:25] then you you can't be a walking zombie
[29:26] you can't say well i'm going to be like
[29:27] god so i'm going to
[29:29] me and jim's not you're going to divorce
[29:31] after 34 years and i'm going to go over
[29:33] into a monastery and i'm going to do
[29:35] nothing but just in the morning in the
[29:37] afternoon and evening i'm just going to
[29:38] pray that's not what god wants
[29:42] that would drive you crazy
[29:44] me especially
[29:46] you know so
[29:49] it's not that way it's not that we're
[29:50] going to be
[29:52] um
[29:54] god robots
[29:56] i heard one time a man say he was uh he
[29:59] was william brown's parakeet
[30:01] well i
[30:02] i don't want to do that
[30:04] because the parakeet only
[30:06] states
[30:08] to me that's belittling yourself
[30:10] for the parakeet only states what he
[30:12] hears he has no revelation of what he's
[30:14] saying
[30:16] right he has no revelation apparently he
[30:18] has no revelation of what he says
[30:21] i want to be my own individual person
[30:26] have the knowledge and the discernment
[30:27] to know that brother branham was the
[30:29] problem what he said was right from 47
[30:32] to 65 that you can blend all that
[30:34] together and it all works into a
[30:37] beautiful picture well once you do that
[30:38] then
[30:39] it's kind of like i was telling you all
[30:41] the other day about some people have the
[30:43] cow the grass they got all the
[30:45] components of a picture
[30:48] but if you take that cow and put it in
[30:50] the top of the tree and grass what does
[30:52] it do to that picture doesn't matter how
[30:53] beautiful the picture is
[30:55] doesn't matter if it's in high
[30:56] definition quality
[30:58] it's worthless
[31:00] it's not true
[31:02] the cow can't eat grass on top of a tree
[31:04] it's not true so it makes the whole
[31:06] thing called
[31:08] pretty wild huh
[31:09] we better go i'm losing time here
[31:11] i wonder if that cloth
[31:14] the ding dong hadn't went off yet
[31:16] okay all right let's go up front we'll
[31:18] we'll work on discernment next next
[31:21] sunday i i won't be here next sunday i'm
[31:23] going to dutch scots he called me and
[31:24] i'm going to preach for him next sunday
[31:26] so bob will be here next time
[31:29] and we'll continue after that
[31:34] y'all be careful i'm going up front
[31:37] there won't be no seats everybody's just
[31:39] churchill you said todd dale was here
