[2:31] endeavor to go into your word Lord Jesus
[2:33] name Amen amen that's turning in the
[2:38] gospel the gospel of Saint Luke the 14th
[2:43] chapter and start at the at the let's
[2:50] see that'd be the 16th verse and st.
[2:55] Luke 1416 then then said he unto Him a
[3:04] certain man made a great supper and bed
[3:08] many and and sent his servants and sent
[3:14] his servants at supper time to say unto
[3:17] them that were bidden come for all
[3:21] things are now ready and they and they
[3:25] were and they with one consent began to
[3:31] make excuses the first said unto him I
[3:35] have bought a piece of ground and I must
[3:40] need go see it go and see it I pray thee
[3:46] have me excused in another said I have
[3:49] bought a a five yoke I have bought five
[3:53] yoke of oxen and I go to prove them
[3:57] I pray thee have me excused another said
[4:01] I have married a wife and therefore I
[4:04] cannot come notice so the servant came
[4:08] and showed his Lord these things then
[4:13] the master of the house began being
[4:18] angry said unto the servant remember it
[4:21] says servant not servants said unto the
[4:24] servant go quickly unto the streets
[4:27] and unto the lanes and unto the city and
[4:32] bring hither the poor and the maimed and
[4:35] the halt and the blind and the servant
[4:39] said and the servant said Lord it is
[4:43] done and
[4:44] has that has commanded and yet there is
[4:47] room and the Lord said unto the servant
[4:52] go out into the highways and into the
[4:56] hedges and compel them to come and in
[5:01] that my house may be filled filled for I
[5:05] say unto you
[5:07] none of those whom met those men whom
[5:11] were bidden shall taste of my supper a
[5:15] man s bar has once again our dear Lord
[5:19] Jesus were grateful or God first of all
[5:22] for your work and Lord Jesus we pray O
[5:24] Lord goddess we go into your the rest of
[5:28] the ministry Lord God I pray O Lord you
[5:30] bless us all in Jesus name Amen
[5:33] bless your word amen and I also read the
[5:38] it's almost a similar story that Matthew
[5:41] talks about Matthew 22 1:14 he talks
[5:45] about that same same incident when
[5:48] others had other excuses but you'll find
[5:51] out that the call to this gospel has
[5:55] gone out you know if you look at it that
[5:59] call went out when Jesus was there that
[6:02] call has gone out when Jesus came back
[6:04] in this day and age in the message of
[6:07] this hour that call went out to bring
[6:10] bring in those that were invited bring
[6:13] in the Pentecostal people bring in those
[6:16] that have that that are talking about
[6:18] the restoration of the gifts bring in
[6:20] those that that that understand that
[6:23] that that God is doing works like he
[6:26] used to do in the in the Old Testament I
[6:29] got a cough drop in my mouth so if I
[6:31] sound funny bear with me because my
[6:34] throat's not helping me much just work
[6:36] the same evening but so you find out
[6:39] anything flies please just
[6:41] don't let it hit your eyeballs one time
[6:46] I was preaching enough and I noticed a
[6:49] little bit of slobber going out and Isis
[6:51] Isis uh and quickly I just said
[6:54] say it don't spray it
[6:58] I'm sorry brother so but nevertheless
[7:04] bear with me just pray for me for my
[7:07] throat a little bit but there's water up
[7:10] here but let me let you know that that
[7:13] call went out that call went out to the
[7:15] Pentecostal people to bring them in to
[7:18] the to be the Bride of Christ but it
[7:22] wasn't in the Pentecostal people and the
[7:25] ministry so jealous of the of the power
[7:28] of God moving within the message of this
[7:30] hour within one man that they said how
[7:34] can this man lead us all how can this
[7:36] message be the only message out there
[7:39] you know and now it comes down to like
[7:42] one time I was talking to my dog my
[7:46] sister-in-law married to my my my
[7:50] brother-in-law Daniel and and and or
[7:54] just yeah that would be a sister-in-law
[7:56] and I she asked me and she asked me why
[8:00] I've made some mistakes here I called
[8:02] Joseph some more that he wasn't okay but
[8:06] I came down and I and she said how can
[8:09] it be that you're met that the message
[8:12] you're talking about is the only thing
[8:14] out there you know how could it be you
[8:17] must have a real big head to think that
[8:20] you're the only word of God that that's
[8:22] here on the land today I says I've been
[8:25] to many bunches of churches find your
[8:28] people than you are nicer people than
[8:31] you are more considerate people than you
[8:34] are and and yet you say you're the only
[8:37] church there is and I thought to myself
[8:40] like brother Brown said one time he says
[8:42] Lord when he said to that that infidel
[8:45] he said lord help me to be able to say
[8:47] something to her I said the same thing
[8:49] Lord help me put in my heart something
[8:52] to say to her in a and I waited a little
[8:55] bit and all of a sudden they started
[8:56] coming Isis you know that's an
[8:58] interesting question I said if it was
[9:03] that we were in Noah's day I said and
[9:06] Noah was standing at the door of the Ark
[9:09] bring on the ark every day in this
[9:10] family there and you're standing there
[9:12] looking at the Ark being built and all
[9:15] of science is telling you there's no
[9:17] such a thing that's roister up in the
[9:18] air in the atmosphere and you're
[9:21] standing there I says would you have
[9:24] gotten in the ark and she says of course
[9:26] I would
[9:27] okay I says come down to the days of
[9:31] Moses I says if Moses was what's calling
[9:35] the people out and telling them to give
[9:38] up the world give up the the fun things
[9:42] the joys of this of this world and come
[9:45] and be a separate people be at different
[9:49] people and it is served the Living God
[9:53] because our fathers worse was telling us
[9:56] through the word that were to leave
[9:59] Egypt under our strong hand in the
[10:01] mighty arm would you have followed Moses
[10:03] she's of course I'd have followed Moses
[10:07] this is okay
[10:08] I says in the days of Jesus if you would
[10:12] have been there and describes him you
[10:14] were part of the scribes and Pharisees
[10:16] in that religious order of that day and
[10:18] he comes and tells you follow me like he
[10:22] told the rich young ruler but yet he
[10:27] said give away all your riches to the
[10:30] poor and come follow me become a poor
[10:33] man like I am and come follow me would
[10:36] you have given up all your riches to
[10:38] follow Jesus Jesus of course I would
[10:43] this is okay now you ask me that
[10:46] question about the message of this hour
[10:49] I says we have come to a day we see the
[10:54] pillar of fire once again in our mist
[10:56] we've come to a day where God is raising
[11:00] up the dead healing cancers power the
[11:03] power of God's manifesting itself
[11:05] amongst us again I said and will you
[11:08] step out of your denominations because
[11:11] he said come out of her my people be not
[11:14] partakers of her sin and be part of this
[11:17] truth that's been given would you step
[11:20] into this message she says
[11:23] yeah I can see what you means but she
[11:27] did never come so we stand here and we
[11:33] look that many our bid many are called
[11:37] many are called there's a call gone out
[11:39] and there's a call gone out to the
[11:42] masses not just to the sick there was a
[11:45] healing service not just a sick you look
[11:47] at the pictures in all the all the books
[11:50] and you see the masses of people that
[11:53] were coming for the healing where are
[11:55] they where are they today where are
[11:59] their kids for their family they should
[12:01] be here they should crowd this church so
[12:04] crowded you couldn't fit another person
[12:06] in here they should be lined up outside
[12:08] my goodness this place would be packed
[12:14] out all the time why because there's a
[12:17] word of god that's coming our our but
[12:20] where are they the healing service is
[12:23] done by now there's a call to the masses
[12:25] there's a call go out to the highways to
[12:29] the corners to the calling them they'll
[12:31] compel people to come there's a
[12:34] compelling that's gone out now the Word
[12:37] of God is compelling people to come and
[12:39] now you come to a place where you're
[12:41] standing here and you start to think
[12:43] well how am I playing into this scenario
[12:48] okay so uh so we start to look at at the
[12:53] at the day we're living in now let's
[12:59] move over to another scripture you know
[13:02] there's been a let's go over to when you
[13:10] see where's my scripture Matthew 16 and
[13:16] 13 let's move over to Matthew 16 and 13
[13:20] bear with me because I'm working with my
[13:23] wife's Bible which I'm not familiar with
[13:25] but it was smaller and it fit the
[13:27] suitcase back
[13:30] ah the C orange Matthew 16 mix Matthew
[13:50] 16 and 13 then Jesus came unto the unto
[13:54] the coasts of Caesarea of Philippi and
[13:57] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[14:00] men say that I the Son of Man am and
[14:06] they said aunty and they said some say
[14:09] that thou art John the Baptist some say
[14:13] Elias some Elias and others Jeremias
[14:18] Jeremias and one of the of the prophets
[14:23] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[14:27] that I am and Simon Peter answered and
[14:32] said unto him thou art the Christ the
[14:34] Son of the Living God well from a
[14:36] belieber standpoint yeah he could say
[14:38] that now I got a question for you if we
[14:43] take a look at the scriptures and we
[14:47] look at the different things that God
[14:49] when when they are where I wound does
[14:52] men say that I am the disciples only
[14:55] said a few things there was a lot more
[14:58] said about who Jesus was if you look at
[15:02] it some said that he was a bad man for
[15:06] he took a whip of cords and started
[15:08] turning over the money changers and
[15:13] excuse me turning over the money
[15:16] changers and I would take a I take that
[15:23] Oh
[15:24] turning over the money changers and and
[15:26] now and and and and sending out the
[15:30] Sheep and letting all the doves and and
[15:33] the zeal of his house what consumed him
[15:37] and you find out that that G the people
[15:40] that were that there
[15:42] scribes and Pharisees that were sending
[15:44] there says he's a madman he's a
[15:46] terrorist he's some kind of crazy man he
[15:50] wants to make a make everybody then then
[15:54] you say well and then then others said
[15:56] no well he wants to can bring division
[16:00] amongst us because he preached he said
[16:03] let the letter if you look in now if he
[16:08] preached saying that that in Matthew 10
[16:11] 30 feet that that turn he came to bring
[16:15] division he says he's going to turn it a
[16:17] father against his son and a son against
[16:21] his dad in a and a mother-in-law against
[16:23] her daughter-in-law and a daughter
[16:25] against her mother and that's also in
[16:28] st. Luke out of Saint Luke 12 53 where
[16:34] it seems that he's bringing division
[16:36] amongst the people in this and they
[16:39] stood there saying he wants to make us
[16:41] he wants to divide out people unto
[16:44] himself and not be part of the religious
[16:47] organization we have here not part of
[16:50] Moses's teachings and some some said
[16:55] said in that day they said out well some
[17:00] said he was born in sin some son said
[17:03] that he was his mother was was was
[17:06] pregnant before she came together with
[17:07] Joseph and so she he was the
[17:09] illegitimate born in sin and the law
[17:13] says that and any illegitimate child
[17:15] can't even come into the congregation of
[17:17] the Lord so they said he's born in
[17:21] Sydney
[17:21] how can he how can he be a man of God
[17:26] because he was a virgin he was virgin
[17:29] born that's what we understand but
[17:31] they're saying no he wasn't virgin
[17:33] warned some said he was that Mary had
[17:37] gotten with some Roman soldier or
[17:39] something like that so you start to see
[17:41] that the testimony of what they're
[17:44] talking about God about our Lord they're
[17:48] they're giving out a bad testimony of
[17:51] our Lord and you start to look at who
[17:54] does man say to them
[17:55] they said he's blz Bob by the Prince of
[17:58] Devils he can cast out devil so you say
[18:02] well they're calling our Lord these
[18:04] things and you say well ah the opinions
[18:07] of man if we're going to stand by the
[18:09] opinion of man he's leading the people
[18:13] astray he's taking him away from the map
[18:15] though the message of the hour he's
[18:17] taking him away from the law of the
[18:19] prophets he's taking him away from the
[18:21] priesthood he's taking him away from
[18:23] temple worship he's taking him away from
[18:25] all these things they said that about
[18:30] Jesus our Lord but what did the faithful
[18:34] say the faithful the faithful man said
[18:37] one day he says he opened my eyes and I
[18:40] was born I was born blind he says nobody
[18:44] can open a man Matthew 2923 it says but
[18:49] if if this man were not of God he could
[18:53] do nothing so the blind man was was
[18:58] standing there with his eyes open saying
[19:00] this miracle can be nothing but the hand
[19:03] of God and you don't know where he comes
[19:07] from you guys thinking you know you
[19:10] can't figure out where he comes from and
[19:17] they said you're born of sin you come to
[19:19] teach us and they cast him out of the
[19:21] temple Isaiah said he's Emmanuel and by
[19:27] interpretation in Matthew 129 it says
[19:30] that means God with us believers saw him
[19:37] for what he really was Peter said right
[19:40] in that same scripture reading thou art
[19:42] the Christ the Son of the Living God now
[19:49] becomes another question talking about
[19:52] the messages our hoo doos does men say
[19:58] William Branham is you know according to
[20:03] 2 Matthew 24:24 they say he's one of the
[20:07] false prophets
[20:09] because he you know the scripture tells
[20:11] us Jesus was giving a warning that at
[20:13] the end time there will be false
[20:15] prophets amongst us so they come back
[20:18] and say he's an antichrist or one of the
[20:21] false prophets that's to come into the
[20:23] world at the end time that's what they
[20:26] say about this message or this William
[20:28] Branham that came unto this endtime
[20:31] people they tell him all he's he's a
[20:36] powerful medium he's a mind reader
[20:39] he's a soothsayer they gave all kinds of
[20:43] descriptions to try and say that this
[20:46] power of God that was moving amongst the
[20:50] people they were giving all kinds of
[20:52] excuses to print it towards the demonic
[20:55] side but yet you see some people that
[21:02] saw something in that manner TL Osborn
[21:07] says I saw Jesus with us once again in
[21:12] the ministry of William Branham who
[21:17] really is William Branham the Bible the
[21:22] the Bible should be able to identify him
[21:26] and we can see him according to Malachi
[21:30] four and five that he's the one that
[21:33] will bring back the hearts of the
[21:36] children back to the Father he's
[21:39] bringing us back to the book of Acts and
[21:42] we're seeing that in our day and age the
[21:44] book of Acts
[21:45] once again portrayed amongst us and as
[21:48] we look at the ministry of William
[21:50] Branham we can see in Amos 3:7 that your
[21:55] Lord your God will do nothing least he
[21:58] revealed himself to his servants the
[22:00] prophets
[22:01] Cisse jesus said who do you say that I
[22:04] am and if William branham's would have
[22:07] said who do you say that I am where do I
[22:10] identify in the scriptures where is my
[22:13] place
[22:14] in this gospel right and over and over
[22:18] again through the different messages
[22:20] that we listen to we see him
[22:22] identifying himself is the word of God
[22:25] for this hour we see the the places
[22:28] where we see it now we start to look at
[22:31] the scriptures and we see that there's
[22:33] mysteries that have been hidden through
[22:35] the ages in the Book of Daniel Daniel 12
[22:39] 14 it says that that let's go over there
[22:44] Daniel 12 and for Daniel 12 and for
[22:49] there's no okay Daniel 12 and 4 it says
[22:54] but Thou O Daniel shut up the words it's
[22:57] in seal the book even until the time of
[23:01] the end many shall run to and fro and
[23:04] knowledge shall increase see there's
[23:07] things that have been hidden through the
[23:09] ages that have been hidden holy script
[23:12] you know I reminds me of my mom you know
[23:16] I loved cherries we went and pick some
[23:20] bean cherries one time we don't grow
[23:22] being carries in from cially we grow the
[23:24] little pie cherries little things like
[23:25] that and the Robins get him most of the
[23:27] time so we never get very much of them
[23:29] but in their sour but we went down down
[23:33] to lower lands and found some bean
[23:35] cherries and we picked them and my mom
[23:37] doesn't pick just a little bit she
[23:39] picked tubs of them and and she can them
[23:42] all and she sealed those cans inside a
[23:46] pressure cooker those bottles inside a
[23:48] pressure cooker and every so often I
[23:52] would sneak into the pantry grab a
[23:55] bottle and grab a spoon from the from
[23:57] the the silverware and take off out to
[24:01] the barn and I'd eat all those cherries
[24:04] of that bought jar and all of a sudden I
[24:07] and I'd hide the jar back there and
[24:08] behind the chicken coop out there and
[24:11] all of a sudden mom comes out there and
[24:13] she is she was cleaning up back there
[24:14] and she finds that bottle and that spoon
[24:16] stuck in there and all the little pits
[24:18] and she says who got this you know who
[24:25] got this Daniel did you bring that out
[24:27] here cuz yeah Jesus
[24:31] why did you do that just I really like
[24:35] those cherries
[24:36] um and she says well she says I don't
[24:40] mind you eating the cherries take them
[24:43] inside the house put them in a bowl
[24:45] don't leave my jars out here and bring
[24:52] the spoon back so there's things in this
[24:58] word that have been sealed up for us in
[25:01] this day and age I didn't need to die in
[25:05] some of the Terry's when they were fresh
[25:07] but they were so good even when they
[25:10] were sealed up for a long long time
[25:13] and you know what the Word of God has
[25:16] sealed up power for you for this date
[25:20] and for this age the Word of God has
[25:23] brought things to pass he's he's
[25:27] preserved his word so that you can have
[25:31] a fresh taste of this manna the hidden
[25:35] manna that was preserved for you for
[25:38] this day for this ministry to give to
[25:40] you a faith that was once delivered to
[25:44] the Saints
[25:45] hallelujah so we stand here
[25:49] beneficiaries of the Word of God for our
[25:52] hour has been brought to pass so that we
[25:56] can so we can stand here and by faith
[25:58] look upon the Word of God and say this
[26:01] is for me I don't doubt that this word
[26:05] of God has produced the healing virtue
[26:08] that I have need of it produces the
[26:11] resurrection that I have need of it
[26:14] produces the power of God that I have
[26:17] need of for this day an hour that's why
[26:19] I can look at every promise in the Word
[26:21] of God and say this is my possession
[26:25] why because mama seal those cherries up
[26:29] for me
[26:31] you know heed father God seal this this
[26:36] word of God up for you for this day and
[26:38] age and we look at the Word of God and
[26:41] we start to see the different places
[26:43] that God has has brought the Word of God
[26:47] and shed sealed it up for the end time
[26:51] and now he's decided to open it up so it
[26:56] can be revealed to his bride to give his
[26:59] bride a rapturing faith he cares for us
[27:03] he knows your name he knows who you are
[27:06] he knows what you're going through
[27:08] hallelujah so we realize that as we look
[27:12] at the revelation of the seven seals
[27:15] revelations 501 it says that it was
[27:18] given for our day and age oh I hate to
[27:23] use this costing for blowing my nose
[27:28] excuse me recognize that this word of
[27:34] God has been sealed up through the ages
[27:36] and it's sealed up so that you and me a
[27:40] little kid running up through the the
[27:43] woods up there in osceola would come to
[27:46] a day that this would be a revelation to
[27:49] me that this would be a truth that can
[27:53] be revealed in my heart and then it can
[27:57] be manifested manifested in a people
[28:02] that will take him at his word
[28:04] hallelujah and we've come to a place
[28:09] when we start to look you know the
[28:13] question now comes up we know that Jesus
[28:17] when they said who do you say that I am
[28:20] whom do men say that I am we could have
[28:24] ain't going to give him a long list of
[28:26] things then when G when the believer
[28:28] said who do they say that he is they
[28:31] recognize them for who he was the
[28:34] devil's recognized him too but we start
[28:37] to look at who brother Branham was for
[28:40] his day and age although they called him
[28:43] all those
[28:44] things we the believers have come to a
[28:47] place where we recognize never a man
[28:50] spoke like this man
[28:52] it was Jesus's anointing upon that man
[28:55] that caused us to come to this faith
[28:58] that we now know and now looking at this
[29:01] truth that we're standing on we start to
[29:05] look in one more question the question
[29:09] comes up now when I stand here and say
[29:12] now who do you say that you are I stand
[29:20] here and I say who do you say that I am
[29:25] you say well your brother Daniel you
[29:28] your your your your minister it comes
[29:30] out of brother Manuel's Church out there
[29:32] in New Mexico and that's not that's true
[29:38] in a way they're very superficial but in
[29:44] truth when you start to look at who you
[29:47] are in the scripture who you are in the
[29:50] word you start to look at for the bride
[29:53] has made herself ready you start to look
[29:56] at the signs of the time that we're
[29:58] living in you start to look at the at
[30:00] that that Google car driving out there
[30:03] in the streets of California already of
[30:06] post completely by remote control and
[30:08] you start to see the Word of God is
[30:11] coming to pass brother man would sit
[30:14] there and look at Israel returning to
[30:16] their homeland and it would bring
[30:18] something up in him but a man would see
[30:21] Hitler's fall or Hitler's rise and then
[30:24] inners fall and it would bring something
[30:26] up inside him right why because it was
[30:30] not set the Lord that had come already
[30:32] now you're coming to a place where
[30:35] you're sitting here and you're starting
[30:36] to see that that does set the Lord every
[30:39] item is coming to pass science is
[30:42] advancing we stand in the in the in the
[30:45] day of a nuclear war we stand in a day
[30:47] when when the unite uniting of churches
[30:50] is is being pressured they've been
[30:54] telling brother Manuel
[30:55] he's getting letters and stuff telling
[30:57] him
[30:58] are telling them you should come to
[31:00] these meetings you're a minister you
[31:03] should be coming to these meetings these
[31:06] meetings are to unite the Brethren
[31:08] everybody has to unite you have to be
[31:11] part of this of this big what do they
[31:15] call it organization and of course who's
[31:19] going to be the head of it you know you
[31:21] know that the biggest organization is
[31:23] going to be the head of it
[31:24] Catholicism but there's a big pull to be
[31:27] uniting time there's a uniting time and
[31:30] it's of the denominations though the
[31:33] scripture talks about the parable it
[31:35] says the weeds are gathered first and
[31:38] then the weeks gathered the weeds are
[31:43] gathered to be burned and they're
[31:46] gathering strong there's a strong
[31:49] gathering pull together and that's
[31:54] listening to Trump on one of the
[31:56] speeches and he's talking so much about
[31:59] Catholicism how good Catholicism has
[32:02] been and all this and then I listen to
[32:04] brother Branham saying you know there'll
[32:07] be some Ricky like person that a woman's
[32:10] man they'll just sell out you know sell
[32:13] this whole thing out you know I thought
[32:15] wow could this be Trump I said my gosh I
[32:18] just you don't realize that you know
[32:21] that that the Word of God is going to
[32:24] come to pass you know when it is you
[32:30] know when my Kyah gay when elijah gave
[32:36] the prophecy about about a hab my Chaya
[32:41] came back and said that the angel oh
[32:44] Lord I mean that the that the Lord was
[32:47] asking who will bring this thing the
[32:51] Word of God to pass in an evil spirit
[32:54] came up to make it happen you start to
[32:57] look at it you start to look at all
[32:59] things all things work for the good for
[33:04] those that don't love Lord you know we
[33:06] have Joseph was showing me a
[33:10] and you know I work in a nuclear
[33:12] facility I work on the atomic bombs I
[33:15] know what's there and Joseph was showing
[33:20] me a film of the power of the atomic
[33:24] weapons being developed and I knew that
[33:28] they were way strong but you know to see
[33:31] them in comparisons the mushroom cloud
[33:34] in comparison Isis my gosh I says we one
[33:39] of these new new weapons that they have
[33:41] out there could crack this world right
[33:43] in half and send the pieces out to space
[33:47] I mean there'll be nothing left and this
[33:52] is in the end there and they're over
[33:53] there sabre-rattling out there and in uh
[33:56] in what is it uh South Korea and and and
[34:02] we're saying oh you dare try and do
[34:04] anything we'll bought nuke you you know
[34:07] we're not holding back this guy doesn't
[34:10] know what power is yielding right we
[34:13] know that he can't do anything until the
[34:15] Lord says it's time so we're we're
[34:17] standing here looking at the the day but
[34:22] you know what what we say what who do
[34:24] you say you are who do you say you are
[34:28] who do you undergo what does man say you
[34:30] are that doesn't matter what does the
[34:33] word say you are if you start to look at
[34:37] I'm the bride of the Living God
[34:39] I'm the Bride of Christ and I live for
[34:42] this word of god that he's given me in
[34:44] my day an hour that will bring me to a
[34:46] rapturing faith and the knowledge of who
[34:50] he is
[34:51] you know we're standing in the day of
[34:53] the Jubilee R we're already I mean if
[34:57] you look at 50 years were a past time of
[34:59] the Jubilee year but we as believers
[35:02] should be coming to a place where we're
[35:04] we we've got the Holy Ghost and that
[35:07] Holy Ghost
[35:08] inside of us is producing something it's
[35:12] producing a faith the kind of faith that
[35:16] was once delivered to the Saints the
[35:18] kind of faith that you'll stand there
[35:20] and say well silver and gold I don't
[35:22] ever what I do have I'll give to you in
[35:24] the name of Jesus Christ rise up to your
[35:26] feet we've got that power because it was
[35:29] given to us by the Word of God by
[35:32] Pentecost everything that was in
[35:34] Pentecost is amongst us today as
[35:37] believers as we hold as believers with
[35:41] some monsters today and we have a right
[35:43] to it don't don't don't you know what a
[35:47] pardon is not a pardon unless it's taken
[35:50] as a part of it and your faith has to be
[35:53] stand in the forefront so you say I
[35:56] believe that everybody here that has
[36:00] need of healing will be healed
[36:02] because it's God gave it to me in his
[36:06] word and I have faith in his word so
[36:10] I'll take this pardon I'll take what he
[36:13] did at Calvary
[36:14] he said by His stripes I am healed and
[36:18] I'll stand here and I'll say I'll
[36:19] testify of the truth that God's given to
[36:22] us in this day and age amen so we stand
[36:27] here you know when brother Branham said
[36:29] you know if you reject the seal of God
[36:33] you're taking on the mark of the beast
[36:37] we've got to be a people that know that
[36:40] we've got the Holy Ghost know beyond any
[36:44] shadow of doubt that the Spirit of the
[36:46] Living God lives within you lives within
[36:50] your heart stands at the forefront will
[36:54] compel your words to come out of your
[36:56] mouth even if you don't realize what
[36:59] you're saying you'll say the truth
[37:01] you'll say his word you'll confess his
[37:04] word you'll believe his word hallelujah
[37:07] so what happens so we stand here as a
[37:11] bride of Christ and we start to look at
[37:13] the places we fit into scripture for the
[37:17] Bible says the bride has made herself
[37:19] ready revelations 21 I mean really come
[37:25] and see the bride it says revelations 21
[37:28] 9 and you start to look back and it says
[37:31] for revelation 21:3 let's go back there
[37:35] and see it
[37:36] real quick we start to see scriptures
[37:38] that talk about well the bride has made
[37:40] herself ready you start to see the
[37:43] scriptures that that are fulfilled in
[37:45] His Word and revelations 21 3 it says
[37:49] then behold I heard a book and and I
[37:54] heard the great voice out of heaven
[37:56] saying behold the temp the the
[38:02] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[38:05] will dwell with them and they shall be
[38:09] his people and God himself shall be with
[38:14] them and and be their God and then comes
[38:20] skip over to a 21-9 it says and and it
[38:26] says and there came unto me one of the
[38:30] seven angels which had the seven vials
[38:33] full of the seven last plagues and
[38:37] talked with me saying come hither I will
[38:42] show thee the bride the Lambs wife do

[38:59] identified in the word that's my part I
[39:03] am the Lambs bride I am the Lambs wife
[39:06] and it's his spirit that has come down
[39:09] to dwell in me to produce what this
[39:12] message is calling for in the last days

[39:18] that a rapturing page what's that just
[39:20] believing is word for your healing
[39:23] believing is word for everything that

[49:26] a man named and they make sure you tell
[49:30] her brother how much we appreciate the
[49:31] message because we believe it the bride
[49:36] of Jesus Christ around the world the
[49:40] prophet has said it and we believe it
[49:42] when she recognizes who she is
[49:45] once she's here far in it she's his wife
[49:52] Caesars Brock
[49:55] why wouldn't he listen you realize that
[50:02] God will hear you quicker in here we'll
[50:04] hear an angel well because you're his
[50:08] child you think he's not going to listen
[50:11] to his children hears the cries he knows
[50:15] what's going on don't ever think that
[50:17] God's not listening he knows all about
[50:20] you but you know what he's doing
[50:23] sometimes is waiting on and see what we
[50:25] come to I think he's waiting for the
[50:29] bride to step out upon the word and
[50:32] confess who she is and believe it is
[50:37] that a hard time to think about we're
[50:41] the ones at the end of the world has
[50:43] come upon and and you've had all of
[50:45] those great ones back down through time
[50:47] before us into things we're going to go
[50:51] out of here just by haphazardly floating
[50:54] along you know I don't want my children
[50:58] act like that I wanted to believe and
[51:02] move on and go don't try what about he
[51:05] is telling brother how much you
[51:06] appreciate it with just remember now
[51:07] that tells you meeting for the pageant
[51:10] Saturday and just remember that and then
[51:12] remember brother Villanueva will be with
[51:14] us the Lord willing sunday ministering
[51:17] for just the Lord would bless him and
[51:20] give him you know whatever we have need
[51:22] up because that's what we desire you
[51:25] know what I've always said you want to
[51:27] hear something from God what the
[51:28] prophets say except you want to hear
[51:31] something from God he says God's
[51:33] obligated said here put somebody on the
[51:35] platform
[51:37] to tell you but now well though I
[51:41] believe if it was up now he didn't say
[51:44] that did he
[51:45] he took a dumb donkey one time and
[51:51] rebuked a prophet now what if the
[51:55] Prophet had it went right on the way he
[51:57] was going he's been dead that's the best
[52:01] way to say so maybe were to listen to
[52:04] them voices sometimes instead of
[52:06] rejecting father we thank you for
[52:09] tonight and we pray that you just bless
[52:11] each and every one of us more than that
[52:13] we would come to realization of who you
[52:15] we are and what we're here for this is
[52:18] the hour that everything is coming to a
[52:19] close Lord we can look at all of the
[52:22] natural and see things and we're not
[52:24] worried about that because we're looking
[52:26] at you and you just have your way with
