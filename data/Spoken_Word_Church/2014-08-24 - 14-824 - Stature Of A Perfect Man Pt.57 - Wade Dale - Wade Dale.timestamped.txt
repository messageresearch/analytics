[0:00] got it all right
[0:02] oh that's ugly anyway okay
[0:06] I want to uh
[0:10] answer a question that um
[0:13] just a freed a half of the last week we
[0:16] kind of got on circumcision and things
[0:19] like that and
[0:20] I'm gonna let brother Branham answer it
[0:23] because I got a quote pulled up here
[0:27] and you don't mind me reading the
[0:29] question okay they're good questions
[0:31] there's the fact that Abram Abraham had
[0:34] children by three different women have a
[0:35] spiritual meaning type Etc
[0:38] yes because Abram had one child Abraham
[0:42] had a promise Son by Sarah and then he
[0:45] had children by another woman that means
[0:47] that the all all nations can come in and
[0:50] be covered under the Covenant
[0:53] ishmael's kids are covered under a
[0:55] covenant we preached that yeah okay they
[0:58] have a covenant they have a promise
[1:00] they have a way to get back I mean you
[1:03] know their Wild Child they're over there
[1:04] fighting but you know what God give them
[1:06] a problem
[1:07] okay because they come through Abram
[1:09] under a permissive promise everything
[1:12] with Abram was permissive everything
[1:14] with Abraham after the change was the
[1:16] perfect will of God because that was the
[1:18] promised child Isaac there was only one
[1:21] child promised to Abram Abraham any of
[1:23] them that was one that was Isaac okay
[1:25] and through Isaac was comes all this at
[1:28] work that we're we're talking about
[1:30] hearing Psalms and all that so so it's
[1:33] very important and then the ones he had
[1:34] later means that all the rest of them
[1:35] can come in
[1:36] it didn't work last week and I don't see
[1:38] it working this week either
[1:41] we don't have Bob here we got a brother
[1:44] Louise with us maybe he can take care of
[1:46] all this junk
[1:48] I have no audio huh no
[1:53] you don't know anything about that yet
[1:54] you're welcome
[1:58] I just don't want to touch it yet I will
[2:01] it's recording and it's recording up
[2:04] here so let's not worry about that all
[2:05] right let's get started because I want
[2:07] to read this this Frida acid what the
[2:10] circumcision
[2:11] what's the spiritual type of
[2:13] circumvision now all of you know
[2:15] what that is is that correct we're all
[2:17] adults and here we know that the males
[2:19] born with excess foreskin on his private
[2:22] parts and it's just there and God gave
[2:26] Israel a promise I mean Abraham I
[2:29] promise
[2:30] hang on a minute I'm fine whoa
[2:37] here in just a second
[2:44] there we go
[2:49] here's your tie the Holy Ghost is
[2:51] circumcision what circumcision do cuts
[2:54] off Surplus flesh all the things of the
[2:57] world it circumcises you away from the
[2:59] things of the world the love of the
[3:00] world the love of the flesh the pride of
[3:03] life it just circumcises you from that
[3:06] you have nothing to do with it it does
[3:07] it itself now this is the spiritual
[3:09] application okay
[3:11] back in the Old Testament under the
[3:13] bulls and goats what we were just
[3:15] talking about the law the law couldn't
[3:17] do away with sin
[3:19] all right so it covered sin so sin was
[3:22] still there but a man like Abraham and
[3:25] Isaac and all those coming down through
[3:27] there could prove that they were under
[3:30] the Covenant circumcision by showing it
[3:33] remember I told you last night you could
[3:36] physically go around you know the priest
[3:38] could go in the back corner and you
[3:40] could say look I'm a Jew okay so you're
[3:42] coming under the Covenant and you know
[3:44] that was so strong until it came down to
[3:46] the New Testament even after Jesus left
[3:49] even after the Holy Ghost came
[3:51] Peter and and Paul some of them brought
[3:54] Timothy or one of them into the temple
[3:57] and he wasn't circumcised because he was
[3:58] a gentile most Gentiles were circumcised
[4:00] because they didn't know anything about
[4:02] it they were just
[4:04] fleshly worldly people okay same way
[4:07] with here if you're uncircumcised now
[4:08] but now remember Paul said it's not
[4:10] circumcision or uncircumcision now of
[4:12] the flesh right but it's a circumcision
[4:15] of the heart which what works its way
[4:17] out into the flesh
[4:19] takes that excess flesh away it takes
[4:22] quite in other words
[4:24] this is kind of funny if you'll think
[4:26] about it but
[4:27] Abraham was 99 years old
[4:31] he circumcised himself
[4:33] he walks different
[4:36] you understand what I'm talking about
[4:39] the same way with Joshua when Joshua
[4:41] went over into the promised land before
[4:43] he went into the promised land he said
[4:45] wait a minute he said we've got all
[4:47] these kids under 20 years old that's
[4:49] never been circumcised so he took all
[4:51] them kids 20 years old males circumcised
[4:54] every one of them and the Bible said
[4:56] three days
[4:58] they stayed in their tent
[5:00] you understand what I'm saying well you
[5:02] women probably don't but you men know
[5:03] what I'm talking about it'd be a real
[5:05] hard to circumcise somebody especially
[5:06] yourself at 99 years old but it makes
[5:09] you walk different so there's the whole
[5:11] God had to bring something natural
[5:15] okay because they spoke natural and
[5:17] carnal in the in the Old Testament do's
[5:20] and don'ts you do this don't do this
[5:21] don't do this don't do that all right
[5:23] they spoke carnal so God had to speak
[5:25] carnal to them give them an outside
[5:28] showing
[5:30] right give them an outside showing but
[5:33] now once it come by the new birth now
[5:36] it's an inside showing but it doesn't do
[5:38] away with circumcision it just makes it
[5:40] a spiritual application coming back out
[5:42] and then it takes the excess of this guy
[5:45] your whole flesh
[5:47] and does away with the old part or the
[5:50] excess flesh that really does no good
[5:53] there's no good to that excess piece of
[5:55] Flesh it's just thrown away all right so
[5:57] same thing with here that accent when
[5:59] God circumcises your heart
[6:01] causes out the old stuff
[6:04] and you're a new creature you walk
[6:06] different
[6:07] okay
[6:08] your walk is definitely different so I
[6:10] just wanted to let brother around them
[6:12] uh there's there's a bunch down through
[6:14] here
[6:15] um you'll look over there to the side
[6:17] of the steel circumcision and all that
[6:19] but uh basically I love this uh where
[6:22] you can just sit and put the word in and
[6:23] man it just pops up and you got all
[6:25] these 175 quotes about circumcision
[6:31] is it just for the tablet
[6:34] for a laptop
[6:36] for phones also yeah I've got it on my
[6:39] phone it's free iPhone or but it is for
[6:41] your tablet but you can put it on your
[6:42] computer pick right yeah but it's a
[6:44] different but it's different it's the
[6:46] message
[6:48] okay but this one is just for a tablet
[6:50] or your or your phone and it's wonderful
[6:53] and it's it's quick really quick because
[6:56] I mean I pulled up 175 quotes just like
[6:58] that that's right I mean it's real fast
[7:00] used to 20 years ago if you'd have put
[7:03] in circumcision you could have went and
[7:05] got coffee and had a circumcision and
[7:07] come back and it still would have they
[7:09] still would have would have not been
[7:11] done Daddy put in a quote one time and
[7:14] it was like 3 000 3 000 Times Really
[7:17] around said it took a half a day for
[7:19] that thing to load up
[7:20] all the clothes he went and done
[7:23] something went out and worked and did
[7:24] something to come back and it was still
[7:25] loading up but but now man you just
[7:27] punch that button it's on there so yes
[7:31] in the Old Testament they didn't have
[7:33] the new birth to understand spirit
[7:34] that's correct it had to be natural
[7:37] everything in the Old Testament had to
[7:39] be a natural application because they
[7:41] sure there were prophets they were
[7:43] Isaiah and all the ones that could
[7:44] understand spiritual things but that was
[7:46] one Prophet to a nation of millions of
[7:49] people that was one profit even Kings
[7:52] had a problem a lot of times look at
[7:54] David like like brother Danny was
[7:56] preaching another name David had
[7:57] problems
[7:59] as a king and as a human being but
[8:01] without the new birth that's what you're
[8:02] always going to lean toward the flesh
[8:04] without a new birth you know that as
[8:05] well as I do
[8:07] hello we all lean to the flesh first
[8:10] right before the new birth right because
[8:13] that's why we were born in sand shaping
[8:15] in an equity and we needed to be born
[8:17] again what the old flesh cut off
[8:21] and then we have a new Walk On Christ so
[8:24] that was one of the that was the couple
[8:26] of questions and then now let's go to
[8:28] the uh
[8:30] I want to get to the
[8:32] sister Shepherd's dream LeBron Louise
[8:35] and Sister Christine we've been on the
[8:36] Statue of perfect man this is meal
[8:38] number 57
[8:40] so we've been doing this since last
[8:42] Christmas I think and uh
[8:44] we really are we're getting to a point
[8:47] to where now
[8:49] I think it's going to take the Holy
[8:51] Ghost to do it to do this for us
[8:53] because
[8:56] the dream
[8:57] sister Shepard had a dream now brother
[9:00] Brown didn't cover this dream in the
[9:01] Statue of a perfect man why I don't
[9:03] think he put them together all right at
[9:06] first
[9:06] but once he preached the statue of a
[9:08] perfect man and then he goes and
[9:10] preaches Blasphemous names a week later
[9:13] he looks back on that dream and God
[9:15] brings it to his memory because I think
[9:17] she had the dream before he preached at
[9:18] the perfect man but remember nobody had
[9:21] ever taught this like this before now
[9:22] Peter said at dear Faith virtue
[9:25] knowledge tempered patience sure he was
[9:27] and the virtues but now as far as
[9:29] putting this together and sealing it
[9:31] with the Holy Ghost and and because
[9:33] remember the headstone hadn't come sure
[9:36] he was Jesus Christ but when he left he
[9:37] took that with him right right okay he
[9:40] was The Headstone sure he sent back a
[9:43] little bit on the day of Pentecost he
[9:45] sent back what the Cornerstone
[9:47] okay the bottom part the corner we were
[9:50] talking about that the other day you
[9:52] know if you make a little wine right
[9:53] here there's your Cornerstone it's the
[9:55] same thing as this
[9:56] and this is a little pyramid in itself
[10:00] yep so that's right you know and we may
[10:02] get into this after we finish this
[10:04] uh I preached a sermon on it several
[10:06] years ago but you got justification
[10:09] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[10:10] Ghost and that doesn't stop there right
[10:12] you still have to add The Virtue right
[10:14] so you start with justification
[10:15] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[10:17] Spirit
[10:18] second stage coming in then right here
[10:21] when the Capstone comes it's a higher
[10:23] form of justification sanctification
[10:25] about 10 months ago you can't get past
[10:27] those three things every step you make
[10:29] because remember this part of
[10:31] justification down here yeah you did it
[10:33] that's right you did it that's right and
[10:37] you know you did it yeah you're right
[10:39] nobody's got to tell you you did it you
[10:41] know you did it because you did it okay
[10:43] but now you come on up here a little bit
[10:45] further you see that true justification
[10:46] is the real you didn't do okay okay the
[10:50] one that came from God that Holy Ghost
[10:52] that that logos that came down and
[10:54] became a part of your life it never
[10:56] sinned a day in its life but you've got
[10:58] to realize all up through here
[11:02] that comes right there the real you've
[11:05] never done it to start with and you
[11:07] gotta see that and you'll know that the
[11:09] real you all that all those things are
[11:12] um Paul says the former things have
[11:13] passed away or John did former things
[11:15] that passed away all things have become
[11:17] what new all right okay
[11:20] that is when this comes
[11:22] he said well we're down here yeah it's
[11:24] going to happen here for the people
[11:25] think of body change it's going to
[11:27] happen right here we're not going to get
[11:28] anybody change in the in the future home
[11:30] no we're gonna get our body change right
[11:33] here even the ones that die right are
[11:35] going to resurrect get a new body same
[11:37] body redeem yeah get there and you've
[11:40] got to have it to get there because this
[11:41] remember Flesh and Blood the Bible says
[11:43] flesh and blood will not inherit the
[11:45] Kingdom of Heaven what the flesh and
[11:47] blood that Samuel and Peggy Dale gave me
[11:49] will not make it there right that's why
[11:52] they call it a change you have to be
[11:53] changed right your atoms have to be
[11:56] changed your whole being has to be
[11:58] changed and you know what then you can
[12:00] say I've been circumcised
[12:04] you can say yeah I've been circumcised
[12:06] and come into the body of Christ by the
[12:07] Holy Ghost
[12:08] and right here remember in this dream
[12:11] sister Shepard saw trash coming out of
[12:13] the box
[12:14] so you still got trash in here right
[12:17] amen amen God's still working on me amen
[12:22] I Die daily Paul said well that's what
[12:24] Paul was saying I died of my knowledge
[12:27] every day I've died in my Temperance
[12:30] every day I've died on my patience
[12:32] because these are not my
[12:34] my virtues
[12:35] they're his virtue amen that when
[12:38] they're applied to me they become mine
[12:41] that's right I love that quote where
[12:42] brother Brown says this is my eye God
[12:44] gave it to me well see it was God's he'd
[12:46] give it to him but once you give it to
[12:48] somebody and then your brother around
[12:49] saying God's not an Indian giver well
[12:51] he's not doing that just to fill up tape
[12:52] space he's telling you that when God
[12:54] gives you something this is my eye God
[12:55] give it to him so it's mine
[12:57] so so God gives right for eternity
[13:01] so the New Birth when it comes to many
[13:03] Insurance God's New Birth but it's mine
[13:05] when I get it because remember brother
[13:07] Brown said it's you and him do they're
[13:08] in there as person vulcanized when he
[13:11] says vulcanize that when you vulcanize
[13:13] something you can't see the scene you
[13:14] can't see
[13:16] where he was and where you were see
[13:18] that's up here
[13:19] that's really showing that God's in here
[13:22] because remember that's what we're going
[13:24] to talk about we ever get to it
[13:26] this Holy Spirit the brother Bible said
[13:30] it molds and seals all this in
[13:34] because we still got cracks right we got
[13:38] cracks in our patients godliness
[13:39] Brothers
[13:41] but now when we have the true brotherly
[13:44] kindness like brother Brown had
[13:48] he'll seal it in
[13:50] brother Brown you know they always said
[13:51] that you couldn't tell who his enemies
[13:53] or his friends were whenever you know
[13:54] what you stay around me long enough
[13:56] you're gonna know who I like and who I
[13:58] don't like
[14:00] same way with you
[14:05] all of you
[14:08] so more than others so see some are
[14:10] growing more than others
[14:15] God will tell you where you're at
[14:17] he'll send somebody by just a show he'll
[14:19] send he'll cut you off in traffic just
[14:21] see hey temperatures he will do it
[14:24] brother Brown said God will put somebody
[14:26] in your way and say something out of the
[14:30] way to see how you'll react that's right
[14:32] now God knows how you're going to react
[14:34] but you don't know how you're going to
[14:36] react but once you do like that when
[14:38] when Daddy when that guy slap that down
[14:40] at General Motors well he knew then when
[14:42] he come to that place he knew then that
[14:44] his Temperance had come to a place where
[14:45] it wasn't before well see then you can
[14:47] glory in that and know that you've got
[14:49] you're at least going up that's right
[14:51] right you know he's going to try your
[14:53] Temperance and patience we've already
[14:55] been through these two things these two
[14:57] go together and they're hard
[15:00] okay they're real hard to get through
[15:03] but you know what the 120 in the upper
[15:07] room got through it
[15:10] women and men
[15:13] so we can get through it we've got more
[15:15] word than they've got
[15:17] we got more words than they have in in
[15:19] the new in the end of 120 Upper Room
[15:22] it's all right we did yes
[15:26] but right here is what our goal is our
[15:28] goal is here but let's finish let's read
[15:30] a little bit more
[15:36] all right let's read paragraph 128. I
[15:39] changed the fonts can you see those a
[15:40] little bit better so I can say bye okay
[15:43] can you see a little bit better I
[15:44] changed the fonts a little bit more so
[15:45] you can
[15:46] a little more plain running around after
[15:48] I'm an old man now he's talking about
[15:49] brotherly kindness because look without
[15:51] this thing right here here is our key
[15:56] because if we don't have this sealed in
[15:58] this is not going to come like it should
[16:00] now remember you get the Holy Ghost down
[16:02] here you get the new birth you're part
[16:04] of the Kingdom you're part of the body
[16:05] of Christ your son and daughter of God
[16:06] but you're a spirit baby that's right
[16:10] you're a baby down here
[16:13] a babbling crying father father that's
[16:16] what the Bible says you give the spirit
[16:18] of adoption whereby you cry and by
[16:21] father when I look you don't cry up here
[16:25] no ain't no crying up here this is the
[16:28] mature person this is somebody who knows
[16:29] how to handle the word of God because
[16:31] remember you get power down here
[16:34] power with characters fit to rule power
[16:36] without character satanic so you can't
[16:38] come to this place
[16:41] okay
[16:42] that's right man power with character
[16:44] right leave your character builder it's
[16:48] fit to rule power without character it's
[16:50] Italian now that doesn't mean you're
[16:52] you've got Satan in your soul
[16:54] but you it means that you there's some
[16:55] things you can't get rid of that's right
[16:59] and you got to get rid of these
[17:03] which part you want me to say you said
[17:07] power without character okay it's a town
[17:09] that means that you've got part of you
[17:12] don't have Satan in your soul but Satan
[17:14] can get into that realm of memory reason
[17:16] conscious about Hey listen people he
[17:18] plays in that really listen to me memory
[17:22] reason conscious affection imagination
[17:25] now that's the Devil's Playground
[17:27] see tastes Phil smelling here ain't got
[17:30] nothing to do with the Devil
[17:32] that's just to contact this world is
[17:34] what the prophet says that's why Adam
[17:36] was put in a flesh body in five senses
[17:38] to see tasteful smelling here now
[17:40] through that filter coming down to
[17:42] memory reason conscious facts and
[17:44] Imagination
[17:45] that's where Satan can get to it but he
[17:48] can't get in that center around that
[17:49] Center realm is what our is Faith or
[17:52] doubt that's right or fear or faith
[17:56] that's in the Cinderella there's only
[17:58] two characteristics in that Center room
[18:00] fear or faith now not like the fear like
[18:04] Ryan had Ryan had fear because of and I
[18:06] told him I said look I said the doctor's
[18:08] doing what they can do because this is
[18:10] flesh the doctors can work on this flesh
[18:13] that's what they're put here for okay
[18:16] but they can't do anything with your
[18:17] spirit console that has to come from God
[18:19] it has to be it has to be influenced by
[18:22] you when you walk into that room and you
[18:23] have fear the first thing that baby is
[18:25] going to feel is they're going to feel
[18:26] that fear first thing a person is going
[18:29] to feel when you walk in that room
[18:30] you're going to feel fear if there's
[18:32] fear there and there was okay but when
[18:36] you take that and say just don't fear
[18:39] walking you know you know what
[18:41] you have to be like Abraham
[18:44] Abraham didn't have a baby for 25 years
[18:47] right think of it people
[18:50] some of y'all have been alive 25 years
[18:54] or being brain dead for a few before
[18:56] that now you're kind of a little bit
[18:57] alive but okay
[19:00] really I mean your brain did do you
[19:02] about 30 anyway
[19:04] amen amen everybody's gonna agree with
[19:07] that because I was
[19:10] even born again you do things as as a
[19:14] young adult that you really wouldn't do
[19:16] when you're older okay
[19:22] oh fear
[19:24] the baby or any situation you have and
[19:28] and I don't want people to think that
[19:30] I'm I'm arrogant but but when you have
[19:32] when you just have so much faith and you
[19:35] just don't let something bother you
[19:36] Abraham had so much faith that things
[19:39] didn't bother him that's true because
[19:41] remember 25 years down the road he knew
[19:45] he couldn't perform you understand what
[19:47] I'm saying naturally
[19:48] so he got to a point and said Okay God
[19:51] you're gonna have to do it that's
[19:53] exactly because I can't do it anymore
[19:55] because remember he tried with Ishmael
[19:58] he could produce
[20:00] remember Abram could produce a child all
[20:03] right but when he got to Abraham it had
[20:06] to be God
[20:07] to change that man back so that's the
[20:09] same way with you and I because every
[20:11] certain other faith is going to go to
[20:12] this final Journey which in the end
[20:14] you're going to have to just look at any
[20:15] situation it's not going to matter how
[20:17] many cubes was in that baby doesn't
[20:19] matter how much uh drugs that was just
[20:21] for this thing
[20:24] that was just for this thing got it yeah
[20:26] that was for this thing that is
[20:28] circumstances
[20:29] that's something you see but your
[20:32] reasoning
[20:34] reasons that there's a problem there
[20:36] but God says hey I got the spirit and
[20:40] soul
[20:41] and that baby can't have faith
[20:44] right no yeah baby can't have faith
[20:47] so the doctors are doing all they can to
[20:49] keep that spirit inside that baby right
[20:52] think about that that officers are doing
[20:55] all they can to keep that spirit inside
[20:56] that baby but your faith is what's going
[20:59] to have to produce
[21:01] that healing of that child
[21:04] that's right so it doesn't matter how
[21:06] many
[21:08] tattoos earrings uh
[21:11] addicts drunk just name everything wives
[21:14] children wild children yeah right things
[21:17] good people preachers no anything we
[21:20] look at those memory reason conservation
[21:22] imagination and that's what Satan can
[21:24] grab a hold of
[21:26] him that's where he walks around them
[21:28] right because remember he reminds me of
[21:31] the things I did before but now remember
[21:32] that doesn't ever come before God right
[21:36] yes I'm forgiving down here of my past
[21:39] sense they will never be forgiven
[21:43] right I mean for God I mean they'll be
[21:46] forgotten they're forgiven I'm sorry but
[21:48] now remember
[21:50] in justification the next day you may
[21:52] smoke another cigarette or a curse or
[21:55] whatever you did before now God starts
[21:57] recording that again
[21:59] if I understand that God starts
[22:01] recording that again
[22:03] right right because it only
[22:05] justification down here only forgives
[22:07] you of your past Sin from that day you
[22:10] said God forgive me he'll forgive you
[22:12] and he won't ever remember that again
[22:14] but now the next week brother Brown said
[22:16] Remember the unclean spirit is still in
[22:19] there that's right
[22:20] he has to be driven out that's right so
[22:23] you still smoke drink cuss and do the
[22:25] things of the world that starts a
[22:26] recording again because I believe
[22:28] there's a lot of people being justified
[22:30] and there's a point in there that I
[22:32] think that if they died and God give
[22:34] them Grace
[22:35] and if they passed away that they'd be
[22:37] giving eternal life later on I because
[22:39] those who he's Justified is already
[22:41] glorified that's right you got to
[22:42] remember that right but true
[22:44] justification leads you to the Holy
[22:46] Ghost God knows that that true
[22:48] justification is going to take you
[22:50] through the steps and then the next step
[22:52] is sanctification where the unclean
[22:54] spirit is driven out
[22:56] see everybody thinks boy I don't cuss
[22:58] your drink no more because I'm born
[22:59] again no ain't got one thing to do with
[23:01] it
[23:02] you should have got that over in
[23:04] sanctification true sanctification
[23:06] showed me that those things were gone
[23:08] and I didn't have to go through them
[23:10] anymore that unclean Spirit was gone out
[23:12] of me
[23:13] and I did not have that desire now look
[23:15] it doesn't mean
[23:18] that if and God help me out it I chewed
[23:21] tobacco for 14 or 15 years so once God
[23:24] saved my soul that night up here he
[23:26] saved me it didn't fill me with the Holy
[23:28] Ghost he saved me okay got it he saved
[23:31] me
[23:32] that desire was gone I believe he
[23:34] justified and Sanctified me the same
[23:35] night
[23:36] why because I had had a background
[23:39] I knew the word of God I knew what I
[23:42] knew what justification was I knew what
[23:43] sanctification was just like these
[23:45] people on the day of Pentecost 120 in
[23:47] the upper room weren't born again
[23:48] Walking With Jesus but Jesus had been
[23:51] planting the word in their heart for
[23:53] three and a half years so they knew once
[23:56] that came
[23:57] quick and what was already in them now
[23:59] see the three thousand downstairs didn't
[24:02] get that because they never heard who is
[24:04] this Jesus all right who is this man you
[24:05] talking about but we believe we're
[24:08] pranked in our hearts we'll see they
[24:10] started down here right they started
[24:12] right here that's why the day of
[24:13] Pentecost there was two births
[24:15] same bird two different stages three
[24:18] thousand downstairs became Spirit babies
[24:20] in Christ
[24:22] amen and Brethren what should we do to
[24:24] be saved we got Peter when the Holy
[24:25] Ghost fell on Peter he didn't walk out
[24:27] and say men and brother what do we got
[24:28] to do to be saved no he was the one that
[24:29] knew what he had to do what they had to
[24:31] do to be saved right so they were right
[24:33] here
[24:34] but God had tutored them 120 in the
[24:36] upper room faith of the fathers
[24:38] got it yes three thousand downstairs was
[24:41] like me and you
[24:43] okay especially the ones that have never
[24:45] heard of the word or never been brought
[24:46] up in the message never heard a thing
[24:48] just came off the street
[24:50] justification sanitation baptism the
[24:52] Holy Ghost has to be a process right you
[24:55] have a question
[24:56] when you say driven out
[24:59] what's that done by the our diligence
[25:01] our praying and the word reading the
[25:04] Bible yeah the words the only things
[25:06] will drive an unclean Spirit out you can
[25:08] crack remember brother Brown he prayed
[25:11] for that woman prayed for that woman he
[25:12] went way back in her life
[25:14] she had left something off that she
[25:16] didn't get forgiven for
[25:18] so that was the Block in her life
[25:20] but remember
[25:23] the the husband and wife that that
[25:25] happened to remember she said he's got
[25:27] something to confess to you well
[25:28] remember if you'll keep reading on a
[25:30] couple of times he makes that point one
[25:33] time he comes in and meet us at well how
[25:35] are they
[25:37] he said they're fine
[25:39] he said they're fully restored in other
[25:41] words back in church well see that was
[25:43] all that unclean Spirit everything maybe
[25:44] they didn't have the new birth maybe
[25:46] they did then
[25:47] we don't know when you say driven out by
[25:51] the word you mean just by sitting
[25:54] listening to the word brother Brown you
[25:56] stay under the fountain and it'll wash
[25:59] you wash by the water of the word the
[26:02] Bible says I can't remember it's in John
[26:03] or somewhere do you remember reports
[26:05] that word says the unclean Spirit goes
[26:07] out of a man walks and dry places but
[26:08] remember
[26:11] Matthew but remember and we're going
[26:13] long I'm sorry remember
[26:16] in sanctification Satan can come back to
[26:19] you because remember them that one
[26:21] Spirit brings seven more of his buddies
[26:23] that's right
[26:24] worse than his that's right because he
[26:27] brings his religious friends with him
[26:29] this time
[26:30] sanctification is the most wonderful
[26:32] place you can be but it's the most
[26:34] horrible place that if you get stuck
[26:36] there you're not born again and if you
[26:38] died
[26:40] you got to go in your work Sam
[26:43] only by the new birth will you not have
[26:45] to worry about your work
[26:48] all right amen amen justification
[26:51] sanctification you're gonna have to
[26:52] stand at the white Throne judgment and
[26:54] you're gonna have to be judged by your
[26:55] words
[26:56] and the Bible says our works is filthy
[26:58] right but if we become born again that
[27:01] unclean Spirit goes out
[27:03] you keep him out by staying here the
[27:06] problem is you look at some people
[27:07] they'll come in here I believe they get
[27:09] Justified
[27:10] I believe they might start working on
[27:12] sanctification but what happens is they
[27:15] get just enough of a religious spirit
[27:17] till they think they got it all and then
[27:19] you don't see them anymore
[27:21] yeah so what happens I've seen it happen
[27:23] 10 times in this church
[27:25] they think they get they get a little
[27:27] religion well who is that
[27:30] there's one thing for sure if you start
[27:32] coming to church and then you quit
[27:33] Church
[27:35] it wasn't God
[27:37] yeah that's pretty plain he just wasn't
[27:40] gone it was gone there for a while
[27:43] but when he brought them Seven Devils
[27:45] his buddies back and made you feel
[27:47] religious and that you can talk to God
[27:50] yourself and you can get it for yourself
[27:51] and you can do all this for yourself
[27:53] that's not the prescription
[27:56] the prescription says go along to the
[27:59] new birth and then you this the faith
[28:01] that you have then listen to this the
[28:03] faith that you have will bring you to
[28:04] church because you know you don't have
[28:06] faith for yourself
[28:08] at that time
[28:10] you have faith in God that he's bringing
[28:13] something people now right here
[28:16] I believe that's faith in yourself
[28:18] what you say to this mountain see
[28:20] remember it comes from it comes from God
[28:22] giving you stuff
[28:23] and I don't mean stuff to be like God
[28:25] giving you things right
[28:28] just like we do as a child but when we
[28:30] grow up I mean Josh is not coming home
[28:32] saying I you know I fix me some
[28:34] breakfast I'm crying I'll go back no
[28:35] he's a man you got to be a man you got
[28:38] to walk in there and say hey I'm a man I
[28:40] can do my own thing now
[28:42] that's the same way with God God don't
[28:44] want you to cry to him all the time
[28:47] push it right here you are him okay and
[28:50] what you say yeah it's gonna happen Ryan
[28:53] you walk in the door and you say look
[28:55] you didn't have to walk in there and say
[28:56] baby get better no you just walked in
[28:58] with a little better attitude
[29:00] with a little more faith positive
[29:02] attitude a little more faith adoption
[29:05] here is fun
[29:07] you get in the head of the ball game
[29:09] yeah no the option is here so that's
[29:12] what we're going to talk about later but
