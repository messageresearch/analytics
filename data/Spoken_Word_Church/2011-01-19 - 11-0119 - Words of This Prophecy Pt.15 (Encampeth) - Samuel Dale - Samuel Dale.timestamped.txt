[5:26] spirit you can say things and and it not
[5:29] hurt you maybe some of you have the gift
[5:31] to do that ability but I can't see that
[5:33] hurts my spirit so I got to get that off

[5:49] you're coming amen right see then
[5:52] that'll hurt your feelings and all but
[5:53] I'm sorry but see that it gets on my
[5:56] feelings and I have to get it off of me
[5:58] and I don't mean to get it off like that
[6:00] I have to get it off of me about saying
[6:02] things okay cuz that's not my nature not
[6:04] my ways all right let's go to the
[6:08] scripture the revelation of Jesus Christ
[6:10] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[6:13] servants things which must shortly come
[6:15] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[6:18] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[6:21] record of the word of God and of the
[6:22] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[6:24] things that he saw blessed is he that
[6:27] readeth and they that hear the words of
[6:29] the prophecy and keep those things which
[6:32] are written therein for the time is at
[6:36] hand now let's go over
[6:43] to
[6:46] PS
[6:55] 34 verse 7 the angel of the Lord in
[6:59] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[7:03] and delivereth them man you may be
[7:06] seated Lord at his Blessing now we gave
[7:09] you a lot of quotes So some not being
[7:12] here Sunday now everybody don't get one
[7:15] because you didn't bring it back there I
[7:17] go say more but I made five copies if
[7:21] you wasn't here Sunday we'll give you a
[7:23] copy of the quotes and things and all
[7:26] and we just we want you to to have them
[7:30] and then the others is a couple of
[7:32] things that we'll use
[7:33] shortly now we've been talking about the
[7:37] angels of God and uh you know trying to
[7:42] bring down and and get to a place of
[7:45] understanding but see my main point is
[7:48] one
[7:49] thing I'm trying to get you and I to
[7:52] realize that the angels of God are real
[7:56] right there are not just spirits
[8:00] they're not just something that makes
[8:03] you feel good or bad or whatever but
[8:06] they're
[8:07] real they're real they're not you know
[8:11] and and in being that
[8:14] they you know they have a job to
[8:18] do you know and we'll put the title to
[8:21] this one you can call it in campus
[8:23] Because I looked that word up in campath
[8:25] it it really means to like in Camp or in
[8:28] other words means to lay Siege Siege you
[8:31] know like an army one Army laying Siege
[8:34] against the other one totally
[8:35] surrounding it totally uh uh you know
[8:39] captivating it and you remember when uh
[8:43] Elijah and you remember who was it Gaza
[8:47] there in the scripture when he you know
[8:49] he went out to look and he saw that or
[8:52] it might have been Elisha but any he saw
[8:54] the the army of the syrians and he
[8:57] thought it was really in bad shape and
[8:59] all and uh oh he was scared to death but
[9:03] the prophet looked out and he said why
[9:05] there's more for us than they are for
[9:08] them you know and that was uh that was
[9:11] truth now we think about
[9:15] angels and I I look this up to just to
[9:18] kind of find out something on it and we
[9:22] think of just a few but you know Jesus
[9:25] said that he could call 12 Legions of
[9:28] angels
[9:30] all right
[9:32] now I looked up some things to try to
[9:34] find out what what that was and
[9:39] according to
[9:41] Webster now Aion is either 3 to
[9:46] 6,000 all right now that's according to
[9:48] Webster all right now in the time
[9:51] basically when Jesus was
[9:54] there and looking it up there was
[9:57] basically 6,800 126 made a
[10:01] legion all right and then you can
[10:04] consider it because they said in foot
[10:06] soldiers it would be about
[10:09] 6,100 foot soldiers would make a
[10:12] legion all right and then in horsman it
[10:15] would be like
[10:17] 726 all right I kept looking to see what
[10:20] brother randam said he says a legion is
[10:23] like about
[10:24] 2,000 that's off the message why Christ
[10:27] speak he said it was like
[10:30] 2,000 well all right now Jesus said he
[10:33] could get 12
[10:34] Legions if he needed
[10:36] them you know that would be what 240,000
[10:42] that the way it would count
[10:46] up 240,000
[10:50] Angels at his
[10:53] disposal so that evidently there must be
[10:56] 240,000
[10:58] huh all right that's my point you know
[11:01] the point I'm trying to get you can get
[11:02] all those numbers and try to add it all
[11:04] up but the point is there's a large
[11:07] number of angels all right that's right
[11:09] and they're real amen and they're not
[11:12] just thoughts of your mind or or
[11:15] something you know right and see we know
[11:18] that they're not as I said like the the
[11:20] world today is is tied up in in Angel
[11:23] forms and different ideas and and they
[11:26] make babies angels and all of the
[11:28] different things
[11:29] and that's all well and good but and
[11:32] then they have female angels you know
[11:35] and they have these at Christmas and
[11:36] little glorious sitting out at the
[11:39] manger scene you know they're always
[11:40] trying to get that little catholic idea
[11:43] in about the female angels and the
[11:46] prophet of God said that now watch his
[11:49] wording he says that the angels are
[11:52] male all right but then he'll say that
[11:55] they have no
[11:57] gender all right right now i' like to
[12:00] give you every all the whole story to
[12:02] where you won't be you know looking down
[12:05] in on it sometimes and say well that
[12:06] would you know oh they they're they're
[12:09] not counted as gender but they are
[12:11] counted as
[12:13] male not
[12:15] female all right but there you know and
[12:18] there's many things to do and the angels
[12:22] of
[12:23] God
[12:25] now we think about that as the prophet
[12:28] it said you know that all born again
[12:32] Believers have a have an angel right all
[12:35] right so I believe that now that's what
[12:37] we've been talking about we see that we
[12:40] think that there's just that one Angel
[12:42] you know at our
[12:46] disposal well how many was it there was
[12:49] only two of them there of of Gaza and
[12:53] Elijah and there was more of them that
[12:58] was gathered around around the scripture
[12:59] said than there was of the whole Syrian
[13:02] Army and the prophet said there were
[13:05] thousands of that Syrian Army am yet
[13:09] there was more Angels there that's right
[13:11] now what I'm trying to do I'm wanting
[13:13] you to to think about how real the
[13:17] prophet said one of these days when we
[13:19] get dire angels will be just as real
[13:22] right you know it's it's people they'll
[13:24] be real it won't be that that you look
[13:26] around and see well there's an angel I
[13:29] guess and I I thought I felt an angel
[13:31] last night you know all of that's well
[13:33] and good that's your business but the
[13:36] thing of it
[13:37] is if those angels are not under the
[13:40] direct leadership of the Holy
[13:43] Spirit then you're dealing with the
[13:45] angels that fell after Satan's lie so
[13:50] there was one3 and brother Rand will
[13:51] quote it 2/3 most of the time but let's
[13:55] just take a third we'll take a third if
[13:57] they're just 24 ,000 uh Angels well what
[14:01] would be a third of that see that's how
[14:03] many angels fa and then you get over
[14:06] there and you try to figure out how that
[14:08] uh the 200,000,000
[14:11] demons that was loosed y all right each
[14:14] one of those would be counted angels of
[14:17] Fallen Angels the demons and how many
[14:20] would that be 200,000,000 200 million is
[14:24] that the way that's counted but see you
[14:26] got a lot of angels right that's my
[14:29] point it's not just that God created a
[14:32] couple of angels yeah I need you I need
[14:35] you no he's got millions of angels
[14:39] evidently y cuz if if 200 million would
[14:43] be what
[14:45] fell then there would be 400 million
[14:49] that didn't fall you know so they just
[14:52] there's a lot of angels now right all
[14:55] right and it's not just one or two
[14:57] little things I was thinking the other
[14:59] day you know and I know I think crazy
[15:01] but I talked to somebody maybe Brother
[15:03] Gary about it but you know they say
[15:06] There's 7 billion people in the world
[15:08] and and people say well if all of the
[15:12] people was here that you know had been
[15:15] in the world you couldn't stand on the
[15:16] earth there wouldn't be enough room and
[15:20] I told him I said well what's the
[15:22] problem you know what's the
[15:25] trouble I mean why couldn't God
[15:31] take a
[15:33] mountain and shrink it to a
[15:38] stone and a lake to a pond and a pond to
[15:43] a
[15:44] puddle right and us to fit in
[15:49] there there'd be a lot of room you know
[15:52] right I mean that's just what I get to
[15:54] thinking about sometimes laying in the
[15:56] middle of the night and I think well
[15:57] Lord that's pretty good you just shrink
[15:59] the whole thing down and we'll all still
[16:02] be there won't be no problems there not
[16:04] troubled with it you know because he
[16:06] could take care of that right may be a
[16:08] carnal but it's still away but now what
[16:12] I want you to think about in this whole
[16:16] point that I'm trying to
[16:17] bring is that angels have a job to
[16:21] do right they were created for a purpose
[16:25] that's right and they have a job to do y
[16:28] and according to Hebrews 1 and4 13:14 we
[16:31] were on the the other day Sunday morning
[16:34] there that there ministering Spirits
[16:37] sent for those that are hirs of
[16:39] Salvation right see then we just think
[16:43] about one little angel that we've
[16:47] got don't think of it like
[16:49] that they were thousands of thousands
[16:53] gathered around Elijah
[16:56] right and how many do we need
[17:00] he said but I never thought about angels
[17:01] having a job well what are they for
[17:04] right amen the holl are holy holy holy
[17:06] Lord God Almighty how many million of us
[17:08] made for that purpose
[17:12] right right am see what what are we
[17:15] dealing with limiting
[17:20] god let's don't do that let's just open
[17:22] it up and let it let it be
[17:25] great and when we get there we'll see
[17:27] those angels that's and we'll see what
[17:29] they're there far right now we covered
[17:33] in the the message our Sunday morning
[17:35] that the angels of God would be counted
[17:38] as
[17:39] gifts now he wasn't talking about
[17:43] speaking in tongues etc etc right but
[17:47] gifts they each one have their own
[17:51] gift there is one dealing with that we
[17:55] gave it and it's on the notes that you
[17:57] have we gave it to her that brother
[18:00] around said the angels of God was called
[18:03] attributes
[18:04] right we see the there you have millions
[18:07] of millions of
[18:10] attributes my point of what I want you
[18:12] to think about lay this morning they're
[18:15] in the bed for a long time for couple
[18:17] hours just thinking on
[18:20] this that each one has a job sure
[18:25] amen and they're connected with you
[18:28] right
[18:30] and what you have need
[18:32] of
[18:34] right I see we we we put it all that's
[18:37] why that that mankind is a showed where
[18:39] the Prophet said that people will say
[18:41] well well we don't need Angels no more
[18:44] we' got the Holy
[18:45] Spirit and I gave you the quotes where
[18:47] he said that there was even a difference
[18:49] in the presence of the holy spirit that
[18:52] made him feel you know sweet and great
[18:56] and and then the other would make him
[18:57] feel
[18:58] you know in in an all when that angel
[19:01] came to him
[19:03] right
[19:05] see we see we we don't consider
[19:10] that but I'm trying to get us ready for
[19:12] when we get over on that other
[19:16] side but there's Angels I've heard
[19:20] people say that you know and all right
[19:22] that's their business maybe they know
[19:23] what you're talking about but they said
[19:25] every empty Pew in the church is filled
[19:26] with angels so every time is an empty P
[19:29] yours empty there's an angel sitting
[19:33] there all right but the thing of what I
[19:35] want you to do and see if we can believe
[19:38] the truth about the angels of God as we
[19:42] read there and it says singular angel of
[19:46] God
[19:48] encampeth right now we say oh that's
[19:52] just a Holy
[19:54] Spirit Well does it encamp around us or
[19:57] what does it do
[20:01] right I said they say well we don't need
[20:04] Angels no more well Paul had one that
[20:07] spoke to him Peter had an angel that
[20:09] spoke to him John had an angel that
[20:12] spoke to him brother R said there's more
[20:14] angels in the New Testament than there
[20:17] was in the old that's what I gave you
[20:18] our
[20:20] Sunday see we just look at it like one
[20:23] or two little angels running
[20:25] around they each one have their
[20:31] Y and you know I gave you the quotes
[20:34] where brother R said that that angel
[20:36] come to him said maybe it's a minor
[20:38] angel I think I've got one in here but
[20:41] anyhow they're there if you out there on
[20:43] the Internet run minor in your computer
[20:45] and you'll see it minor Angel he said
[20:48] the one come to him maybe a minor
[20:50] Angel that's why I said if he's a minor
[20:53] angel that was the reason then he
[20:55] couldn't tell the prophet what those
[20:56] seals were right
[20:58] he had to meet the greater Angel Amen to
[21:02] understand that right got a few more
[21:04] things to go on that when we when we get
[21:06] time but now
[21:11] listen if those
[21:14] angels have a
[21:16] job why don't we believe in
[21:19] it you
[21:21] know and and let them keep their work
[21:23] and do their
[21:26] job you know know that I said brother
[21:29] Brown's called that angel of his a minor
[21:31] Angel
[21:33] right you ever heard him call him an
[21:35] angel of
[21:38] healing on your notes right
[21:43] Hallelujah he had a Healing Ministry
[21:45] didn't he sure amen was he the one that
[21:48] told the people where everything was at
[21:51] what was going on
[21:53] Y and you see I know because when once
[21:56] you start saying that people people's
[21:58] mind connects and tries to to figure
[22:00] things
[22:01] out but see he'll be talking about I'm
[22:04] waiting on the angel of the
[22:06] Lord in a minute he'll say I'm waiting
[22:08] on the Holy
[22:14] Spirit he'll call that angel that come
[22:16] to him pillar
[22:18] fire and then he'll call it the angel of
[22:20] the
[22:22] Lord you see I finally met that angel
[22:25] that was a Shining Light y down there
[22:28] when I was
[22:32] born we we we don't read the
[22:37] message and think about what he's
[22:42] saying 19 in faith is the
[22:45] substance 47
[22:49] 412 Heavenly Father thou H has promised
[22:52] to heal the people I feel that the great
[22:55] me great messenger the angel of healing
[22:59] of God standing near the pull pit at
[23:02] this
[23:05] time angel of
[23:08] healing don't fight the substance

[23:14] some says it's
[23:16] hot look at the next one I was not
[23:18] disobedient to the heavenly vision

[25:27] was an angel of Mercy it was an angel of
[25:30] healing and I believe it was an angel
[25:32] though it seemed so simple but you see
[25:34] God hides in
[25:36] simplic an angel of
[25:40] healing now you see why he had a healing
[25:43] campaign right the healing campaign had
[25:46] to go out right now he said other people

[25:53] are dealing with The Healing
[25:56] Ministry right

[26:07] what he had the the ministry of the Lord
[26:10] Jesus Christ The Healing
[26:13] Ministry ministered by an
[26:16] Angel mhm you'll have two signs yep

[26:22] know the secrets of the heart
[26:24] right you'll be able to tell them where
[26:26] everything's at like try to tell
[26:28] everybody you know tried always to say
[26:30] it they say the first pull they talking

[26:34] that's right amen but what would he do
[26:37] he'd say you got cancer it's on your
[26:39] left lung now the hand didn't tell him
[26:42] where the cancer
[26:44] was the hand told him he had
[26:49] cancer he was a prophet the opening of
[26:52] the word told him where the rest was
[26:54] at do you see what I'm talking about see
[26:59] special gifts attributes of the angel of
[27:10] God all right I gave you
[27:14] these some more that goes with it so you
[27:17] read them where brother Brown said the
[27:19] angel of God angels of God comes down
[27:22] and encampeth around you or encamped
[27:25] right encamped in Camp is only used in
[27:28] the Bible brother doesn't use the word
[27:30] encampeth he uses the word
[27:32] encamp
[27:34] huh yeah he says stay there
[27:42] right then Angels stay
[27:45] there what great thing did Elijah do to
[27:48] bring the Angels down to his
[27:52] presence he knew there there all the
[27:54] time right that's it he wasn't afraid it
[27:58] was Gaza that needed his eyes open
[28:01] y amen and if we really just would
[28:04] realize those angels are there all the
[28:06] time right amen how many of them you
[28:09] need God making his promise
[28:12] 56 beginning end of the Gentile
[28:15] dispensation
[28:17] 55 message Called Love
[28:21] 58 letting off the pressure
[28:26] 62 but L Bemus 5
[28:30] 55 law having a shadow
[28:33] 56 influence
[28:37] 62 I'm just going down and reading these
[28:39] off influence in 63
[28:42] 803 read
[28:45] them they encamp about
[28:49] you they don't leave that's
[28:53] right well if I could just if that angel
[28:56] would just come and be with me
[28:58] and where'd you get that
[29:02] from where'd you get the
[29:05] idea the Bible said it encampeth
[29:07] encampeth means to Siege in other words
[29:10] surround right now what do you have need
[29:13] of
[29:14] tonight there's an angel
[29:17] specially specially designed for what we
[29:20] have need
[29:21] of you need
[29:23] healing right well I just thought it was
[29:27] be believing in what Jesus done at
[29:30] Calvary
[29:33] amen but what about an angel involved in
[29:42] it now like I said and I say it again
[29:45] the prophet said if that angel said
[29:48] anything contrary to the word he's not
[29:52] the angel of the
[29:54] Lord does that solve a problem
[29:57] right that's why brother R said we we
[30:00] have these people get all tied up with
[30:01] angels you know seeing
[30:04] things right big man that I can call his
[30:07] name he'd see angels in his home his
[30:10] children and even see angels all right I
[30:12] ain't going to argue with him I wouldn't
[30:14] argue with none whatsoever but where it
[30:16] led him to the word I hope he hears
[30:20] this of course you know what he believes
[30:22] it has ain't a Baptist in the world that
[30:25] don't believe God LED them to the
[30:26] Baptist Church Church come on

[30:35] we brother dick Us in the Presbyterian
[30:38] you think he was wrong no you thought
[30:40] she was
[30:44] right you get my point I'm just trying
[30:46] to get you to to look at the fact of
[30:51] angels and angels having a specific job
[30:56] right and it's involving
[31:00] you it's something for
[31:04] you to wor that
[31:07] you can have confidence
[31:11] right brother D aren't you afraid when
[31:14] you're preaching why would I be
[31:16] afraid I've always said if I'm wrong
[31:19] somebody corrects me thank God I I got
[31:22] the benefit out of
[31:24] it but if I'm right I'm not worried
[31:26] about it
[31:27] right you're not worried about preaching
[31:30] to who or what no
[31:32] sir right from the pope of Rome to the
[31:34] people of this
[31:36] message amen I just tell you what I
[31:39] believe see I believe angels are real
[31:43] amen I believe they're real more real
[31:46] than what we are see we think beating on
[31:48] the pet we think this is wood this is
[31:51] something great
[31:53] tangible remember the Angels come before
[31:55] this did right amen y created by the
[32:00] Living God
[32:02] Amen and they got a job to do
[32:05] right they're dealing with you and I
[32:08] yeah all right so I hope you caught all
[32:11] of that I wrot myself myself a bunch of
[32:14] notes to cover some
[32:17] things but I hope you'll just
[32:21] listen angels are real they're not just
[32:25] something that we feel
[32:28] we just oh I feel I can just feel this
[32:31] presence what are you talking
[32:35] about I feel the presence of the Holy
[32:37] Spirit don't
[32:38] you sure I
[32:41] do but you know I've never seen the Holy
[32:44] Spirit
[32:46] right but I have seen other other things
[32:50] that I believe was related to that why
[32:53] because it's never taken me away from
[32:54] the word right did they tell you
[32:57] anything no sir
[33:01] read just D to let me
[33:04] know let me know not to be
[33:08] afraid because I know where that the
[33:11] word is has told me where I can stand
[33:13] all right now let's get started on the
[33:15] message
[33:16] tonight right now if you flip over on
[33:20] your notes
[33:22] to number
[33:25] 17 we cover the others there's a couple
[33:29] in there I want to hold till the later
[33:31] about the angel of the Covenant and try
[33:33] to bring it back in because Jesus Christ
[33:36] is the Angel of the
[33:38] Covenant let's get started on this part
[33:43] now we've dealt with that there's many
[33:48] angels that's what I hope you're
[33:50] catching tonight there there's angels
[33:52] for they've got different
[33:54] jobs different things to do
[33:58] they're connected with your
[34:00] salvation and we'll read in a minute
[34:02] where the ones that drove us out is now
[34:05] driving us
[34:07] in all right now and then to see and to
[34:13] realize that they're
[34:17] here why are we
[34:23] afraid why are we afraid when the doctor
[34:26] tells us we've got cancer why are we
[34:34] afraid why are we afraid when something
[34:36] goes
[34:38] wrong when we're supposed to believe
[34:40] that the angels of God are encamped
[34:42] about us and I keep saying that over
[34:44] where other people out there realize it
[34:47] the Bible says the angel of the Lord
[34:51] singular
[34:53] encampeth brother Brandon will quote
[34:55] that 98% of the time as the Angels
[34:59] plural
[35:01] right of God
[35:04] encampeth all right
[35:08] now it's all the Holy Spirit
[35:13] right but to just say it's the Holy
[35:16] Spirit
[35:18] right it's the like to say well that's
[35:21] just
[35:24] God well yeah it's it's just
[35:30] God no they're Angels amen under the
[35:35] leadership of the holy
[35:38] spirit it's not to say the Holy Spirit
[35:41] it wasn't the Holy Spirit the prophet
[35:43] said that woke Paul up and told him to
[35:45] not be afraid right he said there he had
[35:48] the holy
[35:51] spirit it's not the holy spirit that
[35:54] told Peter the thing it's the angels of
[35:56] the Lord am that told
[35:59] him all right but see they're under
[36:03] direct supervision as we' call it they
[36:07] make no
[36:08] move just as it was down there when the
[36:11] Hebrew children you know would in the
[36:13] fiery
[36:16] furnace wormwood come up and said I'll
[36:18] put it out
[36:20] right I can take care of that I'm
[36:23] quoting brother random you know
[36:25] that he said you've done a wonderful job
[36:28] and great but said I'm going myself am
[36:33] thank he even said Gabriel came up we
[36:38] ain't got to that
[36:40] yet he said Gabriel came up and said
[36:43] I'll go he said you're a great
[36:45] angel I said it's not your
[36:49] job see wormwood was to destroy the
[36:52] world he controls the water now watch
[36:58] I guess you think when he got through
[37:00] with the water that now he's setting up
[37:03] in heaven twiddling his
[37:05] STS Ain got nothing else to
[37:11] do who's controlling the water now to
[37:14] keep it from destroying the world oh the
[37:16] Moon it well I'm glad you thought of
[37:19] that go who controls the
[37:22] moon
[37:25] amen you see one of these days we'll
[37:28] realize how God could leave
[37:31] heaven and come to Earth Y and the world
[37:35] keep running right amen and all their
[37:38] hearts keep beating and all the wind
[37:40] keeps blowing all the rain keeps
[37:45] falling somebody's in
[37:50] charge they got a job to do worm wood
[37:54] you've done a good job this is my phrase
[37:56] in there
[37:58] you destroyed the world with water now
[38:00] keep it from doing it
[38:02] again so every day he's controlling
[38:06] it make sure that Moon keeps rolling
[38:09] just
[38:11] right there the water still here that
[38:14] was in the flood come on
[38:16] folks right what is the world 2/3 water
[38:20] oh yeah all it take is a Moon turning
[38:22] just a high to cover it right back
[38:25] over but wormwood's keeping it from
[38:27] doing
[38:31] it that's right Gabriel I'll go down
[38:35] you're a great Angel
[38:38] but I'm going myself he
[38:42] said what Gabriel do we'll get to it one
[38:46] of these
[38:48] days Gabriel announced the first coming
[38:50] of Jesus Christ and Gabriel announces
[38:53] the second coming of Jesus Christ amen
[38:57] that's corre run those quotes in your
[38:58] computer till we get
[39:01] back it'll be a few weeks
[39:04] probably give you time to look up some
[39:07] things Gabriel's job is not to go down
[39:10] in the FY furnace
[39:12] right his job is to announce a second
[39:15] coming
[39:20] amen I'm going brother around now
[39:24] Michael amen Michael
[39:27] say I'll
[39:28] go and we know Michael is
[39:33] Christ he said
[39:36] no you've done your
[39:41] job you still got more work to
[39:45] do and I'm going the
[39:50] South you see Michaels one to run the
[39:52] devil Out of Heaven
[39:55] Lucifer
[39:57] Michael keeps him
[40:00] out he allows him to go back into the
[40:03] presence of God to talk to God but he's
[40:06] not allowed for anything
[40:10] else Michael is going to stand up and
[40:13] fight for Israel
[40:16] amen right that's
[40:19] right you see Michael was the one that
[40:22] Gabriel could not get back to Daniel
[40:25] that's right
[40:27] Michael the great Prince is called done
[40:31] his
[40:33] job you see what I'm talking about in
[40:36] other words God was saying you've done
[40:38] your jobs you got your jobs to do take
[40:41] care of that I'm going myself he
[40:44] said and when they looked down in there
[40:46] the man said
[40:47] what AM forth man is like unto the Son
[40:51] of
[40:52] God we might as well go ahead and cover
[40:55] that part cuz who is
[40:58] that look at number 15 on your
[41:03] notes I was going the other way but
[41:05] we'll go this
[41:08] way he talking about the children of
[41:10] Israel the pillar of fire that led the
[41:13] children of Israel they followed the
[41:15] pillar of fire rather that that was the
[41:17] angel of the Covenant that talked to
[41:19] Moses in the burning
[41:24] bush who was that come down in the the
[41:28] fiery
[41:30] furnace one like un the Son of
[41:36] God who was the angel of the Covenant
[41:39] Christ Moses forsook Egypt esteeming the
[41:42] reproach of the Angel of the Covenant
[41:44] you say you ain't quoting that correctly
[41:46] read it esteeming the reproach of Christ
[41:49] greater riches than that of
[41:53] Egypt right he saw Christ and what had
[41:55] been leading
[41:58] him
[42:02] right he realized it that's on the
[42:05] message we would see Jesus
[42:08] 62704 these are just a couple now I just
[42:10] picked two influence 1963
[42:15] 1114 Moses when was he was in the
[42:17] presence of God that watched him watch
[42:21] him by the pillar of fire that was back
[42:23] in that burning
[42:24] bush the Lord spoke out and anyone knows
[42:28] that Pillar of Fire was
[42:30] Christ he was the angel of the Covenant
[42:34] Moses forsook Egypt
[42:36] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[42:39] riches than that of Egypt so it was the
[42:41] angel of the
[42:43] Covenant and when he appeared in that
[42:45] burning bu by this by the side way in
[42:48] front of Moses and the voice says take
[42:50] off your shoes who is he talking
[42:53] about the angel of the Covenant
[42:57] the one who was going to come and do
[42:59] each
[43:01] one you'll find it in
[43:04] the acts 7 and
[43:07] 33-38 that
[43:09] Jesus y it says was in the burning bush
[43:14] that spoke to Moses who Jesus
[43:18] Christ the angel of the
[43:21] Covenant why would we
[43:24] worry when the angels have jobs to take
[43:26] care of to take care of you and I but
[43:28] the angel of the Covenant is in charge
[43:30] of all
[43:33] right did not God tell Moses at the
[43:36] burning bush he said my angel will go
[43:38] before thee and he said nothing won't be
[43:41] able to stand in other words in your way
[43:43] wouldn't that what he said to the
[43:44] prophet when he come to
[43:48] him he said you better fear him because
[43:51] my name is in him is what he told
[43:54] Moses see the angel of the Covenant was
[43:57] there Christ is who I'm talking
[44:01] about but the angels have jobs to
[44:06] do you're out driving down the
[44:09] highway and all of this garbage is going
[44:12] on today out there and all of the wrecks
[44:14] that you think right that you really are
[44:17] a good
[44:20] driver oh yeah Bo I tell you what I a
[44:23] good driver I just know how to with you
[44:25] I just
[44:29] yeah and what about that angel taking
[44:32] care of
[44:35] you what about
[44:38] it how come it hadn't killed
[44:43] you all right we'll get back a little
[44:46] bit more on that one CU I want to speak
[44:48] some more on that part but I just want
[44:51] you to see that the holy spirit is the
[44:54] Angel of the Lord yes yes he's the angel
[44:57] of the Covenant Christ is the Angel of
[44:59] the Covenant the Lord Jesus Christ is
[45:01] the Angel of the Covenant given every
[45:03] title where you won't run off on a
[45:05] something to it's all there yes but that
[45:09] all of those angels are under direct
[45:14] leadership y of the Holy
[45:17] Spirit to take care of you and
[45:19] I they're a sign for that job if I
[45:23] always told you I'll have to apologize
[45:26] when I get to her cuz I've kept mine
[45:27] busy I know right
[45:32] amen that's not a
[45:34] joke
[45:36] listen each one of those angels then can
[45:39] be called in
[45:41] manifestation of the angel of
[45:47] God just as we have seen that God has
[45:52] manifested has made manifest his being
[45:57] that he's trying to make
[46:01] known and he's trying to make those
[46:03] angels known
[46:04] too he's wanting to see brother Gary
[46:06] what's going
[46:12] on what makes your heart beat that's
[46:15] right oh it's
[46:19] just
[46:21] yeah what keeps you
[46:24] alive we you go to sleep and you go into
[46:27] a total unconscious State what keeps you
[46:33] alive remember they're assigned to take
[46:35] care of the erors of Salvation that's
[46:38] what we want to get to see each one of
[46:40] them has a work to do all under the
[46:45] direct leadership of the Holy
[46:47] Spirit but a work for them to do
[46:51] individually so then don't just say it's
[46:53] the Holy Spirit I said a moment ago go
[46:56] no more than to say well that's just God
[46:59] you know that's I don't know what y'all
[47:00] get so all excited about Father Son and
[47:03] Holy Ghost it's just
[47:08] God he's got three
[47:11] manifestations and you cross up those
[47:13] manifestations what have you
[47:15] done each one of those manifestations is
[47:21] assigned a specific thing to
[47:24] do right
[47:27] right now right all right let's try to
[47:31] deal with one that let's go to Isaiah
[47:38] 6 try to get into this one about the
[47:40] Surs cuz we were talking about this is
[47:42] the Bible study and they didn't know I
[47:44] was going to go ahead and cover all this
[47:45] and I didn't want to tell everybody I
[47:47] was going to do it either so I wanted to
[47:50] kind of keep it to myself and get to
[47:53] it but listen
[47:58] the word seraphim is only used here in
[48:01] Isaiah 6 the other times it will be used
[48:04] as
[48:05] cherubims all right now we're going to
[48:07] see how interrelation that cherubim and
[48:10] that cim is right but each one of them
[48:12] has to have a job yep
[48:15] right but they can be the same the
[48:18] brother R say they're the
[48:21] same you there Isaiah
[48:24] 6 in the in the year that King Uzziah
[48:28] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon
[48:31] the
[48:31] throne high and lifted up and his train
[48:34] filled the temple above it stood The
[48:37] Sims each one had six wings with Twain
[48:41] he covered his face and with Twain he
[48:44] covered his feet and with Twain he did
[48:46] fly and one cried un Cried unto another
[48:50] and said holy holy holy is the Lord God
[48:52] of hosts the whole earth is full of his
[48:54] glory and the post of the temple moved
[48:57] at the voice of him that cried and the
[48:59] house was filled with smoke then said I
[49:03] woe is me for I am undone because I'm a
[49:06] man of unclean lips and I dwell in the
[49:08] midst of people of unclean lips for my
[49:11] eyes have seen the king of the king the
[49:13] Lord of
[49:14] hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto
[49:17] me having a CO live coat in his hand
[49:20] which he had taken from the tong with
[49:22] the tongues from off the Altar and he
[49:24] laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this
[49:27] hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity
[49:29] is taken away and thy sin is
[49:32] purged also I heard the voice of the
[49:34] Lord
[49:36] saying who shall I S whom shall I send
[49:39] and whom will go farest then said I here
[49:42] am I send
[49:44] me this is the great Isaiah that wrote
[49:48] 66 books in the
[49:52] Bible that
[49:54] Isaiah needed some cleansing
[49:58] before he could
[50:01] go great prophet raised the prophet
[50:05] raised brother rown said in the in the
[50:07] king's
[50:08] palace with the King there but when the
[50:12] king got exalted
[50:16] up brother R said Isaiah was praying and
[50:20] crying out before the Lord because of
[50:22] what the king had done you remember the
[50:24] king went in and told him he's going to
[50:25] all for incense and he immediately was
[50:27] struck with Leprosy when he did they had
[50:29] to put him in a house to himself the
[50:31] rest of his life and Isaiah was really
[50:34] concerned and he went to the house of
[50:36] the Lord to pray and as he did he fell
[50:38] into a trance the prophet said and this
[50:40] is what he said he saw
[50:44] right he saw a way that he could
[50:49] go Isaiah said I can't go I've got
[50:52] unclean lips and I dwell among people
[50:54] that's got unclean Li there nobody can
[50:57] take your message Lord and
[51:00] go so here come a
[51:03] serim one ass sign for a special job
[51:07] y not to keep the world running not to
[51:11] hold the water from destroying it
[51:16] right not to
[51:19] announce the first and second coming
[51:23] m not to fight with the Devil
[51:29] and
[51:31] conquering here comes a
[51:35] zim and Scofield even knows it because
[51:37] they knew the difference between the
[51:39] word seraphim and cherubim right now he
[51:42] interrelates it and brother brandham
[51:43] does too but Scofield if you go down in
[51:46] your footnotes you'll see that this
[51:48] seraphim here is considered as to be a
[51:52] burner right
[51:54] yep
[51:56] his job is a special
[51:59] one to keep the worshipper
[52:02] clean Isaiah knew he needed to be
[52:04] cleansed before he could take the
[52:06] message and the seraphim got on his job
[52:09] and done
[52:10] it took a cold and cleansed his lips
[52:15] right what about the one that keeps us
[52:17] clean
[52:19] amen what about it what do these angels
[52:22] have to do with
[52:24] us now we'll start on number 17 on the
[52:28] notes Jehovah Gyra part two 1962
[52:33] 706 God put sarim there what's their job
[52:37] we'll get back to Isaiah in a minute but
[52:40] I want you to get this
[52:42] point it didn't just appear with
[52:45] Isaiah right the seraphim even though
[52:49] he's not mentioned as a
[52:52] seraphim with a s somebody hearing me
[52:55] say it cuz it not not much different
[52:57] than cherim
[52:59] sarim sarim spelled with an s look where
[53:03] he started his
[53:04] job what are you to do sarim I'm to keep
[53:07] the
[53:08] worshipper I'm to deal with the ARs of
[53:16] Salvation right so what did he
[53:20] do God put the seraphim there guarding
[53:23] that
[53:24] tree
[53:25] that no one would touch it now he's got
[53:29] sarapes out trying to drive them into
[53:32] the
[53:33] tree that's right same one that drove us
[53:37] away from the tree cuz see we couldn't
[53:39] do that I listening uh we was last night
[53:42] to where the Prophet said they would
[53:44] have took of that tree and liveed
[53:45] forever right we know they couldn't part
[53:48] took of the tree and lived eternally but
[53:51] they would have lived
[53:52] forever in a fallen condition and that
[53:55] couldn't work so we had to drive us away
[53:58] right he said well it would just ain't
[54:00] no way they could have got there well
[54:02] let see that's like we're tied up that
[54:05] there ain't no such thing as Angels cuz
[54:07] I never seen
[54:10] one I don't believe in them that's what
[54:12] people says you know CU I've never seen
[54:16] one well you're a prophet I hope you C
[54:19] the things that I covered he said a
[54:21] preacher is even an angel amen Paul
[54:24] called him that
[54:26] and then you got angels of the church AG
[54:30] Messengers then you got what we covered
[54:32] there Sunday morning that you've even
[54:34] got investigating Angels flying around
[54:37] and flying
[54:39] saucers to
[54:42] investigate and we read here tonight
[54:44] that you got a healing
[54:47] Angels right and we read that they're
[54:50] encamped
[54:51] about that they don't leave they stay
[54:56] with us
[54:57] always so what do you have need
[55:00] of well now brother D what I'm going to
[55:02] do is I'm going to try to find out which
[55:05] Angel going to help
[55:10] us like I said Sunday what good would it
[55:14] do to find out if my angel was so and
[55:17] so they said brother brand why don't you
[55:19] ask that angel what his name is he said
[55:21] you don't talk when he's
[55:23] there right
[55:27] instead of wan to know what the angel
[55:29] had to say about them they W know what
[55:30] his name what's his name I want know his
[55:33] name I got to know his name I I
[55:38] want Heaven helpless that's
[55:41] right what good does it know what
[55:43] brother Dale's got what have you got you
[55:47] better be trying to find your angels and
[55:49] I gave them to you the other
[55:51] day I've got them laying back there in
[55:53] my office right now where the prophet of
[55:55] God said the reason we don't see Angels
[55:58] is because we're not dedicated enough
[56:01] right right now that's what he
[56:04] said he said that angel comes to me he
[56:07] said when I'm fasting and
[56:14] praying he said by being a born again
[56:17] Christian that put us into a realm that
[56:20] made us subject to the
[56:23] supernatural and the reason we don't see
[56:26] Angels is that we are not dedicated
[56:30] enough right but then somebody else say
[56:33] something about oh they think they
[56:36] something well they try to make
[56:38] something out
[56:42] ofel you'll answer for that part if
[56:45] that's what you think about
[56:46] me because I've always tried to get you
[56:49] to see the angelist with you
[56:53] right cuz that's the only one's going to
[56:55] do you any good the angel with me ain't
[56:58] going to do you one bit of good right
[57:00] it's the one with you right you got to
[57:03] be dealing with
[57:04] it Paul down there in in the boat would
[57:08] call out angel I need you to come down
[57:10] here and said which one are you well I
[57:13] guess you're so and so he said I'm
[57:15] decided to get Peter out of jail I got a
[57:16] job to
[57:18] do I'm not
[57:21] coming I got a job to do right mind is
[57:25] to get Peter out of jail
[57:28] y but you see we want to find out all
[57:31] this about angels instead of trying to
[57:33] deal with what God's dealing with you
[57:34] and I how is he trying to minister the
[57:38] to the hours of Salvation don't you
[57:40] believe it you're an hour of Salvation
[57:41] amen don't you believe you're a child of
[57:44] God but you see that Surfin back
[57:48] there now we'll get to it in a second
[57:51] what is it going down uncertain sound
[57:53] 1962 74
[57:56] there were two trees in the Garden of
[57:57] Eden one of them was life and one was
[57:59] death somebody was asking me this
[58:01] question the other day and I didn't mean
[58:03] to bring this in but when I found it I
[58:05] thought that'd be a good
[58:06] placez A lot of people think that that
[58:09] Eve was a tree of death
[58:12] yeah well now look what your Prophet
[58:15] said one of them was life and one was
[58:18] death one of them was the woman the
[58:21] other one was the
[58:23] man now he called him two trees in the
[58:26] garden the man and the woman y but he's
[58:29] not talking about Adam and Eve
[58:36] right the life that come by the woman
[58:39] dies but life that come by man lives see
[58:42] what did just build that up get the man
[58:44] up so big oh yeah here's the main part
[58:48] Sims guarded the Tree of Life which was
[58:50] the bread of life that come from God out
[58:52] of heaven now you know where that go to
[58:55] doing who was it that come down in the
[58:57] wilderness to the children of
[59:01] Israel who brought the
[59:03] bread are you listening I'm trying to
[59:05] get you to see that angels have a
[59:09] job they're not just floating around
[59:12] they got a job to
[59:13] do it's to the HS of Salvation the
[59:16] children of Israel were the HS of
[59:18] Salvation
[59:21] amen and God was taking care of
[59:25] Bringing Down the
[59:28] bread maybe one bringing down the
[59:32] quail maybe wormwood was there to make
[59:34] sure that when they struck that rock
[59:36] that they got the water amen you see
[59:39] what I'm trying to get you to
[59:41] see the angels have
[59:45] jobs they're a sign to
[59:49] that influence
[59:51] 1962 1013 number 22 when you not
[59:56] he's talking about how they saw the
[59:57] throne and the thing his train was
[59:59] following him and he lifted up in the
[1:00:01] heavens and he saw back and forth the
[1:00:05] temple Sims flying Oh My Sims it means
[1:00:09] burners the word seraphim
[1:00:12] means which is next to the altar
[1:00:15] actually the seraphim is the one who
[1:00:18] receives the
[1:00:19] sacrifice and cleanses the worshipper
[1:00:22] and then presents him to God
[1:00:26] now don't you want to believe in that
[1:00:29] AEL sir I sure want to believe he's got
[1:00:32] a job to do I want him to do that job
[1:00:34] don't
[1:00:37] you in position of God to serim does Now
[1:00:40] The Sims was Angelic beings and watch
[1:00:44] and they are the very next ones to God
[1:00:47] right at the altar and they receive the
[1:00:49] sacrifice it shows the justice of God
[1:00:51] that sin cannot come in the presence
[1:00:53] unless it's been a tone far see these
[1:00:56] seraphim you remember in the church ages
[1:00:59] how that they guarded them gospels one
[1:01:01] on either side you remember we took them
[1:01:03] back to the Garden of Eden with a
[1:01:04] flaming sword there to guard the
[1:01:08] altar right next to
[1:01:10] God
[1:01:14] burners he said
[1:01:17] what is the one who receives the
[1:01:20] sacrifice and cleanses the
[1:01:23] worshipper
[1:01:27] now you remember when Jacob laid
[1:01:30] down put his head on a
[1:01:34] rock had a vision
[1:01:38] dream he saw an angel look from where he
[1:01:40] was going into heaven and angels
[1:01:44] ascending and descending the latter what
[1:01:49] were those angels doing
[1:01:51] right taking up his offering
[1:01:57] bring and bringing him back a
[1:02:01] blessing
[1:02:04] right taking up his
[1:02:06] offering are we not to present our
[1:02:08] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:02:11] acceptable unto the Lord which is our
[1:02:13] reasonable
[1:02:15] service then that angel is taking you
[1:02:18] sacrifice right what did the prophet say
[1:02:20] about
[1:02:21] adoption that that angel the Holy Spirit
[1:02:24] that is your
[1:02:25] guardian and said he goes before the
[1:02:28] father and says he's acting just like
[1:02:29] you
[1:02:31] right he said take him out
[1:02:34] now in front of the
[1:02:37] people
[1:02:39] right you see what I'm talking
[1:02:42] about Surs are to keep us
[1:02:46] clean what happens up there in the Book
[1:02:49] of Revelations I said the other day
[1:02:51] about it over the Book of Revelation you
[1:02:53] got the prayers of the Saints
[1:02:56] right and the Bible says they're poured
[1:02:59] out and that's what causes the
[1:03:02] tribulation period is when the prayers
[1:03:05] of the Saints are poured out cuz a
[1:03:07] nobody praying
[1:03:09] anymore that God will
[1:03:14] hear amen
[1:03:18] burners to keep us
[1:03:20] clean influence 63 112 the vision it's
[1:03:26] is simple he saw God upon his throne
[1:03:28] lifted up and note the Heavenly Surin
[1:03:31] which means burners a special designed
[1:03:36] person
[1:03:39] right
[1:03:45] oh we talk a lot about the devil what he
[1:03:48] is but around calls him a
[1:03:53] person
[1:03:55] then when we say person Body Spirit Soul
[1:03:58] he's not
[1:04:03] that that's where our minds gets taught
[1:04:05] and that's what I'm I thought of it this
[1:04:07] week I might as well put it on here cuz
[1:04:09] see when I give you something I
[1:04:10] underline what I want you to do I give
[1:04:12] you the whole paragraph where you can go
[1:04:13] read it to see if I'm talking right but
[1:04:15] you know what most of you don't do when
[1:04:17] I read what I want to read you look down
[1:04:20] and you keep on reading so you don't
[1:04:21] know what I
[1:04:23] said
[1:04:28] my brother Dale I have a right to read
[1:04:30] if I want to bless God read all you want
[1:04:33] to I'm just trying to make a point right
[1:04:36] you'll lose the whole point how many of
[1:04:39] you caught what I said instead of
[1:04:41] reading on down below there but Isaiah
[1:04:43] in the temple
[1:04:45] right how many of you understood what I
[1:04:48] said Satan is a person but he's not a
[1:04:51] body spirit and soul person
[1:04:55] right the holy spirit is a
[1:04:58] person but it's not Body Spirit and
[1:05:03] soul see when we say
[1:05:05] person we look at a human
[1:05:11] element He says this seril is a
[1:05:13] specially designed
[1:05:18] person he not a body Spirit Soul human
[1:05:21] being right he's a created angel of
[1:05:27] God a
[1:05:32] person see here what we do influence 631
[1:05:36] 1212 that was paragraph E40 this is
[1:05:41] E9 now watch what he says look what this
[1:05:44] Angel does this surf him or maybe you
[1:05:48] never have accepted him at all and you'd
[1:05:51] like to say this morning God let that
[1:05:54] word sink into me until I can cover my
[1:05:57] face in humility and cover my
[1:06:01] feet and kneel at your altar until the
[1:06:04] Sims will wave the glory of God over my
[1:06:09] soul and cleanse me with his holy
[1:06:16] fire he's talking about salvation
[1:06:20] right you mean the seraphim has
[1:06:22] something to do with Sal
[1:06:26] right
[1:06:28] okay influence 62
[1:06:33] 1013 he's talking about when Holy Angels
[1:06:37] in other words you say you're Methodist
[1:06:39] Baptist Presbyterian P Who Are You When
[1:06:41] Holy Angels hide their holy face under
[1:06:44] the wings to stand in the presence of
[1:06:46] God when Angels a being that's actually
[1:06:50] Beyond
[1:06:51] Angels the Angels don't stand there only
[1:06:55] the seraphim they're beyond
[1:06:58] angels and God so holy until they cover
[1:07:02] their face in his
[1:07:07] presence
[1:07:10] sures
[1:07:12] worshippers burners to keep the
[1:07:14] worshipper
[1:07:22] clean keep
[1:07:26] going influence 1963
[1:07:30] 803 I like to use these because the
[1:07:33] people are say well after the seals he
[1:07:34] changed well this is where I'm reading
[1:07:37] from after the seals broke on most of
[1:07:41] these no and we notice that the Heavenly
[1:07:44] serim was flying back and forth in the
[1:07:46] temple now the serim actually the Hebrew
[1:07:48] word there is burners they were the one
[1:07:50] who offered incense and the
[1:07:58] sacrifice
[1:08:00] okay it's just a higher order of
[1:08:03] angels that makes a way for the sinner
[1:08:08] as long as there's a
[1:08:10] sacrifice and these seraphim especially
[1:08:12] these burners had a special office they
[1:08:15] stayed right in the presence of God
[1:08:18] they're the same as the
[1:08:21] cherubims they were right and they were
[1:08:23] right in the Pres pres of
[1:08:27] God influence
[1:08:29] 63803 that was paragraph 67 this is
[1:08:33] paragraph
[1:08:35] 72 when seraphim the highest order of
[1:08:38] angels right by The Mercy Seat the
[1:08:41] burners of the sacrifice had to cover
[1:08:43] their holy face to stand in his presence
[1:08:46] and here they was God sitting up there
[1:08:49] on his throne and these cherubims going
[1:08:51] back and forth screaming day and night
[1:08:53] holy holy holy is the Lord God do you
[1:08:55] know what I'm meaning
[1:08:57] influence paragraph
[1:08:59] 6063
[1:09:01] 11:14 we find in this Vision that he saw
[1:09:04] God lifted up high on the throne then he
[1:09:06] noticed another thing note around him
[1:09:09] was in the temple where he was at where
[1:09:12] these Heavenly
[1:09:13] seraphim if you'll check that word I
[1:09:15] think it's only used about twice once or
[1:09:18] twice in the
[1:09:19] Bible and it's not
[1:09:22] cherubims this
[1:09:25] and you just said a minute ago sh and
[1:09:27] Chans put it right
[1:09:29] together now watch you it's not
[1:09:33] cherubims but it's next to
[1:09:35] cherubims something like an Angelic
[1:09:38] being and yet it isn't an
[1:09:42] angel it is an
[1:09:45] angel but it's a special
[1:09:48] person what they are they're burners of
[1:09:50] sacrifice in the Bible where the
[1:09:52] sacrifice of course
[1:09:54] brings in or leads in makes a way for
[1:09:57] the sinner to Holiness and these serim
[1:10:00] burning the sacrifice which was required
[1:10:03] they want to that was their duty but
[1:10:06] brother
[1:10:07] taale Jesus died he's up in heaven he
[1:10:09] ain't burning
[1:10:13] sacrifices why
[1:10:15] not yeah ain't burning animals
[1:10:22] right I ain't burning lambs and right
[1:10:25] goats and
[1:10:31] sheep they're worshippers to keep me and
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:36] clean their job is to keep us
[1:10:39] clean I'm clean brother I got the Holy
[1:10:45] Ghost
[1:10:47] amen but what about our daily lives yeah
[1:10:52] right that's right
[1:10:55] yeah maybe we'll understand one of these
[1:10:58] days why the Bible
[1:11:04] says by David in the
[1:11:06] Psalms blessed is the man to whom God
[1:11:09] will not impute sin right blessed let me
[1:11:13] paraphrase it all right blessed is the
[1:11:16] man that has a burner in heaven a
[1:11:19] seraphim that can take his life and keep
[1:11:22] it clean to where God can use them

[1:11:38] forget because if he don't if your sins
[1:11:42] are forgiven he's
[1:11:43] forgotten maybe some Angel has to take
[1:11:46] care of

[1:12:54] sacrifice and offers it and here they

[1:14:34] the kings of the earth bring their honor
[1:14:36] into the
[1:14:37] city we're always going to be that way
[1:14:41] because God is not a Sears and Rob book
[1:14:43] Harmony House amen I like
[1:14:48] that he is a god of reiy and he makes
[1:14:51] one way and one makes one one way and
[1:14:55] one another but we must serve him in the
[1:14:57] way that God made us and be glad and
[1:15:00] stay behind his word that's the way God
[1:15:02] Did
[1:15:06] It influence 64 63
[1:15:11] 11:14 the prophet
[1:15:14] confessed caused him to say I'm a man of
[1:15:17] unclean lips a
[1:15:19] prophet God we know another Vision like
[1:15:21] that when he saw up
[1:15:24] and saw these cleansing P these
[1:15:27] cleansing power of God now watch how God
[1:15:30] did he sent one of the shims and took
[1:15:32] the tongue took the tongue took a hot
[1:15:35] Cal off the F fire altar excuse me put
[1:15:38] it in his hands come laid Isaiah's head
[1:15:42] back and touched his lips and said your
[1:15:44] iniquity is gone amen then Isaiah
[1:15:47] learned another lesson I might drop this
[1:15:49] in might not be very appropriate but I
[1:15:52] believe it is did you notice God
[1:15:54] cleanses his Prophet by fire not by
[1:15:57] theology or books of some kind see he
[1:16:01] cleanses his people by fire Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] and Fire not by Declaration of Creeds or
[1:16:08] books or something you got to learn a
[1:16:10] bunch of prayers and so forth he cleans
[1:16:13] cleans them by fire off of the altar
[1:16:16] that's how he set his him in order yeah
[1:16:20] yes sir that's how he cleansed His
[1:16:21] prophets at the beginning when the 120
[1:16:24] was in the watch that's how he cleansed
[1:16:26] His prophets at the beginning when 120
[1:16:29] was in an upper room the Holy Spirit
[1:16:31] fell and tongues of fire set upon
[1:16:34] them you ever thought about Isaiah and
[1:16:36] the burning the temple and Sim sir
[1:16:40] amen they were cleansed and ready for
[1:16:42] service that's how God cleanses not by
[1:16:45] learning get a Bachelor of art or a DD
[1:16:49] PhD but getting holy fire from heaven
[1:16:52] that takes the lying off of your lips
[1:16:55] and takes the carnality out of you Burns
[1:16:58] that stuff away that draws of the world
[1:17:01] and puts his presence in there and lives
[1:17:03] through that whole that person Holy Fire
[1:17:06] is what God cleanses his church with
[1:17:08] Isaiah learned that he ought we ought to
[1:17:10] learn it that God don't cleanse by
[1:17:12] knowledge he cleansed by
[1:17:15] fire okay let me
[1:17:22] get
[1:17:23] we got two more influence 1963
[1:17:27] 11:30 the be is in other words another
[1:17:31] service he's talking about how he goes
[1:17:33] down to the temple notice the Heavenly
[1:17:34] seraphim as they flew through the temple
[1:17:36] now seraphim is a it is a mighty word
[1:17:40] there it's not an angel but it's what is
[1:17:43] it what it is it's a burning sacrifice
[1:17:47] burning he has something to do with the
[1:17:49] atonement because he offers a sacrifice
[1:17:52] to make a way for the repentant sinner
[1:17:54] to the throne of Mercy what a position
[1:17:57] higher than an angel greater than an
[1:17:59] angel for the angel stand back but the
[1:18:02] seraphim goes forward with the offering
[1:18:04] right in the presence of God a burner of
[1:18:07] the offering of the prayer that's been
[1:18:08] made the burner of the
[1:18:11] sacrifice like I said
[1:18:14] Jacob what' you
[1:18:16] see Angels ascending right
[1:18:21] descending what happen to
[1:18:25] uh what it come on mind the house of
[1:18:31] canas you read your
[1:18:35] Bible it says your
[1:18:39] arms that's right your prayers yep your
[1:18:45] Deeds your doings has come up before
[1:18:51] God the sacrif ice burner was taken care
[1:18:55] of he said now I've sent a
[1:18:58] man to tell you the rest of the story
[1:19:02] right because this message is so
[1:19:04] important I can't trust it with an
[1:19:07] angel the angel might be able to keep me
[1:19:10] clean but he can't bring me the
[1:19:12] message the holy spirit will do that but
[1:19:15] it can only come through the body of
[1:19:17] Christ
[1:19:18] amen so he says Peter you go down there
[1:19:21] now to con the house of
[1:19:24] Kus y he said I'm not
[1:19:27] going that's a
[1:19:30] gentile don't send me down
[1:19:33] there he said don't you call unclean
[1:19:36] what I've cleansed now I quoting the
[1:19:40] scripture he said you go Peter Y and

[1:19:55] the sacrifice burner has done his
[1:19:58] job now you go
[1:20:01] amen and you open the
[1:20:05] door Harvest Time 1964 1212 we'll try to
[1:20:09] get to in a
[1:20:10] quip the Potter is Roman 8 tells us who
[1:20:13] can tell the Potter can the clay say
[1:20:16] make me thus thus see no God has to
[1:20:18] display all his attributes and so he has
[1:20:21] to make a vessel of dishonor and the
[1:20:24] other one to honor to show that that one
[1:20:28] up of the course but he's Sovereign you
[1:20:30] see nobody can tell him what to do he
[1:20:33] makes us different even to that that
[1:20:36] we're told in the Bible that the star
[1:20:38] Stars differ one from another one star
[1:20:41] differs from another you know there's a
[1:20:43] difference in heaven and
[1:20:49] angels there's a difference in heaven
[1:20:52] remember the word of over while ago it
[1:20:53] was in degrees there's difference in
[1:20:56] heaven in angels Angelic beings there is
[1:21:01] Angels there is Chim
[1:21:05] chims there is
[1:21:07] Sims and there there there difference
[1:21:11] there and we're all
[1:21:14] different there's a difference in
[1:21:17] them I want to read this last one but
[1:21:19] I'm not going to say any more about
[1:21:21] it 29 97 Church age book yes there he
[1:21:26] stands the Lord Of Glory once as the
[1:21:29] father he was surrounded by the Angels
[1:21:31] the archangels the
[1:21:33] cherubims the the archangels the
[1:21:35] cherubims and Sims and the whole host of
[1:21:38] Heaven crying holy
[1:21:41] holy we got to cover the archangels now
[1:21:45] that we don't have time
[1:21:47] tonight we'll get into that the Lord
[1:21:49] willing
[1:21:50] Sunday archangels
[1:21:56] you see what I'm trying to say
[1:22:00] though there's
[1:22:05] Angels they're just right around us
[1:22:07] right with us all the time they don't
[1:22:09] leave
[1:22:11] us we read from the prophet they don't
[1:22:13] leave
[1:22:15] us and we don't just look at it well
[1:22:17] well brother Dale I finally got it but
[1:22:19] after you preaching for quite a while
[1:22:21] now I got it down to where I could at
[1:22:22] least see one
[1:22:23] Angel and now you come out and talk
[1:22:25] about millions of them well what do you
[1:22:29] have de
[1:22:32] of there's an angel designed for that
[1:22:35] purpose that's
[1:22:39] right I wish you'd read these over and
[1:22:41] over especially about the
[1:22:43] burners and then think in your mind
[1:22:45] about what's in the Bible you know like
[1:22:47] the scriptures I gave you
[1:22:50] know look in Daniel and see how that
[1:22:54] Daniel was out
[1:22:55] there and God came to
[1:22:58] it cuz somebody made him clean Isaiah
[1:23:02] somebody made him
[1:23:05] clean somebody come down on the day of
[1:23:07] Pentecost and
[1:23:09] the tongues of
[1:23:13] fire well I thought it just a little
[1:23:16] liing
[1:23:17] through it must have been something
[1:23:19] enough to burn them
[1:23:20] out cuz the Holy Ghost to come in yeah
[1:23:24] but what if they hadn't been the burning
[1:23:25] out first see that's what we want to
[1:23:28] make it we want to make the tongue that
[1:23:30] come down the speaking the Pentecost
[1:23:32] will do that and they make it speaking
[1:23:35] in tongues as the Holy
[1:23:37] Ghost and we go another step upward and
[1:23:40] we talk about well it just a tongue that
[1:23:43] come down and just lck on
[1:23:45] and that was only making way for the
[1:23:48] Holy Ghost to come on down into the
[1:23:51] person right sure
[1:23:54] amen had the spirit and the body not
[1:23:58] been made right the Holy Ghost would
[1:24:01] have never fell into the heart
[1:24:04] right the tongues of fire came to burn
[1:24:08] out everything that's why we'll realize
[1:24:10] one of these days why the bible say that
[1:24:12] it's the Holy Ghost and Fire it doesn't
[1:24:16] say fire and Holy Ghost that's not
[1:24:19] scripture it's the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:24:24] because that Holy Ghost is a fire to
[1:24:26] burn out everything the prophet said
[1:24:29] that's left of you and I right to where
[1:24:32] God can come and live into our heart by
[1:24:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the
[1:24:37] burner to make the worshipper
[1:24:41] clean well I I thought once we got I
[1:24:44] thought all that sacrifice and all that
[1:24:45] stuff was back in the Old
[1:24:48] Testament well I thought we were
[1:24:49] supposed to be a Living Sacrifice right
[1:24:52] amen I thought we were supposed to
[1:24:54] present ourselves a Living Sacrifice
[1:24:57] holy and acceptable unto
[1:24:59] God like I said maybe that's why we
[1:25:01] don't see
[1:25:06] Angels right is because we're not
[1:25:09] presenting ourselves in the right
[1:25:14] way maybe that's why we're not
[1:25:16] Christians because the Holy Ghost can't
[1:25:18] burn out what's in
[1:25:21] US
[1:25:25] he said well brother Dale I've seen you
[1:25:26] have
[1:25:30] problems we're going to have them to we
[1:25:32] get out of here folks whether you
[1:25:35] believe it or
[1:25:36] not and it's not going to be our
[1:25:39] righteousness or our Holiness or our
[1:25:41] doings that makes God fulfill his word
[1:25:44] he's going to do it because he promised
[1:25:46] it amen
[1:25:48] amen the Holy Ghost didn't come in the
[1:25:51] upper room room because them people were
[1:25:53] so holy in P was what they had was there
[1:25:57] that the Holy Ghost had to make it to
[1:25:59] the burner yes sir but they wasn't
[1:26:04] right that's right God promised it when
[1:26:08] the day of Pentecost was fully come it
[1:26:11] was a promise yes the prophet said he's
[1:26:15] not going to send the headstone upon our
[1:26:16] marriage right he said he's going to
[1:26:18] send it because he promised it right
[1:26:22] well you know
[1:26:24] what you may think I'm so carnal as can
[1:26:27] be but you know what that's going to
[1:26:28] mean that's going to mean that our
[1:26:30] burners our Angels our seraphim is
[1:26:33] really going to have to be at work in
[1:26:34] the end
[1:26:36] time that's right to make up people that
[1:26:39] could be even Pro even nowhere
[1:26:42] worthy but he's going to do it right and
[1:26:46] he may have to burn us out real
[1:26:49] good with that Holy Ghost in fire come
[1:26:52] on
[1:26:54] Brothers I hope you understand I'm not
[1:26:56] just talking about some kind of Angel
[1:26:58] something I'm trying to get you to see
