[2:58] there a few minutes ago where brother
[3:01] Dale said about the where we don't need
[3:03] manifested sons in the Millennium my
[3:04] brother Branham came upon that in the
[3:07] 50s where they were talking about having
[3:09] no millennium and where we are where we
[3:11] needed divine healing in the millennium
[3:14] and all these things in the millennium
[3:15] and even that brother earned Baxter
[3:17] didn't believe in the millennium I don't
[3:19] know if he turned around and started
[3:20] believing but brother Bramson even
[3:22] brother earned Baxter doesn't believe in
[3:23] the millennium he said well I believe in
[3:25] millennium he said but why do we need
[3:27] healing in the millennium he said we'll
[3:30] be in glorified bodies so we need it now
[3:34] we need to speaking of the word now
[3:36] that's what's gonna get us to the
[3:39] Millennium hey man we're not gonna get
[3:42] to the millennium unless we start unless
[3:44] the words being spoken through the mouth
[3:46] of the endtime bride so you got your

[7:02] name Amen
[7:04] today we're going to speak just for a
[7:06] moment on three periods of time but
[7:08] we're going to get to that in just a
[7:10] minute Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are
[7:13] determined upon thy city upon thy people
[7:16] and upon thy holy city to do what six
[7:19] things we've been talking about to
[7:20] finish the transgression to make an end
[7:22] of sins to make reconciliation for
[7:24] iniquity bringing everlasting
[7:26] righteousness seal up the vision and
[7:28] prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[7:30] now that's all of Daniels seventy weeks
[7:33] that's it that's it that's it in a
[7:37] nutshell that's what we've been talking
[7:39] about for you know five services that is
[7:43] the seventy weeks of Daniel seventy
[7:45] weeks are determined upon the people in
[7:47] the city to do these six things to get
[7:50] us into the Millennium alright but now
[7:53] we God thought so much of us and Daniel
[7:58] he sent Gabriel to tell us how it was
[8:01] gonna happen so know therefore and
[8:03] understand that from the going forth of
[8:05] the commandment to restore and build
[8:07] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[8:10] shall be seven weeks and threescore in
[8:12] two weeks the street shall be built
[8:14] again in the wall even in troublous
[8:16] times and after threescore and two weeks
[8:19] shall Messiah be cut off but not for
[8:21] himself and the people of the prince
[8:23] that shall come shall destroy the city
[8:24] and the sanctuary and the end thereof
[8:27] shall be with a flood and to the end
[8:29] unto the end of the war desolations are
[8:31] determined verse 27 and he shall confirm
[8:34] the covenant with many for one week and
[8:36] in the midst of the week he shall cause
[8:38] the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
[8:40] and for the overspreading of
[8:42] abominations he shall make it desolate
[8:44] even until the consummation and that
[8:46] determined shall be poured out upon the
[8:51] desolate you may be seated in the Lord
[8:52] at his blessing to the reading of the
[8:55] word we're going to go back over
[9:02] I erased all this off so I hope you
[9:12] remember what I wrote down but we're
[9:15] going to we're going to kind of break it
[9:18] down just a little bit more and if it's
[9:25] if you have any questions feel free to
[9:28] ask but don't ask about something we
[9:32] fixing to talk about asking buy
[9:33] something we already talked about
[9:36] because we're fixing to get into the
[9:39] days and the times with everybody have
[9:41] the chart with them today the big chart
[9:43] the one that brother branham everybody
[9:45] got it close by where you can see it I
[9:48] keep one in my Bible all the time that's
[9:52] this one this chart here the one that
[9:55] gave everybody this is the one that
[9:57] brother Branham drew on the 70th week of
[10:01] Daniel that's the chart he drew like I
[10:04] said before we showed this to brother
[10:06] George Smith and he said that is
[10:09] definitely Rebecca did this she took it
[10:12] off of the chalkboard and put it on this
[10:14] piece of paper for brother Branham so
[10:17] this is that's not hearsay that's not
[10:21] what somebody else drew this is exactly
[10:23] what brother Branham drew on the day he
[10:25] preached the 70th week of Daniel which
[10:29] was the last of the three-part series
[10:32] the first one was Gabriel's instructions
[10:34] then the six fold purpose and then the
[10:36] 70th week so if you would let's read the
[10:39] I like to read that in second chronicles
[10:42] because what it does it gives you an
[10:44] idea that God has already spoke to
[10:48] somebody about what's going to happen so
[10:51] let's go to 2nd chronicles 36 so
[10:54] therefore he brought upon them the king
[10:56] of the Chaldees who slew their young men
[10:59] with the sword in the house of their
[11:00] sanctuary and had no compassion upon
[11:02] young men are made an old man or him
[11:04] that stoop for age he gave them all into
[11:07] his hand now remember this is back in
[11:10] the history just for a minute remember
[11:12] Israel turned God down started
[11:14] worshipping idols
[11:16] started throwing their kids in the fire
[11:19] them the mole out they just did all kind
[11:22] of they did they did nothing God said to
[11:24] do and everything he said not to do so
[11:27] God had to divorce him and put him away
[11:29] couldn't forget him though but he
[11:32] divorced them and put him away they lost
[11:34] a position in God and all the best of
[11:38] the house of God great and small in the
[11:39] treasures of the house of the Lord and
[11:41] the treasures of the King and all of his
[11:42] princes and all these he brought to
[11:45] Babylon and they burnt the house of God
[11:47] and break down the wall of Jerusalem
[11:49] because remember the walls got to be
[11:51] built back according to Daniel 9:25 and
[11:54] all these and destroyed all the goodly
[11:58] vessels thereof and then they had
[12:00] escaped from the sword carried he away
[12:01] to Babylon where they were servants to
[12:03] him and his sons until the reign of the
[12:06] king of Persia because we're going to
[12:07] talk next time we speak we're going to
[12:10] go back to where Cyrus is going to give
[12:13] us because remember Israel couldn't do
[12:16] anything because they were under the
[12:18] reign of the kings they were under
[12:21] Nebuchadnezzar then they were under his
[12:23] son
[12:24] Belshazzar and then they were under
[12:26] these different ones but when it comes
[12:29] to the king of Persia or the Chaldees
[12:32] you see Cyrus and Cyrus is the one
[12:35] that's going to actually give them a
[12:37] proclamation to be able to build
[12:38] everything back so we'll see that later
[12:41] not right now but this is kind of what
[12:43] he's talking about and then he carried
[12:46] away the sortie to Babylon where they
[12:47] were servants to him and his sons until
[12:49] the reign of the kingdom of Persia to
[12:52] fulfill the word of the Lord by the
[12:53] mouth of jeremiah until the land had
[12:56] enjoyed her Sabbath's where as long as
[12:58] she laid desolate she kept Sabbath to
[13:00] fulfil in other words 70 years God was
[13:03] going to make sure that 70 years through
[13:05] Jeremiah and during that time it was the
[13:08] captivity that Daniel got caught up in
[13:10] and remember when Daniel is writing this
[13:13] the Book of Daniel was written Daniel
[13:16] was not in Jerusalem all right the the
[13:20] goings on and the happenings was what
[13:22] happened inside that captivity but
[13:24] Daniel said okay Lord I've got I know
[13:26] I've been here sixty-eight years I got
[13:28] two more years left
[13:29] what are you
[13:30] what's going to happen same way with us
[13:32] what's going to happen Lord so God sent
[13:35] us a prophet
[13:36] he sends Gabriel to Daniel to show him
[13:40] what's going to happen all the way to
[13:42] the Millennium not just what's going to
[13:44] happen when they get out of captivity
[13:46] because when they got our captivity
[13:48] things happen that God said was going to
[13:49] happen but God showed him all the way
[13:51] till now right now at this time we're
[13:53] we're talking about now all the way into
[13:56] the great millennial reign because
[13:58] that's what the Jews are looking for see
[14:00] the Jews are not promised in new city
[14:04] Jews are not promised in new city that's
[14:06] the price
[14:07] we're promised a new city because we're
[14:10] the bride but they are promised a time
[14:15] they're promised of time that they're
[14:17] going to rest for a thousand years
[14:19] they're going to have a thousand years
[14:22] where Jesus Christ is going to rule and
[14:24] reign on the throne as the son of David
[14:26] to fulfill Scripture judging and ruling
[14:30] the twelve tribes of Israel which twelve
[14:32] times 12 is 144 that's going to be a
[14:37] hundred and twelve thousand from each
[14:38] tribe that's 144,000 it's going to be in
[14:42] that millennium that's why I'm telling
[14:43] you this you got to have the people and
[14:46] the city the people and the city you
[14:50] can't just put the people in you got to
[14:53] get the city bill you got to get the you
[14:55] got to get the they built it up here
[14:58] we'll see that in just a second we run
[15:01] through it real quick and then what
[15:03] they're done is is there gonna be a
[15:05] millenium that they're gonna build a
[15:06] Millennial temple and they're gonna live
[15:08] in the Millennial tent well they're
[15:09] gonna live in a thousand years they're
[15:11] gonna build houses but it's going to be
[15:12] a central thing called a temple that the
[15:15] Ezekiel 40 through 44 is the Millennial
[15:19] temple that God said Israel was going to
[15:21] build and that the prophet of God many
[15:24] many times we've read it several times
[15:25] before that they are going to build that
[15:28] city and the anointing to the city we'll
[15:31] see in just a minute as we'll read it
[15:32] again is going to be when Christ comes
[15:35] out back in Revelations 19 21 and he's
[15:37] not coming back alone he's coming back
[15:40] with a bride
[15:41] and the bride the bride will be the
[15:45] anointing to the temple all right so
[15:47] that's something that you and I got to
[15:49] look forward to is that we're gonna sit
[15:51] there with him it's not going to be him
[15:54] just sitting there by self he's gonna
[15:57] have a bride sitting there beside of him
[15:58] to rule and reign for a thousand years
[16:01] and like I said before you and I have
[16:03] you and I virtually have zero scripture
[16:05] to fulfill during that time our script
[16:08] is fulfilled in in and when we go in the
[16:11] rapture I mean what you say well what do
[16:14] we got well we got all we got some new
[16:15] CD coming that Scripture and you know
[16:18] what we don't fulfill that God's all
[16:20] right brother branham according to the
[16:21] future home he's already got it built
[16:22] for us it's just gonna come down out of
[16:24] heaven by your desire so you've already
[16:28] built it you're sitting here in it today
[16:31] you have your own house right there
[16:34] that's the house God wanted you to live
[16:36] in amen because John saw the city coming
[16:40] down as it looked like a what a bride
[16:42] adorned for a husband all right so
[16:45] that's what we've got to look forward to
[16:47] so we've Ezekiel 42 44 and and you know
[16:51] I was thinking this morning when brother
[16:53] Dale was time about the law the law is
[16:55] never done away with if you do the way
[16:56] with the law then you got to take the
[16:58] Old Testament and throw it out
[16:59] so Ezekiel goes throw it out with it so
[17:02] there's no Millennial temple announced
[17:04] if you throw it all that out that all
[17:06] comes down listen Moses is going to be
[17:08] there now all the different ones they
[17:10] we're not gonna do away with it
[17:12] but we are going to be able maybe to
[17:16] explain to them what they tried to
[17:19] explain without the baptism of the holy
[17:22] ghost in their soul they would have an
[17:24] anointing come on him and Isaiah would
[17:26] preach 66 books of the Bible but now I
[17:29] don't think he understood it all he was
[17:31] just prophesying he was he was writing
[17:34] down what he saw now listen you and I
[17:37] are living what they saw we're not we're
[17:40] not prophesying anymore as we were
[17:42] talking this morning in the Sunday
[17:43] School class we're not we're not
[17:45] prophesying anymore where we're living
[17:48] the actual prophesy amen because if we
[17:51] if we prophesied that something else is
[17:54] coming then you and I
[17:56] pass away and let that come up you got
[18:00] that if we're prophesying all there's a
[18:03] group that groups here we are that group
[18:08] we are the prophesy brother Brown said
[18:10] we are a prophetic group of people we
[18:13] have prophetic insight that means that
[18:16] God can speak to us in a way that he's
[18:18] never spoke to anybody else and you and
[18:22] I can understand more than anybody has
[18:24] ever been able to understand on the face
[18:27] of this earth everybody got that right
[18:30] now today we can understand more even
[18:34] more than the Apostle Paul oh you get
[18:38] quiet Paul didn't know a thing about a
[18:41] seal Paul died before the seals were
[18:43] even talked about but he but when we
[18:46] refer to the seals we refer back to what
[18:49] Paul said see so he was prophesying
[18:51] about something he didn't even see now
[18:54] he said I could look through a glass
[18:55] darkly what reason I'm saying this
[18:57] Daniel Daniel was sitting there wanting
[18:59] to know what was going on in two years
[19:01] Gabriel give him the whole thing to the
[19:04] to the Millennium but now he didn't draw
[19:06] him a chart because he tells Daniel in
[19:09] Daniel 12 he says Daniel Daniel ass I
[19:12] like Daniel because he asked a lot of
[19:13] questions
[19:14] he said when do these things be in the
[19:16] and the angel told him said Daniel it's
[19:19] not for you you need to go on as you are
[19:23] that sound familiar brother Branham on
[19:26] this illness questions and answers on
[19:28] the sales he said it's not for you it's
[19:31] gone from you in other words it's sealed
[19:33] up to the time of the end
[19:36] fifty years later has to be opened up to
[19:39] a group of people Daniel it's going to
[19:42] be sealed up until the time of the end
[19:45] where you're going to just go stand with
[19:47] your people and then I'm gonna come on
[19:50] the day of Pentecost and I'm going to
[19:51] enter into a group of people then we're
[19:54] gonna live through 2,000 years of church
[19:55] ages I'm gonna send a prophet in the
[19:58] very last one and his his name's Elijah
[20:01] he's gonna have the spirit of Elijah
[20:04] Daniel didn't know much about Elijah but
[20:07] he's going to the spirit of Elijah and
[20:08] he's going
[20:09] tell all this you saw Daniel all the way
[20:13] through he's going to tell you about the
[20:14] the kingdoms and all these different
[20:16] things that's coming to pass and then
[20:18] he's going to take and he's gonna put it
[20:20] up on a board and he's going to show the
[20:23] whole all the way to the consummation
[20:24] this prophet in the end time he's going
[20:27] to draw this chart and he's going to
[20:29] show exactly what's gonna happen
[20:31] but Daniel you just hang on in the
[20:36] Millennium somebody be able to explain
[20:38] him so don't worry about Daniel in other
[20:43] words listen it wasn't for him he'd gone
[20:46] from him he knew the visions and that's
[20:48] what I'm telling you now Lee the people
[20:50] that live in there as I read that quote
[20:53] during the seals you know there's you
[20:55] got a box and our boxes our boxes stood
[20:58] to take the forward the full word was
[21:02] with no discrepancy the full word with
[21:06] you say can you preach a perfect word
[21:09] well Jesus did didn't he and he was the
[21:14] word the Word was made flesh now the
[21:17] words been made fleshing in different
[21:20] Jesus same Jesus Paul said behind the
[21:25] mind of Christ and to have the mind of
[21:27] Christ as the things think the thoughts
[21:28] of Christ and as you think the thoughts
[21:30] of Christ that brings what Christ in you
[21:34] the hope of glory and Christ if you'll
[21:37] let him if you'll lean toward him and
[21:39] not your own understanding you'll let
[21:41] him talk through you and you know what
[21:44] it'll be the same perfect word he spoke
[21:46] 2,000 years ago
[21:48] it'll have to be if it's the same Jesus
[21:50] now if it's a different one and man
[21:52] connects their ideas to it then it's a
[21:54] little bit different that's what's been
[21:56] happening with this 70 weeks of Daniel
[21:58] man has stuck their ideas in it all the
[22:00] way down through the ages and then
[22:02] brother Branham comes up and we're not
[22:04] going to read it today but I'm compiling
[22:07] the quotes in the 70 weeks of Daniel how
[22:11] positive he was thus that the Lord this
[22:15] has got to be done we've got to do this
[22:17] you've got to take this chart and write
[22:20] it down and copy it down and and
[22:23] study it you know he wasn't worried just
[22:25] a trunk a diner 70 weeks we'll just go
[22:27] through that because it's in the Bible
[22:28] no there was a purpose because without
[22:31] understanding the the great secret of
[22:33] Daniel 7 to ition our gonna understand
[22:35] the seals so and that's according to
[22:37] what he said not what I said all right
[22:39] so if you don't understand Daniel 70
[22:41] weeks you can't understand the seals and
[22:43] you can't take a body change just wet is
[22:46] so maybe by the Lord's help we'll try to
[22:48] get this to where you can understand I
[22:51] know we've got new ones that's come in
[22:53] later you know but brother Dale has been
[22:55] preaching this since 1974 so it's it's
[22:57] just about I don't think you can ever
[23:00] wear the Word of God out but you can go
[23:04] over it so many times you think man I
[23:05] hope they get it this time and of course
[23:09] that's a schoolteacher and I'll tell you
[23:10] you know you you keep on and keep on you
[23:13] keep on and then you got to keep on then
[23:16] you got just keep holding these got to
[23:18] keep on we don't want to leave nobody
[23:20] behind we want everybody I want
[23:23] everybody why in the world would you as
[23:24] a Christian would want to say well that
[23:26] person ain't gonna make it now grab a
[23:29] bottle ahead and pull them up take them
[23:31] with you get them to get them to believe
[23:35] the same words you believe that to me
[23:38] that's having faith in the Word of God
[23:39] alright let's read the first the first
[23:43] quote we we shouldn't be too much too
[23:47] much today Lewis gave us a little extra
[23:49] time I don't count that time now before
[23:51] between two and three that he gave to
[23:53] 2:00 and 2:30 if he'd given me 10
[23:55] minutes and we ain't counting that it's
[23:56] supposed to be 2:30 okay so anyway
[23:59] nobody agreed with that saying man
[24:01] yeah ah you heard what I said I thought
[24:06] I'd get a much amen all right the six
[24:10] fold purpose now what brother bran tell
[24:11] us seventy weeks are determined upon by
[24:13] people for what purpose for what whose
[24:15] people was it determined upon Daniel's
[24:17] people the Jew so this is to the Jews
[24:20] alone it what was it determined for upon
[24:24] not only Daniel but upon Daniel's holy
[24:27] city and as I said 15 times before this
[24:31] covers the people and the dwelling the
[24:35] people in the city the people in
[24:36] city if you don't get if you leave one
[24:39] out then you won't be able to understand
[24:42] the damage 70 weeks you got to take the
[24:44] people and the city because to us look
[24:47] to us the only city that's important is
[24:49] the future home alright well that's
[24:51] worth head down that's way down the road
[24:54] but to the Jews they want that temple
[24:57] hey listen they are today this day today
[25:00] trying to get that temple built the
[25:03] natural Orthodox Jews they don't believe
[25:06] Jesus came yet the Messiah they said you
[25:09] don't say Jesus but the Messiah came yet
[25:11] and they're trying to get these pieces
[25:13] together so that they can get the
[25:15] Messiah here they know he's supposed to
[25:17] come but remember they mixed him when he
[25:22] came but when he comes back through two
[25:25] prophets to the hundred forty four
[25:27] thousand they're gonna see that same
[25:29] Jesus and know that they had they're the
[25:31] ones that put him on the cross so this
[25:33] is to Daniel's people and the city
[25:36] everybody got that say man what is
[25:39] Daniel city Jerusalem so it's got to
[25:41] happen around Jerusalem it's what's
[25:44] gonna go on now alright number two real
[25:51] quick now now I want you to know friends
[25:53] striking on these things I'll certainly
[25:55] leave out weeks of teaching the kind of
[25:56] hitting this to the weather cools off
[25:58] later
[25:58] we get to the seven seals by all
[26:00] trumpets all these things I can refer
[26:03] back and say do you remember on the
[26:05] seventy weeks of Daniel do you remember
[26:06] the church ages when it went up and what
[26:09] taking place look and the seventy and
[26:12] what seventy weeks of Daniel covers from
[26:13] the going up of the church until the
[26:16] coming back of the church that space
[26:18] when it covers now not all seventy weeks
[26:20] of Daniel part of it talking about the
[26:22] redemption of the six fold purpose
[26:24] because remember that's the title of the
[26:27] for the quote comes from he's in the six
[26:29] fold purpose
[26:30] alright seventy weeks are determined now
[26:31] there was a six fold purpose to his
[26:33] visit telling him what was going to come
[26:35] to pass now there was a six fold purpose
[26:37] of its coming because remember he he he
[26:42] Christ at the end of the six fold
[26:44] purpose who shows up Christ in the bride
[26:47] all right
[26:48] now tonight I think
[26:50] leave off Scripture and let's going down
[26:52] to the red and seventy weeks are
[26:54] determined upon my people now remember
[26:56] that is all that the journey of Israel
[26:58] will have on this earth they are
[27:00] determined seventy weeks is just
[27:02] determined all right now seventy weeks
[27:05] is how long we'll go write it right here
[27:09] 490 years does everybody know how we got
[27:13] that seventy times seven if it's 70
[27:17] weeks and one week equals seven years
[27:20] seventy times seven is 490 years to
[27:25] redeem Israel everybody got that same
[27:29] man that would be seventy times seven
[27:34] one week equals seven years now we've
[27:38] already established that right all right
[27:41] because that's going to be important
[27:43] here in just a minute we're gonna get
[27:44] our our three time periods and then
[27:46] we'll then we'll stop now look they are
[27:50] determined just determined seven two
[27:52] weeks is just determined
[27:53] that's all that's lauded to the Jews
[27:56] upon thy people and upon thy holy city
[27:58] therefore this seventy weeks now don't
[28:00] miss it it will reveal from that time to
[28:03] the end of the Jews and also to the end
[28:06] of Jerusalem until there'll be a new
[28:08] city built
[28:09] so whatever the six-four purpose is will
[28:12] be the redemption of the Jews until the
[28:13] new city is built everybody got that
[28:15] pretty plain all right revelations 11:1
[28:19] says there was given to me a reed like
[28:21] unto a rod and the angel stood saying
[28:23] rise and measure the temple of God and
[28:25] the altar and them that worship therein
[28:27] but the court which is without the
[28:30] temple leave out and measure it not to
[28:32] see there's your building
[28:34] there's your temple but the court which
[28:40] is without the temple leave out and
[28:41] measure it not for it is given unto the
[28:43] Gentiles and the Holy City shall they
[28:46] tread under foot forty and two months
[28:49] now how long is forty two months three
[28:52] and a half years are twelve hundred and
[28:54] sixty days and I will give power unto my
[28:57] two witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[28:59] thousand two hundred threescore days
[29:02] clothed in
[29:04] Clau now we're going to have to bring
[29:06] something else in here want you to
[29:07] remember that we are not talking from
[29:10] this point forward we are not talking
[29:12] about our calendar our calendar is 365
[29:18] and 1/4 day called a Julian calendar
[29:22] because of Emperor Julian decided well
[29:27] what happened was real quick the reason
[29:30] we have quarter days the reason we do it
[29:32] the way you do it when they started way
[29:35] back when and brother Dale explained
[29:36] this a long time ago and I'll just kind
[29:38] of cover over you can look it up google
[29:39] it it's got to be right yeah I know but
[29:51] what happened was is they kept by the
[29:54] moon so it just kept going back into
[29:56] whatever century it was BC or ad or
[29:58] somewhere in there close what happened
[30:00] was this spring wasn't in April anymore
[30:05] it had begin losing or gaining so many
[30:08] days until spring was like in July or
[30:13] December
[30:14] so they set it back like so many years
[30:18] or so many months they did away with it
[30:20] and started it back said ok 365 and a
[30:22] quarter days because the earth is
[30:24] wobbling all you kids know that the
[30:26] earth is tilted to one side so many
[30:29] degrees and it's wobbles so it doesn't
[30:31] hit exactly on the what it's supposed to
[30:34] be a 360 days ok so that's the old
[30:40] Julian calendar but what we're going to
[30:42] talk about from now on will be will be
[30:44] brother branham called it a prophetic
[30:46] calendar of 360 days to a year they got
[30:54] that same in 30 days to a month now he's
[30:58] gonna I want to read that he's gonna hit
[31:00] it in just a minute but I'm gonna get
[31:02] you get ahead of a little bit because
[31:04] remember moon cycles your sisters know
[31:09] about cycles 28 to 30 day cycles you
[31:13] everybody got that
[31:13] so even brother Branson nature tells us
[31:15] that there's 30 days not 31
[31:18] 30-knot 28 or 29 like man saying but if
[31:21] you use the 360-day calendar that's why
[31:24] the bible says here they will prophesy
[31:28] 1003 score a thousand two hundred and
[31:32] threescore days which is twelve hundred
[31:34] and sixty days well now 1260 days is not
[31:38] three and a half years of our calendar
[31:40] but the Bible says that'll be four time
[31:43] times and the dividing of times that's
[31:45] three and a half so but three you take
[31:48] three and a half years 42 months
[31:49] according to the 30-day calendar and
[31:52] 1260 days it hits that exactly and even
[31:55] when we bring the dates in that's why
[31:57] everybody had it off they were using
[31:59] regular calendar days 365 and a quarter
[32:03] days
[32:03] well everything we're going to talk
[32:05] about now in Daniel 70 wheats comes from
[32:07] the prophetic calendar of 360 days to a
[32:10] year alright
[32:11] and I believe this is what I believe
[32:13] this is just my belief I think brother
[32:15] Branham made one comment and I've been
[32:16] looking at it for it because what
[32:19] happened was is when did it tilt it
[32:22] tilted at the flood and brother Brown
[32:25] said something a comment could have
[32:27] happened there in the flood you know you
[32:28] it wasn't 40 days of rain that's for
[32:31] sure 40 days rain didn't Phyllis world
[32:33] up
[32:34] the Bible says the Fountains of the deep
[32:36] opened up and you can see now where even
[32:37] brother Branham explains you know that's
[32:39] why the polar ice caps are in or in each
[32:42] pole because the gravity pulls them
[32:44] toward each pole all right there's no
[32:46] telling what's up there under these
[32:48] glaciers when they start melting they
[32:50] there's got to be civilizations and
[32:52] people and everything else because after
[32:53] the flood I believe that for it drew it
[32:55] out
[32:56] well what God's going to do is is this
[32:57] next atomic Armageddon
[33:01] I believe is gonna set it back up
[33:04] because no millennium it's not gonna be
[33:05] a thousand years of 365 and a quarter
[33:07] days we're going right back to this
[33:10] right here because it still is a day I
[33:12] mean you got time in the millennium now
[33:14] this is going to go away at the future
[33:16] home amen
[33:19] but it's not going to millennium we're
[33:21] gonna live 1,000 year millennium
[33:23] according to 360 days not 365 and a
[33:26] quarter okay but as we do that you got
[33:29] to bring the earth back up right
[33:30] to have that so that's just my thought
[33:33] is the man I believe is one that knocked
[33:37] it out of cater and man ones gonna put
[33:38] it back up you know so alright everybody
[33:41] got that then we've got four hundred
[33:43] ninety years seventy times seven one
[33:46] week equal seven years and then three
[33:48] hundred and sixty days are two a year
[33:52] there year the year that we'll talk
[33:54] about that on the Daniel seventy weeks
[33:55] everybody got that same an all right
[33:58] three hundred sixty days so don't get
[34:00] confused and try to figure it out with
[34:02] three hundred sixty five and a quarter
[34:05] and brother Brown explains that we'll
[34:07] bring it in but I'm just gonna try to
[34:08] hit the hit the highlights because we're
[34:11] not gonna be here next Sunday if we give
[34:13] you time to either forget everything I
[34:14] just said or give you time to study a
[34:18] little bit what I just say we is one
[34:20] either way all right so let's look here
[34:21] at the we know what happened in this in
[34:24] the six full purpose we've been through
[34:26] it five different services that there
[34:28] were six things that God was going to do
[34:30] to bring back Israel and bring back the
[34:33] cities everybody got that same am
[34:35] alright so we're going then where we're
[34:37] going we know for sure that when these
[34:39] two witnesses when they prophesy they
[34:42] are going to preach salvation to those
[34:45] 144,000 so those 144,000 are going to be
[34:49] redeemed they're going to be justified
[34:53] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[34:55] Ghost amen
[34:56] they're going to be 144,000 Holy Ghost
[34:59] filled individuals and they are going to
[35:03] do whatever they do for that three and a
[35:06] half year time under justification
[35:08] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[35:09] Ghost through those two prophets now
[35:12] there's not anything else to come
[35:14] there's not another message to prophets
[35:16] for 1260 days everybody got that
[35:19] amen everybody's got that 1260 days
[35:22] that's that's the time determined to get
[35:25] the people ready everybody got that time
[35:29] and the people ready not the city the
[35:33] people alright so the three things that
[35:35] happen if you pull them up one is to
[35:38] finish the transgression two is to make
[35:40] an end of sins three is to make
[35:43] reconciliation for a nickel
[35:44] now that is for the people because you
[35:48] don't save houses people get saved
[35:52] houses don't get saved people get saved
[35:57] the the temple didn't transgress and
[36:00] temple didn't have sins and the temple
[36:02] didn't have iniquity so that's got to be
[36:05] the people that were in there all right
[36:07] those people are the ones that
[36:08] transgressed now God had to hook he
[36:11] hooks the temple in because he's told
[36:13] them he even told him he said hey if
[36:16] you're in trouble look toward the temple
[36:19] and pray and I'll meet your need
[36:22] what did Jonah do I was reading it
[36:24] yesterday a couple days ago Jonah in the
[36:26] belly of the whale by spiritual
[36:29] revelation because he was in a dark
[36:31] place he turned and he remembered what
[36:35] they said to do he turned toward the
[36:37] city and prayed and then what happened
[36:40] the thing puked him out on the on the on
[36:44] the beach and he went in and preach
[36:46] salvation to Nineveh and the whole city
[36:48] got safe alright but he turned toward
[36:51] that so that's God said okay now bride
[36:54] bride
[36:55] you have no continuing City you have no
[36:58] certain place brother Brown said we
[37:00] don't have a certain day we don't have a
[37:02] certain temple we got to go to you are
[37:04] the temple but they have a certain
[37:06] temple because you can't take away all
[37:08] that God said about the temple in the
[37:10] Old Testament why do you think they're
[37:17] trying to build that temple for because
[37:19] they want to what restore they know that
[37:21] the restoration of Jerusalem in part has
[37:24] to happen with that temple that temples
[37:28] got to be in place all right there may
[37:30] okay with that so finish the
[37:31] transgression make an end of sin make
[37:33] reconciliation for iniquity for the
[37:35] people all right now let's read number
[37:37] three real quick because what's going to
[37:41] happen is is remember as we were talking
[37:43] last week a couple weeks ago Wednesday
[37:46] night about the Battle of Armageddon
[37:47] that Battle of Armageddon takes place in
[37:51] the midst of that last week and we'll
[37:53] put it back up on the chart in a minute
[37:56] go right here victory day we've had many
[38:01] great battle spiritual battle with many
[38:03] great be days the churches had I mean
[38:05] the church the body of Christ I'm not
[38:06] talking about the organization I'm
[38:08] talking about the body of Christ the
[38:09] body of believers down through the ages
[38:11] has had many victory day or be days we
[38:14] talked about we've had several you wars
[38:16] the wars and rumors of wars and be days
[38:18] and be days and be days
[38:19] it finally winds up into the great
[38:21] battle of Armageddon that'll be the last
[38:23] of it when she comes to the Battle of
[38:25] Armageddon that'll settle the whole
[38:27] thing just before the great millennium
[38:30] our mageddon is to clean off the earth
[38:33] now remember we're at word we just got
[38:36] three of the six fold finish finish the
[38:39] transgression make an end of sin mate
[38:41] reconciliation for iniquity we still got
[38:43] three more to go
[38:44] and you can't bring them in before the
[38:47] Battle of Armageddon how can you do that
[38:50] you can't how you gonna bring you in
[38:52] everlasting righteousness and then blow
[38:53] the whole world up all right if I okay
[38:57] with that we're gonna go Bible Bible
[39:00] just before the great millennium
[39:03] Armageddon is to clean off the earth
[39:05] shiri purifies herself with this atomic
[39:09] blowing so it's going to be in a calming
[39:11] battle and the volcanic ash and thing
[39:14] sinks this soap blood of men and upon
[39:16] the earth and sin and crime she sinks
[39:19] beneath the earth the volcanic Braves
[39:22] out again and renews and cleans the
[39:24] earth for the great millennium he cleans
[39:27] his church during that time for a people
[39:30] to live here alright there's coming the
[39:33] time that'll be great so at the Battle
[39:35] of Armageddon it's a not a spiritual
[39:38] battle this is physical men blowing each
[39:41] other up godless men there's nobody here
[39:44] with the new birth there's nobody here
[39:46] in the bride there's nobody here 144,000
[39:49] there's nobody here that is of God
[39:52] nobody and that's why that this is not
[39:55] just a small piece of a tribulation that
[39:59] was that's what's gonna happen when we
[40:01] leave Jacob's trouble or a small part of
[40:05] the battle before the Battle of
[40:07] Armageddon but the Battle of Armageddon
[40:08] is going to be
[40:09] a godless battle it's going to be a
[40:11] battle that well there's never been a
[40:14] battle since and there's never gonna be
[40:15] about laughter words all right because
[40:17] the next by the next great battle I read
[40:19] it to you last week the next great
[40:21] battle is a battle of Gog and Magog
[40:22] which is way over here on the other end
[40:24] of the millennium and that's God's fire
[40:26] that's God blowing up sold battle
[40:30] Armageddon doesn't kill a soul it just
[40:31] killed people human people the soul goes
[40:34] down into the fifth dimension and it has
[40:36] to lay there because the Bible says woe
[40:39] to them that don't receive in other
[40:40] words don't receive the the word of God
[40:43] because they have to go and live a
[40:45] thousand years or you know they're in
[40:47] that dimension for a thousand years and
[40:50] have to come up in the resurrection over
[40:51] here alright so the Battle of Armageddon
[40:53] is one battle the Battle of Gog and
[40:56] Magog is another battle two totally
[40:57] separate battles all right number four
[41:00] questions and answers the church age
[41:03] ending and has blacked out the bride is
[41:06] called we have already entered in
[41:07] Tribulation Period now that's a question
[41:09] somebody asked no no no I wish that I
[41:13] could just have more time on that the
[41:15] bride when she's taken from the church
[41:17] then the church age will cease Laodicea
[41:20] goes into chaos the bride goes to glory
[41:23] the Tribulation Period sets in upon the
[41:26] sleeping virgin for three and a half
[41:28] years or 1260 days while Israel is
[41:32] getting its prophecy then tribulation
[41:36] excuse me
[41:37] then tribulation sets in upon Israel why
[41:41] because after the 1260 days the two
[41:44] prophets are killed in 144,000 are being
[41:46] killed right all right and then comes
[41:49] the Battle of Armageddon which destroys
[41:51] all things and then the bride returns
[41:54] back with the groom for a thousand years
[41:56] the millennial reign millennium reign
[41:58] after that comes the white throne after
[42:01] that comes a new heaven yes we're over
[42:02] here and the new city coming down from
[42:05] God out of heaven eternity in time
[42:07] blends together but you got to remember
[42:09] we've still got three more because that
[42:12] six fold purpose has got to be inside
[42:14] them 490 years amen seventy times seven
[42:20] seventy weeks of Daniel finishes all
[42:22] these things
[42:23] and then according to Bible that's 490
[42:26] years it's gonna take 490 years for that
[42:28] to happen now we're gonna get into dates
[42:30] like I said the next time we talk about
[42:31] it but today I just want to make sure we
[42:35] know 490 years is seventy times seven
[42:37] one week equals seven years and 360 days
[42:40] to a year is our prophetic calendar that
[42:42] we're going to use now let's go we got
[42:46] to look and see number four five and six
[42:49] before is to bring in everlasting
[42:51] righteousness now how it like I said in
[42:53] the order they're in how are you going
[42:55] to you can't do that outside of the
[42:57] seventy weeks of Daniel it's got to be
[43:00] inside of the 490 years amen got to be
[43:04] inside of 490 years but now remember the
[43:07] Battle of Armageddon happens in the
[43:09] midst of the week then there's three
[43:11] other things that's got to happen to
[43:13] bring in everlasting righteousness why
[43:16] after all this has been wiped off after
[43:19] all the Armageddon every everything's
[43:22] been wiped off God brings in everlasting
[43:24] righteousness seals up the vision and
[43:26] prophecy puts it in a hundred forty-four
[43:28] thousand because they've got a vision
[43:30] and a prophecy to fulfil because they
[43:31] got to come back and build a temple and
[43:33] then to anoint the most holy now let's
[43:35] see what brother Branham says about this
[43:37] I didn't read this the other day but
[43:39] what's this number five this is in the
[43:41] 70th week of Daniel the prophet of God
[43:44] tells us that now the six fold purpose
[43:47] and we find out that on this sixth
[43:49] purpose to anoint the most holy we find
[43:52] out that most holy always represented
[43:56] the church the tabernacle and the last
[43:59] thing was to be done was to anoint the
[44:01] most holy
[44:02] that's the Millennial tabernacle that
[44:05] he'll live in during the millennial that
[44:07] will live in that will live in who's
[44:13] will we always him and us yeah we will
[44:19] left it who's the we will it's us were
[44:21] the we will that we will live in brother
[44:24] Branham just shortened it like we do
[44:25] like most of our southerners we take a
[44:27] lot of eyes and ease and ours and all
[44:29] that we add a few letters and we have
[44:31] warm urn and supper and dinner and all
[44:33] that other stuff so
[44:35] brother Brown said we'll live in that
[44:38] Millennial temple now so can that happen
[44:42] before the Battle of Armageddon can't so
[44:46] there's three full purpose over here for
[44:49] the people and then the Battle of
[44:51] Armageddon is going to destroy
[44:52] everything and then a new temple is
[44:55] gonna be built inside that 490 years all
[44:59] right not four hundred and eighty four
[45:05] hundred and eighty nine four hundred
[45:10] eighty six and a half as most people
[45:13] believe but four hundred ninety years
[45:17] from the time this begins until that
[45:21] millennial temple is to be built it's
[45:24] gonna take 490 years now we're gonna get
[45:26] into the dates later on but now let's go
[45:28] through these three periods if you have
[45:30] your chart you can read it but I'm gonna
[45:33] fix them to draw another one right here
[45:34] so let's read this again three periods
[45:38] of time so this time 490 years this time
[45:45] all right so dang let's go to Daniel
[45:47] 9:27 how'd that get shifted over a
[45:51] little bit
[45:52] all right seventy weeks are determined
[45:54] upon thy people and upon the holy city
[45:56] to finish the transgression to make an
[45:58] end of sins to make reconciliation for
[46:00] iniquity to bring in everlasting
[46:02] righteousness to seal up the vision and
[46:04] prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[46:07] all right so that's all that's all gonna
[46:10] happen all right here's what we're gonna
[46:12] focus on right now know therefore and
[46:14] understand that from the going forth of
[46:16] the commandment to restore and build
[46:17] jerusalem until Messiah the Prince shall
[46:20] be seven weeks now that's gonna be our
[46:22] starting point it's got to start
[46:25] somewhere
[46:26] there is something given there's an
[46:28] there's an edict given that we're gonna
[46:30] look at the different dates and we're
[46:33] gonna see when it started we know when
[46:36] it ends I'm gonna put this already over
[46:38] here we know when this ends until
[46:40] there's 490 years between right here and
[46:44] right here
[46:44] right
[46:46] seventy times seven 490 years
[46:48] something's gotta happen in between that
[46:51] time to bring Israel and to bring these
[46:54] prophecies to pass and to bring a new
[46:57] city because here's the millennium
[47:02] alright and here's here's revelations
[47:07] 1921 now brother Evans already said - I
[47:09] read it to you in the sixth full purpose
[47:14] revelations 19 this when the bride comes
[47:16] back into millennium into that temple
[47:20] that we just talked about everybody got
[47:22] that same an all right so know therefore
[47:25] and understand that from the going forth
[47:26] of commandment to restore build
[47:28] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[47:29] shall be seven weeks right everybody got
[47:34] that that's seven weeks now what's 7
[47:38] times 7 49 years first period and
[47:51] threescore and two weeks that's another
[47:55] period which would be threescore will be
[48:01] 62 that right 62 weeks if I got that say
[48:09] man that'd be 62 a rest read it again
[48:14] know therefore and understand that from
[48:16] the going forth of commandment to
[48:18] restore and build jerusalem unto messiah
[48:20] the prince shall be seven weeks we got
[48:25] that and threescore in two weeks
[48:29] alright the street shall be built again
[48:33] and the wall even in troublous time and
[48:35] after threescore and two weeks shall
[48:37] Messiah be cut off so right here's
[48:40] Calvary if you look on your sheet of
[48:41] paper brother branham and put a cross
[48:43] right there go that's where he was cut
[48:45] off now
[48:46] you got to remember that
[48:54] this time period is not added this is
[49:00] Gentiles this is the church ages has
[49:03] nothing to do like I said before if
[49:05] Israel had not of rejected Christ you
[49:10] would have had three periods that it
[49:12] would have fitted right here okay but
[49:17] moot point didn't happen that way
[49:21] so this is the church ages this is the
[49:25] bride everybody got that say man Jesus
[49:29] Christ came right here this is Calvary
[49:31] it says read it one more time know
[49:34] therefore and understand that from the
[49:35] going forth of the commandment to
[49:36] restore and build Jerusalem unto them
[49:38] aside the prince whose Messiah the
[49:39] Prince Jesus Christ shall be seven weeks
[49:41] and threescore and two weeks everybody
[49:44] got that
[49:45] alright the street shall be built again
[49:50] the wall even in troublous times
[49:51] everybody got that and after threescore
[49:59] and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off
[50:01] but not for himself who was he cut off
[50:04] for us will as in that last quote he was
[50:11] cut out four wheel we're the bride he
[50:16] was cut off for us now sure he was cut
[50:17] off for Jerusalem too but he was cut off
[50:19] so that we this is the wild olive tree
[50:22] to olive branch that was grafted in
[50:24] right here everybody got that all right
[50:29] so that's one period two periods this is
[50:35] not a period this we're not included
[50:37] remember we're not included in this and
[50:40] then you've got number three we're
[50:45] reading right here just a second right
[50:46] here
[50:49] everybody good make sure I got this
[50:53] right
[50:56] no I forgot one so this is 434 years I
[51:02] forgot it sorry
[51:03] so now 434 and 49 is what 483 years in
[51:13] my mouth right if Deana was here she'd
[51:14] say yes now we got to get 490 there's
[51:20] 483 to Calvary don't you explain to me
[51:24] how there's only three and a half years
[51:26] left after the rapture 483 years plus
[51:34] three and a half its 486 and a half
[51:37] that's not 490 so the Bible's right
[51:42] there's one week left after the rapture
[51:49] sixty-two and seven is 69 and one mate
[51:53] seventy that's just as plain as plain
[51:55] can be everybody got that
[51:57] all right and after threescore and two
[52:02] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[52:04] for himself and the people of the prince
[52:05] that shall come shall destroy the city
[52:07] and the sanctuary now who was that that
[52:09] was Titus there was an overlap a little
[52:12] bitty piece come in here to AD 70 why
[52:15] did he do that he had to tear that
[52:18] temple down member it was here when
[52:20] Jesus was here temple was still there
[52:22] they were doing you know he ran him out
[52:25] of the temple but in AD 70 Titus had to
[52:28] destroy it it's never been rebuilt right
[52:35] man's gonna try to build it right here
[52:40] but the real ones gonna be built right
[52:42] here because it's Daniel and thy people
[52:46] the people and the city yeah I got that
[52:50] the people are gonna be redeemed by the
[52:53] two prophets and the city's gonna be
[52:55] rebuilt for us to enter into the
[52:57] millenniums everybody got that all right
[53:00] now watch and the people of the prince
[53:04] that shall come shall destroy the city
[53:05] when Titus came in 80 70 if you'll
[53:09] google it
[53:10] look at that there was a what was it um
[53:14] Bob was here he tell you there's a mural
[53:17] in Rome and you can see Titus walking
[53:20] out Jerusalem you can see the temple
[53:22] burning and one soldiers got the menorah
[53:25] one soldiers got this the other soldiers
[53:27] got so all the equipment for the temple
[53:31] is in Rome they've got it now that's why
[53:37] that covenant is going to be made right
[53:39] here when we get out of here the Pope is
[53:42] gonna say hey got your stuff if you want
[53:45] to finish this let's talk about a
[53:47] covenant see it's so plain to us we can
[53:52] see all right now look says after
[53:55] threescore and two weeks shall Messiah
[53:56] be cut off but not for himself and the
[53:57] people the Prince come shall destroy the
[53:59] city and the sanctuary and the end there
[54:02] with the flood and to the end of the war
[54:04] desolations are determined and he shall
[54:08] confirm the covenant that's number three
[54:10] you've got one seven week period of
[54:13] sixty two week period and then he shall
[54:16] confirm the covenant who is he he is the
[54:19] Antichrist the only way he can have a
[54:21] covenant and him come into power is for
[54:24] us to be gone so the Gentile church age
[54:27] we go into rapture right there he makes
[54:30] a covenant with many for what one week
[54:33] so now you got 62 and seven and 69 and
[54:36] one meet one wakes one week make seventy
[54:39] seventy times seven is 490 years 483
[54:43] years are already accomplished
[54:45] you can't count any time in here
[54:48] remember times no longer for us but you
[54:51] got to come back for three and a half
[54:52] years of Jesus's ministry and then you
[54:55] got another part here this will be for
[54:57] the people this will be for the city to
[54:59] be rebuilt everybody okay with that go
[55:02] this is the Battle of Armageddon right
[55:03] here proved on your chart and proved by
[55:06] proved by after the 1260 days we read it
[55:09] in the scripture and he shall confirm
[55:11] the covenant with many for one week and
[55:13] in the midst of the week he shall cause
[55:16] the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
[55:18] told you what he's gonna do he's gonna
[55:20] walk in and say I'm God and for the
[55:23] overspreading of abominations he shall
[55:25] make it desolate even unto the
[55:27] consummation now what is the
[55:28] consummation the consummation is that
[55:30] last part of that of the four to fulfil
[55:32] - 490 years because here's the
[55:35] consummation the consummation brother
[55:37] Branham said was the Millennium alright
[55:40] that's the consummation now even until
[55:43] the consummation and that determined
[55:44] shall be poured out upon a desolate
[55:47] there's a desolation gonna happen right
[55:49] here that's the Battle of Armageddon
[55:52] then you've got to bring in everlasting
[55:55] righteousness self the vision prophecy
[55:56] in order to hope most holy you got one
[55:58] two three four five six that's why I
[56:00] said if you'll get to six fold purpose
[56:01] which only happens right here but you
[56:03] got to set it up by all these this
[56:06] temples got to be destroyed the people
[56:08] have got to turn Jesus down so they can
[56:11] be saved listen they're God's people
[56:14] back this way until they reject him
[56:17] they're his people when they built the
[56:21] temple it was built by it was built by
[56:23] the Jews that believed that Messiah was
[56:26] coming but then they didn't believe he
[56:30] was here they think he's coming over
[56:33] here you know why because God blinded
[56:37] them for that two thousand years to
[56:39] bring them back in so now let's read in
[56:41] number six now
[56:46] now let's outline Daniels 70 of weeks
[56:49] now I might repeat here again ministers
[56:52] of the gospel if you disagree with this
[56:54] all right they are divided into three
[56:57] periods as we find out in Daniel 9 three
[57:01] periods first a seven week period then a
[57:05] threescore and two which is 62 and then
[57:08] a one week period they're divided into
[57:11] three different periods there's no half
[57:15] weeks in there okay now I've got it
[57:19] divided here on the board
[57:21] it's the charts were looking at if you
[57:23] got the chart with you the first period
[57:25] second period now watch this look how
[57:29] positive he is now watch this is by no
[57:31] means of my way in Brenham but he this
[57:34] is what he's doing he said right here
[57:37] watch the first period he's pointing the
[57:40] first period the second period and to my
[57:43] understanding by the gospel by the Holy
[57:46] Spirit that the end time at the end time
[57:50] God returns again to the Jews so he's
[57:53] pointing right here if I got that say
[57:56] man
[57:56] now we know by all the Gospels that Paul
[57:59] taught and the others that God will
[58:01] return again to the Jews well then if
[58:04] he's going to return again to the Jews
[58:06] how can we apply it back in Daniels time
[58:09] we've got to apply it in this last stage
[58:12] and it's after the Gentile Church has
[58:15] been gone because he deals with Israel
[58:17] as a nation we as individuals he's that
[58:20] he's at this part right here he's at
[58:24] this part in this quote he's at this
[58:26] part right here all right let's read
[58:29] number 7 this is just to let you know
[58:33] that you know we talked about Google I
[58:38] just have to do a search we got a we got
[58:43] a message Google it's called the table
[58:46] amen and it's always right so watch you
[58:53] just gotta get your wording right we
[58:57] know now that each week meant seven
[58:59] years have you got it let's say it
[59:01] together one week equals seven years now
[59:05] we know we got it one week equals seven
[59:08] years here we are right here the first
[59:10] week brother Graham steps to the
[59:11] blackboard 49 years to rebuild the
[59:14] temple he's standing right here right
[59:18] now this top line here represents the
[59:21] Jewish nation as it goes you talk about
[59:22] this line right here right the Jewish
[59:25] nation as it goes across this is just
[59:27] timing when it drops down here it drops
[59:28] out of the Jewish nation into the
[59:30] Gentile time right here there's no line
[59:31] on your chart it's just this part of the
[59:34] seven churches everybody got that then
[59:37] goes up again and catches Israel this
[59:40] line right here because it should be a
[59:42] straight line if they hadn't have done
[59:45] what they'd done it had just been a
[59:46] straight line across
[59:49] all right actually there's no way it
[59:52] could have happen because they would
[59:53] have accept him here accepted him here
[59:55] and they went in a rapture they would've
[59:58] been none of this falling because they
[59:59] wouldn't fell if they would but see
[1:00:01] since they turned him down they fell and
[1:00:03] had to be restored and city fell and had
[1:00:05] to be restored is that okay all right
[1:00:09] let's go to number eight this is kind of
[1:00:11] a long quote but just 20 after that
[1:00:15] we're good now we got three different
[1:00:17] calendars here we are going by reading
[1:00:19] the calendar we go back to the old
[1:00:21] astronomy calendar when we find out that
[1:00:23] in the Julian calendar there's 365 and a
[1:00:26] quarter days in the year they timed that
[1:00:29] by the passing of Sardis and the
[1:00:30] different stars and so forth they timed
[1:00:32] it now we find in the Roman calendar
[1:00:35] that we live under now 365 days in the
[1:00:37] year by the calendar but in the
[1:00:39] Christian or prophetic calendar we find
[1:00:42] there's only 360 days in a year now you
[1:00:46] might wonder how this confusion came
[1:00:48] about now this is I can only say as
[1:00:50] myself speaking I believe that back
[1:00:52] before the antediluvian destruction back
[1:00:56] in the days of Jobin 4 so forth that
[1:00:58] they kept the time by the stars now he
[1:01:01] marks it the flood antediluvian flood
[1:01:05] that's the answer delivering flood right
[1:01:06] before the flood they kept it by the
[1:01:09] Stars and will understand or back before
[1:01:11] that time that the world stood upright
[1:01:12] and then in the sin of man the overflow
[1:01:16] of the world what's he talking about
[1:01:18] talk about the flood before the flood
[1:01:22] and the sin of man the over for the
[1:01:25] world and it tilted and the floods came
[1:01:28] therefore we have the great ice glaciers
[1:01:30] and so forth see I wasn't just I had a
[1:01:33] quote to back it up we have the great
[1:01:35] ice glaciers and so forth and all the
[1:01:37] top and bottom of the earth is full of
[1:01:39] ice it wasn't before because it stood
[1:01:42] straight up now it tilts away from the
[1:01:43] Sun but we're hidden we're hitting now
[1:01:45] where we're tilting away cuz this
[1:01:47] wintertime Sun didn't move we moved you
[1:01:50] know we tilted we wobbled that shook it
[1:01:53] wait a minute
[1:01:56] top of the earth is ice and bottom the
[1:01:58] earth life we know that and the earth
[1:02:00] does not sit straight up it's tilted
[1:02:02] that shook it out from where the moon
[1:02:04] and the stars were they were looking at
[1:02:06] and misplaced then or you could not keep
[1:02:08] time by it anymore because it's sitting
[1:02:10] lopsided that's what I said they let it
[1:02:13] go they let the calendar go for several
[1:02:14] years and it happened to be that April
[1:02:18] was had begin to be the middle of
[1:02:20] wintertime or something they got way off
[1:02:21] because see they go by spring April is
[1:02:24] the first day of the Jewish calendar
[1:02:26] first month of the Jewish calendar so
[1:02:29] everything is hens don't April all right
[1:02:32] or the spring time because they're
[1:02:34] sitting lopsided sitting tilted back
[1:02:35] therefore it would not hit them stars at
[1:02:37] the same time because it's out of cater
[1:02:39] to them stars you understand I believe
[1:02:41] that's what it is all right keep going
[1:02:43] it's laying back they slam back in that
[1:02:47] condition and that only shows that this
[1:02:49] is just a period of time can't you see
[1:02:52] God don't have things out of cater he's
[1:02:54] just letting it run like that for a
[1:02:56] little time and I truly believe that
[1:02:59] that thing was done and at this last day
[1:03:01] is when God is going to reveal the
[1:03:03] secrets to the church in other words
[1:03:06] tell us to use 360 days it doesn't
[1:03:09] matter how much is open the calendars
[1:03:10] 365 and a quarter use 360 days he hasn't
[1:03:15] done it before and the reason he hasn't
[1:03:17] done it is to keep the church watching
[1:03:18] in other words he hasn't revealed this
[1:03:20] till now keep the church watching and
[1:03:23] praying all the time not knowing when
[1:03:24] it's coming but you remember in Daniel
[1:03:27] 12 he said the wise shall understand in
[1:03:29] the last in this last day it's been
[1:03:32] given to him the spirit of wisdom comes
[1:03:34] into the church to make known to the
[1:03:36] church by the revelation of the Holy
[1:03:38] Ghost bringing the church in and
[1:03:40] revealing what day we're living in just
[1:03:43] the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the
[1:03:45] Holy Spirit comes to the church in the
[1:03:49] last day to reveal these great deep
[1:03:51] secret things do you understand now now
[1:03:54] what would knock out that as astronomic
[1:03:57] astronomy year are the julian year
[1:04:00] calendar the masonic year i've never
[1:04:02] heard of that one but because the worlds
[1:04:05] tilted we all know that from studying
[1:04:06] school and it's out of cater
[1:04:08] therefore they then stars wouldn't pass
[1:04:10] the line of the earth at the same time
[1:04:11] therefore the Roman calendar is wrong
[1:04:13] too
[1:04:14] because you cannot put together the days
[1:04:15] there's just many things that I could
[1:04:17] say right here that we find out by even
[1:04:19] nature's most elemental sisters and all
[1:04:21] the different things itself teaches us
[1:04:24] that there's only 30 days exactly now
[1:04:26] he'd meant he said year but you know he
[1:04:29] didn't mean year they ain't never been
[1:04:31] 30 days in a year it was 30 days in a
[1:04:34] month
[1:04:34] now let's take revelations where we're
[1:04:36] going to have to go over here in the
[1:04:38] days of the two prophets the Bible said
[1:04:39] they prophesied one thousand two hundred
[1:04:41] and threescore days now we take the
[1:04:43] astronomy calendar it sure wouldn't miss
[1:04:45] it a long way from being 3 and 1/2 years
[1:04:47] and we take the Roman calendar that we
[1:04:50] have today it would miss it a long way
[1:04:51] but you take the prophetic calendar and
[1:04:54] there's exactly one thousand two hundred
[1:04:56] and threescore days in 30 days to the
[1:04:59] month everybody got that that's why
[1:05:01] we're going to every everything that
[1:05:03] we're going to look at from this point
[1:05:04] back it's 360 days to the year all right
[1:05:08] so you got three periods you've got one
[1:05:10] period that's what seven weeks 62 weeks
[1:05:13] make 69 and then one week period right
[1:05:18] here is everybody got that same m3
[1:05:21] brother Brown said three distinct
[1:05:23] periods now there's no half weeks in any
[1:05:26] of this everybody got that show it to me
[1:05:30] right now somebody show it to me
[1:05:33] there's not one it's a one week a sixty
[1:05:38] two week and in one week added up that
[1:05:42] makes seventy are 490 years 483 years
[1:05:47] have already passed according to the
[1:05:48] Bible according to the prophets message
[1:05:50] and there's one week left after we leave
[1:05:53] to finish now listen to me to finish
[1:05:55] Daniel 70 weeks not to finish 1260 days
[1:05:59] of the Prophet sign that's different
[1:06:01] that's inside it but it's different
[1:06:04] because the Bible says there's one week
[1:06:06] left after the treaty has been made
[1:06:09] everybody good with that just telling
[1:06:11] you what the Bible says all right so now
[1:06:13] let's go to number nine let's read this
[1:06:14] and then we'll be done the 70th week of
[1:06:17] Daniel this would be when he's preaching
[1:06:19] the 70th week of Daniel
[1:06:23] now we are told from the going forth of
[1:06:26] the commandment now here's where trouble
[1:06:28] now we're told from the going forth of
[1:06:31] the commandment to rebuild the city to
[1:06:32] Messiah and Messiah was Christ of course
[1:06:36] shall be seven weeks right there
[1:06:39] and threescore and two weeks sixty-two
[1:06:42] weeks making 69 weeks all right 69 right
[1:06:50] there which makes 483 years all right
[1:06:54] seven times 69 there's no half weeks
[1:06:57] anybody know there's a half week in here
[1:06:58] anywhere zero all four weeks now you're
[1:07:05] getting it down seven times sixty-nine
[1:07:07] makes four hundred and eighty three
[1:07:08] years now we got to have four hundred
[1:07:10] and ninety to finish the transgression
[1:07:13] make an end of sin reconciliation for
[1:07:15] iniquity bringing everlasting
[1:07:17] righteousness cell division and prophecy
[1:07:18] and anoint the most holy
[1:07:20] everybody got that right now you getting
[1:07:24] it down if you want me to run over it
[1:07:26] again I'll be glad to and guess what
[1:07:27] I'll be glad to - we've been over and
[1:07:29] over it would it's okay we got we got to
[1:07:31] get we got to get everybody have a good
[1:07:33] fresh revelation now we are told from
[1:07:36] the going forth of the commandment to
[1:07:37] rebuild the city - Messiah shall be
[1:07:39] seven seven that's the first right here
[1:07:42] he's pointing right here scroll it up so
[1:07:45] everybody can see it please seven that's
[1:07:48] the first right here seven weeks and
[1:07:51] threescore and two weeks mate 62 and
[1:07:54] seven and 69 he said it again sixty-nine
[1:07:57] weeks seven times sixty-nine would make
[1:08:00] 483 years therefore until the Messiah
[1:08:03] now we're coming up to this part here
[1:08:06] until the Messiah there's got to be 483
[1:08:10] years right here because where did Jesus
[1:08:12] come on the scene right here all right
[1:08:15] he came in and you know we can go
[1:08:17] through the many times we went through
[1:08:19] it before a long time ago where Jesus
[1:08:21] was born in 4 BC he was not born and
[1:08:24] there's no ad zro it went from it went
[1:08:29] from BC 1
[1:08:32] - 81 not 80 zero if I got that say man
[1:08:38] so if he's born in 4 BC which will we
[1:08:41] may go through that but to me it's
[1:08:42] really immaterial it's not though if you
[1:08:45] look at what brother Bram talks about
[1:08:46] Jesus being crucified in 80 30
[1:08:50] because he was 33 years old when he died
[1:08:53] he wasn't thirty all right so he had to
[1:08:57] be born sometime before 81 and we'll
[1:09:01] prove that we've already proved that
[1:09:03] we've got we've got sermons on it before
[1:09:04] that he was born around 4 BC because
[1:09:07] that's when Herod came into into into
[1:09:10] power made - he shows up somewhere in
[1:09:14] there and says well they said well when
[1:09:16] did the Messiah show up and they said
[1:09:18] well two years he said we'll kill every
[1:09:19] baby remember he said kill every baby
[1:09:21] from two years back right all right I'm
[1:09:25] told you knew he was born somewhere in
[1:09:26] that time you know so he said okay from
[1:09:28] this time I want everybody all the kids
[1:09:30] that are two years old all the Hebrew
[1:09:31] babies I want him dead he's trying to
[1:09:33] kill Jesus but he was born in 4 BC and
[1:09:36] then you look at ad 30
[1:09:37] it's where he marks if you look on your
[1:09:40] own your sheet and we will actually make
[1:09:43] it into that to make sure we prove that
[1:09:44] because it wasn't and brother Bram does
[1:09:47] make one statement he says ad 33 but it
[1:09:49] doesn't match ad 30 is what matches if
[1:09:53] you'll read your Daniel seventy weeks
[1:09:55] the 70th week you will find out where
[1:09:57] brother Brown says he rode into
[1:09:59] Jerusalem on a white donkey on April the
[1:10:02] 2nd ad 30 now that was when those 483
[1:10:08] years were coming to an end okay because
[1:10:12] the Messiah was fixing to be cut off if
[1:10:14] he rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday
[1:10:16] what is Palm Sunday thank you for those
[1:10:22] of you that don't know which you should
[1:10:24] have already known that's the week
[1:10:26] before the crucifixion right right
[1:10:29] before Passover so if he rode into
[1:10:32] Jerusalem on a white donkey on Palm
[1:10:35] Sunday 80 30 he died four days five days
[1:10:39] later
[1:10:41] or whatever it was that next coming to
[1:10:43] the next Friday he was dead he was cut
[1:10:46] off they said let his blood be on us and
[1:10:48] our children all that that we talked
[1:10:49] about happened right in that little spot
[1:10:52] and then he was crucified in April of
[1:10:58] 8030 so we'll explain that a little bit
[1:11:00] later so god bless you just watch this
[1:11:03] chart look at your charts you got read
[1:11:06] your Bible and tell me where there's a
[1:11:09] half week now remember what I said
[1:11:13] remember tell me where there's a half
[1:11:15] week in Daniel 70 we've I didn't say
[1:11:19] anything about 1260 days of this
[1:11:21] prophecy right here that's inside of the
[1:11:25] 70 weeks of Daniel that is not the last
[1:11:27] week it's inside the last week because
[1:11:31] the Bible says and brother Branham just
[1:11:33] said there's three distinct periods one
[1:11:36] more time musicians get ready to come
[1:11:38] there's a seven weeks sixty-two weeks
[1:11:43] make 69 or 483 years then there's one
[1:11:47] week left to finish the time if I
[1:11:53] understand that to finish the time of
[1:11:55] the 70 weeks of Daniel most people in
[1:12:01] the message and I'm telling you they'll
[1:12:02] fight you tooth-and-nail one preacher
[1:12:04] says that's a shin kicker they fight and
[1:12:08] tell you that this right here according
[1:12:09] to what brother Brown said of course
[1:12:11] brother Graham can't say what the Bible
[1:12:12] didn't say and I just read you the Bible
[1:12:15] said that he shall make a confirm a
[1:12:17] covenant minute for one week I don't
[1:12:20] understand that but they're putting that
[1:12:22] three and a half weeks right there right
[1:12:24] here and then there's only a half week
[1:12:27] left after the rapture I want somebody
[1:12:30] to bring meal bring me a Bible and show
[1:12:32] show me how that can happen it'll shut
[1:12:38] the mouth of the critics cuz you know
[1:12:39] what that I should have done that when
[1:12:40] they were arguing back and forth I said
[1:12:42] have you ever read Daniel 9:24 show me
[1:12:46] where there's a half week in there
[1:12:48] because the Bible faced final resting
[1:12:50] places in what the Word of God
[1:12:52] the Word of God is true musicians come
[1:12:56] musician one more time I know we don't
[1:12:59] have a whole bunch of them here today
[1:13:00] but the ones that are coming come up but
[1:13:05] study that pray about it cuz you we
[1:13:12] can't be wrong and get out of here we
[1:13:14] got to be right we got to be right
[1:13:34] that's what I said a long time ago and
[1:13:37] even brother Dale you people say that
[1:13:40] brother Brown changed it in the when the
[1:13:42] seals open I want you to show me where
[1:13:44] he changed it man
[1:13:47] you're just not getting what he said you
[1:13:49] got to listen you got to listen with
[1:13:51] revelation not would just verbatim
[1:13:53] quotes just like I said Jesus said eat
[1:13:55] my flesh and drink my blood seventy
[1:13:57] people turned and left but the others
[1:14:00] got a revelation and then how we done is
[1:14:02] last weekend we read to Revelation that
[1:14:05] Paul had where we took communion I mean
[1:14:08] we had a revelation we didn't walk away
[1:14:11] the 70 walked away as if a vampire
[1:14:13] we knew exactly you can keep doing that
[1:14:17] do it again with her brother Tim hymns
[1:14:23] Church a couple weeks ago that the organ
[1:14:26] player heed it went when brother Tim or
[1:14:28] I was speaking but somebody was singing
[1:14:30] a song and they were giving a testimony
[1:14:31] and the little guy over there with the
[1:14:33] guy give a testimony go Sarah
[1:14:41] follow script all right let's stand to
[1:14:45] our feet god bless you but this thing
[1:14:47] Daniel seventy weeks according to the
[1:14:49] Bible there's three periods and you
[1:14:52] can't make them any other way let's
[1:14:53] don't cut them up let's just see what
[1:14:56] God said you said well I got this quote
[1:14:57] well you know what if the quote doesn't
[1:15:00] match the Bible one more time
[1:15:03] your revelation of the quote is wrong I
[1:15:06] didn't say the quote was wrong
[1:15:08] brother branham was so sure that he had
[1:15:11] to get those seventy weeks of Daniel out
[1:15:13] of the way so he could bring the seals
[1:15:15] in why if he take out a question out of
[1:15:17] people's mind into daniel stamm many
[1:15:19] weeks then the seven seals would place
[1:15:20] right in where they're supposed to be
