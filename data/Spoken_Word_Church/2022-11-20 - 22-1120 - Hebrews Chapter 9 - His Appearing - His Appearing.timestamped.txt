[0:00] it's just by our heads oh God we're so
[0:01] grateful to be able together today Lord
[0:03] we ask Lord that you'll just prepare our
[0:05] hearts Lord God as we become ready to
[0:07] receive Lord from you this morning I
[0:09] pray Lord as we just study your word
[0:10] Lord that you'll help us that you'll
[0:12] grant us understanding Lord we ask your
[0:14] blessing upon the service today in the
[0:15] name of the Lord amen
[0:21] I I know that's a little bit small
[0:25] just bear with me while I read through
[0:27] but we're going to make our way to verse
[0:29] 28 now we're we're going through Hebrews
[0:32] chapter 9.
[0:33] and and I almost made it a chapter 10
[0:36] and it says in verse 24 it was therefore
[0:39] necessary that the patterns of things in
[0:41] the heavens should be purified with
[0:42] these but the Heavenly things themselves
[0:43] with better sacrifices than these for
[0:46] Christ has not entered into the holy
[0:48] places made made with hands which are
[0:49] the figures of the truth but into heaven
[0:52] itself now to appear in the presence of
[0:54] God for us nor yet that he should offer
[0:57] himself often as the high priest
[0:58] entereth into the holy place every year
[1:00] with blood of others but then must often
[1:03] have suffered since this for them must
[1:05] he often have suffered since the
[1:06] foundation of the world but now once in
[1:09] the end of the world hath he appeared to
[1:11] put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
[1:14] and as it is appointed unto men wants to
[1:16] die
[1:17] but after this the Judgment so Christ
[1:20] was once offered to Bear the sins of
[1:22] many and unto them that look for him
[1:24] shall he appear the second time without
[1:26] seeing unto salvation
[1:28] now I think last time I kind of pulled
[1:31] up some different translations of this
[1:33] scripture that we just kind of just kind
[1:34] of meditate on and unpack for a few
[1:36] minutes what and take a look at that
[1:38] that word appear that that Christ would
[1:41] appear he came up here the first time to
[1:43] die for our sins and the second time to
[1:47] finish the Redemption
[1:48] so the New Living Translation if you
[1:50] want to look at that it says he's going
[1:52] to come again not to deal with our sins
[1:53] but to bring Salvation to all who
[1:55] eagerly are are eagerly waiting for him
[1:58] and the Amplified Bible says
[2:01] so Christ having been offered once and
[2:03] once and once for all to bear and and in
[2:06] in parentheses as a burden the sins of
[2:08] many will appear a second time when he
[2:11] returns to earth not to deal with sin
[2:13] but to bring Salvation to those who are
[2:15] eagerly and confidently waiting for him
[2:18] and the Aramaic Bible in plain English
[2:20] says in this way also the Messiah was
[2:22] offered one time and he slaughtered in
[2:24] his person the sins of the many but the
[2:26] second time he appears without our sins
[2:28] for the life of those who expect him and
[2:31] in the way my new testament version says
[2:33] so the Christ also having been offered
[2:35] once offered in sacrificed in order that
[2:37] he might bear the sins of many will
[2:39] appear a second time separated from sin
[2:41] to those who are eagerly expecting him
[2:44] to make their salvation complete
[2:47] so he died he appeared once on the scene
[2:51] to die on the cross and then it will
[2:52] appear the second time to finish the
[2:55] work of salvation
[2:57] now brother Brown said in 1962 and God
[2:59] has a provided a way he's had which one
[3:01] of the prophets did you now kind of keep
[3:04] in mind we're going to kind of separate
[3:05] and kind of talk about appearing versus
[3:07] the coming and what brother Ram said
[3:09] about those things and he said which one
[3:11] of the prophets did your father's not
[3:13] Stone because they didn't know their day
[3:15] if you'd have known me you would have
[3:17] known my date if they didn't know John
[3:19] until he was dead buried so now John is
[3:22] proclaiming that Christ is here and then
[3:24] Jesus came and they didn't recognize him
[3:26] he said they didn't know Jesus till he
[3:28] died until he dead buried they didn't
[3:30] know Saint Patrick Joan of Arc the
[3:32] Catholic church burned her as a witch to
[3:34] the post because the woman had power and
[3:36] prayer and saw visions and they said she
[3:38] was a fortune teller a witch and they
[3:40] burnt that woman screaming for Mercy oh
[3:43] of course you done Penance 200 years
[3:45] later dug up them priest's body and
[3:47] throw them but it passed by you and you
[3:49] didn't know it even the disciples said
[3:50] why does the scribe say Elias must first
[3:53] come
[3:54] said Elias has already come and you
[3:57] didn't know it goes over your head and
[3:59] you didn't know it don't miss it now see
[4:01] remember go back to what Paul is saying
[4:03] here in verse 28 and unto them that look
[4:06] for him shall he appear the second time
[4:08] to those that look for him and can
[4:10] recognize so to finish that quote he
[4:13] said now remember these two words before
[4:14] I leave you the appearing of Christ and
[4:17] the coming of Christ is two different
[4:19] things
[4:21] Christ is now appearing in the fullness
[4:23] of his power is coming will be
[4:25] afterwards he's appearing before his
[4:27] coming God be merciful and and and just
[4:30] to kind of borrow an example that I I
[4:32] was listening to a sermon that brother
[4:33] Wade preached back in 20 uh 10 years ago
[4:36] and he was using the example of down
[4:38] through the Old Testament you could see
[4:39] the the that God would appear and in the
[4:42] lives of of uh all of these Old
[4:44] Testament prophets and then finally he
[4:47] comes upon the scene and so what's
[4:49] what's the difference really if you if
[4:51] you meditate on the appearing and the
[4:53] coming the appearing and the coming is
[4:54] the perspective of where you are the
[4:57] coming of the Lord is that Christ
[4:58] revealing himself personally to you but
[5:01] if his Christ is not he could be in a
[5:03] church service and see see uh I like
[5:06] somebody you know you hear people
[5:08] testify of seeing that eyes actually
[5:10] appear in the little boy's head and
[5:12] brother around his meetings and see
[5:14] Christ actually appearing and
[5:15] manifesting himself but yet God will not
[5:18] reveal his word to you if you're not
[5:19] born again
[5:20] so you can see that you can be in a
[5:23] church service where you can see Christ
[5:24] appearing and being manifested and and
[5:27] hair being restored it's lost and signs
[5:30] and wonders being done and the lives of
[5:32] Christ and the people and God appearing
[5:34] but yet not recognize his coming
[5:37] amen now you see the coming of the Lord
[5:39] is it's almost like to use an example
[5:41] like a snowball that that really you
[5:43] know you could almost say that the
[5:45] coming of the Lord started on the day of
[5:46] Pentecost and began to snowball down
[5:48] until Christ is here and he's he's come
[5:50] and then we meet him in the clouds we go
[5:53] to meet him in the in the skies and we
[5:54] we see him visibly he's he's here and
[5:57] then move on into the uh when he
[6:01] physically comes back uh like the
[6:02] scripture says on a white horse riding
[6:05] with the Saints uh metaphorically
[6:07] speaking of the of the of him returning
[6:09] back in the in the Millennium so it's
[6:11] it's like a snowball where he's he's
[6:13] he's a precept upon precept a line up
[6:17] online adding until until he's manifest
[6:19] and so you see how the we'll we'll say
[6:23] things like you know the Rapture is
[6:25] taking place right now and you could be
[6:27] missing it if you don't recognize his
[6:29] coming because the Raptor is a process
[6:31] where the word is being built up within
[6:33] us until it it it it it it comes to a uh
[6:37] comes to a head comes to a headstone so
[6:40] brother Ryan would say and from that
[6:42] time in 1962 he said how many knows
[6:44] there's a difference between the
[6:46] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[6:47] Christ
[6:48] it's two different words now is the
[6:51] appearing the coming will soon be he's
[6:53] appearing in the midst of us doing the
[6:55] works that he once did in his church now
[6:58] you are part of that church and by Grace
[7:00] you believe I'm a member of that church
[7:02] you can see the pattern that he's kind
[7:05] of laying down you know there's so many
[7:07] sat in brother around his meetings back
[7:08] then when he'd say it's and then see
[7:11] Christ appearing and Christ did Christ
[7:13] being made manifest in their midst and
[7:15] yet not recognize the word that he was
[7:17] preaching but I think see that now we're
[7:20] we're I believe we're at a different
[7:22] place where back then that people
[7:23] sitting there didn't didn't he was
[7:25] preaching to denominational people and
[7:27] people that didn't really believe what
[7:29] he what he was preaching but now we're
[7:31] we're what a privilege to be able to
[7:33] preach to people that believe what what
[7:35] brother Ann preached and we're we're
[7:38] actually have an opportunity now to
[7:39] really do what brother randomly but
[7:41] never never fully had an opportunity to
[7:43] do to preach to people that knew what
[7:45] the message was and could recognize the
[7:48] coming of the Lord
[7:49] so you can see you can see the
[7:51] difference now when when Christ was
[7:53] there in those meetings but so and he he
[7:56] appeared to people in the meetings and
[7:57] his his appearance was made known but
[7:59] yet they didn't recognize that Christ
[8:01] was there
[8:03] right so brother said and we would see
[8:04] Jesus he said now what why didn't we he
[8:06] said he why didn't he do those signs for
[8:09] the Gentiles it never was performed by
[8:11] him why Gentiles wasn't looking for no
[8:13] Messiah
[8:14] it goes back to what Paul's saying unto
[8:16] them that looked for him shall he appear
[8:18] the second time without sin unto
[8:20] salvation they were heathens we were our
[8:22] people Romans and so forth back there
[8:24] with a club on their back or worshiping
[8:26] Idols they wasn't looking for no Messiah
[8:28] and Messiah only comes to those who are
[8:31] looking for it that's the only way to
[8:33] them that look for him will he appear
[8:35] the second time just those who are
[8:37] looking for him not just two who
[8:39] pertaining but those who are really
[8:40] looking for him and notice he never come
[8:42] to Gentile that miracle was never
[8:45] performed before a gentile
[8:46] and the unchangeable God now we've had 2
[8:49] 000 years of scholarship and all kinds
[8:51] of things and now it's come evening time
[8:54] and now the Gentiles are looking for a
[8:56] coming Messiah now if he's the same he
[8:59] appeared the same then to them two
[9:01] tribes he's got to appear the same way
[9:04] there and promise though now you see the
[9:07] pattern that brother Brown is laying out
[9:08] is that John the Baptist introduced that
[9:11] Christ was here and now now brother
[9:13] Branham the the Elijah in this day was
[9:16] to introduce that he's come to introduce
[9:18] the coming Messiah
[9:20] so brother Raymond and it is I be not
[9:22] afraid he said now when Jesus was on
[9:24] Earth he declared himself to be the
[9:25] Messiah and John declared there was a
[9:28] messiah sign followed him and the Old
[9:30] Testament claimed there would be a Old
[9:31] Testament claim there would be a messiah
[9:33] sign and he proved that sign to the
[9:35] people that he was the Messiah
[9:37] how they knowed it was he was a god
[9:39] Prophet Moses the one that they had
[9:41] followed said the Lord your God shall
[9:43] raise up a prophet like an enemy we know
[9:46] that we're aware of that and amongst the
[9:49] Jews and the Samaritans he showed the
[9:51] sign but of course he never amongst the
[9:53] Gentiles because we were heathens in
[9:55] those days our people the Gentiles
[9:57] Romans we wasn't looking for no Messiah
[9:59] and Messiah only appears to those who's
[10:02] looking for him that's the way
[10:05] those who wait for him he will appear
[10:07] the second time so it would behoove us
[10:09] tonight to be waiting for him and
[10:12] watching for him that we do not miss it
[10:14] when he comes
[10:15] foreign
[10:17] back in in what was the Holy Ghost given
[10:21] for he said he was talking about
[10:23] baptizing the 17th person there on the
[10:25] Ohio River and he said the voice spoke
[10:28] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[10:30] the first coming of Christ you'll have a
[10:31] message that will forerun the second
[10:33] coming of Christ and it was showing
[10:35] forth his coming down down through so
[10:37] you we you can see that pattern of the
[10:39] messenger and and I'm taking a step back
[10:41] just so you can see the difference here
[10:43] as we as we kind of meditate on this and
[10:46] from that time he said people are
[10:48] unconcerned just exactly like it was in
[10:51] the days of Sodom just exactly like it
[10:53] was in the days of Noah scoffers fun
[10:55] makers the angel of the Lord is here and
[10:58] the last sign that he promised to give
[11:00] the church is now appearing amongst the
[11:03] people and they don't recognize it
[11:06] what do those Pharisees stand in their
[11:08] religious good people church members
[11:10] find people they said in their hearts in
[11:12] their hearts not with their lips they
[11:14] said this man is a spiritualist a
[11:16] fortune teller Beelzebub he does that by
[11:19] the prince of the Devils Beelzebub now
[11:21] you think about what a great thing that
[11:22] God would actually appear in the midst
[11:24] of the people and raise up a man from
[11:25] the dead and he'd be sitting there and
[11:26] they wouldn't recognize it that God
[11:28] would appear and they couldn't recognize
[11:30] to recognize that God's presence I'll
[11:33] use another example I will bar Allah
[11:35] from Brother Wade this morning that he
[11:37] another example was Cain and Esau that
[11:39] Cain could not recognize that that God
[11:42] would would consume Abel's sacrifice
[11:45] with a Holy Fire come down with the fire
[11:47] of God and consume that off the Altar
[11:49] and would still not do
[11:51] what he saw Abel doing but Abel did it
[11:53] by Revelation so there is there there's
[11:56] your difference the coming of the Lord
[11:58] is a revelation to you personally of who
[12:00] Jesus Christ is that's built up within
[12:02] you like a snowball until God is there
[12:05] on the scene
[12:06] until actually God is is moving
[12:09] manifesting himself in the midst of the
[12:11] people and yet people don't recognize it
[12:14] like the Pharisees and the and and all
[12:16] them back there that said that Jesus was
[12:18] the devil
[12:20] so in perseverance brother Adam said so
[12:22] the Lord is now appearing among his
[12:23] people great signs and wonders raising
[12:25] the dead Healing The Sick and doing the
[12:28] very same things that he did that hasn't
[12:30] been done for 2 000 years see the church
[12:33] is honed up through that brought up till
[12:35] it's right at the time The Headstone is
[12:37] coming to meet the church and then it'll
[12:39] all go together and be raptured
[12:42] he said and behold the greater than
[12:44] Solomon is here as Jonah was in the
[12:46] belly of the well the son of man will be
[12:48] in the heart of the earth many people
[12:50] today think he's still there but he's
[12:52] not dead he's risen from the dead and
[12:54] he's here with us now appearing Among Us
[12:56] proving himself up and down the coast
[12:59] around the world everywhere that he
[13:01] lives and the wicked and the adulterous
[13:04] generation sees a sign that Jesus Christ
[13:06] is alive and not dead a wicked and an
[13:09] adulterous generation will seek after a
[13:11] sign and they'll get it the sign of the
[13:13] Resurrection let us soak real deep now
[13:16] study hard
[13:18] and he said in Jehovah Jireh this is the
[13:21] close of the royal Seas waiting he's
[13:22] here the appearing of Christ there's a
[13:25] place in the Bible you know I ain't got
[13:27] time to go into us as the appearing of
[13:29] Christ and then the coming of Christ
[13:31] there's two that's two different things
[13:33] all together
[13:35] the appearing and the coming he's
[13:37] appearing now working with us in the
[13:39] form of the Holy Spirit making it just
[13:42] perfect the church it has to like if
[13:44] you've got a dollar bill in your pocket
[13:45] take it out and look on one side it's
[13:48] the American seal on the other side it's
[13:51] an Egyptian seal the pyramid with a
[13:54] headstone way up above it like an eye
[13:55] looking and why would American dollar
[13:58] put beneath there the Great Seal
[14:00] looked like the American seal would be
[14:02] the Great Seal there but the United
[14:04] States government recognizes it whether
[14:06] they want to or not the Great Seal watch
[14:09] that pyramid as he shapes up the church
[14:11] justification sanctification baptism of
[14:14] the Holy Ghost and then that's got to be
[14:16] honed out to When The Headstone never
[14:17] did come to the pyramid it was rejected
[14:19] just like the Cornerstone now but when
[14:21] that headstone comes I've been to the
[14:24] pyramid it's just so perfectly fit you
[14:26] couldn't run a razor blade between
[14:27] between it where the mortar is at and
[14:30] when the church comes
[14:32] when Christ comes to receive his church
[14:34] the church will have the ministry just
[14:37] exactly like that and through that Grace
[14:39] will raise the whole thing then go the
[14:43] coming of The Headstone crying Grace
[14:45] under the Lord
[14:46] now as we read that quote I hope maybe
[14:49] you can see how almost it's kind of
[14:50] difficult to even express these thoughts
[14:52] that the coming and the appearing could
[14:54] be together and they're yet different
[14:57] and the coming could be in the future
[14:59] but yet now because the coming of the
[15:02] Lord is that we're waiting for the
[15:03] coming of The Headstone but yet Christ
[15:05] is coming now as he Reveals His word
[15:07] he's revealing but he's going to be
[15:09] present when The Headstone comes we're
[15:10] looking for The Headstone comes we're
[15:12] looking to see Christ bodily one day in
[15:14] the Millennium we're looking to see but
[15:16] but now Christ is coming now and even
[15:19] now as he's coming yet you could be
[15:20] looking at it and observing the
[15:22] influence of the coming of the Lord and
[15:24] Christ will be appearing to you and you
[15:26] not recognize it
[15:27] we don't we don't want to now we won't
[15:30] appearing is not just something bad you
[15:32] know people will say well we don't want
[15:33] the appearing no we won't this morning
[15:35] we won't as we as we open our hearts to
[15:37] receive the spirit we want to see Christ
[15:39] appearing in our midst we want to see we
[15:42] want to observe the acts of Christ
[15:45] manifesting himself in the body of
[15:47] Believers but how much greater to see
[15:49] the word open up to you to see Christ
[15:51] reveal himself to to see him like he he
[15:54] gave that promise he said I will not
[15:56] leave you comfortless but I will come to
[15:58] you now there's the coming of the Lord
[16:00] that Christ will reveal himself through
[16:02] his word and open himself up to you
[16:04] now if we let me just kind of skip over
[16:08] this I'm gonna we know we know all these
[16:10] scriptures about Elias truly shall first
[16:12] come and and looking for because what
[16:14] what is Elias supposed to do Elijah
[16:16] Elijah will and Malachi 45 6 the promise
[16:19] that that God is going to send and
[16:21] introduce her to to shift our thinking
[16:24] back to the original mode the original
[16:27] way that the original disciples and
[16:29] apostles thought so that we would be
[16:31] prepared to receive the coming of the
[16:33] Lord which is the fullness of his word
[16:35] in this age in the season that we're
[16:37] living in
[16:38] now the Jews will look at this scripture
[16:40] and they'll say that they know that
[16:42] Elijah is going to come before the
[16:44] Messiah so Elijah is is a as a precursor
[16:47] before the fullness of the word before
[16:49] their before their Messiah comes so they
[16:51] on Passover they they leave this spot at
[16:54] the table because they know Messiah is
[16:56] coming so so when you whenever you see
[16:59] whenever you see look in the scripture
[17:01] and see how John the Baptist came
[17:04] the son of man's coming right after that
[17:06] the fullness of the word and flesh
[17:07] whenever you look into the Bible
[17:10] and see how a lodge is coming in Malachi
[17:12] 456 and promise that here comes the
[17:15] fullness of the word right after that I
[17:17] said we get our we get our our minds so
[17:19] much sometimes on the man but after the
[17:21] the man's got a message and that message
[17:23] when people begin to receive it then
[17:26] that word begins to be made manifest in
[17:28] their life so now the Jews are looking
[17:30] for they've got this place set at the
[17:32] table
[17:33] and if you look on the internet of what
[17:34] the what the what what that means what
[17:37] the Jews think about that it says Jewish
[17:38] tradition teaches that Elijah the
[17:40] prophet will be the harbinger of the
[17:42] coming of the Messiah and the world's
[17:43] Redemption
[17:44] it is a chair of hope that chair that
[17:47] they that place they leave at the at the
[17:49] table at the Passover Elijah's Cup in
[17:51] Judaism the fifth ceremonial cup of wine
[17:53] poured during the family Cedar dinner on
[17:56] Passover is left untouched in honor of
[17:58] Elijah who according to belief
[18:01] will arrive one day as an unknown guest
[18:03] to Herald the Advent of the Messiah his
[18:06] presence now think about this that's so
[18:09] overlooked in the world today that we're
[18:11] living in when Elijah comes his presence
[18:14] signifies that the Messiah is here his
[18:18] presence signals the Messianic era a
[18:21] time of redemption peace and spiritual
[18:23] Bliss the full cup one for the future
[18:26] remains untouched to honor another
[18:28] hospitality and offer Hospitality to
[18:31] Elijah when he ultimately appears
[18:33] so go back to what Paul's saying here so
[18:36] Christ was once offered to Bear the sins
[18:38] of many he died on the cross for us but
[18:40] he's going to appear again and unto them
[18:43] that look for him shall he appear the
[18:44] second time without sin unto salvation
[18:46] now didn't Christ appear to us in this
[18:49] day visibly immediate you've heard
[18:51] people testify where they'd go into
[18:53] meetings and they they felt such a
[18:55] presence that they knew that when as
[18:57] soon as they walked through the doors
[18:58] they knew God was there and I was I was
[19:00] listening to a testimony online where
[19:03] this this is like she had bobbed hair
[19:04] and she was obviously not a message
[19:06] believer but she was talking about
[19:08] standing in the in in the in the prayer
[19:10] line in brother Brown's meetings and she
[19:13] looked down while brother Brown was
[19:14] praying for her and saw a wheel in the
[19:17] middle of the wheel turning as as God as
[19:20] brother Brown's the voice of the Lord
[19:21] through brother Ryan who spoke her
[19:23] healing to her now see there's the
[19:25] appearing you can see God actually
[19:27] manifest
[19:29] and yet not recognize because God's word
[19:31] is not revealed to you she received her
[19:33] healing you see how much greater is it
[19:36] for God to reveal himself to you and
[19:38] come to you and and
[19:40] just we'll compare it like this
[19:42] that's sitting on the on the hillside
[19:44] listening to Jesus while he passed out
[19:46] bread and fish and they could see God
[19:49] that God was there but he had not
[19:51] recognized the word that he was speaking
[19:53] to them
[19:55] what's the coming of the Lord I will not
[19:57] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[20:00] like a snowball until at the very end at
[20:03] the End of the Age Christ is made
[20:04] manifest not maybe so much in the little
[20:07] man but in you and these people sitting
[20:10] here looking at me
[20:12] those people sitting in brother right
[20:13] this is a if you can look real hard and
[20:15] squint real hard you can see brother
[20:16] Brown down on the stage preaching and
[20:18] and how many of those people recognize
[20:20] that Christ was in their midst and felt
[20:22] the anointing and saw God appearing but
[20:25] yet failed to understand the revelation
[20:27] of Jesus Christ Amen brother said in in
[20:31] the message look he said now if you just
[20:33] look upon it say I got a little crucifix
[20:35] hanging in my car I got one at my home
[20:37] across that's all right but that ain't
[20:40] what it is that's not what he's talking
[20:41] about you got to see that God knows that
[20:44] you are a sinner those that look for him
[20:46] shall he appear and that you have
[20:49] confessed your sins and God put your
[20:51] iniquity upon Him upon himself and put
[20:53] him and become a man he crossed his
[20:55] strain and come down from being God to
[20:57] be man that he might die and you're
[20:58] still to give his self for you and you
[21:00] confessed your sin and not a
[21:02] manufactured Clorox
[21:04] but a power of God that was made blood
[21:06] that he might take away your sinful
[21:08] Blood by sexual desire and make you a
[21:11] free man and woman of God there you are
[21:13] what are you looking at you say I belong
[21:15] so now the reason I put the slide in
[21:18] here let's take a step back is to show
[21:20] the difference between the appearing and
[21:21] the coming because it depends on how
[21:24] you're looking you can look with just
[21:26] your natural eyes and see Christ being
[21:28] made manifest in the meeting and and
[21:30] enjoy the anointing but if you look with
[21:32] your with your spiritual eye with by
[21:35] faith because manifestation is not the
[21:37] evidence but faith is the evidence of
[21:40] things hoped for
[21:41] faith is the evidence of your new birth
[21:43] so if you're looking by faith that it
[21:45] changes the picture if you're looking
[21:47] that's the coming of the Lord to you
[21:49] when he reveals himself to you
[21:51] what are you looking at you say I belong
[21:54] to a denomination Assemblies of God I
[21:56] belong to the United Pentecostal I
[21:58] belong to the Methodist the Baptist
[22:00] you're still focusing away Focus
[22:02] yourself in on Jesus Christ hear the
[22:05] answer come back all thy sins which are
[22:07] many
[22:08] are all forgiven now see see brother
[22:11] Branham come to to to to preach a word
[22:14] that would loose the holy spirit in our
[22:16] lives and so many cannot see to see what
[22:20] his purpose was and I I just kind of as
[22:22] an example before we close up here I'm
[22:24] we I think we've all seen that that
[22:26] comic strip of peanuts where let's just
[22:29] read through this I wish I could blow it
[22:31] up even more but he says
[22:34] all right
[22:36] golf oh I can't blow it up great
[22:40] I don't have my glasses I'm getting
[22:42] older y'all I need
[22:46] all right golf fans this is it the old
[22:49] pro has to make this one he's down to
[22:51] the last put and he can't play it safe
[22:53] he has to go for it There's No Tomorrow
[22:56] There's No Tomorrow there's no tomorrow
[23:00] they just announced on TVs that there's
[23:03] no tomorrow
[23:05] there's no tomorrow they just announced
[23:07] it on TV panic panic run hide flee Run
[23:11] for the Hills
[23:12] flee to The Valleys run to the rooftops
[23:16] but then they'll hold hold on a second
[23:17] if there's no tomorrow wait something
[23:19] was supposed to happen first
[23:23] somehow I never thought it would end
[23:25] this way and Snoopy says I thought
[23:27] Elijah was to come first
[23:31] I see even the comic strip and the
[23:34] Sunday paper testifies that Elijah's
[23:36] supposed to come first why to introduce
[23:38] the coming of the Lord
[23:41] that's why in Matthew 24 says watch
[23:43] therefore for ye know not what I or your
[23:45] lord doth come but know this that if the
[23:48] good man of the house had known and what
[23:50] watched the thief would come he would
[23:52] have watched and would not have suffered
[23:53] his house to be broken up therefore be
[23:55] also ready for in such an hour as you
[23:58] think not the son of man cometh now
[24:02] again let's not lose context of what
[24:04] we're talking about that Paul said so
[24:06] Christ was once offered to Bear the sins
[24:07] of many and unto them that look for him
[24:10] shall he appear the second time without
[24:13] sin unto salvation he's appearing the
[24:17] second time to finish your work of
[24:19] redemption to finish everything up to
[24:21] come in fullness so now what what's the
[24:24] coming in there period how are you
[24:26] looking if your eye if your natural Eyes
[24:28] Are Fixed On him you're just seeing him
[24:30] moving in the church you're seeing other
[24:31] people get a blessing you're seeing God
[24:33] move in the spirit you're you're seeing
[24:36] somebody else get filled with the Holy
[24:37] Ghost but if you're looking by eyes of
[24:40] faith God is real to you like that
[24:42] Deacon that was on the out on the on the
[24:44] boat with that little little girl in the
[24:45] church that asked him can you see God
[24:48] he said everywhere I look I see God
[24:51] because if you're looking by his face
[24:53] you can see God in your life you can see
[24:55] God in the sunrise you can see God and
[24:58] and nature you can see God everywhere
[25:00] you look you can see God how he's
[25:02] changing how he's changing how he's
[25:04] changed your family how he's changing
[25:06] your church everywhere you see so now we
[25:09] we we want to what what is the coming
[25:12] the coming is Christ revealing himself
[25:15] to you and you know and that in that
[25:17] message brother I'm priest where he went
[25:19] through all the Mysteries that have been
[25:20] revealed in this last day the mystery of
[25:22] the godhead the Kingdom of Heaven the
[25:23] New Testament Church is one mystery
[25:26] Babylon the mystery of iniquity serpent
[25:28] seed the Seven Stars the mystery of true
[25:30] Grace The Mystery of the baptism and
[25:32] Holy Ghost yeah I'm putting this out
[25:34] here so sometimes we don't realize what
[25:36] we're getting here when we come to
[25:37] church but it's it's building up line
[25:39] upon the line until until you know who
[25:42] God is no eternal hell and water baptism
[25:45] the pillar of fire returning back and
[25:47] the true anointing that's on the bride
[25:49] the statue of a perfect man adoption
[25:51] Israel's blindness the translation of
[25:53] the living Saints at the end of this age
[25:54] of the Seven Seals that's what that's
[25:56] what God is doing coming to reveal to us
[26:00] so in Hebrews chapter 10
[26:03] . oh we finished
[26:05] that's it
[26:07] we made it to Hebrews chapter 10.
[26:09] well let me just run through this
[26:10] outline
[26:12] before we before we close to just kind
[26:15] of background because in in chapter one
[26:17] I know that's real small again
[26:19] with chapter one we talked about how the
[26:21] the description of God's salvation this
[26:23] is just an outline of the book of
[26:25] Hebrews
[26:26] that God had provided a way for us to be
[26:29] saved
[26:30] that that he was Superior to angels and
[26:33] and and and and Paul outlined uh that
[26:37] God came down in flesh and manifested
[26:39] himself in Jesus Christ
[26:41] that he was higher than than every
[26:44] Apostle and priest and anybody who'd
[26:46] ever brought a message before
[26:48] in chapter in chapter three he talked
[26:50] about entering into God's rest and how
[26:52] the dangers are missing that rest and
[26:54] and how to be disqualified from getting
[26:56] that rest and how the rest is really
[26:58] resting upon God's word and not on our
[27:00] own ideas and and and the word of God is
[27:03] how we're is our is our guard as our
[27:05] protection and then in chapter four the
[27:08] priesthood of of God's salvation and
[27:10] talked about the priesthood of
[27:12] Melchizedek and how Christ fulfilled
[27:14] that in chapter eight this system of
[27:17] God's salvation and and how we've been
[27:18] introduced to a New Covenant the New
[27:21] Covenant of Christ's blood that Christ
[27:22] will actually live out his uh live out
[27:25] this Covenant in our lives and comparing
[27:27] that to the Earthly and the Heavenly
[27:29] Tabernacles and and in chapter 10 we're
[27:32] going to get into the life of God's
[27:34] salvation
[27:36] and look in chapter 11 at lives of that
[27:40] uh the saints that live by a life of
[27:42] Faith because Faith as we know is the
[27:44] evidence the evidence of things hoped
[27:46] for and we'll just stop there
[27:50] God bless you Saints
[27:54] [Applause]
