[9:16] wife putting forth all the effort she
[9:18] did in doing trying to get everything
[9:20] into the girls and you know uh Anna and
[9:24] Lisa and June to put it that way and the
[9:26] family part of it is for doing and to
[9:29] work and then all the others who had a
[9:31] hand in doing because we had a great
[9:33] time we we really had a good time you
[9:36] know laughing and talking and and all
[9:39] like that and we we get there we just
[9:41] kind of let our hair down and just you
[9:43] know and Richard stuck here straight up
[9:46] yesterday so we didn't know which way he
[9:48] was going but we we had a good time and
[9:51] we appreciate all of the doings of
[9:52] fixings and and everything and all of
[9:56] the things of you brothers and sisters
[9:58] that was doing it and then we had a good
[10:00] little group of of servers to serve us
[10:04] and we just sat around and just you know
[10:07] talk and just have a good time so we
[10:09] appreciate all of it all
[10:13] right we learned that a lot of us do not
[10:16] know very much about our
[10:20] wives and uh some of the wives don't
[10:23] know too much about their husbands
[10:25] either but uh you know I think boy and
[10:29] Janet come in
[10:30] last so you know no no it wouldn't we
[10:33] just can't but we did did have a good
[10:36] time in doing all of that but let's just
[10:39] pray the Lord would guide us and we'll
[10:41] keep doing it brother Joe will be making
[10:43] some things some videos of the things
[10:46] and if you want to watch it then you
[10:48] know maybe we can get it all kind of
[10:49] down into a thing and uh where you can
[10:53] view it and see and all like that so
[10:55] just just do that we appreciate it amen
[10:58] amen all right let's read our
[11:01] scriptures let's go right on into the
[11:03] word and then just try to get a thought
[11:06] across that the Lord would bless the
[11:08] reading of the word all right Hebrews
[11:13] 10:4 for it is not possible that the
[11:16] blood of bulls and goats should take
[11:17] away sins wherefore when he cometh into
[11:20] the world he sath sacrifice and
[11:22] offerings thou wouldest not in other
[11:24] words he' got fed up back there where
[11:26] this is relating back to it got fed up
[11:30] with it and he says your your sacrifice
[11:32] and offerings has become a stink in my
[11:35] nostrils but see then he's coming over
[11:37] here with Paul is relating back to that
[11:39] and he says something that really is
[11:41] fitting right he said sacrifice and
[11:43] offerings th would us
[11:45] not but a body thou Hast prepared me in
[11:48] burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin
[11:51] thou Hast had no
[11:53] pleasure then
[11:55] said I lo I come in the volume of the
[11:59] book it is written of
[12:01] me now it looks like he was sending
[12:03] somebody
[12:05] else when it would be talking about a
[12:07] body thou Hast prepared me looks like
[12:10] you know somebody else is coming but he
[12:13] brings it down to the eye lo I lo I come
[12:18] in the volume of the book it is written
[12:20] of me to do thy will oh God above when
[12:23] he said sacrific and offerings and burnt
[12:25] offerings and offering for sin thou
[12:27] would us not neither hath pleasure
[12:29] therein which are offered by the law
[12:32] then said he lo I come to do thy will oh
[12:35] God he taketh away the first it may he
[12:38] may establish the second all right let's
[12:40] go over to Ephesians
[12:45] 2 and we'll begin verse
[12:49] 19 now therefore you are no more
[12:52] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[12:54] citizens with the Saints and of the
[12:55] household of God and are built upon the
[12:58] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[13:01] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[13:03] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[13:05] fitly framed together groweth unto an
[13:09] Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye are
[13:12] in whom ye also are builded together for
[13:15] inhabitation of God through the spirit
[13:18] you may be seated the Lord had his
[13:20] Blessing to the reading of the
[13:23] word now we started a little series back
[13:29] about four Serv three services
[13:32] ago and talking
[13:35] about uh the prophets and what he was
[13:38] saying in the Masterpiece about a
[13:42] masterpiece
[13:43] family all right and uh we're covering a
[13:47] lot of things that he covered through
[13:50] there and I've asked you to read or or
[13:54] listen to the uh messages you know like
[13:57] the masterpiece the season not air with
[13:59] the shook uh even restoration of the
[14:02] Bride tree and all to where that you
[14:04] would know that what I'm
[14:07] saying is U what the prophet had to say
[14:11] I used to spend a lot of time putting up
[14:13] the quotes and we will call for some as
[14:15] we go along to be brought up but trying
[14:18] to do a little more in the line of just
[14:22] quoting things because you ought to be
[14:25] to the basis now that you can uh realize
[14:29] the message of the hour and as I'm
[14:31] saying we I'm going to cover a good many
[14:34] different what would be the word Avenues
[14:36] directions whatever you put it together
[14:40] of throughout those things to show that
[14:43] it all comes to showing one thing and
[14:47] that's the fall and the Regeneration of
[14:50] man and how God comes into being in a
[14:55] physical
[14:56] manifestation and how that it comes down
[14:59] all the way to where we are now we
[15:03] covered in one message there last
[15:06] Sunday uh we missed a couple of
[15:09] Wednesdays which is the first time we've
[15:10] ever missed two Wednesdays in a row
[15:13] because of the bad weather but we
[15:14] couldn't help it but last Sunday we were
[15:18] talking about and you might think it's
[15:20] odd to fit in the Masterpiece but we
[15:23] were talking about gifts and calling of
[15:26] God being without repentance
[15:29] all right and showing then that you
[15:33] know in God or in doings we tried to
[15:37] cover the point that uh there are gifts
[15:41] in the body of
[15:42] Christ you know non spiritual
[15:46] gifts and and those gifts are have to be
[15:50] judged even though they are gifts but
[15:53] they have to be judged that's right
[15:56] because they are in the basis and it is
[15:59] in the word that tells about them but
[16:01] they are regulated to where they have to
[16:03] be judged but not so with the prophets
[16:06] in with the fivefold ministry you don't
[16:09] have a regulation on that part that they
[16:12] have to be judged they are judged by
[16:15] whether the word they bring comes to
[16:18] pass or not all right and that way you
[16:20] don't just say h he's a preacher got to
[16:22] follow him no the prophet said if your
[16:25] pastor won't stay with the word what' he
[16:27] say get away from him that's the best
[16:29] way of saying it you know get away from
[16:31] him all right but see then that way you
[16:34] honor the gift amen and not the person
[16:38] but in those gifts that you know like
[16:40] the the five-fold ministry the prophets
[16:43] Etc that gift itself is
[16:46] predestinated eternally from God because
[16:49] it is the
[16:51] word Ephesians 4 talks about you know
[16:54] the fivefold ministry all right but now
[16:57] in the in the body of Christ in the nine
[17:01] spiritual gifts you are not regulated on
[17:04] the basis of things like you are with
[17:07] the five-fold ministry you get over into
[17:10] the the ministry and the prophets Etc
[17:13] and you find that there are regulations
[17:15] that they must be you know the husband
[17:18] one wife etc etc uh even over to a
[17:22] deacon but yet staying with the the
[17:24] gifts because it says that there are
[17:27] gifts and gifts
[17:29] are given for the perfecting of the
[17:32] Saints All right so then we we tried to
[17:34] go through that and showing the
[17:36] difference in it and bringing it down to
[17:39] where that we are but just remember as I
[17:41] said now the prophets don't have to
[17:44] stand before anybody the five-fold
[17:46] ministry doesn't they stand before God
[17:50] but the Bible says if a
[17:53] prophet even give you a sign and it come
[17:56] to pass but said if he takes you to
[17:58] another God what does it say get away
[18:02] from him it's not just a point of saying
[18:04] well I'm a preacher you got to follow me
[18:07] no Paul said follow me as I follow
[18:12] Christ all right the gift that was in
[18:15] Paul's life he said whereof I'm called
[18:18] amen all right then gifts and callings
[18:20] are without repentance it was there but
[18:24] yet we know that was not laying on of
[18:26] hands to get gifts that's Pentecostalism
[18:29] that doesn't work all right but when it
[18:33] comes down to the five-fold ministry
[18:36] then that five-fold Ministry is
[18:38] responsible for to God I answer to God
[18:42] not to you you know all right in that
[18:45] basis but then I turn back around and
[18:48] have to be your servant which means if I
[18:51] don't follow the word correctly then
[18:53] what do you
[18:54] do right go somewhere else that's the
[18:56] best way of saying it I mean that's way
[18:58] you ought to do just you get up and
[19:00] leave if the you know if if it's doing
[19:03] because that is doing it but remember
[19:06] honor the gift and God will honor you
[19:10] all right that goes in all of it I honor
[19:13] tongues interpretation
[19:15] Etc I'm not going to throw off on any of
[19:18] those things but I'm just going to watch
[19:21] it right so I honor the fivefold
[19:24] ministry you know and I watch
[19:27] that all right because if Paul said if
[19:31] somebody comes or either he come back
[19:33] himself again and said something
[19:35] different than what he did Galatians 1:
[19:36] 18 then let him be a cursed so it's not
[19:39] to just I said just say well I'm a
[19:41] preacher boy you got to take what I say
[19:44] don't check it with the word that's
[19:46] right we have the message now to be able
[19:49] to check whether anybody's telling the
[19:50] truth or not we don't have no arguments
[19:53] out of it we just follow it by that okay
[19:55] so that is the point that we were coming
[19:57] down to
[19:59] and trying to show it and as I said what
[20:02] I'm doing in this is trying to to just
[20:06] take different things and yet take and
[20:09] if you'll follow it you'll see what I'm
[20:12] talking about you'll see each message
[20:13] when it winds up to an end point that
[20:17] you can take it and just put it right in
[20:19] the other message and it'll follow right
[20:21] along it's all speaking about you and I
[20:25] in the basis of recognizing your day in
[20:27] its message
[20:28] okay wonderful we recognize the prophet
[20:31] we believe that God sent a prophet unto
[20:33] us you know to fulfill the scriptures
[20:35] but yet we know too that uh Luther had a
[20:39] message for his day but the people had
[20:41] to become what Luther said right it
[20:44] wasn't just to quote a message or talk
[20:46] about it or whatever because in that day
[20:49] they quoted Luther and went out and
[20:50] burnt churches you remember the history
[20:52] of it and then Luther said that well
[20:55] they said well that's what you wanted us
[20:57] to do he said I didn't say that I didn't
[21:01] teach to burn down the buildings what's
[21:03] the building got to do with
[21:05] it it was trying to get the people in
[21:08] the building converted all right but
[21:10] think about it
[21:13] now so what we're going to do today now
[21:16] is to try to talk
[21:18] about uh the scripture we just read of
[21:21] Hebrews 105 that a body thou Hast
[21:26] prepared me all right
[21:28] now in doing that I want you to think
[21:32] about it as we covered it in the message
[21:35] that the prophet of God on the
[21:37] Masterpiece covers that
[21:40] the prophets that the the foundation
[21:43] that just was put on was uh Abraham
[21:47] Isaac Jacob and Joseph you know and then
[21:50] the prophets built the body which was
[21:53] the word see not to Patriarchs they were
[21:57] only the Foundation part but the
[22:00] prophets built the body which was the
[22:03] word and then the head to that body came
[22:06] which was Jesus Christ all right the
[22:08] last one to do was John the Baptist in
[22:12] the spirit and the power of el under
[22:15] Malachi 3 that was to come and introduce
[22:18] the head right all right and he done
[22:21] that part all right then that would
[22:24] would cover you know uh of where the
[22:28] that you would be going all right then
[22:30] what we want to do this morning now is
[22:32] to take something and kind of think
[22:35] about it that a body thou Hast built me
[22:40] all right now see everybody wants to say
[22:43] well that was Jesus that's right amen we
[22:45] believe that but he says on the message
[22:48] of this day the scripture is fulfilled
[22:51] he
[22:52] says scripture has a compound meaning to
[22:56] it and a compound
[23:00] Revelation all right so what speaks as
[23:03] we will get to in another message about
[23:05] two more down what speaks of the
[23:09] bridegroom will speak of the
[23:11] Bride okay so in Isaiah there uh
[23:16] 53 when it gets down to talking about
[23:19] how he was smitten the prophet says the
[23:20] bride is smitten if you've listened to
[23:22] what I've asked you to to go through and
[23:24] do all right but trying to see the day
[23:27] that we're living
[23:29] in amen then most people say that to
[23:32] recognize this day is a set of on go
[23:34] it's just to recognize brother randam
[23:36] was a
[23:36] prophet well all right that's
[23:39] wonderful but just
[23:42] remember in the days of the times of the
[23:47] prophets as they were speaking a people
[23:50] made manifest what was being spoken
[23:54] right all right so now somebody has to
[23:58] come along to make that message live and
[24:01] I wasn't the one that wrote the book
[24:03] about it I just try to read it and I
[24:06] wasn't the one who brought this message
[24:09] but in the Masterpiece the prophet said
[24:11] the bride is to
[24:14] vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[24:18] Revelations 10:7 Etc all right now you
[24:22] mean that we are to vindicate when he's
[24:25] already been Vindicated is a point of
[24:27] saying you know if I'm right let God
[24:30] come down and heal the sick he raised
[24:33] the dead and uh demons were cast out all
[24:36] kind of things happen to prove that he
[24:38] had the sign of the son of man which is
[24:42] a resurrection sign right in this last
[24:45] day Prophet
[24:46] amen but then why would brother randam
[24:48] say the bride is to vindicate that's it
[24:53] amen so that means there's something
[24:55] left for her right
[24:58] and as I said there's always got to be a
[25:01] people to make the message alive right
[25:05] Luther was preaching the just shall live
[25:07] by faith but the people had to make that
[25:09] alive because he could not have of uh
[25:12] done as he done unless somebody helped
[25:15] him you know and done what he was saying
[25:17] Wesley brought sanctification but yet
[25:20] still he not by himself the zeusa street
[25:24] came in with the gifts all right that
[25:28] was wonderful we believe in all of that
[25:30] because it's the word of God Amen it's
[25:33] the restoration of the brid tree all
[25:36] right and in doing that then there must
[25:39] be a people to make this message live
[25:44] and I've done been through in the
[25:45] message a couple prior to where brother
[25:47] Brandon was covering it that the bride
[25:50] would be the word made
[25:53] flesh now who is that ask John 1:14
[25:57] right right right amen speaking of Jesus
[26:00] Christ amen and the Word was made flesh
[26:02] and dwelt among us all right but it
[26:04] means in the end time to be in a
[26:06] bride because there's not a physical
[26:09] coming in the end time of Christ to the
[26:14] church we meet him in the air the
[26:17] physical coming is the millennial Reign
[26:20] you know when you can see him physically
[26:22] we meet him in the air we're going to
[26:24] leave here in a Rapture and go meet him
[26:26] in the air because he doesn't come to
[26:29] Earth in a COR Corporal body you know
[26:32] why because we're his body right right
[26:35] right that's
[26:37] simple people say brother Dale is so
[26:39] deep I don't see how in the world that
[26:40] could be deep that's just so simple I
[26:43] mean it's just Simplicity I'm just
[26:44] saying what the prophet had to
[26:46] say then why don't you call him deep
[26:49] yeah
[26:51] yeah but see Church the prophets built
[26:55] the
[26:56] body
[26:59] all right and you can't leave out any of
[27:02] those little bitty Minor
[27:04] Prophets he had his place but neither
[27:07] can you put in the book of
[27:11] mbes Aggie's
[27:14] Purgatory um what is the second book of
[27:17] Daniel or something there is a a doing
[27:19] in there you can't put those
[27:21] in why because look what kind of a body
[27:25] you'd
[27:26] have
[27:28] see if you came up with some of those
[27:30] things that were there that you know was
[27:34] claimed to be written back
[27:36] there but if you put it in you got
[27:39] fungus growing out somewhere you might
[27:41] have him standing with his arms in his
[27:44] his body and his torsos or what you call
[27:46] it the body part legs everything play
[27:48] and then all at once you got some kind
[27:50] of a a growth going off of it well that
[27:52] wouldn't be the body of Christ so those
[27:55] things were not would not pan up with
[27:58] the rest of the scriptures right and
[28:00] that was the reason they were left
[28:02] out because it would have not been a
[28:05] building a body do you understand what
[28:07] I'm saying I mean that's that's a a
[28:09] wonderful thought or
[28:12] illustration is that you you can't add
[28:14] anything to it all right so when we get
[28:16] into the church ages a little bit today
[28:19] but when we get into the church ages in
[28:22] the next few messages and think about it
[28:25] too that you can't have just
[28:28] denominations here and denominations
[28:30] there and this here and that there and
[28:32] over there and just you know
[28:36] right because that's what we're going to
[28:38] talk
[28:39] about we're going to talk about Hebrews
[28:44] 10:5 what a body thou Hast prepared
[28:49] me you realize as the B as the Bride of
[28:52] Jesus Christ that we are his body
[28:56] amen members in particular as Paul would
[28:59] call it you know he's the
[29:02] head we don't claim to be the
[29:05] head we're not something different we're
[29:08] not all we are is just a part of the
[29:11] body of
[29:12] Christ all right and in that see then we
[29:15] can see it's easily to understand why
[29:17] brother brandom as I said the other day
[29:19] on that point
[29:21] that you know the dream or Vision or
[29:24] what it was they told Brother brandom
[29:25] the GU did said do it and in that it was
[29:28] spoken and said you've been given more
[29:30] gifts and thanks well why well he
[29:34] because he to end it all up well that's
[29:36] good that's that's all right but just
[29:39] remember there was no
[29:42] Prophet had the baptism of the Holy
[29:46] Ghost the New
[29:48] Birth the way I said it all right John
[29:52] was born with the holy ghost from his
[29:54] mother's wound but he was not in the
[29:56] body of Christ
[29:57] now come on that's scripture we that's
[29:59] not something that has to be played with
[30:01] that's scripture am the kingdom never
[30:03] started until the book of Acts right
[30:06] amen all
[30:08] right and see the great of of John being
[30:11] there and it said he was full of the
[30:13] Holy Ghost but why don't we go over
[30:14] there and say like it says about
[30:16] Elizabeth was full of the Holy Ghost we
[30:18] don't want to quote that there's another
[30:20] one Mary or one other of they say said
[30:22] they were full of the Holy
[30:24] Ghost well
[30:26] amen John was full of the Holy Ghost
[30:29] from his mother's womb when Mary spoke
[30:31] the word and said his name would be
[30:33] Jesus John came
[30:36] alive all right but he was not a born
[30:40] again believer that's why Jesus says the
[30:43] least in the
[30:45] kingdom is
[30:48] what greater than John
[30:52] amen is that Bible amen why don't we
[30:56] believe it that way amen least in the
[30:59] Kingdom least in the Born Again believer
[31:01] yes why John and him had an anointing
[31:04] David had an anointing he had all those
[31:06] things but yet look what he'd do he said
[31:10] where he said return un to me the joy of
[31:12] thy salvation Scofield even says it
[31:14] brother Brandon may have been quoting
[31:15] from him but he says he said David was
[31:18] on his way home from the bed with basba
[31:21] when he wrote
[31:23] that I don't feelit too good today does
[31:26] it you
[31:30] know but
[31:32] listen the prophets built the body which
[31:35] was the word of each age they were
[31:38] living
[31:39] in the last one to come was
[31:43] John of Malachi 3 to come to introduce
[31:47] The
[31:48] Headstone which was
[31:51] Christ we'll get down to a quote in a
[31:53] minute where the Prophet said this in
[31:55] the end time where we're at is the
[31:57] introducing of The
[31:59] Headstone but is it odd how everything
[32:01] fits so perfectly together that you had
[32:05] the prophets to be you had Abraham Isaac
[32:07] Jacob and Joseph to build a foundation
[32:10] and then you had the prophets to build a
[32:12] body and you had the last one which was
[32:14] John the Baptist to introduce Jesus
[32:16] Christ and who was he right in the
[32:19] beginning was the word and the Word was
[32:20] with God and the Word was God right amen
[32:23] so he introduced the word right well
[32:25] isn't it odd in the life days or how
[32:27] it's done the Bible says we'll get back
[32:29] to it later we build on the foundation
[32:31] Apostles and Prophets right so this New
[32:34] Testament is setting on a wonderful
[32:36] Foundation all
[32:38] right but then the ages is going to
[32:42] build a
[32:43] body and the last one to come in the
[32:45] Ages was what Malachi 4 through brother
[32:49] random right to what to introduce the
[32:52] word yes amen right the headstone and
[32:57] that that's so marvelous to me and see
[33:01] John introduced Christ which brought in
[33:04] the New
[33:06] Testament right brother brandom
[33:09] introduces Christ which will bring in
[33:11] the Millennium right all right I'm just
[33:14] stating these things we'll get back to
[33:15] them later but you'll see that each one
[33:17] of these things I'm talking about and
[33:20] using it it brings it to a place of
[33:23] expressing these things to us because it
[33:27] is a compound meaning and a compound
[33:29] Revelation what speaks of him speaks of
[33:31] you right that's right well that's just
[33:35] a little bit too much brother Dale you
[33:36] can't you may well I didn't say it yeah
[33:40] so don't blame me you blame the prophet
[33:42] he's one said
[33:44] it he's the one who said it was a
[33:46] compound Revelation amen all right
[33:50] now see now as the Old Testament gave
[33:53] birth to Jesus Christ the word
[33:59] which was a
[34:01] temple for God to dwell in because
[34:04] sacrifice and
[34:05] offering had become a stink in his
[34:07] nostrils that's right and then it was
[34:10] necessary that he step down in human
[34:16] flesh y amen right to where he could die
[34:20] pay the price right come forth forgive
[34:24] our
[34:25] sins right give the new birth and the
[34:27] things and watch after a while if we get
[34:30] time this morning if we don't was this
[34:31] evening where brother brandham says
[34:37] that he's a body he's got a body today
[34:40] and he's talking to person in a prayer
[34:42] line he said that's the
[34:45] reason you're bringing the baby to
[34:50] me
[34:52] sure amen come on that's what he said he
[34:56] said you're bringing the baby to me he
[34:58] said because he don't have a body here
[35:01] right but said we're his body right all
[35:04] right but he just try to get you to
[35:06] recognize who you are amen now this is
[35:10] not new for me folks and anybody's been
[35:13] around has been around long enough to
[35:15] know this is what I was preaching in
[35:20] 1970 and the other day I come right back
[35:22] to a place where in
[35:24] 1969 in Athens Georgia over the first
[35:26] sermon I preached in this message which
[35:28] is not bragging but just telling you how
[35:31] the Holy Spirit can keep it lined up the
[35:34] first message I preached was the Bride
[35:36] of Jesus Christ was the son of man
[35:42] amen and she was be the fullness of the
[35:45] godhead
[35:47] bodily of course a man that begin
[35:50] preaching about in the 80s about the son
[35:52] of man everybody flocked to
[35:54] it but to show you how far he went he
[35:57] said you say the fullness of the godhead
[35:59] bodily he said that's
[36:01] hogwash that's what he
[36:04] said cuz he said the third pool is only
[36:06] for brother brandham and Jesus
[36:08] Christ now that's not according to what
[36:10] the prophet said no so I don't care what
[36:14] his name is am right or who he
[36:17] is I just tell it like it is and they're
[36:20] not bragging amen why can't I tell it
[36:24] that's right see people think I'm
[36:26] exalted because I said in
[36:27] 1974 that we could pass the year 2026
[36:31] and not break brother R's messy but
[36:32] nobody wants to know how come I preet in
[36:38] 1974 but you know we're closely getting
[36:40] to that
[36:44] age but all of these were their
[36:46] predictions were very
[36:48] popular got to be done got to be done by
[36:51] 73 and I got to be done by
[36:53] 77 I didn't want it to come where it is
[36:56] now
[36:57] but it ain't bothering me none
[37:00] whatsoever I didn't want that earthquake
[37:02] to happen that I felt the other night
[37:04] and some of you may be felt it the
[37:06] struck over in South
[37:07] Carolina
[37:09] 4.1 but the prophet said there'll be
[37:12] after a series of earthquakes well we
[37:14] don't have too many here in
[37:16] Georgia but that took place and I felt
[37:19] it I seen the water sitting on
[37:21] the I had a a bottle of water I looked
[37:25] over at Nanny to see if she was was
[37:26] recognizing something and and the water
[37:29] was just floating in that in that thing
[37:33] in a few minutes the phone rang and
[37:35] people begin to tell what was going
[37:37] on after a series of prophet said of
[37:41] earthquakes they're getting greater
[37:42] aren't they that's right I wouldn't have
[37:44] one it said that he
[37:46] did but I believe it don't you all right
[37:49] now let's get into
[37:51] it see Hebrews 10:5 then would be
[37:55] speaking of a
[37:57] bride that would have to bring forth the
[38:01] the word in the last days to be United
[38:06] with Christ in the
[38:08] resurrection a body of what he calls it
[38:13] a body of
[38:16] Believers a body of
[38:18] Believers that's on return in Jubilee
[38:22] 1962 sacrifice and offering th would
[38:24] have not but a body thou Hast prepared
[38:25] me a body of
[38:28] Believers a body that's been born right
[38:33] y right a body of Believers he goes on
[38:37] what house will you build me he says and
[38:39] Earth is my foot stol and where is the
[38:41] place of my rest but a body thou Hast
[38:43] prepared me and we are the body of
[38:46] Christ amen
[38:49] right stature of a perfect man what does
[38:52] he say a body thou Hast prepared me God
[38:56] dwell in the stature of a man reflecting
[38:59] himself into that being perfect Worship
[39:02] in God being the Tabernacle God
[39:05] manifesting himself the statue of a
[39:08] perfect man is not the stature of me and
[39:10] you it is the stature of Jesus
[39:13] Christ in you and I it's not done statue
[39:17] of a perfect man he says God walking in
[39:20] two feet in
[39:23] you in you
[39:27] a
[39:30] body but as I said while ago now
[39:32] remember what made brother bradam so
[39:35] great was he was a member of the body of
[39:39] Christ whereas the other prophets of the
[39:42] Old Testament were
[39:44] not and they there used to be some
[39:46] people right over here not too far from
[39:48] us that their Doctrine was that brother
[39:50] random Was An Old Testament prophet in a
[39:53] new testament age that's right
[39:57] you ever heard that one you know what I
[39:59] told him I said then he's a law
[40:03] teacher now come
[40:06] on he's a law
[40:10] teacher right but see the oh but that's
[40:13] just my way of seeing it
[40:17] okay but it's my way of saying I don't
[40:19] believe
[40:20] it
[40:22] that's all right because I'm looking at
[40:25] it from the the form of seeing
[40:28] what God dwelling in the stature of a
[40:31] perfect man in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[40:34] because we are his body amen and he
[40:37] doesn't have a body now on Earth because
[40:39] we're his body that's right you would
[40:41] mess up all of the scriptures
[40:44] yes you know you don't have any
[40:46] scriptures but I I what I believe well
[40:49] okay believe what you want
[40:53] to but when it comes down to the word
[40:56] don't get upset with me because I expose
[40:59] it
[41:01] right message of dedication 1962 he said
[41:05] how beautiful Hebrews 10:5 but a body
[41:08] thou Hast prepared me showing that God
[41:10] was going to dwell in a body right okay
[41:14] prepared me and when this body had been
[41:18] made a sacrifice so now who's he talking
[41:20] about Jesus
[41:22] Christ the correct lamb had been
[41:25] sacrificed
[41:27] there was coming forth then God came to
[41:31] his own body which was his bride
[41:40] right so no no he came
[41:43] to you're not getting it he came back
[41:47] there in flesh but the one that came
[41:49] back there in flesh is to come in the
[41:51] bride amen all right and when I talk
[41:55] about the the bride be in the fullness
[41:57] of the godhead bodily I'm not just
[41:59] talking about Lula
[42:02] Georgia neither am I talking about lady
[42:05] oia I'm talking about seven Church
[42:09] ages that's right is the fullest of the
[42:12] godhead bodily you can't leave them out
[42:14] of it they're a part of it that's where
[42:18] the problem has been with the people
[42:20] they want to say like Luther didn't have
[42:22] nothing West didn't have Zeus didn't
[42:23] have
[42:25] nothing well you take some wheat and you
[42:27] plant it and it comes up and about the
[42:30] time you see that head just go out there
[42:31] and cut it
[42:33] down that's what you're doing and you
[42:36] just let that seed fall on the ground
[42:38] what's it going to
[42:40] do it's going to
[42:43] right cuz we don't have no carriers no
[42:45] holders we'll get to that this
[42:48] evening we are the body of
[42:52] Christ for Heaven is my throne and Earth
[42:55] is my foot stol
[42:57] and where is the place of my
[43:02] rest in the bride of Christ
[43:06] amen in the bride of Christ down through
[43:09] seven Church
[43:10] ages all
[43:12] right listen what he's saying not a
[43:16] building still on that dedication we
[43:18] were talking about when he says there
[43:21] had
[43:22] been 120 temples that God had was
[43:27] created had created was ready for
[43:35] dedication had all their unbelief beat
[43:37] out of
[43:39] them yeah he said and not God don't
[43:42] dwell in a building God dwells in the
[43:45] heart of his
[43:47] people he finds rest he
[43:50] said in his
[43:53] people so the bride down Through the
[43:55] Ages had been the
[43:59] body
[44:01] right so Hebrews 10:5 is speaking of the
[44:04] Bride as well as speaking of the groom
[44:09] right has the Lord spoken only to Moses
[44:12] he says and we are his
[44:17] body that's the one when he's he's in
[44:19] the prayer line he's talking about the
[44:21] little bringing you take your your baby
[44:23] there well then C he's his body has been
[44:27] received up into heaven speaking of
[44:28] Christ but his spirit is here and we are
[44:31] his body now and that's the reason you
[44:34] brought her to
[44:38] me why
[44:41] because he was a part of the body
[44:44] right
[44:46] right this Prophet was part of the body
[44:49] of Christ that's why he was greater than
[44:51] all of the
[44:53] prophets he was a born again believer
[44:59] and when he were talking about the bride
[45:01] must have the same Ministry we can see
[45:04] it in
[45:06] him all right well I just don't see
[45:09] nothing going on
[45:12] well if you'd have been here when Jesus
[45:14] was here you'd have said the same thing
[45:16] and if you'd have been here when brother
[45:18] randam was on the earth you'd have been
[45:19] like the rest of
[45:21] them that when he challenged them 300
[45:24] ministers no yes they all got
[45:26] yeah we want the tapes we're going to
[45:28] take it to our churches he said not one
[45:32] of them came
[45:37] back so it evidently didn't believe
[45:40] it but listen spok of word's Original
[45:44] Seed Christ is the head the True Stone
[45:47] of God do you believe that the
[45:49] congregation says amen the true word the
[45:51] bride is the body he said you want some
[45:55] scriptures for
[45:58] that 1 Peter 2 and
[46:01] 1 what is that like a holy priesthood
[46:05] right Ephesians 5 and22 where we read is
[46:11] what word which is the
[46:14] body see we are the body of
[46:18] Christ he doesn't need another body
[46:20] right now it would mess up
[46:22] everything he says on the Seal of God
[46:25] 1954
[46:26] God dwells in human hearts what a body
[46:29] thou Hast prepared me the Holy Ghost
[46:30] don't dwell in the house it dwells in
[46:32] the heart that's the temple amen you
[46:36] know now that you're the Temple of the
[46:39] Living
[46:40] God Amen build a temple build a build a
[46:46] church and all your faith is buildt
[46:49] around your temple or your church that's
[46:52] what he's saying yours is built around
[46:54] what you got it's made out of w would
[46:57] perseverance 62 how be it the most high
[47:00] don't dwell in houses made with hands
[47:02] but a body thou has prepared me now God
[47:05] prepared himself a body in the form of
[47:07] the Lord Jesus which was the Christ
[47:10] meaning the anointed one and all that
[47:13] God
[47:15] was
[47:18] listen was in Christ he was the fullness
[47:21] of the godhead bodily then what that's
[47:24] what the scripture says now all that God
[47:27] was he poured into poured out in Christ
[47:32] he was Emmanuel God With Us and all that
[47:35] Christ was he poured out into his church
[47:38] the anointed ones to continue his work
[47:41] that his word might be might live con
[47:45] constantly you see what I'm talking
[47:49] about what speaks of him speaks to you
[47:51] and I that's right restoration of the
[47:54] brid tree God sent the Holy Spirit life
[47:57] of God to be in you not in a
[48:00] statue you are the guy that God wants to
[48:04] live in not a statue but in you people
[48:07] call Holy statues there ain't no holy
[48:10] statues you are God's holy statue that's
[48:14] the Bible says that's right a body thou
[48:17] has prepared
[48:20] me when he gets over to the
[48:22] Philadelphian Church age look what he
[48:24] says
[48:26] and he's not only giving crowns this is
[48:28] 315 Church age books what it actually is
[48:32] the bride will be made pillars in the
[48:34] temple of
[48:35] God but what is the temple of God Jesus
[48:38] spoke of his body as being the temple it
[48:41] was it was the temple of God but now
[48:45] that we are his body the true church is
[48:48] the temple of God by the Holy Ghost
[48:50] within us and he's going to make the
[48:52] Overcomer a pillar in that Temple that's
[48:55] right
[48:57] what are he going to
[48:59] say and God puts a man in the temple as
[49:03] a pillar and makes him part of that
[49:06] Foundation group what is he doing he's
[49:10] giving him the revelation of the word of
[49:13] himself because that exact that's
[49:15] exactly what the apostles and Prophets
[49:18] had so we're build on the foundation
[49:20] Apostles and
[49:22] Prophets well brother d i i i I just
[49:25] check out what the prophet is saying by
[49:27] where how my spirit is you
[49:32] know one man years ago had it wrote on a
[49:35] marriage and divorce book and he said I
[49:39] want to ask what I would love for
[49:41] brother brownon something to degree to
[49:42] be here now where I could ask him these
[49:49] questions he might to state from here so
[49:51] I'm going to make his
[49:53] statement he said the Lord spoke to to
[49:55] him one day and he said are you going to
[49:58] believe your ideas and thoughts or are
[50:00] you going to take what my Prophet said I
[50:03] believe God spoke to
[50:04] him it's your fits don't
[50:08] it are you going to believe your ideas
[50:11] yeah but I think it's just way what
[50:13] right do we have to think what does the
[50:16] Bible say why don't we check the
[50:18] prophet's message with the
[50:20] Bible why don't we check the Bible with
[50:23] the prophet's message right I any
[50:26] problem God don't get mad at nobody for
[50:28] checking out his word that's
[50:31] right come on he revealed something to
[50:34] brother
[50:35] brandham and he said I'd spend the rest
[50:37] of the day checking it out what checking
[50:41] it out God spoke to
[50:45] him he said but I'd spend the rest of
[50:47] the day checking it out why to see
[50:49] whether it was right in the
[50:51] word a lot of
[50:54] voices speaking of a lot of things yeah
[50:57] but the Lord told
[51:00] me you remember where we were at when
[51:03] we're talking about the gifts and
[51:04] calling of God without repentance
[51:07] remember you can have a gift of Prophecy
[51:10] or speak just one time and never be used
[51:12] again because it will go from one person
[51:15] to another you remember
[51:17] that but yet you don't call a person a
[51:20] prophet just because they
[51:24] prophesy
[51:25] right right you know well that's a
[51:28] prophet he
[51:30] prophesied
[51:33] well what does he do with the rest of it
[51:36] right
[51:37] amen but you see we're built upon the
[51:39] foundation of the Apostles and
[51:43] Prophets Paul said about the foundation
[51:48] back there in the first church age he
[51:50] was talking to the Ephesians and then he
[51:53] reads the scripture built upon the found
[51:55] foundation of the Prophet Apostles and
[51:57] Prophets Luther no Baptist no no build
[52:01] on the foundation in other
[52:05] words make him a
[52:08] pillar in other words part of the
[52:12] foundation what will I give him
[52:15] Philadelphian Church age 1960
[52:19] 1210 what will I give him I put him in
[52:23] the doctrine of the Apostles and
[52:25] prophets from the beginning and give him
[52:28] the
[52:29] Revelation what's the prophet say about
[52:32] him he's counselor Prince of Peace
[52:35] Mighty God Everlasting father I'll put
[52:38] him back in the foundation of my
[52:41] word in the house of God oh my I'll put
[52:46] him right there in that pillar in the
[52:48] foundation where you stay right in the
[52:50] word he said I like that brother don't
[52:52] you
[52:54] right
[52:55] you see if we get something that is
[52:57] contrary to the Old
[53:03] Testament are you following my thought
[53:05] now something contrary to the Old
[53:11] Testament does it not say that we're
[53:13] built on the foundation of
[53:17] Apostles and
[53:22] Prophets is that the scripture amen
[53:26] it
[53:27] stipulates I know word an can be
[53:29] translated even so even the prophets
[53:31] amen go
[53:32] ahead but just remember Peter and them
[53:35] couldn't bring anything contrary to the
[53:39] Old Testament
[53:41] prophets they built upon what they were
[53:45] saying that's right amen Paul set in
[53:48] order the Old Testament scriptures until
[53:52] he being the only one that was chosen to
[53:54] write like like that Etc so much and was
[53:57] not even a personal witness to Jesus
[54:00] Christ right but yet no one in all of
[54:03] that of doing of the writings of the
[54:07] Apostles Peter James John
[54:10] Etc did any of them explain
[54:16] communion and yet the Apostle Paul was
[54:18] chosen to explain the communion in the
[54:20] Corinthians
[54:23] right why because he took that Old
[54:25] Testament
[54:28] scriptures what did the prophet say it
[54:30] he said he went for what 3 years back
[54:32] there and wouldn't even preach or
[54:33] nothing
[54:35] until I know one time you can use 14 the
[54:37] other time you use
[54:40] three he said he was checking out to see
[54:43] whether what spoke to him was what was
[54:47] back there amen and remember what he
[54:51] said the surprise was not the pillar of
[54:54] fire strike anymore came
[54:55] down he knew about that he knew about
[54:59] the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[55:01] the pillar of fire and the Moses and the
[55:04] stories but when that Pillar of Fire
[55:07] said I'm Jesus that's it whom thou
[55:11] persecute us and Paul never did
[55:12] persecute Jesus is no record but he was
[55:15] persecuting the
[55:17] Christians that Christ was living in but
[55:19] Paul is relating it he
[55:22] says he is the Jehovah the old and Jesus
[55:27] of the new right that's right
[55:30] amen you said well Paul no I know Paul
[55:32] never said it that way that was brother
[55:34] brandham because he was bringing what
[55:36] Paul
[55:38] said but you see we lost down to the
[55:41] ages of the revelation of the original
[55:44] uh
[55:46] Apostles you know right that they were
[55:48] built upon what the prophets had said
[55:51] and they were prophets in the New
[55:52] Testament yes aabus Etc different ones
[55:55] sure John was counted as a being a
[55:57] prophet there were many of them that
[55:58] were counted but those are in fold
[56:00] Ministry
[56:01] prophets but then we're promised in the
[56:03] last days that God would send us a
[56:05] prophet amen not an Old Testament
[56:09] Prophet that's
[56:12] right no you just stay with law teaching
[56:14] if you done that he'd turn you cuz
[56:16] that's why people can't understand uh
[56:18] brother randam coming because they think
[56:20] melachi 3 is in the world will agree
[56:22] that melachi 3 is is John the this
[56:27] y I mean they'll go along with that Luke
[56:29] 1:17 you know they'll go along with
[56:33] that that it was John the Baptist but
[56:35] then when they come to Malachi 4 they
[56:37] say yeah but but he turned us right
[56:40] back and you remember what the prophet
[56:42] said John turned us to the New Testament
[56:44] message which was Christ he said because
[56:47] if he turned us back he turns back under
[56:48] the law
[56:51] amen that's the way your Prophet said it
[56:54] would be
[56:56] but what do we
[56:58] believe it can't be any different in the
[57:00] Old Testament and New Testament in
[57:01] revealing
[57:03] God why brother Rand would say he said
[57:05] how many gods did they have back there
[57:07] he said they had one he said how many
[57:09] gods does a bride have he said one
[57:13] amen one
[57:15] God all she's got amen not a trinity not
[57:19] thoughts no right he said you go to your
[57:22] Jews with it and tell them about that he
[57:24] said they tell you right quick where
[57:26] that come from yep he said because they
[57:28] know the history right of the Catholic
[57:31] church and where it come from you know
[57:32] of the
[57:34] Trinity but are you following me a body
[57:36] thou Hast prepared
[57:38] me so he's not going to just make a in
[57:41] the last days start back over it was put
[57:45] there as the apostles and Prophets right
[57:48] be the foundation and then the church AE
[57:53] Messengers would be the body all right
[57:57] and that way you can't leave anything
[57:59] out of
[58:00] it you can't leave out one of those
[58:06] ages but you see just because Luther
[58:08] smoked a pipe and sat in a pub and drank
[58:11] beer which we'd be totally against amen
[58:15] but yet the message he brought us is
[58:17] just shall live by faith I believe it
[58:21] right that's right his action and
[58:25] reactions might have been different
[58:27] because nobody was there to judge him
[58:29] and tell
[58:30] him well because he was under the
[58:33] Catholic church and their ways he didn't
[58:35] want to leave the Catholic church I've
[58:37] read his own writings he wanted to
[58:39] convert the
[58:43] church and he tried to convert it with
[58:45] ways were doing it it turned out to be
[58:47] why it's called Reformation
[58:50] Right Wesley sanctification is called
[58:53] Reformation
[58:57] why because we're trying to reform
[58:59] yes that's it we're not to deal with
[59:03] reforming
[59:05] see we're to deal with the word of the
[59:09] Lord so you and I the one God we have is
[59:12] the same Foundation that Paul was laying
[59:15] Peter was
[59:18] laying right
[59:21] right the same one God that John spoke
[59:24] of we speak of today yes the same one
[59:26] Luther I mean Luke said I really like to
[59:30] read the book of
[59:31] Luke you remember when he comes over he
[59:33] represents a man in the the ages and
[59:35] comes through with Luke Matthew Mark
[59:37] Luke and John and I love to read his
[59:39] writings you know why Luke never he was
[59:42] not an original disciple
[59:45] right come on no he didn't come along to
[59:48] Paul all right but Luke read what he
[59:52] says in the beginning he said having
[59:55] perfect
[59:58] understanding now none of the other
[1:00:00] Apostles right Matthew didn't say that
[1:00:03] Mark didn't say it John didn't say it
[1:00:06] but Luke the guy that was not even there
[1:00:09] when Jesus you know went with him and
[1:00:11] going he was writing of accounts that's
[1:00:15] right that other people told
[1:00:19] him but I don't think you could have
[1:00:21] pull some book of mccabes over on Luke
[1:00:23] do you some kind of a second book of
[1:00:26] Daniel or Aggie's purgatories or
[1:00:29] something you know right
[1:00:31] no he Luke at having perfect
[1:00:36] understanding the Holy Spirit spoke to
[1:00:38] the man and would say that's not right
[1:00:42] leave that
[1:00:43] out and look what he was coming Luke was
[1:00:46] a physician you know and he was with
[1:00:47] Paul at a wonderful way of traveling
[1:00:49] didn't he how about traveling alone with
[1:00:52] a
[1:00:53] guy
[1:00:55] like
[1:00:59] Paul that would write the basis of the
[1:01:02] New
[1:01:03] Testament you know more writings than
[1:01:06] any of them do you see what I'm talking
[1:01:10] about what we're talking about
[1:01:13] today is already been written in the
[1:01:16] word of God
[1:01:20] am yeah but but but we're in another age
[1:01:23] now
[1:01:27] were people say brother Brandon was even
[1:01:30] in another age but we're in another age
[1:01:32] now we're in the bride age there was
[1:01:34] bride age never a church age there was a
[1:01:37] bride never Church age so there's bride
[1:01:39] age never Church
[1:01:41] age
[1:01:43] right but yet we've gone beyond the
[1:01:46] prophet is what I had a man tell me I
[1:01:49] said well you need to First tell me what
[1:01:52] he
[1:01:53] said right and then we'll talk
[1:01:56] about what you're talking about he was
[1:01:58] sitting in my home you know and I
[1:02:01] finally told him I said why don't you
[1:02:02] either get in the message or get
[1:02:05] out and his wife looked at me and said
[1:02:08] brother Dale you're exactly
[1:02:11] right he needs to get in or get
[1:02:14] out he said but we we go beyond that he
[1:02:18] just laid the
[1:02:21] foundation is it
[1:02:23] okay
[1:02:25] I'm known for being a smart
[1:02:27] elic I'll accept being an elic but I
[1:02:29] ain't too
[1:02:31] smart but I said brother would you mind
[1:02:34] telling me what the seven Thunders are
[1:02:35] that's just what I ask
[1:02:38] him cuz see I knew how to trap
[1:02:43] him well he finally looked at me and he
[1:02:45] said you're the teacher why don't you
[1:02:47] tell me what it is I said even if I told
[1:02:49] you you wouldn't know what it is cu it
[1:02:50] got to be revealed to
[1:02:52] you and it certainly won't fit into your
[1:02:55] doctrine that you are to build a
[1:03:00] body well brother there you're talking
[1:03:02] about the ages built right sure and we
[1:03:06] don't need nobody to build a feet we
[1:03:08] don't need nobody to build a the loins
[1:03:11] we don't need nobody to build the legs
[1:03:14] we don't need nobody to build the chest
[1:03:16] we don't need nobody to build the
[1:03:20] arms
[1:03:23] right
[1:03:24] and we've already had the one to come to
[1:03:26] introduce the head right so we're not
[1:03:30] looking for somebody else to come to
[1:03:32] straighten this thing out right
[1:03:37] right he was either the prophet or you
[1:03:41] and I got a lot of
[1:03:43] problems all right you see I don't have
[1:03:46] no no Swiss bank account just in case
[1:03:49] this thing goes
[1:03:51] wrong you know I don't have no the old
[1:03:55] saying goes you know in financial world
[1:03:56] don't put all your eggs in the same
[1:03:58] basket cuz you can lose you know but in
[1:04:01] the Christian real you better get them
[1:04:02] all in the same
[1:04:06] basket right right CU if not you're
[1:04:08] trying to hold over something else okay
[1:04:12] now think about it John the Baptist was
[1:04:15] the one who come to
[1:04:19] introduce Jesus Christ S as we would see
[1:04:23] Jesus
[1:04:24] being the greatest prophet of all the
[1:04:27] Ages was John the
[1:04:29] Baptist and Jesus said so Vindicated him
[1:04:34] as the
[1:04:35] greatest greater than Elijah greater
[1:04:38] than any other rest of them was John
[1:04:42] because he introduced the
[1:04:45] Messiah the rest of
[1:04:48] them prophesied of his
[1:04:52] coming amen
[1:04:54] do you need that and pull it up pull up
[1:04:56] number
[1:04:57] 16 so where you can read
[1:05:00] it sir as we would see Jesus
[1:05:04] 1957 paragraph e37 look what he
[1:05:10] says as soon as he entered his Min John
[1:05:12] the Baptist one who introduced him being
[1:05:14] the greatest prophet of all the Ages was
[1:05:15] John the Baptist and Jesus said so
[1:05:17] Vindicated him as the greatest greater
[1:05:19] than Elijah greater than any of the rest
[1:05:21] of them was John because he introduced
[1:05:24] Messiah the rest of them prophesied of
[1:05:26] his
[1:05:30] coming all
[1:05:32] right but he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:05:34] that takes away the sin of the
[1:05:38] world he had the privilege of
[1:05:41] introducing to the world the Messiah
[1:05:44] God now are you following it yes the
[1:05:48] others
[1:05:50] prophesied of his coming which would
[1:05:52] build a body
[1:05:55] but John come to
[1:05:58] introduce
[1:06:00] amen Elijah of you know going back down
[1:06:04] the other times we believe in the five
[1:06:06] comings of Elijah right Elijah Elisha uh
[1:06:09] John the Baptist number three Bachi four
[1:06:11] into our day and and the last one to be
[1:06:14] with two witnesses to the Jews all right
[1:06:17] but none of those prophets of the Old
[1:06:20] Testament introduced
[1:06:23] Christ they could only prophesy of his
[1:06:26] coming do you follow me what they said
[1:06:28] is the word of God but none of them said
[1:06:31] behold there stands a
[1:06:35] man right the only prophesied of a man
[1:06:38] that would
[1:06:40] come John the Baptist said
[1:06:45] behold let's see if I can find
[1:06:51] it I'll get to it in a minute if I don't
[1:06:53] I'll miss it it okay uh go down to 19
[1:06:58] which is spoken words of regional seed
[1:06:59] number two 62 318 uh paragraph 441 as
[1:07:05] the end time
[1:07:07] prophecies will
[1:07:09] repeat I believe as the first Forerunner
[1:07:12] came from the Wilderness and cried
[1:07:15] Behold the Lamb of
[1:07:17] God now watch the second Forerunner will
[1:07:22] probably do the same watch by pointing
[1:07:26] the people to a word born bride
[1:07:31] amen the bride of Christ will be pointed
[1:07:33] to the skies at the appearing of Jesus
[1:07:36] screaming Behold the Lamb of God will
[1:07:38] come forth from his lips God help us to
[1:07:40] be
[1:07:41] ready you see this Prophet didn't just
[1:07:45] prophesy of his
[1:07:47] coming come on you need this quote he
[1:07:51] said I'm not saying he's coming
[1:07:55] I'm saying he's
[1:07:57] here to him he was
[1:08:00] there that's right well you he we're
[1:08:03] good
[1:08:05] Baptist well he's here well how you know
[1:08:07] brother Bram said he
[1:08:10] was Oh my he said why do you say Baptist
[1:08:14] cuz that's the way we Baptist
[1:08:17] was none of you wouldn't Baptist you
[1:08:20] didn't never talk to your pastor and he
[1:08:22] says I got the Holy Ghost well how do
[1:08:25] you know it came on the day of
[1:08:28] Pentecost you didn't never talk to him
[1:08:30] you didn't never hear him say things
[1:08:31] like it I know I'm born again it came on
[1:08:33] De Pentecost well what do that got to do
[1:08:34] with it that's right prostitution went
[1:08:37] up last year does that make that
[1:08:39] okay you said you're stupid brother Dale
[1:08:42] no I just make plain
[1:08:44] statements to keep us from being so
[1:08:48] dumb brother random says I'm not saying
[1:08:51] he's coming I'm saying he's here but you
[1:08:53] know what what he's the only man in the
[1:08:55] world at that time that could say that
[1:08:58] that's right that's
[1:09:00] true but for me to quote that don't make
[1:09:03] him here
[1:09:05] right come on that's right prach I could
[1:09:09] quote The Book of Revelation before
[1:09:10] brother random ever come to tell me what
[1:09:12] it was saying come on couldn't
[1:09:15] you come
[1:09:17] on I could quote that Jesus was God
[1:09:20] unless you believe that I am he you'll
[1:09:22] die in your sins and then turn around
[1:09:24] and tell you he was a third person in
[1:09:25] the
[1:09:28] Trinity oh brother Dale you not expose
[1:09:31] us like
[1:09:32] that why
[1:09:36] not being dumb is being
[1:09:39] dumb I've never been too smart I guess
[1:09:42] that's why I don't get along with people
[1:09:45] I've never been smart enough to be smart
[1:09:48] I'm just dumb enough to believe what the
[1:09:50] word of God
[1:09:52] says and to not say he's here called
[1:09:55] brother R said it you ask the people of
[1:09:58] this message to put their own Revelation
[1:09:59] in the
[1:10:05] Bible they say brother R said brother R
[1:10:07] said brother R said brother R
[1:10:12] said and you say well you not be a
[1:10:14] parakeet let me just be a parakeet
[1:10:17] that's all I want to do it's just well
[1:10:18] go ahead and be a
[1:10:20] bird you got a bird brain
[1:10:26] you know brother Dale's aggravating and
[1:10:28] hateful but you get the point don't
[1:10:31] you of how silly we are that's right and
[1:10:35] that's all I care I'll answer for those
[1:10:37] other things one day to God myself but
[1:10:39] you're going to answer for what's
[1:10:42] said the dumb donkey couldn't be nothing
[1:10:45] but a dumb
[1:10:48] donkey that's what I said in the church
[1:10:50] one time about a
[1:10:52] brother I said a dumb donkey corrected a
[1:10:56] prophet and I said a couple of dumb
[1:10:58] donkeys like the brother and I called
[1:10:59] his
[1:11:00] name of course I didn't use the word
[1:11:02] donkey yeah and they all laughed at me
[1:11:05] and I said you got the word and you got
[1:11:07] it in the wrong place I meant it like it
[1:11:09] is he was a dumb donkey and we're dumb
[1:11:14] donkeys because what we need to do is
[1:11:16] get the new
[1:11:18] birth yes sir all right that's right but
[1:11:20] do you
[1:11:22] understand
[1:11:27] John was
[1:11:28] sent we found in Matthew it wasn't so
[1:11:32] from the
[1:11:34] beginning first you know and introduced
[1:11:37] them to the Messiah he was a great
[1:11:40] prophet John between the two ages now
[1:11:44] listen between law and
[1:11:47] Grace and he preached that there was a
[1:11:49] messiah coming that was going to
[1:11:51] thoroughly Purge the floor and gather
[1:11:54] the
[1:11:54] grain all right but then see that was
[1:11:59] only prophesying right yes I'm trying to
[1:12:04] illustrate what he said while IO when I
[1:12:05] said those prophets were only prophesy
[1:12:08] when John walked out there and bringing
[1:12:10] his message he was first
[1:12:13] prophesying
[1:12:15] yes right cuz he was telling them the
[1:12:17] Messiah was coming but then one day he
[1:12:21] says Behold the Lamb of God right that
[1:12:25] was no longer prophesying he was
[1:12:26] introducing Christ Amen brother brandom
[1:12:29] started out in his years and he come
[1:12:31] down prophesying right putting together
[1:12:34] the scriptures but one day he said he's
[1:12:37] here
[1:12:39] right it was no longer prophesying
[1:12:41] anymore when are we going to get away
[1:12:42] from
[1:12:43] that when are we going to get around to
[1:12:45] what he says here off of there's a man
[1:12:47] here pull this up number 18 I'll go
[1:12:50] ahead and read down to it but pull
[1:12:51] number 18 there is a man here that can
[1:12:52] turn on the lights 1963 1229 the morning
[1:12:55] service paragraph 162 yesterday's Luther
[1:12:58] Mana would not work for Methodist
[1:13:01] Methodist Mana would not work for
[1:13:03] Pentecost Pentecostal Mana will not work
[1:13:06] for
[1:13:07] today see what I mean every day is Come
[1:13:11] Day by Day fresh watch now every day it
[1:13:16] come day by day fresh and so has it
[1:13:20] through the church ages that's it
[1:13:23] Luther's manner was the message of
[1:13:25] justification Wesley's message was the
[1:13:27] manifestation of
[1:13:29] sanctification Pentecostals was the
[1:13:31] restoration of the gifts but this is
[1:13:34] introducing The
[1:13:41] Headstone the last day the bride
[1:13:45] tree oh what now now brother Brandon you
[1:13:50] sure do goof up a lot oh my but this is
[1:13:54] introducing The Headstone come
[1:13:56] on come on
[1:13:59] preach the last days the bride
[1:14:05] tree who's going to make the headstone
[1:14:08] manifest come on Amen come on we're
[1:14:11] expecting a headstone to unite it where
[1:14:13] brother Brown said one day the head and
[1:14:14] body unite and said God would do in one
[1:14:17] year what theologist tried to do in 2000
[1:14:19] but said he's doing it
[1:14:20] now that's a direct quote amen 40
[1:14:23] something years ago and I still quote
[1:14:26] it you see what I'm telling you folks
[1:14:29] this is not something new this is not
[1:14:30] something that brother Dale started
[1:14:31] preaching three weeks ago it's when I
[1:14:34] started preaching in 1970 or 69
[1:14:41] 7071 who wanted to hear it then and who
[1:14:43] wants to hear it
[1:14:48] now I don't want to hear
[1:14:50] it well that's just old Mana that's I
[1:14:53] love the man of
[1:14:56] myself so what did he
[1:14:59] say spoken words Original Seed we've
[1:15:02] reading that while ago the end time
[1:15:03] prophecies will repeat I believe as the
[1:15:05] first Forerunner came from the
[1:15:07] Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of
[1:15:08] God the second Forerunner will probably
[1:15:10] do the same by pointing the people to a
[1:15:13] word born bride the bride of Christ will
[1:15:16] be pointed to the skies at the appearing
[1:15:18] of Jesus Christ screaming Behold the
[1:15:21] Lamb of God will come for for from his
[1:15:23] lips God help us to be ready for that
[1:15:26] great that near event at the appearing
[1:15:28] he said now what's the difference
[1:15:30] brother RAM on I'll think of it in a
[1:15:32] minute but I'm I'll get it uh looking at
[1:15:35] the book but I can't read the title um
[1:15:37] but he
[1:15:38] says there's a difference in the
[1:15:40] appearing and the
[1:15:44] coming you know he can appear right over
[1:15:46] there in that church today heal the sick
[1:15:50] do great
[1:15:51] things did you say well he's coming over
[1:15:54] there now I differ with you
[1:15:56] right cuz he's not trying to come over
[1:15:59] there no he's trying to come to his
[1:16:04] bride well if he' want to okay all
[1:16:08] right but there's a difference in the
[1:16:10] appearing and the
[1:16:12] coming so when brother Brandon was here
[1:16:15] he was
[1:16:17] pointing to a word born bride in other
[1:16:20] words telling about a bride that would
[1:16:21] be born by the word
[1:16:24] amen right that's in his
[1:16:27] appearing but there's a difference in
[1:16:29] his that and his coming all
[1:16:33] right what did it say on the River
[1:16:35] Jordan as John the Baptist was sent to
[1:16:37] forerun the second coming of Jesus
[1:16:40] Christ your for your message self as as
[1:16:43] John the Baptist was sent to for forerun
[1:16:45] the first coming of Jesus Christ your
[1:16:47] message will forun the second
[1:16:51] coming right
[1:16:55] look what he says in a man here that can
[1:16:56] turn on the
[1:16:59] lights talking about the architect was
[1:17:01] so
[1:17:02] great he said they lost the he's talking
[1:17:05] about the pyramid right paragraph 102 10
[1:17:08] I mean 101
[1:17:09] 102 they lost a headstone they don't
[1:17:12] know where it's at now when that
[1:17:14] headstone returns it'll be just like the
[1:17:17] rest of it it will blend in with the
[1:17:20] with the stone that's left
[1:17:24] open if you should put the headstone on
[1:17:27] it it have to be that way and when Jesus
[1:17:31] returns he'll find a church that's
[1:17:33] washed without spot or wrinkle and it'll
[1:17:36] be the same Ministry he had y right
[1:17:40] it'll bring back The Headstone
[1:17:44] right drop down paragraph
[1:17:48] 104 that's when C church and Christ
[1:17:51] unites together as a bride with the same
[1:17:54] spirit that was in him will be upon her
[1:17:57] when that church comes from
[1:17:58] justification sanctification and baptism
[1:18:00] of the Holy Ghost into the last days and
[1:18:04] horning her down now for the coming
[1:18:08] right of the Lord drop on down to
[1:18:11] paragraph
[1:18:13] 106 he's talking about remember how they
[1:18:15] took the rags and used to make p used to
[1:18:17] make paper out of it you know the
[1:18:19] rag it's Christ now taking the rags of
[1:18:23] yesterday the Lutheran Methodist
[1:18:25] Presbyterian and so forth and he's
[1:18:27] putting it to a process what kind of a
[1:18:29] process a process of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:32] what they had
[1:18:34] plus making it till he is pressing his
[1:18:37] own
[1:18:38] image when the church in Christ becomes
[1:18:41] one in Union God granted he
[1:18:45] says what is this messenger of Malachi 4
[1:18:48] to
[1:18:51] do amen
[1:18:53] right throw the last one up there so
[1:18:56] messenger of Malachi 4 Church age book
[1:18:58] what does he say she's to do I mean he's
[1:19:00] to
[1:19:01] do he's to do two
[1:19:05] things right what's he to do 327 Church
[1:19:11] age book Lady of sin Church
[1:19:13] age this messenger of Malachi 4 Ruth
[1:19:15] 1730 7 Revelations 10:7 is going to do
[1:19:20] two things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:19:23] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:19:24] the fathers that's not taught anymore in
[1:19:26] the message because we're well beyond
[1:19:27] all of that they don't talk about the
[1:19:30] faith of the
[1:19:31] fathers because you can't take the faith
[1:19:33] of the fathers and place these
[1:19:35] doctrines that people have in there
[1:19:38] that's right you show me where the
[1:19:40] disciples taught two
[1:19:43] Lords you show me where they taught of
[1:19:45] Jesus being just a man until River
[1:19:50] Jordan come
[1:19:51] on put two souls in a Doctrine in the
[1:19:57] Bible but we're beyond that
[1:20:00] brother well you're standing in
[1:20:04] midair because you don't have a
[1:20:06] foundation
[1:20:11] oh according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the
[1:20:14] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:20:16] right number two he will reveal the
[1:20:18] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:20:20] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[1:20:23] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[1:20:25] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:20:27] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:20:29] children to the Pentecostal
[1:20:32] father well brother Dale tell me what
[1:20:35] the Thunders
[1:20:39] are according to the seal book he said
[1:20:42] the Thunder was the voice of God when
[1:20:44] the seal broke now that's what he had to
[1:20:46] say about it so you go ahead
[1:20:49] right that's right well then tell me his
[1:20:53] new
[1:20:57] name the prophet said maybe it'll be
[1:20:59] made known when we get
[1:21:03] there well you're just trying to buy
[1:21:05] pice well I ain't trying to buy
[1:21:08] pice I'm just trying to do one
[1:21:12] thing I'm as honest as I can be and this
[1:21:15] is Brother
[1:21:16] Dale I've never been looking for a new
[1:21:20] name because I haven't run out yet in
[1:21:23] the name of Jesus am right and I happen
[1:21:28] to know that when he appears to the two
[1:21:31] witnesses after we get out of here he'll
[1:21:33] still be Jesus and I happen to know when
[1:21:36] it comes to the white Throne he'll still
[1:21:39] be Jesus now happen to know in the
[1:21:41] Millennium it'll still be
[1:21:44] Jesus that's right if he wants to reveal
[1:21:47] a new name when we get over there in the
[1:21:49] future home that's fine with me but
[1:21:52] there's one thing about it you'll never
[1:21:54] forget that he was
[1:21:57] Jesus you can't take another name to
[1:22:01] erase
[1:22:03] Jesus that's all I've ever said
[1:22:06] amen but they Wan some kind of a rabbit
[1:22:08] in a hat
[1:22:10] trick where they could find some name
[1:22:13] like brother brandham like people back
[1:22:15] when I first came in said brother
[1:22:16] brandom's mouth was
[1:22:18] formed you know formed a certain way
[1:22:21] that he could speak that
[1:22:26] word I thought our thoughts in heaven
[1:22:28] were louder than our words on Earth I
[1:22:30] didn't know we had to
[1:22:32] be blabber
[1:22:35] Mouse for him to be able to hear
[1:22:41] us what are you doing brother Dale what
[1:22:44] am I
[1:22:45] doing I'm trying my best to preach Jesus
[1:22:48] Christ
[1:22:51] amen amen and preach Christ in The Bride
[1:22:55] As Paul said the hope of glory that's
[1:22:58] right
[1:23:00] amen he can do what he wants to but if
[1:23:04] we're not ready we can't hear what he's
[1:23:08] saying that's right how many heard what
[1:23:12] John the Baptist
[1:23:14] said right right right but how many
[1:23:18] believed what John the Baptist
[1:23:21] said that's
[1:23:27] right now I'm just pling language and I
[1:23:32] know but I want scripture where it was
[1:23:34] anybody jumped up and down screamed and
[1:23:37] hollered when John said Behold the Lamb
[1:23:38] of God that takes away the sin of the
[1:23:43] world the only thing you have John with
[1:23:45] any part he turned two or three of his
[1:23:47] disciples you remember they came to John
[1:23:50] before they put him in prison there in
[1:23:52] the script
[1:23:53] and he says in other words follow
[1:24:01] him but you see we're looking for some
[1:24:03] kind of this or that or the
[1:24:06] other I'm still looking for what I did
[1:24:08] when I came in this message and begin to
[1:24:11] see what that Prophet was talking
[1:24:15] about and I still believe it
[1:24:21] today that they without us cannot be
[1:24:23] made perfect and that day mean that they
[1:24:27] without us means everybody from here
[1:24:30] back all the way back to Adam and Eve in
[1:24:33] the garden amen that's right that's how
[1:24:35] I believe it right
[1:24:39] Hallelujah they can't be made
[1:24:43] perfect without you and
[1:24:47] me are we going to call them up and
[1:24:49] preach something to them make them
[1:24:50] perfect
[1:24:51] no
[1:24:53] you don't have to preach nothing to
[1:24:55] Luther he's going to raise Perfect Right
[1:24:58] amen that's right you don't have to have
[1:25:00] something to perfect him he's going to
[1:25:02] raise perfect or he's not going to raise
[1:25:06] come on musicians think on these things
[1:25:10] a body thou Hast prepared me the Bride
[1:25:13] of Jesus Christ is the body of almighty
[1:25:15] God upon Earth in this
[1:25:21] day
[1:25:23] and she is to vindicate Malachi for Luke
[1:25:27] 17:30 Revelations
[1:25:32] 10:7 that's
[1:25:37] right we're not going to prove this
[1:25:39] message to be right in the basis that
[1:25:42] that was already
[1:25:45] proven we're going to
[1:25:47] prove that what the messenger
[1:25:50] said about this right in the end time is
[1:25:55] right there's a little difference in
[1:25:57] what I just
[1:26:01] said somebody's going to take what he
[1:26:04] says and says I am the message you
[1:26:08] remember when
[1:26:09] the Welch Revival or which one it was
[1:26:12] you know and the police officer standing
[1:26:14] there you know and sir I want to know
[1:26:16] where the Revival at he said you're
[1:26:17] looking at
[1:26:20] it that's right when are we going to let
[1:26:22] it be that
[1:26:23] way when are we going to let it be the
[1:26:25] messages right here in you and
[1:26:28] I but I just don't see it that's the
[1:26:31] same thing You' have said when Jesus was
[1:26:33] here and the same thing You' have said
[1:26:34] when brother Brandon was
[1:26:36] here there's no difference this just the
[1:26:38] same different age no i' have believed
[1:26:41] it when brother Brandon was here you'd
[1:26:42] have believed it till he turned one
[1:26:43] around the corner because at 300
[1:26:45] preachers we want the tapes brother
[1:26:47] brandom you remember he said it we want
[1:26:49] the tapes we're going to bring all of
[1:26:51] our people we going to baptize him and
[1:26:54] not
[1:26:55] one came
[1:27:00] back you know what I'd do if I'd have
[1:27:02] been sitting under one of them
[1:27:04] preachers and he done that I would have
[1:27:07] been gone somewhere
[1:27:12] else
[1:27:15] right come on go ahead what we got let's
[1:27:17] Stand Together 566 let's just sing a
[1:27:19] verse and then we go eat all through
[1:27:24] me
[1:27:25] Holy Spirit flow through
[1:27:33] me through me Holy
[1:27:39] Spirit through
[1:27:43] me as I live my hands to
[1:27:50] worship tonight
[1:27:52] magy thy
[1:27:55] name through
[1:27:57] me Holy Spirit blow through me you
[1:28:03] believe
[1:28:05] it through
[1:28:08] me
[1:28:12] love that's what that sign means isn't
[1:28:16] it I told the Lord a long time ago I
[1:28:19] said when I raised my hands I you to
[1:28:22] know that I love
[1:28:25] you brother told me he said that's too
[1:28:28] close to a worldly
[1:28:31] sign I don't care what the sign is what
[1:28:34] I told him I said that means I love
[1:28:41] you I said but the problem is is the
[1:28:44] sign you make brother he said what I
[1:28:47] said you do that all the time you're
[1:28:51] preaching
[1:28:53] I said when you're preaching you're
[1:28:54] doing that I said that is the Catholic
