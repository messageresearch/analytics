[2:13] second peter
[2:15] the second chapter
[2:18] beginning with verse nine
[2:22] lord knoweth how to deliver the godly
[2:25] out of temptation and to
[2:27] preserve the unjust unto the day of
[2:30] judgment to be punished
[2:35] [Music]
[2:48] whereas angels which are greater in
[2:51] power and might
[2:53] bring
[2:54] not railing accusations against them
[2:58] before the
[3:03] thing to be lord and destroyed speaking
[3:06] of the things that they understand
[3:09] and shall utterly perish in their own
[3:12] corruption
[3:13] and shall receive the reward of
[3:16] unrighteousness as they count a pleasure
[3:19] to riot in the daytime
[3:23] sport they
[3:24] are
[3:25] blemished
[3:26] sporting themselves with their own
[3:29] deceivings
[3:31] while they
[3:32] fished with you
[3:35] having eyes full of adultery
[3:38] that cannot cease from sin
[3:40] the god of the unstable souls
[3:47] cursed children
[3:50] which have forsaken the united way
[3:53] and are gone astray
[3:55] following the way of balaam and sons of
[3:59] belzar
[4:00] who love the wages of unrighteousness
[4:07] but on that speaking man's voice forbade
[4:11] the madness of the prophet
[4:14] these are whales without water
[4:17] clouds they are
[4:19] carried with a tempest
[4:21] to whom
[4:22] the miss
[4:24] darkness is reserved forever
[4:42] while they promised them liberty they
[4:45] themselves are the servants of
[4:47] corruption
[4:48] for who whom
[4:50] a man is overcome
[4:53] of same as he brought in bondage
[4:58] if after they escaped
[5:03] the lord and the savior jesus christ
[5:10] the latter in his worst of them within
[5:12] the beginning
[5:14] for it had been better for them to have
[5:17] known the way of righteousness
[5:20] than to have known it and turn from the
[5:24] holy commandments and deliver unto
[5:29] god bless you be saved amen

[21:23] amen
[21:24] john 1 1.
[21:26] in the beginning was the word the word
[21:27] was with god and the word was god
[21:29] he was in the world go to verse 10 and
[21:31] the world was made by him and the world
[21:33] knew him not
[21:35] he came into his own and his own
[21:36] received him not but as many as received
[21:38] him to them gave he power
[21:40] to become the sons of god
[21:42] even to them that believe on his name
[21:44] which were born not of blood
[21:46] nor the will of the flesh nor the will
[21:48] of man but of god
[21:49] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[21:51] among us and we held his glory as the
[21:53] glory of the only begotten of the father
[21:55] full
[21:56] of grace and truth you may be seated in
[21:57] the lord at his blessing to the reading
[21:59] of the word now we're going to get into
[22:00] something today i kind of
[22:02] um
[22:03] backed up a little bit
[22:05] because it's very important
[22:08] to see that the church age that we were
[22:12] born in natural
[22:14] is the last church age
[22:17] there's no other church age besides this
[22:18] one for the gentiles as we were praying
[22:21] the gentile dispensation ends with the
[22:23] bride going in the rapture
[22:25] the gentile dispensation ends with the
[22:28] son of man in the bride back on earth
[22:31] again just like it was when the church
[22:33] age started 2 000 years ago everybody
[22:35] got that say amen all right so that's
[22:37] our mandate is to not just be good
[22:39] christians
[22:42] okay
[22:43] i want you to keep this thought in your
[22:45] mind
[22:46] as we talk about these things we we're
[22:48] going to take another maybe
[22:50] in a couple of weeks when we come back
[22:52] to preach again
[22:54] and i'll read it to you this afternoon
[22:56] just for something to keep in your mind
[22:58] that brother brown said your adoption is
[23:00] not your new birth
[23:04] your adoption is not your new birth
[23:07] that's what he was getting onto the
[23:08] pentecostals they got born again
[23:10] absolutely they got born again but they
[23:12] said this is it they stopped
[23:14] and they became
[23:15] babies
[23:17] but they didn't grow any further
[23:19] so god left them and went to what the
[23:21] prophet of god in the end time to bring
[23:23] us back to the faith of the fathers
[23:27] which was growth development
[23:30] so there's a difference between your new
[23:31] birth and adoption but it all
[23:33] intertwines but i'm going to pull it
[23:34] apart so that we can see both and that
[23:36] we can understand that you receive the
[23:38] spirit of adoption when you're born
[23:40] again but it doesn't guarantee that
[23:42] you're
[23:44] full
[23:45] come to full adoption sure you're
[23:46] adopted into the family
[23:48] you get a new name your name is now
[23:50] jesus this is jesus christ you're a
[23:52] christian now you do things different
[23:54] but still there's growth development and
[23:57] that's where the people the message as
[23:58] we talk
[23:59] to many different people around the
[24:00] country that it's just
[24:03] you know i hate to say it but god sent a
[24:05] prophet
[24:07] well what do you send him for
[24:09] amen
[24:10] he sent him for growth development
[24:12] because there hadn't been any growth
[24:14] development as i've been reading y'all
[24:15] over and over again where brother brown
[24:17] said down to the church ages it was just
[24:19] enough
[24:20] to get you saved
[24:23] filled with the holy ghost live a good
[24:25] christian life
[24:28] and pass on
[24:31] that was a requirement though
[24:33] that's not the requirement of this age
[24:36] it's a requirement that somebody come to
[24:38] full maturity just as jesus stood on the
[24:41] earth 2 000 years ago and said i am the
[24:43] resurrection and the life
[24:45] there's got to be a church in the end
[24:46] time that's going to stand on the same
[24:48] earth
[24:49] and say i'm the resurrection in the life
[24:51] because i have that guy living inside of
[24:53] me and i'm letting him use his full
[24:56] potential
[24:57] because you know what you and i just
[25:00] like brother john was talking about with
[25:01] money and different things you and i
[25:02] control
[25:04] a lot
[25:06] because we're free moral agents
[25:08] but god has predestinated
[25:10] a group of people
[25:12] because he saw that somebody would want
[25:13] it and he saw that somebody would want
[25:15] it more than life itself and wanted to
[25:18] move on and wanted to not be just to
[25:20] know it all but to have the knowledge of
[25:22] god
[25:24] that when there's a question arises
[25:25] somebody has an answer to that question
[25:28] man somebody has virtue that you can
[25:29] draw strength out of
[25:31] somebody you can depend on look at the
[25:33] people leaving the message that people
[25:35] depended on them for years 30 and 40
[25:37] years now where are they what are you
[25:39] dependent on now
[25:42] if you had a pastor stand up you know
[25:44] brother dale's never going to do that
[25:45] neither am i you got a pastor stands up
[25:47] and says well we're not going to believe
[25:48] brother adam anymore um
[25:50] we're going to be teaching just live
[25:52] good life and
[25:54] you're going backwards
[25:56] especially for this group right here
[25:58] sitting in this room it would be totally
[26:00] going from from it'd be going from
[26:02] college back to kindergarten
[26:05] well we don't want to do that
[26:07] we want to move on with god listen i
[26:09] want a graduation day
[26:11] i want a graduation day where that what
[26:13] i've learned
[26:15] what you've learned
[26:17] god will use through me and you he's not
[26:19] going to use it any other way
[26:22] he's built a body hebrews 10 5 says the
[26:24] body has now prepared me for 2 000 years
[26:29] he's
[26:30] built a body
[26:34] and some were fingers
[26:36] some were toes some were hands
[26:40] some were
[26:42] chest
[26:43] body
[26:44] but no one's ever been the head
[26:49] no one's ever been the head
[26:51] that's what i want to talk about just
[26:52] for a few minutes today and if i don't
[26:54] get finished that's okay
[26:55] ephesians 5 verse 23 as we look in
[26:58] and
[26:59] we have to bring a little bit of
[27:00] marriage and divorce sorry
[27:02] but for the husband is the head of the
[27:03] wife
[27:04] but now look if we stop there
[27:08] we'll be in trouble
[27:10] but we say even as christ is head of the
[27:13] church
[27:15] so in that you how you treat your wife
[27:17] is the way god's going to treat you
[27:20] the way y'all answered some of them
[27:22] questions last night i'm beginning to
[27:23] wonder
[27:28] that's life folks
[27:30] and he is the savior of the body
[27:33] see he don't need saving he didn't say
[27:35] the savior of the head he is the savior
[27:38] the savior is the head and i want to
[27:40] read something to you in just a minute
[27:41] that i found on the internet it must be
[27:43] true
[27:45] so let's read number let's look
[27:47] colossians 1 18. he is the head of the
[27:50] body
[27:51] the church
[27:53] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[27:56] the dead that in all things he might
[27:58] have the preeminence now we go to i
[28:00] didn't put it in here but go to
[28:01] revelations 3 14 isn't that's our
[28:03] mandate
[28:04] revelations 3 14 the beginning of the
[28:07] creation of god
[28:10] that's what our messenger brought us
[28:13] you say the beginning nobody had ever
[28:15] seen him that way before
[28:18] nobody's ever seen jesus christ the way
[28:20] that
[28:21] the prophet of god delivered it to us
[28:24] no one
[28:25] maybe the disciples a little bit
[28:28] but you and i have that all plus yes
[28:31] we have all that information
[28:34] all that godly knowledge all that all
[28:37] the different things that we have but
[28:39] what have we done we
[28:40] we just took and said well like i said
[28:42] before you read where brother brown says
[28:44] i don't know that we're getting them to
[28:45] a new birth we're getting them to a
[28:46] theory
[28:48] or an idea
[28:49] and i think that's why we've been here
[28:50] for 60 years
[28:52] we've got ideas
[28:54] not a new birth
[28:56] amen
[28:57] listen even with the new birth you're
[28:59] gonna have problems
[29:02] okay
[29:03] now look at number one in laodicean
[29:04] church age
[29:06] he is god's creation the first and the
[29:08] last the amen the beginning of the
[29:10] creation of god when god created himself
[29:12] a body he came down and lived in it
[29:15] that's the beginning of the creation of
[29:16] god oh isn't he wonderful now let's take
[29:18] that and say look when god created
[29:20] himself a church
[29:22] when god created himself a bride
[29:25] when god created himself a bride that's
[29:27] his body right
[29:30] and he came down and lived in it
[29:32] on the day of pentecost what did he do
[29:34] he came down and lived in it
[29:36] if you're born again today he is pleased
[29:38] to dwell in you and he is residing
[29:40] in you not on you and he's not
[29:44] he has permanent residency in the people
[29:46] that have the new birth
[29:47] he does not have permanent residency if
[29:49] you've just got an anointing
[29:56] john the one that he go the spirit goes
[29:59] on and what remains
[30:02] remains on this person not just hopping
[30:05] from one to the other because he can
[30:06] anoint caiaphas and him being the one
[30:08] that put jesus on the cross but john
[30:10] could see the anointing
[30:12] hit those priests
[30:13] and say wait a minute what's going on
[30:15] but god told him john you're a prophet
[30:18] i'm going to show you that this is going
[30:20] to descend on a one man
[30:23] and remain
[30:26] and keep
[30:27] and keep on
[30:29] and john said there he is the lamb of
[30:30] god that takes away the sin of the world
[30:32] he saw that spirit remain
[30:35] and listen god's not an indian giver
[30:38] he gives you the holy ghost
[30:41] that's why he's pleased to dwell
[30:43] he knows you're in game but you don't
[30:46] that's called a journey
[30:48] that's called a testimony that's called
[30:50] a life that we live but you know what in
[30:52] being that take and look in the bible
[30:56] you take all the people david
[30:59] isaiah
[31:00] solomon the different ones they had a
[31:03] journey
[31:04] and god recorded that journey in the
[31:06] bible
[31:07] amen
[31:09] paul
[31:11] different ones that journey was written
[31:13] in the bible well listen so is your
[31:15] journey written in the bible
[31:17] the way you came to god had to come from
[31:19] the bible it couldn't come any other way
[31:22] about all right
[31:24] so when god created himself a bride
[31:26] he came down and lived in that bride
[31:28] that's the beginning of the creation of
[31:30] god that's the way he wanted it and
[31:32] brother tells us that we're the
[31:33] continuation and we'll read that just
[31:35] right now in the layout of seeing church
[31:37] age
[31:38] this will be the same just continuing
[31:41] with that quote
[31:43] but now he's standing in the midst of
[31:44] the church as he stands there
[31:47] revealing now watch
[31:49] who he is in this last age now last age
[31:53] he calls himself the author of the
[31:55] creation of god
[31:57] this is another
[31:59] creation
[32:02] aren't you a new creature when you're
[32:04] born again
[32:06] new creation
[32:10] this has to do
[32:12] with the church or the bride this is a
[32:14] special designation of himself because
[32:16] listen we're the only ones that can call
[32:19] him husband
[32:21] i was thinking yesterday you know a lot
[32:23] of people call him husband
[32:26] but they don't have the marriage
[32:28] certificate
[32:30] you and i have the marriage certificate
[32:32] that shows listen the vow is what
[32:34] married you but that certificate proves
[32:36] that you're married and and who you're
[32:38] married to
[32:42] brother brown said now i call you bride
[32:44] why'd he do that he showed that the
[32:45] marriage certificate was here that we
[32:47] could be able to tell who we are versus
[32:49] the church
[32:51] versus the church because listen if the
[32:53] church is not born again
[32:55] they can't call him husband
[32:58] they can try and satan can we'll get to
[33:00] in just a minute that's what satan has
[33:02] interjected
[33:04] oh you're okay
[33:05] you're his bride you believe jesus died
[33:07] on a cross didn't you
[33:09] that's not everything
[33:10] this is a special designation of himself
[33:12] he is the creator of that church
[33:15] when did he start create on the day of
[33:17] pentecost
[33:18] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[33:20] bride
[33:22] this new creation is not the old
[33:24] creation made over
[33:28] listen if you're the old creation made
[33:30] over you've not divorced you're not
[33:32] divorced yet your husband's not dead
[33:34] you're still married to that first
[33:36] creation the one your mom and daddy gave
[33:38] you that's what he's talking about
[33:41] he said boy i don't look him
[33:42] inside
[33:44] you're new
[33:46] whatever looks like this is okay don't
[33:48] worry about it but what's inside of you
[33:50] is new
[33:51] new thoughts new ideas listen if you're
[33:53] doing the same thing you did
[33:58] your old husband's not dead
[34:01] sure we have problems
[34:03] but you know what your desires were
[34:04] before you came to god
[34:08] you know what your desire i can't tell
[34:10] you your desires and you can testify for
[34:12] 20 years and tell me about your life but
[34:14] i didn't live it
[34:16] you did
[34:17] so you know and you know what there's
[34:18] two other people that know who the life
[34:20] you live too god and satan
[34:23] they both know what life you live you
[34:24] know what life you live you all need to
[34:26] get together somewhere and figure out
[34:27] which one you're gonna live by
[34:30] this is exactly what it says no wait a
[34:33] minute this new creation is not the old
[34:34] creation made over or it could not be
[34:36] called a new creation this is exactly
[34:39] what it says it is new creation it is
[34:42] another creation look distinct from the
[34:45] old
[34:48] because what's your whole creation doing
[34:50] is killing you
[34:55] distinct from the old one no longer is
[34:57] he dealing by ways of the flesh
[35:01] wow
[35:02] that was how he dealt with israel
[35:05] he chose abraham and of abraham's issue
[35:07] through the godly isaac line but look
[35:09] but now out of every kindred tribe
[35:11] nation what's he talking about gentiles
[35:13] he has purposed a new creation he is the
[35:16] first of that creation he was god
[35:19] created in the form of the man what's he
[35:21] telling you if you've got the new birth
[35:22] you're a god created in the fall come on
[35:25] people good grief
[35:29] now by his spirit he's creating many
[35:31] sons unto himself god the creator
[35:34] creating himself a part of his creation
[35:37] look
[35:38] this is the true revelation of god
[35:42] how positive is that this is the true
[35:44] revelation of god in other words this is
[35:47] what you need to know right amen
[35:49] this was his purpose
[35:51] this purpose took form through election
[35:54] what's the election
[35:55] your vote
[35:57] god's vote satan's vote who swings the
[36:00] vote you do because god and the devil is
[36:02] never going to vote on the same thing
[36:05] their contrary
[36:06] this purpose took place through election
[36:08] this is why he could look right down to
[36:10] the last age when all would be over and
[36:13] see himself still in the midst of the
[36:15] church he's going back to revelations
[36:17] one
[36:18] as author of this new creation of god
[36:22] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[36:24] by his own decree he elected the members
[36:27] of this new creation he look he
[36:29] predestinated them to the adoption of
[36:31] children according to the good pleasure
[36:33] of his will now he's quoting scripture
[36:34] there
[36:35] he predestinated them who's them us
[36:39] or whoever connects ourselves to that i
[36:42] like what brother ernie says he said you
[36:44] we are connected to the eternal right
[36:46] but i'll go a little bit higher once you
[36:48] connect to the eternal you are the
[36:50] eternal
[36:51] amen
[36:53] now let's go to number three proving his
[36:55] word
[36:57] 1964.
[36:59] so he god came down after through this
[37:01] and now every son
[37:03] that you eat and born of natural sex
[37:04] birth the way you come
[37:07] then when it comes to a place to where
[37:08] you go through water baptism then holy
[37:11] ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes
[37:13] down at the fire baptism and claims this
[37:16] creation
[37:17] the same as it did him
[37:19] the holy ghost and god is the same
[37:21] spirit it comes down and claims this
[37:23] body
[37:26] for the resurrection
[37:28] claims this body for the resurrection
[37:31] and he was raised for our justification
[37:33] all the father has given me will come
[37:34] not one will be lost i'll raise it up at
[37:36] the last day not one hair of your head
[37:38] will ever perish
[37:40] that is the beginning of the creation of
[37:42] god this is the continuation of the
[37:45] creation of god
[37:48] then the whole earth has to have a
[37:49] baptism he's improving his word he's
[37:51] right after he preached future home
[37:53] and then the holy ghost comes down in a
[37:55] city to dwell upon the earth and the
[37:56] tabernacle of god is with man and dwells
[37:59] with them god has tabernacled here on
[38:01] earth
[38:02] this whole redemption plan justification
[38:05] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[38:07] the same as it is then
[38:09] you'll never get away from those three
[38:10] works of grace
[38:12] um brother bob and i were talking he did
[38:14] a a chart not too long ago you need you
[38:18] you it's a continual justification
[38:20] it's a continual sanctification
[38:22] continual baptism of the holy ghost
[38:25] because look you and i are contrary
[38:28] in our spirit and in our flesh we're
[38:31] contrary to god
[38:32] paul tells us that we're contrary that's
[38:35] why we read here in galatians we did a
[38:36] little bit the other night that he had
[38:38] to send us tutors and governors he had
[38:40] to send somebody to teach us well you
[38:42] can't get it on yourself by yourself
[38:45] how do you even think you got to be
[38:46] deceived if you think you can get it by
[38:48] yourself
[38:50] you know what's wrong you don't have the
[38:52] teacher inside of you
[38:54] sorry
[38:58] you can't deny the word you can't deny
[38:59] what the holy ghost said okay
[39:02] some of y'all need to go to sleep
[39:03] earlier at night
[39:09] and i'm sorry if this doesn't excite you
[39:11] i'm sorry i'm just
[39:13] telling you the word of god
[39:15] okay if i don't excite you then sleep on
[39:20] because i'm not gonna scream at you no
[39:22] more i may slam my face against the
[39:24] thing right here but i'm not gonna
[39:25] scream at you anymore
[39:30] realize that your daddy can take that
[39:31] off of his phone
[39:36] or he'll leave it there if he wants to
[39:39] all right let's go to matthew 3 verse
[39:41] 16.
[39:43] and this is where
[39:45] this is the headstone we're going to
[39:47] talk about the headstone just for a
[39:48] minute everybody okay
[39:50] those are you there to wait and jesus
[39:52] when he was baptized went up straightway
[39:53] out of the water and low the heaven was
[39:55] opened unto him and he saw who john saw
[39:57] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[39:59] and lighting upon it and lo a voice from
[40:01] heaven saying this is my beloved son in
[40:02] whom i'm well pleased
[40:04] but he didn't say here you him right
[40:07] this is the head of the church but even
[40:09] the headstone of the church had to grow
[40:12] in grace and knowledge he had to grow in
[40:14] stature
[40:16] amen
[40:18] and being made perfect we read those
[40:19] scriptures before we're going to try to
[40:21] skip through them a little bit but i
[40:23] want you to watch this matthew 17 verse
[40:25] five let's skip on a little bit further
[40:27] while yetis fake behold a bright cloud
[40:29] overshadow them and behold a voice out
[40:30] of the cloud now this was about a three
[40:32] year journey
[40:34] now bear with me
[40:36] when when the river jordan that started
[40:38] his ministry he had a three and a half
[40:39] year ministry brother brown said he went
[40:41] to mount transfiguration and six months
[40:43] later he was killed so there's a
[40:45] three-year gap
[40:48] from here from where he didn't say here
[40:50] you him to where he said here ye him
[40:52] everybody all right with that
[40:54] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[40:56] pleased hear ye him he had come to a
[40:59] place
[41:00] and we're going to talk about later on
[41:01] about a growth development and we had
[41:03] lifted eyes i saw no man save jesus only
[41:07] and as they came down from the mountain
[41:08] jesus charged him saying tell this
[41:10] vision to no man until the son of man be
[41:11] risen again
[41:13] from the dead
[41:16] we see that now
[41:19] the son of man is rising from the dead
[41:21] in the bride in the end time
[41:24] listen he can't rise in the ones that's
[41:26] already passed on
[41:29] this is live ministry
[41:32] okay
[41:33] and his disciples ask himself when say
[41:35] the scribes are the last most for why do
[41:36] they say the last must first come they
[41:38] go back to
[41:39] malachi and jesus answered and said unto
[41:41] them elijah truly shall first come and
[41:43] restore
[41:44] all things
[41:46] this message is a restoration message
[41:50] and it's not just to restore us
[41:53] to babies
[41:55] or teenagers
[41:57] it's to restore us to full adoption
[41:59] whether the wife is standing on earth
[42:01] not just the bride
[42:03] okay
[42:04] so now let's go we're going to look at
[42:05] this this is what we were looking at
[42:06] then i want to stop right here just for
[42:08] a second
[42:09] and read this quote go ahead and go
[42:11] raise it up to matthew 24.
[42:14] because remember after jesus said this
[42:17] in matthew 17
[42:18] you got to go to matthew 24 and jesus
[42:21] preaches the seals
[42:23] everybody with me
[42:24] jesus preaches the seals so now here's
[42:27] the order the order with you has got to
[42:29] be the same as with him if the son of
[42:31] man is going to be on earth in a bride
[42:33] you got to act the same way he did
[42:37] you must be born again please to dwell
[42:41] if you're not to that place you got to
[42:42] stop right there
[42:44] get born again
[42:47] seek god
[42:50] because you must be born again
[42:52] not you might need to be
[42:57] then you must go through the time of
[42:58] obedience how many of us
[43:03] brother dale's been your pastor some of
[43:05] you for 45 years or maybe almost 50
[43:07] years
[43:09] now if you see growth in him
[43:12] that means there's got to be growth
[43:14] somewhere
[43:15] in this congregation
[43:19] our god wasted his words
[43:22] that's why i thank god
[43:24] that we've had a capstone ministry we've
[43:26] had a ministry that's going to what draw
[43:28] us up
[43:29] draw us up and take these false
[43:31] doctrines listen jesus didn't have one
[43:33] false doctrine
[43:35] not one
[43:39] and paul comes and says there's
[43:41] therefore now no condemnation to them
[43:43] that believe
[43:44] who walk not after the flesh but after
[43:46] the what the spirit
[43:50] you must be born again please to dwell
[43:52] remember brother colleen brothers
[43:54] already know several those are the older
[43:56] ones in the group
[43:58] but they started with brother dale a
[43:59] long time ago
[44:01] started from the new birth and and been
[44:03] building ever since right brothers i'm
[44:05] just gonna
[44:06] i'm gonna use you today
[44:12] now when you got first born again
[44:16] this didn't come into play much
[44:19] come on people
[44:20] we fought and we fought and we fought
[44:23] that old nature
[44:25] right
[44:26] and i know we're still fighting it but
[44:27] there's got to be a little bit of
[44:29] obedience in there
[44:31] that comes from god
[44:33] not being obedient to the devil
[44:36] paul said in times past we leaned in
[44:38] other words to the to the lust of the
[44:40] flesh why we were in flesh
[44:43] but we have to come to obedience
[44:45] obedience
[44:47] obedience that's what we're going to
[44:48] talk about in just a minute but
[44:50] obedience has to come
[44:53] from the head
[44:57] obedience don't come from the hand
[44:59] obedience doesn't come from the foot
[45:02] obedience comes from the head anytime
[45:04] you misbehave sure your body is going to
[45:07] do what what your brain tells it to do
[45:10] the spirit that motivates your brain is
[45:12] going to tell you either come to church
[45:13] or don't come to church
[45:17] do this and don't do that
[45:19] and this is not do's and don'ts but
[45:20] listen it is do's and don'ts
[45:24] but it's a love affair of do's and
[45:26] don'ts
[45:29] a love affair
[45:32] you know
[45:34] look at that obedience
[45:38] obedience is better than sacrifice
[45:42] oh i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna there's
[45:44] too much eye in this right here
[45:46] obedience is what obedience to him
[45:49] obedience to the head that's where the
[45:51] obedience we'll read here in just a
[45:53] second i got something off the internet
[45:56] so then we come look there wasn't a here
[45:59] you him now we he we have the spirit of
[46:01] adoption
[46:02] right here we're going to carry it in
[46:04] romans 8 long a long time from now maybe
[46:07] you must be born again but you receive
[46:08] the spirit of adoption
[46:10] puts you in the line puts you in the
[46:12] family
[46:14] that's why i believe we baptize in the
[46:16] name of the lord jesus christ that
[46:17] doesn't put you in the family but it
[46:19] sure does stamp a name on you
[46:22] that you'll carry that name in water
[46:24] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[46:25] christ not father son holy ghost and
[46:28] then through obedience
[46:30] to the word
[46:32] is what brings us to adoption
[46:35] then here ye hem
[46:37] mount transfiguration
[46:40] adoption and there's no way you can
[46:43] understand the seals
[46:45] without already without going through
[46:47] this this is the problem a lot of people
[46:48] in the message are going yeah i read the
[46:50] seal book
[46:52] they put themselves right here yeah i
[46:53] read the seal book i know what that is
[46:55] no it's not
[46:57] if jesus had to go through all this
[47:01] then preach the seals you're going to
[47:03] have to go through all this brother
[47:04] branham he preached the seal sure in the
[47:07] 50s
[47:08] but that wasn't his message he had to
[47:10] come to an adoption he had to go to the
[47:11] sunset he had to go to the mountain
[47:14] where god said if you're going to hear
[47:15] anything now you're going to hear it
[47:16] from this guy right here and it's not
[47:18] going to be the white horse rider is the
[47:19] holy ghost it's not going to be
[47:23] false doctrine
[47:27] have i got that
[47:28] it's going to be the truth
[47:30] that's why the seals was the greatest
[47:32] message brother brown said he ever
[47:33] preached he never dealt in any other
[47:35] realm of spirituality
[47:37] this man saw hundreds of thousands of
[47:39] people
[47:41] healed eyeballs popping into their heads
[47:43] their feet just completely fallen their
[47:45] hand completely coming out and even
[47:47] asking a little girl said what color
[47:48] eyes do you want
[47:50] he said i've never worked in a realm
[47:52] until these seals open why because the
[47:53] word precedes everything
[47:57] the word precedes everything if he
[48:00] hadn't been
[48:01] obedient
[48:03] god would have never adopted him
[48:06] if you don't come to obedience to what
[48:08] is obedience
[48:10] faith verse your knowledge temperance
[48:12] patience godliness brother kindness
[48:16] obedience means you got to love your
[48:18] neighbor as you love yourself
[48:20] obedience is you got to love that guy
[48:22] that don't like you
[48:25] and then god will adopt you somewhere
[48:27] take you out backside of the desert
[48:29] brother brown said we'll read it just
[48:30] not today but later on and then that's
[48:33] when i believe that god give the seals
[48:35] to brother branham and listen
[48:37] that's when the book was open
[48:40] that's just what i believe that's when
[48:42] the book was open
[48:46] revelations 10 is the mighty angel
[48:48] coming down
[48:50] and in the days of the voice of the
[48:51] seventh angel when he begins to sound
[48:53] the mystery of god will be finished
[48:56] and then you and i are the john part
[48:58] that takes that book
[49:00] open book
[49:01] and gives it to the people
[49:03] and now what john did
[49:05] testify
[49:07] many tongues and nations
[49:09] you'll stand before
[49:11] and listen folks this message has stood
[49:12] the test of time
[49:14] this message is in every how many
[49:16] hundreds of
[49:17] of languages and there's people being
[49:19] born again
[49:20] there's people being filled with the
[49:22] holy ghost people that are becoming to
[49:23] obedience all around the world now not
[49:25] just a group of people in israel not
[49:27] just a group of people here not just a
[49:29] group of people in lula
[49:31] there's people all around the world
[49:32] that's coming to full obedience
[49:35] full obedience brings us to the what the
[49:37] token brother brown said now the tokens
[49:39] of baptism are holy ghosts but listen
[49:41] the token is to be applied to your body
[49:47] your body sure we apply the token to our
[49:50] children to our grandchildren but you
[49:52] gotta apply the token to your body
[49:53] because that token is right there where
[49:55] it says holy spirit
[49:58] you apply it to your body
[50:01] try that on for size
[50:03] then after the seals were preached
[50:06] the son of man disappeared
[50:12] can i get an amen
[50:14] thank you gosh what's wrong with you
[50:15] people today
[50:18] if you don't like me preaching just find
[50:20] somebody
[50:22] like aaron said wednesday night listen
[50:23] if i'm if i'm
[50:25] wait a minute
[50:26] hold on
[50:35] some people will never
[50:37] never like
[50:38] like you because your spirit irritates
[50:40] their demons
[50:46] let me read that one more time
[50:48] some people
[50:50] will never like you
[50:52] because your spirit irritates their
[50:53] demons
[51:08] i've come to the realization that um
[51:10] dad told me one time a long time ago he
[51:12] said son if everybody likes you you're a
[51:14] hypocrite
[51:16] and think about that
[51:18] if everybody likes you you're a
[51:19] hypocrite
[51:21] because you mold yourself to every
[51:23] person no you got to be your own person
[51:25] i'm going to be me
[51:27] you're going to be you
[51:29] brother dale has a style i have a style
[51:31] brother aaron has a style brother bob
[51:33] has a style
[51:34] and if you don't like my style then i'm
[51:36] you're stuck with me for a little while
[51:39] okay
[51:46] this is not an abusive marriage
[51:51] you can leave if you want to
[51:54] listen i want us to grow up in god
[51:56] listen listen to me just for a minute
[51:58] this is not in my sermon but um
[52:01] you know we voted brother dale in his
[52:02] pastor last sunday and there was some
[52:04] rumbling or some people maybe
[52:07] asking questions about it
[52:09] but listen
[52:11] he's been our pastor for 45 years
[52:14] he's not gone
[52:23] i still value his opinion
[52:26] and the shape he's in more than most of
[52:27] y'alls with the shape you're in
[52:30] hey man
[52:31] amen
[52:34] okay and i do
[52:37] honor everything by telling him what
[52:38] we're gonna do
[52:40] asking him
[52:41] what to do
[52:42] so he's here he's still the pastor
[52:45] i'm just assisting
[52:48] he will decide when he wants to quit
[52:51] he will decide he'll never quit
[52:55] he'll not quit he'll just kind of step
[52:56] aside one day but that's okay
[52:59] then y'all hire you a pastor if you want
[53:00] to
[53:03] but like brother tara says we're stuck
[53:04] with him for another year
[53:07] we can't impeach him
[53:10] listen i feel comfortable
[53:13] because my dad's sitting right there
[53:16] and he's my pastor i feel comfortable
[53:18] [Applause]
[53:21] so don't you think god's gonna still use
[53:23] that man if i do something wrong or if
[53:24] you didn't some wrong he's gonna say hey
[53:26] you did something wrong
[53:28] you need to back up on that or you need
[53:30] to add this or add that so let's just
[53:32] let's just calm down everybody we're
[53:34] okay we're good
[53:36] okay just listen to me for a little
[53:37] while and
[53:38] and
[53:39] you know get your naps in or whatever
[53:41] you need to do
[53:42] but um
[53:44] i love every one of you not my goal is
[53:46] to see you born again i don't care like
[53:48] brother dale said god make me a castaway
[53:50] paul said
[53:52] every time i walk out that door i go
[53:54] over there that mirror say god
[53:57] don't you slay me
[53:59] though i don't feel good today
[54:02] though half the people go to sleep
[54:04] use me to help one person today
[54:07] one person use me to help one person get
[54:10] me out of the way so much
[54:12] so god can speak maybe one sentence
[54:15] listen it may be all me and i'm trying
[54:17] to get that obedience part okay
[54:22] i've seen brother dale yield his self
[54:24] and not want to speak what he really
[54:26] wants to speak but he speaks what god
[54:28] told him to speak
[54:29] and you know what it works out 100 of
[54:31] the time because god's never wrong
[54:34] all right i'm not going to charge you
[54:35] for that so let's just continue on with
[54:36] god study read your bible pray pray for
[54:38] brother dale pray for the assistant
[54:40] pastor pray for these men pray for
[54:43] everybody
[54:45] listen pray for brother anderson god
[54:48] bless him he was that all week he was up
[54:50] here
[54:51] dealing with the devil
[54:55] well anderson's like
[54:57] trying to get this internet fixed and he
[54:59] actually got it where it's faster now
[55:00] inside the building
[55:02] much faster right much faster than it
[55:05] was so we're getting more information
[55:07] you know boo devil we're using your
[55:09] equipment
[55:10] to get the word of god out to the people
[55:16] amen
[55:17] all right here we go all right everybody
[55:19] okay
[55:20] but listen we got to have headship we
[55:22] got to have somebody to come up here you
[55:24] got to have somebody to make decisions
[55:25] you got to it's just got to happen that
[55:27] way we're sheep i'm sheep i'm led by a
[55:30] pastor
[55:31] we're he's led by the holy ghost what
[55:33] took that away
[55:35] we're that where'd that fall apart
[55:38] we are to be more now because you need
[55:40] to raise your holy ghost up a little bit
[55:42] raise your holy ghost up a notch
[55:45] let's look at it that way i need to
[55:46] raise my game up a little bit when the
[55:48] a-team's not here
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:52] same way with you
[55:54] pray for these people that pray for
[55:56] these people that forget to take
[55:59] forgets to take up the
[56:00] offering that jumps in and helps as much
[56:03] as he can
[56:04] god bless you for that that's how our
[56:06] body works
[56:08] is a body against each other
[56:11] house divided won't stand folks
[56:14] so let's bind together forget names
[56:17] bind together under god
[56:19] bind together under the word of god that
[56:20] we've already heard we've got a total
[56:22] foundation that that cannot be shaken
[56:25] all right
[56:26] so now
[56:28] look let's go to the next quote
[56:32] maybe i'll wake you up just a little bit
[56:34] there's been enough light to know that
[56:36] we ought to do right and wrong here's
[56:37] what brother brown says there's been
[56:39] enough
[56:40] light to know that you believed on the
[56:42] resurrection of the lord jesus accept
[56:43] him as your personal savior put your
[56:45] name on the church book and live the
[56:46] good life but as far as signs and waters
[56:48] and the direct way of the sun shining it
[56:50] hasn't been since pentecost all right
[56:52] because the head's not here but now
[56:55] according to psalms 1 18 21
[56:57] i will praise thee for thou have has
[56:59] heard me
[57:01] listen are you
[57:03] praying
[57:04] for headship
[57:06] are you praying for the headstone
[57:08] to be in your life
[57:11] i we can't worry about whether it's in
[57:12] brotherdale's or my life you got to
[57:14] worry about it's in yours
[57:17] if it's in our life it will project to
[57:19] you
[57:21] and then we'll all draw from that
[57:24] i go back to that vision brother they
[57:26] all had that time about pushing people
[57:27] up the mountain trying to get people to
[57:29] go up the mountain what's he doing
[57:31] to the holy ghost he's trying to get you
[57:33] to go up that's your perfect man
[57:36] and that's what we've been taught
[57:39] you ought to talk to people well some of
[57:41] you do but talk to people and just sit
[57:43] down and talk to them they don't even
[57:44] know what adoption is
[57:47] talked to a brother two days ago he said
[57:49] he talked to a brother about adoption
[57:50] and about the statute of performance
[57:52] that really didn't know what the world
[57:52] is talking about message people
[57:57] but listen
[57:58] much is given
[58:00] much is required
[58:03] so what we do with it
[58:05] makes a big difference
[58:07] so look the stone which the builders
[58:09] refused
[58:10] how was he refused
[58:12] even when god came back on the day of
[58:14] pentecost
[58:15] and started his church or his body there
[58:19] were people refuting it right off the
[58:22] bat
[58:24] paul said grievous wolves will come in
[58:27] peter called it the anti i mean
[58:29] john called it the antichrist
[58:32] already in the first church age down
[58:34] there at the bottom
[58:35] so he was refused
[58:37] he's become the headstone of the corner
[58:40] now let's look at this real quick now
[58:41] they don't have it back here back there
[58:43] so listen to me
[58:46] i looked up the word headship in the
[58:48] dictionary
[58:50] listen to this
[58:52] i i did quote it the other day a little
[58:54] bit because
[58:56] in middle in the middle east the law
[58:58] requires that all women except
[58:59] prostitutes and slaves be veiled
[59:04] headship
[59:06] but from the king's head
[59:09] comes his words
[59:11] think about it
[59:13] think about this
[59:16] we are not our own but bought with a
[59:17] price
[59:19] without the head there is no nourishment
[59:22] or growth
[59:25] no growth is possible without a head
[59:28] this body can be just as healthy as it
[59:30] can be
[59:31] but without that head controlling and
[59:33] telling you the body to take in this
[59:35] nutrient vitamin c vitamin d you see all
[59:37] the things that are
[59:38] what a great body we live in even though
[59:40] it's falling apart
[59:43] even with a fall there's things
[59:44] happening in your body that's happening
[59:46] every second of the day
[59:49] how many of you think to breathe when
[59:50] you go to bed
[59:52] you just go to bed and go to sleep
[59:54] and pray god that you wake up the next
[59:56] morning
[59:57] but your body's going
[1:00:02] watch this listen
[1:00:04] even the simplest person knows
[1:00:08] that food
[1:00:10] water
[1:00:11] and air
[1:00:12] cannot be taken by the body
[1:00:16] it has to be taken by the head
[1:00:20] think about that
[1:00:25] your eyes
[1:00:26] and your ears
[1:00:28] give guidance to your whole body
[1:00:32] your eyes and your ears give guidance to
[1:00:35] your whole body
[1:00:37] think about that
[1:00:40] that's from the internet so it must be
[1:00:42] the truth
[1:00:44] but it does seem pretty good i mean
[1:00:45] everything there
[1:00:46] all even your emotions
[1:00:48] your emotions are not from this
[1:00:51] your emotions come from your
[1:00:52] intelligence that comes from your head
[1:00:54] then it what it produces itself or shows
[1:00:57] itself or manifests itself through the
[1:00:59] body that's why paul said we need the
[1:01:00] mind of christ
[1:01:03] if you have the mind of christ
[1:01:06] what the problem is
[1:01:08] is like in ezra we were talking about
[1:01:10] we'll get to in just a second
[1:01:12] where the adversary came in they're
[1:01:13] trying to build the temple god's trying
[1:01:15] to build the temple
[1:01:18] sends them a prophet
[1:01:20] seasons are rubable
[1:01:22] and the bible says the adversaries
[1:01:25] they come and say oh we want to build
[1:01:27] with you
[1:01:31] and we want to do sacrifice
[1:01:34] zerubbabel and joshua said no
[1:01:36] you have nothing to do with the building
[1:01:38] of this house
[1:01:41] and it made the adversary so mad though
[1:01:42] they didn't go back
[1:01:45] no they attacked the people more
[1:01:48] they weakened the hands of the people
[1:01:50] that's what satan's trying to do that's
[1:01:52] what satan done even through the church
[1:01:54] ages though the pure word of god being
[1:01:57] preached by paul irenaeus martin columba
[1:01:59] luther wesley
[1:02:02] all that false doctrine was never
[1:02:03] preached by god
[1:02:06] it was preached by man
[1:02:08] man's intelligence got involved so what
[1:02:10] do we got to do we have to have a
[1:02:12] prophet come in the end time to reverse
[1:02:14] that
[1:02:15] do away with the false teaching do away
[1:02:18] with what satan being the only
[1:02:20] controller of your mind and saying look
[1:02:22] god give you
[1:02:25] holy ghost knowledge
[1:02:27] holy ghost temperance
[1:02:30] holy ghost patience
[1:02:31] but everything emanates from the head
[1:02:36] everything so if the head's not here the
[1:02:38] body's not complete
[1:02:40] scripture says the body's not complete
[1:02:41] without the head the head is not
[1:02:43] complete without the body so listen it's
[1:02:45] like brother brown said he said god
[1:02:46] needs you to
[1:02:48] he needs a body but by predestination by
[1:02:51] election by foreknowledge he knew they
[1:02:54] would be a group of people
[1:02:56] that would stand in the end time and not
[1:02:58] worry about what the world said not
[1:03:00] worry about even what so-called message
[1:03:03] believers say but they'll believe what
[1:03:05] god said
[1:03:07] how are they going to do that
[1:03:09] do a five-fold ministry
[1:03:13] listen to
[1:03:14] this let's go to the next
[1:03:17] um
[1:03:18] i think i got out of line a little bit
[1:03:20] yeah ephesians
[1:03:22] let's just read the red yeah it's hot in
[1:03:24] here and are built upon the foundation
[1:03:26] of the apostles and prophets
[1:03:28] jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:03:30] cornerstone and whom all the buildings
[1:03:32] fitly framed together
[1:03:34] groweth
[1:03:36] not stay babieth
[1:03:38] groweth
[1:03:40] babieth maybe not a word but that's okay
[1:03:42] it is now
[1:03:45] it's probably in the internet somewhere
[1:03:47] but look groweth unto a holy temple
[1:03:53] like brother richard said
[1:03:55] roberts the one that's leaving the
[1:03:56] building right now
[1:03:59] my wonderful brother-in-law he came down
[1:04:02] here and he he was taught
[1:04:06] by a message believer preacher
[1:04:10] but he never heard about statute perfect
[1:04:11] man
[1:04:12] you never heard that even brother
[1:04:14] branham says in the book
[1:04:16] it's a requirement
[1:04:18] now if it's a requirement
[1:04:21] are we having a baby
[1:04:23] no okay
[1:04:25] lisa we're getting ready to have another
[1:04:27] another niece and my finger's on the
[1:04:28] trigger
[1:04:30] so lisa when she walked out i thought
[1:04:31] maybe he was gonna have a baby
[1:04:33] but we're gonna have one this week you
[1:04:34] remember anna too anna dale
[1:04:36] not that that's anna roberts
[1:04:38] remember anna dale um she'll be having
[1:04:41] that baby sometime this week coming up
[1:04:42] so
[1:04:43] in whom all the body fitly framed
[1:04:45] together groweth unto a holy temple unto
[1:04:46] the lord in whom also look
[1:04:49] ye also are builded together you
[1:04:52] for a habitation of god
[1:04:56] in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[1:04:58] but then god wants listen god wants more
[1:05:01] than you do for you to be able to not
[1:05:04] cry all the time
[1:05:07] that's adoption
[1:05:08] that's coming to full maturity where
[1:05:10] your name is just as good on the
[1:05:12] checkbook
[1:05:14] we'll get to that
[1:05:16] listen to this let's go to ephesians 4
[1:05:18] 11. how can all this happen
[1:05:20] he gave some apostles
[1:05:22] some prophets
[1:05:24] some evangelists that's why we bring in
[1:05:27] fivefold ministry some of you need it
[1:05:30] i said some of you i'm talking to me
[1:05:32] i am the congregation
[1:05:34] okay some of us need pastors and
[1:05:37] teachers
[1:05:39] but some of you need evangelists
[1:05:41] us need evangelists
[1:05:43] and prophets and some of us need
[1:05:44] apostles
[1:05:45] it's a five-fold ministry that's why we
[1:05:47] like to bring in the five-fold ministry
[1:05:49] to
[1:05:50] what
[1:05:51] perfect you
[1:05:53] now i'm throwing it back to you
[1:05:58] you can sit here and listen to it if you
[1:06:00] want to or you can be perfected by it
[1:06:04] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:06:06] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:06:08] edifying of the body of christ
[1:06:11] till we all look
[1:06:13] because there's an end to it
[1:06:15] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:06:17] faith
[1:06:18] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:06:21] unto a white perfect man
[1:06:24] i'm running out of space here
[1:06:26] until the measure of the stature not
[1:06:28] statue a lot of you have become statues
[1:06:33] statues don't move
[1:06:36] and they keep their eyes closed
[1:06:41] but what is stature that doesn't say the
[1:06:42] statue of a perfect man it says the
[1:06:44] stature look it up it's it means height
[1:06:52] and watch how jesus was so
[1:06:54] he was so in tune with that until they
[1:06:56] were asking him questions and he stood
[1:06:58] up one day and he said you can't add
[1:07:00] anything to your statue
[1:07:05] in other words what he was saying but
[1:07:07] you can add to your stature
[1:07:11] that we henceforth look be no more
[1:07:14] children you're going to be children
[1:07:18] you're going to need a tutor and a
[1:07:18] governor we're going to read that here
[1:07:20] pretty quick
[1:07:23] but you know more children look toss to
[1:07:25] and fro
[1:07:26] look at people we were talking about
[1:07:27] this the other day you got people come
[1:07:29] into the church you know and you see
[1:07:30] them and like brother dale always said
[1:07:32] they they like a house on a fire in a
[1:07:33] fire on a windy day and a candle burning
[1:07:36] at both ends and they're just sitting on
[1:07:38] the front row no offense
[1:07:40] that front row is clear because the ones
[1:07:41] that used to sit there is gone
[1:07:45] you'll be okay just sit there
[1:07:47] but no they they're there and they look
[1:07:49] it's like it's kind of like the sower of
[1:07:51] the seed
[1:07:53] you know you go through the four parts
[1:07:55] of the sower the seed you sow the seed
[1:07:56] the seed falls into the ground and it
[1:07:58] grows up a little bit and all of a
[1:08:00] sudden what heat hits it
[1:08:02] then all of a sudden the bible says the
[1:08:03] cares of the world
[1:08:06] starts beating against the plant and
[1:08:07] without a strong root system
[1:08:10] the bible says
[1:08:12] they blow away
[1:08:14] and that's what we see we see people
[1:08:16] come in this is the greatest thing ever
[1:08:17] was this is you'd be be
[1:08:20] weary of those people i like people that
[1:08:21] come in like brother dale says screaming
[1:08:23] and fighting
[1:08:25] don't know if they want this message or
[1:08:27] not
[1:08:28] sister hazel standing up here playing
[1:08:30] the piano smoking cigarettes
[1:08:32] sorry
[1:08:35] brother they'll put up with y'all too
[1:08:36] and just cigarettes with one of them
[1:08:38] okay i say put up with us hey man
[1:08:42] but you know what
[1:08:44] sister hazel i believe grew
[1:08:47] and staying under the fountain
[1:08:50] instead of being kicked out
[1:08:53] she stayed under the fountain long
[1:08:54] enough one day she just
[1:08:56] quit smoking
[1:08:58] received the holy ghost and here she
[1:09:00] went
[1:09:01] and then she went on to glory right here
[1:09:03] behind the piano
[1:09:05] what a way to go but we're not no more
[1:09:06] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:09:08] away look with every wind of what
[1:09:11] doctrine
[1:09:13] every wind of doctrine oh this one over
[1:09:15] here he preaches he preaches really fast
[1:09:18] and really he jumps up and down the
[1:09:19] screams i think we're going to go over
[1:09:20] there well that's okay
[1:09:24] just make sure it's not a wind
[1:09:28] take that any way you want to
[1:09:32] by the slide of men
[1:09:35] and cunning crap listen that's not god
[1:09:38] that's the devil getting in men and
[1:09:40] doing this cunning craftiness whereby
[1:09:42] they lying wait to what deceive
[1:09:46] but speaking the truth in love
[1:09:48] may do what grow up stature
[1:09:51] into him in all things which is the head
[1:09:55] even christ for whom the whole body
[1:09:57] fitly joined together and what i like
[1:10:00] that word compacted
[1:10:03] it's not just loosely thrown out it's
[1:10:05] compacted
[1:10:07] when you compact something it's really
[1:10:09] hard to pull it apart
[1:10:11] by that which every joint supplies
[1:10:13] according to the effectual working in
[1:10:16] the measure of every part
[1:10:18] as brother john said paying your tithe
[1:10:20] do your due diligence come to church
[1:10:22] serve god read your bible
[1:10:25] that's the measure of every part
[1:10:28] look
[1:10:28] makes increase of you
[1:10:32] the body
[1:10:33] unto the edifying of itself
[1:10:36] in love
[1:10:38] everybody all right
[1:10:40] just a few more minutes
[1:10:42] now we go to ezra like i was talking
[1:10:44] about read ezra and read ezra in that
[1:10:46] it's not just
[1:10:48] the jews coming back and building the
[1:10:49] temple and and all that think about
[1:10:51] yourself
[1:10:53] now when the adversaries of judah and
[1:10:55] benjamin heard that the children of a
[1:10:56] captivity builded the temple
[1:10:59] what are you
[1:11:01] temple
[1:11:02] listen folks let me tell you something
[1:11:08] if you don't have any troubles or trials
[1:11:12] may not be born again
[1:11:15] because the only reason
[1:11:18] those people
[1:11:21] heard that somebody was living a
[1:11:22] different life
[1:11:25] and god was building a temple
[1:11:30] and that's when the adversary came
[1:11:33] amen if you say you don't have no
[1:11:35] trouble with the devil
[1:11:37] because you might be the devil
[1:11:40] but what's the adversary that's
[1:11:41] something against
[1:11:43] they did listen you know what happened
[1:11:45] satan wanted to make sure that that
[1:11:47] temple didn't get built
[1:11:50] that temple didn't get built
[1:11:53] today
[1:11:55] he's putting down in your mind and
[1:11:56] different things about whatever
[1:12:01] he's your adversary
[1:12:03] he wants to see you destroyed he doesn't
[1:12:05] want that temple to be built
[1:12:07] he doesn't want you to hear about this
[1:12:08] temple being built he just wants you to
[1:12:10] shout and and praise god which is good
[1:12:13] but we've become a bunch of clappers and
[1:12:14] that's okay
[1:12:16] i guess
[1:12:18] a good hearty hallelujah every once in a
[1:12:20] while help or an amen
[1:12:24] thank you aaron
[1:12:25] then
[1:12:27] then they came to zerubbabel to the
[1:12:29] chief fathers and said
[1:12:30] um
[1:12:31] let us help you build this
[1:12:34] but you're going to have to listen to
[1:12:36] our doctrine
[1:12:39] for we seek your god
[1:12:41] they didn't know their god
[1:12:44] israel only knew their god
[1:12:47] but zerubbabel thank god zerubbabel and
[1:12:50] joshua the rest of the chief fathers of
[1:12:52] israel in other words the fivefold
[1:12:54] ministry
[1:12:56] said unto them
[1:12:58] you have nothing to do with this
[1:12:59] building
[1:13:01] this is going to be a house of god but
[1:13:04] we ourselves together
[1:13:07] compacted
[1:13:09] every joint supply i just read that
[1:13:11] scripture
[1:13:12] but we ourselves together will build
[1:13:14] unto the lord
[1:13:16] god of israel as king cyrus the king of
[1:13:19] persia has commanded then the people of
[1:13:21] the land they didn't just leave with
[1:13:22] their head satan's not going to leave
[1:13:24] with his head bowed
[1:13:27] then the people of the land weakened the
[1:13:29] hands of the people of judah what did
[1:13:31] they do they got in with them and
[1:13:33] troubled them in the building
[1:13:34] and hired counselors against them
[1:13:37] hirelings
[1:13:39] listen a preacher that's not a
[1:13:40] born-again preacher is a hireling
[1:13:44] oh that hurt
[1:13:46] but it is in the housing
[1:13:50] and frustrate their purpose look it
[1:13:52] across the country now
[1:13:55] what is the purpose of god to build a
[1:13:57] tabernacle
[1:13:59] for him to dwell in right
[1:14:01] and satan's whole
[1:14:04] mandate on his side
[1:14:06] is to go against and to separate what is
[1:14:10] satan divide and conquer
[1:14:13] but i say to you
[1:14:14] that temple
[1:14:16] was built
[1:14:18] that natural temple they're talking it
[1:14:20] was finally built
[1:14:22] so god's going to finally build this
[1:14:25] tabernacle
[1:14:27] this house of god
[1:14:30] called the bride
[1:14:38] we're not going to get to it so we'll
[1:14:39] just stop right here let's read
[1:14:41] zechariah 4
[1:14:43] verse 6.
[1:14:46] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:14:47] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[1:14:49] zerubbabel say not by might nor by power
[1:14:53] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:14:56] who art thou o great mountain
[1:15:00] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[1:15:02] plane in other words you got to start
[1:15:04] on the level you got to start down here
[1:15:08] you can't start up here you gotta start
[1:15:09] down here
[1:15:11] all right just like you can't start
[1:15:13] driving a car at five years old
[1:15:16] it's humanly
[1:15:17] i don't say impossible but boy what a
[1:15:19] wreck you'd have
[1:15:21] same way with us
[1:15:23] what'd brother branham tell us
[1:15:25] he said you're climbing this ladder and
[1:15:27] he said you jump or rung what'd he say
[1:15:31] you'll fall back down
[1:15:33] by missing that what missing this rung
[1:15:38] look at every one of these
[1:15:39] and you look at faith what's the first
[1:15:41] thing you're going to have faith and be
[1:15:43] born again brother i'm saying read your
[1:15:44] statute of perfect man then you've got
[1:15:46] to have virtue not verse you that you're
[1:15:48] a virgin
[1:15:49] that's
[1:15:50] wonderful but have virtue inside of you
[1:15:53] strength
[1:15:55] where somebody can come to you and say
[1:15:57] please pray for me
[1:16:02] that's so simple but it's it's hard for
[1:16:04] people to do who art thou great mountain
[1:16:07] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[1:16:09] plain what he's got to start at the
[1:16:10] bottom but he's going to bring forth the
[1:16:12] headstone
[1:16:14] who's the headstone jesus christ
[1:16:16] shouting crying grace grace unto it
[1:16:19] thank god for grace moreover the word of
[1:16:21] the lord came unto me saying the hands
[1:16:23] of zerubbabel have laid the foundation
[1:16:24] of this house his hands shall also
[1:16:27] finish it and thou shalt know that the
[1:16:29] lord of hosts has sent me
[1:16:31] unto you
[1:16:32] now for whoever despises the day of
[1:16:35] small things but they shall rejoice and
[1:16:36] see the plummet
[1:16:38] in the hands of zerubbabel with those
[1:16:39] seven he's talking about the seven
[1:16:41] church ages or seven messengers because
[1:16:43] they are the eyes of the lord which run
[1:16:44] to and fro through the whole earth let's
[1:16:47] read this one quote and then we'll stop
[1:16:48] right here
[1:16:50] we didn't get to where i wanted to be
[1:16:51] but that's okay uh just keep those we're
[1:16:53] gonna read those last two quotes though
[1:16:55] that i gave you listen the message of
[1:16:57] grace 1961
[1:17:00] read this and then musicians come
[1:17:03] and as we read on further we find out
[1:17:06] that god said jerubal has laid the
[1:17:08] foundation with his hands he also bring
[1:17:10] forth the headstone this is brother
[1:17:11] brown
[1:17:12] i want you to notice he never said he'd
[1:17:13] bring forth the cornerstone
[1:17:16] this derubal person all right
[1:17:19] he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:17:21] and we know that the scripture says that
[1:17:23] jesus is the chief cornerstone and he's
[1:17:25] also the headstone now if we will think
[1:17:27] for a few minutes now what's he saying
[1:17:29] think
[1:17:31] that the seventh church messenger
[1:17:34] was to restore the faith of the children
[1:17:36] back to the fathers in other words
[1:17:38] rebuild the church again under the power
[1:17:40] of the spirit now that's brother
[1:17:41] branham's first mandate according to
[1:17:44] elijah according to malachi 4 right
[1:17:47] we know he had two but that was you got
[1:17:50] to get you got to get him back here
[1:17:51] first
[1:17:55] not by power not by my but by my spirit
[1:17:57] saith the lord not by organization not
[1:17:59] by denomination but by the holy spirit
[1:18:02] listen god can't build a church through
[1:18:03] the division
[1:18:06] through a denomination or organization
[1:18:09] but by the holy spirit god will bring
[1:18:10] forth the church into what last days
[1:18:14] zerubbabel the prince with joshua was
[1:18:16] the one that was to bring forth this
[1:18:18] headstone he had laid the foundation he
[1:18:20] took the people back to the foundation
[1:18:23] in
[1:18:25] type
[1:18:26] what are you talking about
[1:18:28] he's somebody self
[1:18:30] the ministry of jesus christ through
[1:18:31] brother branham brought back the faith
[1:18:33] of the fathers and it also the second
[1:18:35] part is going to bring back the
[1:18:36] headstone
[1:18:38] amen that's the opening of the seals the
[1:18:41] seals brought back the headstone
[1:18:46] you say well i don't understand the
[1:18:47] seals have you ever even tried to read
[1:18:48] them
[1:18:52] what does it scare you for you know why
[1:18:53] it scares you
[1:18:55] god didn't scare you
[1:18:57] satan scared you
[1:18:59] anytime you say well i don't want to
[1:19:01] read that book because i don't
[1:19:01] understand it now god didn't tell you
[1:19:03] that why'd he give you that book
[1:19:08] why is
[1:19:09] the denomination scared of genesis and
[1:19:12] revelations they don't know what
[1:19:13] happened in the first of the book and
[1:19:15] they don't know what happened in the
[1:19:16] last of the book but thank god
[1:19:19] we had a prophet we had a zerubbabel
[1:19:21] he came in the end time
[1:19:23] and he took that trial and he said i'm
[1:19:25] gonna build this thing back god did
[1:19:27] not by might not by power but by my
[1:19:29] spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:19:31] i'm gonna bring it back
[1:19:34] and i'm gonna make it
[1:19:38] to where you can understand it
[1:19:41] god will never give you something you
[1:19:43] can't understand
[1:19:46] now you can have questions no doubt
[1:19:48] because you're human
[1:19:49] but let me read these last two quotes
[1:19:51] and then that'll set up for the next
[1:19:52] time we preach
[1:19:55] in a few weeks just remember brother
[1:19:57] richard heights coming next sunday
[1:20:01] but i want us to be comfortable
[1:20:04] if we're not comfortable
[1:20:08] then we need to do something

[1:20:12] problem with me you need to see brother

[1:20:22] be a stumbling block for anybody
[1:20:26] i do not want to be a stumbling block i
[1:20:28] want to be able to where you come and
[1:20:29] sit down that you can get something from
[1:20:30] god regardless of who's standing up here
[1:20:37] i've always said i wish we had a i wish
[1:20:39] we had a um like they did in the
[1:20:42] in the temple temple time this is the
[1:20:44] holy of holies right nobody could go
[1:20:46] back in there but the priest
[1:20:48] so nobody ever saw but they did hear the
[1:20:51] voice and i wish we just put a curtain
[1:20:53] right here and don't worry about who's
[1:20:55] standing back here the personalities and
[1:20:56] all that just listen to the voice of god
[1:20:59] talking to you
[1:21:02] let's read these last two quotes
[1:21:04] brothers and
[1:21:05] uh
[1:21:06] the believer's position 1955 this is
[1:21:09] what we're heading to okay
[1:21:12] let's read if you got that one up we'll
[1:21:14] read that one first and then we'll read
[1:21:15] this other one adoption 1960 we're
[1:21:18] getting ready musicians come on
[1:21:20] now what is adoption now let me get this
[1:21:22] now i don't know whether i won't have
[1:21:24] time to get through this but i'll hit it
[1:21:25] if there's a question you can ask me a
[1:21:27] little later on something in the message
[1:21:29] listen your adoption
[1:21:31] is not your birth
[1:21:36] your adoption is your placing
[1:21:38] so what we're going to do the next few
[1:21:39] services is we're going to take and pull
[1:21:41] those two apart
[1:21:43] because they're different
[1:21:45] but they have to come together but
[1:21:46] they're different you have to get one
[1:21:47] before you get the other everybody okay
[1:21:49] with that your adoption is your placing
[1:21:52] when you were born again john 1 17 i
[1:21:55] believe when you're born of the spirit
[1:21:56] of god you are the sons of god
[1:21:58] but you were predestinated now here's
[1:22:00] what i'm trying to get to you for the
[1:22:01] sons of the last day we are
[1:22:03] predestinated unto adoption
[1:22:06] okay
[1:22:07] now here we are now this is what hurts
[1:22:09] pentecost a little bit they say i got
[1:22:11] born again praise the lord got the holy
[1:22:12] ghost fine you're a child of god
[1:22:15] that's right
[1:22:16] you're adopted into the family
[1:22:19] but it's not your adoption
[1:22:21] not full adoption
[1:22:22] but yet that ain't what i'm talking
[1:22:24] about
[1:22:25] see you were predestinated unto adoption
[1:22:28] adoption is placing a son
[1:22:31] let's read this next one right here
[1:22:32] believer's position in christ not team
[1:22:34] it's in 1955.
[1:22:36] listen to this
[1:22:38] you got that one
[1:22:40] it's the one before that one it
[1:22:41] shouldn't be if brother anderson you put
[1:22:43] that other one first
[1:22:45] there we go i knew it was in there
[1:22:47] brother brown's praying
[1:22:49] sometimes we skip over brother brown's
[1:22:50] prayer but you better listen to his
[1:22:52] prayer
[1:22:53] he's praying for me
[1:22:55] he's not praying for them people in that
[1:22:56] building in 1955 he's praying for me
[1:23:01] how many of you have had a
[1:23:03] problem or a backache or a headache or
[1:23:05] something and you're listening
[1:23:07] and brother ram says
[1:23:09] sister you got a headache
[1:23:11] well if your sister and you got a
[1:23:12] headache hello god's talking to you
[1:23:15] you know memphis 1954 55 60 23 or
[1:23:19] whatever it is

[1:23:22] backache
[1:23:23] well brother i see you on the front row
[1:23:25] you you suffering with a backache well
[1:23:26] hallelujah that's me
[1:23:29] oh god our father we are grateful to
[1:23:31] thee this afternoon for jesus how that
[1:23:33] she took him up there on mount
[1:23:34] transfiguration and was transfigured
[1:23:36] before them
[1:23:38] you changed him
[1:23:39] whoa
[1:23:41] you changed him
[1:23:43] yeah
[1:23:44] his body shown like
[1:23:47] like uh um you know sean had glory and
[1:23:49] all around it
[1:23:52] and your voice said is the adoption this
[1:23:55] is my beloved son here you hear him look
[1:23:57] and god we're trying our best

[1:24:17] and we're groaning waiting for that time
[1:24:19] of adoption this is 1955.
[1:24:21] and we believe that one of these days
[1:24:23] the holy spirit will move in
[1:24:26] not with a new birth
[1:24:32] for we've received that through christ
[1:24:34] but you'll adopt your church then
[1:24:39] two different things

[1:24:43] being born again
