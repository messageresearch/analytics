holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen we want to see him you know what if you want to see him then he'll make a way us to be able to see him right amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord amen if You' like turning these scriptures turn to Ephesians 1 where we've read a good many times it's a background for all of these messages and then we'll go to first that's Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to First Peter 1 Ephesians 1 First Peter 1 and good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we say welcome to those that are watching by way of internet and uh we always kind of forget those I guess because you know I try my best to to uh preach you know to you and then if anybody else out there hears it then it's up to them what they want to do with it so that's why we we leave it that way but we welcome you and anyone that ever watch these videos just remember now that just terance has announced him remember Friday night brother Pinkston will be here with us the Lord willing and be preaching for us Friday night 7:00 Saturday night 7:00 and then the Sunday morning service and then we will be having a dinner following after that and no evening service on this weekend so just remember these announcements and just pray one for the other that the Lord may lead us remember the sick and just pray that God will bless and he said he sent his word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we we thank him for doing that amen that's what I depend okay are there any announcements that we generally forget we we try to make all the announcements we can but uh appreciate everything that everybody done this past you know the other day down with the uh time with the children and all and the playing and all of the things that was done and Ryan and them going up in the airplane flying around and and supposed to been dropping eggs but they landed I heard a report the other day that they found some eggs over around Lake Hartwell and I think that's about where they went to where they were dropping but uh people was wondering why eggs was falling out of the sky you know but uh anyway so we we appreciate that everything is done we really appreciate it right father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the hour that we live here upon the Earth most of all we thank you for salvation for our souls and Lord for the word to be able to bring us to a place that that we can even think about as salvation for these bodies that we live in to where that we don't have to be like everybody else and try to find some way to get a new body or some kind of a doings but can see that this body is the one to be redeemed we love you and we thank you and we commit everything into your hands bless the sick among us you promised it so we believe it you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you and we just commit it all into your hands now and have your way and that your light may shine among each and every one of us guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen uh sister Susan called me the other day and told me that they given a good report about brother Tom so we we appreciate that you know that he's doing better and everything so you know he said he's healed so I believe with him don't you and he's been there many times before and been real low but the Lord's always brought him out and everything but he's back now in the nursing home and and everything and everything's going great but we appreciate that okay Ephesians 1 it's where we' read for a while we drop backward and forth in this because this is to me is the basis of all of it verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will that's right to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he ha bounded to wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will what to adopt us all right according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ it started in Christ wind up in Christ right both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance now there's where we're going to be getting to tonight so we have obtained an inheritance that's right being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance for what until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the pra way of his glory so there's something to come is it we've got the salvation of the soul but there's something to come okay 1 Peter 1 we'll begin verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope H by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance watch now Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you amen who are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking about predestination and coming on down through the line and trying to we still haven't gotten down to adoption yet but we're we're gaining ground but just remember uh you know and pray for us the Lord would bless us and but now this past weekend we were talking about the birth of the word or the new birth of the Soul all right and in that we saw and we've been trying to bring bring out the point to us over and over to get us to understand that it's not the body and it's not the spirit that receives the new birth right that's why that we still are waiting the Redemption of the body see all right we'll get to that in a minute but yet it's not complete yet you know finished and but we have the new birth and the new birth starts in the soul the soul is the feel you not your heart not your your thumping gizzard you know as we call it and people wonder I guess what that means but see not not the thing that pumps the blood people say in my heart all right that's fine but the heart of an individual is really your soul because that's what you are that's where your life is at uh the life of a peach is in the seed that's in the peach SE in the peach gathered around by the PO and all the other things to make it where it's edible but the the center part of it is the main point and that's that's what we've been trying to deal with is the soul because to make Christians as I brought out Sunday to try to make Christians in body will not help any of us to get you to go to church to get you to be good to do like that that's all well and good but it still will not change us and make us New Creations in Christ Jesus it takes a new birth the birth of the Soul which is a birth of the word that we have heard see that's the the point that no one in the Bible ever receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without first hearing the Worden so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word all right that but that new birth now begins in the soul because that's where Satan attacked him from the head that he took the head God takes a heart attacking from the head Satan comes down through and perverts the nature of our soul cuz he cannot create amen and not being able to create he can't give you a soul he can pervert the nature of your soul because of the domain that we're born into Etc and all like that but see that's where he begins to mess everything up but that's the place that God begins through the heart as the prophet said the soul all he begins from there to make a work of redemption to come into being all right so then the greatest battle is fought in the mind because God also has to use the human mind brain hearing seeing Etc he has to use that to be able to contact us and and to to to speak to us you know so it all comes through the same channel and don't ask me I don't understand it I don't understand how the devil can just bombard me 24 hours a day and you know and just every time I'm it's just he just there working like everything but all at once God can just come along and drop something down in you you ever had that to happen you ever had it to be that you've had a bad day as we call it not a bad High day but a bad day you know but in a bad day where everything's going wrong right and it just seemed like Satan is just just hammering you to death and it just you know it just and you really you can't even seem to get your your mind on the Lord I remember what the prophet said he went out to pray one day and he said I tried to pray over here and he said the sticks were sticking me he said I moved over to another place and he said Here Come the mosquitoes and they was after me he said you know I was trying to pray said after a while I just said get your belly full something like that said just eat I'm going to pray and said you know he begin to pray well see he had his days so do all of us have our days but to think right in the middle then of a day all at once God will drop down and reveal something to you sister Gil what on one God while she was vacuuming or something at the house not necessarily your mind dwelling on not meaning it's not but not necessarily dwelling on something but God could just drop right down and just speak and it's wonderful you know it's a great thing and then you spend the rest of the day doing like I told you one time I was really down and out and I got in the car and drove down the road you know and I was just crying and just just just having it out cuz I was having such a a battle within me about some things and I got about halfway down to Mayville which is about 6 miles or something and the Lord said who's in this battle you or me I mean you think what you're going through is worse than what I've been through well you know what I turned around drove all the way back home crying and praying but you know is a different crying a different praying I was really rejoicing and and rejoicing and crying because he' speak to me right in the middle of all of the junk that was going on that he'd come down and talk to me well that we don't understand it but we thank God for it but God begins in the soul what to drive out that that Satan has placed within us of his nature his ways his thoughts right the domain that we're we're born in so he starts to drive out all right we found from the future home that that brother around says the that you know you repent of your sins in other words you you you get a new heart because you you you've got a Stony heart not that your heart is Stony this those are examples he melow it's just a hardened because of the sinful condition of all of the things it hardens the uh individual and just makes us hard you know in in life but he he gives you a new heart amen see not taking out your heart putting in another heart not that way he just Mellows you down in other words he brings you under conviction all right and see then in doing that you realize well that's something wrong I'm lost and then you repent you remember that right and you say Lord forgive me and just a sweet peace comes over you all right wonderful place to be in but you know what about an hour later things will start getting bad again you know I mean that that you wish it wouldn't but you may Li for a while but it's going to come back why because the thing that made you do it is still there right you just repented of what you done from there back right and you can't repent of what you've do what you're going to do no that's right amen it it it it can't be done you just just don't try that's Catholicism right don't try to repent of what you're going to do right I have enough trouble with What I've Done Right a worried about what I'm going to do all right but see the thing that made you do it the prophet said was still there amen but see then sanctification deals with driving out that unclean spirit and I told you what I likeed of what that Pro what the prophet said he said that unclean Spirit goes out of it's own accord right well see I always thought that we drove it out you know brother R said it goes out of its own accord you said well that don't sound right I agree with you because see we think that we drove him out right no it's through the hearing of the word amen that's right we hear the word we listen to the word we read the word we pray and we study see then the unclean Spirit he he don't have no place to stay amen thank you Lord that's the way we ought to think about got it see the Lord's bringing up some little things to me that and and there one in tonight's message but little things that that's always been bothersome to me see like that quote you know the prophet saying he goes out of his own accord well I I sure don't sound right right but then after you think about it a little bit it's the only thing that could be right right you just put in the word yeah you just keep hearing the word all right see Satan he can't he just can't stand it right so he leaves out but be careful now right come on because the Bible said he goeth out that's why he says he goes out on his own all right see we want to cast The Devils off we want to cast this out we want to cast that out that's fine the Bible says those things but why don't we just get deep enough into the word until Satan don't know what to do with us I'd rather do it that way see because that puts it right in the scripture all right but see then be careful because that unclean Spirit goeth out of a man seek a thre findeth none come back and find a house swept and garnished that's right the Bible said clean right and he enters therein and the state of the man is seven times worse when he becomes religious amen that's right goes to church y wants to be good wants to help everybody right wants to give you know wants to do you know that's right cuz that's just a religious uh you know religious part of us us that that we want to try to do something or help somebody right but see the thing about what I've tried to get us to see is if we can hold on in that word is as disciples that said they held the word they didn't understand right they didn't understand what was going on oh but they just knew one thing for sure was that Peter said we we don't know what's going on we don't know how to handle all this but there's one thing for sure you're the only guy that's got the word to eternal that's right so we just stay with you right until we see what's going to take place well others didn't want to stay didn't they so there was no way for the Holy Ghost to fall on them because they had took man's ideas and went away see there's that uncan Spirit coming in that's right that unclean Spirit coming in will bring in man's ideas right now not just men only that women okay right you know the the first preacher there was was a woman preacher that's right it don't make it right but she was the first one see so get what I'm saying but that unclean Spirit still come back and you become super religious Amen to me there's your anointed ones right amen cuz the anointing of the Holy Ghost is on their Spirit they're rejoicing you can't tell them they're lost that's right that's right you think I don't want to call his name but the man that got caught you know not too long ago and he was making $137 million a year so you'll probably remember who that was you know he got caught by the fact he was going down to see a woman you know oh he claimed he wouldn't have no sex with her he just had her to dance around him you know yeah but see all them years he preached hard against right but one day he got to hold of it right so be careful but that unclean Spirit can be only driven out by the word that you hear that's right you can lay hands on brother Brown said you you can pour oil on by the gallons he said if Satan's got a right to lay there said he'll lay right to all right but see the point I'm trying to get us to see is it's the birth of the word amen so we get the word everybody said brother they L nothing but word word word all he talks about word word word will you tell me something else to talk about amen I thought I believe I thought you believed in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God amen that's right you know I thought we believe the word amen but you see the planting of the word will drive out that's right those things out of your life read the Bible you'll find out it's got the answer to all your questions right I don't care what kind of question you got you just read the Bible or read The Prophet's message you'll find something that'll answer all of the questions all right but see once we get the new birth now we read here in Ephesians about 3:14 there that we get the earnest 13 says we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost 14 says what one you know Ephesians 1:14 the earnest of our inheritance right until the Redemption of the purchased product right all right now Calvary everything that's what we're going to deal with tonight now at Calvary everything was finished amen at Calvary that's right all right now but all wasn't applied amen that's right see it would be applied then as the beginning of the the the uh Redemption would be applied on the day of Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen and the 120 in the upper room would be word that you're looking behind me here that it says faith of the fathers on the pyramid that would be where they were birthed at because they had held the word and receive that amen but then downstairs cuz God had to start his church amen that's like we've always said people say oh which come first that the chicken or the egg oh smart man well how do you know I know what the Bible said he created right it didn't say he created chickens it didn't say he created germs and laid them on a rock right and let produce a cow right right he created all the beginning of God's creation begins and full grown the Lord Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God he was full grown Adam was full grown Adam was full grown he he wasn't a baby right the Lord Jesus sure had to come as a baby and grow up but yet still he was the beginning of the creation of God they're in the fullness right growth development brought him to the position but now think about it we get the earnest of our inheritance right now the earnest is a a down payment I gave you some quotes on it you go over about three four five and look at them and read them on your notes and as you're looking at them you'll see the prophet says the earnest he said that's just a down payment H you go down you're going to buy a car and they say you got to have $500 down of course now you can buy them without anything down cuz they figure they're going to repossess them two weeks later anyway but that don't have still have nothing to do with it you but you pay $500 down what is that the earnest money that'll hold that until you can pay the rest all right but that allows you to be able to take the car or the home you buy whatever to go live in it because you've made a partial payment all right see promising to finish the rest of the payments now we're not talking about defaulted loans people that can't pay we're talking about serious matters in Christianity why because when God gave you the earnest of your inheritance he didn't give you a a part like a part that we called a part he didn't give you $500 down and the rest of it to be paid later right like I told you there the other day and that really struck me it may not mean a thing to you and maybe you seen it all your life but when I seen that it really struck me greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world do we believe that's Bible within the day you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul is not just a match for the devil it is a conqueror of the devil amen that's right but see we think no man's a match for the devil all right then we limit ourselves won't even try well I'm not a match for the devil you think you're a match for him no no but the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul is not just a match for him come on brother he's his God he's his maker he's his all in all that's right you just don't believe it that's it that's where we ought to start believing who we are the prophet said we live below our privileges amen do you say well brother Dale how long you've been preaching 40 something years and the Lord finally showed me that bless him I preach sermons off greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah but I mean really see it amen amen that's right to say that new birth what is it like a Prophet said if it's an Earnest what is it he said it's like a spoonful y right a spoonful of water out of the ocean is identically the same chemical as the whole ocean full right it ain't a part a part of God is God Amen we look at it and say part well you got a part I got a part we get our parts together you know that's what we want to talk about well that's fine that's in the body of Christ but see a part of God is God Amen that's right eternal life is eternal life amen you can't get a part of eternal life you either have eternal life or don't have eternal life it's one of the two There's No Gray areas that I feel like it you know I'm beginning to feel I might have something come on now you beginning to feel like knowing you ain't got nothing that's what you're propping it up amen but get what I'm talking about that Earnest that you receive you know what it means I read run the last one off and I was just sitting there looking at some quotes and I don't think it's in yours but this is taken from uh paragraph 102 Revelation 5 part one brw serpent I don't think it's in your so don't start looking look what he saids and notice we as we go on now we know it's a finish we are predestinated with the lamb the holy spirit is our seal the earnest means more Is Yet To Come amen that's right now that's what I like we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just the down payment oh how beautiful just the down payment that holds it and secures it and anchors it so no one can touch it amen it's the earnest of our adoption amen the holy spirit is now the earnest of God in our hearts seal the adoption of sons waiting at the end of the road Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's right means more to come y right ain't like making payments on the house right you making payments on the house you got to work on the house right this is not like that that's carnal comparison this means if you got the earnest no matter what the day you receive that Earnest that new birth amen that eternal life you die that okay you're automatically sealed it's all it's sealed in by the Holy Ghost and there's nobody can touch it right but it means there's more to come amen there's a statue of a perfect man to climb up while we're here right amen that ain't all of it right if everybody I preached it to you many many times if everybody in the world had the statue of a perfect man where the disciples had they wouldn't be a change of the body that's right he took this message to come by the end time Amen to bring us to a place to understand the change why because Paul and them can only prophesy of it that's right we're not prophesying remember I preached the message years ago all who prophesy must die that's right now come and show me where that's wrong that's right you just keep prophesying that's what we've been doing we keep prophesying we're going to die and go by the grave right but when we quit prophesying start saying this is it right amen I like what brother R said about Paul or Peter and them if this ain't it brother R said let me keep this until that gets here that's right but see Earnest means there's more to come right amen it's not all there's more to come you said well how could it be more there's more word to be revealed on is it that's right well if the word's revealed the Holy Ghost the words the same amen amen what is it we we talked about it the other day the revelation of God's word you can only be saved by Revelation right you can only be saved by faith amen it's not intellectualism right it's an experience amen right amen faith is a substance Paul says in Hebrews 11 right substances brother Mo used to say years ago that it means that the definition of substance means what what anything consist of whether it be natural or spiritual whether it be God or whether it be anything else you make a payment on something that means there's more to come that's right amen I love to do that like the prophet would call it and i' never been there don't know what in the world he's talking about but he said you walk into a pen arcade I don't know what that means you probably know but I'm just a dummy I'm sorry I got a little sense but he said you walk into Penny Arcade and he said you look around yeah well then you just start looking around and then you look around and you look around see there's more right and the more you look the more you see right what I mean that's to me that's way the gospel is the opening of the word today tomorrow is former rain right right what you have today tomorrow will be former rain cuz you got to have a latter rain that's right there's always got to be a revealing right right until the last one comes but listen we get an Earnest of our Salvation that nobody can take it away from us right you can't lose eternal life that's right and an Earnest of eternal life is not a part pay but a part of eternal life it's eternal life amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is eternal life but it's in a baby form is a way of saying an Earnest baby baby's got everything it has unless something goes wrong now we're not talking about that a baby that's born normal has got five fingers on one hand five on the other you know Etc something wrong that's perversion we're talking about natural things that are right it won't grow another finger right it's got what it's supposed to have right but what does it need growth development right right growing up you know right oh yeah sometimes I I've told you about it I'm just human we used have pictures on the wall of the kids when they was born and then the next and two and four and 6 and 8 and 10 and 12 16 and all like that you and you look in there and I looking one day and I thought boy I'd love for Wade stayed right there left the terance be right there and Anna to be right there and then I thought no that wouldn't be right all right cuz God didn't bring them into the world to right stay there in that place that's right he brought them in the world to grow up and be their own s right and have their own family then they could look at the pictures and say they wish your kids to stay right there you right it would make it come to that place but get what I'm talking about what is an Earnest of eternal life it's eternal life amen it doesn't mean you one of these days you're going to get it no amen that's right it means you already have it because God gave it to you it's eternal life right all right now think on these things a little bit now Earnest cuz I was going to put this license and Lord no you got to go first okay we change it first see I've been doing that a lot lately he's been changing me back and forth Sunday afternoon I preached on there out of Ezekiel which I didn't have that plan so I wrote the notes sitting in the office in there while everybody was coming up down the steps you know to preach Sunday afternoon well that's kind of the way this is I had it all what I planed on going but it didn't work out so we just go the other way amen all right so the earnest of our inheritance means that you already have it M it is not as we say the payment of you pay it down on the car and you got to pay the rest of it before you can get the car no you already have it right either you have eternal life or you don't have eternal life right there's no gray areas nowhere in that you either have the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's not a place in there that's the greate cuz you say well I'm believing unto that's okay right but believing unto means you don't have it that's right amen no I'm confessing it that's good can keep confessing it right that means you don't have it if you're believing unto amen all right see once eternal life comes there is no believing unto that's right he becomes the believer amen that's inside of you to take up his possession in your soul oh because that's in your being that's why I believe then see by the new birth then your soul is your theoy that starts an upward pull see and will take us out through the statue of a perfect man and On Through To The Chain of the body right but now to me the reason that it says earnest is because there's more to come right amen all right now I believe there's more to come in the Statue of a perfect man don't you yeah you know Faith virtue knowledge temper PA God is Brother come that's more to come all right but you know what that's more to come up the same thing right am it's the same thing it's just more of the same thing right but now as I said if every one of us was sitting here tonight with the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the faith of the fathers we still don't have the change in the body right amen you know what you have you're Earnest right now that's what we want to get to cuz the title of the message tonight is what inheritance by predestination amen all right now we'll read that in a minute but get my point inheritance by predestination okay the earnest is Christ in you the hope of glory amen that's right all righten that's the earnest but now watch now this is this is the way ahead but I keep this in your mind and you'll see what I'm talking about is it gains ground see when you receive the earnest of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what God done the reason it's called an Earnest he gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost will you agree to that amen all right Earnest the reason it's called an earnest is because there's more of you than the soul right you got a body and the spirit to be dealing with all are you with me right let's read in Ephesians now and see what it says what does it say there in Ephesians 114 13 talks about seal with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance now until that's right until read that's right until means something is not complete I give you this until right right it means more to come see it doesn't say which is the earnest and you have it no until the Redemption of the purchased possession now that would look like that you just had something outside out here and the purchase possession is out dire uhuh right amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the earnest and right there the day you receive that new birth just a baby in Christ God lay claim on that body you're living in am that's right amen that's why I don't believe like all the people of the message are going with it now we're going to get a new body course the way they say it you don't know whether they're saying new body or what they just say new body and then you just leave it for you to think about what you want to yeah well I like no no I like to be blunt right I believe in this body being made new am amen I believe I'm going to live in this same body but it ain't going to be this old pest house that I'm living in but it's going to be the same what the prophet say not even the same gases but it's going to be the same person that I am right I don't believe in getting a new body amen that's right see the reason you don't believe in it cuz you don't believe the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient to pay the price amen you think he can save your soul but he can't he can't save your body now what kind of a thought have you got what kind of a god do you have that's right amen I'm trying to make a point to you the day he gave you the new birth he also laid a claim amen right that's right on that body you're living in absolutely amen that's right now watch what I'm talking about the day the word came in to drive out that unclean Spirit out of your soul before you were born again there see what it done it laid a claim right amen the word being revealed are brought to you laid a claim on that Soul that's why the disciple that laid a claim on 120 but 500 seen him the Bible says after his resurrection and 380 didn't make it to the upper room that's right something happened well it's gone on vacation man garbage again we can go through all of that I bought a wife and married a cow or done something you know right It thatou song all messed up but that stuff don't work right be serious about it amen be serious amen right the day you receive the new birth Brother Gary I don't care what that body look like God laid a claim on it right there that's right yes sir said this is the body you going to live in amen I'm going to make it Eternal it won't be in this that won't be listen I know how to preach about what you're talking about so don't go too far with me when the soul is given the new birth it's not the old soul washed up right I know how to preach what your Prophet said he said it's not that he said it's a brand new unit not a different a brand new he said you don't wash it up polish it up he said that's why people still start out and they doing good and all at once you see them going back see then this body is not going to be just an an old body we're not going to raise up in an old body we're going to raise up in it because that's what we're going to talk about here amen we're going to talk about it in a way that you know I wonder if you thought on it cuz this is the way I like to preach let's just read what your Prophet had to say I thought about this and I thought boy I'm going to get Josiah up tonight to ask some questions where you at Josiah I want to get him to ask a question I a I don't mean to come up here I just saying that he asked me a question one day and it's a serious question for about a 6 or seven year- old little boy at that time and he he said if Jesus was Mary's Creator see cuz we believe that Jesus Christ created all things he said then how was she his mother well you want to ask it that's some of these questions i' be glad to turn them over to you if you want to you know what would you said cuz the little boy had a point right if Jesus created her how could she be his mother so let's get serious let's read something right here this is always bothered me so you just bear with me look at number one on your notes position in Christ paragraph 177 preach 1965 22 the morning service inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance now we automatically think of the process today of inheritance is generally upon the basis that somebody has died right but see that's not necessarily true like I'll tell the kids I say hey they said prob you out there pay in that driveway I said yep spending your inheritance you're not going to get that much you going to have to eat the payment if you do yeah well you know they say yeah but that's our inheritance yep but see then we have at times just walked up to the kids and just give them money for reasons you know because you can give away uh you can give away what is it 10,000 $10,000 without having to be a taxable thing which I'm just playing now you can do what you want to I'm not already again with nobody that's why my bank account is low like it is and yours is big but you go right ahead now I'm not arguing but you go along through life and you hoard it all up and then when you get to and you kick the bucket you know you die and the kids is arguing over who's going to get the money right I don't care how good they are they're going to have discussions about who's getting over too much on what side but the easiest thing to do is just make sure they get the same amount used to give money to the kids years ago and all of them we do things Terrence he's always you know been the one that had a little money on his hip a little bit but he'd say but Daddy give it to them don't uh don't give it to me I don't need it I said yeah but you're not Daddy I said one of these days you'll be Daddy right and you'll find out you can't do that right you know right cuz if you treat one different than the other one after a while it's going to show up so you treat everybody the same and then you don't have no problem that's why you've heard me say it many times it wouldn't bother me to buy a millionaire a meal that would bother me right cuz I do what I want to do I ain't buying no million no meal it's all right your money do what you I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business I'm just telling you if you got something better right now especially the way the economy is you'd be a whole lot better off to divy out some of it now and you go ahead cuz my point is you don't have to die to get an inheritage okay okay amen that's right that's the point now right we always Bas it on somebody had to die all right all right now did God die now before you answer all of that you better listen and we're going to read did God die to give you an inheritance you better hold on all right more serious what you think but let's read what your Prophet had to say he didn't say somebody had to die he said there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance okay right now yep why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon right Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance amen that's right he only came down and paid for your inheritance amen brought you to your inheritance that's right amen now that don't bother you try some way to figure it all out what they're doing nowadays would be really bad all this River Georg and stuff because they automatically thrown away from Jesus even be enough form of God and just made a man out of him but surely they don't even have no inheritance no that's right amen but did God die to give us an inheritance now God can't die you said well I've heard you preach yeah but you better go back and listen to what I said to right I've never taught you that Jesus the body was eternal do you understand what I say Jesus the body that's right now and Jesus the God I don't know how to say these things so forgive me I'm just I'm just as dumb as can be but just forgive me and and think about it let God speak to you Jesus the God never died right the reason I say Jesus the God because the only name God ever had was Jesus so now what happened yeah Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance well I got quote for bring them on cuz you won't find them right I save you the trouble of going to hunt the prophet couldn't tell you that Jesus never let you an inheritance then tell you Jesus left you an inheritance right amen right cuz he did he's contrary one to the other well years later he got straightened out see that's so Glory man ain't it beautiful that's why we're here 40 years later right amen what's the prophet talking about he only came down and paid for your inheritance price had to be paid brought you to your inheritance all right that's it but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first now what are you talking about I'm asking you do you understand what brother Brown is say it see God didn't die that's right amen God can't die amen now that human flesh that we call Jesus he never gave you any inheritance right because his flesh was Mortal right subject to death yep a man that was 33 years old and looked to be 50 yep right everybody says I'm 71 it looked to be 60 but I differ with them on that cuz I look at the old thing every day but it's old and wore out but he was 33 years old and looked to be 50 right because of all the things he had to go through with right what you see we are not the children how many times have I made this statement right we are not the children of Jesus which was a child of God right that would make you a Grand child right simple right I said I'm deep how much more simple can you get are we grandchildren no we got to be Sons and Daughters of God but we had to receive a new birth to be able to come to that position there had to be a way made that that could take place amen that's right so Jesus never left us an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance amen that's right well if he paid for it you know well if he paid for it it didn't belong to him right see are we this Trinity which one is it say he brought you to your inheritance that's right but your name was put on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance he said your inheritance was first amen now what is our inheritance he eternal life right amen right what is the inheritance that we desire eternal life amen well see how could God bring that eternal life to a place that it could be received by mankind he said well people just didn't know how to believe well you want to go back in the Old Testament and let's spend about 2 weeks talking about some of those Brothers back there and their faith and their doings and their their abilities and their actions and right I don't believe you want to do that do you cuz you know you'd wind up in trouble cuz some of those fellas make us ashamed of ourselves and they didn't even have the new birth right see Jesus never gave you an inheritance that's right he paid the price that the ability for God to transmit his life into you and I Amen to give us eternal life right the price had to be paid they had to be a redeemer they had to be a Kinsman right one that would even give his own life right I'm not saying he's a separate person so get off your garbage can I Don't Preach to you too long you ought to know now what I'm talking about right amen God was in Christ the Bible said reconciling the world unto himself right in body he was a man now how many quotes have we done on that how many sermons have we preached on that that in the spirit he was God and said in Soul he was God all right so when that baby was born God's own life not a second person God's own life by spirit and soul came into that body it was a baby the prophet said little Jehovah crying in the Cradle he said think about your God with no teeth yep amen God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen outside of that you're going into the Oneness or Trinity one of the two well you just sound like a Oneness will come on with the scriptures and quotes let's see if we like that was either almighty God laying in that cradle amen or the biggest deceiver the world ever had that's right amen that's what your Prophet said that's right amen you want to amen him you owe me me but amen him at least right cuz there's one thing about it you can't argue with him you can argue with me and figure out well I don't believe that well it's go right ahead but am I saying what the prophet said that's why I like to give it to you unless you read it all see Jesus Christ died Jesus the flesh the man that's right the human part died to release the life of God brother Rand said God tore his soul out right that was the way he said what did mean cuz what have I always taught you the soul of God was God standing there in that body that come out of that body that spirit and that Soul there on Calvary came out of that body that body didn't go to hell that body didn't go to heaven that's right your Prophet said it was hung between he said hell wouldn't have it and Heaven couldn't take it right you want them quotes he talking about the body it was the soul of God that went to hell that's right to preach to those souls in prison but when that Soul came back up that Spirit was released and steep back in that body there already stood am amen amen see that body couldn't give you eternal life right but eternal life was housed within that body right amen that's it the only thing Could Happen was he could pay the price the animal life was no way to come back right it didn't have a soul right amen it couldn't release it wouldn't matter how many times you killed that animal it wouldn't bring no eternal life but here God Ste down in human flesh and one day on Calvary that laugh came out of that body right and that body hung there for the three days that the soul went to hell right they took it down put it in a tunb then he raised amen amen thank you Lord see all right eternal life step out of the body but it pi that body back up and that body according to the scripture went up to the father right we got to open up the Everlasting Gates all in the Psalms you know the Lord Of Glory coming in who is this the Lord Of Glory king of glory you know and when he did it would but just a little bit right back right he went up and he just come right back right but when he come back he come back with Body Spirit soul there Eternal in a glorified condition right now God is God of all he stepped back into that body but he made that body Eternal cuz that body had a beginning and that body had to have a time that it had to be made Eternal amen so that body can't give you eternal life but by hanging on Calvary now do you see why he would say into thy hands Lord take this away from me the body outside the spirit reason reals and all of the facts of humanity there in the garden he was crying out Lord if there any way then he said not my will thy will be done in other words the this is the only way it can be done that eternal life can come back upon these people that I've tutored and trained for three and A2 years if this is the only way that can ever come to humanity that eternal life can come this if if this is the only way they can get their inheritance let me pay the price God pulled out of that human body Soul and Spirit left that body hanging and your Prophet said it was dead yep sure abely the Bible said it was dead amen why because the Soul and Spirit left out of it right but then one day he stepped back in it he hung around a while 30 40 days or something with the disciples seen a 500 you know ate with them talked with them then one day he ascended up he said now I I've got to go up because the price ain't finished yet right oh are you ready to return acts 18 you going to return to the kingdom to Israel now right you wouldn't fight before yeah we tried to help you Peter cut off a guy's ear and you didn't back him up you put his ear back on right now you ready he said you don't understand you don't understand I've got to go finish this thing up cuz the only way that eternal life can be brought the only way hey Peter you can get your inheritance is for me to go up and come back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes and bring eternal life right now you see why the prophet would say that you say well that's never bothered me Brother D but you don't understand me if it's not revealed to me I don't just take it because the prophet said it that's right I've got to wait until God reveals it to me I believe it until I quote it until I believe it until I don't get my own ideas in until but then one day God will speak amen right that life had to come out of that body right my inheritance was there in him cuz I was chosen in him before the foundation world we read here in Ephesians been over and over and over and over I was chosen in him right so my inheritance was in Jesus Christ but how could I get get it well all he had to do just say get the Holy Ghost he done that over in the scripture you remember he said breathed on them said receive you the Holy Ghost and they asked brother BR said what's what's the difference in what he said and breathed on them he said that was a promise right right right they didn't get the Holy Ghost retired he said that was a promise right am they had to wait until see but see my inheritance was in Jesus Christ amen the only way I could get it was for him to die that's right to release that life thank you Lord that he could come back now I can say I am my father's one Amen to an inheritance Incorruptible we read in Peter we have an inheritance that's Incorruptible amen that's right corruption can't touch my inheritance now here's where we're going with it death can't touch this body until God is through with it right amen yours either that's right am so why be afraid am why be afraid well you just ain't never been where I've been I'd like to tell you a few times about some things sometimes maybe it's best not to but I tried to tell you one time about it I was standing up on a deer stand about 15 18 ft off the ground and all at once my left arm began to just ACH and my heart was paining aching just the devil says I got you now you're out here by yourself s if you're lucky they'll find you where you fall off of that and die well most people would have screamed bloody murder and jumped off of there and wouldn't have had to call 911 cuz it could heard them hollering for I don't mean that a joke I'm just telling it like it is I just simply sat down I said Lord if this is it I'm f 18 ft off the ground I'm higher up than I would be if I was on the ground and if I'm having a heart attack and it's a major one that wouldn't matter to me if every doctor in the world was standing here if this is it I'm true and finished so thank you Lord you said well why didn't you go to doctor cuz you didn't have no more trouble right so I don't tell a lot of things cuz I go home with a wife you going to the doctor well that's normal it's all right no problem I go I told you about the time you know that I was bleeding like my wife she she knew that I'd bled but she didn't know what and it was all about and she said you got to go to the doctor well that's about 3 or 4 months later you know had my troubles done over with then problem I i' be glad to go they couldn't find nothing go what it matter to me you see do you fear death that's where your problems at when you fear death you got a problem right you going be afraid every moment hey we're not dumb I ain't walking out on the railroad track and holler to the train to keep coming you know what I'm saying right we don't tempt God that's right amen well why worry about death death is a death is my slave that's right is that what your Prophet said he said it's the thing to get me out of this pest house and into his presence you see Jesus never gave you an inheritance that's right amen but the only way you could get the inheritance was for him to die well brother T he must have not have been God cuz God can't die you just said it while ago about four times let me say it one more time God can't die right but what happened on Calvary God stepped out of the body you explain it he stepped out of that body amen and allowed that body to hang there cuz they had to be a Kinsman in the body cuz this ain't just for the for the soul right that's only the earnest that's it amen a a inheritance Incorruptible right why would the scripture say that Incorruptible means at once it was corruptable right right and my inheritance is a change of the body amen right that will go to incorruption amen this Mortal will put on immortality right here amen right if you got an inheritance here in this world friend it's a corruptible inheritance number two of you know Revelation 5 part 2 paragraph 242 but we receive an inheritance that fadeth not away the prodical son went away and left his inheritance and he took part of it with him when he returned back his inheritance his inheritance was defiled but if you run away from yours it's not so in the kingdom of God we receive an Incorruptible inheritance don't you want to receive it he talks about people raising their hand going down that was 243 this is 246 we have an Incorruptible inheritance that is salvation Redemption watch go back to the Garden of Eden again now he ain't talk talking about just the soul is he that's right come on he ain't talking just to the soul think of it Lord who wouldn't want to go back like Adam and Eve and live back there an Incorruptible inheritance if you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a promise to you that your body is also claimed right it don't matter how bad it gets that's right amen it's claimed right and one day it will have to to be made Immortal right so we have an inheritance Incorruptible as we read there in Ephesians says until the Redemption of the purchased possession brother Rand in future home like gave you some of this so you've got it in the future home he said and when Jesus received that Holy Ghost there on the River Jordan said he said this is my part of the earth that I've redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest amen he said we have page 49 future home we have the Redemption of the Soul he said we're waiting the Redemption of the body now what does he say waiting in other words we're here waiting in this pest house waiting for it to be made manifest f as far as God is concerned it's over with and that's where we ought to be saying as far as I'm concerned it's over with but now you tell me and I'm just as honest as you are you tell me where you come from I don't mean that you come into message maybe you heard some I'm talking about where you originated from Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and even 90% of what you come from in this message I'm going to get a new body I'm going to get this I'm going to get where is there anything in the Bible about it amen right but see you order to Rejoice to say what I used to think that I wondered why would it be all of these things cuz I did when I was in the Baptist didn't you I wondered about these things I pondered over them in my mind of what the people would talk about when they preach one sermon and be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and send you to heaven preach the next sermon is none good no not one send you to hell you never didn't know which one was up and down come on am I right well brother Dale I didn't hear it that's right you slept there all right blowing up what was wrong with you hearing now you tell me that they was preaching the truth back there they preaching what they understood I don't you misunderstand me right but you tell me they was preaching the truth I'll tell you right straight line just get that L Spirit off of you we do Brea and pray for that kind amen sure they were doing what they were doing but what could they do teach you a trinity teach you that hell was was eternal and scare you to death to try to get you saved now come on folks that's right it's time to start rejoicing about what we've heard right sure it may have been a hard long journey to get where we've got to but why shouldn't we Rejoice about what we've heard that's right to thank 71 years old but I'm only 18 that's right that's why I keep telling you everybody thinks 70's old bless they say you're on bar time I give every day said Thank You Lord I got one more day I got one more day Lord you give me one more you know what you give me a whole 365 I don't know how you get the fourth that way but he gave me a whole year over what he promised me right right I'm living on B time you know why I'm here you want to know why I'm here he ain't done with me and you know what the thing that he ain't done with is you y right all right I haven't got there yet to preach about the gifts being predestinated eternally cuz that's what your Prophet says that's right the gifts are predestinated eternally that don't make the person Eternal that's got the gifts no way but the gifts are God's predestinated he gave some Apostle some Prophet some evangelist some Pastor some teacher amen that's why I'm happy why because I know what my inheritance is that's right I'm looking at eternal life I'm going to see you in eternity amen that's right that's right we have downstairs to those on the internet we have downstairs pictures of people here that are ped on but we didn't get pictures of them 70 60 or 40 ever how old it was we got pictures of them around 18 20 years old sticking on the wall downstairs you know why cuz that's what they're going to look like when they're ra amen there ain't going to be no picture glory in Calvary I mean in in heaven that'll show how old we look sister Gil God don't remember that right amen they ain't going to be what you used to be but now you are cuz that is not in God's mind right right what I am now in this old body is not in God's mind right amen he sees me what I am amen I like about that old colored man that BL around said he heard said why in the world now he said it you read it he said why in the world they put that old man up there you remember said come out there that old trench coat on little r h and everything said why in the world why didn't you put any young men up here that's your Prophet talking you know what he's just a man amen he said after a while said he took his text out of heaven and come down to horizontal rainbow where the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy he jumped up and clicked his heel said you ain't got enough room up here to me he said God give me some of that I want that amen you know what he was saying now you be honest he said them other guys could do a pretty good job but this fell had the good this is the fell I want to be like he didn't say he want to be like all them others he' heard all them days no all though he said agreed with him as good eternal life Jesus never died to give you an inheritance that's right he died to pay the price amen cuz my inheritance was eternal life right before the world ever begun all right transmitted down the only way God could transmit it down was to come down and create a body step into that body you say that's just Oneness I'm sorry I'm sorry for you and your peanut brain that you can't com for him right because one that stops in Jesus and say he's the life form of God no I differ with you you're looking at the life form of God which is a bride of Jesus Christ and God the greatest thing that's ever been on Earth God living in his people this is the LIF morphe of God no oness will ever touch that no amen neither were your one this Doctrine right God said to the prophet when you begin to say I and my father are one amen and these are things amen he said the shock will pull away when you begin to say Jesus never left me an inheritance that's right now they got one side of it it said he wouldn't even God at all so I don't know he couldn't give us no way of giving inheritance if he wasn't God at all God just come on him and left back off of him there's no way to get a new birth the birth can only be from the soul of almighty God right that's right or else you're just anointed one come on amen amen that's right ain't going to change nobody right but it makes me rejoice in my heart amen for him to reveal something to me right let me see it amen maybe as simple that you've seen it 40 years ago to you see greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world that new birth you receive is just a baby in Christ Satan's no match for that new birth right that's right but he's greater match than for all of us in In the Flesh yes that's right but just yield yourself to that man that's inside of there remember brother brandom that old devil was coming up saying Boop he said I'm going to just see what'll happen he said boo back at him he said he stopped said I just booed again and said every time I said boo to him said he got smaller y see because Satan is no match for that new bird amen that's right I don't care how small or whatever you want to make it he's no match for that new birth amen that's right just yield yourself to God but Dev aren't you afraid to go on the internet and and put it forth and say come and show me where I'm wrong that's right no because if I'm wrong I want to be right you know if you can come tell me I'm wrong I can accept it and I can make it right so I I can't fail as far as being afraid huh I'm Not Afraid cuz you see I won't back off from telling you something I don't like that kind of a Lon type Spirit somebody comes along you know and you say you said so well well I I didn't really mean it that way yeah you know I I I really meant no I mean what I say and I say what I mean whether you like it or lump it cuz that's the way I've always been and there's no need to change it now I'm just as straight as I can be and as honest as I can be and what I believe I'll tell you and you come up later and say brother Dell you said this you change now I'll say okie dokie I'll straighten that out this Sunday I'll go tell the truth and I'll tell who told it you know who straightened me out but I've always said one thing you make sure you come with the word right that's don't come with your ideas that's right and we do have the tapes and I have had to rely on that to say you said it okay we'll get to tape and see if I said it slips of the tongue mistakes of words yes human beings we all make them so do you right exactly but I say what I mean and I mean what I say there's only one true and living God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and if we can't find ourselves in him we got a problem amen that's right exactly but if we can see ourselves in him then we can see all the way back before Glory that's right and come all the way down exactly right remember the message of predestination when I said if you can't look back just as far as you can look forward you don't know what eternity is that's right amen cuz you're only looking forward right eternity comes from as far as it goes there's no way to express it come on brother think on these things inheritance by predestination I didn't get to finish up but that's all right predestination God knew who would want to be saved I gave you them quotes so he'd have it ready for us he knew who would accept eternal life he had it ready for us y he knew also who would have enough Faith to be able to withstand in this last days and be able to come to the change of the body right that's right and he would predestinate see now from where are we going on on from here now I'm going to say it all right so you write it in your mind where we're going on from here there's no backing up amen cuz everything from here on is eternity right when you're talking about predestination I'm talking about predestination revealed if you have the new birth and we're predestinated in this day to adoption that no other age was predestinated to reach this place every age was predestinated unto the new birth right y but we're predestinated for the change of the body that's right God said it would be here and whether you believe it or I believe it that ain't going to change it at all that's right go out there in the morning and just sit down there and doubt all you want to and let's see if the sun comes up right right amen but if you're real serious in God and God is using you you can say to that son son stand still right right and it will that's right we were praying for a man years ago at
