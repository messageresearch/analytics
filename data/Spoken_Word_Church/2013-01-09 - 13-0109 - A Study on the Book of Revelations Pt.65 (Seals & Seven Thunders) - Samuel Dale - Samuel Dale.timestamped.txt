[9:31] Jesus name amen
[9:35] Revelations
[9:38] 1 then we'll go to Revelations
[9:41] 8 says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[9:44] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[9:47] servants things which must shortly come
[9:48] to
[9:49] pass and he sent and signified it by his
[9:52] Angel and to his servant John who be
[9:55] record of the word of God and of the
[9:56] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[9:58] things that he saw
[10:00] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[10:01] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[10:04] those things which are written therein
[10:06] for the time is at hand all right let's
[10:10] go over to Revelation
[10:14] 81 and when he had opened the seventh
[10:16] seal there was silence in heaven about
[10:19] the space of half an hour you may be
[10:22] seated Lord at his Blessing to the
[10:24] reading of the word now what I want to
[10:27] do is review some back on
[10:31] Sundays cuz I want you to to understand
[10:36] what I'm trying to drive
[10:38] it and that way we can move on then into
[10:43] other things in the Book of
[10:45] Revelations but now what have we found
[10:47] we found that to according to mankind
[10:51] according to if anybody else wants a
[10:54] copy of the notes there one lay up here
[10:55] if you want to get it some of you can't
[10:57] see and and everything so if you want
[11:00] one you know we don't give Brother Ray
[11:02] and sister uh back there one but
[11:07] now according to the world and according
[11:10] to the basis of the people of the
[11:13] message that we're claiming to be
[11:16] following and and everything they're
[11:18] scared of the Book of Revelations right
[11:21] and they don't want to speak about it or
[11:23] anything like that because they're
[11:25] afraid of being you know maybe something
[11:28] uh them go out and go out on the limb
[11:31] and you know but I've always figured one
[11:35] thing there's no need no difference
[11:37] between being out on the limb and out in
[11:40] midair you know right because if we're
[11:44] not right we're one of them too and both
[11:47] of them is in bad shape you so that's a
[11:51] you know I just never had to worry about
[11:52] that so I just go on and at least tell
[11:54] you what I believe and then by telling
[11:56] you what I believe then you can you know
[11:58] you can AR argue the point or whatever
[11:59] you want to about
[12:01] it but we read that there was silence in
[12:04] heaven now I went through a lot of that
[12:06] Sunday that there's silence in
[12:09] heaven and we're quick to say well
[12:11] there's nothing written
[12:13] there you know well we found out that
[12:18] according to the prophet there was a lot
[12:21] of things that we need to cover there
[12:24] because of what he said it was right so
[12:27] we went through those things trying to
[12:29] to bring forth the
[12:32] understanding
[12:34] that by way of a prophet to me there's
[12:38] no difference in the seventh seal when
[12:40] it says there silence in heaven than it
[12:43] is the first seal when it says there's a
[12:45] white horse rider wrote out because we
[12:47] didn't know what that was that's right
[12:50] until the prophet came to tell us all
[12:52] right then we'll get back to it in a
[12:54] minute and he gets down and he said I
[12:55] want to tell you my revelation of it
[12:57] well that was what he was doing on the 1
[12:59] 2 third fourth fifth 6th you know it was
[13:02] his revelation of it so we're dependent
[13:04] upon his revelation of the word of God
[13:08] all right and in doing that we can look
[13:11] at it and see that there's a lot of
[13:13] things taking
[13:15] place we read our Sunday that and I'm
[13:18] just scan over these won't try to put
[13:19] them up on the screen but just scan over
[13:22] a little bit we found out brother ROM
[13:24] says that there's a the eth chapter only
[13:27] reveals the scene of the seven but seal
[13:30] where nothing else is revealed amen but
[13:33] now he says it's a scene all right now
[13:36] he's made it something already right y
[13:40] it's a scene now whatever that scene is
[13:43] is you
[13:45] know that's between the Lord and you is
[13:48] talking about it but then we found that
[13:51] the seventh
[13:52] seal that he would say was perfectly
[13:54] mute in that quote
[13:57] 777 then he says it spoke
[14:01] of in the very beginning in Genesis the
[14:05] S sealed it well that puts it in the
[14:10] Bible that puts it into the Bible oh
[14:12] yeah because if it's spoke of it's in
[14:14] the Bible that that that ought to be
[14:17] sensible to us all right and we know
[14:20] that he said
[14:22] that we came down into the message
[14:24] talking about it and he said paragraph
[14:27] 394 the seven seal
[14:29] he said you see it's a hidden mystery no
[14:32] one
[14:33] knows but right along with what he said
[14:36] no one would know his
[14:41] coming so we went through that to show
[14:44] that the seventh seal the prophet said
[14:46] is the coming of the Lord amen
[14:50] amen all right now if it's the coming of
[14:53] the Lord then it's
[14:56] something right it's not just a gap of
[15:00] 30 minutes you
[15:03] know a place that's put there nothing in
[15:05] it you know there's a scene
[15:09] there and he says that those angels
[15:11] cherubims Etc and all standing
[15:15] all right when that seven seal is open
[15:18] so they see
[15:19] it what I'm trying to get you to look at
[15:21] is and try there Sunday
[15:25] that that you can say well we just don't
[15:27] know this we don't know that well if I
[15:29] can read what he
[15:31] says all right that's the only hopes I
[15:34] got anyway because what you got to say
[15:36] and what I've got to say don't Mount to
[15:38] Hell
[15:39] beans I mean we ought to be old enough
[15:42] long enough in the way to realize
[15:44] that but what he
[15:48] says so then he said it went right on
[15:50] end to the point of saying that it was
[15:52] those seven Thunders paragraph 394 there
[15:56] he said it's connected together
[16:00] all right the coming of the Lord he said
[16:02] is connected together with the Thunders
[16:05] right all right and he said we
[16:08] understand that much and said the rest
[16:10] of it will be unfolded you know rest of
[16:13] it is all unfolded but this is not
[16:17] unfolded there's parts of that not
[16:20] unfolded you know right CU When he spoke
[16:23] of that he spoke of a fold of
[16:26] it all right he said it was in a
[16:28] threefold
[16:29] manner paragraph
[16:32] 245 he said by God's help I speak to you
[16:35] a full of it that it's those seven
[16:37] Thunders that he heard thunder and was
[16:39] forbidden right right right now my
[16:45] emphasis throughout the message tonight
[16:46] will be one
[16:48] thing trying to tie together the entire
[16:52] Bible and looking at the seven
[16:57] Thunders
[16:59] now wait in a few minutes do we get down
[17:01] to a point that I want to bring out on
[17:02] that
[17:06] okay we covered that he said it like
[17:08] paragraph
[17:10] 229 that the seventh seal is the end of
[17:14] all
[17:15] things L if it's the end of all
[17:18] things it's
[17:21] something so you say end is like you
[17:24] know you walk out to a cliff and fall
[17:27] off well just
[17:29] remember there is a bottom down there
[17:33] somewhere all
[17:35] right but did you go home and look up
[17:37] the word
[17:39] end or did you even go home and look up
[17:41] the word
[17:44] come I don't know what it
[17:46] means I told Brother didck come to my
[17:48] house well that's
[17:51] good but the coming is
[17:54] not any form of
[17:57] travel
[17:59] that's why the prophet said I'm not
[18:00] saying he's coming I'm saying he's
[18:03] here it's not a travel form if I ask you
[18:06] to come to my house I don't sit there at
[18:08] the house call you where you at where
[18:11] you at where you at where you at now you
[18:13] know if you're late or something we
[18:15] understand but I mean I'm not calling
[18:16] you every second to see where you at cuz
[18:19] I'm not responsible for that part right
[18:22] but the word come is actually look it up
[18:25] it literally means to
[18:27] be more closer than a husband and a wife
[18:31] who when a man comes home from work or
[18:33] something and they're in each other's
[18:37] arms and see we're we're English people
[18:40] and the prophet was speaking English why
[18:41] can't we use English words right to
[18:44] comprehend what he was trying to say
[18:46] amen and you look up the word
[18:54] in we say end is you know that just mean
[18:57] that's as far as you can go
[18:59] well now that's not true in in all
[19:01] forms the end of the and I never have
[19:05] understood the centuries I can't
[19:07] getra the end of the 20th
[19:12] century it didn't end the world is
[19:15] it what was the end of the 20th
[19:19] century the beginning of the 21st
[19:22] century is that
[19:26] sensible see the end the first
[19:29] seal was what when the second seal broke
[19:34] that's
[19:35] right right see it's like a star step
[19:39] the prophet said climbing upward right
[19:42] see then we look at the word end and we
[19:43] think well it's just well it's just the
[19:45] end of something but he's trying to
[19:47] express to us that it's the end of all
[19:49] things amen he said it even ends the
[19:53] Usher end of the Millennium well when
[19:55] you get to the end of the Usher end of
[19:56] the Millennium you walk into the
[19:57] Millennium you say say the seventh seal
[19:59] is
[20:01] here I got to remember I still here
[20:03] brother I Lor
[20:05] myself see I'm just trying to get us to
[20:07] go with this simple words everybody said
[20:09] Brother D was so
[20:11] deep but that's first grade reading
[20:15] right Abby can tell you what the word
[20:18] come means now she she'll say that that
[20:20] see oh she can sound it out you
[20:25] know and you know a three-year-old can
[20:27] know what to word means it can't even
[20:29] sound
[20:31] it you say to to little uh one of ry's
[20:36] kids back there come
[20:39] here I don't know what he mean no no no
[20:43] they they come to
[20:45] you
[20:47] see it's not meaning way it's meaning
[20:50] come
[20:51] here break the message down
[20:55] simple brother said go on with simple
[20:58] message is that what he said in the
[20:59] seventh seal he said because if you
[21:01] don't you'll work yourself away from
[21:03] it keeping it
[21:06] simple all
[21:09] right and seeing
[21:12] that the coming of the
[21:16] Lord so I believe the second coming of
[21:18] Jesus Christ started on the day of
[21:20] Pentecost amen that's
[21:24] right his first coming started in
[21:27] Genesis
[21:29] you know really before the foundation
[21:30] world coming down you com on down
[21:34] okay he spoke more of his second
[21:38] coming than he did of his first coming
[21:43] right and I thought that was one of the
[21:46] questions that was asked in Matthew
[21:50] 24 we let be there won't be one stone
[21:53] left on another right and what is the
[21:55] sign of thy coming right and of the end
[21:58] of the world well we found the seven the
[22:01] six seal is to be the end of the
[22:05] world that's what your Prophet said it
[22:08] is what's the sign of his
[22:13] coming the sign of his coming is an
[22:16] announcement right we're going to get
[22:19] down to some scriptures one of these
[22:20] days and I get time
[22:23] too and try to tie together where it
[22:25] says the Lord himself shall descend from
[22:27] heaven with the
[22:30] out I thought we believe that was the
[22:32] message
[22:35] amen well then God has already descended
[22:38] right so you're looking for his coming
[22:41] he's already here
[22:45] right but it outside of the Corporal
[22:49] body you know what he means what's the
[22:55] difference we listening yesterday to him
[22:58] where was bringing out and showing how
[23:01] that there's more Revelation here today
[23:05] than there was in
[23:07] creation right amen that's right more of
[23:10] God is being revealed today than it was
[23:12] in creation
[23:14] amen see why can't we believe
[23:17] that sure he said it's a complete
[23:22] mystery he gets on over to the seventh
[23:24] seal 399 paragraph he says see it's a
[23:28] complete mystery therefore the hour is
[23:31] not yet for these Mysteries to be known
[23:34] now listen to it therefore we're this
[23:37] far and the rest of it will be known
[23:41] right around about the time that Jesus
[23:45] appears on Earth again for his bride
[23:48] right yes or whatever takes place at
[23:52] that
[23:54] time now whatever you think that is 10
[23:58] Visions whatever you
[23:59] know around coming back or
[24:04] whatever you still got to
[24:08] realize that something's going to happen
[24:11] right right here in the end time all
[24:15] right I told wait I said you better be
[24:17] ready cuz I'm might wind up with the you
[24:22] know the problems are running that the
[24:23] whole family's got and I said cut it off
[24:25] hold it right there you answer the
[24:26] question I'll give you know
[24:28] I may have trouble just preaching you
[24:30] know trying to talk to
[24:32] you but he said amen and whatever takes
[24:36] place at that time right when Jesus
[24:39] appears on Earth again for his bride
[24:42] amen well as I said I thought we
[24:46] believed that the Lord descended from
[24:48] heaven with a shout and that that was a
[24:50] message to get the people ready amen
[24:52] that's right right that's I thought
[24:55] that's what we
[24:56] believe see but now
[25:00] look we talked about the coming of the
[25:02] Lord that even
[25:04] Jesus didn't know him when he was coming
[25:07] right he says that there in the
[25:09] scripture I think it's Mark 13 what is
[25:12] it 32 where he says it that even the son
[25:15] don't
[25:17] know and brother Brown uses it on the
[25:20] souls in prison paragraph
[25:22] 136 he said it's always a mystery that's
[25:25] the
[25:26] Finish because Jesus said himself not
[25:29] even an angel of heaven knows when I
[25:32] will
[25:34] return I don't even know it
[25:37] myself what
[25:39] time the father has put that in his
[25:43] mind God Alone knows
[25:49] it the coming of the
[25:53] Lord he goes over to paragraph 208 of
[25:56] the souls in prison
[25:59] he says the lamb took the book and when
[26:01] the seventh seal just ready for it to be
[26:04] opened the Sixth Seal remember he hid
[26:06] the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do
[26:09] it when the Angels stood day by day
[26:11] telling but then he wouldn't do it on
[26:15] that one said there is silence in heaven
[26:18] no one knew it was the coming of the
[26:20] Lord
[26:22] right but if you believe the Lord
[26:24] started his coming at Calvary
[26:28] M what's the problem of understanding
[26:31] the coming of the Lord right you say
[26:32] well it's the secret that's right where
[26:36] is there a
[26:39] church that teaches the coming of the
[26:41] Lord is your new birth where you started
[26:43] at where is it even in this message come
[26:46] on come
[26:49] on that they teach it like
[26:52] that no one day it's going to Sky going
[26:56] to split oh we going to see
[26:58] bless him he's going to come down sweep
[27:00] down talking with some brothers that
[27:02] here one time
[27:04] and this brother he said I I I just
[27:06] can't understand said I always believe
[27:08] that that when Jesus would come yeah
[27:11] that he would I got some in my pocket
[27:13] thank you brother that when Jesus would
[27:16] come that we'd come riding on horses
[27:18] fighting a
[27:19] battle boy that's something man we going
[27:22] to come back over and glorified bodies
[27:24] ride with a glorified Lord Jesus on
[27:26] white horses and we going to come down
[27:28] here and punch people in the nose or
[27:29] shoot them with a
[27:33] gun now that's about carnal when they
[27:36] couldn't shoot us if they had guns right
[27:40] right
[27:41] right come we' be an eternal glorified
[27:43] body amen but see that's what people are
[27:46] taught that's the things they
[27:48] believe they don't consider the truth of
[27:50] the whole
[27:52] matter brother said on Feast of the
[27:55] trumpets paragraph 147
[27:58] he said because on the seventh seal
[28:00] there was silence no one knew that was
[28:02] the minute or
[28:05] hour that Christ would
[28:09] come as he revealed it to us amen I'm
[28:14] quoting
[28:17] him the minute or hour of his
[28:25] coming but see we're looking for kind of
[28:27] a something that makes a great
[28:32] uh big
[28:34] hoopla what the word would be there far
[28:38] well we coming back we just going to
[28:39] fight you know we're going to do this
[28:41] we're going to do that
[28:44] and I I I just don't see it that way I'm
[28:47] sorry I don't want to bust your
[28:51] bubble but that's just the way I believe
[28:54] it I preach here to my church what I
[28:56] believe amen
[28:59] amen see this is not for anybody else
[29:01] unless you want to listen to
[29:03] it but now
[29:08] listen brother randam goes into it and
[29:11] he
[29:12] says but when the seven
[29:17] Thunders and when the seven angels come
[29:20] forth to sound their trumpet there was
[29:23] one
[29:26] Thunder one Thunder but here is seven
[29:29] straight Thunders right in a row
[29:31] paragraph 249 of the seal
[29:35] book he said it's a relaxing time y
[29:39] right
[29:43] amen
[29:45] now when the seal
[29:49] broke they stood in all mhm now all is
[29:53] not a ra a relaxing time right that
[29:56] means you're te H you're standing at
[29:58] attention everything is
[30:00] perfectly and you brothers that was in
[30:02] the military you know you stood there at
[30:04] attention
[30:05] right amen and what was it you didn't
[30:08] dare lock your knees backward or
[30:10] something because you'd fall out in a
[30:11] little bit you know so everything was
[30:15] tension what about I while they said at
[30:18] ease will you just stand
[30:21] there no you tickle to death when they
[30:24] said at ease right cuz everything just
[30:26] slum
[30:28] you said it's a relaxing time
[30:34] yes see somebody one of these days going
[30:36] to see what it is amen and it's going to
[30:40] be a
[30:41] relaxing it's going to be a wonderful
[30:43] time that's right yep to
[30:47] rejoice and understand all about what's
[30:49] been going on here
[30:52] amen but he said it was he said it was
[30:55] the end of all things
[30:58] he said it was a
[31:00] scene he said it was the coming of the
[31:04] Lord and he says and those seven
[31:06] Thunders said they're all connected
[31:10] together
[31:14] now what I want to do for a little bit I
[31:16] want you to think about something let's
[31:18] just turn to Revelations
[31:22] 5 cuz I've heard this scripture
[31:25] explained over and over and over
[31:28] I'm sure you have
[31:35] too and I saw in the right hand of him
[31:37] that sat on the
[31:39] throne a book written within and on the
[31:43] backside seal with Seven
[31:48] Seals now heard that
[31:51] red but according to
[31:54] English sorry I don't have any
[31:57] you know that but I got a little
[32:01] sense this is where a lot of people read
[32:04] it and it's saw in the right hand to him
[32:05] that sat on the throne a book written
[32:07] within and on the backside seal with
[32:08] Seven
[32:12] Seals he well that's what it
[32:18] says why is that little comma after back
[32:21] slide the
[32:24] backside I thought a little compliment
[32:26] you just kind of slow down pause for a
[32:29] second it's not a period for you to
[32:33] stop it it it means just slow
[32:37] down
[32:39] right relax a little just slow
[32:43] down so now you read it to where it's
[32:45] written then and I saw in the right hand
[32:47] of him that sat on the throne a book
[32:49] written within and on the
[32:53] backside now you get sealed
[32:57] with Seven
[33:00] Seals you said what's the difference in
[33:03] that and read it the other
[33:04] way look what it's
[33:07] saying it says they're writing inside of
[33:09] this
[33:12] book and it's writing on the back side
[33:14] of this
[33:20] book but whatever is there inside
[33:23] outside upside down backwards
[33:25] whatever it winds up saying it's
[33:29] sealed with Seven
[33:34] Seals
[33:37] now brother in many occasions refers to
[33:40] this and he says see this writing in the
[33:43] book is writing the back side the
[33:48] book do you need those quotes I mean I'm
[33:51] be glad to find them for you but never
[33:53] did he say that there was anything on
[33:56] the outside the book they would add to
[33:58] what was in the book I want to quote
[34:01] that's right
[34:03] amen I I want that quote right that he
[34:07] ever made reference to an addition to
[34:11] the book that would be on the
[34:20] backside he says on
[34:24] the the first seal
[34:28] page 45 paragraph
[34:31] 45 he said if it was this kind of a book
[34:34] which means you know like we
[34:39] got he said it would be like seven
[34:42] straps on the outside right you
[34:47] know but he said it's not that kind of a
[34:51] book said it's a
[34:55] scroll
[34:58] and see being a scroll
[35:00] then you have many Scrolls you have many
[35:03] things to
[35:05] do but the way you know where you're at
[35:08] is there's a little
[35:10] tab sticking out a little something
[35:13] there that would say
[35:16] Isaiah then you roll it in
[35:19] Jeremiah
[35:21] Ezekiel more or less a statement of what
[35:25] book is is right so it's not adding to
[35:30] the book if Isaiah is written on the
[35:32] back
[35:34] side right if it's a scroll
[35:38] there well Isaiah sticking out it's not
[35:41] adding it's just an explanation of where
[35:43] the book what book it
[35:44] is amen because because you can't add to
[35:47] the book amen amen the Bible says if you
[35:50] add to this book you'll add the plagues
[35:52] of the book right but he said if you
[35:54] take away from this book you'll take
[35:55] your name out of the book
[35:57] that's scripture
[36:01] right you
[36:04] see we look at it is trying to figure
[36:07] out what is outside the
[36:09] book we'll get down in a minute where
[36:11] the Prophet said even the Thunders was
[36:14] not outside the
[36:16] book
[36:18] amen that's when I tried to get over
[36:20] Sunday there you can't add to the
[36:23] book
[36:25] right
[36:31] but when the book is
[36:35] revealed then you can
[36:37] see what the book really is
[36:43] about you can draw up your definition or
[36:47] think about
[36:50] it but why don't you listen a little
[36:54] bit and see if you're checking
[36:56] everything everything El you can't be
[36:58] listening I mean ain't nobody in here
[37:00] can do that I forgive me ain't nobody in
[37:02] here smart enough to figure out anything
[37:05] in the book and hear what the person
[37:08] say now you say you are I'm telling you
[37:11] you're a dummy cuz it can't be done
[37:13] that's as plain as I can make it I asked
[37:16] one time here I even said I said I wish
[37:18] you'd shut your books up your Bibles lay
[37:20] them on the seat and
[37:22] listen and a brother got some mad at me
[37:24] he come to me he said ain't nobody don't
[37:26] tell me I can't keep my book
[37:30] open well he was the one I was talking
[37:34] about I was simply trying to tell him
[37:37] listen because he was getting confused
[37:39] about what I was
[37:43] saying so read
[37:45] it so here we are in chapter
[37:51] 5 with a
[37:54] book that's closed
[37:57] right sealed up
[38:02] right
[38:04] right
[38:06] right then you turn over to chapter
[38:10] 6 and going into chapter
[38:13] 8 and you find that the lamb was
[38:16] breaking the seals right
[38:19] right right but I remember what we were
[38:22] trying to bring out
[38:25] Sunday your Prophet said it and I gave
[38:28] them Sunday if you want to go back on
[38:29] anybody on the Internet run it
[38:31] backwards I can take up in a minute I'll
[38:33] give
[38:34] it brother Ren says we're only presuming
[38:38] until that seventh seal breaks
[38:41] amen I don't understand that right ain't
[38:44] none of my business what you
[38:47] understand it's just plain language
[38:49] that's what he
[38:52] said he said you're only
[38:55] presuming until that seventh seal breaks
[38:58] you're going to find out when we get
[39:00] down to the end of this that the seventh
[39:02] seal was what was to be broken this
[39:04] day it was sealed by seven
[39:07] Thunders right CU that's where he said
[39:10] the seven the Thunders were that in the
[39:13] seven
[39:15] seal all right
[39:19] now chapter five the book is
[39:24] closed we gave it to before it's on
[39:27] Revelation chapter 5 book two I guess
[39:31] you call preach 1961 uh
[39:35] 618 he said this chapter 5 is not a
[39:39] verse by
[39:42] verse description of
[39:46] something it's preparing for something
[39:49] to happen
[39:52] right chapter 5 is preparing for
[39:55] something to happen
[39:57] right now you better remember this
[40:01] chapter 5 is not you in
[40:04] heaven until you get there you can think
[40:08] all you want you think well I thought I
[40:10] thought that's what you taught No
[40:13] Way chapter 5 is not a reality until we
[40:16] get
[40:17] there then it's a
[40:24] reality you said yeah but we're taking
[40:26] up chapter 4
[40:32] good but you better jump back down in
[40:34] chapter 10 somewhere cuz you going to
[40:35] need that seventh
[40:38] angel but think about what I'm
[40:43] saying all
[40:46] right
[40:50] because in chapter 5 the book is
[40:55] closed
[40:56] chapter one seal number one open I mean
[40:59] chapter 61 seal number one
[41:03] opens you go down a couple of verses
[41:05] seal number two opens seal number three
[41:07] opens seal number four five six even up
[41:10] to Revelations 81 where it
[41:12] says when the lamb broke the seal they
[41:15] were silence in heaven all
[41:18] right
[41:20] now you know that's in the book
[41:25] right MH now are you getting why it says
[41:28] in Revelations
[41:33] 5 come on are you
[41:36] listening Revelation 6 7 8 9 10
[41:45] what there's no way to know what that is
[41:47] until that angel tells
[41:54] us but all that's written in the
[41:57] book remember chapter 5 we
[42:00] read book written within
[42:04] right and on the back side
[42:07] right
[42:09] sealed with Seven
[42:12] Seals all right here's the statements
[42:14] everybody make but do you understand
[42:17] it Revelations 5 the book is closed
[42:20] Revelation 10 the book is
[42:25] open
[42:28] so now with that thought in
[42:32] mind let's go to chapter
[42:36] 10 remember what I said there's writing
[42:40] in the
[42:43] book you're not adding
[42:45] to when it says that that the seven
[42:48] Thunders sounded their voices that's
[42:50] written in the
[42:55] book
[42:57] we just don't know what it said it's
[43:00] written in the book you can't add to the
[43:03] book
[43:05] amen said no one shall be a be not not
[43:10] one word shall be added or taken from
[43:13] how can you take from and add to that
[43:16] then it shows you what Veil you got your
[43:20] veiled that's got you veiled
[43:22] away brother R says now that was quoting
[43:25] from the unveiling of God paragraph 238
[43:28] this is paragraph 2 218 216 and the
[43:32] world falling the falling apart of the
[43:34] world 621
[43:38] 12:16 he said his word it's
[43:44] Eternal it can't be added to or taken
[43:48] away
[43:50] right do you understand why he said
[43:53] that if it's not eternal it could be
[43:56] added to or taken
[43:58] away but if it's
[44:01] Eternal he can't add to all right that
[44:04] order to solve the
[44:07] problem now let's read Revelations
[44:14] 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[44:17] down from heaven CL over the cloud and a
[44:21] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[44:24] as it were the Sun and his feet is sters
[44:27] of fire now listen and he had in his
[44:29] hand a little book
[44:34] open all right everybody says Revelation
[44:37] 5 is closed Revelation 10 is
[44:41] open okay that's exactly
[44:45] right right but see you don't read the
[44:48] rest of the
[44:50] book verse
[44:54] three and he cried with with a loud
[44:56] voices when a lion roared and when he
[44:57] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[44:59] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[45:01] uttered their voices I was about to
[45:04] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[45:05] saying unto me seal up those things
[45:08] which the seven Thunders
[45:10] uttered and write them
[45:17] not
[45:19] now as I tried to explain
[45:22] Sunday according to my understanding or
[45:24] Roberts University has brother this
[45:28] message all right if they don't somebody
[45:30] else has it so what do you argue with me
[45:33] over who that I'm talking about still
[45:35] listening to what's being
[45:37] said a lot of people's got R around his
[45:39] message
[45:41] right amen and they can read it right
[45:46] and they can take the first seal and
[45:47] make you a wonderful speech about that
[45:51] it is not the White Horse riter is not
[45:54] the Holy Ghost
[45:57] it's the
[46:00] Antichrist because they've got what
[46:02] brother around
[46:07] said okay right so the book is
[46:16] open Revelation 102 said it's
[46:23] open well what's the problem if it's
[46:25] open
[46:29] there wouldn't be any problem if he
[46:31] didn't have three and four down below
[46:34] there you have an open
[46:39] book but when you go down to the fourth
[46:41] verse and it says seal up those things
[46:44] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[46:45] write them
[46:51] not so is
[46:54] the Bible
[46:57] sealed with Seven
[47:01] Seals
[47:03] once the prophet has told us what they
[47:10] are are you
[47:14] listening once he told you what that
[47:17] is is it
[47:24] sealed
[47:27] I'm asking you that
[47:32] question see it's an open
[47:38] book give anybody a see book and let
[47:42] them read
[47:43] it right it don't matter where the
[47:46] Methodist mad Presbyterian or Catholics
[47:48] or
[47:50] whatever we was up at Jeffersonville
[47:52] years
[47:54] ago brother Billy Paul come out here and
[47:57] told us he said he' just gotten a letter
[47:59] from the World Council of churches I
[48:02] think it was or the Catholic Church one
[48:03] of the two now I may missed it that's a
[48:05] long time
[48:06] ago but they ordered or requested a
[48:10] church age
[48:13] book this is probably about 68 69
[48:16] somewhere in
[48:17] there why would they request a book When
[48:22] anybody could just walk up and give them
[48:24] one
[48:28] see I walk up to you and I give you a
[48:29] book I give you a book you can't use
[48:32] that in the
[48:35] court you can't use that in ACC cour to
[48:37] law cuz anybody can write a
[48:40] book but when you
[48:44] request that I send you a certain book
[48:49] it can be used in
[48:51] court you better think about
[48:53] it the church AE book is is drastically
[48:56] against organized religion and Catholic
[48:57] church and things right
[49:01] amen but you see church are you
[49:07] listening the book is open in chapter
[49:14] 10 but why would it turn right back
[49:16] around and say the seven
[49:20] Thunders when they uttered their voices
[49:22] he was told not to R
[49:24] it
[49:31] let me just read a couple of things
[49:32] brother around says about
[49:37] this God in Simplicity paragraph
[49:43] 380 talking about the breaking of the
[49:45] seals one will take place if the angel
[49:48] of the Lord will break them seals for
[49:51] us remember it's seal with them seven
[49:55] mysterious
[50:02] Thunders now you got 14
[50:06] seals come
[50:10] on girl you got the book seal with Seven
[50:16] Seals but yet you don't know what those
[50:18] things are until the thunder sound to
[50:20] you
[50:23] right even though you can read verbatim
[50:26] off the
[50:27] page you can read the Bible verbatim and
[50:31] we taught of Trinity
[50:33] right right but that's scripture for
[50:39] it but he said it seal with them seven
[50:43] Thunders paragraph
[50:45] 29 of the breach between the church a
[50:48] and the
[50:49] seals this seven seal book is revealed
[50:53] at the time of the seven
[50:56] thunders of Revelations
[51:06] 10 I hope you're following me you can
[51:09] read the church the seal book over and
[51:11] over and over and don't know what in the
[51:12] world it's saying yeah you know what's
[51:14] said on each line each page each word
[51:17] yes
[51:18] amen what about a revelation that's
[51:24] right
[51:26] paragraph 103 of God hidden in
[51:31] Simplicity you talking about being
[51:33] inspired and and I believe that the
[51:35] seven
[51:36] angels who holds those seven
[51:39] Thunders will
[51:54] grant 78 questions and answers book 4 64
[51:58] 8:30 evening service question
[52:02] 395 have the seven
[52:05] Thunders which equal seven Mysteries
[52:08] already been
[52:10] revealed were they revealed in the Seven
[52:12] Seals but are yet but are yet not known
[52:16] to us as the seven Thunders
[52:18] yet he says
[52:21] no they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[52:26] that's what the Thunders was
[52:31] about there was to reveal the seven
[52:33] Thunders that heard of voices and no one
[52:35] can make out what it was John knew what
[52:37] it was but he was forbidden to write it
[52:40] but he said the seventh angel in the day
[52:42] of his sounding the seven Mysteries of
[52:45] the seven
[52:47] Thunders would be revealed
[52:52] amen huh so we had right to
[52:58] say this is my revelation of it
[53:04] amen this is my Revelation
[53:08] right all
[53:11] right you remember the other day when I
[53:13] was trying to bring out a little bit on
[53:14] it there in the
[53:22] scriptures Jesus said glorify me with
[53:24] the glory thy heav the before the word
[53:25] begun and God sounded back and said I
[53:28] have glorified you and will glorify you
[53:30] again and they that stood by heard it
[53:32] thunder right but Jesus knew what was
[53:38] saying right right Mount Si brother
[53:43] around and said God
[53:48] thundered but the people heard bloom
[53:50] bloom bloom bloom
[53:51] bloom but Moses Heard a Voice
[53:56] mhm brother Ram what are those Thunders
[53:59] he said the Thunder is the voice of
[54:06] God he said have you heard the Thunders
[54:09] The Voice have you heard the voice of
[54:11] God through the opening of these
[54:16] seals what are you trying to
[54:21] explain the book is sealed in chapter 5
[54:26] but
[54:26] it's excuse me but it's open in chapter
[54:33] 10 we know how it came open the lamb
[54:35] opened the seals right
[54:39] right but then immediately it sealed
[54:41] right back up
[54:44] right because the seven Thunders uted
[54:47] their
[54:52] voices I'll be glad to find these for
[54:54] you
[54:56] and my angels didn't tell John didn't
[54:58] tell brother random anything out there
[54:59] in Arizona other than come back to
[55:01] Jefferson bille now that's what he
[55:04] said go back to Jeffersonville be told
[55:06] you what to do you better be careful
[55:08] because you make him a liar if you think
[55:10] he knows everything when he came back
[55:12] because when he got back he said I don't
[55:14] know what that first seal
[55:16] is that's then when the first seal was
[55:19] broke he said I don't know what the
[55:20] second one is right now I'd rather had
[55:23] his idea than mine or yours you right
[55:26] but he said he didn't know he said I'd
[55:28] have made a horrible mistake on that
[55:30] first seal if he had to come in the room
[55:32] to straighten me
[55:37] out he said it's been the a has not been
[55:40] a man said it's been I'm talk quoting
[55:41] out of seable it's been the angels of
[55:44] the Lord bringing me back for this
[55:46] message tonight he
[55:48] said that's on the seventh
[55:54] seal see why he would say you're only
[55:56] presuming until the seventh seal
[55:59] breaks but yet he knew all week long
[56:02] something was going on he asked the
[56:03] question or made the statement he said I
[56:06] wondered if somebody catch
[56:08] it and see what was going
[56:12] on that's what we're going to do on the
[56:14] next message the Lord willing is take
[56:15] the things brother brandham said that
[56:18] seventh seal was to
[56:23] him amen CU he said this is my
[56:28] Revelation see thunder is a voice of God
[56:32] when no seals broke to the prophet he
[56:34] had heard the voice of God
[56:38] y amen amen God had spoke to him and
[56:41] told him what it was right he said an
[56:43] angel come daily in the room right
[56:50] y he says the Holy Spirit was in the
[56:53] room to reveal those things
[56:59] what is the Angel of the
[57:01] Lord what is an angel come in yeah and
[57:04] then everybody went in the seventh angel
[57:07] was brother randam theop
[57:11] yeah and that's who he
[57:15] saw well you got a problem back there
[57:18] with Paul might stand a pretty good
[57:20] thought but when you get over about
[57:23] Luther Wesley you you're running very
[57:26] close to saying that there was a
[57:28] theophany there to tell them what that
[57:30] Feld 6 and 7 C
[57:33] was when Luther himself said that the
[57:37] Jews was Antichrist nor been took out
[57:39] and
[57:44] killed I wouldn't want his the offy
[57:46] coming to
[57:50] me but you understand what I'm getting
[57:53] at
[57:56] just a point I want you to get because
[57:58] this is a basics for foundation for
[57:59] another couple of
[58:01] messages so in Revelations 5 the book is
[58:05] is
[58:08] closed but we read that it's open and
[58:11] how it's opened by the
[58:12] lamb and I read to you the other day
[58:15] where that John was to send back to the
[58:18] church right but he said he brought it
[58:22] and signified it to John he said in John
[58:24] remember the quote handed it down
[58:30] right to the seventh
[58:34] angel you know it's over in the 10th
[58:36] chapter where John later is
[58:40] told you go take the
[58:43] book you got your 10 chapter look
[58:47] at the voice which I heard from Heaven
[58:50] spake unto me saying go and take the
[58:52] little book which is open in the hand of
[58:54] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[58:57] and upon the Earth
[58:59] yes and I went unto the angel and said
[59:01] unto him give me the little book and he
[59:04] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[59:08] it shall come it shall make thy belly
[59:10] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[59:12] sweet as honey yes and I took a little
[59:15] book out of the hand of the Angel's
[59:18] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[59:21] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[59:23] had eaten it my daily was
[59:26] bitter you know what brother R said
[59:28] about
[59:29] it he said the word is sweet sometimes
[59:32] when you hear
[59:34] it he said but it's better when you got
[59:36] to live
[59:38] it okay and he said unto me thou must
[59:43] prophesy again before many peoples and
[59:45] Nations and tongues and Kings so John is
[59:48] told he's coming back to the
[59:53] Earth he's at to
[59:57] book have we ate the
[1:00:03] book come on right have we ate the
[1:00:08] book if John was the type of the Rapture
[1:00:11] I thought he would be a type of all the
[1:00:13] things you know would be related to you
[1:00:16] and I
[1:00:20] amen so if John was to eat the
[1:00:23] book
[1:00:26] what about you and I
[1:00:30] right is this word that we have more
[1:00:34] valuable than life
[1:00:37] itself right that's right or are we
[1:00:41] concerned about what somebody else says
[1:00:44] I like to read what people have to
[1:00:47] say but it never enters my Cranium cap
[1:00:50] as you call it my head as to think that
[1:00:55] they are they're
[1:00:57] right they might be partially right
[1:01:01] right they might have a little
[1:01:05] truth but you remember about a year ago
[1:01:08] I tried to Pi the message on it I want
[1:01:10] the truth not a truth but the
[1:01:18] truth we can read the book anybody can
[1:01:22] read this Bible that's right Y and if
[1:01:25] you read this Bible under the
[1:01:28] explanation now are you listening if you
[1:01:31] read this Bible under the explanation of
[1:01:34] the Prophet you would never see a
[1:01:36] Trinity
[1:01:38] right and you could be able to explain
[1:01:41] one God that's
[1:01:44] right Father Son and Holy Ghost that's
[1:01:46] like I'm a father I'm a son I'm a
[1:01:53] human but has it been
[1:01:57] revealed
[1:01:59] right in other words have you ate the
[1:02:02] book where it can be
[1:02:08] revealed or you ate a bunch of other
[1:02:10] stuff got a belly a and don't want the
[1:02:14] book
[1:02:17] right well you just think you're the
[1:02:20] only one that knows
[1:02:21] anything that's funny I've never said
[1:02:23] that
[1:02:26] right and you know what people accuse
[1:02:28] you of being what they
[1:02:30] are ever noticed
[1:02:34] that that's a quote from Brother Woody
[1:02:37] way back years ago that people accuse
[1:02:39] you of being what they
[1:02:44] are you ever seen two people fussing
[1:02:46] fighting both of them fuss and fighting
[1:02:47] over about the same
[1:02:49] thing both of them talking about the
[1:02:51] same
[1:02:53] thing
[1:02:57] one accusing the other one to be in this
[1:02:59] accusing the other be in
[1:03:04] that but it's the book
[1:03:10] open if if you understand what I'm
[1:03:12] saying Church come
[1:03:14] on this book is opened that's
[1:03:19] right sir the Prophet come and go told
[1:03:22] us what these things mean
[1:03:25] that's why I have written in my
[1:03:27] Bible what it means right because I
[1:03:31] don't have that good a memory anymore
[1:03:34] and I'm glad years ago I wrote it
[1:03:37] down the prophet say something I said
[1:03:39] what does that mean okay hey we got that
[1:03:44] man I can tell you what the prophet
[1:03:48] said but I can do every bit of that if
[1:03:51] you're listening to what I'm saying and
[1:03:52] not have one Dil of Revelation that's
[1:03:54] right and have not heard the voice of
[1:04:00] God cuz the Thunder is the voice of
[1:04:07] God the Thunder is the voice of
[1:04:10] God but see if he thundered at Mount Si
[1:04:12] and Moses knew what he
[1:04:16] said but yet Moses wrote down that it
[1:04:20] thundered he never wrote down what he
[1:04:22] said right you know he may how do you
[1:04:24] understand what I'm just driving the
[1:04:25] point
[1:04:30] mhm the world when Jesus was standing
[1:04:33] there heard a thunder but he heard a
[1:04:35] voice and evidently Every Which the
[1:04:38] writer Mark Matthew Mark Luke John one
[1:04:41] of which two of them wasn't there so you
[1:04:43] have to take that out Mark and Luke so
[1:04:47] evident of John
[1:04:48] are some of them you know must have
[1:04:51] remembered what was said right
[1:04:55] and they wrote it
[1:04:58] down they heard what was
[1:05:01] said but everybody else heard a
[1:05:05] thunder have you heard the voice of God
[1:05:08] brother around would say speaking to
[1:05:11] you from the opening of these
[1:05:14] seals
[1:05:17] sir come on that that that's the only
[1:05:19] thing that I want to know anything about
[1:05:22] not how long you've been in the message
[1:05:24] much your seniority is that's right
[1:05:28] know
[1:05:32] right yeah I want to know the truth
[1:05:35] that's
[1:05:36] right I don't want to be like that
[1:05:38] brother one time said I shouted over the
[1:05:40] Trinity and I shout now well I wouldn't
[1:05:43] have made that statement for nothing in
[1:05:44] the
[1:05:46] world because he was saying I just shout
[1:05:50] it he had no reference to anything that
[1:05:52] would be of any value
[1:05:54] he just shouted over the Trinity he
[1:05:57] shouted over the truth
[1:06:00] right but you see we think those things
[1:06:02] are beautiful
[1:06:07] things but has the Thunder the voice of
[1:06:10] God sounded to
[1:06:12] you through the opening of God's word no
[1:06:17] no no brother that I'm never heard of
[1:06:20] Thunder
[1:06:23] well
[1:06:24] if the prophet's
[1:06:27] right you notice I'm saying that out
[1:06:30] that way not me right if the prophet is
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:35] then he was the mouthpiece of
[1:06:39] God so whatever he said is what's right
[1:06:43] right yes sir not what we think he said
[1:06:47] right but what he said that's
[1:06:50] right
[1:06:53] y
[1:06:54] but you see we spend our time trying to
[1:06:56] explain something and I know I've done
[1:06:58] that over and over right but I've tried
[1:07:01] my best to explain it where you can
[1:07:02] understand
[1:07:04] it if the Thunder is the voice of God
[1:07:07] have you heard the voice of God through
[1:07:08] the opening of the
[1:07:11] word
[1:07:13] right because you cannot claim then the
[1:07:17] where it says the Lord himself to
[1:07:18] descend from heaven and a
[1:07:22] shout so you can't BL that if you
[1:07:24] haven't heard the message right that
[1:07:27] sensible you know somebody come in
[1:07:30] somebody walk right off the street come
[1:07:31] in I want to be
[1:07:33] saved you telling the Lord to sended
[1:07:36] with a
[1:07:38] shout where did he
[1:07:41] go where's he at right cuz they don't
[1:07:44] know what you're talking about
[1:07:46] right but when it's made
[1:07:49] known then you can see we don't need
[1:07:51] another messenger that's right we need
[1:07:54] this message
[1:07:56] revealed I'm going to say this and I'll
[1:07:58] come back to it in a couple weeks maybe
[1:08:00] next Wednesday
[1:08:03] whatever so if the coming of the
[1:08:07] Lord is what the prophet said it
[1:08:12] was he said it was the revealing of the
[1:08:15] word that's right that's
[1:08:22] it so anything if he's come to you and I
[1:08:25] the words got to be revealed that's
[1:08:27] right cuz that's the only way he can
[1:08:28] come we're not talking about his first
[1:08:30] coming that brought
[1:08:34] salvation healings and
[1:08:37] things we're talking about his second
[1:08:42] coming and remember what I brought out
[1:08:47] Sunday why the S seal is silence minute
[1:08:50] hour of his coming
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:56] you can't tell the world about it that's
[1:08:58] right that's right there's no way to
[1:09:00] tell them that's right because it's his
[1:09:04] coming that's right amen and his coming
[1:09:08] is when he revealed the word to you not
[1:09:10] to
[1:09:11] me
[1:09:13] right revealing it to me is f where I
[1:09:16] can break it down and talk to you about
[1:09:17] it but he's got to reveal hisself to you
[1:09:20] you wasn't saved because you come to
[1:09:22] Lula amen right amen you're saved by
[1:09:27] grace through faith through your
[1:09:28] dependence upon the blood of Jesus
[1:09:30] Christ oh yeah
[1:09:32] right well then the change of the body
[1:09:34] could only be one thing the coming of
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:39] Lord and wasn't that what the prophet
[1:09:42] said he comes back after
[1:09:46] us I met a quote her the other day you
[1:09:49] might to hang on to it you come back
[1:09:50] after us right that's what the S seal
[1:09:53] doing is com back after you it's not
[1:09:55] coming to reveal you a Redemptive form
[1:09:58] it's coming to claim his possession
[1:10:01] that's
[1:10:03] right think on these
[1:10:06] things there's a lot of things under the
[1:10:08] seventh seal that the prophet has told
[1:10:15] us now we get into next we get into the
[1:10:17] things that the prophet told him that
[1:10:19] was related to
[1:10:21] him and then let's see if we can find it
[1:10:24] related to me and you that's it right
[1:10:27] cuz if we don't find it related to you
[1:10:28] and I it's not going to work it's not
[1:10:29] going to change us
[1:10:34] right what do you think about
[1:10:39] it that a person could tell you what the
[1:10:42] seventh seal
[1:10:45] is you know the prophet tell you what it
[1:10:47] is
[1:10:50] amen he said this is my revelation of it
[1:10:54] right yet he made it so simple he was
[1:10:57] talking about the things that was taking
[1:11:00] place in his own life that's right I
[1:11:03] wish you would go to the seal seven seal
[1:11:05] and listen to
[1:11:09] it you'll understand why in the
[1:11:12] beginning when I first read
[1:11:15] it that I quit reading it went back to
[1:11:18] the church age
[1:11:20] book because I saw him talking too much
[1:11:23] about his
[1:11:24] right that's the way I thought
[1:11:31] it but then one day I seen he was
[1:11:34] talking about you and me that's
[1:11:37] right then I could go back and read the
[1:11:41] book and listen to what he had to
[1:11:45] say and find out his coming has been
[1:11:48] coming since the day of
[1:11:52] Pentecost we we are the end of his
[1:11:56] coming is that the seventh seal the end
[1:11:58] of all things we're ending it
[1:12:00] there right but when he comes here is
[1:12:04] that the end of everything no the world
[1:12:06] knows nothing about it time will go
[1:12:08] right on it won't end the world it won't
[1:12:11] end anything for him to come and get you
[1:12:13] and me tonight they'll just keep right
[1:12:15] on going that's right but see it be the
[1:12:17] end for you and
[1:12:21] I cuz the end of any thing is a new
[1:12:25] beginning amen you're not talking about
[1:12:28] natural things falling off a
[1:12:31] cliff you're talking about the revealing
[1:12:33] of his word that's right one more
[1:12:36] statement that's why I believe in
[1:12:38] forming latter rign see because what we
[1:12:41] have
[1:12:43] today and God even reveal it to us
[1:12:47] tomorrow will be a former reain that's
[1:12:50] right because there's a new word every
[1:12:52] day amen yeah right opening of the word
[1:12:55] every day than you
[1:12:58] Lord so what I stand with tonight is
[1:13:01] wonderful but tomorrow I must keep
[1:13:05] searching
[1:13:06] praying and saying Lord reveal this to
[1:13:11] me let me go out as the children of
[1:13:13] Israel did and get me another fresh part
[1:13:15] of
[1:13:18] Mana but just don't put me in a place
[1:13:21] where I'm going to try to hold it over
[1:13:22] you remember
[1:13:26] rotten what do you think about it the
[1:13:29] book is
[1:13:31] open the prophet said it sealed those
[1:13:34] seven Thunders until we know what those
[1:13:36] Thunders are we're only
[1:13:42] presuming yet we can read off the pages
[1:13:45] what it is amen but I still don't make
[1:13:48] it was
[1:13:49] real have you ever asked God for a
[1:13:52] revelation amen yes I mean just ask him
[1:13:55] to reveal something yes sir I don't
[1:13:58] understand what brother Dale talking
[1:13:59] about I can't figure him out well ask
[1:14:01] God to reveal it
[1:14:05] right and then when he reveals there
[1:14:07] won't be no problem could it be your
