in line Lord Jesus that's our desire is to get in line with the work Lord as as the prophet was was speaking of in in the uniting time and Sun talking about the bride is uniting with the word and what is she getting ready for she's getting ready for the ranch Lord Jesus we see we don't have much time left and we just pray that you'll just help us Lord just ministered each one in a special way come and anoint my lips to speak and ears to hear Lord we give you all the thanks the owner in glory and we believe it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 says and our Brethren could not speak unto you as in the spiritual but as in the carnal even as in under babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you are not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for you are yet carnal the way out whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men for while one saith I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man amen I have planted Apollos water but God gave me increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but God that giveth the increase now he that watereth and he that he that planteth and he that Waters our one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for you for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry he or God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another bill of there upon thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth they're upon right amen made heavy seats Lord I blessing to the reading of the word and uh just trying to figure out exactly how to just how the Lord would leave it uh I just want to speak on uh they're from verse 9 says laborers together with God Amen and uh just been doing some been reading and uh if you if you you know you read the brother Brown said that uh you know Corinthians was the book of Corrections right if you've done any reading in the in the book of Corinthians uh you know they were an interesting bunch of people I don't know I was I was thinking I was reading some things and reading some commentaries and different things and you know Paul must not have never had a with the grant we always had they always have some kind of issue going on and there's all you know because uh there was all they was all messed up with with something all the time and he was all the time trying to straighten them out and you know and you know the Ephesians was was the group that was able that he was able to bring a lot of a lot of things out of the scripture and teach them and uh show them a lot of great things but the Corinthians he was all the time trying to make straighten him out because they were all confused and uh in many different times even in this chapter three you'll find out you go back to the first two chapters of the book he goes back to this same thing and he's uh he's rebuking the Corinthians in the first two chapters for the same thing because he's speaking of them having uh divisions among them and uh but you know you look at these things and you say boy that was a that was a tough crowd that uh the Apostle Paul had to deal with but you know what struck me was God allowed that to happen that you and I would have this work right right because you know what we were in the same place because we were confused too and you know because it came to us right because we were in confusion too because if it hadn't been written in the scripture and we you look at this group though well they're all confused well we were all confused also and you know because you look at it today and there's still a lot of people confused we're still we're still trying to get over all all the confusion because that's the way the devil works is he works through your confusion because he wants you to be confused right and but we we see here that hey speaking of of being carnal and speaking of them being babes and just a few things you know uh the Apostle Paul covers different things in this chapter one he talks about them being uh babes and having needing right uh not having been able to take the Strong Leaf but still being on milk yeah and they said are you are you carnal you know are you still carnal after all these things and you see there's a few things he talks about and the other one he talks about was that the bride and the body is supposed to be working together in harmony and he you know he sees that you see all these divisions and and then he goes back on and later on you see where he gets into it and he starts talking about a foundation because he said he has a wise master builder he had laid a foundation and then when he gets on later into the temp the chapter after he speaks on laying a foundation he goes and starts speaking on he says ye are the temple of God so he goes on because he after and we'll try to get into some of these things but I want to speak on just see how the Lord leads it but certain things in this chapter that really stand on me and the first one is when he's speaking he said because he said you're you're still on the meal right because he you know he comes back even in first in chapter one and you know he comes out and because he's speaking in chapter one listen he says in chapter one he says I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given to you by Jesus Christ said everything ye are enriched by him this is chapter one verse four that in everything you are enriched by Him in all utterance and all and and all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that ye come behind or lack right and no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ so he's speaking of what what they have in front of them because he said that he's giving you these gifts that that you may not like but he's but he said he said but you're still carnal he said you've been given this great gift but you're still carnal and it's even when he comes into chapter two he's even still speaking of them talking about them being in a carnal in a carnal condition and you know he talks about in one part where he said he was glad that he didn't baptize by just a few of them because you know he said if you because people would think that he baptized in his own name right and he said he was glad that he didn't have any baptism with any of them because he didn't want to have anything because they were so confused and so he's speaking here and uh you know he's he's speaking of that that a spiritual man because they were supposed to be spiritual people but those that were supposed to be coming off the milk because even in Hebrews 5 Paul writing is speaking of he said those that are unskillful in the word of righteousness because they're still on the mill because they've not come to the place where they can discern right I said you know that was the thing that was that was Eve's Eve's problem because Satan told Dave in the beginning he said you'll know good and evil Robin was she couldn't discern between good and evil and so that's what it is it takes the word because the scripture says it you know there's a way that is right that a man think it's right but that way is death so a lot of people can think but it takes discernment to know what's right and what's wrong because if without discernment you never get anywhere right because if without discernment and you can't figure things out for yourself because that's what has happened around the message with a lot of people is they've tried to figure things out for themselves and you see that because it comes to not just as gamelia told them told them about calling the Christians you know he said leave it alone he said leave it on because he said if it's of God it'll come to pass because God will use it he said if not it'll come to naught right and we see that what has happened to a lot of people is it's come to know right because people and people have put their faith in in something for so long they wandered in this thing for so long and it's become the dogs they've come to nothing they've done what would it cost because now is the time of matter you know because you walk around for so long but now is the time it has to be manifested right because you know I have and you know I just use myself because that's only measuring stick I have right it's me right because I look you know why why is that what that I that I've walked in the the same way for so many years but you know what I see though I I'm overcoming because you know that's why because it doesn't want the devil tells you it's it's not what comes before you it's not their sense I am an overcomer I know that I'm going to overcome these things why because I know why did God bring me to this place amen right right because he has a perfect word because he began a good work and he's going to finish it right right now the problem is is Aaron Roberts gets in the way oh yeah that's right and I got a lot to get in the way amen well I'm going to arrested just like brother DLC take more Rapture and thank me for me then arrested but that's but see God has began a good work but the thing is is we've still got to hold on and we've got to yield ourselves because we we're the ones that are trying to work things out and if we and we see it comes to not right but if we come to this place that we can see Who We Are that's it that's right amen so we're coming we've got to get off the milk come on brother man and good milk is good milk's wonderful I haven't had supper tonight I had a glass of milk and it was good sure and I'm ready to go get something to eat when this is I'm ready to go get something to eat yeah that's right because I can't live on just milk come on I like cereal or a little milk bless you yeah he said they're strong meat all right there's there is greater understanding amen's right but he said he said you're not able to Bear it he said you've not been able to Bear it right right he said it's been before you and then see he's speaking to him I'm trying to get to you to a place that you can see there's more in front of you because you've got to grow amen you've got to grow it's time to grow right and if we can't stay in we can't stay in the same place forever that's right because we've got to come because if we don't come to the place and I understand that everybody's not going to come to the come to the place of a body change but you know what there's some people that are right right that's right and some people are not going and because some people are not going to come to that place because they're going to stand in their own way right all mine that's right that's right brother amen because there's going to be because it's not it's not that that is a lack from God it's a lack from them right yeah exactly right because you know brother Brandon was saying you know that's that's what caused it I have to you know I have this quote here you know brother around talking about uh our misbehavior in Ephesians parallels Joshua you know it's an amazing you think about it he said he said your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers he said can cause this church to bitterly fail amen all right bro can you imagine that that's one person right right can you can you you think about aching right because of his own greed right because of his own selfish desire he had blood on his hands right right yeah amen because of his own selfish desire and he thought well this won't mess it's just a little bit I wonder what it what it stood what it was like for his family to stand out there for every one of them to be killed right yeah it wasn't just it just wasn't aching that died it was his whole family they destroyed everything that's right amen that's right you think you think about that he said he said it's our misbehavior of unconfessed sins right amen that a church can barely fail yeah Brett Brown said brother Ram said that one person that we can stand in each other's way right amen that we can be the one to stand in somebody's way of getting of them being healed yeah all right I I think about uh I was reading uh I believe the message is led by the spirit and your brother Brandon was speaking of the woman that uh had committed adultery while her husband was gone and you know she almost got hit by the train and and she was you know she was in such a nervous wreck she was you know all tore up and you know brother random but somebody all the times that you know she'd been in all these different meetings and they poured all over oh yeah and they prayed and prayed and prayed but you know brother Brown said that Satan has a legal right if to stay right there right as long as they're unconfessed sin right he said you can pour all on them by the gallons and pray all you want he said Satan still has a legal right to say right there amen and your brother Brown said he said you know he said I was not going to pray for that thing to come off because he might have got in trouble yeah he said I said I'm not gonna pray he said because I want to find out he said because she didn't know all these other ministers right and she'd been to all these churches and everything that had had been prayed over and she never got any better she just kept getting worse and worse and worse until she came before brother and then he saw in deserve it what her problem was right see that was the thing because the word is a discernment right all right and so that's the thing is you you stay right along that you'll find out because he's going to discern what your problem is that's right and you know the thing is is you can stay right there and you can turn it down or you can accept it right exactly because you have to because it'll come out and you'll find out but you'll you'll burn your conscience you see your conscience from that yep amen and people have done that amen but you know you come to that face and you know just because he'll just you know he'll show you the things that are wrong in your life what what you need to take care of right the thing is but you hold on to that because you know I've seen things in my life and say why can't I get rid of that you keep going through that battle but there's a time appointed unto you for you to get victory over there because if he's going to bring that out he's going to show you what you need to overcome and guess what there's a time of Victory time you have to come to that place because he's obligated to amen right because I can't do it in myself but if I give it to him he's obligated to override for me to overcome that yeah yeah amen so we have to come to this place that we can overcome right so going on here Paul speaking as he's speaking of them being carnal in them uh having these divisions walking being carnal and he says who is uh Paul who is Apollos right because he says one one says I'm apologize and he says who are they who is Paul right who is Apollos what's it was you saved by Paul was you saved by Apollos all right he said no he said because what he said I planted Apollos water but he said God was the one that gave the increase right he said because see we're all working having to work together amen because LeBron is is having is to work together because you know as Paul was speaking he says if uh you know the whole body can't be hearing or the whole body can't be smelly right because each one of them has has their own heart hey but he says but who is this one and because he said we are laborers together right right we are to labor together so if if God has a plan and a purpose to take place then each one of us have to work together because just asked one can hinder just as you can stand in somebody's way you're the very one that may be the one to have someone through right right as I believe it was uh you know the lady the Brethren was telling the story about the the lady that uh had the had the I think she rented a barn or something and had a meeting and there was only one person the preacher came in and preached and only one person got saved and it was D.L Moody right and you know everybody say about well you know that was that was a a pitiful meeting that they had she spent all this money for a meeting right but you know what now from that one man right right you you look at what took place all around the world what an evangelist DL Moody was in though in the work that he done and some people say well that was just you know you look at that and they said well I didn't pay much dividends but you know what you can't you can't measure the dividends that came from that meeting internally right well because of what he was able to do and so sometimes we look at things and we say well I don't it don't it don't matter much it matters more than you than you can imagine see if we could see it as brother Adam was speaking of in the church he said you know you see the angels are in in the building they're sitting on the pews and everything you know what it's sometimes we just Overlook those things or sometimes we don't ever consciously comprehend those things right when we come to church that that we're sitting in the midst of of an eternal God you know as as brother Dan was preaching on the Shekinah you know he said you know when the word came in and everything came into its place then the Shekinah Glory he came down into the into the temple you know we don't realize but the Shekinah Glory you know what we we don't comprehend but that same Shekinah that came down in that Temple is in you and I because he came into each one of us right so guess what when when he came down and you know he was saying he couldn't Minister because he was in the midst and it was so great do you know you carry that same one with you and you came in tonight each one of us having our own link of Fire have come down and the Shekinah Glory is here right all right amen but we just look and say well that's just this you know it's just brother Aaron and brother waiting Brother Anderson we're just you know it's just us you know same ones we sell them and we missed yeah all right who's here right that's right six sometimes when we see sometimes but we don't see what it what is taking place we said when I stress brother down he's just gonna get up and you know we're just gonna sing the same two songs and he's gonna get up he's gonna pass out quotes and we're just going to read the underlying stuff yeah yeah page will make a few comments and then we'll go home and sometimes we fail to see what's what when he were under lines things in the quotes you know sometimes you have to go back and read the whole thing because if you raped the whole cup the whole quote the things that he has underlined just steps off the page yeah because you actually miss what's really the real emphasis of things what is being said if you're not reading the whole quote right amen but I mean he's just trying because you know he don't have time to read everything I mean so I mean he you know we all I think everybody has been to school long enough to read so I mean we can do that on our own all right but I mean if you've seen the things it is that brother Dale's giving us he's ordained of God to lead us through and he's I mean right he can't do much more than he does all right come on Amen right the only other way would be supernaturally just open her heads and pour it in sometimes wait wish let's see as brother Dale's been original so you've got to come to that understanding right that's right because you have to have your understanding open because you know you you look at brother brother Branham you know and I was reading some of the um I can't remember what message I was reading but anyway you know Sister me well you know he got up and the angel Lord was in the room and you know he's he's uh dealing with different things that he's gonna have to go do and you know Sister Matey's trying to talk to him and you know he's in this other realm and she's trying to talk to him about you know do you need you want some breakfast or whatever an angel Lords and she said what I knew he was in the room because she could you know I could feel his presence and you know he's in this other realm and he's thinking about all these things and the Lord's showing him things and she's trying to talk about feeding the kids and doing laundry and all these other things and here's here's the angel Lord trying to talk to brother Brown because he's going out to do things and sometimes we miss those things because right you know we said well that was just the prophet come on bro no he's come to do the same thing for you miss that brother Brown said that he said a child of God can come to such a place come on brother you can live in such a realm that the devil don't even know what to do with it but we think what else for brother Brown that's for Brother David yeah no that's for the very weakest Christian and that's right amen because that is the children's bread that is that is a that is a right that is a because you're an heir so that belongs to every heir of God Amen that's right that you can come to that place they did you know you see how things go yeah you're not going to live in a bed of roses it's not going to be great all the time but you know what there's an overcoming because you can walk it around see Jesus you read Jesus walking around with perfect Faith right right it was it didn't say you lived in a realm of perfect life that's right there's no such thing as a perfect life in this world exactly because brother Randall was speaking of uh and questions and answers you know he says as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you man that's right because you've been raised up to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so when you come to that place you know what you're still going to battle this old flesh why because you're still in this realm and he's and Satan's still got a Punch coming at you but you know what you've got to come to the place that you're that you've come to the place where you're recognizing that you're leaving and walking in Heavenly places and not living in the realm of the world right because you know sometimes you get out on a on a job and everybody says well you know they call you and they tell you my air conditioner is doing this my air conditioner is doing that it'll do this it won't do that and you know how you know how it is you come out there and work on it man runs perfect homes perfect okay fine nothing wrong well I know it's messed up so you go out there and start praying Lord what's wrong with this thing yeah sure and I and it's just sometimes it's just like being magnetized and you can be drawn right in yeah and find things that you don't see yeah sure it's just like but they ain't talking about working on cars we say what is that ask the Lord being mindful outside so we think we think that well that's just simple things I think golf is a simple thing amen that's what I look for when I can see when I can go out there and pray and say Lord you know help me with this and help me with that and I know it was him right it takes care of these things because I because you can't find things but he can pull them out to you all right he can show you what's wrong amen he can give you the minutes right that's right so yes that's so simple but see that's where that's where we miss it because we think well we're not it's not it's not something great it's not something big yeah so that's the reason that we don't see the big things because we miss God in the little girl right that's right amen because if you come to a place where you can see God in the little things come on you start walking he'll start showing things right then he can draw you into big things that's right he can show you greater things but if you're not faithful in the little things he said the foxes the little foxes for the vines hey said so if you're not seeing him moving the little things see he said everybody Praises God for the future what he's going to do then what he's done in the past but they miss him right now right how is he working in the midst he's working in the little things right the things that you that you missed that we Overlook see that's where God's at right all right that's the reason I pray God help me out when I come to church don't let me just come to church don't let me just listen yeah until they'll be listening come on but Lord show me what I need what is it what is it that you want me to hear and you know it doesn't matter who is preaching or who you know because it's it's one of what the Lord wants to show you right right amen amen I can't remember who it was uh they were talking about uh my member of Keith Brown when he was here talking about those two top two top singers that make him want to sing good ones and bad ones you know you look at some people you know some of some of the things that God has showed me in the word has been some of the greatest messages and some of the worst messages yeah right oh yeah because you know what it takes somebody to preaches something that's wrong okay come on Amen sure because when something when something is preached that's wrong come on when you hear something that's off and then you sit there and you know I've had things it's like trying to figure out and there's been times like you know Lord I don't you know because it takes a while but something called you you know you catch them and sometimes it takes a while before that becomes clear too right and sometimes things just pop off the page yet you'll catch things and somebody's preaching things and you'll see things open right up and you'll say well that's that's just the saith Lord you can see that just true it just clears as a bail it's just perfect but see it takes those things because when it comes down you'll catch those things because he's trying to show you things because some people they just they don't they don't catch you know some people as we said some people don't have any deserve it they just want anything right yeah man that's right yeah sure they're not catching what God has to say that's right because there's oil run around you know God said a problem brother Brandon speaking of speaking of a prophet you know if he takes you to another God right come on brother doesn't matter what he does you gotta watch what he says see if it lines up right you know there's one thing about the Apostle Paul you know the Apostle Paul when he came and started preaching you know he went back to the back to the Old Testament and started bringing up whatever what the Old Testament had to say to show you Christ amen father calls he said Christ laid all the way through the Old Testament come on everything that everything that was in the Old Testament taught Christ right see we say like I said if you don't see Christ in that reverse go back and look all right man and what did Brother Brown do he come back and said I preach the same thing Paul prays you know many times and I started looking this up trying to figure out see different things you know brother that's what I think he always done because he's out of my typologies all right yep you know you know and that's where he'd always go back to the Old Testament and pick things up and he would bring things from the Old Testament and bring things right in and he would show you the same thing that Paul preached because the Old Testament had it yep so that's one other thing that stands out about marriage and divorce you he said Paul Moses gave her grace yeah blew my mind he said Moses gave a Grace Paul gave a Grace and then he had a great stuff because it was the Sith Lord here he was bringing all the way through the scripture that's right see people think he added something or he changed something another related in the scripture the whole time amen but it took it but it took a prophet on wanting to see her someone that could look into the scripture and see these names because God had to come and show it and it's it's late in the scripture all this time right and yeah yeah we miss it that's right that's right see we can but we have we have been given the eyesight amen but you've got to use it right right see we've got to come to a place that we're using this eyesight right see we're we're a blessed people yeah we are so blessed that God what God has given us all right because you you think all the way through time people that people have desired to look at one and see what we have seen that's right and what we have heard because it has been laid before us amen that's right and see Paul continuing on here speaking of these things see we we have had a a Ministry because as continue on in the scripture here and he does a foundation that's been laid Yeah he said he said with a foundation he says I'm wise master builder he laid a foundation and then he goes on and speaks and he says let every man take Keith how you build if they're a pond man see there's been there's been a foundation laid for us amen and see it's been and we've got to come back to that same Foundation because there's only one foundation and that's Christ because he said he said because Upon This Rock I'll build my church and anybody that's in that church has got to go back to that same rock that same Foundation to build upon right yes sir and then here in the scripture we'll continue it on it in chapter three he says verse 12 says now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stone wood hay stubble he said every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is that's right that's right see if you look at some of these things that that Paul speaks of here excuse me because he talks about Haywood or stubble you know they're all consumed by fire right that's right amen but the first two you know gold and silver see they can be refined by five that's right so you're hearing something about these things he said because if you put the because that's what you want to do with gold you want to put it in the fire because it because it becomes greater because you're able to get all the impurity all the dross and everything out of it but he said every man's work shall be made manifest so you've got to come back to that Foundation because whatever is built upon that foundation will be made manifest amen and you've got to come back to that and every man has to come back and build on what he said right right because you know the Apostle Paul said even if I come back and preach something different than what I've already preached he said let me be a curse because I've got to build On My Own Foundation right because you know he said he said it he said follow me as I follow Christ because it wasn't it wasn't Paul preaching a message because it wasn't following the foundation but it was Christ laying the foundation through Paul so when Paul was laying upon it see he realized this Foundation came through God so everybody has to come back to this same Foundation right see that's the reason that a lot of people well there's not a lot of new genuine new births these big holes people are coming back to the same Foundation because we're not coming back to what what Paul preached right because they just allow anything to happen and even in when brother Brennan came back and and preached the new birth and came back to exactly what Paul said it was right and brought it out of the scripture to understand what the new birth was and then they turned around and say well brother Brandon didn't preach the new birth yeah right brother Brandon pricked something different oh yeah sure and every single time and you know you look at uh was it future home he covers the same thing in birth pains right so you you think about it uh now I think there was one other places I was reading my brother I was I was speaking on the same thing so you know everybody says well after the sales he prints something different but they're but there there was he said in the mouth of two or three Witnesses there's two different places where he breaks the exactly exactly what he preached the whole time and even in a few I believe future home he actually said you know I've always preached this so I mean just by based on what he said he he understood what he was talking about the problem is is people don't see right they were in a state of confusion but see we come back and we have to build on that same Foundation because brother random come back you know he said we had to come back and preach everything that Paul preached and it started with a new birth but it was a continuation of opening of the work to come back to the same place that he had preached yep right yeah we can build on that that we can that brother Bradham could come and bring his message so it had to come back to the beginning and so we see that he says if every man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire he said no you're not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you right right see if we if we realize Who We Are yeah we have we have one promise we have a we have a problems we have a guarantee right he said how did he the spirit of Truth has come that's it and not just come but come right right see it's not it's not that that he just come down but that he has to come down in you amen right that's right see it becomes an indwelling then he said he shall lead you and guide you in all truth right okay see it has to it has to become that indwelling so that he can lead you guide you all things because he said no you not that ye are the temple of God right and not just not just we know the temple of God but we are the temple of God as a body of Christ we are we are in we are the temple of God because it's all collectively together right amen because we all work together we all come into into this body as one so we make up the temple of God Amen and that's what he's talking about he continues on speaking of coming into this place where he said If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are yes Lord that's right see when people speak of that see it goes back to what I was speaking of earlier it goes back to the unconfessed sin right hmm and that's what that's what makes the ministry so important amen because and I can't remember who it was but somebody was was preaching and they were and they were talking about uh you know why don't why do Pastors let things go on in the church we see things and you know why don't want to just jump up there and just pound that thing right yeah you know and it's like well maybe he's waiting on the Lord yeah yeah sure you know it's just like rather random you know in questions and answers talking to talking on marriage and divorce and you know he waited until the time that he was given a commission to do that right absolutely that's right see because because you know he said enter all the churches apart you know I mean he got he knew what was later in the scripture but he had to come to a time that he could that he could preach there right right and it's not and it's not that it's not seen in the church but maybe maybe they have to wait for a time that their that things have to come into place that something can be said or something you know that things will come into place then it's not that it's not that you know the pastor comes the pulpit and right see because I'm not in that position and I thank God I'm not in that position but he is and he has and he has and then has to come to that place he has to figure out what God wants him to do exactly because the worst the worst mistake that brother Dale could do is get up here and try to do things in his own self exactly amen amen and without without having the because God wants us to come to a place that we have wisdom right yeah and that's one of the things you've got to wait on him for that he can give you that right that's correct to give you the answer because it all has to come work together into this in this the plan so we wonder I'm confess sin see he said he said you can you make a whole attorney barely failed all the things that you can do that you can hinder someone see just like just like that that man that was the preacher yeah uh brother I was talking about you know just hung it up walked away yeah right so if I love the Lord I preach but I don't throw up his card and threw it in the trash you've done it finished brother Brian said the the one true sign the show that he was of God exactly that he was a Son of God was it God took him exactly wouldn't allow him to act that way right right I see if we go if we're going to have unconfessed sin and and what I was going to say earlier if you if you're going to a church an unconfessed sin it's a long it sits there forever just years and years and years just things that sit you you want to I've seen it happen too many times right to not to know it yeah that you want you watch churches and if if a pastor would turn a blind eye to sin in a church I said you wait and see he'll start preaching false doctors right right that thought because you wait you let down the devil have a strong you know foothold anywhere next thing you know you're you're washed away right because you give him a little bit and he'll take them out right sir that's reason that's reason the scripture tells us to abstain from all appearance of evil right right you get you can't even have the appearance of it if it looks bad even if it's not bad if it looks bad don't have it right amen exactly amen we are the temple of God Amen and so we know we have to know how to act I'm back in front of each other amen and in front of the world right that's it it's not it's not just how we act at church around Believers it's how we act in front of the world right you know there's a lot of people in the world that they never hand out a message book they've never quoted a scripture oh yeah sure they've never said anything but their life is their sermon right yeah their life is their testimony right the life that they live and I believe it was brother Biscoe was the one that was was speaking of how his how his father came to be saved was was a was a lady and I think it was two two girls her two daughters were there and you know he saw the life that that woman live right you know brother Brandon said just be soft and brother and I believe it's brother biscal's dad and he was so moved by that woman by the life that she leave me man and those two kids that he comes to her and said how do I be saved right amen amen because he was so moved by her testimony and it wasn't that she was out trying to preach the gospel right she lifted amen and that's what that's what's more important is to live is to live the life that's right he said that we can if we can die daily and let him live through us all right that if he if he's the one living the life that everybody ought to see Jesus Christ that's right it's not it's not that we have to get up and preach it it ought to be lived I said that that's that's my whole desire but is that people can see Jesus Christ in me right amen I don't want to I don't want to be one that they all has to beat on has to step on my toes I want to be the one right that the Holy Ghost thinks amen because if the Holy Ghost is dwelling in me that I want to be so yielded to him that I can line up and I don't have to be told amen because you know that that is a growth development amen that because I was preaching one time and there's a little boy sitting with his mama and I said you know there Comes A Time in your life I said when you get big enough when you got a runny nose you wipe your own nose yeah right you don't make somebody to walk it for you yeah and that Mama Turned that little boy anyway so obviously he would you know he got to the point where his mom was trying to tell him the same thing if it's old enough to wipe his own right hey sometimes that's the way it is you know we got as they say it's time to put on our big boy that's right you know we've got we've got to grow up man we've got we've got to come to the place that if if he's the dwelling inside of us that he's going to bring us to that place yeah then but we've got to come to that point right right we need we need that we don't need to be waiting any longer because we never know how much longer we're going to be back because that's what I that's what I'm looking for I'm looking to get out of here because if you see the condition of the world today you know how many people would believe that we'd be in the world be in the condition that it is in today you know how many how many you know you go back and look and see the see the founder the founders of this nation that we that we love so much I thank God I'm American yes sir I wouldn't want to live anywhere else that's right right I've only been in two other countries I've been in Jamaica and I've been in Mexico and I thank God when I cross back in there all right that's right I went you know because you know the if I didn't know where the international border was to the United States and Mexico I'd have never known I was in Mexico because a long time before I got there I was me and a few other folks we were the only white folks around and we found out that we didn't because everybody else was speaking Spanish and I didn't have no idea where I was at uh because I asked somebody I said we crossed the border yet it's like no you'll know when you crossed the border yeah yeah there's a lot of folks down there in uniforms with guns standing on the line that's right you know there were dogs and stuff checking cars going back and forth you know when you reach the when you're at the international border now when I was so I mean it's nice to go and visit but why couldn't wait to get back across yeah when I come back from Jamaica that lady asked me said you got anything to declare I said I declare I'm an American I love Jamaica but I wouldn't want to live there amen I love them brother Keith and all of them over there but I tell you what I like being here that's right I was so glad to be home yeah I just like to have some more of that Jamaican food every now and then yeah I'll go over there and eat a while yeah and I'm I'm so glad that God has given me but who would believe right you think anybody come on yep and you know you go to Washington and they spent and I'm gonna stop here a little bit you don't watch it when they spent millions of dollars and we've had these great monuments built of these Great Men and we have these great big pieces of marble and we have etched their words on there you think about that a five dollar bill we got Abraham Lincoln all right and the reason I like Abraham Lincoln because that's my birthday we share the same birthday February 12th I didn't know that so I have lots of books on he's always been one of my heroes but you think about all the things that Abraham Lincoln said they got marble big piece of marble all kind of stuff that's the airplane X books books books books books people go to college and the only thing they do their entire life they're a Lincoln historian yeah yeah they study everything that Abraham Lincoln ever said every place he ever been everything he ever done every every medical condition the man ever had yeah yeah they know it all and he wrote these words you can't make the poor Rich of making the rich Poker come on and you can't help them by taking away from the poor yeah all right that's paraphrasing but you know what I'm talking about right and he wrote all these things you can't strengthen the Weak by weakening the strong come on and he also wrote understand it and all these great words Abraham Lincoln said but my favorite my favorite one is this and it's a paraphrase but you can look it up and he said after I he said after this old with and I've laid down the Reigns of power he said if I don't have one another friend left in this world he said I have one and he's in me amen I tell you what that's fixed volume but you look at Abraham Lincoln we have all these great things that Abraham Lincoln says now I want you to look up here we spend money we got to preserve all that everything Abraham Lincoln President Lincoln he was wonderful wonderful yet he gave us in his own words the principles to live by right and you know what trample underfoot right we could care less what he had to say Amen because you know what we're going to live how we want to come on and you look at you look at things George Washington he's like he's like a great man of George Washington got a great Monument up there all right you know he could have been king that's right when he had when he was when he was a Kong when he was the general of the Continental Army every man that served under him they said he loved him him so much they'd have died for him yeah and all he had to say was you know what I'm gonna become a monarch I'm taking over and I'm gonna be a leader do you know what who would have stopped it he had the Army behind him right and yet he walked in there he was such a Christian and such a gentleman he said this is this is what we have fought for and he laid down that power and he stepped back yeah and it was a group of men that came together he could have been he could have been he could have been the King right sure but you know what he knew what what we were what we fought for right and we wanted to have this great nation and because of what he done and what a great leader he was that's the reason he became the first president of the United States and you go back and you read the things that he talked about and you know what they could care less that's exactly right these men these men and we started out we had to win you know we had a debt when we got a when we got our independence do you know what it costs it cost us money and do you know that the first man that came in this in this country Alexander Hamilton and those you know they were the ones that were working on getting us out of debt all right and you know that was that was the one thing that we wanted to have in this nation when we started was ability to pay our own debt right and you know what we've gotten to the point we're down 200 some odd years later people are talking about our government defaulting on its loans is this government going to be having enough money to pay its own bills blessing you think about all these great men that have lived through time all the things they've done and what they have done and all that they gave the Blood Sweat and Tears to come to this place and then see the kind of condition that we're in right why because we've we've walked away from our own principles that's right yeah right and not only not only say is that a natural Condition it's a spiritual condition you better believe that amen same difference see we we have walked away from our own principles we have we had a spirit I mean because you go back and look all those men Abraham Lincoln George Washington all the all Thomas Jefferson the different ones and uh even Ben Franklin you know I was reading something about Ben Franklin you know he was he was a prayer you know he was a little weird babies are praying man but you look and see what these men done I see the condition that we're in but you know God you know brother Adam told us God told him you know we turned we turned we turned God down exactly so we're in we're in the condition that we're in that's right you know brother man said that the only you know everybody in the world would be insane the whole world be insane except for the broad that's right that's true and that's that's all that's all that you have to be insane there's you can't you can't be anything else but insane right when you decide we're going we're going to uh run this government and we're going to spend more money than we can ever take in yeah but you know we're still gonna believe this thing to work out and they said well you know we're not going to run this train off the cliff listen it's heading off the cliff and it don't matter you know guess what the break is broke all right that's right but you said you see how you see and who would believe this could this this country would have gotten this condition that's right but it has right and you know what it's just yeah it's just another sign to tell us it's coming to an end right right amen the only thing the only thing because a lot of these things it's just details it's just things happening but we know what's going to take place in the end all right exactly because it's just to get us ready right right that's right amen because there's nothing there's nothing in this world that's going to be that's going to stand except for the word that's right he said having an Arthur pass away but my word you see there's no other place to stand but on the Rock right that's right and I'm so thankful that I have a place to stand all right that's right so we that we have this place that that I know that I know My Redeemer Lives that I know that I have been birthed that I know that I have been sealed right because you know that that is worth more to me than anything right that's right to know that to have that Assurance that's that's the greatest thing in the world Amen but you know what there's more there's more than what we have now amen yeah yeah and the thing is is for us to stand up and walk and claim what's ours come on amen amen you love him let's all stand man thank you Lord foreign I just moved it out and feel better I must have bigger ears too or something

freely given to us of God Amen right he says which things also we speak not in the in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen you know what I was very interesting do you know what the word compare me compare doesn't mean uh like we would think of comparing apples and oranges looking at two different things right actually it means to look at something and in the Greek it also means to combine and I was going to bring this up and and really struggling he says comparing spiritual things with spiritual you know the scripture that come to my mind he said prove all things hold fast to that which is good amen right comparing spiritual Faith with spiritual it's not just comparing things but holding on to that which is good which is do you see that is true but only says spiritual these things are freely given to us and he said comparing you look at it you discern it and then you hold on to it right because he said line upon line precept upon priesthood that's right and it's all built together but I'm so glad that these things were given to us all right amen glory you know we have to receive it amen amen
