from my report they said they had a real good time at the fellowship meeting yesterday and enjoyed that so was glad of you that was able to go and and be there and all we we really appreciate it I talked to brother Lora he's doing better about the the thing but uh keep him in Prior because he does have uh he said we're very small uh amount of postate cancer so they don't know how far but they did give him the treatments you know of the needles or what you call it and stuff like that and got that done so he said they was just to keep praying for it he said that was the main thing all right uh brother Donnie something you was going to say about problem break right there was somebody tried to break into one of their one of their stores broke into it but uh nothing no problems or nothing so that's where brother Mark is this morning trying to get all of that straightened out okay all right so Hebrews 12 and John 3 Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your love and your grace unto us we thank you for Calvary thank you for all things and we just ask you Lord to be with us today as we try to speak about you and to meditate upon the things that you would bring to our remembrance from the scriptures and the things Lord Lord that we have heard that we may be able to try to put those things into the right perspective of where we're living or the hour that we're here and we pray that you would just do as you said you would do you promised it so we can depend on it that you said you'd come on the scene and bring your word and that you would heal us and Deliver Us from destruction have your way Lord and just guide each one and bless Lord in Jesus name amen all right Hebrews 12 12 1 and 2 wherefore seeing you also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God now let's go to John because we're going to be hitting this a little bit so let's go to John uh three and 16 is a very familiar verse with all of us right amen for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved now here's a verse we want to get to he that believeth on him is not condemned all right now that's hold that point but he that believeth not is condemned already he don't have to go to judgments he don't have to do anything there will be a judgment there will be a time but there won't be no court of appeal right why because of what he's doing see all right but but he that believeth not is condemned already because he ha not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God you may be seated to Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now what I want to do is kind of tie in with something that uh you know make sure you understood what I was trying to bring um last Sunday and then uh you know go on into maybe a little bit deeper into what our thought was but if you remember what we were trying to talk about Sunday was what is the worst sin that you can think of and see we would say murder we would say uh a rapist uh um you know all kind of things that we would try to uh talk about those things as being but now remember now drinking gambling smoking running around with women murder uh rapist and that's not sin right yeah it is well see that's what you've been taught all your life well you haven't been taught the scriptural form you've been taught that you you you you know the the things and all like you've been taught that that's sin now drinking gambling smoking stuff like that anything you could think of is not sin that's an attribute or a display right now remember even the garden what went first not to act it was first and then she thought you know no it was her thinking and rejecting the word of God that caused her to display right the things that we call sin and I like I told you I guess that's the hardest thing because if you'll look how many times a prophet says it but that was probably the hardest thing for him to explain right amen I I don't believe he had as much trouble on marriage and divorce you know I'm just honest as he did on trying to explain to people about Sin right cuz you remember the L she just couldn't stand it finally she just said brother random what is sin then if you're saying it's not drinking gambling and smoking and so what is it he said it's unbelief amen unbelief he said now the reason you do those things is because you're an unbeliever all right now we're getting it scripturally correct without running it into the wrong point you know and see then uh you're not going to go to hell for lying and cheating and stealing that's just part of your life it's it's not what we think then I want to make sure you follow that point it's not what we we do like that as something will you know look at that person I remember we were down at my mother-in-laws on one day day on a Sunday afternoon and there was some company there and I seemed like I remember when my dad-in-law was sick or something but anyhow uh we were there and outside and some some good religious people was there and I'm not throwing off on them I'm I mean that rightly uh but they were standing out there talking well a neighbor over there you know he just it's on Sunday he just got his lawnmower out and and he just cranked it up and started cutting his G you know boy one of them ladies it was all she could stand she said he's going to die and go to hell for cutting that Grace on Sunday well no he's not going to die and go to hell for cutting grce on Sunday you're not going to die and go to hell for murder rapist anything you're not going to do it for that you're going to die and go to hell because of disbelief right amen cuz what happened to Eve in the garden did not the prophet make the statement he said she failed on one scripture and that used to bother me until it was made known she failed on Hebrews 138 well you know Hebrews 138 wasn't written back there but what is the point of Hebrews 138 that he's the same yesterday today and forever right because that's what it's saying all right see then we talk about sin as being some hideous thing and that's what we've been taught all of our life and then it's hard to Define you know to people to get them to thinking correctly well you think it's all right to go kill steal do I didn't say that may I quote the prophet I'll be glad to find you this one I was reading it yesterday he said you say brother brandom said that guy killed somebody somebody that guy done this or that or the other he said that don't have anything to do with me he said I'm a preacher I'm trying to get him converted AB he said it's up to the law to put him in jail well now what sensible answer would they be for that amen you know the law is to put him into jail all right then he's condemned by the law but you think about it that we try to Define sin and and there is no such thing as a little sin and a big sin so get all that out of your mind see all right and I wasn't trying to express that last Sunday I was trying to express something that I hope would catch on to you as as to your thinking all right because uh you know I've always considered the point what is sin well we're just a bunch of Sinners well then to turn around and the Bible says that if you say you have not sinned you're a liar right and you say if you don't have no sin you're a liar but then it turns around and says he that is born of God sinth not right now to my understanding those are two opposite directions right all right but if they don't come together then we're going to still be as we were back there right and we're going on to Define sin and have a problem out of it all right so now don't misunderstand me as to thinking that I would think everything's all right for us to do this or that or the other no no I I've I've been blunt I've been plain uh you know I I know I'm I'm I'm too plain but I'm blunt you know I mean I've always said you don't have to worry about it here some of you some of you get mistreating your children in the wrong way way I'll turn you into the law now I don't mean a spanking and I don't mean getting you bail out and raising a blister and I don't mean that but if you abuse your children I'll call the law is that plain enough to let you know where I stand that I'm not far it being okay to do this that or the other no but I'm just saying you're not going to die and go to hell for for doing things wrong Jesus said he that believeth not is condemned already all right so then it's not something that we do or don't do right am the ACT Eve done in the Gard was a display of her unbelief but she'd already beli Satan's lie the other was just a dis a display all right so you understand what a prophet would say drink and G and smok and stuff like that it's not sin he said that's a display of unbelief he said you do those things because you don't believe all right and so we put those things in a category and we try to understand then to turn around as I said and we say if we say that we don't have no sin we're liars and I gave you some quotes and we'll read them again in a minute where the Prophet was talking about what a Christian is the only one that can sin because a sinner he just condemned already what he's doing is not sin that's what we look at oh look at that sin out there look at that sin out there about that that prostitute house at that that beer joint that that place and all now we don't agree with all that but that's not those people are just unbelievers but now when we were trying to talk about Christians being the only ones that sined we was not talking about Christians drinking gambling smoking running around with women committing adultery we we've explained that to the point last Sunday that we were not talking about that we were talking about the little everyday life things that we as human beings are caught in those situations and things go wrong because now if you don't understand you say well brother Dale you know like I said Sunday you say well brother Dale you're just so deep you just get into these deep things how much more simple would it be for you to get an understanding that because you stump your toe and say fooy if you're not going to die and go to hell now don't tell me come on I'm human 74 years old okay you said you don't know all of us I'm going to hit every one of us every one of us has got little bitty problems if you don't have a little bitty problem pray for everybody else your problem is you don't know you got a problem amen right you don't know that you are won't admit that you've got a problem all right that's the biggest problem there is why because that's something God can't deal with you know that God can't deal with something that we won't repent of right right he he he can't deal with it why because we won't repent of it but if we'll repent of the Bible said he's just and if we say we don't have no sin why did Paul say that we have an advocate or John there in the scripture well why do you need an advocate if you don't have something wrong but now do you understand what I'm saying we're not talking about that well brother Dale say it's all right for them Christians to commit adultery do this no no no no we're talking about everyday life we're talking about where that the Bible would say that we have sin yet the same Bible would say he that is born of God does not commit sin all right we tried in the denominations to define the word commit and we tried to make it like a something well it was over this way over that way and why not just face it up straight but now for brother brandom to say that we sin every day for brother random to say Paul said I Die daily for Paul to say the things I would not I do and I do not and all are in the scripture then he defines it when he gets down to the end he says with our by with the inward man I serve the law of God right all right so that inward man can't sin because it's born again is that correctly right understanding right but he said but with the flesh I serve the law of sin did Paul say it was all right to go do wrong no he's explaining everyday life he's not explaining adultery fornication no he's explaining simple everyday life is anybody in here today would raise your hand and say CU if you raise it and say I'm going to call you a liar so you ain't going to raise your hand but would anybody say you ain't had a wrong thought today I mean well if if you got a wrong thought you sinned is it wrong to have a wrong thought you see I know that I'm hard in the way that I say things but you think about it you know the devil tempted the Lord Jesus so he had to have the wrong thoughts right that's right did he sin no oh come on then it's not a sin to have a wrong thought it's a sin to entertain the thought you can't help the thought coming but you can help what you do with it that's right right the entertaining of the thought is the problem you can't have what the devil keep shooting into your mind you go crazy as a bat trying to stop it from coming in leave it alone just let it come and say God forgive me but now here's the point don't let it go to where you say well brother brand said it and Paul and brother he's preaching that that it's all right to have him wrong thought I didn't say it's all right to have them I said you're going to have them it's not all right to have them because when you say it's all right to have them then you're you're making it sin right well brother Dale what is sin the Bible says he that believeth not is condemned already amen the prophet said in quoting the scripture where it talks about the sins he said only Christians have sins he said we sin every day right now what sin is he speaking of come on what sin is he speaking of so there must be some things that's not dealing with the finality of understanding what sin really is you can say well the reason those people died there in sin well Jesus died now you well okay he took my okay that's okay I go with you that's all right but brother randam was the one that said we sin every day and Paul said we sin every day and John said we sin every day now what were they talking about that was what I was trying to get to point across Sunday you know that the Bible says anything that is not a faith is s i n eating too much none of us has got that problem and just because Joy is as skinny as a rail she eat like a horse so now we just display it like Esther and need it you know and sister Monica I told a while ago to move over away from the vent downstairs the draw V I said that thing will suck you up to there cuz a lot of people are just naturally skinny but it's not the fact that they don't eat so then they look at us and say y'all eat too much no I look back at them and say hey wait a minute you eat more than I do it's just a manifestation in this thing that makes me fat all right now but just making a point what is sin what would they be that we could comprehend as understanding that would not Place us in a category of being lost cuz the Bible said if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice Paul you admit doing wrong yep he was a guy that said it you said sin willfully you know what the prophet said one day he said will even will hopefully do wrong abely knowing we're going to get a whooping I'm not talking about the guy running out in front of him you say do he like I told a man at work one day down there he said people do things like that to me he said I just have to say dirty words I said why don't you say praise the Lord right you got to say something you hit your finger with a hammer and you let out all them four-letter words why don't you say Thank You Lord it didn't bust the thing and turn it totally off why don't you say praise the Lord right might put us in different category I think it's good to be that way you know what who was it um in the war you know who was it Stonewall Jackson he he Saidi never take a drink of water that I don't thank God I dropped something on the ground and I begin to look for it first off I realize it's F down there now there some reason I can't see it like I used to and then the other reason it's down there that I can't bend over and get it all right but that still don't change nothing and I find a screw or something I dropped and I said Thank You Lord thank you Lord devil said I was the one that showed it to you said well thank you for showing it to me you remember the the lady was praying for food and these kids brought it to her and set it on her porch and she was out screaming of Glory Hallelujah the lord gave me some and the kids come up said ah we was one that brought it to you she said Lord thank you for the food and the ones that f it you know the ones that brought it here all right now but what is sin that's what I trying to defined last week the Bible says there is a sin un death that's right and Paul says I say don't pray for him right know that scripture but there's a sin not un death right am so then evidently there's something about this word sin that we need to Define and think about it you know and say well some of the things of Life as we do naturally every day is not a sent unto death it may be a wrong thought it may be a thing that we say it may be a point I don't I don't like that cuz most people you know they they think it's nothing wrong but you know they'll they hit their hand hit her finger and they they do that little d a r n you know that I don't even like to pronounce well that's not sin well I didn't say it was I think it's a dirty mouth why didn't you say praise the Lord now I hear some of you say that so okay I'm picking on you I don't think you ought to say it goz why you just never have thought in your life that that was wrong to do right but you see Church we're not going to go to hell for the little bitty things in our problems in our life that's been my whole point we're going to go to hell for unbelief we we don't need to profit to Define sin now you understand that statement right the Bible plainly tells you what sin is that's right is to disbelieve God Amen he that believeth not is condemned already am and then we try to make it to be something that you know a problem and it is a problem because we're human nature that's right right human nature all right but think about it unbelief we gave the quote where the Prophet used it and it's wonderful where he unbelief in what he said in God's word which is God all right but brother Dale I don't disbelieve well I believe everything the prophet says so that the two Soul people the seventh th virtue people the peria people the peria people the the son of man people the any more doctrines going to count in the message and every one of them says they believe every word of God have you ever been to a church where they said we believe all the word except a few words and we don't believe that and we'll put them in your box where you can understand what we don't believe I had found that yet have you every everybody Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals right everybody says they believe everything God says was listening to a tape the other night and I knew brother Brandon was making a point and he said look at it this way he said if you ask the people he was talking about denominational people now all over and he said you ask the people that they believe in Jesus Christ and said they'll say yes said do you ask them to to believe or do you ask them do they believe that he's almighty God in flesh said they yes and I thought come on now I don't want to fast forward but you're fixing to say something and he gave a few more illustrations of things and saying that if we would say Do you believe that Jesus Christ come and died for our sins to come and live in us to give us a new birth he said they'd say yes right ever Den in the world ever bromite ever hites or who or lulaes all right right and I thought come on and here's where he made that statement about it that let me just get on to the point he finally made this statement he said but you say to the people do they believe I'm paraphrasing however pretty close that they believe that he's a Healer today like he used to be he said said they'll say now right there we don't really know he said that's unbelief now what about it they go along with all of the things up to maybe a onepoint thing I've had people to ask me brother Gary's good at asking me about it he asked me one time he said do you think we've got the faith of the fathers I wasn't explaining to him I had it I was explaining that I believed it was here for the people and somebody had it all right and see others people would say no because in the the book of Acts it says Silver and Gold Have I None rise up and walk we don't see that taking place the reason is because of your unbelief that's right now if you tell me it's not I want you to explain one scripture I want you to explain one thing if you make God great in one age and lesser in another age you are in the worst sin that could be because you're denying Hebrews 13:8 right right that's right now come on well he just not doing like he used to do back there that's what the prophet was making that statement he said we come down to a point that we say well he's an every point but one thing now what did he say he said he's an every way except the Corporal body and thereby that makes him he Hebrews 13:8 that's the way he's saying it amen well brother D I just don't see things happening well you know why because you don't believe it and you know what like I said we can stand here and make statements of 5 six or something like that statements about the dead being raised and not a person has called to ask about that or said we're coming to church cuz we want to be in a church that it's not going don't worry about it it's over with that's right they're not going to come flock in if the dead was raised every service right here they're not going to come oh there'll be a few stragglers but the main point is they'll say a them only ones right you got to do something if you say the Dead's not being raised in our congregation right but are you following me you see how easy it is to be an unbeliever it believeth not is condemned already if you don't believe he's the same in every age I don't give a hoot about your thoughts or mind either one about we don't see and you say well we don't see like it does in the book of Acts well you're an unbeliever Y come on but yet I'm sarcastic and hateful and arrogant old dude for saying it like that but is Hebrews 138 still right amen sir brother Bram said there's no need for anybody to say that if we was just back there he said cause he's the same in every age amen when I just don't see it then you're an unbeliever right and you'll never see it as long as you stay an unbeliever I've been plain about it honest you take the book of Acts and how long that was that's a 30 40 year period or something right is it right covering the book of Acts or covering Calvary over or whatever to the F till you come up to ad 53 somewhere start the first church age 20 years or something and write down how many miracles took place and you'd see that there's probably one per year you don't look at that I got a little thought in a minute when we get down to that you don't look at that brother randam would say more miracles in one meeting done by the Lord Jesus Christ than is in is in the entire Bible now that's what he said but oh if it was just brother brandom was here brother told me one day he said that's a good statement and he said' I've dealt with it a lot but he said if God's here in you what's the difference in that God that's right I said thank you that didn't make me nothing it makes God something but you see how easy it would be to go into unbelief that was what I was trying to explain last week if sin is unbelief then we don't count the little small things that we looked at as a wrong thought as being sin or a uh little temper oh bless God don't Christian don't have no temper I want to back up may I back up to the P to the and say that Peter said we need Temperance he said now that's not that uncontrollable temper no it's the little things of life but now brother D no such thing as a big sin a little sin I'm glad you thought that because you just send your way out of the day of Grace you just went into unbelief because you got to Define it some way to where the human being can stand as a human being that's got problems as human beings I've defined that over and over when I will again we're not talking about Grambling smoking running around with we're talking about everyday little things just little problems little wrong thoughts right is that going to send us to hell no cuz now remember I asked the question what is the worst sin you could think of and I'm sure a lot of you thought about it I didn't Express much then really not knowing I would bring this but I guess the Lord knew how to handle it you'd say well brother Dale to blaspheme the Holy Ghost is the worst sin there is all right now what is blaspheming the Holy Ghost he said mama said it was for you to take a baby you know before it was born and and do away with it that was blaspheming he said the preacher said it was somebody killed somebody right but you know Paul comes over in his writings and he says adulterous hor mongers and etc etc he names a big long list of everything you could think of the feminists you know this day every how you pronounce that word if feminist you know wrongdoing men and women Y and he said such won't enter Heaven right and that's true it won't be no wh mongers and adulterous and things in heaven right that's true but then what did he turn around and say he said but such were some of you amen he said but now you are clean now you're set aside and make clean amen God's different from what we think am amen I'm glad of that amen but what is sin brother random we gave it last week but we'll give it again as the eagle stir at her nest number four if they want to pull it up what is that's sin when a man or a woman doubts the word of God it's sin he that believeth not is condemned already that's right he that he that condemneth believeth not a condemned not is condemned already do you believe that so what is sin unbelief he said if you got unbelief in your heart pray now if a Christian is the only one that can have sins that they have to answer for and The Sinner a sinner's not going up to the white throne and God give him a long list of line and says you done this and you done that you done this no he just walk up front and look at him he I done have better of it right right right because it could be brought as a flashback in front of him the computer age is really made it marvelous to my understanding about how God can do things at the white Throne man you can just pull up a person's life right now you know what they sent me me and brother Joe pulled it up Wednesday because I don't have the the uh all them things y'all have cuz I don't fool with them and brother Joe run it off and they sent me a note that I need to put some air in my right front tire now that's pretty technical for them to tell me I need to put some a in my right front tire they call you and tell you when your oil needs changing they call and tell you when your brakes are worn out y we're in an age when everything can be brought up well a sinner he won't have to walk up there and then give him a long list of reasons he's going to hell he just knows he's going to hell but what's the problem is what guy comes up there it says I done this i' done that but he said get away from here I never knew you see Christians are only only one that can sin right but what about blaspheming the Holy Ghost what is it to blashe the Holy Ghost you want two quotes you want to quote where brother randam said it's impossible for a Christian to blaspheme the Holy Ghost but now what are you going to do with the other one where he says a Christian can blashe you see it takes the Holy Spirit to know what it's all about it takes a holy spirit to know the difference between sin of unbelief and life of natural living right if you don't get nothing out of this what I've been last Sunday and this sun get that one thing there's things in our life that is not right but yet we're not called a sinner on account of it because we haven't disbelieved God's word now yours where it comes down to it I've put an open challenge to the world if you think I'm off the message then you come and show me that's a pretty good challenge but you know what I wouldn't want a lot of the other people that's on the internet to make that challenge because I just go see them yeah amen and I tell them here's where you're off and here's where you're off well come and show me where I'm off now not where we believe white dog black dog red and green what would you know pity Petty pet a little I'm talking about sh me where I've just believe the message right but you don't like that see preachers that's why they don't want me out there preaching is why because when I go preach I preach straight I don't get into doctrines or ideas or things I try to be straight but when I F it straight that's it I don't have no gray areas about the message or the Bible I said there must be a definition some way there must be an understanding if the prophet would say and the Bible would say that we sin every day but yet the same Bible would say that it's impossible for us to sin right so then we know what it is from the inward man Paul said he cannot sin that's right cuz he's born of God Amen it's not me it's him right but the outward man I still work according to the flesh right the flesh lives and so did the Flesh of Jesus live and he had to keep it under subjection right right that's right all right you see I don't mind talking plain because I understand I hope sometimes that what is to blashe why is it a Christian cannot blashe when the definition of blaspheming is really attributing the works of God to the devil right they're saying the devil made him do it when they made fun of Jesus what did he say now why did he make this statement he said all manner of wordings or unbelief or what you're doing against the son of man can be forgiven but said when he the Holy Ghost has come come on you know what so that meant nobody didn't have it but him right I hope some of you click on to that one because you're still pondering whether or not the Old Testament Saints had the holy ghost or not that's plain enough right there he's saying in a future date the holy spirit's going to come and one word against that won't be forgiven but yet the Apostle Paul coming over there in the scriptures and he said I compell them people we used to say you know cause them whatever it really says I compel them people to blaspheme that's right in other words he made them blaspheme right well the worst thing would be if somebody you make somebody do something would be worse than your unbelief right well look what he's saying no wonder the man winds up one day and he says I'm a chiefest of Sinners making people blasing the Holy Ghost yet he said I've done it what ignorantly right so they there ignorance goes a long ways with God right and I'm glad of it amen like I've always said one of these days I'll get ner enough to preach on God with amnesia because how can he forget when I can't and he can't keep no records and I do but listen go ahead with number one and then I'll try to find this other one uh pull number one up oh we want to read that one 3:16 through 319 of Hebrews chapter 6 Jesus said I'll forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost has come you speak a word against it and never be forgiven you because they said he has an unclean Spirit now why does he calling it blaspheming cuz they said he had an unclean Spirit they said that was B above doing it right right a Christian can't do that a Christian will always call the spirit of God righteousness see a Christian cannot blast BL the Holy Ghost it's The Outsiders that blaspheme that wasn't Christians standing there it was religious people it was Orthodox Jews doctors of divinity and so forth and they were making fun of him and his words calling the works of God that it was an unclean Spirit doing it in words they said it's what it done come on down to where we're at make fun of the operation of the spirit just as paulish scholar slick as a button right but to make fun of the Holy Ghost and therefore they blaspheming don't make light of nobody that's right amen you see somebody shouting and I don't care if they got the Bob off I wouldn't care if they buck naked right this as plain as I can be don't make fun of their shouting right why because if it is the Holy Ghost on them as only an anointing it's still the Holy Ghost oh yes it is amen I don't make fun of these preachers or anything out there or in the message or anything I ain't going to make fun of nobody in their ways you tell me God told you something say Amen brother I just don't agree with it but whatever God told you go with it I don't agree with it I'm not making lot of you that's right don't make fun of nobody kids don't do it you remember what the brother was bringing out Wednesday the kids went out there and they made fun of them PE of oh Elisha what was it it's called Mom and Daddy was making fun of them right don't do it them kids will come out and say the same thing you're say and they'll say it in the open when you don't want it say it right right and then you slap them in the mouth for saying it may I call that a hypocrite or what else going to use but look he says a Christian cannot sin let's see makes mistakes we sin daily I have to look my notes I want these two together I get it in here somewhere oh excuse me they don't have it back there I was wondering why I couldn't find this is questions and answers reached in 1959 he says you be forgiven but to blaspheming the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven people say BL blaspheming the Holy Ghost what is blaspheming mean means to talk about ridicu make fun of blaspheme so you make fun you make light of somebody and what's your problem it can wind up and lose you a lot of things but we're going to get down in a minute if we have time where it to blaspheme the Holy Ghost is to turn down the truth all right go to number 12 remember the one we gave the prophet said it's impossible for a Christian to blaspheme right go to number 12 and let's read this one taken from 54 6:20 in the evening I heard someone the other day trying to preach the blaspheming of the Holy Ghost he said a Christian couldn't blaspheme the Holy Ghost and I and I and turned around evidently the gu was doing and read Hebrews 6 I thought oh brother he was once made enlightened and made partakers of the Holy Ghost to fall away and to renew himself again under repentance sure he can blaspheme the Holy Ghost Jesus said they that had blasphemed the Holy Ghost because they said he has a devil and he says now they can blaspheme the Holy Ghost sure he can blashe the Holy Ghost now which one's right is it the Christian cannot blaspheme or is it you can blashe now which one's right well if he didn't correct it we got to go with like sister said both of them but to do with both of them we got to have a little understanding right and that's going to take some self interpreting without a quote if I bring you to microphone you're going to self interpret without a quote because it's not a quote take my word for it run it in the computer I say brother Bren was right in both places amen but it's what he's talking about one he's talking about a true Christian cannot blaspheme two this guy has not made it yet see all right made partakers of the Holy Ghost that's Hebrews 6 to fall away to renew he said that that's a borderline believer right absolutely a borderline believer is not a true born again Christian that's right am but yet we can call them Christians because we just say Christians a true Born Again believer a Christian cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost but yet he can have a lot of problems a lot of troubles now you going to tell me that when you heard this message you didn't first say it's wrong right when you first heard it you said it's wrong well not did God say blaspheme the Holy Ghost that's what we think he'd say but Paul said causing them to blaspheme he said but I've done it in ignorance see in ignorance you and I turned down the word when we first heard it is that true oh of course I accepted everything brother around said right when I you lying hypocrite that's right you're blind as a bat and that's the greatest unbelief could be right I like the way sister Gail says I come in fighting right now there was things brother around said and I believe yeah but there was things he said that went haywire to my previous understanding you know what if ID have stayed with that I would have proved that I was a borderline believer right but by going on and later saying Lord I'm sorry that brother first told me and sister told me about the word of the Lord at this hour and the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ something like that I didn't agree with it I said Lord It's been made known to me now and I pray that you just help me to not do that again to blaspheme to reject truth when truth is presented to you then your ears are sealed you'll turn away from God very religious right seal of Christ form of godliness but deny the power thereof you turn away reject truth look back at number 11 un content for the faith you mean to tell me only onethird of you will believe he asked them did they believe and you have no doubt in your mind and raise your hand he's asking them you know do you believe in being in the form of the Holy Ghost and do again through you and I the things that he did here on Earth look you mean to tell me only onethird of you believe what's left for you to do but to condemn it condemned then be condemned then you mean if the Lord Jesus himself how could you ever be forgiven let me say one word what is the unpardonable sin to reject truth when it's presented to you is that right now was that our point last Sunday that we were trying to make a point out of it and the worst sin of all to me is the people of this message that do not believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that was why I gave you the illustration the prophet was saying it the other night you believe in the one God you believe in the water baptism you believe in this you believe in the no Eternal Health you believe in all this and then one little thing comes I don't believe that that's unbelief right well I never heard it like that well when you hear it that's it don't turn it down that's right his brother random would say he said remember now every word is a seed and he says when you're eating that cherry pie and you come to the seed says you don't throw the pie away said you turn you you throw the seed away then he goes what he said but be careful because remember it is a seed amen what is the unpardonable sin sure to blasing the Holy Ghost to doubt Hebrews 138 as being the same in every way except the Corporal body of Jesus Christ I didn't make that statement go read it you become an unbeliever when you don't believe he's the son today I don't care who's taught it to you who said it big man in this message he said third pulled only for brother brandham and the Lord Jesus Christ well probably a million people following the man's thoughts you think you're going to convert one of them from what he said no no you think the dead raised is going to convert one of them for from what he saying no the holy spirit is the only one that can convert anybody brother de why don't you preach like these other preachers preach why show me what their preaching has done but I will show you what the preaching of the seals of Daniel 70 weeks the vials the plagues the marriage and divorce I'll show you a church that's right and I'll put you against any church in this message we got a lot of fults and failures right but I'll put you against it yes sir the preaching of the truth is the only thing that's going to save any of us and if we don't know the truth then we're blindly ignorant a lot of times you know we do it willfully so don't tell me about it and I won't be responsible you don't ADM you you're guilty right sister Gail she tells me too much she told dick one day said don't tell me no more no abouton we responsible she right there she it admitted that something had touched her about it and she just didn't want to know no more because you'd have to deal with it all right so then what is sin unbelief what's the thing that God cannot forgive sin to doubt Hebrews 138 as to be the same today as it was when the prophet was alive or to be the same as it was when Jesus was alive for you to doubt Hebrews 13:8 today because of your unbelief then that's the worst unbelief that there is remember now listen to what I'm saying unbelief is the only thing God cannot forgive right I mean he can forgive anything but he can't forgive unbelief why because you won't believe him that's right is that simple enough you won't believe him so he can't forgive you at least we should pray Lord I believe everything I think that I've heard but just don't let me turn down truth just because somebody goes against brother Dale I don't throw that away I take it home and I think about it and I study it and I ask God God don't let me be wrong because I've got a church following I've got a family my wife my kids my grandkids great grandkids is here they're depending upon me don't let me disbelieve your word amen but see we can't wait I've tried to explain the Ministries and things you can't do it I had a thought to bring this afternoon and I've been thinking on it for a week or two and you know and I started finally getting it down to the point I thought Lord there's a one quote I need because I believe it but I want them to read what you said through your Prophet so they'll believe that he said it anyway and I said I want one scripture you say well my Lord you can find it in the scripture just run it in the Bible you can't if you got it you run it in wrong you type it in that computer wrong it ain't going to come out right now you might take the word and and type it in there and it'll be 5,842 and you got a long search but that was serious I sat in the study for quite a while and uh I thought Lord I know he said this this and I know the Bible says this but I used every quote I could ever thought I could find it wasn't there well you know what most ministers would get so haywired on that until you just about go out and blow your brains out because you know you got it but you don't know what to do I thought there ain't no need of me sitting here I'm going to go do something I went out and told my wife I said I'm going to ride over to the building look at some deer stands and see what we need to do well I came back didn't get it well Lord I know it's there but I can't find it so you going to have to find it for me I went on and done something else and rambled around done everything I could I don't mean wrong I mean I just went out and you know go there was no need of me trying to frustrate my own self sat back down and there it came the quote I needed and the scripture I needed some three or 4 hours later than where I started thinking on it as a point of trying to find it and you know yourself I can run a pretty good search in this message so you know I ran every Avenue that I could find but my point is one thing if we'll just let him lead us he won't lead us into as we read to start with the world heill lead us into righteousness he'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever is said exactly right and teach you things to come because he put it together for you like I said when I ran across that where he said unpardonable sin to blaspheming the Holy Ghost it's impossible for a Christian to say I didn't stop with that and say I got it I said let's see what else he said and you hear he saying that it look like a Christian can sin well we got something we got to deal with now Lord what's your answer you see I'm trying to give him the honor and glory for the whole thing because of one thing because you and I ain't nothing but just a bunch of mess that's right we're no different than any other church or any other system right right the people of this message is becoming the biggest cult that there's ever been MH but in that there's a bride Amen in that there is a bride and you know what she's got to come out of that amen right come on brothers let's stand think on these things the unpardonable sin blaspheming the Holy Ghost yeah what is blaspheming the Holy Ghost saying that that's not the Lord that's right and they was not in no way against the healing of the Lord Jesus right right there was in no way against the signs and the Wonders that he performed right but when he begin to say I and my father are one right Lord Jesus now you run that quote in you'll find a prophet saying this when the bride begins to say I my father's one and these other things Satan's going to come after well I think it's time to get in or get out we had to something happened years ago I thought about it many many times we had a little problem and I prayed and prayed for the Lord to take care of that problem but it just didn't seem to work out that he won't take care of it I'm honest it it just didn't work out and I kept on I said Lord now you know then that I'm as serious as I can be you're going to have to work something out I came out here and I made an announcement I said we've got a naken in the camp and I said the only thing I know to do is pray for God to take the achin out I'm not against anybody everybody thinks I am they think I'm a weird old charact no I love everybody but I said we got an aan lord well you know what it wouldn't maybe two weeks till aen left I didn't want nobody to leave but a can left you see Church we're we're down at the end of it the worst sin of all is for us to try to hang around and pity patter a little bit around this message and you know oh just love one another we just we just love one another everybody's supposed to love one another may I quote that again we just to love one another we believe in one God we believe in one a baptism we believe in this we believe in that we believe in all of the things we believe that outside even the Corporal body is the only thing that he's not Hebrews 138 but we don't believe he heals today like he used to that's unbelief we ought to say at least as far as I'm concerned no if he ain't the same you and I got problems well I just don't see it I I see more out there than we do here I want the Bible go ahead brother what we got 27 in the spiral book 217 anybody have a need I believe he's a Healer I believe he's a savor he Hebrews 138 I first came in this message you know what they told me we left the Baptist in' 67 you know what they told me that I couldn't be saved because all salvation was over with in 63 some of you never did face stuff like that but we were told you couldn't be saved cuz Redemption was over in 63 I said listen according to my Bible Redemption was over before the world ever begun and I said you're lying God the prophet say you are and I said one reason Reon that I know you're Li is because he saved me so everybody make you a liar because he save me why don't you put your life on the line sometime tell people what you believe what God can you don't you heard our sister she's got a burden about the sister of Our Lord we just ask you to come on the scene work it out work it out for your honor and Glory CU we we would try to do it and we do it wrong Lord but yet you know how to work everything out so you come on the S in Jesus name amen his mother so let's just agree with him Lord Jesus we believe you that whatever is needful to take care of things that

willing to follow whatever that would needful and the best attitude in the right way we love you father and we thank you in Jesus name Hallelujah anybody else what God sing it unto him as you go your
