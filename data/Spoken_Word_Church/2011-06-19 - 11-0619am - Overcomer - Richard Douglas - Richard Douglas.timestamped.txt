[23:57] this morning
[23:58] songs called the master of the sea
[24:02] one night upon the sea a ship was
[24:07] tossing to and fro
[24:10] Breakers dashed on every hand
[24:15] angry winds around it blows that's right
[24:18] all on board were filled with
[24:22] fries as the mighty Billows road then
[24:29] they called upon the one
[24:32] through the winds and Waste Control
[24:35] that's right
[24:37] when he reaches out his
[24:40] hands
[24:43] Bill OC set his command
[24:56] s
[25:00] what man is
[25:35] calm life
[25:45] throws upon like she's day
[26:02] the master of
[26:08] Ross which is how
[26:12] we'll see
[26:23] you'll see this has surgery
[26:28] what man is this they all the same
[26:47] way
[27:01] games away
[27:36] oh my what a mighty God no matter what
[27:39] trouble or what trial we go through we
[27:42] know that we have the master of the sea

[28:11] appreciate that one of his prayers you
[28:13] know God's A Healer right he works in
[28:15] mysterious ways
[28:17] and he definitely gave me a the
[28:19] understanding of how much we need one
[28:21] another because when one part of the
[28:24] body suffers the whole body suffers so
[28:27] we should come together in the unity and
[28:29] whatever someone else is going through
[28:31] we'll be able to take it in prayer and

[28:37] so right we're thankful that God's
[28:39] always mindful of those things in our
[28:40] life

[28:44] thought that a little give me I'm just a
[28:47] simple man I just have five smooth
[28:49] stones and just a small slingshot but it
[28:54] seems to get the job done with the off
[28:57] with when God operates the right
[28:59] operates the sling and everything else
[29:01] right that's it comes in place man
[29:03] appreciate it really damn brother Wayne
[29:05] he's appreciate blood now he's taking us
[29:07] out last night and showing us such great
[29:09] Fellowship him and his wife yeah I
[29:11] appreciate it every one of you like when
[29:14] you turn women to the book of Saint Luke
[29:16] chapter 4.
[29:19] I'd like to read
[29:21] small passages of scripture this morning
[29:26] I still love the Lord amen amen I love
[29:29] him so much I can never say enough about
[29:31] how good he's been to me he's he's been
[29:33] so good with all this going and on with
[29:36] endless testimonies of his arrest
[29:39] I like this part right here
[29:42] St Luke chapter 4 verse one going down
[29:45] through to verse 14.
[29:48] and Jesus I like this being full of the
[29:52] Holy Ghost
[29:53] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[29:57] spirit Into the Wilderness
[29:59] being 40 days tempted of the devil not
[30:02] just any amen but Satan himself right
[30:05] and in those days he had eaten nothing
[30:08] and when they were ended he afterward
[30:12] hunger
[30:13] and the devil said unto him if thou be
[30:16] the Son of God command this Stone Let It
[30:19] Be Made bread
[30:21] and Jesus answered him saying it is
[30:24] written that man shall not live my bread
[30:27] alone but by every word of God
[30:30] and the devil taking him up into a high
[30:33] mountain
[30:34] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[30:37] in the moment of a Time
[30:40] and the devil said unto him all this
[30:43] power will I give thee and the glory of
[30:47] them
[30:48] for that is delivered unto me and to
[30:51] whomever whomsoever I will give it if
[30:55] thou therefore will worship me all shall
[30:59] be thine
[31:01] and Jesus answered and said unto him get
[31:04] thee behind me Satan for it is written
[31:07] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[31:10] him only shalt thou serve
[31:13] and he brought him to Jerusalem and sent
[31:15] him on the Pinnacle of the temple and
[31:17] said unto him if thou be the Son of God
[31:20] cast thyself down from hence
[31:24] for it is written he shall give his
[31:26] angels charge over thee to keep thee and
[31:30] in their hands they shall bear thee at
[31:33] least at any time thou Dash thy foot
[31:35] against the stone
[31:37] and Jesus answered and said unto him it
[31:40] is said
[31:41] Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God
[31:43] and when the devil had entered ended all
[31:46] the Temptation he departed from him for
[31:49] a season and Jesus returned in the power
[31:54] of the spirit into Galilee and went out
[31:57] of Fame of him throughout all the region
[32:00] around the Bible

[32:39] back door to the pulpit father we want
[32:42] an outpouring of your Holy Spirit upon

[32:48] righteousness now father we want to be
[32:50] filled father and we claim it this

[33:07] father I pray major needs of everyone
[33:09] here father May the power of the god

[33:30] father we're thankful this morning for
[33:32] your grace and mercy and father as many
[33:35] churches father around this area this
[33:37] morning have beckoned you to come and
[33:39] invited your father but father your
[33:41] little bride wants your welcome here
[33:43] this morning Jesus you're welcome here
[33:45] this morning you can do whatever you
[33:47] want to do to us Lord father whatever

[33:59] willing way father for we ask it in
[34:01] Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you
[34:04] may be seated amen oh my I like what it
[34:07] says right here it says let me it Jesus
[34:09] it seemed like when Jesus after he just
[34:12] come from right here he just went down
[34:14] to the water brother Wade and he'd just
[34:16] been baptized John had baptized the Lamb
[34:18] of God Behold the Lamb of God which
[34:20] taketh away to sin the world here he
[34:22] goes down for the washing of the lamb
[34:25] and you would think he would have
[34:26] probably went right into his ministry
[34:27] right then but it said in Jesus being
[34:30] full of the Holy Ghost returned from
[34:33] Jordan and was led by the spirit Into
[34:36] the Wilderness I think a lot of times
[34:37] the spirit the spirit of God leads us
[34:40] into these things that we might be
[34:42] Overcomers like Jesus was here because
[34:44] he didn't give us he just didn't hand us
[34:47] a picnic basket this morning he ended as
[34:49] a sword and a shield in the armor of God
[34:51] he put us right into battle this morning
[34:54] and we want to talk about this morning
[34:55] Overcomers we only talk about the things
[34:58] that Jesus showed that he would overcome
[35:01] all right man so we'll overcome also
[35:03] it's just being 40 days tempted of the
[35:07] devil not because he demon but Satan
[35:10] himself come to challenge Our God right
[35:13] amen amen and the word of God will
[35:16] defeat Satan Anytime Anyplace anywhere
[35:20] under any condition
[35:24] right now he says in the devil said unto
[35:26] him Son of God command this tone Let It
[35:31] Be Made bread
[35:32] however he didn't know that is the god
[35:35] that our God was not a God that had to
[35:38] depend upon natural elements the first
[35:41] thing we we have to do the first thing
[35:43] we have to overcome is just flesh yeah
[35:46] don't come this flesh and right here he
[35:48] was showing you how to defeat the
[35:50] advertisement of the flesh is to prayer
[35:54] and pasting
[35:56] and Satan coming his weakest moment you
[35:58] know when a man is hungry he'll steal
[36:01] kill and destroy to get the food in his
[36:03] body amen but Jesus was showing here
[36:06] that man shall not live by bread alone
[36:09] but by every word
[36:12] she is out in the mouth of God right on
[36:14] this morning that's what we live on in
[36:16] every word of God we see this Satan come
[36:19] with this major assault to attack our
[36:22] Lord but when he defeated him he took
[36:26] him right back to the word of God every
[36:27] time right here's Satan comes again with
[36:31] this great assault the second time
[36:34] trying to get Jesus to put on a show for
[36:38] you all right but a lot of times Satan
[36:40] hotels with you is really a son or
[36:42] daughter got you to do this or you'd
[36:44] have done that you disproved yourself
[36:46] all right we have nothing to prove the
[36:48] words already prove themselves amen

[42:47] scripture he manipulates words he'll
[42:51] quote the message to you
[42:53] he'll misplace it right right yeah
[42:57] misinterpreted
[43:00] but the word of God I'm glad that the
[43:02] prophet made it so simple and the Bible
[43:04] says it's so simple the word of God was
[43:06] that is without right interpretation he
[43:10] don't take none of the big theologians
[43:11] around the message he don't take another
[43:13] great preachers around the message right
[43:15] all it takes is a heart Desiring to
[43:18] understand God and God said I will send
[43:21] you the comforter and he will lead you
[43:24] in God that's right I'm so thankful for
[43:27] that Comfort this morning I'm thankful

[44:05] right
[44:06] see that's true the Bible said that God
[44:09] encamps angels around those who fear and
[44:12] love him right Jake was used in the
[44:15] scripture but he was displacing it
[44:18] trying to make him respond the wrong way
[44:21] the same way he does to me and you right
[44:23] right A lot of times we sit in services
[44:27] and somebody will say something that we
[44:29] that a lot of times that we maybe not
[44:31] the way that the pastor says or maybe

[45:03] present himself and tries to get you to
[45:06] come to him then he is not a man of God
[45:09] a true man of God will always point you
[45:11] to Jesus Christ under any circumstance I
[45:14] mean in any situation at any time right
[45:17] he'll point you to the word of God all

[51:41] Wade when God gives a man a revelation
[51:45] that's right but when a man gets his own
[51:48] Revelations
[51:51] right it humbles me that God would show
[51:54] us these times
[51:56] and give us the equipment to defeat the
[51:59] Devil right on his own ground this is
[52:02] his right now right but we're going to
[52:04] overcome right by the word of Our
[52:06] Testimony and the blood of the Lamb all

[52:35] alive there's either truth or a slide
[52:38] it's either it's in the word of God or
[52:41] Satan's life
[52:43] he didn't say what the word says or
[52:46] you're saying are you lying that's right
[52:48] it's that plain Paul said about preach

[54:25] see what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[54:27] let him baptize in the name of the
[54:28] Father the Son the Holy Ghost
[54:30] because that's what Jesus said
[54:33] that's what they always say that's what
[54:34] Jesus said
[54:36] I said but the apostles went out with
[54:39] the commission and knew exactly because
[54:41] they had Revelation they knew exactly
[54:43] what he meant that's right amen I said

[55:06] didn't Jesus say
[55:08] father I thank you
[55:10] that is me and you the one yep I pray
[55:13] that they'll be one right amen
[55:16] God we gotta become one with the word
[55:20] one with the word amen one with the
[55:24] message amen and here's Satan's trying
[55:27] to attack on the word here's what he
[55:30] tries to do to defeat us he wants to
[55:32] overcome us but he can't if we're
[55:34] standing on the work the only reason he
[55:36] was defeated because she stepped out
[55:37] this word is a protection it's a barrier
[55:40] it's a fortification it's a city of
[55:43] refugees amen that your rights can run
[55:46] in that ceiling come on let me find
[55:48] blame Glory come on oh my God and David
[55:51] said blessed is the man who God won't
[55:54] even saying to me you want him
[56:00] because it's not minding your
[56:02] righteousness it's the very
[56:04] righteousness of God Amen
[56:07] Prophet God tells us three musts we must
[56:09] not do yeah misinterpret the word
[56:13] he says for illustration it means well I
[56:16] believe it means this
[56:18] but the word says it means just what it
[56:19] says God don't
[56:22] clamorable words like me and he'll he
[56:23] don't he don't mince rise right right
[56:26] that's why he said let you yay be yeah
[56:29] he says don't misplace the word see
[56:32] Satan is trying to get us either to
[56:34] misinterpret misplace it or must not
[56:37] dislocate the word right do misplace the
[56:41] word right every scripture and the Bible
[56:44] has the same application
[56:47] you have to set it in this place right
[56:49] amen and the only way you accept those
[56:51] debate and the only way God is going to
[56:53] set those scriptures in place and guess
[56:54] the devil was because he was the word oh
[56:57] yeah the only way we can set Satan in
[56:58] his place is we got to become the
[57:00] worship
[57:03] dislocate the word to dislocate the word
[57:07] or mislocate it
[57:10] got it to be it's got to be in the right
[57:13] time the right place
[57:16] at the right moment s man we cannot take
[57:18] Luther's message and take a Rapture
[57:21] exactly it's good and we cannot take
[57:23] away from Luther's message neither can
[57:26] we add two
[57:27] losers neither can we add two Wesley's
[57:30] message neither can we take away from it
[57:33] we have a three step two yeah we have
[57:36] three sets we had to be just the case of
[57:39] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:41] and then the Holy Ghost himself right
[57:43] has come
[57:46] when the Holy Ghost yourself come he
[57:48] leads us and God Amen that's right
[57:51] he's the one a lot of people say oh well
[57:54] that was when brother said those things
[57:56] that was for back then oh my the Bible
[58:00] tells me
[58:01] that in the book of in the Book of
[58:04] Malachi he says I am the Lord thy God
[58:06] and I changed not all right neither does
[58:09] his his word changed that's right right
[58:11] I'm gonna say wait a minute now my
[58:13] brother said that I was just and people
[58:15] say oh this is we gotta have a new age
[58:17] gosh oh my God but the Bible tells me
[58:20] and you to be weary of that he said be
[58:24] not conformed to this world but be he
[58:27] transformed by the renewing of your
[58:32] let this mind that was in Christ being
[58:34] used amen we got to think like God right
[58:37] we gotta talk like God we got to live
[58:39] like God we gotta walk like God right
[58:42] and then Satan
[58:44] has no power else right right you don't
[58:46] say he can't tempt us didn't say
[58:48] couldn't temperature say we wouldn't
[58:49] have trials but we'll overcome amen amen
[58:51] will overcome
[58:54] you want to get help from overcome I
[58:56] like what Jesus said in Saint John

[59:02] always like the word the word is true I
[59:05] mean we can't we can't have we can't say
[59:07] that but when the word just says it's
[59:09] true right we might misinterpret it we
[59:11] might miss pronounce it or say something
[59:13] one time but this word when you read it

[59:23] have peace right

[59:47] whole world Lose Yourself what have you
[59:48] got he said that in me

[1:02:04] world to come to up your heart right you
[1:02:07] know what I think a lot of times when we
[1:02:09] come to church is what I promise is
[1:02:11] because Jesus said in the Beatitudes it
[1:02:14] just I've read this over and over and
[1:02:16] it's the simple little things maybe you
[1:02:17] call it and maybe but I was reading that
[1:02:20] he said blessed blessed are the pure in
[1:02:24] heart but they shall see God we
[1:02:26] shouldn't come to any service and not
[1:02:28] see God all right I say God when we get
[1:02:30] void here we should be Prince of God
[1:02:32] purify my heart and I might seek God
[1:02:35] manifested in each and every one of us
[1:02:37] all right amen right
[1:02:40] oh I like about this oh Rabbi I once
[1:02:43] said he was a teacher teaching these
[1:02:44] young children he said he said how can
[1:02:48] you tell
[1:02:49] when the darkness is moving away the
[1:02:51] light is approaching he says that it's
[1:02:54] because that you can see the difference
[1:02:55] between a sheep and a dog in the
[1:02:58] distance
[1:02:58] and the class looked at him with him but
[1:03:00] he said he said no it's not
[1:03:03] it's not it's not it
[1:03:04] he said well is it that when the light
[1:03:07] is coming to the darkness is moving away
[1:03:09] that you can tell the difference between
[1:03:10] a peach tree and a fig tree
[1:03:14] yes that's it he said no that's not last
[1:03:17] night and they said well what is it
[1:03:19] he said the way you can tell that the
[1:03:22] light has removed the darkness is is
[1:03:24] when you can look
[1:03:26] and any man or any woman's face yeah and
[1:03:31] see your brother and sister oh man now
[1:03:34] that's when the darkness is gone and we

[1:11:25] churches I don't mind so I thought well

[1:12:09] way amen love yeah love tell me all

[1:12:15] him right let me get open that scripture
[1:12:17] and that scripture just fell that power
[1:12:20] just fell up I said show me and it
[1:12:21] wasn't me he took over right he said he
[1:12:24] said I should show the one priest in the
[1:12:26] Bible that was there with a woman that
[1:12:28] handled the fire of God
[1:12:30] I said show me one apostle that was a
[1:12:33] woman that was there because she said
[1:12:34] what about Mary Magdalene went to the
[1:12:36] party I said she went and told
[1:12:38] she never preached what about Phillips
[1:12:41] daughters I said they prophesied she
[1:12:43] said don't prophesy me preach I said she
[1:12:46] prophesied I said look at Timothy it
[1:12:48] says the Bible Paul told us that I
[1:12:51] worship not a woman to preach or teach
[1:12:53] or have authority over the man but to be
[1:12:55] silent
[1:12:57] exactly it's hard things I can feel it
[1:12:59] boiling the demon was getting mad
[1:13:02] so am I but look at this she said what
[1:13:04] about addiction this
[1:13:06] I didn't know these things brother don't
[1:13:07] I didn't know these things
[1:13:09] he said then ask her how can she be the
[1:13:12] husband of one wife all right
[1:13:16] ask the woman how can she be the husband
[1:13:19] of one wife
[1:13:22] man happening at that time the Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost she said what you are you're
[1:13:25] a male shoving this pig all right
[1:13:30] so I'm sorry you feel that way and the
[1:13:32] love of God was only so strong oh my God
[1:13:34] you know what I'm gonna need because she
[1:13:36] said here talking to myself I don't even
[1:13:37] talk to you no more when you speak to
[1:13:40] you no more I can't believe you believe
[1:13:41] stuff like that

[1:13:54] to jump off a cliff you can fly would
[1:13:58] you do it
[1:13:59] he said no I wouldn't I said well he
[1:14:02] tells you to disbelieve the word of God
[1:14:04] you're doing the same thing especially

[1:14:15] didn't get mad the Lord said man I'm
[1:14:18] spear for their life right because it's
[1:14:21] a dangerous thing that's right he
[1:14:23] challenged the word of God Amen remember
[1:14:25] what happened to Satan when he
[1:14:26] challenged him the spirit of the Lord
[1:14:29] moved on me brother Aaron

[1:18:26] I want to talk about that Throne just
[1:18:28] for a minute oh the overcoming strong
[1:18:32] Revelations 3 21 he said to him that
[1:18:35] overcometh well I grant you set with me
[1:18:38] in my Throne all right thank you Jesus
[1:18:42] even as I also overcome and I'm sat down
[1:18:45] with my father in history
[1:18:48] what an opportunity that we we us the
[1:18:53] iPhone the outcasts of the world will
[1:18:55] set with the King yeah right he said now
[1:19:00] what are we to overcome he said that's
[1:19:03] the normal question to ask here that's a
[1:19:05] normal question oh I appreciate the
[1:19:08] simplest of the world don't you he said
[1:19:10] but it's not the actual thought of this
[1:19:12] verse
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:15] for it is not so much what we are to
[1:19:19] overcome yeah but how we ought to
[1:19:21] overcome
[1:19:22] now this is a logical now this is
[1:19:25] logical for does it matter what we are
[1:19:28] to overcome as long as we know how we
[1:19:31] can overcast oh my there's a difference
[1:19:33] see when a Fighter fights a fight if he
[1:19:35] knows how to defeat that upon he's
[1:19:37] studied him he'll know what he can what
[1:19:39] punch you can't take and what punch you
[1:19:40] can't take right you know if he can't
[1:19:42] take the body blows see he said a quick
[1:19:46] look at the scriptures
[1:19:47] which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming
[1:19:51] will bring out the truth of this
[1:19:53] proposition
[1:19:55] in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of
[1:19:57] the devil he overcame the personal
[1:19:59] Temptations of Satan by the word and by
[1:20:03] the word only
[1:20:04] in each of the three major trials
[1:20:07] that corresponded flesh
[1:20:11] unless they said corresponded exactly to
[1:20:13] the temptation
[1:20:15] of the Garden of Eden he said the lust
[1:20:19] of the he said the lust of the flesh
[1:20:22] the lust of the eye the pride of life
[1:20:25] Jesus overcome by the word eve fail
[1:20:30] to the person of Temptation Of Satan by
[1:20:33] failing to use the word right
[1:20:36] right he said in Adam fell in indirect
[1:20:39] indirect Disobedience to the word but
[1:20:43] Jesus overcame by the word and right now
[1:20:46] let me say that this is the only way
[1:20:48] to being overcomer
[1:20:51] also is the only way that you can know
[1:20:55] if you're overcoming
[1:20:57] because that word Can't Fail right oh my
[1:21:02] heaven exactly that's why that word has
[1:21:04] to be in like David said he still have a
[1:21:05] hidden thou word in my heart and I said
[1:21:08] nothing because he knew David's flesh
[1:21:10] would pass away all those things but he
[1:21:12] knew that word of God about it forever
[1:21:15] he said now notice again Jesus overcame
[1:21:17] the three World Systems of religion
[1:21:20] we're going to overcome overcome three
[1:21:21] World Systems in relationship how will
[1:21:23] you overcome by the word exactly
[1:21:26] people say well I wait till the program
[1:21:28] and I get serious
[1:21:31] yeah
[1:21:32] it's a dangerous thing right you might
[1:21:35] find yourself hunting for all right
[1:21:38] because outside in the door locked right
[1:21:40] yeah it says in he said when we
[1:21:43] repeatedly when he was repeatedly
[1:21:46] badgered by the theologians of this day
[1:21:48] we got a lot of theolograms around the
[1:21:49] message imagine the truth you stand on
[1:21:53] the truth or not very well like fella
[1:21:55] but that's all right I don't mind being
[1:21:57] Jesus's Oddball I like being called
[1:21:59] Jesus's donkey yeah that's right amen he
[1:22:03] said he constantly applied the word he
[1:22:07] spoke only what the father gave him to
[1:22:09] speak oh my that's where we get in
[1:22:10] trouble right he said he only spoke what
[1:22:13] the father do right yep
[1:22:16] he says there was not a Time
[1:22:19] when the world was not utterly confused
[1:22:22] by his wisdom oh yeah see this message
[1:22:24] confuses people but God's Not the Only
[1:22:27] confusion but of life eternal amen
[1:22:31] he said
[1:22:33] for the wisdom
[1:22:35] wisdom he said confused was not really
[1:22:38] confused by his wisdom for it was the
[1:22:41] wisdom of God when is not the wisdom of
[1:22:43] God confounded the wise and the Prudence
[1:22:47] right he said in his own personal life
[1:22:49] contending with himself Jesus contending
[1:22:51] with himself his flesh
[1:22:53] he overcame by obedience
[1:22:56] to the word of God
[1:22:58] he said in Hebrews 5 7 it says
[1:23:01] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:23:05] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:23:06] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:23:09] that was able to save him from death
[1:23:13] that's what's going to save us from
[1:23:15] death amen and the same thing that saved
[1:23:17] him
[1:23:18] and was heard and that he feared
[1:23:23] Jesus feet and be feared oh my because
[1:23:27] no man every man always feared death
[1:23:30] because he didn't know what to expect
[1:23:32] he said he feared though he were a son
[1:23:36] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:23:38] which he suffered and being made perfect
[1:23:42] will even not be made perfect through
[1:23:44] our sufferings and our trials
[1:23:46] if we don't have no trials and suffering
[1:23:48] you know what character
[1:23:50] character is not a gift it's a victory
[1:23:52] all right
[1:23:55] he said he became the author of Eternal
[1:23:59] salvation unto all them how will he
[1:24:02] become the author of Eternal salvation
[1:24:03] of Me and You by us following the word
[1:24:07] and obeying everywhere
[1:24:09] he was obedient to
[1:24:12] the word he said now then there's not
[1:24:15] one person
[1:24:17] I like this part by the deal I know
[1:24:18] you've read it many times it's just now
[1:24:21] then there will not be one person who
[1:24:22] will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:25] Christ unless he has been living that
[1:24:28] word right right back and you say just
[1:24:30] hearing that right amen he said living
[1:24:33] that word amen
[1:24:34] he said your prayers boy this is
[1:24:36] powerful by the way your prayers your
[1:24:39] fastings your repentances no matter what
[1:24:42] you present to God none of that will
[1:24:44] gain you the privilege of sitting in
[1:24:46] that Throne it will be granted only
[1:24:52] as the Throne of the king is shared by
[1:24:54] the queen because she is United to him
[1:24:57] United here right yeah
[1:25:00] he said so only they who are of that
[1:25:04] word even as he is of that word we'll
[1:25:07] share that Throne he said remember we
[1:25:10] have shown clearly All Through the Ages
[1:25:13] ages that even
[1:25:15] and fail because they met the word so
[1:25:19] the Ephesian age fell by turning
[1:25:21] slightly from the word he said until
[1:25:24] with every age continue to turn
[1:25:27] we have final repetition of the word by
[1:25:31] the World Council Church systems this
[1:25:34] layout of seeing age ends in the
[1:25:36] blackout of the word thereby causing the
[1:25:39] departure of the Lord from yes the only
[1:25:42] age that departure of the Lord has ever
[1:25:45] left in the midst of this this the
[1:25:47] church happens right oh my not the
[1:25:49] pardon from us right but from the church
[1:25:51] world he says he stands outside calling
[1:25:55] to his own who follow him by obedience
[1:25:57] to the word after a short and Powerful
[1:26:00] demonstration of the spirit this little
[1:26:02] Hunted hunted right
[1:26:05] persecuted group will go to be with
[1:26:10] Jesus yes sir amen that's the only way
