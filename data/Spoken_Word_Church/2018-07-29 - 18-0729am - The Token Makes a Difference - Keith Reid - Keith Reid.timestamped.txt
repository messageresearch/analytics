[12:39] praise you and we give you all honor and
[12:41] glory in Jesus name we pray amen and
[12:45] amen in the book of Exodus chapter 11
[12:49] let me read verse 4 and the Lord gave
[12:54] the people favor in the sight of Egypt
[12:58] of the Egyptians moreover the man Moses
[13:02] was very great in the land of Egypt in
[13:05] the sight of Pharaoh servant and in the
[13:07] sight of the people and Moses said thus
[13:11] saith the Lord about midnight will I go
[13:14] out into the midst of Egypt and all the
[13:18] firstborn of of the land of Egypt shall
[13:21] die from the firstborn of Pharaohs
[13:24] Pharaoh that sitteth upon the throne
[13:26] even unto the firstborn of the
[13:29] maidservant that is behind the mill and
[13:31] all the firstborn of beasts
[13:34] and there shall be a great cry
[13:36] throughout all the land of Egypt such as
[13:40] there was none like it nor shall be like
[13:43] it any more but against any of the
[13:46] children of Israel shall not a dog move
[13:51] his stone against man or beasts and he
[13:56] may know though that the Lord hath put a
[13:59] difference between the Egyptians and
[14:02] Israel may the Lord that is blessing to
[14:05] the reading of the word you may be
[14:07] seated you know this was actually the
[14:12] time of the the first Exodus God was
[14:17] moving his people out of Egypt imagine
[14:21] after 400 years of crying out praying
[14:25] being enslaved down there in Egypt but
[14:29] God had sent this man Moses and we look
[14:34] at it in the natural 40 years before
[14:36] this would have been better in our minds
[14:39] that Moses should lead them out but he
[14:43] was filled with the Egyptians theology
[14:46] and God sent him for 40 more years bring
[14:49] him back known in Egypt leaning on a
[14:51] stick and said go tell Pharaoh let my
[14:53] people go
[14:55] hallelujah amen you know Moses he come
[14:58] back to Egypt and all the the miracles
[15:01] and all of that really and I'd like to
[15:03] speak this morning on the token is the
[15:07] difference the token is a difference
[15:10] because here it is that him and God that
[15:13] the Bible says that God actually
[15:15] hardened Pharaoh's heart in other words
[15:19] if if fira wanted to do it hey men you
[15:23] know that there was something in fear or
[15:25] that let him say no you can go but keep
[15:29] leave the animal lead the women and
[15:32] children he wouldn't give up but there
[15:35] was one last thing that God was going to
[15:37] do in Egypt he was going to cause a not
[15:41] just darkness but he learned to strike
[15:44] the firstborn but before that happened
[15:47] God begin to tell them now he said no
[15:50] take a lamb a lamb for a house and
[15:54] you're gonna keep it for 14 days and the
[15:58] 14 day you're gonna kill it at Eveland
[16:01] time and he begin to tell them exactly
[16:03] how they're going to do it no this was
[16:07] the first Exodus amen and if we are in
[16:12] the third Exodus we can look back at the
[16:15] first section of see what it was like
[16:18] and know exactly what God is doing today
[16:21] amen hallelujah him and now you know the
[16:26] Bible said that him and they had a
[16:28] prophet I've indicated prophet him he
[16:33] came with signs and wonders before them
[16:36] him in this Nicollet established that
[16:38] him and his word was a Word of God that
[16:42] there was nothing that he said that
[16:44] would not come to pass in other words I
[16:47] can say hey me like brother Branham said
[16:50] in 1964 question-answer he said they had
[16:53] perfect interpretation of the word we
[16:57] divine vindication that is what God gave
[17:02] them so there was not a doubt in their
[17:04] mind whether this is a word of God or
[17:07] not whatever Moses said I mean they
[17:10] couldn't rest assure that this is a word
[17:13] of God because God bring it to pass amen
[17:18] hallelujah amen on an evening time him
[17:22] does it kill the Slama him and they take
[17:25] the blood him that put it on the lintel
[17:27] now when they kill the lamb it wasn't
[17:31] the insider they put it it was an
[17:34] outsider I mean the blood was to be seen
[17:37] from the outside he's arrived
[17:40] so everybody passing the outer they men
[17:43] know that there is something about this
[17:46] house it is identified because the blood
[17:50] is on the lintel and on the doorpost but
[17:54] not only doctor on the inside something
[17:57] was happening came in they had two rows
[18:01] the lamb with fire hey man that's a
[18:04] heated Janissa how you there with me no
[18:07] I'd like to also say that him in the 14
[18:11] days of the keeping that lamb you know
[18:15] their tents earning the Lamb that they
[18:17] chose when a HOSA take a lamb there to
[18:21] examine it why because the lamb had to
[18:25] be perfect in their sight and can I say
[18:29] like this if the sacrifice was not
[18:33] perfect then the worshiper could not be
[18:36] perfected so you had to examine your
[18:40] sacrifice they mentally clear your
[18:43] sacrifice worthy know when the sacrifice
[18:47] was worthy amen hallelujah then the
[18:50] worship law can be accepted isn't that
[18:54] the same today
[18:55] Damon our sacrifice' is worthy and if
[18:59] he's not worthy a man then your praise
[19:02] Damon cannot be accepted but if he's
[19:05] worthy then you're worthy hallelujah
[19:11] glory here
[19:14] Halloween is him and God now said him
[19:18] and there shall be a great cry prote all
[19:22] the land of Egypt he meant such as there
[19:25] was a nun like it nor shall be like it
[19:30] anymore he's doing a new thing now he
[19:33] said but against any of the children of
[19:36] Israel shall not a dog move his tongue
[19:40] hello somebody Haman God said now listen
[19:45] don't be afraid when you walk out don't
[19:48] be afraid when you take the sex in us
[19:51] this is no longer you Haman this is me
[19:55] not even a dog he's gonna bark after you
[19:59] Haman because God said it that way what
[20:02] was God doing he was building confidence
[20:05] in his people
[20:07] this was not very Exodus this is God
[20:10] Exodus
[20:11] I'm gonna move you out hallelujah
[20:14] I like that amen another dog movie
[20:18] strong against man or Pisa and he may
[20:22] know how that the Lord put a difference
[20:26] between the Egyptians and Israel
[20:30] do you know God put a difference between
[20:33] the church and the bride between the
[20:36] world and the church there is a
[20:38] difference even God put that difference
[20:42] him Allah we're gonna line this first
[20:45] section also with the third Exodus Amen
[20:50] hallelujah but if we look at it in there
[20:54] in the light of the turn Exodus and
[20:57] we're gonna look at some things really I
[20:59] mean that God was really doing among
[21:02] them him and because he wasn't it was
[21:06] just kill a lamb and put it there no
[21:10] hallelujah in the in the message Tolkien
[21:13] Peres 17 he said in that Tolkien or the
[21:18] blood hallelujah in the time of Egypt
[21:22] coming out there Exodus ah if that
[21:25] Tolkien was not unless all the supreme
[21:28] sign the Tolkien was not no good unless
[21:33] that Tolkien was displayed the Tolkien
[21:37] had to be displayed not a simple tosser
[21:41] payment with a token but that token must
[21:44] be applied hallelujah he said no matter
[21:48] how much anyone could prove that he was
[21:51] a true and the government adju him ma ma
[21:56] my circumcision that didn't do anything
[21:59] about it all they took the token not a
[22:03] covenant hallelujah he never said when I
[22:06] see the covenant sign when I see the
[22:09] token so today and so in the Prophet
[22:15] 1963 Haman September said so today Damon
[22:21] this is now 2018 hallelujah
[22:25] we say so today
[22:28] the bride of Jesus Christ came in with
[22:31] perfect interpretation can take that
[22:35] word that was spoken that vana and then
[22:38] bring it present tense today that's the
[22:42] power of the word of God having in the
[22:44] amount of the believer today is around
[22:48] you said oh it's already spoken but it
[22:52] was there waiting on you to come to your
[22:55] position hallelujah you might be a
[22:59] professed Christian is talking to you
[23:01] now you might be a covenant the covenant
[23:05] with crossa but unless the token is
[23:08] display in this late hour we're coming
[23:13] all hallelujah amen Issa we're coming
[23:15] now
[23:16] amen there is no way for him to pass
[23:19] over the token must be displayed it must
[23:23] be on the remembrance you could have
[23:27] come up and said I'll take you men aside
[23:31] I believe that to be the truth
[23:33] I believe Moses a prophet I believe the
[23:36] pillar of fire that's guiding him I
[23:38] believe that your whole yeah Amen
[23:41] witness all of it but he said believe
[23:43] all the word all the message but yet say
[23:47] now I'm just as well off you because
[23:51] I'll never serve you if he didn't have
[23:55] the blood coming in the night of the
[23:58] Passover hallelujah he died just the
[24:03] same so today we can say oh I love the
[24:09] prophet I love the message of the hour
[24:13] hallelujah hey man I believe the message
[24:17] amen that's all right that's in the
[24:20] right direction but there's something
[24:23] more that is required is very may indeed
[24:27] not just at church now but individually
[24:31] there's gotta be something there
[24:34] we believe unitedly I love my posture I
[24:38] love my church that Sorata but
[24:41] individually Damon where are you
[24:44] standing hallelujah and you have to be
[24:48] born a Jew hallelujah had to be
[24:52] circumcised but he said more than that
[24:56] it was a state of emergency it was a
[25:00] time of desperation
[25:02] it was the time like any other time no
[25:06] sir
[25:07] Haman it was a serious thing why because
[25:11] the life of the first born hallelujah
[25:16] if it wasn't right or in the message
[25:19] desperation brother branham said if
[25:21] firstborn son would have come out and
[25:24] look again and said daddy remember I'm
[25:28] your firstborn are you sure that you did
[25:33] exactly what the Prophet said hallelujah
[25:37] not your mind now no what you think are
[25:42] you sure you've done exactly what the
[25:45] Prophet said and today the people ought
[25:49] to say pastor are you sure remember
[25:53] you're staying right with the Word of
[25:55] God amen that is not your idea
[25:58] they me you not project yourself it is
[26:01] not your life and Hashanah but is
[26:03] exactly what the Prophet said your
[26:06] establish us in the word because many
[26:10] people today I've got their own ideas
[26:12] then they've got their own Carriere
[26:15] but we want the Word of God because
[26:18] there's gotta be something to take us
[26:20] out of here are you sure are you sure
[26:25] [Applause]
[26:27] hallelujah glory to God why was this why
[26:34] is it so required you you see amen
[26:39] you see when that lamb was killed
[26:42] hallelujah the prophet said the lamb was
[26:46] only a symbol it was a substitute er
[26:50] that is not really what God wanted but
[26:54] it wasn't time yet and he was holding
[26:56] that substitute for a time he's wrong
[27:00] because he said the life of the animal

[36:23] trying to do in this Exodus he's trying
[36:27] to discredit him in what you've gotten
[36:30] this hour and so many churches today in
[36:34] the message they are taking down the
[36:37] cloud because some skeptics say he
[36:41] wasn't in the mountain that day but I
[36:45] tell you it is saying so many people
[36:49] don't know where they're standing
[36:51] [Music]
[36:53] Ezra so they're taking down the cloud
[36:57] and put it in a corner because somebody
[37:00] don't believe it what do you believe

[37:07] thing that they have is a run we've got

[37:33] is done today or what people around the
[37:36] message of done you you said those who
[37:39] feel that they've got some education I
[37:42] tell you your kitchen is a two-edged
[37:44] sword and getting into epistemology
[37:50] which is the study of all truth and they
[37:53] said the only way can be proven it can
[37:58] be right or me truth it's got to be
[38:01] proven and so they're taking things from
[38:05] the message and try to prove it
[38:08] by education and when they come up with
[38:12] a 0 they said we don't believe that
[38:15] hey listen somebody God is not known by
[38:20] Haiti okay son God is known by
[38:23] revelation of this word hallelujah amen
[38:30] so they tried to take dates and time
[38:34] hello somebody and match it with his
[38:37] word let me see where the Prophet was
[38:41] brethren God never call you to
[38:44] understand it all he called you to
[38:47] believe I take you back to the to the
[38:55] Lazarus when Jesus came to Bethany
[38:58] Marta said master if you are here my
[39:02] brother would not have died but even now
[39:05] whatever you ask the Lord he will do it
[39:08] even now jesus said your brother will
[39:13] rise again you know what she did she
[39:16] didn't believe that she changed her
[39:18] timing I know he will rise but not now
[39:22] in the resurrection in the last day
[39:26] that's what the people are doing they're
[39:29] taking the promise of God that is for
[39:31] now and they're putting it in another
[39:33] day
[39:34] they tell you I know I believe but I
[39:37] believe it's over there there ah Jesus a
[39:43] woman don't you know I am the
[39:47] resurrection I am the life I am he
[39:51] thought you are dead yet shall he live
[39:54] and whosoever liveth I believe this vow
[39:59] this and I believe us now this because
[40:05] they're gonna believe this
[40:07] this is that amen
[40:14] but that I tried to prove these things
[40:16] by science you know and I never like
[40:21] research in school because I said all
[40:25] the professor's are confused
[40:27] everybody's got another way to put it
[40:29] and everybody cross a line over somebody
[40:33] else's work and they said well this is
[40:35] the way you ought to do it hello they're
[40:38] all confused but my God's not confused
[40:41] amen hallelujah so watch what what the
[40:46] devil is doing so he's taking out those
[40:49] five things that was in the fight first
[40:51] Exodus out of the turn Exodus and if you
[40:55] take those things out then Jesus Christ
[40:58] is not the same yesterday today and
[41:00] forever and if he's not the same where
[41:05] is your fate Ezra I'm not called to
[41:11] prove it I'm called to believe it Ezra
[41:17] that's the problem with the world today
[41:20] somebody's at all I can't believe it
[41:23] unless I can prove it
[41:27] Ezra
[41:28] hallelujah so they're taking out the
[41:31] cloud amen
[41:33] and so when they take out the cloud they
[41:36] said well you know we don't even believe
[41:38] the pillar of fire amen
[41:41] then they believe for a while but then
[41:43] they change
[41:45] is awry brother branham said how can
[41:48] they believe when they've got nothing to
[41:51] believe with man because if you're never
[41:56] seen of God you can't believe the Word
[41:58] of God for your day hello your call
[42:01] under another dispensation under another
[42:05] anointing but the braddock rasa that

[42:52] name in the Old Testament they had to
[42:55] put their answer upon their sacrifice ah
[42:58] and I get invited to come on with their
[43:00] sacrifice but if the sacrifice not
[43:04] worthy then their worship ratata worthy

[1:01:24] is real Haman the Tolkien must be be
[1:01:27] displayed a jewel Haman could furnish
[1:01:31] pair of 75 could furnish the evidence

[1:04:05] core spirit among us because of where we
[1:04:08] are but brethren no one day said this is
[1:04:12] the most deceiving age that there will
[1:04:16] be people will feel that they are and
