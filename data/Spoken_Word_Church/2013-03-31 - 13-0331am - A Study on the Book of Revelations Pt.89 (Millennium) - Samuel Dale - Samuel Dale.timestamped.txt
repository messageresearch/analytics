[6:35] her there
[6:36] and just lord let everything be okay we
[6:39] love you and we thank you in jesus name
[6:41] amen revelations one
[6:48] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[6:50] gave unto him to show into his servants
[6:52] things
[6:52] which must shortly come to pass and he
[6:55] sinned and signified it by his angel and
[6:57] to his servant john
[6:59] who by record of the word of god and the
[7:01] testimony of jesus christ
[7:03] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[7:06] he that readeth and they that hear the
[7:07] words of this prophecy
[7:09] and keep those things which are written
[7:10] therein for the time
[7:13] is at hand now let's go to revelations
[7:17] 20 we read the first seven verses
[7:22] and i saw an angel come down from heaven
[7:24] having the key of the bottomless pit
[7:26] and a great chain in his hand he laid
[7:29] hold on the dragon that old serpent
[7:31] which is the devil and satan
[7:33] and bound him a thousand years and cast
[7:36] him into a
[7:37] bottomless pit and shut him up and set a
[7:39] seal upon him
[7:41] that he should not deceive the nations
[7:42] no more until the thousand years should
[7:44] be
[7:45] fulfilled and after that
[7:48] he must be loosed a little season and i
[7:51] saw thrones and they that set up on them
[7:53] and judgment was given
[7:54] to them now this is not i'll emphasize
[7:57] here
[7:58] this is not to watch on judgment this is
[8:01] the millennium
[8:02] that we're coming up to and when you get
[8:03] on over in the chapter you'll find the
[8:05] white throne judgment all right
[8:07] and i saw thrones and they that set up
[8:09] on the end of judgment was given them to
[8:10] them and i saw the souls of
[8:13] them that were beheaded for the witness
[8:15] of jesus
[8:16] and for the word of god and which had
[8:18] worshipped the beast
[8:20] which had not worshipped the beast
[8:23] neither his
[8:24] image neither had received his mark upon
[8:27] their foreheads or in their hands and
[8:29] they lived and reigned with christ a
[8:31] thousand years
[8:32] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[8:35] until the thousand years was finished
[8:37] this is the first resurrection
[8:40] blessed is blessed and holy is he that
[8:43] have part
[8:44] in the first resurrection on such the
[8:46] second death have no
[8:48] power but they shall be priests of god
[8:50] and of christ and shall reign with him
[8:52] a thousand years and when the thousand
[8:54] years were expired
[8:56] satan shall be loosed out of his
[8:59] prison he may be seated the lord that is
[9:02] blessing to the reading of the word
[9:04] now we've been studying for quite a
[9:07] while
[9:09] in the book of revelations and
[9:13] reaching to this position uh i'm
[9:16] trying today to take a couple of
[9:18] messages that will be
[9:20] basically relating to the uh
[9:24] easter time which we call the
[9:26] resurrection time
[9:28] and in that you know uh
[9:33] the resurrection of 2000 years ago
[9:36] was a wonderful opportunity a wonderful
[9:39] thing to happen
[9:41] to where that mankind you know could uh
[9:44] receive the new birth to life and be
[9:46] raised out of his
[9:49] things of life and beings but
[9:53] if we don't have a resurrection today
[9:55] amen you know
[9:57] being raised paul wanted to be
[10:01] part of an out you remember there in the
[10:04] scripture
[10:05] and see brought around explaining that
[10:07] it's not
[10:08] that he didn't believe in the
[10:10] resurrection he believed in it and he
[10:12] had experienced it by the new birth
[10:14] but he wanted an out resurrection out
[10:16] from among
[10:17] ideas and thoughts of mankind
[10:20] or you know denominationalisms or
[10:22] whatever you want to call it for our day
[10:24] we'll see that's what we need we need an
[10:27] out resurrection we
[10:29] we cherish and think about the
[10:31] resurrection back there
[10:33] but if that resurrection is not real
[10:35] here as we'll pick up this afternoon
[10:38] on the first resurrection and talking
[10:41] about it
[10:42] if if that's not still going on then
[10:46] we've got a problem
[10:47] we've stopped somewhere we've
[10:49] denominated we've died
[10:51] whatever you want to call it uh but uh
[10:54] i was at one i'll reach a little while
[10:56] the prophet said i'm a firm believer in
[10:58] the millennial reign
[11:00] but see if there hadn't been a
[11:01] resurrection
[11:05] there would never have been a millennial
[11:07] right see
[11:08] it's all hinged upon the resurrection
[11:11] everything is life
[11:13] all of it whatever we are is hinged upon
[11:16] the resurrection
[11:18] all right and then being on to that part
[11:21] we need to
[11:22] think more about it and we will this
[11:23] afternoon get back onto the thought
[11:26] but we've been for quite a while now in
[11:29] the book of revelations taking it
[11:31] slowly step by step going through the
[11:33] things
[11:34] and basically what we've been covering
[11:37] from chapter four
[11:38] upward uh would be after the
[11:42] rapture because the bride goes up in
[11:44] chapter four we know that
[11:46] and then you know we we look at all of
[11:49] those things
[11:50] and we see them the tribulation period
[11:52] was set in upon israel
[11:54] and while they're at their tribulation
[11:56] period and having that
[11:57] uh by the two witnesses then the bride
[12:00] will be in glory because she's been
[12:03] done taking a rapture she'll be at the
[12:04] wedding of the
[12:06] of the lamb and she'll be being married
[12:09] to christ
[12:10] not that we're not married to him now we
[12:12] are by the new birth
[12:14] that's wonderful but we are going to a
[12:16] wedding in the sky
[12:18] and then a marriage suffer after that
[12:21] wedding
[12:22] and all of that is to take well that's
[12:23] taking place the earth is being
[12:26] uh purged in a form of
[12:30] tribulation falling upon it and then
[12:32] we'll wind up into armageddon
[12:34] and getting ready and seeing those
[12:37] things so all of these things that we've
[12:39] been talking about are future events
[12:42] but we see what it has to do with us
[12:46] you know here in our day in times and
[12:48] what we're looking at it
[12:49] and and seeing then that the bride of
[12:52] jesus christ according to revelations 19
[12:54] that we've been there
[12:56] it says and his wife has made herself
[12:58] ready
[12:59] well that's what's taking place now
[13:02] is not going on over there you know and
[13:05] some were being made ready because
[13:07] the the actual bride of christ is not
[13:09] seen anymore after
[13:11] revelation on earth let me put it that
[13:13] way
[13:14] they're not seen in an earthly scene
[13:17] after chapter four going to go up in a
[13:19] rapture
[13:19] now we're seeing in chapter five right
[13:23] you know they're and and recognized as
[13:25] priests and kings and
[13:26] and things like that but that's still
[13:29] that's not that's a heavenly scene
[13:31] and that's what's taking place while the
[13:34] earth is getting its purging and
[13:36] and everything and getting ready for the
[13:37] millennial rain right
[13:40] and then the bride has made herself her
[13:42] wife has made herself ready
[13:44] and then we covered then covering on up
[13:47] the last couple of messages
[13:49] how that in revelations 19 that we would
[13:52] see the bridegroom
[13:54] and the bride come riding back together
[13:57] into the millennial reign all right and
[14:00] the millennium is
[14:01] the prophet said paragraph 495 of the
[14:04] future home
[14:05] he said it's it's a honeymoon right
[14:09] we don't come back here to to uh do
[14:12] as a lot of people today we come back
[14:14] here on a honeymoon
[14:16] all right and that honeymoon there can
[14:17] be a lot of things taking place
[14:19] but it's a honeymoon for the for the
[14:22] bride and the groom
[14:23] you know to have some time together
[14:26] to hear but to have something that they
[14:29] can do
[14:30] and they're going to live a thousand
[14:31] years all right
[14:33] all right here on earth but remember
[14:35] we'll be in glorified bodies so it won't
[14:37] matter about the time elements to us
[14:40] you know once we go up in a rapture or
[14:43] you know we're going to be eternal body
[14:45] spirit soul
[14:46] so it won't be a a point of the
[14:48] millennium that we're coming back you
[14:50] know to some form of an earthly
[14:52] something
[14:53] as mortal people now but they will be
[14:57] people here that will be in the mortal
[15:00] realms
[15:01] and things but it will not be the bride
[15:04] because when she goes up in a rapture
[15:07] she just doesn't come back to a natural
[15:09] point she comes back in a supernatural
[15:12] to rule and reign with him for a
[15:15] thousand years
[15:16] all right now in the religious world
[15:19] system
[15:20] there is what's called about the
[15:21] millennium because the millennium will
[15:23] read the minute and go through it
[15:25] it means a thousand all right then you
[15:27] can say millennials
[15:29] and some say that that's what it means
[15:31] there but millennials means thousands
[15:34] but you know we're only going to deal
[15:36] with what we know about the
[15:38] 1000 years because that's what the
[15:41] scripture was reading
[15:42] but there is what's called
[15:44] post-millennium
[15:46] pre-millennium some people believe
[15:49] that back during the catholicism of the
[15:52] ages especially
[15:54] in the the catholic church ruled and
[15:57] reigned for over a thousand years
[15:59] and that's why they come up with a
[16:01] pre-millennial
[16:03] in other words they were having their
[16:04] millennium and they were picking up the
[16:07] tights and the shadows from
[16:09] uh like uh solomon david you know
[16:13] back in their time that there was a
[16:15] thousand years through there that there
[16:16] was a
[16:17] uh a kind of a a utopia
[16:20] on the earth that uh that they didn't
[16:22] have any battles they didn't have any
[16:24] things going on you know and they picked
[16:27] that up and they brought it up and
[16:28] brought it in and said well we're
[16:30] already in the millennium
[16:32] well it's kind of odd some of the
[16:33] believers in the message kind of picked
[16:35] that idea up now and wanted to know
[16:37] asked brother branham somebody didn't
[16:39] said where was the millennium at so we
[16:40] heard it was down here under the
[16:42] under the bridge of jeffersonville we'll
[16:44] see you had the argument of a
[16:46] pre-millennial
[16:49] post-millennial you know one being
[16:51] before
[16:52] meaning it's already transpired and
[16:55] that's the catholic doctrine
[16:57] all right and some are looking forward
[16:59] to the millennium
[17:00] well i i don't think the bride was back
[17:03] there in the dark ages being killed that
[17:05] that was a millennial ring to you
[17:07] i i'm looking forward to a millennium a
[17:11] thousand years
[17:12] to be on earth that i don't have to
[17:16] worry about
[17:16] any problems and people are teaching in
[17:19] the message some now
[17:20] that we're already in the millennium
[17:23] well if this is the millennium
[17:25] i'd sure miss my understanding of the
[17:27] bible right
[17:28] you know i mean i i'm still
[17:32] getting older and and uh you know and
[17:35] um people are having to go to work and
[17:39] slave and do and if this is the
[17:42] millennium i don't know
[17:44] i i don't know whether i'd want anything
[17:46] else
[17:47] you know what i mean no that might be
[17:49] worse
[17:51] no this is pretty bad with the sickness
[17:53] and the heart acts and trouble
[17:54] i always thought in the millennium but
[17:56] that satan as we read there would be
[17:58] bound a thousand years
[18:01] that was my understanding of reading the
[18:03] bible that's what
[18:05] that would be wouldn't have to be
[18:06] interpreted that would be
[18:08] self-explanatory
[18:09] that you could read that he would be
[18:11] bound
[18:13] you know for a thousand years and
[18:16] and it would be a a peaceful time well
[18:19] like i said this is peaceful i sure
[18:22] wouldn't
[18:23] i want something better than this
[18:25] somewhere down the road don't you
[18:28] but that's the way people believe it and
[18:30] that's their thoughts because you're
[18:31] gonna have that
[18:32] as i said just like you got the the
[18:34] pre-millennium you've got millennials
[18:36] and you've got the
[18:37] post-millennials and you've got all kind
[18:40] of all millennials and everything in the
[18:41] world you know
[18:43] that goes on in man's ideas because he
[18:45] just reads something
[18:47] and he tries to put it together well
[18:49] remember that you're reading something
[18:51] that will transpire after you're here
[18:56] you know even in chapter four we see we
[18:59] went up
[19:01] all right then these other things would
[19:02] be happening to israel
[19:04] all right then we come on over in our
[19:06] understandings
[19:07] and we come riding back in revelations
[19:10] 19
[19:11] the king of kings and lord of lords
[19:14] there this past wednesday trying to
[19:15] to bring a little talk on it you know
[19:18] that
[19:19] when you come to that position
[19:22] you see all of it in bold capital
[19:24] letters
[19:27] and that's the 1909 edition of scofield
[19:30] okay i'll make sure to put that because
[19:31] a lot of people said my bible don't say
[19:33] these things
[19:35] you know because a lot of bibles don't
[19:36] put emphasis upon the wording they're
[19:39] just
[19:40] writing the book but some do in the 1909
[19:43] version of the scofield
[19:45] it does it and the 1611 does it i
[19:48] checked both of them
[19:50] and you say i've got a 16-11 scofield
[19:53] bible well
[19:55] i would advise you to go look
[19:58] i've got a king james version
[20:02] the king james version was in 1611.
[20:06] but the scofield bible only come out
[20:09] about 1909
[20:10] somewhere right in there with the
[20:12] beginning of doing that
[20:14] but yet that's where people you know
[20:15] they'll argue with you and they'll tell
[20:16] you
[20:17] but they don't even look and think about
[20:20] i want you to think that's one reason
[20:21] i'm going through the book of revelation
[20:24] i want you to look at the bible and read
[20:26] it for yourself
[20:28] but you have to have an understanding
[20:30] from that
[20:31] of the things that will take place even
[20:34] after we get out of here
[20:36] and gone you know these things will be
[20:38] transpiring and then we see ourselves
[20:41] that's it in chapter 5 in a heavenly
[20:43] scene
[20:44] but then we don't see ourselves until
[20:46] you come over about the 19th chapter
[20:49] and then you can see the wife is getting
[20:51] married and everything taking place
[20:53] and then we come riding back into the
[20:54] millennium on a honeymoon
[20:56] well that's where we pick back up to see
[20:58] our park the other part
[21:00] is to israel and i told you the amazing
[21:03] part of it is
[21:04] all that you read in there and all the
[21:06] preaching i've been going through
[21:08] it's only a three and a half year period
[21:09] of tribulation you know plus whatever
[21:11] happens to israel
[21:13] because there is an extension and going
[21:15] on into the
[21:16] daniel 70 weeks but now
[21:19] think about it so we read here that
[21:23] they'll
[21:24] be a thousand years
[21:29] a thousand years now you think about it
[21:34] a thousand years
[21:39] of perfect peace
[21:42] now this will come to pass
[21:45] because of the resurrection
[21:50] on easter morning now
[21:54] there won't be anybody in the millennium
[21:57] other than the gospel to the heathen and
[21:59] what that is you'll have to go to your
[22:01] prophet
[22:02] he says he'll be there but
[22:05] you know all else will be in
[22:10] eternity won't be having to deal with
[22:14] you know earthly elements we'll get to
[22:17] it in a minute where that we can rule
[22:18] and ring with him
[22:19] and the ruling ring means you gotta have
[22:20] something to rule over so then god is
[22:23] going to
[22:24] do those things and some of that i can't
[22:25] explain and won't try to
[22:27] but we believe it but see why
[22:31] is there going to be a thousand years
[22:37] why is there going to be a millennial
[22:39] rhyme
[22:41] all right you can argue the post in the
[22:43] freeze but people don't
[22:45] they didn't talk about why there's to be
[22:47] one
[22:50] why is there to be a thousand years
[22:53] of perfect peace of earthly time now now
[22:56] it will be 360 days to the year
[22:59] because it will throw the year back the
[23:00] world will fall back into perfect order
[23:03] and it won't be like we are now 365 in
[23:06] the fourth and things
[23:08] but still it'll be a thousand years
[23:11] that somebody's going to live
[23:15] on earth well like i said a moment ago
[23:18] then what are we worried about for
[23:19] because we're eternal beings that's
[23:22] right
[23:22] and we won't be times we won't be uh
[23:25] people of time
[23:27] we won't be that we'll we'll be
[23:30] creatures of eternity
[23:32] so what will it matter to us
[23:35] about the thousand years it won't
[23:38] because
[23:38] we won't even having to be worried about
[23:40] it we'll be actually sitting in the
[23:43] stage when we reach there
[23:45] until when the scripture actually says
[23:46] that that in
[23:48] with the lord a thousand years is how
[23:50] long
[23:51] in one day
[23:55] i mean you take two days ago
[23:59] he was being raised as far as he's
[24:02] concerned
[24:03] well when we come to that position
[24:04] that's all it'll be with us
[24:07] it will make no difference about time we
[24:10] won't having to be
[24:11] well well i gotta go eat i've got to go
[24:13] i've got to do you know
[24:15] it won't be that but to somebody it will
[24:22] to somebody it will
[24:25] be a thousand years that's right
[24:28] all right we read it in a minute to do
[24:30] what to prove
[24:32] the sin curse was gone
[24:35] right that's why the reason for the
[24:37] millennium that's why the thousand years
[24:39] is to show the sin curse is gone but
[24:42] once man failed
[24:43] see that nobody's ever lived a thousand
[24:45] years upon the earth
[24:47] methuselah was 969.
[24:50] now that was the closest time coming to
[24:53] a thousand years but he never made it
[24:55] why because the bible says the day you
[24:57] eat thereof
[24:58] that day you shall die all right
[25:02] let's see that's what missed eva because
[25:04] she still had the carnality
[25:06] she ate took whatever you want to call
[25:08] it
[25:10] and she thought 24 hours later but i
[25:11] didn't die
[25:14] because she was thinking about natural
[25:17] days
[25:18] he was thinking about a thousand years
[25:20] of the day and a day of the thousand
[25:21] years
[25:22] when he said today you eat thereof that
[25:24] day you die
[25:26] see then the bible self-explanatory if
[25:28] we just read it
[25:31] that's why i want you to read the book
[25:32] of revelation for yourself see we were
[25:34] told to stay out of it
[25:36] you know we couldn't understand it but
[25:38] why not
[25:40] i mean is there any problem with 1 000
[25:42] years
[25:44] i mean you know there's any problem with
[25:46] reading that
[25:47] is there any problem with understanding
[25:49] the different things that we've read
[25:52] it's just bringing it down to simplicity
[25:56] and to see ourselves and to see where we
[26:00] are that's why i tried to take
[26:01] everything in each message at least
[26:04] somewhere in that message
[26:06] try to bring something that relates to
[26:08] you and i now
[26:10] yes right now brother said
[26:13] jesus had the millennium in him yes
[26:18] well he said why did he have the
[26:20] millennium in him
[26:22] because he was the millennium we get
[26:25] this evening he was the resurrection
[26:26] wasn't he
[26:30] he didn't just have the resurrection he
[26:32] was the resurrect
[26:33] he didn't say i've been in the
[26:34] resurrection he said i am the
[26:36] resurrection right
[26:39] but it's going to be interesting when we
[26:41] get down here to find out that the
[26:42] millennium is a
[26:45] first resurrection
[26:48] so we just read in the scriptures but we
[26:50] didn't emphasize that point
[26:53] not then we'll have to get down in to
[26:54] understand when now
[26:56] so think about it we're going to live a
[27:00] thousand years
[27:05] somebody on this earth is going to live
[27:07] one thousand years
[27:09] ago and that is the promise
[27:12] throughout the world the types and the
[27:15] shadows that are said of david solomon
[27:17] and them
[27:18] and their times of peace
[27:21] all of those things mean things to us
[27:27] god worked six thousand years
[27:30] now that it took him six thousand years
[27:32] you could call it a day because
[27:34] he calls it a day which you can take
[27:36] that day that it's called make it a
[27:37] thousand years
[27:39] because what does it matter to an
[27:40] eternal person it's just a statement
[27:44] this is defining what happened on day
[27:46] one day two day three four five six
[27:49] that's all it's doing it's just
[27:50] explaining you know explaining the
[27:53] the creation
[27:56] see then he worked six thousand years or
[27:58] worked six days
[28:01] and he rested the seventh
[28:08] but see nobody ever finished that
[28:09] seventh in the natural right
[28:13] even metusa but remember methuselah came
[28:15] along after the fall
[28:18] so just remember what i'm trying to say
[28:21] see god worked 6 000 years you realize
[28:26] that as far as god is concerned
[28:30] he just got too creative
[28:35] he's not worried about time and doing he
[28:37] just got too creative
[28:38] that's right because he's eternal
[28:43] and see then doing it you don't realize
[28:45] we fell in the rest
[28:48] right we failed in that day
[28:52] it wasn't that today was completed then
[28:54] we failed right
[28:56] no we fell in that rest that he was
[28:58] resting not because he was tired
[29:04] but eternal god doesn't tire but he just
[29:06] done that as a type
[29:09] we'll get two more some of the things
[29:10] this afternoon but as a type
[29:14] all right in doing that then
[29:18] in his rest satan sneaked in
[29:23] and began to pervert
[29:26] so that day wasn't finished
[29:30] man never finished that day of rest in
[29:32] the
[29:34] that part back there see then when he
[29:36] comes over into the creation or the life
[29:39] the fall
[29:40] he surely has never finished a thousand
[29:43] years living
[29:44] but this will make 969.
[29:47] but somebody's going to live a thousand
[29:49] years
[29:51] he said well why do we need that for
[29:52] because god said we would
[29:54] amen you don't want to go
[29:59] you wouldn't like to be on earth a
[30:01] thousand years with
[30:03] no devil
[30:06] i think there's something wrong with you
[30:08] all right amen
[30:10] i mean we'll get a straight jacket and
[30:12] send you somewhere
[30:14] if you wouldn't want it a thousand years
[30:16] on earth
[30:18] and it ain't kind of like the uh who is
[30:20] it
[30:22] i won't say cause like i can't get in my
[30:24] mind but anyhow they believe that we're
[30:26] going to be discord along here today and
[30:29] and all at once god comes and we just go
[30:32] right on doing what we're doing
[30:37] we're just going doing what we're doing
[30:40] and we'll be building cars we'll we'll
[30:42] just go around on building cars
[30:44] but we just reached a happy time
[30:47] but being mad you'll be happy
[30:50] well that's their ideas of it what's
[30:52] your idea
[30:53] i still don't think i'd be too good of a
[30:55] utopia do you
[30:59] he said why would god spend all of the
[31:01] times going through
[31:03] types and shadows and and things to show
[31:09] of why a millennium will have to come
[31:12] he said well we know see because we do
[31:14] we know we've heard the prophet
[31:16] we've heard the prophets say that you
[31:17] know we're going to live a thousand
[31:19] years because
[31:22] the sin curse is gone
[31:25] that's fine but now
[31:28] a thousand years
[31:34] then that seventh day back there
[31:39] when he rested
[31:42] it was never completed or finished
[31:47] because the fall came so it interrupted
[31:52] god's 1000 years it was going to be
[31:56] yes was it okay
[32:00] go ahead but one day i'll come back
[32:04] and we'll have a thousand years to prove
[32:09] the sin curse is gone
[32:13] now wouldn't that be something to be
[32:14] able to live a thousand years without
[32:16] the devil
[32:18] but see remember it's the millennium is
[32:21] the seventh day that
[32:22] there is a type of the millennium
[32:25] to come all right see then as i said and
[32:29] i'll try to run through it in a hurry
[32:30] without taking a lot of
[32:32] time but we know down through the old
[32:33] testament they worked six days and
[32:35] rested to seven
[32:38] you still have the people called a
[32:40] seventh day adventist
[32:42] i think we know that they still have
[32:45] then they have their saturday
[32:47] because that is the seventh day of the
[32:50] week
[32:51] we believe in raising the first day of
[32:52] the week and ongoing but still
[32:55] if you'll understand what i mean in the
[32:56] old testament they would work six years
[32:59] and they would risk the sabbath
[33:00] they would work six days and they would
[33:02] rest a sabbath what about a whole year
[33:05] to just take off from work you know and
[33:08] let the land lay and just
[33:10] live but remember in the sixth year you
[33:13] had to
[33:13] work a little extra because you store a
[33:15] bunch
[33:17] but just think about all of those types
[33:19] of shadows out in the old testament that
[33:21] you read about
[33:24] of them was pointing to a time
[33:30] all of those seventh day
[33:33] speaking off was pointing to a time
[33:39] but you said well it was pointing to
[33:40] jesus christ we're amen we believe that
[33:43] but get the point
[33:47] the seventh day back there as a rest day
[33:50] could only pop
[33:52] the baptism of the holy ghost jesus said
[33:55] come unto me all year labor and heavy
[33:56] lady now i'll give you rest
[33:58] because remember that came on the eighth
[34:00] day
[34:03] the holy ghost never came on the seventh
[34:05] day
[34:07] because see if it had come on the
[34:08] seventh day it would have been finished
[34:11] are you listening you know i'm just
[34:14] putting in a few points just for you to
[34:15] think you know
[34:19] and the holy ghost fell on the seventh
[34:20] day see then that would have completed
[34:22] the rest
[34:25] and paul wouldn't be right when he said
[34:27] he spoke of another day you know
[34:31] but see that seventh day was a type of
[34:34] the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:36] because of the rest that you go into
[34:39] from your own labors
[34:41] but it would really type in the
[34:42] millennial reign
[34:47] because you're still going to be in time
[34:49] in the millennium
[34:52] you hear people saying it and i wonder
[34:54] what they're thinking i don't know what
[34:56] brother rubble said
[34:57] he said the lady of cnn ages ended
[35:02] but now what's he meaning time didn't
[35:05] quit
[35:09] right right time goes on into the
[35:12] millennium
[35:13] that's right because it's a thousand
[35:16] years
[35:19] so you got to listen to what he's saying
[35:21] what's what's he talking about
[35:26] the age cease when the bride is called
[35:28] out
[35:30] but it's to the bride that's right
[35:34] right it's it's not to the world that's
[35:37] right
[35:38] right now see if you're born again
[35:40] christian
[35:41] you're not in the age you're physically
[35:44] humanly living in the age
[35:46] right but by the baptism with the holy
[35:48] ghost you're called out of that into the
[35:50] eighth day by the baptism with the holy
[35:52] ghost
[35:53] no they say physically that won't happen
[35:56] until the future home
[36:00] see when it falls over there come back
[36:01] into a night
[36:03] understand what i'm saying so the end of
[36:06] the millennial reign
[36:08] is to show you
[36:12] that satan is not in control
[36:18] but if we don't have the new birth
[36:21] that takes our soul into the eighth day
[36:23] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[36:25] not our physical body i keep saying that
[36:27] because there's a doctrine of that
[36:28] ideology
[36:30] people saying years ago said we're
[36:31] already in the eighth day
[36:33] well we're already the next day you
[36:34] didn't pass the millennium
[36:36] but the millennium was the seven right
[36:39] does that mean you're already in the
[36:40] future home
[36:41] well like i said well ago if if this is
[36:43] the millennium i've done missed it
[36:45] and certainly if this is the future home
[36:47] i've i've missed it all
[36:49] yeah i mean
[36:52] i thought by that time the devil not
[36:55] only to be bound but by the future home
[36:57] he's supposed to be annihilated
[36:59] all right but just getting some things
[37:01] to think about not to just say we're
[37:03] millennials people
[37:04] that believe this but why do we believe
[37:07] it
[37:09] why do we believe in the millennial
[37:10] reign
[37:14] but just remember now the bride
[37:17] is eternal body spirit and soul in that
[37:20] millennial reign
[37:23] so it really don't matter but it's just
[37:25] a statement or phrase and i like the way
[37:28] the prophet said that
[37:29] he said it's a honeymoon
[37:32] you know he comes after the wedding and
[37:36] the wedding supper and everything and
[37:38] all
[37:38] and then we come back for a honeymoon
[37:43] a special time
[37:46] to be on a honeymoon
[37:49] now if you like we was we couldn't
[37:51] afford a whole lot of it so
[37:53] our honeymoon was one night in a motel
[37:55] and that was all we could afford
[37:57] and i couldn't hardly afford adapt but
[38:00] you know
[38:01] but still it was a honeymoon right
[38:05] there there was a time away from mama
[38:06] and daddy and they couldn't come
[38:08] and knock on the door because the second
[38:10] night we spent
[38:11] at my mother mother-in-law and
[38:13] dad-in-law's house
[38:14] well we was kind of subject to their
[38:16] rules and regulations but we did our one
[38:18] day
[38:19] you know one night as a honeymoon
[38:23] all right maybe some of you took long
[38:25] ones and went on them and done all this
[38:27] at the other
[38:28] you know what i'm getting at then
[38:31] it was a get-together time a learning
[38:33] time
[38:34] now you're thinking the other way okay
[38:39] your mind's going the other way i'm not
[38:41] on that all right
[38:42] i'm not on the living you know getting
[38:46] the sex acts i'm talking about getting
[38:48] together and learning each other so you
[38:50] get your mind up where my mind's at
[38:51] all right now all that other is natural
[38:56] we'll get into the spiritual it's just a
[38:58] time of getting to know each other
[39:01] that's why you know i i'll say it from
[39:04] the day that my wife and i got married
[39:06] we've had a wonderful time
[39:08] learning each other you know someone's
[39:10] been hard to do i guess but
[39:12] at least we've had time to learn each
[39:13] other
[39:16] i mean we we get to work so much we head
[39:18] toward town
[39:19] and i'll say where are you anywhere you
[39:21] want to
[39:24] because you know what i mean where you
[39:25] want to eat
[39:28] right see you just learn each other well
[39:31] that's kind of what the millennium is to
[39:32] be
[39:32] that's right amen while the world is
[39:35] proving the sin curse of god you're not
[39:37] having to prove that it's gone
[39:41] that's right come on if you get the
[39:44] numbers put your numbers in the right
[39:46] order see
[39:48] it wouldn't be us in the millennium
[39:50] living a thousand years
[39:52] and try to type of baptism of the holy
[39:54] ghost now we have the baptism in the
[39:56] holy ghost
[39:58] do we already have the the if the
[40:00] millennium if jesus had the millennium
[40:02] in him was by the new birth we got a
[40:04] millennium in us
[40:08] you understand what i'm saying that's
[40:09] the thousand years yes
[40:11] we don't have to worry about it we're
[40:13] going to be there
[40:15] it's not whether we're going to make it
[40:16] or not we've already made it
[40:19] it's already in us we just need to wait
[40:21] until this other catches up
[40:23] and that's what's happening if you get
[40:26] what i'm trying to preach to you
[40:27] we we got the new birth we'll get the
[40:31] resurrection more this evening we got
[40:32] the new birth
[40:37] all right but that puts our soul ahead
[40:42] we're having to wait till time catches
[40:45] up
[40:47] we're having to wait here in mortal
[40:49] bodies now
[40:51] waiting for god to fulfill the rest of
[40:53] his word
[40:55] to bring about a rapture
[40:59] and then take us to a married supper
[41:02] and it'll bring us into the millennium
[41:06] what a beautiful time it'll be
[41:12] do you think people don't want to know
[41:16] you remember little brown said the
[41:18] millennium would be to the jews
[41:20] as a nation
[41:25] now so that means there's going to be
[41:27] some jews there we know
[41:28] according to the prophet there's going
[41:30] to be 144 000 there
[41:34] all right what do you think you're going
[41:36] to be doing in the millennium
[41:40] you're going to be learning about him
[41:42] and then going out and telling them
[41:43] about him
[41:44] because they don't know about him like
[41:46] we do
[41:48] right the old testament saying you know
[41:50] the people there
[41:51] even though they'll be there but they
[41:52] won't be the bride that's right
[41:56] you know you don't have that part they
[41:58] rejected that right
[42:00] they'll be there but they won't be the
[42:02] bride of jehovah they'll be the
[42:05] his servants
[42:10] you know you understand what i'm getting
[42:11] at see it is this is something special
[42:13] to you and i
[42:14] yes and we're learning a lot here but
[42:16] what about when we get there
[42:22] i mean you dated for a long time right
[42:27] you thought you knew your boyfriend or
[42:28] girlfriend that's true
[42:32] until reality happened and you got
[42:34] married
[42:36] right then you begin to find out a lot
[42:40] of things
[42:41] he snores you see they do that why is
[42:45] dayton you know
[42:47] if that right sister anderson he snowers
[42:50] so you have to put a bedroom down the
[42:52] hall
[42:54] because of the snowboard but still after
[42:57] all
[42:58] this sweet snoring in there
[43:01] my wife will punch me all the time said
[43:02] turn over your snorer
[43:07] but i can say this with an honest heart
[43:11] 55 years and i never told her to turn
[43:14] over
[43:23] i don't care how loud
[43:36] you know why because that's my wife
[43:41] that's not why it's not just somebody
[43:44] that i've listened to snowboarding just
[43:45] keeps me awake man we go deer hunting we
[43:47] get
[43:47] we're always lined up with some
[43:54] all right so we got that fixed
[43:57] he pulled his camper down there and he
[43:59] said brother dale that's your
[44:00] just got a queen-size bed in there and
[44:02] he said that's your bed right there i'm
[44:04] gonna sleep on you i said no
[44:06] no way because see there's a door that
[44:09] can be closed to that room if it gets
[44:11] too bad
[44:13] and i can close him off and he can snow
[44:15] where all he wants to
[44:16] i'll just go to sleep all right i'm
[44:19] learning a lot
[44:20] you were gonna have a millennial right
[44:21] to learn about him
[44:23] it's not over with you brother said he
[44:26] gave us his message of cheer down to the
[44:28] endless ages
[44:31] and you realize what i'm saying then
[44:32] you'll be able to take it to others
[44:38] that heather and it's going to be there
[44:40] you'll be able to preach the gospel to
[44:42] them
[44:46] but i wish you could understand me and
[44:49] my ways of thinking and i'm sorry that's
[44:51] just me
[44:52] but you know they'll be glad to listen
[44:53] to moses talk about what god meant to
[44:55] him
[44:58] right they'll be glad to listen to
[45:02] joshua tell about
[45:05] crossing the red city that he heard from
[45:08] moses
[45:11] there's no problem with hearing it from
[45:12] somebody else and taking it to him so
[45:14] personal
[45:15] because the god in joshua that was
[45:17] standing there after they got over with
[45:19] the same god was in moses that's right
[45:21] that's right do you understand it's
[45:24] going to be a wonderful time of just
[45:30] learning about him that's the point i
[45:33] want you to understand
[45:36] just learning about your
[45:40] your groom your husband
[45:43] and then after that's over we got a
[45:45] future home to go to
[45:50] what a wonderful time
[45:53] and it won't be ever if paul said ever
[45:55] learning but never coming to the
[45:56] knowledge and the truth
[46:00] who has preached the gospel
[46:03] all right let me just quote a few of
[46:05] these and move on
[46:11] they asked brother brown in the
[46:13] questions and answers
[46:16] 1964. say will the millennial running be
[46:20] 1 000 years or just a count of time
[46:25] okay so count of down would be a
[46:27] thousand universe right
[46:28] you count what's his answer i got that
[46:31] one
[46:32] even this i got that one even this
[46:35] morning
[46:36] it's a thousand years
[46:40] so now if the person that said will a
[46:44] millennium be
[46:45] a thousand years of just time
[46:48] he would say that's around a thousand
[46:50] years
[46:52] but they asked would it be a thousand or
[46:54] just a count of time
[46:57] see the millennium is not a count of
[46:59] time
[47:03] right if the millennium
[47:07] is in jesus christ and if jesus christ
[47:09] is in you the millennium is in you
[47:11] now is it an account of time
[47:18] it's something wonderful okay
[47:22] now he said it's the seventh day
[47:28] god had a sabbath hebrews chapter four
[47:32] god had a sabbath and that seventh day
[47:34] was one thousand years long
[47:37] a top of the millennium
[47:41] atop of the millennium a thousand years
[47:46] then god rested from his work he rested
[47:49] one thousand years
[47:53] not because he's tired
[47:57] but as an example to where it would come
[47:59] up to be that there would be a time that
[48:01] we would
[48:02] somebody's going to live a thousand
[48:04] years
[48:07] but he rested
[48:10] now look at number three
[48:13] paragraph 189 questions and answers real
[48:16] number 1
[48:17] 64 8 23 in the morning service
[48:22] god made the world at 6 000 years and
[48:24] the 7 000
[48:25] he rested he said a man will never live
[48:28] that time out
[48:29] a year or a day day you eat there of the
[48:32] day you die
[48:33] adam or methuselah was the oldest man
[48:35] that was ever lived in the bible
[48:38] and he was 969 years old and he never
[48:40] lived that thousand years
[48:42] but the man that's going to live through
[48:45] the millennium
[48:47] 1000 years to show that the
[48:51] the penalty has been paid
[48:54] man lives forever the day is finished
[48:56] the time is finished
[48:58] they're in eternity
[49:02] it's going to be proving that the
[49:05] penalty of sin is gone
[49:07] well i don't think i got the new birth
[49:10] well i'm still looking at the penalty of
[49:13] sin whether you're looking at me
[49:14] thinking that way or not
[49:16] i'm still looking at you and i getting
[49:18] older and dilapidated and worn out
[49:22] i'm seeing the effects of sin
[49:25] and what sin has done to us
[49:28] but there's going to be a day that there
[49:31] won't be any
[49:33] penalty to be paid
[49:37] he paid the penalty himself
[49:42] see then you're going to rule and reign
[49:44] and the ruling rain you've got to have
[49:45] somebody to rule over
[49:46] that's right so then you won't be ruling
[49:49] over each other
[49:53] all right and then it wouldn't be right
[49:56] to rule
[49:57] over israel
[50:02] if it was to them as a nation
[50:07] that was promised right when it promised
[50:10] to david then his son would sit on his
[50:13] throne
[50:14] amen that was the promise of the
[50:16] millennial reign because that's where
[50:17] he'll do
[50:18] he'll be the son of david then solomon
[50:21] in the natural was the son of david but
[50:23] he didn't live a thousand years
[50:25] yet he had a utopia time
[50:29] putting together david and solomon and
[50:31] you wind up with a thousand years that
[50:32] they had peace back there
[50:35] from their enemies you know when you
[50:36] finally get over the end of david in his
[50:38] troubles
[50:39] but think about it
[50:42] to show the sin curse is gone
[50:47] look at number four paragraph 177
[50:50] question answer 62 527
[50:55] and then at the return of the church and
[50:57] bride the bride and christ you'll walk
[50:59] out upon the righteous
[51:00] into the millennium now you know that
[51:03] some people teach we're going to walk
[51:04] out upon our own ashes
[51:06] that's a doctrine in this message
[51:11] you say well brother dale wolf all i try
[51:15] to do is warn you
[51:18] because you may listen to so and so and
[51:20] then preaching so beautiful
[51:21] and you think boy that's right we're
[51:24] going to walk out upon the ashes or
[51:26] we're going to walk on our own axes
[51:31] we're going to walk out upon the ashes
[51:33] of them that burns up but it won't be
[51:34] ours well i'm going to drop mine no
[51:39] if you're going to raise it up you've
[51:40] got a problem then
[51:42] you better make the ass as you're living
[51:44] in eternal
[51:47] right then you won't be walking out on
[51:50] your own ashes
[51:51] all right walk out upon their ashes
[51:55] in the millennium where the earth is
[51:57] purified by fire
[51:59] and they then and theirs they shall
[52:02] reign and the heathen that's never heard
[52:04] the gospel
[52:05] shall be raised in that time now that
[52:08] was one of the things no theologian ever
[52:10] picked on none of that up or nothing
[52:13] your prophet brought it out and the sons
[52:16] of god will be manifested
[52:18] if he's the rain he's got to have
[52:19] something to reign over
[52:21] he's got a domain and they ruled and
[52:23] rang with christ and christ ruled with
[52:24] the wrought of iron the nation
[52:26] then the gospel then the manifested sons
[52:28] of god with the authority
[52:30] just like he had when he was here
[52:33] there will come the millennium in that
[52:36] reign the upon the ashes
[52:39] because that fulfills of malachi
[52:42] 4 when the son of righteous rochester's
[52:45] writing even in his wings and
[52:46] coming forth you know and i want to
[52:48] fulfill malachi 4.
[52:50] but he understands what i'm saying the
[52:51] heather is going to be raised up so
[52:53] who's going to live a thousand years and
[52:54] he's
[52:54] going to live a thousand years yes
[52:57] because the prophet never said they'd be
[52:58] raised up eternal or whatever they
[53:00] are and i don't understand it so don't
[53:02] ask me are they eternal i don't know
[53:05] i just know the prophet said the healing
[53:07] would be raised
[53:08] that's right all right so that solves
[53:11] the problem
[53:13] he explains how that those things are
[53:15] about because
[53:16] of of paul talking in the scriptures you
[53:18] know it'll hit me in a second but
[53:20] he's talking about being judged one of
[53:23] another
[53:24] and right around said a lot of those
[53:25] here and lived according to their tribes
[53:27] or
[53:27] perfect life better than ours that's
[53:29] right
[53:30] what are you doing just throw them into
[53:32] hell for because you didn't take the
[53:34] gospel to him
[53:36] right come on
[53:40] i'm glad he's going to give the heathen
[53:41] an opportunity
[53:44] to be able to hear the gospel you know
[53:47] it's going to deliver to we are
[53:51] going to be a lot of people in the
[53:52] millennium if you get down to thinking
[53:53] about it you've got your
[53:54] israel as a nation you got 144 000 you
[53:57] got all your fist sealed you
[53:58] where are you going to put them show me
[53:59] where to go to the bathroom
[54:02] i want it in the bible and i want the
[54:03] prophet's message
[54:08] you can't put those at the white throne
[54:12] all right i ain't gonna be able to get
[54:13] down to what i want to get on it but
[54:15] just think they've never heard the
[54:18] gospel so they'll hear the gospel
[54:20] so you're gonna rule and rain not ruling
[54:22] rain like a rod of iron as we were
[54:24] reading
[54:24] like water just covering them it won't
[54:27] be no problem
[54:30] right there won't be no devil
[54:34] he's going to be busy he's going to be
[54:37] in the bottomless pit but he's trying to
[54:39] dig himself
[54:40] that's right you know why the hell's not
[54:44] eternal because he called the bottomless
[54:45] pit see
[54:46] and that there ain't no bottom to it so
[54:48] if hell can't be currently just keeps
[54:49] falling
[54:52] you can't break up those signs but now
[54:54] watch the prophet said i believe in the
[54:56] millennial running
[54:58] the physical return of the lord jesus
[55:01] that's invisible union paragraph 34.
[55:04] to take a physical people
[55:08] glorified by his cleansing blood
[55:12] all right we'll reign with him for a
[55:15] thousand years right jump on over then
[55:20] to number eight brother
[55:22] anderson let's see where the chill back
[55:24] turns so they're swapping out a little
[55:25] bit today
[55:29] well look what happens now to satan
[55:32] you say well how can you have a thousand
[55:34] years
[55:36] of perfect peace you can't unless you do
[55:39] something with the devil
[55:42] i mean you've got to deal with it
[55:44] because he's the guy that's caused all
[55:45] his problems
[55:46] and he ain't going on vacation you know
[55:50] he's gonna have to be dealt with him so
[55:52] god tells you how
[55:54] he's dealt with
[55:59] revelation 23 and cast him into the
[56:02] bottomless pit and
[56:03] him up and set a seal upon him that he
[56:06] should
[56:07] deceive the nations no more to the
[56:09] thousand years before phil
[56:11] and after that he must be loosed a
[56:12] little season
[56:14] now cast him into a bottomless pit
[56:20] looks like a chain look like some kind
[56:22] of doing but let's get this let's get
[56:24] these
[56:24] go ahead number nine let me get these
[56:26] five
[56:28] this is the junction of time 1956 11
[56:31] 15 or e7 it's 79
[56:35] we know that we're in the great day of
[56:37] the life's reign
[56:39] when satan will be bound and cast into
[56:41] the pit chained with a chain of
[56:43] circumstances
[56:45] not a log chain you can't hold satan
[56:47] with a log chain you can't shut him up
[56:48] in a building
[56:50] and lock a door right
[56:53] you just go through the wall because you
[56:55] don't have any
[56:56] spirit all right so it's chained with a
[56:58] chain of circumstance what
[57:00] that he cannot come out and deceive the
[57:03] nations no more
[57:07] he won't have anybody he can deal with
[57:12] you certainly ought to think that the
[57:13] bride of jesus christ he won't be able
[57:15] to deal with us
[57:17] because we're supposed to cast satan out
[57:19] now
[57:20] right he's supposed to be out of our
[57:24] soul where god's not living there
[57:27] he's supposed to be cast out if we can't
[57:29] cast him out now
[57:31] then there won't be no chain of
[57:32] circumstances to hold him right
[57:35] he cannot come out and deceive the
[57:37] nations no more a thousand-year
[57:38] millennial reign will take place on the
[57:40] earth
[57:40] while we're glorifying our lord jesus
[57:42] and adorn him crowding him
[57:44] the king of kings and lord of lords
[57:46] going for the next
[57:50] this is where he says not a log chain
[57:52] the living room with christ for a
[57:54] thousand years
[57:55] upon the earth and on the count of the
[57:57] time the parable
[57:58] this comes to the sabbath not because
[58:01] his subjects is all in hell
[58:06] the reason satan won't have anybody to
[58:08] deal with in the millennium all
[58:09] his subjects is busy somewhere else
[58:13] you know that brother branham even
[58:14] explains i didn't bring it but he says
[58:19] why is he loose for a little season he
[58:20] says together all of his subjects
[58:24] bringing them to the white throne
[58:25] judgment but he don't know that
[58:29] he can't raise the dead now i didn't say
[58:31] that okay
[58:34] but when god raises the dead satan will
[58:36] be right there
[58:38] thinking man he's in control again
[58:42] but he's only leading him to the white
[58:43] trunk
[58:45] if we get time we'll find out he don't
[58:46] even get to make it
[58:51] okay we get kind of see his subjects is
[58:54] all the people satan's bound
[58:58] he can't work he has nothing he can do
[59:00] he's helpless and hopeless
[59:02] just waiting for the resurrection of the
[59:03] subjects
[59:07] not a chain of circumstance i'm not a
[59:09] chain to hold him not a building to put
[59:10] him in
[59:11] a pit to drop him in it this means that
[59:13] he
[59:15] is taking away any ability that he has
[59:19] to work through mine that's why you're
[59:21] going to have a utopia
[59:23] a thousand years without saying
[59:27] he's going to be tied up right he's
[59:30] going to be
[59:44] number 12 brother anderson
[59:50] revelation 20 you find the very
[59:51] interesting scriptures
[59:53] and when the thousand years are expired
[59:55] satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[59:57] and shall go out to deceive the nations
[1:00:00] which are under four quarters of the
[1:00:02] earth
[1:00:02] looks like some kind of a uh doing but
[1:00:05] he's really bringing his subject to the
[1:00:07] resurrection
[1:00:09] i mean he's actually getting them after
[1:00:10] the resurrection because they're going
[1:00:11] about to be raised up
[1:00:14] huh you say well there could be some
[1:00:15] people on earth leaving that's up to you
[1:00:17] whatever you want to do
[1:00:18] because it will come to gog and magog
[1:00:20] which will be a final termination
[1:00:22] and gog and magog will be destroying
[1:00:25] demons and everything
[1:00:27] right not just uh doing they went up on
[1:00:30] the red
[1:00:31] sea then was cast into the lake of fire
[1:00:33] and brimstone where the beast and the
[1:00:35] false prophet are
[1:00:36] and shall be tormented day and night
[1:00:38] forever and ever what about
[1:00:39] satan the author and the instigator of
[1:00:43] hell
[1:00:44] winds up going there or the lake of fire
[1:00:47] which we'll get to in a second
[1:00:49] he goes there but the devil is cast in
[1:00:53] after the millennial reign because he
[1:00:56] lives for a little season
[1:00:58] but look at the next scripture coming up
[1:00:59] to the next one look at number 13.
[1:01:02] you remember the other day when i
[1:01:03] brought this out revelation 19 20
[1:01:07] once and the beast was taken and with
[1:01:09] him the false prophet
[1:01:11] that wrought miracles within which we he
[1:01:13] deceived them that had received the mark
[1:01:14] of the beast
[1:01:15] and then that worshipped his image these
[1:01:17] both were cast into the lake of fire
[1:01:19] burning with brimstone
[1:01:23] that's very interesting to me because
[1:01:25] according to my understanding from the
[1:01:27] prophet
[1:01:29] and the bible that every man has to be
[1:01:31] judged first before he can be cast into
[1:01:33] the lake of fire
[1:01:35] that was not the lack of fire death and
[1:01:36] hell were reading the minutes cast into
[1:01:38] the microphone
[1:01:38] like a fire is a final annihilation
[1:01:43] can be for thousands and thousands of
[1:01:46] years but
[1:01:46] it'll finally become extinct but now
[1:01:49] listen
[1:01:51] how come these can be cast in and how
[1:01:53] come satan can be cast in
[1:01:55] and after the thousand years has expired
[1:01:58] he'll be cast into
[1:01:59] the lake of fire you don't have no
[1:02:02] record that satan has to go to judgment
[1:02:04] i got one quote from brother around he
[1:02:05] said
[1:02:06] satan's got to be judged i agree with
[1:02:07] him
[1:02:09] because he's judged himself now the
[1:02:12] reason it says the beast and the false
[1:02:14] prophet that's not referring to just
[1:02:16] literally man because the beast is satan
[1:02:20] rome which is many people which is a
[1:02:22] spirit
[1:02:24] the false prophet is a spirit not
[1:02:27] necessarily a physical being because
[1:02:29] there's many many many false prophets
[1:02:31] right and see the demons can be cast in
[1:02:34] without having to be judged
[1:02:38] you say let me make god no you don't
[1:02:41] understand
[1:02:42] every man that ever lives on the earth
[1:02:44] has to be judged
[1:02:47] you ain't listening what i'm saying if
[1:02:50] it's a man who's got to be judged satan
[1:02:51] is not no man
[1:02:52] that's right
[1:02:56] he's an angel
[1:02:59] a created being he's not a human being
[1:03:02] body soul spirit
[1:03:04] so then your beast and your false
[1:03:06] prophet is cast in even before the
[1:03:08] millennium comes
[1:03:13] then after the millennium is over
[1:03:14] satan's cast in
[1:03:17] and will be annihilated because brother
[1:03:19] said that will be annihilation over
[1:03:21] demons and everything
[1:03:24] no time you come to the future home
[1:03:26] there's not going to be anything
[1:03:27] but i hope you understand what i'm
[1:03:29] saying every person has to be judged
[1:03:34] but angels are not people
[1:03:37] they will be judged yes
[1:03:42] but they don't you know satan and him
[1:03:44] won't have a chance to stand to watch on
[1:03:45] judgment deplete the case
[1:03:49] that's the point i want you to see he
[1:03:51] won't have a chance to plead his case
[1:03:57] those that white throne will have a
[1:03:58] chance to plead your case right
[1:04:01] but you better believe we don't want to
[1:04:02] stand there
[1:04:04] because what would be cleaning your case
[1:04:07] you remember the the man that brought
[1:04:08] around was talking about city that he
[1:04:10] stood there you know and
[1:04:11] he said they wouldn't nobody's going to
[1:04:13] represent him but said jesus stepped up
[1:04:14] well that man wouldn't have wiped on
[1:04:16] judgment doing that he was talking about
[1:04:17] other things but
[1:04:18] he said he stepped up and said put it on
[1:04:20] me
[1:04:21] foolish virgins it'll be put on him at
[1:04:23] the white throne we'll get to that
[1:04:26] but satan's not a man he don't have to
[1:04:28] be judged
[1:04:30] you don't have to be lenient on him i'm
[1:04:33] sorry for him
[1:04:35] i really am because he can't be saved
[1:04:38] he made his choice a long time ago and
[1:04:40] he's judged when he made that choice
[1:04:44] the beast is the symbolics
[1:04:47] the false prophet is a symbolics
[1:04:51] because it would take millions of people
[1:04:52] to be the false prophet
[1:04:54] right but it's just symbolics he's
[1:04:57] showing you
[1:04:59] a judgment is cast on them now because
[1:05:02] revelations 20 and 14
[1:05:04] says death and hell was cast into the
[1:05:06] lake of fire
[1:05:08] this is the second death
[1:05:14] this is the second death
[1:05:17] all right
[1:05:20] see the second death is what we don't
[1:05:22] want to go to
[1:05:24] he said he's captain to hell his second
[1:05:26] death you're okay
[1:05:28] you know but just being technical it
[1:05:30] won't work
[1:05:31] because death and hell is both cast into
[1:05:34] the lake of fire the lake of fire is the
[1:05:38] second death
[1:05:40] that's why the soul will die that's not
[1:05:44] born again
[1:05:46] the soul that doesn't have eternal life
[1:05:49] right
[1:05:50] even if you go to the white throne and
[1:05:52] receive it as a foolish virgin you will
[1:05:54] have eternal life
[1:05:58] and the soul that senate that shall die
[1:06:00] for the second death
[1:06:02] that's why the bible says don't fear him
[1:06:04] that can destroy the body
[1:06:05] that's right right
[1:06:09] but fear him that can destroy body and
[1:06:12] soul
[1:06:12] is that scripture see because they're
[1:06:16] going to be annihilation
[1:06:19] he said well that's a horrible thing to
[1:06:20] think about all of the billions and
[1:06:22] billions and billions of people that
[1:06:23] think
[1:06:24] that we'll have to burn in hell maybe
[1:06:26] for a million years
[1:06:28] 10 million century but they won't burn
[1:06:30] there eternally because we don't believe
[1:06:31] in the eternal
[1:06:32] hell i know we've been talked that down
[1:06:34] to there but there's no scripture for it
[1:06:36] that's where our teaching is wrong show
[1:06:38] it to me you would have to have eternal
[1:06:41] life
[1:06:42] to be able to burn in hell eternally is
[1:06:45] that sensible amen
[1:06:47] you would have to have eternal life all
[1:06:49] right and then you would have god's own
[1:06:51] life because he's the only one eternal
[1:06:53] and that'd be putting god in hell that's
[1:06:54] right see that's what they never thought
[1:06:56] about
[1:06:58] the preacher a preacher in hell like a
[1:07:00] good old baptist he likes to fry you
[1:07:01] over hell like a weenie
[1:07:03] so he likes to scare you
[1:07:06] you take away his doctrinal point of
[1:07:08] that and he's lost
[1:07:09] because he likes to get to the end of
[1:07:10] the sermon and scare you if you don't
[1:07:12] get saved you're going to die and go to
[1:07:14] hell eternally
[1:07:18] no the bible speaks of eternal judgment
[1:07:21] true
[1:07:22] because once you're judged you're judged
[1:07:24] that's what i said about satan he's
[1:07:26] already judged
[1:07:27] that's right
[1:07:31] he's judging been cast into the lake of
[1:07:33] fire the beast in the false prophet is
[1:07:35] cast in there without having to go to a
[1:07:37] white throne
[1:07:40] because they're already judged and
[1:07:43] you're not dealing with human morals
[1:07:45] you're dealing with demons
[1:07:49] demons don't have a right of any form of
[1:07:53] correction or straightening up
[1:07:56] you'll just be burnt up one day
[1:08:01] but you say well that's horrible to
[1:08:03] think about an eternal i mean
[1:08:04] a hell that would be from millions of
[1:08:06] years
[1:08:09] never one day it'll be extinct
[1:08:13] because if you put him in hell eternally
[1:08:16] you've got god going to hell
[1:08:20] solve the problem or be sensible enough
[1:08:22] to think about
[1:08:23] you'd have to have god's own life
[1:08:25] because god's the only one that's
[1:08:26] eternal
[1:08:27] and if you have an eternal hell you'd
[1:08:29] have to have god's own life living in
[1:08:30] hell
[1:08:31] then you'd have god going to hell that
[1:08:33] wouldn't work well he went what
[1:08:35] he did he went one time but he sure
[1:08:36] didn't stay he kicked satan over into
[1:08:39] the bed and come on back
[1:08:40] up right right you see what i'm talking
[1:08:44] about little simple
[1:08:45] poet little dogs to tie together look at
[1:08:49] the lights quote
[1:08:51] this is taken from the sumerian church
[1:08:53] age which is church a book
[1:08:55] page 133
[1:08:59] and we all know that the second death is
[1:09:02] the lake of fire
[1:09:04] revelation 2014 and death and hell were
[1:09:06] kept to do elect for this is the second
[1:09:08] day
[1:09:08] and of course that means all those who
[1:09:11] with our end were cast into the lake of
[1:09:13] fire
[1:09:13] and they don't want to bring out
[1:09:14] something here for you and that's what
[1:09:16] he brings out
[1:09:17] that you cannot have eternal hell
[1:09:23] if you did you'd have god living in hell
[1:09:26] but think about it
[1:09:32] what a wonderful thing it is to think
[1:09:33] about this
[1:09:35] if we have eternal life
[1:09:39] by the new birth
[1:09:42] then
[1:09:46] we have the millennium inside of us
[1:09:50] we don't have to worry about the
[1:09:51] judgments and the things
[1:09:54] we already have eternal life the
[1:09:56] millennium is not
[1:09:58] to just say the reason it says a
[1:10:00] thousand years is to just prove the sin
[1:10:02] curse you'll come
[1:10:07] the brother in this message said that
[1:10:09] that's really not millennium there and
[1:10:10] it's millennial which would mean
[1:10:11] thousands well
[1:10:12] i don't know that's none of my business
[1:10:14] i just know one thing for certain
[1:10:16] i'm not concerned about it because it's
[1:10:19] not me that's going to be living a
[1:10:21] thousand years it's the heathen going to
[1:10:22] be living a thousand years
[1:10:23] and what happens to him i don't know so
[1:10:25] don't ask me say well what are they
[1:10:27] going are they going to be saved well
[1:10:28] the gospel is going to be preached to
[1:10:29] him so
[1:10:30] the gospel is preached to him and let's
[1:10:31] be an opportunity because why would you
[1:10:33] preach to them if there's not
[1:10:34] you know there's no need to preach it to
[1:10:36] them it's all right that's fine
[1:10:38] i don't know i don't mind telling you
[1:10:40] when i don't know i don't know
[1:10:42] because i can't find where the prophet
[1:10:43] said
[1:10:46] but i thank god for the truth
[1:10:49] to be able to show me that there's going
[1:10:51] to be a millennial ring one day
[1:10:54] we're going to have a million years
[1:10:58] i can preach a sermon then i'll probably
[1:11:00] get done
[1:11:02] i wouldn't have 89 sermons already on
[1:11:05] the book of revelation i can have a
[1:11:08] thousand years or something to preach
[1:11:12] because see it's not going to be just a
[1:11:14] it's not going to be a preaching
[1:11:16] services
[1:11:17] if you understand what i mean your
[1:11:18] sister is going to have your chance
[1:11:21] the brothers you're going to have your
[1:11:22] child so there's going to be no kids
[1:11:23] there but
[1:11:24] in the bride right because we're going
[1:11:27] to be the same age
[1:11:28] but you'll be able to talk to people yes
[1:11:31] but it won't be
[1:11:33] see this is the one thing i like
[1:11:37] the garden of eden was a millennial
[1:11:40] right now are you listening for a second
[1:11:44] beautiful utopia everything perfect
[1:11:49] it wasn't hot it wasn't cold it wouldn't
[1:11:52] everything
[1:11:54] everything was just perfect but then
[1:11:57] satan come along
[1:12:01] there were no crooked trees there was no
[1:12:03] worked up fruits with no
[1:12:05] naughty apples nothing but everything
[1:12:07] was perfect the satan come along
[1:12:11] and he began to pervert
[1:12:14] but see one day there's going to be a
[1:12:15] millennium it ain't going to be no shape
[1:12:18] you don't have to walk around is he
[1:12:21] going to come out of the bushes and
[1:12:22] deceive me
[1:12:24] no he won't be nowhere around
[1:12:30] you don't have to worry about him when
[1:12:33] he's loose for a little season they
[1:12:34] asked brother brown said where would the
[1:12:36] bride be
[1:12:37] when some of those things he said she'll
[1:12:39] be on the outer rims of the earth
[1:12:41] now you explain that i don't know
[1:12:45] see because satan ain't going to be able
[1:12:47] to deceive us
[1:12:48] he can't do it now if you're a
[1:12:50] born-again christian he can hinder you
[1:12:53] give you problems but he cannot deceive
[1:12:56] you
[1:12:58] that's a wonderful time i'm already
[1:13:01] enjoying it that way if you preach the
[1:13:03] millennium
[1:13:04] as beginning in the millennium the day
[1:13:06] you got born again i wouldn't
[1:13:07] argue too much with anybody about it but
[1:13:10] i'd just say it still ain't no
[1:13:12] millennium around here now
[1:13:13] it ain't been for 2000 years so that's
[1:13:17] just going too far
[1:13:20] but i think we're having order wonder
[1:13:22] church we know what's going to take
[1:13:24] place there
[1:13:26] we go here what's going to take place
[1:13:28] there
[1:13:31] he said well just a million little cabin
[1:13:33] right around i said you'll hear me over
[1:13:34] there
[1:13:35] he goes to the future home with it
[1:13:39] because he didn't care a little log
[1:13:42] cabin
[1:13:43] he didn't hear
[1:13:46] he was offered all kind of money we were
[1:13:48] listening to him last night all kind of
[1:13:50] money you know that he could have had
[1:13:52] but he didn't want none he said what
[1:13:55] does it matter whether you have money
[1:13:58] or whether you have a nice home or just
[1:14:00] a home
[1:14:03] he said what does it matter
[1:14:08] it's as long as you got jesus christ
[1:14:11] you remember the old hate jamala story
[1:14:14] he said i've been in king's palace and
[1:14:16] you know he prayed for king jordan he
[1:14:18] said i've been in king's house
[1:14:19] he said but never was i'm more welcome
[1:14:21] when i walked into iran
[1:14:27] a lot of difference
[1:14:31] but you see church we're gonna go to a
[1:14:32] millennial run
[1:14:34] for a thousand years and that's gonna
[1:14:37] prove
[1:14:38] that the sin curse is totally
[1:14:40] acknowledged
[1:14:42] well from there on there's not no
[1:14:43] opportunities
[1:14:45] once satan
[1:14:48] is thrown into the lake of fire that's
[1:14:51] his second death
[1:14:53] he's not seen anymore after the lake of
[1:14:55] fire
[1:14:57] because you get into 21 and 22 and
[1:14:59] you'll get into the
[1:15:00] future home right
[1:15:06] satan won't be nowhere around won't be
[1:15:07] no trouble
[1:15:11] that's what the resurrection means to me
[1:15:14] come on let's sing this song
[1:15:18] think on these things
[1:15:21] think on the fact that the resurrection
[1:15:24] made a way
[1:15:26] that you and i could live
[1:15:30] and have peace while we're here there
[1:15:32] never will be peace on earth until the
[1:15:33] millennium right may be peace in your
[1:15:38] heart
[1:15:40] but the world will never have peace
[1:15:45] but in the millennium it'll be perfect
[1:15:47] peace
[1:15:50] see i don't think you're going to be
[1:15:51] standing around looking at this clock
[1:15:52] and say
[1:15:53] when did you say that other day's going
[1:15:54] to end
[1:15:57] because that's what i'm saying that we
[1:15:58] can just go anywhere do anything we want
[1:16:00] to
[1:16:00] then it don't make no difference oh
[1:16:03] we're the bride cry
[1:16:06] but you know what they're doing now
[1:16:07] they're teaching in the message people
[1:16:09] some aren't doing this now
[1:16:11] that we're already into the millennium
[1:16:13] and the reason they're saying that is
[1:16:14] they're saying
[1:16:15] that we're in the millennium so we're
[1:16:16] under another covenant you heard that
[1:16:20] you've heard that we're under another
[1:16:21] covenant now since the seals broke
[1:16:24] and the prophet's message come and the
[1:16:26] lady will see an age ended
[1:16:30] they said it ended in 77 and it ended
[1:16:33] and when it did said we're under another
[1:16:35] covenant
[1:16:37] so now you women can cut your hair or
[1:16:39] wear your pants paint your face
[1:16:42] marry a dozen times don't make no
[1:16:43] difference because we're under another
[1:16:46] covenant
[1:16:48] sounds like satan's not bound yet right
[1:16:52] sounds like he's still working right
[1:16:55] go ahead 299 anybody have any 299 is a
[1:17:00] sparrow book
[1:17:17] my brother's having trouble with the
[1:17:19] blank you know that we've got blood
[1:17:20] clots they say
[1:17:25] but yet we believe
[1:17:31] we believe in a millennial
[1:17:34] we believe in a time now that we can
[1:17:36] rejoice
[1:17:37] and believe but by strike we're here
[1:17:42] in the name of jesus christ we lay our
[1:17:45] hands upon our brothers
[1:17:47] believing that by your stripes
[1:17:51] now just come and give energy back to
[1:17:53] the body
[1:17:54] all of these things that satan has taken
[1:18:10] said you
[1:18:18] in jesus name
[1:18:26] coming let's play
[1:19:06] yes
[1:19:20] uh
[1:19:34] down
[1:20:22] hear them
[1:20:44] is
[1:20:58] i'm
[1:21:26] is
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:54] you will never ever
[1:22:43] i
