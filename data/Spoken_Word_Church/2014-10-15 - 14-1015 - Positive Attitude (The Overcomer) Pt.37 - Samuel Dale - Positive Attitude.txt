will still be after you about meats and vegetables or whatever y'all do you know you just make sure you get all that figured out to Eaton's and I'll get to which sides you're on and if you don't like your side just move over the other one and show somebody out of a seat and tell them go sit on the other side so they can cook that but we always have a good time together around that time and just you know being thankful and having our Christmas time together too so is that all announcements I generally missed something remember that Revelations 3 and Revelations 21. the heavenly father we thank you for the day and the hour that we're leaving thank you Lord that you are God and you change not and we can depend on you then and we can know for a surety that we can trust you and know what all things work out for our benefit we might not like it at the time but we know that in the finality all things work together for good to them that are de called according to your purpose so we ask you to just have your way with us now and remember the sick ones Lord you promised it in your word you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we thank you God each and every one of us now and keep us in Jesus name amen okay we have one message companion remember we only had 10 or 12. so Ryan and Gabby got through with hers in a hurry this will be up here somebody get it and that's what we're supposed to be doing you know we're not giving these your personal copy it's to be through hurried up as quick as you can don't take two years you know well I'm a slow reader well give it to somebody else let them read and then you'll be lies okay all right but this there is a tape inside of here now so it explains everything and all but there is one copy up here and you take it but just get it get them back in and we give them out and let other people read and you know and enjoy it I really I appreciate it I went through it the other night in one night just reading and I really enjoyed it it's got a lot of information and a lot of pictures in it you know of things that um we are related to in the hour that we're living and uh you know the thing so it's it's really good it's really laid out in a good order all right Revelations 20. and we'll I mean excuse me we'll go to three first verse 20. and then we'll go over to 21. see behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and we'll shut with him and he with me now I'm watching that to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in now not on in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that half a year let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church is okay let's go to 21 and just read this one and we'll try our best to get back to this at the end of the message uh 21 verse 6 and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha Amiga the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcome us shall inherit all things now watch all things and I will what be his God and he shall be my son you may be seated in the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now what we've been doing is we've been talking about on the past couple of messages we're still on the positive attitude because remember how we bring that out that anyone in the Bible or really anyone in the natural out in the world uh you know if you don't have a positive attitude you're you're going to be defeated all right because you already are defeated but if you have a positive attitude it does work better but we don't believe in Christian Science Mind Over Matter that's not what we're talking about we're talking about when God speaks to someone then they have a positive attitude all right Peter said I have a more sure word of Prophecy what about a man that had walked with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years been up on the mountain with him saw all of the things but yet he comes down one day and he says I have a more sure or we have a more sure more positive attitude why because he had something reeled in all right he had a New Birth by then see that was the point all right but now we've been talking about death death you know what is death and how can we destroy it all right now that's the point all right now we found that death it's not just dying going to the Undertaker you know and say oh they died you know no because you don't die there your soul will live on no matter what you are if you're a sinner or a saint your soul will live on after the body is taken to the Undertaker and placed in the ground all right but we found it like John 3 and 18 says he that believeth not is condemned already you realize if we don't believe that we're already dead the woman the Bible says the woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she liveth all right now that's you know we're not dead we're spiritually Dead all right so now what did we bring down death to be unbelief what killed Eve in the garden to disbelief disbelievable God no she believed in her God she could tell you about him she done some pretty good preaching to the Beast all right the serpent dark all right but yet still there was something wrong and her problem the prophet said was she doubted God keeping his word and she disbelieved according to Hebrews 13 8 what that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if we believe that to be true we know he'll keep his word right all right see so now the worst thing that we could have is unbelief all right when I brought a day of blessed God I don't have no unbelief well pray I hope that's true you know I hope it's true what's revealed to us you know that there's no unbelief in what's revealed to us but like I was trying to bring out their Sunday lack of information or lack of understanding would bring us to unbelief we started off in this message as really unbelievers right because this message was so strange to us and and different from what we had read and studied and thought of of mankind so we really started off as unbelievers and God came down and changed that and made us to be Believers all right we'll see then if there's any doubt in our mind you think about Eve being mixed up on Hebrews 13 8. now you think about how small that would be we want to look at the dirty the problems the thing remember all of that came from the point of unbelief she was dead before her and the Beast came together to bring forth a child all right because of her unbelief amen right now what I'm saying she believed in God well brother Delaware did I just got to believe in God now what did the prophet say that we gave you the quote he said the unbelief in God who is the word so now if we have any unbelief you know about the word look where we're at all right you know that really unbelief is so hard I'll just quote these because you shouldn't know them anyway but unbelief is so of a bad thing that according to paragraph e found now these are not only things right about Thy word preaching 48. he cannot save you against your own will he cannot heal you against your own will you must believe that he is and a rewarder of those who diligently seek him is that right now what about the one thing that God can't do I mean you think about it he he can do all things but the one thing he can't do is save you if you don't want to be saved all right he didn't cometh God must believe that he is amen amen right all right now he goes on to a 1954 with a title of the same thing at Thy word Lord he says he cannot heal you he cannot save you or do one thing for you until you first accept it and believe it and confess it and remember in in the scriptures are you know in Romans you got to believe in the heart confessed with the mouth right all right not just one time you've got to be both he said that's right you've got to confess it now watch not you got to feel it you got to confess it he's not the high priest of your feelings he's the high priest of your confession all right and look what he gets down on the message called expectations in 1958 he said unbelief is a miserable thing he said it's terrible it's death Shadows of death is unbelief all right now so then that's what we've been trying to bring out let's see we can holler all we want to we believe the message but has it been revealed to us oh we believe in one God all right Eve did right well yet she brought death physically spiritually in everything upon mankind by her unbelief you see our problem today is our unbelief right do you say but brother Dale I believe everything the prophet said but you know that's a big mouthful you know if you believe that you won't miss a service unless you're in hospital or bad sick I know I'm dirty okay but is it true amen amen now you answer the question but brother yeah I know I know what the scripture says Jesus said you'd have had a cloak for your covering if I haven't spoke to you you said but yet well okay what is death unbelief he cannot save you against your will now that's that's what death that's what I've been driving that yeah but you just don't understand don't understand what I understand one thing whether you believe it or not we're dying you can pump up all you want to and stand in front of the mirror and put yourself up it don't make no difference we're dying and we're going to keep on dying until somebody recognizes the real death or what it is you remember how we brought it out even under the line Ministry that we'll get back in a minute it didn't call him death he didn't give him a name it was just an antichrist a spirit Etc under the ox the great time it was still not that under the man of the great intelligence it was not called Death but under the eagle then the eagle would be the only one to understand what is really death you understand that might give you a good thought to go back and read to see a book you might learn a lot and read it from a point of trying to find our unbelief and then you'd see why that I'm so what is the word adamant strong arrogant hateful whatever you want to call it this make your word up for yourself against doctrinal issues and things that I do not agree with because if I allow that to come Among Us then I'm allowing according to my understanding deaths to come Among Us make anybody uh take the word no more than God can heal you if you don't believe it all right but see that we can stand on the word and say well okay we believe that but I hope you was following me even down through that we brought on in how that death would be destroyed and the only way that death can be destroyed is by the revealed word why wouldn't you want the revealed word I just want to go to church and be a good person that's good I'd rather read all these other books and things and do this and okay get on your Facebook and stay all day you know more about each other than you do about the word have we let down on our children and things of teaching them about Jesus Christ are letting them just all they know is what we know and what we fool with okay but you know death is so horrible until even though the scripture tells you in Revelations 20 and 10 it talks about the devil is cast into the Lake of Fire and destroyed you know that's the purpose of it all right then it says in chapter 20 and verse 14 that death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death all right now I brought it out Sunday and you know kind of withheld a little bit back on that part for you to think on it because see when you say well what is the second death death of the Soul well that's good we've learned that you know that's wonderful we've learned that we've learned that the second death is the death of the soul and blessed he at part in the first resurrection over which the second death hath no part see I spend too much time on other things and don't get the end of a message you know but I'd hoping you're thinking a little about it but what about what kind of a lake is that when even the devil is annihilated in the Lake of Fire the Beast and the false prophet yep are put in the Lake of Fire annihilated because it can't be no such thing as eternal hell right so then it's got everything outside of eternal life it's got to be annihilated amen all right and then see true that the life the second death is the death of the Soul yeah because if that soul is not born again one day it will be destroyed so there's no such thing as eternal hell in those things you'd have to have eternal life to live in hell eternally and that put God's own life there so that won't work all right but what about then the point then I should have spent about four hours on Sunday his death and Hell death and Hell itself has to be annihilated coaches cast into the Lake of Fire that's the second death the scripture says why because the death of an individual is the death of the soul that would be you know no Eternal Health we'd understand all right but where did that come from it comes the devil so cast him in there and let him be annihilated that's what the scripture says then to turn around and say even the death that would destroy annihilate the devil in hell it will have to be destroyed because that's what scripture said then it says this is the second death you see it would have to be some some form of spiritual points as well as literal because all demons you know Devils Etc everything that would be perverted would be annihilated and only those with eternal life will escape that right all right so you see how important it is for us to get the new birth all right but now I want us to think about something tonight and relate back to that and and watch it now because I'm telling you what I'm doing so that you won't forget it in the message is we're trying to find the day that we're living in the word of God right well now what good would it do to find the day of somebody else's living what good is that to you and I that's already passed but we need to find the day we're living so go back and listen to that message brother random pre recognizing your day and its message well it's only to recognize God sent a prophet well why would he speak of the Bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily if that's all you need to know well that's just quotes you've come up with well I guess you just throw away what you don't want sister Barbara's husband he's you know what Islamic or what you want to call it I don't know what they call all of them but anyhow he said I believe the Bible should you do he said yeah yeah I said in other words you believe what you want to believe what you believe is right that's the way you believe the Bible and he started grinning he said yeah I said but something is contrary to what you're saying you don't believe that no no all right but think about it now looking for our day not looking for Luther's age Wesley's age Pentecostal age um Paul's age whatever but what is to be in our age all right now each age gets a message to the overcomer all right so we read about the Overcomer to the lady of CNAs that that overcomer will sit with him in his throne even as he has set in his father's throne huh now listen to the point we will cover the ages of each overcomer but remember that is uh to cover each age where we're doing individually but what that's doing is just relating that age to the time that was there right now like a characteristic you remember the prophet when he brought out about the seven Church ages that you find down in what is Asia Minor that was you know that the seven Church ages you know the seven churches is there you know there was a lady of sea and there was Philadelphia all those churches were there and all he was using that far in the scriptures was was to relate a characteristic of that City in relation to you know the people right so now follow that thought as we cover the Overcomer of each age think about the part that is spoken of but keep a lot of things keep it in your mind we'll get to that in a minute we've been through these so we don't have to give them but each age has had a part to do right amen amen each age it had a part of the word if you want these I'll be glad if they want to just run them up darn and let you read them as I talk a little bit go ahead to 1A and then we'll drop down through uh one A B and C go ahead and let them run and just think about it each age has had a part of the word right to be made manifest in that age okay so then each one would be something related a revelation of Jesus Christ because the book is a revelation of Christ right so each aides would have something connecting to revelation all right so then He makes himself known in his promises that's it is I'll Be not Afraid all right go to the next one B each age had its message and its messenger all through times ever age has packed its message with a messenger God in every dispensation is sent for someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age all right God's provided way for this day but each age has it's part of the Gospel already predicted this Bible is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ all right now so each age has a part of the word all right and it's a complete revelation of Jesus Christ so you can't leave out you can't come along and jump over and say we don't need Luther we don't need Wesley we we don't need they are the foundation that is holding us up whether you like it or not and each age had a part of the Revelation so if you leave that age out look what you're doing you're leaving out a part of the revelation of Jesus Christ are you following me so now when we come into the oh overcomer I want you to think about something now we'll get back to the scripture why we read that of all things but I want you to think about something to isolate an age and to put it by itself is not the form that God would desire to be done each age would be a part of the revelation of Jesus Christ and if we leave any of that out we would leave out a part of the revelation but it's so wonderful how he does things now here's a quote I want you to take and I want you to consider it for a long time go ahead with one D which is taken on how can I overcome 63 8 25 in the morning service he's coming down and he's reading how that he didn't overcome what would be a pillar of fire you know that's the part of these six Church age all right we'll get back to that in a minute I said watch what the Overcomer has promised see now now lady Lucia that's the last Church age there is going to be some Overcomers in there watch here they remember each Church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered so you know where you go wrong if you isolated any age you would have a part of the revelation of Jesus Christ and he wouldn't be Hebrews 13 8 and then you'd be wrong to say if the Overcomer could inherit all things so then keep in mind what is said there the age that precedes that sounds contrary to calculating humanly but it's wonderful revelation the preceding the age before right inherits what the next age brings that sounds contrary don't you see we look at it like this age put him over there this age gets that put him over there they say he's get that put him over there now what are you going to do with the scripture that I read in wrong in Revelations 21 7. said the Overcomer inherits all things and I'll be his God and he'll be my son should we stay right there for hours till you can get it clear out of your mind that you are different with me about what I'm saying well read it I didn't write it I wasn't the one that said it the preceding age is the age before the one that precedes you know Danny's not as old as I am I preceded him he didn't precede me all right are you with me the preceding age what that age gets the next age gets with what they got right you see that's where you're going to differ with me so go ahead but go home and pray about it because you're facing scriptures so then you're going to cut yourself off and you'll allow the unbelief all right well my brother Dale I just don't understand you is that unbelief not necessarily but when you go around and you talk to everybody else about what I say it and don't come to me you're in unbelief amen I didn't write the book but listen see watch it as we come down that you take an age you take an overcomer of that age and whatever he inherits the next days don't just get apart it gets what they got Plus what's made known for that age now watch that as we go through because if you don't get that right you're going to have this over here and you're going to have this over here and you're really going to cut yourself off so let's just read something and think about it go ahead brother and pull up number one unless we're going to read the Overcomer of each age I'm going to just make a comment to each one of them just on the basis of you know little things well we start off in Revelations 2 7. he said he didn't happen here let him hear what Spirit saith in the church to him that overcome it I'll get give to eat or the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God now what does that age get the Overcomer of that age what did it get to eat of the Tree of Life where is that at it's in the midst of the paradise of God what did the first church age get the new birth come on we got to start from there because it's starting on day of Pentecost right sure First Church age starts with a new birth then the Overcomer of that age grows in that new birth are you following it to the Overcomer of the age he grows in that new birth it started on a day of Pentecost with 120 and they had to fight to the fathers but on the day of Pentecost outside there was three thousand and they only got the new birth you'd be surprised how many people don't preacher don't even know that but you can't make that three thousand outside of the same understanding as the 120 was in the upper room look where you're leaving it out the great wonderful understanding but get what I'm talking about to the Overcomer of the age he not only gets the new birth but he gets a special revelation of Jesus Christ to him that that is the Tree of Life contrary to the tree of death that was in the garden aren't you following me all right look at your next one Revelations 2 11 and let's see either that or near what it let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcome or shall not be hurt of the second death now if you just walk out there with that by itself what have you got you know if you just isolate an age look what you've got you're going to have to find out what the second death is you're gonna have to find out all of those things but if you'll take the order of the prophet and the way he's bringing it that the first church age starts off with a new birth and didn't get so strong in relation to the Tree of Life that was in the garden I believe those people back there understood a lot more about serpent seed than we think we did they did you know that's up to you but I believe even them Pharisees understood a lot about serpent seat why would they tell Jesus we weren't born a fornication all right but are you with me now second Church age he didn't overcome or shall not be heard of the second death why because in the first he's already if he takes what's brought to him from the first age the preceding age is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the tree of life now you take the second Church Age and what he come up with he didn't overcome or shall not be heard of the second death so you know right then that you don't have to worry about your second death it's already been taken care of it because see you're just laying on top of that early age and coming out with the revelation of Jesus Christ in the second age we still not forget the revelation of the first age but builds upon there are you with me the Third Church age what is it Revelation 2 17. he didn't have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh I will get give to eat of the Hidden manna what and will give him a white stone and in the Stone a new name written which no man knoweth that he that receiveth it isolate that and what is your foundation with that put that Revelation that would be coming there upon that new birth that tree of life that revelation that you can't die God blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection over which part the second death hath no part see and now the Third Church age you see about we will get to that here in the Third Church age they get a hidden Manna what did everyone say special revelation going to church ages and read it come on you got time enough to fuss about it on the telephone and tell others you don't agree or talk to them but you ain't got time to sit down and read the church age book to see if what I'm saying is true and if you need it out to say your books Mr Christine will just give you what page number it is look I'll give him a white stone we could spend nights on just each one right and in the stone a new name written which no man North saving he that receiveth it now do you know that we've all got all happy you remember that we're Christians keep stacking up the Revelation one on top of the other and you'll find out what I'm talking about but isolate the age by itself as an individual part you're not believing in Hebrews 13 8. you're not walking into Revelation as it comes Higher and Higher and Higher and I thought that's what we believe the only way you could get the virtues was for the Revelation I thought the only way we could overcome death was by revelation look at the fourth one Revelation 2 26 28. he didn't overcometh and keep with my works unto the end hmm to him I will give power over the Nations and he shall rule the nations with a rod of iron as a vessels of a power shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I'll give him the Morning Star check that if you want to you don't have to translate it but if you'll check it the word Works can be used as word he that keepeth my word and to the end but let's turn it around and leave it works and not worry about it because if Works don't follow our revelation what is our Revelation worth anything okay but add all of this on to what you've already seen the new birth a tree of life the second death can hurt us keep adding it up remember the preceding age ties together to the next one it's like Star stems right and watch now even into the fourth age now may I go back to the seals just to hire the first church age started out with a line of the tribe of Judah all right that lasted somewhere in the neighborhood of Three Ages I say in the neighborhood called run around and we'll move it backwards and forth but he says he comes to taitara which is your fourth is that right see Columbus and he said then you're starting your ox he said to Pure unadulterated word lasted three ages up to the fourth age or part of the fourth age all right so then you bring it in your combat Beast in another way of looking at it you pull out one of those beasts what have you got you better consider what I'm talking about let it keep piling Revelation up on top of Revelation might give you an OP an interest in going back and reading the church age book and listen to see if these things are right but watch the fourth age to keep with my Works under the end will I give power over the Nations now if that's an unrelated Revelation that connects to nothing else now where are you the fourth Church age definitely was not ruling over Nations but it's a promise to the Overcomer of the fourth Church age that he'll sit on the throne with Jesus in the Millennium because our story is going to rule the Nations so you see what I'm talking about it keeps climbing higher and higher doesn't it all right and I'll give him the Morning Star a special revelation of Jesus Christ but roll down number three rather for me okay now what have you got you're gonna give him a Morning Star it's a special revelation of Jesus Christ but it's a special revelation of what he's making his people the Morning Star remember the Morning Star is the evening star right is that true the morning Stars the evening star it's just a position it is in the heavenlies right okay go to number five try to get in a hurry all right so he says diced a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments look what a beautiful statement about them and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white Raymond I thought we believed that white Raymonds was the righteousness of the Saints is that scriptural what and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life even though now listen even though by the field Church age they had went into organizationalism oh dares were people who are again that real bride never went no organization you better read again your Prophet said that the bride went down to and I see a Rome so you interpret all you want to by the fifth Church age they had done lost to revelation of the name of Jesus right now they didn't lose the name come on they didn't call him Charlie Jim or Joe right that's not what it's meaning they had lost the name and they come up with a name that they were living am I in the scripture all right clothed in white Raymond and I'm not blowed out his name out of The Book of Life but even though he's a trinitarian come on that's what they come out with Luther was a trinitarian we actually was a trinitarian trinitarianism state until associate and even after Azusa Street it was still in trinitarianism and so is it still today all right I'll confess his name before my father he's going to be just as happy to call the name of Luther is he is to call William Branham now you'll differ there go ahead you see you're going to try to pump up something and do it you don't have to pump up nothing all right he didn't overcome or shall be clothed in white Raymond the righteousness of the Saints and I will not blot out his name why is it saying that because they got away from his name that totally lost the revelation of the name of Jesus they made him a part of a trinitarian Doctrine but he said okay he said because I remember that when I laid the foundation and you would get on down in another and then you see when I laid the foundation in you said I laid it on the apostles and Prophets you may not have it totally right but you're still there you watch it when he gets to the serpent six Church age and how did he puts the name right in the Cornerstone in them still trinitarians but think about it I'll confess his name oh he'll confess my name because I stood when I was good if it is you're going to stand on what somebody else said if we don't understand don't assist together what they said before us where are we that's why we're not against the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian Catholics whatever we're not against people we're against the systems this made them unbelievers in God's word we love the people but we don't love the doctrines you see where you could stay going to number six you got it this is number six and watch because thou has kept the word of my patience okay brags on him but listen to tape the other day where brought around and said God knows how to raise children in a church any preparations you know he said if we just listen to that we might learn how to do a lot of things you know sometimes you got to whip you to get you to line up right amen because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation now what did Brother around say that meant he said he would keep them from going into the tribulation now that's you just go back and read the book you don't know it get it I'll be glad to get it for you which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold fast that which thou Hast that no man take thy crown now if they didn't have a crown why would it speak of somebody inability to take it from them with a crown being a revelation of of God's deity don't let nobody take that from you him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will ride upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name that's not in the lady ocean Church age that is in number six Church age that it's speaking of a new name and you know when you enter the seventh Church age he has a new name the name of Jesus was restored starting in Azusa Street with the Oneness doctrine of Jesus only not after Azusa Street they were trinitarians at zeusa Street about 14 somewhere in there Seymour and all of those begin to preach on those things and here comes people bringing in the name of Jesus revelation but look don't let nobody take your crown away from you I admire somebody was stunt was funk I'd rather see spunk than see well obviously rather Dale I feel simple I just keep it simple I don't understand that there's very little difference between stupid and simple what do you think if you're voluntarily simple because you don't want to know the Revelation then you're stupid I'm too mean I'm sorry you don't need to vote you another preacher and a pastor that'll help you and love you but listen I'll make him a pillow in the temple of my God you know what your Prophet said that is read it in church he said he'd take him right back and put him in the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets now we're right back where we started right the first church age the apostles and Prophets building a foundation Apostle Christ Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone now we're right back to what the prophet said the preceding age the age before that precedes that they get a revelation but then the next age gets that Revelation plus plus plus plus now we're right back to where we started that ought to be enough to prove the point I'm going to make in a minute about this that we went right back to the first church age he said well the uh the Methodist no they didn't get to go all the way back they got back farther than others did what you remember that revelation seeds you and I that Revelation precedes our age how much they understood was up to them but it was a revelation given unto him that's where your song books begin to Rewritten about the blood and the things and all of the things happening and there goes back to your works as we read on one of the other ages works is supposed to be your faith expressed but think about it in the sixth Church age you find the revelation of Jesus Christ coming back no not fully no no because it would be hard to bring in that age in time but to begin to talk about Jesus you remember what I said while ago that's what people thinks when we say that the revelation of Jesus was lost what do you mean they always called him Jesus well may I quote the prophet you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship the devil does that solve that problem I didn't write the book I just believe the book but look what it says go back to the foundation you know as they started back in a way to get back towards the foundation and that sixth Church age that's why it's called brotherly kindness right Philadelphia brotherly kindness is because they begin to see more about Jesus great revivals were back there in Luther and Wesleyan Presbyterian Baptist your great revivals was back in the time of the sixth Church age and then relating right on over into the seventh you see church I don't want to forget what they got I want what they got plus what he's going to be making known in this age right but now when we finish in a minute I'm going to go ahead and lay the bomb when we finish in a minute you're going to see that that first church age is going to get exactly what you get it's going to require a little thinking in it okay but you see it comes out to the name of my God in the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem was coming down out of heaven and I'll ride upon him my new name he said brother Dale you're not looking for a new night yeah but may I describe it this way death cannot be destroyed until the Resurrection comes you remember that Sunday when the Resurrection comes death is destroyed all right it means it's got to be destroyed in you and I spiritually speaking not physically but to bring them out of the ground so death's going to be destroyed all right and here's where he's at each age inherits what the preceding age had they don't just stand alone and put them out each one takes what the other has said let's look at your life this is the lady you'll see an age behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come in to him you know sup with him and he with me what a wonderful thing in this age remember the story of the painting that the man made the painting of Jesus coming to the door which you remember there was no latch on the outside of the painting and remember the critic said well you messed up there he said oh no sir he said I meant for it to be there he said yeah but you have no latch said the latches on the inside you've got to open the door you know if I'd have been that critic I'd have found me a 10 gallon hat I'd have crawled up under it and shoved it down and I wouldn't have never criticized nobody else you know right I won't charge you with that I'm just human but look can you take verse 20. can you take verse 20 and take it all the way back to the first church age go all the way back to partaking of the Tree of Life and come all the way down through the death can't hurt you come all the way through make your pillar a part of the revelation in the temple of God church this is one thing I thought and I'm sorry it's just in me we had a meeting down at Schoolhouse one time and this great man stood there and made statements and said Azusa Street was false Lutheran West for them didn't have nothing and Azusa Street was false I quoted brother Branham to the man standing there of many quotes that brought around and said the exact same holy ghost on the day of Pentecost is here now and it was there in Azusa Street and how that brother random said no Messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself talking about Azusa Street you know what he done he came right here to this church and said the same thing that those people were false and didn't have nothing I'm sorry but if I can save your soul by being stern and hateful I'll take my chance on the front seat in hell for you and that you don't believe but listen can you go back there and come down through ever Church age and see it's the revelation of Jesus Christ just constantly building until you come to this age and look I stand at the door and knock all right but around him said that the message always went to that's why it says to the churches each age it says to the churches he said that's the false Vine and the True Vine it condemns the false Vine and praises the True Vine in each age and we come down to this age look where we're standing behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come into him and sup with him and he with me I made a statement Sunday that I wonder if you were listening somewhere you're listening because I'd make a statement and it was sound incorrect to you and that's all you got but why would brother Branham have you ever heard a preacher preach and he preached I don't know how many I know these two or three called doors and doors you know in that he says that there's placing in our hearts that we have closed I said we've got to open them up behold I stand at the door and knock I got this Pride over here I got this yeah see I love this message the God is wonderful but watch now to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my Throne that doesn't say on because that puts you in a different category even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his strong now we went through in the message here just recently talking about that Christ is not sitting on his own throne he's sitting on who's strong the Father Strong the working of the holy spirit is going to pull it up brother number eight tonight Christ is not sitting on his own throne he's sitting on who's strong his father is strong he did overcome what shall sit with me on what's he my Throne as I have overcome and I'm sat down on my father's Throne isn't that marvelous and we have that great and Grand privilege of knowing that someday we'll be able to sit with him on his throne and he takes the Throne of David which is our two and we'll reign with him a thousand years on Earth and then through eternity now without the way that I've laid it out I want to ask you a simple question if his age is not stacking Revelation upon revelation the preceding you know and then the one we are passing on that revelation then is the end time bride going to be the only ones that will be sitting on the throne if you isolate the ages that's what you've got you would have this age only sitting in our own he's strong which is the Millennium right because that's the Father Strong remember climb up on my turn to sit down until I make your enemies your footstool till I destroy death till I bring all the pies are you listening look to the next one's questions and answers in 54. he isn't up on his throne now he's sitting on God's throne he that overcomes shall sit with me on my Throne as I have overcome and set on my father's throne now he's wanting to come back and where is his Earthly throne the Throne of David God said he'd give him the Throne of David in the millennium now and you'll see why that I believe as I do that in this age it must come to a bodily Redemption in this age must come to a bodily Redemption no other age had to face that they face death they face persecution they were killed they were sown asunder but none of them come to a change of the body so we're going to have to do that and remember whether it means anything to you or not but remember he comes in Three Sons now son of man Son of God Son of David and remember in the Mighty God unveiled before us go ahead and pull up number 10 the son of man back in the church revealed in human beings not Son of God but the son of man back in his church again unto I mean Son of God down Through the Ages there's a reason for that more than you think but he can't go from son of day a son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost straight into the millennium that don't mean nothing to most of you especially preachers they just say hi Philly but you show me how it can be done but let him come back here and go to the unveiling of God he says son of man Son of God Son of Man son of David you say that's four names I'll give you about five in just a minute if you want to argue but you see that's worth it I've always believed it from 1969 when I preached his pride would be the son of man I believe then what I believe today that that baptism of the Holy Ghost that was down through the ages in a wonderful position but yet it left Man Without a change of the body and the son of man must come back in the end time because the son of man is resurrection he said that the son of man have power to forgive sins I say unto thee take up your bed and walk brother random wooden be son of man he says it he said I'm a son of man that the son of man is to use what do you think about it back into church again as the son of man no leaven Among Us brings the fullness for the godhead bodily that's what your Prophet said where's it going to be revealing himself to son of man that concerns we would see Jesus 64. number 11. revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you get it see God down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom we know this statement that he's the beginning of the creation of God taken from proving his word paragraph 146 but he said this is the continuation of that creation of God and look what he said here number 13. the revelation of Revelations chapter 5 61. 6 18. now I want you to follow me real close then I'll try to quit as the son of David he's heir to the throne now here he brings in another you say well there's only three sons nine yeah but he has many many titles and connections to son as the son of Abraham he's heir to the Royal Grant that right he's there to the Royal Grant amen Palestine and all that's in her Abraham's seed he was the son of Abraham as son of man what does son of man what did man lose come on you can't tie that together with this is the revelation of the Redemption of the body where is he going to son of man what what did man lose he lost the Earth so as the son of man he's out to everything in the Earth all this he's got and he has to give it back to us then he's returning back as he was he's now then as the son of God he inherits all things the son of David he's a throne the son of Abraham he's heir to the Royal Grant as son of man he's heir to the Earth as Son of God he's heir to all things in heaven and Earth oh my that's Our Redeemer our Kinsmen Redeemer I'm honest when I first read dad I thought for one time brother Branham I don't agree with you what'd you think what are you sitting there thinking now when you've got all of these great grants and things that goes on the air to the Earth The Heirs of this the Earth of that why does it fall back to the son of God be in the air of all things you didn't thought that way Son of God is the heir of all things in other words there's the greatest Grant of all David Abraham son of man anything you bring in the Son of God he's heir to all things in heaven and Earth there would not be a son of David there would not be a son of Abraham it would not be a son of man and did not first been a son of God are you with me you remember I asked the question years ago and I know it offends you when I asked a question about son of man Son of God I said when do you think of Son of God and everybody was saying oh 2000 years ago down there when he come I said you don't even follow your Bible I know it offended you and I'm sorry not for the truth I'm sorry that you got offended and I know a lot of you did but you see the Son of God was at first one that come out of God in the beginning that was the logos the Creator that's what your Prophet says do we stay all night quote what he says he said that Son of God was the word that created all things son of man went back there creating gentleman come on Earth and started this creating because he created you and I but who was that the Son of God in that son of man creating his own bridegroom don't never leave Son of God out of it make it where it's supposed to be all of those things that look great to be what we think we need this we need that we need to baptism of the Holy Ghost more than we need anything in the world and without the baptism of the Holy Ghost there ain't no need to worry about son of man Son of God Son of David I'm trying to who because we wind up being son of hell that'll be our judgment do you understand can you follow me then let's read over here in Revelations 3 21 again I mean 21 7. go to six and he said unto me it is done I'm out for the Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of this fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things now watch him and I'll be his God and he shall be my son I got some quotes in here about adoption if you'd like to stay a while but you ought to understand Prophet even says God's waiting on you and I adoption time when he can for pour into his fullness and adopt these children Son of God is the adopter son of man is the individual part to be adopted when he walked on this Earth that son of man was the word made flesh that Son of God was in him oh it's a rising of the Sun but the man said who is this son of man he said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God no no no no no no no no no that Son of God oh wonderful but just remember only by the new birth to you inherit anything now are we right so we started off the first church age with a new birth the second Church age had the newborn third fourth fifth sixth seventh that new birth is the son of God adoption brings you into talking of Son of Man will bring us to a bodily Redemption that's why she's got to be the fullness of the godhead bodily that's why she's got to be the son of man the word made flesh that's why she's going to speak and the dead will raise but you ain't going to leave Paul out of it because he had the Holy Ghost you ain't going to leave Luther Wesley anybody out of it because they had the Holy Ghost for their age they had the Son of God for their age the new birth we are just coming to a point to fulfill the bodily Redemption to make it to where we can stand in the millennium with him we're sitting here strong if we overcome and sit in the Father Strong the father strong is a baptism of the Holy Ghost right let's stand come on bro do you understand don't make each age just an isolated Affair of each one and a thought that comes from that age read each one of them and read your church age book and look how each one of them is related to the other because he that overcometh will inherit all things and I'll be his God and he'll be my son look what a wonderful thing it is to be a child of God what a wonderful point it is to be a Christian what a wonderful hour are leaving the end of all things the Bible said has come upon us what do you think is going to bring it according to my understanding that's what you can place it at I guess according to my understanding a move among the bride is to bring the World Church against us that's according to my understanding of what I read the prophet is being saying a move among the people there'll only be a move among those who know who they are and can see who they are that's right the others will never know the move is on you know when the prophet was singing that one day about the move is on he said that's thus saith the Lord it's on but you know what it only on for them it'll move what do we got brother we'll do that all right uh is that seven in there humidity anybody has a need the order is open think about that new birth is what makes you a child of God that new birth makes you a child of God all the other things are related to that new birth to bring you and God has won to walk off this Earth I hope you're listening at the end I didn't spend enough time but either overcometh in this age you'll sit with me in my Throne as I've overcome and sit with my father if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and said not New Birth then we can sit in a millennium with him you know what Luther will be there too all of those down through there was a new birth will be there why because one day they will inherit all things each age will inherit the age prior and the age after the best way to say it all before and all after Jesus Christ was saying yesterday today and forever we're going to hurt it don't forgive me about that anybody said the new birth is the most important thing in your life foreign that I needed something move on brother here's to what matters all right let's end this crack off a little bit all right father in the name of Jesus Christ we send this for our coffee to the back of our Lord about this stomach problem we pray it all will be well we thank you in Jesus name amen I don't know in the mulberry tree let's give them a crack law and to take with them and let's believe all is well father in the name of Jesus Christ we send his prayer cloth with our sister Lord and our brother and she'll take care of them on a vacation trip Lord and all we will not to just them but everybody with them we love you and we thank you in Jesus name again about what the doctor told her that he'd hope that when he got to be 76 that he had a heart like hers what thank God thank God he takes care of us pray one for another three things brother
