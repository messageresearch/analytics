[25:14] around and whenever they got ready to
[25:17] have service well there was just one old
[25:19] sheep herder came into town and came to
[25:21] the meeting and so uh the preacher stood
[25:25] around nobody else come you know he
[25:26] talked to that old farmer and Rancher
[25:29] and said well I guess we can't have a

[25:34] he said you know if I go out to feed my
[25:36] sheep and there just one old sheep comes

[28:07] brother Luke chap 2 and verse 41 now his
[28:12] parents went to Jerusalem every year at
[28:15] the Feast of Passover and when he was 12
[28:18] years old they went up to Jerusalem
[28:21] after the custom of the feast and when
[28:23] they had fulfilled the
[28:25] days notice it didn't say the p Passover
[28:28] was fulfilled right right right when
[28:30] they had fulfilled the
[28:33] days
[28:35] see as they returned the child jesus
[28:38] carried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph
[28:41] and his mother knew not of it but they
[28:44] supposing him to have been in the
[28:46] company went a Day's Journey and they
[28:49] sought him among their kin folks and
[28:53] acquaintance and when they found him not
[28:55] they turned back again to Jerusalem
[28:58] seeking him
[29:00] Y and it came to pass that after 3 days
[29:05] amen must have been in the fourth if he
[29:08] after 3 days after 3 days right they
[29:12] found him right in the temple sitting in
[29:14] the midst of the doctors both hearing
[29:17] them and asking them questions and all
[29:21] that heard him were astonished at his
[29:24] understanding and answers and when they
[29:27] saw him they were amazed and his mother
[29:30] said unto him son why hast thou thus
[29:33] dealt with us Behold thy father and I
[29:36] have sought thee
[29:37] soring and he said unto them how unto
[29:41] them say Joseph and Mary both there
[29:43] probably and uh how is it that ye sought
[29:48] me wished ye not that I must be about my
[29:52] father's business they understood not
[29:54] the saying which he spake unto them and
[29:56] he went down with them and came came to
[29:58] Nazareth and was subject unto them but
[30:01] his mother kept all those these sayings
[30:04] in her heart and Jesus increased in
[30:07] wisdom and stature and in favor with God
[30:09] and man right now one more little
[30:11] portion of scripture I believe it's
[30:13] second Corinthians that I want and if
[30:17] I'm not mistaken it's verse 12 verse 7
[30:21] may be First Corinthians let's see here
[30:25] 127 uh
[30:28] yes 2 Corinthians maybe
[30:32] 12:7 uh this verse of scripture starts
[30:37] in be uh uh 2 Corinthians 12:7 this is
[30:41] one of the few verses in the Bible that
[30:43] begins and ends the same way and God
[30:46] doesn't use vain repetition right so
[30:49] he's trying to emphasize something here
[30:51] to us right
[30:54] notice and lest I should be exalted
[30:56] above measure
[30:58] it's the great Apostle Paul
[31:01] writing through the abundance of the
[31:05] revelations there was given to me a
[31:08] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[31:10] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[31:14] exalted above measure
[31:16] right and
[31:21] uh
[31:23] listen let's pray and uh just before
[31:26] we're seated Lord Jesus tonight we are
[31:30] asking once again that you will uh just
[31:34] add to Lord uh our understanding the
[31:40] eyes of our understanding might be
[31:41] enlightened and that we'd be able to
[31:43] come a little rung higher up Jacob's
[31:45] Ladder be drawn closer to thee climbing
[31:47] up the pyramid Mountain as it were Lord
[31:50] and God that when we leave the service
[31:53] this evening we would uh be able to say
[31:56] as they that walked with you on the road
[31:59] to amus did not our hearts burn within
[32:02] us as he spake to us along the way and
[32:05] opened unto us the scriptures help us
[32:07] Lord may you do the same because you are
[32:09] the same in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[32:13] amen God bless you may be
[32:15] seated tonight again we want to maybe
[32:18] just take another little part of what we
[32:21] had uh this
[32:23] morning uh up to
[32:26] the yes up to the fullness of the
[32:29] stature of Jesus Christ staying with the
[32:33] word amen and bringing that word to full
[32:36] maturity now the prophet of God taught
[32:39] us uh that there's only one reason for
[32:43] God's displeasure
[32:47] right have I got your attention right
[32:50] only one reason for God's displeasure
[32:53] with you as an individual or a group
[32:58] or church there's only one reason for
[33:00] God's displeasure with any individual
[33:03] you or me or anybody else and that is
[33:06] for you or I to leave the word right and
[33:11] there's only one
[33:12] remedy to regain his favor right and
[33:16] that is for you and I to come back to
[33:18] the
[33:19] word we read this morning from the
[33:21] message how can I overcome and we
[33:24] learned that there was only six in the
[33:27] days of John the Baptist is that what
[33:29] the prophet Tau us only six others
[33:31] offered their offerings and so forth
[33:33] made their sacrifices kept the ores
[33:36] thousands of them perhaps millions of
[33:38] them but these were the elected right
[33:40] amen these overcame right exactly six
[33:45] Overcomers in the days of John the
[33:48] Baptist now you don't overcome when
[33:50] you're passing notes and chew and
[33:52] Bubblegum and all these things in church
[33:54] if you want to be an overcomer you got
[33:55] to come to the word and let the word
[33:58] come to you is that right and so if you
[34:01] will just uh help me
[34:04] now and the more you help me the faster
[34:07] you help me the faster I can preach and
[34:09] the faster we get done and not just
[34:11] we're not here just to get done but we
[34:13] want to get somewhere is that right get
[34:15] get uh you know and um uh find the
[34:20] expression of the word find the
[34:22] expression of the spirit what is needful
[34:24] as we said this morning it has to be a
[34:26] word in season that has never been in
[34:29] season before amen and so let's uh pray
[34:34] that the Lord would just speak to us I
[34:36] need him to speak to me amen right I
[34:39] unless he speaks to me I can't speak to
[34:41] you that's right and so if we have the
[34:43] right attitude and approach to the
[34:45] service I know you might be a little bit
[34:46] tired and so forth but we don't want to
[34:48] entertain that is that right we want to
[34:51] just uh just do our very best put our
[34:54] best foot forward and let the Lord speak
[34:57] to us
[34:58] right
[34:59] now
[35:00] remember every true and fresh Revival
[35:04] comes when men and women have gotten
[35:07] back to the word of God for their
[35:09] age Joseph and Mary left the word right
[35:15] Joseph and Mary were elected and
[35:18] ordained to bring the word to maturity
[35:21] but instead of bringing that word to
[35:23] maturity they left the word that's right
[35:26] when the word itself was coming right to
[35:28] maturity amen the most important time
[35:32] for them to stick with the word right
[35:35] and they had left the word right now
[35:38] listen you don't have to
[35:41] leave 100% of the word all you have to
[35:44] do is leave one
[35:45] word Mary uh uh Eve excuse me did not
[35:51] doubt or misbelieve a whole sentence
[35:54] right or paragraph yeah she only
[35:58] miss one word right amen and if God put
[36:03] Adam and Eve out of the
[36:04] garden for misbelieving or disobeying
[36:08] one word he is God and he won't let you
[36:12] and I go back in right exactly
[36:16] disobeying one word we must come by the
[36:20] way of the word amen amen God's God
[36:24] right he's no respect of
[36:25] persons and so I want to emphasize this
[36:30] tonight staying with every word and
[36:34] letting that word bring us to
[36:37] maturity see it's not you bringing the
[36:39] word to maturity so much as it is
[36:42] letting that
[36:44] word see bring you right and me to its
[36:49] maturity and so we see
[36:52] that
[36:53] uh I want to just read a little
[36:55] something here to you from the church
[36:57] book that comes to
[36:59] me I think I have it marked here
[37:02] somewhere yes page
[37:05] 251 and um then I want to say something
[37:09] uh very positive about the five-fold
[37:11] ministry because a lot of people take
[37:14] this quotation here and they say
[37:16] something negative about the five
[37:18] Ministry or try to do away with it but
[37:20] listen to
[37:22] this is it uh it is not enough that he
[37:27] is a son Associated himself with the
[37:28] whole
[37:30] church which we saw when he was sent
[37:32] seen standing amongst the seven golden
[37:34] lampstands nor is it even enough that we
[37:38] see the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4
[37:41] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[37:44] and pastors for in each age the church
[37:47] goes
[37:48] astray and it's not just the leoty but
[37:52] the clergy group shepherds are wrong as
[37:56] well as sheep
[37:58] right then God brings himself on the
[38:02] scene right as the chief Shepherd glory
[38:07] in the ministries of these seven men to
[38:11] lead his people back to the truth and
[38:14] the Abundant power of that truth amen
[38:18] God is in his people all of his people
[38:21] for If any man had not the spirit of
[38:23] Christ he is none of his I just read a
[38:25] portion you get the the context of that
[38:27] if you'd like but now
[38:30] see uh God wants us to stay with the
[38:34] word and here myself as a shepherd and a
[38:37] minister God forbid that I'd ever say
[38:40] anything to reflect on that because
[38:43] that's uh you know it one of the most
[38:46] profound things that I ever thought of
[38:48] or could ever see and I seen it years
[38:51] ago is how that somebody claiming to be
[38:53] a preacher part of the fivefold ministry
[38:56] get up and suggest there is no such a
[38:58] thing talk about a self- disputing
[39:02] preacher self- condemning message yeah
[39:05] you know what I'm saying that that we
[39:07] don't need none anymore oh my and you
[39:11] know I I was reminded again what the
[39:13] prophet said in question answers on the
[39:15] seals brother Brenham he asked the
[39:17] question should the would the bride have
[39:19] a Ministry before the Rapture he said
[39:21] why sure that's what's taking place
[39:24] right now amen it consists of Apostles
[39:26] prophets evangelist pastors and teachers
[39:29] is that right but it' be so simple he
[39:31] said amen now so as we see that uh this
[39:37] we want to acknowledge that shepherds
[39:39] are wrong as well as sheep right okay
[39:42] amen and th so we see that God brings
[39:47] himself on the scene through the
[39:50] ministry of these seven Messengers right
[39:52] right well if the seven Messengers have
[39:54] come and gone God must have come in uh
[39:58] as the chief Shepherd y right is that
[40:01] right as I said this morning and we were
[40:04] reminded of what taking place in 1933
[40:07] when the pillar fire moved down and the
[40:10] Holy Spirit said as John the Baptist was
[40:13] sent to forun my first coming your
[40:15] ministry your message however you want
[40:16] to say it was sent to forerun the second
[40:19] coming then John the Baptist could not
[40:23] be taken off the scene until Christ was
[40:25] introduced right we are in a repeat of
[40:28] that same thing in this day and unless
[40:31] we see that and realize that we're not
[40:34] walking in the light of the Revelation
[40:36] that's right we've got to realize the
[40:38] full word has been birthed back into
[40:40] manifestation again today as it was
[40:43] 2,000 years ago and that it is coming to
[40:46] maturity right when this word begin to
[40:48] come to maturity
[40:51] then uh we see that Joseph and Mary got
[40:54] out of Step a little bit but they got
[40:56] back in life
[40:58] amen you know the church had left the
[41:01] word down through the Dark
[41:03] Ages and when it that's why it went into
[41:05] darkness right but after Luther after
[41:08] Wesley after Pentecost we found the word
[41:12] restored after 3 days and now we know
[41:16] the full word has been birthed back into
[41:19] full manifestation again and God has
[41:22] personified Jesus Christ has personified
[41:25] himself Among Us that's right amen amen
[41:28] right oh my see
[41:32] now brother Brenham said no man will
[41:36] ever reach the plane that Jesus reached
[41:39] I've got the quote right here if you
[41:40] want to read it no and he says it twice
[41:43] in the same paragraph in him was the
[41:45] fullness of the godhead bodily right he
[41:47] said you receive it by measure is that
[41:50] right and even himself he said I I
[41:53] receive it you and I receive it by
[41:55] measure but Christ without measure amen
[41:57] is that right amen but see we see the
[42:02] manifestation of the alpha and omega
[42:04] ministry and it was Jesus Christ
[42:07] manifesting through these seven
[42:10] Messengers re bringing himself on the
[42:12] scene as the chief Shepherd first to
[42:15] appear and then to come see the
[42:17] appearing of the Lord right amen and he
[42:21] appears uh and has appeared and uh we
[42:25] see then in the last few years this
[42:29] manifestation to bring the church to
[42:31] full maturity
[42:34] now we look at
[42:36] Paul Paul was an overcomer in his age
[42:41] you believe that had to be the first
[42:43] church Angel messenger amen but here the
[42:45] great Apostle Paul before he met Christ
[42:49] he had got exalted above mejor oh he was
[42:51] riding a high house and he was
[42:54] persecuting the true church amen and
[42:57] breathing out threatenings against the
[42:59] true church oh brother he'd kill
[43:01] everybody get in his hands on you know
[43:03] or having stoned or putting jail or
[43:05] something and he's seeking more power
[43:06] and more Authority CU he was religious
[43:09] and he was very zealous about his
[43:11] religion right and these a bunch of
[43:13] Cults Jesus name Cults and all these he
[43:17] was getting rid of them he's trying his
[43:18] best to scatter them is that right God
[43:20] was allowing Paul to do it true yeah
[43:23] that's right it was fulfilling the
[43:25] program of God right
[43:27] sure it was Amen Let and the more he
[43:30] scattered him the more the the word went
[43:32] out like like
[43:34] wart is that right right but while Paul
[43:37] was on his road down to Damascus you
[43:39] know what he ran into the pillar
[43:41] fire and U it's hard for thee to kick
[43:44] against the Pricks why persecutest thou
[43:47] me Saul Saul and he got a name change
[43:51] and God took the fight out of Paul right
[43:54] he blinded him for three days exactly y
[43:57] knocked him off his feet talk about
[43:59] humbling him and we're reminded how then
[44:02] concerning that brother bam said anytime
[44:04] you and I are you awake everybody awake
[44:07] rise above that Damascus dust you raise
[44:09] above God that's right amen the Latin
[44:13] word
[44:14] for uh humble the English word humble
[44:18] comes from the Latin word humus yeah
[44:21] which means
[44:24] dust dust y dust Thou Art Y and dust
[44:29] thou returnest
[44:32] amen and you should never forget that
[44:34] amen see and so we see
[44:38] that Paul even after he was converted by
[44:43] the abundance of these true Revelations
[44:46] he wasn't receiving false Revelations
[44:48] right Paul was receiving true
[44:50] Revelations but because he was receiving
[44:52] so many of them yeah
[44:55] abundance through the abundance of the
[44:57] revelations he was having a tendency to
[45:00] be exalted above measure
[45:02] yeah now Satan was perfect in the day
[45:06] was created how many knows
[45:07] that the angel CH that cover God's
[45:11] right-and man to fellowship with brother
[45:12] B said coequal with God in every respect
[45:15] except to be able to create God wouldn't
[45:16] let he was an archangel all Revelation
[45:20] went through him handed down to the
[45:22] angels y he trafficked trafficked in
[45:25] Revelation y he wasn't a drug trafficker
[45:28] he trafficked in Revelation amen but
[45:31] through the abundance of those
[45:32] Revelations God allowed him to get
[45:34] exalted above measure right y right Lord
[45:38] and he got a false Revelation that he
[45:40] wanted a false notion of is our and he
[45:44] said I'll exalt my throne above the
[45:45] stars of God listen brothers and sisters
[45:48] may we never try to exalt ourself above
[45:51] these Seven Stars this message come from
[45:55] God God has brought him on the scene
[45:57] through these Messengers see right and
[46:00] don't you ever think to exalt yourself
[46:03] above the prophet I want you to see
[46:04] something here this evening six
[46:06] Overcomers in the days of John the
[46:08] Baptist and you'll notice how the word
[46:10] had to correct Joseph and Mary yeah and
[46:12] the word had to correct
[46:15] Zachariah you ever stop thinking about
[46:17] that brother brandham said Zachariah was
[46:19] praying for a child yeah zachar
[46:22] Elizabeth was but she was old and Barren
[46:25] yeah and God heard his cry that that
[46:29] Gabriel said your prayer has been heard
[46:30] God heard his heard him and now remember
[46:33] he's one of the Overcomers when God
[46:35] calls a pastor he calls his wife with
[46:36] him so Elizabeth is identified in the
[46:38] ministry with him zachari and Elizabeth
[46:41] all
[46:42] right and uh Joseph and Mary a type of
[46:45] the leoty natural people Carpenter right
[46:48] zachari and Elizabeth a type of the
[46:51] ministry fivefold see but here's an and
[46:55] Sime Simeon and
[46:57] prophet and Prophet as brother R said is
[46:59] that right but it's Christ and the
[47:01] church Christ and the church but three
[47:03] categories of these six see uh three
[47:07] categories and all each one of those
[47:09] categories is a type of Christ in the
[47:11] church see me and Anna as you study that
[47:13] oh it's beautiful right am and uh but we
[47:16] see here that the word had to correct
[47:20] Joseph and Mary and here we
[47:23] see Zachariah you know what he was
[47:27] he was a message
[47:29] preacher yeah that's right he was a
[47:31] message preacher because he receiv
[47:33] received the message the same Angelic
[47:35] visit visitor the same messenger the
[47:38] same Angel messenger that went to Mary
[47:41] right 6 months earlier had going to
[47:43] Zechariah right that's right and by the
[47:46] time Mary got the word from the angel
[47:48] Zachariah was
[47:50] dumb Zachariah was D for at least nine
[47:54] months a minister in the House of God
[47:58] and he remained of course once he
[48:00] finished up his ministration there
[48:01] probably pretty quick after he spitten
[48:03] dumb he went home and Elizabeth
[48:06] conceived but you see he questioned the
[48:09] message of the hour that's right he he
[48:12] doubted it it looked kind of like Mary
[48:14] had questioned but Angel the Lord knows
[48:17] the heart she wasn't doubting she didn't
[48:19] say how can this be sing I don't know
[48:21] man but uh the Lord knew her heart and
[48:26] he just explained to her how it be the
[48:27] Holy Ghost but when it come to Zechariah
[48:29] now here he's been praying for it and
[48:33] God answers his
[48:35] prayer and hear the Angelic visitation
[48:38] tells him what he's going to do and
[48:39] still doubted it exactly how can this be
[48:43] I'm old and Elizabeth's
[48:45] old you know he was doubting a little
[48:48] bit that's okay to
[48:50] doubt if you doubt your doubts right
[48:57] it's okay down a little bit if you just
[48:59] doubt your doubts see that's what
[49:01] brother brand quoted brother bossworth
[49:03] it must be okay okay yeah and so but see
[49:07] he literally doubted and so Gabriel said
[49:10] I tell you what I I'm I'm Gabriel I come
[49:13] right from the presence of God you're
[49:14] doubting my word oh I'll just give you a
[49:16] sign in you want a sign you can't just
[49:19] take it like me saying I'm going to give
[49:20] you a sign you'll be smitten dumb you
[49:23] won't be able to to speak a word until
[49:26] my words have made fullfill cuz you
[49:28] doubted my word right right amen right a
[49:32] dumb message preacher
[49:36] right we got a lot of them thank you
[49:38] Lord I'm glad we got a few that's got
[49:40] their mouth
[49:42] open amen they might slobber like a
[49:45] horse eating tall Clover or something
[49:46] like that sometimes you know and if you
[49:49] sit on the front row you might get
[49:51] baptized or
[49:54] sprinkled but at least they got the
[49:56] mouth that can make some kind of noise
[49:58] but he couldn't make he couldn't speak a
[50:00] word right that's right all he could do
[50:02] is just
[50:05] write you know he just it all had to be
[50:09] in in symbol form letter form whatever
[50:11] he tried to get across is that right
[50:14] right he didn't have the spoken word
[50:16] right exactly he didn't right
[50:21] but
[50:23] amen when he no longer wanted to call
[50:25] the church after his name but the name
[50:28] that Gabriel gave him to call him right
[50:30] they wanted to call him Zachariah or
[50:33] something like that he said no sir his
[50:35] name's going to be John soon as he
[50:37] obeyed the message and acted on the word
[50:40] he the first case of Divine Healing in
[50:42] the New Testament that I know of right
[50:45] in the house of God right amen when they
[50:48] he'd come back see right when he was
[50:50] smitten dumb his administration was
[50:52] finished he went home and the word of
[50:55] the Lord was fulfilled y Elizabeth
[50:57] conceived did you ever stop to think
[51:00] Zachariah might have been there this
[51:02] morning we had a
[51:04] Mary going down to the house of
[51:08] Elizabeth her
[51:11] cousin and there's
[51:15] Zachariah and here's Jesus and here's
[51:17] John the Baptist yeah oh my Zachariah
[51:22] maybe couldn't enter into the Revival
[51:23] like them women
[51:24] could didn't hear him shout too much
[51:27] there no record of him saying a thing
[51:30] exactly he's dumb during that time
[51:32] remember right right oh my but we see
[51:36] when the word of the Lord was fulfilled
[51:38] and he obeyed the word wrote the word oh
[51:43] his tongue was loosed you talk about a
[51:44] shou and good time they had there oh my
[51:49] amen my at the naming of the
[51:53] Prophet M see but but see no where I
[51:58] just said that to say this I'm not
[52:00] suggesting that Simeon and Anna now
[52:04] didn't need a little correction in their
[52:06] life I'm sure the Holy Spirit corrected
[52:07] them but you don't find in the Bible
[52:09] where the word corrected the prophet
[52:11] right
[52:13] right brother Ram said when a major
[52:15] prophet comes on the scene nobody judges
[52:17] him right you don't have to correct him
[52:19] now five-fold Ministry Prophet or
[52:21] something like that you know gift of
[52:22] Prophecy supposed to be judged for it
[52:24] comes to the church to my understand
[52:26] standing a church amen not only the
[52:29] person who gives the message uh where
[52:32] it's tongues or prophecy whatever is
[52:33] supposed to be written down and then U
[52:36] the two or three judges they put their
[52:38] name on it too and then let the pastor
[52:40] read it he don't have to question it
[52:41] just read it but then if it don't come
[52:43] to pass not the pastor's fault right but
[52:46] that man who gave the message and the
[52:48] man who interpreted and the two or three
[52:51] that were supposed to have the wisdom to
[52:53] judge it they all got a lineing spirit
[52:56] on them
[52:57] let him repent before we get anything
[52:59] else from him is that what he taught
[53:01] sure as Church order but you don't judge
[53:04] the major prophet nobody he don't stand
[53:06] in front of nobody exactly and let me
[53:08] tell you something I just said that to
[53:09] say this God didn't
[53:11] send me to correct brother brandham
[53:14] that's right he didn't send the fivefold
[53:17] ministry to correct the major prophet
[53:19] but the other way around he sent the
[53:21] prophet to correct me do you believe
[53:23] that oh yes Moses had to wash
[53:27] and the priesthood before they could
[53:29] Minister Moses was that prophet he had
[53:31] to wash and clothe that priesthood and
[53:35] we have to come under the opes of this
[53:38] word that's been birthed into full
[53:40] manifestation through the ministry of
[53:42] Malachi 4 that which is perfect is come
[53:46] the perfect interpretation of the word
[53:48] of God with the vine of indication oh
[53:50] what an hour we're living in amen listen
[53:52] think about this
[53:54] folks who then would have the the power
[53:57] of infallibility brother Brenham did not
[53:59] claim to be infallible but let me tell
[54:01] you something about the power of
[54:04] infallibility he asked that question who
[54:06] then would have the power of
[54:07] infallibility which we know would be
[54:09] necessary because this last age goes
[54:12] back to receiving the perfect word of
[54:15] God as it was perfectly given and
[54:18] perfectly understood in the days of St
[54:20] Paul exactly and he goes on and says now
[54:22] I'll tell you he'll have it he'll be a
[54:23] prophet right he'll be more thoroughly
[54:26] vind than any of the prophets from anoch
[54:28] forward cuz he's got to bring that word
[54:30] to full maturity oh my let me ask you
[54:34] this what good would it do for God to
[54:36] send us a perfect message if he didn't
[54:38] also give you a perfect understanding so
[54:40] your Revelation would be perfect God
[54:43] don't give no per uh imperfect
[54:45] Revelations he don't give immature
[54:49] Revelations but the Holy Spirit see
[54:51] brings us to that see perfect now he
[54:55] that is true right full Revelation as
[54:58] contrasted with partial Revelation
[55:00] rapturing Revelation that's the our we
[55:02] must mature to this place right see we
[55:05] want to see this Bride come up here to
[55:09] the fullness of the stature of Jesus
[55:11] Christ in full maturity this is what
[55:14] we're speaking on just for a little bit
[55:16] here now and then
[55:19] to being careful young or old man or
[55:23] woman lay person or Minister that we be
[55:26] not exalted above measure through the
[55:30] abundance of these Revelations because
[55:33] we're receiving the same Revelations
[55:35] that Paul received or something's wrong
[55:37] with us right and if he a great
[55:43] Apostle had a tendency to be exalted
[55:45] above measure what about you and I oh
[55:47] yeah right sure through the abundance of
[55:50] true Revelation right exactly Satan was
[55:53] exalted above measure is that right God
[55:56] allowed him you know to fall but he
[56:00] won't allow his elect to
[56:04] fall right that's why he has to Humble
[56:07] us that's why he has to crack the whip
[56:10] that's why he has to pull the rug out
[56:11] from under us some sometimes oh my my my
[56:17] my we don't want to be exalted above
[56:19] measure is that right that's right amen
[56:22] right brother just see how little you
[56:24] can be brother R said right don't see
[56:26] how big you can be right and if you
[56:28] can't say something good about somebody
[56:31] zip the lip you'd be better off like
[56:33] Zachariah is that right sure don't say
[56:35] anything at all right is that what we've
[56:37] been taught amen all right
[56:40] now so here in this now as we look at
[56:44] this we see how that the bride in this
[56:51] age has to come to a maturity right and
[56:56] um
[57:00] uh here in Sturgis Michigan in 56 they
[57:04] was talking
[57:06] about some Theologian jumping on brother
[57:08] B said why the all the apostles any case
[57:12] that was brought to them they never
[57:13] failed a case they never missed a lick
[57:15] said uh let me see you do this let me
[57:18] see you do that I said wait a minute
[57:20] brother we're just in our infancy we're
[57:24] Rising don't worry right when we get all
[57:27] these Fanatics and unbelievers out of
[57:29] the way we'll move on up into Perfection
[57:32] after a while and you'll see signs and
[57:34] wonders but we're just babes crawling
[57:37] just give us a little while right now
[57:40] that was 56 yeah all
[57:44] right and
[57:46] uh
[57:48] then here in spiritual
[57:51] inspiration uh he says it again in 56
[57:57] uh and this man said well the disciples
[58:01] they always they never lost a case
[58:02] anybody they prayed for what about you
[58:04] and this that and the other brother B
[58:06] said well my eight-year-old daughter
[58:08] better not you better not ever ask her
[58:10] to tell her that she'll make you ashamed
[58:11] of yourself you don't know no more about
[58:13] the Bible than that that's a hard blow
[58:16] wasn't it talking to a
[58:18] theologian said why she knows better
[58:21] than that why what about the case when
[58:24] Jesus come down and the disciples
[58:27] one come to him with the um uh epilep
[58:31] epilepsy and and his disciples couldn't
[58:34] heal him and they had to bring him to
[58:35] Jesus I said what he said what about
[58:37] that and what about the time when Paul
[58:40] had to leave his buddy Luke 6ck right
[58:42] what about that you know and he said uh
[58:46] we're just in our infancy we're moving
[58:48] up and as quickly as we get you a bunch
[58:50] of formal Fanatics out of the way we'll
[58:53] be doing that see
[58:56] amen and but he was showing see that the
[58:59] bride was still somewhat in its infancy
[59:02] yeah and I want you to see this further
[59:05] in the message communion then
[59:08] 62 we see that the astronomers are
[59:11] predicting something in the early part
[59:14] of the first of the month now this is
[59:16] February of 1962
[59:19] okay beginning on the 2 or the fifth or
[59:24] somewhere along this month the Indian
[59:27] astronomers predict that the world would
[59:29] blow to pieces and the American
[59:31] newspapers make fun of it I do not
[59:33] believe the world's going to blow to
[59:35] Pieces but I do say it's wrong to make
[59:37] fun of it because something's fixing to
[59:40] happen one of these days something
[59:41] similar to that and when the five
[59:44] planets Mars Jupiter and Venus and so
[59:47] forth comes into their uh they never did
[59:51] it oh they claim maybe
[59:55] 25,000 years ago but who was back there
[59:58] to know it see and I predict that this
[1:00:03] has a spiritual application right all
[1:00:05] right now watch this where was the first
[1:00:08] Bible written in the stars right that
[1:00:10] right now here's a prophet on Earth I
[1:00:12] don't suggest you try to do this because
[1:00:14] we got a greater Bible today and not so
[1:00:17] much that's greater but it's a different
[1:00:19] order so we don't want to go back into
[1:00:21] astrology but here's the prophet of God
[1:00:23] on Earth can inter
[1:00:26] what's taking place in the Heavens to us
[1:00:29] all right I predict that this has a
[1:00:32] spiritual application I believe it's the
[1:00:35] coming of the issue of God right now if
[1:00:41] you're going to have a a word to come to
[1:00:44] maturity first you've got to have the
[1:00:47] hemoglobin yeah right you got to have a
[1:00:49] conception you got to have a birth right
[1:00:52] you before you can have an infant is
[1:00:54] that right an infant
[1:00:56] so the issue of God is the hemoglobin of
[1:00:59] God and the hemoglobin of God is the
[1:01:01] word of God in the beginning was the
[1:01:03] word and the word is with God the Word
[1:01:04] was God now so we see then that he's
[1:01:09] saying I believe it's the coming in of
[1:01:11] the issue of
[1:01:13] God that the great revelation of the
[1:01:16] word will be open during this time Glory
[1:01:19] y then he goes on see and and remember
[1:01:23] that great message he
[1:01:24] preached uh s is this the time right
[1:01:28] right see before the seals was open he
[1:01:30] seen that and he he predicted it right
[1:01:34] actually later he calls it a prophecy
[1:01:36] and when he brought it he brought it in
[1:01:39] the form of a question right sir is this
[1:01:41] a time but later he called into prophecy
[1:01:44] for those who could catch it who had the
[1:01:46] answer they claim it was three stars
[1:01:50] back to this quote now in communion
[1:01:53] 62 uh
[1:01:56] remember they claim it was three stars
[1:01:58] came into the orbit when Jesus was born
[1:02:02] and this is five yeah right five is
[1:02:06] Grace the number of Grace Three is the
[1:02:08] number of perfection five is the number
[1:02:10] of Grace j s s g r a c e f a i t h and
[1:02:13] so forth number of Grace God ever sends
[1:02:17] his power to the church it'll be his
[1:02:19] grace amen It Won't Be The Obedience of
[1:02:23] the people exactly
[1:02:26] oh that's not to suggest you go out and
[1:02:28] disobey he's not saying that at all no
[1:02:31] and Isaiah said in the 40th chapter oh I
[1:02:35] was just reading that right praying and
[1:02:38] preparing here last week brother Dale
[1:02:40] for these Services right cry to my
[1:02:43] people and tell her her Warfare is
[1:02:45] accomplished her sins have been paid
[1:02:47] double for her she's pardoned that's
[1:02:50] what I Come To Tell You Folks it's
[1:02:52] finished it's finished it it you know
[1:02:56] the the actually the marriage license
[1:02:58] and the whole Plan of Redemption and the
[1:03:00] book The Abstract title lead is put back
[1:03:02] in your hand now and it's open to for
[1:03:05] you to see your name in it right it's
[1:03:07] finished see we just got to accept it
[1:03:09] and believe it amen Isaiah said to uh
[1:03:12] chapter 4 how to cry to Jerusalem that
[1:03:14] her Warfare was over yet she was guilty
[1:03:17] of ID
[1:03:18] idolatry but it was God's grace that was
[1:03:21] sending it right God sends anything to
[1:03:24] us it'll be his grace and not merits
[1:03:26] right right so it may mean something I
[1:03:31] predict that there will be a change I
[1:03:33] don't know what it will be but I believe
[1:03:35] it's fixing to happen we're on right on
[1:03:37] the eve of it now and if any man hungers
[1:03:40] let him come into me and thirst If any
[1:03:41] man thirsty let him come un to Christ he
[1:03:44] quenches The Thirst he is the satisfier

[1:06:25] to fall on her right she's taking form
[1:06:29] right of Bride for the bridegroom
[1:06:33] amen that three stars meant his
[1:06:37] Perfection of the heavenly father of the
[1:06:39] Trinity coming into one on earth Among
[1:06:41] Us God's office becoming one office
[1:06:44] 2,000 years ago what happened now what
[1:06:47] happened now it's the Church of the
[1:06:49] Living God coming together under the
[1:06:51] word of God and the astronomic heavens
[1:06:55] Heaven is announcing her
[1:06:59] approach three stars announced his
[1:07:02] approach three becoming lined up they
[1:07:04] just saw one because he was in line with
[1:07:07] the earth now they just see one again
[1:07:09] when they really lined up but it's
[1:07:11] announcing her
[1:07:14] approach three for the bridegroom and
[1:07:18] five for the bride announcing her
[1:07:20] approach what is it it's the coming of
[1:07:23] the Lord right see the out Al and the
[1:07:26] Omega the bride and the bridegroom
[1:07:29] Christ the Creator the beginning of the
[1:07:32] creation creating himself a bride amen
[1:07:35] that's right amen might not believe that
[1:07:38] but it's the word just the same yes sir
[1:07:40] amen glory
[1:07:42] now what's
[1:07:45] happening
[1:07:47] um I I I might say this friends the
[1:07:50] church is coming forth God's going to
[1:07:52] have a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:07:55] and she's predestinated God said so he
[1:07:58] would have it that makes it
[1:08:01] right who's a member I don't know I'm
[1:08:04] trusting to be myself I'm trusting you
[1:08:07] are a member but he's going to have a
[1:08:10] body without spot and wrinkle and I
[1:08:13] believe that these latterday signs and
[1:08:16] things that's
[1:08:17] happening every one of them is
[1:08:21] peeling together like bouncy uh to show
[1:08:25] that Christ is ready to come for his
[1:08:28] bride it's God in his word made manifest
[1:08:32] in a man a perfect man so if God and His
[1:08:38] word coming again making himself
[1:08:41] manifested in a bride
[1:08:43] exact
[1:08:45] not will do like Eve did hi bre it to
[1:08:50] something else but the unadulterated
[1:08:53] word of God will be be born in into the
[1:08:55] church into that church and she'll stand
[1:08:58] like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit
[1:09:02] anointing in his word amen I believe
[1:09:06] it's the announcement
[1:09:08] now right oh my
[1:09:12] Hallelujah isn't that wonderful to
[1:09:14] realize right amen skip on down here
[1:09:17] just a little bit
[1:09:21] now what is it now we see see that when
[1:09:26] Jesus rode into
[1:09:30] Jerusalem he was introducing himself as
[1:09:34] the
[1:09:35] king the
[1:09:39] Creator he didn't go out and steal a
[1:09:42] horse he didn't rent a
[1:09:44] horse and he wasn't no horse thief and
[1:09:47] he wasn't teaching his disciples to be a
[1:09:49] horse thief but he was obeying what the
[1:09:51] father showed him and he was presenting
[1:09:53] himself as the owner of the
[1:09:55] horse the cattle on a thousand hills
[1:09:58] belong to him all the donkeys belong to
[1:10:00] him and he just said go get him right he
[1:10:03] showing himself he's exercising his
[1:10:06] authority of as a king and he he gets
[1:10:09] his disciples and the Bible says see
[1:10:12] Zechariah
[1:10:14] 9:9 behold th King cometh riding on an
[1:10:18] ass The Cult of full of an ass and so
[1:10:19] forth and meek and lowely brother BR
[1:10:22] said tradition tells us it's a white
[1:10:24] donkey that he wrote on foreshadowing
[1:10:27] how he was going to come riding on a
[1:10:29] white charger in the end time
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:33] amen oh my see Revelations see I ain't
[1:10:38] got no pet Doctrine or anything so don't
[1:10:40] don't anybody get scared but see it was
[1:10:43] foreshadowing something to us you
[1:10:45] understand what I'm saying foreshadowing
[1:10:47] something to us there amen and uh in
[1:10:51] that then
[1:10:55] see coming first as a lamb coming second
[1:10:59] as a lion is that right right EXA the
[1:11:03] second the first coming and the second
[1:11:05] coming first coming to be the
[1:11:08] sacrifice then coming see to be the
[1:11:13] judge the lion of the tribe of
[1:11:16] Judah bringing an
[1:11:19] indictment against the ungodly that
[1:11:22] reject the message of their day right
[1:11:24] exactly see they reject the blood right
[1:11:26] Mercy's extended y Mercy burn nothing
[1:11:29] left but judgment amen see right that's
[1:11:32] why he said I indict this generation for
[1:11:34] the second crucifixion because the full
[1:11:36] word had been birthed into manifestation
[1:11:38] again and rejected once the seals was
[1:11:39] opened the full word right he's
[1:11:42] predicting it here and we see it coming
[1:11:46] see and
[1:11:49] um me just
[1:11:53] uh hit this a note here
[1:11:56] from the church age book said no for in
[1:11:58] every age the church has been governed
[1:12:00] by hierarchy a priesthood and Apostolic
[1:12:04] secession yeah closing the door of mercy
[1:12:08] and Grace To whom it will and instead of
[1:12:10] assuming the love and responsibility of
[1:12:13] the church it has with mercenary lust
[1:12:17] prayed upon her and destroyed her the
[1:12:21] clergy lived in luxury while the poor
[1:12:23] Church fed on the husk of abuse yeah now
[1:12:27] then he goes on I'm skipping down a
[1:12:29] little bit
[1:12:30] here but um he shows how
[1:12:33] that every denomination has the same
[1:12:37] Spirit every denomination swears that it
[1:12:39] has the key to the government of
[1:12:43] Christ
[1:12:45] uh uh government of the church every
[1:12:48] denomination claims to open the door but
[1:12:50] that is not true it is Jesus alone he
[1:12:54] sets the members in the body he endows
[1:12:56] them with their Ministries he puts the
[1:12:59] gifts at her disposal he cares for her
[1:13:02] he guides her she is his sole property
[1:13:06] and he has no other one but her right
[1:13:10] amen if the denomination send you let
[1:13:13] him take care of you but if God sends
[1:13:15] you he'll provide for you he has no one
[1:13:18] but
[1:13:19] her God's whole purpose is the church he
[1:13:22] said in the message knoweth is not
[1:13:23] knoweth it not his whole purpose purpose
[1:13:26] now see this three-fold purpose of God
[1:13:28] revealed he preached the opening of the
[1:13:30] seals uh in March and then here he comes
[1:13:33] back in in in July the seventh month
[1:13:35] Christ the mystery it's just like a
[1:13:37] continuation of the seventh seal and he
[1:13:40] talks about that great secret amen it
[1:13:42] was once hid in the back part of God's
[1:13:44] mind he said but now in the heart of his
[1:13:47] believing children right down into the
[1:13:50] church oh made known see and he said uh
[1:13:54] it's
[1:13:55] in every type that's in the Bible what
[1:13:58] is it it's the coming of the Lord Glory
[1:14:00] see it's that great climax it's that
[1:14:02] thing that Jesus said no man knoweth y
[1:14:05] right save the father only not even the
[1:14:07] son at that time see right oh my now you
[1:14:12] all know the seventh seal uh any mystery
[1:14:16] has a element or any you know uh of uh
[1:14:20] mystery to it despite the Revelation
[1:14:22] thereof and so
[1:14:25] part of this uh seventh seal see the
[1:14:30] activity is taking place on Earth right
[1:14:32] that's why one of the reason why there's
[1:14:33] silence in heaven the activity is down
[1:14:35] here amen see now St John 3 here he is
[1:14:41] on
[1:14:41] Earth standing on the roof rooftop
[1:14:44] talking to to uh
[1:14:47] Nicodemus and
[1:14:49] said uh no man ascendeth up up into
[1:14:51] heaven save he who come down from heaven
[1:14:53] even the son of man who is now in heaven
[1:14:56] and here he is standing on Earth yeah
[1:14:58] brother BR said I put that riddle before
[1:15:00] my church yeah said showed that he was
[1:15:04] the omnipresent God Amen am that's right
[1:15:08] oh my amen how is he here then he's here
[1:15:11] in word form he's here in spirit form
[1:15:15] amen he was in body form then but today
[1:15:17] his body is the bride but we'll meet him
[1:15:19] in the body form in the air oh how
[1:15:23] wonderful see kind just changed back
[1:15:25] around a little bit today to hide
[1:15:27] yourself from the eyes of the wise and
[1:15:28] prent see morphia God masking himself in
[1:15:33] uh the second Eve way the prophet called
[1:15:35] us the second Eve the bride but this eve
[1:15:37] will not be deceived she will come to
[1:15:39] this maturity that she's ordained to
[1:15:42] come to oh my she'll stay with the word
[1:15:46] Now Eve see now just one word now I I
[1:15:51] had some other little quotes here but
[1:15:53] maybe the Lord uh is leading in another
[1:15:56] littleit different direction I'm just
[1:15:57] going to paraphrase some things here and
[1:16:00] then you search it out but in the
[1:16:02] message Harvest Time okay in the message
[1:16:05] Harvest Time brother Brenham said that
[1:16:07] you don't have to get this I'm just
[1:16:09] going to throw it back behind me here uh
[1:16:11] brother brandom said that man's Eternal
[1:16:15] destination is determined right there's
[1:16:18] where it's determined by one word right
[1:16:21] right am
[1:16:25] I have a little section of
[1:16:28] chain and I've got a weak Link in it you
[1:16:31] just cut it and then just have a link in
[1:16:33] the middle you know and then when you
[1:16:34] pull it it'll come apart and I'll being
[1:16:38] overseas and different places I'll use
[1:16:40] that chain and have my interpreter hold
[1:16:43] the other end of it I said now you brace
[1:16:44] yourself maybe sometimes the platform
[1:16:47] will be 3 4 foot high and I'll swing out
[1:16:49] over the platform holding that chain
[1:16:51] yeah I said now remember as the prophet
[1:16:55] said your soul is hanging over Hell by
[1:16:58] the chain of God's word and no chain is
[1:17:02] any stronger than its weakest
[1:17:05] link one word is all Eve missed right
[1:17:09] exactly amen what am I saying in order
[1:17:12] for you to come to full maturity you got
[1:17:14] to stay with the word and if you ever
[1:17:16] left the word you better come back to it
[1:17:19] is that right amen you got to Mary and
[1:17:21] Joseph did in order to bring that see he
[1:17:23] was just 12 years old he had some more
[1:17:25] maturing to do and they had a lot more
[1:17:27] maturing to do too we we heard Mary this
[1:17:29] morning said she had a lot more maturing
[1:17:31] to do is that right she had to she had
[1:17:34] to go to the cross with Jesus she had to
[1:17:37] go to Pentecost right amen with John
[1:17:40] right that Jesus put her under the
[1:17:41] headship of John then she had to go over
[1:17:45] to the church of Ephesus and help John
[1:17:47] get the word compiled oh my bringing
[1:17:51] that word SE to
[1:17:52] maturity but the emphasis on the word
[1:17:55] watering them camels you know it's going
[1:17:57] to carry her that's right oh my
[1:18:04] see are you still with
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:08] me oh my what an hour to be living in
[1:18:11] amen see now I'm just going to refer to
[1:18:14] some of these things and you can search
[1:18:15] it maybe if nothing else I'll wh your
[1:18:17] appetite when I paraphrase something uh
[1:18:20] that means I'm not quoting it verbatim
[1:18:22] but you'll find the same truth you
[1:18:24] understand be saying the same thing
[1:18:25] maybe in a different way right okay but
[1:18:28] you go search it
[1:18:29] out now here Jesus coming
[1:18:33] in and uh uh he had the disciples get
[1:18:37] this little uh donkey that had never
[1:18:41] been rode on by man before right oh the

[1:20:50] little bit higher than donkey he stayed
[1:20:51] humble donkey didn't have horse sits and
[1:20:54] he sure didn't have no human sense but

[1:21:58] word he was just you know try to get
[1:22:01] yourself out the way as he were the word
[1:22:04] right right see he wasn't exalted above
[1:22:07] measure
[1:22:10] right he stayed in his place abely amen
[1:22:17] amen but now the king riding in to his
[1:22:20] kingdom the Creator coming into his
[1:22:23] creation right amen what is the
[1:22:25] attraction that day in Jerusalem right
[1:22:28] oh who is this what's taking place
[1:22:30] brother BR say it's just a little bitty
[1:22:31] handful that recognized he was the
[1:22:33] Messiah right right rest of them was
[1:22:35] saying who is this what's going on just
[1:22:37] a little bit handful was saying
[1:22:40] hosana th son of David they recognize
[1:22:43] that history is being fulfilled
[1:22:44] Zechariah 9 and9 their King was coming
[1:22:48] right and all the rest of them just got
[1:22:49] infuriated and
[1:22:52] jealous is that right right
[1:22:55] and then the discip or the Pharisees and
[1:22:57] everything say tell them shut up don't
[1:23:00] you know that they're making too much
[1:23:02] noise here and they're calling you the
[1:23:03] king he said listen if I made them shut
[1:23:06] up the rocks and the mountains would
[1:23:08] start crying
[1:23:09] out why the rocks of the mountains would
[1:23:12] have to recognize their
[1:23:14] creator now we look at Joshua Joshua was
[1:23:18] a great man he had great faith and he
[1:23:19] made the sun stand still and the Moon
[1:23:21] Over the Valley agel but you know what
[1:23:24] blind
[1:23:26] barus off the beaten path brother B said
[1:23:29] Jesus did not hear the words of barus
[1:23:33] but he heard the noise barus did of
[1:23:36] Jesus and his disciples in the crowd
[1:23:38] coming yeah now it was a little
[1:23:40] different day not while he's on the
[1:23:43] donkey but Jesus one day was passing
[1:23:45] through there and z uh barus said who is
[1:23:48] that and they said why it's Jesus coming
[1:23:51] oh he begin to holler he's blind he's
[1:23:52] way off off the beaten path but he heard
[1:23:55] about it and he began to cry out in his
[1:23:58] heart and he began to cry out with his
[1:24:01] voice oh th son of David have mercy upon
[1:24:05] me oh th son of David have mercy upon me
[1:24:09] right nobody heard him Jesus somebody
[1:24:11] heard him but Jesus didn't brother man
[1:24:13] said but here they are all lot of noise
[1:24:16] way up on the road somewhere and all of
[1:24:18] a
[1:24:18] sudden Jesus Stood Still right everybody
[1:24:23] else is moving and but Jesus Stood Still
[1:24:25] amen only place in the Bible right Jesus
[1:24:30] Stood Still right exactly right now I
[1:24:34] want you to see something here Joshua
[1:24:38] stopped the
[1:24:40] creation by his faith right but barus by
[1:24:44] his faith stopped the Creator
[1:24:48] himself is that right
[1:24:51] am one stopped the Su in the other stop
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:56] here is the creator of the son himself
[1:24:58] and his faith stopped him and he got
[1:25:01] what he was wanting exactly is that
[1:25:04] right he got his healing got his
[1:25:07] Deliverance right oh my that was before
[1:25:09] the cross folks
[1:25:11] right if he could do that before the
[1:25:14] cross what can we do after the
[1:25:16] cross oh my before the atonement was
[1:25:19] even made what can we do with our little
[1:25:21] faith today amen see we need to see this
[1:25:24] word coming to full maturity that's
[1:25:27] right think about it what was the
[1:25:30] attraction down there in Jerusalem
[1:25:33] prophecy
[1:25:35] being fulfilled
[1:25:37] right and then brother Brandon preaching
[1:25:40] on this and he said what taking place
[1:25:42] what was the attraction on Mount Sunset
[1:25:44] right what was the attraction on Mount
[1:25:49] Sunset he said three years ago
[1:25:55] this was a
[1:25:57] prophecy but now it's history right
[1:26:00] right am
[1:26:03] hallelujah what happened on Mount Sunset
[1:26:06] right three years ago S as this the time
[1:26:10] he says that's what he's referring back
[1:26:11] to that message he preached serves is
[1:26:13] the time see that's where he proph
[1:26:16] predicted it prophesied it 3 years ago
[1:26:19] this was prophecy now it's history right
[1:26:22] what's history the prophecy has been
[1:26:25] fulfilled this day the scripture is
[1:26:28] fulfilled what was it Christ coming back
[1:26:31] into his church again
[1:26:33] hallelujah oh my yes coming back the
[1:26:37] full word birth in and manifestation
[1:26:40] right amen never a greater anointing he
[1:26:43] said all my Ministry than for the
[1:26:45] opening of this word the come on oh my
[1:26:49] right think about
[1:26:51] it something happened with God in
[1:26:54] Simplicity and humility opening those
[1:26:56] seals amen and they didn't even
[1:26:58] recognize what had happened right amen
[1:27:00] that's right think about it all my
[1:27:03] Ministry like uh Waters rivers of water
[1:27:07] singular Rivers plural different
[1:27:08] anointings one anointing for the healing
[1:27:10] of the sick first PLL second pull
[1:27:12] another anointing for the Discerning and
[1:27:14] the thoughts the in his heart great
[1:27:15] anointing but he said in all my Ministry
[1:27:17] I've never reached into a realm like
[1:27:19] this what's the third pull for the
[1:27:20] opening of the word the revealing of the
[1:27:22] word who is the word Christ is the word
[1:27:26] see oh bringing back the word see so you
[1:27:30] can have the word to overcome with
[1:27:33] letting that word bring you to maturity
[1:27:35] am amen see oh
[1:27:39] yes
[1:27:41] yes then he could say you know the bride
[1:27:47] has thus said the Lord that's right she
[1:27:49] has the word of the Lord she has the
[1:27:51] mind of Christ and she knows what he
[1:27:53] wants done with that word amen amen see
[1:27:56] it takes the mind of Christ to know what
[1:27:58] he wants done with the word of Christ
[1:28:00] right now in that also he put it like
[1:28:04] this we have the answer to the devil's
[1:28:09] question now I don't want to sound like
[1:28:11] a show off up here but if the prophet
[1:28:13] said we have the answer to the devil's
[1:28:16] question I want to identify with that
[1:28:18] we I want to identify with that we so we
[1:28:22] might be a wee little bunch you know
[1:28:25] zachus was a we little man I still want
[1:28:27] to be identified with that little we
[1:28:30] right we see the bride she sh sh she has
[1:28:35] thus say the Lord and we have the answer
[1:28:38] to the devil's
[1:28:40] question and that's what the devil is
[1:28:42] howling about because his his tactics
[1:28:47] has been
[1:28:49] exposed and when the devil is exposed
[1:28:51] he's powerless
[1:28:55] talk about exposed those seals
[1:28:57] absolutely did you realize the first
[1:29:00] four seals was just exposing the devil
[1:29:02] in those the form of those first uh four
[1:29:04] horses and the Riders of the first four
[1:29:08] horses sure he just exposing what he had
[1:29:12] done and what he's going to do and so
[1:29:13] forth
[1:29:16] amen we see that's what the devil is
[1:29:19] howling about he said we have the answer
[1:29:22] to the devil's question and he goes on
[1:29:23] to say what is it in that sense it's the
[1:29:26] headship of the word back in the church
[1:29:29] once again
[1:29:30] am the headship of the word see back see
[1:29:34] this headship right see remember uh the
[1:29:39] cloud right see when those seven angels
[1:29:42] ascended it Formed that white wig right
[1:29:45] what was it showing the headship amen
[1:29:49] and in that same message Christ the
[1:29:50] mystery he said oh the headship and the
[1:29:54] body has become one unit right not did
[1:29:57] not will has right right amen that's
[1:30:01] right in other words Christ himself has
[1:30:04] come to take
[1:30:05] control see is it not written the
[1:30:08] government shall be upon her shoulders
[1:30:09] right his shoulders brother B said what
[1:30:12] is his shoulders it's the church on
[1:30:14] Earth God's Earthly strength the
[1:30:16] strongest part of the body on the earth
[1:30:17] is his church his shoulders amen and the
[1:30:21] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:30:23] the church amen God's Earthly strength
[1:30:25] he has no no hands but yours right see
[1:30:28] no hands but mine and feet see oh my
[1:30:32] what is it again in morphia God hiding
[1:30:35] himself in a humble little group of
[1:30:38] people that Malachi for produced do you
[1:30:41] realize that we are the very
[1:30:43] manifestation of Malachi 4 the very
[1:30:46] fruit of the ministry of Malachi for we
[1:30:49] are his
[1:30:51] victory that's right oh oh this is the
[1:30:55] very proof that Malachi 4 didn't fall or
[1:30:57] fail right the word coming to
[1:31:02] maturity oh
[1:31:05] my I wish you all would preached me a
[1:31:07] little
[1:31:09] bit brother Dale said uh brother Wade
[1:31:12] said why don't you just turn loose
[1:31:17] tonight they sure make you feel free
[1:31:20] here and uh I I appreciate that
[1:31:25] but again I don't want to dump the whole

[1:31:32] second oh my is the Lord good to
[1:31:35] us word come to
[1:31:39] maturity God's not willing that You' be
[1:31:41] exalted above measure God's not willing
[1:31:43] see Power without character is
[1:31:45] what power without character that's what
[1:31:48] Lucifer has permitted to be exalted
[1:31:50] above measure and there and there's no
[1:31:52] Redemption for Angels
[1:31:55] no nowhere in the Bible you find any
[1:31:57] Redemption for Angels Fallen Angels No
[1:31:59] Redemption they can't sing Amazing Grace
[1:32:01] they don't do you realize you're made on
[1:32:03] a higher order than Angels what would
[1:32:05] God hear the quickest brother B ask the
[1:32:07] question uh uh Angels or a son of God
[1:32:11] with the word of God you said a son of
[1:32:13] course angels are only ministering
[1:32:16] Spirits sent forth to minister unto us
[1:32:18] who are heirs angels are not Hees come
[1:32:21] on we are the heirs that's right brother
[1:32:25] was singing this
[1:32:28] morning or last night maybe was I'm
[1:32:30] going to take a trip and a good old
[1:32:33] gospel if you're ashamed of me I'm
[1:32:35] still in

[1:37:33] perfect is come that's right amen right
[1:37:36] it's a perfect interpretation of the
[1:37:37] word of God with Divine Vindication
[1:37:40] isn't it wonderful to realize amen oh my
[1:37:43] brother my sister
[1:37:54] thank you
[1:37:56] Jes
[1:37:58] am in
[1:38:02] closing
[1:38:06] Jesus
[1:38:07] see was the Passover Lamb right and
[1:38:12] there they left
[1:38:16] him there the Overcomers the elected
[1:38:19] ones who had the responsibility of
[1:38:21] bringing the word of maturity left the
[1:38:25] word the Passover Lamb himself at the
[1:38:28] Feast of
[1:38:30] Passover where Jerusalem God's only
[1:38:34] provided place of worship in that
[1:38:36] day there they left him and only as they
[1:38:41] return to the word y amen but when we
[1:38:45] come back now every generation has
[1:38:48] opportunity for a fresh and new Revival
[1:38:50] and every fresh and true Rev Bible comes
[1:38:54] when men and women boys and girls have
[1:38:57] gotten back to the word of God their age
[1:39:01] if there's any portion I'm closeing my
[1:39:03] Bible if there's any portion of this
[1:39:05] word that you spurn or that you have
[1:39:08] left or you're not giv preeminence to
[1:39:11] right remember those that threefold
[1:39:13] purpose first to reveal your then to
[1:39:16] gain the preeminence and then to restore
[1:39:17] back one three-fold purpose and this is
[1:39:20] the great mystery yep that's it
[1:39:23] but we must let him have the preeminence
[1:39:25] it's got to be to the place like the
[1:39:27] little boy when he went into the
[1:39:28] blacksmith shop and his daddy had a an
[1:39:31] old cold horseshoe over there and he
[1:39:33] took the tongs and put it in the fire on
[1:39:35] those hot coals and you know that old
[1:39:37] black horseshoe turned white hot just
[1:39:39] like the coal all around it and the
[1:39:41] little boy said
[1:39:42] daddy where is the Horseshoe is the fire
[1:39:45] in the Horseshoe or is the Horseshoe in
[1:39:47] the
[1:39:47] fire and that's the way it's got to be
[1:39:50] with you and I we've got to be so in
[1:39:52] tune with God in such a Harmony and so
[1:39:55] fill of the spirit of God Amen to where
[1:39:58] he has the preeminence did you know one
[1:40:00] place here when brother BR was preaching

[1:40:03] preeminence right because he and the
[1:40:06] church is
[1:40:07] one oh oh my see it's okay for you to
[1:40:12] have the preeminence if you're
[1:40:13] surrendered to him and one man one woman
[1:40:17] one boy one girl one man fully
[1:40:19] surrendered into the hand of God is

[1:58:30] says something about how beautiful upon
[1:58:32] the mountain are the feet of them carry
[1:58:34] the gospel but look at this verse eight
[1:58:37] oh look at this verse eight I got a new
[1:58:39] Bible somebody gave me and I had to get
[1:58:40] it brok in or break into it myself or
[1:58:42] something
[1:58:44] Isaiah Isaiah 52 you know Isaiah is a
[1:58:48] Bible in itself just by
[1:58:50] itself but 52 and8 y you all love this I

[1:58:55] just something stood out uh in this to
[1:58:58] me Isaiah
[1:59:01] 52 and
[1:59:03] eight here it is thy Watchman now he's
[1:59:08] talking about God's Watchman in the
[1:59:09] context not talking about the devil's sh
[1:59:11] Shepherd thy Watchman shall lift up the
[1:59:15] voice
[1:59:17] right with the voice together shall they
[1:59:21] sing right for they shall see eye to eye
[1:59:25] when the Lord shall bring again Zion
[1:59:27] right restoration any time you see the
[1:59:30] daughter Zion brother talk said it's
[1:59:32] talking about the bride right and
[1:59:34] bringing again Zion is the restoration
[1:59:36] of the Bride that's right and I could
[1:59:38] just preach another hour
[1:59:41] now real easy lift up the voice folks
[1:59:44] amen it's one thing to talk message
[1:59:46] something else to walk it and then you
[1:59:48] got to be in Harmony and in the lyrics
[1:59:50] to sing it right but we ought to be in
[1:59:53] such unity and such maturity and such
[1:59:56] Harmony where we can just sing it
[1:59:58] together sing in the voice right not
[2:00:00] just talking it not just walking it
[2:00:02] singing it talking see brother B said
[2:00:05] he's the great composer and we got to
[2:00:07] get in Rhythm get in Rhythm get in the
[2:00:11] harmony get in step is that right oh
[2:00:15] praise the Lord when the music beats low
[2:00:17] he said I'll go down with the music he
[2:00:18] prophesied his own death sure he did
[2:00:21] yeah he said when the music meets out
[2:00:23] the end of brother Ram's life here
[2:00:25] William bram's life I'll go down with
[2:00:27] the music but he said I'm an early riser
[2:00:29] I'm coming forth in the first
[2:00:31] resurrection it'll beat high
[2:00:34] again it'll beat high again if it beats
[2:00:37] out the life of old Gerald Hughes don't
[2:00:39] y'all get excited about that or or or uh
[2:00:42] brother uh Samuel Dale if it beats out
[2:00:46] the life of our precious brother who
[2:00:48] just sung for us here a while ago I'm 83
[2:00:50] years old just go on down with the music
[2:00:54] just let it be don't worry about it
[2:00:57] ain't nothing out of order the composer
[2:00:59] knows what he's doing it's all right
[2:01:01] here in the book it's going to be high
[2:01:03] again the music is going to come to a
[2:01:05] higher note Hallelujah there's an
[2:01:09] occupier I'll come up brother with the
[2:01:11] music how about you you believe that why
[2:01:14] we got the seed planted
[2:01:16] already even death cannot control us
[2:01:22] why would you argue with an enemy that's
[2:01:24] been conquered and captured and and
[2:01:27] prisoned and
[2:01:28] harnessed and be foolish argue with
[2:01:31] something like that but you know death
[2:01:33] belongs to us it's been harnessed
[2:01:38] already brother R said God Christ at
[2:01:41] Calvary took the stinger out of death he
[2:01:43] harnessed him up Hooked him to a
[2:01:45] carriage makes him pull us across Jordan
[2:01:47] into the presence of
[2:01:50] God why would I Fe that it's already
[2:01:52] been
[2:01:53] abolished amen that's old timers that
[2:01:56] makes you throw your shoulders back a
[2:01:58] little bit oh my I see a few gray
[2:02:01] whiskers and and gray heads around here
[2:02:04] they say when you hit 40 you know you
[2:02:06] don't start you don't exactly lose your
[2:02:08] hair it just starts coming out your nose
[2:02:09] and
[2:02:10] ears and it makes you look pretty pretty
[2:02:13] crude and
[2:02:16] unusual but oh we don't have anything to
[2:02:18] worry about we haven't lost to one of
[2:02:20] them have we they're all right there
[2:02:21] waiting for us and God by his own faith
[2:02:24] has already seen you in a glorified body
[2:02:27] if you doubt your own faith that's okay
[2:02:28] but don't doubt God's faith he already
[2:02:30] said
[2:02:31] it he only gives one faith is that right
[2:02:35] oh those he has for
[2:02:38] new predestinated also and then he
[2:02:41] called him then he justified him and he
[2:02:44] hath already
[2:02:45] glorified it's a finished work in the
[2:02:47] mind of god let's just appropriate now
[2:02:50] step into it God rich ly bless you you
