[22:43] we've been reading in Ephesians now
[22:45] we'll read uh second Peter and
[22:47] revelations in a minute as we get on
[22:49] through into the message but we'll just
[22:51] read from uh Ephesians 1 right now so
[22:55] remember the this weekend now remember
[22:58] Saturday night 7 o'clock we will be
[23:00] having services and we'll be doing our
[23:03] fourth of July weekend that we started
[23:05] here 40 years ago and so God has been
[23:10] good to us and like I said if you think
[23:12] we've been 40 years around the mountain
[23:14] maybe we're fixing to leave it I hope so
[23:18] and and you know I believe it maybe
[23:20] we're going to quit this marching around
[23:23] you know and around and two tonight if
[23:25] anybody had a problem we're sorry that
[23:28] the internet system may not be working
[23:30] all right so that they can do the live
[23:32] streaming tonight and but uh you know
[23:35] they'll have it back on the other part
[23:37] of it but it's their problem it's not us
[23:39] it's something wrong with the the wiring
[23:42] systems of the internet system it's not
[23:44] us but maybe it'll work maybe it won't
[23:46] so we don't know they're trying to do
[23:49] everything they can to to get it to
[23:50] going so just remember that and also
[23:54] remember if you will now we want you to
[23:57] PR practice in the church you know your
[24:01] song and things like that but see when
[24:04] you come back you come in and you start
[24:06] practicing and you start fooling with
[24:08] the sound system all right you know it
[24:12] throws it off to where that nobody don't
[24:15] know what's going on because now you got
[24:17] to figure out where what's wrong with
[24:19] the sound system to where that you
[24:21] switch it over to what you think it
[24:22] ought to be you know and and it messes
[24:25] us up so we're just asking you we saying
[24:29] please practice don't misunderstand you
[24:31] get your little feelings hurt then sit
[24:33] down on them forget it but you know just
[24:38] if you're going to practice just ask uh
[24:41] Josh or Tyler say first if we not here
[24:44] ask Richard to come up and make sure
[24:47] that what you're doing with the sound
[24:49] system that goes back to the balance of
[24:51] what it is you know because if you come
[24:54] back there anybody I've come in here
[24:56] myself and even turned on the the sound
[24:59] system when we would start the services
[25:02] and you know and find out that somebody
[25:04] had changed the settings myself you know
[25:07] so I know a little bit about it but not
[25:09] much but I just know which one's got to
[25:11] be Which Way But Richard and Josh and
[25:14] Tyler they know which one to put where
[25:16] and everything to do so if you use it
[25:19] please just just ask one of them to make
[25:22] sure that everything's balanced and put
[25:24] back in order to where that you know cuz
[25:27] if you don't then you start singing a
[25:28] song and it's off right it sounds all
[25:31] right when you're in here with just
[25:33] maybe one and you're doing but then when
[25:36] everything starts back at the rest of
[25:37] the system then it's off and and you'll
[25:40] be up and down and and all kind of
[25:42] things so if you will just please ask
[25:43] and and do that we want you to practice
[25:46] but we want it to be where that we can't
[25:48] won't lose what we're we're doing to set
[25:51] up and have to spend half the time going
[25:53] back through to get it balanced up you
[25:55] know to where it'll be all right so if
[25:57] you would please do that just ask Tyler
[25:59] or ask Josh to help you and if they're
[26:01] not here ask Richard to to come up and
[26:04] and that way everything won't get messed
[26:06] up okay all right so just remember that
[26:09] so as I said Remember the 4th of July
[26:11] this weekend will be coming up I'm
[26:13] looking forward to it brother Keith Reed
[26:15] going to be with us to preach for us on
[26:18] on Saturday night and then Sunday
[26:20] morning and then we will be having a
[26:23] dinner together and it is Catered for
[26:25] you because we appreciate you because
[26:28] the 40 years has been with you uh and
[26:30] all and we we certainly appreciate it
[26:34] and we want you to be happy about it so
[26:36] that's we've decided to do it that way
[26:38] and you know ask the Lord to bless and
[26:40] just keep each one of us all right so
[26:42] let's go to our scripture
[26:45] Ephesians 1 and if there's anything else
[26:48] uh yes two we will be eating together
[26:51] but there will be no evening service CU
[26:53] we'll be eating together and just
[26:55] fellowshipping together and we'll have
[26:57] plent plenty of time and there won't be
[26:59] any communion foot washing or something
[27:02] we'll switch it on over maybe to the
[27:04] next weekend or whatever because we are
[27:07] moving the Bible study from the first
[27:09] Saturday to the second Saturday of this
[27:12] month of this coming month of July to
[27:14] where that we can get everything
[27:16] balanced up okay all right father we
[27:18] thank you and we love you and we ask you
[27:20] to just help each and every one of us
[27:22] and Lord just direct us all into what to
[27:24] say and Lord what we would try to say
[27:27] our own selves you control that to where
[27:30] that we would only bring what you want
[27:31] to be brought unto your people because
[27:34] we we we just depend upon you we ask you
[27:36] to help us and to guide us and give us
[27:39] understanding because you know that's
[27:41] our prayer constantly is Lord give us
[27:44] understanding of Thy word not just
[27:46] intellectual concept but understanding
[27:49] by revelation we love you and we thank
[27:52] you and we commit it all to you now in
[27:54] Jesus name amen
[28:00] Ephesians 1 verse three blessed be the
[28:04] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:06] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[28:09] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[28:11] according as he has chosen Us in him
[28:13] before the foundation of the world that
[28:15] we should be holy Without Blame before
[28:17] him in love having predestinated us unto
[28:20] it the adoption of children by Jesus
[28:23] Christ to himself according to the good
[28:26] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[28:28] the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[28:30] made us accepted in the Beloved amen you
[28:34] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing I
[28:37] hope you brought back your quotes from
[28:39] Sunday and everything cuz I didn't run
[28:42] any off and everything to get it uh you
[28:45] know for tonight because I knew we just
[28:48] continue the same
[28:50] point cuz I'm wanting you to see
[28:53] something that you know I believe the
[28:56] Bible proves
[28:58] you know the prophet didn't come to give
[29:00] us another book or anything like that he
[29:02] come to give us the understanding of the
[29:06] Bible that we already had we were the
[29:09] one that had ones that had it
[29:11] confused it it it it wasn't confused it
[29:14] didn't change you know that was what was
[29:17] so amazing that one day that I found out
[29:19] my Bible didn't say for me to baptize
[29:21] Father Son and Holy Ghost right you know
[29:23] I thought it did I mean I read it and we
[29:26] done it you know cuz we thought that's
[29:28] what it was but we come to find out that
[29:30] wasn't what it said right well then the
[29:32] prophet didn't come to to give us a new
[29:35] Bible he studied other translations and
[29:38] things and used them and that's fine you
[29:41] know to and I do too I use it to compare
[29:44] and and and to see what's you know the
[29:47] uh points and all of the of what the the
[29:50] maybe the commentators would say about
[29:52] it or or the different Bibles I I like
[29:55] to do that that's fine but I do it for
[29:58] the point of of understanding to help me
[30:02] to understand and see the truth right
[30:06] but now we've been talking
[30:09] about you know adoption and we've been
[30:12] talking about and got up to the stage of
[30:15] speaking now about uh Romans 8 and 23
[30:19] where it says to
[30:21] Wi the Redemption of our body all right
[30:25] that is the adoption that we need right
[30:28] now
[30:30] uh I I've tried to make it plain as I
[30:33] could as much as I know but that's why I
[30:36] try to teach the adoption in three
[30:38] stages cuz the prophet said you bring
[30:40] everything in threes and things amen and
[30:43] and that way you can understand it
[30:45] better but I tried to bring the adoption
[30:48] to that point to where that you know
[30:50] when you're born again we were we were
[30:53] just totally annihilated from the
[30:55] promises of God we were we're not not in
[30:57] no form to be able to claim inheritance
[31:01] of any form right and you know Gentiles
[31:03] and and it would have mattered if you
[31:05] were a literal Jew uh you still can't
[31:08] claim anything on that basis but see
[31:12] then we had to be adopted into the
[31:14] family of God by the new birth amen now
[31:18] that's what I believe that that would
[31:20] take place because what Paul said in
[31:22] Romans 8 about 15 that we receive the
[31:25] spirit of adoption right amen that's why
[31:27] he called it like that and brother
[31:28] random I know what he would bring it to
[31:31] and and talk about the adoption as being
[31:34] the uh the checkbook and the hear you
[31:38] himym and the the things of that order
[31:40] of the re of the Matthew 17 I know that
[31:45] I know he also taught that we've got to
[31:47] be born again you know and and by doing
[31:51] that God had to bring us into his family
[31:54] right by the new birth right all right
[31:57] well why can't we just say that he
[31:58] adopted us into the family because
[32:00] that's what he did and giving us all
[32:02] rights and reserving everything and then
[32:05] we studied for quite a while about the
[32:07] uh the fact of talking about the uh the
[32:12] you know Matthew 17 to where it would
[32:15] come down to the checkbook and your name
[32:18] just as good on the checkbook you know
[32:20] as your father Etc but then we started
[32:23] the past few Services talking about the
[32:26] where Paul get down and he he doesn't
[32:28] say that this is the Redemption of the
[32:31] body see that's where our our troubles
[32:34] has been we've tried to implant into
[32:38] things that's not there it's talking
[32:40] about to wit and the word to wit is to
[32:45] understand or to be witty smart you know
[32:47] intelligent but see when you even put it
[32:50] to the intelligence form and you go back
[32:53] to Webster it draws it right back down
[32:55] to to the word to wit or wit meaning
[33:00] that you know a witty person is a person
[33:02] who has knowledge right amen I mean
[33:04] that's the sensible understanding that
[33:07] it has knowledge and see Paul then is
[33:09] not talking about the literal
[33:12] change he's talking about a group of
[33:14] people that when the head and body
[33:17] unites in the body of Christ and that's
[33:19] the way I tried to bring it that when it
[33:22] comes to the second stage of the amount
[33:24] of transfiguration that Jesus said and
[33:27] you know came to yeah then he went forth
[33:29] and bringing the message of eternal life
[33:33] right through the opening of the seals
[33:34] and everything and that was the way we
[33:36] compared it exactly with the way brother
[33:38] brandom went right right through you
[33:41] know with him and his coming and his
[33:43] restoring the faith of the fathers and
[33:45] then 30 something years to do that then
[33:48] his message comes and and we' give you
[33:50] all of these quotes to give you better
[33:53] understanding to let you see what he
[33:55] said right uh but we see then it's
[33:57] coming down to understand the Redemption
[33:59] of the body that's right cuz we can't
[34:01] get the the the body changed until we
[34:04] understand how it's to be change
[34:06] right that that shouldn't be a problem
[34:08] with anyone everybody said brother
[34:10] Dale's an intellect I think I'm a dummy
[34:12] but it's all right I prove it most of
[34:14] the time but
[34:17] see it it's coming to a place of
[34:21] understanding that's right amen now
[34:23] that's what we need you say oh we need
[34:25] to change of the body we we need to
[34:27] understand what
[34:29] transpires not the uh chemical uh part
[34:34] that it starts here and it works here
[34:35] and goes there and this turns and that
[34:37] turns and we start with A Little Bit Of
[34:39] in in eternity in the middle of the
[34:41] Bailey and we work our way out I'm not
[34:42] talking about
[34:44] junk I'm talking about that we need to
[34:47] understand the Plan of Redemption right
[34:50] well I understand the plan justification
[34:52] sa baptism all ghost well why is a lot
[34:55] of the people still looking for yeah a
[34:58] new body to come body that's right amen
[35:00] and they're doing it in this message
[35:01] they still believe that they're going to
[35:02] get a new body that's right you see and
[35:06] and and all like that and this this
[35:08] world is going to be
[35:10] destroyed yeah well the Bible says it
[35:14] yeah and the prophet said that we didn't
[35:15] understand what the Bible
[35:18] said so we used those the other day now
[35:20] let's just turn there in Peter and use
[35:24] these These are the scriptures that
[35:25] brother randam used and the main point
[35:27] I'm want you to get tonight is one
[35:31] thing I believe in a Redemption of the
[35:34] body right all right yeah I believe this
[35:37] body will be redeemed right amen all
[35:40] right I believe this world that we're
[35:42] standing on will one day be redeemed and
[35:46] then the future home and that's why I've
[35:48] asked you to read that message over and
[35:51] over there is where the city can come
[35:53] down upon this earth right all right
[35:57] now see then in the Plan of Redemption
[36:00] we'll see it very plainly that
[36:03] justification sanctification the baptism
[36:06] of the Holy Ghost didn't annihilate you
[36:08] no that's right it only cleansed you and
[36:11] set you aside and then God come and
[36:14] filled you burn out the things now you
[36:17] all we're in the message see so then why
[36:20] can't we see that the same Plan of
[36:23] Redemption is for the world right all
[36:28] right and if you've read the future home
[36:30] you don't around what he said he said
[36:33] the world was justified in the days of
[36:34] Noah Sanctified and Jesus dropping his
[36:37] blood and one day we'll receive a fiery
[36:40] baptism to cleanse it and claim it you
[36:42] know cleanse it and set it aside to
[36:45] where we can come back and live here
[36:46] that's right all right now in doing that
[36:49] then see why can't we see that these
[36:53] bodies right see these bodies come out
[36:57] of this
[36:58] Earth all
[37:01] right and see then coming out of the
[37:05] earth then the body to be redeemed will
[37:09] have to go through the same thing right
[37:12] as the soul has went through to redeem
[37:15] it and as the world will eventually go
[37:19] through and the only thing that what we
[37:21] do is and that's that's part of the
[37:23] mystery you see we embodying things we
[37:27] step ahead of the world that's right
[37:29] amen see we go ahead of the world right
[37:33] all right now we may not get that far
[37:36] tonight but we we Step Ahead see the
[37:39] world was justified in the days of Noah
[37:42] Sanctified with Jesus's blood was having
[37:44] to wait for a fiery
[37:46] baptism but we step ahead of the world
[37:49] right and we're going to go into a
[37:51] change and go out of here in a moment of
[37:53] Twinkle an eye and all of that before
[37:56] the world
[37:57] will get its fiery baptism amen all
[37:59] right but see that's the secret that's
[38:02] laying in between to where we can
[38:04] understand but the main thing I want you
[38:06] to understand and people on the internet
[38:09] systems to understand that see we used
[38:13] to believe the world would be destroyed
[38:15] y you know I mean that that's what we
[38:18] all
[38:19] Tau I don't know what we thought but I
[38:22] know what we thought I guess we thought
[38:25] it was just going to and and then God
[38:28] would have to create and start back over
[38:30] again and and you know and all of the
[38:33] things and but we come to find out that
[38:36] wasn't exactly the way God had said it
[38:38] that's right amen all right now that's
[38:40] where we want to read in
[38:43] Peter to see that according to
[38:49] Peter that in the
[38:51] flood the
[38:54] world was destroyed
[39:00] that was his word
[39:02] amen but we're still
[39:05] here right right see so we missed
[39:08] it standing on the thing and said y back
[39:12] there know the world was destroyed well
[39:15] what did we do did we all get up and not
[39:18] ride over an ark and and come over and
[39:20] come down did that Ark carry us on up to
[39:22] another planet set us down on it or some
[39:25] kind of something I don't know right
[39:28] these all kind of man's ideas but just
[39:31] get to point now so let's read what
[39:33] Peter has to say about it to make
[39:37] sure look at verse 5 of Peter second
[39:41] Peter 3 and 5 for this they willingly
[39:44] are ignorant of that by the word of God
[39:47] the heavens were of old and the Earth
[39:49] standing out of the water and in the
[39:52] water
[39:53] now but the heavens and earth which
[39:56] which are now excuse me first see we by
[39:59] the world that then was being overflowed
[40:03] with water
[40:07] perished it didn't
[40:09] destroy right it only destroyed the
[40:12] sin
[40:14] right now you think about
[40:18] it you you that have studied anything
[40:21] and know anything that like up here in
[40:24] in Kentucky they find fossils
[40:28] of
[40:33] alligators they dig down in the
[40:37] ground and all of them great big animals
[40:40] and all kind of things wo over the top
[40:44] of them and you know what you got the
[40:45] church riding on them yely
[40:49] right cuz you got the oil right it took
[40:53] all the pressures and all of the things
[40:55] that made cold it made you know all kind
[40:58] of things and see it was made out of
[41:01] those bodies of people that's right and
[41:04] animals that's right that was destroyed
[41:06] in the flood amen right but all it was
[41:09] destroyed was the sin of the world right
[41:13] the core the outside was just moved
[41:16] about and and great changes took place
[41:19] and and and all kind of things around
[41:21] the world took place at the what we call
[41:25] the destroying of the world right amen
[41:28] but it wasn't destroyed right it only
[41:31] destroyed the world which is the cosmos
[41:34] right World Order
[41:36] systems all
[41:38] right then as I said you can go to
[41:41] different places you know and they're
[41:42] finding all over they find uh they found
[41:45] whole
[41:46] elephants you know just totally in
[41:50] inbedded in
[41:51] ice that had to happen so quickly until
[41:55] they had the green grass GR in their
[41:59] mouth and their digestive systems and
[42:02] everything was was full of green stuff
[42:05] and all it happened so fast that's
[42:08] what's called a destroying of the world
[42:10] right but it didn't annihilate the world
[42:12] Amen so that's why your prophecy when he
[42:15] picks these up as we'll read him he said
[42:18] that was something for me to see that
[42:21] that's right so Peter says it you know
[42:24] all right
[42:26] where by the world that then was being
[42:29] overflowed with water
[42:31] perished but the heavens and the Earth
[42:34] which are now by the same word are kept
[42:38] in
[42:41] store he just moved everything about
[42:48] right reserved unto fire against the day
[42:50] of judgment and predition of ungodly men
[42:53] all right drop down to verse 10 but the
[42:55] day of the Lord shall shall come as a
[42:56] thief of the night in which the heaven
[42:59] shall pass away with a great noise and
[43:02] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[43:04] the Earth also and the works that
[43:06] therein shall be burned up right looks
[43:10] like one of these days is going to be
[43:12] another Annihilation yeah and we'll get
[43:15] to it in a minute and read where the
[43:16] Prophet said see there it's not that
[43:18] it's the
[43:20] cosmos the world order that's destroyed
[43:23] all right then we go over to revelation
[43:26] 21 that we were using the other
[43:31] day 21 and verse one and I saw a new
[43:34] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[43:36] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[43:38] away brother R says same word
[43:42] see and there was no more CA and now
[43:44] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[43:47] coming down from God out of Heaven
[43:49] prepared as a bride Adorn for her
[43:53] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[43:55] the heaven said saying behold the
[43:56] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[43:59] will dwell with them and they shall be
[44:00] his people and what does it keep on
[44:02] going and it looks like one of these
[44:05] days is going to be a great
[44:08] Annihilation and it will
[44:11] be there will be but it'll only burn off
[44:15] sin Cosmos World
[44:18] water all right now what I'm trying to
[44:22] get us to make sure we understand there
[44:24] if we can see that's
[44:27] possible that this world can be
[44:30] redeemed now this is what I was trying
[44:32] to get across Sunday afternoon but I
[44:34] just said well I better hold it and back
[44:36] up a little bit and if we can just
[44:40] see that this world can one day be
[44:45] redeemed that's right you know that's
[44:49] right and that the new city can come
[44:51] down and John saw it he evident was on
[44:53] Earth and looking up he saw it he's
[44:55] standing on something and he saw it come
[44:56] down somewhere so why not you know all
[45:00] right but if we can see that now here's
[45:02] the point of the
[45:04] message if we can see that this
[45:07] world can one day be
[45:10] redeemed
[45:12] right why would we have any trouble
[45:15] about our bodies being redeemed that's
[45:17] right
[45:19] am why everybody want to you
[45:23] it
[45:24] right I know what it was in organized
[45:27] religion we didn't believe God was
[45:29] capable you said no no no no yeah yeah
[45:32] yeah yeah we didn't believe God was
[45:35] capable of doing things we wanted
[45:37] doctors to take care of our bodies we
[45:39] didn't need healing we needed
[45:41] doctors I reckon we thought God was
[45:43] supposed to give us doctors and thank
[45:45] God he gave us
[45:46] doctors
[45:48] sure but the point that see we look at
[45:51] it and we've always mankind has always
[45:54] taught
[45:56] it is going to get a new body yeah
[45:59] that's right why can't we believe if we
[46:02] believe the soul can be
[46:05] saved and we believe that the world can
[46:09] be
[46:11] redeemed why can't we believe our bodies
[46:13] can be that's right amen now they're not
[46:16] going to be 70 years old no no right see
[46:21] we've heard we understand the message of
[46:24] redemption amen we're going to go back
[46:27] to a young man a young woman you know
[46:30] everybody's going to be 18 20 years old
[46:32] or
[46:34] something because that's going to be the
[46:36] setup that's right the babies is going
[46:38] to come up in age the older ones like us
[46:40] is going backward amen see and some of
[46:44] you the 1820 were going to meet you in
[46:45] the middle but that still won't be you
[46:47] cuz you got to still be changed right
[46:50] that's right all right but that's the
[46:52] main point see and when when we read
[46:56] what the prophet has said then we can
[46:58] see that the Bible is not saying what we
[47:01] thought it said
[47:03] right we thought it said it would pass
[47:07] away and John sees the city coming down
[47:10] out of Heaven to land somewhere amen
[47:14] amen why not just believe it's right
[47:16] here right we stand on you got a
[47:19] millennial reain you got a cleansing of
[47:21] this Earth in the millennial Reign amen
[47:24] you know before the Millennium comes
[47:26] you got a a a a transforming until it be
[47:29] back to a Garden of Eden that's right
[47:32] amen and then we going to blow it
[47:35] away see that's why but the people of
[47:37] the message see they don't believe that
[47:39] because they don't believe in the
[47:40] Redemption of the Soul they believe your
[47:42] soul is
[47:44] annihilated no it's the nature of your
[47:47] soul right
[47:50] right the nature of your soul the
[47:52] prophet said was of the world right
[47:56] amen and it had to be redeemed right
[47:59] amen all right but once it's redeemed
[48:02] see Satan can't get his hands back on it
[48:04] right amen that's why I want you to read
[48:07] the future home and just go backwards
[48:08] and for and look and and and think with
[48:11] him when he's talking there's many
[48:12] statements that he's making in there
[48:15] that will sound just exactly like that
[48:17] he's he's talking about Redemption of
[48:20] the soul and he'll be talking about the
[48:22] body he'll be talking about the
[48:24] world
[48:26] read it very
[48:28] carefully dissect the message as we call
[48:31] it right take it very carefully there is
[48:34] a statement let's see in the church age
[48:36] book where when they put it in the
[48:39] church age book they they were talking
[48:40] and and and one little paragraph brother
[48:43] brandham is covering River Jordan and
[48:45] he's covering Mount of transfiguration
[48:47] and they put it all in one
[48:52] thing and see it's two entirely
[48:54] different events right but the way it's
[48:57] connected in the paragraph little short
[49:00] one it looks like brother R don't even
[49:02] know what in the world he's talking
[49:06] about but see that's why the Holy
[49:09] Ghost is supposed to set these things in
[49:11] order you remember the the board you
[49:13] know you know brother R saying our
[49:15] language is messed up you know about
[49:17] board but remember the before and after
[49:19] describes it you know come on board and
[49:22] pay your board cuz I'm bored with you
[49:24] well that's just explain what I'm saying
[49:27] you know what I'm saying about the word
[49:28] board then so it's the Bible clearing
[49:31] and understanding amen and the prophet
[49:34] didn't have to change
[49:36] it but see everybody with the big
[49:39] education you know yeah oh it's going to
[49:41] be blow away when he days I got them
[49:43] words and brother R come along and he
[49:44] said well here's this word and said U
[49:47] now this big old word here he said I
[49:49] have to spell it to you cuz I can't even
[49:51] pronounce it but said it don't mean
[49:53] destroyed y said it just means to pass
[49:56] from one form to another one and here's
[49:59] a big old stuff shirt you think he on
[50:01] stuffed his shirt no come on he walked
[50:05] out of there and said he don't know what
[50:07] he's talking about
[50:10] y like aons and
[50:13] eons you and all kind of things I tried
[50:16] to talk to my brother-in-law one time
[50:17] about that the hell wasn't Eternal and
[50:19] he could quote them big old words cuz
[50:20] he'd been to
[50:22] college but what was the problem with
[50:24] him he just didn't understand how own ID
[50:26] idiot like me with a ninth grade
[50:27] education could know what them words
[50:29] meant and could tell him
[50:31] y all right but you see it takes the
[50:34] holy
[50:35] spirit all right that's right it takes
[50:37] the prophet's message so now let's just
[50:39] read a little bit and let brother around
[50:41] and then if I have time I have some more
[50:43] on the back here I'll try to get to but
[50:44] if we don't I just want you to
[50:46] understand one
[50:48] thing and the anybody listening of what
[50:50] we
[50:51] believe we believe in the Redemption of
[50:54] the body amen
[50:56] we believe in the Redemption of the Soul
[50:58] we believe in the Redemption of the body
[51:00] we believe in the Redemption of the
[51:01] world and that none of it means
[51:04] Annihilation it means Annihilation to
[51:06] the natures of it or the cosmos World
[51:10] Order of it right or the the top of it
[51:13] or the the
[51:15] trash and I believe it's far that's why
[51:17] it says heavens and earth because as far
[51:19] as man has went out in
[51:22] space to the moon and whatever these
[51:25] ships are going on now Way Beyond there
[51:27] and going on out into the atmosphere
[51:30] that's got to be
[51:31] cleansed y right see because why because
[51:36] mankind that put his ear mark on
[51:38] it right right see all right let's let's
[51:43] just read some and think about it if you
[51:45] have them if you don't then just go get
[51:47] the book and read it that's what I said
[51:48] I I almost R run the whole
[51:52] book but let's just start off
[51:56] this is page 14 of future home pre
[51:59] 64802 now now notice how G makes plain
[52:03] to us his Plan of
[52:05] Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul
[52:08] when I saw it how he makes plain when he
[52:11] didn't understand it always he he come
[52:13] to an understanding one day how he makes
[52:17] plain to us here now his Plan of
[52:20] Redemption now compare what we see with
[52:23] our own eyes what God has done to redeem
[52:27] his world he done the same plan to
[52:30] redeem his people for the unchangeable
[52:32] god changes not any of his plans of
[52:35] anything such a glorious thing
[52:38] continuous reading how he led us to
[52:41] himself a Tabernacle in Us by three
[52:43] stages of Grace just like he's led the
[52:46] world in three stages to come through
[52:48] the world as God will come to the world
[52:51] after it's gone through three different
[52:53] stages of purification
[52:55] that's exactly how he comes to us
[52:58] through three stages of Grace I've
[53:00] taught that at the beginning I never
[53:02] changed since of course now they're
[53:04] saying that brother brand says they're
[53:06] quoting brother brandham and saying that
[53:07] brother brand said it's just the Holy
[53:08] Ghost now no I believe it's
[53:11] justification sanctification the baptism
[53:13] of the Holy Ghost and he said here I
[53:14] know it's two times in this message he
[53:16] said I taught that from the
[53:19] beginning cuz he always taught it kept
[53:21] his trees running collect right page 13
[53:26] future home he said it's only the
[53:28] atmosphere around it and the sin that's
[53:31] upon the Earth that will be
[53:33] destroyed now we realize that the
[53:35] heavens means the atmosphere above he's
[53:38] talking about the thistles and the thing
[53:40] it's only that to be
[53:43] destroyed
[53:44] y sin will be destroyed all
[53:49] right going down page 13 still in the
[53:51] future home and this existing Heavens
[53:54] are atmospheres and the Earth which is
[53:57] now this Earth holds those things but it
[54:00] wasn't made for that purpose sin caused
[54:03] it to be like that see it was made by
[54:06] God the Creator but all now what's where
[54:08] he put and all of our bodies that we
[54:11] live in now we're put in the earth when
[54:13] God created it because you're out of the
[54:16] Dust of the
[54:17] earth it was all laid out here when God
[54:20] himself created it you were in his
[54:23] thinking and in him the Great Eternal
[54:25] was the thought which is the attribute
[54:28] all right now it's like I told you a
[54:31] little catch
[54:33] there if you'll notice in your
[54:36] Bible that it said when Jesus went down
[54:40] he preached to the spirit that were
[54:42] Spirits in prison and it
[54:45] stipulates to those who were disobedient
[54:48] in the longsuffering in the days of Noah
[54:50] right
[54:52] yeah now why would he STI ulate it why
[54:55] would God stipulate it like
[54:59] that see it was 2,000 years right from
[55:02] the creation to the flood
[55:05] right but brother Brown said that your
[55:07] body was
[55:12] justified when the rain fell on it in
[55:14] the days of Noah what about those people
[55:17] before
[55:20] then give you something to think
[55:23] I so Jesus had to go preach to those who
[55:27] were in The Longs suffering in the days
[55:30] of
[55:32] Noah
[55:34] see he had to bring a
[55:38] witness a witness to them that there
[55:41] were some people that were going to be
[55:44] redeemed right right that's right was
[55:46] that not his witness exactly right other
[55:48] words didn't he go down and tell them
[55:50] you missed it y but there's people that
[55:53] have took this message and lived
[55:55] they people that took Noah's message and
[55:57] lived right amen that was 2,000 years
[56:01] remember a world a scientific
[56:05] world but see just just drop a little
[56:07] point to you
[56:10] right so then we know that Peter says
[56:13] according to page 14 future
[56:15] home here the Apostle
[56:18] in second Peter here the second chapter
[56:21] the fifth ver it's really
[56:23] the what's the third
[56:26] chapter yes I've got it it refers to
[56:28] three stages of the earth see he he gets
[56:31] three stages of it notice how he brings
[56:34] them the old world stood out of the
[56:37] water now that was the Andel luian now
[56:41] the one that is the present world we
[56:43] live in now called it a world the old
[56:46] world that stood out of water Genesis 1
[56:48] now the world that is now present and
[56:51] then again he refers to another one the
[56:54] the world that is to come the new world
[56:57] three stages of the world so then now
[57:01] the three stages is going to stay the
[57:03] same as for your soul justification
[57:07] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[57:09] Ghost
[57:12] right it's going to stay that way notice
[57:15] how God makes plain to us his Plan of
[57:19] Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul
[57:22] when I saw it how he may explain to us
[57:24] here now his Plan of Redemption now
[57:27] compare that with our own eyes that God
[57:29] has done to redeem the world he's done
[57:31] the same plan to redeem his people for
[57:33] the unchangeable God now I quoted that
[57:35] one more ago and I want you to get it
[57:37] how he led us to himself a Tabernacle in
[57:40] three stages of Grace just like he led
[57:41] the world in three stages to come
[57:43] through the world as God will come to
[57:45] the world after it's gone through three
[57:47] different stages of purification that's
[57:49] exactly how he comes to us through three
[57:52] stages of Grace I've talked that at the
[57:54] beginning I've never changed he said
[57:56] keep your threes straight all
[58:00] right page 14 still in the future
[58:04] home the old world the Andel livan the
[58:07] world that's present now the one to come
[58:09] the W ages that he begin that he brings
[58:11] to us see his Plan of Redemption is
[58:13] exactly the same by everything he uses
[58:16] the same method he never
[58:19] changes just getting you to see
[58:22] something if we can get to hopes of
[58:24] seeing at the world and how it can be
[58:27] and remember what I was
[58:28] saying remember my
[58:31] point to
[58:33] Wi to
[58:36] understand the Redemption of these
[58:40] bodies so we can understand the
[58:42] Redemption of the Soul then we can go
[58:44] over and understand the Redemption of
[58:45] the
[58:46] world it'll be a simple matter to come
[58:48] back and understand the Redemption of
[58:50] the body that's right maybe a little
[58:53] uh
[58:55] there that we have to get but it's still
[58:58] there because you're going to say to me
[59:00] brother Dale how can your body go
[59:03] through justification sanctification the
[59:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's very
[59:06] easy but I won't say it but that's very
[59:09] easy we just hold that if we get to it
[59:11] tonight we'll get on to that point if
[59:12] not we'll cover it
[59:14] later going down page 15 future home God
[59:18] makes it plain to us if that wasn't a
[59:21] great confirmation a good a great loving
[59:24] blessing
[59:25] from God when I see this and see that
[59:27] since a boy first time ever Christ dealt
[59:30] with me I've always taught those three
[59:32] stages of Grace notice if it isn't true
[59:37] now it goes on down page 17 how striking
[59:40] he takes a place where we are to dwell
[59:42] through the same process now he's called
[59:44] The Church through justification he
[59:45] called it through sanctification then
[59:47] filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[59:49] and took it through a process that he
[59:51] himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son
[59:53] of God could could dwell in the human
[59:56] heart now it has to go through that
[59:58] before it can come into it notice he
[1:00:00] done the world where the bride's going
[1:00:03] to live in the same way his plan of of
[1:00:07] Salvation notice the and deluvian world
[1:00:09] after it had repented by through the
[1:00:11] Bride of that day now watch it look how
[1:00:14] he would tie the the the world to
[1:00:17] cleanse it it's a message you remember
[1:00:19] that prior to this
[1:00:21] message it's a message brother had a
[1:00:26] message there's got to be a message to
[1:00:28] go with it all right brother dick and I
[1:00:31] were talking down while ago see that's
[1:00:33] what people don't
[1:00:34] understand it's two accounts in the book
[1:00:37] of of what is in Luke I guess but anyhow
[1:00:40] it's two account in the gospel maybe one
[1:00:42] in the book of Acts that when Jesus
[1:00:44] appeared to the disciples when he
[1:00:46] appeared to two on the road to M he
[1:00:47] opened their understanding of the
[1:00:49] scriptures that didn't give them the new
[1:00:50] word right amen they to go to Pentecost
[1:00:54] open the understanding to the disciples
[1:00:56] after he met them right that didn't give
[1:00:59] them the new birth they had to go to
[1:01:00] Pentecost to get the new birth but he
[1:01:02] opened their understanding see brother
[1:01:04] random has come and preached a message
[1:01:06] to you and I that we ought to be able to
[1:01:08] understand the Redemption of the body in
[1:01:10] the world and the Soul at least our
[1:01:13] understanding ought to be opened right
[1:01:16] that us whole lot further beyond the the
[1:01:19] understanding that we previously had
[1:01:22] right but I want to re
[1:01:26] am I want that to become personal to me
[1:01:29] amen amen like I was tell in W the other
[1:01:32] day but I mentioned it brother dick you
[1:01:34] know I've told a lot of things around
[1:01:36] here that God's done and I've seen and
[1:01:38] things like that well you know if you
[1:01:39] want to take me to a lighter detector's
[1:01:40] test I'll go with
[1:01:42] you cuz there's no way in the world
[1:01:44] you're going to get that to deny what I
[1:01:46] saw Brother Gary is talking about
[1:01:50] it man sees a pink elephant take him to
[1:01:53] a lie detector test and the L test would
[1:01:55] show he seen a peak elephant
[1:01:58] right you said no it don't exist it did
[1:02:01] to him yeah
[1:02:04] amen the machine will show that what's
[1:02:07] right if you got something within your
[1:02:10] heart there's no way for Satan to take
[1:02:12] that out of
[1:02:14] you you have the new birth there's not
[1:02:16] enough demons in this whole world to get
[1:02:19] you to deny that Holy Ghost that's
[1:02:20] inside of your soul cuz if it deny you
[1:02:23] deny you don't have
[1:02:25] it there wasn't one born again
[1:02:29] Christian that denied Jesus Christ in
[1:02:31] the FX of book of Martyrs now there was
[1:02:33] a lot that didn't have it
[1:02:37] right that turned and walked
[1:02:40] away a lot of difference in where
[1:02:42] something's personal or
[1:02:45] not after 40 years we already have an
[1:02:48] understanding of brother Brandon's
[1:02:50] message
[1:02:52] right God has opened our understanding
[1:02:55] but now we need a
[1:02:59] revelation there's a lot of difference
[1:03:00] between a head knowledge and a
[1:03:02] revelation you can't walk on the head
[1:03:04] knowledge pink elephants you can't stand
[1:03:06] on them right cuz they don't
[1:03:11] exist but if it was a revelation you
[1:03:13] could walk on
[1:03:15] it that's why you can't take away what
[1:03:18] somebody has seen right brother BR said
[1:03:21] if God told me to go raise George
[1:03:23] Washington from the dead he said I'd
[1:03:25] invite the world that's right to come
[1:03:27] and see him raised amen why cuz he had
[1:03:30] something real right yeah see he was
[1:03:34] dwelling in a
[1:03:36] reality all right so why can't we
[1:03:39] understand
[1:03:44] it all right let's see you page 17
[1:03:49] future home notice the Andel livan world
[1:03:52] after it had repented through the Bride
[1:03:53] of that day day Noah he gave it a water
[1:03:56] baptism covered it over with water then
[1:03:59] justification showing that he's on the
[1:04:01] road to called his Fallen World from
[1:04:04] Eden back to its restoration again then
[1:04:08] Christ came and shed his blood upon it
[1:04:10] cleanse it and claiming it see that's
[1:04:14] the world that we live in
[1:04:17] now that's why Satan he goes on down he
[1:04:20] said that's why Satan tried to give
[1:04:22] Jesus the world he showed him everything
[1:04:26] and said I'll give it to you if you just
[1:04:27] fall down and worship
[1:04:30] me see but brother R said what he had an
[1:04:33] ear marked if he done that that's why he
[1:04:35] couldn't do it going down not did you
[1:04:38] notice Abraham when they tried to give
[1:04:40] him the land he bought it with so many
[1:04:42] sickles of silver before the people as a
[1:04:44] an inside said he drop down he tried to
[1:04:47] give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't
[1:04:50] receive it see then Satan could still
[1:04:53] have claim on this
[1:04:54] but it had to be
[1:04:57] bought San would have a claim on this
[1:05:00] world y if Jesus hadn't paid the price
[1:05:04] amen but when he paid the price Satan
[1:05:06] has nothing to do with it scripture say
[1:05:09] what Jesus there one day said Satan's
[1:05:11] coming and have nothing in me right now
[1:05:14] I want to get to that place amen now I
[1:05:17] may be there and so by the new birth
[1:05:20] yeah but I want that to be said about
[1:05:22] the rest of me right you said well I
[1:05:24] don't think you'll ever get that way
[1:05:26] well that's all right I now striving for
[1:05:29] that's right am you remember why I said
[1:05:31] that they quit on all of this stuff you
[1:05:32] know they're not going nowhere anymore
[1:05:34] why cuz it donees reach interplanetary
[1:05:35] travel and the prophet said that's the
[1:05:37] type of the Rapture so there's not a
[1:05:39] push to go right oh yeah they want to
[1:05:42] travel around but they drop back down
[1:05:44] right they
[1:05:53] watch let's just go on over and read a
[1:05:55] few for the world Listen to The Prophet
[1:05:58] page 23 future home for the world is
[1:06:01] number 13 if you're looking on your
[1:06:02] notes with
[1:06:03] me for the world is one of his
[1:06:06] attributes
[1:06:08] right now why is he so overjoy about
[1:06:10] redeeming this
[1:06:12] thing why wouldn't it be an easy matter
[1:06:15] to blow it apart and build and speak
[1:06:16] another
[1:06:18] one he's not going to do it but look
[1:06:21] what he
[1:06:22] says you realize that if he blowed this
[1:06:24] world
[1:06:25] apart he blow your body out of existence
[1:06:28] and you would have to get a new
[1:06:30] it right where'd you get it from Venus
[1:06:34] Mars Pluto or
[1:06:36] who still all the same Earth I thought
[1:06:40] we believed at least in some form the
[1:06:41] prophet did about the The Big Bang
[1:06:44] Theory he said everything come from the
[1:06:46] you know the S said everything come from
[1:06:48] the the one ball of gas that just blew
[1:06:50] apart back in the beginning yes so all
[1:06:53] of these PL and everything out there and
[1:06:55] they're still even moving we're moving
[1:06:57] we're not sitting here we're
[1:06:59] moving science can prove all of these
[1:07:01] things to
[1:07:03] us but
[1:07:05] look for the world is one of his
[1:07:07] attributes just the same as you are one
[1:07:09] of his attributes the world becomes one
[1:07:11] of his attributes because it was God's
[1:07:13] thinking in the beginning to have a
[1:07:15] world to be on a throne to be a king to
[1:07:18] be a redeemer to be a Healer that's his
[1:07:20] attributes we like the Healer like the
[1:07:21] Redeemer what about he's going to sit on
[1:07:22] the throne work here
[1:07:26] in this
[1:07:28] world we're going to sit on the throne
[1:07:30] with him too work here in this world
[1:07:32] Amen a kingdom all right going down 25
[1:07:37] so as old world frame did not destroyed
[1:07:40] by the waters when it was washed off the
[1:07:42] frame of the planet the old frame the
[1:07:46] all the dirt all the stuff that God put
[1:07:48] on the Earth was not destroyed when the
[1:07:50] first world was destroyed and the Bible
[1:07:53] said it was destroyed
[1:07:54] but it never destroyed the frame it
[1:07:56] destroyed it just destroyed the sin and
[1:07:58] sinners that was on it the framework
[1:08:02] remain but you see now listen to this
[1:08:04] one but you see as justification as you
[1:08:07] Baptist the m just want to think of you
[1:08:09] just justification believing in being
[1:08:11] baptized that's not enough you wonder
[1:08:13] right back into the things of the world
[1:08:15] Bob your heart and wear your shorts and
[1:08:17] everything else see there is nothing
[1:08:19] happened yet just look back and seeing
[1:08:21] you done wrong what did justification do
[1:08:24] the world it never done a thing to it it
[1:08:26] started right off again just as much sin
[1:08:29] as ever it was that's the way a man does
[1:08:31] and that's all the father he goes Y what
[1:08:36] happened to the world sure it was
[1:08:38] justified but what it do started right
[1:08:40] back
[1:08:42] off amen did it change
[1:08:44] it when Jesus dropped his blood on it
[1:08:47] the world never even recognize other
[1:08:49] than a a shaking of an earthquake and
[1:08:52] and things right
[1:08:55] but it was not like even the washing
[1:08:58] when Jesus dropped his blood on the
[1:08:59] earth it didn't destroy the
[1:09:02] world and neither did it make it a fit
[1:09:04] place for God to live cuz it's still a
[1:09:07] junk right see the old framework
[1:09:13] 26 was not destroyed by the water the
[1:09:16] world was only washed off that it that
[1:09:20] got its baptism it was baptized so will
[1:09:23] the framework remain though it be burned
[1:09:25] by fire it don't destroy the Earth it
[1:09:28] just destroys the sin that's on it
[1:09:30] notice here some of you Bible students
[1:09:33] especially Dr Veil looking at me now in
[1:09:36] Peter in the second chapter of Peter
[1:09:38] here third chapter rather he uses the
[1:09:41] word world as a word Greek word Cosmos
[1:09:44] which means the world order the Earth
[1:09:45] will pass away melt the elements with
[1:09:48] firment heat see don't mean that the
[1:09:50] Earth the planet's going to pass away
[1:09:54] but the world Cosmos it don't mean the
[1:09:56] planet's going to go but the world
[1:09:58] Cosmos the Pol politics this boy that's
[1:10:01] a bad amen the Sinners and systems and
[1:10:04] sin I never realized politics this
[1:10:06] profet come along I always said that
[1:10:09] I've had my own definition of
[1:10:12] politics I know what ticks are and you
[1:10:16] know they're just blood suckers and
[1:10:17] that's what politics
[1:10:19] are but that's their business let them
[1:10:22] have they fine fun we get out of here
[1:10:25] Peter said all will melt with fervent
[1:10:27] heat and works therein burn up not the
[1:10:30] planet The Works therein The Works of
[1:10:31] man all their politicians and their
[1:10:34] schemes and all their denominations and
[1:10:36] man-made schemes will go all go with it
[1:10:39] when it burns heaven will pass away with
[1:10:41] a great noise did you notice here
[1:10:43] Heavens will pass away with a great
[1:10:45] noise listen the whole earth will be on
[1:10:47] fire and will ignite the gases in the
[1:10:50] earth and explode it exactly
[1:10:57] still on page 26 future home Peter said
[1:11:00] to S and Earth heaven and heaven will
[1:11:02] pass away and Earth with a great noise
[1:11:05] such an explosion will rock it because
[1:11:07] it's got to kill every disease every
[1:11:09] thistle every Thorn everything there is
[1:11:12] to be done the fire burn it up and
[1:11:14] remember it's not all together just a
[1:11:15] literal fire listen to it it's also a
[1:11:19] holy fire that's cor that will take away
[1:11:23] Satan and all of his all of his Devils
[1:11:27] both Heaven and Earth amen will pass
[1:11:30] away killing all the germs all the
[1:11:32] insects all the natural life on it and
[1:11:34] around it even the H2O the water will
[1:11:37] explode think about it cuz H2O is two
[1:11:39] part hydrogen one part oxygen a deadly
[1:11:43] explosive right that we didn't even
[1:11:46] realize and I don't think we still
[1:11:47] realize the stuff you go up down and
[1:11:49] drink can blow you to pieces all it's
[1:11:51] got to do is just be changed right right
[1:11:54] who knew that uh what was it it wasn't
[1:11:56] fertilizer what was the other one
[1:11:57] ammonia nitrate who knew ammonia nitrate
[1:12:00] would blow a building up right we put a
[1:12:03] lot of it on corn and it blowed the corn
[1:12:05] up you it made it grow but I never
[1:12:07] realized it bow up anything right if it
[1:12:10] had we' have had fun in our
[1:12:12] day I told you about we shot 17 sticks
[1:12:15] of dite one year that's where I don't
[1:12:18] talk about these kids about their little
[1:12:20] simple things right you it's not that
[1:12:24] way I I don't like to be what everybody
[1:12:26] think well you lived in our day we lived
[1:12:29] in a big we live in a good world we all
[1:12:31] with a bunch of
[1:12:33] junk doing the things goling down the
[1:12:40] Moonshine we knew about the herbs and
[1:12:43] the
[1:12:44] things but you see everybody wants to
[1:12:46] condemn the young people well all right
[1:12:48] it is wrong to do wrong right we know
[1:12:51] that but we done our thing we had our
[1:12:55] bell bottom pants we had our ducktail
[1:13:01] haircuts brother Dale oh yeah we look
[1:13:05] like Elvis
[1:13:08] Presley yeah Sideburn I never did have
[1:13:11] that at the duct tail I never did like
[1:13:13] Sideburn never have my own personal
[1:13:16] opinion I don't like them can't trust
[1:13:18] anybody got
[1:13:19] Sideburn that's my
[1:13:22] opinion I saw that's my
[1:13:24] opinion but now look he goes on to
[1:13:28] explain the big
[1:13:31] word and many of you want to put down
[1:13:34] this word that's page 27 the Greek word
[1:13:37] pass away it comes from the word he come
[1:13:39] to find it and it's the word p a r e r e
[1:13:42] c h o m i
[1:13:44] a and he says it doesn't mean
[1:13:47] Annihilation it means changing from one
[1:13:51] form to another amen so the word world
[1:13:53] in the days of Noah was not destroyed it
[1:13:55] changed from one form to
[1:13:58] another when this happens in the end of
[1:14:01] it it will change it from one to the
[1:14:03] other now he goes on and gives you a lot
[1:14:04] of examples he said Paul used it when
[1:14:07] you want to put it down in Titus 3 and 5
[1:14:10] Paul is using the same word means
[1:14:12] regeneration of men y that man is passed
[1:14:15] from a sinner to a saint not completely
[1:14:17] annihilated when a man's changed he
[1:14:19] isn't annihilated but he's a changed
[1:14:21] person he's been changed from what he
[1:14:24] was to what he is not annihilated Jesus
[1:14:27] used the same word I'm reading from
[1:14:29] future home page 28 Jesus used the same
[1:14:32] word Matthew 19:28 now not 281 19 1928
[1:14:37] he said to them you set with me and my
[1:14:40] king father's Kingdom regenerated the
[1:14:42] changed when you're changed he used the
[1:14:45] same word he used the same word he said
[1:14:47] when he said to the cult said loose the
[1:14:48] cat and let him go you remember that in
[1:14:51] the scripture said the same thing it's a
[1:14:52] resurrection of Lazarus loose him change
[1:14:55] him he's been tied let him go what does
[1:14:57] it mean the Earth will be loosed from
[1:14:59] the grip of Satan it'll be loosed it'll
[1:15:02] be loosed from politics it'll be loosed
[1:15:03] from denominational religious systems to
[1:15:06] be used for the kingdom of
[1:15:09] God
[1:15:12] now I want to ask you a simple
[1:15:19] question and I want you to answer from
[1:15:21] your heart not from your head
[1:15:26] a simple
[1:15:28] question do you believe the devil will
[1:15:30] be
[1:15:32] destroyed amen or is that a quote that's
[1:15:40] right cuz that's a holy fire that's
[1:15:42] going to destroy the Devil and all of
[1:15:44] his angels and
[1:15:47] everything he thank God for a
[1:15:50] prophet we wouldn't have never thought
[1:15:52] about it even though though the
[1:15:53] scripture
[1:15:55] said that Satan would be
[1:15:58] destroyed what a great God that we serve
[1:16:02] he's not going into the future home he
[1:16:05] will be there even un kept under cover
[1:16:08] in the millenum because he has nobody to
[1:16:10] work through but then he's loose for a
[1:16:12] little season he goes forth to bring
[1:16:14] forth all of the
[1:16:16] people but then in the end of it he's
[1:16:19] annihilated
[1:16:22] amen the thing you're afraid of
[1:16:28] Y will be
[1:16:30] annihilated that's
[1:16:33] right I preached a little sermon when I
[1:16:35] was in the Philippines I preached it
[1:16:36] year before when I said according to the
[1:16:40] Bible
[1:16:42] Satan will be one day like a man laying
[1:16:45] along the side of the
[1:16:47] road that's according to the
[1:16:50] Bible and said who's afraid of this man
[1:16:53] it called him a man in other words
[1:16:56] signifying right that he doesn't have
[1:16:59] his
[1:17:00] supernatural
[1:17:02] abilities that he has this day because
[1:17:04] he does have them he even passes out
[1:17:07] gifts brother bandam said Supernatural
[1:17:09] gifts Satan can do all those things he's
[1:17:11] a prince and power of the a he's do all
[1:17:13] of these different sure but what about
[1:17:15] him being destroyed
[1:17:19] amen and the Bible said you'd see him
[1:17:21] like a man laying in the
[1:17:24] ditch and Brother Dean back there in
[1:17:27] karate you know was a time he could just
[1:17:28] about jump over this
[1:17:35] building but you see Satan will be like
[1:17:38] a man laying in a ditch yeah not even
[1:17:42] enough energy to get
[1:17:44] up you afraid of
[1:17:47] him brother random
[1:17:50] saw Satan right
[1:17:54] he said he come at him saying boot he
[1:17:56] said well I'm going to just see what
[1:17:57] will happen he just booted back at
[1:18:00] it well after a while Satan was just
[1:18:06] gone Satan is our
[1:18:11] servant that's right he's not our
[1:18:15] Master he can only bring me to God and
[1:18:18] help me by attacking me pushing me
[1:18:22] through this
[1:18:24] right but he can't destroy
[1:18:29] me but there'll be a day he'll be
[1:18:31] destroyed amen so as the old saying goes
[1:18:34] you know Satan likes to remind you of
[1:18:36] your past didn't
[1:18:37] he well there's a good statement among
[1:18:40] the people of the message I don't know
[1:18:41] where it come from where it started but
[1:18:42] it's a good one said when Satan reminds
[1:18:45] you of your past remind him of his
[1:18:50] future his future will be Annihilation
[1:18:55] amen just remind him of it when he tells
[1:18:58] you about your past to say Satan what
[1:18:59] about you
[1:19:02] tomorrow what about you when God decides
[1:19:04] to destroy you oh of course he's going
[1:19:07] to tell you God can't do
[1:19:10] that but we know the
[1:19:14] truth Satan will be
[1:19:17] annihilated see the prophet said the
[1:19:19] next thing you receive was the baptism
[1:19:21] of the Holy Fire and when the Millennium
[1:19:23] is over God's going to give the world a
[1:19:25] baptism of fire it's going to blow the
[1:19:28] whole thing up the heavens and the Earth
[1:19:31] will be on
[1:19:33] fire it won't be annihilated that's
[1:19:37] right now it won't be
[1:19:43] annihilated see the reason it won't be
[1:19:45] annihilated number
[1:19:48] one it's an attribute of
[1:19:51] God we just read that
[1:19:53] didn't we you remember the quote the
[1:19:56] world is an attribute of God
[1:19:58] Amen all right then how can Satan
[1:20:01] destroy an attribute of
[1:20:05] God it can't be done
[1:20:10] amen our bodies came out of it I'm just
[1:20:14] making sensible statements that's what I
[1:20:16] like to do I like to look at something
[1:20:18] see what the prophet said see what the
[1:20:19] Bible said then make my own conclusion
[1:20:21] of course that's what people don't like
[1:20:23] they don't like you to make your own
[1:20:25] conclusions no you don't have no
[1:20:28] right amen I just make my own
[1:20:32] conclusion
[1:20:35] got if it's an attribute it cannot be
[1:20:38] destroyed that's right that's right
[1:20:41] okay and if my body came out of
[1:20:44] it come on and if it's destroyed then
[1:20:49] I'm going to have to go to Mars to get
[1:20:50] me new one that's right or so
[1:20:53] Planet that's
[1:20:55] right no brother Dale God is just going
[1:20:58] to speak well where did he speak the
[1:21:00] first from
[1:21:02] right amen he spoke our bodies right out
[1:21:05] of this Earth that's right
[1:21:07] amen no I come by Mom and Daddy yeah I
[1:21:12] did but you explain to me what that
[1:21:16] Prophet said and I'll listen to you
[1:21:19] because he said things that even you
[1:21:20] women argue about today cuz he said a
[1:21:23] woman in her thing comes down say many
[1:21:26] eggs comes down and Sh says there only
[1:21:29] one comes down now who you going to
[1:21:31] believe all you women going to believe
[1:21:33] the doctor that tells you that only one
[1:21:35] egg comes
[1:21:38] down read your profit right right he
[1:21:43] said there was millions of
[1:21:45] EGS he said there were millions of germs
[1:21:48] come down
[1:21:50] right and he said it was not the the
[1:21:52] first one it met that produced the
[1:21:56] body he said one from way in the back
[1:21:58] crawled over and come back to one way
[1:22:00] over here he said how did you wind up
[1:22:02] being a redheaded child out of all
[1:22:04] blackheaded
[1:22:05] people he said somewhere way back down
[1:22:08] through there said great great great
[1:22:10] great great grandmother was
[1:22:12] redheaded took all that time to get it
[1:22:14] out you see we're arguing with the
[1:22:19] message y well now brother D brother
[1:22:24] Brandon was just so dumb he didn't
[1:22:26] understand about the eggs now he might
[1:22:28] know about the Bible Well if he know
[1:22:31] about the Bible I think he know about
[1:22:32] the
[1:22:33] eggs you know and like I've always said
[1:22:36] they say which come first the chicken
[1:22:37] under the egg we know for sure which
[1:22:39] came first God didn't create an egg he
[1:22:41] created a chicken he didn't create a
[1:22:43] male and a female egg he created a
[1:22:46] chicken but you see sence says well we
[1:22:49] don't
[1:22:51] know I don't give a who what sence says
[1:22:55] that's right what does the Bible say
[1:22:57] what did the prophet
[1:23:01] say there's a lot of things brother
[1:23:03] random said that totally went against
[1:23:06] scientific
[1:23:08] knowledge but a lot that he said if the
[1:23:10] science would have listened to it they
[1:23:12] could have found out a lot more about
[1:23:14] right scientific knowledge if they just
[1:23:17] listen to him that's
[1:23:19] right what you see folks
[1:23:24] now I'm going to make a few statements
[1:23:25] and then we'll come back and I'll cover
[1:23:27] this again so I'll keep these notes that
[1:23:28] I've got L here
[1:23:31] now but I want you to think about
[1:23:37] something we've got a lot said about the
[1:23:40] Redemption of the
[1:23:42] soul and we believe
[1:23:44] it that it goes through justification
[1:23:46] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:23:51] Ghost and we now have things that we've
[1:23:54] read through what the prophet has said
[1:23:56] and we tried to study it to the basis of
[1:23:58] seeing that the world will go through
[1:24:00] justification sanctification and the
[1:24:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:05] amen but we got a lot of open questions
[1:24:08] there that still left in our
[1:24:13] understanding what happens to this
[1:24:21] body with can't afford to do
[1:24:25] as the brother in the message says that
[1:24:28] we'll walk out on our ashes in the
[1:24:29] Millennium now that's a big man in this
[1:24:32] message he said we literally just walk
[1:24:33] right out on on our own AES in the
[1:24:35] Millennium and then somewhere out here
[1:24:37] down by some way some P some something
[1:24:40] we going to wind up back up there with
[1:24:41] it you know and make contact well I just
[1:24:44] don't see that I'm honest I don't see it
[1:24:47] that's right because why would you want
[1:24:49] it
[1:24:50] changed why you going to change
[1:24:52] something and annihilate it why you
[1:24:53] going to resurrect something and
[1:24:54] annihilate it
[1:24:57] right see that's what I said I'm just
[1:24:59] making sensible
[1:25:02] statements well we ain't supposed to
[1:25:04] reason about the
[1:25:06] Bible I say the Bible's only things
[1:25:10] reasonable the Bible says come let us
[1:25:13] reason amen the same one says to cast
[1:25:16] down reasoning so what's he talking
[1:25:17] about cast down Mankind and his
[1:25:20] reasoning the cosmos the word order the
[1:25:23] atmospheres the situations of life
[1:25:27] right we certainly don't want to wait on
[1:25:30] our body to be
[1:25:32] redeemed in the fire that comes after
[1:25:35] the
[1:25:36] Millennium that will destroy the world
[1:25:39] right amen
[1:25:41] Cosmos we can't afford to wait that long
[1:25:43] can
[1:25:45] we so we got to know something about it
[1:25:48] and remember my statement it doesn't say
[1:25:51] that we are the adoption
[1:25:54] see you you come to the adoption of the
[1:25:57] hear ye himym and that's
[1:25:59] headstone but then there's another
[1:26:02] stage high The
[1:26:04] Headstone yep and that stage is to Wi
[1:26:07] Paul says to understand the Redemption
[1:26:10] of the body didn't say the Redemption of
[1:26:13] the
[1:26:15] world are you listening right Paul
[1:26:18] didn't say we need to understand the
[1:26:19] Redemption of the world I believe we do
[1:26:22] because they put it in the scripture but
[1:26:24] get my
[1:26:26] point there has to be a
[1:26:30] mystery and we must annihilate all
[1:26:33] things that cannot be true you know
[1:26:35] that's the way I study something you
[1:26:37] know we used to take what do you call
[1:26:38] those multiple choice or something like
[1:26:39] that multiple choice questions you know
[1:26:42] two School teachers sit back there three
[1:26:43] of them in here you know they laugh at
[1:26:45] me dmy talking about but what do you you
[1:26:50] get a multiple choice well what's a mul
[1:26:53] choice no matter what they ask you two
[1:26:55] of them is so outlandishly wrong until
[1:26:58] even a a dummy will understand that
[1:27:01] they're not right so you you just MK
[1:27:03] them to off
[1:27:05] right then you have to study on which of
[1:27:07] the two is right and we used to know you
[1:27:10] know true and false it was every other
[1:27:11] one was true and every other one was
[1:27:13] false you just get your orders and numb
[1:27:14] right but
[1:27:16] anyhow
[1:27:19] listen to get an understanding
[1:27:23] of the Redemption y of the body
[1:27:28] right I didn't make a lot of statements
[1:27:31] Sunday because I didn't
[1:27:32] want people and I'm glad the internet
[1:27:35] system went down maybe tonight cuz it'll
[1:27:38] make people want to stir up later and
[1:27:39] come back and
[1:27:41] listen but just listen to
[1:27:47] me we can't afford to wait until
[1:27:50] the Fire Fall fall over there after the
[1:27:53] Millennium right to get a glorified body
[1:27:56] right that's right
[1:27:59] amen see we have to step ahead of the
[1:28:03] world right you know why where the world
[1:28:05] can follow us amen our bodies will go
[1:28:09] ahead of the world and then the world
[1:28:11] can follow us we're the king pin in the
[1:28:14] middle what you want to call it the
[1:28:15] Keystone we're in the
[1:28:17] middle we have heard the Redemption of
[1:28:20] the soul for 2,000 years right right
[1:28:23] right but very little has been taught of
[1:28:25] mankind about the Redemption of this
[1:28:27] body that's why basically all organized
[1:28:30] religion and high for this message
[1:28:31] believe you're going to get a new one
[1:28:35] right yep where's it coming
[1:28:40] from what planet what place what
[1:28:42] position what where's it coming
[1:28:51] from
[1:28:52] see there's some keys that brother
[1:28:54] brandham
[1:28:55] made in the message of the future
[1:28:59] home to give us understanding about this
[1:29:01] bodily
[1:29:05] Redemption we've got to have a place to
[1:29:08] Anchor it
[1:29:11] to we got to have an example a TI a
[1:29:14] shadow right to
[1:29:18] precede our thinking because if not we
[1:29:20] won't be able to have it like up in the
[1:29:24] scriptures
[1:29:27] right so did you read these things in
[1:29:30] the future
[1:29:33] home or did you just read over it and
[1:29:36] say boy he's your goof
[1:29:40] there how about page
[1:29:42] 44 future home it's not on yours now
[1:29:46] don't look for
[1:29:47] it when he went up out of the water he
[1:29:50] said I saw Heavens open
[1:29:53] Now where's this
[1:29:55] at River Jordan
[1:29:57] right where everybody now saying he
[1:30:00] wasn't God he become God he thought he
[1:30:01] was God somebody's God we don't know
[1:30:03] what God
[1:30:08] is when he went up out of the water the
[1:30:10] prophet
[1:30:12] said when he went up out of the water he
[1:30:14] said I saw Heavens
[1:30:18] open the prophet saw it
[1:30:22] now who's he talking
[1:30:24] about John the
[1:30:27] Baptist he saw the heavens open and here
[1:30:30] come descending Out of
[1:30:33] Heaven a form of a
[1:30:36] dove and a voice say now what does it
[1:30:39] say over there what does it say there in
[1:30:41] the scripture about Matthew
[1:30:44] 3 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:30:47] pleased to this is my beloved Son in
[1:30:49] whom I'm pleased to dwell and Etc ET ET
[1:30:52] Etc tells you the things he
[1:30:54] does but now here's what your Prophet
[1:30:56] said it say
[1:30:58] it now let's read it and see if it
[1:31:01] changed if he changed the interpretation
[1:31:04] or was he telling us what the Bible was
[1:31:06] really
[1:31:07] saying now reading between the lines is
[1:31:10] fine as long as what you read is upon
[1:31:12] the
[1:31:13] lines correct we don't believe in
[1:31:16] Reading between the lines to get
[1:31:17] something contrary to the
[1:31:19] lines now your Prophet didn't say that
[1:31:22] he said reading between the lines is
[1:31:24] reading about Abraham and Sarah and how
[1:31:27] that they went down here and took a 300
[1:31:30] M journey and here was great here was
[1:31:33] Grandma you know yeah you know her
[1:31:36] granny call her he didn't call her
[1:31:37] grandma cuz she wasn't that time we
[1:31:38] called her granny I
[1:31:41] think and here this man comes out and he
[1:31:43] wants to take her as his
[1:31:47] wife I mean my wife I think for 69 years
[1:31:51] old is a beautiful
[1:31:53] woman I'm not saying that cuz she's here
[1:31:55] I've always told her she's pretty when
[1:31:58] her mother at 45 was solid wheh headed I
[1:32:00] thought now she get 45 she'll be wheh
[1:32:03] headed well she's
[1:32:06] not she's not whitee
[1:32:11] headed but I still don't think that too
[1:32:14] many 18y old or 20year Old Kings would
[1:32:16] want her as a wife when they could have
[1:32:18] all the others that around is that
[1:32:20] honest that's not degrading her is it
[1:32:23] now when she was 18 it's like Richard
[1:32:26] said when he saw a picture of her when
[1:32:27] she was 16 right before we married he
[1:32:29] said well you was a model she said I was
[1:32:32] I turned out to be a model
[1:32:37] wife
[1:32:39] see okay so we just read between the
[1:32:42] lines but we didn't read contrary to the
[1:32:47] line right right and we wound up reading
[1:32:51] eventually that her and Abraham that
[1:32:53] were both of them totally Beyond
[1:32:57] childbearing right Abraham done all
[1:33:00] right but he still done got to that
[1:33:02] point you know he done lost it
[1:33:04] right and when he did it says that they
[1:33:07] were both
[1:33:09] Beyond they wind up with a
[1:33:15] baby
[1:33:17] yeah Sarah dies and when he seven more
[1:33:22] kids that Abraham had or something like
[1:33:23] that he married and seven more or
[1:33:25] something
[1:33:28] right we just read between the lines
[1:33:31] didn't
[1:33:32] we we didn't read contrary to the lines
[1:33:34] cuz that's what the line
[1:33:36] said we just didn't read it
[1:33:39] right so now when we're reading Matthew
[1:33:41] that it says you know this is my beloved
[1:33:44] Son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:33:46] dwell let's read what your Prophet had
[1:33:48] to say in the future home and he went up
[1:33:50] out of the water and he said I saw
[1:33:51] Heavens open the prophet saw it he saw
[1:33:54] the heavens open and here come
[1:33:55] descending Out of Heaven a form of a
[1:33:58] dove page 44 future home and a voice
[1:34:01] saying this is my part of the earth that
[1:34:05] I have redeemed that's right and from
[1:34:08] this part of the earth I will redeem the
[1:34:11] rest of
[1:34:15] it for he is my
[1:34:18] word made manifest and the whole world I
[1:34:22] spoke it into existence by my word
[1:34:25] Hebrews 11 and Satan's held it all this
[1:34:29] time but I've come to redeem it so much
[1:34:32] of it has made his body and I'm coming
[1:34:34] to dwell in it
[1:34:36] amen now the brother R said that's what
[1:34:38] the Bible
[1:34:41] said all
[1:34:43] right now yours the catch to
[1:34:49] it 3 and 1/2 years later later he
[1:34:52] receives a
[1:34:55] change
[1:34:58] agree but God said it was redeemed
[1:35:01] that's
[1:35:04] right there was no Redemption to be
[1:35:07] brought
[1:35:09] later there was only a manifestation of
[1:35:12] what had already been spoken right
[1:35:17] amen would come into
[1:35:20] view
[1:35:23] m p 44 future
[1:35:26] home John said I saw the holy city the
[1:35:30] New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
[1:35:31] as a bride adorned for her her
[1:35:34] husband what and where did it settle on
[1:35:38] just exactly like it did there upon the
[1:35:43] Earth one day it's going to come down on
[1:35:46] Earth just like it did on earth work
[1:35:49] Jesus was part of that Earth Earth that
[1:35:51] the Holy Ghost descended upon is that
[1:35:53] right and remained upon him forever it
[1:35:56] can never leave him it's always there he
[1:35:58] and God are one always has to remain and
[1:36:01] so so John saw the holy city of the New
[1:36:04] Jerusalem descending like a comet or a
[1:36:07] dove coming out of heaven and settling
[1:36:10] Upon A redeemed entire
[1:36:14] Earth to do what to claim every
[1:36:17] attribute that he made the Earth far
[1:36:19] every man that was ever what that was
[1:36:21] represented in eternity and every woman
[1:36:23] is redeemed
[1:36:30] then
[1:36:33] now where was your body
[1:36:40] redeemed remember what we kept reading
[1:36:42] in
[1:36:44] Ephesians everything's predestinated in
[1:36:47] Jesus
[1:36:48] Christ in him before the foundation of
[1:36:51] world Amen I've kept reading that over
[1:36:54] and over and over hoping somebody jump
[1:36:56] up and say hey I see
[1:36:58] it everything we get is in Jesus Christ
[1:37:02] that's
[1:37:03] right whether it be Redemption of Soul
[1:37:05] whether it be healing for the body
[1:37:07] whether it be a body change or whether
[1:37:09] it be a world to come down and live on
[1:37:11] it's all in Jesus Christ right amen and
[1:37:14] without him we don't get anything right
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:20] okay to do what to claim every attribute
[1:37:24] that he made the Earth for every man
[1:37:26] that was represented in eternity and
[1:37:28] every woman is redeemed then she's been
[1:37:31] scoured and burned by fire Jesus in his
[1:37:35] fiery Temptations in the wilderness for
[1:37:38] 40 days after that notice it was ready
[1:37:42] for his it was ready for his ministry
[1:37:45] think of it the Holy Ghost descending
[1:37:47] upon the Earth Jesus and the Holy Blood
[1:37:50] and watch out I hope it don't go too
[1:37:52] deep for
[1:37:54] you page 19 future home now notice now
[1:37:59] as we take this this place we are to
[1:38:01] dwell in now the Andel luian repentance
[1:38:04] then brought water baptism then Jesus
[1:38:06] came and shed his blood upon it to
[1:38:09] cleanse and claim
[1:38:17] it the world are you in
[1:38:22] he dropped his blood on it to cleanse
[1:38:23] with cllean it right where was your
[1:38:27] body
[1:38:30] right okay so Brother D you got to make
[1:38:32] this live for a minute okay I will Lord
[1:38:35] willing then comes the next destruction
[1:38:37] of the world it is now and sin that's in
[1:38:39] the heavens
[1:38:46] above pick up on these other
[1:38:50] quotes
[1:38:53] let's ask you another little simple
[1:38:58] question was our
[1:39:01] bodies physical compound elements of our
[1:39:06] bodies whatever you call them 16
[1:39:08] elements pot ice petroleum
[1:39:11] Etc was that in
[1:39:19] Jesus when he stood there and the voice
[1:39:22] said this is my beloved
[1:39:24] Son our natural bodies was not in there
[1:39:28] right we don't come out of Jesus by
[1:39:30] natural uh
[1:39:32] DNA
[1:39:37] genetics true right but he redeemed that
[1:39:42] to where that he could
[1:39:44] redeem
[1:39:47] soul body that's right and the world yep
[1:39:51] would be all made in Jesus Christ
[1:39:54] right all right now that was the
[1:39:58] beginning of Jesus's Ministry we just
[1:40:01] read he was ready for his ministry right
[1:40:05] that's where these people can't
[1:40:06] understand the anointing that come on
[1:40:07] Jesus on the River Jordan that's right
[1:40:11] it was an anointing for ministry that's
[1:40:12] just simp simple because he goes right
[1:40:14] over this a little bit in in Luke about
[1:40:17] the fifth chapter fourth chapter and he
[1:40:19] said the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:40:20] because had anointed me to preach the
[1:40:22] gospel right that's
[1:40:25] simple but get to point
[1:40:31] now where does your Redemption of the
[1:40:34] body
[1:40:36] start so well it was done in Jesus
[1:40:40] Christ all right there's another one of
[1:40:42] those we don't want to wait until this
[1:40:44] that or the other
[1:40:45] form we need to
[1:40:48] understanding to it
[1:40:52] to understand the Redemption of the
[1:40:57] body not to change the change comes on
[1:41:00] an automatic process because we
[1:41:02] understand the Redemption right will you
[1:41:04] go with me that way amen the change will
[1:41:07] come because of the fact that we come to
[1:41:09] a position to know that we're redeemed
[1:41:11] and understand it will you will you go
[1:41:13] with me I don't ask you to amen cuz most
[1:41:16] of you ain't and like brother says you
[1:41:18] know amen is when you shake your head
[1:41:20] yeah you know and none of you ain't
[1:41:22] shaking your head so you ain't Amen in
[1:41:24] got one
[1:41:26] amen but think about
[1:41:30] it now what did we cover here a few
[1:41:33] months
[1:41:35] ago the Lord Jesus Christ had to have a
[1:41:39] river Jordan experience
[1:41:41] right that was his identification true
[1:41:45] that's what your Prophet called him he
[1:41:46] was identified on the River
[1:41:48] Jordan he was identified
[1:41:52] he did not have to have the new birth
[1:41:53] did he no cuz he was the new
[1:41:56] birth but he had to have that anointing
[1:41:59] to come upon him right to bring forth
[1:42:01] his ministry right now but you and I
[1:42:05] needed a new bur right so his first
[1:42:08] stage of adoption was that he started
[1:42:10] off on the River Jordan that's where
[1:42:12] your Prophet covers it now go ahead do
[1:42:14] what you want to that's
[1:42:15] right and then he comes to mount of
[1:42:18] transfiguration as to hear you him
[1:42:22] and then he goes on to the opening of
[1:42:23] the seals and has a has an understanding
[1:42:27] of the Redemption of the body right you
[1:42:30] remember that a few weeks ago when I was
[1:42:31] trying to say that you might not have
[1:42:33] been listening you want to go back and
[1:42:35] listen to some tap I've already preached
[1:42:37] most of this you remember when I tell
[1:42:39] you hey this is Mark number one you were
[1:42:41] to write it
[1:42:43] down what I say because I'll eventually
[1:42:45] get back to it huh Jesus didn't need a
[1:42:50] new birth
[1:42:52] okay but he went through that as an
[1:42:54] example right for you and I that's
[1:43:00] right and his body was redeemed right
[1:43:03] there amen 3 and 1/2 years of the most
[1:43:06] horrible time could ever be that don't
[1:43:08] have anything to do with it
[1:43:12] right he was already
[1:43:14] redeemed right
[1:43:16] amen that's why Satan couldn't touch
[1:43:19] that body
[1:43:21] Jesus Satan never killed Jesus no Roman
[1:43:25] spear killed Jesus no Jewish spear
[1:43:27] killed Jesus no beating on the back
[1:43:30] killed
[1:43:31] Jesus that's right he died of his own
[1:43:34] accord because of your sin and my sin
[1:43:38] amen that's right he paid the price
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:48] agree but see brother r said when he
[1:43:51] dropped his blood on it that cleansed
[1:43:52] and claimed it
[1:43:56] amen our bodies that were in the earth
[1:44:04] y you see it's not only just that's not
[1:44:07] used in
[1:44:10] the who is it somebody get the scripture
[1:44:12] if you can I can't remember it but see I
[1:44:14] didn't mean to go this
[1:44:16] far you receive receive the baptism of
[1:44:19] the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:21] fire right
[1:44:25] remember Holy Ghost and Fire right right
[1:44:29] you said well why does it say Holy Ghost
[1:44:30] and Fire brother R says because that
[1:44:32] fire that fire that's right comes right
[1:44:35] there as that Holy Ghost is coming in
[1:44:38] and says it burns out
[1:44:41] everything if you read the future home
[1:44:43] you heard him y said it burns out
[1:44:46] anything that was
[1:44:47] left that's right and the holy Holy
[1:44:50] Ghost comes and lives
[1:44:56] in you realize
[1:44:58] then that when Jesus set up a
[1:45:03] kingdom cuz that's what he come to bring
[1:45:05] wasn't it
[1:45:08] right when he give you the new birth
[1:45:11] Brother
[1:45:12] Gary he cleansed and claim that
[1:45:15] body he burn it out to a
[1:45:19] degree and he's still burning it out
[1:45:22] that's right cuz your Prophet says 49 of
[1:45:24] the future home that your soul is
[1:45:26] redeemed but said you're waiting the
[1:45:27] Redemption of the body he said it's
[1:45:28] growing on I've give you that quote
[1:45:31] three times already right it's growing
[1:45:36] on already started who is this
[1:45:39] MDC y he said it's already
[1:45:45] started see when he gave you the new
[1:45:47] birth right
[1:45:49] there he left lay claim on that body
[1:45:51] that you're living in yes sir Amen
[1:45:53] brother
[1:45:54] dick there's no way can ever be
[1:45:56] annihilated
[1:45:58] right you can burn it trash it do what
[1:46:01] you want to with it can't be
[1:46:03] annihilated
[1:46:06] why because he laid claim to it right
[1:46:10] that's why I believe we're not going to
[1:46:12] get a new body that's
[1:46:14] right is because the Holy Ghost come to
[1:46:17] live in this
[1:46:18] body right
[1:46:22] and now we don't like this remember a
[1:46:23] few weeks ago when I preached this way
[1:46:26] see when it says about Jesus it says
[1:46:28] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:46:30] pleased to dwell see we say one of these
[1:46:32] days I wish I could get to that place
[1:46:35] well then you don't have the new birth
[1:46:36] that's right that's right sorry right if
[1:46:39] you think one of these days you want to
[1:46:41] get to the place that that God could be
[1:46:44] pleased to dwell in you you don't have
[1:46:45] the new birth that's right because the
[1:46:48] day he gave you the new birth he come to
[1:46:50] dwell you
[1:46:52] amen put his own life exactly right
[1:46:56] redeem this body come on that's right
[1:46:59] you want
[1:47:01] scripture right you want scripture
[1:47:06] for those who
[1:47:10] Justified he ha
[1:47:13] already glorified amen well I just don't
[1:47:18] see and I'm looking that's exact what
[1:47:20] you would have done with Jesus from the
[1:47:22] River Jordan in 3 and 1/2 years of the
[1:47:24] most horrible beatings and life
[1:47:26] happenings and what he could go through
[1:47:28] with until a day come that that could be
[1:47:30] made manifest and his body would be made
[1:47:31] Eternal right you wouldn't see it back
[1:47:34] there
[1:47:38] either I don't believe in getting
[1:47:40] another
[1:47:42] body Holy Ghost is dwelling in this body
[1:47:45] right
[1:47:46] amen if you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:48] Ghost he's pleased to dwell in you
[1:47:51] now I'll say it cuz I don't mind being
[1:47:52] blunt he might not be happy about
[1:47:57] it he might not be happy about living in
[1:48:00] you and me in the bases of us being and
[1:48:02] the sin that we walk in right oh brother
[1:48:05] D ain't a sinner you know you're the
[1:48:07] biggest liar in the
[1:48:08] building that's
[1:48:12] right but he says he's pleased to
[1:48:15] dwell I've got notes one of these days I
[1:48:17] want to get back and preach on sin again
[1:48:19] I preached it here back a few years ago
[1:48:21] I want to get back on it
[1:48:25] again but see you say
[1:48:27] well what do you sin with brother
[1:48:33] Dale I say this with love in my
[1:48:39] heart if you sin
[1:48:43] today and you're a Christian if that sin
[1:48:46] is in your
[1:48:48] soul you're lost right
[1:48:50] absolutely
[1:48:52] amen but then you tell me you don't
[1:48:57] sin and then you try to justify and you
[1:49:00] say that where brother brandom said the
[1:49:03] the uh Christians are the only one that
[1:49:05] has
[1:49:06] sins you say that it don't say Born
[1:49:09] Again Christians
[1:49:13] there I'm turn it I'm twist it right
[1:49:17] that's
[1:49:19] right with love in my heart don't twist
[1:49:21] it
[1:49:24] right don't try to use scriptures like
[1:49:27] that that's
[1:49:29] right your Prophet said he sinned every
[1:49:35] day now where did he sin
[1:49:39] at was it in his body was it in his
[1:49:42] Spirit or was it in his soul right you
[1:49:45] say well we're just a soul have we come
[1:49:48] all of this way to divide Body Spirit
[1:49:50] and and soul and then want to wind up
[1:49:51] and sum it up by saying we just a
[1:49:55] soul I know that's right we are a soul
[1:49:57] we are a being
[1:50:00] right but you must divide the body
[1:50:02] spirit and soul according to Hebrews
[1:50:07] 4:12 if you sin in your soul you're lost
[1:50:10] right yes sir so where did the prophet
[1:50:13] sin if you want don't want to take
[1:50:14] anything and twist
[1:50:16] scripture quotes from the prophet he he
[1:50:20] said he sinned every day yep where did
[1:50:23] he sin
[1:50:25] at in his soul the soul that sinth it
[1:50:28] shall
[1:50:39] die all
[1:50:43] right you were probably rejoicing over
[1:50:46] the things you first
[1:50:49] heard
[1:50:50] and the talking about
[1:50:52] the body being redeemed when you receive
[1:50:56] the new
[1:50:59] birth but what about your rejoicing
[1:51:07] now I leave that
[1:51:10] we with love and respect of all
[1:51:18] things if you sin as a
[1:51:22] Christian you better make it in body and
[1:51:24] spirit right that's
[1:51:27] right but if you sin and your soul
[1:51:29] you're
[1:51:32] lost if you're just a
[1:51:35] soul then it makes you a
[1:51:42] sinner I love you let's
[1:51:48] stand
[1:51:50] you see it's to understand the
[1:51:53] Redemption of the
[1:51:57] body it's too wi to
[1:52:01] understand the Redemption of the body
[1:52:05] you know what will happen when we
[1:52:06] understand the Redemption of the
[1:52:09] body the body will be
[1:52:14] redeemed the world's not waiting on the
[1:52:17] Sons and Daughters of
[1:52:18] God
[1:52:20] to just be a signs and
[1:52:24] wonders you remember
[1:52:27] that because manifestation means
[1:52:31] what to make
[1:52:35] known signs and wond sure makes God
[1:52:38] known and we covered that no Divine
[1:52:40] Healing no
[1:52:42] Resurrection Divine healings and things
[1:52:44] is to make known God Among Us but the
[1:52:47] world is waiting on the Sons and
[1:52:49] Daughters of God God to come to a
[1:52:52] place that they understand the we

[1:52:57] body
[1:53:01] right it must start in your new
[1:53:07] birth and work its way out what we got
[1:53:11] 87 read book 87 anybody have a
[1:53:15] need let me bless Lord the

[1:54:03] every how many of you remember why
[1:54:06] brother Dale loves that
[1:54:11] song you don't base things on a dream
[1:54:13] but sometimes dreams are good aren't
[1:54:17] they I worked on a night sh gent
[1:54:22] Motors sleeping every
[1:54:25] morning and one day I dreamed a
