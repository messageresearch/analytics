[11:32] see that
[11:33] the thing is opening now to where that
[11:35] we can
[11:36] follow in the word and be led by your

[12:16] remember we're reading this because this
[12:17] is the age that we're in
[12:20] is this lady will see an age all right
[12:25] and unto the angel of the church of the
[12:27] lady of siam's right
[12:29] these things saith the amen the faithful
[12:32] and true witness
[12:34] the beginning of the creation of god
[12:37] now remember we're going trying to cover
[12:40] the beginning so that's the message to
[12:45] this
[12:45] age the beginning of the creation of god
[12:49] all right so as we transfer from one to
[12:51] the other
[12:52] follow that that we're all in the basis
[12:55] of a new creation
[12:59] a new race if we'll just understand it
[13:02] okay let's go
[13:03] to second corinthians just pick up one
[13:06] scripture
[13:07] 5 17.
[13:11] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[13:13] new creature
[13:15] old things are passed away behold all
[13:17] things
[13:19] are become new amen you may be seated
[13:22] lord at his blessing remember over in
[13:24] the book of revelations
[13:25] it's it covers how that all things are
[13:28] made new
[13:29] well then here we read here in
[13:31] corinthians that all things are made new
[13:34] so then we should be uh getting to a
[13:37] place or seeing
[13:39] at least the hour and the day that we're
[13:41] here now
[13:42] i i want to refer back just a little bit
[13:47] to the couple of messages back when we
[13:50] preached
[13:50] you know and talking about the
[13:54] overcomer and and all of the things and
[13:57] i want you to think about
[13:59] all that uh we tried to cover we
[14:02] we tried to bring out that uh you know
[14:05] we
[14:05] we want to see things in a positive
[14:07] attitude
[14:09] positive right now you realize where
[14:12] we're at right now that's what
[14:14] my point was and that whole message was
[14:16] to get us to see
[14:20] that if we could be back there in
[14:23] in hitler's time you know we could say
[14:25] we we saw that
[14:27] we we we lived in that time mussolini's
[14:30] time the
[14:31] the world and all of the things were the
[14:34] things the prophet saw that would take
[14:36] place
[14:37] you realize that there's people in this
[14:39] building that has lived through that
[14:42] you know some younger ones some older
[14:45] ones but still
[14:46] living that thing it's not something
[14:49] that we're looking forward to
[14:51] we've done seen these things transpire
[14:55] all right and the prophet got in there
[14:57] remember and he brought it out and
[14:58] he came down to the number five in the
[15:01] division and
[15:02] and he said now five of these things has
[15:04] been fulfilled well the fifth one was
[15:07] the car and the situation and all and
[15:10] you and i have
[15:11] experienced that we've lived our time
[15:13] and we've seen the volkswagen come into
[15:16] view
[15:16] we've seen the the roads made for to be
[15:20] able to drive without a
[15:21] steering wheel or anything we've seen a
[15:23] lot of those things transpire in our day
[15:28] well we ought to be happy
[15:31] to say we are in the bible
[15:35] you remember i kept asking the question
[15:36] through that service
[15:38] can you put your experience in the bible
[15:44] can you i mean can you really just think
[15:46] about
[15:48] where you're at well if i could find my
[15:51] name written there
[15:54] i like the way we was listening the
[15:55] other night to the prophet when he said
[15:58] uh he said when the bible says whosoever
[16:02] he said i'm glad it says that he said
[16:05] because
[16:06] if it said william branham he said
[16:08] there's other william branhams
[16:10] well it said when it says whosoever said
[16:13] then that's me
[16:14] well all right then that's the way we
[16:16] should think about our christian
[16:18] experience
[16:20] as to living things in our lives right
[16:22] now
[16:23] he said well boy wouldn't it be great to
[16:25] be back there with the apostles
[16:28] and and and all of the things wouldn't
[16:30] it be great to
[16:32] to stand in the hour of a lot of that
[16:34] like the book of acts and the great
[16:36] things to take in place well
[16:39] why would you want to go back why not
[16:42] stand here and believe
[16:44] the same god well not believe the same
[16:47] things were taking place
[16:51] when i just see those things and see how
[16:54] it's doing yeah but i just don't see
[16:56] well that's what i've emphasized to you
[16:59] through that message that a lot of you
[17:03] your kids you wouldn't be old enough to
[17:05] know about hitler
[17:06] what you've heard about him you can get
[17:09] videos and documentaries and all kind of
[17:12] things
[17:12] about him that would be just a little
[17:15] prior to your age
[17:17] but then some of the the adults into
[17:19] that age we'd fit into that bracket to
[17:22] actually maybe lived some of you during
[17:25] the times of world war one world war
[17:27] ii yeah and and
[17:30] you know experiencing those things to
[17:33] actually
[17:34] live it and that's a wonderful
[17:38] opportunity
[17:39] to be able to see that and he said i
[17:42] gave you the quotes where he said
[17:43] five of the things has transpired all
[17:46] right what did he say number six was
[17:52] he said a woman in the white house said
[17:56] maybe the catholic church what said
[17:59] maybe uh vice president or president
[18:03] or that he put them both there in
[18:07] to where we can see that you and i have
[18:10] experienced that we've come up in an age
[18:13] now where there's a woman in the white
[18:14] house
[18:17] you don't rejoice to think about that
[18:20] that
[18:20] the the god has told us ahead of time
[18:26] what would transpire that doesn't thrill
[18:30] you to be able to
[18:32] uh be able to pick up a newspaper and
[18:34] read tomorrow's news
[18:36] today you know
[18:41] you know what i'm talking about to where
[18:42] that we could see the things that's
[18:44] transpiring
[18:46] is written right in the word of god
[18:50] in order to make our hearts rejoice
[18:53] to be able to comprehend something
[18:56] before it ever takes place
[19:01] right and to see it all right
[19:04] see i wanted you to see that i wanted
[19:06] you to to tie it together with
[19:08] with the things that where we are
[19:10] because
[19:11] my way of seeing things i i i look at
[19:14] things in a positive attitude
[19:18] because when i look at it in a negative
[19:21] you know well when i look at it at all
[19:24] if you're not going to look at it
[19:25] positive
[19:27] if you're not going to believe he's
[19:28] hebrews 13 8 while we're about to rest
[19:33] to believe and see the very moment that
[19:36] we're living
[19:38] is right in the scriptures
[19:43] being made manifest right now
[19:47] on the earth and i like what the prophet
[19:49] said about it he said
[19:51] uh and the lord jesus said of what they
[19:53] say the last
[19:54] seven hours i believe that's right now
[19:56] but anyhow it's the last few hours of
[19:59] before there in in calvary taking place
[20:01] he said that fulfilled the biggest
[20:03] portion of the scriptures
[20:06] was right there and he went back and
[20:07] quote in the old testament scriptures
[20:09] they pierced my hands my feet they've
[20:11] done this that the other
[20:13] and see he could rejoice to see that
[20:16] he could comprehend that those things
[20:19] had taken
[20:20] place well can you do that that's why i
[20:22] kept asking the question
[20:24] do you believe hitler was here do you
[20:26] believe mussolini happened
[20:27] do you believe the car came do you
[20:29] believe the the things were taking place
[20:33] do you believe that there's a woman in
[20:35] the white house
[20:36] a vice president or president
[20:40] no you say well that was a catholic
[20:43] church
[20:45] now i ask you a question about it and
[20:47] then i'll get away from it
[20:49] you say oh that's a catholic church well
[20:52] it was a time you used to be looking for
[20:54] a woman
[20:57] i'm too old for you to play with me
[20:59] about it
[21:01] i remember talking with you about it and
[21:03] us discussing it
[21:05] and talking about a woman in the white
[21:08] house
[21:10] we wasn't interested in the catholic
[21:13] form of in the white house
[21:16] we was interested in the woman in the
[21:18] white house
[21:20] all right but see now you have the woman
[21:22] and the catholics in the white house
[21:25] now you have them both you have
[21:26] everything there's no
[21:28] reason for us to deny to doubt anything
[21:31] that was said by the prophet because
[21:33] it's transferred right before us
[21:40] but what i'm saying is we was looking at
[21:43] it like
[21:44] a woman and not looking at the catholic
[21:48] right coming down people would do it see
[21:50] i live through this
[21:51] i hope you think about the days you
[21:53] lived through it and what you've been
[21:54] through
[21:56] that people didn't talk about
[21:59] the catholics in the white house they
[22:00] talked about the woman coming into the
[22:02] white house
[22:05] well now she's there
[22:10] but you see god does it in some a
[22:12] marvelous way
[22:13] until he put them both right in together
[22:15] the woman and the catholics
[22:20] you don't you don't that don't throw you
[22:25] that don't
[22:26] give you an understanding that god
[22:28] thought enough of you
[22:30] to tell you about these things and what
[22:32] was going to take place
[22:34] before they ever took place
[22:40] that he sent a man with dust saith the
[22:42] lord that's right
[22:43] amen amen that's right
[22:46] to tell us all of these things
[22:50] that don't make you feel good
[22:54] what makes me feel good is my father
[22:56] thought enough of me to tell me these
[22:58] things
[23:00] you don't think anyway you don't think
[23:02] that your father
[23:04] almighty god made a way in this last
[23:08] days
[23:09] for us to be able to see these things
[23:15] and see them right in our in front of us
[23:17] transfer
[23:18] i mean just walk right up to the white
[23:20] house and say there it is
[23:23] see so what are we going to do now
[23:27] well as i said we were looking for the
[23:29] woman in the white house
[23:30] now the woman's in the white house what
[23:32] are we going to do now well oh but
[23:33] that's not the woman in the
[23:35] this is not the woman uh it's the
[23:37] catholic church in the white house
[23:40] see you turn it right back around
[23:43] you're doing what i said the joke was
[23:45] made
[23:47] when it started out about the woman in
[23:49] the white house
[23:51] and how that i won't call her name
[23:53] because there's no need to call her
[23:54] names but
[23:55] she was running for president but she
[23:58] wasn't too pretty
[24:01] and everybody started a big life and
[24:03] joking way of things
[24:04] talking about well that can't be the one
[24:07] he's talking about because he said a
[24:08] beautiful woman
[24:09] said that woman ain't beautiful
[24:12] a joke
[24:17] has this gospel become a joke
[24:22] are you looking at it as pro present
[24:25] positive
[24:26] perfect tense
[24:30] to see it right among you or if i'd have
[24:32] just been back there
[24:37] no according to the prophet
[24:40] if we say if we'd just been back there
[24:42] he said whatever you're doing now is
[24:44] what you'd have done then
[24:46] is that right now whatever we're doing
[24:50] we would have done then
[24:54] all right let's get serious about it
[24:57] okay because i'm looking at it as
[25:00] positive as
[25:01] as something that is more real to me
[25:04] today
[25:05] this message means more to me today than
[25:08] it ever has in my life
[25:09] because i'm seeing it made alive
[25:15] i'm seeing it living in people
[25:19] i see it making manifest
[25:25] why would you prophet say it like that
[25:27] see he said
[25:29] a vice president
[25:33] well i mean we know the channels but why
[25:35] didn't he say a president
[25:38] a woman president i will tell you what
[25:42] he went on and said if you'll listen and
[25:43] read
[25:44] he went on and said the woman to be the
[25:46] controlling factor
[25:48] so it don't matter who the president is
[25:55] the woman has got the control in power
[26:00] she's the one right she's in office
[26:03] right well we still got a little bit of
[26:06] time over what
[26:08] february jennifer or something
[26:12] but what are you going to do you're
[26:13] going to try to get in the ark
[26:16] do you remember what the prophet said he
[26:20] said some of those people were serious
[26:22] people would listen another night to it
[26:24] he said some of those people were
[26:26] serious people
[26:28] he said you know what they went up to
[26:30] where the ark was
[26:32] because they even said now we know that
[26:35] if the door closes
[26:36] noah is a good man and he'll open the
[26:39] door and let us
[26:40] in now that's that's what your prophet
[26:43] said
[26:46] is that the way we are
[26:51] oh everything's going to be all right
[26:53] brother dale you're a doomsday
[26:54] i'm not doomsday i'm very very proud you
[26:57] can't
[26:58] you can't be a doomsday uh thoughts of
[27:01] things
[27:02] and be excited about it
[27:05] right i mean you're excited about
[27:07] getting your head blowed off
[27:10] no no don't go that way you don't get
[27:13] excited over that you get excited when
[27:15] you realize those things happening
[27:17] right now that has been promised for 6
[27:20] 000 years
[27:24] we're not looking for whether hitler
[27:25] would come into view or not
[27:28] we're not looking where the mussolini's
[27:30] or whatever it would be
[27:33] we're looking at what the prophet said
[27:35] thus saith the lord
[27:37] she's in the white house
[27:44] okay now if the woman's in command what
[27:47] does it matter who this
[27:48] first guy is if she's a second you
[27:51] understand what i'm saying
[27:52] why would the prophet say vice president
[27:55] why didn't he go right straight
[27:56] president because you know why that's
[27:59] too much that's too
[28:01] too hard so the woman's going to have to
[28:03] ease herself
[28:04] in the white house as the vice president
[28:12] but she's going to rule the show
[28:16] when it's all finished where are we
[28:18] going to be okay
[28:23] i'm just one thing that i'm thankful for
[28:26] all things
[28:29] that my savior has shown me that my god
[28:31] has over the years shown me
[28:33] that i've not fallen after all of these
[28:36] flim-flam things this went about in the
[28:38] message
[28:41] that's what i said you get people you go
[28:43] back there and think about it some of
[28:44] your older ones
[28:46] when they get up and they say well this
[28:48] can't be that woman in the white house
[28:49] because she's still too ugly
[28:52] that was more important to them then
[28:55] than the gospel of the fact of realizing
[29:00] that in just a few years you would be
[29:02] living those things
[29:04] you would be fulfilling those things
[29:08] right in your life
[29:14] i'm going to say it but forget what i'm
[29:17] saying about it
[29:18] i ain't saying well you voted it
[29:23] because some of you probably did vote
[29:25] for it
[29:26] that's your opinion that ain't nothing
[29:27] to me that ain't got nothing to do with
[29:29] that that's natural
[29:32] that's natural points that's that's
[29:40] but what about voting to put in
[29:45] see that's why i quit voting when i
[29:48] learned this message and said who was
[29:51] when did he run on kennedy when was the
[29:55] last time
[29:57] 63 or something got killed you know
[30:01] but i never voted since then on a
[30:03] presidential election why
[30:09] because i read where the prophet said
[30:12] one of those
[30:13] visions they would deal with
[30:16] a president coming into office by the
[30:19] women's votes and the things
[30:22] i'm just reading it today
[30:27] and since that when i found out what
[30:29] they've done with john l kennedy i never
[30:31] voted since then because ain't no need
[30:32] of it come on
[30:36] you've lived some of you've lived long
[30:38] enough to realize that when they even
[30:40] uh the edgar hoover wouldn't the ones
[30:43] that he tried to bring it out
[30:45] but they couldn't even bring it out when
[30:46] he was devoting for one you were
[30:48] automatically voting for the other
[30:49] person
[30:50] and they knew it
[30:55] you think i'm gonna vote anymore
[30:59] like i said in that message the other
[31:00] day
[31:02] when i began to hear the message and and
[31:04] the prophet was talking about
[31:05] i didn't run to see about the women's
[31:07] run
[31:09] but i began to study as much as i could
[31:11] to find out
[31:12] and i found out that this was like 1967.
[31:16] give or take a little that at that time
[31:20] there was 1500
[31:22] catholics in the white house appointees
[31:26] and things like that
[31:27] that a lot of them was appointed for
[31:28] life
[31:31] see that was what i was interested in
[31:34] i was interested in seeing how the
[31:36] catholic's going to get in the wild
[31:39] i wasn't concerned about the woman
[31:44] i was concerned about the catholics
[31:48] and i never voted no more
[31:52] i ain't saying anything wrong with your
[31:54] voting see that's where you'll do that
[31:56] in your mind and then you'll build your
[31:57] good case
[32:01] well i think i've proved my point all
[32:03] the way down to where i've stood for
[32:05] and what i've stood for and the things
[32:07] that i've based it on
[32:09] from the day one of this message here in
[32:11] this church
[32:12] until where we are now because you know
[32:14] what the message was
[32:16] going beyond man's camp that was the
[32:20] first sermon i preached
[32:22] in this message was going beyond
[32:27] man's camp and by the way
[32:31] if you'd like to have a whole section of
[32:34] cassette tapes that probably you could
[32:37] find them everyone from 82 back
[32:40] because there's about six boxes
[32:42] downstairs
[32:43] of cassette tapes you're welcome to
[32:46] every one of them
[32:47] if you don't get them we're going to
[32:49] burn them
[32:51] because we ain't got nowhere to put them
[32:53] we're going to trash them if we don't do
[32:55] it
[32:55] if you want them go down there and get
[32:56] every one of them
[32:58] if you want to know what i preached in
[33:00] 1975
[33:02] go down there and look through those
[33:03] boxes and you'll find it
[33:07] i guess i should really take them and
[33:09] bundle them up and set them up somewhere
[33:11] just in case but i ain't worried about
[33:12] it
[33:13] because hey most of you have been here
[33:15] long enough to know what i've preached
[33:16] in 75.
[33:21] see a lot of you know what in 1974 when
[33:25] i said you could pass night
[33:26] the year 2026 and not break the
[33:28] prophet's word
[33:32] do you want the tapes they're downstairs
[33:35] welcome to them because like i said if
[33:36] you don't
[33:37] we're going to take them to the trash
[33:38] pile we can't leave them sitting down
[33:40] there
[33:42] all right okay now
[33:46] let's get on with the message
[33:49] the next message or the last part that i
[33:52] was trying to bring about the message
[33:54] that i've been endeavoring to bring on
[33:57] the beginning of the creation
[34:01] i covered a little part there that i
[34:04] want you to go back with me and think
[34:07] about these things
[34:08] and if you'll go to that tape you'll
[34:10] find that i covered
[34:12] stage one and stage two to a degree
[34:15] and then left it because i did not have
[34:17] enough time
[34:19] at that time to get to stage three uh
[34:22] so that's even the statement in the
[34:24] message there
[34:25] all right now
[34:30] covering the beginning of creation
[34:34] that's what i like i picked that that's
[34:36] random that's very wordy
[34:38] the scripture says beginning of the
[34:40] creation of god what brother branham
[34:42] called it says beginning of creation
[34:46] all right see then revelation 3 14
[34:51] has a threefold
[34:56] understanding to it
[35:00] the beginning of the creation of god has
[35:02] a threefold
[35:04] understanding to it
[35:07] stage one
[35:11] was god coming into creation himself
[35:18] making himself known
[35:23] all right stop now i'm going to pick
[35:27] that up in a minute but i want to go on
[35:28] stage two covers the coming into being
[35:33] of the word
[35:34] that was made flesh in the body
[35:38] of the lord jesus christ being the
[35:40] beginning of the creation
[35:44] the body all right
[35:48] stage three which we didn't get to
[35:52] is the the new creation which is what i
[35:55] read the scriptures there in corinthians
[35:57] he's a new creature
[36:01] if you're a born again believer tonight
[36:03] you're a new creature
[36:06] you're not an old creature made over
[36:10] you're a new creature in christ jesus
[36:15] all right if i don't get to that we'll
[36:16] finish it up on that part
[36:18] but i want you to think about it
[36:21] because stage one
[36:27] now i tried to cover it in the message
[36:29] if you'll listen you'll see that i
[36:31] brought it up but i was walking
[36:33] very slowly because i couldn't find the
[36:35] right way
[36:36] and i said there a couple of times that
[36:38] i'm trying to find a way to present this
[36:40] to
[36:41] what did i see
[36:44] but i want to start off with presenting
[36:46] it like this
[36:48] let's just read what your prophet says
[36:49] on two or three things and then
[36:51] make some comments so go ahead brothers
[36:52] we're number one on the
[36:56] now i gave you these before so don't
[36:59] worry too much about it
[37:02] questions and answers on genesis
[37:05] now look what he says and no man has
[37:08] seen the father at any time
[37:10] no man can see god in the bodily form
[37:18] because god is not in bodily body form
[37:25] that's why it'll clear up the scriptures
[37:27] where god is a spirit
[37:29] and they that worship him
[37:33] but he's it's not a spirit like a spook
[37:35] floating around
[37:37] he's a being he's a person
[37:41] but i want you to catch something in a
[37:43] minute when you get through for just a
[37:44] little bit of the message
[37:46] and you'll see what i've been driving at
[37:49] and even gaining ground on my own
[37:52] no man can see god in the bodily form
[37:55] because god is not in body form
[37:57] god is a spirit see all right no man has
[38:01] seen the father
[38:04] scripture right no man can see the
[38:07] father
[38:09] the son has to declare him
[38:13] you can't see the father because he's
[38:14] spirit all right
[38:16] see he's spirit right now even though
[38:19] he's went through the forms and
[38:20] everything
[38:21] he's still the holy spirit that's within
[38:22] your heart
[38:25] right see all right no man has seen the
[38:28] father
[38:29] but the only begotten of the father hath
[38:31] declared him
[38:32] first john now but notice now there's
[38:36] nothing there's
[38:37] just space all right
[38:40] now hold on to what we're getting here
[38:43] read that very carefully and listen
[38:46] listen to what's being said now
[38:50] but this is a specific time that we'll
[38:53] get to in a second when we're reading
[38:56] but now notice now there's nothing
[38:59] there's just space
[39:02] there's no light there's no dark there's
[39:05] no nothing
[39:07] it just seems nothing
[39:10] okay but in there
[39:14] is a great supernatural being jehovah
[39:16] god
[39:17] who covered all space of all places at
[39:20] all times
[39:22] he was from the from everlasting from
[39:24] everlasting
[39:26] he is the beginning of creation
[39:30] now listen
[39:33] there was a time that god was
[39:35] self-existing
[39:37] right that's the elohim
[39:40] right the understanding self-existing he
[39:43] dwelt alone
[39:46] nobody was back there with him we wasn't
[39:48] back there as little bitty people as the
[39:49] mormons believed
[39:50] running around up in heaven with god no
[39:54] he wasn't there if he's self-existing
[39:57] then he's self-existing
[40:00] does that need interpretation
[40:04] when you say self-existing that means
[40:06] he's by himself
[40:10] all right but don't
[40:13] no don't take him so far until you take
[40:16] him clean out of the story
[40:18] because that's what we want to get to
[40:20] all right
[40:22] that's god can't see nothing can't hear
[40:25] nothing
[40:26] not a move or an atom in the air not
[40:28] nothing
[40:30] not no iron no no nothing
[40:33] but yet god was there
[40:37] that was god now let's watch for a few
[40:39] minutes and after a while no man has
[40:41] seen
[40:42] that now that's the father that's
[40:45] god the father all right
[40:49] a self-existing
[40:52] he existed alone there was nothing with
[40:54] him
[40:55] no light no night no day no darkness no
[40:58] this
[40:59] no father son and holy ghost and this
[41:01] that and the other no no
[41:04] no
[41:07] it was god dwelling alone
[41:11] brother branham said god was lonely
[41:14] i love that
[41:19] he said that's what he'd done in the
[41:20] garden he's because adam was lonely
[41:25] so he took part and made eve
[41:29] so what did god do god was lonely
[41:34] so he started a condescending down
[41:37] toward
[41:38] mankind to where that he could be
[41:40] understood
[41:46] he didn't become another person a second
[41:48] person coming into view or third person
[41:50] or anything like that
[41:51] he was almighty god himself all the way
[41:53] from the beginning
[41:54] the self-existing one
[41:59] i wish i could get it together when i
[42:01] was listening to him today when he was
[42:03] saying that that the people believing in
[42:07] evolution
[42:08] he said how come it ain't evolved
[42:10] anymore you know
[42:11] all right that was a good point but
[42:13] brother random made a statement
[42:16] that was so outstanding i thought how in
[42:18] the world could that man with no
[42:20] education say that
[42:23] he said you say well that was
[42:28] you know they evoluted
[42:33] he said well let's just take another
[42:36] word
[42:38] he said
[42:42] you got a mule
[42:46] he said now mew
[42:50] said he can't reproduce himself
[42:58] now did it click
[43:04] a mule can't reproduce
[43:09] where are you going to put him in the
[43:10] evolution theory
[43:15] you see how smart that man seventh grade
[43:18] education
[43:19] standing there making a state but i
[43:22] thought
[43:22] god how could it just stupidity of
[43:25] mankind to not
[43:26] understand that if you've got a mule
[43:32] something ended right because he can't
[43:36] reproduce himself
[43:38] he said now why i've used it why have
[43:40] you people you're
[43:42] you're a scientist why haven't you
[43:43] thought of that
[43:45] i said that i thought
[43:48] god you could put into the mind of a
[43:52] little old man
[43:55] a scientific fact
[44:01] you understand what i just said a
[44:03] scientific fact
[44:06] that the mule can't be reproduced
[44:10] well then how could it be evolving
[44:13] who did he evolve from and where did he
[44:15] evolve to go to the next state
[44:19] oh god
[44:24] amen just help us lord amen
[44:29] now look what i'm talking about then
[44:33] this being that we talk about
[44:37] coming into being back before the
[44:41] foundational world before there was
[44:42] anything
[44:44] but yet it was god
[44:48] all right go ahead to number two while
[44:52] we're tied these two together
[44:54] because we're on stage one now stage one
[44:57] is before the foundational world
[45:00] see i didn't even catch that when i
[45:03] preached that sermon
[45:05] i caught it sitting in the office a
[45:06] minute ago
[45:08] i thought god how stupid i am
[45:13] there's the answer
[45:16] listen now if god created man in his own
[45:20] image and in his own likeness
[45:23] what kind of a man did he create how
[45:25] many times have you heard that
[45:29] and what did he create a spirit man
[45:34] why did he create a spirit man because
[45:36] god is a spirit
[45:40] father spirit
[45:46] before the world he was father spirit he
[45:48] was spirit
[45:50] he was already father son and holy ghost
[45:53] he didn't have to become these things
[45:56] he brought them into manifestation
[46:02] in life but listen
[46:05] now if you'll notice after he had made
[46:07] all the creation and created a spirit
[46:09] man
[46:10] the close reading of this now to the one
[46:12] that asks the question
[46:14] you'll find this that god gave dominion
[46:16] of the cattle and the fishes and
[46:18] everything
[46:19] to the man but it is making up he made
[46:23] man in his own image to lead the cattle
[46:26] now how is he going to lead the cattle
[46:27] by the holy spirit
[46:28] not by his natural leading right leading
[46:30] the beast of the field just like the
[46:32] holy spirit leads the believer
[46:34] today right
[46:39] he was in other words adam the first
[46:42] man in the lower
[46:46] creation of god why did he bring it in
[46:48] the lower
[46:49] creation
[46:53] because an easier way to say the first
[46:55] man that was created human
[47:01] is the lower creation amen are you with
[47:04] me
[47:05] adam was a human being but he first made
[47:08] him a spirit being
[47:10] because that would be the same where the
[47:12] father would be all right
[47:14] that's right right but then he would
[47:17] come into natural
[47:18] the first creation was god himself
[47:22] oh but i don't understand that how could
[47:25] god create
[47:26] god god didn't create god god is the
[47:29] creator of all things
[47:30] he is that god
[47:38] see this is still before the
[47:40] foundational world he said wait a minute
[47:41] adam the first man in the lower creation
[47:44] you put him in flesh he's fine but you
[47:46] got him in spirit first
[47:49] right he's a spirit before he's in flesh
[47:53] come on why because he's in the image of
[47:55] god the first creation was god himself
[47:58] whatever god was
[48:02] adam was
[48:05] and we're not talking physical right
[48:08] remember it's before it's what i said i
[48:10] didn't catch that to how to
[48:11] to bring it i knew the stages the three
[48:13] stages
[48:15] but remember this stage stays totally
[48:19] before the foundation of the world or
[48:21] before time began
[48:22] our things begin etc
[48:26] then the next is a body starts coming
[48:28] into being
[48:31] see that's all right then but look the
[48:34] first creation was god himself
[48:38] then out of god came the logos still
[48:41] before the world
[48:43] which was the son of god still before
[48:45] the world
[48:48] then out of the logos which was the word
[48:50] for the foundational world
[48:51] in the beginning was the word and the
[48:53] word was with god and the word was god
[48:55] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[48:57] among us out of the logos came forth the
[49:00] man the creator
[49:05] the son of god
[49:10] you remember and i asked the question
[49:11] years ago i said you're talking about
[49:13] son of man but who knows when the son of
[49:15] god come into being
[49:17] you realize the son of god had come into
[49:19] being before the world ever become into
[49:21] being
[49:21] because he's the one that created it
[49:24] according to the bible it says all
[49:26] things were made by him and without him
[49:28] there was not anything
[49:29] made that was made who
[49:32] jesus christ the word not the flesh man
[49:37] that comes stage two
[49:42] we're still in stage one but back before
[49:46] the foundation of the world
[49:51] right
[49:54] adam the first man in the lower creation
[49:56] of god
[49:59] spirit man the first creation was god
[50:02] himself
[50:03] spirit man not spirit man coming into
[50:05] but he began to come into being
[50:08] he began to make himself manifest
[50:11] that's why it calls him the new creation
[50:16] because that's what he is
[50:21] okay come on follow me now
[50:24] go ahead to number three
[50:30] and notice then after a while i began to
[50:32] see a little sacred light
[50:34] begin to form like a little halo or
[50:36] something you you could see
[50:38] only see it by spiritual eye
[50:41] spiritual eyes to look now
[50:45] while we're looking the whole church now
[50:48] we're standing on a great big banister
[50:51] watching what god's doing
[50:53] and we'll get right down to this
[50:56] question here
[50:57] and you'll see how that he brings it in
[51:02] now no one has seen god
[51:06] no problem because god's a spirit
[51:10] you can't see a spirit
[51:15] and now the next thing we begin to see
[51:17] by eyes of supernatural looking
[51:19] we see a little white light forming out
[51:21] there
[51:25] that's god coming into manifestation
[51:31] that's the logos the word the son of god
[51:34] all things
[51:34] that's god manifesting himself in a way
[51:37] that you can comprehend him
[51:39] amen
[51:47] we see a little white light forming what
[51:49] is that that was called by bible readers
[51:51] logos
[51:52] or the anointed or the anointing or
[51:55] as i was going to say the the part of
[51:58] god began to develop
[52:00] now listen into something so human
[52:03] beings
[52:04] could have some type of an idea what it
[52:07] was
[52:10] wonderful wording seventh grade
[52:16] education right
[52:22] began to develop into something so human
[52:25] beings could have
[52:27] some type of an idea what it was that's
[52:29] right was a little
[52:30] little light moving he that was the word
[52:33] of god
[52:34] now god gave himself birth to his son
[52:41] no problem which was before there was
[52:44] even the adam in the or the air to make
[52:47] an
[52:48] atom that was see jesus said glorify me
[52:52] father with the glory that we had before
[52:55] the foundation of the world
[52:56] see way back in yonder
[53:00] what did he do god gave himself birth to
[53:03] his son
[53:07] the word
[53:10] the word come into being not come into
[53:12] being because it was not into being
[53:14] but it come into manifestation or to
[53:16] place the word it could be comprehended
[53:21] god has been unveiling himself down
[53:23] through time
[53:24] to try to get you and me to be able to
[53:26] see him
[53:32] as i said the other day when i was
[53:33] talking about it i was glad that god
[53:35] didn't send a theologian to that dream
[53:38] i'm glad of that i'm glad he didn't send
[53:40] that we all have problems trying to
[53:42] understand
[53:44] you say we have problems trying to
[53:46] understand we may do it but we're not
[53:47] having problems as much as you would if
[53:49] you messed it up with a theologian
[53:51] and put him in there i'm not against
[53:53] theologies
[53:54] or nothing i'm just telling you the
[53:56] truth
[53:58] all right let's see if i can keep this
[54:01] there
[54:02] all right
[54:08] let's just keep it on one thought
[54:12] now no problems preaching i can preach
[54:15] for 10 years off
[54:16] i mean if that's what i said if you want
[54:18] to if you want to go back here
[54:19] if you want to thumb down to listen
[54:22] there's probably about 2 000
[54:24] tape boxes sitting down there in the
[54:25] bottom take that and listen to see if
[54:28] that's what i was preaching
[54:29] 40 years ago
[54:37] no problems no bragging
[54:40] just telling the truth
[54:44] if not somebody come and show me where i
[54:46] changed it you've got the tapes
[54:48] downstairs welcome to them take them and
[54:51] listen to them
[54:52] and see if there's any difference in
[54:53] what i was preaching then and what i'm
[54:54] preaching now
[54:56] i ain't talking about depth now because
[54:58] it keeps unveiling
[55:00] just like i said i was sitting in there
[55:01] a while ago and the lord just
[55:03] cleared that up and brought it out
[55:07] three stages stage one was before the
[55:11] foundation of the world
[55:13] god came into being adam listen down
[55:17] you're gonna
[55:18] swallow hard adam's spiritual man was
[55:21] created before the world ever begun
[55:25] spiritual man of adam our spirit
[55:32] was brought into being before the world
[55:34] ever begun
[55:37] there's your genesis 1 26 and 27.
[55:45] first you let us make man in our own
[55:47] image
[55:52] let him have dominion it was not the
[55:54] natural atom to have dominion
[55:56] we don't need dominion over animals
[56:02] we need to be is just what we are
[56:08] right what are you following me now
[56:15] god gave himself birth to his son
[56:23] before the world ever begun
[56:30] but that's not a person coming into
[56:32] being
[56:33] that's a dividing or a multiplying of
[56:36] that person
[56:37] that was into being that was in the
[56:40] beginning before the world ever begun
[56:49] be real careful just don't cross
[56:52] yourself
[56:54] on your predestination
[56:58] just keep your predestination running
[57:00] straight
[57:02] that god by foreknowledge
[57:05] for new yeah
[57:11] but he foreign knew what you'd do
[57:14] he foreknew what he was going to do
[57:18] he was going to make adam as a spiritual
[57:20] man
[57:23] then one day he would make adam as a
[57:25] natural man
[57:29] oh he knew that he would come into being
[57:34] as
[57:34] a spiritual being father
[57:40] be the father that could not be seen
[57:44] nor comprehended but he would have to
[57:48] condescend and if he would then he would
[57:51] condescend into the word form
[57:56] and then it's so marvelous that word
[57:58] form would be the son
[58:03] the son would be the one that created
[58:05] all things
[58:11] come on not the flesh man the
[58:14] flesh man the lord jesus is stage two we
[58:17] have to get into that and back up
[58:22] stage one we're standing back before the
[58:23] foundation of the world
[58:25] and seeing that the father
[58:28] already had brought into being in his
[58:31] mind what he was going to do
[58:35] now you got your predestination running
[58:37] correct
[58:44] that he predestinates by his
[58:46] foreknowledge
[58:49] he knew what would happen when he made
[58:51] this man adam
[58:55] but he made him a spiritual man first
[59:00] now let me tell you let me say it this
[59:02] way to you according to blasphemous 9
[59:04] brother brown said that adam's soul was
[59:06] eternal
[59:08] all right now you can read all you want
[59:10] to
[59:11] according to that you can go back to
[59:13] god's questions and answers on genesis
[59:16] the tapes that the prophet put out on
[59:17] that and listen to that and you'll hear
[59:19] it all
[59:20] over and over and over as it comes forth
[59:23] into a manifestation of understanding
[59:27] that god before the world knew
[59:34] ever move ever thought every idea that
[59:37] you and i
[59:38] would ever have
[59:41] and he knew what he was going to do he
[59:44] knew he was going to bring adam and eve
[59:46] into the garden
[59:47] in a physical being one day
[59:53] and that they would sin
[59:58] and he would have to do other things but
[1:00:01] he never
[1:00:02] killed him this is what i love
[1:00:07] he said he never even cursed adam or eve
[1:00:11] the one he cursed the serpent
[1:00:15] the land the things but he never cursed
[1:00:19] adam
[1:00:19] now that's understandable because adam's
[1:00:22] the son of god
[1:00:23] but he never cursed eve
[1:00:26] see why because eve brother branham said
[1:00:29] was in
[1:00:30] god in theophany
[1:00:35] so if if adam's soul was eternal
[1:00:39] it was in adam's theophany if adam's
[1:00:42] soul
[1:00:43] was eternal then the soul of eve would
[1:00:46] have to be eternal
[1:00:54] then the plan of redemption would enter
[1:00:56] the picture
[1:01:01] sure that he would have to go on and
[1:01:03] create and bring into bodies and things
[1:01:05] like that yes
[1:01:09] but think about back before the world
[1:01:12] that he knew
[1:01:12] all of that was going to take place
[1:01:13] before it ever even took place forever
[1:01:16] even thought
[1:01:16] started god by his own foreknowledge
[1:01:20] he did predest tonight
[1:01:27] in other words he had the plan and
[1:01:30] purpose before the world ever
[1:01:32] was thought of the plan and purpose of
[1:01:36] almighty god was brought into view even
[1:01:38] before the world was ever thought of
[1:01:40] you agree with me see what a wonderful
[1:01:43] thing to think about
[1:01:46] that would put us into the spiritual
[1:01:48] being form
[1:01:51] and then the spiritual being of form
[1:01:52] stage one is right in the basis
[1:01:55] that it's before the world ever begun
[1:01:58] that it would all come into
[1:02:04] manifestation
[1:02:06] and if he was ever there you'll be there
[1:02:09] if you weren't there you never will be
[1:02:10] there
[1:02:12] nor what who the spirit man
[1:02:16] the one that he said let us make man
[1:02:20] in our own image and what kind of a man
[1:02:22] did he make the prophet said
[1:02:24] said he made a spirit man
[1:02:33] well now if he made a spirit man
[1:02:41] you know for certain that he knew he was
[1:02:43] going to fall
[1:02:47] he had to allow mankind to come
[1:02:50] we'll get to that on the next stage but
[1:02:53] he knew
[1:02:56] what he was going to do
[1:02:59] he didn't create a son
[1:03:05] when you talk about the son of god you
[1:03:07] talk about the word the logos the things
[1:03:09] the theophanies and the things he didn't
[1:03:11] create a son
[1:03:13] he was that son just brought into
[1:03:17] manifestation
[1:03:18] why because jesus went over no man has
[1:03:21] seen the father
[1:03:24] but the son has to clarity right
[1:03:31] the son that declared him
[1:03:35] in other words he brought him out in the
[1:03:36] open that we can understand him
[1:03:39] because we couldn't understand him in
[1:03:40] spirit being
[1:03:44] but when it comes to the point of
[1:03:48] of knowing that there was more to the
[1:03:50] story
[1:03:53] he would make a way
[1:03:58] he would make a way to where that he
[1:04:02] could bring man into being
[1:04:04] sure see then adam came into being as a
[1:04:09] spirit man first right
[1:04:12] that's right you come in as a spirit man
[1:04:15] first
[1:04:16] with eternal life
[1:04:19] he said wait a minute no no come on
[1:04:21] you're not getting it right
[1:04:23] you're not listening to the story you're
[1:04:24] trying to free run me
[1:04:26] and just figuring it out don't do that
[1:04:28] just back up and walk with us a little
[1:04:30] bit
[1:04:33] because you see he had to make a man
[1:04:37] before there could be a fall
[1:04:41] right and he had to make him
[1:04:44] not eternal if he made him
[1:04:48] remember that anything you get that god
[1:04:52] makes with our word make our word
[1:04:55] new our word thoughts anything you get
[1:04:58] that makes
[1:04:59] god to want to the point that he's
[1:05:05] having problems under you know to
[1:05:08] bring into the open his plan and purpose
[1:05:14] see then you you're trying to figure him
[1:05:17] out
[1:05:19] don't try to figure him out just accept
[1:05:20] what he says
[1:05:24] hey come on folks maybe you've never
[1:05:26] done it but i will remember
[1:05:28] i can stand here today and remember back
[1:05:30] in those old baptist days sitting there
[1:05:32] in them pews
[1:05:35] now some of them preachers could preach
[1:05:39] you know pretty good
[1:05:44] and they could preach enough till i i
[1:05:46] caught on to a few things
[1:05:51] and me and my brother we'd get into the
[1:05:54] discussion because he was a theologian
[1:05:56] he got about 12 years of college we get
[1:05:59] into discussion
[1:06:05] and he's shrewd i'm talking about not
[1:06:07] just he's shrewd
[1:06:11] he's still smart as attack
[1:06:17] yet i told him one day i said from now
[1:06:18] on we're going to talk about the word
[1:06:21] we ain't going to talk about your ideas
[1:06:23] or your opinions or your thoughts remind
[1:06:25] either one
[1:06:26] you quote a scripture i'll quote a
[1:06:28] scripture because if you don't we're
[1:06:29] going to quit talking
[1:06:30] we quit talking
[1:06:35] why because he was natural
[1:06:38] how could you ever try to explain to him
[1:06:40] that adam
[1:06:44] was god's first creation
[1:06:48] he'd go right to the garden put him
[1:06:50] standing there you can't do that
[1:06:53] you got to put adam in glory
[1:06:58] because that's where he was at jesus was
[1:07:02] there and said remember the glory that
[1:07:03] we had
[1:07:06] see one of these days we're going to
[1:07:08] find out that there's a lot to do and
[1:07:11] more than we think but just remember
[1:07:18] jesus was not created of god
[1:07:24] to where that god could come into being
[1:07:29] he wasn't created he was that god
[1:07:33] he just moved from one form to another
[1:07:38] that's all that i've ever tried to
[1:07:39] explain of the godhead that you just
[1:07:42] take
[1:07:42] all that god was
[1:07:46] pour it into christ now take all the
[1:07:50] christ and pour him into the church
[1:07:55] then you'll find out what the new
[1:07:56] creation is
[1:08:00] then you'll find out where the prophet
[1:08:01] when he gets over there and he said this
[1:08:03] is a special designation of himself
[1:08:05] said this is talking about his church he
[1:08:08] gets all the way over and this
[1:08:11] tells us how beautiful the bride of
[1:08:12] jesus christ is
[1:08:14] listen just for a minute
[1:08:18] do you understand then stage one
[1:08:23] the beginning of the creation of god so
[1:08:26] you read it in revelations it's the
[1:08:28] message to this age
[1:08:30] so then the message to this age would be
[1:08:32] that message of the beginning of the
[1:08:34] creation of god
[1:08:35] or in other words the capability would
[1:08:38] be in this age
[1:08:39] to comprehend how god could come into
[1:08:42] being
[1:08:43] and manifest himself and not change his
[1:08:45] form
[1:08:46] or to be a son over here and a father
[1:08:48] here no
[1:08:51] he was just all of that put together in
[1:08:54] one thing
[1:08:56] there's just one person
[1:09:00] there's just one god
[1:09:04] yeah but i i don't understand because
[1:09:06] jesus looked like he was god
[1:09:08] jesus was the man that god dwelt in
[1:09:11] the flesh man there's a flesh man
[1:09:14] involved in this
[1:09:18] that god would come down in human flesh
[1:09:22] and that's why it says it in him was the
[1:09:25] word
[1:09:28] and the word was with god and the word
[1:09:31] was
[1:09:32] god
[1:09:39] think on it god is not a creation
[1:09:44] there's not somebody creating the other
[1:09:46] one it's stepping in
[1:09:47] see the pride is when we get to that
[1:09:49] we're going to really hold it right
[1:09:51] because when you get to the bride see
[1:09:52] you're going to find out all god was
[1:09:55] he poured into christ all christ into
[1:09:58] the church
[1:10:02] take her back to the garden of eden
[1:10:05] i'm going to find out that a part of you
[1:10:10] brother duret
[1:10:13] a part of you
[1:10:17] was back there before the world
[1:10:25] but the prophet said if not then it
[1:10:27] never will be
[1:10:32] but it wasn't back there like we want to
[1:10:34] think like peoples and
[1:10:36] ideas and principles and things right
[1:10:44] there wasn't but one man
[1:10:48] let's see if we can get this right and
[1:10:50] then we'll quit
[1:10:52] but just remember what i tried to bring
[1:10:54] about to you
[1:10:58] when you're talking about creating see
[1:11:01] we think about
[1:11:02] a wood tree growed
[1:11:05] made wood made of tree we cut that down
[1:11:08] we made
[1:11:08] done it made paper uh we made all kinds
[1:11:11] of things out of this tree that used to
[1:11:13] be in the ground
[1:11:16] but see god made it all by his word
[1:11:24] the only time that they were allowed to
[1:11:26] show of
[1:11:28] scene at the passion play because we
[1:11:31] found out later it was copyrighted
[1:11:33] and they only were allowed to use it one
[1:11:35] time
[1:11:36] and in that many of you have been to the
[1:11:39] passion
[1:11:40] plays and the things and know what i'm
[1:11:42] talking about
[1:11:43] that they act out the parts they act out
[1:11:45] to play they do the things you know
[1:11:47] and and all like that and then this one
[1:11:51] thing they would always make some form
[1:11:53] of a cloud floating around and bloom
[1:11:56] bloom and a world coming into being
[1:11:59] known if one
[1:12:01] this scene just opened up understood a
[1:12:06] man
[1:12:08] i thought it's a little different what
[1:12:11] they've been doing
[1:12:12] they're stood a man
[1:12:16] he stood there for a little bit and all
[1:12:18] at once he said
[1:12:19] let there be
[1:12:23] the world started coming into being you
[1:12:25] know now that how they act out the parts
[1:12:27] and the things they've done
[1:12:29] the sound and the smoke and the things
[1:12:31] and and all and he'd say let there be
[1:12:33] let there be and all at once it stopped
[1:12:38] and he stopped and he stood still
[1:12:42] i'm talking about a man in full dress
[1:12:44] everything you know what i'm saying
[1:12:47] and he said i mean it didn't say
[1:12:49] anything
[1:12:50] but all at once something happened
[1:12:53] and it just like he you know how they
[1:12:55] could they'd wound up making the rocks
[1:12:57] where they'd
[1:12:58] fold over each other and do the things
[1:13:00] you know where they could do
[1:13:01] and he just stepped through them rocks
[1:13:04] out of the way it closed back behind him
[1:13:08] and a baby cried
[1:13:13] a baby cried
[1:13:17] they started that play
[1:13:20] with jesus christ as a baby the only
[1:13:23] time that i ever seen him do it
[1:13:25] they'd start him as a man or this that
[1:13:27] the other they started him as a baby
[1:13:31] i sat there and cried because that was
[1:13:34] what
[1:13:35] happened the same one that created the
[1:13:39] world
[1:13:40] the same one who created all things
[1:13:43] one day stepped down into human flesh
[1:13:48] as a child grew as a child but i love
[1:13:52] the prophet the way he says things
[1:13:54] he said you're god with no teeth
[1:14:00] you think that little baby laying up
[1:14:01] there in that manger
[1:14:06] was the very god that had said let there
[1:14:12] be i thought well
[1:14:15] we did we checked into it we found out
[1:14:17] that they said it was copyrighted they
[1:14:19] couldn't view it no more
[1:14:20] like that because of the way they had it
[1:14:22] copyrighted
[1:14:24] and i thought ever who taught that they
[1:14:27] were they
[1:14:28] knew what they were talking about
[1:14:30] because you go from the very man that
[1:14:32] was the creator of all things
[1:14:34] almighty god the next step was a baby
[1:14:38] laying in a manger let's stand together
