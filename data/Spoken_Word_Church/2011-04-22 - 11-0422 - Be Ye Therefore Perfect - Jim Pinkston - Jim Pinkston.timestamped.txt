[21:46] dismissed so I'll just take this time to
[21:47] greet you the name of the Lord uh no
[21:50] stranger to the South I am a southerner
[21:52] that's the first time I've been in Lula
[21:53] Georgia I didn't even know Lula Georgia
[21:56] and and Dale's Ville and Hillsville and
[22:00] all the vills I didn't know about that
[22:02] I'm not very good very good
[22:04] geographically uh but I have lived uh in
[22:08] uh Georgia uh up
[22:10] coming uh years ago actually in Florida
[22:14] Pastor Jacksonville for 16 years and of
[22:16] course now we're out in the midwest but
[22:18] I feel home I'm I'm in the South and
[22:20] that's not what makes me feel home but
[22:22] it's the kindred spirit of your pastor
[22:24] and brother Wade and uh uh your pastor
[22:28] was with us just not long ago
[22:29] ministering and really enjoyed that am
[22:31] and brother way has ministered for us
[22:33] several times we appreciate you letting
[22:35] him get away uh now he says he's getting
[22:38] away just to hunt deer and Bambi and
[22:39] whatnot but he comes by to preach to
[22:41] bless the saints of God and uh it's been
[22:44] a great blessing for us so we do
[22:45] appreciate that and uh uh we trust that
[22:49] we can return the uh return so I
[22:53] appreciate uh the confidence that uh
[22:55] your pastor would have in me to invite
[22:56] me uh to to his pull pit I know as a
[22:59] pastor we don't have revolving doors we
[23:01] want to be really selective in what
[23:03] we're hearing and what we're looking at
[23:05] and what's being preached and so forth
[23:06] because we're just living in a very
[23:07] treacherous hour very deceiving time so
[23:10] we want to be sure to examine everything
[23:11] right by by the words so want to just
[23:14] get into the word this evening I'm going
[23:15] to have you if you will while you're
[23:16] standing to turn uh to Genesis 17 and
[23:20] verse
[23:21] 1 Genesis 17 and verse in verse
[23:26] one and and uh of course this portion of
[23:30] scripture uh is going to deal with
[23:33] Abraham or God's dealing with
[23:35] Abraham and uh I began to uh I started
[23:39] oh I think it's been maybe a year ago
[23:41] just on a series on the life of Abraham
[23:43] uh considering how brother bams that was
[23:45] a type of the elect type of the church
[23:46] in the end time and so forth and Paul
[23:49] had written in uh Romans 4:12 he said we
[23:51] are to walk in the faith of the
[23:53] footsteps of Our Father Abraham and
[23:55] being the Royal Seed of Abraham so
[23:56] there's going to be a lot of a lot of
[23:58] parallels and similarities and so forth
[24:00] and what we can actually find in the
[24:02] life of Abraham we'll actually uh see
[24:04] much the same in our own life brother B
[24:06] said that is as the seat of God will go
[24:09] and so I want to take one verse of
[24:11] scripture and read it Genesis 17
[24:14] And1 and when Abraham was 90 years old
[24:17] and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and
[24:20] said unto him I am the allmighty god
[24:22] walk before me and be thou perfect walk
[24:26] before me and be thou perfect can we
[24:28] just bow our heads just for a moment a
[24:31] word of prayer Heavenly Father we are
[24:32] thankful
[24:34] for uh this opportunity we have to
[24:37] address the saints of God the bride of
[24:38] Christ the Lamb's wife it's always a joy
[24:41] Lord as well as a privilege to minister
[24:44] these things that you put upon our heart
[24:46] that you've uh privileged US to
[24:48] understand in this hour and so I pray
[24:51] that you'd help us
[24:52] Lord uh as we commit our time to you
[24:56] father May our hearts be open as the
[24:58] eyes of our heart as we have sung Lord
[25:00] and may you speak to us may the Holy
[25:02] Spirit just uh deal with us individually
[25:05] and collectively Lord and may we say the
[25:07] things that would be pleasing to you and
[25:09] that would be helpful father may we may
[25:11] we stand like the sons of isachar who
[25:13] had an understanding of the times knew
[25:15] what Israel was to do or the bride and
[25:17] desire must be uh must be prepared
[25:20] that's right uh with the word in this
[25:22] hour father because we want to know what
[25:26] we are to do and what's taking place
[25:29] what's going on as the prophet of God St
[25:30] so we want to stay in the word watch uh
[25:33] watch the the things unfold has been
[25:35] prophesied and so father may we just now
[25:38] experience your nearness Your Love move
[25:41] us forward in the faith tonight dear God
[25:42] we'll ask it in the lovely name of the
[25:44] Lord Jesus Christ and all of God's
[25:46] people said amen amen God bless you you
[25:49] may be
[25:49] seated uh if you
[25:52] will it's hard the challenge of a
[25:55] Preacher as myself and I don't know if
[25:57] brother
[25:58] uh how he ministers and series and
[26:01] things like that but I know that that I
[26:02] have for a number of years right and
[26:04] it's uh it's always easy to uh to turn
[26:09] down invitations to get out and preach
[26:10] because of the effort it takes I think
[26:13] to put everything together uh when
[26:16] you're at your home Church you have the
[26:17] luxury of going 40 Services 50 services
[26:20] but such is not the
[26:22] case when you go out so uh it takes a
[26:26] lot of time and I invited I think maybe
[26:29] last year and I just no I'll just leave
[26:31] that to the Evangelist but uh uh the
[26:34] last time uh brother Wade brother Samuel
[26:36] came they said that we're not leaving
[26:38] till you give us a date so they did
[26:40] leave and that was because I gave them a
[26:42] date so this is the day that it worked
[26:44] out uh so I thought well we just take
[26:47] something uh and I probably changed um I
[26:51] probably changed my mind several times
[26:53] on what to what to minister you know it
[26:56] it it's not a lack it's just just
[26:57] there's just an abundance of things they
[26:59] say well so which direction do we go and
[27:02] so uh as a matter of fact I've prepared
[27:04] all week and things like that and just
[27:06] something didn't feel right and I got up
[27:08] this morning about 7:00 we had to be at
[27:10] the airport about 10:00 so I got up and
[27:12] I so once again tried to condense a 40
[27:16] sermon series uh to present so so I I I
[27:20] trust the Lord will help us am uh
[27:22] tonight and I will say this uh that uh
[27:26] that if if I say something that's
[27:29] contrary to what's taught here in the
[27:30] Tabernacle brother Dale he's your pastor
[27:32] he's ordained to lead you through you
[27:34] just chalk it up to my ignorance and
[27:36] just say bless him Lord and uh like
[27:38] brother Ram said he said just uh uh just
[27:41] spit out the seat he to fin just spit
[27:43] out the seed so uh we're just in that
[27:45] hour where it's just very critical it's
[27:47] very crucial and uh so uh and I believe
[27:50] eventually the ministry will be on the
[27:52] same page the lady will be on the same
[27:53] page I believe it's Isaiah 58 and 53
[27:56] and8 right in there there that says uh
[28:00] uh it said when the Lord would redeem
[28:02] Zion would restore Zion uh and the voice
[28:05] would be lifted up the Watchman on the
[28:07] wall would lift the voice up and uh they
[28:10] would see eye to eye and sing the same
[28:11] song when we hear ear to ear I believe
[28:14] we'll begin to see eye to ey and so
[28:16] there has been a voice that has declared
[28:18] a word in this hour and that's all that
[28:19] we that's all we have to live for and
[28:21] it's all we have to preach so we trust
[28:24] it'll be a blessing today so it was it
[28:26] was these words that I had read when we
[28:28] got down this far in our series walk
[28:31] before me and be thou perfect amen and
[28:34] then of course it reminded me that we as
[28:36] the children of Abraham we've been given
[28:38] the same commission basically as Abraham
[28:40] right who is the father of our faith
[28:42] right and uh and it was these words walk
[28:45] before me and be thou perfect uh the
[28:49] sermon title tonight will be this be ye
[28:51] there for be therefore perfect let me
[28:54] let me read just a statement here in the
[28:56] message law have having a shadow in bams
[28:59] in New York brother bam made this a
[29:01] statement he said Perfection he said God
[29:03] requires Perfection right no one could
[29:06] ever come to Heaven outside of being
[29:08] perfect you must be perfect and the
[29:10] scripture says None is perfect so if you
[29:12] must be perfect to come to heaven then
[29:15] and the scripture says None is perfect
[29:17] and we've all sent and come short of the
[29:18] glory of God how are we ever going to
[29:19] enter God's living place and Dwelling
[29:21] Place when he requires Perfection Jesus
[29:24] said I Believe In The Sermon on the
[29:25] Mount he said be therefore perfect even
[29:28] as your father in Heaven is perfect it
[29:30] goes on to say go goes on to say think
[29:33] of the Perfection that God requires of
[29:35] the person person a Perfection right
[29:37] right so it says stop take a look at it
[29:39] take account of it think of the
[29:41] Perfection now that God requires because
[29:43] there's going to be a lot of
[29:44] misunderstanding of perfection and
[29:46] there's going to be all different levels
[29:48] of perfection different ways of
[29:49] perfection and uh so we're just going to
[29:52] look at actually one of one of those
[29:53] ways uh and I'll explain more here as we
[29:56] get on here in just a little bit things
[29:57] that are to be in reality of California
[29:59] brother man said he's gone to prepare
[30:00] Place prepare place he at a perfect
[30:02] place right where no evil exists no
[30:04] sickness no old age exist no death
[30:06] exists it's a perfect place calling you
[30:08] to that Perfection and you have to be
[30:11] perfect to get there amen Jesus said so
[30:13] Bible say so Jesus said be therefore
[30:15] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[30:17] perfect and it's a perfect Kingdom so it
[30:20] must be a perfect people come because
[30:21] you have to stand to be married to a
[30:23] perfect Son of God and you must be a
[30:25] perfect bride so we get from these
[30:27] and many more that God's requiring
[30:29] Perfection some sort of perfection
[30:31] whatever we would associate his
[30:33] Perfection or how we apply Perfection
[30:35] God would call it Perfection is that
[30:36] right that's right so it's from
[30:38] statements like this and and many others
[30:40] acts I begin to study the subject out
[30:42] and uh begin to present them from the
[30:45] pull pit uh just what it was as I was
[30:48] looking at it in the way of perfection
[30:49] that God requires of us as he did
[30:51] Abraham now twice in the two statements
[30:54] that I've just read brother Brandon
[30:56] refers back to the the New Testament
[30:57] scripture Jesus action that was in the
[30:59] sermon of the mount that's right in
[31:01] Matthew
[31:02] 5:48 uh when he said be you therefore
[31:04] perfect uh even as your father which is
[31:06] in heaven is perfect
[31:08] now there is a clue I believe in this
[31:11] scripture right that's revealed that
[31:14] lets us know that he's actually speaking
[31:16] to us here the elect in the end time
[31:19] because of a word that he uses here and
[31:21] the word for perfect there is teos and
[31:25] it literally means to be full grown it
[31:28] means to be adult it means to be a full
[31:31] age it means to be mature so be you
[31:34] therefore perfect no we're not so we're
[31:36] we're we're we're ruling out of
[31:38] perfection in the flesh cuz brother call
[31:40] it a carnal nature he said it'll always
[31:42] be sticky and whatnot so we're not
[31:44] talking about a perfection in the flesh
[31:46] all right so looking at the word that
[31:49] Jesus uses Tios which is which is which
[31:52] is an end time type word and it's used a
[31:55] number of times in the New Testament
[31:57] and this Perfection is basically just
[31:59] means maturity or full grown it's used
[32:03] again in Hebrews 5 and: 14 where the
[32:06] Apostle Paul said but strong meat
[32:09] belongs to them that are of full age
[32:11] right now back up to the previous verse
[32:13] he says verse 13 He that uses milk is
[32:16] unskillful in in the word of
[32:18] righteousness for he is a babe right
[32:20] well a babe drinks milk natur spiritual
[32:21] drinks milk but strong meat belongs to
[32:24] them that are perfect see so there there
[32:26] things now we can associate once we see
[32:28] this is the hour where in Perfection is
[32:30] required we'll see things that begin to
[32:33] connect together with it right so strong
[32:35] meat then belongs to let's say it like
[32:38] this us which are perfect are coming to
[32:41] this Perfection amen even those by who
[32:43] by reason of use have their senses
[32:45] exercised to discern both good and evil
[32:50] now the Apostle Paul you may remember in
[32:51] 1 Corinthians in Chapter 13 He talks uh
[32:55] which of course is the love chapter he
[32:57] continues on and he says we know in part
[33:00] we prophesy in part but when that which
[33:02] is perfect comes that which is part will
[33:03] be done away with no page 10:5 of the
[33:06] CLD Book 2 brother said we do have today
[33:08] with Divine Vindication that which is
[33:10] perfect has come all right so Paul goes
[33:12] on to say when I was a child I spake as
[33:15] a child I understood as a child I
[33:16] thought as a child but when I became a
[33:18] man I put away childish things and so
[33:21] Paul is actually taking the maturity of
[33:24] the church from its birth to its body
[33:26] change
[33:27] uh in paralleling it with his own self
[33:30] so when I was a child what does a child
[33:31] do he speaks like a child he thinks like
[33:33] a child he understands like a child
[33:35] right he's a baby he drinks milk and so
[33:37] forth and it said but now when we get to
[33:40] this place we're in Perfection you don't
[33:41] require Perfection of a baby do you you
[33:44] can't he's a human he's born but we
[33:46] realize there's a process a maturing
[33:49] process from childhood to adulthood are
[33:52] you with me all right so he says when I
[33:54] became a man then I put away childish s
[33:57] now right he goes on to say now we see
[34:00] through glass Darkly now but then face
[34:02] to face then when that which is perfect
[34:04] comes we see face to face we know it
[34:05] part and so forth but then I shall know
[34:09] even as I am also known so so he's
[34:14] prophesying a time then that the church
[34:17] will come to its birth to its mature
[34:19] position I like the statement in things
[34:21] that are to be brother mam said now you
[34:23] grew from your birth right when you was
[34:26] born and presented into this world God
[34:27] knew that you were going to be here in
[34:29] this earth and you grow it from birth to
[34:31] maturity talking about a natural man
[34:33] things that seem so strange to you in
[34:35] your young Womanhood young Boyhood as
[34:37] children now seems very real you
[34:39] couldn't understand it when you was a
[34:40] child but now as you become an adult you
[34:43] begin to understand and find out that
[34:45] everything was set just right he said it
[34:48] really means something to you now he
[34:49] says now so is it in your spiritual
[34:51] birth I'm not going to take time
[34:53] actually to begin to parallel these
[34:55] because I think that uh you certainly
[34:57] understand maybe the direction that I'm
[34:59] going amen there is a statement on page
[35:00] 363 I'd like to read in the church age
[35:02] book where brother mam said he talks
[35:04] about the false Vine group coming to
[35:06] fruition and he says that her fruit
[35:08] would mature and ripen he said that's
[35:10] correct he said but also now he said if
[35:14] the true uh if the false will mature he
[35:17] said then it must also be that the true
[35:19] bride church WIll mature all right
[35:22] that's right so this is what God's
[35:23] looking at he's not looking at babies in
[35:25] Christ he's looking for a mature
[35:27] uh full grown church is that right and
[35:30] he said her
[35:32] ripness her ripeness what are we laying
[35:34] in the presence of the son to do to
[35:35] ripen us right her ripness shall be an
[35:38] identification with her Lord by means of
[35:40] the word now words her maturity then
[35:43] will be an identification that God sees
[35:46] that God looks at uh as as an
[35:51] identification by means of the word in
[35:53] her head who will come to her M Gods
[35:54] which deed is Christ now what quickly
[35:57] becomes apparent to us is that in this
[36:00] verse and in the preceding verses which
[36:02] I'll get to here in just in just a
[36:05] bit is that we have instructions here
[36:07] Jesus gives us instructions to those who
[36:11] are placed adoption manifested son we're
[36:14] talking about placing Amen in other
[36:15] words you've come to your election and
[36:17] now Jesus requires us to be perfect amen
[36:20] this becomes a requirement right now
[36:22] when you consider the the the
[36:25] location of verse 48 the timing of this
[36:29] verse and the placement of this verse in
[36:31] its context with the previous 10 verses
[36:34] could perhaps jop that down and read it
[36:36] later and I'll read some of them in just
[36:38] a minute but it gives us I think a very
[36:41] different mindset or at least a
[36:42] different appreciation of what Jesus is
[36:44] referring to as Perfection but
[36:47] nevertheless that is the bottom line
[36:49] It's the final position for the bride be
[36:52] you therefore perfect is that right now
[36:54] I want you to understand here that Jesus
[36:55] is not necessarily talking about your
[36:58] doctrinal understanding here right he's
[37:00] not speaking about being under the blood
[37:02] and being identified with your sacrifice
[37:04] and being perfected in him which of
[37:05] course is true absolutely but that's not
[37:08] what he's talking about here he's
[37:09] talking about our Tios literally our
[37:13] human integrity and virtue that's
[37:16] present in full grown mature people
[37:19] exactly so he's talking about a
[37:20] character if you will he's talking about
[37:22] an attitude he's talking about a mature
[37:25] condition of my spirit that's right now
[37:28] I want to go to Hebrews 12 and read
[37:29] Paul's words concerning the Journey of
[37:32] the church in verse 22 he says but you
[37:35] now talking about the church are come to
[37:37] Mount Zion right and the City of the
[37:40] Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and
[37:42] unto an enumerable company of angels
[37:44] Amen to the general assembly and the
[37:47] Church of the firstborn which are
[37:48] written in heaven that's right and to
[37:50] God the judge of all I mean know he's
[37:53] coming is out God theud and to the
[37:55] spirits now watch the last thing he says
[37:57] and to the spirits of just men made
[37:59] perfect amen see to the spirits of just
[38:02] men made perfect now how many remembers
[38:04] in The Invisible Union of the Bride not
[38:06] only there but it works his faith
[38:07] Express in many of those sermons that he
[38:09] preached in that last little swing
[38:11] through the West Coast there but he
[38:13] begins to talk about true justification
[38:15] and explains it to us and he invest
[38:17] quite a bit of time in that talking
[38:19] about true justification
[38:22] right uh I'm reminded of a scripture in
[38:24] 1 Timothy 3:16 that says with
[38:27] controversy great is the mystery of godl
[38:29] God was manifest In the Flesh now watch
[38:31] justified in the spirit see of angels
[38:35] God was manifest In the Flesh now watch
[38:37] justified in the spirit so we're talking
[38:39] about a justification now in the spirit
[38:41] SST see of angels preach of the Gentiles
[38:43] believed on in the world received up
[38:45] into into Glory uh it was in Romans 8:
[38:50] 28-34 uh in Ephesians 1 1-5 he said all
[38:53] that he forew he did call and he called
[38:55] he justified all
[38:57] and all that he justified he's already
[38:58] glorified right brother actually quotes
[39:01] that it works as Faith expressed
[39:03] now the spirits of just men men that are
[39:06] Justified the spirits of these men made
[39:09] perfect now we're talking about AOS or
[39:11] be you therefore perfect even as your
[39:13] father which is Spirit In Heaven is
[39:15] perfect so there's the connection now
[39:18] that's right I want to get ahead of
[39:19] myself let me read to you the five
[39:20] verses that precede verse
[39:22] 48 Jesus says in verse 43 Matthew chap 5
[39:25] you have heard word that it's been said
[39:28] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[39:29] thine enemy but I say unto you love your
[39:32] enemies bless them that curse you do
[39:33] give them that hate you pray for them
[39:36] which despitefully use you and persecute
[39:38] you am that you may be the children of
[39:40] your father which is in heaven for he
[39:43] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[39:45] the good sendeth rain on the just and
[39:48] the unjust so both groups now here get
[39:50] the benefit of the blessings of the
[39:52] message but there is an identifiable
[39:55] difference though
[39:57] or if you love them which love you what
[39:59] reward have you do not in the publicans
[40:01] the same if you salute your brethren
[40:03] only what more do you have than others
[40:06] do not the publicans also then be you
[40:08] therefore perfect so we have
[40:10] instructions
[40:11] here and these instructions in Matthew
[40:13] Chapter 5 are basic to understand how
[40:18] the spirit of a man the spirit of a
[40:20] woman who has been totally justified in
[40:22] the presence of God is in fact made
[40:25] perfect Glory say made perfect so it
[40:28] implies a process right right implies a
[40:30] process so what Jesus is presenting to
[40:32] us here is a word a behavior a conduct
[40:38] if you will a guideline amen that will
[40:41] serve as a gauge of the Perfection now
[40:44] that he requires of his people and it's
[40:47] going to be revealed by my response to
[40:50] and my treatment of my enemies and of
[40:52] those that persecute me and those that
[40:54] despitefully use me and they that hate
[40:56] me and they that curse me y right be
[41:00] therefore perfect even as your father or
[41:02] or literally in this respect right in
[41:05] this manner so Perfection now in this
[41:08] context he's dealing with a spirit now
[41:10] watch amen John 4:24 Jesus said God is a
[41:14] spirit so we then now he's talking about
[41:18] perfection in spirit even as our father
[41:20] who is spirit is perfect amen so he's
[41:23] telling me then Perfection will never be
[41:25] possible
[41:26] without the indwelling God who is Spirit
[41:30] otherwise all you have is a trained and
[41:32] refined human spirit and you'll be
[41:34] nothing but what brother called a mimic
[41:36] of
[41:37] Christianity in the Raptor he said
[41:39] there'll be millions and billions of
[41:41] them that will just be mimics of
[41:44] Christianity amen that's why David said
[41:46] in Psalm 51:10 he said create in me a
[41:49] clean heart oh God and renew a right
[41:53] Spirit within me so God can and in fact
[41:57] does not only create a clean heart but
[42:00] can renew and will renew a right spirit
[42:02] in me because that's dealing with this
[42:04] end time Perfection that it requires us
[42:07] that's right renew simply means repair
[42:09] or make a new right a right spirit is a
[42:12] restored spirit and establish a fixed a
[42:15] prepared so Jesus I believe is
[42:18] instructing us with regard to our spirit
[42:21] our attitude our Behavior if you will
[42:24] because we know that we in a placing
[42:27] process all right going from our true
[42:30] baptism to that mature
[42:34] position which is Hebrews
[42:37] 6:1 therefore leaving the principles is
[42:41] that what he said of the doctrine of
[42:43] Christ let us go on to Perfection okay
[42:47] of the doctrines of baptisms laying on
[42:49] of hands into the Resurrection the dead
[42:50] and eternal judgment and this will do if
[42:53] God permit but God didn't permit it
[42:55] there in that hour exactly so he says
[42:58] now but here's where we've got to leave
[43:00] something to go into something else the
[43:02] rudiments the fundamentals the
[43:04] foundational truths let nothing's wrong
[43:06] with the doctrine of baptisms and of
[43:08] Judgment of the dead and of faith in God
[43:10] and repentance from dead Works those
[43:12] things you want but once you preached
[43:13] once you come that way you don't want to
[43:15] hear a sermon on water baptism every
[43:17] Sund you got the baptism of Holy Ghost
[43:19] you don't want to hear a sermon service
[43:20] after service on the baptism of the Holy
[43:22] Ghost so you move from that the first
[43:25] principal of Christ and he said let's go
[43:27] into Perfection now this is an
[43:29] interesting word that the Apostle Paul
[43:31] uses uh and it's the only time that it's
[43:33] used in the New Testament and the word
[43:35] there the the better interpretation
[43:37] would be the perfector let us go on to
[43:40] the
[43:41] perfector and by definition it means the
[43:44] finisher so we're leaving the author of
[43:46] our faith and now going to the finisher
[43:47] of our faith see when you build a
[43:49] building you pour the foundation you put
[43:51] the walls up you dry it in and you don't
[43:53] come back and pour the foundation again
[43:54] and put the walls up you need a finish
[43:56] Carpenter to come in you need a turnkey
[43:58] crew to come in see you guys got a
[44:01] little little uh a little um uh you
[44:04] maybe you just have to do maybe just
[44:06] some touchup with the paintbrush or the
[44:07] or the sanding block or or uh you know
[44:10] with the hammer or whatever it's a
[44:11] finishing work now it's not an overhaul
[44:14] at this point and now it's just a
[44:15] finishing just a refinement if you will
[44:18] so he said leave the first principles
[44:20] and let's move on toward the perfector
[44:22] now and this what Paul was dealing with
[44:24] going from this to that to this to that
[44:26] all to the
[44:27] perfector which means the finisher or
[44:30] according to the D lot one who has in
[44:33] his own person raised Faith to its
[44:37] Perfection that would be perfect thing
[44:40] and so set before us the highest example
[44:42] of Faith now Paul perhaps would be
[44:45] talking about the Lord Jesus Christ have
[44:46] no problem with that but I believe that
[44:48] we've had one a forerunner that God has
[44:51] set in our midst to show us the highest
[44:54] example of faith come on a prophet of
[44:57] God so we're told now to go to this
[45:00] perfector
[45:01] now so the process here is this you come
[45:06] to the perfector and he'll raise your
[45:09] faith to its maturity right to its
[45:12] completion to his Perfection brother I'm
[45:14] talk about perfect Faith perfect faith
[45:16] and what is Faith he said he said faith
[45:18] is a revelation of the hour of the day
[45:19] the hour of the message and so forth so
[45:21] we come to the place of a perfect
[45:23] Revelation a perfect understanding all
[45:25] right that's what's here for us as I've
[45:27] often said if we've got the perfect
[45:29] interpretation of the word and that's
[45:31] come right then why wouldn't there be
[45:33] somebody here that could claim a perfect
[45:36] understanding of the perfect word next
[45:38] time now maybe we're not there now but I
[45:41] believe it would be in our you know our
[45:43] our near future that somebody's going to
[45:46] have an understanding of that per
[45:47] interpretation all right now so so the
[45:52] perfector will raise our faith to its
[45:54] maturity which will certainly expressed
[45:56] himself at least in part in the making
[46:00] perfect of the Justified believer Spirit
[46:03] right so there's something that begins
[46:05] to transpire in us from the baptism of
[46:09] the Holy Ghost like a baby forming in
[46:11] its mother's wound there's a growth
[46:13] right and as a and as a result of that
[46:16] growth I believe Jesus is telling us
[46:19] that there must be an identifiable
[46:22] Spirit or an attitude that will Express
[46:24] itself through you right and without
[46:27] question I believe that we should be
[46:29] able to
[46:31] identify this perfected spirit in our
[46:34] own lives and in the lives of others so
[46:37] what I'm saying is that at this time
[46:40] that Perfection is required of the Bride
[46:43] there should be an attitude or a spirit
[46:46] that our Revelation has created in us
[46:48] right that expresses itself right I'm
[46:52] saying to you tonight that our
[46:54] Revelation at this time we'll have
[46:58] created in us what Jesus is looking for
[47:02] because this is the identifiable result
[47:06] that we're looking for now in ourselves
[47:07] and others elect I'm talking about
[47:10] because it's what's God's looking for in
[47:12] US listen to the statement in stats of a
[47:14] perfect man on page 12 brother ra said
[47:17] what is it God condescending to his
[47:20] creation God wants to be worshiped the
[47:23] word god means I become worship now
[47:25] watch it's God trying to condition his
[47:28] people so he can get from them what he
[47:31] created them for he created us he
[47:34] created us to worship he created us for
[47:35] Fellowship he created us for communion
[47:38] amen he created us for dialogue he
[47:41] created us to express his own life his
[47:42] own character his own nature is that
[47:44] right he created us for these things he
[47:46] said God's trying to get from us tonight
[47:49] trying to get something from us that he
[47:51] created us for so it behoove us then to
[47:55] understand understand that God has has
[47:57] has invested um um um an investment in
[48:01] me cuz there's something in there that
[48:03] he wants out of me it's just like the
[48:06] child you got a little your child and
[48:07] you start he starts crawling and whatnot
[48:09] you he starts talking and babbling and
[48:11] whatnot the mother's going you you you
[48:14] you're putting something in that child
[48:15] you want to get something back out of it
[48:17] and you say Mama Mama Mama and Daddy's
[48:21] over there going Daddy Daddy
[48:23] Daddy he going say m first going to say
[48:26] Daddy first what are you expecting to
[48:28] get back out of that child right you're
[48:30] not wanting Newton's Second Law
[48:32] thermodynamics right you don't don't
[48:35] want some Einstein theory you don't want
[48:36] some homiletical exra jues you're
[48:38] looking for to get out of it what you
[48:40] put in it and what he's putting in US is
[48:43] what he what he wants preach to him and
[48:45] testified to him and spoken to him see
[48:47] what I'm saying only what he's and if
[48:49] it's not if he's not not first put it in
[48:51] us he won't accept it he won't accept it
[48:54] now that's right brother amen
[48:56] so Jesus spoke that that this Spirit now
[49:00] in the
[49:00] bride would would would come to this
[49:03] Perfection be made perfect when the
[49:04] church would come to its adoption right
[49:07] so I want us so what I want us to do
[49:09] just for a few minutes tonight is to
[49:11] Simply gauge
[49:13] ourselves compare ourselves and what we
[49:16] now possess to what was before
[49:20] prophesied would be here and in us right
[49:24] now there's no question this word this
[49:27] message this Revelation properly placed
[49:31] properly understood and properly
[49:34] approached will produce this
[49:37] corresponding quality of spirit that
[49:39] nobody else can display but bride Jesus
[49:42] is talking to bride see amen glory so
[49:46] you cannot at this time have Christ and
[49:50] not have this maturity or not be moving
[49:53] toward this maturity right this quality
[49:56] of spirit you remember what brother mam
[49:58] told us when he come back from Beyond
[49:59] the curtain of time he said nothing
[50:02] enters here but what perfect love mature
[50:06] love is that right right right in the
[50:08] message condolences to the stadle family
[50:12] he said and just then he said the angel
[50:14] talking about the angel talked when he's
[50:15] talking to over there said this is
[50:17] perfect love this is what you've taught
[50:19] yeah so an angel comes to the prophet of
[50:20] God say what you're experiencing over
[50:22] here in the sixth Dimension this is what
[50:23] you've taught this is perfect love right
[50:26] exactly beyond the curtain of time 1961
[50:30] Jeff old brother said I more convinced
[50:32] now that ever in my life that would that
[50:35] that it will take perfect love to enter
[50:37] that place amen amen you don't go there
[50:40] to get perfect love you put it on here
[50:42] it matures here he said and there was no
[50:45] jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old
[50:47] age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy
[50:50] Hallelujah he said whatever you do lay
[50:53] aside everything else till you get that
[50:55] perfect love get to where you can love
[50:58] everybody even every enemy no matter if
[51:00] your plane is rocking the lightning is
[51:02] flashing or The Guns of the enemy are
[51:04] upon you these things do not matter get
[51:07] perfect love so these pressing issues
[51:11] and we've all got them in our lives
[51:12] always pressing issues those things that
[51:14] trouble us those besetting sins what you
[51:17] want to do you want to understand as the
[51:19] prophet of God said these things do not
[51:21] matter don't get distracted by these
[51:23] things he said get perfect love amen now
[51:27] Lord if I'm understanding this correctly
[51:30] that this living group must then without
[51:34] question display that matured love here
[51:39] on here before we get our before we get
[51:41] our body changed right now we know that
[51:45] that there will be an atmosphere then
[51:48] created and projected Among Us when that
[51:52] process now comes to its maturity that
[51:54] brother B felt and witnessed they went
[51:56] that beyond the curtain of time all
[51:58] right so that's got to be here then
[52:01] before we go there so think of it now he
[52:04] said there was no Envy no jealousy
[52:07] nobody mad at the next guy nobody with
[52:09] bitterness in their heart toward one
[52:11] another nobody with an attitude problem
[52:14] you didn't hear anybody say well I know
[52:15] more than you I saw this before you did
[52:17] I go to brother brother so and so's
[52:19] church was there no unresolved uh uh
[52:23] issues there no attitude
[52:26] problems no no no offenses there no
[52:29] secret centers just a constant flow of
[52:32] unfeigned unpretentious unconditional
[52:36] genuine mature Agape Love No Limits to
[52:40] it no walls No Boundaries on their love
[52:43] just pure as the driven snow this
[52:46] brother sister is perfect love this is
[52:49] the love of God that only the Bride Can
[52:53] display are you with me amen amen so
[52:57] they in this experience now that is in
[53:00] his translation the millions that he saw
[53:03] there they literally become the gauge of
[53:06] what we must be before we leave this
[53:09] human existence oh my come on all right
[53:12] because you don't go over there to get
[53:14] this perfect love to put it on here
[53:16] brother man said death doesn't change
[53:17] your nature right it only changes your
[53:20] what Your Dwelling Place see amen now I
[53:23] think it brother sister important
[53:25] understand this because brother bam
[53:27] taught us now that we've been returned
[53:29] to a restored Eden again in the
[53:31] spiritual sense that God's first family
[53:33] had right and and his last family also
[53:36] has righten true sunship he called it
[53:39] amen perfect communion and fellowship
[53:41] with God who would condescend to Adam
[53:43] his first family and Eve in the evening
[53:46] time to walk with him and talk with him
[53:48] he had access to the tree of life he had
[53:51] the authority he had the power he was a
[53:53] manifesting son here upon the Earth
[53:55] right right all right now that was the
[53:57] condition then watch what brother says
[53:58] in the breach on page 103 he said God's
[54:01] law require required a a kinsman
[54:04] redeemer that's right and the lamb come
[54:05] out boldly and said I'm their Kinsman
[54:07] I'm the Redeemer amen I now have made
[54:09] intercession for them and now I've come
[54:12] to claim their rights for them amen I've
[54:16] come to claim their rights in that they
[54:18] have a right to everything that was lost
[54:21] in the fall think that talking about
[54:24] talking to us right toally believer you
[54:26] have a right to everything they fell
[54:28] from you got a right to it
[54:29] now everything they lost in the fall he
[54:32] goes I've paid the price he said oh
[54:35] brother don't that make you feel
[54:36] religious that's right he goes on to say
[54:39] now but in this
[54:40] Sevenfold uh book of seals of redemption
[54:43] that the lamb took within himself was
[54:46] the only one who could do it amen and he
[54:49] took it from the right hand of him that
[54:50] sat upon the throne now to claim his
[54:52] Redemptive to claim his rights to claim
[54:55] for me and you what he redeemed us from
[54:59] right to right all right what he redeem
[55:02] us to know he redeemed us from what he
[55:05] redeemed us to back to everything that
[55:08] Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he has
[55:11] redeemed us back to that which is what
[55:13] our inheritance he redeemed us back to
[55:15] that all right now watch he had already
[55:19] redeemed us back to that right see we've
[55:23] just now been renewed in that knowledge
[55:27] Paul in Colossians 3:10 he said he said
[55:29] in the new man the inward man he said is
[55:32] now renewed in that knowledge in the
[55:34] image of him exactly see renewed now in
[55:37] that knowledge cuz we know we were with
[55:38] him there but now we've been renewed in
[55:41] a knowledge now that we were privileged
[55:43] to to understand then we we're renewed
[55:47] in that knowledge not com to new
[55:49] knowledge but a knowledge that at some
[55:50] point in time Glory you see what I'm
[55:52] saying but what else did they have in
[55:55] Satan's Eden brother bam said page 19 he
[55:58] said they were Hol veiled right they
[56:01] were safe in God's pilion right they
[56:03] were alive right they had no death
[56:05] around them Hallelujah now watch they
[56:07] had perfect love one for the other
[56:11] perfect life forever they had perfect
[56:14] love perfect understanding of the love
[56:17] of God they had God's word and they kept
[56:20] it and they were alive and safe and
[56:23] God's eaten with no death around at all
[56:26] right that's right so you see why it's
[56:28] crucial for us tonight brother sister
[56:30] that we have a good understanding or a
[56:32] complete understanding or a perfect
[56:34] understanding as Adam and Eve did of
[56:36] perfect love amen see so what what may
[56:39] be the real lesson in Matthew
[56:42] 5:43 that Jesus is W wanting us to see
[56:45] is the mystery of perfect love right
[56:47] could be the real lesson there
[56:48] regardless right I'm telling you brother
[56:50] and sister if we can view every man
[56:52] equally now under this anointing right
[56:55] then we're beginning to come into an
[56:57] alignment with what they functioned
[57:00] under over on the other side right
[57:02] because let me say it again hear me they
[57:06] are our gauge of what we are ordained to
[57:10] and must become right all
[57:13] right recognizing your day death doesn't
[57:15] do nothing to a man but change his
[57:17] Dwelling Place doesn't change your
[57:18] nature doesn't change your faith doesn't
[57:19] change nothing in you but your dwelling
[57:21] place so which way your nature is this
[57:24] morning right right I'm talking about
[57:26] something that's that's here today and
[57:28] gone tomorrow not something that's
[57:30] controlled by circumstances and events
[57:33] uh that changes with emotional
[57:35] variations not something that vacillates
[57:38] with the total in your checkbook or the
[57:40] weather outside but something that's
[57:42] real something that's enduring and it's
[57:44] lasting something that's lived out
[57:47] automatically as fruit that grows from a
[57:50] branch do you follow me amen I'm not
[57:52] talking about intellectual procedure how
[57:55] much you know or don't know is I am that
[57:57] true quality of spirit that no doubt
[58:00] many in the M might have just missed oh
[58:02] my this is what perfect Faith perfect
[58:04] love will produced right brother bman
[58:07] the message Abraham restored Long Beach
[58:09] 1961 he said he's got to have a church
[58:12] that to uh to make that Capstone come on
[58:15] it's got to come on there perfect right
[58:17] and the church has got to draw into
[58:19] Perfection you say perfection that's
[58:21] what he said referring back to Jesus in
[58:23] Matthew 5:43 be you perfect as my Father
[58:26] in Heaven is perfect so again again is
[58:29] quoting Matthew
[58:31] 5:43 and again the word there is tellios
[58:34] or wholesome or unimpaired or innocent
[58:36] having Integrity amen one definition
[58:38] said what is completely and entirely in
[58:41] accord with truth and fact I like that
[58:45] definition right so this is the
[58:47] condition getting back to Genesis 17
[58:50] this is the condition that Abraham was
[58:52] required to be in prior to his body
[58:55] changed exactly Jesus and Paul in the
[58:57] New Testament essentially say the same
[58:59] thing with respect to the condition of
[59:01] the Bride in this hour y so when Jesus
[59:03] tells us to be therefore perfect he is
[59:06] in effect giving us his own description
[59:09] of the church at Rapture time right let
[59:12] me say it again he's giving us his own
[59:14] description of the church the elected
[59:16] blood watch church at Rapture time all
[59:20] right perfect Faith Amen brother Adam
[59:23] said in august 19 63 he said so when a
[59:25] man lives by faith walks by faith I mean
[59:28] substance Faith right he's isolated from
[59:30] the entire world becomes a new creature
[59:32] in Christ now you're getting into bride
[59:36] material you're getting into rapturing
[59:38] condition now that means each one of us
[59:40] I just a pastor Deacon trust these that
[59:42] means for the Le every individual walks
[59:46] in a world with God Alone you're
[59:48] baptized into his kingdom there's nobody
[59:50] in there but you and God see he gives
[59:53] the orders you pack them out y whatever
[59:55] he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt
[59:57] nowhere you right is he is he describing
[1:00:00] you here that's right Ian he's describe
[1:00:03] us here I believe we all say yep yep
[1:00:05] that's me that's me that's me looking in
[1:00:07] the perfect law of Liberty reflecting
[1:00:08] back amen the very image of the word
[1:00:10] very thing he's talking that's rapt and
[1:00:12] condition walking alone with God he
[1:00:14] gives you orders you pack them out yes
[1:00:16] Lord yes Lord yes Lord thank you Lord he
[1:00:19] says now there's not a doubt nowhere if
[1:00:21] the Lord says this nobody in the world
[1:00:22] can talk you out of it right nobody in
[1:00:25] the world can talk you out of you just
[1:00:27] go right on justce a you're coming into
[1:00:30] perfect Faith perfect
[1:00:31] Perfection that cannot fail that faith
[1:00:34] never fails amen yeah he was a Mystic to
[1:00:37] them with his perfect faith and so is it
[1:00:39] now with those who have perfect Faith
[1:00:41] are a Mystic to others right right so
[1:00:46] the thought implied
[1:00:47] here in Matthew
[1:00:49] 5:48 is be full grown be mature men
[1:00:53] right be men of consumate and women men
[1:00:57] and women of consumate human integrity
[1:01:01] and virtue amen you know what that means
[1:01:03] it means to be skillful it means to be
[1:01:06] accomplished the dictionary defines
[1:01:08] Integrity as the quality of always
[1:01:11] behaving according to the moral
[1:01:13] principles that you believe in right so
[1:01:15] that people respect and trust you glory
[1:01:18] virtue simply speaks of the quality of
[1:01:20] being morally good or righteous right
[1:01:22] now let me drop this in before we before
[1:01:24] I continue on when the bride matures to
[1:01:28] this condition of perfection that Jesus
[1:01:31] is talking about according to Hebrews
[1:01:34] 5:14 the strong mean of the word
[1:01:36] mentioned it earlier belongs to her and
[1:01:39] at that time she begins to exercise her
[1:01:42] discernment to know good from Evil
[1:01:45] righteousness from wickedness right now
[1:01:47] now listen don't ever underestimate how
[1:01:49] thankful we should be in this hour to
[1:01:51] have this type of discernment because
[1:01:53] we're told by prophet in that many in
[1:01:55] this day will call evil good and good
[1:01:57] evil right Isaiah 5: 20 right what are
[1:02:00] them that call evil good and good evil
[1:02:03] that put light for darkness and darkness
[1:02:05] for light that put bitter for sweet and
[1:02:07] Sweet for bitter so there's a prophecy
[1:02:10] now that that uh that uh Finds Its way
[1:02:13] down to the last day amen so it's we
[1:02:15] want to call good good and evil evil
[1:02:18] brother bam said in God in Simplicity
[1:02:19] page 17 he said you know what man calls
[1:02:22] great sometimes is not great
[1:02:25] what God calls great man calls foolish
[1:02:27] what God calls foolish man calls great
[1:02:29] so let's bear that in mind and let's
[1:02:31] weigh every every word I'm telling you
[1:02:34] if we didn't have this discernment I'm
[1:02:35] tell you where we'd be tonight tell you
[1:02:37] where we'd be where what we'd be
[1:02:38] believing what we'd be looking
[1:02:40] at brother Benin God being misunderstood
[1:02:43] he says you don't want a wrong Spirit
[1:02:46] you want the right Spirit impersonation
[1:02:48] of Christianity Jeff he said and create
[1:02:51] in US Lord creating us the right kind of
[1:02:53] spirit to let the Holy Spirit control us
[1:02:55] and lead us and guide us as we journey
[1:02:57] on in the Mage enticing Spirits Jeff 55
[1:03:00] he said created me a clean Spirit see
[1:03:02] what God will do God will do it this
[1:03:05] morning amen see where he's directing
[1:03:07] that talking about a clean Spirit a
[1:03:08] right Spirit a clean Spirit seed is not
[1:03:10] a with the sh jel 65 and Lord created me
[1:03:12] a good spirit now I read these
[1:03:15] statements to show that God does in fact
[1:03:17] deal with our human spirit in a
[1:03:19] spiritual way right because my human
[1:03:21] Spirit can be a right Spirit or a wrong
[1:03:23] Spirit right
[1:03:24] again he said God being misunderstood
[1:03:26] you don't want a wrong Spirit you want
[1:03:28] the right
[1:03:29] spirit so I want you to understand and
[1:03:32] recognize that we're now living in a
[1:03:34] process right wherein Jesus Christ is
[1:03:38] perfecting our Justified Spirit on
[1:03:41] through our troubles and our trials and
[1:03:43] our adversity and the persecutions and
[1:03:46] such see as it's maturing us to this
[1:03:50] perfect love are you still with me right
[1:03:52] amen now Jesus teaching in Matthew 5 is
[1:03:56] unquestionably anchored and rooted in
[1:03:59] the principle of love right and it's
[1:04:02] here that he introduces a new attitude a
[1:04:05] new response that he wants to see in his
[1:04:07] people yeah it's no longer evil for evil
[1:04:10] right it's no longer persecution for
[1:04:12] persecution no longer you did this to me
[1:04:15] I'm going to do that to you right right
[1:04:17] he begins verse 43 by saying you have
[1:04:20] heard it's been said it's been taught
[1:04:24] was written but now Jesus says under
[1:04:26] grace I'm going to bring another
[1:04:28] attitude I'm going to bring another
[1:04:31] disposition to you amen all right so he
[1:04:34] says now I say in other words there got
[1:04:38] to be something different come now yeah
[1:04:40] and going to be a different response
[1:04:42] there's going to be a different
[1:04:44] understanding of God the character of
[1:04:45] God the nature of God there's going to
[1:04:47] be another reaction you're going to
[1:04:49] display when you're inured right is no
[1:04:52] longer going to be rendered evil for
[1:04:53] evil but rather good for evil right Paul
[1:04:56] would later write to the Romans
[1:04:58] 12:4 bless them that persecute you bless
[1:05:02] and curse not verse 17 recompense to no
[1:05:06] man evil for evil provide things honest
[1:05:09] in the sight of all men verse 21 be not
[1:05:12] overcome of evil but overcome evil with
[1:05:16] good right now this is a tough one for
[1:05:19] the flesh man brother sister but if we
[1:05:21] can remember brother bam said he he said
[1:05:23] listen that a Christian will always give
[1:05:26] you the benefit of the doubt exactly a
[1:05:28] lot of misunderstandings a lot of
[1:05:30] troubles can be avoided if we just
[1:05:31] remember to give that brother give that
[1:05:33] sister even down to your enemy give them
[1:05:35] the benefit of the doubt amen right so
[1:05:38] we said a Christian will always do that
[1:05:40] so that's what we're going to do right
[1:05:41] to our brother our sister our adversary
[1:05:43] even our enemy amen whoever he might be
[1:05:46] when there's a misunderstanding when
[1:05:47] there's a dispute of some sort right
[1:05:49] right so what now what now begins to
[1:05:52] surface and come into Focus for us is
[1:05:56] the truth that we've got to consciously
[1:05:59] and deliberately deal with our own
[1:06:01] spirit and attitude now and I'll say it
[1:06:04] again this is a manifestation of our
[1:06:07] placing this is all part of the maturing
[1:06:10] that the Bride Comes to right it all
[1:06:12] comes down now to personal
[1:06:14] confrontations right I'm not talking
[1:06:16] about confronting one or another there's
[1:06:17] a time for that but I'm talking about
[1:06:19] confronting our own issues right our own
[1:06:22] problems right see because eventually
[1:06:25] before we leave this human existence
[1:06:27] we'll all have to personally confront
[1:06:29] every area of our lives under this
[1:06:32] glorious Morning Light that's come to us
[1:06:35] in the end time and understand nobody is
[1:06:38] exempt from it right amen is see my
[1:06:40] conduct in my home my conduct on the job
[1:06:43] my conduct with friends and families and
[1:06:45] even in the presence of my enemies amen
[1:06:47] I'll have to confront my relationship
[1:06:50] with God my prayer life my study time
[1:06:52] see what I mean right means that we feel
[1:06:54] more comfortable ignoring or sweeping
[1:06:57] aside even down to our fears and phobias
[1:07:00] and such we have to come to a personal
[1:07:04] confrontation with ourselves and this is
[1:07:06] exactly what Paul taught us to do in
[1:07:09] second Corinthians 13 and verse 5 he
[1:07:11] said examine yourself whether you be in
[1:07:13] the faith right exactly he said prove
[1:07:16] your own selves right The Net Bible says
[1:07:20] prove yourselves I'm sorry put yourself
[1:07:22] to the test to see if in the faith right
[1:07:25] the new Amplified Standard Bible says
[1:07:27] test yourself to see if you're in the
[1:07:28] faith examine yourself or do you not
[1:07:31] recognize this about yourself that Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ is in you unless indeed you fail
[1:07:36] the test right the message version says
[1:07:38] test yourself to make sure you're solid
[1:07:40] in the faith Don't Drift along taking
[1:07:42] everything for granted give yourselves
[1:07:44] regular checkups you need firsthand
[1:07:47] evidence not near hears s that Jesus
[1:07:50] Christ is in you test it out if you fail
[1:07:52] the test do something about it
[1:07:54] and this is exactly the point that I've
[1:07:57] been stressing to you for the last 45
[1:07:59] minutes testing ourselves confronting
[1:08:01] ourselves with our newly growing newly
[1:08:04] developing character amen see how is my
[1:08:07] attitude now toward my enemy toward my
[1:08:09] brother toward my family toward the
[1:08:11] believer toward the unbeliever how's my
[1:08:13] attitude toward the message how's my
[1:08:15] attitude toward life right I when things
[1:08:18] go our way when things don't go our way
[1:08:20] do we pout do we fuss Do We complain do
[1:08:22] we grip we score on that test brother
[1:08:25] sister right do we pass that test or do
[1:08:28] we adopt the attitude of the Prophet to
[1:08:31] where he said in flashing red light the
[1:08:32] sign of his coming he said oh
[1:08:34] God he says I he says give me Grace
[1:08:37] never to
[1:08:39] complain he said I know that someday
[1:08:41] I've got to die I hope God never lets
[1:08:43] Satan Crown me as an old crabbed in
[1:08:47] different man with my wife an old
[1:08:49] nagging woman and or your wife or you
[1:08:52] that way right amen I pray brother that
[1:08:56] our lives will be crowed with the fruits
[1:08:57] of the spirit love joy suffering gentl
[1:08:59] patience truth faith in the holy spirit
[1:09:02] amen God give me Grace never to complain
[1:09:06] that's an easy quote to remember if you
[1:09:07] don't remember nothing else I said
[1:09:09] tonight you will remember that and your
[1:09:11] pastor will probably remind you of that
[1:09:13] from time to
[1:09:14] time that's right manifested Sons
[1:09:16] brother said the thing I want to try to
[1:09:18] get to you is this that a man that is in
[1:09:21] Christ with the Holy Ghost can bear with
[1:09:24] a man when he's
[1:09:25] wrong longsuffering gentle patient he's
[1:09:28] sweet humble faithful filled with the
[1:09:31] spirit never negative always positive
[1:09:35] he's a different person right boy it's
[1:09:37] getting tough now a it God give me Grace
[1:09:40] never to complain give me Grace never to
[1:09:43] be negative always to be
[1:09:46] positive Lord that's where we want to
[1:09:48] start right there he said he's a
[1:09:49] different person amen and we are
[1:09:51] different people we are different right
[1:09:54] but how do we know unless we examine
[1:09:56] ourselves and put ourselves to the test
[1:09:58] to see if we're in the faith in the good
[1:10:01] times in the bad times when you got
[1:10:04] money when you got bills laid on the
[1:10:06] table and you don't know how you're
[1:10:06] going to pay them right see testing our
[1:10:09] attitudes toward one another our every
[1:10:12] word that we speak our thoughts toward
[1:10:14] toward toward an issue our motives our
[1:10:17] Ambitions our goals our desires as well
[1:10:20] as our reaction to injury most
[1:10:22] importantly our own spirit amen because
[1:10:25] as I've said our spirit if our spirit is
[1:10:27] Right everything else is going to fall
[1:10:29] into place right that's it amen even
[1:10:31] that's the spirit of truth brother B
[1:10:33] says no matter how little it is or how
[1:10:36] great it is it's just the same in the
[1:10:39] sight of God always the same to act
[1:10:43] right in the place where you're at right
[1:10:45] always it's a great thing to follow the
[1:10:47] Lord amen no matter where you're at in
[1:10:50] this 24-hour day that God gives you
[1:10:52] every day listen he said just act right
[1:10:55] do right act right be right think right
[1:10:58] he said you're bound to come out right
[1:10:59] that was his little M you know he talk
[1:11:01] talked about act right he said no no God
[1:11:04] doesn't look at as a big thing or a
[1:11:05] little thing we kind of gauge our trials
[1:11:07] that's a big trial that's a little trial
[1:11:09] oh I get through that I don't need God's
[1:11:10] help I don't need to pray about that you
[1:11:11] do need
[1:11:12] to no matter how great how little it's
[1:11:15] all the same in the sight of God just
[1:11:17] act right where you're at all great
[1:11:20] things right am so what am I saying we
[1:11:22] got to confront ourselves
[1:11:24] right we got to prove ourselves why so
[1:11:26] we'll know that we are absolutely in the
[1:11:29] faith listen brother and sisters and not
[1:11:30] just uttering some vain confession about
[1:11:32] who we are and what we've got right
[1:11:34] right exactly you say well I believe the
[1:11:36] message I go to church I pay my tithes
[1:11:38] and offerings I believe in one God isn't
[1:11:40] that enough not for the bride it's
[1:11:42] not James 2:19 thou Believers there's
[1:11:45] one God th do as well the devil's also
[1:11:47] believe and
[1:11:48] tremble right listen to what your
[1:11:50] Prophet said in the message once faith
[1:11:52] wants delivered to the saint he said if
[1:11:54] all you have to do is believe that God
[1:11:56] is and you kneel down and worship him
[1:11:59] then Cain was justified right the Bible
[1:12:01] said that even the devil believes it to
[1:12:02] be the truth and the devil publicly
[1:12:04] confessed that Jesus to be the Son of
[1:12:06] God he said I didn't save him he said
[1:12:09] brother we better get straight down
[1:12:10] right got to be a mistake one of the
[1:12:12] days somebody's right and somebody's
[1:12:13] wrong you better take what the Bible
[1:12:14] said you got to be born again not
[1:12:16] mystical think you're born again but
[1:12:19] when the spirit absolutely kills
[1:12:21] everything in the world in you you
[1:12:23] regenerated a new creature in Christ you
[1:12:26] know the old things has passed away if
[1:12:28] you still love the world the things of
[1:12:29] the world the Bible said the love of God
[1:12:30] is not even in you he said amen he said
[1:12:32] that was plain brother he said but it's
[1:12:34] not whitewashed he said it'll wash you
[1:12:37] white exactly examining ourselves
[1:12:40] confronting ourselves right you remember
[1:12:42] in the message running from the presence
[1:12:43] of the Lord I think which was might have
[1:12:45] been the first message that he preached
[1:12:46] in that series of February 1965 when he
[1:12:50] when he preached uh who is this mzc
[1:12:52] marriage and divorce and so forth he
[1:12:53] started off by preaching running from
[1:12:55] the presence of the Lord and you know
[1:12:56] how the first I don't know 8 10 pages
[1:12:58] brother B him saying how man is always
[1:13:01] prone to run from responsibilities right
[1:13:03] he said whether you're a housewife or
[1:13:05] farmer factory worker whatever it is he
[1:13:07] said you owe he said you owe it to God
[1:13:09] to give your best to that man you're
[1:13:10] working for not as men Pleasers see but
[1:13:13] as but as but as Servants of the Living
[1:13:15] God he said ministers he said run from
[1:13:17] the responsibility of taking this
[1:13:18] message amen and rolling up their
[1:13:20] sleeves and preaching the truth whether
[1:13:22] it will cut or Rend or tear whatever
[1:13:24] shut the he of it makes no difference
[1:13:26] it's the truth brother amen and it'll
[1:13:28] get you to where you want to go amen
[1:13:31] that's right so he says he tell how we
[1:13:32] running from responsibility and he spent
[1:13:35] a quite a bit of time telling us that
[1:13:37] we've got to confront our
[1:13:38] responsibilities he said because we've
[1:13:40] got to be accountable to
[1:13:42] God and also he said now not only that
[1:13:46] but we've got to be accountable to one
[1:13:47] another that's right man
[1:13:49] see I probably spent you we when I
[1:13:52] started the series probably spent
[1:13:54] several weeks just looking at jesus'
[1:13:56] teachings on accountability and our
[1:13:58] requirement to keep a clean sleep right
[1:14:01] uh before God and and towards all men
[1:14:04] always having forgiveness in our hearts
[1:14:06] for not only the Saints but our enemies
[1:14:08] as well amen those in the camp and those
[1:14:11] outside the camp right what happens if
[1:14:13] we don't what happens if we don't let me
[1:14:15] read it to you right Jesus in Matthew
[1:14:18] 5:23 he said therefore if you bring your
[1:14:20] gift to The Altar and remember that your
[1:14:22] brother has ought against you leave
[1:14:24] there thy gift before the altar go thy
[1:14:27] way first be reconciled with the brother
[1:14:30] and then come and offer thy gift agree
[1:14:32] with thine adversary quickly while Thou
[1:14:34] Art in the way with him lest in any time
[1:14:36] the adversary deliver you to the judge
[1:14:39] and the judge deliver you to the officer
[1:14:41] and you be cast into prison right verily
[1:14:44] I say thou shalt by no means come out th
[1:14:47] till thou H has paid the uttermost fary
[1:14:51] rightly and that's about 13 of a penny
[1:14:55] in Matthew uh Matthew 18:34 Jesus Is
[1:14:58] Telling another uh story about a man who
[1:15:00] was forgiven much and he turned around
[1:15:02] and held another man liable for some
[1:15:04] smaller dep and when the when the when
[1:15:06] the servant the master heard of it he
[1:15:08] was wough 18:34 and delivered him to the
[1:15:13] tormentors till he should pay all that
[1:15:15] was due him so likewise so likewise
[1:15:19] shall my heavenly father do also unto
[1:15:21] you that's right if you from your hearts
[1:15:24] will not forgive everyone his brother
[1:15:26] their
[1:15:27] trespasses he ensures that you will in
[1:15:31] no way in no wise Harbor resentment ill
[1:15:34] will offenses or whatnot towards your
[1:15:37] brother Jesus said I will not let that
[1:15:39] happen not from home that's right so if
[1:15:42] we have ought with our brother or our
[1:15:44] sister or even our enemy Jesus says you
[1:15:47] leave your gift at the altar and make
[1:15:50] that thing right I won't even receive
[1:15:52] your gift I want even receive wor don't
[1:15:54] even bother praying to me amen and he
[1:15:57] said if we don't do
[1:15:59] it he says we're turned over to the
[1:16:01] judge the adversary now the adversary
[1:16:04] turns you the offended party turns you
[1:16:07] over to the judge the judge turns you
[1:16:08] over to the Jailer which is a nice way
[1:16:10] to say Tormentor yeah right which he
[1:16:13] uses the word Tormentor it's only used
[1:16:14] one time you know what you know what the
[1:16:15] Tormentor is here here here's what
[1:16:17] here's what the uh the dolot says one
[1:16:21] who elicits the truth by the use of the
[1:16:26] rack right I don't think we use them
[1:16:28] they might use them down in guantan I'm
[1:16:29] not sure you hear a lot of funny things
[1:16:30] com out we don't know what to use water
[1:16:32] board R Who car whatever
[1:16:35] right but Jesus says he's and he's very
[1:16:38] demonstrative he's very he's very uh
[1:16:42] he's very colorful here when he says he
[1:16:44] says look you're going to deliver you to
[1:16:46] the torment it's one who elicits Truth
[1:16:48] by use of the rack you know you know
[1:16:50] Medieval Times you know n us there you
[1:16:52] know put you on the r and they tie you
[1:16:53] down they start going click click click
[1:16:55] click click click I don't know about you
[1:16:56] but I'm confessing name rank serial
[1:16:58] number whatever else you want to know
[1:16:59] I'm giving up oh oh my
[1:17:02] God how manyan ever been on the rack
[1:17:05] I've been on the rack before it don't
[1:17:06] feel good either and I never got no toer
[1:17:09] either I'm still
[1:17:11] 5'8 one who elicits Truth by the use of
[1:17:14] the rack right an Inquisitor a
[1:17:17] torturer also used of a Jailer doubtless
[1:17:20] because the business of torturing was
[1:17:22] also a to him and Jesus says I will turn
[1:17:25] you over to him oh my if you want to
[1:17:27] hold forgive you think it's you think
[1:17:29] it's you know just a little thing it's
[1:17:30] not a big thing you think it'll just go
[1:17:32] away you think God will just bypass look
[1:17:34] at no no no no no no he said you don't
[1:17:36] get rid of that thing get that thing out
[1:17:37] of your heart I'm going to turn you
[1:17:39] right over to the jail of the Tormentor
[1:17:40] and you're going right to the rack right
[1:17:43] am see so he sends us to a debtor's
[1:17:46] prison he puts us on the rack and he
[1:17:48] says you're going to stay there until a
[1:17:50] righteous recompense comes forth from
[1:17:52] your lips
[1:17:53] oh my come on think about that amen amen
[1:17:57] verely I say to you thou shall no means
[1:17:59] come out F until youve paid the utter
[1:18:02] uttermost far than 38 of the sin right
[1:18:06] so we' got to here now confront our
[1:18:07] willingness to keep the Sleep clean in
[1:18:10] other words our accountability to one
[1:18:11] another right because we have the
[1:18:13] responsibility to love our enemies bless
[1:18:16] them that curse you do good to them that
[1:18:18] hate you pray for them to despitefully
[1:18:19] use you and persecute you that what that
[1:18:22] you may be the children of your father
[1:18:25] which is in heaven
[1:18:26] amen right it's an expression of sun
[1:18:29] right so everything comes under
[1:18:31] examination in this hour amen I'm not
[1:18:34] going to expound on it but 1 Corinthians
[1:18:35] 3:13 now watch this every man's work
[1:18:38] shall be made manifest for the day
[1:18:40] exactly the day of the Lord this this is
[1:18:42] the day the Lord has made the day shall
[1:18:45] declare it because it shall be revealed
[1:18:47] by fire the return of the pillar of fire
[1:18:50] amen amen and the fire shall try every
[1:18:52] Every Man's work what sort it is that's
[1:18:56] right
[1:18:56] amen it all boils down to this love this
[1:19:00] this Capstone this perfect love love
[1:19:02] your neighbor love one another love your
[1:19:03] enemy love love love that's the whole
[1:19:05] theme of the New Testament is it amen
[1:19:07] that's
[1:19:08] right you remember John the Apostle John
[1:19:11] he's he goes out he's exiled to the a of
[1:19:14] patmas he spends two and a half years
[1:19:15] out two years out there I think it was
[1:19:17] sees this great vision of the end time
[1:19:19] he sees the rise of the Antichrist he
[1:19:22] sees the uh he sees the seals he hears
[1:19:24] the Thunders utter he sees the uh the
[1:19:27] tribulation period he sees the wrath of
[1:19:29] God poured out he sees all of these
[1:19:31] various things and John now when he
[1:19:33] comes back to his church that's I think
[1:19:36] around 90 92 years old he pastors the
[1:19:37] Ephesian church I think for two years
[1:19:39] and he says in the third verse or third
[1:19:41] chapter 11th verse of First John he said
[1:19:44] this is the message you've heard from
[1:19:45] the beginning that we should love one
[1:19:48] another it was the message in the
[1:19:50] beginning it's the message in the end
[1:19:52] love one another right so it's all about
[1:19:55] love and this love only comes by first
[1:19:58] conversion and then a maturing process
[1:20:01] amen the whole new testament is built
[1:20:03] around the principle of love and that's
[1:20:05] why brother man said love is the
[1:20:06] greatest power the greatest forth it
[1:20:09] overcomes everything what does love amen
[1:20:12] in a message Called Love in stre 456 he
[1:20:14] said I think love is the greatest Force
[1:20:16] there is in the world there's nothing
[1:20:18] more powerful than love Jesus Christ the
[1:20:20] same in Charlotte 56 he says love will
[1:20:23] do just just do things that nothing else
[1:20:26] will do God projecting his love Edmund
[1:20:29] and Alberta he said love is the greatest
[1:20:30] force that ever was put in the power of
[1:20:33] man what is yeah what is some radio
[1:20:37] control missile device some hang grenade
[1:20:39] some some some uh machine gun no it said
[1:20:42] love is the greatest power that's put
[1:20:44] into the possession of man amen he said
[1:20:47] in the message God commissioning Moses
[1:20:49] the prophet in Jonesburg Arkansas he
[1:20:51] said I find this at the greatest power
[1:20:53] in the world is not the atomic bomb
[1:20:56] right but a believer in contact with his
[1:20:58] Mak it changes the whole attitude
[1:21:01] changes his mental changes his habit
[1:21:04] changes his body changes his nature
[1:21:06] everything he says then how could dot
[1:21:08] dot dot right that's right in all of
[1:21:11] this the prophet is saying that in
[1:21:14] adoption at maturity it will produce
[1:21:17] this quality this principle of love that
[1:21:20] is more powerful than indebtedness
[1:21:23] more powerful than injury more powerful
[1:21:25] than offense more powerful than disease
[1:21:28] and
[1:21:29] bitterness Jesus is telling us in
[1:21:31] Matthew 5 that when we come to the place
[1:21:33] where we begin to express this love as
[1:21:36] he's laid out here it will prove that we
[1:21:38] are children of our father amen
[1:21:42] right so when we begin to to to reflect
[1:21:46] or display this Divine love it will be
[1:21:49] brother sister a proof or let me say it
[1:21:52] like this and an identifiable evidence
[1:21:54] that you reene seed of God that's been
[1:21:57] matured and placed because remember
[1:21:59] brother Christ revealed his own word
[1:22:01] said there's nothing ever been like it
[1:22:04] or will be Hereafter the thing that's
[1:22:07] the matter with the message to they
[1:22:09] those who obtain it their hearts must
[1:22:11] lay in the presence of the sun to get
[1:22:14] ripen you pick up the message and then
[1:22:16] let the son of the sun bake all the
[1:22:18] greenness out of you make you matured
[1:22:20] Christians right you see what I mean
[1:22:22] coming soon him to receive his church we
[1:22:24] must have that type of Christian what
[1:22:26] type the perfect type the mature type
[1:22:29] for him to receive the wheat's got to
[1:22:32] get rip right amen so the ripening the
[1:22:35] ripening is what it's the end result of
[1:22:38] our
[1:22:38] placing and that is the displaying of
[1:22:41] this perfect Spirit which is a right
[1:22:44] reaction to personal injuries from our
[1:22:47] brothers and our sisters in the camp as
[1:22:50] well as our enemies and adversaries
[1:22:53] outside or beyond the C that's right so
[1:22:56] as we begin to examine ourselves under
[1:22:59] this end time light you can see this or
[1:23:02] be be aware of this transforming process
[1:23:05] that's taking you that's taking you from
[1:23:07] brotherly love to this Divine love that
[1:23:09] encompasses every man and woman friend
[1:23:12] or fool right because it reacts to
[1:23:14] injury right it reacts to offenses right
[1:23:16] right exactly so when Jesus tells us to
[1:23:18] be therefore perfect it's not only a
[1:23:21] call to material
[1:23:23] but he's telling us that love is a basic
[1:23:26] quality of sunship not just a FAL love
[1:23:29] but a mature adoption love a Capstone
[1:23:32] love a Divine love on display right a
[1:23:36] love that reveals the true disciple
[1:23:39] right Jesus is the one that said in John
[1:23:42] 13:34 a new commandment I give you that
[1:23:45] you love one another as I've loved you
[1:23:47] see that you love one another by this
[1:23:48] shall all men know that you are my
[1:23:51] disciples
[1:23:53] if you have right amen love one to
[1:23:57] another thank you Lord hallelujah so As
[1:24:00] We Lay in the presence lay in his
[1:24:02] presence glory and we view it in the
[1:24:04] mirror of his word as we eat from the
[1:24:06] Tree of Life what's it doing it's
[1:24:08] maturing our attitudes and our responses
[1:24:10] and our reactions in regard to every man
[1:24:12] especially our enemies it will develop
[1:24:15] in us a responsibility that God requires
[1:24:18] of us to be men to be adult to be grown
[1:24:20] up to be full age answer the call to the
[1:24:23] responsibilities of Jes
[1:24:26] amen so true love is going to be what
[1:24:28] it's going to be a mark of maturity
[1:24:30] right and if there's no maturity of true
[1:24:32] love then the very purpose of the
[1:24:34] indwelling Christ is missed right right
[1:24:37] so As We Lay in the presence as we eat
[1:24:39] from the Tree of Life from this restored
[1:24:40] Eden right it'll mature our attitudes in
[1:24:44] regard to others whether they be friends
[1:24:45] or f as we said that's right I'm winding
[1:24:49] down here but let me let let me say this
[1:24:53] this is this this is the love that's
[1:24:56] created or comes to to its fruition at
[1:25:00] Harvest Time among the True Believers
[1:25:03] and again if we only love the brothers
[1:25:04] that proves that we're born again Jesus
[1:25:05] said if you don't what what what than
[1:25:07] can it only proves we're born again but
[1:25:08] we're talking about being placed now
[1:25:10] right talking about perfection talking
[1:25:11] about maturity now right this is the
[1:25:13] time brother and sister where we where
[1:25:15] we approach God and man with a true
[1:25:18] revelation of Grace in our heart right
[1:25:20] see and it's displayed it's displayed in
[1:25:23] our reaction to others right see how
[1:25:26] else do we express Express the
[1:25:27] revelation of Grace if it's not if it's
[1:25:29] not to other people see how can you love
[1:25:31] God whom you haven't seen right when we
[1:25:34] can't love your brother whom you have
[1:25:35] seen right how can you pay your debt to
[1:25:37] God when you won't forgive your brother
[1:25:39] won't forgive your enemy right ain't
[1:25:41] going to happen in the message where I
[1:25:43] think Pentecost fail San Bernardino 1955
[1:25:45] brother man says and if you can't love
[1:25:47] your brother who you've seen how can you
[1:25:49] love God who you haven't seen and
[1:25:51] brother when love go goes out God goes
[1:25:53] with it did he tell us something like
[1:25:55] this when love projects what happens
[1:25:58] when love projects Grace takes over
[1:26:01] that's right amen yes sir love projected
[1:26:03] one day when he's walking through a
[1:26:05] walking through a bull's field is it
[1:26:07] walking through some field and a Bull
[1:26:08] jump up love projected what happened
[1:26:09] right he Liv to tell about it BR took
[1:26:13] over same with the Hornets or the yellow
[1:26:15] jackets or whatever it was what he just
[1:26:17] projected love oh I'm sorry little guys
[1:26:19] I didn't mean to didn't mean to invade
[1:26:20] your little your your little place here
[1:26:23] and what happened he left to tell about
[1:26:24] he didn't get stung to death Grace took
[1:26:26] over Love Project projecting love
[1:26:28] perfect love
[1:26:30] see he said brother when love goes out
[1:26:32] God goes with it for God is love right
[1:26:34] and you can never get anywhere without
[1:26:35] Divine love as long as you love your one
[1:26:37] another you love God that's right so
[1:26:40] this is God's way this is God's plan see
[1:26:43] we got to got to start looking at things
[1:26:44] at some point in time from from his
[1:26:46] perspective right as you're dealing with
[1:26:48] your brother you're dealing with God
[1:26:49] Amen because you can't live in disor
[1:26:52] pray with your brother or your sister
[1:26:54] and expect the channel of blessing with
[1:26:56] God to be open so there's a Divine love
[1:26:59] there's an atmosphere that accommodates
[1:27:01] or accompanies this placing of sons that
[1:27:04] must be displayed in the adoption season
[1:27:06] amen and that's where we are Amen in
[1:27:08] other words adoption calls for this
[1:27:11] Divine love to be here and expressed
[1:27:14] through Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:16] exactly 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you have
[1:27:19] purified your souls and obeying the
[1:27:21] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[1:27:25] love of the Brethren see that you love
[1:27:26] one another with a pure heart fervently
[1:27:30] right you know what unfeigned means
[1:27:32] unfeigned love it means without
[1:27:33] hypocrisy right right it means without
[1:27:36] disguise it means sincere it means
[1:27:38] genuine right so Peter says a genuine
[1:27:41] experience a genuine growth a genuine
[1:27:44] maturity will produce This Love Without
[1:27:47] hypocrisy right brother see hey brother
[1:27:49] how you doing sure love your brother
[1:27:50] sure appreciate your brother and then
[1:27:51] get you guard right home and just tear
[1:27:53] him down that's pretentious love that's
[1:27:55] hypocritical love that's not this unsane
[1:27:57] love so he says this true genuine unan
[1:28:02] love will produce will will will just
[1:28:05] Will Will just Vanquish hypocrisy right
[1:28:08] he said this love will supersede any
[1:28:09] other love the love of family friends
[1:28:12] neighbors material possession homes cars
[1:28:14] whatever it will supersede all of that
[1:28:16] right amen what I'm saying is this in
[1:28:19] closing we cannot have a correct love
[1:28:21] for the word of God the message of the
[1:28:23] hour without having a corresponding
[1:28:26] genuine love for the body of Christ I
[1:28:29] don't care where this body is or what
[1:28:31] they've done this new birth will respond
[1:28:33] by creating an atmosphere of love and
[1:28:36] will promote a correct response to each
[1:28:38] other it'll absolutely produce that
[1:28:41] that's right Jesus said in essence he
[1:28:43] said listen you'll always be well-minded
[1:28:45] toward the church right the brothers and
[1:28:48] sisters the officers the ministers and
[1:28:50] let me point out that Jesus said in
[1:28:52] Matthew 10:36 that our foes our enemies
[1:28:55] would be they of our own household that
[1:28:58] right your enemies will be they of your
[1:29:00] own household now that's both natural
[1:29:02] and spiritual where did Jesus get his
[1:29:04] wounds at right in the house of work
[1:29:07] House of his friends I don't know about
[1:29:08] you brother Dale but all the the wounds
[1:29:10] that I've got on me I mean I I a lot of
[1:29:12] spiritual wounds you going to see phys
[1:29:14] but they come from the house of my
[1:29:15] friends the Ministries that we've had in
[1:29:17] the assembly and this that and the other
[1:29:19] and whatnot you know they get the knife
[1:29:20] in the back and they turn it real good
[1:29:22] my biggest challenges my biggest
[1:29:25] difficulties that I've had and so forth
[1:29:27] the biggest trials have been from other
[1:29:29] people in the in the church just that
[1:29:31] way and Jesus promised that Jesus said
[1:29:34] that it would be Zechariah 13:6 and one
[1:29:37] shall say what are these wounds in mine
[1:29:38] hands and he shall answer those with
[1:29:40] which I was wounded in the house of my
[1:29:43] friends in the house of his friends not
[1:29:45] the drunkards not the drug pushers not
[1:29:47] the derel and the zealots of his day but
[1:29:49] in the household of faith those who
[1:29:51] claim to be in the m the truth be moan
[1:29:53] brother sister that's where we're going
[1:29:54] to get most of ours as well
[1:29:56] right our struggles our fights our our
[1:29:59] disagreements our contentions our
[1:30:01] debates our disputes where right in the
[1:30:03] message Community right amen we need to
[1:30:05] know that we need to remember that
[1:30:07] because you know what that's where the
[1:30:08] judases are that's where aen is that's
[1:30:11] where Janice and jambre are that's where
[1:30:14] Honus and felus are those are the two
[1:30:17] blasphemers that Paul had to deliver
[1:30:18] over to Satan concerning faith and good
[1:30:21] conscience had made shipwreck right when
[1:30:23] Paul wrote to Timothy of them he said in
[1:30:24] 2 Timothy 21718 their word do eat as a
[1:30:27] canker of whom H is and fitus who
[1:30:29] concerning the faith have have aired
[1:30:31] saying the resurrection pass over the
[1:30:32] face of that's where hus and fitus are
[1:30:36] or felis Hermes and Fel remember them
[1:30:38] right they were two they were the two
[1:30:39] men that got their own Revelation apart
[1:30:41] from Paul and they left the Apostle Paul
[1:30:43] right that's where Alexander the copper
[1:30:44] Smith is in the household of faith right
[1:30:46] who did Paul much evil that's where Deus
[1:30:48] is right that's another one who left the
[1:30:50] prophet Paul's message that's where
[1:30:52] doctr fees is in the household of faith
[1:30:55] see he's the one who love to have
[1:30:56] preeminence among the Brethren remember
[1:30:58] John writing of him in third John verse
[1:31:00] n right how many knows we got some Sons
[1:31:02] ofct fees read dismiss huh sure we do
[1:31:05] right these are the type of men who
[1:31:07] esteem themselves to be a little bit
[1:31:09] higher a little bit deeper a little bit
[1:31:12] better a little more in tune with the
[1:31:14] spirit than the average preacher and
[1:31:16] granted maybe in some areas they are I
[1:31:18] won't deny that but the point is the but
[1:31:21] but the point is that arrogant
[1:31:23] self-righteous self-promoting Spirit
[1:31:25] should never be on display and ped off
[1:31:27] as a Christlike Spirit exactly amen
[1:31:30] that's right Dr Gil the Bible Expositor
[1:31:32] made this observation he said does means
[1:31:35] nourished by Jo is a Christian mentioned
[1:31:38] in third John 9 he was a gentile there
[1:31:40] was one of his name who was of the king
[1:31:41] of Athens that may confirm this the
[1:31:43] sliding and rejecting Brethren that came
[1:31:45] from Judea is very likely he was more
[1:31:46] than a private member of the church that
[1:31:48] he was an officer and it may be that he
[1:31:50] was the pastor and though there is a
[1:31:53] preeminence which of right belongs to
[1:31:55] such an officer as to provide over the
[1:31:57] church to govern guide direct according
[1:31:59] to the laws of Christ he being set over
[1:32:01] the church as a ruler governor and God
[1:32:03] yet this man may be carried too far as
[1:32:07] it was by this man who coveted more than
[1:32:09] his due and lorded over God's Heritage
[1:32:11] ruled the flock with force and cruelty
[1:32:13] and assert a tyrannical power over them
[1:32:17] we got these guys in the message I just
[1:32:19] had to veto about six names I
[1:32:23] it's here it's here and that's the type
[1:32:26] of spirit we contend with in the message
[1:32:27] church today as well given how
[1:32:29] Despicable and disgraceful these
[1:32:31] pretentious message pastors are that we
[1:32:33] have come that we have come to our
[1:32:35] placing still must love our enemies amen
[1:32:38] amen if they war against us and fight
[1:32:40] against us and do all man of evil
[1:32:43] against us y huh as they did to Paul and
[1:32:46] brother randam and we say that's my
[1:32:48] enemy he's off the word that we're
[1:32:50] obligated to pray for for unless he's
[1:32:52] blasphemed and he probably already has
[1:32:53] but we must love him anyhow am we do not
[1:32:56] have the right to fight back and you
[1:32:58] know well the judge is here and he's in
[1:32:59] me and act all cocky and rude and
[1:33:01] belligerent not at all the judge is here
[1:33:04] that's true but he's but he's here to
[1:33:06] examine your spirit right right the
[1:33:08] spirit of the Bride because she's the
[1:33:09] one who's going to be ruling and judging
[1:33:11] in the not these other birds right right
[1:33:14] see what makes them enemies is their
[1:33:16] hatred to release their attitude toward
[1:33:17] the true bride not our hatred toward
[1:33:19] them because our treat of others is not
[1:33:23] predicated on how they treat us right in
[1:33:25] other words you treat me NE me I'm going
[1:33:27] to treat you me you yell at me I'm going
[1:33:28] to yell back at you you tell a lie on me
[1:33:30] and I'm going to tell a lie back on you
[1:33:31] uh not at all right our treatment of
[1:33:34] others is not predicated on how they
[1:33:36] treat us exct right see that none render
[1:33:38] Paul writes to the Thessalonians that
[1:33:40] either evil for evil but ever follow
[1:33:42] that which is good among yourselves and
[1:33:43] to all men right amen amen see as the
[1:33:46] musicians come I just keep going and
[1:33:47] going the musicians may come what we got
[1:33:50] to do is keep in mind this is a m battle
[1:33:51] this is the greatest battle ever fought
[1:33:54] it's a spiritual warfare we're we're
[1:33:56] involved in right and the weapons of our
[1:33:58] Warfare are what are not carnal But
[1:34:00] Mighty through God pulling down the
[1:34:03] strongholds that's right so that true
[1:34:06] bride Spirit brother sister makes us
[1:34:08] conscious then to love everybody and
[1:34:11] causes us to get along with everybody
[1:34:14] and live at peace with everybody as much
[1:34:16] as lies within us that's right huh is
[1:34:18] that what he said if it be possible as
[1:34:20] much as lie within you possible why
[1:34:22] because we're everyone's enemy outside
[1:34:25] of just if few listen the whole world
[1:34:26] hated Jesus didn't he that's right and
[1:34:28] Jesus said in John 1518 if the world
[1:34:30] hate you and you know it hated me before
[1:34:32] it hated you yeah hey see that's the
[1:34:34] Paradox we we're we're a threat to
[1:34:36] nobody right but yet others are threaten
[1:34:38] threatened by us you say why because of
[1:34:40] our lives our existence our present what
[1:34:42] we stand for what we believe Jesus
[1:34:45] warned it would be this way right he
[1:34:46] absolutely did so hatred and persecution
[1:34:49] are two things that we're told we're
[1:34:50] going to get whether we like it or not
[1:34:52] so we got to get it in our minds and
[1:34:54] that's what this message invites that's
[1:34:56] what it brings to us this message
[1:34:58] invites hatred and mistreatment and
[1:35:00] persecution and we know the great
[1:35:02] persecution is actually just ahead of so
[1:35:03] make a little bit on that on
[1:35:05] Sunday but you just remember he said
[1:35:07] we're just Mystics that's right Mystic
[1:35:09] people ain't going to understand you
[1:35:10] uhuh that's right see misunderstanding
[1:35:12] something we know a lot about if you've
[1:35:13] been in the message more than two days
[1:35:14] you know what misunderstandings all
[1:35:16] about H that's exactly what a Mystic
[1:35:19] means it means mysterious or difficult
[1:35:21] to understand but it also means having a
[1:35:24] Divine meaning that is beyond human
[1:35:27] understanding amen glory to God it means
[1:35:30] having a supernatural or spiritual
[1:35:32] significance of power he was a Mystic to
[1:35:35] them with his perfect faith it ain't
[1:35:36] going to be no difference than us is God
[1:35:39] is maturing and developing growing into
[1:35:41] this full maturity Perfection brother
[1:35:43] sister with this Faith it's going to be
[1:35:45] like brother B said he was a Mystic to
[1:35:47] them with his perfect faith and so it is
[1:35:49] now with those who have perfect faith
[1:35:51] that's we are Mystic to others that's
[1:35:53] right so we have in Jesus an example of
[1:35:56] what life of a Mystic really is right so
[1:35:59] as Mystics they not going to understand
[1:36:00] you they won't be able to figure you out
[1:36:02] right they won't be able to Fathom what
[1:36:04] we believe or what we stand for right
[1:36:06] see the the fact of the matter is is
[1:36:07] just our very presence what we stand for
[1:36:09] is a threat to their way of life and
[1:36:10] their beliefs and their legalism and
[1:36:12] their their Pentecostal ways but listen
[1:36:14] brother said we're just mere sheep we're
[1:36:16] just sheep grazing in the pasture meat
[1:36:18] sheep gentle sheep defens little sheep

[1:39:34] know people say even stickers on the car
[1:39:37] said I'm not perfect I'm just
[1:39:39] forgiven and they don't realize if

[1:39:43] perfect because there's nothing
