[0:00] we have man there's a
[0:03] electricity in the air then kids
[0:06] downstairs they threw me out all the
[0:08] sunscreen classes so that's too big and
[0:09] too old
[0:11] so i left good to be in the house of the
[0:15] lord good to
[0:16] have each and every one of you here
[0:17] we're gonna try to start this
[0:19] and uh and see how it works we don't uh
[0:23] we don't wanna hinder the spirit we
[0:24] don't wanna handle the spirit of worship
[0:27] but we do wanna get back into our sunday
[0:28] school classes i mean the kids are
[0:29] really excited about getting back in the
[0:31] sunday school class amen
[0:33] because we are sheep and we need we have
[0:34] to be led
[0:36] and we need to be led of the lord so if
[0:37] you would turn your bibles if you want
[0:39] to just for a moment
[0:42] to genesis now this is not in the uh
[0:45] what they're going to put up because i
[0:46] want you to read this in your bible
[0:49] genesis 4 verse 26 what we're going to
[0:52] talk today
[0:54] just briefly on prayer i told you we
[0:56] would take one
[0:58] one topic actually take one word
[1:02] and then that word we will use for as
[1:04] many times as we need it
[1:06] to talk about it just in a sunday school
[1:08] class okay
[1:10] so prayer genesis 4 verse 26 it says
[1:14] unto seth and him also there was born a
[1:16] son
[1:17] and he called his name enos then began
[1:20] men
[1:21] to call upon the name of the lord
[1:24] now if you go back in genesis 2
[1:28] 1 2 3 and 4
[1:32] god spoke straight to adam he spoke
[1:35] straight to eve god spoke straight to
[1:39] abel and god spoke directly to cain
[1:42] amen so that was the line of
[1:44] communication
[1:46] because with the way it's going to end
[1:47] up is the way it was in the beginning
[1:49] we're not going to need prayer when we
[1:51] get them to take a body change
[1:53] it's all going to be done and over you
[1:55] won't need prayer prayer is a
[1:56] communication
[1:57] because you can't get directly to god
[2:01] except by prayer and that's what we're
[2:03] going to read here in just a minute
[2:06] but then after the fall in genesis 4
[2:09] they had a son named seth adam and eve
[2:11] did and said then man began to call
[2:14] upon the name of the lord which means
[2:16] they began to pray
[2:18] because they could not get to god
[2:21] like adam and eve and even abel and cain
[2:25] could get to god amen and we can't get
[2:28] to god like
[2:29] adam and eve got to god right
[2:32] i mean he would come and walk in the
[2:34] cool today sure i wish god would appear
[2:36] but now he literally appeared
[2:38] to adam and eve and talk to them person
[2:41] to person
[2:41] back and forth and we know that the
[2:43] bible covers and we may cover a little
[2:45] bit later the bible covers that
[2:47] that moses talked to god lip to ear well
[2:49] now you got to remember
[2:52] he was under the blood of bulls and goes
[2:53] it wasn't the almighty god
[2:55] standing in front of him remember he
[2:58] came as different people like the
[2:59] captain of the host and he came as
[3:01] melchizedek
[3:02] he was veiled in something because you
[3:04] can't see god
[3:05] amen and then moses said i want to see
[3:09] god
[3:10] god showed him the back part of him but
[3:13] he did not show him his face
[3:14] remember because he had to kill him if
[3:17] he showed him his face
[3:18] amen so now let's look at this to pull
[3:20] up the word prayer
[3:22] it's an invocation or an act that seeks
[3:24] to activate a rapport with an
[3:26] object of worship through deliberate
[3:29] communication in other words
[3:31] prayer you you know some people may pray
[3:33] to the devil some people may pray to an
[3:35] idol some people may pray to a building
[3:37] or
[3:38] or whatever but we pray to god we are
[3:41] the only people on the face of the earth
[3:42] that knows who to pray to
[3:44] right all right so it says in the narrow
[3:46] sense the term refers to an act of
[3:48] supplication
[3:50] or intersection intercession directed
[3:53] towards a deity
[3:54] or a deified ancestor well we don't have
[3:57] no deified ancestor we have a
[3:59] daddy named god that's his name is jesus
[4:01] christ so we know who we're praying to
[4:03] but now remember when you look in the
[4:05] bible let's go to genesis 3 18
[4:08] there is when it talks about pray
[4:13] that pray there is not to pray that you
[4:16] pray
[4:16] for an intercession or pray to somebody
[4:19] this is
[4:20] in hebrews the lexicon told us
[4:23] tells us it's a it's an exhortation in
[4:25] other words
[4:26] freda i pray that you'll come to church
[4:28] well now i'm not going to pray
[4:30] but i'm going to bring up the next one
[4:32] he says i pray thee
[4:34] so it's a primitive particle of
[4:36] incitement or entreaty
[4:38] all right so it's not prayer like
[4:40] communication prayer from me to
[4:42] from me to god it's pray now please in
[4:45] other words please
[4:46] please come to church i pray that you'll
[4:48] come to church
[4:49] well you know you're not going to really
[4:50] pray and you're just you're saying a
[4:52] word
[4:53] that says please or an exhortation so
[4:56] you have to keep those two separate
[4:59] believe me there's 480 something
[5:01] references to prayer in the bible and i
[5:02] read every one of them
[5:04] and some of them has nothing to do with
[5:07] prayer to god
[5:08] it's i pray that you'll come i pray that
[5:10] you'll do this
[5:12] amen so now let's go to genesis though
[5:14] this is the first time
[5:16] that the word pray is for an
[5:18] intercession or for a communication to
[5:21] god
[5:22] and look who it happens to it happens to
[5:25] abraham
[5:26] the prophet abraham he has just given
[5:29] his
[5:29] wife away
[5:33] the second time he just gave his wife
[5:36] away
[5:38] and now he's telling them now therefore
[5:40] restore the man his wife he's talking to
[5:42] abimelech which is the
[5:43] the king of that time and he's going to
[5:46] take sarah to be his wife and
[5:48] god's not going to let that happen so he
[5:51] says look now he's talking to abimbly he
[5:53] says now therefore restore the man to
[5:55] his wife for he is a prophet
[5:57] and he shall pray for thee that's the
[5:59] first time in the bible that that word
[6:00] pray means
[6:02] go to the hebrew lexicon
[6:05] is to intervene interpose
[6:09] to mediate to intercede or to pray
[6:13] all right so that's palau pow lao
[6:16] in the greek or hebrew and that
[6:19] is now become the where it comes to
[6:21] abraham which is abraham's what the
[6:23] father of us
[6:24] all the father of faith and what he does
[6:27] is
[6:27] is god right there in genesis 20 verse 7
[6:31] and we'll read that leave it up because
[6:33] look it says in genesis 27 he talks
[6:35] about pray for thee then genesis 2017
[6:38] abraham prayed unto god a prayer of
[6:41] intercession or a prayer of
[6:43] of communication and god healed
[6:45] abimelech and his wife and his
[6:46] maidservants and they bear children
[6:48] because god told the bible and he said
[6:50] if you touch that woman
[6:51] he said i'll close every womb up in
[6:52] egypt and he said i'll destroy your
[6:54] country
[6:55] but he had to have abraham come and pray
[6:58] for him everybody okay with that now
[7:02] let's go to numbers 11 verse 2.
[7:06] so now and the people cried unto moses
[7:08] now this is the first time moses prays a
[7:10] prayer
[7:11] of intercession because listen moses
[7:13] prayed many prayers for these people
[7:15] because they were always needing
[7:17] prayer amen but now remember
[7:21] when we look at this in exodus
[7:26] coming to numbers the people said
[7:30] god because see god was wanting to talk
[7:32] to him like he did in the garden of eden
[7:33] god said bring him to the mountain i'll
[7:36] talk to him lip to ear
[7:38] the people said no we don't want that
[7:39] happen we want somebody to intercede or
[7:42] to pray for us
[7:44] and he they said let moses pray for us
[7:47] and then we'll do whatever he says well
[7:48] they didn't do everything he said
[7:50] but every time they got in trouble moses
[7:52] prayed unto the lord and the fire was
[7:54] quenched
[7:55] so there was a prayer of intercession or
[7:58] mediation
[8:00] and even we're going to get to it a
[8:01] little while we might not get to it
[8:02] today
[8:04] but the bible talks about even when we
[8:07] pray for the sick
[8:09] if you pray an earnest prayer for the
[8:11] sick you can get your sins forgiven
[8:15] amen and if he has any sins they'll be
[8:18] forgiven we'll not get to that today i
[8:20] want to try to get to a spot and then
[8:21] we'll stop
[8:22] because we're going to try to calibrate
[8:23] all this where we can have time and then
[8:25] it won't be rushed
[8:27] but we don't have to do a big long
[8:30] um like a sunday school class we used to
[8:32] do downstairs i'd rather do it just keep
[8:34] this one word of pray because remember
[8:36] one more time
[8:38] we're going to read in psalms 5 verse 1
[8:40] watch this
[8:42] to the chief musician the psalm of david
[8:45] now david was one that could pray
[8:46] because the whole book of psalms is a
[8:48] prayer
[8:49] a prayer of exhortation and get me out
[8:51] of this and i need you
[8:53] and all these things because remember we
[8:56] need prayer brother branham tells us
[9:00] that it's the most powerful weapon
[9:04] but it's temporary remember it's
[9:06] powerful it's the most the only way that
[9:08] we can talk to god because the
[9:10] bible tells us to put pray without
[9:12] ceasing
[9:13] so prayer and intercession is our
[9:16] greatest weapon
[9:18] but it's not going to last though
[9:20] because when we get to
[9:21] now see here we here in in the
[9:24] message of the hour we have people that
[9:27] have superseded that and brought it back
[9:29] to well we're already in the millennium
[9:30] and we already we don't need to pray
[9:33] we're already god made manifest in
[9:34] another form that's what you said
[9:36] brother wade
[9:37] yes we do but you still need prayer
[9:40] right
[9:40] because you still sin every day you
[9:42] still backside every day and the only
[9:44] way to keep from backsliding and sinning
[9:45] is to pray to god he's the only
[9:47] intercessor
[9:48] you don't pray to brother dale you don't
[9:49] pray that william branham
[9:51] you pray to god amen amen and you don't
[9:54] need a picture and you don't need to get
[9:56] into all these different places and
[9:57] positions
[9:58] let's don't be catholics bible tells us
[10:01] pray without ceasing how many times
[10:03] have you went down the road and and
[10:05] something pop up in you
[10:06] in your mind of thinking of somebody and
[10:08] you go god bless the people you know
[10:11] you remember the old saying is the
[10:13] ringing in the air
[10:15] your ear starts ringing you need to
[10:17] start praying for somebody because
[10:18] something's happening that's the bells
[10:20] of heaven
[10:21] going off well you know what sometimes
[10:23] it
[10:24] if it goes off god may want you to pray
[10:28] but when something comes on your heart
[10:30] don't pray that brother dale will pray
[10:32] for your kids
[10:33] because we do that anyway but pray you
[10:36] pray for your kids you can pray
[10:38] as we get all this together we see this
[10:41] intercessory prayer though
[10:44] has been tainted by the catholic church
[10:46] because see you got to pray to a dead
[10:48] saint that prays to god
[10:49] you got to pray to a priest that prays
[10:51] to god you got to pray to the pope that
[10:53] prays to god
[10:55] you don't have to do that not as a
[10:56] christian as a christian you pray
[10:58] straight to god almighty
[10:59] you don't have to go through an angel
[11:01] now god may send an angel to help you
[11:03] right but you're praying to almighty god
[11:06] and you're not praying to a second
[11:07] person of a trinity
[11:08] or a third person of the trinity you're
[11:10] praying to almighty god the creator of
[11:12] heaven and earth
[11:14] hearken unto the voice of my cry my king
[11:16] and my god for unto thee will i pray
[11:19] my voice shall thou hear in the morning
[11:21] o lord in the morning
[11:22] will i direct my prayer unto thee and
[11:24] will look up
[11:27] now god told them we it's later on in
[11:30] here but i want to bring this out
[11:33] you know god told the people
[11:39] that if they'll just look toward the
[11:40] temple and pray
[11:43] jonah look toward the temple and pray if
[11:46] you get in trouble
[11:48] look toward the temple because that was
[11:49] the old testament that's where
[11:51] they knew god was at the time see you
[11:54] and i don't have to pray toward lula
[11:56] georgia
[11:57] we don't have to pray toward
[11:58] jeffersonville
[12:01] uh-uh you pray to god because you know
[12:04] where he is you're the only people
[12:06] in the world that knows where he is
[12:09] amen we know he's in our heart but what
[12:11] does remember in our heart we still have
[12:13] to communicate we still have to pray
[12:15] don't be like the people that
[12:16] are in the message that see how close it
[12:18] is though you come over here and you say
[12:21] well you're saying we're almighty god
[12:23] and we're god in human flesh and we're
[12:25] the bride and we're this and we're that
[12:28] you still need prayer amen because
[12:30] you're still in a sinful condition
[12:31] you're still in a sinful body
[12:33] and you still have memories and
[12:35] conscious effects and imagination to
[12:36] deal with
[12:37] for unto thee will i pray my voice shalt
[12:39] thou hear in the morning o lord in the
[12:41] morning
[12:42] will i direct my prayer unto thee and
[12:44] will look up let's go to proverbs
[12:47] 15 verse 8. the sacrifice of the wicked
[12:51] is an abomination to the lord but the
[12:53] prayer of the
[12:54] upright is his delight
[12:58] wow god delights
[13:01] he loves for you to pray to him he's
[13:04] never too busy we we
[13:06] know that but sometimes we go well maybe
[13:08] i'll pray tomorrow i'll
[13:10] no you need to pray right then because
[13:13] god may want you to pray now truly there
[13:15] is an intercession where you can
[13:16] intercede for someone
[13:18] brother brown said you get to so sick
[13:20] you can't pray for yourself you need
[13:22] somebody to pray for you
[13:23] but it's not that i've got to pray to
[13:25] this one and then it connects to that
[13:26] one and then it connects to this one
[13:28] no you're praying a prayer because
[13:29] you're outside and
[13:31] uh for some of your sisters that have
[13:33] lost your husbands i can't pray for that
[13:34] some of the sisters that have husband
[13:36] but you can you can pray for somebody
[13:38] like sister cathy that just lost her
[13:40] her husband and vice versa the other way
[13:43] we can enter i can't enter in i was
[13:45] there was a guy last saturday he had
[13:48] just lost his wife she was only like 50
[13:50] something years old
[13:51] died suddenly and he comes out to the
[13:54] mailbox and he's telling me about this
[13:58] situation that he was in that his wife
[14:00] just died
[14:01] and he was just you know teared up well
[14:03] see i couldn't and i told him i said
[14:05] buddy i'll pray for you i said but i
[14:06] can't enter into your
[14:08] to your situation because my wife's
[14:10] still alive
[14:12] but god does put us in situations where
[14:14] many times we've seen
[14:16] where if like when sister hazel died
[14:19] brother gary atkins was here
[14:20] brother gary krantz they had lost wives
[14:23] before
[14:24] and they could help or intercede with
[14:27] brother tom
[14:28] and different ones and even went to the
[14:30] hospital with them because they what
[14:32] because they their situation was that
[14:35] they could enter in
[14:36] or intercede and say god i know how that
[14:39] person feels
[14:40] right so see you can tell somebody you
[14:42] pray for them but if somebody says
[14:44] well you know what i mean talking about
[14:46] my wife no i don't know what you mean
[14:47] i've still got mine
[14:49] but i can pray that god will give you
[14:50] comfort because he's the only one who
[14:51] can comfort you
[14:53] amen and we don't question why god does
[14:56] things but we know that there's one
[14:57] thing for sure
[14:59] prayer changes things we'll get into
[15:01] that next sunday not this
[15:02] anymore brother brown says prayer
[15:04] changes things but the prayer of the
[15:05] upright is his delight now let's go to
[15:08] isaiah 56
[15:10] verse 7.
[15:14] even then will i bring to my holy
[15:16] mountain
[15:17] and make them joyful in my house of
[15:19] prayer their burnt offerings and their
[15:21] sacrifices shall be accepted upon my
[15:23] altar
[15:24] now this is the old testament because
[15:25] look
[15:27] for my house shall be called a house of
[15:29] prayer now
[15:30] this is sacrifices this is what they
[15:34] laid on the altar but they still had to
[15:36] pray
[15:37] lay their hands on that sacrifice
[15:40] and say god forgive me in my sins
[15:42] they're not praying to the dead animal
[15:45] they're praying to god but that's the
[15:46] only way they could get to him in the
[15:48] old testament
[15:49] because in new testament now we live
[15:50] under a new testament we're going to
[15:52] talk about
[15:53] this afternoon where now jesus christ is
[15:55] our mediator he is our lamb that died he
[15:58] is the one
[15:58] that we pray to because he's almighty
[16:01] god
[16:02] we don't pray to another person we pray
[16:04] to almighty god
[16:06] so when you talk to god be careful
[16:08] that's who you're talking to
[16:10] for my house shall be called a house of
[16:12] prayer for all the people now jesus
[16:14] refers to this scripture
[16:16] when he drives the thieves out of the or
[16:18] the people that are selling in the
[16:20] temple he drives them out he said
[16:22] my father has made this a house of
[16:24] prayer and you've made it a dent of
[16:25] thieves that's the scripture he's
[16:26] talking about isaiah 56.
[16:29] many times i know we we read through the
[16:31] new testament but
[16:32] most of the time jesus is quoting the
[16:33] old testament because that's how he came
[16:36] under he came under the old testament
[16:37] all right
[16:38] so this shall be called a house of
[16:40] prayer for all people
[16:42] now let's go to daniel 9 verse 20
[16:46] and while i was speaking and praying and
[16:48] confessing my sins and the sins of my
[16:50] people israel
[16:52] and presenting my suffocation before the
[16:54] lord for the holy mountain of my god
[16:56] what happened is daniel opened up his
[16:59] shutters and he did what god said he
[17:01] prayed toward that temple
[17:04] and god heard him because and while i
[17:06] was speaking in prayer
[17:09] even the man gabriel who had seen in the
[17:11] vision at the beginning being caused to
[17:12] fly swiftly touched me about the time of
[17:14] the evening
[17:16] oblation so but now remember this is old
[17:19] testament so he needed gabriel he needed
[17:21] they needed the archangel they needed
[17:23] all these different ones in the old
[17:25] testament
[17:26] but remember you don't pray to gabriel
[17:28] now you don't you pray to jesus christ
[17:31] we know that gabriel was an angel but it
[17:33] was somebody that they were very
[17:34] familiar with because remember gabriel
[17:36] was always the one that brought him a
[17:37] message
[17:39] he brought him he brought a message to
[17:40] him he brought a message to mary
[17:42] amen yet while i was speaking in prayer
[17:47] matthew 5 verse 44. let's get into the
[17:50] new testament just a minute we'll stop
[17:51] right here
[17:54] but i say unto you love your enemies
[17:56] bless them that curse you
[17:58] do good to them that hate you and pray
[18:01] for them
[18:03] which despitefully use you and persecute
[18:05] you how many of you
[18:07] do that i don't want your hands
[18:11] it embarrass all of us
[18:15] brother wade waste time praying for my
[18:17] enemies
[18:19] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[18:21] because that prayer
[18:23] may touch that person that prayer life
[18:26] will help you now watch this in matthew
[18:30] 6
[18:30] 5 and when thou prayest
[18:34] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
[18:38] for they love to pray standing in the
[18:40] synagogues in the corners of the streets
[18:43] that's why that sometimes you hear
[18:45] people and
[18:47] they want to pray louder than the rest
[18:48] of the people or they won't pray longer
[18:50] than the rest of the people
[18:52] listen folks if you're taking up an
[18:53] offer and pray for the offering don't
[18:55] pray for the house and the senate and
[18:57] and you know and and for people in
[18:59] another church you're praying for the
[19:00] offering
[19:02] okay same way with responsive reading
[19:05] and all that
[19:06] pray it's not prayer request time
[19:09] brother terence's prayer request time so
[19:11] you pray for the prayer request
[19:13] you get up here pray the prayer that you
[19:14] need to pray at the time
[19:16] because when do we do most of our
[19:17] earnest praying it's not here in church
[19:21] i thought the prophet said you need to
[19:23] be prayed up before you get here
[19:26] pray it up before you get here not be
[19:29] unfamiliar
[19:30] with prayer before you get here and then
[19:32] practice it in the church
[19:34] that's not what it's not what god's
[19:36] saying
[19:37] all right let's read that again thou
[19:40] shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[19:41] because remember what did jesus do they
[19:43] were standing in the synagogue one day
[19:46] and this one over here was just praying
[19:47] this big loud prayer
[19:49] and this other one i'm just so glad i'm
[19:51] not like that sinner over there and
[19:53] then the guy over here was praying lord
[19:55] i'm sorry forgive me
[19:57] he said which one did my father hear he
[20:00] didn't hear that loud one
[20:02] he heard that guy here because this guy
[20:03] was honest he said i'm praying
[20:06] for me you know a lot of times we need
[20:07] to pray for ourselves
[20:10] we're the first one that needs it oh
[20:12] yeah everybody else has got different
[20:14] needs but you pray that you get yourself
[20:16] out of the way
[20:18] they love to pray standing in the
[20:19] synagogues and in the corners of the
[20:20] street that they may be
[20:22] seen of men verily i say unto you
[20:25] they have their reward now it's not
[20:27] going to be a good one
[20:29] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[20:31] thy closet
[20:32] and thou when thou has shut thy door
[20:36] pray to thy father which is in secret
[20:38] and thy father which seeth in secret
[20:41] shall reward you openly
[20:44] and look it says but when we pray use
[20:46] not vain repetition
[20:48] in other words the same thing over and
[20:50] over again as the heathen do for they
[20:52] think that they shall be heard for their
[20:54] much
[20:55] speaking be be not thou therefore like
[20:59] unto them for your father knoweth what
[21:01] things you have need of before you ask
[21:03] this is my last point right here you say
[21:06] well god already knows
[21:09] god already knows what's going to happen
[21:10] why do we need to pray well
[21:12] he knew two things he knew you weren't
[21:15] going to pray
[21:16] or he knew you were going to pray so by
[21:19] foreign knowledge he had both of them
[21:20] waiting if you
[21:21] he knew if you weren't going to pray
[21:22] this is what she was going to get he
[21:24] knew if you did pray
[21:25] this is what she was going to give we go
[21:27] back to the foreknowledge of god knowing
[21:28] if you
[21:29] you say well we always talk about
[21:31] praying for our kids but we can't save
[21:33] our kids but that prayer of intercession
[21:35] god knows
[21:36] we as brother louise and the different
[21:38] ones and we all we pray earnestly
[21:40] for our children then let god work on
[21:43] that end but he's
[21:44] he's listening to what the fervent
[21:46] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[21:49] so let's finish this right here and then
[21:50] we'll stop musicians come as soon as i
[21:52] get finished reading this
[21:53] and after this manner therefore pray ye
[21:56] and let's all stand and let's
[22:00] say the lord's prayer you ready
[22:04] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[22:07] be thy name
[22:09] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[22:12] earth not on earth
[22:13] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[22:16] day our daily bread
[22:18] and forgive us of our debts as we
[22:20] forgive our debtors
[22:22] and lead us not into temptation but
[22:24] deliver us from evil
[22:26] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[22:29] and the glory
[22:30] forever amen musicians come you may be
[22:33] seated
[22:35] we'll stop right there and we'll start
[22:37] again
[22:39] matthew 21 says in all things whatsoever
[22:42] you shall ask in prayer believing
[22:44] you shall receive it wow what about that
[22:48] whatever you ask in prayer you shall
[22:50] receive it
[22:51] so i've never received anything of i
[22:54] prayed 10 times for my kids i prayed 20
[22:56] years for my kids
[22:58] keep praying keep praying
[23:01] but you know what check yourself first
[23:03] that's right
[23:05] because we're going to get into it a
[23:06] little bit further on down the line that
[23:08] that the bible says if you pray with
[23:11] your hair cut
[23:12] god's not going to hear your prayer it's
[23:14] an abomination
[23:17] that's bible brother brown said he won't
[23:18] hear your prayer for intercept he'll
[23:20] only hear for your prayer for you to
[23:21] forgive you for what you did sisters
[23:23] and brothers be careful because we the
[23:25] same way
[23:26] because we're all feminists in the body
[23:27] of christ amen
[23:29] all right so god bless you they're going
[23:31] to play some some
[23:33] music and then brother joe will come up
[23:36] thank you
