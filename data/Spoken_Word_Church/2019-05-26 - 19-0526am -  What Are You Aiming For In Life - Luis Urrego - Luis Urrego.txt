man let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise we have the victory through the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's change the order of the services brother Luis comes this morning the minister just pulled on the word you know the scripture says he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith amen tune your ears to what the Holy Ghost has for you this morning open the eyes of my heart Lord yes open the eyes of my heart for I want to see you oh Jesus I want to see [Music] open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want you for I want to see to see you high and lifted he's shining the light of your glory so pour out your power in love as we sing holy Oh [Music] you're high and lifted on shining in the light of her glory so pour out your power as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy you and I want to see praise the Lord good morning Saints trust that you all are doing well is that your desire that you want to see him amen want to see him in his word I believe that's what we come here Saints you know we come here amen so that we can get something fellows if Bella messes me back there and she's like remembers telling this hmm I thought maybe I'd forgotten I had the note here amen just before I continue let's just remember sister Monica wanted to mention that at 12:35 her class will be practicing or to at least be here in the sanctuary by that time and Zach black needs to be here as well wherever he's at so make sure you do that praise the Lord because we have youth service this this afternoon Youth youth Sunday amen you love the Lord praise the Lord Jesus amen let's just go to the to the scriptures this this morning and just continue to remember brother Wade and brother Dale is there continue to travel thing brother did Wade he's speaking this morning in Kentucky I believe so I believe it's in Kentucky and also as it was mentioned this morning remember brother Claude and since he's in the hospital also brother Joe solace he messaged me last night and he asked that you remember his family in prayer his sister Gwen's family and prayer that I think hid his uh her aunt which would be his mom's her mom's sister passed away so they're there with the family I think in Tennessee if I'm not if I'm not mistaken so remember them in prayer as well praise the Lord Jesus let's uh let's go to the 1st Corinthians chapter 9 first Corinthians chapter 9 amen st. you know I I believe we come to the house of God amen - you know it's almost like it's almost like you know when you go to a football game if you've ever been to a football game and you see the people you know they're there the players are there and they're not there in a huddle you know but you don't go to the football game to see the football players just to be in a huddle for 30 40 minutes right or for two hours you know you pay you pay a lot of money for a ticket that you that you that you purchase to go see a football game to see your team win right - see not not for them to - to be in a huddle amen and because what what the people want is the results that come out of the huddle you see and so I believe that's what we're here this morning Saints we're here as a team amen we're here in a huddle amen to hear from our coach a man who is the Holy Spirit in this hour amen and and and what the world wants a man wants to see is is that people that have huddled what they planned a man they want to see the results of that amen because Saints let me tell you what the world wants to see a true living Christ living in this hour amen they're tired of the of hypocrisy they're tired of somebody saying something and not living something they meant we want to live the the Word of God sure we make mistakes we fall in and we fall flat on our face but Saints the world wants to see a to live in Christ in this hour the world wants to see somebody really win and you and I are the winners in this hour it's declared in the Word of God amen so let's not just concentrate on just on the huddle everywhere Sunday and every Wednesday we come here and huddle we hear from our coach but then we don't go and do what what we hear you're in our huddle amen praise God if I could just kind of type it that way amen so let's go to first Corinthians chapter 9 I don't know if they have it up and they bring it up first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 starting at verse 24 a man if I want to title this message tonight out oh this morning I just want to title it what are you aiming for in life something something a bit more practical but but maybe maybe maybe it can help you in this hour and I want to I want to aim I want to speak to our younger brothers and sisters and kids and we got graduating seniors coming in and and and and now and some and and so we are all in different stages even if you're an adult that you gotta you need to ask that question what are you aiming for in life what are you aiming at what is your goal in life or are you just driftwood just floating just going with the flow I will you know we don't want to be that way amen so let's let's just let's just read this says I know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be cast away praise the lord you may be seated this this morning actually let's have a word of Prayer sorry about that let's just pray our Heavenly Father we thank you once again Lord for your love mercy and grace and father God as we just open back the pages of your word we ask that you'd bless it to our hearts and Lord help us father God to just get aside so that you may say father God what we need to hear what will help us Lord God to be more like you lord lord bless the brother Dale brother Wade as they're out bring them back home safely Lord this this this coming week and Lord we just commit our service the service into your hands and commit myself into you Lord I'm nothing without you father God but I'm all father God with you in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen praise the Lord you may be seated I also wanted to read the scripture here in Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 Joshua 1 verse 8 says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein every now and then it doesn't say that right the scripture doesn't say that every now and then but it says there in day and night that thou listen listen what the good the goal here is that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein now listen to this for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have not just success but good success amen because there could be bad success as well you could be successful in life rich wealthy there's a lot of rich wealthy people in this life but they have no clue about God that's one type of success but it's an earthly success but the scripture tells us here about good thou shall have good success only if this book of the law or this word does not depart from your mouth and that you meditate on it day and night it's very important Saints amen so so I want to title this message tonight water or this way this this morning I'm still used to just preaching at night I say tonight I'm not used to preaching in Sunday morning so you just bear with me and pray for us amen so this morning I want to title this what are you aiming for in life amen and like I said is this for our younger or younger brothers and sisters and kids and uh but it's for all of us amen because Saints we all have to have a certain goal that we're aiming for in life amen we have to have something that we are we are looking forward to amen because you can't just be here because the Bible says it without without of it without a vision the people perish if you have no vision in life if you have if you don't know what you want to do spiritually and physically because they both tie in together then you don't know where you're going you're just like a piece of wood that's just floating down the river have you ever been to the river and you see a piece of wood just floating down or a piece of trash just kind of floating down not calling you trash but I'm just saying a piece of something just floating down it has it doesn't know where it's going and it kind of hits the banks kind of ricochets back up and then and and and it's just kind of floating back and forth and doesn't it doesn't have a goal they meant I'm afraid a lot of people are living their lives that way even people who say they believe the Word of God they have no no no no end goal no no no no where they want to be in in a year or in two years or in five years or in ten years oh well life is the way it is and things are the way they are so I'm just gonna just just go with the flow and put this thing on cruise control and remember I've always said when you put it on cruise control you're going to fall asleep right whenever you put the the car on cruise control you have a higher tendency of falling asleep because you're not there moving that pedal you're not there you know you're not there holding in the pedal Amen you're not there holding in the gas Amen you're not there doing something they meant to cause the gas to part to to move you forward Amen you're not doing what you're supposed to do a man to make the gas which is the Holy Spirit a man that fire a man to move you forward in this life amen you're just there going with the flow amen but I believe the Bride of Christ is moving in this hour and I believe the Bride of Christ has a goal in this hour amen she's not driftwood she's not she's not just anybody amen just goes with the flow and just goes with a mess she is the Bride of Christ a man who has the mind of Christ amen and who has a goal to be like Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus this is our goal amen that is our goal praise the Lord Jesus amen so here in verse 24 Paul here is talking about in first Corinthians about about a race he brings in he brings sports into into the the arena I guess you could say and he he takes he takes people running in a race and types it with with us as the Bride of Christ running in this race of life amen because there's a lot of people in this it there's over seven billion people in this world everybody is running for this for this this route in this race called life right but there's only going to be one victor in this hour it's not like in schools you know schools nowadays a I heard just I heard I heard somebody say say that they celebrate mediocrity in schools nowadays because the second the second if yours if you get second place and you get just as much metal as the first place does and if you get a third place or even if you come in laughs you still get a medal they didn't always used to be that way amen yeah in God's mind that's not how things are there's only one victor in this hour and that victor is the Bride of Christ amen in this hour praise God you know what since you are a victor in this hour because the scripture says that you are we know what the end of the book says we certainly know that it's not the devil we know that there was not the one that wins it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen it's Christ in you amen that's the winner and this hour amen so why are we so just stuck on our mindset that I'm just going to float through this life just kind of just kind of floating and let's see what happens amen you have do something in order amen to make that scripture to produce that scripture that you are a winner and at the at the end time amen there's a part that you have to do sure God did did his part amen he died for us he made a way for our salvation he sent a prophet in this hour amen right he did everything he could for us now there's a part that you and I must do and that part amen God's not going to force us to just just just do it no that's why I like about God that he's a gentleman he doesn't force himself on you they men he never has we he's given us free moral agency right from the beginning he gave Adam Freeman agency and that with that free more agency we know what happened he made the wrong decision amen and are we making the right decisions in this hour because remember the decisions that you make now will will affect you listen to me young people the decisions that you make now will affect you a year from now the decisions that you make now will affect you two years from now the decision that you make right now whatever you're thinking right now that's what you are and that's what you'll continue to be but that's what the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he whatever you think about right now whatever you're thinking of that's exactly what you are amen we'll get to that later amen so Paul says here Paul's here he's talking about here in an Olympic relay amen because we're all running this race of life praise God and nobody nobody here how many come here then they want to lose when you're when you're playing sports and when you're playing a game or when you play I want to play to lose I can't wait to play that game so that I can lose so that everybody could just point you know just say I'm a loser I can't wait nobody here comes here with that mentality nobody even from a young young a young boy young girl they come here with a mentality that they want to win they want to be a victor they want to that they want to outdo the other one right now that there's a good mentality and having that of being a one and two win there's also the mentality of being too competitive that you get jealous when somebody else wins and somebody else winning and saying you're not in the and you're not in the place that you think that you need to be at and you start getting jealous you start getting that attitude wait a second and start playing a victim becoming that's on you that's not the one who won they did their part you've got to do your part amen you see so nobody here in this world nobody here in this life wants to lose a man I remember I remember I was back partly around 2008 we visited brother Joe's house this is before way before we moved here to Georgia and we were at brother Joe's house and Josiah was very young I remember I remember how old he was but back in 2007-2008 cuz Bella was just born she was just a little baby and I sat down with him I was give this example I sat down with him to play tic-tac-toe I remember we were there in the kitchen floor or right there near the floor I was playing tic-tac-toe with Josiah and and I remember I remember that there was a moment that I said that I looked away I don't remember why I looked away and all of a sudden Josiah puts a little circle in one of the blocks now I knew that he did that and when I looked at LEM when I looked down and I looked at him and I said what's that and he's like now I say that not not to embarrass Josiah but just to say this that as little kids he was he was a small child at the time but he had that desire to win even him he came into this world with that desire to win and nobody here in this world comes in this life to what we want to win amen and this our Saints God has his winners in this our Amen God remember how God has a winner and we know who the winner is amen we know the winner is that's the Bride of Christ praise the Lord are you part of that bride amen are you walking in that word amen praise the Lord Jesus so here in verse 24 it says it says but one receiveth the price amen out of all those running only one is gonna receive the price not five not seven not eight hey man one's gonna receive the price praise the Lord Jesus amen so the scripture continues to say it says so run that ye may obtain amen that's the way we're supposed to run to obtain to win that's the way we're supposed to to live this life amen with a with a mentality that I want to win I want to run this race because I want to lose no I want to run this race because I want to win amen and he's already won for us amen he's already given us the victory he's already paid the price for us he's already amen he's already defeated the devil he already stripped the keys from his from his side and kicked them out like brother branham said kicked him out he's got he's the one who gave us power for over over hell death in the grave so why not take advantage of that why not use that as the as the throttle they managed against the gas to keep you moving amen but we forget about the forgive the things that God has done for us as we move in in this day and this life day by day we work we live we raise our children we come to church we leave church we do it and we forget the benefits that we have in this hour amen that we have the revealed word in this hour the revealed word amen good to see our sister amen praise the Lord the revealed word in this hour amen that's a privilege science yeah that's something that you need to be thankful for sometimes we don't take full advantage of that oh my maybe this is not what you come to hear but hopefully you come here and I leave here today and it quickly put it to practice Amen because that's why I want to say something that you can leave here today and put it to practice right away amen right away and especially for our young people they man I love our young people I have a I care for them and and and young people listen if we didn't care for you Amen we wouldn't first of all we wouldn't be praying for you second of all we wouldn't try to stimulate you and keep you around in atmospheres that will be beneficial to you amen God wants if we want the if we want the best for you how much more God amen how much more your parents oh oh they just my mom and dad they're always just down my throat constantly constantly just they don't leave me alone everything everything everything I do they always criticize you maybe just to think maybe that's God speaking through that and put and look to see if what you're doing goes along with his word because if it's not in the word then why not get spanked huh if it's not in the word than why not Amen get rebuked because God does the same thing to us if you're not in the word if you're not obeying his word if you're not if you're not following his word the way you need to be then you need to be rebuked that's the only way you're going to get life and they meant with little baby when he's born and he's not crying he's not he's not he's not moving he's not doing anything he needs to get that for the plasmic spank and then he starts crying he starts moving right but that was for his benefit I wasn't there hurt the little baby that was to make it live amen and that's what that's why God has placed the fivefold ministry in this hour amen - sometimes a man just do that to us smack us in the face do whatever he needs to be stumped on our toes amen but it'll cause us good to leave here with some life amen that's what we want his life saying us we don't want to be we're gonna be zombies amen so amen so in order to win this race of life amen you must run properly and with a spiritual aim and a goal and a purpose in life amen somebody said one time they men I like I like listening to a man named Earl Nightingale and he said he said one time he said people with goals succeed because they know where they're going just like a boat a ship a man who is docked at a at a at a dock if if the captain has studied where where they're gonna go how long they're gonna is gonna take to get there what what course they need to they need to go through to get there and that everything is aiming to get there everything they they plan everything out they're gonna get there don't you think so but if you don't plan it but let's say the ship just kind of just leaves the dock and just doesn't know where it's going just kind of it's gonna end up in a deserted island somewhere and it's gonna end up in a in the middle of a sinkhole somewhere a black hole somewhere why because it didn't it didn't it didn't have a goal they didn't have a target it didn't have didn't have a plan to to go where they do to be at place where they want to go and you have to have a plan in this our Saints amen you have to know where you're going young people you have to know what you want to do what is it that you wanted out of life first of all you have to have God if you Center everything around God first let me tell you everything else will come out right if you put God first in every single thing whether it's what college I'm going to whether is what what man or what woman I'm gonna marry it where where what I'm gonna even even what I'm gonna wear if you put God first you'll always come out right always if you put the Word of God before you remember David said I always put the Word of God before me I always put the Lord before me is what he said now what does that mean it means putting the word before you saying have letting the word have the preeminence amen when the word has the preeminence in there in your life then it's gonna be able to lead you and guide you into all truth praise the Lord Amen look what brother Branham says here I like cuz he talked about this and that the brothers bring it up faith is our victory he met this man one time and he called him a bomb and and it says here the brother bring it up yeah okay says it reminds me of one time that I don't like to say this word but he was just a bum that came to the door and he said could you give me a sandwich I said certainly would you step in and instead and instead of making him a sandwich I thought I'd fix him something to eat and fixed him up just about what I could around the place and set him down to eat and while he was eating I thought I would speak to him seeing that he was a traveler I said where did you come from he just shrugged his shoulders like a little and said no we're kind of like some people you asked the question huh sometimes you guys you asked little kids a question mm-hmm he just shrugged his shoulders a little and said nowhere I said then where are you going and he stopped eating and looked up at me and said nowhere he looked around and swallowed a big bite see he was only just living for the moment that's why a lot of people they just live for the moment but they have no end goal they don't know what they're gonna be in 10 years they don't know where they want their family to be in 10 years he looked around and swallowed a big bite and he said sir just where my heart where my hat's resting there's where I rest in other words that's where I sleep I said I see I said how long have you been doing this he said oh some 20 years or more with no ambitions to the to to better his self look what he says here but let me tell you something tonight you on you on the in and outside of this building you're going to wind up at a destination one of these days that's going to be in the valley of the shadow of death now let me tell you saying is that that is there's nowhere for you to evade that your that's one destination that you're gonna have to face one day if we're still hearing then we don't go in ever if you're if we don't get to go in the rapture amen you're gonna have to face it one day amen I want I want that if I have to face death amen I want you have to live your life Saints that that live your life in such a way that there'd be able that they'd be able to say such things that you want them to say about you at your funeral what are they gonna say at your funeral or are they just gonna have to make up some things to kind of make things look good you know what are they gonna say about you that was a good man he was a godly man he was a godly father he was a godly husband that was a good woman that was a godly who loved who loved the Lord who feared the Lord that was a good that was a good kid that was a good teenager but you let me say teenagers also pass away little girls and little boys also have to go by the grave you're not exempt from death nobody is what do you want people to say about you amen you're gonna wind up at a destination one of these days that's going to be in the valley of the shadows of death I would advise you at this hour to prepare to meet the God that will have to meet you at that hour you'll either meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or a floating piece of driftwood to go into your final destination so don't you use this life just to drift around and float around and and get a better job and to dress better and to get a new television or a better car life means more than that amen oh that's not me saying that that's brother branham saying you have to have an Angolan for your life amen and I've always they've always stuck to me amen what do you want live your life exactly the way you want people to talk about you at your funeral amen you think about that Saints so some people say some people think that having goals is bad and then that you shouldn't have goals and that you shouldn't plan for life but there's nothing wrong about that you need to do you need to do that amen I may because even the Bible talks about having goals and plans remember when Jesus talked about in in in Luke chapter 14 he said that when a man sits down and counts the cost when he's gonna build the tower he sits down and eats he sees how much it's gonna cost what what the expenses the the out goal what the you know and all these different things he has to sit down and plan it out before he actually starts to build the tower now just build the tower just I haven't planned nothing out which is whatever I can get from Lowe's that's what that's what I'll do you know I have no money left to do that to get you know to get more lumber we're just gonna have to swipe put it on that credit card no plans no what no goals financially not nothing and you say you want to get married some of us I most want to get married and you cannot you're not even in the position to support a wife or support a husband I'm just being real with you all sings you know that's how I am and that's that's I want you to think about these things young people all we're gonna live off of love we just love one another laying in bed and just cuddle up and just that Moochie feeling that you know you know that only goes for just a little while that only lasts for just the well you still have to put food on the table you still have to go and work you still have to go and clean the house you still have to you know you have to do you have to face these things that's life but you know what when we have God a man in life amen then though I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me amen there's nothing that you'll be able to accomplish if you do it through Christ I always put the Lord before you then marriage won't be such a hard thing then life won't be such a hard thing raising children won't be such a hard thing amen amen praise the Lord proverbs 16:6 six through 11 says the scripture here talks about how aunts how they prepare they plan for the wintertime right that was you know so if God was so against planning and having a goal and and and and and doing in Deen these things and he wouldn't put these things in the Bible because he mean he mentions there in that scripture he compares to how a lazy person who doesn't plan ahead is out beaten by an ant how many of us can look at an ads and you see an app that is moving I've never seen an ant stay still I'll never look down on the ground and seen an ant or shaking an ant pile and seen the ants just sitting there let's look up at you well that's how some people are when you preach to them or when the word goes forth okay look up at you and [Laughter] they're not moving nothing nothing's changing in their life they're just sitting there I'm here at church I'm doing what I'm supposed to do saying you got to have more ambitions than that more than more than that there's more to life than just an ant I'll do this more MORE 100 percent of the time for some of us laziness will not take you anywhere you know what Saints you you wanna you wanna you want to get to a point where you want to lose some weight or something like that go talk to the person who's lost weight you want to get to a place where they're financially stable go talk to a person who's financially stable don't go talk to the person who's not financially stable who's got credit card debt of the coming out of his ears and all that kind of stuff or who's who's you know who has who is overweight and they've lost just a few pounds go talk to the person who's lost you know if you want to get to a point where you were of success in life amen see what they're doing amen that's what I recommend for you young people amen and one go to go tell a man you wanna you want to see how a Christian a man huh how brother Dale Amen how he's come to the place where he's at go talk to him reading and starting constantly meditating and look where he's at now look what it's look what it's caused him to be a Amen he didn't get here he didn't get there just just without a plan or just without a end goal he had a goal in mind and his goal was Christ that should be all of our goals amen praise God give him brother Dale his flowers even though he's not here a man I appreciate brother Dale for that amen he paid he paid he paid a lot of that that that that is a lot of work amen to to sacrifice time to study the word not just for himself but because for you and I men to come to a point where he knows that he knows that he knows where he's standing in this word do you know that you know that you're where you're standing in this word or you're just a piece of driftwood easily just moved from one place to another like Paul said we're like the wind you know that carries us from one place to the other you know and this one believes this so I'm gonna just go over here the wind blows again I'm gonna go oh I believe that now then this one believes this and then you go over there do you Saints we have to know exactly what we're standing amen know this word a man is alive and it's it's in you it's well they men praise God amen and then proverbs 21:5 says the thoughts of the diligent tend only to be the plenty the plenteous but of everyone that is hasty only only to want in other words the thoughts of the the thoughts of the diligent the ones that are planning ahead they will come out ahead right Amen now saying I wanna I wanna I want to bring this in here that just because you're planning just because your your your you have a goal doesn't always necessarily mean that you might get there and the reason why is because the Bible says the Lord the God orders the steps of man you might have an end goal but really in reality is God the one who steps your your life who orders your life right now you may be involved in something right now you may be doing something you might have an end goal but in reality God's the one who has the final say-so amen I'll put it like this Saints when I was in school when I was just graduated from high school and that was back in 1999 but I just graduated from high school in started going to college and I thought that I wanted to go in and do photography and graphic arts because I was good at it I took that in school and I was good at it even my teacher my graphic arts teacher told me she was the photography teacher as well she said and you're good you're good I have an eye for photography and and things like that and and I went to this certain school in Greenville South Carolina went there started doing my class I was I was excited I liked thinking man one day I may get to go work for National Geographic the magazine you know oh man that are the awesome you know able to go travel although because I love traveling you know that I love to go travel and I love seeing these exotic spots and and be in dangerous situations be able to take a pictures of of a pygmy in the end or something like that you know and that's what I wanted but then when I got there and started in school for about a week or two three weeks late later I had to take this drawing class with it now I'm not a good I don't draw good all right now that my wife does better at drawing she's good at in Bella and evens oh he's picking it up good really good I'm glad they did cuz I just don't do it well and I had to take this drawing class and we have to have this man come in in the middle of the class some old older man I would say he was older gray hair almost burnt skin because of all the the tanning beds that probably he goes to orange wrinkly skin there in the middle of the classroom in us in like a speedo type of thing a bikini shirtless everything that's all he was in there in the middle of class and I had to sit there and draw this man in a certain position you know and we all had to be there in a minute now I'm seeing this half-naked man in the middle and I'm a Christian I just come into the message at that time I'm like no I can't do this and then what's worse is that in the photography class I was taken they to them you know to people in the world they think that the you know showing nude women and things like that is art but I thought you know I didn't feel comfortable with that and that's what they were showing me show me you know take pictures of nude women and things like that and I had to just quit you know what what I thought was my goal what I thought that's what I wanted to be I had to quickly make a choice and say you know what that's not for me that's not for me because my soul my soul was worth more than just that you know and so I got into because I've always liked computers as well and then I got into web development web designing and started building websites and all those different things and now I am where I'm at probably would not have met my wife probably where would I be if I were to continue with that class and maybe gotten a job at some magazine company and in Los Angeles somewhere or something and never would have met my wife never would have had my children never would have been here God's the one who orders your steps God's the one who has the final say-so amen so you might have a goal in your life that's fine if it's godly go ahead you there's nothing wrong with photography there's nothing wrong with with with drawing and graphic arts but then god they said wait a second I have something better for you matter of fact that just happened to one of my one of my nieces up in Canada she was wanting to go to a certain she's going to college as well she's graduating this year from high school she was going to college like two or three hours away in Waterloo in Ontario she was gonna be sleep over there at a dorm and things like that and the course that she wanted she couldn't get she was a she was capable she had the grades for it everything she was not able to get it she came to she came to us telling us asking us for prayer she feels bad and upset well just a few days later just a few days later I told her I sent her something I said you know God's what is it what is it yeah God's no is not a rejection it's a redirection all right and sometimes his no is not not because he hates you he's just trying to redirect you to a better route amen and so and so now she got a dis offer at the University of Toronto only like 30 minutes 35 minutes from her house in the in exactly what she wanted to be and they're giving her a scholarship to go to the cook to the school way better than what she thought I want to go to Waterloo you know and this was this is much better deal you see so Saints it's always just God knows best all right Amen God know best let me continue amen praise God amen so man town was just Ron ba so so saying you have to have goals and you have these goals but make them out with humility knowing hey wait a second I'm planning this out I'm doing this I'm there but just as James says I'm James chapters four chapter four verse 13 says go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gained in other words I have these plans I'm gonna do this that and the other I'm gonna be in business where as you know now what shall be on the morrow in other words you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow right so it's not it's not it's not a James James here is the Bible says to plan but at the same time James here is bringing out plan with humility plan knowing that that you're open to the fact that God changed my plan if you need to write plan in that way change my course if you need to for what's better for me for my soul because my soul is worth more than just this right plan for me amen that God you can change if you I can change be flexible in other words whereas you know not what shall be under morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away that's what our life is we're here for just a little time so just make the bet the most out of that time amen live your life for God live your life for Christ don't live your life for things don't live your life for for him or don't live your life for her don't live your life for this that or the other a man live your life for Christ so that everything else will come out right amen praise the Lord so it's good to make plans as long as we leave room for God to change our plans his goals take precedence over ours amen we have our Dia's to make our plans but God will ultimately accomplish his sovereign desires amen now look what Paul says here Paul's clear-cut goals his life amen if they could bring Philippians chapter 3 amen remember sayings what is your aim in life what is your aim in life but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ you doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that here's one of his first goals that I may win Christ in other words I count all these things around me these past things that I was involved in I count him as dung you know what dung is it's I don't have to explain it shoo-shoo that I may win Christ and be found in him here's another one of his goals and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith here's another goal of his that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings everything that that that that that Paul was involved in it was for this purposes ultimately is for to win Christ not to be rich not to be not to have a big house in the middle of a Atlanta or or something like that that's fine that's nice but that shouldn't be your end goal or to own some some luxury vehicle or something like that's great I love cars but that shouldn't be your end goal in life that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings and that I may own a Bentley and B doesn't say that right being made comfortable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead yes I believe that's the Brides goal amen to be able to obtain the resurrection of the man not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I am also apprehended of Christ Jesus in other words I want to hold on to what has held on to me amen Christ is the one that's been keeping you in this hour your your where you are thank for mommy and daddy thanks for for for your upbringing but it's ultimately been God you know sometimes we when you when we tell our children when we were sitting down to eat why do we pray for our food you're asked that question because ultimately that food was grown not by mommy and daddy mommy and daddy maybe planted the seed watered it but God was the one who gave the increase God was the one who put those green beans together those carrots together I can't do that neither can you and scientists still to this day don't know how to create a blade of grass but yet grass is out there it's God amen praise God so that's the reason why we we say grace we bless our food we to thank the Lord God for providing through my mom and dad this food that I mean because if you didn't give mommy and daddy the ability to work amen the health to go work then we would not have this food on our table right I'm just trying to be practical with our children they meant that's the reason why we say blessing over the table that's why we say grace amen if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count on myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before man you know that word pol he's reaching for those things which are before a head of him because that's his end goal right I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling God in Christ Jesus a man of God in Christ Jesus amen that's what we should be pressing for Saints is the price is the mark of the price of the mark of the high calling a man we're just trying to move on here amen so Saints you know somebody said one time said people are where they are because that is exactly where they really want to be whether they will admit that or not you are where you are right now because that's where you want to be otherwise you'd be somewhere else you otherwise you'd be you'd be doing something else otherwise you'd be thinking in a different way but sometimes we like to just just kind of cozy up to certain spirits and play the victim card and then and and poor me nobody likes me poor me nobody wants to do this with me nobody wants here oh you know what Saints me nobody here in this church not even brother Dale can force you to get to a point where you are now not even the devil can do it it's your own decision the devil comes and knocks on the door but you're the one who has to open say I'm gonna open up where I'm gonna close devil's not gonna rob me of my happiness Devils not gonna rob me of my of my joy Devils not gonna rob me of my of my fellowship with Christ amen you're the one who decides a few where you're gonna wait and if you like the spirit that you that you live in now you're gonna continue to be in that you just continue to just rub that spirit o spirit I love you and it'll just sit there it won't move then when we play the victim card then that comes the blame game somebody else's fault now my fault it's somebody else's fault that I am where I am you know what the the people that are out protesting out in against the 1% you know back a couple of years ago where they are at where they at now they were upset because people were people you know wealthy people who I believe they didn't get there just by getting there they had end goals they they worked hard you know you sit on saying they didn't just get to become wealthy you know just just so I woke up one day and just there's a pile of money in my living room no they they had an end goal but people were upset at them they're taking all our money and all this kind of stuff and where they're at now you see if you do exactly what they are doing you'd be there too but they want somebody to just Kate or something just for them so that they can be happy you know that's not how life is that's not how life is saying you have a part to play and you only gonna reap what you saw amen as a man thinks in his heart so is he amen that's why Christ said let this mind said let this mind of Christ being you amen remember one part when when when God said at the beginning let there be remember and there was right but before they had to be in his thoughts first right he had to think about it first before I become expressed and whatever is in your thoughts right now if whatever it is that you're thinking about right now whatever it is that you hold hold dear in your heart right now that's the atmosphere that you're gonna correct or create around your life so if you're constantly thinking everybody's against you and you're constantly thinking that everybody's after you and everybody's after trying to do something against you and trying to be trying to that's what you're going to portray because that's what you're thinking about constantly it's in your mind that's why the Bible says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eaten drinks have to thee but his heart is not with thee that's just the law of God amen so this hangs that's what we want to always have this mind of Christ being us how do we get the mind of Christ that's why I read the scripture early to let not this word of God the apart from you day and night but meditate on a day and night and if you don't do that everything else around you is going to hold to your thoughts and everything everybody's against you everybody's after you everybody try to do something against you and that's not it if the mind of Christ was in you if you were constantly feeding on the word feeding on the message feeding on what's preached a man at church amen you wouldn't have room to think these things there won't be no room to think somebody's out against me somebody trying to do harm to me somebody's doing it and nobody doesn't want to do this or that with me Amen see because God's thoughts Amen were the one that his thoughts created an atmosphere created the what the world is that we have right and if the Spirit of Christ is in you amen and you're thinking his thoughts it'll create those exact same atmospheres my goodness what a hard concept to grasp but it's not hard right you reap what you sow Amen praise you know Saints I'll give you this example we got we got a little bit more time just bear with me coming back to that I have this I have this router at my house is a router that where Internet pipes in you know to to the house and gives me Kate Wi-Fi right and I have it set on there to where there's a default way when you connect a device to it there's a default settings that nobody's gonna be just able to access anything YouTube or whatever just just you know that to have an open Internet just I have certain settings that closer and things down and stuff like that and I have to manually go in there and set certain devices when they connect to my Wi-Fi router right to have a certain level of security now maybe some of you some of the older people are like what is he talking about Oh security router what is it that oh yeah the younger people probably know what I'm talking about right one time I had this little Bluetooth light bulb that I bought like just a couple of months ago that I wanted to put outside that I kit was gonna connect to the internet and I could manually turn off the the outside light that light bulb with my phone and and and it have come on on its own at a certain time and turn off at a certain time and stuff like that a complete complete control of it and I for I could not get that thing to connect properly to my router and you know to to connect properly to work properly to make a long story short we waited several months and finally it done to me wait a second I need to go into my router settings and and look for it and set the the the default security mode to just open you know so that it have access to the to the internet and sure enough exactly when I did that the things started working now the problem was locally in my house I thought I had even called the company I got to the point where where I'd called the company and I said hey your bulb isn't working can you please send me a replacement and they were gonna send me a replacement but you know what if I had gotten a replacement it would have done the same thing because the problem was local to my home the problem was in my house amen now you know what I'm going to come becoming Saints the problem sometimes is not elsewhere the problem sometimes it's local to our house the problems sometimes might be you thinking that it's somebody else when in reality it's you that you're your light bulb isn't lighting up you blame everybody else for the person for the state that you're in but really in reality God's trying to say you know what you're the problem change your thoughts change your mindset come to me come to the Lord and I will take care of the rest that you're that you could be the problem you could be the hindrance to the church and not know it I could be the hindrance to the church and not know it oh no I've been in the message for 40 years they can't be me that has nothing to do is the message has to be in you just because you have the message here doesn't mean that the message is here you're just probably just like driftwood going through the motions amen and Saints the way we go if we have children it's the way our children are gonna go they watch us if your children doesn't pay attention in church then they're just sitting there just kind of like oh this is another service you know and things like that is that what you do not paying attention not thinking one thing what am i doing for God you know a preacher or even brother Dale bore the weight anybody won't be able to help you if you don't think that they can help you if you already have in your mind said I'm not listening to this person I'm closing off I'm not you know there's nothing that he can he's not he's not a popular preacher he's not brother Dale he's not brother Wade well then you're not gonna get any benefit and if you only come to church just when brother Dale is here something's wrong with you something's wrong with your experience or when just a popular preacher of famous preachers coming through oh brother jewel comes through the house is packed even on a Wednesday brother Lewis is preaching or somebody else one of the local brothers here is preaching oh and we can miss out that day now I understand Saints um there's some people traveling and stuff like that but you know what things I speak out our experience because I've had that attitude as well before I went on our love loved it when I went to church and it was one of the good ministers old man brother Donny Reagan's preaching and oh man you know brother Bisco oh man not all of them good you know no and then when my pastor was preaching then the Word of God won't be able to help you in life so what is your aim in life Saints what is your aim in life there's a lot of material here that I that I haven't covered but Saints brother Brennan says here no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are those things are respected but jesus said except a man be born again see there's got to be something happen on the inside if you don't that's artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow it can't be artificial it's got to be real and there's only one Avenue that that can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency come into the soul by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said you get it there you are see there's the battlegrounds if you'd only get to that get that started first so whatever you think about that's what you are and that is what you'll become more of if you're still living right now if you're still alive you have an opportunity to have a mindset change the grace of the Lord the mercy of the Lord is is with you change your mindset to the word amen praise God so here's that here's the key to success young people he's the key to success this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success that's the key to not just success but good success stay in the word put the Word of God always before you you know what Saints a lot of people in this life run this running this life like as if they're running on a treadmill they've been on a treadmill you know what a treadmill is sometimes get on the treadmill and we stop again on a treadmill because we don't I don't see results though well we're running on this life on a treadmill but we're not gaining any ground or not you're running you're doing everything you're sweating but man that just doesn't change that that's not that doesn't replace you going outside to run you see you see everything and you know that you're gaining ground you know that at a certain point when I get to a certain point I'll stop right there when I see a certain landmark I'll stop right there but some of us are just running lives on a treadmills and don't know where we're going don't know where we've been don't know what's going on but we're running I'm following the other one where we're not following the leader we're following the follower just following the follower that's all we do in life nice I want to follow the leader and our leader is Christ amen our leader is Christ keep her eyes on remember that story the brother branham told about told about that boy who was in that race and he was he was competing with and though some of them boys were like making fun of him they're like huh you're not gonna win look at the kind of bite that you have I think a puny little thing look at it I got this theory this thing here man I could cost me $1,800 I got this thing man wasn't nicely decked out and everything you know this thing he's like okay we'll see you keep talking I don't keep I'm just gonna I'm here for the race little boy gets on the bike starts running the race goes on here they go mm-hmm like the tour of the Front's and you know what Saints everybody else started falling out they couldn't make it but that one boy made it and then they asked him he's the one who ended up winning the race and they asked him did you win the race you you have you don't have the good bike like everybody else you don't have they said I just kept my mind towards my eyes towards the goal the whole time and if we keep our eyes set on Christ the whole time you're gonna come out to be like Christ Saints you're not gonna come out to be like LeBron James you think you're gonna come out to be like LeBron James if you keep your mind on Christ I don't want to be like LeBron James you think you could come out to be like like like a certain movie star or a certain pop singer you know I mean the vato or whatever their their name is Justin Bieber and all these different if you keep your mind on Christ you think that's what you're gonna be like no because if you have set your mind to be like Christ you're not gonna want to be like the rest of the world amen you're gonna come to out to be like Christ so Saints what is your aim in life what are you aiming for in life because whatever you aim for that's what you'll hit whatever you aim for that's what you'll hit have a plan in your life physically spiritually have goals in your life amen because remember people that doesn't have a goal people without a goal people without a vision they'll perish the Bible says that amen you love the Lord praise the Lord it was a lot more here that I had that I could say maybe there'll be a part to another time but but uh I want you all to think on these things now let me let me finish it with this with this quote I wanted to read they have it up it's the one I didn't number them let's see here okay it's the one that says faith is our victory now there's so many people all right down here now there's so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of a purpose in life especially in this day that we now live people just seem to think that all they have to do is to keep up with somebody else with the fashion of the world and with the enticements that the world has given to them just like this if you go to school and some of the little girls wear a certain little frock or a dress or whatever you would call it all the ambition the rest of the school has its to pattern after that girl some of the women's see on the television some certain lady come out and dressed in a certain fashion well that's their ambition is to dress and to act like that and that seems to be just about the limit of the American ambition is to get a new job or to get a raise in your salary and to get a television or a new car let me say this those things may be all right but there's higher ambitions in the human life than those things and Christians should set their affection on higher ambitions I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here in the first place and ever who was kind enough to bring us here which is God we ought to consider it and ask him what he would have us to do then the the purpose of us coming to fulfill what he has purposed for us but we seem to be just wanting to keep up with the world now the Bible said that we could overcome the world and how do we do it not by keeping up with the fashions of the world but the Bible said that faith is the victory that overcomes the world amen now I can give you that quote if you wanted but I think that's very that's very appropriate for all of us what is your aim in life amen let's stand to our feet as how the musicians come let's just sing that song just to be like Jesus but just to be like Jesus amen praise the Lord you love the Lord did you have your toast stomped on I stomp on my toes whenever I'm studying yeah yeah because listen you have to look at this things yourself and be convicted yourself and say wait a second I'm not Lord help me in this area before I can you know you can actually say it to the people the Saints I don't say these things out of hate despite or anything else I say it out of love because I want the best for you especially young people I want the best for you I want you you're our future if there is a future left to be here there's any more any more years for us to be here you're all we have I'm getting you know I'm getting older on the you know I'm not as old as some of you but I'm getting older I'm I'm gonna I'm not gonna be able to be there you know forever and I need some of you young people to be spiritually minded to take this word continue to take this word amen because that's what that's what matters is this word nothing else in this life matters but what we do for Christ or what we do for others that's the only things that we're gonna take in this life oh you feel so good when you've gotten a certain little toy or a certain little gadget or a brand new car or something like that that that just makes you feel so good it gives you that that that dose of dopamine you know for for just a little while that doesn't last but man it feels so wonderful when you live your life for others when you when you when you when you do something for someone when you live when you sacrifice yourself for someone and you're taking the Word of God and saying Lord I'm doing this because the Bible says do it as unto the Lord oh my that that gives me eternal dopa me hey man that's that's what I was let's just sing that just to be like Jesus do to be like chief you have a need of prayer we're more than welcome to come pray pray with you [Music] to be like all through
