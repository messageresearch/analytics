and everything else Fades away glad to be in the house of the Lord again that service that sermon this morning was just a masterpiece I sure appreciate um the word of the Lord that my brother brought um [Applause] and uh I was kind of thinking you know how how sometimes oddly things kind of fit together but you know uh he was he was he was speaking about um this this common idea among the message that you come to you come with eternal life already in you this afternoon I'm going to talk about how to get eternal life and you know you think about uh how why did why would brother Brandon preach messages like the impersonation of Christianity and things if you come with eternal life already in you but now now that is that is a Doctrine out there people you know people sometimes they get a little bit skeptical or do you really know but listen I I some of the minister Brothers know I sat down with um some a brother I will say and uh you know talk to him first you know I I liked it I like to pick people out and just you know talk to them and and that what they believe is is that you come with eternal life already in you and the new birth is when you just recognize that it was already there now come on now I I remember I remember being lost I remember I remember when there was something wrong with me but this afternoon I want to take a little a little scripture from Ezekiel chapter 11. and just talk to you about the spirit of the Lord if you'll turn over to Ezekiel chapter 11 and they'll pull it up as well Lord God we're so grateful for the truth in this hour so grateful Lord for for men of God who will who could who can who can bring your truth and are not afraid to Proclaim it I'm so grateful Lord to be gathered together that this afternoon Lord Jesus in this place Lord and we're no Lord that your spirit is here because you promised it in your word that where the twos and the threes would be gathered that you would the angels of God will be attempt around about them Lord Jesus and so many other promises that we have in your word that if two or three would agree concerning anything that you would do it and so many promises Lord that give us comfort that you're with us and Lord maybe maybe this right now Lord as we gather together maybe we can't feel anything or see anything visible with our eyes but yet we know that you're with us we know that you're here Lord Jesus we know Lord God because you've sent your promises and you manifested them to us Lord and we ask Lord as as I preach these words Lord Jesus said it won't just be some kind of an intellectual something from my mind or from from my knowledge Lord Jesus or even from the listeners Lord from their knowledge Lord but the spirit of the Lord will come and Quicken it Lord that you'll give me utterance Lord Jesus that you'll open these things to The Listener Lord that they'll have understanding of what's being spoken of Lord because truly without the spirit of the Lord that's the only thing that can put things together that can put the word together Lord Jesus that can make it so that we can understand it and make it so that it's lived and Lord we ask Lord that you're just blessing out of service and Lord feel it Liberty to move Among Us this afternoon because surely Lord is the prayer requests have gone forth there's many needs Among Us Lord there's many need but yet Lord as thy brother was testifying you're here Lord God to make your promises real we've seen your healing touch Lord Jesus we've seen your power and move among us and you're yet the same today we thank you Lord Jesus and that's this blessing upon your word in your name and Ezekiel chapter 11 says in verse 16. therefore say thus saith the Lord God although I have cast them far off among the Heathen and although I have scattered them among the countries yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come therefore say thus saith the Lord God I will either even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the country where you have been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the Abominations thereof from things now here's the main point that I want to speak to you about and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and we'll give them a heart of Flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and I will be their God you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you think about what a great promise that is to be able to walk in the statutes of the Lord to be able to have understanding of what we're reading about and to be able to walk in this word from beginning to end and keep mind ordinances and do them there is no way to do that as we were speaking of just briefly in Sunday school there's no way to do that outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of the spirit of the Lord coming and quickening the word in your heart and making it live there's no way to keep his statutes now a lot of times people they they think that they can do it or or they try to they come to church and you know you you hear the gospel preaching you think well I you hear the things that are said I need to be a good person I need to be you know all these different things and and what that makes is sometimes sometimes you'll start acting like it and so we don't want to be actors and that's kind of what I'm gonna be speaking about this afternoon we want to be something genuine we don't want to just hear hear about the law and about the doings and the things that you've got to do about how you got to pay tithes and you got to do works and you got to do do be a good person and love one another and all those kind of things and you try to manufacture it but we want it to be real genuine and you see it it ain't going to be genuine it's not going to be genuine without the spirit of the lord we need the Holy Ghost to do the that but there's a promise in the Bible to be able to walk in God's statues to keep his ordinances and do them and to be his people I think I think you know as the gospel Goes Forth as the message Goes Forth you think what God is doing is he's he's actually drawing you through the through the preaching of the Gospel you can have access to these promises you can have access to they're laying there in the in the pages of this Bible that you can have access to and you hear the gospel being preached and it's pulling you it's drawing you oh you see with the gospel is not the gospel is not somebody forcing you it's not God forcing you through a tube it's not a minister forcing you to come to church it's not somebody grabbing you by the nape of the neck and dragging you to the watering hole and say and drink but it's what it is is God drawing you and God pulling you you this is the this is the greatest sales pitch of all time the greatest sales speech that if you're coming to me Jesus said come unto me all you are weary and I'll give you rest that I'll take you in Labor that Jesus is willing to take all of your burdens if you'll just yoke yourself up with him yoke yourself up with him and he'll carry all the burdens he'll pull the load for you he'll carry all the all the I'm talking about all the Strife of Life all the problems where you you think that God you think your children maybe you're beyond being saved cast that on God and let him bear that burden you think that your boss is being too mean for you and unfair with you at work if you throw that over on God God will take care of it that's the greatest sales pitch of all time that we got a God who wants to carry all of your burdens so with that kind of a gospel God is jaw and you he's pulling you he's saying come unto me come that that's why there's three pools not three pushes he's pulling you he's drawing you to himself he's jawing you into this further relationship with with him he's drawing you to the holy of holies he said if I'll be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me I'll draw I'll pull you I won't push you into it that's why even brother Brown preached that message of deep call into the deep that like David said the Deep with a deep water spouse and so forth as a deep that's calling you this jaw unto you the Lord's army is a army of volunteers not a army of voluntol but an army of people that God has drawn to himself and they responded they opened up the doors of his heart of their heart and so that's this afternoon if you've never opened up the door of your heart to God I invite you I implore you to open up and let him come in so that you can reap these benefits so that you can reap all of the promises that are laying here for you now brother Jesus said in Matthew chapter 4 he said he talked about um he said in Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting the dead into the sea for they were Fishers and he saith unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of me and now Peter didn't know what he was talking about but what Jesus was talking about is is he's going to teach him along and Along by and by a process he's going to instruct him through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all the things that lessons of life that Peter would go through how to catch men now see that's what we're doing when we're when we're preaching the gospel we're throwing the net out and when you when you cast in it when you go to the to the to the ocean and you throw a net out you're going to get that's what one thing I don't like about fishing in the ocean is you never know what you're going to get back you pull up I've seen people pull up a big old eel that'll wrap around somebody's arm and pull up all kind of strange Critters and stuff but you know you're going to catch fish too you see the gospel net is going to come back with all kinds of things and and in Matthew Chapter 13 it said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to Shore and sat down and gathered the good in the vessels but cast the bad away so shall it be at the end of the world the Angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth now brother Brandon when he preached the message the impersonation of Christianity he used all the examples to show that we're just preaching that we're just throwing the net out that God is going to do the sword God is going to do the separating we're just preaching the gospel and tossing out the net to see what comes in a service the service are like should we pull they ask Jesus should we pull everything up yeah pull it all up and Jesus told him in Matthew 13 He said look both grow into the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn God is able to sort it out God is able to feel Believers with the somebody that'll open the door to their heart to their heart God is able to fill them with the Holy Ghost God is able to sort out the net God is able to put it together so this afternoon I'm not I'm not here to pull up I'm not poor here to pull up the wheat and the tears I'm not here to pull something up but I'm here to preach the gospel and see who responds I'm issuing an invitation I miss you in an invitation if you'll if you'll open up the door of your heart God will feel it God will feel every fiber of your being with the Holy Ghost that's the promise that we got laying here and you say oh oh thank God for the truth thank God for the truth like we heard this morning thank God for the truth that will be laid out thank God thank God for the spirit that can Quicken that truth but you know we need a balance of both of those things I think the the church world has been struggling with a right kind of a balance for years you know that's one thing I was I was kind of to talk kind of privately with some of the ministers about you know you go around and you see that lack of balance amongst amongst the ministry you see and like like brother Louise was talking about this morning you go some places and they're they're so labor and heavily on the word and they're like let's maybe it was Ronnie long there's so many there's so many preachers preaching lately you you go some places and they sort of Labor and heavily on the word word and they almost they put the spirit out and they say well we don't need the spirit anymore but you got to have the spirit otherwise otherwise you're just going to be an actor otherwise you're just going to say well I know all all the facts so I'm just going to act it out I'm going to try within my own self to do it I'm gonna well I know what I'm supposed to do so it's late the instru I can read the instruction manual so I know what I'm supposed to be doing so I'm just going to try to try to try to fake it but you've got to have the spirit of the Lord you've got to have the spirit moving in the church you've got to have the spirit moving in your life and let me tell you I loved when you when you talk to some of the young people and they they say things like oh I feel like God is just separate me from the world I feel like God's moving that that is some somebody where the spirit is actually moving in their life and doing something that see God don't want us to be all drawed up and formal and everything well we know all the facts and we're trying to be an impersonator we're trying to be an actor but he wants to be a real genuine Holy Ghost Field Church Holy Ghost spilled people nah now see y'all sometimes sometimes it sounds like ministers complaining about the the the way that the church world is the way people are and the message but brother Brown you go back and listen to the way he preached the impersonation of Christianity this brother this preacher brother came up to him and and started having this conversation with him about the state of Christianity now listen to what he said brother Brown about two years ago I thought maybe the Lord had called me to the United States for work he said I went to the West Coast and got connected with a certain broadcast that goes National and he said well I seen the dishonesty of the way they misused the finance that was sent in he said I just as a Christian couldn't stay there any longer I left and I got hooked up with another and said it was out of the frying pan Into the Fire he thought he'd got out of that mess and he got into something worse and he said I then I just kept and found out so many things and said to find the weakness of the American Pulpit he got to a place where he did he was looking for something genuine he was looking for somebody that was really filled with a genuine Holy Ghost and brother Brown said he said I said brother that is true we have no middle class to speak here of he's talking about a middle ground a balance we either have the real cold and formal and indifferent real cold and informal and different you got you got the letter on the page and you just kind of get cold you feel like nothing is going on in church because your spiritual life has gotten cold and you you don't see anything really happening and you think well nothing's happening and so you get real cold and indifferent and you start thinking well we don't need no more Spirit of the Lord moving amongst us and he said or the extreme you get all the extreme fanatic on the other hand you get so far into the extremes that you're you you're running up on stage saying that that oil is dripping out of my hands and standing up in the middle of the congregation speaking in tongues out of order and all this kind of thing going into fanatical oh if we we need a balance and he said I I said it's too bad and he said then I come here and he said brother Brown as soon as I got here and my first message I found out it was beating the piano and turning over the chairs and he said then I began to wonder and he said through it all I tried to preach the gospel just in the word and when it did he said there was something another that after a while the Lord let me break through to the anointing and brought the Holy Spirit came into our midst with a love and a peace of God began to flow over the building and said then I said now the holy spirit is here and we will now Worship the Lord and concentrate Our Lives unto God and said some young boy with not enough wisdom to hardly get in the door runs up to the pulpit he said amen preacher that's right look oil's been dripping out of my hands all morning Hallelujah let people come up here and I'll give this anointed oil for healing so they run off into Fanatics and if you go read that story further he said the people in the church set that brother down because he got too carried away he said brother Brown I'm heading for Saskatoon to get out of this nest of evil spirits and I said that is true the American Social intellectual group has become so against the other now listen you you think about that this is happening today in the message and I'm not just trying to be critical it's like you open up your eyes go around and you can see it happening so social intellectual group is so against the other group and the other group is so against the other I tell the true the true middle of the road gospel is hard to find a place of approach it's hard to find a place of approach and to get a preeminence and down the road I said Lord how true that is and how hard that it's been to try to get the true gospel to the people pulling from both sides and trying to hold in the middle of the road as we've contended from that since the hour of the Cornerstone was laid see I said what about these Americans down here what will happen to them it seemed like something said or just spoke to me and said what are you doing what is this to thee follow thou me now that's a lesson I think we could all learn when you get to looking around at all the things that seem to be like they're going wrong you look at sometimes we set our eye on somebody that we think is really got it figured out and then they'll slide off and go off into something but if we'll keep if we can go past the naysayers and go past the critics and just keep our Eye On Christ and keep walking in the balance and what is the balance the balance is I need the word but I need the spirit too I need the word I need to know the fundamentals I need to know but I don't want to be an actor I want the spirit of the Living God moving in my life so that I ain't an actor so it's something real and genuine I don't want to act like I love somebody but I want to really love somebody I don't want to act like I can forgive you but I want to really be able to forgive you I don't want to act like I know what I'm talking about but I really want to have a true revelation of Jesus Christ oh there's so much faults out there there's so much fake out there but there is a real genuine baptism in the Holy Ghost there is a real Spirit of the Living God moving in the church listen as much as you might want to go to sleep this afternoon as much as you might be getting cold and dried up in your heart I'm here to declare you that there is still real that they're still realist willing to come and take over your life if you're willing to open him up you open yourself up dude listen now this afternoon you might not ever raised your hand in your life you might not ever clap you might not ever say that men but yet there's still a God that's drawn this the net is still being cast and God wants you to come to him he's drawing and he's cooling like that Dove that brother talked about he's drawing like that deep color through the Deep now you think you think about what Ezekiel was talking about Ezekiel back there when everybody was unable everybody was unable to receive the new birth he's talking about something that he was not able to attain and brother I'm liking it to uh like a prophet it would be lifted up over the fence up over up into time where he could look back and forward and see see the word that was going to be placed that was going to come in each age and he looked forward to see that one day there's coming to people that God God is going to be able to soften up their heart he's going to be able to take out the unclean Spirit he's going to be able to give his own Spirit into their life and they're going to be able to live live this gospel live this word that the Old Testament they had only grasped it in the Old Testament they had only pondered it how can I live according to the law this set of requirements but God has given us an answer in this day God has given the baptism in the Holy Ghost to us if you can only receive it so brother Adam said Ezekiel was prophesying or for telling what would take place in an age to come not in his age so God had took Ezekiel High far up and let him see around about 2600 years think of it then the word that God has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is the the prophet catches what God has already said oh do you realize what you're doing here this afternoon as you if you receive the word you receive what was spoken before the foundation of the world like brother Louise was talking about this morning that God knew before the foundation of the world that he was going to come and die on the cross he knew that there was going to be a word in this age and if you receive this word you receive in what Ezekiel Saw but way back there when he got lifted up the pier down into this age and see that there would be a baptism the Holy Ghost for you to receive he said for the word was before the foundation of the world God spoke the word and is laying way outstretched out in time and the prophet goes up and sees the time coming the prophet goes up and sees the time coming what time he's he's looking at this time he's looking at the day of Pentecost he's looking at seven Church ages he's looking at you sitting here in this building needing something needing an answer from God needed something that God is willing to provide if you can just receive it it's laying way out stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and sees the time coming so it's only a gift of knowledge that he brings down and puts it on the paper now Ezekiel the prophet goes up and sees the day that we're living in he's looking at there's a coming there's coming a day when what there's going to be a Stony heart antidote that's going to be an antidote for this Tony harp oh maybe this morning if you've got a Stony heart where your heart is all dried up and it's it's so frozen solid there hardly anything your mom and daddy can't touch it and nobody else can touch it you don't want to hear nothing but yet there's a there's a Stony hard antidote that's laying here and you were in the word he said the last 2 000 years he had no way of entering that heart because it was sinful and there was only the atonement of blood speaking of ezekiel's day it was only the atonement of blood of an animal laying between that Stony heart and the Creator but when the Christ came and died Christ made a way to take that old cold Stony heart away and the weather brother around say a Stony heart was a Stony heart is the heart of man that thinks they know more than God does you try to witness to somebody and they think well I I know I they try to put together with their own intellectual reasoning and they'll talk you around and around in circles like that Indian Death March that brother around talked about how you know you get lost in the woods and around and around and around you go in circles they get stuck in a loop a Stony heart is somebody that's indifferent you can tell them you're going to be lost and going to hell with that Stony heart is frozen they they don't care but you see you see what the gospel does the gospel of prick that Stony heart and begin to soften it up that Stony heart the heart of the world where you love the things of the world because the love of the father is not even in you so you love you love going out and drinking alcohol and you love smoking that weed you love all those kind of things you love and what it is you're you're a hypocrite you're a hypocrite an actor because you're trying you're trying to do what you think is right and you're just faking it like the Pharisees that come to Jesus and say good Master we would see a sign from thee to prove that you are what you said talk about good Master they they didn't think he was a good Master they didn't think he was good anything and Jesus knew what they were thinking about him all they did they come act trying to act something out brother Rhino said sometimes God can deal with an animal who can't act for itself before he can get to a Stony heart who is on a free moral agency sometimes God can deal with a dog or an animal because he can speak to the birds and tell him you need to migrate this is a time of migration my wife was telling me this is this weekend I think was a big migratory pattern where all these birds are supposed to migrate she likes Birds a lot and so God can just move on those birds and they'll obey him but you talk about you try to talk to somebody that's got a Stony heart and they don't want to hear it a a a cow or will move away from the fence When A hurricane's coming but somebody with a Stony heart you just can't get through to him but the spirit of the Living God can let me preach you a little bit this is why I love what brother Aaron was talking about Wednesday night you get you get desperate parents and you begin to pray for your children and the spirit of the Living God can begin to do something listen I I know I know sometimes we're not supposed to testify when we're preaching but let me break a few rules here one night I got desperate and I began to call out to God and I begin to pray I was praying for Zach this was back when he was not living right and I was praying for God and I began to break through and I felt like that God was beginning to speak through me and it wasn't 30 minutes after I had finished praying and Zach stumbled through the bedroom door and said I need the Holy Ghost and listen I think sometimes you don't realize what power you've got if you get desperate and begin to call out to God something will begin to move do you realize what power is laying in your lips why Christ speak it's time for the church to speak I can't tell you how many times when you get desperate and you begin to call upon God and God begins to move and the steel of the night when you get into your prayer chamber along with God and you begin to move into an atmosphere it's not you praying but it's God speaking God will move on the scene let me encourage you this afternoon Church encourage you not to rely on others but to rely on your own faith in the Living God to know that God has given you something and you can use it he's given his word into your mouth he's giving you his word in your lips and you have the ability to put it to work brother mom said people's got so cold-hearted they can't even shed a tear no more they just become so indifferent it's the spirit of the age we're at the end time when men's Hearts failing perplexed a Time natural affection is gone from people the love of God seems to pull away all I I wonder sometimes if I could just take a picture and share with you what I see while I'm preaching sometimes up here you'll see you'll see young people with tears coming down out of their eyes you see people with it that moved by the spirit and then you'll see others whether whether they just look like they're unmoved they don't really care what they're preaching and they begin to slowly fall into Slumber and head leans up against the wall and they don't really care but yeah see that is being cast I don't care what's in the net all all I care about is preaching the gospel somebody's gonna respond and God's after the feast God's after those rainbow trout that are going to respond to the gospel call oh you see you see sometimes while Miniatures get kind of get they get kind of caught up in what they see because it seems like everybody's so indifferent it seems like people can't be touched anymore but there are some that are still being touched there are some that God is able to soften up their heart brother said you could not go to heaven without the blood of the Lord Jesus no matter how good you are it's only self-made righteousness when you try to act with your Stony heart and you're you're made up religion with what you think God requires we don't go to heaven on self-made righteousness no matter how good you are it's totally impossible for you to get to heaven on your goodness it's totally impossible for you to get to heaven on your goodness totally impossible for you to get to heaven on your own Works what kind of a greater sales pitch could there be than that come unto me all ye that are labor all you that are labor and under your own Works labor and under your own efforts and I will give you rest you know how to soften up a Stony heart present something real to us maybe that's a lesson for us parents you want to soften up a Stony heart your kids coming around and their hearts all Stony let them see something real let them hear The Echoes of Mom and Daddy's prayers when they come in the door let them hear The Echoes of brother Brown's voice when they come in the door let them not see Mom and Daddy uh arguing and screaming each other throwing their hands back and screaming until the veins pop out let them not see the TV playing in players but let them see a genuine Holy Ghost Field House I I remember I want I'll just share this Monica when she was growing up she she'd go over the uh to the Tim Pruitt's house over there in Louisiana and she said I knew that that was a Christian home you go into that home and you knew that that man was a was a real Christian how about us how can we say wouldn't you want somebody to have that testimony about you I sure would like somebody to have that testimony about me when I come to when I come to brother Bob's house now you sure of course you have to make up your mind whether that's true or not but when you go to somebody's house to walk in the door and see this is a real Christian home why because the world is after something genuine the world is out they want to see something genuine or real and there is a genuine there's a real Holy Ghost Field believer out there and that's what will soften up a heart a stolen heart whether I'm told a story of that man uh Bert that uh he said he said I never seen a man so cold-hearted in my life and he went he'd go hunting with a brother Brown and he said he'd kill phones just to make me feel bad and yet of course brother Brown explained you know there's nothing wrong with killing a phone it's you know Abraham killed a calf there's nothing wrong with that but to do it just because he knew it bothered brother Brown to see it bothered brother random to see him just killing him for sport just one after the other and yet he'd do it anyway and that man's heart was so stone cold so Stony until it he just he wanted to see brother Brown a prophet of God suffer as he shot a phone now some of us how many of us would look at that situation and say well he's too far gone he's too far gone but you see the Nets got to be cast because we don't know but we don't know I don't know all I know is that the gospel is available for who's whoever will whosoever will let him come I don't know your heart but God knows it this afternoon and brother Brown said he took that little whistle and he and he blew it because the the deer to come out and that little Fawn was there and he said that's just to my surprise that's across the opening a great big beautiful doe stood up and he and he blew that whistle and they and the doe saw him but yet the doe well bro what did Brother Brown say the quality of that dough was real he saw something genuine he said she wasn't a hypocrite That Dope wasn't no hypocrite she wasn't putting that on she was real she was born something in her was a mother and a baby was in trouble and she was a mother the Instinct in her mother instinct would walk right in the face of that gun knowing that she was going to her death what difference did it make she was going to find that baby it was in trouble she wasn't putting nothing on he saw something so genuine in that little mother deer that she was willing to die for that baby she knew that man was danger but she was willing to die for that and when he started to raise his head up well that's the backwards quote he said well I'm going back in in my quote so I'll skip over that one he said now that mother walking right out not a hypocrite not putting on like a lot of church members do act like they're Christians when The Showdown comes they're ashamed of it she walked out right out there with something real she stood there and was ready to meet her death because of what inside of her she was a mother and a baby was in trouble he threw his arms around my trouser legs and said Billy I've had enough of it lead me to that Lord Jesus that you're talking about now you see you see when you whenever whenever somebody that's got a soft heart when they see something Stony heart when they see something genuine it starts to change him I was talking to the brother I'm trying not to like name names but uh you can figure it out they just preached here and and he was talking about going over to Africa and he said when the people see something genuine when they see something genuine then they give their whole heart to it when they see what genuine the spirit of the Lord move people beginning to receive their Deliverance God moving amongst the the the the the people God moving moving through the building and he said brother Brown said the world tonight is looking for something genuine the people of this nation of the rest of the world is looking to the church for something genuine science has brought us death Society has brought us corruption Church organizations brought us fusses the people want something real when they see that display they're ready God's got it we talk about a god where is he there is a genuine baptism a holy ghost oh I think that should that should inform the how we How We Do Everything how we live our lives at work how we live our lives in front of our children because the whole world is looking for something genuine and brother Adam said if we only need now listen to this quote y'all before you fall asleep before you go into the arms of Morpheus if you if we only need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the Holy Spirit now listen now if we only need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the Holy Spirit if the church is to be run and governed upon the intellects the educational program and upon the intellects of mankind we don't need the Holy Spirit and if it's to be run by the Holy Spirit we don't need the intellectuals it's either one or the other now this is what brother Brown is saying so he's saying we don't need we don't need a made-up fake trying to do it your own self by your own Works what you think is right and wrong why you think the scripture fits together we don't need that what we need is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost a genuine baptism the Holy Ghost of the church and ourselves and a house and sometimes when I'm in prayer I Lay My Hands on the wall of my house and I say God sanctify every wall in this home because I want my home filled with the baptism my Holy Ghost I want my life filled with the Holy Ghost because it's what the whole the Holy Ghost is what we need the spirit of the Living God is what you need the spirit of the Living God is what powers the church it's what powers your life it's what power you're thinking it's what puts all the scripture together that's what you need now you think about the thing about the difference between all these people in the scripture that we can look at as role models that weren't relying on the spirit of God to rule their life look how much better a man Esau was in Jacob but he didn't have the conception to know he had sold his Birthright Esau was a great mother he was so much better man than Jacob because he was he was trying to do it by his intellectuals he saw Esau was formed far more of a gentleman brother Brown said and a neighbor and a man of works and what Jacob was listen Esau Esau was probably always at the hospital he was probably always walking down the aisle of the hospital I'm bringing over in this day I bring it over in modern days he was probably always working at the soup lines he was probably always volunteering his time he was probably always down at the homeless shelter he was probably when you go to Walmart and when he saw I would go to Walmart and and pull up and see somebody begging for money there he'd probably always give him some money he probably he was probably always at the nursing home singing and playing instruments and stuff he was probably always busy mowing the Widow's loans he was probably always a bag of candy he saw I'm looking I'm bringing it up to modern times he had a he had a bag of candy that he brought with him to church and he had passed it out to all the kids he was doing everything right Esau was going to all the kids soccer games and all the football games and all their after-school events so nobody could get upset with him he was doing everything right he was doing all the stuff by the book but you see that's not what's required Esau didn't care about that Birthright he cared so little about that Birthright that he sold it for a little bowl a little soup every time I'm in the grocery store and I see little soup on the supermarket on the on uh up there for sale I think he saw you sold your Birthright for that can of lentil soup that's what you sold your Birthright for but Jacob Jacob had a recompense to that Birthright you know how much recompense Jacob had to that brother right he's he said within himself I don't care if I have to run away from my house if everybody hates me if my daddy don't like me anymore if my if I lose all my reputation if if I had to be a little cheat for a little bit or he was willing to give it all over to get that whatever he had to do to get that birth right and I think some of us sometimes we sit so cold and we can't even squeeze a tear out we can't hardly to get moved At All by the preaching of the Gospel but Jacob was willing to give everything for that for that Birthright why because it meant something to it and it missed you know what the birthright means to you today it means eternal life it means deliverance from all that to all that stuff that you're dealing through all that turmoil of your mind it means peace and joy in your soul when you lay your head down on your pill at night peace to know that God is with you that God cares about you peace to know that in time of trouble there's somebody that you can turn to that's past all the men and all the great things of this Earth but there's a God that you can turn to that's touched by the feelings of your infirmities Esau was a gentleman in every respect but Jacob had recompense to that Birthright that's his whole motive no matter what it cost him he wanted the birthright y'all realize I'm just preaching what brother Brown said I hope I don't know how many people realize but I'm just saying what he said he said say what I say and that's what I'm doing I'm saying what he said let me ask you this question how many how many Jacobs do we have here this afternoon how many are willing to just lay everything down for that Birthright how many you say well I've already got the new birth but there's more of that for you there's more if you'll just keep climbing I bet you've got to be willing to lay everything down for it you know sometimes you get to a place where it seems like you hit a wall and you hit a ceiling but sometimes you gotta you gotta really you gotta push to break through you got to study a little bit more you got to pray a little bit more dig a little bit deeper study into the wee hours of the night because we're going somewhere where are we going we're going to a body change to the final baptism of the Holy Ghost where God feels every fiber of your being until every atom in your body has changed Jacob was going to get that blessing it didn't matter to him if he had to sneak around to get it if he had to endure trials if he had to run for his life if he had to leave his father and mother it didn't matter does it matter to you does it matter the Holy Ghost is what makes the difference the Holy Ghost the birthright is what makes the difference why does it make the difference because the Holy Ghost is what quickens the word we read all these things and we pack in all this knowledge you know that's what you're doing when you're going through sanctification you're packing in that word your people say things I don't understand man you study out a little bit more and then then you you got to a place where you got it laying there but it's intellectual but the spirit will Quicken it and make it live you you think well as the Bible says I'm supposed to love somebody the Bible says I'm supposed to be real forgiving but when that Spirit comes and quickens it it makes it live it makes it come off the page that's why it brings life to the body it puts the puzzle together it puts all these things that we're studying together it puts all the statue of a perfect man and adoption and the Capstone and Daniel 70 weeks in the revelation of the Seven Seals and who is this Melchizedek and it puts it all together and ties it all together so you can see the complete revelation of Jesus Christ the power the spirit of the Living God is what powers the church it's what runs the machine do you realize this is a machine did you realize that you know we didn't talk actually before before today about who was gonna who's gonna take up prayer requests and this morning I took up prayer request and this afternoon Louise took up prayer requests and nobody I don't think anybody said well you need to take up prayer requests I don't think anybody did but it just why because there's a spirit of a living God that's that just moves moves you today and starts listen if you yield yourself the machine will just run the machine will just operate it'll just move oh the spirit of the Living God is what draws The Sinner and brother said he said if he can present the program and talk about these modern churches we'll build a great church we'll call it a certain name we'll attract the attention of the people all through the city when we play Chimes every Sunday morning we'll attract the attention to the poor Law Center in the gutter when he sees it we wear the better clothes when he sees it our women can fix their hair the poor women can see how women can do their hair what nice hats they wear and we when we present this to the people the poor and hungry will then come to our meetings and will desire to be as these women are and he goes on and on about all these things that churches think think is what draws people if we have a nice Clear Place Glass Pulpit if we have a Starbucks down in the bottom if we have a nice a nice little place glass thing around the drum set if we have some lights and maybe a little smoke machine that might that might draw but if we can if we can maybe have a little Outreach where we give sandwiches to the poor and things but you see that's not that's not what draw what draws actually what draws the the Stony heart is not a church that works real hard and puts everything out on social media and just stays busy busy busy busy busy busy busy but what draws is the spirit of the Lord moving the spirit of the Living God brother I'm sitting down if that is God's program they're right but Jesus never quoted that that way he said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men to me and he said but man is not drawn to Christ by intellectuals by theology the Holy Spirit alone is God's drawing power the Holy Spirit alone is God's drawing power the poor will never receive it and the rich can't until they become poor of these things of the world so don't be critical now when you're sitting here don't be critical don't be critical of the spirit moving in the church don't be critical is that because that's what we need that's what we need more of is we need the spirit of the Living God moving somebody might get too fanatical that's listen we'll deal with that when the time comes somebody somebody might get false anointed well we I think we got enough teaching when we can avoid that that's right somebody might get a you know what somebody might get I might get a genuine salad salvation they might get a genuine healing they might get a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost because what do we want we want a genuine Christianity not something acted out brother said in this being the intellectual type of churches that we have today in America and all over the world the Christian the believer the church member reading the Bible sees that he must try to act humble he must try to be this way but in doing so he only makes a carnal impersonation let that soak deep a carnal comparison he's trying to act something that he really isn't in his heart in his heart he's thinking one thing and trying to act another which in real genuine language that makes him a hypocrite so there's your definition of what it means to be an intellectual you know you should be humble so you're trying to be humble you know you shouldn't lie so you you try not to lie but when the opportunity arises you slip out a little lie just to kind of cover things up and cover Your Tracks you know you know how to fake it because you can read what's required and you know when to be careful you know when you know some Doctrine but this new deal that God is with the church that was presented at Pentecost is not an intellectual at all but 120 fishermen tent makers and Housewives went up in the upper room and waited until God's prophecy was fulfilled and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus told them don't you stop your preaching don't Don't Preach just go over to Jerusalem and wait because if you just keep preaching it's going to mess everything up you need to wait until you're endued with power from on high because the spirit of the Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what puts the doctrine together if it wasn't for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter wouldn't know how to open up the door when he came down when he came downstairs that day he wouldn't have known what what uh how to answer that when they said men and brother and what should we do he'd tried to put together with his own intellectual thinking you know what intellectual Faith intellectual Faith can't produce the power intellectual Faith Can't cast out devils intellectual Faith can't produce the signs and these signs shall follow them that believe and that's important when you start getting into this scripture that we're preaching on this afternoon Ezekiel 11. because devil a devil's got to be cast out the unclean spirit's got to leave an intellectual Faith ain't going to cast it out that was to be the sign of the believer instead of the educated and intellectual because the intellectual the intellectual cannot produce that the power of God in their life right right I feel like I should just talk for five more minutes so y'all can get your nap out it's all right I'm being nice Ezekiel was Ezekiel was looking ahead though he was looking ahead that God was going to make a new church a new church with a new testament New Covenant what kind of a New Covenant that God would put his life into the church a new priesthood with a new heart that's why Ezekiel 11 says I I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of Flesh not not you're going to do it but I God will take that Stony heart away not you'll throw it away but I'll take it away in other words it's Grace God is the one that's doing the work I will take the old Stony heart out and put a fleshy heart in now watch he said he would do that you can't talk that in an old intellectual church because the intellectual Church would just want to fake it and just go along with her old carnal idea but a church that wants a genuine baptism in the Holy Ghost wants something real not an intellectual facelift not just a facelift where you go into the surgeon and they pull everything up and straighten out your face but but down on the inside you're really 70 years old or whatever down on the inside you're really 65 or whatever it is but you got a facelift to make you look real pretty on the outside but on the on the inside you're still as old as you as you always were he's at the intellectual with the old lady they give her a facelift she's still the same old woman the old man they give him a facelift he's just the same old man I turn my new page on New Year's and I'll start life new I'll throw away my pipe and pick it up the next day that's just you it ain't a face lifting it's a birth the church needs the church needs the spirit of the Living God you say I'm gonna go I'm gonna stop smoking I'm gonna be I'm gonna be nice to my wife now and you play make that play we're coming on toward the end of the new the end of the year on into the new year and people are going to make make their pledges this next year I'm going to be a better person I'm going to be I'm going to be nice to my husband I'm going to be nice to my wife I'm gonna stop snapping at people at work I'm going to stop being so ugly I'm going to be I'm going to be real active in the neighborhood I'm going to give to all the poor and help the homeless and all those kind of things but we don't need a facelift we need a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't need our works what we need is Christ we don't need our resolution as we need verse yeah so first brother I'm saying I'm finally almost as as we're almost to an hour I'm getting to my topic but don't be scared I'm not going to keep you I know how everybody oh no he's still got a lot of water left in his in his jug he's got a we're just being real we're all we're at home this afternoon and brother I'm sitting down notice the first order of the scripture is perfect God said first I'll take away the old Stony heart what's that Stony heart you can't receive nothing How You Gonna receive anything if your heart's so stoned up that you you can't even squeeze a tear out you can't even raise your hand up you don't respond you can't even hardly Say Amen the Lord is not unto them that are of a broken heart a broken a heart that's all tilled up ready to receive God a heart that's that's that that's that's that that God has turned from Stone to flesh and savings such as be of a contrite spirit that's why David said search me o God and no more you know what a a fleshy heart a fleshy heart is willing that they're they're seeking they're willing for God to search them out and find the trouble find the problem are you willing this afternoon for God to give you a little inspection to go lay on the operating table and let the doctor of God's word examine you and find out what's wrong a soft heart is broken up and ready to receive God and then he said I'll give you a new spirit yes the spirit you had you couldn't even get along with yourself so how you're going to get along with God what's that mean you couldn't get along with yourself you run out you run out to the liquor store and as soon as you get drunk you got a headache the next morning you got a big old migraine and you start I wish I wouldn't have done that if I could just stop drinking if I could just stop doing that oh you you get alone sometimes when your mom and daddy ain't looking and you start looking at dirty dirty magazines or dirty websites and the very next day what are you gonna do all right right after you're gonna I wish I wish there was how can I get rid of this iniquity how can I get you might not use that word how can I get with it rid of this problem in my life children that backed out their parents and say something horrible and get in trouble for and you how I wish I wouldn't do that disrespectful people running around chewing tobacco in secret and they know they shouldn't do that they got that little tobacco water in their back pocket and they come to church and they they know they shouldn't and they know people are looking at them but they know they shouldn't be doing that but they're the spirit that they got they can't get along with themselves there's something there's something grieving them on only in their their own natural abilities you know when you you think back to people in in high school sneaking around behind the football stands and doing stuff they shouldn't and then as soon as they get done I wish that I wouldn't have done that you can't get even alone with yourself you can't get along with your own actions you're regretting your actions the very next morning and what what ends up happening you end up despising yourself that's why all these suicides and things among young people the the devil gets you into a fix where you you can't even stand yourself and you start I don't like myself you can't get along with yourself oh you know the commission that Jesus gave was go into all the world and preach cast out devils in my name they shall cast out devils in Matthew 10 he told them before they even got the Holy Ghost the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out devils freely have received freely give we've been commissioned to cast out Devils cast out what Devils cast out that unclean spirit and when that uncle's clean spirit's gone then you're you're set so that you can believe so that you can receive how you cast out Devils the same way Jesus did in Matthew chapter 8 he said when they even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick it's the word that cast out the devil the word can still cast out the devil and the word can still bring a new life the new spirit what's the new spirit do makes you want to do right now he got rid of that unclean spirit so you're you're feeling better you raise your hands in church you you start coming to church now I I'm ready I'm ready to hear about God you want to study your Bible you want to pray you want to dress right you want to be in the presence of God you love being you love going to camp meetings you love you know jumping around in the prayer line you know you love that because you love the spirit of God you want to worship because the unclean spirit's going out you want to be around God's people and what what does it end up being I see we started off talking about how God is drawing you he's drawing you to a nice cleaned up home a cleaned up Tabernacle you are the Tabernacle of God God's trying to clean up your house so that he can come and live in it without unclean Spirit goes out that house is all swept and garnished you you know you see you look online at houses that are for sale in today's market people they'll put they don't put an old dirty picture of the house that they want you to buy and come live in on the website but they picked they put a nice picture of a house that's been swept and garnished because they want you to live in it that's that's the kind of house that God wants to live in he wants to live in a not not some dirty filthy place with with clothes and and you know close out on the clothesline and just don't laugh he wants he wants a home that's cleaned up and swept and garnished brother said when the devil that once brought you down to the alley comes back and finds his old alley has been changed by God sent his big bulldozer down he dug up the Earth he turned things upside down he made a different view out of it he sent his bulldozer down and cleaned it all off here's his bulldozer brother he's holding up the Bible you can bear with this sweeps her all out bulldozes it all up and he begins to plant Gardens and he finds a great new modern homes built there that's what the devil finds if he tries to come back yeah what is it the house is ready for occupancy the unclean spirit's gone now now you're reading the Bible now you're you're studying you're praying the house is all swept and garnished it's got It's got flowers planted outside it's got candles lit I know y'all sisters are putting out your fall decorations that's what garnishing is you put out your Little Flower your your leaves and your your little uh scented broomsticks and stuff and and you're you like those candles with it they smell like pumpkin spice and all that kind of stuff that's that's a garnished house it's it's swept and it's garnished and it's cleaned up and it's ready it's ready for somebody to move in the house is ready for occupancy so brother Ryan will say he said your first step is a heart of Flesh a heart of flesh is I don't want to go to hell I want to accept Christ and your second step is a new spirit what's that new spirit a new desire I want to do right then God's holy spirit God's spirit the holy spirit sets right in the center of your new spirit and there it controls your emotions what what is that when when God comes and lives in you when he lives in you then it's like you know you sometimes you drive by houses at night and you wonder if anybody lives there and I've I've we've we've we've driven over the years to church and we've watched houses that that people kind of fell into a disrepair and you start seeing the roof cave in and seeing the house kind of fall down until as long as we've been coming to church here there's one house we watch to actually fall all the way to the ground and you can tell there ain't nobody living there but if there's somebody that's living there there's somebody that's going to keep that place clean there's somebody that's going to keep the roof patched and the pantry full is going to keep somebody that's going to keep food there that's going to attend the garden there's somebody that's going to be able to answer the door when the Devil comes knocking there's somebody there is going to kick out any squatters anybody that comes around and says well you can't have access to this no this is my property this is my promise in the Bible that's what the Holy Spirit does the holy spirit is there in your Tower knuckle and he's there to kick the devil out when the Devil comes around and says well you can't have healing you can't have this promises laying in the Bible you I don't know if this is for you the the Holy Ghost is there to tell the devil I I when you know like uh solicitors come knocking on the door do you want to buy something no I don't want to buy what you're selling I don't want to buy it get out of here and there's somebody there at the house you drive around at night this is my point that I was talking about that you drive around at night sometimes and you don't know if somebody's living there but there's a light on there's a light on in the house and you can there I know somebody's there because there's a light on in the house and when the Holy Ghost is there the light is on and let me tell you tonight there is a man that could turn on the light if the gospel is all confusing to you you don't know what it's about there's a man that can turn the light on so that somebody is home listen the neighbors can tell if somebody's home or not the neighbor if you got a dog there's a dog barking the signs of life in the house the signs that somebody's there because the light is on Christ has taken up residence Christ is there and he's in control when God moves in he's in control of you and brother I said it's like a mainspring you know what a mainspring is and a watch the mainspring is you you wind it up real tight IT coils around and you wind it up and it actually is the thing that gives power to the watch you wind it up that's what you turned that little thing with and it winds up that mainspring and for the rest of the day it's turning the hands of that watch but the Holy Ghost is a mainspring that powers your life it's down on the inside and it Powers your being it Powers your thoughts it Powers your Consciousness it Powers everything but it's a mainspring that you don't have to keep wound up it was wound from eternity from the foundation of the world like brother Louise was talking about this morning brother see you don't have to wind it every day God's wound it once for all and he sits right in the middle of your new life and as the mainstream is bringing it as it relieves and ticks away that what the watch it controls every little organism of that watch to perfect time it controls everything it controls because God is in the house now this afternoon how would you like for God to live in your house to control your thoughts to control your being to control your makeup to power your mind to power your thinking to give you a power that when you can speak your word and speak peace into your family speak your children back to home speak your loved ones back that God has given that kind of a power I'm not just speaking something of intellectual understanding this afternoon I'm speaking of living reality to you that if you'll yield yourself to him God will come and Tabernacle himself in you and set up resonance in your home and turn the light on so that all the neighbors and you know and you're all around can see that somebody lives there somebody is at home it controls everything that's within you put you in decent makes the church acts orderly makes the gifts work perfect and if you have to be taken from a place where you think you should be and put down somewhere else it controls oh now he's getting real maybe somebody on church say well you shouldn't do that or whatever the Holy Ghost in you will keep you from being offended he said that shows the mainspring is not there when you blow up at every little thing that happens and when the pastor happens to hit something that's in the word and you and brother Brown makes a spitting noise say I don't believe that look out old cowhide he's talking about those you can't put new wine in Old bottles because a old bottle will blow up what's blowing up means blow it up you ain't got that that Holy Ghost anointing over the cow High over the hide to make it expand and so when the word Goes Forth you start saying well if I don't get my way if I don't get my way in the church I'm just leaving out here if they won't come to to everything I put on I'm leaving if I I don't understand why I don't have to dress modestly I don't understand why I have to do this I'm leaving I'm out of here if that preacher wasn't so long-winded I could go to church if that preacher if that preacher would preach a little bit shorter if he would stop stepping on my toes and but boy I could really go to church see you need a little bit more of the Holy Ghost to all of the cowhide well you get enough holy ghost in you come to you'll bring the Holy Ghost with you to church and when somebody steps in your door of your home they'll find out the Holy Ghost is already there you say well I don't want to be humiliated I don't want another I don't want my pride to us or nothing I can't stand for them to call me a Holy Roller you need a little bit more oil how oh how about this I think I'm fine just the way I am that's the that's the worst one of all sometimes you try to talk people and you know if you think you're fine the way you are it I just can't stand to talk to somebody where they say dang nothing you can tell me that would change my mind because you didn't closed off every Avenue possible you've done closed off all avenues of communication you can't even have a conversation with somebody like that but when you got his Spirit it makes every emotion everything ticked just right to the word of God when Christ is there well Christ is there it makes bearing that cross a joy to bear I'll be closing in just a second brother said when the yoke is lined with a joy and peace and sweetness of Christ in your heart then you just pick up all the burdens the World cast on you and bear them to a certain Hill called Calvary and there you kneel down now here here's a real evidence of being born again and pray for the one that was persecuting you let's ask that question tonight this afternoon can you pray for somebody that you're real upset about somebody that you just they're just greats greats all your gears not rain fire out of heaven and tear up the church but you bring peace to them God be merciful to them you know when they ask Jesus how to pray and and Jesus said after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which aren't in heaven Hallowed be thy name listen to this recipe that he gave us to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done and Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us forgive us our deaths as we forgive our debtors brother Ram said forgiveness is tied in with faith because if you want your sins forgiven but you're not willing to forgive somebody else oh you've reached a stopping point I think that's why so many people reach a stopping point because what they do is they build up grievances in church they build up all this they've got all this stuff built up about why they don't like something and they don't think something should have been done certain way and they build up things and they are unwilling to forgive and Jesus said lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and and ever it for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not man their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses now you see there there's something a power that's been given to the you realize you've got the power in your heart as a born-again believer to forgive somebody that you can let it go that when somebody does something to you that you don't like and just you don't have the right you're not treated the right way that you think in church you're not doing the right way you think everything is done wrong and you just build up all this bitterness you see you can't move forward until you let it go but a holy ghost-filled Christian has the power to Let It Go you've got the power to forgive your unjust boss at work you've got the power when you're not treated right to forgive them you got that power you've got the power to forgive the people at church that you go to church with that maybe didn't treat you right maybe didn't shake your hand shaking shaking your hand is the example we always use but you know it's usually not shaking hands if somebody says something to you or does something that that really uh man you go home and it Grieves you and vexes you but as long as you hang on to it you're the one that's suffering not them they might not even know but you hang on to it but God's given you the power to Let It Go as a Holy Ghost Field Christian how about this forgive forgive your unbelieving spouse maybe you got an unbelievable spouse here and you just you just got some bitterness built up but you've got the power to forgive them they they don't agree with the way that you want to raise your your kids or agree with the way that you want to conduct your life or maybe even the church you go to and it's just it's just giving you all kind of grief and maybe you build up a lot of bitterness and things but you can forgive yeah you can forgive you can forgive the preacher that hurt you now there's some the deacons that said something to your children and now you built it all up until you're grieving and you're grieving the Holy Spirit Away but you can forgive you can forgive why because you've been forgiven that's how you can forgive if you look back in your life and think about all the things that you've done wrong and all the grace that Believers have have given you and shown you and think about all the grace that God has shown you and think about all of that all that you've been guilty of that allows us to forgive you've got the ability the supernatural ability you know that's a supernatural ability that's got to be something Supernatural the world you know those co-workers you work with that are always complaining and they come to work and you know they have a horrible home life they don't have that same Supernatural ability because they've let it built up to a place where they just they're just grumpy to everybody they come they hit the ground running it worked grumpy that the coffee ain't made right everything's just not going their way but you are different because God has given you the ability to forgive why because God has moved in the Holy Spirit has moved in the Holy Spirit took the place of the beer can the Bible took the place of the modern day literature the spirit of God took the place of modern theology the prayer meeting returned to the home when the Holy Spirit come in all the other things has gone out let's examine ourselves this afternoon could that be said of us has the prayer meeting returned to our home has the Bible took the place of all that modern day literature do we have a stack of worldly magazines laying there on the coffee table the spirit of the Lord is the mainspring of the heart the spirit of the Lord is our power the spirit of the Lord is our strength as the musicians come the spirit of the Lord is what we need the spirit of the Lord is what powers us and what powers the machine what gives us strength is what answers the door when the Devil comes knocking the spirit of the Lord is the man that keeps the light on the good man of the house that puts all of the scripture together that same spirit that brooded over the Earth thousands of years ago is still brooding and calling I wonder if you hadn't let him in yet will you let him in
