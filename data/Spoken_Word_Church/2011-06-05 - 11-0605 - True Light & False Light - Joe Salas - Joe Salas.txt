TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I'm going to kind of try to uh it's a true light and a false light so I'm trying of going to go a little bit on the false light so uh the first light that ever came into the world was uh God spoken light he said there let there be light and there was light in the first first john5 it said that God has life in John 8:12 Jesus said I am the life of the world no was the light for his day Moses was the light for his day Elijah was Al light for his day and in the end time the only light this world will'll ever see will be in the in the bride also in the end time the Holy Ghost will be the light which is is our guide and God always separates the light from the darkness uh let's go to Matthew 27 she got it over here 27 45 46 and then 50 this is when Jesus was crucified he said now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the 9th hour Jesus Christ with L saying I can't pronounce the name that is to say my God my God why is forsaken me and 50 says Jes Jesus when he cried again with a li voice till you yield up the ghost but he said I will not leave you without on Darkness I will send the light which you send the Holy Ghost in John 16 7 so here's a man that can turn on the light when we have Darkness he says nevertheless I tell you that it is experien for you that I go away for I if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but uh but if I Deport I will send him unto you uh 13 who when he said the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth or he shall not speak of himself but who whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come which is the holy ghost at same time brother said and today it'll be light in the evening time and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this revival is God's light in the last days let's go to Mark 5 2 to 12 I read this before but it kind of goes in with this what I'm talking about and he when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because they had been often bond with feathers and chains and the chains had been plugged by him and the feathers broken into pieces neither could any man tame him and all night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw Jesus AAR he ran and wor ship him and he cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with the Jesus the son of the most high Aur thee by God that do torment me not he said I know who you are you are the light of the world okay for he said unto him come out of the come out of the man the unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name he answered and say my name is Legion for we we are many and he bestowed him that he would not send them away by the country there was not unto him the mounts of great her of swine and all the Devils received him saying send us into the swine that we may enter unto them so when he came he was a light so the darkness has to flee when the light is presence we've been busy this week so I might keep you guys here five minutes I'm still on there's a man here that can turn the light uh on the message uh brother said uh nothing natural nothing natural or spiritual can live without God's life life can only come then but light nothing natural spiritual can live without God's light think of that all right but when he sends us a light see and does all these things and then we reject it it now that's the pitiful part is when light is rejected when he sends it to us and I'll say this with all love and respect so there is something spiritually wrong with a man that run back into his denominations the Creeds and refuse to see the Bible light when it's shining right before him there's something wrong with him see he goes back into his cre and forms and shuts the doors and says there's no such thing as that the Miracles the days of Miracles has passed there's no thing as divine healing there none of these things that was for an apostle that man is spir spiritually crazy there's something wrong with him he has pulled down the curtains and rejected the holy spirit that came can come upon him if he can and that's the very reason today that that's match it that Jesus Christ still is the same it's turned down because the people are living in a glare of other ages the same reason they're turning down now we notice we have to say that a glare is the kind of a false light and glare is a false light same thing that glares like a mirage on the road you go down the road and if you driving cars and look down ahead of you when you see this the sun on the ground and it reflects the light like a mirage look like there's water all over the road but when you get there there's nothing there it's only a false Mirage the glare of a True Light usually in on the desert like when you drive in the PLS you know you go down this little there you can see that when you look you see like you look in and like you see water but you don't when you get there there nothing there you justat said that's what the was doing today showing people at Mirage a conso of churches a group of denominations which would turn out to be false because it's because there is real light shining that real light shining wasn't shining and Mirage couldn't be there real light said real light shines and that's they're living in a glare of another age another thing for it it's a hit and pass on now a glare this Mirage is false it's a glare of the Sun and that's the way they did the same thing a false glare of a True Light so is it today so has been in every age see the true word sign but they have been so traditionalized they they can't see that word they looking at glare and they're blind and glare will blind you there's are of off ofet it'll blind you Jesus said you're blind living a blind they they should be able to see it to see who had who he was but they didn't because they were living in that glare he said look what Darkness we we're in today look what's going on today look at murder rape Strife well has come to pass I believe what Billy Graham said in the last me meeting 10 years from now every citizen of California will have to pack a gun to protect themselves you can't put enough law enforcement and the people have just gone insane shooting murder rapes everything see it's going wild see upon the streets it's to day we're living in Sodom Sodom day you go to Atlanta you better be careful true he said a false light you know I was just thinking of something I was referring a lot about England but I was thinking about false light he said here not long ago you'll remember the greatest robbery that England ever had that was done it was a $7 million hold up I don't think there's ever been anything in the in the world to compare with it a great hold up recently of $7 million even Scotland Yard can get get it figured out he said you know how they done it by a false light so they put a light on the railroad track caution caution light on till they come to a red light and they stopped the train and there the robbery took place just at at that right place a false light will give the greatest robbery that the Nations has ever known you'll Rob the nations of the greatest hold up greatest robbery it was ever done by a false light he said that the greatest robbery the Church of God has ever had is a false light they glare the their denomination is it's robbed them from the power of the Holy Ghost he took from the church the very Lifeline robbed them of the word when they accepted a Creed instead of the word it robbed them how how important is the Holy Ghost he's our light he's our God he's our teacher he's our Joshua that will take us to the promised land if you don't have the Holy Ghost you won't be in that City say you'll die in the wild wilderness Exodus 10 2122 1021 and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand toward Heaven that there may there may be Darkness over the land of Egypt even darkness which may be felt and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt in 3 days they saw not one another neither Rose any from his place for 3 days but all the children of Israel had Li in their dwellings like like they said there was there was light and Goan everybody had Darkness Egyptians had Darkness Exodus 4 20 Exodus 14:20 and it came between the camp the the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but he gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night separate the night from the dark the light from the darkness anybody have any questions all that that you were reading was out of price it's we're kind talking about light you know which God is light and the other side is a false light or or darkness which has to do with with the devil not enough answer everybody but here can turn on the light message yeah only here's a man that can turn light thank you you you weren here for my first no oh you missed it okay oh you probably do you have to catch up a little bit no I know love it thank you okay Revelations 21 23 to 25 if you make it to here we made it home all the way Revelations 21:23 25 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the Earth Earth to bring the glory and honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut all day at all by day for there shall be no night there amen amen any anybody has anything to say that's all I got your happy birthday
