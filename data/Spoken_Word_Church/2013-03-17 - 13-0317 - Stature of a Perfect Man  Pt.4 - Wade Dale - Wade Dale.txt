========================================

our scripture in Peter second Peter one second Peter 1 we're going to read from the Bible Peter 1 okay second Peter 1 um why are we not uh hello hello there we go all right second Peter well second Peter chapter one well okay here we go second Peter chapter 1 hope everybody's having a good morning just remember when you shake my wife's hand today where it's been I'm going hug her I'm not going to shake her hand well just be careful cuz just remember when she Pi you yeah just just remember it you what Joy did you hear Joyce Wade her arms has been Far and Away what just remember when she fixes you suffer oh that that bother me that you near as much as it would yeah yeah that's right for AEK all right well fre is here so they must be on their way no they're not J's she's cleaning up she's got her gear on she did the B okay all right Simon Peter a servant Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and through our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue now see that's a call he's called us to something so this is a call he calls you to the new birth right but then he didn't quit calling you that's when he just began to speak to you like he really wanted to cuz he can't speak to you like he wants to while you're in the world because we're going to see right here this quote here where brother Brandon says see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church so he's not addressing it to the outside people he's addressing it to the church all right or the bride but see you can say church and not be not be misled because He is wanting the church to see this but we as individuals have to grow up that statue of a perfect man all right so now that's um the street no that's our new Sunday school time for Sunday school oh Lord where's it coming from there's one on top of the free in there all right to cut the cord this thing when's it supposed to go off supposed to give me a warning Bell right 15 till right at 10 and then 15 after for the young ones for them to go out okay all right whereby are given gifts unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these Prophet said these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escape the corruption that is in the world through lust all right and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience God less and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so does everybody see that it's it's seven ads faith is not an ad right right right faith is something you've obtained he said you've obtained this Faith all right Faith you've obtained this Faith then you got seven f 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 cuz you got to get charity in there you can't say 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven cuz you leave that one out so you add to your faith in other words what you believe add to what you believe virtue and to what you believe knowledge and to what you believe Temperance all right cuz we're Waring against the corruption that is in the world through lust so we're still Waring against that like I said you say well brother Brandon will say a little bit later on we'll not read it today but in the message he'll say oh I just got so so you're telling me I got to have faith I'll just have Faith No it's a birth it's something that is not and then is right okay you understand what I mean like the cow that was just calf that was just born it was not yesterday that's right it was there working you couldn't see it though with your natural life but now through a process it has been birthed so there's something new that's why they call it a new birth not an old birth made over it's a new birth totally different than your first birth all right so and when these virtues of birth is something totally different virtue is something totally different than what a man that would just give you everything he had or or and there's a lot of people like people like Warren Buffett and and um and um what's the other guy's name Microsoft guy Bill Gates they have virtue because people drew strength off of what they said and they become multi-billionaires but that ain't got one thing to do with God if they're not born again they're lost so being successful doesn't mean a thing that's right like brother Matthew was speaking last night it really doesn't mean a thing if you're wealthy right it's like brother bandam said said he said well well well God must be with me because it's a sunny day or God must be with me cuz cuz I'm prosperous he said that don't mean one thing he said you ought to realize God's with you in the prosperous and the days that you think he's not with you right he's there more like brother Matthew was talking about last night and that was really wonderful what that was 45 minutes of of of good preaching and about us as being the clay and the Potter doing the doing the work you know and it's true why would why would you not use a mason or or a steel worker well they use other tools to make what they make a Potter uses nothing but this right here there's no even before back in the 2,000 years before Christ when they first started making Pottery they make it the same way you walk walk across the street at my house and walk over across the street to that Pottery Shop they make pottery the same way it's just an electric wheel the other one they had was a wheel theyd spin with their foot they used to have and they used to have the one where they spin it with their foot and then they went into an electrical belt one about probably 72 when I started working over there and you can control it by your knee that and it would it would slow it down and speed it up but um that's why God used pottering the clay instead of an iron worker or a or a brick mason all right but he does use brick masons in allegories and steel workers in allegories but something personal to me and you he uses clay Potter and Clay cuz that's what we are we're clay and he's the Potter well see even then the analogy that that brother Matthew was bringing yesterday he puts it on the wheel and you got to be balanced you got to be in the center of the wheel of God will of God you got to be Center in the will of God all right wobbles and it does they'll have to take and tear it off and start over again cuz that thing's got to be perfect for you to mold the pots I've watched them do it hundreds of times a lot of my cousins are into that stuff so they make I mean just make a beautiful pot just out of their fingers and their hands so we've got that analogy to work with but let's work with it here and see he's he's put you on the wheel down here cuz when you throw that pot down and that or when you throw that clay down it's not a Pott it's a hunk of clay about this big they measure it out they weigh it they measure it out and when they throw that thing on the wheel guess what it's real wide it's real wide down here it's real wide down here but when he they start molding that thing they can either make a small skinny tall jar or they can make a wide jar but they have to put their hand down inside to do the molding not a lot done on the outside until it's done on the inside once it's done on the inside then you start working on the flowery arrangements and the handles and all that stuff on the that's what God's doing here and this statue of perfect man God's already put you on the wheel okay at Faith he's getting ready to use you and he can't use you when you're out there in the in the muuk in the mire but when he throws you on that wheel he's got a purpose and that purpose is to mold you and make you into his image and this is the image this is the stature of a perfect man but if you'll notice some of the pictures that and I don't think we have one but it's got Christ standing here with his head here but that's what it is it's this it's the actual divine nature of almighty God it's what Jesus portrayed when he was here on Earth how else are we going to know that's right we just going to say well try you got to have the divine nature of God okay you got to show me what it is right you got to show me how to get there cuz I ain't there been there before right but Christ had been there before he grew up grew to an adult and he knew how to go up that thing because he grew the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge God yeah in human flesh he absolutely did that's right cuz he was born in this Satan's Eden not sinful wasn't born in sin but when he came into this world all the attributes of Satan's Eden was bombarding him right but his flesh was old getting old his flesh wasn't it come from God that's right listen his flesh came from God but once he hit this Dimension MH once he hit Satan's Eden he was in Satan's domain now Satan didn't have dominion over him but now see Satan had dominion over us the Bible says that's right that Satan had dominion over us until Christ came the law the law had Dominion right until Christ comes all right so that's what happened when you're when you're naturally born you're born into Satan's Eden well well Jesus Christ the same way almighty God flesh of God spirit of God soul of God but once he come out of that womb he come into this part of nature not his nature mhm his nature was divine right but not part of this I mean not born like we were right so he didn't need a new birth right he was born already the right way that's right spoken word okay but he still was bombarded Satan didn't have a problem talking to the man in human flesh he really don't have a problem talking with him in theophany you understand I mean he's talked to the he's talked to the devil longer than he's talked to me and you that's right or he's allowed the devil to talk to him longer than we've been able to talk to God right right cuz he created him first that's right he was God's right hand man when God started creating he created Satan first then he created everything else up in the Heavenly but see then when we drop down here on Earth when Jesus dropped down here on Earth he had to grow in Grace and knowledge the Bible said he was perfected right by the things that he suffered right being made perfect by the things he suffered Jesus Christ yeah because he had a human he had a human brain he had a brain that's the same as yours he had to be your brother he couldn't be born some Supernatural sure his birth was Supernatural but when he come forth from the womb he was just like us that's right he had to go to the bathroom he had to eat now there was things he could control that we can't control but re but really brother Brown said he could have children he could have a family well then he was capable of Ling like you love I mean you understand what I'm saying he was capable of loving a wife that's what brother Brown said he could have had a wife that's right but he didn't what did he do he took and said I sanctify myself that's right but he knew that we weren't going to be able to do that that's right cuz we were born in this when he come into this world and started growing up I believe he looked around and said they have no hope except me I just really think he realized that when he got up into his 20s and up in in his later years I really realized he looked around and said these people have zero hope about me and that wasn't making nothing big of itself but what was inside of him was trying to get out right right that's what was inside of him that's why he had to die to release the life he had the eternal life in his body or in his soul right that's right and it was just like a capsule just like a just like a pill that you take right that's Co that's coated with a with a capsule right what's inside does you good that's right but you got to put it in an environment for it to come out that's right right before it'll do you any good so that's what was happening with Jesus Christ he had to be our brother so he had to come in the capsule mhm human flesh he had to come in that capsule tempted tried tired weary got a little ill one time i' say he probably got a little ill a few other times but that one was recorded right okay I just really do I think he just got ill with people well hey he walked into the Pharisees and he said he didn't say oh you bunch of hypocrites no the Bible said he said you Hypocrites Snakes in the Grass vipers be kind of bad if a man walked in a church today and start calling all of us that you'd probably get a little mad at him right come on well that's what happened did that holy God before he became flesh did he have to come into flesh to really understand understand I think he did I think God knows all things right but he really wants this Dimension drop down from because remember he could commune with Adam I know it's a little off our subject but it is on faith the found we got to get a good foundation here before we start up this thing all right but I believe that that God knows all things yes understands all things but he had to be a Kinsman he had to do it down here that's right he could not do it up there that's right right he had to do it down here right see all this all this stuff that we need and I say stuff lightly all these things that we need are not for him they're for us right they're for us but he had to because remember in the mind of God he was slain before the foundation of the world that gave coverage for everything you understand what I'm saying that gave coverage for Even Adam before Jesus died or even Abraham or or Sarah they're all under that before the foundation of the world he was stood as a l stood as a lamb slain he wasn't physically slain he had to come down here I've always told you one day you're going to realize this that I'm not just saying this cuz it's a a wayd quote but God is not having to prove to no one but Satan that he can live in a human body and that he can do exactly what he purposed Adam to do in the garden so really say is one that he's cuz out mouth of two or three Witnesses God in you God in Me God in you are going to prove to the devil how many times brother rown said that going to prove to the devil that this eve won't fall that's righten the Holy Ghost is a real timid brother Bram said he was real honorable and real Meek because if you don't want him around you'll go out here for a little while right okay same way with the Devil he's a gentleman even to Satan he's a gentleman the Holy Ghost is saying Hey listen folks does God have to prove anything no no he's God that's right right it's kind of like Dave Ramsey said said we think we're something and and God needs us well you know all he's got to do is snap his fingers or even think that you're dead and you're dead there's nothing anybody can do about it but what about a god though that limits itself knowing that there's no way we can understand him down here but he wants us back up to where he was at where we were with cuz see Adam and God talk face to face right there was no problem with just like me and sister wom we we can talk face to face cuz there's nothing between us right but now if they become something between us Adam says I fear I fear see God wants back to that Fellowship well he can't now because everything's dropped down into this Dimension and that blood had to be a covering before the foundation of the world but a but a person had to literally come down here though and shed that blood that's right because remember brother R said it was a thought first word manifestation so God thought of all this in his mind and this then he just manifested so that's the way it is with God and before the foundation of world he knew he was going to have to die but to allow Satan to prove who he was see we're proving that greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world that's right we're pro who's proving that does God have to prove that he's greater than the devil no can the Potter say to the clay no or can the clay say to the Potter why did you make me this way no Satan's the same way cuz he he's got to look to God and say God you're the Creator you're the one that created me but what Satan done he wanted to raise himself above God thinking hey I've got this power I've got this might I've got these things and I'm going to just go over here and make myself a separate Kingdom well now remember God's still God that's right he don't share his glory with nobody right he's still God right he's still the one that made this so he can do whatever he wants to with it he can destroy it but God Lives by his own law that's right that's right brother Dale remember him preaching on God limiting himself he limited himself because of the word but he limited himself because of me and you we can't understand why God lets these things happen we can't understand why God lets certain people die and certain people live and that's not for us to to question or sure humanly we can have question but once we start up this statue of a perfect man I don't want us to be questioning God why have you not given me this and then turn that thing around and say God give me this and then there'll be no question okay I want to be where we can see virtue working in our life okay okay okay where people want to talk to you where they want to draw strength where if somebody has a problem pick up the phone I'm not going to call a drunk about my spiritual life right right why there's no virtue there that I can draw from now I've got the Holy Ghost somebody else has got the Holy Ghost we can draw virtue off of each other but if you got the Holy Ghost and somebody else doesn't have the Holy Ghost sure you might be able to listen to some uh common things of Life June's father has a lot of wisdom as far as life lessons and doing business and stuff he's a he's a he's a highly intelligent man as far as just not school work smart but he's just an intelligent man he's made a good living off of doing things right but he thinks that's his salvation but see he's never he doesn't even know about I tried to talk to him about scripture about 10 years ago and he said well I don't know about that I don't know about that I said have you ever read the Bible he said yeah yeah when I was younger well he's almost he's 80 he'll be 80 this year and I told him that time that day I said I said Jean I said I'll I said I will listen to what you have to say about life lesson I said but when you come and start talking to me about God and what God's going to do and what God's going I said you don't have a clue you don't know what God's mind is until you get into his word that's this is his mind right here so I'll listen to somebody that's got good that's got good knowledge about things but that's that's just human that's right that's just human life that's right like Dave Ramsey people I don't know if he's born again or not that's up to him and God but he does have some good life lessons he does apply it to scripture so I listen to that but now as far as me going to him for something of my salvation I don't know that he's got the new bir but see I know brother Bob does so if I'm in trouble whatever pick up the phone call Brother Bob pray brother Bob because we got a connection we got the same daddy that's right we're at least we're in the same family right now he may not like to hunt or fish or but that don't matter right yet you become a preacher you either got to play the guitar your wife's got to sing and play the piano or you got to hunting fish so you got the fishing part now so you got to get in that hunting stuff man to be a real message believer babe message preacher you got to do that but see how we do all we stigmatize stuff and we think man this this guy's got to do this to be a no you know feed me the word of God I'll tell you whether he's born again or not right watch his life that's what I mean about this is life this is still life lessons that's right but it's the Life of Christ trying to trying I said trying cuz we can hinder him trying to work its way out yes cuz it's all in there Faith virt knowledge add to your faith well it's not that we're going to take and and you finish with this yeah you will be in a second all this coffee that's in this cup see this is coffee this is the Holy Ghost what's good in the morning good but look all that you need is in there that's all coffee right M all right now there's a little bit in this cup it's the same substance faith is a substance of things hope for okay there's some there's some coffee in the bottom of that but there's not a lot of coffee in there but it is coffee doesn't matter how much more I pour in there it's still coffee it's just more of it right got it it's just more of it that's right virtue right knowledge right Temperance right patience Godly this and ready to drink it out of this cup this is your cup you don't need thank you Father that you H this from the wild but you see that it's it's it's it's the same coffee it's the same Holy Ghost God just wants to add more but you know what if if if I was pouring that for sister Gwen and she goes no I'm I'm fine I'm full yeah I'm full I'm fine I don't want anymore yeah then you know what God will do timid Holy Ghost he'll just say okay that's all you got that's all you're getting that's true you're going to struggle and you we going to all struggle anyway but you're going to struggle worse cuz you need virtue you need knowledge you need Temperance you need patience right but when you say God fill my cup Lord that's right fill it up that's what it is see you got the cup the Potter this is what Pottery looks like when you finish with it but it's a real it's like a glob when it started you don't you don't look very good right you're going to stumble in you look just like a regular piece of of clay that somebody threw out in the yard but once that man takes that clay puts it on a wheel changes the environment hello changes its nature puts it on the wheel then he'll form this and then what's he going to do he's going to fill it remember remember the analogy brother Ram said about the bottle he picks the bottle up it's dirty well you don't want to put anything in when it's dirty justification sanctification he cleans it up puts it aside for service but not in service but what's he looking toward I'm looking to F this thing that I found this pearl of great price this precious thing I found in the field remember the scripture found these things in the field well what is it God found you out in the field of the world brought you in and made you a cup made you a cup then he want he doesn't want now what's a cup for fill it up a cup to just leave empty somewhere and just no a cups to be used when you're thirsty fill it up put some liquid in it you might even could put some cough medicine or something you know it's used for many different things but unless it's a cup you can't use it got to be a cup first yes ma'am so reason I said ma'am I forgot your name sister mil all right go ahead so you know like how you're pouring bit by bit and somebody says you know don't want just you know they stop right they still have that new birth but they're not absolutely and they get all the way that's when they can take that Rapture that's cor you won't take a body change with this much with this you can see it with that much coffee in your cup okay you have rapturing faith the Holy Ghost is rapturing Faith okay everybody understand that it's not that it's not that we're going to Rapture enough of us to get our head out that's Catholicism and and Purgatory no if you've got if you've got coffee in the cup guess what you got coffee in the cup you can drink whatever even if it's a little bit I mean man you be hot outside and even a little bit of water is good but a whole lot of water is better but a little bit of God of God a little bit of God will suffice it'll get you an a Rapture if you're here at Faith and you're born again you are in rapturing condition but you cannot take the change of the body you'll have to die before the Rapture takes place like dadd said many times you could die tomorrow and the Rapture take place the next day or you could die tomorrow at 9:00 and the Rapture takes place at 10:00 but you don't have enough you don't have enough faith in what you got do everybody understand that you got enough Faith you just don't it says add to your faith so it becomes personal so whose virtue is it it's yours whose knowledge is it it's yours not brother Dale right not mine that's right brother raay it's yours it says add to your faith virtue and and not adding to the word but but to your virtue knowledge cuz once you get it brother BR said and he uses this analogy and is so positive and so wonderful he said this is my eye God gave it to me well what what's he trying to say this is my Holy Ghost it was God's it was him it's him it was his at one time it wasn't mine wasn't in my possession but once he give it to me it's mine see my eye was in God's possession a long years millions of years ago in God's mind my eye was in his mind he knew I would have one but once he give it to me whose is it yours it's yours it's your eye so it's your Holy Ghost what you know what God's done he said here you do with it what you please and that's what he said he give you the Holy Ghost it's a gift right now gift with stipulations are okay but I like if a gift's a gift you just give it to if I'm going to give my kids $100 I'm not going to ask them to climb the roof or or you know cut the grass if it's a gift I'm saying if it's a gift if something for me and I'm giving them yeah but if it's a gift if I'm just saying here I'm giving you this see that's what God does he gives it with no stipulation cuz you can stop it at any time right but he wants you and gives you the coffee even though there's this much or this much it's still coffee this much of the Holy Ghost this much of the Holy Ghost what's going to happen is though that divine nature is going to work its way out and see then God's going to be able to use you more yes see he can use you at Faith but he wants to use you more he just doesn't want you to just come to church and be a message believer and be a Christian no he wants more he wants you to do more everybody okay with that cuz that's what really you got to believe that that's coffee right whether you ever taste it but the Bible says taste and see that the Lord is good once you keep tasting of it you're going to say man that's good that's right that's coffee I'm identifying what it is cuz what having the Holy Ghost you're just like a baby a babbling baby right you're going to fall you're going to stumble you going to you you're not going to know how to drive a car but up here you going to know how to drive a car Deanna Faith Dale has everything she needs to drive a car she's got her eyes she's got her ears she's got all of her faculty arms legs to drive the Machinery you understand yes but what is she lacking growth development she's a human she was born one right when you're born again you're born again at Faith a baby but you cannot drive God's car that's right okay you cannot drive God's car he's not going to allow you certain things you know why not because he is Larry he knows you are he's got faith in you you don't have faith in him enough Faith you understand what I'm saying to have that's why you add to your faith virtue add to your faith knowledge add to you keep adding from what you believe cuz if you don't believe in it can't have it that's true that's true this is a question that kind of pertains to the Saturday night if a person dies at Faith I mean not at Faith but a person who's Born Again dies say at Temperance when the Rapture happens will they have all of that I don't think so cuz I don't understand that but well the Bible says as a tree lenth brother Brown said if you're this here you're going to be that there it just changes your Dwelling Place death just changes your dwelling place cuz what are we going to and this is my we need to go this is my thought though if we're all listen listen real quick listen to me look at me don't look around look at me if I know everything if I know everything I'm right here okay just say this is I know everything now if 75 million other people know the same thing what we going to talk about we know the same thing it's going to be repetitious there's going to be people in heaven with different levels of understanding why do they put brother brandom up on a pedestal I thought we all supposed to be equal no no no they put him up and God said because of what you chose down here a great portion of Heaven awaits you now he never told me that he never told you that right but he told that man that so that's why that message of cheer down through the endless ages I believe it's going to be that we're all going to still be learning about God and think of the people outside the city there's going to be more people people outside the city folks than is inside the city cuz there's only going to be bride inside the city say if there's one in a million if there's a million inside there's a 100 million outside the city just because of one person one or 100,000 say they may be cuz the city's only so big it's, 1500 square miles so God knows how many it's going to be in there 144,000 plus the bride and him right but outside that city is a whole big world this world's not going to be destroyed you're still going to have this whole big universe I mean this whole big world There's 7 billion people living here now they don't have really a population problem certain places but if you scattered everybody out you wasn't if you had a perfect Utopia where there was no desert there's a desert out there that people can't live in but what if remember the desert's going to Blossom like a Roose so people can inhabit that so they make be 10 billion people outside the city that we can walk out every day and they're not going to know nothing some of them yes they're not even going to know how they got there I mean sure they're going to be brought to a a realization that Christ was in this sister right here and this man was a drunk adulterer whoremonger didn't care about Jesus didn't even know about Jesus didn't even go to church but because he changed her Tire God's going to give her him eternal life now just true there's no way he can can be up here right see there's got to be there's got to be levels to where people come in and then you can go sit down and say hey let me tell you about this yeah thank you first but he's going to thank you I've always said my Lord have what a way to get in are those people going to be able to come into the city they can come in but they can't stay they come in and go out we can go anywhere we want to right but they can't reside in the city that's just like you comeing to my house like can just come visit you come visit and then go back to your home all right and that's the way it is in the city it's just going to be the bride just going to be 144,000 inside that City now you can come in the Bible said that Kings will come in take a Le go back out all right they can't stay there now why did it say Kings if there's not going to be levels there's got to be more advantages though than just where you reside inside or out oh sure but inside you're his bride you get special privileges sorry I just believe that that this the light's never going to go out inside that City but it may it may be it may be daylight and dark right the way the Sun goes I mean God's not going to change this whole universe he's already set it in motion the problem is the world's doing this because of the flood but once that baby sit straight back up it's just going to go around and around but I believe that have Darkness outside I I just do but now inside the Bible says the lamb is the light and it'll never go out so what she's saying is just because you die at Temperance that automatically you should go up is that she's asking that's what she do I think as you die that's the way you are CH brother B says that death only changes your dwelling place because does not raise you up or down he'll be theop all right let me ask you this if you die at Temperance can you be honey if you have faith you're going to be
