[0:05] [Music]
[0:09] let the worshiper arise
[0:15] [Music]
[0:27] i surrender to the
[0:39] trust that's our desire this morning
[0:41] thank you musicians
[0:42] you may take your place i trust that's
[0:44] our desire this morning is to worship
[0:47] the king of kings the great i am
[0:51] if there was ever someone that should be
[0:53] worshiped ever someone who was so great
[0:55] that needed to be worshipped it was him
[0:59] jesus christ the lamb of god amen he's
[1:02] worthy
[1:04] he's a great king you know it says that
[1:07] i think it's in the book of micah
[1:08] or malachi because it's a minor prophet
[1:11] that starts with m so it's one of those
[1:13] two
[1:14] and he says i am the great king
[1:18] and you know when when god says i am the
[1:20] great king like if i were to stand up
[1:22] here this morning and say
[1:24] i am a great preacher
[1:27] now some of you would be like well yeah
[1:29] you know i've heard him before he's not
[1:30] too bad and some of you be like that
[1:32] brother
[1:32] is conceited he's arrogant and he
[1:35] probably needs to be taken down a couple
[1:37] pegs
[1:38] but when god says i am the great king
[1:41] it is just a statement of truth
[1:45] he is not being arrogant he is not being
[1:48] prideful
[1:48] he is merely stating exactly what he is
[1:52] amen i'm just happy to be here with you
[1:56] let's go ahead and we'll turn and we'll
[1:58] read our first scripture
[2:00] luke chapter 16 verse 16
[2:03] and then we'll also look at philippians
[2:05] chapter 3.
[2:09] um and then maybe i'll make a
[2:13] introduction for those who don't know me
[2:16] maybe so luke chapter 16 verse 16
[2:20] the law and the prophets were until john
[2:23] since that time the kingdom of god is
[2:25] preached and every man
[2:27] presses into it if we look at
[2:30] philippians chapter 3
[2:32] verses 14 and 15 here uh
[2:36] actually starting with verse 13. we will
[2:39] start
[2:40] philippians chapter 3 and verse 13
[2:41] brethren i count not myself to have
[2:44] apprehended
[2:45] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[2:47] things which are
[2:48] behind and reaching forth unto those
[2:50] things which are before
[2:52] i press toward the mark of the prize of
[2:54] the high calling
[2:55] of god in christ jesus let us therefore
[2:57] as many as be perfect
[2:59] be thus minded and if any
[3:02] if in anything he be otherwise minded
[3:04] god shall reveal
[3:06] even this unto you nevertheless one two
[3:08] we have already attained
[3:10] let us walk by the same rule let us mind
[3:12] the same thing
[3:13] and can we just bow our heads for a word
[3:15] of prayer heavenly father lord you are
[3:17] the great king you're worthy and you're
[3:19] wonderful
[3:20] you're worthy of all of our praise the
[3:22] the thoughts of our heart
[3:23] our meditations all that we are lord
[3:27] truly belongs to you and we count you
[3:29] worthy to receive it lord
[3:32] father we've asked your presence in this
[3:34] building and lord
[3:35] we know you've promised it by your word
[3:36] where two or three are gathered
[3:38] in the name well that that you'd be
[3:41] there
[3:42] so father i pray that you'd open our
[3:44] eyes and our hearts to see you
[3:46] to know you to feel you to know that
[3:47] you're here father not
[3:49] not just to know the promise
[3:50] intellectually lord but may we
[3:53] father may that promise be a reality to
[3:56] us this morning
[3:57] that we would know you were here father
[4:00] just anoint me to speak lord jesus that
[4:02] your words go forth and accomplish the
[4:04] thing that you send it to do father i
[4:05] pray that it would encourage
[4:07] and challenge strengthen the believers
[4:09] lord jesus but ultimately lord if
[4:11] if you could just commune with the heart
[4:13] of every believer here
[4:14] lord that then
[4:17] lord we'll just thank you for that lord
[4:19] that would be so much lord that would be
[4:21] better than the best sermon i've ever
[4:22] preached in my life lord
[4:24] if you would just be here and you would
[4:26] take control and
[4:28] you would have your way father for lord
[4:30] we
[4:31] we surrender our all as we just saying
[4:35] to you
[4:36] lord we love you you're so good and
[4:38] worthy
[4:39] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[4:41] pray amen
[4:42] amen you may be seated
[4:48] so we're just happy to be here um
[4:51] and um we we seem to we seem to have
[4:54] about an eight year cycle
[4:56] we were here about eight years ago and
[4:57] then about eight years before that so
[4:59] maybe
[5:00] you met us a little while ago and we've
[5:02] been friends with
[5:03] different ones here for um quite some
[5:05] time and have enjoyed it and
[5:06] met different ones and we had a nice
[5:08] time of fellowship
[5:10] yesterday um and

[5:15] and had a great time but
[5:16] i'm brother trevor my last name is
[5:19] eamond
[5:20] some people think trevor is my last name
[5:22] but trevor's my first name i usually go
[5:23] by
[5:24] just brother trevor because trying to
[5:25] say even usually ends up coming out
[5:27] edmond
[5:28] and you know and then some brothers just
[5:31] say it like that on purpose and then
[5:35] you know and because that's kind of
[5:37] church this is
[5:38] i've been picking up on you know it's a
[5:42] it's a difficult place here you know god
[5:44] god bless you people you know you make
[5:46] it hard on yourselves but you know
[5:52] so uh but uh just happy to be here and
[5:54] to be with you all
[5:55] brought my family my wife anime zion
[5:58] azariah and gloriana are here we'll
[6:01] we'll have a song this evening um with
[6:03] the afternoon service
[6:05] for you all um and i was just thankful
[6:08] the lord
[6:09] lord gave me i love to worship and the
[6:10] lord gave me a family that came
[6:12] worship with us and and i was telling
[6:15] the brother
[6:16] you know brother wade yesterday just how
[6:19] as the lord has progressed and we've
[6:22] progressed as a family and brought up
[6:24] and
[6:24] you know we had a we had our time where
[6:26] we had to kind of shut the church down
[6:28] for covid but at the same weekend uh
[6:30] um brother jack had come up brother jack
[6:33] duff from florida had come up to the
[6:35] service
[6:36] and brother nathan the pastor wasn't
[6:37] sure if he had it so he thought man i
[6:39] better stay away and so brother trevor
[6:41] you're gonna have to just
[6:42] run things this weekend so we shut the
[6:43] service you know everything down
[6:45] we brought a song leader my family and
[6:48] brother jack and his family and
[6:49] you know we so what that that what that
[6:51] gave us was that was me and i could
[6:53] introduce the brother and
[6:54] we had a a piano player and zion and he
[6:57] could
[6:58] play piano for the song service and then
[7:00] my son azariah ran the stream
[7:02] and you know we just and the song leader
[7:05] was like boy brother trevor you know you
[7:06] could you just
[7:07] you're just a church in a box your
[7:09] family you know and my wife's sunday
[7:10] school teacher and my daughter wants to
[7:12] become a sunday school teacher and so
[7:14] i just praise the lord and so um and we
[7:16] got a drummer too
[7:18] i forgot ezra plays the drums so we had
[7:19] a drummer there too and we just you know
[7:21] we could just have a service so
[7:23] i love to worship the lord and i'm
[7:24] thankful the lord gave me gave me the
[7:26] pieces around me to just worship the
[7:27] lord anytime
[7:33] so as a brother riley from kentucky used
[7:35] to say you know if
[7:37] if there's no believers around you then
[7:38] raise you some so
[7:40] [Laughter]
[7:42] so it's kind of hard for me to think say
[7:44] things like that raise you some that's
[7:46] not exactly
[7:47] you know the kind of english i usually
[7:48] talk so i hope that my
[7:50] my northern ways aren't too uh you know
[7:52] don't get lost in translation but
[7:54] you know i feel like i'm i'm quite a
[7:56] southerner compared to where i used to
[7:58] be
[7:58] i um i moved down to indiana southern
[8:02] indiana so we're right across there from
[8:03] kentucky and
[8:04] um you know i started working at the
[8:07] airport in lexington kentucky when i
[8:08] first moved down i was born in minnesota
[8:10] and
[8:10] lived out minnesota and south dakota so
[8:13] i sounded you know i sounded a little
[8:15] different
[8:15] we said minnesota that's where i was
[8:17] from minnesota and so i've lost
[8:20] you know much my accent that i used to
[8:21] have up there and so
[8:23] now you can understand me much better so
[8:25] you know i go back home and people like
[8:27] he has a southern accent you probably
[8:28] think like this guy's a yankee
[8:30] you know so i guess i'm not welcome
[8:32] anywhere but you know
[8:36] but that's who we are and um you know
[8:39] we've um
[8:41] uh we were at the branham tabernacle for
[8:42] about 20 years now we're fellowshipping
[8:44] with
[8:45] brother nathan bryant um at church of
[8:48] the open door in new albany
[8:49] and just enjoying the fellowship of the
[8:51] saints enjoying the preaching of the
[8:53] word and
[8:54] and praising the lord so just happy to
[8:56] be gathered in the name of the lord
[8:58] jesus christ
[8:59] happy to be following a prophet that god
[9:01] sent us in this last day
[9:03] and that's how i was raised you know i
[9:05] was i was raised on the tapes and so
[9:07] that's what i know so i didn't go to
[9:10] seminary i didn't learn theology
[9:11] anywhere but just this message so
[9:13] well praise the lord so hopefully that
[9:16] can just calm me down just a little bit
[9:18] because
[9:18] maybe some of you are thinking this
[9:19] brother's from where he's from
[9:20] jeffersonville and he's he's a yankee
[9:22] from jeffersonville and he used to go to
[9:24] the tabernacle and i don't know what
[9:25] he's going to preach to us now
[9:27] well just calm down it'll be okay
[9:30] because if you got the holy ghost you
[9:32] got the filter you don't
[9:34] you don't have to sit there and go oh my
[9:35] goodness what's he going to preach
[9:36] what's going to break you know it's like
[9:37] just
[9:38] rest in christ
[9:41] so praise the lord we're just happy um
[9:44] happy to be here
[9:45] very happy to be here so
[9:48] press the mark is my title
[9:52] and on my notes here you know i know
[9:54] you've heard 100 sermons on
[9:56] pressing um and and i'm different
[9:59] than many preachers that you've probably
[10:02] ever heard so on my notes it's pressed
[10:04] the mark and mark is underlined and so
[10:06] we really want to talk about the mark
[10:07] because if you're going to press
[10:09] to the mark well it might be helpful to
[10:12] know what that mark is you know it's
[10:14] like oh brother i've been pressing two
[10:16] yeah right right right pressing
[10:19] hard as a christian like yay for you
[10:23] that's great what's the point what are
[10:25] you doing
[10:26] where is it getting you to and that's
[10:28] what we want to talk about is what is
[10:30] that mark
[10:30] what are we what are we moving towards
[10:32] and brother branham in the message
[10:33] desperation says every man
[10:35] presses into it not simply walks into it
[10:38] easily
[10:38] but it has to be pressed into now when
[10:41] you seek me with all your heart
[10:43] then i'll be found i can tell you you
[10:46] know as i was seeking the holy ghost and
[10:48] you know as
[10:48] a young man easter sunday 1997
[10:52] i was in the service all my friends all
[10:55] the brothers were at the altar
[10:56] after service and i was standing in the
[10:57] back going lord you know should i be at
[11:00] the altar
[11:01] and have i you know i feel like i've you
[11:03] know i've been going to prayer meeting
[11:04] i've been you know living fairly good
[11:06] and
[11:06] and the lord said well what about that
[11:08] girlfriend you've got it's like
[11:09] yeah i guess that she's not exactly a
[11:12] believer is she
[11:14] and so standing right there i said lord
[11:17] okay i'll give that one to you too
[11:21] and that's when the lord filled me with
[11:22] the holy ghost why because then it was
[11:24] with all my heart
[11:25] that's when i gave him all that's when i
[11:27] fully subjected myself to the word of
[11:29] god and i said fine lord you know that's
[11:31] it's okay whatever you want for me
[11:33] that's fine and you know when we get to
[11:35] a place where we can surrender all
[11:37] man that's when the lord really began
[11:39] that's what we press into
[11:40] is pressing fully into christ to
[11:42] surrender all to recognize that
[11:44] everything i am is
[11:45] you know essentially worthless if it's
[11:48] not without him
[11:49] or if it's without him i must have him
[11:52] i've got to press into him and i've got
[11:54] to seek him with all my heart
[11:56] but let's look here for a moment at what
[11:58] paul is speaking to us here in
[11:59] philippians chapter 3
[12:01] you know verse 13 he says i count not
[12:03] myself
[12:04] to have apprehended the first
[12:07] church age messenger you know the one
[12:11] who wrote 80 percent of the new
[12:13] testament
[12:14] he hasn't apprehended yet man if he
[12:18] hasn't apprehended boy
[12:20] we in trouble brothers and sisters what
[12:23] are we going to do
[12:25] because you know how many of you has god
[12:27] given an affliction
[12:28] that he won't that he won't deliver you
[12:31] from because you have too much
[12:32] revelation
[12:35] because that was paul's state like you
[12:36] know i you know god said no
[12:38] you're going to have this he said
[12:40] because of the abundance of the
[12:41] revelation so he needed something to
[12:42] keep him humble
[12:44] but this man with so much revelation
[12:46] that he has an affliction to keep him
[12:47] humble
[12:48] has not yet apprehended
[12:51] so i think there's a case that maybe
[12:54] just maybe we should still be pressing
[12:57] but what should we be pressing towards
[12:59] well towards whatever paul was pressing
[13:01] towards
[13:01] that he had not yet apprehended and now
[13:04] don't get discouraged you think boy paul
[13:06] hasn't got it with all of his up you
[13:07] know
[13:08] who am i what am i gonna do hey
[13:12] you're never gonna attain
[13:16] well we'll talk about that but but but
[13:18] can you
[13:19] can you attain all of god
[13:22] you say brother trevor then we're gonna
[13:23] be pressing the whole time yeah
[13:29] brother trevor won't that get exhausting
[13:31] no
[13:33] no because the more you press into
[13:34] christ and the more you attain of christ
[13:36] the more you recognize there's so much
[13:38] more to have and you you could get
[13:40] discouraged but then
[13:41] but then you remember like wait there's
[13:44] no discouragement it's not like
[13:45] it's not like the pressing that i've
[13:47] done has all been in vain all it's done
[13:49] was
[13:50] was make me have a greater vision of
[13:52] christ which made me realize there was
[13:54] more to press into
[13:55] but i'm not going to get discouraged
[13:56] about that i'm happy when i recognize i
[13:59] learn that there's more of christ than i
[14:01] ever thought why
[14:02] because he's wonderful because he's
[14:04] great
[14:05] because everything that is good or
[14:06] lovely or perfect and wonderful in this
[14:08] world
[14:09] is him and when i recognize there's more
[14:11] of that to go around
[14:13] brother that makes me pretty happy that
[14:15] i get to continue to press into that
[14:18] oh it's it's wonderful you know we have
[14:20] we have
[14:21] we have uh you know they've done these
[14:23] studies these
[14:24] um you can read about them these reports
[14:26] you know and you know
[14:27] 60 years ago the cartoons you know if
[14:30] you
[14:31] maybe you remember steamboat willie or
[14:33] mickey or whatever it was you know you
[14:34] got
[14:35] you got a mouse on a piano you know how
[14:37] long that scene stays with a mouse on a
[14:39] piano
[14:40] well in today's time man it's a long
[14:43] time
[14:44] that scene stays there with a mouse
[14:45] playing a piano for like 30 seconds
[14:48] you watch any cartoon today there's
[14:49] there is no scene for 30 seconds
[14:52] there there's probably no scene for
[14:54] three seconds it's gotta
[14:55] change because it's got to keep the
[14:57] interest of the people
[14:59] but we serve a god who's so amazing he's
[15:02] so unchanging
[15:03] but the reality of it is is the more
[15:06] that the more you stay there
[15:08] the more you just look at his unchanging
[15:10] presence
[15:11] the more you find out how great he is
[15:14] he doesn't get boring
[15:19] you say brother trevor well i mean i
[15:22] appreciate this is church and everything
[15:25] i know that that's what you preach
[15:27] and that's what we should amen and
[15:28] that's yeah but brother trevor like
[15:32] if i'm honest i'm kind of bored
[15:38] sometimes
[15:41] amen anybody else or just just brother
[15:44] trevor
[15:45] like yeah it happens doesn't it it
[15:47] happens and when that happens
[15:49] it's not that you know and then when
[15:52] that happens then you're like why should
[15:53] i press
[15:54] you know it's kind of boring and i get
[15:55] kind of it's work
[15:58] to keep pressing what's because the
[16:01] it's because the mark is wrong right
[16:03] there you go it's because you you were
[16:05] pressing to the wrong mark
[16:07] and that's a problem you think but yeah
[16:10] but i get it now
[16:12] like no no paul didn't apprehend so if
[16:15] you're sitting there thinking well i
[16:16] apprehended and i pretty much got this
[16:17] christian thing down
[16:19] you're missing something you you
[16:22] you you set a mark here but the mark is
[16:24] way up there
[16:25] and you feel like i've reached it i
[16:27] don't need to keep pressing and it's
[16:28] it's getting kind of boring and it's
[16:30] getting kind of old and it's just kind
[16:32] of man i've been doing the thing
[16:34] for five 10 15 years and i'm there
[16:38] and it's just kind of you know
[16:41] huh every sunday
[16:45] every wednesday it's the wrong mark
[16:48] and i hope that the spirit can challenge
[16:50] you today to find the mark
[16:52] of the high calling in christ jesus
[16:56] and it's not just that it's christ jesus
[16:58] but it's that you have a high calling in
[17:00] christ jesus
[17:01] it's that he's so great and he's calling
[17:04] you to come unto him
[17:05] he's then lifted up that you would be
[17:07] drawn to him and as you're drawn to him
[17:09] you have a calling and you have a
[17:11] purpose and there's something for you to
[17:13] do
[17:14] and sometimes when a preacher tells you
[17:16] that it's just like yeah i get more work
[17:18] to do
[17:21] but again you're missing something
[17:23] because jesus is calling you
[17:26] and when he calls you to come unto him
[17:28] and when he calls you to a purpose
[17:30] and to serve him what he's calling you
[17:32] know look without a purpose what do you
[17:35] have
[17:35] right what are you living for
[17:40] well i you know i'm i'm living for
[17:42] caramel apples up there in helen
[17:43] well okay you know if that's your mark
[17:47] and that's your purpose and then
[17:49] but you talk about getting old after a
[17:53] while
[17:54] you gotta drive an hour to get a caramel
[17:56] apple it you know
[17:58] every sunday i draw my no i don't know
[18:01] what it is for you
[18:02] but when you begin to recognize that
[18:04] when when god begins to give you the
[18:06] purpose
[18:07] and begins to give you something to do
[18:10] there's absolute
[18:11] joy in serving him there's absolute joy
[18:14] because there's purpose
[18:15] because there's meaning because if all
[18:17] you're doing is coming
[18:18] and sitting in a church and going yeah
[18:20] brother trevor i'm kind of getting tired
[18:22] of the press the mark sermons
[18:23] well well you know i pressed and i've
[18:25] done the thing and here i am what do you
[18:27] want me to do
[18:30] i want you to see that the mark is so
[18:32] much higher because you set the mark
[18:34] here
[18:34] you hit it and suddenly you're not happy
[18:36] anymore
[18:37] suddenly there's no joy anymore and if
[18:39] there's no joy in your life
[18:41] how is god gonna use you
[18:45] because i'll remind you in nehemiah it
[18:47] says the joy of the lord
[18:49] is your strength if you're gonna have
[18:51] strength to fight the battle
[18:52] you're gonna have to tap into your
[18:54] strength which is the joy of the lord
[18:57] [Music]
[18:58] you say brother trevor i can't just turn
[19:00] the joy switch on no you can't
[19:04] but you can you can dive into him
[19:07] you can find the source of the joy
[19:09] because it's real
[19:11] amen you say brother trevor no
[19:14] no caramel apples is joy brother trevor
[19:17] is it what so then if caramel apples are
[19:20] joy and i'm just using that because it's
[19:22] something local that we just you know we
[19:23] could talk about ice cream usually
[19:24] that's what i say
[19:26] brother brother luis is like okay ice
[19:27] cream is joy so
[19:31] so if ice cream is joy what happens when
[19:34] you don't have ice cream
[19:35] right do you have no joy
[19:40] you say brother trevor see the problem
[19:42] is
[19:44] is is jesus is not tangible enough to
[19:47] bring me
[19:47] joy ice cream is tangible enough
[19:51] to bring me joy you know what you know
[19:53] what the world tries to trust
[19:56] you know apart from just the fact that
[19:57] you have no joy if you have no ice cream
[19:59] in your life and that's kind of a sad
[20:00] miserable existence you know
[20:02] come on somebody you know and so
[20:06] so so the problem is is that that we
[20:08] then we start looking at the things that
[20:09] the world calls joy you know
[20:11] relationships
[20:12] you know good or bad um you know
[20:15] uh beauty you know what whatever it
[20:19] might be that you you would find that
[20:21] the world calls
[20:22] joy i want you to think like
[20:26] let's let's talk about okay romantic
[20:28] movies you know these romantic comedies
[20:30] and different things you know it's just
[20:31] like oh i wish i could have a
[20:32] relationship like that
[20:34] that would bring me joy it's scripted
[20:38] this didn't really happen somebody like
[20:40] wrote this and then they acted it out so
[20:42] is it real or not
[20:44] is it tangible or not it's not
[20:47] okay if you know if i was so beautiful
[20:49] boy then i'd really have joy
[20:51] and you look at all the magazine covers
[20:53] and let me ask you are the girls on the
[20:56] front of the magazine cover are they
[20:57] real or not you say brother trevor of
[20:58] course they took a picture it's a real
[21:00] person that's a real
[21:01] yeah but then they took it through
[21:02] photoshop
[21:04] and layer upon layer of filter and all
[21:06] the makeup and the hair and the fans
[21:08] blowing the hair back and all of this
[21:09] stuff like
[21:10] what it and then they say this is how
[21:13] you should look
[21:13] and if you can look like this this will
[21:15] be joy what are they doing
[21:17] telling you something that's not real is
[21:20] joy
[21:21] hey you know yeah sisters i'm sorry but
[21:25] man you just don't have that you know
[21:26] your neck will never be long enough
[21:29] because they take those you know they
[21:31] take the women's heads on those pictures
[21:33] and they stretch that neck to make it
[21:35] look good because
[21:36] guess what it says and what is it isaiah
[21:37] something about outstretched necks
[21:41] well here we go so that look what
[21:43] they're portraying isn't real
[21:47] it's not real you say i need something
[21:49] real jesus isn't real enough
[21:51] jesus isn't tangible enough to bring me
[21:53] joy but everything else out there
[21:55] that that the world would try to tell
[21:57] you is joy is not
[21:59] real so you can't say like these things
[22:02] are real no they're not real
[22:03] jesus isn't real enough but these things
[22:05] are real enough no everything the world
[22:07] tries to give you that's that to give
[22:09] you joy is not real
[22:11] it's not good enough without alteration
[22:14] on its own
[22:15] but jesus christ is good enough without
[22:18] alteration on his own always will be
[22:22] always was and is right now
[22:26] and that that's not not just true that's
[22:28] not just
[22:29] good theology but it is reality
[22:33] but you you see you see the ice cream
[22:36] that you say that's real i can feel it i
[22:37] can taste it
[22:41] but but but again will you take it away
[22:44] what you have to say then
[22:45] is that there is no joy apart from that
[22:47] apart from the thing i have
[22:49] so obviously joy is something that's a
[22:52] little bit more intangible
[22:53] than just the reality so-called of ice
[22:56] cream
[22:57] there's got to be something on the
[22:58] inside that is joy
[23:02] there's a knowledge there's a truth and
[23:04] there's a purpose
[23:06] that can bring you into the joy of the
[23:08] lord
[23:10] and it's worth having the problem is
[23:14] is that we bring the mark down and then
[23:17] we hit that mark and go i'm good man
[23:21] sunday morning bro here we are what's
[23:23] gonna happen today
[23:26] probably the same thing that happened
[23:27] last sunday
[23:29] brother joe gonna sing again okay
[23:33] that's nice man can we sing a new song i
[23:36] am just
[23:42] man you all should have gone to the
[23:42] tabernacle for 20 years
[23:46] let's sing number one in the hymnal
[23:47] higher ground opening song 20 years
[23:49] straight praise
[23:50] god but hey i am pressing onto higher
[23:54] ground
[23:56] [Applause]
[23:57] so the problem is is that we bring the
[23:59] mark down so low
[24:00] that we hit that mark and when we hit
[24:02] that mark there's no purpose anymore
[24:05] there's nothing for us to do there's
[24:06] nothing in it for us
[24:09] we just you know we have to just
[24:10] continue to remind ourselves i'm saved
[24:12] by the grace of god and i don't even
[24:13] remember what that is now anymore but
[24:15] you know i mean it's been so long since
[24:17] i've been a sinner and i've attained
[24:18] some you know 20 years ago i attained
[24:20] you know the holy ghost
[24:23] and now i've just been you know coming
[24:25] to church and i mean what else do i do
[24:29] we'll get your mark a little higher
[24:34] i don't understand why these brothers
[24:35] keep telling us the press i did the
[24:37] pressing i got to the altar i got the
[24:38] holy ghost
[24:39] hey i got the ticket in my hand i'm
[24:42] going there like what
[24:43] what do you want from us preachers i
[24:45] want you to set the mark higher
[24:47] because if you set the mark higher and
[24:49] you recognize there's so much more out
[24:51] there for you
[24:52] man suddenly joy can start coming back
[24:54] and recognizing
[24:55] there is more for me and if there's more
[24:57] for me then he wants me to do more
[24:59] and then i begin to recognize hang on a
[25:01] second wait a second did i just say
[25:02] he wants me he wants me to do something
[25:06] brother zach he wants you to do
[25:07] something for him
[25:08] he has purpose for you can can we even
[25:11] say that
[25:11] you know i and you know i want to you
[25:14] all understand this the right way but
[25:15] can we even say that god needs you
[25:20] he has no hands but our hands he has no
[25:22] lips but our
[25:23] lips my goodness if god's going to walk
[25:25] around on two shoes or those johnston
[25:27] murphys he's gonna walk around in zach's
[25:28] johnston murphys
[25:32] god needs him god needs you
[25:37] he has a purpose and a high calling for
[25:39] you a high calling in christ jesus
[25:42] he doesn't want you to stop he doesn't
[25:44] want you to have attained
[25:45] he wants you to recognize that there's
[25:47] something higher out there for you
[25:49] that can inspire you can draw you up
[25:52] and then as you grow into it it begins
[25:55] to open up and you begin to recognize
[25:57] how wonderful this thing truly is
[25:59] and that it's not sitting on a pew for
[26:01] 20 years waiting on jesus to come
[26:03] but there's an action to it there's a
[26:05] purpose to it there's a
[26:06] there's an excitement to it because man
[26:09] i don't know how it's going to happen
[26:11] and sometimes it's hard yeah but man
[26:13] sometimes god
[26:14] shows up in that and it's awesome amen
[26:19] oh inspiring amen wonderful
[26:25] and you begin to recognize it's not just
[26:28] me
[26:30] it's not just small little me
[26:33] that doesn't mean anything that can't
[26:35] make an impact on this world i'm just me
[26:38] and i'm just waiting for jesus to come
[26:40] and i can't wait
[26:41] and okay great
[26:44] but then you begin to recognize no i'm
[26:47] part of something much bigger
[26:50] and that god desires me
[26:53] that god uniquely gifted me and called
[26:55] me and
[26:57] and oh glory to god
[27:02] you know the ephesian age brother
[27:04] branham tells us that that they had high
[27:06] aspirations that they aimed high
[27:09] but then they began to be relaxed and
[27:12] they left their first love
[27:13] but originally it was good because they
[27:15] aimed high now you see what did they aim
[27:17] at they
[27:18] there was a mark that they were they
[27:20] were aiming at
[27:22] you know and and and you see you know
[27:23] sister olivia she could tell us all
[27:25] about it right she could tell us about
[27:26] hitting the mark
[27:28] yeah right this is yup
[27:31] yup sitting on the back row looking
[27:34] really embarrassed right about now
[27:37] already to god brother trevor doesn't
[27:38] usually pick on the people in the back
[27:40] row he usually picks on zach in the
[27:41] front row
[27:42] and then the pastor's over here and then
[27:45] yeah maybe brother luis will get some
[27:46] but i ain't picking on this too because
[27:48] boy that's going to hurt later so sorry
[27:51] olivia so so olivia can tell you after
[27:53] service about hitting a mark
[27:55] and the farther back you get you know
[27:57] the smaller that mark gets
[27:58] that's kind of interesting you know when
[28:00] you get farther away that mark is small
[28:02] but when you get closer and closer and
[28:03] closer that mark gets bigger and bigger
[28:05] and
[28:05] it starts to look a whole lot better
[28:06] doesn't it doesn't it
[28:11] and so the closer and closer you get to
[28:13] christ you start recognizing that mark
[28:16] that's getting a whole lot better i
[28:17] might actually hit that thing
[28:20] because back here that mark's awful tiny
[28:25] yeah but guess what happens you see
[28:27] because we want to know like wait
[28:28] brother trevor i get
[28:30] you know we sure theologically we
[28:32] understand what you're saying like
[28:33] purpose brings joy and all that that's
[28:34] that's nice i appreciate that
[28:36] you know it's like like a school teacher
[28:38] right now or something i don't know but
[28:39] but i don't really feel it so let's just
[28:42] break it down for just a moment
[28:43] so so when sister olivia you know she
[28:47] she doesn't just i'm going to win an
[28:49] archery tournament
[28:50] because she saw bow and arrow
[28:55] no she's got to do something doesn't she
[28:57] what you got to do
[28:59] got to practice got to practice gotta
[29:01] practice and the reason you're
[29:02] practicing is because at some
[29:04] some point in time you want to become
[29:05] something right you want to she's like
[29:07] stop talking to me like goodness sakes
[29:09] but
[29:09] at some point in time you want to become
[29:13] something
[29:15] what is it you would like to become
[29:16] through the use of your practicing
[29:23] i'm going to guess that you want to be a
[29:24] good archer
[29:27] yeah and so i'm practicing because
[29:29] because you know to be a good archer
[29:32] well there's a definition of what that
[29:34] is you know if the mark is over there
[29:36] and you go whap
[29:40] that brother is a bad archer and you
[29:42] should be nowhere near
[29:44] he is so bad you see there's a
[29:48] definition of what a good archer is
[29:50] the good archer is the one that gets
[29:52] back here pulls it back
[29:55] real steady flexes the shoulder a little
[29:58] bit
[29:59] the arrow goes and it hits the mark
[30:05] and the smaller the mark is and the more
[30:07] centrally they hit the mark
[30:09] and the farther back they get in can't
[30:11] hit it guess what that means
[30:14] they're good at it
[30:20] olivia you like being good at it
[30:25] is that boring
[30:29] i bet you're real happy when you hit the
[30:31] mark and you win a tournament right
[30:36] i bet you there's some like joy
[30:40] in your heart because you recognize
[30:43] that that though it was hard that though
[30:46] some competition sometimes was stiff
[30:49] that i had to spend time in practice i
[30:52] had to put
[30:52] i had to put effort into it but yet i
[30:55] recognized
[30:56] that that there was a trophy there there
[30:58] was there was a martin
[30:59] and the trophy man it doesn't like
[31:02] they're plastic they cost
[31:03] 15 at you know bob's awards store
[31:07] like who cares but what does the trophy
[31:10] symbolize
[31:12] okay maybe you get the one that's got
[31:14] marble on the bottom so it's heavy but
[31:16] that's the only reason it's still
[31:17] plastic
[31:19] and maybe that one costs 60 good for you
[31:22] looks the same as the 15 one when it
[31:24] sits on the shelf now you're just
[31:26] putting more stress on the studs
[31:30] but what does the trophy mean the trophy
[31:34] is a symbol
[31:36] that you conquered that you achieved
[31:39] something
[31:41] a mark that that you practiced and that
[31:44] there was something that you attained
[31:46] and so when you get the trophy at the
[31:48] regionals you know then you go on
[31:50] to to compete in state and then you
[31:52] begin to compete in nationals
[31:54] and then you get to compete at world and
[31:56] guess what every time you're like man i
[31:58] thought things were great when i run
[31:59] regionals but then when i won state boy
[32:01] that was a party
[32:02] man that was amazing and then you go on
[32:04] and you win in the nation
[32:06] what did it take it took more effort it
[32:09] took more
[32:10] practice it took a pressing into that
[32:12] more and more and
[32:14] more but at each stage that they got to
[32:16] the joy was increased
[32:22] until you know some point in time two or
[32:25] three years later the trophy sitting
[32:27] there you're going i can't even remember
[32:28] what that felt like but guess what
[32:30] it isn't like that with jesus christ
[32:33] but we'll spend time pressing to get to
[32:35] that joy to get to that purpose to get
[32:37] to that definition to say
[32:39] i'm good at this but then jesus christ
[32:41] and
[32:42] who gives joy and it's not just a trophy
[32:44] on the shelf but it's an eternal joy
[32:46] that he places doubt on your heart
[32:48] it's a hope and a peace and an assurance
[32:51] and just an
[32:51] absolute bliss in jesus christ
[32:55] and we're like well but you know he gave
[32:56] me the holy ghost and i'm
[32:58] i mean i'm just coming to church now
[33:03] and then we wonder like these presses
[33:06] mark sermons are just
[33:08] old that's why i'm not telling you to
[33:11] press
[33:13] if what i can do is tell you what the
[33:15] mark is if what i can do is aspire
[33:17] inspire you
[33:18] that the mark is so much higher than you
[33:20] then then maybe you're letting it be
[33:22] right now
[33:22] then you'll be you'll just you'll look
[33:24] and go wow that's amazing and i want
[33:27] that
[33:27] and it'll give you purpose it'll give
[33:29] you joy when it gives you joy it'll give
[33:30] you strength
[33:31] to to achieve the purpose that god wants
[33:34] to use you for
[33:35] because god wants zach in his johnston
[33:38] murphys
[33:39] i'm not real sure they're justin
[33:40] murphy's but they kind of look like it
[33:43] but he wants zach to walk around
[33:46] and manifest and represent jesus christ
[33:49] to this dying generation
[33:51] and god wants you to do it and he
[33:52] doesn't want oh we're going to get there
[33:54] man maybe i'll get to my notes i don't
[33:56] know
[33:58] maybe we try to keep this logically
[34:00] oriented we can
[34:02] then you all know what i'm saying here
[34:08] so when's the last time you pressed
[34:13] when's the last time you could say
[34:14] brother trevor i i've been pressing
[34:18] lately
[34:20] oh don't preach tonight sermon brother
[34:22] trevor just keep that back
[34:24] keep that back what time is it and what
[34:27] time we got here
[34:28] 11 okay because we got to have lunch
[34:31] i was instructed
[34:35] yes what do you got
[35:00] just a little bit there
[35:04] you're welcome are we happy in the lord
[35:08] praise the lord are we happy in the
[35:10] technology
[35:11] okay so the problem is you know that we
[35:15] have sometimes
[35:16] is is because to the people here who are
[35:19] saying like i like what this brother's
[35:20] preaching and that's all great and
[35:22] there's some people are like yeah i
[35:23] still
[35:24] he hadn't got me yet he hadn't convinced
[35:25] me yet because what he's telling me
[35:28] is that i'll never achieve paul never
[35:30] achieved man and that just sounds you
[35:32] know
[35:33] what he's telling me is that i never get
[35:36] to take my foot off the gas that i never
[35:37] get to
[35:38] stop and enjoy and smell the flowers
[35:40] that's i think that's being strict but
[35:43] i'm not saying that there's not periods
[35:44] of time where we
[35:46] rest and we rejuvenate we rest in christ
[35:49] anyway
[35:49] you know maybe somebody's thinking you
[35:52] know this is just a carrot on the stick
[35:54] brother trevor that's the problem with
[35:55] you
[35:56] with you preachers you just tear it out
[35:59] trying to get us all motivated
[36:01] we're not good enough then we'll keep
[36:03] coming back to church and paying our
[36:04] time
[36:08] you know so if you ever get us to the
[36:10] place where we truly attain this whole
[36:11] christian
[36:12] thing we don't need you anymore and then
[36:13] you're out of a job and praise god
[36:15] that's what i want to do is preach
[36:16] myself out of a job
[36:18] man let's go church
[36:20] [Applause]
[36:24] but is it a carrot on a stick wait so
[36:27] what you're telling me
[36:29] if you think it's a carrot on the stick
[36:30] what you're telling me like is your god
[36:31] so small
[36:33] that you think like that someone can
[36:34] just dangle just a little bit more out
[36:36] there and just a little bit more out
[36:37] there is just a little bit more out
[36:38] there is your god so amazing that
[36:40] it's obvious to you that he can never
[36:42] fully be attained
[36:44] because your god is so big and your god
[36:45] is so great your god is so wonderful
[36:47] he's righteous he's holy he's just
[36:50] why do you want to go to the millennium
[36:52] you ever think about that
[36:54] what do you want a millennium
[36:57] i mean other than cheesecake and unsweet
[37:00] arnold palmer i know that's probably
[37:01] just
[37:01] just absolute blasphemy down here but
[37:06] but you know cheesecake and unsweet
[37:07] arnold palmer sounds real good in the
[37:08] millennium to me
[37:10] you know what is that what we want in
[37:13] the millennium oh yeah and no covered
[37:16] no masks you know no sickness no death
[37:19] that's all sounding real good this is
[37:20] so let me let me ask you this if i could
[37:22] create a place right now we could all
[37:23] get on a bus and go go to it
[37:25] and i could create a place that and it's
[37:27] wonderful
[37:28] there's no tears there's no sickness
[37:29] dying covered masks and and and you know
[37:32] and and mascaras you know people yelling
[37:35] at you and all that
[37:36] you know lovely people going to be there
[37:39] and you got
[37:40] all the rest you want all the cheesecake
[37:41] you want and what's your favorite food
[37:43] bob cheesecake so
[37:46] praise god we're going to have
[37:48] fellowship
[37:51] and nice uh i don't know it's we're a
[37:55] little bit farther down south maybe we
[37:56] need 80 degree days or something
[37:57] 75 80 degrees somewhere in there pretty
[38:00] good for you guys
[38:01] we'll just keep it that how many want to
[38:04] go
[38:06] we got a bus we're going home we want to
[38:07] go everyone okay great we'll well we'll
[38:09] set it up we'll just all we'll just all
[38:11] go and we'll leave with this old past
[38:12] house and
[38:13] just one small caveat i just feel like i
[38:15] probably better tell you jesus won't be
[38:16] there but it'll everything else will be
[38:18] great
[38:19] but jesus won't be there how many want
[38:20] to go
[38:24] just one person at least she's honest
[38:32] do we have to up the ante i mean what is
[38:34] it what's what's missing
[38:36] everything that's everything that you
[38:37] want that that's great can be there
[38:39] just know jesus like but you still don't
[38:41] want to go what are you what are you
[38:42] talking about
[38:44] oh so then then we recognize that
[38:48] everything
[38:49] truly like the reason you want to go if
[38:52] you think about it for a moment
[38:54] the reason you want to go to the
[38:55] millennium is because
[38:57] everything that is good that will be
[38:59] there everything that's lovely
[39:01] everything that's fun that's enjoyable
[39:03] that's righteous and
[39:04] just and and healthy
[39:08] why is it there because the character of
[39:11] god
[39:11] put it there it's the character of
[39:14] christ that's expressed in an
[39:16] age in a land in a time that will we
[39:19] will be
[39:20] everything that christ is is exactly
[39:22] what you want
[39:29] yeah i think he's worth pressing into
[39:33] because that's what i won he said
[39:36] brother trevor
[39:38] cheesecake is in jesus christ absolutely
[39:42] absolutely because he created it
[39:47] everything that's good everything that's
[39:49] lovely
[39:51] virtuous righteous and just
[39:54] is found in jesus christ is he not worth
[39:58] pressing into
[39:59] man yeah i think he is
[40:03] i think because i think if you're truly
[40:05] honest with yourself and like we just
[40:07] went through this little exercise
[40:09] you're saying that you won't go to a
[40:10] millennium without him
[40:15] well then why would you seek after
[40:17] anything but him here
[40:19] if that's what you're seeking after and
[40:20] what you want to go into there
[40:22] why wouldn't you be doing it now because
[40:24] he died on the cross
[40:25] he bridged the gap and you can get back
[40:27] into fellowship with him
[40:30] every day for the believer ought to have
[40:32] just a little piece of the millennium
[40:33] now now don't misunderstand me and think
[40:35] that i think we're in the millennium now
[40:37] because
[40:37] goodness no i'm not there all right but
[40:40] i'm saying you should have such a
[40:42] relationship with jesus christ
[40:44] you there's so much more of him to get
[40:46] than
[40:47] the average church-going believer ever
[40:50] attains to
[40:51] and god is telling us hey it's almost
[40:53] time to go
[40:54] why do you sit here half asleep when
[40:57] there's so much that you can have
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:02] and well we say well you know we we love
[41:04] that quote we're living we're living a
[41:06] million miles below our privileges
[41:10] amen we all know it we all kind of hang
[41:13] our heads it's like
[41:13] you know but yet we have hope because
[41:15] it's like well we have more privileges
[41:16] than we have right now i just wish
[41:18] we could get into it you know and and
[41:20] zach when you
[41:21] you know when you wanted the privilege
[41:22] of driving the car
[41:26] what was the what was that one word that
[41:29] that your father would be like yeah i
[41:31] just don't know if you have enough
[41:34] yet
[41:39] responsibility did you have to hear that
[41:42] in the back from them whispering or did
[41:43] you
[41:44] anyway
[41:47] we're living a million miles below our
[41:49] privileges
[41:51] young people you wanted a dog at your
[41:52] house you wanted a cat you wanted a pet
[41:54] a bird a fish a
[41:55] lizard i don't know what these days it's
[41:57] kind of crazy maybe a little pig
[42:01] and your parents said i don't know
[42:03] because i don't want to feed it
[42:04] oh i'll feed it i'll take care of it
[42:06] yeah i'm just not sure that you're ready
[42:08] for the responsibility
[42:09] that that privilege entails so if we're
[42:13] living a million miles below our
[42:14] privileges zach
[42:15] what are we living also a million miles
[42:17] below
[42:20] responsibility yes responsibility we're
[42:23] living a million miles below our
[42:24] responsibility sometimes why
[42:26] because we stopped pressing the reason
[42:28] we stopped pressing is not because we're
[42:30] bad people
[42:30] it's not because we don't love jesus but
[42:32] we allowed the mark to come down to a
[42:34] low point
[42:35] where we said well i attained it and i'm
[42:37] good but paul said i count not
[42:40] myself to have apprehended
[42:45] well glory to god so we we begin to lift
[42:49] the mark up
[42:51] we begin to lift the mark up and that
[42:52] produces action in us that produces
[42:54] that produces a calling in us that
[42:56] produces a oh there
[42:58] is more that's great there's something
[43:01] for me to do
[43:04] you know how you know how zack feels
[43:05] when i tell him
[43:07] you know what god wants to use you god
[43:08] needs you god needs you in those
[43:10] johnston murphys man to go
[43:13] yeah you know how he feels
[43:16] if he's right with the lord and you know
[43:17] if he doesn't have to be like oh i
[43:19] cannot go do some repenting
[43:20] you know which
[43:24] do you know how it feels when he's told
[43:26] god needs you
[43:28] god wants to use you and your gifting
[43:30] and your calling
[43:31] to to to take this world for him to show
[43:34] and
[43:35] and maybe you'll think you you aren't
[43:36] even being effective but he still wants
[43:38] to use you
[43:38] do you know how zack feels zach stands a
[43:40] little straighter
[43:42] his shoulders round back just a little
[43:44] bit he's like yes
[43:46] lord ah once there's me
[43:50] i'm desired i'm needed right
[43:53] i'm called and it's personal
[43:58] yeah that feels good i like that
[44:03] i'm needed for something i'm not
[44:05] worthless
[44:07] and it's not just theology it's not just
[44:09] no yeah you're not worthless jesus died
[44:11] for you and you go yay jesus died for me
[44:13] yeah but he also poured himself out as
[44:15] the holy spirit
[44:17] and to live inside of you to to work
[44:19] inside of you when he needs you and you
[44:20] go oh hey hey
[44:22] hey this just got cool man
[44:28] and so you stand up a little straighter
[44:30] you begin to have joy because you start
[44:31] hitting the mark maybe it was just 20
[44:33] yards for a while but then you got to 30
[44:35] then you got to 40 then you got to 50
[44:36] then you started winning awards and
[44:38] man because i'm hitting the mark every
[44:39] time and then and i'm taking the
[44:41] responsibility and i'm pressing in i'm
[44:43] learning how to hit that mark and i'm
[44:45] studying my bible and i'm down on my
[44:47] knees in prayer and i'm hitting that
[44:48] mark because i've set that mark high
[44:50] and and it's getting greater every
[44:51] single time all the all the time and man
[44:54] i felt good
[44:55] you know 20 years ago and well i guess
[44:57] the lord maybe called me to be a
[44:58] preacher and i lead some bible studies
[45:00] or something like that we had some
[45:01] amazing times and
[45:02] let me tell you what i am really
[45:04] enjoying traveling and preaching
[45:08] it feels good man i love serving the
[45:11] lord
[45:13] absolutely it feels great
[45:19] i told my son one time i said you know
[45:21] what i said um because we were talking
[45:23] about
[45:24] you know it's it's difficult sometimes
[45:26] you know i i i got a full-time job i'm a
[45:28] web developer you know
[45:29] that's a field that changes all the time
[45:31] you got to kind of
[45:32] study and learn some things and try to
[45:34] keep up with things and how this all
[45:35] works or you're going to get behind and
[45:37] you know so you got to kind of do this
[45:41] and then but yet
[45:42] here i'm a minister too and i got to
[45:43] study the word and i got to learn all of
[45:45] this kind of thing and you know you
[45:46] gotta
[45:47] divide your time sometimes and i said i
[45:50] said you know what but i didn't
[45:51] i didn't become you know i said guess
[45:53] why
[45:54] i travel to norway and preach well
[45:58] it's not because i'm just so break them
[46:00] or other like no it no because i've
[46:02] i've studied i've put in the time
[46:06] i've practiced i've spoken before people
[46:09] little by little pressing in pressing in
[46:12] pressing in why why am i doing that
[46:13] not because i'm something great no it's
[46:15] because god put a gift in my life and
[46:17] pretty much can't do anything but but
[46:19] you know
[46:20] but at the same time and there's times
[46:23] when man
[46:24] i mean you know it's like look this is
[46:26] the great part like evangelists we live
[46:27] the good life
[46:29] you know pastors god bless you brother
[46:33] burden bearer you know got the whole
[46:36] world on his shoulders
[46:38] i was telling my son the other day i
[46:39] said you know what as a minister i said
[46:41] sometimes
[46:42] you know when you're doing more of the
[46:44] pastor type stuff and
[46:45] not just traveling the world preaching
[46:47] but you know getting down and having to
[46:49] actually help people and deal with
[46:50] people and not just stir up the church
[46:52] and then
[46:53] light it on fire and leave you know like
[46:55] people begin to tell you
[46:56] absolutely terrible things that you can
[46:58] tell no one
[47:01] that ain't easy man that's not easy at
[47:05] all
[47:06] we hear things that are just wait what
[47:09] no
[47:10] no that didn't happen no that oh my
[47:12] goodness
[47:13] oh goodness jesus help me because i i
[47:15] don't even know how to handle hearing
[47:16] about that let alone
[47:17] these people just went through that so
[47:20] it's hard
[47:22] but yet as you grow you recognize
[47:24] there's things that are hard
[47:26] there's also things that are just
[47:27] amazing then when you're sitting there
[47:29] and you're making breakthroughs and
[47:30] you're helping someone under christ and
[47:31] you're like god you did this
[47:33] you did this i mean you needed me to put
[47:35] in the time you needed me to put in the
[47:37] work it doesn't just happen
[47:38] but i put in the work and suddenly you
[47:40] know people from you know
[47:42] around the world actually want to hear
[47:43] me speak
[47:45] that's just weird
[47:48] i mean truly you know the little guy
[47:50] inside of me that's like you know kind
[47:52] of insecure
[47:52] trevor you know he's like what never
[47:55] thought that would have happened
[47:56] you know hey
[47:59] why because the mark is high
[48:02] right it didn't stop we didn't stop we
[48:06] keep pressing because it's high
[48:09] and so while there's burdens there's
[48:11] also great great great blessings
[48:15] you know because somebody's going to
[48:16] come up to me after service and say i
[48:17] absolutely needed that brother trevor
[48:19] i've been down and i've been to you know
[48:20] and
[48:20] man i've been you know and then two
[48:21] years later like brother trevor like you
[48:23] remember you pressed the mark i'm like
[48:24] you remember me preaching
[48:25] you remember the title like my jesus
[48:28] that must have made an impact you
[48:29] remembered something from two years ago
[48:30] that's crazy man
[48:32] and you know how you feel it feels good
[48:36] and i love it i love it i don't take the
[48:39] glory but i'm just like no but that's
[48:41] okay i love it thank you
[48:42] that's very encouraging i appreciate
[48:44] that i'm glad the lord used me to help
[48:46] you
[48:49] there's great joy in that and the
[48:52] privileges have raised
[48:54] as i've put the responsibility in and
[48:57] god wants the same for you
[48:59] he doesn't want you to just sit there
[49:00] and go well i'm a message believer now
[49:01] yay
[49:03] there's more there's more than it but
[49:05] brother trevor i'm not a preacher like
[49:06] nobody's going to call me from around
[49:08] the world to have me preach that's fine
[49:09] god has
[49:10] asked you to do something right
[49:13] we'll talk about that here in a little
[49:14] bit if we don't get till noon
[49:18] so so the problem is is what we what we
[49:21] end up
[49:22] doing is when we when we begin to feel
[49:24] like we arrived
[49:26] and you know sometimes there's an
[49:27] absolute progression you know you you
[49:28] know maybe somebody comes into the
[49:30] message
[49:30] and and they just begin to go wow this
[49:32] is so amazing there's so much revelation
[49:34] there's seals there's churches ages and
[49:36] and thunders and all of these things and
[49:37] i get to understand and you study and
[49:39] you know it's great and then you get to
[49:41] this you know kind of peak to where at
[49:42] some point in time you
[49:44] you generally understand the seals and
[49:46] you generally understand the church ages
[49:47] and the trumpets and these things and
[49:49] you
[49:49] you know yeah brother madam said this
[49:50] and this and you know i get the i get
[49:52] the general picture i kind of understand
[49:54] i never did before but i do now and it's
[49:56] great i love it you know and that's
[49:58] you know and so then you kind of you
[49:59] know plateau
[50:01] yeah and you know because well
[50:04] some of that newness is worn off some of
[50:06] that super revelation that you feel like
[50:08] you never had has kind of well i
[50:10] actually got that revelation now and so
[50:12] so you know you went from this stage and
[50:14] of of newness and the problem is some
[50:17] people can't
[50:17] they can't live without that feeling and
[50:19] so they got to come up with crazy
[50:21] doctrines so that they can
[50:22] still be super revelated because they
[50:24] just enjoyed that feeling so much so you
[50:26] can watch out for that
[50:28] but then some people just kind of plain
[50:30] out and it's like well i get it now like
[50:32] i'm
[50:33] basically arrived in message
[50:34] understanding and so what do i do now
[50:38] well now that god has given you the
[50:39] tools that you need why don't you do
[50:41] something with them
[50:42] that's that's what it is but the problem
[50:44] is is that we begin
[50:46] amen problem is that we begin to look
[50:49] around and we begin to see what the
[50:50] message culture around us is doing
[50:53] and and because you know well maybe i
[50:55] don't really want to keep pressing
[50:56] because maybe that responsibility
[50:58] doesn't sound so great and i don't
[50:59] really want to do that and i don't
[51:01] i'm not truly convinced that when i put
[51:02] in all this effort that there's really
[51:04] going to be
[51:04] that much joy coming back so i'm just
[51:06] going to kind of sit here
[51:08] and i'm going to look but i still feel
[51:09] like i need to do something
[51:11] you know because i need to feel good for
[51:12] christ and so what we begin to do is say
[51:15] well me and my message culture and this
[51:17] little church and the few churches that
[51:18] we
[51:19] agree with you know we we kind of all
[51:21] get it but you know there's some people
[51:22] that understand things differently than
[51:24] we do
[51:25] and so so you know what we're going to
[51:27] do is we're going to have to
[51:28] we're going to have to do something
[51:29] about them
[51:33] because because that's way more
[51:34] convenient than doing something about
[51:36] you
[51:37] i mean
[51:40] you know what i'm learning yeah people
[51:43] don't want character
[51:45] character is a victory not a gift you're
[51:47] gonna have to go through a little
[51:47] suffering negate character people do not
[51:49] want it they want jesus like
[51:50] look lord i'm praying you just come fix
[51:52] this because i don't want to have to go
[51:53] through this situation and have
[51:54] character on the other end of it
[51:56] you just fix it supernaturally lord
[51:58] because
[52:00] i ain't going through that and see the
[52:03] process of character development the
[52:04] process of you
[52:05] pressing on into christ it's it's not
[52:07] always easy it's not always fun and so
[52:09] it would be so much easier if we can
[52:10] recognize that i've attained but i see
[52:13] those other people over there they
[52:14] haven't attained
[52:15] and if jesus is going to use me he's
[52:16] going to use me to help get them in
[52:19] because their message is e-ness
[52:22] isn't messaging-ness enough
[52:25] we are we are writer message than
[52:29] they are and so we we we must be used by
[52:32] god
[52:34] and so you know we took we i preached
[52:36] this sermon
[52:37] and this was a perfect story because
[52:39] this literally happened just before we
[52:40] preached this
[52:41] before i preached the sermon it's like i
[52:42] love it when god gives me
[52:44] a story on saturday to use in the sermon
[52:47] on sunday
[52:48] that's great and so we we we were um
[52:52] we were in south carolina we were at
[52:54] this brother's house he lives out in the
[52:55] country he's got this
[52:56] i think it's a blue heather it's a sheep
[52:58] dog kind of a kind of a dog
[53:00] and they're all laughing and everything
[53:01] and they're like oh i bet you he's gonna
[53:02] get brother trevor today and i was like
[53:04] what are you talking about it's like
[53:05] well that dog you know he's a sheepdog
[53:07] what does sheepdog do they nip
[53:09] they nip at the heels to keep the sheep
[53:10] together that's what their
[53:13] instinct is it's what they're trained to
[53:14] do and so apparently this dog though
[53:16] he's just
[53:17] you know they said you know he can be
[53:19] just out in the yard he can be 100 yards
[53:21] away
[53:22] and you think man there's no way and you
[53:25] you
[53:26] you go up the steps and you turn to walk
[53:28] in the door and that dog will come out
[53:29] of nowhere
[53:30] and get you in the heel before you get
[53:32] in the door and i was like i don't know
[53:34] what we're going to do here
[53:36] because it would be it would be a shame
[53:38] to have to kill a killer brother's dog
[53:39] before you preach to him
[53:41] the day before you know the next day
[53:42] like this i just don't know how that
[53:43] would work
[53:44] but if that dog nips me he's that will
[53:46] be his last nip like i'm
[53:49] i better not feel it
[53:52] so then they're like well we should go
[53:53] on a walk it's a beautiful day let's go
[53:55] on a walk down the country road okay
[53:57] let's go on a walk that sounds nice the
[53:58] dog came
[54:04] right like what are you doing like is
[54:06] there a chain
[54:07] like with you know the dog wasn't
[54:10] leashed
[54:11] you know we're in the country it just no
[54:13] and so
[54:14] you know we're like what are we gonna do
[54:15] this dog is you know i mean and guess
[54:17] what the dog is doing he's like
[54:23] what's he's looking for you know i said
[54:25] look
[54:27] sweetie kids stay in the middle
[54:31] is that dog's looking for outliers he is
[54:34] trained to keep people in a group
[54:37] so don't get out of the group and we
[54:39] won't get nipped by this dog
[54:42] and all will be well and and even though
[54:44] we were in the group but we're still
[54:45] watching this we're walking down the
[54:46] road
[54:47] yeah i'm watching you
[54:52] the most uncomfortable walk down the
[54:53] country road i have ever had in my
[54:54] entire life
[54:58] but i realized something we're message
[55:00] sheepdogs sometimes
[55:03] we're message sheepdogs we're like no yo
[55:04] you're not in the right here you gotta
[55:07] you gotta you know we nippy nippy nip
[55:08] try to get you over in our church or
[55:10] nippy nippy nip try to get you over into
[55:11] our understanding and
[55:12] you know we want other message people to
[55:14] be in our message
[55:15] understanding and rightness and things
[55:17] like that and you know none of us can
[55:19] actually think well praise god you know
[55:21] hey maybe i'm the one that's wrong we
[55:24] don't do that well
[55:26] you know what i tell tell brothers
[55:27] usually as brothers that you know when
[55:29] we're disagreeing
[55:31] i say well there's one of three
[55:33] possibilities here
[55:34] and i always start with this one because
[55:36] then you know they always agree with it
[55:38] first it's always nice to
[55:39] start with something somebody can agree
[55:40] with and i say look we have one of three
[55:42] possibilities i'm wrong
[55:44] you're wrong we're both wrong
[55:48] like it's just logic it's okay
[55:52] yeah maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm trying to
[55:55] get people this is
[55:56] gonna lose something there we go maybe
[55:57] i'm trying to get people and i'm trying
[55:59] to be a message sheepdog but i'm wrong
[56:02] man that's a problem
[56:06] that's not what god is asking us to do
[56:08] right it's like oh you feel like you
[56:10] obtained go get other people and get the
[56:11] same level of your attainment no the
[56:13] problem isn't
[56:14] the problem the problem isn't whether
[56:15] you've attained or not the problem is
[56:17] you set the mark low
[56:18] and so you're like well now that i'm
[56:19] here i gotta i have nothing else to do
[56:21] so
[56:22] i'm gonna go meddle in other people's
[56:23] lives and try to get them into the same
[56:24] low mark that i got to
[56:30] no no why don't we set the mark a lot
[56:33] higher
[56:34] why don't we set the mark a lot harder
[56:35] here let me read you this quote because
[56:36] i love this quote this is great
[56:38] it's just great because it makes no
[56:42] sense
[56:44] like it does but it at first when you
[56:46] when you read it i'm like no this isn't
[56:47] it can't be this way brother bram says
[56:50] in the sudden
[56:50] secret go into the way of the church
[56:51] it's not up to the branham tabernacle
[56:53] neither it is up to any other church
[56:54] it's up to you as an individual to be
[56:57] ready at the coming of the lord
[56:59] you must be ready i must be ready
[57:03] i'll sweep my own steps it's up to you
[57:06] to sweep your steps
[57:08] leave mine alone me leave yours alone
[57:10] you've got to make your garment ready
[57:14] you say brother trevor why doesn't that
[57:15] make sense well does does that
[57:19] yeah yeah go to the next one there yeah
[57:23] how about that attitude i'll sweep my
[57:26] own steps
[57:27] it's up to you to sweep your own steps
[57:29] leave mine alone
[57:31] i'll leave yours alone
[57:36] mind your own business no
[57:40] get out of my business i'll get out like
[57:41] that's christian right i mean that's
[57:42] what we do as christians we stay out of
[57:44] each other's business and
[57:45] you know we just say look get your steps
[57:47] ready because i'm over here getting rid
[57:48] of
[57:48] taking care of mine and that doesn't
[57:50] sound caring that doesn't sound loving
[57:51] that doesn't sound
[57:52] like how does that work because the
[57:54] problem is is you set the mark low and
[57:56] you begin to meddle over there
[57:58] and and and your steps ain't clean
[58:02] because the mark that you set was so low
[58:05] that it doesn't matter whether your
[58:06] steps were clean or not
[58:08] so let's talk about sweeping your steps
[58:09] what happens when you begin to sweep
[58:11] your steps and
[58:11] if we're concerned about others what we
[58:13] really ought to do is start working on
[58:15] me
[58:16] because here's what happens you know you
[58:17] start sweeping your steps you know you
[58:19] get out and you're like well man the
[58:20] steps are dirty maybe i should clean
[58:22] them
[58:22] and you start sweeping your steps and
[58:24] it's dangerous to start sweeping your
[58:25] steps we'll talk about why that is later
[58:27] but you start sweeping your steps and
[58:28] you know maybe you get the dvds out of
[58:30] the door
[58:31] you get the cds you shouldn't have mp3s
[58:33] sorry let me update it to 2021
[58:35] and you get you know or maybe you get
[58:37] the rights you know
[58:38] playlists on spotify here we go now
[58:40] we're in 2021
[58:41] and and or pandora whichever i don't
[58:44] know am i missing any
[58:45] okay we continue on and you start
[58:46] sweeping the things you know in just
[58:48] down the outside in your
[58:50] life you know maybe you get rid of sorry
[58:52] i said dvds forgive me
[58:53] maybe you get rid of your netflix
[58:55] account you know or
[58:56] you know or you get a filter for your
[58:58] disney plus
[58:59] i don't know yeah or
[59:03] you know maybe everybody got that step
[59:04] clean already good i love that
[59:06] so great or not
[59:10] okay so you start sweeping the steps and
[59:11] there's things that you just shouldn't
[59:13] have you know
[59:14] and maybe you know maybe you get rid of
[59:16] the scissors and maybe you get rid of
[59:17] the
[59:18] you know the tight this and the tight
[59:21] that
[59:21] and you know you get the yeah them
[59:23] little skin down wiener skirts out
[59:26] sweeping the steps sweeping the steps
[59:28] sweeping the step man we meddling today
[59:30] okay sweep the steps and you get that
[59:33] first step clean
[59:34] and you go my that looks like a nice
[59:36] step
[59:38] well there's probably three or four more
[59:40] don't stop there
[59:41] but i got all the like the stuff like
[59:44] man the stuff that you evangelists come
[59:45] and preach about and tell us to get rid
[59:47] of like netflix like
[59:48] you know i got rid of it okay what do
[59:50] you want me to do
[59:52] i did the thing i'm good now right
[59:55] because i've conformed
[59:56] to what you said i should be doing to be
[59:59] a good message believer
[1:00:00] i have attained the mark no once you
[1:00:03] step look the mud comes
[1:00:05] the mud comes from the ground up like
[1:00:07] the outside that first step you know
[1:00:09] that's just the physical manifestation
[1:00:10] of the dirt so why don't we step down
[1:00:12] into your heart just a little bit
[1:00:13] and start thinking about why was it that
[1:00:15] the preacher even had to tell me
[1:00:17] i should get rid of some of this stuff
[1:00:19] well maybe it's because the condition of
[1:00:21] my heart isn't right maybe it's because
[1:00:22] i desire some of those things and i
[1:00:24] gotta really get down and
[1:00:25] man that second step it's a doozy like
[1:00:26] that's that that's a real
[1:00:28] sometimes you know the stringer isn't
[1:00:30] right and that last step is a real big
[1:00:31] one
[1:00:32] you know so you really fall down that
[1:00:34] one and you get there and you're like
[1:00:35] wow this is crazy and i'm sweeping this
[1:00:36] step
[1:00:37] and i'm actually getting my heart right
[1:00:38] and people don't like to do that because
[1:00:40] that's
[1:00:41] well it's hard that's right it don't
[1:00:44] feel good
[1:00:45] it's not fun well till it's over and
[1:00:47] then you go man i cannot believe and
[1:00:49] how many how many would testify and say
[1:00:51] you know there's things that god has
[1:00:53] brought me out of that five years ago i
[1:00:54] thought i'd never get out of that
[1:00:56] but now you're out of that and you look
[1:00:57] at it back there and five years ago and
[1:00:58] you go
[1:00:59] what on earth i cannot believe i ever
[1:01:02] struggled with that
[1:01:03] how did i ever think that was okay
[1:01:08] come on somebody so then what are the
[1:01:10] things that you're dealing with today
[1:01:12] that the preachers are like yeah you
[1:01:13] should get
[1:01:13] rid of this and you're like man but i
[1:01:14] don't know like i like that thing
[1:01:16] think about that thing that you got rid
[1:01:18] of five years ago that you're thinking
[1:01:19] that was stupid how could i ever do it
[1:01:21] maybe that'll help you because there's
[1:01:24] probably more of that and then five
[1:01:25] years from now you'll be like well he
[1:01:26] was right
[1:01:27] i'm so glad i got rid of that like i bet
[1:01:29] everybody thought i was heathen
[1:01:32] well we knew that there was grace
[1:01:33] because we were heathens too
[1:01:35] all right praise god we love each other
[1:01:37] okay so you get down on that next step
[1:01:38] you start sweeping
[1:01:40] and then man this guess what there's two
[1:01:42] more steps and you keep dropping down
[1:01:44] and getting down
[1:01:45] closer to the heart closer to that's
[1:01:47] when it really gets easy
[1:01:49] i mean not easy but really really hard
[1:01:50] because guess what there's more dirt
[1:01:52] down there because you're you know
[1:01:53] you're closer to the dirt the ground and
[1:01:56] that's when you know somebody steps
[1:01:57] right there gets all the mud the first
[1:01:59] step gets most of it
[1:02:00] second step gets a little bit less third
[1:02:02] step four step
[1:02:03] right so it's easier to clip the clean
[1:02:05] the top steps and then as you get down
[1:02:06] into the heart it's harder to get those
[1:02:07] steps clean and
[1:02:08] you know maybe you got to get a little
[1:02:09] shovel flat flat
[1:02:11] scrape that just a little bit and then
[1:02:12] get it nice and clean
[1:02:15] and you finally get your clean steps you
[1:02:16] know instead of worrying about you know
[1:02:17] your other your neighbor's steps you
[1:02:19] just actually start worrying about your
[1:02:20] steps and you think well
[1:02:22] that's isn't that selfish no because
[1:02:24] because here's the hard part here's
[1:02:25] what's going to happen next
[1:02:29] somebody's going to see your steps
[1:02:32] and you'll be like but i just cleaned
[1:02:34] them isn't that a good thing well maybe
[1:02:36] it depends on who it is it's all your
[1:02:38] steps because they're going to have one
[1:02:39] of two reactions the first reaction is
[1:02:40] who do you think you are
[1:02:42] you think your steps are cleaner than
[1:02:43] mine
[1:02:45] and you're like i just i
[1:02:48] took a broom and i swept my steps
[1:02:52] this was this had nothing to do with you
[1:02:58] or they look at your steps and go
[1:03:02] look at your steps look at my steps
[1:03:08] and you're like okay how's this gonna go
[1:03:13] and they go my steps are dirty
[1:03:17] because i see your steps and when i look
[1:03:20] at your steps i recognize my
[1:03:22] like i want steps like yours how'd you
[1:03:24] do that you say well i took a broom
[1:03:28] and i began to sweep amen you see when
[1:03:31] you begin to sweep your steps and you
[1:03:32] begin to
[1:03:33] really live your life others are going
[1:03:35] to notice it's going to make a reaction
[1:03:37] in others you want to help others
[1:03:39] sweep your steps you want to impact this
[1:03:41] world sweep your steps
[1:03:43] start here and then when you start here
[1:03:45] maybe that's going to impact others
[1:03:47] by just they're going to observe it
[1:03:49] they're going to see hey
[1:03:50] you set an example of clean steps and i
[1:03:53] recognize i got a little bit of work to
[1:03:55] do
[1:03:56] so i don't have to go next door to
[1:03:58] brother louise look at them steps man
[1:03:59] whoo you know you got somebody to shine
[1:04:02] my shoes after i walk into your house
[1:04:04] goodness sakes brother why don't you get
[1:04:06] with the program and become a message
[1:04:07] believer come on now somebody
[1:04:12] you don't message like i do
[1:04:18] why don't you clean your steps why don't
[1:04:20] you set the mark high
[1:04:22] and start pressing and people are either
[1:04:24] gonna love your hate you're one of the
[1:04:25] two but man
[1:04:26] you're gonna have an impact on this
[1:04:27] world so you think me sweeping my steps
[1:04:30] and me leaving your steps alone
[1:04:32] like yeah that's actually helping others
[1:04:36] that's not being that's not being
[1:04:39] selfish it's not being well well
[1:04:41] he's got a bad attitude he won't help
[1:04:42] anybody else with their steps yes he
[1:04:43] will by exposing
[1:04:46] and not for the purpose of exposing but
[1:04:47] just because my steps ought to be clean
[1:04:50] because that's pleasing to christ so god
[1:04:52] begins to use you
[1:04:54] just as you begin to to serve him and to
[1:04:56] grow in him and
[1:04:57] to be what he's calling you to be
[1:05:00] because it's a high calling
[1:05:01] that paul hadn't even apprehended and
[1:05:03] you begin to to attain and apprehend
[1:05:05] people begin to be inspired and go my
[1:05:07] goodness
[1:05:09] look look what this guy's doing look
[1:05:11] what this girl's doing
[1:05:12] that's something i ought to attain to
[1:05:17] and it makes an impact on the world
[1:05:22] so when zach cleans his steps everybody
[1:05:23] else is like yeah
[1:05:25] i might not wear johnston murphy's he
[1:05:26] might not either i'm not sure but
[1:05:29] i want to be like zach because his steps
[1:05:32] are so clean
[1:05:36] so you know another problem that we have
[1:05:40] though is
[1:05:40] is is and and
[1:05:44] 11 30 i might even try to clean no
[1:05:46] probably not but anyway
[1:05:48] i'll try to close here in 15 20 minutes
[1:05:50] all right so but but another problem
[1:05:52] that we have here is
[1:05:53] is is
[1:05:57] is we tend to group so much
[1:06:00] but god isn't calling a group to press
[1:06:03] the mark
[1:06:04] he's calling zack to press the mark he's
[1:06:06] calling bob depressed
[1:06:08] he's calling esther to press the mark
[1:06:14] he's calling you he's calling you to
[1:06:16] press the mark not this church not a
[1:06:17] group he's calling you as an individual
[1:06:19] to sweep your steps
[1:06:20] to press to the mark of the high calling
[1:06:22] that high calling for you the problem is
[1:06:24] is that we
[1:06:24] we well let me hear there's a quote
[1:06:26] there's a quote we should read that
[1:06:27] quote first
[1:06:28] where's that one is your life worthy of
[1:06:30] the gospel brother branham says
[1:06:32] a christian is not a tool or some kind
[1:06:34] of a mechanical wrench to a great big
[1:06:35] religious regime
[1:06:37] that's right a christian he he's not a
[1:06:39] tool that keeps a religious organization
[1:06:41] moving a christian that's not a
[1:06:43] christian
[1:06:44] a christians to be christ-like and a
[1:06:46] christian cannot be a christian until
[1:06:48] christ comes into that man
[1:06:50] that life of christ in him then it
[1:06:52] produces the life that christ did
[1:06:54] and you do the things that christ did
[1:06:58] you're not a tool right you didn't come
[1:07:00] into this church and just
[1:07:02] like you're look you know what
[1:07:06] if zach is a wrench and we lose zach we
[1:07:10] just get new wrench
[1:07:13] no big deal they make you know what they
[1:07:16] make wrench they they stamp them
[1:07:18] it's the same thing a wrench is a wrench
[1:07:22] is a wrench is a wrench you aren't the
[1:07:24] tool zach you're not a wrench man
[1:07:28] he's unique you're unique
[1:07:32] god wants to use you in your uniqueness
[1:07:34] so so so when when
[1:07:36] you know because otherwise what we do um
[1:07:40] we invite people to the mwti
[1:07:43] anybody ever went there mwti message
[1:07:45] witnessing um
[1:07:46] training institute
[1:07:50] you didn't know you all didn't go there
[1:07:53] well that's where you learn how to tell
[1:07:54] people how brother brandon was a prophet
[1:07:58] how else are you going to witness if you
[1:07:59] haven't learned at the mwti yeah
[1:08:01] you see you need to send all your young
[1:08:03] people to the mwti brother do you know
[1:08:04] who
[1:08:05] you know who teaches at the mwti that'd
[1:08:07] be me
[1:08:09] and guess what i got a great way for you
[1:08:11] look if you don't know how to
[1:08:12] how to tell people why we believe
[1:08:14] brother brown is a prophet straight out
[1:08:15] of the bible like look come to the mwti
[1:08:18] i'll tell you how to show people guess
[1:08:21] which way i'll tell you
[1:08:23] the way i do it why will i tell you the
[1:08:26] way i do it because i think it's best
[1:08:30] it might be but it's maybe that's the
[1:08:33] way it's best for me
[1:08:35] but i don't know if maybe it's not the
[1:08:37] way you should
[1:08:38] do it maybe there's a different way
[1:08:40] maybe there's
[1:08:41] maybe god is just calling you to live in
[1:08:43] a way now i'm not like look just just a
[1:08:46] little caveat here
[1:08:47] like we we we listen to the brother
[1:08:49] brandon talk about god's billboards and
[1:08:51] and and sometimes we think what our
[1:08:52] witnessing is is when our sisters go to
[1:08:54] the grocery store
[1:08:56] like that's a problem church that's just
[1:08:57] kind of a problem it's like well
[1:08:59] i witnessed because i wear my skirt to
[1:09:01] the grocery store
[1:09:03] okay good like but like there's probably
[1:09:06] more
[1:09:06] yeah that god is calling you to do
[1:09:09] there's probably mine
[1:09:10] like so let's let's not just take that
[1:09:12] cheap way out like
[1:09:13] go and be god's billboard at the grocery
[1:09:15] store but
[1:09:16] god probably wants more don't worry
[1:09:19] that's a good thing
[1:09:21] it'll be great so if you all come to the
[1:09:24] mwti and you learn from me here's how
[1:09:25] you witness people here's how you get
[1:09:27] them in a message here's the scriptures
[1:09:28] used and
[1:09:29] here's you know you use this one first
[1:09:30] and then this one and then you ask them
[1:09:31] this question and then you do this and
[1:09:32] then you say this and then you show them
[1:09:34] this and you go through
[1:09:35] you know all the way to revelations 3 14
[1:09:37] and 7th messenger and then you say well
[1:09:39] now flip over to revelations 10 and it's
[1:09:40] just like in the days of the voice of
[1:09:41] the
[1:09:42] seventh angels he wants first one second
[1:09:44] one's third like it's cool like that
[1:09:46] works like people get it and everybody
[1:09:48] just does that you know and then
[1:09:49] and zach learns it and esther learns it
[1:09:53] and rachel learns it we begin to see the
[1:09:55] same people at the grocery store
[1:09:58] and people begin to be like oh there's
[1:09:59] another one yeah
[1:10:02] i get it seventh angel right yeah i
[1:10:05] guess i've seen you
[1:10:07] well you've never met me before yeah i
[1:10:08] know but one of your carbon copy was
[1:10:10] here last week
[1:10:14] because if we all become the same then
[1:10:16] we're just some tool and we're
[1:10:18] replaceable god doesn't do that
[1:10:19] you're not just a tool you're not
[1:10:22] replaceable
[1:10:24] because god god made you the way he made
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:28] so so doesn't it doesn't that doesn't
[1:10:30] that bring some joy too doesn't that
[1:10:31] doesn't that bring some like yeah
[1:10:32] god wants me and he's not just saying me
[1:10:35] because like i'm a christian and i'm
[1:10:36] sitting here so who else is gonna
[1:10:38] no he wants you as an individual he
[1:10:40] loves you
[1:10:41] he desires you he gifted you he put
[1:10:44] something in your life
[1:10:45] that we need cause we need one another
[1:10:47] maybe you're an encourager maybe you're
[1:10:49] a prayer
[1:10:50] maybe you're a witness or maybe you're
[1:10:51] maybe you're an evangelist or you're a
[1:10:53] teacher you're this you're that i don't
[1:10:54] know what it is
[1:10:55] maybe you pray for your husband as you
[1:10:57] do laundry well praise god pray over
[1:10:59] that laundry
[1:11:00] whatever it is that god has called you
[1:11:02] and gifted you into doing it's important
[1:11:05] and he uniquely qualified you to do it
[1:11:08] in your specific way
[1:11:12] let's look at this other quote brother
[1:11:13] i'm talking about you know how they put
[1:11:15] the stones together
[1:11:16] in the in the temple you know and he
[1:11:18] said
[1:11:20] he said identify masterpiece of god
[1:11:23] we're always going to be that way god is
[1:11:24] not a sears and robot harmony house
[1:11:26] he's a god of variety he makes one way
[1:11:28] one one way and one another
[1:11:30] but we must serve him in the way that
[1:11:31] god made us and be glad and stay behind
[1:11:33] the word
[1:11:34] that's the way god did it and he starts
[1:11:36] to talk about out of return in jubilee
[1:11:37] he starts to talk about how they made
[1:11:39] the temple
[1:11:40] and how they cut the stones outside the
[1:11:42] temple and then brought them in and fit
[1:11:43] the stones together
[1:11:45] and sometimes you know they began to do
[1:11:46] the tetris of all the stones
[1:11:48] and then there was a you know there was
[1:11:50] like one of the stones was a little late
[1:11:52] coming
[1:11:53] so they've got all this fit together and
[1:11:54] it's like well here's this
[1:11:56] odd shape here like
[1:12:00] we got something that's got to fit that
[1:12:02] or we won't be complete
[1:12:04] and maybe these guys out here they're
[1:12:05] cutting a stone and they're like looking
[1:12:07] at this stone going
[1:12:08] that is the weirdest looking stone i've
[1:12:10] ever cut like look at how many
[1:12:12] directions that turns and moves and goes
[1:12:13] up and down it's got these little
[1:12:14] notches in it
[1:12:15] and things like that that's the weirdest
[1:12:17] looking stone ever
[1:12:18] and then but then that stone comes and
[1:12:20] it fits just right in that slot
[1:12:24] brother brahm says i think god down
[1:12:26] through this time
[1:12:27] has cut out some very odd stones that we
[1:12:30] might not have understood
[1:12:32] but they have their place exactly in the
[1:12:35] temple and the building of god
[1:12:37] you've got your place and only you are
[1:12:41] going to fit that place
[1:12:44] so what are we saying saying that the
[1:12:46] mark is high
[1:12:47] that the mark requires you to press and
[1:12:49] you will press if you wreck
[1:12:51] if you set the mark higher than just a
[1:12:53] church you know mwti tool
[1:12:56] well you set that mark a little higher
[1:12:58] you recognize i've got
[1:12:59] god wants me to be good at something god
[1:13:01] has a purpose for me god has a plan for
[1:13:03] me you stand up a little
[1:13:04] straighter you square your shoulders
[1:13:05] back and you recognize that god not only
[1:13:07] does he love me not only does he die for
[1:13:09] me because he died for everybody but no
[1:13:11] we're talking about me here this sudden
[1:13:13] became personal
[1:13:14] that god loves me that god wants to use
[1:13:17] me
[1:13:18] that god gifted and called me and you
[1:13:20] begin to stand and
[1:13:21] you begin to have purpose and then when
[1:13:22] you begin to have purpose you walk
[1:13:24] through the church doors it's like
[1:13:29] i am here and people start thinking like
[1:13:32] this brother's got a pride complex no
[1:13:34] this brother feel good
[1:13:37] let's worship god here church that's
[1:13:39] what we came to do
[1:13:41] and i'm part of that plan i'm a stone in
[1:13:43] that that wall i'm part of the
[1:13:44] foundation i'm one of the pillars
[1:13:46] i help hold this thing up let's do this
[1:13:48] church

[1:14:05] heard brother wade was preaching yeah
[1:14:10] wait i said i wasn't gonna pick on him
[1:14:14] i'm going to hear that one later
[1:14:17] and we walk into church because we have
[1:14:19] no purpose because we don't have the
[1:14:20] mark high enough
[1:14:22] we walk into the grocery store and we're
[1:14:23] like well yeah i don't know
[1:14:26] i'm a christian but because we have no
[1:14:28] purpose because we haven't set the mark
[1:14:29] high enough
[1:14:31] the problem is not with your pressing
[1:14:32] hard enough the problem is not with your
[1:14:34] your you just need to be better you just
[1:14:36] need to do harder come on church let's
[1:14:38] go
[1:14:38] why don't you actually give god some you
[1:14:40] know work it up in the motion and let's
[1:14:42] get to it and let's just dig down a
[1:14:44] little deeper he's coming soon so
[1:14:46] now it's the gun lap let's press all
[1:14:47] night now we put the after burners on
[1:14:49] and
[1:14:49] you say brother trevor okay that's great
[1:14:51] but monday i forgot
[1:14:53] because i didn't feel that i mean maybe
[1:14:55] i did for the five minutes we worshipped
[1:14:56] after service but then i got over and i
[1:14:57] started thinking about the basketball
[1:14:58] game and i forgot all about it
[1:15:02] and it don't work and after we do that
[1:15:05] about 30 times over
[1:15:07] five years we start
[1:15:10] losing the steam felt good while we were
[1:15:13] in the presence but then we left
[1:15:14] why because you didn't set the mark
[1:15:16] higher you got enthused and you got
[1:15:18] excited and that was wonderful and we
[1:15:19] need those times but man
[1:15:21] you got to recognize who you are that's
[1:15:22] what brother man said teaching is
[1:15:23] forward teaching
[1:15:24] puts you in the right place shows you
[1:15:25] who you are and where you are and you
[1:15:27] know
[1:15:28] where you fit so that you can actually
[1:15:29] do something in this world
[1:15:32] yeah god wants you to set the market
[1:15:36] yeah to give everything
[1:15:39] amen that you have but i'm god's not
[1:15:42] asking you i'm not asking you to give
[1:15:44] everything you have for the sake of
[1:15:46] giving everything you have because
[1:15:47] that's what's
[1:15:48] right do it because that's what god says
[1:15:52] figure it out do better try harder no
[1:15:57] no step back for a moment get down in
[1:15:59] prayer
[1:16:00] and recognize he's worth everything
[1:16:04] when you can begin to look at him and
[1:16:05] meditate on him you know we don't
[1:16:07] meditate anymore
[1:16:08] just like we were talking you know god
[1:16:09] doesn't change and and we think we don't
[1:16:12] meditate anymore because man meditating
[1:16:13] is like
[1:16:14] sitting there you know i'm not talking
[1:16:16] about
[1:16:18] oriental meditation i'm just talking
[1:16:19] about meditating on scripture meditating
[1:16:21] on who jesus christ is
[1:16:23] stopping for a moment considering
[1:16:25] slowing down
[1:16:26] the devil wants to speed things up and
[1:16:28] he wants to change things like crazy
[1:16:30] keep you moving keep you moving like
[1:16:31] whoa i haven't looked at my phone in two
[1:16:33] minutes i bet somebody has posted
[1:16:34] something
[1:16:35] and i bet it's super important
[1:16:42] i need to spend time with god if i spend
[1:16:45] time with god i begin to recognize that
[1:16:47] mark
[1:16:48] that's way up there and i want it
[1:16:55] and then a preacher doesn't have to come
[1:16:56] in here and tell you to press
[1:16:58] because there's something inside of you
[1:16:59] going
[1:17:10] so be awesome be awesome for him
[1:17:15] he wants you he desires you
[1:17:19] not i'm not saying what's the name of
[1:17:21] this church
[1:17:22] spoken word church i didn't say he want
[1:17:25] spoken word church
[1:17:27] he said he wants you
[1:17:34] sweep your steps prepare yourself
[1:17:38] begin to find that mark that that's him
[1:17:42] and press towards him if you truly find
[1:17:45] it you won't have to
[1:17:46] try to press how can you fail the press
[1:17:49] to the
[1:17:50] compelling awesomeness that he is
[1:17:53] that's who he is that's who he is
[1:17:58] you know i had a time in my life where
[1:18:02] um you know i was a good church kid
[1:18:05] you know i grew up in this message and
[1:18:07] such from time i was about eight
[1:18:09] when i started going to these youth
[1:18:10] camps you know down in alabama
[1:18:13] while i was in alabama i heard brother
[1:18:14] brother ron spencer he started reading
[1:18:16] quotes like
[1:18:18] out of stature of a perfect man a body
[1:18:20] has thou prepared me
[1:18:21] a body that god can dwell in god can
[1:18:24] walk in god can see in god can talk in
[1:18:26] god can work in amen
[1:18:28] living instrumentality of god god
[1:18:31] walking on two feet in you
[1:18:36] god just might be wearing johnston
[1:18:37] murphy's this morning
[1:18:40] or clarks i don't know
[1:18:44] but you look down at your feet and you
[1:18:45] say
[1:18:47] there's god walking in those feet
[1:18:51] you know i had this job and it was a
[1:18:53] terrible job but
[1:18:54] you know i'd go to the break room and
[1:18:58] and this quote would be ringing in my
[1:18:59] ears be like well
[1:19:02] god walk into the break room go eat a
[1:19:04] sandwich
[1:19:07] god's sitting in the break room eating a
[1:19:08] sandwich god walking back to my desk

[1:19:15] of god that's who i think i am that's
[1:19:17] who i know i
[1:19:18] am this quote man it started to
[1:19:20] beginning to ring in my ears i'm like
[1:19:22] man
[1:19:22] god wants to walk in my feet mine
[1:19:25] that's crazy talk why would he do that
[1:19:27] cause he desires me i don't know why he
[1:19:30] does
[1:19:31] but he does and i'm so glad he does
[1:19:36] he begins to read them we know this
[1:19:38] quote until the last day
[1:19:39] there is again another people in the
[1:19:40] land who under their messenger will be
[1:19:42] the final voice
[1:19:44] to the final age i started warming up my
[1:19:48] voice
[1:19:49] remy fosso latito
[1:19:55] let's warm this puppy up god wants to
[1:19:59] use my voice
[1:20:01] are you kidding me right now i'm 18 19
[1:20:03] years old sitting there in this youth
[1:20:05] camp going
[1:20:06] i never heard something like this wait a
[1:20:08] second like i heard what i was supposed
[1:20:09] to do
[1:20:10] i heard the doctrines i heard how this
[1:20:11] was all going to work out and
[1:20:13] how the coming of the lord and the how
[1:20:15] many years and this all these things and
[1:20:17] that's great i love those things man i
[1:20:18] can geek out on those things
[1:20:20] you know theological geeks that's okay
[1:20:22] you know
[1:20:23] anyway i lo look i love that just as
[1:20:25] much as the next guy
[1:20:28] but wasn't when i was 19 i didn't even
[1:20:29] be told god wanted to use me
[1:20:32] god had a purpose for me it wasn't just
[1:20:34] about dates and times and theology
[1:20:37] but there was a reality that this
[1:20:38] message was that could come on the
[1:20:40] inside
[1:20:41] and not just seal me to take me to
[1:20:42] heaven but to put me in action into
[1:20:45] service
[1:20:45] that there was something that god wanted
[1:20:47] for me and i loved that man
[1:20:49] i said all right i get it now i know why
[1:20:53] i'm learning this now
[1:20:55] because because it tells me who god is
[1:20:57] and so many wonderful things and then
[1:20:59] i'm going to use that
[1:21:00] for him great man
[1:21:03] oh man i loved it these last days the
[1:21:05] true bride church comes to the headstone
[1:21:06] she'll be the super church of super race
[1:21:08] as she nears a great headstone
[1:21:10] man that's cool they will be so much
[1:21:12] like so much like
[1:21:14] him they will be even in his very image
[1:21:16] me
[1:21:17] i'm from minnesota yeah
[1:21:20] i started working at that airport people
[1:21:21] be like you don't you're not from here
[1:21:23] are you
[1:21:28] yeah no sir i'm up there around
[1:21:29] minneapolis yeah sit a little colder up
[1:21:32] there yeah
[1:21:34] he wants to use my voice that's weird
[1:21:39] but he does but he does
[1:21:44] so when a spirit born you know this one
[1:21:46] you could all just quote it with me
[1:21:48] spirit-filled man
[1:21:50] takes that word into his heart places it
[1:21:53] upon his lips
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:04] you know what i said sign me up god
[1:22:17] see the mark got set higher right when
[1:22:19] that mark got set higher and i caught a
[1:22:21] vision that
[1:22:22] there was more than just me
[1:22:23] understanding stuff and that was message
[1:22:26] but that there was a purpose in all of
[1:22:27] it
[1:22:30] i mean i didn't have a problem just
[1:22:31] sitting there and doing the thing the
[1:22:32] problem is is when we sit there doing
[1:22:33] the thing
[1:22:34] and we get a little bored well then we
[1:22:36] start getting a little lax and we let
[1:22:37] things we shouldn't into our lives but
[1:22:40] when we really catch a vision that god
[1:22:42] wants me and he wants to use me man it
[1:22:43] makes you stand up straight
[1:22:45] makes you go yay i'm so glad to be a
[1:22:47] part of this i'm filled with joy and
[1:22:48] purpose and
[1:22:49] all right here we go let's do this
[1:22:54] nobody had to tell me to press anymore
[1:22:57] that's right
[1:22:59] i did it because i caught that vision
[1:23:03] i trust you will too from beyond the
[1:23:06] curtain of time musicians you can come
[1:23:13] i love this because it's just so poetic
[1:23:14] and beautiful each one of us
[1:23:18] play a part in this picture
[1:23:22] and in this song we are parts of the
[1:23:25] kingdom of god
[1:23:26] and that is we can play our parts as
[1:23:28] long as we realize where we are
[1:23:30] positionally belong in this place and
[1:23:31] then stay right there in that place
[1:23:34] and one place we know it's in love
[1:23:38] because that's what makes up the picture
[1:23:43] you have your place you have your part
[1:23:46] in this song
[1:23:47] and in this picture
[1:23:51] romans 13 11 and that knowing the time
[1:23:54] that now it is high time to awake out of
[1:23:56] sleep
[1:23:57] for now is our salvation nearer
[1:24:01] than what we believed and when we
[1:24:02] believed
[1:24:04] it's time church it's time to see where
[1:24:07] the mark is
[1:24:08] if you've been asleep
[1:24:12] meditate on god get that mark a little
[1:24:14] higher
[1:24:17] that'll set you up good shall we pray
[1:24:21] heavenly father
[1:24:25] but we love you so much you're so you're
[1:24:27] so good to us
[1:24:30] lord we want to serve you from the
[1:24:32] depths of our heart lord we're sitting
[1:24:33] in this church because we love you
[1:24:34] because we've been trained we've been
[1:24:35] taught we've been
[1:24:37] uh we've been convinced of the realities
[1:24:39] of a god but father sometimes we
