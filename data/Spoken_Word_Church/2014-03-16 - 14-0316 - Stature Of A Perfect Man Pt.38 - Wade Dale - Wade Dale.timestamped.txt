[0:00] good to be back in the house of the Lord
[0:02] good to have you back got it all we
[0:03] going have we going to need a light or
[0:05] something here not right now that's I
[0:07] want to see this let's turn to Second
[0:08] Peter
[0:09] 1 and uh read the scripture
[0:17] here anybody had their patients tried
[0:20] this past
[0:23] week only
[0:24] two bunch of liars oh right that's
[0:27] better
[0:30] okay well some sleep or didn't Kathy
[0:33] must have slept during the week cuz she
[0:34] didn't have her hand
[0:36] up
[0:38] I your was your patience tried this week
[0:42] no you leave a r don't
[0:44] you Hallelujah then ra that's why he
[0:47] raised his
[0:49] hand
[0:52] anyway we've all had our patients tried
[0:54] somewhere whether you realize it or not
[0:57] you
[0:58] did like a go back to again
[1:01] patience Temperance and Patience are two
[1:04] things that you just get banged at every
[1:06] day just bang bang bang your Temperance
[1:09] and your patience because remember your
[1:11] Temperance and
[1:13] patience is what happens
[1:16] externally see faith is what's inside
[1:20] virtue is what's inside knowledge is
[1:22] what's inside Temperance is what goes on
[1:25] out
[1:27] here what goes on around you yes I mean
[1:30] sure you get mad at yourself but we do
[1:33] that all the time but the Bible talks
[1:35] about getting mad at others or being
[1:37] being off with a brother or a sister and
[1:40] um that's external patience is external
[1:44] cuz you got to be patient what what
[1:46] brother R say we're going to read it in
[1:47] a minute he have patience with God first
[1:50] then have patience with your brother all
[1:52] right second Peter 1 according as his
[1:55] divine power ha given unto us all things
[1:57] that pertaineth unto life and godliness
[1:59] through the knowledge of him that ha
[2:00] called us to glory and
[2:01] virtue whereby are given unto us
[2:04] exceeding great and precious promises
[2:06] thereby
[2:07] these what these promises you might be
[2:09] partakers of the divine nature having
[2:12] escaped you see what it says it says
[2:14] that you might be partakers of some
[2:16] divine nature no it says the there's
[2:20] only one divine nature that's God
[2:24] anything Divine has to do with God
[2:26] that's his Divine the divine nature
[2:30] excuse me having escaped the corruption
[2:31] that is in the world through lust and
[2:34] besides
[2:35] this that was talking about your new
[2:37] birth besides your new birth amen that's
[2:41] beside your new birth it's what we've
[2:42] been talking about forever and ever all
[2:45] this right here is from is your new
[2:46] birth all this but now from here down
[2:50] and besides this and besides your new
[2:53] birth right yes besides your new birth
[2:57] giving all diligence add to your new
[2:59] birth or your faith virtue virtue
[3:02] knowledge knowledge Temperance
[3:04] Temperance patience patience godliness
[3:08] now we looked up the word there patience
[3:09] is
[3:13] enduring patient countenance
[3:16] steadfastness constancy in other words
[3:18] constant
[3:20] enduring in the New Testament cuz
[3:23] remember the word patient is not in the
[3:25] Old Testament remember it's only starts
[3:28] in the New Testament cuz Moses didn't
[3:31] have patience he didn't have Godly
[3:34] patience speak to the Rock right right
[3:37] speak to the Rock he smoked the rock
[3:39] kill the person killed the Egyptian
[3:42] walks down to the water and looks around
[3:46] and then he goes into EGP I mean he goes
[3:47] into uh the desert with his people and
[3:50] he says what's your PE what's your
[3:52] problem you know in other words he
[3:54] started you know letting them have it
[3:55] for being who they were and U but all
[3:59] also there was a characteristic of
[4:01] Christ there because I think he became
[4:03] patient because the Bible said he was
[4:04] the meekest man in the world so he
[4:06] gained patience with his
[4:09] people but they could not because the
[4:13] had right it could not totally overtake
[4:15] their being let's put it that way it
[4:18] could anoint them like an anointed one
[4:20] it could anoint them on their Spirit it
[4:22] anointed Moses's
[4:24] Spirit but yet it couldn't get into his
[4:27] soul to reside in his soul for him to be
[4:29] a born again believer cuz to be born
[4:32] again you have to
[4:33] be born again all right but they weren't
[4:37] born again in the Old Testament a lot of
[4:39] people don't agree with that but there's
[4:41] thousands of scriptures and uh even I
[4:44] have a quote where brother R said in
[4:46] Oneness with God he said that the
[4:49] disciples were contrary with Jesus then
[4:51] the next quote he says because God
[4:53] wasn't in them
[4:55] yet and that's the truth God wasn't in
[4:57] them yet now d just like we were talking
[5:00] about here now David those two or three
[5:02] chapters of Psalms a lot of that if
[5:05] you'll realize it was what happened at
[5:06] the cross I I was dumb I didn't speak
[5:10] right you know all that we read the
[5:11] other Sunday my bones they stared at me
[5:13] well David was speaking in the first
[5:15] person that was Christ speaking through
[5:18] David but see remember Christ wasn't I
[5:21] mean David wasn't Christ he portrayed a
[5:24] part of it in the Old Testament like I
[5:27] was preaching upstairs the other day
[5:29] about the the Journey of the Genesis one
[5:30] man you can see the Genesis one man down
[5:32] through where brother Bram said I was
[5:34] identified with Moses sure there were
[5:36] certain things I wasn't identified with
[5:38] Moses when he killed the Egyptian I
[5:40] wasn't identified with David when he had
[5:42] his best friend killed to marry his wife
[5:45] committed adultery first and then had
[5:47] his wife killed then had the man's wife
[5:49] but had the man killed and took his wife
[5:53] so but
[5:55] still they had a part of God that was a
[6:00] um
[6:02] anointing uh it would remember the the
[6:05] anointing would come on Moses and his
[6:06] face would shine well see that was God
[6:09] speaking through through the person
[6:11] Moses but when Moses stepped back must I
[6:15] fetch you water you a bunch of rebels
[6:16] you know I mean he he showed a little
[6:19] bit of things that that a born true Born
[6:21] Again believer shouldn't do David
[6:22] portrayed some things uh different ones
[6:25] um what were we talking about the other
[6:27] day Amos or somewhere which one one of
[6:28] them married a itute well now
[6:33] listen that doesn't apply to the
[6:36] day right God's not going to tell you in
[6:39] this hour to go marry prostitute he's
[6:42] just not because the New Birth has come
[6:44] because now it's a cleansing of the
[6:47] Soul now if a sister is a was a
[6:50] prostitute back in the past life and
[6:52] she's born again she's just as righteous
[6:53] is arrest a pure virgin okay there's a
[6:58] difference between a tight and the
[7:00] original that's correct because the
[7:01] original is here that's right because
[7:04] types in the Old Testament even types in
[7:06] the New Testament of the Bride but this
[7:09] is the reality this is the literal part
[7:12] of God this is the part of God he wanted
[7:15] when he said add to your faith and and
[7:17] let me do this it would be nice if you
[7:19] could do
[7:23] that right here it says according as as
[7:25] divine power hath given unto us all
[7:28] things that pertain to life life and
[7:30] godliness whereby whereby are given unto
[7:32] us exceeding great and precious promises
[7:34] that by these promises we might be
[7:36] partakers of the divine nature David
[7:39] couldn't partake of the divine nature he
[7:41] had a part of the divine nature that
[7:43] anointed him so Christ was so real even
[7:46] in the Old Testament but it wasn't
[7:48] residing in a group of people as far as
[7:51] a group of Believers cuz
[7:53] remember get this one point Jesus said
[7:57] John was the greatest of all the
[7:59] prophets is that right that's right but
[8:02] the least in the Kingdom see the kingdom
[8:04] hadn't come in the Old Testament that's
[8:07] right thy kingdom come Jesus said thy
[8:09] will be done they weren't in the Kingdom
[8:12] Abraham wasn't in the Kingdom Isaac
[8:13] Jacob Joseph David Moses Noah they
[8:17] weren't in the Kingdom cuz he said Jesus
[8:19] said himself the least in the Kingdom
[8:21] right is greater than John that's right
[8:23] because they have the new birth residing
[8:25] now John had the Holy Ghost
[8:30] portion but not a residing of the Holy
[8:32] Ghost cuz I'll promise you one thing
[8:34] when they went to John in prison and
[8:36] John started going well was that Jesus
[8:38] or not now that was John right that
[8:41] wasn't a holy ghost if you was a newborn
[8:44] believer and you saw Jesus Christ I'll
[8:46] guarantee you'd know who it was and you
[8:48] wouldn't ask him 6 months later are you
[8:50] the one that's right amen so John didn't
[8:53] have the new birth but he had the Holy
[8:56] Ghost that's right you said well it is
[8:57] the same but it's not the same
[9:00] everybody understand that it is the same
[9:01] but it's not cuz brother B said you have
[9:04] the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day
[9:07] of your life and die and go to hell the
[9:08] Holy Ghost he didn't say the new birth
[9:10] that's right he never said the new birth
[9:12] that's right so the Holy Ghost comes but
[9:15] you got to have a new birth to drive
[9:18] that unclean Spirit out right problem
[9:20] with David he still had an unclean
[9:22] spirit that he led after a man's wife
[9:25] yet he could stand back in the temple as
[9:28] a prophet and do the things of a prophet
[9:31] go in and eat the shoe bread go in and
[9:32] do the different things because God knew
[9:35] the Integrity of his heart all right you
[9:39] got a question oh I was just say a while
[9:41] ago you talked about being identified
[9:43] with parts of like Moses and and I just
[9:47] thought can that apply to today I mean I
[9:50] mean cuz when I come here around
[9:53] everybody by the end of the day I just
[9:54] feel like I'm alive you know like I
[9:57] wasn't during the week I mean can can
[9:59] you say that we identified with each
[10:01] other like that if you got the new birth
[10:03] you definitely are the same yes person
[10:05] yes right right a one you got the same
[10:08] person a but one a one a but one that's
[10:11] why that's why people I'm telling you
[10:13] not just for you sister free everybody
[10:15] it's so important to come to church God
[10:18] instituted it and never took it
[10:21] out he said don't forsake the assembling
[10:24] of yourself together and much more as
[10:25] the day approaches the problem is we
[10:27] don't think it's much more we don't
[10:28] think the day approaching cuz we don't
[10:31] come to church like we used
[10:33] to brother BR said a holy ghost filled
[10:36] person cannot wait for the doors to open
[10:37] now that's your Prophet nothing I've
[10:40] said if it makes you mad then tough he
[10:43] said talk to him about it not me he's
[10:45] the one that said it he said a holy
[10:47] ghost filled person cannot wait but
[10:50] that's if you're being said good yes
[10:53] last why 5 minutes till 9: this morning
[10:55] I get all antsy and I start grabbing
[10:57] stuff I get jun's pocketbook and I get
[10:59] all I'm ready to go out the door why I
[11:01] want to be in church I don't want to be
[11:03] early I don't want to miss something Ain
[11:05] just cuz we got to hook all this up this
[11:06] is easy now this an easy hook up I can
[11:10] do this in an instant and don't need
[11:11] some of these computer geeks to help me
[11:14] and thanks to Sister Rebecca she got one
[11:16] that I can have here and one I can leave
[11:18] at home
[11:20] so praise the Lord what was I doing
[11:23] steadfastness let's let's get on to this
[11:25] or we're not going to ever get finished
[11:26] with P we're have enough patience to get
[11:27] finished with patience
[11:30] a patient steadfast waiting
[11:33] for enduring
[11:36] sustaining perseverance when you see the
[11:38] word they that wait upon the Lord what
[11:40] is that word wait
[11:43] patience persever
[11:46] persevere Paul run a
[11:48] race he run a race to
[11:51] win that's what we're supposed to do
[11:53] we're not supposed to lay down
[11:56] and and let the Devils cuz you look what
[11:59] we were reading David we were reading
[12:01] David and he was right here on he was on
[12:03] a
[12:04] high then he got on a low then he got
[12:08] back on a high then he got back on a low
[12:10] then he got back on a high why because
[12:13] he was constantly fighting with that
[12:15] thing that was inside of him God would
[12:18] anoint him to do something and then he
[12:19] said oh my iniquities reach all the way
[12:21] to
[12:22] heaven well see mine and your
[12:25] iniquity should be gone as far as our
[12:28] soul and our new Earth sure we sin every
[12:30] day but iniquity is to do it and know
[12:32] not to do it now to sin willfully
[12:36] there's a problem there when you talking
[12:38] about David H brother bandom I said that
[12:42] where the scripture says David was a man
[12:44] after God's Own Heart he said you know
[12:46] why because he repented he repented that
[12:49] was the difference in David and maybe
[12:53] Saul Saul was maybe a little bit exalted
[12:56] in himself
[12:59] David would do something and he I'm sure
[13:01] after going to the bed of basa he
[13:03] probably repented all day and all night
[13:05] but he couldn't get that off of him he
[13:07] didn't know how to get that off of him
[13:09] right but we we as being born again
[13:11] Believers we have a way to get that off
[13:13] of us cuz the devil can anoint our
[13:16] spirit that's right no no let me refr
[13:19] let me rephrase that he will anoint your
[13:22] spirit that's right I say he can he will
[13:25] doesn't he play in your memory that's
[13:26] right doesn't he play in your conscience
[13:28] that's right affection that's right
[13:31] imagination right all those things all
[13:34] right he plays in all
[13:35] that memory reason conscience affection
[13:38] imagination all those things man that's
[13:41] where he placed but he can't get in the
[13:43] soul of man if you're born again so what
[13:45] we have to do is is we have to take this
[13:48] inward work and make it go out we have
[13:50] to take the inward work and make it push
[13:52] out all right be patient have patience
[13:56] bear long suffer long to be of a long
[14:00] Spirit not to lose
[14:04] heart to persevere patiently and bravely
[14:07] and enduring misfortunes and troubles
[14:09] that was
[14:10] David you shall be hated of all men for
[14:13] my name's sake but there shall not a
[14:14] hair of your head perish in your
[14:17] patience possess ye your souls all
[14:20] right let's get on over here and read
[14:22] what brother R says we had got to that
[14:24] yet but just a little bit let's reading
[14:26] statute of a perfect
[14:28] man he's talking about knowledge when
[14:30] your knowledge is like his knowledge I
[14:31] come to do thy will oh God see but the
[14:34] father's word he defeated every devil
[14:35] heavens and earth will pass away but the
[14:37] word will not see when you got that kind
[14:39] of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your
[14:41] faith when you got the right kind of
[14:43] temperance like he had it'll vulcanize
[14:46] if you haven't just a manmade halfway
[14:48] SED up belief or Temperance oh ought to
[14:50] slap him down but maybe I better not
[14:53] everybody reading that yep maybe I
[14:56] better not cuz somebody might say me put
[14:59] my name in the
[15:02] paper that ain't the kind of temperance
[15:05] he's talking about don't try to add that
[15:07] it won't work but when you can really
[15:09] with a sweetness from your heart forgive
[15:11] every man hold your peace let it be gone
[15:14] see then it'll vulcanize you can add
[15:16] that to your faith no wonder the church
[15:19] is so short isn't that right no wonder
[15:22] I'd say repent and be baptized in the
[15:23] name of Jesus Christ and a strict tarian
[15:25] don't believe that said oh Antichrist
[15:27] he's a Jesus name he's Jesus only Look
[15:29] Out Boy I don't know about your
[15:31] Temperance right now why don't you come
[15:33] say let's reason this together brother
[15:35] ROM I'd like to hear this explain then
[15:37] come down and listen to it all right so
[15:40] let's go on then after that fourthly you
[15:42] want to add patience to your faith if
[15:45] you got faith it work as
[15:48] patience all
[15:50] right if you got faith it work as
[15:53] patience the Bible said see so this is
[15:55] patient now that's the next thing going
[15:57] to build this stature you know God is
[15:59] got real material in his building see
[16:01] how short we are brothers sisters see
[16:03] see why where we're at yes sir we have
[16:06] Glory we shout things because we got
[16:08] faith but when we come down to these
[16:10] things here God can't build us into that
[16:13] stature you reading with me can't build
[16:17] that we got mean we got faith we got the
[16:20] new birth right he can't he can't make
[16:23] us up to that kind of a place we got all
[16:25] these other things we fall slide off of
[16:27] it he can cannot build his church or
[16:30] can't build his
[16:31] church paragraph 233 patience with what
[16:35] what kind of patience first thing is
[16:37] have patience with
[16:39] God okay first thing patience with
[16:43] God in other words patience with God
[16:46] that he'll do what he said he'd do okay
[16:48] right that's why Abraham had Faith he
[16:50] was the father of our faith he said God
[16:52] you said it you going to have to make it
[16:53] happen cuz I can't make it happen all
[16:56] right problem is what we try to do is we
[16:58] try to help God yes right yes we do and
[17:01] we try to do it our way and we mess up
[17:05] first thing is have patience with God if
[17:07] you've got real genuine faith you'll
[17:09] have real genuine
[17:11] patience because Faith work is patience
[17:14] that's right when God says anything you
[17:16] believe it that's all you got patience
[17:19] say well I asked him last night to heal
[17:21] me and I'm just to sit oh my what
[17:24] patience God told Abraham and 25 years
[17:27] later there wasn't even one sign
[17:29] actually it got worse he was still
[17:31] believing he was patient with God
[17:33] mhm put him always before you let him be
[17:37] the next Crossing thing you can't cross
[17:39] him so just keep him before you he said
[17:41] so and it's going to happen see keep him
[17:43] before you that's right Noah had
[17:46] patience yeah Noah had real Godly
[17:48] patience God said I'm going to destroy
[17:51] the world with rain and no preach 120
[17:52] years yet 120
[17:57] years and only as f family listened to
[18:00] him and his family doubt it a little bit
[18:03] cuz watch what brother Brown
[18:05] said then God tries your patience that's
[18:08] right God tries them after he told Noah
[18:10] now Noah I want you to go ahead and get
[18:12] in the ark and that new Noah movie is
[18:14] coming out Mark 28 so it it would be
[18:17] something I've seen the previews and I I
[18:18] think it it it's very scriptural so I'd
[18:21] go take a look at it don't Advocate
[18:24] going to movies
[18:25] but that would be something to watch
[18:28] because
[18:29] man has always said that 40 days and 40
[18:32] nights of rain would never flood the
[18:34] Earth it didn't the Bible says The
[18:37] Fountains of the deep opened up so you
[18:39] can see Noah looking out in the trailer
[18:40] you see Noah looking he's on the boat
[18:42] and he looks out across the landscape
[18:44] and all of a sudden these big water like
[18:48] water pipes but it's water come shooting
[18:50] up out of the ground and uh that's where
[18:53] the fountains of the deep opened up cuz
[18:55] remember there was no rain that's what
[18:56] it that's why it made it more impossible
[18:58] for Noah to preach that it was going to
[19:00] rain cuz it never rained
[19:02] before so the scientists and the people
[19:04] of the world said they ain't enough
[19:05] water to come from up there to flood the
[19:09] whole world but they just didn't know
[19:10] that they were walking on the thing that
[19:13] was going to open up and cause all the
[19:16] catastrophe right under their feet not
[19:18] coming from above cuz man destroys
[19:20] himself always no I want you to go ahead
[19:22] and get in the ark I'm going to run the
[19:23] animals in there I want you to get in
[19:25] climb way upstairs now so you look out
[19:27] the top window now once you get in in
[19:28] there I want you to tell those people
[19:31] tomorrow what I've been pre tomorrow
[19:34] tell them tomorrow what I've been
[19:35] preaching for 120 years is going to take
[19:37] place all right you go down there and
[19:38] tell
[19:39] them then we skip on through said now we
[19:42] got that way we got that way add it but
[19:46] if you ain't got it that way don't try
[19:47] to add it it won't work won't work on
[19:49] healing won't work on nothing else see
[19:50] it's got a blend with the same material
[19:52] it's vulcanized too so you got to have
[19:55] the new birth for patience or anything
[19:58] else to oriz with it right because your
[20:00] New Birth has all that in it the New
[20:03] Birth has all the Perfection all the
[20:05] Genesis 126 man doesn't have to be
[20:08] perfected the Genesis 1:26 man is
[20:11] perfect that's right that's God that's
[20:13] right never send a day in his life never
[20:15] had iniquity never did anything wrong
[20:16] that's right but what's on top of that
[20:18] is when you're born into this world with
[20:20] a fallen nature and you got a spirit on
[20:23] all that that's not the Holy Spirit
[20:25] that's right yeah mhm that takes and it
[20:29] runs you into the tree of knowledge of
[20:31] Good and Evil which we were born on and
[20:33] it brings us up here not down here
[20:35] everybody understand what I'm saying it
[20:36] brings up here man's knowledge not you
[20:39] know God took the heart man took the
[20:40] edge right so same way with these things
[20:42] even when you're born again though you
[20:44] still got to come right back out and go
[20:47] through the justification sanctification
[20:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost process all
[20:50] over again only on a higher
[20:53] level now we've taught that here forever
[20:56] so so it shouldn't be anything you know
[20:59] strain but it's a process it's always
[21:02] justification just a higher form brother
[21:04] Brown said there's a mysterious part of
[21:06] justification Luther didn't have that
[21:08] mysterious part Luther had justification
[21:10] the just shall live by faith that's it
[21:13] but the mysterious part of justification
[21:14] is is you never done it in the first
[21:16] place did right you're
[21:18] Justified you we got to realize that
[21:20] that's what the message brought if you
[21:21] don't ever realize that you're not going
[21:22] to get this guy
[21:24] changed cuz you're going to condemn
[21:25] yourself where you're not going to take
[21:26] a body change but this statute of
[21:28] perfect man is put in the order of us to
[21:31] get a body change that's right that's
[21:33] right I said in the order cuz brother
[21:35] random had this and he didn't take a
[21:36] body change that's right but you have to
[21:38] have these things that's true before a
[21:40] body change can come right all right you
[21:42] can't Skip and go around and say well
[21:44] I'm just in the message I'm going to
[21:45] take a body chain I hear that and it
[21:47] makes me sick actually because nobody
[21:49] knows the steps or the journey to go
[21:51] through that brother brandham laid out
[21:53] it's not something doctrine that we
[21:55] preach here it's a doctrine that brother
[21:56] brandham tried to get us to see
[21:59] that it's not just be born again and get
[22:01] a change of the body right you get born
[22:05] again you going to die and go by the
[22:06] grave and then you'll get a body change
[22:08] because you have to be
[22:10] purged that's a purging of this man
[22:13] that's right not a purging of the Inside
[22:15] Man the inside man's
[22:17] perfect that's right that's right the
[22:19] inside man's perfect that's right it's
[22:21] this guy it's the one we were born when
[22:23] we were born in this domain we got a
[22:25] nature that was contrary to God right
[22:29] and that Nature's got to die but as that
[22:31] nature dies though you still got a
[22:33] spirit on that called memory reason
[22:36] conscious affs and
[22:37] Imagination that's where Satan runs wild
[22:41] cuz he can get into your spirit and work
[22:42] but he can't get in your soul if you're
[22:43] born again but you can take what's in
[22:46] your soul work its way out and become a
[22:50] stature of a perfect and not a statue
[22:54] right stature is height growth
[22:55] development a statue is just a statue
[22:58] but this is a stature it's a height or a
[23:01] growth growth development all right W
[23:05] work on nothing else same until was
[23:06] vulcanized too that's right got to add
[23:08] it he had patience with God 120
[23:11] years and if you go on to the story
[23:13] which I cut out for time brother Brown
[23:15] said they got into the ark and remember
[23:17] it was 7 days before it started raining
[23:19] God shut the door of the Ark and he said
[23:22] his daughter or his daughter-in-law
[23:23] comes up and says Noah you you
[23:26] sure it'll rain he say
[23:29] then his son's come up and said now
[23:31] Daddy I know you preach for 120 years
[23:33] and we're sitting in this hot stinking
[23:35] art when's it going to happen he said it
[23:38] will rain see he never lost right then
[23:41] he could have lost all of his all of his
[23:43] profession right there all the
[23:45] circumstances made it
[23:49] worse that's why tribulation worketh
[23:53] patience if you don't have any
[23:54] tribulation in your life you're not
[23:55] going to know whether you got patience
[23:56] or not right yeah let me ask you a
[24:00] question and everybody I'm pretty sure
[24:02] everybody experienced it but I and I've
[24:04] been praying and asking God to help me
[24:06] with it but you know how when you're
[24:07] driving alone and and you know that the
[24:11] people that you see we we got the U ex
[24:14] Street and this guy come in and he's
[24:18] he's he's coming in from nowhere and
[24:19] he's speeding up to get in front of you
[24:22] my patients I've been trying to do it I
[24:25] get such an attitude because he knows
[24:28] that he's not going to turn off but yet
[24:30] he's trying to get in front of you and
[24:32] I'm doing better because now I want to
[24:35] know how do you get that that feeling
[24:37] that you you don't get upset about it
[24:39] but it's still in your heart that you
[24:41] say well you know this this this person
[24:43] is going crazy and you know when
[24:44] somebody cut you off you yeah that's
[24:47] wrong you quit running them off the road
[24:48] right no I never run oh you never okay
[24:52] but saying everybody experien that how
[24:54] do you get the the feeling that this
[24:57] person listen hey it's always going to
[24:59] rise up because that old man sure is
[25:01] dead but that man that's on top of that
[25:04] Spirit that's anointing your memories
[25:06] and conscience it's going to bring stuff
[25:08] up I mean it's going to pop her up just
[25:10] like this I mean see that's the trial
[25:12] that's coming it would be a lot easier
[25:14] to just be driving down the road and you
[25:16] in this fog and you know you you think
[25:20] you thinking I've been baptized in the
[25:22] name of Jesus Christ and I've got God in
[25:24] my heart and I'm just singing and all of
[25:26] a sudden the guy jumped and pray you
[25:28] just keep keep right on singing and no
[25:30] no you stop
[25:32] singing that's what I'm saying and you
[25:35] thoughts go through your mind and God
[25:36] knows every thought and God knows every
[25:39] thought whether it's just you in the car
[25:40] by yourself or not there's recording
[25:42] Angels sitting over there going what is
[25:44] she
[25:46] say can we take that back the
[25:51] garden that's where this has got to push
[25:54] it back
[25:56] down that's what I'm saying it's got to
[25:59] push it back down so we just practice on
[26:01] pushing it back down or we practice on
[26:02] pushing it back down I do the same thing
[26:04] you wonder why people do what they do
[26:06] they're just siners yeah and then if you
[26:08] drive low you can't drive from me stop
[26:11] driving you can't drive for me in the
[26:13] back and you going to blow and tell me
[26:15] to go faster cuz you see the light is
[26:16] turning yellow I get an attitude and you
[26:19] the whole thing is I want to get rid of
[26:21] best thing do just wave out just say God
[26:23] bless you I have that problem too just
[26:25] say God bless you and don't whether they
[26:27] hear you or not
[26:29] but okay they you know they may have
[26:31] problems I have they may have problems
[26:33] they need to get to work early or
[26:35] whatever leave home earlier and don't
[26:37] blow but you can there's no way you can
[26:39] take 300 million Americans and make them
[26:41] do
[26:43] that but I'm saying that's what I said
[26:45] you got to control your
[26:47] environment regardless of what's in this
[26:50] environment so God
[26:52] gave God give you something in you to
[26:55] just if that little radar thing goes up
[26:57] a little bit just just just let it go
[26:58] back
[26:59] down because
[27:02] before you would that so and so that and
[27:05] you want to run them off the road and
[27:07] you want to ask them why did they why do
[27:09] that why you need to ask them anything
[27:12] they they have no they don't care who
[27:14] you are but I want to be when when they
[27:17] give you know the finger or whatever you
[27:18] say God L yeah sure you a woman gave me
[27:22] a three mile burden not too long you
[27:24] know when me and ter was working buddy
[27:25] she laid that finger up put on thing
[27:27] right there like and she never stopped
[27:29] she just kept driving and she laid that
[27:31] fer she ter was trying to speed up so he
[27:34] could wave at her you know I mean we
[27:35] made it fun of it but she was
[27:38] mad that's a world record you get a
[27:40] three mile bird you know usually they
[27:41] flip you off and take off but no this
[27:43] lady later I thought her finger had got
[27:45] jammed or something you know thought she
[27:47] had a cramp or something but I looked
[27:49] over there buddy she had it laid on the
[27:50] Wind window you know just laying it to
[27:52] me but anyway I mean to make a joke out
[27:55] of it now you before
[27:58] I might have run that woman off the
[28:03] road get shot yes you know what what
[28:06] might be helpful in this situation is
[28:08] the white dog and the black dog which
[28:09] one do you need more because it sounds
[28:11] like you you're holding on to that you
[28:13] need to think about Jesus at that time
[28:16] no that's what I'm saying but comes like
[28:18] second nature it's going to come out
[28:20] it's going to come up because that's the
[28:21] part of the nature you live with you got
[28:23] to say okay Jesus God bless you but you
[28:26] decrease in what's what's going on you
[28:28] know you don't get as angry at and I I
[28:30] know
[28:33] that but you say you holding on you say
[28:36] well one day the first thing going hit
[28:38] my mind oh that person must have a
[28:40] problem let me slow down when get in
[28:42] front of that's a good idea good now why
[28:44] can't you do that I I have to do I have
[28:46] to I have to think about listen we have
[28:48] to because by Nature I have I see listen
[28:51] let me give you scripture by Nature we
[28:53] are children of Wrath that's the Bible
[28:56] That's Right By Nature that's right the
[28:58] children of Wrath that's right everybody
[29:01] we we we we get up hating people and we
[29:03] go to bed hating people that's in our
[29:05] normal life but now I was going to be um
[29:10] short today but we'll pick this up next
[29:12] Sunday I know y'all had question
[29:15] Rachel help to you know just think about
[29:19] they might be having something going on
[29:20] in their life at that time and so I like
[29:23] to think about that you know no matter
[29:25] what I go through because you know
[29:26] brother talked about that
[29:29] waitress she was having a bad day and
[29:31] you know it doesn't help to get red up
[29:33] about that I mean these people could be
[29:35] rushing to their kids baseball game or
[29:37] or to doctor every time I see somebody
[29:39] broke down side of the road I say God
[29:41] send them somebody I'm not going to stop
[29:44] but God send them somebody and bless
[29:45] them I do it I honestly I might miss one
[29:48] out of a hundred but most of the time if
[29:50] somebody's on the side of the road I'll
[29:51] say God send them somebody and bless
[29:54] them amen and you know I don't care if
[29:56] they're a sinner or a saint it don't
[29:57] matter to me okay so that's what you got
[29:59] to do you're not got not to put levels
[30:01] sin or Saint doesn't matter Tre them all
[30:03] the same the problem is what I do a lot
[30:06] of people say oh I went to Walmart and I
[30:08] had to hear that old music and that's
[30:09] all naked and all that you know what I
[30:11] do I just focus on what I'm going in
[30:13] there I think every one of them are
[30:16] sinners they're doing exactly what
[30:18] they're supposed to they're doing what
[30:19] they're supposed to do they're doing
[30:21] exactly and I'm suppos to we're supposed
[30:23] to do what we're supposed to do what I'm
[30:26] suppos to
