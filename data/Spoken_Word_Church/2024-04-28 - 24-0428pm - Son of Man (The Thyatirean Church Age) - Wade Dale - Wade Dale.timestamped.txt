[19:54] so uh let's bow our heads and pray Lord
[19:58] thank you so much for giving us a day to
[20:01] be able to stand here Lord and to speak
[20:04] to the people about
[20:06] you father that's a desire in our heart
[20:08] before we walk out of the out of the
[20:11] office there Lord is for you to speak
[20:15] through us and and Open the Eyes of our
[20:17] heart Lord and and Lord just be with us
[20:21] by
[20:22] Revelation many many things that that
[20:25] Satan can give us to impersonate but he
[20:27] can't give us a true Revelation from you
[20:29] so father we pray that we we receive
[20:31] today a true Revelation from you Lord
[20:34] and I pray for those that are sick Lord
[20:35] that you would give them a true
[20:36] Revelation that by your stripes they're
[20:39] already healed and that they'll claim
[20:41] that now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:43] just bless each one now in the furth of
[20:45] the service bless us in Jesus name amen
[20:49] God bless you love you with the love of
[20:51] the Lord so let's go to Revelations 1
[20:53] we'll talk a little bit about the Beast
[20:55] again I want to bring something else in
[20:58] uh um on that but let's start with our
[21:01] regular scripture I was in the spirit on
[21:03] the Lord's day and I heard behind me a
[21:04] great voice as a
[21:06] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[21:08] first and the last what thou see us
[21:10] write in a book and send it unto the
[21:12] seven churches thank God that he sent us
[21:15] a prophet that wrote a church AE book
[21:17] that explained these things to us and
[21:19] helped us to see these things that no
[21:22] one else and had only God knew who those
[21:24] seven stars were only God knew them man
[21:28] didn't know who they were man would have
[21:30] said maybe polycarp man would have said
[21:32] maybe probably this one or that one or
[21:34] or as we're going to see this afternoon
[21:36] St Patrick was was probably a more
[21:38] powerful Minister than Columba but God
[21:41] didn't pick St Patrick he picked St
[21:44] Columba for a certain reason and maybe
[21:46] we'll get that later on but maybe not
[21:47] today but thank God for a prophet that
[21:49] said this is it this is your pattern
[21:51] this is what to look for this is your
[21:53] pattern age this is your Alpha church
[21:55] this is your Omega Church they got to be
[21:57] the same and he just gives this a
[21:58] beautiful picture it takes away all the
[22:01] questions that we have sometimes all
[22:03] right and if you'll just let God speak
[22:05] he'll take your questions and he'll
[22:06] answer them I promise you all right so
[22:09] he sent him to the church ages I turned
[22:10] to see the voice that spake with me
[22:11] being turned I saw seven golden
[22:13] candlesticks and in the midst of those
[22:15] seven candlesticks one liken to the son
[22:16] of man clothed with a garment down to
[22:18] the foot and gir about the PS with a
[22:21] golden girdle you may be seeing the Lord
[22:22] At His blessings to the reading of the
[22:24] word and then this morning and we'll
[22:25] read a little bit more Revelations 4
[22:28] because we didn't really get to the
[22:30] other part of this we're going to see
[22:32] these four beasts they're going to come
[22:33] back
[22:35] again that they're going to be shown
[22:37] again in the Book of Revelations and
[22:38] we'll see it just in a few minutes so
[22:40] Revelations 4:6 say Before the Throne
[22:42] there was sea of glass like into the
[22:44] Crystal and in the midst of the throne
[22:46] and round about The Throne were four
[22:47] beasts full of eyes before and behind
[22:51] and the first Beast was like a lion
[22:53] second beast like a calf third Beast had
[22:55] the face of a man and the fourth Beast
[22:57] was like a flying e
[22:59] so this message comes it's unsealed it's
[23:02] opened up to a group of people they see
[23:05] it they receive the message and you know
[23:07] what they get sealed away just as a
[23:09] messenger gets sealed away so does the
[23:13] people brother brand when he was beyond
[23:15] a curtain of time he said oh are these
[23:16] all brandom they said no they're your
[23:18] your converts he didn't see
[23:21] Paul's he didn't see irenes he didn't
[23:24] see Martin he saw his these are your
[23:28] converts
[23:29] these are the ones that's going to be
[23:30] together with you this is in other words
[23:32] these are your
[23:33] responsibility this is who you brought
[23:36] out from the quickening power of the
[23:39] message I gave you William brandham or
[23:41] I'm giving you William brandham by the
[23:42] time he had this Vision it was 1960 he
[23:44] had even started his message yet really
[23:46] his true
[23:47] message he said these are your people
[23:50] and they're the ones that's coming in
[23:51] under you and you'll be responsible for
[23:54] them right and then he said well did
[23:56] Paul make it so that say that assumes
[23:58] we're just going to assume not good to
[24:01] assume sometimes but if he would have
[24:03] seen Paul in his group he wouldn't ask
[24:04] that question but he said did Paul make
[24:06] it angel said yes Paul made it he said
[24:09] well I'll make it too cuz I preach what
[24:10] Paul preached and remember everybody
[24:12] else was saying what we're resting on
[24:14] that all right we're resting they were
[24:17] resting on and there's people that are
[24:20] and what a paradox I was thinking the
[24:21] other day all these
[24:24] Messengers and I'm sure that was false
[24:26] we can't see that because we don't have
[24:29] we're not uh previe to the information
[24:31] of irenius and Lutheran and even uh the
[24:34] opposition there was opposition in every
[24:35] age but we're we're granted an
[24:38] opportunity to see the opposition of
[24:40] brother brandham see what they're saying
[24:43] about him and it's blasted all over the
[24:45] Internet and these preachers that are
[24:48] that are preaching 30 years in a in a a
[24:51] church and and people get born
[24:54] again listen it doesn't it doesn't
[24:56] require somebody to be in the PO
[24:59] pit for you to get born
[25:03] again right that Born Again experience
[25:05] comes from you now there has to be
[25:07] somebody somebody teach
[25:10] you but the requirement is that you
[25:12] receive it cuz brother R said you can
[25:15] take an egg and put it under a dog and
[25:18] it'll hatch because it comes under a
[25:19] right condition well those people that
[25:21] this Minister you know not too far from
[25:23] here he 30 years preaching and I'm sure
[25:26] he buried people in the name of the Lord
[25:27] Jesus he he married people in the name
[25:29] of the Lord Jesus people got born again
[25:32] in his service I'm sure they did because
[25:34] they've carried on but then he denies
[25:36] every bit of that well there's a lot of
[25:38] people over in that sixth Dimension that
[25:41] he put over
[25:43] there he ain't going to get credit for
[25:45] him though the credit's going to go to
[25:48] brother
[25:49] brandom cuz he if he denies it here hey
[25:53] he ain't going there I'm sorry you deny
[25:56] this message and you're not going over
[25:58] there
[25:58] right you may be going over there but it
[26:00] ain't over there in the sixth Dimension
[26:01] all right so we thank God that we're in
[26:04] a different situation where we can we
[26:06] can visualize and see and see what
[26:08] they're saying about and stay away from
[26:09] it all right some of the others like
[26:11] we're going to cover in Luther where we
[26:13] watched the movie where Luther uh where
[26:15] he leaves and then all of his uh young
[26:17] preachers are tearing churches down and
[26:19] burning them and throwing the priests
[26:20] out in the yard and and Luther was like
[26:23] what are you doing they said well we're
[26:24] doing what you said do see they got a
[26:26] wrong Revelation it was right it was
[26:30] Luther had the right motive and
[26:31] objective they just didn't have the
[26:32] right motive and objective all right and
[26:34] they took it wrong for him to literally
[26:37] them to literally tear the churches up
[26:38] Luther was doing it spiritually get away
[26:41] from this break away from that they're
[26:43] not preaching the right gospel in other
[26:45] words he may have preached one day and
[26:46] said tear them all down well he didn't
[26:49] really mean to go tear those buildings
[26:50] down but they did take what he said
[26:54] sometimes that's not too bad sometimes
[26:55] it is bad so the messenger picks up the
[26:58] the mind of God he brings the message to
[27:01] us it's a message that you are
[27:04] identified with all right now we're
[27:06] identified with all of them every
[27:09] message we're identified with because we
[27:11] know the part listen to me we know the
[27:13] parts in
[27:14] pieces amen cuz see Luther's peace was
[27:18] the just shall live by faith but
[27:19] Luther's peace was peace of his ministry
[27:22] was not to restore us back to the faith
[27:25] of the fathers everybody with me
[27:28] right right his message was that just
[27:31] shall live by faith come out of her my
[27:33] people that was it now he preached he
[27:36] stood and preached and preached the uh
[27:38] trinitarian doctrine that peace is not
[27:41] the peace we get right but we surely get
[27:44] the one that Su just shall live by
[27:46] faith and see what Luther did bringing
[27:49] and telling them come out get out you
[27:50] know I wrote no those Theses come out of
[27:52] that church and because that church is
[27:55] going to kill you and actually he was
[27:57] the one that really cuz he remember he
[27:59] got excommunicated by the Pope the pope
[28:01] had him come in one time and we'll look
[28:03] at in the history but he didn't recant
[28:06] he went right on it didn't bother him
[28:09] one bit when he got a revelation that
[28:11] the pope wasn't his God and when we get
[28:13] to Revelation that no man on this Earth
[28:16] Is Our God God is our God then I promise
[28:20] you you will not have an issue with
[28:22] backing up with nobody you'll know where
[28:25] that power see we think power sometimes
[28:28] times is it's like brother Ram said
[28:29] we're going to walk in and just as you
[28:31] walk in the um northe Georgia Medical
[28:34] Center and everybody's just going to get
[28:36] healed
[28:38] no no power is you living an everyday
[28:42] life and having overcoming power over
[28:45] the devil amen amen cuz listen we're all
[28:49] Sinners saved by grace that's right
[28:51] brother BR said we sin every
[28:54] day but we have an advocate
[28:58] we have somebody to go to like brother
[29:00] Bob said quickly we go and say God
[29:03] forgive me for what I just did God
[29:06] forgive me for what I just did but in
[29:07] your soul if you're born again it never
[29:09] was a sinner amen amen never sinned a
[29:13] day in his life what you got to do is is
[29:15] believe that that man is going to take
[29:17] control of your life yes that's what you
[29:20] got to believe that that man is stronger
[29:24] than any other spirit that you had
[29:26] before cuz
[29:29] praise the I just saw that praise the
[29:31] Lord every Spirit you had just become
[29:33] weak when the Holy Ghost come in you got
[29:35] to realize that though and use it in
[29:37] your everyday life don't if that thing
[29:39] pops up that is the weak part the one
[29:42] that's inside of you is the strong part
[29:45] am amen it's the strong man of the house
[29:47] the Bible says but when he's but when
[29:50] he's not in
[29:52] there right when the strong man's not in
[29:54] there then they can tear the place apart
[29:56] but you get the strong man in there and
[29:59] every listen the strongest demon you
[30:01] ever
[30:02] had in your life when you were out in
[30:04] the world and you put your exyz in it
[30:06] whatever you want to do your laundry
[30:07] list mine's different from yours maybe
[30:09] the same but not one of them is as
[30:13] strong as the Holy Ghost you got
[30:15] now not one not one of them hey let me
[30:20] give you another thing not any of them
[30:23] together come on is more powerful than
[30:26] the Holy Ghost you got inside of you
[30:27] none of
[30:29] you said boy I just had to drink I had
[30:31] to smoke I had
[30:33] to that's a
[30:35] weakness that's a weak demon when he
[30:39] stands in front of a powerful God that's
[30:42] what we got to see that that power is
[30:43] already inside of you as I was talking
[30:45] about those those four living
[30:47] creatures they're there for a purpose
[30:50] you might need a lion one day you might
[30:52] need to be bold but you might need to be
[30:54] an ox one day to bear with somebody
[30:58] help somebody bear their
[31:01] burden and then you got to have
[31:03] intelligence God give me this kind of
[31:05] knowledge give you this kind of
[31:07] knowledge not Street knowledge not
[31:10] knowledge book knowledge but the
[31:12] knowledge
[31:14] that this is right and everything else
[31:16] is
[31:16] wrong that God did send us a prophet God
[31:20] did send us a message and this message
[31:22] is Right amen that's knowledge and
[31:25] listen that's past seven no that's past
[31:29] 7.98 76 billion other people in this
[31:32] world on absolutely I said
[31:36] billion when you look at all over the
[31:38] world you this message is only probably
[31:41] not even a DOT on the end of the
[31:43] sentence amen really born again people
[31:46] is about that all you got the little dot
[31:48] on the end of a pen amen but you're part
[31:51] of it and it's the most powerful thing
[31:54] that ever come on the face of the earth
[31:56] except for Jesus Christ that's right
[31:59] every Church age had a
[32:02] flaw we have flaws but God take it God's
[32:07] taking our flaws and making them right
[32:09] yes I'm like the old preacher if I'm not
[32:12] doing it right just hang on a little
[32:14] while let's just keep working and then
[32:16] we'll get it right cuz this is right
[32:19] this is
[32:20] wrong but if this is in here come on
[32:25] this is
[32:26] right this becomes right
[32:29] we sin every we have B you just had a
[32:31] bad thought just
[32:36] now boy Jo only the honest one in the
[32:38] whole place he's like yeah I
[32:42] did you never had a preacher stand here
[32:44] and just run right down your aisle and
[32:46] split your head wide open and you said
[32:48] oh praise the Lord thank you maybe later
[32:51] you did but it's the time you're like
[32:52] well bless God that no be under's doing
[32:54] the same thing why a't you talking about
[32:57] them
[32:58] he is they know
[33:01] that but how do you handle it it's how
[33:04] you handle it it's how you handle it
[33:07] it's like somebody told Dad not too long
[33:10] well you know back when he was preaching
[33:11] said you stepped on my toes he said well
[33:13] move
[33:14] them move
[33:17] them you said him I said him preach all
[33:19] day about drinking
[33:22] alcohol I hope it's a waste of time in
[33:25] this building
[33:28] Hall I hope it's a waste of time in this
[33:31] building right so that's why we don't
[33:33] preach on that amen am but now in other
[33:38] churches they may have to do that but
[33:40] not I'm not talking about other
[33:41] denominational churches but not in a
[33:42] message Church you should not have to
[33:44] keep going now y'all got get out of them
[33:46] liquor
[33:48] stores you got the liquor store demon
[33:51] out of you that's what you should have
[33:54] done that's why this is not a rehab
[33:57] facility
[34:00] never has it been a rehab the true
[34:02] church has never been a rehab
[34:04] facility it's been a delivering facility
[34:08] it's been a changing facility it's been
[34:11] your Earth has been
[34:13] changed when you come into this facility
[34:16] I don't mean this building I'm talking
[34:17] about come into the true baptism of the
[34:19] Holy Ghost righten when I got to New
[34:22] Birth I'm telling you I did not want any
[34:25] of that um skull or long cut straight
[34:28] skull and smoke I never smoked but
[34:30] Donnie
[34:32] did some of you others had different
[34:34] things
[34:35] right but when the Holy Ghost burnt that
[34:38] out I sure now listen it's like dad said
[34:41] he never like drank beer in his life
[34:42] never liked it but as soon as he got
[34:43] born again that beer look pretty good
[34:46] you know why that demon is trying
[34:48] another angle I don't know why I'm
[34:50] getting off on this but I'm doing anyway
[34:52] it's another angle he takes right right
[34:58] well you never drank that before but you
[34:59] might if you took a little drink it
[35:00] might be pretty good
[35:06] huh the Devil is a worthy adversary
[35:10] absolutely so you be careful brother R
[35:13] said you are no match for the
[35:15] devil but take this guy right
[35:19] here put it right here in the heart of a
[35:21] Believer brother R said you do that you
[35:23] got deity speaking so the Bible the word
[35:26] of God is speaking through you listen
[35:29] for years it was speaking to you now
[35:32] let's get it where it's speaking through
[35:35] you sure we we we've absorbed years of
[35:40] Doctrine years of
[35:42] preaching probably thousands of sermons
[35:46] now let's start pushing it about the
[35:47] other out the other side start living it
[35:49] start making it
[35:53] work so the trumpet sounds a messages
[35:56] proclaimed well listen if there's a
[35:57] message should got to be somebody to
[35:58] listen to
[36:00] it and say as as hady R says that ain't
[36:03] nothing but the
[36:06] truth listen she meant it so much come
[36:10] on till God honored anything she said
[36:13] brother R said that sister would have
[36:15] got up out of the wheelchair she'd asked
[36:16] for a million dollars it have been on
[36:18] the table she could have asked whatever
[36:20] the Holy Ghost said you tell her ask
[36:21] whatever she
[36:23] wants and it changed the course of two
[36:25] sons lives right amen
[36:29] amen thank you Jesus and she probably
[36:33] had soap on her hands dishwashing
[36:35] detergent all over her hand sisters I'm
[36:37] going down your aisle right now probably
[36:38] had an apron on her hair was probably
[36:41] not all fixed up real nice she was
[36:44] serving the prophet
[36:46] dinner and heard him
[36:48] talking I don't think brother R was even
[36:50] talking to her but she said brother B
[36:52] that ain't nothing but the truth and
[36:54] what she done is she opened a portal
[36:57] from eternity to here just a little
[37:00] woman that says that a and she you know
[37:02] what though she believed it we can say
[37:03] it all we want to she believed it was a
[37:06] truth I mean that substance that brother
[37:09] rown was talking about became real
[37:10] because she said she said that ain't
[37:12] nothing but the truth it it broke the
[37:14] Airways there was a
[37:16] message and what did God do he turned
[37:19] around and gave whatever she needed
[37:21] that's what he gave to her in other
[37:23] words as we were we're going to talk
[37:25] about the seals he opened up the seals
[37:28] opening up the seals to a group of
[37:29] people in
[37:30] 1963 was I don't say useless but it was
[37:33] not useless it was supposed to been at
[37:35] their time but it helped nobody then I'm
[37:39] telling you what a prophet said he's
[37:40] gone from you not even for you not even
[37:43] for you right
[37:45] listen this is for you cuz I'm handing
[37:48] it to you okay give me that back give me
[37:53] a right but if it's not for you it's
[37:57] from somebody else see I give this to
[38:00] Michael cuz I said that's his but if I
[38:02] give it to him and brother Donnie's done
[38:04] drank out of it I'm sure he's not going
[38:05] to drink out of it but brother randam
[38:08] maybe you are you but brother randam was
[38:10] preaching to a group of people I know
[38:12] Daddy Fountain
[38:13] wouldn't make you sick make you sick
[38:15] just thinking about
[38:17] it we got to chew each other's chewing
[38:19] gun remember and not you first not you
[38:24] first but if it's not for you you're not
[38:26] going to get it
[38:28] that's but these things are for
[38:31] us these things are for us to grab a
[38:33] hold of and they're laying out there and
[38:35] sometimes we just keep them and let them
[38:36] lay there remember sitting on the
[38:39] premises Standing on the
[38:40] Promises let's just don't come in and
[38:42] sit on the premises on your
[38:44] premise and expect God to do something
[38:48] no that's right no so that message was
[38:52] proclaimed and it was distinct and
[38:54] declared just like the lonox man and the
[38:56] eagle there was there's an anointing God
[38:59] has what
[39:00] dispensations see the dispensation of
[39:02] the Holy Ghost in 1906 isusa Street was
[39:05] that the gifts were going to come back
[39:06] the Holy Ghost was going to fall on a
[39:08] group of
[39:09] people all right regardless if they were
[39:12] trinitarians regardless if they were uh
[39:15] baptized in the name of father son holy
[39:16] ghost that was the time everybody with
[39:19] me because it's going to be important
[39:21] that there was a time for every one of
[39:22] these
[39:23] things and everything had to line up and
[39:26] fit at the same time that's right and
[39:29] God's never been
[39:31] off he's always been on time that's
[39:34] right so he brings a message group of
[39:36] people's already there I believe right
[39:39] now there's 144,000 over there and those
[39:41] two prophets they just have not been
[39:43] anointed
[39:45] yet amen I believe that cuz it's that
[39:49] close they don't have to raise them for
[39:51] babies I believe they're over there now
[39:54] and getting ready but they can't do
[39:55] anything you you say well boy if they
[39:57] heard the message of the
[39:59] hour remember brother Brandon was going
[40:02] overseas he was going to Israel he said
[40:05] I'm going over there he said you bring
[40:07] them people think about a prophet he
[40:10] said you take them out on the plane in
[40:12] other words take them out there where
[40:13] Moses
[40:14] was and he said we'll
[40:18] see so you know what God let him do God
[40:21] let him get to
[40:22] Egypt he was getting his extra ticket to
[40:24] go to Israel and the Lord said
[40:29] if he had went over there it had broke
[40:30] scripture it had broke time element it
[40:32] would have broke everything in the
[40:35] Bible but you know what God did let him
[40:37] get to Egypt that's right he didn't tell
[40:40] him over in Jeffersonville no you don't
[40:41] need to do that no he let him think
[40:42] about it he looked and then when then
[40:44] when it was time he said he took me
[40:46] behind their hanger there and said hey
[40:48] not yet time man they would accepted
[40:51] that cuz see that's what they're looking
[40:52] for they're looking for
[40:54] Elijah and if they would have seen that
[40:58] and now I know that you know there was a
[40:59] message Church in Israel at one time but
[41:01] I think he's done quit the message right
[41:04] Solomon Jacob didn't mean to bring his
[41:06] name out but he preached here before one
[41:09] time he's not meant he denied the
[41:11] message you think he'd be over there in
[41:14] the right place that ain't the right
[41:15] place for a message believer to
[41:17] be hello somebody that's right I mean
[41:21] they can and they may have a church
[41:22] somewhere over there pretty close but
[41:24] that this message is not for them people
[41:26] at this moment that's right amen it's a
[41:30] time so then then God has a time he has
[41:32] a declared message it comes at a
[41:34] distinct time in the in the in the um
[41:37] economy of God cuz when we get out of
[41:40] here immediately when we get out of here
[41:42] God's going to open their
[41:46] eyes is he going to open a little bit I
[41:48] don't know those two prophets brother
[41:52] bam said a prophet was born a prophet
[41:53] but see they're anointed by the mees by
[41:55] the Moses and Elijah they're anointed by
[41:58] those two anointings so they got to wait
[42:00] till that
[42:03] comes several message Believers several
[42:06] years ago was like we need to go to
[42:07] Israel we need to get stay out of the
[42:10] place it's not us I'm
[42:14] sorry why don't you go on the street
[42:16] corner and do it here in America this is
[42:18] where the Gentiles need to be gleaned
[42:19] not over there in
[42:21] Israel there are going to be Jews that
[42:23] come in I guarantee you they will be but
[42:26] not like the 44,000 and it's not going
[42:28] to accelerate God's
[42:30] program he has a
[42:33] program we got to leave before they go
[42:36] over there that's it
[42:38] period God's waiting on us to get in
[42:40] line but he knows exactly when that's
[42:43] going to happen he's going to have them
[42:45] ready I was thinking going to Kentucky
[42:47] the other morning I was watching the
[42:49] traffic
[42:51] flow you know how we pray I hope you
[42:53] pray when you get behind the wheel of a
[42:55] car if you don't you need to start cuz
[42:58] you know what God may bump your head
[43:00] every once in a while and remind you
[43:02] that you need to pray before you I mean
[43:04] maybe bump your
[43:06] car I pray every time I get in the car
[43:09] to go on a trip and I pray on the way
[43:11] back home that God will make keep it
[43:14] safe do you know he can orchestrate
[43:16] every bit of those cars at one time
[43:19] absolutely there was thousands of people
[43:21] going through Nashville and I said Lord
[43:22] you are you got Angels orchestrating
[43:24] this whole thing so that nobody cuz you
[43:26] know what the devil want to do do he
[43:27] wants to kill you as soon as you walk
[43:28] out the door if y'all don't believe that
[43:30] or not there's a fight going on that you
[43:32] hadn't seen
[43:34] before that you probably would get
[43:36] scared to death if you did see it that
[43:38] as soon as you grab your door knob about
[43:41] 10,000 demons wake
[43:43] up that's right and they're not there
[43:46] for your health that's right they're
[43:48] there for your
[43:49] demise and without without
[43:53] god without God protecting us every day
[43:56] because listen we're that we're that
[43:58] kind of people that that that uh you
[44:01] take somebody like the FBI CIA you're on
[44:04] the
[44:05] radar and they watch every move you make
[44:08] them demons are the same way head demon
[44:12] he wants us all gone anyway he hates to
[44:15] feel what you and I have sure he can
[44:18] feel an anointing I'm talking about the
[44:20] power that's in this message the true
[44:22] word of God that he can't get come on
[44:25] people he can't get in
[44:28] there he can play everywhere else but he
[44:30] can't get inside of your soul if you're
[44:33] born again he can't tamper with the true
[44:35] word of God sure he try to make it false
[44:38] but the truth is always going to come
[44:40] out that's why you got an opposition a
[44:43] war a war is two opposing forces I've
[44:46] never seen anybody fight a war with both
[44:48] of them having the same
[44:51] agenda no it's two different agendas two
[44:55] different mindsets do different things
[44:57] that's why they're fighting and that was
[44:59] why I was going down the road you see
[45:00] all them cars and I'm like man devil I
[45:04] know you want to take two or three of
[45:06] them cars and just move them over this
[45:07] way and mash me and kill me and all that
[45:09] I said but greater is he that's in me
[45:13] and he that's in that demon right there
[45:16] that demon is just a little minion that
[45:17] does what head demon tells it to do and
[45:20] head demon don't do nothing tell the
[45:22] head God tells him what to do so he
[45:25] can't touch you that's you but you
[45:27] better pray when you drive when you see
[45:30] those thousands of cars and you see them
[45:31] moving I almost saw an accident almost
[45:34] hit a motorcycle but he was coming four
[45:36] lanes over and he got about right here
[45:38] but you see
[45:39] there something slowed you down
[45:42] something sped you up something moved
[45:45] you over
[45:46] absolutely you think boy I don't know
[45:48] you you're just too no listen the life
[45:50] of a Christian number one is a unique
[45:54] life and number two you don't see what
[45:57] goes on for God to keep you away from
[46:00] being
[46:01] killed every day every hour you say boy
[46:04] that was a close call that ain't
[46:07] luck none of it
[46:09] is you stop and thank
[46:13] God that he protected you through that
[46:15] accident or even if even if you do get
[46:17] in an accident well the great miracle
[46:18] you do get in an accident and they're
[46:19] like whoa you didn't even have a
[46:22] scratch well there was an angel there
[46:26] pushing the glass out of the way pushing
[46:28] the pushing the metal out of the way or
[46:31] or pushing whatever
[46:32] comes I don't know where this come from
[46:35] but it's something you need to do you
[46:38] need to thank God and be aware that we
[46:40] have Angels around us both good and
[46:44] bad both good and bad but the good will
[46:47] always overcome the
[46:49] Baden if we yield to the good and just
[46:52] forget the bad
[46:57] so The Messengers laid away and so are
[46:58] the people of that age they're laid away
[47:01] into the sixth Dimension the place of
[47:02] holding where they're there with their
[47:04] messenger I'm sure that whoever's always
[47:07] all gone before they're sitting around
[47:09] brother bradam and they're talking to
[47:12] him and and and conversing back and
[47:14] forth they're just not sitting there on
[47:16] the
[47:17] cloud he saw people
[47:20] running he saw people coming over the
[47:23] hill so it must be a little Hill over
[47:25] there in the sixth dimension
[47:27] how Vivid is it wasn't his
[47:29] imagination he saw it it was real that's
[47:32] a real place listen that's more real
[47:35] than this one yes it way more real than
[47:37] this place we're just in a place that we
[47:40] have this right here because we're
[47:41] slowed down to a point that that's hard
[47:44] but when we speed up that was another
[47:46] thing I was thinking I thought man all
[47:47] this stuff's coming through my car I'm
[47:50] picking up radio stations as I go
[47:51] there's different radio stations cuz one
[47:53] kind of fizzes out and the other one
[47:54] picks up right
[47:57] if y'all don't travel then that's
[47:58] exactly what happens okay same way with
[48:00] your cell phones used to you know you
[48:02] get to a place you went have on cell
[48:03] phone service like mazille
[48:06] Georgia they need a mayor but I'll talk
[48:10] to
[48:11] Richard but that's all going through
[48:14] your car every bit of
[48:17] that where's them voices coming
[48:21] from where's it singing coming from
[48:24] where's that preaching coming from it's
[48:25] the voice you're listening to right
[48:26] that's right it must have some kind of
[48:28] substance where's it coming from it's
[48:30] coming from a faster Dimension it's so
[48:32] fast it's coming through your closed
[48:34] window
[48:36] yes am I crazy here or what it's coming
[48:39] right through there so listen there is
[48:42] then some substance that you can be
[48:44] changed to yes that'll put you through a
[48:51] wall change in a moment the twinkling of
[48:54] an eye yes sir well I don't know where
[48:57] that come from either but let's go
[48:58] through
[49:00] here yes it is true and we need to be
[49:03] aware sufficiently impressed are aware
[49:07] that this whole thing is being
[49:08] orchestrated by
[49:10] God if you're a born again chrisan he's
[49:13] going to take care of his kids if you're
[49:16] not he's not obligated to he's only
[49:20] obligated to his own children that's
[49:23] right brother Dale said many years ago
[49:25] he said God's not going to adopt the
[49:26] devil
[49:27] kids no he's just not going to do that
[49:30] he'll adopt his kids but he's not going
[49:33] to adopt the devil's kids but when you
[49:35] become one of his you come under his
[49:39] adoption you come under the headship
[49:42] he's your head and man it just works out
[49:44] it just works
[49:46] out and I believe we're heading towards
[49:48] something that works
[49:49] out this Rapture is going to take place
[49:52] this body change is going to happen
[49:54] we're going to come to a place not that
[49:56] we not to sinless Perfection don't ever
[49:58] think
[49:59] that but in God's eyes we never sin a
[50:02] day in our
[50:03] life if you're born
[50:05] again and the filter of God from him to
[50:09] us there's that
[50:12] blood there's that blood that he shed at
[50:15] Calvary that brother R said he hears
[50:17] your voice through the blood but he said
[50:20] if he' see you every day in your
[50:21] everyday life he' have to kill
[50:25] you amen
[50:27] thank God for a prophet that tell us
[50:29] these things but you know what
[50:30] everything he says made
[50:32] sense everybody with me toight you
[50:34] listen to same Prophet I do everything
[50:36] he said made sense you're
[50:38] like why didn't I think of that well
[50:41] you're thinking of it now yes through
[50:44] the filter of the word of God through
[50:46] ministers through the five-fold ministry
[50:48] you're getting
[50:50] it I hope you're getting it I hope we're
[50:54] getting it I hope we're all getting that
[50:56] there's not yeah there is something
[50:58] great coming but there's something great
[51:01] here but if you don't realize it it's
[51:04] going to continue on and you're going to
[51:06] be left right
[51:07] here brother B said you you latter rain
[51:10] people they're looking for a latter rain
[51:12] they were over here in the rapturing
[51:14] part cuz latter rain is a harvest rain
[51:17] right he said you ain't even had to
[51:19] former rain yet cuz you know why he was
[51:21] the former Reign his preaching teaching
[51:24] was the former Reign but they thought
[51:26] they were already over
[51:29] here well you know who told them that
[51:31] some preacher
[51:33] did and they accepted it CU it sounded
[51:35] good and felt good but when brother M
[51:38] stood there and said that boy didn't it
[51:39] sting them it stung their uh idea and
[51:43] thought it stung them because they're
[51:45] like oh wait a minute we're over here
[51:47] brother said you Ain even had this yet
[51:50] that's why they rejected him that's why
[51:51] there's a spiritual
[51:53] war every time a preacher preaches
[51:55] there's a spiritual War cuz if he brings
[51:58] out something in our life come on that's
[52:01] a
[52:02] war it's to opposing things fighting
[52:06] each
[52:10] other let go and let
[52:12] God let go and let God yes sir take self
[52:17] out of the
[52:19] way get rid of oursel get rid of our
[52:23] thoughts and ideas amen and put it in
[52:26] the word of God that's the message of
[52:29] the hour you can take all the other
[52:30] things and the great doctrines which is
[52:31] fine but you will never understand these
[52:34] great doctrines without the Holy Ghost
[52:35] you'll never understand these great
[52:37] doctrines without the teaching of the
[52:39] message of the hour that's right won't
[52:43] happen and your results will always be
[52:47] wrong if you start wrong right you got
[52:50] to come to right
[52:52] somewhere wrong can't be right without
[52:56] something in between making it
[52:58] right cuz wrong stays wrong and right
[53:00] stays right but if you bring right in
[53:02] and you and you realize that and you
[53:04] taking in say God I'm sorry I I had a
[53:07] problem now I don't or I didn't
[53:09] understand this quote or I didn't
[53:11] understand this Doctrine or I didn't
[53:12] understand the scripture but now I
[53:14] understand it listen that's a powerful
[53:18] Revelation that's something the devil
[53:20] has never figured
[53:22] out come on somebody when you get a
[53:25] revelation that didn't come from the
[53:28] devil that come from God and Satan is
[53:32] absolutely sealed out of that thing he
[53:35] can't see
[53:36] it he's an
[53:39] unbeliever well he believes
[53:41] himself but he's an
[53:46] unbeliever we're going to skip all
[53:48] through this cuz I want to get to
[53:51] something now remember the messages that
[53:53] we saw we come to pergamus I want you to
[53:55] see this in pergamus so one more time
[53:58] that what happened the two churches are
[54:01] bearing the same name but with a bitter
[54:03] difference between them one has departed
[54:05] from the truth married idols and has no
[54:07] life in her we're talking about the
[54:08] paman church age because that's going to
[54:11] give birth to the th tyan Church age
[54:14] right everybody with me on that all
[54:16] right the Third Church age everything
[54:18] starts morphing in the other
[54:20] direction just as the IMM morphe of God
[54:23] is in um uh um columb or the one before
[54:28] Martin Satan is in morph too he's in
[54:31] morphed into a Roman Catholic Church
[54:33] he's in morphate into church and state
[54:36] putting them together and they got power
[54:40] now but the little church never had that
[54:43] the little church had the word of God
[54:45] and that little church was laid
[54:47] away see she has hybridized herself and
[54:50] the signs of death not life follow in
[54:52] her weight she's powerful many members
[54:55] favored by the world the other is a
[54:58] little persecuted group but she follows
[55:00] the word and the signs follow her the
[55:03] sick are healed the dead or raised she
[55:05] is alive with life and the word of God
[55:07] she loves not her life but holds to his
[55:09] name and his faith even unto death that
[55:12] was the pergan church age then you go
[55:14] we're going into the dark ages in just a
[55:15] few minutes and see just for a minute
[55:18] that Dark Ages it was a long time it
[55:20] took a long time to go through that to
[55:23] to weed all that out for Luther to step
[55:25] on the scene
[55:27] because remember Luther was part of that
[55:30] system Luther was part of that system
[55:32] that killed all those Christians he was
[55:35] a
[55:36] Catholic he had to get have a
[55:40] conversion so the for living creatures
[55:42] we were talking about this morning I
[55:43] think we kind of covered it pretty well
[55:45] but there's one thing I want you to see
[55:46] that I didn't cover two things I want
[55:48] you to
[55:49] see you remember from this this morning
[55:51] I hope you
[55:52] did that those living creatures are
[55:54] inside of you that's your everyday work
[55:58] life of of of being born again those are
[56:01] in your life and you know what you use
[56:04] them and you don't even know
[56:07] it you use them and you don't even know
[56:09] it okay but God knows it that's why I
[56:12] put them
[56:13] there if you had to sit there and figure
[56:15] out which one no you just use it use
[56:21] your Holy Ghost
[56:23] amen so there were four beasts full of
[56:25] eyes before behind now let's get to the
[56:27] Book of Revelations first was a lion the
[56:29] second was a calf third was man fourth
[56:32] one was an eagle is everybody with me on
[56:34] that all right they had wings and they
[56:36] were zoons and then you got the ones
[56:38] that are theion beast which is an
[56:40] untameable Beast now listen all of us
[56:43] were born a wild untamable
[56:46] beast but it took a the zoom it took a
[56:48] living creature to come in and clean all
[56:50] that out and then put the nature of God
[56:54] inside of you everybody with the nature
[56:56] let me say it one more time the nature
[56:58] of almighty God is inside of you at the
[57:00] new birth all
[57:03] right and listen weren't you
[57:07] dead in sin and trespass sir weren't you
[57:12] dead as a as a
[57:14] sinner you were born dead everybody with
[57:17] me you were dead without Christ you were
[57:20] you dead you were ding you going on but
[57:23] thank God he sent those he sent those
[57:25] combat Beast see because we're going to
[57:28] take them now remember they were four
[57:30] living creatures everybody with me all
[57:33] right wake up just a second the four
[57:35] living creatures all right now they come
[57:38] over here and watch in the Scripture it
[57:40] shows here it says that they were four
[57:46] beasts hold on Ezekiel said four living
[57:51] creatures you come over in
[57:53] Revelations you see beasts for
[57:58] Beast now hang on a
[58:01] minute everybody with
[58:07] me and where were they they were in the
[58:11] people all right four living same one
[58:14] same thing but watch the verbiage four
[58:16] living creatures he Ezekiel did not have
[58:19] the Holy Ghost to interpet what that was
[58:21] right
[58:22] right but John comes over here and watch
[58:25] what he does he looks and he sees two
[58:27] different
[58:29] powers so there's two different beasts
[58:32] in Revelations there's not one over here
[58:34] in Ezekiel it's all put together living
[58:36] creatures in symbols to help the people
[58:40] all right but you come over here and
[58:41] John's looking at and he says hey those
[58:43] are four beasts because hey guess
[58:46] what they're in opposition to these
[58:48] theion beasts cuz a beast Rises up from
[58:51] the United States a beast Rises up here
[58:53] and speaks and he ain't a good one
[58:56] right that's why the the people when
[58:59] they wrote the the in the Greek one's a
[59:01] theion beast and one's a zoon it says
[59:05] Beast better
[59:07] watch so we know where they're at now I
[59:09] got them kind of fixed where you can see
[59:10] them lonox man an
[59:12] eagle the lion was in what the first
[59:14] three Church ages the middle Church age
[59:16] was the ox we'll see that in just a
[59:18] minute and then the man anointing was
[59:20] the two men Luther and Wesley that came
[59:23] on the earth that had the intelligence
[59:25] to put it in Bible for him you I didn't
[59:28] know I was read been reading the um the
[59:30] history of this all these people that
[59:32] and not even just there's different
[59:34] people that we got a church AE messenger
[59:36] and brother B puts him up here there a
[59:37] lot of people down here that does a lot
[59:39] of
[59:40] work what it uh tendale William tendale
[59:44] put the Bible together you know they
[59:45] drug him through the street and killed
[59:46] him
[59:48] right for
[59:50] that not cuz they didn't like him and he
[59:53] had some bad dinner or something or he
[59:54] treated somebody wrong for him putting
[59:56] the Bible together and getting it
[59:57] printed they drug him through the street
[59:59] and killed him William tendel see you
[1:00:02] see all those that are martyred that
[1:00:04] that that that they're going to get a
[1:00:05] crown
[1:00:06] too but you don't hear from them much
[1:00:08] because they're not Church age
[1:00:09] Messengers but but thank God there's
[1:00:11] people working St Patrick St Patrick did
[1:00:14] a lot of
[1:00:15] work before even Columba comes in on the
[1:00:19] picture but but Columba comes in and
[1:00:21] sits down on top of what St Patrick did
[1:00:24] Brother Ram comes in and sits right
[1:00:26] there on top of all the other ones he
[1:00:27] talks about FF Bosworth all the
[1:00:30] different ones he names them
[1:00:31] all he never calls them that says
[1:00:34] they're Antichrist
[1:00:36] no dght Moody he said sent millions of
[1:00:39] souls to Heaven that's what he said
[1:00:43] Dwight Moody Dwight Moody was probably a
[1:00:46] trinitarian you see how God works though
[1:00:48] it's his sovereignty to work any way he
[1:00:50] wants to and bring his people in That's
[1:00:54] supposed to be brought in under their
[1:00:57] messenger that's why the brother R made
[1:00:59] that clear under under our messenger
[1:01:02] were the final voice of the final age
[1:01:04] cuz he was the final voice amen but
[1:01:07] under him we're the final voice to the F
[1:01:09] to the
[1:01:09] age everybody with
[1:01:12] me I'm going to say this and say this
[1:01:14] real quiet brother brandham was in the L
[1:01:18] in church age is everybody with me so
[1:01:20] are we but remember we called out of the
[1:01:23] age but remember there's a each Eternal
[1:01:26] age that we're heading to and we're
[1:01:29] farther over this way than he
[1:01:31] was everybody with me let me explain
[1:01:35] that he died
[1:01:36] 1965 obviously the Rapture is not taking
[1:01:41] place laid away we ain't gone farther
[1:01:45] than brother Brandon we just TimeWise
[1:01:46] have went further you hear me
[1:01:49] TimeWise why cuz there was no message
[1:01:52] churches in 1965
[1:01:55] when he died half of his people that was
[1:01:58] that you hear on tape went back to
[1:01:59] denominations they had nowhere to go and
[1:02:02] I believe they had the Holy
[1:02:05] Ghost well don't get
[1:02:08] quiet but God has
[1:02:11] dispensations and I believe when brother
[1:02:13] brandham talked about 1977 that there
[1:02:15] was a dispensational change it wasn't
[1:02:17] that the Rapture was going to take place
[1:02:18] we missed what he said but that was a
[1:02:20] dispensational change now you and I are
[1:02:22] in the real Church age you and I are
[1:02:24] supposed to be in right
[1:02:26] and we're recipients of that and we have
[1:02:28] been for some 50 and 60 years we've been
[1:02:31] in that final voice to the final age cuz
[1:02:34] that voice didn't sound back in
[1:02:36] 47 I'm talking about this
[1:02:39] voice this
[1:02:41] voice that was a restoration voice this
[1:02:44] voice is a carrying out of here voice
[1:02:46] this is a rapturing faith voice this is
[1:02:49] a body chain voice this is a powerful
[1:02:52] voice that's going to get everybody out
[1:02:54] of the ground that's waiting on us
[1:02:57] so
[1:02:58] yes yes we went past the prophet but
[1:03:01] only in time right not in
[1:03:04] Revelation you will never go past
[1:03:06] brother Brown in Revelation we got to
[1:03:09] understand what he said
[1:03:12] already amen everybody all right with
[1:03:15] that but we're in the eagle anointing
[1:03:17] age I don't believe that eagle anointing
[1:03:20] was in 1962 3 and 4 if if it had been
[1:03:23] brother R said you're all getting what
[1:03:25] I'm saying
[1:03:26] man I y'all ain't got no problem you
[1:03:28] getting everything I'm saying no he
[1:03:31] stands up in 63 and questions and
[1:03:33] answers he said you're not getting
[1:03:35] it he said it's not for you he even said
[1:03:38] it's gone from you what did it do it
[1:03:41] sealed back
[1:03:43] up it sealed back up for that group of
[1:03:46] people but they were all born
[1:03:49] again that's like when we get over into
[1:03:51] the major doctrin you we talk about
[1:03:52] marriage and divorce and we may have to
[1:03:55] tie people down and keep him here but
[1:03:57] marriage and divorce is a sticky
[1:03:59] situation but brother Brown said this is
[1:04:01] to my followers
[1:04:03] only only don't try to tell somebody
[1:04:06] about marriage and divorce that Ain
[1:04:08] that's out in the world they look at you
[1:04:10] cross-side that's right you can't talk
[1:04:12] about denomination no but God had to
[1:04:15] give us a Grace yes he knew we'd be in
[1:04:18] the shape we're in he knew we were
[1:04:20] because of misinterpreted
[1:04:22] theology he knew that because when times
[1:04:24] pass we were in the the lust of the
[1:04:26] Flesh and did all that back in
[1:04:28] there but he gave a Grace thank you Lord
[1:04:32] so that there'd be enough people left to
[1:04:34] be able to preach the
[1:04:37] message and take a body
[1:04:40] change that's the grace that God give us
[1:04:43] through a prophet but it's to his
[1:04:45] followers only not to the whole world
[1:04:48] you can't just claim it that's
[1:04:51] greasy you got to really know it was for
[1:04:54] you claim it but don't ever do it
[1:04:57] again everybody with me all right so
[1:05:00] that's just kind of a little but it's
[1:05:02] but it's it's for here only it's for his
[1:05:05] followers that's what he said and you
[1:05:07] know what you know who he was talking
[1:05:10] to Sister CET were y'all there were you
[1:05:14] there a marriage and divorce yes okay I
[1:05:17] would I would I'm not going to assume
[1:05:19] sister CL was born
[1:05:20] again there was born again people in
[1:05:24] that building he wasn't talking to the
[1:05:27] barrooms he wasn't talking to a lot of
[1:05:29] Sinners they were a lot of people he
[1:05:31] said if he says this is to my people
[1:05:33] only they must have been message
[1:05:34] Believers at that point in time
[1:05:36] everybody with
[1:05:37] me you say no he's talking about Sinners
[1:05:40] they just living like dogs and he give
[1:05:41] them a Grace no these are born again
[1:05:44] people that had made a boo boo yes and
[1:05:47] was sitting in that congregation they
[1:05:49] made a mistake and he said go on as you
[1:05:53] are but don't ever do it again
[1:05:56] right that was a Grace for his people
[1:05:59] that was a Grace for people that had the
[1:06:01] Holy
[1:06:03] Ghost there's not Grace for people out
[1:06:06] there right it's God's grace they're
[1:06:09] still alive yeah but but but as far as
[1:06:12] marriage and divorce man you I mean even
[1:06:14] in a in a regular
[1:06:17] Church there's divorce counselors and
[1:06:20] there you know it's just just become so
[1:06:22] easy to get a drive-thru divorce till
[1:06:24] you know but we don't believe in that
[1:06:27] but we do believe in
[1:06:28] grace listen Paul gave a Grace let me
[1:06:31] tell you this way Paul gave a Grace to
[1:06:33] set everything back in order while he
[1:06:35] was there everybody with me remember the
[1:06:37] guy was married to his mother or his
[1:06:38] stepmother-in-law or step something you
[1:06:41] understand what I'm talking about if you
[1:06:42] look in Corinthians you'll see it and
[1:06:44] then he become on to be a good person
[1:06:45] over here a little bit later in second
[1:06:47] Corinthians you read what brother B says
[1:06:49] about him get straightened up he
[1:06:51] said but Paul had to give one to get
[1:06:54] everything you know what do you call it
[1:06:55] a kind of a checkup you know where you
[1:06:57] pull everything you check everything up
[1:06:59] then now from Paul to us though it got
[1:07:01] the Gap got wider misinterpreted
[1:07:04] theology comes in and makes that Gap
[1:07:07] wider but without a Grace over here
[1:07:10] listen without a Grace you wouldn't hear
[1:07:12] a lot of
[1:07:18] preaching I claimed the grace of
[1:07:20] marriage and divorce cuz I needed it
[1:07:25] and if you didn't then praise God you
[1:07:27] were married to the wrong person when
[1:07:29] you woke up out of your mama's womb so
[1:07:32] we all need that Grace all right but to
[1:07:35] make everything come back and to ratchet
[1:07:37] it back to to
[1:07:39] zero it had to be a Prophet come on the
[1:07:41] same Paul had to come in Jesus had to
[1:07:43] come in Moses had to come in and give a
[1:07:45] Grace so he come over here in the end
[1:07:46] time and it had got so far away till
[1:07:48] brother R had to stop say hey but he had
[1:07:51] to go up on a mountain he didn't just
[1:07:53] get it out of a book he went upon a
[1:07:56] mountain and God said okay tell them
[1:07:59] people we're going to have a marker
[1:08:01] right here and that marker is going to
[1:08:03] be right here and if you go past that
[1:08:06] marker again there ain't another Prophet
[1:08:08] going to come on the scene that's right
[1:08:10] and give you another Grace this is it
[1:08:14] that's why that's why he said I'm
[1:08:15] shaking what listen to the sermon he
[1:08:18] said I'm shaking he said my insides are
[1:08:20] shaking he said you don't know what this
[1:08:22] means he did but a lot of people didn't
[1:08:24] but he did he knew what that meant he
[1:08:27] was almost forgiving those people for
[1:08:29] what they'
[1:08:32] Done
[1:08:34] Right remember that woman said brother
[1:08:36] BR said said you you know you like God
[1:08:39] well brother B said honey read the Bible
[1:08:43] the Bible says who sins you remit
[1:08:45] they're remitted who sins remain they he
[1:08:47] C out of the
[1:08:50] Bible I don't know where that came from
[1:08:52] but let's get started here
[1:08:56] but there's a time that everything
[1:08:58] restitution there's a time of
[1:08:59] restitution for everything everything's
[1:09:00] got to come back to zero all right we
[1:09:03] got to make all wrongs right and try not
[1:09:05] to ever do it again oh no don't ever do
[1:09:08] it again all right so look now we've
[1:09:11] come to the children of
[1:09:12] Israel and back in Ezekiel you were
[1:09:15] talking about the living creatures and
[1:09:16] then Paul comes up I mean U John comes
[1:09:18] up and he sees two opposing forces he
[1:09:21] sees a beast over there and a beast over
[1:09:23] here four of them
[1:09:26] all right you know why because if you
[1:09:28] read book of Revelations we're going to
[1:09:29] read it here in just a second Revelation
[1:09:31] 6 verse1 says let's read it now that's
[1:09:34] where one of them comes up that I didn't
[1:09:35] show you this morning and I saw when the
[1:09:37] lamb opened one of the seals oh this is
[1:09:40] coming to be a great
[1:09:42] time cuz the seals are fixing to be open
[1:09:44] they never been open before he didn't
[1:09:47] entrust it to nobody but one of those
[1:09:49] four
[1:09:50] beast and I heard it was the noise of
[1:09:53] Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:09:56] come and
[1:09:58] see that's how important those beasts
[1:10:01] are right there was a beast in four
[1:10:04] openings of the
[1:10:06] seals there was four horse
[1:10:09] riders and you know how brother BR came
[1:10:11] to a revelation that the Rapture takes
[1:10:13] place on the fourth seal he said the
[1:10:15] combat beasts are
[1:10:17] gone come on the combat Beast are gone
[1:10:20] well if the combat Beast are gone then
[1:10:22] the Holy Ghost is lifted off the Earth
[1:10:24] and if it's inside of you it took you
[1:10:26] with
[1:10:28] it everybody with me on that so those
[1:10:31] beasts are important but that's not a
[1:10:33] theion
[1:10:35] beast that's a zoom that's a living
[1:10:40] creature everybody with me on that
[1:10:45] okay so remember what happened when John
[1:10:48] watching the Ark of the Covenant now
[1:10:50] remember when John sees a vision in in
[1:10:53] Revelations he don't see an ark he sees
[1:10:55] a
[1:10:56] throne everybody with me on this wake up
[1:10:58] for a
[1:11:00] minute he sees he sees a man sitting on
[1:11:03] the throne he doesn't see a
[1:11:06] wheel that's in ezekiel's time that's
[1:11:09] the four living creatures he can't name
[1:11:11] them all right he literally I don't
[1:11:15] think Ezekiel knew how that all fit
[1:11:16] together in that
[1:11:18] picture he didn't have a holy
[1:11:20] ghost He listen he was just truly a
[1:11:23] mouthpiece for God to drop down and
[1:11:25] speak through him and then remember what
[1:11:28] uh brother r or some preacher said that
[1:11:30] that Isaiah stood up and said preaching
[1:11:32] and he said a virgin shall
[1:11:35] conceive he said he probably went home
[1:11:37] and his wife was like what are you
[1:11:38] talking
[1:11:39] about where'd you get that from and he
[1:11:42] probably scratched his head why because
[1:11:44] the anointing came off of him he become
[1:11:46] a regular Man without that Revelation
[1:11:49] again everybody with me so that's the
[1:11:52] same way he works the same way now but
[1:11:54] see we now as John had the Holy Ghost
[1:11:56] Inside of us the ark is inside of us the
[1:12:00] ark's not rolling through the Wilderness
[1:12:02] it's walking into
[1:12:03] Walmart I don't know why we use Walmart
[1:12:06] so much he's walking into
[1:12:11] Target Aldi praise the
[1:12:15] Lord that's where we
[1:12:18] shop it's
[1:12:20] anointed it's got good prices
[1:12:23] too we found out these creatures were
[1:12:25] not angels all right we'll see watch
[1:12:28] brother Brown now John John tells you
[1:12:29] where they're at he's got the see in
[1:12:31] Revelations real
[1:12:32] quick he brings that scene out in
[1:12:34] Revelations one sitting on the throne
[1:12:36] he's got the the four Beast around it
[1:12:38] he's got the 4 and 20 Elders sitting on
[1:12:40] little bitty Thrones around it all right
[1:12:43] then you see that those are that the the
[1:12:46] four they're cherubs then you see
[1:12:48] Angels around about all that remember
[1:12:52] the angel of the Lord is encamped about
[1:12:54] those see to me when you look at that
[1:12:56] when I look at that I see
[1:13:01] me I got a
[1:13:03] throne if I'm born
[1:13:06] again brother Samuel if you're born
[1:13:10] again you got a
[1:13:12] throne you are the throne and if you're
[1:13:15] born again there's one sitting on that
[1:13:17] Throne ain't the devil and it ain't
[1:13:21] you there's one sitting on the throne of
[1:13:23] your heart it's God yes then you got
[1:13:27] four beasts lonox man and Eagle you got
[1:13:29] some power to
[1:13:32] use then you got 12 Apostles in the Old
[1:13:36] Testament 12 in the new we quote them
[1:13:38] all the
[1:13:39] time right amen we they we use them all
[1:13:43] the time 12 Apostles 12
[1:13:46] Patriarchs they're there for the
[1:13:49] ministry to minister to me and you all
[1:13:52] right then you got Angels just like I
[1:13:54] said before you got Angels you got
[1:13:57] ministering Angels you got angels that
[1:13:59] protect me in
[1:14:01] you and some it takes more than others
[1:14:04] but that's all right there's not a
[1:14:05] shortage and God knew that you'd need
[1:14:07] one and I would need more than one but
[1:14:10] there's Angels right here now yes and if
[1:14:14] something's if something comes up
[1:14:16] they're there to take care of it and
[1:14:18] another
[1:14:20] dimension but listen we're the recipient
[1:14:22] of it in this Dimension right oh is not
[1:14:25] born you this is real this is what your
[1:14:28] Christian Life ought to be is about
[1:14:31] these four living creatures these four
[1:14:33] beasts these zoomes the living creatures
[1:14:35] have morphed over into beasts to combat
[1:14:39] the Beast that
[1:14:40] Satan's kicking
[1:14:43] out right here
[1:14:45] Revelations I saw when the lamb open one
[1:14:47] of the seals and I heard it was a noise
[1:14:49] of Thunder one of the four Beast saying
[1:14:50] come and see then what happened a white
[1:14:52] horse rider rides out right
[1:14:57] go to the next one the next Beast says
[1:15:00] come and see to the second seal what
[1:15:03] happens when he says come and see
[1:15:05] another Beast rides out rides
[1:15:09] out third one fourth one and then thank
[1:15:13] God for a prophet that he said on the
[1:15:16] fourth seal the Rapture takes place now
[1:15:17] you might understand that but you will
[1:15:18] later on but he said the reason is is
[1:15:21] cuz we don't see any in the fifth seal
[1:15:23] there's no combat Beast there there's
[1:15:25] nothing to combat right actually then
[1:15:28] what happens is you go to Revelations
[1:15:30] 11:13 and whatever 17 and you see that
[1:15:33] Beast listen that Beast is not in power
[1:15:36] when we're
[1:15:37] here now he's getting his power now but
[1:15:40] he's not going to come into full
[1:15:42] Authority and power till we're gone
[1:15:44] right so he listen there'll be nothing
[1:15:46] to
[1:15:47] combat those Blox man and Eagle they're
[1:15:49] going to be over another other dimension
[1:15:51] with us everybody with me all right
[1:15:55] they're going to send the Holy Ghost to
[1:15:56] to anoint not to anoint but to to anoint
[1:15:59] two prophets that get the Holy Ghost
[1:16:00] that give the Holy G that get the Holy
[1:16:02] Ghost and present it to 144,000 and they
[1:16:05] receive the Holy Ghost everybody with me
[1:16:08] okay so one of the four Beast has come
[1:16:11] and
[1:16:11] seat now brother talking about the three
[1:16:13] different categories look outer Court
[1:16:17] inner Court holy of
[1:16:20] holies everybody with me on this outer
[1:16:23] Court in court holy of holies where is
[1:16:28] God sitting in the holy of holies that
[1:16:31] Center section that's right everybody
[1:16:33] with me then the Holy Ghost is around
[1:16:36] that to protect it then you've got
[1:16:39] ministering Spirits or ministers that
[1:16:41] that Minister the gospel to you all
[1:16:43] right then you got that last ring is
[1:16:46] Angels cuz
[1:16:47] listen at least a third of them angels
[1:16:49] are bad the Bible says remember Satan
[1:16:53] preached them a sermon and they took his
[1:16:56] sermon besides the other sermon that
[1:16:58] that God was preaching I mean God knew
[1:17:00] that but they're there to do what
[1:17:02] they're there to run that guy in front
[1:17:03] of you they're there to run to have
[1:17:05] something fall how many of you had a
[1:17:07] miracle in your
[1:17:09] life okay if you hadn't just wait on
[1:17:11] just just wait just wait well when you
[1:17:14] had a miracle in your life that meant
[1:17:15] that there was an opposition here that
[1:17:17] was trying to do something to
[1:17:19] you that wasn't
[1:17:23] God but thank God there was something
[1:17:25] there yes sir to combat that yes to move
[1:17:29] that ladder out of the way to move this
[1:17:31] over here to move and even if you go
[1:17:33] through something you remember years and
[1:17:35] years ago when I when I drove that 3-in
[1:17:37] nail through my fingers they went all
[1:17:38] the way through both of them and stuck
[1:17:40] in that one and it was a 3-in nail from
[1:17:42] a nail gun
[1:17:44] po well you say well boy the the the
[1:17:47] angel didn't help you on that when he
[1:17:49] was a little
[1:17:50] behind no the greatest the greatest
[1:17:54] testimony was is when I went to the
[1:17:56] doctor for something
[1:17:57] else I had my finger wrapped up and he
[1:18:00] said what's wrong and I unwrapped it and
[1:18:02] I showed it to him I said I drove a 3 in
[1:18:05] nail through through directly through
[1:18:07] that finger in through that finger and
[1:18:09] into this finger 3 Ines worth it was
[1:18:11] sitting just like this and I just pulled
[1:18:12] it out he said oh said who fixed it for
[1:18:19] you I said well well I didn't tell him
[1:18:21] this but I should have told him yes I
[1:18:22] said well we have a physician and he's
[1:18:24] pretty great
[1:18:27] but I said I said I never even went to
[1:18:29] the emergency room he said let me see
[1:18:31] that and you can actually still see you
[1:18:34] know when you nail the nail Brother Gary
[1:18:35] knows there's an X where that where that
[1:18:37] point goes in there's an X in the wood
[1:18:40] well there was an x on my finger he
[1:18:41] looked at that and he said is that where
[1:18:42] it went in I said yeah right there he
[1:18:44] said you know he said he said just about
[1:18:46] a paper thin
[1:18:48] Edge if it would have been up above it
[1:18:51] would have cut this major tendon and
[1:18:53] said your finger would have fell and
[1:18:54] would have never would have been able to
[1:18:56] pick that finger up again he said if it
[1:18:58] had been about a paper thin Edge down
[1:19:00] this way he said it would have stuck and
[1:19:03] your finger would have been stuck
[1:19:04] straight out like this for the rest of
[1:19:06] your life you wouldn't have be able to
[1:19:07] bend it he said if I was a surgeon is
[1:19:10] what he said he said if I was a surgeon
[1:19:12] I couldn't have put that
[1:19:13] nail in a place where I didn't hit one
[1:19:15] of those nerves or
[1:19:17] tendons I said well I know one that
[1:19:21] did sometimes to he lets our stupidity
[1:19:24] take over for just a moment to do that
[1:19:27] to drive it through there and then for a
[1:19:29] doctor to say if I was doing surgery on
[1:19:32] that I couldn't fix
[1:19:34] it I said well doc I know one that did I
[1:19:38] said I never went to the doctor never
[1:19:39] went to the emergency room we put a
[1:19:41] little Epsom salt on it Epsom Salt's
[1:19:43] good for those of y'all don't know that
[1:19:45] epom salt's good for a lot of stuff but
[1:19:47] I you know what epom salt is okay
[1:19:51] learning curve here
[1:19:54] it's good for your
[1:19:56] plants it's good for your fingers it's
[1:19:59] good for your sore muscles and it's a
[1:20:01] good laxity if you'll take
[1:20:06] it but that to me see that to me that's
[1:20:09] the testimony that I can give that even
[1:20:12] though stupid me I shouldn't have been
[1:20:14] doing what I was doing I when I was
[1:20:16] bouncing and I had the trigger pull I
[1:20:18] was bouncing across a header well that
[1:20:19] bouncer that header was bouncing well I
[1:20:21] got to the end it just moved over just a
[1:20:23] little bit and instead of going through
[1:20:24] the before it went through my
[1:20:26] fingers but to go to the but to not have
[1:20:28] to go to a doctor and to go and have him
[1:20:31] testify that you you should have hit
[1:20:34] something cuz man that's pretty narrow
[1:20:36] and if y'all look at a 3-in nail a 3in
[1:20:38] nail is at least that that thick going
[1:20:42] through that there ain't a whole lot of
[1:20:45] room right there he said I could have
[1:20:47] surgically never took that thing out and
[1:20:49] not hit something I said well I know one
[1:20:52] that did so see I can
[1:20:55] that's been about 20 years ago when I
[1:20:57] was building my house and oh yeah it's
[1:21:00] got a little arthritis in it but so do
[1:21:03] everything else and I didn't put nails
[1:21:05] in
[1:21:09] that we laugh a little we cry a
[1:21:13] little but but you think of that things
[1:21:15] in your
[1:21:16] life that God's done for
[1:21:20] you you think about that it wasn't by
[1:21:23] chance I do not believe in
[1:21:26] luck I do not believe in luck at all I
[1:21:29] believe in being
[1:21:30] fortunate fortunate to have a God that
[1:21:33] take care of you and to be so strong
[1:21:36] well there sit one over there brother
[1:21:37] Danny we all got this testimony that
[1:21:40] just an inch or more and his head would
[1:21:43] have hit concrete right it wouldn't have
[1:21:45] been far that concrete block when he
[1:21:49] fell he said well the angel should have
[1:21:51] caught him well he's sitting here didn't
[1:21:54] kill him God needed him for something
[1:22:00] joce he needed him for something Joy
[1:22:04] okay joce needed him for
[1:22:07] something there you go that's
[1:22:10] right but we see these
[1:22:12] scenes but let's watch this one right
[1:22:14] here and then we'll close we won't even
[1:22:16] talk about the other Church age I like
[1:22:19] talking about testimonies in our in our
[1:22:21] life cuz our life our life is molded the
[1:22:24] thing things that we go through is
[1:22:25] molded it molds our
[1:22:28] character though God slay me yet I'll
[1:22:31] trust him though God break me up yet
[1:22:34] I'll trust him though God let something
[1:22:36] drive through my faith I trust him amen
[1:22:39] listen I trust him now more than I ever
[1:22:41] trusted
[1:22:42] him as you get older you will trust him
[1:22:45] a whole lot
[1:22:46] more right so Jewish tradition says that
[1:22:50] the four standards under which Israel
[1:22:51] encamped in the wilderness to the east
[1:22:53] was Judah
[1:22:56] where's Judah where did where did Jesus
[1:22:59] come
[1:23:02] from the tribe of Judah ain't he going
[1:23:05] to come from the
[1:23:06] East and he's the lion of the tribe of
[1:23:11] Judah this is not by coincidence folks
[1:23:15] this is
[1:23:16] perfect the East was Judah to the north
[1:23:20] was Dan to the West Was Ephraim and to
[1:23:22] the South was Ruben where respectively a
[1:23:25] lion and eagle and ox and a man they had
[1:23:27] a banner I'll show it to you real quick
[1:23:30] while in the midst was the tabernacle
[1:23:32] containing the shika symbol of the
[1:23:34] divine presence of God the talmood saw
[1:23:36] these four creatures the four primary
[1:23:38] forms of life in God's creation watch it
[1:23:41] also noted that the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:23:44] camped under these four
[1:23:46] banners you had 12 tribes you had three
[1:23:49] tribes on this side three on this side
[1:23:50] three on this side three on this side
[1:23:52] but they had a head Banner right that
[1:23:54] was inside right next to the Shak Glory
[1:23:58] so now watch Reuben symbolized a man
[1:24:01] Reuben was the oldest of the Patriarchs
[1:24:04] he was born first he was first born the
[1:24:07] man right then you got Dan which is the
[1:24:11] eagle many things about Dan that went on
[1:24:14] in their tribe we we we'll maybe we'll
[1:24:16] cover a little bit later but don't need
[1:24:17] to cover it now but he symbolizes the
[1:24:20] eagle Ephraim symbolizes the calf of the
[1:24:22] O and the rest with Judah which is
[1:24:25] obviously the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:24:27] well now this is going to I don't know
[1:24:29] if you can read see all that but that's
[1:24:32] the way they
[1:24:33] were
[1:24:35] around the ark there was the tabernacle
[1:24:38] the
[1:24:39] Levites the sons of
[1:24:42] Aaron then you had Judah from the
[1:24:46] east line of the tribe of Judah then you
[1:24:49] had the Dan you had the eagle what
[1:24:52] up then you had the ox to the
[1:24:55] west then you had Reuben which is the
[1:24:58] man at the bottom and that's the way God
[1:25:01] set it
[1:25:03] up in the
[1:25:07] wilderness
[1:25:09] okay where's God now he's tabernacling
[1:25:12] in
[1:25:14] man that's
[1:25:16] you he's tab this is
[1:25:19] you all right and what are the Levites
[1:25:21] to do the Levites are to what carry the
[1:25:23] word of God
[1:25:24] to the people that's right all right
[1:25:27] they came out of here and they
[1:25:29] ministered to the people is everybody
[1:25:31] with me all right then you had your
[1:25:33] people that lined up all the way around
[1:25:36] but you had the banner of Judah the
[1:25:38] banner of Ephraim the banner of ruin the
[1:25:40] banner of dead and they all were with
[1:25:44] those four beasts that Ezekiel Saw line
[1:25:48] ox man an eagle and that's the way they
[1:25:50] were positioned now as far as us as
[1:25:53] believers
[1:25:55] that's a
[1:25:56] symbol of us it doesn't mean that we
[1:25:59] have Gad and Ruben and Simeon we we have
[1:26:01] those four combat Beast that God thought
[1:26:04] enough to put every one of them had a
[1:26:05] banner sticking
[1:26:06] up and that Banner went
[1:26:09] first you had the lion Banner the ox man
[1:26:12] and Eagle those banners stayed there and
[1:26:14] they and you know you can have a whole
[1:26:17] sermon on how they uh when they when
[1:26:19] they got ready to move it wasn't just
[1:26:21] they just got up and took off
[1:26:24] read reading Leviticus they had to take
[1:26:26] the Tabernacle
[1:26:28] apart the Levites had to take the
[1:26:30] Tabernacle
[1:26:32] apart
[1:26:34] okay then you had all these and I don't
[1:26:36] know which one went first but there's
[1:26:37] there was an order and it would just
[1:26:39] line straight up to where they would be
[1:26:40] around that Ark and they would go
[1:26:42] through the
[1:26:44] Wilderness that's a symbol of what God's
[1:26:46] doing to you when you move those combat
[1:26:50] beasts move with you they're right there
[1:26:53] with you all the time
[1:26:55] to combat why were they why were why
[1:26:57] didn't they have like all 12 down here
[1:27:01] you left your back open you left your
[1:27:03] sides open military
[1:27:05] man that would have been horrible
[1:27:07] somebody could have come in and said oh
[1:27:08] we realize they don't have anybody on
[1:27:10] that top side we just going to come in
[1:27:11] from the bat Satan says oh I think I'm
[1:27:13] going to come in from the backat he
[1:27:15] ain't got oh there it is it popped up
[1:27:17] there cuz you got all sides covered am
[1:27:21] there's no way the enemy could get into
[1:27:23] that Tabernacle without somebody
[1:27:25] sounding a trumpet on one side of the
[1:27:27] other then they went to
[1:27:31] battle this is the
[1:27:33] battle so the temple guards all those
[1:27:36] Temple guards is the holy ghost in your
[1:27:38] life that guards you every day he said
[1:27:42] I'll never leave you nor I will forsake
[1:27:45] you I'll be there all
[1:27:48] time I'm the power that you need every
[1:27:51] day to survive through this age that
[1:27:55] we're
[1:27:56] in we thank God for that don't we we
[1:27:59] thank God that he did
[1:28:02] that so real quick before we close let's
[1:28:04] just go through this real quick the
[1:28:05] tharan ages we're coming up to it's the
[1:28:08] longest Church age it's from 66 to 1520
[1:28:11] about 900 years it is called the Dark
[1:28:14] Ages and also is called it has the O
[1:28:17] anointing because longest Church age
[1:28:19] it's actually the longest scripture
[1:28:21] describing the church age all right
[1:28:25] but the meaning of that is a dominating
[1:28:29] female or it also means continual
[1:28:33] sacrifice listen they didn't just all
[1:28:35] give and Josh gave me a thing I didn't
[1:28:37] bring it on my phone he looked up what
[1:28:39] 68 million people would be it would be
[1:28:42] the whole state of Los Angeles and the
[1:28:45] whole state of Texas
[1:28:48] right cforia California and Texas 68
[1:28:52] million people it would obliterated two
[1:28:55] states two of the biggest states in the
[1:28:56] United States also the UK has 68 million
[1:29:00] people in its in its country it would
[1:29:02] obliterated the whole
[1:29:03] country that's how much they killed
[1:29:06] that's how much The Killing was the
[1:29:08] natural killing during that church age
[1:29:11] was is worse than a war that's not a war
[1:29:14] I don't think you can probably combine
[1:29:15] every war that's ever been fought make
[1:29:17] it 68
[1:29:21] million listen folks under the
[1:29:25] ospice that they're
[1:29:28] right and we're killing these people
[1:29:31] because we're right and they shouldn't
[1:29:34] be on the earth cuz they're wrong and
[1:29:36] those 68 million were
[1:29:39] Christians but the Roman Catholic Church
[1:29:42] was killing
[1:29:44] them we think 6 million Jews in a few
[1:29:47] years by
[1:29:48] Hitler remember brother Bram said one
[1:29:50] time I believe he one time he said that
[1:29:52] Spirit never died it just went from
[1:29:54] there over to Hitler Hitler caught that
[1:29:58] same Spirit to get to get rid of a
[1:29:59] certain group of people cuz that's how
[1:30:02] Rome was get rid of a certain group of
[1:30:04] people and we'll have we'll have a
[1:30:05] perfect world Hitler was going to get
[1:30:08] rid of the Jews and have a a white white
[1:30:11] race that was going to be perfect that's
[1:30:13] what he was doing but he had to get rid
[1:30:16] of these
[1:30:17] people cuz they were a thorn in his side
[1:30:21] they had money they had power and he
[1:30:24] wanted to take it all the away from him
[1:30:26] so we see it's a dominating female the
[1:30:28] messenger was Columba see he lived from
[1:30:30] 521 to 597 so he died before the church
[1:30:33] age started and for those of you that
[1:30:35] didn't know it little George Quinn
[1:30:36] brother George Quinn he's from Donnie
[1:30:38] Gall Ireland that's right and and uh
[1:30:41] Columbus uh house is not there but the
[1:30:44] foundation stones are still there and
[1:30:46] you can go every and and visit it um I
[1:30:49] think Mom and Dad and them did it when
[1:30:51] they were over there but he was from
[1:30:53] Donal Ireland
[1:30:55] and it's a long very long you know why
[1:30:58] it's long because it's a long Church age
[1:31:00] but I want to get into one thing right
[1:31:01] here I want you to look at this
[1:31:04] city the city had rivers that they said
[1:31:08] it was just Rivers everywhere beautiful
[1:31:10] Rivers but they everyone had leeches in
[1:31:13] them you dive in you come out you got
[1:31:16] leeches all over
[1:31:19] you sin's pretty you
[1:31:22] know sin's pretty till you dive
[1:31:26] in then what do you get suckers
[1:31:29] leeches their worship was of Apollo the
[1:31:33] son God but now watch this is strange
[1:31:36] how this changes Apollo was the Su n God
[1:31:39] and you see how I put a little God I
[1:31:42] ain't putting no Capital God in there
[1:31:45] but worshiped Apollo the son God son of
[1:31:48] Zeus hello
[1:31:50] somebody but he spoke through supposedly
[1:31:53] through a propheus who sat on a
[1:31:56] three-leg stool thre leg
[1:32:00] stool and delivered a
[1:32:04] message on a three-leg chair now who in
[1:32:07] the world would make a three-leg chair
[1:32:09] only them to symbolize the trinitarian
[1:32:12] doctrine that she was setting
[1:32:15] on and you had to belong to the temple
[1:32:18] or you were
[1:32:20] persecuted you had to belong to this
[1:32:22] prophetess and you had to pay dues and
[1:32:24] all that stuff and you had to do what
[1:32:26] they did and I'm not going to say what
[1:32:27] they did cuz some of it's really awful
[1:32:29] but you had to do that to belong or what
[1:32:31] they would do was they would close your
[1:32:33] business
[1:32:34] down they would make it so bad on you
[1:32:37] till they'd make you
[1:32:38] join am I making sense here that devil
[1:32:42] never died it just moved right here and
[1:32:46] then listen it in here though watch in
[1:32:48] here and I I'll go back over this again
[1:32:51] so we'll get ready to close but remember
[1:32:53] the dominating female is a what a
[1:32:56] dominating
[1:32:58] Church everybody with me woman is a
[1:33:00] church dominating
[1:33:02] female it started in Ephesus remember we
[1:33:04] talked about Diana they worshiped
[1:33:07] Diana then in thara they had a propheus
[1:33:10] or another woman and in our age is the
[1:33:13] Apex because that dominating female came
[1:33:15] into what not only to the church but
[1:33:18] sorry sisters God bless you but brother
[1:33:20] Bown in th Church ages when he really
[1:33:22] cut to women and told told them they
[1:33:24] couldn't preach they couldn't wear
[1:33:26] clothes pertaining to a man and you
[1:33:29] ought to know that I'm I'm saying this
[1:33:30] you
[1:33:31] know and you can't preach and all these
[1:33:34] different things why because the
[1:33:35] dominating female that's of the
[1:33:37] devil he said that she had an iron
[1:33:41] disposition IR n and he said A True
[1:33:44] Believer should not a sister woman
[1:33:46] should never have a an iron in Iron
[1:33:50] disposition or a ruling disposition
[1:33:54] and if you'll keep reading in the church
[1:33:55] age book The reason we say well well now
[1:33:58] you ain't supposed to wear clothes
[1:33:59] pertaining to a man because the Bible
[1:34:01] say well you got to help me a little bit
[1:34:03] further on
[1:34:05] that well you ain't supposed to cut your
[1:34:07] hair you're going to have to help me a
[1:34:08] little bit on that I know what the Bible
[1:34:11] says but give me the meaning the
[1:34:13] underlying meaning brother M tells you
[1:34:16] it puts you in the place of a
[1:34:19] man God wanted them separated right man
[1:34:23] you cut your your hair you don't wear
[1:34:24] dresses well this age I don't
[1:34:27] know but over here if you wear your it
[1:34:31] makes a dominating appearance for a
[1:34:34] woman to wear something pertaining to a
[1:34:37] man that's the reason is those two
[1:34:39] Spirits not it Just brother Ram said
[1:34:41] listen we went through all them years
[1:34:43] that brother Ram told us this you know
[1:34:45] don't you got to tell me why I know the
[1:34:48] Bible says why but it's in the Old
[1:34:49] Testament you've ever heard that
[1:34:51] before but it's that dominating spirit
[1:34:54] that gets on
[1:34:56] you you lose your headship when you cut
[1:34:59] your hair sisters you lose your
[1:35:05] headship when you put on a pair of pants
[1:35:07] you lose you have asserted yourself in
[1:35:10] the place of the
[1:35:12] man by wearing something
[1:35:16] pertaining to a
[1:35:18] man see so that explains it to me more
[1:35:20] than any I had read the church AG book a
[1:35:22] 100 times and I read it just a little
[1:35:23] bit a while ago and brother Ram explains
[1:35:26] that he said it's not he said it's
[1:35:28] because of that dominating effect that a
[1:35:30] woman should never have over a
[1:35:34] man sorry what he
[1:35:37] said you should never dominate a man
[1:35:41] that's why you don't have women in in
[1:35:42] the pull pit same thing you you've
[1:35:44] asserted that spirit in the place of the
[1:35:46] holy spirit because the Holy Spirit
[1:35:48] don't don't said not to put women
[1:35:50] preachers back here because you've
[1:35:52] asserted yourself what a dominating
[1:35:54] female and that's exactly what happened
[1:35:56] in that fourth Church age it became a
[1:35:58] dominating Force who was it the Catholic
[1:36:01] Church became a force and but what did
[1:36:04] it do then it started changing the ideas
[1:36:07] of
[1:36:08] people put them into a mode where they
[1:36:10] believed in a father son Holy Ghost
[1:36:12] Doctrine where they where they believed
[1:36:14] in baptizing entitles where they
[1:36:16] believed in a a three good system where
[1:36:19] they believed in sprinkling not pouring
[1:36:21] all these things that wasn't of God
[1:36:23] right that was a dominating force of a
[1:36:27] church that wanted to take over and they
[1:36:29] did for 900 years they played Havoc with
[1:36:34] the True Church of
[1:36:35] God Hey listen sisters brother I'm I'm
[1:36:38] going tell you you read that the church
[1:36:39] age book he said a good woman's great
[1:36:41] what did Solomon
[1:36:43] say best thing to find if you got a good
[1:36:45] one he said but a bad ones watering the
[1:36:48] blood right better to do what better to
[1:36:52] live on a housetop than live in house
[1:36:53] with a brother and wife
[1:36:57] Bible Bible don't throw anything at me
[1:37:01] throw it at
[1:37:03] this and that was Solomon he had about a
[1:37:05] thousand of them so he ought to know
[1:37:06] what he's talking about let's stand to
[1:37:08] our feet but that dominating effect and
[1:37:10] we'll see that that dominating church is
[1:37:13] what killed 68 million Jews and listen I
[1:37:16] mean 68 million Christians and brother
[1:37:18] brandham will I'll read it I'll bring it
[1:37:20] next next Sunday he says and un told
[1:37:24] Millions
[1:37:27] spiritually that went into that false
[1:37:29] system didn't get killed but went into
[1:37:30] that false system and was made to do
[1:37:33] things that they wern't supposed to
[1:37:36] do God bless you be careful all of us be
[1:37:40] careful let's man be a man woman be a
[1:37:43] woman listen I know we don't have any
[1:37:44] problem here but look out
[1:37:46] there why are they doing that why are
[1:37:50] they saying it don't matter why are they
[1:37:51] saying you can be a woman one time and a
[1:37:52] man one time
[1:37:56] or you can use the same bathroom CU
[1:37:57] you're all the same well let me ask you
[1:37:59] one question I've never seen a man have
[1:38:01] a
[1:38:03] baby man's never had a child right so
[1:38:07] there's a difference then there a
[1:38:09] difference in a male and a
[1:38:10] female like that woman they got to head
[1:38:12] our human services and health agency she
[1:38:15] was a really ugly man now she's a real
[1:38:18] real ugly
[1:38:20] woman yeah it's
[1:38:22] online that filth if we put that that's
[1:38:25] our highest that's our highest Authority
[1:38:28] for your
[1:38:30] health it's somebody that's changed
[1:38:32] their
[1:38:34] organs so that she could he could be a
[1:38:36] he could be a she that's the and that's
[1:38:39] the mentality yes it is that's running
[1:38:42] the health department of this
[1:38:44] government God help us that dominating
[1:38:48] female effect is now taken over that's
[1:38:49] why even I believe brother R said
[1:38:51] there'd be a woman in the White House
[1:38:52] they would be a he saw a woman that
[1:38:54] would raise up right a powerful woman
[1:38:58] Catholic church or maybe we got a vice
[1:38:59] president right so let's stay in our
[1:39:03] lane we do but just be careful sisters
[1:39:06] don't try to dominate your husband
[1:39:08] that's a that's a bad spirit and it's
[1:39:10] and it's not good at
[1:39:12] all let's don't be a
[1:39:15] doormat don't make him a doormat
[1:39:18] man that's your sister in the Lord
[1:39:23] but the Bible says ever how you treat
[1:39:25] her is how God's going to treat you so
[1:39:27] you better be careful let's don't get
[1:39:29] out of our lane either all right but if
[1:39:32] we stay in our lane then it's a it's a
[1:39:33] beautiful picture of of the bride of
[1:39:35] Christ in the church the the bride being
[1:39:38] the church and then him being the the
[1:39:40] the us being the bride he be the groom
[1:39:43] let's leave it that way that's the way
[1:39:44] he wanted it and listen if God don't
[1:39:46] wanted it that way he can't change his
[1:39:48] mind that's right so why are we trying
[1:39:50] to change his mind I don't say we but
[1:39:52] the world's trying to change the
[1:39:53] literally change the mind of God can't
[1:39:56] do it ain't going to happen that's the
[1:39:57] way it's going to be let's sing a song
