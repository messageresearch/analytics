take it from something that might be in my mind Lord into a living reality Lord into something that's in our hearts Lord Jesus we just ask Lord that your spirit will come and Quicken these things that are said tonight for us Lord we ask in your name amen so Ruth chap 2 verse 1-9 says if if you've got your Bible or if you can read on the screen it says and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of IMC and his name was Boaz and Ruth the moabit said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her hat was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz who was of the Kindred of limc and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said under the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the Reapers whose damel is this and the servant that was set over the Reapers answered and said it is the moabi damel that came back when they owe me out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the Sheep so she came and continued even from the morning until now that she teared a little in the house then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to clean in another field glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charge the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art of thirst go under the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn you may be seated the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word I think I think this is uh uh this is an example of one of the greatest love scenes the greatest love stories that's ever been told and you know you look into the Bible and you you you see the whole Bible that speaks of of a love story between between Christ and his bride and it's echoed all throughout the scriptures with stories like this one and brother R said and why little Bethlehem and he said when Ruth and Boaz was married one of the greatest love scenes of all ages when Ruth and Boaz were married and you think about that scene unfolding when when Ruth when when Ruth was out there gleaning in the Harvest and she was out there with a purpose she wasn't just some some some Floy some some Jezebel looking woman but she was out there she was wanting the things of God she was wanting she was fulfilling the plan of God in her life and she Bo eyes looked out I looked out over the field and and and something began to stir with it within him he wanted to know who that was who who is this is out here in the field gleaning and and and going through all this this this this act of the love story you know Humanity I I think Humanity loves a great love story you know i' I've got a lot of daughters and they they love all these Cinderellas and Snow Whites and all that kind of stuff and anybody you know people love people love love stories you know you you he you read the stories of Pride and Prejudice and all that stuff you know that all those things but here's the here's really the greatest love story that's ever been told laid out before you you think about what love is love real I'm talking about real agape love agape love is when somebody like Boaz could come along and look out in the field and see somebody that ain't got no claim to nothing a moabit us that don't came from nothing and doesn't have nothing to her name and can love somebody like that and that's the kind of love that was expressed by God to us is when God looked down at your life and maybe you were in the mire of sin and the muck on the side of the road and God pulled you out and said I love you and God did something and began to work something in your life and you see what real agape love is is when when you look at something look at look at something that don't doesn't have any consequence and yet you can love it that's how much God loved the world that he come and died for that whosoever would believe on him would be be saved Despite All the Troubles despite all the heartache despite all the sin and the mess that Humanity got themselves into but yet God looked at us and said I love him and he came down and died for us oh you think about all the stories that brother Brown told about how that God so love that he cared about a little a possum and if you've ever seen an a possum we've we've got them come up in the driveway before and come in the backyard and they're all covered in ticks and looking off they say possums are clean but every possum I've seen smells terrible smells like like a homeless person from Atlanta they it smells horrible and and and and and you you get you you think about that God Lov so much that that pawsum come up that even brother brandham didn't think nothing about that God turned his attention to that pawsum and said go and pray for that little stinking a possum why cuz I love you think about Jesus it would tell a story about a lily if God can clothe a Lily that's out there in the field that nobody even knows is growing out there can take care of that Lily or take care of that spare how much more is God going to take care of you cuz God loves the unlovable he loves those that are Wayward he loves those that have gone astray cuz that's what a Love Is God loves those that nobody else cares about oh you think that God will love you enough to die for you and that's why we love him back because he loved us so much he loved us when we were unlovable and now we love him back we love a God that can come down and die for us you love him tonight you love him because you love him enough to die to yourself for him he loved you enough to die for you and you love you love him enough to die to yourself you see what that's what the gospel is the gospel is not the gospel was never intended to just be a head knowledge kind of thing where you just know a lot of information but the gospel is to bring you into a personal relationship with God because you love God you love the one that loved you I want to ask you tonight what did did you come here tonight to see did you come here tonight to see the preacher to come here tonight to see one another did you come here expecting to feel your place in the Pew or to do to fulfill an act like Paul called a dead work or did you come because you have a personal relationship with the god that saved you and you love him and you come you come expecting to receive something from that God that loves you you expect to receive some strength tonight something from the god that come to and send a message from Glory down to help you tonight what do you love about church are you in love with the ministry are you in love with Fellowship are you in love with study with a lot of information so you can tell everybody how much you know are you in love with a good feeling or with the anointing or do you love the person of Jesus Christ that's what I'm talking about tonight Christ is the main thing Christ is the one that you you to have a relationship with you think about so many times people want to have a Rel they want to get a good remark from the ministry they want to get a good remark from their fellow but Christ is the one that I want to please I want toe please God you know if God is pleased with our service with our worship tonight he'll come in and abide with us he'll come in and make his presence known if we'll make him happy tonight God's the one I I want to make happy God's the one I want to please now you think about that story that brother R told of that the aror the son of the armor Meat Packing Company how he come and he went down to the to the to the little ranch there and he looked out and he saw a girl that nobody else paid any mind to she she had uh you know she's working there in the kitchen washing dishes or whatever and and and and he that that was the one that he began to fall in love with why did he fall in love with her because he's he was looking at God see God don't look at the outside God don't look at the outside but this man began to look on the inside what's on the inside your character he began to look down on the inside of what kind of a character that little girl had and he said this this girl has got some virtue this girl is a virtuous little woman and he began to talk to her and began to recognize this this is the one that I want to marry y' you think you think young people tonight when you look at when you're going to search for a mate you the outside might look all kinds of pretty and nice and handsome and different kind of things their feet might smell good and their hair might be cut right but look down on the inside what do they do they love God do they are they capable of love do they love love is the thing look down on the inside like God God said about David he said he's a man after my own heart my the heart the heart is what God is after and that story that that little armor meat packing company that little that son of the armor armor meat packing uh owner he was interested in that girl because of her of her character and he he said I'm coming after you and when he came back a year later she was there waiting on him and she wasn't she wasn't just waiting she was she was waiting prepared she was she had got herself ready she had got herself clothed and she was ready for him to come riding around and she said I I I had she knew she had confidence in him because she loved him she knew that he loved her and she she loved him because of it Philippians 1 says and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere and W without offense till the day of Christ Colossians chapter 3: 19 says husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them because love love is the thing that conquers everything I'm talking about the love I'm talking about the kind of love tonight that would make Adam want to go out in the garden with Eve I'm talking about a love where he could see that Eve had done wrong but yet something I got to go out I I I want to I got to save her now God could have struck her down and killed her and started everything over again but he I I believe that Adam was like I want that one that's the one that come out of my side that's the one that's part of me that's the one that's bone of my bone the Flesh of My Flesh I don't want to start the thing over again that's the one I want because the love of God was in him now we know the attribute of God wasn't in him to to the the attribute couldn't be manifest in Adam to actually do the the saving like it could be in Jesus Christ but yet he tried he tried I wonder tonight can we say that we love like that when your when your spouse does something wrong you Real Love is when you when you're get in an argument with your spouse and you get upset with them but yet you love them you love the thing that cannot be you love it doesn't matter what somebody does to you it doesn't matter how they how they reproach you or what they say to you but you love them anyway you love your spouse because they're part of you you love one another you know you love the you love the church because you're part of the same body you love your fellow Believers because we're part of that same mysterious mystical body you love one another because you love God let your love more bound yet more and more Paul says see God don't want your head this is not an extra intellectual gospel where we come to church knowing all kinds of knowing how we should behave knowing what we're supposed to do but God wants your heart let me ask you this question tonight are you willing to give it are you willing to open up every door of your heart are you will to open up completely that he can have preeminence because he wants to be the your lord he wants to be your savior wants to be everything brother Adam said God don't care how much education you got he wants your heart he don't care how much you know he wants your heart he don't care what's up in here he wants your heart the only thing that Christ will be wrapped in and that's your heart not your Creed he wants your heart he's not going to be wrapped up in your Creed but he's going to be wrapped up in the manger of your heart if your whole heart is in love with him brother Bram said and you love him and are gentle and live with him daily you know you've passed from Death un life if it isn't and you're otherwise you're just impersonating a Christian oh you see unless God has your heart if God doesn't have your heart you'll never be able to understand this book because God requires your heart to be able to look into this book of love it's a book of love and you got to have God you got to love God to be able to understand it brother said the Bible is a supernal book it's written so that it's hid from the schools Theologian it's a book of love when the when the love of God comes into the heart then you fall in love with God then he reveals himself the Bible meaning the interpretation of the Bible is God himself interpreting his promises right but the Bible is written between the line amen oh come on now how how many of you have received an email from your spouse from your wife or received a little letter we don't we don't write letters by hand anymore do we it's all it's all text or whatever but you can still read between the line you can still read those read read the things that are written there on the page and say I I I'm I'm seeing something Beyond what's there in black and white I'm seeing something Beyond it you you know the the the word of God is just like that you you open up the pages of the Bible and it begins to come to life it when you read the book of Ruth and and you see the Love Story unfolding you read the book of The Song of Solomon you see the story of God expressing his love to that shulamite woman you see the story of God expressing his love and it's you begin to read the read between the lines because God it's God revealing himself to you it's the word of God the word of God is what moves a Believer but you think about Elijah when he was back in that cave and he heard he heard the wind moving outside and he heard the the earthquake moving and then he heard that saw heard that fire rolling by but then he heard the still Small Voice God's voice drawing that's what moves a Believer when God can see God when a Believer can see God the love of God God expressed that's what that's what caused Elijah to come forth out of that cave when he heard that's what would caus a sinner to come forth to come forth and be drawn to God is when they see the love of God expressed when they see something begin to move when they see something genuine and real be expressed we've all heard the story of the chicken in the barnyard but y'all remember the story of the duck in the barnyard y the duck down with the chickens well I know we heard the story of the the eagle in the barnyard I mean the eagle the eagle in the barnyard with all the chickens but what about the duck in the barnyard with all the chickens now brother R said that duck that duck was a duck that was born in the barnyard and he didn't know that he was a duck he thought he was a a chicken cuz he was surrounded by all the chickens and and and all the roosters and everything would be you know leading him over there to peck on the ground and he thought he was just a chicken but one day one day that duck got a smell of water and he began to realize that he needed to he wanted to go toward that water if you've ever seen a duck ducks are so messy on AR they because they love water you give them a little spot in the backyard and I go thrashing around and turn your whole backyard into a mud pit but that's because Ducks love water and why why they love water cuz it's being built within them they got to go to that water and you see you you you let a you let somebody hear the gospel and they something will begin to Quicken within them and they begin to realize that's the thing that I wanted all my life what is it what is it something love begins to spring up that if God can love you so much the unlovable and God could die for you and pay the price for you and be willing to change your heart and change your life and change your makeup and change your life trajectory it'll it'll change you brother ra said you see you put Christ the word in front of a real believer and they'll make a bee line for it just like that duck went straight to the water you put Christ the word in front of a real real believer and they're not they're not going to let nothing stand between them and that water the water of the word they won't let nothing nothing somebody can say no nobody's hypocritical life No harsh words you're not going to be able to keep nothing you'll never be able to keep keep a real True Believer away from the word of God from the promises of God cuz you love God oh you see what love will do love will make you persevere love will make you stand true love will make you go to the end love will make you run this race with with the goal in sight because you love God if you love God the way that the Bible's talking about nothing is going to keep you from that goal nothing is going to keep you from that finish line you put the you put Christ a genuine a genuine message of Christ out there it's going to call and it's going to draw oh you think about what Ruth was doing here Ruth wasn't forced she wasn't forced to lay at boaz's feet in the threshing floor but she did it because she loved him she wasn't forced to do it Boaz wasn't made to stand in the gate and remove his shoe he didn't have somebody tell you better do that you got to do it but he did it because it was love he loved Ruth he loved and it was love that was moving on the scene love was in action Boaz Boaz wasn't forced to marry a mo moabitas but he loved her he did it because he loved her he loved her listen you see Revelation is not something in your head Revelation this afternoon is not education Revelation is not just something intellectual Revelation is is re reading the Bible is not like taking a pel and popping a peel but Revelation is not coming under the whe and opinion of another someone explaining to me until I cannot refute what they were saying someone beat me down but you're in love with Christ and love is what fills the church love is what drives it love is what draws The Sinner to repentance love is what CS the unbeliever it's because you're in love with Christ Rebecca wasn't made to go out with eleazer it was her decision there in Genesis when it said and they said we will call the damel and inquired their mouth and they called Rebecca and said unto her wil that go with this man and she said I will go we were down there at that wedding that of my my niece recently and brother Matthew was was reading the scripture during the wedding wil thou go with this man he actually he actually read that as as the bride was coming up are you going to go cuz it's got to be the bride's decision not based on being forced not by being colled into it but because you love you see what the preaching of the Gospel is doing the preaching of the Gospel is to draw you to Christ by love to to drop from that head Dr down into your heart when you begin to something begins to stir within like brother Adam called it the pulsating down within your soul that you feel God God begin to move it's not the preacher speaking to you anymore but it's God speaking to you it's not the preacher's voice anymore but it's God's voice speaking to you no man can come unto me except the father drawing and no man can come except the father is the father is the one that's doing the pulling at your heart the father is the one that's doing the speaking at your heart you see education is somebody education is somebody telling you their story yeah you read the book of Ruth and you you read that you read that story and you you you can understand it with the intellectual understanding but Revelation is something more than that Revelation is something you live through Revelation is something that you have experienced yourself Revelation is something that you know why you you you go to a wedding and you see the the bride and the groom standing up there at the platform and nobody else really understands their story except for that couple up there why because they've lived it when that man is up there and he watches his bride come down the aisle and he he he he sees his that that girl that he's known for all these all these months or however long come walking toward him he's got all these stories accumulated back behind him and he's looking at her with an understanding that goes past some kind of an intellectual education understanding something that just somebody told him about how he was supposed to act but he's looking at her with Eyes Of Love Love is what we're talking about this afternoon and brother ra said the darkest hour then Jesus comes along in that message in 1955 he said he has hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and will reveal it to B babes such as we learn amen is that right he will reveal it to babes you don't have to be smart to understand the Bible what do you have to have you have to have a humble heart it don't take a lot of head learning I that's one thing I I I really want to impress this afternoon you you begin to you as you begin to study the seals and study these great deep Mysteries and it looks like something that's passed your educational ability your intellectual ability and you study and study and press your way through it and then finally God begins to drop down and reveal to you the Simplicity of what it is and it's the Simplicity of it the Simplicity of it it goes past the eyes of the wise and The Prudent past their Minds past all the minds of the denominations past their minds because God reveals himself in Simplicity you all you have to have is a humble heart the Bible is God's love story to his church that's hid from all the scholarships in the world it's only know by one scholarship and that's through neology if you ever had any of it you know what I I mean down on your knees you have to read between the lines to make it right he said in Jehovah JRA he said now reading the Bible it's a love story that God wrote to his church it's God God is love Do you believe that and the Bible is written so that the educated and smart can never understand it you have to be in love with God to understand it you have to have God in you he interprets himself to you now it's just like I got a wife oh how I love her I love her with all my heart and I'll be overseas somewhere and she'll after she gets the kitties to sleep she'll write me a letter and say dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight I'm thinking of you I'm writing see I know what she's writing on the paper but I know her and love her so much till I just know her nature I know what she means so I can read between the lines how when you know somebody when you the know know the nature of God when you know what he's about and what he wants done with the word then you can read the Bible in the way that it's supposed to be read and God wants his church to read between the lines not read anything out of it now you have to read between the lines to see what it's meaning when you read between the lines the story of Ruth deciding and Ruth gleaning and Ruth resting takes on something different because it it because now you you have experienced it it's something that you've lived and you've gone through it when you look at David's life it's something that you've gone through laying there in your bed tossing around crying at night asking God to come on the scene for you that you need some help you've lived through that you've lived through those nights when you didn't know how to pray and what to say you've lived through it you've lived through Abraham on his journey you've lived through that and it's something Beyond just head knowledge something Beyond just knowing about something I'm talking to you tonight about a love between you and God a love where whether it's a shallow sermon or a deep sermon or deep teaching or a little lightweight message you love it because you love God you're in love with God and you want him you read the Bible and and you begin to understand what those three stages of your experience are because you can see it unfold you can see it unfold in the seals you can see it unfold in the sixfold purpose of Daniel 70 weeks you can see it unfold in every line every precept in the Bible because it's not something that you understand with your head anymore but it's love a relationship with you and God when you have become to enter into communion with him you've come from Faith to communion Faith to enter into the holy of holies and dwell with him the word is in layers it's in layers that you go from this to this to this so you got to read it like a love letter the whole Bible is a book of love all these love stories in the Bible of how Adam loved Eve so much that he'd go out with her how Isaac loved Rebecca and Rebecca loved Isaac even though she had never seen him before all she had to go on was that elasia was telling about and she wrote on those camels back but she when she got off that Camel she knew and when she saw him because she loved him she had fallen in love by what she had heard about what she had read about in the Bible Jacob and re Rachel that loved one another and Boaz and Ruth and Esther and The King The King that loved Esther so much that he lowered his scepter and said whatever you own I give it to you even to the half of the kingdom and Solomon and the shunamite that loved that woman that loved her so much and Christ in his bride you know many times we're we're scared to talk about love we're we're scared we think love is a scary thing we we don't want to really really want to talk talk about love too much we think well love is for sissies the world thinks real men love cars and guns and country music and loose living and we think that's what love is so we don't want to we think we got to be tough and and walk with our palms back and hateful around we think we got to be throw our shoulders back and be all hateful and stuff you got to be crusty but love brother ra said that love is the greatest weapon love is the greatest weapon that God ever put in the hands of man love is such a strong weapon that you can bring bring it into a home and it'll bring peace there love is such a powerful weapon that it'll cast The Devil out love is the kind of a weapon that'll clean up a life love is the kind oh you think about something so strong that you can cast a devil out with it that's the kind of of a weapon that God has given to the church with love if you love somebody love somebody that's yelling at you and screaming at you and pointing their finger at you you show them a little love and it'll change the situation it'll change everything I'm not talking about some little lightweight thing tonight some kind of sissified thing that's what the world has made it but I'm talking about something that God has given into our hands brother said love is the greatest most powerful weapon that this world has ever seen or know known of Love is the greatest force that we have the most powerful force love will just do things that nothing else will do nothing else when nothing else will work love will work when nothing else will do the trick love will do it when nothing else would call that Wayward love went back love will do it you show somebody a little love and it'll change everything it was love that made a man spread his arms on the cross that love is still able to take a cold Stony heart and soften it up love is what draws us to Christ love is how a Christian lives Jesus said in John 12 if I be lifted up from the earth I'll draw all men unto me and what is it doing the draw it's his love for you tonight that's what I'm here to declare to you tonight that God loves you no matter where you are no matter what your condition is God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to draw you unto him he's drawing the night he's pulling oh listen tonight I'm not looking at faces I'm looking past that I'm looking down to your heart that God is drawing it don't matter what the outside looks at God is drawing he's still able to draw and pull by his love it don't matter how little you love him or how little you care for him God cares for you he cares about you tonight the Bible says in James 4:8 draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you if you'll come to God he'll come to you and Jeremiah 31 said I love you with an everlas in Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee in Psalm 65 it says blessed is the man whom thou choosest and caus us to approach under thee how does he cause you to approach to God by his love is drawing you pulling you to recognize what God has done listen tonight love has drawing power love has got the kind of power that can draw a sinner to it and change their heart and change their life it's the kind of power that can make Ruth make a decision it's the kind of power that can make you make a decision tonight it's the kind of power that can make you arise from your Slumber and realize what God has done for you and verse 16 when Ruth said entreat me not to leave the telling to naomy why would she make a statement like that and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou dest will I die and there will I be buried Lord do so to me and more also if all but death part thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking into her Ruth made up her mind what was she do Ruth is a type Ruth is a type of us looking back at these Old Testament scriptures that the Jews had written down looking back at at that and oh you think about you think about Paul who had been raised up under under Gia and he knew all about those Old Testament teachings but then he began to understand the love of God you think about it when we when we read the story of Leviticus and read these stories that are written in the Old Testament that the Jews came to us it begins to change our mind and change what does it do it causes us to realize how much God loves us when you realize how much God loves you it'll it'll cause you to make up your mind to make up your mind in Ruth 1: 16 and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go she made up her mind she was standing firm on what she believed to be true why because what made her do that it was her love her love for Naomi her love for the what the god of Israel she was looking at what Naomi believed and she said I'm going to I'm going to go after that I made up my mind that I'm not going back to this moabi this way to live but I'm turning my I'm turning the corner I'm going that way I'm standing I'm standing on what you believe and you know the Bible says everything you've got to do you start your journey in faith you start your journey making up your mind not just on some whim but on what you know to be true and Ruth Ruth in her she started her journey in faith and that's how James says ask in faith ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and cost everything you do in life is because you made up your mind to believe God Mark 11:23 says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say into this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith why cuz it started out when you making up your mind I'm believing in God I'm believing that this mountain needs to be moved out of his place I'm believing and I'm speaking because of of my love for God I know that he loves me I know that I believe his word you what could we do tonight church if our minds were made up that our minds were made up that we weren't going to dilly dally with this gospel anymore that our minds were made up that we were going to get our lives straightened up that our minds were made up that we were going to give give our whole our whole body Soul and Spirit to God her mind was made up because she was convinced to the god of Israel right every believer's Journey Begins with faith in God what was she doing she was deciding she made a decision that I want his Banner Over me who the god of Israel I want the god of Israel's Banner Over Me I want to be under his protection I want to be in fellowship with him he's the one that I want if you want if you make up your mind tonight that I'm going to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because there's a promise laying in here that I can read in Exodus and in Ezekiel 36 and and Jeremiah I can read all these things In Those Old Testament scriptures that Naomi is speaking of I can read those things I believe that God laid that promise out for me if you could become convinced that it's there waiting for you she was deciding that I'll never have rest until I have him who the god of Israel she wanted she wanted the god of Israel that's why she made up her mind that she was going after God are you convinced are you convinced this afternoon that Christ loves you are you convinced that God is calling you he's still making the wedding call you know he sent he sent those men the story that Jesus told about how he sent them out into the hedges and the byways and the going out to to make that wedding call that the come all things are ready and I want to declare you tonight that there's still room at the wedding Feast God is still drawing the sinner's heart there's still some seats available there's still room at the wedding supper and Jesus said in Matthew 11 come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest in Revelation 19 it says blessed are they which are called under the marriage supppper of the Lamb a wedding a marriage is based on love and you can't go to this wedding without love when brother R went across the curtain of time they said you can't come here without perfect love you got to have love to go there you got to have AG love the kind of love that can love the unlovable the kind of love that can love somebody that looks like the whole church has abandoned it looks like the whole religious realm has given up on you got to have that kind of a love you got to have a love that when your spouse yells at you and screams at you you love them back you got to have love that when people in church say things that you don't you don't think need to be said you still love them because there's a gape love and we're all part of one body you love love is what I'm talking about and gleaning is what gleaning to Ruth became a labor of love and Ruth chapter 2 Naomi had a Kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of a limac and and his name was Boaz and Ruth the moabit said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose side I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her hat was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz who was of the Kindred of IMC and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the Reapers whose damsel is this and we know the rest of the story he told he told her you don't you stay put you just keep reap reaping in this field don't go anywhere else you ain't got to go to no denomination to find out what the true message of the hour is you don't need to go to any other Oddball message churches that are that are teaching that you got to follow a man or all these different kind of things follow their they all you just stay right here in this field stay put in this field and that became a labor of Ruth was happy to labor right she didn't mind she didn't mind to be seen in BO eyes' field she didn't mind for somebody to see the way that she dressed and the way that she acted in the church that she went to she didn't mind because it was love she was doing it because of love she was steadfast she had a goal in mind she was there with a purpose oh once you once you get started on your journey it's time to get to climbing time to get to gleaning time to get to work and you don't mind working in the field you don't mind gleaning a little bit you don't mind coming piece by piece here a little there a little you don't mind going home and and crying like I know some of y'all have done when Daniel 70 weeks is preached and hard hard messages are preached because you don't understand it it comes a little bit over here and a little bit over there and piece by piece you don't mind because it's a labor love you won't just throw in the towel and quit and go somewhere else because you don't understand it all at once but it's a labor of love brother said in the message job he said Boaz was represent ative of Christ for he was the lord of the Harvest he was over all the Harvest and notice as soon as he looked out in the field and saw that Gentile girl he fell in love with her why she was gleaning behind the Reapers that's what the church has to do pick up a little bit here and a little bit there GL that's what that'll make Christ fall in love with you too when he sees you oh God I need I want to understand this that'll make God realize there's something special about you reading over there and seeing what Jo done and what the rest of them done and how the way of redemption was laid picking up these little gleanings behind the Jewish Church see what I mean that grain that they were reaping represented life Immortal life eternal life to us out of the word the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God oh you realize what that means is that if you don't mind gleaning you don't you don't mind you don't mind maybe sometimes a little starchy service you get don't mind them heavy teaching because you love God you're there to get something you're there to get something from God and you love the word you love it as much as Ruth did when she was out there laboring in that field all hunched over maybe her back was hurting hunched over in that field working because she every little bit of handful that she could grab meant something to her this is something that's going to help me this is something that's going to feed me this means something to me oh does it mean something to you tonight do you love the sheaves big or small teaching or Evangelistic it don't matter or when evangelist comes through we love that but when teaching comes through it we'd rather have a different kind of shees but it's all the word Paul said I plant in Apollo's Waters but it's all the word you got to have the planting and you got to have the water and you need it all but you love it because you're in love with Christ you love it because you're not in love with the minister you're not in love with one another but you're love with Christ you love it because you if you were meant for the lord of the Harvest you love the Harvest if you were meant like Ruth for Boaz then you love the gr the grain you love the wheat you love it because you love what he loves oh it's you love to gather you love to work you love to labor because why you've got to have that wedding ring the wedding ring is the goal you've got to have that ring Above All Else you've got to have that token nothing else matters to you but that token you've got to have that full Redemption nothing else matters to you but full Redemption nothing else matters to you but that body change nothing else matters to you but the Holy Ghost Nothing Else Matters to a real believer because you're in love with Christ oh I I I pray that tonight that something will stir up within your heart maybe when you go home tonight when you get back on that road you you'll think I got to get along with God I got to get along back in that Holy Place why because you love God if if if you're if that love has grown cold if it's waxed cold and you oh tonight is the night to Stir It Up again tonight is the night when you go home get down beside your bed and say God rekindle something in me I want the fire of God that that love that I once had for you I want it to grow I want it to be rekindled in me in me oh you got to you got to work you got to labor in that field because what we're climbing to that token climbing to the proof what is the token that proof that you will not go through the tribulation why cuz you got that wedding ring on your hand it's a proof that you ain't going through the tribulation you got the ring on your finger and that's what Ruth was laboring for and the token brother R said the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all sin and there is no more purifying and the blood of Jesus Christ in that token as identification that has been purified amen that's the token of the Bride wearing the ring why are you laboring why are you laboring tonight why did you come to church why why are you a Christian is because you love him because you love him how do I get closer to God tonight how do I get closer you read The Love Letter how do I get closer to God throw open every door to your heart that's right every door that's what brother ra all those sermons that he preached the door to the heart the door to the heart the door of the door doors and door the door inside the door all those doors that we keep shut if we just open them up to him and let him come in why how you going to open it up outside of love is because you love Christ not because somebody told you to not because you read it with an intellectual idea and say Well it I should do it but because you love Christ if you lack love then the real Christianity cannot be expressed it's by love not by head knowledge love is more than just a fundamental understanding love is when the door is open and Jesus said in Revelation chapter 3 he said it was Christ that said these words he said behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come to him and will s with him and he with me it's Christ that's doing the knocking it's Christ that's doing the drawing Christ you think about this tonight now Christ God wants to Su with you he wants to sit down with you and have a personal relationship with you over what you're reading in this word he wants to fellowship with you oh we've been studying on melkisedek and all these old all these things that we can read in the Old Testament but what was mekis come he come serving communion Abraham God wants to sit down with you and have communion with you communion over over his his his word and over his Spirit he wants to have a relationship with you so just love God just love God tonight brother R said just love him with all your heart and forget all you ever know about all other things but Jesus Christ just go ahead and love him and work for him serve him now you think about what love does love does not care about your feelings or your emotions or how you are treated cuz he said if he wants you to be the doormat you just be the doormat if God wants you to be the doormat and you really love God you're willing to be the doormat you're willing to let everybody in church line up and walk all over you if you love God the right way that's agape love it's whatever he wants you to do you do it and I always remember this friends the Way Up Is Down he that exalts himself shall be abased but he that humbled himself shall be exalted oh I here's a good one that first in 1 Corinthians Paul said in chapter 8 he said If any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know if you think you know in your mind a lot of things you don't know the way that you ought to know yet but if any man love God the same is known of him if you love God from your heart then that's going to be on display on display and everybody's going to see that you love God if any man love God the same is known of him if you love him oh you think about love do my do do you mean when you talk about love do you mean when you're talking about Ruth there gleaning those sheaves do you mean that I got to humble myself that I got to bow down and pick up sheaves that I got to display character that I got to display a humble life love will do it and Colossians chapter 3 he said put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies there's love right there kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another you can't forgive if you don't have love you can't forbear if you don't have love If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye now I don't have this in my notes but if you want to study out what forgiveness is you cannot have faith without forgiveness because Christ said you forgive and then you'll be forgiven so you can't come you can't even come to Christ unless you first forgive that's in the Lord's Prayer he said oh you run down through the Lord's Prayer and he says forgive those who do who do things wrong to you so that you the the things that you've done wrong against God will be forgiven you see what what's that doing it's expressing love because love love is the greatest Force there is the greatest weapon and without love you cannot forgive you cannot forbear you cannot have patience with one another you can't do those things without love love is the that's why it's up there at the top I'm talking you're going to have perfect love when you're born you're going to have that perfect love in your soul when you're born again but love at the top is when it's expressed in completeness in perfectness where you begin to deal with with one another in a way that's different than you could when you were just born again why because you're you're you're able to put yourself in their their shoes you're able to empathize with that other person you're able to feel for that lost soul and a way that's different than when you were just born again love is what wins the day love is what'll speak squirrels into existence love is what will move a mountain love is what will change everything so stay put is what Boaz told Ruth here she was gleaning behind picking up these little gleans and the lord of the Harvest fell in love with her her being an alien what a picture my I just love that and then he said who damsel is this and they began to speak and said it's the moabit that come in with Naomi and they went out to her and spoke to her and said don't you leave this field God be merciful stay put don't be tossed about with every wind of Doctrine stay in the word you're going to stay there if you love God why because the Lord lord of the Harvest Boaz is worth all the labors Boaz fell in love with her and Ruth fell in love with him she began to realize like we he's worth he's worth everything Christ is worth everything he's worth taking up the cross he's worth all the struggles he's worth all the gossip and stuff you have to endure he's worth all the trouble that the devil can raise up and stir up he's worth enduring everything every fiery Dart of the wicked one that the devil can throw at you Christ is worth it all Boaz was worth it all to Ruth Christ is worth it all to a Believer he's worth enduring all the hardships love is what takes you to the Finish Line love is what takes you to the Token he let her glean in the field because he loved her and she was willing to work until the matter was settled because she loved him it was love when you love God it don't matter if they laugh at you like they laughed at David that's right you see that's another thing that happens when you start reading between the lines you start reading these stories different y it don't matter if everybody in the church puts you down right it don't matter if they say I you you were the last person I would have picked for that job yeah it don't matter if they mock you like the woman that washed Jesus's feet it don't matter if they call you a secret sinner when you've done nothing wrong like job oh come on now we can read these stories differently when you've experienced something when you've lived it then it becomes something more when it it becomes greater love is there for the Long Haul oh you think about so many that have come come in and went out and come in but but you didn't did you you stayed there you stay why' you do it because you love God why are you here tonight not because you love you love the building but because you love God love overlooks false all love overlooked all the they said he didn't have no beauty that anybody would desire him but love overlooks all that oh when when he said those harsh words to Peter and and and begin to say except you eat my flesh and drink my blood they looked past all the things they couldn't understand because they loved him love doesn't hold grudges love doesn't have a ledger book oh if we could just get rid of our Ledger books tonight all tonight I wish if you we every one of us could lay our Ledger books on the Altar and just leave them here at church if we could have that kind of a love for one another while we're not keeping a record of the Deeds we do to one another leave that ledger book and just burn it on the altar burn it with all your sins burn it with that throw it in that sea if forgetable I don't want I don't want ever look at that ledger book again that's what love will do you can look at somebody different without looking through your Ledger book first that's love love looks to the end Jesus said oh let's not forget the Forgotten beatitude blessed is he who is not offended in me me blessed is he who is not offended in the bumps along the way Amen in Matthew 11 when Jesus was when tell tell them what to tell to John he said the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended and me oh you see if the blind are receiving their sight and the lame are walking what does it matter if there's a little offence or a little bump on the road if if somebody's getting delivered of cancer I don't care about the little petty things why because we hear to love Christ oh if you see God coming down in the power and glory and manifest his manifest his de in the church it don't matter all the stuff that the devil does oh as long as the preacher Don't Preach on me you might say oh as long as I don't know the preacher's past life oh that's another thing sometimes we don't want to we don't want to hear a preacher that that's got a pass yeah I I'm so sick of that that's right I'm so sick of people it seems like everywhere I turn there's somebody saying well I I I I was with that preacher when he was smoking pot out in the world I was with that preacher when he wasn't living right so now I don't want to have nothing to do with it listen God can take somebody's life and change them if God if God can change somebody's life I'd rather be around a change [Applause] life oh we got all this list of stuff that we don't want to put up with but I I want to say tonight I'm willing to put up with all a awful lot if I can see Christ manifesting in my members I'm willing to put up with an awful lot if I can get to the end of the journey oh as long as I don't have to put up with personalities you might say but you're never going to get away from personalities as long as you come to church I got a personality that I'm expressing when I'm preaching every Minister here has got a personality that they're expressing when they preach and when you go out in the parking lot you're going to have personality you're never going to get away with from it but but that God has given a power and ability in the church to put for us to put up with one another the love of Christ manifest in our members if the blind receive their sight in the lame walk there ain't nothing worth being offended over it's if God is here if God is here in reality and I believe he is I believe I believe I can feel him right now I believe I know that he's here in this building right now he's still drawing and he's still calling and he's still willing to change lives and everything is worth it for him oh Peter took you think about all the ones in the Bible that took things took things that I wonder tonight if we could take if we could take if we were living back there Peter took it when Jesus looked at him in the face and said get thee behind him Satan I wonder if we could take it if somebody was to call us the devil could you take that if somebody called you the devil Peter took it when Jesus told him what's that to thee what do you care if John lives until until I come again what do you care all that would seem like a harsh thing for Jesus to say what is that to thee but Peter took it why cuz he knew he was in love with Christ he he was looking past the flesh DED that there was deity back there behind that flesh deity was tabernacled in that man and he wanted what he had oh the Greek woman had to endure something when Jesus came and told her she was a dog the Greek woman had to endure it I wonder tonight if we're willing to endure if somebody would were were to say something harsh like that to us oh let me say something to you tonight Church nobody got anywhere and anything natural or spiritual without persevering oh the our problem is our problem sometimes is we don't see the value of what we're doing here we don't see the value that that we're sitting in this church because it goes beyond just the pews and the the the wooden Pulpit that we're looking at here but we're we're here after eternal life eternal life is what we're after I want to make a challenge to you tonight do you love God do you love God to a point where it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what somebody says it doesn't matter if they don't shake my hand if it doesn't matter if they don't go out to eat with me it doesn't matter because I want Christ I'm willing to lay down everything on the altar I'm willing to come up to the Altar and be made a laughing stock like like all so many examples in the Bible because God loves me and I love him if God loves you he's going to try you he's going to chasen you he's going to scourage you he's going to give you a little challenge to see see how much you love him oh oh how many examples do we have of people that that oh they come around for a little while and as soon as some little some little something said wrong a preacher just don't say it quite right qu quite the way that they feel like it should be said and they out the door they go could we could we tie that back to they're really not interested in what the Seven Seals are they're really not interested in the revelation of Jesus Christ what they really are interested in is a club they're really interested in a place where where they can come to get some hot coffee in the basement but what they're really interested in is not Christ I'm talking about falling in love with Christ tonight and sure we're supposed to display the love of Christ because the love is what draws you but if you're really in love with Christ tonight it don't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if Cain takes a stone in his hand it doesn't matter if she begins to curse you like he did David it doesn't matter if they begin to throw stones and smite you in the face like they did Jesus and so many others in the Bible it don't matter because you're in love with Christ Hebrews chap 12 12 says for whom the Lord loveth whom the Lord loves he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers every one of us are partakers amen oh see sometimes we think well that Minister up there behind the pulpit hadn't endured it like I have but you don't know the life I live you don't know the life these other brothers live you don't know where we've come from we've all we all have to endure chastisement all our partakers and if you can't endure it then are ye bastards and not Sons on cuz a bastard don't know where he come from and he doesn't love his father because he don't where's who's his father a bastor doesn't know his father amen here in is now set forth the love of God brother BR said in the Le out of I see in church a he desired and love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be are you able to endure the chastening tonight you know if you can look past the chastening sometimes and realize that it's coming from love if you can look past the hard preaching sometimes and realize it's coming from love the reason sometimes we fail to see the love is because we don't know what love is Love sometimes has to chasen Love sometimes has to speak harshly love will speak harshly to get that kid out of the road or get them to the altar sometimes love has to strike hard but remember the end remember the end that Ruth was looking to she wanted that wedding ring Christ is all that matters that's why in Hebrews chap 13 it says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation well I don't like that brother that much but what's the end of their conversation the end of their conversation is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ is still the same that's the end the end of the conversation is Christ and that's what we're trying to get you tonight to tonight in First Corinthians Paul said know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so run that you may obtain run it to win the race I was watching my brother the other other day he was in an ultra marathon I think a marathon is 26 miles and he ran 48 miles up to the top of Mount Mitchel in North Carolina and all up to several mountains I don't know how he did it but you can see on the uh on the on the on the roster there you can watch it online of who was dropping out and where everybody was and where they were lagging behind and and and you watch them come through the finish line and I see you don't get a prize if you don't end the race you don't get a prize if you glean a little while in the field and then you give up you don't get the prize you you it's crossing the Finish Line when you get the prize see we're not we're not in a race to see how how how how much we can boast about our feelings being hurt but we're here to to get to cross that Finish Line oh you see now I I I kind of laugh you know how many of us could run 48 miles but my my brother was was dead last he was the last one and it took him from 3:00 a.m. in the morning until I think about uh 10:00 at night to finish that race but he finished he finished now now I'm not saying I I'm bragging on him a little bit but that's not my point I'm not saying this to brag on my brother I'm saying it to make a point you might feel like you're dead last in the race but just cross the line don't give up don't give up cuz we want you we want you to be so in love that's that's my goal to get you to fall so much in love not with me not with the church but with Christ to fall so much in love with Christ that you're willing to endure whatever if you love The gleanings the L lord of the Harvest loves you and if you love love the lord of the Harvest you're going to love the gleanings so Boaz said don't don't go out to any other field but stay with that word stay with Christ he's wooing you amen even in Hebrews chapter 4 it says let us labor there to enter into that rest let us labor stay in that field that to get to that Holy Ghost rest in Ru chapter 3 as we keep reading on and we're we're we're closing in on on the finish line here tonight when Boaz had eaten drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I'm Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou follow us not young men whether poor or Rich there was a lot of distractions maybe a lot of things that had caught her eye but she stayed right with Christ right with Boaz now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my peop just know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than I te this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee then I will do the part of a Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth thank you Lord and he said lie down until the morning amen lie down why cuz now she' been laboring all this time but she laid down at his feet and he put his skirt over her just like Christ covered you over took care of all your problems with the Holy Ghost he covered you with the Holy Ghost and when Christ covers you with the Holy Ghost it's time for you to stop doing your work and for him to go to work now Christ when C when Boaz got up and he he started after all that time of Ruth laboring now Boaz went to work I believe Boaz now the bride is resed in Christ is at work Christ is at work when Boaz was at work Ruth didn't have to be and when Jesus is at work you don't have to be you don't have to be manufacturing you don't have to be putting on Jesus said have faith in God because he's the one that's doing it he's the one that's working he's the one that's interpreting he's the one one that's proven tonight he's the one that's that's doing it he's the one that's working out his will he's the one that's interpreting his word Boaz was a type of Christ and Christ is here working in the church because he's the same yesterday today and forever so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went unto her the lord gave her conception and she bear him a son all this story is about love amen the love of God the love of the god God of Israel LED Ruth to make her decision Love Led her to lay at his feet love for Ruth LED Boaz to Redeemer so let's lay aside whether people love me or let's lay aside whether the preacher loves me that's right
