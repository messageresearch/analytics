[8:20] little patience
[8:23] temperance first and then patience just
[8:26] remember all these announcements and
[8:28] look downstairs and
[8:29] and thank these brothers you know when
[8:31] you go by and see that beautiful thing
[8:33] that they've got down there that
[8:35] uh announcement board that we don't have
[8:37] to write on there anymore that it's just
[8:39] constantly
[8:41] moving and and showing you what's going
[8:43] on in the church so
[8:45] we thank the lord for the brothers to do
[8:46] that i
[8:47] um i was talking to a guy yesterday we
[8:50] were
[8:50] um
[8:52] i'm taking a beekeeping course uh
[8:53] commercial beekeeping course from a man
[8:55] and
[8:56] he had a student there with him and
[8:58] and the guy was telling us how he
[9:00] couldn't get this done on the internet
[9:01] and he couldn't get that done and he was
[9:03] gonna have to do this and he's gonna
[9:04] have to pay for this gonna have to pay
[9:05] for that i just in my heart i said well
[9:08] thank god we got a group of guys
[9:11] god brought them here
[9:13] to do what needs to be done amen because
[9:15] we sure if we would have had to sub out
[9:17] a lot of this
[9:18] it'd be very very expensive
[9:20] so you you thank these brothers you know
[9:22] what a lot of times when we're at home
[9:24] sitting reading you know
[9:26] times magazine
[9:28] joe or some of them luis or some of them
[9:30] are back there trying to put something
[9:31] together like that downstairs for the
[9:33] church because it just doesn't create
[9:34] itself it has to be created by somebody
[9:37] and then put in to whatever like even
[9:40] this what goes into this is a is a is a
[9:43] monumental accomplishment that a lot of
[9:45] churches don't get and if they do get it
[9:47] they have to pay a lot for it so we
[9:49] thank god that he's put
[9:51] he's put these uh able-bodied brothers
[9:53] that can amen that can use their talent
[9:57] not only in their job but in the service
[9:58] of the lord so we thank them for that
[10:01] always but
[10:02] remember all the ones that are sick good
[10:03] to see brother gary back with us

[10:09] have strong faith
[10:10] that's what we're talking about you
[10:11] gotta have that strong faith that virtue
[10:13] faith where where you can uh draw
[10:15] strength from each other
[10:16] and not be divided draw strength from
[10:18] each other
[10:19] and um
[10:21] and i believe there's a lot of strength
[10:22] in here to be drawn from sometimes we
[10:24] just don't plug it in the right
[10:25] generator
[10:26] you know but we got to plug it in the
[10:27] generator and uh overcome all these
[10:30] things because you know what we're all
[10:31] overcomers
[10:33] through jesus christ all of us we we may
[10:36] you say well i'm not like brother joe or
[10:38] bill luis well you got jobs tale
[10:40] you got a job still it's not just them
[10:42] everybody's got a job every person's got
[10:44] a job if your job is just to say amen
[10:46] and show up to services
[10:48] that's an overcoming ability that a lot
[10:50] of people don't have so
[10:52] ii peter one
[10:54] start with verse one let's uh let's bow
[10:56] our heads before we get started
[10:58] heavenly father we pray lord that today
[11:02] that you would be held up lord
[11:04] that it would be you father not us that
[11:06] you would be lifted up high
[11:09] above all because we know that there's
[11:10] one thing for sure that as a
[11:12] as a creator as a living god you came so
[11:15] low to us
[11:17] to get us and take us back to where you
[11:19] are father
[11:20] what a mighty god
[11:22] what a mighty king
[11:24] what a lord of lords
[11:26] that would come down and down an old
[11:28] rugged cross
[11:30] for such a worm as i
[11:33] somebody that didn't deserve it lord but
[11:34] you knew that we would there would be a
[11:37] part of us that would want it more than
[11:38] life itself
[11:40] and lord now it's a gift that you give
[11:42] us and it's ours so let us take our gift
[11:44] from you the holy spirit
[11:46] and let us add these virtues to our
[11:48] faith
[11:49] and let us believe in you father forgive
[11:52] us of our sins and many mistakes be the
[11:54] ones that are sick and not here lord
[11:57] the ones that maybe are are a little
[11:59] feeling a little bad here we pray lord
[12:01] that you would
[12:02] as the word goes forth that you will
[12:04] just heal them father let them just
[12:05] forget about what's going on and focus
[12:07] as the man at the gate called beautiful
[12:10] he focused on what peter said and forgot
[12:12] about that he couldn't walk and he stood
[12:14] up and walked
[12:15] father we pray that you just bless us
[12:17] now take care of us be with the
[12:18] missionaries on the foreign fields give
[12:20] them fruit for their labor father we ask

[12:26] jesus name we pray
[12:27] amen
[12:28] second peter 1 verse 1
[12:31] simon peter a servant and apostle of
[12:33] jesus christ to them that have obtained
[12:35] like precious faith with us through the
[12:37] righteousness of god and our savior
[12:39] jesus christ
[12:40] grace and peace
[12:43] grace and peace
[12:46] if you don't want turmoil get into this
[12:48] it'll give you a little peace
[12:50] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[12:52] through the knowledge of god and of
[12:53] jesus our lord according as his divine
[12:56] power hath given unto us all things that
[12:58] pertain to life and godliness so we were
[13:00] talking about the same thing today life
[13:02] your everyday life living in godliness
[13:04] through the knowledge of him that has
[13:06] called us the glory and virtue whereby
[13:08] are giving unto us exceeding great and
[13:10] precious promises that by these what
[13:12] these promises the ones he's made right
[13:14] here you might be partakers of the
[13:16] divine nature having escaped the
[13:17] corruption that is in the world through
[13:19] lust and besides this giving all
[13:21] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[13:23] diverse your knowledge and knowledge
[13:24] temperance temperance patience patience
[13:27] godliness into godliness brotherly
[13:28] kindness and the brother the kindness
[13:30] charity for if these things be in you
[13:33] and abound
[13:34] they make you that you shall neither be
[13:36] barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of
[13:38] our lord jesus christ amen but he that
[13:40] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[13:42] see afar off and hath forgotten that he
[13:44] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[13:46] the rather brethren give diligence to
[13:48] make your calling and election sure for
[13:51] if you do these things
[13:53] you shall never fall you may be seated
[13:55] in the lord that is blessing to the
[13:56] reading of the word
[13:58] now what we're talking about this
[13:59] morning just the background again
[14:00] because it's uh it's something that
[14:04] that uh if you say it 15 times they said
[14:06] you know if you say it 15 times they'll
[14:08] get it so you're on about number seven
[14:11] so you're halfway there
[14:13] to where you can recite this
[14:17] amen there's nothing we can we can
[14:19] remember we can pride ourself
[14:21] remembering all the 50 states
[14:25] how many of you can name the capitals of
[14:26] all 50 states
[14:29] say how many of you knows what i like
[14:32] that what brother brown said he's
[14:33] talking about that guy that was a bible
[14:35] student he's talking about the days and
[14:36] miracles of the past he said he went
[14:37] through about three scriptures and he
[14:38] finally said do you know john 3 16. the
[14:40] guy couldn't even quote any scripture he
[14:43] i believe it's on the statute proper man
[14:46] can you not quote john 3 16 he couldn't
[14:47] quote all the other in john 5 48 and all
[14:49] those like that so he couldn't quote
[14:51] them but
[14:52] it's not our intellectual thinking
[14:56] how many times have you me and all of us
[14:58] have been going through life and we've
[15:00] we've we've
[15:01] god has brought things to our
[15:02] remembrance that we would have never
[15:04] remembered
[15:05] naturally we would have never remembered
[15:07] because he said i'll put in your mouth
[15:09] what you need how many times have you
[15:11] walked away from somebody and said i
[15:12] should have said quit doing that because
[15:14] you know what
[15:16] if you're standing in the in the if
[15:18] you're standing in the protection of the
[15:19] almighty and if you don't say it it's
[15:22] not time it for it to be said all right
[15:24] so you just trust in that i've always
[15:26] all of us have second guessed and said
[15:27] man i should have said well no it wasn't
[15:30] time because you know what if you'd have
[15:31] said that it might have been a stumbling
[15:33] block or it might have been something
[15:34] they couldn't digest at the time so hold
[15:37] that thought though
[15:39] say it a little bit later when you're
[15:40] led to say that because remember the
[15:42] bible tells you you're going to be
[15:43] brought before kings and all these kinds
[15:45] of judges and he said don't worry about
[15:47] it in other words you don't don't study
[15:50] you know the day before
[15:52] don't study the day before he said i'll
[15:54] give you what you need then
[15:56] all right but still you got to study to
[15:58] show yourself approve all right you got
[16:00] to do some studying it's not you don't
[16:01] do no studying then you just sit there
[16:03] and say god just pour it in me
[16:05] well you know who gets there first don't
[16:07] you yeah okay
[16:09] the devil gets there first if you didn't
[16:10] know that
[16:11] he gets there first and then uh
[16:13] he muddles the thing up but we were
[16:15] starting this morning we're looking at
[16:16] the chart now
[16:17] start with justification sanctification
[16:19] the baptism of the holy ghost faith is
[16:21] our foundation right
[16:23] all right and then how we get it is
[16:25] ephesians four
[16:26] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[16:28] evangelists gonna try to go through this
[16:30] pretty quick so we can get to a little
[16:32] more on temperance everybody like
[16:34] temperance that was a good one this
[16:35] morning i like temperance was something
[16:37] that you really think well that's my
[16:39] temper that's my temper no it's control
[16:43] it's not even just control your temper
[16:44] it's control it's it's and i'll read you
[16:47] a quote here in just a few minutes where
[16:48] brother brown talks about supreme power
[16:50] in control so we'll but he gave what
[16:53] some apostles prophets pastors or
[16:55] evangelists and some pastors and
[16:56] teachers for what the perfecting of the
[16:59] saints for the work of the ministry for
[17:01] the edifying of the body of christ till
[17:02] we all come all right so it's a journey
[17:05] till we all come not when you get it but
[17:07] till
[17:08] we all come to the unity of faith and
[17:10] knowledge of the son of god to a perfect
[17:12] man to the measure of the stature of the
[17:14] fullness of christ all right so we know
[17:17] what to get we know who to get it from
[17:20] now we just got to go get it amen all
[17:22] right that's where that bible says
[17:24] diligent you got diligence means you go
[17:26] seek something you got to go for it it's
[17:27] not going to come to you you got to go
[17:28] get it all right so you got then we got
[17:31] now hebrews 11 1.
[17:33] don't ever forget faith faith is what
[17:35] that's the foundation
[17:38] you can't sit there and not believe and
[17:41] get anywhere
[17:43] okay you can't just say well i'm in the
[17:45] message or i'm in this or i'm in that
[17:47] you've got to believe and put yourself
[17:49] in a place to where
[17:52] uh you can believe go to hebrews 11 1.
[17:55] brother bob
[17:58] brother bob is uh taking brother
[18:01] munini's place back there
[18:03] brother anderson
[18:05] but without faith it is impossible
[18:09] impossible to please him
[18:11] i can say that because i can say it
[18:13] right munini is right right brother
[18:15] anderson
[18:16] extra i thought so he said you say it
[18:18] very well i said thank you
[18:20] for he that you've got to be careful but
[18:22] he that cometh to god must believe that
[18:24] he is what he is god he's the creator
[18:26] he's the one he's the one that has given
[18:28] us all this and he is a rewarder
[18:32] what's the reward
[18:33] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[18:35] godliness the statue of a perfect man
[18:37] that's your reward for diligently
[18:40] seeking god how in the world are we
[18:43] going to believe and have faith if we
[18:45] diligently seek something not believing
[18:47] that god's going to give it to us
[18:51] how are we going to do that
[18:53] you got to believe that he's going to
[18:54] give it to you once you get there all
[18:56] right
[18:57] and he's a rewarder of them that
[18:59] diligently seek him hebrews 11 1. now
[19:02] faith is the substance of things hoped
[19:04] for the evidence of things not seen all
[19:07] right so
[19:08] what we're talking about this morning
[19:09] the substance of faith is what you add
[19:13] because that's the substance you got you
[19:15] can't just have faith alone brother
[19:16] brown said faith alone won't do it right
[19:19] that's a shocking statement yeah that a
[19:21] prophet will say well you gotta have
[19:23] faith and he builds his whole
[19:25] he builds his whole sermon on faith and
[19:27] then he says faith alone won't do it
[19:29] right okay so what he's saying he's
[19:31] calling you to another level to a higher
[19:34] level in god
[19:36] because he knew that's just staying at
[19:39] faith
[19:40] nobody changed right
[19:43] even not is including a body change it's
[19:45] just being a little more
[19:47] a little more
[19:48] of a man in god instead of a baby yeah
[19:52] because god don't want a bunch of crying
[19:53] babies right all right you don't want a
[19:54] bunch of crying babies he wants us to
[19:56] grow up in him
[19:57] and have what we were talking like this
[19:59] morning the controlled faith and all
[20:01] these things that we have we virtue
[20:03] faith he wants us to have strong faith
[20:05] he wants us to have knowledge faith
[20:07] knowledge and how to take the word and
[20:09] how to how to be to where
[20:12] where where we can you know
[20:15] let me just be real honest
[20:17] peter didn't have to go back to jesus to
[20:19] get what he had right
[20:21] all right
[20:22] peter didn't have to go to paul
[20:25] to get what he had
[20:27] and that's what brother dale's been
[20:28] doing he's been trying to build you know
[20:30] a lot of preachers and i'm going to say
[20:32] this and i don't care if you like it or
[20:33] not there's a lot of preachers that come
[20:35] they want to meddle in everything you do
[20:37] they want to know how everything's going
[20:38] and they want to pick and choose and you
[20:39] know
[20:40] but you know what that makes babies stay
[20:43] babies
[20:46] one day my dad said look
[20:48] if you're gonna walk ain't happy
[20:50] tomorrow
[20:52] if you're gonna get anywhere walk by
[20:54] yourself
[20:55] same way with us as christians he's
[20:56] trying to build christians where we are
[20:59] individuals that we don't have to call
[21:00] brother dale every 15 minutes
[21:03] i know that's what he's doing he's doing
[21:05] he told brother colley he wanted to get
[21:06] enough where he's wanting to get enough
[21:07] in us to where hey one day if we are
[21:09] separated guess what right
[21:11] you ain't got to go find somebody
[21:14] you got it in use you said well i'm a
[21:16] i'm a woman i'm not a preacher i don't
[21:19] make one hill beans worth of difference
[21:21] to god
[21:23] we're all one the bible says in the body
[21:27] of christ one amen
[21:31] now we know they can't preach
[21:33] but that doesn't mean they can't get a
[21:35] revelation
[21:36] probably sometimes better than men
[21:40] they're wired a little different than we
[21:42] are amen praise the lord
[21:45] anyhow
[21:50] where are we from venus they from mars
[21:51] or something they're on some weird
[21:53] planet somewhere off somewhere
[21:55] but look
[21:57] god wants us all to grow i think
[21:59] sometimes in the message we think well
[22:00] the men's got to do this and the women's
[22:02] got to do this you know if we're all one
[22:03] in christ
[22:05] then we're equal
[22:07] if it goes back to before the fall then
[22:09] it was adam and eve and when god looked
[22:11] at adam and eve he saw one
[22:14] he didn't see a lower form
[22:16] he just saw adam in another form he
[22:19] didn't see a lower form he saw adam in
[22:20] another form called
[22:22] eve and that's why that jesus christ and
[22:24] us are joint heirs
[22:27] whatever jesus got we got right amen if
[22:30] we ever realize that then we'll go
[22:31] somewhere all right because
[22:33] whatever he's got because he had these
[22:37] he had these working in his life and he
[22:39] was that headstone now you and i have
[22:42] got to get back to that place still that
[22:44] headstone now lives in us
[22:46] all right then really john
[22:49] 5 there where it says the world will see
[22:50] me no more
[22:52] but you'll see me right because i'll be
[22:54] with you even in you
[22:56] to the end of the world
[22:58] all right
[23:02] virtue
[23:03] let's look at let's go to uh
[23:05] the chart with virtue and everybody
[23:06] knows that virtue is strength and that's
[23:09] what we must have we must have strong
[23:12] faith
[23:14] that's why i like to call it
[23:16] need to be one that says virtue faith
[23:18] brother bob brother anderson must have
[23:20] hid that one from you
[23:21] on purpose
[23:23] but that should say virtue faith because
[23:25] it is it's not faith and you leave it at
[23:27] the foundation it spurs your faith it
[23:29] comes up to where it says thank you
[23:31] that's pretty quick
[23:33] virtue faith which is a strong faith
[23:36] you and i
[23:38] remember
[23:39] to have strong faith we must do what
[23:43] exercise you must exercise your faith we
[23:46] have not because we
[23:49] ask not all right now that's pretty
[23:51] simple but to me that's virtue faith
[23:54] that's taking the faith you have and
[23:55] asking
[23:57] believing that god's going to do it
[23:59] amen
[24:01] that's what we got to get to because
[24:02] remember just regular faith won't do it
[24:07] baby form faith is good that gets you
[24:09] started with the new birth but that
[24:11] alone will not do it right all right it
[24:13] takes a virtue faith or a strong faith
[24:17] brother brown said one time you know
[24:18] he's talking about uh jousting he said
[24:20] it's not just that you got a joust he
[24:22] said when you stick that thing into the
[24:24] heart of that opponent you got to make
[24:26] sure you push it in it takes a strong
[24:28] arm of faith
[24:30] to handle the devil and that's what
[24:31] we're looking at god is now adding
[24:34] something stronger to equip us for the
[24:37] journey right all right for our journey
[24:39] to to go on all right so now let's look
[24:42] at
[24:45] knowledge we don't have to stay on board
[24:46] we we've run through virtue a few times
[24:48] knowledge
[24:49] remember what we're talking about this
[24:50] afternoon this morning knowledge faith
[24:52] is what discernment
[24:54] the ability to decide right from wrong
[24:56] the ability to discern
[24:59] is a requirement of all christians
[25:03] totally a requirement of christianity is
[25:05] to be able to discern
[25:07] right from wrong
[25:09] like i said before how many times have
[25:10] we been in meetings where we we hear
[25:12] somebody preach a sermon and
[25:14] and
[25:15] we hear
[25:16] you know something that that maybe is
[25:18] not exactly the truth and you feel that
[25:21] little that little bump right
[25:24] there's a little something goes off in
[25:25] you well what is that to me that's
[25:27] knowledge faith brother dale and the
[25:29] ministry here has put enough knowledge
[25:32] faith
[25:33] where we can acquire it
[25:36] he can't give it to us
[25:38] he can put it up where we can get it all
[25:40] right so we can get that knowledge faith
[25:42] and we can sit there in the crowd of 600
[25:44] people
[25:46] and not feel bad because the first thing
[25:48] the devil's going to do is say well you
[25:49] think you are writing all these 600
[25:51] people wrong you know the devil he works
[25:53] with numbers
[25:54] god don't care a thing about numbers he
[25:56] takes gideon and says gideon i want you
[25:58] to fight a battle 30 000 people he said
[26:02] we got it whipped god said no
[26:04] you don't that's too many
[26:06] that's right
[26:07] cut sit down
[26:09] gabriel said we're still okay we're
[26:11] about even now
[26:13] god said nah
[26:14] we're not using that many
[26:16] got down to 300 people
[26:19] and they destroyed an army of like 30
[26:22] 000 people 20 some thousand people with
[26:25] 300 people so god don't deal with
[26:26] numbers but the devil does the devil
[26:28] thinks if he can get enough piled over
[26:30] here on his side he can defeat
[26:33] god with it he can get everybody on his
[26:34] side see because you know what he's
[26:36] selfish oh yeah satan is a selfish
[26:40] selfish person it's always i i mean me
[26:43] selfish stuff god's always said hey
[26:45] gideon you take 300 and you go down
[26:47] there and you get the work done so god
[26:50] you know he come down and uh
[26:52] and save the whole world with one man
[26:56] so he's not worried about numbers i'm
[26:57] not worried about numbers but satan he
[26:59] likes to get those numbers together you
[27:00] know but so he says well 600 people out
[27:03] of 600 people you guys must be wrong
[27:06] and then but still something does what
[27:08] that anchor still holds in there and you
[27:11] walk away from that service going thank
[27:13] you lord
[27:15] not thank you that all and really not
[27:18] thank you that 600 people were wrong
[27:20] no your heart bleeds for that amount of
[27:22] people that have been ill taught but you
[27:24] say thank you god that i was able to
[27:27] discern
[27:28] the truth from the error and to pull it
[27:31] apart and then amen the right part and
[27:33] then oh me oh me the bad part
[27:36] are the part that's not right because
[27:38] look people the only way we're going to
[27:39] take a body change is to be 100
[27:42] what jesus preached for three and a half
[27:44] years is that headstone we must be 100
[27:48] true
[27:49] in our word or there's no body change
[27:54] 100
[27:56] not one word off
[27:57] right
[27:58] 100
[28:00] what that man preached for that three
[28:02] and a half years it's got to be back in
[28:04] the end time
[28:05] or we don't take a body change right
[28:08] amen
[28:09] so there's where knowledge faith comes
[28:11] in
[28:12] faith to discern
[28:14] and then when you discern it
[28:17] what do you have to do you have to
[28:18] believe what you deserved
[28:20] just like that situation with that you
[28:22] know you got to walk out of that
[28:23] auditorium and say god
[28:25] i know
[28:27] the truth
[28:28] you showed me the truth
[28:31] you got to believe that
[28:35] knowledge faith
[28:36] what is faith faith is belief
[28:40] so you got to have a knowledge that what
[28:41] you believe is right
[28:43] all right
[28:44] so you put all these things together and
[28:46] because wisdom you come back to the word
[28:48] wisdom which is the ability to think and
[28:50] act using knowledge see what we've done
[28:52] is is we and i hope you don't mind me
[28:54] using that that example but what we done
[28:57] we took the knowledge that we had
[28:59] previously heard
[29:02] all right yeah we're sitting in this
[29:03] auditorium 600 people the brother gets
[29:05] up and he's preaching you know just say
[29:07] the river jordan doctrine he's talking
[29:08] about you know jesus not being god well
[29:10] everybody else is up shouting and we're
[29:11] not
[29:12] well what we're doing is is we're if we
[29:14] had not had something
[29:17] to build on
[29:19] a foundation before
[29:22] amen
[29:23] a foundation before if we had that
[29:25] knowledge we carried that knowledge with
[29:28] us
[29:29] to the meeting
[29:30] we didn't get it there
[29:32] because all them other ones got
[29:34] knowledge
[29:35] but it wasn't knowledge faith
[29:37] it was an it was a human man's knowledge
[29:40] not godly knowledge
[29:42] all right so we brought that in because
[29:44] wisdom is the ability to think and act
[29:46] using knowledge
[29:48] experience understanding common sense
[29:50] and insight and then we we read what
[29:53] brother brown said it would take a group
[29:55] of people with prophetic insight right
[29:58] the only way you're going to be able to
[29:59] understand any of this is you're going
[30:01] to have to go from the natural
[30:03] realm to the supernatural realm because
[30:06] these are not natural virtues these are
[30:08] supernatural virtues
[30:12] right
[30:13] sure you can have these virtues man
[30:15] virtues but to have these kind of
[30:17] virtues that the prophet of god is
[30:18] talking about and that peter was talking
[30:20] about you must have supernatural
[30:23] understanding
[30:24] all right
[30:25] not super-duper
[30:28] right everybody gets super-duper
[30:30] revelations and they're mostly wrong
[30:32] but to have a supernatural revelation to
[30:35] have supernatural knowledge that puts
[30:37] you in another category
[30:41] i just believe it does
[30:43] now temperance
[30:45] this morning we were talking about
[30:46] temperance
[30:47] bring temperance faith
[30:49] and and i
[30:51] i thank everybody not everybody but most
[30:53] of you that came up to me and said that
[30:55] they really enjoyed it because because
[30:56] most time we look at this right here and
[30:58] the first thing we do is we look at
[31:00] anger and madness and mean and i got to
[31:04] get rid of my anger and you know i got
[31:07] it's really not all that
[31:10] it's control
[31:12] temperance means self-control
[31:16] then you can put whatever you want to
[31:18] underneath that
[31:20] self-control of of not tattling brother
[31:22] branham he you know being a tattletail
[31:24] loose lip and all that stuff or your
[31:26] temper or
[31:28] um
[31:31] some people are
[31:32] are um
[31:34] like me your mouth runs before your
[31:36] brain has a time to catch up
[31:40] i raise mine brother dick brother okay
[31:42] brother yes lord bless you i'm in a
[31:44] group thank you
[31:46] they say group therapy's good
[31:52] they're older than i am so i got a long
[31:54] way to go
[31:56] temperance faith but look
[31:58] temperance is what controlled faith
[32:02] it's a faith that you have
[32:04] with control behind it
[32:06] all right same way with brother branham
[32:08] the instance remember when he walks into
[32:10] the house
[32:11] now see to me that's temperance when
[32:14] brother brown walks in the house he said
[32:16] there'd been a hundred people in my
[32:18] house all day
[32:20] devils and people won't be prayed for
[32:22] him people prophesying thus saith the
[32:23] lord brother ram you've got to go here
[32:25] and he said my wife was crying my kids
[32:28] were fighting joseph was throwing things
[32:31] and he said when i walked in he said i
[32:33] knew right then i had to change the
[32:36] situation
[32:37] now he could have walked in there like
[32:39] most of us
[32:40] and said woman where's my food
[32:43] and you should duck when you say that
[32:48] get up and beat the kids
[32:51] and make it worse
[32:53] what brother brown day
[32:58] he put on an apron yeah
[33:01] he's you remember he kept saying now god
[33:04] he kept touching me to he said he's
[33:06] honey i i i saw him dress over there and
[33:08] she's like a dress what are you talking
[33:10] about a dress all this junk going on
[33:12] talking about he said i just kept saying
[33:14] lord
[33:15] what was it that was controlled faith
[33:18] to me that was temperance in total
[33:20] control brother branham he said remember
[33:22] 10 minutes later he said sarah and becky
[33:26] were playing together
[33:28] joseph was you know doing what he was
[33:30] doing and she was wanting to go look at
[33:32] that blouse
[33:33] now what that was a control that was a
[33:36] controlled faith
[33:38] that's the only and you say well that
[33:39] was patience well that was patience too
[33:41] but the first thing was is if we would
[33:43] have walked in first thing would happen
[33:45] is something would have rose up and said
[33:49] you need to be doing this you need you
[33:50] understand what i'm saying but he walks
[33:53] in and says look he says lord
[33:55] this thing's got to change
[33:57] so he took that controlled faith or
[34:00] temperance
[34:01] and changed the whole situation
[34:03] changed the whole thing without having
[34:04] to whip the kids and without having to
[34:07] say anything wrong to his wife
[34:09] and it's what we were talking about this
[34:10] morning that controlled faith it says i
[34:13] believe i can see he walked in knowing
[34:16] that he could change that situation
[34:18] just by being in control all right you
[34:21] want a little more of that let's go on a
[34:23] little bit further
[34:24] let's go to
[34:26] um
[34:27] we won't read titus or any of those but
[34:29] you can go to quote number nine if you
[34:30] want to what we were talking about this
[34:32] morning on temperance
[34:34] faith and i hope you enjoyed that
[34:36] because it really helped me because
[34:37] because i didn't really even see that it
[34:39] was it was that much of a control
[34:43] when i was downstairs but
[34:45] because look tempers doesn't mean stop
[34:47] drinking alcohol either no no tempest
[34:49] doesn't mean alcohol it's cured not in
[34:51] this case
[34:52] this is bible temperance holy spirit
[34:54] temperance that's just one of the lusts
[34:56] of the flesh
[34:58] what i was talking about you know if
[34:59] you're still doing all those things
[35:00] you're not even in the body you don't
[35:02] need to take communion you don't you
[35:04] need to get yourself right
[35:06] then you can come into the body of
[35:07] christ and you get all the benefits all
[35:10] right
[35:11] that's just one of the lusts of the
[35:13] flesh but we're talking about holy
[35:14] spirit temperance that means how to
[35:16] control your tongue not be a toddler how
[35:19] to control your temper not fly off every
[35:21] time anybody speaks cross to you oh my
[35:24] oh temperance well i've read you said
[35:26] boy a lot of us are going to fall off
[35:27] before we get started aren't we
[35:30] and these things add temperance to it oh
[35:32] temperance how to answering kindness
[35:34] when wrath
[35:35] is spoken to you all right and then you
[35:37] keep going on to save time go to the
[35:39] next go the next quote
[35:41] number 10
[35:42] now if you got this like that add it to
[35:44] your faith if you still blow up and sass
[35:46] and fuss and stew and carry on uh huh
[35:48] you ain't got no you can't add that
[35:51] because it won't add see it won't
[35:52] vulcanize
[35:54] you couldn't take a piece of rubber you
[35:55] know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron
[35:57] and that's what we try to do a lot of
[35:59] times we still got that old stony heart
[36:02] we got that old heart of stone and we're
[36:03] trying to vulcanize god's spirit with it
[36:06] and it won't work
[36:08] all right you got to have the heart of
[36:09] flesh to attach it to all right same
[36:12] thing with here a piece of iron it just
[36:13] won't work no it's got to be flexible
[36:16] just like the rubber is
[36:18] and when your faith and your temperance
[36:20] becomes the same kind of holy ghost
[36:22] temperance that he had
[36:24] then it will vulcanize with him you're
[36:27] added to it when you virtue is like his
[36:30] then add to it when your knowledge is
[36:32] like his
[36:33] same thing all the way down all right
[36:35] let's go to 10a i pulled this one up
[36:36] just a few minutes ago and i want to
[36:38] read this one to you this is neat why
[36:40] are my people so talked about that's a
[36:41] real good message to read by the way
[36:43] why are people so tossed about if you've
[36:45] been tossed about read that message
[36:47] all right some people get the wrong
[36:49] impression of what the anointing is
[36:50] remember we talk about this at the end
[36:51] of the service this afternoon this
[36:54] morning was
[36:55] was its control temperance is control
[36:58] all right
[36:59] did you ever think of that when was the
[37:00] greatest anointing ever give to anyone
[37:03] and what did they do when they had the
[37:06] anointing
[37:07] it's talking about jesus christ right in
[37:09] luke chapter 4 the greatest anointing
[37:11] was ever given to anyone was jesus
[37:13] christ
[37:14] we have the spirit by measure he had it
[37:17] without measure and one day he had
[37:19] entered in the temple and picked up the
[37:21] scroll and read said the spirit of god
[37:23] is upon me for he has anointed me to
[37:25] preach the acceptable year to bind up
[37:27] the broken hearts heal the sick give
[37:29] sight to the blind and now we would
[37:32] think if such anointing was on him that
[37:35] had been prophesied 800 years before it
[37:38] would come and here he was with that
[37:40] type of anointing the full blessing and
[37:43] anointing of the lord upon him we would
[37:45] want to run all over the building
[37:48] scream and holler yeah but the bible
[37:50] said he laid down the scroll set down
[37:53] and precious word proceeded from his
[37:55] mouth that's what he done under the
[37:58] anointing
[37:59] the anointing is not emotions right the
[38:02] anointing is supreme power in
[38:07] control
[38:08] control faith supreme power in control
[38:12] like knowing exactly what and how
[38:16] and look what he said
[38:19] and that's what's here
[38:21] he was saying it was here
[38:23] and that's what's here the anointing is
[38:25] not emotion the anointing is supreme
[38:27] power
[38:29] and control you know when jesus looked
[38:31] down at those scrolls you know what he
[38:32] did
[38:34] he identified his self
[38:37] in the word
[38:38] that's the same way with me and you if
[38:40] we ever identify ourself in that word
[38:42] and he knew that word was talking about
[38:45] him well i figured maybe inside of him
[38:48] he wanted to get up and run around and
[38:49] shout
[38:50] but he knew he had a word he had
[38:52] something to do that's right so he oh he
[38:55] closed the book
[38:58] he laid down the scroll sat down in
[38:59] precious words in other words he
[39:01] preached him a good sermon i bet you he
[39:03] preached them a just a monotone it
[39:06] didn't get any loud you know there
[39:07] wasn't a lot of hollering
[39:10] the anointing is not emotions
[39:12] so controlled what we when we look at
[39:15] temperance when we looked at temperance
[39:17] before
[39:18] to me that's an emotion
[39:20] you got temper that's an emotion right
[39:23] we take all the emotions the anointing
[39:26] is supreme power in control the
[39:28] anointing is not emotions the anointing
[39:30] in other words what he's saying is you
[39:32] don't have to be way up here for the
[39:34] anointing to hit you or way down here
[39:36] for the anointing to hit you amen you
[39:38] just got to know where you're at in the
[39:40] word it's when the anointing will strike
[39:42] amen you got to know where you're at in
[39:44] the word identify yourself
[39:47] not your pastor not your brother sister
[39:49] or mother you got to you got to identify
[39:52] lord this is where i'm at right here
[39:54] all right now look if that's where
[39:56] you're supposed to be talk about
[39:58] matching pieces if that's where you're
[40:00] supposed to be and god saw you in that
[40:02] because look he said this was prophesied
[40:05] 800 years before
[40:08] jesus is reading a scroll that somebody
[40:10] said the spirit of the lord is upon me
[40:12] 800 years ago
[40:15] it was talk he said hey that's me
[40:18] that's me that's what i'm here for
[40:20] that's my commission
[40:23] that's what he done under the anointing
[40:25] same thing with you and i you get
[40:27] temperance it's not going to just
[40:28] absolutely make you cause you know what
[40:32] let's just take brother gary krantz
[40:35] hey buddy
[40:37] i don't believe he'd get well i've seen
[40:39] him upset a few times i've never seen
[40:40] him mad
[40:42] that's right okay
[40:44] i don't think you could get him mad
[40:46] that i know of
[40:50] but see that's him in his nature to a
[40:53] degree
[40:55] but boy being born again makes him real
[40:56] me you know real my real me he he
[40:58] married julie so that's enough them
[41:02] that's enough to get you going anyway
[41:06] temperance
[41:08] patience brother sorry we're getting
[41:09] patient in just a minute i'll use her
[41:10] for that in a minute
[41:13] but do you understand what i'm saying
[41:16] to to just say well
[41:18] i need temperance because i got
[41:20] a bad temper that's not all that right
[41:23] let's work on what let's say well i got
[41:26] a temper i got to get rid of it no let's
[41:28] say well i got a problem god help me
[41:31] control
[41:34] control
[41:35] how to control brother since how to
[41:37] control well i got it on blasphemous
[41:40] names but i didn't bring it he says how
[41:41] to control your ungodly temper
[41:43] that's what he said how to control it
[41:45] that's the same thing with all of us we
[41:47] need plenty of control and temperance so
[41:49] let's let's put temperance as a
[41:52] controlling factor because when he
[41:54] controls look you're getting on up here
[41:56] pretty good now
[41:58] yeah you know you get on up there we got
[42:00] patience godless brother kindness but
[42:01] that baby right there i'm telling you
[42:03] that's kind of the middle too
[42:06] that's the one where you really gonna
[42:07] have to move through that knowing that
[42:10] you have now a controlled faith a faith
[42:13] that will control all situations
[42:16] brother branham that's the same way he
[42:17] was i mean you know brother billy paul
[42:19] was amazed a lot of times that and how
[42:21] his his daddy was so in control why that
[42:24] wasn't that seventh grade education man
[42:26] in control
[42:28] he was moving over and letting that
[42:30] control that was in him come out
[42:33] all right you say well i got a temper
[42:35] well if you got the holy ghost you got
[42:37] one inside of you that don't have one
[42:42] that doesn't have one
[42:45] so who's winning
[42:47] you feed this one
[42:48] he wins you feed this one he wins
[42:52] kind of simple
[42:54] all right like brother brown now
[42:56] remember brother branham remember the
[42:57] lady told him said tie them knots around
[42:59] your finger
[43:01] when you get mad tie ten you know tie
[43:02] knots around your finger
[43:04] remember he said he got mad at them boys
[43:06] he said he tied about two knots throw
[43:08] the string down and i'll off you know
[43:10] off to beat them kids up or try to
[43:13] but he had that was a temper
[43:15] and the lady was trying to get him to do
[43:17] it by human
[43:18] ability but when he come up to the
[43:20] born-again experience
[43:22] i don't believe he could have done
[43:23] nothing to him
[43:24] to make him upset all right i'm not
[43:26] upset now we get upset i'm talking about
[43:28] temper temper is red-faced and mad yeah
[43:32] yeah i mean we all get upset and
[43:34] frustrated we get frustrated at ourself
[43:37] more than anybody i get frustrated at me
[43:39] than anybody else
[43:41] but that's just human nature but then
[43:43] you know god you've got to see that god
[43:45] has put something in you to control that
[43:47] right all right so we have control faith
[43:49] which is temperance all right
[43:53] and let's define that if you want to
[43:55] brother
[43:56] um now let's don't don't worry about it
[43:58] don't worry about it let's go to quote
[43:59] number nine
[44:03] go back up one i want to read this one
[44:05] again
[44:06] go back to nine there you go
[44:11] cause look
[44:16] look
[44:18] if it's the right kind of virtue right
[44:21] then add knowledge if it's the right
[44:22] kind of knowledge
[44:24] now we're going to add temperance and
[44:25] then temper if it's the right kind of
[44:27] temperance right that's once you get see
[44:29] it's what he's saying the right kind of
[44:30] temperance is what control
[44:33] so the right kind of temperance is the
[44:35] controlling factor
[44:37] in this whole thing and to me it's going
[44:40] to control
[44:42] not only you but see you got to look
[44:44] look at knowledge look how that thing
[44:45] builds on top of each other you take the
[44:47] knowledge that you have
[44:50] and to me if you have the right kind of
[44:52] knowledge that's what's saying here if
[44:53] you've got the right kind of knowledge
[44:55] then that right kind of temperance is
[44:56] going to lay right on top of that that's
[44:58] right
[44:59] because remember knowledge is knowing
[45:02] discerning discerning good from evil or
[45:05] right from wrong and then right there
[45:07] lay's temperance to control that part of
[45:10] you
[45:12] that you've discerned this part's right
[45:14] then god's going to send you down this
[45:15] avenue and control that he's going to
[45:18] control you
[45:20] i
[45:21] we just have a lot of problem with
[45:22] controlling ourselves
[45:24] we try to control ourselves we can't do
[45:26] that we got to let go and let god do it
[45:29] he said well brother that's too simple i
[45:31] don't think that's too simple i think
[45:32] being having controlled faith is is to
[45:35] me it's
[45:36] it's paramount before you get to
[45:38] patients
[45:39] because boy patience we're going to get
[45:41] to it right now in just a second let's
[45:42] go to patients now
[45:44] because it's the next one and it's
[45:46] patience faith
[45:48] we got to go we got to continue with the
[45:50] faith go to patience faith
[45:53] because remember it's faith all the way
[45:54] up
[45:55] patience faith now what is patience
[45:58] go to luke 21 19.
[46:04] luke 21 19 says
[46:09] in your patience
[46:11] possess ye your souls
[46:14] now you don't have two souls that ain't
[46:15] a two-soul doctrine all right
[46:18] he's talking about all of us
[46:20] in your patience
[46:22] possess ye
[46:23] your
[46:24] souls now watch the definition of
[46:26] patience go to patient the definition
[46:29] keep that in mind
[46:39] endurance
[46:41] steadfastness constancy
[46:44] what is constancy if you know what to
[46:46] control you can stay constant
[46:49] if you know what you can control you
[46:51] stay constant with that all right
[46:53] because you know what
[46:54] how can you believe something
[46:56] and then you get up so far and you say
[46:58] well i don't believe that anymore
[47:01] i believe this
[47:02] well
[47:05] not in this people you can't do that
[47:08] you can't do that now if you're not born
[47:10] again sure you can come up to say well
[47:12] say matthew 28 19 you know say well
[47:15] baptism named the lord jesus christ
[47:16] that's exactly correct and then two
[47:18] years later say no i don't believe that
[47:20] anymore
[47:21] now that don't put you in the bot that
[47:23] does that's not discerning the right way
[47:26] no
[47:27] we take
[47:28] the baptism in the name of the lord
[47:29] jesus christ all the way from faith
[47:32] all the way up and it's enduring faith
[47:35] or it's faith that keeps going watch
[47:38] this right here steadfastness constancy
[47:40] endurance in the new testament it's the
[47:43] characteristic of a man who is not
[47:45] swerved from his deliberate purpose
[47:48] now what was jesus supreme power in
[47:50] control he knew who he was and he knew
[47:54] the purpose he came here you got every
[47:56] one of you brothers and sisters
[47:57] everybody down to the children if you're
[47:59] born again you got a purpose
[48:02] god has given you a purpose
[48:04] and that purpose is up to you to fulfill
[48:07] it right
[48:09] it's up to you to fulfill it
[48:12] all right
[48:13] the characteristic of a man who has not
[48:15] swerved just like brother nick said
[48:16] brother dick said uh you know some
[48:18] things happen to me and you
[48:21] you need the glory in that
[48:24] tribulation worketh
[48:29] listen
[48:32] the ones that god loved
[48:34] he chastened
[48:37] and if he didn't know you could make it
[48:39] through it he wouldn't put it on you
[48:42] got it
[48:44] listen and i'm i'm just being honest
[48:46] with you if you come to a place right
[48:48] here and you say well i can't get rid of
[48:50] all this and i can't be in control
[48:51] that's where you're going to stay
[48:53] that's where you're going to stay
[48:55] and god knew that
[48:57] but you don't that's right so you've got
[48:59] to run we'll talk about this in just a
[49:01] minute with paul he's talking about
[49:02] running the race
[49:04] i think paul knew his purpose
[49:07] and he knew one thing for sure he wasn't
[49:10] going to see the coming of the lord
[49:11] right
[49:13] right he wasn't going to see the
[49:14] resurrection alive so he was trying to
[49:17] get the people to see that but he knew
[49:20] his purpose was though is to do one
[49:22] thing and that was to get a people ready
[49:24] at that moment
[49:26] all right he wasn't trying to get
[49:27] luther's people ready because he didn't
[49:29] even know who a man named martin luther
[49:30] was but he might have preached on
[49:32] justification he might have preached on
[49:34] these things but he didn't know the
[49:35] man's name was martin luther that come
[49:37] on down a little bit further but he
[49:38] preached what he did to the first church
[49:40] age people
[49:41] but it was so profound that it became
[49:44] the foundation for all seven church ages
[49:47] right all right because he was a prophet
[49:50] but this word enduring patience he said
[49:53] well i gotta have patience
[49:56] with my wife or patience with my
[49:59] brother branham i'll read it here in
[50:00] just a second
[50:02] he's going to tell you to have patience
[50:03] with first but let's read right here
[50:06] the characteristics of a man who has not
[50:08] swerved from his deliberate
[50:11] purpose and his loyalty to faith and
[50:15] piety
[50:16] by even the greatest
[50:20] trials
[50:22] and sufferings
[50:26] about that
[50:28] patient enduring sustaining
[50:31] perseverance listen this has been a long
[50:34] journey remember sight and time is god's
[50:36] worst enemy
[50:38] because we get
[50:40] as we get more
[50:42] down the road
[50:43] we tend to lose a lot of this because
[50:45] we're human beings all right but the
[50:47] characteristic of a man who has not
[50:49] swerved from his deliberate purpose
[50:52] see that's a confident person that you
[50:54] come up to the statue of a perfect man
[50:56] you get the patience
[50:57] patience to me is confidence
[51:00] because when everything else is going
[51:02] wild the 600 people are shouting about
[51:04] whatever the guy was preaching brother
[51:05] was preaching on and then here you see
[51:07] it
[51:08] man you just got to have patience
[51:10] all right
[51:12] let's go to the next one let's go to
[51:13] romans 5
[51:15] verse 1.
[51:17] and we're going to recap this next
[51:18] sunday
[51:20] therefore being justified by faith
[51:24] we have peace with god through our lord
[51:27] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[51:30] by faith
[51:32] into this grace wherein we stand
[51:36] brother branham said one time he said if
[51:38] you've done everything you've prayed you
[51:40] fasted he said stand
[51:42] that's our problem people that's we just
[51:44] don't have enough patience to just stand
[51:46] there when you think a whole are all
[51:49] hells against you and your kids and your
[51:51] family and ever stand there
[51:53] that's what abraham did that's why he's
[51:54] the father of the faith he stood there
[51:57] all right
[51:58] wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope
[52:01] of the glory of god and not only so but
[52:03] we glory in tribulation also
[52:09] that's a hard one
[52:11] knowing
[52:12] all right let's go back to knowledge
[52:14] knowing that tribulation worketh
[52:17] patience
[52:18] and patience what experience and
[52:21] experience hope amen knowing that
[52:24] tribulation
[52:25] worketh patience the trials of our faith
[52:29] which is what much more precious than
[52:31] gold
[52:32] is showing us patience
[52:37] and we think well i gotta have patience
[52:38] with this one or that one the other
[52:39] let's just keep reading hebrews 10.
[52:41] we'll see what brother brown said first
[52:42] thing have patience with
[52:44] for you have need of patience
[52:47] that after you have done the will of god
[52:49] you might receive the promise
[52:52] for ye have need of patience
[52:54] that after you've done the will of god
[52:56] you might receive the promise
[52:58] brother brown talks about people and
[53:00] you've seen
[53:01] people that go out above the plan of god
[53:04] what happens he said it's a train wreck
[53:07] it's a train wreck we got to stay with
[53:09] the program of god not go out past the
[53:12] will of god this says
[53:14] after that you've done the will of god
[53:18] you'll receive the promise right right
[53:20] all right after you have done the will
[53:22] of god you might receive the promise all
[53:24] right let's go to hebrews 12 1 and two
[53:29] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[53:31] about was so great a cloud of witness
[53:33] let us lay aside every weight and the
[53:35] sin with just so easily beset us and let
[53:37] us run with
[53:39] patience
[53:40] the race that is set before us looking
[53:43] under jesus the author and finish of our
[53:44] faith who for the joy that was set
[53:46] before him there's that word
[53:50] endured right endured the cross
[53:53] despising the shame and is set down at
[53:55] the right hand
[53:56] of the throne of god run with patience
[54:00] the race that is set before us
[54:03] looking under jesus the altar and finish
[54:04] of our faith
[54:06] now look let's go to james 1
[54:09] verse 2.
[54:12] james says my brethren counted all joy
[54:15] when you fall
[54:16] into many temptations the word divers
[54:19] means many
[54:22] one more time my brethren
[54:24] count it joy
[54:27] that's a hard one
[54:32] count it all joy when you fall into
[54:35] divers temptations look
[54:37] knowing this
[54:38] see there you got to go back to the
[54:40] knowledge you got to go back to that
[54:41] knowledge faith knowing this
[54:44] that the trying of your faith worketh
[54:47] patience
[54:48] but let patience have her perfect work
[54:52] work that you may be perfect and entire
[54:56] wanting
[54:57] nothing now patience is pretty powerful
[55:00] that's a pretty powerful statement right
[55:01] there knowing this that the trying of
[55:04] your faith worked with patience that's
[55:05] why i said you can't leave faith faith
[55:08] when you're going through a trial what's
[55:09] going to hold you
[55:12] your faith is going to have to hold you
[55:14] because you know what circumstances
[55:17] your brain
[55:19] your thoughts
[55:20] your carnal ideas are not going to get
[55:23] you through that
[55:25] that's where many people fall
[55:27] they don't just stand
[55:31] say god i've done all i can do now look
[55:34] if you happen he's going to remind you
[55:35] of that
[55:37] okay if he said lord i've done all i can
[55:39] do
[55:40] he's going to say now how many times you
[55:41] missed church
[55:42] last month
[55:43] oh
[55:45] well let's go back and do the let's go
[55:46] back to the elementary get the abc's
[55:48] right
[55:49] yeah then let's work on this
[55:51] but when you've done all brother brown
[55:53] said you've done everything and why
[55:54] christ speak he says when you've done
[55:56] everything he said you stand there right
[55:58] hard to stand sometimes but you stand
[56:00] there stand there and believe for your
[56:03] children your husband wife parents
[56:05] whatever but you got to stand there and
[56:06] believe it
[56:08] and not see anything at all
[56:12] see
[56:13] patience why do you need patience
[56:16] why would i need patience with hannah my
[56:19] daughter if she was sitting on the front
[56:20] row full of the holy ghost
[56:23] i don't need patience when she's sitting
[56:25] there
[56:26] enjoying the word of god and groaning in
[56:28] the word of god i don't need patience
[56:29] for that
[56:31] the patience is i don't see her here and
[56:33] i know what she's doing that's the
[56:35] patience you gotta say god i believe
[56:37] your word and this is where i'm gonna
[56:38] stand
[56:39] cause knowing
[56:42] knowing
[56:44] with that controlled faith of temperance
[56:47] you stand there and say god you said it
[56:50] it's gotta happen
[56:53] you said it it's gotta happen
[56:56] now look our problem is i want you to
[56:58] watch this next one this is a good quote
[57:00] right here now it doesn't have a whole
[57:01] lot to do with the
[57:03] with the virtues but it does
[57:06] 1957 what does it take to make a
[57:08] christian life

[57:32] these things are what the holy spirit
[57:34] controls
[57:36] what do you say it was
[57:38] our emotion our emotions
[57:41] our emotions is not so much as jumping
[57:43] up and down
[57:45] you could do that a shin dig will bring
[57:47] that to you for those of you that don't
[57:49] know what a shin dig is
[57:52] it's a hoedown for those of you that
[57:54] know what a hold down is watch hee-haw
[57:59] but a shin dig is what they used to go
[58:01] it's a dance all right it's an
[58:03] uncontrollable dance i guess you might
[58:04] call it but a shindig will bring that to
[58:07] you but the holy spirit brings you into
[58:10] operation
[58:12] or in what what did we just talk about
[58:15] control temperance control of god that
[58:19] you walk see everything i read now i see
[58:22] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[58:24] kind everything brother brown says i see
[58:25] it because i saw it in this right here
[58:27] all right you could do that a shin dig
[58:29] will bring that to you but the holy
[58:30] spirit brings you into operation are in
[58:33] control of god that you walk in peace
[58:37] and in love and in joy with long
[58:39] suffering
[58:40] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[58:42] roll it on up
[58:44] you see it isn't something that you do
[58:49] it's something the holy spirit does in
[58:52] you
[58:53] you see it's no longer an intellectual
[58:56] thought of your own
[58:58] it's a subconscious
[59:02] moving of the holy spirit oh i wish i
[59:05] could i wish i could shout the praises
[59:07] of god around the world to that
[59:10] church of the living god lula church
[59:13] there's where our pentecostal move
[59:15] failed
[59:16] we have some man-made musical clap hands
[59:19] jump up and down emotion
[59:20] when if we go back out in the street and
[59:23] the holy spirit doesn't govern our lives
[59:25] to cooperate with that
[59:27] we have not got the holy spirit
[59:31] i wish we could admit that but look he
[59:33] said that's not skim milk but brother
[59:35] that's what the church needs only life
[59:37] can come by the holy spirit
[59:40] but look right here it isn't something
[59:42] you do when you get up into these
[59:43] virtues it's not some you can't learn it
[59:46] from a book
[59:49] it's got to be like brother brown said
[59:50] it's got to be a supernatural knowledge
[59:53] a supernatural virtue a supernatural
[59:56] temperance now a supernatural patience
[1:00:00] it's the holy spirit does in you you see
[1:00:02] it's no longer an intellectual thought
[1:00:05] of your own right it's a subconscious
[1:00:08] moving
[1:00:09] of the holy spirit right see that makes
[1:00:12] it supernatural it's a subconscious
[1:00:14] moving oh i wish i'd shout
[1:00:16] the praises in the world for that but i
[1:00:19] caught that one and i thought man i'm
[1:00:20] going to read that because it's really
[1:00:21] good
[1:00:22] at this point we must realize listen
[1:00:25] when you get to that words patience
[1:00:26] right there you ought to know one
[1:00:28] thing's for sure
[1:00:29] it's not you
[1:00:31] it's not the old you doing any of that
[1:00:34] because the old you
[1:00:37] is down there at the bottom still
[1:00:39] babying around crying daddy daddy and
[1:00:41] can't get along with your neighbor
[1:00:43] all right
[1:00:44] come on people
[1:00:48] but once you realize you get up to that
[1:00:50] you know what that ought to bring such a
[1:00:52] peace right that ought to bring look
[1:00:55] that you walk
[1:00:56] a control of god that you walk in what
[1:00:58] peace and in love and in joy
[1:01:01] with long suffering goodness meekness
[1:01:03] and all the nine fruits of the spirit
[1:01:05] because you can actually take the nine
[1:01:06] fruits with the spirit and run them in
[1:01:07] all these two it's the same thing all
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:10] so let's go to quote number 12 and let's
[1:01:12] see what brother brown says about
[1:01:13] patience
[1:01:15] now then after that fourthly
[1:01:18] this statue of a perfect man
[1:01:20] sometimes we forget to read that for
[1:01:21] people that are listening the ones that
[1:01:22] are watching can see it the statue of a
[1:01:25] perfect man in 1962 then after that
[1:01:27] fourthly you want to add patience to
[1:01:30] your faith
[1:01:31] if you've got faith it worketh patience
[1:01:33] the bible said we just read that
[1:01:35] so this is patience now what's the next
[1:01:37] thing going to build this stature you
[1:01:39] know god has got real material
[1:01:41] in his building
[1:01:43] see how short we are brother sister see
[1:01:46] see why
[1:01:47] where we're at yes sir see we have glory
[1:01:51] we have shouts and things because we got
[1:01:53] faith
[1:01:54] but when we come down to these things
[1:01:57] here i believe he's pointing to that
[1:01:59] god can't build us into that stature see
[1:02:03] he can't he can't make us up to that
[1:02:05] kind of a place we got all these
[1:02:09] other things
[1:02:10] we fall slight off with it he can't
[1:02:13] build his church
[1:02:15] paragraph 233 patience with what what
[1:02:18] kind of patience patience with your wife
[1:02:20] and your kid
[1:02:22] first things have patience with god
[1:02:25] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:02:28] have real genuine patience because faith
[1:02:31] worketh patience when god says anything
[1:02:34] you believe it that's all you got
[1:02:35] patience say well i asked him last night
[1:02:38] to heal me and i'm just as sick this
[1:02:40] morning oh my what patience
[1:02:43] god told abraham and 25 years later
[1:02:46] there wasn't even one sign he was still
[1:02:48] believing he was patient with god uh-huh
[1:02:51] put him always before you let him be the
[1:02:53] next crossing thing you can't cross him
[1:02:56] so just keep him before you he said so
[1:02:58] and it's going to happen
[1:02:59] keep him before you
[1:03:01] that's right let's go to the next quote
[1:03:05] oh look
[1:03:06] yeah
[1:03:08] noah had patience no had real godly
[1:03:10] patience
[1:03:12] what about 120 years you know we preach
[1:03:13] an hour and we think everybody ought to
[1:03:15] get it and we don't have a lot of
[1:03:16] patience
[1:03:17] noah preached the same message for 120
[1:03:19] years and only his family got it
[1:03:22] plenty of patience not even you fell
[1:03:24] from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty
[1:03:26] as it ever was for 120 years when he was
[1:03:28] patient then god tries your patience
[1:03:31] that's right god tries them remember he
[1:03:33] put noah in the ark shut the door and it
[1:03:35] was seven days before after that before
[1:03:37] he even started raining
[1:03:39] i mean he was locked in that ark with
[1:03:41] all those animals
[1:03:43] he had to have a lot of patience all
[1:03:44] right let's go to the next one
[1:03:46] number 13. statue of a perfect man
[1:03:50] and we should have patience with one
[1:03:52] another too
[1:03:53] one time we get so much we get so much
[1:03:56] impatient with one another's and we
[1:03:58] think we got to be like moses moses had
[1:04:00] patience with the people look that's
[1:04:02] what caused them not to go over
[1:04:05] remember moses what he done he he
[1:04:07] couldn't go over because remember he
[1:04:09] struck the rock instead of speaking to
[1:04:10] it he didn't have patience all right
[1:04:12] like i've tried to get this message over
[1:04:14] to tabernacle to see that each member of
[1:04:16] the tabernacle become this i believe
[1:04:18] he's pointing to that
[1:04:19] it's hard to do
[1:04:21] i've tried to have patience this is 33
[1:04:24] years say have patience women still bob
[1:04:27] the hair still just the same but just
[1:04:30] have patience see just have patience
[1:04:32] weight have to
[1:04:34] if you ain't got it don't try to build
[1:04:36] on this down here
[1:04:37] have patience all right let's go to the
[1:04:39] next one
[1:04:42] 14 is shalom
[1:04:44] 1964.
[1:04:47] some people say but brother branham i've
[1:04:49] tried and i've tried but wait a minute
[1:04:51] patience is virtue
[1:04:54] patience is holy spirit virtue now this
[1:04:56] is a year or more after he preached the
[1:04:57] statute of perfect man he's building on
[1:04:59] something here they that wait upon the
[1:05:01] lord shall renew the same strength you
[1:05:03] say how can i wait any longer just keep
[1:05:06] on waiting when you've done all you can
[1:05:08] do to stand then stand see just stand
[1:05:12] how am i going to do it stand
[1:05:14] look he said it's the truth
[1:05:17] and it's the truth
[1:05:19] he said it'll happen how i don't know
[1:05:23] that's our problem we'll try to figure
[1:05:24] out how god's going to do it
[1:05:27] now god didn't get put us here to figure
[1:05:28] it out
[1:05:30] just believe that happened he said so he
[1:05:33] promised it if he promised it it's going
[1:05:35] to happen that's all it can't waste in
[1:05:38] other words god can't have one thought
[1:05:40] like we're talking about and then turn
[1:05:41] around and say no i don't want that one
[1:05:42] i want to do another one no
[1:05:44] his thoughts are eternal
[1:05:47] all right let's go to the next one
[1:05:48] number 15.
[1:05:50] this is the thytaran church age church
[1:05:52] age book
[1:05:54] i like this one
[1:05:56] the scripture says i know your faith now
[1:05:58] he does not say here as he did to the
[1:05:59] church in pergamus you hold my faith
[1:06:02] he's not talking about his faith now but
[1:06:03] he's commending them for their
[1:06:05] faithfulness
[1:06:06] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:06:09] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:06:12] go together
[1:06:13] all right in fact patience is the
[1:06:16] outcome of faithfulness
[1:06:19] for it says in james 1 3 the trying of
[1:06:21] your faith worketh patience there is
[1:06:23] absolutely no other way in which to gain
[1:06:27] patience it has to come by the trial
[1:06:30] of our faith so that's what we're facing
[1:06:33] it's got to come to that romans 5 3 says
[1:06:35] tribulation work is patience how highly
[1:06:38] god regards this outworking of our
[1:06:40] patients as seen in james 1 4 but let
[1:06:43] patients have her perfect work that you
[1:06:45] may be perfect and entire lacking
[1:06:48] nothing boy look if we get up here and
[1:06:50] he's talking about lacking nothing god's
[1:06:52] will it for us is perfection
[1:06:56] and that perfection is patience
[1:06:59] waiting on god and waiting for god
[1:07:03] look read that right there
[1:07:05] this is the process of character
[1:07:07] development amen
[1:07:09] how highly god has commended these
[1:07:11] saints
[1:07:12] of the dark ages you know of course that
[1:07:14] was a dark age that had patience but
[1:07:16] patience first thing you have what
[1:07:17] patience with god
[1:07:19] the problem is we go god when i don't
[1:07:21] see anything
[1:07:23] do we see to believe or do we believe to
[1:07:25] see
[1:07:26] i think we're supposed to believe and
[1:07:27] then that triggers something called
[1:07:29] faith and then we see it all right
[1:07:30] instead of one because remember if i see
[1:07:33] hannah on the front row worshiping god i
[1:07:35] don't have to have faith that she's
[1:07:36] going to get saved
[1:07:38] same way with any of us that's see to us
[1:07:40] that's too easy
[1:07:42] that's easy for us to say wow my
[1:07:44] children there they are no
[1:07:47] you've got to pray for him
[1:07:49] pray for him
[1:07:50] pray for him not look at the
[1:07:53] circumstances abraham didn't look at his
[1:07:55] circumstances abraham was not i don't
[1:07:58] believe abraham was worried especially
[1:08:00] at the very end because he come to the
[1:08:01] place where he couldn't do anything
[1:08:04] you know he could try to help god at
[1:08:05] first he could produce a little bit but
[1:08:07] when you got down to him 99 or 100 years
[1:08:09] old he's dead
[1:08:12] i think he said one day finally he just
[1:08:14] said hey
[1:08:15] god if you're going to do it you're
[1:08:17] going to have to do it because i can't
[1:08:18] do it myself god said i've been wanting
[1:08:20] you for 25 years to say that but now
[1:08:22] that you've said it i'll send you
[1:08:24] somebody
[1:08:25] named elohim
[1:08:27] in human flesh and i'll let him tell you
[1:08:29] what's going to happen because remember
[1:08:31] he didn't tell god didn't tell him at
[1:08:32] the first of the journey right that he
[1:08:34] was going to have the baby through sarah
[1:08:36] he just said you're going to be a father
[1:08:38] of nations
[1:08:39] this is what you're going to do we'll
[1:08:41] see in the development of his in the
[1:08:43] development of his journey it come to a
[1:08:46] place to where
[1:08:48] god said okay
[1:08:50] i'm going to do it through sarah same
[1:08:52] way with god now god come down through
[1:08:54] seven church ages and he said i'm gonna
[1:08:56] have a bride but at one day i'm gonna
[1:08:58] have a bride that's gonna take a body
[1:08:59] change
[1:09:00] one day i'm gonna have a bride not
[1:09:02] different from the others but yet also a
[1:09:04] little bit more up higher a little bit
[1:09:07] i'm going to send them a prophet where
[1:09:08] now they cannot just read i mean how
[1:09:11] many times do you read
[1:09:12] second peter when you
[1:09:14] right even not in the message i mean you
[1:09:16] know if you just was a nominal christian
[1:09:17] you read sure it's been in the bible for
[1:09:19] 2000 years
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] but how about applying it to you and
[1:09:24] then it be a requirement and then as
[1:09:26] that requirement comes
[1:09:29] you see your life being brought up in
[1:09:30] god
[1:09:31] that didn't happen in the denomination
[1:09:33] world
[1:09:35] they really don't know how to live it
[1:09:36] without the holy ghost you can't live it
[1:09:38] it's just it's just like they said it's
[1:09:40] alcohol it's anonymous it's just
[1:09:41] suppressing a feeling you know it's
[1:09:43] trying to get trying to get people to
[1:09:44] come to church and then they started
[1:09:46] going well we can't get anybody's church
[1:09:48] so now they can come as they want to you
[1:09:49] know see them big scientists come as you
[1:09:51] are
[1:09:53] well i don't mind you can come as you
[1:09:55] are here
[1:09:57] but just don't leave as you are
[1:10:03] one more time
[1:10:05] you can come as you are but don't leave
[1:10:08] as you are or actually don't leave as
[1:10:10] you were
[1:10:12] because remember this is a life-changing
[1:10:14] operation here this is not this is not
[1:10:17] something we try to
[1:10:18] a good thought or a suppression of our
[1:10:21] feelings and we need to we need you know
[1:10:23] we have set like you be like a monk
[1:10:26] yeah you know and that's okay if they
[1:10:27] want to do that but god didn't call us
[1:10:29] to be monks
[1:10:31] he didn't call us to be to where we
[1:10:33] didn't have a wife and and all the
[1:10:35] things like the catholic church says he
[1:10:36] called us to be full
[1:10:38] have a full christian life right
[1:10:40] children wife kids
[1:10:43] listen god knew you was gonna have
[1:10:44] problems with your kids way before you
[1:10:46] did right
[1:10:49] but my question is
[1:10:51] did he equip you for the job
[1:10:54] i believe he did
[1:10:55] he didn't just make you a parent he made
[1:10:58] you a holy ghost-filled parent
[1:11:00] my problem was in bringing my kids up is
[1:11:03] i didn't have the holy ghost
[1:11:05] so what kind of virtue could they draw
[1:11:06] from that and that's my problem
[1:11:09] what about you and i what about all of
[1:11:11] us
[1:11:12] all of us we could but we can't go back
[1:11:14] because you know what god didn't go
[1:11:17] well i knew you weren't going to do that
[1:11:19] so i should have told you before no
[1:11:21] it was a journey you had to go through
[1:11:23] it was a process you had to go through
[1:11:26] to have some virtue faith that you can
[1:11:28] pass it how many how the world are you
[1:11:29] going to pass it to your kids if you
[1:11:30] don't have it right
[1:11:32] right you got to have it first how are
[1:11:34] you going to pass it to your neighbor if
[1:11:35] you don't have it first
[1:11:37] how you going to present it to somebody
[1:11:39] if you don't have it first brother adam
[1:11:40] even says when he comes up to the to the
[1:11:42] great seals he said if if god doesn't
[1:11:44] come on the scene we're only presuming
[1:11:46] well my the man had
[1:11:48] sick healed dead raised the opening of
[1:11:50] the word to a partial amount
[1:11:52] right then he comes up to the seals and
[1:11:55] says we're only presuming if god don't
[1:11:57] come and do this
[1:11:58] presuming you know what presuming is
[1:12:00] venturing without authority i believe in
[1:12:02] the statue of a perfect man but see
[1:12:04] brother branham had to grow
[1:12:05] amen he had to grow in all these
[1:12:08] and then god god told him right there
[1:12:10] and on sunset mountain now he may not
[1:12:13] have told him
[1:12:14] told him
[1:12:16] but he was positionally placed
[1:12:18] to do a job
[1:12:20] now listen that wasn't all for brother
[1:12:22] branham i like what that brother said
[1:12:24] one time he said
[1:12:25] i think it was brother harris he said
[1:12:27] now you got to have a sword in the hand
[1:12:29] experience
[1:12:30] you've got to have a
[1:12:32] mount
[1:12:33] whatever experience you it's got to be
[1:12:34] you can't say well brother branham got
[1:12:36] the sword in the hand and he was the
[1:12:37] only one that had the word i don't
[1:12:38] believe that
[1:12:41] did he put that sword back in his sheath
[1:12:43] and take it with him
[1:12:44] no he passed it down remember he said
[1:12:46] i've preached a word break it down and
[1:12:49] he said i give it to the preachers and
[1:12:50] they break it down in little nuggets and
[1:12:52] give it to the people you remember what
[1:12:53] jesus did jesus did never passed out one
[1:12:56] slice of bread
[1:12:58] jesus never passed out one fish
[1:13:02] he just multiplied the word and his what
[1:13:05] preachers
[1:13:07] give the fish and the loaves to the
[1:13:09] people don't you think you need a
[1:13:10] five-fold ministry absolutely you need a
[1:13:12] five-fold ministry if you don't then
[1:13:14] we're not perfected let's stand
[1:13:17] musicians come
[1:13:19] patience number one patience with god
[1:13:23] we've had 50 years and you know why
[1:13:25] god's let it go 50 years
[1:13:27] to try our patience
[1:13:30] he just said right there
[1:13:31] god's going to try your patience listen
[1:13:34] don't worry about your neighbor or your

[1:23:46] things in our little note pads
[1:23:48] and our little computer notepads why
[1:23:50] don't you put that in there
[1:23:53] and pray for her during that time
[1:23:56] well because they were too talked about
[1:23:57] had to go for colonoscopies
[1:24:00] i'm gonna ask i am asking the lord
[1:24:03] and we'll testify to them i had one two
[1:24:05] weeks ago
[1:24:07] they found no polyps
[1:24:09] no cancer and only a little bit of
[1:24:12] dive
[1:24:13] diverticulitis and they said that was
[1:24:15] normal for my age sure
[1:24:17] praise god for that and i'm looking for
[1:24:19] my brothers come back
[1:24:21] that's right amen
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:26] he never left the healing business and
[1:24:28] he don't ever close his door it's he's
[1:24:30] he's got an open sign on all the time
[1:24:33] and it's all
[1:24:34] it's all because we believe we got to
[1:24:37] believe he's already done it he's got to
[1:24:39] believe he's already done it so you love
[1:24:40] the lord pray for each one pray for each
[1:24:43] pray for each person pray for all
[1:24:46] like brother donny said that
[1:24:48] when you don't hear the musicians
[1:24:53] well it's not
[1:24:55] it is good but it's not
[1:24:57] it's wonderful to hear your voices come
[1:24:58] up because a lot of times you know
[1:25:01] a lot of times you can you can hear this
[1:25:03] musicians before you can hear the
[1:25:06] the voice but you know what this is
[1:25:08] going to be the quietest place we'll
[1:25:09] ever be in
[1:25:10] when we get over there see it's not
[1:25:12] going to matter how much that we shout
[1:25:14] because we're not going to have a voice
[1:25:15] that goes away
[1:25:17] we'll be able to shout the victory but
[1:25:19] what a great thing to know though that
[1:25:20] god has given us something to me we let
[1:25:23] me talk tell us one more time you talk
[1:25:25] about brother brown we're talking about
[1:25:26] our emotions
[1:25:28] to me this what this is what calms our
[1:25:30] emotions
[1:25:31] the statue of a perfect man calms your
[1:25:33] emotions because when you first get born
[1:25:34] again there's a lot of things god does
[1:25:36] for you but then if you go through some
[1:25:38] kind of little trial you just everything
[1:25:39] goes haywire
[1:25:41] but when you but when you go on through
[1:25:43] a little bit higher up there to patients
[1:25:46] that say
[1:25:47] the reason you know you're growing is is
[1:25:48] you get you have those experiences and
[1:25:50] nobody knows them but you
[1:25:52] and how you really react to them you had
[1:25:54] that experience down here but you know
[1:25:56] several years later as you grew in the
[1:25:58] word maybe that same experience will
[1:26:00] come by and and you reacted a totally
[1:26:02] different way to it
[1:26:04] see that means you're growing that means
[1:26:06] that god has he he showed you this one
[1:26:08] that you failed
[1:26:09] he's going to show you this one that you
[1:26:11] won
[1:26:12] all right so you got to go through it
[1:26:15] you got to go through it because
[1:26:16] remember the remember the scripture says
[1:26:18] after you've done the will of god
[1:26:21] you've got to do the will of god first
[1:26:22] when you do the will of god then all
[1:26:24] these other things will open up to you
[1:26:26] you love the lord
[1:26:28] pray for each and every one bless you
[1:26:30] be careful on the way home let's pray
[1:26:32] heavenly father we pray lord today that
[1:26:37] that you'll take what's been said and
[1:26:40] and let us all chew on it lord let us

[1:26:45] become part of us
[1:26:47] father give us patience give us
[1:26:48] temperance lord and all the things that
[1:26:50] we're speaking of lord may it become
[1:26:53] well in our soul and not just be

[1:27:41] even controls
[1:27:43] it controlled the human body when you

[1:27:48] one father we pray for
[1:27:50] each one lord that's like said that's
[1:27:52] not with us that's sick we pray it
[1:27:53] should be with them the ones that are on
[1:27:55] the internet listening in lord may they
[1:27:57] receive an anointing that they can't
[1:27:59] contain father and truly may it be well
[1:28:01] with our soul forgive us of our sins and
[1:28:03] our many mistakes that we make lord we
[1:28:05] actually just be with us now till we
[1:28:07] come back wednesday in service to you in
