[36:02] june they're traveling back this evening
[36:05] and just have your way with each one now
[36:07] we committed to you now in jesus name
[36:10] amen amen amen
[36:13] revelations 1.
[36:18] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[36:21] gave unto him to humanity's servants
[36:23] things which must shortly come to pass
[36:26] and he said and signified it by his
[36:28] angel unto his servant john
[36:30] who by record of the word of god and on
[36:32] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[36:35] things that he saw
[36:37] blessed is he that readeth with about a
[36:39] blessing just to read
[36:41] and they they hear the words of this
[36:42] prophecy
[36:44] because that means that you if you
[36:45] couldn't read
[36:47] somebody can read it to you
[36:49] right so it's a blessing just to hear it
[36:51] right
[36:52] keep those things which are written
[36:53] therein for the time is at hand okay
[36:57] matthew 24
[37:00] jesus went out and departed from the
[37:02] temple
[37:03] and his disciples came to him for to
[37:05] shoot him the buildings of the temple
[37:09] jesus said unto them
[37:11] seek out all these things verily i say
[37:13] unto you
[37:15] there shall not be left one stone here
[37:17] upon another that shall not be thrown
[37:19] down
[37:20] and he set up on the mount of olives the
[37:22] disciples came into him privately saying
[37:25] tell us when shall these things be what
[37:28] if there will be one stone left on
[37:29] another then they went on the end of the
[37:31] questions right
[37:33] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[37:35] because they knew he had spoke of his
[37:37] coming
[37:38] uh constantly right his second coming
[37:41] right
[37:42] and
[37:44] of the end
[37:45] of the world you may be seated the lord
[37:47] at his blessing
[37:49] reading of the word because we know the
[37:50] ending of the world
[37:52] is this
[37:53] sick seal
[37:56] it will end the world because
[37:59] you know time will come to a close
[38:02] and things will be over
[38:04] and then it'll be finished
[38:06] so now we're having questions and
[38:08] answers
[38:10] and i've got one i want to take it first
[38:13] and then if you have anything
[38:15] uh on your heart any comments and things
[38:18] feel free to do so
[38:21] as we continue along
[38:24] and uh
[38:26] the one the one question that was given
[38:28] me at lunchtime says
[38:31] can you go over why dan and ephraim are
[38:34] bought brought back in
[38:37] the millennium
[38:38] millennium you know the right millennial
[38:40] rank
[38:41] said did
[38:43] the removal only apply to earthly
[38:47] dealings and since the 24 000 are purged
[38:51] then they can be they can take
[38:54] their place among the tribes
[38:57] all right now
[38:58] we covered dan and ephraim
[39:00] how that
[39:02] when you we went back into tribes so
[39:04] we'll take a fight run through
[39:07] we went back into the uh the dealings
[39:10] with it under the sixth seal
[39:12] and uh
[39:14] dealing with 144 000 and found that they
[39:17] were 12 tribes listed there in
[39:20] revelations 7
[39:22] and in those 12 tribes
[39:24] there's one of
[39:26] um
[39:27] jacob had 12
[39:29] children
[39:30] all right we named each one and brought
[39:32] it down
[39:33] and uh
[39:34] then when we get over here to
[39:37] uh revelation 7
[39:39] you find out that dan is missing
[39:43] out of the the writings there in
[39:46] revelation 7
[39:48] and then you know brother adam when he
[39:50] was referring to it he said see dan and
[39:51] ephraim are missing
[39:53] here in revelation 7
[39:56] and and that's true because
[39:58] the ephraim was um
[40:02] not a
[40:03] son of jacob
[40:04] he's the son of joseph
[40:06] all right so then the original was to
[40:09] have been we went through the whole
[40:10] series of going
[40:12] and covering that uh there was original
[40:16] in god to have been 12 you know 13
[40:18] tribes 12
[40:20] of them circling around for the camps
[40:22] etc and then the levite would have been
[40:25] in the midst
[40:27] and joseph never was to have had a tribe
[40:30] the prophet said
[40:31] named after him
[40:33] it was to been you know doing because
[40:35] you're dealing back
[40:37] in the part of genesis you're dealing
[40:38] with the the sons of
[40:41] jacob then you started dealing with the
[40:44] tribes
[40:45] and we tried to emphasize that a little
[40:47] that we went along seeing once you
[40:49] started
[40:50] um it even is not listed as tribes when
[40:53] you would be coming out of egypt it
[40:56] would just be the children of israel but
[40:58] then they begin to camp and they begin
[41:00] to do
[41:01] and up and it began to pick up the word
[41:03] tribe
[41:04] and we see then that
[41:06] what happened was was
[41:08] joseph
[41:10] and levi were the two you know they were
[41:13] the children of jacob
[41:15] out of the twelve
[41:17] but what happened was that god was
[41:19] intended and i said who had 13 tribes
[41:22] so that would have worked out with levi
[41:24] being in the midst
[41:26] and there would be no uh inheritance no
[41:29] tribe would really to be named after him
[41:33] but yet it was uh done because of the
[41:35] fall all right then the levite would
[41:37] have been in the middle and the twelve
[41:39] tribes around which would have picked up
[41:41] uh ephraim and manasseh which were the
[41:43] two children of joseph
[41:46] and that was put in to make it 13. let's
[41:49] see then you say well that would have
[41:50] really made 14 but it would have but
[41:52] joseph wasn't and i said wasn't to have
[41:54] a tribe named after him because joseph
[41:57] would have been a perfect type of christ
[42:00] all right so then in the original you
[42:02] would wind up in the children of israel
[42:05] as they started their journey and they
[42:07] counted and they'd done things they had
[42:09] the 13 tribes listed
[42:12] the levite in the middle and that would
[42:14] have been the perfect order but dan and
[42:16] ephraim went after the golden calves not
[42:19] the time of the children of israel when
[42:21] when you know they came down and they
[42:22] made
[42:23] uh aaron made the guys because it's
[42:26] another incident but they went after
[42:28] that in worship and as they did
[42:31] their names were taken out not that they
[42:34] said it didn't blot out
[42:38] you know of their names of their tribes
[42:41] it's because it stated they would be
[42:44] blotted out under heaven
[42:46] but god didn't remove the tribes and
[42:48] leave them out they went right on being
[42:50] who they were
[42:51] and the prophet said that's where the
[42:53] trouble was because they thought they
[42:54] got by with it
[42:56] but it didn't see they went on over if
[42:58] you'll go read there where dan and
[43:00] ephraim went and they made the case
[43:01] you'll find them later coming back
[43:03] joining back together dividing ten
[43:06] tribes and two tribes and and all kind
[43:08] of incidences in
[43:10] the uh the writings of the gospel
[43:13] but when you come over to
[43:15] then to revelations you find
[43:18] that
[43:19] ephraim is and dan and ephraim being
[43:21] missing
[43:22] and you do you find joseph put back in
[43:26] and you find uh then the the uh
[43:30] let's see what you want to put back in
[43:32] joseph
[43:33] and manassas
[43:34] was put back in in revelation 7.
[43:37] all right and see it was taken out under
[43:39] heaven
[43:41] and that's a wonderful instead of god
[43:42] that we serve
[43:44] that even though those people went after
[43:46] those golden calves and the things that
[43:48] was made
[43:49] their names were not blotted out in
[43:51] heaven
[43:52] and to prove that it wasn't
[43:54] when you come over into ezekiel 48
[43:58] you'll find dan and ephraim
[44:01] put back in
[44:02] because ezekiel 48 is the millennial
[44:05] reign
[44:06] go back and read you daniel 70 weeks but
[44:08] around said uh ezekiel 40 to 44
[44:12] is the building of the millennial temple
[44:15] you know to be made
[44:17] all right then
[44:18] chapter 48 you get back to shoredom in
[44:20] perfect tribal order
[44:23] and that would wind up then being the 13
[44:26] tribes you know back right putting the
[44:29] the 12 with the danny from back in you
[44:32] don't take out manassas and things you
[44:34] leave it like it is but what you wind up
[44:37] doing is you have israel in the
[44:39] millennium
[44:41] and they are back in tribal order and it
[44:44] won't be camped out in tribal order
[44:47] count
[44:48] in the millennium it would just be a
[44:50] wonderful
[44:51] time
[44:52] and there won't be any uh
[44:54] uh worship or animal sacrifices in the
[44:57] millennium in the temple it's there as
[44:59] an example or to show
[45:01] that god keeps his word
[45:03] because he promised david
[45:06] that his son would sit on his throne
[45:09] all right we know that
[45:11] you know it happened that way
[45:14] in the natural
[45:16] but then when you come over into the
[45:19] part of the millennial reign it's a
[45:20] promise to the jews
[45:23] the millennium is to the jews it's not
[45:25] to we will be there as
[45:29] a honeymoon
[45:30] but not as people to
[45:33] do we can rule and reign there will be
[45:35] as we covered this morning
[45:36] a little bit and did the other day it
[45:39] will be the gospel to the even
[45:41] in the millennial reign but in the
[45:43] millennial
[45:45] dan and ephraim is put back in what
[45:47] about a great god
[45:50] that thanks so much of his people now
[45:53] that he would say i'm going to remove
[45:55] your name under earth
[45:57] because you've done wrong
[45:59] well but he said i'm going to put it
[46:01] back in
[46:02] well as i said now don't go try to study
[46:04] the bible and see if you could find dan
[46:07] and ephraim take it out
[46:09] you know
[46:10] that's
[46:11] what we said this morning thank god for
[46:14] a prophet
[46:15] you just read here and you find them you
[46:17] read over here and you find them gone
[46:20] and then you're left with the idea of
[46:22] what happened to them
[46:23] and you can't get it all balanced up it
[46:26] it takes you hours if you ever got done
[46:28] the other day
[46:30] and that you don't realize it you go try
[46:32] it sometime just go back and search it
[46:34] out
[46:34] and just try to keep up with them tribes
[46:36] and keep them straight
[46:38] you've really got a whole lot to deal
[46:40] with and you've got to just really write
[46:42] it down this one says this and says this
[46:45] this one says this this is it then you
[46:47] look at them the best way to do put them
[46:49] down this chapter says so and so this
[46:51] chapter says so and so you know because
[46:53] if you don't
[46:54] you're going to start juggling
[46:56] the tribes around and can't figure it
[46:58] out all right
[46:59] but dan and ephraim is put back in
[47:02] the
[47:03] and as they're put back in
[47:06] it's remember it's in heaven they come
[47:08] back because the millennium is
[47:12] the first heaven
[47:14] verse heaven is the millennium first
[47:16] earth is now remembered in scripture
[47:18] so while he was in earth he quit dealing
[47:20] with
[47:22] them but when you come back in
[47:25] to
[47:26] tribal order in the millennium because
[47:29] the millennium is to
[47:31] the jews
[47:32] it is the nation of israel
[47:34] in the millennium it's their
[47:37] promise
[47:38] it's their doings because that was what
[47:40] they were told it would have and they
[47:42] will have it because god keeps his word
[47:45] i like that i like to find where he's
[47:47] made a promise
[47:48] i remember reading it where he said he
[47:50] won't send the headstone on our marriage
[47:55] he said he'll send it because he
[47:56] promised it
[47:57] well you know the coming of the
[47:59] headstones are revealed in his word so
[48:01] they may know how goody goody we are
[48:04] right right you know we have special
[48:05] people boy look at us like i said this
[48:07] morning you get that head raised up that
[48:09] way you're gonna get slapped down that's
[48:11] right because that's what happened to
[48:13] the children of israel
[48:15] huh
[48:16] that uh
[48:17] it's hard sometimes to explain back
[48:19] there all right but they will be put
[48:21] back in tribal order
[48:23] and all because there's tribes remember
[48:27] dan and ephraim dan is a child of
[48:30] joseph but ephraim is a child of
[48:35] joseph if i get that right dennis is of
[48:38] jacob
[48:39] ephraim is of joseph
[48:42] so you don't don't get them confused and
[48:44] trying to calculate
[48:46] but then you say well why would brother
[48:48] branham when revelations
[48:50] seven just
[48:51] leaves ephraim leaves dan out
[48:55] well that was the reason he left that
[48:56] now
[48:58] manassas was put in the place of
[49:01] of damn
[49:03] and joseph placed back in season that
[49:05] would bring it back up because it was
[49:08] under heaven
[49:09] but in heaven it'll all be made right
[49:12] right
[49:12] you'll all be made right for me and you
[49:14] one of these days and everything will be
[49:16] over
[49:16] we'll be there with our children and
[49:18] with our offspring
[49:22] if they believe
[49:24] not just because they're our offspring
[49:28] but because they believe because we can
[49:30] talk to them about the word of god and
[49:32] get them to see god
[49:34] right for their own sales
[49:37] we don't deal with them then there's no
[49:39] gonna be no doing okay all right so that
[49:41] will be that one uh anybody else got any
[49:44] anybody got any comments
[49:46] any thoughts on the
[49:48] uh sister trudy said she
[49:51] wrote hers down and left him at home
[49:54] so uh
[49:55] richard where yeah
[49:57] i guess he's in the back back there
[50:03] probably get to
[50:06] which when you help you look
[50:11] you get your sister trudy
[50:15] she said she wrote down a bunch and then
[50:17] forgot him i said well maybe you can
[50:18] remember
[50:20] and write them down
[50:21] i'm like that too i
[50:24] i have to write down she ain't as old as
[50:27] i am yet
[50:30] right well my question was pertaining to
[50:33] um
[50:34] the redemption plan for the foolish
[50:36] virgin
[50:37] um
[50:38] now the food i just need to get more
[50:41] verification understanding now the food
[50:43] virgins would know they miss it until
[50:45] the bride leaves
[50:48] um
[50:50] and
[50:52] if that's the case then where will they
[50:54] go after they die and get their virgin
[50:58] where does the foolish virgin go
[51:00] after they die okay they will have to go
[51:03] into a position
[51:05] to be waiting
[51:07] all right
[51:08] now we'll get back to this in a little
[51:10] bit so i'll just say a word about it
[51:12] that we believe that when a person dies
[51:16] no matter who whether they're christians
[51:18] or saints
[51:20] you have a place to go to
[51:23] it would be called your theophany
[51:26] you can use the word theophany even as a
[51:28] word for
[51:29] uh
[51:31] unregenerated people
[51:33] because it's simply meaning your
[51:35] celestial form
[51:37] of your soul
[51:39] this the soul that goes on the body goes
[51:42] to the ground
[51:43] the spirit says go back to god who gave
[51:45] it we've got this in a minute to recover
[51:47] it
[51:48] but the soul goes to a place
[51:50] well then the foolish virgins when we
[51:53] leave out of here
[51:55] in a rapture
[51:56] the foolish virgins will have to give
[51:58] their life for the gospel in the
[52:00] tribulation
[52:02] that is their purging because of the
[52:04] rejecting of the real truth
[52:08] of the word of god and it will be the
[52:10] foolish virgins will be
[52:12] uh in each age brother brown said so
[52:15] it's not just in this end time age
[52:17] that it's done so they've done a lot of
[52:19] people's done died
[52:21] you know of the foolish virgins and they
[52:23] went to a place
[52:24] i can't put them in the fifth dimension
[52:27] because that would be the center dead
[52:29] and i wouldn't want to do that
[52:31] but i wouldn't want to put them in a
[52:33] position of
[52:35] of the uh the ones that's passed on you
[52:37] know up to where we're at you wouldn't
[52:39] want to put them into the bride position
[52:43] and see that all christians a prophet
[52:45] said
[52:46] we'll go to the six dimensions and he
[52:48] uses the word christians a lot of times
[52:51] as
[52:52] just people that are believers
[52:54] so i like that ray he said he said only
[52:58] the bride goes to the sixth dimension
[53:00] well then you'd have a problem trying to
[53:02] deal with where everybody else was at
[53:05] so we'll get back in a minute to this to
[53:08] cover evidently must be sections or
[53:10] whatever you want to call it i don't
[53:11] know i'm not educated enough to be able
[53:14] to express
[53:15] uh the point except that they must be
[53:19] groups because when brother random went
[53:21] beyond the curtain of time he didn't see
[53:23] paul and peter and them
[53:25] he only saw the people of his age now
[53:28] there's a question in here in a minute
[53:29] that'll very well help us to understand
[53:31] that
[53:32] but see to me that if when we die the
[53:34] foolish virgins will give their life
[53:37] they will have to go somewhere into a
[53:39] dimensional holding situation which
[53:41] would be the sixth dimension
[53:43] and then when they do
[53:45] then they will come forth in a
[53:48] resurrection
[53:50] after the millennial reign
[53:52] and will have to go forth to the white
[53:55] throne
[53:56] to be judged with everyone else
[53:58] because they will be after the
[54:00] millennial reign there will be a
[54:03] a a judgment
[54:05] of all mankind so you'll be brought up
[54:08] everybody will be brought up that's not
[54:09] already went up
[54:11] the brides already went up the other
[54:13] that we've dealt with the other day are
[54:15] already there and and done lived through
[54:18] the millennium and different things so
[54:20] there won't be a judgment for them
[54:22] but it'll be the judgment of the people
[54:24] like that like foolish virgins but it'll
[54:26] be people that are lost
[54:28] we'll have to come up as we recover
[54:30] this morning a little bit you know
[54:32] they'll come up and stand there
[54:35] and be judged as whether or not they can
[54:37] receive eternal life but there is an
[54:39] opportunity
[54:41] for the foolish virgins that are real
[54:43] true for this bullish virgin
[54:45] real true people as we call them right
[54:48] around them we call them christians
[54:50] he wouldn't say the baptist ain't a
[54:52] christian
[54:53] he'd say a believer
[54:55] he's a christian so he'd use the word
[54:57] christian so he said christians go to
[55:00] the sixth dimension
[55:02] well as i said then what are you going
[55:03] to do with them you would have to have
[55:05] um
[55:06] would you make a position or thing
[55:10] uh we're in a day of understanding a
[55:12] little better i guess of some of those
[55:14] things i don't think it's cubicles you
[55:16] know this group goes in here this group
[55:19] goes in there and they can't look over
[55:20] the wall and see the others on the other
[55:21] side i don't think like that
[55:24] i'm glad we're in a day
[55:26] when it has been proved by the computers
[55:29] that you can overlay
[55:33] right
[55:34] you can take a computer and you can just
[55:36] overlay things
[55:39] and you just keep you can and it doesn't
[55:41] mess up any of the dimensional
[55:44] parts of it you know you can put you
[55:46] something here and you can overlay it
[55:48] and you can do it again and you can
[55:49] overlay that and you can just keep
[55:51] overlaying it
[55:52] and eventually you'll have a completion
[55:55] look like you go to the doctor and he'll
[55:57] take he'll lay out this thing and show
[55:59] you and he'll say here's the body well
[56:01] it's you know
[56:03] and then he says well here you take this
[56:05] off and you can see so much
[56:07] and then you take off some more and you
[56:09] can see some more
[56:10] well i mean to me that's just the best
[56:12] way i can understand
[56:14] the dimensional situation of
[56:17] god putting us into a place
[56:20] to where that we will not be bothering
[56:23] each other
[56:25] are wondering about each other we will
[56:27] be concerned about our group
[56:29] in where we're at
[56:30] is that what you're talking about dude
[56:32] yes and he did answer part of my next
[56:35] question because my next question was if
[56:37] they were to be in the sixth dimension
[56:39] well
[56:40] at that time the bride will be in the
[56:42] millennium so we wouldn't be in the
[56:44] sixth dimension right
[56:46] okay the only ones would be in the sixth
[56:48] dimension would be your foolish virgin
[56:50] form waiting
[56:52] to whether or not they could come forth
[56:54] and receive eternal life
[56:56] because the others that i've covered
[56:58] in the millennial reign
[57:00] you know
[57:01] your
[57:02] old testament sites i believe will be in
[57:04] the millennial right the real genuine
[57:06] true ones
[57:08] and you're 144 000 your two witnesses
[57:10] and your fifth fields you could all be
[57:12] in the millennial right
[57:14] so that would live only in the sixth
[57:16] dimension
[57:17] the souls of those that would be known
[57:20] as the foolish virgins because those
[57:22] that are not going to be given eternal
[57:24] life
[57:26] we'd be in the fifth dimension
[57:29] right the souls of them would be in the
[57:32] fifth dimension waiting for a judgment
[57:34] and things like that you say well
[57:36] they're in hell that was that's a
[57:37] dimensional
[57:39] hell's not burning right now
[57:43] he said it's just a falling
[57:46] he said a burning hell would actually be
[57:47] good
[57:50] that's not what you don't mind
[57:51] yes thank you
[57:55] she said she had a page full i i like to
[57:57] get you know sometimes i get
[58:00] sister barbara she'll write me a 10 page
[58:02] letter you know
[58:04] and talking about what she believes and
[58:06] sister johnny will do that every once in
[58:08] a while and
[58:09] she used to give me a whole book
[58:12] and you know i enjoy reading of your
[58:15] thoughts and your testimonies
[58:17] because it helps me
[58:19] it helps me to see where you're at and
[58:21] what your understanding is
[58:23] but it helps me because sometimes i
[58:25] really say hey you know
[58:27] they corrected me right there just a
[58:29] little bit maybe i've leaning too far
[58:30] you know and i loved it i love to read
[58:33] your
[58:34] comments i love to hear what you have to
[58:36] say
[58:38] because we're all together as a
[58:39] christians
[58:41] this is not a lord over me pastor you
[58:43] know
[58:44] that you can't have your thoughts
[58:46] and like i've always said if you differ
[58:48] with me
[58:49] i'd he'd rather you tell me
[58:52] let me go tell somebody else
[58:55] i don't think you have a right to tell
[58:56] anybody else until you tell me first
[59:00] because that would be derogatory it
[59:03] wouldn't work out all right who'll be
[59:04] next
[59:06] you met sister
[59:17] a regina of simple questions from there
[59:20] um you said this a few times but duh on
[59:23] me
[59:24] um the five groups i'll tell you the
[59:27] four that i have and you just fill in
[59:28] the blank
[59:29] old testament saints 144 whose virgins
[59:33] and fist seal jews who am i missing
[59:37] are you missing the bride from one stop
[59:39] to madness
[59:50] you've got to deal with the uh
[59:52] the
[59:53] um
[59:54] gospel to the heathen you know in the
[59:56] millennium
[59:57] so you actually have six when you come
[59:59] down to it
[1:00:00] so it's okay
[1:00:02] okay
[1:00:05] our sister just missed herself
[1:00:08] she's trying to figure out where
[1:00:09] everybody else is laughing
[1:00:12] i understand that but
[1:00:14] let's do it anything else
[1:00:16] yeah um
[1:00:19] you've said this on many occasions over
[1:00:21] the years about um
[1:00:24] sharing the word with someone
[1:00:27] and i think i have the answer but i just
[1:00:29] want you to clarify for me when you say
[1:00:31] that i cringe because i'm
[1:00:33] a quiet person so and i know you've said
[1:00:35] before too that our lives
[1:00:38] speak for it as well right will that be
[1:00:40] considered as you know if you're
[1:00:42] applying first it sure will
[1:00:44] if you if you don't talk but yet you
[1:00:47] live the life
[1:00:49] it can be an example
[1:00:52] unto those around you
[1:00:54] that's the point that i've always
[1:00:56] believed you know
[1:00:57] but ron said your life is so loud i
[1:00:59] can't hear your words
[1:01:01] huh
[1:01:02] say meaning that you're not living
[1:01:04] according to your testimony will you and
[1:01:05] your people that are are really
[1:01:07] talkative
[1:01:09] it really will go out and no they're
[1:01:11] they're on fire
[1:01:12] but then you see them sneak around and
[1:01:14] do little things that's not correct
[1:01:16] we'll see people are watching you
[1:01:19] you know they can see you doing that
[1:01:23] and they say
[1:01:24] i don't want any part of that
[1:01:26] i've always been honest with what i try
[1:01:28] to say to you because i've always been
[1:01:31] people that tried to convert me you've
[1:01:32] heard me say to the lord when i was a
[1:01:35] sinner i told him i said i'll live a
[1:01:37] better life than your deepest board
[1:01:38] lives
[1:01:40] and i did because i could call attention
[1:01:41] to some of their
[1:01:43] problems
[1:01:44] well their life was so loud i couldn't
[1:01:46] see anything they were talking about
[1:01:48] i didn't want what they had if that's
[1:01:50] all they was gonna give
[1:01:52] and i had to get over that
[1:01:54] to a word that i could actually come to
[1:01:56] the lord
[1:01:57] you know
[1:01:58] and see it correctly
[1:02:00] so then just go ahead
[1:02:02] i'm not one you can go with me there's a
[1:02:04] lot of you here that have been with me
[1:02:06] hunting you've been with me there uh uh
[1:02:08] maybe one day i'm very talkative
[1:02:11] and and uh talking about the word but
[1:02:14] the next day i'm real quiet or something
[1:02:16] it's just i'm not like everybody else
[1:02:18] and you know you sit down and you say
[1:02:21] well you meet in a group
[1:02:23] and and sometimes i'll say something
[1:02:24] sometimes i won't because that's just
[1:02:27] that's just part of my nature ways i'm
[1:02:29] i'm more of a quiet person
[1:02:31] until i come here i know you're going to
[1:02:33] differ with me
[1:02:35] you know i'm more quiet
[1:02:37] and i'm in a very observative
[1:02:42] about what's being done
[1:02:45] anything else no thank you okay
[1:02:48] all right we'll be next
[1:02:52] we'll have comments questions
[1:02:54] talks
[1:03:02] and remember now
[1:03:04] i've never considered the per a question
[1:03:07] to be simple or you know meaningless
[1:03:10] that's so so simple i don't want to ask
[1:03:13] it
[1:03:15] if it's a question what's the problem
[1:03:17] it's the question
[1:03:20] you'd say well brother dale what's the
[1:03:21] color of the first horse rider i'm not
[1:03:24] going to get up here
[1:03:25] boy you're in that if you've been
[1:03:27] coming to church all alone don't know
[1:03:28] the color first horse rider
[1:03:30] no i'm going to tell you it's why i do
[1:03:32] the best i can to make it
[1:03:34] sensible enough for you to understand it
[1:03:36] because any question is a question
[1:03:39] and if you've got a question on your
[1:03:40] mind then you won't rightly come to a
[1:03:42] position of of uh
[1:03:45] understanding with that question
[1:03:48] because that's the question that's
[1:03:49] blocking you
[1:03:50] so don't ever worry about asking a
[1:03:52] question and say it's too simple
[1:03:54] it may be the question some of the
[1:03:55] people in the building are needing
[1:03:58] let alone yourself
[1:04:00] anybody else
[1:04:09] on the 25th uh of november you were
[1:04:13] talking about the the first heaven
[1:04:15] um and i thought just jot it down real
[1:04:18] quick
[1:04:19] can you explain it the first heaven
[1:04:21] first heaven
[1:04:23] all right now the bible says that the
[1:04:24] first heaven
[1:04:26] in the first earth
[1:04:28] is passed away that's that's in isaiah
[1:04:30] thank you that isaiah
[1:04:32] where it says the first heaven the first
[1:04:34] earth has passed away all right
[1:04:36] now
[1:04:37] the prophet said the first earth is now
[1:04:41] and i'm looking at the book but i'm
[1:04:43] trying to call the name of it but anyhow
[1:04:45] i'll find it it's easy
[1:04:47] oh just running your computer first
[1:04:49] heaven and it'll come up
[1:04:51] all right these heavens of heavens and
[1:04:53] all like this out here that we talk
[1:04:55] about
[1:04:56] you know we talk about this much of it
[1:04:58] is called heaven and then up here's
[1:05:00] heaven and
[1:05:01] paul spoke of the heavens of heavens
[1:05:03] and then he was taken up into the third
[1:05:05] heaven
[1:05:06] but the prophet said the first
[1:05:08] heaven is the millennial right
[1:05:11] because that's when heaven ruled over
[1:05:14] earth
[1:05:16] and that's the reason it's called the
[1:05:17] first heaven heaven is ruling over earth
[1:05:19] there won't be any devil he's bound for
[1:05:22] the thousand years
[1:05:23] so it's he's
[1:05:25] you know it can rule there won't be any
[1:05:27] atmospheres or problems there won't be
[1:05:30] any things going wrong
[1:05:32] it'll all be
[1:05:34] a beautiful utopia in the millennium so
[1:05:36] it's called the first heaven
[1:05:39] you see then like i said now you can go
[1:05:41] into paul and say that it takes
[1:05:43] you know
[1:05:44] third heaven
[1:05:45] well brother random now he says on when
[1:05:48] he was beyond the curtain of time
[1:05:50] uh whether he was relating the two
[1:05:52] together that's up to him but he said i
[1:05:54] believe i went to the first heaven
[1:05:57] whereas paul went to the third heaven
[1:06:00] but he'd run around and go to the
[1:06:01] millennium i would have any trouble
[1:06:04] i wouldn't have any trouble to say
[1:06:06] that's fine
[1:06:07] um
[1:06:08] i'd rather stay with what he said sold
[1:06:10] under the altar
[1:06:12] because that was what the angels of the
[1:06:13] lord referred to in him when it's beyond
[1:06:16] the curtain of time but if you said well
[1:06:17] he went to the millennium i'm not going
[1:06:19] to argue that he didn't
[1:06:21] i'm just going to say well you know
[1:06:24] he just said soldier of the altar
[1:06:27] because there's so much to be dealt with
[1:06:28] when you try to answer the one part and
[1:06:31] another part opens
[1:06:32] it
[1:06:33] that keeps going in too
[1:06:35] and you know
[1:06:36] what about paul he said he went to the
[1:06:38] third heaven and said
[1:06:40] that he couldn't actually talk about the
[1:06:42] things
[1:06:43] that he saw
[1:06:45] well
[1:06:46] maybe one of these days we'll get to see
[1:06:48] what he saw
[1:06:49] you know we'll get to understand it
[1:06:51] because we'll be there
[1:06:52] it'd be a wonderful time all right then
[1:06:54] what you're doing
[1:06:56] yeah anybody else
[1:07:03] all right
[1:07:04] maybe you can talk to something as we go
[1:07:06] along because i got some
[1:07:07] some more or less
[1:07:09] questions relating to what we've been
[1:07:11] talking about
[1:07:13] but not to say well this is under seal
[1:07:15] number one or seal number two or seal
[1:07:16] number six or
[1:07:18] whatever
[1:07:19] it's relating to what i've been
[1:07:20] encouraging you to do
[1:07:23] and that is to study the seals to see
[1:07:26] what god is speaking to you
[1:07:30] maybe the lord willing will get into a
[1:07:31] little bit wednesday night
[1:07:33] of the seventh seal
[1:07:35] and i would ask you i've listened i
[1:07:37] don't know how many times this week and
[1:07:39] last week every time i'm in the woods
[1:07:41] hunting i'm mostly listening to the
[1:07:43] seventh seal
[1:07:44] over and over and over i would ask you
[1:07:47] to go through that
[1:07:49] but do like now because this is the
[1:07:50] notes for wednesday okay
[1:07:53] i've got that in my mind seeing it hard
[1:07:54] to keep from preaching
[1:07:56] it see i've encouraged you to
[1:07:59] take every seal and read it not to just
[1:08:02] we know what the symbols are
[1:08:05] we can take the symbol of the first one
[1:08:06] the second third fourth no symbol of the
[1:08:08] field no symbol of the six we get into
[1:08:11] the stuff like that but
[1:08:13] i'm wanting you and i to read the seal
[1:08:15] book to see what it's saying to you and
[1:08:17] i
[1:08:18] then when we come to the seventh seal
[1:08:22] i told you that this hindered me when i
[1:08:24] first came into message
[1:08:27] because i read through the seal book and
[1:08:29] i saw great wonderful things
[1:08:32] but i was reading symbols
[1:08:35] i was reading
[1:08:37] you know what a man had to say
[1:08:40] i was not looking to see what it was
[1:08:42] speaking to me
[1:08:44] i was looking to see what it was
[1:08:46] speaking to somebody else
[1:08:49] over there after we're out of here
[1:08:52] but then one day i began to realize hey
[1:08:56] when that prophet got to that seventh
[1:08:58] seal
[1:08:59] he just mentions a few words
[1:09:01] and all at once he starts talking about
[1:09:04] what's going on in his ministry
[1:09:07] he was right
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:10] you get in that seventh seal just go
[1:09:12] over and over and you'll see and do they
[1:09:14] say that it throwed me because
[1:09:17] i was thinking this man is not supposed
[1:09:18] to be building his own self up
[1:09:21] and seemingly
[1:09:22] that was all he was doing under the
[1:09:24] seventh seal
[1:09:26] you know
[1:09:28] but then
[1:09:29] i had to wait for about i don't know
[1:09:31] really how long
[1:09:32] i waited quite a few many years before i
[1:09:34] ever read seal book again
[1:09:36] and then i began to realize
[1:09:38] that i was missing it because i was
[1:09:40] missing what the seals were saying to me
[1:09:44] trying to think they were only talking
[1:09:45] to somebody else or about somebody else
[1:09:48] because i could quote you in the early
[1:09:51] days just as well as now that the bride
[1:09:53] goes up revelation 4 1 not single 1921
[1:09:57] and and say the seal does not even do
[1:09:59] the bride
[1:10:02] but the revelation of redemption is to
[1:10:04] the bride and the seals reveal the
[1:10:07] revelation of redemption
[1:10:10] then read the seventh seal or listen to
[1:10:12] it
[1:10:13] and you'll see brother adam is not
[1:10:14] talking about himself
[1:10:18] he's talking about what god is doing
[1:10:21] well i hope you do that forever see
[1:10:25] to take each and every one of them and
[1:10:26] study them from the point
[1:10:28] to see because like we went into the
[1:10:31] fifth seal
[1:10:33] and by going into the fifth seal i
[1:10:35] believe it helped us drastically to
[1:10:37] understand
[1:10:39] us as a being a person a soul
[1:10:42] yes
[1:10:44] and see
[1:10:45] even though that has nothing in
[1:10:47] relationship to because it's sold under
[1:10:50] the altar it's fifth still jew
[1:10:52] but yet we can see what that soul is to
[1:10:54] them see what it is to you and i that's
[1:10:56] right
[1:10:57] so then it's like i'm saying i didn't
[1:10:59] mean it i don't mean to say these
[1:11:01] questions here are not related they are
[1:11:03] coming from what we talk about
[1:11:07] and then by doing that then it's in the
[1:11:08] part of the seals and that's what we're
[1:11:10] catching on to the right flights all
[1:11:12] right now let's go into it and just try
[1:11:14] to pick up i've got quite a few
[1:11:17] and uh
[1:11:19] we'll see what we can get into if we
[1:11:21] have to have questions and answers from
[1:11:22] st
[1:11:23] all right well then
[1:11:25] i took a while ago i said i got noticed
[1:11:26] for wednesday i can prove i'm going dear
[1:11:29] honey
[1:11:31] i'm not just study for them
[1:11:35] but now listen here's the question
[1:11:38] does the soul
[1:11:41] go to the place
[1:11:44] of the revelation
[1:11:48] in other words the soul does it go to
[1:11:50] the place when it you know you pass away
[1:11:52] in other words you you go on a rapture
[1:11:54] or a passing away either way would be
[1:11:57] you know
[1:11:58] uh does it go to the place
[1:12:01] of the revelation i believe that that's
[1:12:03] what i've talked about a minute ago the
[1:12:05] overlay of that sixth dimension
[1:12:07] the position or whatever you'd want to
[1:12:10] call it sections
[1:12:12] uh groups of people
[1:12:14] when runaround went beyond the curtain
[1:12:15] of town he didn't go to the to the
[1:12:18] luther's people
[1:12:20] or wesley's people he didn't even go to
[1:12:22] the pentecostals
[1:12:24] he really went to his people
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] and see it would be the people of the
[1:12:30] revelation of the hour
[1:12:34] of where he was at and when we pass on
[1:12:36] see we go to where our revelation is
[1:12:40] and that could be bad or good
[1:12:42] because if we don't have a revelation
[1:12:46] we'll go to where we don't have one
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:49] we would go
[1:12:50] to
[1:12:52] the fifth dimensional
[1:12:53] sin or dead
[1:12:55] but if we have a true revelation of god
[1:12:58] then that is what's drawing us right
[1:13:03] pulling us
[1:13:05] to a position
[1:13:07] a place and you remember i went through
[1:13:09] and preaching about it quite a bit
[1:13:10] during the fifth seal
[1:13:12] that
[1:13:12] see when you come into the word
[1:13:15] and that word will establish your place
[1:13:18] to go to
[1:13:21] it will put you a place it will make a
[1:13:22] place jesus said i go to a better place
[1:13:25] for you
[1:13:27] and see then that way it's
[1:13:30] it's
[1:13:32] all christians will go under that sixth
[1:13:35] dimension
[1:13:37] you know christian people
[1:13:40] but what form would be under that
[1:13:42] until something happens and then we're
[1:13:44] raised whatever
[1:13:46] but it would be the revelation those
[1:13:48] feel sealed jew
[1:13:52] they don't have the revelation of jesus
[1:13:54] christ correct that's right but it says
[1:13:56] for the testimony of the hell
[1:14:01] the testimony they held
[1:14:04] they were jews
[1:14:06] they were god's chosen people
[1:14:11] true
[1:14:14] sure they had turned down the messiah
[1:14:15] because
[1:14:16] that was had to be done where you and i
[1:14:18] could come in yes but still
[1:14:21] when their death came it gave them a
[1:14:24] place
[1:14:25] to go to
[1:14:27] so then truly that's a great statement
[1:14:29] that when your soul when you die or
[1:14:32] whatever or if we're changing we're
[1:14:34] going
[1:14:36] to another
[1:14:37] dimension or whatever you want to call
[1:14:38] it and it'll be because of our
[1:14:40] revelation yes right
[1:14:43] so that way luther would be in one place
[1:14:45] and wesley would be in another
[1:14:47] because of the difference in the
[1:14:49] revelation and the hour they were living
[1:14:51] so the pentecostals would be in another
[1:14:53] and see brother brownson said didn't go
[1:14:55] to the pentecostals
[1:14:57] he said this is your people right
[1:14:59] let's say this is azusa street you know
[1:15:02] the pentecostal because he was not the
[1:15:04] messenger to jesus christ
[1:15:07] he's a messenger to the bride of christ
[1:15:09] in the end time
[1:15:10] so then he would go to where his
[1:15:12] revelation was and the people with earth
[1:15:14] would be on that revelation because they
[1:15:16] said you know he said well paul and him
[1:15:18] have to be judged and
[1:15:19] he said yes he said
[1:15:22] well then i preached just what paul
[1:15:23] preached and he said the saints there
[1:15:25] you know
[1:15:26] they rallied around that point right
[1:15:30] of his message
[1:15:32] if you hadn't come they said
[1:15:34] all right
[1:15:36] now if anybody has any comments as i go
[1:15:37] along raise your hand we'll we'll go
[1:15:39] from that point
[1:15:40] but i'll try not to spend that so much
[1:15:42] time that we don't have time to get
[1:15:44] through
[1:15:47] so truly then your revelation
[1:15:49] provides you a place to go to right
[1:15:53] next question
[1:15:55] if the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:16:00] how can that be separated at death
[1:16:04] if the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:16:08] how can they be separated at death all
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:11] now according to brother branham
[1:16:14] what we follow
[1:16:15] if you die
[1:16:17] he said your body goes to the grave
[1:16:20] your spirit goes back to god who gave it
[1:16:23] and says
[1:16:24] your soul goes under the altar or goes
[1:16:27] to
[1:16:27] another dimension
[1:16:29] you know a place
[1:16:31] right so then it will divide just as the
[1:16:33] bible says
[1:16:35] that the
[1:16:36] opening of the word
[1:16:38] will discern between the body the spirit
[1:16:41] and the soul
[1:16:43] the other words to tell us about it
[1:16:45] so we're a unique
[1:16:48] of body spirit and soul
[1:16:50] without all of that being together we're
[1:16:52] not a person
[1:16:54] and we're not a person without a body
[1:16:56] spirit and soul
[1:16:58] he said well yeah there's a person yeah
[1:16:59] that's a soul that's the main you
[1:17:01] because that's a division that has taken
[1:17:03] place
[1:17:04] upon death
[1:17:06] upon death we must be separated
[1:17:09] from that union our unity
[1:17:12] that we would have as a being
[1:17:14] standing on earth like this
[1:17:17] so because this is going one way it
[1:17:19] can't go with me
[1:17:21] that's right
[1:17:22] but around them didn't see beyond the
[1:17:24] curtain of time
[1:17:25] bodies of the people that lived upon
[1:17:27] earth
[1:17:28] he saw their theophany
[1:17:31] all right
[1:17:32] see then that way your body would be
[1:17:34] down here your spirit would be and i
[1:17:36] can't explain that scripture because
[1:17:38] i've been through it many times where it
[1:17:40] says in your spirit goes back to god who
[1:17:42] gave really that's talking about him
[1:17:46] now first off
[1:17:47] it's really talking about jesus christ
[1:17:49] that when he died
[1:17:50] that his spirit went back to god and
[1:17:51] gave it that's really the text thought
[1:17:54] of it but what happens to you and i
[1:17:59] the spirit couldn't of a sinner couldn't
[1:18:01] go back into the presence of god
[1:18:04] and
[1:18:05] be with him
[1:18:07] but there's no place of saying
[1:18:10] you know a place for spirits to be put
[1:18:13] so we're dealing with something that a
[1:18:15] way that's
[1:18:16] i consider to be
[1:18:18] unanswerable
[1:18:20] so there's not a use of dealing with it
[1:18:22] you know on that basis of where it would
[1:18:24] go
[1:18:25] it don't get you
[1:18:27] the word it would go to a
[1:18:30] it can't reattach to god
[1:18:32] if it's a sinner
[1:18:36] and even the best we can do with our
[1:18:38] spirits today
[1:18:41] i'm just honestly not going to be about
[1:18:43] it
[1:18:44] the best christian in the world
[1:18:47] brother brown's spirit the best that he
[1:18:49] could be
[1:18:50] would not go back to god as that way of
[1:18:53] going
[1:18:58] it would it's just to me it's a
[1:19:00] statement
[1:19:02] of understanding
[1:19:04] uh
[1:19:05] what happens
[1:19:07] and i said the main point is that it's
[1:19:09] talking about
[1:19:11] jesus christ when he died because his
[1:19:12] spirit couldn't go back to god
[1:19:14] his spirit was not perverted
[1:19:17] right but the best we can do our spirit
[1:19:20] is perverted
[1:19:22] that's why we have to have
[1:19:25] a change in the body
[1:19:27] and not a change of the getting another
[1:19:29] spirit
[1:19:31] but we need to be working on this one
[1:19:32] brother
[1:19:40] i don't really know how to say things
[1:19:42] but hey but anyhow i had to talk a lot
[1:19:44] and i had discussed with around a lot
[1:19:47] and
[1:19:48] and
[1:19:48] i was discussing with a person and it
[1:19:51] was
[1:19:52] uh
[1:19:54] when uh and he came up this morning
[1:19:56] about about
[1:19:58] the woman preacher thing
[1:20:00] and uh there's a spirit ghost with that
[1:20:04] is that the woman can can be telling you
[1:20:07] the very truth of what's going on
[1:20:10] and because because your spirit or your
[1:20:13] nature
[1:20:14] is not in the correct position
[1:20:18] that thing that she's a woman telling
[1:20:20] you
[1:20:21] it blinds you
[1:20:23] you understand what don't mean
[1:20:26] and a lot of times when you say
[1:20:27] something about
[1:20:28] about brother brown you don't say it
[1:20:31] just like he said it or verbatim i
[1:20:33] believe that everything that i have
[1:20:35] don't come from
[1:20:37] the message of the hour i honestly
[1:20:39] believe that you know
[1:20:41] and of course that's personal to me
[1:20:43] see
[1:20:44] and what you thought about see
[1:20:46] to me
[1:20:48] to me when your soul
[1:20:50] leaves your body your body leaves you
[1:20:52] your spirit leaves your body your body's
[1:20:55] dead it lays down on the ground it can
[1:20:58] it can't i deal with people a lot of
[1:21:00] times you know they won't
[1:21:01] and brother brown calls this pest house
[1:21:05] but you know the lord jesus christ can't
[1:21:07] manifest himself without this pestilence
[1:21:11] he can't do it
[1:21:12] see but the only way he can do it with
[1:21:15] this pass out that he's got to be the
[1:21:17] nature of this pest house
[1:21:20] see
[1:21:21] and and the nature of this pest house
[1:21:25] is is the nature
[1:21:27] of my spirit
[1:21:29] because my spirit is the life that lives
[1:21:31] in this pest house
[1:21:34] and what you know what you what i'm
[1:21:35] seeing what you're talking about there
[1:21:38] is that that spirit
[1:21:41] uh it's uh
[1:21:44] it's it's governed by two natures
[1:21:48] and i believe you come here with the
[1:21:50] nature of satan
[1:21:52] as your soul
[1:21:54] i believe when you're born again that
[1:21:56] nature leads you
[1:21:58] and the nature of almighty god the lord
[1:22:00] jesus christ comes up and takes
[1:22:02] residence in your life
[1:22:04] now
[1:22:06] if i'm going to do something evil
[1:22:09] or or be overcome by satan he's going to
[1:22:12] have to do it from the outside in the
[1:22:14] into
[1:22:15] my spirit and my spirit acts and my body
[1:22:19] acts in relation to what that is
[1:22:22] if i'm born again and i'm doing in
[1:22:24] nature and and you see a godly nature
[1:22:26] about me that's that born-again
[1:22:28] experience
[1:22:29] it's working from the inside so what
[1:22:31] you're saying there a minute ago
[1:22:33] is it really that nature
[1:22:36] that spirit uh
[1:22:39] it's not sinful
[1:22:42] the nature inside of is simple
[1:22:44] or the nature outside
[1:22:46] it oppresses it that doesn't replace it
[1:22:49] but the nature of my side
[1:22:51] oppresses
[1:22:53] that spirit
[1:22:55] so
[1:22:56] to me what you're what what you're
[1:22:58] saying there is i believe that your body
[1:23:00] goes to the grave
[1:23:02] your soul your spirit goes to god he
[1:23:04] gave it
[1:23:06] and there's nothing wrong with that fear
[1:23:09] it's a soul
[1:23:12] that goes into the dimension
[1:23:14] of the dead or the
[1:23:17] the lost the lost realm
[1:23:21] or if it's if it's not born again that's
[1:23:24] where it goes to
[1:23:25] but if it's born again then it goes it
[1:23:28] goes
[1:23:29] to whether the bride is taking up her
[1:23:31] residence as a theophany
[1:23:34] and both of them are theophanies
[1:23:37] now i believe i got that
[1:23:40] i believe i said that's just like it's
[1:23:42] christmas time
[1:23:43] you know i just praise god
[1:23:47] you know
[1:23:48] about christmas this is this is a to me
[1:23:52] for a christian
[1:23:54] this is the most
[1:23:56] just dynamic whatever you i don't know
[1:23:58] what word you use
[1:24:00] because it's a manifestation of god
[1:24:03] in human flesh
[1:24:05] and if you're born again
[1:24:08] if the lord jesus christ lives in you
[1:24:11] if you've had that born-again experience
[1:24:14] and he's taken up residence in your life
[1:24:17] then he's living in there
[1:24:20] as your theology
[1:24:22] as your boring inexperience
[1:24:25] and uh what you were saying there just a
[1:24:28] minute ago you know i believe the evil
[1:24:30] thing is the spirit i mean excuse me the
[1:24:34] evil thing is the soul
[1:24:35] it's whether or not it's of god or not
[1:24:38] if it's not a goddess of satan
[1:24:41] this is satan you know what that is we
[1:24:44] come here that way
[1:24:46] i just that's what you was talking about
[1:24:48] there a minute ago i just
[1:24:50] want to explain that but you know
[1:24:52] a lot of times we have a
[1:24:55] we have a
[1:24:56] problem
[1:24:57] we can't listen to people because well
[1:24:59] you're just you're just this or you're
[1:25:01] just that and it's god almighty standing
[1:25:04] there
[1:25:05] in human flesh
[1:25:07] trying to tell you something
[1:25:08] trying to show something
[1:25:11] well that's what i thought about that
[1:25:13] that this morning what you thought and
[1:25:15] let's share with gail to you know you
[1:25:17] we're talking about this morning about
[1:25:19] the about the earthquakes
[1:25:22] well you know this is earth this thing
[1:25:24] i'm walking in this earth you know
[1:25:27] is it had a spiritual earthquake
[1:25:30] and i think that's what you were talking
[1:25:32] about before because that's where i got
[1:25:34] it from
[1:25:36] is what you're talking about this
[1:25:37] morning when you talk about the
[1:25:38] earthquake if we had a an eruption
[1:25:43] you know
[1:25:45] and it's in this place that we walk
[1:25:47] around in
[1:25:49] i don't you don't want to get anything
[1:25:51] out of that nothing that just come to me
[1:25:53] when you were
[1:25:54] they called quakers coming
[1:25:58] well you know
[1:25:59] the other day uh the scripture was read
[1:26:01] and i remember
[1:26:03] i remember when it was talked to me what
[1:26:05] the what the what the acts 2 38 was
[1:26:10] and uh
[1:26:12] and i remember
[1:26:14] that i was pricked in my heart
[1:26:18] how many people just you know
[1:26:20] been in a trinitarian church for
[1:26:23] for 20 25 years
[1:26:25] as a deacon an elder or whatever you
[1:26:27] want to have and then all of a sudden
[1:26:29] the scriptures brought to you and and
[1:26:31] you feel that tree
[1:26:34] you know
[1:26:36] i think maybe
[1:26:37] you know there's a lot of people
[1:26:39] that have experienced acts 238 without
[1:26:42] debris
[1:26:44] you know good knowledge
[1:26:45] well you know i just i'm just telling
[1:26:48] this because
[1:26:49] because this is what i see
[1:26:52] you know
[1:26:53] and i just praise god
[1:26:56] and we're living in a time
[1:26:59] that in what you said this morning
[1:27:01] these people
[1:27:03] they see you
[1:27:06] and they come to an understanding
[1:27:08] they might not hear the word but they
[1:27:10] see you
[1:27:11] and they come to an understanding
[1:27:14] of what what what real person to me is
[1:27:16] listen
[1:27:20] being what really being a christian is
[1:27:23] i just i just thought i'd say that i'm
[1:27:25] just you know
[1:27:26] appreciated
[1:27:31] see to me
[1:27:32] yes
[1:27:34] to me
[1:27:35] it takes body spirit and soul to make a
[1:27:37] person all right
[1:27:40] you know
[1:27:41] that's the the parts
[1:27:44] your body is
[1:27:46] coming from the earth comes from mom and
[1:27:48] dad he brought into the world right you
[1:27:50] know
[1:27:51] your spirit is a permitted
[1:27:54] the prophet used it because of the
[1:27:56] fallen condition
[1:27:57] but adam's his spirit wasn't perverted
[1:28:01] there was no perversion in his spirit
[1:28:03] form because it was created perfect
[1:28:06] eve was created perfect but it went
[1:28:07] wrong
[1:28:08] because of the fall
[1:28:11] and it began to pervert around said
[1:28:13] through her uh flus which he would cover
[1:28:15] that as your memory reason conscious
[1:28:17] affection something
[1:28:19] through your spirit realm
[1:28:21] but then your soul is the real part of
[1:28:24] you
[1:28:25] that god is dealing with
[1:28:29] because he has to work through your body
[1:28:31] because that's the hearing the things
[1:28:33] right he has to go through your
[1:28:35] reasoning you remember your you know
[1:28:37] your affection tonight because that's a
[1:28:38] part of you
[1:28:40] but he's trying to deal with that inward
[1:28:42] part
[1:28:43] of what you really are
[1:28:45] and then two if we went see and and i've
[1:28:48] got another part right here
[1:28:50] to go on to
[1:28:51] if you just if this thing just went like
[1:28:53] a lot of people thinks that we're going
[1:28:55] out of here
[1:28:56] and we're going up to a utopia and you
[1:28:58] know we're old bodies down here we don't
[1:29:00] need it no more well now that part are
[1:29:02] you gone
[1:29:05] you don't have the groaning
[1:29:10] the older we're getting we're groaning
[1:29:11] for a change
[1:29:14] that's the point we're groaning within
[1:29:16] ourselves right waiting for a change you
[1:29:18] call it old age or whatever you'll call
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:22] but see the real you inside of there
[1:29:26] it's either the brother said it's either
[1:29:27] born again or it's lost that's right
[1:29:30] so if it's lost and it dies it has a
[1:29:32] place to go to
[1:29:35] we call it fifth dimensional situation
[1:29:38] you know because that would be the
[1:29:39] center dead
[1:29:41] but then you would call the others as
[1:29:42] they're going up to a six dimensional
[1:29:44] situation
[1:29:46] and we have one in here in a minute
[1:29:48] connecting 126 and 27 with that they
[1:29:50] won't wait to get to it but
[1:29:54] see
[1:29:55] to me
[1:29:57] i don't believe that you're
[1:29:59] i don't believe we understand the soul
[1:30:03] and and i'm just saying i don't either a
[1:30:05] lot but i don't believe we understand
[1:30:07] the spirit part
[1:30:10] in the body
[1:30:13] because we're always trying to blame
[1:30:14] something else
[1:30:16] you know
[1:30:17] we we want to blame something else for
[1:30:20] our problems you know
[1:30:21] but with the spirit we're going to blame
[1:30:23] the body
[1:30:25] well the body's useless without the
[1:30:27] spirit it can't do anything
[1:30:29] all right
[1:30:30] but then the spirit of man is a real
[1:30:34] part of man that's right
[1:30:36] it's not just a
[1:30:38] condition or an existence or
[1:30:41] something that would display a
[1:30:43] a way of doing it is actually real
[1:30:47] that's right god created it
[1:30:50] animals have a spirit part of them right
[1:30:52] there
[1:30:54] a life right they don't have the soul
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:57] but they have a spirit part about it
[1:30:59] that motivates them
[1:31:02] and then that that's real
[1:31:04] right you can see them doing it bird dog
[1:31:06] will point you know
[1:31:08] you don't have to be trained he'll point
[1:31:10] because he's a bird dog
[1:31:12] and you know because that's you take a
[1:31:14] quarter horse these quarter orbs
[1:31:16] you take a tennessee walker now you have
[1:31:18] to make them to pick their feet higher
[1:31:19] to make it look better for these other
[1:31:20] but they'll pick their feet up pretty
[1:31:22] good
[1:31:23] and they just torture them to make them
[1:31:24] go higher you know make it look
[1:31:26] beautiful for everybody but
[1:31:28] see i believe that we don't realize that
[1:31:30] all of these parts of us are real
[1:31:35] we we can deal with this out here a
[1:31:36] little bit
[1:31:38] the body you know we kind of deal that
[1:31:40] because we you know well i know about
[1:31:42] that
[1:31:44] but inside of there has to be a spirit
[1:31:46] yes right
[1:31:49] and we'll get to it in a minute it is
[1:31:51] not the brain
[1:31:52] or the mind yes
[1:31:56] it works through that that's right
[1:31:59] and like i read another day about
[1:32:01] evolution and
[1:32:02] to think as
[1:32:04] complicated as we are as a human being
[1:32:06] what we're made and then somebody think
[1:32:08] we laid on one side and
[1:32:10] grown an arm flipped over on the other
[1:32:12] side and grabbed another one wound up
[1:32:13] getting an eyeball from this side and i
[1:32:15] bought from that side and
[1:32:17] you know i mean
[1:32:18] i i i can't go that way
[1:32:21] i just i can't stand that this goes too
[1:32:23] far
[1:32:24] but i believe the spirit of man is a
[1:32:25] real part of you
[1:32:27] i believe your soul is a real part of
[1:32:29] you
[1:32:31] and your body is a real part
[1:32:33] you don't put them together
[1:32:35] won't work that's right the change is
[1:32:37] going to be
[1:32:39] for the body
[1:32:41] and to take away that start of the
[1:32:43] spirit
[1:32:44] that would be
[1:32:46] an unusable ever what you would want to
[1:32:48] call it
[1:32:50] because the bible says come let us
[1:32:51] reason together there's nothing wrong
[1:32:52] with reasoning if it's according to the
[1:32:54] word
[1:32:56] there's nothing wrong with your memory
[1:32:58] if your memory is according to good
[1:33:00] things
[1:33:03] and you actually love god with your
[1:33:05] spirit
[1:33:09] so then
[1:33:10] we don't want to just make it a
[1:33:12] well the spirit's nothing
[1:33:15] because it has to be a part of us
[1:33:18] okay sister truly
[1:33:21] we're still in this part and then we'll
[1:33:22] get
[1:33:23] some more questions
[1:33:27] i always believe that the spirit came to
[1:33:30] a newborn baby and that's what made all
[1:33:33] of the body mechanisms that god created
[1:33:36] work together
[1:33:38] a fetus has
[1:33:41] my brother graham said it's just
[1:33:42] wiggling jumping muscles but if you
[1:33:44] poked it it would react
[1:33:47] that's just a nervous reaction but to
[1:33:48] have all those body
[1:33:50] functions work together i thought came
[1:33:53] from the spirit
[1:33:54] that baby god when it was born
[1:33:58] and
[1:33:59] in that
[1:34:00] light is that part of the soul
[1:34:03] but that's what i don't understand how
[1:34:06] how they can be separated and yet
[1:34:09] the souls that are in the fifth
[1:34:10] dimension
[1:34:12] have they're moving beings they have
[1:34:14] spirit as far as i can
[1:34:18] you see then you're
[1:34:20] like you're saying let's go back to a
[1:34:21] baby
[1:34:23] when a baby's born
[1:34:25] it can't be born
[1:34:28] the the body is
[1:34:30] come from mom and daddy we know that
[1:34:32] but the uh
[1:34:33] the spirit and the soul would have to
[1:34:35] come from god
[1:34:37] so then god would have to give when the
[1:34:39] baby is born not just a soul
[1:34:42] you would have to give it a spirit part
[1:34:44] yes all right but when an animal is born
[1:34:48] look how close they get
[1:34:50] they would get a spirit part
[1:34:53] to make them work
[1:34:56] all right
[1:34:57] and they would have to be trained
[1:35:00] to a degree to be able to do what they
[1:35:03] do and that would be natural learning
[1:35:04] from mama and daddy whatever you know
[1:35:06] show them how to hunt what to do
[1:35:09] but it's still that
[1:35:11] it starts working off with a degree of
[1:35:13] saying of their memory an animal would
[1:35:16] have a certain amount of memory
[1:35:19] it would have a first certain amount of
[1:35:21] affections
[1:35:23] it loves its little ones
[1:35:27] it can
[1:35:29] reason out to a certain degree
[1:35:32] all right now i use that word best way i
[1:35:34] know a certain degree
[1:35:36] because it won't go along with the soul
[1:35:38] to be in
[1:35:39] the fullness of
[1:35:40] it but what's so amazing to me is you
[1:35:43] take a a baby
[1:35:46] that's say six months old because of
[1:35:48] that whether you get to work with
[1:35:50] turnover
[1:35:51] but you take a baby
[1:35:53] especially when it gets up to
[1:35:55] seven or eight nine ten months old you
[1:35:57] put it on a table
[1:35:59] it'll crawl over to the side and just
[1:36:00] fall off
[1:36:04] but you take a dog
[1:36:07] that's only just
[1:36:09] a month old maybe
[1:36:11] especially when you get where it could
[1:36:12] see maybe it's either
[1:36:14] you put it on the table and they go to
[1:36:15] the edges and it'll look off it won't
[1:36:17] fall
[1:36:19] it looks like they got it on us
[1:36:22] you know
[1:36:23] they look like they know more about life
[1:36:24] than we do
[1:36:26] but i believe that's the reasoning part
[1:36:28] of the form that they would have of the
[1:36:30] spirit part of them
[1:36:33] that would make them work
[1:36:35] you know so god would have to give them
[1:36:37] a little more
[1:36:40] greater manifestations in their early
[1:36:42] life
[1:36:44] than he would to say a baby
[1:36:46] let's see then a baby
[1:36:49] when it comes into the
[1:36:50] world god gives it a spirit
[1:36:55] and and it'll start working on that baby
[1:36:58] that's why it's so
[1:37:00] um important to
[1:37:02] to train those children correct from a
[1:37:04] little bitty baby
[1:37:05] like you always hear me say you know the
[1:37:07] poor baby starts into the world
[1:37:09] it's laying up in a hospital bed it's
[1:37:11] just been born and a couple of nurses
[1:37:13] out there cussing and raising cane going
[1:37:16] all the full moon babies are coming you
[1:37:18] know
[1:37:19] and the poor little thing that first
[1:37:20] thing he hears
[1:37:23] you know
[1:37:25] and you know you've got parts about you
[1:37:28] that work
[1:37:30] according to what is there but that
[1:37:31] spirit of that by abc would start being
[1:37:34] trained in the wrong direction
[1:37:36] and that's what satan done to eve he
[1:37:38] didn't jump in all at once
[1:37:41] he began to work through her
[1:37:44] reasoning factors of her
[1:37:46] spirit and he began to worry that he
[1:37:49] would actually get to her and make her
[1:37:51] think wrong
[1:37:52] but the baby
[1:37:54] is born into a family
[1:37:56] that nobody lies nobody cheats nobody
[1:37:59] steals why is the baby a thief
[1:38:01] why is the baby a liar
[1:38:03] cookie all over his face cookie in his
[1:38:05] hand you ask the baby you ain't cooking
[1:38:09] it's gotta come from somewhere else
[1:38:12] so jeffrey make sure you don't teach
[1:38:13] that baby wrong
[1:38:17] because you got responsibilities
[1:38:20] that goes with with the doing
[1:38:22] because that spirit is part of you just
[1:38:24] like a dog that has a spirit
[1:38:27] part about it
[1:38:28] and we have that part to make us reason
[1:38:32] but by being the soul within us
[1:38:37] now not to say a separate part
[1:38:40] but a separate part of the unity we call
[1:38:42] it our eunuch
[1:38:44] that soul is
[1:38:46] in god's image when it's created
[1:38:50] because it's created perfect
[1:38:54] a baby doesn't
[1:38:57] you know
[1:38:58] how that wrongness
[1:39:01] is perfect
[1:39:06] and that little soul that's within there
[1:39:09] starts
[1:39:10] a life living
[1:39:14] and to me what happens is as i said
[1:39:16] satan he goes through that spirit part
[1:39:19] and he perverts that
[1:39:21] inner being
[1:39:23] or in other words he gives it his nature
[1:39:26] his nature now satan can't can't create
[1:39:29] a soul right i don't believe in that
[1:39:31] name i don't believe he can create a
[1:39:33] soul they can't create anything it only
[1:39:35] creates habit trouble
[1:39:38] but what he does he starts working
[1:39:40] through the spirit realm
[1:39:43] and the nature of the little baby
[1:39:45] becomes according to the nature of the
[1:39:47] spirit realm
[1:39:50] you follow me
[1:39:52] and it's taught wrong
[1:39:55] well then the nature of the soul
[1:39:58] would be wrong
[1:39:59] the soul itself would be wrong because
[1:40:01] it could only motivate according to the
[1:40:03] nature of the spirit part that's within
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:06] because i believe that spirit part is
[1:40:08] real
[1:40:09] it's not just thoughts and imaginations
[1:40:12] it's not just
[1:40:13] or it's a real connecting part of you
[1:40:20] and it will always be a part of us
[1:40:22] that's why i believe when when you
[1:40:24] receive the new birth you don't get a
[1:40:25] new the bible says you get a new spirit
[1:40:28] yes all right now brother around says
[1:40:30] you couldn't stand your own self reason
[1:40:32] it's saying that
[1:40:33] but salvation deals with the soul of the
[1:40:36] individual
[1:40:38] not the body and spirit amen there's too
[1:40:40] many people that are christians
[1:40:42] so-called in spirit realm that's right
[1:40:45] because they love god they go to church
[1:40:48] they worship
[1:40:50] but they didn't go out and just live
[1:40:51] like the devil
[1:40:55] see there's something wrong there
[1:40:57] because a true christian
[1:40:59] won't work that away
[1:41:02] see that's why when that soul is
[1:41:03] perverted
[1:41:06] and satan can give it to nature right
[1:41:09] around said even those fallen angels
[1:41:11] he said they give you a nature
[1:41:16] see why because through your spirit they
[1:41:18] pervert you yes
[1:41:19] everything we have now is a perversion
[1:41:22] right yes
[1:41:25] when you look at it at the world right
[1:41:26] around insanity on this
[1:41:28] out of diverse streets can you look at
[1:41:30] it now
[1:41:34] and you you parents with your children
[1:41:38] watch what they
[1:41:40] want
[1:41:42] on the tvs the the internet systems or
[1:41:45] things
[1:41:47] watch what you allow them to see
[1:41:50] because that's going into their memory
[1:41:51] bank
[1:41:54] right
[1:41:57] you see them out now that they they want
[1:41:59] to kill somebody to know what it is to
[1:42:01] say they blow the brain out you know
[1:42:05] kids want to know what it is they say
[1:42:07] well the reason i don't care i just want
[1:42:08] to see what it was to kill somebody
[1:42:12] why don't they turn the gun around and
[1:42:13] shoot themselves
[1:42:15] because they wouldn't have too much of a
[1:42:17] memory about what that place
[1:42:19] but they don't want to do it that way
[1:42:20] they want to see what happens to harm to
[1:42:22] others
[1:42:24] and how it would be
[1:42:27] even back when we had a tv back in the
[1:42:29] baptist church we started monitoring
[1:42:31] when our kids were watching
[1:42:34] and that was back in 1950s
[1:42:39] right
[1:42:41] and we left the baptist church
[1:42:48] what was on tv back then
[1:42:52] yet we were already monitoring our kids
[1:42:57] kids get to seeing this stuff on the
[1:42:59] movies the thing now they want to go out
[1:43:01] and act like it
[1:43:02] right
[1:43:03] we want to go out swinging the trees
[1:43:06] yeah like
[1:43:08] tarzan or your girls wanted to dress up
[1:43:11] in a friendly little dresses and act
[1:43:12] like
[1:43:13] um
[1:43:14] who
[1:43:15] shirley temple
[1:43:17] you know or something
[1:43:20] see that's a motivating of our natures
[1:43:24] then when you say that the soul is the
[1:43:26] nature of the spirit
[1:43:32] that's true
[1:43:34] but don't just say that soul is just the
[1:43:35] nature because you're just making it
[1:43:37] nothing
[1:43:39] and you're making the spirit more real
[1:43:41] those people make the spirit more real
[1:43:43] than they do the soul
[1:43:45] i believe the soul is a real part of you
[1:43:47] because the soul of the real party is
[1:43:49] what's going to live on even if you die
[1:43:53] but see it's it's got to have that
[1:43:55] spirit to work right
[1:43:58] all right but when you go then what it's
[1:44:00] like the next one when someone dies
[1:44:03] it sounds like
[1:44:06] they're divided
[1:44:09] all right which would be true
[1:44:11] into three different places known as the
[1:44:14] body
[1:44:15] the spirit
[1:44:17] the soul
[1:44:18] and it would have to be a death
[1:44:21] right
[1:44:23] it would have to be a division of death
[1:44:26] because you cannot take this body into
[1:44:29] the presence of god
[1:44:31] and that's why i say our spirit needs
[1:44:33] working on because this spirit even
[1:44:36] though it's good and the good part you'd
[1:44:38] say could go to god
[1:44:41] but there's still another bad part they
[1:44:43] can't go
[1:44:46] and i'm talking about a true born again
[1:44:47] christian yes
[1:44:50] because satan deals with you and your
[1:44:52] spirit realm
[1:44:54] right
[1:44:55] that's what he's trying to get you to
[1:44:56] reason
[1:45:01] you remember brother around when his
[1:45:03] wife and daughter had
[1:45:05] passed away
[1:45:06] and satan began to talk to him
[1:45:10] he said in his reasonings and memories
[1:45:14] he had to be in his spirit room right
[1:45:18] all right
[1:45:19] then all it wants something down on the
[1:45:22] inside of him
[1:45:27] the real
[1:45:28] william branham coming to be
[1:45:32] and the real william branhams would say
[1:45:35] lord even though you've done that
[1:45:38] i love you right now
[1:45:41] and thank you
[1:45:43] know even like the quota i always try to
[1:45:45] give you one that run around said
[1:45:47] he said god said you showed me one time
[1:45:50] you took my wife and daughter
[1:45:52] he said do it again
[1:45:55] that's how sincere the man wanted to be
[1:45:57] incorrect he wasn't meaning he wanted to
[1:46:00] lose his
[1:46:01] second wife and one of the daughters
[1:46:04] that's that's where carnality interferes
[1:46:08] he wanted the lord to cleanse him and
[1:46:10] die
[1:46:13] break him down
[1:46:15] to where that inside man i believe that
[1:46:17] really the per the inside of us is
[1:46:21] i believe you contacted on a rare
[1:46:22] occasion
[1:46:26] honest
[1:46:28] i wish i could say i walked in the realm
[1:46:30] of my soul
[1:46:32] but i don't i walk in the realm of
[1:46:33] natural things
[1:46:35] and my spirit from my memory reason
[1:46:37] consciousness and things is motivating
[1:46:39] me
[1:46:41] and talking to me and guiding me
[1:46:44] but every once in a while the lord says
[1:46:46] that ain't right
[1:46:51] or maybe he'll tell you something that's
[1:46:53] beyond anything that could ever be you
[1:46:56] know and it wouldn't be your spirit
[1:46:57] realm you'd be something on the inside
[1:46:59] of you talking
[1:47:02] and then you'd say the lord give us the
[1:47:04] lord take it away
[1:47:08] see that's where the inward part of man
[1:47:10] the real part that we are
[1:47:13] but in our spirit realm we would reason
[1:47:15] and precautions and things and we try to
[1:47:18] figure out why things are going the way
[1:47:20] it is
[1:47:22] brother around said your reasoning
[1:47:23] things is okay
[1:47:26] if
[1:47:27] it's according to the word that's it
[1:47:29] that's right
[1:47:31] when it ain't according to the word
[1:47:33] that's
[1:47:34] right so something comes to you and
[1:47:37] starts talking to you just
[1:47:39] say well what about the word
[1:47:44] i mean that's all the hopes i've got
[1:47:45] folks
[1:47:47] i preached all of these years to you out
[1:47:49] of one thing and that's exactly what it
[1:47:51] is right there
[1:47:53] that even though things would sound
[1:47:56] right
[1:47:58] beautiful
[1:48:01] there's just something within me says
[1:48:02] that's not that's not right
[1:48:07] well then i'll go back to the word to
[1:48:09] find out what it's doing
[1:48:12] and to see what the word says
[1:48:16] i don't try to reason it out because if
[1:48:18] you do satan's gonna get on there to
[1:48:19] start with with you he's once bringing
[1:48:21] the thought i'm listening he was last
[1:48:22] night to the brother of random i don't
[1:48:24] know what was it though
[1:48:26] what the holy ghost is giving foreign
[1:48:32] and he was talking about
[1:48:34] that he was driving down the road and
[1:48:35] said the devil started talking to him
[1:48:39] well he started telling him all of this
[1:48:41] and telling him that
[1:48:44] like i was saying when he got to that
[1:48:46] point there when his wife and i
[1:48:48] wife and baby died
[1:48:50] do you know that he come to that basis
[1:48:52] and he said
[1:48:53] within himself
[1:48:55] he had reason so much until
[1:48:58] he said if that's the way it is
[1:49:02] go back and listen
[1:49:04] if that's the way it is i won't serve
[1:49:05] him no more he said but something down
[1:49:07] inside of him and said
[1:49:10] the lord give us the lord take it away
[1:49:14] him as a human father and a husband and
[1:49:17] he'd wring some things out and he was
[1:49:19] fixing to agree with the devil
[1:49:22] he said on that one he said i talked to
[1:49:24] the
[1:49:25] devil talk to him i talk to him most of
[1:49:28] the time
[1:49:30] sometimes it gets so carnal i don't even
[1:49:32] listen to anyone i'll just turn that off
[1:49:34] you know but
[1:49:37] i had a while he said satan
[1:49:40] because he was telling him he said well
[1:49:41] you know this man you're talking about
[1:49:43] he's just a man like anybody else he's
[1:49:45] like oral roberts billy graham said he
[1:49:47] just went a little farther than these
[1:49:48] guys and
[1:49:53] he began to talk about the lady you know
[1:49:55] he was saying that
[1:49:59] jesus dwelt did that mean he wouldn't
[1:50:01] god
[1:50:04] he said but when he rolled his shoulders
[1:50:05] back
[1:50:07] and he said lazarus come forth he said
[1:50:10] you talk about who it was
[1:50:13] so he talked to the devil with the
[1:50:14] scriptures
[1:50:15] that's right
[1:50:17] on that inner part
[1:50:19] and you'll see that it can be divided
[1:50:21] and the greatest thing to me that
[1:50:23] divides body soul and spirit is one
[1:50:25] thing
[1:50:27] i know that some people don't agree with
[1:50:29] this part but that's all right
[1:50:33] let's see as a born-again christian you
[1:50:34] can't sin in your soul that's right so
[1:50:38] if there's any sin whatsoever connected
[1:50:40] to the human person
[1:50:42] it's going to have to be through your
[1:50:43] spirit
[1:50:45] because your body can't sin
[1:50:48] without the spirit
[1:50:49] the bible says the body's dead
[1:50:51] you tap a man in the head and you cut
[1:50:53] him if you cut his feelings off all the
[1:50:55] way down you know something in his body
[1:50:58] he ain't got no problems
[1:51:00] his brain might work but the rest of him
[1:51:02] ain't gonna operate
[1:51:03] but then you put a man in an unconscious
[1:51:05] state
[1:51:06] your spirit ain't gonna work nothing's
[1:51:08] gonna work
[1:51:09] all right but you see
[1:51:12] the question when some someone dies it
[1:51:15] sounds like
[1:51:16] that they're divided well they are right
[1:51:20] because that
[1:51:22] body is in one place
[1:51:24] the spirit you would say is in another
[1:51:26] right whatever and the other is the soul
[1:51:30] so it would bring the division and run
[1:51:32] around even states it i believe it he
[1:51:34] said
[1:51:35] the soul would be released
[1:51:37] come and pick up the spirit
[1:51:40] and come to the body
[1:51:42] and he says that's what will happen and
[1:51:44] you and i
[1:51:46] he said especially if we die and go by
[1:51:48] the grave but see what i like about it
[1:51:50] if we don't die go by the grave you know
[1:51:51] what's going to happen
[1:51:53] it's going to happen right here amen
[1:51:55] well that soul that's within there is
[1:51:58] going to go out through that
[1:52:00] spirit and captivate it
[1:52:03] until that body will only be a little
[1:52:05] bit living moving instrumentality yeah
[1:52:08] brother dale do you believe we'll do
[1:52:09] wrong
[1:52:14] brother
[1:52:21] you know in the greatest hour jesus had
[1:52:23] hanging on the cross
[1:52:24] the devil surely could talk to him
[1:52:28] right
[1:52:37] i never believed that we're gonna go
[1:52:39] along you know this is what i i look at
[1:52:41] people and they're preaching and i watch
[1:52:42] it real close and i look at it like here
[1:52:44] we are we're in bad shape we move up
[1:52:46] we're in better shape a little better a
[1:52:49] little better shape we live better shape
[1:52:51] we look we get a little bit better we
[1:52:52] get a little bit better you know but
[1:52:54] while we're just going to get to a place
[1:52:56] to do the old thing on bothers
[1:52:58] now i don't believe that i'm honest
[1:53:01] maybe you do
[1:53:03] i believe the devil ain't going to
[1:53:06] be able to control us that's right
[1:53:12] a lot of difference in what
[1:53:14] i said and what i said there
[1:53:17] the devil run around said you can live
[1:53:19] so close to god the devil don't know
[1:53:21] what to do with you
[1:53:25] well if you call that sinless perfection
[1:53:28] you got a problem
[1:53:30] you better call it holy ghost perfection
[1:53:33] and let it be him all right
[1:53:37] now i've got one question here want to
[1:53:38] move it down so
[1:53:40] um
[1:53:43] i'll put two together in minutes okay
[1:53:48] let me get a half of one okay
[1:53:51] it's five minutes to four
[1:53:54] i didn't know that was that long
[1:53:58] let's leave it right there
[1:54:00] so if i go into the next one
[1:54:02] i'm going to have to cover
[1:54:04] an hour
[1:54:06] i got a good going we got wednesday
[1:54:08] night
[1:54:08] we have questions and answers
[1:54:12] but let me just end it by saying so come
[1:54:14] on musicians
[1:54:15] i believe
[1:54:17] that
[1:54:19] the body the spirit and the soul is a
[1:54:22] unit
[1:54:24] but it must be divided
[1:54:26] not divided like for written aparts and
[1:54:29] doing parts
[1:54:30] it's just realizing what's taking place
[1:54:33] because if we send us in as a christian
[1:54:36] it better not be from our soul
[1:54:38] that's right
[1:54:40] it better be in our spirit being
[1:54:42] i've always tried to explain that
[1:54:44] because if you sin from the soul and you
[1:54:45] say we're just a unit
[1:54:49] you know they said we're all unit by
[1:54:51] spirit soul unit well if you don't
[1:54:53] divide it
[1:54:54] you're going to have that unit sinning
[1:54:56] right because your prophet says we sin
[1:54:58] every day
[1:55:04] so you're gonna have to talk something
[1:55:05] with him but
[1:55:06] listen
[1:55:10] you can love god with your spirit
[1:55:14] and you see people doing that
[1:55:16] and i'm gonna say this and we'll quit
[1:55:17] them because your anointing deals in
[1:55:20] your spirit realm
[1:55:24] that's why you can have in your spirit
[1:55:26] realm
[1:55:27] the baptism of the holy ghost on your
[1:55:30] spirit genuine
[1:55:32] that's it every day of your life and
[1:55:34] don't go to hell right
[1:55:38] and you see people that are in the
[1:55:39] spirit realm
[1:55:41] they're just
[1:55:44] always floating and bubble dancing
[1:55:48] and going and really happy
[1:55:52] but what about the word
[1:55:54] that's it
[1:55:58] one brother said he said i shouted over
[1:56:01] a trinity
[1:56:03] and he said i shot the same way now
[1:56:06] and i thought i believe i'd change that
[1:56:08] statement just to hurt him
[1:56:11] because he was saying i shouted over the
[1:56:13] trinity and i was wrong
[1:56:15] you know shouting now might be wrong
[1:56:18] he didn't realize the statement he made
[1:56:21] but
[1:56:24] see i don't preach the spirits
[1:56:28] you'll never control them that's right
[1:56:33] i don't preach the bodies
[1:56:36] because you'll never give you able to do
[1:56:38] anything with them
[1:56:42] i try to preach to your soul
[1:56:46] and to get you
[1:56:49] to realize
[1:56:52] there's more to this than just coming to
[1:56:54] church
[1:57:01] it's either god living in us or it's not
[1:57:03] god
[1:57:04] right
[1:57:05] that anointed ones
[1:57:07] when i saw it it opened up a lot of
[1:57:09] scripture a lot of understanding
[1:57:12] because you can be anointed in your
[1:57:13] spirit and still be lost
[1:57:15] you love god with your spirit and still
[1:57:17] be lost
[1:57:20] what about that
[1:57:21] come to him one day and say how not i
[1:57:23] cast out devil to thy name and done
[1:57:25] great marvelous work
[1:57:26] and he said depart from me i never knew
[1:57:28] you
[1:57:29] right
[1:57:30] you never had an experience of salvation
[1:57:33] in a new birth
[1:57:34] yeah
[1:57:37] so we better divide spirit body spirit
[1:57:40] soul
[1:57:41] all right let's stand together what we
[1:57:42] got brother
[1:57:44] i'll fly away i'll fly away okay
[1:57:59] i am
[1:58:14] i am
[1:58:31] hi
[1:58:32] everybody
[1:58:46] think about it
[1:59:35] um
[1:59:49] um
[2:00:51] because i can't die
[2:01:00] he wasn't crying and bickering and
[2:01:02] complaining and dropping
[2:01:20] it's not a horrible thing
[2:01:24] but what about a group of people that
[2:01:26] don't have to die
[2:01:30] you say well i just don't know maybe
[2:01:32] we're predestinated
[2:01:34] well
[2:01:35] why can't you believe your
[2:01:36] predestination
[2:01:39] what are you going to believe like i
[2:01:40] said this morning i'm going to start
[2:01:41] saying i'm redeemed
[2:01:43] let's just sing that one
[2:01:45] what's the comment in the booklet i'm
[2:01:47] redeemed
[2:01:55] start confessing it where god can make
[2:01:57] it manifest
[2:01:59] and see that will be the point okay
[2:02:01] somebody got it
[2:02:03] what is it
[2:02:10] i'm ready
[2:02:15] brother richard sings it okay lay it off
[2:02:18] for the room
