[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] opening the eyes
[0:11] open the eyes
[0:15] [Music]
[0:19] I want to see
[0:27] hi
[0:32] shining in
[0:36] oh sure
[0:42] say
[0:45] [Music]
[0:51] [Applause]
[0:53] [Music]
[1:08] Oh
[1:19] [Applause]
[1:29] a man that's our desire to nothing
[1:34] good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:37] let's go ahead and turn umber to Psalm
[1:39] chapter 27 and we'll read the first five
[1:44] verses that's good to be back with
[1:50] everybody as well you know we took a
[1:52] little trip up to to Kentucky and saw
[1:55] some of the the places that brother Brad
[1:58] was birth area and different things and
[2:01] drop the kids off at camp and went on up
[2:04] with it at Ohio and forgotten some good
[2:06] fellowship with everybody and I tell you
[2:10] on the way back that I think the kids
[2:12] got a little bit oh they got a little
[2:14] song that count this year we got it we
[2:16] got them in the car and we just about
[2:18] had a revival on the way back we uh you
[2:21] know it's good to get on that's it's a
[2:26] good thing so but um you know after
[2:30] after the hearing the kids are there
[2:32] there's a lot of rejoicing and different
[2:34] things happen at camp but I just wanted
[2:36] to kind of speak on this evening the
[2:39] topic of confidence because you know
[2:42] where you come back from a camping and
[2:43] everything's you see you know the
[2:47] environment and the atmosphere at camp
[2:49] is it can be a little bit different when
[2:51] you come back to church it's kind of
[2:53] coming to your home Church maybe it's a
[2:55] little bit back to reality back to the
[2:57] real world you go back to your job of
[2:59] different things and but yet there's got
[3:01] to be something to kind of keep you keep
[3:04] you on the straight in there and keep
[3:06] you give you something confident that'll
[3:09] keep you so let's say y'all go ahead and
[3:12] pull that up and well let's go let go
[3:14] let go the Lord in prayer before you
[3:15] read them Lord Jesus we're just so
[3:18] grateful to you tonight or to be able to
[3:20] gather around your word tonight or Jesus
[3:22] and Laura maybe I feel like like David
[3:24] did with us with his sling you know how
[3:26] can I come up against this Goliath but I
[3:28] pray Lord tonight lording you'll do like
[3:31] you did for David and just guide the
[3:33] stone god the words that I say Lord and
[3:35] give me the right words to speak Lord
[3:36] Jesus that you'll help me to articulate
[3:39] it and and phrase it and and just Lord
[3:41] let it be like
[3:42] knife and a razor edge Lord Jesus to go
[3:45] exactly and to be placed exactly where
[3:47] you would have it to be placed we grant
[3:50] it Lord I pray Lord that this won't just
[3:52] be another service Lord Jesus - but Lord
[3:55] that the people Lord will go forth
[3:57] rejoicing and will receive something
[3:59] that will help prepare them on life's
[4:01] way God and give them Lord as the topic
[4:04] I said confidence in your word because
[4:07] we must be confident in this our granite
[4:09] Lord I pray Lord as we give you the
[4:11] remainder of this service Lord we just
[4:13] ask Lord that you'll bless it Lord in
[4:15] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[4:18] so I'm gonna read from Psalms chapter 27
[4:23] verses 1 through 5 and maybe maybe y'all
[4:27] young people if you you get a little
[4:29] extra credit with me if you can tell me
[4:31] the one place where brother Branham
[4:33] quoted this scripture after the service
[4:35] I think it's the one place there might
[4:38] be more than one but but there's one
[4:40] very very renowned sermon a very
[4:44] important sermon that brother Branham
[4:45] read this scripture and it it was really
[4:47] odd because it seemed like why would he
[4:50] read this scripture in that message so
[4:53] so y'all think about that and and if it
[4:56] takes you till next Sunday or you know
[4:58] y'all just have fun with that the Lord
[5:02] is my light and my salvation whom shall
[5:05] I fear the Lord is the strength of my
[5:10] life of whom shall I be afraid when the
[5:14] wicked even mine enemies and my foes
[5:16] came upon me to eat up my flesh they
[5:19] stumbled and fell though and host should
[5:23] encamp against me my heart shall not
[5:25] fear the war should rise against me and
[5:28] this will I be confident one thing have
[5:32] I desired of the Lord that will I seek
[5:34] after that I may dwell in the house of
[5:37] the Lord all the days of my life to
[5:40] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[5:42] enquire in his temple for in the time of
[5:46] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[5:48] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[5:52] hide me he shall set me up
[5:54] on a rock you may be seated the Lord had
[5:57] his blessing upon the reading of the
[5:58] world so you know I think maybe this
[6:04] this day is kind of this the day the
[6:08] scriptural day that we're living in as a
[6:10] time period when above all else we
[6:13] should have confidence because we're
[6:16] being faced with it the unleashing of
[6:18] all that all the demons that are against
[6:20] the 144,000 that are being gathered at
[6:23] Israel now the demons that are against
[6:26] the Bride of Christ and we're faced with
[6:28] an obstacle that no other Church there's
[6:30] not gonna be another church age there's
[6:32] not gonna be anything else there's not
[6:34] gonna be another messenger after this so
[6:37] there's an obstacle in front of us too
[6:39] that we must take a body change and so
[6:42] to take a body change this record gonna
[6:43] require us to accumulate in ourselves a
[6:46] great amount of amount of faith it's
[6:49] gonna umbrella Brown there's a quote
[6:50] that we're brother under said you must
[6:51] accumulate all these accumulate all
[6:54] these words all these words that that
[6:56] we've been given accumulate all this to
[6:58] yourself so that you can have faith and
[7:01] and and y'all hang hang on with me now
[7:04] don't start falling asleep yet it ain't
[7:06] at anytime yeah so and I'm gonna try to
[7:10] be a little bit you know excited or
[7:13] whatever to keep you so that so that we
[7:15] don't struggle too much tonight and
[7:17] listen I rebuke that evil spirit that
[7:19] will call that sleepest pretty you know
[7:21] the kids we were talking about that it
[7:23] seems like it's almost a spirit that
[7:26] gets as soon as the word begins to go
[7:27] forth then the spirit of sleepiness kind
[7:30] of begins to hover over the congregation
[7:32] listen what I'm talking about tonight is
[7:35] that the confidence that will give us
[7:37] something we we must we're relying on
[7:41] something to give us confidence to be
[7:43] able to take a body change and you know
[7:46] when you look begin to look at what the
[7:49] word confidence that it really has a lot
[7:51] of different meanings you know it can it
[7:53] can it can mean you know you're you're
[7:55] confident in yourself and of course you
[7:58] don't we don't want to be confident in
[8:00] our self and our self how are we gonna
[8:01] take a body change how can we do
[8:03] anything and many times you begin to
[8:05] look when you're struggling life is
[8:07] struggle differ
[8:08] things when you're going through
[8:09] sanctification you begin to struggle in
[8:12] yourself well how do I get rid of this
[8:13] addiction to to smoke a cigarette or
[8:17] vaping or or you know you're going out
[8:19] with the wrong crowd and all those
[8:20] different things that have that pool on
[8:22] you and yet you can't do it of your own
[8:25] self and you begin to realize you try to
[8:27] be confident in your own abilities and
[8:29] your own well I'm gonna just try really
[8:31] hard and it just never works out well
[8:33] it's the same thing with healing it's
[8:35] the same thing with the baptism of the
[8:37] Holy Ghost it's the same thing with a
[8:38] body change you can make one hair of
[8:41] your head white or black or anything you
[8:43] can't increase one inch of your stature
[8:45] just by trying real hard and you're not
[8:47] going to be able to take a body change
[8:49] real hard but yes so we've got there's
[8:51] got to be something that we can rely on
[8:53] to give us confidence you see and so so
[8:56] another another word of confidence
[8:59] another meaning of confidence is the
[9:01] state of feeling certain about the truth
[9:04] of something you're certain that that
[9:07] thing is true and you know in life many
[9:09] times just maybe just even in a natural
[9:12] life many times we're not we don't come
[9:14] to the point of being certain about
[9:17] something you know many times the young
[9:20] people when you're kind of get you're
[9:21] kind of getting into a place where you
[9:23] beginning to look for a spouse and
[9:25] you're beginning to look for a job and
[9:27] what do you have to base base your
[9:29] decisions and life on you many times
[9:31] you'll presume many times I mean just
[9:33] looking around because we don't want to
[9:35] be too critical or anything but looking
[9:37] around the message universe the message
[9:39] were looking around to other people you
[9:41] can begin to see that they made bad
[9:42] decisions or they make decisions without
[9:45] confidence they make decisions presuming
[9:48] and you know maybe not something to I
[9:52] got to be careful because I but listen
[9:55] look the young people begin to share
[9:57] stories that they've seen things that
[9:59] they've seen world it might be a little
[10:00] girl and a church would say well you
[10:02] know she wouldn't come home one night
[10:04] and they would their parents will begin
[10:07] to look for them and and and get a text
[10:09] late at night and say well mama and
[10:10] daddy I I went I was confident that I
[10:13] found the right man for me just all of a
[10:15] sudden out of the blue and I presume
[10:17] that he's the right one for me and so I
[10:19] went I ran
[10:20] got married and you see what what kind
[10:23] of a decision is that to be is it but
[10:25] you took to just presume well within
[10:27] yourself that that you know what the
[10:30] right thing is to do you you gotta have
[10:32] something to base your confidence on you
[10:34] see you know I'm reminded that that
[10:36] story of Isaac and Rebecca where he sent
[10:39] someone at Abraham sent someone that he
[10:41] was confident with Eliezer to go get a
[10:43] bride for Isaac and Eliezer didn't just
[10:46] presume he he put my beliefs before the
[10:50] Lord let let her say that she's gonna
[10:52] water my camels let her do these things
[10:54] and she she invite he evaluated properly
[10:57] the situation he made very clear he made
[11:00] certain that the thing the situation
[11:03] before he gave her the gifts before he
[11:05] put the gold rings on her he he made
[11:07] certain of the bride that he had chosen
[11:10] and you see you were talking about
[11:12] presuming but but see God is doing the
[11:15] same thing with us he's trying to he
[11:17] wants to be confident of you he's when
[11:19] he gave you the new birth brother and
[11:21] said he was confident that you would not
[11:22] sin willfully he was confident and when
[11:25] he looked upon you that with confidence
[11:27] believing that you would you would you
[11:29] would continue to walk in the word and
[11:33] you see you see so many times we presume
[11:36] we presume that without confidence we
[11:38] presume maybe that we've got the Holy
[11:40] Ghost different ones presume they come
[11:42] to church and they just kind of sit in
[11:43] the congregation and they don't have
[11:45] confidence they think they do but what
[11:47] is your what is your confidence based on
[11:49] now see that's what maybe when I want to
[11:52] hit on with as you come from camp and
[11:54] different things that is your confidence
[11:56] based on the fact that you ran around a
[11:58] church or as your confidence based upon
[12:00] the fact that you shouted and had a had
[12:02] a good real good Jubilee you had a good
[12:04] of revelation time had a good had a good
[12:08] time in the service
[12:09] but what's your confidence based upon
[12:11] the night what's your what's your
[12:13] confidence based upon as you sit here in
[12:15] church is it is it based upon the fact
[12:17] that you go to Lula is that based upon
[12:19] the fact that you have faith in your
[12:21] pastor and you know you you look around
[12:23] I'm I'll be honest when I began to come
[12:26] to this church it was almost a stumbling
[12:28] block for me because people you could
[12:30] almost form a little denomination and
[12:32] say if you don't go
[12:33] this particular church if you don't go
[12:35] to this church then you're going to be
[12:36] lost and you you form a little
[12:38] denomination there because you've you've
[12:40] put your confidence on the fact that you
[12:41] attend this church but you see there you
[12:44] can't that that kind of confidence won't
[12:47] work because there's only one thing that
[12:49] you can be truly confident in and that
[12:52] is the revealed Word of God I'm sure
[12:57] many of you could guess that's where I'm
[12:59] going and you say well brother Bob maybe
[13:02] this is maybe this is a young person to
[13:04] serve maybe this is a sermon for the
[13:05] young people but I believe it's a sermon
[13:07] for all ages because you see even in the
[13:10] older ones begin to they begin to
[13:13] struggle in life and have health
[13:14] problems and things and you begin to
[13:16] wonder maybe if God has left you and
[13:19] forgot about you you begin to what but
[13:21] you know brother Brown said that God
[13:22] cares about old people too and you begin
[13:25] to wonder if God has left you if you
[13:26] begin to wonder if God has left the
[13:28] church maybe wondering if if God is
[13:30] still here in this in this assembly but
[13:33] I tell you God God is here the way you
[13:35] know that the way that you have
[13:37] confidence is Bob based upon us by the
[13:39] faith in God's Word and you see you look
[13:43] at all the examples in hebrews 11:8 all
[13:45] the examples of the great soldiers of
[13:47] faith and many times they didn't have
[13:49] something some some kind of sensation or
[13:52] something to look at you remember when
[13:53] when the three Hebrew children were led
[13:55] down into the fire I wonder if they felt
[13:57] really good I wonder if they were
[13:58] shouting Jubilees and everything but
[14:00] they went down into that furnace based
[14:03] upon a faith based we put based upon a
[14:04] confidence that they had with God that
[14:07] they knew their God and they knew that
[14:09] those that believe their God would do
[14:11] great exploits they begin they begin to
[14:14] walk down into that furnace even when
[14:15] the guards fell away because they knew
[14:17] they knew who they believed in and they
[14:19] said if God would deliver us and that's
[14:21] great if he will not deliver us and
[14:23] that's fine too we are prepared to die
[14:25] and and and you remember Daniel the
[14:27] story of Daniel and he then went down
[14:29] into the Lions Den I wonder if he what
[14:31] might was may be running around with it
[14:33] with great anointings and all of these
[14:34] things you see you can't put your
[14:37] confidence in a feeling you can't put
[14:39] your confidence in the fact that you ran
[14:42] around but you can put your confidence
[14:43] in a revel
[14:44] of Jesus Christ you see that is even the
[14:48] evidence of the new birth personally to
[14:50] you the evidence of the new birth is
[14:52] that God has given you a revelation God
[14:54] has revealed himself to you not maybe in
[14:56] an Old Testament way where he gives you
[14:58] a like a ware of a revelation for the
[15:00] time and then you go away wondering if
[15:03] you wondering if something really
[15:05] happened but the new birth experience is
[15:08] a confidence that God gives to you I'm
[15:14] jumping ahead of myself
[15:17] listen so confidence confidence is you
[15:24] know another thing that confidence is so
[15:26] confidence could be shellfish surance
[15:28] self-assured confidence confidence could
[15:30] be is the state of feeling certain about
[15:32] the truth of something and and a lot of
[15:35] times confidence has another word is is
[15:37] when you trust somebody to keep a secret
[15:40] you place it in their confidence and so
[15:44] you tell them something and so you see
[15:47] the confidence in the Word of God the
[15:49] confidence in God confidence in a
[15:52] believers life always has something to
[15:54] do with the word the word being spoken
[15:58] and so when God places his confidence in
[16:00] you he tells you a secret
[16:03] he gives you a secret that only you know
[16:05] because there's something personal to
[16:07] you it's a personal relationship with
[16:09] you something something that you can
[16:11] maybe try to explain to others and and
[16:14] when you so is it you know you listen to
[16:16] so many others testimonies of how they
[16:18] got the baptism and only ghost and a lot
[16:21] of times it can be confusing what the
[16:22] baptism the Holy Ghost is because when
[16:25] you begin to explain what happened to
[16:27] you a lot of times the explanation
[16:29] involves running and shouting and and
[16:31] and and and it involves that the the the
[16:35] stimulation of a revelation but deep
[16:37] down on the inside down in that soul
[16:40] something quiet and mysterious took
[16:42] place down on the tabernacle of hearing
[16:44] inside on the inside where you're shut
[16:47] in with God where the curtain closes
[16:49] behind you and nobody else maybe can see
[16:51] what really took place in there because
[16:54] there's something there only
[16:55] you and God know and that's confidence
[16:57] that's confidence when when you can look
[16:59] through that smoke coming off the altar
[17:01] of incense and peer into the Holy of
[17:03] Holies and look over that mercy seat and
[17:06] see the glory of God coming back to you
[17:08] and enter into communion with him that's
[17:10] the confidence that the world cannot
[17:12] take away that's a confidence that that
[17:15] is far beyond maybe just running around
[17:18] and jumping and screaming and shouting a
[17:20] confidence that's far above just an
[17:22] anointing on your flesh or on your
[17:24] spirit a confidence that comes by the
[17:27] see word of God being planted down on
[17:29] the inside but you know you many times
[17:37] confidence confidence comes by and
[17:40] experience and confidence comes by a
[17:44] little journey you know you wouldn't
[17:46] those of you that like me that are and
[17:49] my wife they're training up our children
[17:51] and how to drive it takes a while for
[17:54] you to get that go ahead and laugh at
[17:56] you it takes a while for you to get
[17:59] confident in their ability to turn them
[18:02] loose and let them have free rein with
[18:05] that it takes comfort it takes awhile to
[18:08] have confidence and you see the same a
[18:10] lot of people in the Bible went through
[18:12] a journey you're going through a journey
[18:15] a journey where at the end of that
[18:18] journey God will have confidence in you
[18:20] you see Abraham when he got called maybe
[18:22] God had confidence in him now don't get
[18:25] me wrong but he he wants to see it play
[18:27] out you see and he'll give you tests and
[18:30] things that you go through so that he
[18:33] can observe and so that you can
[18:34] understand yourself that that you truly
[18:37] do believe in God's Word and so so then
[18:42] when you when you have gone through the
[18:44] experience you can look back and you can
[18:47] say I know because I was there when I
[18:51] was there within the spirit film I was
[18:54] there when God gave me a revelation
[18:56] Abraham could look back and say I was
[18:59] there
[19:00] God called me and turned me aside and I
[19:03] went in a different direction I was
[19:05] there when I parted ways with a lot I
[19:08] was there when God put me to sleep and
[19:10] he he moved between the sacrifices I was
[19:14] there when I took God at His Word and I
[19:16] I took my son the promised son and I
[19:19] took him up on the mountain and raised
[19:21] up my knife and I was there when Jehovah
[19:23] Jireh came on the scene and provided a
[19:25] lamb he provided a sacrifice I was there
[19:28] and you see that's the kind of
[19:30] confidence that comes from a new birth a
[19:33] new a born-again experienced the
[19:35] confidence well you can look back and
[19:37] say I remember I was there when God gave
[19:40] me faith I was there when virtue was
[19:43] birthed into me I was there when
[19:45] knowledge I was there and all of these
[19:47] things were put into me I was there and
[19:49] you see Abraham he had such confidence
[19:52] with God that for 25 years he held on to
[19:55] the promise until he could hold that
[19:57] baby in his arms he had my when you look
[20:01] at these old soldiers of faith and think
[20:03] about think about the troubles and the
[20:06] problems and things that we do you know
[20:08] maybe all the different therefore the
[20:12] different problems that we suffer in our
[20:15] flesh and all these things just keep
[20:17] hanging on because the same God that
[20:21] Abraham had confidence in that same God
[20:24] is here that you can have confidence in
[20:26] the same God that gave Abraham his
[20:28] children it's the same God that will
[20:30] give you your children if you just have
[20:32] confidence and believe and hang on oh my
[20:37] I'm gonna just share this little test to
[20:39] speak of their children brother brother
[20:42] brother Ronnie long when he was
[20:43] preaching up there in Ohio he he began
[20:46] to share a testimony from behind the
[20:48] pulpit about how when he was in Alaska a
[20:50] this brother came up and began to cry
[20:53] out for his children he said I want all
[20:54] the people that the ministers and
[20:56] whatnot to come up and pray for me
[20:59] because my son I don't know where he is
[21:01] and he's been it was in the wilds of
[21:03] Alaska out there in the middle of
[21:05] nowhere probably many hundreds of miles
[21:07] away from civilization and he said I I
[21:09] don't know where my son is and he's not
[21:11] a creep
[21:11] wanting to be saved and so they began to
[21:14] call out to God for him and begin to to
[21:16] pray for him and begin to believe with
[21:18] him and and at the end of the service
[21:20] that brother Ronnie said he looked in
[21:21] the back of the church and there was a
[21:22] stranger came in and he said it turned
[21:25] out that it was that man's son that out
[21:27] of nowhere in the middle of Alaska had
[21:29] showed up why because the prayer of
[21:31] faith was prayed over that brother and
[21:34] he came see God had been working on the
[21:37] sea I believe God knows you're gonna
[21:38] pray before he before you actually do it
[21:41] the God knew he was good they were gonna
[21:43] pray that prayer and he had him walking
[21:45] in the back of that church and he gave
[21:47] his heart to the Lord and he's still
[21:48] serving the Lord because he checked up
[21:49] on him but you see when you turn your
[21:52] faith and loose will you have confidence
[21:54] with God it will cause the reaction if
[21:56] you get on your knees and begin to cry
[21:58] out and call out to God for your
[21:59] children the Spirit of God will move
[22:01] upon your children just like he moved
[22:03] upon the earth and called sea to come up
[22:05] just like he moved upon Paul's heart
[22:07] just appalled just how he moved upon all
[22:10] the ones down through time to God what
[22:12] God is still able God is still God and I
[22:15] have confidence in that listen I know
[22:19] this is maybe a simple sermon tonight
[22:20] but if anything if you get anything out
[22:23] of this remember that God is still able
[22:25] have confidence in him believe on him
[22:28] have have the same kind of confidence
[22:29] like Peter did when Jesus said come to
[22:32] me and he took a step out of that boat
[22:35] and put his foot on the water and
[22:37] something was holding him up there was
[22:39] actually a substance that was holding
[22:41] him up he had confidence in the words of
[22:44] Christ he had confidence that if Jesus
[22:46] said come when he looked at Jesus
[22:48] walking on the water he knew that if
[22:50] Jesus could do it I believe he believed
[22:52] that I can do it too
[22:53] and that you know Jesus told us that he
[22:56] said greater works than these shall do
[22:58] their works that I do shall you do also
[23:01] you'll go into all the world preaching
[23:03] the gospel laying hands on the sick and
[23:06] they shall recover and all the other
[23:07] things because God has put his spirit
[23:10] into the church he's put his life into
[23:12] the church to give us confidence do you
[23:14] think about little Mary coming to Jesus
[23:17] feet with confidence not knowing what
[23:19] the reaction of Jesus would be when she
[23:21] began to wash his feet and she knew that
[23:23] something special about that man and it
[23:26] wasn't right for him to come into that
[23:27] house and not be greeted and not have
[23:29] his feet washed and not be anointed and
[23:31] she began to unknowing his feet with
[23:33] confidence knowing that he was the
[23:35] Messiah I believe that she knew who that
[23:38] man was and she came with confidence and
[23:40] when he looked up but not with scornful
[23:42] eyes but he looked up and he said your
[23:44] sins forgiven your sins though they are
[23:48] many are forgiven you because she had
[23:51] confidence she had confidence in that
[23:54] one
[23:54] she had confidence in the word that was
[23:57] sitting there in front of her and if you
[23:58] and I will have that same kind of
[24:00] confidence in the word that we have
[24:02] heard whether or not we feel anything
[24:04] whether or not we were honor whether we
[24:06] shout but if we'll just take a simple
[24:08] faith just believe on the Lord God that
[24:12] God will work wonders listen I believe
[24:18] that God is still a miracle working God
[24:20] you know sometimes many times as you
[24:23] just go through life you can get into a
[24:24] rut where you begin to think that God is
[24:26] still not working he's still not moving
[24:28] and we we were coming back and we heard
[24:30] many testimonies from the young people
[24:32] of great miraculous things to work God
[24:36] working in the young people and listen
[24:38] if God was working these little eleven
[24:40] and twelve year olds that are laying
[24:41] hands on one another and seeing healings
[24:44] in their body right under their
[24:45] fingertips while they're praying for one
[24:47] another a little twelve year olds going
[24:49] up to one another do you want me to pray
[24:51] with you do you won't meet me print
[24:53] let's all pray together and God doing
[24:55] things I wonder maybe if the older ones
[24:59] if we're if there's something lacking if
[25:00] there's some kind of confidence lacking
[25:02] in our lives Jesus said let the little
[25:08] children coming to me because a little
[25:09] children up in Humbert encumbered by but
[25:12] by egos and and pride and malice and all
[25:15] the things that that the older ones
[25:17] maybe let just kind of we can almost
[25:19] close ourselves with wondering whether
[25:21] or not somebody likes us and all those
[25:23] things but a little children could just
[25:24] they just run one another under one
[25:27] another let me pray for you I love you
[25:29] and everybody loves one another you know
[25:32] I believe that's what the Holy Spirit
[25:33] was sent for to do when the Holy Spirit
[25:35] begins to come into the lives of the
[25:36] believer
[25:37] it makes you drunk drunk on that
[25:39] stimulation of Revelation like they had
[25:41] on the day of Pentecost a drunk man will
[25:43] love everybody a drunk man don't care
[25:45] who you are drunk man will put his arms
[25:47] around somebody's I love you I love you
[25:50] now I will I I want to be your friend
[25:52] and that's that's what I believe well I
[25:55] believe we're lacking but you see our
[26:03] confidence is in Christ let's read one
[26:08] quote number one because I you know
[26:20] confidence comes from words words words
[26:25] can even in a relationship and a
[26:27] marriage relationship can can can can
[26:29] create an atmosphere can cause heart
[26:33] feelings for years and and there's this
[26:36] this profound quote that brother Graham
[26:39] said I think this is the only time where
[26:41] he mentioned this golden bowl in the
[26:43] heart that is affected by your words
[26:46] that you speak and he said this and
[26:48] believers tell this will now remember
[26:50] happiness does not consist of how much
[26:52] of the world's good you own but how
[26:54] contented you are with the portion
[26:56] that's allotted you so that's what it be
[26:59] I said now there'll be times that you
[27:02] all won't see things like he's talking
[27:04] about this married couple that are a
[27:05] couple that he's talking to you that
[27:07] will they will get they want to get
[27:08] married but always remember you're still
[27:11] in love when you see one set in the way
[27:15] and the other one don't I said give in
[27:17] if they're wrong it'll show after a
[27:20] while it'll be all right I said there's
[27:22] a little Bowl and a human heart that is
[27:24] full of gold and oil called love if it
[27:28] has ever broke it can be healed up but
[27:30] there'll be a scar there as long as you
[27:32] live that little Bowl down in a human
[27:35] heart that brother branham said the way
[27:39] that thing gets broken is by words you
[27:43] see a married couple going along through
[27:45] life and how important it is to say the
[27:48] right words
[27:49] to one another to Express at you know
[27:52] without that is what builds confidence
[27:54] confidence in a spiritual relationship
[27:57] the words that we hear from God build
[27:59] our confidence and God is not telling us
[28:02] we're dogs in this day God is calling us
[28:05] his bride God is telling us that he's
[28:08] confident in us God is telling us saying
[28:11] he we're gonna take a body change and
[28:13] you see yeah I was listening to a
[28:16] testimony I maybe I couldn't tell you
[28:19] all the details but this this brother
[28:20] that was this brother that that brother
[28:23] Branham had had told him in a vision
[28:25] that he was gonna marry this girl
[28:28] and they they got married and he said
[28:30] over time you know I begin this is this
[28:33] is a you talk about people believing in
[28:35] soulmates which is something brother
[28:36] Branham said I never I never taught
[28:38] soulmates I never taught that but people
[28:40] believe that you you believe you know
[28:43] when you find that the right one the
[28:45] person that that that you commune with
[28:48] that is right for you and how much
[28:50] greater a matchmaking could it be for
[28:53] the prophet of God Himself to match two
[28:57] people together which is what happened
[28:58] in this situation and if you want to
[29:00] know details you can ask me later and I
[29:02] can I can I can hunt that up for you
[29:04] with this brother and sister they got
[29:06] married and and the brother began to
[29:08] share that that over time he began that
[29:11] he began to begin to speak hateful to
[29:14] that to his wife and begin to now this
[29:16] was a match that was matched by the
[29:19] prophet of God and he began to speak
[29:21] words to her that he said you you could
[29:24] not imagine somebody speaking words like
[29:26] this to somebody and and over time those
[29:29] words began to crack that Golden Bowl
[29:32] because brother brother said once that
[29:34] Golden Bowl gets cracked and the the
[29:37] thing the contents run out it's hard
[29:39] it's hard to repair that and after a
[29:43] while they got they ended up getting
[29:45] divorced you see because words matter
[29:48] the things that you say to one another
[29:50] matter you can ruin a good set up like
[29:54] that a good happy marriage like that
[29:56] because of the world
[29:57] the things that you say and you say well
[29:59] it doesn't matter what I say to my wife
[30:01] she's my wife or whatever and he began
[30:03] to put your thumb owner and just kind of
[30:05] put her down or whatever you know I
[30:06] don't believe that God puts his wife
[30:08] down God I believe that the wife of the
[30:11] bride of God is more than that would say
[30:14] just a byproduct the wife of God in this
[30:17] age is the mystery of God the mystery
[30:20] being revealed the mystery of God
[30:22] revealing himself in the church
[30:24] she and God is speaking words of
[30:27] encouragement and words of faith to her
[30:29] words to build up her confidence and you
[30:32] see maybe I wonder that's really the
[30:34] point of this message tonight is is I
[30:36] wonder if the bride in this day is
[30:38] confident enough to realize who she is
[30:41] I wonder if she's confident enough to
[30:44] realize what God has given her I wonder
[30:47] if she's at a place where she realizes
[30:49] that God is confident with her that God
[30:53] has put his life in her let's get let's
[30:57] go to the next one number two brother
[31:01] when I said in Jesus Christ the same
[31:02] yesterday today and forever he said you
[31:04] mean here that's married why did you
[31:06] marry your wife and see I love the way
[31:10] that brother Branham phrases this he's
[31:12] phrasing it in a confident optimistic
[31:16] manner because you know there's a lot of
[31:17] people that just marry their wife
[31:19] because of carnal desires they just
[31:21] marry him because they just fell into it
[31:23] it was just a big ol accident but here
[31:25] he's speaking something to the church
[31:27] he's he's saying you married you married
[31:30] your wife because you proved it out he
[31:32] said you you had confidence and faith
[31:34] that she'd make a real wife and mother
[31:37] and so forth women back to your
[31:39] husband's the same way sweethearts are
[31:42] thinking of marriage you're studying the
[31:43] man you marry or the girl you're marry
[31:45] you must have faith in them or you
[31:47] better not marry them you better have
[31:50] confidence in them and you know what
[31:52] what kind of confidence should a young
[31:54] man or a woman in the message today have
[31:56] and the person that you want to marry
[31:58] the kind of confidence were they you
[32:01] know that they are a real true believer
[32:03] because they have confidence in God they
[32:07] have confidence in God and see you don't
[32:10] into something just having having like a
[32:12] hope so maybe so have enter into enter
[32:15] into and engagement enter into a
[32:17] relationship where without putting your
[32:20] confidence in that person you don't just
[32:23] presume something you see and God is not
[32:26] presuming with us because you see he had
[32:28] confidence with us before the foundation
[32:31] of the world he knew that that
[32:33] attributes they were predestinated in
[32:35] him would be manifested in each of these
[32:37] church ages he knew that she would be
[32:40] sitting here this morning
[32:41] he knew what your reaction to the word
[32:43] would be and he knew if he could be
[32:45] confident and you or not and that's why
[32:48] he gave you the new birth is because he
[32:50] knew that he could be confident in you
[32:53] but you see words confidence comes from
[32:57] words our confidence comes from the
[33:00] words of God it comes from the Word of
[33:02] God because we're not you know this
[33:04] Bible this Bible is not I found a quote
[33:08] the other day it was one of those quotes
[33:10] that I found it and then I lost it and I
[33:13] could I couldn't find it again but in
[33:15] that quote brother Aaron was saying this
[33:17] is not just any other book this is not a
[33:20] book like the Koran or like the bug ID
[33:23] so whatever it is that the Buddhists
[33:25] read that that one of those books it's
[33:27] not just a book that when you go to the
[33:28] library or the bookstore that you go to
[33:30] the self-help section and you pull off a
[33:32] book so that you can better yourself so
[33:35] that you can be a better person this is
[33:37] this is the word of God in letter form
[33:40] the attributes of God distilled into
[33:42] this letter form and it is so perfect
[33:44] that over thousands of years of time the
[33:48] message in in the book of Revelation is
[33:50] the same as in the book of Genesis it's
[33:53] the same as in the Book of Isaiah
[33:55] it runs in perfect continuity so that
[33:58] when God reveals his mystery to you you
[34:00] but you can begin to read these things
[34:02] read a subtext between the line because
[34:05] you're part you're part of him you're
[34:07] his wife
[34:08] it's a love letter to you and you can
[34:10] read it with that understanding with
[34:12] that knowing
[34:17] so you see what gives you confidence
[34:21] what gives you confidence is the
[34:24] preaching of the gospel
[34:25] the Bible says Hebrews 4:12 for the word
[34:29] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[34:31] than any two-edged sword and I want to
[34:34] dwell on this for a little bit because
[34:35] every time my kids get back from a camp
[34:37] one of the things that they share that
[34:39] gave them confidence is when they were
[34:42] sitting in the congregation they would
[34:44] think something in their mind and the
[34:47] minister a minister whoever it might be
[34:50] would turn and look at them and point
[34:53] and say you think you're not going to
[34:56] get anything tonight or whatever it
[34:57] might be and you see the Word of God is
[35:00] still a discerner of the thoughts and
[35:03] intents of the heart God is still able
[35:05] by the preaching of the gospel to turn
[35:07] to speak to whatever is in your life
[35:09] whether it might be personal struggle
[35:12] wherever you are with sanctification or
[35:14] the new book of traveling up the statue
[35:16] of a perfect man whatever it is God is
[35:18] still able to speak to the situation
[35:21] that you're dealing with the problem
[35:23] that we have many times is that when the
[35:25] word goes forth we are not confident you
[35:29] know many times many times confidence
[35:31] comes from somebody getting a behind the
[35:32] pulpit that lacks these virtues because
[35:35] brother having said that might that
[35:36] would be the biggest stumbling block is
[35:38] to see somebody saying that you need to
[35:40] be living this to do it and then you
[35:42] didn't you walk outside maybe or walk at
[35:44] the cat wherever you are and you stumble
[35:47] over the fact that that that person is
[35:49] missing some of these the missing
[35:51] temperance missing patience those things
[35:54] have not been birthed into their life in
[35:56] it and you you can begin to stumble at
[35:58] the fact that it's a man up there behind
[36:01] the pulpit but yet behind that man are
[36:04] still coming forth the words of God and
[36:07] that's what that's what is almost a
[36:09] mystery of the preaching of the gospel
[36:10] it's a mystery you really now let's
[36:14] think if the Word of God if you could
[36:16] gain confidence by going out and staring
[36:19] at the Sun like they do with the east
[36:20] then that would be the thing that you
[36:22] should do if you would get confidence by
[36:25] going out and pounding your
[36:26] head with a rock or bio by just
[36:28] listening to the birds tweet and
[36:30] chirping the trees then that would be
[36:32] the thing for you to do to get
[36:33] confidence but the way that you get
[36:35] confidence is by the preaching of the
[36:37] gospel because the preaching of the
[36:39] gospel is the Word of Life to you the
[36:41] preaching of the gospel is the greater
[36:43] works that Jesus talked about and Titus
[36:48] one through three it says but hath in
[36:49] due times it let me read this but hath
[36:54] ndu times manifested his word through
[36:56] preaching manifested his word through
[37:00] preaching and many times we stumble over
[37:02] that we stumble because we think well
[37:04] the preaching of the gospel is too rough
[37:06] or it's not rough enough or we think
[37:09] what will they miss quoted a scripture
[37:10] like little many times brother Ram would
[37:12] say 700 instead of 7,000 or whatever
[37:15] well they miss quoted Scripture and so
[37:16] I'm just gonna play some aside I'm not
[37:18] gonna listen to that ministry anymore or
[37:20] or here's the big one they hurt my
[37:22] feelings they hurt my feelings like you
[37:26] know when you come to when you come to
[37:28] the Church of God and the word is going
[37:31] forth if you realize where that word is
[37:33] coming from if you have confidence where
[37:35] that word is coming from it's coming
[37:37] from the Father it's coming from the
[37:40] Lord God Almighty to polish you up to
[37:43] shape you and to mold you into his image
[37:45] and so that's why brother Brennan said
[37:47] if you can't take correction then you
[37:50] don't know who your daddy is you don't
[37:53] know that that word is coming from your
[37:55] father you don't know that the word the
[37:57] New Jerusalem is the mother of us all
[37:59] you don't know who your parents are you
[38:02] don't know who your daddy is and that
[38:04] makes you a bastard born child of God
[38:06] that's why if you can't take correction
[38:08] and listen I I feel like this is I feel
[38:12] like we're almost stressing this because
[38:14] people get hurt right now I begin to
[38:18] realize why not for all these years
[38:19] brother Dale has told us sit on your
[38:22] feelings when the word is God being of
[38:24] God is being preached sit on your
[38:26] feelings because the word is what will
[38:28] benefit you the word is sharper than a
[38:30] two-edged sword let it cut and mold and
[38:33] shape
[38:33] in His image you know the problem is the
[38:38] devil don't like being exposed and when
[38:41] the world is going forth it causes a
[38:43] reaction because of you to come out on
[38:45] the church Santa I feel like he was
[38:47] preaching on me I feel like he was he
[38:49] had some kind of personal motor and
[38:51] objective of course that's even worse
[38:53] when it's the local ministers because we
[38:55] live within we walk with you and we do
[38:57] within you begin to think within
[38:59] yourself where they just got something
[39:00] against me well you know I believe when
[39:03] the word begins to come forth ah you
[39:05] don't have time to think up here when
[39:07] you're preaching if the word comes forth
[39:08] and it slices and it cuts let it cut
[39:11] where may even if it cuts me even if it
[39:14] cuts myself then let it cut and slice
[39:17] where it may yeah you know you know
[39:19] brother that story in the Bible where
[39:22] that little the very first Gentile woman
[39:25] to see America the very first Gentile in
[39:28] the Bible to see a miracle Jesus called
[39:30] her a dog
[39:31] she was saying she was trying to she was
[39:34] trying to approach him using the wrong
[39:35] tile son of David and he said he said my
[39:38] daughter and and he said he the answer
[39:41] not a word and his disciples came and
[39:43] besought him saying send her away for
[39:45] she cries after us but he answered and
[39:47] said I'm not sent but under the lost
[39:48] sheep of the house of Israel and then
[39:50] she came this she came after he said I'm
[39:53] not I'm not said to you what if a
[39:55] minister told you that wonderful
[39:57] Minister said I'm not sent to you but
[39:59] that's not what the ministers are saying
[40:01] the day the ministers are declaring a
[40:03] positive confession to you nobody's
[40:05] calling you a dog but she she when Jesus
[40:08] told those things to her sheep began to
[40:10] worship God and I believe that if every
[40:13] one of us could begin to take that
[40:15] reaction when the word begins to slice
[40:17] and cut just to worship God just to hold
[40:19] up holy hands lift up holy hands I begin
[40:22] to praise him and thank him for the
[40:23] cutting thank you for the slicing then
[40:26] you'll see a miracle like she said even
[40:29] the dogs ate the bread she turned and
[40:32] she began to worship and called him Lord
[40:34] she said Lord and she begun to worship
[40:37] him and I see her see her approach was
[40:40] right
[40:42] many times us while we don't have
[40:44] confidence because we want it on our
[40:46] terms
[40:47] we want the minister to say something we
[40:49] want to diminish her to just stroke us
[40:51] the right way and pay us the right way
[40:53] and preach on our topics and and don't
[40:56] say something that we don't like and and
[40:58] if the minister says something that we
[41:00] disagree with or even maybe something
[41:02] that the pastor disagrees with then we
[41:05] toss them out and we won't never listen
[41:06] to them again listen I believe that the
[41:08] ministry I believe that the ministry is
[41:10] growing too because listen look if you
[41:13] look back 20 or 30 years ago the
[41:15] ministry is not preaching the same thing
[41:17] today that they were back then they're
[41:19] preaching that they're preaching the son
[41:21] of man now they're preaching the
[41:22] revelation of Jesus Christ into the
[41:24] church they're preaching a bride coming
[41:26] into reality they're preaching an
[41:27] adoption I went out to a web site the
[41:30] other day and I began to look through
[41:31] the sermons and I began to I began to
[41:34] marvel because they're preaching
[41:35] adoption and you say you begin to think
[41:37] in yourself well nobody else in the
[41:39] message is preaching like we are here at
[41:41] this church listen there's a five-floor
[41:42] ministry all around the world that is
[41:44] preaching the same gospel and maybe
[41:47] they're not wording it exactly the same
[41:48] way that you or I are or whoever might
[41:51] word it but this there's a bride all
[41:53] around this message and they're catching
[41:55] the revelation I believe it so you see
[42:00] you see the preaching of the gospel is
[42:03] actually part of the greater works that
[42:05] Jesus said greater works shall you do
[42:08] greater works let's meditate on that for
[42:12] a little bit in John 5:20 she just said
[42:16] for the father loveth the son and show
[42:18] with him all things that himself doeth
[42:20] and he will show him greater works than
[42:22] these that ye may marvel I wonder if we
[42:26] have confidence enough to marvel I
[42:28] wonder if we realized the marvelous Ness
[42:31] of the preaching of the gospel when you
[42:34] come to church and you hear something
[42:36] that that will quicken you and give you
[42:38] confidence and give you faith in this
[42:40] our faith to receive healing that is
[42:42] something marvelous for as the father
[42:45] raises up the dead and quickeneth him
[42:48] he's just going around raising up the
[42:50] dead and it was the father working in
[42:52] him and one day Jesus would die and
[42:56] down in the ground but before he died he
[42:57] had confidence that his flesh would not
[43:00] rot he had confidence that before his
[43:02] flesh would arrive it would that Christ
[43:04] would raise him up from the grave so he
[43:07] said for as the father raises up the
[43:09] dead and quickeneth him even so the son
[43:12] quickeneth whom he will I want to
[43:15] declare to you I believe that the son of
[43:17] God has been working down through the
[43:19] seven churches quickening who he will
[43:22] through the preaching of the gospel
[43:23] because that's what Jesus meant in John
[43:25] chapter 14 verses 10 to 13 he said
[43:27] believe us now not that I am in the
[43:29] father and the father and meet the words
[43:32] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[43:34] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[43:36] me he doeth the works believe me that I
[43:39] am in the father and the father in me or
[43:41] else believe me for the very works sake
[43:43] verily verily I say unto you he that
[43:45] believeth on me the works that I do
[43:47] shall he do also and greater works than
[43:51] these shall he do because I go under my
[43:54] father and whatsoever she ye shall ask
[43:57] in my name that will I do that the
[43:59] father may be glorified in the son
[44:01] I believe those words were a promise to
[44:04] the church that when God put his own
[44:06] life into the church he would manifest
[44:08] his own attributes in the church and the
[44:11] same thing many times we lose confidence
[44:13] and the fact that he is still Hebrews
[44:15] 13:8 he is still the same yesterday
[44:18] today and forever listen if he is able
[44:21] to heal people up at the camp if he is
[44:23] able to restore lost children up in
[44:26] Alaska if he's able to do all these
[44:28] things he's able to do it in Lula - he's
[44:31] able to do it because he's still the say
[44:33] he still Jehovah Jireh he's still the
[44:36] same so let's listen to what brother
[44:38] Branham said about in that day on
[44:39] Calvary about greater works
[44:41] he said now notice I appreciate
[44:44] whoever's doing the quotes by their
[44:45] y'all on the ball the greater works was
[44:48] to have the power in the church power in
[44:53] the church and listen that don't mean
[44:55] when you feel like you have power power
[44:58] is something that comes from confidence
[45:01] with God a revelation of who he is and a
[45:05] revelation comes from the word when the
[45:07] word is
[45:08] reveal to you that gives you confidence
[45:11] regardless of whether it's raining or
[45:13] sunny or whether you're in the inner
[45:14] court out of wherever you're standing
[45:16] your your your inner innermost being is
[45:20] in that Holy of Holies with God the
[45:23] greater works was to have the power in
[45:25] the church not only to heal the sick by
[45:27] prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to
[45:31] impart eternal life to believers the
[45:34] Holy Ghost was coming and given into the
[45:36] hands of the church to impart life oh
[45:38] that's what Calvary meant it took
[45:41] stooped degraded men and women and
[45:43] lifted them into a place to be sons and
[45:46] daughters of God to heal the sick and to
[45:49] impart eternal life by giving the Holy
[45:51] Ghost to obedient believers men who were
[45:54] once unbelievers be made believers and
[45:56] impart spiritual eternal life you know
[46:02] what that means
[46:02] that he wanted you to have a part to
[46:05] play in this he didn't want to just do
[46:07] it all himself and he didn't want to
[46:10] just let the church age messengers do it
[46:13] all themselves because under each church
[46:15] age messenger you would have the
[46:16] preaching of the gospel listen you could
[46:18] even have a little housewife preaching
[46:20] to her little children gathered around
[46:22] and she can impart eternal life to them
[46:25] it's not just the ministry of the
[46:27] ministry the ministry that is imparting
[46:29] life listen when you gather around and
[46:31] Bible studies in your home as I know you
[46:33] all do because I'm speaking positively
[46:35] I'm speaking confidently I know you do
[46:38] that because you're all Christians here
[46:40] and you want to raise your children up
[46:42] just like Abraham did God that is a
[46:44] scripture in the Bible that says God
[46:45] gave all of these promises to Abraham
[46:47] because he knew he would teach them to
[46:49] his children so when you gather all your
[46:52] little children around your knee like
[46:53] John Wesley's wife did when you gather
[46:56] them all around your knee you are
[46:57] imparting eternal life to them because
[46:59] it's passed down it's passed down from
[47:01] one believer to the next it's hand pass
[47:04] it like passing an actual torch because
[47:06] you are the light of the world you have
[47:09] that light on the inside and that light
[47:11] is passed from the one to the other by
[47:13] the words that you speak by the
[47:16] atmosphere that you create and you
[47:18] create an
[47:19] my sphere of worship I had an atmosphere
[47:21] of faith by the words that you speak you
[47:23] know brother Brown when he got into a
[47:25] meeting where that word was being spoken
[47:27] he began he could actually see that
[47:29] milkiness of faith milkiness of the
[47:32] people believing as they received the
[47:34] words that were spoken the word the word
[47:39] is what creates that atmosphere do you
[47:43] have confidence that that is what
[47:45] creates the atmosphere that's what
[47:48] that's what's such a stumbling block
[47:50] it's not such a stumbling stone almost
[47:52] to many people is that this word is the
[47:56] thing that will give you confidence and
[47:59] will trade it off so many times for
[48:01] something else we'll trade it off for
[48:04] the new spirit that God gives you he'll
[48:06] give you a new spirit he'll give you a
[48:09] new spirit but that's not the confidence
[48:10] here that's not the faith on the inside
[48:13] now it might feel good when we come to
[48:16] church and everything but when when you
[48:18] begin to look into the word and it
[48:20] begins to open up to you and you begin
[48:22] to see yourself in the scripture and
[48:24] identify yourself I see it it's almost
[48:28] hard to explain but when when God begins
[48:32] to reveal himself to you it's like the
[48:34] veil comes off of your eyes and you
[48:37] begin to see things as they really are I
[48:41] begin to look I like to read about and
[48:44] study on how other people got the new
[48:46] birth how other people's experience was
[48:48] and when you begin to look at Martin
[48:50] Luther and John Wesley's lives just for
[48:52] example you begin to look at how they
[48:54] had they had confidence in the word
[48:56] confidence in the word is what gave them
[48:58] brought them to a place of the new birth
[49:01] oh goodness lift up those dreary aliens
[49:07] it's not time to take your rest because
[49:17] when you look at how other people's
[49:19] experiences you can begin to compare
[49:22] their experience to yours and see if it
[49:24] matches up if compare and see if it
[49:27] matches up with the word you see Martin
[49:30] Luther and John Wesley they both they
[49:32] both
[49:32] came to thunderstorms Martin let Wesley
[49:35] on the owner road and John Wesley out on
[49:37] the ship and it was a big storm that
[49:39] rose up in both of their lives and in
[49:41] both of their lives they began to
[49:43] realize that they didn't have the
[49:44] confidence that they thought they did
[49:45] now in Martin Luther's case he was going
[49:48] down the road and the Lightning began to
[49:50] strike if it struck a big old tree right
[49:51] next to a kaboom and a my goodness he
[49:54] really he realized he began to cry out
[49:56] to God but he didn't know how to cry out
[49:58] too he was still all up in that that
[50:00] Catholic system so he began to call out
[50:02] the saint an and you see in that moment
[50:08] you know he was trying to do something
[50:10] he was trying to and that's how many of
[50:12] us do we try to do something in our own
[50:14] ability but you know when you begin to
[50:16] turn to the world of God that is where
[50:18] your confidence really comes from so you
[50:21] see when he got his confidence he was
[50:22] studying in the scripture and he began
[50:24] to look he was reading the Latin the
[50:26] Latin of that scripture in Habakkuk
[50:28] chapter 2 verse 4 that says behold his
[50:30] soul which has lifted up is not upright
[50:33] in him but the just shall live by his
[50:34] face and he began to look up the word
[50:38] just and meditate on that and and in the
[50:41] Latin that he was reading that the word
[50:43] was just if Akane
[50:45] that sounds like a big justification in
[50:49] the Latin they were translating a word
[50:51] that meant to make righteous by
[50:53] something the church gives you by
[50:55] something that you do but how many times
[50:57] you can beat yourself so about how many
[50:59] of novenas you can say but he began to
[51:01] look back in the original Greek and he
[51:04] read the word akio's and I might not
[51:07] even be pronouncing that right but it
[51:08] don't really matter because you see God
[51:10] was speaking to him as he looked into
[51:12] the word he looked into the word and
[51:15] began to open up to him that it said the
[51:17] original Greek translation meant to
[51:20] count righteousness in other words that
[51:22] you were righteous because God gave you
[51:25] his righteousness it was not something
[51:28] that you did it was something that he
[51:30] did and all of a sudden the word began
[51:33] to open up to him and maybe he didn't
[51:36] feel anything I don't know maybe he felt
[51:38] something but but yes something down on
[51:40] the inside was quick and a spark was lit
[51:42] and
[51:43] and it transformed the whole world and
[51:46] it began to reform the world by that
[51:47] little just that little revelation of
[51:49] what the new birth really is because the
[51:53] new birth is the justification of your
[51:55] soul that God has given you his
[51:58] righteousness you see you see how simple
[52:04] the new birth is see how simple faith in
[52:07] God is and and and look let's meditate
[52:09] on John Wesley for just a little bit as
[52:12] the time creeps around
[52:14] John Wesley there in that thunderstorm
[52:17] on the only ocean as the waves began to
[52:19] rock the boat and and the lightning was
[52:22] striking and he began a begun to look at
[52:24] those Moravian families and even the
[52:26] Moravian children and marvel at how even
[52:29] the children were not afraid they were
[52:30] like if God takes my life then I'm
[52:33] confident that my life is in a place
[52:36] where I'd know where I'm going I'm
[52:39] confident and the one that has redeemed
[52:41] me I'm confident that the price has been
[52:42] paid and he looked at them he looked at
[52:45] their faith and began to wonder that he
[52:47] have that same kind of faith you know
[52:52] when he got back to England after after
[52:54] going into the America you know he
[52:55] preached continued preaching even
[52:58] without the knew that he knew he didn't
[52:59] have the new birth if somebody said
[53:01] preach faith until you get it and then
[53:03] you can preach it cause you have it and
[53:05] he began to keep preaching faith and and
[53:07] he one day he began to meditate on the
[53:09] scripture and he began to look at
[53:11] scriptures like 2nd Peter chapter 1
[53:13] verse 4 that says whereby are given unto
[53:15] us exceeding great and precious promises
[53:18] that by these you might be partakers of
[53:21] the divine nature having escaped the
[53:24] corruption that is in the world through
[53:27] lust and he began to realize through the
[53:30] word through the promise of God that God
[53:33] had had made these promises to him that
[53:35] whereby God could give you the divine
[53:37] nature of God and his confidence was
[53:40] placed in the Word of God where his
[53:43] confidence previously had been placed in
[53:44] his own good works and just doing right
[53:46] and all those things I wonder tonight if
[53:48] many may be here could our confidence
[53:51] might be placed in things that we do
[53:53] good legalistic message believed in life
[53:56] where we don't the women are not cutting
[53:58] their hair and their their dress
[54:00] inappropriately maybe but yes something
[54:02] down on the inside you haven't quite
[54:04] opened up that door of your heart to let
[54:07] him down on the inside you haven't quite
[54:09] opened that door of faith to let him
[54:12] have complete dominion because you see
[54:14] as I began to meditate on confidence in
[54:17] the scripture and began to think about
[54:18] all these different Junction times there
[54:21] was always a program taught that there
[54:23] were three Exodus and in each of these
[54:25] Exodus is coming out and going into at
[54:28] each of these times there was always
[54:30] somebody that didn't have confidence
[54:32] there was always somebody that believed
[54:34] and you know what Brooke what God did
[54:36] well after he dealt with him after he he
[54:38] labored and was patient with him the
[54:41] Bible says rising up early speaking the
[54:43] word to them after dealing with him
[54:45] finally he would turn and go to a
[54:48] different group of people y'all all
[54:52] right you look like you're all right so
[54:57] I have confidence that you're all right
[55:00] and I'm just gonna breeze through this
[55:02] and try to get through this at numbers
[55:04] chapter 14 the Bible says that because
[55:07] all those men which have seen my glory
[55:09] that here we are in a Kadish Barnea and
[55:11] they're fixing to go over into the
[55:13] promised land
[55:14] just like we're fixing to go over into a
[55:17] body change all this the third Exodus so
[55:20] you come out and you've got to go into
[55:22] that each exodus is I mean but he said
[55:26] because all those men which have seen my
[55:28] glory and my miracles which I did in
[55:30] Egypt and in the wilderness effort and
[55:31] I've tempted to me now these ten times
[55:33] and have not hearken to my voice surely
[55:36] they shall not see the land which I
[55:39] swear under their fathers neither shall
[55:41] any of them that provoked me see it but
[55:45] my servant Caleb because he had another
[55:47] spirit with him and has followed me
[55:49] fully him will I bring into the land
[55:52] wherein he went and his seed shall
[55:54] possess it and so do you see what
[55:58] happened was they that generation they
[56:00] failed to have confidence that God was
[56:03] able to take them over into the Promised
[56:05] Land so
[56:06] I began to turn to a younger generation
[56:09] he began to take turn to a group of
[56:12] people including Caleb that he knew
[56:15] would have confidence that he could take
[56:17] them over let's look at the third Exodus
[56:20] in Acts chapter 13 46 or the second
[56:23] Exodus I'm sorry let me just give an
[56:25] overview of this because I gave it a
[56:26] little Bible study to my kids the other
[56:28] night on that what the three Exodus is
[56:30] were because a need that came out of
[56:32] Egypt and went to the promised land they
[56:34] came out and went into and then they
[56:37] came out of the old tested that the the
[56:39] Pharisee achill and sad you see ideas
[56:41] and they went into the promise of the
[56:43] new birth in the second Exodus and the
[56:45] third Exodus we come out of the the the
[56:48] the ideas and the the the denominational
[56:52] ideas of the seven churches and we go
[56:54] into the promise of the Son of Man into
[56:56] the message into the capstone revelation
[56:59] into a body change but you see in each
[57:02] of these Exodus ha's there was somebody
[57:04] that was left behind because they did
[57:06] not have confidence in the revelation of
[57:09] their day in Acts chapter 13 verse 46 it
[57:15] says then Paul and Barnabas blacks bold
[57:18] and said it was necessary that the Word
[57:19] of God should first have been spoken to
[57:22] you but seeing you put it from you and
[57:24] judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
[57:26] life lo we turn to the Gentiles so
[57:31] they're in the second Exodus God turned
[57:34] from these people hood and we know the
[57:36] Jews were blinded in the whole story
[57:37] behind that but they yet they could not
[57:39] lay hold to confidence in the scripture
[57:42] confidence that God was able to give
[57:45] them the new birth is what it was and so
[57:47] God turned it to the Gentiles and then
[57:51] in the third Exodus in Revelation you
[57:53] say well where is attorney where is a
[57:55] turning away in this day in Revelation
[57:57] chapter 3 15 to 16 he said I know thy
[58:01] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[58:03] I would thou wert cold or hot so then
[58:06] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[58:09] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[58:12] mouth because you say and you see in
[58:15] this day God has poured out everything
[58:18] to us he's
[58:19] giving us the full revelation of the
[58:21] word and yet you see in many message
[58:24] churches even in many churches people
[58:26] are lukewarm and they won't they won't
[58:28] go and pour through the scripture like
[58:30] the brains they won't get into the
[58:33] scripture and you see maybe maybe here's
[58:36] where the nut does the sword that's
[58:38] there gets to slicing as you see ones
[58:41] come out after service and they go out
[58:43] into the parking lot maybe and they
[58:45] begin to say well I don't even halfway
[58:46] understanding me the thing that's being
[58:48] spoken out I don't even oh I I'll tell
[58:51] you what I begin to be grieved when I
[58:53] hear things because listen Wade has laid
[58:56] out the seven seals laid it out so even
[58:59] a brain-dead person if we could begin to
[59:01] understand the seven seals you could
[59:04] just about be laying there as an invalid
[59:06] and yeah and then you you won't go and
[59:08] study and you won't go read and you
[59:09] won't go find out what it says and then
[59:12] you go out into the park come out and
[59:13] begin to say I can barely keep I don't
[59:15] know what's going on I don't know who to
[59:17] believe I don't know if this is
[59:18] something that that Levi or or our
[59:20] brother Donny or whoever is preaching I
[59:22] don't know what the truth is and you
[59:24] begin to wonder listen it's a time we're
[59:26] like a Katie's bar near where the
[59:28] ministers Joshua and Caleb began to tear
[59:30] their garments it's a time when you
[59:32] begin to wonder other people catching
[59:34] the revelation of the hour
[59:35] or are they gonna just be left behind is
[59:38] God gonna turn and just spew them out of
[59:40] their mouth listen I know listen let's
[59:44] be frank here I believe that there are
[59:46] the foolish virgin is going to come out
[59:48] of many message churches because in many
[59:51] message churches people are foolish
[59:53] people of virgin City and churches
[59:55] untainted by the things of the world
[59:57] untainted by the denominational ideas
[1:00:00] but they if they sit in the church and
[1:00:02] they believe they're okay and they won't
[1:00:04] go on to receive the confidence of the
[1:00:06] word for their day they've lost
[1:00:08] confidence in the ministry they lost
[1:00:10] confidence in the man behind the pulpit
[1:00:12] they've heard almost lost confidence in
[1:00:14] the word that's been delivered to them
[1:00:16] and they say well I don't even know I
[1:00:18] barely even know I don't know what the
[1:00:20] message is about I don't know what's
[1:00:22] about so and without knowing what's it
[1:00:24] about what all that I'm left to do is
[1:00:27] return back
[1:00:31] just kind of symbols of my face just
[1:00:34] kind of artifacts of my fate like that
[1:00:36] like the Catholics were you'd they would
[1:00:38] they would maybe cling a whole to to
[1:00:41] like a nail that they thought came from
[1:00:43] Jesus or cling to like the Shroud of
[1:00:47] Turin or something and now listen you
[1:00:50] can make anything a relic you can make
[1:00:52] listen I don't even Li listen to tapes
[1:00:54] anymore because I don't have tapes tapes
[1:00:57] or a thing of two or three generations
[1:01:00] ago not not two or three generations
[1:01:02] come on brother bar tapes tapes you're a
[1:01:06] thing of ten 20 years ago we don't
[1:01:08] listen to tapes anymore we've got it on
[1:01:09] our phones but yeah you can put that up
[1:01:12] in your hole you could put it on your
[1:01:13] wall and hang it on your wall and say
[1:01:15] look at me I have confidence I have
[1:01:17] confidence in this relic and you can
[1:01:20] make it a relic you can make it a
[1:01:22] relative cuz it's hanging on your wall
[1:01:23] and you put your confidence in that
[1:01:26] thing without receiving the revelation
[1:01:28] of Jesus Christ in your life you can
[1:01:31] even make you can even make the prophet
[1:01:34] of God something that you put I believe
[1:01:36] that God sent a prophet that's all well
[1:01:39] and good and that's maybe something that
[1:01:40] we preached about twenty or thirty years
[1:01:42] ago but it's time for you to receive the
[1:01:44] revelation that that prophet priest it's
[1:01:47] time to you for you to get into the
[1:01:49] message and find out the things that he
[1:01:51] spoke about so that you might have
[1:01:53] confidence because listen listen just
[1:01:56] sitting around and clapping about that
[1:01:58] God sent a prophet will not give you
[1:02:00] confidence just sitting around and
[1:02:03] saying that I believe that that we are
[1:02:05] sitting around and saying that that
[1:02:07] we're in a particular place and like the
[1:02:09] scripture that brother Wade ready if
[1:02:11] they say go into the desert or go over
[1:02:12] here don't believe them
[1:02:14] because you know where the Word of God
[1:02:16] is you have confidence that he has in
[1:02:19] you and you the word is nigh you even in
[1:02:22] your mouth the words that the prophets
[1:02:25] spoke are now in your mouth and you have
[1:02:28] the ability to speak them to your family
[1:02:31] to the to your co-workers to the people
[1:02:33] that you walk with and talk with to
[1:02:36] listen the Word of God is not just in
[1:02:39] the ministry's mouth
[1:02:41] the Word of God is and that I believe is
[1:02:44] the mystery of this day
[1:02:46] the mystery that the ministers are
[1:02:49] preaching is that Christ is in union
[1:02:51] Christ the hope of glory is in here let
[1:02:59] me let me read that quote my goodness
[1:03:02] Tom's running away with me listen let's
[1:03:07] go to quote number 15 and you know I'll
[1:03:10] try to wrap it up here and adoption
[1:03:15] number four and he said now he said and
[1:03:19] this is I'm gonna get brother Louise
[1:03:21] credit for this because he shared this
[1:03:22] quote he said you don't have to give me
[1:03:24] credit for finding this but that this is
[1:03:27] a fantastic quote and I'm using this
[1:03:29] quote you can use it again brother Lewis
[1:03:31] but I'm gonna use it for now he said now
[1:03:35] he said he he made known to us the
[1:03:38] mystery get the Holy Spirit on you
[1:03:41] sometime and start running that and just
[1:03:43] watch how it goes start running that if
[1:03:45] you sit down with their message software
[1:03:47] and just type in the mystery and see
[1:03:50] what it says run that through the
[1:03:52] message and see what it comes back with
[1:03:54] this afternoon I had all about 30
[1:03:57] minutes to study just to look the lesson
[1:03:59] over maybe not I'll say half of that 15
[1:04:01] minutes between the times and I got to
[1:04:03] running and I thought the mystery how
[1:04:06] mysterious and the scripture packed me
[1:04:10] back into the Old Testament then back
[1:04:12] over to the New Testament Todd something
[1:04:14] together see the mystery of his coming
[1:04:16] the mystery of his will the mystery of
[1:04:18] us sitting together remember it cannot
[1:04:20] be taught in any seminary it's a mystery
[1:04:23] you cannot know it by education by
[1:04:25] theology it's a mystery that's been
[1:04:28] hidden since the foundation of the world
[1:04:31] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:04:34] sons of God now listen I believe a
[1:04:37] minister should be plain so the way you
[1:04:39] don't leave when you leave you don't
[1:04:40] wonder what I believe because I believe
[1:04:42] I believe that this is why God gave the
[1:04:46] preach the preaching of the gospel is to
[1:04:48] reveal the mystery and so if you just
[1:04:51] sit at home this might stir up some
[1:04:53] controversy whatever
[1:04:54] say it anyway if you just sit at home
[1:04:57] and listening to the tapes you are
[1:04:59] missing the mystery you're in danger of
[1:05:02] missing the mystery the mist what is the
[1:05:05] mystery you say oh well I don't somebody
[1:05:07] somebody was telling my kids the other
[1:05:09] day well you know what if you want to
[1:05:11] sit at home and listening tapes that's
[1:05:12] fine
[1:05:13] or if you want to come to church that's
[1:05:14] fine just whatever you do and you don't
[1:05:17] have any there's nothing to stand on I
[1:05:19] believe when the enemy comes in like a
[1:05:21] flood God will raise up a standard we've
[1:05:23] got to have a standard and the standard
[1:05:26] is his word and the word says come to
[1:05:28] church because that's where the
[1:05:30] preaching of the gospel is that's where
[1:05:32] the preaching of the mystery is what is
[1:05:35] the mystery it seems all very mysterious
[1:05:38] but you know if you go back to
[1:05:40] Colossians 1:26 27 you'll find out what
[1:05:43] the mystery is the mystery that has been
[1:05:46] hidden from ages and from ages and and
[1:05:49] is now revealed to the Gentiles but you
[1:05:55] know so many people fail to see what
[1:05:58] that mystery is and even a lot of times
[1:06:00] when the mystery is preached you don't
[1:06:03] have confidence in the ministry you
[1:06:04] don't have confidence in the word and
[1:06:06] your eyes are veiled over and you fail
[1:06:08] to see what the mystery is the mystery
[1:06:11] of Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:06:14] the mystery is that God is in you that
[1:06:17] you are the fulfillment of the entire
[1:06:20] New Testament
[1:06:22] just like Jesus was the fulfillment of
[1:06:24] the Old Testament the life of Christ in
[1:06:27] you is the fulfillment of the New
[1:06:28] Testament and God is putting his life in
[1:06:31] you just like his life was in himself as
[1:06:34] he walked the shores of Galilee the life
[1:06:37] of God in the believers in the church
[1:06:39] and that life is what will give you
[1:06:42] confidence that life is what will take
[1:06:45] you in a rapture because God is going to
[1:06:47] take his own life in the rapture God is
[1:06:50] going to take his own word in the
[1:06:51] rapture and you have eaten the word and
[1:06:54] you have received it until you have
[1:06:55] become the word and that's why that's
[1:06:58] why you know many ministers they be
[1:06:59] there fighting against this thing that I
[1:07:02] don't need to come to church and it's
[1:07:03] not because we don't we're not balanced
[1:07:07] I'm so tired of hearing that we're not
[1:07:08] ballasts when I'll have a balanced view
[1:07:11] of it the reason is because we want
[1:07:14] people to see the mystery listen if you
[1:07:18] have these virtues you can see afar off
[1:07:20] and you can see what's happening in the
[1:07:22] church you can see what's taking place
[1:07:24] in the people's lives and you can see
[1:07:26] that there's a confidence lacking and
[1:07:28] usually there's something in you
[1:07:29] groaning and crying out believe God
[1:07:32] believe the Word of God allow God to
[1:07:35] have preeminence in your life so that
[1:07:37] this mystery can be unfolded in you the
[1:07:40] mystery is not God sent a prophet that's
[1:07:43] part of the mystery because God's had to
[1:07:45] send a prophet so that you could hear
[1:07:47] the prophets message the mystery is that
[1:07:51] God is in you you know you look back
[1:07:59] into the scripture and think about and
[1:08:00] I'm trying to close here y'all y'all
[1:08:02] bear with me just for a little bit
[1:08:03] longer I know it's Wednesday night but I
[1:08:06] believe that you travel for a long way
[1:08:08] to hear the word tonight and so my goal
[1:08:10] is to feed you a little bit well you
[1:08:12] read back in John chapter one when when
[1:08:15] the disciple there was two disciples
[1:08:16] with John the one that was to introduce
[1:08:19] the Son of Man there were two disciples
[1:08:22] with John and John said there goes the
[1:08:25] Son of Man one of them was Andrew and we
[1:08:26] don't know the name of the other and
[1:08:28] Andrew said whom there goes the son of
[1:08:32] man and he didn't he didn't just discard
[1:08:35] what the prophets said that's what
[1:08:37] everybody said the fivefold ministry is
[1:08:38] saying we know something more than then
[1:08:41] the elijah ministry no he turned to he
[1:08:46] turned to receive the son of man he
[1:08:50] turned after the son of man and you see
[1:08:53] that's the same thing that elijah has
[1:08:55] done in this day he brought a message to
[1:08:59] speak the word that the son of man would
[1:09:02] be made manifest again and if you just
[1:09:06] have your eyes still on the prophet I
[1:09:08] believe God sent a prophet and I intent
[1:09:09] we like we love to tell all the stories
[1:09:11] and we love to all the different things
[1:09:13] about God in that manifesting himself in
[1:09:16] the Prophet the visions
[1:09:18] but he preached a message he preached a
[1:09:21] message to reveal the Son of man and
[1:09:24] where is the Son of Man the Prophet is
[1:09:27] not on earth today and John was taken
[1:09:30] off the earth when the Son of Man was
[1:09:32] being revealed the Prophet is not on
[1:09:35] earth where is the Son of Man the Son of
[1:09:37] Man is in you the Son of Man is being
[1:09:41] revealed in you not just a particular
[1:09:42] man not just one individual preacher not
[1:09:45] just not just one individual person but
[1:09:48] the bride all around the world is the
[1:09:51] son of man God is revealing himself in
[1:09:53] you and that is the mystery that's the
[1:09:56] thing you'll miss by just sitting home
[1:09:58] and listening to the tapes and you might
[1:10:00] you'll say well now I hear now I know it
[1:10:02] but you've got to go through and
[1:10:04] experience your own self and that's what
[1:10:08] the fullest virgin do they wait until
[1:10:11] it's too late and then they go to get
[1:10:13] all in the lab but it's too late it's
[1:10:15] too late because the bride has already
[1:10:18] come through an experience they've
[1:10:20] already gone through a growth process
[1:10:21] they've already come through all of this
[1:10:23] building up time they've already come
[1:10:25] through receiving the son of man
[1:10:26] revelation they've struggled and they've
[1:10:29] strived to receive that capstone
[1:10:30] revelation so that that word could be
[1:10:33] produced in their lives oh god I hope
[1:10:37] it's not too late friends I hope it's
[1:10:39] not too late because so many have
[1:10:41] squandered this time and God now will
[1:10:44] turn he's turning and he's saying well
[1:10:46] you've been too lukewarm all this time
[1:10:48] you didn't you didn't get into the
[1:10:50] message you didn't struggle and strive
[1:10:52] you didn't receive it it's not about
[1:10:55] being balanced freedom it's about
[1:10:57] understanding the mystery of the day
[1:11:00] it's about understanding the mystery and
[1:11:03] you cannot receive the mystery I believe
[1:11:05] that if you look around and observe it
[1:11:07] as a parent they're just sitting home
[1:11:10] and tapes
[1:11:10] listening to tapes will not give you
[1:11:13] confidence in that mystery and maybe the
[1:11:17] maybe this will stir up controversy or
[1:11:20] whatever but I believe the old testing
[1:11:21] at Hebrews 11 the Hebrews 11 Saints were
[1:11:25] well a crack weighted with controversy
[1:11:27] Daniel was well acquainted with
[1:11:29] controversy when he threw his window
[1:11:31] when it was thrown in the lion's den the
[1:11:33] three Hebrew children were
[1:11:34] well-acquainted with controversy when
[1:11:36] they would not bow to the image of the
[1:11:38] Prophet they would not worship the
[1:11:41] Prophet they would not worship the image
[1:11:43] that had been erected because they knew
[1:11:46] their God they had confidence in their
[1:11:48] God and they had confidence in the
[1:11:50] revelation for their day I'm trying to
[1:11:58] wander i'ma just speak on a few more
[1:12:01] things because let's see that's what the
[1:12:03] statue of a perfect man is when God puts
[1:12:05] his confidence in you he wants you to
[1:12:07] realize that God is confident in you and
[1:12:11] he begins to work on you and give you
[1:12:13] trials and things as you grow up and and
[1:12:16] the grace of God and you begin to build
[1:12:19] one thing gets built on the other until
[1:12:22] God is looking at you and you see I I
[1:12:26] began to read scriptures or read quotes
[1:12:28] the things that brother have said about
[1:12:30] why gifts are not manifest in the church
[1:12:32] today do you realize the power that God
[1:12:35] has given us the power of the spoken
[1:12:38] word brother have said if God just
[1:12:40] unleashed every if he's like unleashed
[1:12:43] everything that was inhibiting you you
[1:12:45] could go create a world you could speak
[1:12:48] a world into existence and into
[1:12:50] existence you began to think that is a
[1:12:53] lot of power and before you give that
[1:12:56] kind of power to somebody before you let
[1:12:59] them have all that free reign and we'll
[1:13:03] talk about the gifts too before you let
[1:13:05] these gifts unloose in the Church of
[1:13:07] speaking in tongues of all these
[1:13:10] different things you want to make sure
[1:13:11] that the people know how to use it that
[1:13:17] they're nice and mature exactly because
[1:13:20] you don't you don't want to give a
[1:13:21] chainsaw into the hand of a little baby
[1:13:23] and have it running around cutting
[1:13:24] things or whatever but you want to make
[1:13:26] sure that they're confident first and so
[1:13:29] you got to test them and try them you
[1:13:31] got to put them through some things and
[1:13:32] that's what many times it's so hard
[1:13:34] about being a Christian as you you feel
[1:13:37] like maybe God has left you especially
[1:13:39] maybe out right after receiving the new
[1:13:41] birth
[1:13:42] just like when G
[1:13:43] when the spirit came upon Jesus on the
[1:13:45] River Jordan right after that he was he
[1:13:47] was into the wilderness being tempted by
[1:13:49] the devil just after God does something
[1:13:51] for you then he'll many times the devil
[1:13:54] begins to attack you and try you just
[1:13:56] after you believe her healing it seems
[1:13:57] like you're getting sicker all the time
[1:13:59] but just have confidence have faith in
[1:14:01] the Word of God and God will bring his
[1:14:03] word to pass and I'm gonna end right
[1:14:06] there cuz I know it's good late and
[1:14:08] everything I feel like I could probably
[1:14:09] go on for another two hours I don't want
[1:14:13] to scare anybody so go the musicians can
[1:14:15] go ahead and come forward but you know
[1:14:17] you know many times brother Brown talked
[1:14:18] about I'm just gonna finish on these as
[1:14:20] they come forward we already talked
[1:14:22] about how many times you you begin to
[1:14:25] stray away you begin to forget what your
[1:14:28] confidence is and he told that story of
[1:14:30] that down as Sydney as they were
[1:14:32] building that bridge that famous bridge
[1:14:34] over the Sydney Harbour and they look
[1:14:36] for different ones that could build it
[1:14:37] and finally they found a man that said I
[1:14:39] can do it but we got a dig we got a dig
[1:14:42] way and the way brother Brent said it we
[1:14:43] got it with dig way way way way way way
[1:14:47] down down all the way until they got to
[1:14:51] bedrock and that's how you find
[1:14:53] confidence is when you get when you get
[1:14:55] when you go home and you say well I'm
[1:14:57] just going to dig through all this stuff
[1:14:59] in my house I'm gonna at this time for a
[1:15:01] sanctified sanctifying it's time for a
[1:15:04] purging I'm getting rid of all the stuff
[1:15:06] that shouldn't be here and you dig down
[1:15:08] until you find confidence with God
[1:15:10] remember that story that brother Brian
[1:15:14] told about well it was in the Bible in
[1:15:17] 2nd Kings chapter 3 but there's three
[1:15:19] kings that way they went up against
[1:15:21] against I believe it was Moab and they
[1:15:23] went seven days seven days out into eat
[1:15:26] him out into the wilderness leaving and
[1:15:28] they and they ran out of water and they
[1:15:30] begin to they began to cry out for God
[1:15:32] is God gonna is God still able to
[1:15:35] deliver us and Jehoshaphat sent for the
[1:15:38] for the prophet Elijah and Elijah and
[1:15:41] Elisha came and he said he told him you
[1:15:44] know brother Branham the way brother
[1:15:45] Browns explains this and he said it was
[1:15:48] revealed to Elisha that the place where
[1:15:51] they were owned was the same place where
[1:15:53] when the Israelites were in Egypt the
[1:15:56] Moses had come down off of the off of
[1:15:59] the mountain and instead of smiting the
[1:16:01] children of Israel he smoked that rock
[1:16:03] and out from that rock came gushing
[1:16:05] water in that same place now they were
[1:16:07] and that out in the middle of the
[1:16:10] wilderness of eat up eat him and and
[1:16:12] Elijah began to tell them the prophet of
[1:16:14] God told him if you want water
[1:16:16] if you won't if you want to win this
[1:16:18] battle you got to dig and they began to
[1:16:21] dig they began to dig those dishes so
[1:16:23] you know many times in life you get to a
[1:16:25] place where you feel like you've been
[1:16:27] left alone that nobody loves you that
[1:16:29] nobody cares for you that God is left
[1:16:31] left you all alone you begin to lose
[1:16:33] confidence at the place where you are
[1:16:35] you begin to lose confidence that God is
[1:16:37] still on your side and brother round
[1:16:39] taught us the antidote for that the
[1:16:41] remedy for that is to begin to dig so
[1:16:45] let's begin to dig if you have something
[1:16:47] in your life it's time to get it out of
[1:16:49] the way dig so many times you've got a
[1:16:52] you got a dig you got to dig through the
[1:16:54] naysayers you got to dig through people
[1:16:56] who say well they're not preaching right
[1:16:57] you got to dig through all the things
[1:16:59] they're not believing right this those
[1:17:01] people are crazy to believe in a baptism
[1:17:03] of the Holy Ghost they're they're crazy
[1:17:05] to believe that God is still able to
[1:17:07] deliver and heal there's you got to dig
[1:17:09] through all that but that's how you get
[1:17:11] confidence Saints and I am confident in
[1:17:14] the Word of God and I'm confident in you
[1:17:17] I'm confident and the church that we
[1:17:20] have and I'm a believer
