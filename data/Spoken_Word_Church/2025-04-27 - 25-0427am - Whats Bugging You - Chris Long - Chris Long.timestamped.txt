[0:00] I'll praise him wherever I
[0:04] can. I'll praise him for his
[0:09] love surrounds me like a
[0:15] sea. I'll praise the
[0:18] name of Jesus. Lift up the
[0:23] name of Jesus. For the
[0:28] name of Jesus lifted me wherever I go.
[0:34] Oh, wherever I
[0:37] go, I'll praise him whenever I
[0:41] can. And I'll praise him for him.
[0:46] Love surrounds me like a sea.
[0:53] I'll praise the
[0:56] name of Jesus. Lift up the
[1:00] name of Jesus. For the
[1:05] name of Jesus lifted me.
[1:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I was
[1:16] thinking of a scripture. James 4:7. We
[1:19] often says resist the devil and he will
[1:23] flee from me. But the scripture says
[1:25] first submit yourselves unto God
[1:30] and the devil will flee from you. Amen.
[1:32] So you got something out front to resist
[1:35] with when you take God.
[1:39] Amen.
[1:41] We're going to read this morning
[1:43] from Psalms 42 verse
[1:47] 1- 11. Let us pray first. Lord Jesus, we
[1:53] thank you this morning for this
[1:55] opportunity that we have to come
[1:56] together to worship. Father, let us
[1:59] forget about all things that hinder us
[2:02] or turn us away from the word of God.
[2:05] For your prophet told us to stay out of
[2:07] the ball ballpark of Satan for he's
[2:10] control of that. Lord, let us walk
[2:13] before Jesus and follow his way for he
[2:16] would lead us and guide us into all
[2:17] truth and understanding. So, Father, if
[2:20] there be any here, Lord, with problems
[2:24] of sickness in the body spirit, Lord, we
[2:27] pray that you would take it away. In
[2:30] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:51] Psalm 42 verse one. As the heart panth
[2:56] the waterbrook, so panth my soul after
[2:59] thee, oh God.
[3:01] My soul thirstes for God, for the living
[3:04] God. When shall I come and appear before
[3:08] God? My tears have been my meat day and
[3:12] night, while they continually say unto
[3:16] me, where is thy God?
[3:19] I remember these things. I pour out my
[3:22] soul in me. For I have gone with the
[3:25] multitude. I went with them to the house
[3:28] of God with the voice of joy and praise
[3:32] with the multitude that kept holy.
[3:36] Why art thou cast down, oh my soul, and
[3:39] why art thou disqued in me? Hope thou in
[3:43] God, for I shall yet praise him for the
[3:46] help of his countenance.
[3:50] Oh my God, my soul is cast down within
[3:53] me. Therefore will I remember thee from
[3:56] the land of Jordan and
[3:59] from the hills of
[4:02] the deep callth unto the deep of the
[4:06] noise of thy water spout. All thy ways
[4:10] they they build are gone over me.
[4:15] The Lord will command his loving
[4:17] kindness in the day and in the night his
[4:21] song shall be with me and my pray.
[4:27] I will say unto God, my rock, why art
[4:31] thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning
[4:34] because of thy oppression of the enemy?
[4:43] enemies daily.
[4:48] Why art thou cast down, oh my soul, and
[4:52] why it is within me? Hope thou in God
[4:57] for I shall yet praise him who is the
[5:01] health of my countenance and my God.
[5:05] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[5:07] Amen.
[5:19] Amen. I believe each of us can say this
[5:22] morning, he truly is their help. Amen.
[5:24] He is our strength, our rock. And
[5:28] there's such a deep that cries out.
[5:30] Sometimes you go for a while and there
[5:32] just something a deeper hunger that
[5:34] wants more of him. And it's him calling
[5:37] out to him through you. And it's such a
[5:39] beautiful picture of redemption. Brother
[5:41] Kern, would you come this morning and
[5:43] take up our ties and offering
[6:06] I want my
[6:09] We
[6:33] pray.
[6:35] Amen.
[6:40] Amen. I don't know about you, but
[6:42] sometimes you just long for that
[6:45] resurrection. There's a time where you
[6:47] just want to leave this world to see the
[6:49] ones who went on and get ready to meet
[6:51] him in the air. Amen. Some glad morning
[6:55] we shall see Jesus in the air coming
[7:00] after you and me. Joy is to share.
[7:05] All rejoice and there will be when the
[7:08] saints
[7:10] arise headed for that
[7:13] jubilee under in the
[7:15] sky. Oh, one
[7:18] singing. Oh, what shout it on that happy
[7:23] morning when we all shall rise and know
[7:28] what
[7:29] glory. Hallelujah.
[7:33] When we meet our blessed savior in the
[7:38] sky. Seems that now I almost see all the
[7:43] seated rising for that you believe.
[7:48] That's amen. In the twinkling of an eye
[7:53] change with him to
[7:54] be all the living saints to fly to that
[7:59] you believe.

[11:38] Some folks may

[11:57] But as for
[11:59] me, oh, I'll take God's
[12:05] heart. My God is real. For I can feel

[14:47] real God that speaks back and guides us
[14:50] by his spirit. Amen. Let's sing that uh
[14:53] song. How great is our God? We'll sing
[14:57] this song
[14:58] before Wade comes up. Do you believe
[15:01] your God is great this morning? We know
[15:04] he's a God that knows our life, our end,
[15:06] our beginning, and all that we're here.
[15:09] But, you know, God's really been dealing
[15:11] with me lately on purpose. What is your
[15:13] purpose here? You know, there's a
[15:16] brother that said something a couple of
[15:18] weeks ago about the difference between
[15:20] happiness and joy. And there's a lot of
[15:22] happy moments we have in our life. They
[15:24] come and go, but the joy of the Lord,
[15:27] that's our strength. that never changes
[15:31] and that gives you purpose when things
[15:33] in life don't go your way and and you
[15:35] just don't know what to do and you just
[15:37] fall to your knees and cry out. That joy
[15:39] of the Lord keeps you. When brother
[15:41] Brandham went through the hard trials,
[15:43] he said, "I didn't keep myself. It was
[15:45] him that kept me." And that's what's
[15:47] keeping us every day in his presence.
[15:51] How
[15:53] great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How
[15:59] great is our
[16:02] God? I'll sing. How
[16:05] great, how
[16:08] great is our
[16:11] [Music]
[16:13] God. Oh, how
[16:17] great is our
[16:19] God. Sing with me. How
[16:23] great is our God. You know, we see how
[16:29] great, how

[16:37] God. Oh, the splender of the
[16:43] King. Oh, he's clothed in
[16:48] majesty. Let all the earth
[16:51] rejoice. Let all the earth rejoice.
[16:57] He wraps himself in
[17:02] light and darkness tries to hide and
[17:07] trembles at all that voice trembles at
[17:11] the
[17:13] voice. How
[17:15] great is our
[17:18] God? Sing with me. How
[17:21] great is God. Is he great this morning?
[17:26] How
[17:28] great, how
[17:30] great is our God. Oh, sing it with all
[17:34] your heart. And

[18:11] beginning and the end. The beginning and
[18:16] the end.
[18:18] The God and three are one. Oh, great
[18:24] revelation. Father, spirit and
[18:28] son. The lion and the lamb. The lion and
[18:33] the lamb. I'm singing. How

[28:31] Stay right there because it's an eternal
[28:35] word. Amen. So, if you'll go to the book
[28:38] of Joel,
[28:40] the title of the message this morning,
[28:42] you think it's going to be weird, but I
[28:44] could have gave it something plainer,
[28:46] but I want to I want to I want to ask
[28:47] you a question. The title is, "What's
[28:49] bugging you?"
[28:52] Okay. You might think that's a Maybe I
[28:55] just gave it that to get a giggle out of
[28:57] you, but really there's more to it than
[29:00] that. Okay. Amen. So, let's get into
[29:02] God's word this morning. You got Joel
[29:03] chapter 1. I want to read verses 1-4 to
[29:07] begin. The word of the Lord that came to
[29:09] Joel the son of
[29:11] Pthe. Hear this, ye old men. And give
[29:16] ear, oh ye inhabitants of the land. Hath
[29:18] this been in your days? Or even in the
[29:21] days of your fathers?
[29:23] Tell ye your children of it, and let
[29:26] your children tell their children, and
[29:28] their children another generation.
[29:32] That which the palmer worm hath left
[29:35] hath the locust eaten. And that which
[29:37] the locust hath left hath the cankerworm
[29:40] eaten, and that which the canker worm
[29:43] hath left, hath the caterpillar eaten.
[29:46] Now, I want you to drop down to verse
[29:47] 10. Of course, reading the entire
[29:49] scripture is fine, but for the sake of
[29:50] time, verse 10, the field is
[29:53] wasted, the land mourneth, brother. For
[29:56] the corn is wasted, the new wine is
[29:59] dried up, the oil languisheth. Now, if
[30:04] you catch the types here, brother. Amen.
[30:07] Yes, sir. Be ye ashamed, oh ye husband
[30:10] men, howl. Oh ye vine dressers, for the
[30:13] wheat and for the barley, because the
[30:15] harvest of the field is perished,
[30:18] my the vine is dried up, and the fig
[30:21] tree languisheth. The pomegranate tree,
[30:24] the palm tree, also the apple tree, even
[30:27] all the trees of the field are withered
[30:28] because joy is withered
[30:32] away from the sons of men. Right? Let's
[30:36] pray. Father,
[30:40] there are so many things, Lord, in in
[30:43] the word of God that pertain to every
[30:47] hour that has come past us,
[30:50] Lord. But, Father, today you have
[30:54] informed a
[30:56] people. You have raised up a group of
[30:59] people, Lord, here and there, Father.
[31:01] Yeah. Who will endeavor to take you at
[31:05] your word. Amen. And every word of it,
[31:09] Lord, realizing that all scripture and
[31:12] prophecy is compound, Father, this was
[31:15] not just something spoken, Father, in
[31:19] the days of Joel, for the days of Joel,
[31:21] Lord, but it was prophecy, Father.
[31:25] We love you for it, Lord, because it is
[31:27] a prophetic group that gathers here this
[31:30] morning, Father, to receive
[31:33] spiritual food in due season.
[31:36] Help us now I pray Lord each and every
[31:38] one of us let us be attentive father to
[31:41] your
[31:42] word I pray that the spirit father the
[31:46] holy spirit that authored the word
[31:48] father would become the anchor of our
[31:51] hearts it's for your honor and your
[31:54] glory that we ask and pray lord in Jesus
[31:57] name amen go bless you may be seated now
[32:02] I don't know if you I if you recognize
[32:05] some of these things, but I want to
[32:08] start off slow. Uh I I've been given to
[32:12] understand that things have changed
[32:13] since the last time I was here, and that
[32:15] is that you just have one long service.
[32:22] Not too long services,
[32:27] long service. Well, every service for me
[32:29] is
[32:30] long. Every day is long.
[32:34] I didn't make it that way. I was born
[32:36] that way. But again, I'm only using
[32:41] these references so that you'll catch
[32:43] Amen. what's going on. Right, brother.
[32:46] Okay. I'm going to take my time. Amen.
[32:49] I'm going to I told my wife I'm going to
[32:51] throw her down into granny gear this
[32:53] morning. I'm just going to pull out on
[32:55] the throttle and let it move along as
[32:58] far as it'll go until we run out of gas.
[33:03] Now again, I'm reiterating this so that
[33:06] you'll
[33:07] catch what where I where I I'm coming
[33:11] from and where I want you to go with
[33:14] me. And that's I I'm using a Scullfield
[33:18] Bible. I'm not promoting it. So don't
[33:20] nobody think that. But but again,
[33:25] this is the book of Joel.
[33:27] The book of Joel was was authored
[33:30] approximately 800 BC.
[33:34] Right
[33:37] now, chapter one, there's a subheading,
[33:40] the plague of insects.
[33:43] It says introduction.
[33:46] Then you get down a little further and
[33:48] it says the desolation of the
[33:50] land. And a little further down between
[33:53] 14 and 15, the plague of insects. Listen
[33:57] now. A type of the day of the Lord.
[34:02] That's why I'm reading this to emphasize
[34:04] it's not just 800 BC. Now, this is
[34:08] prophetic and it's being broadcast. It
[34:12] was spoken through the mouth of Joel
[34:15] by God for a future time.
[34:19] Yes, it was happening then, but it was
[34:23] mis or not understood yet. All right?
[34:27] Because the prophets of old were moved
[34:30] by the spirit of God to just be used as
[34:34] a mouthpiece.
[34:36] Generally, the prophets did not record
[34:39] or write down their own sayings. They
[34:42] were in a realm where often times, if
[34:45] you've ever heard the prophet on tape,
[34:47] he would say, "Did I say that?" Yes. Are
[34:51] you the patient?
[34:53] Is that true? Because he was being used
[34:57] as somewhat of a mechanism to speak like
[35:00] Joel here.
[35:02] And so most of the prophets would get
[35:05] under that inspiration like a preacher
[35:07] should and like the hearer of the word
[35:09] should and they begin to be used by the
[35:13] spirit of
[35:15] God to move forward in time.
[35:19] Absolutely.
[35:22] Now, we always seem to want to go back,
[35:27] which is because we're creatures of
[35:30] time. We we we have to take uh the
[35:33] history that repeats itself and we have
[35:36] to begin to try to look at it in such a
[35:39] way where now wait a minute now I I've
[35:41] been here before has any this happened
[35:44] to anybody and and there you know
[35:46] there's a pattern that seems to be set
[35:48] and and it can be genetic and it can be
[35:51] your home life and it can be your job
[35:54] and it can be your personality but it
[35:56] but and then we we want to bring a
[35:58] course correction. So we we look we look
[36:02] back and and and we go now now I've seen
[36:05] these signs before. I've I've crossed
[36:08] this place and and I and I didn't like
[36:10] what happened before. So I need to
[36:12] change I I need to change
[36:15] direction. I need to stay here at this
[36:18] stop sign a little longer. I whatever it
[36:21] is I I need to get this right. I want to
[36:23] get I don't want to repeat the the
[36:26] historical mistakes that I've made.
[36:28] Amen.
[36:30] Amen.
[36:32] God has a way to fix that.
[36:38] You don't fix it by going back.
[36:44] You fix it by going forward.
[36:47] Amen. Kind of like in Ezekiel one, them
[36:50] creatures, they never went backwards.
[36:53] Whichever way they went, it was always
[36:56] moving forward. Amen. The wheel in the
[36:59] middle of the wheel. Amen. Right. Now,
[37:02] the reason that I'm presenting it this
[37:04] way to you is I want you to understand
[37:06] something. Now, God is not a creature of
[37:07] time.
[37:10] We We I'm telling you, brothers and
[37:12] sisters, young and old, whoever you
[37:14] might be, whether you're highly educated
[37:16] or have no education at all, it doesn't
[37:19] matter.
[37:22] God is eternal and you'll never figure
[37:24] that out. Amen. Amen. Amen. So don't
[37:28] waste any time and energy any energy on
[37:31] trying to
[37:33] fathom a creature that had no beginning.
[37:37] It doesn't even make sense. Yeah. Think
[37:40] about it. What do you mean it didn't
[37:41] have a beginning? Where's it been all
[37:44] this time? Yeah. Amen.
[37:49] There's the problem. Right.
[37:53] Time. Amen.
[37:55] But God instituted time
[38:01] because he wanted to cause problems
[38:06] so he could express his attributes.
[38:09] Right? Now, now that sounds sacrilegious
[38:11] what God wanted. Well, we we've been
[38:14] given to understand by the prophet that
[38:16] God sent us that it it it wasn't God's
[38:20] intention the way you and I would
[38:23] describe it. But God knew that when he
[38:27] began to develop his plan to express his
[38:31] attributes that that he would have to uh
[38:35] allow unknowingly unknowing to the
[38:39] public, unknowing to anyone else but
[38:42] himself. He would have to allow
[38:44] vulnerabilities. He would have to allow
[38:46] weak spots. He would have to allow
[38:48] breaches. He would have to allow He knew
[38:50] that. Now, now the the the God's the one
[38:53] who knew it, right?
[38:57] And he alone, but he realized that they
[39:00] would be exploited.
[39:03] Sure.
[39:05] By all other beings except himself,
[39:09] right? Amen. Right. That's why the
[39:12] emphasis, brothers and sisters, on the
[39:14] hour we live in for this moment. I'm
[39:16] talking about right now
[39:18] is that we came from God
[39:23] if we are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[39:26] Now, I I spend a lot of time preaching
[39:29] on something that a lot of people are
[39:32] beginning to get or not get, and that is
[39:36] there is a difference between Abraham
[39:38] and Lot. Yeah. Amen.
[39:42] Absolutely.
[39:43] Amen. Do you realize that? Read your
[39:46] Bible. Oh, Lot was in Sodom.
[39:50] Abraham was up there hanging out in the
[39:55] desert. Brother Brandham told us that
[39:57] Abraham was the poorest, richest man in
[39:59] the land. Cuz he said he was poor over
[40:02] here and he said he was rich over here.
[40:04] Well, he was rich in faith. Right. Amen.
[40:07] And then when you read in the book of
[40:09] Abraham or the book of Genesis about
[40:11] Abraham, you find out, well, Abraham had
[40:13] a lot of stock, man. I mean, he had some
[40:15] cattle and he had some this and he had
[40:17] some that. But see, Abraham did not
[40:20] measure
[40:23] himself by how much he had. Amen. Right.
[40:28] Abraham measured himself by how much he
[40:31] lacked. Amen.
[40:33] He wanted one thing and one thing alone
[40:36] and that was more of God.
[40:39] And he was willing to leave.
[40:42] Yeah. Right. Everything that was dear to
[40:45] him, that was important to him, that was
[40:49] valuable to him to reach that one goal.
[40:52] Amen. Okay. I know you understand that,
[40:55] but I want to emphasize it. Amen.
[40:59] Brother Brandham says this. I'm going to
[41:02] paraphrase it. It's in uh Christ is
[41:05] revealed in his own word. He's talking
[41:07] about how that uh they that that science
[41:11] looking through their scopes
[41:15] uh and their satellites and sending out
[41:19] their Sputnik and so forth. He says that
[41:21] they're looking for something. That's
[41:23] right. Now, what are they looking for?
[41:24] That's right. The end of the universe.
[41:28] If they find the end of the universe,
[41:31] now what? Yeah.
[41:34] They begin to probe the fabric of the
[41:37] end of the universe looking for what's
[41:39] beyond it. Yeah. Right. Amen.
[41:43] What is beyond it? What good would that
[41:46] do you? That's right. To
[41:49] explore a place beyond your ability to
[41:54] live there.
[41:56] Why? Why? Right? Why go to Mars?
[42:00] Why go to the moon? See, but brother
[42:04] Brandham said that one day, and I
[42:06] believe, brothers and sisters, that
[42:07] you're going to see it on the
[42:10] news, that they have
[42:13] discovered something that
[42:17] Einstein always knew. Yeah. Right. That
[42:21] light bends. Yeah. Absolutely.
[42:25] Amen.
[42:27] and that they are going to be looking
[42:28] through the James Webb super telescope
[42:31] someday and go, "What is that?"
[42:37] Hi, buddy.
[42:41] Brother Brenham said that they would
[42:43] find out someday
[42:46] that they're just looking in a circle.
[42:51] So then what are they going to see in
[42:53] that super telescope? They're going to
[42:55] see their backside. Hallelujah.
[43:00] Amen. You're looking this way.
[43:03] See, I want you to see something. Amen.
[43:07] If you want to get to the root of the
[43:11] problem, keep going forward.
[43:14] Amen. Amen, brother. Amen. Don't back
[43:18] up.
[43:19] Don't take your hand off the plow and
[43:21] turn around and look.
[43:23] just keep moving forward.
[43:29] But we struggle with that.
[43:33] If I was to go to chapter two in my
[43:36] Bible, the heading before the first
[43:39] verse is the day of the Lord, the
[43:42] invading host from the
[43:45] north preparatory to Armageddon.
[43:49] We haven't even fought the battle of
[43:50] Armageddon yet, but we are on the
[43:53] threshold of it. We do know that the
[43:56] king of the north is Russia. We're not
[43:59] afraid of Russia. I could care less
[44:01] about Russia. Brother Brandham said,
[44:03] "Don't fear communism. You fear
[44:07] Catholicism." Not because of the
[44:09] Catholic people. All right, brother.
[44:14] It's what's
[44:15] behind the movement, what's behind the
[44:20] regime.
[44:22] Amen.
[44:24] The diabolicalness.
[44:26] Yes, sir. PE. The people don't even
[44:28] know. Right, brother? Amen.
[44:31] But you and I have been given the
[44:33] opportunity to know. Amen. to know
[44:36] things that no one else knows.
[44:40] My wife and I were watching a
[44:42] documentary on the Great Pyramid and
[44:44] they're trying to figure out how they
[44:46] done it, why they done it, and we've
[44:50] been told that God allowed it to be
[44:52] built through a set of blueprints that
[44:56] Enoch had. Amen. I believe that you
[45:00] Well, brother, you just, you know,
[45:02] you're just taking God out his Yes, sir.
[45:05] Yes, I am. Amen. Right, brother. I've
[45:09] done a lot of things in this life, and I
[45:12] know there's one for sure and for
[45:14] certain thing that you can count on, and
[45:17] that's God's word. Amen. But in order
[45:20] for you to make sure and count on it,
[45:23] you have to get into it. Now, getting
[45:26] into it is going to cause you all kinds
[45:28] of problems.
[45:30] Amen.
[45:32] And that was God's intention
[45:35] cuz he wanted to express himself through
[45:38] his attributes. Now, I got news for
[45:41] y'all. We start writing down God's
[45:43] attributes and we'll say it's healing.
[45:46] It's salvation.
[45:49] Lot was saved. Yes, he was.
[45:53] Saved. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You get that?
[45:58] Lot had salvation. The prophet of God
[46:01] told us, "But something happened to Lot.
[46:04] His
[46:05] location by his
[46:08] choice vexed his righteous soul."
[46:12] Amen. Abraham refused to go down into
[46:15] Sodom. Now you're thinking it's a
[46:18] filthy, dirty place like most any big
[46:21] city on this planet or small town. Now
[46:25] they've brought the big city Yeah. into
[46:28] the small town.
[46:31] Exactly. You have access to anything and
[46:34] everything. It will vex your righteous
[46:38] soul. That's right. So quit thinking of
[46:41] Sodom and Gomorrah as a place that's
[46:44] going to burn. I can tell you that
[46:46] Malachi says the whole earth.
[46:49] It's going to burn with a fervent heat.
[46:51] So we believe in climate change,
[46:54] just not the one they're looking at. And
[46:57] I want you to see that as I move along.
[46:59] I I entitled this really that I give it
[47:02] titles to to provoke you, but it's
[47:04] really all about the two trees.
[47:08] And we see that there's an invasion.
[47:12] Now, this invasion began in heaven
[47:16] before there was anything. And it
[47:18] dropped down into God's creation called
[47:21] earth. And in the garden of Eden, this
[47:25] invasion g began. Right. Amen. It began
[47:28] by the
[47:29] invasion of an insect
[47:33] into a seed.
[47:36] Amen.
[47:38] Come on.
[47:41] If you don't know that, it's laying here
[47:43] before you now. Y right. Amen. And
[47:47] seeds are given for one purpose, to
[47:51] produce after their kind. That's right.
[47:56] Now, what happens when a seed is planted
[48:00] in ground that it can grow in and it's
[48:03] given all the proper things that are
[48:06] necessary for it to take root? Come on,
[48:09] brother.
[48:12] Okay. Now, brothers and
[48:15] sisters, I'm preaching to me as much as
[48:17] I'm preaching to
[48:19] you. We have something wrong with us.
[48:23] Amen.
[48:25] Yeah, that's right. Every single one of
[48:28] us. Amen. Amen. You want to know how I
[48:31] know that?
[48:34] Because there's something in each one of
[48:36] us that's not right. Amen.
[48:41] Amen.
[48:42] Now, we all come from different
[48:44] backgrounds.
[48:46] We all come from different parents,
[48:47] unless you're brothers and sisters. We
[48:49] all come from different
[48:51] an all related.
[48:53] Amen. Cuz I believe the Bible. Yes.
[48:55] Amen. Yes, sir. And the Bible says Noah,
[49:00] Noah was the father of all living
[49:03] humanity since the flood. Amen. But Noah
[49:07] had three sons. That's right. And each
[49:10] one of those sons represented something
[49:13] that was
[49:15] wrong with Noah.
[49:18] But Noah had something right.
[49:22] God looked down upon Noah like he looked
[49:24] upon Abraham and like he looked upon
[49:26] every son and daughter of God and said,
[49:28] "Now I see something in them they don't
[49:32] even know exists themselves." Amen.
[49:36] For instance, Noah was a farmer and God
[49:40] told him, "Pick up a hammer."
[49:44] You and I would be arguing, "I'm not a
[49:46] carpenter. I'm a farmer."
[49:50] Well, you going to become a carpenter,
[49:51] Noah,
[49:53] cuz you're going to need a boat.
[49:58] Think about it, brothers and sisters. I
[50:00] I want I want to bring it home. I don't
[50:02] care if this as far as I want you to
[50:03] understand the two trees working, right?
[50:06] Come on, brother.
[50:10] Noah
[50:11] worked 120 years
[50:14] building a
[50:16] boat for which science told him
[50:21] that things needs wheels.
[50:24] You need to put some wheels on that Noah
[50:26] cuz there ain't no rain
[50:29] in the sky. There was none. Amen. You
[50:32] see, we hear the prophet of God tell us
[50:33] that they looked through their scopes
[50:35] and they did their calculations and they
[50:36] told Noah there was no
[50:38] rain. They were telling the truth.
[50:43] Well, what they didn't know was what was
[50:45] coming. Amen. God saw a man by his
[50:49] choice messing around in a laboratory
[50:53] they had no business in. Amen. And they
[50:57] were building
[50:58] things. That's this this documentary
[51:01] about the pyramid was they can't figure
[51:03] they today 2025
[51:07] the month of April they can't figure out
[51:12] how that py great pyramid was built
[51:18] and they never will
[51:21] but I looked over at my wife and I said
[51:25] doesn't it make you feel kind of good
[51:28] I feel kind of Good. Cuz I have decided
[51:32] that I believe God's word and God sent a
[51:35] prophet to respond to that. And we know
[51:40] what science doesn't know. They going to
[51:41] be scratching their head spending
[51:43] millions of dollars and they they they
[51:45] they're debating about why this and is
[51:47] it an energy source?
[51:50] Is it a tomb? Is it this and that? We
[51:53] can tell them what it is. They won't
[51:55] believe you. All right. You can tell
[51:57] them it's a Bible. Right.
[52:00] Never seen a Bible like that.
[52:04] Well, hand them this one and they'll go,
[52:07] "Ah, that's just a book written by man."
[52:09] Well, who made the pyramid?
[52:12] Look at all the time you're wasting.
[52:15] Huh? Amen. See, brothers and sisters,
[52:19] something's going on. That's why I'm
[52:21] tell what's bugging you.
[52:23] Cuz don't tell me there ain't something
[52:24] bugging you. Amen. Because the word of
[52:26] God says there is.
[52:29] And and Joel begins to be used by God to
[52:32] lay out something so that you can you
[52:34] and I could see this. So let me shift
[52:38] gears. I could spend all the day of the
[52:41] Lord, Armageddon. It's it's all about
[52:44] 800 BC.
[52:47] It's all the end time is right here.
[52:49] Amen.
[52:51] Everything written in this book points
[52:53] to one thing. Come on,
[52:56] brother. That's right, brother boy. The
[52:59] end.
[53:01] But here's the great part. It's just the
[53:04] end.
[53:07] For death. That's right. For sin. Amen.
[53:11] For unbelief. Amen. For unhappiness.
[53:15] Amen. For no joy, for disappointment,
[53:19] all the things you can lay out, it's the
[53:21] end for that. Amen.
[53:24] It's the beginning of the joy. Amen. Of
[53:28] the Lord. Amen. And the joy of the Lord
[53:30] is by strength. Amen, brothers and
[53:33] sisters. And I know it's yours, too. I'm
[53:36] going to read something to you so I can
[53:38] turn a corner. And believe me, brothers
[53:41] and sisters, I ain't trying to get done.
[53:45] Ain't
[53:47] happening. Out of Jehovah Gyra, part
[53:50] two, 76 of 62, paragraph 48. Look at
[53:54] Joel. He said, "It shall come to pass in
[53:57] the last
[53:59] days, Joel,
[54:02] last days,
[54:05] that God would pour out his spirit."
[54:10] How that there would come a canker worm
[54:12] and eat up his church.
[54:17] I want y'all to hear me now. That can
[54:19] worm is working in this building right
[54:21] now. Because of the serpent seed,
[54:26] two trees. Amen. Tree of knowledge of
[54:29] good and evil, tree of life. God allowed
[54:31] them to grow in the same garden, the
[54:35] same fenced in area, the same church.
[54:40] Amen. Come on, brother. Amen. Listen
[54:43] now. I'm going to bring it down. The
[54:44] same body. Amen. Uh this is two trees.
[54:48] Yep. The tree of life is working and the
[54:51] tree of knowledge of good and evil is
[54:53] working. Yes, sir. Depends on which one
[54:56] you give your time to. That will
[54:58] determine who has the strength. Amen.
[55:03] Now, the devil working through his tree
[55:06] has decided to destroy instead of give
[55:10] life. Amen. He's the only guy I know
[55:13] that wants to kill his church members.
[55:16] Amen. Right.
[55:19] He's trying to destroy you. Yeah. And
[55:22] you are his constituents
[55:25] as long as we're in this body. Amen.
[55:27] This sinful body of flesh.
[55:31] But he has no strength.
[55:35] Except what you and I give him. Amen. He
[55:37] has no power. Exactly. Except what you
[55:40] and I give him. And I ain't giving him
[55:43] nothing. Amen.
[55:46] Amen. Now, he'll take,
[55:49] but I ain't giving. Amen. You
[55:52] understand? And you need to have the
[55:54] same attitude if you're going to make it
[55:56] because of what's bugging you. Yep.
[55:59] Right.
[56:01] Cuz these bugs, this cankerworm and this
[56:05] this this this locust and this
[56:06] caterpillar and this I I look these
[56:09] words up. They all come Listen careful
[56:12] now. And my wife knows it. I'm not
[56:14] making a pun, but I'm going to say it
[56:16] from the same root. Yeah. Right. Amen.
[56:19] Right.
[56:21] Same root. The same root
[56:26] word. All four of these bugs were given
[56:31] names. Why? Why not just one name?
[56:34] Because they are working in four
[56:36] different stages. And they have been
[56:39] working on you since you were born. And
[56:43] they're still working on you. They're
[56:45] still in there. Want you to understand
[56:48] that. Oh, now I know that the
[56:50] self-righteous go, "No, I ain't got."
[56:52] You're in a body of sinful flesh. One of
[56:56] these four stages is working on you, but
[56:59] you don't have to let it have its way.
[57:04] Because the tree of life is there to
[57:06] come back. You with me? Listen to what
[57:09] the prophet said. There would come a
[57:10] canker worm and eat up his church. What
[57:13] the Palmer worm left the canker worm and
[57:15] the canker worm and the caterpillar and
[57:17] it's the same bug, same insect in four
[57:21] different stages. Each one eat a part.
[57:25] Amen. You realize that that it starts
[57:28] out with the b the bug eating the fruit.
[57:33] If there's a bug that's going to eat the
[57:34] fruit, that means the tree was ripe.
[57:38] It was mature. Amen.
[57:42] But you let that bug eat that fruit off
[57:45] the tree and after a while you begin to
[57:48] get bitter. Yeah.
[57:53] What did brother Brandham call it? The
[57:55] root of bitterness. Amen. It'll kill
[57:59] you.
[58:00] Because what a root of bitterness is
[58:04] there for is to see whether or not
[58:07] you'll cultivate it. You see, Adam was
[58:09] put in the garden to tend it.
[58:14] We're in the same garden this morning.
[58:18] Did you realize that? Amen. That every
[58:21] believer has the tree of life in them.
[58:27] And the tree of knowledge of good and
[58:29] evil because of the perverted birth,
[58:31] because of the fall. It's right here.
[58:34] Yes. Right. Yeah. Satan has his
[58:38] tactics and God has his way of combating
[58:42] it.
[58:44] Amen. We have to yield to God's way.
[58:48] Amen. And we're going to find out and we
[58:51] know it. We've been told it day in day
[58:53] out, hour in hour out. The only
[58:56] protection you and I got is God's word.
[59:00] Amen. It's the only protection we got.
[59:03] Okay. It's the only defense we got.
[59:06] Amen. Here come that old caterpillar on
[59:09] the cake worm or the cake worm and eat
[59:11] the bark off. So we can see that it's
[59:14] going to go, he says, and eat the bark
[59:16] off and the other eat the fruit off and
[59:18] then along comes the others and suck the
[59:20] life out of it. Yeah.
[59:27] A locust.
[59:31] The root of all four stages is the
[59:33] locust.
[59:37] When you look it up in the dictionary
[59:38] and it says grasshopper,
[59:43] ying.
[59:44] Don't touch it.
[59:47] See, you don't want the preacher
[59:49] touching you. Yeah. You don't want them
[59:52] them words of God touching something
[59:54] because you you get a little jumpy.
[59:57] Amen. No, no, no, no. He who who told
[59:59] him? Yeah. Did you tell him? I didn't
[1:00:01] tell him.
[1:00:03] That's right.
[1:00:05] Just knowing don't get nervous.
[1:00:10] See that? So, what I'm saying is it's
[1:00:13] it's the nature of the locust. Right.
[1:00:16] And one of the problems with the nature
[1:00:18] of the locust is it's not
[1:00:23] only
[1:00:25] jumpy, but
[1:00:27] it
[1:00:30] increases rapidly.
[1:00:34] You want to talk about offspring? Why do
[1:00:35] you think it was a plague? Absolutely.
[1:00:38] That's the I'm giving you the root of
[1:00:41] the word. Amen. and from the locust, the
[1:00:45] cankerworm, and from the cankerworm, the
[1:00:46] caterpillar, and from the caterpillar,
[1:00:48] the palmer worm. Now,
[1:00:50] remember, the reason why these four bugs
[1:00:53] are used is because God knew that Satan
[1:00:57] would try to employ a tactic that would
[1:01:00] begin to eat your tree of life down to
[1:01:03] the roots. Amen.
[1:01:08] I'm talking about religious people now.
[1:01:09] I'm not talking about worldly people.
[1:01:12] Right, brother? Amen. Talk about you and
[1:01:14] me. This wasn't given for them. This was
[1:01:18] given for you and me. Amen. Right.
[1:01:22] Hallelujah. All of them have one thing
[1:01:25] in
[1:01:26] common in their definition and that is
[1:01:30] to lick up,
[1:01:33] to devour
[1:01:36] and to ravage. Those are the connections
[1:01:40] to these four bugs.
[1:01:43] Amen. Now, it just depends on what stage
[1:01:47] of the journey you're in as to which bug
[1:01:51] the devil is using
[1:01:54] because it eats the bark, then it eats
[1:01:58] the fruit, then it eats the leaves, then
[1:02:00] it eats the bark, and the next thing is
[1:02:03] the sap. Right. That's why when brother
[1:02:07] Brandham and I said it yesterday about
[1:02:09] the So, so what about the sap to that
[1:02:12] man on this porch there out squirrel
[1:02:14] hunting? Yeah. Who tells the sap? Yeah.
[1:02:19] Well, if you know that you are being
[1:02:22] bugged by the devil, then you get that
[1:02:26] sap down in your roots.
[1:02:30] That's the Holy Ghost. Amen. rooted and
[1:02:33] grounded. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:39] Sometimes it's got to hide in you for a
[1:02:42] season.
[1:02:44] Amen. But you stay
[1:02:47] like a tree. Amen. Planted by rivers of
[1:02:52] living water. Amen.
[1:02:55] You cannot be moved. Oh, the winds of
[1:03:00] doctrines are going to come and rock you
[1:03:03] from side to side. But if you got that
[1:03:06] life, that sap in your roots, your roots
[1:03:10] are only going deeper and deeper and
[1:03:13] deeper. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:17] Let the wind blow.
[1:03:19] Who cares? That's right. Amen.
[1:03:25] Eat the fruit off. Then along come the
[1:03:28] others and suck the life out of
[1:03:31] it. You may think I'm crazy, but this is
[1:03:33] the way how I work. I looked up the word
[1:03:37] bug because he said it's the same bug in
[1:03:40] four different stages. You You'd think
[1:03:43] they'd give all kinds of crazy crazy
[1:03:45] definitions for bug. It's real
[1:03:47] simple. It's an insect. Now listen to
[1:03:50] the dictionary. I just used a regular
[1:03:52] old Mariam Webster dictionary and this
[1:03:55] is how it started out of the shoot
[1:03:58] insects. Then in parentheses it says
[1:04:02] such as an assassin bug.
[1:04:05] Can you imagine them starting out with
[1:04:07] that one? An assassin or a chinchbug?
[1:04:14] Who likes to stay in a hotel with bed
[1:04:15] bugs? Raise your hand. Of course, nobody
[1:04:18] does.
[1:04:25] Insects that have sucking mouth parts. I
[1:04:30] didn't make this up. I just got out of
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] dictionary. Why do they have sucking
[1:04:35] mouth parts? Cuz they're looking for one
[1:04:37] thing. Your life. That's right. Amen.
[1:04:40] And if they can get their lips and their
[1:04:43] teeth and their whatever they got
[1:04:45] embedded into you, they are going to
[1:04:47] start sucking the life out of you. But
[1:04:50] it's done in four stages.
[1:04:54] Amen. That's why what's going on today
[1:04:58] in the world, in politics,
[1:05:01] in the church, listen now, and in the
[1:05:04] message. Come on, brother. See, Lot
[1:05:07] followed the message. Amen.
[1:05:10] Abraham was the messenger and Lot left
[1:05:13] his hometown to follow the messenger.
[1:05:17] And the messenger and the messenger are
[1:05:21] but somewhere along the way one of these
[1:05:24] bugs got to bugging
[1:05:29] lot. Which bug was
[1:05:33] it? The one that said,
[1:05:36] "Hey, there's not enough to eat here for
[1:05:38] us."
[1:05:41] Well, you looking for a different
[1:05:42] message. Yeah. Come on, brother.
[1:05:45] Now, Abraham didn't have to say that. He
[1:05:47] did. He probably did not say it. We
[1:05:49] don't read it in the Bible, but he knew.
[1:05:51] Yeah.
[1:05:53] Abraham was spoken to by God. I'm going
[1:05:55] to tell you folks something. It's the
[1:05:56] reason why I love
[1:06:00] Mack, Shadrach, and Abednego. Why?
[1:06:03] because they went into the fire.
[1:06:05] No, the results of what I'm going to
[1:06:08] tell you is why they could go into the
[1:06:09] fiery furnace and not fear.
[1:06:12] They believed Daniel was God's prophet
[1:06:16] so much.
[1:06:19] Yeah. Amen. An angel visited Daniel. An
[1:06:23] angel never visited Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:06:25] and Abednego. They just listened to the
[1:06:28] angel speaking through Daniel.
[1:06:32] Right.
[1:06:33] and believe that was God's word. Amen.
[1:06:36] For their hour,
[1:06:38] and they refused,
[1:06:42] they had such revelation that they
[1:06:46] refused to worship Daniel. Yet they
[1:06:50] believed what Daniel said.
[1:06:54] Cuz we know a statue was set up for the
[1:06:56] worship of Daniel. And guess what? The
[1:06:58] prophet of God told us for our hour. The
[1:07:00] same way the gentile dispensation came
[1:07:04] in. The same way it'll go out. The
[1:07:06] worship of the holy man. Everybody's
[1:07:07] thinking the pope. Well, who is the
[1:07:09] pope? Yeah, brother.
[1:07:14] Think about it. I'll let that sink in. I
[1:07:17] know we're on broadcast, so I won't say
[1:07:19] that's all right like I say it at home.
[1:07:21] That's why I don't broadcast.
[1:07:24] Cuz I want my family to know when we're
[1:07:26] sitting at the dinner table, right?
[1:07:28] Let's talk. Amen. Did you know that
[1:07:31] sitting at the food table is how Abel
[1:07:35] found out what to sacrifice? Yes, sir.
[1:07:39] He didn't have a written Bible. He
[1:07:41] didn't have no tapes. No. He didn't have
[1:07:43] what you and I might call a prophet.
[1:07:45] Right. But he had something in him that
[1:07:49] Cain didn't have. Amen.
[1:07:52] The right seed. Amen.
[1:07:57] What caused Abel to get the revelation
[1:08:01] to sacrifice? I mean, think about it,
[1:08:02] brother. Put yourself back there. Come
[1:08:04] on. Nothing had died yet.
[1:08:10] How did Abel
[1:08:12] know? God didn't give him a manual. No.
[1:08:16] He didn't have human resources to go to.
[1:08:18] Right.
[1:08:20] He didn't have a helpline. He didn't
[1:08:22] have the internet.
[1:08:25] Right. But when it came time to
[1:08:27] sacrifice for what had been done,
[1:08:32] that's right. I I want you to understand
[1:08:35] he you and me are just he he
[1:08:38] just walked over there to his little pin
[1:08:42] and got out. He looked at lambs over and
[1:08:44] he found one with no blemish on it.
[1:08:46] Amen. Amen. probably his favorite lamb
[1:08:51] and put a rope around it. And the lamb's
[1:08:54] innocent. He's We're going for a walk.
[1:08:59] Yes, we are.
[1:09:01] Just like Abraham and Isaac were going
[1:09:03] for a walk.
[1:09:05] That's right. And he brought that lamb
[1:09:07] over to a to a an altar that was
[1:09:10] probably a a rock flat on the top. And
[1:09:13] he laid it down there and the lamb's
[1:09:15] innocent. He's like, "I'm going to get a
[1:09:17] massage."
[1:09:20] Think about it. I'm not saying it so
[1:09:23] much to be I want you to understand how
[1:09:25] it works.
[1:09:28] That's right.
[1:09:32] And then he had a sharp
[1:09:34] rock, piece of obsidian maybe or
[1:09:38] something, I don't
[1:09:41] know. And pull that neck back and slice
[1:09:44] that thing open.
[1:09:47] I'm going to tell you folks, Cain was up
[1:09:50] in arms. Yeah.
[1:09:52] What do you think you're doing?
[1:09:57] Come on.
[1:10:01] I tell you what, you try it in public
[1:10:03] and see what response you get. Yeah.
[1:10:09] You'll be in prison. If you make it
[1:10:12] Yeah. to prison. I'm not speaking
[1:10:15] against animal rights people. You
[1:10:17] understand? I'm talking about a
[1:10:18] mentality.
[1:10:22] Talking about the way people are. They
[1:10:25] give
[1:10:28] more. I can't I I can't express it. They
[1:10:31] they they give more to the life of an
[1:10:33] animal
[1:10:35] and to the life of a human being who's
[1:10:37] got a soul and a chance for eternal
[1:10:41] life. Amen.
[1:10:45] Listen now. I'm preaching this way
[1:10:47] because I don't want you to end up
[1:10:48] there. And that's what this bug is going
[1:10:51] to try to do. It is working its way
[1:10:56] through the message of the hour. It'll
[1:10:59] never get the message. No. Do you
[1:11:02] understand that? It will never touch the
[1:11:04] life. Where the danger comes in, and I
[1:11:07] know now I'm going to turn a corner.
[1:11:09] Where the danger comes in is the carrier
[1:11:11] of the life. Exactly. Right. Yeah, God
[1:11:14] knew that. God knew that if he kept his
[1:11:17] life intact that it would never be
[1:11:21] altered. But he got a carrier. Amen. A
[1:11:25] tree.
[1:11:28] Amen. It's the carrier. Think about
[1:11:31] it. What are they doing today?
[1:11:35] Trying to take apart the carrier. Right.
[1:11:38] Amen. They can't touch the life.
[1:11:42] can't touch it. But if they can get the
[1:11:45] car because that's all they see. They
[1:11:47] think if they destroy the carrier,
[1:11:50] they've destroyed the life. I got news
[1:11:52] for them. Easter morning proved them
[1:11:54] wrong. They tried to destroy the carrier
[1:11:58] of God's life. And he rose
[1:12:01] and said, "I'm back."
[1:12:04] And I didn't come back by going
[1:12:06] backwards. I come back by going forward.
[1:12:08] Amen. Amen. Amen. Brothers and sisters,
[1:12:11] this is truth. Not because I'm preaching
[1:12:14] it. I believe God's word. Amen.
[1:12:18] Everything that I preach, I preach out
[1:12:20] of the message of the hour. Well, so do
[1:12:21] a lot of men who are off. That's right,
[1:12:23] brother. But what they're doing is
[1:12:25] they're they're allowing one of these
[1:12:27] insects to alter.
[1:12:29] Listen now, careful. The carrier. That's
[1:12:32] why it's so hard. It would deceive the
[1:12:34] very elect if possible. Why? Because
[1:12:37] it's the carrier. Brother Brandham
[1:12:39] taught us in anointed ones at the end
[1:12:40] time. It is the very Holy Spirit that
[1:12:43] falls on the just and the unjust.
[1:12:47] You say, "Well, I'm a seed of God." But
[1:12:49] make
[1:12:50] sure that bug ain't working in you.
[1:12:52] Yeah. Amen. Right. Come on. Make sure.
[1:12:57] Have you got your fruit? Yeah. Right.
[1:13:01] Have you got your leaves? Yeah. Right.
[1:13:03] Amen. That's what brother Bam said the
[1:13:05] leaves did. They get up there in them
[1:13:07] quaking ass where I live and they just
[1:13:09] clap their hands all the time. A little
[1:13:11] breeze comes by and they and they really
[1:13:13] do. If you look at them, they look like
[1:13:15] they're clapping their hands and they
[1:13:16] got lots of hands. Yeah. Right.
[1:13:21] After the leaves, they get the bark.
[1:13:25] Brothers and sisters, do you realize
[1:13:27] that you and I are in some stage of this
[1:13:30] journey? And you might say, "Well,
[1:13:32] brother Chris, then there is no hope."
[1:13:34] Oh, there's better than that. Yeah. Come
[1:13:37] on, brother. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:39] There's faith. Yes. Amen. Amen. Faith
[1:13:44] will conquer Yes. everything.
[1:13:48] God set it up that way. I didn't make it
[1:13:52] that way. You didn't make it that way.
[1:13:54] The president didn't make it that. God
[1:13:56] made it that way. Amen.
[1:13:58] He wants you and I to understand
[1:14:00] something through the life of someone
[1:14:04] like Abel, even though it's brief. Abel
[1:14:06] by faith. Amen. Offered unto God. Uh
[1:14:12] listen now. Cain offered a sacrifice.
[1:14:15] Sure did. Cain worked harder. Yeah.
[1:14:19] Yeah. Sure did. Cain's
[1:14:22] sacrifice smelled good.
[1:14:26] Cain's sacrifice was beautiful.
[1:14:33] But it wasn't more excellent
[1:14:36] than Abel's. Hallelujah.
[1:14:39] Abel's sacrifice
[1:14:41] was excellent. Yes. Amen. Because he
[1:14:47] believed the message that God gave him
[1:14:50] by faith. How do you get faith? Faith
[1:14:53] cometh by hearing of the word of God.
[1:14:57] And brother Brandham tell you you said,
[1:14:59] "Oh, brother, you just said there was no
[1:15:01] written Bible. There was no way for Oh,
[1:15:03] yes, there was. He was sitting
[1:15:05] in church."
[1:15:07] Amen. Which is the dinner table, the
[1:15:11] lunch table, the breakfast table. And
[1:15:14] brother Brandham said he was listening
[1:15:16] to Adam and Eve discuss how they ended
[1:15:20] up outside that garden. So much so that
[1:15:23] Abel look would look back and he would
[1:15:26] see the two angels with flaming swords
[1:15:28] and he would say, "What are we doing out
[1:15:30] here?" Yeah. Does anybody feel that way?
[1:15:32] I feel that way. Right. What am I doing
[1:15:35] in this decaying, decrepit, painridden
[1:15:41] body that looks like it's being eaten
[1:15:44] away by those four bugs?
[1:15:48] I got news for them bugs.
[1:15:51] Destroy this temple.
[1:15:55] Hallelujah. Now, I can't raise it up,
[1:15:57] but the God that's in me. Listen now. I
[1:16:00] want to get this to the believers. God
[1:16:01] that's in us has
[1:16:03] already raised us up. That's why I
[1:16:08] started off with Romans 8:1. Do you see
[1:16:11] that in Romans 8:1 there are two trees?
[1:16:18] Think about it. Read it. Cuz if you read
[1:16:21] it and you go, "How in the
[1:16:23] world?" Then the devil start working on
[1:16:25] one of them bugs starts. It's a trinity.
[1:16:28] It's a trinity.
[1:16:30] It's a trinity.
[1:16:32] How could Paul say to our God and father
[1:16:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ that because
[1:16:38] Paul had a revelation
[1:16:41] Abel had a revelation.
[1:16:43] Everybody in Romans uh excuse me,
[1:16:46] Hebrews 11 had a revelation. Faith by
[1:16:49] faith they did all that. Brothers and
[1:16:51] sisters, you and I have to have a walk
[1:16:55] of faith. Amen. Amen. And faith goes
[1:16:58] against the grain of everything this
[1:17:02] world stands for because faith is belief
[1:17:06] in something for which there is no
[1:17:10] proof.
[1:17:11] That's why they send those satellites
[1:17:13] out there. They're looking for proof.
[1:17:15] Amen.
[1:17:18] They're not looking for God.
[1:17:22] They're looking for proof.
[1:17:27] Hallelujah. Eureka,
[1:17:31] we found it. Amen. Amen. Amen. I may
[1:17:35] have said this here before, I'll say it
[1:17:37] again. Do you know how many billions of
[1:17:40] dollars, trillions of dollars they spend
[1:17:43] on exploring for something they'll never
[1:17:46] find?
[1:17:48] I'll give them a discount. I'll tell
[1:17:50] them right now, it's without money.
[1:17:52] That's right. It's without price. Yes.
[1:17:55] He is here. Yeah. Amen. Now the
[1:17:58] religious people have challenged that.
[1:18:02] That's the reason why God is going to
[1:18:05] allow the
[1:18:07] ministry of William
[1:18:11] Brham to resurrect.
[1:18:14] Now you think I'm preaching return. Oh
[1:18:16] no. He never left. He's always here.
[1:18:19] Amen. I'll never forget listening to
[1:18:22] Charles Johnson live in concert and he
[1:18:25] he's playing and he's singing and he he
[1:18:27] don't see he kind of looking out on a
[1:18:29] congregation. It's
[1:18:36] like you get
[1:18:39] it. And he says, "Hold it. Hold it." To
[1:18:41] his band members, stop right there.
[1:18:44] guitars and the drums and everything
[1:18:45] gets quiet. He says, "I see there's a
[1:18:49] problem." He says, "You're all waiting
[1:18:51] for
[1:18:52] something." Come on. Oh, yeah. Lightning
[1:18:55] bolt. Electric shock. Pillars of fire.
[1:19:00] Come on. Something.
[1:19:03] Huh? This is This be, you know, come on.
[1:19:06] This man don't do nothing for me. I
[1:19:07] ain't trying to do nothing for you.
[1:19:11] Trying to get you to do something with
[1:19:12] yourself. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:16] He says, "I know what y'all waiting for.
[1:19:19] Y'all waiting for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:19:20] down in the meeting. I got news for
[1:19:23] you." He said, "You've been here for
[1:19:24] 2,000 years."
[1:19:26] You see, he's never left.
[1:19:29] Amen. Those four bugs are operating in
[1:19:32] each one of us. And what are they after?
[1:19:35] They really don't care about the fruit.
[1:19:37] They really don't care about the leaves.
[1:19:38] They really don't care about the bark.
[1:19:40] They care about the life.
[1:19:43] Amen. Amen. And thereafter that life
[1:19:46] that's in you. But brothers and sisters,
[1:19:48] if you've got the tree of Christ planted
[1:19:51] by the river of living waters in you, he
[1:19:53] can't touch that. Amen. He's going to
[1:19:56] gnaw on this tree right here until there
[1:19:59] ain't no life left in it.
[1:20:02] He cannot touch the tree of life. Amen.
[1:20:06] Couldn't touch it. Thank you, Lord. Look
[1:20:08] how Look, look, look. Brother Brandham's
[1:20:10] going to tell us something here in a
[1:20:11] minute.
[1:20:14] We should be eating off the tree of life
[1:20:16] every moment and every hour of the day.
[1:20:20] But watch
[1:20:22] this. He says,
[1:20:25] "Christ, that tree that was in the
[1:20:27] Garden of
[1:20:30] Eden,
[1:20:31] Christ, that tree that was in the Garden
[1:20:34] of Eden, there were two trees in the
[1:20:37] Garden of Eden. These two trees were set
[1:20:40] there for a birth purpose. Amen. That's
[1:20:45] what he says.
[1:20:47] And Eve, she was the tree of death. Wait
[1:20:52] a minute, ladies. Don't get upset. If
[1:20:55] she was touched. Yeah. Did you get that?
[1:21:00] And this is the same tree that was going
[1:21:03] to bring forth Christ. Amen.
[1:21:07] But it was not going to be touched.
[1:21:10] Right. Right. I want you to get this.
[1:21:12] You adults, you understand this. No one
[1:21:15] was going to touch Eve.
[1:21:20] Cuz only spoken words.
[1:21:22] We're going to produce what God had
[1:21:25] planted in that tree. You and I
[1:21:29] represent that original seed. Yes. Now,
[1:21:33] that's the reason why the spoken word to
[1:21:36] you and me
[1:21:39] is life. Amen. Because it's something
[1:21:42] that doesn't touch you this way. It's
[1:21:46] something that touches you down in the
[1:21:49] depth of your soul. And you can't
[1:21:51] explain it to your neighbor. You can't
[1:21:53] explain it to your wife. You can't
[1:21:54] explain it to your parents. You can't
[1:21:56] explain it to your children. You can't
[1:21:58] explain it to your friends. I'm going to
[1:22:00] tell you something right now. You can't
[1:22:02] explain it to yourself,
[1:22:04] but you know that you know that you know
[1:22:07] that it's working in you because you
[1:22:10] feel the life
[1:22:14] of the lifegiver. Amen. But death is
[1:22:17] still working in you. And there's the
[1:22:20] two trees. Right. Amen. See, the
[1:22:25] tree of knowledge of good and evil was
[1:22:29] set there by God. But I'm going to tell
[1:22:31] you that God said, "Don't you touch it."
[1:22:35] Amen. So why don't you get your hands
[1:22:37] off of it. Quit trying to make it
[1:22:41] something that it will never be. Amen.
[1:22:44] Huh? You see, we're always trying to
[1:22:47] work ourselves around to where we feel
[1:22:49] better or that we live better or that we
[1:22:53] worship better or that we are better.
[1:22:55] Get your hands off that. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:00] Hallelujah.
[1:23:02] Let go.
[1:23:04] Let God. Amen.
[1:23:07] Brother Brandham tells us the spoken
[1:23:08] word is the original seed that
[1:23:10] eventually Eve would have brought forth
[1:23:13] Jesus Christ.
[1:23:16] Amen. Amen. People are like,
[1:23:21] "Every seed brings forth after its
[1:23:23] kind." Come on. Everybody knows this.
[1:23:26] How did Adam get here?
[1:23:28] It wasn't through propagation. Right.
[1:23:32] Amen. No,
[1:23:36] you all understand that. Yeah. Amen. The
[1:23:38] part that we're missing sometimes is
[1:23:41] that the fall in the Garden of Eden
[1:23:44] didn't happen literally when the serpent
[1:23:48] put his hands on Eve. You see, that's
[1:23:50] the way we're thinking, right? What I'm
[1:23:52] telling you to do is get your hands off.
[1:23:55] Don't touch that reason. Yes.
[1:24:00] Don't touch that conscience.
[1:24:02] Don't touch that memory.
[1:24:04] Huh? Don't touch that affection.
[1:24:08] Keep your hands off of it if it agrees
[1:24:10] with God's word. Amen. You still don't
[1:24:13] have to touch it. That's right. Get your
[1:24:16] hands off that education. I'm not
[1:24:17] talking about you're not going to school
[1:24:19] now. That's right. Don't get See, see
[1:24:20] you if you start to think you thinking
[1:24:22] down the wrong tree.
[1:24:24] I'm telling you, don't try to educate
[1:24:26] your soul into eternity. Don't try to
[1:24:30] educate your soul into believing. Don't
[1:24:33] try to educate your soul into becoming
[1:24:36] what God wants you to become. Let go and
[1:24:38] let God get your hands off of it. Amen.
[1:24:41] But we got to touch it. Yep. Touch.
[1:24:45] Touch. Touch. After a while, it's gone
[1:24:49] too far. Amen. Catch that. It's gone too
[1:24:53] far.
[1:24:55] But I'm talking about your soul now. I'm
[1:24:56] not talking about your natural body.
[1:24:57] Right, brother? Amen. After the fall,
[1:25:00] God said that's just the way it's going
[1:25:02] to be. But I'm going to start to work on
[1:25:06] my attributes, which are my children
[1:25:08] from a different angle. I'm going to
[1:25:10] work on them from the tree of life,
[1:25:12] which is Christ Jesus. Amen. Amen. You
[1:25:15] get that? Amen. That's how he wants to
[1:25:18] work on you and me. Yes. Amen. But if
[1:25:20] you let these bugs that Satan introduced
[1:25:24] into our natural life, they will begin
[1:25:27] to eat you away. And after a while,
[1:25:30] you'll find yourself, "No, I don't
[1:25:32] believe that no more." Come on, brother.
[1:25:34] Right. Yes, sir. Is there even a God?
[1:25:39] Prophets. Ah, those are just guys that
[1:25:42] came along and had a gift and were
[1:25:44] anointed and somebody started following
[1:25:46] them.
[1:25:51] Think about your life. Can I ask you who
[1:25:55] you following? Yeah. You know, you know,
[1:25:58] I can I can zero that in for you. What
[1:26:00] music you listening to?
[1:26:03] Because music comes from someone. And if
[1:26:06] you're following their music, see, it's
[1:26:07] like the message, then you following
[1:26:08] them.
[1:26:12] I know what music I'm following. Amen.
[1:26:14] Onward Christian soldier. Amen. marching
[1:26:18] to a picnic. No,
[1:26:22] marching as to war. Amen. With the cross
[1:26:25] of Jesus. Amen. Going on before. Amen.
[1:26:28] That's what the prophet saw in that
[1:26:30] vision. Now, unfortunately, there was a
[1:26:32] few folks that had tried to step out of
[1:26:34] line. Yeah. But fortunately, God had a
[1:26:38] voice in these last days that said, "Get
[1:26:41] back in line." Amen. Amen.
[1:26:45] Thank you. So if you fell out of line,
[1:26:48] get back in line.
[1:26:51] Amen. Don't fall back. Amen. Go forward.
[1:26:56] Amen. Right. Amen. I'm I'm going to
[1:26:59] close because see, brothers and sisters,
[1:27:02] look, I'm just giving you a small
[1:27:05] portion of what's available to you and I
[1:27:08] anytime we want it. Amen. And I'm going
[1:27:11] to tell you that it's not absolutely a
[1:27:14] want. It's a need. I want it because I
[1:27:18] knew I needed it. But I didn't know I
[1:27:20] wanted it until a need rose up and said,
[1:27:22] "You dying, boy. You're out. You're out
[1:27:25] of here. I was just 21 years old when
[1:27:29] that s Man, you must have been a wreck."
[1:27:30] No, I was on top of my game. Yep. But I
[1:27:33] realized I can't always stay on top of
[1:27:36] my game. Right, brother.
[1:27:39] That's how God got to me. And brothers
[1:27:42] and sisters, it takes some people,
[1:27:44] listen careful, 90 years. Amen. Cuz
[1:27:49] brother Brandham saw, can you imagine
[1:27:51] living 90 plus years on this planet
[1:27:53] without Christ? But finally,
[1:27:57] cuz one of the people he met beyond the
[1:27:59] curtain of time, don't you remember her?
[1:28:00] No, I don't remember her. She was 90
[1:28:02] plus years old.
[1:28:06] Don't you be that one.
[1:28:08] You get it right now. Now is the time.
[1:28:12] Today is the day of salvation. Amen.
[1:28:14] Amen. Listen to what he says. And I
[1:28:16] always want to reemphasize to you folks,
[1:28:19] especially the younger folks who maybe
[1:28:20] don't study the things the way that us
[1:28:23] older folks do or that we're dedicated
[1:28:24] to doing. And that is that the woman,
[1:28:26] when you hear the word woman, it's
[1:28:28] always a type of the church. So don't
[1:28:30] think that God is talking down the
[1:28:32] woman. He wants you to understand that
[1:28:34] the woman is a type of the church.
[1:28:39] That's the reason why the women's
[1:28:41] standards are set too high. No, they're
[1:28:44] not. No, brother. You just ain't going
[1:28:46] high enough. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:50] Good. She was the tree of death if she
[1:28:53] was touched. And Christ was the tree of
[1:28:56] life. It don't say nothing about
[1:28:58] touching. Right. Now, by the woman comes
[1:29:02] death. By the man come life. Now when he
[1:29:04] stood here talking to the Jews, they
[1:29:07] said, "Our fathers eat mana in the
[1:29:09] wilderness for 40 years." Yeah.
[1:29:12] What were they doing? Looking back,
[1:29:16] looking back. Yeah. They hadn't touched
[1:29:18] a piece of that mana since their fathers
[1:29:22] touched it. Yeah. That's right. And he
[1:29:25] said, "And there everyone dead, but I am
[1:29:28] the bread of life, the tree of life that
[1:29:31] come from God out of heaven, that a man
[1:29:33] eats this bread and shall never die."
[1:29:36] That's right. God put saraphims there
[1:29:39] guarding that tree that no one would
[1:29:41] touch it. Now he's got seraraphims
[1:29:44] trying to drive them into that same
[1:29:48] tree.
[1:29:52] What's a saraphim?
[1:29:55] Is that a
[1:30:01] burner? They seen the vision. They
[1:30:04] wanted to the tree to get back without
[1:30:07] an atonement. But now after the
[1:30:09] atonement is made, the devil is binding
[1:30:11] them and blinding them. Excuse me. Turn
[1:30:14] them this way from the tree. Notice when
[1:30:16] Christ came on God on earth, he was
[1:30:18] God's perfect tree. David saw him in the
[1:30:21] first psalm. Tree planted by the river,
[1:30:22] rivers of water, many rivers, one water,
[1:30:25] many gifts, same spirit. His leaves
[1:30:27] shall not wither. See, that insect can't
[1:30:30] touch that tree. But that tree has got
[1:30:33] to be growing in you.
[1:30:35] Regardless of what the bugs are doing
[1:30:38] out here, that's why that's what's
[1:30:39] bugging you.
[1:30:41] I tell you what's bugging you. You're
[1:30:44] letting one of those insects in its form
[1:30:47] eat away something.
[1:30:51] They're there to suck the life out of
[1:30:53] you.
[1:30:54] Amen.
[1:30:56] Well, we just use pesticides in
[1:31:01] I got a pesticide for you.
[1:31:05] The word of God. Amen.
[1:31:10] It works.
[1:31:12] Come on. Come on now. Anybody in here
[1:31:14] got a green thumb and like to garden? We
[1:31:17] spend way more time picking weeds
[1:31:21] than we do picking fruit. See how it
[1:31:24] works? I want you to understand that.
[1:31:27] Picking weeds, waiting for the fruit. It
[1:31:31] takes a a half hour to pick the fruit.
[1:31:34] I've been with brother Wade over there
[1:31:35] at his daddy's garden and and and we can
[1:31:38] we can knock her down in 45 minutes or
[1:31:40] an hour.
[1:31:42] But the weeds WDE's been picking them
[1:31:44] for months.
[1:31:47] Come on.
[1:31:50] You say, "Well, why did God make it this
[1:31:51] way?" He just wants to see if you're in
[1:31:53] it That's right. for the long haul.
[1:31:56] Or if you're just in it for the flash in
[1:31:58] the pan, right? If you're just in it for
[1:32:00] the time, if you're just in it for the
[1:32:02] money, if you're just in it for the
[1:32:04] glory, if you're just in it for the
[1:32:05] feeling. Yeah. All those things have
[1:32:08] their place, but he wants to know if
[1:32:09] you're in it. Amen. Are you in me? Yeah,
[1:32:12] that's right. That's the only way that
[1:32:14] any of us can say I have the power to
[1:32:16] lay. I do not have the power to lay my
[1:32:18] life down. But the prophet of God said
[1:32:20] you could say it if Christ is in you.
[1:32:23] Amen. Because the same spirit that
[1:32:26] raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you.
[1:32:31] Romans 8:11.
[1:32:33] You got authority. You remember brother
[1:32:36] Brandham talking about John 1 and he
[1:32:38] gave us power and brother Brandham says
[1:32:42] notice in the margin of your Bible it
[1:32:43] says authority and he uses a little
[1:32:45] bitty cop of course I like to say Barney
[1:32:47] five some of you don't even know who he
[1:32:49] is just a little old scrawny guy that's
[1:32:51] always trying to go by the rule book and
[1:32:53] his hat don't fit right
[1:32:55] and and he's going to go out into the
[1:32:58] middle of the street and stop a 350
[1:33:00] horsepower 90 mph pickup truck. Come on.
[1:33:04] don't even make sense, right? He was
[1:33:07] given the authority, by the
[1:33:11] uniform, by the badge, by what's behind
[1:33:15] it to hold his hand up. And that if the
[1:33:18] man's got any sanity at all, he's
[1:33:19] hitting the brakes. That's right. Right.
[1:33:20] That's right. Well, that's not
[1:33:23] power. Cuz power would be one of these
[1:33:26] superheroes that y'all are worshiping.
[1:33:28] Boom. I just stop it right there.
[1:33:30] Superman, he can make the world spin the
[1:33:31] other way. Yeah. I got news for
[1:33:34] you. He's a myth. Yeah. Come on. Amen.
[1:33:39] Why are we driving around our lives on
[1:33:42] myths? Yeah. Why? Why do we serve things
[1:33:46] that are just here for a time? Right,
[1:33:50] brother? When God has presented to you
[1:33:52] and I Yes. eternal life.
[1:33:55] Well, what are we going to do?
[1:33:58] Why does it matter? Yeah, that's right.
[1:34:00] Amen. We're going to live. Yeah. Yes.
[1:34:03] Well, I don't want to live like this.
[1:34:05] See, you're thinking the wrong way now.
[1:34:07] The reason you're living like this is
[1:34:09] because you're living like this. You
[1:34:11] start living for him. And you start to
[1:34:13] see beyond the sunset. You got to you
[1:34:15] get to see what the prophet saw behind
[1:34:18] the horizon. And I'm going to tell you
[1:34:19] something. I'm going to close with this.
[1:34:24] There's more, but I'm gonna close with
[1:34:26] this one.
[1:34:36] What does the seed of discrepancy
[1:34:38] produce? A root of bitterness.
[1:34:45] In the message seed of discrepancy 1861
[1:34:48] 1865 paragraph 50. We are all most all
[1:34:52] of us read the
[1:34:54] Bible. Brother Brandham gave a little
[1:34:56] margin there for folks that don't.
[1:34:59] Now like when Jesus come and he found
[1:35:01] that discrepancy contrary. Now he was
[1:35:04] the word made manifest.
[1:35:07] There's our problem. It's not just the
[1:35:10] word brothers and sisters. We got to
[1:35:12] have action.
[1:35:14] Amen. Okay. He was God's interpretation
[1:35:17] of the word. Yep. Every believer
[1:35:20] believes that because he said, "Search
[1:35:22] the scriptures for in them you think you
[1:35:25] have eternal life and they are they that
[1:35:27] testify of me." That's where we're
[1:35:29] looking in here for him. But what you
[1:35:32] need to realize is the reason we're
[1:35:35] looking for him in those scriptures is
[1:35:37] because that's where we think we have
[1:35:39] eternal life when really eternal life
[1:35:42] lays in the manifestation of the
[1:35:43] scriptures. Right. He He said, "I am the
[1:35:47] truth, the life, the way. I am the bread
[1:35:50] of God that comes out. I am." See,
[1:35:53] and they they they were stumbling over
[1:35:55] it. Why? Because he was the carrier.
[1:35:57] Amen. That's right. They just looked at
[1:35:58] We don't crucify you. Yep. That's right.
[1:36:01] We don't crucify you for being a good
[1:36:03] man. Nope. For feeding the poor, for
[1:36:07] healing the sick. We crucify you because
[1:36:09] you being a carrier
[1:36:12] have proclaimed yourself God. Right?
[1:36:16] Amen.
[1:36:19] Did you pick up something there? Now you
[1:36:22] all know why they're picking on the
[1:36:25] prophet.
[1:36:27] He's just the carrier. It ain't going to
[1:36:30] stop there.
[1:36:32] them bugs are in there and they're going
[1:36:35] to start working towards the life that
[1:36:38] you got that God gave you.
[1:36:43] Remember, it's just a carrier.
[1:36:47] That's right. It's the life that
[1:36:48] matters.
[1:36:51] Lay I can lay it down. See where it's
[1:36:54] coming from now? I can lay this carrier
[1:36:57] down, but the life of God that's in me
[1:36:59] can raise it up.
[1:37:02] The life that's in me from God came from
[1:37:05] God and it's going to go back. The
[1:37:06] carrier I don't even like this carrier.
[1:37:09] Yeah.
[1:37:13] Come on.
[1:37:15] All you got to do is look in the mirror.
[1:37:17] I know some of you think you're pretty
[1:37:19] and handsome and but that'll go away if
[1:37:20] time goes on.
[1:37:24] Because you'll begin to realize, man, I
[1:37:26] ain't half what I used to be.
[1:37:28] And then if you keep going, I ain't a
[1:37:30] quarter what I used to be.
[1:37:32] Brothers and sisters, it's truth. That's
[1:37:34] right, brother.
[1:37:36] I'm preaching this way because I want to
[1:37:38] work on your soul. Amen. Oh, I care
[1:37:40] about your body. If you're
[1:37:42] sick, get prayer. And believe in that
[1:37:47] prayer. Amen. If you got trouble, God
[1:37:52] has a fountain.
[1:37:54] But it's your soul that matters. That's
[1:37:58] right. That is the key.
[1:38:01] That's what them bugs are working
[1:38:02] towards. I'm going to tell you folks
[1:38:04] something. Them bugs will never get to
[1:38:05] your soul. That's right.
[1:38:08] Right. That's why God told the devil.
[1:38:12] You had Job. Don't touch his life.
[1:38:16] Because God knew that was his life and
[1:38:17] it wouldn't do the devil any good to
[1:38:19] touch it. That's right.
[1:38:21] Can I finish? Please do. Right.
[1:38:25] [Laughter]
[1:38:28] For in them you think you have eternal
[1:38:30] life, and they are they that testify of
[1:38:31] me. There you are. He was the
[1:38:34] interpretation of the word. And every
[1:38:37] born again son and daughter of God of
[1:38:40] this age. So now it's come down to you
[1:38:44] and me. Not every age. This agemen
[1:38:50] is the interpretation of the word. Amen.
[1:38:54] You are, he says, written epistles, read
[1:38:58] of all men. Do you realize that you are
[1:39:01] going to end up by following God to the
[1:39:03] end? Endure. Is that the word we were
[1:39:04] talking about? Endure to the end. You
[1:39:07] will become the Bible they read. Amen.
[1:39:10] They don't believe that book. No, they
[1:39:12] don't.
[1:39:14] No more than the Sadducees and the
[1:39:16] Pharisees believed it. Y
[1:39:20] but if they see you and me
[1:39:24] with the ministry a quick short work
[1:39:26] with the ministry of the capstone I'm
[1:39:29] just quoting to you brother Brandham you
[1:39:30] should know that with the ministry of
[1:39:32] the capstone the same ministry brother
[1:39:35] Brandham said that left now people say
[1:39:38] well that was brother Brandham he was
[1:39:39] the first sheath wave offering he was
[1:39:42] the first one to come to fruition but
[1:39:45] this refers to all of us we become the
[1:39:48] every bornagain son and daughter of God
[1:39:51] of this age becomes the interpretation.
[1:39:54] You are the interpretation of the word.
[1:39:56] But you've got to let the word live.
[1:39:59] Amen. Amen. It's got to become manifest
[1:40:02] in you. Well, brother, I mean, I don't I
[1:40:04] don't I'm not the guy to shoot off
[1:40:05] fireworks. He didn't say fireworks. No,
[1:40:08] you just live the life. You can be the
[1:40:09] most quiet,
[1:40:11] you know, unpos just just,
[1:40:16] but if the life is in there, you may
[1:40:18] not. That's why they're looking. Did you
[1:40:20] know that they think the pyramid, the
[1:40:22] great
[1:40:23] pyramid is a source of energy,
[1:40:26] and they believe that somehow it was
[1:40:28] drawing energy out of the earth. I got
[1:40:31] news for you. It wasn't drawing energy
[1:40:34] out of the earth. It was putting energy
[1:40:36] into the earth. Amen. Right?
[1:40:39] They just misunderstand
[1:40:41] its use.
[1:40:43] Think about it. Think about they're
[1:40:45] trying to draw the
[1:40:47] life. Scientists trying to draw the life
[1:40:49] out of the earth by trying to figure out
[1:40:51] how to throw the switch. Pull the lever
[1:40:54] for the pyramid. I see. I said these
[1:40:57] guys are out of their mind. This earth
[1:40:59] needs all the life it can get. But what
[1:41:01] does the bug do? The bug sucks the life.
[1:41:05] You see the same mentality? They want to
[1:41:07] suck the life out of the Earth for what?
[1:41:09] The moon?
[1:41:13] Sure. So we can go live on it. Come on.
[1:41:17] SpaceX and all them
[1:41:19] outfits. What are they going to do when
[1:41:21] they get to the moon?
[1:41:24] Pollute it.
[1:41:26] Destroy it.
[1:41:28] Well, let's go to Mars.
[1:41:31] Where are you going to stop?
[1:41:36] God is so good to us. Can I do one more
[1:41:39] thing as you stand?
[1:41:42] Because I I I promise the sister and and
[1:41:45] I know that it's it was God because it
[1:41:47] just plays right into this that I'm
[1:41:50] going to read
[1:41:52] the
[1:41:53] paragraph where brother Brandham
[1:41:56] says, "You make
[1:41:58] room for the Holy Spirit." Amen. Amen.
[1:42:05] Now, I got one,
[1:42:07] two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[1:42:12] eight paragraphs highlighted, but I'm
[1:42:14] not going to read them
[1:42:18] all. I'm going to read the first one and
[1:42:21] the last
[1:42:22] one. Acts of the Holy Spirit 12:19 to
[1:42:25] 54. And I've wondered through the
[1:42:27] years when I'd see that and read
[1:42:31] it, I thought,
[1:42:34] "Lord, here comes men and
[1:42:36] women. I've seen them come to the altar
[1:42:39] and kneel down and cry and pray and go
[1:42:42] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:42:44] Jesus and in a week later be out with
[1:42:47] the world again."
[1:42:49] I thought, "Oh God, surely your word is
[1:42:52] not wrong.
[1:42:54] I just can't understand it. But you,
[1:42:57] Lord, if I'll continue with you, you
[1:42:59] said your word would abide in
[1:43:04] me. So I continued with
[1:43:08] him. Did you catch that? So I continued
[1:43:11] with him until now. I see what it is.
[1:43:16] He has made it known. See, and I never
[1:43:19] knew it until the Lord just opened it up
[1:43:21] one day and there it was laying right
[1:43:24] before me. Then I seen them people
[1:43:27] wasn't what they was at the beginning.
[1:43:31] Amen. See, no man can come to me except
[1:43:33] my father draws them. It's not he that
[1:43:36] wants to be. It's God that elects it to
[1:43:39] be. It isn't whether you want it or not.
[1:43:42] You have nothing to do with it. It's
[1:43:44] God. He hardens whom he will harden. He
[1:43:48] has mercy on whom he will have mercy.
[1:43:50] That's right. And no matter who you are,
[1:43:52] what position you have, whether you're
[1:43:54] the president or whether you're a bomb
[1:43:56] on the street, doesn't make a bit of
[1:43:59] difference. God has mercy on whom he
[1:44:02] will have mercy. Now, I'm going to drop
[1:44:03] down to the last
[1:44:05] paragraph. Brother Bram said, "Well,
[1:44:08] excuse me, three little ones. If I tried
[1:44:10] to say, well, I'll quit drinking. I'll
[1:44:11] quit smoking. I'll quit stealing, lying,
[1:44:13] so forth. That's what I done." See, that
[1:44:16] would be my own. That's why I tell you,
[1:44:19] keep your hands off of it. See, I'd have
[1:44:22] something to brag about, but I didn't
[1:44:24] quit nothing.
[1:44:27] He just come to me and took it out of
[1:44:29] me. That's it. Then it ain't what I
[1:44:32] done, it's what he done. And then the
[1:44:36] Holy Spirit then
[1:44:38] abides, abides in and grows daily.
[1:44:44] just grows, making itself greater and
[1:44:47] greater, pushes out the things, the
[1:44:50] cares, the temptation as you overcome
[1:44:54] them,
[1:44:56] the Holy Spirit takes its place. Do you
[1:45:00] know what? If you got a real bad
[1:45:03] temptation of something that's not
[1:45:04] right, overcome that thing a few times
[1:45:08] and watch if your testimony doesn't
[1:45:11] bloom. Amen.
[1:45:13] on account of it.
[1:45:16] Two trees.
[1:45:18] One of them you and I have little
[1:45:21] control over.
[1:45:24] But if you've got the tree of life in
[1:45:26] you,
[1:45:28] it can say to this mountain,
[1:45:32] it can say to this tree,
[1:45:35] listen here, tree of knowledge of good
[1:45:36] and leave. I'm plucking you up by the
[1:45:39] roots. I'm getting rid of everything you
[1:45:42] stand for. And if you you all know about
[1:45:44] pulling weeds, you don't want that weed
[1:45:47] to come back. You find every root. Amen.
[1:45:53] Every root of bitterness. Amen. Find it.
[1:45:58] You don't have to confess it to the
[1:45:59] pastor. You just need to pluck it up.
[1:46:03] Amen. Amen. Let's pray. Father, you are
[1:46:07] so good to us. Lord, love you with all
[1:46:10] my heart,
[1:46:11] Father. Pray that these words, Lord,
[1:46:14] would take
[1:46:15] hold. Now, I know it's not up to me,
[1:46:18] Father, but you have
[1:46:20] chosen man to be used by you, Lord. And
[1:46:25] I can see why, Father. We're all frail.
[1:46:29] We're all have faults. We all have
[1:46:32] shortcomings, Lord. But you have chosen
[1:46:34] a handful of carriers.
[1:46:38] Lord, and even you won't let them get in
[1:46:41] your way. Amen. If they trip up along
[1:46:45] the way, Father, we found out through
[1:46:47] the life of the prophet, he just refused
[1:46:49] to go to one meeting and lost his wife
[1:46:51] and daughter. It was never the same
[1:46:53] again,
[1:46:55] Lord.
[1:46:57] Father, he refused, Lord, to listen to
[1:47:00] the words of the angel in Africa that
[1:47:03] told him, "You go up there with that
[1:47:04] brother."
[1:47:06] He let all them bugs bug him until Lord
[1:47:10] he went their way and he nearly died
[1:47:13] from a
[1:47:16] bug. You know what you're doing, Lord.
[1:47:19] If we just throw our hands
[1:47:21] up and we just surrender to
[1:47:24] you, Lord, and not look to the right or
[1:47:27] to the left. Don't look behind us, Lord,
[1:47:29] but let us focus on the
[1:47:32] prize as Paul taught us.
[1:47:36] It's for your honor and your glory,
[1:47:38] Father. We love your children wherever
[1:47:40] they meet. We love the people here in
[1:47:43] Georgia, Lord, because we believe,
[1:47:45] Father, they came
[1:47:46] here to hear from you.
[1:47:50] I pray, Father, that that was the end
[1:47:52] result of the service, Lord. That we
[1:47:55] would never look back, but always
[1:47:58] move towards you.
[1:48:02] for your honor and your glory. Lord, we
[1:48:03] pray in Jesus name.
[1:48:08] Amen. God bless you. Thank you for
[1:48:11] letting me come and be a part of your
[1:48:13] life. Amen.
[1:48:16] [Applause]
[1:48:26] You dwell in you. That's right. Amen. If
[1:48:31] there's been that
[1:48:35] great, if
[1:48:39] there
[1:48:42] you will
[1:48:44] quicken your
[1:48:47] body by that
[1:48:50] spirit that dwells in you.
[1:48:54] Oh, you
[1:48:56] will. That's
[1:48:57] right. Jesus from the dead. Dwell in
[1:49:01] you.
[1:49:03] You believe that? Dwell in you. The only
[1:49:05] way you're going to get
[1:49:07] changed to dwell inside of
[1:49:09] you. There is you believe the Lord.
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:15] You better
[1:49:16] believe there is two trees.
[1:49:20] One's bothering you all the time and the
[1:49:23] other one trying to help
[1:49:25] you not let that grief on you all over
[1:49:28] the
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:37] place and that
[1:49:40] spirit that dwells in
[1:49:43] you with that
[1:49:45] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:49:50] that dwell in
[1:49:52] you. Who dwell in
[1:49:56] you? If that
[1:49:58] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:50:02] dead dwell in
[1:50:05] you, oh dwell in
[1:50:08] you, oh it will bring on your mort.
[1:50:16] If that spirit leads dwells in
[1:50:20] you, oh
[1:50:24] w your mortal
[1:50:27] body, if that
[1:50:30] spirit dwells in
[1:50:33] you, and if that
[1:50:36] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:50:40] dead, it dwell in you.
[1:50:44] dwell in
[1:50:45] you. And if that
[1:50:48] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:50:52] dead in
[1:50:56] you
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:02] again
[1:51:07] might know you
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:17] body in
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:24] his brother.
[1:51:31] What's bugging you? We all have that
[1:51:34] problem. Something bugs us all the time.
[1:51:38] But like brother Chris said, I'm glad he
[1:51:40] ended it up. He says, "Root them up.
[1:51:44] Pull it up by the roots. And when you
[1:51:46] pull that thing up by the roots and you
[1:51:48] throw it,
[1:51:50] get it out of that soil, get it out of
[1:51:52] that soil that it was in, it dies. It
[1:51:57] can't survive. Because remember those
[1:51:59] two trees were planted in the same
[1:52:01] garden. And I read y'all a quote not too
[1:52:04] long ago when we were talking about the
[1:52:05] two trees that Brother Ram said their
[1:52:07] vines were intertwined.
[1:52:09] Wow. Hallelujah. Cuz it's going to be so
[1:52:12] close in the end time. It's not going to
[1:52:14] be a tree over here and a tree over
[1:52:15] here. Satan's going to intertwine itself
[1:52:17] and make himself look like that tree.
[1:52:21] Amen. We don't want to look like God. We

[1:53:12] brother Nate. Thanks for coming. How
[1:53:13] about coming up here and dismissing us

[1:53:23] Nathaniel's day is brother Joe Green
[1:53:24] from Ruth Rutherford somewhere up there
[1:53:27] in North Carolina. And we sure do
[1:53:29] appreciate him. We watched him grow up
[1:53:30] as a little boy and now he's just a big

[1:53:44] Just hearing the things of God and how
[1:53:46] our brother has brought these things out
[1:53:48] to us so clear this morning, Father.
[1:53:50] Lord, I ask as we leave this building,
[1:53:52] may we never leave your presence,
[1:53:54] Father. Be with us as we travel, be with
[1:53:56] us as we go our separate ways. Bless our
[1:53:58] brother Chris and his wife as they head
[1:54:00] back home, Brother Wade and Sister June
[1:54:01] as they travel. Lord, I pray that you
[1:54:03] just be with us until the next appointed
[1:54:05] time. Father, in your precious, holy
[1:54:07] name we pray. Amen. And amen. You're
[1:54:10] dismissed. Remember, Wednesday night,
[1:54:12] Brother Bob will be preaching and

[1:55:01] comfort in
[1:55:04] God. And his love comforts me. And his
[1:55:11] grace has set me free. And
