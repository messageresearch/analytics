[15:48] by the way of the Fall
[15:51] and he was going to turn this thing

[15:54] Eden and that's what we believe is going
[15:56] on now amen
[15:58] Satan got into God's Eden well now God
[16:01] just turned right around and got into
[16:02] Satan's Eden amen so that's all it is
[16:04] now with them everything's going on in
[16:07] the world did you see where the 150
[16:09] something people got killed trampled to
[16:12] death in China or wherever it was over

[16:22] concert or something and they were so
[16:25] packed into 150 people were trampled to
[16:29] death just in one Street
[16:31] one area 150 people and all of them
[16:33] ninety percent of them were below the

[23:00] who is the Son of Man Mark 67 in the
[23:02] beginning was the word and the Word was
[23:03] with God and the Word was God and the
[23:06] Word was made flesh that's what it's got
[23:08] to happen that in the end time that is
[23:10] the son of man brother brother Brian
[23:12] what is who is the son of man he's the
[23:13] in the beginning was the word where it
[23:15] was with God and the Word was God and
[23:17] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[23:20] us and we beheld his glory now that's
[23:23] what I want you we're going to talk
[23:24] about that little piece of it be hell
[23:26] how are you going to behold is Glory if
[23:27] he's not here
[23:30] how you going to do that
[23:31] through you
[23:33] through you you're his glory you're his
[23:35] victory you're what he's going to
[23:37] produce to the Earth through me and you
[23:40] because he's not here in physical form
[23:43] he's not here he's only here in spirit
[23:45] form the Son of God but the son of man
[23:47] Ministry is going to have to come back
[23:50] into last day to change our bodies
[23:52] because that's what it done with the son
[23:54] of man it changed his body is that right
[23:56] so that's what we're heading toward but
[23:58] we got to come to step by step we can't
[24:00] go to the first grade in 12th grade we
[24:02] got to go one two three four five all
[24:04] the way up and we beheld his glory the
[24:06] glory of the only begotten of the father
[24:08] full of grace and truth you know if

[24:11] begotten of the father you're not
[24:12] begotten to you you say well I'm the
[24:14] third child of my mom and daddy you
[24:15] might be but if you're born again you're
[24:17] the first child of God
[24:18] amen you got to start thinking yourself
[24:20] that way there is no there is no uh
[24:23] family and then you've got this one born
[24:25] first and no we're all born again
[24:28] Believers the Son of God Revelation that
[24:31] we're going to look at here in just a
[24:33] second
[24:34] look full of grace and truth how we're
[24:36] going to be full of grace and truth by
[24:37] the word of God Amen first Thessalonians
[24:40] said that every one of you should know
[24:41] how to possess his vessel and
[24:43] sanctification and honor you say well I
[24:46] need some help well God's going to help
[24:48] you but you're going to have to make an
[24:49] effort
[24:50] you're gonna be possessed of one or the
[24:52] other
[24:53] we'll talk about that a little bit
[24:55] in the sermon and be not conformed to
[24:57] this world but be transformed by the
[25:00] renewing of your mind
[25:02] not your neighbors not your wives
[25:05] your mind
[25:07] that you may prove what is that good and
[25:09] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[25:10] you may be seated see that says you may
[25:12] prove
[25:13] we know God's going to prove through us
[25:16] but we've got to be a yielded vessel for
[25:18] that to happen thereby with me amen for
[25:22] that to happen you got to be a yielded
[25:24] vessel to yield yourself to God
[25:28] and that God can what work through you
[25:31] with you
[25:32] brother Brown said you and God in there
[25:34] as persons amen
[25:37] you don't lose your personality when you
[25:39] get born again you receive the
[25:40] personality of God
[25:42] and that what vulcanizes with your soul
[25:45] is we're going to talk about the heart
[25:47] in just a minute because you got to
[25:48] start with the heart
[25:49] then you come to the five outer senses
[25:51] and then you got the five Outer Outer
[25:53] Outer senses that you are well that you
[25:56] are well you're sitting here today with
[25:57] it memory reason Consciousness you're
[25:59] hearing what I'm saying you're seeing
[26:02] all right she tastes feel smelling hair
[26:06] then you've got memories and cost
[26:07] effects and Imagination then you've got
[26:09] what faith or doubt and that's the only
[26:11] senses that you have to work with thank
[26:13] God for a prophet that he could separate
[26:15] them yet make sure that they stay
[26:17] together because you keep you pull them
[26:18] apart you're dead
[26:19] all right
[26:21] the soul without the spirit the Bible
[26:23] says flesh without the spirit is dead
[26:25] it's all dead so now you're what a
[26:27] Triune being
[26:29] that God has put on this Earth let it be
[26:33] bye
[26:35] permissive will or sexual act as
[26:39] permitted by God to get you here for you
[26:42] to make a choice so it's all low
[26:44] everything we talk about today is by
[26:46] choice by your free moral agency even
[26:49] though you may be born again if you
[26:51] don't have free moral agency then God is
[26:53] going to just pull you a tube he's going
[26:55] to pull you up the statue of perfect man
[26:56] no brother Brown so you got to fight for
[26:58] every answer you of what you're looking
[27:00] for right all right we'll call just a
[27:01] minute
[27:02] I gotta hurry through this all right
[27:04] remember first thing you got to do is be
[27:06] born again now what is that you got to
[27:07] be changed so the soul has got to be
[27:10] changed not exchanged
[27:13] taking out another one put in no that'd
[27:15] be really easy and that wouldn't be you
[27:19] right because you were born a unit a
[27:20] body a spirit and a soul that's you
[27:23] brother Brown that's why he said I don't
[27:25] believe in transmigration I don't
[27:26] believe in reincarnation in other words
[27:28] I don't believe in pre-existence of
[27:29] Souls
[27:31] all right so let's get away from that oh
[27:33] brother I thought I saw you before the
[27:35] foundation world now in the word of God
[27:37] maybe you did but you didn't see my
[27:39] person my person didn't come into being
[27:41] until we came on this Earth amen so
[27:44] let's just take away all that other
[27:45] stuff and my soul didn't migrate over to
[27:47] somebody else's nobody would want it
[27:51] and the congregation said
[27:53] amen you didn't have to say it that much
[27:56] and he gave some how we going to do this
[27:58] we know this but we've got to we've got
[28:01] to see he gave some Apostles prophets
[28:02] pastors evangelists and teachers for
[28:05] what the perfecting of the Saints so you
[28:07] can't get it but you can't grow without
[28:09] it you can get the new birth but you
[28:12] can't grow without having these five
[28:14] foes of the ministry of God in your life
[28:18] that's why we try to bring evangelist in
[28:20] different ones and and uh
[28:23] and seeking for some to come a little
[28:25] bit later
[28:26] for the what for the Perfection of the
[28:28] Saints what for the work of the ministry
[28:29] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[28:31] till we all come to the unity of the
[28:33] faith and of what of the knowledge we're
[28:35] going to talk about that a little bit
[28:36] later we know that there's a knowledge
[28:37] up here and we know that there's a world
[28:39] in knowledge that's why we've got to
[28:40] have a a mind not a mind take my mind
[28:43] out and put the mind of God in
[28:45] Paul says we got to have the mind of
[28:47] Christ
[28:48] which works through your mind because
[28:50] you're still a human being over here all
[28:52] right we still have human thoughts we
[28:54] still have human ideas but we've got to
[28:56] bring it what into the center Center
[28:58] realm and then work its way out all
[29:01] right because the very Fountain of you
[29:02] today is your soul the very Fountain of
[29:05] you is your heart whatever we're going
[29:06] to read it in just a minute or maybe
[29:07] this afternoon the Bible says out of the
[29:10] abundance of the heart
[29:13] the map speakers
[29:15] out of the abundance of the heart your
[29:17] mouth speaks what is the abundance of
[29:19] the heart not this thing right here this
[29:20] is flesh
[29:22] but it's your soul it's your psyche it's
[29:24] you and then that you Works its way out
[29:27] to memory reason conscious face and
[29:29] Imagination and then Works yourself out
[29:31] and all this does it does what it tells
[29:32] the told to do
[29:34] I'm doing this because somewhere in my
[29:36] brain is telling me to do this because I
[29:38] want to because I've thought about it
[29:39] get by with me you say what's this got
[29:42] to do with the Statue of perfect man we
[29:43] got to have a mind we got to have a mind
[29:45] change it's got to change our thoughts
[29:49] hey man it's got It's got to change it
[29:51] but it's got to start from the heart
[29:53] all right
[29:54] let's read this right here so the
[29:56] knowledge of what the Son of God unto a
[29:57] perfect man look that we henceforth be
[30:00] no more children
[30:02] and that's fine
[30:05] you know it's
[30:07] you can't take it out of the Bible hands
[30:09] on the sick but there is time where it
[30:11] comes to where you're gonna have to
[30:12] speak the word
[30:13] amen there's got time to where you've
[30:15] got to speak the word not somebody else
[30:17] you've got to speak the word not waiting
[30:19] on the preacher to speak the word not
[30:20] waiting on the prophet of God to come
[30:21] back he's already spoke the word
[30:25] but you and I to speak the word to have
[30:28] enough Faith inside of ourselves to what
[30:30] have power with character that we're
[30:32] going to talk about in a minute power
[30:34] with characters fit to what rule over
[30:35] what you first
[30:38] rule over me first I gotta get me
[30:41] under control
[30:45] I gotta get me under control
[30:48] so that stars go by the baptism of the
[30:50] Holy Ghost and the Son of God and the
[30:52] revelation of the Son of God where Jesus
[30:54] kept kept talking kept talking he was
[30:57] the son of God but he was also what the
[30:59] son of man the Son of God was speaking
[31:01] through that son of man everybody with
[31:04] me all right and he never he never made
[31:08] now he made human mistakes but he never
[31:10] made a mistake in the word
[31:12] he never misquoted the Old Testament he
[31:15] never said oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[31:17] say that no what he said he said my
[31:20] words are spirit and their life
[31:22] and he didn't back off from it one bit
[31:24] why because he was all of it total
[31:28] the son of man
[31:31] you and I
[31:33] when we get up to that Capstone
[31:35] that's why the seals when the seals
[31:37] broke that broke so that we could have
[31:39] an ability to think just like Jesus
[31:42] thought
[31:44] to talk just like Jesus taught
[31:48] now sorry to say that in the Son of God
[31:51] Revelation you can have some false
[31:53] teaching
[31:54] everybody with me you can have some
[31:56] false teachings to prove it Martin
[31:58] Luther
[31:59] he was the son of God
[32:01] he taught a trinitarian doctrine that
[32:04] didn't come from his soul
[32:06] somehow in his memories and conscious
[32:08] effects and Imagination Satan put a dart
[32:10] in there
[32:13] so our son of God can be deceived
[32:17] brother Branham preached the mighty
[32:19] conqueror in 1957 58 59 preached it from
[32:22] Revelation chapter 6 verse 1.
[32:26] but when he got to the first seal he
[32:28] said I'd have made a horrible mistake
[32:29] why he was getting ready to move into
[32:31] that the revelation of the son of man
[32:34] were what he what come out of his mouth
[32:35] was what God was teaching to people it
[32:39] was the mind of God think of what before
[32:41] then man come on people before then
[32:44] there was confusion they're still
[32:46] confusion now but before then there was
[32:48] so much confusion was it this was it
[32:51] that was it Trinity was it Oneness was
[32:53] iTunes was it three was it water baptism
[32:56] this way or that way
[32:58] brother random under the ministry of the
[33:00] Son of God he brings that back to what
[33:02] the faith of the fathers
[33:04] all right he brings that back to the
[33:05] faith of the fathers and when he brings
[33:07] it back to the faith of the fathers he
[33:09] then thinks he's finished and then we've
[33:11] quoted it many times brother Dallas
[33:12] preached on it for years and years and
[33:14] years about he's come to a place he said
[33:16] not in the years of preparation where's
[33:18] the years of preparation listen this is
[33:21] the years of mind and your preparation
[33:24] this is when you grow what your years
[33:26] listen each and every one of you sitting
[33:28] here today has a purpose either in God
[33:31] or the devil
[33:34] well praise the Lord
[33:36] who else
[33:39] well I got a purple either God or the
[33:42] devil one of the two
[33:46] excuse me for drinking so much my
[33:48] throat's a little bit
[33:49] a little bit sore but the Son of God
[33:52] Revelation is our growing time
[33:55] hey bye with me
[33:57] because Jesus had to grow in Grace and
[33:59] knowledge the Bible says and being made
[34:01] perfect
[34:03] I'm reading Bible
[34:05] well he became the what the author
[34:07] the author
[34:09] he wrote something down he wrote a book
[34:11] what do you write me and you he wrote
[34:12] away from me and you to become that
[34:15] but remember that was rejected the top
[34:18] part where it says son of man
[34:20] that justification we're coming to that
[34:23] sanctification we're coming to and that
[34:25] body changed we are coming to but it
[34:27] started on the day of Pentecost or it
[34:29] started on what your day of Pentecost by
[34:32] the new birth
[34:33] you you had a day of Pentecost
[34:36] where a tongue of fire lit on top of
[34:38] your head and went down into your soul
[34:40] and burnt the devil out
[34:43] didn't kill your soul it burned him out
[34:45] drove him out the unclean Spirit goes
[34:47] out of a man
[34:48] but you had it sealed in by God so there
[34:50] was no way Satan could get back in but
[34:52] where did he go
[34:53] he went to your second realm memory
[34:55] reason conscious inspection imagination
[34:57] that's where he's working that's what
[34:59] brother Brown said the greatest battle
[35:00] ever fought was what in your mind
[35:03] what is your mind every thought
[35:05] everything you do develops from your
[35:07] mind
[35:08] everything
[35:10] you do develops from your thoughts amen
[35:14] that's what we're going to talk about if
[35:15] we get to it
[35:19] Peter says far as so is the will of God
[35:21] this is this is something I I want us to
[35:23] see this so much because you know what
[35:27] Jesus stood many many times
[35:31] and the Common People heard him gladly
[35:34] the Sinners hurt him
[35:36] the prostitutes
[35:37] Matthew Mark Luke and John they all
[35:39] heard him they all heard Jesus it's a
[35:41] man there's nobody ever spoke like this
[35:43] man but where was his trouble
[35:45] his trouble was with the Pharisees and
[35:48] the Sadducees his trouble was with the
[35:51] religious world he he I don't say he
[35:54] couldn't stand them but every time he
[35:56] got around him he started calling him
[35:58] names
[35:59] everybody with me he wasn't he didn't he
[36:02] wasn't no soft open
[36:04] he said you're snakes you vipers
[36:08] father of the devil
[36:11] so what was he doing
[36:13] he was telling the people he said look
[36:16] I can't do this all by myself
[36:19] hello somebody
[36:20] I'm gonna have 120 that's going to start
[36:23] here in just a little while when I leave
[36:24] there's going to be 120 me come back
[36:26] you're gonna have to deal with all them
[36:28] and then you're going to bring Paul into
[36:30] court you're going to bring Peter into
[36:31] court you're going to bring James into
[36:33] court John and here we go they came here
[36:36] I am one man but they're all over the
[36:38] place now
[36:40] so what did it do it puts a silence the
[36:42] ignorance of foolish man
[36:44] men
[36:46] so is the will of God so this is a will
[36:48] what is the will of God the word of God
[36:49] is that with well-doing
[36:53] you may put to silence not that you're
[36:56] boastful
[36:58] but God's going to put he's going to put
[37:01] the words in your mouth and it's going
[37:02] to make this people silent
[37:04] The Silence of what
[37:06] foolish men
[37:08] if you've got the baptism of Holy Ghost
[37:09] today you are not foolish
[37:13] it can't be
[37:15] your Soul's as Eternal as God is it's
[37:17] not Eternal as God is it is God
[37:19] all right
[37:23] all right let's get on down here said
[37:24] here's what it is it's easy to feel the
[37:26] power of God we're going to get to this
[37:28] a little bit later and I'm going to read
[37:29] you a real shocking quote to see it when
[37:31] you believe but then when it comes to
[37:33] The Showdown are you able to possess the
[37:35] thing that you profess to have do we as
[37:37] little Georgia possess what we profess
[37:40] to have
[37:43] that's my question to all of us
[37:46] that's the thing brother
[37:48] we've got to get it we've got to take it
[37:51] it's ours but you'll fight for every
[37:54] inch
[37:55] it's a struggle
[37:58] I told Bob
[38:00] Luis and Aaron
[38:03] I said y'all won't be preaching much
[38:06] because you come from here
[38:11] did I like
[38:18] you make one round and that's about it
[38:21] because when you start preaching
[38:23] and teaching the word of God to people
[38:27] foreign
[38:28] ERS get jealous
[38:35] well why
[38:36] why would I not as a pastor of a church
[38:39] or anybody I'm saying them out there me
[38:42] as a pastor of that church
[38:44] would not want somebody to come in and
[38:46] if my people if it if it brought your
[38:49] eyes this big and if it brought you said
[38:51] Hey brother could you tell us that and
[38:53] say hey bro wait could you bring that
[38:55] guy back again we need some of this
[38:58] oh buddy one hat you know what happens
[39:00] is don't you Mr selfish pops up
[39:03] you're always trying to steal my people
[39:06] no he's trying to preach the word of God
[39:10] I want us to make it
[39:12] I just want us to make it I don't care
[39:14] how we make it
[39:17] skin of our teeth so what we made it
[39:21] listen David the great king that had
[39:23] everything in the world
[39:25] he said Lord just let me be a doormat
[39:29] just let me be a doormat in the house of
[39:32] God as long as I'm in the house of God
[39:35] just let me be a doormat
[39:37] and if you'll have that attitude God
[39:39] will place you somewhere all right you
[39:41] place yourself somewhere you're in
[39:43] trouble
[39:45] we've all tried every Christian every
[39:47] son every child that comes to God is
[39:48] Tried by what you're not tried by the
[39:51] devil
[39:53] that's not what that says
[39:55] you're Tried by the word
[39:58] see if you'll be loyal to it
[40:01] when The Showdown comes what decision
[40:03] are you going to make
[40:06] that's it and he that cannot stand
[40:08] chastisement but goes on with the world
[40:10] he's an illegitimate child and not a son
[40:14] and daughter of God that's why Jesus
[40:15] could look at those Pharisees and he
[40:17] knew they hated him they and they're the
[40:19] ones that killed him
[40:21] but he called him you Generation of
[40:22] Vipers
[40:24] you snakes
[40:26] John said it Jesus said it
[40:29] I'm of my father you're of another
[40:31] father that's pretty close
[40:34] and not a son and daughter of God
[40:36] certainly not now but to watch spiritual
[40:38] minded catches the word
[40:41] not the natural-minded person
[40:44] listen it's hard to come to church
[40:48] physically
[40:50] everybody with me it's hard to come to
[40:53] church physically
[40:55] you got to get up some of you have to
[40:57] drive an hour hour and a half two hours
[40:58] maybe sometimes to get to this building
[41:03] right
[41:04] you got to get ready you gotta take the
[41:07] dog out
[41:08] you got to take this out you got to fix
[41:10] something for in between Services I
[41:12] understand that
[41:14] but something inside of you ought to
[41:16] drive you to this church in order to
[41:18] drive you to get here in order to drive
[41:21] you what to not just get here for the
[41:23] formality
[41:24] but to fellowship with God in his people
[41:28] because we are sheep we have to be what
[41:30] we're hurt animals we have to be
[41:32] together all right
[41:34] and I know it's hard to come back at two
[41:36] o'clock and I know we talk about being
[41:38] sleepy but but sometimes you gotta fight
[41:42] it
[41:42] fight the thing take a knife and put it
[41:45] right here
[41:49] oh never mind
[41:51] we do pray for the sick we'll have a
[41:52] prayer line afterwards so
[41:55] bring something clean your blood up
[41:56] though because I know some of you is
[41:57] going to do that
[42:00] I know ain't right
[42:02] but it's human it's just our Humanity
[42:06] fight it to get something from God even
[42:08] if it's 15 minutes
[42:10] even if it's 15 minutes of what you
[42:12] listen to 15 minutes is yours
[42:16] and listen God knows you're gonna be
[42:18] tired
[42:20] so maybe he'll keep you awake in your
[42:22] spot
[42:23] so you can get that awake part and then
[42:26] maybe somebody else will get something
[42:27] while you're going to nod
[42:33] but look
[42:35] but the spiritual minded minded not the
[42:39] body-minded not the flesh-minded the
[42:42] what the spiritual minded catches the
[42:45] word of God lines up with it and what
[42:49] this then look let me let me paraphrase
[42:51] the spirit is happy
[42:53] the spirit is happy to come down under
[42:56] the shed blood and take that person
[42:59] be a prisoner
[43:01] be a prisoner of God
[43:03] Paul a prisoner of Christ
[43:06] each one of us look what happened to the
[43:08] children in the fire furnace they were a
[43:10] prisoner for a while
[43:14] do you know the image
[43:17] do you know what that image was
[43:19] that they refused to buy down to
[43:22] that was their buddy Daniel
[43:25] beltoshizer
[43:27] oh wouldn't that work in the message
[43:29] today
[43:33] preach anyway
[43:34] but me really look what look what and
[43:37] that's what they're going to do to me
[43:37] and you
[43:39] they're going to try to crucify us
[43:42] for not following a man
[43:47] and you got to go to a certain spot to
[43:48] get it
[43:50] folks they know you certain spot you got
[43:52] to go
[43:53] to get the word of God
[43:55] but what did it do those of us that are
[43:58] being persecuted they are being tied
[44:00] they can't get out and preach because of
[44:02] what because of the reputation of this
[44:05] place of this church or of this ministry
[44:07] not the building but the ministry
[44:11] but what it should do it should deliver
[44:13] you you know what makes you stay home
[44:15] where you can teach the home people
[44:18] man
[44:20] but the only thing you did what it
[44:22] delivered them from the bounds that they
[44:24] were bound with it was a paradox
[44:26] sometimes in our own lives that Paradox
[44:28] repeat repeats sometimes you're brought
[44:30] to a showdown where you have to make a
[44:33] decision one more time you are going to
[44:35] have to make a decision
[44:38] there's a requirement to choose as a
[44:41] free moral agent you've got to choose
[44:42] right and wrong right from wrong
[44:44] you have to stand on that decision like
[44:47] they did and it all works together for
[44:49] the good what did it do it never hurt
[44:50] them it loosed them
[44:52] amen
[44:54] sometimes we're caught in that position
[44:55] first thing you got remember the man
[44:57] drowning in a river you got the man out
[44:59] of the river before you get the river
[45:00] out of the man same thing with here you
[45:02] got to get the devil out of the man
[45:07] come out and make a stand get the thing
[45:09] out
[45:10] because listen folks we do have those
[45:12] little foxes that still spoil the vine
[45:15] we've got those little things that still
[45:17] come about us and they're demons
[45:19] they're not just they're not just a
[45:21] little floating no they're demons
[45:23] brother Brown walked into a place and
[45:26] he see him hanging in the rafters
[45:30] what demons
[45:32] ready to what dispute him
[45:35] you see what he was under that's why God
[45:37] had to give him a commission and told
[45:39] him said I'll be with you
[45:41] remember he said the ever failing word
[45:43] of God I'll be with you don't you worry
[45:45] about those demons up there and and like
[45:48] I said before somebody was saying about
[45:50] cancer you know there's a lot of people
[45:52] I had a healing campaign but there's
[45:53] nobody touched brother Randolph's
[45:55] healing campaign especially when it
[45:57] comes to cancer
[45:58] because cancer was a hard demon because
[46:00] brother Brown said the angel said he
[46:03] said he made it specific he said nothing
[46:06] will stand in your way now you could
[46:07] have just left it right there he said
[46:08] even cancer because at that time folks
[46:11] that was what 50 60 years ago cancer was
[46:14] just a word that's meant death cancer
[46:15] death that was it
[46:17] yeah man if you had a little spot on
[46:19] your arm or something uh breast cancer
[46:20] or different thing you were gone because
[46:22] there was no technology now thank God
[46:25] thank God
[46:27] that uh
[46:29] somebody was saying the other day you
[46:30] know brother Brown prayed to God to for
[46:33] men to find a cure of cancer he was
[46:34] wanting to find a cure of cancer knowing
[46:38] that what that cancer is going to go
[46:39] everywhere
[46:40] all right so now we've got doctors and
[46:42] we've got things that you say cancer now
[46:44] didn't brother Brown say cancer would be
[46:46] like a toothache before the end time
[46:49] like a toothache
[46:52] you say cancer now you got a lot better
[46:54] chance of survival than you did 60 years
[46:56] ago so God sent
[46:58] the great physician three brother
[47:00] Branham to get rid of that cancer drive
[47:03] that cancer completely out of their body
[47:04] stuff fall off on the platform
[47:08] a lady that weighed what what she
[47:10] weighed 70 pounds 60 pounds
[47:13] remember Florence nightingale's sister
[47:14] or Fort not good one right
[47:17] I mean you see the picture of her her
[47:18] legs are like this big around and dying
[47:21] of cancer and then three months later
[47:23] you see a picture of her she's just
[47:25] ready to go back to work she was a nurse
[47:26] or something but
[47:29] you don't say that now
[47:31] you really didn't see it then
[47:33] but you saw it through brother Adam's
[47:34] Ministry and now we have that same
[47:37] Authority now today folks he didn't take
[47:39] you with him
[47:40] we still should not fear cancer
[47:43] we still should not fear those words
[47:45] because you know what that word goes
[47:48] into your brain
[47:50] and it says oh
[47:52] oh
[47:54] you know and then you start thinking
[47:56] quit that stinking thinking
[47:58] it's just a word that man put on it
[48:02] all the devil
[48:04] it's all a demon and we need to talk to
[48:07] the demon talk to the sickness talk to
[48:09] the cancer not to the person
[48:11] all right
[48:13] look he's talking about letting it go he
[48:16] said that's the way it is anytime as
[48:17] long as you're going to do it in other
[48:19] words as long as you project yourself
[48:21] someone talks to you and you talk back
[48:23] about them God can't find your battle
[48:25] you're fighting it yourself
[48:27] and that's what we do
[48:29] ain't that what we do
[48:32] amen
[48:33] we fought a battle that we should never
[48:35] be in
[48:38] give it to God
[48:39] just let loose and let him do it just
[48:41] commit it to him look the greatest
[48:43] weapon that I know of a Christian today
[48:46] is a committal
[48:49] he said oh brother Brown said one time
[48:51] before the greatest weapon was faith
[48:53] well put the two quotes together
[48:56] faith is a committal to God saying God
[48:58] you've got to handle this I can't handle
[49:00] it no more it's all yours put your kids
[49:03] in his hand but listen if he knocks them
[49:06] on their
[49:07] backside
[49:08] don't go running over there
[49:10] don't go running
[49:12] please don't go running you know like
[49:15] brother Claude weissaker told me one
[49:16] time he said don't pray for him either
[49:19] because God will honor your prayer
[49:21] he said you'll take it off of them and
[49:24] God's got it on them
[49:25] he said you'll pray it off of him he
[49:27] said don't he said you pray for their
[49:28] soul
[49:29] you pray for God to have his will in the
[49:32] matter but not Lord Heal my son his son
[49:35] was going through some really bad bad
[49:37] times and he was a drug addict
[49:41] just got to commit it to God
[49:44] say God save his soul
[49:46] I I'm really not worried about it that's
[49:48] what he was saying I'm really not
[49:49] worried about his life
[49:51] human part I'm worried about a soul
[49:54] if you'll save a soul lord well he did
[49:57] come out of it and he's doing a little
[49:58] bit better now but you know people get
[50:01] caught in that he and Hannah was one my
[50:04] daughter
[50:05] she's in her late 30s and she went
[50:07] through that time of you say oh it ain't
[50:09] nothing to it yeah it is
[50:11] an addiction is an addiction I don't
[50:13] care if it's what you can name it
[50:14] whatever you want to it's an addiction
[50:15] all right and it's something you it's
[50:18] real something you have to fight
[50:21] and you have to let God help you do it
[50:23] because you can't do it on your own how
[50:25] many of how many of you have been have
[50:26] done something like I was the I was the
[50:29] cursor and I was the smoking not smoking
[50:31] anything but uh chewing tobacco that was
[50:34] what God had to take away from me
[50:36] all right and take that out
[50:38] same way with you you had a demon that
[50:41] God had to help you because there's no
[50:42] way you wanted to do it before
[50:44] we got that Inside Man hadn't been
[50:47] changed yet but once that inside man got
[50:49] changed praise the Lord let that thing
[50:51] out how many times have I been telling
[50:53] you that let it out and we get to it
[50:55] that's what we're going to talk about
[50:57] hmm
[50:59] so an Army first is getting ready for
[51:01] battle first thing he's got to be what
[51:02] select soldiers
[51:05] you're selected elected
[51:09] listen Delta Force
[51:13] um
[51:14] Marines
[51:16] will you Marie
[51:18] see there's a special people not
[51:20] everybody can be a marine right
[51:22] not everybody's going to be Delta Delta
[51:24] Force
[51:25] because they start weeding them out and
[51:27] you've got the what Elite of the elite
[51:30] well guess what that's what God's doing
[51:31] to me and you he's taking the lead of
[51:34] the elite so what about my brother don't
[51:35] worry about your brother you better
[51:37] worry about yourself
[51:41] some soldiers they got to be dressed for
[51:44] fighting
[51:45] they've got to be trained for Fighting
[51:48] by what by file full ministry and I
[51:50] believe it's the greatest battles ever
[51:52] fought is now ready to go into action we
[51:54] read this last Sunday I believe that God
[51:56] has been selecting his soldiers now
[51:59] listen a lot of us weren't born
[52:01] when did he preach this
[52:03] 1962. how many of you were not even born
[52:06] at that time
[52:09] shows you how old the rest of those are
[52:17] that's why you've got to be dressed for
[52:19] fighting
[52:20] they've got to be trained for fighting
[52:23] and I believe that the greatest battle
[52:24] has ever fought is now ready to go into
[52:26] action I believe that God has been
[52:28] selecting his soldiers
[52:30] amen I believe he's been dressing them
[52:32] training them and the Battlefront is now
[52:35] set getting ready to start now we know
[52:37] where it's at there had to be a place
[52:39] selected all right
[52:41] why was it selected in the mind
[52:45] all right we'll talk about in just a
[52:47] minute
[52:48] there's a mutual ground look no man's
[52:50] land
[52:52] Satan took the what
[52:55] brain head
[52:57] God took the heart because we're going
[52:59] to read it here in a few minutes that
[53:00] out of the heart
[53:01] proceedeth all these things good or bad
[53:06] he said bro wait what's this got to do
[53:07] with with the Statue of perfect man if
[53:09] we don't get this right
[53:10] if we don't let that what's inside of us
[53:13] out good or bad and either get rid of it
[53:15] or say look you know when you got a
[53:17] battle
[53:18] the best way
[53:21] you have a battle plan you have
[53:23] everything said just right you have the
[53:25] ground right you have everything right
[53:28] but you better have a contingency plan
[53:31] you better have a backup plan
[53:33] because if so and so is supposed to act
[53:36] this way and come this way with his army
[53:38] and he turns around and goes up on the
[53:39] hill and comes around you better figure
[53:41] out what you're going to do real quick
[53:42] so don't you think Satan is what what
[53:46] he's the greatest
[53:48] apart from the mighty conqueror he's the
[53:50] greatest battle there is
[53:52] because God was only one that defeated
[53:54] him right
[53:55] amen so you better
[53:58] be weary
[54:00] there's a Battlefront where they meet
[54:02] and test their powers where each Army
[54:05] tested strength against the other Army a
[54:07] mutual meeting place now don't miss this
[54:10] when that great battle started down
[54:11] Earth he was talking about one in heaven
[54:13] there's one on earth there had to be a
[54:15] mutual meeting place there had to be a
[54:17] place selected for the battle to begin
[54:19] and for the battle to rage now look you
[54:22] don't have a battle if Satan's in your
[54:25] soul
[54:28] come on look back when you were when
[54:30] you're not born again
[54:32] there's no Battle of Good and Evil
[54:35] oh you were trying to be morally good
[54:37] yes
[54:39] but you did Evil
[54:41] right you did Evil
[54:43] and you liked it
[54:45] it was good right
[54:49] but
[54:51] chief
[54:53] me now born again
[54:56] me now have white dog black dog
[55:00] the Battleground which one Chief wins he
[55:03] said the one I feed the most
[55:06] he wasn't talking about losing his
[55:07] salvation he's talking about his walk as
[55:09] a Christian amen and that Battleground
[55:12] begins with a human mind there's where
[55:14] the battle starts the human mind was
[55:16] chosen for the place of battle why
[55:19] because it's a neutral spot
[55:21] see how'd that happen it's a neutral
[55:23] spot
[55:24] you got here either Satan or or God not
[55:28] not not to
[55:29] we're not two Soul people and I'm saying
[55:32] heart because I'm talking about this I'm
[55:34] talking about yours we'll talk about in
[55:35] a minute your psyche your person who you
[55:37] are that's your soul who you are is the
[55:41] devil when you're born
[55:42] who you are when you're born again is
[55:44] God
[55:45] all right
[55:47] now then you take that and then right
[55:49] here is the Battleground
[55:52] all right Satan can't get to your heart
[55:55] your soul if you're born again
[55:59] but he can get to your mind because
[56:00] you're a human being
[56:02] you were born in sin shaping an iniquity
[56:04] especially mother's womb a liar you came
[56:06] contrary to the word of God Amen
[56:09] even though Jesus came the word of God
[56:12] he came the right way even though he
[56:14] came the right way
[56:16] Satan
[56:19] if you be the Son of God take him up on
[56:23] the temple said I'll give you all this
[56:24] Satan must have been pretty comfortable
[56:26] in a church because he was on top of the
[56:28] Temple
[56:29] he said I'll give you all this
[56:32] if you'll Bow Down and Worship me
[56:35] Jesus is like
[56:38] don't tempt the Lord thy God
[56:41] but where it was a decision he had to
[56:43] make
[56:44] remember brother Byron said the battle
[56:46] was fought in the Garden of Eden the
[56:48] battle was won in the Garden of Eden not
[56:50] at Calvary it was one it's about there
[56:52] at Garden of Gethsemane when he said
[56:54] father let this cup pass from me if it
[56:57] be thy will let this cup pass from me
[57:00] but nevertheless
[57:02] what happened that thing that was inside
[57:04] of him took over that human and said
[57:08] nope I gotta go because they need me
[57:10] I got Sons and Daughters of God inside
[57:12] of me and they've got to get out
[57:14] my attribute of Savior I got to go to
[57:16] Calvary my attribute is healer I've got
[57:18] to go to Calvary
[57:22] because decisions are made from the mind
[57:24] or the head decisions
[57:27] every decision you make good bad or
[57:28] indifferent comes from your brain
[57:30] about with me all right that'd be okay
[57:33] don't fall asleep on me it is warm up
[57:35] here I'm sweating a little bit
[57:37] where's Aaron when you need him
[57:40] I don't know who holds a few I know
[57:42] don't know what the future holds but I
[57:44] know who holds the future that's the
[57:46] main thing he holds all future and
[57:48] whatever mine shall be it's in his hands
[57:50] so each day I want to live not for
[57:52] myself if I live for myself I live a
[57:55] selfish life I want to live for others
[57:57] and give what strength I have not to
[57:59] myself and to my own pleasure but for
[58:02] the benefit of others that'll build the
[58:04] kingdom of God now that see you see
[58:06] where he was at he was showing where he
[58:07] was at I mean that's brotherly kindness
[58:12] he didn't care about himself
[58:14] he cared about his people
[58:18] then we know we quoted this 100 times
[58:20] we're going to quote it again you have
[58:22] to suffer the rain suffer to rain all
[58:25] right the reason for this is that
[58:26] characters simply never was made without
[58:29] suffering like I said before generals
[58:32] those five-star generals and four-star
[58:34] generals they did not get those medals
[58:36] by pushing a pencil
[58:38] and a desk 100 miles away from the
[58:41] battle
[58:42] no Patton Robert E Lee all the different
[58:45] ones they were in the heat of the battle
[58:46] and what they made decisions to win a
[58:49] war or win a battle made those decisions
[58:52] and those decisions what put them in a
[58:55] place all right
[58:58] there's Aaron Jr
[59:02] thank you Abby
[59:04] that's my niece blesser
[59:07] your face is red
[59:11] in case you didn't know that a man
[59:13] without character can't Reign because
[59:15] power apart from characters satanic
[59:17] listen God can't give you power and you
[59:20] not be able to use it
[59:22] right
[59:24] because that's what the devil did he
[59:25] gave the devil power
[59:28] permitted power and look what he did
[59:30] with it he used it wrong
[59:34] but you and I though power with
[59:36] character is fit to rule who you
[59:40] you first
[59:43] last few misnamed look that's gifts of
[59:46] God he's talking about speaking in
[59:47] tongues different things but these gifts
[59:49] of God without these virtues so without
[59:51] these virtues what was happening in the
[59:53] churches without these virtues they
[59:55] would just stand up we saw it the other
[59:56] day
[59:57] excuse me we saw it the other day that
[59:59] was one got up spoken times one one uh
[1:00:02] interpreted and it wasn't a minute later
[1:00:05] or less than three sentences later
[1:00:07] somebody else jumped up and did it again
[1:00:09] then somebody else jumped up and did it
[1:00:10] again all right it was out of place it
[1:00:12] might have met him God but it was out of
[1:00:13] place all right but if they would have
[1:00:15] had these virtues working in his life
[1:00:17] see that because it makes a stumbling
[1:00:19] block to the believer unbeliever it's
[1:00:22] not accepted by God this has to be first
[1:00:24] I believe he was pointing to that and
[1:00:26] when you have faith versions of God's
[1:00:29] brother kindness then the Holy Ghost
[1:00:30] comes down and seals you as a unit
[1:00:33] the same as he sells the church ages as
[1:00:35] a unit the main way he makes his bride
[1:00:37] is the way he makes his individual made
[1:00:39] out of the same material like he was
[1:00:41] made out of Adam a rib from the side
[1:00:43] here's the thing that you have to have
[1:00:45] first you can't impersonate them he's
[1:00:47] talking about that you can't imitate
[1:00:49] them they've got to be what God sent and
[1:00:52] God born imitation only causes confusion
[1:00:56] all right nobody with me why am I
[1:00:59] against organized religion
[1:01:02] if what is purpose to the church the
[1:01:04] life that was in Christ isn't reflecting
[1:01:06] in you don't you stand still if you
[1:01:08] haven't got patience virtue and all
[1:01:10] these things Temperance godliness
[1:01:11] Brothers kindness
[1:01:13] all these things that are required
[1:01:15] so it's a requirement we know that let
[1:01:18] me say it again it was a requirement
[1:01:21] it's a requirement for you to grow as a
[1:01:22] Christian
[1:01:25] right we've been talking about it all in
[1:01:26] your head so let's read this
[1:01:30] I added these
[1:01:31] scriptures in just this morning so I
[1:01:34] want to talk about this just a little
[1:01:35] bit Psalms 94 says look in the multitude
[1:01:39] you have been sitting here today for
[1:01:42] hour and a half
[1:01:44] and there is a multitude of thoughts
[1:01:46] that went through your head
[1:01:48] good bad or indifferent
[1:01:52] oh no I've been listening to every word
[1:01:54] you're saying
[1:01:55] okay what day is our Christmas dinner
[1:01:58] that's what I thought
[1:02:03] December the 4th I wrote it down
[1:02:07] Confucius said the shortest pencil is
[1:02:09] greater than the longest memory if you
[1:02:10] write it down you'll remember it
[1:02:13] wouldn't you say that oh and the
[1:02:15] multitude of my thoughts within me they
[1:02:19] come thy Comforts Delight my soul
[1:02:23] David in the multitude of my thoughts
[1:02:27] Within Me
[1:02:29] thy Comforts Delight My Soul David was
[1:02:33] thinking about
[1:02:35] the word of God
[1:02:37] which he had the Torah he had the five
[1:02:39] books first five books the Bible that's
[1:02:40] all he had he was writing part of it
[1:02:42] right here
[1:02:43] Isaiah 55 says let the wicked forsake
[1:02:45] his way and the unrighteous man his
[1:02:47] thoughts thoughts
[1:02:49] and let him return unto the Lord and He
[1:02:51] will have mercy upon him and to our God
[1:02:54] for he will abundantly pardon remember
[1:02:57] what brother Brown said he said they
[1:02:59] said brother how can I keep these evil
[1:03:02] dirty thoughts from happening he said
[1:03:03] you can't you can't
[1:03:06] keep the bird from flying over your head
[1:03:08] but you can keep it from making a nest
[1:03:10] in your head
[1:03:11] did everybody understand that because
[1:03:13] what we did was we still have this
[1:03:16] I'm going to say it anyway we still have
[1:03:18] some of the same thoughts we had when we
[1:03:19] were in the world
[1:03:21] hello
[1:03:23] amen well I'll say amen for you anyway
[1:03:26] but what do we do we don't entertain
[1:03:28] them
[1:03:29] because when because when we were when
[1:03:31] we were in the world we what oh yeah
[1:03:35] quiet beer be good today yeah y'all just
[1:03:37] get me a beer I'll go and I'll go and uh
[1:03:40] and cut this guy out or or run somebody
[1:03:42] off the road you see what I mean
[1:03:45] you might still have the same thoughts
[1:03:46] about you want to run somebody off the
[1:03:47] road that's okay just don't do it
[1:03:52] but what do you do you yield to what's
[1:03:54] inside of you the motivator
[1:03:56] that's what we're going to talk about
[1:03:57] just for a minute and then we'll close
[1:04:00] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[1:04:03] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:04:05] return unto the Lord and He will have
[1:04:07] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[1:04:09] will abundantly pardon now God said for
[1:04:12] my thoughts
[1:04:13] that's what we got to turn to that
[1:04:16] thought
[1:04:17] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:04:20] all right so there's there's where's
[1:04:21] that right here pull it apart neither
[1:04:24] are your ways my ways
[1:04:27] I saith the Lord for as the heavens are
[1:04:30] higher than the earth so are my waves
[1:04:32] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:04:34] than your thoughts
[1:04:37] James 1 verse 6 is
[1:04:39] but let him ask in faith nothing
[1:04:41] wavering for he that waverth is like a
[1:04:43] wave of the seed driven with the wind
[1:04:44] and toss for let not that man think that
[1:04:47] he shall receive anything of the Lord
[1:04:48] because a double-minded man is unstable
[1:04:51] in all his ways unstable a double-minded
[1:04:56] now double-minded means right there
[1:05:00] wavering uncertain doubting and divided
[1:05:04] in interest
[1:05:06] I think I should I think I should not
[1:05:12] the two the demon and the angel sitting
[1:05:15] on your shoulder
[1:05:16] divided in interest but now who wins
[1:05:20] the one you feed
[1:05:22] because that conscience that comes into
[1:05:23] your conscience or into your thought it
[1:05:25] comes into your thought and what you
[1:05:27] either entertain it
[1:05:29] or you kick it out
[1:05:30] wanted to tell you when you've done it
[1:05:32] while we were all we're all human beings
[1:05:37] but how many of you though have
[1:05:39] entertained the thought and never even
[1:05:40] come to pass never even come up that way
[1:05:41] it never was done that way never was
[1:05:43] even never was even nowhere you thought
[1:05:46] you wasted your time thinking about all
[1:05:47] that
[1:05:50] oh I'm not the only one who does that
[1:05:53] we waste a lot of our time on negative
[1:05:55] thoughts
[1:05:57] I'll say amen for everybody in the
[1:05:58] building we waste our time on negative
[1:06:02] thoughts
[1:06:03] so brother Branham what do we need to do
[1:06:05] what's the recipe
[1:06:07] right mental attitude
[1:06:11] now the right mental attitude
[1:06:13] he's talking about the prayer line now
[1:06:14] you along here do you understand what I
[1:06:16] mean when I say the right mental
[1:06:17] attitude your right mental attitude
[1:06:19] toward God's Divine promise now it's
[1:06:20] toward a promise not toward anything
[1:06:23] will bring any promise to pass
[1:06:26] because look healing is not conditional
[1:06:29] that you're saved
[1:06:32] come on
[1:06:34] saying to this mountain be removed it's
[1:06:36] not conditional
[1:06:37] it said if you say
[1:06:39] if you believe in your heart
[1:06:42] lay hands on the seat they shall recover
[1:06:46] now maybe you don't believe that you say
[1:06:48] well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:52] see don't let the devil know that
[1:06:55] always say I've got good faith he said
[1:06:58] oh you're lying no you're lying if you
[1:06:59] don't
[1:07:01] I believe God with all my heart see
[1:07:03] don't testify nothing of the devil
[1:07:06] when you accept your healing never act
[1:07:09] like you're sick or crippled anymore
[1:07:10] believe that you're healed take him at
[1:07:13] his word then it's all over on God then
[1:07:15] and not on you wow
[1:07:17] as long as you take God this word then
[1:07:19] the word will produce what it promised
[1:07:22] to do that's what I'm talking about you
[1:07:24] know we're talking about healing we're
[1:07:25] going to talk about healing we talked
[1:07:27] about healing of our soul that's the new
[1:07:29] birth right we're going to talk about
[1:07:30] healing now of our spirit realm remember
[1:07:31] reaches causes affection because that's
[1:07:33] where this is going to be
[1:07:34] is that right now have faith believing
[1:07:36] with all your heart Queen of Sheba 1961.
[1:07:40] always remember Church God's words are
[1:07:43] true I believe the right mental attitude
[1:07:45] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:07:47] bring it to pass look if you can look at
[1:07:49] it in the right way
[1:07:52] but remember he's been my standard in
[1:07:54] life I have tried to do this this is
[1:07:56] when I told you if you had a situation I
[1:07:58] read this the other day I'm gonna read
[1:07:59] it again the first thing I want to find
[1:08:01] out whether it's the will of God or not
[1:08:03] if you need to if you need something
[1:08:05] from God today
[1:08:07] if we believe God sent a prophet We
[1:08:08] believe We he gave us life lessons also
[1:08:12] then I know it's God's will
[1:08:14] the next thing is my objective to it and
[1:08:17] my motive in doing it
[1:08:21] right
[1:08:23] and my motive is right it's the will of
[1:08:26] God my objective right my motive right I
[1:08:28] have faith that will be done
[1:08:30] because first it's the will of God
[1:08:33] and I have my objective is to glorify
[1:08:35] him and my motive is to give him all the
[1:08:38] glory
[1:08:39] I told you the situation about the
[1:08:41] brother in another church that said he
[1:08:43] was going to go to work on Sunday and
[1:08:44] get paid double time so he could pay the
[1:08:46] pay the uh send offering to the missions
[1:08:49] he was all right in two points
[1:08:52] but he missed the very first one
[1:08:55] the will of God was not for him to stay
[1:08:57] out of church
[1:08:58] amen so he missed it on the first one he
[1:09:00] might have got it on the second one
[1:09:01] second one or the third one sure he had
[1:09:04] him he had a motive
[1:09:05] take the money give it all the missions
[1:09:07] but he stayed out of church look he
[1:09:10] became spiritually he's a desert
[1:09:14] just now coming back to church
[1:09:17] been in church all his life
[1:09:20] because first is the will of God and I
[1:09:22] have my objective is to glorify him and
[1:09:24] my motive is to give him all the glory
[1:09:25] what are you saying by the way that's
[1:09:27] right here
[1:09:28] what is your motive and objective is to
[1:09:31] know more than the next Church
[1:09:36] is to know more about God
[1:09:38] and then let the other churches see that
[1:09:40] we're different
[1:09:41] I'm talking about denomination churches
[1:09:43] and churches in the message all right
[1:09:47] and my objective is to glorify him and
[1:09:49] my motive is to give him all the glory
[1:09:50] see so there's no selfish motive about
[1:09:53] it if you have a selfish motive it ain't
[1:09:55] going to work
[1:09:56] shorts the father 1963 the word Jesus
[1:09:58] said is the seed that the sower sowed
[1:10:00] look in any germatized seed in the right
[1:10:03] kind of soil
[1:10:04] will produce its kind
[1:10:07] now look he's talking about being taped
[1:10:09] and it's going to be thousands are going
[1:10:10] to listen to it he just was prophesying
[1:10:12] I go on record I say this about the word
[1:10:15] of God being a seed if you can take the
[1:10:17] right mental attitude toward any Divine
[1:10:19] promise of God he will bring it to pass
[1:10:22] look if you can get yourself in
[1:10:25] possession to believe that that promise
[1:10:28] was for you
[1:10:30] so you got it's a condition you got to
[1:10:32] believe that that promise is for you
[1:10:35] all right and God's going to equip us
[1:10:38] for the battle just a few things we know
[1:10:39] that so we see that it's a requirement
[1:10:41] all these things brother Donnie had to
[1:10:43] have shells and gun and and canteen and
[1:10:45] whatever else he needed that's what
[1:10:47] everybody's what God the United States
[1:10:50] gave him what to go to battle with
[1:10:53] ah bro Donnie you going out there in
[1:10:55] your skivvies and you and your T-shirt
[1:10:56] we'll bring you what brain we'll bring
[1:10:59] it to you when you need it
[1:11:00] no
[1:11:03] you got ready before the battle started
[1:11:06] because you knew the battle was
[1:11:08] impending you knew when the battle was
[1:11:10] going to be almost and you knew to get
[1:11:12] ready for it well same way with me and
[1:11:13] you we know the battle we know it's here
[1:11:15] we know it's to us an everyday thing
[1:11:20] shogun's requirement how we can come to
[1:11:23] the perfect stature of a perfect man
[1:11:25] before God
[1:11:26] now we were talking about ad
[1:11:28] that word add is not like two plus two
[1:11:32] is four
[1:11:33] all right so what does it mean in the
[1:11:35] Greek Alaskan it means to minister
[1:11:38] Minister nourishment
[1:11:40] so add minister to your faith virtue you
[1:11:43] got to get it from a minister Minister
[1:11:46] unto to supply furnish and present add
[1:11:50] to be supplied ministered unto and
[1:11:53] assisted
[1:11:54] and as we said before this is a really
[1:11:57] good quote from the minister from the
[1:12:00] internet wasn't a message preacher
[1:12:02] but I like the quote a person a virtue
[1:12:04] makes the progression from knowing what
[1:12:06] is right to doing what is right
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:12] but look he or she intentionally
[1:12:15] chooses what to say do in value
[1:12:19] you can either shut it off today and
[1:12:21] just just be born again and you can sit
[1:12:23] there and and people will just run right
[1:12:25] past you
[1:12:26] or you can say God it's all for me
[1:12:31] fill my cup Lord raise it up like Sister
[1:12:34] Barbara some of y'all's cup never will
[1:12:35] get full
[1:12:37] pour it on me Lord well it's just going
[1:12:39] to run off that side
[1:12:41] but if you raise them hands up guess
[1:12:43] what you made a cup
[1:12:44] and your head is in the middle of it
[1:12:49] drown me in you Lord because if you
[1:12:51] drown me in you I'm okay
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:55] he or she intentionally chooses what to
[1:12:57] say do in value reaching beyond the good
[1:13:00] toward the best
[1:13:02] what brother Brown say he's getting the
[1:13:03] best soldiers ready all right in every
[1:13:07] situation a virtuous person knows what
[1:13:09] they have an opportunity that they have
[1:13:11] an opportunity to honor the Lord and
[1:13:14] reflect him to others and that's what it
[1:13:16] is right living for others and and
[1:13:19] virtue now not the virtue at the bottom
[1:13:21] but these are all called virtues these
[1:13:24] are the virtues of God so virtues means
[1:13:26] moral Excellence value Merit
[1:13:28] meritiveness and worth active quality or
[1:13:31] power what power without what character
[1:13:33] is satanic capacity or power adequate to
[1:13:38] the production of a given effect
[1:13:42] you got to come to the statute perfect
[1:13:43] man before that headstone is going to
[1:13:45] come down on top
[1:13:46] it can't come down on the base
[1:13:49] it's got to come down on what somebody
[1:13:51] that's mature
[1:13:53] mature bride
[1:13:57] energy strength potency efficacy as the
[1:14:01] virtue of a medicine specifically this
[1:14:03] is their moral Excellence Integrity of
[1:14:06] character purity of Soul performance of
[1:14:10] Duty all right let's talk about this
[1:14:12] just for a minute and then we'll then
[1:14:14] we'll dismissal this afternoon
[1:14:16] because remember your heart or your soul
[1:14:18] is the same thing everybody with me on
[1:14:20] that all right heart and soul same same
[1:14:22] word in Bible and in our terms
[1:14:25] but now remember there's only Faith or
[1:14:27] doubt in that Soul all right let's back
[1:14:29] it down into the soul so let's read this
[1:14:32] right here
[1:14:34] Matthew 15 verse 17 just for a second
[1:14:36] do not ye yet understand that whosoever
[1:14:39] entereth in at the mouth goeth whatever
[1:14:41] inner into the mouth and goes out the
[1:14:43] belly and cast out in the drop
[1:14:46] they were talking about eating stuff and
[1:14:48] all that but those things which proceed
[1:14:50] out of the mouth come forth from the
[1:14:52] heart and they defile the man
[1:14:55] for out of the heart perceives evil
[1:14:58] thoughts
[1:15:00] murder
[1:15:01] adulteries fornication
[1:15:06] theft
[1:15:08] false witness
[1:15:10] blasphemies wow
[1:15:12] these are the things which defile a man
[1:15:14] but to eat with unwashed hands defileth
[1:15:16] not a man all right
[1:15:18] Romans 6 verse 16 said no you not that
[1:15:21] to whom you yield yourself servant to
[1:15:23] obey his servants you are to whom you
[1:15:25] obey what you talking about the inner
[1:15:27] man whether of sin unto death or of
[1:15:30] obedience unto righteousness but God be
[1:15:33] thanked
[1:15:35] that you were the Servants of sin
[1:15:38] but you have obeyed from the heart
[1:15:42] that form of Doctrine which was
[1:15:45] delivered unto you
[1:15:49] listen you were changed by a Doctrine
[1:15:55] I don't care if you were born again you
[1:15:58] were born again by a Doctrine
[1:16:01] you want me to prove it brother Brian
[1:16:02] said Jesus is first Doctrine
[1:16:05] which you must be born again
[1:16:09] you must be born again let's get that
[1:16:10] Doctrine
[1:16:12] Doctrine I believe we're
[1:16:16] to the plane that you have obeyed from
[1:16:18] the heart that form of Doctrine which
[1:16:19] was delivered unto you being then made
[1:16:21] free from sin thank God you become the
[1:16:24] Servants of righteousness I speak after
[1:16:26] the manner of man because of the
[1:16:28] infirmity
[1:16:29] of your flesh
[1:16:31] now he's not discluding the flesh
[1:16:34] you got it
[1:16:35] is here today most of you with your eyes
[1:16:38] closed
[1:16:40] I hope you're praying for me
[1:16:43] look for you as you have yielded your
[1:16:46] members servants to uncleanness and to
[1:16:48] iniquity unto iniquity this direction
[1:16:50] even so now yield your members servants
[1:16:53] to righteousness and Holiness and I want
[1:16:56] to read the definition and it will stand
[1:16:58] and musicians can come the word Greek
[1:17:01] word is cardia where do you think we get
[1:17:03] Cardiology
[1:17:06] now buy with me
[1:17:08] cardia
[1:17:09] Cardiology what of the heart
[1:17:12] but look here's the definition I want
[1:17:14] you to read this or read it with me
[1:17:18] denotes the center
[1:17:20] of all physical and spiritual life so we
[1:17:23] know there's a physical heart
[1:17:25] but there's also the heart of an apple
[1:17:29] right so there's you can say heart
[1:17:31] different ways
[1:17:32] but now watch this it separates it
[1:17:35] the center and seat of spiritual life
[1:17:38] the soul
[1:17:40] our mind
[1:17:41] as it is the fountain
[1:17:45] fountain
[1:17:46] what's a fountain a fountain has to have
[1:17:48] an original place where water begins
[1:17:49] then it comes up and it goes out right
[1:17:52] so there's an origination of a fountain
[1:17:55] there's a place where it starts it
[1:17:57] doesn't just start out in the air and
[1:17:58] start spurting water no it's got a place
[1:17:59] down here that it starts from what your
[1:18:01] soul
[1:18:03] it is the Fountain and Seed of the
[1:18:05] thoughts passions desires now the seed
[1:18:07] is not where you
[1:18:09] do it but it's where it begins
[1:18:13] everybody with me thoughts passions
[1:18:15] desires appetites affections purposes
[1:18:18] endeavors
[1:18:20] of the understanding the faculty and
[1:18:23] Seed of the intelligence
[1:18:26] as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:18:29] so is he not up here down here
[1:18:34] of the Soul so far as it is affected and
[1:18:37] stirred in a bad way
[1:18:39] or a good way
[1:18:41] are of the Soul as the seat of the
[1:18:44] sensibilities
[1:18:45] affections emotions desires appetites
[1:18:48] and passions are the middle or Center or
[1:18:51] innermost part of anything even though
[1:18:53] inanimate which is the core of an apple
[1:18:55] or the heart of an apple or the heart of
[1:18:56] a pear or the heart of a peach everybody
[1:18:58] with me all right
[1:19:00] let's read what Jesus said about this
[1:19:03] whole Generation of Vipers how can ye
[1:19:06] being evil speak good things for out of
[1:19:08] the abundance
[1:19:10] of your fountain
[1:19:13] the mouth speaketh
[1:19:15] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:19:17] the heart bringeth forth good things and
[1:19:19] an evil man out of the evil Treasures
[1:19:22] bringeth forth what
[1:19:23] evil things
[1:19:25] so I wrote myself a note it affects your
[1:19:27] senses which is what memory reason
[1:19:29] conscious affection imagination you've
[1:19:31] got one sense in the soul an originator
[1:19:33] a fountain somewhere where these things
[1:19:35] start where your thoughts begin
[1:19:39] your thoughts don't begin up here it
[1:19:40] begins and you're Who You Are
[1:19:42] right then it goes up to what Fountain
[1:19:45] of memory reason conscious imagination
[1:19:48] affection it all just spurts out from
[1:19:50] that middle that's why the inside guy
[1:19:52] has to be changed listen
[1:19:56] your source of water had to be changed
[1:20:01] didn't that Jesus said said how can
[1:20:04] bitter water
[1:20:06] come out of a good well
[1:20:07] how can good water come out of a better
[1:20:10] well what are you talking about the will
[1:20:11] of you let's stand to our feet The Well
[1:20:14] of you
[1:20:15] out of the heart
[1:20:17] we'll proceed these virtues but you've
[1:20:20] got to let them go through what the
[1:20:23] filter of your of your mind that's what
[1:20:25] we're going to talk about the filter of
[1:20:27] your mind in your memory your reason
[1:20:29] your conscience affects your imagination
[1:20:30] but remember as God is pushing up this
[1:20:33] way
[1:20:34] even if you're born again as God is
[1:20:36] pushing up this way with water so is
[1:20:38] Satan taking something else and coming
[1:20:40] this way with it
[1:20:41] and where do they meet they meet right
[1:20:44] there memory reasoning conscious
[1:20:46] imagination and affection
[1:20:49] that's where it meets and that's where
[1:20:51] the Battleground is and we'll talk about
[1:20:53] let me read this right here I'm going to
[1:20:54] read it back this afternoon now listen
[1:20:57] brother Brown's talking about
[1:21:00] dying naturally
[1:21:04] but didn't we have to die spiritually
[1:21:07] first
[1:21:08] so let's read this as dying spiritually
[1:21:10] now the only thing you do when you die
[1:21:13] you just change those five senses
[1:21:16] Glory
[1:21:18] you just receive another sense
[1:21:22] think about being born again
[1:21:24] and you're alive with a higher sense now
[1:21:27] he's talking about somebody dying going
[1:21:29] into the sixth Dimension and your senses
[1:21:30] are expanded let's talk about being born
[1:21:32] again here I want my senses expanded
[1:21:35] here not over there
[1:21:36] I want to grow in Grace in all his hair
[1:21:39] I don't have to I won't be growing over
[1:21:40] there
[1:21:42] and you're alive with a higher sense
[1:21:44] thousands of times higher than this in
[1:21:47] another life
[1:21:49] a life where there's no death no sorrow
[1:21:52] the things that you don't know nothing
[1:21:54] about now you see it plainly when you
[1:21:57] cross there didn't you say don't you see
[1:22:00] things plainly now
[1:22:01] you don't have to say over there in the
[1:22:03] sixth Dimension you see him now
[1:22:04] we see him plainly by what by the word
[1:22:07] of God and I'll read the rest of it
[1:22:09] later on but there's your
[1:22:12] it affects your senses
[1:22:14] and the fountain you start with
[1:22:16] whatever your water is bitter is going
[1:22:18] to what produce bitter memory better
[1:22:22] reasoning better Consciousness bitter
[1:22:25] imagination and bitter affection you're
[1:22:27] just going to be the bitterest person in
[1:22:28] the world because you're bitter at
[1:22:30] everything you're bitter at everybody
[1:22:34] you don't have no joy you'll have no
[1:22:37] peace you know why because you caught
[1:22:38] your flus up
[1:22:40] because that fountain down inside of you
[1:22:41] is joy peace long suffering all those
[1:22:44] different things and it's wanting to
[1:22:45] push itself out
[1:22:47] but what we have a filter
[1:22:51] in the greatest battle
[1:22:53] remember brother Brown preached a
[1:22:55] thinking man's filter
[1:22:57] a thinking man's filter
[1:23:02] I want my memory
[1:23:05] to be toward good
[1:23:08] I want my reasoning the Bible does say
[1:23:10] and we'll talk about later come and let
[1:23:12] us reason together all right
[1:23:16] my conscience
[1:23:18] we need to have a clear conscience right
[1:23:19] you know what we still have a clear
[1:23:21] conscience
[1:23:22] if you get the brotherly kindness and
[1:23:24] you don't have a clear conscience you're
[1:23:25] not going to get brotherly kindness
[1:23:28] I believe brother Brown had a clear
[1:23:30] conscience to man because he never had
[1:23:32] anything to say bad about anybody if he
[1:23:35] did he's already forgiven all that I'm
[1:23:36] talking about right at the end he said I
[1:23:38] have no bitterness
[1:23:39] no gal no bitterness toward anybody I'm
[1:23:42] not going to talk about you these people
[1:23:44] anymore I'm not going to call these
[1:23:46] people ricketters and Ricky's Lord
[1:23:47] You've condemned me for that I'm not
[1:23:49] going to call that anymore
[1:23:51] ma'am he came to a place that he had his
[1:23:54] memory reasoning conscious his
[1:23:56] imagination and affection was all turned
[1:23:59] toward God more than to me than anybody
[1:24:01] on the face of the Earth outside of
[1:24:03] Jesus Christ at that time
[1:24:05] all right but why did he preach it to me
[1:24:07] and you so that he could tell it by
[1:24:09] himself no
[1:24:11] remember he was not selfish
[1:24:13] he gave this so that we could have it
[1:24:16] and then God helped him open the seals
[1:24:18] so that we can see where this is coming
[1:24:20] from we can see what Fountain what what
[1:24:23] memory is supposed to do we can see that
[1:24:25] we had a we have a soul then we have a
[1:24:27] spirit and then we have a body where
[1:24:29] Triumph being and he knew these
[1:24:32] sentences were going to be affected by
[1:24:34] what's deep down inside of us that's why
[1:24:36] I said before folks you're going to
[1:24:38] produce whatever water you got inside of
[1:24:41] you is going to burst forth whether you
[1:24:44] want it to or not
[1:24:45] good or bad bitter
[1:24:49] you've seen people are just bitter why
[1:24:51] be bitter
[1:24:53] why be bitter well somebody did
[1:24:55] something to me
[1:24:59] Jesus how many times we forgive them
[1:25:01] people that cut me off the road on the
[1:25:03] road
[1:25:04] 70 times he said nope
[1:25:08] 70 times 7 and then more if you need it
[1:25:12] I said um
[1:25:13] that's 490 times
[1:25:16] we've never got to that spot have we
[1:25:18] that's what I thought we're heading
[1:25:20] there though
[1:25:21] where you get to where
[1:25:23] you look at a prophet of God he was a
[1:25:26] prophet he knew those people didn't like
[1:25:28] him he knew those people were going to
[1:25:29] talk about him he actually probably was
[1:25:31] projected into their living room one day
[1:25:33] and they didn't know nothing about it
[1:25:35] and God let him hear
[1:25:37] what was going on
[1:25:39] because remember what he said
[1:25:41] he said those ministers are going to
[1:25:44] challenge you
[1:25:45] on water baptism right so-and-so is
[1:25:48] going to be sitting here you're not
[1:25:49] going to have the place so-and-so is
[1:25:50] going to be sitting here this is going
[1:25:51] to be sitting here and you won't be able
[1:25:53] to get the to get the hall
[1:25:55] and when he told that brother the
[1:25:56] brother said brother Brown we already
[1:25:57] paid for it well guess what it happened
[1:25:59] exactly the way brother Rand said it
[1:26:00] happened and he knew them 300 preachers
[1:26:02] but with compassion he preached that
[1:26:05] sermon not bitter to nobody
[1:26:10] he could have called him vipers he could
[1:26:12] have called him Snakes in the Grass and
[1:26:14] knew that it was the truth
[1:26:16] but yet he said them 300 ministers are
[1:26:18] going to come down and get baptized he
[1:26:20] knew they wasn't going to but he gave
[1:26:22] him a chance he gave him an opportunity
[1:26:25] to turn that thing around but he knew
[1:26:27] that's the way the same thing with God
[1:26:29] God knew the children of Israel was
[1:26:31] going to hate him he knew they were not
[1:26:32] going to go to the promised land yet he
[1:26:34] treated them just like his children
[1:26:36] he gave him everything they needed to
[1:26:38] get there that's why one day they can't
[1:26:40] say you didn't you didn't give me the
[1:26:42] right Provisions we can't say you didn't
[1:26:44] give me the right provision we have to
[1:26:46] say oh God this is where I missed it at
[1:26:48] this is where I fell and this is where I
[1:26:51] failed amen
