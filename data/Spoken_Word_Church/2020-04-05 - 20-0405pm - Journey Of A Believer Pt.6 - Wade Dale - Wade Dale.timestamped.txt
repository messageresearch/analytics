[2:00] I think brothers like gonna tell us
[2:03] about his dream he had so come right on
[2:08] up here I know you got to be instant in
[2:10] season that was season buddy come on up
[2:12] here tell him all right so uh I wasn't
[2:18] really planning on doing this but guess
[2:23] so a couple nights ago I had this dream
[2:29] and I didn't really think of it being
[2:32] spiritual at the time but in my dream I
[2:37] was at this big table is this long table
[2:41] filled with food it was really good food
[2:45] just like anything you can think of
[2:49] pretty much like I'm just like a
[2:52] Thanksgiving dinner
[2:53] pretty much just really good quality
[2:56] food and I had a plate before me and I
[2:58] was just putting food on my plate as
[3:01] much as I could possibly eat and I just
[3:04] started eating it and eating and I was
[3:07] sitting there for what felt like in my
[3:10] dream to be like hours hours of just
[3:13] eating and I couldn't get enough I was
[3:15] just I realized I looked down on my
[3:19] stomach and I was like where does all
[3:20] this food going I was like I don't even
[3:22] know where it's going and I was just
[3:25] like but I can't I can't stop eating and
[3:27] I just wasn't
[3:28] I was just continuously hungry and my
[3:32] hunger wasn't going away and I didn't
[3:34] want to stop eating and the food was
[3:35] just so good and I was just sitting
[3:37] there like I can't stop like this is
[3:39] just amazing all this food it's so good
[3:43] and so yeah then my dream stopped but I
[3:49] was just yeah it was just a dream about
[3:52] me eating continuously then I told my
[3:55] mom later on and she was like wow that
[3:57] sounds spiritual
[3:58] and I was like you know what it does I
[4:00] didn't really think about that before
[4:01] and then I told my dad about it and he
[4:02] said the same thing but uh yeah anyway
[4:06] yeah young man don't see dreams the old
[4:19] man whatever it is he's young man so
[4:23] let's stand to our feet and turn me on
[4:30] turn that back off there we go all right
[4:33] let's go to Galatians three by way of
[4:35] announcements a couple of things number
[4:38] one let's remember our nurses of this
[4:42] church here they're on the front lines
[4:44] and also the doctors and the nurses and
[4:47] doctors around the country they're
[4:50] fighting a battle just like if it was a
[4:52] warfare and it's there staring death in
[5:00] the face every day so so we want to to
[5:05] pray for them and also pray for pray for
[5:09] the people that are running the country
[5:11] I mean that the Bible tells us to pray
[5:13] for the people there in position of
[5:15] power
[5:15] so let's don't degrade them and
[5:18] downgrade them and I wish I wish one
[5:22] time Trump would have them idiot
[5:24] reporters stand up therefore he was
[5:26] standing and let them tell the country
[5:29] how they would want it run right so the
[5:32] best thing to do is just all stick
[5:33] together pray for the people that are
[5:35] trying to you know they're in power so
[5:37] we need to pray for him and pray that
[5:40] they'll make the right decision I I was
[5:42] reading in Leviticus and we've said it
[5:46] many times but that's the way my prayer
[5:48] ends every day as Lord stay this thing
[5:52] there was a plague went through the land
[5:54] many times when the people weren't doing
[5:57] what they were supposed to do and God
[5:58] was send to plague through or he would
[6:00] send snakes through to bite them and
[6:03] because of the sin of the people but
[6:06] then Moses having grace for the people
[6:09] he said Aaron grab your sensor and run
[6:11] through the crowd to stay the to stay
[6:14] the the plague but by the time Aaron
[6:17] would get out there they would be in one
[6:19] instance there were six thousand people
[6:21] killed and in one instance there was
[6:22] twenty thousand people killed so there's
[6:25] what I'm saying is this we can you say
[6:27] well your prayers not doing any good
[6:29] people are still dying well we're
[6:31] praying that God somewhere down the line
[6:32] is gonna stay this thing so that L the
[6:36] numbers will start going down and the
[6:37] people with dead they're human beings
[6:39] and they're dying alone I mean there's
[6:42] nobody there to be with them no family
[6:45] member the poor nurses and doctors are
[6:47] having to stand there while they're
[6:49] taking their last breath
[6:51] Satan's an evil person so we need to
[6:55] pray that that God will stay this thing
[6:58] pray that we'll get back to our normal C
[7:01] or something like normalcy don't know if
[7:04] that's gonna ever be the same anymore
[7:07] but it's like me and brother Brad Powell
[7:09] was talking last night this this is
[7:12] setting in motion a lot of things that
[7:14] we would have never thought of before so
[7:16] this is setting in motion some things
[7:18] that can come later down the line
[7:20] they're making things that what's going
[7:22] to happen later on down the road that's
[7:25] going to affect us so we pray now that
[7:26] that now though Lord stay those deaths
[7:30] state don't don't let don't let the
[7:32] people die like they're saying now one
[7:33] in two million people in the world may
[7:36] die before this thing is over with so
[7:37] let's just pray that God will stay that
[7:40] because they're like I said they're
[7:41] human beings they're your neighbors
[7:43] they're you know we hadn't had any
[7:44] hasn't had any deaths locally and we
[7:48] thank God for that there was a few
[7:50] hundred cases in Hall County but there's
[7:51] zero deaths three in Banks County and
[7:54] different surrounding counties so we're
[7:56] not being hit hard but New York six
[7:58] hundred people died yesterday just of
[8:01] the virus so we want to really pray for
[8:04] those people and keep them in our hearts
[8:07] it's a solemn time but like brother Dale
[8:08] said is this an exciting time because
[8:11] we've already read about this we got we
[8:14] don't need a newspaper we've already
[8:16] been told what's gonna happen we just
[8:18] haven't been told kind of like Abraham
[8:20] with God God told Abram he was going to
[8:22] have a promise son but you really didn't
[8:24] tell
[8:24] I was gonna do it until he got further
[8:26] into the journey and then when he become
[8:28] Abraham and become more intimate with
[8:30] God and our walk with God in our new
[8:33] birth then God started talking
[8:35] intimately to Abraham and said hey
[8:36] you're gonna have the promised son
[8:38] you're gonna have it and just within the
[8:40] time of life and you're gonna have it
[8:42] with Sarah not Sarah and Hagar so the
[8:46] way that's what God's been doing now
[8:47] since the Prophet left I believe he's
[8:49] turning all of our attention Abraham and
[8:52] telling us exactly how it's gonna be
[8:54] done all right so let's look in the
[8:56] journey still of a believer in part six
[8:58] good to be in a house reward good to
[8:59] have everybody with us in Galatians 3
[9:02] verse 16 but let's bow our heads and
[9:04] pray - if you want next Sunday if we do
[9:10] if it does come that we're going to do
[9:12] this in the parking lot if you need your
[9:14] CDs or anything like that you need to
[9:17] let us know Richards runs some but not a
[9:20] lot but you should be all watching
[9:22] online and it will be still online if
[9:24] you want to watch it again but next
[9:28] Sunday we'll have to really be careful
[9:29] so we'll be giving more detail of what
[9:32] we need you to do in the coming days if
[9:35] we do have it in the parking lot we're
[9:38] going to try to do it for brother Dale
[9:39] kind of stands up on a platform at the
[9:42] pecan tree and then you can park around
[9:44] him and then we're gonna try to get FM
[9:46] transmitter to go into your car so that
[9:49] we don't have to blast it all over the
[9:50] place but it'll go straight into your
[9:52] car and you can listen and keep your
[9:54] social distance thing if you need to go
[9:56] to the restroom one at a time and we're
[9:59] gonna find out if y'all really need to
[10:00] go to the bathroom now brother Dale gets
[10:04] that temp Reese it's about an hour and a
[10:05] half and nobody goes the bathroom guess
[10:06] what's gonna happen when y'all come back
[10:08] in here we're gonna expect the same
[10:11] thing so I've always said you can sit
[10:15] for two hours and watch a movie and
[10:16] never never think about going the
[10:19] bathroom but once you get in here about
[10:20] every five minutes you really need you
[10:22] have to go the bathroom anyway god bless
[10:23] you let's go to Galatians but and all of
[10:26] our dates of our Spring Fling probably
[10:28] is not going to happen the party for
[10:31] brother Dale is probably not going to
[10:32] happen at the moment we'll just postpone
[10:34] it until they begin to release
[10:37] and our prayers you know prayers and
[10:39] doing the right thing and don't provoke
[10:41] God
[10:42] don't provoke God and try to go out like
[10:45] I said we need we have faith we have
[10:48] faith but when you reach your hand in
[10:51] the oven you have an oven mitt on
[10:53] because God give you sense enough to use
[10:57] it and we don't go stand out in the
[10:59] middle of the road and say God's gonna
[11:00] take care of me we'll be doing your
[11:02] funeral probably but faith to me faith
[11:06] is right now it's kind of is a momentary
[11:08] thing if there was a child run out in
[11:10] the road or if you did have somebody
[11:11] fall in the fire you could reach in and
[11:13] grab them out of the fire and nobody
[11:15] would be hurt to me that's faith that
[11:17] what you're doing that God will protect
[11:19] you the same way with being on the
[11:20] highway you know people get killed on a
[11:23] highway all the time how many miles have
[11:24] we run for years and never even had an
[11:27] accident never even had a anything close
[11:30] to being real severe on the highway so
[11:33] God's took care of us and I believe he
[11:35] will continue to take care of us in this
[11:38] journey that we're on we're getting
[11:39] ready to get to the end of the journey
[11:40] but we've still got a journey to go to
[11:43] so let's remember also the Bur little
[11:46] bride around the world it's having to do
[11:47] the same identical thing and some people
[11:50] are not fortunate enough to have live
[11:52] streaming so maybe they're streaming in
[11:54] with us or brother Donnie or some of the
[11:56] ones so we thank God for the technology
[11:58] you were able to do this let's bow our
[12:00] heads do Heavenly Father thank you for
[12:01] this day that we're in and not just a
[12:04] 24-hour day the day of the Lord this is
[12:07] the day of the bride Lord for us to be
[12:10] made manifest so I pray Lord that our
[12:12] prayers that are going up to you around
[12:15] the world Lord that we're all in one
[12:17] heart and one mind now that we need to
[12:20] get back in service Lord I I truly Lord
[12:23] I I'm sorry but I'm going to say this I
[12:25] truly can't see how somebody can sit at
[12:26] home I just don't see how you can sit at
[12:30] home all the time and not have communion
[12:33] with your brothers and sisters in a
[12:34] house of prayer in a house of worship
[12:36] Lord we are we're fulfilling the Bible
[12:40] when we come together and congregate

[12:53] branham said about jonas salk in the
[12:55] vaccine that he came up with that that

[14:10] that you would just be with that group
[14:12] of people Lord bless your little bride

[14:19] supernatural strength father just bless
[14:21] today keep us safe in Jesus name we pray
[14:23] amen
[14:25] part six journey of believers lations
[14:27] 3:16 says now eight to Abraham and his
[14:30] seed where the promises made he saith
[14:33] not and to seeds as of many so he's not
[14:35] talking about natural seed of the world
[14:39] he's talking about as of one seed and to
[14:42] thy seed which is Christ now where is
[14:45] Christ there's brother Dale saying this
[14:47] morning where's Christ Christ in you is
[14:49] the great mystery it was Christ in
[14:52] Martin Luther but Martin Luther couldn't
[14:54] see the revelation of the Son of Man
[14:56] that somebody could look him say your
[14:59] guardian human flesh that wasn't for
[15:00] that time that was for this time
[15:02] where we can look at each other and we
[15:04] can look even back in the church ages
[15:06] and see that it was God in human flesh
[15:08] but they had a revelation that was the
[15:11] Son of God that God the Spirit God come
[15:14] into them and made them Christians well
[15:16] we know that's for a fact now - but we
[15:18] go to a little bit higher level till we
[15:21] see that the body of Christ
[15:23] they were the body of Christ they
[15:24] believed they were a body of Christ but
[15:26] I think they also knew that they're
[15:28] looking forward to a headstone to a time
[15:31] when God would take over in a body of
[15:34] believers and make this thing get out
[15:36] and you know get us out of here so
[15:37] that's what we're looking for and this I
[15:39] say that the Covenant that was confirmed
[15:41] before God and Christ the law which was
[15:43] four hundred and thirty years after
[15:44] cannot dissin all that it shouldn't make
[15:47] the promise of none effect so it doesn't
[15:49] matter what comes on what goes the
[15:53] covenant god made is I will I'm going to
[15:58] do this and you are the bride of Jesus
[16:01] Christ and I am going to be with you and
[16:03] I'm gonna help you through this journey
[16:04] that's what he said to Abram because
[16:07] remember the promise we'll read it just
[16:08] a little while the promise was made
[16:10] under uncircumcision the problem when
[16:16] you started in your journey of
[16:18] justification if you truly were
[16:21] justified by God not by yourself then it
[16:25] was God doing the work who's gonna
[16:28] forgive you of your past sins no one but
[16:31] God Almighty can forgive you of your
[16:33] past sins right so it was God already
[16:36] making the promise when you're under
[16:39] uncircumcision which meant you were
[16:41] still out into the world doing the
[16:43] things of the world but God had already
[16:44] made a covenant amen same way with Abram
[16:48] for if the inheritance be by the law
[16:50] it's no more promise in other words do's
[16:52] and don'ts if you'll come if you'll do
[16:54] ten different things
[16:56] ten ten of my things then that's the
[16:58] promise that wasn't what the problem is
[16:59] he made to Abraham he said I will and
[17:02] you're gonna do it alright for if the
[17:05] inheritance be of the Lord there's no
[17:07] more promise but God gave it to Abraham
[17:09] by promise
[17:10] and according that look in Hebrews six
[17:12] verse 13 he says when God made that
[17:14] promise
[17:15] Abraham because he could swear by no
[17:17] greater swore by himself we didn't swear
[17:19] by the he swear by the he swore by
[17:23] itself he said in other words I will as
[17:25] we see in Genesis chapter 12 I will make
[17:27] thee a great nation I will bless thee I
[17:29] will bless them that bless thee I will
[17:31] show thee the land where you needed to
[17:34] go right saying surely blessing I will
[17:36] bless them multiplying I will multiply
[17:38] they so after that he had patiently
[17:40] endured in other words Abram had to
[17:43] become Abraham so there had to be a
[17:45] journey in there of 25 years to wait for
[17:49] that promise to be made they know but
[17:51] God gave it to Abraham by promise you
[17:54] can be seated in the Lord had his
[17:55] blessing so after he had patiently
[17:57] endured he obtained the promise what
[18:01] Abraham endured and he got Isaac all
[18:08] right so let's go really quick no let's
[18:10] read number one call the one I want to
[18:12] finally get to Melchizedek because
[18:14] that's what brother Dale was talking
[18:15] about that
[18:16] Abraham finally met he had heard God he
[18:21] had seen God do things he had seen
[18:23] lights he had seen all these different
[18:26] things but he's going to finally meet
[18:29] God face to face so brother Brown tells
[18:33] us right here when Abraham met him he
[18:36] was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all
[18:39] the attributes that's us will do in the
[18:42] final in every son of Abraham what son
[18:45] of the faith every son of the faith will
[18:49] absolutely do the same thing so whatever
[18:52] that journey of Abram to Abraham and
[18:55] meeting God in human flesh you're gonna
[18:58] have to do the same thing you're gonna
[19:01] have to pattern yourself right after
[19:03] this we've tried to know four four five
[19:05] services to try to get that to you where
[19:07] we see that Abraham's journey is exactly
[19:11] the journey you got to go through
[19:13] exactly the journey that you got to go
[19:17] through you've got to go through
[19:18] justification you've got to go through
[19:20] sanctification then you've got to go
[19:21] through the baptism the Holy Ghost now
[19:23] some some go sooner some go later some
[19:27] takes a long time
[19:29] but it doesn't matter those who he is
[19:32] justified he has already glorified and
[19:34] he did not put a date in the time in
[19:36] between all that same way with you and I
[19:38] he didn't do that so I you say well
[19:41] sometimes you think maybe God's not not
[19:44] on the scene he listened before the
[19:47] foundation of the world he knew how long
[19:49] it would take you to go to each one of
[19:50] these so he's not gonna sit there and go
[19:55] no he's right there with you the whole
[19:57] time so he knows what day you're gonna
[20:00] receive the new birth he knows what day
[20:01] you're gonna come to this it's not a
[20:03] secret to him and it's really not a
[20:06] secret but if we believe what he's
[20:08] already wrote in the Bible told us the
[20:10] promise he give to Abram because I
[20:13] believe Abram being the father of our
[20:15] faith or Abraham the journey of Abram to
[20:19] Abraham is like I said it's our journey
[20:22] and if we we are what we're believers
[20:24] Abram begin his journey as a believer
[20:28] he's right there in the error of
[20:29] Chaldees he's got a real good job he's
[20:31] he's making good money he's right there
[20:33] with us daddy he's doing good he
[20:36] probably lives right there next door to
[20:38] his job and everything's going well and
[20:40] all of a sudden abram walks in and tells
[20:42] sarah which is a little contentious you
[20:44] know member sarah means contentious so
[20:47] he walks in he says Sarah we're leaving
[20:49] oh why we we run out of idols or what
[20:55] you know she I'm sure she questions as a
[20:56] human being but Abram believed what God
[21:01] said it and like I said before he could
[21:05] have he could have spoken to thousands
[21:07] of people but Abram is the only one that
[21:10] God knew would take this and take that
[21:13] journey all the way to the very end amen
[21:16] same way with with Mary there was many
[21:19] virgins probably at that time million
[21:21] more millions virgins than they are now
[21:23] but there was a virgin called Mary that
[21:26] that Gabriel came to and said how you're
[21:29] highly favored and she did question but
[21:31] she come to a point to where God you
[21:33] know other woman would say this be it
[21:37] unto me according to what you say all
[21:40] right so you have to come to that where
[21:41] we have
[21:42] to come to that I'll read to you in just
[21:44] a little while where brother brown tells
[21:46] us to receive the new birth is to have
[21:48] the faith of Abraham to believe that God
[21:52] can do it and then just believe that God
[21:55] can do it how simple is that so in
[21:58] Chapter 12 we see that's justification
[22:00] the total plan of redemption starting in
[22:02] Genesis chapter 12 and the Lord said
[22:05] unto Abram don't put this up just well
[22:07] I'm just gonna run through it real quick
[22:08] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[22:11] kindred because remember when you start
[22:13] your journey you must separate from what
[22:16] you were with you must if you don't
[22:19] separate from what you with you how
[22:23] Ewing world is going if he forgives you
[22:26] of all this past and then you keep
[22:29] walking with the same people for years
[22:31] after no you got to come out because
[22:34] Redemption is what coming out and going
[22:36] in the Bible says come out of her my
[22:38] people well you can say well that means
[22:40] us come out denominations no it means
[22:42] number one you got come out of the world
[22:44] first you got to get the world out of
[22:47] you first before you can get the
[22:49] denomination out of you go into Christ
[22:51] amen
[22:53] so now justification we see that God
[22:58] says and I will make of thee a great
[23:01] nation
[23:01] now remember this is Abram didn't have
[23:03] no kids he was thought he was still he
[23:04] was 70 something years old when he was
[23:06] right here and I will bless thee and
[23:09] make thy name great Abram probably he
[23:13] probably said thank many people know who
[23:16] I am what do you mean right I mean here
[23:20] he just appears it's kinda like Eli J
[23:22] lied you just appears in the Book of
[23:24] Kings Elijah the Tishbite nothing no
[23:26] like brother Branham said there's no
[23:28] history and the logic coming up as a
[23:30] young child off
[23:31] it just says Elijah's here and same way
[23:33] with a Abram Abram here in Genesis 12
[23:36] after the flood I know I've been talked
[23:39] about all of a sudden Abram name pops up
[23:43] why because he did what God said and God
[23:46] knew he wouldn't just be what we always
[23:49] called a flash in the pan you know what
[23:51] that means that means just I mean you
[23:53] know you see like brother Dale says a
[23:55] lot of people come in here
[23:56] and not so much now but a long time ago
[23:58] a lot of people would come in and be
[24:00] like a house on the fire on a windy day
[24:01] and burn a candle at both ends well you
[24:03] know you burn a candle at both ends all
[24:05] of a sudden you get to the middle and
[24:06] they all run out so that's the way a lot
[24:08] of people are Abram was not that way but
[24:10] now remember Abram just didn't get up
[24:12] and say okay all right we're gonna take
[24:14] hagar sara i me and you're gonna and I'm
[24:16] gonna take him we're gonna go to him we
[24:17] two years we're done that's not the
[24:21] journey of a Christian right I like what
[24:25] Dave Ramsey said it's not a this is not
[24:27] a microwave religion this is a crock pot
[24:30] religion it's gonna take some time it's
[24:34] gonna take some time to get through this
[24:36] journey it took Abram 25 years to get
[24:39] the actual promise that God gave him
[24:41] right here in Genesis 12 but he had to
[24:43] have a journey but you know what a
[24:44] journey is that's the testimony because
[24:46] the testimony starts with four first
[24:48] four letters or te s T you got to go to
[24:51] a test to have a testimony all right
[24:53] amen so then you look in Genesis 12 13
[24:57] and 14 you can just keep on going
[25:02] through that s okay cuz I'm not gonna
[25:03] read it all I got it I got to get to
[25:04] this end part then you see that Abram
[25:08] brings a lot with him something God did
[25:10] but you know what you're you're in your
[25:12] journey and you know what God knew Abram
[25:13] was gonna take lot he and he knows
[25:17] you're gonna take a lot with you you're
[25:19] gonna take a lot with you you're gonna
[25:21] carry a lot and it but now he's got to
[25:23] come to a day though somewhere when you
[25:25] continue in your journey that Lots got
[25:27] to go somewhere else you got to get rid
[25:30] of a lot all right so you get rid of a
[25:32] lot in your journey and you come up to a
[25:34] place we see justification coming until
[25:37] chapter 15 and in chapter 13 it's when
[25:43] they separate so you're gonna have to
[25:45] separate somewhere in your journey like
[25:48] I said you got to separate from the
[25:49] things you used to do all right because
[25:52] you're walking and you're walking with a
[25:54] purpose now that if God's justified you
[25:57] he's gonna glorify you so you got a
[25:59] you've got what a pull that's pulling
[26:02] you to that through gives me pulling you
[26:05] through that journey he's pulling you to
[26:08] a place
[26:09] that's that what he knows where you
[26:11] gonna get to but you don't same way with
[26:14] Abram Abram gets up first thing happens
[26:16] he gets into a little situation just
[26:18] like something what happened in your
[26:19] journey first thing comes up and here's
[26:20] Abram there's a famine in the land and I
[26:23] always told you what a family would do a
[26:24] famine makes you make a decision you got
[26:26] to decide where you gonna go you can't
[26:29] stay in a famine unless he should have
[26:31] listened to what God told him to do and
[26:33] stay but in other words he moved but now
[26:35] that would've been a lot that would have
[26:36] been Abram journey that would have been
[26:38] God's journey so you've got a journey
[26:40] it's your journey that you take so he
[26:43] knows you're going to go down into Egypt
[26:45] or go back into the world maybe and do
[26:47] some things of the world but what
[26:48] happened is as Abram terms right around
[26:51] and comes right back to Canaan where he
[26:53] had built an altar and and what do you
[26:56] do when you build an altar you make a
[26:58] commitment all in our journey we go and
[27:02] we make a commitment like when the
[27:05] children of Israel crossed the Red Sea
[27:06] what happened they put those 12 stones
[27:08] what to build a memorial that every time
[27:11] they walk by that that those twelve
[27:14] stones reminded them if they come out of
[27:16] Egypt and went across the Jordan and
[27:18] here's those twelve stones what it's a
[27:21] reminder same thing with you and I these
[27:23] are little reminders that you look back
[27:25] and and I have during this time here of
[27:28] doing this journey that you look back in
[27:32] your journeying and please don't ever
[27:34] think that and we all do as humans we go
[27:36] what we should have changed this or we
[27:38] should have done this different or you
[27:40] can't say that you can say that humanly
[27:42] but that wouldn't be your journey the
[27:46] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[27:48] of the Lord and a ladies a lot of things
[27:49] you did that wasn't of the Lord but he
[27:50] knew you had to go through them so that
[27:53] you can have a test so that you can have
[27:55] a testimony drugs never wasn't my
[27:58] problem the only drug I ever got got
[28:00] drug to church yeah that was the only
[28:06] drug problem I had but some others man
[28:09] had a drug problem and you know what
[28:10] that's okay
[28:11] I said had as long as we say had it's
[28:15] okay we had these other problems because
[28:18] we had lot we had brought lot with us
[28:22] but now
[28:22] it's kind of certain time to where you
[28:24] gotta weigh that down or God's gonna
[28:25] have to get it rid of it for you like
[28:27] brother Tom publish would always say God
[28:30] take the need and the desire because you
[28:33] ought we all have a desire to fill it
[28:35] with something so we're gonna fill it
[28:37] with sin until we become a Christian
[28:39] then then we're gonna start filling it
[28:41] with God but until we become a Christian
[28:43] that's the desire is to be is to fill up
[28:47] with something so you fill up with drugs
[28:48] or alcohol or whatever you want to you
[28:50] know put put that in you leave it blank
[28:52] you put it in your journey are the
[28:55] things that told I have things that
[28:56] doesn't bother me that that bother Luis
[28:59] Luis has some things that and don't ever
[29:02] laugh and say oh that's just trivial no
[29:03] it's something you got to go through
[29:07] each and every one of them has to go
[29:09] through a journey and you say well
[29:10] that's silly it's not silly when you're
[29:13] going through it
[29:14] hey man it's not silly it wasn't silly
[29:17] to Abram when he was going through some
[29:18] of these situations he was going through
[29:20] no it was his journey but what did God
[29:22] say God said you were going to be the
[29:26] father of the faith of all faithful so
[29:30] all your journey that he didn't tell him
[29:32] that exactly but he laid it in the plan
[29:35] he laid it in that plan before the
[29:38] foundation the world that we're going to
[29:40] be talking about Abraham and and you
[29:42] know what brother John we're gonna get
[29:44] to meet that guy we're gonna get to meet
[29:47] that physical man called Abraham and
[29:51] we're not going to go you big dummy no
[29:55] we're gonna say thank you for going
[29:57] through this journey and that God
[29:59] thought enough for you to write it in
[30:01] the Bible and put your name in there and
[30:05] then you bar the father of the faithful
[30:09] we are sons of Abraham that's what
[30:11] brother Brent said every son of the
[30:14] faith will go through this journey every
[30:17] son of Abraham now listen we're a son of
[30:21] God by birth but we're a son of Abraham
[30:24] by faith because you got to have faith
[30:26] in that person you got faith in
[30:28] something you can't see Abram had faith
[30:30] in something he could not see but he
[30:35] believed
[30:36] so much as brother branham's tells us
[30:38] many times to where he tells Sara hey
[30:40] get to you know get to get the pampers
[30:43] ready and get to get the bibs ready and
[30:45] get and Sara's going or Sara contentious
[30:49] sara sara she's going we ain't been
[30:53] husband and wife in for 25 years what
[30:55] are you talking about he said just get
[30:58] it ready just get it ready cuz I'm
[31:00] trusting and what God's told me right
[31:03] all right so that's so in justification
[31:05] we see that we're justified let's go to
[31:08] Roman's 3 verse 24 being justified
[31:12] freely by His grace through the
[31:13] redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[31:15] because remember he's the only just one
[31:20] you and I are not just at all but we
[31:23] take his justification to being
[31:26] justified freely by His grace through
[31:28] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[31:30] that starts our journey whom God has set
[31:33] forth to a perpetuation through faith in
[31:35] his blood to declare his righteousness
[31:37] not ours
[31:39] for the remission of sins that are past
[31:41] in other words remember we we can't get
[31:44] forgiven or something we do two weeks
[31:46] from now that's Catholicism no grace is
[31:49] for what happened yesterday all right
[31:52] we're having faith for tomorrow but
[31:55] we're getting grace for what was
[31:56] yesterday because right here remission
[31:59] of sins that are past showing that
[32:00] justification gets rid of our past sins
[32:03] through the forbearance of God see that
[32:05] forbearance what is that we have
[32:08] forbearance with our children when they
[32:09] can't walk you don't want to take
[32:13] Elliott at two months old and expect her
[32:16] to run a marathon why cuz we forbear we
[32:19] know that in the development of a child
[32:21] is going to be 11 months old 12 months
[32:24] old she's getting closer she's over that
[32:26] now let months walking a little bit now
[32:30] see but now Danny wasn't behind her 2
[32:32] months going hard if you don't if you
[32:34] don't walk up no he has forbearance I
[32:37] don't think he and I were gonna do that
[32:39] in any way but before but Danny had a
[32:42] little grim look on his face there like
[32:44] I can do that or not anyway that's why
[32:47] their grandchildren that's why God know
[32:49] how grant you
[32:50] because God could do that but God's not
[32:52] gonna do it at two months so what am I
[32:53] saying in your start of your journey
[32:55] your tender you're a young child and
[32:59] God's not gonna ever hurt your feelings
[33:01] so he's going to forbear and wait on you
[33:05] to come to a place and then when you do
[33:06] come to place though he's gonna finally
[33:08] look at you at 20 years old 20 and say
[33:12] you need to start walking and then he
[33:16] might give you a little stimulation from
[33:19] the backside to get you going but he
[33:22] forbears with each of us listen Gus
[33:26] never angry at us he knows what we're
[33:29] gonna do
[33:29] he knows what we're gonna do you sell on
[33:32] to God yeah God was angry with the
[33:33] children of Israel different place
[33:35] different ones but how can God be angry
[33:37] when he knows the end the reason we're
[33:40] angry with our kids isn't worth telling
[33:42] why you idiot what are you doing what
[33:43] you're doing it's because we don't know
[33:46] what the end results is gonna be y'all
[33:49] quit throwing it to the back there's
[33:50] nobody behind you but we don't know we
[33:54] don't know that journey but God does so
[33:58] he forebears the forbearance of God or
[34:01] what grace there's the grace of God we
[34:04] don't have a lot but God's got plenty of
[34:06] it for all of us all right to declare I
[34:09] say at this time his righteousness that
[34:11] he might be just and the justifier of
[34:15] him which believeth in Jesus so any all
[34:19] that journey of of Abram when he first
[34:21] got started God's not condemning him
[34:25] like the children of Israel they were
[34:27] say sin ten times but I was reading the
[34:30] other day and Exodus where they would
[34:32] goof up and and and and have all kinds
[34:35] of mistakes and God would come right
[34:37] back next ahead of the next chapter he
[34:39] said when you get in when you get in the
[34:42] Promised Land
[34:43] this is what I want you to do if it had
[34:45] been us we'd be going y'all ain't going
[34:48] yeah for what you just did y'all ain't
[34:50] going and God knew there was only two of
[34:53] that group was gonna go but he forbear
[34:56] with them trying to what give him a
[34:58] chance but he knew that Josh when Caleb
[35:01] was the only two that was going to go
[35:02] out of that group
[35:03] but still he kept going when you get in
[35:05] the promised land this is what I want
[35:06] you to do and they go are we load this
[35:09] bread we hate this stuff we have no
[35:11] water to drink they're always
[35:12] complaining but God just kept right on
[35:14] going that's the same way with Abram God
[35:18] didn't complain to Abram when he tried
[35:20] to give his wife away but he did come to
[35:25] a place to where he protected his
[35:27] promise and and he'll do the same with
[35:30] you you'll wonder a lot of things that
[35:31] happen in your in your early journey in
[35:33] your Christian life you wonder how these
[35:35] things happen and like we did me and
[35:37] brothers I thought you know God's nose
[35:39] was the best yes is if you get a no from
[35:41] God that's the best yes you ever got
[35:43] because he knows if he said if he allows
[35:45] you to continue on down this truck
[35:47] direction he knows how you gonna end up
[35:49] so he says no don't go that way you need
[35:52] to go in another direction same way with
[35:55] Abram Abram you needed this is the way
[35:57] you need to go you don't need to be
[35:58] going in that direction you need to go
[36:00] over this way all right so that's that's
[36:02] the guidance of God is what I that's
[36:04] what I want you to understand the
[36:06] guidance of God he always as sister
[36:10] Gayle says God's arm is long and it is
[36:13] he's got a long arm because he's got a
[36:15] lot of Grace and you know remember there
[36:17] nail-scarred hands to that he leads us
[36:20] in God's a spy so even in our
[36:23] justification we see that Abram was
[36:25] right in the will of God all the time
[36:28] doesn't matter where he went because
[36:30] remember he meets Melchizedek after a
[36:33] certain victory he meets Melchizedek but
[36:36] you know really I don't thinking I'm
[36:39] saying this for my own even in my
[36:40] journey that that he met Melchizedek but
[36:44] I don't think he fully understood who
[36:45] the guy was
[36:47] because remember here Melchizedek in
[36:49] verse 18 Mel because that king of Salem
[36:51] brought forth bread and wine because you
[36:54] got to remember one thing he said
[36:56] blessed Abram of the Most High God
[36:58] possessor of heaven and earth and Abram
[37:00] gave him tithes but you got to remember
[37:02] when we get over here into chapter 18 he
[37:05] addresses that person as my Lord you see
[37:10] what I mean about in your journey you
[37:11] mate sometimes you may not know what's
[37:13] God dealing with you you said well no
[37:15] sometimes you may not
[37:16] but when you come to the new birth in
[37:18] when you have to meet God in human flesh
[37:20] you know that position so Abram didn't
[37:25] know in the in his position of walking
[37:26] in justification he met God in human
[37:29] flesh but he didn't realize exactly who
[37:31] he was because he didn't say my lord he
[37:34] actually didn't say anything he just
[37:35] gave him ties you understand what I mean
[37:37] but so God's gonna meet you but now I
[37:39] believe if I believe this is what I
[37:41] believe when Abram was changed to
[37:43] Abraham and he meant Melchizedek it was
[37:47] the same guy he met back in
[37:48] justification he hadn't changed his form
[37:50] he was still Melchizedek and I believe
[37:53] Abraham that's how excited I believe
[37:55] Abraham got when he said I met you 25
[37:59] years same guys been through this whole
[38:03] journey I met you 25 years ago I just
[38:05] didn't realize it my lord
[38:08] because remember brother Graham said
[38:10] that's interpreted and Lord God l owe
[38:12] him that that was Almighty God standing
[38:14] there
[38:14] well that was Almighty God back in
[38:16] chapter 14 but same way with me and you
[38:20] you meet people in your journey and you
[38:22] do things in your journey and you say
[38:23] well you know that maybe God or I just
[38:26] got lucky or all these things and then
[38:27] when you get born again though and you
[38:29] look back and you say that was you Lord
[38:32] that was you that did that it wasn't me
[38:36] it was you I don't I'm for one I don't
[38:38] believe in luck I believe in dumb luck
[38:45] because we make it but I don't believe
[38:47] that you get lucky and become a
[38:49] Christian ha I don't believe that I
[38:51] believe God's got this thing and I know
[38:53] he's got it all settled out where it
[38:56] needs to go and we just get into the
[38:58] plan so let's read Ezekiel 11 verse 17
[39:02] let's see what this as we're going
[39:05] through our journey we look back in
[39:07] Ezekiel because look now remember Abram
[39:09] didn't have no book Abram had no Bible
[39:14] Abram had no he had nothing to go on
[39:18] except the voice of a man but we can
[39:22] look back and even a zekiel could look
[39:25] back to Abraham but as we look back to
[39:28] Ezekiel we see
[39:30] Ezekiel is is picking up exactly what
[39:32] Abram went through therefore say thus
[39:35] saith the Lord God I will even gather
[39:37] you from your people what do you do with
[39:40] Abraham he gathered him from the people
[39:43] and assembled you out of the countries
[39:46] that you've been scattered in in other
[39:48] words Abram went to all these different
[39:50] countries you went to all these
[39:53] different things that you did just put
[39:56] you know you you you put it in the blank
[39:58] things you did now look and I will give
[40:01] you the Land of Israel so there's a land
[40:03] you coming to what do you tell Abram he
[40:05] said wherever you walk wherever the sole
[40:07] of your feet is that's what I'm gonna
[40:09] give as a possession all right and they
[40:12] shall come thither and they shall take
[40:14] away all the detestable things thereof
[40:16] Abram got rid of lot got rid of all
[40:19] these different things had a name change
[40:21] and all the abominations thereof from
[40:25] this what you're doing during your
[40:26] journey what's he doing he's kicking out
[40:29] all the all the junk just like in the
[40:32] statue a perfect man even when you
[40:33] getting a statue a perfect man you got
[40:35] junk that God's gonna do the same thing
[40:37] I believe that I just believe that
[40:43] justification for those of you that is
[40:45] not part of the church if you're
[40:46] watching in justification has three
[40:48] parts
[40:49] sanctification has three parts and the
[40:51] baptism of Holy Ghost has three parts
[40:53] it's the same it's the same work but
[40:55] when you get justified and you get your
[40:57] past sins chopped off you got to start
[41:01] realizing that God did it that work you
[41:04] can't do it and that you come to a part
[41:06] of justification that the real you
[41:08] didn't do it this God did it but the guy
[41:11] inside you did not do that so you come
[41:14] to a higher realization of what God
[41:16] wanted you to do because remember God's
[41:22] forbearance his forbearance knows that
[41:26] we need it because he's not gonna dump
[41:29] it all on us at one time he didn't dump
[41:30] everything on brother branham he brought
[41:33] him right up to the journey just like he
[41:34] brought Abram to Abraham he brought all
[41:36] the he brought everyone because man if
[41:38] he throwed everything on top of you he
[41:40] knows we're human
[41:43] and I will give them one heart and I
[41:46] will put a new spirit within you and
[41:48] we'll get to that in a second and I will
[41:50] take the Stoney heart out of your flesh
[41:52] and we'll give them a heart of flesh
[41:53] what we're talking about a Stoney heart
[41:55] you God can't use a stony heart because
[41:57] it's set you know the old saying set in
[41:59] stone that's why it's set in stone now
[42:02] when we come to Revelation that set in
[42:06] stone but you have to start with a
[42:08] fleshly heart where God can use you and
[42:11] mold you as the Potter in justification
[42:15] see so he doesn't dump it all on you
[42:17] you got a tender heart when you first
[42:19] start your journey then you come a
[42:20] little bit further up to where you know
[42:22] God's right there with you like with you
[42:24] know everybody's sheltering little Elli
[42:25] and sheltering these babies and and
[42:27] trying to do what we're trying to mold
[42:29] them trying to get them going in the
[42:31] right direction okay but like you know
[42:34] Danny's not gonna give the car keys to
[42:36] her maybe the play with but not to get
[42:38] in the car and drive the truck right
[42:41] that's right not at the moment but when
[42:44] she gets 45 she'll be able to drive
[42:48] somebody's vehicle you see what I mean
[42:51] though that's what God is doing the same
[42:52] thing we have the potential to get the
[42:55] key to drive the car but God's not gonna
[42:57] give us the key when we're in
[42:58] justification he's not gonna give us the
[43:00] key we're in sanctification he's going
[43:02] to give us the key when we're at the
[43:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost he stones
[43:05] start revealing things to us that what
[43:08] we're gonna do is it's gonna build that
[43:10] stature not a statue a stature of a
[43:14] perfect man everybody got that say ma'am
[43:16] all right so let's go to chapter 15 so
[43:20] justification is picking you up and the
[43:24] bottle is still dirty but God has a
[43:27] purpose you don't know it yet but God
[43:30] does so he picks you up out of the world
[43:32] and you still got mud dripping here and
[43:35] you definitely got mud inside all right
[43:38] but now God is getting ready he's gonna
[43:40] mold that thing to where he can put
[43:42] clean water in there and drink it but
[43:44] not at that moment of justification so
[43:48] Abraham's not going to have the promise
[43:49] baby because it's really not promise to
[43:53] Abram it's promise to Abraham but Abram
[43:56] to know
[43:57] yet right you just a lot of thing like I
[44:00] said before I want us to see everybody
[44:02] that's in the new journey even all of us
[44:04] it's maybe in a new journey going up the
[44:06] Statue of a perfect man we must realize
[44:08] the same thing listen God's not gonna
[44:11] he's not a respecter of persons he's not
[44:13] gonna he always he has to go by your
[44:16] desires
[44:18] remember what brother Brown said brother
[44:20] Brown said God you have a desire God
[44:23] goes by the desires that you have all
[44:26] right that's the free will he gives us
[44:28] to do it or not do it alright so in
[44:31] sanctification we see though that God is
[44:33] gonna clean this up and empty it out of
[44:37] the junk but he's not gonna put it in
[44:40] service because it's not ready yet
[44:42] Abram was not ready to have the promised
[44:45] son because he was an Abraham God didn't
[44:48] tell him that Sarah
[44:50] he didn't tell him I mean you know he
[44:51] comes in with Hagar and he makes another
[44:53] mistake and and he goes in the
[44:55] permissive will of God and sometimes we
[44:57] do the same thing a lot of times we do
[45:00] the same thing but in chapter 15 the
[45:03] Bible says after these things the word
[45:05] of the Lord came to Abram in a vision so
[45:08] God is getting closer he's using now
[45:10] more says fear not Abram I am thy shield
[45:13] and my exceeding great reward and
[45:16] Abraham's Abraham's just like you and I
[45:21] even in our journey we cry for the new
[45:24] birth Amen you cry Lord when you
[45:28] starting this journey especially being
[45:30] in the I say the message say that
[45:33] loosely but being in the belief that we
[45:35] have that it takes the three processes
[45:36] you should know that people out in the
[45:39] world don't have that they just think
[45:41] come up shake a hand I don't I don't do
[45:43] this anymore I'm gonna start coming to
[45:45] church but I got all these little things
[45:46] that I'm still doing I'm not perfect
[45:48] you're not perfect how many times you
[45:49] heard that you start talking to people
[45:51] and you start talking about Haran you
[45:53] know get into the doctrinal issues and
[45:55] well you're not perfect neither am i you
[45:57] know you know what they're saying
[45:58] they're saying I can go ahead and smoke
[46:00] and do the things I do because I'm not
[46:02] perfect and that's not really them
[46:05] saying that that's the person inside cuz
[46:07] they ain't got the right person inside
[46:09] the right person inside
[46:11] kicks all that out like the unclean
[46:12] spirit and sanctification the unclean
[46:14] spirit goes out Abram says Lord what
[46:17] will they give me seeing I go childless
[46:18] now Abram remembers in his Christian
[46:21] journey that God had promised him ever
[46:24] how many years back that he was going to
[46:26] have a son and Abram and and like
[46:30] brother Brian said I love what brother
[46:31] Brian said he said God does not mind you
[46:33] reminding him of what he said okay God
[46:37] don't mind you reminding or quoting
[46:39] scripture back to him so Abram is
[46:41] quoting scripture back to God and says
[46:44] the Lord hello child me and Sarah Sarah
[46:51] have not had kids for ever how many
[46:54] years we've been married
[46:56] seeing I go childless and he keeps going
[46:58] through and he kind of wants to put a
[46:59] substitute in and sometimes we do that
[47:01] in our Christian journey us thing about
[47:03] this other day sometimes we want to put
[47:05] a substitute in we think this is the way
[47:08] it needs to be and that I'm going to go
[47:10] ahead and if I don't you know I think I
[47:12] got the new birth
[47:13] like I said sanctification is really
[47:15] hard because Satan comes and brings
[47:17] religious demons to you and he tries to
[47:20] get you to think well I'll just I'll
[47:22] just sit in the message church and as
[47:25] long as I come every once in awhile they
[47:27] won't miss me and and but I'm still
[47:30] secretly do what I've been doing before
[47:32] right secretly because you feel ashamed
[47:37] but then what does God do he if you're a
[47:39] real true child of God and you're in
[47:41] that journey he goes hey get back in get
[47:46] back in the promise this is your promise
[47:48] over here not that promise that you had
[47:50] out there alright so we see in st. if
[47:54] occation after these things the word of
[47:55] the Lord came to Abram and Abram said
[47:57] Lord God and then verse forces and
[48:01] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[48:03] him saying this shall not be thine heir
[48:06] God's telling him go go that way same
[48:11] ways that don't go that way Abram I got
[48:13] a promise for you believing the promise
[48:15] you say well that looks like Abraham
[48:18] didn't believe listen there's a lot of
[48:19] times than that we look and see it looks
[48:21] like Abram didn't believe but deep down
[48:23] inside
[48:24] something was pulling Abram toward that
[48:27] promise or he wouldn't be the father
[48:29] face the same way with you and I look at
[48:31] all the circumstances that we produce
[48:32] and we go why I don't think this and I
[48:34] don't think that but then you see that
[48:35] somebody like brothers I can and me
[48:37] being gone for 20 years and you see
[48:40] something pulling you and then you see
[48:42] the end result that you you're still
[48:46] doing stupid stuff but yet God's still
[48:51] pulling it and you know why it's God
[48:54] pulling you because you know what Satan
[48:55] will never give you the new birth Saint
[48:58] or never saying you're my child cuz he
[49:01] because you're already here's right here
[49:03] but God is saying come on you're my
[49:05] child come on come on
[49:07] fall down that's okay don't worry Ellie
[49:10] you gonna fall down I'll pick you back
[49:12] up and come on come on he's pulling you
[49:15] toward him same way with Abram even
[49:18] unconsciously something was pulling
[49:21] Abram toward this goal that God had for
[49:24] him because God said I will and I've
[49:28] attached myself to Abram now not the way
[49:33] even a hidden out when he attaches
[49:34] itself to us brothers and sisters we
[49:36] become born-again Christians when he
[49:38] really attaches itself to us we become
[49:41] born again he couldn't do that with
[49:43] Abram but he was pulling him to show
[49:45] what to show us here now in 2020 we're
[49:48] talking about this journey of this man
[49:49] called Abram and how that you're going I
[49:53] remembered that happened he's actually
[49:55] the same thing to me that and that
[49:57] exactly happened to me and this is
[49:58] exactly what happened to me and I see
[50:01] how God done this and pulled me here and
[50:03] I wondered why I did that and there's
[50:06] your example he gave you one two three
[50:09] thousand years ago I mean you know this
[50:13] is BC 1913 so that's almost four
[50:16] thousand years he gave us an example of
[50:19] a man that walked right through the
[50:24] journey like you and I are going through
[50:25] so he's getting ready to go through
[50:26] sanctification which is what cleaned and
[50:29] set aside for service not put in service
[50:31] but you got it he's got to clean you up
[50:32] first and remember he told him he said
[50:36] look toward the Stars and
[50:38] if you number them so shall thy seed
[50:39] blade be and look and he believed in the
[50:43] Lord and he God counted it to him Abram
[50:48] for righteousness everybody got that and
[50:52] he said unto him I am the Lord that
[50:55] brought thee out of ur what was he doing
[50:57] he was identifying somewhere in your
[51:00] journey God is gonna identify and say
[51:02] look you're talking to me I'm the one
[51:06] that did this you're talking to me I'm
[51:08] talking to you it's a personal thing
[51:11] when you come in to specially in
[51:12] sanctification when the unclean spirit
[51:14] goes out because you know what God won't
[51:16] dwell in an unclean vessel but now that
[51:19] he's cleans you up like we're gonna talk
[51:20] about in a minute he's going to give you
[51:22] a new spirit - what he's gonna give you
[51:26] a new spirit not the Holy Spirit he's
[51:28] gonna give you a new spirit so that you
[51:30] can coincide with what he's fixing to
[51:32] bring you because what he's bringing you
[51:34] is holy what went out of you is not he's
[51:38] not gonna take something holy out of you
[51:40] and put something holy in he's gonna
[51:42] take the unclean spirit out and then
[51:44] he's gonna put his spirit in after he
[51:47] gives you a new spirit in sanctification
[51:50] that's what we're gonna read right here
[51:52] let's go to Hebrews 2 because we'll get
[51:57] to that back in just a second Hebrews -
[51:59] thank you brother Anderson he's doing
[52:01] double-duty I think brother Richards
[52:03] back there helping him thank you brother
[52:05] Joe's at home resting a little bit he
[52:07] brother Joe's got a lot of hats to
[52:09] fulfil so we let him rest a little bit
[52:12] he's also getting older so is his wife
[52:14] so anyway Hebrews 2 verse 11 for both
[52:17] either sanctify and they who are
[52:19] sanctified are all of one he didn't say
[52:21] that in justification does everybody
[52:24] understand in justification we know
[52:25] God's right there but he can't touch you
[52:27] because he can't dwell in an unclean
[52:29] vessel but he can guide you but when you
[52:32] come to sanctification he's getting like
[52:33] this see because then when you get born
[52:36] again he's like this that's we see Abram
[52:42] Abram God's talking to him I just kind
[52:45] of doing this but all of a sudden for
[52:49] both he that sanctifies and daily
[52:51] sanctified
[52:51] all of one coming closer coming closer
[52:56] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[52:58] call them brethren even brother Brown
[52:59] tells us that sanctification you come
[53:01] under a religious order you start coming
[53:03] to church you start calling brethren
[53:06] brothers god bless you brother you know
[53:09] why cause you mean it when I used to
[53:11] come on Eastern Sunday I didn't mean it
[53:13] when I shook their hand
[53:14] I never said brother because they
[53:15] weren't they weren't my brother my
[53:20] brothers was the ones I left out there
[53:22] in the world that brothers they helped
[53:23] me do all the things it in Rome right
[53:27] but when you come in here he's not
[53:31] ashamed to call you brethren saying I
[53:33] will declare thy name unto my brethren
[53:35] in the midst of the church will I sing
[53:37] praises unto thee Ezekiel 36 verse 25
[53:41] for I will take you from among the
[53:43] heathen now here's the same thing he's
[53:45] taking us he's separating Abram and
[53:48] gather you out of all countries and
[53:50] we'll bring you into your own land
[53:53] what is your promised land the baptism
[53:55] of the Holy Ghost listen we have no land
[53:58] grant Israel does we don't this whole
[54:04] world is ours but it's not promised that
[54:08] we get a certain spot he told Abram you
[54:10] get a certain spot whatever wherever you
[54:12] walk that's where you're gonna get
[54:14] that's why the new cities gonna be over
[54:16] there not in the United States
[54:18] Abram didn't walk in the United States
[54:19] he walked over there in Palestine in all
[54:21] those different places that's the land
[54:23] grant of the son of Abraham that they
[54:26] get the land that you and I don't get a
[54:27] land the land our promised land remember
[54:31] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now
[54:34] remember what does that give us
[54:36] that gives us heaven on earth it gives
[54:39] us a whole universe he gives us
[54:41] everything not just a little spot
[54:48] because you know what is that same God
[54:50] that said let there be his brother Dale
[54:52] was talking about this morning we got to
[54:54] connect back to that that's what we got
[54:57] to connect back to is that right there
[54:59] all right you love the Lord Ezekiel 36
[55:03] verse 25 Oh take you from among the
[55:05] heathen
[55:05] get Europe gather you out of all
[55:07] countries and will bring you into your
[55:09] own land then I will sprinkle clean
[55:12] water on you
[55:13] what washing of water by the word he's
[55:15] getting ready to wash Abram to make him
[55:18] Abraham
[55:18] all right everybody got that all right
[55:21] he's got to go through some things first
[55:25] then I will sprinkle clean water upon
[55:27] you and you shall be clean now
[55:30] clean but not in service yet cleaned and
[55:33] set aside for service okay because we
[55:37] got to get this thing filled up with
[55:38] something that wasn't in there before
[55:40] the Holy Ghost clean water he's cleaning
[55:44] you up he's cleaning you out but he's
[55:47] got to fill you with something
[55:48] cuz watch then I will sprinkle clean
[55:52] water upon you and you shall be clean
[55:54] from all your filthiness and all your
[55:57] idols the things we had idols before
[56:01] will I cleanse you a new heart also
[56:07] while I give you we know that that was
[56:08] in justification and a new spirit will I
[56:11] put within you and I will take away the
[56:14] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[56:16] give you a heart of flesh
[56:19] so here's Abram we're not going to go
[56:21] through the whole thing but we see that
[56:23] Abram he's doing sacrifices he's doing
[56:26] things here in Chapter 15 God shows him
[56:30] hell God shows him death God shows him
[56:33] all these things he said Abram you ain't
[56:36] got nothing to do with this you can't
[56:39] clean yourself up
[56:41] you can wash yourself with water all you
[56:44] won't do regular water but by the
[56:46] washing of the water of the word Abram
[56:48] I'm gonna wash you you're dead
[56:52] cuz you know you got died first before
[56:54] God can fill you up with something you
[56:56] got to die out to yourself in
[56:58] sanctification and that's where and I
[57:02] you know we've said for years that's
[57:05] where you have to be careful because you
[57:07] feel clean you feel good you feel
[57:10] religious you everybody's hugging your
[57:12] names they all brothers ain't good to
[57:14] see you back but then six months later
[57:19] all you see is is back going out the
[57:22] door no I'm not you understand but that
[57:26] did happen because you do go through
[57:29] things you go through abs and flows I
[57:31] did I thought maybe when I was 14 years
[57:33] old and the church was turned in this
[57:34] way that I'd given my heart to God I may
[57:36] have a good case of justification I
[57:38] don't know I well I know if one thing's
[57:40] for sure it didn't stick I know it did
[57:45] so I was probably just a little scared
[57:49] or justified myself because you know
[57:52] when you come to a place where God leads
[57:54] you to the very end of this thing like
[57:56] we're talking about then you know all of
[57:58] us know when you get born again then we
[58:01] know that God justified us and we know
[58:03] when he justified us right I wants to
[58:08] see that but don't stay in
[58:10] sanctification because sanctification is
[58:11] a real comfortable place to be the
[58:14] unclean spirit is going out everything
[58:15] feels good and everybody's like well I'm
[58:17] good to see you back man I just knew it
[58:19] was God this time how many times you've
[58:21] seen that then they go come in leave
[58:25] come in leave if he ever fills you with
[58:31] something you won't leave and I don't
[58:33] mean physically leave the building you
[58:35] won't leave you're walking God all right
[58:38] so now let's go to Genesis we're at
[58:41] Genesis 1516 we know what happened so
[58:43] let's read what brother Brown says in a
[58:45] hidden life in Christ how I'd like to
[58:48] stop here if it was possible and tell
[58:49] you something on that you're look
[58:51] created yourself he said he'd give you a
[58:53] new spirit now that spirit isn't God's
[58:56] Spirit I want to hammer this with this
[58:57] for three services I want to tell you
[58:59] he'll give you a new spirit now that
[59:02] isn't God's Spirit be careful that
[59:06] unclean spirit can come back that's what
[59:11] the Bible says in Luke says the unclean
[59:13] spirit goes out of men Wolf's and drive
[59:15] places seeks rest on this none cometh
[59:17] back to his house and bringing seven
[59:21] demons worse and the state of that
[59:24] person is worse than when it while he
[59:26] gives you Satan gives you a religious
[59:28] spirit but now that spirit isn't God's
[59:32] Spirit
[59:32] your spirit God gives you a new spirit
[59:35] then he says I'll then he says I'll put
[59:37] my spirit in him but the thing God has
[59:39] to do is give you a new spirit make your
[59:42] nature a little more gentle and settle
[59:45] down or he couldn't even live with you
[59:48] so he has to get you fixed up first
[59:51] before he can come in I'll give you a
[59:54] new spirit then he takes him anywhere
[59:57] you go all kinds of places he's got to
[59:59] get you fixed so you can what entertain
[1:00:02] him right remember the Holy Ghost is a
[1:00:04] timid person brother Brahm tells us how
[1:00:06] love I love brother when I'm telling us
[1:00:08] that because even now we can grieve the
[1:00:10] Holy Spirit because we know we do and we
[1:00:14] have to cry Lord forgive me I'm sorry
[1:00:16] and then he's that he doesn't it's just
[1:00:19] a it's a story it's not a the Holy Ghost
[1:00:23] doesn't physically go out and your trees
[1:00:25] in the yard and sit on a limb you know
[1:00:28] you don't physically do that but in
[1:00:32] metaphor or in telling a story he
[1:00:35] withdraws itself so you can call him
[1:00:39] back so he's not gonna go out for
[1:00:41] anybody that says well he's gonna go out
[1:00:43] on a limb and go I know he's just going
[1:00:45] to say hey that was wrong what you did
[1:00:50] and until you get that straightened down
[1:00:53] until you get that straightened out
[1:00:55] you're not going any further than this
[1:00:56] right here till you get that
[1:00:58] straightened out you're not going any
[1:00:59] further
[1:01:00] Abram if he hadn't got all the stuff
[1:01:02] straightened out in his life and asked
[1:01:04] God to forgive him and all these
[1:01:06] different things you say he didn't ask
[1:01:07] God to forgive him I believe he did cuz
[1:01:09] Abel did some really dumb stuff all
[1:01:12] right but you asked God to forgive you
[1:01:14] and then what's he gonna do he's gonna
[1:01:15] come back close and have that communion
[1:01:16] again all right
[1:01:18] everybody got that cuz you know brother
[1:01:19] Brown makes a quote hit that the Holy
[1:01:21] Ghost goes out on a limb and sits there
[1:01:22] and waits on you to call him back he's
[1:01:24] not gonna withdraw he is gonna withdraw
[1:01:26] itself but you'll know it you will know
[1:01:30] it how many times have we done that
[1:01:31] everybody everybody raised their hand in
[1:01:33] at home and everywhere else
[1:01:35] we've grieved the Holy Spirit but he's
[1:01:39] not gonna leave your forsake you because
[1:01:40] you know what a child that God will feel
[1:01:42] that and brothers like brother Graham
[1:01:44] said you'll feel checked
[1:01:45] you'll feel checked and what you do is
[1:01:48] say forgive me Lord and all of a sudden
[1:01:50] he just steps right back in and you
[1:01:51] continue right on in your journey
[1:01:53] alright and look that's not gonna make a
[1:01:56] big deal out of it you're his but he's
[1:02:01] gonna withdraw some things from you that
[1:02:03] you should have had more access to
[1:02:06] because we're still a free moral agent
[1:02:08] and I like what brother Brown said the
[1:02:10] Holy Ghost is a timid he's not somebody
[1:02:12] like like I've always said you know I if
[1:02:14] you let me in your house and you had
[1:02:16] doors locked I'd be knocking them doors
[1:02:17] down see what's behind it but brother
[1:02:19] branham said the Holy Ghost wouldn't do
[1:02:20] that he waits on you to open the door
[1:02:22] what's happened in Revelation chapter 3
[1:02:26] Jesus the very creator God is barred by
[1:02:32] a door why don't he just say open oh
[1:02:36] he's God does say open and the faint
[1:02:39] swings open
[1:02:40] doesn't matter if it's locked by a
[1:02:41] million locks but he's going can I come
[1:02:45] in
[1:02:45] because he's very timid the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] is and and and for what God gives us a
[1:02:51] new spirit to be able to what not drive
[1:02:54] that spirit out not drive what the Holy
[1:02:57] Spirit away from us because he wants to
[1:03:00] come and dwell in this vessel not own he
[1:03:03] wants to dwell in alright let's finish
[1:03:06] this quote let's go to the next one
[1:03:09] number three Intervale 1956 notice he
[1:03:14] put a new spirit God has to give you a
[1:03:16] new spirit or you couldn't even get
[1:03:18] along with him you can't get along with
[1:03:21] yourself that old devil spirit you had
[1:03:24] in you so he's got to put a new spirit
[1:03:27] in you so you can get along with his
[1:03:29] spirit amen
[1:03:30] I'll put a new spirit in them and I'll
[1:03:33] put my spirit in them he said after he
[1:03:35] gives you a new spirit that's you don't
[1:03:38] get it confused with God's Spirit it's
[1:03:40] not it's your new spirit so you can get
[1:03:43] along with the Holy Spirit if he ever
[1:03:45] gives it to you alright now let's go to
[1:03:50] Genesis chapter 17 that we talked about
[1:03:52] this last week where Genesis 17 we look
[1:03:57] at Ezekiel now what's going to happen
[1:03:59] now
[1:03:59] now we've come into the new birth we're
[1:04:01] coming to where Abram is not going to be
[1:04:03] Abram the center anymore he's gonna be
[1:04:05] Abraham the Christian we're gonna get a
[1:04:07] new name we're gonna get a name change
[1:04:09] God's gonna change our name to Christian
[1:04:12] you are potentially a Christian that
[1:04:15] sanctification potentially but you can
[1:04:17] still fall back and still be like like
[1:04:19] the the Bible says Satan unclean spirit
[1:04:22] goes out and he comes back to his house
[1:04:25] remember the Bible says the Bible says
[1:04:27] he's coming back - in other words he
[1:04:28] owns this house at the moment if you're
[1:04:32] born again he doesn't your God's but
[1:04:35] before you're born again even in
[1:04:37] sanctification he can bring seven
[1:04:39] spirits worse go back down inside this
[1:04:41] guy and he thinks he's got it but when
[1:04:46] you keep it cleaned out a member Abram
[1:04:48] during sanctification he kept all the
[1:04:51] fouls he kept all the birds from eating
[1:04:53] his from eating his sacrifice he kept
[1:04:57] all the fouls away all in foul spirits
[1:04:59] so you do how it is a fight to me and
[1:05:02] sanctification it's a real fight you're
[1:05:05] fighting with that old you that's still
[1:05:07] there and then that new you that wants
[1:05:11] to come in and you're right in that
[1:05:12] little place in between that's what it
[1:05:17] says but I remember it's which one you
[1:05:21] feed is which one is going to win a man
[1:05:26] but God knows join Genesis chapter 17
[1:05:31] real quick he comes back again and he
[1:05:34] tells us in Ezekiel 36 lot will stay
[1:05:36] right there when Abram was ninety years
[1:05:38] old and nine wow what a big what a big
[1:05:41] step the Lord appeared to Abram now it
[1:05:47] had to be in a vision or the Bible even
[1:05:49] says here theophany so he was he was not
[1:05:52] met by somebody in human flesh yet okay
[1:05:55] alright and the Lord appeared to Abram
[1:05:58] said unto him I am the Almighty God walk
[1:06:01] before me and be thou perfect he never
[1:06:03] said anything about being perfect until
[1:06:04] he comes to this spot alright and I will
[1:06:07] make my covenant between me and thee
[1:06:09] will multiply the exceedingly and
[1:06:11] Abraham you know he's four
[1:06:13] down his face he said neither verse five
[1:06:15] neither shall thy name be any more Abram
[1:06:17] but thou shalt be called Abraham for a
[1:06:19] father of many nations have I made thee
[1:06:23] he goes all the way back and tells Abram
[1:06:26] I started this thing way back under
[1:06:29] right that I have made that he didn't
[1:06:32] just become no he come to a revelation
[1:06:35] of how it's going to be done verse six
[1:06:38] and I will make the exceeding fruitful
[1:06:40] and I will make nations out of the Kings
[1:06:43] you'll come out of it and I will
[1:06:44] establish my covenant between me and
[1:06:46] thee and thy seed after thee in their
[1:06:47] generations for an everlasting covenant
[1:06:49] and to be a God unto thee and thy seed
[1:06:52] after and I will look at all those I
[1:06:54] will and I will give unto thee and to
[1:06:58] thy seed after the the land wherein thou
[1:07:00] art a stranger all the land of canaan
[1:07:02] for an everlasting possession verse ten
[1:07:05] this is my covenant which ye shall keep
[1:07:07] between me and you and thy seed after
[1:07:09] thee every man child among you shall be
[1:07:12] circumcised and we were talking about
[1:07:13] that last week the seal of circumcision
[1:07:16] cutting off the foreskin and remember
[1:07:20] like I said before and I don't want to
[1:07:21] be too graphic but it's a private affair
[1:07:23] with God is something God does in
[1:07:25] private it's in the private parts of
[1:07:28] your heart is where he it were he
[1:07:31] circumcised is but you know what happens
[1:07:33] you're able to show it if the world
[1:07:36] needs to know you're a Christian you're
[1:07:38] going to immediately well a lot of times
[1:07:40] immediately they're gonna frame you
[1:07:43] something you know you're gonna fit in
[1:07:45] somewhere you're gonna fit somewhere and
[1:07:48] they're gonna go that Bob black you know
[1:07:49] down that all them and I don't say this
[1:07:52] to be I don't say this to be mean to all
[1:07:56] the lawyers and everything but you know
[1:07:58] they're probably drinkers and smokers
[1:07:59] and gamblers and probably not Christian
[1:08:02] not all of them but here's by black and
[1:08:04] by black standing in the middle of all
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:06] I think Hall County has been triply
[1:08:12] blessed to have brother Louie's brother
[1:08:16] Joe and brother Richard all working in
[1:08:19] the same office now and then mr. Turpin
[1:08:23] is a Christian nominal Christian and
[1:08:25] even brother will Scofield is
[1:08:27] it's a normal Christian that's why they
[1:08:28] get a lot done that's why you say well
[1:08:30] you know God's gonna bless you do you
[1:08:35] have problems yeah but you might not
[1:08:38] have as many same with Bob but you know
[1:08:39] there's brother Bob and mm-hmm and they
[1:08:42] hire somebody in and they go don't curse
[1:08:46] around him same way with me in the post
[1:08:50] office you walk in the post office you
[1:08:52] go to work and somebody lets out one of
[1:08:53] them words that you used to say a long
[1:08:55] time ago and then they look and go I'm
[1:08:58] so sorry I said you know what I always
[1:09:02] say I said don't tell me you're sorry I
[1:09:06] can't do anything about it and then they
[1:09:10] realize what I'm talking about you need
[1:09:12] to tell you know like they always say
[1:09:13] the man upstairs you need to tell the
[1:09:15] man upstairs that you're sorry why are
[1:09:17] you telling me you're sorry but you know
[1:09:20] they do that though for honor you
[1:09:21] because they know you're different cause
[1:09:22] if not the oh you walked in and you
[1:09:24] blurted out the same thing they did
[1:09:26] right cuz that was that old nature that
[1:09:29] we had they just went right with them
[1:09:31] because they were your brethren at that
[1:09:33] time and you know and and and there's
[1:09:36] brother Bob in that hole I means in your
[1:09:38] complex a couple hundred five hundred
[1:09:41] people in one complex and there's you
[1:09:44] and Ben you yeah and there's two people
[1:09:47] in five hundred but they know who he is
[1:09:52] and who they still he stands for why
[1:09:56] because he had a private ceremony with
[1:09:59] God and got the new birth and God cut
[1:10:03] the foreskin off in a private moment
[1:10:05] right brother brems said it's an
[1:10:08] individual affair with God right private
[1:10:11] moment with God but as Bob walks through
[1:10:13] the world he walks a little different
[1:10:16] because he had been circumcised Israel
[1:10:19] Jacob when he was turned to Israel
[1:10:21] remember slapped him on the thigh then
[1:10:24] afterwards everybody knew even if they
[1:10:28] did and they said Jacob he's number
[1:10:30] names Israel he said Jacob why you won't
[1:10:33] like it he said I met an angel I met God
[1:10:39] I rassled we got he said what you look
[1:10:41] pretty bad he said no he told me I'd be
[1:10:43] this way for the rest of my life but he
[1:10:45] said everywhere I go they know by the
[1:10:48] way I walk a man by the way I walk in my
[1:10:53] journey they know that now I'm the
[1:10:56] limping Prince because I have been
[1:10:58] somewhere with God
[1:10:59] same way with now Abram is going to be
[1:11:02] Abraham and Abraham is going to get
[1:11:04] serious about this you and I the new
[1:11:11] birth is serious a serious business it
[1:11:14] was serious business when God said Abram
[1:11:17] I'm gonna change your name to Abraham
[1:11:18] but they something got to go with it
[1:11:23] they something got to go with it now you
[1:11:25] gotta show me Abraham that you got faith
[1:11:31] you go circumcise yourself and everybody
[1:11:35] in your household
[1:11:36] it's got to be circumcised and then that
[1:11:40] one thing come all the way down even
[1:11:43] into Jesus this time because that's how
[1:11:46] they separated from the Gentiles and the
[1:11:48] Jews you could prove it because they all
[1:11:52] kind of look the same
[1:11:53] Iranians Iraqis and all the different
[1:11:56] ones they dressed the pretty much the
[1:11:57] same but when they took him into the
[1:12:00] temple and showed them the private thing
[1:12:05] that God had done for him that was there
[1:12:07] what that was their covenant we're
[1:12:09] circumcised you're not and you know what
[1:12:12] God honored that for a certain time God
[1:12:15] honored that for a certain time that's
[1:12:17] why this is not an eternal covenant it's
[1:12:19] an everlasting covenant because an
[1:12:22] eternal covenant goes forever an
[1:12:24] everlasting covenant it covered until
[1:12:26] Christ came and even he was circumcised
[1:12:29] on the eighth day
[1:12:30] that's why circumcision on the eighth
[1:12:32] day there you put into the eighth day
[1:12:34] into eternity all right but Jesus was
[1:12:36] circumcised on the eighth day but when
[1:12:39] he went to Calvary he circumcised his
[1:12:41] whole body his whole body was given for
[1:12:44] us his whole and as brother Dale said
[1:12:46] now there was the son of man in human
[1:12:48] flesh because the seal of circumcision
[1:12:51] came to
[1:12:51] man in human flesh the physical one so
[1:12:55] there had to be a son of man coming
[1:12:57] human flesh - what he circumcised what
[1:13:00] the heart but right here not the heart
[1:13:02] boom boom boom boom the heart of you the
[1:13:05] thinking part everything he he
[1:13:07] circumcised now that's what Paul was
[1:13:09] trying to tell him he said you meal in
[1:13:11] circumcision the circumcision I really
[1:13:12] don't care
[1:13:13] it's a circumcision of the heart is what
[1:13:16] matters
[1:13:17] it's the heart circumcision Ezekiel 36
[1:13:22] verse 25 says for I will take from you
[1:13:24] among the heathen and gather you're out
[1:13:26] of the country we were reading this
[1:13:27] minute ago but watch then will I
[1:13:29] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[1:13:31] shall be clean for all your filthiness
[1:13:32] and from your idols will I cleanse you a
[1:13:34] new heart also while I give you in a new
[1:13:37] spirit while I put within you that's
[1:13:39] sanctification and I will take away the
[1:13:41] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:13:42] give you a heart of flesh and I will put
[1:13:45] my spirit now if that's God talking to
[1:13:48] us
[1:13:48] oh come on folks what a promise that's
[1:13:52] God speaking to us and he said I'm not
[1:13:55] gonna give you a spirit of fear I'm not
[1:13:58] gonna give you a spirit of a devil I'm
[1:14:00] not gonna I'm gonna give you my spirit
[1:14:04] and I can't listen as good as my daddy
[1:14:07] is he can't put his spirit in me his
[1:14:12] right the best person in the world can't
[1:14:16] give you his spirit but God can God can
[1:14:20] cuz he said I will I'll put my spirit
[1:14:23] look how close that is I'll put my
[1:14:26] spirit inside of you and when I put my
[1:14:29] spirit inside of you you gonna start
[1:14:31] acting like me because before you did
[1:14:35] not act like God and we have a hard time
[1:14:39] still doing it but we have that rudder
[1:14:41] inside now that moves us we got the boat
[1:14:45] we got the water you're justified and
[1:14:48] sanctified but if you don't get the
[1:14:50] baptism the Holy Ghost Satan's gonna
[1:14:51] knock you around everywhere and you have
[1:14:53] no rudder to get you back in but that
[1:14:54] rudder will turn you right where you
[1:14:56] need to go because the comforter will
[1:14:59] come and lead you and guide you into all
[1:15:02] truth and you know what let's think
[1:15:03] about this other day
[1:15:05] out in open water really not so
[1:15:08] important to have a rudder but when you
[1:15:10] get among the rocks when you get close
[1:15:13] to the shore you don't want to be blown
[1:15:16] into a shipwreck you want to have a
[1:15:18] rudder that'll turn you and get you out
[1:15:19] of that situation that you get in that
[1:15:22] we that we get ourselves in you have
[1:15:25] that spiritual rudder that'll turn you
[1:15:27] right same all of us that spiritual
[1:15:30] rudder say no that sounds good looks
[1:15:33] good no that's a wreck you go this way
[1:15:36] ma'am I love that that's what he's doing
[1:15:39] showing with Abraham Abram you don't got
[1:15:42] much of a rudder you got Hagar you got
[1:15:44] I'm going to eat you up enough I'm
[1:15:46] trying to do everything God you got me
[1:15:49] to do I'm trying to and God sitting
[1:15:51] circumcision I'm gonna change your name
[1:15:54] I'm gonna make you walk different and
[1:15:56] I'm even gonna change your wife's name
[1:16:00] I'm gonna change your wife's name and
[1:16:03] now you Abraham are going to be with you
[1:16:08] Sarah and you both are gonna have a baby
[1:16:12] which is the promise I promised you 25
[1:16:16] years ago to me that's what God does
[1:16:21] it's a new birth the only reason I know
[1:16:27] I have the new birth today you said the
[1:16:28] only reason is that I have clarity of
[1:16:31] the word yeah you can put it in you pile
[1:16:37] it on everything else I don't smoke I
[1:16:39] don't drink I don't curse anymore don't
[1:16:41] do it that was it sanctification that
[1:16:43] don't mean nothing for the new birth but
[1:16:46] when God changed my name from Center to
[1:16:48] Saint or our old man to new man there
[1:16:54] become clarity so I brought late your
[1:16:56] preacher I don't matter
[1:16:58] God is obligated to give you clarity of
[1:17:02] the word because he said I'll leaves you
[1:17:05] and guide you into some truth haha I'll
[1:17:09] lead you and guide you into all why
[1:17:13] because the man that wrote it is inside
[1:17:16] you agreeing with what
[1:17:18] he's already wrote what brother Dale was
[1:17:23] telling Mike this morning you you can't
[1:17:25] disagree with the word and be born again
[1:17:27] now it's sanctification you can't
[1:17:29] because you have no rudder I think this
[1:17:33] is I think this is oh I got the Holy
[1:17:36] Ghost oh I know that's why I said that
[1:17:37] now and even in life when you go out in
[1:17:40] life same thing you got that spiritual
[1:17:42] rudder and you know like I said before
[1:17:44] the boats huge the waters huge a rudders
[1:17:48] not but about this big anywhere on the
[1:17:49] big boat but without that thing turning
[1:17:53] man we was on that cruise ship ten
[1:17:57] stories high twenty five hundred people
[1:18:00] and he showed us the stabilizers that
[1:18:05] went out on each side of the boat they
[1:18:06] were about ten feet long each side and
[1:18:09] they by computer when the boat would go
[1:18:12] one way the rudder would and I'm telling
[1:18:16] you we never felt the boat move even
[1:18:18] when they make parallel park Ryan I'd
[1:18:22] you like the parallel park hit chicken
[1:18:24] truck but we get to Juneau Alaska and he
[1:18:28] comes right up between two boats and he
[1:18:30] goes why because he had rudders he had
[1:18:35] everything he needed to turn that big ol
[1:18:39] huge boat with 2,500 people the master
[1:18:43] controller all he had to do is turn one
[1:18:45] little knob same way in Christianity if
[1:18:49] we let go and let God we've got the
[1:18:51] spiritual rudder left they got what
[1:18:52] brother Brown say what a guy it was a
[1:18:56] guy in the control tower that was doing
[1:18:58] the work
[1:19:00] same way with Abram Abram now has a
[1:19:04] rudder or something that can guide him
[1:19:07] so he goes oh me and Sarah but God you
[1:19:13] still go have to do something because
[1:19:15] I'm 99 she's 80 something ain't
[1:19:20] happening
[1:19:22] right but God says is there anything too
[1:19:25] hard for God is there anything too hard
[1:19:29] for God you know he didn't look at the
[1:19:31] circumstances let's turn over
[1:19:34] to chapter 18 finally get to chapter 8
[1:19:38] I'm not gonna read the everybody knows
[1:19:40] that when he gives you the Holy Spirit
[1:19:42] he puts his spirit and we talked about
[1:19:43] that so we don't have to read all these
[1:19:45] quotes all right everybody okay with
[1:19:48] that
[1:19:48] let's do read one oh sorry mister
[1:19:52] let's read number seven I want to read
[1:19:54] that one I brought it in no read quote
[1:19:58] number seven I brought this in the other
[1:20:00] night and I want to read it
[1:20:02] number seven there you go Israel in the
[1:20:04] church beautiful God took Christ at
[1:20:06] Calvary tore him apart soul and body
[1:20:08] he sent the body up to his right hand
[1:20:10] and sent the Holy Spirit by the Covenant
[1:20:13] with the people and you believe by faith
[1:20:16] like Abraham did listen to this he was
[1:20:20] given the seal of circumcision for a
[1:20:23] confirmation of his faith for a
[1:20:27] confirmation of his faith and you
[1:20:30] believe and accept Jesus as your Savior
[1:20:32] then God gives you the baptism of the
[1:20:35] Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your
[1:20:37] faith
[1:20:38] Wow you say you believe and haven't
[1:20:43] received the Holy Spirit something's
[1:20:44] wrong with your face God circumcised
[1:20:48] this to heart the minute the believer
[1:20:50] really comes in full surrender amen say
[1:20:56] that folks surely must have done
[1:20:58] something
[1:20:59] I felt that come back now he felt that
[1:21:02] from somebody out in the audience said
[1:21:03] ah wait a minute no this is too easy get
[1:21:07] it when the believer here it is now he's
[1:21:10] thinking to whoever that person was he
[1:21:12] felt the spirit kind of popped back on
[1:21:14] him when the believer firmly believes on
[1:21:17] the Lord Jesus Christ God's under
[1:21:20] obligation to give him the Holy Ghost
[1:21:23] confirmation of his faith say what's the
[1:21:28] matter brother Branham just your faith
[1:21:29] that's all if you'd surely believed
[1:21:34] God's there to give it to you somebody
[1:21:37] was in that audience said I don't
[1:21:40] believe that you know if I was a
[1:21:41] preacher I'd be going to last one you
[1:21:43] don't get any because you know I believe
[1:21:44] in what is that what
[1:21:45] this is this is what God told us had to
[1:21:47] do because Peter
[1:21:48] while Peter spake these words see I bet
[1:21:51] it was I said that I say it was the
[1:21:53] Pentecostal saying you got to speak in
[1:21:55] tongues you got to do this you got to do
[1:21:56] that and brother Brown I'm saying
[1:21:58] while Peter spake these words the Holy
[1:22:00] Ghost fell on them they heard the word
[1:22:02] that's too simple for a Pentecostal
[1:22:05] that's rared under speaking tongues XYZ
[1:22:09] that's who he was talking to and they're
[1:22:11] back there going no you got speaking to
[1:22:13] him he he discerned that spirit he said
[1:22:15] no and he quoted him scripture while
[1:22:19] Peters bait these words the Holy Ghost
[1:22:20] fell on them they heard the word is that
[1:22:22] right acts 10 49 alright notice the Holy
[1:22:24] Ghost and fire came from heaven burn out
[1:22:26] all the dross circumcise the heart cut
[1:22:28] off all the surplus and you became a new
[1:22:31] creature what you became Abraham you
[1:22:34] weren't Abram Abram anymore
[1:22:37] let's read number eight go ahead to the
[1:22:39] number eight in there brothers
[1:22:41] I forgot I put these in here he said oh
[1:22:44] I thought I got the Holy Ghost when I
[1:22:45] believe they still teach that but it's
[1:22:49] wrong listen this faith all right faith
[1:22:54] is good faith God abraham believed God
[1:22:56] and it was imputed unto him by or for
[1:23:00] righteousness but God give him the seal
[1:23:02] of circumcision as a seal of his face so
[1:23:08] he could you know I says what he's
[1:23:09] saying is just like what I'm saying
[1:23:11] sanctification a lot of you Pentecostals
[1:23:14] you you don't have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:23:17] hard to say because they say I spoke in
[1:23:19] tongues I shouted I did this I did that
[1:23:21] I did the other that's when the unclean
[1:23:23] spirit went out but it don't matter it
[1:23:25] don't mean that that God filled it with
[1:23:27] anything it means they went back to
[1:23:30] their old denomination and they hung on
[1:23:31] that because remember brother Brennaman
[1:23:33] I knew it Oh a Pentecostal that he was a
[1:23:37] mean guy and brother branham say they be
[1:23:39] mean as a but meaner than a buzz saw why
[1:23:41] they kept that temper and all that but
[1:23:43] they spoke in tongues like the one that
[1:23:44] went and went with this girl and went
[1:23:46] off and committed adultery with her well
[1:23:47] well he's okay because he was speaking
[1:23:49] in tongues it see they held every bit of
[1:23:51] that on and that's what brother Brown
[1:23:53] was having to deal with and this was in
[1:23:56] nineteen fifty something but
[1:23:59] he will sit but when you got what God
[1:24:02] give him the seal of circumcision as a
[1:24:03] seal of his faith brethren when you get
[1:24:05] pure genuine faith in God God will give
[1:24:09] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[1:24:11] seal of the promise which is a seal that
[1:24:15] you have faith being making you the
[1:24:18] faith seed of Abraham right
[1:24:21] you might make us some kind of
[1:24:23] impression or make people believe or you
[1:24:25] might say you got faith but when you
[1:24:27] really got genuine unadulterated faith
[1:24:31] God will give you the baptism of the
[1:24:33] holy ghost of the seal of the promise
[1:24:35] that's not skim milk now children
[1:24:38] that's not skim milk that's God telling
[1:24:42] us what's going on let's go to Roman's 4
[1:24:47] verse 19 let's read scripture that okay
[1:24:51] we'll read description then we'll close
[1:24:52] we're not gonna get to 18 I'll start 18
[1:24:54] next week sometime well we're gonna
[1:24:57] really only have one service next Sunday
[1:24:58] so so we cover it later that's okay who
[1:25:04] against hope
[1:25:04] look Romans 4 verse 9 there you go
[1:25:09] cometh this blessedness upon them the
[1:25:12] circumcision only or upon the
[1:25:14] circumcision also now this is Paul
[1:25:17] talking to the Romans give me a little
[1:25:20] bit of you tension that sleepy spirit
[1:25:22] y'all must have went home and got them
[1:25:23] from your wives and brought them in here
[1:25:25] yeah well sorry sorry ladies
[1:25:28] we didn't have it well we got two extra
[1:25:33] people today that weren't hearing a
[1:25:34] couple reasons
[1:25:36] okay comesss blessing this upon the
[1:25:38] circumcision only upon the
[1:25:39] uncircumcision also he's talking to
[1:25:41] Romans who were what totally
[1:25:44] uncircumcised okay they were heathens
[1:25:47] they weren't Christians but Paul is
[1:25:49] telling them it doesn't matter about
[1:25:52] what I can show you in my private it's
[1:25:55] the circumcision of the heart now
[1:25:57] because Christ died on the cross that
[1:25:59] other was a was a temporary promise amen
[1:26:04] to Calvary just like just exactly like
[1:26:09] the blood of bulls and goats was a
[1:26:11] temporary sacrifice
[1:26:13] unto Calvary and that when when Christ
[1:26:16] came and died it took away any any any
[1:26:19] sacrifice you had to make no no animal
[1:26:23] sacrifices after Christ died on the
[1:26:25] cross they've done away with that same
[1:26:27] way with circumcision and they were they
[1:26:29] were standing there saying we be
[1:26:31] Abraham's seed because why they were
[1:26:32] circumcised you know what if first Jesus
[1:26:36] Ida said well oh my you know my what
[1:26:39] were you dealing with me for so am i I'm
[1:26:41] under this circumcision that you say but
[1:26:44] when but when the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:26:45] day of Pentecost see that does away with
[1:26:47] every bit of that it was a circumcised
[1:26:49] circumcision then of the heart cometh
[1:26:52] this blessing this then upon the
[1:26:53] circumcision only or upon the
[1:26:55] uncircumcision also for we say that
[1:26:57] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[1:26:59] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[1:27:02] when he was in circumcision or in
[1:27:05] uncircumcision and probably all the Jews
[1:27:08] around him said well when he got
[1:27:10] circumcised he became God made the
[1:27:13] promise when O Abram was still a Gentile
[1:27:17] uncircumcised so God made the promise
[1:27:21] with you when you were an uncircumcised
[1:27:23] in the heart he made the promise cuz
[1:27:26] what he said how was it reckoned in was
[1:27:28] it in circumcision or an uncircumcision
[1:27:29] not in circumcision because remember
[1:27:33] circumcision was a sign of Abraham's
[1:27:36] faith in God right
[1:27:40] not in circumcision but in
[1:27:42] uncircumcision and he received the sign
[1:27:44] of circumcision a seal of the
[1:27:47] righteousness of the faith which he had
[1:27:49] yet being uncircumcised even in your
[1:27:53] justification folks if it is a pure
[1:27:56] justification where you don't justify
[1:27:58] yourself where God justifies you it's
[1:28:01] God doing the work you're not you're
[1:28:04] still contrary but it's gone doing the
[1:28:07] work he but somewhere down in there
[1:28:09] you've got a tie post you've got
[1:28:11] something like I said before that light
[1:28:14] that was circling around Abram it was
[1:28:16] circling around you if you could look in
[1:28:18] another dimension it was way below you
[1:28:20] were doing the things you were doing it
[1:28:23] was right there it was brewed
[1:28:27] waiting or what you to make a decision
[1:28:29] and he received the sign of circumcision
[1:28:31] the seal of the righteousness of the
[1:28:33] faith which he had yet been
[1:28:35] uncircumcised that he might be the
[1:28:38] father of all them that believe that's
[1:28:44] all of us though they be not circumcised
[1:28:51] he's telling the Romans don't worry you
[1:28:54] ain't got to go be physically
[1:28:55] circumcised listen to what I'm saying
[1:28:58] God will circumcise your heart if you'll
[1:29:01] have faith that he might be the father
[1:29:04] of all them that believe though they be
[1:29:06] not circumcised that righteousness might
[1:29:08] be imputed righteousness hmm
[1:29:15] righteousness might be imputed or
[1:29:18] imparted unto us also or them also and
[1:29:22] the father of circumcision to them who
[1:29:26] are not of the circumcision only but who
[1:29:30] also walk in the steps of that faith of
[1:29:33] our father Abraham what faith that faith
[1:29:35] that took him through that journey to
[1:29:37] meet Melchizedek and human flesh that
[1:29:40] faith of our father Abraham which he had
[1:29:43] being yet uncircumcised for the promise
[1:29:46] that he should be the heir of the world
[1:29:48] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[1:29:50] through the law but through the
[1:29:53] righteousness of faith the law didn't
[1:29:56] give you anything to law condemned you
[1:29:59] but faith gave you everything let's go
[1:30:03] to Roman's 4:18 we'll stop right here
[1:30:07] we'll read this and then we'll be done
[1:30:09] to get a song ready brother we still
[1:30:14] talking in Romans 4 verse 18 who against
[1:30:17] hope believed in hope that he might
[1:30:20] become the father of many nations
[1:30:21] according to that which was spoken so
[1:30:24] shall thy seed be what he believed the
[1:30:27] word he didn't have a word written down
[1:30:31] but you and I got it written down who
[1:30:35] against hope believed in hope that he
[1:30:37] might become the father of many nations
[1:30:38] according to the
[1:30:39] which was spoken so shall thy seed be
[1:30:41] and being not weak in faith now look if
[1:30:44] we read the whole commentary of Abram
[1:30:47] you would think he wavered and staggered
[1:30:51] and and went everywhere he didn't have
[1:30:54] that rudder as we were talking about and
[1:30:56] physically he did in his walk he gave
[1:31:00] his wife away and all these different
[1:31:01] things don't ever try that but now Paul
[1:31:06] looking through Calvary that that
[1:31:11] eradicated everything there at Calvary
[1:31:13] all right but now look and being not
[1:31:17] weak in faith he considered not his own
[1:31:19] body now dead when he was about a
[1:31:21] hundred years old neither yet the
[1:31:23] deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered
[1:31:26] not at the promise of God he's not going
[1:31:29] to come up we're not going to come up -
[1:31:31] we're not going to go through the white
[1:31:32] throne judgment thank God and I truly
[1:31:36] thank God because if not we're gonna
[1:31:39] have to stand before God and give a
[1:31:42] reckoning of what we staggered on but
[1:31:47] we're not because we remember were the
[1:31:51] sinless perfect bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:53] that's our promise but he staggered not
[1:31:56] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:31:57] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:31:59] God and being fully persuaded that what
[1:32:03] he had promised he was able to perform
[1:32:05] and therefore it was imputed our pardon
[1:32:08] are reckoned to him for righteousness
[1:32:10] now it was written look here's one of
[1:32:14] one stop and then we'll we'll get into
[1:32:16] the Melchizedek later on now it was not
[1:32:19] written for his sake alone that it was
[1:32:22] imputed to him that's wonderful that
[1:32:24] that all happened to Abram and that
[1:32:25] happened to Abraham and that all and
[1:32:28] them over there them Jews they can say
[1:32:30] they're the father of Abraham because
[1:32:31] they're in circumcision and they're
[1:32:32] doing this and they're waiting on them
[1:32:34] aside and they're you understand what
[1:32:36] I'm saying they love Abraham over there
[1:32:38] the Israel the Jews do that are not
[1:32:40] converted because they say they're the
[1:32:42] children of Abraham because that's what
[1:32:43] they told Jesus they said we're seed
[1:32:46] Abraham what's your problem but now here
[1:32:50] we are it was not written for his sake
[1:32:52] alone that it was a
[1:32:53] to him but for us also to whom it shall
[1:32:57] be imputed if if we believe on him that
[1:33:04] raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead
[1:33:06] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:33:09] who was raised again for our
[1:33:13] justification when we look next Sunday
[1:33:18] at a resurrection he raised for your
[1:33:23] justification because he's just and the
[1:33:28] justifier of all of us that believe in
[1:33:32] him let's stand to our feet we'll get to
[1:33:38] Melchizedek he's still gonna be right
[1:33:41] there in chapter 18 England leaf so hey
[1:33:44] we just got to get to chapter 18 but
[1:33:46] he's not gonna leave - how great Dean
[1:33:48] he's gonna be right there but we must
[1:33:53] believe that being the children of
[1:33:56] Abraham that
[1:33:57] if you got the new birth today the whole
[1:34:01] use wiped out right zeroed out brother
[1:34:04] brown 0z you're zeroed out and God can't
[1:34:08] hold nothing against us you said well
[1:34:10] I've done this I've done this I'm just
[1:34:12] telling you what God said we have
[1:34:15] received the righteousness of God and we
[1:34:17] can't be judged if Christ has already
[1:34:19] been judged and God can't be judged
[1:34:22] because he is the judge but where's the
[1:34:25] judge today the judge is inside of us
[1:34:29] that's my brother ramps that we can't
[1:34:31] lose we got the judge the jury defense
[1:34:39] the other attorney it's all inside of us
[1:34:42] and he's saying not guilty not guilty
[1:34:46] and you know you know the song guilty
[1:34:49] I had nothing because we were guilty but
[1:34:52] when Christ came and died for us and
[1:34:54] then we accepted it and he accepts our
[1:34:57] faith by giving us the new birth then
[1:34:59] we're just as eternal as God is we're
[1:35:01] justice justice God is not saying will
[1:35:04] not make mistakes but we're gonna have
[1:35:06] to realize as we can
[1:35:07] 10 Ewing up this statue of a perfect man
[1:35:08] and heading to the headstone that man
[1:35:11] was perfect
[1:35:13] even in his human flesh he was perfect
[1:35:16] right he was without sin so guess what
[1:35:21] the only difference in that man and us
[1:35:23] is as we came by virgin birth we came by
[1:35:26] sin a product of sin and he wasn't a
[1:35:30] product of sin he didn't have a carnal
[1:35:32] mind you and I have a carnal mind that's
[1:35:34] what bothers us more than anything is
[1:35:35] this thing up here man so let's sing a
[1:35:37] song
[1:35:38] god bless you what pages that o61 in a
[1:35:45] spiral book Jesus is my Savior I shall
[1:35:52] not be moved in his love and favor I

[1:38:30] happen and also pray that though there's
[1:38:33] a 50% chance of rain in the extended
[1:38:35] forecast well you know what that means
[1:38:37] that 50% that 50% becomes a hundred if
[1:38:40] it's not raining so only 50% of the
[1:38:42] place it's gonna be raining the other 50
[1:38:44] it's gonna be not raining so we're just
[1:38:45] gonna pray that it's not gonna rain here
[1:38:47] and but we will be telling everyone
[1:38:49] online and brother Bob will be sending
[1:38:52] out the message of what we're going to
[1:38:55] do and how we're going to do it but
[1:38:57] listen truly listen to me we can't mess
[1:39:01] this up and start congregating I know we
[1:39:05] want to but you're gonna have to not
[1:39:08] shake hands you're gonna have to stay
[1:39:09] six feet probably I'm gonna suggest that
[1:39:13] you wear a face mask just in case you
[1:39:15] say well where'd you faith that Abraham
[1:39:17] I'm telling you I don't want I don't
[1:39:19] want because two churches in Georgia
[1:39:22] have have had services and they've got
[1:39:25] the virus one church in Madisonville
[1:39:28] Kentucky brother Brad was telling me
[1:39:32] they said now we're not gonna worry
[1:39:34] about it's nothing 22 people got the
[1:39:37] virus and one guys already died and the
[1:39:40] governor of Kentucky is using that
[1:39:42] church to try to get everybody else I
[1:39:45] mean is using it for an example we don't
[1:39:46] want to be an example of not doing but
[1:39:49] if you'll wash your hands and put that
[1:39:52] face mask on and stay six feet apart you
[1:39:54] can't get the virus so but we're just
[1:39:56] gonna pray that we're not gonna get it
[1:39:58] at all nowhere to be seen
[1:40:01] but we do want to have church service I
[1:40:03] know everybody I'm gonna tell this on
[1:40:05] brother Krantz
[1:40:07] I really thought really good when I
[1:40:09] called you the other day I thought well
[1:40:11] he's gonna go you know bees meet his
[1:40:12] brother Gary Krantz you know he said now
[1:40:14] brother way if if somebody else wants to
[1:40:17] come that'll be okay I know more got
[1:40:20] Sunday when I said day he said I'll be
[1:40:22] there then he never hesitated never said
[1:40:28] all now go away that's okay if somebody
[1:40:30] else come I said can you you want to
[1:40:32] come to church Sunday yes I'll be there
[1:40:34] so that's the excitement I love them
[1:40:37] that's what we all should be I know
[1:40:38] everybody's chomping at the bit trying
[1:40:40] to get through the trying to get through
[1:40:41] the screen to get to church because
[1:40:43] we're hurt animals we need to we need to
[1:40:46] get together and we need to fellowship
[1:40:47] so let's just pray that we can do that
[1:40:49] next Sunday but let's don't mess it up
[1:40:50] you need to go to the bathroom one at a
[1:40:52] time Church will be open but no social
[1:40:55] gathering afterwards please you're gonna
[1:40:58] have to either drive by and wave and say
[1:41:00] god bless you and going back to your
[1:41:02] home till this thing is over with but
[1:41:04] you know what the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:41:05] has a voice in this endtime we have a
[1:41:09] voice in this and that's what I said
[1:41:11] before even though the world may be
[1:41:13] doing what they're doing and they may
[1:41:14] I'm gonna say this in God's mind they
[1:41:17] may deserve it but them human people
[1:41:20] don't deserve it okay this world is just
[1:41:24] a sinful world and they sin everywhere
[1:41:26] but you know what we're in it just like
[1:41:29] Abraham wal Abram walked all through
[1:41:31] those and and you know what when Abram
[1:41:33] was walking I don't know if he said now
[1:41:35] I'm gonna possess all this but you know
[1:41:37] what God told him one time said
[1:41:38] everywhere you put your feet everywhere
[1:41:41] you put your feet and then we come down
[1:41:42] and see that brother ROM tells us in the
[1:41:45] endtime that footprints means possession
[1:41:47] so the same when brother Bob walks in
[1:41:50] that office up there with 500 people
[1:41:53] maybe raw heathens there's God in that
[1:41:56] building right same way with you guys
[1:41:58] there's God that light it's not right
[1:42:00] with brother Bob it's all around him
[1:42:03] ain't all of you any of you that work in
[1:42:06] an office or go to a sitting and you
[1:42:07] know all these different things we're to
[1:42:10] be the light to this world because there
[1:42:12] is no light outside of Jesus Christ
[1:42:14] there is no light outside of being a
[1:42:16] Christian there it's just total darkness
[1:42:19] and we see it now all the things that
[1:42:21] are half
[1:42:21] and out there people are just absolutely
[1:42:23] some people are literally going crazy
[1:42:25] because of this thing you know why
[1:42:27] because they're scared we don't need to
[1:42:30] be scared but we don't need to be
[1:42:32] foolish either but now I hope and I'm
[1:42:35] praying I said this so I said God speak
[1:42:37] to somebody it doesn't matter speak to
[1:42:41] somebody doesn't matter if it's if it's
[1:42:42] the janitor of the church speak to
[1:42:46] somebody and let them touch you or maybe
[1:42:51] I can't touch you let somebody touch you
[1:42:55] for these people I'd love to go to that
[1:42:57] Hospital and start touching the people
[1:42:59] and they'd just walk up and go home and
[1:43:01] God knows my heart I would love to do
[1:43:03] that I would do it if he told me to do
[1:43:04] it but remember we said still unless we
[1:43:08] have dust at the Lord if we have the
[1:43:09] Santhal Lord I hope God gives us as us
[1:43:11] that the Lord and somebody goes in you
[1:43:16] remember the story of John G Lake back
[1:43:19] in the Spanish pandemic they said they
[1:43:22] literally put the disease the foamy
[1:43:24] disease out of somebody's lungs put it
[1:43:27] in his hand and he had such faith till
[1:43:31] they put it under a microscope and every
[1:43:32] one of the virus turns were dead and he
[1:43:35] he was renowned for going and praying
[1:43:37] for people in this big epidemic that
[1:43:40] killed millions of people back in 1918
[1:43:43] 1718 so I just pray God you say what are
[1:43:47] you asking for listen we got the power
[1:43:50] we've got the power in the name of Jesus
[1:43:52] to turn these demons away so let's bind
[1:43:55] together this is our time this is our
[1:43:58] time as a bride it's our time not the
[1:44:01] government not then quit fighting over
[1:44:03] all that stuff my fights right here I
[1:44:07] don't know about yours I this old
[1:44:10] guy every day because he's out here on
[1:44:12] the outside having to live in this
[1:44:13] sinful world but there's an inside on
[1:44:16] the inside that groans travailing as
[1:44:20] romans 8 says waiting for the block
[1:44:23] manifestation of the sons of God that's
[1:44:27] me and you that's not everybody in the
[1:44:29] world
[1:44:30] so let's earnestly pray this week that
[1:44:33] those curves in them cities will
[1:44:35] going down and once they start going
[1:44:37] down we might get back to a little bit
[1:44:39] of normalcy and I'm gonna absolutely
[1:44:40] pray that the devil don't let that thing
[1:44:43] go back up hey man I want that I want
[1:44:45] this thing to be over with it's too many
[1:44:46] people die yes too many people and and
[1:44:50] dying alone I I pray for brother Diggs
[1:44:56] sister Gayle you can't go visit them you
[1:44:58] can't see him I pray the god will I pray
[1:45:02] God of keeping until we can see him
[1:45:05] again and if not that's okay but I'd
[1:45:07] like to see brother Dickon yeah brother
[1:45:10] Wilson Hembree and I'm sorry I'm taking
[1:45:12] time but I'm going to anyway brother
[1:45:13] Wilson Hembree sent me a text and he was
[1:45:16] that brother
[1:45:17] he was the song leader brother Wilson
[1:45:20] Henry's church before he came up here
[1:45:22] and brother Henry said I can just
[1:45:24] picture the young sister Gail and young
[1:45:27] brother dick getting up and singing in
[1:45:29] front of the church now I didn't know
[1:45:30] anything was real young
[1:45:32] some of y'all did but maybe if we ever
[1:45:35] see him again that's how we'll see him
[1:45:37] but I sure would like to see the old
[1:45:38] brother dick tail and all him singing
[1:45:41] his songs and him and sister girl
[1:45:42] singing together and him sitting in the
[1:45:44] bench we missed those people tom brother
[1:45:47] Gary and all the different ones but
[1:45:50] brother dicks right now so let's pray
[1:45:52] that if God's gonna take him on that's

[1:45:59] to see him again I'd like to be able to
[1:46:01] say god bless you one more time on this
[1:46:04] side and then if he goes on you know
[1:46:06] what he'll be one of them first ones
[1:46:08] that we know when they come walking

[1:46:14] walls we start having a service we're
