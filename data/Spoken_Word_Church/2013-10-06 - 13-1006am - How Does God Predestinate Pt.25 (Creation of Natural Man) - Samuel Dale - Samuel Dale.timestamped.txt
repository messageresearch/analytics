[4:21] that You' Just Have Your Way Now guide
[4:23] us in Jesus name amen Romans
[4:28] 8 28
[4:35] 8-31 for we know that all things work
[4:38] together for good to them that love God
[4:41] to them who are the called according to
[4:42] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[4:45] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[4:48] the image of his son that he might be
[4:50] the firstborn among many
[4:52] Brethren moreover whom he did
[4:54] predestinate them he also called and
[4:56] whom he called them he also Justified
[4:59] and whom he justified in me also
[5:01] glorified what shall we then say to
[5:04] these things what could we say to all of
[5:07] what he's done for us if God be for us
[5:09] who can be against us all right we'll go
[5:12] over to
[5:13] Genesis
[5:15] 2 and begin our
[5:20] thought thus the heavens and the Earth
[5:22] were finished and all the host of them
[5:24] and on the seventh day God ended his
[5:26] work which he had made and he rested on
[5:28] the seventh day from all his work which
[5:31] he had made remember it was 6,000 year I
[5:33] mean six days creating the Earth and
[5:36] then coming up to where that the seventh
[5:38] day would be the rest then on the
[5:41] seventh day God ended his work which he
[5:44] had made see all right and he rested on
[5:46] the seventh day from all his work which
[5:48] he had made and God blessed the seventh
[5:50] day and Sanctified it because that in it
[5:54] he had rested from all his work which
[5:56] God created and made these are the
[5:59] generations of the heavens and of the
[6:00] earth when they were created in the day
[6:03] that the Lord God made the earth and the
[6:05] heavens and every plant of the field
[6:08] before it was in the
[6:12] earth and every herb of the field before
[6:14] it grew for the Lord God had caused it
[6:17] to to not caused it to rain upon the
[6:20] Earth and there was not a man to till
[6:22] the ground but there went up a mist from
[6:24] the earth and watered the whole face of
[6:26] the ground and the Lord God formed Man
[6:28] Out of the Dust to the Earth see does to
[6:31] the ground and breathe into his nostrils
[6:34] the breath of life and he became a
[6:36] living Soul we pick up the next
[6:38] scriptures in on over so you may be
[6:41] seated uh the Lord add his Blessing to
[6:44] the reading of the
[6:46] word
[6:48] now we have
[6:50] been attempting to cover the things of
[6:56] seeing the
[6:58] creation and as we were reading there
[7:01] see the world was created and it was 6
[7:04] days if you want to call it 6,000 years
[7:07] that's fine because a day is a thousand
[7:08] years thousand years is a day in the
[7:10] Lord so it took God six days to make the
[7:13] Earth and all of the things and he made
[7:17] mankind on the last day all right then
[7:20] when he finished making
[7:22] mankind then he
[7:24] rested on the seventh day and then you
[7:27] go through where Jesus said come and
[7:29] unto me all ye that labor and heavy
[7:31] laden and I'll give you rest that would
[7:33] be speaking of throughout the scriptures
[7:35] and showing how that the children of
[7:37] Israel then was commanded to uh they
[7:40] would work six years and then they would
[7:43] rest the seventh that was an example
[7:45] because of the way God done all right
[7:48] then you would have that you work six
[7:50] days and rest the Sabbath you work six
[7:52] years and rest the Sabbath or
[7:55] sabatical and and they would do those
[7:58] things as an example of what happened in
[8:01] the
[8:02] creation of mankind and man's creation
[8:06] was on the sixth day and you know
[8:09] physical creation that then Genesis 2
[8:12] picks up and it really gives you a
[8:15] recap because really the man is created
[8:18] on the sixth day and it says there these
[8:21] are the generations of the heavens and
[8:22] the Earth and things so he's
[8:25] recapping the
[8:27] creation of life and things and then he
[8:30] comes down to the creation of
[8:33] mankind all right and we know in Genesis
[8:36] 2 Genesis 1 we've been covering verse
[8:40] 26- 28 of the creation of man where he
[8:45] says let us make man in our own image go
[8:48] ahead and pull that one up brother uh
[8:50] Richard and uh we'll read a little bit
[8:53] from Genesis 1 and we'll just you can
[8:56] read it as we scan down talking about it
[9:00] see then we've been through quite a
[9:01] lengthy discussion about how that man
[9:05] was
[9:06] made and we're talking about man now
[9:08] being made in the image of God because
[9:10] that's what the scripture said let us
[9:12] make man in our own image all right and
[9:16] God being a supernatural being you know
[9:21] then he created man first a supernatural
[9:24] being all right and that supernatural
[9:27] being would be there that he could as
[9:30] verse 28 talks about that he could rule
[9:33] the Earth the the animals
[9:35] Etc as a spiritual creation because
[9:38] that's in the image of God which is the
[9:40] interior part of us if you want to talk
[9:43] about it call it Soul being person of
[9:46] what we
[9:47] are you know you're you're made up of a
[9:49] body spirit and soul your body has five
[9:52] senses C taste feel smelling here your
[9:55] second realm of you has which is called
[9:57] a spirit realm it has like memory reason
[10:00] conscience affections Etc but then
[10:03] inside of a human being the difference
[10:06] between us and an
[10:08] animal the animal can have the senses up
[10:11] to a degree and it will work up to a
[10:13] degree you can train it to a degree it
[10:16] can do but it doesn't have a soul right
[10:20] because that was left for
[10:22] mankind to be a soul would be the image
[10:25] of God all right and that's what makes
[10:28] us so different from the animal you know
[10:30] the animal he's you you go out and tell
[10:33] the
[10:34] bird you need to build your nest a
[10:36] little different you know you go tell an
[10:38] eagle and he's got he's all of these
[10:40] thousands of years he's been going up in
[10:42] the highs of the rocks and you know he's
[10:45] been making his nest and putting it all
[10:47] up there and and you go up there and try
[10:49] to tell him so well you know it'd be
[10:51] more sensible if you got a little lower
[10:53] you know down closer to ground you
[10:55] wouldn't have to fly up so
[10:57] much but I'd say
[11:00] you know there's probably never very
[11:01] many snakes ever eats an egg of an eagle
[11:04] and the ones that gets closer to the
[11:06] ground they probably get a hold of but
[11:08] that eagle you can't tell him different
[11:09] why because he doesn't have a soul
[11:12] within himen all right but a man it says
[11:15] and we'll read it here you know as we
[11:17] read there and he became a uh form Man
[11:20] Out of the Dust of the earth and he
[11:22] breathed into his
[11:24] nostrils and he become a living Soul all
[11:27] right that soul of mankind is a great
[11:29] thing
[11:31] amen because that's like in the Old
[11:34] Testament when you had your animal
[11:35] sacrifices which were ordained of God to
[11:39] cover the sins of
[11:41] mankind but it could not eradicate it
[11:44] and there was nothing to be able to come
[11:46] back into the believer so he would do
[11:51] wrong you know he would commit adultery
[11:54] he would lie cheat steal Etc and as he
[11:58] did then he would go down and he would
[12:00] take a lamb and the lamb would be
[12:03] offered in his stead and his it would be
[12:06] marked off the things that he had done
[12:09] but yet he went right back with that
[12:10] same old desire to do wrong because he
[12:14] could not there was nothing to for the
[12:17] animal to be able to come back upon the
[12:18] human all right because the animal
[12:21] didn't have a soul right all right but
[12:23] see then we become into you know the
[12:27] point of being in a soul being soul is
[12:30] the word is being uh
[12:34] person you know and that's what we are
[12:37] and that's why Jesus Christ had to come
[12:40] and die to release his life the soul
[12:44] that would go out of him he said on the
[12:46] cross there you know my soul is troubled
[12:49] you know it had to be released out of
[12:52] there by death the where that he could
[12:55] come back into you and I to give us a
[12:58] new birth amen
[12:59] all right bring us in as as uh Jesus was
[13:03] talking to Nicodemus you know and he
[13:05] said you must be born again amen
[13:07] Nicodemus said you mean I've got to go
[13:08] back into my mother paraphrasing
[13:10] scripture but go back in my mother and
[13:13] be born a natural thing again and Jesus
[13:15] said if I tell you Earthly things or if
[13:18] I talk to you sensibly here and you
[13:20] don't understand me how you going to
[13:22] understand the great Heavenly things he
[13:24] said you must be born again all right so
[13:28] then it would be necess necessary that a
[13:29] human
[13:31] being to be anything in God we must be
[13:34] born again all right and to do that
[13:37] meant the soul of God would have to be
[13:39] released to where it could come back so
[13:41] on the day of
[13:43] Pentecost as we talk about there in the
[13:45] Bible when they were in the upper room
[13:47] and the Holy Spirit came it came down
[13:49] and it gave life to the people you know
[13:52] it gave a new birth all right 120 in the
[13:56] upper room then they went outside 3,000
[13:58] later
[13:59] and it started the church coming into
[14:02] the point of
[14:03] Salvation all right just giving you a
[14:05] little fist run through and that would
[14:08] make then the the the soul of man
[14:12] Eternal by the new birth all right
[14:14] that's why we must be born again but
[14:16] that soul of natural man look at it the
[14:20] Bible says nothing was withholden from
[14:23] man and you look at it as we were
[14:25] talking about the other day you look at
[14:27] The Marvelous thing uh that they can do
[14:31] in science and
[14:33] technology because of being a human
[14:37] being right you know who would ever
[14:40] thought as I tell you the kind of little
[14:42] joke about it but there was a man
[14:44] sitting one day listening to them tell
[14:46] that one day this is well on back you
[14:48] know said one of these days they're
[14:50] going to be flying airplanes across the
[14:52] world and you know and you'll be
[14:54] traveling here and doing that and the
[14:56] man just gets up and he just you know he
[14:59] lets them have it he said you ain't
[15:01] nothing but crazy you know you're a
[15:03] bunch of idiots so he goes over to his
[15:06] two boys and he said let's get out of
[15:08] here come on Arville and
[15:12] Wilbur well you know your history right
[15:15] who was the first ones that flew the
[15:16] airplane they just didn't listen to
[15:18] Daddy you know what and it's not
[15:21] listening to Daddy they wound up flying
[15:23] our planes well now we can get in our
[15:25] plane and fly faster than the speed of s
[15:29] you know I mean you just travel around
[15:32] the world now almost like an almost
[15:34] instant and then you pick up your
[15:36] telephone and you can just dial IND you
[15:39] and you can talk to them y right our
[15:42] life it's not a pause and a problem you
[15:46] can talk to him
[15:48] live right why because
[15:52] man that soul of man that God
[15:56] made when he breed into Adam he became a
[15:59] living Soul amen that soul of man being
[16:02] made made that man higher than any
[16:04] animal could ever be thought of Amen
[16:07] right all right and in doing that that
[16:11] man would have control of the animals
[16:15] and even in our fallen
[16:17] estate you know even after the fall came
[16:21] you look at Mankind and after 6,000
[16:25] years the animal is still afraid of man
[16:31] why see he smells the man coming into
[16:34] the woods the deer's gone right the
[16:37] virus smells the man he's
[16:39] leaving
[16:41] why because there's something about the
[16:46] animal that he he still has that
[16:48] connection to the
[16:50] fear of mankind all right why because of
[16:54] the soul of mankind amen cuz what have
[16:57] we done we come up with gun
[17:00] okay used to we shot little arrows you
[17:03] know you know or thr little Spar David
[17:07] would sling a rock you
[17:09] know and and I've always been amazed at
[17:12] them because reading your Bible you find
[17:14] out David had like 300 men that could
[17:16] throw at a highest
[17:18] breath you know I mean it ain't a gun in
[17:20] the country to hold a highest breath
[17:21] than 100
[17:22] yards you know Miss at the highest
[17:24] breath and shoot it's impossible but
[17:28] those men so well trained but yet still
[17:30] look at the gun David was limited to the
[17:32] amount of distance he could throw we
[17:35] take a gun now it's dangerous for 5
[17:38] miles they take these Sharpshooters they
[17:40] go out with these Special rifles and and
[17:43] they can just sit over there three or
[17:44] four miles away and just pick a guy off
[17:47] why because we've developed into such a
[17:49] high
[17:51] technology because of man having or
[17:54] being not just having a soul that's an
[17:57] odd way of saying it but man being a
[18:00] soul he turns out to be something
[18:04] marvelous even in his Fallen estate amen
[18:08] it's just unlimited what can
[18:12] happen you you look at it look at the uh
[18:14] brother Hal Thomas the other day was
[18:16] sister Anna you know Canard there you
[18:19] know you you she went they split her
[18:22] open they done triple by pass put her
[18:25] back together and say going
[18:27] home
[18:30] I'm wanting them to get around to where
[18:32] they can get they've getting to
[18:33] transplants on everything but I want a
[18:35] brain
[18:36] transplant you know I mean that's the
[18:39] one thing I want them to hurry up and do
[18:41] now I I want to choose who
[18:45] I the one I receive it from
[18:48] okay now just to make your life a little
[18:51] bit about life because what a marvelous
[18:55] thing we
[18:56] are look what man creat created
[19:00] it he he created us in such a marvelous
[19:03] situation until it used to be now it's
[19:06] kind of breaking down because of the
[19:08] deterioration but a newborn child used
[19:10] to be almost totally immune to any
[19:12] sickness for maybe the first six
[19:16] months right but now it's like I said
[19:19] everything's deteriorating so bad but
[19:22] what about God making something like you
[19:24] and I I don't have to tell my hand to
[19:27] move
[19:30] I I don't have to to force myself to
[19:33] speak you know I don't have to be
[19:35] trained to
[19:37] talk I never could figure out how you
[19:39] spell pneumonia with a p but they do but
[19:43] you know a little child that's 2 years
[19:45] old can say Daddy's got
[19:48] pneumonia will you think he knows what
[19:50] he's talking
[19:52] about no he's just heard it so we get a
[19:55] lot of training in our life but you know
[19:59] after a while he can go look it up in
[20:00] the
[20:01] dictionary right that's like Zach back
[20:03] there he he didn't like it when when
[20:06] they made him go to
[20:07] school and uh he you know kindergarten
[20:11] he didn't like it he turned against his
[20:14] mama and his Nanny and uh he even told
[20:17] his daddy said next time we go on
[20:18] vacation leave Mama at home cuz he
[20:21] didn't like it cuz it's making him go to
[20:23] school well they come to me and they
[20:26] said now Papa you got to do something
[20:31] you got to talk to that boy cuz he's
[20:32] upset with everybody and he don't want
[20:34] to go to school well I sat down and I
[20:36] talked with him and I said now listen
[20:38] Zach I said I want you to know a little
[20:41] something I said you remember when
[20:43] you're sitting around at about two or
[20:45] three months before Christmas or
[20:46] something and we're we're sitting there
[20:48] and we're going to get you a
[20:52] gun you don't know what that is do
[20:55] you said
[20:57] no I said because you don't know your
[21:00] you know you're you're not trained you
[21:02] you can't spell you can't do I said but
[21:05] if you go to
[21:07] school and you listen and you learn I
[21:10] said nobody won't be able to spell
[21:12] around you these big old words that you
[21:15] don't know what they are you know what
[21:17] he went the next day and he started
[21:18] making good grades right it was just a
[21:21] contact that was made with him because
[21:24] of what the soul that was within
[21:27] him not because of his human
[21:29] intelligence but because of a soul that
[21:32] was within him that you can contact all
[21:35] right now salvation then is a birth in
[21:38] the soul so I'm not speaking today to
[21:41] your
[21:43] head because you're sitting there
[21:45] thinking well I wish he'd hurry up and
[21:47] how long is he going to be and I want to
[21:48] get home I want to go get something to
[21:49] eat what are we going to have for lunch
[21:52] you know my Bottom's hurting my head's
[21:54] hurting this is
[21:56] hurting but see I'm trying to talk to
[21:59] the inside of you Amen to get you to
[22:04] think that part that's within us called
[22:07] a soul is a wonderful thing amen yes sir
[22:11] and he made man on the sixth day and he
[22:13] breathed into his nostrils verse 7 and
[22:17] he become a living
[22:18] Soul when a baby is born
[22:23] naturally all right that baby when it
[22:26] comes into
[22:27] life
[22:30] I know science says they're living in
[22:31] the wound and all this that and the
[22:33] other but just remember the animals the
[22:35] same way all right the animal in the
[22:37] wound is the same as a human in the
[22:39] wound I don't believe that it becomes a
[22:42] living Soul until God breathes the
[22:43] breath of life into the child and then
[22:46] it comes forth as a living Soul all
[22:50] right it it takes and it seems
[22:53] odd now here's an animal that doesn't
[22:56] have a soul
[23:00] and it seems odd of what happens in your
[23:03] first birth you know you can take a six
[23:05] week old puppy you can set it on the
[23:09] table it'll walk over to the edge and
[23:11] look
[23:14] off
[23:16] right it has enough intelligence not to
[23:19] move any further but the human being has
[23:21] to be trained a lot cuz you take
[23:25] a a six or eight 9 10 months some of our
[23:29] kids just kind of slow walking okay wa
[23:31] was 16 before he ever got where he could
[23:33] walk
[23:34] straight
[23:36] but you take that baby and you put it
[23:39] out you know what it'll do it'll crawl
[23:40] onside and fall right off the
[23:42] table but yet the intelligence in that
[23:45] baby is already vastly superior to the
[23:49] Animal Kingdom right because it it can
[23:54] goo it can do things and it'll start
[23:57] talking but yet see God knew when he
[24:00] made the man like that he made him
[24:02] special where he could talk to him amen
[24:05] made him where he could deal with him
[24:07] and fellowship with
[24:09] him because it's what he wanted if you
[24:12] want to take just a wording of it to say
[24:13] God was lonely amen right why because he
[24:17] was self-existing is the the best words
[24:19] we can
[24:20] get you know when you can go back to
[24:23] Elohim and all like that do the scholars
[24:26] they come up with the word Elohim to EXP
[24:28] BL self-existing
[24:30] and he existed alone but he was lonely
[24:33] he wanted something to fellowship with
[24:34] right you know he brought you an eye
[24:37] into being it was not enough to bring
[24:39] the animals he' already created the
[24:41] Angels right he created the animals he
[24:45] created all the world he had a lot to
[24:46] fellowship with but there was nothing
[24:48] like
[24:50] him cuz the animals not like him right
[24:53] it's you and I now physically
[24:56] speaking we come in image of the animal
[24:59] life because we were to be made higher
[25:02] and God done that where it could confuse
[25:04] mankind I don't believe in evolution but
[25:07] I do believe in Creative Evolution amen
[25:10] I believe God created one animal created
[25:12] another one another one another one
[25:14] another one higher order and that way
[25:17] the stupidity of mankind of Darwin and
[25:20] his theory of evolution could come up
[25:23] and conf you know destroy man's faith in
[25:26] God by saying we're just nothing but
[25:28] just a a
[25:30] monkey
[25:31] well we may act like it but that's a lot
[25:35] of difference in acting like in being
[25:36] one you know but we're in the highest
[25:39] form that could
[25:41] be and by putting that soul in mankind
[25:45] that was made in the image of
[25:48] God then we could be
[25:53] contacted all right and it took 4,000
[25:57] years of Earthly time for God to deal
[26:00] with
[26:01] Mankind and trying to get him to to come
[26:03] to him for
[26:04] salvation and like I said then it had to
[26:06] be that he had to come and die to
[26:09] release that life to be able to come
[26:11] back in you and I to give us a new birth
[26:13] amen that way then we could be
[26:18] contacted all right then think about it
[26:22] God thought
[26:24] enough of you and
[26:27] I to step down in human
[26:32] flesh that body was not God that was a
[26:35] human creation Hebrews 10:5 a body thou
[26:38] has prepared
[26:40] me but inside of that body was the very
[26:44] Soul and Spirit of almighty God that's
[26:48] why Jesus could say unless you believe
[26:49] that I am he you'll die in your sins
[26:52] that's why he would say they when they
[26:53] said show us the father he said have I
[26:55] been so long with you he said if you
[26:59] seen me youve seen the father that's
[27:02] scripture that's why we believe in the
[27:04] one true and living
[27:06] God not in the Trinity concept because
[27:09] that goes on over into too
[27:12] far because God is not a Trinity there's
[27:15] no such word in the Bible all right now
[27:19] but see then we we want to be come
[27:22] towards his image we wouldn't going to
[27:23] come towards a three person image
[27:26] right because even the says the Eternal
[27:29] godhead can be understood by the things
[27:31] that we see now I'm quoting scripture
[27:33] all right I'm a human being I'm a father
[27:37] I'm a son I have many many
[27:40] manifestations of myself but I'm only
[27:42] one and know was the way God was amen he
[27:46] come into being to die on a tree he said
[27:48] but God can't die hey come on you're
[27:51] right God can't
[27:52] die but he died in flesh that flesh died
[27:56] because the life EX did out of the flesh
[28:00] right into thy hands I commend my spirit
[28:03] all
[28:04] right out of that human body that we
[28:07] call Jesus God stepped out of it amen
[28:11] and left it hanging there on the cross
[28:14] they finally put it in the Tomb and he
[28:16] was busy doing some other work and when
[28:18] he was he came back picked up that body
[28:20] raised it in a glorified State all
[28:25] right but that's what he wants with me
[28:27] and you
[28:29] am he wants you and I to come to a
[28:33] place to where that we realize what's
[28:36] within
[28:37] us by the new birth amen we see what we
[28:40] are we're
[28:42] humans sold under
[28:44] sin right as we say about a little baby
[28:49] you know I mean there's a baby you know
[28:51] yourself you you raised him two years
[28:55] old he's got cookie all over his hand
[28:58] he's got cookie all over his face and
[29:00] you say did you get a cookie and he
[29:04] said right now who teaches him to lie
[29:08] that's
[29:09] right you know who taught the child to
[29:11] lie mama don't lie daddy don't lie of
[29:15] course A lot of times they do and they
[29:16] hear us too right you remember there in
[29:19] the Bible where the 40 the shoe buyers
[29:21] come out and eat up to 42 children you
[29:23] know Elisha you know the reason it was
[29:25] cuz Mama and Daddy was up fire saying go
[29:27] up old ballhead old ballhead said Elijah
[29:31] went up Elisha you talking about doing
[29:33] something
[29:35] too see sometimes we do put our kids in
[29:38] a lot of trouble because of our lying
[29:40] but you get the point we just we just
[29:42] naturally born to liar you hate to look
[29:44] at a little baby and say you ain't
[29:46] nothing but a
[29:47] liar but it's a truth they why up be
[29:50] that way why because we're born in
[29:52] Satan's domain out here this is his
[29:54] kingdom he offered it to Jesus right are
[29:57] you in the Bible right he offered to
[29:59] Jesus the world and the
[30:00] things and Jesus said no I'll pay the
[30:03] price that's right all right but see in
[30:06] doing
[30:07] that man is in the image of God God is
[30:11] just one and man is just one amen all
[30:15] right and see then that way we can look
[30:17] at God or or Mankind and and we can see
[30:20] and understand
[30:22] God because we see one another and KN
[30:25] who and we know who we are and know you
[30:27] know what's going
[30:28] on but see in that then we look at it
[30:32] that when he made the
[30:37] man we know that he made man and all the
[30:40] animal
[30:42] forms right all the animal forms he made
[30:44] male and female dog cat
[30:48] horse everything monkeys he made male
[30:50] and female but when he made Adam he just
[30:53] made Adam read your Bible we'll we'll
[30:56] come through a part of it taking pull
[30:58] that up and he just made
[31:01] Adam then he took a rib from Adam and
[31:06] made
[31:07] Eve
[31:08] all and Adam said now she's Flesh of My
[31:11] Flesh and bone of my
[31:13] bone she's a part of me that's the way a
[31:17] true husband and wife ought to be right
[31:19] after 55 years you know me and my wife
[31:22] would be going to town she said do you
[31:24] want I said yeah I want it
[31:26] done
[31:29] you understand what I mean she's asking
[31:30] where we going to
[31:32] eat and I'm not talking about eating I'm
[31:35] said y'all want it done I want it cooked
[31:37] or she'll say something I said what do
[31:38] you want to eat and she'll say uh I
[31:41] don't know whatever I said how do you
[31:43] want that cooked you know how do you
[31:45] cook whatever what I'm getting at is we
[31:47] Fellowship we talk about you know we we
[31:50] can bypass a lot of the whole line of
[31:54] talking right true husband and wife
[31:57] becomes one they can just byp pass that
[31:59] and you're thinking alike you even start
[32:01] looking alike right now a lot of people
[32:04] don't like that but that's true I can go
[32:06] into the science side of that that's
[32:09] Joyce and Danny never had a like of me
[32:10] to talk like that she's blonde he's
[32:13] blackheaded I ain't talking about that
[32:14] is after a while you start looking alike
[32:17] why because you're around each other so
[32:18] much all right but now think about
[32:22] it there as man was
[32:26] lonely as God was lonely
[32:28] and he wanted to bring man into
[32:29] existence where he could fellowship with
[32:31] him then when he brings Adam into
[32:34] existence he cannot fellowship with Eve
[32:36] because he's not in existence yet so he
[32:39] puts Adam to sleep and he takes a reib
[32:41] out right Genesis
[32:43] 2 and he makes him a help
[32:46] meet we miss that a lot because we want
[32:48] to use the word
[32:49] helpmate but it does not say that it
[32:52] says help meat me T it doesn't see say
[32:57] help mate m a t e go two men can be a
[33:00] mate two women can be a mate right right
[33:05] that's just meaning companion
[33:07] connections but a help meat means one of
[33:10] you or part of you Adam said she's Flesh
[33:12] of My Flesh and bone of my
[33:16] bone she was part of him
[33:20] amen now they were in the
[33:23] garden they could rule the garden and
[33:25] take care of it
[33:28] right well because they were in the
[33:30] image of
[33:33] God that inside part of
[33:37] them was in the image of the very God
[33:42] Amen Eve could say Adam the wind's
[33:44] blowing a little too strong you just say
[33:46] peace be still
[33:48] right
[33:50] right you want to see that again what
[33:52] did Jesus do when he was walking when
[33:54] they were out on the sea and he comes
[33:57] walking on the water I mean read your
[33:59] Bible come on he comes walking on the
[34:01] water walks right out to
[34:03] him and they were scared to death
[34:05] because the waves were going and just up
[34:06] and down and he just simply says peace
[34:09] be
[34:10] still the winds and the waves just calms
[34:13] away why because that was that man again
[34:16] standing on the earth that you and I
[34:17] should have been like
[34:19] amen right but we got all confused in
[34:22] the fall it was in the
[34:24] garden we got all messed up if you want
[34:27] to call it in our terminologies today
[34:29] our old flu got stopped up now you know
[34:32] what happens to a boiler or anything
[34:34] that the flu is get stopped up it's
[34:37] going to blow up somewhere and that's
[34:39] what happened in the garden
[34:42] is Satan begin to talk to Eve right and
[34:46] as he begin to talk to Eve he got her to
[34:51] reason and reasoning is fine because the
[34:54] Bible says come let us reason together
[34:56] that's fine
[34:58] if it stays with God and His word
[35:00] correctly amen all right but when we
[35:03] take Satan's ideas Paul said it later he
[35:06] said that we be
[35:08] uh confused or paraphrasing it saying
[35:11] that we wind up being uh like Eve who
[35:15] fell for Satan's
[35:18] lie right and see Satan had to to get
[35:23] some Road the devil as we call him uh
[35:28] he had to get some Road into the human
[35:30] race to be able to confuse you and I
[35:32] amen and as he did he picked
[35:36] Eve because Adam he could not do
[35:38] anything with him Adam in his original
[35:41] state the devil could not do anything
[35:43] with Adam because Adam was in the image
[35:44] of God right not degrading the woman
[35:47] because Eve was in
[35:49] Adam and you know how I preach and what
[35:52] I believe the Bible doesn't say in Eve
[35:55] all dies the Bible says in Adam all died
[35:57] right no matter what Eve done it was
[36:00] Adam who accepted the
[36:02] responsibility of the fact of what the
[36:04] Fallen condition was and he took Eve
[36:07] right right had he not done that God
[36:10] would have annihilated her right but yet
[36:14] he loved her he he cared for her she was
[36:16] part of
[36:18] him she had been there with him no
[36:20] telling how long that they would have
[36:21] been in the garden cuz remember it was
[36:23] in the day of
[36:25] rest that they fell right in the seventh
[36:28] day that was coming out as we would talk
[36:30] about the rest
[36:33] day and as it did she winds up in
[36:37] listening to
[36:39] Satan in his life say you'll be as God
[36:43] knowing good and evil you know and he
[36:47] begins to talk to
[36:49] her and he tells her
[36:52] said you were
[36:54] created for the purpose that's right but
[36:57] Adam is withholding that from you and so
[36:59] is God he's withholding from you the the
[37:03] fact of what you were created
[37:06] for you were created for
[37:09] multiplication and if it did then Eve
[37:11] went the wrong way with it right we can
[37:14] go through the serpent seed of what
[37:15] happened because you got to admit the
[37:16] Bible talks about a seed of the serpent
[37:19] all right but I'm not wanting to get
[37:20] onto that as much is to get on to one
[37:23] thing when mankind was
[37:26] made
[37:28] he was made in the image of
[37:33] God to desire after
[37:36] God to want to fellowship with him right
[37:40] God wanted that he loved
[37:42] it he could come down as we talk about
[37:45] it in the cool of the evening the
[37:47] prophet would say it this way come down
[37:48] in the cool of the evening and
[37:50] fellowship with Adam and Eve and he need
[37:54] lay them down put them to sleep and said
[37:56] you know
[37:58] wake up the next morning beautiful
[38:01] everything was running perfect in the
[38:04] garden why because they were there the
[38:07] way they were supposed to be right all
[38:10] right there was no sin there was no
[38:12] problem no heartaches no
[38:16] troubles and God would come down and
[38:18] fellowship with
[38:20] them you said well do you mean God came
[38:23] down well the Bible does say that when
[38:24] they done wrong God came down
[38:28] and said Adam Where Art
[38:31] Thou see God is not a um we want to talk
[38:37] about him as John 5:24 or something God
[38:40] is his Spirit they that worship Him must
[38:42] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[38:43] that's wonderful that's truth but you
[38:46] mean to tell me that you and I are
[38:48] something greater than he
[38:50] is you I mean look at us look what he
[38:54] made think about it
[38:58] they're talking about brother how Thomas
[38:59] now to put a little pacemaker in what
[39:01] about they just they just go
[39:04] through and they just drill a little
[39:07] hole and they go right through your rib
[39:09] cage and they just drill this thing into
[39:11] your
[39:13] heart and it's a screw but on the screw
[39:16] in I guess is what what is electrodes or
[39:18] whatever they're far and uh they just
[39:21] connect some wires to it put a little
[39:23] thing in there about size of a silver
[39:24] dollar and brother Thomas's heart rate
[39:28] went from 40 or 50 up to 80 you
[39:31] know amazing thing that mankind can do
[39:36] right I said they can take out a kidney
[39:40] put back in a
[39:42] kidney they could take out a
[39:46] heart right and even had a man live for
[39:50] how long a month or something one time
[39:52] with a mechanical heart you remember
[39:54] that when they first
[39:56] started
[39:59] what wonderful things mankind can do
[40:03] right unlimited to the things
[40:06] right you can almost travel like a
[40:08] thought because as I said about the
[40:10] telephone while ago you tell me that's
[40:12] not doing like a thought but you can
[40:14] talk straight to
[40:17] Africa used to even in the the
[40:20] beginnings you know they had to you had
[40:23] space and you could call and it spaced
[40:25] and you had to space out the hours Etc
[40:27] but now it's almost just
[40:30] instantly why because we're human
[40:33] beings but we've taken what God has
[40:36] given
[40:37] us the ability to think to reason to
[40:41] work out things we've taken that and we
[40:44] spin it all on the scientific
[40:46] side and thank God for automobiles I
[40:49] know Donnie he likes m models and
[40:51] they're beautiful to sit out there and
[40:53] look at but I'm not going to California
[40:55] with him in an a model
[40:57] now just not going why because we going
[41:00] to have to work on it all the way out
[41:01] there in
[41:02] back if we make
[41:05] it if I'm going to California give me a
[41:08] Cadillac let's go or get on airplane and
[41:11] go modern technology is
[41:15] great but you just think about what God
[41:18] what we've done with
[41:20] that we made everything so
[41:23] instant you
[41:25] know like was it John and Charles Wesley
[41:29] it was recorded of her that I think she
[41:31] had 12 kids I believe that's right and
[41:34] it was recorded of how many hours a day
[41:36] she sent with her spent with her
[41:38] children praying and and reading to them
[41:40] at night we know they didn't have
[41:42] washers and dryers and and stoves to
[41:45] cook and you know refrigerators to keep
[41:48] things in and this that and the other
[41:50] you
[41:51] know and here we are we got everything
[41:54] yep my wife she wanted a dishwasher
[41:56] years ago I got her one but she wouldn't
[41:59] do the dishes cuz that's Anna yeah you
[42:02] know I mean we got her a dishwasher but
[42:04] she wouldn't wash the
[42:06] dishes
[42:10] right but we did buy our
[42:12] dishwasher it's used about one time
[42:15] every 3
[42:16] months because she doesn't like it all
[42:20] but yet other people you know they'll
[42:21] just take everything boy everything
[42:22] comes off goes to the dishwasher you
[42:24] never touch it you just get ready to put
[42:26] them on the table take them up put them
[42:27] over here you know everything's great
[42:30] praise the Lord man I used to get up
[42:32] over morning before going to school when
[42:34] I was able to go to school cuz I play on
[42:36] the me most of the time but you have to
[42:39] get up and draw water from Mom them to
[42:41] boil and do the
[42:43] wash now you just going and flop in
[42:46] that's it but my point is what happened
[42:50] to the
[42:52] time you know my wife's got ever modern
[42:54] invention can be thought of in the
[42:56] kitchen
[42:57] I still don't have no
[43:02] time she don't have time to do this out
[43:05] of that why she's in the kitchen but you
[43:07] got all these modern inventions what
[43:08] would she be if she was having to get up
[43:10] build a fire in the wood Stone do all of
[43:13] the things
[43:14] and see we've let these things that
[43:17] Satan has brought in to us Captivate us
[43:21] and take us away from really what we
[43:23] need to
[43:26] be we don't want to throw those things
[43:28] away no way no I don't want to go back
[43:32] to horse and buggy uhuh no no way I like
[43:35] it where we're at I like the air

[43:48] the refrigerator and you know man you're
[43:49] just drinking Dr
[43:51] Pepper and modern inventions are
[43:55] wonderful but is it taking us so far
[43:57] away from God until we've forgotten
[43:59] about him
[44:00] right that's my whole point if he
[44:03] created us for worship created us for
[44:06] the basis of you know to come down and
[44:09] fellowship with
[44:12] us you know you wake up a lot during the
[44:16] night I do I wake up a lot during night
[44:18] get up and walk through the
[44:20] house you know what I don't blame God
[44:22] and saying well hey you're getting too
[44:24] old you're getting this you're getting
[44:25] old man you're getting to yeah you know
[44:27] no I said Thank you Lord for waking me
[44:31] up I do have the ability to walk through
[44:33] the house I have the ability to talk to
[44:37] you and that's when I pray a lot is just
[44:39] in the middle of the night because it's
[44:41] quieter well you know what in the middle
[44:43] of the night everybody else is asleep so
[44:45] me and God can talk he's not busy on the
[44:48] phone answering everybody else
[44:51] right he can talk to me and I like it
[44:54] that way CU I want to fellowship with
[44:56] him
[44:58] because that's what we need to be why
[45:00] not he made
[45:03] us right he created us he gave us life
[45:08] amen amen why wouldn't we want to give
[45:10] it back to him amen why would we not
[45:14] want to be just happy
[45:18] and have a good
[45:21] time as a Christian you got to run
[45:23] around with a sad face oh I'm a
[45:26] Christian I'm happy though no you ain't
[45:29] happy your face can't say
[45:32] it Jesus one day said there must have
[45:34] been a comical joke about it because
[45:36] Jesus told oh Herod one day he said go
[45:38] tell that
[45:40] fox it must have been a joke about Herod
[45:43] as being a
[45:45] fox see why can't we be happy as
[45:48] Christians
[45:51] right laughter the Bible says is a good
[45:55] medicine oh you get up every day oh I
[45:58] feel so
[46:00] bad you know what you do you a little
[46:02] bit you're going to feel bad you know
[46:04] what she going to be down to the
[46:04] doctor's office and he's going to be
[46:05] giving you some pills trying to make you
[46:07] feel
[46:08] good when I get up and be happy and say
[46:11] thank you Lord for salvation in my
[46:14] soul thank you for loving me and caring
[46:17] for me and giving me your own
[46:20] life brother Dale you're never down and
[46:24] out what's the saying around here when
[46:27] you call me what do I
[46:29] say laying in the hospital but what do I
[46:32] say hey I'm doing wonderful how are
[46:35] you why because he don't need bragging
[46:38] on the devil he got enough as it
[46:40] is right he got enough people going down
[46:43] that's what I tell the
[46:44] doctor I don't mind talking to them
[46:46] doctors just like I talked to you I told
[46:48] that the other day when he's thumping on
[46:49] my chest to check my spleen thing out
[46:51] and I said what are you doing that far
[46:55] he said well I'm checking your spleen I
[46:56] said Oh I thought you was doing that
[46:57] just make me think I was you that was
[46:59] something you supposed to do to let me
[47:00] know you was a doctor he just died
[47:03] laughing I don't you know why because
[47:07] he's a person just like we are I
[47:09] appreciate
[47:10] him thank God for
[47:13] doctors but thank God for the healing as
[47:16] brother col I read the scripture that he
[47:19] sent his word and healed us and Deliver
[47:21] Us from destruction sir why can't we
[47:25] accept it
[47:28] why can't we realize what we've been
[47:29] made
[47:32] for as it says there in Genesis 1 128
[47:35] you remember the other day when we were
[47:36] talking about we told Adam and Eve in
[47:38] their spiritual condition to multiply
[47:40] and replenish the Earth
[47:42] amen you realize that's what we're doing
[47:44] that's what I'm trying to do now is to
[47:46] take the word and talk to you about it
[47:48] and talk about God and his ways and and
[47:51] things to just to to try to get you to
[47:53] see the God that I
[47:55] serve
[47:59] why because he wants to talk to you he
[48:01] said now you're the preacher right don't
[48:02] have too with
[48:04] it no he wants to talk to all of his
[48:07] children amen right he wants to deliver
[48:10] he wants to do in all of the things to
[48:13] you and I but think about it now in the
[48:16] creation of Eve she wasn't made
[48:20] wrong she was made
[48:23] beautiful the most beautiful woman that
[48:25] was in the world probably
[48:30] ever will be in the world was
[48:34] Eve and Adam was
[48:37] happy as they could walk in the garden
[48:41] together and fellowship
[48:45] together why because she began to learn
[48:48] about God too y of what God's purpose
[48:51] and the things was
[48:55] for and see that's what you and I ought
[48:57] to be
[48:58] doing it's learning about God study his
[49:01] word you want to know about God read his
[49:03] word don't read a G's omac try to find
[49:05] about God no you find out how to plant
[49:08] your
[49:10] garden but read the
[49:13] Bible what's wrong with that have we
[49:15] throw it
[49:18] away now read
[49:20] it like I've told you they could have
[49:22] figured out in space you remember when
[49:24] they were trying to put the the all of
[49:25] the astronauts in space they wind up a
[49:27] day
[49:29] missing and they couldn't figure out how
[49:31] to get that all of those calculations
[49:34] together when one man there happened to
[49:37] be a a Christian and they said was
[49:39] anything you know of to where we can
[49:40] figure this out and he said yes in the
[49:43] Bible said the Bible says that there he
[49:46] asked a question when man did and and
[49:48] the son stood still with
[49:53] Joshua and it says about a day so they
[49:55] run their time calculations back to that
[49:57] period and they picked up all of the day
[50:00] except about this 20 minutes or 40
[50:02] minutes or something that they liked in
[50:04] their calculations and asked him said is
[50:06] there anything else he said yes said one
[50:08] time a man was dying and said God told
[50:11] him he wasn't going to die said he asked
[50:13] well how can it I be assured of this he
[50:15] said it's easy thing for the sun to go
[50:16] forward it said Let It Go backward you
[50:18] remember that in the Bible and it went
[50:20] back so many degrees that turned out to
[50:22] be the 20 minutes had they read their
[50:23] Bible they could have put the astronauts
[50:24] in
[50:25] space
[50:27] right and they had to come back to the
[50:29] Bible to find the answer to all things
[50:31] well it's got the answer to all of
[50:35] us but he made
[50:39] man and instilled within
[50:42] man the love for
[50:46] him he put everything under his
[50:51] control to where he would be the god of
[50:54] the earth if you want to call call him
[50:58] Jesus said you call him gods that the
[50:59] word come
[51:02] to we're not the god of Heaven no but we
[51:05] are the children of God Amen and the
[51:08] Earth is our domain right
[51:11] amen see we have a lot to do with that's
[51:14] what I was talking about a moment ago
[51:15] when you talking about smiling and
[51:17] talking and fellowshipping and joyous
[51:20] and happy we have a lot to do in this
[51:22] domain that we can conquer
[51:25] Satan
[51:27] amen you go into a doctor's office
[51:30] brother gir there his daddy was a chief
[51:32] surgeon of deap General Hospital for
[51:34] many
[51:35] years and he said the first thing he
[51:37] wanted them to do when they came into
[51:39] his office was to have a positive
[51:45] attitude that we were talking about this
[51:47] morning the lady brother random was
[51:48] talking
[51:51] about that brother around simply said to
[51:53] her said you've had this thing for you
[51:56] walk with these crutches for 2 years she
[51:58] had an opportunity right there to to be
[52:00] able to get over her understanding and
[52:02] get away with those crutches but she
[52:04] said yes and said I've I've had them for
[52:07] 5
[52:08] years he said and you will keep
[52:11] them
[52:14] why because she had lost all contact
[52:17] with trying to serve God in the right
[52:19] way she was more interested what the
[52:20] doctor
[52:23] said right well why can't we look at him
[52:26] in this life life and that doctor told
[52:27] me to take my kneecaps off 40 years
[52:30] ago that's what he told me he said Don't

[53:24] me and I questioned God I said what
[53:27] no so I laughed at him I said you ain't
[53:29] taking him

[53:44] of the table man and I'm on this side
[53:46] I'm the preacher puts them in the grave
[53:48] you're the guy that doctors them that's
[53:50] the way I talk to doctors cuz they're
[53:51] human
[53:52] beings they said you won't give me
[53:55] that now I'm not telling you not to take
[53:59] it but I'm just telling you God talk to

[54:29] you know there's a lot of people that
[54:30] can't get
[54:34] up
[54:36] right to have a positive attitude why
[54:39] because God is positive that's right he
[54:43] said his word and healed us he said amen
[54:46] right all right and we're brought here
[54:48] for the one
[54:50] purpose to serve God Amen that's what we
[54:53] need to do Eve was taken from
[54:57] Adam don't start counting your ribs guys
[55:00] and see if there's one
[55:03] missing Eve was taken from Adam to be
[55:06] part of Adam
[55:09] right and a true wife is a part of her
[55:11] husband right we got these songs today I
[55:15] stand by my
[55:18] man
[55:20] right my lady made it got 14
[55:24] husbands right she already to say I
[55:27] stood by my
[55:29] men instead of
[55:31] man but
[55:33] true lying through her
[55:37] teeth but it's the truth you ought to
[55:39] stand by you
[55:41] man is your husband that's right he's
[55:43] your
[55:45] helpmate he's the one to help
[55:49] you right amen a true husband and wife
[55:52] is a wonderful situation cuz that's in
[55:54] the image of God Amen you put them both
[55:57] together trying to be right and you see
[55:58] something right but you put them pulling
[56:01] and bickering and arguing first two
[56:04] years I told you you don't like my way
[56:07] of preaching but that's all right I told
[56:09] you the first time you marry you marry
[56:10] for
[56:11] lust right harmones is a factor you say
[56:15] oh love at first sight now I want to see
[56:18] that
[56:20] somewhere ain't no such thing as love at
[56:22] first sight you learn to love that's
[56:25] right that's right right y there was
[56:30] things my wife didn't like about me when
[56:31] me her married but you know what she
[56:33] loved me she got over
[56:40] it he said what are you talking
[56:43] about I'm talking about God making a
[56:48] man and making that man so much like him
[56:52] until it's an amazing thing that a man
[56:55] can be be
[56:58] right God wanted that fellowship with
[57:01] that man right amen he wanted the
[57:04] ability to come down in the garden and
[57:06] talk to Adam and Eve amen and he'd like
[57:09] to do that today to you and I if we just
[57:11] let
[57:12] him brother you believe in God talking
[57:15] to people I sure do I sure
[57:20] do it may be an inward speaking to you
[57:23] but what maybe that's the way he talk to
[57:25] Adam and Eve where we're talking about
[57:26] life not in Bible
[57:30] study I ask the question a lot of times
[57:32] and people laugh at me because it's not
[57:34] a dumb question maybe but I said if you
[57:37] say dog in
[57:39] Spanish are you thinking dog or are you
[57:41] speaking what is
[57:43] it perago ever I can't pronounce them
[57:46] but then we asked another sister what
[57:48] was hers in in Swahili you know and I
[57:51] said when you think of dog why don't you
[57:52] just say
[57:54] dog well you know what they're say dog
[57:57] but it's in their language that's right
[57:59] and you know that God can understand
[58:00] every language in the
[58:03] world right that's
[58:05] right you don't have to figure out how
[58:07] to talk to him just talk to him amen
[58:11] right brother D do you get down and you
[58:14] cry you no no sometimes I do sometimes I
[58:16] don't sometimes I walk around through
[58:18] the house just like if you heard me you
[58:19] say who in the world is he talking
[58:21] to I'm just talking to
[58:25] him
[58:26] I'm saying Lord now you know my problems
[58:28] my troubles and what I
[58:31] need I don't have to beg him plead with
[58:34] him no I just have to believe that he
[58:38] hears me cuz the Bible said if he Hearth
[58:41] us we have the petition that we ask
[58:44] for why because we're in His image think
[58:48] about
[58:49] it
[58:52] mankind a marvelous wonderful
[58:59] ful
[59:04] creation and God came
[59:06] down to be with mankind amen that's
[59:10] right and you know he didn't come down
[59:12] as a glob or a monkey looking something
[59:14] or whatever he came down to look just
[59:17] like
[59:18] us I believe when we get to heaven you
[59:20] know what we're going to see God not as
[59:23] a spirit floating around not as a doing
[59:25] because to me God is a being he's a
[59:28] person right
[59:30] right he's
[59:33] wonderful and he made man
[59:37] wonderful just like we're talking about
[59:39] a wife I'll end it with this talking
[59:40] about like even the prophet of God said
[59:43] one day like this he said God couldn't
[59:45] give a man nothing no greater than Sal
[59:48] you know Salvation is first but he said
[59:51] God give a man a good wife that's right
[59:56] that's a wonderful
[59:58] thing do you and Nanny get along and
[1:00:01] don't never fuss no no we have our
[1:00:03] problem she's her and I'm
[1:00:06] me and most of it's
[1:00:09] me I don't mind admitting
[1:00:14] that it's like I've always said to you I
[1:00:17] wouldn't care for my wife knowing any
[1:00:19] thought I ever
[1:00:21] had can you say
[1:00:24] that I would never care from my wife
[1:00:26] knowing every thought I had if she would
[1:00:30] hear the last one I had about the
[1:00:32] situation the first one might not be too
[1:00:35] good right cuz I'm a human
[1:00:42] being but the last one I have is thank
[1:00:46] you God for giving me a good helpmate
[1:00:48] meet part of
[1:00:51] me but most of all I thank him for
[1:00:54] salvation
[1:00:56] my kids are here my grandkids are here
[1:00:59] thank God for
[1:01:00] that I thank him for salvation am cuz
[1:01:04] that's the number one thing he told
[1:01:06] Nicodemus he said you must be born again
[1:01:08] Nicodemus said I don't understand
[1:01:11] you if you look the original up in the
[1:01:13] Greek you'll find it it say You must be
[1:01:15] born from
[1:01:17] above cuz that's where he came from
[1:01:20] that's
[1:01:21] right but he came down to where we could
[1:01:23] have what he had right amen he turn
[1:01:25] eternal life let's go come on just let's
[1:01:28] think on these
[1:01:30] things what is man that are mindful of
[1:01:33] in the Bible says are the son of man
[1:01:39] right he created
[1:01:42] us for the
[1:01:46] purpose of us to worship
[1:01:51] him but we must do as the Bible says
[1:01:54] worship Him in spirit and in truth so I
[1:01:57] want to know the truth about it don't
[1:01:59] you and then I know how to
[1:02:03] worship why because he's the god of
[1:02:06] creation he's the god of worship go
[1:02:09] ahead listen 291 291 anybody have a need
[1:02:12] the altar is open we love to pray for
[1:02:14] the sick we love to pray for salvation
[1:02:17] why because it's all in the same
[1:02:20] atonement we believe in
[1:02:23] healing we believe in Deliverance and
[1:02:25] guidance
[1:02:29] stand here and talk all afternoon about
[1:02:31] the things God has done for this old
[1:02:34] body change my blood type from a
[1:02:37] positive to a negative proven medically
[1:02:39] by the
[1:02:42] doctor which is
[1:02:44] impossible but yet he done
[1:02:49] it I have their records to prove I'm
[1:02:52] talking about a deliver a Healer a God
[1:02:54] that's real
[1:02:58] not just an imagination not a good
[1:03:01] thought that's what some people say that
[1:03:03] God is a good thought the devil's a bad
[1:03:05] thought we're just in the middle between
[1:03:07] the thoughts I
[1:03:08] guess
[1:03:11] no we are his
[1:03:16] children we have a right to cry out unto
[1:03:18] him to
[1:03:23] believe cuz he's real
[1:03:27] your
[1:03:32] you
[1:03:34] you
[1:03:36] your how
[1:03:39] long has it
[1:03:41] been you
[1:03:43] knew that
[1:03:46] he
[1:03:50] for how
[1:03:53] long has it been since you
[1:03:57] KN by your
[1:04:00] B and
[1:04:02] pray to the
