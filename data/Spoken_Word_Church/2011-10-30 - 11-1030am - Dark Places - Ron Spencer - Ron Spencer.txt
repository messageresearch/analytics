know another church or something we want you to eat with us because that's what we've done and have a good time amen though let's just sing open the eyes of our heart brother wrong sister he doesn't have to be introduced because everybody knows him we really appreciate him appreciate him coming down and brother coming to be with him and we just we've had a good time looking forward to the word and that's what we gathered for right that's right faith cometh by what hearing and hearing by the word so that's what we're based on it means so let's sing it into it open the eyes is i i am oh that's right you love the lord this morning amen how did you come to have church amen amen we've gathered and it's our turn our turn to have a worship of the lord and we certainly have a joy right enjoyed i i heard as the word was read this morning it could not have been more right on so so we know that the lord knows all things i'd like to bring you greetings from home and the church that is there and each and every one of them brother homer wanted to say hello he certainly loved you with all of his heart and so we thank you for praying for for him he had four major operations in about 40 days and and so but god has strengthened him and he's been with him and has a blood clot in his heart right now and and they're using blood thinners to try to dissolve that so if you will remember him in prayer continue to remember him in prayer that god would be with him and we watched some amazing things happen and he's still the same god brother ollie came with me and his brother terrence said what's his name and so uh brother only's with me and it was in the spring that brother holy we were working at the house and got a call that he's just been in a car wreck a car hit him right straight head-on he was in an f-150 pickup truck and it just destroyed that front end annihilated and the other young man was perished he perished in the accident actually throw his motor up 100 and so feet through a wire fence and my brother only his his foot was crushed but god has been merciful to him and so so god knows all things and there's no accidents to a child of god we can take consolation in that right and i i got the news this morning that brother roger glance it was his house that perished this morning and a fire and so if you just remember remember them amen you love the lord amen isn't he good to us amen let's pray lord jesus we love you this morning and lord we just thank you for your amazing grace that's how sweet the sound and and lord i just ask you that you'd come and anoint these lips one more time to to speak of your word a living word and lord we ask you that you would anoint this congregation lord that you see the needs that have come before us father brother roger in his home we thank you first of all that they were not they were did not perish in the fire this morning and lord we just pray that you would just be with them in the coming days and lord i i just ask you that you'd minister to every need this morning all of us have needs and lord we just pray that you would just meet us in a special way and we thank you for all your bountiful benefits on our lives in jesus christ's name amen amen amen you will turn with me to james chapter 1 this morning i trust you was blessed yesterday evening man i know when i got in bed last night i was wore out so if i could measure it by that i was i'm just gone so amen thank god for rest amen james chapter one and i would like to i would like to look at just for just a little while this morning brother sam asked me if i would give a portion of the testimony this morning so i'd like to just speak to you for just a bit and just kind of blend some of those things in james chapter 1 and verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive a crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man when he is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust is conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished bringing forth death do not air my beloved brethren psalms chapter 37 this morning you can be seated and i'll read several scriptures here psalm chapter 37 and verse 34 wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off they thou shalt see it right and i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree yet he passes away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be could not be found mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace now i like that part mark the perfect man who said brother and i'd like to meet that perfect man through the eyes of god he looks at you amen i you know it doesn't give us a license to sin or neither does it give us a license to just go make mistakes but through the eyes of god god doesn't see our mistakes i i heard a pentecostal man say one time they had great difficulty when brother brown would walk to the pulpit and say father forgive me for my sins a prophet he could see himself right like you can see yourself psalms chapter 119 verse 33 order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me deliver me from the oppression of man so will i keep thy precepts the other man says and i know my redeemer liveth he says no matter how little you are how big you are are how important you are or how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose just as my just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail is on my finger for a purpose my eye and every part of our bodies is here to serve a purpose it was not prettier just to see what it would look like than when it was put here but it was put here to serve a purpose and it's god's divine plan to do so and if we were here for a purpose then there is nothing that can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled amen are you with me nothing nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble that we have how much heartaches or sorrows that we go through all of these things are reason and there is a reason for it right amen that's exactly right sometimes when we become a christian we think well we've got it made now but brother says we're we just entered into the war we now becomes the molding process now the pressure right and oh i want the i want the character of god we'll you see god knows god knows what you what he has for you in his mind and coming through the the nature of humanity mourning sin chafing and iniquity he knows how you'll be born and so many times we say well you know i wish i was different well god knows exactly how you could be and he knew what your weaknesses were before you ever got here and he knew that it was going to take a process through to develop you right now don't you love the lord and through that process he's going to watch over here aren't you glad of that decision all right notice what brother said what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing can ever separate us from god's immortal eternal plan it must be as god has said right he said we find out that all of the world was going to be destroyed by a flood then what god what but but but by a flood that god had made a preparation a preparation for what caused to preserve his purpose he did it in the days of noah he's going to do it today he has made a preparation to conserve his own purpose he said he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will conserve subjects for his great domain that death cannot destroy that's right are you with me now yes sir and he says a point once wrote oh what foretaste of glory divine heir of salvation purchase of god born of his spirit worth of his blood what an assurance upon this solid rock the resurrection of our blessed lover the lord jesus nothing can listen what paul begins to say a man who wrote 14 books of the bible he says let no man thank me to be a fool if otherwise yet as a folk receive me that i may be boast myself a little that which i speak i speak it is it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in the confidence of boasting seeing that we have many glory after the flesh i also i glory also for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise for if you suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face i speak concerning reproach as though we have been weak how big wherever any is born i speak foolishly i'm bored also here are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more and labor is more abundant in stripes above measure in prison more frequent than that's often right of the jews five times received by 40 stripes save one that's more than just a few sentences exactly right my man can say that i've been there and done that got the t-shirt you know a lot of people say things and that they haven't went through nothing right i'm going to be i'm a christian i've got it i believe this and i believe this well let's just let life happen all right that's right enjoy the honeymoon five times i received stripes saved one the rice i was beaten with rods once i was stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a day and a night i have been in the deep in journeys often in perils of waters and perils of robbers and perils of my own countrymen and burials are they either in perils in the city and perils of the wilderness and perils of the sea imperials amongst false brethren probably that was the most dangerous right in weariness and painfulness and watchings often into hunger and thirst and fasting's often him cold and nakedness besides those things which are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak i am not weak who is offended i am not i burn up if i must need glory i will glory of the things which concern the mind infirmities right amen the god and father our lord jesus christ which is blessed forevermore he said north then i lied not notice how he says it right chapter 12 he said it is not expedient for me to doubtless to glory i will come to the visions and relations of the lord i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell where they're out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth set your one carpet into the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell going north how that he was caught up into the paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter a such a one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in my infirmities though for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lester any man should think about me above that which is sent to me to me or heareth me and lest i should get exalted above through a measure through the abundance of revelations there was to give it to me a thorn in a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should get exalted above measure for this thing i've assaulted the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for me for my strength is made perfect in weakness amen most gladly therefore i would rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ might resurrect my may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities i don't mean we're happy with it that's right yeah we're not careful we'll we'll allow our infirmities to be in a spot to where we almost worship them right that's right but god is greater than any infirmity that we will ever have the scripture says in second timothy chapter one he said god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power right and of love amen out of a sound which is a disciplined mind right right be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord not of nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god brother man says and when he swore by himself he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils and speak with new tongues they'll take up serpents or drink any deadly thing we know it's pointing mark chapter 16 or lay hands on the sick and they shall recover jesus said that he said why he he's become part of him yes sir god's on on the instance to deliver anything he'll make a way and when there's no way he makes the way and if any man believes in him he believes the same thing he has to he's a part of god he's an offspring of god amen that's it are you with me amen over the line i'm afraid i'll miss the rapture listen that's that's impossible right right that's absolutely impossible if you are eternal as jesus christ is eternal and he's the token living on the inside of you and i'm not talking about something put on something it's impossible for you and i to misdirection because the rapture is on the inside of us right he said he said he said he's the offspring of god he's the son of god or a daughter of god and it can't do nothing else because god's right with him he's just a portion of god look everything that god was was in the pillar of fire he emptied himself into the son jesus christ and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead body is that right the bible said that god g.o.d himself jehovah the mighty one the buckler the shield the redemptive thing everything he was was emptied into jesus christ are you with me now now that's not the end of the story brotherhood uses an analogy he said all that was in god he poured it into christ and all that was in christ he poured it into the church a many member oh sure we see one another we know one of them another's mistakes that's right we know one another's failures if you've been around a little while you realize that none of us have any perfect churches but we know a perfect god amen hallelujah all right that's right oh don't you love the lord listen to david as david begins to address his own situations he said wash me from uniniquity right cleanse me from my sins for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sins forever before me all right and the only reason i would like to just drop this in this morning sometimes if we're not careful we we feel like that we can live a private life during the week at a church life and we think well brother i got this covered and the devil will will cause and i don't feel like there's probably anybody here tonight living a double life but but i just want to kill that devil anyway and so and so and so what will happen if if we're not careful we'll have only church entity and we'll allow ourselves we'll allow ourselves the flexibility i can do what i won't do on the job right or and then and then the devil will come along and he's the kind of an enemy that will talk you into robbing the bank and then he'll call the amen police he's kind of an enemy that that knows your weakness and because he's been working on your forefathers and you're working on your former and listen he knows what the blend of humanity that you've got inside of you listen computers didn't happen overnight listen he knows he's watched your bloodlines as you come down and listen your fathers and your mothers they gave you all their weaknesses and it's those weaknesses that you have to overcome and that's the reason you need to do birth and the new birth cancels are you with me now cancels all of those strengths exactly and that sin nature is killed because god don't dwell he don't dwell in an unclean vessel and god don't negotiate with the enemy i'll give you your corner if you just stay over there that enemy's got to be killed and listen the pastor can preach but you've got to deal you've got to deal with your weakness this is not a negotiation session well well you know you know well i brother ronnie if you only knew that i had a filthy my god knows you don't have to tell me god already knows but if you be honest with god you be honest with god and you deal with that issue when it comes up because he is going to put you in the melting pot he's going to send you through some trials to get that out of you hallelujah he's going to allow people to talk about you to mold you amen this isn't going to the library and saying i i would like some patience here right right this isn't well i i'm going to figure out what love is all about and that's that's the way i'm going to live no when he comes on the inside of you right right glory he has every attribute of himself and if he get are you with me now and he begins to live all right glory amen all the answers we have around all of our problems is more of him that's right but the bible says that he said i'm thankful for a church universal triumphant right he said already predestinated and called and sealed to that body listen as paul says and we know that all things work together right for the good to them that love god to them who are be called according to his purpose notice it's be called according to his purpose he said for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate than he also called and whom he called oh watch me watch this forgive me he said and whom he called he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified amen all right oh hallelujah i love it when justification is when we get the revelation of that it's as though we never did it in the first place all right listen listen when the blood of jesus christ takes care of it it's as though you never did it in the first place and you tell the enemy that comes back to bombard your mind and remind you of your failures and your mistakes and as you're going along the way and you're you're having your ups and downs and your roller coaster experience come to a spot in your life say i'm not going there no more all right man that's exactly right all right exactly right that's it i told this at home there's a friend of mine called me he was a friend of my former life and he called me and he said hey i'd like to spend a little time with you today i'm in your area i'd like to spend a little time with you and so i was actually buying myself a car and so i said well i i said i've got kind of a busy day going i said but i'd love to see you we're actually purchasing a car and i will be at such a short place if you'd like to have dinner together today and so so i i told my boys i said now this fella he knows my former life he don't know this guy right yeah you don't know this guy you don't know that guy and so we met him we met him for for dinner and you know we we did our cordial greetings and all of this kind of thing and so his name was andy and i said as we begin to talk a little bit you know immediately he began to make links to a man that used to live here right yeah yeah and as he began to make links my boys didn't know that fella and as he began to go down through pikmin alley and yeah you know remember when yeah yeah and maybe those were war stories that we used to enjoy rehearsing yeah after a weekend or after a week and we would enjoy those war stories and i just kind of set kind of mom ashamed that they were even being brought up and he kind of noticed that you know it didn't have the same resounding effect anymore yeah right then he began to kind of quickly kind of you know as much as he had tried to dig the hole he was not trying to cover it up and so we did i was just sitting and we were we were having our dinner and i said uh eddie uh because i i didn't want him to feel so uncomfortable and i just allowed him to go for a little while and i said eddie uh i i guess i need to talk to you a little bit the fella that you know is dead right so i began to talk to him about the new birth right how that i repented and repented it's more than shaking a preacher's hand and it's more than just saying that now i'm going to go to church and it's turning from your ways and having an emptying out of that fella because that fella he's got to die right yeah there's a real sanctification process and there's some so some i sorry's and and some restorations that's got to take place and there's some real bulldozer down through the tin can alley that's got to take place and some real washing by the word and a real process of that right but listen that don't all just you don't stay in that face and go backwards and forwards but there's going to be a real burp that happens a real supernatural birth that happens in your life that you know that he lives right that's right and the author of the book comes and lives on the inside of you and now you become a living witnessing right and i begin to i begin to just talk to him and i begin to talk to him about that man he's dead yeah right right this looks like an image of the same house but the man that used to live here don't live here anymore that's right yeah and then i did begin to present it to him right i presented the scripture romans chapter 8. there is now therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's right now that man is gone now i told you that story because the enemy that inspired that man to come and witness to talk to me about my past comes to you every day right yeah right not in the form of an old friend right but he'll come in your memory channel right here right and he'll take you down 10k and he'll take you through this image and that image and that image but never allow it just to come through to contaminate your life but remind him over and over again it's done right all right exactly and there is no weapon that is formed against them shall prosper the squatter of the enemy cannot have you slave anymore the pardon has been signed it is taken care of right amen amen are you with me now amen he's already justified you and if he's already justified you watch notice what he says then he's also glorified what shall we say then those things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies it amen who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who make up intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl of sword as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and we're accounted as sheep for a slaughter may and all these things we are more than conquerors more than conquerors through him that love us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or prince of powers or powers or things present or things to come nor height nor death or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord amen this is the same man that said i was beaten by the jews this is the same man that said i have a shipwreck but here he comes back and he begins to say all things work together amen all right amen all right this is just part of the molding process all right listen to psalms chapter 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide in the shadow of the almighty and i will say of the lord he is my refuge in my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noiseless pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler be thou be thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flies by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that waste at that noon day a thousand shall fall at thy side ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee all right these are powerful scriptures amen amen brother i mean somebody it's for you amen when jim gardner brother brown talks about that in the book of judges shamgar was was standing there and remembered that he was a seed of abraham and when he remembered who he was the philistines that destroyed him every year when he remembered who he was he grabbed a six-foot stick and it is recorded that he killed 600 men not with one wave one at a time that's right i've said it many times the devil doesn't read god's word as well as he thinks he does if he did he would have brought more than a thousand men that's right yeah right brother how do i have why do i have so much trouble well he knows that if he don't bring a thousand a thousand demons he hasn't brought enough to attack you that's exactly right amen good morning good morning glad you woke up got out of bed made your way over here glad you went back to sleep only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even my most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall them amen neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and the outer the young men and the dragon shall thou trample under faith because he has set his love upon thee therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he have known my name hallelujah he has no mind message amen he shall call upon me and i will answer him yes sir i won't be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him right and show him my salvation amen that's a wonderful scripture brother ryan let me give you a little background about that scripture it was a man in britain he was in the british army he was a colonel and he told all of his men under him he said i want every one of you every soldier that is in your battalion i want you to read that scripture before you go to battle he told the officers he said do not let a man go to battle without reading a scripture and i want you to read it every day i wanted to cross your lips every day he fought four years in world war one and not one man was shot the battalion that fought right next to him lost 88 in one bottom not one man was shot this is a man that doesn't know anything about malachi 4-5-6 this is a man that doesn't know anything about revelations 10 7. doesn't know anything about revelations 19 but this is a man that took god at his word this is a covenant between god and man right and he took god at his covenant heavens and earth will pass away but his word will not pass away all right that's right amen yes sir exactly brother said in one instance and i'm not going to i'm not a quarter quarter exactly but brother brown says he said the devil was so big and he said just something unction on the inside of him to say move yeah and he said the more that i said move the smaller the devil all right brother dan diesel used to tell a story and you no doubt heard it over and over again about this mouse that was being chased by this cat yeah and as this mouse was being chased by this catch you know he found himself in a wine and could her girl go and he came back up and finally got out of the wine bottle and he said where's that cat if you ever realize who you are all right if you ever realize who you are right a little woman that don't hardly weigh 100 pounds soaking wet all right can go on their knees and shake the kingdom off young people that are alone in their school let me just say god does not have to fortify you with ten thousand believers around you that's right he doesn't have to crush you up and prop you up and beg you up and hamper you up and baby you around a real child of god right god can allow them to go through some tasks right and god's got confidence in them that they can go through their trials brother ron if i went through that trial i know i'd make it to uh you might want to hang on to that one god knows what he wants out of your life that's right he knows what it takes to get you where you need to go right right that's right sometimes we look at a man or we look at a woman that's sitting beside us in church and we go wow what a christian you don't know what it took to get that person there you really don't know what it took sometimes we don't appreciate the value of the results of which god hates right right sometimes we just really don't appreciate the value because there are people that show up in church on sunday morning wednesday night and they've been through some extreme difficulties just to be there right now some of us went through cancer and cancer with its terrible fear that goes along with it but let me just say no matter how deep the cancer is god is not our god is not not not going to succumb to the god of cancer cancer is not bigger than our god that's right i stood at the motel this morning and i came down early for breakfast it was just before 7. and the ladies were working there kind of feverishly getting the breakfast together and taking care of what they needed to do and this lady asked me she said are you a preacher and i said yes yes ma'am i am you know almost sometimes you got to be careful even to say that you know i said yes ma'am i am i'm here preaching for brother samuel daley and i i said we're having services this morning at services last night and she said i have a friend her name is juanita and she just got the news this week that that she has cancer and she just went to bed and depressed and and she just just kind of threw life away i said well i want you i want you to tell her that the cancer is not greater than god i want you to remind her that cancer is not greater than god cancer is a demon spirit and brother i said we don't fear cancer we don't fear cancer that the enemy would try to come along and make us miss us come to the level to wherever that we would fear when it when it just the doctor says it could cross its lips brother man said he said when the doctor tells you that you've got a disease he said you walk with god all right the scripture said whose report do we believe all right right whose report do we believe i choose to believe god's report amen god said i am your healer i am right four years ago when i was i had i had came home i'd spent the day with brother holy brother lloyd walls and some others and i don't know for sure exactly who who all i spent the day with but i spent the day with them and we've been at a car auction and on the on the on the way home you know i we had a man that had passed away in our church and i went to the wake of that evening as i as they came home it was we've been in a drought situation and we had some things to burn and so so i had a propane tank and it was kind of our i grew up in uh at home burning burning brush and burning fence froze and things like that with the propane tank and i was so used to it but on this particular evening i was using this unit i couldn't get it to light matthew showed up just just at the nick of time god knows god knows all things whitney needed grant paper and so her need for graph paper had matthew there right of all people that would have paid for matthew had graph paper and so matthew came and he saw me working with a flashlight and so he immediately come up and dad what you doing i said get ready to light this on fire and he said you know what you're doing i said we've done it hundreds of times and so we're standing there trying to get into light and unbeknownst to me that the gases had come out and they they were spread all over the place and so finally we got it to ignite and when it when it ignited it ignited all of that all right and so when it ignited i i don't remember these things thank god for that but matthew grabbed me and pulled me away with such force until it jerked his shoulder out of place and so long and short they took me to the the rescue and and the rescue began to work on me and and then then i would go into a cold blue situation there in the rescue unit and they actually had prayer for us in the rescue unit and they they knew who i was and then and then when we got to the the hospital was a man named dr kramer that was actually there dr kramer i i had known him through the past he was the man that worked on brother homer brother homer had fell out of a tree stand about 20 some feet and fell out of the tree stand and did a somersault and he had crushed his pelvis and dr kramer was the man to get him to get him to be flown to uva you know it's not safe to be around some of us guys that's right but that's a story within itself and bro homer had fell out of a couple's tree stands he finally got the revelation we were talking one day matthew and myself were talking going down the road and he said you know you know the bible says we've got angels watching over us he said i'm sure there was a conversation going on do we bring them to heaven or lord would you just leave them there to see what else they didn't do that's right and so when this goes off dr kramer i i go into a room they they termed it room 14 when i when i went into this room they took me into this room i didn't know what was going on sent me into this room and they cut my wedding band off and because my hands were swelling so quickly and when the doctor looked into my lungs he told me that all i could see was soot he said and i felt in my heart no way could i ever save this man he said we put you on life support i actually met him at an airport uh just only a few months ago and and he told me he said we were going through the security line together and he said there was no way that i ever thought you'd live yeah and so i began to testify to him he said you know your lungs were 75 burned you know it's one thing for your skin to be burned right but the inside of my mouth the tongue the top of my mouth my lips my face my hands my arms were reconstructed and so my lungs were burned and i would get vre pneumonia on top of all of that and you begin to pray and i believe that is why it's so important that we pray one for another american american for the effectual prayer of a righteous man of development oh we come to the message and you know we we we get the intellect of the message and we've got our books and we've got our computer and we've got our internet we've got all that but god's not going to rapture those things right amen he's going to rapture human vessels human vessels that are the final voice to the final age and when we talk about what brother ben uses a term if given time they'd write a book of acts behind it that's right i'm sure in this building there are phenomenal testimonies phenomenal testimonies of the children of god that has went through devastating situations devastating horrible things that you've went through but god has allowed you as a testimony he's allowed you as a testimony to overcome right all right notice when it says to in revelations 3 to him that overcometh right and we're quick to say i want to be an overcomer but to to be allowed to live through some real trials and some real temptations right right nobody nobody prays to be burned up right exactly and i'm really thrilled to be on this end of the fire all right amen i was with brother tim the other day he was at my home i said brother tim through that window i said in a wheelchair and he said these roses are beautiful brother ron i said through that window i sit in a wheelchair with my hands bandaged up sister connie would after i came home sister connie would spend two hours every morning first of all i took four oxycontins for morning so i could just stand the pain so i wouldn't send my body into shock and she would scrape my skin thank god for a good wife you know sometimes young people when you stand at the altar you're standing there in that beautiful dress or that tuxedo or however however you're sitting in a taxi cab somewhere another didn't marry and believe it or not i have a preacher friend that was sitting there you know sometimes we say for better for worse right we don't know what we just said right we really don't know what we just said right because life is real right god is real life is real right you know we're looking at one another and we're all right we may have a good job or we may have good education and we begin to begin to go out and start life and a lot of times we want to be at the top of the tree we want to be at the top of the level and have everything our parents have but there's a process you got to go through you know you know there's a process of peanut butter and jelly process i don't have everything my parents said i i like that suit material where i like to have one of them why you don't know what it took to get that suit sometimes we think that everything's just magic it ain't magic sometimes there's some real difficult hours where you're praying god help me just to get fueled just i can get to work i never forget when i was a boy we were just married i don't have all this fixed in front of me so i'm just gonna i'll never forget we were i worked at an arsenal where i made nitroglycerin we think about that now god has a sense of humor my grandmother got saved the same night that i did she gave her heart with the lord she was a tough old girl real girl she was a tough old girl i didn't have fuel money to get to work and so i asked her because i i'm the kind of fella i don't i don't i don't i don't i've never asked anybody for anything come on brother so it took great humility to say hey do you have five dollars to where i can get to work and it was during a season to wear that she had no cash whatsoever on her none and i noticed the incredible shame in her face i'd like to be able to help you she went on her knees and she said god i i have need and she went into her pocketbook an old pocketbook that she had cleaned out and there was twenty dollar bill laying in there you know sometimes we take those those things and we allow them to just slip by yeah but they were incredible right not sure in that moment god just didn't say abraham take thy child there were many trials that he went through in his perfecting process to get him to work he could handle that drive right right god has allowed me to go through trials and i'm glad i'm patched falling off of the house 40 feet and landing on concrete and the doctor looking at me and said you'll never walk again was a difficult a difficult process right yeah but now no matter the situation i can look at a young man i can look at a young man sitting in a wheelchair and say god it's greater than i i shared this with brother sam yesterday i went hunting in edmonton and there was a young man that kind of guided me through my trip there he was about 20 year old boy he was in an accident with his sisters and it was a bad accident next broken this young man's brain was separated from his spinal cord and all he could move was his eyes it was about six months in the process it was a ice storm hit brother eugene braun took me there people around the world maybe even you were praying i saw it with my own eyes nurse told him told me he said this is his home this is where he'd probably be i walked in and i i looked down at nathanael and my heart was gripped i mean grip just one thing to hear the story it's another thing to see it right my heart was gripped you're late a young man that just just only a couple years before had i've been i've been hunting with and i enjoyed his fellowship as a young man you just he was a quiet fella very shy fella i just enjoyed it just kind of have an atmosphere around just enjoy it and of course when you're hunting you can enjoy a lot of things he laid in this situation just his eyes couldn't control his eyelids he couldn't control anything in his body they were functioning for him but you knew he was home right you knew he was in there i began to just talk to him we prayed with him and as i as i just spoke to him i believe you'll guide me hunting again amen i watched it he just didn't roll out of bed and say here we go it was an incredible process the next year when they preached it brother harold's there he sat in a fully functional wheelchair moving him about the next year when i went back he was on a walker and he was struggling about it seemed like it seemed like some time after that i was there and he he was he had braces on his legs and on his arms and he was functioning around him had a thing that talked through his through his mouth but today he operates a farm tractor let me just say this to you you put your faith in god and regardless of your circumstances regardless of where you're at in your life you walk into the vision listen we're not trusting the arm of flesh right listen there are times that you'll never hear our voices as ministers but god's still in control of the entire situation right right there's no piano to be heard there's no drums to be played in your ears hallelujah and all the emotion of the meeting is gone right now he's still there all right when i was sitting in that wheelchair looking at those roses an enemy would tell me you'll never preach again lungs burn that bad it was hard to just get out of bed yeah and go about daily walk right it was difficult to stand in the pulpit to just try to speak and i i i would progressively get better biscuit called sister connie and it was very early in the morning when he called sister connie and began to talk to her and he told her we've we have purchased mount baker bible way camp and he said god has laid on my heart we've heard about the accident we're praying for you and i want to share you this with you god has laid on my heart that brother ron will be the speaker next year in our convention amen what brother ed didn't know on the other end of the line as is that i had a vre pneumonia and that very night the doctor had actually came in and prayed with me saying that he had done all that he could do and now it was in the hands of god he had pronounced this to my wife there's very little hope the machine is on 100 and that very day a hollywood movie star had aspirated from the same from a condition of his stomach and it went into his lungs and burned his lungs and that night i aspirated on those burned lungs already 75 percent burn and now stomach fluid is poured in on them but there's nothing impossible to do exactly that's right and sister connie seeing what she was saying remembered those words a man of god has just called me right sure and said brother on we'll be speaking in the convention next year it wasn't what she was looking at it was what god was looking at god doesn't twist his hands and you know god never has a crisis meeting are you with me it's never out of control in your life when your world is spinning and you feel like you're in the middle of a tornado or in a storm in your life god is in complete control all right i don't care where it's financial matters i don't care where it's where it's at where it's home matters to where there's personalities involved and children matters god is greater than every problem right amen are you with me listen there's not a situation that god is not greater than right right amen yes sir exactly heaven hallelujah brother ron rhonda i've been in some dark places in my life god's had children in dark places that's right we read about three hebrew children right yeah and listen listen you and i would not know anything about none of them right but at their trial that god allowed them to go through it right that's it when they went through it god met him in their conditions all right what daniel went into a lion's den right god made him there right now i tried he was right yes sir the sam asked me yesterday about that question you heard him talk about it last night listen to me god did me a favor right right why no i hadn't sinned sure i made mistakes a long life way thought thoughts that i shouldn't think maybe send words out of attitude i shouldn't say but i'm sure i'm not sitting among angels bless you but god knew these trials were coming right oh yeah he provided me a scripture yeah though i walked through the valley of shadow of death i'll fear no evil for god with me i was in a medicaid coma for three weeks and there was one day that i woke up just enough to be able to see my wife standing outside the door everything in me would have liked to been able to tell her how much i loved her it's a very difficult hour there was a state of being no brainwave activity after i woke up right 36 hours the general rule of consensus is four or five and ours they begin to talk about organ donation the nurse told me said you're very fortunate young man you you woke up said i'm sure that there was they were they were dealing with organ donations and you you had signed your card to be an organ donor i got my card changed you you look back and you say well brother ron why it's not for me to ask god that's exactly exactly right it's not my my situation to ask why exactly it's just for thank god that you were with me lord that's right the bible says tells us in the scripture hundreds of times fear not but it's right in the midst of our obstacle of life that we fear will grip us right in the middle of our trouble we'll get all excited and try to do something about the situation that we're in in our humanity right but you must remember an enemy that comes to try you and tries to tempt you is trying to pull you into his realm to fight right right but we're the faces we're to operate in a completely different level right right a level of spoken word right and the bible says that your body will obey your confession and when you begin to conflate are you with me just now if you have to spend a few more minutes with me when you begin to confront not with your eyes and not with your ears what you're hearing right but when you confess the word of god and this message right more than just an intellectual message but when you begin to confess it he's my healer right he's my wayman regardless of what the circumstances are listen jesus operated in a realm of perfect faith perfect faith has no circumstances it's not looking to the symptoms and the situations that are around you let's look into a perfect god right that's right listen job said though god slay me you don't trust him amen that's right are you with me now all right god slay me you don't trust him when i was in business many years ago there were dry times just like all other companies that would go through dry times and it was i always told everybody around me we were so busy we were covered up knowing the phone wasn't ringing right right we were so busy we were not we were covered up yeah fine would hear that sometimes and almost chuckle but there came a time that we were a year in advance busy right yeah and when you're a chimney sweeper you're in advance busy it's a pretty good deal right are you with me now right why because we confessed in a great big god right and i believe it's more than just about your your activities of your day but i believe in our walk with god this is when we begin to believe that we're in the greatest revival we've ever been right right right that's right and we come to church with an expectation right god is going to come to my view today all right but you get what you're expecting and so many times we're expecting the minister to have all of these holidays keys crossed in his eyes dotted we're expecting him to to be be a revival for us but when we come in an attitude i am you looked every attitude in the eye and you've looked at demons in the eye and said hold on oh boy right yeah as for me in my house we're going to serve the lord and you throw every excuse right you throw every excuse away and say i'm going to serve god all right i know you're just like everybody else you're busy busyness is one of the worst enemies there is i find that retired people are the most busy people in the world right how in the world world did you go to work 40 hours a week how did you do it right people that are 75 years old are booked for weeks at a time i got one of the deacons in church brother bill and i'll call him what are you doing and he'll give me a wick itinerary yeah their young people don't have that kind of identity but we're not careful satan will so book us up in a spot right we're in a spot sometimes we come almost into a backslidden condition right right amen exactly exactly right what he's trying to do is break with the fellowship of god other brown talks about a little woman she had 17 children one of them was john wesley but she could find the time three hours a day to pray that's right yeah you go back and read history her husband wasn't a great big help that's right her husband was was an absentee father but she just didn't throw it in the way and say well here we are i'm going to have to live with what i've got she became known as the mother of methodists right because she was a praying woman when you find yourself in the circumstances of life and you find that things have been brought to you in a certain way hey listen don't just throw up your hands and say right well it ain't gonna get no better let me just say this to you take your position in christ that's right amen right yes sir oh brother ron but i'm just a young person in school you can be an overcomer right in that situation all right how many young people that i've dealt with that's the only young person in the entire school yeah right but they've led many to the lord right yeah are you with me now they've led many to the lord sitting there in our church is six former cheerleaders and i watched them one by one as they came in and and i was thinking in my natural mind they'll never make it but today you could never pick them out of the rest of the system all right all right all right hey man are you with me listen our job is to be a witness just let it come in and let it fill your life and your way amen until it's more than a quote book it's more than a book on it not a shelf it's more than tape it's more than your pastor's sermon but it's a life right all right i was i was sharing this morning with brother wade so many times the enemy will deal war with us and he'll tell us you know you know don't pay your tithes but he'll take his children yeah and they'll pay more tithes than you'll pay they'll stand in the counter and give five dollars for a pack of cigarettes yeah right they won't hardly have money to buy their food but they'll they'll buy their beer they're buying their drugs right right they'll do their things in the world and they'll spend their moneys on their entertainment right for the devil's tights are you with me just now knowing the smoking's going to destroy your lungs knowing the alcohol's going and he don't tell you that part right right the drugs are going to destroy your liver it's going to destroy your brain cells right but he don't show you that part i was talking to brother zach last night i was talking about matthew when he was playing football you know and you know you know sometimes if we're not careful we'll we'll allow ourselves to the enemy will open the opportunity and we'll go to the what if category being a pro ball player all they can have prolific careers but at the end of it they're something in a wheelchair sometimes we think of what god saved us from but it's incredible what he kept us from glory amen where would we be at today had not god came into our lives right many of us would be dead right many of us would be homeless are you with me just now oh maybe maybe many of you would have been church members in a church somewhere another blinded thinking you were right amen and just church entity no transformation right right right going to church professing one thing living or nothing can i just share just a couple more things he said listen faith is unconscious right he's have learned that in years of travel around the world meeting people's in all different walks he said faith is unconscious he said you've got faith and you don't even know it right he said jesus christ no matter if he was in the store miguel's knocking the boat from one side to another or standing in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging and he said he was hanging everywhere he said it never moved him he walked right on just as common as required as it could be he was simply unconscious of fear anything around me whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god said so oh wonder if i prayed enough wonder if i fasted long enough i wonder if i did this he simply walked right on unconscious that's right he believed that what god said was the truth the words must be fulfilled he knowed what his life was before him that's right and he said you're here to fulfill it too amen amen not just your pastor not just myself but you're here all right gloria you're here to fulfill god's purpose amen he said just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left hand just keep moving on right right exactly if something comes up in your in the church walk with god this sickness strikes you walk with god all right hallelujah what the all right all right all right i've got blood pressure i've got cancer i've got this i've got that let me just say god's greater than all of that don't let it consume your mind 24 hours a day i've got it right just believe god he's greater than that hallelujah amen listen sickness will overwhelm you to the spot to where it just could literally paralyze your face a sister that was in the nursing home and she had a she had a horrible she had an absolutely horrible stroke she told me one day she said i am here to show this entire nursing home jesus christ listen she couldn't get up she laid in that bed and listen at her funeral the doctors were there the nurses were their patients were there all right all right hey man all right oh that's just one brother on okay brother homer's brother was debilitated he couldn't even talk plain listen there were people that came in to see him from everywhere he was the greatest politician there ever has been bill clinton don't know nothing the day he passed away i was in a john deere i was later that day i was in a john deere uh dealership and there was a man walked up and shook my hand he said did you know melvin fraser i said yeah i did he said he passed away i said don't you know him he said i went to see him every week how'd you know he said i just became a friend of him he's a real christian regardless of your circumstances amen regardless of your situation he said he knocked walkers one day walk like that you know what he did he walked all the way home right i made sure it is amen he said it got so far up the road that it didn't come back he walked with god glory did you walk with blood the doctor says you're going to what going to die what with god the doctor says you can't get well walk with god just walk with god that's all he said for god has promised i'll never leave you i'll be with you to the end of the world right he took an oath of a covenant with you right he gave it to you and he confirmed it just walk with him hey this is simple but look loose i says it you're going to have your ups and downs right but don't you wear it right you've got to go through some briar patches and over some sharp rocks over some bluffs and down some hillsides up and down some mountains and over the waters walk was god amen that's right that's right oh yeah he said there's so many hills to climb upward you've heard that soul whole song but but how little it'll sing when you get to the end of the way right that's right walk with god amen amen i'm finished with this enoch found himself in a cave or elijah found himself in a cave i'm going to be like brother brown we have an enoch on the flood i knew when you said yep elijah found himself in a cave imagine what an anointing it was yeah when all those prophets were killed then the fire came that day yeah but one woman the voice of one woman had him on the back side of the desert crying all right crying before god let me die like your fathers yeah now listen if he really wanted to die he'd just found jezebel right she took care of that prophet peter really wanted to die he found jezebel yeah exactly he was having a pity party it was john god how bad it was god knew sure brother brown said god searched through heaven and said i want to find the angels with the softest hands find the angel with the softest hands come and rub his brow god knows how to give a real massage i want to find the best cook in heaven he looked all through georgia it looked all through virginia i believe he found him there but yeah may have been in georgia all right i'll see you after dinner all right and he had the best cook and that angel came and baked him some cakes that's right baked him some cakes and and he arrested god knows how to take care of you all right he doesn't have to take care of you so we're rolling around i'm so alone no you know he's got angels that are watching over you and you're better protected than the president of the united states you see those protectors are reactors yes they're reactors they're kind of watching out everything and they're but they react to pressure they react to crowds they react to this right but the angels that you're you've got around you knows what's coming when you're driving down the road only inches from death they know how to take care of you and many times testimony is like what we have been through we really don't know nothing of what he kept us from right that's right right that's exactly and in my life that's a big deal i listen it was just a normal day it was a nice day little clouds in the sky i'm weed eating got my ear muffs on i'm doing all the safety things eye glasses on i got my ear things on and i'm winging i didn't know it's a thunderstorm anywhere in the area they plugged in all that we did are you with me it's what you're doing right in the midst of your trial glory to help somebody else let's bow our head this morning lord jesus we love you this morning we have reported for duty one more time philly led as brother sam calling even before he would ask amen you had led me to go this direction because god will have a testimony amen he will have people that that will have lived the book of acts in this day that's right amen all right we could talk about the woman that was in memphis that had a little boy dying we could talk a little about the little mexican baby that the woman brought that was dead and the doctor told her to go bury her baby but what about the testimonies that said in this building that sit here tonight right that many circumstances come to their lives and you held them through that lord jesus i just asked you that as we remind even ourselves of these things that have happened lord we weren't the great one it was you we wasn't the important one it was you father lord jesus and we just thank you father that you watch over us that you are our

young people sitting here today lord that maybe they don't know you in the fullness of what they should well i pray that you deal with their lives lord let them know that not to bypass their youth but to serve god with everything that is within them oh maybe they'd make some choices and and think though that everything is just so wonderful the way that they chose and then there begins to become some difficult days lord let them know that your grace is sufficient mercy can rewrite their lives lord jesus i pray that you'd speak to every one of our hearts this morning this is a service that we would say thank you thank you for being there thank you for being there lord i wouldn't even want to drive home this afternoon without you being there i wouldn't want to walk across the street without you being there right when we get up in the morning we arm ourselves for battle and we put on the armor of the lord and we bow our heads and pray the kingdom of hell shakes when we begin to read god's eternal word and it flows across our lips and we as we read it lord it's more than a a text right but it's a living reality help our churches to be stronger father help our families to be stronger
