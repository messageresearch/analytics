«  E-21       †        I believe as... Perhaps all the ministers, or many of them, knows that this setting meant the coming--the order of the coming of Christ. The first thing they seen, and how the order was, they seen Jesus, which was to appear, and then they seen the coming of the glorification, and Moses, and Elijah, the very order of the second coming. Then when they looked back, they saw Jesus only, when they looked again.
    Now, we find that He taken them up there for a purpose. And He took three. In the Old Testament, also, the New, three is a confirmation. "In the mouth of two or three witnesses, let every word be established." That's in the Old, and both in the New Testament. And we notice that Jesus taken with Him, Peter, James, and John: three earthly witnesses to bear record. And God had on the mountain: Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, for a heavenly witness. God's fixing to do something great.

5) «  62-1       †        PATMOS.VISION  -  CHURCH.AGE.BOOK  CPT.2
Now in Matthew 16:28, prefacing Matthew 17:1-13, Jesus had said,
 "... There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
    And the three apostles did see just that--the order of His second coming. They saw Him transfigured there on the mountain top. His raiment was blazing white and His face shone like the sun at its zenith. And there as He appeared, stood Moses and Elijah on either side. That is exactly how He is coming again. Truly Elijah will first come and turn the hearts of the children (bride) back to the fathers' Apostolic Word Doctrine.
    Malachi 4:5,6,
 "Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."

well thank you lord we're just proud to the point that you're on our side and leading us into whatever you have to be for us this day Lord opened on eyes or the word from our eyes that I word that Diane eyes may Lord look down upon us and not have to look on us as being wrong in life and things but look at us as your offspring and your children and that you would Lord take care of us and guide us have your way as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and Lord most of all forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness thank you for being with each one touching the sick among us and delivering and we expect you to continue to do that we love you in Jesus name Amen and we read this sunday but we want to continue on with our thought from Sunday and just make it like a part two of the resurrection so we'll read I read the entire chapter of mark 16 so let's just read it again and think about the things that it's saying goes now listen it this mark 16 shows all the way from the resurrection you know showing the resurrection the thing shows up through and showing how that he appears to him and show right up to the place that he is taken up into the skies and shows all the way down through the ages and coming down to where we are in the end time picking up from this one scripture so just think on these things and when the Sabbath was faced mary magdalene and mary mother of James and saw me had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into this up with you at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the surface here and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great in other words they knew something had to happen right it was rolled away and entering into the something to he saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were a Friday they're afraid right and he said unto them be not afraid be not afraid you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he caught before you into Galilee now remember the announcement he is risen proof he goes before them right all right into Galilee and Dyer you shall see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the shop richer for that trouble they were troubled for they troubled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom had got seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not what about personal witnesses what about even after they're seeing him you know after the resurrection and they're still doubting over the book of Acts you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time see even after seeing even walking with him all right now watch it goes from the morning now here's props to the evening after that appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them afterward he appeared into the 11 as I said it meet and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen now watch you now it jumps all the way to his ascension because if you'll take this put it in Matthew in them you'll see that this part when he gives this statement to them actually falls right at his ascension and going up into the acts of the book of Acts because like look what he said he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sit on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached ever were the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following them you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we tried to bring up just a simple point son desire because we had a lot of company in and thanks and keeping it down to just do resurrection and everything and then Wade comes along in the afternoon he doesn't know what I'm going to preach on I don't know I don't know what he's going to preach on but he comes right in and picks up the point and curves it on in to a good understanding will overlap that in a minute and to just move right on through it to where we can see it and you know I pray that you will we're listening now as I said his resurrection would have been early in the morning and then the whole day price's and he appears to the two on the road to Emmaus all right then we see to that even as he gets here in the commandments he give read all your Gospels together and you'll start moving to ward and then you'll see them as the two angels no standing by when he really said why are you looking to heaven for like Wade was all about looking for him up dire well he's not going to be up there the resurrection that he done the reason for him to raise would be that he's going to come back and live within you all right and we know that took place because then that way we can see that that it's been a wonderful thing down through the ages of all the time knowing that we all have had an experience of the resurrection all going again believers of the Resurrection inside of the other you know it's not just looking for a resurrection with the resurrection and within us all right now in doing that then it would bring the resurrection to a present tense point as I said we always read that and and man will read it in his mind he reads he is risen but in his mind he's reading he has risen or he was risen or maybe he raised or something like that his mind is not reading them point of this picture but the scripture said he is risen which would mean ever present that is comes to a point that it's saying okay that's here now so ever born again believer now down through the Bible ever born again believer would have that experience you know coming down from Calvary coming through into the New Testament with how the experience of the newburgh which would be the very resurrection inside of us and the Prophet said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is all right now it's been the resurrection the whole time all right and that's why I asked you to question sunday or me and all of us you know what does that resurrection mean to each one of us you know what is it to you and I the resurrection well we just believe it sometimes distance that's going to happen like this but if the Prophet is right anyone I believe it is I just said that way for you to think about it then he said the resurrection was inside of you well then why are we looking for somewhere else for a resurrection when I looked into our own experience talking to some people today get my hair cut and they were talking about the Bible its end I told him I said I said I've never tried to read the Bible to memorize it in the brothers are mean the man that I've known him a long time and I'm furious in here he said I've read I know the old testament 20-something times well that's glory I mean that's good i'm wonderful but I said I've never tried to read the Bible to memorize it I read it to try to see what it's saying to me I said but most people read the Bible to see what it's saying about somebody else you know looking at in about somebody else and even in the best that can do it look at it were like oh but we can't be Paul you know now and all we just you know we just can't be that away well if it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but then could it be that Paul might one swap places with you but his our down to this hour goes but a random shows us out where you say well now he didn't you just got pudding he said if I'd had the choice I would have took this hour one because it's finishing all things up all right but it's coming to a resurrection and the proof of his resurrection has been down through the church ages that the people would recognize that when he would say I'll be with you always even to the end of the world or hallway you know that he would be living in each one of us and it would not be that we would be like them and I emphasize the point that the Bible said he was seen a 500 brethren after his resurrection we know 380 of much not much up odors only 120 in the upper room well could it be possible to really see God could it be possible to do that to really see him you know you said well he wasn't born again I'll agree with you they didn't have an inside teacher you know until Calvary and then the day of Pentecost alright but looks like somebody would have begin to believe it you know I mean you know we used to tell off on doubting Thomas but there's one thing about it when he did get to do what he said he'd like to do he said Lord forgive me no he believed it it has the resurrection does it mean anything to you because we always try to make the emphasis of what not trying to come to a rapture because we know that the resurrection must come before the rapture that's simple stretch your right Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout board our kind of trouble gone then the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain all right a simple scripture explaining that that's what's going to take place well I wonder did it mean this or will do the top of this for that see that's the way we get into all of those things by the reasoning of a mankind to try to figure them out and it's like I said I never read the Bible I never have I don't read it now I don't read beretta rounds message I don't listen to take some time to try to figure out now listen I'm not doing it to even try to figure out what he's saying or what the Bible's saying I'm wanting to know what he said by experience so you can holler Hebrews 13 80 you want to and not believe he's the same because the property said if he's not the same in every way except the Corporal body he said then you're an interception of sight well she's in the resurrection is a very valuable thing to each and every one of us but he didn't leave us with just say y'all oh how is it the Prophet said he didn't leave us with just a point of a Bible to read or a thoughts or ideas he come to live in us not to just give us a book to read that's wonderful but then he turned around the prophet and say after all the emphasis he put up on the Bible he turned around sick as long as it's laying here on these pages what do you say it can be questioned well I tell you what now I don't question it oh you hear that a lot don't you no I don't question it now I believe it well that's what I mean I'm not trying to figure out what the Prophet is taught us I don't study for a sermon to try to figure out something and I could find that somebody else hasn't talked you know that's not dark it's to see what he wants me to say what part that I've got to do with it that's the way we should read the Bible or listen to the message that way no that way then you won't be in a situation of the scent or they found 24 more tapes we need to get every one of them well praise God we do we need to get everyone listen to them 10 times the face a man what is it looking for something that's secretly hidden or is it looking for the resurrection of Jesus Christ because the Bible said it if he raised we praise also waivers bringing that up Sunday right through the message with enjoyed it those are sitting her life in saying well I got a priest windy so I wonder how far he's going I wonder what quotes he's going to use well they was already I didn't redo the quotes and not do you noticed that it was already tired in the lineup and the quotes for youth coming from Sunday but you know i'm not i'm looking to try to see what god is speaking to you that's what the resurrection has to do with me not just looking to the man raised but looking that that man has raised and lives inside of you and I look at how he lived and worried live and what he's doing and how there's been him all the way down to his are coming forth in each age bringing forth himself and really the resurrection is what the revealed Word is that true the resurrection is the reveal word because if it's not revealed that's what I've tried to preach to you when Martin Luther see something raised in that man something happened like we're talking want to go about a revelation from God you know God speaking to you in Revelation don't that make you feel just about that big don't you make it feel like Brett around said crawl under a ten-gallon hat for the thing that a god of glory no matter what you think you're God is butta into whatever is if he would come down and talk to you there'd be a wonderful time later that's what he's trying to do he's trying to reveal his word to us what other talking do we won't but then him reveal something to you that you've always wondered about good wonder what wanted to say that and you tried to figure it out by rereading going over it and studying it and everything and reading what other people how to say about it and all kind of things but then one day God just opens the door and you just see something you know my wife I remember years ago because remember in the the prophet in the statue of a perfect man see why didn't he read some of these scriptures over here he said it looked like he would read them here and then it would have been on I said Bonnie wouldn't meant to be that way it was meant to be that way he was meant for him to read what ever had because that was to bring it for it and that's where we learned it from sure we get everything we get by way of the Prophet but can't you see that you're in the red you know you're already in the resurrection by the resurrection being in you right you're already in the rapture by the Holy Ghost being within you there's no way to stop it from taking place I don't care where you die don't care what happens there's no way to stop that resurrection and there's no way to stop the rapture and like I've always said when he gave you the Holy Ghost right then he laid claim on that body that you're living in you're not going to get a new body because you wouldn't think one it's this body to be redeemed all right now we're going one way or the other to that position if we die and go by the grave then we're resurrect in Greece that position but if we don't we're going to stay here and then they're going to raise and then we're going to join them in a resurrection all right to believe in and he's the same yesterday today and forever is to see what's happening in your day not to go back and it's wonderful go back and read about another day and what happened in this mood in Calvin and knocks and penny I love to read though read about brother branham and his experiences and done it's thrilling to us write what you know that won't change you at all and will challenge you it's got to be something personal alright so the resurrection is not just a raising up of a body just remember Luther had his resurrection within him when he went down are you following me his resurrection was in him he's not going to be somebody preach something for a resurrection within him his resurrection was inside of him well why can't you believe it's inside of you till then I'm take away the fear of death it'll take it to a place that will see what's taking place i wrote it like this i said do you see what I'm talking about then I wrote now this is what I had left over and I wrote what I said do you see what I'm talking about you see it said what that he's the same in every age in the people he's always the same and he changed in has the resurrection inside of them right all right now it says that he has risen all right we've covered that part that was what we're talking about sunday he is risen but what about jumping 2,000 years and reading again that he has risen and to find it says he has risen again I haven't left the point i told you i would just take this junk messages here backwards and forth and preach on but I will follow you I wouldn't lower myself to sleep to think that I've left the topic very much I'm still driving my best to try to get you to see who you are and what's taking place in your life and that'll be the rest of it don't matter anymore I preacher or dont preach but what about now it says he is risen now that's been enough to hold mankind right that's been enough to hold the ages in mankind in a position to work that something could take place and it would have to take place in the life stage all right now they said we read to mark and we've seen where it come down and how did it comes to a place alright a place was spoken up back there that would take place in this end time all right now can we find that in time in the scriptures and talk about it you know what we just believe it well yeah that might be all right but don't put me on the roads yet our plane to fly me across the country or something that you just believe might work okay I'm not going I'll just stay where I'm at I ain't gonna get on the plane we that you think you can fly or you think it'll work I want something sewer right I want something tried and see that's why it is that the flight and our plane is the safest thing there is a lot safer than an automobile come on out of all of the bomb blowed up and blow 2 planes apart you take all of that off and you got down to a small amount of desk from planes of normal things that take place you know well what are you getting at well you know it was spoken of dire in the scriptures as we read that he has risen and then you move over into the writings in the scriptures after about somewhere in the neighborhood of three years of Jesus's ministry and he comes to another place and it says again a very outstanding thing to us right let's go to Matthew 17 let's just read it let's start think about this of what this day an hour that we're living looks it after six days Jesus taking Peter James and John they would bring them up into a high mountain apart you know what a story of three heavenly witnesses three earthly witnesses we know the whole story right and was transfigured before them are transformed if you look it up and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was white as wool what is a lot and behold our period until him Moses and the lies talking with him the answer Peter and said unto Him Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here the make three type of nikon 1 could be one for moes 14 light us that's as well common things while he had spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I well pleased here you him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face was so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save users only and they came down for the mountain Jesus charged in saying tell the vision to know man what until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead he said well they just messed up by the wording there you know it should have been saying that Jesus would raise he said it specifically he said there's something that you went through and he called it a vision and he said now you go back down remember this was also before they had the newburgh right this was also before they had received Christ into their soul and heart but yet they understood something marvelous had taken place and they said he said don't television what vision what was the vision the vision was that they saw Jesus they saw Moses and they saw lies which is Elijah huh but that's where I emphasized when I said it you know it was transfigured look it up he was transformed right before them he was transformed the Prophet would call it into a glorified condition what about a vision that would cover these things what about a vision and watch a vision that has never been known until this time they were told to not tell the vision now you know yourself the mark wasn't Derek or we know that for riding you coming over the other the Matthew was dire all right but you know yourself even after he received the new work even after Peter would call it the holy mountain you remember that the scripture when he referred back to mount Transfiguration he called it the holy mountain and tall of the things that he had seen while they were dire but how much difference was it in it if you have a vision and don't get the interpretation of the vision right remember a vision a dream loans of dreams interpreted division okay where we're with it a king one time had a dream they didn't do the dream and he told a dream but he didn't know what to dream was right so now Jesus is literally telling them don't tell this vision to no one I'm not going off on the Lord and his ways of doing that just remember they couldn't understand the vision that's the point they go tell somebody they say you know what we thought we was up there we saw a vision they don't you think they went and cold what happened over and over and over throughout their times and their journey am i right would you if you have been Peter or if you have been James or John Matthew remembers writing about these others but what if you were Peter James or John that act literally would dire you mean they never said another word no we can't talk about that I think they went home probably told her the South was about it wouldn't you told what happened they said what happened then we don't know listen as the King saw the seven you know fat cows and then he saw seven skinny cows he just didn't know what you meant but he could tell exactly what the vision was right so could Peter them and so they probably did but there was something that couldn't tell what was that what the vision was about they couldn't tell what the vision was pertaining to so what did he say go talk about it go discuss it go all into we said just remember L division to know man until the Son of Man be risen again we know at that time he hadn't raised the first time right well I right this is for the resurrection of death and do it right he hadn't even raised the first time why would it say until the Son of Man be risen again these are sea vision interpretation right now we know that in that speaking dire that it brought him to a position we know that in Matthew on the River Jordan many things happened and they told it they wrote it they talked about it all right true and a boy spoke from heaven said this is my beloved son there's talk there in Matthew no Matthew three it stopped it would declare this is my beloved son just as it would declare in Matthew 17 but he said this is my son whom I'm pleased to dwell so we know immediately it's going to talk about adoption and remember adoption was one of the mysteries that it would have to wait until the end time for a profit to come to bring that understanding sure they could talk about it but that's what I just got to say and laying the point down truly Peter James and John came back telling the disciples about what happened after this experience which they didn't know what it meant now one of the reasons they didn't know what it meant is because it's in a two-fold meaning he's in a two-fold meaning of this Mount of Transfiguration experience now remember right point mark covers to the point of the resurrection he covers the Ascension he covers the preaching of the gospel through the two thousand years because he said and he went forth with signs following but there's two things to be involved to get the right understanding now what is it cover all right we know the prophets message so we say we have the interpretation all right I'll agree with you now we have what the Prophet had decided I asked to do we have it by revelation but still we've got it at least by intellect all right now will read in a minute where brother branham said and we all knew that the denominations knew that they knew that when you covering the transfiguration and the moses analyze even though they couldn't get it figure out with you water or whatever they knew that it was speaking of his second coming because what is going to be the finish of the second coming of jesus christ it's going to be through moses and elijah run the two witnesses to Israel there's your second coming of Jesus Christ to Israel primax is in his physical second coming to Israel in the Millennium which he will come back literally so then you see that the Scriptures has got to be something about it because jesus said don't tell his vision of no man don't try to figure it out leave it alone until the Son of Man be risen again when he was he going to raise again to Israel the resurrection of the word of God alive word going to Israel through two witnesses will be the second coming of Jesus Christ to Israel brightly as I said will climax in the Millennium as a personal play and their words a physical Lord Jesus Christ son of man standing on earth in the Millennium declaring himself to his realism son David of course he'll be son of god son dimensional data right all right you didn't speak civilly Second Coming that's what I said Wade picked up part I'm just trying to bring it a little different way to think about it all right they said in other words that we're thinking it and brother Brennan in other words i'm picking up your talks you can say he said I know these brothers sitting here said we know this litter listen really pertains to the second coming so that's the second coming to Israel is when we get out of here through two witnesses they'll take the word of God this message which is into our Bible take it to Israel and they'll tell Israel according to about the last part of the seal book Seventh Seal a thing did L tell them you missed your opportunity it was for you and you turned it down you are now in the tribulation and will give your life because you turn down in other words there's no way for you to fully understand this vision that I showed you there's no way they could follow it go see it had another meaning they will have to fall in now it would be the meaning of the second coming of Jesus Christ and listened to these two stages to the bride and in the bride and many comings do we how he come first to redeem his bride he came next to reveal himself in the last days I'm paraphrasing it with the words of the Prophet but then he will come and in physical coming to his bride the second coming to his right the first coming was to make the pies our brain device the redemptive plan Israel won't catch that why because the vision is sealed to them the true is that simple terminology they can't see the vision so it doesn't matter if you tell it you could put it in book phone you go to Israel spread it out before them would it do any good brother Peregrine done a real good job of going to Israel and taking this message and putting it on the internet and our waves and etc but did it convert them know why because the vision is still sealed am i right because what did he say in Daniel the part way was picking up what seal division is that one of the six whole purpose the seal division all right they still feel to Israel the Bible says that they cannot see said because their hearts I'm paraphrasing Paul he said because their hearts are not turned he said but when that heart turns when that heart turns to them which would be God giving them eternal life after we get out of here it's going to open up and they're going to see the vision but what does that have to do to you and I do you understand we know the vision what was the vision they were sealed up why would Moses in the last dark who sealed up see they never saw his first coming i'ma true her eyes were darkened they could not see his first coming how could they see his second coming when the second coming is the bride coming of Christ am i quoting rid of random what does he say coming out of the church you see why is it eight there's no way now we can take this message that's what I'm saying you say just don't tell them well they didn't tell them nothing about this and all but we can go over there now we get them Jews together and say now we don't tell you about this and we want to tell you that when we get out of here in the rapture God's going to turn to you and he's going to open your eyes because Moses and Elijah is coming to you you think I'd listen to you but it is not that the exact vision that was seen come on let's see those scholars knew when brother Brown was bringing that only hear you hear message they knew what are you talking about in the basis of Moses and Elijah and that would be the second coming of Jesus cried they knew that that's why he said it he said I know this pertains our readers mean I know this pertains to the second coming of Jesus Christ to Israel but he said I'd like to take it in just another little way a little form i think he used to work and he said i'd like to talk about this a little and said now we know that Jesus went through the early stages of its life and went through it and come out as to be the River Jordan now watch and you'll see the vision will just unfold as our part see in their part it's like a man looking at Luther when he's standing there preaching the just shall live by faith glory hallelujah I'm sealed in the body of Christ and here comes a man it's Lily's life perfect lined up everything's right in order and he said I see it I see what you don't Matt lucker lucker said yes but said this is something that's coming from in my heart yours is coming to in your head one listen I say it VOC saw the vision but one got the interpretation when got to head knowledge of it you realize church what I'm saying that we're having this message in our possession we have the answer to all of the theological of whatever you would want to speak of of the religious realm of mankind we have the answer to all of it but you think they're going to lay down their thoughts and listen to you come on no they don't see the vision that's what we're going to do with for a second we're going to look at it and try to see there's some don't see it now we're going to look at it and see it this way come on Peter James and John before they're born to get experience there was no way they could understand that vision the best that could have done was said o Moses Elijah that's coming to Israel it was the best secular gun they had no experience enough to understand the vision I hope you're going to get it what I'm talking about why the scripture says tell the vision to no man until a son of man be risen again now listen then you know you don't like my terminology and I don't need it but I just land blunt so evidently the first resurrection didn't fulfill the entirety of the vision because we've done proved that Israel is part of the vision Moses and Elijah part of the vision huh come on it wasn't fulfilled their why would it say hold this until the Son of Man comes from we know Jesus Christ with Deeks on a man we know he raised from the dead and we know he come back into the church on the deputy college right but the second coming of Jesus Christ hauling them never fully understood they spoke of it prophesied of it cold about it but did they really understand it if he did what you need a property to come from what did you need a profit for if you already understood it well I'll tell you what I understood this I notice that another yeah because you read what the Prophet said volition there has to be something about the end time that there is going to be a resurrection that will bring a resurrection now set that away now now quote brother branham that he preached a sermon one time called what raising Jesus from history evidently even the people that were supposed to know cannot follow it because brother branham goes then he said let me take this as a little other in other words a little another way we know it talks about Moses and Elijah coming to Israel we don't have anything due to us like take it about something has to do with us and let's see what he's talking about all right so he said we go to adoption he said adoption then is covered here in Matthew 17 why would you go that way we've got the point we know the point it's all right you got the right answer because diary starts where he stated this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased here you him now listen the only way you're going to know what this vision is to you is to hear him he's the only one has the answer goes on let's see how can i go to prove it holy ghost is the only revealer of the word no madam can reveal the word to you no matter if he's prophet priest or king you can't reveal the word to you you can bring it to your knowledge and your understanding you can bring things you never thought of but you cannot reveal it then the Prophet says and we go it goes into oh there's a bunch of syriza don't hear you him you know different messages I would invite you to at least listen to some of them there is a massive amount of them I look good today I don't know maybe 10 or 15 messages or more that literally are your him messages you know and he's covering adoption all right well now we've got it with Jesus on the Mount Transfiguration as adopted he was transfigured he was young they looked at him and they saw it it didn't help a little bit because they walked down off that mountain just as much as a bunch of unbelievers as they wasn't it went up I know you don't like out that burned down in the human minds but it's true didn't it they were the ones who came down and still wondering if he was on restore Israel we should television in the man now let's read a little bit more go ahead we're over on number three brother which is Matthew 17 but there's a few more scripture as it goes with Matthew 17 and it is to just say tell the vision no man look at it as they came down to the mountain Jesus car than saying television and oh man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead all right let's talk about him being risen again remains dead traditions and ideas did you know yourself what happened the early church started out right going forth with the word of God and he began to die and go diameter it had to for you and I to come forth as the seed we know that within him start Luther Wesley Pentecost he's one of them having the newburgh which they didn't see what is going on look what he says and the disciples look look at this story why we won't notice a Peter when an order why did he make that next statement Jesus told them simply don't television to no man until it's on a man be risen again and his disciples asked him saying you're telling us not to tell the vision why then say describes that Elias was first come then you're talking about the vision you're seeing Moses and Elijah and you know eliason and that's lot back and say but we just saw want to go Moses and Elijah and we've always had to understand it that'll ice is gonna come further right that's their understanding if you go over and ask them they'll tell you Moses precedes Elijah and that's what Israel is looking for they know Elijah has got to come they're looking for Elijah Reuben the very man that was guiding us told George this man could be the very Elijah this enter disciples after in order to ask him singing then waits once they describe to the last ones first gun jesus answered and said unto them a lot she'll first come and restore all things now he's speaking from back tire all the way down to here right read a lot truly shall first come that's kind of tricky like it was with what when he said don't tell the vision until the Son of Man be risen again that means there's something else to be involved so when they say but we thought a lot you was coming he said Elijah Elijah so first come he had already been and was dead by then right John would already dark and dad by this situation you'll restore all things we know the story right he went all the way from the DAR to come down to this day to see when it would be restored now listen what I say unto you that allies had already come and they knew him not would have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise y'all show the son of man suffering men of them then the disciples understood these taken to them of John the Baptist John the Baptist was the coming of allies right with number four license of clarinet verses that he's got to come and restore all things if you're listening you're going to catch the vision the vision is finality shows Moses and Elijah going to Israel now may I quote bread around them do you need this one I'll be glad to find it he said Moses and Elijah was talking to Jesus telling him I how he was coming you need that one Moses and lives talking to Jesus about his second coming and you're he's explaining his second coming his second coming is in two parts first you're going to have to pick up John and move on look at that one second but then he's going to be the Elijah Elijah is going to come and restore all things if you're listening to me i'll go ahead and make the statement we're aware it up this message is the second coming of Jesus Christ to the bride because it's not a physical coming to her and it's not brother branham it's the message he brought is that cleared up enough look I want you to notice something because I know you don't always get my capital letters and then my different letters and bangs and it don't mean anything to you but I wish you'd look right up there it's something and the disciples asked him saying while then say describes that Elijah was first come but I say unto you that Elijah is in comfort aletter I didn't write that they called it off better than there for a problem there's any trouble seeing my Bibles go for you did you get what I'm saying they ask why didn't describe say that her life was come he said but I send you that Elijah who John the badges has already come when we got to do is get back up here to find this one now you're seeing the mystery Jesus was adopted that's the mystery why would he start dealing with the end time Elijah because without the end time Elijah the message there is no adoption for the body of Jesus Christ guards your vision that they couldn't tell because they didn't know it okay read number for whatever number four here um talking about many other things that steadily meant to come in the order of the coming of Christ will get the other in a minute where it says a second coming the first you've seen how the order was they seem Jesus which was to appear and then they seen the coming of the glorified Norfolk ation and Moses and lives the very order of the second coming then when they look back they saw Jesus only when they looked again he went up on the mountain he was transfigured those disciples saw his very second coming what is his second coming to Israel to Moses and Elijah they know they something going on and one of the disciples stops and he says but we thought a las was to come and we haven't seen him he made the statement he said al I shall come and restore all things pointing 2,000 years down the road then he turned around plainly said look the largest doesn't come that Elijah moans you comfort allows that letter there that Elijah meaning the larger that you were looking for the one you say allies must come that Elijah has already come and then they understood him speaking of John the Baptist so what is it Moses is alive they're very order of the second coming roll it on up let's go to Patmos vision 1962 see that was nineteen sixty and the three possible did see that snap on every something here which shall not taste death until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom aren't that's him with his creature and they seem that the three went up on the mountain and seen him coming in his kingdom right and the three apostles did see just that the order of his second coming they saw him transfigured there on the mountaintop his raiment was blazing white in his face shine like the Sun at its zenith and there as he appeared to Moses and Elijah on either side that's exactly how he is coming again now remember the scripture want to go listen remember the scripture while ago what's it saying up here we thought alive yours to come he jumps 2,000 years and he said Elijah shall come and restore all things we said here's your Elijah what's this they're here and as better as he appeared to Moses and Elijah on either side that is exactly how he is coming again there's the Israel now watch truly Elijah will come and turn the hearts of the children ride back to the father's apostolic doctrine now which one of his comings is the own your he's on his second coming to Israel here he's only a second coming to the bride are you with me actually how he's coming number six here you him have you talking about adoption he he bringing it into adoption because listen only through adoption he's anybody going to be able to understand this vision the problem let me just make a statement when I understand it look glory without adoption being involved you can't understand the mystery that's the mystery that's being revealed then maybe you haven't been adopted you still love them and there aren't in your heart have you been like a separated person not been like it didn't maybe you haven't been adopted but once adopted for leasing the place in the body of Christ you're an heir of all things notice what God did to hear Sean God didn't ask them to do anything ask us to do anything that he would not do he took his own son who had been Toby you he was just a little before the cruise that's was just a little before the crucifixion everybody said come down the son of man goes to Jerusalem be delivered in the hands of the Gentile said don't tell the vision to anyone okay but while they were standing there God adopted his own son he's ours division hurry over shattered him and the Bible said that he put a robe on him and so much that his raiment shine like the Sun in extreme set up before heavenly witnesses before earthly witnesses no more said this is my beloved son here um whatever he said it's just as good as my word he was adopted jesus said all pires in heaven and earth he's given unto my hands there's the adoption of God's adopting his son man of Transfiguration is adoption you're not going to get to adoption and that's an Elijah comes first the order of the second coming to Israel is remoted and Elijah boat the order of the second coming to the bride of Jesus Christ is a dot is Elijah not dealing with Moses okay you walk with me let's get one more go to number seven it came down to the mountain Jesus charge and saying tell no man to tell division dunno man see don't tell this you know it but keep it to yourself hell no man division till the Son of Man be risen from the dead don't tell it he said you know it in other words they understood they saw what are you talking about their seen this happened over here they saw that happen over time today no need of you going down there and try to explain to them what you say because nobody's going to understand this until the end time that Elijah has got to come first if jesus said and restore all things so Elijah coming is proven the second resurrection is at hand the first resurrection was the Lord Jesus cried I know the scripture come on I know this the first resurrection second in the script second resurrection comes on over to the day at around we know that we're talking about to you and I they're talking about you and I see you had a resurrection when you got born again adoption will bring you to a resurrection or bring him to a resurrection again but it got to be Elijah can't be no other way it's got to be free or Elijah waited number 9 let's get this revelations chapter 4 this is what Wade was reading over in this place and he saw the coming are the rehearsal that's a physical coming it wouldn't taking place it was rehearsal you know what her arsenal is you're just learning your part you're practicing it wasn't seen expect our because they loaded up what I've covered your to see that it can't be finished because of Israel isn't even started hit the bride is dependent upon where Elijah could coming up when we play the lunch okay then we believe all he said or we believe what he said that I want to believe is right and what was the first the first thing he saw a reversal first thing he's going to come in with Moses watch him remember Wade Sunday representing the dead Saints that would be resurrected so now we're going to bring Moses and Elijah right in here with us because there's Moses representing the saints that are in the grave representative dead Saints who will be resurrected Elijah was standing there and I want you to notice what will take place there was Moses first that's all these six ages that they slept remember when down coming in six Church ages not only that but Elijah was our the messenger of the last days with his group of the transfigured the raptured amen now in the future of waiting to come in some standing here that will not taste death until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom and they seen the rehearsal of it after this is the resurrection they saw a rehearsal of getting ready for number ten they don't hear um now I do know that these ministers behind me may be wondering because in top they talking about Matthew 17 round everybody would it was showing the second coming of Jesus Christ that's the real way to approach it because it literally shows the life thing that's going to take place right where it showed first Jesus glorified second the message to the Jews which will be the true prophets of Revelations 11 Moses and Elijah and then when they look like they saw Jesus on me the real approach because if we see him coming from here and going to israel in what takes place we come back and know that Elijah has got to come first according to Malachi you've got to come restore all things and we know that's already taking place right it represented a second coming first they look nice all Moses this is from here um it's number eleven who is returning the last days before the coming of the Lord listen let's read it and of course it did mean and it represents the second coming as we find that it was first they looked up and they saw Moses and Elijah who is to return in the last days before the coming of the Lord are the taking away of the remnant of the Jewish Church to preach to the three and a half years at the left and Daniel right it's got to come to them but that still ain't broke the vision to them yet but has it broke to you you know our full dependence is Jen cows our full dependences Gentiles is upon the basis of whether or not God will keep his word the best I can say it is what we know you will without Elijah to come in the last days to bring us the message there is no hoax of adoption because according to Malachi is to turn the hearts of the children back to the Father's right how did brother branham explain that 327 church age book why do you say especially romelic I for revelation 10-7 or what it says it will turn ours for the children back to the faith of the fathers and then he will reveal the thunders which is revelation contained in the seven seals and said it be these divinely revealed mystery troops that literally not rehearsing it literally during the hearts and the children back so that's in this message now watch as we end it we think about and we read Hebrews 11 40 huh and it says they without us cannot be made perfect we don't you read down through that in Hebrews 11 nourish all the way down except the last couple of verses is really dealing with Israel Oh today without us cannot be made perfect then we follow that over to the church ages and we bring it down through there and showing the church ages that the people have died and went on waiting and we say they without us cannot be made perfect you realize they can't be no second coming of Jesus Christ to the Jews unless he completes his second coming to the bride that's why I life had to come that's why Jesus said to the life shall come and restore all things no don't worry about it we don't have to worry about it's a promise the problem is we just may not be a part of it go we may not have caught the vision yet the vision of what's really going to take place now Jesus only spoke of it on Mount transferring to Russia the only type that are showed it it's your adoption in mind that has to finish this thing up well I just don't see it well I want to bring a little message I've been studying for months now that we we think that we could get good enough for God to be able to fulfill his word I wish that was true undo I wish it was true and within when you say I got you know believe it cuz there's another part goes with it if we're the only one that's holding off the Second Coming then what is it and if the second coming of Jesus Christ is the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church that's what your profits did what about it prophet said ain't but one thing holding off the coming of the Lord what is that was the readiness of the bride well we've had 50 something years now 50 years dedicated especially for that no listen this should have never been for anything other than preparation what's going to bring Jesus Christ adoption in the Bride of Christ because that's what the vision was vision was don't show no man this no tell nobody about this adoption and how I'm coming but don't you worry about telling them said cuz I'm gonna be here myself that's the only thing that I've ever taught me only thing I've ever believed if you look up the word come when you go home I thought your prophet said 270 was a coming of the Lord and look it up enough until you finally find this definition the word come means to be here well that's just something you come up with well let's see you come on something like it right because that fits exactly if he's not here there's not going on going dire somebody's gonna have to get serious enough and call on God enough to bring it to pies because that's the way it has always been your prophet said I brought it to you are the other day in that message over and over the people crying out to God is one of make him fulfill his word maybe we're not serious enough i'll try to explain that the best i could do he's a day but one thing holding off for coming the lord that's the readiness in the bride so then we've had all these years to get ready we've had the message remember to everything later in our hand I thank God for everybody that has ever in any way home users and in any way or everything and tried to help me to understand this word I thank God for all that they've done in putting the books and the tapes and the things out to where we can get it I thank God for all of these it has had anything to do with allowing us to receive the word I might not agree with the way a lot of people approach things but I look at the ultimate end because see I still got that dog don't even try to tell the vision just let it go don't try to tell it until the Son of Man be risen again well I thought we believe the Son of Man was to be the bride of Jesus Christ in feminist form according to revelations 11 stint in the midst of selling over Tennessee like under the Son of Man heard about the pouch for the golden girdle I thought that was the finished form of the coming of Jesus Christ I thought to coming to Jesus Christ was coming in me and you have you caught the vision as the vision open is this message brought a vision to you no no I've never seen a vision the Bible says without a vision the people perish now that looks like it's God's fault because he's not giving you a lot a right to see a vision that's not what it's talking about if you don't have a vision yourself not to go out something you see but to have a vision within your heart in your life of what this message and Bible is the brain then will perish we'll just keep dying to see somebody is going to come that place right what we got brother somebody's gonna say I seen the vision may I said as we rented Peter got close close it when he was saying that about that holy mountain he said we're gathered about round about my so great a cloud of witnesses he said in other words my mind he said is going back to the day that I saw him on that mountain he was transfigured before me and now I have that man that was transfigured into my soul living by personal experience and I have a greater or what now within issue what do you say I have a more sure word of prophecy now what could be more sure than seeing Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration showing the second coming showing all the times what could be a greater thing our vision to you why would he make that statement he said I have a more sure word I was there I saw that happen but I've got a more sure why because he had something inside of him that took him to a cross that hung him upside down he would not let him hang him the way Jesus was you remember the story was told of him it's just a story telling if they saw this man walking out of Jerusalem because it's killing him and they said where you going son leaving it aren't you Peter yeah within what hopes would there be for any of us if you're Peter to be able to understand that the stories told it's a story fictitious he turned around and went right back and gave his life what was the more sure word of prophecy and experience within his heart of the new birth that all that Bible speaking of what good is a Mount of Transfiguration and knowing all the ins and outs or this thing to finish it if you don't have a personal experience with Jesus Christ go ahead brother number six of the five-number see do you have a more sure word of prophecy [Music] body at all of us Baltimore no age factor and coming off but that don't have to be true cause I've got emotional word of prophecy I've got the word of my Master's favor they said by your stripes we are healed now lay hands with my brother agree that this problem will be gone from it because we know that it torments the technician time start working outdoors that everything be in the right order if Jesus [Music] what about it can you say you had a personal experience that master [Music] then you're capable of understanding division but without that there's no way you'll never get a vision [Music] he laude go what about it great mystery evasion nobody work together until dickbag [Music] upy depend upon the Prophet smashing cause it linked in prod a human vision to my natural mind that there are holders there's a hole in this day we don't have to live defeated more down you stand on these words thank you don't say this is it all I'll have dreams for 23 years I'll be by on the answer [Music] Robbie's if you have a dream class name something ah see if we just believe it he works in his ways the runtimes divine mother we thank you we just commit everything into your hand Lord we pray it should help us to see the vision to see that the Son of Man is risen again in the hearts and lives of mankind and getting us ready for a change it take us out of here notice all in you lord come and open the vision because it was sealed up by Daniel pneus you told him still a vision fill it up but then in the end time is to be understood we thank you for it we love you we committed to you now in Jesus night remember Anna Lord and sick remember all the rest all the different kinds of sicknesses among us just touch each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you just wish these are the days of Elijah [Music] Oh [Music] these are the days of your servant Moses righteousness being restored and these are the days of great trial [Music]
