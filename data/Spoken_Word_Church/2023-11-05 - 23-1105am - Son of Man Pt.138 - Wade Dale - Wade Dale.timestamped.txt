[30:46] forgive us of our many faults and
[30:48] mistakes that we make Lord may we sit
[30:50] down just a few minutes and hear from
[30:51] you in Jesus name we pray amen we're on
[30:55] part 136 in in the beginning was the
[30:57] word word was with God and the Word was
[30:59] God and the word I know y'all can't read
[31:03] that sorry I'm trying to hurry up it
[31:05] took too much time and the Word was made
[31:07] flesh and dwelt Among
[31:10] Us that
[31:13] better wait a minute that's
[31:16] better and the Word was made flesh and
[31:18] dwelt among us and we what we beheld his
[31:21] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[31:23] the father full of grace and truth John
[31:25] 16:12 says I have yet many things to say
[31:28] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[31:30] how be how be it when he the spirit of
[31:33] Truth as like brother uh Vernon was
[31:36] talking about this past weekend the
[31:37] continuity of the word it just continues
[31:39] to carry on it doesn't have to carry on
[31:41] in one vessel it carry on in in several
[31:43] different vessels Jesus knew he was
[31:45] leaving he knew that they weren't
[31:47] understanding what he was saying but he
[31:49] knew that when the spirit of Truth come
[31:51] and would enter them on the day of
[31:52] Pentecost that Peter James and John
[31:55] would be the spokesman then it would go
[31:56] to Paul then it go to arenus and
[31:58] continue to this day right here all
[32:01] right this is Jesus speaking how be it
[32:04] when he the spirit of Truth what he the
[32:06] Holy Ghost is come he will guide you
[32:08] into all Truth for he shall not speak of
[32:11] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[32:13] that shall he speak remember he's
[32:15] talking through the bride and to the
[32:16] bride and he will show you things to
[32:19] come you may be seed it he'll show you
[32:20] Revelation that's what we're looking for
[32:22] revelation we live on Revelation we
[32:24] thrive on Revelation and even New Birth
[32:27] is a revelation all right so we're
[32:30] looking at the
[32:31] Revelation that we are the sons and
[32:33] daughters of God right now we know we
[32:36] can go into before the foundation of the
[32:38] world and all that which is fine but
[32:40] that's in the mind of God we're right
[32:41] here today in flesh we're human beings
[32:44] and if we're not born again we're lost
[32:45] there's not an in between okay all right
[32:48] so brother B says when you must be born
[32:49] again said you're still once you were
[32:51] until you're actually born again of the
[32:52] spirit of God in other words those
[32:55] Creeds doesn't change you
[32:57] as brother Bob said you know somebody
[32:59] saying that you need to go to church
[33:01] that's not going to change
[33:02] anybody cuz the same people keep stand
[33:05] out so so it's got to be God get a hold
[33:08] of you so I pray that God gets a hold of
[33:10] all of us today that he gets a hold of
[33:13] all of us and he does a work and he will
[33:16] convict us and when he convicts us you
[33:18] remember at your new birth the preacher
[33:21] didn't convict you the Holy Ghost
[33:23] convicted you and brought you to the
[33:26] altar
[33:27] you say oh well it was through a vessel
[33:29] sure it was through a vessel of
[33:30] preaching and a vessel of bringing the
[33:32] anointing down and and a vessel of
[33:34] opening up and saying hey you need to be
[33:36] born again but it wasn't that preacher's
[33:38] voice that bed you it was God inside of
[33:40] you is what bed you amen when he said
[33:43] you're a child of mine I can tell you
[33:45] that all I want to but that's not going
[33:47] to do you any good your mama your daddy
[33:49] your preacher everybody anybody can say
[33:50] yeah you're a child of God but until God
[33:52] says you're a child of
[33:54] God secondhand information
[33:57] and it can be wrong right but not from
[34:00] God it's not so the new birth is an
[34:03] experience something that takes place or
[34:05] something that we go through that we
[34:07] understand in this church it's
[34:09] justification sanctification and the
[34:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost brings you to
[34:13] the New Birth because you can and and
[34:16] yesterday I was thinking about something
[34:18] going on in the world and all and I
[34:19] thought Lord you know that's no it was
[34:21] it was this morning I was thinking about
[34:23] and it was anointed ones and they're
[34:25] they're Anointed with the true holy
[34:28] ghost it's not the the Holy Ghost is not
[34:30] false never has been never will be but
[34:34] it can anoint you and your
[34:37] fults that's what we're living under now
[34:40] but if you get the new birth in your
[34:41] soul the Holy Ghost can't
[34:43] be leading you and you be false that's
[34:47] right it's truth and truth all
[34:50] right mechanics Dynamics they all got to
[34:53] come together you got to have two pieces
[34:55] to vulcanize got to have two pieces of
[34:58] rubber to vulcanize all right so the new
[35:00] birth is an experience something that
[35:02] takes place so it's not that thing that
[35:05] brings the new birth in other words come
[35:06] to church and and the dos and don'ts
[35:08] that we talk about all the time it's
[35:11] what I tell you one brother said he and
[35:13] he's just plain as he could be he said
[35:14] you will not have to tell a holy ghost
[35:17] filled person to go to church you're not
[35:20] preaching the Holy Ghost fill
[35:22] people that they don't go to church they
[35:24] just ain't got the Holy Ghost
[35:27] you be quiet if you want to but it's
[35:28] truth how in the world you going to sit
[35:31] home and the Holy Ghost Inside of You
[35:33] says I got to go hear what's going on
[35:36] and be among a brother and sister and be
[35:38] among be in a fellowship and be in a
[35:40] assemble yourself together right and we
[35:44] can make all kind of excuses but there
[35:46] is
[35:47] none now brother Brown tells us he says
[35:51] I hope the church and we'll talk about
[35:52] this a little more this
[35:54] afternoon because the the Bible tells us
[35:57] that he is the head of the body of the
[35:59] church yes all right well now that has
[36:02] to be separated because not all church
[36:05] is church not all church is
[36:08] Bride come
[36:10] on but but we had a prophet comeing the
[36:13] end time to what rightly divide the word
[36:15] of Truth this is truth this is error
[36:19] this is the church this is the bride he
[36:21] separated them out all right because
[36:24] what the word is a discerner of the
[36:26] thoughts intense of the heart just like
[36:27] brother B could stand and say you're
[36:29] from so and so place and you drive a red
[36:31] car and you I mean he the doctor had on
[36:34] a red coat I mean he just was so vivid
[36:36] why cuz it was a vision he was watching
[36:40] television all right he was watching
[36:42] what was going on and that was because
[36:45] the word of God had come to a prophet
[36:47] and had opened up that Dimension well I
[36:49] pray to God that God opens up a
[36:51] dimension in our life today not so much
[36:53] that I got to see what's in your life or
[36:55] what's in my life that will determine
[36:57] itself as brother Bob was talking about
[36:59] keep watching the life keep watching
[37:02] what it produces all right now we have
[37:04] our ups and downs and we can be critical
[37:06] and non-critical but let's just what
[37:08] consider the end of your conversation
[37:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[37:13] and forever so now we see a church we we
[37:16] keep reading in the Bible about a church
[37:18] but there's a prophet came in the end
[37:19] time he said now I'm going to call you
[37:21] Bride on the first seal when that first
[37:23] seal is getting ready to open he sees
[37:25] where the white horse rider is he sees
[37:26] Us in the
[37:28] church huh he sees us in the church but
[37:32] he also sees it riding away from him in
[37:35] his Revelation the white horse rider he
[37:37] said here stands the lamb and there goes
[37:38] the white horse rider well what was
[37:40] riding off the pretense of the church
[37:44] the falseness of that
[37:46] denominational cuz he stands there one
[37:48] day and he says now I know why I hate
[37:52] denominations cuz it's a nickeled and
[37:54] spirit and God hates nickeled and spirit
[37:56] so do we all right you know
[37:58] denominational ideas can be can come in
[38:00] many forms you can't say well the
[38:02] Baptist and the Methodist and the
[38:04] Pentecostal right look at some of their
[38:08] Tendencies and you see some of the
[38:09] Tendencies trying to creep back in the
[38:12] church I'm going to preach
[38:14] anyway but it has we sit we listen and
[38:18] we go home and we just keep going over
[38:20] and over again and we bind the church we
[38:24] bind the spirit of the church by the way
[38:26] we Act
[38:28] think but there's a
[38:30] bride she's without spot or wrinkle
[38:33] she's going to be perfect she's
[38:36] righteous just as righteous as he is so
[38:40] never since Jesus Christ was on this
[38:42] Earth has Satan has such a formidable
[38:43] opponent he doesn't know what to do with
[38:45] us right now there's times when he does
[38:49] oh yeah hey reach take your finger and
[38:53] pinch yourself right here okay the devil
[38:56] just pinch you on the
[38:59] hand but he he's got a formidable
[39:02] opponent inside and now we're trying to
[39:04] work that thing out to where the
[39:06] Cornerstone can become The Headstone not
[39:08] just in a building but in you right
[39:11] we're talking about me and you we're not
[39:12] talking about the world we I wish that
[39:14] I'm like I'm like the Lord I wish that
[39:17] all would be saved don't you look at
[39:19] people and say oh man if you could just
[39:21] get saved just just get
[39:25] salvation but
[39:27] God knows it will he knows it won't you
[39:29] just got to present it to him number one
[39:31] in what in your
[39:33] life in 1965 brother Brown on the rise
[39:36] in the sun he said there has been
[39:37] churches churches Brides brides there
[39:39] has been Brides there been bride listen
[39:42] Jesus Jehovah was married to the Old
[39:45] Testament
[39:46] Jews and we're going to read something
[39:48] here in just a few minutes where Jesus
[39:50] stands one day and he says you had all
[39:53] this The Headstone is here you rejected
[39:57] it but I'm going to give it to a
[39:59] nation that'll receive it and that's the
[40:02] Gentiles he took it from the Jews and
[40:04] give it to us praise God we'll reading
[40:08] it in a minute where Jesus was standing
[40:09] there telling them in other words I was
[40:12] married to you remember we read it long
[40:14] long when we first got started he says I
[40:16] was married to you but you went whing in
[40:18] other words what you took a horse
[40:19] forehead or you took a denominational
[40:22] idea contrary to the word of God all
[40:25] right right you know people try to sit
[40:28] in church and bind church that's a
[40:30] denominational Spirit
[40:32] right when you bind the freedom of the
[40:34] ministry you are you have a
[40:36] denominational spirit all right we need
[40:39] to get rid of that Bel look brother said
[40:42] back there's got to come one so he's
[40:43] honing it down just like that thing is
[40:45] being
[40:46] honed in me and you the prophet of God
[40:49] is honing it down he's a he's a master
[40:52] builder remember he types zerubabel in
[40:54] the Bible about building and all those
[40:56] things he was a master builder Elijah
[40:59] Elijah was a builder remember they
[41:02] destroyed the whole they destroyed the
[41:03] whole Tabernacle well not the Tabernacle
[41:05] but the altar he put them all back
[41:07] together then that's when the fire fell
[41:10] all right but it's got to come one
[41:12] Hallelujah there's got to come a real
[41:14] bride so then you've got now a false
[41:17] bride and a real
[41:19] bride cuz you're going to have to have
[41:21] Satan's
[41:24] bride oh he's got a bride
[41:27] yeah he just don't know how to get to do
[41:29] things do things like he wants them done
[41:33] bless his
[41:36] heart he is listen if you'll just break
[41:40] it all down he has no control over
[41:43] nothing nothing we listen what's our
[41:46] greatest Mountain what's our greatest
[41:47] fear
[41:49] death God
[41:52] allows you to die when he allows you to
[41:55] die not when Satan says no I think I'm
[41:57] going to take them today no God said no
[41:59] hang on minute that's right no not today
[42:03] not I have a plan I have a purpose amen
[42:07] I have something to do with my children
[42:08] and then maybe I'm going to take them
[42:11] home see that's the way I see it and I
[42:13] I've said it at many funerals same way
[42:15] with if you're a holy ghost filled
[42:16] person today I don't believe the death
[42:18] angel comes and picks you
[42:20] up that's a death
[42:23] angel oh well brother we die no the
[42:26] Bible says no Christians can't die they
[42:29] don't die they just move into another
[42:30] place I like what brother Donnie rean
[42:33] you know he lost his daughter a couple
[42:34] weeks ago and he preached one sermon
[42:36] called why which was wonderful and then
[42:39] he preached last week about an update on
[42:43] Erica which is his daughter that passed
[42:45] away he said I want to let you know
[42:47] since she's moved come on so you can
[42:51] think about what what went on in the
[42:52] sermon she's moved she's she's gone to
[42:54] another place and it was wonderful you
[42:57] ought to go see it sometime he is a good
[42:59] Minister but there must come one that
[43:01] not only got the mechanics but the
[43:03] Dynamics makes the church live move in
[43:05] the power of Resurrection until we come
[43:07] to that place look till we come to that
[43:10] place what good is it the Polish of hubs
[43:13] all right what good is it to make that
[43:14] car look good if it ain't got anything
[43:16] in it to drive it all right so Hebrews 4
[43:20] and 12 the Bible says for the word of
[43:21] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[43:23] than any two-edged sword so the word of
[43:25] God is what's going to loose us yes from
[43:29] our sins or loose us from our ideas and
[43:31] from our thoughts that's why the word of
[43:33] God has been disrespected and put out of
[43:36] the denominational World they don't want
[43:38] God remember he's outside trying to get
[43:42] in huh amen that's what it says in our
[43:45] church age behold I stand at the what
[43:48] door and
[43:50] knock and if anyone will let me in in
[43:52] other words there got to be somebody on
[43:54] this side of the door and many people
[43:57] will not reach and get the door knob and
[43:58] let him
[44:00] in but we have praise
[44:02] God we have made we have been made an
[44:05] given an entrance as we were talking
[44:06] about the other day an Open Door yes
[44:09] it's all open now there's nothing hi
[44:12] everything's out in the
[44:14] open piercing even to the dividing of
[44:16] sun of Soul and Spirit we see where the
[44:18] prophet of God was the only one that
[44:21] could pull that thing apart and show us
[44:23] cuz it was a mind of God yes God wanted
[44:25] it because this was the Bible That's
[44:27] right The Bible had to be fulfilled he
[44:29] had to tell us there's going to be a
[44:30] true bride he had to tell us that the
[44:32] church was over here and the bride was
[44:34] over here he had to tell us that he's
[44:37] going to send us a word of God to do
[44:38] something not just say well I'm right
[44:41] and you're wrong no that ain't
[44:43] it that's not
[44:46] it it's piercing even to the dividing of
[44:49] sun of Soul and Spirit and join in
[44:52] Marrow your your flesh and there's a
[44:55] discerner the thoughts and intents of
[44:57] the heart so we looked at the soul of
[44:59] man the soul of man today is if you're
[45:01] sitting here today it's the real
[45:04] you it's the part of you that that most
[45:06] people can't that nobody can see except
[45:08] what you display
[45:10] amen you can hide things you can put
[45:13] things over here you can hide this you
[45:15] can hide this but that soul is what's
[45:17] going to stand at the day of judgment if
[45:19] you have to stand at the day of judgment
[45:21] that soul of you is going to stand at
[45:22] the day of judgment now you're going to
[45:25] take your spirit in your flesh with you
[45:28] cuz you're one unit everybody with
[45:31] me but if you got the soul of almighty
[45:33] God how you going to be judged right how
[45:36] you going you're standing your judgment
[45:38] now we have as brother Bob was talking
[45:40] about we have separated oursel the Holy
[45:42] Ghost has separated us and ask us and
[45:45] and and not ask us and probably I don't
[45:47] say demand but he loves for us to live a
[45:50] separated life amen to where when we
[45:53] walk down the road they say and usually
[45:55] the world says what's wrong with that PE
[45:57] that person we want to say what's right
[45:59] about it but they want to say what's
[46:01] wrong with that person what's wrong with
[46:02] that sister oh look look old with her
[46:04] hair long and hey you know
[46:07] what God loves it if God loves it I love
[46:10] it all right so your soul today is
[46:13] either Faith or doubt you're either born
[46:15] again or you're not born again everybody
[46:17] with me all right the spirit realm
[46:19] though has five senses memory reasoning
[46:21] conscious affe and Imagination that's
[46:23] where we have our problem that's right
[46:25] right right even though your soul as we
[46:28] were talking not too long ago you know
[46:31] if you're born again today your soul
[46:33] don't sin
[46:36] abely so the real you doesn't sin but
[46:40] you see how strong that sin was in the
[46:42] garden from the memory Reon and
[46:44] conscious affection imagination and then
[46:46] out into your flesh you see how God had
[46:48] to separate that
[46:51] thing but then he brings it back
[46:53] together and he says the soul that sinth
[46:55] will surely die that's right not this
[46:59] the soul that sinth shall surely die not
[47:02] the spirit the
[47:04] soul God said All Souls are mine he
[47:06] gives them he takes them away he's the
[47:08] only one that can't Satan can't create
[47:10] he can't take them away God's the only
[47:12] one that can do it absolutely praise God
[47:15] we serve a God that's in control yes sir
[47:18] whether we think he's out of we're out
[47:19] of control we praise God we have a God
[47:22] that's totally in control of everything
[47:25] and sure we ask why brother Donnie said
[47:27] and I was preaching the other Wednesday
[47:28] night on on you know questioning God and
[47:30] questioning what's going on and we saw
[47:32] that a prophet question God and got in
[47:34] trouble for doing that but the
[47:36] Providence of God we know one thing for
[47:39] sure he cannot make a mistake any move
[47:41] he makes is the right
[47:43] move so we must accept that yes we must
[47:47] accept that and move on instead of
[47:49] having a pity
[47:51] party sir listen we've had I was looking
[47:54] at the the 40th iversary picture in
[47:56] there on the St in the study and there's
[47:59] six
[48:00] people now there's more than that that's
[48:02] left the church but there's six people
[48:03] that's physically passed away that went
[48:05] to this went been to this church since
[48:07] the 40th
[48:08] anniversary six people passed away moved
[48:11] over in you know they don't live here no
[48:13] more right they live over another
[48:14] dimension but you know what what took
[48:16] them over there was what they heard
[48:20] here and what they took in that's why
[48:23] church is important what you take in is
[48:25] what you going to take over there that's
[48:27] right if you got an animosity to a
[48:28] brother you're not going to take it over
[48:30] there you might go over in another place
[48:31] over here but you're not going to go in
[48:33] that
[48:34] place cuz that's where your soul goes
[48:38] yes everybody with me that's how how
[48:41] hideous sin was when God had to separate
[48:44] that thing he said I'll put enmity I'm
[48:47] going to put a division between I can't
[48:49] even stand to see what y'all did but I'm
[48:52] going to make a
[48:54] provision
[48:56] that's right I'm going to take a
[48:58] lamb I'm going to kill it
[49:00] myself yeah God killed a lamb what do
[49:03] you think who do you think did that in
[49:04] the Bible Well your God don't have hands
[49:07] my God's a human if you don't if you
[49:09] don't mind me saying he's not a clown
[49:11] he's not a spook he's not Casper the
[49:12] Friendly Ghost he's a man and he's way
[49:15] more real than we are and he's way more
[49:17] solid than we are sir and way more
[49:21] intelligent than we are so let's trust
[49:23] in what he's done I listen as brother
[49:26] Ernie vill W always said he said you got
[49:28] to plug yourself into the
[49:30] Eternal if you're born again today you
[49:32] are plugged into that Eternal and you
[49:35] can't be unplugged that's right but you
[49:37] got when you get plugged in you got to
[49:39] do what the current
[49:42] says turn the light on yes sir Ephesians
[49:46] 1 verse4 says according as he has chosen
[49:48] us we're going to read this this
[49:50] afternoon a little bit different
[49:52] according as he has chosen Us in him
[49:54] before the foundation of the world so in
[49:56] the mind of God we were chosen of God we
[49:58] were perfected in
[50:01] God that Genesis 126 man never sinned
[50:04] right that's why when it comes to you
[50:06] it's a new birth it burns all that out
[50:08] and you don't have to stand judgment you
[50:10] don't have to stand you don't have to
[50:11] stand at the Judgment bar praise God
[50:14] that scar people to death I heard a guy
[50:17] the other day and he was a
[50:18] denominational guy he said he said well
[50:20] when I get to judgment I hope I he you
[50:22] know XYZ I thought
[50:24] man I leave a denomination that told me
[50:27] I was going to have to go through the
[50:28] tribulation period and go say before the
[50:31] white Throne judgment I'd leave them
[50:33] didn't you you're sting here today you
[50:37] left it because of something must have
[50:38] been false
[50:40] Doctrine Lord there's some good people
[50:43] out there but listen that system is
[50:45] rotten God hates that thing all right we
[50:48] don't hate the people but if you attach
[50:50] yourself to it just like if you attach
[50:52] yourself to it then you're part of it so
[50:55] let's be a part of the Eternal we've
[50:57] attached oursel to the Eternal all right
[51:00] having predestinated us into the
[51:02] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[51:04] where to himself listen if everything we
[51:07] do if we get Jesus Christ does it in
[51:11] himself yes that's where we're perfect
[51:14] that's where we're without spot that's
[51:16] where we're without wrinkle yes sir not
[51:18] in our own
[51:19] righteousness filthy rags you ever took
[51:22] an old filthy rag I found one other day
[51:24] out in the yard oh it was horrible
[51:26] that's my and your righteousness to God
[51:29] but brother John he took that rag yes
[51:32] and one day he cleaned it up he used the
[51:35] bleach of the Holy Ghost and he cleaned
[51:37] that thing up and now there ain't a spot
[51:39] nowhere praise God for that amen sorry I
[51:44] was going to teach a little bit but I'm
[51:46] preaching something so but look also we
[51:48] got to remember too that as we go
[51:50] through this uh plan of God we have to
[51:54] know that we have to come to adoption
[51:57] because it's required in this age
[52:00] because look having predestinated us yes
[52:04] predetermined pre
[52:07] predestiny
[52:09] determined why could he pre Destiny
[52:12] determined cuz he saw that there'd be a
[52:13] group of people here and he'd have his
[52:15] word to connect to it right all right
[52:18] see we've got to know that see in
[52:19] Luther's day he connected with the just
[52:21] shall live by faith now he didn't
[52:23] connect with one God come on he was a
[52:26] trinitarian but we connect to that
[52:31] that's why the prophet of God had to
[52:32] come take all the Loose Ends and bring
[52:34] them back
[52:36] together so having predestinated us so
[52:38] we're predestinated to what not just to
[52:40] get born again but to be adopted yes to
[52:43] be a son and daughter of God that can
[52:45] stand here one day and as we'll read
[52:46] here maybe this afternoon where brother
[52:48] Ram said you pray for the sick now he
[52:50] said you'll command it
[52:54] then what
[52:55] you'll command what yeah but you know
[52:59] what we got to command this guy
[53:01] first this guy is my worst enemy right
[53:05] right so your adoption is not your birth
[53:08] your adoption is your placing so but
[53:10] You' got to be born again so you can
[53:12] come into the line of adoption because
[53:14] you can't be adopted without being born
[53:16] again all right and what is adoption
[53:19] we'll talk about this afternoon I'll
[53:20] break it all down how it was in the Old
[53:21] Testament and how it is in Israel now
[53:23] called a bar mitzvah and we'll see what
[53:26] that means because we got to talk about
[53:28] the placing your adoption is your
[53:30] placing yes it's not the place you
[53:34] sit okay
[53:36] physically but it's the place that you
[53:38] are at in the word of God it's the place
[53:41] that you're at in
[53:43] maturity or
[53:47] not we've been going to this church a
[53:49] long time lot of you've been going a
[53:51] long time all your life we've got to
[53:54] come to adoption it's been preached 50
[53:56] years ago and it's still being preached
[53:57] now we have got to come on speaking
[54:00] terms with God speaking condition with
[54:02] God where he can use us use a powerful
[54:06] Church they may just be one I contend
[54:08] this is it if not we need to go find
[54:11] it I didn't get many amens out of
[54:16] that but when you're born again of the
[54:19] spirit of God you're son of daughter of
[54:20] God we know that right but we were
[54:23] predestinated I see separated it we were
[54:25] predestinated to what to
[54:28] adoption all right God don't want
[54:30] children sure he loved the Pentecostal
[54:32] battling babies ones that spoke in
[54:33] tongues and thought that was the Holy
[54:35] Ghost and they'd have this gift over
[54:36] here and they somebody be brother even
[54:38] brother ran be preaching and somebody
[54:39] jump up and speak in tongues that's
[54:41] totally out of order but he allowed it
[54:43] to happen and he kept telling the now he
[54:46] kep kept telling his home church he said
[54:47] hey quit doing that all right right he
[54:50] put everything in order but it was
[54:52] babies and brother Brown knew it was
[54:54] babies he knew was talking to baby
[54:56] somebody that didn't even know what he
[54:58] was talking about most of the time cuz
[55:00] remember we'll read it where he said
[55:02] it's not to you it's not for
[55:04] you so what is
[55:08] adoption let's go to Peter because Peter
[55:10] talks about it say if these things be in
[55:12] you and abound what these things right
[55:16] be in you and abound in other words you
[55:18] use
[55:20] them I like what brother brother Aaron
[55:23] or somebody's got a a quote said if you
[55:25] haven't used anything in 7 months or
[55:27] something he said you need to throw it
[55:29] away well if you hadn't used these in s
[55:32] months you better start you better start
[55:35] praying cuz this is God In Motion this
[55:38] is God using us to do something all
[55:40] right he's trying to get us to listen to
[55:43] what he's
[55:46] saying bre these being in you and ab
[55:48] bound they make
[55:50] you Peter old rough old rough Peter the
[55:54] old fisherman Peter Peter said this will
[55:57] make you that you shall neither be
[55:59] bearing nor and fruitful in the
[56:01] knowledge of Our Lord why we come to
[56:02] church if we don't want to be fruitful
[56:05] why we have Christian if we don't want
[56:06] to become fruitful I think the Bible
[56:08] says show fruit meet for repentence show
[56:13] fruit listen if you're not showing fruit
[56:16] then your Vine got cut down
[56:18] somewhere cuz if you put it in the
[56:20] ground and you give it the right
[56:21] nourishment and you keep it trimmed come
[56:23] on somebody it will produce
[56:27] fruit just a law of it's just a law of
[56:31] production but he that lack at these
[56:33] things is blind all right you may be
[56:35] born again but you're blind you're still
[56:36] a baby right you know BL babies may be
[56:39] able to see but they're
[56:41] blind what are they blind to they're
[56:43] blind to that that's hot don't touch it
[56:45] they're blind to that they need to sit
[56:46] right here and if they fall off they're
[56:48] going to hurt their head they're blind
[56:49] to that you might be a Christian and
[56:52] function as a Christian but you could be
[56:53] blind as a bat
[56:57] but he that lack these things is blind
[56:58] and cannot see a far off and hath
[57:02] forgotten sometimes we do we
[57:04] forget that we were purged from these
[57:06] old
[57:07] sins wherefore the rather their Brethren
[57:09] give diligence to make your calling and
[57:12] election sure for if you do these things
[57:15] you shall never fall now that's a that's
[57:17] just as much a promise that's thus
[57:19] sayith the Lord amen cuz God wrote it in
[57:21] the Bible That's Right everything is
[57:23] thus sayith the Lord in the Bible
[57:25] that's so through Peter he says you
[57:28] shall never
[57:29] fall amen for so an entrance shall be
[57:32] ministered unto you look that entrance
[57:35] is this message of the
[57:38] hour that entrance is what you stepped
[57:40] into because you open the door and let
[57:44] Christ
[57:45] in so there's an entrance ministered
[57:47] unto you abundantly in the Everlasting
[57:49] Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[57:50] Christ now that's not a kingdom over
[57:53] there what he say your kingdom is
[57:56] within wherefore I will not be negligent
[57:58] to put you always in remembrance of
[58:00] these things 136
[58:04] sermons we're all a little slow we're
[58:06] Southerners but we're
[58:07] okay though you know them look though
[58:10] you know them and be established in
[58:11] present day
[58:15] truth so Matthew 17:5 and we know that
[58:19] in the first part of Matthew when Jesus
[58:20] went to the river and was baptized there
[58:23] was a Dove came down and
[58:25] and there was a voice that said this is
[58:27] my beloved Son in whom I pleased to
[58:29] dwell right didn't say here ye him at
[58:32] that time he had some growth to do cuz
[58:34] the Bible says he grew in Grace and
[58:36] knowledge the Bible said he had to have
[58:38] a mountain
[58:40] experience he had to come to
[58:43] adoption so now this is Matthew 17 he's
[58:46] up on top of the mountain Behold The
[58:47] Voice come out of the cloud which said
[58:49] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleas
[58:50] I'm well pleased hear ye him in other
[58:54] words I have identified where I am well
[58:56] listen God through a prophet identified
[58:59] that his bride is him yes amen not a
[59:02] second person the bride is him
[59:05] yes the voice of the bride and the voice
[59:08] of the bridegroom is the same yes if
[59:10] it's not you were out
[59:12] bride cu the bridegroom's voice is
[59:14] always going to be the same it's just
[59:17] the bride's voice has got to be the same
[59:20] as the
[59:20] bridegroom Luke 9:33 says it came to
[59:23] pass as they departed from him Peter S
[59:26] un to Jesus Master it is good for us to
[59:29] be here and let us set up a trinitarian
[59:33] Doctrine let make three Tabernacles one
[59:36] for you one for Moses one for Elijah not
[59:39] knowing look not knowing what he
[59:41] said he got
[59:43] excited he just blurred it out that's
[59:46] Peter you
[59:48] know the same guy that wrote about these
[59:51] a little later when he got the Holy
[59:52] Ghost he didn't have the Holy Ghost here
[59:55] while he thus spake God cut him off
[59:58] while he thus spake there came a cloud
[59:59] and overshadowed them and they feared as
[1:00:01] they entered the cloud and there came a
[1:00:03] voice out of the cloud saying this is my
[1:00:05] beloved Son hear him and when the voice
[1:00:08] was passed Jesus was found alone and
[1:00:11] they kept it close and told no man in
[1:00:14] those days any of those things which
[1:00:16] they had
[1:00:18] seen brother R did the same
[1:00:21] thing he went I this is what I believe
[1:00:25] he went up on a mountain and he was
[1:00:29] adopted a
[1:00:31] cloud that was a voice spoke through
[1:00:33] that cloud said go back to Jefferson
[1:00:35] bille these seals will be given to you
[1:00:37] there the seals weren't revealed to him
[1:00:39] in Tucson they were revealed to him in
[1:00:41] Jeffersonville all right he said go back
[1:00:44] and these things will be made known to
[1:00:46] you to me that's when I believe that
[1:00:48] brother brownon was adopted and then he
[1:00:51] said hear ye him because listen then
[1:00:53] then why not will you say well how can
[1:00:55] you establish that how many people
[1:00:57] preached the truth of the seals in
[1:01:01] 1963 that's what I thought nobody oh
[1:01:04] Clarence Lin they said oh clar you see
[1:01:06] that they got that junk on online now
[1:01:08] where where brother Brown stole it from
[1:01:10] Clarence
[1:01:12] Lin Clarence Lin might have been a good
[1:01:15] man he might have been a holy ghost fi
[1:01:16] preacher but he wasn't a
[1:01:18] prophet he wasn't an identified Church
[1:01:21] age messenger in the Bible right and he
[1:01:24] just preached the seals and then went on
[1:01:27] brother R preached the seals and I
[1:01:29] believe it opened up to us it was for
[1:01:31] this bride this end time bride sir not
[1:01:34] the one back there this one cuz he says
[1:01:37] right here in questions and answers on
[1:01:39] the seals now this is he's preached
[1:01:40] first seal second seal third fourth
[1:01:42] fifth and six seals he's preached six
[1:01:44] seals he's getting ready to preach the
[1:01:46] seventh that afternoon or that evening
[1:01:48] all right so he has questions and
[1:01:50] answers cuz remember always between a
[1:01:51] 600 and a 7 there's an interval we'll
[1:01:53] preach on that
[1:01:55] maybe a little bit
[1:01:57] later I know that you don't see
[1:02:01] it cuz see there was no one adopted
[1:02:03] during that time brother Ram is standing
[1:02:05] on a level that no one had stood on
[1:02:08] since that time of
[1:02:10] Christ everybody with
[1:02:13] me I'm identifying where God is Not That
[1:02:17] William Brandon was God no way he is a
[1:02:20] sinner just like me and you born in sin
[1:02:22] shapen in iniquity had to be born again
[1:02:24] yes right but he was a church age
[1:02:26] messenger he was identified in the Bible
[1:02:28] and I don't care what man says if the
[1:02:31] Bible said that's who it was that's good
[1:02:33] enough for me all right but he said I
[1:02:36] know that you don't see it I'm just
[1:02:38] positive you don't see
[1:02:40] it remember tell this Vision to no one
[1:02:43] until the son of man be risen again I
[1:02:44] didn't read that but Jesus said that
[1:02:46] going down the mountain he said look hey
[1:02:47] don't tell this to nobody until the son
[1:02:49] of man be risen
[1:02:51] again well he rose the first time 2,000
[1:02:54] years ago when's he going to rise again
[1:02:57] in the end time in a bride The Headstone
[1:03:00] us as being the collective body brings
[1:03:04] The Headstone back we'll get into that a
[1:03:05] little bit
[1:03:06] later but I'm positive you don't see it
[1:03:08] you say brother R that's a hard thing to
[1:03:10] say I know it is but look let me just
[1:03:12] say this now I suppose this is just tape
[1:03:14] for oursel well it went all over the
[1:03:16] world but let me say this that you don't
[1:03:19] get
[1:03:21] it and you're not supposed to get it
[1:03:26] and you're not supposed to get it so
[1:03:27] he's not frustrated sure he's frustrated
[1:03:30] in his Humanity but he's not frustrated
[1:03:32] that it's just going to be words just
[1:03:33] going to be thrown out
[1:03:35] somewhere he knows it's the word of God
[1:03:38] the greatest thing since Jesus was on
[1:03:41] Earth he's fixing to open those seals
[1:03:43] all right back in now he's preached six
[1:03:45] of them he sees that it's the greatest
[1:03:47] Ministry that he'd ever had the most
[1:03:49] anointing he'd ever had and they're just
[1:03:51] sitting there going can I wear panty
[1:03:54] hose
[1:03:56] can I wear pajamas to
[1:03:58] bed and several of the questions two
[1:04:01] questions was on the seals the rest of
[1:04:02] them were not one of them was on water
[1:04:05] baptism and you know what brother rham
[1:04:06] in his in his in his Humanity he
[1:04:09] probably was rolling his eyes but in his
[1:04:11] in his pastoral work as a prophet he
[1:04:14] answered it just like he answered it 10
[1:04:17] years ago 20 years ago he answered it he
[1:04:19] didn't say like some of us AG go hey you
[1:04:22] ought to know this by now no he took it
[1:04:24] and he answered
[1:04:26] it about water baptism that he preached
[1:04:28] for years and years and he answered the
[1:04:30] question what about water baptism and
[1:04:32] all the different things that's why he
[1:04:33] saw that they didn't get it but look he
[1:04:36] says look you're not supposed to get it
[1:04:37] so don't try to interpret it man tried
[1:04:39] to do that don't try to put your
[1:04:41] interpretation to it you only get
[1:04:43] further away that's what man's done
[1:04:46] they've got further away from the word
[1:04:47] of God by not being what in the word for
[1:04:52] their hour Hallelujah
[1:04:55] as brother Vernon was talking about the
[1:04:56] continuity of the word means that that
[1:04:58] word is moving and it's moving from from
[1:05:02] dispensation to dispensation this is now
[1:05:04] the dispensation to get out of here this
[1:05:07] is a dispensation when The Headstone
[1:05:09] will speak it will speak through a bride
[1:05:12] and it will not speak through one
[1:05:14] person we've had that one person but
[1:05:17] it'll be a many membered body somebody's
[1:05:19] going to catch it may not be but three
[1:05:21] people or four or two but somebody's
[1:05:25] going to get
[1:05:26] this take my advice if you believe me
[1:05:29] now if God has given me favor in your
[1:05:31] sight you know that them Revelations are
[1:05:33] things I've been here with you a long
[1:05:34] time and it's always been right and now
[1:05:36] to double prove it right it hooks right
[1:05:38] in with the word so you know it's thus
[1:05:41] sayth the Lord that's exactly it's
[1:05:42] proved to you now take my advice as your
[1:05:45] brother don't put your own
[1:05:46] interpretation to anything you just go
[1:05:48] on live a good now he didn't say that
[1:05:49] weren't
[1:05:51] Christians he didn't say well bless God
[1:05:53] you all lost you ain't getting what I'm
[1:05:55] saying so you're lost no they're
[1:05:57] Christians they're Christians for a
[1:05:59] dispensation that the door or the book
[1:06:02] wasn't open to
[1:06:05] them don't put your own interpretation
[1:06:07] to anything you just go on and live a
[1:06:08] good Christian Life CU you'll only wind
[1:06:11] yourself away from the real thing when
[1:06:13] you do so there must be a real
[1:06:16] thing and they will wind their yourself
[1:06:18] away from the real thing all right
[1:06:20] you'll only wind your way again away
[1:06:23] from the thing
[1:06:25] and all of you are conscious that know
[1:06:27] that there's something mysterious
[1:06:28] happening and it's happening and I know
[1:06:30] what it is in other words the opening of
[1:06:31] the seals was the Revelation that had
[1:06:34] been hid since Jesus left the earth now
[1:06:38] I'm not saying that it's the grace of
[1:06:40] God that lets me know what it is it's
[1:06:41] something that's tremendous and it's
[1:06:43] gone right now and there's no way in the
[1:06:45] world for you to see it but so help me
[1:06:47] with this Bible in my hand I know what
[1:06:49] it is it was for
[1:06:52] us amen it was closed to them open to us
[1:06:57] just like I tell you many times some
[1:06:58] people man told me one time he said the
[1:07:01] seventh seal is not open I said okay
[1:07:03] that's
[1:07:04] fine to
[1:07:06] you to you it may not be open because
[1:07:10] you're confessing that it's not but to
[1:07:11] me it's open right so the seven seal is
[1:07:14] not open Le you understand
[1:07:17] it Hebrews 5:10 called of God and high
[1:07:20] priest after the order of mezc of whom
[1:07:22] we have many things to say and Hardy
[1:07:24] uttered seeing you look see you're dull
[1:07:25] of hearing I read that because that's
[1:07:27] what brother R was telling those people
[1:07:29] you're dull of hearing but this is not
[1:07:30] for you he so gracious to say look this
[1:07:32] is not for you in other words it's not
[1:07:35] going to return void though it's going
[1:07:36] to accomplish there's going to be a
[1:07:39] generation how many of us were born in
[1:07:41] 1963 prior
[1:07:45] to right
[1:07:48] amen it was for
[1:07:50] us and all y'all just born after if not
[1:07:53] it would have closed the book The Seal
[1:07:54] would have open they'd have took a
[1:07:55] Rapture him we'd have never been here
[1:07:57] but that's not what God saw before the
[1:07:59] foundation of the world he saw a group
[1:08:01] of people that would sit here and even
[1:08:03] though they sit here and they do this
[1:08:04] and they they try to understand what's
[1:08:06] going on some of the young ones you're
[1:08:08] still here yes you're here listening and
[1:08:12] I believe the spirit speaks to everybody
[1:08:14] individually at your own
[1:08:18] level cuz he will not leave you or
[1:08:21] forsake you so he's going to talk to you
[1:08:23] in your your terms if you'll
[1:08:25] listen but remember Paul's going to tell
[1:08:29] us here in a minute for when the time we
[1:08:31] ought to be teachers we have need that
[1:08:33] one teach you again the first principles
[1:08:35] of the Oracles of God in other words
[1:08:38] what a baptism no eternal hell all these
[1:08:40] different things but there is time for
[1:08:42] that and we need to Circle back sometime
[1:08:44] remember I told you the Lord told me a
[1:08:45] couple years ago that he's not going to
[1:08:47] leave anybody behind that wants to catch
[1:08:49] up so this is the catching up Time Each
[1:08:52] past two years was a catch catching up
[1:08:54] time if you didn't catch up in these
[1:08:55] last two years then we're heading toward
[1:08:57] the coming of the Lord so your Gap is a
[1:08:59] lot close mine too our Gap is a lot
[1:09:02] closer than it was two years ago all
[1:09:05] right for when for the time you ought to
[1:09:07] be teachers you have need that one teach
[1:09:09] you again would be the first principles
[1:09:10] the Oracles of God and are become such
[1:09:13] as have need of milk and not of strong
[1:09:14] meat in other words he's sitting there
[1:09:16] looking at adults that should be adults
[1:09:18] that should be eating meat and they're
[1:09:19] drinking drinking milk that's what
[1:09:21] brother randam was doing see Paul and
[1:09:23] brother r if you took their
[1:09:25] life remember I did that years and years
[1:09:27] and years ago take uh
[1:09:31] Moses
[1:09:33] Jesus Paul and brother brandham and you
[1:09:36] put their lives together and pretty much
[1:09:38] they're the same amen all right pretty
[1:09:41] much I said Moses had an experience with
[1:09:43] a burning
[1:09:45] bush Jesus had an
[1:09:48] experience Paul had an experience on the
[1:09:50] Damascus Road and brother Bram had an
[1:09:53] experience with with a voice talking to
[1:09:54] him up in a tree there's a light hanging
[1:09:56] over him at his
[1:09:58] birth I just pray there's a light inside
[1:10:00] of you that can understand
[1:10:02] it for everyone that uses milk is
[1:10:05] unskillful now it doesn't say you're
[1:10:07] lost like I said before he didn't say
[1:10:09] those people were lost they were
[1:10:12] unskillful listen to be adopted you have
[1:10:14] to be skillful right cuz you can't say
[1:10:17] something to miss because you then you
[1:10:19] have so much power in your voice power
[1:10:22] without character
[1:10:24] it's satanic that's what we've been
[1:10:25] preaching on the power is there but get
[1:10:29] everything together before you speak
[1:10:31] because what you
[1:10:37] say for everyone that uses milk is
[1:10:40] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:10:42] for he's a babe didn't say he wasn't
[1:10:44] born he was a
[1:10:46] babe but strong meat belongeth to them
[1:10:48] that are of full age even those who by
[1:10:50] reason of
[1:10:52] use
[1:10:54] do we use the word of God we're given to
[1:10:57] its fullest extent I want to ask you
[1:10:58] that
[1:10:59] today I
[1:11:01] don't and that don't mean we have to be
[1:11:03] God zombies do you understand what I
[1:11:05] mean we're human
[1:11:07] beings right we're human
[1:11:09] beings but we should spend more time
[1:11:12] with the Lord than we do with Facebook
[1:11:14] and this book and that book
[1:11:20] and nothing listen nothing wrong with it
[1:11:23] if there's nothing wrong with anything
[1:11:25] Harley if you use it right because the
[1:11:27] communication we all communicate through
[1:11:29] WhatsApp well you let's throw it away no
[1:11:31] brother no don't throw it away but don't
[1:11:34] be sitting there back and forth for
[1:11:35] three or four hours with each other yeah

[1:12:34] memory reasoning conscious affection
[1:12:36] imagination that's your reasoning Factor
[1:12:38] that's your senses that God works
[1:12:41] through and Satan Works through both

[1:13:57] memory if we keep thinking about the
[1:13:59] stuff we used to do come on
[1:14:04] somebody I thought when we got born
[1:14:06] again that was thrown in the sea of
[1:14:07] forgetfulness and God don't remember it
[1:14:08] no more why keep bringing it back up to
[1:14:11] it you're wasting his time and
[1:14:16] yours that's why you got to put it down
[1:14:18] and say I'm born again this is the day
[1:14:21] whatever happened back this way
[1:14:23] if God thought enough of me to birth me
[1:14:25] into his body then he thought enough of
[1:14:28] me to clear my Slate from their
[1:14:31] back Bob ready it brother Bob look poer

[1:15:04] this amen and it's the word of God for
[1:15:07] your day amen they might have not back
[1:15:10] in Luther's day they couldn't get all
[1:15:12] the way out that's what the prophet of
[1:15:13] God kept saying they didn't nobody
[1:15:14] understood that he said they couldn't
[1:15:16] get all the way out Luther couldn't get
[1:15:18] all the way out get out of what get out
[1:15:20] of that
[1:15:21] denomination get out of that false
[1:15:24] teaching he couldn't get all the way
[1:15:27] out we are all the way out yes
[1:15:31] sir if you'll accept
[1:15:39] it there's where God's trying to get his
[1:15:41] church just say to this mountain be
[1:15:44] moved and it'll move
[1:15:46] Authority sons of God the whole creation
[1:15:48] is groaning and waiting for the
[1:15:49] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[1:15:51] to a spot to where that the the sickness
[1:15:53] will be a
[1:15:56] arise and it will be that
[1:15:58] way the blind will receive their sight
[1:16:01] de and done we pray for them
[1:16:03] now but then you'll command
[1:16:08] it what you quiet
[1:16:11] for can y'all say Amen to
[1:16:16] that don't be don't fear right I'm no
[1:16:20] longer a what slave
[1:16:23] to fear I'm a Child of
[1:16:27] God the blind will receive their sight
[1:16:29] deaf and dumb we pray for them now but
[1:16:31] then you'll command it didn't say these
[1:16:34] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:16:35] they shall pray for the sick he said
[1:16:36] they shall cast out devils not I will
[1:16:38] they will if you say to this mountain
[1:16:41] not if I say if you say to this mountain
[1:16:44] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:16:45] you know listen that I know brother
[1:16:47] Brandon couldn't have lived this long
[1:16:48] cuz he'd been like hund and something
[1:16:50] years old but God took him the time he
[1:16:52] was supposed to take take him cuz
[1:16:53] remember God's perfect did somebody say
[1:16:55] that not too long ago God's perfect his
[1:16:57] timing is perfect he took that Prophet
[1:16:59] off the scene because if that Prophet
[1:17:00] was here today guess what we'd
[1:17:02] be we'd be looking at the
[1:17:05] prophet but now we look to Jesus Christ
[1:17:08] that's who he introduced us to John said
[1:17:10] look I'm
[1:17:12] nothing here's the one you need to look
[1:17:15] at like we were talking about the other
[1:17:17] day about church ages in the Old
[1:17:19] Testament John was the last one of the
[1:17:21] church age he was the hinge pin he he
[1:17:23] was the the one that had the Old
[1:17:25] Testament and New Testament John had the
[1:17:27] spirit of Elijah somebody say Amen so
[1:17:30] what did he do he turned her heart back
[1:17:33] and introduced Christ then you start the
[1:17:35] new church ages the church ages in the
[1:17:37] New Testament you go all the way through
[1:17:38] it the very end who shows up Elijah
[1:17:42] shows up again amen and a little Prophet
[1:17:45] that turns us back Hallelujah and says
[1:17:48] that's
[1:17:50] him she is but then he brings it all
[1:17:53] back together he says she is
[1:17:56] him then it's not him over there it's
[1:17:59] him
[1:18:00] here but how can the church the
[1:18:02] Pentecostal church and the Methodist
[1:18:04] Baptist be adopted until they come to
[1:18:10] discipline we've got to be disciplined
[1:18:14] first God could not trust this power
[1:18:17] with the church it's hard to tell what
[1:18:20] you would do power without character all
[1:18:24] right how could a father trust his
[1:18:26] business to a boy that might simply
[1:18:28] pollute his whole inheritance he
[1:18:30] couldn't do it the church has got to
[1:18:33] come to a place to where it's
[1:18:34] disciplined God's on that God's on that
[1:18:37] work right now discipline
[1:18:41] right because you know listen there's
[1:18:44] fathers can turn their businesses over
[1:18:46] to sons and if you look in the world
[1:18:49] usually it's a
[1:18:51] disaster seen it many times myself that
[1:18:55] the son takes over for the father
[1:18:57] business and it's a disaster why they
[1:18:59] don't have the same ethics and all that
[1:19:01] stuff I'm talking about in the world but
[1:19:03] we bring it here and said how can a
[1:19:04] father trust his business with a boy
[1:19:06] that might simply pollute his whole
[1:19:08] inheritance he couldn't do that the
[1:19:10] church has got to come to a place so
[1:19:11] there's got to be like I said
[1:19:14] predetermined Destiny of a group of
[1:19:16] people to be adopted that's right can't
[1:19:20] get away from it but you can plug
[1:19:21] yourself into it all right
[1:19:24] God's on that work right now
[1:19:27] discipline that's why I say and I agree
[1:19:32] that we have had a
[1:19:33] pastor that has taught us adoption more
[1:19:36] than anybody I've ever heard in my
[1:19:38] life so he's got us in a mindset of that
[1:19:43] so let's carry on with it all
[1:19:46] right let's carry on with
[1:19:49] it yes sir Romans 8: 21 will stop right
[1:19:52] here because the the creature itself
[1:19:53] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:19:55] of corruption look in bondage in God
[1:19:59] there is no bondage now Paul was a
[1:20:02] prisoner of
[1:20:04] Christ but he wasn't
[1:20:07] bound you know even in his even in his
[1:20:09] incarceration they let him move around
[1:20:11] he didn't he wasn't bound up they he
[1:20:13] wrote many of his letters while he was
[1:20:16] sitting in
[1:20:16] prison maybe we ought to try that don't
[1:20:18] get in real
[1:20:20] prison because the creature itself also
[1:20:22] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:20:24] corruption and the Glorious Liberty of
[1:20:25] the what the children of God for we know
[1:20:28] all right we
[1:20:29] know all right so now stop right there
[1:20:32] we
[1:20:32] know we know all these things seals have
[1:20:37] been open trumpets vs plagues Thunders
[1:20:43] all the great Mysteries of the Bible
[1:20:44] Books
[1:20:46] open for we
[1:20:48] know then we know that the whole
[1:20:51] creation
[1:20:53] granth and travaileth in pain together
[1:20:56] look what Paul said until
[1:20:59] now he brings it present day but Paul
[1:21:02] was not predestinated to
[1:21:05] adoption he preached about it told us
[1:21:08] that we were but he never came to it
[1:21:10] that I understand that he came to
[1:21:11] adoption all right now he had Authority
[1:21:14] sure he did but to come to the end time
[1:21:17] adoption cuz we predestinated in the end
[1:21:19] time to come to adoption to get the
[1:21:22] people out of the grave that's Paul
[1:21:24] number irenius remember all that now
[1:21:29] watch and not only
[1:21:32] they but ourselves also amen which have
[1:21:35] the first fruits of the spirit all right
[1:21:38] we've got the first fruits but you and I
[1:21:40] have the Harvest Time Coming we've had
[1:21:42] the latter rain but we got the Harvest
[1:21:45] rain now that's going to what Harvest a
[1:21:47] group of people off the face of the
[1:21:49] Earth everybody with me that's me and
[1:21:50] you but you got to come to maturity
[1:21:54] if I would have made corn this year and
[1:21:55] the deer hun destroyed it it would have
[1:21:58] come to maturity and I'd have got it out
[1:22:00] of the
[1:22:02] garden not
[1:22:04] before the deer thought
[1:22:06] before we saw a bunch of them out in the
[1:22:09] field the other day they took a picture
[1:22:10] and sent it to us a bunch of them 15 or
[1:22:12] 16 16 of them out there in the field I
[1:22:14] said There goes my
[1:22:16] garden I'll get one or two of them we'll
[1:22:18] figure out way to get that I'll get some
[1:22:21] of my garden back
