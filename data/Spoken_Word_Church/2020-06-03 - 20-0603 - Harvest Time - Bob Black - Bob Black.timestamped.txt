[3:11] I was really surprised that all the cars

[3:17] wants to come to church praise the Lord
[3:22] [Applause]
[3:25] you know it's just it's getting kind of
[3:28] crazy out out there you know Louie in
[3:30] the news and all the things happening
[3:31] and everything and remember the
[3:34] beginning of this year all these wild
[3:36] fires and things is like the whole earth
[3:38] was on fire and things just keep
[3:41] stacking up almost I'm ready to get out
[3:44] here you gotta we got to get out of here
[3:50] but there there is a way that God has
[3:53] provided so I just want to take a look
[3:55] at that tonight and good to see all your
[3:57] smiling bright eyes and faces and all
[4:00] that tonight ready ready to get into the
[4:03] wound so so we're gonna read tonight
[4:06] from Matthew chapter 4 verses 2 to 4 and
[4:08] and then kind of on further down that
[4:10] that chapter but we'll start with
[4:12] Matthew Matthew chapter 4 verses 2 to 4
[4:18] testing testing good let's go to the
[4:26] Lord in prayer
[4:27] well God we're so grateful to be able to
[4:29] gather together and look into your word
[4:31] tonight or when we pray Lord I my prayer
[4:33] is that someone will be strengthened
[4:35] Lord that like that we sung that song
[4:36] tonight Lord that our eyes will be open
[4:39] Lord Jesus to see the day in the hour
[4:41] that we're living in to and him to be
[4:43] able to look into the mystery that's
[4:44] been hidden from generations and and
[4:46] there's now revealed to the Gentiles
[4:48] this thing that's been hidden Lord God I
[4:50] but now I believe that the veil has been
[4:51] torn off of it so that we can see
[4:54] plainly who we are who you are and and
[4:58] what what's going on in these days I
[5:00] pray God the night that you'll just
[5:02] build our faith and strengthen this Lord
[5:04] Jesus so that when we leave Lord
[5:05] there'll be a spring and our step and a
[5:07] song in our heart knowing Lord Jesus
[5:09] that you care for us that you're there
[5:11] for us that you provided for us
[5:13] you've given us a way of escape you made
[5:16] a way for us know Jesus we thank you for
[5:18] these things we ask Lord that you'll now
[5:19] open the word to
[5:20] so when the open our eyes will God and
[5:22] give us understanding we pray in your
[5:24] name Amen so Matthew chapter 4 verses 2
[5:30] to 4 and tonight I'm just gonna speak on
[5:32] a little topic of the harvest time and
[5:34] it says and when he had fasted forty
[5:37] days and forty nights he was afterward
[5:38] an hungred and when the tempter came to
[5:41] him he said if thou be the Son of God
[5:43] command that these stones be made bread
[5:45] but he answered and said it is written
[5:47] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[5:51] every word that proceedeth out of the
[5:53] mouth of God you may be seated the Lord
[5:56] I listen to the reading of the work so
[5:59] we'll find that you know in in this
[6:02] sermon I'm kind of once again preaching
[6:05] off of the sermon that brother brand
[6:06] priest so if you have any questions
[6:08] about the doctrine or the way that it's
[6:10] presented go listen to that service go
[6:12] listen to the harvest time so again I
[6:14] wanted to be saying it well brother
[6:16] Bob's preaching exactly what the
[6:18] prophecy he said say what I said so I'm
[6:21] just gonna take it my brother Bob you
[6:24] cheatin you're just taking your notes
[6:25] right out of the message I would that we
[6:28] at all cheating this way so you know
[6:33] when brother Branham was was a again you
[6:36] know I believe that the fivefold
[6:38] ministry was to take the big big golden
[6:41] nuggets that brother Branham preached
[6:43] and break them down into easily
[6:44] digestible chunks so that we could say
[6:46] oh I can digest that I can I can I can
[6:49] eat that now I can see now we can see
[6:52] that it's not just a message to kind of
[6:55] leave on in the back and and listen to
[6:56] it with with with kind of your eyes
[6:58] closed but maybe we could pull out some
[7:00] things that brother Branham would say in
[7:02] these sermons that would really identify
[7:04] something that's almost been mysterious
[7:07] as you listen to the messages you come
[7:09] to church you know many times it's the
[7:11] message seems real mysterious and it
[7:14] seems complicated and everything but if
[7:16] you just sit down and and just meditate
[7:18] on the word and meditate on the things
[7:20] that the Prophet is saying that the
[7:21] ministries are preaching it will slowly
[7:23] begin to open up to you and become as
[7:26] simple as can be as simple as as
[7:28] planting a little a little a little corn
[7:31] wheat in the ground and it grows and it
[7:33] grows into grooves and it come till it
[7:34] comes up and the same thing is there
[7:36] that was planted now you say well that's
[7:39] that's really simple we now you've made
[7:40] it too simple there's a lot of there's a
[7:42] lot of things in there there's a lot of
[7:44] things in between there that that we
[7:46] focus with a brother Brian preached to
[7:48] when he was preaching all these sermons
[7:49] to build our faith and to allow us to
[7:52] see this mystery this thing that's
[7:55] revealed in the harvest now one thing
[7:59] that's very interesting is that when
[8:01] brother Brown would preach these things
[8:03] or explain these things to us we
[8:05] realized that that that the devil's
[8:07] tactics never change and the way that
[8:10] God that God approaches things never
[8:12] changes either because he's Hebrews 13:8
[8:14] he's the same yesterday today and
[8:16] forever and the way that God moves
[8:18] things the way that he started and it
[8:20] started the whole creation the way that
[8:22] he he put brings things into existence
[8:24] the way he changes you the way he
[8:26] changes your mind it's all by the word
[8:29] by the spoken word and we know that the
[8:32] word is the expression of who he is the
[8:34] beginning he spoke the word the word
[8:36] came out from the Father like that
[8:37] little the pillar of fire and he began
[8:39] to speak the word because the word is
[8:41] the expression of the of the father the
[8:43] word is who that is expressed and he
[8:46] began to speak and said let there be and
[8:49] out from him came came matter and all
[8:51] these different kind of things and he
[8:54] created the world with his word well
[8:56] he's doing that exact same thing here
[8:59] tonight every time we come to church as
[9:00] the word goes for the word is not just
[9:03] some something that will go forth and
[9:05] just fall to the ground or something
[9:07] that just just floats away but it
[9:09] actually is accomplishing something it
[9:11] will accomplish its purpose as the Bible
[9:13] says it will renata not return to God
[9:15] void without having done something when
[9:18] the word goes forth it actually produces
[9:19] a change and it will produce a change in
[9:22] your life now that's maybe something
[9:25] difficult for a little baby to
[9:26] understand a little newborn baby in
[9:28] Christ to understand that the word is
[9:30] what will change you because when you
[9:32] come to the to the to the Lord you're
[9:34] looking for great big signs and wonders
[9:36] and all these kind of things maybe but
[9:37] it's the simplicity of the preaching of
[9:39] the gospel of the foolishness of the
[9:41] preaching of the gospel as Paul would
[9:42] say that
[9:44] that is actually transforming our mind
[9:46] Trent renewing our mind to changing us
[9:49] so that we we we are open it activates
[9:54] the spirit it provides a way for the
[9:56] spirit to come and quicken us and change
[9:58] us and and mold us into the image of
[10:00] that original seed which was the spoken
[10:03] word the spoken word is the original
[10:05] seed the original seed is what was
[10:07] planted when Christ died and was planted
[10:10] in the ground the original seed is what
[10:12] was lost down through the seven churches
[10:14] but the original seed is coming back so
[10:18] so as we can see the word is is there's
[10:22] really there's really two two kinds of
[10:24] break it is what brother Brian was
[10:25] pretty bringing out in this message
[10:27] there's two kinds of bread and I believe
[10:29] he preached this on the communion Sunday
[10:31] so that we're eating the communion bread
[10:33] and he said there was there's he made a
[10:35] point in here and I this is one of the
[10:37] things I want to just kind of bring out
[10:38] that there's two kind of bread there's
[10:40] natural bread and their spiritual bread
[10:42] and there's natural but a lot of times
[10:44] the devil what kind of will kind of
[10:46] throw some natural bread in front of you
[10:48] like every as we kind of study in this
[10:51] message that's one of the things that he
[10:52] said the devil did through Eve in the
[10:55] Garden of Eden was he tried to feed she
[10:57] tried to feed Adam some natural bread
[10:59] but that that natural bread when you go
[11:03] sit at your shuttle to supper table or
[11:05] whatever that'll feed your body it'll
[11:07] feed your flesh it'll feed your natural
[11:09] bread good old bread that you buy the
[11:11] grocery store it's got living in it and
[11:13] all that kind of stuff the things that
[11:15] you put in your mouth that will feed
[11:17] your body but there's only one thing
[11:20] that will feed your soul there's only
[11:22] one thing that will feed your soul and
[11:24] it's not natural bread it's not things
[11:26] to this world it's not things that that
[11:28] will make your flesh feel good it's not
[11:30] anything that will make your spirit
[11:32] happy there's only one thing that will
[11:34] feed your soul and that is the Word of
[11:36] God
[11:36] now now tonight see how simple it is
[11:39] that's that's really the way of escape
[11:41] for us that's the way that God has
[11:43] provided for us to get out of here as we
[11:45] see the world on fire all these thing
[11:47] people going crazy in the streets
[11:48] protesting all these things people can't
[11:50] can't get in one Accord
[11:52] we got racists fighting against one
[11:54] another and everybody's hating one
[11:56] another
[11:56] all these kind of things but yeah
[11:58] there's a little group of people who are
[11:59] catching the revelation that God had
[12:02] predestinated you to hear before the
[12:03] foundation of the world and he's
[12:05] changing you from the inside out
[12:07] catching you molding you so that that
[12:09] corn of wheat can be called away and the
[12:11] harvest and the great harvest that's
[12:14] what we're looking for is the harvest
[12:15] time and how do you know how do you know
[12:17] when the harvest is coming I'm really
[12:19] jumping around in my nose now how do you
[12:22] know how do you know when that harvest
[12:24] is almost attained do you know when the
[12:25] harvest is and bye-bye people going
[12:28] crazy in the streets well people have
[12:29] always been going crazy if you look at
[12:31] history you can read pol pot and how
[12:34] Joseph Stalin kill all those people and
[12:36] all down through history horrible things
[12:38] have happened that's not a sign that
[12:40] something is about to happen the sign
[12:42] that something is about that the harvest
[12:43] is about to take place is when you see
[12:45] the tares and the wheat ripening when
[12:48] you see the tears and the weed both
[12:49] coming up to ripening then you know that
[12:51] the harvest is at hand so look at
[12:53] yourself and examine yourself maybe
[12:55] tonight and see do I see the Word of God
[12:57] being ripened in my life because it's
[13:00] certainly being ripened in others
[13:02] maybe it's examination time tonight to
[13:05] be able to look at ourselves and say do
[13:06] I do I see the Word of God being made
[13:09] manifest in my life or have I just kind
[13:11] of been dilly dally in all these years
[13:13] maybe it's time for me to get busy with
[13:15] the Lord and busy with the word and get
[13:17] into the Bible and begin to understand
[13:19] the things that have been laying there
[13:20] all this time you know the Word of God
[13:23] is not a museum for us to go in and look
[13:25] at the world the message takes behind a
[13:27] wall of glass and say well look at there
[13:29] ain't that great that brother bran
[13:30] preached all these things in there in
[13:32] that fantastic but it's there for us to
[13:34] get into and dig in and find these
[13:36] little nuggets and things that will
[13:37] build our faith because the Word of God
[13:40] is the only meat for the soul it is the
[13:42] only thing that will change you it will
[13:45] actually transform you and renew you you
[13:48] see you see what where where does bread
[13:50] come from is you begin to meditate on
[13:51] that on that where does this kind of in
[13:55] the natural bread bread in the natural
[13:57] world bread comes from wheat that has
[14:01] been ground up with the little birds and
[14:03] baked in an oven and made into something
[14:05] well now in the spiritual sense
[14:09] Jesus Christ had to die on the cross his
[14:11] body was was ground up brother Aaron
[14:13] said it looked like hamburger meat Oh on
[14:14] the cross he he gave his life and he and
[14:17] he went down into the ground so that we
[14:19] could eat the body word of the Son of
[14:22] Man in this day so now when brother
[14:25] Branham was preaching this sermon he he
[14:26] began he really started off he started
[14:28] off with reading Matthew 4 but then he
[14:30] just jumped over to John chapter 6 verse
[14:32] 44 to 58 and it's very interesting let's
[14:36] go ahead and pull that up it's very
[14:37] interesting that he would begin to pull
[14:39] this because as we know as we're taught
[14:41] that the third pool is the opening of
[14:42] the world and this was in Jesus's third
[14:44] pool the the phase of his ministry of
[14:46] the third pool because he began to
[14:48] really open up the word and begin to
[14:49] preach to people things that were very
[14:52] mysterious so I want to stress again
[14:54] tonight if you begin to study the
[14:56] message and begin to hear things that
[14:57] are very mysterious as you're coming
[14:59] along don't get discouraged because
[15:00] these people these disciples they heard
[15:02] these same kind of the things that Jesus
[15:04] I'm gonna read to you right now they
[15:05] were very discouraged maybe that one in
[15:08] the world a lot of people just turned
[15:09] around and left and that's what brother
[15:12] Branham was getting at in this message
[15:13] don't don't let the things that you
[15:16] don't understand discourage you don't
[15:18] look at natural things and be
[15:19] discouraged but just keep walking on
[15:21] just keep hang on hang on to that word
[15:24] hold old to it and by-and-by
[15:26] it will open up to you and you will
[15:28] begin to understand John chapter 6 verse
[15:32] 44 says no man could come unto me except
[15:34] the Father which just sent me draw me
[15:36] and I will raise him up at the last day
[15:40] now isn't that an interesting statement
[15:42] that no man can come to me except the
[15:46] Father which I sent me draw him you know
[15:49] III think about that a lot when I think
[15:51] about the young people everything you
[15:53] know you can you can sit down with your
[15:54] kids and you can berate them and tell
[15:56] you why don't you shape up and all this
[15:58] kind of thing and they ain't gonna come
[15:59] to the Lord but I tell you what when the
[16:00] father begins to draw up they're gonna
[16:01] come they're gonna come runnin and so
[16:07] you see the way to get your children to
[16:09] the Lord is not to not to fuss at them
[16:11] and yell at them and all these kind of
[16:12] things but you turn the father loose on
[16:14] them and he'll draw them he'll put them
[16:16] through the wringer or whatever he needs
[16:17] to do and all of a sudden you'll begin
[16:18] to soften up their heart and something
[16:20] will begin to change
[16:21] and I know it's the truth I know it's a
[16:24] fact because if you see the father is
[16:25] doing something that you cannot do he's
[16:28] drunk he's you can't get in there with
[16:30] that heart I manipulate it and then do
[16:32] all those things but you see what he's
[16:33] doing is he's quicker than something
[16:35] that they've heard before where a
[16:37] preacher maybe said the Holy Ghost is
[16:38] for you well God has not forgotten you
[16:40] he sent his spirit into the church to
[16:42] prove to you that he loves you and all
[16:44] those kind of things and they might be
[16:45] sitting in their car on the side of the
[16:46] road somewhere or whatever the devil to
[16:50] get them down and out and think of
[16:51] nobody cares about them and the Spirit
[16:53] will begin to rule over them and begin
[16:54] to draw them and that's the father
[16:57] working on them because you see when the
[16:59] father draws you're going to come no man
[17:02] can come to me except the Father which
[17:04] has sent me drawing if we could really
[17:07] if we could really take that to heart I
[17:08] think it would change our approach with
[17:10] our families
[17:11] you wouldn't be dropping that anvil on
[17:13] your kids heads all the time you'd be
[17:15] you'd be getting down on your knees and
[17:16] calling out to God's here God move on
[17:18] that heart I believe I believe your word
[17:20] I believe that the promise which is to
[17:22] all your children and as many as the
[17:25] Lord our God shall call in Acts chapter
[17:26] 2 I believe that's for my children and
[17:29] you'll see something begin to happen
[17:30] when you put your faith to work and he
[17:33] says it is written in the prophets and
[17:35] they shall be all taught of God and
[17:37] every man therefore that hath heard and
[17:39] hath learned of the Father cometh unto
[17:41] me and again where are you learning from
[17:43] you're learning from that father the
[17:45] father quickening the word speaking to
[17:47] you on the on the inside showing you
[17:49] things showing you that you're lost
[17:51] showing that you need a Savior showing
[17:53] that you need something and something
[17:54] begins to work on the inside he said no
[17:56] not that any man hath seen the father
[17:58] save he which is of God he has seen the
[18:01] father
[18:02] verily verily I say unto you he that
[18:04] believeth on me hath everlasting life oh
[18:08] my this is when they begin their that
[18:10] they begin to realize this man ain't
[18:12] just saying that he's just a good
[18:14] teacher or something he's saying that he
[18:16] is God he's saying that he's identifying
[18:19] himself with the Old Testament prophets
[18:22] that that manner that came down from
[18:23] heaven he's identifying himself with
[18:25] that he's saying something he says I am
[18:30] that Bread of Life
[18:32] your father's did eat manna in the
[18:34] and err this is the bread which cometh
[18:36] down from heaven that a man may eat
[18:38] thereof and not die I am The Living
[18:41] bread which came down from heaven If any
[18:43] man eat of this bread he shall live
[18:44] forever and the bread that I will give
[18:46] is my flesh which I will give for the
[18:49] life of the world the Jews therefore
[18:51] strove among themselves saying how can
[18:53] this man give us his flesh to eat you
[18:57] see how easy it is to just argue over
[19:00] Scripture that's what brother Graham
[19:01] said you don't have to believe it just
[19:03] or understand it just believe it just
[19:06] believe it and and walk on now
[19:08] eventually God will open it up to you so
[19:10] that you do understand it I I don't
[19:13] subscribe to any of this nonsense that
[19:15] we just go around just I don't what do
[19:17] you believe I I don't know I I have no
[19:19] other way I believe we should understand
[19:21] what we were believing because if you
[19:23] believe if you say you believe something
[19:25] that you don't even understand and what
[19:26] wasn't that that sounds like madness
[19:29] that sounds that sounds like insanity to
[19:32] say that you're committed to something
[19:33] that you don't even understand now you
[19:38] know brother Brown said when you but
[19:39] when he preached that message
[19:40] investments why would you make an
[19:42] investment on something that you you
[19:44] don't you wouldn't put your make put
[19:46] your money into the Microsoft stock or
[19:48] something if you hadn't looked into it
[19:50] and figured out whether they were
[19:52] financially sound and all these kind of
[19:53] things well when you come to God you
[19:56] need to search like the Bereans did go
[19:58] through the scripture and find out
[19:59] whether these things be true find out
[20:01] whether the preacher behind the pulpit
[20:02] is preaching preaching the truth or not
[20:04] don't just sit there and I swallow up
[20:07] all the false doctrine and then swallow
[20:08] up everything and it just or just go
[20:10] home and and say well I don't understand
[20:13] it and that's just the way it's gonna be
[20:14] I believe I believe that when that when
[20:17] the father begins to draw you something
[20:19] begins to stir within your soul to make
[20:21] you hungry to find out whether these
[20:24] things are true and I it will get you on
[20:25] your knees it will get you in your Bible
[20:27] it will make you search and find out and
[20:33] he said and then jesus said unto them
[20:37] verily verily I say unto you except ye
[20:38] eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
[20:40] drink his blood you have no life in you
[20:42] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[20:44] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[20:46] him up at the last day
[20:48] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[20:50] is drink indeed he eateth my flesh and
[20:53] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[20:56] in him as the living father hath sent me
[20:58] and I live by the father so he that
[21:00] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[21:03] is that bread which came down from
[21:05] heaven not as your father's did eat man
[21:06] and our dead he that eateth of this
[21:08] bread shall live forever Mele was
[21:12] sitting down watching one of those
[21:14] movies the other night that that was
[21:15] about Jesus it wasn't just some some
[21:17] movie but it was about Jesus and and
[21:19] this scene was playing and it really
[21:21] struck me how much of a lunatic a lot of
[21:24] these people must have thought because
[21:27] that that Jesus was saying these things
[21:29] were so so strange and everything so
[21:31] strange hard to understand a minute
[21:34] that's what many people turned away
[21:35] because they they just could not
[21:36] understand what are you saying that
[21:39] you're a vampire and you see that's why
[21:41] many that many don't continue on and
[21:43] they turn away but there's so much
[21:46] arguing going on there's so much
[21:48] debating until you know a lot of times
[21:50] the young people will say well how do we
[21:52] know what's true a lot of times the new
[21:54] message believers will come in and
[21:56] they'll say well how do we know what's
[21:58] true well you cannot know what's true or
[22:01] false you cannot know what's false until
[22:04] you know the genuine so hang on and let
[22:07] the genuine to be made manifest and then
[22:10] you haven't understood just hang on a
[22:12] while get into the word and the Lord
[22:14] will open it up to you he will reveal it
[22:16] to you as time goes by and program said
[22:20] in the harvest time 1964 he said now how
[22:22] could he be bred and the word and word
[22:24] all it would be puzzling to the carnal
[22:26] mind but we are hoping this morning that
[22:28] there is no carnal minds among us that
[22:30] there is a spiritual mind among us that
[22:32] we could understand what the father is
[22:34] trying to get to us here seeing these
[22:36] words are puzzling but at the same time
[22:38] they are scriptural truth see you see
[22:41] what's bringing us into one Accord is
[22:43] the Spirit of God revealing his word
[22:45] when the disciples were there in that
[22:46] Upper Room they were all the Bible says
[22:48] they were all in one Accord and why were
[22:50] they all went all in one Accord because
[22:52] they were all they had heard the
[22:53] preaching of the word for three and a
[22:55] half years they were all there expecting
[22:57] what Jesus had promised that the Spirit
[22:59] would come and
[23:00] and the word there in that upper room
[23:01] and it brought them into a place of one
[23:04] Accord the Bible says they were all
[23:05] praying and they were praying for that
[23:07] that thing to come they were up there
[23:09] waiting and expectation the what will
[23:12] bring us into one Accord is the Word of
[23:14] God the Word of God being an opened up
[23:16] to us you know I sometimes you hear
[23:18] message believers we say what are
[23:21] ministers I mean we say that we should
[23:23] we should we should all come together
[23:25] and that kind of thing but what will
[23:26] bring us together is the Word of God
[23:28] it's bringing us together into one
[23:31] Accord as tearing is holding us and like
[23:34] that masterpiece that brother Branham
[23:36] preached the masterpieces that all of
[23:39] the world is being chipped away so that
[23:41] we're in the in the right shape in the
[23:43] right form that God wants us to be in
[23:46] and that is what is bringing us into one
[23:48] Accord you see all these arguments and
[23:52] divisions and all those kind of things
[23:53] like brother Ryan was preaching when it
[23:55] when he when he was when he was
[23:56] preaching this sermon and he said how is
[23:59] God gonna judge the world is he gonna
[24:00] judge all these divisions in the Roman
[24:03] Catholic Church all these denominations
[24:04] how is he gonna judge the world by what
[24:06] will he just the world he's gonna judge
[24:08] it by the word by the Word of God not by
[24:11] any to particular dot denomination or an
[24:13] in particular church or any group of
[24:14] people around the message there were
[24:15] those kind of things he's going to judge
[24:17] it by the word because Jesus brother
[24:21] branham brother Ram taught in this
[24:22] message that Jesus is trying to get us
[24:24] as he prayed in John chapter 17 he's
[24:26] trying to get us into oneness brother
[24:29] I'm said not for some man to be over
[24:31] something it will never will work one
[24:32] denomination wants to take over the
[24:34] other and one man over the other one but
[24:36] that you might be one with God like
[24:38] Christ and God was one that's what the
[24:41] prayer is that he was the word and Jesus
[24:43] prayed that me we might be the word
[24:46] reflecting him that's his prayer to be
[24:50] answered that's real real being in real
[24:54] one accord with as you as you eat the
[24:57] word which is what we live by you become
[25:00] United with with the revealed word that
[25:02] God is presenting in this age you you
[25:05] becoming more and more in oneness with
[25:08] God that brings as the church becomes in
[25:10] more and more oneness on an individual
[25:12] level
[25:13] brings us more and more into oneness as
[25:14] a whole bride together and then the
[25:17] harvest can come and brother branham in
[25:23] this message he was really kind of
[25:25] iterating how how you can see all of
[25:27] these types and shadows just by looking
[25:29] at nature how that how that little seed
[25:31] goes into the ground and it comes up and
[25:33] in the spring and how how something is
[25:36] planted in the in the in the spring and
[25:38] harvested in the fall and and all these
[25:40] kind of things and then he began to talk
[25:42] about how that you know we don't believe
[25:44] in reincarnation because when a seed is
[25:47] planted the same the seed that comes up
[25:49] is gonna be the seed that goes down when
[25:52] Jesus went down into the grave what came
[25:54] up was not something different it was
[25:56] the same thing so I don't believe he was
[26:00] just saying that for no reason the
[26:01] reason he said we don't believe in
[26:03] reincarnation is because that seed that
[26:05] was planted in the first church age at
[26:07] the beginning of the first church age is
[26:09] the same see that's going to come up
[26:11] it's not gonna be something different
[26:12] it's not gonna be some kind of
[26:13] transplanted thing but it will be the
[26:15] exact same thing I wonder if we could
[26:18] get that revelation tonight if the
[26:20] brother had said if the bride can begin
[26:21] to realize who she is that she will be
[26:24] an invincible army if you couldn't begin
[26:26] to realize that you are that same juror
[26:29] that same that same seed that was
[26:31] planted in the beginning that same seed
[26:34] has come up now and it's time for the
[26:35] harvest because it's time for the
[26:37] harvest because it's come up now it's
[26:39] being made manifest in his people that's
[26:42] not too hard is it come on with me and
[26:48] he talked about how we can only eat
[26:51] barley live by eating dead substance and
[26:53] this and Christ had to die as we read in
[26:56] and and in the description earlier that
[26:58] he had to die so that we could we could
[27:00] eat his the body word of the son of man
[27:03] but you see there's two kinds of there's
[27:06] two kinds of bread there's two kinds of
[27:08] life there's two kinds of bread and
[27:10] there's our natural body is fed by
[27:13] natural bread but our soul is fed by the
[27:17] Word of God I wonder if we could really
[27:21] catch that revelation it would change
[27:23] where we spend all of our time yeah I
[27:25] believe you
[27:26] you know some some Saturdays when I'm
[27:29] working in the yard I'll just pull up
[27:30] put on the tape and just listen to it
[27:32] the other Saturday I was out there
[27:33] listening to a tape I actually listened
[27:35] to several and I was having me a little
[27:37] revival in the arc you know why because
[27:40] the word of God will transform you you
[27:42] you will catch something it will make
[27:44] you a new person yeah it will make you a
[27:47] different creature a different creature
[27:49] Oh get tired on me that's fast now hang
[27:54] on hang on with it it's only there's
[27:58] only 30 minutes not even 30 minute
[28:03] you know sometimes sometimes it when you
[28:06] see people falling asleep and everything
[28:07] and it makes the minister kind of
[28:08] struggle a little bit because you make
[28:10] it feel it makes you feel like people
[28:11] aren't interested
[28:12] you've been laboring all week or
[28:14] whatever and then you come to church and
[28:15] they kind of fall asleep now now is
[28:17] nappy time or whatever
[28:18] that's the hey oh now I'm not trying to
[28:25] be mean but yo y'all don't be mean to me
[28:28] I got to give it back to you a little
[28:34] bit but you see the Word of God is what
[28:39] God what the the gift that God has given
[28:41] to us to give us eternal life and in the
[28:44] Garden of Eden he gave Adam and Eve the
[28:47] Word of God which was providing them
[28:49] daily their youth was renewed every day
[28:51] by the Word of God and they kept eating
[28:53] on the Word of God and then the devil
[28:56] got in there and and he like poison the
[28:58] plant so to speak but there's a there's
[29:00] a wheat plant growing in the Garden of
[29:02] Eden and the devil comes in there and he
[29:04] and he sews his unbelief he says well
[29:06] you mistrust in the word well it tells
[29:09] Eve I got a better way of doing things I
[29:12] got some some information that you might
[29:14] not be aware of it may be Adam had a
[29:16] shared with you yet or God hadn't shared
[29:17] her however it planned out in it and it
[29:20] just squished the whole thing because
[29:21] you see brother Adam explained that that
[29:23] it's like a chain or it's like it's like
[29:26] a though as the wheat plant grows
[29:28] everything has to grow in continuity and
[29:31] if you get if you inject unbelief in
[29:33] there right in the middle of it it stops
[29:35] the whole plan you
[29:37] see as he as he was illustrating all of
[29:39] these believers down through the ages
[29:40] down through the Old Testament that he
[29:43] talked about their failures and how they
[29:45] failed believe in the Word of God like
[29:47] Samson who just got all wrapped up in
[29:49] women and everything even though God had
[29:51] given him a promise and he just he
[29:53] failed and and but you see this this
[29:57] church this this age is gonna have
[29:59] somebody that will not fail somebody
[30:02] that will believe God so completely so
[30:04] completely yield themselves that they
[30:06] will be the God will be able to produce
[30:09] in them that same seed that was planted
[30:11] in the first church age you see they
[30:19] when you just believe one word and the
[30:21] chain of God's Word you die just like in
[30:23] the Garden of Eden they just believe one
[30:25] word and the chain in the chain of God's
[30:27] Word and brother Brent quoted in Genesis
[30:30] chapter 2 verse 16 to 17 this is but of
[30:32] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[30:34] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[30:35] that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
[30:38] surely die you know when I was a younger
[30:41] Christian it almost makes you fearful a
[30:43] little bit well what does that mean does
[30:45] that mean if I if I if I just like if
[30:48] you're preaching if you don't say it
[30:50] like a robot
[30:50] if you don't just repeat brother branham
[30:52] absolutely like like a robot does that
[30:54] mean that it's off no what we're talking
[30:58] about is the revelation if you catch the
[31:00] revelation the rep the revelation is our
[31:02] absolute the revelation is the main
[31:04] thing that we're talking about the
[31:05] essence of the of what the word is the
[31:08] communication the thing that God is
[31:10] trying to communicate to us now when I
[31:13] get up behind the pulpit or brother wake
[31:15] us up we might use a little bit
[31:16] different words but we're communicating
[31:18] the same thing as we're communicating
[31:19] the maturity of the bride coming in to
[31:21] be we're communicating the same thing
[31:23] but maybe using different words so I
[31:25] just throw that in because I know
[31:28] sometimes that can that can get people
[31:29] scared and everything but get catch the
[31:32] revelation the revealed Word of God and
[31:35] don't be afraid don't be afraid to dig
[31:36] in and ask questions brother Branham
[31:41] said in paragraph 104 he said when this
[31:43] chain is broke with Adam and Eve the
[31:45] first family now remember they didn't
[31:47] break a sentence they didn't break three
[31:49] words one
[31:50] man shall hangover he'll buy every word
[31:52] every word that proceedeth out of the
[31:54] mouth of God
[31:55] that's where man's eternal destination
[31:57] is determined why he'll hang by that
[32:00] chain or he'll hang by creed or if
[32:02] there's creed mixed into the chain there
[32:03] there is where the weak link is and
[32:05] you're going that's where the weak link
[32:07] was with Adam and Eve that weak link
[32:09] surely he said God but surely God said
[32:12] it and if God said it God meant it and
[32:15] he also keeps his word by saying the day
[32:17] you eat thereof that day you die that
[32:21] the day you put into you anything else
[32:23] besides the unadulterated Word of God
[32:26] into your soul that's the day that
[32:29] you're separated from God now I believe
[32:32] this this quote and the scripture that
[32:34] we just read in Genesis chapter 2 I
[32:36] believe that it will answer the question
[32:38] maybe a lot of people have the night why
[32:40] do we need to understand the message why
[32:42] do we need the capstone revelation why
[32:44] do we need the seven seals why do we
[32:46] need all these things open because one
[32:49] word off will produce death in other
[32:52] words one word off is gonna gonna take
[32:54] you to the ground but the reason why we
[32:57] had to have a prophet in this last day
[32:59] was to tie up all the loose ends I mean
[33:03] and he's gonna he's gonna fix all the
[33:05] miscommunication over the years all the
[33:08] he's gonna patch everything up so that
[33:10] you know exactly what you're supposed to
[33:13] be doing here where you came from where
[33:16] you're going the pro destination for
[33:18] knowledge all of these kind of
[33:20] everything is patched up so that yeah
[33:22] there's gonna be a bride in this endtime
[33:24] that it will not be one word off you see
[33:27] the gift of God that God has given us in
[33:30] this day that to bring to bring a
[33:31] prophets message to us to deliver us
[33:34] from death to allow us to leap over a
[33:38] troop lift over a wall all those things
[33:40] because it's taken away it's taken away
[33:43] from us our doubt it's answering all our
[33:44] questions we can come boldly before the
[33:47] throne of God after looking into this
[33:49] message with everything all of our
[33:54] answers there every every question we
[33:56] have is in the message about where we
[33:59] came from about what happened in the
[34:01] guard and all those all those kind of
[34:02] things
[34:03] answers all of our questions why do we
[34:06] need to understand the seven seals
[34:08] because it's taken us to full adoption
[34:12] full a full revelation a complete
[34:14] revelation of the Word of God
[34:17] you see because the Word of God is
[34:20] what's taking us it's not our own
[34:22] righteousness somebody said the other
[34:25] day well how can we how can we ever be a
[34:27] bit perfect enough to get out of here
[34:28] how can we ever be perfect enough to
[34:30] take a body change it's not your
[34:32] perfection that's really the secret it's
[34:35] not your righteousness it's God's
[34:37] righteousness brother I'm said in this
[34:41] very message he said now see it's not
[34:43] our good living that just something goes
[34:48] with it it is in our church loyalty that
[34:52] goes with it you say we put so much
[34:56] emphasis on everything else but the Word
[34:58] of God when the word of God should be
[35:00] the main thing that we're focused on but
[35:02] the main thing is staying with that word
[35:05] don't eat nothing else but that word
[35:08] stay with it he is that word now do you
[35:12] see how if you put all of your focus and
[35:15] your emphasis on the word instead of
[35:17] trying to manufacture a clean life the
[35:19] word will take care of you it will clean
[35:22] you up it will wash you up it will mold
[35:24] you into the image of God it will change
[35:26] you and if you put all of your focus on
[35:29] the word you cannot lose how can you
[35:33] lose if you put your focus on the word
[35:35] and you trip and fall as you're leaving
[35:36] the building spiritually or naturally
[35:39] the word will take care of you if you
[35:43] trip and fall and make a mistake just
[35:44] get back up and keep going
[35:46] because you're you're a believer you're
[35:48] trusting in the Lord you know if you if
[35:50] you mess up all you got to do just ask
[35:52] the Lord to forgive you God I messed up
[35:54] forgive me and just keep right on going
[35:56] if if you put your focus on the word and
[36:00] make that the main thing of your life
[36:03] God will take care of you
[36:08] bromas chapter 4 says for if Abraham
[36:10] were justified by works he hath aware of
[36:13] the glory but not before God for what
[36:14] saith the scripture abraham believed God
[36:16] and it was counted unto him for
[36:18] righteousness
[36:19] now that's a powerful scripture right
[36:22] there abraham believed God and that
[36:25] believing was candid in him for
[36:27] righteousness
[36:28] so you're believing the word is going to
[36:30] be counted to you for righteousness all
[36:33] the way up your journey all the way up
[36:35] now now that doesn't mean we're lit we
[36:37] don't live clean or whatever but
[36:38] believing right will make you clean
[36:40] because believing right will tell you
[36:42] how you're supposed to live and because
[36:44] you're believing right that will make
[36:46] your flesh obey your soul on the inside
[36:48] it will make you it will quicken you
[36:50] that that sings if that same spirit they
[36:52] quickened Jesus quickened his mortal
[36:54] body lives in you it will quicken your
[36:55] mortal body it will quicken you to his
[36:58] word now to him that worketh is the
[37:00] reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
[37:02] but to him that worketh not but
[37:04] believeth on him that justifieth the
[37:06] ungodly his faith is accounted is
[37:09] counted for righteousness you see how
[37:12] that just flips around all this
[37:13] preaching of legalism and everything you
[37:15] got a dress right you do have to dress
[37:16] right and all this kind of things but it
[37:18] starts from the inside and works its way
[37:20] out it's the inward work of grace coming
[37:23] out my goodness some of y'all lift up
[37:32] your weary heads arise now the sleepless
[37:36] this can't be that born ah look brother
[37:45] Branham was as he was preaching this
[37:47] message he talked about how how God down
[37:49] through the ages he tried to find a man
[37:51] that would that would live the word that
[37:54] would serve the law and he looked down
[37:55] through the ages as the prophets spoke
[37:57] his body into existence preach that how
[37:59] he would come and where he would come
[38:00] and he looked at lives like Noah and
[38:03] Abraham and Moses and David and and they
[38:06] all had a message for their day and
[38:08] brother Graham would preach about how
[38:09] how y'all pray for me now yo I got a
[38:17] push back against that sleepy spirit I
[38:20] big that sleepy spirit in the name of
[38:21] Jesus I rebuke it they had they had a
[38:26] message for their their day and they you
[38:28] know how strange it would be for know
[38:31] Abraham to preach Noah's message or
[38:34] Moses to preach Abraham's message and
[38:35] all those kind of things but the reason
[38:37] he said those things is because they're
[38:39] it's moving up to a final culmination
[38:41] Noah and Moses and Abraham they could
[38:44] not they made mistakes in their life
[38:46] they they fell away at the word they
[38:49] lost focus and they all know what got
[38:52] drunk Moses had lost patience everybody
[38:55] Abraham gave his wife away everybody in
[38:57] the Bible that you could live David soul
[38:59] is best friend out and to get his wife
[39:01] and all those kind of things they all
[39:03] messed up they goofed up but it was
[39:05] bringing up to a final culmination where
[39:07] that that seed would be revealed now you
[39:10] see he's compared in that as he brings
[39:12] preaches this message he's comparing the
[39:14] life of Jesus as the the prophets
[39:17] preached preached down through the Old
[39:19] Testament finally John the Baptist
[39:21] revealed the Son of Man at the end of
[39:23] the Old Testament he's comparing that
[39:25] with the same thing has got to happen
[39:26] with the bride as at the end of the Old
[39:29] Testament that the the wheat the wheat
[39:31] seed was revealed at the end of the New
[39:33] Testament that same seed has to be
[39:36] revealed the individuals in each age are
[39:40] reflecting that Morningstar he talked
[39:42] about how that you could see the life of
[39:44] that of that one and Noah and Abraham
[39:47] and Moses and David but finally you
[39:49] could see at the end of the age the
[39:51] Morningstar the one that it was talking
[39:53] about and now down through the seven
[39:55] church ages the light and each of those
[39:57] messengers were reflecting the light of
[40:00] the morning star but at the end of the
[40:01] age finally you see that morning star
[40:04] revealed in his completeness and his
[40:06] fullness walking in flesh again you see
[40:08] brother Branham said in the end
[40:11] paragraph 144 he said finally this
[40:13] perfect one arrived now he arrived to be
[40:16] tempted and every point just like we are
[40:17] the Bible said he was he was tempted
[40:19] like Noah he was tempted like Moses he
[40:21] was tempted like all the rest of them if
[40:23] we had time to break that down and show
[40:26] you but we haven't because I don't want
[40:27] to take too much of your time and he
[40:29] says he goes on in paragraph 145 Satan
[40:31] never changes this tactic neither does
[40:33] God just changes ages but Satan got it
[40:36] got him back there to the first family
[40:38] of God on earth here at his brother
[40:40] sister don't fail to get this how does
[40:42] Satan get the first family he couldn't
[40:44] break it no other way but to get that
[40:46] word broke so they were fortified behind
[40:49] that word if he could only get one gap
[40:54] that's how he has got every Church in
[40:56] every age you got every believer just
[40:58] pull that gap out well I believe the
[41:02] Bible is right but I don't believe that
[41:04] oh there he go too bad but there he win
[41:08] every word that proceedeth out of the
[41:11] mouth of God in other words it matters
[41:15] what you believe and I believe we
[41:17] believe something here I was listening
[41:18] to somebody on on YouTube there was a
[41:21] minister that little conference thing
[41:23] they're all on stage and some of the
[41:25] ministers were talking about they were
[41:27] actually a denominational minister and
[41:28] they were talking about how even in
[41:30] denominator denominational ranks you
[41:31] find some of these big mega churches
[41:33] rising up and they're and they're
[41:34] preaching a gospel that doesn't have
[41:36] nothing to do with the cross and they
[41:37] don't even really know what Christianity
[41:38] is and my point is that it's important
[41:40] to understand what we believe and this
[41:42] man was talking about how that that he
[41:45] was at a dinner with some people and one
[41:46] of these big name preachers that he
[41:48] wouldn't name was sitting there and he
[41:49] said you know I was talking to a Islam
[41:52] person a big high-ranking Islam fella
[41:55] and he said I didn't realize how close
[41:57] Christianity was to Islam now the reason
[42:01] why he made a statement light a very
[42:03] shocking statement was because he didn't
[42:05] know what he believed he didn't realize
[42:07] that Islam doesn't even believe it
[42:09] doesn't even believe the New Testament
[42:10] he doesn't realize that they don't even
[42:12] believe that Jesus died on the cross and
[42:14] all those kind of thing they didn't even
[42:15] realize that all those differences
[42:17] because he didn't even realize what he
[42:19] believed
[42:19] so you see you got to know what you
[42:22] believe before you begin making
[42:23] judgments about other things you can you
[42:25] recognize the false if you don't even
[42:27] know what you believe what the real
[42:28] genuine is you've got to you got to come
[42:31] to a realization to search it out what
[42:34] the truth is before you'll know what the
[42:36] false is and my point is the reason I'm
[42:39] saying that is because at the end of
[42:41] this message brother Brown brings out
[42:42] that every harvest has to has two crops
[42:45] has got the tares
[42:47] real genuine you know even that that
[42:49] famous quote that we all like to quote
[42:51] when when when the bride can begin to
[42:53] recognize the two spirits in the
[42:55] framework of the church that all has
[42:58] something to do with the harvest time
[42:59] because if you can recognize the genuine
[43:02] then of course you're going to be able
[43:03] to recognize the Antichrist you can
[43:06] recognize the truth and of course you
[43:08] can recognize the false and the
[43:11] difference is the word of God the
[43:13] difference is that that that the false
[43:15] the false cannot impersonate the true
[43:18] revealed Word of God they could infer
[43:21] the devil could impersonate everything
[43:23] else but it cannot tread personate a
[43:25] true revelation you say well what
[43:28] brother brought that seems that seems
[43:29] very strange that the true genuine
[43:33] church will be running the aisles and
[43:35] and jumping on the backs of the pews and
[43:36] all these kind of things but I I thought
[43:38] that Jesus had a a calm he never had to
[43:41] yell and scream when he cast out Devils
[43:43] he knew his place he knew where he came
[43:45] from he knew what his purpose was in
[43:47] life he knew that he was he was called
[43:50] to preach a deliverance to the captives
[43:51] to preach to preach to the poor and all
[43:53] those things that would that he ran from
[43:55] Isaiah there is he still at stores stood
[43:57] in the temple he knew what his purpose
[43:59] was and he didn't have to get all
[44:01] excited sometimes sometimes we you see
[44:07] Jesus as you if you go back and study
[44:11] this message the harvest time Jesus was
[44:14] tempted by all these three things these
[44:17] three looking at signs and trying to
[44:19] trying to look at the supernatural
[44:21] trying to make himself a big position
[44:22] and all these kind of things in brother
[44:24] Branham the reason he brought this out
[44:25] was that he said you also in your
[44:28] Christian journey will be tempted the
[44:29] same way that Jesus was to try the devil
[44:34] is trying to draw you away from the main
[44:37] thing the main thing I say I know this
[44:41] this may be sounds like very almost the
[44:43] shallow boring sermon and everything but
[44:46] think about how deep this is if you just
[44:48] lift up your weary eyelids for a moment
[44:50] and think about how how the
[44:53] main thing is the word of God and how
[44:56] easy it seems for people to be drawn
[44:58] away do you realize at the end of this
[45:00] message at the harvest time brother when
[45:02] as brother Branham was preaching it he
[45:04] said it he quoted all those things about
[45:06] how what a small group is gonna be at
[45:08] the end time a small group now not a
[45:10] small group of Christians overall down
[45:13] through the seven churches not a small
[45:15] people and all of the bride but a small
[45:18] group of people that will come all the
[45:20] way to receiving the full word come all
[45:23] the way to adoption to the seals being
[45:26] open because people get so easily
[45:29] distracted by things they don't have
[45:31] nothin to do with the word brother
[45:34] Brahim said at paragraph 107 he said
[45:36] remember the Bible said in the mouths of
[45:37] three witnesses he said we'll get on
[45:39] that in a few minutes on the three
[45:40] temptations of Jesus the three
[45:43] temptations of ministers today where
[45:45] they make the fall three temptations of
[45:47] the church and where they make their
[45:48] fall three temptations of an
[45:50] organization where it makes its fall and
[45:51] the three temptations and the
[45:53] individuals and where they make their
[45:54] fall see the devil the devil always
[45:56] tries to tempt you in these same three
[45:59] ways as I was kind of listening and
[46:07] that's how I was I was pondering up does
[46:09] the devil just like creativity in
[46:18] Matthew chapter 4 verses 1 to 4 it says
[46:20] with that scripture that we read earlier
[46:22] he said but Jesus was led up of the
[46:25] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[46:26] of the devil and when he had fasted 40
[46:28] days and 40 nights he was afterward an
[46:30] hungred and when the depth tempter came
[46:32] to him he said if thou be the Son of God
[46:34] command that these stones be made bread
[46:36] but he answered and said it is written
[46:39] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[46:42] every word that proceedeth out of the
[46:43] mouth of God do you realize what the
[46:46] devil's doing there the devil was given
[46:48] Jesus something natural to look at do
[46:51] you realize what I was saying earlier
[46:53] about there's two different kinds of
[46:54] bread there's natural bread and their
[46:56] spiritual bread and instead of he was
[46:58] diverting Jesus's eyes from the natural
[47:01] trying to get his eyes off of the
[47:02] spiritual bread to the natural bread you
[47:06] know that's the same
[47:07] that same tactic he'll do to you because
[47:10] you'll get people get all caught up in a
[47:12] beautiful church or or a plush pews or
[47:15] not nice bathrooms or or here's the real
[47:18] kicker they want a nice a condole priest
[47:20] a condo preacher just don't over them
[47:23] and not preach anything that will that
[47:24] will help them along their journey not
[47:26] offend them at all you see when you
[47:27] begin to look for a condo priest you're
[47:30] looking at something natural and
[47:31] something instead of something that will
[47:32] feed your soul a condo priest might be
[47:36] kind to your outside or your spirit or
[47:38] whatever but it's not going to be
[47:39] helpful at all to your soul we want a
[47:42] flowery bed of ease so much times we
[47:44] want an easier to drive to church or
[47:46] maybe no drive at all well we can just
[47:48] kind of sit at home and stream in and we
[47:50] don't have to do anything we just might
[47:52] we just kick our feet up and drink a
[47:54] glass of lemonade because but we're
[47:56] looking at something natural and instead
[47:57] of something spiritual the world of God
[48:00] is what will feed your soul well here's
[48:03] the here's the real bad thing we look at
[48:05] other people instead of ourselves we
[48:07] look at everything in the world we'll
[48:08] look at brother Branham and all the
[48:10] supernatural things that happen in his
[48:11] life and we think that's got to happen
[48:13] in our life we look at the way that
[48:14] brother Dale conducts his life and we
[48:16] think of ministers think well I got to
[48:18] act like brother Dale well instead of
[48:20] just being what God calls us to be and
[48:21] we end up looking at one another instead
[48:23] of looking at the word do you realize if
[48:26] you look at the word you'll find your
[48:27] place in the word you'll find what
[48:29] you're supposed to be and you can see
[48:30] your path in your journey where you came
[48:32] from and all these kind of things but if
[48:33] you get caught up looking at other but
[48:35] somebody else you won't have that
[48:37] privilege because you'll be blinded to
[48:39] the things that the word has in it
[48:42] you'll you know here's another thing
[48:44] people get caught up I've seen this I've
[48:46] seen this happen and people get
[48:47] discouraged by the word and they feel
[48:49] like that it's not opening up quickly
[48:51] enough so they start they start
[48:53] deviating over where I'm gonna start
[48:55] studying Roman history I'm gonna study
[48:57] all about his lips - babbles I'm gonna
[49:00] study all about the Roma the history of
[49:02] the Romans and the Greeks and all these
[49:04] kind of things and now they've got
[49:05] devious it seems like it's profitable
[49:07] season like it might like it might be
[49:09] helpful in a sermon or whatever but yeah
[49:11] they're they've lost focus of the
[49:14] mystery that God is trying to reveal and
[49:16] they get off-track and and now they're
[49:18] just like
[49:19] Noah and Abraham and everybody else in
[49:21] the Old Testament all the things that
[49:22] have been spoken of where they just
[49:23] didn't continue on to a perfect
[49:26] understanding to a perfect revelation
[49:28] but if you keep going on and open up
[49:30] your life open up keep your eyes focused
[49:33] on Jesus he will take you to the finish
[49:35] of the road
[49:36] oh my you can you can you can get your
[49:39] you can get your eyes focused on world
[49:41] events now you can get your eyes this is
[49:44] something to really preach on if the
[49:46] Word of God is the only thing that will
[49:48] help you with your soul focus on all
[49:52] these news things and all that kind of
[49:54] stuff is not going to be profitable to
[49:56] you in the way that you think it will be
[49:58] you know I you know people I hope they
[50:02] don't listen to this but people at my
[50:03] work they they're getting all up in a
[50:06] tizzy by looking at I mean people are
[50:07] literally about to lose their minds
[50:09] because of looking at the things going
[50:11] on in the world and just being in a
[50:13] state of fear and calling people stupid
[50:16] because they're going out among getting
[50:18] to get groceries and stuffing and all
[50:19] this guy because people they don't have
[50:21] that same confidence that we can have by
[50:24] looking into the word the only the only
[50:26] place of peace a joy and and comfort in
[50:30] this in this kind of hour is the Word of
[50:32] God and you know here's a really hard
[50:40] one to preach on to is that sometimes
[50:42] sometimes the young people can get
[50:44] distracted by looking at their mom and
[50:46] dad by looking at their parents and they
[50:49] look at all the bad things that their
[50:50] parents used to do and they think they
[50:51] can to make excuses where I can my mom
[50:54] and dad used to used to just break out
[50:59] the lids unroll the scroll and read it
[51:01] out oh yeah oh yeah they did this and
[51:03] they did that and say all these things
[51:05] and they begin to look that's my excuse
[51:07] because my parents did it because I may
[51:09] be a minister when they were younger
[51:11] living wrong or whatever they they did
[51:13] these things and you began to look at
[51:15] that as an excuse at the natural bread
[51:18] instead of the bread for your soul
[51:20] the only thing that will change your
[51:23] soul is the Word of God
[51:25] you remember Josiah in the Bible that I
[51:28] one that I like to quote so much because
[51:30] of and then not because we have a job
[51:32] site here in the church but because of
[51:33] that Josiah and in the Bible
[51:35] his dad was an unbeliever and when he
[51:37] got old enough he began to say I'm going
[51:40] to I'm going to live the right kind of
[51:42] life and he didn't look at his dad he
[51:44] didn't look at all of his ancestry and
[51:46] all the ones that I lived before him
[51:47] that we're not living right but he lived
[51:49] according to the scripture he he he he
[51:53] he let the Word of God be food for his
[51:57] soul instead of the things that he could
[51:58] look at naturally brother Brandon this
[52:02] is the place in in his little and his
[52:04] sermon where he told that story maybe he
[52:06] told it other other places too about the
[52:08] raccoon how how he used to he'd get a he
[52:12] trapped raccoons by by taking a little a
[52:14] little brown thing and putting nails on
[52:17] it inside so that when the raccoon stuck
[52:19] his hand in there he he couldn't get it
[52:21] out and he put something flashy in there
[52:23] too so the raccoon would go after the
[52:26] interesting thing brother I said he put
[52:27] that was flashy was his dad would be
[52:29] smoking cigarettes and he on that little
[52:31] 10 was it look like a little aluminum
[52:33] logo or something he call it a tag and
[52:37] if you look up there's old old-timey
[52:39] tobacco tins or whatever they had a
[52:40] little tag on it they had the logo or
[52:42] the company or whatever and he'd take
[52:44] that thing off because it was real shiny
[52:46] and he put it down on the inside of that
[52:47] thing for the raccoon they're coming and
[52:49] stick his hand in there because this
[52:51] raccoon was attracted to the shiny thing
[52:54] just like how a lot of a lot of
[52:56] Christians today are attracted to the
[52:57] shiny thing and when the raccoon got his
[52:59] hand in there and that that tobacco logo
[53:02] that cigarette logo he wouldn't turn
[53:05] loose you see what a perfect description
[53:08] of one of our problems if you know when
[53:10] the preaching goes across the pulpit of
[53:12] this and it's just tearing up about
[53:14] smoking tobacco so vaping or doing
[53:17] smoking marijuana or looking at
[53:18] pornography or whatever that thing is or
[53:21] just your wrong doctrine I think that's
[53:23] one of the you know we talk about all
[53:25] the problems that the young people have
[53:26] but what about the problems that the old
[53:28] people have and a lot of the problems
[53:30] that the older ones have is turning
[53:31] loose of that old doctrine that you
[53:33] heard years ago that you just ask your
[53:35] pet doctrine you just can't let go with
[53:36] that thing you want to argue and debate
[53:39] it
[53:39] and the preachers just preaching away
[53:41] trying to get you to understand the true
[53:42] revelation of the gospel but if you'll
[53:44] just turn loose of that thing you can
[53:46] see the true how it really is in the
[53:48] Word of God and you'll be able to go
[53:50] forward until you turn lose until that
[53:52] raccoon turn loose he was trapped you
[53:55] might be born again tonight but you
[53:57] might be still trapped by some old
[53:58] doctrine that you can't let go of you
[54:01] got to turn loose brother Branham said I
[54:09] need some glasses he said everything
[54:12] that he promised that God promised in
[54:14] the Bible if you'll turn loose from
[54:15] every Creed every Creed I saw them old
[54:18] things that you've been taught that
[54:20] ain't right that you need to let go of
[54:22] if you'll turn loose from every Creed
[54:24] and everything else and hold on to the
[54:26] word God is obligated to take care of
[54:28] his word
[54:29] and so when they did this the word
[54:31] vindicates itself the word will
[54:33] vindicate itself and then another thing
[54:35] the next thing because brother Brown he
[54:38] goes through this series if you go back
[54:39] and listen to this I encourage you to
[54:41] let don't just take my word for it as
[54:42] levar burton used to say on Reading
[54:44] Rainbow just don't take don't just take
[54:51] my word for it but go back and find out
[54:53] for yourself yeah I'll make you laugh a
[54:56] little bit wake up go back and find out
[55:00] where brother Brown taught and he said
[55:01] as soon as the devil gets through with
[55:03] that test he'll go on to the next test
[55:06] if you pass that test he'll tempt you
[55:08] with something else and that next thing
[55:10] he'll tempt you where this is to give
[55:12] you something supernatural to look at my
[55:15] goodness what a trap that is my let's
[55:20] read it in Matthew chapter 4 verse 5 to
[55:22] 7 he says then the devil taketh him up
[55:24] into the holy city and setteth him on a
[55:26] pinnacle of the temple and saith unto
[55:28] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[55:30] thyself down for it is written he shall
[55:32] give his angels charge concerning thee
[55:35] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[55:37] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[55:40] against the stone not the devil that was
[55:42] quoting scripture he'll close gilchrist
[55:44] grip sure - like he did it even the
[55:46] garden he'll come to you with a false
[55:48] interpretation of the word
[55:51] and tell you like this brother Brian was
[55:53] preaching this sermon he was hitting on
[55:54] all these people saying when telling
[55:56] believers they couldn't get born again
[55:58] and that the days of miracles has passed
[56:00] and all that kind of stuff but the when
[56:02] the word is revealed it will interpret
[56:04] itself if you believe that if somebody
[56:07] tells you that the Holy Ghost is not for
[56:08] you just take God at His Word and find
[56:10] out whether it is not find out if God
[56:12] will give it to you or not but Jesus
[56:16] said unto Him it is written again thou
[56:17] shall not tempt the LORD thy God you see
[56:20] this is the this is like a step above
[56:23] the previous temptation where the devil
[56:26] is like okay if they didn't fall flat if
[56:28] they didn't fall for that one then I'll
[56:29] get there their eyes off of the word
[56:32] with this trick and you know one of the
[56:35] one of the slickest ways the devil could
[56:37] get into a congregation is it is by
[56:41] false gifts by maybe somebody it's doing
[56:44] something spiritual or something or
[56:45] having a dream or whatever or something
[56:48] come up somebody rise up and beget to
[56:49] say something that is patently untrue
[56:51] just completely false many times the
[56:54] devil will maybe come to young people
[56:56] and I preached on this before many times
[56:58] about how many how many young boys would
[57:01] come to my daughter and say well I had a
[57:02] dream or how many how many people will
[57:04] come to young girls out in the message
[57:07] that ministers that I've talked to many
[57:09] times and say all these boys from
[57:11] different countries and stuff would come
[57:12] around and say well I had a dream I had
[57:14] that something supernatural happened
[57:16] let's say you got to take it back to the
[57:17] word the word is our absolute we can
[57:20] outright we rely on footage sensations
[57:22] and excitement and all those kind of
[57:23] things but on the other hand let's Paul
[57:26] told Timothy let's not quench the spirit
[57:28] we get so far on one side until if
[57:31] somebody would have rise up and get
[57:32] catch a revelation and by stimulation
[57:34] they want to scream out and come to the
[57:37] altar or maybe run around the church
[57:38] then we look on them with poorni fingers
[57:40] and say that's not right
[57:42] that's not right but it might be right
[57:44] we just need to focus on the main thing
[57:47] which is the word of God the revealing
[57:49] of his word
[57:50] now now you could just because you run
[57:53] around and scream or something that is
[57:54] not an evidence that it may not be an
[57:56] evidence of anything the only evidence
[57:58] that we can rely upon is that rock they
[58:01] Jesus talked to Peter about the rock of
[58:03] revelations that I found my church on
[58:05] you can go back to that rock and and lay
[58:08] your head on it like Jacob did in the
[58:09] Old Testament and when he saw that
[58:11] ladder a rock of foundation that you
[58:13] cannot be shaken from like a man that
[58:15] builds his house not only seeking sin
[58:17] but on a rock that you will not be
[58:19] shaken from the rock of Revelation
[58:24] that's why brother Branham hit so many
[58:26] times you talked about how we can't put
[58:28] our confidence and feelings or an
[58:30] emotional experience or maybe you and a
[58:32] lot of crying or or or somebody rise up
[58:35] and prophesy contrary to the word and
[58:37] all these kind of things all in the
[58:38] hands and all these different kind of
[58:40] things you know we saw up in North
[58:42] Georgia a while back that everybody got
[58:44] kind of riled up about the old that was
[58:46] coming out of that Bible and of course
[58:48] if you go I'm not gonna say it from
[58:49] behind the pulpit if you could look it
[58:50] up google it what happened next but you
[58:53] see people put their confidence in those
[58:54] kind of things people put their
[58:56] confidence in that instead of trying to
[58:59] find what is real in the Word of God
[59:04] that's why Paul or Peter the 2nd Peter
[59:07] 1:16 he said this is so fantastic
[59:10] y'all get excited with me just for a few
[59:12] minutes hang on there women he said in
[59:15] verse 16 he said for we have not
[59:17] followed cunningly devised fables when
[59:19] we made known unto you the power and
[59:21] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we
[59:23] were eyewitnesses of his majesty
[59:25] for he received from God the Father
[59:27] honor and glory when there came such a
[59:29] voice to him from the excellent glory
[59:30] not now the point I'm trying to make as
[59:32] we read this is he saw some amazing
[59:34] things but that is not what he where he
[59:36] put his confidence and whom I am
[59:39] well-pleased in this voice which came
[59:41] from heaven we heard when we were with
[59:42] him in the holy mountain we heard the
[59:44] voice in other words I went on the
[59:46] fishing trip with brother Branham I was
[59:48] there when he preached Christ to mystery
[59:49] God revealed I was that I did all those
[59:51] kind of thing I saw him speak to the
[59:53] people and turn his back on the audience
[59:55] I saw all those kind of things but in
[59:58] verse 19 Peter says we have also a more
[1:00:00] sure word of prophecy something more
[1:00:04] sure than all the things I saw with my
[1:00:07] natural eyes something more sure than
[1:00:09] anything that I saw while I was on a
[1:00:11] fishing trip or anything like that he
[1:00:13] said we're on to
[1:00:14] you well that you take heed as unto a
[1:00:16] light that shyness in a dark place until
[1:00:18] the day dawn and the day star arise in
[1:00:20] your hearts what could be more sure than
[1:00:23] Jesus seeing Jesus and Peter and John
[1:00:25] and all them on the Mount of
[1:00:27] Transfiguration when a voice spoke from
[1:00:28] heaven and said this is my beloved son
[1:00:30] well hear ye him what could be more sure
[1:00:32] than that more sure than that is a
[1:00:34] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:00:36] you inside of your heart that came by
[1:00:38] you here in the Word of God in your age
[1:00:42] that's why that's why Jesus said in
[1:00:45] Matthew chapter 7 not every one that
[1:00:47] saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into
[1:00:48] the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth
[1:00:50] the will of my father which is in heaven
[1:00:52] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:00:55] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:00:56] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:00:59] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:01:01] why because they were looking at
[1:01:03] supernatural things something to get
[1:01:05] their mind off the true thing that they
[1:01:07] should be focused on which is the Word
[1:01:09] of God the Word of God is the main thing
[1:01:13] a revelation of his word let me read
[1:01:18] this this quote and the paragraph 3:14
[1:01:20] in the harvest time and I reformatted
[1:01:24] this quote I hope it don't offend
[1:01:25] anybody but I put some some paragraph
[1:01:29] indentions and stuff in here so that
[1:01:31] maybe some things will stand out he said
[1:01:34] you say well this I don't care what this
[1:01:35] does and that does this is what the word
[1:01:37] says brother sister I'm trying to get
[1:01:39] that to you see it's what the word says
[1:01:40] we live by the word not what some
[1:01:43] evidence or some carnal something or
[1:01:47] some experience that don't have one
[1:01:51] thing to do with it any kind of an
[1:01:54] experience won't work if it denies the
[1:01:56] word many will succumb to me and say I
[1:01:59] prophesied casted out devils I spoke in
[1:02:01] tongues I done all of these things
[1:02:02] preach the gospel and in doctor of
[1:02:04] divinity said you work of radicular
[1:02:09] after all these things that the devil
[1:02:12] throws at you after he tries to give you
[1:02:15] something natural look here you can take
[1:02:18] that down now I'm done with that one
[1:02:19] after he after he puts things
[1:02:23] supernatural in your face you see you
[1:02:26] see what what's happening here
[1:02:27] you're as you go through all these
[1:02:29] temptations you were maturing in the
[1:02:31] word and you're beginning to recognize
[1:02:34] the tactics of the devil and you're
[1:02:36] beginning to recognize to be able to
[1:02:37] identify the true from the false as you
[1:02:39] come up higher and the next thing the
[1:02:42] devil will do to you is he'll offer you
[1:02:43] up a position of prestige in Matthew
[1:02:47] chapter 4 verse 8 to 10 it says again
[1:02:50] the devil taketh him up into an
[1:02:51] exceeding high mountain and show with
[1:02:53] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:02:54] the glory of them and saith unto him all
[1:02:57] these things will I give thee if that
[1:02:58] will fall down and worship me then saith
[1:03:01] Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for
[1:03:04] it is written thou shalt worship the
[1:03:05] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[1:03:08] serve now brother Branham he preached on
[1:03:15] how a lot of Ministers would kind of
[1:03:17] fall prey to this and they you know that
[1:03:19] be offered a big position and a
[1:03:21] denomination or are all this kind of
[1:03:23] things but you know that could happen
[1:03:25] even in a little simple church not being
[1:03:27] offered a big position or something but
[1:03:28] looking for prestige instead of the Word
[1:03:31] of God we're not coming you know I've
[1:03:32] preached this many times before we're
[1:03:34] not coming to church for prestige or to
[1:03:36] be somebody important we're coming to
[1:03:37] church to build character a lot of times
[1:03:40] to build character you need to be the
[1:03:41] doormat for a little bit and and
[1:03:43] sometimes if you can catch that
[1:03:45] revelation you'll be a willing doormat
[1:03:47] Willy I'd rather be a door for a doorman
[1:03:50] in the house of the Lord and then
[1:03:51] anything else David said I'd rather be
[1:03:53] just whatever God wants to me to be if
[1:03:55] he wants to to put me over to the side a
[1:03:58] little bit or or let people step on me
[1:04:00] or let me be just be a foot watch flunky
[1:04:02] or whatever it is but you know so many
[1:04:04] times we get in our heads that we got to
[1:04:05] be somebody big we got to be somebody
[1:04:07] important so we can tell everybody else
[1:04:08] what to do and and run the show and that
[1:04:11] kind of thing but maybe in this
[1:04:13] particular stage of your life that's not
[1:04:14] what God wants you to be and that will
[1:04:17] that will get in your way so many times
[1:04:19] I think I've shared this before from
[1:04:20] behind the pulpit but one time I was
[1:04:22] talking to a minister and I was just
[1:04:23] sharing to him that I believe that the
[1:04:25] fivefold ministry was was to preach what
[1:04:27] Ephesians 4:12 says to to bring to
[1:04:30] preach to so that the the the bride will
[1:04:33] come into the full unity of the faith
[1:04:35] and he was having he was having some
[1:04:37] real trouble with that and he was
[1:04:39] struggling with that and he said he said
[1:04:41] do you
[1:04:41] mean to tell me that that I've preached
[1:04:44] all around the world I've preached to
[1:04:45] all these different places and and he
[1:04:47] began to appeal to me with his position
[1:04:49] of prestige and and say well you in
[1:04:53] other words you're just a little a
[1:04:54] little foot watch flunky so to speak
[1:04:56] you're just a little doormat you're not
[1:04:58] as important as I am but you see
[1:05:00] position and prestige don't have nothing
[1:05:02] to do with the truth you know Pilate
[1:05:04] asked Jesus what is truth and then you
[1:05:06] turn and walked away and that's what so
[1:05:08] many people do they won't they don't
[1:05:10] want to know stick around and find out
[1:05:11] what truth is and if the if the the
[1:05:15] natural and the supernatural and all
[1:05:17] those things that the devil is put in
[1:05:19] your way before hadn't got in your mind
[1:05:21] your way of looking at the word and
[1:05:23] maybe he can get you with with prestige
[1:05:26] maybe if somebody doesn't treat you
[1:05:27] right in church maybe you'll turn around
[1:05:29] and walk out and say well I have a right
[1:05:31] to be treated a certain way but you
[1:05:33] don't have a right to be treated a
[1:05:34] certain way as a Christian you have
[1:05:36] forfeited your rights what we have a
[1:05:38] right to do is to be submitted in to the
[1:05:40] Potters hands so that he can mold us
[1:05:42] exactly the way he wants us and if we've
[1:05:45] turned out wrong or whatever and he
[1:05:47] needs to start over because we've messed
[1:05:48] up in our and our doctor and all this
[1:05:50] kind of things that he has a right to
[1:05:52] just crack us on the floor and start all
[1:05:54] over again
[1:05:55] he's got a right to do with I said
[1:05:57] whatever way he wants to do we are
[1:05:59] submissive in the Potters hands if he
[1:06:01] wants to just make us something that
[1:06:02] people can walk over or whatever you say
[1:06:05] you know I know brother brother Dale has
[1:06:08] preached this many times if the war you
[1:06:10] have no right to leave a church and I'm
[1:06:12] not preaching this because I think
[1:06:13] anybody's gonna leave or anything so
[1:06:14] don't get nervous you don't have a you
[1:06:18] don't have a right to leave a church if
[1:06:19] the word is being preached you don't
[1:06:21] have a right to leave if the musicians
[1:06:23] aren't playing the way you want them to
[1:06:25] or you don't have a right if you don't
[1:06:27] think there's enough signs and wonders
[1:06:29] going on the only reason you have a
[1:06:31] right to leave or to go anywhere else or
[1:06:33] to look at something else if the word is
[1:06:35] not being brought from behind the pulpit
[1:06:36] because the words the main thing
[1:06:40] but LeBron said in the power of
[1:06:43] transformation paragraph 117 he said if
[1:06:46] you the Methodists don't treat me right
[1:06:47] he's talking to the people who I'll go
[1:06:49] to the Baptist the Baptist don't treat
[1:06:51] me right I'll go to the Pentecostals if
[1:06:52] they don't treat me right I'll go back
[1:06:54] to the Catholics and whatever more see
[1:06:55] they it's a hybrid I have to get them
[1:06:57] sprayed oh I believe God wants us to be
[1:07:02] real Christians well we don't have to
[1:07:04] just baby one another and we can we can
[1:07:07] talk to each other like like real men
[1:07:09] and daughters of God face to face and
[1:07:11] say you hurt my feelings or whatever and
[1:07:13] apologize and and I don't understand
[1:07:15] this what you were preaching in this
[1:07:16] skit nose-to-nose feed the feet and say
[1:07:19] say it like a man or a woman we don't
[1:07:22] have to baby one another because look
[1:07:25] brother brother Brandon the point that
[1:07:27] he was getting I know I've gone a little
[1:07:29] bit longer than I think the thing he's
[1:07:34] getting to is that Matthew 24:24 has to
[1:07:37] be fulfilled which is that in a harvest
[1:07:40] there's going to be two of these crops
[1:07:42] because in Matthew 24:24 says for there
[1:07:45] shall arise false Christ's and false
[1:07:47] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:07:49] wonders insomuch that if it were
[1:07:52] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:07:54] elect
[1:08:04] I'm trying to find a final kind of a
[1:08:07] place to let's keep going I see where we
[1:08:09] I know I always struggle with with ended
[1:08:16] brother I've said there's always twins
[1:08:19] there's been twins all down through the
[1:08:20] ages there was twins in the garden there
[1:08:22] was twins it with Balaam of Moses and
[1:08:25] Judas and Jesus and Cain and Abel and
[1:08:27] but there in the end time there's gonna
[1:08:28] be tears and wheat every revivals
[1:08:30] there's gonna be twins and and this time
[1:08:32] brother branham stressed how close it's
[1:08:36] gonna be that it would deceive that very
[1:08:38] elected if it was possible it would be
[1:08:40] so closed that if you didn't know what
[1:08:42] you were looking for it would deceive
[1:08:44] you that's how close it would be and
[1:08:47] that kind of parallels this parable that
[1:08:49] jesus said in matthew chapter 13 verse
[1:08:51] 24 to 30 I'm gonna skip down to verse 28
[1:08:54] he said unto them an enemy hath done
[1:08:56] this talking about that somebody went in
[1:08:58] here and sowed tares the servants said
[1:09:01] unto Him wilt thou then that we go and
[1:09:03] gather them up but he said nay lest
[1:09:05] while you gather of the tares ye root up
[1:09:08] also the wheat with them so you can't
[1:09:09] you can't tear up the tares you can't go
[1:09:12] around telling people you don't even
[1:09:13] have the new birth you can't go around
[1:09:16] ripping people up I don't even know why
[1:09:18] you're why what you're doing here do you
[1:09:19] think you're here just to pay the light
[1:09:21] bill or something you can't be go around
[1:09:23] tearing people up like that because in
[1:09:25] its time it will be made manifest in
[1:09:27] other words Jesus is telling you don't
[1:09:29] you don't know yet as it's growing up
[1:09:32] but when it comes to maturity you'll be
[1:09:34] able to tell the difference between the
[1:09:36] shuck and the wheat you'll be you'll be
[1:09:39] able to know what to look for
[1:09:41] let broke both grow together until the
[1:09:44] harvest and in the time of harvest I
[1:09:46] will say to the Reapers gather ye
[1:09:48] together first the tares and bind them
[1:09:50] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[1:09:52] wheat into my barn brother Branham said
[1:09:55] in paragraph 135 a power transformation
[1:09:58] he said there's always twins and that's
[1:10:01] the reason don't forget this little
[1:10:02] flock the church and the last days is
[1:10:04] going to be twins
[1:10:05] so close that it'll deceive the elected
[1:10:08] the church is going to it's a
[1:10:10] Pentecostal move it's so much like the
[1:10:12] real thing till it will deceive the very
[1:10:14] elect if it was possible and a little
[1:10:17] later on if I
[1:10:18] get the chance I want to explain what
[1:10:19] how that election comes he is going to
[1:10:21] deceive them because it's almost like
[1:10:24] the same thing see just two fathers
[1:10:27] that's all same other same church same
[1:10:30] movement same thing
[1:10:34] the Betty ground is the same where the
[1:10:37] word falls but one of them like here is
[1:10:40] perverted see one of them is a
[1:10:43] perversion because it's the wrong father
[1:10:46] and he goes on there's so many so many
[1:10:48] different kind of things that we could
[1:10:50] talk about what I'm knowing the ones
[1:10:51] that I would encourage you if you
[1:10:52] haven't listened to an only ones at the
[1:10:54] end time to listen to that I might help
[1:10:55] you to be able to deduce what he's
[1:10:58] talking about here the difference
[1:11:00] between the true and the false but but
[1:11:03] you see brother Brando and I really am
[1:11:06] trying to find a way to close here
[1:11:07] brother branham was talking about how
[1:11:09] there's a second atom and as the second
[1:11:11] bride and they that were bringing up
[1:11:14] down through the ages to a culmination
[1:11:16] point and he said Jesus had to be
[1:11:18] brought up through a long string of
[1:11:19] prophets and so forth and come out
[1:11:21] perfect and then he had to die in order
[1:11:23] to be bred for the rest of him and and
[1:11:25] then he said in another place well now
[1:11:27] what about Eve she has to do the same
[1:11:30] thing the bride was created a new lucky
[1:11:34] was at Pentecost spirit-filled and word
[1:11:37] fed then Eve met her failure so did the
[1:11:39] church down the word was Aten down down
[1:11:42] through the church ages and then it
[1:11:44] began to come back up and now at the end
[1:11:48] of the things no brother Brahim said in
[1:11:52] paragraph 340 he said now watch a corn
[1:11:54] of wheat falls into the ground now Jesus
[1:11:57] was that corn of wheat that fell into
[1:11:59] the ground which was made perfect it had
[1:12:01] life in it Moses didn't raise Adam
[1:12:04] didn't raise none of the rest of them
[1:12:06] race but this perfect one that reflected
[1:12:09] the word and every way every word he
[1:12:12] lived by how many can say Amen by that
[1:12:14] and so at the end of the Old Testament
[1:12:17] the musicians come up well I really am I
[1:12:19] promise I'm closing at the end of the
[1:12:22] age the perfect one came and at the end
[1:12:25] of this age the perfect one is coming
[1:12:28] again you see he said the perfect one
[1:12:29] that reflected the word and
[1:12:31] every way every word he lives by and
[1:12:34] then down at the bottom paragraph 341 he
[1:12:36] said now here comes the church again see
[1:12:38] coming to that perfect one for the
[1:12:41] rapture again
[1:12:42] in other words coming right back to the
[1:12:46] original grain that was planted at the
[1:12:48] beginning right back to the original
[1:12:51] thing if we could if we could catch a
[1:12:54] revelation of what that means that that
[1:12:57] revelation not only comes by the opening
[1:12:59] of the word the word is the main thing
[1:13:01] and as you eat the word and just pile
[1:13:02] that word on it's bringing us to a place
[1:13:06] where we can see what we really are amen

[1:13:12] worship the Lord
