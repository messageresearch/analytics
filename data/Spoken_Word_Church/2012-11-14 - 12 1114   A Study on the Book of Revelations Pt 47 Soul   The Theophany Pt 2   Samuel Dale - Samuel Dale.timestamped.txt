[8:36] they help and they crowd with a loud
[8:38] voice saying how long O Lord holy and
[8:40] true the style not judge and avenge our
[8:43] blood on them that dwell upon the earth

[10:04] you're not going to stop anyway you keep
[10:06] doing it even though you're throwing up
[10:08] to that's what you call disobey the
[10:11] children but yeah yeah now we've been
[10:15] trying for quite a while to cover some
[10:18] things through the Book of Revelations
[10:19] to some that hasn't been here and we're
[10:23] having sister to Kenyan suddenly iron
[10:25] fellowshipping with a summary you know
[10:27] we don't leave anybody behind but we've
[10:30] been doing for quite a while a study on
[10:33] the Book of Revelations and running
[10:36] through the things that the prophet has
[10:38] brought unto us and we went through
[10:41] those things and coming up through the
[10:43] you know a little bit mature changes
[10:45] with mainly coming on up into the fifth
[10:49] chapter of Revelations and finding that
[10:51] that gives the bride of Jesus Christ
[10:54] that he's in glory y'all right after the
[10:57] rat survive alright then we drop over
[10:59] and the prophet of God covers
[11:02] from revelation 6 12 revelation you know
[11:07] to Revelation 661 there's to quote over
[11:11] to revelations 19 then he goes to 19 21
[11:14] yes to Israel we go up in a rapture in
[11:19] Revelations for one knew the bride goes
[11:23] up in revelations for one called John is
[11:25] take it up the top of the rapture all
[11:28] right in doing that then we're studying
[11:30] about what will be after we get out of
[11:33] here and you say why do we need that
[11:36] well we need the plan of redemption amen
[11:40] all right then if we can see the plan of
[11:43] redic where israel then we can see the
[11:47] plan of addiction for ourselves and
[11:49] that's what I've encouraged you to do is
[11:51] to read to see a book we read to seal
[11:54] book not to just find where is the
[11:57] symbolic you know what was right a red
[12:00] mill bail and oh not to diss find the
[12:04] symbolic sin the answer but to find
[12:07] yourself and what God is dealing with
[12:12] you right in your own life from reading
[12:16] that seal and they will see the sure the
[12:19] literal things that happen will happen
[12:21] to israel after the ratchet all right
[12:23] but the spiritual condition are the
[12:26] leading up to that knee is happening
[12:31] right now like this fifth seal gym with
[12:34] reading the minute that the prophet said
[12:36] it was those kill from now Maria only we
[12:41] have to wear the church in that do we
[12:42] leave out of here all right now in doing
[12:46] that then we can see that their
[12:47] Redemption then we're pushing and we can
[12:53] see our Redemption we're rebel who
[12:57] wouldn't want to know about the plenary
[12:59] that was what Paul was so concerned
[13:02] about he said I would that I could be a
[13:04] castaway for my people we know God
[13:08] didn't make him a castaway with God
[13:10] opened his eyes or you can see his
[13:13] people and you can see as we covered in
[13:16] Romans earth you know this blindness has
[13:21] happened to Israel until the Gentile
[13:28] days be finished then he's don't turn
[13:30] back to Israel alright and their eyes
[13:33] will be open and it'll be a wonderful
[13:36] thing well why wouldn't you want to see
[13:38] who they are and what it is and but my
[13:41] point is to pick up then the things from
[13:44] the seals that we can see about
[13:47] ourselves but we went back to foresee
[13:51] list is arm again we're having a
[13:55] spiritual Armageddon right now in the
[13:57] battle of our minds according to you
[14:00] know the Prophet the greatest battle
[14:03] ever followed he's going on right now
[14:05] right here well then we can see
[14:07] ourselves you know we can see they
[14:09] overcame then we can see we can overcome
[14:12] right right then we saw the four-seater
[14:15] what death what is death it's not just
[14:19] dying it's not cutting somebody's head
[14:22] off and burying the body because that
[14:25] doesn't kill you that only puts you in a
[14:28] position some or a condition existence
[14:31] somewhere else nothing that way we can
[14:35] see and pick up from these things and
[14:38] see who we are you see I redemption and
[14:42] to be able to follow you know in that
[14:46] line alright well
[14:49] let's just make sure we don't drop off
[14:52] on anything I know I repeat a lot of
[14:55] funny but what do they say you can only
[14:59] retain about five percent or something
[15:02] of what you hear no you knew that only
[15:06] as the seat can endure who you know over
[15:11] and over doesn't bother right it should
[15:14] open our eyes to be able to see and then
[15:17] we're constantly on the internet may not
[15:19] be live tonight could we don't know
[15:21] they're still having trouble up in New
[15:23] York but it knocked us out do that you
[15:25] know I've been in New York in that
[15:27] condition and it's maybe still doing it
[15:29] now but we hope it's not because we we
[15:33] want everybody to hear and we want them
[15:35] to see all right but now think about it
[15:41] we're at about a group of people that
[15:45] the prophets will read in the minute
[15:47] said now this is a great controversy see
[15:50] they've argued over who is the editor
[15:51] what this is under lip seal but nobody
[15:55] could put it in the correct order no
[15:58] wonder it's so sealed of a mystery until
[16:01] you know it is really sealed up right I
[16:06] mean the Gentiles been grafted in he's a
[16:10] mystery run but that is spoken off but
[16:15] who knew that I was speaking of a fifth
[16:18] seal jus we said blindness in part it
[16:23] happened that Israel come when he didn't
[16:26] even understand the seals and thing but
[16:28] it was not his day in time alright so
[16:32] then it behooves us to dig into that but
[16:36] then see ourselves right like I tried to
[16:41] emphasize the other day let
[16:45] you see the Old Testament people and
[16:48] they've got place which we call paradise
[16:51] and they had the blood of bulls and
[16:53] goats they were speaking of Jesus Christ
[16:56] no you don't want to happen with Jesus
[17:00] raised that lady's right a lot of them
[17:02] not everybody they raised they went to a
[17:06] place which was paradise and taken up
[17:08] gnarly all right so they may have
[17:12] Redemption and you have like the fifth
[17:17] of the foolish virgins the they have a
[17:22] plan of redemption and they'll have to
[17:26] be given eternal life into our own but
[17:28] that's still a plan of redemption i do
[17:31] the blood of jesus christ because
[17:33] everything will be over New Testaments
[17:35] do the bloody Jesus cram all right now
[17:37] lead it in 144,000 they have their place
[17:41] and we found they even go into the
[17:44] millennial reign they have a place right
[17:47] now either believe would be raised up
[17:50] the Prophet said to give somebody for us
[17:53] to sleep too in the millennium and
[17:58] everything the gospel to Gillette means
[18:02] a how the place right but even when you
[18:04] get into the fifth seal jus you said
[18:05] well who is that who is this is reading
[18:10] off don't even run around them until the
[18:13] seal broke I'm ready to go for a minute
[18:15] he said I thought that was the early
[18:19] Christians that were martyred we when
[18:23] the seal broke he said I thought was
[18:25] right now so we can see uh people but
[18:31] what is their redemptive plan
[18:35] if there are people they've gotta have a
[18:38] Redemption around annihilation I fine
[18:41] right ma'am good you know how are
[18:44] addicting leave those foolish virgins
[18:46] have a redemptive plan and even to the
[18:49] White row but the biggest portion of the
[18:52] people in the world that will go to the
[18:54] bathroom without go to hell right right
[18:56] go to be an ally decoding the memory
[18:58] they don't have the reject you for
[19:00] meeeeee for them it's not applied to
[19:03] them all right throw the old testament
[19:06] people not ever is right or Jew is weak
[19:10] all over Israel raise the jesus readies
[19:13] no only the predestinated only those who
[19:18] have their name in the Lamb's Book of
[19:21] Life and it remained lead an elk Nell
[19:26] the how are we getting well that's what
[19:28] I'm trying to get you to see about the
[19:30] field you we know some people do we know
[19:35] these are not it says are sold so it's
[19:38] not a group of people standing there
[19:40] like mortal people they were one time
[19:46] mortal on the earth and they died I
[19:50] killed all right for their belief all
[19:54] right we get him doing that God knew
[19:58] what he was going dead so he blinded
[20:01] Israel where we could recite
[20:08] Leland doing that you think he's gonna
[20:11] throw him away no he's gonna make away
[20:14] hey do we just read in the Bible are
[20:17] that before these on earth her healed
[20:20] 144,000 and lame they're giving my rose
[20:28] but a wonderful thing we have told you
[20:32] of the plan of redemption or to think
[20:34] about the mercy and grace of Almighty
[20:38] God right that he would give her people
[20:42] my robes he turned of life that never
[20:49] wanted it they called for his blood be
[20:53] on them they crucified him yet he never
[21:00] turned his back on then you find Isaiah
[21:03] them crying out for his room you know
[21:11] the real is real man you remember have
[21:13] we brought it up run run said Israel not
[21:15] all Jews he said but Israel he said
[21:19] that's the name of redemption you see
[21:23] those Old Testament prophets cry out for
[21:26] them people that's what Paul was doing
[21:29] in God opened his eyes to allow him to
[21:34] see that his people would be saved I'm
[21:40] sure that was a thrill in the man's
[21:42] heart well why would that be a thrilling
[21:45] our heart
[21:49] maybe we have a reduction that we don't
[21:51] want anyone out of salma part of there's
[21:55] a pretty good sure thing we don't have
[21:57] it right that's no problem with me is
[22:00] any problem with you but what about
[22:05] people that all the others of the
[22:08] connection and even the Old Testament
[22:10] Saints they have some former connection
[22:13] what about a fish seals you that you
[22:16] don't want it you said well I brother
[22:20] Dale I throw the ride free moral agency
[22:26] okay not a problem do you if God wants
[22:32] to do it that way right if calls it can
[22:36] the thing formed say why did you for me
[22:40] this way you want to argue with God
[22:43] about his plan are you so super
[22:47] religious that you can figure it all out
[22:49] and tell god what to do i go to few
[22:54] scriptures brief talking about who is
[22:56] back there with me know what you see to
[23:02] see of people the mercies of Almighty
[23:06] God they would give those sleeping
[23:11] eternal life
[23:15] my clothes ready dingo time with him
[23:17] want to go maybe the next message or two
[23:19] I want to take them I want to take just
[23:21] a plan of redemption all the way through
[23:25] and tied together to where we can see
[23:28] true retention but we are the bride of
[23:33] Jesus Christ our redemptive plan is
[23:38] completed your on earth right amen even
[23:46] 144,000 they're gonna have to die even
[23:50] though the two minutes they'll have to
[23:53] die to be able to go to their redemptive
[23:56] plan are you be resurrected up and
[23:58] rapture yeah the two witnesses you see
[24:03] we don't have to do that we can stand
[24:06] here and enjoy our salvation and think
[24:11] about the mercies of Almighty God right
[24:14] it is extended to you and I right I man
[24:18] I mean what goody-goody did you do for
[24:21] God to say you right my brother I never
[24:26] did dry i didn TI that smoke little
[24:29] someone that was commendable but did
[24:35] that save you
[24:38] did they give the Jesus Christ down
[24:40] inviting that's right we've been
[24:44] realized salvation you take call most
[24:50] and they're saying Hebrew of the Hebrews
[24:51] a Pharisee of the Pharisees concerning
[24:54] the wall blameless he had a good
[25:00] testimony but did that save me what did
[25:07] he say later the thing that I thought
[25:10] was life I found to be dead can you
[25:18] knock on to that place see it's not what
[25:21] we're good we do it's what he done see
[25:26] then you said well you don't believe in
[25:27] living good no people cut that off you
[25:32] got home I'll meet you I believe in
[25:35] being born again and then letting him
[25:38] live right then Paul would say the life
[25:42] that I live in the flesh I live by the
[25:45] faith of the Son of God they're at yeah
[25:52] but that's why people preacher preach
[25:54] do's and don'ts to try to save people
[25:59] Jimmy words ever saved anybody
[26:06] I thought that our life Leo was to be an
[26:09] actor an outward manifestation of an
[26:12] inward work that's within us see it in
[26:17] that way you know what I drank all the
[26:18] trouble too I live steal a level two mom
[26:24] don't want them all right no problems in
[26:27] Oh sound we have troubles yes do you see
[26:32] it every day is what your prophet said
[26:39] go now wait a minute have we seen well
[26:42] argue with your profit you claim to
[26:45] believe we do wrong every day right but
[26:52] that's what I've been trying to do with
[26:53] this lip seals you part to find that
[26:58] water so really is because it says souls
[27:04] they were saying bloomer time so they
[27:09] were so they're not just bodies as i
[27:12] said but they were real see the soul of
[27:18] you as you real you the soul will live
[27:23] on after death somewhere could he get
[27:28] your soul God is the only one to keep
[27:30] your soul the devil can't kill soul hey
[27:35] you only can kill the body you can't do
[27:38] that let's not let's invite all right so
[27:42] then what are we doing trying to find
[27:44] ourselves in these things that has been
[27:49] spoken of to be able to put together our
[27:54] own salvation
[27:57] and to see what exactly taking place and
[28:01] see it either i put in golf drop rose
[28:04] who i put in coffee okay I'm healed of
[28:10] that but it was worried about it and
[28:12] they go sit on it no I'm gonna put in a
[28:16] cough drop then preach them fit offends
[28:21] you I'm sorry i'll bet you preach you
[28:25] get the cough drop huh but i didn't look
[28:29] was it somebody might want to go talking
[28:31] about and I didn't put a button in
[28:35] really clog done pretty good there Sundy
[28:37] buddy he had a hive of a button yeah no
[28:41] no I really enjoyed it had a good time
[28:43] with him running Jordan the message and
[28:46] everything he rested and then when he
[28:48] said in there about two or three times
[28:50] he's gonna get a new body I know brother
[28:51] clock he ain't talking about getting
[28:54] another one I allow no problems lil mike
[28:57] expect that statement he hears instance
[29:00] if i was and i'll come back to you it
[29:02] was doing I don't believe it hard now
[29:06] believing this Marty my new way of
[29:10] living in your body this body made me
[29:12] right not another one this one might new
[29:15] ok now but now look for everybody's
[29:21] benefit out there and the things we put
[29:23] on the water things I said to make sure
[29:26] they understand the directions were
[29:28] going and you know I found out a lot of
[29:31] things over the years and a lot of
[29:33] people they know all about everything
[29:35] but
[29:35] read the book ya know right we dealing
[29:40] that Daniel sandy wait part we found out
[29:42] you know a lot of people's never read
[29:45] the book but they know all about the 70
[29:48] weeks a name they could estar you to
[29:52] pieces hmm but they know nothing about
[29:55] the book especially the drawings and we
[29:59] do Kim like an extra drawing that was
[30:02] signed as to be in that brother branham
[30:04] done it for a man in the cafe all right
[30:07] which is a church now listen I believe
[30:11] in the drawings and the things but if
[30:14] that's not revealed you know much stock
[30:15] my drawings you can the same well this
[30:22] is a difficult Coco Coco but if it's not
[30:24] revealed that's right now one revelation
[30:28] about what the prophet said it's not a
[30:30] he acknowledged because I believe a
[30:35] revelation is what it's necessary all
[30:38] right now who are these in Revelations
[30:43] five then that will be given white robes
[30:47] we can call the fifth of view we can
[30:51] call them those sightings that the
[30:53] Prophet answers it in the message of the
[30:55] fifth seal paragraph 2 18 to go ahead
[30:57] brother and start pulling up the quotes
[31:00] I know I've been on with this one over
[31:02] and over and over but I think it needs
[31:04] to be said again the graph 218 now these
[31:08] cannot be them souls you know what is a
[31:12] great controversy you look back to the
[31:14] topic said you notice this field still
[31:16] being open see the church is gone it
[31:19] can't be the sole under the the early
[31:22] church
[31:22] so you can't beat that so he's taking
[31:25] that out of the way if you would do that
[31:28] sometimes I love to do that I love the
[31:31] light things down it says this is it so
[31:34] whatever comes up later can't change
[31:36] that right if it does this is not it
[31:40] lean now if the Prophet is wrong about
[31:44] the church called up the revelations for
[31:46] one you know and not saying the 19-21
[31:48] know like that then you we're falling to
[31:52] false prophet but if he's right think we
[31:55] don't have to worry about it honey so
[31:58] then we can see when he say who never to
[32:00] say now these cannot be themselves
[32:03] because the soldier of the righteous
[32:06] martyr and the righteous people the
[32:07] church the bride has done been to a cup
[32:09] so they wouldn't be under the altar
[32:13] they'd be in glory with the ride and
[32:15] watch that they are galli the rapture in
[32:17] the fourth chapter of Revelation they
[32:20] was taken up now who are these souls in
[32:23] the that's the next thing who are they
[32:27] then if they are not the early church
[32:29] this is Israel has to be saved as a
[32:33] nation all of them that are
[32:36] predestinated that's Israel that's in
[32:38] fluid sample mine you said we you know
[32:41] that can't be hmm see because they
[32:44] didn't believe it you're quoting what
[32:46] that same leap but then he spends a
[32:51] lengthy time proving
[32:55] about who this is no but it cannot be
[33:01] the bride she's done gone yep huh boy
[33:05] drop down the stack she's done come well
[33:08] I've got a quote over here this will
[33:11] have to fit that one now I don't believe
[33:18] you got a call that a quote I don't
[33:19] believe in the church crisis that look
[33:22] you know I thought my scripts relation i
[33:25] got scripture shoot down your scripture
[33:26] well now I didn't know is in a shooting
[33:29] match man if we got a shooting match you
[33:33] better not get against that man of your
[33:35] sunday that man is the state champion
[33:42] skeet shooter of Oklahoma the champion
[33:48] skeet shooter so he's pretty good I
[33:53] wouldn't want to shoot it out with him
[33:56] now I don't believe in shootin out with
[33:58] anybody I'm leaving the Word of God and
[34:02] I believe even fit all the way through
[34:03] all right so who is that that's Israel
[34:06] to be saved as a nation as I said I keep
[34:10] emphasizing that there was nobody wrote
[34:12] anything about this all right good.you
[34:17] commentators are the things little
[34:19] thoughts alone but even Scofield with
[34:23] Israel as a nation you right over to the
[34:25] 144,000 go he runs it into that group to
[34:28] be saved over a certain way honey let's
[34:32] see think about it the same to start
[34:36] with her I can't get away from that to
[34:38] think about it that God would would save
[34:41] a people and want to be safe
[34:45] but remember everybody won't be safe
[34:48] I'll Israel when we say its nose for the
[34:51] word of God and the testimony they held
[34:56] we're eating minute with the Prophet
[34:57] seems they were real true jews as we
[35:01] calling not Wall Street not all this
[35:03] money junk guys people had never heard a
[35:08] lot of them even about Jesus Christ we
[35:13] get there the chosen of God brother let
[35:16] that man that seems to do away with the
[35:18] blood of Jesus no because the blood of
[35:21] Jesus is want to pay the price for these
[35:24] right when they cried out lady his blood
[35:29] be on on us if he hadn't blinded those
[35:35] people they would have accepted him and
[35:40] you and I wouldn't have any part to do
[35:44] man we see truth comes out and then we
[35:48] under it unfolds and then we can see it
[35:55] hmm we're number two then
[36:01] this is ground down from the other but
[36:05] he says he's got scriptures and he goes
[36:06] to Romans and everything now I emphasize
[36:09] is right here because it brother if
[36:11] Paul's don't speak about Romans and
[36:14] somebody comes up contrary to it you
[36:18] deal with that scripture you call a
[36:20] concert at all about what he's saying
[36:22] the Israel is blinded look where you
[36:25] don't come up to your gonna face
[36:27] relations but is it 18 Republic city is
[36:32] an angel preaching the other thing
[36:33] letting me a cursed that's just all I
[36:36] got to say to anybody watch you go
[36:39] through the scripture brings it out and
[36:41] then what does it say the enterprise we
[36:43] brought in for the bride the blind has
[36:47] come to Israel for that purpose to all
[36:50] this rule will be saved me right now
[36:58] they are Israel that's under the altar
[37:00] watch everyone blind it for the very
[37:02] purpose of us being say you believe that
[37:05] now who glided them God God blinded his
[37:09] own children then the no wonder jesus
[37:14] standing back to cross and them Jews
[37:17] highly for his blood that was his own
[37:21] kids and he was the scripture i love
[37:25] that he was except the word in other
[37:27] words he knew what was going on right do
[37:32] you all taking place on knowing that
[37:36] those people would have gladly received
[37:39] and that's the reason he blinded them so
[37:42] they wouldn't recognize him he got it
[37:45] such a humble way and blinded him to it
[37:47] but they wouldn't receive it the
[37:49] scripture said they would do it and he
[37:51] glided was blinded Jesus pitied them
[37:55] even so much as he said Father forgive
[37:57] them they don't know what they're doing
[37:59] they were blind Paul said they were
[38:02] blinded for the cause for us honey left
[38:07] for you and I they were blinded we
[38:12] wouldn't have a hope me but we're the
[38:17] Bride of Christ he he knew what would
[38:23] take place I love that's what I said ray
[38:26] said he was the scripture he was the
[38:29] Word of God he knew exactly what he was
[38:32] doing what you think he knew then even
[38:36] gonna turn to the Gentiles what about
[38:41] the little woman that girl doubt that
[38:42] son or called out not sunday to have
[38:44] mercy on me you wouldn't listen to her
[38:47] because she was a Gentile but when she
[38:50] said my lord you reminded him of the
[38:54] bride he was coming after right
[39:00] she know what she left him for listen
[39:04] knowing that who are these use then
[39:09] number three click him look to perk up
[39:16] to 40 are you now remember what it was
[39:19] they were killed for the word of god
[39:21] sake not for the testimony of christ
[39:25] this sealed you and kill the testimony
[39:27] of christ did you notice that but
[39:30] remember the church come in also the
[39:32] martyrs of the church was for the word
[39:34] of God and the testimony of Jesus right
[39:36] now that's what we are we have the
[39:38] testimony of Jesus crap their testimony
[39:41] is only that they stayed with the word
[39:43] and they try their best and he knows
[39:46] that here too all right now but these
[39:50] didn't have the testimony of Jesus
[39:51] Christ for the word of God and for the
[39:54] testimony which they held as use and
[39:59] hira hated him so did Eichmann Saudi
[40:04] Stalin over the rest of the world that
[40:07] they stay true to what they believed
[40:11] listen in that wonderful and they kill
[40:15] them because they were Jews mama to hate
[40:20] those people too much
[40:25] there were God's chosen people going to
[40:31] the neck I got to 86 th seal and those
[40:37] old has been martyred now down through
[40:39] here real tools you use down through
[40:41] there they their name on the book that
[40:46] Leo the light right life now how does he
[40:49] named one a book how was your name going

[41:04] of books he said your name goat on them
[41:09] look as a believer he said their names
[41:13] went in the book because they were part
[41:16] of a religious order right so that's how
[41:21] the 50 would use name they'll enter
[41:22] right yeah they live the right live
[41:26] another I think Judaism to the doc
[41:28] lesser playing all the Jews right this
[41:31] late cert me and all the gym time and
[41:33] they were murdered by idling in the
[41:35] other honestly millions of them them
[41:37] during the German shot didn't kill
[41:39] murder them the cream later they do that
[41:41] they work I just because they were Jews
[41:45] they hated in Jews but I think the story
[41:50] was told that Hitler was hot you know
[41:54] what
[41:56] maybe he didn't like him do well cover
[41:58] you hate him what he was like the height
[42:00] couldn't get straightened up but you
[42:02] know going I don't know sort of mine go
[42:04] to the next I got more 54 and now watch
[42:13] under the altar of the breaking of these
[42:15] this Neil and events laying in the time
[42:17] between the death of Christ and the
[42:19] going of the church the Eichmann group
[42:22] and all that them true use with their
[42:25] names on the book now one of these days
[42:29] I'll get back to preach on to that part
[42:31] but I can see better than that one run
[42:32] around with the wind in the reunion and
[42:35] talk about our names being transferred
[42:39] no no grow it in my name let's look at
[42:42] off you probably talked about a transfer
[42:51] you talked about your name coming on the
[42:53] book is a believer in sanctification
[43:00] maybe we did you transfer when we
[43:02] received the baptism and over that goes
[43:04] okay maybe it was transferred that would
[43:09] keep all records straight that feel
[43:13] sealed you name one day will be
[43:16] transferred right right you be
[43:21] transferred from the book of life right
[43:23] as a religious order of people doing you
[43:27] birth for them now that's not the new
[43:30] birth of our times so don't confuse all
[43:32] of it it's just eternal life they get
[43:37] eternal life Lee what look what he said
[43:40] he'd always done I like to do these
[43:43] things look at number six always a lot
[43:47] of them sold on the I wanted to be that
[43:49] early Christian martyrs and some 26 sea
[43:51] lamprey not true I who we found out
[43:54] life's not when the Lord God broke that
[43:57] seal for us it absolutely is impossibly
[44:00] one they were going on to go over from
[44:02] the other side it was a juice it come on
[44:05] down through the town right right yeah
[44:09] you remember we got onto this mass
[44:13] wednesday I told you that we need to
[44:18] find ourselves in the plan every ditch
[44:27] alright what part of you is the most
[44:30] real attacks body spirit and soul would
[44:34] like a human being right the water that
[44:38] is the most important this year so Jesus
[44:46] gave his soul as a ransom for you and I
[44:51] his body went to the gray he's period
[44:54] went back to God and getting bit tilted
[44:59] that Pentecost in the prophet said he
[45:01] sent back his soul in the form of the
[45:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost to fill all of
[45:07] the people we covered it over and over
[45:10] how they run around said it was the soul
[45:13] of Jesus that theophany of his being
[45:17] that went to hell it preached to those
[45:19] trolls in prison he then the real you
[45:25] that feel sealed is showing more to me
[45:29] than anywhere in the scripture the water
[45:34] so really
[45:39] though these were people that had been
[45:43] killed they were driving in a place but
[45:51] to show how that it shows a real soul
[45:54] they were still even crying out for
[45:56] revenge so what it citizen what would
[45:59] you step to lead to the vengeance of our
[46:02] blood season the soul is real you is
[46:10] what you are now I know people say
[46:13] vanilla women brother they'll body
[46:14] spirit soul makes the real you it's like
[46:17] I say it that's fine but then they
[46:22] define to me were that prophet the
[46:25] prophet would say that a Christian seems
[46:28] daily where do you see that if you're a
[46:32] born again Christian it cannot be if
[46:37] your soul is eternal right no way your
[46:42] soul can see in what John said it seems
[46:46] everybody's dead and we cannot sin with
[46:53] the Prophet City send every day the
[46:57] Bible says for the sins this is what we
[47:03] have so where do you see now if you're
[47:06] just saying I'm a unit the body spirit
[47:09] and soul where do you seeing that if
[47:15] it's in the soul you're off right
[47:18] no but if you sending your spirit realm
[47:23] of your Millie reason conscious of
[47:25] actions and things then you're not lost
[47:30] he's got a trouble your body get up sin
[47:37] no I just meant running what do you buy
[47:39] over this bloody w gotta motivate life
[47:42] that ain't rap tap somebody ahead put
[47:45] him in a coma you have a problem right
[47:51] you don't lust nothing did he's
[47:54] unconscious you see we you don't know
[47:56] yet never been booked and you worried
[47:58] about it either I'll just say it the
[48:02] body is dead without the spirit on it
[48:06] right but then you better consider
[48:09] instead of thank you that we're just the
[48:11] unit I'm used to so I'm not talking
[48:16] about that I'm talking about a part of
[48:17] you that is real amen the followers all
[48:24] after you die and go somewhere to remind
[48:28] that whether you are a Christian
[48:33] percenter either way a sinner has a
[48:42] celestial body but he's on the courage
[48:47] one item we're in edmonton christian
[48:50] hasn't stressful body under current
[48:52] opening right but doesn't matter than
[48:56] see that's what I'm trying to get you
[48:57] see he doesn't matter what are you
[49:00] talking about everybody in the world
[49:02] anybody they must be a soul dwelling
[49:08] within that body and spirit
[49:12] yeah and he's trying his best to get
[49:16] that soul to be warned again exactly
[49:22] what the two so people talk well rather
[49:27] than soul is just the nature the spirit
[49:29] that is not a quote i want it i want
[49:32] somebody to bring me that quote one
[49:37] quote anywhere in the message that says
[49:39] the soul is just the nature of the
[49:41] spirit you then come prophet of God said
[49:48] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[49:50] when you say just the nature of the
[49:52] Spirit you're making it just worth
[49:54] noting it has no meaning good that's why
[49:59] you're too so people believe in a change
[50:01] of a nature a conversion of nature you
[50:11] Cody said you so is the nature of your
[50:13] spirit that's all right if you get to
[50:17] New Bern right right remember the
[50:23] unclean spirit goes out of
[50:25] sanctification and remember your profit
[50:27] target that that's a very dangerous
[50:29] space the stays to be in his
[50:31] sanctification because you start
[50:34] becoming a religious person a good
[50:37] Pharisee want to go to church want to
[50:40] live right and do right he sitting still
[50:42] lost that's why we need a new verb
[50:49] that's why I scream at you for 40-some
[50:52] years if you don't have the new bird
[50:57] you're lost right what are you putting
[51:01] it on I believe the prophet let's show
[51:05] me where the brother Brown said that was
[51:06] the ending he said it was whether or not
[51:09] the spirit of you agrees with the word
[51:14] agrees means continually agree means to
[51:18] going to be sympathetic with it to group
[51:21] agrees that's why I love cannot be the
[51:26] evidence of the Holy Ghost although you
[51:29] can't do away with love because you love
[51:34] with your spirit and there's people out
[51:38] there today is talking to one a doctor
[51:41] the man loves going with all of this
[51:43] being the only ones talk about is God
[51:48] wonderful people right make us ascending
[51:53] for sale
[51:58] yep give it a religious Society you say
[52:03] they say you're saying what the word
[52:08] says right you make up your mind to what
[52:10] I'm talking about but if you make up
[52:12] your mind or wrong way than you'd want
[52:14] to do stuff not many if that person is a
[52:18] born again Christian he will come to
[52:20] this next right if you don't go to this
[52:25] message he ain't born again let's write
[52:28] it up simple language easily understood
[52:32] I believe in Christianity I believe you
[52:36] must be born again I mean you must be
[52:38] justified sanctified and feel with the
[52:42] Holy Ghost at man then you just started
[52:47] oh she's just a baby but screw
[52:51] trichology desiring the sincere milk of
[52:56] the word to be able to grow thereby
[52:59] that's why I'm trying to get you to see
[53:02] what is the real you
[53:09] do you know you're sad what you are you
[53:15] don't never have wrong dollars you tell
[53:21] me you don't tell you lie no catch any
[53:24] problem I just tell you I know the only
[53:28] person they would have wronged us would
[53:29] have to be somebody that was in a
[53:31] comatose state because according to my
[53:35] profit even Jesus was tempted in all
[53:41] points as we are and the Prophet said
[53:43] even tempted in women he certainly
[53:50] wouldn't allow it was he the war was
[53:54] Satan tipped in the math through the
[53:56] body into the spirit not in his soul
[54:01] that sold turned right back around city
[54:03] get behind me yep would you understand
[54:09] what I'm saying the fifth seal is the
[54:11] greatest portion of scriptures to show
[54:16] what you really are right and how
[54:21] salvation is involved
[54:25] because it's what I was describing I
[54:27] want to go no matter what portion of
[54:29] people you are there must be a form of
[54:31] salvation it's all paid for by the blood
[54:36] of Jesus crouch even though the Old
[54:39] Testament people all right their sin was
[54:41] pushed forward right to Calvary the
[54:46] Bible says Jesus cried out what once
[54:49] more all are we gonna do is exactly so
[54:56] they look at the fifth seal we can find
[54:57] do we really are great gotta do those
[55:02] that's what people say they're worried
[55:07] that I do with us I don't want me I'm
[55:11] sorry but you know the book of Acts Lana
[55:16] do this that's back under yeah
[55:23] genesis x is the backyard max Rome's
[55:30] greatest relation bc that's that counter
[55:38] we understand what I'm doing so you said
[55:42] we don't need this we don't need that
[55:47] dividend we know and for sure to need
[55:49] all applies right then we have to be
[55:53] borne by the Word of God and then that
[55:55] way we can read that Old Testament well
[55:57] as than you when you tell the woman's
[56:01] room for work pants that ain't in the
[56:04] New Testament hats in the old one and we
[56:07] ain't under that no mower I thought
[56:17] the Jesus come to mind if nothing on
[56:19] Friday man over the Old Testament Ron
[56:26] working for a woman in the New
[56:31] Testaments magnified per diem back about
[56:34] Trump right okay any problem hey
[56:40] brothers they love thank the old
[56:41] testament to you know at the same time
[56:45] they said for a woman not to work or
[56:46] McCain to make their a man not to wear a
[56:49] garment pertaining to a woman same
[56:53] scripture we don't want that breeze do
[56:58] you guys only much it guys imma felt I'm
[57:03] not a guy but listen why do we go
[57:11] through and we were covering where the
[57:13] prophets it this does a wedding with a
[57:16] doctrine people has the fifth seal
[57:19] revelation the doctor is so creepy
[57:26] he said no sold or not dead nor alive
[57:31] see the field seals you if they're still
[57:34] opening those away with that let's read
[57:37] a little bit on man but I'll try to get
[57:40] you to see who you are it'll bother me
[57:44] prick 10 years on once the road runs in
[57:46] one scripture one given one seal tie the
[57:49] entire Bible again who's talking about
[57:53] the real Carter thanks lets it run said
[57:55] I can take a three-leaf clover preach 25
[57:57] years I believe it don't you I believe
[58:02] you can do me we can take a three-leaf
[58:09] clover to nothing with room for lease I
[58:11] look what he says it for 35 37 38 on
[58:17] them of the field seal he said I do not
[58:20] name but I do think really by the
[58:24] opening this cos i believe it's open to
[58:27] us I did it with good conscience with
[58:29] clear revelation before God not trying
[58:32] to just make it think because I always
[58:34] was against organization there were we
[58:37] belong to them which is open to me name
[58:40] and I do make another thing by the
[58:42] opening the fifth seal in this day
[58:45] straightens up and doctrine right here
[58:48] then I might sneak off I'm thrown
[58:51] treatment now believe it there's people
[58:54] in here that does believe that the
[58:57] anisole sleep I they just disprove that
[59:00] they're not sleeping they're alive their
[59:03] bodies Earth's are sleeping but the
[59:07] souls not in the grain there in the
[59:10] presence of God under the altar
[59:13] now even the fifth seal Jew is under the
[59:19] altar you can't put them in the fifth
[59:23] dimension because you knew that you will
[59:24] get it in a minute you got them with the
[59:25] center data so you got a problem you
[59:28] don't have to put them somewhere you
[59:29] better put them in the sixth dimension
[59:31] you better put all the redeemed in the
[59:33] sixth dimension you better put the bride
[59:35] in the sixth dimension because run
[59:38] around him when he went beyond the
[59:39] curtain of time yeah that's where Jesus
[59:41] wouldn't he said he's hired he said you
[59:42] can't go that right honey look the other
[59:49] way it was sold sleeping but brother I
[59:50] didn't know them about that one before
[59:52] you heard of this message what did you
[59:54] think about when you died well I really
[1:00:00] never thought about that's about as
[1:00:03] youth ball an answer it can be cuz you
[1:00:08] did think about you never wonder where
[1:00:12] you come from where you going
[1:00:17] you didn't wonder like that why am i
[1:00:21] where am I going I guess I'm the only
[1:00:25] goofball in the crowd the image but
[1:00:29] always wondered I always wanted to know
[1:00:33] about Who I am and where I come from and
[1:00:39] what I'm here for we see basics of
[1:00:44] organized religion believes the soul
[1:00:46] leaves the body no red probably say we
[1:00:49] all know what does it happen to whatever
[1:00:51] happens it just leads out everything's
[1:00:53] needed now they wouldn't talk about six
[1:00:57] dimension sold on the altar very much
[1:01:00] might have some that would endeavor to
[1:01:03] speak on it at times but basically you
[1:01:06] just go to the other day for you to hit
[1:01:07] your mouth
[1:01:12] it's like I tell you know I know I get
[1:01:14] in trouble saying it when you go to the
[1:01:15] Undertaker you look down in there and
[1:01:17] you say don't you look do it no I don't
[1:01:18] look good in the evil day I know what
[1:01:23] you're saying they got a good job fixing
[1:01:25] them up you know they look natural but
[1:01:28] other day we see the Bible says they
[1:01:32] didn't know nothing or no not see we
[1:01:35] took that as being that once I some how
[1:01:37] much we just we're gum go we never
[1:01:40] talked about getting it all back
[1:01:42] together and making a white rum we
[1:01:45] didn't know much about that we didn't
[1:01:47] want to know much about that the basics
[1:01:51] of all religion is that the soul is just
[1:01:54] you're just going when you die so the
[1:02:00] Prophet covers who it was teaching that
[1:02:03] look for 37 he said it was brother here
[1:02:09] I slid the author of Daniels revelation
[1:02:12] taught it like that the great teacher
[1:02:15] huh then he goes home down we read in a
[1:02:18] minute that the the seventh day
[1:02:19] adventist people that's what they
[1:02:21] believe you bro not when I look he said
[1:02:25] he was trying to support sold sleeping
[1:02:27] now this year I Smith and that said
[1:02:33] there is no nobody say there's no altar
[1:02:36] of sacrifice in heaven the only order
[1:02:41] spoke on that he believes is in heaven
[1:02:43] is the altar of incense now that's what
[1:02:45] the man talk need to disprove the fact
[1:02:49] that you you would be something these
[1:02:51] are but you did people not too different
[1:02:54] with my brother you said I want to
[1:02:56] immediately great teacher but it
[1:02:58] disproves the open you this sealed in
[1:03:00] the last days you just takes old
[1:03:02] sleeping prom another way see they are
[1:03:04] they're alive they're not dead
[1:03:07] right you notice this is not if there's
[1:03:11] no altar of sacrifice in heaven number
[1:03:15] of rounds proving a point run if there
[1:03:17] are no altar of sacrifice in heaven
[1:03:19] where is the sacrifice for sin lane then
[1:03:26] lamb see there have to be a place where
[1:03:30] the slain lamb bloody is letting the
[1:03:33] higher and sort of lovely his gotta be
[1:03:39] dry desert weather so sleeping so he
[1:03:42] said on the next we'll go ahead number
[1:03:44] eight questions an answer it on real to
[1:03:48] of 1954 103 evening / have 24 he said to
[1:03:52] adventist people believe that when a man
[1:03:54] dies and he goes right into the gray and
[1:03:56] stakes are so old body and everything
[1:03:58] until the resurrection and they call
[1:04:00] that so Cleveland no see that's where we
[1:04:04] ended up at now to stop inland sold
[1:04:07] sleeping he said that's not true it's in
[1:04:11] their mind you they were right out for
[1:04:14] revenge you they still have their
[1:04:19] feelings then what everything's Richie
[1:04:24] bobble
[1:04:28] if they've seen right they won't ever
[1:04:31] beat me that's what I'm saying we're not
[1:04:36] we're just not talking about eternal
[1:04:38] Christians and what it is I'm just
[1:04:41] trying to get you to see who we are man
[1:04:45] you should realize yourself what you are
[1:04:50] and what makes you motivated but pushes
[1:04:56] you what God you why are you here
[1:05:03] tonight right right Thompson guided you
[1:05:08] that there
[1:05:13] the way but everybody else was about the
[1:05:15] palace but brother Dale we want to know
[1:05:17] what we were yeah we was before the
[1:05:19] world you know I just figured you
[1:05:23] remember how about him put his hand even
[1:05:27] thought he was reincarnated no but lets
[1:05:33] the church what is this old
[1:05:41] right this is what I want to get into
[1:05:43] redemption do you realize there is no
[1:05:46] there's references to these thing but
[1:05:49] there's no soul of God mentioned in the
[1:05:53] Old Testament now come on don't go in
[1:05:57] our bed it and Rosco thirst identity and
[1:06:00] all that I'm talking about frankly the
[1:06:02] scripture they were if so was that
[1:06:05] pressure it would talk about a spirit
[1:06:08] right you would even talk about it the
[1:06:10] apne form which is even Jesus Christ
[1:06:14] Kenny dark was so Allah Almighty God is
[1:06:21] not just a body and spirit with a very
[1:06:25] soul of all money gone that's all what
[1:06:29] the hell for you and I that I don't have
[1:06:33] to go and paint my prices come up and
[1:06:39] see if he went for me then why can't you
[1:06:42] quote that scripture worse I'll not
[1:06:44] leave David he wouldn't gonna leave my
[1:06:50] soul and I don't that he made sure I
[1:06:55] didn't have to go
[1:07:01] what are you
[1:07:04] the much what the Prophet had to say on
[1:07:07] a message called faith we give this
[1:07:09] number system and the way the soul is
[1:07:12] that part of you who knows and
[1:07:14] understands your intelligence you say
[1:07:20] well neither do you really know about
[1:07:21] one of that's true well I'm glad you had
[1:07:23] it in your mind cause you remember the
[1:07:26] vision I had not long ago he's
[1:07:32] describing the soul and telling you
[1:07:34] that's working win right the vision of
[1:07:38] translation one in that place saw those
[1:07:40] people now your spirit will come back to
[1:07:42] that body and that that kind of a body
[1:07:45] the soul which is the body that does not
[1:07:47] have to eat and so forth if this earth
[1:07:49] I'm an item it is all we have one way a
[1:07:52] celestial body then with that spirit
[1:07:54] that sold a celestial body you rise up
[1:07:57] again in again this natural body for
[1:07:59] that great millennium so what is the
[1:08:02] soul it's a part of you that makes you
[1:08:08] work an animal has a intelligence but he
[1:08:14] doesn't have a soul that's the
[1:08:18] difference in him in the human being and
[1:08:20] that's why in the Old Testament the
[1:08:22] animal life could not pay them could
[1:08:24] only pay to cover the price no no soul
[1:08:29] in the animal to come back in it right
[1:08:31] there the Old Testament science amen
[1:08:33] right you only have one Jesus Christ
[1:08:37] Kenny right alright so what is it so
[1:08:41] number two
[1:08:46] 1961 1231 one serves you must be born
[1:08:49] again program 111 I'm so good or bad dad
[1:08:54] doesn't change its right I had a lot of
[1:08:59] sense what about people thinks I'm bad
[1:09:00] here but when I get to heaven defend
[1:09:02] will be alright good Catholicism nothing
[1:09:08] much word with Catholicism he said he
[1:09:11] had a lot of wrote it down we want to
[1:09:12] come Leon what is the soul what is it
[1:09:14] sold its you I'm at funny your soul the
[1:09:22] park inside of you and when you die ever
[1:09:25] watch shape that souls in that's the way
[1:09:28] it goes he goes through its destination
[1:09:30] you couldn't pull it up no matter how
[1:09:32] much you do for it that's old got to be
[1:09:35] chained here are going to give them that
[1:09:38] number 11 you don't up for 63 in the
[1:09:42] souls that are in prison now I got 36
[1:09:46] now the soul of man is not the volume
[1:09:48] manage the soul Seether so is something
[1:09:51] that's the nature of the Spirit amen
[1:09:54] then when the nature of a man when he
[1:09:59] said we are dead the scripture finally
[1:10:02] telling us we are dead and our lives are
[1:10:06] heating God through Christ still there
[1:10:08] by the hood spirit that wasn't that your
[1:10:11] body died it wasn't your spirit died it
[1:10:16] was the nature of your spirit died see
[1:10:18] the nature which is the soul now look de
[1:10:23] Marville a statement the nature of your
[1:10:25] soul is God if you're born again
[1:10:31] if not it's on the world accorded that
[1:10:38] to a man who told you many time in
[1:10:40] jeffersonville in the end of it was a to
[1:10:42] sole person i quoted it to him and he
[1:10:44] said well how can a nature have a nature
[1:10:46] because it was in nature and so and they
[1:10:50] saying this old is just the nature I
[1:10:53] don't know once you argue another brand
[1:10:55] for that because he said if you're born
[1:10:58] again then make sure your soul is gone
[1:11:01] if not the nature of your soul is the
[1:11:05] devil there's no in between there's no
[1:11:09] gray areas we belong to one or the other
[1:11:15] lift the necklace there are souls in
[1:11:18] prison but that's all that's in our see
[1:11:24] that soul is what God and working on the
[1:11:29] deadly not working on your body you can
[1:11:33] be annoying it on your spirit every day
[1:11:35] your life and I go to hell right let
[1:11:40] around send him in the door with him
[1:11:43] African dates in these days you go down
[1:11:48] and watch Georgia play any dates yeah
[1:11:54] we're that from your spirit to what if
[1:12:04] he can only get that nature that spirit
[1:12:07] to agree with him then that makes your
[1:12:10] died the nature of the world eyes and
[1:12:12] the things of the world is day Z because
[1:12:14] if you are the world of things of the
[1:12:15] worldly love of God is nothing the man
[1:12:18] must be born again so this money Nature
[1:12:20] has to die and the nature of God comes
[1:12:23] and lives in you and God is your mailing
[1:12:25] list never have again your needs me to
[1:12:29] an army soul is what God is working on
[1:12:36] you know working on your body's not
[1:12:38] working on your spirit we're going to be
[1:12:40] sold with use your inter meeting
[1:12:44] redemption is only in the soul you're
[1:12:47] not born again your body you're not
[1:12:49] going to get in your spirit your morning
[1:12:51] getting your soul oh that's a rearview

[1:12:57] are sinner you have a place to go to
[1:13:05] and if you're a sinner you have a
[1:13:09] celestial part of you called your soul

[1:20:10] like a roll of this you're really like
[1:20:13] more the beans each one is a great
[1:20:17] conglomeration of gaiety and blackness
[1:20:20] and darkness mortals live in you now
[1:20:23] they're either influenced room this way
[1:20:26] are from that way so you know he doesn't
[1:20:30] do much north of time going up now more
[1:20:36] of in here there are either influence in
[1:20:39] this way from that way you cannot be
[1:20:42] here a spiritual being said our site
[1:20:45] without having an influence from the
[1:20:48] underworld are from the above world if
[1:20:52] your influence from here to must be
[1:20:55] pulling up no you're from above your
[1:20:58] celestial body is lighting up here but
[1:21:01] if you're wicked and hypocritical in
[1:21:03] ever your celestial body is down here
[1:21:06] okay regardless of how much you think
[1:21:09] he's up that because the fruit that you
[1:21:12] by our booth much you are no that's your
[1:21:15] inheritance no need so your soul astral
[1:21:20] body even hear of the iron her down here
[1:21:23] that's first Corinthians 15 40 by seven
[1:21:27] these narratives go ahead joel is in the
[1:21:34] 5th division I repeated this one number
[1:21:40] 19 another thing of the mission is where
[1:21:44] the center unbeliever dies and go to the
[1:21:46] field amazing not a well like a horrible
[1:21:48] world but Grayson dies he goes into the
[1:21:51] sixth inning all right now look up
[1:21:59] number 20
[1:22:00] and what's the difference a celestial
[1:22:04] body for a center our site is the soul
[1:22:09] right right good evening are you with me
[1:22:15] this year so now that bunch of scripts
[1:22:18] are saved were to divide the difference
[1:22:21] if it's upwards of God these downwards
[1:22:24] is of the world we just read that right
[1:22:26] now we know if I heard the house of this
[1:22:29] time and that word is all we got in
[1:22:31] other words we have a built in God and
[1:22:33] the house not made with hands eternal in
[1:22:37] the heavens you don't speak of a center
[1:22:41] having a turn place but a Christian has
[1:22:48] an eternal place which is eternal life
[1:22:51] work in the soul in its own
[1:23:00] retirado said that when I would cut out
[1:23:03] a few your brother's run the when God
[1:23:07] breathed into the nostrils of Adam this
[1:23:09] is often the young blasphemous names he
[1:23:15] said Adam became a living soul he said
[1:23:19] specially don't run in especially when
[1:23:22] especially you need computer especially
[1:23:24] into Adam eternal life he had you turn
[1:23:34] life in his soul he said we had I the
[1:23:40] only died and body come on cuz I'm on it
[1:23:48] he said Adam died did he ever way died
[1:23:50] yet sacrifice he said that's why we
[1:23:57] struggle for eternal life look we're
[1:24:02] finally we struggle for it is becoming
[1:24:07] first out we need it within what you get
[1:24:10] it why would you struggle you won't
[1:24:11] struggle for it you love it it is part
[1:24:17] of you they must go through the
[1:24:19] lifestyle get through
[1:24:22] okay now run around and said while I
[1:24:25] pulling up number 22 but a random said
[1:24:27] that Jesus is sold his theophany Lee's
[1:24:32] being went to hell I proved it to you
[1:24:36] the other day they brought around beyond
[1:24:38] the curtain of time the angel of the
[1:24:41] Lord referred to that is sold under the
[1:24:43] altar and said he reserved referred to
[1:24:49] it the one it was standing there with
[1:24:50] you now that's not so go to the altar
[1:24:55] crying how long run around you to
[1:24:58] soldier on the outer 40 sometimes
[1:25:00] they're not referring to the field
[1:25:04] shields you the field shields you
[1:25:06] doesn't say sold under the altar crying
[1:25:08] how long it says souls of them that were
[1:25:13] beheaded crying when you say souls under
[1:25:18] the altar as the writer Jesus Christ
[1:25:20] those he said to one standing there with
[1:25:23] him said he said this is so company
[1:25:26] hunker never thinking that filter he
[1:25:29] said this is the scripture
[1:25:35] so your soul is you'd be apne now listen
[1:25:42] the apne is a celestial form so if
[1:25:48] you're a sinner your Diaw finish taking
[1:25:50] you down you're a celestial body of
[1:25:53] taking your name and be called it
[1:25:56] theophany the prophet will use the word
[1:26:01] but then when you're going upward your
[1:26:04] celestial has an upward pull your soul
[1:26:08] and you sold as you theophany the
[1:26:11] brother how he thought might be apne was
[1:26:13] up yonder what was Jesus its the Omni up
[1:26:16] there or was it within him come on amen
[1:26:21] I asked you a simple question that fry
[1:26:22] your soul is the Omni went to hell right
[1:26:26] so now your soul is your fiancée amen if
[1:26:31] you're born again is going upward you're
[1:26:34] not as good then you say yeah let's see
[1:26:39] brother Brown who says the Bible says is
[1:26:41] equal 18 40 sold are mine Satan cannot
[1:26:47] create a soul he perverts the nature of
[1:26:50] it cannot create we ought to get a few
[1:26:55] things settled in our mind if we're born
[1:26:59] again as we read and sold in prison
[1:27:02] you're all right you're not now watch
[1:27:05] what he says forgot to 70 to 79 on the
[1:27:11] Hebrews chapter 20 correct 7557 823 now
[1:27:17] the low cost that went out of God which
[1:27:20] was the logos all this begin to form
[1:27:22] into a body shape and this body shape
[1:27:26] was called in scholars teaching low gosh
[1:27:29] the logos that went out of God in other
[1:27:33] words a better word for it with what we
[1:27:36] call it the apne
[1:27:39] the army of the human body this
[1:27:42] glorified listen not exactly what
[1:27:45] flexing blood like it will be in his
[1:27:48] glorified state well there is a form of
[1:27:56] a human body that doesn't need neither
[1:27:59] does it great but it's a body a body of
[1:28:02] is wedding for us as soon as we leave
[1:28:03] this one now iam Barry entered into that
[1:28:06] body that's that kind of body that God
[1:28:10] was when we live here going up we gonna
[1:28:14] do the body like God was where he said
[1:28:19] let us make man in our own image in our
[1:28:22] likeness worth in it Genesis someone
[1:28:26] right now when man become into that body
[1:28:33] now we didn't even come into the body
[1:28:36] that would make the lifeless he had
[1:28:42] control of the fishes and the files in
[1:28:44] the beasts of the field and then there
[1:28:47] was no man that killed us all yes it to
[1:28:50] be done late male and female but there's
[1:28:53] no man that killed soul to a major
[1:28:55] structural members right which was in
[1:28:58] the image of God which is the theophany
[1:29:00] which is also all roads are probably
[1:29:03] said we're creating before the
[1:29:04] foundation of the world you need to
[1:29:07] quote i gave it like suede go back to
[1:29:09] that tape did God make man out of the
[1:29:13] dust of the earth you gave him a hand
[1:29:15] like a like a chimpanzee did with foot
[1:29:17] like a burn he knew him he made him on
[1:29:20] the image and this earthly body is in
[1:29:23] the image of animal life and it's made
[1:29:26] out of the same kind of material your
[1:29:28] body is made just a son kind of material
[1:29:31] as a horse or a dog or anything like
[1:29:32] that it's made out of calcium nice
[1:29:36] petroleum constantly but you're just on
[1:29:39] flesh like that
[1:29:41] the same flesh it's different place now
[1:29:43] you know what he's talking about birds
[1:29:44] in one place where another / dr. no
[1:29:46] flesh come on you know what he said made
[1:29:48] out of the dust of the earth where it
[1:29:51] come from but the difference between an
[1:29:53] animal and a man God put sold in a man
[1:29:57] he didn't put it in the animal because
[1:30:00] the soul that was in a man is that
[1:30:04] theophany then the soul is it a mayhem
[1:30:11] vote so when God create Adam you
[1:30:15] creating first a spiritual being
[1:30:18] secondly and naturally in the net the
[1:30:22] spiritual being would put in the natural
[1:30:24] being made him ruler of the earth make
[1:30:30] them an amateur God brother I've always
[1:30:34] been taught my soul not the OP knees at
[1:30:36] the other that's where you've been
[1:30:39] taught by people and they know what to
[1:30:40] tell me about it amen show me what it
[1:30:45] Robert says is up top man
[1:30:51] you missing the scripture it says if
[1:30:54] this earthly Tabernacle question were I
[1:30:58] stents dissolved we have a body waiting
[1:31:05] nothing written good English
[1:31:12] oldest at the off your main if it
[1:31:16] goes down is this theophany if it's
[1:31:19] going up this is the often it and God
[1:31:23] never put into man plus theophany of his
[1:31:27] own being to take him down Lee what is
[1:31:33] that the off me brother branham he said
[1:31:36] gotta hold up better hands and when it's
[1:31:38] time not better eyes you said well hon I
[1:31:43] didn't know they had hives but when
[1:31:45] brother Brown went beyond the curtain of
[1:31:46] time he could see a little difficult
[1:31:48] they were beautiful women he could see
[1:31:50] and they were trying out my precious
[1:31:52] brother if you had to come you were
[1:31:59] talking to him because they were in the
[1:32:03] theophany and he wasn't there in body
[1:32:06] but body was laying open hey you stole
[1:32:12] the theophany Liz me he said I can tell
[1:32:17] you as a one person he said it like it
[1:32:20] he said I been to both places you
[1:32:25] remember when he was shot near just a
[1:32:27] kid he was the one I am yeah he said
[1:32:30] I've been to both legs he said what you
[1:32:32] don't want to come back
[1:32:36] all right now what is it folks your soul
[1:32:40] is a Sir Leicester a part of you it's a
[1:32:43] part of you that makes you serve worship
[1:32:45] God even go over the Hottentots of
[1:32:48] Africa into the jungles they never heard
[1:32:50] the name of Jesus and it works if its
[1:32:51] upright why because of the soul that is
[1:32:55] within that person is longing out for
[1:32:58] his creator and then why can't you see
[1:33:00] that what venue is crying out seasonings
[1:33:05] when you get born again God puts eternal
[1:33:08] life in you we just read said eternal in
[1:33:11] the heavens you have eternal life in
[1:33:16] your soul by the new birth through your
[1:33:19] shoulders your theophany the person of
[1:33:22] your being if you're born again is going
[1:33:25] up with because theophany means a
[1:33:31] manifestation of God
[1:33:37] or a deity
[1:33:42] so when we were sinners we had a god
[1:33:47] better known as a devil and he was in
[1:33:52] our soul amen making that so perverted
[1:34:00] but when we got born again God comes in
[1:34:03] the soul drives the devil out now our
[1:34:07] theophany is going upward we have the
[1:34:11] new birth do you see you can take the
[1:34:13] fifth seal the pricks anywhere from the
[1:34:16] man you priests read n from don't
[1:34:19] realize you can preach salvation from
[1:34:23] the fifth seal you're tied together the
[1:34:26] entire Bible to find out who we are what
[1:34:31] we're doing david knew enough to say my
[1:34:36] soul thirsteth after the oh god run run
[1:34:41] said the only thing he needed was the
[1:34:43] new birth then they said that word how
[1:34:47] about him in my heart and I'm I'm not
[1:34:49] sin against thee you needed the new
[1:34:53] murder but that animal had no life to be
[1:34:57] able to be taken out David could give
[1:35:00] this animal sacrifice it was covering
[1:35:03] but when jesus paid the price David
[1:35:06] would be able to be taken and paradise
[1:35:09] would be emptied out as the old saying
[1:35:11] he has done away with Wow because it was
[1:35:13] taken up the soul of David an umbrella
[1:35:18] resting Abraham walking around there
[1:35:20] said sarah said we got to get out of
[1:35:22] here they will recognize us know who you
[1:35:24] want to say when Abraham looked like
[1:35:25] that's not what he's talking about we're
[1:35:29] talking about they were dying to be able
[1:35:30] to walk through the walls be able to
[1:35:32] move dude if you'da seen them in some
[1:35:35] more you know something was going on if
[1:35:42] we gotta get out of here will be
[1:35:45] recognized
[1:35:47] me you see the soul will come eternal
[1:36:00] you'll never be destroyed but if it's
[1:36:04] not eternal it will have the second
[1:36:10] death which is the death of the soul as
[1:36:16] I say that moment ago when we were
[1:36:17] serving the devil he was are gone now
[1:36:22] we're serving an eternal God commun hail
[1:36:25] within us the very life of Almighty God
[1:36:28] so our shoulders are kionda the Genesis
[1:36:35] 126 man right let us make man that was a
[1:36:39] spiritual image right come on then it
[1:36:43] was put into a natural body in the
[1:36:46] garden right and Adam had eternal life
[1:36:49] leading the animals and funny you and I
[1:36:53] come in the world at a mortal being set
[1:36:57] it to death we can receive the new birth
[1:37:00] our soul becomes eternal now that
[1:37:06] spiritual image that God had at me
[1:37:08] before the world it's not caught up with
[1:37:10] me right let us make man in our only
[1:37:16] image let them not just one I believe
[1:37:22] had eternal life whether you believe it
[1:37:24] or not I did because she was assigned
[1:37:26] soul is out of my dear brother branham
