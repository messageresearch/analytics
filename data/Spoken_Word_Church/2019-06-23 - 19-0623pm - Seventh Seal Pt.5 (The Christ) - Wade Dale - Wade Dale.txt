rented a great big lodge in Roberts town I guess you might call it it's right there at unicorn State Park sleeves 25 people at least that's the minimum it has basketball courts it's got horseshoe pits it's got barbecue pit it's got an outside pavilion and it's 10 minutes from Helen and 20 minutes from where we used to go fishing so it's right there where we can just go fishing and and but it will be Thursday Friday and Saturday next year of the Father's Day weekend that's June the 18th through the 22nd if we're still here we're going if not they can keep that deposit right registers they keep that deposit it was a pretty hefty deposit I thought well that'll help them through the tribulation if we get out of here which I hope we do and I hope they can use it so but if they don't we're gonna use it on that Father's Day weekend some say brother Dale again for and your input on where to go so god bless you also remember next Sunday June and I'll be gone will be at brother Richard Hyatts and

Thursday morning he called me Thursday about all 10 or 11 o'clock and he had passed down didn't in the airport so they had to they called his doctor and the doctor at the airport said he was dehydrated so I don't know if he continued on to brother Hildebrandt's or not but but just keep him in your prayers he needs prayer his body his body needs prayer he has he has wore that he's wore that car out a man driving miles and staying up late and driving home late but you know what that means zero to God he can restore him right back and he will I believe will restore him right back so just keep him in your prayers all right so god bless you let's turn the revelations eight and let's get started continuing with the Seventh Seal part five we're gonna talk a little bit about the Christ we were talking about the voice last Sunday and that's something just kind of struck me this week I think maybe why we were standing up sitting up there and in the cabin just kind of meditating a little bit so let's bow our heads before we get started the Lord Jesus thank you for this day thank you for these that are standing in front of me today Lord there's a purchase of your blood and they have been for Dane and predestinated to be here today to listen and to respond to you speaking your word about them father you said you would never leave us or forsake us and you have not you have filled us with the Holy Ghost or that you can be right there with us the whole time and father I pray that you would anoint us all today Lord the hearer and the speaker let it be you does the speaking and only you can do the revealing father just be with us in this service Lord take care of each one we all have many needs throughout this building Lord physical financial spiritual many needs Lord we're needy people but father you said you'd never leave us or forsake us you'd be right there with us you'd never lay on us any more burden than we could bear father we must trust that father and have faith Lord we pray that you'd just be brother Joel Forney wherever he is Lord if he's continued on to Canada Lord we pray that you'd give him supernatural strength it's just Satan trying to stop a soldier from completing his mission and father we pray that you'd just be with him in an anointing keep him strong father we need somebody like brother Jewell was with the way that he goes and the way that he deals with people mile there's people sitting in this building that's been influenced by his ministry and father I pray that you'd just be with him Lord be with each one Lord that's not here the ones that are traveling the ones that are sick or just be with each one Lord the four foreign missionaries Lord as they go out give them fruit for their labor Lord touch each one forgive us of our sins Lord as we talk about you today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen revelations 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour also John 19 when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost we're gonna finally get to that scripture one these days Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto not until unto the day of redemption you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading his word well that was a good song that saying that brother-sister scene that was really good good to see sister Esther playing the piano and pray for other sister Esther because other sister Esther is on her way somebody forget to turn one off okay and thanks to brother Richard and brother Josh give them a pen clap right now this place if you didn't see the picture there was nothing on this stage last night or yesterday except that PN that was it nothing else they put ever this all this back together after the wedding and you know worked Richard did it all work yeah okay you wouldn't tell me if you did anyway yeah Richard back there doing this going to the bathroom wherever you go and going caught him in mid-stride but thank God that we have people that can take things apart and put them back together and they work you know sometimes men they put things together and there's a few parts missing or or like daddy always said where do these go after it's already been put together so read the instructions hey ma'am here we are in the seventh seal part five and we're gonna talk about the Christ now brother Dale has been doing an outstanding job he is he's just yep and lo and behold I tell you you talk about God working we went to brother Tim hems and brother Keith preached basically the same service that he did here but we were we took a little time of fellowship that evening went gone Waffle House and had some pie discussed the word of the Lord and brother Tim he said you know what he said I believe we're not preaching Christ to the people he said I think we need to go back and go through the plan of salvation and I said well guess what slowly brother Dale preaching the plan of salvation Amen so it must be needful because remember God doesn't do something and it has no effect now you say well it may not be affecting me well it's affecting somebody all right maybe it's not your turn but it is affecting somebody and I want you to realize that even in teaching the seals that you're teaching the plan of redemption it's just it's just maybe two more not like the baby form but maybe on into the mature form that we all need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then we need a refilling and then we need a refilling but it's remember it's not it's not Christ in the beginning and not Christ in the end it's Christ in the beginning cost in the end that's why that that's why that brother Branham says and we'll read it right here what is the opening of the seals revealing Christ okay so let's just read a couple of quotes here and then we're going to read some scripture about the Christ and make some comments on that if you don't mind I want to give a definition of the Christ so here we come to a place as number 1 says remember revelations chapter 5 says he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people that we were member other teeth were discussing this the other night and and sometimes people don't see that they really don't go on through and see that that Christ had got an inheritance inherit eternal life in his body he didn't have eternal life in his body when he walked on the earth but he inherited eternal life by being the Christ but being that that body died and he could come back into that body and raise him from the day then that made him eternal in body spirit and soul alright so but now he who did he do that for he didn't do it for herself he did it for me in you alright so he did it he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer so he had to become kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belong to him that's why that that's why that you see that Satan Satan can't do that Satan cannot do this he can't he wants to keep it all itself he's a selfish person but God as soon as he gets soon as he became kinsman redeemer he came for a purpose he came to get you but he didn't just come to get you so you could go pass away and God could raise you back up he came to give it back to the people the inheritance that he inherited alright he inherited eternal life in his body so being inherited then we're gonna talk about it here in Romans Romans 8 says we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ all right so whatever he gets we get you really try to I want to explain something here but let's go and read number 2 the breech preach one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals see every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals now brother branham said if you can't see wide in every verse Christ not Jesus Christ Christ we're gonna see what Christ is if you can't see Christ in every verse every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals so when you talk about a demeaning with garden you're talking about seals when you talk about Abraham you're talking about the seals when you talk about Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and Isaiah not your talk why because there's Christ on those people and knowing those people to do a job so you're talking about the seals but it was so sealed up till the seals cannot be broken until that time what the time of the seventh angel message which is what it's very specific it's now it's now like I said before many many mysteries even Paul talked about the mystery of the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory but he never heard anything about a seal but he was preaching about him while he was on earth but he was already dead and gone home when John got two seals in what was it ad whatever it was 90 something Paul had already passed on Paul never heard about a first seal second seal third seal fourth seal fifth seal sixth seal seven seven and then but he knew about one man Christ he knew about Christ he knew where he had come from now if there's one man that could take you through justification and sanctification in the baptismal oligos it was the Apostle Paul hey man Paul knew that when he got justified if God didn't forgive him for holding the coats come on somebody if God didn't forgive him for holding the coats of the people that stoned the very people he started preaching to if he didn't get forgiven for that there was no justification that's why Paul says those who had he has justified he is already glorified amen but there's a journey in there you know you thought about a journey you take in there and the Bible says those who he has justified he's already glorified now God says that about us and he's already seen us at the end but you and I didn't you can't see you're in from the beginning but you want you have a journey you have a daily journey a daily walk I told him downstairs if we were to be able to see from here to the body change we might not like that right we might not like that we might not like what's gonna happen but God knows and then we just live day by day that's why we live in Christ and we'll read some of that in just a few minutes because I want you to realize one thing it's a book of redemption it's a mysterious part of all the Bible that man has never been able to put together sure man has read it man has looked at it many people today will open this Bible and say those who he's justified he's already glorified and they point it to another day or to a happening to somebody else our grandma you know our great-great grandpa name never seen it well we're not gonna see it but we're gonna so push it no it's now yes today is the day of redemption today is the day of full redemption because the seven seals have been open and I want to make that real clear point that camera right here my face I want you all appoint them all right here whoever said that we didn't believe the Seventh Seal is opened as a liar a liar I listen I would not be go ahead I would not be standing here today if I know it was already open brother Dale wouldn't be standing in this pulpit if we didn't think the Seventh Seal was open you can't preach this message without the seventh seal being open now if you doesn't say it's not open it's not right you go next door deck but Donnie said don't be so hard yeah you got that right we'll be then just a little while but yeah I know I mean y'all offense I mean you you can't even preach even if you never preached about the seals in a specific you know like I'm doing in a series if the Seventh Seal which is Christ that's what we're fixing the day if the Seventh Seal is crossing you don't say if it's not open then you're not boarding in right I just let me put a period on that you're not boarding in so I don't know where anybody got that but but you know you can you know what you can preach your heart out and people say he said someone zone you said no incident so god bless you whoever said that and don't ever say it again it wasn't anybody in this church so let's give I hope it was if it was then anyway let's go to number three I just want to clear that up though because look the state wait we're we aren't in the part of the open book to say what is the opening of say opening it's revealing Christ listen you think we stand up being preached to reveal us me brother they are barbra Leone no but Louise no if they stand that's what a problem if a lot of problem is they stand up here and tell them about their self and they point what they put them to you you got a point across if you're not getting Christ then I don't know you're just not born again that's why brother Dale is preaching this maybe there is a question in somebody's mind whether you're born again or not all right because and it's just like brother you know you get you sat down with brother Tim him a brother that's you know three hours from here and he's totally told us specifically he didn't listen to nobody else on the internet and which is fine that's okay that's his prerogative but what I'm saying is if he would have heard what brother Dale was preaching then you could think well he you know compared to that B&E Perry said we're just not preaching Christ enough to the people I said well after brother Dale's preaching he said he said you really believe in justification saying I said yeah that's great cuz there's a lot of people don't listen you go around the list and people in this mess you just believe you just it's just like this water you just go and you got it dudes into a you believe the Prophet I mean so you're so you're boarding in you know but you don't cut your hair do you you don't wear pants do you do you do you don't you do you don't you forget that business it's all about Christ but look he's the one who opened those seals he is those seal now look let me be real clear if there are preachers that preach the Seventh Seal is not open they should be behind the pulpit number one cuz they're not born again and they're not gonna help their people we are a people of open book we are the people that have been shown everything everything that God had in his mind he holds nothing back from you and me okay nothing you and I are the recipients of the whole book John was a top of the bride right now the Bible says he ate the book now remember they what in the page or two or a chapter or two laying on the floor when he got finished he ate the whole book all right if he ate the whole book then it was open it became what John and John became the book he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of seals in revealing Christ so who is Christ let's go to the Greek lexicon and see what says about Christ I looked this up from from Genesis all the way in but do you know what the word Christ is not spoken in the Old Testament the first word Christ is in Matthew 1 that says something about Jesus Christ here's the generations of Christ Jesus generations Jesus Christ so Christ was it wasn't that he wasn't in the Old Testament but remember Christ is of what anointed christ meaning anointed was the messiah the son of god now remember he was in the old testament but he was not in a person in the old testament he was not in an individual in the old testament all right now excluding atom we know Adam had the Holy Ghost but he was given to him it wasn't a birth right Adam was not born he was a full-grown man when God created him all right and breed to his his nostrils the breath of eternal life and became an eternal person so what did he do but remember when he gave that book back to Christ or I love it when brother Branham told us he said Christ the Lamb Holy Ghost all the same person so you take all these things and you look at them in in in the not really in the message but - in the message some where you have two Lords and all these other things yeah we were talking somewhere we were talking something out of juice somebody meted you and was talking about it but it was Keith well Keith Reed was talking to you he said now you remembered that the juice stood up and say hey you remember he's only one God well see they got that right there's only one God brother branham occult talk to that Jewish guy says says you cut him up in three pieces and he said no no he said who be Messiah he's the Messiah we'll be gone alright even Paul when he was struck down on the road I was reading it just this morning I think it was when Paul was struck down he said who are you lord now he knew something was different he knew that wasn't just some kind of fog or light no it was a person because that person spoke back to him I am Jesus whom you persecute it alright so but so Paul had that and I love it we were downstairs you know doing in the book of Hebrews you see Paul remember Paul you and I are so fortunate to have all this background Paul had no background set in the Old Testament he took the Old Testament and made Christ a live person and preached in eighty percent of the New Testament is written by Paul about this man Jesus Christ who was not in the Old Testament per se you know he came in under the law we know that but he wasn't there with Abraham with Isaac with Jacob there wasn't a man called Jesus Christ right it was an anointing it was the anointing that anointed Moses so that Moses could watch speak in the first person but then when we were talking about this downstairs in the Old Testament you can type a lot of things but you cannot go all the way with your types because you can't have a prophet marrying the prostitute not in the New Testament okay right you can't have David being the apple of God's eye born again here listen born again and then look at a woman and commit adultery with her and then by premeditated murder which is capital punishment in the United States if you don't mind that's premeditated murder he had his friend killed his friend to cover up see that's not a born-again person that's that's what that's a man living through the Old Testament with an anointing on him but now remember like I said before we can't kick all them Old Testament people out and just say well they were just they were just filler just waste no that paradise was full of them and Jesus Christ went to them and it's theophany he went to them and brought them out of paradise and took them somewhere so he thought enough for them what they lived what brother Brown say brother Brown said why do we bark it flies fleas and frogs why do we bulk as believers as Christ being in us and here's Moses which also had a rap sheet hey man hey he all he had a rap sheet he was a murderer okay he murdered an Egyptian okay so here you got Moses but you got to remember when God comes over here it's kind of like with Abraham when Abraham was over here and he's the father of our faith he gives his wife away how many times sister Anna thank you twice she said it this morning twice yes he did he laughed at God there was a lot of times it looked like he doubted but when you bring him through into the New Testament what does Paul say about him strong in faith never wavered why because you looked back this way of you know what Paul was pulling him he was pulling him through the filter he was pulling him through the blood filter that says Abraham was a friend of God a perfect man an upright man but why did brother Brown say why do we bulk it at creating squirrels in other words and here Moses only had an anointing and create flies fleas and frogs say that 10 times flies for fleas and frogs and then you and I say well I don't know about this quit creating of squirrels we're already creators anyway we don't have to have listen we don't have to go find Christ he's right here he's in us he's talking to you today Christ is listening to his own self talk listen folks we can't fail if you have Christ inside of you and I have Christ inside of me and brother Dale with all these other ministers brother Bob always have crying you have Christ Christ is talking back and forth to itself right these are that are you're another person Christ meaning anointed was the Messiah the son of God now also it goes back to it goat it's Christos then it goes to Creole which means annoying - annoying you know what annoy means I know it means to smear own the smear own right to smear own because an anointing can be smeared on you like what brother Dale tell about this morning an anointing can be smeared on you but you can't have Christ inside of you and do the things people do but you can be annoying it or smear don't cuz that's what I know it means you look up the word I know it just keep looking it up it means to smear on because what does it only do when you anoint somebody you put oil or and it just runs all over them that means no anoint alright but it said but it also comes in here with Christ now watch consecrating Jesus to the Masonic office and furnishing him with the necessary powers for its administration and what did Christ do for you brother Brown called us little Messiah not a separate person and furnished us with the necessary powers for us administer what administration what of the Masonic office in doing and doing Christians with the gifts of the Holy Spirit alright so but anoint right really I know it means to smear on it just means to put on something all right put on something all right that's why you can be you I'm an anointing to preach and you have an anointing to pray for the sick and you have an anointing for gifts and you have anointing for this indifferent anointings that could be owned anointed ones but you can't have Christ inside of you and be an anointed one you can't have Christ in your soul brother tell something like this morning you can't Christ in your soul and being an only one you can be an anointed one but it's a good anointing one it's not a false anointed one right so you can be anointing for a lot of things listen folks we've seen a lot of people get anointed for a lot of things and then what happens to them you see them drift away or you see something happening in their life and they just disappear why they had an anointing on them they had something smeared on them but there was nothing inside of them to keep them all right so what we're looking at these seals when we look at these seals I want to tell you something though when we look at these seals listen to me just a minute we're talking about if you see the opening of the seal you're already born again this is a special anointing on top of that this is not I mean something like brother Brahim said he said he said your new birth and adoptions two different things so you get born again Dinos I mean you're automatically adopted no you're adopted into the family under tutors and governors until the time appointed of who the father who decides when to release the schoolmaster the father decides not the schoolmaster the schoolmaster tells the Father will the father can say well just keeping up the folly because they know we're done that's it but you you're under tutors and governors until the time appointed the father which is to me I say if you're born again have you been in this message and you've tried your best to grow up that statue of a perfect man mm-hmm you're not under tutors and governors anymore you saw what about preaching I ain't talking about that I'm talking about that I've know much you come to maturity to where you can understand you know like brother Tim and I were talking Thursday or Wednesday night and I've agreed with him for a while because we had this discussion a year ago why do we have to make a quote for everything that's right why do we have to make a quote I'm going to read you something here anyway but and I already read you some but that quote is to help the ones listen to me that quote is to help the ones that's not fully matured yet because fully matured Christians don't need a quote that hurts your feelings good thank you because if it did then you need it look if you have to have a quote then you're propping up something you're having to have enough no I mean I'm going to tell you today you and I are the closest to Christ anybody on this earth has ever been except Christ himself besides brother branham unless in iron and not even there not not in our knowledge of just knowing what page number what year it was preached in one paragraph no I'm talking about what you have inside of you that when somebody says something the wheels go turning and you can pull quotes but you pull them out of your head cuz you've got the essence of the message how many times have I ever told you that this letter will kill you the pages of this Bible will kill you but once that page that Bible comes inside of you and becomes an alive word when it becomes an alive word then you're the walking Bible and no one can take that from you no one let's read this mystery real quick on here now watch the seals revealing crops what is the Seventh Seal it is Christ we've come through this journey of justification sanctification of baptism Holy Ghost we've come to justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost in the pyramid my brother Dale said then now is a mysterious part of justification what is the mysterious efficient the baby form of justification is you did it you did it but it's gone well points you then don't you laughs no you did it and the preachers preaching to you and you know you did it amen but when you get that chopped off hallelujah amen but now you talk about justification in the form we're talking about in that part where the real you never done it we've got to be able to see that that in our born-again experience oh yeah Nord have mercy Satan can throw it in your memory what you did but how listen how can we believe what we believe and see that God he's forgot that you bring things up the Guardian even know hello you do God will never accuse you for something he's forgive you for ever he'll never bring it back up Lord I wish that with having us he'll never bring it back up he'll never rehash it he has moved on and he's took you with him if you'll go that salvation that's repentance that's true repentance it's done it's finished the light not alone Lord I don't want to knock the light out perfect it no it was Richard Gilder my going them never mind anyway blue devil I just noticed it was dark right there when I look back so I did it we need a work order Richard man yeah oh that one did it duly see what you did yeah we're all family that's okay but risk but listen when we talk about we're talk about these things we remember when when the Bible tells that it will he will bring to your remembrance whatsoever now look you cannot remember something that you don't know anything about you can only remember what you've read you can only remember what you went through but you got to remember God doesn't remember your past sins they're gone they're done they're finished what sins are you talking about some way I'll write a song about that Jim to explain to her after church okay anyway bless your heart okay who are we yet nope no really I mean what sins are you talking about you listen why listen that our problem is we rehash all this stuff I'm a little bit off here but I'm kind of helping you a little bit with what brother dad let's talk about in your journey what you've done yeah Satan is gonna absolutely every time you drive by the place you did something he's gonna go you remember that yes that be remember you got drunk that night and you God don't remember none of that and he'll never see that and he'll never bring that up so listen if it ever is brought up you know who it is you know who's come knocking at your door the devil and he's a liar he can remember it but God can't so you just tell him say look my daddy done forgot that my father's done forgot that I don't have to worry about it listen if you've truly repented now if you hadn't truly repented if you do want any more halfway Lord I'm sorry no if you truly repented though at justification though when you truly repent you know you know something happen you've got to know because God is obligated to show you what happened he is obligated cuz he your daddy he's your daddy in your journey and as you go through your journey he's the one that's gonna point out all the positive things sure he may give you a little stimulation in the in there in the backside every once in a while or back of the head you know he may say hey get back in line but you're not gonna kill you with it and he's not gonna say tomorrow you remember yesterday we're not no that's not God God forgives you of all that you say brother way what about that these sales these sales is telling you how pure you are now that there's a work already been done it's already finished and you've got to move into that and then that's where you'll see that the book is open because you become an open book a man you become an open book God begins to talk to you like brother Keith was preaching the other night about the non spiritual gifts hey it's for all of us and it's not just speaking in tongues and interpretation that's what we're talking about this morning everybody goes well you don't have any gifts in your church and nobody speaking in tongues and interpretation Billy Brown said that's the least of the nine one two three four five six seven are very important wisdom knowledge prophecy what else miracles faith we've seen that we got gifts working in our church why question yourself you have gifts working in the church you just might not have speaking in tongues and interpretation we will get to that or brother Brown said if you lay under the spout long enough you you'll be able to do that but we got to do it in order we can't do it out of order we do all these other things in order we might as well do that in order all right so that's to help the body of believers but let's not hone in on the life's too we have plenty of gifts of wisdom here Holy Ghost wisdom knowledge faith prophecy healing my heavens that means been healed in this building well good grief we got a miracle working group a bunch of people we got all kind of gifts working and yeah actually one gift is you stay awake long enough to hold your hand up I get to sleep the cloud remember I run them off and put them to sleep faster than anybody you ever seen Colossians 1:26 says even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations but now it's made for manifest to the world any what that said that ain't what that said I want him to put it on the strain even the mystery Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which has been hidden from ages this must be a mystery thank you but now it's made manifest to his Saints to his Saints to me and you not everybody else to men you remember folks this is a secret coming of Christ it's so secret the world will never know we're here and never know when we leave to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles what is this mystery Paul which is Christ in you the hope of glory the hope of glory is in you the whole hope why because you know what if we are if there was not one if Christ died walked out of the tomb went ascended and come back and nobody wanted or come back and everyone in nobody you got take 90% of the Bible and throw in the trash but he did come back we do believe he came on the Pentecost we do believe he came in 120 and out of that 120 you see the millions that you have today spiritual multiplication which is Christ in you not on you because remember we're going to read a couple now where it talks about false Christ which is crossing you the hope of glory whom we preach that's what I said if you're not preaching Christ or the Seventh Seal you know you can't preach without it being open oh yeah wait a minute let me put this way you preach on hand in dress and the do's and the don'ts you preach on that but you can't preach the mysteries of God to where somebody says Amen that's right and growing grace and knowledge you can do that that's what the problems being we spent 50 something years beating on the flesh and not getting down into the soul you get down in the soul of that individual I'll guarantee you we're gonna take a body change but it's gonna come from that soul it's not gonna come from you it's not gonna come from you wearing long sleeves and know this and that and you need to do this and you can't do it and they do it and won't doing what ant got to do and three inches above your knees below your knees you can't have higher than that you understand what I mean somebody preaching on tenth dress now that's a waste of time why would you assemble yourself to hear that but you know what that's what you had to come through I guess but what is that doing to edify the body it's all well it to me it just beats the people whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus every man perfect in Christ Jesus that's what we're working toward we're working toward you're never gonna have a perfect church but you can have perfect people in assert I'm just saying Matthew 24 and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh should no flesh be saved before the elects sake those days shall be shortened thank the Lord they're getting shorter anyway this is the middle of the year 2019 the middle of the year grief then If any man shall say unto you now look let's break this down because I went through this lifestyle 94 laughs a life sunny whatever it was and just kind of run through it but let's let's piece it out here then if any man shall saying so look that man doesn't know where Christ is that man if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ believe it not so that man right there is a false messenger yeah a false preacher shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's while false anointed and false prophets you know we we also will discussing some things and I'm just going to tell like it is you know everybody's saying so-and-so is a prophet and this one's the Prophet not was a prophet you know they could be false there was a school of the prophets in the Old Testament that followed Elijah around the whole time and they were never right except for one time they said we know your we know the life is Gor Elijah is going up today going to heaven but remember they had all this other stuff they made wild gourds and made the pot was full of death thank you and you understand one thing so if you say so and so's a prophet or his he said - he said his son was a prophet be careful he could be false I'm just saying cuz I will promise you one thing if a prophet says something and it's not right he's fault if you got in a word in plain black and white and he says something besides that he's false he might be a prophet but he's a false prophet all right you understand what I'm saying because the false prophet would never take you to the word a true prophet will always take you the word all right man and show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect listen this is so important jesus said behold I have told you before in other words verily verily I've told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in secret chamber believe it not do you know why you can call these people false prophets because the word in use is that ain't right so where's Christ in you that's the great mystery is that Christ can be in you looking at somebody that's false and saying what do you mean I got to go to so-and-so or I got to go over here and there the other the Christ inside of me tells me the word and if it's anything contrary to that it's false may be able to discern may be able to do all things but if he can't take you to the word he's false all right so for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and Shina Stevens in the West so shall also the coming of Son of Man be everybody got that let's go to Matthew 16 so how is the only way you're gonna know where Christ is how is the only way you are gonna know where Christ is he's right here I don't have to go to the desert I don't have to go over to this one I don't have to take that person's doctrine I run it through my filter and if my filter said it's wrong and it's according to the Bible then it's wrong what I've got the court of the Bible and read more Simon Peter answered and said we're gonna read something about Christ and will then will dismiss won't be too long cause they want to cover something else in a couple weeks and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now remember that's where Peter I mean Jesus said who the men say that I the Son of Man am and he says thou art the Christ in other words you're lis anointed but look what he done he could be a false anointed but you can't be the Son of the Living God and be false you cannot be a son of God and be false all right that's not of the Living God so see Simon told him thou art the Christ and haven't gotten in Jesus said hey that's right and I'm gonna build my church on that what the church on the day of Pentecost was birthed by Christ if you got born again yesterday you were by Christ all right so we didn't deviate from that at all you can't if you if you can hold that point watch this mark 941 boy so ever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name we quote that scripture a lot but we don't quote this part now listen not just ever I want to be real strong with this if if I'm not born again and somebody gives me a cup of water that don't mean they're going to heaven but if I belong to Christ amen whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward listen we use an example often about somebody helping you on the side of the road and different things it's not because of you come on it's not because of you it's not because you're some great person Christ is in you right what did what did what did brother Keith was talking about what did when Peter was sitting there and a nice come in he sat down and eyes he said you have what you have lied to the Holy Ghost you have lied to the Christ that's inside of me and you will not leave this plate when we know why brother Brian said we're coming back to that right so it's not just may you whoever brother Larry anybody know it's Christ in you the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory alright but if you belong to Christ barely on seeing you he shalt not lose his reward Romans 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God or the salvation to everyone that believeth not that you believe brother Branham was a prophet that will not send you to heaven they might send you somewhere else but you know why I know brother Brown was a prophet because he was a word prophet and every time he opens his mouth its Christ speaking to me and with a Christ in me says that ain't nothing but truth that was the Christ and sister had it right they said don't eat nothing but the crew but the truth right why do you say man why do you say men just cousin take the guy beside you does do you say man you're Amen in the word and it's because the word has agreed with what's being spoke to me that's very simple with you hear the word you got to be able to respond if you got the word inside of you you have to respond now you might respond by Barry you know a nod or you can you know get up and we're yet Bob you can get up and oh I told Bob he's gonna have to find a new job he can't do my water anymore because we take it out of the refrigerator so he's gonna be the the he's gonna keep you all awake no he's gonna be the worship way he's gonna be the one it's gonna get runny islands one of these days we're gonna get old Bob going and we'll just fall right in behind him but look now look watch the whole thing you got to take these two scriptures together from I'm not ashamed of the gospel Christ where is the pound regarding the salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for their in for their II and what the gospel of Christ for in the gospel of Christ is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith you know you have to believe I like what they put up here this morning where it had the sin and then it had faith we're brothers brother Joel I think that you have to have faith that that happened folks you have to be a believer to just believe that your past sins got listen it's got to be revealed to you and even a ranked center that comes in off the street and he gets up he can be justified because God sends you to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved odds are just shall live by faith if you believe that God's chopped off your past sins but you got to remember like brother Dale's preaching you got to be careful because that snakes still in there most people don't see it see most people I say most people live denominations you just come up shake a hand cry turn around whatever do ever whatever they say and then you're alright but see we had a prophet come along and says well you know that might be a good deathbed confession or or if you get justified and you die real quick you know you'll go to heaven go to heaven he didn't say Brian he said you go to heaven all right because your past sins been chopped off what do you think happened to the thief on the cross he was a thief they put him on a cross as a thief he was dying as a thief that's why he was on the cross he was a thief up until the moment he turned and said will you please just remember me when you get into your kingdom and Jesus said you come in with me I told him I said he's one of the he didn't spend the six free to here and spend with just a few minutes in paradise cuz when he died and went to paradise Christ died and went to paradise I mean went to hell and preach them will come pick him up and took him somewhere so he was not there very long but you know what we're gonna get to meet that guy yes we're gonna meet that guy [Applause] but be careful let's don't be all the thief on the cross and wait till the final moments trying to get can getting you know try to get saved because if you and I live another day that same root of evil still there if you just if you just get justified like what brother Dale was talking about but you still gotta have faith that God's chopped that because you have nothing except believing you have nothing else but you start reading the Bible than what you do brother Dale's won't get into this I hope about sanctification sanctification brother Brown said you become into a religious order your name goes on the book its scientific ation a lot of things happen to sanctification what to drive that unclean spirit out you got to be listening to something you got to be listening to something alright that drives that unclean spirit out now what happens is though he's you're not real serious and he comes back and he comes back religious and you'll set in a message pew and die and not even be born again but when somebody tells you that though like ability L said you know it now it's checking up time folks this is pencil sharpening time this is the time when you need to check on yourself you need to check on your household a man Bible says if you'll be serious he God saved that jailer in his whole house he said you and your household will be saved if you believe a man so what are we doing let's believe Romans 3 verse 22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God amen we're all in wouldn't be Paulo being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus it took Jesus Christ to start this Redemption ball rolling he man and then it took Jesus Christ to do that not just the Christ and not Jesus they were plenty of Jesus's back then thou art the Christ he identified who he was alright let's go to Roman's 6 hmm Romans is just full of Paul talking about Christ now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him if we'd be dead with Christ now look you can't be married to two at the same time we're gonna read that maybe a couple of Sunday's there's more about this in Corinthians but right here if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more now where is Christ where is Christ in you yes in your soul well then what death hath no more dominion over you for in that he died he died unto sin one time but in that he liveth he liveth unto God believe us now this Romans seven wherefore my brethren he also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another dead can't be married to two husbands it's the same two living husbands at the same time but if you have to be dead you can marry again all right that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God the body of Christ dead to the law by the body of Christ you know why because the law said you can't have two husbands living you have one dead you marry another Amen alright so you can't be married to Christ in the devil at the same time Romans 8 this kind of sums it all up but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit now what's he saying that we just everything's took out in the flat no you're still in your flesh okay but you're not in the flesh while we're not leaning toward the fleshly things but in the spirit if so be that's the Spirit of God dwell in you if so be now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him who Christ that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you so where's your body changed coming from it's gonna come from you but you gotta but remember if the Seventh Seal is revealing Christ he's got to be revealed to you in such a way that it's already been took care of I read to you a long time ago brother Bram said when Christ died on the cross you died with him when he rose you rose with him when he got a body change you got a body change potentially so it's already done that's why Paul could you know what Paul's looking at then he said oh my those who is justified he is already glorified there's a journey in there but who he who has started a good work Paul said we'll finish it so it is a good work well me and you come up and we're born again and we're baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ God baptizes us into the body guess what happens we're good work we might be a WIP working progress but we're working progress with Christ Christ is the one that's doing the work if we've what yield our members that's why I said you you're not in the flesh yeah you're in the flesh but you don't do the things that the flesh you do the things of the Spirit just what I said before about David David will not have done the things in the flesh that he did if he'd have been born again he wasn't murdered that best friend of his and had his wife in adultery he wouldn't do that amen that was when this that was when the anointing was on him but remember when you and I the anointing comes in us guess what that's it we're doing now next time do you what we'll do is we'll cover I don't want cover anymore we'll stop stop right there and I won't read that one more time break it back up again bring it up again listen let's read it one more time but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be if there's a big word if if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you who is that Christ now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of this and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin we know we were born in sin shaping and Nikoli all these things but the Spirit is life because of righteousness now if you stop right there then Paul has separated it and said your body is dead because of sin but your spirit of life because of righteousness there's no way for you to take a body change he separated them but watch Paul but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead you know what that day we talked about the resurrection day as the greatest day ever a man that was dead got a body change stepped out of a tomb and said all power and heavily nurse been given unto me that same person is dwelling in you that same person is dwelling in each and every one of you that have the new birth your resurrection lays inside of you the ones that have gone on brother Tatom brother tom sister hazel I don't brother Gary all the different ones and some brother Richard Marlo that's why you'll see them again that right there that scriptures why you'll see them again if that same spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by the spirit that dwelleth in you so what is the seventh seal you Christ in you it's the greatest mystery Satan cannot understand how that God is gonna do anything through you because he's always beating you telling you what you did do telling you what you should do and shouldn't do telling you do's and don'ts and do's and don'ts and Christ just said look I love you and if you'll just let me live inside of you all I'm doing is responding to myself that's what we really got to do we got to let Christ respond to himself why do you respond in a sanctuary now because you got a spark in you the same spark that's talking to you you got the same connection you've got a you got a you know you got the same one same person we hope it's the same person but why do we in also listen to another thing what what about you sitting in a service and you hear false doctrine how many have you done that and something goes off inside of you that says some things not exactly right now you want to listen you don't want to be sitting there be a critic but you want to let God lead you and if you're if you're listening you go I mean how many times that ever happened to you the very reason you raised your hand knowing the false doctrine was preached to you is because you saw because maybe the other people said besides every was like this God been in the message for 45 years hey fish with the Prophet he walked with a bra mm-hmm if Cosby in you he's gonna respond to his self every time there is no time Christ is gonna say no to his self so what is the Seventh Seal brother wait is she it's Christ and you hidden and simplicity but revealed in the same revealed in simplicity now that you and I were speaking a couple of seconds ago about the voice any man's word is boys is a word why do you think we took why do you think God allowed brother Branham in 1947 musicians come in 1947 brother Brian my first tape he says they're working on some electronic new electronic equipment here remember the first sermon was recorded on a wire and then they were on LP records boy hugs like to carry 1100 of them around well then they had him on the what why am I saying reel-to-reel 7-inch reels when I said if you were here before I don't know if Reda remembers it or not but this whole wall the first church we had this whole wall was nothing but shelves from the top to the bottom with brother Browns messages in in 7-inch reels all up and down where they at now if I had my phone I got him in my phone the whole message it's in my phone if I want to hear the voice all I got ahead is hit the hit the play and and I can hear brother Browns voice I can remember sitting there and and they break they twist the tape record they'll get fast because I remember daddy taking those belts and replacing the belts remember replacing them little rubber belts because that would wear out so much and it's slipping you know it well because he'd be preaching Whitney because you're well you know but you see where we come from what I'm telling you is to see where we've come from now we have all this information so as if God if man has invest that much in technology so has God advanced in the spiritual technology he's given us more and more a day by day more and more than anybody's ever had before and it's all one thing what Christ in you to get you to believe who you already are not who you gonna be who you already are let's table its Christ in you and I'm trying to look up a quote now maybe somebody can help me with it but brother Brian said crossing you the hope of glory the only hope glory has this you cross has already done his work folks Christ does not have to get on the cross again Christ does not have to come back down here in human flesh and die again he did that one time he just wants us to die daily and let Christ live that's the seals the seals is revealing Christ to who and through who you were the recipients of all this and and we like I said before man has made the seventh seal everything but you I believe it's time to debunk all the myths it's not brother branham he's not the seventh seal he's part of it cause he's crying I mean he's got Christ in it but now he's going on so it's got to be the voice of the resurrection to bring those dead Saints out of the ground and it will be the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead will quicken your mortal body and will be changed it's just that's just so simple then you you know you just say really yeah really it's not this all these doctrines that's been started and all these different man's got to raise up and oh we got to follow this guy because let me read this one more time except these days be shortened there should be no flesh save then if any man's are saying to you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show sign great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in desert doesn't that sound familiar don't go out there right here well the Tim hems made a good point the other day he said I'm not born again by relics I'm not I'm born again by Jesus Christ dying on a cross then I give honor to who honors do but I got born again not by relic I didn't get born again by this message I got born again by Christ died on the cross and then absolutely Christ is this message and he took me right straight to it same way with you he took you right straight to it because it's Christ working on both ends we are the seventh seal there is nothing else coming nothing else behind us we are the current revelation you and I are the seventh seal it's what God member what brother Bram's he says is one thing I wondered about all my life what do you wonder about all this life what his job was his job was to bring us to Christ not to a person we've lost that a long time ago let's sing a song god bless you thank you for all your musicians and all your song leaders y'all do a wonderful job yeah amen so let's let's talk to God for a little one 5:56 if that same spirit is that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead well in years well in years if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead well in you but I knew quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwells in years he will quicken your mortal body by a spirit that dwells in you if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead brotherniou telling you if that same spirit there raised Jesus from the dead good news very near [Applause] [Music] but it's me the thrills in years it will quicken your more by the spirit that dwells in you with that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead I knew if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead girly yeah it will break [Music] my head spirit that dwells in years but inside here [Music] by that spirit their reasoning that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead but I knew [Music] your mother by that spirit that dwells in you [Music] the conviction of our sisters enough we need Lord we don't need anything else but just that Lord but give us a confirmation then when this cloth is placed on our brother Lord then it will be done exactly what we said here today Father in Jesus name Amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] by his spirit I will to you [Music] Oh by his spirit that dwells [Music] listen guys all it's gonna take is believing believing what's already been said there's no new doctrine there's no new Bible there's nothing you know we spent 50 and 60 years studying the prophets message I'm glad there's not another prophet coming that we got to study another 50 60 years you know to know something else we got it all we got it all right here I believe that prophet when he spoke that was God speaking to me not you he's speaking to me okay y'all are mm-hmm no he's speaking to me well that's good you believe that you believe he spoke to you you know why cuz you responded to it and responding to it how many times have you shared the message with people and they go no okay that sounds good that's alright and then you never see them again but you might get one out of a million that comes back and says tell me a little bit more about that you know dad down at GM you got all these brothers and all that we're here you know he just starts on Michael Lord you know all of a sudden something responded to something and then you see all the ones that are here so god bless you it's cops doing the work not us but we've yielded ourselves to Christ if when you go home today you're taking Christ home with you when you go to work tomorrow you're taking Christ with when you do your job do your duty and all the different things you do you're doing it for what you're doing it for cross cuz it's costing you the hope of glory it's not Christ and you just don't Sunday and Wednesday I hope not then it's not Christ in you if it's just home Sunday Wednesday but it's Christ in you you are a living walking Messiah you have come to this earth Lord to save the world is that too strong you come to this world because if Christ in you the hope of glory the only way we're gonna get back to glory is through you Adams not here to do it Jesus Christ is not hearing human flesh to do it he's already done it but he's give it to me in you that's the secret he's give it out to me and you he didn't keep it I read that first quote he didn't keep it he gave it out to me and you so there what we can do the works of Christ call this Christ in you the hope of glory let's bow him to Heavenly Father we thank you today for letting us talk about you a little bit more Lord and I pray this week Lord that we will be rejuvenated that be we will
