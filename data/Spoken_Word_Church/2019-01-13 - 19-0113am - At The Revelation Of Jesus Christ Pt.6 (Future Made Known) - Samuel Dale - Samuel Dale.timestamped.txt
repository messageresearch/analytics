[15:24] first Peter one who just read will just
[15:30] go ahead and read verse 13 cuz that's
[15:32] our main point so go ahead roll it up
[15:34] we'll just read verse 13 to pick up our
[15:38] main point from it okay you got it there
[15:43] you go alright and he says we're for
[15:46] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[15:49] and hope to the end for the grace that
[15:52] is to be brought unto you at the
[15:55] revelation of Jesus Christ amen now
[16:00] let's go over into revelations 1 and
[16:04] then we'll start reading in verse 12 and
[16:07] try to pick up our thoughts that we've
[16:09] been dealing on you remember this is the
[16:12] Isle of Patmos and remember the
[16:15] background is that it's the unveiling of
[16:19] the Word of God coming to John that was
[16:22] not we would say previously really
[16:24] written you know and we'll get back to
[16:27] that in a minute it's about the writing
[16:29] of the Bible and things and as it comes
[16:32] forth in the beginning it's letting us
[16:38] know who he is
[16:40] all right now we've covered that we
[16:43] brought over to her point and I thought
[16:45] but then you get over just a little bit
[16:47] in it too about the eighth verse and it
[16:50] stops and it starts dealing with what is
[16:53] John is seeing
[16:55] now the point the main point will be to
[16:58] see you know what takes place the first
[17:03] is too revealing of Jesus Christ me and
[17:05] Almighty God all right then you can see
[17:10] where he goes
[17:11] all right we're going to be dealing with
[17:13] a little word there called in Moorthy
[17:16] which means change in form all right see
[17:20] it doesn't mean change Persinger what
[17:22] change in form it's what you're being
[17:25] revealed at one time and then you change
[17:27] your form so we're going to that thought
[17:29] so okay now let's read verse starting
[17:32] with verse 12
[17:33] you remember John's here too right and
[17:35] what does he do and I turned to see the
[17:37] voice that spake with me and being
[17:39] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[17:42] and in the midst of the seven
[17:44] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[17:46] Man now notice one lakh under the son of
[17:49] man I didn't say the person clothed with
[17:52] the garment down to the foot and Girt
[17:54] about the paps with a golden girdle in
[17:57] his head and his hair were white like
[17:59] wool it's white it's known his eyes were
[18:02] as a flame of fire and his feet like
[18:05] unto fine rice as they were burned in a
[18:08] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[18:10] many waters from Kay listen right there
[18:13] and just go ahead into the service and
[18:16] you may be seated
[18:17] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[18:20] of the word and we've been on this talk
[18:24] for quite a while this is message number
[18:28] five coming forth to talking about the
[18:33] writing of the Bible all right now I've
[18:39] emphasized if we're gonna believe
[18:42] Hebrews 13:8 then Hebrews 13:8 said he's
[18:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[18:51] alright so now then in there can't be
[18:56] anything new or added to or thoughts
[18:59] we're not talking about something like
[19:00] that about writing of the Bible we're
[19:03] talking about when it is actually being
[19:06] written
[19:07] not talking about the point of you know
[19:11] the adding to or anything the book of
[19:14] Revelation is not an audition no and you
[19:18] can't add to the word cut if you add to
[19:20] the word then God will add the plagues
[19:21] right so we don't go that away so we're
[19:24] going to the point of thinking about the
[19:28] writing of the Bible all right and I
[19:31] tried to get a few points to you to
[19:33] think about it that here's Moses writing
[19:36] and he writes the first five books of
[19:39] the Bible and he's actually writing two
[19:44] thousand or maybe almost three thousand
[19:46] years after at the beginning right so
[19:51] he's going from where he's at all the
[19:53] way back 3,000 years telling us what
[19:56] takes place all right now that's how
[19:58] great the writing of the Word of God
[20:00] it's got it'll show the pies but it
[20:03] shows the present and that's what we
[20:06] always miss we missed the present part
[20:08] and then it shows the future all right
[20:12] it's easy to look back see what has been
[20:15] and then it's easy to look forward to
[20:18] try to follow that that is to hopefully
[20:22] come as we think or get our own ideas
[20:24] but it's hard to follow in where we're
[20:27] at right now all right now get the point
[20:31] as I said we're not talking about an
[20:34] addition to the Word of God we're not
[20:36] talking about that we're actually
[20:38] talking about the writing of the word
[20:41] and trying to show how that Moses could
[20:44] tell what happened in Genesis because he
[20:48] was led of God to write all right but
[20:51] then there was a time that he was right
[20:53] there and they said who's to take it out
[20:55] he said I am so now let's get up and go
[20:58] there was a present tense all right but
[21:00] there was a future time to come to where
[21:03] that they would eventually get out of
[21:05] Egypt you know and go to the promised
[21:07] land all right as I said we want to go
[21:09] back dire we want to go over here but we
[21:12] miss the middle part of it
[21:14] so that's you know that is our our doing
[21:18] I want you to think on this little
[21:19] thought will
[21:21] get out as we get through into the
[21:22] message John is writing to the seven
[21:26] churches all right now so he's riding
[21:31] from where he was which was somewhere
[21:34] about 80 95 96 something like that is
[21:37] the writing of John on Patmos all right
[21:40] but he's writing you know and he gives
[21:43] some things that was but then he's
[21:47] dealing with something that's present
[21:49] tense as we get into this about one
[21:52] standing and what he saw
[21:54] all right then the future comes you know
[21:57] that he tells about what is to take
[21:59] place down through the ages all right
[22:03] now I'll get to this thought in a minute
[22:06] cause the Prophet said it like this he
[22:08] said Paul wrote about the life and the
[22:14] times of the ages all right now listen
[22:18] to one saying he didn't write about the
[22:21] church ages he wrote about what was
[22:25] their present that represented because
[22:29] he wrote to the Ephesians the Galatians
[22:33] the Philippians he wrote to you know the
[22:38] churches the Corinthians and and what I
[22:42] like is is Paul writing to the
[22:43] Corinthians he's actually writing to the
[22:45] lady of seon's because that's where
[22:47] we're at
[22:47] all right do you get the point now Paul
[22:50] wrote of what was dire all right and he
[22:57] wrote letters to the churches all over
[23:00] okay all right but John when he comes to
[23:04] Patmos he writes of what has been what
[23:13] is taking place and the future see most
[23:16] of Paul's writing was what was present
[23:18] tense
[23:20] alright but John was writing the Pais
[23:24] the present in the future
[23:25] okay now we can deal as I said with the
[23:29] Pais we can deal with the future but
[23:31] what we need to do is deal with what
[23:34] as we go along in the the seeing the
[23:38] word as it unfolds and as we do then we
[23:42] can see that you know that the Bible is
[23:46] not being handwritten the mower now but
[23:49] it's being made manifest all right now
[23:53] as I said about Moses he saw what was
[23:56] back there he pinned it okay but that
[24:01] wasn't made manifest for some time he
[24:06] all right they were in Egypt they went
[24:09] and they done this and all happened in
[24:11] the Genesis all right we see then they
[24:13] come a time that it was present tense
[24:16] because it was something taking place
[24:20] all right now surely he wrote then of
[24:24] the future all right that's fine because
[24:28] he would write the future of what's
[24:29] coming and to see that then you would
[24:32] would you don't add to the Bible all
[24:35] right
[24:36] the Bible was actually written before
[24:38] the foundation of the world is that true
[24:40] now or I'll see it's not something to be
[24:42] you that can't add to it you can't take
[24:45] away from it so we're not talking about
[24:46] something like that we're talking about
[24:48] seeing a time God would write about
[24:51] something but dienes then it comes a
[24:55] time that God makes that manifest all
[24:59] right so when you're taking it and
[25:01] making it manifest that's your present
[25:03] tense all right and see what I'm trying
[25:07] to get you and I to do is one thing the
[25:09] Prophet preached a message called
[25:11] recognizing your day and it's message in
[25:16] other words recognize where you're at
[25:17] okay
[25:20] see then the Bible is speaking of what
[25:23] you've done today it wrote about it back
[25:28] under what you know what can't we think
[25:34] of it simple you from Alabama you got up
[25:36] an hour earlier you lost time coming
[25:38] across but see you got up you got ready
[25:44] you come to church that's something
[25:47] present
[25:48] tens all right that's the reality and
[25:53] see that's where we live we don't live
[25:56] in the pice because that's our problem
[25:59] there's like driving down the highway
[26:00] looking through the rearview mirror you
[26:02] know see you're gonna wreck up we
[26:05] appreciate the past all right we don't
[26:08] live in the future cuz that's yet to
[26:10] come
[26:11] we believe it will be there because God
[26:14] said it'll be there alright but the
[26:17] thing that I'm trying to get you to see
[26:18] is right now you can talk about the
[26:22] church ages you can talk about you know
[26:24] seeing what it is but seeing present
[26:27] tense a reality of what's taking place
[26:31] that's my whole goal of this little
[26:35] point I told you we'd do a little series
[26:37] part about the church ages and that's my
[26:39] whole goal is to get you and I to not
[26:42] look back or look forward but to look
[26:46] where we are and see where we're at and
[26:49] see what's taking place see if the Bible
[26:53] says that okay
[26:55] we can read it that you know we can go
[26:58] back and I read it when the towers
[27:00] falled and the words gonna come forward
[27:02] well then we seen it follow season that
[27:07] those things you can find a lot of
[27:10] realities but that's what everybody
[27:11] wants to find those type of things they
[27:14] want to find something that's going to
[27:16] take place some way to where they can
[27:20] see them instead of walking day by day
[27:25] because God is not in the future and God
[27:30] is not in the past if he is the I am
[27:35] brother done a real good job together
[27:37] not talking about I am see if he is the
[27:40] I am that spoke to Moses and if he is
[27:44] the I am that when Jesus said before
[27:46] ever had was I am if that's the same I
[27:49] am then why not stay present tense we
[27:56] don't need to look to what a tomorrow is
[27:58] oh that's where people see they'll get
[28:01] when this election comes up and it runs
[28:04] out you know and what another year or
[28:06] two or something anyhow everybody in the
[28:09] message will start here comes a woman to
[28:12] be present in and see warmer never gets
[28:14] to be President
[28:15] we're gonna be in the end uh uh you're
[28:18] deceived you're in the end
[28:21] the woman's already been president
[28:24] woman's been president a long time ago
[28:26] he said no no they ain't will see you're
[28:30] not looking at it like I'm looking at it
[28:31] I'm looking at who runs the show ain't
[28:35] looking to who's doing it I'm looking at
[28:38] the fact that who's doing what's taking
[28:40] place and you look it's it's doing it
[28:43] alright now then to think about seeing
[28:47] something made manifest all right as I
[28:54] said to you about it see the letter the
[28:56] Bible says you know Paul says the letter
[28:58] killeth all right
[29:00] we love it but it'll kill you okay the
[29:04] Prophet said it like this which is what
[29:06] Paul was saying mister letter killeth
[29:08] what did the prophets say about he said
[29:11] long as it lays on the pages of that
[29:12] book he said it can be questioned
[29:16] oh you can't question the Word of God no
[29:21] I know the Word of God is right it's me
[29:24] I'm questioning all right it's my
[29:26] understanding all right but see as long
[29:29] as it's laying on a page you know then
[29:33] it's something to come all right so that
[29:39] won't work because we don't believe in
[29:40] going on into the future part of it all
[29:42] right but see when we can get to the
[29:44] realisation of realizing right where
[29:46] we're at where we're living and the day
[29:50] that we're living the time we're here on
[29:52] earth do you think we can realize
[29:56] realization and say we're here see it
[30:03] you can go back in the Bible and you can
[30:05] read it and see how it does speak toward
[30:08] the future amen
[30:11] there's a lot of things in the Bible
[30:13] that has not taken place
[30:15] all right but there's plenty of it
[30:19] taking place we're gonna be able to
[30:21] believe it okay
[30:23] we sees in that way you can see the Pais
[30:26] the present and the future all right now
[30:30] that was my point and we'll try to get
[30:32] into the thought now the John comes to
[30:36] Patmos he's he's brought there you know
[30:40] actually as a prisoner you would call
[30:42] him uh you know throw it out there
[30:45] because of he's trying to teach the Word
[30:47] of God they tried to boil him and all
[30:49] and that didn't work so they decided
[30:51] they just put him out on that's what we
[30:53] would call a good old modern day
[30:56] Alcatraz and make it to where he's out
[30:59] there you know and snakes and things all
[31:02] he is and there's a leave him out there
[31:03] all right but he's out there the Bible
[31:06] says not because he's a prisoner not
[31:08] because of water you doing anything he
[31:10] was out there for the Word of God God
[31:13] had him out time all right
[31:15] now John is there to get sure the future
[31:23] you know he's - right the future that's
[31:28] the purpose John right - east to the
[31:31] church ages a night right the future
[31:33] that's good that's that's wonderful but
[31:36] I love it seeing that's what I've been
[31:38] trying to bring out about no verse one
[31:40] two and three and then coming on down to
[31:42] verse 8 you know because see it's the
[31:46] revelation that God gives to Jesus to
[31:48] give to John now that's not
[31:51] trinitarianism no that's one true and
[31:54] living God all right
[31:56] see it's the bringing of the word to
[32:00] bring it in to view before us and I like
[32:03] the way the Prophet said it he said when
[32:05] he was he said now John he said I want
[32:07] you to know who I am
[32:09] before we continue any further in other
[32:13] words he wanted him to know who was
[32:14] right who was telling him what to rock
[32:16] okay now you win it then see as he was
[32:21] getting that I want you to know who I am
[32:26] see because if you can't get your
[32:29] Bateman you don't know you if you can't
[32:31] see one true and living God in the Bible
[32:34] seething you don't know who you're
[32:36] talking to or about and that's our
[32:38] problem see we need to get it to the
[32:40] basis of a present tense thought of who
[32:45] he is not who he was
[32:48] that's okay not who he's going to be
[32:51] that's okay but the main thing is to see
[32:55] it what he's doing now
[32:56] all right now has he through the opening
[33:00] of the word that we've been able to read
[33:03] have he revealed himself to you now
[33:10] listen to my wording I know I'm strange
[33:12] in the way I speak things but listen to
[33:14] what I'm saying
[33:14] there is no future listen there's no
[33:18] future revelation he said oh yeah I did
[33:24] this Peter no no because when I get
[33:27] there it won't be no revelation
[33:30] it'll be present tense all right you
[33:33] following me it's present tense when God
[33:36] spoke to Moses right
[33:40] but it went backward 3,000 years see
[33:45] back to Genesis and the starting and
[33:47] then it went forward they another three
[33:52] to bring it to the end of the world you
[33:54] know I'm saying it told of that it told
[33:59] of that but it was not future to him he
[34:03] was writing it down right there it was a
[34:06] reality when a man so chariots just as
[34:11] in the streets he was looking two or
[34:13] three thousand years down the way to
[34:16] worry so cars running up and down the
[34:18] highway and had running light light that
[34:21] had torches and things on the face he
[34:23] saw modern-day American highways right
[34:29] but that didn't put him there see he was
[34:34] here in that spot he was only speaking
[34:37] of it to come that's what we won't we
[34:42] something to tell us the future like I
[34:46] was bring it out the other day you know
[34:47] that they tell the story is just a story
[34:49] but it gets the point that a man got a
[34:51] newspaper a day ahead of everybody else
[34:53] on supply it's a story but to get the
[34:56] point every day he got a newspaper a day
[34:58] ahead of everybody
[34:59] well you know what he could bet on horse
[35:02] racism he could bet on anything he
[35:04] wanted to he'd know who's gonna be
[35:05] President
[35:06] above everybody and all that was well
[35:10] and good till one day turned into the
[35:12] you were and ready died the day
[35:13] before now see that's we said well those
[35:19] are silly it may be able to get the
[35:21] point across see I believe in a living
[35:26] reality of God right now a future God
[35:32] don't misunderstand the wording the
[35:34] future God is no no help to anyone a
[35:39] pice tense God is no help other than
[35:43] helping you to understand it happened to
[35:46] somebody else that was done for somebody
[35:48] all right we see something present tense
[35:52] then that's why he would say I am to
[35:56] Moses I am that I am they need say
[36:03] standing there before Abraham was I am
[36:06] uh-huh did he gets over the book of
[36:09] Revelation that's where we hear and the
[36:11] reading it comes down he said I am
[36:15] alright not future tense not Pais tense
[36:23] think of God like that you praying to
[36:26] God of the future are you praying to a
[36:28] god of the past which one is it or is
[36:38] your God real to you
[36:41] and living in you right now
[36:44] present-tense see then if it is you can
[36:51] see the point the Prophet was making
[36:55] when he said John I want you to know who
[36:58] I am
[36:59] wrote one verse one two and three you
[37:02] know but I want you to know who I am and
[37:06] then we'll continue with things to
[37:09] happen or the future or whatever I said
[37:12] I want you to know who I am
[37:13] and he gets that straight comes from
[37:15] verse six seven eight and nine
[37:17] showing the one true in the Living God
[37:19] who this is talking if you got any
[37:22] Scofield Bible dream though you'll see
[37:24] it's red letter showing that Jesus is
[37:26] standing there see it's the revelation
[37:29] that God gives to Jesus to give to John
[37:32] there were something I won't have time
[37:35] to get to it this at this one but they
[37:37] were something that happens he and dark
[37:43] Jesus was standing here and they asked
[37:45] him when he was coming and he said I
[37:49] don't know do you remember that he said
[37:54] I don't know he said the father hadn't
[37:56] revealed that to me what do you say well
[38:02] he was the father he wrote every time
[38:09] right all right let me ask you a
[38:12] question do you have the Holy Ghost in
[38:15] you do you know everything oh you got
[38:22] trout's retired in you see if you
[38:25] understand the Godhead like that you can
[38:27] follow it and keep everything in a
[38:29] present tense form all right see because
[38:34] he's wanting us to see who he is and
[38:38] then when we get that straight what's
[38:41] the next see that's where is the brother
[38:44] was bringing out the other night since
[38:46] we all know it but you know the word I
[38:48] am it means ever-present alright our
[38:52] present tense
[38:54] you know alright and being I am then
[39:00] there's no way to express that thought
[39:03] in the human language really except for
[39:09] one time you just say he's here is that
[39:15] simple enough could you say he's here
[39:17] we're here we're not living yesterday
[39:21] we're not living tomorrow everybody
[39:24] wants to know future they want to know
[39:25] this right why why not this for them
[39:28] where we're at you call on God sometimes
[39:34] when you need him
[39:35] you're in bad shape are you calling him
[39:37] from the future Taniya are from the PI
[39:39] still now according to the Bible you
[39:41] can't go get him and bring him up that
[39:45] Romans and according about you can't go
[39:48] up and get him and bring him down in
[39:50] other words going to the future and
[39:51] bringing it says the word is nigh thee
[39:54] even in thy mouth it's right here
[40:00] present tense all right John net John
[40:04] you're here now right what you see and
[40:09] send it to the seven churches okay and
[40:15] what does he see he heard a voice right
[40:21] and he turns to see the voice now he
[40:28] knew who's talking to it that's what I'm
[40:31] trying to emphasize the other day see he
[40:33] knew who was talking to it he knew that
[40:35] voice he knew who he was to turn around
[40:38] and see he was not looking for it a
[40:41] father or another person or this that or
[40:44] the other John knew who he was to see do
[40:53] you know him that away when he speaks to
[40:56] you do you know him as a reality of now
[41:06] and he says okay now John I want you to
[41:09] wrap these times and send them to the
[41:11] seven churches Johnson okay
[41:14] what do I write and he hears a voice he
[41:20] had lived with that man for three and a
[41:22] half years right he had walked with a
[41:27] man for three and a half
[41:28] he knew his voice he knew who he was
[41:30] looking for when he was to turn but the
[41:33] surprise was to see that the form that
[41:36] he was in it was not a surprise to see
[41:41] the seven churches because he was to
[41:44] write about the ages right but the
[41:48] surprise was to see who you know where
[41:52] it was that what was taking place all
[41:55] right so he turns to see the voice and
[41:59] he saw seven golden cabinets and he saw
[42:01] one in the midst of the seven golden
[42:03] kind of a lock under the son of man
[42:08] now remember see get your and get your
[42:11] thought in the correct order
[42:13] it's the revelation and God gives to
[42:15] Jesus to give the John so here stands
[42:18] Jesus telling John what to write but
[42:25] when he hears that voice behind him he
[42:29] knows something is taking place so he
[42:32] turned to see the voice and when he did
[42:37] he saw seven golden candlesticks the in
[42:42] he sees one standing in the midst of
[42:44] seven gold chemisty like unto the Son of
[42:46] Man
[42:48] now John knew when he was on earth with
[42:51] this man that all of his life that he
[42:54] journeyed with him Jesus was constantly
[42:57] speaking of the Son of man who the man
[43:00] say out of Sodom an immuno son of man is
[43:02] the son of man so deceits on a mandolin
[43:04] listened but none of them ins are saying
[43:07] today was none of them was able to
[43:09] follow him because Peter said when he
[43:13] said who demand say I the Son of Man and
[43:15] Peter said thou art the Christ the Son
[43:17] of the Living God
[43:20] and what did Jesus say back to him when
[43:23] he was standing there with him on earth
[43:25] he said upon this rock this revelation
[43:27] I'll build my church and the gates of
[43:30] Hell shall not be able to prevail
[43:32] against it all right but he said Peter I
[43:36] asked you who the Son of Man is you
[43:39] answered me that I'm the Christ the Son
[43:42] of the Living God because that was
[43:43] recognizing him to be Almighty God and
[43:46] it's who was standing there but they
[43:49] never understood that son of man they
[43:53] couldn't follow that so here we see him
[43:57] as he goes to the Book of Revelations to
[43:59] write all right now he said I want you
[44:03] to to understand who I am and he tells
[44:06] who he is he was the Christ the Son of
[44:08] the Living God he was the Almighty he's
[44:10] the I am he's not you know he which was
[44:13] he isn't to come he was Jordan John all
[44:15] of that and then he turns to see the
[44:19] voice and he sees the seven golden
[44:22] Catholics and one in the midst of the
[44:23] seven golden chemistry locking the son
[44:25] of man now he knows something
[44:29] John is a prophet remember he's see
[44:33] something that he was not maybe
[44:38] expecting okay that's why we we used the
[44:46] word in morphe which means God changed
[44:50] in form he was back in the Old Testament
[44:53] as Jehovah alright
[44:55] that's finally come down then he turn to
[44:58] Jesus that was not another person that
[45:00] was God in another form he changed his
[45:03] form he had more feed into another form
[45:06] that's where your oneness they make
[45:09] light of us but see that's where your
[45:11] Trinity is God in three persons you know
[45:14] in all of that other all right but then
[45:16] people say well I'm oneness we'll see
[45:19] oneness if you get down and talk to them
[45:23] a while you'll find out that one this is
[45:25] like your finger see Joe over the oh
[45:29] Jesus Holy Ghost
[45:33] because to the oneness doctrine Jesus
[45:36] was the life form of God now that's the
[45:41] oneness doctrine go check with him
[45:43] you'll see that Jesus was the life form
[45:46] of God well I don't agree with that
[45:51] because you see when it did he showed
[45:56] here where he went on the day of
[46:00] Pentecost he changed his form he am
[46:05] morphine he changed his form to be in
[46:08] the body of Christ see that's where you
[46:12] one that's miss it see they stopped that
[46:15] one with the fingers we call it one
[46:17] there's one see you know and they'll
[46:19] just they won't take that there's
[46:21] another form all right
[46:24] see but that's what's the thing Jesus
[46:26] spoke all the way through all the way
[46:31] through his teaching he was speaking of
[46:33] a future to come right showing that he
[46:41] was going to die for our sins all the
[46:45] whole story of the Gospels alright and
[46:48] as he was going to die for our sins and
[46:51] come back he would come back and live in
[46:53] the bride in other words he changed his
[46:57] phone not changing God's he just changed
[47:02] his phone where he was at that time
[47:04] dwelling in one man the flesh we call it
[47:07] Jesus all right see then under there
[47:11] Pentecost he would come back in a mini
[47:13] membered body called the bride what John
[47:17] is shown that that's what's happened
[47:21] that's what took place in the book of
[47:23] Revelation when he turned to see the
[47:25] voice he knew he was there to write
[47:28] about the future and the different
[47:31] things but when he turned to see the
[47:33] voice
[47:35] it's odd readings he turned to see the
[47:38] voice in other words why didn't he say
[47:39] turn to see the person who's talking no
[47:42] he knew is talking
[47:44] right when he heard that voice saying
[47:49] John rot I am the Alpha all of this and
[47:53] he'd wrote before then he knew who that
[47:55] voice was he knew who was talking to him
[48:00] uh-huh but the key was that he he didn't
[48:05] morph it into another form now he's
[48:07] going to show that that took place on
[48:09] the day of Pentecost now are you
[48:12] listening he's going to show what took
[48:15] place under that Pentecost he's gonna
[48:19] show him seven golden candlesticks which
[48:22] would come out of that as I said Paul
[48:24] takes his part he's a prophet he writes
[48:28] to this church he writes to that church
[48:30] he drives to these churches all right
[48:34] but John Paul is writing present tense
[48:39] oh he prophesized and his speaking but
[48:43] he's writing basically present tense
[48:45] trying to get those people to see go
[48:49] back in the book of Hebrews where Paul
[48:51] was writing and getting that Hebrews and
[48:54] look at it how he was trying to explain
[48:56] who Melchizedek was overlock Chapter
[48:59] four I'm in Chapter seven in there where
[49:02] he says this man melts hesitate see Paul
[49:06] was trying to show God getting God to
[49:10] come and show as a reality and then
[49:14] seeing God come from that to chapter
[49:16] right six and seven and eight
[49:18] he's coming and showing I've come up
[49:20] Paul in Hebrew he's coming and showing
[49:24] where he's at and what's taking place
[49:26] he's right there then living in the
[49:28] hearts of man it's Christ in you Paul
[49:31] said the hope of glory
[49:32] all right then when he comes to Patna
[49:36] see to John he shows him where he's at
[49:41] on the day of Pentecost that Holy Ghost
[49:47] came in to the bride of Jesus Christ
[49:50] right that's why there's not a physical
[49:54] you can't have the physical body of the
[49:56] Lord Jesus here
[49:58] right see that's where people's wrong
[50:01] getting it from all in their hands and
[50:03] blood on this and all of that looks like
[50:05] they would have known that if you've got
[50:07] the physical body here you are way
[50:10] advanced in the scriptures because
[50:13] there's no physical body of the Lord
[50:15] Jesus to be on earth until the Millenium
[50:18] all right so then if that's true and we
[50:24] believe it
[50:25] see thing he has to be in another form
[50:28] so he doesn't come and show john in a
[50:32] seven golden candle see and the son of
[50:34] man standing there
[50:38] well he doesn't showing that way that
[50:41] would be the physical they would mess it
[50:45] all up
[50:46] see that's why I said he don't there's
[50:49] no need of the body being here where his
[50:51] body he's got a body the bride of Jesus
[50:56] causes the body of the Lord no see
[51:01] that's President tense that was my whole
[51:04] Florence around a sentiment that's
[51:06] President tense for God to come and live
[51:08] in you it's present tense it's not
[51:10] future and her pies are you trying to
[51:15] pray backward or forward and ain't no
[51:20] need trying to pray up order downward
[51:21] because the Bible tells you not to do
[51:23] all that it tells you to believe who
[51:25] where he's at and speaking out of the
[51:31] heart proceeded all of them come on all
[51:34] right
[51:35] see then you coming to seeing who he's
[51:39] showing him so he says one lock under
[51:43] the son of man thief he said son of man
[51:50] that would have been that form that
[51:51] would have been that in war fee that
[51:53] phone but he didn't say it he said one
[51:55] lock unto the son of man what he's
[51:59] showing then he showed him the bride who
[52:05] was that that was standing in the seven
[52:06] golden candlesticks pull that up brother
[52:09] never heard about
[52:11] brother Joe pull up the one with the
[52:13] drawing that we enter in a pose too to
[52:17] make it look to what we don't they'll
[52:18] get it in a minute of Jesus Christ
[52:20] standing in the seven golden
[52:21] candlesticks or in Bride form right
[52:26] that's what John looks and sees he sees
[52:31] seven golden candlesticks he sees one in
[52:35] the midst of the seven golden
[52:35] counterfeit like unto us on a man that's
[52:38] not the physical son of man
[52:41] that's the amore fee of God to the form
[52:44] that he went to it Pentecost at
[52:48] Pentecost he went to showing the body
[52:53] the bride would be the body of Jesus
[52:56] Christ
[52:57] all right cuz that's who we are
[53:02] we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[53:04] bone those words were the bride all
[53:07] right now so what took place that we
[53:14] read these or we'll go to him in a hurry
[53:16] right around covers the seven churches
[53:17] of message and covers he said one light
[53:21] him who was this his bride one like him
[53:30] who was this his bride one like him she
[53:35] not him in a physical form that's what
[53:39] we're looking for physical things
[53:42] alright this is not the day of the
[53:44] physical even if the rapture took place
[53:49] today according to my Bible and I
[53:51] understand we're supposed to meet him in
[53:53] the air there's no physical coming here
[53:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ he comes we
[54:03] meet him in the air then in the
[54:06] Millenium he comes back and we come back
[54:09] with him into a millennial reign alright
[54:13] so we don't have to worry about the
[54:15] Corporal when the Prophet was saying the
[54:19] bride coming across he said coming out
[54:23] of the church
[54:26] so what happened as we begin to be
[54:29] kicked out of our church tonight walk
[54:33] away you can call that the coming of the
[54:37] Lord because it is because he's in the
[54:39] bride form all right
[54:41] but he said Girt about the paps with a
[54:50] golden girdle did not a man a woman and
[54:56] I said we ain't got the time to go on in
[54:58] to the judge because when he's changing
[55:00] that size and size was changed from down
[55:02] here as a servant it was put up over the
[55:04] shoulder which went on into the to the
[55:07] judge all right well we don't have time
[55:10] to get to that but get what it's all
[55:12] about
[55:12] Girt about the paps not a man a woman
[55:15] with a golden girdle now what happened
[55:18] what is that golden girdle I love this
[55:21] one what is that golden girdle he said
[55:25] well it's a girl just read what he says
[55:29] it's the gospel that held the power and
[55:33] glory of God over the body of Christ
[55:37] there's your golden girdle s that's a
[55:40] whole thing he's showing where God is at
[55:43] he said John I'm going to show you who I
[55:49] am and he showed him who he was the
[55:53] Alpha Omega the beginning it all
[55:55] and he says now John I want you to see
[55:58] what happened and I called it the other
[56:00] day stage two or whatever you want to
[56:03] call it changing him morphe i want you
[56:07] to see where I am more feed out I am
[56:11] more fit into the body across that's why
[56:15] someone standing in the midst of silicon
[56:17] can lock him to the son of man they said
[56:20] what did what did they see brother
[56:22] branham on why we're not a denomination
[56:24] he said I it was the bride standing in
[56:29] the candlesticks Drott out he saw the
[56:34] bride
[56:37] John what did you see I saw the bride
[56:42] and look going into in his presence we
[56:45] read these other day over and over but
[56:48] says when he seen him standing there
[56:50] that glorified state they actually when
[56:58] John's eyes unveiled unto him as he
[57:03] hears the voice and he knows who he's
[57:05] going to see when he turns around that
[57:08] was no surprise but when he turns and he
[57:10] sees the candlesticks and he sees one in
[57:14] the candlestick like in the son of man
[57:16] then it has to unveil them God has to
[57:19] unveil what he's doing
[57:20] said John I want you to say I am now
[57:24] amor fee on the day of Pentecost God
[57:29] changed his form he came into the body
[57:33] of Christ and it was one lakh unto the
[57:39] Son of Man 1 because the Son of Man is
[57:42] the Lord Jesus Christ but when he
[57:44] changed his form he changed it into
[57:47] showing bride form so he says John this
[57:51] is who I am this is what I've done
[57:56] alright look what he goes on he turned
[57:59] to see the voice and when he turned to
[58:02] see the voice the voice and the person
[58:05] are the same all right so it's no
[58:08] surprise as I said I wish you'd go back
[58:12] and listen to that because it really
[58:13] helped me to understand you know you may
[58:17] not father to me right in doing him to
[58:19] repeat it you know that when Paul on the
[58:22] road to Damascus to kill the Christians
[58:24] as he was riding along then and he was
[58:28] struck down to that great blinding huh
[58:29] he said Lord who art thou now this great
[58:36] man that was on his way to kill the
[58:38] Christians to do all the things he was
[58:40] doing it all of that and when a light
[58:42] strikes him down he knows who that is
[58:44] that's what your prophet said said Paul
[58:47] would have never called nothing else
[58:49] Lord he knew that but what did I going
[58:53] to try to express where we can
[58:55] understand see when when that voice
[58:59] spoke back to Paul when Paul said who
[59:04] Lord who art thou he's recognized him
[59:07] Almighty God Jehovah everything you know
[59:12] he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutors
[59:21] well see Paul couldn't recognize his
[59:24] natural voice because he never heard
[59:27] that much in his life he never probably
[59:29] never went to even a meeting or anything
[59:31] that Jesus was in but yet he knew what
[59:34] he was doing he knew right then what was
[59:38] speaking to him was greater than to just
[59:40] see a pillar of fire because he knew he
[59:43] was persecuting the Christians he said
[59:46] I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted click
[59:49] that was Paul said now I understand who
[59:54] this Jesus is no wonder he could be the
[59:58] great one of Jehovah the old with Jesus
[1:00:00] of the new see he could follow him all
[1:00:03] the way through that's why Paul was
[1:00:06] chosen for that not any of the rest of
[1:00:08] them because Paul had all of that
[1:00:10] background Paul had all of the
[1:00:13] background of all of that great study
[1:00:15] training to be there a lawyer or even
[1:00:18] coming to a high priest or something in
[1:00:20] his doings you know and under Gamay or
[1:00:22] the greatest of all the teachers and
[1:00:24] thought he'd done the best he could do
[1:00:26] he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews the
[1:00:29] Pharisee of the Pharisees he said
[1:00:31] concerning the law blameless what about
[1:00:34] a man could say something like that God
[1:00:40] said okay I want to show you because I
[1:00:45] want to slap you down you think you're
[1:00:48] something you're a Pharisee of the
[1:00:49] Pharisees you were their side of the
[1:00:51] other you're doing it I'm gonna just put
[1:00:52] you on your knees for a little while
[1:00:54] said I'm on this the blinds your eyes
[1:00:56] and everything said you're gonna have to
[1:00:59] do this and he said then I'm gonna send
[1:01:01] down
[1:01:03] someone to open your eyes and says when
[1:01:07] I get your eyes open then you're gonna
[1:01:10] find out you're gonna be crawling right
[1:01:13] because that's what he was there for a
[1:01:17] long time Paul was blinded and then you
[1:01:20] know and then when he opened his eyes he
[1:01:23] even stayed partially blinded right but
[1:01:30] yet he knew who's talking to it and see
[1:01:34] John knew his voice he could understand
[1:01:37] he turned to see eggs expecting Paul
[1:01:39] might not have understood his voice but
[1:01:41] he knew that pillar of fire how did he
[1:01:45] know that pillar of fire you don't think
[1:01:47] like that how did Paul know that pillar
[1:01:51] of fire because he was always around
[1:01:53] there he was always his whole life was
[1:01:57] related to serving God he'd been in the
[1:02:04] temple he'd been all over the floor he'd
[1:02:06] eaten worse he done he was great guy but
[1:02:13] he said when I was and he said to him on
[1:02:15] Jesus all said that solves that he said
[1:02:20] I don't understand it he said the best
[1:02:22] thing for me to do I didn't get this on
[1:02:26] my own I got knocked down off my house
[1:02:29] the best thing for me to do is get back
[1:02:31] up on the house and ride somewhere he's
[1:02:35] because they ain't nobody can explain
[1:02:37] this and they wasn't even the great
[1:02:40] apostles couldn't explain to Paul sure
[1:02:42] that for a little bit they were with him
[1:02:44] he was right if you read your scripture
[1:02:46] he was out just a little bit with us
[1:02:48] some of the Apostles maybe but then all
[1:02:50] at once he just goes off he leaves and
[1:02:58] he stays gone one writer says three and
[1:03:01] a half years one of them says 14 either
[1:03:04] one of them is a long time but then when
[1:03:08] he comes back he's preaching the same
[1:03:13] Lord Jesus that Peter was he knew all
[1:03:18] right now he'd got the voice the person
[1:03:22] together and everything that's what I'm
[1:03:23] trying to get have you ever heard his
[1:03:24] voice now quote the Prophet he said have
[1:03:28] you heard in the sealed book let's see
[1:03:30] he said have you heard his voice oh
[1:03:33] brother tell the brother Browns only
[1:03:36] ones of that could speak you can argue
[1:03:40] all you won't think and arguing about it
[1:03:42] I want to tell you God can speak and if
[1:03:47] you doubt he can speak to you you know
[1:03:48] ha
[1:03:49] he he'll speak to you it's okay but if
[1:03:53] you believe in some way somewhere he can
[1:03:54] there's a possibility can maybe you can
[1:03:58] speak to you by the opening of the word
[1:04:00] all right now listen John you're here
[1:04:08] you know now Who I am
[1:04:11] now you know what I've done I've changed
[1:04:14] forms of amore feed on the debt
[1:04:18] Pentecost when you receive that Holy
[1:04:20] Ghost this is what you got the new bark
[1:04:24] John you got eternal life and now I've
[1:04:28] got you here to tell you the future of
[1:04:35] the church because that was John's
[1:04:39] purpose that was the reason he was going
[1:04:42] to Patmos so he's writes him he said
[1:04:46] okay I'm this on that I love coming down
[1:04:47] and then he said okay now John do you
[1:04:49] understand I've changed formed I am more
[1:04:52] feed I'm not on earth anymore I'm not in
[1:04:57] this I'm not in that I'm in the bride so
[1:05:02] I've changed my form and I want you to
[1:05:04] see what form I'm in seven golden
[1:05:07] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[1:05:12] man God in another form of the baptism
[1:05:19] of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:20] into the bride of Jesus Christ what a
[1:05:24] wonderful picture John is shown
[1:05:26] then he goes through and tells him the
[1:05:28] church ages now listen this is the point
[1:05:33] I tried to make about ten years ago when
[1:05:35] I was preaching on this you realize that
[1:05:39] God was setting up John to a place you
[1:05:45] realize that if you'll take the first
[1:05:47] verse 1 through about 13 or 14 you'll
[1:05:54] see this point John wanted the church to
[1:05:59] realize who God was because he was
[1:06:04] living in him Jesus wanted the church to
[1:06:07] see who he was because he was the one
[1:06:10] there to live in each one of us all
[1:06:13] right before he writes the church ages
[1:06:18] now here's the point I've been aiming at
[1:06:21] is for 5 4 sermons as 5 huh
[1:06:25] John I'm gonna tell you what to write to
[1:06:28] the ages I'm gonna tell you there's
[1:06:33] gonna be some bad I'm going on also you
[1:06:38] remember the church age you he's writing
[1:06:40] to the true and falsifying both right
[1:06:42] you remember that he's writing to both
[1:06:44] vines to the church age you he said John
[1:06:46] are not only want you to know all about
[1:06:47] the test but I want you to understand
[1:06:51] John I want you to think about I'm gonna
[1:06:54] show you the future
[1:06:59] did he tell him the future come on
[1:07:03] did he bring him all the way through the
[1:07:05] church edges did he bring him into
[1:07:08] revelations for rapture did he bring him
[1:07:11] in Revelation 5 love in heaven 6 back
[1:07:14] with the Jews run 6 through 19 with the
[1:07:17] Jews really 4 through not three with the
[1:07:20] Jews and then comes back with Jew and
[1:07:23] Gentile are the Jews and the bride in
[1:07:29] chapter 19 riding back into the
[1:07:30] Millenium we get one come by before I
[1:07:36] tell you any of these things to write
[1:07:39] down about the ages
[1:07:40] I want you to know when I get in there
[1:07:45] and say that you got some deeds and
[1:07:49] doctrines now listen to the point I'll
[1:07:52] quit a little bit what was what was the
[1:07:59] reason of Jesus appearing to John to
[1:08:03] write these things before he started
[1:08:05] writing the ages why didn't he just
[1:08:07] write him right to hate you you know cuz
[1:08:11] that's what he was there for but he said
[1:08:13] I want you to know who I am
[1:08:16] till we get to God head straight we got
[1:08:18] all that in line and he said I want you
[1:08:21] to know where I went on the day of
[1:08:25] Pentecost into the bride I changed my
[1:08:29] form and come into the bride and he said
[1:08:38] I'm so much tied up in the bride his
[1:08:43] hair was white like wool etcetera
[1:08:44] etcetera and then John comes down and
[1:08:47] John sees this one in the midst of the
[1:08:51] seven golden candle and listen do you
[1:08:53] believe that was the bride well listen
[1:08:57] to the point when John sees that in the
[1:09:00] sense of glorified condition he falls
[1:09:04] down to worship
[1:09:07] read your Bible come on Ritchie Papa he
[1:09:13] falls down to worship in the end in his
[1:09:17] right hand who this one at the start
[1:09:19] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:09:20] two-edged sword all of those things okay
[1:09:23] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[1:09:25] dead any ladies right hand upon me
[1:09:27] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[1:09:29] and the life that's the Lord Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ that is not a prophet that is not
[1:09:37] anything that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:40] now he unveils that showing one like
[1:09:44] unto the Son of Man would be the bride
[1:09:48] but then when he comes back toward the
[1:09:51] view watch him he's coming by
[1:09:54] to reveal I am all of this
[1:09:58] in other words John I'm gonna right now
[1:10:07] we're gonna rock the church edges now
[1:10:09] won't you write it down don't you write
[1:10:12] these good and don't you write these bad
[1:10:14] things but said remember before we start
[1:10:18] I didn't showed you where I am
[1:10:20] are you listening so there's God to see
[1:10:28] the church ages does he see our wrong
[1:10:31] and he's already told John how perfect
[1:10:34] we are come on you didn't listen to
[1:10:38] where I straighten the Court where the
[1:10:39] Prophet said seeing him standing there
[1:10:41] in her in that glorified condition
[1:10:47] before we start in chapter 2 of the ages
[1:10:53] he already showed how perfect the bride
[1:10:57] is then it goes back into time yeah and
[1:11:05] we do and we have problems we have
[1:11:08] troubles and we're lady offends no no no
[1:11:14] we're not let no we got to be to birthed
[1:11:17] out of that the kamon before he ever
[1:11:21] starts telling anything of the future of
[1:11:25] the church he tells how perfect the
[1:11:27] church is you don't listen you ain't
[1:11:31] listen to what wade talking about the
[1:11:33] fields you and how perfect that shows
[1:11:38] that grace comes on the scene through
[1:11:42] those fields you grace comes on the
[1:11:46] scene who do you think this is standing
[1:11:48] here he's telling you where he went
[1:11:51] John I'm telling you where I'm going I'm
[1:11:53] going in or went because this is after
[1:11:56] pineco he said I went into the bride
[1:12:01] John I want you to see the form of in
[1:12:05] in Brad form one in the midst of selling
[1:12:09] gold Kennison lack under the son of man
[1:12:15] are you listening now what about him
[1:12:20] riding the end of the book before he
[1:12:25] starts the book are you listening
[1:12:30] like I told you my brother he said how
[1:12:33] could Moses cuz see they don't believe
[1:12:35] Moses wrote the first five books they
[1:12:37] think he might wrote four of them or
[1:12:38] whatever it is you know Methodists they
[1:12:40] got all that but he said he said Sam he
[1:12:43] said you can't be right no way about
[1:12:47] Moses writing him thing I said what he
[1:12:50] said called you wrote of his own death I
[1:12:53] said well what's that problem how did he
[1:12:57] write of his own death before he died
[1:13:00] you know what I said you've heard
[1:13:03] already what I said to him and I'm
[1:13:06] talking to a 12-year theologian I said
[1:13:11] look if you'll tell me how Moses knew
[1:13:14] what happened in Genesis and the
[1:13:17] creation and the things that took place
[1:13:19] and the fall of mankind I said then you
[1:13:23] ain't got no problems trying to figure
[1:13:26] out how he could write of his death
[1:13:27] before he died you remember how is
[1:13:30] illustrating the turn today fellas
[1:13:31] listen to the tape about see I could say
[1:13:33] you know what if town life fifty more
[1:13:36] years I'm gonna die
[1:13:37] you know what I'd be doing I'd be
[1:13:39] prophesying right I'd be telling the
[1:13:41] truth go down 78 years old I don't think
[1:13:44] I'd make fifty more years
[1:13:46] well it's easy to write of your own
[1:13:48] death Paul is I mean Moses could write
[1:13:52] or what happened and what happened he
[1:13:55] brought it all the way through to his
[1:13:56] own death and then it kept on going
[1:13:58] because it was the spirit of prophecy
[1:14:02] most okay I won't say it Moses was not
[1:14:07] the guy that wrote the five books
[1:14:10] now Yuri listening don't jump too far
[1:14:14] Rutter he physically pinned or somebody
[1:14:22] did let me talk somebody else all right
[1:14:24] come on anger arguing Moe's has done
[1:14:27] that but the one that was leading him
[1:14:30] the Prophet the Prophet wrote the
[1:14:40] Prophet was one that was speaking
[1:14:42] through Moses now come on we're gonna
[1:14:45] get around a little bit in it you want
[1:14:46] to you remember what the Prophet said
[1:14:51] about Moses he said I couldn't
[1:14:56] understand about Moses being able to
[1:15:01] tell God a better way to do something
[1:15:03] you remember when he come up was gonna
[1:15:06] kill him and Moses said if you kill him
[1:15:09] you're gonna kill me God turns around
[1:15:15] and don't kill him oh yeah he got him
[1:15:17] later
[1:15:17] yeah cuz he said so don't worry about it
[1:15:20] Moses he said I'm gonna bypass it now
[1:15:22] I'm gonna pass over you leave it because
[1:15:26] you're doing that but he said I'll deal
[1:15:29] with him but what to probably say about
[1:15:32] Moses he said I couldn't see how Moses
[1:15:35] could tell God I better wait till I've
[1:15:37] seen it was Christ in Moses there's the
[1:15:42] Prophet the Prophet is the Lord Jesus
[1:15:46] Christ little Brandon was not the
[1:15:51] prophet he was a prophet the Prophet is
[1:15:55] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:56] all right here is the Prophet himself
[1:16:01] appearing to John on Patmos and telling
[1:16:05] him what's taking place any back so said
[1:16:12] okay now we'll sit down here we'll write
[1:16:13] down what we're going right we said I
[1:16:15] want you to know forever start writing I
[1:16:20] want you to know for
[1:16:21] start writing I want you to know what
[1:16:26] I'm gonna do before I start writing for
[1:16:27] start telling you the good and the bad
[1:16:30] so I won't tell you what you who you are
[1:16:35] you think he's in the midst of the seven
[1:16:37] golden candlesticks do you think that
[1:16:39] bride is going to be wiped off the earth
[1:16:40] for some reason or wrong or something
[1:16:44] and he shows where he's at you
[1:16:46] understand what I'm getting at
[1:16:47] he shows right where he went he went
[1:16:50] right into the Bride of Christ on the
[1:16:52] death penticoff who can lay anything to
[1:16:55] the charge of God's elect when God has
[1:16:59] already wrote the future about it
[1:17:04] the commodious wrote the book to two
[1:17:08] lady ousia up to the what in the third
[1:17:12] Church age I mean third chapter he's
[1:17:16] already wrote chapter 4 showing
[1:17:20] 24 elders sometime he's already wrote
[1:17:24] that's what he's doing here John write
[1:17:27] these things do you follow me he's
[1:17:33] already told you how perfect you are all
[1:17:37] you gotta do is accept back come on
[1:17:45] did the Prophet say this he said you can
[1:17:47] accept him all you want to was said but
[1:17:49] he's got to accept you but do you
[1:17:53] realize what I'm saying if he's already
[1:17:56] wrote the back of the book he's done
[1:18:00] told how he accepts you the book of
[1:18:04] Revelation doesn't show some outlandish
[1:18:06] brighter or four it shows how perfect
[1:18:09] that bride really is come on
[1:18:18] what about it taking a reduced feeling
[1:18:24] animal quit
[1:18:30] okay if they won't pick up number uh
[1:18:32] pick up number five if you want to we'll
[1:18:36] start on number five which is revelation
[1:18:39] of Jesus Christ
[1:18:40] all right no it is not the story of John
[1:18:43] but is the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:18:46] the future church ages
[1:18:51] he's riding of what's going to take
[1:18:54] place in the future Church ages in verse
[1:18:57] three it's called a prophecy and that's
[1:18:59] exactly what it is go ahead number the
[1:19:02] revelation of Jesus Christ look what he
[1:19:06] says rayona the letters to the seven
[1:19:09] churches were written prophetically ever
[1:19:12] how you pronounce that word to the
[1:19:14] future ages now here's the one I told
[1:19:17] you was in our life Paul wrote of the
[1:19:19] life and glory of the seven church
[1:19:21] churches present in his day now not
[1:19:26] seven Church agency hero to the churches
[1:19:29] in his day some of them were the age
[1:19:31] some of them were names that went on
[1:19:33] over but that that's not it Paul wrote
[1:19:36] of the glory of the seven churches
[1:19:38] present in his day John wrote of the
[1:19:41] life and glory of the seven church
[1:19:43] churches in the future that John was
[1:19:48] addressing the seven pastors or
[1:19:50] messengers of the ages see Paul wrote of
[1:19:53] what's taking place John wrote of the
[1:19:55] future okay come on let's go over the
[1:19:58] next one page thirteen church age book
[1:20:00] this book is usually termed a revelation
[1:20:03] of st. John but that is incorrect
[1:20:05] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:20:07] given to John for Christians of all ages
[1:20:09] it is the only book in the entire Bible
[1:20:12] that is written by Jesus himself through
[1:20:16] personally appearing to a scribe come on
[1:20:20] he's dying today it is the last book of
[1:20:25] the Bible yet it tells the beginning and
[1:20:27] the ending and all things drop all down
[1:20:28] cuz we're gonna pick up one more flower
[1:20:30] now the unveil I'm covering is not only
[1:20:34] the revelation of the person of Christ
[1:20:39] now listen you'll get the whole message
[1:20:41] from this
[1:20:42] but it is the revelation of his future
[1:20:45] works in the oncoming 7 church ages now
[1:20:50] he's going to write the future but glory
[1:20:55] listen he told you the present he told
[1:21:00] you his pies to where he come from
[1:21:02] he told you the present and how perfect
[1:21:05] you are then he's gonna tell what's
[1:21:09] gonna take place he's just gonna ride it
[1:21:11] out in other words listen the fees in
[1:21:16] church age there's the first chapter of
[1:21:21] Revelations which is the only book in
[1:21:22] the Bible in the New Testament the whole
[1:21:25] Canon of the New Testament is the only
[1:21:28] book in other words the book of
[1:21:30] Revelation is the only book that Jesus
[1:21:34] puts his own sea alone he comes to John
[1:21:41] on Patmos to write the book right come
[1:21:46] on let's get this one morning real quick
[1:21:52] revelations Jesus Christ and this book
[1:21:55] is not the uncovering of so much the
[1:21:58] person of Jesus Christ yet it certainly
[1:22:01] speaks of his deity and his Sevenfold
[1:22:03] personal eats and also of the things
[1:22:05] that he is like priest-king and so forth
[1:22:08] but it is the revealing of the future of
[1:22:11] his works in his 7 church ages that's
[1:22:15] coming on i read that but is the
[1:22:20] revealing of the future of his works in
[1:22:23] his seven church ages are coming master
[1:22:27] so they asked him see when the Lord was
[1:22:30] here on earth disciple asked him said
[1:22:32] master will you at this time restore the
[1:22:35] kingdom back to Israel member book of
[1:22:38] Acts and Jesus said it's not for you to
[1:22:40] know this hour or time and no one would
[1:22:44] know said even the Sun as yet now listen
[1:22:47] even the Sun as yet do you not know you
[1:22:53] remember the story while ago don't get
[1:22:55] flopped up
[1:22:56] own it and mess up you mind remember I
[1:22:59] asked you the question you say well why
[1:23:02] wouldn't he's a father why didn't he
[1:23:03] know you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:06] Ghost
[1:23:06] why don't you know everything because
[1:23:10] you haven't had it revealed to you are
[1:23:12] made manifest Jesus was a human element
[1:23:16] and that human element did not know
[1:23:21] everything now watch it though because
[1:23:25] when this takes place this human element
[1:23:30] of Jesus has already went to the
[1:23:34] crucifixion
[1:23:35] he's already went to the transformation
[1:23:39] he's already went to the resurrection
[1:23:41] he's already went through these things
[1:23:43] right this man named Jesus no what's it
[1:23:52] no one knows that even the son is yet
[1:23:55] did not know but after his death burial
[1:24:00] and resurrection and ascension into
[1:24:03] glory okay come on he received from God
[1:24:07] the future of the church in other words
[1:24:12] he got the revelation of what he's going
[1:24:14] to do what he was going to do and where
[1:24:17] he was going he was going into the
[1:24:19] church he was going to be there he was
[1:24:22] going to be through the ages know what
[1:24:23] then he returned back to bring his
[1:24:25] message to the church and this message
[1:24:28] of his coming and the condition of his
[1:24:30] churches down through the age he could
[1:24:34] not do it before his death Brookland
[1:24:36] resurrection because he had not yet knew
[1:24:39] it but did you notice how the scripture
[1:24:41] brings it okay the unveiling
[1:24:45] come on musicians the unveiling listen

[1:24:52] to just talk about Church ages I hope
[1:24:55] you're listening cause remember this one
[1:25:02] in the sense of the seven golden
[1:25:03] candlesticks was the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:25:30] world is in lady Elsie well you know
[1:25:33] what that means that means six church
[1:25:34] ages are done pies huh let's see we're
[1:25:42] standing here in the seventh church age
[1:25:44] lady of SIA giving the revelation of not
[1:25:48] what is to happen because that's that's
[1:25:51] not our point I don't care about what
[1:25:54] tomorrow is going to be I try to live
[1:25:56] every day day by day I try to walk day
[1:25:59] by day in the Lord because tomorrow
[1:26:04] tomorrow's wonderful but remember
[1:26:09] tomorrow is a future I want to live with
[1:26:12] the I am I want to stay where exactly we
[1:26:17] don't think he's into Martin no not if
[1:26:19] he's right now if he said it I ain't
[1:26:20] gonna argue with him about it are you he
[1:26:24] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:26:26] you I'll be with you now I like it - it
[1:26:29] said it didn't say always come on read
[1:26:34] your Bible he said I'll be with you
[1:26:36] alway they know ass on the end of it
[1:26:39] because alway means simply if you look
[1:26:43] it up and find what he's talking about
[1:26:44] there he said I'm going to be with you
[1:26:46] when I need to be with you as well I
[1:26:52] thought he was with me all the time he
[1:26:54] is you just don't know it you just don't
[1:26:58] know it
[1:26:58] he wants you to know when he's with you
[1:27:01] because he's never going to leave you
[1:27:03] right come on listen he showed the
[1:27:08] church perfect before he ever start
[1:27:10] telling the ages is that the summation
[1:27:17] or our thought or idea of the entire
[1:27:19] Bible
[1:27:23] you realize that in genesis before he
[1:27:27] got down to doing anything he'd already
[1:27:30] put the seed of the woman which was
[1:27:37] Jesus Christ right
[1:27:40] how can he condemned anything when man
[1:27:45] sinned in the garden now listen you
[1:27:49] realize how perfect Moses could drive
[1:27:51] when man sinned in the garden
[1:27:54] do you realize God Himself came down and
[1:28:00] killed him animals itself and made skins
[1:28:04] oh no no yeah well now you tell me who
[1:28:07] else did then we will wind on argue
[1:28:10] about it we just gonna make facts the
[1:28:13] animals got killed and if he was the
[1:28:15] only one there he must have been the one
[1:28:17] that killed him oh I don't believe God
[1:28:20] can kill that's not I like what rabbi
[1:28:23] Richmond said about offering a sacrifice
[1:28:25] he said when that sacrifice is offering
[1:28:27] he said it simply means God is right
[1:28:32] there every one of them offerings of
[1:28:36] them lamb since I meant God was standing
[1:28:38] right there but we don't see it that way
[1:28:44] we see him all will be under overtire
[1:28:46] that's our problem
[1:28:47] let's get him here if we get him here
[1:28:51] then he can reveal his word like on
[1:28:55] these things less than what we got past
