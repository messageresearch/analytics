[0:00] absolutely
[0:04] i love that lighthouse
[1:06] as we study these scriptures lord that
[1:07] our minds will be set toward your word
[1:09] lord that we will be ready to receive
[1:11] this morning when our brother comes
[1:12] forth to minister lord and we just ask
[1:14] lord that you'll be with him as he
[1:15] studies lord and
[1:17] lord that you'll just fill at liberty to
[1:18] move among us this morning lord and this
[1:20] afternoon granted lord that you'll bless
[1:21] the reading of your word now in your
[1:24] name so hebrews 6 uh and and just you
[1:28] know just to kind of set the context
[1:30] this is the scripture that
[1:32] god pointed brother branham to when he
[1:34] saw those those two men that were
[1:36] in in the meeting that one was one was
[1:39] genuine and one was one was fake and but
[1:42] they both had the genuine anointing of
[1:43] the holy ghost and moving and
[1:45] and speaking in tongues and and
[1:48] rejoicing and worshiping in the spirit
[1:49] and those kind of things
[1:51] so it says in verse four for it is
[1:53] impossible for those who were once
[1:54] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:56] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:57] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[1:59] word of god and the world and the powers
[2:01] of the world to come
[2:03] if they shall follow a way to renew them
[2:05] again under repentance seeing they
[2:07] crucified themselves the son of god
[2:08] afresh and put him to an open shame
[2:11] for the earth which drinketh into the
[2:13] rain that cometh off the opponent and
[2:15] bringeth forth herbs and meat for them
[2:17] by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[2:19] from god
[2:20] but that which bear thorns and briars is
[2:23] rejected and is not into cursing whose
[2:25] end is to be burned
[2:26] you know really if you want to just
[2:28] meditate on the sense of this scripture
[2:29] that paul is talking about you know
[2:31] there's a lot of people that rejoice and
[2:32] that are partakers of the holy ghost
[2:35] but if you turn away from the word then
[2:37] it's not going to profit you anything
[2:41] if you reject the word
[2:42] and uh and crucify to themselves the son
[2:45] of god afresh which you know that when
[2:47] they put jesus on the cross they
[2:49] they did so because they were rejecting
[2:51] his word and they they didn't just turn
[2:53] away from it but they
[2:54] they they they struck out at it
[2:57] and you know that when the rain falls
[2:59] upon the earth it's actually
[3:01] it's gonna bring to life whatever is in
[3:04] the earth
[3:05] and so we were reading that parable and
[3:07] we'll get to it again uh of that jesus
[3:10] said that jesus told of the parable of
[3:12] the sower and that this the seed was
[3:14] sewn into the ground and and that
[3:16] parable the good uh
[3:19] it's talking about the the the word
[3:21] being sown into into people
[3:24] well let's
[3:25] let's uh
[3:26] let's just meditate on some of the
[3:27] things that brother brahms said about
[3:29] about this scripture both partook of the
[3:31] same nourishment water and sun both
[3:33] prayed both received help from god for
[3:36] he maketh his son and reigned to fall on
[3:38] both good and evil and though they both
[3:40] had the same wonderful blessing and both
[3:42] had the same wonderful manifestations
[3:43] there was still that one great
[3:45] difference
[3:46] they were of different seed
[3:48] and so there's that parable in matthew
[3:50] chapter 13 that jesus began to talk
[3:52] about he that received the seed into the
[3:54] good ground
[3:55] as he that heareth the word and
[3:57] understandeth it
[3:58] so the good ground here is some his
[4:00] people is a is a church uh that that can
[4:03] receive
[4:04] the word for your day
[4:06] and bear for fruit
[4:08] which also bears fruit and bringeth
[4:10] forth some 100 fold some 60 some some
[4:13] 30.
[4:14] now maybe just just meditate and think
[4:16] think now you know we you
[4:19] you want to uh
[4:21] our goal really is to understand what's
[4:23] what's the difference between a genuine
[4:25] and a fake believer
[4:27] so that we can have confidence that
[4:28] we're genuine that were that were true
[4:31] how do i know that god is tabernacled in
[4:33] my heart how do i know that he's that
[4:35] he's in there that he's dwelling there
[4:37] and you know if if
[4:39] any any man was sitting in a house or
[4:41] anybody uh you know there's an evidence
[4:43] that you leave behind there's an
[4:45] evidence that you know if
[4:47] if a deer goes through the woods it
[4:48] leaves behind a trail that you can
[4:50] follow broken branches and and sounds
[4:53] and
[4:55] the little white tail that you can see
[4:56] runs through the bushes and things and
[4:58] and and you can see in evidence
[5:00] and evidence that that god is in you if
[5:02] he's there there's there's an evidence
[5:04] that you can look at
[5:06] so the evidence now
[5:08] we'll examine let's just meditate on
[5:10] that as we go through this scripture and
[5:11] i notice
[5:13] the parable that jesus taught i know
[5:15] it's it's a little bit hard to read
[5:17] but i've got a picture up there jesus
[5:18] teaching so if you can't read it let's
[5:20] just do like
[5:22] they did when they were listening to
[5:23] jesus and just listen
[5:26] and jesus said
[5:28] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[5:29] sower
[5:30] when anyone heareth the word of the
[5:32] kingdom and understandeth it not then
[5:34] cometh the wicked one and catch it the
[5:35] way that which was sown in the heart
[5:37] this is he which received seed by the
[5:39] wayside
[5:40] now see this this is jesus explaining a
[5:42] parable of how to know how to know if if
[5:45] god is in you or not if there's
[5:47] what he's talking about is the different
[5:49] kind of people
[5:50] different kind of people that hear the
[5:51] word and react to it differently and
[5:54] really the sum of it is
[5:55] when you hear the word do you hang on to
[5:57] it long enough for god actually to come
[5:59] and quicken it to you to you or do you
[6:01] just let somebody the devil come by and
[6:03] snatch it away or let the trials of life
[6:05] or something something take it away from
[6:07] you
[6:08] when when when somebody tells you you
[6:10] know that all things are possible to
[6:11] them to believe you hang on to that
[6:14] when somebody tells you that the promise
[6:16] there's a promise of the new birth do
[6:18] you hang on to that or do you just let
[6:20] somebody come by and take it away well i
[6:23] don't know that the devil i i don't know
[6:25] if that's for me
[6:27] if there's there's a promise for healing
[6:29] and you you hang on to that and then god
[6:32] will bring it to pass so in verse 19
[6:35] when anyone hears the word of the
[6:36] kingdom and understandeth it not
[6:39] there's a lot of things we don't
[6:40] understand right right away when we hear
[6:42] it you you hear so many things that are
[6:44] see seem puzzling and everything but if
[6:46] you just hang on to it then god will
[6:49] the spirit will quicken it and put
[6:52] things together put it together and make
[6:54] it plain
[6:57] but he that receiveth the seed into
[6:58] stony places the same as he that heareth
[7:00] the word and a nun with joy receives it
[7:03] first
[7:04] they start off real good start off
[7:06] running like you see people come to
[7:07] church and they they're so excited at
[7:09] first but but after a while they start
[7:12] stop coming and then you don't hear
[7:13] about them anymore i mean you just just
[7:15] think about all the
[7:16] all the ones back in your life that that
[7:19] you saw hit the ground running at first
[7:21] and then after a while that where are
[7:23] they
[7:23] and that's what jesus is talking about
[7:25] here he had hath he not rooted himself
[7:27] but dureth for a while for when
[7:29] tribulation or persecution arises
[7:31] because of the word
[7:33] by and by
[7:34] he's offended
[7:36] and that's that's what that jesus said
[7:38] the forgotten beatitude is blessed are
[7:40] those that are not offended in me
[7:42] because when you start becoming a
[7:43] christian there's many things that that
[7:45] it's
[7:46] people say things about you do things
[7:48] about you like i was preaching that
[7:50] wednesday night about the people that
[7:51] then we went with my kayak and somebody
[7:53] wrote on the back of my van because they
[7:55] saw that that picture of jesus on the
[7:57] back of our van there's a lot of things
[7:59] that that are offensive
[8:01] why'd they do that
[8:03] but that's not gonna i want the word i
[8:05] want the seals to be opened up i want to
[8:07] understand what this message about is
[8:09] about and when you're rooting
[8:11] if you're like jesus said if yet he hath
[8:13] he not rooted himself if you're rooted
[8:15] you're going to hang on because you want
[8:16] to see the word manifested
[8:20] he also that receives seed among the
[8:22] thorns is he that heareth the word and
[8:24] the care of this world and the
[8:25] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[8:28] and he become unfruitful
[8:29] now you can see that just just looking
[8:31] around that's that's what happens to a
[8:33] lot of people they get so concerned
[8:34] about money and more concerned about the
[8:36] world and more concerned about being
[8:38] able to watch movies and stuff than they
[8:40] are about the world and all that care of
[8:42] the world will choke it out well i i
[8:45] gotta go to my job instead of coming to
[8:47] church i gotta i gotta do this or that i
[8:49] gotta uh
[8:50] do all these side activities but if
[8:53] you're concerned the main thing
[8:55] the most important thing if the most
[8:57] important thing is the new birth and
[8:59] that means the most important thing is
[9:00] the word and if the word is foremost in
[9:03] your life
[9:04] then you won't do like this scripture is
[9:06] talking about that you just let
[9:08] everything in the world choke out the
[9:10] word until you just you just you just
[9:12] don't care about it anymore
[9:14] but he that receives seed into the good
[9:16] ground
[9:17] the good ground now that's a believer
[9:18] that will grab ahold of the word
[9:21] and say i'm going to believe this
[9:23] somebody maybe that like like brother
[9:25] brown gave the illustration that uh
[9:27] people have been making fun of you and
[9:29] and you kind of got low god will bring
[9:30] you down into a valley where you start
[9:32] to get desperate and something's got to
[9:34] happen and and i you you get tired of
[9:36] the situation that you're in
[9:38] that's some good tilled up ground that's
[9:41] ready to receive the word you're ready
[9:43] to do whatever it takes if it's go out
[9:45] into the mud pit um or and and stay
[9:48] there all night or like like that story
[9:50] that brother around told with the
[9:51] brother i'm willing to stay in the in
[9:53] the mud all night if that's what it
[9:54] takes
[9:56] because that's some good ground you
[9:57] don't have to all you got to do is
[9:58] believe
[9:59] but good ground is when you're at a spot
[10:02] where you're ready to believe but he
[10:04] that receives seed into the good ground
[10:05] is he that heareth the word
[10:07] and understandeth it which also beareth
[10:10] fruit now look at those evidences you
[10:12] hear the word
[10:13] and you understand
[10:15] but it doesn't stop there
[10:17] bears fruit
[10:18] so you got to put all those things
[10:19] together
[10:21] faith is going to produce it's going to
[10:23] produce fruit it's going to produce a
[10:25] changed life so hear and understand
[10:29] and bear fruit
[10:30] and bring it forth
[10:32] 700 fold some 60
[10:35] some 30
[10:36] because it depends
[10:38] on what your capacity is how much word
[10:40] you can receive what day and hour you're
[10:42] living in that's why in this hour
[10:45] we've got a surely we've got to bear
[10:46] more forth more fruit than the other
[10:49] ages did because we've got more word
[10:52] we're we've got to bear forth the fruit
[10:54] of the doctrine of this the coming of
[10:56] the son of man
[10:58] so
[11:03] let's think about he that heareth the
[11:04] word
[11:05] when you're when you're seeking the new
[11:07] birth you're you're
[11:09] the
[11:09] you begin to hear all these strange
[11:11] these maybe strange things and like on
[11:14] the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2
[11:16] when peter began to what
[11:18] what was sown in their heart the word
[11:20] was sown in their heart and then the
[11:22] spirit came and quickened it what was
[11:23] sown christ was sown so what was peter
[11:26] preaching on the day of pentecost he was
[11:28] preaching christ and he preached he laid
[11:30] out for them who he was and why he
[11:31] fulfilled the old testament and he laid
[11:33] it out
[11:34] and he said and then their hearts were
[11:36] pricked and and they asked him well what
[11:38] do we need to do and he said repent and
[11:39] be baptized every one of you in the name
[11:41] of jesus christ
[11:42] for the remission of sins and you shall
[11:44] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[11:46] the promises unto you so you know you
[11:49] that's a word that's sown into your
[11:50] heart and you hang on to it and you
[11:52] begin to meditate on that that god
[11:54] promised that to me that god sent that
[11:56] to me and there's a promise to me
[11:58] there's a promise
[12:00] as many as are far off to your children
[12:03] and so parents hang on to that word and
[12:05] you're hanging on to that as a promise
[12:08] and and in matthew chapter 3 verse 9
[12:10] think not to say within yourselves we
[12:11] have abraham to our father for i say
[12:13] unto you this is a scripture that i hung
[12:15] on to when i was thinking of the new
[12:16] birth that god is able of these stones
[12:18] to raise up children under abraham and i
[12:20] hang hung onto that because people will
[12:22] tell you well it's it's not for you and
[12:25] you know lay all kinds of reasons in
[12:26] front of you and all kinds of doubts and
[12:28] stuff but you you you look to the word
[12:31] instead of your own opinions
[12:33] your own ideas and you begin to hang on
[12:35] to that
[12:36] that's the seed that god that has to be
[12:38] sown into your heart that you hang on to
[12:41] and don't let the thorns and the cares
[12:43] of life and money problems and all of
[12:45] that stuff get in the way of it you're
[12:47] hanging on to the word of god
[12:49] you hang on to isaiah where it says
[12:51] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[12:52] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[12:55] him stricken submitting of god and
[12:57] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[12:59] transgressions that means he was wounded
[13:01] for my transgressions
[13:03] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[13:05] last time we kind of examined what
[13:07] iniquity is to know
[13:08] what you need to do and you won't do it
[13:11] so he was bruised when for my iniquities
[13:13] when i knew
[13:14] what to do and yet i went away from and
[13:16] didn't do that thing whatever it was all
[13:19] those iniquities piled up he paid the
[13:21] price for that and see all these things
[13:23] that are sown in your heart and you
[13:25] begin to hang on to that until god makes
[13:27] it real
[13:29] you see why the new birth is not just
[13:31] feeling something
[13:32] but it's actually something being
[13:34] quickened the word that you hold in your
[13:36] heart is quicken until it's made real to
[13:38] you
[13:39] and then you got an evidence that
[13:41] nothing can take away the devil can't
[13:43] take away the people at work can't take
[13:45] away people maybe in your family there
[13:47] well i don't think it's possible i don't
[13:49] think it's real but you know it's real
[13:51] because there was something sown in your
[13:53] heart that you hung on to and till
[13:55] christ
[13:56] made it manifest
[13:59] you can see the word can always be
[14:01] questioned when it's on the page
[14:03] but when christ makes it alive it can't
[14:05] be questioned anymore
[14:08] you hang on to it and you're questioning
[14:10] it maybe
[14:11] but when christ makes it alive it's not
[14:13] questioned anymore
[14:15] so let galatians 2 20 really lays down
[14:17] what what the new birth is where paul
[14:20] said i am crucified with christ
[14:22] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[14:24] liveth in me
[14:26] there's somebody there
[14:28] there's somebody in my heart that's
[14:29] changed my thinking that's changed
[14:31] that's positioned me so that so that i
[14:34] can hear the word and believe it which
[14:36] is what paul is saying here in the next
[14:38] part of this verse the life which i now
[14:40] live in the flesh i'm in the flesh
[14:43] but i'm living
[14:45] by the faith of the son of god
[14:47] so that means that it ain't my faith
[14:49] anymore
[14:50] that christ's faith is corrupt when you
[14:53] get the new birth he's he's in there now
[14:56] and the evidence of that is that he can
[14:58] believe
[14:59] he's believing the word he wants the
[15:01] word that's that's why he's
[15:04] if christ is in you he's going to take
[15:06] you somewhere where you can get the word
[15:07] because there's a hunger in you i got to
[15:09] get the word
[15:11] you know even look back in your life
[15:13] where you thought maybe at first you
[15:15] know you really enjoyed the song service
[15:17] and you really enjoyed feeling good in
[15:18] church but then there came a place where
[15:20] you're like i got to get the word i want
[15:23] to know what this message is about i
[15:25] want to know what this gospel is about
[15:27] and something begins to work in your
[15:28] life and the word begins to open up
[15:30] that's christ in you to reveal the word
[15:33] and what see what when the word is being
[15:35] sown in you it's christ being sown
[15:39] christ be the word is christ and what's
[15:41] being revealed in you is christ
[15:44] so the new evidence of the new birth is
[15:46] a revelation of christ a revelation to
[15:49] you personally
[15:51] of jesus christ where you can see jesus
[15:54] christ
[15:56] that's what all of these things behind
[15:57] us on the wall that we refer to so many
[15:59] times are that this is jesus christ
[16:02] this is a
[16:04] the building the tabernacle of the
[16:05] living god as jesus christ the stature
[16:08] of a perfect man that he's built up and
[16:10] that's why paul said the life which i
[16:12] now live in the flesh i live by the
[16:14] faith
[16:15] of the son of god so through
[16:17] justification and sanctification you're
[16:19] believing but when he gives you the new
[16:21] birth christ comes in and he believes
[16:25] and you don't understand everything at
[16:26] the new birth but your position then
[16:29] because god is there
[16:30] to believe
[16:34] god is there on the inside
[16:35] to believe
[16:37] and when you bring in the word he'll
[16:38] open it up to you
[16:42] so brother rahm would say in matthew
[16:43] chapter 7 or this is jesus again in
[16:45] matthew chapter 7
[16:48] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[16:50] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[16:51] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[16:53] father which is in heaven and we know
[16:55] that the will of the father is his word
[16:57] so here's the evidence the evidence that
[16:59] you're on the right track that god is
[17:02] there is that you're doing the will like
[17:04] and i gave the example earlier that uh
[17:06] you know somebody would say you know
[17:07] when they're sick they were somebody
[17:10] asked us to pray for them they were sick
[17:11] and they they said don't pray for god's
[17:13] will pray for or pray for me don't pray
[17:15] for me to get well pray for god's will
[17:18] but now
[17:19] we just read that he was wounded for our
[17:21] transgressions bruised for our
[17:22] iniquities
[17:25] for our uh you know he died for our
[17:27] healing and all those you got all those
[17:29] promises and psalms for getting out the
[17:30] benefits so you look in the bible and
[17:32] you see
[17:34] his will is for you to be healed
[17:36] so
[17:37] that's what that's what i'm talking
[17:38] about is that if you know the word and
[17:40] the word is quickened to you then you
[17:42] know what he wants done with the word
[17:44] and he like in this example his his will
[17:48] is for you to be healed his will is for
[17:50] you to be saved his will is for you to
[17:52] be filled with the holy ghost his will
[17:54] is for you to be a christian that walks
[17:57] in the fullness of the word that's not
[17:58] tossed about by every every dot every
[18:01] wind of doctrine that's not blown around
[18:03] that can walk straight straight down
[18:05] that line of the word
[18:07] so jesus would say many will say to me
[18:09] in that day lord have we not prophesied
[18:11] in our name that sounds good doesn't it
[18:14] there's a lot of things you can do in
[18:16] church that
[18:17] just as you know
[18:20] under the influence of the holy spirit
[18:22] in church just being around other
[18:24] believers and
[18:25] listening to the songs that are song and
[18:27] things and in that name have cast out
[18:29] devils because judas casted out devils
[18:31] and in thy name done many wonderful
[18:33] works
[18:34] all of that's great
[18:36] but what about the word
[18:38] because the revelation of jesus christ
[18:40] personally to you as an evidence that
[18:42] god is in your soul
[18:44] that god has positioned you to receive
[18:46] his word
[18:48] he'll say then i'll profess unto them i
[18:50] never knew you
[18:52] i never i never had a relationship with
[18:54] you
[18:55] i never knew you
[18:56] like
[18:57] like in the natural like adam uh
[19:00] eventually knew his wife
[19:02] hey he never he never knew you he never
[19:05] he never uh quickened his word to you
[19:09] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[19:11] therefore whosoever heareth these
[19:13] sayings of mine and doeth them
[19:15] i will liken him unto a wise man which
[19:17] built his house upon a rock and see
[19:20] there's that evidence again whoso here
[19:22] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[19:25] if you can hear the word
[19:27] and then it goes into action
[19:30] heareth these sayings of mine and do
[19:31] with them i will liken him unto him a
[19:34] wise man
[19:35] which built his house upon a rock and
[19:38] the whole church is built upon the rock
[19:41] of the revelation of jesus christ
[19:45] so brother ramen with pergamy in church
[19:47] ages said and there it is
[19:49] you can't claim that manifestation is
[19:51] the evidence of being spirit-born
[19:52] spirit-filled no sir
[19:54] that means you can't claim that just
[19:56] because you ran up down the aisle or
[19:58] when they go to camp meeting and felt
[19:59] felt something up and down your back or
[20:01] whatever that your spirit feel
[20:04] i will admit that true manifestation is
[20:06] the evidence of the holy spirit doing
[20:08] mighty acts
[20:09] but it is not the evidence of the
[20:11] individual being spirit-filled even
[20:13] though that individual has an abundance
[20:14] of those manifestations
[20:16] judas
[20:18] balaam
[20:20] cain
[20:21] all these examples down through
[20:22] scripture
[20:23] of people going to church and looked
[20:26] like they were
[20:27] doing right
[20:28] but the evidence of receiving the holy
[20:30] ghost today is just the same as it was
[20:32] back in the day of our lord
[20:35] it is receiving the word of truth for
[20:37] the day in which you live now think
[20:39] about what he's saying there the
[20:40] evidence that somebody's there in your
[20:42] house
[20:43] the evidence
[20:44] like a deer running through the woods i
[20:46] know the deer was here because i can see
[20:47] branches is broken i can see the trail
[20:49] that he left the evidence that a man was
[20:51] in your house somebody he left
[20:53] footprints outside i can see his
[20:54] footprints the evidence of the holy
[20:57] ghost is that you receive the word for
[20:59] the day that you're living in
[21:01] so the evidence is you come to church
[21:03] and when the word starts to be preached
[21:05] you're like i want some more of that
[21:07] that's that's my
[21:08] foremost thing above everything else
[21:11] you you see
[21:12] if you're following the word if you're
[21:14] making decisions in life for the word
[21:17] you're on the right track right if you
[21:19] if that is your foremost thing
[21:21] in front of everything else in front of
[21:23] all the things in life that you want the
[21:26] word that shows that there's somebody
[21:28] somebody that's guiding you
[21:30] jesus never did stress the importance of
[21:32] the works as he did the word he knew
[21:34] that if the people got the word
[21:36] the works would follow
[21:39] because if you put the works before the
[21:41] word then you're putting the cart before
[21:42] the horse but if you put the word for it
[21:45] first that's the thing that will produce
[21:47] the works
[21:54] so down on the inside
[21:56] and i'll get like just a few more
[21:58] minutes
[22:00] see my little diagram here down on the
[22:01] inside your soul can be as black as soot
[22:04] and
[22:05] i got a little the little serpent there
[22:07] but in your spirit and your body you can
[22:09] feel you can feel things you can be
[22:10] influenced by the holy genuine anointing
[22:12] of the holy ghost and if you want to
[22:14] study that out more go to the sermon
[22:15] anointed ones at the end time
[22:18] go to the god of this evil age
[22:21] satan's eden
[22:23] and read those things and study that out
[22:25] but in luke chapter 13 he said then said
[22:27] one unto him lord
[22:29] are there few that be saved
[22:32] and he said unto them
[22:33] strive to enter into the straight gate
[22:35] for many i say unto you will seek to
[22:36] enter in and shall not be able there's
[22:40] many people that come to church and and
[22:42] like the example i gave last time so
[22:45] swinging incense won't save you
[22:47] and confess until you're a catholic
[22:49] priest won't save you there's a lot of
[22:51] things you go to church listening to the
[22:53] brooklyn tabernacle choir won't save you
[22:55] there's a lot of churchy things that we
[22:57] do
[22:58] but the word is what saves you
[23:00] just because you're in church and doing
[23:02] churchy things doesn't save you the word
[23:05] is what saves you
[23:06] when once the master of the house has
[23:08] risen up and has shut to the door and
[23:10] you begin to stand without and to knock
[23:11] at the door saying lord lord open unto
[23:13] us
[23:15] and he shall answer it and say unto you
[23:16] i know you not which you are
[23:19] then shall you begin to say we have
[23:20] eaten and drunk in thy presence we we
[23:22] were in church and we we fellowshipped
[23:25] under the anointing the genuine
[23:26] anointing of the holy ghost and thou
[23:27] hast taught in our streets you were you
[23:30] are in our church
[23:31] but he shall say i tell you i know you
[23:33] not once you are depart from me all you
[23:36] workers of iniquity
[23:38] and iniquity is when you know
[23:40] something you actually know is right and
[23:42] you won't do it
[23:44] and you know one of the biggest things
[23:45] that really the umbrella example of
[23:47] iniquity is you know that you need to be
[23:50] born again and if you won't do it that's
[23:53] the master example of iniquity if you
[23:55] know that you need to be baptized and
[23:57] won't go be baptized if you know
[24:00] all of these things that you know you
[24:01] need to do
[24:02] that that there's something wrong but
[24:04] when god comes in and sets himself in
[24:07] your heart he'll drive out the iniquity
[24:09] from your from your soul and you'll
[24:12] begin to be
[24:13] aligned correctly to to receive the word
[24:16] the musicians can go ahead and come
[24:18] forward
[24:20] brother emma said some what is iniquity
[24:22] is something that you know that's right
[24:24] and you can see it and won't do it in
[24:25] your heart
[24:26] when you know that that bible teaches a
[24:29] certain thing
[24:30] and you won't do it that's iniquity
[24:33] as that seems a little bit deep and
[24:35] everything i i you you start talking
[24:37] about iniquity but see these things are
[24:39] laying a framework
[24:40] of a foundation
[24:42] so that one day
[24:44] when when you start listening to the
[24:46] seven seals
[24:47] then everything begins to get put
[24:49] together and you see what brother
[24:50] random's talking about when in that
[24:52] first seal he starts talking about
[24:54] iniquity and when it's got to be driven
[24:56] out
[24:57] and those kind of things
[24:59] everything's everything's a
[25:01] a building blocks that build up into the
[25:03] final culmination of rapture and faith
[25:05] to get us out of here and we'll just end
[25:07] right there god bless you
[25:09] [Applause]
[25:19] oh
