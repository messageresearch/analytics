[0:00] eleven wherefore seeing we also are
[0:02] compassed because I think we stopped
[0:04] right down there where I got a little
[0:07] marker wherefore seeing we also are
[0:09] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[0:11] witnesses left side every weight and the
[0:13] sin which does so easy to the seventh
[0:15] let us run with patience the race that
[0:18] is set before us and remember this race
[0:21] is not a this race is not a microwave
[0:24] race not an int no it's it's kind of
[0:28] like a crock pot you turn it on low and
[0:30] you wait two three days or a day for
[0:32] your food ready that's the same way
[0:34] because as we were talking even last
[0:36] Sunday you see these people falling away
[0:40] and and and all that is just as the
[0:44] Bible says those who endure to the end
[0:45] shall be saved so and then you look at
[0:49] their Bible know in the book of Matthew
[0:51] and you see that the the seed that Jesus
[0:54] planted the children of the kingdom did
[0:57] we forget about that the children of the
[0:59] kingdom his her lies and then you throw
[1:04] the seeds out and then it went by the
[1:05] wayside and it grew up and got so high
[1:08] and then one didn't get in the water
[1:10] didn't get the ribs what is good Ruth
[1:12] the teaching good good I was thinking
[1:16] the other day you know we were talking
[1:17] about and I was talking about it about
[1:19] the town's about do's and don'ts and we
[1:21] all have do we all have to go through
[1:22] the do's and don'ts so then it becomes a
[1:23] love affair with God to where you want
[1:27] to go to church you want to fellowship
[1:28] with brothers you want to read your
[1:30] Bible I mean if somebody has to tell you
[1:32] to press play if somebody's got to tell
[1:34] you to read your Bible somebody's got to
[1:35] tell you to study then you know III
[1:37] doubt your experience because that's
[1:39] what we're built on right now to do it
[1:43] all the time listen we all gotta live
[1:45] our lives but we can take that little
[1:47] bit of time too
[1:52] let us last out every weight and the sin
[1:55] which doth so easily beset us so we
[1:57] still have to as babies and Christ we
[2:00] still have to do things but I like what
[2:05] somebody said one time you know God
[2:07] doesn't need our money but the Bible is
[2:11] full of copy that's not for God he can
[2:17] make all the gold he can make this whole
[2:19] place one big ball of gold so he doesn't
[2:22] need your money said well I got a time
[2:24] because no you tithe because it makes it
[2:27] cheerful giver that's what the Bible did
[2:28] and you learn to give because that's
[2:31] what a Christian experience is it's
[2:33] giving it's giving it well and the money
[2:35] that we give and the time that we give
[2:37] it goes toward the kingdom of God but
[2:40] it's not that the kingdom of God is
[2:41] going to collapse if you quit paying
[2:42] your time no no he doesn't need your
[2:46] money but he needs you to be a cheerful
[2:48] Giver he needs you to be able to learn
[2:50] how to give the same way about church
[2:52] it's not so much the building but you
[2:55] need to learn to come together into into
[2:57] you know bind yourself together with the
[3:01] children of God have some fellowship
[3:03] where the children died it's like dad
[3:06] and brother Dean in the amount of
[3:09] Colorado couldn't find the church that
[3:10] Sunday to go to there was Colorado in
[3:12] that part there wasn't a message church
[3:13] to go do so they just went to a cafe and
[3:16] sat down had their own little Bible
[3:18] study right there again we'll see that's
[3:19] fellowshipping together that's bringing
[3:21] in fellowship you wanting to do the
[3:26] things you've done you wanting to come
[3:28] to church wanting to do these things I
[3:30] make this a treasure e to you then you
[3:32] don't have the new birth you just do not
[3:34] have the new birth the business
[3:35] directory to come and visit your your
[3:39] family members but you got revel
[3:44] patients you just got to keep coming so
[3:46] why is this going so long you know why
[3:47] it's going so long because of me and you
[3:52] need to say the same thing because it
[3:53] mean say me well then you're not talking
[3:55] about me come with you
[3:57] so every one of us have that we have to
[4:00] deal with things but
[4:03] like I was thinking the other day we
[4:04] were what we were preaching on us there
[4:07] but the you come to the baby form we
[4:10] were talking my faith you come before
[4:12] brother they'll come with that faith in
[4:14] the bottom of the pyramid when you come
[4:16] to that justification because I'm going
[4:18] to get to this insane when you start on
[4:20] your journey my brother tells them faith
[4:22] that's not an ad right no thanks not a
[4:26] mad
[4:26] it says they had to your faith your
[4:28] faith when you and God come together as
[4:32] one at the new birth it becomes your
[4:34] faith programs that this is mind I gave
[4:36] it to me so it becomes your faith add to
[4:40] your faith then you got seven that's
[4:42] right but now you can stop anywhere you
[4:46] want to you have that still godlike
[4:50] quality or that ability to stop anywhere
[4:53] you want to but the Bible says those who
[4:56] he's justified these already glorified
[4:58] so appearance if you're justified today
[5:00] that's what we were talking about Tim's
[5:02] going through the three stages we've
[5:03] just we can't even thank kids that
[5:05] didn't know them and you'll hear it if
[5:06] you get them if you get the tape
[5:09] but baby form justification you're not
[5:11] thinking about glorification when you
[5:15] come to the altar the first time you got
[5:17] saved not born again state when you come
[5:19] to the altar confess your sin and God is
[5:22] just to forgive you right you're not
[5:27] thinking about the headstone you're not
[5:29] thinking about seals and you're not
[5:31] thinking you're just glad that God has
[5:34] took them past sins away from your crown
[5:36] right and that's not happiness you're
[5:39] not you don't say oh now though I'm
[5:41] justified I've already glorified I'm
[5:42] gonna do anything no you can't think
[5:44] that way you're a human being you gotta
[5:46] thank God you just forgive me of my sins
[5:49] and now I'm I'm working toward getting
[5:52] morning in that's the problem with
[5:54] people that's why I stand here looking
[5:56] to Jesus the author and finisher of our
[5:58] faith if he starts it he's gonna finish
[6:01] it but a lot of times we give my brother
[6:03] man 7 to even a good work of
[6:05] sanctification man we think we religious
[6:08] or we start doing the things of God and
[6:10] go to church yes just think
[6:12] - you have to be really really careful
[6:14] that when you come to the baptism of the
[6:16] Holy Ghost and God starts teaching new
[6:18] things that's what we were talking about
[6:20] it brother Tim though I did it all
[6:21] through the Bible I read but about three
[6:23] quotes in Brooklyn but all through the
[6:25] Bible you look you'd say yeah those who
[6:28] they justify these very glorified ins
[6:29] the the key I want you to see is is you
[6:33] got to run this race with patience now
[6:35] when you get justified brother Tim made
[6:38] oh good come in afterwards because you
[6:42] know you can say that so much - you can
[6:44] just go into greasy grace
[6:46] well I'm justified I don't matter if I'm
[6:49] like I was a child molester I can still
[6:50] go back to doing what I was doing I'm
[6:52] okay I'm gonna make it real I have
[6:54] because that's what he knew a guy in the
[6:56] message that was a song leader that used
[6:59] that in court he went to natural court
[7:05] and told the judge he said God has
[7:08] watched me from that vile thing I did
[7:12] and I'm not guilty
[7:15] because whether I'm says the real you
[7:17] didn't do it well now that guy needed a
[7:21] berth because he didn't run with
[7:24] patience he what he done was is Satan
[7:26] entered in and told him everything was
[7:28] fine now I know listen you tell you go
[7:31] you got to believe one thing for sure
[7:33] you got to be that's a real fine line
[7:35] because remember there's a there's a
[7:37] brother that brother branham was
[7:39] associated with Pat caller that Tyler
[7:41] was a gunslinger he was the killer he
[7:43] killed people before he came to them to
[7:46] the message before he Kevin got born
[7:48] again well you know what he's not a
[7:50] killer anymore but you know what he
[7:51] didn't do he didn't use it as a crutch
[7:53] he didn't go to natural court and saying
[7:56] I didn't do that the real me didn't do
[7:59] it well you know what if you talk like
[8:02] that
[8:02] the other real you did do it but you do
[8:04] have to come to a place to where you say
[8:06] that if you have things in your life
[8:08] because once the difference in a child
[8:09] molester and somebody to smoke and drink
[8:11] what's the difference since then Rahab
[8:15] the harlot
[8:16] she was a harlot
[8:19] until their accusers got done away live
[8:21] but you got to remember one thing's for
[8:22] sure you gotta make sure you keep that
[8:25] in your mind that yeah that oh you
[8:27] didn't do that you're truly born again
[8:29] and God will never hold that against you
[8:31] but you better be careful because what
[8:33] you did you did in the body and there's
[8:36] still that middle memory reason constant
[8:38] specks of imagination that still
[8:40] motivates you to the green so what I'm
[8:43] saying is to be careful that's just not
[8:44] walk around and say well the real me
[8:46] didn't do it anyway I'm you know I
[8:48] didn't you know I did this you be
[8:51] careful until the blood of Jesus Christ
[8:53] will cleanse everything butBut
[8:55] blaspheming the Holy Ghost okay so we
[8:57] got to look at that if that man would
[8:59] have approached it right the child
[9:01] molester would approached it right he'd
[9:03] be okay because you can't hold that it
[9:05] gun truly justified it then he'll never
[9:08] have to give an account for that but you
[9:10] can't bring it in and justify the whole
[9:12] thing's what I was trying to get the
[9:13] people to see was is the Bible says to
[9:15] just and the justifier is the same now
[9:20] if God justifies you you're justified
[9:24] but the problem is we put some me in
[9:27] there I try to justify the things that I
[9:31] did or do or whatever right if you'll
[9:34] just leave it on Christ because looking
[9:36] to Jesus the author and finisher of our
[9:39] faith in other words he started then you
[9:42] give that paid to us with our faith and
[9:44] then he guides us up this pyramid to
[9:47] this capstone which is divine love or
[9:50] excuse me
[9:52] the love of God now really you get the
[9:54] love of God down here if you're born
[9:55] again you have a love of God yourself
[9:57] right
[9:58] you're just as borning in and you'll
[9:59] never be born again your Bride of Christ
[10:01] you're going into rapture if you pass
[10:04] away you're going to be in the
[10:05] resurrection you're going to take a body
[10:07] chain because those who is justified
[10:09] he's already won all right but let's not
[10:12] use that as a crutch to say well you
[10:15] know I don't have to worry about my past
[10:17] me you don't have to worry about your
[10:18] past but quit bringing it up but using
[10:21] that as a crutch right be careful with
[10:24] that
[10:25] we still have a spirit realm that is in
[10:28] this world motivated by this world
[10:31] memory reason conscious effect if those
[10:33] five things right alone your
[10:35] refrigerator they don't bother you pray
[10:36] for Miko they bother me my memory of the
[10:40] things I'm done I can't erase that
[10:43] my reasoning against the Word of God my
[10:48] imagination
[10:49] good grief think imagination and God
[10:51] whatever we think Salinger write
[10:54] whatever he thinks is still happening
[10:56] all right but not with us and our our
[11:00] affection is not it's not that affection
[11:03] right
[11:04] it's billy-oh love all right and then
[11:08] with memory and reason conscious man you
[11:11] conscious is what killed me being
[11:14] conscious of things you'd be conscious
[11:15] of what's going on being conscious so
[11:17] those five things but you don't have to
[11:19] look God's already cleaned the inside
[11:21] got up if you're born again he's trying
[11:25] to work his way out this way
[11:26] say he's trying to get back into his
[11:28] house cuz we read the book of read there
[11:30] and Luke where it says the unclean
[11:31] spirit goes out of a man walking driving
[11:34] places c4s pilots none comes back in
[11:36] here says my house same said I'll come
[11:39] back to my house you have to be careful
[11:42] you let him back in then the state at
[11:45] 7:00 time work that's what those who
[11:49] endure everything yes no it's not gate
[11:51] well no no party time but looking unto
[11:57] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[11:59] faith and do your faith your faith who
[12:03] for the joy that was set before him
[12:05] endured there's the word endured the
[12:07] cross despising the shame and is set
[12:09] down at the right hand of the throne of
[12:11] God for consider him that endured such
[12:14] contradiction of sinners against himself
[12:16] lest you be wearing and pain in your
[12:18] mind let me tell you a little something
[12:21] had a brother
[12:25] we were talking about something the
[12:27] other day and he was at a certain church
[12:31] and I hate it when I just can't I can't
[12:36] see the wisdom and people that somebody
[12:38] it's like we were talking about a while
[12:41] ago about you know the woman comes into
[12:43] church there was Cindy I mind if I use
[12:47] you several years ago she any come
[12:48] walking in short hair and pants on okay
[12:51] did we say anything about that
[12:53] no I'm sure dining them did but we
[12:56] didn't I
[12:58] you could you let that you don't just
[13:00] set there and blast the person we've
[13:03] seen that happen I don't think that's
[13:05] God right I don't think that's God did
[13:07] this you know in the preacher told me
[13:09] one time he said I had to he said I had
[13:11] to hit that the woman said right in
[13:12] front of joy her first service you come
[13:14] in from penticoff first service came in
[13:16] sat down front and that preacher pretty
[13:18] everybody could have left he was
[13:20] preaching on her and you know what that
[13:23] probably bruised her in in afterwards
[13:25] that's what he told me he said though I
[13:26] had to hit that you know she walked in
[13:28] the door with that and I just looked and
[13:29] shook my head let go let me but so this
[13:36] brother who lived to the southern
[13:38] brother's church and he preached know
[13:40] we've had enough teaching now we need a
[13:42] demonstration I just don't know where
[13:44] these people get this that the problem
[13:45] is he had enough teaching to say what he
[13:48] did yeah and the person who came from he
[13:51] needed some teaching but what he was
[13:52] doing was he was telling this brother
[13:55] that reason you're not preaching today
[13:57] is because we don't need any of that
[13:59] anymore now buddy that's kind of
[14:01] narrow-minded right there we don't need
[14:03] any of that we need a demonstration I
[14:05] don't know what they think about
[14:06] demonstration there look at the healings
[14:09] and the power of God there's one on in
[14:10] this church they want it to happen every
[14:12] day well you know what they're wanting
[14:13] their long brother Browns I know I need
[14:16] to come back before they have a prayer
[14:18] line ever service and everybody's healed
[14:19] and everybody that's gone folks that's
[14:22] gone it's gone that was a one man
[14:24] message as far as that was concerned hey
[14:27] man you're already making a mess yes
[14:30] we're trying to get in my works you're
[14:32] right
[14:32] I told y'all I told y'all 20 years ago
[14:35] Satan's gonna put a man in this message
[14:37] with signs and wonders and they ain't
[14:39] gonna care what he preaches they're
[14:41] going to go in that's what everything's
[14:42] turning to now signs and wonders and all
[14:45] this person you ought to go through
[14:47] their prayer line and that's okay if you
[14:50] need it but man I'm gonna stand on two
[14:52] feet you know my brother Claude said
[14:57] this is really good I think brother
[14:59] Claude Sidney you receive your healing
[15:01] setting in the seat God gets all the
[15:06] glory if you walk up to the front of the
[15:10] church and brother Dale I don't care me
[15:12] or Donny regular whoever lays hands on
[15:14] you what you're gonna say is I got
[15:16] healed because do you know what you're
[15:19] doing you give him 50% of the glory to
[15:21] that man and 50% to God and that don't
[15:24] work right see that's why God said when
[15:27] he was here on earth he said I found no
[15:29] greater faith when that all the Gentiles
[15:31] said hey you just speak to her right
[15:33] before don't touch me you don't have to
[15:37] touch me you don't have to go in my
[15:40] house but then you got Jarius and all
[15:43] them oh come to my house a little put
[15:44] your hands you know and I told him many
[15:50] times before Jesus never screamed at her
[15:53] Damon and brother Graham never screams
[15:55] and Haman there's no way to scream at
[15:58] her name and now you might get him to
[15:59] leave for a little while he's just gonna
[16:03] come right back you know why because
[16:05] brother Brown said even that maniac that
[16:08] he fell at his feet somebody asked him
[16:11] said did he was he deliver that brother
[16:13] I said no it just came right back off
[16:15] the guy let on that demon okay so but I
[16:18] just don't know I want to understand
[16:20] that that power without character of
[16:23] satanic everybody's want the power power
[16:25] power power power God's not going to
[16:27] give us the power to the label
[16:28] manhandling right because look at Peter
[16:31] and Paul man I mean they just looked it
[16:36] I mean they call just Paul and Peter
[16:38] said look on us
[16:41] no hands lay down
[16:44] only for the holy up and Paul rebuked
[16:47] type of girl and rebuked the demon in
[16:50] the girl you know every time I see a
[16:53] demon in the Bible they're screaming in
[16:55] Jesus so they're screaming that the
[16:56] person there the person is not screaming
[16:58] the damn yeah brother branham during the
[17:00] prayer line commas of cucumber never
[17:02] scream didn't have to because you know
[17:04] what that's supreme power in control
[17:09] that's correct
[17:10] he never screamed I don't know why these
[17:12] people happen I'm sorry you know why
[17:14] because it's this you're stoking this
[17:18] right here and it's only temporary and
[17:20] yes I guess they haven't paid for a
[17:22] coupon it's only temporarily but we got
[17:25] Endor to the end for consider him who
[17:29] Jesus Christ my whole point was when
[17:33] Jesus was healing the people he was very
[17:36] popular but when he that's what I've
[17:39] told this brother
[17:40] I said look to me that's a compliment I
[17:44] hate it for the brothers that said it
[17:45] behind the pulpit but the brother step
[17:47] now I said look they hated Jesus when he
[17:50] started preaching doctrine when he
[17:53] started teaching they hated him and they
[17:55] cut him off who did their religious
[17:58] people of the day well who's the
[17:59] religious people today not bad this
[18:00] methods been ago right
[18:03] they say that but it is and so you're
[18:07] going to be hated because you're trying
[18:12] to teach the people the message instead
[18:15] of some emotion looking unto Jesus the
[18:19] author and finisher of our faith who for
[18:21] the joy that was set before him endured
[18:22] the cross despising the shame and is set
[18:25] down at the right hand of the throne of
[18:26] God for consider him that endured such
[18:29] contradiction of sinners against him
[18:32] lest you be wearing and fainting your
[18:34] mind so what you're saying is you're
[18:36] going to have there's going to be
[18:37] contradiction in your life but remember
[18:40] you
[18:40] must endure you have not yet resisted
[18:45] unto blood striving against sin so
[18:47] what's he saying you had been hung
[18:49] lacrosse you haven't been you know
[18:53] nobody has went through what Jesus went
[18:55] through nobody I mean even Peter they
[19:00] hung him upside down but they didn't
[19:01] stick a spear in his side and beat him
[19:03] with a can of nine-tailed pull his beard
[19:05] Outland with their hands all right so
[19:07] Jesus endured all that for us so we
[19:09] don't have to do that we don't have to
[19:11] get on the cross we bear our cross
[19:13] different you don't want you to get a
[19:16] boat across he will shoot a bear that
[19:17] cross all right
[19:18] but consider him that endured this
[19:20] contradiction of sinners against himself
[19:21] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[19:24] minds you have not yet resisted unto
[19:26] blood striving against sin and you have
[19:28] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[19:30] unto you having two children my son
[19:32] despise not thou the chastening
[19:35] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[19:38] thou art rebuked of him in other words
[19:39] Paul what he's saying we're gonna go
[19:42] through chastisement we're gonna go do a
[19:44] little rebuke from the Lord loveth he
[19:48] chasing it and scourges every son whom
[19:53] he receiveth I was thinking the other
[19:56] day we've had two deaths that were a one
[20:01] with great tragic brother Joel Reynolds
[20:04] daughter was killed in a car wreck 16
[20:05] years old you know I was thinking I said
[20:08] Lord we do question but we don't as
[20:12] Christians you cannot question what God
[20:15] has done you can
[20:19] you cannot and then brother 10:1 hours
[20:22] talking then it's true see God knows
[20:26] what would have happened to that poor
[20:27] that girl if if her life would have
[20:29] continued on who knows only he knows and
[20:34] then brad johnson 62 years old brother
[20:37] Davey Johnson's oldest brother died of a
[20:40] heart attack you know it some of the
[20:41] things you know but as Christians we
[20:43] must not cannot question God we can't he
[20:52] knows best he's got it all under control
[20:54] he knows what's gonna happen tomorrow
[20:56] right all right sure in our humanity we
[21:00] do we always do I'm sure brother Joel
[21:01] Reynolds we do was just devastated but
[21:04] being a Christian that's where your
[21:06] anchor he's got to hold in and say hey
[21:08] God you know what's best for the whole
[21:10] plan right and and I believe she they
[21:14] said she was a believer if you know that
[21:16] she was living good Christian life so
[21:18] he'll see you don't worry you'll see
[21:21] your loved ones don't worry about them
[21:22] it's the separation of one hurts us it's
[21:26] the separation of family and and seeing
[21:29] them alive memory raising conscious
[21:32] affection imagination that what killed
[21:33] us right you have not resisted on blood
[21:36] you have forgotten the exhortation which
[21:38] speaketh unto you have two children my
[21:40] son despise not thou the chastening of
[21:42] the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[21:44] of him for them the Lord loveth he
[21:46] chasing it and scourges every son whom
[21:48] he receiveth if you endure then they
[21:51] were again endure chastening God dealeth
[21:53] with you as with sons for what son is he
[21:58] whom the father chasing the not but if
[22:01] ye be without chastisement work for all
[22:04] our protector of all our protectors then
[22:06] your masters and not sons boy you don't
[22:08] want to be called that furthermore we
[22:11] have had fathers of our flesh was
[22:12] corrected us and given we give them
[22:14] rivers weed with
[22:15] let's get him down to here follow peace
[22:18] with all men and holiness without which
[22:20] no man shall see the Lord you see that
[22:23] follow a peace with all men and holiness
[22:26] without which no man shall see the Lord
[22:33] looking diligently the lest any man fail
[22:36] of the grace of the kind lest any root
[22:38] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[22:41] and therefore many be defiled lest there
[22:44] be any fornicator or profane person as
[22:46] Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his
[22:50] birthright pray do you know how that
[22:52] afterwards when he heaven went he would
[22:55] have inherited the blessing remember he
[22:57] was the firstborn he would have
[22:58] inherited the blessing he was rejected
[23:01] for he found no place of repentance
[23:04] though he sought it carefully with tears
[23:08] well ye are not coming to the mount that
[23:10] might be touched and that burned with
[23:12] fire nor into blackness and darkness and
[23:14] Tempest me he goes over back to the
[23:16] children of Israel in the wilderness
[23:18] journey and the sound of a trumpet and
[23:21] the voice of the words which voice they
[23:23] that heard entreated that the words
[23:26] should not be spoken to them anymore
[23:27] when to say this because in Moses we
[23:30] don't want God to speak to us any more
[23:31] you go let him talk to you you come down
[23:33] here and the Bible says they said we'll
[23:35] do whatever you say they like they did
[23:37] not do whatever they said right here
[23:43] he's interpolating you duck you print
[23:45] the signal okay he never played for they
[23:47] could not endure that which was
[23:49] commanded and if so much as the beast
[23:52] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[23:55] thrust through with the dark and so
[23:57] terrible was the sight that Moses said I
[23:59] exceedingly fear and quake but ye are
[24:03] coming to Mount Zion brother Brown said
[24:06] there'd be a mountains on now Carmel
[24:09] Mount Transfiguration all those show
[24:11] them but you have coming to Mount Zion
[24:13] and to the city of the Living God the
[24:15] heavenly
[24:16] not one owner and to an innumerable
[24:19] company of angels I mean something oh I
[24:25] guess Mia Bella close were talking the
[24:26] other day about if you could just look
[24:28] another dimension that what's going on
[24:30] all the things that's going on with that
[24:32] man this is that which is our little son
[24:33] of the universe there's nothing else
[24:34] going on no there's millions and
[24:37] billions of angels renting this place
[24:38] for God keeping you you got it every
[24:43] person gonna die ever believers got an
[24:45] angel a personal angel right right
[24:47] children have a you got angels that
[24:49] deliver this and deliver that you got
[24:50] all these different Gabriel you got
[24:52] Michael they're real they're not fake
[24:55] they're real angels and they're in a
[24:58] faster dimension but they're helping us
[25:00] read your Bible you go read your Bible
[25:02] but it even says right here into an
[25:05] innumerable company of angels
[25:09] so as remember when the lodge in Gaza
[25:14] Lysa could see into another dimension he
[25:16] saw he saw nothing but angels and he
[25:20] said please open guys's eyes Lord just
[25:23] for a minute late and see what's going
[25:24] on and he did and there was one when
[25:28] Elijah said there's more for us than
[25:29] they are against us and there was only
[25:31] two people standing there he saw
[25:33] something that gangs didn't see but as
[25:36] it when he could look in that other
[25:38] dimension by God allowed him to look in
[25:40] the other dimension what he did took the
[25:42] fairway so I think today we need to let
[25:44] take the fear away of anything that's
[25:46] going on let's don't be foolish but
[25:50] let's remember that God's got this whole
[25:53] thing in control I say foolish by means
[25:54] I'm a son of God I'm gonna go stand out
[25:57] in the middle that road and there's
[25:59] nothing gonna hit me no well we'll be
[26:01] doing your funeral you're not gonna have
[26:05] them but there might be an angel they're
[26:07] going like you do that I couldn't I
[26:11] can't stop okay stop the train but you
[26:14] understand what I'm saying let's not be
[26:15] it's not be let's not go over on the
[26:17] other side well whatever I do it doesn't
[26:19] matter you but we're fearful not fearful
[26:22] it's like this we shouldn't fear being
[26:27] the Christian
[26:28] but you need to have just a little bit
[26:30] of godly fear knowing that he's the one
[26:34] is in control so these top conducts look
[26:37] to the General Assembly and the Church
[26:39] of the firstborn a you and I are the
[26:41] Church of the firstborn
[26:42] because what Christ did the firstborn
[26:44] the first one to come up out of the
[26:45] grave which are written in heaven so
[26:48] there you're written in heaven and to
[26:50] God the judge of all and to the spirits
[26:52] of just men made perfect right even
[26:56] Jesus a mediator and the New Covenant
[26:58] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[27:00] speaketh better things than that I'm
[27:03] able to what it was Jesus's blood not
[27:07] the blood of a sacrificed with Abel see
[27:10] that you refuse not him that speaketh
[27:12] for they escaped not who refused him
[27:15] that spake on earth much more shall not
[27:18] we escape if we turn away from him that
[27:20] speaketh from him the Holy Ghost the
[27:22] Holy Ghost speaketh from heaven nothing
[27:24] up there but inside here whose voice
[27:28] then shook the earth but now he has
[27:30] promised saying yet once more I shake
[27:33] not the Earth only but also the heaven
[27:35] no we're talking about this time brother
[27:36] man speaks on that he shook the earth at
[27:39] one time now he's going to shake the
[27:41] earth that heaven why is he going to
[27:43] shake it because of us all nature under
[27:46] the stick steel all nature is going to
[27:48] be brought into subjection to the sons
[27:52] of God and this word yet what's more
[27:56] signifying the removing of those things
[27:58] that are shaken as of things that are
[28:00] made that those things which cannot be
[28:02] shaken may remain of what's he saying
[28:05] everything in you you memory the
[28:07] conservation imagination are going to be
[28:09] shook and everything that's going to be
[28:11] shook when on something shades you just
[28:13] come when you shake something what
[28:15] happens two parts fall off alright when
[28:17] you car shakes in that part start
[28:19] falling off alright that's the thing
[28:21] what God doing with us because the way
[28:23] that so easily besets us right no the
[28:27] waves it so easily possesses were
[28:28] supposed to shed it and he may as we
[28:31] read them to hear he may bring something
[28:33] to
[28:33] tension in your life that needs to be
[28:35] shook and he's going to shake what he
[28:39] said you're not a bastard you're a son
[28:41] so he's going to shake you and be
[28:43] thankfull then he shakes you because
[28:45] there's old parts gonna fall off there's
[28:47] old ideas and all these different things
[28:49] are gonna fall off that those things
[28:53] which cannot be shaken may remain that's
[28:55] why this thing's been going on for 60
[28:57] years after the Prophet God has been
[28:59] shaken the people get rid of the
[29:03] riffraff brother Braun says we're not
[29:05] they begin to say I am my father one of
[29:07] these other things that sho can pull
[29:08] away well watch the show that's that old
[29:10] kind of console idea okay and the old
[29:14] Pentecostal idea is watch out speaking
[29:16] in tongues run out that's what they're
[29:18] wrong I don't mind that but you better
[29:21] know what you're doing first because you
[29:23] know the devil can do all that but he
[29:25] can't be the word he can't be the word
[29:29] he cannot put the word together word for
[29:31] word Sunday by Sunday he cannot do it
[29:33] somewhere he'll go off wherefore we
[29:35] receive we receiving a kingdom which
[29:38] cannot be moved thank God let us have
[29:42] grace whereby we may serve God and step
[29:45] complete with reverence
[29:48] that's what said look and godly fear for
[29:51] our God is a consuming fire and that's
[29:54] what happened at Union birth I believe
[29:56] he brings that consuming fire because
[30:00] watch now remember we'll stop right here
[30:03] but look remember it's a continuation of
[30:05] it's not chap man put the chapters in
[30:08] there but Paul's talking he said God is
[30:10] a continue consuming fire let brotherly
[30:13] love continue because remember a time
[30:15] that brother
[30:16] but now remember what happened that this
[30:19] brotherly love or brotherly kindness
[30:22] when Ananias and Sapphira lied to Peter
[30:27] he said you didn't lie to me you lied to
[30:29] the Holy Ghost and they died because
[30:33] what were they doing brother Brown said
[30:35] brotherly kindness what they happened
[30:36] was is that everything was common they
[30:38] had everything together
[30:39] they brought everything together right
[30:41] and I don't know how since the fire said
[30:43] yes see if they would have answered the
[30:45] question a little bit different they
[30:46] might have been okay but Paul said if
[30:47] you get another word pizza did you give
[30:49] all they said yes Peter Caen says have
[30:55] you give all your going together they
[30:56] said yes they might have been okay but
[30:59] he said if you give all and then I said
[31:02] yes we'd give all but they have held
[31:03] back the part and then what happened was
[31:06] today they died you you now listen you
[31:09] think Brett do you think well that's
[31:10] brother communist I mean your thinking
[31:12] your humanity that's not brotherly
[31:14] kindness that was what that was shaking
[31:16] what we always call shaking the bushes
[31:19] go outside and shake the bushes and all
[31:21] kind of stuff fall down all right that's
[31:23] what God was doing he was shaking the
[31:25] bushes and that's what's happening in
[31:29] them if God turns against you because
[31:31] you're because you're want to hear more
[31:34] of the Word of God and you're going to
[31:36] get it and you get it right so remember
[31:40] before we go there are there are
[31:44] teachers in the message I believe we
[31:47] have some good ones but now some
[31:49] teachers are kindergarten teacher
[31:53] you said when you say teacher you go
[31:55] home no there's kindergarten teachers
[31:57] and as a kindergarten teacher my sister
[31:59] I don't know that she can go teach
[32:02] college the next day no she has to study
[32:08] a little bit more and probably a little
[32:11] bit harder instead of going stop doing
[32:14] that
[32:14] my god do you understand what I mean so
[32:16] is this kindergarten teachers this
[32:17] there's elementary school teachers
[32:20] there's high school teachers and college
[32:22] teachers and a lot of times they don't
[32:23] mix why because it's the people they're
[32:25] dealing with okay so there are teachers
[32:29] out there that teach kindergarten but
[32:31] there are guys they gotta be teachers
[32:33] that teach this college so that well you
[32:34] can stand on your own two feet
[32:36] so the kindergarten you know you can t
[32:38] barley stand on your own two feet
[32:40] ask a man she'll tell you they can't go
[32:42] the bathroom while itself and all this
[32:43] other stuff max listen that's babies so
[32:46] there's teachers that teach babies and
[32:48] then you have to figure out where you
[32:51] are in the body of Christ and figure out
[32:53] where you need to go but remember you
[32:56] gotta have five of them that's gonna be
[32:57] so narrow-minded well we just teaching
[33:00] them so everybody else out no you need
[33:02] an evangelist to come every once in a
[33:03] while watch shake the bushes all right
[33:06] all these different things you need
[33:07] somebody to come by and it takes five
[33:11] but you do need good solid teaching
[33:14] because good solid teaching will take
[33:16] you up this statue of a perfect man
[33:17] it will not I mean regular preaching
[33:22] will not take you up to stuff your ugly
[33:25] looma it may get you born again it may
[33:28] get you to realize you need something
[33:31] but the probably God said teaching
[33:33] places you in the body so I want to be
[33:36] placed because you know what like I said
[33:38] before power without character satanic
[33:41] the Powerball listen we all have the
[33:43] power of the Holy Ghost inside of us to
[33:44] create a world of property God said
[33:46] create it and go live on it but you know
[33:50] what one day we just might be able to do
[33:52] that but right now we're not there's a
[33:56] bar holiness what's that bar that bar is
[33:58] that we you and I gotta have more
[33:59] teaching because power without character
[34:02] I love that quote I don't have character
[34:04] but power web characters fit to rule so
[34:07] you come up here to where Peter can set
[34:09] in a building and discern and I sense
[34:12] the fire or discern the thoughts and
[34:14] intents of the heart
[34:15] and and that's okay that we went through
[34:18] the first poll that remember the clock
[34:19] was talking about boom will go first
[34:21] goal was what taking the people out of
[34:23] hand you know that's why they had to be
[34:25] a prayer line brother branham started
[34:29] prayer lines no one else you can't find
[34:31] it nowhere in history that a prayer line
[34:33] was started by no one else so they'll
[34:35] always tell you brother I'm spearheaded
[34:37] the healing campaign you know why I had
[34:39] a prayer line they're attached to people
[34:42] he couldn't call them out he ever talk
[34:44] to him to any to bring him to a line and
[34:46] grab their hand and all that would
[34:47] happen he had to physically touch him so
[34:50] he lined him up and had prayer line so
[34:53] but now remember that was first pull
[34:56] second pole was what in the toxins into
[34:59] the heart the last clock said he said
[35:01] you go to crisis the mystery of God
[35:03] revealed at the very end of the service
[35:05] he said see the clock he said strike two
[35:07] o'clock he said the second pull is over
[35:09] he said you people don't understand then
[35:11] the second pole is over so no more
[35:15] prayer lines no more discerning the
[35:17] thoughts and intents of the heart in the
[35:18] prayer line the third pole is the
[35:20] opening of the word all right so second
[35:22] pole in 1963 was over his corner brother
[35:24] Ram he said second fold over third pole
[35:26] cam right so weep but a lot of people
[35:29] hadn't moved they kind of stuck in that
[35:30] going around forum you know but let
[35:33] brotherly love continue be not forgetful
[35:35] to entertain strangers for therefore
[35:37] some have entertained angels unaware our
[35:40] let's go
[35:45] Thanks
[35:47] [Music]
