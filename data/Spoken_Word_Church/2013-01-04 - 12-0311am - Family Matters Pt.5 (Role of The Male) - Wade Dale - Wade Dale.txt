========================================

holy let's talk about jesus let's talk about jesus through all eternity let's talk about jesus let all the worlds away the power and majesty of such a wonderful let's talk is jesus is let's talk about jesus such as is is amen that's wonderful let's all stand this time we'll change over the service send a black notebook number 28 open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart yes i want to see you shining in the light of your glory holy holy holy holy holy amen that's your desire yeah do you want to see him amen amen he's resurrected sitting in heavenly places yeah we're already raised up supposedly into another dimension amen maybe when we get in another dimension we won't have time changes we'll have to worry about right little donny that's right you know me i announced it at the office several times not someone else too my brother chris forgot something that's okay in october you can forget and all y'all that are late will be an hour early but when you do it this time makes you an hour late so but goodbye to the house of the lord we still have to go through time i'm still here so you love the lord had a good week today seems like a special day to me i don't know to you but this seems like a special day i was um texting bro tom ernest sent me a text this morning said to tell all of you hello and that he loved you and that uh that he said soon probably so that he's out in wichita his home church so you got your bibles let's go ahead and turn to first peter three and get started i didn't bring my diagon out this morning so we'll just read it out of the out of the regular scripture i think you kind of got the the gist of what the diagrap was saying the original being joint heirs instead of just heirs being joined heirs together of the grace of life and that's what we're going to talk about today but the role of the man in doing so there must be headship because we are sheep and we must be led there's got to be someone above us to lead us and guide us like the holy spirit is our god he's to lead us and guide us into all truth is that correct amen all right so let's bow our heads before we get started dear heavenly father we pray today lord that you would again come among us lord in a special way father not as a bystander but an active participant you take over this flesh lord and take over the ears and the eyes of the of the hearer than the seer lord that that we may see what's given to us in this endtime lord we've given we we've been given an opportunity to fulfill your word something that paul and a lot of many of those people those people in the old testament and even in the new testament could not do lord they could not completely take the whole word of god and break it down and and line it up lord where we line up with you but now in the end time you give us that opportunity you sent a prophet lord you sent us the word through that prophet to give us strength lord and to break these things down for us and we take his words and we read them father we know that that was you speaking to us lord so now i pray that as as we speak did it not be man's words or not be a a man's quote but let it be a living reality let it be something that we take home lord and and take part of father and if anything be said that that's not it's not smothered just smothered with the holy spirit lord let it be taken out of our life lord just let it be totally saturated in you lord when we do that then everything falls in line father we pray for the sick it's not here lord be with them and bless them be with the sickness here among us in the sanctuary that should take it away from them father as the word goes forth may you seek and heal and save the lost be with each one father take care of us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit we pray these things in jesus name amen first peter 3 chapter 1. likewise your wives be in subjection to your own husbands if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives we'll get into that a little bit more when we talk about the wives but today is going to be the role of the male or the husband while they behold your chaste or clean conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be that half of be that outward adorning of planting the hair and wearing of gold and putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament that's what it is now see but let it not be let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament what this is the part that's not corruptable the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price for after this matter in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well there's a stipulation there we'll get into that when we get into the to the female part and are not afraid with any amazement he's taking fear out remember fear is what got us here likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor and to the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being joint heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered and you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we come to the time now where we've we've got the uh the marriage part i hope you've really really enjoyed the marriage part now we're going to break it apart and when you break things apart it gets a little more touchy because you got to get down to where you live now you can kind of you can kind of hide behind the husband and wife roll because we're married we two are one you know amanda i'll hide behind him should you get behind me no we're gonna see today man you gotta be first you gotta be first in everything right you gotta be the first one not the first one that thinks of everything thank goodness because we're not infallible sisters today i'll promise you one thing you'll learn we're not infallible right but there's one thing that is infallible and that's the word of god amen if you take the word of god and use it as your head man coming down to the sisters if you stay in line stay in the line of the word then you will not ever fail all right because the words infallible all right so now just to review a few minutes uh you can go ahead and pull that quote up if you want to uh the first one but talking about three-dimensional love everybody understand that we you there's two dimensions in the world that love and that's your body and your spirit but if you don't have that inside of the inside that third round that soul where you can connect now we're not soul mating right now i don't agree with that i don't think that you but still but still in every error there's truth somewhere in there in error there is truth because if you truly are one you're not the same soul we know that but when we come back to eternity or if you have the new birth and i have the new birth then you do have the same soul all right okay so we can safely say we're not soul mating down here but we can safely say that god's doing it all right man now when god put something together that's why the bible says that's why when jesus come he said whatever man puts together may not be right he said but whatever god puts together let no man try to take it exactly let no man try to take it away in other words why he's wanting to put it together is he not perfect he's perfect when he puts something together all right so when you're together as one in christ then then you're perfect we've got to understand that even our role of husband and wife that we saw all of our fallacies and all the things that we did wrong and then the things that we did right we still see that as human beings we're wrong most of the time as human beings right but like i said before you're going to see today if everybody will take their position you say oh my position is way on up here well prove it yeah pretty much now i'm not saying that back i'm not saying that boastfully i'm saying we gotta prove it we gotta prove it right but we gotta start in these primary things if you can't be the head of your own house now before we get started like i said the other day some of you don't have your wives here some of you don't have your husbands here i am these quotes i took off not singling out any one person okay now i'd be lying and standing here and i'd leave this pulpit but i i didn't have one person in mind but i know a lot of you don't have your spouse here but i'm going to read to you what brother brown said i'll let him tell you then you can talk to him about it all right i'm just going to put you the quote down and i'm not going to you know skewer it or or put my own interpretation in it i'm going to read you what what it says so if you look at this one remember never argue have respect for each other all right i thank you man's filter this is the last one we read last sunday so in the review of what we're doing here listen over the grace of god that he will give us understanding of such great mysteries as paul spoke here further on down in ephesians speaking of the husband and wife saying said this is a mystery what is a mystery he just tells you right how the woman should be in respects to their husband right great mystery even the second place i believe it is the entire scripture that reverence was ever spoken to said the woman seeing she reverts her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life now that's what we're going to talk about today the role of the man seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of god man because if you don't she's not right and you know what if you don't and she's trying to serve god you're out of the picture i'll read that to you just a little bit because if you tell her to do something contrary to the word of god your husband tells you something contrary the word of god he's not your head anymore exactly but now brother ram does tell you to still respect the man because that's your husband that's the man you marry all right and if and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a reverent man reverend and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of god then the woman children and all women children of all should respect that servant of god with reverence and everybody says amen is that right now go to the genesis 3 16 this is why that we have this situation we talked about something last sunday but genesis 3 16 until the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee amen all right so there's where your double covenant comes in where man is the ruler now over the woman or the weaker vessel amen thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee all right now under the double covenant this is what we're under right now we're under that covenant where man is the ruler right he's the head he's the head ship sisters whether you like it or not i'm going to read some quotes that that that you may not agree with but you're disagreeing with the prophet you're not disagreeing with me first corinthians 11 3 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ that's the first thing that's the first thing there's that third dimension yeah because without god in that in that soul who's your head satan's your head because you're only you're only two powers amen the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god so we see it every bit come down through there christ when he was on earth he had honor to his father which was in heaven is that correct he knew the one inside of him was greater than this one right here than his flesh man all right he wasn't two people he was one god but he also knew that one inside of him was the one that ruled everything all right is that correct that's one that don't bother me that's one true living god because you know what this is going to get back to when you see god and adam and eve in the garden if you were god standing looking at god the way i explained it yeah he see one that's right you see three right right you see one if we were to look and say well no no there's god and adam and eve no there's god and god made flesh in another form right and then god made flesh in another form amen and then god made flesh another form but what happened satan got to eve and it stopped that exactly right instead of it being god made manifest in another form dick addison sanger dale et cetera et cetera et cetera saying stopped it right right then we had to wait a little while right we had a little wait a little while till that head could come back amen right he didn't leave we're using these words for our own good god never left right yeah we left him right exactly so he couldn't get to us that fellowship was broken by what fear right adam said i'm afraid well then god said i'll put enmity i'll put a division between me and you in other words you're not going to see me like you should until i come back and i come back in flesh and identify who i am he said if you see me you see the father so he was identifying the father right that was in him right then he's telling us now in corinthians which the corinthians had a problem right ephesians didn't have no problem right they were a mature group of people but the corinthians always had problems with marriage and divorce yeah so here is paul coming in in verse 3 of chapter 11. he said would i have you know that the head of every man is christ starting right there right then or and or even the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god right so guys if you're born again you're in the most godly position you can be in according to the scripture right i said according to what you can be in right right excuse me you want to hear that one more time man if you're born again you're in the most godly position you'll ever be in if you stay a man be a man be a husband be a father you are in the position and sisters you're going to see that we're going to talk about that revelation with the sisters where paul said this is a revelation right that a woman reverence her husband well let's go spiritual let the bride reverence christ amen same thing okay you can't separate it but we gotta separate it to get the role of the man under the double covenant we gotta get the role of the man where the man is the one and i'm going to read you some some things that brother brown said that'll shock you maybe but let's go to ephesians 5 and 23. now what is ephesians paul doesn't have to explain so much to the ephesians right exactly because they understood just like we should understand today excuse me my brother andre was saying you know we we've we've got it all here brother claude you know we we i don't say we got it all but i'm saying every revelation has ever been preached in this message have been preached from here so being preached from here then if you didn't accept it you've come out from under your headship that's right let's get back lined up under our headship amen and our headship is christ for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body all right now also but now look the husband can't save his wife right if she's lost he can't save her right right but let's look at that a little deeper if she's a christian and he's a christian she can be saved by the husband i'm not talking about saved and baptizing into the body see i'm talking i'm getting double double scripture here he is the savior of her body right you're the savior of your wife's body right because she can't be circumcised you're circumcised and she's under you that was in the old testament but in the new testament we are all under circumcision but still i'm gonna read you some quotes where she'll never have to give an account for us but we're gonna have to give an account for her so if we can bring her back under that headship savior of the body everybody understands that too far out i don't think so because we're supposed to be one flesh right all right now listen to this did we did you put this up brother joe the note yeah listen the man needs to understand that's what we're going to talk about today both services are going to be on the man so the females you can come back this afternoon you still beat them we're still beating on the mail a man needs to understand his role i looked at her a few minutes ago and i thought man they either didn't turn their clock forward or or uh everybody decided to go fishing but gary crash was here so i know you weren't using this boat a man needs to understand his role so he can know how to act and react to situations in a marriage that's your position man and be obedient to that position the female should also understand what the male's role is so she can help him right you're not gonna pull apart right so if today if you sisters will listen let god and let the prophet and the scriptures tell you what you're supposed to be looking for so even though you some of you young ladies that are not married are looking or maybe on the internet that's looking this will help you to find somebody that maybe is already in that position and thank god because boy your life will be a whole lot easier oh yeah right right i said a whole lot easier i didn't say easy i said a whole lot easier the female should also understand what the male's role is so she can help him she's supposed to be to help me right right what one given to help all right fulfill his role you take to help me out so she can help him fulfill his role according to god's word because if sisters if you rule the house you have not you have not only dishonored yourself you've dishonored your head right now you've took him out of his position you took him out but man if you know what you're supposed to do and you let her take him out it's doubly on you the man can put the woman back in line but the man has to put the man back in line a woman can't put the man back in line everybody understand that right i mean you can get all jumbled up there but the man is the head he's the one that's going to put his self in christ should put him in line brothers we got to listen to god we got to listen to god and in the situation the things we do we got to listen to god and do the godly things to bring our sisters maybe that are not in the sanctuary with us or our brothers to bring them under that but how are we going to do it if we don't understand our role right so he can know how to act and react to situations in a marriage i know we've all reacted wrong yeah right there man to into a lot of situations we've reacted wrong why that's what i said you know a couple of sermons ago pray before you fight that's right then fight nice yeah but i always told the kids you don't quit fighting i said fight nice but look man be obedient to that position right you're not this great big king ruler that has nobody over you because right there with you is the king of kings amen he's the ruler he's the one that rules but then the female should understand though that through you man through you you can be put in line through the man the woman can be put in line and be under subjection and do the right thing for god everybody understand that say amen amen all right now a few things i want to say that i didn't have that i didn't write down but we need to sisters you need to compliment him you're you're not an accessory like a purse or an accessory like a a new belt or a wallet or something no your your june is me mate manifest in another form right amen but it is another form and it's another form that you've got to deal with right she's not made like you man's made masculine we're made to think things out we're made to do you know do different things we're we're supposed to you know build the nest not sitting on the eggs right right i know i don't know there are some birds eagles certain things that sit on the nest but in most cases men are not supposed to have babies so that's what the female female is more of a homebody right she's more the emotional she's more of the of the you know you say well we're going to go out and eat you know we're going to go out and eat and we're going you know i come in i i brought the i brought the money in this week and we got some extra money we're going to go out and eat she's like honey we ain't got enough money to go out neither or i'm not hungry or something you gotta agree compliment him say hey i appreciate that but now remember one thing you got to support him yeah you know what support me that's like you got an army out here fighting you got to bring up the support you got to support that man but now look you said well i wouldn't support my man well you know what he may not be in his position yet or you may not be in your position yet but we got to understand our position you've got to be supportive right whatever it is sarah supported abraham amen in two things that seemingly we thought was wrong i'm fixing to give my wife to a king telling you're my sister and she said okay she must have no they've got her ready right read your bible they got her ready she went standing in there fussing and throwing us flinging hair pins and no she was under subjection and that's why she called abraham lord because she trusted him there must have been something there yeah she trusted god enough to believe that abraham was doing the right thing and it's for our example in the end time all right that we are sarah we're supposed to to be like that to abraham but abraham she called him lord or ownership in other words sarah was saying whatever this is he still owns me he's my ruler we took each other and he's my ruler he's my owner he owns me not a slave but he owns me all right and we'll read we'll see in just a little while that that god didn't kill sarah because of abraham amen right god couldn't go and get sarah he had to go through abraham to get to sarah that's why i said if you've got your head shipped right christ your head man you're the head of the female or your wife i'm going to use wife because you can't be headship over women right right okay for your wife all right then what's going to happen is then there you go savior of the body god has got to look at abraham before he looked at sarah he saw a righteous abraham and forgave sarah because brother rabbi said you were reading them in he couldn't touch sarah because she was part of abraham amen and they weren't not like adam and eve they weren't they were not in other words sarah didn't come out of abraham but under all the the the word of god and what god put together let no man take asunder they were so much one that god couldn't destroy sarah without destroying abraham amen all right now what about that today he said oh that's back in the old testament did we tear that page out and throw it out that's come to here let's come to this day to this age all right so let's go and pull up quote number one which is titan church age now this is going to kind of put it all in perspective now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male excuse me that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat right but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail because i'm going to tell you something just a few minutes i'm going to show you you females are sisters you don't have to worry about getting a sermon together you don't have to worry about the souls of all these people in this church no you got to worry about your home right i listen but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted i didn't say that he did any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertains to a man or cut her hair right she has never wear a garment that's pertaining to a male or cut her hair and i know this is closing on holding this but he put it in here i didn't when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself right and when a woman invades the pulpit which is command she must not do she shows what spirit she is being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true in their words man be a lie right amen all right let's go to number two is your life worthy of the gospel may you men that's got your wives and let them be the boss of the house and lead you around may the god of heaven give you grace to set your foot down and bring that woman back to her right mind again she must be crazy i'm going to read that again that's what he said yeah and realize that that's your place in christ right not a boss now but you are the head of the house remember she's not even in the original creation she's only a byproduct we went through that last week she only byproduct of you you see how personal that is right you don't know about adam and eve she's a byproduct of you give by god to you to take care of you what to be your support or your accessory or compliment you but remember we're not infallible we do make mistakes right but if we're god led god's going to keep us in line hey god whips us amen god whips us i actually whip this morning with you cause we're the first partaker i'll read that in just a few minutes she's only a byproduct of you give by god to you to take care of you to keep your clothes clean and fix your meals and so forth she's not your dictator you american women run around with a gob of pain on your face and your nose up in the air it rained and drown you yeah didn't think you're some sort of a dictator you are to assist him but not to a real son of god you are to a but not to a real son of god right all right number three just one more time lord let me say this my friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you bring back the old-fashioned prayer meeting old-fashioned repentance when they stayed to the altar until they were dead and finished with sin you never seen a woman go to the altar and die out the sin the next day come back with bob hair paint her face there's no such the holy spirit teaches nature does nature of the holy spirit you've never seen women going out and dressing sexy come in and try to cover themselves up you never seen a man that was afraid to stand up and afraid his little wife would leave him or something another because he took the initiative there's a word we're going to deal with he took the initiative well man were man in them in them days they spoke they were man they were they governed their house they were the head of house but this fancy america all right let's go to second timothy two we're going to talk about the head of the house remember what i said about initiative this is where we're going to start now this is where your sisters i want you to understand this is what god is wanting us to do as men as head of the house this is what we're supposed to do the husband that laboreth that's the th on the end of that so if you're married you're going to be laboring every day for years a long time anyway the husband that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits consider what i say paul said the lord give the understanding in all things right okay so men the husband we're the first partakers of the fruit we are to be the head of the house now i've got the definition of head on here but they don't right there but you pull up the next one if you want to head beans top or beginning the head of the chattahoochee is where the chattahoochee river begins that's the head the headwaters all right so it's too it's to it's at the top or the beginning but now look brother brown said you got to take the initiative initiate to instruct in the principle of something to start brothers to start to initiate to take the initiative whatever is needed in this relationship should be started by the male or the husband whatever is needed in this relationship should be started by the male or the husband you're going to see we're not going to talk about much about dating but brother branham hated it that the women were calling to me the boys and things like that he hated that because why that took the man out from under the roll it's put the woman up as the head calling the boys i know what happened this day and age but it didn't change i mean god hadn't changed the man's the male should call the female whatever is needed in this relationship should be started by the male or the husband his role is to initiate whatever is needed to line up with the word of god amen amen his role is to initiate start be the first one be at the beginning glory his role is to initiate whatever is needed to line up with the word of god now let's go to number four quote number four excuse me let's read the whole quote oh my poor dejected friend the devil might have took you sister out yonder to a place where you never do desire to let your hair grow might get you the place where you think that some pastor is nonsense when he's preaching you pure holiness the way you should dress some of you man out there that goes around and does these things you ought not to do and you men that let your wife do a thing like that and smoke cigarettes i got a little respect for you even as a man now that's exactly right you know a man's the head of the house as long as he takes his place you see what the prophet said as long as he takes his place but i but we i i don't i like to see a man a man a man's not judged by how many muscles he's got that's a beast a man's not judged by the brony muscles but he's judged by the bags and the knees of his pants where he's been praying that's what takes a man let's go to the next one number five expectation let's go through the underlying part now brother let's get plum back office territory talk about satan all right let's come back to god come back to the altar rebuild the altar again that's been torn down and build up your home take them cards off the table and all them old love story magazines and open up the bible and read the bible and pray and just don't get down and say bless my family mary and joe and john and all them and get to bed no sir stay there with god oh my that's desperation but you know what to make a home desperate the male the husband must initiate we're the stronger women sorry we are the stronger you're the weaker vessel we're supposed to see things first now that doesn't mean in human terms and human things right you women sometimes are more you know uh thoughtful about even praying for people i guess more than males because you have more feelings involved but i know a lot of times and i've seen it happen in in dad's life and i'm gonna go ahead and say this but my mom's not here but a lot of things mom would question but dad wouldn't give an answer why did you do this why did that happen and jim said why we're waiting on god we're waiting on a clear-cut answer from god whether your opinion is right or not at the time we still got to wait on god now god listens to you sister sure if you don't cut your hair because if you cut your hair he's not listening to you right so just be patient you're supposed to be reverent to the man right man not like um dave ramsey says the last thing a man needs that's down on his luck is a barking chihuahua dog chewing on his ankles so same way in the gospel no those little yappings you're all a dog napping at your ankles when when you're waiting on something from god now it says if you're in that position right that's the question you've got to ask yourself first husbands am i in this position if i am this is what we're going to do amen if not then you get in your position you seek god for answers to your questions all right let's go to the next one number six greater than solomon is here in 1963 and you men that can't stop talking and looking at women and morally dressed the idols of the day you man that haven't got enough real grace in your heart to make your wife and kids quit doing such a thing as that the love of god isn't anchored in your heart don't be called the son of god you're still in sodom a man that can't take over his house god ordained him to do yeah and you deacons it's mad two or three times of course we don't have that problem here we praise the lord and you men that run out on your wives and try to hold your profession you women that cross the other way no where's the head yeah you women who's trying to be the head that's what he's saying you women that cross the other way you people that hit behind the cloak of the church shame on you he said yeah shame on you if you don't belong to your crew you have nothing to do with him shame on you shame on your men that won't do what you got to have grace in your heart to make your wife and kids quit doing such a thing as that what dressing immorally that's what he's talking about and the men and the men and the boys gawking at the women dressy morally if he would look that in this day in time he'd he would have probably been like uh like somebody was saying one time said lord just put my eyes out yeah you know so i don't see any of it but never where you look in this damn time it's there so let's go to the next one number seven identifications now if you find your place sister don't let don't let me hurt you or brother but you'll find your place in a word as a christian not what the creed said that's down here in this lower cannon fodder that's going to be destroyed right so that's nobody that's born again everybody's not born against cannon fodder right sorry that's what he said your cannon fodder because you're going to be here when he's talking about you're still going to be here when the destruction happens correct see you find your place as a christian because your character is molded as christ amen you are zoe the same as he was zoey amen amen if you're born again today you're as much as zoe is the zoe that's your head christ then if the bible said for a woman not to cut her hair how can you do it right you say a man to be a rule of the house how can you women be what's the matter with you men that sons of god see see you don't find your place see we're wanting to be placed all up in this headstone and we're wanting to have all these places up here up here in the sky have we got our place at home yeah if you say no if you say no don't talk about the other things what brother brown said he said you start climbing up here and he said you think well i'll just have godliness what'd he say you'll fall yeah problem people you'll fall i didn't say that brother brown said that let's read the rest of that you're invited to take come and take his character by having his character in you it mows you into the same mind that he was and his mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do amen always he said i do always that what the father tells me right let me go one more quote and then i'll uh make a comment this is the token now listen to this they should love one another believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly now you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe it now right it's time for to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the bible believe christ love and honor and respect one another man respect your wife you respect your home bring your home together because remember now what's he talking about what was the token the blood on the doorpost was not just for the mail it was for everyone in his household but the male had to put it on there first partaker if he was lazy and didn't do it it wasn't just him it was his family was cursed right because the firstborn died right right and you gotta remember if he was the firstborn from his mother and father he died yeah right right it wasn't just the father was exempt and all of us know if he was the firstborn standing there he died man respect your wives you respect your home bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one but the whole home too had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love each other and believers should separate themselves from the world you remember brother around i'm telling the story about the the kid you know walking up to the to the dad inside the house there that night at the of the passover and uh he said that is everything all right he said son everything's all right that's right daddy are you sure everything's all right yeah everything's all right now if he was a dilatory dad and he said yeah everything's all right he didn't put the blood on him and he didn't get his put into his position then his children died and if he was the firstborn he died right and he didn't say okay son why don't you go peek outside and see what's going on no he was the head they come and talk to him he was the one that was responsible for that family and husbands you are responsible for your wives all right so don't think we can sit back and and you know sit back in our easy chairs and say well let's god if we get them lined up no what i'm trying to tell you today you gotta line up first right amen man initiative right you take the initiative she is naturally a follower right sisters you'll naturally follow somebody you trust right because you're feeling your emotion you'll follow something you trust all right so if they can't trust in you brothers you're not in your position so forget about that position right you'll never get to that position until you get to your own position in your house right all right now let me make a comment before we go to governor to initiate or to take the initiative i'll give you an example brother joe canada sitting in the back back there he's the one that does all of our computers and he a lot of times he doesn't get to participate out here in the in the service but he is a man that i respect because he takes his children and what does he do he teaches them he started to teach his children about god is that right that writes this phrasal verb he started teaching his children he took the initiative why he was the head he took the initiative to start a little bible study and those two kids probably know more about the bible than i do that's why we don't let them play bible trivia right on sunday afternoon we start playing a little bible trivia and sometimes you know and sometimes you ain't got a clue right through so-and-so's brother of half-brother of so-and-so and his name's about that long but but as far as the basics of starting something brother josh felt led right see husbands you got to be led yeah you got god's already took the initiative this is this big word right here this eternal word of god he's already wrote down what we got to do he already took the initiative hey he don't need us he could have stayed eternal and stayed by himself for an eternity and still existed he didn't want to right he didn't want to because inside of him he wanted fellowship right he wanted something that he could look at and talk to and commune with right right but he could have because he's self-existing so he didn't need a wife to exist he didn't need friends to exist right but he wanted that so he took the initiative to build a world for us to live on right then he took the initiative to make a man yeah and take a woman out of a man and say here fellowship now i can fellowship with myself right people are like mine but then we know what happened in the garden but you know what god didn't destroy the world he didn't take every human off the earth and start over again no his master plan was starting to roll right his master plan of having head ship he was the head adam and eve right right so brothers what must we do we must take the initiative glory i'm saying everything right but now your wife's gonna come up with some good ideas so don't just we're not saying it's a single thing i'm just saying what god said the head of the house is supposed to be if you're under subjection to your husband he takes the initiative right because listen folks if we make a mistake we got to answer for you and for and to god for me and her all right man if she makes a mistake she's just got to answer to me really i'm talking about a human mistake ain't talking about not being i'm talking about born again believers trying to get in their headship where they make a mistake because remember what the brother brown tell that woman she committed adultery on her husband right she said i've confessed that she said you didn't do it to god right he said you did it to your husband you've got to go tell him remember that's what she didn't want to do right oh it'll tear up my marriage but come to find out he did the same thing but you know what brother brown said they came together confessed their sins and left and brother brown said that they're christians now he was making a comment on how they become real good christian but see she had that so much in her though till she had covered it that's the one that he said that that a 55 gallon oil part owner wouldn't do any good because what she done she had done that and she had stacked it way back into the gable part of her soul she forgot about it in other words but god didn't forget about it right same thing with you and if you ever want to get anything from god you better do the same thing you better come down and confess to your wife have we really confessed to our wife because brother brown said you go confess to him say it then see god's already left you yeah so that didn't mean she was not savable it's just that god wasn't going to hear her until he went to her to the husband now what about a problem here with the village fixing to take this woman that he thinks is abraham's sister and then god says i know you're a righteous man or i wouldn't have told you this right tell us you've got to go get abraham right i bet a villain's head just started spinning around what i didn't do anything wrong no he went to abraham right and abraham restored that kingdom back because that man had to go through headship abraham was the head at the time abraham was the head he had to go back to abraham and apologize for abraham lying to him but that's the way god wanted it done same way with i'm talking about your sisters and men and brothers you got something you hadn't confessed you pray to god from now until the rapture takes place and you probably won't be in it you gotta confess to your wife confess to your spouse right then both of you go to god and say god don't ever let me do that again i'll stay right here under my headship my ruler but teach all right let's go to number two governor govern means to rule or be the lord govern and rule means to what control direct or strongly influence the actions because we can't make you sisters do things the more we try to make you do something it's the worst thing to do right you know i mean if your wife's cutting her hair or she's not coming to church starts throwing her makeup out the window and throwing her scissors out ain't gonna get it right that's right but you can strongly influence her action by the way you act right right you gotta see it in you first she's gotta see it in you first she can't see god no other way than through you to control direct or strongly influence the actions and conduct of others now not to control with an iron fist like brother brown said are to direct god doesn't god doesn't control us with a with an iron disposition or with he with what love grace and all these things he governs but we're supposed to govern right we're supposed to govern but man is not to rule with an iron fist but with love and correction right so we don't control as in dominate right but we control in the fact that hey you're doing this wrong let's listen to what brother brown said or watch what he said let's go to genesis 3 16 though first and read it again until the woman he said i will grate them all apart like sorrow not conception and sorrow thou shalt bring four children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee that's where you governor the rule part all right what's he going to do to control and he shall control or direct or strongly influence your action yeah that's what he's saying the male is going to from now on from now on he's going to to take and he's going to try to control and direct you in a loving sense of way not in a not in a demanding way let's go to first peter then three and read what we read this morning for after this matter in the old times the holy women also who trusted in god adorn themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands trusted god being in subjection even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well know as long as you do that and are not afraid with any amazement right now there's times in our marriage that that that honestly when june and i were were married there was always a fear of losing her because i wasn't born again there was no typos there was no there was no sure i wasn't a christian and she wasn't a christian but when we become christians that just took that thing just exploded that thing out of the way wouldn't matter if she left and went you know went on a vacation talk about going with her sister somewhere she said are you are you you know okay with that i said yeah i'm okay with that i don't have any problem at all because i trust her why do i trust her it's not maybe that i don't trust her i mean i trust her but i trust the goddess in her right man so i trust the goddess enter now she's not born again you better watch out right even being born again saying contempt you enough is like uh it's like we always told the uh kids at the youth banquet it's you we trust satan we don't right right so if you put the two together we don't trust you if you got the devil in you all right all right but we do we gain are not afraid with any amazement in other words right no surprises no surprises jen and i confessed ourselves to each other 12 years ago we're clean we're done that's finished no more to happen again not a problem with that you know what i can do i can put that over here on the shelf and forget about it because that thing's clean man done finished so i'm not afraid of that anymore when we start getting this fear factor out of the way because that's what god started abr adam was fear he had fear in him why you done something wrong right right he does something wrong he was in fear of what god would do to him well if you take a godly person a godly husband and a daughter and wife you gotta worry about that you don't have to worry about it that just takes all that out of the way i want those things taken out of the way glory because remember brother i'm talking about those filters or flues getting stopped up see that stops it up i got this fear i got this fear now brother brown will tell you and i didn't bring the quote but he said have a godly fear is different than being afraid having a godly fear because fear and reverence go together right he's afraid that he wouldn't serve god so there is before he had a fear right that he wouldn't be serving god but he wasn't afraid we're not going to be afraid of god right never are we to be afraid of our husband you're never supposed to be afraid of your husband right all right if you're afraid of your husband and your husband's not in his right role your husband's not in the right role if you're if you're afraid to go home somebody's saying man amen yeah quote number nine do you know ladies it's wrong to wear slacks do you know that do you know it's wrong to cut the locks of your hair off do you know what's wrong mister for you to continue to smoke and act the way you do do you know it's wrong for you not to be the husband of your house your wife get a little temper spell and kick you out the door and say yes bless your heart honey i'll come right back you have not been married for 32 years and i slept on the couch one time that's because the kids were sick and i just sleep on the couch i'm gonna sleep in my own bed she might go somewhere else but i'm gonna leave my bed i heard this one time and it's kind of funny but the guy a guy said he bought these real nice beautiful couches soft leather and all that stuff you know and somebody said well man what'd you spend so much in the couch he said cause i'm gonna be sleeping there most of the time just wake you up a little bit how can you listen to this did you know how can you be a tender at the house of god when you can't even control your own house that's exactly right do you know sister that your husband is not only your husband he is your ruler god said so because that the husband was not deceived the woman was deceived and you preachers will continue to make women pastors and preachers in church knowing that the word of god condenses it now we know who he's talking to he's not talking to us he's talking to the denominational world when he's talking about that but how can you be a tender because remember excuse me a um a bishop supposed to be the husband one wife but he doesn't exactly have to be married to preacher to preach right paul wasn't but if you're a deacon you need to be married who said be control of his family in other words how are you going to be a tender tender or are somebody that has some you know authority in the church how you going to be that if you can't even ruin your own home all right so if you can't control your own house how can you be attended at the house of god that's exactly right your husband's not only your husband but he is your ruler all right so let's go to what's the neck coming up okay while you're looking at that let me read this but being the head and being the one who is to initiate things also means the man is responsible you're responsible anyone in a leadership role is responsible for those who they are to lead and will answer to god for their role right that's why jacob said this is a fearful place the house of god right they're saying that this ain't something that this ain't a job that that i wish on anybody but if it's a job that god gave us to do we're going to do it right now okay but we got to make sure that we're right we're first protectors brother dale's first particularly of the fruit just like we read the husband so see we can spiritualize this a lot but let's just let's stay down here all right why didn't abraham why didn't god kill sarah sitting right there denying and lying right in the face of god sitting there as a mortal man eating flesh eating bread drinking milk said why i never said that she said i never said that uh oh my tell god that he's a liar to his face but he couldn't take her why she's a part of abraham amen he couldn't hurt her without hurting abraham now you women see where you belong and the bible said you women be like sarah was which adorned herself and modest apparel lived honest and true to their own husband loving him so much that i put he that he no he said he and he said she that's what brother brown made she called him her lord ruler ownership all right to initiate and govern brothers we got to remember we're the initiator but we're also the governor got it all right we're the governor of our home we're also the ruler of our home there's things that we must do to clean out our home answer to god you will for not doing it right all right but the best thing to do this is this is just to make it all come together and we'll stop in just a few minutes so i just got a few more quotes we'll stop for this afternoon we know what's right and wrong if we're a message believer or a born-again believer let's say that burning and blood we should know what between right and wrong you know even though if you've been in the message two weeks two months two years you do have a you do there's one thing you know we are supposed to live an exemplary a life better than everybody else exemplary thank you yeah you're supposed to live that before not only your church members it's easy to live a christian life right here easy oh you get the feeling and worshiping the praise god and my brother's over here praising god and my sister will be praying but we hear the message of the hour and we sing our songs and and and i'm being real but go to work go out here go to walmart drive on the highway somebody cut you off man you're supposed to be exemplary you're supposed to live an example life it starts with us not the sisters exactly it starts with the men when we get to acting up it's just going to happen that the women are going to act up it's going to happen yeah sorry but if we get ourselves in line with god and what god wants us to do i'm telling you people i'm going to make this plane and i'm going to make it clear and i may make it clear and plain again we as men as husbands in this message if you're born again believer born again born again and believe the message of the hour and try to live it our life should be there should be somebody say something one day like ain't nobody ever lived a life like that before you've changed you've become a new person a new creature a new creation not just a god your wife your family your neighbors what if the neighbors see you walking around in shorts and smoking a cigarette well i thought he went to that church up there that they didn't believe in that stuff i'm not saying you did it i'm just telling you what what a role you and i should present i'm talking about males now females you can say amen all you want to because i'm on i'm on the mend now you're supposed to be the steward of your own home you're supposed to be the guy that makes the decisions the final decision now not just the but the final decision you're supposed to get the last word and it's not yet there now we're not supposed to be we're not supposed to be that's what i always say i'll get the last word in every argument but you're supposed to come together but sisters if you trust if you trust there's one thing i believe that sister peggy give you believe her husband and trust him so if he said honey we're gonna drive off that cliff keep shaking your head we're gonna die if we're gonna drive off that cliff god's got something in store now i'm not joking because she reverence her husband yes right and whether he'd be wrong i'm not saying you know i'm just for an example will they be wrong she trusts that man enough to know that if he's a godly man he got off somewhere but god's going to bring him in line but he's got to bring him in line first he's got to bring me in line first he's not trying to line up sister june he's trying to line up brother wayne then sister june sees by the way then there's the example is that too far off sisters you gotta look at your husband where's brother joe oh that's right y'all remember brother joe he's in california with us with his daughter and remember her for cancer i just missed him when i walked by there back there and didn't see him here but and that's another example too brother joe's one of the kindest men that i know very helpful but you know what he's that way at home away from us that's what makes a difference he's the same way right he's the same way we should all be the same way we shouldn't we shouldn't put on our robe and our and our priestly uh garments to come to church we're supposed to be that home amen and sisters you're supposed to look up to your husband right look at all your lives i want you to just not today but sometimes go home and just look at yourself and there's always people there's always regrets oh we're human i should have but like brother david marlo and i were talking about his wife uh becky today was 30 something years and she had passed away and i remember when i was younger but he went to the grave he come in today and he said man he said it's a bad day his wife and i thirty-something years ago and sister baker was a godly woman i remember and he said i'm ashamed of all the things that i did afterwards and he said the devil tells me that i'm lost but he's sitting here today i said brother david the reason the very reason you shouldn't believe that is number one that was a liar and the father of it number two is i said sit in sit and sit in here and just get wet get under the fountain you're going to get wet just keep coming to the fountain and i told him i said if it took god to reveal to me today that god take my human life today to save my children let me drop dead but see that's not gonna that's that's making a deal with god you don't do that but you can also say that as a human though and that's what i said brother dave when i said brother david her passing away he said well it might have been different no it's not because that's not what happened but that woman went down with the testimony she was a godly girl pretty girl never know her to even you know say anything wrong i remember when i was little there's the testimony there's the 30-year testimony that goes for eternity that testimony will last right up into glory you know what he said he said he went through the grave yesterday and he told me he said i want to see her again i said you get bored again you'll see her again stay here stay under the fountain stay where you need to be because a life live is better than any sermon and we fail and we make mistakes but men you need to stay men so that your wife reverence you so much that whatever decision if y'all come together and sure it is you need to come together to make family decisions and financial decisions but ultimately sisters the male has the last word in any decision if you decide to do something together that's okay but remember if he's a godly man not just what brother said brother i said if that big word if he's a godly man you got to trust that god's dealing with him in some way to just back off say okay lord whatever my husband decides that's what we're going to do amen but now remember we're going to talk about this afternoon if he does something out from under that if he comes out and says no we're we're no we're we're going to go to the baptist church tomorrow you can go ahead and start cutting your hair wearing come on people right you'll know one thing's for sure he's not under the headship of the holy spirit right right right so you don't have to do that all right there was a situation happening a few days ago or about a week or so ago there was a a person leaving a church him and his wife and they left the church but then they told the pastor they were going to this is a message church they told the pastor they were going to i think claude told you about it when does he not go to his church but they left and then the the man that left told the pastor said well well my wife wants to go here but i want to go to brother clark's church but we're going to start coming here and where's the headship in that right you know what i tell my wife i tell you she wants to get in the car and go to another church go to it right but i'm coming here right because i believe that's what this for the words at right okay but for me to tell the pastor of the church i'm going to that i don't want to come to your church but my wife does so we're going to do what she says in other words that's not right that's not right right and your sisters we'll talk about it this afternoon if anything your husband tells you to do this outside of the word of god then he has taken his self you haven't removed him god has removed him from your headshot right now because he's not coming down under the word of god you're here he's now moved over to here now you're not going to move up here you're still here because you're still supposed to respect that man anyway right i'll read it but brother brown said you respect him but you don't have to go to church with him or don't have to cut your hair do what he says what god's directly speaking to you he's your head right when it comes to matters of the word but when it comes to the matters of us living together and us being husband and wife tell me one thing answer me a question what would happen if one day that did happen one day your husband wants to come up and say we're not gonna go to church there anymore we're gonna go to the baptist church i'm gonna talk about another message church baptist church what would you do sister when you love that husband you love him so much but now let me tell you something this is what the prophet said i didn't i didn't bring the quote but i'm gonna go this way just for a few minutes but you do one thing you still reverence that husband you don't separate yourself from that man please don't because you'll you'll you'll do something that'll cause him to do something wrong maybe same way with you men you know the bible says that if you cause your wife to commit adultery that you're guilty right you cause your wife to commit adultery you're guilty of it not your wife i mean she's guilty of it but you're guilty first but you're the what you're the head you're the one on top you're the beginner on the top you're the one that's supposed to initiate you're the one that's supposed to govern but you'll answer for your role but she won't have to answer for europe but you gotta answer for your role and her role all right let's go to the last quote number 11. but you men are responsible listen now i think that we get that man and woman now a woman is let me get this right good now so that you can see it woman is subject to her husband and the bible said that a man should rule over his wife but how they've changed that the woman rules over the land now you stay home john we're not going and that settled it yes my dear see but let me tell you something mister you're going to have to answer for your wife but your wife is never going to have to answer for you you are the head of the woman and god is the head of the man now listen that's in everything right when that double covenant come it wasn't just a double covenant for just adam and eve it stays forever i said forever down here goes back up when we go back to glory right sure you are the head of the woman and god is the head of man therefore he said let the man cut his hair because of christ and let the woman have her hair for his for if she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband see what i mean or what the scripture says all right let's go to 12. questions answers too if i seen a man come in here with long hair hanging down his back like a woman i'd say mister why don't you go to the barber shop you look like a woman see but men usually don't do that in other words men don't even come in with long hair see not as man now not as the infallibility of man they're just as guilty as the woman and by the way a man that'll let his wife do that he's guilty double of it yeah because when you urge her for authority and she's doing it and you're saying it's okay that's where the double part comes in you're guilty for saying it's okay she's guilty for doing it and you're guilty for letting her do it all right i'm sorry this is the prophet not me and by the way a man that'll let his wife do that he's guilty double of it because he's supposed to be the one that has to say so in the house and that man can't even rule his own house how could he do it in the house of god all right i'm not scolding you to be mean i'm only so happy for you i just don't want satan to get foot in any way anywhere see i want you to move upward not backward yeah don't never let no man deceive you by some enchantments or something another looked like or something saying oh well it don't see that's the way satan interprets the word to eve see you believe just what the word says all right all right last one you know i'll make a few comments we'll stop right there and we'll start on uh that god is still the ruler over the woman if her husband is not born again or not a christian questions and answers on hebrews listen here the man is a ruler don't you think don't you think you can rule the house holding the system you're not the ruler of the house you're absolutely you're not a slave now but your help mate and adam the man has the rule over his wife and he's responsible solely for his wife god makes the man answer for his wife now read and see if god says that now and then he read the scripture somebody asked a question about that but we've got to be good stewards amen we got to be good stewards of our home that's why a lot of you are taking those classes with the uh financial peace university which is it is faith-based the bible tells us to be good stewards of our money remember remember the guy that went out and buried his money actually god took that money away from you because you didn't do something with it you got money buried in your house i'm telling you what the bible says fixing the spending he said makes his bill fall down it goes the dollars are so folded like this until they won't come out you know they say i'm just telling you what the bible says remember he gave so much to one guy he gave so much to another and so much to another and this guy just hit his money and didn't do nothing with it and the other ones went out and did something with the money what'd he do it was an increase these other ones came out he used their money right they did right things we're supposed to be that right and i'm telling you people exemplary we're supposed to be where they everything we do in word indeed put it in scripture do all in the name of the lord jesus i'm gonna tell you something i heard dave ramsey the other night we we were there and and kind of shocked some of the people but i'm gonna tell you something you us in our finances his daughter bounced the check i told you before june june bounce one check 1981 we'd never bounce another one he made his daughter go to the bank and apologize to the bank president for bouncing the check amen you know why he said because you lied to that banker when you write a check knowing there's no money in your funds you're lying to the bank and saying that it's there and folks that's not godly ain't nothing godly about that it never will be godly and it's never going to be god you'd be a good steward because you know what people are looking at you people are watching you you got it don't spend it right right that's right ain't got it don't spend it right sorry it's like the banker told daddy you know about man's parents you know he didn't he didn't say that because we bounced checked he didn't say that because we foreclosed on loans did he because every time we went to that bank and we needed some money he loaned us money guess what we did we did something very strange we paid it all back yeah on time and ahead of time but you know what you say well that's just that's just man no i'm telling you i'm going to read it this afternoon in a leadership role everybody's looking up to you right so men if we're in a leadership role that's why when jim bounced that check in 1981 i took over the checkbook now honestly i gave it back to her about 10 years ago just in case someone what happened you sisters i know a lot of you control the checkbook and that's fine i don't mind that but you your husbands need to know also so i gave it over to her so if i were to drop dead she wouldn't be lost and not know where to find stuff what bill to pay and how to pay it and all these things uh you know i'm sorry but you're going to give an account for every idle word right right that you do in life but don't say forgive me lord and then do it tomorrow yeah that don't work either right you've been drinking all your life stop drinking right simple it don't drink no more man don't say god forgive me god forgive me god forgive me that's one thing god won't do he won't remember what you've done but he knows your heart right and if your heart's not right see god god is god is willing and saying in the scripture to forgive you why because you got to forget you got a heart that wants to be forgotten that's a problem with a lot of you you don't like change and you ain't going to change because you think you're the big guy standing up here you won't change even in that even in a leadership role we've got to still be soft and pliable we still we never never be hard right never be never be where well bless not if you either got to do it no but if god tells you to tell somebody that yeah you better listen to what god said through that person stop the nonsense all of us males take our role as the head of the house keep your wife under control in godly fear and ungodly love because there's one thing's going to happen if she's not a christian she's going to rebel yeah so you've got to know how to handle that you got to say listen honey we'll read it tonight says listen honey let's just sit down and talk about this don't start going in this blessed goddess bless screaming no say look let's discuss this we i've come to a junction in my life where i'm not satisfied with me god's not satisfied with me and we need to get this thing all back together again because like brother brown said without the home in harmony there's always going to be friction there's always going to be those human emotions and sisters you all have the human emotion side more than the man does but i just want to make sure that you understand that because remember when we start talking about the man is a leader we'll go back to ephesians 5 this afternoon as man is the leader he's under the leadership of christ right we lead christ leads us we leave the body or the woman we'll read that this afternoon so let's stand let me read this one thing i'll read it back tonight be careful how you use a role of a leader yeah be careful there's one you need we'll talk about this afternoon be careful being the role of a leader right all right or a ruler because you can be a ruler and become a dictator right or you can become a ruler what brother brown say power without character is satanic or dictatorship but power with character respect to what rule amen what not just this man but your whole family right man we get us in line you know i i don't i don't agree with the if we get our wife lined up we're going to no i believe if we get lined up our wives will get lined up right hey man is that the way it's supposed to be right i didn't make it i didn't make the rule but god told us that our headship was christ and that the woman's head right was the man we can't change that you know what he made provisions for us to live under that and be happy right you hear me one more time he made provisions for us to live under that kind of headship and be happy with it man is happy with a good wife wife is happy with a good husband in this role of leadership let's know 37 inspiring 37 inspire book let's sing praise lord he can't mold you if you're already hard but when your clay and water is there you're pliable he can move am things of the world you know not the world but the things the day-to-day action that we have today let's support glory where they come from oh absolutely oh is we all shall see amen he doesn't leave with iron fist so we should he doesn't leave he leads with nail scarred hands just take this and man it's wonderful when you put it in your mouth but paul said it was real bitter when it got in your belly why but it was starting to become a part of you and you were going to have to live we got to live this thing people we cannot there's not going to be 1160 sermons in glory laid on the shelf somewhere no we're going to be that

was talking about exactly you're gonna be able to say jeremiah you remember all those symbols you saw ezekiel you saw that wheel in the middle of the wheel you saw them four beasts ezekiel never witnessed those four beasts in his own personal life right the line of men and eagle did it but we do but that was what we pull out of the word put in us in our heart and we don't have to read ezekiel

our our life taking control of our family if something going right in your in your house you're responsible right that's right you're responsible man that's why brother brown said you apply that token just like that man did you know what if it'd been me i'd have made sure i would have not just put a little bit i got the biggest lamb i could find that had the most blood and i would have absolutely took that hits up not one hits a branch i pulled up the whole i pulled the whole tree up and i shoved it in there and i made sure why i wanted to make sure that's what we got to do check up and make
