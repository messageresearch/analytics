[42:05] to us Heavenly Father Lord as your
[42:07] Believers have gathered here this
[42:09] afternoon we are very well aware that
[42:11] we're not here by ourselves but Lord
[42:13] there's a supernatural host in this
[42:15] building and Lord your word is said
[42:17] wherever two or three would Gather in
[42:19] Your Name Lord you made us a promise
[42:22] that you would come and you would be in
[42:24] the midst of your people now Lord as I
[42:26] look around this morning there's more
[42:27] than two or three here but Lord there's
[42:29] a houseful of people Lord Believers of
[42:32] your word that have come to receive
[42:34] something from you now father I
[42:36] Surrender myself to you may you take
[42:39] control of me Father may you move me out
[42:41] of the way Lord Lord that the people
[42:43] would not see me they would not hear me
[42:45] but Lord they would see you and hear you
[42:48] oh god father I pray that as your word
[42:50] Goes Forth May the chains of the enemy
[42:52] be broken Lord May the strongholds of
[42:55] the enemy be torn apart oh God lord May
[42:58] the Sons and Daughters of God receive

[43:19] we'll be sure to give you all the praise
[43:22] all the honor and all the glory in the
[43:24] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[43:26] Jesus Christ Christ we pray and all the
[43:29] Believers says amen and amen the Book of
[43:32] Genesis the first chapter and in the
[43:35] 26th verse the Bible said God said let
[43:38] us make man in our image after our
[43:42] likeness and let them have dominion over
[43:44] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[43:47] the air and over the cattle and over all
[43:50] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[43:53] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[43:56] created man in his own image somebody
[43:59] say his own image own in the image of
[44:02] God created he him male and female
[44:05] created he them so it wasn't male only
[44:08] or female only but both male and female
[44:11] and God blessed them and God said unto
[44:14] them be fruitful and multiply and
[44:17] replenish the earth now watch this and
[44:19] subdue it and have dominion over the
[44:21] fish of the sea over the fowl of the air
[44:25] and over every living thing
[44:27] that moveth upon the earth now in the
[44:30] book of Philippians the 2 chapter I want
[44:32] to read one verse there with you
[44:34] Philippians chapter 2 and verse number
[44:37] five uh brother if you could give me
[44:39] just a little bit more in my ear I'd
[44:40] appreciate it amen Philippians chapter 2
[44:43] and verse 5 amen that's that's great
[44:46] amen Philippians 2 and 5 I know it's a
[44:48] very familiar reading to us uh speaking
[44:50] here of our Lord Jesus the Bible says
[44:53] let this mind be in you which was also
[44:56] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[45:00] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[45:03] with God but made himself of no
[45:06] reputation and took upon him the form of
[45:09] a servant and was made in the likeness
[45:12] or we could say image the likeness of
[45:14] men and being found in fashion as a man
[45:18] he humbled himself and became obedient
[45:21] unto death even the death of the Cross
[45:24] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[45:26] him him and given him a name which is
[45:29] above every name that at the name of
[45:32] Jesus somebody say Jesus every knee
[45:35] should bow of things in heaven and
[45:37] things in Earth and things under the
[45:38] Earth and that every tongue should
[45:41] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[45:45] glory of the father amen we ask Lord
[45:48] this this afternoon to add the blessing
[45:49] to the reading of his word as you can
[45:51] have your seats here today amen I want
[45:53] to by the help of the Lord for just a
[45:55] few moments this afternoon speak you
[45:57] here and if I title this I want to talk
[45:59] to you for a few moments on living
[46:01] images amen living images I I believe
[46:05] today that we have gathered here amen
[46:07] and I want to say this I believe that
[46:09] the most solemn or the most powerful
[46:11] confession that you as an individual
[46:13] could make amen is that you are a
[46:16] Christian amen not that you are a a
[46:19] scholar or you are a sport star or
[46:21] you're something in the world but you
[46:23] are a Christian now when I say that I
[46:26] want to say this that Christians amen
[46:28] they must have real confidential Faith
[46:31] the prophet of God said in the images of
[46:33] Christ he said the church can never
[46:35] progress until it knows what grounds
[46:38] it's progressing on and I believe that
[46:40] before anybody can ever move or have
[46:43] real confidential Faith it's first they
[46:46] have to know where they stand and how to
[46:48] stand after they make their stand so if
[46:51] you're going to make the solemn
[46:52] confession of being a Christian then
[46:54] you're going to have to know how to
[46:56] stand how to make the stand now he said
[46:59] I believe that's essential amen for you
[47:01] cannot just headlong plunge into
[47:03] something with faith when you don't know
[47:05] where you're plunging you've got to know
[47:07] and if our faith is set right and in the
[47:10] right position then it gives a constant
[47:14] satisfaction if our faith is set in the
[47:18] right position it gives a constant
[47:20] satisfaction now I believe that we were
[47:23] made or we were created Amen in the
[47:26] image of God I believe that the image of
[47:28] God Amen is the Divine image in Genesis
[47:31] 5:1 the Bible said that this is the book
[47:33] of the generations of Adam in the day
[47:35] that God created man in the likeness of
[47:39] God made he him now we can trans we can
[47:42] transfer that word likeness to image and
[47:44] that word is a figure or it is an image
[47:47] of things amen the Heavenly things used
[47:49] of the moral likeness of renewed men to
[47:51] God it is the image of the Son of God
[47:55] into which true Christians are are
[47:57] transformed so in other words you have
[47:59] an image amen but then there's something
[48:01] happens to transform you amen from what
[48:04] you are into that image now we all know
[48:07] that we were born in sin shape in
[48:09] iniquity come in the world speaking lies
[48:11] right so we were born in the image of
[48:14] sin we were born in the image of the
[48:15] nature of the enemy but God by his
[48:18] transforming power amen has transformed
[48:21] us that we would be a reflection amen or
[48:24] a likeness or a figure or an image amen
[48:27] of the Son of God now I believe this I
[48:29] believe that as Christians amen that we
[48:31] are to manifest the life of Jesus Christ
[48:34] amen in all
[48:35] ways I don't believe we're just to
[48:37] manifest him in church or manifest him
[48:40] in in in just one area amen but I
[48:43] believe we are to manifest him in every
[48:45] area in all the ways of our life now
[48:48] amen I'll say it to you like this when
[48:50] you study the Bible you will see amen
[48:52] that the word Christian or Christians
[48:54] amen is only used about two or three
[48:57] times in the Bible in the book of Acts
[48:59] 11 book of Acts 11 2 verse 26 and when
[49:02] he speaking of Barnabas had found him he
[49:05] brought him under Antioch and it came to
[49:07] pass amen that a whole year they
[49:09] assembled themselves with the church and
[49:11] taught much people amen and the
[49:13] disciples were called Christians first
[49:15] in Antioch in Acts 26:28 then AG grippa
[49:18] said unto Paul amen almost thou
[49:21] persuadest me to be a Christian 1 Peter
[49:24] 4:16 yet if any man suffer as a
[49:26] Christian let him not be ashamed but let
[49:29] him glorify God on this behalf amen so
[49:32] now we see amen that just being a
[49:34] Christian is also going to come with
[49:36] suffering amen are we all on the same
[49:39] page if you're going to be a Christian
[49:41] amen there's going to be an element of
[49:43] suffering now I'll sit to you like this
[49:45] Christian amen means to be a follower of
[49:49] Christ it means to be Christlike amen or
[49:52] like Christ now I'll say this we have so
[49:55] many explanations and definitions of
[49:57] what a Christian is today amen we have
[49:59] around 900 different denominations and
[50:02] each one of those are specifically
[50:04] defining amen what they think a
[50:06] Christian is or what a Christian should
[50:08] be or what a Christian could do but I'll
[50:10] say this thank God for the message of
[50:12] the hour amen that has restored a true
[50:15] Bible definition amen of what a
[50:18] Christian is brother said therefore so
[50:20] many times we hear this expression oh
[50:23] what is a Christian well some people
[50:25] amen limit it to joining a church church
[50:26] Someone said well amen a Christian is a
[50:29] church member someone who takes up their
[50:30] affiliation with a church he said I
[50:33] believe that all Christians should do
[50:34] that but I don't believe that's
[50:36] Christianity see that's what a Christian
[50:38] does after he becomes a Christian but it
[50:41] doesn't mean that because he does it
[50:43] that he is a Christian then some say no
[50:45] it's going to a church and serving a
[50:47] declaration of Creeds and being loyal to
[50:49] those amen things in which the church
[50:51] teaches he said then there are others
[50:53] that say that perhaps packet a little
[50:55] something on them a little cross or
[50:56] something amen that is a sign of a
[50:59] Christian he said there's others perhaps
[51:01] maybe believe if they burn a candle or
[51:03] some kind of a Penance if that's a
[51:05] Christian if they will be merely
[51:06] immersed in water they'll do some
[51:08] sacrifice give some good to the church
[51:10] help the neighbor buy some coal for the
[51:12] Widow some shoes for the orphan that's
[51:14] the act that a Christian should do amen
[51:16] but that still doesn't make you a
[51:18] Christian he said then some says if you
[51:20] pack an image of Christ in your car or
[51:22] on your wall that that is a sign of a
[51:24] Christian well then things are all all
[51:27] right but I don't believe packing an
[51:29] image makes you a
[51:30] Christian now thank God for a prophet
[51:33] that said I do not believe packing an
[51:35] image makes you a Christian he said I
[51:37] believe that being an image of a of
[51:39] Christ makes you a Christian being a
[51:42] image of Christ is what makes you a
[51:44] Christian it's not what we do outwardly
[51:47] amen it's what happened inwardly that
[51:49] makes us what we are so it's not what we
[51:52] pack on the outside or what we what we
[51:54] do on the outside that makes us a
[51:56] Christian amen but it's what happened
[51:58] inwardly that makes us what we are then
[52:01] therefore if he is our image and we are
[52:03] in his likeness and members of his body
[52:06] amen we should be images like him amen
[52:09] then our lives should reflect the image
[52:11] of Christ amen notice it's not our
[52:14] joining church or our packing a crucifix
[52:16] or our emotion but it should be in the
[52:19] living presence of the Living God that
[52:21] is reflected through our life amen
[52:24] listen we can shout every day and still
[52:26] not be a Christian we can put pictures
[52:28] on our wall and still not be a Christian
[52:31] but when the power of God drops in the
[52:33] soul of an individual and changes them
[52:36] amen not just for time but for eternity
[52:39] amen that is what makes him a Christian
[52:42] amen I believe it amen I believe it I
[52:45] believe that it's Jesus on the inside
[52:47] amen working on the outside amen I
[52:49] believe that's what's making the
[52:51] difference amen is Jesus on the inside
[52:54] amen working on the outside you know
[52:56] what the prophet of God says he says
[52:58] you're not a Christian by your desire he
[53:00] said you are a Christian by God's desire
[53:03] so you know what that tells me is we
[53:04] were elected to be Christians we didn't
[53:07] choose to be a Christian we didn't join
[53:09] a church to become a Christian but we
[53:11] were elected by God from before the
[53:14] foundation of the world to be a
[53:16] Christian it's in the Bible John 665 he
[53:19] said therefore said I unto you that no
[53:22] man can come unto me except it were
[53:24] given unto him of my father speaking on
[53:28] David the great warrior he said he
[53:29] knowed where he was standing he was a
[53:31] man of Faith he believed God God was in
[53:34] him he knew he was anointed and you know
[53:36] the same thing if you're Christians amen
[53:39] if God hadn't elected you to be a
[53:41] Christian then you would not be a
[53:43] Christian see it's God's choice not
[53:45] yours no man seeks God Amen at any time
[53:48] you haven't sought God but God has
[53:51] sought you it wasn't you calling for God
[53:55] Amen it was God calling for you then
[53:57] when God called you it showed he elected
[53:59] you you accepted the call it was
[54:02] justification then you gave your heart
[54:04] to Christ and was filled with the Holy
[54:07] Spirit and now you're positionally
[54:09] placed in the body of Christ now if it
[54:11] made you quit your old mean habits and
[54:14] act like a Christian ought to it'll do
[54:16] that for you it'll heal your body amen
[54:19] because it is a promise that a Christian
[54:22] is not somebody amen that just shows up
[54:24] when they want to amen a Christian is
[54:26] not somebody that just believes amen
[54:29] when it is convenient to believe amen
[54:31] but a Christian is a son or daughter of
[54:33] God that was chosen by God by the
[54:36] election of God and positionally placed
[54:39] in the body of God Amen and the spirit
[54:42] on the inside of them amen is a direct
[54:45] reflection amen of what God was in Jesus
[54:48] is what he is in this bride all that was
[54:51] in God he poured into Christ and all
[54:54] that was in Christ he poured into you
[54:57] I'm just going to preach here for a
[54:58] moment I believe amen that outside of
[55:00] the message of the hour there's no way
[55:03] to be a real
[55:05] Christian now there's a lot of claim in
[55:07] the denominational Christians but if
[55:09] you're going to be a real Christian
[55:10] you're going to have to come in line
[55:12] with the word of the hour and the age
[55:14] you're living in but said in the Rapture
[55:16] he said if your life did not always was
[55:18] an attribute in God Amen then you are
[55:21] just a mimic of Christianity can I ask
[55:24] you something amen why would we want to
[55:26] Rob the Church of the beautiful
[55:27] teachings of predestination and the
[55:29] election of God and the forn knowledge
[55:31] of God Amen when a prophet said without
[55:33] that amen you're just a mimic of
[55:35] Christianity he said there'll be
[55:37] millions and billions of them amen
[55:40] they'll just be mimics of Christianity
[55:42] listen without a seed in your soul amen
[55:45] from before the foundation of the world
[55:47] you will stand in this age as a mimic of
[55:50] the word as a mimic of God but if there
[55:53] is a seed Gene of God on the inside of
[55:55] your soul was placed there by God Amen
[55:58] then when the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[56:00] begins to Quicken that seed it will move
[56:02] you from just being a church member into
[56:05] being a li living image of the Lord
[56:07] Jesus Christ now without that you'll
[56:10] just be a mimic of Christianity in Mark
[56:12] 77 Jesus said how be it in vain do they
[56:15] worship
[56:16] me what are they doing teaching for
[56:19] doctrines the Commandments of men
[56:22] Jeremiah 17:10 he said I the Lord search
[56:25] the heart I tribe the Reigns even to
[56:28] give every man according to his own ways
[56:31] according to the fruit of his doings now
[56:33] brother picks this up in the church age
[56:35] book and says now why does God call
[56:37] these churches his churches even though
[56:40] they are of the false Vine he said the
[56:42] truth of the matter is they are
[56:45] Christians but they're not Christians of
[56:48] the spirit they are Christians of the
[56:51] flesh see they are bearing the name in
[56:53] vain Mark 7:7 but in indeed they are
[56:56] Christians for what else could they be
[56:58] amen as a muhammadan is a muhammadan
[57:01] that is his religion no matter how he
[57:03] lives because he subscribes in theory to
[57:06] what the Quran teaches now in the same
[57:09] way a Christian is a Christian as long
[57:11] as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus
[57:14] is the son of God he is born of a virgin
[57:17] he was crucified died and rose again
[57:19] that he is the savior of mankind in fact
[57:21] in the layout of age there will be those
[57:24] who call themselves Christians but
[57:26] because they subscribe to the Fine
[57:28] qualities of Jesus while reserving to
[57:31] themselves the right Amen to deny his
[57:33] deity that is a mimic of Christianity
[57:36] they subscribed to the fact he was born
[57:38] of a virgin he lived a 33 and a half
[57:41] years he hung on the cross he died he
[57:43] was buried he rose again amen but they
[57:45] deny the deity of the return of the
[57:48] power of the Resurrection he said see a
[57:51] Christian Scientist has already done
[57:52] that as well as multitudes who preach a
[57:55] social gospel he is a nominal Christian
[57:58] and belongs to the church but he is not
[58:00] a true or spiritual believer that kind
[58:03] of believer is one who has been baptized
[58:05] in the body of Christ and is a member of
[58:08] him amen but nonetheless it is in God's
[58:11] order that the tears grow up with the
[58:13] wheat and they are not to be approved
[58:15] that is the command of God for their day
[58:18] for binding and burning is coming but it
[58:20] is not yet so the spirit is speaking to
[58:23] this mixed group on the one hand he is
[58:25] praising on the other hand he is
[58:27] rebuking he has told what is right with
[58:30] a True Believer now he warns the false
[58:32] Vine must do to stand Justified before
[58:35] the Lord amen let me say this we were
[58:38] all born Amen in sin shape and
[58:42] iniquity and come in the world speaking
[58:45] lies amen I'll say this I believe that
[58:47] there is a new birth that has been given
[58:50] by the grace of God Amen to break the
[58:52] birth of your Earthly father and mother
[58:55] amen the cursing and the seed jeans all
[58:57] those things that gathered into your
[58:59] life amen I believe there is a new birth
[59:02] according to John 3 amen and the only
[59:04] the ones who will come to that amen are
[59:06] the elected he said Marvel not that I
[59:09] said to thee ye must be born again picks
[59:12] this up in the church age book and says
[59:13] now then here we are coming to a
[59:15] conclusion amen as the Eternal lust God
[59:18] was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus
[59:21] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[59:22] bodily that Eternal one was the father
[59:25] manifest in flesh
[59:26] and thereby gain the title of son even
[59:29] so we Eternal in his thoughts in our
[59:32] turn somebody say our turn Amen in our
[59:35] turn amen became the many membered
[59:38] spoken word seed manifested in flesh and
[59:41] those Eternal thoughts are now made
[59:43] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[59:46] Amen even as we are so called so can I
[59:49] say this Paul had his turn and Peter had
[59:52] his turn Amen brother brandham had his
[59:54] turn amen but Young people this is your
[59:57] turn Amen to manifest God Amen in your
[1:00:00] age by the promise of the seed that was
[1:00:03] deposited in your soul from before the
[1:00:06] foundation of the world I love how the
[1:00:08] prophet says this aen it it breaks a lot
[1:00:10] of confusion just to say what he said we
[1:00:12] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:00:15] were seed and therefore were reborn amen
[1:00:18] for only the elect can be reborn because
[1:00:21] we were seed amen is the reason we could
[1:00:24] be quickened amen because in nonseed
[1:00:26] there is nothing to
[1:00:29] Quicken now I'll say this when Christ
[1:00:31] comes All Things become new that's why
[1:00:33] it's called the New Birth when Christ
[1:00:35] comes All Things become new see then
[1:00:38] what happens is is the image of Christ
[1:00:41] amen is birthed from the inside Amen to
[1:00:44] the outside see we're not cleaning a
[1:00:46] fish and then catching it but we catch a
[1:00:49] fish and then we clean it are you
[1:00:51] hearing me so it's not about cleaning up
[1:00:53] the outside and leaving the inside
[1:00:56] filthy but if you get the inside cleaned
[1:00:58] up by the new birth amen what is on the
[1:01:01] inside will move to the outside amen and
[1:01:04] will separate you from a mimic of
[1:01:06] Christianity and make you a real
[1:01:08] Christian in 2 Corinthians 5:17 Paul
[1:01:10] said If any man be in Christ amen he is
[1:01:14] a new creature old things are passed
[1:01:16] away and behold all things are become
[1:01:19] new brother said this cleans you inside
[1:01:21] and outside see it makes you a new
[1:01:23] creature yeah in Christ Jesus amen as
[1:01:29] the Greek puts it a new creation Now can
[1:01:32] I say this to you amen you are not an
[1:01:35] old creation amen patched up you are a
[1:01:39] new creation by the life of Jesus Christ
[1:01:42] coming on the inside of you say when the
[1:01:45] church lays dead for so long when your
[1:01:47] church don't have a Revival when the
[1:01:48] pastor just stands with a cold cut slide
[1:01:50] sermon when somebody says amen and
[1:01:52] everybody wants the deacons to take him
[1:01:54] out of the building when you get a
[1:01:55] Church like that it will lay dormant
[1:01:58] when you get a church like that it will
[1:02:00] lay dormant he said then oh let God send
[1:02:03] his man in their wants and watch what
[1:02:04] will take place amen the Revival fires
[1:02:07] will come back on the altar again people
[1:02:10] will be crying out for Mercy to their
[1:02:11] souls lives will be straightened up
[1:02:13] healings will take place in the church
[1:02:15] signs and wonders will begin to happen
[1:02:17] for where the Creator God is amen New
[1:02:21] Creation comes New Life comes New Hope
[1:02:24] comes every anything comes when Jesus
[1:02:27] comes always been so when Jesus comes he
[1:02:31] brings new life when Jesus comes he
[1:02:34] brings New Hope when Jesus comes he
[1:02:36] brings new faith when Jesus comes he
[1:02:38] brings the supernatural when Jesus comes
[1:02:42] he brings the fire amen back on the
[1:02:44] altar amen as a place of cleansing I'll
[1:02:47] say this the new birth is more than a
[1:02:48] Doctrine the new birth is more than an
[1:02:50] idea amen but the new birth amen is a
[1:02:53] paradox amen where God take makes you
[1:02:56] yourself and changes you from death into
[1:02:59] life and out of your innermost being is
[1:03:01] a new creation in Christ Jesus it is a
[1:03:07] paradox now God Amen prepares his
[1:03:10] servants by fire you look in the Bible
[1:03:12] in Isaiah 6 when you get time read it
[1:03:14] sometime you will see that the Bible
[1:03:16] says amen that Isaiah amen said that a
[1:03:19] Col of fire amen touch the prophet I
[1:03:22] want you to catch something here amen
[1:03:24] what changed him from a man that was
[1:03:26] undone and of unclean lips to a prepared
[1:03:29] servant with a commission saying amen
[1:03:31] here am I Lord send me amen it wasn't
[1:03:34] intellectualism it wasn't a bunch of
[1:03:36] teachings and a bunch of books and a
[1:03:38] bunch of Creeds and a bunch of declarate
[1:03:40] come on Church what changed Isaiah from
[1:03:42] being an undone man with unclean lips
[1:03:45] was when the fire of God come back on
[1:03:48] the Altar and touched his lips amen now
[1:03:50] let me say this I believe that our God
[1:03:53] according to Hebrews 12 amen is a
[1:03:55] consuming fire and I tell you what the
[1:03:57] church needs amen it's the fire of God
[1:04:00] to come back in the church now come on I
[1:04:02] might as well preach I'm here we're
[1:04:04] trying to fix all kinds of situations
[1:04:06] amen but let the fire come one time
[1:04:08] we're trying to cancel this and fix that
[1:04:11] put this back together amen but let the
[1:04:13] fire of God come in the church amen well
[1:04:15] our wayward loved
[1:04:17] ones come on our loved ones are wward
[1:04:20] and our babies are growing cold you know
[1:04:22] why they're growing cold is cuz the fire

[1:04:33] got to join this and go to this seminar
[1:04:35] and go to this class and then know what
[1:04:36] we need to do is preach the fire of God
[1:04:39] until it makes every icicle so
[1:04:41] uncomfortable that it melts in the
[1:04:43] presence of the Holy Ghost and the fire
[1:04:45] of God breaks out in the church again
[1:04:47] amen I still believe in the fire of God
[1:04:49] I believe we ought to let the fire of
[1:04:50] God consume our singing We ought Let the
[1:04:53] Fire of God consume our musicians we
[1:04:55] ought to let the fire of God consume the
[1:04:57] puppy amen how many say Lord open the

[1:09:04] Colossians 1: 126 even the mystery which
[1:09:06] have been hid from ages and from
[1:09:07] Generations but now is made manifest to
[1:09:10] the Saints to whom God will make known
[1:09:12] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:09:14] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:09:17] Christ in you the hope of glory now you

[1:09:36] will be that he will take preeminence of
[1:09:38] his body amen by the revelation of
[1:09:41] himself amen now the third fold is he

[1:10:10] person amen of the word himself Amen to

[1:10:44] of Christ now what was once God's Great
[1:10:46] Secret in his mind before the foundation
[1:10:50] of the world is now made manifest can I
[1:10:53] say this what was once in God 's mind is
[1:10:56] now in God's
[1:10:58] Church what was once in God's mind I'm
[1:11:01] now looking at the image of what was in
[1:11:03] his mind now reflected in his church
[1:11:06] Christ life in you makes him the center
[1:11:10] of the Revelation Christ in you makes
[1:11:12] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:11:15] thing see then what is the new birth you
[1:11:17] say well brother BR what is the new
[1:11:18] birth it's the
[1:11:21] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:11:25] you
[1:11:25] see not you joined the church you shook
[1:11:28] a hand you done something different you
[1:11:30] said a Creed you promised live by code
[1:11:31] of rules no but Christ the Bible he is
[1:11:35] the word was revealed to you now what is
[1:11:37] it it's Christ being revealed and he is
[1:11:40] the word now watch when the word is
[1:11:43] revealed amen it expresses itself so
[1:11:46] when the word is revealed amen the
[1:11:49] revealed word becomes an expression of
[1:11:51] God and the prophet said Christ God died
[1:11:54] in flesh in order order to condemn sin
[1:11:56] in the flesh that he might bring himself
[1:11:58] a glorious bride redeemed
[1:12:01] back that will believe only in the word
[1:12:03] of God and not swap it like he did for
[1:12:06] intellectual conceptions of man if a man
[1:12:08] says he's born again and tries to place
[1:12:11] these promises of Christ in the last
[1:12:13] days to some other age making him Christ
[1:12:16] yesterday but not today then that man or
[1:12:19] that person has been in a delusion by
[1:12:22] Satan let me say this I believe in mark
[1:12:25] I believe that there will be a Mark 16
[1:12:27] church that will lay hands on the sick
[1:12:29] and they shall recover I believe there
[1:12:31] will be a Mark 16 church amen they will
[1:12:34] not try to psychology Devils out they
[1:12:36] will cast them Devils out I believe
[1:12:38] there will be a church that will March
[1:12:40] in the anointing and the same
[1:12:42] inspiration amen that Jesus breathed out
[1:12:44] upon the church when he said go ye in
[1:12:46] all the world and preach the gospel amen
[1:12:49] and baptize in my name repentance of
[1:12:52] sins come on church amen and the sick
[1:12:54] will be healed the dead will be raised
[1:12:56] demons will be cast out I believe that
[1:12:59] you are the reflection of that scripture
[1:13:02] in flesh in this generation I believe it
[1:13:05] amen I don't believe I'm just reading
[1:13:07] Mark 16 I believe you are the living
[1:13:09] image of Mark 16 I don't believe I'm
[1:13:12] just reading acts two I believe somebody
[1:13:14] has been baptized in the name of the
[1:13:16] Lord Jesus Christ and they are the
[1:13:19] Living
[1:13:22] Image come on sometime or another it's
[1:13:24] got to get off of letter form and get in
[1:13:25] the flesh form come on sometime or
[1:13:28] another it's got to be more than Sunday
[1:13:30] morning and Sunday afternoon and
[1:13:32] Wednesday night in
[1:13:33] a in a youth camp somewhere somewhere or
[1:13:37] another you got to become amen the
[1:13:39] transformed son or daughter of God
[1:13:41] manifesting God in the power of His word
[1:13:44] in the age you're living in amen I
[1:13:46] believe it I don't believe it's a
[1:13:47] possibility I believe it's a
[1:13:49] promise I don't believe it's they might
[1:13:52] they perhaps they shall amen amen can I
[1:13:57] say it the way brother said it they will
[1:13:59] amen well Glory they not might they not
[1:14:03] perhaps they will see heavens and earth
[1:14:05] will pass away but his word won't now in
[1:14:09] Acts 24:14 I love the Bible it says this
[1:14:12] I confess unto thee that after the way
[1:14:14] which they call heresy amen so worship I
[1:14:17] the god of my fathers I want you to
[1:14:19] catch this here believing all things
[1:14:23] yeah that's right as they call this way
[1:14:25] the way of heresy but it's the way that
[1:14:28] I worship the god of my fathers amen now
[1:14:30] watch this believe in all
[1:14:33] things which are written in the law and
[1:14:37] in the prophets now brother Bob you've
[1:14:39] been around long enough to know am mean
[1:14:41] you're getting a good hot meat you know
[1:14:42] and the Holy Ghost gets to move and amen
[1:14:44] people get to dancing and shout and
[1:14:46] rejoice and having a good time amen
[1:14:47] somebody going to stand up and say well
[1:14:49] glory to God in the way they call heresy
[1:14:52] is the way we worship the god of our
[1:14:54] fathers you know and but let me say this
[1:14:56] that is not just pertaining to an
[1:14:58] emotional demonstration of worship come
[1:15:01] onen it's not the way of heresy was not
[1:15:04] just because somebody got lost in the
[1:15:05] Holy Ghost and shouted or they got lost
[1:15:07] in the Holy Ghost and danced but the the
[1:15:09] way of heresy was that there was some
[1:15:12] people in there that they didn't believe
[1:15:14] some things the prophet said they didn't
[1:15:16] believe a few things the law said but
[1:15:18] everything that was in the law and
[1:15:20] everything that was spoken by the
[1:15:22] prophet amen they stood on it amen come
[1:15:25] H or high water they stood on it amen
[1:15:27] because they were Christians they were
[1:15:29] living images of God and I believe in
[1:15:31] this generation God is raising up a
[1:15:33] group of young people that are going to
[1:15:35] be identified as Heretics but they're
[1:15:37] not going to back off of this message
[1:15:39] they're not going to back off of what a
[1:15:40] prophet T if they got to stand by
[1:15:43] themselves they're going to stand by
[1:15:44] themselves because there is a power amen
[1:15:47] a transforming power Hallelujah and then
[1:15:50] there's a transforming power in saying
[1:15:52] what a prophet said people say the
[1:15:54] people czy listen the reason they say
[1:15:56] that is because they haven't got the
[1:15:59] mind of the world anymore they have got
[1:16:01] the mind of
[1:16:03] Christ so if you're going to fall in the
[1:16:05] way of heresy come on
[1:16:07] now you're going to have to lose the
[1:16:10] mind of the world and you're going to
[1:16:12] have to take on the mind of Christ in
[1:16:14] other words you're going to have to
[1:16:15] agree with things that your own flesh
[1:16:18] don't
[1:16:21] amen that's right you're going to have
[1:16:23] to agree with a prophet when the world
[1:16:26] says it's old
[1:16:27] fashion come on now we might as well
[1:16:29] preach we here well well brother Andrew
[1:16:31] I agree with but I don't go along with
[1:16:33] that part about wearing shorts you know
[1:16:35] that was his opinion well you're not in
[1:16:37] the way of heresy then that's right
[1:16:40] that's right Welly to
[1:16:42] God preacher you're doing good well
[1:16:45] brother Andrew we we believe brother
[1:16:46] brand but that part about televisions
[1:16:48] you know I mean that was back in the 50s
[1:16:50] and and you know what was on there then
[1:16:51] you know I love Lucian well dear God
[1:16:54] what's on there now
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:57] brother so either you're going to stand
[1:16:59] with the word and manifest the image of
[1:17:02] God or you're going to back off
[1:17:04] somewhere and say well we'll take the
[1:17:05] mind of the world Listen amen amen a
[1:17:08] double minded mind a double-minded man
[1:17:10] is unstable in all his ways so if you
[1:17:12] got the mind of the world on this
[1:17:14] subject and the mind of Christ on that
[1:17:16] one you are a double-minded individual
[1:17:18] but either you're going to have all the
[1:17:20] mind of the world or all the mind of
[1:17:22] Christ but I believe there's some real
[1:17:24] Christians here
[1:17:25] and are going to die to the things of
[1:17:26] Leia they're going to die to the
[1:17:28] traditions of this world and they're
[1:17:30] going to say call me crazy call me a
[1:17:32] Holy Roller call me oldfashioned but I'm
[1:17:35] going to stand with a Vindicated word of
[1:17:38] God in the age I'm living in you got the
[1:17:40] mind of the world or the mind of Christ
[1:17:42] see Christ in you the hope of glory can
[1:17:44] I say this we are transformed into the
[1:17:47] image of God Amen according to Romans 12
[1:17:50] by the renewing of our mind now I'll say
[1:17:53] this to you there's two mind Minds in
[1:17:55] the world today there's the mind of
[1:17:57] Christ somebody say the mind of
[1:17:59] Christ and the mind of the world says in
[1:18:02] Witnesses 1954 cause remember you can't
[1:18:06] have the mind of Christ and the mind of
[1:18:09] the world at the same
[1:18:11] time my goodness you can't have the mind
[1:18:15] of Christ and the mind of the world at
[1:18:17] the same time you can't be in your way
[1:18:20] and God's way at the same time amen you
[1:18:23] have to get out of your way way to let
[1:18:26] God have his way that's the only way
[1:18:28] you're ever going to do anything is you
[1:18:30] got to get away from your own thoughts
[1:18:33] I'm preaching to you if you're going to
[1:18:35] be a real Christian you got to get away
[1:18:37] from your own thoughts your own reason
[1:18:39] see don't try to reason just believe
[1:18:42] amen listen if you're going to be a
[1:18:44] mimic of Christianity then take the mind
[1:18:46] of the world on this and the mind of
[1:18:48] Christ on that and the reason on this
[1:18:50] and you're but but if you're going to be
[1:18:51] a real living image of Christ amen
[1:18:54] crucify the mind of the world and let
[1:18:56] the mind of Christ drop into you by the
[1:18:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll say this
[1:19:01] to you the mind of the world is carnal
[1:19:04] amen the mind of the world is carnal but
[1:19:08] the mind of Christ is spiritual am now
[1:19:10] Romans 8:6 says to be carnally minded is
[1:19:13] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:19:16] life and peace because the carnal mind
[1:19:19] amen is enmity against God for it is not
[1:19:21] subject to the law of God Amen neither
[1:19:24] indeed can be
[1:19:25] you all heard the saying amen so
[1:19:27] Heavenly minded no earthly good you've
[1:19:30] heard that saying but you know I've
[1:19:32] actually come to realize more and more
[1:19:34] that that's more than just something to
[1:19:35] joke to say that that's more than just a
[1:19:38] little a little uh negative something to
[1:19:40] put on somebody amen if you're becoming
[1:19:43] more Heavenly minded that you're no
[1:19:44] earthly good amen you're becoming in a
[1:19:46] blessed position right amen amen because
[1:19:49] the way this world is going is crazy
[1:19:52] come on church we we we got B boys going
[1:19:55] in girls' bathrooms thinking they girls
[1:19:57] we got kids going to school thinking
[1:19:59] their
[1:20:00] cats well we might as well preach amen
[1:20:02] we got we got boys marrying boys and
[1:20:04] girls becoming boys and amen wake up one
[1:20:07] day they feel like a boy wake up the
[1:20:09] next day they feel like a girl wake up
[1:20:11] the next day they feel like a dog go to
[1:20:12] school they feel like a cat come home
[1:20:14] they feel like a are you hearing me we
[1:20:17] don't no longer say he or she we say
[1:20:19] they or them or well we might as well
[1:20:21] preach amen the world has lost their
[1:20:24] mind because the lid has come off of
[1:20:26] hell and demon powers have invaded this
[1:20:29] generation but thank God in the last
[1:20:31] days there would be a restoration of the
[1:20:33] faith of God that would turn the hearts
[1:20:36] back to the faith of the fathers and
[1:20:38] somebody would rise up and say I'm not
[1:20:40] going that way and I'm not going that
[1:20:42] way and I'm not going that way I'm going
[1:20:44] the way of the word I'm going the way of
[1:20:47] the truth the life and that way see but
[1:20:50] you got to lose the carnal mind and take
[1:20:53] on the spiritual mind amen yes yes
[1:20:57] Romans 8:7 because the carnal mind is
[1:21:00] enmity against God that word enmity is
[1:21:03] the state or feeling of being actively
[1:21:05] opposed or hostile to someone or
[1:21:08] something another word for enmity is
[1:21:11] hatred which is used in the book of
[1:21:13] Galatians remember said look how true
[1:21:15] the devil was he fooled every priest
[1:21:17] that come on the earth he sure did he's
[1:21:19] still doing it see he was smart but he'd
[1:21:22] come up against a match one day who
[1:21:23] defeated him yes and the only thing we
[1:21:26] have to do is just lay against him he's
[1:21:29] already defeated him but it is from Ben
[1:21:32] speaking of wisdom this wisdom that man
[1:21:34] can accumulate to prove and show all
[1:21:36] these things why a man should do this
[1:21:38] and man should do that is contrary and
[1:21:41] enmity the carnal mind to God the
[1:21:43] scripture said so right no matter how
[1:21:45] smart they can twist it around I want
[1:21:47] somebody to show me where God ever had
[1:21:50] an
[1:21:52] organization or ever commanded one but
[1:21:54] what condemns it here in the Bible no
[1:21:56] matter how smart they can try to be it's
[1:21:58] contrary how the wisdom can it stand and
[1:22:01] out argue to you and make you feel
[1:22:02] little by little by telling you about it
[1:22:05] but see it's contrary to the scriptures
[1:22:09] now brother BR preaches a beautiful
[1:22:10] sermon I encourage you Amen to listen to
[1:22:12] it when you get time he calls it the
[1:22:14] images of
[1:22:16] Christ and he takes it he actually takes
[1:22:19] his uh his text from the B from The Book
[1:22:21] of John 13 and he reads it from where we
[1:22:24] read on foot Washing Service right he
[1:22:26] said now look know ye not what I've done
[1:22:28] unto you now wash this their feet he
[1:22:30] taken his garments was set down against
[1:22:31] them know you not what I've done to you
[1:22:33] verse 13 you call me master and Lord and
[1:22:36] you say well for so I am if I then your
[1:22:40] Lord and Master have washed your feet
[1:22:42] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:22:44] feet now do you all remember amen how
[1:22:47] the Bible said that when he said that
[1:22:48] Peter said Lord we ain't going that way
[1:22:51] you know what happened was was Peter
[1:22:54] Still had amen a carnal view of what
[1:22:57] Jesus was saying am but Jesus said amen
[1:23:00] if your lord Master have washed your
[1:23:01] feet also wash one anothers for I've
[1:23:03] given you an example that you should do
[1:23:05] as I've done unto you verily I say unto
[1:23:07] you the servant is not greater than his
[1:23:10] Lord neither he that is sent greater
[1:23:12] than he that sent him if you know these
[1:23:14] things amen happy if you do
[1:23:17] themen now that word example means a
[1:23:20] pattern it is a sign it is suggestive of
[1:23:23] anything amen it is a copy for imitation
[1:23:27] of the thing to be imitated or of the
[1:23:29] thing to be shunned so when something is
[1:23:31] set as an example it's either to be
[1:23:34] copied Amen to be imitated to be a pre
[1:23:37] to be a to be a rep uh A reproduction of
[1:23:40] it rather or it's to be shunned now let
[1:23:42] me say this the pro God said our text
[1:23:45] tonight reflects what he was amen that's
[1:23:47] what makes him great in my estimation
[1:23:50] yet being the very God of Eternity the
[1:23:52] very God that created the heavens and
[1:23:53] the earth when he came here he took the
[1:23:55] lowest position the most dis desirable
[1:23:57] job that anybody could have that was a
[1:23:59] footwash flunky of all the Pains of the
[1:24:02] early days in the in the Oriental world
[1:24:04] the footwash funky amen was the lowest
[1:24:07] paid man of all for in these days
[1:24:09] animals walked on the highways had
[1:24:11] little byways that went by along the
[1:24:13] road amen it stunk all along the road
[1:24:15] where the animals were that dust f up
[1:24:17] got on their legs and in their feet and
[1:24:18] such an awful stink as there was and as
[1:24:20] soon as someone come to visit another he
[1:24:23] could not come in that manner he smelled
[1:24:25] bad from the stink of the Rob and the
[1:24:27] dust like around the liary stable so the
[1:24:29] first thing he did was he had a little
[1:24:31] reception booth and the lowest paid man
[1:24:34] on the place just like some slav stayed
[1:24:36] back in there to wash the feet of this
[1:24:38] guest that was coming and give him
[1:24:40] another pair of shoes to put on little
[1:24:41] sandals and slip on him when he was
[1:24:43] anointed now when the O could go to the
[1:24:45] great of all of his friend CU he'd fell
[1:24:48] out of place going in full going in so
[1:24:50] full the stink of the roads and sweaty
[1:24:51] and so forth and the footwash Funky was
[1:24:53] paid l less than any man that there
[1:24:56] was now now you got a a picture of the
[1:24:59] footwash and the god of Heaven
[1:25:02] humbled himself the greatest there was
[1:25:05] became the lowest there was he said now
[1:25:08] what a difference of the socalled
[1:25:10] reflecting Christian today what a
[1:25:12] difference see why the so-called
[1:25:14] Christian today wants to be served so
[1:25:17] the the the so-called Christian wants to
[1:25:19] be served oh he began to think that's he
[1:25:21] somebody what difference was it from
[1:25:23] what was reflecting him see he never
[1:25:25] come to be ministered to but he come to
[1:25:28] minister he said let he that's the
[1:25:30] greatest among you be the servant of
[1:25:31] them all and we see today our Modern
[1:25:33] Trend of Christianity is is I'm somebody
[1:25:35] and you're nothing it's wrong it should
[1:25:37] not be that way we are trying to reflect
[1:25:41] Christianity in the wrong way God
[1:25:43] doesn't want us to do it that way we
[1:25:44] sing the song to be like Jesus but when
[1:25:47] it comes to Humble our pride and to get
[1:25:49] down like he did then we draw a line and
[1:25:52] in doing so man has formed denominations
[1:25:55] that they can separate themselves
[1:25:57] seemingly not having the spirit as the
[1:25:59] scripture says they separate themselves
[1:26:01] we belong to this church it's a bigger
[1:26:03] church or better church denomination
[1:26:05] greater that doesn't act like Jesus that
[1:26:08] doesn't reflect his love and his
[1:26:09] personality he came to the lowest amen
[1:26:13] are you hearing me he came to the lowest
[1:26:17] to the street harlet to the beggar to
[1:26:19] the bum and got right down in the dust
[1:26:21] with him that's the Christian Life
[1:26:23] That's the way it should be to reflect
[1:26:26] him in that way so a real Christian has
[1:26:29] been born again by the water the blood
[1:26:31] and the spirit amen now listen they
[1:26:33] didn't try to come to God on their own
[1:26:35] terms but they laid aside their terms
[1:26:38] they laid aside the mind of the world
[1:26:40] and took on the mind of Christ and said
[1:26:42] if it's snotting at an altar that's what
[1:26:44] I'll go if it's crying out at an altar
[1:26:46] that's what I'll do come on we might as
[1:26:48] well preach we here I think we got a
[1:26:49] little too dignified and sophisticated
[1:26:52] Amen in our way we're bringing people to
[1:26:55] God I might as well preach amen we made
[1:26:58] this way and that way listen we used to
[1:26:59] get up knock the Baptist for sh for for

[1:27:46] to the power of the Holy Ghost listen
[1:27:49] I'm not here to be a reflection for
[1:27:51] intellectualism I'm not here to be a
[1:27:53] reflection for the things of Le out of
[1:27:54] seea my purpose on this Earth your
[1:27:57] purpose on this Earth is to be a channel
[1:28:00] that God can reflect himself through not
[1:28:02] as a god of wood not as a god of stone
[1:28:05] but as a living
[1:28:06] God a Living Image our God is not dead
[1:28:11] he's alive and
[1:28:15] well man he humbled himself now y y'all
[1:28:18] know I think it's amazing brother said
[1:28:20] the position they give the footwash
[1:28:21] flunky was a slave yeah right right the
[1:28:25] position they put the footwash funky in
[1:28:28] was considered a slave and Jesus took
[1:28:31] that
[1:28:32] position
[1:28:34] yenen come on yeah yes and the Bible
[1:28:39] also says there was little woman that
[1:28:40] come
[1:28:41] in and she had an alabaster box and she
[1:28:46] found her way over to where Jesus was
[1:28:48] and she knelt down and washed his oh God
[1:28:52] washed his feet with her tears amen and
[1:28:56] dried them with her
[1:28:59] hair are you hearing me she was a slave
[1:29:02] to the sin of the world she was a slave
[1:29:05] to perversion but there was a man there
[1:29:08] that could take her sin and give her his
[1:29:12] righteousness what did he do how did he
[1:29:14] do that he didn't do that as one being
[1:29:16] served he did that as a servant who
[1:29:19] being in the form of God thought it not
[1:29:20] Roby to be equal with God but made
[1:29:22] himself of no reput ation and took upon
[1:29:26] him the form of a servant and was made
[1:29:29] in the likeness of men look at this word
[1:29:32] servant it is one who gives himself up
[1:29:35] to another's will amen yes amen so a
[1:29:39] real Christian oh God is someone who
[1:29:43] gives thems up to another's will those
[1:29:47] whose service is used by Christ in
[1:29:49] extending and advancing his cause among
[1:29:52] men listen devoted to another to the
[1:29:55] disregard of One's Own interest as a
[1:29:58] servant yes yes amen that's it so if
[1:30:02] you're going to be a real Christian
[1:30:04] you're going to have to give yourself up
[1:30:06] to another's will right amen amen that's
[1:30:09] right are you with me and you're going
[1:30:11] to have to disregard your own interest
[1:30:14] as a servant now let me say what a
[1:30:16] prophet said today they try to bypass
[1:30:17] the new birth because the new birth is a
[1:30:19] mess y that's right that's right but it
[1:30:21] produces life yeah amen right come on do
[1:30:24] we want a mess or do we want life right
[1:30:26] well we want the mess that produces life
[1:30:29] what kind of life he says servant life
[1:30:32] yeah right yes so the son of man didn't
[1:30:35] come to be ministered to but he came to
[1:30:38] minister to said what is a birth if a
[1:30:40] birth happens on a straw tick or it
[1:30:42] happens on the floor in a hospital that
[1:30:44] rooms are decorated pink silk it's a
[1:30:46] mess any way you take it and so is the
[1:30:49] new birth it's a mess but it produces
[1:30:52] life what kind of life
[1:30:54] servant life to humble yourself to deny
[1:30:57] yourself that's the kind of Life Jesus
[1:30:59] said this is my commandment that you
[1:31:01] love one another as I've loved you he
[1:31:03] said these things I command you that you
[1:31:05] love one another now watch what a
[1:31:07] prophet says oh they say but I seen them
[1:31:09] crying and boohoo around the Altar and
[1:31:11] carrying on sure they're being born it's
[1:31:13] a mess I don't care where you go you
[1:31:15] might get your face full of tears and
[1:31:17] your eyes red and your hands raw from
[1:31:20] beating on the altar but it is a birth
[1:31:23] yes amen amen it's a birth see it does
[1:31:27] something to you God have mercy it does
[1:31:30] something to you it makes you a servant
[1:31:33] are you ready for this it takes the
[1:31:34] starch out of you well glory to God I
[1:31:38] might as well preach on that point cuz I
[1:31:39] felt it amen I think it's time to get
[1:31:41] the starch out you know what starch is
[1:31:44] amen you put starching something when
[1:31:46] you want to hold in a specific position
[1:31:48] for a very long time and you know what I
[1:31:50] think we've done I think we've starched
[1:31:52] up our praise long enough I think we've
[1:31:54] starched up our worship long enough I
[1:31:56] think it's time to get back at the altar
[1:31:58] and let the fire of God melt out all the
[1:32:00] starch until there's a boohoo amen well
[1:32:04] I feel like praising him are you hearing
[1:32:07] me let all the starch go and let some
[1:32:10] flexibility come in
[1:32:13] there H Longoria told me one time he

[1:32:17] church on Sunday mornings as a kid he
[1:32:19] said cuz Mama put us in them starched

[1:44:07] of Christ amen you will be more than
[1:44:10] church members right you will be more
[1:44:13] than a part of the youth group y right
[1:44:15] you will be more than just singers in
[1:44:17] the choir or musicians on the platform
[1:44:20] you will be true spirit filled
[1:44:23] Christians amen Amen on and you will
[1:44:26] have the same somebody say the same The
[1:44:28] Same Spirit that was in Christ Amen
[1:44:31] brother B said now watch if Christ Still
[1:44:33] Remains Christ if his spirit is still
[1:44:34] the holy spirit that was in him be in
[1:44:36] you it'll make you take that position
[1:44:39] too right yes yes can I say this to you
[1:44:42] we're not here to bear his physical
[1:44:45] image we are here to bear his spiritual
[1:44:47] image I brother waade I've witnessed to
[1:44:49] people before guys had really long hair
[1:44:51] you know and you get to witnessing to to
[1:44:53] them and they say well I got this long
[1:44:54] hair CA Jesus did that makes me a
[1:44:56] Christian you know and and and you
[1:44:58] really think well but but what are you
[1:45:01] trying to get
[1:45:02] to what what are you what are you trying
[1:45:05] to satisfy with a thought that I've got
[1:45:07] long hair like Jesus did when brother B
[1:45:09] said it's not outwardly it's inwardly
[1:45:11] right said now that doesn't mean we have
[1:45:13] to grow a long beard as the artist

[1:45:25] somebody say we must in our souls our
[1:45:29] reflect his Spirit image and his manner
[1:45:31] of
[1:45:32] life I do not believe that Christians

[2:02:51] power he that overcometh will I give all
[2:02:55] these things amen you say I can't do it
[2:02:57] nope you're exactly right start right
[2:02:59] there you can't do it you can't do it
[2:03:02] but there's a God that can and there's
[2:03:04] Provisions there's there's there's
[2:03:06] people that can can preach the word like
[2:03:08] our brother did for us today that'll
[2:03:10] open up a window amen so that you can
[2:03:13] the devil can get out and you can and
[2:03:15] God can get in that's exactly what we
[2:03:17] want we want that unclean spirit I I
[2:03:19] said many times before I hope you're
[2:03:21] today you're as comfortable as you can
[2:03:23] be just like a just like sitting at home
[2:03:25] at my Mom and Daddy's house but I want
[2:03:27] the devil to be so uncomfortable till he
[2:03:29] leaves I want him to be uncomfortable I
[2:03:31] don't want him to be comfortable in this
[2:03:33] building I want him to be very
[2:03:34] uncomfortable and he will be when you
[2:03:36] start praising God and know the god that
[2:03:40] you're praising that's the whole thing
[2:03:42] know the god that you're praising when
[2:03:44] you know the god that you're praising
[2:03:45] that's the new birth cuz that's the only
[2:03:48] connection there is cuz your old birth
[2:03:49] pulled you away from it amen birth
[2:03:52] connected you right back to where you
[2:03:53] supposed to been had it not been a fall
[2:03:56] and that's God that's God that's not
[2:03:59] that's not another listen we're not
[2:04:01] another person amen we're God made
[2:04:03] manifest in another form called a bride

[2:04:08] are him thank God for a prophet that
[2:04:10] could say that she is him amen and mean
[2:04:13] it CU then we look in the Bible and we
[2:04:15] see that we're him we're supposed to

[2:04:46] she loved that devil so he cast it off
[2:04:48] God got it away from her but she wanted
[2:04:50] it so much till it came right back in
[2:04:53] the unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry
[2:04:55] places comes back finds it all clean and
[2:04:58] if you ain't got that door
[2:04:59] sealed he's going to come back in and
