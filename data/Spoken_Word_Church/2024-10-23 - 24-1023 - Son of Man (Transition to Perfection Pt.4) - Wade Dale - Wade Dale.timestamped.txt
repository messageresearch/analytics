[11:31] you love the
[11:32] Lord in the eyes of God every step you
[11:35] take is a step closer to your
[11:39] purpose God never saw anything negative
[11:43] oh he hears he he see things through
[11:45] different different Avenues but for us
[11:48] that Genesis 1 126 man is going to stay
[11:50] the way he thought of it cuz that's what
[11:52] we're heading back to and I appreciate
[11:54] the Lord for uh giving us Grace as
[11:56] sister was was singing there I
[11:58] appreciate the gra Grace that God give
[11:59] us to be able to get back to him and
[12:03] that we have a message of the hour that
[12:06] that Luther had a message of the hour
[12:09] Wesley had a message of the hour
[12:11] Pentecost had a message of the hour all
[12:13] down Through the Ages but they never had
[12:15] one that says this is the
[12:17] end this is it for the Gentiles this is
[12:19] the last Gentile dispensation there's
[12:21] nothing else left for us and if that
[12:24] doesn't make you happy then you need to
[12:27] get to the altar because we're heading
[12:29] towards something way better than this
[12:32] we're heading towards something way
[12:33] better than this world and whatever it
[12:35] has like somebody said the other day
[12:37] this no nobody's going to dig us
[12:40] out nobody's going to make us better on
[12:43] this world in this earth I thinking
[12:45] today you know you um you see all these
[12:49] relief efforts and you know every once
[12:50] in a while there'll be a scammer show up
[12:55] and scam somebody out of something amen
[12:58] feed them a scam
[13:00] sandwich right but I'll promise you Word
[13:03] of Life Church and Bible Believers in uh
[13:08] in
[13:08] Hickory that ain't going to
[13:11] happen they never saw a more perfect
[13:13] group of people than they now they may
[13:16] make human mistakes but I was thinking
[13:17] today there's always scammers you always
[13:19] hear people scamming people out of money
[13:21] those people will never in their life
[13:24] ever scam anybody out of
[13:27] anything that's what God does when he
[13:29] goes inside here he takes care of all
[13:32] that worldly stuff and US wanting to
[13:33] have an angle to get by with something
[13:37] they had a they had two groups of people
[13:39] up there that were just Angels taking
[13:41] care of people that were humans and
[13:43] they're still taking care of them and
[13:44] still still U um regretfully finding
[13:48] bodies and and all that but just just
[13:50] keep them in prayer and uh ask a
[13:52] blessing on on the efforts that they're
[13:55] doing so let's bow our heads dear

[16:30] Revelations
[16:31] 3:14 thank you
[16:34] Josh Revelation 3:14 unto the angel the
[16:37] Church of the L ofan right these things
[16:39] sayith the amen the faithful and true
[16:40] witness the beginning of the creation of
[16:42] God I Know Thy works that there are
[16:44] neither cold or hot I would thou were
[16:46] cold or hot God wants us to be one of
[16:49] the
[16:49] other he does not want us to be wishy
[16:52] washy right in the middle
[16:54] lukewarm willy-nilly all that stuff he
[16:58] wants us to be one of the two he wishes
[17:00] that we were one of the two all right so
[17:03] then because they lukew because what
[17:05] lukew says well I'm fine I'm lukewarm
[17:07] I'm okay I'm not too hot I'm not too
[17:09] cold I'm comfortable like some of y'all
[17:11] in here today you're
[17:13] comfortable so then because Thou Art
[17:15] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[17:17] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[17:19] sayth I am rich and increased with goods
[17:21] and have need of nothing and as I said
[17:23] before 22 million millionaires just in
[17:26] the United States
[17:30] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[17:31] miserable poor blind and naked I counsel
[17:33] thee to buy me gold tried in the fire
[17:36] that thou mayest be rich what richness
[17:38] are we looking for we're not looking for
[17:40] the richness of the world we're looking
[17:42] for the richness that Jesus promised us
[17:45] to have even on this side right and
[17:48] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[17:50] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[17:51] appear and anoint thine eyes with isav
[17:54] that thou mayest see we're going to be
[17:57] the only group of people though that
[17:58] really see see who Jesus Christ is the
[18:00] world can't they can pick at it they can
[18:02] look at it it's like Paul they look
[18:03] through a glass Darkly they think they
[18:05] know who Jesus is they know he died on a
[18:08] cross or some do and then they can't get
[18:10] him in their heart though to where he
[18:12] can work his way back out behold I stand
[18:15] at the door as many as I love I rebuke
[18:17] and Chase and be zealous and repent
[18:19] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[18:21] any man hears my voice and opens the
[18:23] door I will come into him and will s
[18:25] with him and he with me to him that
[18:27] overcometh will I grant in other words
[18:29] God now to him that overcometh will I
[18:31] who's speaking here Jesus Christ
[18:34] remember he's one is speaking this is
[18:35] all in red letter he's speaking to John
[18:37] on the aisle of patmas hisself all right
[18:40] to him that overcometh will I grant that
[18:43] Grant is something he's going to give
[18:45] he's going to give us something it's a
[18:47] gift that he's going to give us and
[18:49] remember as we said many times before
[18:51] well a long time ago that this this age
[18:54] is the worst age there ever is Right
[18:56] ever has been but it's the most intimate
[18:59] age with Jesus Christ that ever has
[19:01] been hello cuz it we can sit in not on
[19:06] in none of the other ones now you can
[19:08] get you'll get a stone and you'll get a
[19:09] this and you'll be in the temple of God
[19:11] and you'll know this and you'll know
[19:13] that no where it so intimate is that
[19:15] we're going to overcome and we're going
[19:17] to be absolutely right there with him as
[19:20] we were speaking Sunday about she is him
[19:22] we know she is him and we get to sit on
[19:24] that throne but he's the one that sits
[19:26] now watch he's the one that sits where
[19:28] on my father's Throne so there we're all
[19:30] there together now we have the true
[19:33] Revelation to one God no one else does
[19:36] all right the true Revelation to one God
[19:38] you got Jesus only you got different
[19:39] ones but this is the and what is a
[19:41] throne a throne is a Dominion it shows
[19:43] that you have dominion over something so
[19:46] Jesus Christ he got dominion over the
[19:48] devil right it's going to make come to a
[19:50] realization we are that we are the same
[19:52] as she is him that we going to get the
[19:54] same thing body change and everything
[19:56] just like him so he that hit in ear let
[19:58] him hear what the spirit says to the
[19:59] churches you may be seated the Lord that
[20:01] His blessings of the reading of the word
[20:03] 1 Corinthians 13:8 says charity never
[20:05] faileth but whether there'll be
[20:07] prophecies they will fail you we're
[20:09] talking about this transition to
[20:11] Perfection whether there'll be tongues
[20:13] they will cease whether they be
[20:14] knowledge it'll vanish away for we know
[20:16] in part and we prophesy in part Paul
[20:19] being a prophet he could see things but
[20:20] he couldn't understand them brother Bram
[20:23] saw things that he didn't understand
[20:24] come on people brother Bram said God
[20:26] don't always tell prophets everything
[20:28] right all right but he tells us what's
[20:32] pertinent through a prophet he tells us
[20:34] what's pertinent to us all right all
[20:37] those people that that you know brother
[20:38] R told me this and that's a secret he
[20:40] told me and didn't tell somebody else
[20:42] well that may be for you but that's not
[20:43] for me buddy the 1100 sermons is when
[20:46] God was speaking to me all right I don't
[20:48] want no private Revelation that brother
[20:51] random whispered in your ear he wasn't
[20:53] that way that's right for we know in
[20:55] part and we prophesy in part but when
[20:57] that which is perfect is come or that
[20:59] which is complete or that which is made
[21:01] manifest is come then that which is in
[21:03] part shall be done away when I was a
[21:05] child I spake as a child I understood as
[21:07] a child I thought as a child but how
[21:09] when I became a man there's somewhere he
[21:12] had to be from a child to a man so he
[21:15] had to come and he had to grow to that
[21:17] is everybody with me for now we see
[21:19] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[21:21] face now I know in part but then shall I
[21:24] know even as I am known and now abideth
[21:26] faith hope and charity these three but
[21:28] the Great of this is what the headstone
[21:30] or charity or that thing says love that
[21:35] is agape love and that's what we're
[21:37] coming to the world cannot come to Agape
[21:40] Love without the new birth you can't
[21:41] have agape love agape love you have FAL
[21:44] love it gets all mixed in together and
[21:46] and Satan loves filo
[21:48] love he's about the author of fio love
[21:52] yeah he's the one that started in the
[21:53] garden everybody with me all right that
[21:56] FAL love is not in God's mind now God
[21:58] knew about it but toap love is God's
[22:01] perfect love that's that Genesis 1:26
[22:03] man we've been talking about forever and
[22:04] ever and ever we're going to see that
[22:06] that whole thing everything when you say
[22:07] Genesis 1:26 you read that scripture
[22:10] that incompasses everything God wanted
[22:12] to
[22:13] do from the beginning and it will
[22:16] culminate because he said be blessed
[22:19] have dominion do this multiply and
[22:22] replenish he tells us what to do and
[22:25] subdue the world and we're going to do
[22:27] that that all it's all wrapped up in at
[22:28] Genesis 126 man and I believe we are
[22:31] understanding it more than we than we
[22:33] ever have before you know why because
[22:35] it's inside of you saying I'm him I'm it
[22:38] this is it this is what I am I am that
[22:41] Genesis 126 person being made manifest
[22:44] in its last
[22:45] form in its last form this is the last
[22:49] form uh brother Ryan he sent me a bunch
[22:51] of scriptures the other day and some I
[22:53] had and some I didn't have about the end
[22:55] time but man you look at all those
[22:56] scriptures and you say wow no wonder
[22:59] we're no wonder we can identify where
[23:01] we're at cuz the whole Bible speaks of
[23:05] here the whole Bible speaks of Christ
[23:08] living on the earth with a group of
[23:10] people that's his children and ruling
[23:12] and reigning over the 12 tribes of
[23:14] Israel and being us being Kings and
[23:17] Priests over the whole world everybody
[23:20] with me right and that's what we're
[23:21] going to do very
[23:23] shortly but we got to have dominion over
[23:25] this guy first and I believe that's what
[23:27] the prophet brought us the the ability
[23:30] he brought us the Revelation to come to
[23:33] that Perfection because if he didn't
[23:34] somebody else has got to come if it not
[23:37] him we got to find somebody else but I
[23:39] believe it's him and I believe he gave
[23:41] us everything we needed we just got to
[23:43] keep digging and digging and digging and
[23:46] polishing and smoothing and and and
[23:49] uh strive we just got to strive We Can't
[23:53] Stop we can't quit for no I mean if
[23:56] everybody falls around you keep going if
[24:00] everybody denies this message keep going
[24:03] cuz I'll promise you it'll take you to a
[24:04] body change
[24:06] am I promise you that we which are alive
[24:10] and remain could be sitting here in this
[24:12] building right now being the very
[24:15] scripture made manifest that Paul was
[24:17] talking about if we believe that right
[24:20] so here we are at the end of the we had
[24:22] a holy ghost we had a Pentecostal age
[24:24] brother Brown came at the end of the
[24:26] Pentecostal age as elij bringing the
[24:29] Elijah anointing and then he brought two
[24:32] things and we're going to look at at
[24:34] something today that that uh that I've
[24:37] been studying on for a little bit so I
[24:38] got a little bit of that together but
[24:40] cuz brother Bram tells
[24:42] us he says we can't measure on a
[24:46] minor all right so brother brandham came
[24:49] his first part of his ministry was a
[24:52] minor don't get quiet on me it was a
[24:56] minor divine healing is a minor it will
[25:00] not change your body Divine Healing will
[25:03] heal you may make you feel better but
[25:05] brother random said you could have
[25:06] cancer be healed and die tomorrow the
[25:08] same thing and be totally
[25:11] healed and it's part of the atonement
[25:13] you can't take it
[25:15] out but come on why why are we still
[25:18] majoring on a
[25:20] minor why we still looking for for
[25:23] people to speak in tongues and and long
[25:25] prayer lines and you know people getting
[25:27] healed and and that's fine there's
[25:29] nothing wrong with it but you can't
[25:31] major on a minor and I'll read this in
[25:35] just a minute where brother R said that
[25:36] but we're right to the end now we're at
[25:38] the end of these Church ages we're
[25:39] getting ready to usher in the age of the
[25:42] of the Jews right just close
[25:46] by talking to Brother Richard Wilson
[25:49] different ones brother Jimmy Harris
[25:51] yesterday and it's just it's just
[25:53] something that that we're all looking
[25:55] for we're all looking for that we're
[25:57] looking for that culmination not 10
[25:58] years from now 5 years from now 3 years
[26:00] from now but coming up this year is
[26:02] going to change a lot this election is
[26:04] going to change a lot of things and
[26:07] people and then it's going to be just a
[26:09] very short time before we get out of
[26:12] here but you remember one thing once we
[26:15] start manifesting the son of man
[26:17] Ministry once we start manifesting the
[26:19] son of man they're going to hate us just
[26:21] like they hated him they're going to
[26:23] persecute us just like they persecuted
[26:25] him they're going to tell you your
[26:26] faults just like they told him he was
[26:28] false and he was God Almighty in human
[26:30] flesh and they turned him down so bad
[26:33] just like brother randam they turned him
[26:34] down in the last part of his ministry he
[26:36] preached to 30 people in a in a trailer
[26:38] out in Arizona somewhere over that way
[26:41] all right he'd been preaching to 200,000
[26:43] people why that was his Healing Ministry
[26:45] they couldn't get out of that heal they
[26:46] couldn't get out of the prayer
[26:48] line I'm sorry they just couldn't get
[26:50] out of the prayer line amen now never
[26:53] never never will I say we don't need
[26:55] prayer lines but we got to quit majoring
[26:57] where we have all all these meetings and
[26:59] they M they put it all on that last
[27:01] prayer line give me some
[27:03] word give me some word give me something
[27:05] to make me where I don't need to be in
[27:08] that prayer line
[27:09] again like I said before give me a give
[27:12] me a true Minister and I fail miserably
[27:14] too but give me a true Pastor that'll
[27:16] stand behind the pull
[27:18] pet and we'll be able to pray for you
[27:20] instead of having to go somewhere to be
[27:22] prayed
[27:24] for I just believe that folks it's just
[27:27] too much minor
[27:28] too much minor going
[27:31] on stuck in a
[27:33] wheel and you know what Satan loves that
[27:35] as long as we stay right here he's
[27:38] fine Brother B told Pentecostals you
[27:41] stayed right here God moved on that's
[27:45] right but Pentecost was good there's
[27:48] nothing wrong with it and listen you
[27:49] can't take laying off the hands laying
[27:51] on the hands out of the Bible because
[27:52] it's part of the
[27:54] atonement if you need it absolutely if
[27:57] you don't need it do what the Gentiles
[27:58] just believe believe in your
[28:02] heart let God transform you sitting
[28:04] where you're at instead of having having
[28:06] emotion and a feeling what are you going
[28:07] to do when you can't find somebody when
[28:09] you have to call on God yourself with no
[28:12] emotion or maybe you're just in a in a
[28:14] pickle and you you can't know where to
[28:16] go but up I've been there
[28:21] before it's not fun but it's great when
[28:24] God comes down and speaks to your heart
[28:25] and takes you out of
[28:26] it right
[28:29] we must suffer persecution we must
[28:32] suffer that we can Reign now brother R
[28:33] told us that
[28:35] right so on the day of Pentecost which
[28:38] is the isua street this is modern times
[28:41] it was under the man anointing they had
[28:43] partial Revelation because they had
[28:46] partial revelation God could not Rapture
[28:51] them all the ages had partial Revelation
[28:54] now the first age had full Revelation
[28:56] but that corn of wheat had to go the
[28:58] ground according to the Bible am so that
[29:00] you and I could come forth thank God
[29:02] they didn't take a Rapture in the first
[29:03] church age thank God they didn't take it
[29:05] in the second Church
[29:07] age but believe you me the Antichrist
[29:09] was there working already Satan is never
[29:12] far away folks don't think we've got him
[29:15] whipped and he he went that direction
[29:17] and we did the Bob and weave and we over
[29:19] here no he's probably standing there
[29:21] waiting on you to make
[29:22] it he's a true
[29:25] adversary but he's defeated
[29:28] questions and answers
[29:30] 1963 oh I really appreciate y'all being
[29:33] uh patient for me with me Sunday we're
[29:34] going to try to cut that down a little
[29:36] bit and not be so long but I enjoy doing
[29:39] questions and
[29:41] answers and some of you did too the ones
[29:43] you didn't say am man
[29:46] didn't it's just not too it's not very
[29:48] long it's not bad I like questions and
[29:51] answers though and it settles people's
[29:53] mind that's why brother rown said a
[29:55] strong church is a church that asks
[29:56] questions cuz if you said sit there with
[29:58] questions in your mind you know what
[29:59] you're doing you're you're sitting there
[30:00] asking the question over and over in
[30:02] your mind and you're not hearing what
[30:03] I'm
[30:04] saying let's get that question answer
[30:06] then there might be another one we just
[30:07] keep going on and on so right here in
[30:09] 1963 in questions and answers on the
[30:11] seals brother M tells us specifically
[30:15] there is no Messenger to that age that
[30:18] the Holy Ghost came himself in the
[30:20] fullness of the baptism now that was to
[30:23] what bring back the gifts of God they
[30:26] had been done away with in the Dark Ages
[30:28] they had been done Away by the Catholics
[30:30] Luther come in and brought some things
[30:32] in Wesley came in and brought some
[30:34] things in Pentecost is now going to
[30:36] restore the gifts so that God can send
[30:38] us a prophet so that people can
[30:40] understand who he is and what he's
[30:42] what's going on all right but it's at
[30:45] the end of the age as always ends up a
[30:47] messenger is sent and all these Scruples
[30:49] and things will be placed in their place
[30:52] which we know that brother R speaking
[30:54] this and he he pretty much at this time
[30:56] is at the first seal no question on the
[30:58] seals he's already preached six seals he
[31:01] pretty much understands now what he's
[31:02] doing I believe he does I believe he
[31:05] understands that he's the messenger and
[31:07] there's a message and there's a group of
[31:09] people but that group of people's not
[31:10] here that group of people's coming which
[31:13] is US
[31:15] am cuz listen God can't Rapture
[31:19] something that's not perfect or he would
[31:22] have already raptured somebody
[31:24] else there's a place we got to come to
[31:27] that God's going to Rapture a group of
[31:29] people because they come to the
[31:31] completeness that he
[31:33] saw before the foundation of the world
[31:36] right so he had to he had to send us a
[31:40] message how's the Baptist going to make
[31:42] it saying that you just get a letter and
[31:44] once saved always saved you know you get
[31:46] saved at 9 years old you don't go back
[31:48] to church till you're 40 or 50 and you
[31:49] die at 60 I've been to many Baptist
[31:52] funerals and I know the people they
[31:54] didn't never go to church a day in their
[31:55] life but at N 9 years old they got saved
[31:58] signed a letter once saved always saved
[32:01] now once Born Again always born again
[32:03] but I don't I don't believe that you can
[32:05] get saved and then not show up at
[32:09] church so how's God going but now listen
[32:11] how's God that's not in the word of God
[32:14] that's their interpretation God is not
[32:16] going to Rapture interpretation that's
[32:18] wrong right right he had to send a
[32:22] prophet that had what divine
[32:24] interpretation that had that knew
[32:26] exactly the mind it wasn't it wasn't
[32:28] three or four or five denominations
[32:30] coming down and then brother no it was
[32:32] brother R God spoke to brother R and
[32:34] said this is that send him an angel said
[32:36] I'm an angel sent from God and this is
[32:38] what you're to
[32:40] do what a mighty God we
[32:44] serve and that word is transformed into
[32:46] me and
[32:47] you so the gifts were restored 1
[32:51] Corinthians 12 which is wisdom knowledge
[32:53] Faith healing Miracles I love these twoo
[32:56] I the speaking in tongues is okay okay
[32:58] but I like I like to have the knowledge
[33:00] of the word of God and people to have
[33:02] faith and people to be healed and there
[33:04] be Miracles we've seen all these things
[33:06] amen right
[33:10] right but that's the
[33:13] minor the tongues and interpretations is
[33:16] the into the into the uh prayer line and
[33:19] it's discernment but it's the
[33:21] minor right now then there's these other
[33:24] gifts that come into the church now
[33:25] after the pastor then there's evangelist
[33:27] comes in then there's teachers prophets
[33:29] then there's Apostles all things
[33:31] together working together with the gifts
[33:33] now watch to keep the church perfected
[33:35] not a tape not a
[33:37] book right a Ministry a five-fold
[33:41] Ministry to keep the church clean to
[33:44] keep the church straight to keep the
[33:46] sheep in the right Sheepfold all right
[33:49] eating the right grass right and being
[33:52] protected by the right Shepherd keeps
[33:54] the church perfected and clean and ready
[33:58] for the coming of the Lord like I said
[34:00] before he's going to come after a group
[34:02] of people without what spot or
[34:05] wrinkle now he's going to have to do
[34:08] it all right we can't do that but
[34:10] through the word we've got to be able to
[34:12] put our faith back into the word of God
[34:14] listen the same Faith you got today that
[34:17] when you got born again ever how many
[34:18] years ago use that same faith for
[34:20] whatever you need now cuz it brought God
[34:23] on the scene over here it brought
[34:24] something over here to you that you
[34:26] didn't have let's have have that same
[34:28] Faith let's go back and we can go back
[34:30] to that childlike Faith but we can't
[34:31] stay there we can't start walking and
[34:34] then go back and crawl but we can't go
[34:36] back and say God right here's where I
[34:38] met you at right here's where I got
[34:40] something from you this is the scripture
[34:42] this is my scripture I'm going to read
[34:44] it again this is mine this is for my
[34:46] kids this is for my people this is for
[34:49] what they need this is my word right
[34:51] here this is for me not for no one else
[34:53] you start doing that claiming that part
[34:55] of the scripture you'll be there with
[34:57] you all off Spring you're going to take
[34:59] a body change we which are alive and
[35:00] remain you all those different things
[35:02] start claiming it start walking in it
[35:06] you say well see here we go we're
[35:08] majoring on a minor again the minor is
[35:10] well I didn't feel a
[35:12] thing come on we're humans I didn't feel
[35:15] a
[35:16] thing it didn't ask you how you felt it
[35:19] actually you did you believe it and it
[35:21] may take weeks before it's manifested
[35:23] may take months before it's manifested
[35:25] and it may manifest in a miracle right
[35:27] there but you got to have what patience
[35:30] to wait on God remember what brother
[35:32] Brown said what patience who patience on
[35:34] who he didn't say your neighbor he
[35:36] didn't say your wife remember in statute
[35:39] perfect man he said the first thing you
[35:40] got to have patience with is who God you
[35:42] got to have patience with God that he'll
[35:45] do what he said he will
[35:47] do regardless if the World Turns Upside
[35:51] Down we were talking today and you know
[35:54] they got the cat and dog thing in the in
[35:56] the schools now where they can
[35:58] they can identify as a cat or a dog
[36:00] and you think it's crazy they do it take
[36:04] their own little litter box with them to
[36:08] school how crazy is that I said if my
[36:11] kid ever walked in and said he was a cat
[36:13] you know what I do I take him to the
[36:16] vet praise the Lord anyhow we found the
[36:19] study of the scriptures that's a m they
[36:21] treat cats a lot different than they
[36:22] treat people so we'll take them to the
[36:25] bat and see how see how much they want
[36:26] to they want to uh identify as a cat but
[36:29] that's the world and you know what
[36:30] though we were talking and they were
[36:31] they made a good point today we were
[36:33] talking about it we had a little
[36:34] downtime at the post office and one one
[36:37] lady and she's a good Methodist girl she
[36:38] said you know she said if this thing
[36:40] goes two more Generations that's we're
[36:43] looking at it as abnormal she said two
[36:46] generations from now that'll be normal
[36:48] that's
[36:49] right cuz every generation gets weaker
[36:52] and you you you start accepting things
[36:53] that's what Satan does he brings little
[36:56] things in and he pushes and you accept
[36:58] it he pushes it and you accept it that's
[37:00] why we shouldn't accept any of that junk
[37:02] we shouldn't accept what the devil
[37:03] brings us we shouldn't accept the world
[37:05] and what they give
[37:06] us so we found in study of the
[37:09] scriptures the messenger of the age
[37:10] comes right at the end of the age so
[37:12] what age did Brother Bram come at he
[37:14] came at the end of that Pentecostal age
[37:17] that we were talking about 1906 isza
[37:19] Street to bring us a message that's
[37:22] going to take us in a Rapture amen all
[37:24] right that's going to take us to
[37:26] perfection all right no other one none
[37:28] of these we see here now watch at the
[37:31] end of the Pentecostal age we're
[37:33] supposed to receive according to the
[37:34] word God help me tonight to show you
[37:36] through here that we are to receive look
[37:38] not a message a messenger and then he's
[37:39] going to have a message that will take
[37:42] all these loose ends now what's the
[37:44] Loose Ends the Loose Ends is what's
[37:46] keeping us here
[37:48] right God can't Rapture loose ends or he
[37:51] would already done it he can't capture
[37:54] he can't do that he can't Rapture Loose
[37:56] Ends he can't perfect Loose Ends but God
[37:58] thank God he sent us somebody that could
[38:00] put that back together he could tie
[38:02] eternity back together oh praise the
[38:04] Lord listen we're the most privileged
[38:06] people in the world the world looks at
[38:09] us and we're
[38:11] crazy you believe a what and he did
[38:14] what like I said before I'm reading that
[38:17] book about the that Gordon Lindsay wrote
[38:20] so you brother brandom Gordon linday
[38:22] wrote a book about the Great Men of of
[38:24] of the era are back from I gu gu Luther
[38:28] Wesley sanki Calvin finny I mean he
[38:30] lists everyone and he just Praises him
[38:32] never List brother brandham one time and
[38:34] he knew brother
[38:35] brandham Gordon Lindsay was with brother
[38:37] ROM until he started preaching the truth
[38:40] I mean he wasn't preaching ER but he got
[38:41] out of that minor part and then started
[38:44] preaching Doctrine and Gordon Lindsay
[38:46] left him but he's that brother R's name
[38:48] is not in that book that's a shame
[38:52] that's a shame it's a shame and it's not
[38:54] a shame to quote these other brothers
[38:57] Moody sanky Calvin they had a part but
[38:59] they had part you and I are sitting
[39:02] today under the
[39:04] fullness we have no restrictions except
[39:07] what's between your two
[39:09] ears that's the only restriction you got
[39:12] you can't say I don't have this yes you
[39:14] have that I don't have enough yes you
[39:17] have enough of that I haven't found it
[39:19] you ain't look hard enough that's
[39:22] right it's all on us God laid it out
[39:25] there and we to find it
[39:28] if it was so easy then yeah the whole
[39:30] world would say yeah that's good that's
[39:32] all right we're good we got this message
[39:35] yeah but can you live
[39:37] it that was Gordon Lindsay's problem
[39:39] when brother R started preaching truth
[39:41] and Doctrine it was so far away that
[39:43] every from every all those other great
[39:44] men which were great men God winked at
[39:47] their ignorance he didn't need
[39:48] Perfection from them come on he didn't
[39:51] need Perfection for Dwight Moody but
[39:53] brother Ram said Dwight Moody sent
[39:54] millions of people to
[39:56] heaven preaching simple Doctrine but
[39:59] that his requirement was not to tie
[40:01] loose ends
[40:02] up or Roberts was not to tie loose ends
[40:05] up right Billy Graham was not to TI ends
[40:09] up it was to get people to Christ and
[40:11] get them to see enough for salvation at
[40:14] least get them out of Sodom as the two
[40:16] witnesses did down there get at least
[40:18] get one or two get three of them out
[40:21] four if Mama hadn't turned around looked
[40:24] back at
[40:24] Sodom so now look
[40:28] now Look at That Shook we've talked
[40:30] about this the other day I want to just
[40:32] kind of redo it for a minute there's a
[40:34] teeny butt of grain coming on there's
[40:36] the real thing see that's what God's
[40:38] been looking
[40:39] for all right if this went in the ground
[40:41] at nah this this black I mean this blue
[40:44] bottle cap if it went in the ground at
[40:46] Nia everybody with me and it got
[40:49] almost cut down the bride tree got cut
[40:52] down but it had power in The Roots You
[40:55] Got to kill the roots of a plan or grow
[40:57] right back up you can cut a great big
[40:58] tree down and if it's got all the sap
[41:00] still in the in the uh Roots it'll start
[41:03] sprouting again so what happened was
[41:05] that started sprouting again now what's
[41:07] God looking for he's not looking for
[41:09] stalk he's not looking for shuck he's
[41:12] looking for this again this was the
[41:14] original that went in the ground and
[41:16] Christ went in the ground to remember to
[41:18] come back to us on the day of Pentecost
[41:21] right but then the church had to go into
[41:23] the ground so that you could come to
[41:25] Perfection and get this out of the
[41:27] ground the life you you can't see it
[41:30] though Luther doesn't look like
[41:32] Perfection but he was perfect to God for
[41:35] what he had he had the stock which the
[41:37] life was coming up through it right then
[41:40] then Wesley had the two shoots still the
[41:43] life but none of this this is hidden in
[41:46] here somewhere right I love that the
[41:50] apple tree you take one apple and you
[41:52] put it in the
[41:53] ground it'll grow and produce more
[41:56] apples next year it'll produce more
[41:58] apples every Apple that was on that tree
[42:00] was in that little old seed that ain't
[42:02] much bigger it ain't as big as your
[42:03] fingernail every every seed has got that
[42:09] potential so the seed went in the ground
[42:12] seed the
[42:13] word god covered it up through the Dark
[42:16] Ages and then Luther now when it popped
[42:19] up it didn't pop this
[42:21] up but this is what God's looking for he
[42:23] didn't say I will restore the
[42:26] stock no cuz he know that worm ate all
[42:28] that stock down he ate all the plant
[42:30] down all but the life right I will
[42:33] restore what
[42:35] this and this what went in the ground
[42:38] was the son of man that's right the son
[42:41] of man went in the ground amen all right
[42:44] but now the life one in the ground now
[42:47] what's God looking for again he's
[42:48] looking for that son of man
[42:51] again that's why I see it more clear now
[42:53] than ever seen it in my life Jesus
[42:55] Christ not in body form like we were
[42:57] talking about Sunday he's not coming
[42:59] back in body form until the
[43:02] Millennium but he you and I are so much
[43:05] his part till we are him amen that's
[43:09] right this is what he's looking for this
[43:12] is it and this is me and you this is the
[43:14] end time bride in one little
[43:17] seed cuz what's it going to do it's
[43:19] going to come up now you're going to
[43:20] have a shook now what does a Shu do a
[43:22] Shu does this right
[43:24] here you gardeners know what I mean even
[43:27] and you look at wheat if you look at
[43:28] wheat and you look at little hairy
[43:29] looking thing on the wheat that's a
[43:31] shove that's not the seed that's why you
[43:33] have to wnow wheat which means you got
[43:36] to throw it up in the air you look on
[43:39] YouTube if you don't know what I'm
[43:40] talking about they take it overseas and
[43:41] instead of now America we we have
[43:43] blowers that blow that off but they
[43:46] don't have that over in the Far East and
[43:49] they take and throw it up in the air
[43:51] with the pitch Fort looking thing and
[43:53] you see the the chaff and the and the
[43:56] and the uh Chuck you see the the wind
[43:58] take it all way well what falls to the
[44:01] ground the
[44:03] wheat and that looks just
[44:05] like what was planted in the ground four
[44:08] months
[44:10] before amen so
[44:14] this this this seed that's here now
[44:17] looks just like the seed that went in
[44:19] the
[44:20] ground that's why it's a son of man
[44:22] Ministry folks it can't be can't be a
[44:25] spirit it's got to be a man and human
[44:27] flesh a man I'm talking about a
[44:29] many-membered
[44:30] body that that culminates into the one
[44:34] seed plant remember not to seeds that
[44:37] are
[44:38] many but to one seed which is
[44:41] Christ amen and you and I are Mage Jesus
[44:44] Christ I was thinking yesterday more and
[44:46] more we keep looking at these things and
[44:48] I keep studying a little bit more just
[44:50] on the common things like water baptism
[44:53] why do we take that name why did Jesus
[44:55] tell us in the name of he told us
[44:57] exactly what to do but the devil said no
[45:00] stay right there cuz that's not a
[45:04] name don't tell me brother don't tell me
[45:06] Jesus don't tell me God came up with the
[45:08] father son Holy Ghost baptism brother R
[45:10] said it was come from the pits of
[45:13] Hell direct
[45:16] quote he said that Doctrine came from
[45:19] the pits of hell it came right out of
[45:21] Jesus's
[45:22] mouth but it came from the pits of
[45:25] hell you had to have a re ation cuz them
[45:28] people sitting there was like you could
[45:30] have said anything but that brother BR
[45:31] we're
[45:32] gone you're saying Jesus was p no he
[45:35] wasn't he was saying they didn't have
[45:37] the right Revelation see you and I have
[45:38] the right
[45:40] Revelation so guess what check that off
[45:44] take that loose end and tie it up
[45:46] brother Bob and pull a pull it together
[45:48] cuz we've got that one remember we got
[45:50] to go to Perfection Paul said don't go
[45:52] back to this we don't have to keep
[45:54] proving water baptism now we do the
[45:57] younger ones we know that but now me and
[45:58] you if I come up Sunday and all y'all
[46:00] are pretty mature and here been here for
[46:02] a long time and I preach on water
[46:04] baptism then next Wednesday I preach on
[46:06] water baptism and then next Sunday I
[46:07] preach on water baptism eventually y'all
[46:10] find somebody that'll preach to you
[46:11] something else besides water baptism we
[46:14] got that you know you we got
[46:17] that amen so Paul said let's go on to
[46:20] Perfection brother B said let's go on
[46:22] let's tie the lot let's tie the loose
[46:24] ends together and that was the first
[46:27] part of his ministry that was the that
[46:29] was the bait on the hook and all the
[46:30] different things at the beginning but
[46:32] the real message was after all that was
[46:35] like I was going to read it but I don't
[46:37] have time I'm going to try to stop a
[46:38] little bit early tonight uh I said try
[46:41] I'm about to
[46:43] close that's what brother kri dig says
[46:46] I'm about to
[46:47] close but uh you go to Elijah on Mount
[46:51] Caramel remember those 400 prophets they
[46:54] tore that altar to Pieces that's right
[46:57] yeah now what did what did the Bible say
[47:00] Elijah put those
[47:02] stones back together he told him how
[47:06] this he he said look you've tore this
[47:08] thing apart brother Brown said you've
[47:10] tore this thing
[47:11] apart you prophets of Baal now he didn't
[47:14] say Baal he had a lot more grace than
[47:16] that but he was pretty much telling them
[47:18] they tore the they tore religion
[47:20] apart it just become a denomination but
[47:23] Elijah before God came on the scene
[47:26] though Elijah had to put them Stones
[47:27] back where they were right and he knew
[47:30] that cuz he restored them back he put
[47:33] those back to where they were supposed
[47:34] to go then God came on the scene well
[47:36] guess what brother R did the same thing
[47:37] he comes on the scene with all those
[47:39] prophets jumping up and down and say we
[47:41] got a we got a trinitarian Doctrine we
[47:43] got three gods and I was listening to
[47:45] somebody the other day on Moody and he
[47:47] tried to explain to Trinity and I know a
[47:50] lot but I was really confused when he
[47:52] got
[47:53] done I I started to call in not going
[47:56] down the road I started call in go could
[47:58] you explain that just one more
[48:01] time he was talking about this was a
[48:03] person and this was a person and and
[48:05] this person was this one and came over
[48:07] to this one and and I just didn't
[48:10] understand it I I thought man just
[48:11] believe in one God but you know what why
[48:14] can't we why you know why cuz it's the
[48:16] spirit of the age it's the spirit that
[48:19] came that trinitarian pulled it apart
[48:22] right n pulled it apart false Doctrine
[48:25] pulled it apart and give us three gods
[48:28] and they can't explain it they try but
[48:32] they just can't I just believe here
[48:34] Israel the Lord thy God is one and he
[48:37] and morphe's into different forms and
[48:40] right now he's in the last in morphe
[48:41] he's in me and you that's pretty much
[48:44] self-explanatory to
[48:46] me so there's a little teeny bit of
[48:48] grain coming in there's the real thing
[48:50] see we got to come back to the real not
[48:52] that it was false but remember partial
[48:55] to perfect
[48:57] partial to perfect brother R said here's
[48:59] my hand it's up against the wall that's
[49:02] a shadow of it but there had to be an
[49:04] original before there could be a shadow
[49:06] there had to be an original dollar
[49:07] before they could counterfeit a dollar
[49:08] off of it all right so there had to be a
[49:11] real and this is real but that got lost
[49:13] down Through the
[49:15] Ages the real got
[49:17] lost oh there was
[49:20] pieces but with me and you that which is
[49:23] perfect is come that which is imp part
[49:24] to be done away with we don't work work
[49:26] on counterfeit anymore we don't work on
[49:29] we hope this is right anymore I hope you
[49:36] don't if this ain't it I'm telling you
[49:39] as much fun as I've been having if this
[49:42] ain't it the one if it's coming a lot
[49:43] more fun that'll take us in Rapture but
[49:46] this is it right here this is going to
[49:47] Rapture us we're going to see this in
[49:49] the next if God allows another year or
[49:52] so we're going to see the culmination of
[49:54] everything God told us to that Prophet
[49:56] would take
[49:57] place there's some things that had took
[49:59] place
[50:02] yet and we know for sure those two
[50:05] prophets are over there in Israel right
[50:06] now they got to be and they may be
[50:08] fighting and they God may be protecting
[50:10] them but I mean they're they're throwing
[50:11] bombs at each other like crazy over
[50:13] there but I like Israel they stood up
[50:17] again the other day and said look we
[50:19] didn't ask for your permission we didn't
[50:21] need your help to begin
[50:23] with and the United States is going well
[50:25] you you need our no we don't need your
[50:27] help you can help us if you want to but
[50:29] we don't really need your help so they
[50:32] went over there and just took that one
[50:33] guy out and they even had a Drone
[50:35] footage of the guy they droned him they
[50:37] put that drone right in the room where
[50:38] the man was that leader saan or whatever
[50:42] his name was y y and they took him out I
[50:46] mean they showed it taking him out so
[50:49] don't mess with God's people they're
[50:50] still God's people God's still fighting
[50:53] for them he's still fighting with them
[50:55] and as long as we do we'll be fine but
[50:56] when we turn against Israel we're
[50:58] done and we're going to be out of here
[51:00] because that means that the man of sin
[51:02] is coming and he's going to make a
[51:04] contract with them and we're not going
[51:05] to be here to see it so don't worry
[51:07] folks it ain't going to be a long
[51:09] time but now what was that shook
[51:12] Pentecost protected the grain it allowed
[51:15] that grain to mature but what happened
[51:17] was the Shu fall fell away
[51:22] watch now it looks just perfectly no
[51:24] wonder Jesus said it would deceive the
[51:25] very elect if possible looks just like
[51:28] the grain right in the place the grain
[51:30] ought to be cuz it's so close it's right
[51:33] here it did the same thing that the
[51:35] others did before organized what did it
[51:38] become a
[51:41] carrier now let's read I'm going to read
[51:43] this real quick and we'll get back off
[51:44] of it back on again but brother brownman
[51:46] 1956 and here you here you him now watch
[51:49] what he says now I want to say to you
[51:51] last night we took tonight was
[51:53] Evangelistic call friends Divine Healing
[51:56] is just a
[51:58] minor we still believe brother Ryan was
[52:00] a prophet right and you can
[52:04] never do you believe what the prophet
[52:06] says he didn't say you can compromise
[52:08] and kind of he said you will never major
[52:11] on a
[52:13] minor as I said salvation of the soul is
[52:17] much greater than Divine Healing Divine
[52:20] Healing was included in the new
[52:22] atonement because the old atonement had
[52:25] healing in it and the new new one is
[52:27] much better than than the old if the old
[52:30] one could furnish healing what about the
[52:32] new one other words under bulls and
[52:35] goats they were healed they had Waters
[52:37] they had different things you know
[52:38] before the the Holy Ghost came on a
[52:40] group of people and they started praying
[52:41] for the sick that's right you didn't
[52:44] hear them praying for the sick in the
[52:45] Old Testament cuz they
[52:46] didn't remember what brother Brown said
[52:48] he said I he said I sure wished I could
[52:50] put my hand in Moses's script bag
[52:52] whatever he had in there to heal all and
[52:54] heal his hand and all that stuff that
[52:56] was just partial to what when Jesus
[52:58] stood there and
[52:59] said divide the Loaves and Fishes and
[53:03] raise up go do this go do that and
[53:05] everything just did what he
[53:08] said I'll get to something not this
[53:10] today but I want to get to something
[53:11] about
[53:13] that you got to read what Jesus
[53:17] said because if if we if we're to be the
[53:20] son of man in the end time we've got to
[53:22] do what that man
[53:24] did everybody with me I think Dad told
[53:27] us a long time ago read Matthew Mark
[53:28] Luke and John that's the son of man all
[53:30] right now now the manifestation of what
[53:34] he preached imp partial I'm sorry to say
[53:37] that but Paul said he's prophesied in
[53:39] part but read those four
[53:43] gospels that's the son of man Ministry
[53:45] so whatever happened to him is going to
[53:47] happen to us now listen the only part is
[53:49] we don't have we don't have to be
[53:50] crucified now we'd be
[53:52] crucified but not on a cross he was
[53:55] crucified once for all nobody we don't
[53:57] have to go to a cross but we have to
[54:00] bear a cross you understand that so
[54:03] partial to perfect the transition now
[54:06] the change from one thing to the next so
[54:07] we're changing now just like the Old
[54:09] Testament as John come on the scene and
[54:12] Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the
[54:13] sin of the world the first coming of
[54:15] Christ right everybody with me brother
[54:18] brandom was the same thing he comes to
[54:20] the end of
[54:22] the beautiful he comes at the end of the
[54:25] church age Paul arenus Martin Luther
[54:27] Columba all the way up Pentecost he
[54:29] stands right here and tells the people
[54:32] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[54:34] the sin of the world Jesus Christ the
[54:36] same yesterday today and forever you got
[54:38] to come here you got to come here
[54:41] because God has moved from here to
[54:43] here and then look he didn't point us to
[54:46] himself he pointed us to
[54:48] Christ which is the word of God
[54:51] everybody knows that so transition is a
[54:54] change from one to the next so John the
[54:55] Baptist stood
[54:57] and he took him from the Old Testament
[54:59] into the New Testament brother Rah took
[55:01] him from getting away from
[55:04] everything come on cuz he was to restore
[55:08] what was gone to bring the what faith of
[55:11] the fathers back because the faith of
[55:14] the fathers was what they didn't have
[55:16] these Loose
[55:17] Ends they didn't have them over here
[55:20] Paul never preached the trinitarian
[55:21] doctrine Luther never I mean um John
[55:24] never preached the trinitarian doctrine
[55:25] none of those first they didn't have
[55:27] that in their in their mind now there
[55:29] was people there that
[55:30] did but not them not the original one
[55:33] well we've come back now to the original
[55:35] thing but brother randam said I know
[55:37] what happened Satan said okay I feel
[55:40] that anointing
[55:42] too it's cool over here I think I'll
[55:44] stay right
[55:45] here I never found this spot
[55:49] before but they got an anointing and and
[55:52] Satan
[55:54] says I think I'll go over
[55:56] here this is where he knows what's
[55:59] true remember he was from the beginning
[56:02] he just don't like it and what he's
[56:04] doing is he's trying to get you not to
[56:06] like
[56:08] it he's he's he's really not trying to
[56:11] get us to worship
[56:13] him he's getting us to not worship
[56:17] God therefore we'll worship Him turn our
[56:20] eyes to him but Satan comes along and he
[56:22] comes right here and he he gets in that
[56:23] Pentecostal I'll read it he gets in that
[56:26] P OST and he starts breaking them up
[56:28] into all these different isms and
[56:30] schisms and Tess and threeness and
[56:32] Church of God of Christ Church of God
[56:35] there's thousands of different
[56:36] Pentecostal denominations and God never
[56:39] set a one of them
[56:40] up Satan said every one of them up
[56:43] that's why brother Bram said come out of
[56:44] her my people you and I are the ones
[56:46] that he came for to get us out of that
[56:49] that Pentecostal age and get us into the
[56:52] bride
[56:54] age well you can be happy about that if
[56:55] you want to but I'm sure I'm happy about
[56:58] it I'm sure I don't have to go to a
[57:00] church where you got to speak in tongues
[57:02] and and you got to shout to have the
[57:03] Holy
[57:06] Ghost we'd all be in
[57:09] trouble cuz y'all don't do that neither
[57:12] do
[57:12] I hello
[57:16] somebody but somewhere in that ugly
[57:18] caterpillar is a
[57:20] butterfly caterpillars are not
[57:22] pretty they're ugly but what's inside of
[57:25] that thing is really beautiful so what
[57:28] we got to do let it out all right
[57:30] Hebrews 6 verse1 said therefore leaving
[57:32] the principles what the Cornerstone of
[57:34] the doctrines of Christ like I said
[57:36] before we don't have to preach water
[57:37] baptism every service sure we can add it
[57:39] in when we got new people sure we can if
[57:41] anybody has a question we'll go back and
[57:43] answer it but you shouldn't have you
[57:45] should have that settled in your heart
[57:46] in this church right here today that
[57:48] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[57:49] Jesus Christ is the only correct baptism
[57:52] so now we can move on so build on that
[57:53] don't go back to that don't go back
[57:56] three years from now or three years
[57:58] before and go I wonder if that's right
[58:00] no come on you got to have that
[58:02] established in your heart cuz we got to
[58:05] go on to Perfection let that be your
[58:09] foundation listen if you start right
[58:11] you'll end right if you don't start
[58:14] right you got to go back to right so you
[58:16] can get out here that's why brother
[58:18] brandom said listen I can lay a straight
[58:22] wall not a problem but when you turn a
[58:25] corner you got to get that angle exactly
[58:28] right cuz if you don't when you get from
[58:31] here 30 ft down that way what does it
[58:33] start doing it goes completely off the
[58:38] foundation you know how I know that come
[58:40] to my house me and daddy didn't read
[58:42] something right down one corner
[58:44] and we almost had to lay another
[58:46] Foundation it stayed on it but it was
[58:49] about that far off but we had we didn't
[58:51] we didn't have the thing done exactly
[58:52] right and you listen you can't go back
[58:54] once the mortar's already already
[58:57] dry so turning a corner has to be
[59:00] something that God does to make it
[59:03] perfect and God with a prophet he turned
[59:05] a corner with a prophet called William
[59:07] brandom all right so Paul said look
[59:10] therefore leaving the principles of the
[59:11] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[59:13] Perfection The Headstone the son of man
[59:15] who was the most perfect man on the
[59:16] world in the world Listen Christianity
[59:19] will tell you who was perfect the son of
[59:22] man the son of man was perfect they just
[59:25] don't know
[59:26] and hadn't been taught that that same
[59:28] Spirit of that son of man is inside of
[59:31] you and then the anointing for the end
[59:33] time is for us to be just like
[59:35] him oh no you can't see there you
[59:39] go H you think you're perfect in Christ
[59:43] yes I am that's right if you put it in
[59:46] him cuz what is the son of man what is
[59:49] perfection is the finisher it's the it's
[59:51] what whatever you're done is perfected
[59:54] one who has in his own p person rais
[59:57] Faith to its
[59:59] Perfection remember there's faith for
[1:00:01] the time right brother brother Dale
[1:00:04] preached that years ago that the little
[1:00:06] woman said well had faith for the time
[1:00:09] the woman at the him of the God had
[1:00:12] faith for her time she didn't have faith
[1:00:14] listen she didn't have faith for a body
[1:00:17] change because obviously she's dead
[1:00:19] somewhere laying in the Tomb over there
[1:00:20] so is Lazarus so is everybody except the
[1:00:23] people they're out here now right
[1:00:26] so she had faith for the time to get her
[1:00:28] where she needed to go you and I have
[1:00:30] got to be what the
[1:00:32] finisher cuz remember he's the
[1:00:35] author and
[1:00:37] finisher of our
[1:00:39] faith so faith has got to come to a
[1:00:41] raise Faith to its Perfection and so set
[1:00:44] before us the highest example of Faith
[1:00:49] then Paul continues on not laying again
[1:00:50] the foundation of repentance from dead
[1:00:52] works and of Faith toward god of the
[1:00:54] doctrine of baptism laying on of hands
[1:00:56] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:00:58] judgment this we will do if God permit
[1:01:00] and God has permitted 2,000 years am to
[1:01:03] get it right all
[1:01:05] right so the Cornerstone was the church
[1:01:08] ages partial Revelation The Headstone
[1:01:10] the son of man is the perfect Revelation
[1:01:13] now brother brandham worked under paral
[1:01:15] partial Revelation come on
[1:01:17] somebody brother brandham preached
[1:01:21] wrong Doctrine
[1:01:26] don't get quiet on me he said he
[1:01:29] did right he said if I would have made a
[1:01:33] horrible mistake if I have preached what
[1:01:34] I preached
[1:01:35] before when the angel came in the room
[1:01:38] and told me
[1:01:40] this boy people don't like that but you
[1:01:42] know what partial to perfect thank God
[1:01:44] he was man enough that whole week of the
[1:01:47] seals he was man enough to stand in that
[1:01:49] pull pit and say I was
[1:01:51] wrong this was wrong far beyond what I
[1:01:53] thought he thought the souls under the
[1:01:55] alt was y'all the dead Saints it went
[1:01:58] open amen it's on tape it's in
[1:02:03] books thank God for a man that was
[1:02:05] honest he didn't hide
[1:02:09] nothing but then that which is perfect
[1:02:14] came when no seals open that's when God
[1:02:17] turned that thing and said all right
[1:02:19] buddy this is what you
[1:02:21] preach that white horse rider is not the
[1:02:24] Holy Ghost like you preached it was the
[1:02:25] mighty conquer back in the ' 50s ain't
[1:02:28] that
[1:02:29] right those Souls under the altar
[1:02:32] they're not crying how long to avenge
[1:02:33] our blood H that's not
[1:02:36] saints Saints don't cry for
[1:02:38] vengeance but that had been hid but once
[1:02:41] that book was open and brother Ram could
[1:02:44] see when that angel came every day in
[1:02:45] that room and gave him Revelation and
[1:02:48] said look now remember let me get
[1:02:51] something straight an angel never gave
[1:02:53] him a revelation
[1:02:56] that's right right I can't give you one
[1:02:59] brother brandham can't give you one only
[1:03:01] God can give you a
[1:03:04] revelation so I believe as as Dad said
[1:03:07] many times before I believe that angel
[1:03:09] they've been with him I that angel was
[1:03:10] with him all the
[1:03:13] time and I believe he just said William
[1:03:16] Brandon what you been preaching been
[1:03:17] preaching one God and here it is right
[1:03:19] here he said so who's that guy riding
[1:03:22] that horse and you said it was me or or
[1:03:25] God who is that you got two people you
[1:03:28] always said if you had two people one
[1:03:29] was the devil and then it just clicked
[1:03:31] and brother Ram now remember cuz watch
[1:03:32] what he said if you go back to the seals
[1:03:34] he said I spent the whole
[1:03:36] day going through scripture after
[1:03:38] scripture after scripture what lining
[1:03:40] that thing back
[1:03:41] up to where now we can stand here today
[1:03:45] every minister in this gospel every
[1:03:47] minister in this church age in this
[1:03:51] message can preach the truth if we want
[1:03:54] to just like the prophet
[1:04:00] did cuz folks he's
[1:04:05] gone his body is laying up here in
[1:04:08] Jeffersonville his soul is in the sixth
[1:04:11] Dimension he's waiting on somebody to
[1:04:14] preach a Perfection that he preached
[1:04:15] while he was here
[1:04:18] right and I contend that's us I just
[1:04:21] contend that's every day I get up I
[1:04:24] somewhere during that day I think
[1:04:26] it's so good to be in this message and
[1:04:29] you know what I'm not a I'm not a
[1:04:30] brandom parakeet I had had a preacher
[1:04:32] one time said I'm just a I'm just a
[1:04:35] parakeet for brother brandom I said well
[1:04:37] now I'm not brother I just I just can't
[1:04:39] be that I can't be a
[1:04:42] parakeet cuz that's just saying what
[1:04:44] somebody else says I want God to speak
[1:04:47] to me through those tapes speak to me
[1:04:49] through those books and let me come to
[1:04:51] that Revelation let my Holy Ghost
[1:04:56] be so free to where it takes all that
[1:04:59] and says that ain't nothing but the
[1:05:02] truth well you know what he done to had
[1:05:04] it right it brought eternal life to her
[1:05:08] children just for just by saying that
[1:05:10] ain't nothing but the
[1:05:12] truth why don't we start saying that
[1:05:14] sometime I know when you say Amen you
[1:05:17] say it ain't nothing but the truth
[1:05:19] because you wouldn't amen if you didn't
[1:05:20] think it was
[1:05:21] true but we know what to amen for right
[1:05:25] some of you ought to try
[1:05:28] it
[1:05:30] exactly now look then we find out we've
[1:05:33] been studying that down Through the Ages
[1:05:35] we had reformers that's what we've been
[1:05:36] talking about pieces they've had pieces
[1:05:39] each office carried its own work but
[1:05:41] when the real thing is to be revealed at
[1:05:43] the last time look of the last part of
[1:05:47] the church that's us right there is no
[1:05:50] other bride Church coming this is it
[1:05:54] it's when God has said he would send to
[1:05:56] us according to the scripture we've
[1:05:58] searched it that he predicted the spirit
[1:06:00] of Elijah will returning some person
[1:06:03] it'll be profly properly identified and
[1:06:05] we know it was absolutely know it was
[1:06:07] properly identified so Malachi 4 he
[1:06:11] turned the heart of the children of the
[1:06:12] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:06:14] with a curse that's brother brandom part
[1:06:16] the part before that was John the
[1:06:17] Baptist remember so brother randam was
[1:06:20] sent two Pentecostal babies to bring
[1:06:23] them to maturity amen now what they done
[1:06:26] with it was their
[1:06:28] business and you know what they did they
[1:06:31] loved him they loved him when they could
[1:06:33] get 25,000 people in an auditorium and
[1:06:36] they'd be healings one right after the
[1:06:38] other all the pent and then somebody pop
[1:06:40] up and speak in tongues and prophesying
[1:06:42] and all that they just that was that was
[1:06:44] their Glory Days but they said this is
[1:06:47] it brother randam stood one day and said
[1:06:49] listen you say this is it you lat rain
[1:06:52] people say this is it he said you a't
[1:06:54] had the know words I hadn't started
[1:06:57] teaching
[1:06:58] yet the truth the real I mean digging
[1:07:01] down and digging in the truth and
[1:07:03] telling them water baptism and Lord
[1:07:05] Jesus Christ was the only way to baptize
[1:07:07] telling them there was no eternal hell
[1:07:09] telling them that that that they come to
[1:07:11] a place of marriage and divorce where
[1:07:12] your sins are forgiven and all these
[1:07:14] different things and and where God gives
[1:07:16] Grace and then we look at all these
[1:07:17] other different things that they didn't
[1:07:20] want to hear that they
[1:07:21] left what me and brother Jimmy was
[1:07:23] talking about yesterday you know brother
[1:07:25] brandom when when he preached the seals
[1:07:26] he said he said all my friends are going
[1:07:28] to leave me I think he made it a mount
[1:07:31] but when he preached marriage and
[1:07:34] divorce I think he said
[1:07:37] thousands he said look out office he
[1:07:40] said here it comes you know why because
[1:07:42] that was the separating part CU remember
[1:07:45] the woman said afterwards remember
[1:07:46] brother Ram said she said brother
[1:07:48] brandham you forgive those people their
[1:07:50] sins he said she wasn't far off from
[1:07:53] that ain't that what she what he said
[1:07:55] right
[1:07:57] CU listen folks the Bible tells us
[1:08:00] whosoever sins you remit they're
[1:08:03] remitted whoever sins you retain they're
[1:08:06] retained that's in the Bible brother R
[1:08:08] couldn't come and bring anything outside
[1:08:10] the Bible it was already in
[1:08:14] scripture so now the Holy Ghost has got
[1:08:16] to have something to work with that's
[1:08:18] why you and I have got to get rid of the
[1:08:19] false Doctrine I believe we have but we
[1:08:22] need to see keep working on what
[1:08:24] Christlike nature
[1:08:26] that's why we're heading to let the life
[1:08:29] do
[1:08:31] it said I never let us say the great
[1:08:34] dummy teach me I bet somebody was saying
[1:08:35] that in his in their mind and he picked
[1:08:37] that up and said that and I bet could
[1:08:39] you imagine somebody be sitting there
[1:08:41] and thinking all that he all he just
[1:08:42] verba them tells you what you're
[1:08:44] thinking yeah you know he stood there
[1:08:46] one day and he said watch it he said I
[1:08:48] know what you're
[1:08:49] thinking good grief could you imagine no
[1:08:52] wonder he was only one man that could
[1:08:53] stand it I'd go crazy
[1:08:56] he said he have to pinch yourself to see
[1:08:58] if he was in this world or the
[1:09:00] next sometimes I have to do that but
[1:09:02] it's not because of
[1:09:04] that is this really where I'm
[1:09:07] at so the transition to Perfection has
[1:09:09] begun just a few
[1:09:11] minutes so after the burst pains comes
[1:09:13] instead of going on with the word they
[1:09:15] got a bunch of men together just like
[1:09:16] the first one did that's exactly right
[1:09:19] after the rocking of the apostles then
[1:09:21] we find her going off again like um ni
[1:09:25] all those different things then we find
[1:09:27] out Along come many of the others agabus
[1:09:29] and many of the Great reformers back in
[1:09:31] the beginning each age had done as you
[1:09:33] study the prena council the Nia fathers
[1:09:36] and all back you find it all in there
[1:09:38] each age was rocked every time a
[1:09:40] messenger came forth he had thus sayith
[1:09:42] the Lord now she is in the worst stage
[1:09:45] that according to scripture she's ever
[1:09:50] been we are in the leoty and church age
[1:09:52] a rich but blinded Church age that don't
[1:09:55] know
[1:09:56] it there wasn't nowhere in the Bible
[1:09:59] that Christ was ever put out of the
[1:10:00] church but the lay out of see and age
[1:10:02] she's in the worst age she's the
[1:10:03] rottenest she's ever was I said as a
[1:10:06] queen and have need of nothing and don't
[1:10:08] you know that you're naked miserable
[1:10:10] blind poor and don't know it yes sir I
[1:10:12] counsel thee to come in by Isa this
[1:10:14] message is the
[1:10:18] isaf the word of God preached through
[1:10:20] lips of clay anointed by God Is Isa
[1:10:25] amen that I might open your eyes the
[1:10:28] eyes myself of God will certainly bring
[1:10:30] light to the church if it wants to open
[1:10:33] his
[1:10:34] eyes to what God has said notice quickly
[1:10:37] now she's in that stage beyond a shadow
[1:10:39] of a doubt we're in the Le ofan Church
[1:10:41] age now our messenger is Promised in
[1:10:43] Malachi 4th the 4th chapter he's
[1:10:46] promised to do it and the message is to
[1:10:48] bring back the word all right bring it
[1:10:50] back bring the people back to the word
[1:10:56] Pentecost partially did that they didn't
[1:10:58] come to forward though they come to a
[1:10:59] certain
[1:11:01] place or the Holy Ghost wouldn't fail
[1:11:05] itself right birth is to be she's to be
[1:11:08] delivered of a new birth from According
[1:11:11] to Malachi 4 now I've heard this
[1:11:13] preached many many times by people in
[1:11:15] the message one
[1:11:17] particularly that this is the new birth
[1:11:20] that we have today is you always was
[1:11:23] eternal you always had that seed you was
[1:11:25] all this I mean you was they don't talk
[1:11:27] about predestination by for knowledge
[1:11:30] it's just that you come to a realization
[1:11:33] this is the new birth from According to
[1:11:34] Malachi 4 you can't change the
[1:11:37] Bible brother brandham never said that
[1:11:40] brother brandham is not meaning that
[1:11:42] right that it's a new New
[1:11:44] Birth am it's a new birth from According
[1:11:47] in Malachi 4 because when you come to
[1:11:49] that Malachi for birth in the end time
[1:11:51] listen to me
[1:11:53] people you want accept false
[1:11:58] Doctrine now the new birth in the other
[1:12:00] ages God would wink at that ignorance
[1:12:03] and would accept he wouldn't accept
[1:12:05] false Doctrine he'd accept your
[1:12:07] sincerity for what was being brought at
[1:12:09] the time it was
[1:12:10] brought right thank God for Grace thank
[1:12:15] God for Grace with people Luther and
[1:12:16] Wesley and different ones and they'll
[1:12:17] thank God too because they made
[1:12:19] it but then you come over here in the
[1:12:22] end time word be delivered of a new
[1:12:24] birth from According to my for what do
[1:12:26] Malachi for to do
[1:12:27] restore that's right so we're to come to
[1:12:29] a new birth and when you get born again
[1:12:31] in this age you get born again in this
[1:12:34] age and you hear this message you got to
[1:12:36] come to it you got to come to it you
[1:12:39] can't deny it If you deny this message
[1:12:41] you're not born
[1:12:43] again amen that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:12:46] that's thus sayith the whole Bible
[1:12:47] That's thus sayith everybody in this
[1:12:49] building can say thus sayith the Lord
[1:12:51] you know brother Ram told us he said you
[1:12:52] you know the brid will have thus sayith
[1:12:54] the Lord as she'll sit step well we
[1:12:55] don't have to sit still
[1:12:57] anymore we have th sayth the Lord we
[1:13:00] know where the word is we know what it
[1:13:01] says we know how to get
[1:13:03] it so we can say thus says the Lord this
[1:13:06] is what it is this message is exactly
[1:13:07] the truth come straight from God to me
[1:13:11] if it come to you that's fine became
[1:13:12] straight to
[1:13:14] me in the church world today there's two
[1:13:16] systems working I want you to see if
[1:13:19] you're going to say Amen on this why one
[1:13:21] of the systems was set both systems were
[1:13:23] sitting in his congregation at the time
[1:13:26] there's two systems working in the
[1:13:27] church world today I'm going to get this
[1:13:29] off my shoulder then I have to then have
[1:13:31] it over with we all know that that's the
[1:13:34] word of God and the denominational
[1:13:36] system there's your two systems
[1:13:38] denominational world word of God there's
[1:13:41] two systems at work just like Jacob and
[1:13:43] Esau just like who Judas and and Jesus
[1:13:47] and the only
[1:13:48] way Jesus knew who Judas was is cuz he
[1:13:51] was the son of man he had discernment he
[1:13:54] knew who he was
[1:13:56] I hope that's simple enough that you can
[1:13:58] understand it now look he said these men
[1:14:01] brother Bob black brother Aron Roberts
[1:14:04] brother luiso different ones Brother
[1:14:06] Richard Douglas and all those different
[1:14:07] ones those
[1:14:09] men those men you are there that is that
[1:14:12] is your quote these men if they pick up
[1:14:15] this capital T that's the message and
[1:14:17] goes out with it they can make more
[1:14:19] sense to
[1:14:20] it I think he makes really good sense
[1:14:25] but he said we'd make more sense of it
[1:14:27] right I just want to lay this seed and
[1:14:29] then hope they make it come to life and
[1:14:32] I believe we've done
[1:14:34] it
[1:14:37] amen now remember he'll restore the
[1:14:40] truth as they had it and those elect
[1:14:42] with him in that day will be the ones
[1:14:43] who truly manifest the Lord and be his
[1:14:45] body talking about the Malachi 4 message
[1:14:48] all right truly manifest the Lord and be
[1:14:50] his body and be his
[1:14:52] voice be his voice
[1:14:55] Revelations
[1:14:56] 10 and perform his Works do you see it
[1:15:01] 1965 doing God a service now
[1:15:04] watch the Mysteries will be revealed in
[1:15:06] the last day now now listen Divine
[1:15:09] Healing is not a
[1:15:11] mystery it's been happening for since
[1:15:13] the dawn of time pretty much everybody
[1:15:16] with me all right there's a mystery
[1:15:18] maybe how it happens but there's no
[1:15:20] mystery to it we have it it's in the
[1:15:22] atonement it's in the Bible it tells us
[1:15:26] the mystery will be revealed on the last
[1:15:27] day when the seven angels seventh
[1:15:29] Angel's message not when he starts out
[1:15:31] doing
[1:15:32] this but when he begins to sound his
[1:15:35] message see not in the years of
[1:15:38] preparation not the bait on the hook not
[1:15:41] the partial everybody with me not the
[1:15:44] Cornerstone zerubabel laid that building
[1:15:47] again he swept the foundation off he
[1:15:50] didn't he didn't destroy the foundation
[1:15:52] he built what was on there already he
[1:15:54] built it back all right Elijah didn't
[1:15:57] get another set of stones he built on
[1:15:59] that same Foundation that they tore
[1:16:03] down not not the years in preparation
[1:16:05] but when he begins to sound the message
[1:16:07] these Mysteries will be revealed and
[1:16:08] here they are boy what a prophet here
[1:16:11] they
[1:16:12] are not knowing them and you people are
[1:16:15] witness of
[1:16:18] that Paradox
[1:16:22] now this is what we won get to and then
[1:16:24] we'll close right here
[1:16:25] 1965 healing is the children's bread we
[1:16:28] realize that it's in the atonement and
[1:16:30] the atonement first is applied to our
[1:16:36] soul get people born
[1:16:42] again I think sometimes they and it's
[1:16:45] good that you go through a prayer line
[1:16:46] but most people go through a prayer line
[1:16:48] they want to be healed with
[1:16:50] something and healing has always forerun
[1:16:53] every message
[1:16:55] and it's been also been a means to
[1:16:58] gather people together remember Jesus
[1:16:59] started out Healing Ministry and then he
[1:17:01] started preaching word brother Brown
[1:17:02] started out Healing Ministry started
[1:17:04] preaching the word all right many people
[1:17:06] will sponsor a healing meeting many will
[1:17:08] come to a healing meeting or a song
[1:17:10] festival I don't know what he put that
[1:17:11] in there for but when it comes to a poor
[1:17:13] lost soul there's not many people
[1:17:15] interested interested in it that's the
[1:17:18] main thing though Divine Healing and
[1:17:19] singing festivals and so forth is just
[1:17:21] as brother Bosworth said it's de baate
[1:17:23] on the hook and you show the the fish to
[1:17:25] bait not the
[1:17:26] hook and it's just the thing to get the
[1:17:28] people to listen till he can really
[1:17:31] present to them your message God has did
[1:17:34] that in every age through every age
[1:17:36] there's always been a healing campaign
[1:17:38] you know what that angel rebuke brother
[1:17:40] brandom for trying to explain
[1:17:43] that you know what he's saying you're
[1:17:46] wasting your time that's right you can't
[1:17:49] teach
[1:17:51] Pentecostal babies Supernatural
[1:17:55] things and the Pentecostals thought they
[1:17:56] was the most Supernatural people in the
[1:17:58] world and God had left
[1:18:02] them God has did that in every age
[1:18:04] there's always been a healing campaign
[1:18:06] and if it's a genuine healing campaign
[1:18:08] behind that campaign always is a message
[1:18:10] there never is a sign given just for a
[1:18:12] sign it's forerunning a message and see
[1:18:15] you and I have picked that
[1:18:18] up then there's a
[1:18:21] message we love the he we love the
[1:18:23] healing part
[1:18:25] right but give me the
[1:18:29] message but when he begins to tell them
[1:18:32] the truth of the Gospel who he was and
[1:18:34] what he come for he's talking about
[1:18:35] Jesus he was not popular after that and
[1:18:39] that's the way it's always been through
[1:18:40] every age and it will continue that
[1:18:46] way when that church age is done
[1:18:48] denominated and become a church age when
[1:18:50] it's done in its Pentecostal
[1:18:52] organization when the messenger to that
[1:18:55] what was each messenger what was Martin
[1:18:57] Luther a rebuke to the Catholic what was
[1:18:59] Wesley rebuke to the Lutheran Pentecost
[1:19:01] rebuke to the others where has the life
[1:19:04] gone now away from an organization no
[1:19:06] more shook it had to come back to the
[1:19:10] grain what is it a rebuke to the
[1:19:12] Pentecostals to fulfill the scripture of
[1:19:14] this hour notice the very day when this
[1:19:16] message not when he starts on but when
[1:19:18] he begins to declare his message you see
[1:19:22] the first pull was healing that started
[1:19:24] today out second pull was telling them
[1:19:27] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:19:28] but now remember you got to carry that
[1:19:30] on to where brother brandham was
[1:19:32] starting to preach his
[1:19:34] message all right he was starting to
[1:19:36] discern what they needed and give it to
[1:19:39] them third pull opening of the word the
[1:19:41] Myster is revealed so the first pull was
[1:19:44] healing second pull was that
[1:19:45] intermediate part and then the opening
[1:19:47] of the word the seals the mystery was
[1:19:48] revealed there's no more higher order to
[1:19:50] reveal the word than Prophets The Only
[1:19:52] Way the prophet can be Vindicated is by
[1:19:54] the word remember the third pole was the
[1:19:56] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[1:19:58] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[1:20:00] the word of
[1:20:02] God real quick right here all right now
[1:20:05] we're trying to place the Revival now
[1:20:06] watch this what year is this
[1:20:10] 1959 now listen here's a prophet 1959
[1:20:13] he's been on the scene now since what 19
[1:20:16] 48 40 48 and that when everything
[1:20:19] started 47 48
[1:20:21] 47 47
[1:20:27] 12
[1:20:28] years 12 years he's been on the field 12
[1:20:32] years
[1:20:34] watch now we're trying to place the
[1:20:36] Revival just in the best setting that we
[1:20:38] can we do not what we call major on
[1:20:41] Divine Healing he's been preaching for
[1:20:42] 12 years because Divine Healing is a
[1:20:46] minor all right and you cannot major on
[1:20:50] a minor we know that so the great thing
[1:20:52] that we're after for any Revival is to
[1:20:55] bring lost souls to Christ first now
[1:20:57] watch He's put four things in here bring
[1:21:00] lost souls to Christ
[1:21:03] first if you bring somebody to Christ
[1:21:05] first and get them born again you ain't
[1:21:07] got to tell them the message is
[1:21:10] Right you've done your job it's God's
[1:21:13] job through the Holy Ghost Inside of
[1:21:14] them to take them right
[1:21:17] through you don't have to tell the Holy
[1:21:19] Ghost filled person to come to church
[1:21:21] that's why you get them born again you
[1:21:22] don't have to worry about preaching
[1:21:23] about people not coming to church
[1:21:27] it's the lost souls and that's the first
[1:21:28] thing revive the church back into a
[1:21:30] spiritual condition number two to where
[1:21:32] it should be close communion with God
[1:21:36] bring Fellowship among the churches
[1:21:38] that's not happening too much third and
[1:21:41] fourth pray for the sick last thing pray
[1:21:43] for the sick that's our aim our try
[1:21:46] Sinners first fellowship and with the
[1:21:48] churches a close walk with the church to
[1:21:51] God and then pray for the sick now
[1:21:53] that's the way it's lined up all
[1:21:56] right sin is on the Rampage worse than
[1:21:58] it ever was and moved right into the
[1:22:00] locks of the church and has tore it up
[1:22:03] what did our miracles do now watch this
[1:22:05] is
[1:22:06] 1959 same thing 12 years after he's been
[1:22:09] on a 12E healing campaign at this moment
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] here sin is on the Rampage worse than it
[1:22:17] ever was and moved right into the locks
[1:22:20] of the church and has tore it up what
[1:22:22] did our miracles do he's asking a
[1:22:25] question what did our healing campaigns
[1:22:28] question mark I believe in Divine
[1:22:30] Healing sure but you can never major on
[1:22:33] a
[1:22:34] minor Divine Healing is a minor we could
[1:22:37] never major on those
[1:22:40] things the church ought to be to
[1:22:44] maturity
[1:22:45] 1959
[1:22:48] 1959 and we've had rushing winds and
[1:22:50] we've had all kind of sensation where's
[1:22:52] the church at where are we at today I
[1:22:55] ask the same question to us still more
[1:22:58] denominations growing every day and
[1:23:00] colonizing and everything and still the
[1:23:03] same
[1:23:04] men evidence of the Resurrection
[1:23:09] 1958 what's the matter today you can
[1:23:11] preach repentance and hellfire Brimstone
[1:23:13] people laugh at it what's the matter our
[1:23:16] hearts are cold we are indifferent we've
[1:23:19] got too much we need less of the world
[1:23:21] and more of God our hearts are too cold
[1:23:24] we become interested in some emotion
[1:23:29] oh one more time we become interested in
[1:23:32] some emotion we become interested if we
[1:23:35] can dance now watch now watch if we can
[1:23:38] shout I believe in it we believe in all
[1:23:40] that too amen but you better get the
[1:23:43] word first you get the word first
[1:23:44] everything else goes in
[1:23:46] line if we can speak with tongues I
[1:23:49] believe in it I believe in every bit of
[1:23:51] that but if we have that and don't have
[1:23:54] have that agonizing weeping brokeup
[1:23:56] Spirit God can never use it them things
[1:24:00] are good but we got to have the other to
[1:24:02] go with it we've left off now
[1:24:06] watch we've left off the main
[1:24:11] thing and gone for secondary you see it
[1:24:15] in the message now too brothers and
[1:24:16] sisters oh yeah they've left off the
[1:24:19] teaching part they've left off trying to
[1:24:20] grow in God and they went to the
[1:24:22] secondary
[1:24:25] and you can never major on a minor we
[1:24:27] know that identified Christ of all ages
[1:24:30] 1964 let's get one after the seals and
[1:24:32] then we'll close now in this we do not
[1:24:34] try to say we major in Divine Healing
[1:24:37] because Divine Healing is a minor
[1:24:39] everybody understand what a minor and
[1:24:40] major is a minor is you can't become
[1:24:44] perfected minor is
[1:24:47] partial everybody with me minor is
[1:24:50] partial major is
[1:24:53] perfect so so you can never now he said
[1:24:55] never he said never 10 times you can
[1:24:58] never major on a minor but now watch but
[1:25:02] about 86% I think it's estimated of
[1:25:05] Jesus's Ministry was on Divine
[1:25:08] Healing right as Dr Bosworth used to say
[1:25:12] one of my associates went on to Glory a
[1:25:13] few years ago Divine Healing is the bait
[1:25:16] that's on the fish hook and you never
[1:25:18] show the fish the hook you show him the
[1:25:19] bait so he takes the bait and gets the
[1:25:21] hook the problem is sometimes when we go
[1:25:24] fish Mission I know me and brother Danny
[1:25:25] we have fed a lot of fish that never
[1:25:27] took the
[1:25:28] hook cuz we didn't put the we didn't put
[1:25:31] the worm on right maybe sometimes we
[1:25:34] ain't put the worm on right and catch
[1:25:35] fish I'm talking about in this
[1:25:38] message we want to catch the fish for
[1:25:41] the Lord's Glory catch them out of the
[1:25:43] world and bring them to the kingdom of
[1:25:45] God now watch read this right here and
[1:25:47] then we'll quit musicians come on So
[1:25:49] Divine Healing the main thing is Divine
[1:25:52] Healing of the Soul right the body of
[1:25:55] Christ it needs healing worse than
[1:25:58] anything that I know is the body of
[1:26:02] Christ it's been so broken up by men's
[1:26:05] Theology and denominational differences
[1:26:07] until it's a sick body I tell you it
[1:26:11] needs healing great
[1:26:13] healing now a gift like I said a gift is
[1:26:16] wonderful let's stand but you can't base
[1:26:18] your Eternal destination on
[1:26:22] gifts you cannot make on a minor and a
[1:26:26] gift is a
[1:26:27] minor and Satan can impersonate any gift
[1:26:31] God's
[1:26:32] got and he can make something just
[1:26:34] exactly like
[1:26:37] it but listen he can't put the word
[1:26:39] together he hates the word therefore we
[1:26:43] got to watch that he's seen demons shout
[1:26:46] speaking tongues same thing they do
[1:26:48] about Divine Healing they say well it's
[1:26:50] a hoca Pocus or something like it isn't
[1:26:52] it's genuine unadulterated faith in what
[1:26:54] God Said is the truth and that anchors
[1:26:56] and when it anchors there's nothing
[1:26:57] going to move it
[1:27:01] am now
[1:27:03] here's here's my stopping point right
[1:27:06] here brother R tells us in birth pains
[1:27:08] he said that's the same thing in the New
[1:27:10] Birth we never go back but we go forward
[1:27:13] when we're born again and that's why I
[1:27:15] think today we have so
[1:27:19] many so
[1:27:21] many not so many rather
[1:27:24] genuine new births
[1:27:27] amen because it's built on an emotion
[1:27:29] it's built on shouting it's built on
[1:27:31] going through a prayer line it's built
[1:27:32] on brother so and so told me I had it
[1:27:35] you going to be left
[1:27:38] behind but you get the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:40] he'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:27:41] truth he promised amen that's why I
[1:27:43] think today we have so many not so many
[1:27:45] rather genuine new births it's because
[1:27:47] the seed is maybe will
[1:27:51] sympathize with the word God is not a
[1:27:55] sympathizer Satan is a
[1:27:58] sympathizer will sympathize with the
[1:28:00] word or the person if my favorite
[1:28:03] preacher preaches I'll get
[1:28:05] something but they don't want to rot
[1:28:07] away from the old system that they were
[1:28:10] in
[1:28:13] amen and as I said again where's the new
[1:28:16] birth according to Malachi 4 it's not
[1:28:18] made in a prayer
[1:28:21] line right it could start but I thought
[1:28:25] we believe in justification
[1:28:26] sanctification baptism the Holy
[1:28:28] Ghost it's not getting healed to
[1:28:31] cancer though that's
[1:28:33] wonderful it's a healing of your
[1:28:36] soul be taught right the two systems
[1:28:39] they pull this whole thing
[1:28:41] apart and here we
[1:28:43] are standing here today we're trying to
[1:28:46] get ready to go in
[1:28:48] rapture we can't have
[1:28:51] minor we can't have minor minor can
[1:28:54] start Minor's okay but don't measure on
[1:28:57] that
[1:28:59] minor healing healing if I see healing I
[1:29:01] can get born again if I see that person
[1:29:03] or or if my favorite preacher says I'm
[1:29:05] Healed or says I'm born again you better
[1:29:07] watch
[1:29:08] it Satan can impersonate every gift that
[1:29:11] God has except the word of God being
[1:29:14] born in your soul Satan can't do that
[1:29:17] right God bless you let's sing a song
[1:29:20] Let's be wary let's be
[1:29:22] sensitive to what's going on right
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:27] now when
[1:29:29] noach shall
[1:29:31] come no more
[1:29:34] clouds in the
[1:29:36] sky No More Tears to dim the eye all is
[1:29:43] peace forever
[1:29:46] more on that
[1:29:48] high Golden
[1:29:50] Shore what
[1:29:53] day glorious
[1:29:55] day that will be sing it to
[1:29:59] me oh what a
[1:30:02] day that will
[1:30:04] be when my
[1:30:07] Jesus I shall
[1:30:09] see when I look upon his face the one
[1:30:15] who saved me by his
[1:30:18] grace when he takes me by the hand leads
[1:30:24] me through the promised
[1:30:27] land what a day glorious
[1:30:32] day that will
[1:30:39] be sorrow there no more
[1:30:44] bird to bear no more
[1:30:48] sickness no pain no more part
[1:30:54] over
[1:30:55] there and
[1:30:57] forever I will be with the one who died
[1:31:03] for
[1:31:04] me what a
[1:31:06] day glorious
[1:31:09] day that will
[1:31:13] be oh what a
[1:31:15] day that will
[1:31:18] be when my
[1:31:20] Jesus I shall
[1:31:22] see when I I look upon his face the one
[1:31:28] who Sav Me by his grace when he takes me
[1:31:34] by the hand and leads me through the
[1:31:39] promised land what a
[1:31:42] day glorious
[1:31:45] day that will be
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:59] but make sure our soul is healed make
[1:32:02] sure we got the new birth and then ask
[1:32:05] God say look God I don't have to go
[1:32:06] through a prayer
[1:32:08] line I can just say it I'm a
[1:32:11] gentile the Gentile way is not a prayer
[1:32:14] line
[1:32:16] Sorry even brother R tells many times
[1:32:18] laying on the hands of Methodist
[1:32:19] tradition call to the altar Methodist
[1:32:22] tradition what did the Gentile tell
[1:32:25] Jesus you just speak the word I'm of
[1:32:28] authority and you're of authority I tell
[1:32:30] people to go and come you tell people to
[1:32:32] go and come you know what he was saying
[1:32:33] I know you got authority over demons and
[1:32:36] there's a demon on my
[1:32:38] servant and as I'm coming to you as a
[1:32:41] somebody that has Authority and I can
[1:32:43] tell these men to kill you if they want
[1:32:45] to if I want them to he said you just
[1:32:47] speak the word and you know what Jesus
[1:32:49] said he said as you spoke it'll be done
[1:32:53] and we know that the very hour that they
[1:32:55] came running and said hey that's that's
[1:32:57] the best way to do
[1:32:59] it because you know why I'll promise you
[1:33:02] that dude that was in the I call him a
[1:33:03] dude that guy that was sitting in the in
[1:33:05] the house that whatever was wrong with
[1:33:07] him he's probably agonizing I mean he
[1:33:10] just and all of a sudden he didn't need
[1:33:13] a tape
[1:33:15] plate
[1:33:18] right he didn't need a preacher to shake
[1:33:22] him he would just lay in there and he
[1:33:24] had somebody of authority to speak for
[1:33:27] him
[1:33:28] amen and he just accepted the gift and I
[1:33:31] bet you when it happened he's like what
[1:33:33] in the world went
[1:33:36] on I've had that done one time I've been
[1:33:39] healed of something and and you're like
[1:33:41] and it shocks you shouldn't shock us but
[1:33:45] it does shock you because you're not
[1:33:47] expecting it maybe sometimes you're not
[1:33:49] even under the atmosphere of of an
[1:33:51] anointing that's like now an anointing
[1:33:53] that's going back and forth through the
[1:33:54] church you might be out there working
[1:33:56] somewhere you know brother Dale the
[1:33:58] greatest messages he preached he was
[1:34:00] working 40 to 50 hours a week at General
[1:34:03] Motors and he was writing notes on a
[1:34:05] piece of paper that was supposed to be
[1:34:07] for a job he'd write notes and stick
[1:34:09] them in his pocket that was God coming
[1:34:11] to him amen sometimes we think we have
[1:34:13] to have an atmosphere sure and it's good
[1:34:15] to have one amen love to feel the
[1:34:18] presence of the Lord but I sure like to
[1:34:19] feel him when I'm sitting down somewhere
[1:34:21] under a tree somewhere or sitting
[1:34:23] somewhere in the house and God just
[1:34:25] drops down and to me that's Sovereign
[1:34:28] brother Bob and that to me that's
[1:34:30] intimate that's intimate I'm the only
[1:34:33] one
[1:34:34] there and maybe I got maybe somebody's
[1:34:36] praying for me that's okay but at that
[1:34:38] time in that moment he just drops right
[1:34:40] down and he just gives you something
[1:34:44] that's the special part of God I mean he
[1:34:46] can do that while he's doing it to you I
[1:34:48] ain't special he do it to you too let
[1:34:50] him drop down and I've had him drop down
[1:34:52] in a car one time I was driving a a a a
[1:34:54] little small S10 white S10 back from we
[1:34:57] were we were building my house and I was
[1:35:00] listening to the radio and I was asking
[1:35:03] God about something and the atmosphere
[1:35:05] got so real inside that till I looked
[1:35:08] over to see if there was somebody
[1:35:09] sitting there and you know what I did I
[1:35:11] had a hat on and when I did I slung that
[1:35:13] thing off I said God if you're here I
[1:35:16] said this is what I
[1:35:18] need and he gave it to
[1:35:20] me but I throw that hat off I knew there
[1:35:23] was a Pres there that had not been there
[1:35:26] before but I've also been riding down
[1:35:28] the road and think the devil's sitting
[1:35:30] beside of me so don't get me wrong we
[1:35:32] we're not we're not always on the cloud
[1:35:34] by oursel either the devil's there or
[1:35:36] God's there one of the two but when the
[1:35:39] listen when the presence of God Comes
[1:35:41] The Devil can't stand it he leaves he
[1:35:44] can't stand being that
[1:35:46] close I'm going say this before we leave
[1:35:49] now listen look how special we are
[1:35:53] right look how special we are cuz Satan
[1:35:57] can talk to God anytime he wants
[1:36:00] to walk right up to him and talk to him
[1:36:03] but when you and I are
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:08] involved Satan hates that he can sit
