TRANSCRIPT
========================================
blessing to Sayer be with us sick brother Mike also brother collie down in his back lord and all the ones Lord to have unspoken requests we all have needs and we're just coming down and bless us today forgive us for all of our sins Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you thanks good to be in the house of the Lord beautiful day I love this fall weather it's good to be a Christian oh God we're so grateful to be able to gather together with you today Lord and we just ask the Lord that you'll come in Among Us this morning Lord Jesus and open up these scriptures Lord as we study these things out Lord bless us bless brother Wade as he's prepared and bless our hearts Lord Jesus and help us Lord to be prepared to receive Lord in your name amen in Hebrews where where uh I keep saying we're almost to chapter 10. we really are um we're uh so Hebrews chapter 9 verse 21 just to kind of to talk about that for a few moments this morning it says moreover he sprinkled with blood both a tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there's no remission you can't have remission without blood brother Brown would say and the law of having a shadow back in 1954 he said if a man lives good enough if a man lives good enough he'd be God himself if he could live good enough I said look life lies in the blood cell and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin innocent substitute has to take a guilty Sinner's place oh I want you to get this now notice an innocent substitute must take the guilty one's place and it happened in Eden that same way that when Adam sinned he cut off his fellowship with God the father and when he had sinned before he could stand before God God had to kill some sheep perhaps whatever it was and make it covering blood had to be offered in substance because the Bloods were life laid and God required life as Sin so it ain't how good you live is how good God Lives God is the one that it's God's life that paid the price and the water of Separation in 1955 brother and said now God telling Moses and Aaron as he was the prophet and priest Moses the prophet Heir and the priest he said now I want you to go out and get a heifer a young heifer which is all one color one complete color red we always think looks of the red is danger red does signify danger or a life or so forth but red in the scripture signifies Redemption through the blood Rahab which he put the Scarlet streak down and all through the Bible is the Scarlet Street Redemption comes through red to the shedding of the blood and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and how that God said go get this heifer this red all over not one spot of anything else but perfectly red for God looked through red and you know what color red is looking through red red through red makes white try it one time red through red produces White so when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ to we who are Scarlet Red with sin and covered by the blood he sees us white as snow though your sins be red like Crimson they shall be white like snow in the water of Separation he said God looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed you're redeemed because he's always sees you through Christ that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect in the sense of sinless we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ not not perfect in the sense if you're not going to make any mistakes through your your Christian Journey but perfect in the sense that God's looking through at you through his blood now foreign that's the reason he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews trying to explain the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things can never make the come around too perfect because God was looking through animal blood but now he looks through the blood of his son Perfection come by Jesus Christ and the message Fellowship brother Brown said then that's Eleazar after killing the heifer burning her while she was bleeding he made a public testimony dipping his fingers and striping seven times over the door that's seven times if we had time to go into it represents the seven Church Ages Every age every person every time must recognize the blood for without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin then before you could come into Fellowship he had to look up and recognize that something died in his Stead and went on before him he said in the message Fellowship every man today no matter how many churches you join how many pages you turn you've got to recognize that Christ died in your stead and went on before you making a way and through his blood you are a Sanctified vessel unto the Lord not your sanctification not laying in something you did but his sanctification through him who gave himself for us died in our stead let that Faith go to work down in the heart one time and watch what takes place now there's there's something to meditate on let that go to work in your heart one time and watch what takes place that it's not something you have to do but just believe in Jesus Christ that he's looking at you through the blood all of you you don't have to take some man's Theory you got the word that's right now in the Bible if we if we kind of meditate on this further if we go back in a little bit because chapter four and in Leviticus chapter four is where if you want to study that out a little bit further is where over and over he repeats the process if the priest has done anything wrong if the whole congregation has done anything wrong if the individual has done anything wrong if they've committed a sin of ignorance then blood will be offered and it goes through how that the sacrifice is offered and they you lay your hands on that sacrifice when the blood is sprinkled seven times because you're you're having confidence in faith that you're you're trans and what you're actually doing is transferring your sin to that animal to that innocent animal and you're taking the innocence of that animal and transferring it to you and now in the New Testament you're taking your your sin and transferring it to Christ and his innocence is transferred back to you know you think how powerful that is that's that's something real now Leviticus chapter 4 if we just meditate on this scripture and go back and it says in the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying if a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord you know you think about our sin of ignorance you didn't know nothing you were ignorant about the gospel until you heard the word preached and even sometimes you hear you hear the word priest wrong and and so you're ignorant of the way that it's really preached but then your eyes have been light your eyes become enlightened and open and you realize that you've done you've done something wrong and you were ignorant before but now you realize your guilt is and and plain plainly displayed before you and so you come you come with your sacrifice like they did in the Old Testament you come and you lay your hands on that sacrifice because you were ignorant before but now you realize what what what position you're in if a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done and shall do against any of them if the priest that is Anointed due sin according to the sin of the people then let him bring for his sin which he hath sinned a young bullet without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering it's got to be without blemish but because he's you're he's transferring his innocence to you and he shall bring the Bullock under the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and kill the bullet before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed shall take of the Bullock's blood and bring it to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord and before the veil of the sanctuary seven times because speaking now just like every everything in the Old Testament is a type many things of the in the Old Testament are a type of the of the reality that we're living under now that now we're living under each Church age is sprinkled under the blood of Christ and every everyone that comes to Christ has to come but with faith and what Christ has done for us by shedding his blood and if you go down to Leviticus chapter 4 4 he he talks about the congregation of the whole Congregation of the with the whole Congregation of Israel's sin through ignorance and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly and they have done to see if it's hidden from you you don't know but when the gospel is preached when the message is preached then your ignorance is taken away and you realize and they have done somewhat against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done and are guilty when the sin which they have sinned against it is known then the congregation shall offer a young bullet for the sin and bring him before the Tabernacle of the congregation and the Elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the Bullock before the Lord you've got to be identified with it you gotta you put your hands on it except you put your hands on it except that that and sacrifice is dying for you that it's not just some ritual or something but that you're involved in it and the Bullock shall be killed before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed shall bring of the Bullock's blood to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall dip his finger and some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord even before the Veil and and the priest shall dip his finger and some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord even before the veil and he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord that is in the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering which is at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation you know many times they they stumble at what the horns of the altar meant they did they couldn't find it until one day they they uncovered a an altar that had been buried or or lost for a while and there was these things on the on the corner and you know that in the scripture talks about many times they would grab old to the horns of the altar when they got desperate you ever get into a place like that where you really get desperate that God would forgive you and that God would change change your life he put something on the altar you can grab onto and he shall take all his fat from him and burn it upon the Altar and he shall do with the Bullock as he did with the Bullock for a sin offering so shall he do with this and the priest shall make an atonement for them now here's the main the main punch line the main kicker and it shall be forgiven them when you come and you've done everything that God's required and you put your faith do you put your put your faith towards he is atoning sacrifice your sins are forgiven they're gone and you don't have to you thank God this morning you don't have to come drag a lamb into the church this morning or kill it outside but all you've got to do is put Faith put your faith in in Jesus Christ accepting that he died for you so John first in first John chapter one he said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanse us from all sin now there's a scripture that you can hang on to because that means he cleanses you from every sin no matter what you've done no matter what and and we'll you could unroll The Scroll of all the most heinous crimes murderer molester whatever it is all covered in this scripture that he cleanses you from all sin he can take all of that sin away all the if you've murdered your brother if you if you if you back talked if you if you've gossiped if you if you've lied if you lie to your parents if you lie to your children confess it to Jesus Christ and it'll all be taken care of because his blood you gotta you gotta go through the the the process though you can't just just say ignore it you got to put your hands on that put your hands on that sacrifice accept what Christ has done and that's what uh Charles Spurgeon was saying when he preached the sermon he said has it suddenly come to the knowledge the knowledge of your sin of ignorance the knowledge of any person here that he has sinned as he thought he had not sinned as some fresh Light broken in upon you and revealed to you your Darkness did you come to this house depressed in spirit because you have discovered that you are guilty and must perish unless the mercy of God prevent you then Come Ye common people who have discovered your sin and bring your sacrifice and they get us here already for you come and accept the sacrifice which God provides and let your sin be forever put away brother I'm sitting and identify with Christ he said in the Old Testament when a man wants to be identified at the house of God he took the most innocent thing he could find a lamb and he know the lamb was free from sin because it know no sin and he went and took the lamb and put his hand upon his head and confessed his sin and by faith he transferred his sins on the lamb and the innocence of the Lamb back on him now there's there's kind of the gist of this now to think about this is to meditate on this morning that you can your sins will be true everything you've done all of your past will be transferred to Christ and his innocence will be transferred back to you if you believe it and then the lamb died because it was a sinner and the man lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what God Said but what did he do we went right back out of the temple with the same desire he had when he come in because when that blood cell is broken which the Life Starts in one blood cell and when that blood cell was broken the life of the Lamb would not coincide or come back into the human life because it was an animal life the man went out with the same desire he had so therefore he committed sins continually all the time again but there come a time when God made us an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus and when a sinner puts his hands upon his precious head and confesses his sins and his sin is transformed or transferred from The Sinner to Jesus and the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost back into that person he's a new creature in Christ Jesus that's where I want to be identified the Bible said he knowing no sin was made sin for us the reason he suffered was for our sins and it's no more than what is right no more than our duties to look at these things and see that these desires that we have that God put in us to create in us to make us to want to be like him yeah I I hope maybe this this morning as you as we meditate on these scriptures you can see the effect of the blood that the effect of the blood as it takes away the sin curse it will take it blots out all of your past but it also will transform your life to make you have new desires to make you want to be more like Christ to make you begin to walk in his footsteps so that that same life is Manifest in you so that the essence of the Old Testament law is fulfilled in your life because you're changed no you got that you got that that blood covering where Christ when you make a mistake you get back up again because Christ is looking at you through the blood but it's changing your life all the while and if God be with us then where is all the Miracles that brother said he was God of the Old Testament he was God of the New Testament he's the same God today yesterday today and forever and you know then down in your heart that a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being when you once drank and smoked and lied and you women loved the world so much you kept wearing your makeup and your long or short hair and doing other things you did and you find out that something happens and all the devils in Hell couldn't make you do it again something happened a miracle was performed what did he do changed your vile heart changed your desires changed your nature a supernatural word by Supernatural God made a creature of time to a creature of Eternity took the world out of you and put Christ in you the hope of glory and you're filled with his spirit and ready to meet him so that's what Paul is talking about when he said it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these I made a change last night and it's not here anyway what was that mean it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these sometimes it's a little bit hard to understand what Paul's point is with these These Old Testament sacrifices of an animal but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these with the sacrifice of Christ himself these are purified with these but these These are purified with the sacrifice of Christ for Christ is not entered into the holy Place made with hands which other figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entered into entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world have he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto man wants to die but after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation you notice how how everything that Paul says is just packed it's like a little sermon unto itself could you imagine listening to to Paul speak these words and I'm sure many of them pondered about what what do you mean shall he appear the second time and now we can look plainly back back through time and and understand these things now if we if we kind of break this down in all the different Bible translations the Aramaic Bible in plain English says in this way also the Messiah was offered one time and he slaughtered in his person the sins of the many but the second time he appears without our sins for the life of those who expect him so the first time Christ comes and is manifested in the flesh this is the son of man he come to pay for the price for our sins but the next time he's coming to get you and to bring you to himself in the way my new testament it says so the Christ also having been once offered and sacrificed in order that he might bear the sins of many will appear a second time separated from sin to those who are eagerly expecting him to make their salvation complete to make their salvation complete in other words not to just die for your sins and and to and to put into the mouths of the disciples the ability to preach the salvation of your soul but to bring full Redemption when Christ comes the second time he's gonna he's gonna make your salvation complete so that you can take a body change a new revised standard version that says so Christ having been offered wants to Bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him but let's go back to what Paul said so Christ was once offered to Bear their sins of many and unto them that looked for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation and brother man will say who's he going to appear to those that are looking for him he said now why didn't he said why didn't he do those signs for the Gentiles it never was performed for him by him why Gentiles wasn't looking for no Messiah they were heathens we were our people Romans and so forth back there with a club on their back worshiping Idols they wasn't looking for no Messiah and Messiah only comes to those who are looking for him that's the only way to them that look for him will he appear the second time just those who are looking for him not just to who pertaining but those who are really looking for him and notice he never come to Gentile that that miracle was never performed before Gentile and the unchangeable God now we've had 2 000 years of scholarship and all kinds of things and now it's come evening time and now the Gentiles are looking for a coming Messiah so before it was the Jews looking for looking for him and so he came to them and they rejected him but now the Gentiles are looking for him and so those are the ones that he comes to now if he's the same he appeared the same then to them two tribes he's got to appear the same way there and promise though and it is I Be not Afraid brotherbraham said now when Jesus was on Earth he declared himself to be the Messiah and John declared there was a messiah sign following him and the Old Testament claimed there be a messiah sign and he proved that Messiah signed to the people that he was the Messiah how they know he was a god prophet Moses the one that they had followed said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like and unto me we know that we're aware of that and amongst the Jews and Samaritans she showed this sign but of course he never amongst the Gentiles because we were heathens in those days our people were Gentiles Romans we wasn't looking for no Messiah and Messiah only appears to those looking for him that's the way those who wait for him he will appear the second time so it would behoove us tonight to be waiting for him and watching for him that we do not miss it when he comes and what was the Holy Ghost given for brother said I can hear the water splash Yonder on the Ohio River when I was a little boy oh boy preacher about 22 years old singing that there and I heard looked up above me and I Heard a Voice said look up here comes that big light hanging right Yonder Come moving down over me and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ you'll have a message that'll forerun the second coming of Christ all right so now we know we know what we're looking for that as John the Baptist four ran the first coming of Christ to die for our sins there would be another Forerunner to come to prepare the way for the second coming of Christ oh how could I believe it but it happened just the same and tonight Revival fires I love this court I used to read this quote when I was when I was young this is this is amazing tonight Revival fires are burning around and around the world the great Ransom Church of God lifted herself out of that place and great campaigns of healing and signs and wonders and miracles showing forth the coming and so you'll see his coming you'll see him if you're looking for him the second time so we can see now I know I know for a lot of us sitting here this morning this maybe this is a is is dialing things way back going back to the very Foundation but sometimes you know you never know who who who doesn't quite uh see see things so um we're we're just kind of go slowing down a little bit to tackle this now you look at this pattern now John the Baptist John the Baptist went out and and he he identified Jesus there in the water that's the coming of the son of man baptizing this is the one I'm not even murdered the unlatch his shoe and those kind of things here he's coming I'm going to baptize him and and that conversation when Jesus there in the water to introduce the son of man and then you've got brother Branham there in the water baptizing as as the voice says your message is going to full run just like John the Baptist did now you see that pattern is repeating so now now you know we've there's been a lot of confusion all down through the years of what we should be looking for and the people got their eyes on the messenger instead of the one that's coming but now I think we can see plainly if you're looking at what you're looking for you're looking for that for that gospel message to be preached that introduced that reveals this the son of man that reveals Christ in flesh again so John in chapter chapter 3 he said they came to John and said uh unto him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan to whom thou embarrassed witness behold the same baptizes and all men come to him John answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from Heaven ye yourselves bear me witnessed that I said I am not the cross but I am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom would standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled and it's in the in that same in the same way we're rejoicing at the bridegroom's voice that's even why you know they call it the voice of God the voice of God Recordings because we're hearing not the voice of a man but we're hearing the voice of God the message that we're hearing did not come from some man's idea but it's come straight from the Throne of God and we know that because it actually uh illuminates these scriptures that we've pondered at for so many years about Malachi 4 and and Luke 17 and Revelation 10 and and all of these scriptures that have been probed at in Ephesians 4 and 2nd Peter 1 and things that that even the nominations cannot can only can only can can just probe it so John said he must increase but I must decrease what's increasing increase the revelation of Jesus Christ in that day the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day as the messenger decreased the understanding the word the manifestation of Christ in the midst of his people increased so Jesus Jesus said in Matthew chapter 17 as the musicians come and we'll close on this I had a few more slides I was going to show you the uh how the Jews are looking for Elijah and Elijah Elijah always uh he he coincides what they're looking when they look for the Messiah the Jews are looking for Elijah too because they know when Elijah is going to come Messiah is coming so Matthew chapter 17 Jesus said when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man say Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead the second time and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already that seems like a perplexing thing to say that he's come already but he's going to come he's come already but he's looked for him to come and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist but he's speaking of this twofold coming of Elijah that's spoken of in Malachi 456 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now John the Baptist didn't come before a great and Dreadful day of the Lord not like that great and Dreadful means like the world is going to burn with a fervoth heat and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now here we got a two-fold coming of Elijah he shall turn the heart of the father in both of these he's got a the the the the the the understanding of the people had to be changed and I'm right at times so that they can be prepared for Christ to come on the scene he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the Old Testament fathers back to the new to the understanding of the to to receive Christ to the Pentecostal children in the heart of the children back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers lest he come and smite the Earth with a curse and I'm right at time so I gotta stop God bless you [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music]
