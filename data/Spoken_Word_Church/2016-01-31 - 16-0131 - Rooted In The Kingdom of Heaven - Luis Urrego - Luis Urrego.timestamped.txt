[2:04] Joe greens this morning stuff you
[2:06] remember him for Lord or just use him
[2:08] for his own in his court Amen let's all
[2:12] turn to Matthew chapter 13 Matthew 13 we
[2:20] know another brother brother Dale he's
[2:24] been speaking lately about the German
[2:26] not dermot eyes see germination and all
[2:30] those different types of things the seat
[2:32] on the fill in the rock and so in this I
[2:36] wanted to kind of still continue with
[2:39] that thought that brother Dale's been
[2:41] bringing we're just kind of in a
[2:44] different little angle and kind of
[2:46] taking somewhat over the weight if you
[2:49] were here Wednesday night talked about
[2:50] the anointing of you know anointed in
[2:54] the word Norton for a purpose right and
[2:57] finding yourself in the scripture which
[3:00] is very important in this hour because
[3:01] you know if you don't know where you are
[3:03] in the scripture if you don't know if
[3:06] you are not rooted and grounded in the
[3:08] word in any way shape or form you can't
[3:10] continue in this Christian life you have
[3:12] to be rooted and so that's why I want to
[3:14] talk about this morning it's about being
[3:16] routed into the Kingdom of Heaven being
[3:18] rooted in the kingdom of heaven and a
[3:21] while back I haven't preached this
[3:22] message here but a presa mess is called
[3:25] with no root no fruit and I'm this truth
[3:28] no root no fruit
[3:32] now priestess back oh I can brother Gene
[3:34] Williams church a couple of years ago in
[3:36] them and uh and maybe brother Dale he
[3:40] might touch he might touch on this later
[3:42] on because you know I go slowly and it
[3:45] kind of leaves you a question and doing
[3:47] your own study to which I love you know
[3:49] and I really appreciate brother Dale so
[3:51] much just pay your blessed woman they
[3:54] may have a husband like that that that
[3:56] shyt puts me to shame you know that I
[3:59] don't get into word like he does and so
[4:02] I god help us all right man because
[4:05] that's that takes you know getting into
[4:07] the word and studying and things like
[4:08] that it's also mentally it mentally uh
[4:11] you know even Paul said you know when
[4:13] you when you a lot of studying can be
[4:15] weirdness to you as well but that's a
[4:18] sacrifice that you're taking your
[4:20] persevering amen and there's going to be
[4:23] a blessing to come out of it whether
[4:24] it's for yourself or for somebody else a
[4:26] blessing won't come out of it because
[4:28] it's just work amen yeah excited that's
[4:38] good Amen because that's eight you ain't
[4:41] taking what you buy a walmart with you
[4:42] to heaven with thing this word with your
[4:47] anything I said you know a lot of
[4:48] printers discipline I've let them walk
[4:51] through walmart all day and i discern oh
[4:55] yeah some people some people then
[4:59] sometimes you look at billboards or
[5:01] things like that and get you a sermon
[5:02] you know and but it's good to be in the
[5:05] word Amen it's not just further pasture
[5:07] not just for the preachers for all of us
[5:09] to be in the word they meant good so
[5:12] Matthew chapter 13 we're just read here
[5:16] we'll start at verse verse 3 and it says
[5:21] and he spake many things unto them in
[5:24] parables saying behold a sower went
[5:27] forth to soap and when he sowed some
[5:30] seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls
[5:32] came and devoured them up verse 5 some
[5:36] fell upon stony places where they had
[5:39] not much
[5:40] earth and for with they sprung up
[5:43] because they had no deepness of birth
[5:45] and when the Sun was up they were
[5:48] scorched and because they had no root
[5:50] they withered away if you go down to
[5:53] verse 20 all the way to verse 20 of that
[5:55] same chapter it says and he ceases
[5:58] starting to explain that that parable he
[6:02] says but and he goes to the part where
[6:04] the one that fell on stony places he
[6:06] says but he that received the seed into
[6:09] stony places the same is he that feareth
[6:12] the word and anon with joy receives it
[6:15] yet has he no root in himself but do
[6:20] earth for a while for when tribulation
[6:22] or persecution arises because of the
[6:25] word by and by he is offended now Jesus
[6:28] here is speaking he's talking about this
[6:30] see it started to grow but it didn't
[6:33] have root to be able to make a
[6:36] foundation or two or to pull water and
[6:41] nutrients in order to continue grown
[6:43] amen and then if you read in mark
[6:46] chapter four you'll see that this Jesus
[6:48] speaks the same parable in mark chapter
[6:50] four you can read that now if you turn
[6:52] on me to Luke chapter eight Luke chapter
[6:56] eight
[7:08] in Luke chapter 8 in verse verse 6 we'll
[7:17] start at verse father says I saw her
[7:19] went out to sow his seed and he and as
[7:21] he sowed some fell by the wayside and it
[7:23] was trodden down and the fowls of the
[7:25] air devoured it and some fell upon a
[7:28] rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
[7:30] withered away because it lacked moisture
[7:34] so here on one on one animasi he says it
[7:38] then grow because it didn't have any
[7:40] route but then here in Luke he says it
[7:43] didn't grow because it didn't have any
[7:44] moisture so it didn't grow because of
[7:47] two different things no it grew do the
[7:50] same problem because roof is what grape
[7:54] is what grabs moisture in order for it
[7:56] to grow and if it doesn't have any route
[7:59] it's not gonna it's not gonna not going
[8:02] to grow its going to wither away so so
[8:08] brother but they'll have been speaking
[8:10] about dermot eyes see and there's also
[8:14] what's called germination of the sea now
[8:17] it kind of if you listen to brother
[8:20] Brennan speak and he speaks about the
[8:22] germ of life when he talks about dermot
[8:24] i seed and all in these types of things
[8:27] now Jaret I see you have to understand
[8:31] that when a seed when you're going to
[8:33] plant it on the ground first of all it
[8:35] has had to have gone through a process
[8:37] of pollination and all that basically a
[8:40] see what a seat is is kind of like what
[8:42] when the egg and a sperm joint together
[8:45] and we're all adults here some of us
[8:49] I'm gonna get out hard yeah there's
[8:53] nothing wrong with that it's good to
[8:56] love you know the Bible says you know
[8:58] love is a time for laughter time for
[9:00] sadness some people just stopped at the
[9:03] top for sadness and that's it it's good
[9:06] to laugh down Bob Vogel says laughter is
[9:08] like the mess you know we need left I
[9:11] mean we need to have a good time as well
[9:13] but sow a seed is kind of like a when a
[9:17] sperm and an egg join together it's a
[9:19] fertile fertilization starts to take
[9:21] place right there's an embryo that
[9:24] starts to you know starts to form but
[9:27] that is permanent that egg needs to be
[9:30] placed inside the proper environment
[9:31] right in the womb of a woman right in
[9:35] order for it to grow same thing with a
[9:37] seat now you have a seed that seed has
[9:41] life even though it's not showing it has
[9:45] life and that's what dermatitis means
[9:47] I'll see all life comes from God right
[9:51] we all know that so that scene even
[9:54] though it looks like it's dead and it's
[9:55] all hard and then it's got life within
[9:59] but you're not going to see the life
[10:01] coming forth until it is placed in the
[10:04] fray in the end the right of the right
[10:07] up in the atmosphere right in the ground
[10:10] now and so that's what dramatized means
[10:15] is that it has life already in it if you
[10:18] if you take a look at and I was kind of
[10:20] looking at this if you take a look
[10:21] inside a seated out it actually has a
[10:25] stem already inside of a little small
[10:27] stem little small stem with actually
[10:31] kind of like looks like little leaves
[10:33] already coming out from the sides but
[10:35] it's all inside its got some common
[10:39] units got endosperm and all these
[10:41] different little parts that are just
[10:43] dormant and they're just waiting to get
[10:46] into the right environment bringing in
[10:48] moisture as well in order for it to grow
[10:51] correct now when they when they are
[10:53] placed in the right environment and then
[10:56] little shoot starts to come up it's
[10:58] coming out of the sea that's what's
[11:01] called germination that's the
[11:03] germination process not on some of us
[11:06] some of us to get confused with there is
[11:08] a germination process but then that germ
[11:10] there that Dermot I see is the life
[11:13] that's already inside that seat that
[11:16] obviously our life comes from God right
[11:18] now when that seed is Dermot eyes that's
[11:22] why it's hard because it builds an outer
[11:25] and outer shell that it's protecting
[11:28] everything that's inside that outer
[11:30] shell that show us what that's why it's
[11:33] hard it protects everything inside and
[11:35] then when that germination process
[11:37] starts taking place that that little
[11:40] what's inside starts coming out and it
[11:42] breaks that outer shell and then if you
[11:45] continue to tune orchard nurture it it's
[11:48] going to grow any man let them watch
[11:50] your dad that's what the moisture does
[11:52] that's right one of the things that
[11:55] happens is that when it's in the right
[11:58] environment with moisture coming in
[12:01] because some people can take those seeds
[12:04] that are German ties to have life and
[12:06] they can actually grow them in a petri
[12:08] dish they can start the germination
[12:10] process without it being on Iran and
[12:13] they in the soil so you can take for
[12:16] example and I watch the video of a guy
[12:17] he was growing corn on a white plate and
[12:22] all he did was just put some put it in
[12:24] some water a little bit of water and put
[12:26] paper towel right over it to keep kind
[12:27] of keep the seed inside the water and it
[12:30] started growing its little sheets and
[12:32] that's where you get sprouts so
[12:34] germination is the same thing as
[12:36] sprouting if you'll feel to know that
[12:39] and and so you don't really necessarily
[12:43] need the soil in order for it to go now
[12:46] after the germination process then you
[12:48] can put it in the soil and that it can
[12:50] continue doing its thing so that's one
[12:52] of what Jesus is speaking here some of
[12:53] it fell on a rock there was a little bit
[12:56] of soul according to the scriptures that
[12:57] we worried here in Matthew there was a
[12:59] little bit of soil there but because it
[13:02] then have a root in order to continue
[13:05] grabbing that water
[13:07] it started the process of germination
[13:10] but it couldn't continue because it
[13:13] could didn't have the right environment
[13:15] in order to start start growing that
[13:17] route because once you put that German
[13:19] that German taught that germinated seed
[13:21] that's in that process of German ization
[13:23] in the ground what's one of the first
[13:27] things that starts coming up is starts
[13:29] growing that route in order for it to
[13:32] start pulling minerals and start pulling
[13:34] water amen so what am I getting with the
[13:37] Saints is that we need to be anchored we
[13:41] need to be rooted in the Word of God
[13:42] amen we need to know where we are in the
[13:46] scriptures because uh if you can know
[13:49] where you are in the word a man then
[13:52] you're not you're not going to be moved
[13:54] here you're going to be unmovable and
[13:57] you can be shaken a tree can be shaken
[14:00] maybe a little lamb here and there will
[14:03] fall other body forces of nature and
[14:05] things like that but i'ma tell you
[14:07] window when a tree is really rooted
[14:09] there's nothing that's going to be able
[14:11] to knock it down it's got to take a lot
[14:15] they made a lot of force to knock
[14:17] something like that now but that's what
[14:20] in the Bible you see David it says those
[14:23] that just trees that are planted by the
[14:25] water that's why the reason why a man we
[14:30] went we want to be where the moisture is
[14:32] always amen and I just moisture book by
[14:35] the rivers of water hey man you're gone
[14:37] when we've gone camping the guys and go
[14:41] to hell and George up in the river and
[14:43] you notice that all those trees up there
[14:45] they just seem like they have more life
[14:48] than the trees out here in this vicinity
[14:50] in these areas it seem like they're more
[14:52] green there even the bart is wet and
[14:57] then the leaves are when everything
[15:00] seems to be more most moisturized it's
[15:03] because it's right there right next to
[15:05] that water constantly feeding constantly
[15:08] p same thing with a christian that is
[15:11] constantly not just not just feeding
[15:14] when he comes through he or she comes to
[15:15] church but you're feeding outside of
[15:17] church you're constantly feeling while
[15:19] you're always near that stream you're
[15:21] always near that source of water and
[15:24] Jesus is that life may Jesus is the
[15:26] water of life they meant when you touch
[15:29] and they're going to be moisturized when
[15:33] you look at them they're gonna be
[15:34] moisturized they're going to look like
[15:36] they've they've got some life in them
[15:39] you know and some people you can kind of
[15:43] tell when some people look a little dry
[15:45] in the physical some people that look
[15:48] dry or they start pulling out something
[15:51] artificial trying to moisturize I saw
[15:57] artificially amen that's what people do
[16:00] sometimes with uh well as long as I get
[16:02] to come to church maybe once a month you
[16:04] know so that way people will say that I
[16:05] don't come to church you know but what's
[16:07] your purpose that come to churches is
[16:09] that purpose or is a purpose for you to
[16:11] be in tune with the word in Android and
[16:13] if you just come to church once a month
[16:16] I just kind of shows what's going on at
[16:19] home I'm sorry to say what's going on
[16:25] that's what I'm saying going on into
[16:26] heart at home if you and so you have to
[16:30] be constantly not just at church but
[16:33] also you have you have your personal
[16:35] time with the word right because that's
[16:38] a very important it's the way we're
[16:40] going to be moisturized then where we
[16:43] don't have to go and moisturize
[16:45] artificially a man with a different
[16:49] lotions and things it smells good that
[16:53] moisturization only last for a while
[16:56] amen praise God let it cost you all
[17:00] anything Amen now i wanna i wanna mmm
[17:05] now in if we go to Matthew chapter 11 in
[17:11] Matthew chapter 11 Jesus is talking
[17:13] about Jesus is talking about John the
[17:21] Baptist
[17:27] hmm and he says here in verse verse 2 it
[17:38] says here that when John had heard I'm
[17:43] sorry I'm happy chapter alone yeah this
[17:51] is it but I wanted to wanted to talk
[17:53] about okay well we know the-the-the is
[18:00] the scripture where John the Baptist one
[18:02] day and when they're asking him who are
[18:04] you and he said they asking him are you
[18:07] one of the prophets that no are you are
[18:11] you that Elias no not are you that
[18:14] Christ no nothing said who are you said
[18:18] I'm the voice of one crying in the
[18:20] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[18:22] Lord without a doubt he knew that that
[18:25] was him now he was anointed at that time
[18:30] amen to know that that was him a man
[18:32] that scripture was anointed to him amy
[18:35] was was was revealed to him it and that
[18:36] did that he could place himself in
[18:39] description right dislike went bro wait
[18:42] was talking about when Jesus open the
[18:43] scroll and there the temple and he said
[18:47] he said talked about in Isaiah there he
[18:53] said I'm I'm the one the other spirit of
[18:57] Lord is upon me and you know what
[18:59] Scripture i'm talking about and and he
[19:02] could he could place himself in the
[19:04] scripture internet at a certain point he
[19:06] closed the book because it wasn't time
[19:08] for him to fulfill that that scripture
[19:10] right and he knew exactly where he was
[19:12] at into work yes and so John and so here
[19:16] in Matthew chapter 11 look what look
[19:19] what he says John the Baptist starting
[19:21] at verse 2 says now when John had heard
[19:24] in the prison the works of Christ he
[19:27] sent two of his disciples and said unto
[19:30] Him
[19:31] art thou he that should come or do we
[19:33] look for another now here is John the
[19:36] Baptist who knew where he was at in the
[19:39] scriptures he knew his position and he
[19:42] also had seen and was confirmed to him
[19:45] that Jesus was that Messiah that Christ
[19:48] and yet he's here doubting because the
[19:54] Bible says that now when John had heard
[19:56] in the prison the works of Christ
[19:58] doubting if this was the Christ or not
[20:02] now remember there was also just like
[20:05] Jesus was praised for the wonderful
[20:07] things that he did your honor there was
[20:09] also criticism of his works as well
[20:11] that's right like just like all of us
[20:14] are going to be criticized at one point
[20:16] in time and whether we do good or
[20:19] whether we do bad we're going to be
[20:21] criticized right right and so probably
[20:24] some of those criticism that he was he
[20:26] look at Jesus he sits and eats with
[20:28] sinners and eats and fellowships with
[20:31] with prostitutes and talks to
[20:34] Republicans and thing like that and John
[20:35] probably thinking is there really a
[20:37] massage now maybe all this doubt was
[20:40] coming and he started thinking you know
[20:42] how her mind reason I was right same
[20:44] thing how they're doing now with the
[20:46] with the prophet of art of art day and
[20:48] he is not even here to defend himself
[20:49] but the Word of God will defend amen you
[20:53] better believe it and so he's doubting
[20:57] and then Jesus what Jesus says to his
[21:00] disciples Jesus go and show John again
[21:03] those things which ye do here and see
[21:05] the blind receive their site and the
[21:07] lame walk the lepers are cleansed and
[21:09] the Deaf hear the death that are raised
[21:11] up and the poor have the gospel preached
[21:13] today and blessed is he who ever shall
[21:16] not be offended in me and managers and
[21:19] as they departed Jesus began to say unto
[21:22] the multitudes concerning John now
[21:24] here's John he's got doubt in his heart
[21:26] but look how Lord praises John he says
[21:29] what went ye out to sea in the
[21:30] wilderness a reef shaken with the wind
[21:33] in other words he was John was a
[21:36] steadfast he knew himself in the word he
[21:39] knew where he was standing
[21:40] in other words he had root he knew where
[21:44] he was thin a reach shaken with the wind
[21:47] but what went yet for to see a man
[21:49] clothed in soft raiment behold a that
[21:51] were saw floating on Kings houses but
[21:53] what went ye out for to see a profit yea
[21:56] I say unto you and more than a prophet
[21:57] for this is he of whom it is written
[22:01] behold you see how Jesus now ties that
[22:04] scripture he says more than a prophet I
[22:07] say unto you in more than a prophet for
[22:10] this is he whom it is written behold I
[22:13] send my messenger before thy face was
[22:15] shall prepare that way before thee
[22:17] verily I say unto you among them that
[22:20] are born of women there had not risen of
[22:23] greater than John the Baptist now Jesus
[22:27] calls him greater than even of the
[22:30] prophets of the Old Testament because
[22:32] the prophets of the Old Testament all
[22:33] they could see was visions and all they
[22:35] could see Tech is tapping to to what God
[22:39] would give them but as far as I know
[22:42] there was no we're we're either one of
[22:45] them could place themselves in the
[22:47] scripture John the Baptist was the first
[22:50] prophet to place himself in the
[22:52] scripture with that Elias anointing he
[22:54] was a third that'll Iseman or that he
[22:56] was no he was one of the first ones that
[22:58] could say yeah I'm he it is now I
[23:02] correct me if I'm wrong but I don't know
[23:05] of any other prophet in the Old
[23:06] Testament that could say yeah I'm he or
[23:08] I'm Island they just knew that they were
[23:11] called but John could go back to the
[23:14] word and say I the word says this about
[23:16] me therefore this is the words that I'm
[23:20] producing hmmm he says barely i sensing
[23:24] among them that are born of women verse
[23:26] 11 they were born of women there have
[23:29] not risen up greater than John the
[23:31] Baptist notwithstanding what's this now
[23:35] I'm not what not what standard means
[23:37] nevertheless or but nevertheless he that
[23:42] is least in the king
[23:44] heaven is greater than he now that is
[23:49] talking about you and me saying we may
[23:52] not be prophets although the that that
[23:56] that that is one of the part part of the
[23:59] 50 minister night but in order for you
[24:03] because remember John the Baptist and I
[24:06] will read it will read this quote here
[24:08] actually let's read it now I'll read you
[24:14] this quote I thought this was really
[24:16] good when the brown says here in the
[24:26] message in 1962 perseverance he says
[24:29] Jesus didn't tell the nine want to give
[24:32] you
[24:48] ok
[24:54] he says now John the greatest of all the
[24:56] prophets he was the one that introduced
[24:59] jesus jesus said he was greater than any
[25:02] man had been born did you ever think why
[25:05] that was says all the rest of them
[25:09] speaking of the prophets both the spoke
[25:12] of him spoke of of Jesus Christ the word
[25:15] of the Lord comes to the Prophet that's
[25:17] the Bible said so and then all the other
[25:20] prophets it come to them in visions but
[25:24] when the word come to John it was flesh
[25:28] Jesus was the word he is the word he
[25:31] always was the word but there is where
[25:33] the fullness of God was made flesh and
[25:36] dwelt among us when he come to him in
[25:39] the water he was a prophet and if the
[25:41] word is made flesh it's got to come to
[25:43] the Prophet the word wherever it is it
[25:45] must come to a profit because a prophet
[25:48] is the one the word comes to and jon was
[25:51] the prophet of the day so the Word made
[25:55] flesh came 22 to John and so how does
[26:00] the word come to us now that think about
[26:04] what you're saying and the least in the
[26:07] kingdom of heaven is greater than John
[26:09] because now we can't just we don't have
[26:13] to just have the Word made flesh now to
[26:15] come to us we can have the word come in
[26:17] us a manner we can have the word come in
[26:21] us and full and fully reveal to us and
[26:25] make sure we may not it may be take time
[26:29] you know it may take time just like when
[26:32] when you put that seed into the into the
[26:35] ground it takes time for that route turn
[26:38] to to come out into and to grow and to
[26:41] do what the process that it needs to do
[26:43] but in time if you stay by next to the
[26:47] river the river of life it's going to
[26:50] grow and you're going to find out where
[26:52] you are in this word this word is going
[26:54] to be manifested not just on you but in
[26:57] You amen produce and others will see
[27:00] amen
[27:01] so that so that's one of the reasons I
[27:04] believe Jesus was talking about the
[27:06] least in the kingdom is greater than
[27:09] John because John could see Duncan see
[27:12] the word coming to him and flesh but
[27:14] remember what Jesus said he said blessed
[27:17] are those that have not seen but yet
[27:19] believe I've never seen I've never been
[27:23] I've never been I never went to one of
[27:25] brother brands meetings but i believe i
[27:27] believe the things that took place i
[27:31] believe though his word amen i believe
[27:34] what the Word of God says about me and
[27:38] you should and so I'm blessed you're
[27:40] blessed a meant to be able to have the
[27:42] Holy Spirit dwelling in us that can
[27:44] reveal the word Amen and become a new
[27:47] book to us Amen sister hurry i'm sorry i
[27:51] was just thinking because i've always
[27:54] wondered how could you be greater than
[27:55] John but the least in the king
[28:00] absolutely right and your bride is more
[28:04] important than your cousin and the thing
[28:09] is is that John could not be born never
[28:13] born again because Jesus had not died
[28:15] I'm not resurrected he didn't have the
[28:17] new birth like we can happen amantha
[28:20] there for you narrator than John ran
[28:23] that sense what that may amen so you are
[28:28] you can have even even more deepness of
[28:32] room then even what John had a mint so
[28:36] um and of course here's another screen
[28:40] other closer brother brother Brennan
[28:42] said he says here here was John on earth
[28:44] making that written word live in his
[28:48] time he was making that written word
[28:50] live because he could place himself in
[28:54] that's worthy man he was the voice of
[28:56] one crying in the wilderness and and he
[28:59] always also was preparing the way before
[29:02] the Messiah and Jesus said you love to
[29:04] walk in his life because he was that
[29:06] life bright and shining light amen so
[29:11] you and me Saints at this hour we can be
[29:14] rooted deep into the kingdom of heaven
[29:16] amen but we must feed on his word amen
[29:20] now you go back to some notes here
[29:27] it's precious time goes by fast now now
[29:37] what is a root and the basic functions
[29:40] of roots I'll read this here says root
[29:42] is the principal organ for the
[29:45] absorption of water and dissolved
[29:48] nutrients in most sea plants and in
[29:51] firms the room also anchors the plant
[29:54] body and can store reserve foods roots
[29:59] usually grow beneath the surface of the
[30:02] soil and extend from the base of the
[30:05] stem some roots however grow above the
[30:08] ground from branches or leaves these
[30:11] roots either penetrate the soil or
[30:13] become attached to another plant or
[30:15] object as they grow a single root that
[30:19] develops from the scene or from the base
[30:22] of a stem in this case the firm is
[30:25] called a primary route that single main
[30:28] route that starts growing out because
[30:30] after after that other routes will start
[30:32] spreading out but that main one that's
[30:35] the primary route that's Jesus Christ
[30:39] they meant they should be the foundation
[30:41] amen now that's the reason why in some
[30:44] places he's called the root of Jesse the
[30:46] root of David and others it ring on
[30:49] different routes amen he is the main
[30:51] route he's the principal root praise the
[30:53] Lord right now spring root and offspring
[30:56] amen um and so some some of these seeds
[31:04] that fell on the stony ground they
[31:06] withered away because they did not have
[31:09] this root system to in order to continue
[31:12] growing you know and when you put I kind
[31:15] of think of the soil as of you know it's
[31:19] dark its moist its looks dirty doesn't
[31:23] look attractive right but yet that's
[31:27] where growth process takes place and
[31:29] that dark and
[31:31] and moist environment yet there's rich
[31:36] nutrients and things like that in that
[31:38] soil c to the world it looks like
[31:40] something something disgusting but when
[31:45] you're in that soil lenient in the
[31:46] environment in that environment a man an
[31:49] environment of a Christian should a
[31:51] Christian should be sitting in heavenly
[31:53] places right that's heavenly places to
[31:56] us to those that are rooted but to the
[32:00] world looks like something dark and
[32:01] mysterious it looks nasty it looks ugly
[32:05] amen soil doesn't look pretty at all but
[32:09] that's where it growing takes place amen
[32:11] that's where that route can can can can
[32:14] continue to anchor itself even more
[32:16] praise God so look at all the people
[32:21] looking for all this and all the
[32:23] beautiful thing well the beautiful thing
[32:25] the fruits and all these things that
[32:26] come out even though it's in the middle
[32:29] in the midst of that ugly dark looking
[32:32] soil alright beautiful things come out
[32:35] of it yes yeah absolutely absolutely
[32:41] lilies and all that
[32:46] and so because they had no root they
[32:48] withered away we know saying that this
[32:50] is the hour that people are withering
[32:52] away their fallen away even people that
[32:56] you thought that that were they were
[32:58] rooted falling away because there that
[33:05] that little seed it starts to shoot up
[33:08] that germination process takes place and
[33:11] it gets excited about the word for a
[33:13] while it's excited about the message for
[33:15] a while God sent a prophet and the hoe
[33:19] that seven church age is looking at into
[33:21] the seals and this this and that but
[33:24] there's nothing to anchor them inside
[33:26] Amen because why when trials and
[33:28] tribulations come and things of this
[33:30] world and persecution comes that can't
[33:34] take it I can't take it so they wither
[33:37] away amen now so obviously we know that
[33:46] there is no way for us as Christians to
[33:49] avoid trials and tribulations it's going
[33:51] to happen yes you're going to be tried
[33:53] you're going to be tempted but if you're
[33:56] have rooted Amen if you're rooted into
[33:58] the kingdom of heaven and know where
[34:00] you're standing in the scriptures there
[34:02] is no way for you to to fall amen you
[34:07] may make mistakes yes the tree the bark
[34:11] off a tree may fall sometimes little
[34:14] branch here and there may may may may
[34:16] fall but that doesn't mean the actual
[34:19] root of the tree the main stem of the
[34:22] tree is going to fall no why because
[34:25] it's feeding on the proper things it's
[34:27] rooted it's grounded Amen now skipping
[34:31] down a skipping a bunch of stuff when a
[34:36] seed starts to grow we say it germinates
[34:38] the katil Adon's store food for the baby
[34:42] plant inside the scene when the seat
[34:44] starts to germinate the first thing to
[34:46] come out is the main room
[34:47] the skin starts to split in the tiny
[34:49] shoot straighten carrying the cotyledons
[34:52] with it the main room gets bigger sad
[34:55] roots appear and so do leaves to grow
[34:58] the seeds growing conditions usually
[35:00] have to be damned warm and dark like
[35:02] springtime soil a dry seat will stay
[35:05] dormant unless it soaks in some water
[35:07] then it will start to germinate all
[35:10] right now there are different types of
[35:17] roots but 11 something that caught my
[35:22] attention I was reading the other day
[35:23] there was a man who who apparently there
[35:27] was there was a dry a dry spell to have
[35:30] taken place in these up and some fruit
[35:33] groves i think it was orange groups that
[35:35] he was talking about and he had some
[35:37] orange trees are some trees that i was
[35:40] producing some sort of fruit and people
[35:43] were coming to him and never seen water
[35:45] yew trees not drying up I mean that why
[35:49] are they thriving even though that
[35:51] there's this dry spell taking place my
[35:53] fruit trees they're not thriving and
[35:55] what he explained to them was that you
[35:58] know these these roots are these trees
[36:03] my trees could probably go another two
[36:04] or three more weeks without even watered
[36:06] and why is that and he said the reason
[36:10] why is because there's been times where
[36:15] I have not give them water in other
[36:18] words i have not that they have now had
[36:20] water I've not given them water so what
[36:23] did they do after they they shot the
[36:25] main route so what happens with when a
[36:27] tree starts with when the stock doesn't
[36:29] receive water the roots start looking
[36:32] for water and they get longer and longer
[36:35] and longer and start looking for water
[36:37] in under the ground and so and so that's
[36:42] the main reason why the mother he was
[36:44] saying that my fruit trees these aren't
[36:46] trees they're not going to wither away
[36:47] you know because they have their roots
[36:50] all the way down in there
[36:51] and they're getting their water from
[36:53] under the ground and so this is same
[36:56] thing with us as a Christian a man you
[36:58] get your naughty of you if you're rooted
[37:00] down the ground things can happen on the
[37:02] outside people can be fallen away back
[37:05] and forth dry spells can be taking place
[37:08] you don't feel the glory of God you know
[37:11] with your branches up but yeah you're
[37:13] rooted and you're feeding from from from
[37:16] the abundant source of water which is
[37:18] his word the Lord Jesus Christ they
[37:21] meant so let's all be rooted in the
[37:24] kingdom of heaven this one sense unless
[37:27] know where we are in the scriptures and
[37:28] I know this was kind of this wasn't a
[37:31] little was it look was a little bit
[37:34] rocky but you know as far as time he's
[37:36] gonna be looking at that clock i hate
[37:38] time amen but understand what I'm
[37:44] talking about like John the Baptist he
[37:47] knew where he was in the scripture yes
[37:48] right he could place himself in the word
[37:52] he was rooted there was no way to move
[37:54] him amen same thing with us Saints we
[37:58] may have times where we're doubt can
[38:01] come in like John the Baptist had that
[38:03] those times you know but then you go
[38:05] back we're like brother waits in our
[38:08] last sunday is what brother Brown said
[38:09] he said faiths rest is on the Word of
[38:12] God things can be taking place on the
[38:15] outside brothers and sisters who you
[38:18] thought maybe oh they would never never
[38:20] never follow leave the message or
[38:22] whatever my faith rests on his word amen
[38:27] that's where it rests and if i can find
[38:30] myself in that work like that scripture
[38:33] that those scriptures that brother Dale
[38:35] is saying a specific scripture that
[38:37] speaks to you amen yes not just that the
[38:40] whole word speaks to me amen the whole
[38:43] work speaks but there's a certain
[38:44] scripture that just draws you even
[38:47] closer to him
[38:48] men and if you could just if you can
[38:50] just grab that word and just be rooted
[38:53] it these feed more that route is gonna
[38:55] be it's gonna get you know even when
[38:59] there's a dry spell that room still
[39:01] going to get looking for that word it's
[39:04] not going to say oh I'm dying you know
[39:05] I'm dying and just give up you know oh
[39:08] there's a dry spell you know and
[39:10] everybody else is falling away what I'm
[39:12] gonna fall away nobody's going into
[39:14] church anymore i'm not going to come to
[39:16] church anymore you know no you that
[39:19] route amen something secretly has taken
[39:21] place underground and all that ugliness
[39:24] that soil something secrets taking place
[39:27] amen praise God let's be rooted in the
[39:29] kingdom of heaven anybody have any
[39:31] questions or any comments sister transit
[39:34] to think of it when these storms and
[39:36] really take the truck and loosen the
[39:39] rest it causes them today
[39:42] oh yes so there's little battles we have
[39:46] strengthening metal roof amen I like
[39:50] that they have the battles and true and
[39:52] traveled into relationships jesus said
[39:55] in his word and I was telling my mother
[39:58] in law of this scripture the other day I
[39:59] really love the scripture he jesus said
[40:03] in the world you will have tribulation
[40:06] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[40:09] world amen so let's have that overcoming
[40:13] us a man let's go ahead and go up thank
[40:16] you
