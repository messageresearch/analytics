TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good to be here today had a good time yesterday kids had fun the adults did get out of bed probably a little bit sore playing ball and stuff that's okay it's all right Bible says bodily exercise profit a little so it does profit a little [Music] unless you gets old start you start hurting sometimes you get a little wisdom and you know better so you just don't play at all yeah amen I have you know there used to be when you participated there was The Observers and now that now that someone else participates you be the Observer Regina just asked if I play wisdom W yeah right uhuh never mind with that one cuz we're on the internet we're live on this no comment all right let's uh let's go to Revelation 6 and let's get started with the four seal now I want you to keep in mind keep in mind you got to turn that computer keep in mind keep in mind that uh when we get finished with this four seal the Rapture has taken place okay when the force seal has opened and we get a revelation of who we are and what we're doing here and have the word established in our heart then the seal has done its job the seals have done their job and we're gone that's right is that all right yes all right so you got 1 2 3 4 5 6 [Music] seven all right let's look right here one 2 three four five six 7 now just just do this we did this a few weeks ago but just to go back over there's your there's your seals which is one open then two open then three open then four open then five open then six open then seven open all right now we know one thing's for sure that the seventh seal is a mystery so let's just erase it off it's a mystery because it's in interwined in all the seals right okay so the seventh seal is not just it's like we were talking about before so seventh seal is the end of all things end of the struggling world end of this end of that end but it's not an end like we think an end it's a beginning our end is our is our new is our beginning into eternal life right so you take the seven seal out of the equation because he is the equation he's all of them all right because there's not going to be brother R said the seventh seal brings him back to Earth well when that seventh seal opens to us as individuals it does bring you back on Earth EMP power the way that he was when he was standing on Earth brother BR said he become visible Among Us raised the dead going to Rapture now we know for sure that Jesus is not going to walk through the door the visibility of Jesus Christ in the end time in under the seventh seal is such a mystery till it's intertwined into his people cuz there's not a seal I think sometimes we think well there's a seal out here let's see like a what was that NY Drew Mysteries you know you get a clue here and a clue here and you you go through and and the tomb Raiders and all that stuff you know and Indiana Jones and you get a clue here and you you click a key here and then this key opens this well spiritually yes that happens but that's not a natural you're not going to go and try to find in other words this natural seal this is all hidden man doesn't know one thing about it normal man well I don't say normal man we're the only normal people in the world right but insane part of the world even the even the devil doesn't know what these seals can do he knows that there was one and Hey listen he was there when these things were spoken that's right okay but like brother R said if it lays on the page can be quite question but once it comes into a life see he he couldn't he couldn't get in these seals like we do now he can be so close brother Christian I were talking yesterday so close doesn't mean out there he believes the way we believe that the two seeds in the framework of the church the mess's church this church right okay the two spirits in the framework of the message church so it's the two spirits in the framework of the message church denominations I don't say they don't care about the seals but you'll never hear them preach them because they don't understand them that's right and if they do they get a carnal application of a man standing with a f in a book and tearing seals off and reading something that's never been written before but that's not what happened even with the prophet of God when that seal got tore open or when that top got ripped out of the pyramid Rock and like it wasn't that new words were down in that pyramid he said the he in other words he didn't say the words were there but he said light had never Shone on that before well the words had to be there it's just that there wasn't light shining on them it was sealed up so that's the same way with these seals they are sealed up Daniel go to your people seal this up till the time of the end I don't know that Daniel didn't see the seals but you know what he done he saw the mighty Angel come down out of Heaven just like what happened in type and sunset Mountain what happened over there is the same thing happened to Daniel cuz there was an angel come down put one foot on land one foot don't see right one in Revelations say time will be no longer cuz that's Gentile but remember in Daniel's time when he put one foot on land one foot on sea he said this is for a time times and a dividing of times three and 1/2 years so that was was to Israel and really the seals are to Israel they're not to us they're to Israel cuz brother R said Revelations what 41 to Revelations 19 is all to Israel well Revelation 6 is in between that you know but we get this we have to get the spiritual aspect of this happening so that it can go to Israel right through the two prophets okay so we have to get an understanding and a Breaking of all these seals to understand what's going on so now want to pick that off there cuz it's holding up my thing this is the rapture okay is that all right yes that doesn't do away with five six and seven right okay now what has to happen to me and you now listen to me what has to happen to me and you 5 six and 7even has to lap back okay under the for S cuz we got to have to me 5 six and 7even is the is the apex of the change of your body okay who who took a body chain the man the man himself I I you know let's go even call it the seventh anymore let's call it the man cuz it's not the spirit Christ Jesus no it's not the Jehovah Christ Jesus it's the man it's the flesh man cuz the seventh seal was preaching the Sixth Seal so it wasn't and sure when you say well what are you doing away with God no but I'm showing you there's a man there's a flesh man had to come on Earth and he had to speak us into existence by the spoken word of God right amen so he's the man I was think about yesterday um how that what name I'm sorry what title does Jesus Christ mean the most to you what title what title son of man what title what title you see the son of man die and go to hell Revelations 5 if that man don't redeem your soul you're dead and we know it's the son of man but Redeemer to me to me that's the Apex of what God means to me if he hasn't come he can come as Rose of Sharon Lily in the valley that's okay you know what that's peace that's Joy but without that Redeemer that's why I that last Sunday I I spent so much time on on what job saw job saw my redeemer liveth he didn't see sure he saw son of man but he couldn't call him that he didn't say son of man he said I know my redeemer what he saw a man take his sin throw it away and even though the skin worms destroy my body in my flesh I'll see this Redeemer because he's the one that did the redeeming he redeemed me back okay so that's to me and that's me you you can say well he means this but that right there if that Revelations 5 man hadn't to took that book as a redeemer that's right if he hadn't to come to this earth he's the only one that could be a redeemer right you say oh I'll die for brother Bob and I would give him a life for it but that don't save him none at all that's right hello I can be so peaceful he can call me the prin of Peace if you right that's right but I know he can call me the Prince of Peace he can call me Jehovah that's right but when he says you can he says you can redeem me from where I was to where you are that to me is the that's to me is the Divine love because there's no no only one man could do that brother Bram told us he said one man can't die for another even though you can die for them give your life but you can't transfer your life okay see if I transferred my life into Bob it'd still be sinful it'd be just it'd be just born in sin shap and iniquity but when that Redeemer came that's right when Heaven and Earth kissed and he became the man Christ Jesus not the spirit you got it yes we must worship Him in spirit and Truth we know that but what but what kind of spirit do we worship if Jesus would have never come we'd have never seen a redeemer Son of God is not the Redeemer that's right the son of man's the Redeemer the man that came to this earth and gave his life so I was tell him brother Lis I asked him the titles what title would you give Jesus Christ or the man what title would you give him they said Son of Man a different one I said yeah that's true I said but the son of man you believe in the son of man there's a lot of people believe in the son of man hey be real truthful about it me and brother Chris we talking about yesterday Judas didn't know he was a son of man man but he knew one thing for sure he said in his in other words he said if you're who you say you are you're a powerful guy and that man gave Judas power to cast out Devils that's right and he was a devil himself or the devil entered into him later we know that but his predestination was that he was going to accept the money and and go to predition right but still okay he still was judas's Redeemer right if Judas would have went on to the end if Judas would have went to Pentecost God would have redeemed him so to me that's the most powerful name right there you can call him whatever you want to call him but if he if he's not your Redeemer then you're lost that's you're lost whether we take a body change or not if we're saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost sitting in Heavenly places right now he is my redeemer and my soul and whatever I got in me is going to come right back up cuz he redeemed me and he even redeemed my body at Calvary CLA he claimed that body at Calvary right so that's to me Redeemer when you say Redeemer that means and you know brother dick likes to say Creator and that's okay but he created Judas he created the devil he cre that's okay to say Creator because that gives him that position but when I'm standing in my position just knowing he created me well what about Satan he knows God created him but yet he still wants to destroy him he wants to destroy God but here I am on this side of the sin curse looking at my redeemer and if and if he's if I say if for you not for me but if he's my redeemer he's going to take me back regardless of anything that goes on okay so it's just a point to ponder about that word Redeemer that's why job that's why brother Brown said job saw the resurrection he knew he got to a point he knew his redeemer is the one that was going to do it Jo couldn't do it remember Jo was a little bit self-righteous Pro I can do that I can I can I can I right no there's only one man that says I can I will and I'm going to and he's already done it and that was Christ Jesus you know all power in heaven and earth been given unto me true all right so there's your man so what here on we got a background a little bit we got the Rapture taking place right here on this seal that we're talking about the bride is seen no more from Revelations 41 remember when John saw a door open in heaven Amen brother B said that's the Rapture cu the Bible says after these things what after the revelations 3 the seven Church ages all right after the seven Church ages Revelations 4 there was a door open in heaven well that's Rapture from 41 to Revelations 19 is all to the Je all right but we have to have the spiritual part of this okay we have to have the spiritual part to get us to Revelations 19 where where right here it was a bride right here's a wife okay this is the bride this is the bride in the seven Church ages this is him coming back with his wife I'm a tour Lady okay got everybody got that so Revelations 41-19 is all to the Jews but we can't tear it out and say well that's not for us we don't need to understand it we can't do that we got to have the spiritual part of all the Bible amen all the Revelation oh y'all pray for June this morning her mother had a accident this morning and didn't make it to the bathroom she's having to clean it up so that's why she's not here but keep her in your prayers and deana's there too that's why I just saw her faith but we'll get to it um Rapture takes place on a four seal everybody got that why prophet of God because what your combat Beast are gone right that's the Holy Ghost amen that's the Holy Ghost the combat Beast is the Holy Ghost cuz right here and when he had opened the fish still I saw under the altar the souls it doesn't say I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name s him was death hell Fallen power was given to him all down through here got it let me go back up one and when he open the for SE I heard the voice of the fourth Beast which is what the man let's write that right here man I mean I'm sorry Eagle right here I got it right there that's the eagle anointing why because the eagle anointing is going to carry us off the Earth that four seal is going to carry us off the Earth because what is it justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and and then the word back in power like it was because what is the seven still what is the man he was the what word made flesh like I said Sunday you got to remember one thing whatever he gets we get right we are heirs and join airs that means that if he's at this position we're not at this one that's right whatever HS and Joint HS is right there right that's right that's what we're not believing we're believing that he's way up under somewhere and we way down here somewhere okay he has made us Kings and priest why that's Revelations 5 he took the bug he's the Redeemer he's the one that's redeemed at all listen when he took that bug he redeemed everything from Adam that's right Adam all the way to the Future home amen all right so that's how powerful that seventh seal it okay the word made flesh all right so now seal 1 2 3 and 4 and then we'll read the seal here excuse me 1 2 3 and 4 is your combat beef your lion ox man and Eagle everybody got that we've been over and over should all right but I want you to see that cuz when we go to 5 six and seven why is the reason we take a Rapture just because the day on the account I mean it's God just got a he's just got a day right here this is the 23rd and we're going to that's the day I'm going to come right there now he knows what day it is but it's when you and I are at our Apex of of Readiness in other words when we are at our peak of Readiness how why would you wait why would you go out and the corn has just a few ears on it and it don't have any kernels and you just start cutting it down no you have to wait till it matures why cuz all the fruit has come to its full potential don't cut the beans down if it's just like this you know don't cut the beans down let the beans mature then Harvest what then reap all that that you that you that you've sewn so what we come to here and we look at this the for seal to me is we have reached the Apex of what we need on this Earth to go on a Rapture cuz if a Rapture happens on the four seal guess what somebody's got to be ready that's right there has to be a resurrection in here somewhere amen so the fourth seal is the resurrection and the Rapture cuz the next thing we're looking at is what the resurrection not the Rapture amen that's right Resurrection we need to start thinking that when you know it's okay to sing I'll see you in the Rapture and I'll see you over there and you sing that that's okay MH but there's got to be a resurrection first yes there will never be a Rapture without a resurrection never we will not take a Rapture without the all the saints back with us okay that's right so what we got to do is is make whatever the strength is in that sixth Dimension we got to make it in this Dimension that way the two pull together and that Dimension is done away with cuz you know what once they all come here the Six Dimensions empty right that's right there's nobody else in it right there okay so they may be compartments we've already talked about that foolish version but to me just to put it on the bottom line the sixth Dimension is the perfect love brother R's talking about everyone that has the New Birth from the day of Pentecost to the day we go home is that all right and every one of them is going to come here right into this Dimension there they're going to take a body chain get their bodies then we which are alive and remain shall be changed and then we'll all be caught up why why are we going to be caught up because it's finished it's done for the Gentile dispensation that's right there's no Gentiles to be saved after the r when we see when we see the dead Saints Walk Among Us brother Tatum the Tom the Gary the Richard when we see them walk among us it's done that's the way I see it if it's not it's within a few days it's just that transition remember there's always a little bit of a lap over but when we see when we when it's revealed to us that the dead Saints have come Among Us how can anybody else be saved that's right how I I just don't see that the door will be shut and you know God will have a powerful Church to propit in God said well what is a powerful Church the most powerful Church in the world was Jesus standing that day when he said Lazarus come for amen right cuz brother R said if he had said he said all them dead saints were to rais exactly how powerful is that and then when he said I am the resurrection and the life let's go back to our little illustration when he says I am the resurrection and the life then we say well we're not much what he got we got that's right the Saints will only resurrect through a live message someone has to be alive that's right why I Seek You the living among these dead people right yeah before you yeah u i remember you mentioned something was it two sunds ago or something like that you talk about the resurrection and there being a consecutiveness of for example we're not going to we're not going to raise like Martin Luther because that was that was our age right it's the people in our age and then what about the what about Martin Luther well brother said it would be a worldwide Resurrection remember the Bible says there' be some one in the bed and one in the field that means that there's uh the dark side of the earth which is the night and the daylight well see Martin Luther is not going to raise in the United States right that's why um help me somebody that's why Joseph said don't leave my bones down here in Egypt he said take me to Palestine brother Brown said they he knew that's where the res well that's where Martin Luther's Resurrection no I don't think we'll see Martin Luther till we get all together to go home okay I think we'll see our group right why would we know Even sanki Calvin finny why would we know them we're going to know the people we know you're not going to see Martin Luther recogniz them no we would not no and they are what Born Again under Martin Luther's age they actually at that moment this is the way I say it will not be at the fullness of the Revelation like the ones that stand for the body change so they wouldn't be able to they sure they can communicate I believe what's going to happen we all get to the Future home we know there's we're going to that's what we going to talk about for an eternity that's right Martin Luther right and all Martin Luther's people okay are going to come to you and me not making us anything but they're going to say how in the world did you put all this together that's right well we had a prophet coming in time we're going to tell what we're going to tell a story and it won't be a story no it'll be the truth of your life I mean you take hey if you take seven say There's 7 billion people on this Earth if you just sat down and listen to everybody's everybody say we're all 7 billion people of Christian it take sever hundred thousand years just to listen to something especially Aaron he'd be another he'd be a couple million years talking about him first get to be quiet talk about somebody else anyway but you you understand what I'm saying so you take a whole Earth of seven b that long yeah know I know we'll be in eternity brother so won't matter okay but um right but I mean what what do you we're just going to sit there and just say oh this is so pretty oh look that's a pretty bird no we're going to talk to each other right tell the Redemption story tell the Redemption story to somebody else go talk to um Columbus age where all they done is give their life you know you meet a woman that they tore her baby out and killed her for her stand for the gospel she didn't know one thing about one God what a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz it was all under trinitarian she didn't know one thing about the seal she didn't know one thing about what we know amen right well why can't we tell her about that that's right tell her about how that that she come under the ox age yes M and made it through because of that man Jesus Christ the Redeemer what a wonderful time I mean M that's just and that don't make nothing out of us but when we come to the apex of the word of God there's no man ever come to that except Jesus Christ William brandom and the bride that's all and I say that with humbleness because this age but remember this age brother and it takes all four combat be for us to get through this age it only took one for them to get through the OD age they gave their life for the gospel listen people there was no Bible during that time they had to it was all by either written down what somebody said because the Bible didn't come into view until Martin Luther's time the written bible putting all together right I mean the Catholics had the Latin Vulgate but what did they do with it they shut it up and kept it they read it to the people when they wanted to but if you didn't understand Latin you you were left out that's why the Bible says they without us that's correct but it's not that what it's talking about to me is the revelation of the word that we have that's correct yeah it's not there listen if they're in the sixth Dimension they're in Perfection that's right believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved they believe that Jesus Christ is their savior that's what they needed in this age right here M believe that what Columba preached cuz they had to come in under their m Messenger right that was it that was all they probably didn't live very long if it killed 68 million Protestants in 1500 years that's a lot of death you didn't live a long time back then so what a glorious time and it's not going to make us that but still even Paul even Paul's he's like man I I could see the the end of the year age but I I really couldn't understand how how that guy there I look through a glass dark but you know what he always says though he turns and says but I see Jesus see I see the Redeemer always go back to that Redeemer if you ever have a problem go to Redeemer cuz when you say Redeemer I'll don't know one thing for sure when you talk about a redeemer I was lost and whoever that man was he put his life inside of me right and Raised Me Up redeemed me and I'm sitting in Heavenly places to me that makes it real simple if you'll take it right down to that word Redeemer because what is the seals for Redemption that's right the seals was not given just to be a mystery that we can say we know more than you do that's right cuz what people in the messages made it so mysterious till they shut it back up and put the seal back on it and said you can't get it unless I open the seal for you how pitiful is that that's why the prophet of God gave his life to get this gospel out he you know family friends he didn't have hard but he got this gospel out so that me and you can be here today and we have more clarity right not that we've added to not that we've taken from but we have more clarity of what the Bible's talking about I was sitting this morning I'll tell you a little experience I sat this morning and I was reading in Corinthians and just for a second I mean just for a split second I believe I was with Paul okay when he was writing to the Corinthians okay cuz I was reading he was talking about you know I I've come to talk to you and and I've come to tell you this about this Christ and I've come to do this and you Corinthians oh he's you you eat stuff made to idols and and I could just see myself sitting there or see Paul not myself but Paul I could just see Paul like he's sitting there in jail and he's writing and what is he doing he's writing his thoughts he's writing his experience he had with the Corinthians that's right he lived it that's right but what did God do God thought so much about it till now it's Eternal Word of God so it's an experience that will last for an eternity in other words what I'm saying so if you got the Holy Ghost Paul's got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost speaks to you then I've always said if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're the only person that can understand what this is all about because you have the person that wrote it hold on you have the person that wrote it inside of you yes that's right am we're not a lesser form we got to start realizing that we're not a lesser form than God Paul didn't even knew that Paul wasn't a lesser form of God no cuz Paul's the one that said ARs and join ARS right he understood that whatever Christ got there in Romans 8 whatever Christ got we got that's right all right all right so let's read this still now what I want you to see one more time we're going to go through one 2 3 and 4 which we've covered almost here then it's going to be a Rapture mhm but now you got to take five six and seven before some of you came in five six and seven you've got to take back actually do away with number seven that doesn't sound good does it but anyway seven is right here it's the whole it's the whole seal right he is the seal amen he broke the seal when he come out of that tomb he broke that seal prophet of God said he broke the Seal of death do we believe that got to start but five and six has got to lap back over into here cuz we got to take what this is not just the Redemption of your soul this is redemption of your body right and we know it's a process right to get your soul redeemed there's a process to get your body redeemed there's a process so when we get into 56 and seven let's look at how that God comes to the outside of the man okay [Applause] through spiritual understanding that's right not just that number fifth seal is the souls under the altar the 144,000 plus the are the ones killed before the 144,000 the Jews right fif SE Jew is the souls under the altar crying how long excuse me how long to avenge our blood so we know that's not Christians but there's a there's an understanding in that seal that you and I got to have that's right okay and we'll we'll talk about it later on but we got to get through this for seal first okay now I'm going to erase all this scribbling here but everybody got that when we get to the four seal we've gone home we have come to a situation that no man has come to except Jesus Christ okay so here let's go let's look at the symbols and then we'll I got to go hook brother Chris up and when he had opened brother Chris said he called his wife last night and he said he said honey how how are they cuz you know you get a new guy come in you don't know whether we're weird weirdly legal weirdly legalist or whatever you know so he said honey he said she said said I told her last night I said honey they have Easter egg hunts like we do so he has no problem with that will enjoy he's I he went with me yesterday to take a beehive out of a tree so he he got a baptism yeah he stayed away he didn't get stoned but he was with me when I when I got out of the tree he wanted to go so we took but when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see so what voice is that the voice of the eagle anointing the prophetic topof thee line this is not double A Durham baseball this is Atlanta Braves I'm talking about major league if you want to put it in that category this is when you come the words back in power the problem is the word never lost its power the effect of the word lost his power on the people okay it's the effect that man has what man has put so much of an idea around it till it's not been able to work because the word only works in people right the word not you can print 65 billion message books 6500 billion Bibles right won't take you nowhere that's right won't take you nowhere right but when that word comes alive inside of you amen and you can speak back to that word cuz Jesus was what the word made flesh so you and I going to have to do the word made flesh so say eagle or prophetic anointing all right I looked and behold a Pale Horse now what do we say the pale was was mixed it's a mixture of red um of U red black I missed one white red and black all right white red and black mixed up together um uh not a good look at color but you have to look at it on the wonderful side of it that when you mix the true justification true sanctification true baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to come to an understanding of the word like no one else would come to when you mix all this together now now God a separator but he does mix these together yes okay all right to what to form the word made flesh right that's what we're looking for I say that's what we're looking that all right and then there's a name s on him was death and Hell fall power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth kill the sword the hunger with death with the Beast of the Earth all right his name that set on him was death and hell so there's a name name comes under this and then we have to look and see that the four seal is the um this part The Headstone connecting back with the church going to pull them out of the ground and we going to go home okay so that's what's going just let that Force seal just read it a couple of times read your Force seal that brother R preached on the force steal read that next Sunday and then what we'll do is we'll start Matthew 24 and read that and then we'll go forward so let's go [Music]
