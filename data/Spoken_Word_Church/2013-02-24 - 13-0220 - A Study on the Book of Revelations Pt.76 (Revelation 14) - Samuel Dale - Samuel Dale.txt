our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 and Revelations 14 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he s and signified by his Angel and to his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand okay we'll go over into Revelations 14 1-5 and I looked and low a lamb stood on Mount Si and with him at 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of great of Harpers harping with their Harps and they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders no man could learn that song but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the earth these are they which were which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whether soever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto God and into the L you may be seated here just think about the things now that that we talked about and uh you know where we've been and the things remember in the message prior to this one we were talking about the Seal of God and finding out that that seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right and then we look into that and we see that the mark of the beast we found was to reject that Holy Spirit right it's not a hard bad thing to do it's simply just turning down God remember we told about the the man that the Holy Ghost tried to come on he was a pope or whatever you call him there and the Holy Ghost tried to come on him and he wouldn't accept it he was the one that wrote the decree see that it was better to be forced to serve God than it was to do leave you alone so they went out and begin killing they killed 68 million you know Christians naturally speaking and like the prophet said how many billions spiritually right did they kill with their Doctrine cuz where is that Mark of the Beast and what is it it's not a stamp in your forehead of 666 or some form like that of a credit card or a or a you know line of that or certain things it they said it was a number of a man we found that 666 then to be vicarious filad which means instead of God right so the pope declares himself to be instead of God and that's the only city in the world that the Bible says sits on seven heels you know that is a religious form to rule the world is Rome Italy Cincinnati sits on seven heels but it's not a ruling factor of the world in what's called Christianity but we found that seal of God that baptism of the Holy Ghost that remember in uh the Ezekiel the rider's inkhorn I'm just trying to background a little bit and then we'll move up remember the rider's inkhorn where he was told to go through and and mark all of that was to sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the City and see that was in a time that it was not the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you could not receive it because Christ hadn't come but it was in the time of typing what would happen into the real true believers that would sigh and cry for the Abomination done in the city or the wrong that surround them in their churches Etc and praying for the people and that would be back dar see it was a mark in their forehead all right seal those who sigh and cry well then we found out in the Bible it was talking about that these 144,000 would be sealed in their forehead right we found out we would be sealed in our foreheads by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not in our head not in our our doings but it would seal Satan out because it would seal in the soul of the individual ual in the New Testament part and sealing in the Kingdom the I I wish we did have a baptism of the Holy Ghost a ceiling of our brain you know our forehead as we call it because what is the mark of the beast the doctrine the ideas the thoughts and we read there where brother rown said it was even just like saying well I believe and I go to church in other words what else do you want besides me going to church and being a good person I want you born again I want you to have the Seal of God Amen and not just in your forehead right but to be in the baptism of the Holy Ghost now the 144,000 doesn't receive it just as an anointing or something in their forehead they receive it as the new birth for their time the hour that they're living but they are sealed by the word of God Amen because remember it was the name or the number of the name you know or the person or whatever and if we have the same Doctrine what is the image to the Beast same Doctrine right if we have the same Doctrine you said but now brother Dale the Baptist the Mist the Presbyterian the Pentecostal Catholics Brites Etc I don't mind making it that way you said they don't all teach the same no you go to a dozen different Baptist churches and you're not going to hear the same message preached but what is the basis of it the basis of it is the trinitarian concept right whether it be explained in many many different ways and different thoughts you know I've heard Baptist preach real good messages on one God right because that's the basic Baptist Doctrine is one true and living God but to explain it is God in three persons Blessed Trinity because they don't know how to explain it right that's right but yet having the same Doctrine see that every church then has got the same Doctrine right anything that you see that it's in Attack of the godhead is like brother dick was talking a while ago when he goes to a church he takes out the Bibles and he looks in them and sees whether or not it attacks first John you know or something like that why because you know that some trans translations change some of those scriptures all right and some churches use those things all right now when you start changing it why your because it doesn't fit your Doctrine and if it doesn't fit your Doctrine you want to change right so you even change translations or or writings you know to make it fit what you're believing right well then you see the people of this message the same way the people of this message this got brother rand's words but yet they got the same concept as the Catholic Church heard just one today that brother Ray was talking about it there it's on something on there I'm not going to say it's on the Internet or stuff but he read it about this brother saying that brother brandom said he was born on April 88th or born April what you know the and instead of the ninth you know more maybe a year before the other and he he don't want to trust him no more well I I'd like to talk to that man for about 5 minutes now I wouldn't be talking your way to chew him out you know what I'd be doing I'd just be listening to him because in about 5 minutes you're going to cross yourself you watch people in about 5 minutes you're going to say something hold it you just crossed your head you know so what I told a man one time he said I want to talk to you about the godhead I said okay we'll talk I said but now once you cross the truth I'm going to raise my hand he said all right so he said two words I raised my hand I me honest he had said two words why because he already crossed himself well see you see the people in this message that claim brother around to be a prophet and then trying to tee down the things that he said whether it be dates or whether it be whatever it is you know and and they they're trying to tire that why what's the what's the point what's you're trying to destroy what he said and it's not over the godhead one of the doctrines and the message is not over the godhead right it's over whether he was in a certain place at a certain time or certain yeah right you say well that's not in oh but see the background is what if you can destroy a person's confidence right of the prophet's message and the dates of the times of the seasons whatever you're automatically destroying his doctrine of the godhead I don't give a hoot what you say about how you believe in one true and living God right I did too when I was in the Baptist Church and believed he couldn't stump his toe and hurt himself but then I be to read the Bible and come to find it out I was wrong amen but you see what I'm talking about now Mark of the Beast seal of God the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul which is revealing the revealing of the word right now there's no way to get the B follow me please when I say something listen to the words I say you w internet I listen listen at least to the way I say it don't trick my words with me if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're already sealed right with the mark of the beast right right no no okay I knew I had it so the day I just happen to think go ahead brother Joe and pull up number 1 18 and let's just read what brother rown says on you United under one head preached in 1958 326 now what happens you can't stand neutral you got to be filled with something to survive notice you might be filled with one thing over another one another you say brother Rand I'm kind of on that fence on the fence no you're not do you say I just don't understand is that a familiar saying I don't understand what you're saying no you don't want to admit it's right what I'm saying y listen to what he's saying what look the brother said I'm I'm kind of on the fence he said no you're not the Bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost receed the mark of the beast all that didn't have the Seal of God in her forehead had the mark of the beast you got one or the other we were born with the mark of the beast right tell me what else you would have come we were born in Satan's domain all right see then you're either sealed in or sealed out right if you're sealed out it's got to be the Antichrist right yeah but brother there what about these people in justification and sanctification in this day now come on over here where I'm at let's don't get back out with brother brand in Luther and Wesley we can talk about that if you want to come on talk to me about it cuz in the days of Luther the just shall live by faith put him in the body of Christ right but it won't put you in there now you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we'll get to that the Lord willing Sunday on those three angels in the Book of Revelations and their messages all right but you see justification and sanctification today don't put you in the body of Christ they don't give you eternal life that's not the Seal of God right you could be totally justified and Sanctified and still not have the the new bir right or the Seal of God you're in the process all right but just get that point either we're sealed in or we're sealed out one or the other it's not brother R's fault that we're that way right and it's not his problem that he called us in way right we ought to have enough common flat ordinary sense to know what he says is Right amen that's as hard as I can say it I wish I could find Sterner words to make it with but brother d r around and said brother said that bring it on and let's see that's right I'm just I've challenged you out there come on what's the matter right you're so scream every wor else but scream you said Brother D you're not CH I'm not challenge you challenge me right why because you're teaching people contrary to the word see then you're the one that's causing problem not me but you see I'm the one that's blind you think you know everything no but I know somebody that does come let's talk about it all let's see whether it's the Seal of God if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot deny the word you want those quotes and Propet that's right that's you tell me you can deny the word and say you got the new birth you say brother around said so and so but I don't believe that by what Authority that put you above him okay get off but now listen the the father's seal in the forehead of I'm making this for a later message all the Seal of God in the forehead of the 144,000 we've explained that is not just in their forehead it's just a statement of ways of doing all right because we're sealed in our forehead if you take it correctly because your conscience and subconscious a working back out through that forehead and if you're sealed in on the inside the outside's going to come to the truth of it but they get the new birth they get the Seal of God they're not the bride is that the way your Prophet said it but they'll be in a millennial R now watch that in a minute how and where is the scriptures where brother randam would say that they're in the millennial R you know where would he get it from remember he's a word Prophet all right but just think about it now they have his name written in their forehead you remember when the first time you was reading in the Bible and somebody begin to talk to you about maybe water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you'd never seen the little name n m too much you know you didn't read that too much but once you started thinking about it just everwhere you turn the old and the new it just always name name name it's like buying you a beautiful purple Buick and nobody has got one like it and you pull out of the dealership in I got one nobody else ain't got one like this one about that time three go by you just didn't see him before right and that's the way it is in the Bible you didn't see it but then once you see it it's just everywhere right see everything you read is name everything you read is related to that well that's the way God does things amen that's the seal in you you realize you're sealed by the revealed word come on right got to go through your forehead to get there to be seal all right I try to get off the seal I want to preach on that okay but now remember the the difference between the Jews in our day and the 144,000 is what not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost an anointing poured out but you read he word right will you agree right right amen that's why that it's the father's doctrine that we always need to make sure we have you know I was hoping today that cuz I said so much about him but I was hoping today those that were at their funeral was watching my brother and listening to him the man is Anointed yeah sure he can hold your attention in he preach messages i' like I've never heard people in this message some them never try to preach you take an Old Testament and type it with a new testament situation and keep you spell bound but I was hoping you would just see what I'm talking about anointing that's right and see how that anointing and just it will lead you right in like that man throw me time up the Carol there said I went to school to learn how to control people he said but you have it by natural I said I have I don't have I I try to preach the word the word's what's got the anointing with it that's what Spell bound to my heart is when I hear somebody preaching the word that raises my heart into a a wonderful situation why because I can talk about that that's part of me wait in a minute till we get down to where it says and they Sayang as it were you don't say this 144,000 sings a new song they sing as it were that's right a new song all but listen Church do we see this message is what sealing you and I we're being sealed in even though we have a new birth look at the Statue of perfect man that is a ceiling in the Kingdom they'll be in the ceiling one day of the The Headstone and when it is you don't have to worry about it then right it may be a short powerful right demonstration the prophet said but he said it'll be here brother Dale are you looking for a great anointing to come yes your Prophet said it would fill every fiber of our beings and take us in the Rapture that's exactly oh you look at the hospital being he didn't say that he said that's not true right he said it never was he said Jesus walked in the greatest anointing ever been and walked by and healed one man that maybe had some poate problem or something they had it 38 years wasn't going to kill him he said he healed a man turn walked out right the greatest anointing took the scriptures and read it handed the Bible back and turned around and sat down is that right right said precious words preceded out of his mouth amen but you know them Pharisees didn't like what come out of that mouth cuz it was ripping them to Pieces right right right it's according to what side you on all right but see the seal in your forehead is the doctrine brother said a church without a Doctrine is not a church that's right two Soul people have a doctr everybody rallies around the doctrine when they get together they you seen this quote I didn't know the prophet said this here look at this one here one look at this one here look at this one here do we get together about the truth right now right come on May I need to say like R Adam he said how many sign crying for the Abomination done in the city he said let's get down and see what the real evidence of the Holy Ghost is now I didn't say that your Prophet said it amen yes it is you don't ever it don't ever rip your heart to pieces to hear the people of this message and see how happy they are and how to do it then we here amen just like I told him downstairs when to go brother dick and I talk I said you let this next pop come out of the United States you ain't never seen such a Revival is going to be among the people of this message for about 3 months and then they're going to realize it ain't working what they done in' 77 come on churches at the end of 76 6 and the end of the 77 and then they gave them a Year's leave of absence you know at the end of 77 they were screaming in holls all over at the beginning of 77 they was saying we're here he had a whole year shouting Glory Hallelujah where are they now right amen am I hateful for saying that if I am I'm sorry for being hateful I'm not sorry for what I said am but now think about it it's in your understanding all right this kingdom is being sealed in these virtues is being sealed in by your understanding amen not just natural understanding but by Holy Ghost amen revealed word amen seals us into the Kingdom right but how many wants to hear the word right but see then are they afraid of the message Brother Don and I talking today about this man I'm not laughing about him but life C thinking the way that people just message you and he told him I preached 75 sermons or something out the book of oh that's deep but hurt St one how do you know what I said right I told you you know I tell you things and then finally you'll run into somebody that'll verify it right brother dick they'll wind up and tell you that you ain't a Baptist you ain't going to heav I try to tell you them things and then you go run into them but it don't run into that because I told you people say stay out of the Book of Revelation don't get in Genesis don't get in the Book of Revelation and then somebody preaching oh I ain't going to listen to that oh I'm that's the way let me quote the people of the message I'm not going to listen to that cuz I might get confused right remember we were born confused that's right remember we were born with the mark of the beast that's right yes sir your spirit of the word the man said you remember to brother Brown somebody referring to it just recently said brother Brown said you scare people talking about the Lord coming he said I'm sure's probably stop just Ratt his head you're scared of the coming of the Lord Bo would that be something for me to be overseas somewhere and I'm getting ready to come home in wife oh Lord he'll be here in a little while scared of coming I better stay over there right right all right but now listen let's just take this Revelations 14 but I want to make the statement like I always try to make Revelations at least 7 8 6 7 8 even back and forth parts of five but 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and we're up to 14 it's in a 3 and 1/2 year period right right called a tribulation of Jacob's trouble these things are taking place and what what we're trying to do is just speak about it like we did on the the compound meaning you know and compound Revelation not different meanings not you seeing one God and me seeing three and oh we just both saying the same thing no compound meaning is call my son out of Egypt and Jesus coming out of Egypt right one was was Israel coming up the other one was Jesus deeper meaning or opening of the word when do we get on this I'll say it and then I'll get back to it it says there in Revelation 14 they saying as it were right a new song but over in Revelations 5 they said they singing You song that's right well that's Pang different song one of them is the song the other one as the song let we get to that a few minutes let's just take it and just think about it we shouldn't have any problems whatsoever to comprehend what is being said in chapter 14 and verse one I want to pull that back up from where they were reading a while ago let's just go verse by verse just a little bit and just look at it and see what it's actually saying see we don't read it as it's saying we read what we want it to say oh yeah right and I looked and lo a lamb stood on Mount s son that's o n z n and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in the foreheads now listen and pay close attention Mount sign is on Earth you said well Wonder okay and this 144,000 received the father's name a seal written in their foreheads in other words they get the new birth for their time 144,000 receive the Holy Ghost do you need that amen we'll get back and read it in a minute just but look they're on Earth verse one's on Earth verse two is in heaven ready look a lamb stood on that sign on Earth 144,000 we don't have any trouble knowing who this is this is not a symbolics we left a symbolics back into some of the ages and the you know I mean the the seals and the different things you're getting now more to positive statements there's no argument about who this is he doesn't say there's a group of people standing on M sign with the lamb but we don't know who they are it plainly tells you who that is right yep and what they have MH right that they get for their day and their time I keep saying that cuz they're not in the bride of Christ the bride done go in the Rapture in Revelation 4:1 this is Israel in the tribulation not a British Israel doctrine of trying to make it a bride or this that or the other now look at verse two but I want you to read this now you mind if I read it to tricky and I heard voices in heaven as it were a voice of many Waters did I read that wrong yes you did yeah I read that wrong didn't I cuz what it say John on Earth right writing of what he sees on Earth he sees the 144,000 sealed on Earth all right and I Heard a Voice from heaven but that's all as of the voice of many Waters now we know what waterers is people right John when he hears this it's so much in unison are are U together so much until he hears one voice right are you reading it y hey he hears one voice in other words but it's in many people cuz they all got the same Revelation you agree that's why it's one voice brother R talking about it in the ages and he said thousands of live voices amen thundering out and there's the voice of a great Thunder he said to bride down Through the Ages thundering out the word of God the revelation of the day they we living in I'm going watch what I'm getting in and I Heard a Voice from heaven on Earth heard it from Heaven a voice it was so much they were all saying the same thing do you understand and then when it comes out then it's what as the voice of many Waters many people saying the same thing that's right okay and as the voice of a great Thunder that comes back to one the Thunder is a voice of God right so the voice of God is sounding through the people until when John hears this it's just one voice you know what he said on Revelation 5 on Revelation 5 he comes down to there he said everything in heaven everything on Earth heard I heard him amen saying it amen right amen and watch and they heard the voice of Harpers harping with hearts were in heaven look what it says and they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the Beast and the elders and no man could learn that song Amen but the 140 and 4,000 which were the redeemed from the earth okay okay brother Joe pull on up now to Revelations 5 go on up to Revelations 5 yeah that was 14 pull up Revelations 5 and I beheld and L in the midst of the Throne of the four beast in the midst of the Elder same situation same groups of people same Throne same four Beast same Elders same lamb which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth that's the bride of Christ down Through the Ages right he came and took the book out of right him him that set and when he had taken the book The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vs full of oders which are the priers of the Saints this is the bride in heaven you remember Revelations 5 is the bride in heaven the question they asked brother brand he answered it wrong said it was not the bride then he come back and he said that is the bride amen and look what it says in verse n and they sang A new song Amen thou AR worthy to take the book that's what the song saying right the song they're singing this group in Revelations 5 is saying saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals to loose amen right they sang a new song so you and I when we're born again I thought we believe we were supposed to sing a new song I thought it was a song of redemption I thought it was the telling the of the word and and the seals to be open and and was slain and and redeemed to God by the blood out of every Kindred I thought it was the Plan of Redemption that we're supposed to be singing abouten yes but why would it say here and they sing a new song which is the bride now go back to Revelation 14 with Y I'm working them at night I told him I said I don't know which way I'm going I said we'll just go amen I don't know which way to go I've got something I want to get off and if I get it off it's going to hurt feelings if I don't get it off it's going to hurt mine I don't mind talking put together with it what you want look what it says and I heard a great Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many people over there they were the voice of singing about the Plan of Redemption right in Revelations 5 now look and they sang as it were a new song before the throne now why would they say as it were a new song why didn't they say then they sing a new song they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost 144,000 but it does not make them the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right right cuz the bride done gone in Rapture Revelation 4:1 amen Revelation 5 you seen in heaven singing about the Redemption amen I redeemed by love divine when this 144,000 comes up and that's who's doing it right right now come on read it to where it is see if you read up here and look here you like we don't know who's saying it okay read verse three again they saying as it were a new song before the throne and before the four Beast and the elders and no man could learn that song but the 144,000 all right see that's why they don't get the new birth to make them the bride of Christ they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost they get eternal life but they'll never be the bride so they can't sing Our Song amen right you know the foolish virgins who claim the blood of Jesus Christ and claim even sanctification you realize they can't sing the song of the Bride amen right come on they're lock in the ages and things in the days when Martin Lu come along they brought in songs for that day and they begin to write certain songs and bring them in and some of you that are song people you know you you'll know in a hurry what I'm talking about because you know songs were written in a certain times and it was written about the age they were living in and for to help you to understand better you jump over to char and John Wesley and them under sanctification and they wrote of about the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood all her songs were related around the blood why because that was the message of the hour right right all the songs in Luther's age was about justification right being free right amen well see then what happened when the zeusa street came along one of the I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them singing about the name of Jesus right see as the ages change the songs change I'm trying to give you an example to help you understand what they're talking about and they sang songs what about the people of this message they started writing about the token they started writing about ell easier getting a bride for Isaac justification right Joy Justified Justified I Always sung it wrong and I did Brother bis was that time and they trying to sing with me and I sang in other and they sang Canadian and I was saying I never done it in the first place I'm Justified well they couldn't sing it that way cuz it was contrary to their language all right they were saying they never did it in the first place here I am laughing not at them laughing at all of us but listen Church you understand what I mean every age down through have songs for the age related to the message of the hour right look at all the new songs that are out now about the message and look how we'd even take songs that were written in previous ages and upgrade them a band of angels coming after me we say seven angels coming after me I don't know when that song was wrote it wrote for another age right now look it says then in Revelations 5 that they sang a new song it's a song of redemption th aren't worthy you're the lamb you're the one that has done all these things you paid the price mhm yes but when it comes to the Book of Revelations verse chapter 14 it says they sang as it were a new song in other words they sang it as their own Plan of Redemption you realize if the prophet had not give us the Plan of Redemption we would not know no the keys that we know to the Bible that's right you agree right that's right and we wouldn't know and listen folks you can argue with me all you want to I ain't going to argue nobody when I was in the Baptist Church I knew that the Old Testament people didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost like the New Testament people had because I was able to read right I naturally couldn't explain it no way no right but I knew it just didn't fit I knew it was two D for groups of people an Old Testament people and a new testament people and I knew if it was a new testament it meant a new covenant not the old covenant made new a New Covenant that's right made through the blood of Jesus Christ so we can sing the song of redemption why because we're the redeemed the Bible said let the redeemed say so amen we can sing it Lord but that 144,000 can't sing that they're bride W be you'd be surprised how many people in this message was Bing over that right now sitting out there on the internet but why don't you study right why don't you read your Bible right well I not get confused no you already are you understand this 144,000 sings a song now I didn't write this book did you read it off of there do we need to pull it back up where it says in that 144,000 was the only one that could sing this song that's why it's called as it were a new song see we don't sing about being servants we don't sing about being uni we sing about being the children of God Amen you see Israel can't sing to say that they're the bride so it's as the same song that made the Redemption over here the same one that paid the price at Calvary for you and I to give us that new song of redemption is the same one that gives them their they're doing right I get time I'll get back to the scripture on it in a minute listen Church they saying as it were y a new song What About Your Song what are you say that's right right why is it sister Gil that you used to sing in a choir not a Christian choir but one day they was got to singing a song that there's some verses in there that she Trinity that she couldn't sing why because she knew that that wasn't right right that's simple that's bringing Christianity right down in their lives but you couldn't sing what they sang you think it bothered the rest of them they said Trinity oh they could just pict your voices out of this beautiful that's what lady said one day told her daughter said brother Dale don't believe in the Holy Trinity I said that's exactly right because the Trinity word not in the Bible I don't believe in no Holy Trinity cuz there ain't no Holy Trinity there's a holy God revealed in many manifestations but not a Holy Trinity there's a God in three manifestation but not a God in three persons that's right and you know that that puts us together where she couldn't sing that song cuz there was something inside of here says that ain't right the Lord that's right that ain't right see then you sang a new song see I can sing praise Father Son and Holy Ghost and just don't put the rest of the words to it right right I just don't do the rest of the song well because I'm singing a new song right amen right amen there in this message don't wrote a song about i s a new song yeah but now listen I want to get something right here even to verse four say these are they which were not defiled with women but they virgins these are they which follow the lamb whether soever he goth these were the redeemed from among men yep look being the first fruits that's why people thought that was a bride see when you say first fruits first fruits is referring to the bride right we're the first fruits where're his offspring we're the first fruits that's why we're the we have to be in the resurrection it's the first fruits right but here's talking about this 144,000 they're the first fruits under God they're the redeem from among men they follow the whatsoever he goe now I won't get there know CU done run that too far AR we get to it Sunday about the Unix and the things and I I think we're missing out a lot too A whole lot but these people can sing a song that even we don't sing right what do you mean they strangle about Redemption we strangle about Redemption Martin Luther couldn't sing they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name baptized with the Holy Ghost and Powerful service came now what he did for them that day he'll do for you to sign I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them Luther didn't write that song the people that day didn't sing like that why because the Plan of Redemption wasn't revealed Right Wesley come along with sanctification the blood was revealed they even taught the S really true T just sanctification is actually teaching that you're saved by the literal compound of the blood that's why brother R said that's not that's not correct right but that's what they believed that it was a literal compound brother said no it was a life in the blood that's right the Westland never Tau you had to go get a drop of Jesus's blood don't get me all confused I born enough in that Western them I ain't saying they went out there you know and T that it was the drop of blood dropped on each person brother ROM had enough sense and didn't say something like that it was their mind that was linked to the doctrine and the thought that it was the blood that saved right and they had plenty of scripture for her right MH that's right we see it's because the word wasn't revealed right so they couldn't sing the songs we sing today right amen that's right they can't sing that why cuz it wasn't a song of their day you notice here it ever so often I change the theme song we're not just the regular one who uses you know and I'm throw off on nobody heav help and I forget it but a lot of the church people follows of the message singing like only believe or you know or they'll sing Amazing Grace or whatever they're seeing theme song the theme song Here is changed when I see a change in understanding right so that's why we're singing and have been for years now what Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord right Open the Eyes of My Heart amen you know that's just as real as reading Revelations 1 1 to 3 77 times cuz that's what we've done you see that song hit me and when it did I said that's what I want Lord I want my eyes open to the truth amen I want to see the truth yes sir you see they saying as it were a new song look back up brother Joe but I want to make sure you get the point Revelation 14 and brother Anderson excuse me verse one 144,000 lamb standing on Earth they get redeemed that's the only way they know the song right you go along with that amen the only way they would know as it were a new song is for them to get converted amen God if not they would sing something about the Old Testament you know CU they sing for everything like brother d s pigy on wife Pig there when we was in Israel I got it written in my Bible they sang like certain scriptures as they entered the temple and moving up I'd love to been there heard that right moving up but wouldn't it be odd to what everybody body else would hear they would hear do you understand what I mean you step up one time you saying one of them one of them and then you step up I know it was the blood no we sing all them songs now and he step up you know the one that got on number one back there he's singing one of them it sound like chaos wouldn't it every step you take up you'd start a new song but the people coming up the steps they start on that first song it's not the whole group of people that's what I thought the Lord this would be Mass confusion if it wasn't knowing within my heart what they were doing when you step up on step one you say I'm one of them you move up I know it was the blood the guy behind me steps up and say one of them it wouldn't be Mass confusion I know I'm carnal I know it you ever thought about God listening to all of our prayers yes you don't never think like that I mean maybe I'm the only dumb one in the crowd I guess you know what really did get me one time George Washington on his knees at Valley Forge praying for God to help his army Jackson which one who was the other one the South Stone Wall Jackson pray him Lord help me in my folks now who would you answer if he was God come on I know maybe I'm just done the way I think I know that but I just think about that and I think Lord but you know what he heard what Washington said and he took care of some of those people someone got blowed away he heard what Jackson said on the other side and he took care of some of those people the others got blowed away you understand yes he hears our prayers he hears me thank you but look Revelation 141 one is on Earth getting sealed into the body you know what you would call it for them with the eternal life of their age and riding in their foreheads just like it's in ours then John I Heard a Voice from heaven now this group on Earth finally gets killed you go along with it you agree 144,000 are killed right right see they're not up here until they get killed here right then John he hears a voice it's up in heaven he sees all of these Throne same as Revelations 5 he sees the four Beast same as Revelations 5 he sees the elders the 24 Elders same as Revelations 5 now he's up in heaven see that 144,000 will have to be raised one day if not how are they going to get in the Millennium cuz they are killed right and they have to wind up in the Millennium was your Prophet said to do but I wish you would understand me and people listening would understand the way I do I try to preach I know the word Progressive is not supposed to be even a word but I like it myself because I I mean it as today I see this tomorrow I want to progress up further I want to increase and go on into and walk into and keep on going you know I call it partial realization the perfect realization whatever it's doing but you see the same ones are guarded in Revelations 5 so that means this group of people is taken up to heaven here they alive on Earth we know they got to be killed here they in heaven that shouldn't be hard to understand if you to read it cuz the same scene of Revel 5 is the same scene of Revelations 14 they're killed and they go to heaven you when I think you just killed and go into the Millennium I would advise you to try to pick up a little bit on that as you maybe the thinking to understand they're going to go to heaven before they go to the millennium right everybody else is going why not let them go right right now I'm going to say something that I told you I would eventually get back to you see this has always been a confusing statement to me understand the four Beast understand understand the lamb understand the 144,000 understand the singings and the doings but I don't understand how that there's 24 Elders in heaven in Revelations 5 maybe you do I'd like you to explain it to me cuz I 24 Elders I thought we understood it to be the 12 apostles and the 12 Patriarchs right I thought that was our understanding and I can understand the 12 apostles getting up in to Heaven can't you the Rapture that's no problem right right mhm but how's that 12 Patriarchs get there and according to my understanding now if I'm wrong show me that if the 12 apostles represented the bride you know the whole bride right then the 12 Patriarchs would represent Israel right MH how did they get there right he said well this happened and that happens we got the scripture back here where the Old Testament Saints raised but if the Old Testament raised and went up to heaven where did he go that's all I want to know because according to my understanding they're right there in chapter 5 but according to my understanding the 12 apostles in chapter 5 it would have to mean after the Rapture some word this comes together right you don't know what's in my heart but all I want to know is how they got there where they got to where those Old Testament signs go to where did Enoch go where did Elijah go where did Moses goz brother said Moses didn't die right he said the PA barar come picked him up he said that's why they couldn't find a body right right where did the Old Testament Saints Go when they raised where did Enoch go or where did Elijah go you say well the Old Testament Saints raised with Jesus in the first Rapture of the New Testament that's exactly right you say now wait a minute no you're wrong well you go read your rapture me iin got time preach on it the Old Testament saints went up with Jesus which is the first resurrection in the New Testament you better explain that real good to me careful because according to my understanding Jesus went up two times right Jesus raised and came up and said Mary don't touch me I've not yet ascended I go to your father and my father and then 30 40 days later on M went up irregardless of where the Old Testament Saints how they raised where did they go you don't know what this is doing to me but I me I'm not on nobody I just want to know amen you see one the Old Testament saints went up with Jesus amen but where did they go is there a place provided for them somewhere where did you go all right let's back up a little bit where did Enoch go before the blood of Jesus Christ was shed Right Where did Elijah go you remember they the charot you remember the two raptures in the Old Testament you remember right Enoch and Elijah this put Moses in there is a Aid to help and we come to find out that Moses and Elijah comes back with Jesus on the Mount of transfiguration right and brother Brown says that was in theophany right right were they there with Jesus in physical corpal bodies I could change it where did they go that's all I want to know if you take them up physically where are you going to take them to right right listen folks this ain't no new thing to me right I've been studying this for 40 years I know the quotes brother Bram gave that they raised in Mortal bodies I know the quotes he said of Enoch even raising an a mortal body I mean CH Rapture off I just think we're missing raptures and things we're just making it what we want it to be that's all I ask is where did he go was there a special place that the Old Testament saints went up to to stay until it's all over with and then they wind up in the Millennium which I believe they will be in the Millennium amen I believe the Old Testament Saints now not everybody right I believe 144,000 I've talked to you that will be in the Millennium the prophet says that I believe the fal Jew will be in the Millennium amen don't have to go to the white Throne that's right M that's right now not every Israelite because there going to be a white Throne judgment that will be judgment brought down upon a lot of the Jews for the rejecting of Jesus Christ amen that's right where did it go see we study the message and we say they were here they would do this and that but do we keep on studying it run around at the same time that he says that the Old Testament Saints raised in Mortal Corporal physical bodies H say it one day Adam will reach over and touch Eve and Eve Eve will touch Seth and Seth will tou abble say even comes down to Abraham and there'll be a resurrection in the great Rapture message that we talking about I got it right here if you want he said one of these days there'll be a BL from heaven and said those Old Testament Saints will raise and go up and we will fall right in line and go up with him brother randam where did those Old Testament Saints go to he said the gate swung open and he cured him into the city even because it's a new city well it they go straight into the future home and is that the new city he's talking about it's very odd he made some statements in there that is left unturned you know what I mean unnoticed he said when Jesus raised and took those Old Testament Saints he said he went straight to the father I'm paraphrasing it so I'll be glad to give you all of he said father is finished he said climb up on the throne and sit down until I make your enemies your foot stol that's Revelations 5 when he climbs up on the Drone and sits down it's Revelations 5 right so we know where Jesus went to he went to Revelations 5 and he sits there until it's all finished and it's all almost 2,000 years or over 2,000 years you remember I were emphasizing while ago that on Earth 144,000 then had to be killed and then here they wind up in heaven this two verses later they're in heaven rejoicing with as it were a new song so I could see where they went to they went to Revelations 5 that's why there's 24 Elders in Revelations 5 we only dealt with the bride of Christ being in Revelations 5 there's 24 Elders there that means it's 12 Apostles and 12 Patriarchs so now in Revelations 5 you've got not only the bride you got the Jews there too the real chosen Israel not all here okay right and as it's there then they can come back into the Millennium after the marriage supper see the Jews can come into the Millennium then but according to my understanding when Jesus was told there now we know it's not in the scriptures as far as a quote said he said cown upon the throne and sit down till I make your enemy is your foottoo I always thought The Last Enemy to be destroyed is death right is that scripture do you need a scripture for it that's the scripture Last Enemy be destroyed is death then it can be said you know mortal and in my you see brother R says it like this he said we're still dying so death is death was conquered at Calvary don't misunderstand me please but it wasn't appli that c to the Redemption of this body that's right to be applied in the last days that's where ene their enemy will be death be destroyed he said but I've got the quote for this says job stood right there in Jerusalem in a Corporal body CU he had said I'll see my redeemer but you better read brother Brown he said job said in the last days he said the last 2,000 years job said I'll stand on the earth the church I know what this has costed me you don't most of you know nothing about what I'm talking about but it's cost it in my heart you see I have to say what I believe amen and if I can't see something I'm just going to tell you I can't see it and I'm going to tell you I'm not saying you're wrong I told Paul Jones that and talk to too doctor I said I'm not going to tell you you're wrong I'm going to tell you I can't see what she's talking about well you know what that meant to me I couldn't see what he's talking about you know the one that started two so doctor but listen Church you got to get everybody in Revelations 5 because Revelations 5 shows the bride Revelations 14 brother R said is perfect traval order which is a millennial reign that's his word he said Ezekiel Saw the 40 to 44 of the Millennium temple being built on Earth and he said Ezekiel Saw Israel in perfect tribal order that Dan and Ephraim will be put back in making it like it was supposed to be he said Revelations 14 is the tribal order so in Revelations 14 you got 144,000 which means Dan and Ephraim is back in Revelation 7 you got 144,000 with Dan and for missing you see I believe Israel is going to be in the Millennium I believe they're going to precede us and that 144,000 is going to come back right and that Israel is going to come and they're going to have a millennium temple built cuz you and I are the anointing to the temple we don't come back to build a temple we come back as the anointed to right who would know better how to build a millennium Temple than Moses yeah right God started off it would know better right but you see I'm just to make this statement and I'm going to hush if we believe the Old Testament Saints raised in a glorified body and you're saying well brother brandham I've got probably 50 quotes the brother Brown that says they were raised in a Corporal body or did rais in a Corporal body but because of the other statements he made then I make a statement if the 144 th if the if the Old Testament Saints raised when Jesus did physically corporately with eternal life Body Spirit and soul then Paul was wrong right when he said our last enemy is death because they would have already destroyed death are you listening not what you agree with me or not see if the Old Testament saints went into immortality in the resurrection with Jesus then physical death is destroyed right you see according to my Bible it says in Hebrews 40 comes all the way down talking about the Old Testament Saints even names them Abraham he would named all of them in Hebrews 11 4 11 excuse me not 41 comes down naming the Old Testament Saints and you really even got to be very picky to find the bride of Christ in Revelations 11 you know brother random has to define those scriptures because the basis of coming down and it states it twice in that that having not received the promise or some better thing for us that they without us cannot be made perfect you see Church it wouldn't be them waiting on on us it be the fact that they done gone and we done missed it you don't know one day you will you see I love everybody but when I preach I preach when I believe amen if it's wrong I can be corrected I don't have no problems I've never told you here at all to never listen to nobody have ever told any of you not to listen to nobody I mean anybody always told you listen to who you want to but what was mistak but if you bring back here what somebody else said then I approach it from here right I tell you then what I believe and why I believe it well that's what I done so you see I'm not the only answer I'm question I guess I want to know some answers amen I want to know where those Old Testament saints went if they just didn't go up in Revelations 5 and Revelations 5 I'm going ahead and put it here because it will fit totally perfectly if people would understand it Revelations 5 is just prior to the Millennium fixing to be set up that's right amen because there is the marriage supper old brother Tatum used to quote this a lot and I love little Tatum so you know that so I wouldn't try to destroy anything we used to quote something and he said it's in the Bible that we're going to set at that welcome table Abraham Isaac and Jacob I believe that 1 million per you understand I believe that but ain't no scripture ain't no scripture says we'll sit down to welcome table meaning the marriage supper but I believe we will I believe at that marriage supper there's going to be a bride spread out and there's going to be 144,000 they wither at the marriage supper there's going to be a fifth seal Jew at the marriage supper there's going to be all the Old Testament saints that it spoke of many of them the Bible says not everybody will be at that marriage supper be welcome guest and when we come into the Millennium we look at this 144,000 as being servants what do you mean what do you mean I mean they waiting on me to get the plate to do this I want to that the scripture yeah I want brother around message we make them servants right the Bible givs them on honorable position that's right right y not be surprised and I read a scripture to you Lord within Sunday that to show you what God thinks of the Unix we see we think of Unix is all being sterile people you brother said they were we think of Unix as being sterile as not being able to father children only thing I'd like for you to answer me one thing cuz that brother told me that one time I just I'm sorry sorry for being ha people I just asked a simple question cuz a brother told me one time he said or told us here he said Joseph was made a unic when he was sold down there to potier so potier wouldn't have put him over his wife as a guard if he'll still you know a man I only had one question how did Joseph wind up with Piper's wife wanting him come on a sterile unit and she wanted him and you know what she wanted she said come and lay with me and I asked the brother a simple question I said according to my understanding I thought Joseph father two children that's right right I didn't say that then the might not order say this tonight but I'm going to say it if Joseph was castrated and made sterile they must have had a great restoration process back there right you might not like that language but I'm blunt because I'm just making how silly it is they must have had a restoration process because he fed at least two children but you see we don't even know the Bible right I ought to make the statement then just go home order to say it like this you know that Apostle Paul was a unic the Bible says there's Unix that are made of man there are Unix that are born Unix right but some are Unix for the kingdom of God Paul said I got a right to get married but said I won't in that sense Paul was a unic I've ever even heard people talk about Unix couldn't carry the gospel well according to my Bible in Acts you'll find who was it which one Philip went down to the Ethiopian unit and that Ethiopian unit was one that carried the gospel where was it India or which Ethiopia where Ethiopia Ethiopia C the gospel down there and he probably was a stir unic that ain't got nothing to do with preaching other words they said preachers can't be preachers they got you know ability C cor cor right Paul said some men have made Unix for the kingdom of God they made themselves Unix they become sterile to themselves Paul said it was better that a man to not marry right but he said some can't contain this it's then go ahead and get married but he said if you can believe this remain as I am you know what a brother told me he said Paul was married said he had to be married to be in a Sanhedrin I said don't give who what the Sanhedrin is anyway because it all messed up I'm honest that's just where I said it I kept on looking till I found it if you want it I'll be glad to give it to you but R said Paul said I could have married but ain't going to do it Paul was never married you see church we just make our own Doctrine right and we try to make things fit to our ways of thinking but let's put it all together come on musicians let's get it all together you say well brother Dale are you stating that those Old Testament Saints when brother R said they raised physically I'll say what he said they raised physically mortally all I want to know is where they went I wonder where Enoch went in a Rapture before Jesus Paid the price and went down to Paradise then you say well Paradise was emptied out amen I believe that quote but why don't you get on over where Paul said he went to Paradise that's Bible so if Paul went to Paradise Paradise must still be real you remember when he was talking about the third heaven and the things and the same thing he said he went to Paradise Paradise wouldn't annihilated it went up you say again what are you saying I'm saying according to the Bible in Revelations 5 and Revelations 14 The Prophet said was coming into the Millennium bringing them back tribal order but there's 24 ers 12 Apostles and 12 Patriarchs right those Old Testament Saints is right there in Revelations 5 and one day that will be a total reality and we'll come back to earth until that time comes there's part of Revelations 5 that is not complete right you want to know what it is you right amen you are you not the bride amen amen but we don't have eternal life in body yet do we no so they're still waiting on us amen you order to read some what brother R says on day waiting on us read where he says they were even waiting on you and I to get ourselves straight come on talking about them to get ourselves straight you know why because we are the one keeping the Rapture from coming that's right amen he said I see nothing outside the Readiness of the Bride come on we are the on that's doing it and we will keep dying until it is all made right right the death one day will be destroyed that's right you won't have no hold anymore on us but it be real this time if I hurt your feelings I'm sorry sorry for hurting feelings I sitting there today thinking lord I can't do that I'm done CU I don't believe in argu with nobody and I don't believe in hatching up things and preaching on every service I believe in stating what you believe and going on but when doors open sometimes you know you see more and you just walk into it just walk into it it's like you want proof that the 144,000 are going to be in the Millennium they're on Earth and they're killed and they go to heaven and they're in Revelations five and there a little bit they coming back to Earth to be Unix to the bride not no servant we say go get me something you w't be that kind of servant because we won't be that kind of people right what about it go ahead what do we got standing somewhere in the shadow you find Jesus he the only one what you think about can you see the book unfolding we didn't got to the place that we see now no matter how it comes to pass Israel is going to be there the prophet then when he made those statements that I've read many many 40 50 years ago right at it he said the Millennium is for Israel I thought how they going to get there that's all I want to know how they going to get there well God will do it well TR but he'll tell us in the word in the shadow have and you know him his somewhere in the shadow Jes the r standing for someone else God take of
