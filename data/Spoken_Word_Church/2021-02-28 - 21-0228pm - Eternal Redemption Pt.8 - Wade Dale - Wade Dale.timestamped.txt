[0:00] so we learned that my brother was
[0:02] homeless
[0:03] and he didn't tell anyone and so
[0:06] the only person he could call was pastor
[0:08] tony down in
[0:09] six flags and well he
[0:12] contacted us and the first thing we
[0:15] could think of is try finding a place
[0:18] so we all thought okay let's find him
[0:21] these extended stays down there
[0:23] and we did he stayed a week there
[0:27] he found a job and then
[0:30] we were like okay we don't want to pay
[0:31] another 330 a week
[0:34] let's see if we can find an apartment
[0:35] for him or a roommate for him
[0:38] so i went down there and i told him okay
[0:41] i'll go talk to
[0:43] a few of the sisters and brothers at
[0:45] brother tony's just to find out who
[0:47] knows of an apartment somewhere or
[0:49] you know where to start looking and i
[0:52] went i got some
[0:54] numbers and but pastor tony told me
[0:57] before you go let me take you to an
[1:00] african store down there in austral
[1:02] and they list on the window there
[1:06] on the outside you know somebody looking
[1:08] for a roommate and they have a list of
[1:10] numbers there and like we called all of
[1:12] them and
[1:14] they were all taken and then while we
[1:16] were in the car
[1:17] i told my brother well let's go and he
[1:19] said too let's go back in there and tell
[1:21] the shopkeeper that
[1:22] you know if somebody's looking for a
[1:24] roommate just call me and i left my
[1:26] number
[1:27] and then there was somebody behind us
[1:30] who wanted to pay whatev for whatever
[1:32] groceries he had
[1:34] and then he had the conversation and he
[1:37] said
[1:38] oh uh brother you're paying 3 30 that's
[1:41] a lot in a week
[1:42] uh i got a living room you can come live
[1:45] with me
[1:46] but i also know of a friend of mine who
[1:48] told me yesterday he's looking for a
[1:49] roommate
[1:50] i said okay can you give us his number
[1:53] and he did
[1:54] and he said well let me call him first
[1:56] so he did
[1:57] and we contacted him and he was willing
[2:00] to take my brother
[2:01] and we drove and he found a roommate now
[2:04] and he found a place to stay
[2:06] so it was a coin i told him
[2:10] it was not a coincidence that he walked
[2:12] in at that time we were
[2:14] having that conversation and he had the
[2:16] whole conversation and
[2:17] decided to help and um so he's somewhere
[2:21] and he's settled in he's working and
[2:23] we found him akai and all that and
[2:26] that's why the last two sundays i kinda
[2:27] had to be down there and

[15:33] annual sister's day fishing trip
[15:37] they going to find some water somewhere
[15:38] so they might not be fishing
[15:40] but uh keep all that in your mind write
[15:43] it down on your calendar so you don't
[15:44] come up one day and go i forgot
[15:48] so get you a big old calendar me and jim
[15:51] got them all over the house now we have
[15:52] all calendars for this and calendars for
[15:54] that and we got a big one in there in
[15:55] the
[15:56] in the uh in the study so
[15:59] we're still creatures of time
[16:03] so let me have us gotta get up and go to
[16:05] work tomorrow then we're still creatures
[16:07] of time
[16:08] well we might not be creatures of time
[16:10] but we need to work make some money
[16:13] but for right now let's just settle down
[16:15] and listen to
[16:16] what the lord has for us so we're still
[16:18] in on eternal redemption
[16:21] today we're going to go into the um try
[16:24] to get through five
[16:25] of the dimensions um boy i got to
[16:28] studying a little bit on the fourth
[16:29] dimension on the radio waves and it just
[16:31] kind of
[16:33] curled my toes and i just said no we're
[16:35] going to stay simple we just
[16:36] we're just going to stay simple but i'll
[16:38] bring out some things that's really
[16:39] interesting
[16:40] because the fourth dimension is the
[16:42] dimension that we can't contact
[16:44] we cannot contact the fourth dimension
[16:47] we have to have
[16:48] a piece of equipment that catches i mean
[16:51] it's here
[16:53] it's right here right now proving it by
[16:56] one thing i'm speaking
[17:00] it's going into this right here
[17:04] by airwaves it's going back there
[17:07] and it's coming back through these
[17:08] speakers
[17:10] so there you go you know and but you
[17:12] can't see them you can hear my voice
[17:14] sure you got receptors to hear it but
[17:16] you had to have
[17:17] something to hear with because if i
[17:19] muffled this and cut it off
[17:21] those in the back couldn't understand so
[17:23] we had to have something extra
[17:25] to help us to contact that fourth
[17:27] dimension and we'll talk about that just
[17:29] a little bit but we're not going to try
[17:30] to bore you i just want us to know
[17:34] why we in this plan of redemption
[17:36] yesterday
[17:37] my whole thought was as brother dale's
[17:40] whole thought was was before the world
[17:41] what what was i mean this plan has been
[17:44] laid out
[17:45] god's got he knew he's going to need a
[17:47] fifth dimension he knew he was going to
[17:48] need a sixth dimension he knew that we
[17:50] were gonna
[17:51] if we didn't have a fourth dimension
[17:53] we'd have never got the prophet's
[17:54] message
[17:56] never would have picked it up if we
[17:58] hadn't had that fourth dimension where
[18:00] he
[18:01] stands up there in 1947 and he says
[18:03] we've got this new
[18:05] device i think maybe you said or
[18:07] something gadget
[18:08] we got this new gadget in 1947 and
[18:12] really the first ones were on a wire
[18:15] and then the next one were on the lp
[18:17] like a record player
[18:18] and then the next one were the uh the uh
[18:21] eight
[18:22] um eight inch reels which are magnetic
[18:26] it was a magnetic voice it was a
[18:28] magnetic reel that picked up the voice
[18:29] and then it sent it back to me and you
[18:31] so the voice of god in this age was used
[18:34] the fourth dimension more than anybody
[18:35] ever used it
[18:37] amen so god had that dimension there and
[18:39] you know what there's another guy that
[18:41] uses it too
[18:43] the devil uses it also he puts all of
[18:45] his other junk through the fourth
[18:46] dimension uh your
[18:48] your uh internet and everything else is
[18:50] in the fourth dimension all right
[18:51] so we'll talk about that just for a
[18:53] little bit but i want to um
[18:56] get on the chart just a little bit
[18:58] because god knew what was going to
[18:59] happen
[19:00] the plan was the way god saw it so he
[19:03] had to have a fifth dimension he had to
[19:05] have a sixth dimension he had to have a
[19:06] paradise we're going to talk about that
[19:08] a little bit today
[19:09] he had to have a paradise a place to
[19:11] wait
[19:12] before you could go into another
[19:13] dimension now see you see where the
[19:15] catholic church is
[19:16] brother john the catholic church sees
[19:19] satan is so close
[19:21] the catholic church says you got to go
[19:22] through purgatory
[19:24] before you can get into heaven and
[19:27] purgatory is kind of that place between
[19:28] heaven and hell
[19:30] well we're going to see that brother
[19:31] brown can totally tells us that the
[19:33] fifth dimension
[19:35] is hell but it's not a burning hell it's
[19:38] a place of holding
[19:39] the catholic church is just saying while
[19:41] you're down there getting held
[19:43] we can pray you out for a little extra
[19:45] cash
[19:46] for a little extra atm work we can get
[19:48] you out of we can get you out of hell
[19:50] but no
[19:51] you'll hear what the prophet said he
[19:52] said once you leave this earth
[19:54] your decision was made here and you
[19:57] can't change it
[19:58] when you get there like brother dale's
[20:00] talking on predestination see that part
[20:03] that is predestinated
[20:07] so let's bow our heads i think we got
[20:09] all the announcements out of the way
[20:11] damn the father we thank you for this
[20:12] day we thank you for the word that you
[20:13] give us already
[20:14] we pray that you'd give us more father
[20:16] just pile it on to us today lord but
[20:18] give us understanding that we can
[20:19] understand
[20:20] it ears to hear eyes to see
[20:23] and lord just be with each one lord that
[20:24] six is to christine and all the
[20:26] different ones
[20:27] ones that are outside lord by the kern
[20:29] he's coming out and
[20:31] bless his heart lord he's been to the
[20:32] church service and
[20:34] we thank you for that and we know one
[20:35] thing's for sure that that effort has
[20:37] not been
[20:38] overlooked you knew it before the
[20:41] foundation of the world
[20:42] that we would want to come to church
[20:44] more than our sickness but lord we have
[20:46] to do certain things lord to keep it
[20:47] away
[20:48] we pray that you'll just be with each
[20:50] one of us bless us take care of us
[20:52] lead us in guide us by your holy spirit
[20:54] lord you be the active participant in
[20:55] this service
[20:56] you take over and do the work father we
[20:58] pray for the bride around the world
[21:00] that you'll take care of each one lord
[21:01] and raise us up lord
[21:03] so that we can get out of this place or
[21:06] not be babies lord we'll be
[21:08] full-grown christians that we can get
[21:11] out of here lord
[21:13] and go home we thank you for all things
[21:16] that you have given us
[21:17] even this temporary home we thank you
[21:19] for giving us that lord our jobs and our
[21:20] health
[21:21] and all the different things our family
[21:23] and all the different things that you
[21:24] give us lord to even be here
[21:26] in this first three dimensions lord
[21:28] you've give it to us lord for us to make
[21:30] a choice
[21:31] and may our choice be you father bless
[21:34] each one lord we ask in jesus name
[21:36] amen hebrews 9 verse 11 says but christ
[21:40] being come and high priest of good
[21:41] things to come by a greater and more
[21:42] perfect tabernacle
[21:44] not made with hands that is to say not
[21:46] of this building
[21:47] neither by the bloc by the blood well
[21:50] that's hard to say
[21:51] by the blood of bulls and goats bulls
[21:53] goats and calves
[21:55] bob got me messed up and now he's got it
[21:57] up there he's bob's running out so you
[21:59] can
[22:00] blame him but by his own blood he
[22:02] entered into once into the holy place
[22:04] having obtained eternal
[22:06] redemption for us so you may be seated
[22:09] in the lord's blessing but remember what
[22:11] we're trying to get
[22:12] get to this plan of redemption
[22:17] is not changed can't change
[22:20] won't change will not change in
[22:22] midstream
[22:24] this is the plan the plan will work
[22:26] god's already saw it work
[22:28] why why in the world would you uh you
[22:31] know you
[22:31] you put your faith in this and you put
[22:33] your faith in in your car and i see some
[22:35] of y'all
[22:36] you know you you put faith in your car
[22:38] and your car maybe
[22:40] your mule kicks every once in a while
[22:42] and something part falls off
[22:44] but now with god his parts don't fall
[22:46] off this planet he has and once you get
[22:48] on it
[22:49] it's going to take you to the future
[22:50] home amen and then god knew that you
[22:53] would decide
[22:54] make the choice of whether to be a part
[22:57] of it or not
[22:58] so he having obtained eternal redemption
[23:00] for us
[23:01] and as we're going to read here in
[23:03] ephesians again as we always read
[23:05] because he told us he chose us in him
[23:08] so we were chosen in him but let's read
[23:10] the first quote from
[23:12] job 1955 brother brown says redemption
[23:14] is one of the oldest things in the bible
[23:17] did you know redemption was even before
[23:18] the planet of redemption was laid out
[23:20] before the world
[23:21] was ever formed think of that god
[23:23] foreseeing see there's always
[23:24] foreknowledge
[23:27] reason we have a problem with that word
[23:29] for knowledge
[23:31] because we don't have it
[23:36] i wish well sometimes not i wish we were
[23:38] foreknowing
[23:40] but god is he's not have a problem with
[23:42] that god foreknew
[23:44] he foreknew the plan he foreknew the
[23:46] destiny he for
[23:47] he foresaw what was going on and and
[23:50] like someone said he said i don't want
[23:51] to know what tomorrow holds he said
[23:54] i might not want to be there so see
[23:56] that's what brother brown
[23:57] tells us he said you know he said god
[23:59] gives us what we need
[24:02] but god saw down through 6 000 years of
[24:04] time
[24:05] what was going to happen who was going
[24:06] to be here who what choice they were
[24:08] going to make
[24:09] and even as brother dale was talking
[24:10] this morning i thought you know
[24:12] brother brown says and the bible tells
[24:14] us that your thoughts
[24:17] are louder in heaven than they are on
[24:19] earth why they've already been
[24:20] said up there they've already been said
[24:23] in the mind of god
[24:25] whatever your thoughts are you thought
[24:27] it before the foundation of the world
[24:32] in the mind of god not you standing up
[24:34] there thinking it
[24:35] but he knew when you got here what you
[24:37] would think amen so why be scared man
[24:40] the promises of god just
[24:41] hold on to the promises of god because
[24:44] the promises of god will never fail
[24:47] he'll lead us and guide us into what
[24:48] he's saying he promised us all truth not
[24:50] just part truth all truth
[24:52] all right so god foreseeing and making a
[24:55] way of redemption
[24:57] before he even made the world so see
[24:59] adam was covered eve was covered
[25:02] they were already covered before they
[25:03] got here right
[25:05] if not he would have had to kill adam
[25:06] just as soon as what they did and surely
[25:08] he would have killed eve without even
[25:09] asking adam
[25:14] because we're going to see that that
[25:15] when we get to this land of paradise
[25:18] see paradise is not the fifth dimension
[25:20] and paradise is not the sixth dimension
[25:24] paradise was a place of holding in the
[25:26] old testament to prove that they didn't
[25:28] have the new birth in the old testament
[25:30] i'll read it to you because the blood of
[25:32] bulls and goats wouldn't allow them to
[25:33] go into the
[25:34] sixth dimension or into a dimension
[25:36] higher they had to wait until christ
[25:38] died and when he did he what he emptied
[25:40] out paradise
[25:42] and we'll talk about that in just a
[25:43] minute but look at titus 1 verse 1
[25:46] says in hope of eternal life which god
[25:48] that cannot lie
[25:50] promised before the world began so when
[25:52] did god promise you eternal life
[25:54] before the world began when did he pay
[25:56] for your eternal life before the world
[25:58] began
[25:59] amen you've just got to connect yourself
[26:02] to it
[26:04] i like what one preacher said one time
[26:06] he said he said make sure that you have
[26:08] attached yourself to eternal life
[26:12] because you didn't come here with it you
[26:14] got to find it
[26:16] find god and attach yourself to it and
[26:19] once you attach yourself to eternal life
[26:21] then that means you're chosen in him so
[26:22] whatever he gets you get right
[26:24] and man that's why the bible tells us in
[26:26] romans he says we're what
[26:27] heirs and joint heirs
[26:30] in christ amen so whatever he gets we
[26:33] get
[26:34] so guess what if he had obtained if he
[26:37] has obtained eternal redemption for us
[26:40] we're the recipient of it and we enter
[26:42] into that
[26:44] and now you're a part of the plan of
[26:45] redemption because somebody's going to
[26:47] get redemption through you
[26:53] a cup of water in my name being good to
[26:55] the bride
[26:57] somebody's going to get eternal life by
[27:00] just being good to you now they won't be
[27:01] bribed they won't be living in the city
[27:03] but guess what
[27:04] they'll be eternal they won't be in a
[27:06] burning hell
[27:08] they will be eternal because of you so
[27:10] that makes you brother chris
[27:12] a part of the plan of redemption you're
[27:14] sisters
[27:16] you say well we don't preach you preach
[27:18] a sermon every time you get up out of
[27:19] the
[27:20] out of the chair and go get in a car and
[27:22] go down to walmart or go down to target
[27:25] or go down to wherever and you are an
[27:27] example
[27:28] of christianity
[27:33] and they'll either somebody be condemned
[27:35] by what they say about you or they'll be
[27:37] given eternal life by what they said
[27:38] about what you
[27:39] are doing on this earth thank god for
[27:43] that that's
[27:43] that makes you part of the plan man
[27:46] right
[27:48] you are part of the plan of redemption
[27:50] that's why the whole christ is the
[27:51] mystery of god reveal
[27:52] that's why that i believe that brother
[27:54] brown told us to go back to christ the
[27:55] mystery of god revealed if we didn't get
[27:57] it in the seals go to christ the mystery
[27:58] god revealed
[27:59] because it's what where's christ
[28:01] revealed amen
[28:03] in you paul even picked that up and he
[28:05] said christ in you the hope of glory
[28:08] to me that's the seventh seal is to
[28:09] realize that where christ is
[28:12] christ is in you
[28:15] christ in you the hope of god but how
[28:17] are we going to learn about this
[28:20] through preaching
[28:23] amen through preaching and studying
[28:26] right there it says in hope of eternal
[28:28] life which god that cannot lie promised
[28:29] before
[28:30] the world began but hath in due times
[28:32] manifested his word to preach in other
[28:34] words paul's saying
[28:35] he made the promise before the world was
[28:38] even formed
[28:39] but he's going to have to get it to you
[28:42] by some way
[28:45] he's got to come to you by some way it's
[28:48] got to come
[28:49] and even the bible tells us the
[28:51] foolishness of preaching
[28:53] because you would think oh man why do i
[28:55] have to that's the plan
[28:59] that's the plan you can't change it
[29:04] i was going to say a certain city can't
[29:06] change it but you know what i'm talking
[29:07] about
[29:08] and people can't change the word of god
[29:10] nobody can change the word of god
[29:12] through the foolishness of the five-fold
[29:14] ministry you will be perfected
[29:17] no other way amen
[29:23] too much too much complacency
[29:27] when you just have to press play as
[29:28] brother aaron was talking about
[29:29] wednesday night
[29:31] just a lot of complacency when you just
[29:32] kind of can sit somewhere and
[29:34] turn it off when you get tired you need
[29:36] to eat your potato chip or something or
[29:38] or change you know changing into your
[29:40] jammies and no
[29:41] it's an effort to overcome to get to
[29:43] church it's an effort i know it is
[29:46] and some of you drive a lot further than
[29:47] i do i think about this the other day
[29:49] some of you drive
[29:50] hour and a half sometimes two hours and
[29:52] you know we live eight miles away we
[29:54] we're fortunate in that to be that way
[29:56] but some of you
[29:57] it's a little bit more of a struggle but
[29:59] i believe god will give you a lot more
[30:01] blessings right you know god will bless
[30:03] you right
[30:04] hopefully it freaks your transmission
[30:07] well we all with transmission
[30:08] now what's going on here i think the
[30:10] sister johnny's check engine light came
[30:12] on
[30:13] several others around here but we're
[30:16] going to pray that you'll get to like
[30:18] tc we'll get them things fixed we won't
[30:21] have to deal with them no more
[30:22] ephesians one verse one or let's go to
[30:24] verse four
[30:26] according to us he has chosen us in him
[30:29] before the foundation of the world that
[30:30] we should be holy and without blame
[30:32] before him in love
[30:33] having predestinated us unto the
[30:35] adoption
[30:37] now brother dale i'm sure is going to
[30:38] cover this but you
[30:40] everybody's predestinated to adoption
[30:44] everybody because you receive according
[30:47] to romans 8
[30:48] verse about 14 or so it says you receive
[30:51] the spirit of adoption
[30:53] whereby you cry father father or daddy
[30:55] daddy
[30:56] you're a crime babbling baby you start
[30:58] out down at the bottom of the pyramid
[31:00] you start out with diapers you start out
[31:02] with
[31:02] drinking milk amen right
[31:06] but he doesn't want you to stay that way
[31:07] because he's given you
[31:09] he's predestinated someone to come to
[31:12] adoption
[31:13] so he had to make a way like they told
[31:15] the the the color brother you know he
[31:17] said well
[31:18] uh mose can you jump through that wall
[31:20] and he said well if
[31:21] he said if god wants me to he said he'll
[31:23] have to make a hole
[31:24] if god tells me to jump through the wall
[31:26] he'll have to make a hole for me to get
[31:28] through it
[31:29] so god made us a way to come to adoption
[31:33] right here verse 5 by jesus christ to
[31:36] himself according to the good pleasure
[31:39] of his will to the praise of the glory i
[31:40] was thinking this morning you know
[31:42] brother dale
[31:43] you're speaking on the predestination
[31:49] what's john 3 16
[31:53] for god so loved not one individual
[31:59] for god now he knows who won't who will
[32:01] but he's got to put the blanket out
[32:03] there
[32:04] because how many times have you heard
[32:06] that for god so
[32:08] loved the world he loved everybody in
[32:12] the world
[32:13] he has no haters there's no hatred
[32:16] towards somebody the the
[32:20] the part of it is is you're hating god
[32:23] i didn't like him too much when i was
[32:25] coming up i wanted to do the things that
[32:27] was contrary to him i don't know about
[32:28] you
[32:30] but i wanted to do them then you know
[32:32] what he took the one out
[32:35] when he took the one out and i attached
[32:37] myself to that eternal
[32:39] guess what paul says we must have the
[32:41] mind of christ
[32:42] not a mind of christ or not a part of
[32:46] the mind of christ that thought about
[32:48] adolf hitler and judas and all these
[32:49] different ones
[32:50] no you and i are literally a part of
[32:55] that thought
[32:57] we're not just the thought that goes out
[32:59] right as we're looking at in the fourth
[33:01] dimension it's not just that thought
[33:02] but we receive it and it becomes a
[33:04] reality
[33:06] what you receive on the books and the
[33:08] tapes and from preaching and from
[33:09] talking to brothers and sisters
[33:11] when it sparks a revelation in your
[33:13] heart that's eternal that didn't come
[33:15] from this first three dimensions you
[33:16] can't
[33:17] you can't communicate with god in these
[33:19] first three dimensions
[33:21] the devil's playground is right here
[33:24] because remember god is not in time
[33:29] god is in life but it's eternal life
[33:33] and god's also in matter because he made
[33:35] the world
[33:37] you look at the first verse god created
[33:40] the heaven and the earth he created
[33:43] matter before he created you
[33:45] something solid something that we can
[33:49] that he when he put adam on it there was
[33:50] adam
[33:52] and then adam got to walk on this matter
[33:55] but what happened though at the fall and
[33:57] i hope you're getting this when the fall
[33:59] happened
[34:00] it slowed everything down to where now
[34:04] the day you eat thereof that day you'll
[34:06] die
[34:07] you can't take your matter matter
[34:11] and take it into another dimension now
[34:13] adam couldn't move all the way around
[34:15] the world
[34:16] and be just have all control no he was
[34:19] confined because why
[34:21] a carnal mind began to tell him now he's
[34:24] got to be a daddy he's got to be
[34:25] he's got to be a father he's got to be a
[34:27] husband he's got to be this he's got to
[34:29] be that he was
[34:30] it just shrank down to where these
[34:32] dimensions that brother adam was telling
[34:34] us
[34:34] i pulled the quote up but i didn't bring
[34:36] it where there was a fog
[34:38] came over the earth and there was a fog
[34:39] came over adam
[34:41] basically between his soul and the rest
[34:43] of him because remember
[34:44] let me tell you something i was thinking
[34:46] about that this morning
[34:48] my brother dale was preaching something
[34:50] just struck about a virgin
[34:52] you know a virgin is you can say well
[34:55] i'm not a virgin
[34:56] if you're born again today you better be
[34:59] one
[35:00] but you're only virgin in your soul
[35:03] right your soul
[35:04] is a chaste virgin to christ one man
[35:07] amen now we came through all the other
[35:09] husbands that's why they all got to be
[35:11] dead
[35:12] right that's why that's got to die if
[35:14] that died do you know if a
[35:16] if a sister is married and her husband
[35:18] dies and she marries again she's a
[35:20] virgin
[35:21] amen now not like the catholic does it's
[35:23] not going to convert you back to a real
[35:25] one
[35:26] you understand what i mean but in god's
[35:28] eyes
[35:30] what a great god what if he just said no
[35:32] what if he just said no no way
[35:34] you've got to live single the rest of
[35:35] your life no he made provisions
[35:39] if your husband dies your wife died
[35:41] you're free to marry only in the lord we
[35:42] know those they're stipulations but
[35:44] still there is stipulations
[35:45] that you can do that well that's why
[35:48] that christ can be married to you
[35:50] when all your husbands are dead he can
[35:53] marry you and you're a virgin
[35:55] so in your soul you're we're all virgins
[35:57] in saul
[35:58] and god works in that soul right boy
[36:02] not in my notes but i'd like to preach
[36:04] on that for about two hours
[36:06] the virginity of your soul the purity
[36:10] right and you know what being a virgin
[36:11] you don't know a man you hadn't known a
[36:13] man yet so you don't know all the junk
[36:15] that needs to be
[36:16] right oh come on that's why paul said he
[36:18] said i wish that you could stay the way
[36:20] you are
[36:22] why he knew all the things that he said
[36:24] you know remember brother brown said
[36:26] he that brother brown talked about that
[36:27] he said well he paul said i wish the
[36:30] the boys would stay celibate and the
[36:32] women would stay celibate he said
[36:33] because
[36:33] then you have christ as your head then
[36:35] you have to put more into christ but
[36:37] once you get married you got a wife then
[36:40] you got an economy then you got
[36:41] friends and you got in-laws and then you
[36:44] got
[36:46] you understand what i'm saying
[36:50] it's not to say please if you want to
[36:52] get married if you have a desire please
[36:54] do
[36:55] it's the most wonderful thing in the
[36:57] world besides salvation is being married
[36:58] to a wonderful woman amen
[37:01] and the men said amen
[37:06] i don't know how i got onto that but
[37:08] we're we're on stealing ephesians one
[37:11] in whom we have redemption through his
[37:13] blood but see that's all part of it
[37:15] though
[37:15] because see you and i were dirty we were
[37:18] prostitutes
[37:20] but by the plan of redemption
[37:23] he has taken what was bad rahab
[37:27] woman at the well he has taken that bad
[37:31] and made it pure now he couldn't turn
[37:33] rahab back to a virgin but
[37:36] in type you and i were just like her
[37:41] we had all kind of thoughts seeds
[37:43] planted but when christ comes along when
[37:46] salman said
[37:47] where's your accuser she said i don't
[37:50] have any they're all dead
[37:52] right that's right jesus looked at that
[37:54] woman and said
[37:55] i can't even condemn you because i
[37:57] haven't seen it
[37:58] he doesn't see our sin he hears our
[38:02] voice
[38:04] this is all part of the plan of
[38:05] redemption
[38:08] in whom we have redemption through his
[38:09] blood the forgiveness of
[38:11] sins according to the riches of his
[38:13] grace wherein he has to bounded toward
[38:15] us
[38:16] in all wisdom and prudence
[38:19] having made known unto us
[38:23] not somebody else not another church age
[38:27] he's made known to us the mystery of his
[38:30] will
[38:32] and brother brown said what was his will
[38:33] to adopt us so we've come to the stage
[38:36] you heard where brother branham was
[38:37] on that tape where he's talking about
[38:39] luther being the two shoots couldn't
[38:41] come to total perfection now they were
[38:42] born again
[38:45] in the body of christ but that's not
[38:47] perfection you can't perfect
[38:49] you're not even got a seed yet but when
[38:51] you come
[38:52] even to the stalk not seed yet but the
[38:54] seeds inside of it come to the tassel
[38:56] not seed yet but it covers the seed but
[38:59] you and i are come back to where we have
[39:01] exactly what was planted in the ground
[39:03] two thousand years ago called jesus
[39:05] christ
[39:06] you and i are part of that we are that
[39:09] seed now
[39:11] and what are we doing with that seed
[39:12] we're planting it in
[39:14] soil we're planting it in earth
[39:19] and watching the fruits come up through
[39:21] justification sanctification and the
[39:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[39:26] the plan of redemption according to his
[39:28] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[39:30] himself
[39:31] look that in the dispensation of the
[39:33] fullness of times
[39:35] it took time it took time to go through
[39:38] the church ages it took time
[39:40] to get a prophet here on earth it took
[39:42] time that we could understand what a
[39:44] first seal was and the second seal on
[39:45] the third seal and all the different
[39:47] seals
[39:47] where we could understand the revelation
[39:50] that was
[39:50] what sealed up until the end time glory
[39:54] then in a disposition of the fullness of
[39:56] times he might gather together in one
[39:59] all things in christ in other words not
[40:01] not in 13 000 denominations
[40:04] in the message but one
[40:07] one both which are in heaven and which
[40:10] are on earth even
[40:12] in him in whom we also have obtained an
[40:15] inheritance
[40:16] being predestinated what according to
[40:18] the purpose of him who worketh all
[40:20] things
[40:21] after the council of his own will god
[40:23] knows down through time and he said okay
[40:25] you're going to need a martin luther
[40:26] okay you're going to need a john wesley
[40:28] okay you're going to need the baptism of
[40:30] the holy ghost on the day of pentecost
[40:31] 1906.
[40:32] then i'm going to send a prophet
[40:35] according to malecon 4
[40:36] we're going to need that
[40:41] listen we can sit and listen to a good
[40:44] justification message
[40:46] but what's that going to get us right
[40:48] it's not even going to put us in the
[40:49] body
[40:51] good justification message but if you'll
[40:53] preach a progression of justification
[40:57] it'll take you to what adoption amen
[41:00] those who he's justified he's already
[41:01] glorified but you know what it's not
[41:03] just a
[41:03] you don't just drop kick it into into
[41:05] heaven nope
[41:06] you got a what play the game right you
[41:09] got to get in the plan
[41:11] and listen this plan will work
[41:14] it's already worked if we'll realize
[41:17] that i'll read you a quote in a minute i
[41:19] think i may have left it i think i left
[41:20] it till later
[41:21] where brother brown said what do we fear
[41:26] it's all been destroyed by jesus christ
[41:33] it's all been destroyed when he came out
[41:36] of that grave
[41:38] he conquered death hell in the grave
[41:42] romans 8 28 we know all things work
[41:44] together good them to love the lord
[41:49] or love god to them who are be called
[41:53] according to his purpose for whom he did
[41:56] for no
[41:57] he also did predestinate i'm just going
[42:00] to read through this we've
[42:01] covered it brother dale's going to cover
[42:02] it real good on wednesday night
[42:04] also did predestinate what to be
[42:06] conformed to the image
[42:07] listen god didn't have to conform to
[42:10] your image
[42:11] your image is rotten my image was rotten
[42:15] the first image that came on this earth
[42:16] that i'm looking at is dying
[42:19] but if you're conformed to what to image
[42:20] the image of his son
[42:22] that he might be the firstborn among
[42:25] many brethren moreover whom he did
[42:26] predestinate them he also called
[42:28] whom he called he justified and whom he
[42:30] justified them he also
[42:32] glorified and then the next statement is
[42:35] god be for us who can be against us
[42:38] all right so let's read number one we've
[42:40] already read this before but
[42:42] i think brother dale may have read it
[42:43] this morning but the word predestinate
[42:45] that's not a good word to use the word
[42:47] for knowledge is better
[42:48] is everybody getting this i'll promise
[42:51] you look at man wake up
[42:55] there is a rotten wrong teaching in this
[42:57] message about predestination
[43:00] it's false it will lead you nowhere
[43:05] false doctrine cannot take you
[43:08] up that statue of a perfect man you
[43:12] can say what you want to you might get
[43:14] part of it
[43:17] who just wants part of god right
[43:21] i want everything he's got the door open
[43:23] for me and you the door's open
[43:25] the door's open for me and you you know
[43:27] what step in
[43:29] taste and see that the lord is good
[43:31] you've got to reach and get it off the
[43:32] table and put it in your mouth
[43:36] predestination looks back to foreign
[43:38] just what i mean you got to look for
[43:40] knowledge four no four new right four
[43:43] known
[43:44] 4c before anything he four knew
[43:50] he also forned you all these false
[43:52] doctrines too
[43:54] he foreign the good with the bad sorry
[43:58] you know why that way he can make sure
[44:00] that his plan works
[44:02] because he looks at the tactics of the
[44:04] devil
[44:06] and he's he's just his plan is going to
[44:07] work
[44:09] and you know what he's going to make the
[44:10] poor old devil
[44:13] he's a part of the plan because he's the
[44:15] one that torments me and you every day
[44:17] right
[44:18] he's the one that gets us he's the one
[44:20] that gets us
[44:22] and we have to repent we have to say i'm
[44:24] sorry
[44:29] god doesn't mind you saying i'm sorry he
[44:31] hates it when you don't
[44:33] amen or forgive me lord
[44:36] but god's not going to set an order a
[44:38] little whole did everybody understand
[44:39] that that's what brother dale was
[44:41] talking about
[44:41] god did not predestinate cement
[44:45] he didn't just say this is it right here
[44:48] going no other way
[44:49] no he saw what would happen
[44:53] he knew what you would choose therefore
[44:55] he could predetermine
[44:58] your destiny that's what pre-determined
[45:01] or predestinate
[45:03] but look he predestinated us to be
[45:06] conformed to his image
[45:09] there's a group of people that's why you
[45:11] can't say well now i'm predestinated so
[45:12] it doesn't matter what i do
[45:14] now that's one in doctrine in the
[45:16] message
[45:18] i'm predestinated i'm already in the
[45:20] millennium already i'm already this
[45:22] great something well then you get
[45:24] adulteries you get
[45:26] drunks you get sorry i see it i can name
[45:29] names
[45:30] because of these doctrines that's come
[45:32] through the message you know why because
[45:34] it's so close
[45:36] it's so close it makes you feel good
[45:38] makes you want to do other things
[45:40] no let's stay in the word of god if it's
[45:41] born to you then it just be born to you
[45:43] but
[45:44] the word of god is the word of god and
[45:46] the way it's taught around here we don't
[45:48] run the aisles and we don't scream and
[45:49] holler and
[45:50] and maybe you like that that's okay it's
[45:52] all right to get somebody in that does
[45:55] but what are you hearing what are you
[45:57] taking home
[45:59] what are you applying to your life
[46:06] i really would rather you sit and be
[46:07] quiet and listen
[46:09] i really would i like a little bit of
[46:12] shouting and emotion that's not bad at
[46:14] all don't
[46:14] get me wrong but can you sit down and
[46:18] tell me what i just said
[46:21] that don't happen a lot you can't do
[46:23] three things at once i promise you
[46:26] but anyway now where'd that come from
[46:31] but set an order like a little hole so
[46:33] see that's what god
[46:34] god then what predestinates by what not
[46:37] by his will
[46:38] by your will
[46:41] if god predestinated for god so loved
[46:44] the world
[46:46] that he gave his only begotten son and
[46:48] whosoever
[46:50] believes in him now look that's a big
[46:52] old blanket
[46:53] but now remember he knew who would and
[46:57] who wasn't but he can't just say
[46:59] for god so loved the world that ray
[47:01] gabriel's the only man that's going to
[47:02] get it
[47:04] and i'm going to send my son remember
[47:05] what brother brown says about that he
[47:07] says
[47:07] some people think that and i've heard it
[47:09] myself
[47:12] well jesus came down here to die and
[47:14] whoever
[47:15] felt sorry for him enough that's who he
[47:18] was going to save
[47:19] oh come on people good grief no he knew
[47:24] before the foundation's world who he is
[47:25] coming for but being god
[47:28] being a righteous judge
[47:31] bible calls him a righteous judge so in
[47:34] other words he's not a judge
[47:35] that is that is like the judge that you
[47:37] go to that couldn't make a mistake
[47:39] listens to two sides does not have
[47:42] foreign knowledge
[47:44] he has to take what evidence that he's
[47:47] given and sometimes a lawyer will give
[47:49] them false evidence
[47:51] nothing against lawyers but they lie
[47:54] they'd like to protect their client
[47:56] satan does that
[47:58] but god's already seen the end from
[48:00] beginning he already knows what happened
[48:03] he knows what's going to happen so in
[48:06] god in order to be god he knowed the end
[48:08] from the beginning so he could
[48:10] predict and set things in order to
[48:12] happen
[48:13] right you know god even before the
[48:17] foundation of the world
[48:19] he knew we'd want to go see the grand
[48:20] canyon he knew some people would love
[48:23] mountains he knew some people would love
[48:24] valleys he knew some people would love
[48:26] um oceans and seas and different things
[48:30] like that
[48:30] he knew that that's why he put it out
[48:32] here got of variety
[48:34] he's the one that made it all these
[48:36] different natural wonders
[48:38] why is there seven
[48:43] seven's completion he made seven natural
[48:46] wonders and nobody can make them things
[48:48] but god
[48:50] nobody can make them things and give man
[48:52] knowledge
[48:53] to do these things but seven natural
[48:55] wonders
[48:56] all right now here's a here's a wonder
[48:58] that that man has wondered at
[49:01] since the beginning of time number two
[49:03] how can i take a cuckleberry and make a
[49:04] grain of wheat out of it
[49:06] right impossible for me to do it
[49:09] the only way it can be done is because
[49:11] inside that cucumber has been
[49:13] transmitted from a cockaburr wheat
[49:16] a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat
[49:18] life
[49:19] then you bury that kookaburra it'll
[49:21] produce a grain of wheat
[49:23] that's the whole thing satan thinks he's
[49:24] got you boy he's got prophet's up there
[49:26] in
[49:26] jeffersonville and he's been dead for 60
[49:28] years and that kuckleberg is laying up
[49:30] there dead
[49:32] boy is he going to get a is he going to
[49:34] get a uh
[49:35] rude awakening when when the rapture
[49:39] gets red will not rapture but when the
[49:41] dead saints come out of the ground
[49:43] he's gonna go pick that kuckleberry up
[49:44] because it was transferred one day to a
[49:46] grain of wheat
[49:48] that grain of wheat is gonna pick that
[49:49] kuckleberry up and make it a wheat
[49:52] we're gonna come right back here brother
[49:53] tatum and all the different ones they're
[49:54] coming back they're not coming back as
[49:56] cuckoo birds
[49:57] they're coming back as sweet because the
[49:59] wheat is greater than the cucumber
[50:02] what's inside you today by the new birth
[50:04] is greater than anything
[50:05] man can produce on the face of this
[50:07] earth doesn't matter what it is
[50:10] and even though like if we get to it
[50:12] we'll get to if we don't we won't
[50:14] the fourth dimension listen you and i
[50:16] are barred from the fourth and the fifth
[50:17] dimension
[50:18] and the sixth dimension in this life
[50:21] we're barred from it can anybody here
[50:25] listen if you're hearing voices in your
[50:27] head we need to
[50:29] you need some prayer
[50:33] i mean really but you can't hear
[50:37] am 55 going through your head right now
[50:39] if you can then
[50:40] hold your hand up we're going to pray
[50:41] for you but can you no you're listening
[50:44] to me or you're listening somewhere else
[50:46] or your mind's over somewhere else right
[50:49] but it's going right through this
[50:50] building
[50:53] brother brown said radio waves going
[50:54] right through this building it doesn't
[50:55] matter about the thickness of the walls
[50:58] but it's going right through this
[50:59] building right
[51:01] but you can't pick it up see we're
[51:03] barred from it we've been barred from
[51:05] the sixth dimension
[51:06] brother branham was allowed to go beyond
[51:08] the curtain of time to tell us what he
[51:09] saw
[51:11] but he had to come back into this
[51:12] dimension and he died in this dimension
[51:14] he couldn't take this
[51:15] he couldn't take his natural body over
[51:17] to the sixth dimension
[51:18] no one's ever took their natural body
[51:20] why because cuckoo bird stays here
[51:23] the wheat's what goes in the other
[51:24] dimension because it's what it's christ
[51:29] that's right because there has been a
[51:30] life of wheat put in the kuckelberg
[51:33] and the life of the cuckoo bird has been
[51:34] taken out but the nature of the cocoa
[51:36] bear is still sticky he's talking about
[51:37] the outside guy
[51:39] and it will be until this new life has
[51:41] fully been developed now we've read that
[51:42] enough we know that
[51:44] when will that happen that will happen
[51:46] at the change but listen i'm going to
[51:47] tell you something
[51:48] we got to get so close to that
[51:52] in this life until the dead saints will
[51:55] come out of the ground by what we say
[51:58] that kookaburra may be standing there
[52:00] that's why that the devil he can't
[52:02] understand it you know we're all sitting
[52:03] here we're getting older
[52:05] we're all we're all have trials and
[52:08] tribulations
[52:09] and the devil's going why can't they
[52:11] just stay home
[52:13] why can't they just curse god and die
[52:16] why can't they just because that's all
[52:18] he knows
[52:20] he can't get in that inside of the
[52:22] inside of you
[52:24] he can't change that inside man once
[52:27] you've been what once that nature's been
[52:29] dead taken out of you and be alive the
[52:32] bible says in christ
[52:34] satan can't understand that why he's not
[52:37] been that's not happened to him because
[52:38] he decided that that's not what was
[52:39] going to happen to him
[52:41] amen pretty simple psalms 139 says my
[52:44] substance was not hid from thee when i
[52:46] was made in secret
[52:47] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[52:49] the earth you and i had to come to this
[52:50] earth
[52:52] we had to when what happened to adam and
[52:55] eve that
[52:56] stuck him in those three dimensions and
[52:58] then you had to have the sex act in
[53:00] that dimension because it never happens
[53:02] in any other dimension
[53:04] only in the first three time life and
[53:07] matter
[53:08] it happens in this dimension it can't
[53:10] happen in another dimension
[53:11] amen we have a spiritual birth
[53:15] a spiritual seed planting from now on
[53:19] but you've got to get here first by
[53:21] psalms 1 39-16 the knights did see my
[53:23] substance
[53:24] yet being unperfect and in thy book all
[53:27] my members were
[53:28] written which in continuance were
[53:30] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[53:32] them
[53:32] your name was written in the book of
[53:34] life before the foundation of the world
[53:38] because god knew you'd want it but see
[53:40] he knew that judas is carrot's name
[53:41] could be put in the book of life
[53:44] and be taken out because of the things
[53:47] he done
[53:47] while he got here and see a lot of the
[53:49] things you brother branham you know the
[53:51] brother brown tells you if you if you
[53:54] really break it down and we've we've
[53:55] done it over the years brother dale has
[53:57] not we brother they
[53:58] broke it down to us and even brother
[54:01] brown tells us he said
[54:03] when you become sanctified your name
[54:06] goes on the book as a believer
[54:07] well now it's it's an act of a play
[54:11] it's not an angel sitting up there going
[54:13] well now his name wasn't on here so i'm
[54:14] just going to write it on and then i'm
[54:16] going to erase it off if i need to
[54:18] no it's an acts of a play it's it's an
[54:20] allegory it's telling you what happens
[54:23] that you brother brown said your name
[54:25] goes on the book as a believer so you
[54:27] move into a believer mentality
[54:29] under sanctification but now that
[54:32] doesn't put you in the lamb's book of
[54:33] life that's been there before the
[54:34] foundation of the world and it's not
[54:36] going to ever be changed
[54:38] but you've got to move over into that
[54:41] and god knows whether you will or you
[54:43] won't
[54:44] really pretty simple all right let's
[54:47] look at the dimensions real quick light
[54:49] time and matter and he proved it in luke
[54:50] 16 verse 25
[54:53] let's go to that said but abraham said
[54:55] son remember
[54:56] that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy
[54:58] good things and likewise lives with evil
[55:00] things
[55:02] but now he is comforted and thou art
[55:03] tormented
[55:05] bless you and besides all this between
[55:07] us and you there's a great gulf fixed in
[55:09] other words
[55:10] there's something there but now remember
[55:12] they can see each other
[55:14] see in the in the old testament you got
[55:16] to remember
[55:17] there were several things that happened
[55:19] you look at the witch of endor
[55:21] i heard brother branham uh preaching the
[55:23] other day he said that some people said
[55:25] that
[55:25] that she just saw like an apparition
[55:28] brother brown said no she saw
[55:32] samuel because she said i see
[55:37] god's and said why have you told me this
[55:40] and there's their sin
[55:41] he said brother brown said there stood
[55:43] samuel in his
[55:44] prophet's robe had on his prophets
[55:47] clothes
[55:48] and he was standing there and it wasn't
[55:50] an apparition he said because that thing
[55:52] talked back to her
[55:54] and he prophesied still in another
[55:57] dimension in paradise
[55:58] he prophesied and looked at psalms said
[56:00] tomorrow you're going to be with me
[56:04] so how real is that but now brother
[56:06] brown said you can't do that now
[56:08] you can't bring somebody out of another
[56:10] dimension why
[56:12] because the the fifth dimension was set
[56:14] up the sixth dimension was set up
[56:16] later on when jesus christ i believe
[56:17] when he emptied up paradise see you
[56:19] can't do that anymore
[56:20] and and you know for those of you that
[56:22] went with us to jeffersonville a few
[56:23] years ago i'll just say this
[56:25] they used that as a as a scripture to
[56:27] bring brother branham back
[56:31] heard it with her own ears
[56:34] i just can't that's to me that's
[56:36] grabbing its straws
[56:38] that's old testament that's a witch
[56:42] bringing a prophet back how in the
[56:45] heavenly days do you want to get a witch
[56:47] to bring brother branham back
[56:49] but that was their whole pretense as
[56:51] well that happened back then it can
[56:52] happen now
[56:53] but remember that only happened under
[56:54] the blood of the bulls and goats that
[56:56] did not happen and cannot happen now
[56:59] because we'll look and read that
[57:00] paradise was emptied out
[57:02] when jesus came and went and preached to
[57:04] the souls in prison brother brown said
[57:06] he came right back up picked up
[57:07] paradise and took him into another
[57:09] dimension right
[57:10] everybody got that luke 17 says beside
[57:14] luke 16 says and besides all this
[57:16] between us and you there's a great gulf
[57:18] fixed
[57:19] so that they which would pass from hence
[57:21] to you cannot
[57:22] neither can they pass to us that would
[57:25] come from this in other words there's no
[57:26] way to cross back and forth
[57:29] into another dimension once you're dead
[57:32] you're dead i mean
[57:33] even though the witch of endor brought
[57:35] samuel
[57:36] up into this dimension it didn't change
[57:39] samuel
[57:40] right it really didn't change saul he
[57:43] was going to die the next day anyway
[57:45] right so it didn't change anything
[57:49] right and see it didn't change anything
[57:51] when brother brown went across the
[57:52] curtain of time because he had to come
[57:54] back into this dimension
[57:56] his soul went to that dimension his body
[57:58] didn't go
[58:00] that's right do i need to read it we've
[58:02] read it for years
[58:04] he said i look back and there laid my
[58:07] body
[58:08] on the bed so what was in the sixth
[58:11] dimension his soul
[58:13] somehow had transferred out of his body
[58:15] for mine in your
[58:17] for us not for anybody else but for our
[58:21] whatever for our information to take
[58:24] away the sting of death
[58:26] because paul said death we're just
[58:28] standing great for your victory now
[58:29] remember he went across the curtain of
[58:31] time
[58:31] but remember he only saw his people all
[58:34] right
[58:35] brother brown didn't see paul's people
[58:36] he only saw his people
[58:39] he said who are these branhams he said
[58:41] no they're your converts
[58:42] he said well did paul make it well you
[58:44] know what if paul was in that dimension
[58:46] he could have looked in saw paul
[58:48] he didn't see paul he saw his converts
[58:51] you will be gathered with your people
[58:54] right and brought before the lord the
[58:57] ones that will be last to be first the
[58:59] ones will be first to be last
[59:01] amen but it didn't change brother
[59:04] branham it changed him sure it changed
[59:06] him
[59:06] you understand what i mean it didn't
[59:08] change him where he had to stay over in
[59:09] this dimension
[59:11] actually he's been there he went over
[59:13] there to look and tell us
[59:14] but he had to come back and get back in
[59:16] that kookaburra again that his mom and
[59:17] daddy brought
[59:18] but he come to a place to realize that
[59:20] wasn't his real mama and daddy really
[59:22] you understand what i mean
[59:24] but then he had to physically die and
[59:26] that kuckleberg is laying up there and
[59:28] i hate to say that but that's just what
[59:30] we are every one of us paul
[59:32] kookaburr irenaeus martin that part that
[59:35] was brought here by mom and daddy having
[59:37] an act
[59:38] he's got to stay here but the soul is
[59:42] what's the important thing that's what
[59:44] moves between the dimensions
[59:46] that's what god can speed up and god can
[59:48] make faster
[59:50] we can't do it sure god's give us a
[59:54] radio or or whatever we want to
[59:57] say television to receive that
[1:00:00] information from another dimension but
[1:00:02] you and i are not going to go to that
[1:00:04] dimension
[1:00:05] we're not going to the fourth dimension
[1:00:08] we're either going to five or six you're
[1:00:11] not going to seven either
[1:00:13] because you're already in seven inside
[1:00:15] your soul
[1:00:17] sitting in heavenly places
[1:00:20] right let's
[1:00:23] don't don't let's don't be confused but
[1:00:26] we've got light
[1:00:28] time and matter now remember
[1:00:32] time will continue but one day time's
[1:00:34] going to run out right
[1:00:37] when we get into the future home
[1:00:38] there'll be no time
[1:00:40] amen but we're still going to have light
[1:00:42] and we're still going to have matter so
[1:00:43] it's not going to do away with all that
[1:00:45] but it's going to be a different kind of
[1:00:46] light it's not going to be a light that
[1:00:48] we need
[1:00:48] we need sunlight listen if we didn't
[1:00:51] have natural sunlight we'd die
[1:00:53] right natural sunlight if we didn't have
[1:00:56] spiritual sunlight
[1:00:57] spiritually you'll die wither up and die
[1:01:01] and let's pray that lord give us some
[1:01:03] sunshine i've had enough of this gloomy
[1:01:04] weather
[1:01:05] but if this is what god wants us to have
[1:01:07] but you know what we can pray
[1:01:10] you say how you just said that you can't
[1:01:12] change god knows whether you're going to
[1:01:14] pray or not
[1:01:16] god knows whether you're going to pray
[1:01:17] earnestly that it rain or play earnestly
[1:01:19] that it don't rain
[1:01:20] amen let's look at number two
[1:01:24] let's skip number one present stage of
[1:01:26] my ministry brother brown tells us about
[1:01:28] time
[1:01:29] light and matter
[1:01:33] you have five senses of the body see
[1:01:35] tastes filled smell and hair now none of
[1:01:36] these senses will declare god
[1:01:39] what did god give us those five senses
[1:01:41] for to declare the earth or to what
[1:01:43] contact with the earth now listen let me
[1:01:46] get this point to you
[1:01:48] that even though adam had to be put in
[1:01:51] the human body
[1:01:52] amen it wasn't that he was blind
[1:01:57] and then when god put him in a human
[1:01:58] body you could see
[1:02:01] no remember adam ruled the world
[1:02:04] not even in a flesh body yet
[1:02:08] spiritual body first then he put him in
[1:02:11] a natural body
[1:02:12] everybody got that same man amen
[1:02:16] put him in a natural body so that he can
[1:02:18] declare those senses
[1:02:20] to the earth but before then he could
[1:02:22] see
[1:02:23] and not like i think somebody said one
[1:02:26] time said well we didn't know about our
[1:02:28] senses
[1:02:29] well man look at him over in the sixth
[1:02:30] dimension brother brown said i felt them
[1:02:33] i knew they were women
[1:02:35] right when they hugged them but there
[1:02:36] was look there was no filial love there
[1:02:38] was no lust
[1:02:39] it was all agape love when you take all
[1:02:42] that other love out you can hug a sister
[1:02:45] don't try it now go see you're in this
[1:02:48] dimension
[1:02:49] still got to carnal minds kucleber still
[1:02:51] works amen
[1:02:53] but when we get over the other side he
[1:02:55] had feeling
[1:02:56] he had questions who is that right
[1:03:00] right and the lady said that 90 year old
[1:03:02] woman was
[1:03:03] was uh converted in your in your
[1:03:05] ministry and he said there she was a
[1:03:07] 18 year old beautiful woman so he had
[1:03:10] sea taste filled smelling here but it's
[1:03:12] greater than he had in this dimension
[1:03:14] and that's the same way with you and i
[1:03:16] this is just this is the so
[1:03:18] limited part of our listen this is the
[1:03:20] most limited you'll ever be
[1:03:23] even though we look at the advancement
[1:03:25] of science
[1:03:26] we might get in fourth dimension we may
[1:03:28] not
[1:03:29] but you look at the advancement of
[1:03:30] science and you see what they've done
[1:03:33] you know they got rockets now used to
[1:03:35] when they shot the rocket out you know
[1:03:37] the rocket would have to go at an angle
[1:03:39] and this part would drop
[1:03:40] off and this part would drop off and
[1:03:42] then it would come back
[1:03:44] and it would have to have a parachute
[1:03:45] and they'd have to go out there in the
[1:03:46] middle of the ocean and pick them up
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:49] they're not doing that now you see them
[1:03:51] the other day
[1:03:53] i think it was elon musk they got two
[1:03:55] rockets they fired them they went out
[1:03:56] went around the world come back
[1:03:58] and landed right on the same path that
[1:03:59] they that they went off on
[1:04:01] landed them things looked just like a
[1:04:03] pencil sticking up and they just
[1:04:06] landed it right back on earth technology
[1:04:10] do you know your cell phone well some of
[1:04:13] you
[1:04:14] maybe danny's flip phone i don't know
[1:04:15] about that but
[1:04:17] someone says what is a flip phone i saw
[1:04:20] one another day at walmart they were
[1:04:21] giving them away i think
[1:04:23] but uh you've got more technology in
[1:04:27] your phone today
[1:04:28] than was on the first lunar
[1:04:32] what they sent to the moon not just
[1:04:33] going around the world what they sent to
[1:04:35] the moon
[1:04:36] you've got more technology in your phone
[1:04:39] than they did
[1:04:41] taking them to the moon and back you've
[1:04:43] got it in your phone you see how much
[1:04:44] advance well now how far though i was
[1:04:46] thinking of the day how far advanced
[1:04:48] that is
[1:04:50] you're going to let the devil advance
[1:04:51] further than god
[1:04:54] if that happens in the natural you and i
[1:04:57] should end the spiritual
[1:04:59] we should be more advanced than we were
[1:05:02] before
[1:05:04] we should be able to hear from god
[1:05:07] brother brown said we would have
[1:05:09] supernatural
[1:05:10] intelligence be able to hear from god
[1:05:19] but none of these senses we got declares
[1:05:21] god when god made man he made him in his
[1:05:24] image instead of man's
[1:05:25] and he put him in five senses to contact
[1:05:27] his earthly home not to contact god with
[1:05:30] but now remember you've got to contact
[1:05:32] through that to get to god but remember
[1:05:34] what you see
[1:05:36] what you see is not all god you
[1:05:38] understand what i mean
[1:05:40] taste filled smelling here these senses
[1:05:42] don't declare god they declare the
[1:05:44] earthly home
[1:05:45] where the man had to contact his earthly
[1:05:47] home he had to see taste field
[1:05:49] in here but by but faith is the
[1:05:51] substance now see
[1:05:52] faith you can't see it you can't touch
[1:05:56] it
[1:05:57] you can't feel it you can't taste it
[1:06:00] literally you understand what i mean
[1:06:02] literally but by spiritual
[1:06:04] eye of faith by spiritual hearing by
[1:06:07] spiritual feeling
[1:06:10] and the bible says taste and see
[1:06:14] that the lord is good so there's your
[1:06:16] taste
[1:06:17] see taste phil smelling here but look
[1:06:20] by faith but faith is the substance of
[1:06:22] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:06:24] not seen
[1:06:25] you do not see it taste it feel it smell
[1:06:27] it or hear it but you believe it
[1:06:29] see what i mean now we're continuing a
[1:06:32] little bit further
[1:06:35] exodus 20 and john 12
[1:06:38] we see many times
[1:06:42] people saw the thundering and the
[1:06:43] lightning and the noise of the trumpet
[1:06:45] and the mountain smoke
[1:06:46] what was happening god was bringing
[1:06:49] the message to moses on the top of a
[1:06:52] mountain
[1:06:52] amen john 12 28 says father glorify thy
[1:06:56] name then came their voice from heaven
[1:06:57] saying i have both glorified it
[1:06:59] and will glorify it again how is he
[1:07:01] going to glorify it again in me and you
[1:07:04] amen we got to have a thunder sound in
[1:07:06] this message the people therefore that
[1:07:08] stood by though heard it
[1:07:09] that it thundered like brother chris
[1:07:12] said you know
[1:07:13] and i've met people this is oh we leave
[1:07:15] those seals along we leave those
[1:07:17] thunders along we don't know what
[1:07:21] you're not preaching the message then
[1:07:23] you're not preaching the message if
[1:07:25] you're not preaching the seals and the
[1:07:26] thunderstorm
[1:07:28] oh yeah you got little you got your milk
[1:07:32] but brother brown didn't come just to
[1:07:33] give us milk
[1:07:35] paul gave us milk
[1:07:38] but he said i like strong meat
[1:07:43] and that's what we got the people
[1:07:44] therefore stood by heard it listen
[1:07:47] we heard the thundering how many
[1:07:49] millions of people
[1:07:50] by the way of the fourth dimension has
[1:07:52] heard the prophet of god's voice
[1:07:54] millions untold millions upon millions
[1:07:57] have heard it
[1:07:58] they heard it in the time of the prophet
[1:08:00] and a lot of them will tell you that
[1:08:01] they just went to see the miracles
[1:08:08] yeah they'll tell you that if they're
[1:08:10] real honest they just went to see the
[1:08:12] miracles
[1:08:13] so they weren't hearing them sure they
[1:08:15] were hearing what was going on they were
[1:08:16] seeing what was going on
[1:08:17] but they weren't getting the message
[1:08:21] not in the years of preparation i mean
[1:08:22] brother diego was talking about it's not
[1:08:24] in the years of preparation
[1:08:26] but when he brings in other words when
[1:08:27] he thunders something that no one else
[1:08:29] can understand except the bride
[1:08:35] it's something for me and you the people
[1:08:37] around it are going to get
[1:08:38] thunder they're going to get hear a
[1:08:40] voice they're going to
[1:08:42] see this they're going to see lights
[1:08:44] flashing but do they hear the voice
[1:08:47] because that voice is not just to this
[1:08:49] ear
[1:08:51] it's to your spiritual here revelations
[1:08:53] 10 verse 1.
[1:08:54] so almighty angel this is all for me and
[1:08:56] you
[1:08:57] verse 4 and when the seven thunders had
[1:08:59] uttered their voices i was about to
[1:09:00] write in other words john saw what they
[1:09:02] said
[1:09:05] so if john can write it i ought to be
[1:09:08] able to understand it
[1:09:10] because john was born again believer
[1:09:12] just like i am but he did not have a
[1:09:14] prophet a seventh angel prophet
[1:09:16] telling him what they said we have had a
[1:09:19] seventh angel prophet messenger tell us
[1:09:21] what it said
[1:09:22] because of what happened
[1:09:26] out in arizona in 1962 we'll read that
[1:09:29] in a second but look jehovah jair in
[1:09:31] 1961
[1:09:33] they tell me when a plane is trying to
[1:09:35] get through the sound barrier
[1:09:36] it just almost shakes the bolts out of
[1:09:38] it have you ever watched
[1:09:40] when chuck yeager broke broke the sound
[1:09:42] barrier he thought the plane was going
[1:09:43] to fall apart
[1:09:45] but once he got through that 700 miles
[1:09:47] an hour
[1:09:48] broke the sound barrier he said it was
[1:09:50] just like
[1:09:51] floating on ice no nothing it's just
[1:09:54] getting through that one little and that
[1:09:56] was everybody see that's that barrier
[1:09:58] that everybody's afraid of because it
[1:10:00] starts shaking about 600 miles an hour
[1:10:03] and you think you're you think your
[1:10:04] plane's going to fall apart
[1:10:06] but look what brother brown said look it
[1:10:08] almost shakes the bolts out of it
[1:10:10] but after through that sound barrier
[1:10:12] it's all right
[1:10:13] then it can just run with ease if we can
[1:10:15] just break through that static
[1:10:17] of superstition and things then the holy
[1:10:20] spirit just begins to fall around like
[1:10:22] anointing and just blesses the people
[1:10:25] but so many people of today are so
[1:10:28] babied
[1:10:29] just petted little petty
[1:10:32] what once the ship starts shaking the
[1:10:35] rats get off first
[1:10:37] sorry about that
[1:10:41] who's the first one off anyway
[1:10:46] but see man had come to a natural thing
[1:10:48] that he came to that sound bear they
[1:10:50] would always they'd get to that 600 mile
[1:10:51] an hour spot
[1:10:52] and they'd back off they'd get to that
[1:10:55] 600 mile an hour spot maybe 620 and
[1:10:58] they'd think man this
[1:10:59] my life's gonna fall apart everybody get
[1:11:01] everybody with me now
[1:11:03] my life's gonna fall apart because
[1:11:05] everything's shaking
[1:11:08] but if they would have only went
[1:11:12] i think it's 620 miles an hour is when
[1:11:14] it really starts shaking
[1:11:15] if they'd only went just push the
[1:11:17] throttle
[1:11:19] that's what chuck yeager did he said i
[1:11:21] just made myself
[1:11:24] push the throttle because he still had
[1:11:26] throttle left
[1:11:28] he said i made myself force that
[1:11:29] throttle he said when i did when i hit
[1:11:31] that 800 mile he said that thing went
[1:11:33] kaboom
[1:11:34] everybody heard it he said but it was
[1:11:35] just like flying
[1:11:37] on ice he said there was no bumps
[1:11:40] you see it was just smooth sailing is
[1:11:43] that what me and you've come up to
[1:11:45] is that what men you've come up to in
[1:11:47] our life
[1:11:48] just remember just a few more miles an
[1:11:51] hour
[1:11:52] just to press that throttle just a
[1:11:54] little bit more listen when things get
[1:11:55] hard
[1:11:56] press the throttle right yeah how you
[1:11:59] want to get out of a shaking car
[1:12:00] donnie how you want to get out of
[1:12:01] shaking car that that salad you know
[1:12:03] that thing will get about 60 miles an
[1:12:05] hour and hear that thing will start
[1:12:06] going thinking
[1:12:06] i gotta because your wheels are out of
[1:12:08] balance but what you either back off
[1:12:11] or go 70. let's go 70.
[1:12:15] right let's push through this thing i
[1:12:18] know some people are worried about the
[1:12:19] virus and people are worried about these
[1:12:20] different things
[1:12:21] humanly we all should be worried we
[1:12:23] should all be cautious
[1:12:24] but still we if we don't push through
[1:12:26] this thing
[1:12:28] just like chuck yeager he said i knew
[1:12:30] there was more throttle
[1:12:32] listen there's more to this then what
[1:12:35] we're seeing
[1:12:37] there's more throttle have you ever seen
[1:12:39] a i'm
[1:12:40] you don't have to forgive me i'm
[1:12:43] watching airplane videos
[1:12:45] i may want to try to fly an airplane one
[1:12:46] day but anyway you got a throttle
[1:12:49] and you push that thing all the way to
[1:12:51] the front ryan's downstairs he knows
[1:12:53] what i'm saying
[1:12:53] that throttle goes all the way in well
[1:12:56] that's your takeoff speed
[1:12:58] but you don't keep that throttle up
[1:12:59] there to blow the engine up you have to
[1:13:01] back the throttle back off some
[1:13:03] but what chuck yeager he said i looked
[1:13:04] down he said i saw there was about two
[1:13:06] or three more inches of throttle
[1:13:09] and he said i just he went through the
[1:13:12] sound barrier and see now that was only
[1:13:14] 700 miles an hour
[1:13:15] a regular airplane that you fly flies at
[1:13:18] about 500 miles an hour
[1:13:19] so it's normal now i mean you got
[1:13:24] jet fighters that fly at 1500 miles an
[1:13:27] hour
[1:13:28] so they're twice what chuck yeager was
[1:13:30] why because the advancements of
[1:13:31] technology
[1:13:34] you have artificial intelligence now
[1:13:35] that all flies the plane for you
[1:13:37] right brother brown says here let's just
[1:13:41] condense this down
[1:13:42] number four reason i'm saying this i
[1:13:44] want you to know what happened in this
[1:13:45] end time
[1:13:47] what broke a sound barrier in this end
[1:13:49] time no other time
[1:13:51] the wright brothers 30 miles an hour in
[1:13:53] a pedal bicycle run off of
[1:13:55] kitty hawk and made it about 100 feet
[1:13:58] at 30 miles an hour with a bicycle you
[1:14:01] know
[1:14:02] twirling the propellers
[1:14:05] then you had the old stop with camel
[1:14:07] that you
[1:14:08] had won i mean it was maybe 100 miles an
[1:14:10] hour
[1:14:11] then you come up with a jet engines and
[1:14:13] then you come up and you got now
[1:14:14] supersonic
[1:14:16] right they just those two rockets was
[1:14:20] like at 14 000 miles an hour 14 000
[1:14:22] miles an hour
[1:14:24] wow
[1:14:27] there was a blast let's go on down he's
[1:14:29] talking about the birds watch it was
[1:14:30] little birds bigger birds
[1:14:32] no sooner that day got out of my sight i
[1:14:34] turned again westward what happened
[1:14:36] there was a blast that shook the whole
[1:14:38] earth what was happening
[1:14:39] the sound barrier was being broke
[1:14:43] by a supersonic jet they can call
[1:14:46] whatever that is they want to
[1:14:49] it wasn't a jet it was god
[1:14:52] coming into this dimension to give us
[1:14:55] something that's never been here before
[1:14:58] they've never had a cloud like this but
[1:15:01] every time you break the sound barrier
[1:15:03] you look at the pictures
[1:15:04] when that thing goes at 700 miles an
[1:15:06] hour there's a cloud forms all the way
[1:15:08] around the airplane
[1:15:10] oh hallelujah there's a
[1:15:13] there's a it's around us now you just
[1:15:16] gotta see it
[1:15:19] you say brother wade that's wrong no the
[1:15:21] bible says a great
[1:15:23] cloud of witness we've got it all around
[1:15:27] us why because we're breaking the sound
[1:15:29] barrier
[1:15:31] how do you think we're going to get out
[1:15:32] of here we're going to have to break
[1:15:34] some kind of barrier to leave this earth
[1:15:39] not leave just step over into a faster
[1:15:41] dimension right
[1:15:42] right that was a blast that actually
[1:15:45] shook the whole earth
[1:15:46] for those of you on tape if you don't
[1:15:49] believe this you turn it off
[1:15:52] okay i'm giving you time i'm gonna take
[1:15:54] a drink of water
[1:16:00] first a blast thought it sounded like a
[1:16:03] sound barrier
[1:16:05] ever what you call it when planes cross
[1:16:06] the sound the sound comes back to the
[1:16:08] earth
[1:16:09] just shook like roared everything then
[1:16:11] it could have been a
[1:16:12] a great clap of thunder
[1:16:16] and lightning light i didn't see the
[1:16:18] lightning i just heard that great blast
[1:16:21] that went forth that sounded like it was
[1:16:22] south from me
[1:16:24] towards mexico but it shook the earth
[1:16:26] and when it did i was still looking
[1:16:28] westward
[1:16:29] and way off into where eternity
[1:16:32] i saw a constellation of something
[1:16:34] coming it looked like it might have been
[1:16:36] little dots remember brother brown said
[1:16:39] i sat up there in the woods and he said
[1:16:41] i want to get something from god he said
[1:16:42] 2 times 2 is 4. 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2
[1:16:46] is 4 2 includes 4.
[1:16:47] what coming down into this dimension
[1:16:49] faster
[1:16:50] from a faster place into this place
[1:16:52] that's why i believe that cloud came
[1:16:55] those angels came from an eternal
[1:16:57] dimension into this dimension
[1:17:00] there could have been no less than five
[1:17:01] no more than seven but they were in the
[1:17:03] shape of a pyramid like these messengers
[1:17:05] coming
[1:17:06] and when it did the power of almighty
[1:17:08] god lifted me up to meet them
[1:17:11] he's the only man that could have
[1:17:12] survived that if not somebody else would
[1:17:15] have
[1:17:16] and i can see it it's never left me
[1:17:18] eight days is gone and i can't forget it
[1:17:20] yet i never had anything to bother me
[1:17:22] like this
[1:17:23] my family will tell you i could see
[1:17:25] those angels those shaped back wings
[1:17:26] traveling faster than
[1:17:28] sound could travel they came from
[1:17:30] eternity
[1:17:32] listen what we got
[1:17:35] the message we got came from eternity
[1:17:42] in a split like a twinkling of an eye
[1:17:44] that bible
[1:17:46] not enough to bat your eye just to
[1:17:47] twinkle they were there
[1:17:49] i didn't have time to count we know
[1:17:51] there were seven afterwards
[1:17:53] he comes back and tells it again i don't
[1:17:55] have time no more than just look
[1:17:56] mighty ones great powerful angels snow
[1:17:58] white winged set heads
[1:18:00] and they were and when it did i was
[1:18:03] caught up into this pyramid
[1:18:05] a constellation they came into light
[1:18:09] time and matter
[1:18:11] and it made a noise it created a cloud
[1:18:23] but was it the picture that was took
[1:18:27] or was it the experience that he had
[1:18:28] that you and i are looking at
[1:18:30] right no
[1:18:34] we're looking at the voice that came
[1:18:35] behind it
[1:18:37] we're looking at the voice that came
[1:18:38] into this light time and matter and was
[1:18:41] put on recording tape and that you and i
[1:18:44] can hear it
[1:18:45] and it's the voice of god speaking to us
[1:18:53] thank you lord that we're recipients of
[1:18:56] that because you know what
[1:18:57] there's a group of people said that's
[1:18:58] false there's a group of people said
[1:18:59] that was just a regular rocket a group
[1:19:01] of people don't even know that that even
[1:19:02] exists
[1:19:03] when you look at people and you go to a
[1:19:05] flea market and you go
[1:19:07] hey you got a time magazine is it time
[1:19:09] or life
[1:19:10] time you got time magazine 1963
[1:19:14] you know whatever it is and they're
[1:19:15] going
[1:19:17] dude i wasn't even born back then why
[1:19:20] because it doesn't mean nothing to them
[1:19:21] but to you and me
[1:19:24] how much would we pay to get one
[1:19:27] somebody want to say how much they paid
[1:19:28] to get one
[1:19:31] i think it's up in about 300 now just to
[1:19:33] buy a 25 cent
[1:19:36] why because it means something to us
[1:19:39] but listen it means nothing if you ain't
[1:19:41] got the voice behind it
[1:19:43] because remember this whole thing
[1:19:47] that whole scene don't turn it that
[1:19:48] whole scene was to take brother branham
[1:19:51] and put him in a position of adoption if
[1:19:54] you want to say that
[1:19:55] and but he told him to go back to
[1:19:57] jeffersonville
[1:19:59] the seals were not revealed out there in
[1:20:01] arizona
[1:20:03] he said go they said go back to
[1:20:05] jeffersonville it'll be told you then
[1:20:07] what to do
[1:20:08] but he had to have an experience first
[1:20:11] knowing that it came from eternity
[1:20:14] and that he was going to get a message
[1:20:16] that was going to break a group
[1:20:18] of people out of this three dimensions
[1:20:24] and get us out of here
[1:20:27] because the seals are the full plan of
[1:20:28] redemption not just part
[1:20:31] it's the full plan of redemption
[1:20:35] everybody okay say amen
[1:20:38] all right let's let's just do the fourth
[1:20:40] dimension and we'll do the fifth later
[1:20:41] on
[1:20:45] brother bob you won't have to pull up
[1:20:47] all that
[1:20:49] but if you got your little things here
[1:20:51] you can look on it says fourth dimension
[1:20:53] is the tree of knowledge and see that
[1:20:55] fourth dimension is where all that
[1:20:57] knowledge
[1:20:58] is science if you look here at science
[1:21:01] or the tree of knowledge brother brown
[1:21:03] tells us that man has what broken into
[1:21:06] god's laboratory
[1:21:09] because when you look in this fourth
[1:21:10] dimension that's where i
[1:21:12] picked up a bunch of things i'm going to
[1:21:14] read a few of them to you
[1:21:16] it's really interesting then we'll close
[1:21:20] we'll pick this up next time
[1:21:23] brother i'm number five let's read
[1:21:25] present stage in my ministry
[1:21:28] now but we have contact through science
[1:21:29] the fourth dimension as it was
[1:21:31] because coming right through this
[1:21:32] building now comes pictures voices of
[1:21:34] radio
[1:21:35] pictures on television that our senses
[1:21:38] does not contact that
[1:21:40] but yet they have a tube or a crystal
[1:21:42] that picks up those ether waves
[1:21:44] and manifests them so you see right in
[1:21:46] this building now
[1:21:47] it's live actions of people in the air
[1:21:50] live voices
[1:21:52] they're here they're absolutely the
[1:21:53] truth and the only thing you do
[1:21:56] they catch it on i don't understand the
[1:21:58] mechanics of these things that science
[1:22:00] has embedded
[1:22:01] but we know that it proves to us that
[1:22:02] there is a fourth dimension now we know
[1:22:05] there is a fourth dimension why because
[1:22:07] you turn on radio you're going to talk
[1:22:09] on a cell phone
[1:22:11] you go to the internet right if you're
[1:22:13] on the internet with wi-fi
[1:22:15] you're not connected to anything
[1:22:17] remember when brother branham even
[1:22:19] you take 1945 i was looking into
[1:22:23] even the principles of radio was in the
[1:22:26] 1880s
[1:22:27] 1880s the principle i said not the radio
[1:22:31] the principle of it
[1:22:32] but remember in 1945 you look at the
[1:22:35] tree of knowledge
[1:22:37] every time there's a war there's an
[1:22:38] advancement after the war why
[1:22:40] because they bring the greatest
[1:22:42] scientists they have they bring the
[1:22:43] greatest people they have
[1:22:44] and they put them together and say look
[1:22:46] we need this
[1:22:48] then when world war ii was after over
[1:22:50] 1945 when did brother brown start
[1:22:52] preaching in 1947 they already had
[1:22:54] radio so now that he can have that radio
[1:23:00] or that wire thing or that new
[1:23:02] advancement he calls it
[1:23:05] so god is letting us use the tree of
[1:23:06] knowledge of good and evil but man has
[1:23:08] used it to bring
[1:23:09] what to bring all the raw things
[1:23:12] i was thinking the other day you know
[1:23:15] even in 1962
[1:23:18] you look at what brother branham was
[1:23:20] talking about going through now sure
[1:23:21] there was
[1:23:22] how many of you remember 19 even 1968
[1:23:25] and 70 there was only four channels
[1:23:29] right four television channels two five
[1:23:31] eleven and if you got the antenna turned
[1:23:33] the right way you might get green for
[1:23:35] one every once in a while and you can
[1:23:36] watch wrestling on saturday morning
[1:23:38] hello somebody didn't miss that
[1:23:44] wrestling that was channel four
[1:23:47] but you had to turn the you had to turn
[1:23:49] you had to go outside and turn that
[1:23:51] you see what that was from the 60s now
[1:23:52] look at we've got what
[1:23:54] six 800 channels now that they got look
[1:23:56] at what we have to deal with and
[1:23:58] you you don't think i'm an idiot but
[1:24:00] listen
[1:24:02] brother branham when he was there in the
[1:24:03] 40s think of the airwaves wasn't full of
[1:24:06] a lot of stuff
[1:24:09] understand what i mean there was no
[1:24:10] internet there was no cell phones
[1:24:13] didn't even have shortwave radios except
[1:24:15] the government had them but you didn't
[1:24:16] have them
[1:24:17] so when he said there was people going
[1:24:19] through here in 1963 even he talks about
[1:24:22] and on the sixth seal i believe it was
[1:24:24] he's talking about voices going through
[1:24:25] this room people
[1:24:26] going through the room it wasn't so full
[1:24:30] think about right now how many billions
[1:24:33] of cell phones there are and billions i
[1:24:35] mean billions there's not millions
[1:24:36] there's billions of cell phones
[1:24:38] that are on now
[1:24:41] well according to your pastor you better
[1:24:42] not have them on right now
[1:24:44] but if you you know what though if you
[1:24:45] turned your phone on i could call
[1:24:48] jamaica stand right here and talk to
[1:24:50] brother keith reed
[1:24:52] right so his voice must be in this room
[1:24:56] somewhere
[1:24:58] but the same guy that's watching
[1:24:59] pornography two doors down i don't know
[1:25:01] who he is
[1:25:02] doesn't matter but you know what i'm
[1:25:03] saying that's going through here too
[1:25:08] what brother branham saw he knew we
[1:25:11] would have to overcome all that
[1:25:13] but you know what so did god right god
[1:25:16] knew we would have to be equipped
[1:25:18] totally different
[1:25:19] we had to be the astronaut that wore the
[1:25:22] helmet that wore the pressurized suit
[1:25:26] and you know even in advancement you
[1:25:28] know they got up so far flying an
[1:25:30] airplane
[1:25:31] and you get up to whatever how many
[1:25:32] thousand feet 12 15 18 000 feet and your
[1:25:34] oxygen runs out
[1:25:36] a lot of airplane pilots died because
[1:25:38] they tried to get on up a little bit
[1:25:39] higher and they didn't have any oxygen
[1:25:41] well then the government comes up with
[1:25:43] the oxygen tank with a little
[1:25:44] it wasn't nothing but a tube you stuck
[1:25:47] the tube in your mouth
[1:25:49] and you got fresh oxygen so you could
[1:25:50] get up to 20 000 feet but they were
[1:25:52] freezing themselves to death because it
[1:25:54] was like five degrees up there
[1:25:55] but now guess what you and i fly 35 and
[1:25:58] 40 thousand feet just in a regular
[1:26:00] jetliner we're sitting there with
[1:26:02] slippers on watching a television
[1:26:04] playing on our cell phone and eating a
[1:26:06] meal
[1:26:09] look at the difference that tree of
[1:26:12] knowledge
[1:26:13] of good and evil let's read this next
[1:26:15] quote and then we'll
[1:26:17] read two quotes and then we'll stop
[1:26:20] countdown 1962. now we have known
[1:26:24] there's another dimension which is the
[1:26:25] fourth dimension
[1:26:26] because science has probed into it and
[1:26:28] found it and it is radio
[1:26:30] there's no senses of our body can detect
[1:26:33] radio or television
[1:26:35] over that ether wave yet right through
[1:26:37] us now is coming people's voices
[1:26:40] and i'll tell you how fast it is in just
[1:26:42] a minute right through here is coming
[1:26:44] television pictures
[1:26:46] but we have nothing in us no way at all
[1:26:48] to contact that in our self
[1:26:50] it takes a crystal of some for some sort
[1:26:53] now some of you young kids don't realize
[1:26:55] it
[1:26:55] but when we were all growing up you know
[1:26:59] why it's am 55.5 and 79 and 97 and 104.7
[1:27:04] megahertz because in the old radios
[1:27:09] donnie what'd you have diamonds real
[1:27:12] diamonds little bitty teeny tiny ones
[1:27:14] but they were cut
[1:27:15] a certain way and that's what picked up
[1:27:18] a certain radio so it was either 104
[1:27:20] cut for 104.7 because remember those of
[1:27:22] you that's old enough
[1:27:23] brother gage krantz knows what i'm
[1:27:25] talking about
[1:27:27] how many remembers when am fm was a
[1:27:29] option
[1:27:30] in a car how many can't remember when
[1:27:32] air conditioning was an option in a car
[1:27:36] a motor oh no
[1:27:39] but these kids don't realize that you
[1:27:41] could get standard
[1:27:42] am with no air conditioning no power
[1:27:45] steering
[1:27:48] and when have you ever done one of this
[1:27:49] one window
[1:27:51] okay some of you so not old enough to
[1:27:54] know that
[1:27:56] but that was an option but the radio was
[1:27:58] actually a dial
[1:27:59] and it physically dialed it it
[1:28:01] physically pushed a little
[1:28:03] red line across and what happened was is
[1:28:05] you would hit that crystal that was in
[1:28:07] that radio
[1:28:08] well that crystal was cut at a certain
[1:28:10] ohm
[1:28:11] and that certain ohm was what was in the
[1:28:13] air the certain wave
[1:28:15] and that's what picked that up of course
[1:28:17] now it's done been coming digital and
[1:28:19] all this other stuff but
[1:28:20] listen that's how it got started and
[1:28:23] look what it is now
[1:28:24] you don't have no you don't have a
[1:28:25] diamond in there you don't have to
[1:28:28] put a vic trolling needle in if you ever
[1:28:30] we used to have to change them needles
[1:28:32] old vic trolling needle you know because
[1:28:33] it just sit there and bounce
[1:28:35] play the same same song all over again
[1:28:37] skip three or four times
[1:28:40] they're coming back now anybody seen
[1:28:41] those things they're coming back now
[1:28:43] yeah all that stuff the deanna's got an
[1:28:45] old radio we bought her and it
[1:28:47] of course it's got all the advancements
[1:28:49] in it but it looks like one of them old
[1:28:50] radios
[1:28:50] and then she now she wants a 45. um
[1:28:53] she's got one
[1:28:54] doesn't she yeah she's got one but
[1:28:56] anyway all that old stuff comes back
[1:28:57] don't worry
[1:28:59] but it ain't got the technology that it
[1:29:00] had before
[1:29:02] and in a television you've heard brother
[1:29:06] dale
[1:29:06] and honestly the television was as big
[1:29:08] as this thing right here and the screen
[1:29:10] was about the size of that right there
[1:29:13] and you had tubes and it was hot man it
[1:29:16] was hot
[1:29:18] they were yeah there were tubes about
[1:29:19] that big around that it had light and
[1:29:21] you plugged them in or
[1:29:22] you had somebody come by and work on
[1:29:23] them you know you understand what i'm
[1:29:24] saying
[1:29:25] look at the advancement that fourth
[1:29:28] dimension has always been there but man
[1:29:30] has now been able to tap into it now
[1:29:32] totally unlimited can tap into it put
[1:29:36] 600
[1:29:37] one television and put 600 channels
[1:29:39] through that one television
[1:29:40] internet service you get 10 000
[1:29:44] youtube videos comes right through your
[1:29:46] house right into your little device
[1:29:49] you know what use that for god
[1:29:53] say god i am now a receptor
[1:29:57] i'm not just a cut diamond i'm a
[1:29:59] receptor please
[1:30:02] give me that give me that knowledge not
[1:30:06] always off the tree of life but the
[1:30:07] knowledge off of god
[1:30:09] pray and read your bible that's pretty
[1:30:12] tough
[1:30:14] there's no sense in our body can detect
[1:30:16] it but we have nothing in us no way at
[1:30:17] all to contact that in ourselves
[1:30:19] it takes a crystal of some sort a magnet
[1:30:22] to contact that but it speaks that there
[1:30:24] is another dimension
[1:30:25] now that's four dimensions now let's go
[1:30:27] to enticing spirits 1955.
[1:30:30] now this morning we're going to talk
[1:30:31] about demons in spiritual form in the
[1:30:33] soul
[1:30:34] they're in the soul the same as they are
[1:30:36] in the body and we're bound to admit
[1:30:38] that we see them in people's body look
[1:30:40] at this now
[1:30:42] such as cancers and different diseases
[1:30:45] that's in the human body just recently
[1:30:48] even cancer has been declared to be a
[1:30:50] fourth
[1:30:51] dimension disease that it's in another
[1:30:54] dimension sure
[1:30:55] it's demonology every disease is a
[1:30:59] fourth dimension
[1:31:00] disease the beginning of it right
[1:31:04] that's why my brother adam could stand
[1:31:05] there remember what's the first thing
[1:31:07] happened
[1:31:07] the first sign he got was what vibration
[1:31:11] in his hand remember he said the
[1:31:14] vibration is gone remember it would
[1:31:15] pimple up and all these different things
[1:31:16] but what was it
[1:31:17] vibration he said lady the vibration is
[1:31:21] gone your sickness is over
[1:31:22] right it was a vibration what it was
[1:31:24] another dimension those demons were he
[1:31:26] said oh can't you hear that demon that
[1:31:28] lady's got cancer over there and this
[1:31:29] lady's got cancer
[1:31:30] there's a black line going from one to
[1:31:32] the other and there's two demons
[1:31:33] screaming at each other for help
[1:31:35] what dimension was he in he wasn't in
[1:31:37] this one
[1:31:38] he was in the fourth dimension because
[1:31:40] he was a prophet
[1:31:42] any other time he wouldn't see all that
[1:31:45] but most of the time he he would always
[1:31:48] say i don't know what dimension i'm in i
[1:31:49] don't know where i'm at
[1:31:52] thank god you and i don't have to go
[1:31:53] through that but let me read you this
[1:31:55] real quick
[1:31:56] you don't have that on there we'll we're
[1:31:58] going we're going to talk about hell
[1:32:00] next
[1:32:01] time because hell is not a burning place
[1:32:03] at this moment we know that
[1:32:05] hell is a place of holding it is a place
[1:32:08] reserved in the fifth dimension
[1:32:12] brother brown said you're caught between
[1:32:14] heaven and hell i'm in heaven and
[1:32:16] heaven and earth you can't get back to
[1:32:17] earth you can't go to heaven
[1:32:19] but we'll cover that next time i want to
[1:32:21] read this it's not on there so just
[1:32:22] listen to what i'm saying i got this off
[1:32:24] i
[1:32:24] got this off the internet radio waves
[1:32:28] are a type
[1:32:28] of electromagnetic radiation
[1:32:32] best known for their use in
[1:32:34] communication technologies
[1:32:36] such as television mobile phones and
[1:32:38] radios
[1:32:39] these devices receive radio waves and
[1:32:42] convert them
[1:32:43] to mechanical vibrations
[1:32:46] in the speakers to create sound waves
[1:32:51] it's in waves listen to this the radio
[1:32:55] frequency spectrum
[1:32:57] is a relatively small part of
[1:32:59] electromagnetic spectrum
[1:33:02] the electromagnetic spectrum is
[1:33:04] generally
[1:33:06] divided into seven regions
[1:33:11] wake up this don't enter you can go
[1:33:13] outside
[1:33:16] seven regions
[1:33:20] hmm
[1:33:23] in order of decreasing wavelength and
[1:33:25] increasing
[1:33:26] energy and frequency according to the
[1:33:28] university of rochester
[1:33:30] the common designations are radial waves
[1:33:34] microwaves infrared ray
[1:33:38] visible light ultraviolet
[1:33:41] x-rays and gamma rays guess where we're
[1:33:44] stuck
[1:33:44] at out of those seven we're stuck right
[1:33:47] in the middle
[1:33:49] visible light's the only thing we can
[1:33:50] see and what is invisible light
[1:33:54] i mean visible light all the other is
[1:33:57] invisible we can't see them
[1:33:59] but we can see visible light
[1:34:02] oh come on yeah
[1:34:05] we see seven colors
[1:34:12] god not only put that in the sky back in
[1:34:16] noah's time he was telling us that's
[1:34:19] what you're going to see
[1:34:20] that's all you're going to see you're
[1:34:22] going to see because that
[1:34:23] the seven colors of the rainbow income
[1:34:25] passes every color that you've ever seen
[1:34:28] how many have ever went to home depot
[1:34:29] and they got colors for everything they
[1:34:31] got this wall
[1:34:32] plaster they come from seven colors of
[1:34:34] the rainbow
[1:34:35] and you can only see you and i can only
[1:34:38] see the seven colors
[1:34:39] of the rainbow we can't see radio waves
[1:34:41] we can't see microwave
[1:34:42] we can't see infrared we can't see
[1:34:44] ultraviolet we can't see x-ray and we
[1:34:46] can't see
[1:34:47] gamma rays but you know what there is a
[1:34:50] device and i'm not going to go through
[1:34:51] it there's a device for each one of them
[1:34:52] where you can see them
[1:34:54] right you can see the the manifestation
[1:34:57] of them
[1:34:58] all right the same way with god but
[1:34:59] watch this listen to this i'll tell you
[1:35:01] how fast this is then we'll close
[1:35:03] radio waves have the longest wavelength
[1:35:05] in the ultra
[1:35:07] electromagnetic spectrum according to
[1:35:09] nasa ranging from
[1:35:12] 0.04 inches
[1:35:17] to more than 62 miles they also have the
[1:35:21] lowest frequency
[1:35:24] listen to this radio waves the slowest
[1:35:28] frequency of radio waves travels 3 000
[1:35:32] cycles per second when you say 1001
[1:35:35] it's already circled a three it's
[1:35:37] already done three thousand cycles
[1:35:40] when you say one thousand 1001 that's
[1:35:41] how fast it is but
[1:35:44] they have the high spectrum
[1:35:47] which is 300
[1:35:51] billion hertz
[1:35:54] or 300 gigahertz which means
[1:35:57] it cycles 300 billion
[1:36:00] times in one second that's how fast that
[1:36:04] radio wave is that's why it can go
[1:36:06] through
[1:36:06] and they go listen they go through and
[1:36:08] they tell you that you know you don't
[1:36:09] need much for here for surface
[1:36:13] right you don't need much because
[1:36:14] there's nothing that you have to go
[1:36:15] through then little walkie-talkies you
[1:36:17] get
[1:36:18] but now what about if you want to talk
[1:36:19] to a submarine
[1:36:21] what about if you want to talk to miners
[1:36:23] that are 20 20 miles into the ground
[1:36:25] they can talk to them
[1:36:26] they just change the speed
[1:36:31] of the radio wave and it penetrates
[1:36:34] further down
[1:36:35] now this is limited man
[1:36:39] what do you think god speaks to you with
[1:36:43] because you know what sometimes mine in
[1:36:46] your head
[1:36:50] is a lot harder than anything man's had
[1:36:51] to penetrate had to penetrate
[1:36:55] on this earth doesn't matter how many
[1:36:57] miles down
[1:36:58] or how many miles up you know they can
[1:37:01] communicate with satellites now that are
[1:37:02] on the moon and one at mars they got
[1:37:04] pictures guess what
[1:37:06] that cycle is over 300
[1:37:09] billion cycles per second to get that
[1:37:12] picture
[1:37:13] who knows how many miles it is from here
[1:37:15] to mars it's further from here to
[1:37:17] california
[1:37:18] promise you that but those ready those
[1:37:20] things are coming
[1:37:23] and we're picking up pictures of another
[1:37:26] world
[1:37:28] listen by spiritual eyesight though
[1:37:32] see that's limited what man has done
[1:37:34] let's stand
[1:37:35] come come on musician by limited
[1:37:39] man we seem like we're almost unlimited
[1:37:43] but we haven't picked listen
[1:37:46] when them when a man passes away
[1:37:50] the bible says it doesn't matter if he's
[1:37:52] in the depths of the sea
[1:37:54] you know what the bible says that soul
[1:37:57] is going to go into some dimension
[1:37:59] it doesn't matter if you're ten thousand
[1:38:01] miles down in the earth and you die
[1:38:04] they're not gonna have to dig a hole to
[1:38:05] get you out sure your cuckoo bird is
[1:38:08] gonna stay there but your soul is gonna
[1:38:09] go right into another dimension a faster
[1:38:11] dimension a faster
[1:38:12] wave that's way past the 300 billion
[1:38:15] because 300 billion
[1:38:17] you can go right through that wall and
[1:38:18] not even it not even bother anything
[1:38:21] even at 3 000 cycles per second we're
[1:38:24] hearing radio i mean you put a little
[1:38:25] radio right here and you can pick up
[1:38:26] radio waves right here
[1:38:28] at 3 000 which is going through that
[1:38:29] wall at super
[1:38:31] super sonic speed
[1:38:35] and listen folks your new birth
[1:38:41] put you in another dimension in your
[1:38:43] soul
[1:38:44] your body's stuck in this but your soul
[1:38:47] is sitting in heavenly places
[1:38:50] your soul is communion with a god that
[1:38:52] can travel he doesn't need
[1:38:54] dimension one two three four five six
[1:38:56] seven sure we know he lives in seven
[1:38:58] right now
[1:38:59] but he can still come down here and
[1:39:01] visit you
[1:39:03] he can still come down here and talk to
[1:39:05] you by the baptism of the holy ghost he
[1:39:06] can come right there in your room
[1:39:08] and like i said before go through the
[1:39:10] thickest thing that ever was made on the
[1:39:12] face of the earth and that's your skull
[1:39:14] to get to your brain to tell you that he
[1:39:17] loves you
[1:39:18] to tell you that this plan of redemption
[1:39:22] is eternal so how do you exhaust
[1:39:25] anything that's eternal we're going to
[1:39:27] be talking about this plan
[1:39:29] if you know we got bible sure that bible
[1:39:32] but you know you can read that bible in
[1:39:33] probably
[1:39:34] a good day you could probably read it if
[1:39:36] you read fast enough but you didn't get
[1:39:37] won't get much out of it but what about
[1:39:40] living this thing though
[1:39:42] what about making each character come
[1:39:44] alive and each witness and each time
[1:39:46] somebody gets born again by one
[1:39:47] scripture
[1:39:48] then it opens up a whole another world
[1:39:51] how many worlds is the soul worth
[1:39:54] ten thousand worlds unlimited
[1:39:57] ten thousand worlds we think this earth
[1:40:00] is great
[1:40:01] your soul is worth more than ten
[1:40:03] thousand
[1:40:04] worlds but you know what god didn't
[1:40:07] leave us in this dimension folks
[1:40:10] he made a way for us to either get out
[1:40:13] of here by death or get out of here by
[1:40:14] the chains of the body
[1:40:15] we are going to go into another
[1:40:17] dimension and by the baptism of the holy
[1:40:20] ghost you're already in that dimension
[1:40:21] what we got to do is just let it start
[1:40:23] working on this thing
[1:40:25] he's still working on me right amen
[1:40:27] let's sing a song god bless you
[1:40:29] but that fourth dimension is right here
[1:40:32] god uses it but satan uses it too
[1:40:34] children listen we're influenced by the
[1:40:37] fourth dimension either good or bad
[1:40:39] because it's bombarding us whether we
[1:40:42] know it or not it's right there beating
[1:40:43] us
[1:40:44] and because you know what you're a
[1:40:45] spiritual being right
[1:40:48] you're human but you got a spiritual
[1:40:50] spirituality
[1:40:51] a part of you that is faster than the
[1:40:54] speed of light
[1:40:56] your soul but when you get born again
[1:40:59] god thank god he seals that in but see
[1:41:01] still that spirit world though
[1:41:03] that spirit world twirls around that
[1:41:05] brother chris and satan can jump right
[1:41:07] in there by that fourth dimension and he
[1:41:09] can try to influence me and you
[1:41:11] but you know what god said
[1:41:15] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:41:19] you don't have to chant you don't have
[1:41:20] to even call the pastor for that one
[1:41:22] it's good to call and get pastor to pray
[1:41:24] for you don't get me wrong
[1:41:25] but if the devil's beating on you
[1:41:29] just resist him start singing boy
[1:41:32] that'll do it
[1:41:33] start singing a good gospel song i don't
[1:41:35] do it i'll guarantee you that'll
[1:41:36] that'll make him that'll make him want
[1:41:38] to leave so let's sing a song god bless
[1:41:39] you
[1:41:39] brother remember today's the anniversary
[1:41:42] of the cloud
[1:41:43] oh is it today's the anniversary of the
[1:41:45] cloud appearing
[1:41:46] that's right it is february 28th that's
[1:41:48] right so anyway so i didn't know that
[1:41:50] but thank you god bless you
[1:41:52] that cloud was real that cloud was given
[1:41:55] to us for a sign
[1:41:57] that cloud was not it was not william
[1:41:59] branham it's that man right there jesus
[1:42:00] christ
[1:42:02] william branham just happened to be the
[1:42:03] what he was the radio
[1:42:06] he was the receptor though but what did
[1:42:08] he do he slowed it down
[1:42:10] boy i just got that he slowed it down
[1:42:14] even he spoke slow his slow kentucky
[1:42:18] english
[1:42:19] but you know what that was god speaking
[1:42:20] to me and you he came from that other
[1:42:22] dimension and gave it to the prophet and
[1:42:24] the prophet broke it down and gave it to
[1:42:25] me and you
[1:42:26] right here in this dimension listen we
[1:42:28] needed it had to have it you can't get
[1:42:31] it any other way
[1:42:33] you cannot leave this earth without
[1:42:34] having this message in you
[1:42:36] and it be alive okay
[1:42:41] i'm sorry you just can't
[1:42:44] it is february 28th yes it is february
[1:42:47] you're right it's february 28th you're
[1:42:48] right man
[1:42:48] you're right if i didn't know that was
[1:42:50] the day that i thought it was in march
[1:42:51] but march is when he
[1:42:53] went out to the went out to arizona and
[1:42:55] yeah
[1:42:56] i could be wrong no i think you're right
[1:42:58] anyway
[1:43:00] february 28th okay bro chris knows
[1:43:04] see he don't have no hair to we have
[1:43:06] hair and it kind of bounces off we don't
[1:43:07] get much revelation but then ball-headed
[1:43:09] when they get pretty good in revelation
[1:43:13] god bless you let's thank us amen this
[1:43:14] thing all fly away i'll fly away
[1:43:17] oh some glad morning
[1:43:21] when this life is over
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:33] it's already there we just gotta get to
[1:43:37] it
[1:43:38] john sawyer coming down now to heaven
[1:43:41] and came down to this dimension
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:04] now
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:17] has flown
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:32] way

[1:45:28] stop
[1:45:31] thank you every time
[1:45:36] you listen to me every time
[1:45:40] the song leader says let's let them play
[1:45:43] one
[1:45:44] they're playing their heart out when
[1:45:46] you're singing
[1:45:48] and then they go right
[1:45:51] you can't hardly hear them i want to
[1:45:53] hear every one of you just like we're
[1:45:55] not singing
[1:45:56] i mean like we are singing you got it
[1:45:57] amen do it for the glory of the lord
[1:46:00] if you ain't got a set of lungs use your
[1:46:02] hands for your lungs
[1:46:04] all right so we're going to sing i'll
[1:46:05] fly away and then they're going to play
[1:46:08] one verse you ready i want to hear it or
[1:46:11] we going to do it again
[1:46:12] football coach said do it again didn't
[1:46:15] do it right that time
[1:46:17] i'm not talking just to you it's okay oh
[1:46:20] i'm going to fly away oh glory

[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:16] i'll be raptured
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:24] remember we're eagles
[1:47:27] we're not earthbound birds this age
[1:47:31] we're supposed to not stand and look up
[1:47:33] and
[1:47:34] you know how brother branham would stand
[1:47:35] and he'd look up he said i always wanted
[1:47:37] to go places i'd see them airplanes
[1:47:40] go across well right there where me and
[1:47:43] terrence and
[1:47:44] daddy live is the flight pattern from
[1:47:46] the north part of hartsville
[1:47:48] when it was going very well you every
[1:47:50] minute there'd be a plane
[1:47:52] in three three sections here they come
[1:47:56] and you know what there was people up
[1:47:58] there in them and there was 30 000 feet
[1:48:00] between me and those people
[1:48:03] but they ain't 30 000 feet between you
[1:48:05] and god
[1:48:07] you ain't got to get up there you
[1:48:10] already got the vehicle
[1:48:12] inside your soul to bring that god
[1:48:15] glory to here
[1:48:19] every day god's not over the sea
[1:48:23] he's not away from you anywhere but you
[1:48:26] and i
[1:48:27] must realize we're heading toward the
[1:48:29] end of this thing
[1:48:32] and it's okay we can learn you know it's
[1:48:33] nice to learn the dimensions and all but
[1:48:35] use them
[1:48:37] use them for the glory of the lord call
[1:48:38] out to god
[1:48:40] study read your bible pray pray you
[1:48:43] don't have to plug in anything just pray
[1:48:46] pray without ceasing go down the road i
[1:48:48] know brother ryan does he sits there
[1:48:49] with chickens all dead chickens are live
[1:48:51] chickens all day long
[1:48:53] how did eagle get caught with chicken
[1:49:00] exactly but anyway i mean but you do
[1:49:03] study though right i mean you get
[1:49:04] i love brother ryan he gets his study
[1:49:06] time in sitting in the truck how many of
[1:49:07] y'all study just kind of sitting
[1:49:09] don't do it at a red light but but you
[1:49:12] pray without ceasing you've got
[1:49:14] you listen you don't need an instrument
[1:49:18] to contact god with i wish it was that
[1:49:20] easy by the way
[1:49:21] brother ray we go now for 49.95 and two
[1:49:24] ginsu knives
[1:49:25] you you can you can have this device
[1:49:29] that'll help you talk to god well
[1:49:31] everybody buy one
[1:49:33] and get the two knives but you don't
[1:49:35] have to have that
[1:49:37] all you got to have is what a soul sorry
[1:49:39] amen
[1:49:40] all you gotta have is a soul that's what
[1:49:42] god wants to contact he wants to contact
[1:49:44] your soul
[1:49:45] glory remember what brother brown said
[1:49:47] if i can ever get that soul
[1:49:49] what still long enough
[1:49:52] what realize you're lost realize now
[1:49:55] that you're born again
[1:49:56] realize that you're going up the statue
[1:49:58] of a perfect man realize that we need
[1:50:00] god more than anything else we need in
[1:50:01] this world
[1:50:03] and that prayer is cheap doesn't cost a
[1:50:06] dime
