[19:19] and i believe if you've got the right
[19:21] revelation you can look around and see
[19:23] him
[19:24] right next to you in the pew amen
[19:28] while you're standing i'd like you to
[19:29] take your bibles and let's turn to saint
[19:31] matthew 22 god bless you all
[19:33] uh thank you for the short break we'll
[19:36] get back with it and i'll see if the
[19:37] lord won't permit me to be able to
[19:39] uh bring this to some closure
[19:43] brothers and sisters you know i i think
[19:45] we realize by now at least i do that
[19:47] god's word is eternal
[19:50] and really there's no end you see we
[19:53] could be preaching these things
[19:54] back and forth and up and down in
[19:56] different dimensions and
[19:58] and all kinds of uh uh patterns
[20:02] and as long as it's god doing the
[20:03] inspiration
[20:05] and god behind it there'll be no end to
[20:06] it so the revelation is
[20:09] endless it's so compound
[20:13] and so we want to be able to uh allow
[20:16] ourselves to just settle down
[20:19] ask the lord to open himself up to us
[20:21] amen
[20:22] through the way of his word so if you've
[20:25] got matthew 22 we'll
[20:27] we'll get right down through a few of
[20:28] the verses and get you seated
[20:31] it says like this uh in verse 1 jesus
[20:33] answered and spake unto them
[20:35] again by parables and said the kingdom
[20:38] of heaven is like unto a certain king
[20:40] which made a marriage for his son sent
[20:43] forth his servants to call them that
[20:46] were bidden to the wedding
[20:49] and they would not come let's pray
[20:51] father
[20:52] lord i truly believe with all my heart
[20:54] lord had these folks known
[20:57] the end result father of them not coming
[21:00] they would not have chosen that way lord
[21:02] they would have wanted to come
[21:04] they would have been encouraging each
[21:06] other to come lord but
[21:07] in fact the bible says they did not come
[21:10] so father there is a mandate
[21:14] and there has a proclamation has went
[21:16] out lord that
[21:18] that the the place will be full
[21:21] and lord there will be people there who
[21:24] want to be their lord
[21:26] i pray that you'd make that father the
[21:28] the zeal of our heart this evening and
[21:30] help us lord
[21:32] to settle ourselves down now and allow
[21:35] your word to speak to us father
[21:38] we love you and thank you in jesus name
[21:41] amen
[21:42] god bless you may be seated i'm just
[21:45] going to take off from this morning if
[21:46] that's okay without any laps
[21:51] verse 4. now we saw over in luke 14 that
[21:54] a servant was sent
[21:56] very little was said about the servant
[21:59] except that he
[22:00] was given a a responsibility and a job
[22:03] to do and he went out to do it
[22:04] and he was rejected flatly rejected
[22:08] at the end of his ministry we find out
[22:11] that there were some that
[22:12] showed up
[22:14] [Laughter]
[22:16] just very few compared
[22:19] to the amount of invitations that were
[22:21] sent out so here we see now over here in
[22:24] matthew 22
[22:25] parable of the marriage feast not just
[22:27] the great supper that now it's a certain
[22:28] king
[22:29] not a certain man i wrote this down
[22:31] while i was considering things that the
[22:33] prophet said
[22:34] a certain man and you'll catch this
[22:36] after i get going
[22:37] would represent his first coming and a
[22:40] certain king would represent his second
[22:42] coming
[22:43] and many of the things that brother
[22:44] branham had taught us
[22:46] were concerning the the the first coming
[22:50] compounding over to the second coming it
[22:52] would be like jesus in luke four
[22:55] when he took the book and he went into
[22:56] the synagogue as as was his custom and
[22:59] and and took the book and he he read out
[23:01] of the book of isaiah right
[23:03] and uh but he only he only read one and
[23:05] a half scriptures and then he stopped
[23:08] all right now we realize that he's the
[23:11] god of his word
[23:12] and his word does not stop why did jesus
[23:15] stop in the middle
[23:16] of that scripture is because the second
[23:19] half of that scripture pertained to his
[23:21] second
[23:22] coming and and and if you'll read on in
[23:25] isaiah you'll find out over there
[23:27] in the rest of those verses and in the
[23:28] next chapter that the reason that he
[23:30] didn't read the second half is because
[23:32] it did pertain to judgment
[23:36] know you not that the saints will judge
[23:39] how are we going to do it we're not
[23:42] going to do it by sitting in
[23:43] a in a courtroom i want you to
[23:46] understand this
[23:47] uh and and declaring what is right or
[23:49] wrong
[23:50] what is righteous and unrighteous and so
[23:52] forth what is good and bad
[23:54] the way that the second half of that
[23:57] scripture is going to be fulfilled in
[23:59] isaiah
[24:00] is by a body
[24:03] but it's a many member body and that
[24:06] body is the mystical body of christ that
[24:08] we call the church
[24:09] and or the bride of christ and believe
[24:12] me brothers and sisters
[24:13] your life right now if you're a believer
[24:16] is judging everyone around you
[24:19] everyone in your family anybody you
[24:21] become acquainted with
[24:22] who becomes acquainted with you know ye
[24:25] not that the saints
[24:27] will judge you see god reserve
[24:30] that for his second coming
[24:33] and i believe his second coming is here
[24:36] right now
[24:37] it's just that the last member of that
[24:39] body apparently has not come in
[24:41] or he is here do you believe he's here
[24:46] well then for you who believe he's here
[24:48] he's not coming he's here
[24:50] but it's a coming is a movement an
[24:53] action
[24:53] something that that constantly is out
[24:56] reaching out and looking for something
[24:59] that last one that last one comes in
[25:04] he'll take the book we are told
[25:07] and redemption is then over
[25:11] right but that's his second coming
[25:14] that i'm saying that for a purpose
[25:17] because over to me
[25:18] in luke 14 it represented his
[25:22] first and his second coming except there
[25:25] was a pause you're with me
[25:29] i'm going to read to you how that pause
[25:31] happened out of blasphemous
[25:33] blasphemous names is the right way to
[25:35] pronounce it but
[25:37] you got to forgive me i might not always
[25:40] say it just right
[25:42] the brothers know that i want to start
[25:44] at page 41.
[25:45] there's no paragraphs in this old
[25:48] publication that i have
[25:50] but uh now one more thing brother
[25:52] branham is going to say
[25:53] that's that's these are his words now
[25:55] one more thing he's just preached
[25:57] blasphemous names which really if you
[26:00] get the gist of this message along with
[26:02] stature of the perfect man
[26:04] was about how you received and how you
[26:08] were sealed with the holy ghost
[26:10] did you realize that they tie together
[26:13] perfectly
[26:14] at the first of this message he talks
[26:15] about the baptism of the holy ghost
[26:18] and it's not correctly taught he says
[26:20] and the reason it wasn't correctly
[26:22] taught in his day and
[26:24] much of the day we live in is because
[26:26] what people don't realize there's a lot
[26:28] that goes with it
[26:29] they don't realize there's so much that
[26:30] goes with it they'll say baptism the
[26:32] holy ghost i've reached the summit i'm
[26:34] all done
[26:35] no the prophet said you're just getting
[26:37] started why
[26:38] because the baptism of the holy ghost
[26:41] has
[26:41] lots of intricate working parts with it
[26:45] he says like the automobile points plugs
[26:48] coils it's got suspension it's got
[26:50] exhaust
[26:51] it's got fuel delivery it's got spark
[26:53] it's got
[26:54] you can go down the list it's got a body
[26:57] it's even got wheels within wheels
[27:02] you see so it's so we all want to
[27:05] simplify it
[27:07] and when i say simplify it i don't mean
[27:09] it's difficult
[27:10] i mean you have to go through the
[27:11] process
[27:13] what we want to do is we want to pull up
[27:15] short i appreciate the specials that
[27:18] were sung especially the one that said
[27:20] he don't stop he don't stop
[27:24] you see i read to you earlier today out
[27:26] of out of uh
[27:27] uh is this the sign of the end sir up a
[27:29] hill down a hill up a hill downhill and
[27:31] he
[27:32] and he disappeared well he disappeared
[27:35] but god don't stop
[27:38] that's the whole gist of what i'm trying
[27:40] to convey to you is that
[27:42] god don't stop the message don't stop
[27:45] revelation don't stop somebody asked me
[27:48] what we were going to do when we got to
[27:49] heaven i said well the first thing i'm
[27:51] going to do is rest and walk around and
[27:52] visit with folks and that might take 10
[27:54] 000 or 15 or 20.
[27:56] i don't know how many thousands of years
[27:57] it's going to take it really doesn't
[27:58] matter to me
[28:00] yeah but then what are you going to do
[28:02] well revelation isn't going to stop god
[28:03] don't stop
[28:06] it's hard for us to imagine how that
[28:09] could be
[28:10] because we're creatures that began at
[28:12] least in this form
[28:13] and we can see that we might have an end
[28:18] but the true believer don't stop
[28:21] all right so out of blasphemous names
[28:25] he says it like this bear with me
[28:28] now one more thing will you permit me to
[28:30] for it to be said
[28:32] day before yesterday morning you'll
[28:34] notice on the board out there a vision
[28:36] i like the fact that brother branham was
[28:38] so bold and so confident
[28:40] that when he had a vision put it on the
[28:42] bulletin board
[28:43] now maybe that vision hadn't come to
[28:45] pass yet but he still put it on the
[28:47] bulletin board
[28:48] right i had a vision it was about five
[28:51] in the morning
[28:51] five o'clock as my wife back there knows
[28:54] or six i'd woke up
[28:55] we got up to get the children ready to
[28:57] go to school i want you to notice this
[28:59] this is god's prophet he's going to go
[29:01] into a vision
[29:02] but he ain't you know on top of the
[29:04] mountain with his legs crossed in a yoga
[29:09] he's just doing his daily chores
[29:12] he's helping his wife get the kids ready
[29:14] for school
[29:16] and the spirit of the lord comes down i
[29:19] just have these
[29:20] now and then you all know every one of
[29:22] you here they never fail
[29:25] i believe that they never failed because
[29:28] they were god
[29:29] they weren't the man he didn't give
[29:30] himself the vision now
[29:34] they're absolutely perfect they never
[29:36] fail and i thought i was the happiest
[29:37] person
[29:39] i ever seen
[29:42] why because he was standing in the sun
[29:44] s-u-n
[29:45] and was preaching the gospel to a large
[29:47] mammoth congregation
[29:50] i just wanted to see if it was being
[29:52] taped he said a large mammoth
[29:53] congregation
[29:54] and they were sitting in a setting in a
[29:56] forest
[29:57] and streaks of the sun was shining down
[29:59] on them
[30:02] but just here and there
[30:05] are getting it getting the word amen
[30:08] and i'm as usual always too long
[30:13] too late preached too long and i
[30:15] preached so long
[30:17] until the congregation become hungry for
[30:19] physical food and they
[30:22] some of them got tired so they just got
[30:24] up and went out to get them some food
[30:26] started going out and i said don't don't
[30:30] do you remember something like that over
[30:32] in is this the sign of the end time sir
[30:35] huh you look on this and people just got
[30:39] weary or whatever happened to him and
[30:40] they started wandering off
[30:43] but here he says don't don't
[30:46] i had two climaxes i wanted to meet i
[30:49] wanted to meet
[30:50] in my sermon now don't you find it
[30:52] interesting brethren that he didn't say
[30:53] three
[30:56] and the lord had given to me and any
[30:57] preacher knows when you really know it's
[30:59] god give it to you you just burn and to
[31:00] tell the people
[31:02] and i was just a preaching just
[31:05] uh uh just to preaching charlie just as
[31:07] hard as i could preach
[31:09] just laying it on you know and saying
[31:11] all these great things
[31:13] and that was this what god's doing look
[31:15] at this he discerns the thoughts of the
[31:17] heart what is it the word and going on
[31:19] like that
[31:21] and oh i wish i could remember it now
[31:23] this blows me away
[31:24] oh i remember i wish i could remember
[31:26] what i was saying
[31:27] what my text was are you kidding me he
[31:30] got a vision from the lord
[31:32] and he seen himself preaching but he
[31:34] didn't know what he was preaching
[31:37] amen it was the lord preaching through
[31:39] him but when he would try to remember
[31:41] what was said he couldn't
[31:42] remember it he couldn't bring him back
[31:44] up i'm going to tell you why
[31:47] it wasn't him preaching it was the lord
[31:50] preaching through him
[31:54] there's that's going to make a point
[31:55] here one of these days all right
[31:58] now i'm not demeaning a prophet so don't
[32:00] you get offended
[32:02] i'm being realistic about what i'm
[32:04] reading
[32:07] he was preaching the house down and he
[32:08] couldn't remember
[32:10] what he was saying most preachers don't
[32:13] hesitate to give you the whole message
[32:16] you know what i mean you should have
[32:18] heard me
[32:20] what was my what my text was i can't
[32:22] think of it see but i was just preaching
[32:24] away
[32:25] and i was watching myself do it and then
[32:27] when i was that's interesting
[32:31] when i was standing there looking he was
[32:33] watching himself do it
[32:34] well i thought he was doing it
[32:38] in a way he was and in a way he wasn't
[32:42] right when i was standing there looking
[32:44] and watching myself preach it
[32:46] and i was just a preaching to who
[32:48] wouldn't have it isn't that an
[32:50] interesting saying that must be from the
[32:51] south
[32:52] why in the world would you preach to
[32:54] somebody who wouldn't
[32:56] have it yeah right
[33:02] okay apparently they wouldn't have it
[33:05] because we're going to find out they got
[33:07] up and left
[33:09] can you imagine after a bit i raised up
[33:12] you know and i thought glory to god i
[33:14] said look at these wonderful things and
[33:16] this and that
[33:17] directly i noticed the people begin to
[33:19] get like they was physically hungry
[33:23] you know what happens when you don't get
[33:25] spiritually filled
[33:27] you get physically hungry so how
[33:30] they had enough spiritual so they
[33:32] started
[33:33] let's read that again are you with me
[33:37] they had enough spiritual i can't get
[33:41] enough
[33:44] so they started walking away and some of
[33:46] them brother branham yawns
[33:50] to illustrate started walking away and i
[33:52] thought what's the matter with everybody
[33:55] brothers and sisters there in a day goes
[33:59] by when i don't think that
[34:01] what is the matter with everybody and i
[34:04] looked here and saw some young couples
[34:06] praise the lord
[34:08] going along to my side and i stopped and
[34:11] i said just a minute friends
[34:13] just a minute you'll be back again
[34:16] when the evening shadows fall
[34:20] is that what it says can i can i point
[34:22] out to you that the word
[34:24] shadows is plural
[34:28] in luke 14 it was a shadow
[34:32] servant but in matthew 22
[34:36] we have plural we have servants
[34:39] servants cast shadows a servant
[34:42] only cast a
[34:47] now shadow not taking away from the
[34:48] prophet now
[34:51] but something's happening you see
[34:54] he decreased so something could increase
[34:58] he left the scene why because
[35:01] the people that were surrounding him
[35:04] were seeing more light than they could
[35:06] manage
[35:07] and it was beginning to blind them
[35:10] far be it from god to allow
[35:13] his work to blind his own people
[35:18] yet israel was blinded for our sex
[35:24] why israel decided
[35:28] that they would take on other gods you
[35:30] see how it works
[35:32] it looks like it all falls on god and
[35:35] he's the one who'd done it no
[35:36] they were blinded by god because they
[35:40] elected other gods
[35:43] that's what happens in this age
[35:47] blind laodicea is blind because she
[35:51] chooses
[35:52] other ways than the ways of the lord
[35:56] now his ways are mysterious
[35:59] his ways are beyond understanding and
[36:02] comprehension by the human mind
[36:05] but they're his ways nonetheless you
[36:08] still with me
[36:10] i said you'll be back again
[36:15] i want you to notice he didn't say i'll
[36:17] be back again you'll be back again but
[36:19] let me give you this first climax
[36:23] first pull second pull third pull that's
[36:25] the first climax that's the second
[36:26] climax it's the third climax
[36:29] where does all these things come from
[36:30] that i've showed you where are they from
[36:32] i said
[36:32] here they are they're in the word of god
[36:34] and they are thus said the lord
[36:36] his promise because i said all of you
[36:38] bear me record witness this that my
[36:40] commission is
[36:41] stay with the word i said what's the
[36:44] matter with all of you
[36:45] can't you understand the word you must
[36:48] understand it
[36:49] now that goes right along with your
[36:50] t-shirt brother samuel
[36:53] but as i read these things i see
[36:56] something in here maybe you don't see it
[36:58] and if i'm wrong
[37:00] i'll accept it but what i see is the
[37:03] prophet again
[37:04] trying to explain
[37:07] the first climax what about this what
[37:10] about this and what about that what that
[37:13] and the people are like
[37:16] i'm hungry
[37:19] uh-huh and someone said man i'd like to
[37:22] have some biscuits
[37:24] and some like that
[37:28] i want you to understand now that this
[37:30] is a vision
[37:32] you know this these things are symbolic
[37:36] and they're also real glory
[37:39] people want biscuits i'm going to tell
[37:41] you right now
[37:42] i want prime rib i want baked potato
[37:45] with the works
[37:47] oh i'll take a biscuit but that's not
[37:49] what i'm hungry for
[37:52] huh man shall not live
[37:55] buy biscuits alone
[37:59] bread alone right
[38:02] but look at this look at the condition
[38:05] look at the condition of the people
[38:08] he said well i just thought well glory
[38:09] to god if they want biscuits
[38:12] let them go get them right so i turned
[38:15] around and i thought oh but you know
[38:16] what the shadows
[38:18] plural is going to fall after a while
[38:22] right away and i said then tonight when
[38:25] that congregation gathers in again now i
[38:27] put the climax to them
[38:29] told them that the things that they have
[38:30] seen me do is found in the word of god
[38:33] not in some mythical book or some
[38:35] organization
[38:36] it's found in the word okay
[38:40] every bit of it in the word because i'm
[38:42] commissioned to that
[38:44] and i thought you know they'll everyone
[38:46] be back tonight
[38:47] so here's what i'll do i'll background
[38:52] that's what jesus done on the road to
[38:53] emmaus by the way
[38:56] kind of background you know the way i do
[38:59] it on these church ages and things and
[39:01] say what i said before
[39:02] i'll background it on the word and then
[39:05] this great
[39:06] marvelous climax i said what a time
[39:09] it'll be
[39:10] praise be to god now he saw something
[39:14] he saw something in this
[39:17] and i seen myself watch now watch how
[39:20] this fits in with
[39:21] over here up a hill down a hill up a
[39:23] hill down a hill
[39:25] getting smaller and smaller and smaller
[39:29] wait a minute it'll be praise be to god
[39:32] and i've seen myself getting real
[39:34] little you know why
[39:38] because god won't give his glory to
[39:40] another
[39:42] there ain't no one man taking god's
[39:44] glory
[39:47] but one man can be the glory of god
[39:52] but he ain't taking god's glory and
[39:56] heard that
[39:56] praise be to god and i seen myself
[39:58] fading
[40:00] up not out
[40:04] fading up like that and here i was
[40:08] standing there now here's the
[40:11] interpretation thereof
[40:13] see the first thing that i have done the
[40:15] things that's been done has been
[40:17] mystical to the people most of them
[40:20] i don't mean the full gospel and saints
[40:23] of god
[40:24] but i mean to most of the people
[40:27] does that not sound like saint luke 14
[40:33] that servant went out and they
[40:36] just couldn't accept him
[40:40] okay and you never want to look at the
[40:43] world
[40:43] cosmos as the message of god
[40:47] when you go in you say like jose i'm
[40:49] reading this for a purpose
[40:52] matson bose of course it's boze i've
[40:55] always
[40:56] said i had a dream years ago that the
[40:58] the god would send me to chicago and
[41:00] shake chicago for the glory of god
[41:02] i said joseph watch it now he's
[41:06] already done it
[41:10] he's already sent his servant
[41:15] listen to how it ended up why he said
[41:18] they haven't been shaken since
[41:20] moody this is jose and brother brown
[41:21] says that i'm talking about the church
[41:24] listen to what he says that's cannon
[41:27] fodder out there
[41:28] oh again you see god sent his servant
[41:35] and they rejected him
[41:38] and they could not come in
[41:43] cannon fodder he called them okay
[41:47] that's just dust of the earth that bunch
[41:50] cramming through the streets painted
[41:52] jezebels and everything i said
[41:54] that's out there then big old lodges and
[41:56] things will crumble
[41:57] fall into the streets and there i said
[41:58] he's talking about the church
[42:01] the church has seen the revelation of
[42:03] jesus christ
[42:04] made manifest and they recognize it
[42:08] they may not be 15 out of chicago man
[42:11] that was a big
[42:12] city it's still a big city 15.
[42:17] remember go into the highways and the
[42:19] hedges
[42:22] compel them there may be 10 in this
[42:24] congregation out of the whole
[42:26] city of chicago come forth
[42:31] did you ever think of that as it was in
[42:35] the days of noah so will it be in the
[42:37] at the coming of the son of man wherein
[42:38] eight souls were saved
[42:40] how many come out of sodom see what see
[42:43] what i mean
[42:44] i doubt being a handful see
[42:50] but the church itself has received the
[42:52] shaking
[42:53] they've recognized it they knowed the
[42:55] word they seen the word when it was
[42:57] being materialized
[42:58] and they caught it now look at that for
[43:01] a minute
[43:02] well let's take a minute amen remember
[43:05] something brothers and sisters that the
[43:07] church
[43:08] and the bride are only one
[43:11] and the same when the bride is in it
[43:16] what we find out over in revelations
[43:19] what 17 or 18
[43:21] that the church itself then has a
[43:24] shaking
[43:24] you see chicago was shook here
[43:27] and those that did not accept the
[43:29] invitation were cannon fodder
[43:32] and then there was more calls and more
[43:34] pools and more
[43:35] preaching made more manifestations more
[43:39] signs wonders and miracles and a handful
[43:42] almost got it
[43:47] he said that's the church it'll be a
[43:50] small group he's
[43:51] he would always say fear not little
[43:53] flock
[43:55] see but now watch what's going to happen
[43:59] that was under the servant yes at the
[44:02] end of luke 14
[44:03] there were people that finally
[44:07] decided through the for the through the
[44:10] much labor of that servant
[44:14] to come to the great supper
[44:19] what they didn't realize is they hadn't
[44:21] arrived yet
[44:24] because it's not just the great supper
[44:26] to them that's what it looks like and
[44:27] that's what it was called
[44:29] and that's what they came for but
[44:32] then they heard a cry saying come out of
[44:35] her
[44:36] my people be not partakers
[44:41] you see so we're not finished yet
[44:44] right that was just the church
[44:47] the bride has to come through
[44:50] the church but she don't stay
[44:53] in the church she becomes
[44:56] an invincible army she becomes
[45:00] him she becomes the word
[45:03] made manifest she becomes
[45:06] christ as he is in a mystical body
[45:11] that's a handful and we can say it
[45:14] yes sir i can preach it i believe
[45:18] it but when is it going to manifest
[45:22] well i'd say that's in god's time
[45:25] because i'm ready
[45:27] you ready then we need to pray for the
[45:30] last one or ones to come
[45:34] ready who makes her ready
[45:37] over in the book of revelations that
[45:39] says she
[45:40] has made herself ready
[45:44] you see but it was based on the message
[45:47] that the first servant brought what he
[45:50] was really bringing and they didn't want
[45:52] any part of at first
[45:54] was the garment they didn't want all the
[45:58] word
[46:00] they only wanted the part of the word
[46:02] that fit them
[46:03] so they began to make excuses of why
[46:05] they wasn't coming
[46:07] and they were lame duck excuses
[46:11] written up by a crack doctor
[46:16] i've bought some land i better go see
[46:19] what i bought
[46:20] right huh i bought some oxen i better
[46:23] see if they can even stand on their own
[46:25] four feet
[46:27] i bought a wife have no idea whether she
[46:29] can cook or clean or what she looks like
[46:32] or whether she loves me or not or what
[46:36] that's all you get he bought a wife had
[46:39] to go
[46:39] check it out that's brothers
[46:43] this is whether you realize it that's
[46:44] what the church was doing
[46:47] under the first call under what we would
[46:49] call the first coming now
[46:51] it wasn't the first coming of jesus
[46:53] christ but it was
[46:54] as i was talking to brother samuel and
[46:56] i'll be careful i agree with him that
[46:58] brother branham is not the
[47:00] chief but the ministry of jesus christ
[47:04] through brother branham was the chief
[47:06] wave offering
[47:07] stating that this is one member of the
[47:09] body of christ and this is what the body
[47:11] of christ is going to look like
[47:13] so every other member
[47:16] will do these works no we won't take the
[47:20] position of the prophet
[47:22] that's not what it's saying but we
[47:24] become members of the same body that
[47:26] performs the same
[47:28] actions now brothers and sisters you may
[47:31] not be
[47:32] one of the god hath placed
[47:35] some in the fivefold ministry but if you
[47:38] sit in a church where god hath
[47:41] placed one
[47:46] you're good that's right because the
[47:49] spirit that's on
[47:50] that office will permeate throughout
[47:54] that congregation and that congregation
[47:57] now becomes a part of
[47:59] that part of the body therefore
[48:02] you yourself listen careful and i'm not
[48:05] impugning or demeaning
[48:07] signs wonders and miracles i believe
[48:09] they can happen in each and every life
[48:11] i believe that you as a believer can
[48:13] perform any one of them
[48:15] at god's chosen time
[48:21] it has to it takes faith but even if
[48:24] you've never
[48:25] seen a sign wondering miracle and you're
[48:28] part of the body that performs them
[48:32] you're good you're right amen
[48:35] are you with me
[48:38] and you could be bad as we're going to
[48:41] find out
[48:42] and if you stay in this body the only
[48:46] thing that'll keep you from glory
[48:48] is how you're dressed
[48:51] in the word if you believe you don't
[48:54] have to
[48:54] understand all this word you just have
[48:56] to believe it
[48:57] now here's what happens in the world we
[48:59] live in
[49:00] as you believe as you receive
[49:04] you become the very word you don't
[49:07] understand
[49:09] come on can i ask you a serious question
[49:12] is anybody in the house understand
[49:14] themselves completely
[49:16] i know you don't because the prophet of
[49:18] god's wife said billy
[49:20] that people don't understand you and he
[49:22] said i don't understand myself
[49:25] but the revelation of jesus christ
[49:28] in your soul gives you the confidence
[49:32] that if you don't know
[49:33] it yet you will and
[49:36] if you never know it it's because god
[49:39] didn't show it to you and it won't
[49:41] matter in your walk
[49:45] you still with me all right let's keep
[49:48] going
[49:48] oh i'm going to get over to matthew 22
[49:50] and close on that one
[49:52] all right now where did i leave off now
[49:58] okay but the church itself has received
[50:00] the shaking they've recognized it they
[50:02] knowed the word
[50:03] they seen the word when it was being
[50:05] materialized excuse me
[50:07] and they caught it now look at that for
[50:09] a
[50:10] minute does that sound familiar
[50:15] paragraph 133 answers look
[50:18] on this now remember what he
[50:22] asked them to look on was not written
[50:25] on yet it was white stone
[50:30] it was inside the pyramid
[50:37] it's all right if i preach under
[50:38] inspiration
[50:44] oh where is that quote you know i'm
[50:47] it's something that's in us
[50:50] could it be something that's in us yeah
[50:54] remember brother brandon preaching on
[50:55] that now i'll have to think real hard
[50:57] i got it written in here but i'm not
[50:59] going to take the time to look through
[51:00] and find it
[51:03] oh recognizing your day and its message
[51:06] paragraph 72 the rapture is at hand
[51:10] is it something that's inside us
[51:14] that's part of this
[51:17] look at this white stone not
[51:21] written on yet because light hadn't
[51:23] shined on it
[51:24] because it wasn't time and the reason
[51:28] why that god hadn't let light shine on
[51:31] it and keep it on
[51:32] written is so that the enemy could not
[51:34] get a hold of it and begin to try to
[51:36] manipulate
[51:37] mimic interpret you understand what i'm
[51:41] saying
[51:42] an imposter the third pool will not have
[51:46] any mimics
[51:47] there will be no imposters there will be
[51:49] no impersonators
[51:50] exactly it will be the real
[51:54] deal okay
[51:57] and and and brother samuel and i were
[51:59] talking and at 100 percent
[52:01] the third pool is the opening of the
[52:04] word
[52:05] exactly i believe that with all my heart
[52:08] but
[52:08] the opening of the word brings
[52:10] repercussions
[52:13] you understand what i'm saying like for
[52:15] instance brother branham would say
[52:17] it's it's to the totally lost but it's
[52:19] for the bride
[52:21] okay i know i'm paraphrasing but i'm
[52:23] close
[52:24] you with me so the same word and i know
[52:28] i have that written down here somewhere
[52:30] i believe in questions and answers on
[52:31] the seals brother branham says the same
[52:34] gospel that's being preached to you
[52:36] tonight
[52:37] will condemn those who reject it
[52:41] the same do you see the same word it's
[52:44] not two different words
[52:46] it's not two different sentences they're
[52:48] not even they're not even worded
[52:50] differently
[52:51] they're worded exactly the same way
[52:54] but one of them cuts off and one of them
[52:56] cuts in
[52:59] right still with me all right
[53:03] i'm going to lose track of time but i'll
[53:06] go i'll speed along as fast as i can
[53:08] thank you
[53:11] it's like throwing the dog a bone
[53:14] all right let me find out where i was at
[53:17] again
[53:22] you see in my old uh book there's no
[53:26] paragraphs all right
[53:29] i had two climaxes i wanted to meet no
[53:31] the church itself has received the
[53:33] shaking
[53:34] now and this first message when they'd
[53:36] see it
[53:38] so they would see it when they'd see
[53:42] it everybody rallied for it and said oh
[53:45] glory to god oh if i could see this that
[53:47] and the other and they'd go right away
[53:49] the same way they came in
[53:55] the first message the first climax
[54:00] did you realize that you can hear the
[54:02] first message by putting a tape if you
[54:05] still
[54:05] have one in your tape player and turning
[54:08] it on
[54:11] i want you to get this everybody rallied
[54:14] for it
[54:16] oh glory to god oh i could see this that
[54:18] and the other yeah a lot of different
[54:20] viewpoints and revelations came into
[54:23] play
[54:24] whenever there was not the prophet there
[54:26] to say wait a minute
[54:28] or whole or that's good that's right
[54:31] that's wrong
[54:33] see and they'd go right away the
[54:38] same way they came in
[54:41] see and now they think and now they
[54:44] think well
[54:45] i don't know listen look at the stages
[54:50] look at the pools now when you think of
[54:52] a pool you're thinking of
[54:54] first one is healing the second one is
[54:55] discernment of
[54:57] but but remember brothers and sisters
[54:59] these servants
[55:00] in matthew 22 also have three pulls
[55:06] they're not different than the poles
[55:08] that god has always used
[55:12] i want you to catch that but
[55:15] god uses his mystical body in a
[55:18] particular
[55:19] way because it's a representative of his
[55:22] bride
[55:23] and she will act and do exactly
[55:27] amen like he has commanded
[55:30] for it to be done she will not miss
[55:34] a revelation she will be right on the
[55:37] cutting edge
[55:38] because we'll we found out that she is
[55:42] him is that right that's a quote
[55:46] all right now watch this
[55:49] now watch the mindset well i don't know
[55:53] where would you join yeah if if i don't
[55:56] come with this
[55:57] it'll be this way and i'll be kicked out
[56:00] over here
[56:02] and i won't have nothing to do here i
[56:04] mean these things
[56:06] this is exactly what's going on today in
[56:09] the minds and the hearts of people
[56:13] and it's a climax
[56:17] and brethren set down and say well
[56:21] what would i do if i see there they they
[56:24] won't stop
[56:24] long enough they
[56:27] won't stop long enough
[56:31] to recognize it's the word that god
[56:34] promised being manifested they won't
[56:38] stop long enough luke you don't have to
[56:41] put it up brothers but luke 14
[56:44] 17 sin is servant at suppertime to say
[56:47] to them that we're bidding come for all
[56:49] things are ready and they with all one
[56:50] consent
[56:53] began to make excuse don't you
[56:57] see that's what's going on here
[57:01] they won't stop long enough
[57:04] to recognize it's the word that god
[57:07] promised
[57:08] i believe they recognize it's god's word
[57:10] but
[57:11] not the one that was promised for their
[57:14] very hour that's what happened to jesus
[57:17] first coming
[57:19] he was the word of god being made
[57:21] manifest but they rejected
[57:23] the manifestation of it
[57:28] the god promised being manifested see
[57:30] and they walked
[57:31] away but don't worry
[57:35] the shadows plural
[57:39] are close at hand
[57:42] see now it looked like in chicago where
[57:46] do you say
[57:47] barely a ham i doubt being a handful
[57:50] down here the shadows are close
[57:54] at hand it says when i return to the
[57:57] field you remember the other night of
[57:59] the message that he gave me back yonder
[58:01] when i was laying the cornerstone just
[58:04] exactly said do the work
[58:06] said when you come out of this vision
[58:08] read ii timothy 4
[58:10] you know it's laying right there in the
[58:12] cornerstone 33 years ago
[58:15] he said do the work of an evangelist
[58:18] make full proof of your ministry for the
[58:19] time will come and they will not endure
[58:23] it doesn't say doctrine it says sound
[58:28] doctrine sound meaning firm meaning
[58:31] correct
[58:32] meaning appropriate and also airwaves
[58:39] sound doctrine but after their own
[58:43] lusts shall heap teachers having itching
[58:46] ears
[58:47] turned from fable from truth unto fables
[58:50] it hasn't
[58:51] been just word if that hasn't been just
[58:54] word by word
[58:55] but remember then the other night when i
[58:57] never did read the rest of it this is
[58:59] the part
[59:00] i read all this to get to this right
[59:01] here
[59:03] the 30-something years that i've
[59:05] preached in this tabernacle
[59:06] never one time
[59:10] now i want to ask you a question we're
[59:12] all visioning
[59:13] brother branham preaching in branham
[59:16] tabernacle
[59:18] but i also believe all scripture and all
[59:20] prophecy is compound
[59:22] and he's also standing in his tabernacle
[59:27] the 30-something years that i preached
[59:29] in this tabernacle never
[59:30] one time did i ever go any further than
[59:33] that
[59:33] and i don't know why
[59:39] this is god's prophet and that is
[59:41] something that god did not acknowledge
[59:44] nor reveal to him but he did do
[59:47] what god told him to do up to that
[59:50] point you with me amen i often wondered
[59:55] till one day i seen where jesus picked
[59:57] up the scroll
[59:58] and began to read now that is in luke 4
[1:00:00] and read
[1:00:01] half of the prophecy and stopped and
[1:00:03] said there in capernaum he said
[1:00:05] and this day this prophecy is fulfilled
[1:00:09] why didn't he read the rest of it
[1:00:12] it pertains to his second
[1:00:15] coming amen all right matthew 22
[1:00:20] verse 4 the first set
[1:00:23] of servants went out to call them that
[1:00:25] were bitten and they would not come
[1:00:27] verse 4 says and again
[1:00:29] he sent forth other
[1:00:32] servants not the same ones
[1:00:38] remember what brother branham said in
[1:00:39] that vision little birds beat up
[1:00:42] lots of them then the second round was
[1:00:46] a little bit bigger birds
[1:00:49] okay sent forth other servants saying
[1:00:53] tell
[1:00:53] them which are bidden here we go to the
[1:00:56] same group tell them which are bitten
[1:00:59] you see they're still adhering to god
[1:01:00] sent a prophet tell them which are bid
[1:01:03] and behold
[1:01:03] i've prepared my dinner my oxen my
[1:01:06] fatlings are killed
[1:01:07] all things are ready come under the
[1:01:08] marriage i want you to notice
[1:01:10] that god left that portion of the word
[1:01:13] to the servants
[1:01:15] the servants took what the servant
[1:01:17] brought
[1:01:18] and began to reveal the menu
[1:01:24] this says this and this means that and
[1:01:27] this
[1:01:27] ties in with this and this is over here
[1:01:32] you see he brought the gold nuggets but
[1:01:35] the servants are now
[1:01:36] polishing them and they're beginning to
[1:01:39] see the reflection of something
[1:01:40] in them and that reflection is beginning
[1:01:43] to identify
[1:01:45] what it is are you with me
[1:01:50] prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings
[1:01:52] are killed the things are ready
[1:01:54] you won't find that over there in luke
[1:01:56] 14.
[1:01:58] but they made light of it
[1:02:01] and went their way i could just imagine
[1:02:02] i've been made fun of
[1:02:04] oh yeah oh come on brother
[1:02:07] i mean i've been told this we don't
[1:02:09] preach the seven seals
[1:02:10] you don't what good are they then
[1:02:14] why did god send the revelation of the
[1:02:18] seven seals
[1:02:19] why did he take all that time to work
[1:02:22] his way up to the seals
[1:02:24] and then continue to minister about the
[1:02:26] seals afterwards what do you mean you
[1:02:28] don't need the seals
[1:02:32] well that's what i told them at the end
[1:02:34] of the conversation well you may not
[1:02:36] but i do yeah they made light of it amen
[1:02:42] and went their ways that's right notice
[1:02:45] their
[1:02:46] ways all right it's their revelation
[1:02:49] it wasn't the one that god sent through
[1:02:51] peter it was there
[1:02:53] some say your lies some say you're this
[1:02:55] their ways
[1:02:56] see one to his farm another to his
[1:02:59] merchandise
[1:03:01] and the remnant who's the remnant
[1:03:04] and the remnant took his servants
[1:03:08] and entreated them spitefully and
[1:03:12] slew them and as i was talking to
[1:03:15] brother
[1:03:16] wade today i mentioned this and and
[1:03:18] another
[1:03:19] brother you know that you don't have to
[1:03:21] kill somebody today
[1:03:22] to slay them you just have to work their
[1:03:25] influence
[1:03:26] onto the negative side of the tracks
[1:03:30] brother branham said this and you're
[1:03:31] killing their influence
[1:03:33] which is the same thing as destroying
[1:03:34] them
[1:03:36] look at the world we live in that's
[1:03:38] what's going on
[1:03:39] in the world we live in a man will stand
[1:03:42] up and try his
[1:03:44] best to to to maintain whatever
[1:03:47] principles that seem right
[1:03:51] and brother sister they'll kill his
[1:03:54] influence quicker and they
[1:03:55] that that's called the cancel culture
[1:04:00] and it's coming our way it's just that
[1:04:03] when they try to
[1:04:04] shut us up close us up
[1:04:07] we're going up i put the shut up in
[1:04:10] there because
[1:04:11] they want to stop the preaching of the
[1:04:12] gospel right
[1:04:14] if they can't stop the preaching of the
[1:04:16] gospel they'll close off the buildings
[1:04:17] and they'll begin to send out spies
[1:04:19] i was talking to a little sister
[1:04:21] yesterday and she said it's called
[1:04:22] see and say i think a commercial on the
[1:04:25] radio
[1:04:26] see and say you're supposed to turn your
[1:04:27] neighbor in now
[1:04:29] did you know that did you know this
[1:04:31] government wants you to turn
[1:04:32] your neighbor in for kicking the cat
[1:04:37] for abusing the dog that's right
[1:04:41] what people don't realize is that's how
[1:04:43] hitler got his power
[1:04:45] they call them brown shirts okay
[1:04:48] do i care about politics nope but i want
[1:04:50] everybody to understand there's two
[1:04:51] horns on one head
[1:04:53] one of those is politics and one of
[1:04:55] those is religion and brother branham
[1:04:57] says politics has got into the church
[1:04:58] and churches got into the politics
[1:05:01] following a part of the world and
[1:05:02] they're talking about nixon
[1:05:04] you can get it still with me who better
[1:05:08] hurry up
[1:05:08] but when the king ah
[1:05:12] now we're getting back to the king when
[1:05:15] the king heard thereof he was wroth
[1:05:18] and he sent forth his armies and
[1:05:20] destroyed those murderers and
[1:05:22] burned up their city hmm did you notice
[1:05:25] something
[1:05:26] they all come from one town oh
[1:05:29] then saith he to his servants no again
[1:05:33] it's plural this is the third time
[1:05:36] this is their opportunity for a pull the
[1:05:40] wedding
[1:05:41] is ready but they which were bidden
[1:05:45] were not worthy not worthiness in the
[1:05:50] way of the way they dressed or the way
[1:05:52] they carried it they rejected
[1:05:54] the word of god through the other
[1:05:57] servants
[1:05:59] reject it they'd have no part of it
[1:06:02] and brothers and sisters in just a
[1:06:04] second we're going to prove that it's
[1:06:05] the same exact message
[1:06:07] these servants are preaching the same
[1:06:10] message
[1:06:11] as the servant over in luke as the
[1:06:13] prophet
[1:06:15] preached the five-fold ministry that god
[1:06:18] has placed is going to preach
[1:06:19] and is preaching and will preach the
[1:06:22] same message
[1:06:24] but because the prophet of god said if
[1:06:26] timer to go on there would be more light
[1:06:29] not a different light i like to say that
[1:06:32] more
[1:06:33] light on the same word well it's kind of
[1:06:37] like this
[1:06:38] greater works than these shall ye do
[1:06:42] because i go to my father brother
[1:06:43] branham corrected that and said it's not
[1:06:45] greater
[1:06:46] but more why because there's more of us
[1:06:48] it's servants now
[1:06:50] it's not just a servant
[1:06:54] and don't be afraid this word has got to
[1:06:57] become that real
[1:06:58] right in your life it's got to become so
[1:07:02] real that you become
[1:07:05] not a mimic not a parrot
[1:07:10] but a carbon copy what's already been
[1:07:14] sent
[1:07:15] amen it's not a new word it's not a
[1:07:17] different word
[1:07:19] it's just that as time goes on more
[1:07:21] light shines
[1:07:22] on what never has had light on it before
[1:07:27] and becomes manifest and it scares the
[1:07:29] people to death
[1:07:31] because if they don't understand it they
[1:07:32] think it's some kind of a
[1:07:35] mystical mystic you know what i mean
[1:07:38] some kind of mysterious whoa it's
[1:07:40] witchcraft oh
[1:07:42] it's spiritualism oh it's not if that
[1:07:45] person's
[1:07:45] life is walking the walk
[1:07:49] and talking the talk you with me
[1:07:52] i'll finish watch this the wedding is
[1:07:56] ready but they which were bidden were
[1:07:58] not worthy
[1:07:58] go ye therefore into the highways and as
[1:08:01] many as ye shall find bid to the
[1:08:02] marriage
[1:08:03] here's the same message go to the
[1:08:05] highways
[1:08:06] all right find them so those servants
[1:08:09] went out of the highways and gathered
[1:08:11] together
[1:08:12] all as many as they found both bad
[1:08:15] and good
[1:08:18] so you see brothers and sisters it's not
[1:08:20] how bad
[1:08:22] and or good you are it's whether you
[1:08:25] receive the call
[1:08:27] because what'll happen is if you receive
[1:08:30] this
[1:08:30] call in your soul what you think is good
[1:08:35] and what you're doing that's bad
[1:08:39] will find its way into the middle of the
[1:08:42] road
[1:08:44] and you'll be just like him
[1:08:48] you don't think that they didn't call
[1:08:49] him bad beelzebub
[1:08:53] they called him king
[1:08:57] of the devils here's a certain king
[1:09:02] but he's working in a different way
[1:09:06] they went out into the highways and got
[1:09:07] her together all as many as they found
[1:09:09] both bad and good and the wedding was
[1:09:10] furnished with guests
[1:09:14] praise the lord because i was one of
[1:09:17] those
[1:09:19] and when the king came in to see the
[1:09:22] guests
[1:09:22] here we go you talked about the coming
[1:09:25] of the lord
[1:09:26] now the lord has arrived
[1:09:30] and he has arrived i want you to see the
[1:09:32] timeline he said he's arrived
[1:09:34] to see the guests
[1:09:38] he saw there a man which had not
[1:09:41] on a wedding garment
[1:09:46] this is previous to the rapture then in
[1:09:48] that
[1:09:49] and he saith unto him friend
[1:09:53] you see he still wanted him to come in
[1:09:55] he just wanted him to come in right
[1:09:58] friend how camest thou in hither
[1:10:02] not having a wedding garment on now the
[1:10:05] lord
[1:10:06] knows how this man got in there but what
[1:10:08] he's looking for
[1:10:10] is the man's answer he's giving him an
[1:10:14] opportunity just like he gave
[1:10:16] cain cain why are you so roth
[1:10:19] you just do what your brother did
[1:10:22] to get my confidence
[1:10:26] and you're good oh no
[1:10:29] king got jealous like his daddy
[1:10:32] and his daddy was not adam
[1:10:36] and what did he do slew
[1:10:40] that servant how cameth thou and hither
[1:10:43] not having a wedding garment and he
[1:10:45] was speechless
[1:10:48] do you know why i got this written i
[1:10:50] wrote this down he had no
[1:10:52] revelation of how he got there therefore
[1:10:55] he
[1:10:55] could not express to the king
[1:10:58] how the garment got
[1:11:02] where it was supposed to be was
[1:11:04] speechless
[1:11:06] he couldn't say nothing because he had
[1:11:09] nothing to say but you get somebody in a
[1:11:11] corner who's got revelation and they'll
[1:11:13] talk their way right out of that corner
[1:11:17] preaching all the way is that right
[1:11:21] then said the king to the servants bind
[1:11:23] them hand and foot
[1:11:24] take them away cast them into outer
[1:11:26] darkness there shall be weeping
[1:11:28] and gnashing of teeth for many are
[1:11:31] called but few
[1:11:33] are chosen what is the remnant of verse
[1:11:36] 6
[1:11:37] it would have to be the foolish virgin
[1:11:38] because down here in verse 13
[1:11:40] brother branham tells us that the
[1:11:42] foolish virgin is cast
[1:11:44] into outer darkness that doesn't mean
[1:11:47] they're cast out into space
[1:11:49] that means they become speechless
[1:11:53] no light can reach there they'll have
[1:11:56] nothing to say
[1:11:57] so they'll run for their lives when
[1:12:00] they're confronted by the authorities
[1:12:02] who are out looking for you and me and
[1:12:05] guess what brothers and sisters
[1:12:07] we are gone
[1:12:11] did you know the prophet of god said it
[1:12:12] like this that you could be sitting
[1:12:15] next to somebody or you could be that
[1:12:17] somebody sitting next to somebody and
[1:12:19] they're receiving it and you're not
[1:12:23] let's not find ourselves like that you
[1:12:25] see because then you become speechless
[1:12:29] and all that god has for his children
[1:12:33] that might be for you would be set aside
[1:12:36] and it would become outer darkness
[1:12:40] there's a place in the message where
[1:12:41] brother branham says now there are so
[1:12:43] many
[1:12:43] just so many places set it
[1:12:46] allotted and if you don't take your
[1:12:50] place this is what he says someone will
[1:12:52] take it
[1:12:53] for you please stand there's oh so much
[1:12:57] more of it that's where i want to stop
[1:12:58] right there
[1:13:01] you love him amen amen i hope you still
