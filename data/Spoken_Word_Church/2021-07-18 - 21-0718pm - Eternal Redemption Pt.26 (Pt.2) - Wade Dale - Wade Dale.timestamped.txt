[0:04] god bless you all
[0:06] i'll try to keep it short but i can be
[0:08] seated
[0:10] um this is a really it's an older
[0:12] testimony i've told it to
[0:13] my friends before but uh someone told me
[0:15] to say it you know this sunday so i hope
[0:18] it'll be a blessing
[0:20] um this could have been four or five
[0:22] years ago but
[0:23] it was actually at the be wise
[0:27] is that the byc camp meetings about four
[0:30] or five years ago
[0:31] and i um i remember i used to
[0:34] be very anxious about my future and what
[0:38] you know what was in my future and
[0:40] sometimes it would keep me up at night
[0:42] or i'd be worried about what's gonna
[0:43] happen tomorrow
[0:44] or what's good or what i'm gonna do you
[0:46] know five years from now and it would
[0:48] always keep me up it would stress me out
[0:50] and i would always like have this
[0:51] problem and i knew as a christian like
[0:52] we weren't supposed to
[0:54] supposed to give it in god's hands and
[0:56] not worry about it and just give it to
[0:57] him
[0:58] so these cam meetings come around
[1:02] and i just want to be delivered of that
[1:03] and i had this uh
[1:05] this phrase in my head that's like i
[1:08] just want
[1:09] there was a line to get prayed for so i
[1:11] had a phrase in my head to say like
[1:13] i i want to give my future to god and
[1:15] that was what i wanted to do
[1:17] so i had that in my head and i went up
[1:18] to the line
[1:20] and i remember i got to the front of the
[1:24] line
[1:24] and there was exactly a girl in front of
[1:26] me being prayed for
[1:28] and as she was being prayed for
[1:31] the song started to play because he
[1:32] lives i can face tomorrow
[1:36] and even before i was prayed for i
[1:38] received it right there
[1:40] and i've never had that problem since
[1:42] and i still
[1:43] i still haven't prayed for i still you
[1:44] know went through the motions but i
[1:46] believe
[1:46] even before i was prayed for right in
[1:48] the line they played the song because he
[1:50] lives
[1:51] and and that it was given like almost
[1:53] like a new revelation of that song to me
[1:55] and you know a lot of times we listen to
[1:56] songs and we just we sing through them
[1:58] and go through the motions but
[2:00] if you listen really really listen to
[2:01] the lyrics and
[2:04] really you know pay attention right
[2:06] there's some good stuff in there it's
[2:07] not just
[2:08] it's not just you know we're here to
[2:10] sing and it's just a routine sometimes
[2:11] it's some really good stuff in those
[2:12] lyrics so
[2:14] i hope it'll be a blessing to you um

[19:08] we'll bring you up speed a little bit
[19:09] more in just a few minutes but if you
[19:11] got your bibles let's turn to hebrews
[19:13] and continue our thought we got to a
[19:16] spot this morning
[19:18] and i hope you understood what i was
[19:20] talking about with
[19:22] with job and leviticus there with the
[19:25] with the um jubilee year because that
[19:28] jubilee year was
[19:29] never it was never accomplished
[19:32] in the time of the jews that's why god
[19:35] put him into captivity and
[19:37] even said he was going to let the land
[19:38] rest for 50 years because they wouldn't
[19:40] they just kept planting crops and first
[19:42] one thing in another
[19:43] because god's going to always make sure
[19:45] he does what he said he was going to do
[19:46] but on that 50th year if you went free
[19:49] you were free if not then you stayed
[19:52] where you were at and you got born in
[19:54] the air with an awl
[19:56] amen that's why you know you look in the
[20:00] end time when you see
[20:01] sorry you see these people with their
[20:03] ears pierced
[20:08] just saying is that not a is that not a
[20:11] type
[20:14] of being bored in the ear with an awl
[20:16] and you're not being able to hear the
[20:18] word of god
[20:19] because you're doing something you're
[20:20] not supposed to do
[20:22] we we tr we try to like brother luis
[20:24] said we try to be
[20:26] we're in the world but we're not we're
[20:27] not of the world
[20:29] that's why we try to walk different
[20:30] that's why we try to walk by the bible
[20:33] and try to do as christians do
[20:37] according to the bible not according to
[20:38] somebody's
[20:40] law or somebody's denomination like i
[20:44] said this morning
[20:45] and we're going to read it here in amos
[20:47] that god does
[20:48] nothing until he reveals it to his
[20:50] servants the prophets first
[20:52] then that prophet does not stay silent
[20:54] and cannot stay silent
[20:56] he has to speak he has to prophesy
[20:59] he says what the lion hath roared who
[21:01] will not fear in other words that person
[21:03] is going to have to speak
[21:04] so let's not be scared now we need to be
[21:06] scared a false prophet
[21:08] but if you know who the true prophet is
[21:11] then you'll know who the false prophet
[21:13] is the problem is a lot of people don't
[21:14] know who the true prophet is so they
[21:16] take the false prophet as the truth
[21:18] as we're as we were talking about the
[21:19] beast
[21:21] and we'll talk about him the antichrist
[21:23] see everybody whole world's deceived by
[21:25] the whole world is deceived by the beast
[21:28] or the antichrist in in the end time
[21:30] now when the bride leaves the world this
[21:34] whole world is deceived by one man
[21:37] and he's a false prophet he's not a real
[21:39] prophet amen
[21:41] so let's just get into the book of
[21:42] hebrews 9 verse 11.
[21:46] just pray for us and uh continue to pray
[21:49] for brother dale
[21:50] and and hold him up mom too
[21:53] and all of us together the whole the
[21:56] whole bride body
[21:58] there's just one big family so we love
[22:01] you with the love of the lord and thank
[22:02] you for all those things hebrews 9.
[22:05] remember brother joe canada and then
[22:07] we'll be back this afternoon
[22:09] and brother aaron and sister sarah is
[22:11] going to be going
[22:12] out to wyoming and different places just
[22:14] pray that you bless them and also

[22:24] time to go get away time to get away and
[22:27] go to some of these places you can see
[22:29] some of these places we're gonna have to
[22:30] wait the millennium to go see but that's
[22:32] okay
[22:33] i don't think i want to go the middle
[22:34] east at this moment i think i'll wait
[22:36] and go
[22:37] i think that's where we're gonna live
[22:38] for a few thousand years so you know for
[22:40] a thousand years at least so it'll be
[22:41] okay
[22:42] we'll be able to roam around travel like

[22:45] anybody else or get caught in
[22:47] or get cut yeah or get called in get
[22:50] caught in a uh
[22:51] a line there with a tsa so it won't be
[22:53] no tsa

[24:05] ones
[24:05] they're coming in now brother aaron
[24:07] brother danny and sis george that are
[24:09] traveling lord on vacation we pray that
[24:11] you just touch them bring them back safe
[24:13] together here
[24:14] they will all be one together in you
[24:16] father in jesus name we ask these things
[24:19] amen y'all be praying for the youth
[24:21] services coming up we're trying to have
[24:22] them again
[24:23] so we want to uh we want to help the
[24:26] youth and answer some questions and
[24:28] and and i was looking at questions and
[24:32] answers
[24:33] uh brother branham was talking about
[24:35] different things and it's where he said
[24:37] you know questions make a strong church
[24:40] so if you have questions then you need
[24:41] to ask i always enjoyed them brother
[24:42] dale did questions and answers for a
[24:44] long time ago before
[24:46] some of y'all started coming here there
[24:48] used to be a question box in the back
[24:50] wasn't it like was an old bible case or
[24:52] something it was a question had a little
[24:53] slit in it's a question box and people
[24:54] would be able to
[24:56] anonymously slide a question in every
[24:59] once in a while you know and
[25:01] and that was good we able to somebody
[25:03] that brother dale was able to answer
[25:05] those questions so maybe we can get back
[25:06] to that a little bit
[25:07] but if you have a question in your mind
[25:09] then you know we we want to be able to
[25:11] let the lord answer because he's got the
[25:12] answers to all questions
[25:14] amen hebrews 9 but christ being coming
[25:17] high priests are good things to come by
[25:18] a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[25:20] not made with hands that is to say not
[25:21] of this building
[25:23] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[25:24] but by his own blood
[25:26] he entered in once into the holy place
[25:28] having obtained
[25:29] eternal redemption for us now let's go
[25:31] to amos three
[25:33] we're going to cover this a little bit
[25:35] more this afternoon
[25:37] and then then we're going to get to the
[25:38] two prophets brother donnie i promise
[25:40] you today we're at least going to say
[25:41] two prophets i just said it so we don't
[25:43] have to do it again
[25:45] surely the lord god will do nothing
[25:48] look at that by if you got your bible if
[25:50] you don't have a look right up here
[25:51] surely the lord god capital god will do
[25:55] nothing but he revealeth his secret
[25:59] unto his servant servants
[26:02] the prophets we know he sent us a string
[26:04] of servant of prophets
[26:06] down through the bible so let's not be
[26:09] so scared that god sent us a prophet in
[26:11] the end time
[26:12] okay because he's not going to do
[26:14] anything unless he reveals it to his
[26:15] servants the prophet first
[26:17] and then the lion hath roared who will
[26:19] not fear the lord god hath spoken
[26:22] who can but prophesy so in other words
[26:23] the anointing that's on that person
[26:25] is going to transfer
[26:29] because he has the mind of god he has
[26:30] the voice of god he's speaking something
[26:32] to you
[26:32] but remember it's not going to return
[26:35] void so it's got to hit
[26:36] something it's got to go in
[26:39] something right or
[26:43] it's just vain jangling it's just words
[26:44] that are spoken but no he sent a prophet
[26:47] to tell us something and not to the
[26:49] whole world because the whole world
[26:50] could accept it
[26:52] but they don't so we only sent it to a
[26:54] select group of people
[26:55] in that age and we know what that is for
[26:58] the end time now so look in revelations
[27:00] 11
[27:00] 3 and i will give power unto my two
[27:03] witnesses and they shall prophesy
[27:05] so there's two prophets going to israel
[27:08] and that they shall prophesy
[27:10] one thousand two hundred three score
[27:12] days that's 260 days or three and a half
[27:14] years according to the prophetic
[27:16] calendar
[27:17] clothed in sackcloth so you may be
[27:19] seated the lord has blessing
[27:21] and we're just going to kind of jump
[27:22] through from this morning if that's all
[27:24] right
[27:25] we'll not go to leviticus where we were
[27:27] talking about the jubilee year
[27:29] but we'll continue down to revelations 1
[27:31] verse 13 brother anderson
[27:33] if you would keep that chart handy
[27:37] we may pull it up in just a minute if
[27:38] that's all right hey man we love the
[27:40] brothers in the back they
[27:42] even without brother joe here they're
[27:43] doing a good job they do a good job
[27:45] anyway they kind of all work hand in
[27:46] hand anyway
[27:51] that's why i said about the mark of a
[27:52] true church and market with two churches
[27:54] if somebody's out there's somebody to
[27:55] fill the place and there's not really
[27:57] that much of a gap
[27:58] you know as far as filling the place
[28:01] back up so we
[28:02] we really enjoy that because god i like
[28:04] god god's
[28:05] in continuity god god flows god's not
[28:08] somebody just says well i think i'll do
[28:10] this and then i think it didn't work so
[28:11] i think i didn't know
[28:12] whatever he thought that's what worked
[28:14] right amen
[28:16] whatever he thought that's what's going
[28:18] to work
[28:20] so we see now in revelations 1 we've
[28:22] been through all the eternal redemption
[28:23] how god had to sin
[28:25] had to come himself as the lord jesus
[28:27] christ and he had to be the savior of
[28:28] the world
[28:29] and he had to die on a cross and he was
[28:32] resurrected
[28:33] and what happened on the day of
[28:35] pentecost is that
[28:36] same man in the form of the holy ghost
[28:39] now he said i'll come back
[28:41] there in the in the scriptures he says
[28:43] i'll come back
[28:45] i'll send a comforter i'll come back and
[28:48] he'll come in my name
[28:50] and he'll come in my father's name so
[28:52] what's the name of the father
[28:54] father's not a name like water baptism
[28:57] father's not a name
[28:58] son is not a name holy ghost is not a
[29:00] name that's a title to a name
[29:02] what is the name of god the lord jesus
[29:05] christ
[29:06] amen jehovah's not even the name
[29:08] jehovah's a title
[29:10] god's not even a name amen
[29:14] god's not even a name there has to be a
[29:16] name attached
[29:17] because when the bible says everybody in
[29:20] heaven is going to be named one name and
[29:22] that's jesus christ and
[29:23] if there's only one god then that's
[29:25] jesus christ
[29:26] and then you and i are called what mrs
[29:29] jesus christ
[29:30] being the bride amen in the midst of the
[29:33] seven candlesticks so he came back on
[29:35] the day of pentecost
[29:37] into the 120 people and they went out
[29:40] and started the gentile
[29:42] dispensation because god had to put
[29:44] israel away because they
[29:48] i don't want to say the word went
[29:49] whoring but that's what the bible says
[29:51] they in other words they took on another
[29:52] husband while they were supposed to be
[29:54] married to christ they
[29:55] took on another husband called the devil
[29:57] called baal called bell ill
[29:59] all the different things that they got
[30:01] their self mixed up with
[30:03] and god said okay i got to put you away
[30:04] because i can't take you back because
[30:06] you've been defiled
[30:07] all right and under that defilement god
[30:09] couldn't take them back but he couldn't
[30:11] forget israel because they were the
[30:12] apple of his eye they were the ones he
[30:14] started with
[30:15] but then there was a gentile bride that
[30:17] he would come for
[30:19] in the to the 2000 years
[30:22] of church ages and this is the church
[30:24] ages revelations 1
[30:26] verse 13 says in the midst of the seven
[30:29] candlesticks
[30:30] one likened to the son of man clothed
[30:32] with a garment down to the foot and gird
[30:34] about the pounds with the golden girdle
[30:36] now we know the pabst is up here that's
[30:37] the breast that's feminist
[30:39] so he was in bright form you're not
[30:41] going to see jesus christ on this earth
[30:43] everybody understand that right
[30:44] the physical man jesus is not going to
[30:46] be here until
[30:48] the millennium if not then he's got two
[30:51] bodies and this is his body his
[30:53] spiritual body
[30:54] you and i are going to meet him in the
[30:56] air he's not coming back here in a
[30:58] physical form
[30:59] he's coming back in a spiritual form but
[31:01] he's going to go into physical you
[31:04] amen the son of man is going to be
[31:07] physical in your flesh
[31:10] but we're going to meet him in the air
[31:12] if not he would have two bodies
[31:14] he's heading his hair with white like
[31:15] walls white is snowing his eyes flame of
[31:17] fire
[31:18] see that shows me also we were talking
[31:19] about this morning that's not going
[31:21] through the tribulation period the bride
[31:22] will not go through the tribulation
[31:24] period i read a few more
[31:25] quotes back there talking about enoch
[31:27] and different ones
[31:29] and the five wives and the five foolish
[31:30] virgin the five wise virgins they got up
[31:32] got the call and they went on with the
[31:34] bridegroom right
[31:35] the five foolish virgins had to stay
[31:37] here because they didn't have enough
[31:39] oil they didn't have any holy ghost
[31:42] to take them out of here so they had to
[31:44] stay and go through the tribulation
[31:46] period
[31:46] so the church does go through the
[31:48] tribulation period
[31:50] but the bride does not go through the
[31:52] tribulation period amen
[31:54] that's why you need to see that's why
[31:56] the study of god had to send a prophet
[31:58] to tell us the difference between the
[32:00] church and the bride right
[32:02] because you look and you see as brother
[32:03] branham said he said you know somebody
[32:05] said well brother brown i see the
[32:07] woman in the sun and i see this woman
[32:08] here and i see this over here and i see
[32:10] this over here
[32:10] he said you got that mixed up he said
[32:12] there's a church and there's a bride
[32:14] right amen there's a church nominal out
[32:17] there
[32:19] that this can be saved and sanctified
[32:22] come on brothers and sisters i mean
[32:24] we're not inclusive
[32:26] right okay we're definitely exclusive
[32:29] but we are
[32:30] exclusive to god but you're not going to
[32:33] do away but
[32:34] they're not going to get the position
[32:35] that you and i get same way with like
[32:37] israel
[32:38] israel couldn't take the position of
[32:40] bride anymore because she did what she
[32:42] did
[32:43] me and you can't take the well anyway
[32:47] we're bright right by the new birth
[32:50] we're bright we are not bright just
[32:51] because we live here
[32:52] we're not bright just because we say the
[32:54] message of the hour is correct
[32:56] we're bribed because the bible tells us
[32:58] that we need to be justified sanctified
[33:00] and filled with the holy ghost not just
[33:03] an anointing and not just a feeling and
[33:05] not just a
[33:06] i believe jesus died on the cross well
[33:08] you know what the devil believes that
[33:09] too because he was there and watched it
[33:13] the devil was back in eternity well he
[33:16] was in eternity but
[33:18] he wasn't eternal but he was back in
[33:19] that part of time or no time where there
[33:21] was no time
[33:22] he was back there with god right
[33:26] he saw the development of all this he
[33:28] just don't believe he's an unbeliever
[33:31] figure that i mean he is
[33:34] but this tells us right here his head
[33:36] and his hair was white like what if he's
[33:38] in bribe
[33:38] form he is a judge so the bible says the
[33:42] saints will judge the earth that's like
[33:43] i said before we were talking about this
[33:45] morning
[33:46] when you look in revelations there when
[33:47] we read where there were thrones
[33:52] thrones plural by people sitting on the
[33:54] throne that was in
[33:55] not being judged but given the right to
[33:58] judge well that's what the bride is
[34:01] right here his head in his hair was
[34:02] white like wool
[34:03] white of snow what the wig of the judge
[34:06] yes and his eyes was flames of fire and
[34:08] his feet like in the fine grass now
[34:10] what the prophet of god tell us brass
[34:12] you look up brass in the old testament
[34:14] i mean in the new testament it means
[34:15] judgment right
[34:17] amen so there you are the bride is
[34:20] standing not
[34:21] in judgment but judging the whole world
[34:24] out of those 2 000 years of seven church
[34:28] ages
[34:28] that's where your judgment is going to
[34:30] be coming from
[34:32] amen right and his feet was locking the
[34:35] brass and they burned in a furnace in
[34:36] his voice
[34:38] as the sound of many waters waters is
[34:39] what people
[34:41] and he had in his hands seven stars so
[34:44] he had the stars in his hand
[34:47] excuse me and what happened out of his
[34:51] mouth when a two
[34:52] sharp two-edged sword what the word of
[34:54] god in those seven people
[34:56] and his countenance was as the sun
[34:57] shineth in the strength when i saw him i
[34:59] fell as my feet is dead
[35:01] laid his right hand on me and said unto
[35:02] me fear not i am the first and last he
[35:04] was identifying who he was
[35:06] and where he was i am he that liveth and
[35:08] was dead and behold i am alive
[35:10] forevermore
[35:11] and have the keys of hell and of death
[35:13] write these things which als
[35:15] you've seen and things which are things
[35:16] will shall be hereafter
[35:18] here's the part here the mystery scroll
[35:20] it all the way up
[35:23] or down whichever one verse 20. the
[35:25] mystery of the seven stars
[35:26] which thou saw us in our right hand and
[35:29] the seven golden candle sticks the seven
[35:30] stars are the angels now we look that
[35:32] word up
[35:33] angels it's not an angel listen angels
[35:36] don't have wings
[35:38] man came up with that god didn't
[35:42] because but look man with man well if
[35:44] angels can fly
[35:45] they got to have wings and then you see
[35:47] the ones in ezekiel that had wings
[35:49] but they weren't angels they were
[35:50] creatures right right
[35:52] yeah so you just got to read watch your
[35:54] terminology
[35:55] all right that's why there's no women
[35:57] angels that's right
[35:59] they're all men amen
[36:03] the seven stars are the angels of the
[36:05] seven churches now
[36:06] you have to identify that in the greek
[36:08] lexicon it tells us that is a messenger
[36:11] from god an envoy one who is sent an
[36:14] angel
[36:15] a prophet amos said it had to be sent to
[36:19] you
[36:19] a messenger from god to what bring you a
[36:23] specific message
[36:25] so you can prophesy the prophet of god
[36:27] tells us you could profit
[36:28] the gift of prophecy could be to someone
[36:30] in this building
[36:32] and it could fall on brother donnie and
[36:34] he could stand up and prophesy
[36:37] and never do it again god used him one
[36:40] time there'd be a spirit of prophecy
[36:41] following brother donny he stand up and
[36:43] prophesy
[36:44] that didn't make him that does not make
[36:45] him a prophet
[36:48] a prophet has a message a prophet has a
[36:51] specific message and down through the
[36:53] seven church ages
[36:54] there was paul irenaeus martin columba
[36:56] luther wesley and the prophet of god in
[36:58] the end time
[36:59] that brought specific messages as we
[37:01] were talking this morning
[37:03] and brother paul so so valiantly he
[37:06] picked up what i was
[37:07] i was trying to find you remember you're
[37:09] a smith
[37:10] euros smith is the one that brother
[37:11] brown used a lot of times in some of his
[37:13] charts too and i kept trying to think of
[37:15] that and he said
[37:16] you forgot to say you're a smith so uh
[37:18] thanks for sitting right there in the
[37:19] front row and telling me
[37:20] that i missed something i appreciate
[37:22] that yeah
[37:24] you mean he sold the people i hope russ
[37:28] is watching him he does you okay all
[37:31] right
[37:31] that's scary so anyway
[37:36] but a messenger from god you saw all
[37:38] these minor messages though that came
[37:40] from yura smith
[37:41] that came from clarence larkin that came
[37:43] from moody calvin
[37:45] even um you look at oral roberts billy
[37:48] graham all the great men
[37:50] that we're not doing away with them
[37:53] they have their place but remember they
[37:56] weren't placed in the bible and had the
[37:59] had the manifestation according to what
[38:01] the bible said right
[38:04] now everybody will understand what i'm
[38:06] saying right
[38:09] clarence larkin was not in malachi 4.
[38:11] right right
[38:12] that's right now he could be a preacher
[38:15] but he didn't have a message to a church
[38:17] age
[38:18] a specific message like the prophet of
[38:20] god did
[38:21] and he was vindicated all over the world
[38:25] and he was vindicated here in malachi 4.
[38:27] so let's read malachi 4.
[38:29] behold i will send you elijah the
[38:31] prophet
[38:33] now remember we we talked about this
[38:35] morning we're going to kind of just
[38:36] glance over to save time
[38:38] because we are going to get to the two
[38:39] prophets
[38:41] i think i think we may not get there
[38:45] but that's okay we listen we'll
[38:46] background as much as we need the
[38:48] background somebody needs it he needs to
[38:49] be
[38:50] you know the background i don't want to
[38:52] lose nobody
[38:53] behold i will send you elijah the
[38:55] prophet before the coming of the great
[38:56] and dreadful day of the lord now the
[38:57] first elijah that came was back in kings
[39:00] elijah himself the number one
[39:04] and he didn't restore before
[39:07] he smoked the earth with a curse and he
[39:09] wasn't one
[39:10] came before the great battle day of the
[39:12] lord he was back in the old testament
[39:15] but we know that the characteristics of
[39:16] the prophet elijah had to be given to us
[39:19] five different times
[39:20] elijah elisha john the baptist william
[39:23] branham
[39:24] and then the one that's going because
[39:26] they're looking for elijah
[39:28] i'm going to read it here in a minute
[39:29] those two prophets when they go to
[39:30] israel
[39:31] they're looking for elijah according to
[39:33] malachi 4 because remember
[39:37] excuse me the bible stops right here to
[39:42] a jew
[39:44] everybody got that all right what are we
[39:46] doing
[39:49] oh thank you son that's my boy
[39:53] what kind of cough drop is that ask
[39:55] christine i don't know
[39:56] ask for who that's christina ask who
[39:59] that's christine that's good i'm gonna
[40:01] talk like a girl she's gonna give me
[40:03] something
[40:06] thank you sister christine let's see
[40:09] right here
[40:18] never again
[40:22] i'll get over this in a minute boy
[40:24] that's tough the bible stops right here
[40:27] for for the children of israel i mean
[40:28] for for israel because there's no
[40:30] matthew mark luke and john everybody got
[40:32] that
[40:32] so what they're doing they're reading
[40:34] like we're reading revelations
[40:36] they're reading malachi 4 behold i will
[40:38] send you talking to the
[40:39] israel i will send you elijah to the
[40:41] prophet before the coming of the great
[40:42] and dreadful death of the lord so they
[40:43] say
[40:45] under their interpretation of what they
[40:48] see
[40:49] this ain't good from what they see
[40:55] i'm gonna i hope there's something good
[40:57] inside that when it gets done
[41:02] it's got a different taste to it but
[41:04] thank you i'm sorry take you i'll i'll
[41:06] i'll use it but they're thinking that
[41:09] that elijah has got to show up before
[41:11] jesus shows up before their messiah
[41:13] shows up
[41:14] right because of that scripture right
[41:17] there
[41:18] but now according to scripture when
[41:20] we're going to read in zechariah
[41:22] when those two prophets go over there
[41:24] and tell reveal to them that they miss
[41:26] that elijah coming right
[41:30] right they're going to say oh my we
[41:31] killed the messiah we we're way behind
[41:35] we're looking at elijah number number
[41:37] one
[41:38] and we've already been almo we're
[41:39] getting elijah number five
[41:42] and we'll read that in just a minute i
[41:44] hope brother donnie we will
[41:46] but there's a specific thing that he's
[41:48] got to do
[41:50] he's going to turn the heart of the
[41:51] fathers to the children we know that was
[41:52] john the baptist
[41:54] because he was standing between this old
[41:57] testament
[41:59] and the new testament right
[42:02] he was an old testament prophet still he
[42:05] was in the old testament
[42:06] prophesying under jesus time
[42:09] to what he didn't come to he came to
[42:12] turn the hearts of the old
[42:15] old jewish orthodox old testament
[42:19] to the faith of the new children the 120
[42:21] that's going to be in the upper room
[42:24] to a new message everybody got that
[42:28] all right yes yes okay one more time
[42:31] sister freda says you didn't understand
[42:32] that that's okay we're gonna guard it
[42:33] again
[42:34] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[42:38] orthodox old testament
[42:41] fathers older than a child right
[42:45] father's older than a child so he's
[42:47] going to turn this this
[42:48] is john the baptist that's why it's head
[42:50] folks that's why it took a profit
[42:53] to tell us how to separate these things
[42:57] just like that one little word we read
[42:58] we're in judgment not of judgment
[43:01] all right and he shall turn to the heart
[43:04] of the fathers
[43:06] old testament fathers
[43:09] yes the 12 tribes of israel
[43:13] he was trying to get caiaphas in all
[43:15] them too but caiaphas is not going to
[43:18] he's not going to take it right but
[43:19] that's the old are you getting it now
[43:21] the old testament
[43:23] to the children which he's saying all
[43:26] right
[43:26] what's john the baptist doing we don't
[43:28] we're not going to get to do prophets
[43:30] today
[43:31] what did john the baptist do he stood
[43:34] between the old testament and the new
[43:35] testament
[43:37] because he is his job his message was
[43:39] only six months long
[43:41] right right that's right preach six
[43:44] months
[43:45] didn't heal a person that wasn't his
[43:47] message
[43:49] his message was the voice of one malachi
[43:52] 3.
[43:52] i didn't bring that didn't know i was
[43:53] going this way but we're going this way
[43:55] malachi 3
[43:56] was what i am the voice of one crying in
[43:59] the wilderness now what did john do
[44:02] john at nine years old
[44:05] y'all don't try this
[44:08] went back into the wilderness and eat
[44:10] locust and wild honey
[44:13] right right came out of the wilderness
[44:16] the voice of one crying in the
[44:18] wilderness
[44:19] saying behold in other words the lamb of
[44:21] god that takes away the sin of the world
[44:24] there was a new message coming it wasn't
[44:26] going to be under the law it wasn't
[44:28] going to be under the
[44:29] the judges and the kings and all these
[44:31] different things in the old testament
[44:34] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[44:36] the sin of the world is going to be
[44:37] something new
[44:38] jesus christ had never stepped foot on
[44:40] the earth since
[44:41] that time old testament he spoke to
[44:44] prophets he spoke through these
[44:45] different ones
[44:46] but there was the man there was god
[44:50] almighty in human flesh and john saw he
[44:53] said the
[44:54] the one i cease the spirit descend and
[44:57] remain
[44:58] right that's right remember he was a
[45:00] prophet he could see in another
[45:02] dimension
[45:04] now the bible was specific i believe
[45:05] when god told john he said hey now look
[45:08] john you're going to see the anointing
[45:10] fall on different people
[45:11] because remember them in pharisees they
[45:13] were always around john
[45:15] they were always wanting to mess up
[45:19] right and they might have seen the
[45:21] spirit of god
[45:22] anoint them sure but it would lift off
[45:25] of them
[45:27] but now the bible says john the one you
[45:30] see that the spirit descends and remains
[45:35] that's the one that you identify as the
[45:37] savior of the world that's me
[45:39] that's the one that's going to save the
[45:41] world because confidence couldn't save
[45:43] the world
[45:44] you can't save the world with just an
[45:46] anointing and anointing come off but
[45:47] you've got to be the one that is the
[45:48] anointing and you got to be the anointed
[45:51] amen amen so that's what john did
[45:55] he turned the hearts of the fathers to
[45:56] the children in other words
[45:59] right here to the because they became
[46:02] children
[46:03] before they became adults
[46:06] that's just pretty simple and
[46:10] putting two together not not showing
[46:12] that
[46:13] this is just this is john the baptist
[46:16] and this has to be a prophet in the end
[46:18] time
[46:18] before i come and smite the earth with a
[46:20] curse everybody got that
[46:24] and he shall turn the heart of the
[46:25] father's what the heart
[46:27] your soul yeah the soul of you he's
[46:30] going to turn your thinking
[46:32] around and send you in another direction
[46:37] so john the baptist took the old
[46:40] testament
[46:42] people and introduced them to a new
[46:44] message
[46:47] all right not bulls and goats got it now
[46:51] not bulls and goats not not lavers and
[46:55] going doing saying hail mary's and you
[46:57] understand what i mean
[46:59] but here's the man's gonna save the
[47:01] world by coming and shedding his blood
[47:03] the supreme sacrifice the lamb of god
[47:07] that will take away the sin of the world
[47:09] this only covered the sin of the world
[47:11] john knew that this only covered it or
[47:14] capo
[47:15] covered this over here eradicated
[47:18] the sin of the world behold the lamb of
[47:20] god that takes away
[47:22] the sin of the world so there's john and
[47:24] six months later he was dead
[47:25] yeah god used him six months that's all
[47:28] he had right
[47:29] but you know what one of the most
[47:30] powerful what about a preacher what
[47:33] about a priest what about a prophet
[47:35] that his only job was to introduce the
[47:37] messiah
[47:40] and without him you didn't get
[47:44] introduced to the messiah
[47:46] because what did he do
[47:50] behold
[47:55] because you can see john's he's sitting
[47:57] he's baptizing people he's probably
[47:59] he's not baptizing him in the name of
[48:01] jesus christ because he didn't know that
[48:02] yet
[48:03] but he's baptizing them unto repentance
[48:06] and all of a sudden a man walks up right
[48:09] right
[48:10] just a common man
[48:13] no beauty that man should desire him he
[48:15] didn't stick out in the crowd
[48:18] and that prophet like brother brown said
[48:19] that prophet's eyes met that prophet's
[48:21] eyes
[48:23] and when that prophesy i met that other
[48:24] prophet that prophet saw met his
[48:26] bet his maker he said
[48:29] behold yes amen the lamb of god
[48:34] that'll take away the sin of the world
[48:35] pointed right at him
[48:37] and said that's the one that you gotta
[48:41] follow not me i must decrease
[48:45] that he may increase amen so it's always
[48:49] jesus christ listen a prophet never
[48:51] points you to his self
[48:52] if a prophet points you to himself he's
[48:54] not a true prophet
[48:57] and our prophet in the end time he never
[48:59] pointed his to himself
[49:00] ever he pointed to jesus christ
[49:04] and through his message through his
[49:06] shout through his voice
[49:08] through the message that we get in the
[49:09] end time i see christ
[49:13] as real and more real
[49:16] then they're going to see him over there
[49:19] through those two witnesses
[49:21] because i'm his bride
[49:25] i'm not just a chosen one i'm his bride
[49:29] i'm his intimate one i'm his one that he
[49:31] gives all of his love to
[49:33] right not that he doesn't love the other
[49:35] people that's okay
[49:37] but i i love all you but now jim's only
[49:39] ones going home with me today
[49:41] amen right so that had to
[49:45] stop here and
[49:48] the heart of the children what the
[49:51] children
[49:53] that had been turned to the new
[49:56] testament
[49:58] okay got it everybody got that now
[50:02] this prophet that had to come in the end
[50:04] time
[50:05] he had to turn a group of children
[50:08] back to fathers in other words from baby
[50:11] to maturity
[50:13] all right so from baby they started down
[50:16] here
[50:17] as full grown some 120 in the upper room
[50:20] but when it got up to right here
[50:22] at the pentecostal age it was
[50:24] pentecostal babies
[50:26] yes everybody speak in tongues
[50:30] everybody do this everybody got a song
[50:32] everybody got a list everybody got that
[50:35] well that's why that the prophet of god
[50:36] had to go to the pentecostals because
[50:38] they were children
[50:39] now listen they were in the family
[50:43] because they were children
[50:47] so don't do away with them they were
[50:50] children
[50:51] they were part of the family but they
[50:54] were babies
[50:56] and they couldn't grow anymore without
[50:58] god sending a prophet
[51:00] to turn them back as i was saying this
[51:02] morning that you've got this strand of
[51:05] eternity
[51:06] and the eternal word of god can't be
[51:07] changed but satan can come in and he can
[51:10] he can cut it and let it become
[51:13] non-effective because those loose ends
[51:15] are hanging down
[51:17] so god had to send a prophet in the end
[51:19] time because he's got to restore
[51:21] a prophet is a restorer
[51:24] like we talked about elijah this morning
[51:28] all right we'll cover in just a second
[51:29] we'll just kind of skim over it
[51:31] but a prophet's a restorer but a prophet
[51:33] also does something else if you reject
[51:35] his message what is it
[51:37] judgment right right that's right right
[51:41] just like this two like elijah there
[51:43] stood elijah
[51:44] with a woman and a baby a woman and a
[51:46] child
[51:48] and he said if you'll do what i say
[51:51] right right the woman that he meets when
[51:54] he goes down to
[51:56] after the god calls him out and tells
[51:57] him to go down to that city and they're
[51:59] having a three and a half year drought
[52:00] because he's the one that called for
[52:01] three and a half years of no rain
[52:03] right so he goes down in the middle of
[52:05] that chaos
[52:06] and he tells a woman top of the what
[52:08] church
[52:10] he says woman if you'll do what i say
[52:13] your crews will never run dry in other
[52:14] words you'll sustain yourself through
[52:16] this church age
[52:22] but now that's one woman right she did
[52:25] what he said
[52:28] i mean at the throes of death she did
[52:30] what he said she said i ain't got enough
[52:32] meal but just to make one little bitty
[52:33] cake me and my son's gonna die
[52:35] he said make it for me first
[52:38] make it for me first
[52:42] he said but thus saith the lord
[52:45] cruise will not run dry right and your
[52:48] meal barrel will never in other words
[52:50] when she dipped in that mill barrel
[52:51] and she dumped it over here she put the
[52:54] spoon back
[52:55] in there and it was level she'd reach
[52:58] and get it forever how many years that
[53:00] was
[53:00] it'd be level again it never went down
[53:03] where she had to scrape the barrel again
[53:05] why
[53:05] because she did what the prophet told
[53:07] her to do but now listen
[53:09] there's a woman that part of the church
[53:10] that elijah went to but now
[53:12] elijah went to another woman in the
[53:16] same region called jezebel
[53:19] she was jezebel's pastor whether she
[53:21] wanted to believe it or not
[53:23] because he was a god-sent prophet to
[53:26] that
[53:26] area he was her preacher right
[53:29] and he told her cause she was like i'm
[53:31] gonna kill you
[53:33] and elijah did what now did he have any
[53:36] grace for her
[53:38] no cause she turned it down he said the
[53:41] dogs will lick your blood
[53:42] yeah and they ate her up so much the
[53:45] only thing i didn't eat was the palm of
[53:46] her hands and something else
[53:48] but that was the two women or two
[53:51] churches so every time
[53:53] elijah came on the earth the spirit of
[53:55] elijah there was two women
[53:57] two types of the church that he had to
[54:00] deal with
[54:01] amen when brother branham came on earth
[54:03] there was a bride that needed to be
[54:05] taken into glory there was another bride
[54:07] that he said i indict you i indict you
[54:10] for
[54:10] killing jesus christ again and putting
[54:12] him on the cross because your
[54:13] denominational ideas amen
[54:17] so he didn't hate women he just hated
[54:19] the spirit that was on them
[54:21] same way with elijah all right so let's
[54:24] go to first kings real quick
[54:31] oh i'm sorry go to matthew 17. i'm sorry
[54:34] you're you're right
[54:35] let's read this right here because this
[54:36] is mount transfiguration listen we're
[54:38] going to come back to this because
[54:39] on mount transfiguration guess what
[54:41] happened
[54:42] you're looking at a prefigure of the
[54:45] rapture and the children of israel
[54:47] getting their message
[54:50] you got jesus and moses and elijah we're
[54:53] going to get back to that in a minute
[54:54] and his disciples asked him saying
[54:57] why then say the scribes that the lies
[54:59] must first come
[55:00] according to malachi 4.
[55:03] that's what they're saying the scribes
[55:07] and jesus said elijah truly shall first
[55:10] come and restore
[55:12] all things not just part not just not
[55:15] just turn back from a little one to a
[55:16] bit
[55:17] no he's going to restore all things what
[55:19] all those loose
[55:20] ends that have been untied and been cut
[55:23] and all those denominational ideas
[55:25] listen god can't be this confused to
[55:28] have 13 000 different ways to go to
[55:30] heaven
[55:31] that's right you say you got the only
[55:33] way
[55:34] jesus said i am the way.
[55:37] i'm not ways i am the way
[55:40] the truth and the life so there's only
[55:42] one way to get to heaven
[55:44] and that's the correct revelation of who
[55:46] jesus was and jesus answered the center
[55:48] of them he lies truly shall first come
[55:51] and restore all things so we know that
[55:52] that had to be not
[55:54] not the uh john the baptist because he
[55:56] didn't restore all things he introduced
[55:57] a messiah
[55:59] okay so it had to be the fourth coming
[56:01] of elijah to restore it in the end time
[56:04] according to put all the other
[56:05] scriptures together you got to take you
[56:06] can't just take one scripture you got to
[56:08] take all scriptures and put them
[56:09] together
[56:10] revelations 10 7 male 1 4 5 in kings no
[56:13] go back to kings
[56:15] we see that elijah this is number one
[56:17] elijah we were talking about this this
[56:19] morning we'll fly through it pretty
[56:20] quick
[56:21] and elijah said unto the prophets of
[56:22] baal now there's one elijah
[56:27] standing on top of mount carmel
[56:31] 400 preachers of baal
[56:35] right right 400
[56:40] remember how many wasn't one
[56:43] in a congregation we're standing on this
[56:46] mountain boy there must have been
[56:47] something going on
[56:49] there was a showdown folks there was a
[56:52] showdown between right and wrong
[56:55] the devil has always said if i can get
[56:57] enough enough numbers i can beat god
[57:02] god can take one right right amen
[57:06] gideon david all those different ones
[57:09] that the odds were so astronomical
[57:13] moses destroyed a nation as big as the
[57:16] united states of america through god god
[57:18] through him did
[57:19] so we're not worried about that you know
[57:20] what elijah wasn't either i believe you
[57:22] know he
[57:22] he probably had a vision the day before
[57:26] he probably had a vision today before
[57:28] and he knew all this was going to happen
[57:30] you can calmly walk into a battle when
[57:32] you know you've already won it
[57:34] so you say well what about us we've
[57:36] already known we won the battle
[57:39] we've already known death is not part of
[57:41] this we've already won the battle if
[57:43] you're born again
[57:45] great amen
[57:50] that's not going to take the taste of my
[57:52] mouth
[57:55] so elijah said unto the prophets of baal
[57:58] choose you one bullet for yourself and
[57:59] dress it first for year or many
[58:03] many of you 400 against one
[58:08] odds are insurmountable surely their god
[58:11] is going to show up
[58:14] surely your denominational idea is all
[58:16] right
[58:20] say then call on the name of your gods
[58:24] and put no fire under they took the
[58:27] bullet what's given them they dressed it
[58:28] called in the name of baal
[58:30] from morning until noon saying oh baal
[58:32] hear us
[58:33] but there was no voice what'd we say
[58:36] this morning according to amos there's a
[58:38] voice behind every prophet
[58:43] oh bail but there was no voice
[58:46] nor anything answered all you could hear
[58:48] was him screaming
[58:51] and they leaped upon the altar which was
[58:53] made and i'm sure they tore it down
[58:55] because elijah had to put it back
[58:56] together
[58:58] and it came to pass at noon that elijah
[58:59] mocked him and said cry loud for he's a
[59:01] god
[59:02] either he's talking or pursuing uh he's
[59:06] on vacation
[59:07] pre-adventure he's sleeping it must be
[59:09] awaken
[59:11] some of you the same way
[59:16] and they cried aloud and cut themself
[59:18] after their manner with knives and
[59:20] lances till the blood gushed out upon
[59:22] them it was not a good looking place
[59:26] and elijah's just standing over there
[59:31] he knew where he was standing and it
[59:34] came to pass when midday was passed that
[59:35] they prophesied at the time of the
[59:36] offering of the
[59:38] evening time that there was neither
[59:40] voice nor any
[59:41] answer nor any that regarded in other
[59:44] words they did all that in vain
[59:47] and elijah said unto all the people come
[59:49] near unto me and all the people came
[59:51] nearing him and he said
[59:52] and he repaired the altar or restored
[59:55] the altar of the lord that was broken
[59:57] down in other words
[59:58] he took 12 stones he took revelation and
[1:00:00] put the revelation back where it's
[1:00:01] supposed to be
[1:00:02] according to the number of the tribes of
[1:00:04] the sons of jacob remember he was in the
[1:00:05] old testament
[1:00:06] and with the stones he built an altar in
[1:00:08] the name of the lord and he made a
[1:00:09] trench about the altars greatest who
[1:00:11] contained two measures of seed
[1:00:13] and he put the wood in order he's
[1:00:15] putting everything back in order
[1:00:17] he's restoring worship because god's not
[1:00:20] gonna come with all that junk all over
[1:00:22] the place he got to restore worship
[1:00:25] and he cut the bullock in pieces and
[1:00:27] laid him on the wood and said fill four
[1:00:28] barrels of water and pour it on the
[1:00:29] burnt and sacrifice it on the wood
[1:00:31] he wanted to make sure this was going to
[1:00:32] be a miracle yeah
[1:00:34] right if it had been gasoline it had
[1:00:36] been a different story
[1:00:38] but water and he said do it the second
[1:00:42] time and they did it the second time and
[1:00:44] he said do it the third time and they
[1:00:45] did it the third time you know what we
[1:00:46] talked about this morning
[1:00:48] and the water ran everywhere and he
[1:00:50] filled the trench with water
[1:00:52] everything was soaking wet
[1:00:55] no way water could i mean a fire could
[1:00:58] do this
[1:01:00] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:01:01] offering of even sacrifice
[1:01:03] that's what i mean folks let me tell you
[1:01:04] something it looks like
[1:01:07] to the outside world that we can't do
[1:01:10] what we do
[1:01:14] it looks to the outside world like we
[1:01:16] just can't y'all just can't do what
[1:01:18] you're doing
[1:01:21] we're doing it how simple
[1:01:25] we're doing it and i'm happy about it
[1:01:28] i'm happy that the world thinks i'm
[1:01:29] different amen
[1:01:32] i didn't say crazy i said different okay
[1:01:35] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:01:37] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:01:38] elijah the prophet came near and said
[1:01:40] lord god of abraham isaac and israel
[1:01:42] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:01:44] god in israel
[1:01:46] and that i am thy servant look at that
[1:01:48] identification that i am thy servant
[1:01:52] and that i have done all these things
[1:01:54] after our word god had already told him
[1:01:56] that
[1:01:58] christ
[1:02:01] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:02:04] may know that thou art the lord god and
[1:02:06] that thou has turned their heart
[1:02:09] back again just the same as what
[1:02:11] happened in malachi
[1:02:13] 4. turn the heart back now we know the
[1:02:16] rest of the story now if you don't know
[1:02:18] the rest of the story you need to read
[1:02:19] your bible
[1:02:20] god came down and didn't just consume
[1:02:22] the sacrifice
[1:02:23] all the water was gone and then they
[1:02:26] took those 400 prophets and they took
[1:02:28] them down to the river kidron and they
[1:02:29] killed all 400 of them
[1:02:31] elijah was there with him why because
[1:02:34] the message of the
[1:02:35] hour is what kills those demons
[1:02:38] every demon you've got the message of
[1:02:40] the hour will kill it i promise you and
[1:02:42] you say with the message of the hour the
[1:02:43] message of the hours lord jesus christ
[1:02:47] through a prophet so there's the malachi
[1:02:49] 4. let's go to the next
[1:02:52] excuse me now this is where we had see
[1:02:55] the identification of the prophet in the
[1:02:57] end time
[1:02:58] now this message of malachi 4 in
[1:03:00] revelation 10 7 because
[1:03:01] what is revelations 10 7 but in the days
[1:03:05] of the voice of the seventh angel so
[1:03:06] there's got to be a seventh angel sound
[1:03:08] there's got to be a seventh messenger
[1:03:10] to sound to show and reveal the mystery
[1:03:16] of god all right
[1:03:19] malachi 4 we just read it it's going to
[1:03:21] do two things malachi 4 he'll turn the
[1:03:23] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:03:24] that's what we're talking about
[1:03:26] pentecostal babies right there you go
[1:03:29] all right go back up again
[1:03:31] thank you you're going to do according
[1:03:32] to malachi 4 he turned the hearts of the
[1:03:34] children what pentecostal babies
[1:03:37] to the faith of the established fathers
[1:03:39] peter james john
[1:03:42] all the old to all the old testament all
[1:03:44] the new testament
[1:03:45] the 120 in the upper room the ones that
[1:03:48] had the word of god
[1:03:49] peter james john the one that wrote the
[1:03:51] new testament bible
[1:03:55] what's the difference in when he came
[1:03:56] what's the difference in when william
[1:03:58] branham came on the earth and when they
[1:03:59] came on the earth
[1:04:00] there wasn't a baptist on this corner
[1:04:01] and a pentecostal in that corner and a
[1:04:03] methodist on that corner
[1:04:04] and a jewish on that corner and orthodox
[1:04:06] over here and then
[1:04:07] tunis and foreigners and oneness and
[1:04:10] job witness and seventh-day adventists
[1:04:13] and this just
[1:04:15] there wasn't that in the first church
[1:04:16] age there was fallacies there was little
[1:04:19] sayings but there wasn't those demons
[1:04:23] so as we have now when the prophet of
[1:04:25] god came on the scene
[1:04:28] he had to turn the hearts of the of the
[1:04:30] pentecostal babies
[1:04:31] to the faith of the fathers back to
[1:04:33] where
[1:04:35] listen just like i told you this morning
[1:04:37] no prophet
[1:04:40] ever told you that hell was eternal
[1:04:43] that's right it's not in the bible but
[1:04:46] you learned it from somewhere
[1:04:49] some man told you yeah
[1:04:52] right you didn't just come up with it on
[1:04:54] your own right
[1:04:56] some man had to tell you that right
[1:04:59] trinity not even in the bible no such
[1:05:01] thing
[1:05:02] a man told you that and you believed it
[1:05:05] before you came into the message
[1:05:08] right right some man stood up and told
[1:05:11] you that
[1:05:12] right now how confused is god
[1:05:16] he's one right right correct so satan
[1:05:20] had to feed you the three
[1:05:22] water baptism never was instituted in
[1:05:25] the new testament
[1:05:26] in the name of the father son holy ghost
[1:05:28] because father's not a name son is not a
[1:05:29] name and holy ghost is not a name
[1:05:31] right you sure i'll tell you what jesus
[1:05:34] said
[1:05:34] i'm just telling you what jesus said how
[1:05:37] could jesus tell you one thing and peter
[1:05:39] tells you something else and
[1:05:40] and you know jesus didn't even have the
[1:05:42] keys to the kingdom
[1:05:47] peter i give you
[1:05:50] the keys to the kingdom and whatever you
[1:05:53] bind on earth i'll bind in heaven
[1:05:55] whatever you loose on earth i'll loose
[1:05:57] it in heaven
[1:05:58] and is that not right and peter stands
[1:06:01] up on the day of pentecost
[1:06:02] and says repent every one of you and be
[1:06:04] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:06:06] of the son another
[1:06:11] if it had it would have clicked in
[1:06:13] heaven and it would have clicked on
[1:06:15] there
[1:06:17] he said repent every one of you and i
[1:06:19] know what jesus was saying because
[1:06:21] father's not a name son is not a name
[1:06:25] holy ghost is not a name there's only
[1:06:28] one name under heaven whereby
[1:06:29] men should be saved and that's the name
[1:06:32] of jesus christ
[1:06:34] and nowhere in the bible until the
[1:06:36] catholic church got a hold of it at
[1:06:38] about 300 or 600 a.d somewhere in there
[1:06:41] no one was ever baptized in the name of
[1:06:42] the father and the son the holy ghost
[1:06:44] because it wasn't true
[1:06:46] but but
[1:06:49] somebody stood up and told you that and
[1:06:52] you took it as what
[1:06:53] bible yeah is that not correct
[1:06:58] i know some of you i i i didn't come
[1:07:01] from that but some of you came from a
[1:07:02] trinitarian background and all these
[1:07:03] different things
[1:07:04] brother boyd came from a catholic
[1:07:06] background so did luis come from
[1:07:08] catholic
[1:07:09] or no methodist and a catholic
[1:07:10] background you were taught these things
[1:07:12] by a man
[1:07:14] but not a prophet that's why god had to
[1:07:17] send us a prophet
[1:07:19] to turn us back because if they didn't
[1:07:22] baptize in the name of father and son
[1:07:24] holy ghost in the new testament in the
[1:07:26] early stages of the faith of the fathers
[1:07:29] where did it go wrong through the church
[1:07:32] ages
[1:07:32] satan got involved and started not
[1:07:36] erratic
[1:07:36] you can't eradicate the word of god but
[1:07:38] you can make it of none effect didn't
[1:07:39] jesus say you've made it by your
[1:07:41] traditions
[1:07:42] you've made the word of god in none
[1:07:43] effect to the people
[1:07:45] but god winked at their ignorance but
[1:07:47] when we come to the end time where we're
[1:07:48] going to have to
[1:07:49] be in a resurrection we're going to have
[1:07:51] to be in a we're going to have to call
[1:07:53] the dead saints out of the ground
[1:07:54] listen jesus didn't stand and call
[1:07:56] lazarus out of the ground with a
[1:07:57] trinitarian idea
[1:08:00] i said idea because it's not a doctrine
[1:08:03] jesus wasn't standing there and said
[1:08:04] well i know hell's eternal but i'm going
[1:08:06] to bring lazarus out
[1:08:07] no he was the word of god
[1:08:10] amen and being the correct word of god
[1:08:13] he said
[1:08:14] i am the resurrection right amen
[1:08:18] lazarus come forth in other words there
[1:08:21] was no
[1:08:22] there was no black spots there was no
[1:08:24] gaps
[1:08:25] there was no false doctrine coming from
[1:08:28] that man
[1:08:28] and then i believe i didn't the prophet
[1:08:30] of god tell us that where's the
[1:08:31] resurrection it lies
[1:08:33] in you the resurrection lies in you the
[1:08:37] voice of the resurrection will not be
[1:08:40] right right right voice
[1:08:45] and it won't be lazarus this time
[1:08:49] come on he'll be richard marlowe
[1:08:55] it'll be your dad it'll be
[1:08:58] your husband your son
[1:09:02] that's who we're going to be calling hey
[1:09:04] man amen
[1:09:06] where's he gonna come from though
[1:09:08] falsehood
[1:09:10] that's why the son of man folks that's
[1:09:12] why it's so important to realize
[1:09:14] that we're under the son of man ministry
[1:09:15] we're not under the sun god ministry
[1:09:17] under the son of god ministry
[1:09:18] there can be places now god's never
[1:09:20] wrong but he winks at the ignorance down
[1:09:23] to the church ages because man has stood
[1:09:24] in the pulpit and told you all these
[1:09:26] things were okay
[1:09:28] right why i'm going with marriage and
[1:09:32] divorce
[1:09:32] we're not gonna talk about that right
[1:09:35] right
[1:09:35] okay but all the other major doctrines a
[1:09:39] man had to stand back here and tell you
[1:09:41] and if it wasn't according to the word
[1:09:42] of god it wasn't god that told you
[1:09:45] amen it was the devil
[1:09:49] because god is not false and he can't be
[1:09:52] deceived but you and i can but
[1:09:56] then he sends us a prophet in the end
[1:09:57] time to turn us back to the faith of the
[1:09:59] fathers
[1:10:00] put us back into the new testament where
[1:10:03] we baptize correct in the name of the
[1:10:05] lord jesus christ
[1:10:06] well we know there's no eternal hell
[1:10:08] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:10:09] life and if
[1:10:10] if hell was eternal god would have to be
[1:10:12] there the whole time that's right amen
[1:10:14] amen
[1:10:17] and a trinity
[1:10:21] behold o israel the lord thy god is
[1:10:25] three
[1:10:28] what'd i say three one
[1:10:32] there's only one god amen and jesus
[1:10:35] christ is his name
[1:10:39] i and my father are one they really kind
[1:10:41] of stumble over that it's kind of pretty
[1:10:43] much
[1:10:44] school teacher english i and my father
[1:10:47] are one were they
[1:10:50] but see they had to cut him apart so
[1:10:52] that god could send us a profit though
[1:10:54] listen if everything was all hunky-dory
[1:10:56] and we had the faith of the fathers and
[1:10:58] we were
[1:10:59] peter james and john was in our
[1:11:00] congregation doing our preaching for us
[1:11:02] we wouldn't need a prophet we need a
[1:11:05] prophet
[1:11:06] needed a prophet to restore us back to
[1:11:08] that so god said i'll do nothing
[1:11:12] unless i reveal it to my servants the
[1:11:14] prophets first
[1:11:16] and then i'm going to bring it to you
[1:11:18] amen amen
[1:11:20] everybody okay with this amen right so
[1:11:22] that was the importance of god
[1:11:23] sending a messenger sure he sent
[1:11:27] luther wesley he sent the the
[1:11:30] dowies he sent the uh you're a smith he
[1:11:33] sent all that and we
[1:11:35] we honor those people but they weren't
[1:11:37] identified in the bible as
[1:11:40] our prophet in the end time was
[1:11:41] identified in the bible
[1:11:43] he was identified truly as elijah he
[1:11:45] loved the wilderness he hated
[1:11:46] bad women all the different things he
[1:11:48] was absolutely
[1:11:50] the last the messenger of the end time
[1:11:55] he wasn't god because he was sex born
[1:11:59] so that just negated all that okay so
[1:12:02] you can get that out of your head we
[1:12:04] know that
[1:12:05] we don't believe that but let's continue
[1:12:09] let's skip a few right here
[1:12:11] let's go to where it says based on
[1:12:12] resurrection
[1:12:14] because in the end time well let's go to
[1:12:16] number three the queen of sheba
[1:12:18] now here we see in the end time we
[1:12:22] see a lot of people that we see people
[1:12:24] that had messages
[1:12:25] moody calvin knox finney
[1:12:29] all the different great ones spurgeon
[1:12:34] um what's the one that
[1:12:39] wigglesworth smith wigglesworth man i
[1:12:42] mean smith wigglesworth
[1:12:44] read his book i mean
[1:12:48] come on he goes into a shoe store
[1:12:51] and the boy don't even have any feet
[1:12:55] and he asked him what size shoe do you
[1:12:57] want
[1:12:59] and what color do you want and they said
[1:13:02] they said by testimony that the boy's
[1:13:05] feet when the man pulled the shoes out
[1:13:07] the boy's feet grew down into the shoe
[1:13:10] you say well that's just impossible
[1:13:14] come on little girl
[1:13:18] little girl what color eyes do you want
[1:13:21] oh i forgot
[1:13:24] remember the little girl she comes up to
[1:13:26] the prophet and she has no eyeballs
[1:13:28] right none right
[1:13:31] he says he pulls her to his bosom and he
[1:13:33] prays for it and
[1:13:34] he said he let her go and said oh i
[1:13:36] forgot what color eyes do you want
[1:13:39] amen oh what a mighty god we serve
[1:13:44] but see that's the sign that this
[1:13:46] generation got
[1:13:48] look down here in this generation what
[1:13:50] he's doing now they'll receive a sign
[1:13:52] but they won't believe it
[1:13:56] continue reading there you are but it
[1:13:58] came just the same and even an
[1:13:59] adulterous generation will seek after a
[1:14:01] sign
[1:14:02] and they'll have it it'll be given to
[1:14:04] them as jonah was in the belly of the
[1:14:06] well
[1:14:07] three days and night so the son of man
[1:14:09] will be in the heart of the earth we
[1:14:10] know that was
[1:14:11] jesus christ when he died and then he
[1:14:12] resurrected but the resurrection will be
[1:14:15] the sign
[1:14:17] and the resurrection a sign is given to
[1:14:19] the church in this last day
[1:14:24] like i said before this morning no man
[1:14:29] since the lord jesus christ ever stood
[1:14:33] and could point his finger and say you
[1:14:36] were at the doctor yesterday
[1:14:38] you had on a blue suit with a red ribbon
[1:14:41] in your hair
[1:14:42] you had on purple shoes i mean he was
[1:14:44] down to the detail down to the detail
[1:14:47] you live in house number 2334 on a
[1:14:49] certain certain street
[1:14:50] the doctor told you you have cancer it's
[1:14:52] on your left breast
[1:14:54] he said you're shadowed with death he
[1:14:56] prayed a prayer and he said okay the
[1:14:58] shadows left you lady you're healed
[1:15:01] nobody could do that
[1:15:02] right thousands upon thousands upon
[1:15:05] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1:15:07] of times
[1:15:09] went to india and 250 000 people were
[1:15:13] confirmed healed in one service
[1:15:16] they had to carry stretchers and
[1:15:19] wheelchairs he said he looked out the
[1:15:21] window and they were bringing them
[1:15:23] and those car carriers that carried the
[1:15:25] military
[1:15:26] piled full of stretchers
[1:15:29] there was our but listen that was a
[1:15:31] temporary resurrection sign
[1:15:35] everybody got that the dead was raised
[1:15:38] the sick was healed
[1:15:40] under the prophet of god but remember
[1:15:44] it's in the days of the voice
[1:15:47] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:15:50] to sound
[1:15:52] the mystery that the resurrection
[1:15:56] can come from me in you
[1:16:00] the resurrection will be the sign the
[1:16:02] resurrection is signed as
[1:16:04] sign is given to the church in the last
[1:16:06] days
[1:16:07] remember the prophet of god told us he
[1:16:08] said what you see in its infancy
[1:16:12] my goodness are in part
[1:16:16] he said you'll see in the fullness at
[1:16:18] the end time oh my
[1:16:22] i mean good grief there'd be hundreds of
[1:16:23] people healed every night
[1:16:25] in service and that was just a part
[1:16:29] a piece well it was given to one man
[1:16:33] see it was given to one man now it's
[1:16:35] given to me and you it's given to me and
[1:16:37] you john revelation
[1:16:39] 10 8 to prophesy all right
[1:16:42] and the angel of the holy spirit in the
[1:16:44] meetings showing the same thing doing
[1:16:45] the same thing across the nation
[1:16:48] proving that jesus christ was raised
[1:16:49] from the dead just the same yesterday
[1:16:50] today and forever
[1:16:52] that's the generation that will receive
[1:16:53] it in other words
[1:16:55] they received the sign and turned it
[1:16:57] down
[1:16:59] because they looked at the healing
[1:17:00] campaign more than they looked at the
[1:17:02] message
[1:17:04] but now you and i are the generation
[1:17:07] that say yes we saw the signs that we
[1:17:09] saw we hear the prayer line
[1:17:11] we saw the signs and wonder some of you
[1:17:12] were sitting here in the building
[1:17:14] that was there sister tootsie sister
[1:17:16] cleta
[1:17:18] sister freda were sitting in the service
[1:17:20] and we had several others that had
[1:17:22] passed on brother joe canada's daddy
[1:17:24] brother robert tatum and several ones
[1:17:26] that were in actually in the meetings
[1:17:27] and saw the
[1:17:29] saw god heal people your daddy was
[1:17:32] called out in a prayer line wasn't he
[1:17:34] that's right mr duncan sure was called
[1:17:36] out in a prayer line
[1:17:38] all right so you see that it wasn't a
[1:17:40] fallacy
[1:17:42] it happened but remember they got hung
[1:17:45] on the
[1:17:47] signs and wonders because that's a
[1:17:50] temporary resurrection sign
[1:17:52] the resurrection sign is over here in
[1:17:54] the message of the hour
[1:17:56] where we're standing today this
[1:17:57] generation that takes the voice of god
[1:17:59] and prophesies
[1:18:00] and the dead in christ shall rise
[1:18:04] listen it's not going to be an angel
[1:18:05] come down from heaven stand here and go
[1:18:09] and the resurrection it's going to
[1:18:12] happen through us
[1:18:14] we're going to have so much faith in the
[1:18:16] lord
[1:18:18] amen but it's going to be just still
[1:18:19] baby faith
[1:18:21] faith is faith that's the generation
[1:18:24] that we're receiving let's go to the
[1:18:26] next one
[1:18:27] everybody all right
[1:18:31] everything christianity is based on
[1:18:33] resurrection if jesus christ didn't
[1:18:35] raise from the dead then there's no
[1:18:36] christianity
[1:18:38] because what are we believing mohammed
[1:18:41] is still in the grave
[1:18:42] but they sure believe he was a prophet
[1:18:44] but they believe he's going to resurrect
[1:18:47] we don't have to wait ours has already
[1:18:51] risen
[1:18:52] and we didn't have to have a white horse
[1:18:54] sitting there waiting on him when he got
[1:18:55] out of the tomb
[1:18:58] buddha airplane buddha
[1:19:04] waiting on in the river act right we're
[1:19:06] not waiting on hours to resurrect
[1:19:09] he's already given us the resurrection
[1:19:10] sign he gave us a resurrection signed
[1:19:12] through the prophet of god
[1:19:14] resurrection is a state of having passed
[1:19:16] completely through death and having
[1:19:17] risen from death
[1:19:18] to be in resurrection is different than
[1:19:20] to be alive obviously
[1:19:22] to be alive is the original state
[1:19:24] without having passed through death
[1:19:26] now listen we're going to read in a
[1:19:27] minute that those who are
[1:19:30] alive and remain
[1:19:33] so there is a group this is going to be
[1:19:38] the ones that do the calling
[1:19:42] to be alive is the original state
[1:19:44] without having passed through death
[1:19:45] to be in resurrection is to have passed
[1:19:48] through death
[1:19:49] and have been raised up and like i said
[1:19:50] this morning jesus went through
[1:19:52] death burial resurrection but he didn't
[1:19:54] die again
[1:19:55] lazarus died again all the people that
[1:19:57] brother branham not brother brethren but
[1:19:59] god threw the prophet of god raised from
[1:20:00] the dead
[1:20:01] they all passed on right yeah so that
[1:20:04] was temporary resurrection listen when
[1:20:06] you get healed
[1:20:07] it's a temporary resurrection amen
[1:20:11] you sure feel better when god heals you
[1:20:12] don't you well that's a temporary
[1:20:14] resurrection but then all of a sudden
[1:20:16] the next day your other leg hurts yeah
[1:20:19] right sister leaves you your other leg
[1:20:21] hurts and then your other arm hurts and
[1:20:23] go
[1:20:23] god heal me this headache well that's
[1:20:25] good well
[1:20:27] you see what i mean it's temporary but
[1:20:29] we're coming to a place to where it's
[1:20:31] full
[1:20:33] the full resurrection is going to take
[1:20:34] place
[1:20:36] to be in resurrections have passed
[1:20:38] through death to have been raised up
[1:20:40] now remember you got to take the
[1:20:41] scriptures in the bible it says we're
[1:20:43] already resurrected
[1:20:46] sitting in heavenly places i believe
[1:20:48] it's my colossians or somewhere in there
[1:20:50] raised up sitting in heavenly places but
[1:20:53] that's the soul
[1:20:54] that's right not the body amen
[1:20:57] but jesus resurrected in a body he
[1:21:00] resurrected in the body he died in
[1:21:04] what a miracle and we'll resurrect
[1:21:08] anybody we went down in it'll just be
[1:21:10] made
[1:21:11] new right amen
[1:21:15] and then it will be a new body but now
[1:21:17] some people preach it'll be a new body
[1:21:19] where
[1:21:19] you just throw this one away no listen
[1:21:21] i'm connected to this guy
[1:21:24] so are you and most denominations they
[1:21:26] believe that this thing's going to just
[1:21:27] stay in the grave
[1:21:32] and you're just going to get this
[1:21:33] brand-new something over here
[1:21:36] no that's not resurrection we're talking
[1:21:39] about resurrection
[1:21:40] resurrection is if i drop this down and
[1:21:43] if i pick this up
[1:21:45] i am resurrecting that piece of paper if
[1:21:48] i put this bottle down
[1:21:50] and then pick this piece of paper up
[1:21:52] that's not resurrection
[1:21:54] that's replacement
[1:21:58] it's going to be a miracle to god change
[1:22:01] this thing right here
[1:22:03] it's not a miracle if he just goes and
[1:22:04] gets him another one out of a closet and
[1:22:06] just sticks it on you
[1:22:09] right am i right am i right
[1:22:12] that's the miracle that this could come
[1:22:14] what born in sin
[1:22:16] shaping and iniquity see that's what the
[1:22:17] world in their mind they say
[1:22:19] i'm so sinful i'm not good and you're
[1:22:21] not good
[1:22:24] ain't perfect you ain't either that's
[1:22:25] not what god said
[1:22:28] right come on yes god said be there for
[1:22:31] perfect
[1:22:33] even as my father in heaven is perfect
[1:22:36] and if i'm in him i'm perfect in him
[1:22:40] so i'm going to come up and be
[1:22:41] resurrected in this body if i have to go
[1:22:43] by the grave
[1:22:44] this body and then it's just going to be
[1:22:45] changed into new.
[1:22:48] amen you be careful with your
[1:22:50] replacement and your resurrection
[1:22:54] when the prophet of god says new body he
[1:22:56] is not meaning new as in
[1:22:57] listen let me give you a little because
[1:23:00] it was brought to my attention that
[1:23:02] brother brown said
[1:23:04] that you get in your body you got to
[1:23:07] continue on with the puzzle
[1:23:09] go to the future home i'm telling you if
[1:23:12] you have a problem with any of the
[1:23:14] resurrection
[1:23:15] new body justification that's why i love
[1:23:18] that
[1:23:20] that sermon the future home he covers
[1:23:22] all that
[1:23:23] so now what does he tell us about the
[1:23:24] earth aren't you connected to the earth
[1:23:28] well donnie we're not going to get two
[1:23:29] wins
[1:23:31] is that okay aren't you connect didn't
[1:23:34] you come out of this earth
[1:23:36] didn't your body 16 elements your dad
[1:23:38] ate your mama ate they come together
[1:23:40] you came and got a body with 16 elements
[1:23:42] right and where'd it come from not outer
[1:23:44] space
[1:23:45] it came from the earth so you're
[1:23:47] connected to this earth
[1:23:49] now the bible tells us that heaven and
[1:23:51] earth will pass away
[1:23:54] then there i believe it in peter or
[1:23:56] somewhere it says we'll be we'll
[1:23:57] we'll pass away with a great noise so
[1:24:00] see everybody thinks that the unite that
[1:24:02] the whole world's just going to blow up
[1:24:04] and god's going to make a new one but
[1:24:06] remember it took a prophet to god
[1:24:08] to tell us that word is anonym or
[1:24:11] whatever that long word is
[1:24:14] and it does not mean annihilation
[1:24:18] it just means clean it off that's right
[1:24:22] so that's what he's going to do with
[1:24:23] your body because you're connected to
[1:24:26] this earth if he's not going to destroy
[1:24:27] this earth he's not going to destroy
[1:24:29] this earth
[1:24:33] but see it's hard to believe when you
[1:24:34] get up in the morning that i'm saying
[1:24:36] what i'm saying
[1:24:37] you know what i'm saying
[1:24:41] right brother paul yeah
[1:24:44] we get up and get up in shifts and you
[1:24:47] try to get your feet up first and
[1:24:49] you'll understand later on that's why
[1:24:52] we're going to be turned back to them 20
[1:24:54] year old kids they're going
[1:24:55] what's he talking about i just jump up
[1:24:57] out of the bed whatever time and i
[1:24:59] you know my shoes are already on before
[1:25:00] i hit the floor
[1:25:05] i got to get to the floor first and it
[1:25:07] might be my face first
[1:25:11] right right because i'm what born in sin
[1:25:14] i've got
[1:25:14] i'm getting older but this thing's going
[1:25:17] to be
[1:25:18] changed back to that 20 year old person
[1:25:20] i was
[1:25:21] because remember god took a picture of
[1:25:22] you
[1:25:24] when you were that age and he's going to
[1:25:26] ship you right back to that age
[1:25:28] he's not going to annihilate the world
[1:25:29] listen the bible tells us we're going to
[1:25:31] live right here
[1:25:33] this is where we're living this is our
[1:25:35] heaven
[1:25:38] john saw the new city coming down out of
[1:25:41] heaven
[1:25:42] settling onto the earth
[1:25:46] this is where we're going to live folks
[1:25:47] and it's going to be a redeemed earth
[1:25:49] it's going to be a earth that's been
[1:25:51] washed
[1:25:52] that's been burnt by fire that's been
[1:25:54] renovated
[1:25:56] sin has been annihilated same way as
[1:25:59] when the dead saints come out of the
[1:26:00] ground
[1:26:01] they're going to step in this dimension
[1:26:02] and boom
[1:26:05] 20 years old amen oh what are you what
[1:26:08] are youth meeting we're gonna have
[1:26:09] right it will never end either
[1:26:13] to be resurrectionists have passed
[1:26:14] through death and they've been raised up
[1:26:16] let's go to the next one
[1:26:18] we haven't even got where he was this
[1:26:20] morning
[1:26:23] i like these little refresher courses
[1:26:24] though it kind of helps everybody out a
[1:26:25] little bit amen
[1:26:28] now if christ be preached that he rose
[1:26:29] from the dead i'll say some among you
[1:26:32] that there's no resurrection of the dead
[1:26:35] but if there be no resurrection of the
[1:26:37] dead then is christ not risen
[1:26:38] and if christ be not risen then is our
[1:26:41] preaching vein and your faith also
[1:26:43] vain and i'll ask you another question
[1:26:45] when jesus resurrected
[1:26:47] because remember he's the first fruit
[1:26:49] right first fruits of the resurrection
[1:26:51] he's the first one
[1:26:52] that came out of the ground and he never
[1:26:54] has to go back into the ground again is
[1:26:55] everybody right with that
[1:26:57] right first fruits of the resurrection
[1:26:59] so whatever whatever
[1:27:01] listen first fruit if if the first thing
[1:27:03] comes to maturity is corn
[1:27:05] and it came out of a corn field what's
[1:27:08] the rest of the crop
[1:27:09] corn hello corn
[1:27:13] so whatever happened to this first fruit
[1:27:16] is going to happen to the rest
[1:27:18] all right all right so is there an empty
[1:27:20] tomb or is there a tomb with a body
[1:27:22] laying in it
[1:27:25] there's an empty tomb so in your
[1:27:28] resurrection
[1:27:30] hey that's going to be an empty tomb
[1:27:35] right and you're not going to have to
[1:27:37] dig your way out
[1:27:39] that's the great mystery
[1:27:42] your mama taught you can't tell that
[1:27:45] your mama and your grandma taught you
[1:27:46] that one day you're gonna walk out there
[1:27:48] and them graves are gonna just pop right
[1:27:50] open
[1:27:50] and there's gonna be dirt laying
[1:27:52] everywhere
[1:27:54] no remember this is secret
[1:27:58] catching away secret catching away
[1:28:02] they'll never be there where you have to
[1:28:08] listen our first fruits jesus christ
[1:28:12] when he came back on earth right
[1:28:16] the bible said basically he walked
[1:28:19] through a wall
[1:28:21] remember they were in the upper chambers
[1:28:22] they had all the doors locked they had
[1:28:24] all the windows closed
[1:28:25] and he appeared among them
[1:28:28] in a flesh body not a spirit
[1:28:32] because they were saying that he
[1:28:33] perceived that in their mind
[1:28:35] he said give me some fish and then i bet
[1:28:39] you old toddlers because he's a little
[1:28:40] bit down in thomas he said i bet that
[1:28:42] fish is going to hit the floor
[1:28:45] because the spirit can't eat i bet he's
[1:28:46] going to put it in it's going to go
[1:28:50] no he was a human he had turned back
[1:28:54] to a young man that's why they didn't
[1:28:56] realize who he was number one number two
[1:28:58] he ate that fish and it went right down
[1:29:01] inside of him
[1:29:03] but then again when he left he just went
[1:29:06] right through the wall again
[1:29:09] what about that that's what a glorified
[1:29:12] body
[1:29:12] will do for you mine and yours is not
[1:29:15] glorified yet
[1:29:18] i got to go open that door to get
[1:29:19] outside but if there be no resurrection
[1:29:22] of the dead
[1:29:23] see that's why i've been trying to try
[1:29:25] to mold in my mind
[1:29:27] i told you about the son of man if we
[1:29:29] take the character of what jesus
[1:29:31] was on earth he was the son of man
[1:29:34] if we're supposed to have the son of man
[1:29:36] ministry back here in the end time
[1:29:38] the same as that according to luke 17
[1:29:41] 30.
[1:29:43] then we always take this character of
[1:29:45] this man
[1:29:47] and bring it over here and say all right
[1:29:49] where am i missing it
[1:29:50] right now i know between there and here
[1:29:52] there's a virgin birth that i can't ex
[1:29:55] that i can't get over i
[1:29:58] i didn't come that way but i'm not
[1:30:00] almighty god i'm part of almighty god
[1:30:04] he was born virgin birth i wasn't but he
[1:30:07] he
[1:30:07] basically told me he said if you believe
[1:30:09] in me so i'll do away with that
[1:30:14] by your new birth that's why i told
[1:30:15] nicodemus he said nicodemus you must be
[1:30:17] born again
[1:30:19] and nicodemus said what have i got to go
[1:30:22] get back in my mama's womb
[1:30:24] and be born jesus said no
[1:30:29] that's your problem yeah if you go back
[1:30:32] do again you're double in trouble
[1:30:36] he said you got to be born from above
[1:30:39] then you want when you're born from
[1:30:40] above
[1:30:40] sure you're going to have problems sure
[1:30:42] you're going to have heartache sure
[1:30:43] you're going to have trial sure you're
[1:30:44] always going to have a characteristic of
[1:30:45] the person that birthed you
[1:30:47] but you can be born again
[1:30:52] by jesus christ and you act different
[1:30:55] you can't have an excuse that well i got
[1:30:57] to be this way because my mom and dad is
[1:30:59] this way
[1:31:01] you know what i want to be the way that
[1:31:03] my mom and daddy is
[1:31:05] right the bible tells him that tells me
[1:31:08] that my mother is new jerusalem
[1:31:10] which is the mother of a saul and i know
[1:31:11] who my father is too
[1:31:14] so that's what we need to act like
[1:31:16] because he's to do we have that genetics
[1:31:18] inside
[1:31:19] that's going to that's what's going to
[1:31:20] change us to the outside or we'll get to
[1:31:22] that later
[1:31:23] but if there'd be no resurrection of the
[1:31:25] dead then this christ is not risen and
[1:31:26] if christ be not risen
[1:31:27] then does our preaching and vain and
[1:31:29] your faith also in vain let's go to the
[1:31:30] next one
[1:31:32] revelation 20 verse 4. here's what we're
[1:31:34] talking about this morning
[1:31:35] and i saw thrones not one throne thrones
[1:31:39] and they sat upon them they many people
[1:31:43] the bride me and you we don't stand in
[1:31:47] judgment
[1:31:48] amen and judgment was
[1:31:51] given unto them
[1:31:55] to judge the world the bible says the
[1:31:58] saints will judge
[1:31:59] the earth we'll even judge angels
[1:32:04] and we're not worthy i'm going to say
[1:32:07] i'm worthy because he said i'm worthy
[1:32:10] and i saw the souls of them were
[1:32:12] beheaded for the witness of jesus for
[1:32:13] the word of god
[1:32:15] which had not worshiped the beast now
[1:32:16] look i didn't stop that this morning if
[1:32:18] i'm gonna stop right here
[1:32:19] we'll cover it when we get to the two
[1:32:20] witnesses the whole world
[1:32:24] when we leave this place the whole world
[1:32:29] world seven billion people are going to
[1:32:32] worship the beast
[1:32:35] and in the denomination worlds you're
[1:32:37] already worshiping if you're out there
[1:32:40] hello the and her daughters
[1:32:45] i'm just reading the bible which had not
[1:32:48] worshipped the beast so it couldn't be
[1:32:50] though it has to be bride neither his
[1:32:51] image
[1:32:52] neither had received his mark remember
[1:32:57] bless her heart diana diana the other
[1:32:59] day she's trying to
[1:33:01] she's trying to live better just pray
[1:33:04] for her my granddaughter
[1:33:06] she's trying to wear dresses and not cut
[1:33:08] her hair and
[1:33:09] and just pray for her um
[1:33:13] but she said papa she said somebody told
[1:33:16] me that
[1:33:17] uh if you had a tattoo
[1:33:21] that you're going to hell
[1:33:25] well i thought okay but where's that
[1:33:28] coming from i always try to look and see
[1:33:29] where that comes from
[1:33:31] not just to because a kid will process
[1:33:34] things
[1:33:34] somebody like me and freda we just say
[1:33:36] what we're thinking and
[1:33:38] then we have to apologize for it but
[1:33:41] i ain't wrong i know that no no longer
[1:33:44] than you have buddy
[1:33:46] so but a child though analyzes something
[1:33:50] and something has to spark that
[1:33:52] interest to ask that question everybody
[1:33:54] write with me young kids
[1:33:56] it sparks a question because something
[1:33:58] happens
[1:33:59] all right so she said pablo is it
[1:34:03] true that people this is it true that
[1:34:06] people are going to go to hell because
[1:34:07] they
[1:34:08] have a tattoo i said no
[1:34:12] because i was thinking i thought well
[1:34:14] you know what
[1:34:15] there's a movie a long time ago called
[1:34:17] the omen don't ever look it up
[1:34:20] this was bc before christ
[1:34:24] but it talks about the antichrist and
[1:34:25] what it was there was a 666 tattoo
[1:34:28] in a little boy's head and he was
[1:34:30] supposed to be the antichrist and they
[1:34:31] were going to try to kill him
[1:34:32] they found the 666 and then that's what
[1:34:34] deanna was asking
[1:34:36] about the stamp or the tattoo or the
[1:34:38] mark
[1:34:39] that's why we talked about the mark upon
[1:34:40] their forehead listen folks
[1:34:43] the world is so uh amorized with
[1:34:47] with vision they got to see this
[1:34:51] listen with god everything's secret
[1:34:53] unless you're part of the secret
[1:34:56] i like that one more time unless you're
[1:34:58] part of the secret it's secret
[1:35:01] but if you're part of the secret it's
[1:35:02] not secret anymore there's not going to
[1:35:04] be a 666 tattooed to your forehead
[1:35:07] that's where she was coming from i said
[1:35:09] no baby i said there's people in our
[1:35:10] church that have tattoos
[1:35:12] i said your dad's even got one i said
[1:35:14] but now the bible does tell us
[1:35:16] in leviticus i think it is that you
[1:35:17] don't shouldn't put ink in your body
[1:35:19] so there is a scripture that tells you
[1:35:22] you don't need to
[1:35:23] put needles or ink in your body so don't
[1:35:25] get a tattoo
[1:35:27] but where her thought process was not
[1:35:29] exactly that was
[1:35:30] was coming from that that was the mark
[1:35:33] of the beast if you were tattooed
[1:35:35] that that was the mark of the beast well
[1:35:37] that's not what this is happening
[1:35:39] there is nobody gonna no government
[1:35:42] gonna come up and say all right well
[1:35:43] we're gonna
[1:35:45] or in the forehead or something where
[1:35:47] people can see
[1:35:48] listen if you have an idea contrary to
[1:35:50] the word of god you're already tattooed
[1:35:55] you already got the mark
[1:35:58] now god can erase that mark he can take
[1:36:01] that tattoo off
[1:36:03] but if you don't take it off then where
[1:36:06] why is it say forehead
[1:36:08] in your intelligence it didn't say
[1:36:11] your foot or your leg it said right here
[1:36:13] and in your hand
[1:36:14] what your works and your brain
[1:36:18] that's where they want you they want you
[1:36:20] work work work work work work work
[1:36:23] and then have a different thought than
[1:36:24] what god has given us
[1:36:27] that's the tattoo that's the mark of the
[1:36:29] beast and so
[1:36:30] it's not neither had they received his
[1:36:32] mark upon their forehead
[1:36:34] or in their hands and they lived and
[1:36:37] reigned with christ
[1:36:38] one thousand years but the rest of the
[1:36:41] dead lived not again until the thousand
[1:36:42] years were finished in other words all
[1:36:44] those people
[1:36:45] that took the mark of the beast which
[1:36:48] the mark of the beast is
[1:36:49] unbelief folks it's not a mark a
[1:36:51] physical mark
[1:36:52] it's not a bar code lord of mercy when
[1:36:55] the bar codes came out
[1:36:56] oh grief everybody went to check in to
[1:37:00] see if
[1:37:00] the government came by one night black
[1:37:03] helicopter and
[1:37:05] we walk by and go
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:08] i like to mess with them girls when they
[1:37:10] you know when you go across
[1:37:12] they'll get ready and i'll go that'll
[1:37:15] mess them up real good
[1:37:17] but anyway they all listen didn't they
[1:37:19] didn't people think
[1:37:21] yeah we laugh but there's everybody's
[1:37:23] like what's the mark of the beast
[1:37:25] and then now they give you the now
[1:37:27] they're gonna give you the vaccine and
[1:37:28] that's the mark of the beast
[1:37:30] not knowing they're already
[1:37:32] participating in the mark of the beast
[1:37:35] by not having the correct word of god
[1:37:38] in their heart heart and then they got
[1:37:40] to get it here first
[1:37:41] everybody okay with this i'm about to
[1:37:44] run out of voice
[1:37:46] but this is the first resurrection
[1:37:49] that's the secret one that's the one
[1:37:52] nobody's gonna know anything about
[1:37:54] right that's the secret catching away
[1:37:57] that's the no graves have to be open we
[1:38:00] just disappear
[1:38:03] because the second resurrection
[1:38:07] second death is up you under where
[1:38:10] there's thrones
[1:38:11] and then the bible tells us their book
[1:38:13] is open
[1:38:16] and out of that book will be judged the
[1:38:18] people of the earth
[1:38:20] not me and you not the born-again
[1:38:22] believers of course look
[1:38:23] blessed and holy it's he that has part
[1:38:26] in the first resurrection in other words
[1:38:28] born-again believers come up in the
[1:38:30] first resurrection no one else
[1:38:33] everybody got that same man no one else
[1:38:36] there's no foolish virgin there's no one
[1:38:37] cup of water in my name
[1:38:38] there's no justified people there's no
[1:38:41] listen this is a hard one there's no um
[1:38:44] little children that die before the
[1:38:46] because they're not born again
[1:38:48] only born-again people come up in the
[1:38:50] first resurrection
[1:38:51] that have the new birth in their soul
[1:38:53] under their messenger whoever it be paul
[1:38:55] irenaeus
[1:38:56] mark columbus or wesley or or elijah
[1:39:00] okay but the second death or the second
[1:39:04] resurrection
[1:39:06] people remember the bible says they come
[1:39:08] out of the earth they come out of the
[1:39:09] sea
[1:39:10] they've got to come out of the bottom of
[1:39:11] the sea they came out all the different
[1:39:13] places why
[1:39:14] general resurrection you don't want to
[1:39:17] be part of that general resurrection
[1:39:20] because you're going to be judged by
[1:39:21] what you did
[1:39:23] i do not want to be judged by what i did
[1:39:26] but look but they shall be priests of
[1:39:28] god so they must be pretty good people
[1:39:30] antichrist and shall reign with him 1
[1:39:33] 000 years let's go to the next one
[1:39:37] everybody all right we got to get to a
[1:39:38] point here i'm sorry but i would not
[1:39:40] have you ignorant brethren
[1:39:43] listen we're not ignorant
[1:39:46] you can't plead ignorance in this day
[1:39:48] and time not if you've sat around this
[1:39:49] church for long enough
[1:39:51] but i would not have you that's why i
[1:39:52] said the books open amen
[1:39:54] it becomes more plain listen this is not
[1:39:57] hard
[1:39:58] this is not hard to live once you get
[1:40:00] the liver inside of you
[1:40:06] because listen if the man that wrote it
[1:40:11] we know there's one man
[1:40:14] jesus christ the creator of the world he
[1:40:16] wrote the bible
[1:40:18] if he is inside of you how can they
[1:40:21] contradict
[1:40:23] when you read the bible sure there's
[1:40:24] things you don't understand but how can
[1:40:26] you say that's not right in the bible if
[1:40:28] you have the one that wrote it inside of
[1:40:30] you
[1:40:31] impossible totally impossible
[1:40:34] because you ain't got the right person
[1:40:35] inside of you that's why you're
[1:40:37] anyway i didn't want to say that but it
[1:40:38] did anyway but listen if you realize
[1:40:41] that you have that
[1:40:43] praise god if you realize that you've
[1:40:46] been to see but that your eyes have been
[1:40:48] opened
[1:40:49] oh praise god there's a lot of people
[1:40:51] that's going to be blind forever
[1:40:53] spiritually blind i'd rather be
[1:40:56] naturally blind a hundred times over
[1:40:58] than to be spiritually blind
[1:41:02] but i would not have you ignorant
[1:41:03] brethren concerning them which are
[1:41:04] asleep
[1:41:05] not dead that you sorrow not even as
[1:41:08] others which have no hope
[1:41:12] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:41:13] rose again even so them also which sleep
[1:41:15] in jesus
[1:41:17] will god bring with him
[1:41:22] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:41:24] the lord
[1:41:26] that we which are alive there's that
[1:41:27] alive
[1:41:29] i was telling you about it alive so in
[1:41:31] other words these people have not
[1:41:33] they they're they're not part of the
[1:41:35] resurrection
[1:41:37] they're part of the calling because
[1:41:40] they're alive
[1:41:40] you got to be alive if you're dead you
[1:41:43] can you can
[1:41:45] be considered in the resurrection but if
[1:41:46] you're alive you've got to be the one
[1:41:49] that speaks it
[1:41:50] we which are alive and remain unto the
[1:41:52] coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:41:55] them which are asleep for the lord
[1:41:57] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:41:59] shout
[1:42:01] voice of an archangel and the trump of
[1:42:03] god listen
[1:42:05] the world thinks he's going to come down
[1:42:06] through the eastern skies like i said
[1:42:09] this morning
[1:42:10] park the eastern skies and have a
[1:42:11] trumpet i reckon gabriel or somebody's
[1:42:13] going to be going
[1:42:17] that's a message there's a message
[1:42:20] that's come to us
[1:42:23] a message a shout that turned our head
[1:42:25] and said wow i've been deceived all my
[1:42:29] life
[1:42:30] now i see the light that ought to make
[1:42:33] you shout
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:36] and the voice of an archangel with a
[1:42:38] trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:42:40] shall rise
[1:42:41] first wow then
[1:42:44] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:42:48] caught up
[1:42:49] rapture together with them in the clouds
[1:42:51] to meet the lord in the air so shall we
[1:42:52] ever be with the lord wherefore comfort
[1:42:54] one another
[1:42:55] with these words let's go to the next
[1:42:56] scripture and then we'll stop right here
[1:42:58] behold i show you a mystery then
[1:43:02] revelation 10 7 said what
[1:43:06] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:43:08] angel when he begins to sound the
[1:43:11] mystery one mystery not mysteries the
[1:43:14] mystery of god shall be finished
[1:43:15] to me the great mystery is how god can
[1:43:18] save your soul
[1:43:21] show you the message of your hour
[1:43:25] you be in it and live it and if you have
[1:43:27] to go by the grave no problem you're
[1:43:29] going to be brought back up but the ones
[1:43:30] that are alive and remain
[1:43:31] are going to sound the trumpet
[1:43:35] gospel trumpet not
[1:43:38] sorry behold i show you a mystery
[1:43:42] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[1:43:45] changed
[1:43:47] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:43:49] it's the last trump for the trumpet
[1:43:51] shall sound
[1:43:52] the dead in christ shall be raised
[1:43:54] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:43:57] for this corrupt we must put on the
[1:43:58] incorruption this mortal must put on
[1:43:59] immortality
[1:44:00] you know i was thinking just now brought
[1:44:02] to my attention
[1:44:04] you look at we talk about replacement
[1:44:06] and resurrection
[1:44:07] or change talk about the change of the
[1:44:09] body
[1:44:11] now when abraham and sarah
[1:44:18] they weren't like a cocoon or a
[1:44:22] katy did or whatever that is you know
[1:44:24] you see that thing up on the
[1:44:25] side of the tree that it split open and
[1:44:27] the new one flies out and leaves that
[1:44:29] old thing
[1:44:31] right abraham didn't roll over and his
[1:44:33] old body
[1:44:35] they have to do something with
[1:44:38] right it sounds silly but it's not
[1:44:41] replacement folks
[1:44:42] it's changing what was there it's
[1:44:45] changing dead abraham
[1:44:47] changing dead sarah back to young man
[1:44:50] and woman again
[1:44:52] so they could have a child but they had
[1:44:55] to meet the son of man first
[1:44:58] they had to meet god in human flesh a
[1:45:01] prefigure in the son of man now that
[1:45:03] wasn't jesus well that was
[1:45:04] theophany of jesus but that wasn't the
[1:45:05] one that died for us everybody
[1:45:06] understand that
[1:45:09] so see we're to be changed
[1:45:13] wow could you imagine here's abraham 99
[1:45:16] years old
[1:45:18] sarah 89 they went to bed like this
[1:45:26] i'll get there in a minute
[1:45:31] and of course they don't have they
[1:45:34] didn't have
[1:45:35] king size uh serta
[1:45:39] sleep number thermopedic
[1:45:42] memory foam
[1:45:46] water beds
[1:45:50] they had a pallet laying on the floor
[1:45:55] with straw straw tech and can you
[1:45:57] imagine laying down at 99
[1:46:00] they're hoping for a resurrection that's
[1:46:01] for sure but the next morning for
[1:46:04] abraham
[1:46:07] i'm making light but still that's going
[1:46:09] to happen folks
[1:46:11] i from by the word of the lord somebody
[1:46:14] in this room is going to take a body
[1:46:15] change
[1:46:16] they're going to wake up one morning or
[1:46:17] they're going to walk or they're going
[1:46:19] to be walking down the hallway and
[1:46:20] they'll be going like this
[1:46:21] and all of a sudden they're going to go
[1:46:24] oh man
[1:46:26] but what did abraham do that morning
[1:46:27] abraham turned over and went whoa
[1:46:31] i'm in bed with the wrong woman
[1:46:34] i went to bed with an 89 year old and i
[1:46:36] woke up and she's 20.
[1:46:39] sarah looks over at him and goes abraham
[1:46:43] you've changed you know what brother
[1:46:47] brown when he went across the curtain of
[1:46:48] time remember he he didn't really
[1:46:50] realize it he looked back and saw the
[1:46:51] old man
[1:46:52] but he reached up and said i got hair
[1:46:57] i don't have wrinkles right
[1:47:02] that's the truth folks that really
[1:47:04] happened
[1:47:06] and just as sure as it happened to
[1:47:07] abraham and sarah it's going to happen
[1:47:09] to me and you
[1:47:10] somebody is going to stand one day and
[1:47:13] say
[1:47:13] corruption you have met your maker
[1:47:17] i'm not taking this no more i'm not
[1:47:20] going to take this
[1:47:21] anymore i'm going to be changed
[1:47:24] now let's go to the next scripture and
[1:47:26] then we'll close musicians get ready to
[1:47:27] come
[1:47:28] revelations 4. this is where we were
[1:47:31] this morning
[1:47:32] sorry donny we didn't get any further
[1:47:34] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:47:36] was opened in heaven
[1:47:37] the first voice which i heard was it
[1:47:39] were of a trumpet now look after this
[1:47:40] after what after the church ages look
[1:47:43] this is the last church age
[1:47:46] number seven there were seven stars
[1:47:48] there were seven candlesticks there's no
[1:47:49] more church ages this is
[1:47:51] it we're at the end time if you don't
[1:47:53] know we're at the end time then we got a
[1:47:55] problem
[1:47:56] let me talk to you about a few things
[1:47:58] and after this i looked and behold the
[1:48:00] door was open in heaven look and the
[1:48:01] first
[1:48:02] voice which i heard was it where there's
[1:48:04] always a trumpet somewhere
[1:48:08] there's always a trumpet going off
[1:48:10] somebody's got a trumpet in their hand
[1:48:12] or somebody's
[1:48:13] getting ready to sound a trumpet what is
[1:48:14] that it's a voice
[1:48:16] what did the trumpet do it sounded to
[1:48:18] battle
[1:48:19] listen way back before there was
[1:48:22] communication
[1:48:25] if you had two million people fighting
[1:48:28] like the children of israel would have
[1:48:30] hundreds of thousands on a battlefield
[1:48:31] well they might be stretched two miles
[1:48:34] they couldn't talk to each other they
[1:48:37] listened
[1:48:38] for that trumpet
[1:48:42] and if that trumpet gave a certain sound
[1:48:44] they could charge if that trumpet gave
[1:48:46] another certain sound
[1:48:47] they couldn't charge if that trumpet
[1:48:50] gave a certain sound
[1:48:51] they had to go over so many meters and
[1:48:53] come around this way
[1:48:54] that was what a type of communication
[1:48:57] so that's what when you see trumpet in
[1:48:59] the bible it's not
[1:49:01] excuse me it's not this that's right
[1:49:04] this is a symbol now what does this do
[1:49:08] it sounds what he's blowing
[1:49:16] sometimes pretty good yeah you ain't
[1:49:18] kidding you do a good job with this
[1:49:19] thing
[1:49:20] but this right here is is an instrument
[1:49:23] used by a man
[1:49:27] to get a message to a group of people
[1:49:31] so when you see that word trumpet it's
[1:49:34] god
[1:49:35] through somebody bringing you a message
[1:49:40] this is the prophets
[1:49:43] what would you think isaiah would do
[1:49:45] when isaiah was this thing right here
[1:49:47] and isaiah was a young man
[1:49:49] but isaiah stood up one day and said a
[1:49:50] virgin shall conceive
[1:49:54] wow
[1:49:58] his wife was probably behind him pulling
[1:50:00] his coattail going where'd you get that
[1:50:03] he said i don't know but it's what
[1:50:05] somebody told me to say
[1:50:07] that's right it's what god told me
[1:50:09] because he was blowing
[1:50:10] the note right
[1:50:14] through my soul and the voice came out
[1:50:17] the other end
[1:50:19] a virgin shall conceive that was a
[1:50:21] trumpet same way with this right here
[1:50:24] i heard as it were a trumpet talking
[1:50:26] with me a trumpet doesn't talk
[1:50:30] so it was somebody talking saying
[1:50:34] come up hither come up to another
[1:50:37] dimension come up to another place
[1:50:39] because you're going in a rapture come
[1:50:42] up hither and i will show
[1:50:43] these things which must be hereafter and
[1:50:46] i immediately
[1:50:47] i was in the spirit and behold a throne
[1:50:51] not thrones a throne was set in heaven
[1:50:54] and
[1:50:55] one sat on that throne
[1:50:58] one not three one right
[1:51:03] john is the top of the bride right
[1:51:06] so he went up in revelations 4 in a
[1:51:09] rapture
[1:51:10] he took a rapture by that voice
[1:51:15] that talked to him now what do we when
[1:51:16] the last trumpet sounds
[1:51:18] yes we've had a message
[1:51:22] that last trumpet has sounded what are
[1:51:24] you going to do about it
[1:51:28] some have given uncertain sounds yes
[1:51:32] in the hand of a skilled person it's
[1:51:34] beautiful
[1:51:37] if i picked it up you'd hear nothing but
[1:51:40] spit
[1:51:43] yeah uncertain right but that's the same
[1:51:46] instrument
[1:51:48] it was just blown by somebody that
[1:51:50] didn't know what they were doing
[1:51:51] but it's also blown that was me i'm
[1:51:54] talking about
[1:51:55] but it's also blown by somebody that
[1:51:57] knows how to hold it
[1:52:01] a professional and you better listen to
[1:52:04] what comes out to end
[1:52:06] because it's true today i've told you
[1:52:09] the truth
[1:52:11] as far as i know i've told you the truth
[1:52:12] of god
[1:52:14] and what you do with it is your business
[1:52:20] because we're all free moral agents we
[1:52:22] can choose to accept or reject
[1:52:27] so choose you this day who you'll serve
[1:52:31] let's stand our feet
[1:52:35] so the bride's going to take a rapture
[1:52:38] we didn't we didn't use our chart
[1:52:40] but the bride's going to take a rapture
[1:52:41] the church is not
[1:52:43] the church is going to stay here those
[1:52:45] that have received the mark of the beast
[1:52:46] will not go in the first resurrection
[1:52:51] right if you've received the mark of the
[1:52:55] beast you're not going into first
[1:52:56] resurrection
[1:53:00] but if you receive the seal of god you
[1:53:03] will go in the first resurrection
[1:53:08] we'll start next couple of weeks now
[1:53:10] brother pray for brother hayek coming
[1:53:12] but matthew 17 says after six days peter
[1:53:15] james and john
[1:53:16] was took up to a high mountain and was
[1:53:18] transfigured in his face shown as a son
[1:53:20] and behold there appeared unto them
[1:53:22] moses and elijah
[1:53:24] talking with them that's where we get to
[1:53:26] because
[1:53:27] the first resurrection once we are
[1:53:29] resurrected
[1:53:30] and get out of here those two witnesses
[1:53:33] are going to go to the jews
[1:53:36] according to revelations 13
[1:53:40] amen or revelations 11
[1:53:43] 3 through 7. i'm going to give power to
[1:53:46] my two witness and they shall prophesy a
[1:53:47] thousand 200
[1:53:49] in three score days to continue the plan
[1:53:52] of redemption
[1:53:54] for the jews the plan of redemption for
[1:53:56] the gentiles is over
[1:53:57] listen they ain't none of this left
[1:53:58] behind stuff
[1:54:00] that's right that's false that's the
[1:54:02] devil
[1:54:04] if you miss the first resurrection you
[1:54:06] ain't coming up and getting saved
[1:54:08] you're going to the second resurrection
[1:54:09] you're going to have to give an account
[1:54:10] for what you did on the earth
[1:54:12] amen and you don't have much of a chance
[1:54:16] when you get there
[1:54:17] sorry because if i'm judged by my works
[1:54:21] i'm going to hell anyway right
[1:54:25] but see i took his judgment he took my
[1:54:28] judgment
[1:54:29] and now i stand with him and if he's a
[1:54:31] judge now

[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:35] i'll be raptured by
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:46] to the world we're crazy
[1:57:50] because we're not normal and that means
[1:57:52] crazy
[1:57:55] but they called god himself in human
[1:57:58] flesh they called jesus
[1:57:59] belgium they called him a wine bibber
[1:58:03] they said you hang around centers and
[1:58:06] prostitutes
[1:58:08] well who are you he was god in human
[1:58:12] flesh
[1:58:14] and that same god by the new birth is
[1:58:17] inside of you
[1:58:18] he's in your human flesh and he's going
[1:58:21] to make you act different than the world
[1:58:24] that's why folks it's not that we
[1:58:27] suppress
[1:58:27] our women and suppress our men and
[1:58:30] suppress
[1:58:30] our feelings because the bible tells
[1:58:34] us jesus said you'll be in this world
[1:58:37] but you'll not be of this world
[1:58:39] that's right and i'll protect you
[1:58:42] because i'll be with you even in you
[1:58:47] so see if it's not an inner work it's no
[1:58:49] good anyway
[1:58:50] that's it i mean if i have to remind
[1:58:53] june to not cut her hair every day
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:58] so the same way with god if god has to
[1:58:59] remind us
[1:59:02] no get the one that wrote the bible
[1:59:05] inside of you
[1:59:07] he can't do anything but lead you and
[1:59:10] guide you into all truth
[1:59:12] he can't go against his own word i you
[1:59:15] know i'll take what the bible says
[1:59:18] okay amen over anything that's
[1:59:22] contrary to the word of god
[1:59:25] it doesn't matter who it comes from like
[1:59:28] daddy's always said it come from a dumb
[1:59:29] donkey one time
[1:59:31] spoke to a prophet a dumb donkey
[1:59:34] spoke to a prophet and told balaam well
[1:59:37] he was a false prophet
[1:59:39] but god was telling him don't go this
[1:59:40] way don't go this way don't go this way
[1:59:42] and he finally
[1:59:44] had the donkey had to talk and tell the
[1:59:45] prophet why because his backslid
[1:59:49] let's don't have an animal to tell us
[1:59:51] that we're backslid
[1:59:53] amen you pray to god this week that this
[1:59:58] service next week will be it'll be
