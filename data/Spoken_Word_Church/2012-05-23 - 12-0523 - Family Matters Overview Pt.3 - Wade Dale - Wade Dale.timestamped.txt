[10:09] amen amen 1 Peter
[10:13] 3 verse 1 through
[10:17] 7 likewise you wives be in subjection to
[10:20] your own husbands that if any obey not
[10:22] the word they also May without the word
[10:25] be one by the conversation of the wives
[10:28] amen while they behold their chaste
[10:31] conversation coupled with fear whose
[10:33] adorning let it not be that outward
[10:35] adorning of platting the haon of wearing
[10:37] of gold or putting on of apparel but let
[10:40] it be the hidden man of the heart and
[10:42] that which is not corruptible even the
[10:44] ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[10:46] which is in the sight of God of great
[10:48] price God thinks a lot of our spirit
[10:50] right our meek and quiet spirit for
[10:53] after this manner in the old time the
[10:55] holy women also who trusted in God
[10:57] adorned themselves being in subjection
[11:00] unto their own husband even as Sarah
[11:02] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[11:05] daughters you are as long as you do well
[11:07] and are not afraid with any amazement
[11:10] likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[11:12] according to knowledge and that's what
[11:13] we're going to talk about tonight dwell
[11:15] with them according to knowledge giving
[11:17] honor unto the wife as unto the weaker
[11:19] Bessel and as being HS together of the
[11:22] grace of life that your prayers be not
[11:25] hindered you may be seated and the Lord
[11:27] add his Blessing to the to the of his
[11:29] word and the last Sunday we kind of got
[11:31] on to the marriage part and and this is
[11:34] going to be more of a review but we
[11:37] wanted to kind of do it and now it's
[11:38] going to be a it'll be a three part
[11:41] instead of a 12p
[11:44] part and we kind of skipped over the
[11:47] role of the male and the role of the
[11:49] female and went to the U to the role of
[11:52] the male and the female while they were
[11:53] having children and how to raise up
[11:55] their children and I hope you enjoyed
[11:57] that this weekend cu I really enjoyed it
[11:59] to it it showed more about how God's
[12:01] going to train you and I how God's going
[12:03] to bring you and I up and how that if he
[12:05] spares a rod he SPS this child right the
[12:08] rod of Correction the rod of correction
[12:10] from here right all right the rod of
[12:12] correction from the word of God it's
[12:14] just bad that you and I have to live in
[12:16] these sinful bodies and and we have to
[12:19] be reminded that we're wrong born in sin
[12:22] shaping their iniquity spouse from our
[12:24] mother's womb a liar so we get whipped
[12:26] for telling lies all right so God
[12:28] whipped us for telling lies God's
[12:30] whipped us brother Brown said a
[12:31] Christian will do what sin of sin a
[12:34] Christian will reap a tub full why cuz
[12:37] you should know better you should know
[12:39] better and in in the adoption stage as a
[12:42] little child God doesn't whip us when we
[12:44] first get started we'd be like the the
[12:47] little kid that um that uh what's her
[12:49] name Kathy sister Kathy uh and Chris you
[12:52] know when they came here brother K's
[12:55] niece niece I mean that little boy he
[12:58] knew knew he was doing wrong and he knew
[13:00] what he was getting and the first thing
[13:01] he done was this yeah well you know that
[13:03] we don't do that God doesn't do that
[13:05] with us when we're first little baby
[13:07] right God knows that we're human right
[13:10] so we don't Flinch cuz he's a loving God
[13:12] he's a God that says hey that's okay you
[13:14] know we're going to help you through
[13:15] this but now once we get and sat in a
[13:17] seat for about 20 years in the church
[13:19] and we get preached to then you better
[13:21] start doing some of this cuz it's coming
[13:25] and we deserve it if God brings it we
[13:28] deserve it right all right now we're not
[13:30] legalists and we're not life beaters and
[13:32] we're not children beaters amen wait a
[13:35] minute this is a new age our men our our
[13:37] husband beaters
[13:40] yeah I mean it used to be that you know
[13:43] you had the the men that that whipped
[13:45] the women but now I think we got some
[13:47] women that pretty much take care of the
[13:49] men like I told you about that that time
[13:51] I went to Gainesville you know and
[13:53] pulled up in that traffic light and a
[13:55] big old man and woman was sitting in
[13:56] that car and he popped her upside the
[13:58] head and
[13:59] grabbed her and started shaking her like
[14:00] that and I thought buddy if you continue
[14:02] that I'm going to get out of my car but
[14:04] it wasn't but about 2 seconds he let her
[14:06] go and that was his first
[14:10] mistake cuz buddy she come with a left
[14:13] and she hit him upside the head and his
[14:15] old head just went out the wind out the
[14:17] window and come back in and I thought
[14:18] I'm okay she's okay I'm not going to get
[14:21] involved but buddy she let him have it I
[14:24] can see that just as well in my mind as
[14:26] if it was yesterday she hit him about
[14:29] three times the the the the uh light
[14:31] turned green and they're still sitting
[14:33] there and I wasn't going to blow the
[14:35] horn I afid she might get out I wasn't
[14:38] worried about him anymore I was afraid
[14:40] she was going to get out and take care
[14:42] of me but she took care of business but
[14:44] now in at this age you can say well wife
[14:46] beaters and Men beaters but we're not
[14:48] any of that right right we don't we
[14:50] don't do that the rod of Correction is
[14:53] is supposed to be given but it's
[14:56] supposed to be given with love amen same
[14:59] way when I told you about whipping your
[15:00] child don't ever whip your child when
[15:01] it's what angry when you're angry don't
[15:04] do that okay right cuz you may hurt
[15:08] somebody you may hurt it uh you may hurt
[15:11] them physically you don't want to beat
[15:13] them physically
[15:15] right just give them a little spanking
[15:17] so I I hope we kind of covered all that
[15:20] well enough to where we all make
[15:21] mistakes
[15:23] right as adults as people that raise
[15:26] children and and you know we make
[15:29] mistakes but remember God doesn't make
[15:31] mistakes right amen so we talk about the
[15:33] spiritual aspect a little bit more now
[15:35] that that God gives us correction but
[15:38] you know what he does he keeps us he
[15:40] keeps us by the word of God and that's
[15:42] the correction that we get we don't have
[15:44] to get physically whipped right you know
[15:46] we we get whipped by the word and we
[15:48] know as we become more mature we know
[15:51] it's coming right cuz we say uh-oh here
[15:54] it comes cuz we did something wrong all
[15:57] right well the kids should be be the
[15:58] same way Josh turned 29
[16:03] yesterday 29 for the first time for the
[16:06] first time yeah yeah made me old 29
[16:10] years old and you know what I don't have
[16:13] to beat him I'd love to but I don't have
[16:16] to cuz he's his own person he he's he's
[16:19] his own he gets his own he has his own
[16:20] ability to to think and and we do the
[16:23] best we can but like mom always says the
[16:25] Bible says when they are older they want
[16:28] to apart from you when they're older
[16:30] right all right God's God's
[16:32] longsuffering with you and I when we're
[16:34] older brother Rand the gospel amen bring
[16:37] a child up in the way it should go right
[16:40] God bring a child up in the way it
[16:42] should go talking spiritual now right
[16:44] all right bring a child up the way it
[16:45] should go and when he gets older more
[16:48] mature he'll not depart from it right
[16:51] sure we backslide we do things wrong but
[16:53] you know what we're supposed to be
[16:54] getting that what getting to that chisel
[16:57] getting that home get holding that thing
[16:59] down where it gets more narrow and
[17:02] narrow as we go up
[17:04] right I'm and I'm trying to make a point
[17:07] here because I'm trying to I want to go
[17:08] into the spiritual aspect of it but
[17:10] we've got to remember that we can't keep
[17:12] making the same mistakes though right
[17:15] amen we can't do that right amen we got
[17:18] to come up a level uh I was reading um
[17:22] somebody one of our neighbors was giving
[17:24] some books away and it's a really neat
[17:26] book it's about this thick it was
[17:28] written by Smith Wigglesworth everybody
[17:30] know who Smith Wigglesworth is all right
[17:32] uh actually he died the same year in
[17:35] close to about the same month that
[17:37] brother Bram came on the scene all right
[17:39] so he died and then brother then brother
[17:41] Bram came on the scene but Smith
[17:43] Wigglesworth was known for a lot of
[17:45] things he he has been documented to
[17:47] raise have raised 23 people from the
[17:50] dead one man was already
[17:53] inbombed and in the
[17:56] casket and he was reporting that he that
[17:59] he prayed for him rais him from the dead
[18:00] so I was reading some of those things
[18:02] and and the whole part of this is is a
[18:05] lot of that book is his sermons and
[18:07] there little sermon Nets he preached
[18:09] every day to somebody every day Smith
[18:15] Wigglesworth preached every day to
[18:16] somebody yeah he said there's only one
[18:19] thing going to be in my house to read
[18:20] and that's the Bible he said all else is
[18:24] junk he never read they said he never
[18:26] read a newspaper he either read the
[18:28] Bible or some of his own study notes he
[18:30] read nothing else and great man of Faith
[18:33] he uh there was a man one time that was
[18:36] Apprentice of his that did not have any
[18:38] he his legs were cut off at the
[18:42] kneecaps okay they was cut off at the
[18:45] kneecaps both of them he said the Lord
[18:48] told him one night woke him up one night
[18:49] and said you go tell your servant that
[18:51] tomorrow for him to go down to the shoe
[18:53] shop tell him to get him a pair of shoes

[19:00] time they put the shoes down he'll have
[19:02] new legs well of course the guy was a
[19:04] little

[20:24] Monday cuz I stayed up till about 1:30
[20:27] but I I really got into reading some of
[20:28] the things but what struck me was he
[20:30] lived such a life
[20:33] right that had nothing to do with the
[20:35] message of the hour right he died 1947
[20:39] brother Brown came on the scene 1947
[20:41] really preaching the word of God right y
[20:44] he come up FF Bosworth came up under him
[20:47] really first and then brother Brown came
[20:50] up you know right there with brother FF
[20:52] Bosworth but Smith wiglesworth I started
[20:54] reading some of his some of his um
[20:57] sermons
[20:59] and and you see how that the Holy Spirit
[21:02] progressed from Smith Wigglesworth to
[21:03] brother brandham because a lot of the
[21:05] things that brother brandham said Smith
[21:06] wesworth said in that book I can show it
[21:08] to you I can underline it look it's just
[21:10] almost verbatim I started to bring it
[21:12] tonight and read a quote I had a quote I
[21:14] was going to read that quote and ask you
[21:16] did you believe it and you'd probably
[21:18] say oh yeah that was brother Bram no
[21:20] that was Smith Borth right talking about
[21:23] the Holy Spirit about the Holy Spirit in
[21:27] encompassing our whole being yeah and
[21:30] taking us in a Rapture I mean here this
[21:32] guy's talking about going in a Rapture
[21:35] this guy's talking about the Holy Ghost
[21:36] being in us so much till like he said
[21:40] you you get an inspiration from God and
[21:42] you go tell a guy that don't have legs
[21:44] yeah that tomorrow he's going to have
[21:47] legs amen come on folks I mean this is
[21:50] getting off the sermon a little bit but
[21:52] but but what struck me was that that
[21:54] here was a man
[21:56] that was filled with the Holy Ghost
[21:59] under a trinitarian Doctrine amen read
[22:02] the word of God with a trinitarian
[22:04] Doctrine yeah but look at the power he
[22:07] had right you know why he lived an
[22:10] exemplary life right amen his life was
[22:14] so close to God he married a he married
[22:16] a lady and they only stayed married
[22:18] maybe I think about 16 or 17 years and
[22:20] she passed away had a couple of children
[22:22] had two two sons and a daughter I think
[22:24] it was but he lived straight on never
[22:28] got married again he lived straight on
[22:31] into the 40 you know into his 40s and
[22:32] 50s 60s '70s I think he died when he was
[22:35] like 88 years old he was born in 1850
[22:37] something or something like that or 1880
[22:39] something and he died in 1947 but you
[22:42] know what you say well that that's not
[22:45] watching that's not reading the
[22:46] prophet's message
[22:49] well it gives you a good background to
[22:52] show you that if you're not living right
[22:53] it ain't going to do you any good to
[22:55] read The Prophet's
[22:56] message okay okay we're not living an
[22:59] exemplary life first right I wish
[23:02] sometimes we could pull the message away
[23:06] and God forbid what I'm saying and
[23:08] forget about it yeah forget about it
[23:11] just get born again right get born again
[23:14] under what's in this Bible right here
[23:16] right amen that Jesus died for our sins
[23:18] Brother Gary that Jesus Christ came down
[23:20] and filled you with the Holy Ghost right
[23:22] right that didn't need a message right
[23:25] but then God did bring us a message
[23:27] Glory and here we are now God brought us
[23:30] a message on top of right of what Smith
[23:33] Wigglesworth had on top of what FF
[23:35] Bosworth had right amen the greatest
[23:38] message ever to to come to the face of
[23:40] the Earth yes
[23:42] Lord but I read you a quote last Sunday
[23:45] where we're missing it is in the life
[23:48] right right the walk the walk is where
[23:50] we're missing it amen get the walk right
[23:53] so you say what's that got to do with
[23:55] this this says right here
[23:59] go ahead brother Anderson the role of
[24:00] the
[24:02] male we're going through all these roles
[24:04] do you know if you're not in your role
[24:06] or your
[24:08] position yeah then you're out of the
[24:10] will of God right you're out of the will
[24:13] of
[24:14] God I'm sorry I didn't make the
[24:19] rules roll of the man the man needs to
[24:23] understand his role I told you many
[24:25] times that I I don't want somebody to
[24:26] just say like I've said uh when we first
[24:29] did this I know the Bible says a woman's
[24:32] not supposed to cut her ha why right why
[24:37] cuz she comes out from under her
[24:38] headship and becomes a man right she's
[24:40] in her own position she trims her hair
[24:43] then she comes under where a man says
[24:44] you're not supposed to have long hair
[24:45] and you're supposed to cut your hair
[24:47] right that's us we're supposed to cut
[24:48] her hair right if she cuts her hair she
[24:51] has took herself out from under the
[24:52] position that she's in not just don't
[24:55] cut your hair sister no you know what
[24:57] you're doing you're reflecting that
[24:58] you've forgotten your headship right
[25:01] amen and remember your ultimate headship
[25:05] is who Christ Glory so you're doing away
[25:09] with your
[25:12] headship you have no protection right
[25:15] right you have no protection you do the
[25:18] things you're supposed to do and you
[25:19] come down in the role of the female and
[25:21] you do what you're supposed to be doing
[25:23] this is a guy that's going to give an
[25:25] account yeah not you but if you come
[25:28] over here like this you're decep to a
[25:31] lot of things yeah that's why God had to
[25:34] put it down in in the book of
[25:35] Corinthians and all that to show
[25:37] headship even back when Adam he said now
[25:40] Eve what you did said you're going the
[25:41] man's going to have to rule over you
[25:43] because of what you
[25:44] did right but we got to remember too our
[25:48] head is who Christ Glory all right head
[25:51] every man is Christ head of every woman
[25:54] is a
[25:54] man amen stay under that you don't lose
[25:59] so these roles of the man and roles of
[26:01] the roles of the male and roles of the
[26:03] female is not just something I conjured
[26:05] up it's not just something that looks
[26:08] good it's scripture right break
[26:11] scripture and you're breaking the word
[26:13] of God and that makes you a
[26:16] what well a
[26:18] sinner the man needs to understand his
[26:21] role so he can know how to act and react
[26:24] to situations in a marriage what his
[26:26] position and and be obedient to that
[26:28] position because sisters whether you
[26:30] believe it or not we're supposed to be
[26:31] obedient too right
[26:33] amen we're supposed to be obedient too
[26:36] to our head Christ right the female
[26:40] should also understand what the male's
[26:42] role
[26:43] is so she can understand I want you
[26:46] sisters to understand your role and get
[26:50] in that role right amen what what the
[26:54] male's role is so she can help him what
[26:57] be a help meet what suitable someone
[27:00] suitable that's what help meet means
[27:02] suitable someone suitable to fulfill his
[27:05] role we can't fulfill our role as a
[27:07] husband if we don't have a good wife
[27:10] right God can't fulfill his role without
[27:12] having a wife right that's right that's
[27:16] right he can't remember he's not he's
[27:19] not complete remember Prophet said
[27:20] Christ the my God real he's not complete
[27:22] without us right not my rules he made
[27:25] the rules right but the rule is says
[27:27] that if you do come under his headship
[27:30] then guess what you get his protection
[27:32] right right sisters you see what I mean
[27:35] about you disobeying God you come out
[27:38] from under your headship God don't slide
[27:40] over here and protect you
[27:44] right he stays over here with the
[27:47] man you slide over here you have no
[27:50] headship and no protect you know what
[27:52] you've done you've elevated
[27:54] yourself right that's why brother brand
[27:57] said remember that quote I read to you
[27:58] from the church age book that you become
[28:01] Antichrist yeah right that's an
[28:03] antichrist Spirit when you come out from
[28:05] under the headship of your husband right
[28:08] cuz what do you do when you come out of
[28:10] the under the headship of Christ you
[28:12] think you become Christ and that was
[28:14] what what the devil wants you to do
[28:16] right so now the man needs to understand
[28:18] his role the woman needs to understand
[28:20] her role to do what to fulfill his role
[28:24] right the man according to the word of
[28:27] God right all right now let's go to
[28:29] Ephesians 5 here it is for the husband
[28:31] is the head of the woman even as Christ
[28:34] is the head of the church and he is the
[28:37] savior of the body now who is my body

[29:33] Authority right who's the final
[29:36] authority of our headship Christ Christ
[29:38] is the final Authority we don't go to
[29:41] ask somebody else we don't go to ask the
[29:43] neighbor or the postman or the guy down
[29:45] at the convenience store no our headship
[29:48] is Christ we do what he says we don't
[29:50] get a second opinion amen amen now I'm

[30:03] stay where you're supposed to be look
[30:06] you still got the protection of Christ
[30:08] does everybody understand you see what
[30:10] I'm saying here's Christ this light is
[30:12] Christ here's the man and here's the
[30:14] female if he does according to the word
[30:16] of God and you do according to the word
[30:18] of God it stays just like that look at
[30:20] the protection you got right all right

[31:47] you got that right that's right better
[31:48] believe it that's why better believe it
[31:50] that's better believe it head of the
[31:52] house all right let's go to the next one
[31:55] now remember
[31:57] as and we we were speaking
[32:00] before the husband needs to take the
[32:04] initiative or to initiate to instruct in
[32:08] the principle of something to
[32:10] start so if you got a problem and you
[32:12] need to talk about something husbands
[32:15] you really are the ones that your wives
[32:17] are the weaker vessel they get caught up
[32:19] in all the
[32:20] drama feelings
[32:23] emotions you're supposed to be the
[32:25] stable one
[32:27] Christ doesn't get caught up in all
[32:29] these emotions he's the stable one all
[32:32] right he's the one that that that takes
[32:34] care of all the situations
[32:38] hey brothers and sisters he was the
[32:41] greatest initiator yeah he started his
[32:45] whole thing right amen when he said let
[32:48] there be and all this came with it right
[32:52] he said let there be he was the greatest
[32:54] initiator but you got to remember you
[32:56] come on down a little bit father he's
[32:57] the protector he's the one same way with
[33:00] Christ Christ was the initiator to
[33:02] instruct and the principle of something
[33:03] to start let there be but he knew the
[33:06] way we were going to be so he said wives
[33:09] instead of being like this in the garden
[33:11] that's what I meant to do see this right
[33:12] here in the garden this is the way it
[33:14] was right God come down talked to man
[33:17] and man and wife was one co-equal but
[33:20] when what happened you had to do this
[33:22] cuz this is a weaker vessel she caused
[33:25] the fall right
[33:27] right right right so here we go Christ
[33:31] had to initiate it though he come down
[33:33] and said I'll put enmity right Adam
[33:35] didn't stand up brother Dan Adam didn't
[33:37] stand up and do that did he he couldn't
[33:40] but God said I'll py in other words I'll
[33:42] initiate this thing I'm the one that
[33:45] started it and I'm the one that's going
[33:46] to finish it there's a good headship
[33:49] same way with a husband and I know as as
[33:52] as human beings we do things
[33:55] wrong sure yeah right God don't do
[33:58] things wrong no what he initiated and
[34:01] started ain't going to get off on a
[34:03] rabbit Trail
[34:04] some he's going to see it go all the way
[34:06] through what if we stay in our position
[34:08] so will we Glory he's the initiator
[34:12] right of
[34:13] all and here it comes down to us we stay
[34:16] right here right guess what we are
[34:18] benefactors of that benefactors of his
[34:22] resurrection benefactors of all things
[34:24] holy ghost coming on that Pentecost
[34:26] we're benefact of all that right cuz
[34:28] what's he doing he's restoring it back
[34:30] to here right right amen thank you Lord
[34:33] God and
[34:34] Christ amen right then what we come
[34:38] right up and we're little Messiah right
[34:41] we are God right
[34:46] right let me tell you
[34:48] something when we get to
[34:51] heaven this is just the way I see it
[34:54] when we get to heaven everything's going
[34:55] to be restored back right amen amen if
[34:58] they want to see Christ they're going to
[34:59] see brother
[35:03] dead they're going to know that we live
[35:05] in that Temple because we did one thing
[35:07] Christ was our head and we let him take
[35:10] everything that we had and do away with
[35:13] all of our sins cuz what happened a lot
[35:15] of the others come out from under their
[35:16] headship right father go father son Holy
[35:19] Ghost is not here right right that was
[35:22] in permissive right but in finality it
[35:25] never was brother Brown said it come
[35:28] from hell right father son Holy Ghost
[35:30] baptism and all those doctrines what
[35:32] happened man come out from under the
[35:34] headship of Christ word amen set up
[35:36] their own Doctrine their own
[35:39] Christ and it become anti- word that's
[35:42] why you're over here that's why they
[35:44] have no protection right you and I have
[35:47] protection amen under the headship of
[35:49] Christ and so you sisters you have
[35:52] protection under the headship right of
[35:54] your of your spouse and you man that
[35:56] can't stop gawking looking at women
[35:58] immorally dressed the idols of the day

[36:35] the cloak of another head sh right my
[36:39] brother brand when he come to that seal
[36:40] and he saw he saw the head I believe he

[36:53] here I was reading you know reading the
[36:54] fifth and sixth seal back again and you
[36:56] you see where where God give Grace and
[36:58] all those things but you also see that
[37:00] inside that Antichrist system there was
[37:02] a group of people amen trying to pull
[37:04] them away from it right all right that's
[37:07] why God's going to destroy the world

[39:59] God said so well this is not listen this
[40:03] is not something you can blame Brothers
[40:05] on you can't blame your husband right
[40:08] blame God if you're going to blame
[40:09] somebody cuz he's the one that said it
[40:12] God said so yeah this wasn't devised by
[40:15] man right right this was devised by the
[40:19] almighty because he's perfect and if we
[40:22] do what he perfectly
[40:24] says we become perect right amen God
[40:28] said so because if the husband was not
[40:30] deceived the woman was deceived and you
[40:32] preachers will continue to make women
[40:34] pastors and preachers in your church we
[40:35] know that's not for here knowing that
[40:37] the word of God condemns it oh did you
[40:40] also know that that William Seymour you
[40:43] know Daddy Seymour his wife was a
[40:45] preacher
[40:46] too he married a woman preacher and they
[40:48] both preached in Aza Street when the
[40:50] Holy Ghost fell she wasn't preaching
[40:52] then but she was a preacher that
[40:54] preached on up to 1912 and on up a
[40:56] little bit further than that so so I
[40:57] mean they had a lot of they had a lot of
[40:59] loose ends untied remember brother R
[41:01] said the seventh angel messenger had to
[41:03] come to what T all the loose in amen
[41:05] they were wrong in their scriptural
[41:07] aspect of that part of the word but that
[41:10] part of the day they were living in was
[41:13] the Holy Ghost fell giving the gifts
[41:15] back into the into the church you ought
[41:17] to read some of the Articles uh I've got
[41:20] um also a big thing from the zusa street
[41:24] Mission from 1906 about 1912 it's
[41:27] actually um newspaper articles that
[41:31] Daddy Seymour wrote telling how the Holy
[41:33] Ghost fell on this person and how the
[41:35] Holy Ghost fell in Scotland and Ireland
[41:37] and all these places it's really neat
[41:38] I'll let you read it if you want to but
[41:41] it's really neat to see how the Holy
[41:42] Ghost didn't just it fell ATA Street in
[41:44] in Los Angeles but it when it started it
[41:47] covered the world Amen all right I'll
[41:49] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh right
[41:52] all right let's go to the next
[41:55] one
[41:57] why didn't Abraham why didn't God kill
[41:59] Sarah sitting there denying and lying
[42:01] right in the face of God sitting there
[42:03] as a mortal man eating flesh eating
[42:04] bread drinking milk he said why did
[42:06] Sarah laugh back there in the back
[42:07] behind me behind him in the tent he had
[42:10] never seen her saying this how can these
[42:12] things be she said I never said it uh-oh
[42:15] my tell God that he's a liar to his face
[42:18] yeah but he couldn't take her who God
[42:21] couldn't take Sarah why she's a part of
[42:24] Abraham she called
[42:27] him cuz she was right here amen if if
[42:31] Sarah would have been out here dead
[42:34] right right exactly she was under the
[42:36] protection of Abraham brother R said she
[42:39] was a little weak in her faith yeah but
[42:42] she was covered by Abraham right all you
[42:45] sisters out you ought to shout
[42:46] hallelujah you're covered by your mail
[42:49] by your or by your
[42:52] spouse right right amen she said I never
[42:56] said it but he couldn't take her why
[42:59] she's a part of Abraham amen he couldn't
[43:01] hurt her without hurting Abraham right
[43:04] now you women see where you belong and
[43:07] the Bible said you women be like Sarah
[43:09] he's quoting the scripture we just read
[43:12] in a Peter now you women say where you
[43:15] belong and the Bible says you women be
[43:17] like Sarah was which adorned herself in
[43:19] modesty prayer lived honest and true her
[43:21] own husband loving him so much that he
[43:24] that she called him her Lord ruler
[43:27] ownership all right now what are you
[43:30] supposed to do men we're supposed to be
[43:33] responsible
[43:34] right out of all this initiating and all
[43:37] this uh all this governing we're to be
[43:41] responsible right amen for who her and
[43:45] your action right all right so it throws
[43:47] it back really sisters to us stay right
[43:51] here a lot less problem staying right
[43:54] here exactly you
[43:56] he's got to give an account for your for
[43:59] your actions but you never have to give
[44:00] an account going that way right
[44:03] initiating govern but being he head and
[44:06] being the one who is to initiate things
[44:08] also means that the man is
[44:11] responsible Butz if you initiate
[44:13] something you're responsible for it if
[44:15] you govern over something uh the
[44:17] government of the United States is
[44:19] what they're responsible for the people
[44:22] of the United States of America right so
[44:24] your husband is responsible for you
[44:26] anyone in a leadership role is
[44:28] responsible for those they are to lead
[44:31] and will answer before God for their
[44:33] role all right so be
[44:36] responsible all right now
[44:40] 29 make sure I'm all right okay now now
[44:44] I think that will get that man and woman
[44:45] now woman is let me get this in right
[44:48] good now this is questions and answers
[44:50] so that you can see it see woman is
[44:52] subject to her husband and the Bible
[44:54] said that a man should rule over his
[44:56] wife but how they've changed that the
[44:58] woman rules over the man now you stay
[45:00] home John you're not going and that
[45:02] settles it yes my dear see let me tell
[45:05] you something Mister you are going to
[45:07] have to answer for your wife but your
[45:09] wife is never going to have to answer
[45:12] for you y you are the head of the woman
[45:14] and God is the head of man therefore he
[45:16] said let the man cut his hair because of
[45:18] Christ and let the woman have her hair
[45:21] for if she cuts her hair she dishonors
[45:23] her husband now what she does she
[45:24] dishonors her husband husband right see
[45:28] what I mean or what the scripture says
[45:30] that really brought that to life to me
[45:32] better I me the only one out of this
[45:34] whole 12 sermon this may be the only
[45:36] Revelation that I
[45:38] got was about this headship of a woman
[45:41] cutting her hair and and a reason why
[45:44] you can't just look at somebody and say
[45:45] don't do this right explain to them why
[45:49] amen same thing with you kids I wanted
[45:50] to kind of get into that Sunday but I
[45:52] didn't have time that's why dad would
[45:54] sit down and he' talked to us explain
[45:56] explains to them why you going to whip
[45:58] them yeah don't just tear them up just
[46:01] explain to them right this is why that
[46:04] we don't do this it's not just cuz I'm
[46:06] daddy now that works a good bit or I'm
[46:09] mama okay that works all right but still
[46:12] you need to kind of sit down and inform
[46:14] them right so they don't do it again and
[46:17] this is why you're getting a whon right
[46:20] cuz you did XYZ and if you do X Y again
[46:22] XYZ again same results is going to
[46:25] happen
[46:26] right all right same way with God God
[46:29] laid that plan right out for us he said
[46:32] if you do this then XYZ is going to
[46:34] happen if you do
[46:35] XYZ same thing is going to happen all
[46:38] right let's go to number
[46:39] 20 or
[46:41] 30 yeah number 30 listen here the man is
[46:45] the ruler this is question AC on Hebrews
[46:48] don't you think you can rule a house
[46:49] talking about the women you're not the
[46:51] ruler of the house you're absolutely
[46:53] you're not a slave now but you're
[46:55] helpmate and Adam the man has to rule
[46:57] over his wife and he's responsible
[47:01] solely now I'm not responsible for for
[47:04] any of your other wies I'm responsible
[47:07] for my wife all right cuz she's one with
[47:10] me amen that's the that's the body God
[47:13] gave me to nurture and govern and be
[47:16] responsible for think about
[47:19] that God makes a man answer for his wife
[47:22] now read and see if God says that now he
[47:26] continues on all right the next
[47:29] part God is still a ruler above man be
[47:35] careful how you
[47:37] men use the role of
[47:40] Ruler all right without Christ in our
[47:43] heart this headship rle can be
[47:45] misused and it will if you don't have
[47:47] Christ in your heart see you won't have
[47:50] enough Christ in you then you're going
[47:51] to be leaning to
[47:53] what emotions of a human being right
[47:57] right we don't want to lean to the
[47:58] Motions of the human being man we want
[48:00] to be what Christlike yeah we want to be
[48:03] Christlike without Christ in our heart
[48:06] this headship Roe can be misused and
[48:08] even
[48:09] abusive swi sisters don't marry somebody
[48:13] that's not a Christian cuz you're going
[48:15] to run into the human part of him
[48:17] eventually usually about a couple months
[48:20] after the
[48:21] honeymoon if that
[48:23] long you'll see the real you yeah right
[48:27] right but if he's a Christian he's got a
[48:31] head right that's right right see how
[48:34] simple this is with a Christian he's got
[48:37] a head already so he's got an answer to
[48:39] him right
[48:41] right and you come under right here and
[48:44] everything's okay but you marry a man
[48:47] that's out here who's his head Satan
[48:51] right period anything outside of this
[48:53] light Christ is what
[48:56] Antichrist all right I'm not saying you
[48:58] married the Antichrist but you may think
[49:01] that in a few
[49:03] months but but if you marry somebody
[49:06] here then you
[49:07] take that headship role reminds
[49:11] us Christian men that we've got somebody
[49:15] that we're answering to which is Christ
[49:18] we're answering now remember he does
[49:20] have to answer for us cuz we're the
[49:22] bride yeah but see remember he's
[49:24] spiritual he molds us and makes us into
[49:27] His Image we can't mold our wives into
[49:30] our own image like he does spiritually
[49:33] to the bride so remember that don't try
[49:34] to make your wife
[49:36] you exactly don't do that you're
[49:39] individual people amen okay we went
[49:43] through that in the U in the dve Ry
[49:45] course we went through it's called a dis
[49:48] d c and it's it's um dominant what's the
[49:53] eye sister rea
[49:56] don't call on me
[49:59] tonight but anyway it tells the the role
[50:02] that you
[50:03] are the characteristics yeah what's the
[50:07] DC d d is dominant of course you know
[50:10] what that done to
[50:12] me put me under the
[50:14] D I always said I was intelligent
[50:17] somebody said idiot but influencing
[50:20] that's D dominant influencing s is
[50:23] stable stable C is and see is compliant
[50:26] so we kind of went through that though
[50:28] and to make my point June was F
[50:34] C and I was d
[50:38] i you said well that's
[50:40] opposite you ever heard the term
[50:42] Opposites
[50:44] Attract if you're both
[50:47] dominant
[50:50] trouble amen amen you both D both is in
[50:55] trouble but a little D and I and a
[50:58] little s and C makes it perfect me and
[51:01] her right yeah that's why we have a good
[51:03] marriage I believe because we compliment
[51:05] each other but that's just something
[51:06] that man has done but God's done the
[51:08] same thing right God's took the role of
[51:11] man and said this is the way you're
[51:12] supposed to be right
[51:14] here women this is the way you're
[51:17] supposed to be right here if you get out
[51:19] of that you're out of the will of God
[51:22] right stay right here right kind of too
[51:26] simple isn't
[51:28] it all right be careful how you men use
[51:30] this role of ruler without Christ in our
[51:32] heart this headship role can be misused
[51:35] and even abused
[51:37] abusive men should do nothing harmful or
[51:39] hurtful do not be a
[51:42] dictator remember the woman is required
[51:44] to be under subjection to the husband as
[51:47] long as he does not go against God's
[51:49] word right that's right if he goes
[51:53] against God's word sisters look what he
[51:54] done look what he done not you or God
[51:57] look what he's done but you're still
[51:59] okay you're right here that's why the
[52:02] Bible says if you can live with an
[52:05] unsaved mate there in what is it
[52:07] Corinthians or somewhere I think Dad
[52:09] read it the other day or somewhere in
[52:11] there if you want to live with them go
[52:12] ahead and live with them you know this
[52:14] is going to happen but sometimes these
[52:15] people can be right right
[52:20] one what did we read there in
[52:22] Peter how that the actions of the woman
[52:25] without saying A word without a
[52:31] conversation can actually convert that
[52:34] man right or vice
[52:38] versa your life that's what I talking
[52:40] about your life right well actually
[52:42] convert that person if you so desire to
[52:45] live where that man says okay you go on
[52:47] to church if you want to Christ is not
[52:49] my head but if you want to stay here and
[52:51] do what God said that's okay is that
[52:54] what Paul said that's okay same way this
[52:57] way right the unbelieving wife can be
[52:59] saved by the believing husband right but
[53:02] still this is there's a problem here
[53:05] this is still out of sorts right
[53:08] okay now let's keep going and we're
[53:10] going to be long time here tonight dwell
[53:13] according to knowledge that's what we
[53:15] read in 1 Peter 3:7 likewise you
[53:18] husbands dwell with them according to
[53:20] knowledge that's what I'm trying to give
[53:21] you in this in this series you men I'm
[53:24] trying to give you the knowledge right
[53:27] not how to bind your wife no this ought
[53:29] to set you free right your sisters it
[53:32] ought to set you really free
[53:34] hey he's my
[53:36] head I have to stay right
[53:39] here we have human problems right here
[53:43] right I mean we're not superp spiritual
[53:46] enough to realize that we're not human
[53:48] right you going to have problems but if
[53:50] you stay right here somewhere it's going
[53:52] to line right back up sure see dwell
[53:55] according to knowledge the male must
[53:57] understand the woman's weaknesses right
[54:00] and dwell according to
[54:01] knowledge likewise ye husbands dwell
[54:04] with them according to knowledge giving
[54:06] honor unto the wife as unto the weaker
[54:09] vessel and as being HS together of the
[54:13] grace of life that your prayers be not
[54:17] hindered right all right let's go to the
[54:19] next
[54:20] one Proverbs 31:10 who can find a
[54:23] virtuous woman
[54:25] did you read that right who can
[54:31] find if you're a godly man you'll find a
[54:33] virtuous
[54:35] woman see who can find a virtuous woman
[54:39] right if you're led by God you'll find a
[54:41] virtuous woman
[54:43] amen gets easier as we go huh for her
[54:46] price is far above rubies and we'll read
[54:48] the rest of that because there's a great
[54:51] right at the very end there's a great uh
[54:53] that's Proverbs 31 10 if you read 11 and
[54:56] 12 it'll really throw this into
[54:58] perspective but we're not going to read
[54:59] till the end Proverbs 12:4 says a
[55:01] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[55:04] but she that maketh ashamed is as
[55:06] rotness in his bones right I'm not going
[55:09] to go
[55:11] there because it it can be you get a
[55:14] woman out from under the headship of God
[55:16] she's anti- word she's got an antichrist
[55:18] Spirit on her amen I'm sorry right
[55:23] you're not under the headship of your
[55:25] husband you have an antichrist Spirit
[55:27] you're rotten this to his
[55:29] bone okay all right let's keep
[55:32] going this is Brother R in his life
[55:34] story so but now a good woman is a jewel
[55:36] in a man's Crown she should be honored
[55:38] see my mother's a woman my wife is and
[55:40] they're lovely now I've got thousands of
[55:42] Christian sisters who I highly respect
[55:45] but if they can respect what God made
[55:47] them a motherhood and a real queen
[55:49] that's all right she's one of the best
[55:51] things that God could give a man was a
[55:53] wife besides salvation a woman is a the
[55:55] best thing if she is a good woman or a
[55:58] good wife but if she isn't Solomon said
[56:01] a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown
[56:02] but an orary one or no good one is
[56:05] watering his blood and that's right it's
[56:07] the worst thing could happen so a good
[56:09] woman if you got a good wife brother you
[56:11] ought to respect her with the highest
[56:14] am amen amen that's right you should do
[56:18] that a real woman and children if you've
[56:20] got a real mother that stays home and
[56:22] tries to take care of you keeping your
[56:24] clothes clean sending you to school
[56:25] teaching you about Jesus you should
[56:27] honor that sweet old mother with all
[56:29] that's in you you should respect that
[56:31] woman yes sir because she's a real
[56:34] mother all right next
[56:38] one here's what we got we rued by the
[56:41] word Hebrews 13:7 this is right before
[56:44] Hebrews 13:8 right remember them which
[56:46] have the rule over you now we talking
[56:49] natural and spiritual here but in
[56:51] natural remember those who have the rule
[56:53] over you who have spoken unto you the
[56:56] word of God now if you as a as a husband
[56:59] do not speak the word of God to the to
[57:01] the wife what's
[57:04] right no rule over you then right
[57:08] right who has spoken unto you the word
[57:10] of God whose Faith
[57:14] follow in other words not just B
[57:16] jangling not just saying hey you got to
[57:18] not do this you got to not do that and
[57:21] he goes and smokes a cigarette behind
[57:22] the corner or he or he don't go to
[57:24] church you come to church or he tells
[57:26] you you got to go to church and he lays
[57:31] out a head here right it's like brother
[57:35] Brown said one time he said as long as
[57:37] I'm King on that Hill my wife's coming
[57:40] to church with
[57:41] me that's what he said he said as long
[57:43] as I'm King on the hill he said that's
[57:45] the way it's going to be he said but if
[57:47] things are ever different he said that's
[57:49] when she's going to
[57:52] go I didn't bring that quote but it's
[57:54] pretty much ver him what he said cuz
[57:56] they were talking about something and he
[57:57] said when I he said Brothers he said
[57:59] when I can't be the king of my of my
[58:01] Palace he said somebody's got to go all
[58:03] right so long as long as my wife's in my
[58:07] household she's going to come to church
[58:09] with
[58:09] me whose Faith follow whose Faith follow
[58:13] you know why she comes to church with me
[58:16] cuz she knows she's going to get
[58:17] something out of the service not cuz I'm
[58:19] up here and not cuz I came with
[58:22] her but she has faith right whose Faith
[58:26] follow what follow the spoken word of
[58:29] God considering the end of their
[58:32] conversation all of us right considering
[58:35] the end of all of our conversation then
[58:37] the next one is Jesus Christ same
[58:38] yesterday today and forever so ruled by
[58:41] the word whys you ruled by the word of
[58:45] God we're all ruled by the word of God
[58:48] you're not ruled by your husband you're
[58:49] ruled by the word of God if he's inside
[58:51] the word of God then you have a ruler
[58:53] called a husband amen but it is the word
[58:56] of God all right everybody understand
[58:58] say amen amen okay all right
[59:01] next and you who claim to be a Son of
[59:03] God where's your principles if the woman
[59:05] ain't out of her place aren't you a Son
[59:07] of God aren't you the one that's a
[59:10] higher stronger vessel as the Bible says
[59:13] she's weaker then if she's weaker then
[59:16] show yourself a man of God yeah tell her
[59:19] say sister you're in the
[59:21] wrong that's right yeah I've done it
[59:25] and other Christians has done it and you
[59:28] will always do it as long as you're a
[59:30] Christian but show yourself right you're
[59:34] a Son of God you you have more power
[59:36] over yourself than the woman does if
[59:39] she's weaker recognize that's what I
[59:41] said recognize her
[59:44] weakness right recognize her to be
[59:47] weaker understand her mistakes and
[59:50] things like that and try to correct her
[59:52] say sister we're Christians
[59:55] shouldn't do that see but a real man be
[59:57] a Son of God and watch the women what is
[59:59] he saying be you be a Son of God and
[1:00:02] watch the women follow behind you right
[1:00:04] right you put yourself in this position
[1:00:07] I don't have to worry about J coming to
[1:00:08] church with me right she's not honoring
[1:00:11] me by coming to church she's honoring
[1:00:13] God but she knows that my faith in
[1:00:14] coming here to get something she's going
[1:00:16] to come here and get something right
[1:00:18] amen same way with any one of us and if
[1:00:20] you're a Son of God be strong be a real
[1:00:22] man if you're not that way stay at the
[1:00:25] altar till you become that and shun the
[1:00:29] very
[1:00:30] appearance of evil all right let's
[1:00:33] go here's the one I like cuz men this is
[1:00:37] what our
[1:00:38] whole this is what everything you can
[1:00:41] you can say well it's govern and it's
[1:00:43] rulership and it's this and that and the
[1:00:45] other but to me this is it right
[1:00:48] here husbands were to be a servant
[1:00:53] leader remember it says honor the wife
[1:00:56] as the weaker vessel right all right a
[1:00:59] servant leader living for others yeah
[1:01:03] live for your spouse right live for your
[1:01:06] wife right husbands love Christ live for
[1:01:10] us didn't he
[1:01:12] righten husbands love your wives even as
[1:01:15] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:01:18] himself there's your servant leader gave
[1:01:21] himself didn't expect anything right
[1:01:24] gave himself right for it Philippians
[1:01:27] 2:37 let nothing be done through Strife
[1:01:30] or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind
[1:01:33] Let each esteem other better than
[1:01:36] themselves
[1:01:39] H let's read that one more time let each
[1:01:43] esteem other better than themselves amen
[1:01:47] look not every man on his own things
[1:01:49] look what I got remember I was talking
[1:01:50] about the selfish thing we still got a
[1:01:52] problem with that yeah
[1:01:55] okay look at me look at what I got look
[1:01:57] at what I can do look at my position
[1:02:00] look not every man on his own things but
[1:02:02] every man also on the things of others
[1:02:07] right that don't mean get in somebody's
[1:02:09] business that don't mean getting in
[1:02:11] somebody else's business you understand
[1:02:13] what that says but every man what look
[1:02:16] in other words brother Dale has to be
[1:02:18] the shepherd of your the flock he has to
[1:02:21] live among you see you're weaknesses cuz
[1:02:25] he's the husband yeah sees your weakness
[1:02:28] as the weaker
[1:02:30] vessel we as the congregation are the
[1:02:33] weaker vessel
[1:02:36] right cuz brother R said if your pastor
[1:02:38] is not preaching the word what get out
[1:02:40] from undering because he's what he head
[1:02:42] Chip's over here he's over here amen go
[1:02:44] find somebody that's over here right all
[1:02:47] right that's why I like to get into the
[1:02:49] spiritual part and maybe do a series on
[1:02:51] that but but maybe some other time I
[1:02:53] want D to start start Revelations 5 he's
[1:02:55] been promising us for a month he needs
[1:02:57] to get into Revelations 5 and do some
[1:02:59] digging let nothing be done but you know
[1:03:01] what if we don't live a life if we don't
[1:03:03] live the life Revelations 5 is going to
[1:03:05] mean nothing to you and me it's not
[1:03:08] going to mean one thing to us if we
[1:03:09] don't make it if you're not filled with
[1:03:12] the Holy Ghost and if you're not the man
[1:03:13] of the house and if you're not doing
[1:03:14] these primer things that God tells us
[1:03:17] about in The Prophet's message not even
[1:03:19] a prophet's message just out of the
[1:03:21] Bible just out of the Bible right then
[1:03:24] don't worry about Revelations 5 that's
[1:03:27] the redeemed that's the ones that did
[1:03:29] things right
[1:03:30] amen right amen exactly right look not
[1:03:33] every man on his own things but every
[1:03:35] man also on the things of others in
[1:03:36] other words I don't sit in the
[1:03:37] congregation and go well this is for me
[1:03:39] no you know what sometimes i s in the
[1:03:41] congregation and go Lord it must be for
[1:03:43] somebody else go this is not hitting me
[1:03:45] I'm not talking about hitting me but I'm
[1:03:46] talking
[1:03:48] about quickening right right right
[1:03:51] brother K we sat here for 40 years and
[1:03:54] you didn't get 2,000 sermons and they
[1:03:57] all got quickened at the same time no
[1:03:59] that's right no brother klie gets a
[1:04:00] little here gets a little there right
[1:04:03] little here right little right that's
[1:04:05] right and you know what I might be
[1:04:07] sitting right there and him sitting
[1:04:08] right here and God just come down and
[1:04:10] reveal something to him and I'm over
[1:04:12] there
[1:04:13] going there's a cobweb over there in the
[1:04:15] corner of the
[1:04:17] church I don't know what we need to
[1:04:19] build on you know brother College over
[1:04:21] there going part on Lord well that's the
[1:04:23] way it is
[1:04:25] okay that's just the way it is but when
[1:04:28] we're up here see we're servant leaders
[1:04:31] every man also on the things of others
[1:04:33] let this mind be watch how Paul goes
[1:04:36] to where it's supposed to start right
[1:04:38] here right let this mind being you which
[1:04:41] all was also in Christ Jesus who being
[1:04:44] in the form of God thought it not
[1:04:45] robbery to be equal with God but made
[1:04:47] himself of no reputation money women and
[1:04:51] popularity yeah kill a preacher right
[1:04:54] money women and popularity popularity is
[1:04:57] selfishness right right but made himself
[1:04:59] of no reputation and took upon him he
[1:05:03] wanted to be took upon him the form of a
[1:05:07] servant right and was made in the
[1:05:09] likeness of men okay so everybody got
[1:05:10] that the servant leader amen men you
[1:05:12] ought to live for your wives cuz you
[1:05:14] going to give account for it you better
[1:05:15] start living with her and nurturing her
[1:05:17] and helping her right right that's just
[1:05:20] not running the vacuum cleaner and the
[1:05:22] and the dishwasher either right
[1:05:25] spiritually we should be helping our
[1:05:27] wives amen as a weaker vessel all right
[1:05:31] let's go to the next one I really
[1:05:34] appreciate our sisters in this church
[1:05:36] because a lot of
[1:05:38] them ask good
[1:05:40] questions there's a lot of these
[1:05:42] questions that you hear up here in the
[1:05:43] pull pit doesn't come from men cuz we
[1:05:45] know
[1:05:49] everything but you know what it comes
[1:05:51] from a lot of
[1:05:53] sisters that doesn't have a spouse
[1:05:55] sitting
[1:05:56] here right cuz they know where their
[1:05:58] headship come from so they know they ask
[1:06:00] the right question they know they can't
[1:06:02] ask their physical husband right that's
[1:06:05] why you remember money women and
[1:06:07] popularity a preacher has to watch out
[1:06:09] for that why because you are the
[1:06:11] spiritual head of that woman sitting
[1:06:12] there with no with no husband so you
[1:06:15] keep your
[1:06:17] distance what daddy said about not going
[1:06:19] don't go in a room with a sister by
[1:06:21] herself cuz that
[1:06:23] pull cuz we are we're the spiritual head
[1:06:26] of that woman if if she doesn't have a
[1:06:27] husband here why you have to be careful
[1:06:31] right be careful it may start as a
[1:06:34] little innocent Bible study and turn
[1:06:36] into something awful you know so amen
[1:06:42] amen come on people we're still humans
[1:06:46] living in a human body right so don't
[1:06:48] tempt that thing all of us any of you if
[1:06:51] a sister come don't don't think wrong of
[1:06:54] the sister but if sister wants to come
[1:06:55] to ask you something don't go off in a
[1:06:57] corner somewhere right that don't look
[1:06:59] good for one and it ain't Godly for the
[1:07:01] other right all right and you need to be
[1:07:04] asking him the questions anyway not
[1:07:06] somebody else all right and as we as CHR
[1:07:09] of course we all want to help I mean I
[1:07:10] don't want dadd to be burdened with all
[1:07:12] everything but but still he's he's our
[1:07:14] head he's the final
[1:07:16] Authority
[1:07:18] right whether you like it or not it's a
[1:07:21] final Authority go find you another
[1:07:22] final Authority if you need one amen and
[1:07:24] we as Christians should always watch
[1:07:26] what we do and what we
[1:07:29] say that we're perfectly honest to every
[1:07:32] man right and you if you can't be honest
[1:07:34] with your fellow man you certainly won't
[1:07:35] be honest with God right so how we serve
[1:07:38] God is we serve each other right how we
[1:07:42] serve God Is How We Serve each other
[1:07:44] right as honest as I would be with you
[1:07:47] that's as honest as I'll be with God and
[1:07:49] that's the same way with you to me we
[1:07:51] must be honest with each other in all of
[1:07:53] our dealings right and somebody is
[1:07:55] watching us you may not think that but
[1:07:57] there's an eye watching you and your
[1:07:59] life is influencing somebody right maybe
[1:08:02] it's a little child and that child May
[1:08:04] grow up to be another fny or moody or so
[1:08:06] forth we don't know but your life is
[1:08:08] influencing someone right so being that
[1:08:11] servant leader living for others but
[1:08:14] remember that others is watching you
[1:08:16] amen all right all right let's
[1:08:19] go nourish and
[1:08:22] cherish Ephesians 5: 28 29 show all men
[1:08:25] to love their wives as their own bodies
[1:08:27] praise the Lord
[1:08:31] right that's what I told him and I'm not
[1:08:34] saying this to be funny but I love the
[1:08:36] body that God gave me she's sitting back
[1:08:39] on the back row amen being a
[1:08:42] grandma but I love the body that God
[1:08:44] gave me cuz she's my body right right
[1:08:47] she's a reflection of me right she does
[1:08:50] a very good job of it so I want men to
[1:08:53] love their wife as their own bodies he
[1:08:55] that loveth his
[1:08:56] wife loveth himself
[1:08:59] amen pretty easy that's why I love
[1:09:03] me I don't care whether you do or not
[1:09:06] God loves me my wife loves me so what's
[1:09:09] your
[1:09:11] problem he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:09:14] himself for no man ever hated his own
[1:09:17] flesh if she's bone of my bone and Flesh
[1:09:20] of My
[1:09:22] Flesh I can't hate
[1:09:24] I'm talking about my wife I can't hate
[1:09:26] her right but no man ever yet hated his
[1:09:28] own flesh same way with God because
[1:09:30] we're what bone
[1:09:33] of Christ amen bone and flesh of his
[1:09:38] flesh
[1:09:39] right for no man ever yet hated his own
[1:09:42] flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it
[1:09:46] even as the Lord the church now the word
[1:09:49] cherish means to treasure value greatly
[1:09:54] nourish means to nurture or help alone
[1:09:56] remember we kind of went through the
[1:09:57] nurturing part with the kid how to
[1:09:59] cultivate the crop same way with husband
[1:10:01] and wife growing up okay nourishes and
[1:10:04] cherishes let's get finished right here
[1:10:06] this will be the role of the ma of the
[1:10:08] male and Colossians 2:19 and not holding
[1:10:11] the head from which all the body by
[1:10:13] joints and bands have
[1:10:14] nourishment having nourishment
[1:10:18] ministered yeah right here yeah this
[1:10:21] where you get your nourishment right
[1:10:22] here amen nourishment Minister and knit
[1:10:26] together increases with the increase of
[1:10:30] God Amen not man right increases with
[1:10:35] the increase of God in other words God
[1:10:37] will give you increase if you nourish
[1:10:41] and knit together your body but if any
[1:10:45] First Timothy but if any provide not for
[1:10:48] his own and especially for those of his
[1:10:50] own house he ha denied the
[1:10:55] faith y'all want to read that and it's
[1:10:58] worse than an
[1:11:00] Infidel he has denied the faith
[1:11:05] amen come on people right and is worse
[1:11:09] than an
[1:11:10] Infidel all right let's read the last
[1:11:12] quote right here for the
[1:11:15] man I know th propy but they aren't Rich
[1:11:18] there it is again see him walking up
[1:11:20] down the midst of the church like a
[1:11:22] father he is looking down upon his
[1:11:23] family he is the head of his household
[1:11:25] he is the provider he is the protector
[1:11:28] now brother R was talking about God but
[1:11:29] I thought I'd put this in here for us to
[1:11:31] do the same thing you and I are what the
[1:11:35] father over the family you're the head
[1:11:36] of the household you're the provider
[1:11:38] you're the protector talking about you
[1:11:40] men but God is same way with us yet he
[1:11:43] looks on at their poverty oh how the
[1:11:46] untutored believer stumbles at this how
[1:11:50] can God bear to look upon his own in a
[1:11:52] time of need and not just stop it all
[1:11:55] just give in and lavish everything
[1:11:57] material upon them so headship is
[1:12:00] established by being what a Godly leader
[1:12:02] amen you can't be the head if you're not
[1:12:04] the leader
[1:12:06] right right amen can't be the head
[1:12:08] unless you're the leader right all right
[1:12:10] so let's take our leadership role
[1:12:15] man and nurture our house right cherish
[1:12:18] our body nourish our body right what if
[1:12:22] your wife has a need she's to come to
[1:12:24] you first
[1:12:25] right right right come to you first and
[1:12:28] if you can't handle in a Godly manner
[1:12:31] she needs to go and find a deacon or go
[1:12:33] and find somebody that's why the deacons
[1:12:35] are
[1:12:36] given to protect the widows and the
[1:12:38] orphans cuz the Widow don't have a head
[1:12:40] except for Christ right so in the
[1:12:43] church in the church the deacons are to
[1:12:45] take care of the widows and orphans
[1:12:46] right okay I mean that's just the way
[1:12:48] God God's got this thing laid out
[1:12:50] perfect we just get it like this all the
[1:12:52] time yeah
[1:12:54] you know scatter all this out but but
[1:12:56] now let's talk about the the female the
[1:12:58] woman
[1:12:59] female rooll of the female all right
[1:13:02] we're not going to read well let's read
[1:13:03] yeah let's read hold on let's read the
[1:13:05] first first couple of verses cuz this is
[1:13:08] this is specifically in this chap in
[1:13:10] this verse this is to the Fe to the
[1:13:12] woman yeah right all right likewise you
[1:13:15] wise being subjection to your own
[1:13:20] husband that if if any obey what if
[1:13:28] any that if any husband obey not the
[1:13:32] word that's what it says right I'm not
[1:13:33] trying to move the word or add to or
[1:13:35] take away right amen cuz that's what it
[1:13:37] says that if any obey who they talking
[1:13:39] about if any husband right obey not the
[1:13:42] word they also May without the
[1:13:46] word without going bless God this is it
[1:13:49] right here without that can be won by
[1:13:52] the convers ation right of the
[1:13:56] W while they behold your Chase
[1:13:59] conversation coupled with fear all right
[1:14:03] now that's not fear like Adam had that's
[1:14:04] but the fear of God all right who
[1:14:07] adorning let it not be that outward
[1:14:08] adorning or planting of hair wearing of
[1:14:10] gold and putting on a perel you know why
[1:14:12] you can do all that still now and go to
[1:14:13] hell right exactly that's right but you
[1:14:16] can't do this and die and go to hell
[1:14:19] right verse four but let it be the
[1:14:22] hidden man of the heart right
[1:14:24] because the hidden man of the heart is
[1:14:25] going to bring all that out right all
[1:14:27] right can't get a holy ghost F woman to
[1:14:29] Bob her hair you can't get a holy ghost
[1:14:30] F woman to U wear pants or or wear
[1:14:34] things or makeup you can't you can't get
[1:14:36] her to do it why it's not in her right
[1:14:40] go but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:14:42] heart and that which is not corruptible
[1:14:45] the only thing is Incorruptible and
[1:14:46] that's the word of God right even the
[1:14:48] ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit
[1:14:50] which is in the sight of God of great
[1:14:52] price for after this manner in the old
[1:14:54] times the holy
[1:14:56] women sisters you ought to shout it says
[1:14:59] holy women right it's always talking
[1:15:02] about the holy man and not it said the
[1:15:04] holy women right H why because you did
[1:15:08] these things in that order for after
[1:15:12] this manner what after this manner yeah
[1:15:18] after you do all this right but for M
[1:15:21] for after this manner in the Old Times
[1:15:24] Holy Women also who trusted in God
[1:15:27] adorned them themselves being a
[1:15:28] subjection unto their own husbands in
[1:15:30] other words they got in their position
[1:15:32] right even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[1:15:35] calling him Lord whose daughters you are
[1:15:36] as long as you do well and are not
[1:15:38] afraid with any amazement right in other
[1:15:41] words it doesn't surprise
[1:15:43] you all right likewise your husbands
[1:15:46] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:15:48] giving honor unto the wife to the weaker
[1:15:50] vessel and as being HS together not SE
[1:15:53] separate together of the grace of life
[1:15:56] this is our problem people our prayers
[1:15:59] are hindered yeah because we're not in
[1:16:01] our right position right all right now
[1:16:05] remember all right let's
[1:16:13] go let me go back one
[1:16:15] here remember the double
[1:16:18] Covenant unto the woman he said I will
[1:16:20] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:16:22] conception this is your role now and
[1:16:24] sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children
[1:16:26] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:16:28] and he shall rule over thee right you
[1:16:30] remember we talked about the double
[1:16:32] Covenant right all right let's go to the
[1:16:33] next one now the woman female wife
[1:16:36] whatever you want to call it needs to
[1:16:38] know what God expects of her her husband
[1:16:41] needs to understand her role also so you
[1:16:43] Brothers you don't have to turn the tape
[1:16:45] off and go to sleep and sit back and
[1:16:47] think well I've got it made
[1:16:49] no remember you got to answer for her so
[1:16:52] you better know what her actions is
[1:16:53] whether they good or bad right right
[1:16:56] right the male is told to dwell with her
[1:16:58] according to knowledge amen the men
[1:17:00] should take as many notes as the female
[1:17:02] because a man is responsible for her
[1:17:04] actions and as a leader her head it is
[1:17:07] your
[1:17:08] role to help her correct her action
[1:17:10] right she can't correct them on her own
[1:17:12] all the time cuz she's the weaker vessel
[1:17:15] all right remember you will
[1:17:18] answer husbands you'll answer for your
[1:17:22] wife's
[1:17:23] action
[1:17:30] right so you better pay attention to
[1:17:33] what your wife's doing all right let's
[1:17:35] go Genesis 2:18 and the Lord said Lord
[1:17:38] God said it is not good that the man
[1:17:40] should be alone I will make him and help
[1:17:43] me for him all right First
[1:17:46] Corinthians every man prophesying or Pro
[1:17:49] praying or prophesying having his head
[1:17:51] covered dishonor his head all right here
[1:17:53] we go with the scripture but every woman
[1:17:55] that prayeth or prophesies with her head
[1:17:57] uncovered dishonor her head that is not
[1:18:01] her natural head that's on her shoulders
[1:18:04] right amen right that's not talking

[1:18:08] shoulders that's talking about the guy
[1:18:10] that's sitting beside you tonight your
[1:18:13] head huh dishonor her
[1:18:17] head that's why brother Brown said you

[1:18:22] another headship right you can't marry
[1:18:24] again right but if she moves over here
[1:18:26] and takes another headship you can
[1:18:28] divorce her yeah right cuz really what
[1:18:30] she's done is she's committed
[1:18:32] fornication yeah she's being with
[1:18:35] another husband yeah amen right she's
[1:18:39] being with another husband that makes
[1:18:41] her unclean right now she's got to pray
[1:18:45] ask God to forgive her come back over
[1:18:47] here it's not back like this right it's
[1:18:51] left you you can't come back and say
[1:18:53] well bless God I've been forgiven now I
[1:18:55] can tell you what to do that's what
[1:18:58] woman has done in
[1:19:01] preaching that's why a woman can't
[1:19:03] preach same thing not just cuz she can't
[1:19:06] preach cuz she's done what arship
[1:19:09] authority over her head right and the
[1:19:13] scripture can't be broke right in
[1:19:15] Genesis it said you must be the ruler
[1:19:17] and the wife be down here amen all right
[1:19:20] for if the woman be not covered what say
[1:19:23] she need to be shaven for if the woman
[1:19:25] be not covered let her also be shorn but
[1:19:27] if she be but if it be a shame for a
[1:19:29] woman to be Shor or shaven let her be
[1:19:31] covered for a man indeed ought not to
[1:19:33] cover his head for as much as he is the
[1:19:35] image and glory of God but the woman is
[1:19:37] the glory of the
[1:19:40] man so you cut your hair you come out
[1:19:42] under the glory of the man out from
[1:19:44] under the glory of the man what in other
[1:19:46] words you come out from under the
[1:19:48] protection right come on right cut your
[1:19:52] hair you're out from under anything
[1:19:54] right you can't be under God right
[1:19:57] you're under Satan right but the woman
[1:20:00] is the glory of the man for the man is
[1:20:02] not of the woman but the woman of the
[1:20:03] man neither was the Man created for the
[1:20:06] woman but the woman for the man for this
[1:20:08] cause ought the woman to have power on
[1:20:11] her head this is her natural head
[1:20:13] because of the Angels she not have a
[1:20:15] power over us no right she has to have
[1:20:18] power on her head because of the Angels
[1:20:20] now looked up that Angels brother BR
[1:20:22] said those angels
[1:20:23] were men yeah there's no female angel
[1:20:27] right so you have power over her head
[1:20:30] because of the men right what the men
[1:20:34] Messengers The Men Angels cuz if you
[1:20:37] don't if you cut your hair you're
[1:20:38] Earthship in power
[1:20:40] over man or the angels I didn't bring
[1:20:44] that quote but it's back there somewhere
[1:20:45] where brother talks about angels
[1:20:47] somebody asked him about that and he
[1:20:48] said the Angels is men there's never
[1:20:50] been a woman Angel right EX what a man
[1:20:53] so it's because of the men is a reason
[1:20:55] you don't catch your hair cuz the man's
[1:20:57] here you're here right you're not have
[1:20:59] to have power over your headship right
[1:21:02] all right because of the angels all
[1:21:05] right let's go
[1:21:07] 159 now here this is this is the quote
[1:21:10] here now a woman is not meant to have an
[1:21:12] iron disposition she is according to the
[1:21:15] holy scriptures now this is not
[1:21:16] somebody's idea this is according to the
[1:21:17] word of God she is to be submissive to
[1:21:20] the male that is Comm demanded of her
[1:21:23] woman who is truly female all female
[1:21:25] will be of that disposition not a
[1:21:27] doormat no real male makes a female a
[1:21:29] doormat but she will want to be under
[1:21:32] will want to be under Authority and not
[1:21:35] rule over the man for he is the head of
[1:21:37] the house if she breaks that image that
[1:21:40] God made for
[1:21:42] her she's perverted right any male that
[1:21:46] well here we
[1:21:48] go any male that lets the woman take
[1:21:51] authority has also broken that image and
[1:21:54] he's
[1:21:58] perverted
[1:21:59] wow he's perverted why cuz you got to
[1:22:02] answer for her right you let her
[1:22:04] continue what she's doing it perverts
[1:22:06] you right that is why a woman cannot
[1:22:10] wear that which pertaineth to a man or
[1:22:12] cut her hair cuz why she URS Authority
[1:22:15] above the man if she does that when she
[1:22:17] does she is intruding into the male
[1:22:20] domain right taking Authority and
[1:22:24] perverting herself and when a woman
[1:22:26] invades the pull pit which is commanded
[1:22:28] she must not do she shows what P Spirit
[1:22:30] she is of being a dominating female is
[1:22:34] Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman
[1:22:36] Catholic Church are in her though she
[1:22:38] may deny it ever so vinant but when it
[1:22:42] comes to the word of God let God be true
[1:22:44] and every man's word be a lie amen all
[1:22:47] right so that one kind of covers
[1:22:48] everything now let's read a few notes we
[1:22:50] got about 10 minutes because she was
[1:22:53] made for man and because of the Angels
[1:22:55] the woman is to have long hair it is
[1:22:57] assigned to God and man she is under
[1:23:00] man's Authority right that's why
[1:23:03] everybody started cutting their hair
[1:23:04] they come out from under the authority
[1:23:05] of God and man right and started
[1:23:09] perverting look what this is all
[1:23:11] perverted World why women started
[1:23:13] cutting their
[1:23:15] hair she is under man's Authority
[1:23:17] outside of that they're
[1:23:20] perverted your LGH ha show
[1:23:23] it's a sign to God and man that you have
[1:23:26] subjected yourself you have given
[1:23:29] everything you have to God and to your
[1:23:32] husband right amen and she is under
[1:23:34] man's Authority outside of that they're
[1:23:36] perverted yeah not unless the woman sees
[1:23:39] or understands you got to see it sisters
[1:23:41] you got to understand that you're made
[1:23:44] for the
[1:23:45] man it is more difficult for the wife to
[1:23:48] truly be happy and a submissive role if
[1:23:50] you don't understand right in other
[1:23:52] words if you don't understand this if
[1:23:54] it's just dos and don'ts like we come
[1:23:56] all come up under yeah do this don't do
[1:23:59] that but if you put it in the word of
[1:24:00] God like I'm doing it and showing the
[1:24:02] headship right you see that there's your
[1:24:05] role stay in it unless the woman sees or
[1:24:09] understands that she is made for the man
[1:24:11] it is more difficult in other words
[1:24:14] you'll be rebellious in other words
[1:24:15] you'll be what you'll want to URS of
[1:24:17] authority over a man cuz you think he
[1:24:18] ain't got no business telling you what
[1:24:20] to do right well if he tells you the
[1:24:22] word of God it's not him telling you
[1:24:24] that right it's God in him telling you
[1:24:27] that all right that she's made for the
[1:24:29] man it's more difficult for the wife to
[1:24:31] truly be happy cuz I've seen it you've
[1:24:33] seen it in a marriage relationship in a
[1:24:36] message women come into the message and
[1:24:38] and men treat them like dogs and make do
[1:24:41] this and don't do that they're not happy
[1:24:44] they're not happy right cuz they don't
[1:24:47] understand right they've just been told
[1:24:49] to do this told to do that exactly
[1:24:54] well if you'll sit down and explain to
[1:24:55] them cuz she's a weaker vessel she's the
[1:24:57] one that goes by the emotional part you
[1:25:00] have to tell me
[1:25:04] why cuz you're the weaker vessel I'm
[1:25:06] talking about the woman you're the
[1:25:07] weaker vessel do you have to say you
[1:25:09] have to tell me you're my head tell me
[1:25:12] tell me why all right let's go we're not
[1:25:16] going Ephesians 5:22 wives submit
[1:25:19] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[1:25:21] unto
[1:25:22] the Lord no the wife is given the
[1:25:25] responsibility to carry out God's plan
[1:25:27] as a suitable helpmate see you're part
[1:25:28] of the plan you're not just you know
[1:25:31] brother Brown say dog meet and all that
[1:25:32] stuff but remember he said a virtuous
[1:25:35] woman Jewel in a man's Crown right what
[1:25:38] but she you're given a responsibility to
[1:25:40] carry out God's plan as a suitable
[1:25:42] helpmate so you are part of the plan
[1:25:45] yeah her responsibility is to be
[1:25:47] complimentary to her M right to submit
[1:25:51] means to give over or yield to the power
[1:25:53] or authority of
[1:25:55] another suitable when you talking about
[1:25:57] suitable help me appropriate fitting
[1:26:02] becoming complimentary I've talked about
[1:26:08] accessoriz she's an accessory she's a
[1:26:11] help
[1:26:12] me
[1:26:15] right complimentary an expression of
[1:26:18] Praise Commendation an award
[1:26:22] or an admiration right right what are we
[1:26:25] to
[1:26:26] Christ we're a reward yes sir to him
[1:26:30] right right we're his victory right amen
[1:26:33] right we're his glory you know those
[1:26:35] clothes brother Brown said we're his
[1:26:36] victory we're his glory right why
[1:26:39] because he comes becomes
[1:26:42] submissive to not his own will but he
[1:26:44] wanted us to partake in his life that's
[1:26:47] what I want June June to partake in my
[1:26:49] life but I want it to be a Godly life
[1:26:52] I don't want to be in some junk right
[1:26:55] but complimentary your your wives you
[1:26:57] should be complimentary to your husband
[1:26:59] an expression of Praise or
[1:27:02] Commendation now calling him stupid in a
[1:27:05] crowd is not being complimentary that's
[1:27:08] not a
[1:27:09] compliment remember what I told you have
[1:27:12] your arguments at
[1:27:14] home okay cuz you're going to all you
[1:27:16] have me home yeah all right but you got
[1:27:19] to remember you still got to come back
[1:27:20] to this
[1:27:22] yeah right here H you all right let's
[1:27:28] go and the time had come for Abraham the
[1:27:31] great patriarch and servant of God to
[1:27:34] make a
[1:27:36] decision and this decision was that he
[1:27:38] would decided just on his own son Isaac
[1:27:40] that he'd waited 25 years for and had
[1:27:42] received him as one from the dead and
[1:27:44] know that he was a called and separated
[1:27:46] messenger of God and there was a time
[1:27:48] come when he had to make the decision
[1:27:50] who would be his helpmate to carry out
[1:27:52] the plan of God remember Abraham he
[1:27:54] messed up cuz he went to Hagar thought
[1:27:56] he was going to fulfill the plan with
[1:27:57] the Earth that wasn't the right one God
[1:27:59] told him it had to be through who Sarah
[1:28:02] his wife you see God don't make all of
[1:28:04] our
[1:28:06] decisions right he doesn't that's right
[1:28:09] we're free moral agents we have
[1:28:11] decisions we make but if we'll go
[1:28:13] through the process of of praying and
[1:28:16] just like the praying and looking and
[1:28:19] you know and all that the planning and
[1:28:20] praying and looking that's in your
[1:28:22] Christian Life too people it's not just
[1:28:24] people looking for a for a natural mate
[1:28:27] to go through life in no that's that's
[1:28:29] the life with God you might got to plan
[1:28:32] things you got to look at things you see
[1:28:34] God don't make all of our decisions
[1:28:35] there's many times that God doesn't tell
[1:28:37] us prophets just what to
[1:28:39] do because they have to make the
[1:28:42] decision remember the remember the
[1:28:44] prophecy by Danny Henry he said it was
[1:28:46] the way you chose right God didn't say I
[1:28:50] chose this for you William brandom that
[1:28:53] would be God putting you through a tube
[1:28:54] and pulling you through it God's not
[1:28:57] like that he gave the prophet a choice
[1:28:59] he said because of the choice you made a
[1:29:01] greater portion of Heaven that's what he
[1:29:02] said right here doesn't tell these
[1:29:04] prophets just what to do cuz they have
[1:29:05] to make the decision there's no decision
[1:29:07] that we have to make just wait every
[1:29:09] move on God then there's no over
[1:29:11] overcoming on our part exactly and
[1:29:14] sometimes they make the wrong decision
[1:29:16] God an God's anointed prophets makes the
[1:29:18] wrong decisions and many times they're
[1:29:20] dece right
[1:29:22] we got to pray all right let's go to the
[1:29:25] next one going to run out of time I help
[1:29:28] Med is to be
[1:29:30] involved that's why I like this course
[1:29:32] that we're doing with with the financial
[1:29:35] peace it's
[1:29:36] involved you know you'll hear some of
[1:29:38] the testimony boy and Janet they they
[1:29:40] come closer together because they
[1:29:42] everything's involved yeah I I don't I
[1:29:46] don't I'm the head of my house but you
[1:29:48] know what I don't want to rule over
[1:29:51] everything
[1:29:52] yeah jun's got her little rulership
[1:29:54] she's got brother mown told her over the
[1:29:56] children things of the of the running of
[1:29:59] the household and stuff like that that's
[1:30:00] not my
[1:30:01] job but my decisions are up here and
[1:30:05] she's here making the decisions that she
[1:30:07] Mak that's why you're not supposed to be
[1:30:09] a um a
[1:30:11] dictator dictator makes every decision
[1:30:14] every move you make you got to no you
[1:30:16] never have to come in the morning and
[1:30:17] say hey honey what do you want me to do
[1:30:20] today no
[1:30:23] I just read you we make decision right
[1:30:26] but the help me is to be involved with
[1:30:28] whatever God has called her husband to
[1:30:31] do here's where I think the importance
[1:30:33] of the role of the wife comes into view
[1:30:35] to do two things support and understand
[1:30:39] her mate support means to Bear hold up
[1:30:42] maintain sustain under trial under trial
[1:30:46] that doesn't sustain while we're having
[1:30:48] a
[1:30:49] party that says trial
[1:30:55] understand means to perceive the meaning
[1:30:56] of like I said to see to see means to
[1:31:00] understand to perceive the meaning of to
[1:31:01] be thoroughly familiar with what I'm
[1:31:04] trying to get you men to be thoroughly
[1:31:07] familiar with your wife and your wife to
[1:31:09] be thoroughly familiar with your husband
[1:31:11] we we we think we're so spiritual that
[1:31:14] we got to be so involved and we got to
[1:31:16] know everything about God and don't know
[1:31:17] a thing about our
[1:31:20] wife don't know a thing about our
[1:31:22] husband yeah primary things brother Bram
[1:31:25] said
[1:31:26] ABCs get the ABCs right then let's work
[1:31:30] on going out the statue of a perfect man
[1:31:33] together all right now let's
[1:31:36] go possessing all things brother said
[1:31:39] and Abraham as we understood wasn't any
[1:31:41] special person in the side of the world
[1:31:43] and otherwise he wasn't a king or a
[1:31:44] monarch you remember that Abraham was a
[1:31:46] king he wasn't a potentate he wasn't
[1:31:48] somebody that everybody looked up to God
[1:31:50] just said hey Abraham follow me yeah
[1:31:52] right he was just a man and he had
[1:31:54] married his half sister which was Sarah
[1:31:56] and probably married her when she was a
[1:31:57] young woman and God had called him at
[1:32:00] the age of 75 to a life of service and
[1:32:03] it also included his helpmate right and
[1:32:08] right here we could start I believe that
[1:32:09] when God calls a man to service if he's
[1:32:12] a married man and he has a helpmate he
[1:32:14] calls his wife with him because they two
[1:32:16] are one so wherever we find
[1:32:20] later that's hard to follow and so
[1:32:23] wherever we find later on that God Poss
[1:32:27] possibly would have killed Sarah when
[1:32:28] she died of the Angel's message 25 years
[1:32:30] later when they were sending on the oak
[1:32:32] tree that day but when she laughed when
[1:32:34] the angel told her or told Abraham she's
[1:32:36] going to be mother and Sarah laughed
[1:32:37] within herself said how could I old how
[1:32:39] could I old 90 years old and her husband
[1:32:42] 100 her womb dried up for years body as
[1:32:44] good as dead then how could she ever
[1:32:46] have pleasure with her husband again and
[1:32:47] she laughed at herself and the angel
[1:32:49] with his back turned to the tent said
[1:32:50] why is sah laugh and she denied it now
[1:32:53] that's telling God to his face that he's
[1:32:55] wrong see and that would have took her
[1:32:57] life but God could not take Sarah
[1:32:58] because she was part of Abraham see and
[1:33:00] she was in the Covenant with him amen
[1:33:04] when he was circumcised she was
[1:33:06] circumcised with him
[1:33:08] right so she had to go with him she
[1:33:11] could so he God could not take Abraham
[1:33:14] or take Sarah without taking part of
[1:33:16] Abraham for these two are one amen all
[1:33:19] right now Titus 2 3 for the Aged woman
[1:33:23] likewise that they be in
[1:33:25] Behavior as becoming Holiness not false
[1:33:29] accusers not giving them much wine
[1:33:31] teachers of good things that they may
[1:33:33] teach the younger women to be sober to
[1:33:35] love their husbands to love their
[1:33:37] children to be discreet chased keepers
[1:33:40] at home good obedient to their own
[1:33:42] husband that's what you older sisters
[1:33:44] should be teaching the younger sister to
[1:33:46] be discreet chase keep it at home good
[1:33:48] obedient to own husband that the word of
[1:33:50] God
[1:33:52] be not blasphemed
[1:33:54] right that the word of God be not
[1:33:57] blasphemed wow pretty powerful huh all
[1:34:00] right let's
[1:34:02] go Proverbs 31:10 who can find a
[1:34:05] virtuous woman we're going to read this
[1:34:06] again for her price is far above rubies
[1:34:08] 31:27 she lookth well to the ways of her
[1:34:11] household and eateth not the bread right
[1:34:16] of
[1:34:17] idleness idle mind is what the devil's
[1:34:20] workshop amen all right so we're going
[1:34:23] to skip right here um we're going to
[1:34:26] read this one and then I'm going to
[1:34:28] skip uh women working because you know
[1:34:31] you are you fill that out for yourself

[1:34:49] we know that to be the truth you'll
[1:34:51] never find I know that sounds
[1:34:52] oldfashioned but I'm responsible what he
[1:34:55] was responsible for his body he was
[1:34:58] teaching a body of Believers right he
[1:35:01] was responsible for that body and I know
[1:35:03] that after my going away from this Earth
[1:35:05] them tapes and them books will be living
[1:35:07] on and many of you young children will
[1:35:09] find in the days to come that this is
[1:35:11] exactly the truth so it's not
[1:35:13] oldfashioned right this is exactly the
[1:35:16] truth because I speak it in the name of
[1:35:18] the Lord all right let's go to the next
[1:35:20] one man you will not be known by how
[1:35:25] successful you are in business or in a
[1:35:27] profession but you'll be known by how
[1:35:30] you fulfill your scriptural position and
[1:35:32] responsibility
[1:35:35] ex you're not going to be setting up in
[1:35:37] glory and get a a a a blue ribbon for
[1:35:42] making the most money in
[1:35:45] life no the Bible says we come here with
[1:35:50] nothing and we leave with nothing but
[1:35:53] our character
[1:35:55] right and that's developed from the time
[1:35:58] we're born now right so don't you know
[1:36:02] sure we need to make money we need to do
[1:36:04] good in business we ought to be the most
[1:36:07] outstanding of business people or or
[1:36:09] whatever possession profession we should
[1:36:11] be the most outstanding but you're only
[1:36:13] going to be known how you fulfill your
[1:36:15] POS scriptural position and
[1:36:17] responsibilities in life all
[1:36:19] right let's go to
[1:36:22] the next one and I'll tell you the
[1:36:24] scroll through cuz it talks about women
[1:36:26] working and all that stuff you know if
[1:36:28] brother sick or or anything like that
[1:36:30] when I've told you
[1:36:32] before your place is really at
[1:36:36] home right that's right the place is
[1:36:39] really a
[1:36:41] home that's exactly where they should be
[1:36:44] all right keep going to the next one
[1:36:46] just going to paraphrase
[1:36:48] here see look wonder if woman are
[1:36:50] willing to let your hair grow out wonder
[1:36:51] if you men have got enough courage to
[1:36:53] tell her
[1:36:54] that you're supposed to be the head of
[1:36:56] the house she's the neck she turns you
[1:36:59] that's contrary yeah do you think a
[1:37:02] shaking Revival will ever take these
[1:37:04] women out of these public offices
[1:37:06] policemen on the street and things she
[1:37:07] ought to be in the kitchen you think
[1:37:09] you'd ever be able to get her back at
[1:37:11] that again no sir she'll never do it cuz
[1:37:14] she's cuz listen no sir she'll never do
[1:37:18] it unless she gets
[1:37:19] saved then she do it right right you
[1:37:23] won't have to tell her nothing about it
[1:37:25] she'll find her place the Holy Ghost
[1:37:27] will lead her to her place right but say
[1:37:29] the Holy Ghost is leading me to that
[1:37:31] contrary to the word don't call that the
[1:37:34] Holy Ghost right all right now go the
[1:37:38] next one we'll skip it now no the why
[1:37:41] her position is to be The Keeper of the
[1:37:42] home support her husband and children
[1:37:44] and compliment the family by keeping the
[1:37:47] home clean and in order jobs outside the
[1:37:49] home takes a wife away from her
[1:37:50] scriptural position sorry if the wife
[1:37:53] can do both okay but if women working in
[1:37:56] an office or professional environment
[1:37:58] cannot always put her husband or
[1:37:59] children first they
[1:38:02] can't you can't always do that yeah and
[1:38:05] I've seen why these quotes are true in
[1:38:07] my past experience talking about me in
[1:38:08] the workplace the devil not only works
[1:38:11] on a female to disrupt the home but he
[1:38:12] will give the man so many things to do
[1:38:15] that he is never home yeah heard a kid
[1:38:18] tell me yesterday we were talking
[1:38:19] something and something was said and he
[1:38:21] said well my dad's never home that's
[1:38:24] pretty shameful they should both cherish
[1:38:26] the home life and be on the same page
[1:38:30] when balancing work and home so get
[1:38:32] together husband and wife career path
[1:38:34] should be discussed before marriage or
[1:38:38] even now all right so everybody
[1:38:41] understand that woman's position is
[1:38:43] supposed to be at home supporting a
[1:38:45] husband complimenting the family not
[1:38:47] complimenting your boss or supporting
[1:38:48] your boss that's not your job sorry I
[1:38:52] didn't make the rules but what happens
[1:38:59] is you're you're if you take yourself
[1:39:01] out of this position you're over here
[1:39:04] pleasing someone
[1:39:05] else I've seen it happen many times
[1:39:08] people in my own
[1:39:10] experience women you dress the best when
[1:39:13] you go to
[1:39:17] work you dress the best when you go to
[1:39:20] work you don't go into work with curlers
[1:39:22] and your house coat on yeah you dress
[1:39:25] the best you look your best you smell
[1:39:28] the best and you take all your problems
[1:39:31] to work and you start talking to a male
[1:39:35] about your problems and you start
[1:39:37] getting close and close I've seen it
[1:39:41] with my own eyes you get close and
[1:39:45] close why he's receptive to listen when
[1:39:49] you go home
[1:39:51] husband may not be recepted he may be
[1:39:53] asleep on the couch and wake up and say
[1:39:56] where's my
[1:39:57] supper this guy's receptive so then
[1:40:00] relationships start that's why brother
[1:40:02] Brown was so against it people that's
[1:40:04] why he was so against it right women
[1:40:06] working cuz he said he saw it in offices
[1:40:08] and stuff people coming in in the in the
[1:40:11] uh discernment he say many times he say
[1:40:14] I could tell you a lot of things about
[1:40:15] how these women what happens in offices
[1:40:18] right right all right let's go finish
[1:40:20] that it's 5 minutes afterno I'm sorry
[1:40:22] but I got to finish this all right keep
[1:40:26] going
[1:40:30] next surely that's not it thank
[1:40:34] you because he wants you to be a real
[1:40:36] housewife he wants you to reflect your
[1:40:38] influence upon another person the
[1:40:40] battery we got to get some new
[1:40:42] batteries but this one is one that was
[1:40:45] charged since
[1:40:48] Sunday somebody is watching your life
[1:40:51] you're influencing somebody God has to
[1:40:53] have a real what
[1:40:55] housewife huh is it not the
[1:40:59] battery it's but
[1:41:03] it's
[1:41:05] oh anyway can you hear me now okay all
[1:41:10] right let's go past that quote cuz I
[1:41:12] want to get to the end this is what I
[1:41:13] want you sisters to see right here keep
[1:41:16] going go to the next quote please savior
[1:41:18] or preserver remember while submit
[1:41:20] yourself to your own husband as unto the
[1:41:21] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[1:41:23] house even as Christ is the head of the
[1:41:25] church for he is the savior of the body
[1:41:27] right therefore as the church is subject
[1:41:29] unto Christ so let the wise so
[1:41:32] as as the church is subject unto
[1:41:36] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:41:38] husbands in
[1:41:40] everything amen cuz remember he's the
[1:41:44] Savior or preserver of the body which is
[1:41:46] you all right now let's go to the next
[1:41:49] one verse one tells us that a woman who
[1:41:52] has a husband that doesn't obey the word
[1:41:54] is to win him by the testimony we're
[1:41:55] back to First Peter by the testimony of
[1:41:59] her life she lives in front of him not
[1:42:01] by preaching or teaching or correcting
[1:42:03] him it is to be without the word right
[1:42:06] actions speak louder than words living a
[1:42:09] genuine Christian Life with a Meek and
[1:42:10] quiet spirit is a great price to God
[1:42:12] that's what he said there an ornament
[1:42:14] means adorning so what you put on in
[1:42:17] sincerity to your husband is powerful
[1:42:19] right right
[1:42:21] all right it's powerful now let's skip
[1:42:24] the quotes let's get down to Proverbs go
[1:42:26] all the way down to Proverbs 3110
[1:42:29] through2 cuz we wor we've read Proverbs
[1:42:32] 31:10 so just shake yourself for a
[1:42:34] minute we'll be finished who can find a
[1:42:36] virtuous woman for a price is far above
[1:42:38] rubies now we stopped and not read that
[1:42:41] on purpose cuz I want to leave this for
[1:42:42] the last listen to this the heart of her

[1:42:49] her so that he shall have no need of
[1:42:53] spoil right amen amen she will do him
[1:42:57] good and not evil all the days of her
[1:43:02] life

[1:43:06] sisters who can find a virtuous woman
[1:43:09] for her price is far above Ruby right
[1:43:11] the heart of her
[1:43:13] husband does safely trust in
[1:43:16] her so that he shall have no need of
[1:43:19] spoil right in other words no need of
