hurting and all all of the different ones Among Us that are sick just touch each one Let Your Love be made manifest in guide us in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 3 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady oans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness and who is he the beginning of the creation of God and who are we the rest of that creation all right so now we go to Second Peter 1 to read from verse 1-8 Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this now having that's that's the new birth we're going getting to those parts right and then now he's going to tell us how the growth development happens and besid this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're trying to get to a place of understanding and seeing the hour and the time that we're living and we look around and see how everything is Fally coming to a close as far as uh the Natural Things of life is is working out and you know everything's falling apart but we're not supposed to be concerned with that we're supposed to be concerned about our spiritual uh makeup of our being instead of the world that's that's all let going in anyway but you know to our makeup and our point of where we are because that's what we're trying to do and as we'll get to it on into the message see Peter is writing to people that had the same Holy Ghost experience our new birth that he had amen all right and then writing to them now then he's to you know he's writing to those people but lit listen now don't you ever think about the Bible as being something personal amen right amen all right see Peter's now listen Peter is not just writing to them back there right when we read this and read it with right understanding you realize he's talking to you and I right he's not you know we we say well he was back there talking to them and he was doing it no the Bible is supposed to be to you and I what they see and what others have seen before us has got to be the same way that's righten you've got to have your own experience in Jesus Christ and it's not that like we Baptist used to believe and say well we got the Holy Ghost and of course he doesn't like to use the word ghost a lot but they'd say we got the Holy Spirit you'd say well how do you know you got well it come on to day of Pentecost if you wouldn't ever there you wouldn't hear that but brother uh Lis is shaking his head a little bit because that's the way we were speaking we were saying well hey we got it because it come back to our well what does that matter no right you know that would be like saying uh well I've got corn in my garden why because there was corn me uh you know 4,000 6,000 years ago there was corn and I've got it no it ain't until I plan it I've had trouble doing that but you know but trying to get to a point of seeing that the Bible is speaking to you and I is it is not just talking to these people here Peter was telling these people here how to attain unto the place where he was but that's supposed to be transmitted down to you and I to where that it's speaking personally to you that's have you ever noticed in Malachi we know we we quote that a lot Malachi 4 says behold I send you Elijah the prophet that's right all right see then you make it personal you remember brother Brown's wife she was reading that and she wasn't she was wondering what did the mared brother brandom or not and she read that and it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet well we ought to make all of those things personal to us amen right all the scriptures should be speaking to you and I as Wade was saying one time we talk about Abraham and his faith but that was back there that was another man that was another situation that was another another time see you and I must have the experience of Jesus Christ personally to us and then the Bible is written to you and I all right now we tried too much you know we've tried two or three services talking about that Peter is saying that he's speaking to them of like Precious Faith that's right now the Bible listen to me the Bible is not written to the World am you say well no just listen the Bible is only written to those that are in Christ Jesus because the the Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the new birth right Born Again experience baptism of the Holy Ghost the words you use all right so then in in that we ought to consider and think about it that it's a wonderful thing that we can be able to read it because it's written personally to you and I well that's for somebody else to do that's for the no no how would you put Hebrews 13:8 there that's right Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same what yesterday today and forever all right whatever he has been he has to still be and what he is now he has to always be right to make it correct all right so then we'd have it in the line see not not saying that it's well it's so much this is for them and this is for that and this is for this no he's the same yesterday today and forever the people's the one that changes right and we change because of what we're taught right the churches we were in the things uh you know it's that's our problem is what we've been taught right now not throwing off on anybody that taught it cuz thank God for people that did teach us amen right thank God for somebody that the Bible would say even if Jesus is preached Why by contention which means argument you know no no no we're not supposed to argue but the Bible said if it's preached even by arguing somebody sitting around could hear it amen and receive it where the two that would be arguing might be be both of them lost all right but see it's it's to you and I it's not written and that's what I'm trying to deal with now to try to talk about that if there has ever been now let's take Hebrews 13:8 in the right way the same yesterday today and forever if there's anybody that was ever saved born again whatever you want to use him to terminologies and if anybody else ever reaches that place then God is obligated to give them the new birth right amen okay so then we go to the scripture where he said and the promis is unto you your children to them that are far off Gentiles coming on down towards us right and then to the entire world all right see if ever anybody ever received that's where our points we try to we try to uh uh what would you call it we try to theor theorize it or figure out some Theory you know and and try to make it look good about our thoughts but you know why make it that way why not this be what the Bible says am and if anybody ever received the baptism of the Holy Spirit anywhere then if it's not offered forever age thereafter then he's not Hebrews 13:8 that's right now we know that it came onto death Pentecost right we read about it coming on the day of Pentecost but what good is that as I said a moment ago what good is that until it happens to you and me right see then why would we not hold to the point that it's the same yes but now brother Dale you you you you're you're you know you got to put this here you got to put this here with that why if there was ever any person ever received the baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's right and any person ever re reach that position again God would be obligated right if anybody was ever healed true if you believe the same way that person did that was healed God's obligated to heal you not obligated because of obligated to be you he's obligated because he said he would it's not obligated to me and you as people God owes us nothing we owe him everything but yet he said he would do it right see then the Bible then is not written to sinners now a sinner can pick it up and read it you don't misunderstand a sinner can pick up the Bible and read it right and he can come to the point of getting saved right but you're not putting the Bible in the correct order because it's not written to him it's written to the person that becomes born again like to me if I was overseas and I'd write my wife a letter and I'd say tell the church I said hello and so and so and so and so y'all do this out of the other that that's part of the letter but who's the letter [Music] to I'm not writing to the church I'm writing to her to tell her what to tell the church see something personal all right see then we spent a lot of time going through uh justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and coming down to each stage and and transpiring and then we come to here where Peter and Peter is writing this letter and it's speaking to you and I so think about it Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them to you that have obtained like Precious Faith what with us right how through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ who's he writing to he's not writing to the world y That's right he's writing to those that are in Christ Jesus right amen we went over that and over that last week and and and all and if you ever need any more I've got plenty of them you ought to see what's stacked on my desk at home see we went we read some of these and I didn't give these to them but brother brandham said on the message earnestly contending for the faith he said it's he's addressing this to the church not to the outside world right it's not two the Bible he's talking about Jude and he's talking about Ephesians two scriptures all right he goes on over the believer's position in Christ to the faithful in Christ Jesus now this letter is addressed to those not to the world outside world not to see now watch not a sermon CU now listen I readon I brought this one because you see a sermon is a sermon to everybody right see I'm preaching a sermon that means the Lost can hear hear it and the saved can hear it and through the sermon The Sinner can come to the position of getting to Salvation right that's right see but it's not to him amen but it's a sermon part now watch to the faithful in Christ Jesus now this letter is addressed to those that's not to the outside the world not it's not a sermon Paul wasn't preaching here to the unsaved saved this is written to the Ephesians watch it he was preaching to the saved the called out the separated and set aside and faithful in the call see he's not the Bible is not written the position of a believer in Christ that was believer's position in Christ says this epistle the letter to the Ephesians was written to Believers not to the outside world this is Believers yes see it's not far the outside world I gave you a bunch but I've got a bunch more anybody wants them you're welcome to read where your Prophet said there but listen let me state it this way why can't we believe truth no matter who says it I don't mind quoting uh Billy Graham I don't mind quoting the Pope yeah I have no problem if he's telling the truth right I have no problem amening what he's saying if it's the truth why because it's the word of God well as I say in the start why couldn't we believe it then that if anybody ever receive the Holy Spirit anywhere than any other person down through there and that's what the scripture said and many as the Lord Our God shall call and brought it brought around say he said as long as he's calling the apostolic blessing is in succession or is available to you and I as long as he's calling amen but see we want to make it to where we we we want to do and I'll read the quote in a minute where brother Brown says we get this enough Holy Ghost till we quit lying and cheating we said God wants us to grow but you see that's the part of it we say well it's not here well why cuz I don't believe it now who gave you the right to say you don't believe it right that's right well I got a right to say I don't believe it okay go ahead and say you don't believe cuz that's where it's going to kill you okay do you mean it's not right just because you don't believe it yeah I remember one one time brother Brandon was going over to was talking about going to Africa and this man wrote him a letter and the way he wrote the letter he said we we don't want you over here because of you believe in this this this or this or this they come and find out that we was the one man you know it was him one man there was no we to it but see it's easy to say we we don't believe it this way one brother he used to say uh we don't believe it we We believe We believe I wanted to say well why do you believe I don't want to know what we believe in Lula Georgia as a group amen come on I want to know what we believe as individuals that make up a group then is not we it's those that are in Christ Jesus that's right but you see that's the doctrine that I told you that that in the statute of perfect man we just read in Peter some believes you get everything when you born again you got every bit of these things he's writing the other group believes you don't get nothing hardly you know just just enough to be a a better person and then when you'd say well well brother Brandon said it's the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost you know I don't believe that well who give you the right to say you don't believe it are you the prophet are we supposed to follow you yeah there's the we there's the point that we get right but see why wouldn't we believe you know you know you could walk right across over here to these church and they're Baptist basic and you could say Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and if anybody ever received the new birth then it would have to be for every person in every age and every time that would ever believe it the correct way you know why they say amen that's right you know why cuz they've never been taught the things of the people of the message has been taught amen that's right some of you have said and heard yes that the Holy Ghost is not here like it was in the book of Acts well I'm not against that part I'm glad the Lord showed that to to a sister she come to me other day she said brother Dale said the Lord spoke to me told me said you're not just trying to tell us we're lost you're trying to tell us you know we're lost and we need to be saved that's fine cuz that's in it but you're telling us that we're saved cuz see I can't talk to you until you get born again as the same Holy Spirit that's right right that's right see I the words I come across will be a sermon to you right that's what Paul that's right a sermon a sermon can bring a sinner to Christ right but then when a sinner comes to Christ he's just a baby he needs something to help him grow so that's what Peter was saying I've received this faith I have this precious Faith yes and I'm speaking speaking to those that have the same precious faith that I have amen right see then it's not written that way to the world Amen it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus okay see then that that to me you've got to put it that away CU how else could you put it you say well I just don't believe it cuz I don't see it open your eyes open your eyes and like I said the other day do you realize that this message has went around the world for the people of the land where has that ever been in time yeah Paul they had had the Known World note of Paul yeah that's the only time you have any thoughts whatsoever and it certainly didn't cover the world his message has gone around the world that in itself is a miracle Amen to realize that people that never had an opportunity to hear about Jesus Christ can hear a prophet speaking about Jesus Christ not just somebody talking about it or some point that's right what a wonderful thing amen but we think well well we just don't see it don't see what like I told you and I know see you you people get upset with me when I make statements but I've ask you to be sensible go to the book of Acts and write down how many miracles happened in the book of Acts read the book of Acts and write down how many miracles took place how many healings how many of the Dead raised how many of this and you know what brother random says he said there was more in one service than his ministry in the entire book of Acts I named off the other day a lot of things that had happened right here per number would be more than the Miracles in the book of Acts but yet you don't believe it because see now there's the point I'm not trying to tell you you're lost you must find out from God whether you're lost or not I'm trying to talk to you about salvation and what it is to be saved amen I'm not against anything like that listen I I'm not trying to preach to condemn people that don't believe the way that I believe okay I've never done that I've tried to tell the truth amen I've tried to preach the truth that's my goal is to preach the truth amen all right not to try to tell somebody else they're wrong but to try to preach the truth to where that you and I can have an opportunity I want my family I want this church to have an opportunity to hear the truth well who do you think you are I'm me who do you think you are solve that problem right right what's the point of bringing up that thought we I I'm a pastor of a church trying to to direct a group of people into the word of God to see where Christ is at sir into our hearts and our lives not what's out there youve never heard me get up here and preach long sermons about the woman getting in the White House and Russia coming after oil and all these things and just Bo more people just sit there and just shout and holler and scream when they hear those things and you start talking about salvation you start getting down where people live at I'm just trying to get you to think think for yourself what is that old saying I don't like his modern terminologies what is that think out of the box well that don't fit me I'm not in the box that's right amen right it's supposed to mean think for yourself right because the box is what everybody else think and you think out of the box that's just a simple terminology I know what these things are about but that don't fit to me why I want to talk to you about thinking out of the box outside the box or something I want to touch that Soul that's within that to where that you can make a decision yourself go that's salvation that's salvation for you to make your your own decision all right and we spent a lot of time talking about the new birth and how that it would would be that you know that we need these things that's right right but now we've come to the place of reaching a position to where that we're talking about what these disciples were talking about okay but see there's where we go see we go well I don't see like it is in the book of Acts why not wow now I'm asking you a simple question you be simple yourself if Jesus Christ is not here today just like he was in the book of Acts then Hebrews 13:8 is wrong the problem is you and I the problem is not God it's never been the holy ghost that was taken away show me that in the prophet's message or the Bible right it was never the holy spirit that was taken away it was the word that began to be ate down because of our interpretations and ideas and things and God can only work according to the amount of word that's is there amen right right but are you going to tell me that Luther and them didn't have the new birth exactly like the day of Pentecost right then where's Hebrews 13:8 if you're going to say that we don't have it today y you know what a brother said to me one time he asked me a question about it he was sincere I tried to be sincere he was saying that nobody had the Holy Ghost like it was in the book of Acts I said well brother brand was the one that said it now I'm not telling you that I'm and I'm telling you what brother brandham said he said he met people with the Holy Spirit the same as the day of Pentecost 50 years before yes he said what do you think's wrong I said listen I'm going to answer your question this way I think a lot of people don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right but I'm not saying no way would I say that nobody didn't have it right I'm just saying a lot of people ain't got it and think they got it that's right because what wrong I thought the Holy Spirit was to lead us to the word amen well let's see you signs and wonders let's see where has it ever been signs and wonders your Prophet said it had to be the word first right what does the Bible say these signs shall run before the Believers no that ain't exactly what the Bible said these signs shall follow thee them that believe so you're trying to get signs some kind of a doing brother Brown would speak of signs and wonders and speak of the Holy Ghost being here that's what we want to get to in the message but what I'm trying to do is to is to make sure you understand the Bible is [Music] written to them that have obtained like Precious Faith let's solve that right whether we want to talk about gifts and signs and wonders and what this is the Bible says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now are you going to say the Bible's wrong no you're going to say I don't understand it that way well then what do you mean if you don't understand it that way what do you mean come on it's time to be blunt and plain what do you mean if you believe he's not the same then you got to have some reason for not believing him I thought we believed that the cankerworm pmer worm Locust and the caterpillar ate the word down but I thought we were supposed to believe that justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet coming on the scene was to bring that back exactly like the scripture said it was amen right y y and you can see that Christ is here but see he's addressing this not to the world but to those that have escaped the corruption we read he's addressing this to the church all right he's addressing it to those that are in Christ Jesus amen okay y now then by addressing it to the same people that had the same experience he had Faith the Born Again experience Faith right here at the bottom of the pyramid Faith am all right the new birth whatever you want to call it Born Again experience New Birth baptism of the Holy Ghost to me it's all one and the same one is not a little bit and other there's a whole lot more and this a more no it's the same that's right but see think about it then Peter what are you doing who are you writing to to those that are in Christ Jesus Lula Georgia he's writing to you and I sitting here today right we claim to have the new birth right amen we claim cl to have that baptism of the holy spirit that new birth the Born Again experience my wife said the other day said why do you keep saying all them three together I want you to realize I believe all three of them the same thing it is the one and the same thing you want the ones that I got lay on my desk at the house where brother Randon says or maybe they're in the office where brother BR says there's not but one Holy Spirit there is not two holy spirits that is right right there's not but one New Birth there's many feelings but one birth they had one birth in the book of Acts but then they had many feelings every time they would meet the Holy Spirit would come down and would be great things right so you say but I'd like to see that again well what you're never going to see it do you believe it that's right that's right sin's not believing right the Bible doesn't say that the Bible says believe to see right right I believe to see okay amen cuz if you're waiting on something you can see but see that's where people don't want you to do that they don't want you they think you're trying to make something out of yourself to tell about experiences maybe we'll do it one day I'm looking at people that have had experiences of things that take place while we were rejoicing the other day sister had trouble with her hand her arm she couldn't raise it up couldn't do with it she just raised it up right well see we don't well that could be anything you know that could be mentally well praise God it happened whether it be mental spiritual or whatever it happened let's see you do it oh no see we don't believe it because it don't happen to us right but why not why can't we believe it because the word says it but Peter Peter who are you writing to I'm writing to them that have had the same New Birth that I've had not the growth development of the stature of a perfect man no they were up into here because that was coming into he had taught them for three and a half years but the 3,000 outside only heard one sermon that's why it was called babes in Christ Earnest of our inheritance but you know what they receive the same holy Spirit come on get Peter on over there to K's house come on K's house it only heard one or two little sermons or something or what had happened and sent for Peter to come and Peter comes over and what he said who can forbid these to be baptized see and they receive the Holy Spirit as we did at the beginning right right you see Church where we're at don't you yes so then Peter what are you going to do I want to tell you how to come to the place that I have obtained now this light precious faith that I have he'd come down through verse 1 2 3 4 5 right along in there everywhere it's come to the point and he's talking about they that had obtained to like Precious faith all right then he says add to your faith virtue no add to your faith virtue okay now he's going to tell you how to come on up through the the pyramid as to where he was at but he's having to relate it back to where that everybody would start it the same so it's your faith right now Faith is not a virtue that's right that's right faith is a birth amen like I told you babies are not born with virtues they must develop virtues as they live but they're birthed see then we must be borned again and how are we born again justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen that's right bringing you to the New Birth amen and Peter said all right now you got the new birth but said now what I want you to do is listen he said add to your new birth he said well how do you know that's a new birth we're going to let brother randam read it okay you're supposed to done listen to the message it over and over the statue of perfect man Blasphemous names know yes see then it shouldn't be any strange thing to read from it unless you do like you do with me maybe you sleep through half of it and don't hear I told you about the brother the other day he said what I heard of the message I believe well okay good point but listen we've done read these and come down with it but I want to get the main point or thought into your mind today that it's always been the same Holy Spirit in every age amen the Holy Ghost has been the same in every age mankind is what is different you can only manifest what you have has been revealed to you right that's right see then Peter says what he says You must he said you first he said add to your faith now let's take brother brandom and let him read it to where you can follow that point and you'll see what he's talking about go ahead now to paragraph 141 number one on your notes listen to him so he's reading Peter coming down and bringing it bringing it uh let's see 141 you got to you got to one you got to 33 go up to 141 uh you got to 18 go to one that's 1 a was the one we was using there a moment ago same thing you can we can read it but going up to paragraph which would be number one instead of one a I mess them up on that cuz I put one a and then one b and but go ahead is paragraph 141 look now here is what to do what's the first thing now brother around was explaining Peter right have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation now what's the foundation what's the foundation to the pyramid Faith that's right everything up through here is going to be a manifestation of a greater Faith amen and it will be Faith but it's just difference as it's working through what you're doing with it we're not into that yet we're just getting into these parts look he said have faith and be born born again and there's your faith that Peter says add to your faith virtues see all right so to get this Faith what do we do says watch then after you lay the foundationally secondly you add to your foundation he add to your faith you got to get the foundation first first pour your foundation Faith then your to then to your faith at virtue amen now listen it's called your faith yes I know I've been through this I'll keep going over and over because it's clicking to some and some are realizing what's taking place so if I have to repeat it I don't worry about it I didn't realize I remembered it after it was said brother Donnie said that he remembered me saying in the seals years ago that said when I get through and this come out to this place said I'll start back and I'll preach justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost CU see there's nothing new in the Bible it's all that it's all the new birth the seals of plagues the vows of Thunders all is to bring the revelation of Jesus Christ not the revelation of the Antichrist it's revelation of Jesus Christ to you all right look see then you add Faith go go ahead with number the next one number two this is paragraph 102 notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again in without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is a foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to believe God okay now listen it's your faith what is the new birth what is the new birth is it not the birth of the word right you received the word and the Word was quickened to you by the Holy Spirit right all that we talk down through there justification same all right what is it what is the new birth it's the Born Again experience is Christ coming to live in you but he give it to you and it's called yours why would Peter say that add to your faith he didn't say add Faith right we're going to get to that when we get down to where that we're going to have to talk about the how many ads cuz brother Brown said there's only seven ads now you look up and down through there you got a lot of things but he says there seven ads all right but just stay here with me do we get to that point see because what's he doing faith is the foundation of all things so he gives you listen he gives you the new birth he births the word in you that makes you and him one right in the new birth but it's your new birth you are the one that's born again right so it's your faith amen that's right this is my eye the prophet said God gave it to me he gave the new birth on the day of Pentecost that's right right see then faith is not a virtue it's a birth that's right you got to have something to start with a baby is not born with all of as I said it's not born with these virtues it can't talk it can't do anything can't drive a car it can't do anything it's just a birth y right the only thing it can do is cry right well you know what that's true with you and I cuz the only thing we can do is cry out to God but he gave us the new birth that's right and it's the the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession that's right all right it's the foundation you got to have a foundation to put something on the church is built upon a revelation of Jesus Christ right Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it am so there's your new birth Faith so the prophet then what's he's describing how to get born again right have faith and be born again you cannot be you know you cannot be saved without having the new birth that's the Salvation amen right right see then you talk about adding that's right get to birth that's right and you'll see why brother randam spent so much on it I gave it over and over but was you listening yes he said I call my an alter call he said I want him to come up and be born again receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said just like it happened on the day of Pentecost but he said the people come up thinking well these are already saved they already this that and they want to get them to speak in [Music] tongues right where they believe that they got the baptism he said no he said it's one and the same he said I give the altar call for you to come forth and be saved amen you say yeah but you spend all of this time explain right I explain what he said cuz he knew you didn't come to the Altar and get it all at one time he said that how many times did I quote that he said very few people will believe all the way to receive it the baptism of the holy spirit so he knew then and he would say okay you have repented of your sins that's justification now go on to sanctification and then go on to get Somebody Pray for you about the baptism you know why because he knew we didn't understand right cuz the best we' have done was trying to get somebody speak in tongues or tat already saved because they cried or believed or shouted see brother Brandon was having to face an age in a time when it was pitiful when he walked out there that's why it said that this Malachi 4 what he's going to restore the faith of the fathers the people had no faith of the fathers it didn't mean they didn't have a new birth but they didn't have any growth development they just shouted and cried and done everything and he tried his best to get people to believe it that's but they wouldn't believe it you know why they wouldn't believe it because the way they've been taught you know why people today can't believe because the way they've been taught well brother so and so says it's this way Hallelujah who's he but brother Dale or anybody else it don't make no difference to me y but you see I'm not talking my Ministry has never been talking to or trying to get people now listen please I try my best to get everybody in the world saved that I can right I preach for that but I know that the ministry I have doesn't deal with that type I'm not the one to get people to the altar to crying and praying out to God for salvation I'm the one that's trying to get those that have that to listen and grow development that's always been there well I can't help it but I do I believe still brother brandham like I said brother randam preached souls and pre prison and the altar filled with people to be saved I still believe the Holy Ghost can bring people in no matter which one of the Ministries he's using he can bring us in on it all right but see you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith right so there's your foundation Faith listen as we're going through go to number well the scripture go to the scripture and let's read it go to number three acts 238 listen what happened then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost listen amen for the promise is only just to a few people maybe one or two here somebody here might get that no no no it says is unto you y children amen and your children amen and to all that are far off Gentiles even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Jews Gentiles everything amen now that's the Bible That's Right amen then why would we want to think about the holy spirit being different in ages and things the new birth is a new birth but you see then like I said I'm not the ministry to to preach because if I was I would just try to make you feel good and get you to do it but my Ministry is to settle down and say all right hold on just a minute let's think this thing over am I all the way up to the pop of this pyramid or where am I at you had never thought about it you had never asked God where am I at you remember a sister I like her name was Shepherd Blasphemous names did she even had a dream about it and wondered where she was at the prophet took her dream and showed right where she was at he said God accepted her foundation than her faith that's in the dream it's in Blasphemous names if you listen to it you're supposed to heard it but look number four this is suning church age listen our church age book look what he says and in every age in every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believers I say in every age the evidence was the same those who heard the word took it and believed it right amen same holy ghost in every age that's right well I just don't believe we got it like they did in the book of Acts what do you mean why not just say you got it listen why don't you at least say I got it but it might not be like it is in the book of Acts no you're not saying that away you're saying I don't have it and you don't have it come on folks it's time to quit playing look at the next one which he's taken from Blasphemous names where you talking about the sister's dream but the five streams you see coming down through their tempers this together it has been the holy spirit that made the Ephesian church it was the Holy Spirit that birthed the saman church the holy spirit that gave the pergamus that gave the pergamus church the ti tyan Church in the Dark Ages come on it's the Holy Spirit that's built that bride the elect that that's pulled out of all the organizational organization system down Through the Ages like that am there's an elected a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy Spirit has called out of out the elect and it's been the Holy Spirit watch him it's been the holy spirit in this age that age that age that that that that that on up to the top the holy spirit all right that should be enough right and now as in individuals these virtues and things are for you know knowledge and temp are added to your faith then when the Capstone comes which it hasn't come yet that's what your Prophet said the Holy Spirit cements it together there is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so short today why why is it so short because you got people with a new birth you realize on the zeusa street they received the baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost just like the book of Acts the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the zeusa street was the same holy spirit amen that fell back in the Bible time amen the Bible's wrong or your prophet's wrong if you don't believe it that way that's right I'm not trying to argue as what I'm saying I'm not trying to preach something to try to prove somebody wrong I'm trying to preach it to where you and I can have an opportunity to receive Christ and talk about it being the same let's take it to let's just talk about this him being the this holy spirit being the same at Pentecost go ahead let's start number six believest thou this Peter said on the day of Pentecost it's for you and for your children and for them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and every person that enters into the baptism of the spirit can have the same kind of holy ghost that they got on the day of Pentecost amen hallelujah he said I believe it's true not something that looked like it but the real thing same kind of holy ghost that fell back dire Falls now the same kind the real Holy Ghost brings forth the same kind of an Evidence and that they had back there comes with the same Holy Ghost you say but I just don't see that he said just the same holy spirit that fell back there on the day of Pentecost now he didn't have any trouble saying it why can't we that's right go to the number seven look what he says where I think Pentecost failed 55 the same Holy Spirit was upon Christ was his Manel that God gave him the anointing of the Holy Spirit now that was his Manel right the anointing of the Holy Spirit and they went up at Pentecost and waited in the upper room that when Jesus that when which was the antip of Elijah was taken up from death and resurrected he sent back the Manel the same holy spirit that was upon Him fell on the church right and he said the things that I do shall you do and greater thing a double portion of the same holy ghost that was upon Christ is upon the church and Elisha took that mantel and walked down to the river and struck him CU that's Elisha and Elijah right come on all right go to the next one which is oness pre 62 what is it you got to get with the word get yourself killed out now listen I love this one because it's true about me you and all of us but it's still the truth I'm persuaded that many of us friends have receive the Holy Ghost and but watch's our trouble but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we want to don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill you your thinking he wants to fill your mind every bit of you he goes on to say completely totally dead see that's what's wrong with the church yeah what's wrong with the church they got to birth sir but ROM never denied Pentecostal people with a new birth that's right he said they had it just like the book of Acts that's right y but he says you need a growth development amen right adoptions and the things that goes with it amen we'll get to those things as we go along but the main thing is get to the birth amen are you truly Born Again amen just remember now we'll put this and settle it the holy spirit will act the same on every person that it's ever in right and you're going to act like on one person but not act like it on the other person now forget that so then what's been our wrong what was my point back there and when we talking about justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost when I said here's a prophet says women overseas when they see Jesus Christ they fold their arms and walk out women here just get get more naked and naker amen but got they say they got the same Holy Ghost now there's something wrong right right the Holy Ghost only acts one way it's the same in every age and acts the same our trouble is what he said we get just enough Holy Ghost to quit lying and cheating okay well that's just no that's a birth the birth makes you a baby right the birth don't make you a stature of a perfect man that's what I'm trying to get at Peter's trying to tell you how to grow up trying to tell Lula tell you how to grow up me how to grow up right going to the next one all right that's the rejected King let's see wait a minute we're on number nine all right yeah the same Holy Spirit roll this up same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost I want you which we all know that that that that was the birth of the new church and watch him if that same holy Holy Spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you got a different Holy Spirit now how many point how many do you need there's only one holy spirit so now what's he saying he's not saying you got a holy spirit that made you do this but we got a holy spirit that's genuine no he's saying you got something wrong right is that what he's saying if that holy spirit that don't don't bring the same experience then you got a different Holy Spirit than what that was exactly right if it don't make you live a sacrificial life and a life full of joy and pleasure and the baptism of the spirit leading you into signs and wonders and miracles and things there's something happened Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe what's wrong with the church they're following their own ideas and opinions right instead of even believing what God Said right even to think about it go ahead to the next one we won't get all these R but at least you'll get enough this is taking off Redemption and completeness he says the same Holy Spirit fell then Falls now right and we go Plum on from that time to the end of time it'll go right on through it's our bread they were fed with the natural bread we are fed with the spiritual so then what fell back there has to keep going on them down okay go to the next one read fast if we can go to 12 11 excuse me expect see well now the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost that's healed the sick back there it's been here in the church all the time yes okay but the thing of it is you don't know how to make it work for you amen now there's our problem we don't know how to make it work so we say it's not there Y and then we now watch it come on are we right then somebody does speak of God working in their lives anointed ones can do that too praise the Lord but what's the matter with you you mean anointed ones can do it and you claim the Holy Ghost and can't oh no brother Dale okay well all right come on time to put it on the line that's right right that's right then you start telling about things that happened in your life and people just draw up well it never happened to me I wish you would would I wish every one of you would write down at least one thing that's happened in your life one great experience has happened in your life and I'll come right here and I'll read every one of them for the glory of God because Church we're not out there playing with this silly stuff you don't have nothing I don't have nothing we just sit around waiting on the bus for up we've seen God raise the dead we've seen him heal all kind of sicknesses we've seen all kind of Miracles take place that's right that are not questioned right right but yet see I can tell say well the Lord changed my blood type from a negative to a I mean a positive to a negative well that was just a half well do you see why can't we believe what God has done with us Ryan would be glad to get up here and talk about his daughter wouldn't you Gabby would be glad to make a statement or two about their little daughter that is not supposed to be here today I still think he's Hebrews 13:8 church I think what's wrong with us is we're not [Applause] believing watch him but the thing of it is you don't know how to make it work for you listen now there's the thing that makes it work is Faith to believe and when you believe and take him at his word that's a Lifeline it cannot fail go ahead to the next one amen Peter said on the day this is the inter Veil Peter said on the day of Pentecost Acts 2 he said for the promises unto you and to your children to them that are far off and as many as the Lord Our God shall call the same holy spirit that fell was forever generation even to the Gentiles I I love that those that were always considered far off even as the many and then listen roll this up now as long as God's still calling God's still giving the Holy Spirit But but so and so said it was this way okay and then may I ask the question are we going to believe so and so are we going to believe the Bible which one are we going to believe all right look at the next one I love this part listen this is the hidden life he's talking about get kind of make up you know emotion or mental makeup uh we don't have to take something the devil would hand down listen but every believer that comes from the altar to the consecrated life to the baptism of the Holy Ghost can get not only a mouthful listen but a soul full of the original baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost okay that enough how about it jump over jump over to number 15 brothers and we'll call we'll quit this is from questions and answers in 1954 I roll it up just down at the bottom of the quote prob he's talking about ungodly spirits and living in human beings cuz that's what's happened down through time you order to see it today now someday these men will die now watch him he's talking about the ungodly spirit and if there's another generation they'll come right down on them right demons coming down generation to generation watch it God takes his man but ever his spirit this is the same holy spirit that they received on Pentecost let me see if I can grab a couple [Music] uh I want to get to one more cuz I want to bring it um jump on over to number 22 the Oneness of unity look what he says he's on the service he's praying for people and things are taking place and watch he said if you couldn't walk stand to your feet if you're blind take off your Shades from your eyes you can see watch it roll it on up a little where everybody can see it the Holy Spirit p pass through this place just now in a confirmation of the word hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord watch him a wind like went over the building how many could feel that when it went through here see raise your hand be honest with yourself that wind that passed through the building that's the Holy Spirit now watch him say it and it shall be done like a a great moving wind loving wind went swoosh right down across through here and I heard it as it crossed over the audience you heard it and felt it too it's his presence all now that feel different all that feel that you're healed and everything you know it's in Christ Jesus what was that just like the Holy Spirit Come on the day of Pentecost come right down the wind just swept over here how many is a Witnesses raise your hand everyone honest with you no see it's the same Holy Spirit the same Holy Spirit comes by the same word blessed be the name of the Lord that's one and drop down drop to number 23 because we'll get these two because it's two different accounts of the Holy Spirit taken doing that cuz this one's taking off the handwriting on the wall and he says the other night now he's referring back now watch him he's got to get it together now he's referring back to the cuz that was on uh 58130 and on 58128 was the Oneness message the other night if there would happen to be one be be one stranger we had the most thrilling thing that I have heard in many years of the personal coming down of the Holy Spirit just like it did in the Bible right here the noise like a Thunder roaring coming out of the heavens and the spirit of the Lord coming through the building like an unseen wind that was shaking and taken it the people as he went through many of them in here are still Witnesses how many is here to Witnesses just exactly the way it did on the day of Pentecost okay listen list okay yeah and just praying while in prayer no emotions and watch and just praying while in prayer no emotions no running like they did at the day penos see not they wasn't running around they sitting there but the same Holy Spirit come in as a rushing Mighty Wind with a roar that I thought first when it was coming that it was an airplane watch him now that had swept down into the building and Doctor Lee Vale here thought it was a sounded like the reversing of the Wind in a pipe uh organ now watch him and he looked around to the organ and it's an electric organ he thought it was the sound in the you know thing then he heard it was coming from above and went right down come down here and around to the pull pit no what it was a glorious experience okay now if I can find the other okay that's all right there was another experience he was talking about in a line and he says did you feel it said there is the same holy spirit so why wouldn't we want to believe that it's the same Holy Spirit had always been here why wouldn't we want to believe it's been in every age and been forever believer that would ever believe it because if we don't believe it we can't have the new birth if we don't have the new birth like on the day of Pentecost then we can't start up the stature of a perfect man there's the trouble people don't believe it come on you there's the trouble that's what I was reading the trouble is what the people don't believe the same holy spirit that was on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Spirit that's here right now to save you so thereby God can't bring it to pass and watch even those am I quoting him we get just enough Holy Ghost to stop this that even even those who have the same Holy Spirit doubt the presence of God being it real and and it being like it was in the book of Acts why why would we not believe it yeah but I just don't see the signs and wonders there will never be to the Gentile dispensation another Prophet The Prophet is com and gone he had the signs the resurrection and all of the things it's not promised for us to do those things but I do love what the prophet said after the door this Gentile church is go God will anoint a church and he will do in one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now that's all of questions and answers brother around and said there'll be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll come one day that it'll fill every fiber of our being and take us into Rapture amen right amen when are we going to believe God is here see if we don't believe he's here he can't work oh yeah but he no no come on don't let's don't get out of the Bible with our own theology Jesus could not heal in certain places he had to take the person outside or either turn out everybody to get them out of there why and the Bible said he couldn't do no great miracles in one city he said because of their unbelief that's right you believe it was almighty God don't you well then if he was almighty God why couldn't he work because that unbelief what do you think brother brand would be standing there trying to explain to the people about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and seeing that unbelief it was setting out in front of him as dark objects and things hooded things over people's eyes and face and he Begg God he said I laid before God now this is a quote he said I laid before God to get this gift to work he would lay before God and then beg God to come and work that gift in the church that they could see Christ right because of their unbelief they couldn't follow it so look at it now what's happening around the message people of what they're doing they're turning against him calling him a false prophet they calling him everything in the book I like what the brother said said well that's a false prophet praise the lord we found out one thing God has prophets false or true so if he's got a false he got to be true that's right so praise the Lord there's got to be a true one somewhere right so we believe God has sent us a prophet the Holy Ghost to direct us all the way through that's it developed into a man and the great signs and wonders but we're not left empty-handed and this is what I wrote on my desk and left you mean to tell me that we think that we're at the end of the world right we believe we're at the end of the world we're not making dates and times and Seasons right but we believe at the end of the world right we believe the end of all things has come upon us and you mean to tell me that God is not here the way he was there we'll go back through the message and show where it gets greater and greater and greater right what was back there brother Brandon my God I had them there had to bypass them he said the same holy ghost that fell back there he said fa here Falls here and see we think that that Holy Spirit is not here for that you mean to tell me God is ending this thing up and going to take somebody in a Rapture when there's not going to be a God moving Among Us it's like I told you though you know what the problem is people say I don't have it you don't have it but when I get it I'll tell you how to get it every Doctrine there is you want to stand up four hours and talk about them every doctrine that there is in this message has got a man standing in front of it to tell you that when I tell you when it's here oh but they don't say that come on be sensible and listen think about it let's stand what do we got number 257 see I believe the Holy Spirit has always been the same I believe the word was eat down and promised to be Resto but we got to confess he's here in it feel their heart with singing and them peace with the pro the you mean God was back there but he's not here that the spir would you mean you make God greater in one age than the other and you mean we're the end the whole thing and don't believe God is with us know well let just don't see him open your heart there is a r but you're not going to do that from you're not going to say God is the same why not there is a fountain when I declare Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and [Music] forever brother I just never seen him will you go down somebody that tell you they have to these Wat for there is a supp brother R said all God wanted to do would get one person you need that quote he said if he can get one person to believe him he'll make manifest his word well I'm doing everything I can to believe it and I've seen him manifest his from the dead raised to sick healed all kind of [Music] things see Church there's a late hour anybody have a need [Music] the see I believe Jesus Christ to be the son I she made the same he was he still is and he told of great s and he said if you will drink from this Fountain you'll never thirst again for there is a river that flows from deep within and there is a fountain that free the soul from sin oh God to this water there is the vast Supply there is a river that never shall run Dr
