and Mori this morning and uh always got to keep everybody in prayer for the sick bless your hearts it's uh it's been a while since I've had anything and I'm trying to I'm trying to uh trust in the Lord and not be uh brother Dale and I were talking the other day we we can be it's like juel and I brother juel were talking he said it says call for the Elders of the church so you call somebody and have them come pray for you don't come in here sick you know call for the Elders of the church the Lord knew was going to have telephones back then I guess say call for the Elders of to come and pray for you so good to be in the house of the Lord you got your Bibles obviously we're going to go to Second Peter 1 and today we're just going to be this is just going to be an introduction uh to the statute of a perfect man I believe it's a very important subject uh hugely important um it's it's a requirement for graduation so it's a required subject so if it's a required subject you know we always hated English and we always I did I didn't like English I I love math and and all that but you still had to get through English to get a degree so to get your degree to get out of here you're going to have to go through this or you don't you can choose one or the other your choice you can choose whether you want to do it or whether you don't want to do it all right but it's requirement for graduation all right so second Peter 1 U I know brother Dale's already said but remember brother Luis he is uh over there doing his work and uh he'll be back on the 20th so keep him in your prayers you'll be gone for a few weeks and remember also myself I'll be gone uh to the Philippines the 25th of February to March the 17th so that'll be a a 3- week uh ordeal so just keep us in your prayers also Fellowship meetings coming up this month be at brother Homer long Gore It's will be on the 17th of January if anybody wants to go let us know not this coming weekend but the next weekend all right uh and also I'd like for you to read while during the week read the statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names because brother brandham continues the next week right the same thought that he had on Statue of a perfect man and also if you get a chance read the evening service of statue of a perfect man which is the guide of my life or a guide cuz really and truly the guide has to guide you through this humanly we can't make it through it humanly we won't make it through it okay so but with with God's help we'll make it through it so um we started in February of 2013 downstairs in the Sunday school class so it took that long for us to just to get to the holy spirit so we're going to try to cram it in in in January we uh covet your prayers for that so let's bow our heads and and talk to the author before we before we get started dear Lord Jesus we pray today Lord that you would sanctify us for this journey you told ones Lord that were going into the promised land to separate yourself and pray and get ready to go over or father we pray that we've tried to do that and we pray that the congregation will also do it whether we be at Faith virtue knowledge Temperance wherever it may be it really doesn't matter we're all one in you but father we want more of you we want to we want the ability for you to live with freedom through our life and not be bound by the things of the world or or the things that Satan brings to us father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes and the things we do wrong bless the sick that are among us and the ones that are that are home Lord and and thank you for having the uh internet service there for them to watch but Lord we'd rather them be here father enjoying the word of the Lord but Lord as they are sick may you send your word today through the airwaves and heal the people because father you know no distance you're an eternal God that can go around the world in less than a split second Lord you're already there so we pray that you'll go to the ones that are sick Lord just raise them up for you father bless this day continue to be with us bless us through this service in Jesus name amen second Peter 1 verse one now this is Peter bringing something to us that was spoken in the first church age right now that ability to attain that has not been diminished over the ages but it has been lost in Creeds and man's ideas um because it was very much alive and I'm going to give you a few points to ponder this morning as far as an introduction because the from Faith to brotherly kindness there where the holy spirit is that's not something new that brother brandham brought to us that's right it was in the Bible amen it was taught in the first church age so it was in the first church age they had those virtues working in their life so it's not a new doctrine but it took a prophet to tie the loose ends up where that people had say oh you don't really need that or you don't really need this you don't really need that no brother randam comes back and he says okay this is what Peter said it's a requirement and this is what we have to do right all right it's a requirement like I said for graduation so let's just read it Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ now what I've got blue is something that that's what I want you to ponder on um during the series cuz we're going to read this every time the Lord willing I think to them that have obtained light precious Faith all right obtained they went and got it they don't they don't bring the eggs to your house anymore you got to go obtain them at the grocery store so you have to go obtain to them and I put myself in that category to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so it's not of our own righteousness Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us and here's our gifts given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness now I want you to see that I the Sunday school class downstairs I think it really hit one day when I read this early in the in the uh study it pertains to life and godliness so this is going to be everyday life amen and the godliness in that life all right it's easy to be Godly here it's not easy to be Godly Monday morning at 7:00 okay but if you'll do these things we'll see through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given so these gifts are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers now he's going to give you something of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now what is the divine nature of God Genesis 1:26 and 27 is the divine nature of God Jesus Christ was the divine nature of God the nature that Jesus had is exactly the nature that God had or he's a separate person all right so the same nature Jesus had is the same nature God has cuz it's the same being and besides this see there's where we'll talk about this in a minute but let me read it and let you sit down and besides this in other words besides verse 1-5 you got to do something else and besides this divine nature giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance into Temperance patience into patience godliness into godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity right for if there's that little word that's huge if these things be in you comma and abound right abound means overflow not just get a piece of all right abound means to overflow you go into a full Buffet your plates full all right they make you all right these things will make you that you will neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind okay and cannot see a far off and ha for for gotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence look at all these things abounding in diligence he's you got to strive listen folks these are overcoming they're are character developments that's not just something that's given to you because you're a message believer give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things let me read let's read that together for if ye do these things ye shall never fall you want to not ever fall do those things Lord bless the word and you be seated but I want to as an introduction we you know we all read these scriptures and I told them that in Sunday school class I didn't it was not a this was not a um a time for them to uh lay out or be asleep we need some amens from the ones that's already heard this amen there you go getting started out well but I want to bring this to you this morning just as an introduction and a brother told me one time at the last ministers meeting and it's really stuck with me he said and he's preaching on a statue of a perfect man there in South Carolina Brother David belon he said this statue of a perfect man is the centerpiece of this message now what's a centerpiece a centerpiece of a table is what attracts you to the table you've look you've went to Banquets or or weddings you have a centerpiece that centerpiece is your first attraction to get you to come and see what's on the table so that's what the stature of a perfect man is it's not something that you can get around it's a requirement all right amen and it's also a subject that's ill taught and it's not taught much around the message I have not heard one person preach on it except brother Dale and a few others to take a series on the Statue of a perfect man and preach on the virtues I wonder you can't preach on something you don't know right so I I wonder about some preachers that uh maybe don't know uh how to get up there because you know what Peter was not Peter was not talking uh in a second person uh Peter was not looking at a secondhand Revelation when he said add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge cuz he had those things because remember he was walking to the gate beautiful and he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have what virtue came out of that man and he didn't have to go get it from a bishop or he didn't have to go get it from anyone else he it was already in him all right so it's as we said before a few points it's the centerpiece of this message without the statute of a perfect man taught in the correct order you cannot come to adoption right one more time you cannot come to adoption routing around the stature of a perfect man exactly all right you must come through these virtues these virtues must be birthed into your life they must be a part of your life and and as we go through this we're going to bring some charts out but uh just for reference points though look at that statue of a perfect man now that's not like a gas tank you don't fill up with faith and then stop and then fill up with virtue and stop and then fill up with knowledge those are only reference points in a picture I wish you could take all that out take all the lines out and turn them up this way because you need Faith all the way up virt all the way up knowledge all the way up Temperance all the way up but there is a time in your life where God will show you where you're at right cuz he'll put somebody in front of you to see how your Temperance isly I told him downstairs Temperance and patience they go together but look what they're right at though they're right before godliness so if we break through with those virtues maybe we can start adding a little godliness but remember this requires study though right brother brandham studied on this subject for 30 years before he preached it right and he come to a position where he could bring it to the people and bringing it to the people it requires study because if you'll keep on going like I said the next Sunday he preached on it again he was preaching Blasphemous names but he brought right back in the Statue of a perfect man and then the week before he talked about it and then a couple of months later he continued to talk about adding to your faith and all those things I'll right up to the opening of the seals which we're going to look at that today and that's what I'm saying I'm going to put it's going to be an introduction we're not going to talk about virtues today we're just going to talk through the scriptures and through the prophet's message about where all these things come from out of the word of God so let's turn to Ephesians 4 and begin there because I believe that Paul picked up the same thought as Peter I believe I believe Paul was at the faith of the fathers Paul had these virtues working in his life so Paul having these virtues working in his life he could explain them but he may have not have explained them in a in the same way as Peter Peter was giv you a requirement add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge and and he come to a spot and he really didn't tell you how he just knew that he just saw that you had a to get the divine nature of God you had to get the new birth you had to get these things in your life but then Paul comes around being a prophet and he tells you how to get them okay Paul comes along a little bit later and explains how to get them and you're not going to get them any other way than this all right verse 11 and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers problem is like brother juel said they keep crossing their gift they need to keep their gift in order everybody needs to keep their gift in line because like I was telling him I said you you're an evangelist you you preach to people a teacher really doesn't preach to people he preaches to the older in the Lord and the pastors and the elders reason being is you can only get so much as a teacher you can only get so much in an hour or an hour and a half or whatever right but if you can get the preacher to see what you see right right then he's going to live with you for 365 days he's going to take the Revelation that he gets he's going to break it down to you we're just so fortunate that that that brother Dale doesn't have to go everywhere to get his Revelation and God brings Revelation to him through all of us through the five-fold ministry and um and we get to get it firsthand so but verse 12 says for the perfecting of the Saints so here's what Paul's telling us this is how you going to get the statue of a perfect man for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ right till what till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man now that's what we're preaching on the stature of a perfect man not a statue a statue is is immovable right a statue cannot move a statue cannot do you any good you just look at it and say that's pretty all right but a stature is growth or height development so we're growing up in God till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure see there's your measure measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children amen okay you can't be a child and be there where brotherly kindness is you can be a baby at Faith but you can't be a baby at brother L kindness right all right cuz you've grown up Paul said I the things I done as a child i' done as a child but I left them and I went on to other things that we henceforth be no more children see be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning crafts whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking with truth and love amen okay may grow up into him in all things so what's Peter Paul doing Paul's taking what Peter said and he's telling you how to get it and what's going to happen when you get it okay but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head there where it says love even Christ all right from whom the whole body fitly joined together and we're going to get into that not today but later on fitly joined together and compacted Glory it's not just that we're going to put the building together we're going to pack that thing in just like The Pyramid in Egypt where you can't put a razor blade through those stones to cut them it's going to be so compacted together by that which every joint Supply Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelist Ley Elders deacons that's why that you know that's why that that's what he's saying watch this according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so it's for the body it's for the edification of the body alone it's not for anything else it's for the body of Christ no one else this is not to the outside world this is kind of like marriage and divorce it's not for the outside world it's not something you can teach a novice how to receive these things right because number one I said many times the ill teaching in the message is a lot of people teach that you got to that you got to get all these virtues before you get born again because brother random talks about the holy spirit being where it is well how you going to get the divine nature of God as Peter was talking about how you going to get the divine nature of God exactly without having God in you first and then receive these virtues all right it's kind of like a an analogy I was thinking about the other day it's like a car you know it's like you buy a brand new car and you went from Donnie brought an a model to the house a to the house the other day very simple gear shift blinker it got a horn on it no blinker oh I'm sorry blinkers is this but now you take that that's still a car but now you take Dad's car that's got you know that that tells you when the when the tires low right now they're both cars one's just a little more advanced in the other one but you know what Donnie can get in the a model and he can get in the Tahoe and he can drive both of them but there's a lot more to that Tahoe than just driving it down the road right everybody get this say Amen if you don't say oh me some of you just sit there like you're not even here in this building bless your heart I feel for you but you got all these things like a computer you know we got a computer that you get a brand new computer and how many of you use everything in that computer Josh does but he's skilled in what he's doing if you're skilled in what you're doing you can use all the things same way with a new birth with a new birth you get all the bells and whistles and gadgets that you need you can still drive the car you can still come to church and be a good Christian and you're born again and you're going to heaven and you're in the bride but there's a lot more to that car right that you haven't started messing with right but with somebody that puts you in a class that'll teach you how to use those things why is the reason that you don't if you never fool with electricity in your life why why is it that you won't even open that see that fourth those four plugs over there I wouldn't open that why I'm scared of it I'm afraid I'll stick my finger or the screwdriver in the wrong place right but now what about a master electrician just like ty shoes he'll go over there open that up move the wires never get never get electrocuted never turn the thing off I'd have to make sure the main was off out here in the on the parking lot cuz I'm afraid of electricity I hate that jolt and Daddy can just stick his fingers in there and just you know it's Wonder his hair's not kinky many times he's been shocked but if you know what you're doing you understand what I'm saying if you've been taught well if God has taught us then these virtues are added as we study we must study to show our self approved we must study it's required study I'll read it in just a minute where brother BR said these things are a requirement but remember it all begins with a desire if your desire is just to get in that Tahoe and drive it like you do the a model and turn the you know just pull it in drive and turn turn signals and mash the gas you know what you're going to get where you're going may not be as comfortable but you're going to get where you're going but why why not now that God's give us this great word in the end time with no limitations and and and we don't study and we don't you know we do things that that are wrong and it's like you know many times you brother Dale said it one person one person with unconfessed sin in the congregation makes the whole congregation it's a canker right it's a soar you should never I mean like uh and and I apologize if I've done anything last year to any of you brothers and sisters I apologize to today sincerely apologize and and forgive me if I've hurt your feelings or and I know I have so I you can just start shaking your head if I open my mouth most of the time I do but I got to get on up there toward godliness and brotherly kindness maybe a little bit more have a little more patience with you but just forgive me and you ought to do that you ought to keep yourself clean if you play an instrument If You Preach behind here if you're a deacon you better keep yourself clean cuz you're the canker that's killing the church right that's right you're the caner that's killing the church if you're not prayed up ready for the service and you know how the devil is though he'll make sure you have problems before you get here oh yeah but remember one thing these virtues and this whole message is an overcoming you have to overcome and I know a lot of y'all at home are sick but you know what the Overcomers come to church the Overcomers come to church cuz you had to overcome getting your kids ready getting this ready getting dinner ready for today you had to overcome something and I know you have to stay home sometimes I know that but but my people some of you don't come back for second service I can't understand that you can cut wood all day you can watch football all day but you can't come to church two services for God not for me not for brother Dale but for God the Bible still says forsake not assembling yourself together you know what you're doing you're hurting your influence with the church and you're hurting yourself so just deal with it but this statute of a perfect man begins with a desire right even a desire and and and let let me say this delicately even though you may think you're up there where the love part is or the Holy Spirit part is or the brotherly kindness part is we still need to hear these things we still need that's what I said I I don't like those lines there I'd rather turn them up or either do away with them and just put all those virtues uh moving about in that stature because that's not a that's just a um uh a graph or a chart there should be a person standing there Jesus Christ and all those virtues working in and out of his life and then then if we're the body then where are we supposed to be we're supposed to be in that body part but let me read that one more time Ephesians 4:16 For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part you're all important everybody's important maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen the stronger supposed to help the weak we're all supposed to do that cuz I may be weak in something that you're strong in you may be strong in something I'm weak in or vice versa you know back and forth so we need to help each other but we still must keep oursel clean by the word of God and then let God guide us through these virtues because uh as I was saying last night I think to somebody God knows where you're going to get to but you don't right not yet it's a journey if we knew the end from the beginning we'd be we'd be Almighty and you know what it'd probably scare to death if we knew the very day something was going to happen so thank God we don't we live day to day we live hour by hour but we live with the intent of getting to church on Wednesday night getting to church on Sunday you know doing the things of God you it's important it's important listen if it's important for for somebody like sister Trudy to come to church Drive 4 hours you know how many people she's going to condemn on that day for not coming to church at least 5 minutes from here 15 minutes from here an hour from here because remember what you show out don't care what you got up here like brother J was saying I don't care what you got up here if you don't show it out here what good is it sermon coming from here is wonderful I've known people that could that's got Revelation like you wouldn't believe there's one brother that long time ago and he was caught in adultery with a young girl and all this things but that guy could preach the house down the message of the hour for years preached just preached wonderful messages whole time laying in the bed of adultery with a 14y old girl and a 30-year-old girl and finally got caught and was you know punished for that but still you got to remember one thing it's the life that's going to come down to for the the the life is the last thing it's going to come to that your life is going to speak louder words than anything that comes from your mouth amen well I got quiet but that's okay it's the truth anyhow amen it's the truth it's what it's the it's our cuz remember 90% of the time we live in the world we're not of the world if you're born again now if you're not born again you still are of the world and you do the things of the world and that's the reason you don't do the things that are right but if the spirit of God's in you why if the spirit of God's in me that says I have to be here not just because I hold an office I have to be at church to get this is my filling station this is where I get that fuel to go up that statue of a perfect man and you can't get it any other way I'm sorry but God knew that that's what we needed because he knows where every one of us is going to stop he's not going to uh you know you see the scripture there where he says don't cast your Pearls Before Swine God's not going to throw something out there knowing that you're not going to use it right he's going to know where you're going to be but I'm going to the very last quote that I read maybe this afternoon is going to lay it every bit back in our lap brother Brown makes one outstanding statement I I believe it's in uh maybe in Blasphemous names no it's in the Statue of perfect man it's going to lay it right back in our lap and it's up to us we're still a free moral agent after you're born again you are still a free moral agent you still have the right to accept or reject or to do what God asked you to do or not do what God asked you to do I I don't uh you know I I don't play words when it comes to that so let's let's go now to Zechariah Chapter 6 and verse 12 they'll have these up on here so we can we can get them pretty quick so I don't have to spend a lot of time looking and it's always on the internet the notes are Zechariah 6 and speak unto him saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch right and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall be build the temple of God now that's your basis cuz who was the branch Jesus Christ so there's the one that he grew up the Bible said Jesus grew in Grace and knowledge and favor with man now it wasn't that he had to receive the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost but he grew in his Humanity in Grace and knowledge all right and favor with man so he had a growth development he had a time where God gave him a place on a mountain to where he uh and we'll read it right here in just just a minute but remember one thing we we're laying an introduction so we're going to kind of come back off a little bit and look at that and see that now as a mountain because we're going to take this and by the help of God we're going to take this and show that that that has to be revealed in your new birth and through your life but that's also the pattern of the city we're going to live in sure amen the future home brother vom comes right back around and brings the pyramid right back in a pyramid shaped mountain now it's not going to look straight like that it's going to have valleys and all things in it but it's going to be so huge but it's going to be a pyramid mountain and who's going to be inside that pyramid City everybody that comes through faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness amen and the love of God is going to be right there on the top where you see in Revelations we'll read it at the very end where the what the throne sits at the top and it can you can see it all the way around now there's no way to see it all the way around unless that thing sitting right on top of that mountain cuz that's the headstone that's Jesus Christ amen so this this types all the way through the all the way through the the message of the hour and all the way through the Bible it types all the way from from Genesis to Revelation because remember Moses had to go up onto a mountain he met God in the plane sure but he had to go to the mountain to get his commission he had to go to that mountain to get the Ten Commandments Jesus had to go up on a mountain to receive his adoption brother brandham had to go to Sunset Mountain he had to get on a mountain in other words it was sure it was symbolic but God must like to meet somebody on the mountain right he must cuz it's where he meets him he meets he's met all the Great Men on on a mountain somewhere all right so let's turn turn to Zechariah 4 and let's see and and use this little um truth here that I believe it'll help you because sure we're going to work on faith virtu knowledge temp SP God brotherly kindness that but there's there's the framework we got to deal we got to work on the framework we got to get the foundation right then we got to work on the framework of you know you say well why do I have to have these things well number one they're requirement they're in the amen number two I just told you Paul told you how to get them all right so he had you have to listen to Apostles prophets Pastor teachers evangelist and study to make yourself approved all right so but watch what's going on here with Zachariah now this man at zerubabel was an actual person he rebuilt the city of Jerusalem after the after the Captivity he come out of jerus he come into Jerusalem rebuilt the city so let's watch in Ze arah who art thou oh great Mountain okay but now watch what's going to happen before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plane now what's a plane level down at the bottom got to start down at the bottom you can't start at the mountain he's building the great Mountain but he's putting you on a plane everybody's going to be right on that level you know if you're born again you're right there at Faith not up or down or whatever all right who art thou oh great Mountain before or zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain but watch what he's going to do and he shall bring forth The Headstone Now where's The Headstone The Headstone is not down here headstone up here he's going to bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so obviously it's going to be grace that we get this all right moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the the foundation of this house his hands also shall finish it so the one that started is the one that's going to finish it all right the author and finisher of our faith so you say well zerubabel would type brother Brandon well you got to go to God first it types Jesus Christ first amen all right cuz remember Jesus Christ built that mountain and then man tore it down then zerubabel came and rebuilt it okay the prophet of God in the end time brought a message to rebuild that statue of a perfect man amen the hands of Jer zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands also shall finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plumet now some of you old older ones Gary you you use a plum Bob I'm sure he has a plummet plummet is according to the definition in the Bible is a level a leveling device okay right but also it's a squaring device cuz when that cities built for square remember this pyramid is not three- sided it has four sides justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and the word the word had to come in end time sure it's got three sides here but it's a foursided pyramid because the city was built Four Square not three Square Four Square so it's got four corners to it right I didn't know if you knew that or not some people think well no it's just three no it's four square all right but shall see the plummet well the plummet or Plum Bob that we used I've used them a long time ago helping Dad it's a string with a heavy piece on the end of it with a with a stick or or actually it's made out of Brass A lot of them were and they came down to a point well when you got it exactly right you'd pop it in the ground and that was your corner and it was level and straight well that's what zerubabel was coming to do zerubabel in the hands of zerubabel with those seven so it wasn't just him there was seven others that help him built it but type you see Jesus Christ and the Seven Church age Messengers they are the eyes of the Lord right which run to and fro through the whole earth or you can take zerubabel and those seven cuz remember there's seven ads right all right really cuz you add to your faith 1 2 3 4 5 six seven right everybody got that amen add to your faith virt you all the way up to Pyramid all right so you shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel and those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth all right let's go to Isaiah 28 and 16 got it therefore thus sayith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone right now what is a stone in the Bible Revelation right all right Upon This Rock upon this Revelation uh we were talking you know earlier uh the brother brought out in the um at the watch Night Service uh most people don't realize that that Peter didn't answer what Jesus said right there in there in in the in where he read it where who do I who do you say I the son of man am right he said there are the Christ the son of the Living God it was the son of God Revelation not the son of man revelation right cuz the son of mar Revelation was hidden but God said I'll build my church on that Foundation or that Revelation which is the Son of God remember he died Ro he died son of man Rose Son of God he was Son of God through seven Church ages all right the son of man Revelation did not come back until the end time when that headstone left when he ascended he took that cap with him amen we're going to see it in a minute and he took that cap with him and it didn't come back until the end time amen that's the way we see it here that's just the way I see it but the foundation was what Peter said he said Upon This Rock or Foundation I'll build my church so he built the church on the revelation of the Son of God Amen not the son of man the Son of God all right which is God Spirit God all right which is the Holy Ghost down through seven Church ages all right does everybody understand that say amen amen all right so now where were we Isaiah 28:16 therefore thus sayith the Lord God behold I lay in Z for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste all right so there's a promise there he that believeth shall not make haste so now let's put the chart up the first chart and we're going to look and and kind of piece this thing together for you cuz there's a lot said about headstone there's a lot said about Cornerstone there's a lot said about this and that and the other so let's just kind of as we said as an introduction if we don't get finished I like this if we don't get finished we'll start again this afternoon okay we listen for for purpose of of leaving the church ages and the church age Messengers off because we're not going to deal with that you should know who the first church age messenger and what the and what the Ephesus and irenius Smyrna and all through that we're dealing with with us the Statue of a perfect man are the virtues so this is the statue of a perfect man this is Jesus Christ the fullness cuz remember he was the fullness of the godhead bodly right father son holy ghost He was all of it this was every bit God right here when he was standing on Earth that pyramid was standing on the Earth right amen that pyramid in its fullness was standing on the earth in a man called Jesus Christ the son of man right all right so we see that now we start here you got Foundation zerubabel laid the foundation and built the building all right Jesus Christ laid the foundation foundation of the Apostles and Prophets who Jesus Christ we'll read it in a minute being the Chief Cornerstone so now when but let's go back here now this is the fullness this is what should be now in the end time amen but take that away watch this that's what we have right through the church agents this is what we have right that all right this is what we have right here right The Headstone was rejected thrown out thrown out of the church he was thrown out of everything but now remember coming up through all the church ages they had some of these virtues it wasn't they just stayed down here at Faith Martin Luther didn't just have faith Martin Luther had to have virtue so people could draw off of the message that he was preaching and receive strength from that message right so he had certain parts of these but not the fullness right the faith of the fathers had been had been man's ideas had eroded this statue statue cuz that's what you're looking at a statue but it's the stature is the growth development but they took that man Jesus Christ and they ate the effects you can't eat the word down you eat the effects of the word right it was the effects of the word that they ate down Through the Ages The Headstone was rejected brother Bram said gone no way for man to get it back so there's no way for the completeness like we were talking before the true token brother BR you know the token didn't come to the end time well they had the token in the first church Age The Tokens of baptism of the Holy Ghost and I was telling somebody the other day and I think it really helped them maybe it was downstairs because remember what's the token the token was the blood that was applied on the doorpost that if you were inside that house you were protected right right exactly right now in the end time the true token was the man hanging at Calvary and brother Brown said the bride is the blood by the spirit we're not just the ones that's being protected by the blood we are the blood right right right amen by the spirit not the literal blood but the Blood by the spirit the spirit that we have Was the Same Spirit that was hanging on Calvary amen right Same Spirit we have the same spirit that was hanging on Calvary that shed his blood so that we can have not just our sins covered see that covered them in Egypt that covered what was behind that door that's not what God wanted right he wanted that Holy Ghost Veil like brother William was he wanted that Holy Ghost Veil back on the people not just covering the people blood of bulls and goats covered sin that's right blood of Jesus Christ takes that sin away right and then we become the blood by the spirit because we have been washed in his blood amen that's the only reason we can stay clean is that we have become the blood glory amen so that puts it back in real order when you bring the headstone back you've brought the blood back you brought everything back or the blood by the spirit not the literal blood right literal blood of Jesus is down still here still on the earth laying somewhere right all right cuz it broke down chemically down in the in the earth it wasn't that literal blood that saved you anyway right it was Faith In The Blood amen right faith in what he done so you go right back down to here you go back down to Faith so down through the church ages that's what it looks like but now as we read here in Ephesians or in Isaiah I lay in z a foundation a Stone a trid stone a precious Cornerstone of sure Foundation now what happened was watch and we're going to go to Ephesians 2 and 19 but don't don't go away from it yet what happened is he went away but remember he came right back on the day of Pentecost that same headstone came on the day of Pentecost but in the form that they could understand amen down in the church a down in the first church age all right so now let's go to Ephesians 2:19 now therefore ye Are No More Strangers but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone that's right in whom all the building Hey listen without a foundation and without a corner remember brother Brown said it's it's it's easy to make a straight line I can hand straight line but when you get into a corner to get that corner straight you got to have zerubabel with that plummet right to make everything where it'll square up because if you don't you'll get over there to the other end and you'll be off right every which way all right in whom all the building fitly framed together now there's the frame framed together groweth groweth that's an ongoing thing groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord and whom ye also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit amen so The Headstone has now become the Cornerstone all right put that up put the next one up just for illustration purposes and it's really neat to see that it is the head's down at the corner now everybody see that right is that okay that's what he means by being the Cornerstone he was the head he was the head a little pyramid in itself he was the head but now he's become the corner the one that laid the foundation it's the same love that you get at faith that you get up here it's not a different love it's a different level right or a different manifestation of that love all right so you got down here that's the Chief Cornerstone but now what he's going to do is in the end time he's not going to come from away from that and make that a circle or a square no but he's going to come right back up here to where he was amen amen and there then you say the the true token or the token came at the end time all right which was not just that we were covered by the blood that but that we are the blood by the spirit of God 1 Peter 2 and 1 now Peter continues now this is First Peter 2 and one the first one he written before wrote before he wrote the uh second Peter wherefore laying aside all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere me milk of the word that you may grow thereby so Peter brought him right back down to the foundation if so be that word if so be that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as into a living Stone disallowed indeed of men right headstone was rejected right of men disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God in Precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house un holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also as also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion we read in Isaiah a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded it's going to clear up a lot of things amen this statue of a perfect man to me if it's taught well and taught right it clears up a lot of things amen right unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made head of the corner back back down there to the be to the beginning but watch what it becomes if you don't get into that stone okay that's what I've always said about the light a light can do two things a light can light your path or it can blind you right if you become the light as he is the light if you become the flashlight you can never have your light put out you can never be blinded if you become the flashlight right cuz the light's always in front of you but if you are not part of that and you're looking back into the light you're going to be blinded a stone of stumbling a rock of offense and even to them which stumble at the word amen ex that's what we see now in the end time and all down through they there's been there's been people come and go all through church ages this ain't something new that people are leaving the message no they left Luther's message they left Wesley's message they left Pentecost they left all different messages this is not something new the same devil just a different name right all right the people are dead and gone on but the devil he just had die he just came and jumped over in somebody else right A Stone of stumbling a rock of offence so in other words if we don't get into this if we don't get into this it actually is a stumbling Stone it is a rock of offense all right even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient now come on being disob obedient where unto also they were appointed right but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show see where I got that show forth show it you got to show it outwardly show forth the praise of him who ha called you out of Darkness into his Marv marous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God there was one time that we were the people of the devil whatever you think about yourself you once were the devil's property amen but now you're the people of God right which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy all right so we come to this place to where the stone can be a stone that is like um Dave Ramy made this analogy which I really enjoyed uh he said that a brick and I've told you many times before but some new ones here A brick is aoral you know you have moral and immoral right you have morals and you have immorality there's something in between it's called amoral a brick is aoral money is aoral money has no morals a gun is a moral a gun has no morals a gun doesn't arbitrarily shoot you it takes a hand of somebody to use it same way with a brick a brick is aoral you can take that brick and throw it through that window and cause a crime and be put in jail or you can take that same brick and build a hospital to house children that are sick so the brick is it's it's all in the hands of the user same thing with money money can be a sin or or a curse or it can be a blessing one of the two it's what you do with it same thing with these virtues same thing with God glory you stand with a choice to use what God's give you or not use what God give you okay I want us all to be skillful and have have not just the knowledge of the truth but let that truth flow through us and and I've seen in the Sunday school class and and not bragging on myself at all but in that Sunday school class seeing people be enlightened seeing people grow um seeing people become more aware at least if if if we sometimes as ministers we just try to make you aware we can't help you right we can guide you right but we can't help you right cuz I can say look the best way to go to Gainesville is right down here and go get on the interstate and somebody says no it's not you get out here and that's all Road well you can get to gangel the same way but you're going to get there 10 minutes quicker going that way than this way but you know what you got to choose which way you go same way with God we still as free moral agents up to the day we our bodies change we are free moral agents we make a choice whether to do the things of God or not and we get the promises or we get the woes one of the two amen we get the promises or the wo one of the two all right it's what we decide but we are now the people of God now let's go to Galatians 3 21 and we're going to let this is what we were reading last night in Sunday School in the Bible study and we we kind of got off of it a little bit cuz I said I'm going to cover it today but we starting in Galatians 3 and we're going to read right through Galatians 4 because this is what this is what's going to happen this is from our new birth and and how that God's going to raise us up Galatians 3:21 is the law then against the promises of God God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life very verily righteousness should have been by the law remember law was not life the way man took it you hear what I said the way man took it it was death because it was dos and don'ts all right but it's the way man took it that way but the scripture ha concluded all under sin pretty good isn't it none good know not one so if you think you were born with some Eternal something in you and your neighbor wasn't then God's a respect your persons and that scripture's dead I just like to see that we're all C we're all sin until God comes to me that's righteousness that's judgment that's everything uh that's pure of God is that he did not arbitrarily pick me over my neighbor just CU he wanted to cuz remember we come back to free moral agency we come back to our free moral ability to choose or to reject now God knowing we would choose he had it for us there where you call it seed or whatever I I just I just think we all born in sin we all born dead then God come that's right then the life of God come but the scripture ha concluded all under sin that the promise of faith of Jesus Christ might be given to what them that believe so there's a group that's going to believe and he's got it there for them to believe all right everybody all right say amen amen all right but before Faith came we were kept under the law dos and don't right we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed right all right wherefore the law was our school Master that's what we talking about last night back in the old times you had a school master or they used to call him a school mm it was the old woman or the old C you the a man that was not your teacher he was the school master right he was the head Deacon he was the one that kept you in line yeah if you got out of line the teacher would either send him to you kind of like the principal of today the the the the teacher would send them to the principal well the wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ but it couldn't get us in Christ okay cuz it wasn't the teacher cuz we're going to cover that in just a minute okay so the law like I said the here's the law the law is out here right dos and don'ts do this don't do that even in justification and sanctification it is dos and don'ts right was for me it's got to be for you same thing we all become lawgivers when we become religious right but when we get born again we try to pick up a little bit of Grace but before Faith came we were kept under the the law shut up un the faith that would be afterward be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith right but after that faith has come we're no longer under School Master it's When Faith Comes we're no longer under School Master right no longer under School master for ye are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now remember Paul watch He's continuing this thought that's why I want to continue to read this there's neither Jew or Greek Bond or free male or female for you are all one in Jesus or Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise there's your new birth now I say that the heir aans 4:1 continue the thought keep going 4:1 now I say that the heir as long as he is a child dith nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all now once you get born again right here at Faith you are a son and daughter of God Amen you are in the Kingdom you are a bride you are the elect lady you are Eternal in your soul right there's a lot of things goes with that just getting in the Kingdom but I say that the heir as long as he's a child now look what did the prodal son do he was a son he was an heir he went out and privilously spent his money and did all the things of the world right he didn't obtain this he was a son but he did but remember he came back all right he came back and he was restored amen but watch that the heir as long as he's a child differeth nothing from a servant right though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father amen even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world that's right okay but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons now remember down here we receive the spirit of adoption Romans 8 right Romans 8 we receive the the spirit of adoption we're in line we're in air right we're in line to be adopted all right not an adoption like today that's different from adoption back then adoption today of today is of course many different things but the adoption in the Old Testament was you took a son and like brother brandom Illustrated he said he said here's the father of course the trinitarians love this here's the father setting up in the Kingdom and The Holy Ghost comes to him and said why two of them but the holy ghost would come he's given an illustration he just given an illustration so that we can understand it okay it's an illustration the Holy Ghost comes and tells the father oh dick Addison you ought to see him he's doing well I don't think the father don't see that it's an illustration right right but now oh look at wayale he's over there he's doing things bad you know father's you know that's why the scripture says you can grieve the Holy Spirit even though you have the Holy Spirit you can grieve it you can grieve it so bad you'll not get those virtues not all of them anyway right but you still are a child of God you say well what do I need then I'm I'm Eternal what I need anything see if you got that attitude I don't think you are right right I don't think you are if you got that if I'm if I become if I realized just just let me let me give you an analysis here if I was if I found out today that I was the son of Bill Gates now I know what Dad said but let me use this analogy if I found out I was the very direct son of Bill Gates I'd want some money cuz he is my daddy right but same way with God here we come down through the world and we're the Father the devil I mean the devil's our daddy right Devil's our daddy then one day we realize come to an altar give our heart to God and we realize that that Kingdom has changed right that Kingdom has changed and now it takes on a different look right well let me tell you something just as you wanted everything that the devil had when you was doing his bidding I want everything that the Eternal God has everything without limitation I mean we wanted to drink and smoke and do the things of the world we wanted to do that don't tell me you didn't whing around with women and all the different things we wanted to do that or we wouldn't have done it but now that we we come to a place where God has took that nature out give us a new nature his nature Glory we got a kingdom now that's full of promises right we got a kingdom now that that not even the great Apostle Paul could teach and put it together even like you and I can today amen I heard a preacher one time preach that Paul had everything we had I don't agree with that I don't agree with that cuz Paul didn't have that statue of a perfect man with the headstone he didn't have a son of man Revelation right the son of man Revelation is only people to us in the end time to change our bodies that's what the son of man Revelation because remember the Son of God doesn't need a body change right son of God's God Amen Son of God don't need a body change the son of man needed a body Chang and he got one because the Son of God was in that son of man and he yielded himself to that personen what's the difference between me and you right if we're hes Romans 8 says we're HS and join HS with Christ that doesn't mean he's up here we're down here that means join HS whatever he's got we can get amen but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we we were children were in bondage of the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Daddy Daddy all right wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ an heir of God through Christ so if if if Jesus Christ had got eternal life and Jesus Christ was these virtues if you have Jesus Christ in you then it will make you the Bible says it will make you that you will neither be baren or unfruitful all right so we're going to read one quote and then we're going to stop I kind of Promise myself I try not to go about an hour and 10 minutes this whole time so I've been about an hour and 8 minutes so let's read one quote and then we'll pick this up tonight or this evening and and listen probably in about a couple more weeks we'll have a questions and answer session just in case you had a question that you want to ask about certain things that we're that we're speaking on but do me a favor study study this out this is important this is important it's very important come to church be a part A whole part not just a half a part statue of perfect man we're going to read this one and then we'll we'll review this evening and finish the rest of it now look paragraph 31 statute of a perfect man this was preached in 1962 1014 now we are approaching the Seven Seals we have just finished the seven Church ages and this is a message message on teaching that ties the man in he's talking about statute of perfect man don't he said this is what's TI this tie the man in all right so he's going through the seals then he's going to tie the man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and going to be in that church age that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals so this is a tie end so now let us read first Peter second Peter rather the first portion of it then he reads and I'm going to read it like he reads it okay let me read it like he's reading it then we'll stop right here and pick it up this afternoon Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained light precious Faith through us with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ he's reading the scripture now he's going to comment I like the way that stated there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith see let me read that again listen close Simon Peter a servant Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that obtain obtained like Precious Faith through the righteousness of God our savior and Jesus Christ notice he is saying that I have obtained this faith and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained that light precious faith I want it's not to the outside world GL this is to the church see those that are in Christ am all right Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God through through of Jesus Christ Our Lord now he's this he's reading the scripture according to his divine power has given unto us all things his divine power now has given unto us all things that pertain unto life godliness through the knowledge of him that's called us to glory and virtue whereby are we given unto given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he and he comments these promises all right down here these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature now let's go on to paragraph 36 now let that soak in real deep now not preaching this morning we just teaching this lesson divine div nature see that's his lesson is divine nature that is the divine nature of God by the way let me read that fourth verse again so you won't miss it whereby we are given whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way Glory what is God's requirement right there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to become more like Christ now it's laid out here amen every Christian I'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid they're probably the oldest in the building but if I ask them what's in your heart's desire it'd be closer to God when you learn of Christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him amen so that's what I mean about desire if if we have a desire God will fill it amen if if we have a desire just to come to church and brother juel and I were talking about something the other day and we were talking about a social gospel and that's exactly what's happening around the message people are just preaching a social gospel come to church just like the denominations and sing two or three songs and or what more not saying what we do I'm saying what they they go they have the doxology they sing a few songs they have this they say the preacher gets up he talks for 15 minutes and they go home ain't much what we don't do what we do this is given to us to move with to move up in God with let's stand if your desire is to move up with God because this whole thing begins with a desire where that you want to be fruitful and abound and all those great things divine nature come on musicians if you want that then God's here to give it to youen but if you want to just be somebody just sits in church and just you know says amen every once in a while and you know you can be that but you're not going to be fruitful God wants somebody he can use and I'll promise you one thing let me nail this down real good you will not take a body change if you do not have these virtues working in your life amen you will not take a body change if you do not have these virtues working in your life you are headed to a grave that's to all of us if you don't have those virtues working in your life you're headed to a grave right think about that amen so are those a requirement right absolutely they're a requirement to me it's life and death right it's a life and death requirement but you know what God never gives a man a requirement that that he doesn't make a way to get out of that woe part of the requirement God never does that he's never give anybody and says well that's just it you're done you're finished no he says he well word if if you believe in me you'll have everlasting life let's power our heads de heavenly father thank you Lord this morning that you've come Among Us and Lord to open your word to our hearts and may it sink deep into all of us Lord that we consecrate oursel here at the beginning of the year not making a New Year's resolution but consecrating oursel more to you that we'll live more closer to you live more like
