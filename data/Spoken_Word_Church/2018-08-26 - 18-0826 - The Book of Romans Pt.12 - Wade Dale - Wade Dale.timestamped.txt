[0:00] go ahead to edit everything but not me
[0:08] last Sunday y'all will let me leave it
[0:11] running and it ran the whole service let
[0:16] me know it well I usually have support
[0:25] that helps me and yes exactly
[0:33] my right hand folks weren't here I want
[0:36] to introduce your fav you not met
[0:37] brother Russ dunker they said brother
[0:39] Russ doctor he's from Minnesota he's
[0:41] here with us for the weekend and greet
[0:45] you in the name of the Lord and we're
[0:47] going to get started so he watches
[0:48] online so he probably knows most of the
[0:50] anyway so he he's uh he's not a stranger
[0:53] he's just one of those oh and good night
[1:19] so gathering together unto Him I think
[1:23] we're gettin together I really do
[1:26] go in the book of Romans don't you me
[1:28] they'd have been here you know that you
[1:30] win chapter 8 which is a very beautiful
[1:34] chapter chapter 8 if we like last Sunday
[1:38] we went back to chapter 7 because
[1:40] remember chapters in the Bible were put
[1:44] in by man Paul was just writing a letter
[1:46] he just continually wrote a letter man
[1:49] put the verses in and man put two
[1:51] chapters in so watch what he says in 24
[1:55] Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall
[1:56] deliver me from the body of this dead
[1:59] now remember let me back up for a minute
[2:02] I find that along with when I would do
[2:05] good evil is present with me now here we
[2:08] go to the compartmentalizing of of what
[2:12] he's talking about
[2:13] Paul is not talking about he's lost so
[2:17] Paul of soul is redeemed born-again
[2:19] eternal as God is it is done can't sin
[2:23] can't make an error cannot be evil
[2:25] cannot be wrong never had a bad thought
[2:28] eternal right because he's born he's a
[2:32] born-again believer so he's eternal so
[2:33] what's he talking about
[2:34] I find that a law that when I do good
[2:37] evil is present with me
[2:39] now let's go over to the flesh it's not
[2:41] the flesh the flesh just a product the
[2:43] product of sin but you don't sin with
[2:47] your flesh you sell hope yeah you did
[2:50] but it's motivated by what that
[2:53] middleman is and if you're not born
[2:56] again you're motivated by the soul which
[2:58] is evil so Paul is not saying evil is
[3:03] prevalent but if you and I will agree
[3:06] 100 percent of us will agree that in our
[3:09] spirit realm before Satan yes pound on
[3:14] God's in the soul is eternal they can't
[3:18] touch you but he can touch that spirit
[3:20] man because Paul can't say evil is
[3:23] present with me and be talking about his
[3:26] soul no he's talking
[3:27] about the second round of memory
[3:29] reasoning conscious affection
[3:31] imagination those five things are our
[3:34] problem right so if you're born again
[3:38] your soul that's problem it's old God
[3:43] your body is just holding everything
[3:45] together it came because the product of
[3:46] mom and daddy getting together producing
[3:48] the flesh no next Sunday we'll read in
[3:51] for steel for brother Ram talks about
[3:54] how it should have been had they not
[3:56] been a fall we would not have come with
[3:57] a with a sex act we would have come by
[4:03] Spoken work right God would have spoken
[4:06] God what spoke to Adam come see us the
[4:08] way it does God spoke to Moses most
[4:09] spoke Aaron and give it to the people
[4:11] that's just the way it is right same way
[4:14] within the Garden of Eden God spoke to
[4:17] Apple Adam had the thought Adam with God
[4:19] on the earth and he was to produce all
[4:21] of the board all the people that are now
[4:23] born again this was before the fall so
[4:26] that's the way we would have come but we
[4:29] didn't call it income this way no I said
[4:31] in his room did we all came born in sin
[4:34] saying iniquity as popular money woman
[4:36] coming earth : - the pollens not a liar
[4:41] and that he's this man's a prophet and
[4:44] he's writing the Bible so he's not
[4:46] saying that evil is present in me as far
[4:49] as in my soul no he's a born-again
[4:52] believer leave that thing along because
[4:55] then you know really back in here we we
[4:57] went through all this for now I know
[5:01] that in me that is in my flesh not the
[5:03] flash because remember your flesh does
[5:05] not sin nope he's less tense in your
[5:12] flesh manifests what sin is inside of
[5:15] you
[5:15] right I mean I'll explain it one more
[5:21] time you say what an honest and with my
[5:25] flash Jesus walked up to the Pharisees
[5:28] and the Pharisees said we've never
[5:30] touched a woman we don't commit adultery
[5:33] you can't accuse us committee go because
[5:35] I never touched or had an affair
[5:39] in my flesh Jesus said that's alright
[5:44] but I say unto thee if you look on a
[5:48] woman memory of reason comes it's facing
[5:50] the imagination you look on a woman
[5:54] you've already committed adultery in
[5:56] your heart so it ain't kind of to do
[5:59] with that we bet people have been
[6:01] beating on the flesh and this message
[6:02] for years and that just a waste of time
[6:04] a waste of time this you can't get the
[6:07] person born again and then get that
[6:09] spirit lined up with the size of a
[6:11] perfect man listen even Jesus's flesh
[6:14] was dying he was Almighty God in human
[6:17] flesh and that human flesh was dying he
[6:20] had to take a bath he had to go to the
[6:21] bathroom he was ever more human but that
[6:25] soul and the spirit inside that man was
[6:27] Almighty God he was born around way he
[6:29] was born spoken word commended for I
[6:33] know that in me that is in my flesh not
[6:36] my flesh dwelleth no good thing for the
[6:39] will is present with me but how to
[6:41] perform that which is good I find not
[6:44] you talking about the soul no he's
[6:48] talking about let the soul live because
[6:51] he always goes through and says it's not
[6:53] how that liveth Christ it lived in me
[6:56] because watch this wholesome if you take
[6:59] this right here and you stop at the end
[7:00] of chapter 7 we're all off there's no
[7:04] way I mean not lost in the soul I'm no
[7:07] math you know your spirit will never be
[7:09] under suggestion okay good luck for the
[7:14] good that I would I do not for the good
[7:17] of one for the souls for the good that I
[7:19] would do I don't do why but the evil
[7:22] which I would not that I do that middle
[7:24] man now if I do that I wouldn't I it is
[7:28] no more I that do it but sin that
[7:30] dwelleth in me now he's not talking
[7:32] about in his soul he's talking about his
[7:37] middle man the memory reason convicts
[7:39] imagination I find it all then when I
[7:42] would do good evil is present with me
[7:45] Brian delight in the law of God after
[7:48] what n-word man he goes all the way
[7:50] inside to the soul but I see another law
[7:55] come back he's gonna come back out and
[7:57] live with human life he's gonna have a
[7:58] human spirit another law in my members
[8:01] warring against the law of my mind bring
[8:05] him and the captivity to the law sin
[8:07] which is in my members no wretched man
[8:11] that I am Who Shall deliver me from the
[8:13] body of this death question mark I thank
[8:16] God through Jesus Christ our Lord so
[8:18] then with the mind I myself serve the
[8:20] law of God but with the flesh the law
[8:23] sin Paul like brother Rev Sekou he goes
[8:29] out on a limb he says ah but there is
[8:34] therefore now no condemnation now he was
[8:38] condemning himself the whole chapter 7
[8:42] the middle man he was condemning today
[8:45] he was condemning itself there is
[8:47] therefore now no condemnation to them
[8:50] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[8:52] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[8:56] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[8:58] middle man inside me has made me free
[9:02] from the law of sin and death for what
[9:05] the law could not do in that it was weak
[9:07] through the flesh do's and don'ts God
[9:12] sending his own son in the likeness of
[9:14] sinful flesh likeness of sinful flesh
[9:16] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[9:19] and I want to read this in - and the
[9:21] Greek because it's really really neat to
[9:23] to listen to this so we'll go back to
[9:25] verse 1 there is then no condemnation
[9:29] now - those are India who are in the
[9:32] anointed Jesus for the law of the spirit
[9:39] of life by the anointed Jesus liberated
[9:42] me from the law of sin death this is the
[9:45] actual letter that was written this is
[9:47] the King James Version that they Frank
[9:49] to make you understand a little bit
[9:51] better but I'm reading from the Greek
[9:52] dialogue which is the original written
[9:55] straight off of what Paul wrote okay
[9:59] Joel the witness has a fight you can't
[10:04] okay
[10:05] but it's the it's a die glut and I got
[10:08] the bigger one there's a small one this
[10:09] is the big one so okay I can read okay
[10:13] so now verse two what for the law of the
[10:16] spirit of life by the anointed Jesus
[10:17] liberated me from the law sin and death
[10:20] verse 3 for what was impossible for the
[10:24] law and then it was wheat to the flesh
[10:26] why was the law impossible why why was
[10:29] the law the ultimate because it only
[10:36] covered your sin if it only covered your
[10:39] stance what we'll talk about last night
[10:40] if it only covers your sin you got to
[10:45] come out of that somewhere and it's old
[10:48] thirty because the life of the animal
[10:51] couldn't come back into the person to
[10:54] eradicate or clean that soul but when
[10:56] Jesus died he was able to come back
[10:58] because he was eternal that eternal life
[11:01] to come back into the believer wash him
[11:03] away and there's now for now knows
[11:05] everyone now no condemnation but your
[11:07] sins in the Sea of God's forget one it's
[11:09] never be remembered again for what the
[11:12] law could not do for what was impossible
[11:15] for the law in that it was weak to the
[11:17] flesh God having sent his own son in a
[11:21] form of the flesh of sin even
[11:24] parentheses by offering for sin condense
[11:27] them in and then condemned sin in the
[11:30] flesh
[11:33] so he's condemned sin in the flesh
[11:36] there's therefore now become
[11:39] I realize that I don't want to read you
[11:41] the Greek in force over for for so the
[11:48] righteousness of the law may be
[11:49] fulfilled by us who are walking not
[11:52] according to flesh but according to
[11:55] spirit all right that the righteousness
[11:58] of the law might be fulfilled because
[12:00] remember Jesus didn't do away with the
[12:03] law he made an honor well we're the only
[12:06] ones that can live the law we're the
[12:07] only ones that can can not you know we
[12:11] don't live the ten suggestion we live in
[12:13] Commandments you know though most of the
[12:17] worldly up to ten suggestions they said
[12:19] yes thou shalt not kill thou shalt not
[12:21] steal
[12:22] you covet your neighbor haul it up stuff
[12:24] you know they just suggestion but do we
[12:28] live in flesh no we don't live in the
[12:30] flesh you know what this program you
[12:35] come up here to brotherly kindness when
[12:38] the brother Dale will get to it he's
[12:40] talking about you know having brotherly
[12:41] kindness then he talks about not
[12:44] physically killing a brother but
[12:47] spiritually killing him or talking about
[12:49] him or saying something bad about him
[12:51] anyone cured you kill his spirit he said
[12:53] you've killed that person alright so you
[12:55] don't physically kill anybody now you
[12:56] don't have to you can kill them in the
[13:00] spirit realm killer influence because if
[13:03] you kill influence you kill the person
[13:08] but what for they that are after the
[13:11] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[13:13] that listen you know what we do we mind
[13:15] the things of the flesh because we live
[13:18] in the flesh we rather than a wild worm
[13:20] father were kind word whatever title you
[13:25] want to say let it after the flesh do
[13:28] mind the things of the flesh for their
[13:29] the spirit after the things of the
[13:30] spirit that's where you have to get your
[13:33] balance for those who live according to
[13:36] flesh are minding the things of the
[13:38] flesh but those who live according to
[13:41] the spirit the things of the spirit now
[13:43] watch for the fortress for to be
[13:45] carnally minded is death but to be
[13:49] spiritually minded is life and peace
[13:52] now one's carnal mind carnal mind is
[13:54] what enmity to God so there was no way
[13:56] that God's going to contact you now he's
[13:59] got to go through your mind but the
[14:03] problem is even was in this force field
[14:05] man was so carnally minded until they
[14:07] took on doctrines that are not a God let
[14:12] didn't come from God it came from a
[14:13] carnal mind all right which carnal is
[14:17] what earthly fleshly all right as for
[14:20] down here for to be carnally minded is
[14:21] death but to be spiritually minded is
[14:23] life and peace let me read to this
[14:25] for the mind of the flesh is death but
[14:28] the mind of the Spirit is life in peace
[14:31] because the mind of the flesh is enmity
[14:34] to God for the law of God it is not
[14:36] subject nor indeed can it be because the
[14:40] carnal mind is enmity against God it is
[14:42] not subject to the law of God neither
[14:44] indeed can be so then they that are in
[14:47] the flesh cannot please God you said
[14:52] well we can and you know what though we
[14:55] can't please God in the flesh that's why
[14:58] everybody's trying to say well long hair
[15:00] long dress don't paint your face but but
[15:04] live like you know be black inside you
[15:07] know the soul would be rotting and they
[15:09] just live it because so-and-so said it
[15:11] and because someone so said it because
[15:13] you know because we got it preached to
[15:15] it for about ten or fifteen years and it
[15:20] really doesn't do any good you have your
[15:23] hair dragging the ground and still dying
[15:27] old hell that's right so so then that
[15:31] there in the flesh cannot please God but
[15:33] you're not in the flesh but in the
[15:35] spirit look yes big word right there yes
[15:42] because what Paul says but you're not in
[15:44] the flesh but in the spirit yeah that
[15:49] spirit is in you if so be that the
[15:52] Spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[15:56] man have not the Spirit of Christ is
[15:58] enough in other words you know
[16:00] the God unless you're born again in
[16:01] yourself right and if Christ be in you
[16:06] the body is dead because of sin but why
[16:10] we worried about the body for all these
[16:12] years
[16:13] forget the body until we come to a body
[16:15] change it's just going to keep getting
[16:16] over and over and over but the soul
[16:22] inside is eternal we just need to let
[16:24] that person out start working out start
[16:28] working their way out through our
[16:31] memories and concerts effects and
[16:32] imagination because remember God
[16:34] contacts you through those things I mean
[16:38] I sat down this morning and worked on
[16:40] the sermon but it was a sermon of what
[16:43] I've been thinking about all week so in
[16:44] my mind I was thinking about what I was
[16:48] thinking about back on Monday fuse means
[16:51] Thursday Friday right so you have to use
[16:54] your mind but now that mind also can be
[16:57] carnal and some big old bad often has
[17:00] come into the week to all so anyway just
[17:03] God in there you know the devil comes in
[17:05] and goes yeah yeah wait for them big
[17:09] words only you know that you don't use
[17:11] any more than you so why bother
[17:13] yeah they don't bother you the devil's
[17:16] already got you come on
[17:20] we were in a youth camp one time when I
[17:22] firmly told some of you Big Brother
[17:25] dating steamin was preaching and that
[17:26] was probably 600 people never to lose
[17:29] he he said I own all the preachers in
[17:34] here there was about 25 of us to stand
[17:37] up so we all stood up all the kids look
[17:40] he said I wanna ask y'all how many of
[17:43] you have had a bad thought today they
[17:48] don't raise the name they said how many
[17:52] of you have had a bad thought while you
[17:55] were preaching we all raised our then
[17:59] and the kids are going he said how many
[18:03] of you had a bat doll I used praying for
[18:05] somebody we all raised their hand
[18:10] so you know that kind of give the when
[18:14] his point was is that we're not don't
[18:16] put us up here don't put them don't put
[18:18] the ministry the only difference between
[18:19] me and you is it does give me a gift to
[18:21] say something that you might be able to
[18:22] understand other than that then didn't
[18:26] and you know I'm just as much of them
[18:28] it's gonna take my graces then you be a
[18:30] pleasure Satan actually jumps on me a
[18:33] lot of times before he does you know
[18:36] cuz I'm trying to study for a sermon and
[18:39] all heck breaks loose in your brain you
[18:42] know don't have to it can be common
[18:43] everything around you in Louise you
[18:46] don't know we all know that if you don't
[18:48] know that by now then really there's
[18:50] something wrong with you but you have to
[18:52] believe though compartmentalize it
[18:54] because that didn't come from your soul
[18:55] now when I was a sinner I knew where
[18:58] that came from because that's what
[18:59] controlled me I let it control me yes
[19:03] same way with Paul when Paul was
[19:05] condemning Christians and causing them
[19:08] to blaspheme and putting them to death
[19:10] God wasn't in Paul's so you'd say
[19:13] whatever you want to you bribe can't
[19:16] persecute bride so Paul was under the
[19:19] assumption though if he was religious
[19:21] it's that's why Paul can say what he did
[19:24] in Romans said he knew what he did he
[19:28] who will through that he knew he was a
[19:31] sinner he
[19:32] knew that he put people to death they
[19:34] had what he had now he didn't he didn't
[19:37] have a bad thing
[19:38] but now he also knew that he paid I got
[19:42] a conversion but he didn't convert the
[19:44] whole man right
[19:46] it didn't convert the whole man what's
[19:49] pretty honey in there I took this big
[19:52] picture when I did that's actually my
[19:54] honey I'll cook picked it up for the
[19:55] picture so Paul is the best one it can
[20:01] write what do you were I believe God
[20:04] couldn't use nobody else so you use the
[20:06] man that that even think about for an
[20:09] eyes when we know I told him city Paul's
[20:14] coming to see you you pray for it how
[20:17] about if I was like a Bible and I said
[20:19] Lord you is this the same saw that we're
[20:22] running from that we're hiding from the
[20:25] Lord says you know I'm a really damn
[20:27] because the Lord said and nice calm down
[20:30] calm down you need to pray for him yeah
[20:35] you see so even Paul had to come see
[20:38] somebody in the head like to get like to
[20:43] get the Holy Ghost but once he did see
[20:45] once he did now he's going hey we still
[20:47] got work today we still got work today
[20:51] even Peter Peter said you know being
[20:53] born again that's what this whole thing
[20:55] is it's not that you getting born again
[20:58] in your soul over and over and over
[21:00] again your birthday these virtues into
[21:02] you yes right and that's helping take
[21:06] the middle man the spirit man and turn
[21:09] it in to what the inside
[21:14] that's what this statue a purple man's
[21:16] for you it's to turn that middleman
[21:19] forget about the flesh please forget
[21:22] about the flesh all the flesh made me
[21:25] the flesh didn't make you do anything
[21:26] like I said many times before you get
[21:31] somebody that's he's in the
[21:34] contract and he's you know from his
[21:36] spine down he can't live his money so he
[21:39] can't commit adultery can't do all these
[21:41] things that a sinner drink Smok custom
[21:43] but if he'd only said Jesus Christ in
[21:45] his soul doesn't matter one's body does
[21:48] okay so let's let's quit beating the
[21:50] flesh like we've done for years
[21:53] let's get inside that man and make him
[21:56] squirm now the problem is is we've made
[21:58] the flesh squirm for 20 years 30 years
[22:00] 40 years since the probably little you
[22:02] know beats flesh not listen yes beat the
[22:12] flesh we get this flash don't forget it
[22:16] for we are not in the flesh women let's
[22:19] go to verse 8 so then they are the end
[22:22] the flesh and the flesh cannot please
[22:24] God
[22:26] you know why we can't please God in the
[22:28] flesh not the flesh but the motivator
[22:33] because remember I told you before every
[22:36] time we have a bad dog that's not from
[22:38] God so that's not God right we're not
[22:43] pleasing God by them thought we're not
[22:46] pleasing God by living a human life it
[22:51] was supposed to be we weren't supposed
[22:53] to have to eat we weren't supposed to
[22:56] have to have a septic tank we were not
[23:01] supposed to be married the way we're
[23:03] married so that's all the carnal part
[23:06] that we do but you know what is you
[23:07] compartmental
[23:08] that said Louie sell something you think
[23:10] you come apartment but if you look
[23:12] compartmentalize it that way and say
[23:14] look the things that I have to do as a
[23:16] human being is right here I'm a human
[23:19] I'm in the first three dimensions I got
[23:23] trapped into doing this it was my mom
[23:25] and daddy's fault but God had us in the
[23:35] flesh because Adam and Eve sinned in the
[23:39] flesh see when you see serpents Eden I
[23:41] guess the sex act against the whole
[23:44] thing all the way down then you take it
[23:49] to the spiritual part and that's what
[23:51] we're looking at that right because we
[23:54] keep we're all born between Satan the
[23:56] knee because we were all born on the
[23:57] same site so just get over that okay get
[24:01] over that there's only one person that
[24:03] wasn't and he's the one that we're
[24:07] looking for and when he changes this
[24:09] back he's going to change us not throw
[24:12] this one away and brand another way he's
[24:13] actually sure sure sure absolutely the
[24:24] grapes like we were coming out last
[24:25] night foolish bird can come water my
[24:26] name being good all these different
[24:29] things they'll be given eternal life
[24:31] where if it just comes the way it was
[24:34] supposed to come only God's children
[24:36] would have been born they would have
[24:38] been nothing else but see to make the
[24:41] fullness of God manifest you had to be
[24:44] up here to be a redeemer a healer Savior
[24:49] I'm glad I came lost don't tell me you
[24:51] know a lot of people to mention say well
[24:52] I'm glad I came here with eternal life
[24:54] while you did I'm just gonna tell you
[24:57] you didn't you can say what you want do
[25:00] you did not come here with eternal life
[25:02] now we're to reach it yeah I've heard of
[25:06] myself preaching because of that seed
[25:08] thing well there's only one Steve mister
[25:10] word
[25:11] and wherever it followed me all my life
[25:14] the one man me it followed me yeah
[25:17] it followed me all my life and then one
[25:19] day I connected the one God knew I would
[25:22] want so I connected to and guess what it
[25:26] came from off the page into here the
[25:31] seed was laying there and you can say
[25:33] the seed was laying there but there was
[25:34] no light listen like Paul how could Paul
[25:37] persecute the very Christians that he
[25:39] was going to be if he had anything
[25:40] eternal in his in his song and it's just
[25:43] like me and Jim we're talking another
[25:44] day there's no way that we come any
[25:48] different than Judas Iscariot because
[25:49] you know what Judas Iscariot can walk up
[25:51] to the dead judgment and say now you
[25:54] told Bob black that he had this eternal
[25:58] scene in him and he always would be
[25:59] curling that means you think you
[26:02] mentioned and he would be what God would
[26:07] be just to give you to security kind of
[26:10] life because he came some way different
[26:12] than he did but no no everybody come off
[26:16] everybody was born sinners I don't care
[26:19] who you are so you don't want that
[26:21] covers and all and then when they come
[26:22] up to the dead judge but you just could
[26:24] say I did it it's my fault you can't say
[26:30] well but a mob hit or he made it and you
[26:33] even send a problem in that told him and
[26:34] he had this eternal dream and he was
[26:36] gonna make it all the way didn't matter
[26:38] what no that ain't what promising that
[26:41] would be car pulling in 30 min making
[26:43] you do something today so now he ain't
[26:44] that way no he knew you'd want it had it
[26:49] there for you and that's it I got a book
[26:51] preach and we gotta get back to sinus
[26:52] immediately
[26:53] well okay you're back son good plan but
[26:56] you're not in the flesh but in the
[26:57] spirit if you can't be in the spirit if
[27:03] you don't have God willed that spirit
[27:04] dwelling in you now you can have an
[27:06] anointing the true anointing of God you
[27:10] can have the true learning and be false
[27:12] I believe in like we said before even
[27:16] now not a denies the Christian but and
[27:18] that's the high priest that put Jesus on
[27:20] the cross God still honored your thought
[27:25] about that God still honored when he
[27:27] took that blood behind the mercy seat I
[27:29] mean he killed Jesus Christ or he you
[27:32] know you he wanted he did call him
[27:35] belzebub but because he was a hot breeze
[27:38] when he took the blood back if I start
[27:41] out to kill him while he was in there
[27:44] but he could because his life do you
[27:48] want to man his life was under the law
[27:51] blameless and asking that one mark they
[27:55] couldn't be one mark that's why they
[27:56] came down through in that priesthood
[27:58] there was no mark against him but the
[28:00] very thing and that's what we're gonna
[28:02] talk about this afternoon he was
[28:05] spiritually dead he was black there was
[28:08] nothing to him immediately he was he
[28:10] with God you are God knew before the
[28:12] foundation world and he would never what
[28:13] he said Jesus Christ beyond that so I
[28:16] had to me that's very simple
[28:18] yeah but ye are not in the flesh but in
[28:20] the spirit if so be that the Spirit of
[28:22] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[28:24] the Spirit of Christ he is none event
[28:27] that's pretty simple and if Christ be in
[28:31] you the body is dead because of sin now
[28:34] I'm dead know it don't hold the bear
[28:39] like it before it doesn't same hand same
[28:42] mouth it used the curse he just cleans
[28:45] it up same way what he's gonna do with
[28:47] the earth like we've come about last
[28:49] night heaven and earth will pass away it
[28:51] took a prophet
[28:52] tell us that that main explosion and
[28:54] doing away and God create he thought
[28:56] will create another earth but the Bible
[28:59] says I created a new heaven and new
[29:01] earth they took a prophet to tell us
[29:03] though that that part create was what
[29:06] for just like you you and I are not
[29:10] gonna be we're not gonna throw this body
[29:12] away right and pick up a new one no work
[29:15] that would be real easy that'd be really
[29:19] easy but soccer party is this for Satan
[29:23] to see you do what you do walk the world
[29:25] in the world of Sam but God transform
[29:28] your body one day change our body you
[29:32] mean it'll be like his glorious body
[29:34] right it's a spirit of him that raised
[29:36] up Christ from the dead dwell in you he
[29:38] that raised up Christ from the dead
[29:39] shall also quicken oh I'm sorry didn't
[29:42] read ten and Christ me in you the body
[29:44] is dead because of sin but the Spirit is
[29:46] life because of righteousness
[29:48] see that's what we've got to understand
[29:50] even Paul was telling us that we are
[29:53] running just by what's inside of us not
[29:57] watching this thing you know Jesus ended
[30:00] this talk about the washing of the talks
[30:02] well what is this this is clay this is
[30:03] the pot you can sit and watch this thing
[30:07] every day still gonna die one day if we
[30:11] don't go think record I mean take a
[30:13] bunch of knee and cross beating you the
[30:16] body indeed is dead as to sin but the
[30:19] spirit of life as to righteousness verse
[30:22] 11 in the Greek and if the spirit of him
[30:25] who raised Jesus from the dead dwell in
[30:27] you he who raised Christ from the dead
[30:30] will also make alive your mortal bodies
[30:33] through the indwelling of his spirit
[30:36] within you I like that
[30:38] in this because the minute explains a
[30:41] little more of this but it's a spirit of
[30:43] him that raised up Christ from the dead
[30:44] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[30:47] from the dead shall also quicken your
[30:49] mortal body by his spirit that dwells in
[30:51] you
[30:52] therefore brother we are debtors not to
[30:55] the flesh to live after the flesh for we
[30:59] live after the flesh you shall die but
[31:03] if ye through the spin
[31:04] do mortify once mortgage my mortar more
[31:08] solidified bring something together it's
[31:12] my brother Brennan see it talks about
[31:13] the only spirit more during this
[31:14] together you know sealing it together
[31:17] let's read them let's read the original
[31:21] verses that so what if I didn't mean to
[31:26] kill do I come we're going left a minute
[31:32] we are going to do this right here
[31:34] I find it for God to kill literally okay
[31:44] metaphorically is made to die destroy
[31:46] render extinct by death to be liberated
[31:48] from the bond of anything bond of
[31:51] anything literally to be made dead in
[31:53] relation to something all right okay so
[31:56] if you mortify that does mean to die
[32:00] that's correct
[32:01] but you die well let's get back your
[32:04] hand you can't kill the deeds of the
[32:07] body totally because we're still living
[32:11] in flesh okay but we know that through
[32:14] the spirit that there are some things
[32:17] they have to die and then God seals
[32:19] because when you die they put you in a
[32:22] tenement in what seal you up that's why
[32:25] that your husband's got to be dead you
[32:28] can marry again because he ain't allowed
[32:31] he's dead he's sealed and that's the
[32:34] same way with when I'm clean spirit goes
[32:37] out of a man if you put Christ in there
[32:38] he can't come back and get in the same
[32:42] place he got anyone because there were
[32:43] things that he mortified because that's
[32:46] what I like said mortician and all those
[32:49] things come from what they deal with
[32:52] dead things right they mortify the deeds
[32:55] of the body you shall live for as many
[32:58] as are led by the Spirit of God they are
[33:00] the sons of God now this is where Paul
[33:03] has come to here in verse 13
[33:09] and he's telling us that we're debtors
[33:14] not to the flesh to live out so what is
[33:15] he doing he sees pulling everything
[33:17] apart for us all right
[33:19] but what he says about him whereas many
[33:21] others don't led by the Spirit of God
[33:22] they are the sons of God that's the
[33:23] whole summation of verse 1 through 13
[33:26] all the other things are you know things
[33:30] that happen but if you're led by the
[33:33] Spirit of God you're a son of God but
[33:37] for ye have not received the spirit of
[33:40] bondage now the spirit of bondage is the
[33:42] debtor and all these other things listen
[33:45] if I'm dead you can't put me in there if
[33:52] I'm dead you can't accuse me of being a
[33:54] thief
[33:56] right right you can't put me alive it if
[34:02] I'm dead I'm dead so if you not if you
[34:09] have for ye have not received the spirit
[34:11] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[34:14] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[34:16] we cry of my father our father father so
[34:22] here we've received the new birth first
[34:27] 1 through 13 the whole summation is
[34:29] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[34:31] walk not after the flesh but after the
[34:34] spirit for the lawless spirit of life in
[34:37] Christ has made us free from the law of
[34:39] sin and death and then Paul takes and
[34:41] tells us about it all the way down to
[34:43] verse 13 and then he sums the whole
[34:46] thing up in verse 14 for those there to
[34:49] live by the Spirit of God the other
[34:51] Sunday night and daughter's amen for ye
[34:54] have not received the spirit of bondage
[34:55] again to fear that's our problem see
[34:59] fear has moved from the inside man
[35:01] because there's no fear if you're born
[35:03] again that's what we don't understand
[35:04] there's no fear in the end
[35:06] man that's God himself he has no fear
[35:13] remember Adam was the one it was afraid
[35:16] that I was afraid guys never been afraid
[35:19] what's he been afraid of he made this
[35:21] place and he knows what's gonna happen
[35:24] in two seconds three seconds thirty you
[35:27] know I mean how steadily what it means
[35:30] you knew the exact well I don't know
[35:32] tomorrow if we knew what was gonna
[35:34] happen exactly tomorrow we brought my
[35:35] shooter itself no no but but God knows
[35:39] that though he has no fear because he's
[35:41] not in the human humanistic realm like
[35:43] we are right then he had no fear fair
[35:47] not so the soul has no fear so where's
[35:51] the fear I fear because I remember
[35:55] things memory you know what a reason
[36:01] that this wall is so thick I can't go
[36:03] through it but now if Jesus was here he
[36:06] did this step rattling in the building
[36:08] there prattling back out
[36:11] see Jesus Jesus did walk to the wall and
[36:14] hesitate no Ronal he just come right on
[36:22] through never bother him he never had to
[36:25] you know you see movies sometimes you
[36:26] know where they're dragging their self
[36:28] worried if they didn't go through as
[36:29] they're pulling herself through now he
[36:31] just want there's no fairy just Walters
[36:32] right Lois sustained movies like that
[36:35] I'm sure her movie is that yeah
[36:40] that's one of those Saturday afternoon
[36:42] matinee movies you know those things
[36:44] that I saw you at the other day any hell
[36:52] yeah
[36:52] how much do we have to be you have to
[36:54] business that again message Church you
[36:59] see that the old go kids is they'll
[37:05] start talking about something like Tom
[37:07] Cruise or something some way old Charlie
[37:09] and say message you see a message
[37:14] preacher yeah so it's funny we have a
[37:20] little fun Hill but look we have not
[37:22] received the spirit of bondage again to
[37:23] fear so your soul is not fear I mean
[37:25] anything what we got to do is let that
[37:26] man speak mm-hmm man that man can have
[37:28] control because our fear is I remember
[37:33] that wall solid and I can't walk through
[37:38] it well I just stopped myself right
[37:40] there because if I died at this very
[37:42] moment my soul didn't need a door to go
[37:45] outside horror or open the window my
[37:48] soul just goes into another dimension
[37:50] and it has to go through that wallet you
[37:53] know done that's what we have inside of
[37:56] it well so that's that's what the real
[38:00] you is and you you are going we are
[38:02] coming to the image bringing that man
[38:05] see probably say Oh wretched man that I
[38:08] am he said o wretched man that I am the
[38:10] middle guy he went on my soul being
[38:13] wretched My heavens no if you're born
[38:15] again there's no condemnation that's
[38:18] what we do we said condemn ourselves in
[38:19] our memory we the conscious affection
[38:21] imagination we do all that condemning
[38:23] when the souls in their crime what are
[38:27] you go mad what sin are you talking
[38:30] about that's why we see that the new
[38:33] birth though brings us a knowledge but
[38:38] it's never brought us a knowledge like
[38:40] today right I'll end up with this one
[38:42] we'll stop it because we're gonna start
[38:43] talking about adoption you receive the
[38:45] spirit of adoption when you're born
[38:47] again into the family
[38:48] you gotta be a son to be a okay you have
[38:53] to be a son or a daughter to be an error
[38:55] because he's fishing the talk without a
[38:56] man so we see we don't receive adoption
[39:00] we don't get the keys to the car the day
[39:03] we're born again no no we have tutors
[39:06] from trainers and we'll talk about that
[39:07] next Sunday we'll go into the Galatian
[39:09] just for a minute and read Galatians and
[39:11] then come back to the Romans but I
[39:13] really love and I preached on it many
[39:15] times both ls2 of romans 14 three down
[39:18] to the end because this is where we're
[39:21] going to come to the place - we're
[39:27] waiting for the adoption to wit our to
[39:31] witness our to understand the redemption
[39:34] of our body
[39:34] nobody's ever understood full redemption
[39:38] until today twelve we're coming out the
[39:40] seals on that fourth seal the rapture
[39:42] takes place so good in that fourth seal
[39:43] something's going to happen to you we
[39:45] got to come to a complete adoption we
[39:48] got to get the data on the ground we got
[39:49] to take a lot of change and then we
[39:50] going around so and we're in that time
[39:53] right now we'll stop right there but let
[39:58] that inside man to do the work you got
[40:01] to let him do the work we've been trying
[40:04] to figure things out ourselves too much
[40:05] tool
[40:07] he's really mentioning that
[40:10] [Music]
