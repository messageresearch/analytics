[4:36] Ward to be here in January we' already
[4:37] got that got that scheduled you know
[4:40] we're talking about the U no Messenger
[4:43] to the AG and I've been uh looking at
[4:45] some isza Street um people that have
[4:48] come out I know all of you know Smith
[4:51] Wigglesworth all right great powerful
[4:53] man of Faith he actually came from
[4:56] England over here to the isua street Rev
[5:00] to see what was going on so the isua
[5:03] Street Revival we've been talking about
[5:06] 1906 started the Holy Ghost fell on a
[5:10] group of people and that started the
[5:12] Pentecostal Revival that we should still
[5:15] be under now amen but I want to read to
[5:18] you what Smith Wiggles worth I read to
[5:20] you the other day what he said but
[5:21] listen to what his methods were now
[5:23] remember he's he's a great man of Faith
[5:26] uh he even told a man that had one leg
[5:28] he said go buy you par
[5:30] shoes it's in his book he said go buy a
[5:33] pair of shoes well he limps into the
[5:35] shoe store with one leg sits down tells
[5:37] the guy what size shoe he wants by the
[5:39] time the man got back that man's got two
[5:41] feet so that's God that's the power of
[5:45] the Holy Ghost even in Smith
[5:47] Wigglesworth wasn't even a prophet
[5:50] okay slow down a little bit listen to
[5:53] his methods often involved
[5:56] hitting
[5:58] slapping punch ing The Afflicted part of
[6:01] the body amen yall come up here for
[6:03] prayer for your
[6:05] head on a number of occasions his
[6:08] approach to persons suffering from
[6:11] stomach complaints was to punch them in
[6:14] the stomach sometimes with such force it
[6:17] propelled them across the
[6:20] room anybody got stomach trouble today
[6:23] okay see they're healed
[6:25] already when challenged on this his
[6:28] response was I don't hit them I hit the
[6:33] devil responding to criticism over his
[6:37] method woodsworth said you might think
[6:40] by the way I went about praying for the
[6:42] sick that I was that I'm unloving and
[6:45] rough but oh friends you have no idea
[6:49] what I see behind the
[6:52] sickness and the one who is
[6:55] Afflicted I am not dealing with the
[6:57] person I'm dealing with the satanic
[7:00] forces that are binding The Afflicted
[7:03] the only difference in Smith
[7:04] Wigglesworth being under Reformation my
[7:07] point is brother randam could stand and
[7:09] tell you where the disease was he didn't
[7:10] have to hit you in the stomach he knew
[7:12] where the dis disease was called it out
[7:14] discerned it knew it by another
[7:16] dimension where Smith Wigglesworth was
[7:18] just working if my stomach hurts I'm
[7:19] going to punch the devil out of
[7:21] it on one occasion Wigglesworth declared
[7:24] to the sick I'll only pray for you once
[7:28] to pray twice is
[7:30] unbelief the second night a man
[7:33] approached the altar to receive the
[7:34] prayer again and Wigglesworth recognized
[7:36] him and said boy it embarrass a lot of
[7:40] us didn't I pray for you last night you
[7:43] are full of unbelief get off my
[7:46] platform oh and we think we're
[7:50] rough but he had results I mean he got
[7:53] results be timid the devil will be all
[7:56] over us so let's bow our heads just for
[7:58] a moment dear heavenly father thank you
[7:59] for the day you've give us thank you for
[8:01] the time that you've set aside Lord for
[8:04] us to have service Lord you said we're
[8:06] two or three gathered together you'll be
[8:08] in their midst so Lord I believe there's
[8:11] more than two or three today that want
[8:12] to hear from you father so Lord as they
[8:15] pull on the gift Lord may they may they
[8:17] pull on you not not this human man that
[8:19] has many many faults and failures Lord
[8:21] but pull on the gift that's inside Lord
[8:23] I pray that You' touch each one Lord

[8:26] not here Mom different ones Lord sister
[8:30] um Johnny and Sister Mary and all the
[8:31] ones that we pray for on a daily basis

[8:36] hearts father and touch their bodies
[8:39] Lord I pray that you'd be with us in
[8:40] further in this
[8:41] service be brother Lise sometimes we

[9:10] who you are okay we went and dedicated
[9:12] his house yesterday so I told him I said
[9:15] so much Mexican food I'll be burping all
[9:17] day tomorrow so but it was good though
[9:20] oh it was good that was a good
[9:23] Feast so now we're on no we're still
[9:26] looking at no messenger the age I want
[9:28] to bring out something this afternoon
[9:29] and brother Ryan hit on it today that
[9:31] that sparked something else that we need
[9:33] to look at brother rhom said that the
[9:37] the Pentecostal Revival in 1906 was a
[9:40] restoration of the
[9:42] gifts now the greatest gift is is what
[9:45] brother Ryan read it's the love of God
[9:48] given to G given us Jesus Christ so that
[9:50] we can love him and he already loved us
[9:52] before the foundation of the world
[9:54] remember he Canan love you don't ever
[9:55] say God don't love me no more no he
[9:58] can't love you no less either if he ever
[10:00] loved you to the beginning he loves you
[10:02] now all right that's the devil talking
[10:05] to you but we have been promised the
[10:07] restoration of the gifts and I want to
[10:09] say to this church he promised us the
[10:11] restoration of the gifts because I'll
[10:13] read to you this afternoon where brother
[10:15] R said the gifts were given to the
[10:16] church to keep them clean to keep all
[10:19] the garbage out keep all the unbelief
[10:22] out keep all the things is you bring
[10:24] those non spiritual gifts in it don't
[10:25] have to always be speaking in
[10:27] tongues that's the lowest of the gifts
[10:30] the greatest gift is wisdom prayer Faith
[10:34] all those different things that we have
[10:35] in the church working that we do have
[10:37] the gifts working in the church but if
[10:39] we don't have speaking in tongues and
[10:40] interpretation everybody says well you
[10:42] don't have the gifts no no no there's
[10:44] nine of
[10:45] them and they're shown in different ways
[10:47] and we'll look at it this afternoon if
[10:48] you'll if you'll bear with me today
[10:50] we'll get to that so Joel 2:23 said be
[10:54] glad then ye children of Zion and
[10:55] rejoice in the Lord now remember this is
[10:57] the scripture that Peter read on the day
[10:59] of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell
[11:01] back there this is what he read all
[11:04] right be glad then ye children of John Z
[11:07] and rejoice in the Lord your God for he
[11:09] hath given you the former rain
[11:10] moderately and will cause to come down
[11:12] for you the rain the former rain and the
[11:14] latter rain in the first month now we'll
[11:16] get into the former and latter rain but
[11:18] remember what former rain what does a
[11:20] rain do a rain brings something up all
[11:23] right now the first rain which is the
[11:25] former rain is the teaching rain it's
[11:28] the planting of the seed you got to
[11:30] plant something for it to grow you can
[11:32] rain a flood I planted some food plot
[11:35] stuff yesterday and man it got some rain
[11:37] last night praise God for the rain amen
[11:40] and it'll come up because it's going to
[11:42] have rain on the seed that's been
[11:44] planted and then the lad rain or the
[11:45] Harvest rain should happen sometime in
[11:49] uh around
[11:50] November so that you everything will
[11:52] boom up to maturity and then you can
[11:54] Harvest it so that's the former rain
[11:56] brother Ram said the former rain is the
[11:57] teaching rain the latter rain is the
[11:59] Harvest rain so we need the former rain
[12:01] teaching because the latter rain is
[12:03] catching us out of here that's where you
[12:05] bind all the tears together that's where
[12:07] you bind all the wheat together wheat
[12:08] goes into Rapture tear stays here all
[12:11] right everybody with me on that so
[12:13] that's what the former and we'll get to
[12:14] that cuz brother Brenham he preached
[12:17] both but we are to manifest both cuz he
[12:22] had took a Rapture not yet right or the
[12:25] Harvest rain the Harvest rain has to
[12:27] come from somebody standing here
[12:29] somebody standing in this Dimension all
[12:31] right I'm got you standing too long I'm
[12:32] sorry and the floors shall be full of
[12:35] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[12:37] wine and oil and I will restore to you
[12:39] the years the Locust Eed the cankerworm
[12:41] caterpillar pommer worm my great Army
[12:44] which I sent among you which was what to
[12:46] eat the to eat the word down during the
[12:47] ages we'll talk about that a little bit
[12:49] this afternoon and ye shall eat in
[12:52] plenty who is Ye Ye my people God's
[12:54] people he's talking about Israel but we
[12:56] are the people of God all right and
[12:58] praise the name name of the Lord your
[12:59] God that hath dwelt wondrously with you
[13:02] and my people shall never be ashamed and
[13:05] you shall know that I am in the midst of
[13:06] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[13:07] and none else and my people shall never
[13:10] be
[13:10] ashamed Are you ashamed to be a
[13:12] Christian today no I am not I am not
[13:15] ashamed to be a Christian and if you
[13:17] stand for him now he'll stand for you
[13:19] then it shall come to pass afterward
[13:22] look after that that I'll pour out my
[13:24] spirit upon All
[13:26] Flesh everybody with me on that now
[13:28] listen listen the way it's written is
[13:30] the way it means anybody can receive the
[13:33] Holy Ghost now they couldn't in the Old
[13:36] Testament that's right they couldn't
[13:38] when Jesus was here amen it was barred
[13:42] it was under bulls and goats it was a
[13:44] substitute but when the fullness of time
[13:47] come when Jesus died and come back he
[13:49] said I'm coming back to get inside of
[13:51] you and I'm going to pour out my spirit
[13:53] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[13:55] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[13:57] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[13:59] see visions and also upon the servants
[14:02] and upon the handmaid so it doesn't
[14:03] matter who you
[14:04] are if you want the Holy Ghost today
[14:07] he's getting ready to pour it in you all
[14:09] right and upon the handmaid in those
[14:11] days will I pour out my spirit you may
[14:13] be seated Lord has his Blessing to the
[14:15] reading of the word I thought that was
[14:17] pretty powerful about Smith Wigglesworth
[14:19] and also even brother Brown talks about
[14:21] FF Bosworth FF Bosworth was there on the
[14:25] zuda street thank
[14:27] you then you another
[14:37] one one of must not be working one's not
[14:40] working it's okay okay all right all
[14:44] right Acts 2 verse1 says when the day of
[14:46] Pentecost was fully come now we know
[14:48] what Pentecost is it's 50 the Holy Ghost
[14:50] fell on 50 days after the death of Jesus
[14:54] okay after the Passover and suddenly
[14:57] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[14:59] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[15:01] the house that they were sitting and
[15:03] there appeared unto them clothing
[15:08] tongues like fire all right we'll get
[15:10] into that maybe this afternoon and it
[15:12] sat upon each of them and they were all
[15:15] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[15:16] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[15:18] gave them utterance so the gifts were
[15:21] not just restored in the first church
[15:23] age in the first Pentecostal age they
[15:26] were
[15:27] developed cuz you hardly anybody speak
[15:29] in tongues that said maybe prophets or
[15:31] maybe somebody uh uh Caiaphas he
[15:35] prophesied but this is an overall this
[15:37] is an outpouring on ad30 was on
[15:43] 120 and on
[15:46] 3,000 now in 1906 it went from a few to
[15:51] Millions I think they calculated 600
[15:54] million people came out of that 1906 so
[15:57] he poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[15:59] that was God's promise he's going to
[16:00] give it to everybody amen that wants it
[16:02] that's right it wasn't just for a select
[16:04] few but there was just a select few back
[16:07] then because remember you and I are
[16:09] under the age of um uh rapid
[16:14] intelligence and also rapid
[16:17] information if you want information
[16:19] today punch a button all you got to do
[16:22] Google it ask
[16:24] Siri right they didn't have that they
[16:27] had to physically take the word
[16:29] they didn't even have a Bible they had
[16:32] to take the word in their
[16:33] heart that's why I understand from
[16:36] reading back in the history and when we
[16:38] were coming through there with
[16:39] Constantine and the different
[16:40] ones that's why it got all scrupled
[16:44] up man could say this over here and he
[16:46] started Doctrine and there'd be no way
[16:48] to know it until it came around to
[16:49] somebody else so there's where you got
[16:51] your divisions from there was nothing to
[16:53] fight it with well today we have
[16:55] something to fight it with today false
[16:57] Doctrine needs to be taken care of amen
[17:01] and we have a we have something to take
[17:03] care of it with amen the word of God all
[17:07] of it and then the Amplified version of
[17:10] 1160 sermons that brother Brandon
[17:12] preached all right I just believe that
[17:14] he's a Divine revealer of the word of
[17:16] God that's what brother brandom is not
[17:19] was he's still alive if y'all don't mind
[17:21] me saying that he's not in this
[17:23] Dimension but he's more alive now than
[17:25] he was then right so we started with a
[17:28] pentec Al Revival over there on right at
[17:30] the beginning right before Paul comes on
[17:32] the scene there was a Pentecostal
[17:34] Revival Paul was not in it we'll read it
[17:37] in a minute we read it Wednesday night
[17:38] Paul's not in it or whatever the last
[17:41] night pre what time I preached
[17:43] Pentecostal
[17:44] Revival over there in the beginning Paul
[17:46] was not a part of that Paul was a church
[17:48] age Messenger to Ephesus all right but
[17:50] there had to be a Pentecostal age
[17:52] because remember God's in a lap over so
[17:54] they lap from the Old Testament to the
[17:57] New Testament right that's why you had
[17:59] to have John the Baptist to be there to
[18:02] transition the hearts of the fathers to
[18:04] the Pentecostal babies or the ones on uh
[18:07] 1906 not 1906 but 8030 but then you look
[18:11] over here if we're if that's the alphab
[18:14] bride and it began out of a
[18:16] Pentecost all right then we're the Omega
[18:19] bride we're the Omega bride here Alphas
[18:23] over there they started with the
[18:24] Pentecost then we had to have a
[18:26] Pentecost right here
[18:30] right and think of it brother bradam
[18:33] couldn't have come out of a Methodist
[18:37] Revival he had to wait till the
[18:39] restoration of the gift so that people
[18:41] would know that there was gifts to get
[18:44] now listen John Wesley I'm sorry I'm
[18:47] going I'm speaking slow they're telling
[18:48] me to slow down okay thank you
[18:51] Regina I couldn't see Christina in the
[18:54] back so Regina's doing it now just slow
[18:57] down yeah slow down
[19:01] I don't want I don't I don't want
[19:03] brother Louise to
[19:05] um to uh miss anything I I'm sorry so
[19:10] just bear with me not that I'm trying to
[19:11] think I'm trying to stop for a second
[19:13] okay so on the day of Pentecost the Holy
[19:15] Ghost fell now we'll look at it in a
[19:18] minute the Holy Ghost fell on that day
[19:21] of Pentecost on two different groups of
[19:25] people all right two different groups of
[19:27] people we get to that in a minute now
[19:30] what happened though in 1906 it fell on
[19:32] one group of people is everybody with me
[19:36] but they were
[19:38] babies they didn't know how to use the
[19:40] gifts amen they didn't know how to use
[19:43] them brother Brown told them Pentecostal
[19:45] babies all right so we'll get to that
[19:48] but remember they matured they matured
[19:50] because how did the how did the ones at
[19:52] 3,000 in ad30 how'd they mature God sent
[19:56] a prophet Paul
[19:58] all right then in the end time you had
[20:01] Pentecost it was true the baptism of the
[20:03] Holy Ghost was their
[20:07] leader all right param was the spokesman
[20:11] and and Seymour was the spokesman but
[20:13] the Holy Ghost fell himself to bring the
[20:14] gifts back right then God sent a prophet
[20:19] to straighten everything else out just
[20:21] like he did over here cuz remember in
[20:23] Peter's age and all those different ones
[20:25] you still had people back in in in u the
[20:27] Old Testament
[20:29] come on until
[20:31] ad70 they were still having sacrifices
[20:34] in Jerusalem in the temple because the
[20:37] temple was still there right but in 8070
[20:40] Titus destroyed it took the temple away
[20:42] and that's why they're building it back
[20:45] now the Jews have to have a temple to
[20:47] worship
[20:49] God sir but God has a temple now to
[20:54] Worship in to worship with and in and
[20:57] through that by way with me on that all
[20:59] right that's why he said I'll pour out
[21:02] my spirit not on all
[21:04] buildings he said I'll pour out all
[21:06] flesh that's why you're going to have we
[21:09] we won't get to it today but next week
[21:11] or the week after you got anointed
[21:14] ones they're Anointed with that same
[21:16] true holy ghost that fell on the day of
[21:19] Pentecost it just falls on their Spirit
[21:21] realm don't go down into their soul it
[21:24] just anoints them yes sir which can come
[21:28] off
[21:29] and come on and come off and come on but
[21:33] remember on the day of Pentecost that
[21:35] Pillar of Fire didn't come off those
[21:37] people it went in those people and when
[21:39] you receive the Holy Ghost now it
[21:41] doesn't just come on you it goes inside
[21:43] of you and it burns there's fire there
[21:46] that burns all that out we'll get to
[21:48] that in just a little bit so what does
[21:51] God promise that we have a covenant that
[21:53] used to be back over there the the
[21:56] fathers in the Old Testament
[21:59] they were the old Prophets The Isaiah
[22:02] and all the different ones what did they
[22:03] do though they prophesied of a Time
[22:06] coming all right now also remember
[22:09] brother brandham was a prophet too he
[22:11] prophesied of a Time
[22:13] coming he was working in the astronaut
[22:16] age but he didn't see all the astronauts
[22:19] right this is the astronauts right
[22:22] here most of you weren't even born when
[22:25] he died in
[22:27] 1965 right right so you are though you
[22:30] were that thought he was prophesying of
[22:34] if he saw a vision of the Bride he saw
[22:35] you if your
[22:37] bride all right everybody with me that's
[22:40] why we're current modern day
[22:43] Believers were not like theusa Street
[22:47] they had flaws I said they the Holy
[22:50] Ghost don't have flaws but they had
[22:53] flaws and they continued to have flaws
[22:55] all the way through even in early
[22:57] Pentecost when brother bam come on the
[22:58] scene in the'
[23:00] 40s they would stand up and start
[23:02] speaking in tongues they start shouting
[23:05] right in the middle of a service you've
[23:06] seen you've read it and brother R didn't
[23:07] say anything until after a while why
[23:09] they were Pentecostal babies right but
[23:12] he knew that it was a real Holy Ghost
[23:13] fell on
[23:15] them remember those two guys that he
[23:17] went to visit one of them got up and
[23:19] spoke in tongues and the other got up
[23:20] and and
[23:22] prophesied and it was
[23:25] right but he said I discern that one man
[23:27] was true and that other man was living
[23:29] with another woman right that's I'll
[23:32] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh you
[23:34] can get caught up in emotion and forget
[23:37] about the word of
[23:39] God but you can't have the word of God
[23:42] without having some kind of
[23:44] emotion cuz it stimulates
[23:47] you cuz remember if it fell on them and
[23:50] they shouted in spoking tongues in 1906
[23:52] they caught it and started speaking in
[23:55] tongues I'm not saying speaking in
[23:57] tongues you know that we've been taught
[24:02] different but we'll talk about this
[24:06] afternoon if it's a gift from God it's
[24:08] something you need to
[24:10] use cuz that's a gift from God if I give
[24:12] you a gift I give brother Donnie um I'm
[24:15] GNA give brother Donnie a an oil lamp or
[24:18] something that he a don't even have any
[24:19] I mean he'll just set up here and draw
[24:23] um dust I wasn't going to say that Sue
[24:26] sitting there but set up here and draw
[24:29] dust why cuz it's not for it's a gift I
[24:31] give him but it's not pertinent to what
[24:32] he was now if I give him a gun like he's
[24:35] given me a few they're put up in the
[24:37] safe and they're safekeeping that was a
[24:39] gift now if God gives you a gift it's
[24:43] perfect The Giver is perfect the gift is
[24:46] perfect it's how you use
[24:48] it amen you can use it right or you can
[24:51] just quench the spirit and never use it
[24:53] at all but we all will give an account
[24:55] for that for there was a tabernacle made
[24:57] the first R was the Candlestick the
[24:59] table the shoe bread remember that's
[25:03] sanctification and after the second Veil
[25:06] when you go into the second Veil The
[25:08] Tabernacle which is called the holy of
[25:10] holies so now what is the outside with
[25:13] the Candlestick the table to shoe bread
[25:15] that is your spirit
[25:18] realm everybody with me remember we were
[25:20] a three
[25:22] room and we have a body spirit and a
[25:24] soul your body outter Court your spirit
[25:28] spirit in courtt but the soul is the
[25:30] holy of holies that's where God is or is
[25:33] not amen they're not both in there at
[25:35] the same
[25:38] time right either you're born again
[25:41] today or you're not there's no in
[25:43] between now there's a journey there's a
[25:45] journey to that just keep going keep
[25:49] believing keep having faith be a
[25:52] believer believe in what God's already
[25:54] said he said he'd give you the Holy
[25:56] Ghost
[25:59] which had the golden sensor and the Ark
[26:01] of the Covenant overlaid with gold there
[26:04] was Mana there that God created and
[26:07] Aaron's Rod that budded which God
[26:09] created The Buds and the
[26:11] almonds and then God wrote the two
[26:13] tables that went into the are so that's
[26:15] a God thing when you go into
[26:16] there second realm man when you get all
[26:19] these emotions memory reason conscious
[26:21] effect and Imagination and all that goes
[26:23] to rolling around in our head God is not
[26:25] in
[26:26] that hello
[26:30] yes unless it's pertinent to what's in
[26:33] the deep inside of you when that deep
[26:35] inside of you comes out it's if it's God
[26:38] it's got to be God if it's the devil
[26:39] it's got to be the devil it can't be two
[26:41] it can't be both how can you take the
[26:43] Bible says a good thing out of an evil
[26:45] thing how can you get good water out of
[26:47] a bad well can't do it
[26:52] am so now
[26:55] listen to get started here the 83d 30
[26:58] I'm going to refer to them as ad30 holy
[27:01] ghost that was the 120 in the upper room
[27:04] that Jesus had been with for 3 and a
[27:06] half years they were with him on almost
[27:08] every service they were with him he told
[27:11] them
[27:14] things but it started in Isaiah 53 as a
[27:18] promise he shall see the travail of
[27:21] that's he's talking about he God the
[27:23] travail of Jesus's Soul which is the
[27:24] same person shall be satisfied by his
[27:27] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[27:30] justify many those who is Justified he's
[27:33] what he's already glorified all right so
[27:37] he had to start with justification for
[27:39] he shall bear their iniquities what we
[27:41] were talking about in justification you
[27:43] can't justify
[27:44] yourself there's no way you can justify
[27:48] yourself but I that's justifying
[27:51] yourself no I like what Louise says but
[27:54] God but God said see Let God
[27:59] justifies if he's the justifier if he's
[28:01] just and the justifier and he's the
[28:04] judge and he's the
[28:05] jury we got no problem I wish it was
[28:09] that simple but we do have problems cuz
[28:11] we get in the way but
[28:13] I so now Romans
[28:16] 3:30 Paul tells the sin is one God which
[28:19] shall what which shall justify the
[28:21] circumcision by faith all right he's
[28:24] talking about the Jews and the
[28:25] uncircumcision which is the Gentiles
[28:27] through faith so so you got to go
[28:28] through something he knew the Gentiles
[28:30] would have to go through something he
[28:33] had to what put away the he he put away
[28:35] the um Israel to get the Gentile Church
[28:39] the
[28:40] uncircumcised do we then make void the
[28:42] law through faith God forbid you can't
[28:45] do away with the
[28:50] law God forbid yay we establish the law
[28:54] and as somebody said here not too long
[28:56] ago if you got the Holy Ghost you only
[28:58] one that can live the law you can live
[29:01] that law to the
[29:03] letter
[29:06] amen cuz why would he write it if we
[29:08] couldn't live it he knew they couldn't
[29:10] live it but he had to give them
[29:12] something to guide them through so that
[29:15] there could be a judge or a judgment in
[29:17] the Old Testament until the righteous
[29:19] judge came and died for us and Justified
[29:22] all of us if you'll accept
[29:25] it okay kind of simple Faith but that's
[29:29] the way it starts then Jesus in John 17
[29:32] he's talking to the father he says
[29:34] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[29:36] is true so how are we going to be
[29:37] Sanctified as brother Ryan says if we
[29:39] don't read our
[29:41] Bible That's What sanctifies us the
[29:43] washing of the water of the word all
[29:46] right that our five-fold ministry that
[29:48] tells you what the Bible says right all
[29:50] right don't change it tell you what it
[29:53] says and when you do and you conform to
[29:56] that then that sanctify
[29:58] remember sanctification is a process how
[30:01] do you eat an
[30:03] elephant one body at a
[30:06] time as thou has sent me into the world
[30:09] now watch see he's going to equip us
[30:11] because he's going to send us into the
[30:15] world he's not going to put us out here
[30:17] and make us powerless no as thou H has
[30:21] sent me into the world even so have I
[30:24] sent them into the world so he had to
[30:27] give them something to to work with
[30:29] listen he was the justifier he was the
[30:32] sanctifier and he had the Holy Ghost
[30:34] Inside of him when he was walking on
[30:36] Earth as human as a human being Jesus
[30:39] Christ the son of
[30:43] man you say I can't do it he promised
[30:46] you he'd help you do it if you let him
[30:48] do it
[30:51] am even for their sake I sanctify myself
[30:56] he set himself upon heart just for me
[30:58] and you he could have had a wife brother
[31:01] Brown said hello he could have had all
[31:04] these things but he he he sacrificed all
[31:07] that to show you a Sanctified life a
[31:10] Nazarite vow that he took that we as a
[31:13] Christians should take that same
[31:14] Nazarite vow just as he did right Amen
[31:18] to stay
[31:19] clean but sometimes we don't stay
[31:24] clean we let the human part get involved
[31:27] that's why we're going to talk to see
[31:28] this afternoon that's why God give gifts
[31:30] to the church one thing and one thing
[31:33] only is to keep the church
[31:35] clean that's
[31:36] it now there's exhortation and there's
[31:39] all these but most of the gifts are
[31:41] given to keep the church clean amen and
[31:44] then brother Brown said that's why Jesus
[31:45] is not here I'll read it this afternoon
[31:48] is because he hasn't come back because
[31:49] church is not
[31:51] ready but oh my we get upset trying to
[31:55] get ready but we going to get ready
[31:58] God going to have a church without spot
[31:59] a wrinkle I promise you that I'm not
[32:01] going to promise you that I say that's
[32:03] thus sayth the Lord because it's come
[32:04] out of the Bible without spot or
[32:07] wrinkle for their sake I sanctify
[32:12] myself that they also might be
[32:15] Sanctified
[32:17] through the
[32:18] truth that's why brother brandham had to
[32:21] restore everything back to the truth
[32:24] first then the gifts come right and the
[32:27] gift that that he had was perfect yes
[32:31] because it was the Holy Ghost himself
[32:32] the person of Jesus Christ standing
[32:34] inside of brother brandham telling those
[32:36] people what their problem was never
[32:38] failed one
[32:41] time neither pray I for these alone
[32:43] watch
[32:45] this but for them also which Shall
[32:47] Believe on me through the words of the
[32:50] people that I
[32:56] sanctify for them all also which Shall
[32:58] Believe that's us that's right on me
[33:01] through their word Apostles prophets
[33:03] pastors teachers and evangelist and you
[33:05] reading the word of God and you
[33:06] listening to tapes and you reading
[33:09] books John 20:
[33:11] 211 then Jesus said to them peace be
[33:14] unto you as my father has sent me even
[33:16] so send I you now remember up here we we
[33:19] talk about Jesus has
[33:21] Justified he Sanctified them through thy
[33:23] truth so we went through justification
[33:25] and sanctification that's what the the
[33:27] apost Les in ad30 they they're under
[33:29] that Ministry we come down to the to the
[33:32] end of his ministry though and he's
[33:33] getting ready to leave he's getting
[33:34] ready to walk off the earth and go into
[33:36] another dimension Jesus say watch as my
[33:38] father has sent me so send I you and
[33:41] when he had said this he breathed on
[33:43] them and saith unto them receive ye the
[33:46] Holy Ghost now remember they did not
[33:48] receive it then
[33:51] right cuz it was all wound up in
[33:54] Jesus hello I'll read you I got a quote
[33:57] for it okay
[33:58] okay that's what brother R said when I
[34:01] believe it too because he had to go away
[34:04] he was he was in that body I thinking
[34:07] the other day U Brother Gary he was in a
[34:10] Jesus was trapped God was trapped in a
[34:11] body
[34:12] cast called flesh that's what he was
[34:15] trapped in he couldn't get out unless he
[34:19] died so that body cast that was holding
[34:22] all that together had to die to release
[34:24] the life well right here he's getting
[34:26] ready to release it cuz he's coming back
[34:27] on the day of Pentecost right and give
[34:30] them the holy ghost that was inside of
[34:32] him then he could be in multiple places
[34:35] at one time amen me you and everybody
[34:38] else right and when he had said this he
[34:40] breathed on them and saith unto them
[34:43] receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever
[34:46] sends you remit look how powerful this
[34:49] message
[34:50] is whosoever sins you remit amen they're
[34:56] remitted and whosoever sends you retain
[34:59] they are retained I like this in the
[35:02] Greek Lexicon that word breathe or
[35:04] breathed on them it's only used two
[35:06] times in the
[35:08] Bible for that
[35:11] definition to blow or breathe upon where
[35:14] Jesus after the manner of the Hebrew
[35:15] prophets
[35:17] expressed by the symbolic Act of
[35:19] breathing upon the apostles now see the
[35:22] symbolic act they even know it was a
[35:23] symbolic act okay the apostles the
[35:26] communication of the power of the Holy
[35:28] Spirit to them this word used only once
[35:32] by the whatever that is 20s something
[35:34] translate translators in Genesis 2:7
[35:37] where God breathed on
[35:38] Adam right and he became a living Soul
[35:42] amen just as the original creation was
[35:45] completed by an act of God so to the new
[35:48] creation was completed by an act from
[35:51] the head of the new creation and if
[35:54] y'all been around here long enough
[35:56] brother Dale preached many many sermons
[35:57] on born by the Breath of God that's what
[36:01] we are born when you're born again
[36:02] you're born by the Breath of God not the
[36:05] breath of the devil the death breath of
[36:07] your mama and daddy born by the breath
[36:08] of almighty God so they were what Adam
[36:11] was
[36:13] too he started the
[36:16] generation and now he's going to end the
[36:18] Generation by putting that same breath
[36:21] inside of a group of people amen and
[36:24] then what do we do we breathe it back
[36:26] out
[36:28] we can say to people brother Dale can
[36:31] say many many times receive ye the Holy
[36:33] Ghost brother dick brother alen all the
[36:35] different ones that came in under his
[36:37] ministry they heard the word of God
[36:39] brother collie brother Dy different ones
[36:42] they heard the word of God they were
[36:44] born by the Breath of God not the breath
[36:45] of Samuel Dale but by the Breath of
[36:48] God Amen that's right but it had to come
[36:51] through the
[36:52] body it had to come through the body you
[36:55] can't just hear the wind blow that's
[36:57] right amen
[37:00] right you got to hear it from
[37:03] somebody and that's the way God set it
[37:05] up because the gift he gave us the
[37:07] greatest five gifts he gave us was
[37:09] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[37:11] evangelists that's the greatest gift he
[37:13] ever give us CU that's the only one now
[37:15] either all those gifts the N spiritual
[37:18] gift tells you that it'll help you and
[37:21] it'll do all these things for you right
[37:23] right but the Bible says in Ephesians
[37:25] that he gave you those five spiritual
[37:27] gifts to perfect
[37:29] you they didn't get perfected by the
[37:31] gifts back in in Pentecost you get
[37:34] perfected by the word of God through a
[37:36] five-fold Ministry it's the only way
[37:38] you're going to get
[37:40] perfected dear brother Brandon what's
[37:42] the difference when Jesus breathed on
[37:44] the disciples and said receive ye the
[37:45] Holy Ghost and when they had to go to
[37:47] the upper room to tarry it was a promise
[37:51] he gave them breathed upon them his
[37:53] promise and said receive ye the Holy
[37:54] Ghost it was a promise
[37:57] but they had to go to the upper room to
[37:59] wait for the promise to be
[38:02] fulfilled the same thing is when we lay
[38:04] hands upon you to be healed then you go
[38:06] on about your business waiting for the
[38:09] promise to be fulfilled that's right if
[38:12] we have time this afternoon there's
[38:14] there there's Divine Healing and there's
[38:16] miracle healing right Divine Healing is
[38:19] a
[38:20] process right instant healing is
[38:22] something fall off or you instantly your
[38:24] back foit hurting or or whatever but
[38:27] sometimes healing takes
[38:30] time that's what the Bible says and
[38:32] that's what brother Brown
[38:34] said Remember the Two
[38:36] Sisters remember they didn't get
[38:38] anything on the prayer line but a week
[38:40] later or after the meeting right they
[38:43] lived in the same community and one just
[38:46] jumped up and whatever it was they were
[38:48] healed and she run to the other one and
[38:49] the other one was screaming running
[38:51] around the kitchen you know what brother
[38:53] Brown said
[38:55] right he said the healing Angel went
[38:58] through their community that
[39:00] day what a mighty God we serve the
[39:03] healing act they didn't they weren
[39:05] praying in the closet and doing all
[39:06] their no they were going about their
[39:08] Duty right he he said the healing Angel
[39:11] remembered that promise and just went
[39:13] right through and healed them both of
[39:15] them in the same Community what a mighty
[39:17] God we
[39:21] serve so now the upper room Jesus tells
[39:24] them in Luke 24 before he leaves he said
[39:27] behold I send the promise of my father
[39:29] upon you but T ye in the city of
[39:31] Jerusalem until you be endued or what or
[39:34] be sunk into with power from on high so
[39:38] when that day of Pentecost come that
[39:40] became a
[39:42] reality it came a sound of Heaven from
[39:44] Heaven A rushing Mighty Wind filled all
[39:46] the house and there appeared clothing
[39:48] tongues like as of fire and it set upon
[39:51] each one and you remember what happened
[39:53] but now
[39:55] remember that was one group of people
[39:58] people that was 120 that had been
[40:01] tutored by all that I just read you they
[40:04] heard that for three and A2 years every
[40:05] day day in and day out they put their
[40:08] faith that Jesus Justified them
[40:11] Sanctified them and when they come to
[40:13] the day of Pentecost
[40:15] boom Jo uh Peter stands up and says what
[40:18] this is that that I read you and Joel I
[40:23] read you the same thing Peter read you
[40:25] 2,000 years ago right
[40:28] and what did it do it pricked 3,000
[40:31] people's heart amen 3,000 people heard
[40:35] that sermon and the word from the Old
[40:39] Testament was quickened to a group of
[40:42] people standing in the brand new
[40:45] testament cuz remember the Testament is
[40:47] not enforced till the testator's dead so
[40:49] God had Jesus had to die God can't died
[40:51] Jesus died
[40:54] amen so there had to be a new testament
[40:56] that's why we're at today we're going to
[40:57] take communion he's going to say this is
[41:00] what the New Testament in my blood this
[41:02] is something
[41:03] new but it's a testament that I'm going
[41:06] to come back and I'm going to dwell with
[41:08] you and you take this in remembrance of
[41:11] me so if you don't take it then you must
[41:13] have a remembrance of something
[41:16] else I'm
[41:18] sorry you must have a remembrance of
[41:20] something
[41:21] else because to take communion is to
[41:23] remember what Christ did for us and if
[41:26] he hasn't done that for you you got time
[41:29] repent come to the Lord take
[41:35] communion but now remember there was
[41:38] other people dwelling in Jerusalem
[41:40] devout men of every nation remember it
[41:42] was the day of Pentecost pente cost is a
[41:45] big feast and everybody from all nations
[41:47] came in thank God the Holy Ghost fell
[41:50] because it fell on 120 and then they
[41:53] preached to 3,000 and then they went out
[41:55] into their countries and took took the
[41:57] Holy Ghost with them instead of having
[41:59] to send the Holy Ghost to these and that
[42:00] and the other all the ones that we read
[42:02] here they're just uh you know several
[42:05] nations were there and God then through
[42:09] Peter freshly anointed by the Holy Ghost
[42:12] freshly received by the quickening power
[42:15] of the Holy Ghost Peter all those words
[42:17] were quickened to Peter that Jesus
[42:20] said come on brother Brown said the Holy
[42:23] Ghost fell on
[42:24] Sons in that Upper Room they become
[42:27] mature really really
[42:30] quick how could Peter tell us to do this
[42:33] right here if he had already made
[42:35] it
[42:37] hello you can't teach somebody something
[42:39] you don't know anything
[42:45] about and they were all amazed it was
[42:48] noised abroad and this thing just went
[42:49] out a minute some were confounded cuz
[42:52] they heard their they heard their native
[42:54] tongue spoken by somebody that wasn't
[42:56] part of their community are part of
[42:58] their
[42:59] Nation they be like me speaking today
[43:02] and brother Lis didn't have to interpret
[43:04] they're hearing me in
[43:06] Spanish you're hearing me in English
[43:08] because you're part of my you know my
[43:10] culture my my
[43:12] ethnicity but they were heing there see
[43:15] so it's not the
[43:18] speaking it's the
[43:20] hearing Faith doesn't come by
[43:22] speaking faith comes by
[43:25] hearing amen that created such a
[43:29] faith in those people so they said there
[43:33] was a group over here that didn't
[43:34] believe it though they said oh they're
[43:35] just drunk well yeah they were they were
[43:38] drunk on the Holy Ghost amen that ain't
[43:41] bad to be that way amen but then there's
[43:44] a group over here that
[43:46] says man that does something to my heart
[43:51] the Bible said it pricked their heart
[43:52] right in other words you feel a
[43:56] little how many of us have felt that
[43:58] though in a meeting though where the
[43:59] Holy Ghost was inside of you already but
[44:01] yet you heard false
[44:02] Doctrine all many times I'm sorry to say
[44:07] but many times you hear somebody say
[44:08] something and you go there's some there
[44:10] some little something that that pinches
[44:13] at your heart it says something's not
[44:14] right about that and even in situations
[44:17] in your life if you've not been through
[44:18] situations in your life where something
[44:20] says don't go down that road don't don't
[44:23] do that go this way or or don't say this
[44:27] say that amen see there's people
[44:30] children that are led by the spirit of
[44:32] God they're the Sons and Daughters of
[44:34] God you say have nothing you're a
[44:38] Powerhouse you all are a Powerhouse if
[44:40] you got the Holy Ghost you got more
[44:42] power in you than you ever will
[44:45] know you can create a
[44:47] world and go live on it hallu but I want
[44:51] to live by
[44:53] myself I'll tell you one thing if you're
[44:55] on an island by yourself you you put
[44:57] yourself
[45:01] there so anyway how and how hear we
[45:06] every man that was the whole question it
[45:08] wasn't the tongue speaking it was the
[45:10] hearing how is this miracle happening
[45:14] Hallelujah that I'm hearing I'm watching
[45:17] his mouth move in English but I'm
[45:20] hearing him in
[45:22] Spanish but Peter now watch standing up
[45:25] with the 11 remember Peter was the
[45:28] spokesperson all right he spoke on the
[45:30] day of
[45:31] Pentecost but remember he wasn't a
[45:34] Prophet come on he wasn't a prophet cuz
[45:37] he even said in his own writings he said
[45:39] Paul says things hard to be understood
[45:40] so Paul was like here being a church age
[45:43] messenger Having the Holy Ghost being a
[45:45] prophet he was the Divine reveal of the
[45:47] word Peter was not but Peter knew his
[45:51] position amen Peter didn't say bless God
[45:53] Paul I don't agree with nothing you said
[45:55] no when Peter and Paul met each other
[45:57] they had the same
[45:59] Doctrine but Peter standing up with the
[46:02] 11 I hope that happens two weeks from
[46:05] yesterday well we going to have about 30
[46:07] preachers in this
[46:09] building praise the
[46:12] Lord but Peter standing up with the 11
[46:14] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[46:16] ye men of Judea and all that dwell in
[46:18] Jerusalem be it known unto you and
[46:19] hearken to my words these are not
[46:21] drunken men as you suppose see it's just
[46:23] the third hour of the day which was 9:00
[46:25] in the morning I believe it was but but
[46:27] this is that which was spoken by Joel he
[46:29] took it right straight to
[46:31] scripture and whether they understood
[46:33] that scripture or not they knew there
[46:35] was something going on and it shall come
[46:38] to pass in the last days I will pour out
[46:39] my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and
[46:42] daughters your prophesy I read this just
[46:43] a little while
[46:46] ago and it shall come to pass that
[46:49] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[46:50] Lord shall be
[46:52] saved and when he got finished preaching
[46:54] that sermon they said men and Bre
[46:58] what can we do to receive what you just
[47:01] got man when somebody receiv receives
[47:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that ought
[47:05] to just I mean it ought to just you just
[47:07] become one again you become one right it
[47:10] ought to be that right so you wonder
[47:13] whether it's it's the holy ghost or not
[47:15] I mean there are ghost this one's holy
[47:19] hello
[47:20] somebody the devil's a spirit too you
[47:23] know he a spiritual being
[47:27] so now look there was no Messenger to
[47:28] the first outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[47:30] so there's not going to be a messenger
[47:31] to the second outpouring of the Holy
[47:32] Ghost param and William Seymour were the
[47:36] spokesperson they stood up and said this
[47:38] is
[47:39] that this is what we've been waiting for
[47:43] this is it the Holy Ghost fell on those
[47:45] two people and then it started a
[47:50] Revival but remember just as the Revival
[47:54] started in ad30 there was still still a
[47:57] bunch of people that were in the Old
[47:58] Testament because remember the big the
[48:01] the thing that Peter and and Paul had a
[48:04] problem with it wasn't
[48:05] Doctrine but Peter was taking the
[48:09] circumcised were of God we've been
[48:13] circumcised all you over there you ain't
[48:16] been circumcised you go sit over there
[48:19] now Paul rebuked him and said there it's
[48:22] not circumcision or uncircumcision
[48:23] anymore it's uncircumcision of the heart
[48:27] amen you quit shunning them people quit
[48:29] shunning them Gentiles that's my people
[48:32] too because he was a prophet he was a
[48:35] what he want a
[48:37] reformer so now we got the spokesman now
[48:40] which is
[48:41] seeyour we have seen more in in param so
[48:45] the same patterns in this age no
[48:47] messenger but brother Ram come as a
[48:49] prophet on the scene as a Divine
[48:51] revealer not of the
[48:53] gifts he didn't reveal the gifts the
[48:56] gifts were already
[48:57] revealed he revealed how to use them and
[49:01] tie up all the Loose Ends listen we got
[49:03] a message that's
[49:05] perfect man's the one that's messed it
[49:07] up but this message is
[49:10] perfect cuz it didn't come from
[49:13] God it was
[49:15] God it was God speaking the voice of God
[49:18] for the end time was the voice of
[49:22] God sorry sorry Louise you supposed to
[49:25] say a SL down
[49:28] okay I just enjoy doing this I'm sorry I
[49:32] do so brother R said look justification
[49:34] is a work of the Holy Spirit
[49:36] sanctification is a work now remember
[49:39] justification in Martin Luther's day was
[49:41] the Holy Ghost for that day
[49:43] right God was pleased but God moved
[49:46] on so justification now won't get you in
[49:49] the body of Christ it'll get you cleaned
[49:51] up
[49:55] yes when you put your hand down I'll
[49:58] talk
[50:03] she's sanctification is a work of the
[50:06] holy spirit all right but the baptism is
[50:09] the holy spirit that's why you can have
[50:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day
[50:13] of your life on your spirit go to church
[50:16] read your Bible
[50:19] pray listen to
[50:22] tapes but somewhere you're going to tell
[50:24] what you are on the inside amen
[50:28] sometime it's going to pop right up and
[50:30] you can't help it cuz this is the age of
[50:33] Revelation everything will be made known
[50:36] if the seals are open the Bible's open
[50:38] our lives are
[50:40] open that's why the gifts come into the
[50:42] church to keep it clean keep that
[50:45] garbage
[50:46] out prise the Lord that's the reason it
[50:49] took a prophetic Prophet who brother
[50:51] brandham to come down no Messenger to
[50:53] the age of
[50:54] Pentecost cuz the Holy Ghost came
[50:56] himself self in the fullness of the
[50:59] baptism but at the end of the age
[51:01] remember the messenger comes at the end
[51:03] of the age all right so here comes param
[51:06] and Seymour at the end of the Methodist
[51:10] age brings in a Pentecostal Revival they
[51:14] revive until about 1915 16 17 18
[51:17] remember brother Bram doesn't come on
[51:18] the scene till 47 but remember he's
[51:20] preaching in 33
[51:22] amen cuz he's Baptist remember he starts
[51:25] as a Baptist then he evolves we'll read
[51:27] it this afternoon it evolves through
[51:29] that into the Pentecostal that's the
[51:31] only ones that would accept him because
[51:33] he had a
[51:34] gift had a gift they couldn't deny the
[51:38] gift they didn't like the word that he
[51:41] preached but they couldn't deny that
[51:43] gift when he would stand there and say
[51:45] the doctor's got on a blue coat and
[51:47] you're in a green room and he's got a
[51:49] stethoscope in in his hand and you've
[51:51] got a Blue Dress On I mean he's so
[51:53] specific
[51:57] right they couldn't deny
[51:59] that but they denied the word they took
[52:02] the gift over the giver right that's the
[52:05] Pentecostal problem they took the gifts
[52:08] and said this is it well it doesn't
[52:10] matter if I got you know like brother B
[52:12] said you got a temp her to fight a buz
[52:13] saw or you commit adultery but you can
[52:16] speak in
[52:17] tongues you got it no you don't got
[52:20] it thank God for what a Divine revealer
[52:23] a prophet to come on the scene and put
[52:25] that thing right in order
[52:28] right but at the end of the age it was
[52:30] always ends up the others we find the
[52:32] messenger was sent all these Scruples
[52:34] what all the
[52:37] faults all the Scruples God don't have
[52:42] Scruples we have
[52:45] Scruples and things are to be placed in
[52:48] their place see like that then the
[52:49] Rapture comes for the church now
[52:52] remember Paul wasn't at Pentecost but he
[52:53] said he should have been brother BR was
[52:55] at Pentecost but he said should have
[52:56] been everybody with me on that so now
[52:59] look he didn't deny Pentecost he said it
[53:02] was a place that had to
[53:04] be it was a restored Pentecost back to
[53:08] the same thing the same signs the same
[53:10] message amen there you are all right
[53:13] real quick now we talk about the ones
[53:16] downstairs now remember the one
[53:19] downstairs when I say downstairs they
[53:21] were in
[53:22] a thank you somebody's upper they were
[53:25] in an upper room
[53:28] so there was no elevators back then no
[53:31] escalators back then so they were stairs
[53:35] and they had to come
[53:38] down so they came down to the 3,000 and
[53:42] preached to them so the Holy Ghost had
[53:44] already fell on 120 they were having a
[53:46] Pentecostal Revival these people down
[53:49] here didn't even know where they be
[53:52] there was even a group of people after
[53:53] that that was in the Bible that says we
[53:55] don't even know there be ho Holy Ghost
[53:57] right house of Cornelius or something
[53:58] said we don't even know anything about
[54:00] this Holy Ghost but we sure feel
[54:02] good what did happened Paul or Peter one
[54:06] had to come there with the Holy Ghost
[54:07] Inside of them to breathe on
[54:12] them how important to have the Holy
[54:15] Ghost in your soul the person of God all
[54:18] right real quick so in in ad what I mean
[54:21] back then the Holy Ghost fell on 120
[54:24] mature they were word tutors is
[54:27] everybody with
[54:28] me cuz this is going to be important
[54:30] when we get to
[54:32] Malachi then there was 3,000 babies
[54:35] heard one powerful
[54:37] sermon they were pricked in their heart
[54:40] and said Mitten and Brethren what must
[54:41] we do to have what you
[54:44] got now what's the first thing Peter
[54:46] said go find you a message church and
[54:49] start listening to tapes and reading
[54:51] books no he said
[54:54] repent repent
[54:58] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[54:59] Christ see he was a spokesman he was
[55:01] telling he wasn't telling them something
[55:03] that they did that that that was that
[55:05] was so new that they thought well now
[55:07] the Jesus said father son Holy Ghost
[55:10] Peter was telling them exactly what he
[55:13] said and they accepted
[55:16] it hello they accepted it and they were
[55:21] baptized they baptized 3,000 people in
[55:23] one day
[55:26] it took a lot of them 120 to
[55:28] help to baptize 3,000 people that's
[55:31] that's twice as many people lives in
[55:33] this city because there's only 1,500
[55:35] lives in Lula all
[55:37] right so now isua
[55:40] Street what did the Holy Ghost fall on
[55:43] it fell on children that didn't know
[55:46] anything about this putting it together
[55:49] and they didn't know nothing about a
[55:50] prophet's message they didn't know
[55:52] anything about a seventh angel message
[55:54] that was here that was coming right they
[55:57] didn't know anything about that they
[55:59] just knew this is
[56:01] that they got the Holy Ghost they
[56:03] started speaking in tongues they started
[56:05] prophesying and and as brother Joe we
[56:08] were talking about that before the
[56:09] church he went to a um funeral the other
[56:12] day and there was most of them were
[56:13] women preachers well most of this
[56:15] Pentecost Zea Street were sisters a lot
[56:19] of them well don't get quiet on me I can
[56:23] tell you by history
[56:27] but remember when a prophet
[56:29] comes he's a Divine revealer of the word
[56:32] that's why he kept telling them women
[56:35] Don't Preach they should have read the
[56:38] Bible number one but they got so caught
[56:40] up in the gift see you can get so caught
[56:43] up in the gifts till you forget the give
[56:45] her you forget he said you can't have
[56:48] gifts over the word of
[56:52] God but brother randam put them both
[56:54] together
[56:56] gave us the word and the gifts and put
[56:59] them in
[57:01] order so ausa street now we're at
[57:07] 1906 it fell on
[57:10] children I'll I'll read you quote
[57:12] brother R said babbling Pentecostal
[57:16] babies they didn't like that but you
[57:19] know what he didn't pull no punches when
[57:20] it come to
[57:22] here but would come to maturity through
[57:25] the prophet's message those that stayed
[57:27] in Pentecost they stayed there remember
[57:28] brother Brown said they they wanted to
[57:30] stay in the horse and buggy but we're in
[57:32] the astronaut age they wanted to stay in
[57:34] the automobile but we're in the
[57:35] astronaut age that was a group of people
[57:37] that stood there and they didn't get
[57:38] mature right amen that's right it wasn't
[57:41] that they weren't born Believers either
[57:44] they just didn't move on with
[57:49] God he he he replies to somebody that
[57:52] the Holy Ghost is the same as it was you
[57:54] can't have two different holy ghosts you
[57:56] got one Holy Ghost all
[58:00] right brother Ram said look now look but
[58:02] that predestinated seed don't ask no
[58:04] questions this is 1962 it's thoroughly
[58:07] convinced that it's God moving according
[58:09] to his promise in the Bible a little
[58:11] farther up the road really than isza
[58:13] Street we should be all right he's
[58:16] fixing the Callum Pentecostal
[58:18] babies even even the angel called them
[58:22] Pentecostal babies the angel that was
[58:25] with brother brandham
[58:27] that's right don't get quiet you ought
[58:28] to know
[58:29] that when that Vision
[58:32] came he was fishing got all tied up he
[58:35] said he said you can't teach Pentecostal
[58:38] babies Supernatural
[58:40] things the church should be up here here
[58:42] is starting here it started with a
[58:44] weeping crying and coming into God and
[58:46] it fell
[58:48] away and here's something up here that
[58:50] the church should be up to meet it when
[58:52] he's talking about up there but yet
[58:54] they're not convinced yet that that's
[58:56] the reason they're not
[58:59] concerned then the countdown you
[59:00] remember the countdown we were talking
[59:02] about we know we're in the astronaut age
[59:04] am all right there was a horse and buggy
[59:07] there was a car there was an airplane
[59:09] and then a
[59:11] rocket now listen justification
[59:14] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[59:17] Ghost horse and
[59:19] buggy
[59:21] automobile hello airplane got them off
[59:25] the ground
[59:27] that ain't
[59:28] all you and I live in an astronaut
[59:31] age remember brother Bram said it took
[59:34] four death Messengers to eat it we just
[59:36] said pomor canor and all those and four
[59:38] life Messengers to bring it back
[59:40] justification
[59:42] satification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:45] and then the word being restored we're
[59:47] sitting today under the word being
[59:54] restored how privileged we are let's
[59:56] don't be horse and buggy how many of
[59:59] y'all came here in a horse and buggy
[1:00:01] yeah that's what I
[1:00:07] thought so zusa Street brother Ram is
[1:00:10] emphasizing the Holy Spirit came in its
[1:00:12] fullness in other words it came with
[1:00:14] every gift that they needed
[1:00:18] everything now
[1:00:22] watch the Lord revealed to now this is
[1:00:24] one ey black man this is daddy Seymour
[1:00:26] or William Seymour the Lord revealed to
[1:00:29] him that it was the age for the
[1:00:30] restoration of the gifts and they come
[1:00:33] no matter what it said it came but
[1:00:35] everybody got in the atmosphere of it
[1:00:38] seen it was that age and seen God
[1:00:40] Vindicated that those people could speak
[1:00:41] with tongues and so forth but then when
[1:00:44] he
[1:00:46] went and pinned it down that this is the
[1:00:48] only evidence that killed
[1:00:50] it zza Street lasted till 1915 and
[1:00:54] actually uh Seymour didn't live much
[1:00:56] past that I think he died of a heart
[1:00:57] attack and his wife took
[1:01:00] over and it just went after that
[1:01:03] okay then they started separating this
[1:01:06] that making denominations one coming on
[1:01:08] the cloud the other one coming in the
[1:01:09] bush oh there it
[1:01:13] goes so remember let's piece pull this
[1:01:16] apart real quick and then we'll we'll
[1:01:18] close and have our have our meeting will
[1:01:20] be dismissed and he shall turn this is
[1:01:22] Malachi he shall turn the heart of the
[1:01:24] fathers to the children that's a promise
[1:01:27] that was John the Baptist that was
[1:01:28] number
[1:01:29] three Elijah Elisha John the Baptist
[1:01:33] everybody with me right he stood and
[1:01:37] said Behold the Lamb of God who was he
[1:01:40] talking to he was talking to them old
[1:01:43] Pharisees that were still under the
[1:01:46] law everybody with me so the Old
[1:01:49] Testament fathers the law remember John
[1:01:52] was standing in the middle of it he was
[1:01:55] pulling the Old Testament fathers into
[1:01:58] this new testament
[1:02:01] way got it so that fulfilled he John the
[1:02:05] Baptist shall turn the heart of the
[1:02:08] fathers from the law to this new
[1:02:12] testament babies want me to tell you
[1:02:14] that God in Su times and D manner spake
[1:02:17] in times fast past unto the
[1:02:19] fathers by the
[1:02:21] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[1:02:24] to us by his son
[1:02:27] whom he have the pointed air of all
[1:02:28] things and he made the world First
[1:02:31] Corinthians and I Brethren could not
[1:02:33] speak unto you as to spiritual now this
[1:02:35] is Paul meeting up with the babies
[1:02:38] again everybody with me Paul's meeting
[1:02:41] up with the babies again he can't talk
[1:02:44] spiritual but carnal he's in Corinth
[1:02:47] even as unto babes in Christ now they
[1:02:50] weren't babies in the devil they were
[1:02:51] babies in Christ I have fed you with
[1:02:54] milk right and not with meat for
[1:02:58] hitherto you were not able to Bear it
[1:03:00] neither yet now are you able for you are
[1:03:04] carnal for whereas there is among you
[1:03:06] envy and strife divisions are you not
[1:03:08] carnal and walk as
[1:03:10] men first Peter 2:2 says look as newborn
[1:03:15] babes
[1:03:16] okay so John did his job he took the Old
[1:03:20] Testament
[1:03:22] law
[1:03:24] Pharisees and took them and put them
[1:03:26] into this new era or this New Testament
[1:03:29] and then God sent Apostles prophets
[1:03:31] pastors teachers and evangelists to
[1:03:34] carry him on but they had to start his
[1:03:36] babies
[1:03:37] right everybody with me but that was a
[1:03:41] matured word though it went into the
[1:03:43] ground as we talked about in the fourth
[1:03:44] Church age it come back on isusa Street
[1:03:47] to what back to untrained babies the
[1:03:50] fathers were gone they had they had left
[1:03:53] it back here because what's the fa of
[1:03:56] the fathers it's the true word of God in
[1:03:59] the first three church it's the true
[1:04:00] word of God there was no denomination
[1:04:02] inside in it it was the true word of God
[1:04:04] then man got involved all
[1:04:07] right now then here's me and
[1:04:10] you cuz remember this is the second part
[1:04:13] of
[1:04:14] Malachi and the Heart what's a heart
[1:04:17] soul and the Heart of the
[1:04:22] children back to the fathers in
[1:04:24] Pentecost original
[1:04:26] Pentecost lest I come and smite the
[1:04:28] Earth with the curse so brother brandham
[1:04:30] goes to Pentecostal babes and takes some
[1:04:33] to
[1:04:34] maturity he didn't see it all we're the
[1:04:36] mature group sitting
[1:04:39] here I hope I'm praying I know but now
[1:04:42] watch he said you're using the wrong end
[1:04:44] of the string this is the Angel talking
[1:04:47] to brother brandham in The Vision in
[1:04:51] 1956 and I looked down on the floor and
[1:04:53] they laid truly there laid the string oh
[1:04:55] went out to a nice eighth of an inch and
[1:04:57] taped down real nice and he he said now
[1:05:00] brother brandham he said the angel said
[1:05:02] you can't teach Pentecostal babies
[1:05:05] Supernatural things said you'll cause
[1:05:07] carnal
[1:05:09] impersonations now that's true we know
[1:05:11] it did unfailing word of God he goes to
[1:05:14] 1964 he tells the same vision but
[1:05:17] remember the seals have opened we we'll
[1:05:21] end right here come on you musicians the
[1:05:23] seals have been opened in 196 before so
[1:05:26] watch he tells the same vision but he
[1:05:28] adds something to
[1:05:29] it now I remember what he promised that
[1:05:32] it would continue on and not long ago a
[1:05:35] vision he promised that that pull of
[1:05:37] that line said you can't teach
[1:05:38] Pentecostal babies Supernatural things
[1:05:41] and when I made the third pull all right
[1:05:43] so he's in the third pull part of his
[1:05:44] ministry he said I don't tell nobody
[1:05:47] about this you've been trying to explain
[1:05:50] that other don't tell nobody about this
[1:05:52] this is a great and final pull let's
[1:05:55] take stand at her
[1:05:58] feet he tried to teach the Pentecostals
[1:06:02] they wouldn't listen to him all they
[1:06:04] loved the gifts they loved all that but
[1:06:06] they left the giver out they kicked
[1:06:08] brother randam out they kicked him
[1:06:10] literally out that's right thousands
[1:06:13] down to 20 or 30 people that would even
[1:06:15] listen to him and what did all the
[1:06:17] commentaries even Gordon Lindsay was
[1:06:19] right there with him for about 10 or 15
[1:06:21] years but when brother R started
[1:06:23] preaching he left him you ought to read
[1:06:26] that Auda Street book it's in there in
[1:06:27] the office sister Anna marunga gave it
[1:06:29] to me a while back but you ought to read
[1:06:31] that how they come in and then you had
[1:06:34] your John G Lakes you had FF Bosworth
[1:06:37] you had Smith Wigglesworth you had
[1:06:39] brother brandham you had or Roberts
[1:06:41] Billy Graham uh AA Allen they put every
[1:06:43] one of them in there but what in brother
[1:06:46] brandham they just kind of leaves it
[1:06:47] leave it at the gifts they don't say
[1:06:49] anything about his
[1:06:50] ministry you can't you can't deny he had
[1:06:53] a a gift of Divine Healing
[1:06:56] can't deny it there's millions of people
[1:06:58] can't deny it and the tapes you can't
[1:07:01] deny but boy when he started preaching
[1:07:03] the word of God see that's what
[1:07:04] separated it when he started taking them
[1:07:07] back to the faith of the fathers amen
[1:07:10] when he was trying to pull them out of
[1:07:11] that Pentecostal baby's business lined
[1:07:14] the gifts up he even told the Tabernacle
[1:07:17] one time he said when y'all get these
[1:07:18] gifts lined
[1:07:22] up he said something will happen and
[1:07:26] we'll read it this afternoon where he
[1:07:27] talks about going into
[1:07:29] Rapture keeps Church clean it takes the
[1:07:32] gifts not just speaking in tongues
[1:07:34] because
[1:07:36] honestly when I say the gifts what's the
[1:07:39] first thing you think
[1:07:40] of speaking in tongues
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:46] amen you think well that's not that's
[1:07:48] the last of the
[1:07:49] nine what about wisdom we're going to
[1:07:52] read them this afternoon wisdom Faith
[1:07:54] knowledge yes
[1:07:56] all those things got to be working too
[1:07:57] and then the least of the gifts is
[1:07:59] speaking in tongues and interpretations
