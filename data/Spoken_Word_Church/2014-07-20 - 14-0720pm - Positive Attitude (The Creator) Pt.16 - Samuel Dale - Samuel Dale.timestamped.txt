[38:14] don't know who's going to touch God what

[39:24] Jesus name amen
[39:27] remember Sister Mary too she was still
[39:30] having some problems Sister Mary Dy and
[39:34] uh they haven't heard yet I don't know
[39:36] where they ran the test on her got
[39:39] remember they said she having a lot of
[39:40] hurt in her chest and they put her
[39:42] through or was going to put her through
[39:44] this past week I didn't get the really
[39:48] answer to whether they did or not but uh
[39:51] you know pray that everything will be
[39:53] all right she was still she had had some
[39:55] troubles last night
[39:57] and we believe and Lord will take care
[39:59] of it all right Hebrews 11 now Faith is
[40:03] the substance of things hop for the
[40:06] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[40:09] dealers obtained a good report through
[40:12] faith we understand that the worlds were
[40:14] framed by the word of God so that things
[40:17] which are seen were not made of things
[40:20] which do
[40:22] appear all right now let's go over to
[40:25] Psalms
[40:29] 102 and we'll just read verse 18- 20
[40:33] read it all when you get a chance but
[40:35] it's good says this shall be written for
[40:38] the generation to
[40:39] come and the people which shall be
[40:43] created shall praise the
[40:46] Lord now think of that for them that are
[40:50] created all right CU we believe in a new
[40:53] creation
[40:54] right for he that looked down from the
[40:57] heights of his
[40:59] Sanctuary now listen for he hath looked
[41:03] down from the height of his
[41:07] Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord
[41:11] behold the Earth to hear the groaning of
[41:14] the prisoner to loose those that are
[41:16] appointed to death you may be seated the
[41:19] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[41:21] his
[41:23] word
[41:24] now some of said they really enjoyed
[41:28] our uh what what is it uh it's not
[41:33] geography but talking about this morning
[41:36] of the the things that you know life and
[41:41] beings and how the world and all and
[41:44] remember we went
[41:45] through showing that how in Genesis 1 it
[41:49] says the Heaven and the Earth was
[41:52] created and it stopped there so it could
[41:55] have been billions of years before
[41:57] anything ever took place that's why
[41:59] science can use that to look and and
[42:02] study it and like I said they pick up a
[42:05] bone they take the bone in and when they
[42:08] try to analyze the bone they're
[42:10] analyzing the dirts and the things
[42:11] around it and they're getting a carbon
[42:14] content uh out of that and they saying
[42:17] that bone is millions of years old and
[42:20] uh but we don't believe it that way
[42:22] believe we believe that uh you
[42:25] know
[42:26] the uh creation is in six days and uh
[42:30] the world wasn't created on the first
[42:32] day it was created and then he stopped
[42:36] you know and then the creation started
[42:39] and you know what I love about this
[42:42] message it has the answers if we just
[42:44] search it out uh the prophet said even
[42:47] those dinosaurs they would talk about
[42:49] you know the big Fellers running around
[42:51] so they was running around the Garden of
[42:52] Eden but with no
[42:53] harm well we don't deny all of the those
[42:56] things we believe that but now brother
[42:59] brandom I'll get to it in a second but
[43:02] he didn't I looked it up to make sure
[43:03] cuz I'm always saying this and a lot of
[43:06] people say well brother R said it when
[43:08] uh somebody come up and run it up real
[43:10] quick so he didn't say that well brother
[43:12] randam didn't say the word Big Bang
[43:15] Theory it's not in the in the quotes he
[43:19] didn't use it that way I'll read you in
[43:20] a minute what he said all right but if
[43:24] you remember what we were trying to
[43:25] bring out that the heavens and the Earth
[43:28] were created the Heaven and the Earth
[43:32] and it was in a singular form there
[43:35] because that would be the beginning and
[43:37] be what and any anything else would come
[43:40] from that all right then as it would be
[43:45] that God would allow a great uh Atomic
[43:49] thing to happen and send out it become a
[43:53] uh you know a burning mass and doing the
[43:55] things
[43:56] but then when Paul would pick it up he'd
[43:59] say the
[44:00] worlds were
[44:02] framed all right which means out in
[44:05] space then there's all kind of planets
[44:08] and stars and things you know that you
[44:10] could call worlds and universes and and
[44:14] things that would uh would be there and
[44:17] then that way we don't deny those things
[44:20] we we just believe it but see then Paul
[44:23] was taking it on into a greater form
[44:26] form because he was declaring that uh
[44:30] you know God started it but he created
[44:33] it and he says through faith we
[44:35] understand
[44:38] we then we are first now like as I said
[44:41] this morning the first thing to Psalms
[44:45] is to deal with the
[44:47] creation he didn't start out talking
[44:50] about Abel's great
[44:53] faith he started out talking about
[44:57] true Faith are telling you what faith is
[44:59] the substance of things hope far the
[45:00] evidence Things Not Seen and then he
[45:02] went down to it says true
[45:05] faith our our faith we
[45:10] understand it doesn't say science
[45:13] understands it says we understand we as
[45:16] illiterate people compared to the
[45:19] religious
[45:21] Society can read the word of God and
[45:23] believe it and see that it's very
[45:27] simple how that God created the things
[45:30] and how they were made and and all like
[45:32] that and coming down and then it would
[45:36] come to that point that to where you
[45:40] know it would not
[45:43] stop because our where we've locked our
[45:46] minds to a
[45:47] thought and we'll even quote the prophet
[45:50] you know that that it was a finished
[45:52] physical creation all right we believe
[45:54] that
[45:56] I mean I don't think he's creating more
[45:59] worlds I think it was finished you know
[46:03] Universe was finished stars planets
[46:06] moons whatever you want to call them
[46:09] were finished and that it would be
[46:13] a
[46:15] uh a situation then that whatever would
[46:19] come into being after then would come
[46:22] from that or that same source and as I
[46:26] said then ending up talking about it
[46:28] Jesus could take
[46:30] fish and multiply them
[46:34] right that was coming out of the
[46:37] dirt but then he would say that if you
[46:40] say to this mountain be moved and doubt
[46:42] not in your
[46:44] heart it it be all right then he comes
[46:47] down to us because he placed a little
[46:50] something in there we'll get just a
[46:52] minute in in our
[46:54] reading
[46:56] that he placed a little point in there
[46:58] to show us that it wasn't done but now
[47:01] understand what I'm saying he's not
[47:04] creating more worlds we don't need more
[47:08] worlds all
[47:11] right but he hasn't stopped
[47:14] creating that's our Point we've narrowed
[47:18] that down and think we
[47:22] understand and then when we do we look
[47:25] at it and we don't follow it that here's
[47:30] Moses as the Lord Jesus could take the
[47:32] fish and multiply and fine that's
[47:34] wonderful but see Moses had already said
[47:37] let there be flies fleas
[47:39] frogs now I've told you my honest
[47:41] opinion there I think there were already
[47:44] flies fleas and frogs because they were
[47:47] there in original creation when it was
[47:49] made in Genesis but they was just
[47:52] bringing to being in that area a whole
[47:55] lot more more of them all right and
[47:58] putting them into that place not it was
[48:00] just bringing them in because you would
[48:02] be going back and making some other um
[48:07] creation that was not made in the
[48:09] original creation and I believe all
[48:11] things was made there except the
[48:14] mule I was looking at that the other day
[48:17] brother around said God didn't make the
[48:19] mule he says man made that
[48:23] so good point
[48:26] but thinking about
[48:28] it and see he didn't stop
[48:34] creating he really just
[48:37] started because I said Moses was not
[48:40] greater than the Lord
[48:42] Jesus but Moses could speak flies fleas
[48:46] and frogs into
[48:48] existence all right and here would come
[48:50] the Lord Jesus and you know what he done
[48:54] we'll get to this later in the
[48:59] message brother R talking about it when
[49:01] he says you know receive you the Holy
[49:04] Ghost he breathed on
[49:08] them he said that Holy Ghost didn't come
[49:10] right to them it said it come on to that
[49:13] Pentecost you know what the Lord Jesus
[49:16] was the beginning of the creation of God
[49:18] and we are the continuation of that
[49:20] creation so then he didn't stop all
[49:24] right so watch that in just a
[49:26] second go we start off looking at it as
[49:31] what all things were
[49:35] made created
[49:37] framed formed whatever words you're
[49:42] using was made by the word of
[49:45] God and God spoke it into being by
[49:47] saying let there be and that product or
[49:51] whatever you want to call it came into
[49:53] being all right and and as it came into
[49:56] being it came from an original
[50:00] substance all right and I believe those
[50:03] flies fleas and frogs you know God
[50:06] didn't have to reach down and get the
[50:08] dirt and pull it up and do the things he
[50:11] might have even done that through Moses
[50:13] I don't know but he didn't have to
[50:16] because he he could go back to the
[50:18] original and
[50:21] create so if there's anything coming if
[50:23] we get a limb if we get as we covered
[50:26] right at the end brother R say he
[50:27] believe the limbs would be restored uh
[50:29] and he we talked about the eyesight the
[50:32] I mean the eyes being brought back the
[50:34] different things if those things done
[50:37] without going to the dirt and picking
[50:39] them up then we know for one thing ass
[50:42] sure it didn't come from another planet
[50:45] but it came from the original source
[50:48] that brought this Earth planet World etc
[50:53] etc into being
[50:56] all right from the original
[50:59] source so we're not trying to mold
[51:02] together something and they fly
[51:06] away that's your book of
[51:08] mccabes but we're trying to get back to
[51:12] the spoken word being the Original Seed
[51:16] all right and then I believe that the
[51:19] bride in the end time I believe she down
[51:22] through time has spoken the word
[51:26] but it's going to come into a greater
[51:28] thing and more into our day and our time
[51:33] because we're ending up of all things
[51:36] and I believe you had to speak you
[51:38] remember Wednesday you had to speak your
[51:43] salvation go that's the Bible believe in
[51:45] your heart confess with your mouth all
[51:48] right I believe healing believe in your
[51:50] heart confess in your mouth leave the
[51:52] head out of
[51:54] it all right try to bypass that old
[51:56] thing if you can because we know we
[52:00] can't but you know my point if we could
[52:02] bypass the head it wouldn't be a lot of
[52:04] hindrance the head was where Satan
[52:08] entered there in in the garden to stop
[52:11] up the flu to mess up Eve in the garden
[52:14] was through the head coming down to the
[52:16] memories the reason and conscience all
[52:18] right but now you understand what I mean
[52:22] then the it will say
[52:27] Heaven and
[52:28] Earth but then it says
[52:31] worlds were created brother Brown said
[52:35] if God didn't stop us that we had enough
[52:38] ability within us to create a world and
[52:41] go live on it well I think it evidently
[52:45] must have been possible or he wouldn't
[52:47] have said it all right but just think
[52:50] about it now what we want to do this
[52:53] afternoon is to get down to the Creator
[52:57] part because that was where uh the
[53:00] message was to go to this morning
[53:04] but then if we can see who the Creator
[53:10] is right and then we can see where he's
[53:16] at are you with
[53:20] me and see maybe we'll get away from
[53:22] looking back Yonder or Over Yonder
[53:27] and maybe we'll get a positive
[53:29] attitude about our
[53:32] thinking and think about where he is
[53:36] now and then maybe we can see the
[53:40] possibilities of great
[53:43] things that could take place if we
[53:46] believe
[53:47] it all right so that's the thought of
[53:49] the message now all right so we know
[53:54] then
[53:56] that we start with brother randam and
[53:59] speaking on a message called uh Jesus
[54:03] only authority of the word
[54:06] 1954 excuse me wait a minute we got to
[54:08] pick up these others 3A uh let me read
[54:11] these where you won't think that I'm
[54:14] messing up on something brother brandom
[54:16] as I said I go to threea which is Choice
[54:20] the father brother BR never used the Big
[54:23] Bang Theory you know as we use the
[54:26] word all right so this somebody you know
[54:29] saying well no that's not well then okay
[54:31] let's read him choice of Father under
[54:34] satisfied and look at him back there
[54:37] there he was standing there then after
[54:39] he got the then this after the clinkers
[54:41] went off and the stars and the
[54:43] meteorites were made he's talking about
[54:47] something happened we're get another
[54:49] quote something happened causing those
[54:51] clinkers to come off
[54:53] right I can see this logos go over and
[54:56] hang over this Earth brood over it bring
[55:00] it back here around this sun and begin
[55:03] to break up the ice around it the great
[55:06] big icebergs begin to come down Texas in
[55:09] Oklahoma was formed she run into the
[55:13] Gulf of Mexico down there he was making
[55:16] the ditches and the Plains and whatever
[55:18] he
[55:19] made vegetation and things would come up
[55:22] after a while and after it all got
[55:25] meteored it got melted and the ice run
[55:28] out and made water now we're in Genesis
[55:33] 1 okay now you in Genesis 1 you can take
[55:38] it from right there Genesis 1 it was
[55:41] without form and void and the spirit of
[55:43] God moved upon the waters is that right
[55:45] in the beginning and he separated the
[55:47] water brought up the vegetation and
[55:50] everything okay go to the next one
[55:51] questions and answers 19 and 53
[55:56] three paragraph or yeah paragraph 2
[56:00] 32 now back there then when this little
[56:03] Halo comes and then we can't see nothing
[56:05] yet but yet but just by eyes of just
[56:09] Supernatural we see a Halo standing
[56:11] there now that's the Son of God logos
[56:15] now I can see him playing around like a
[56:17] little child before the father's door
[56:20] with all
[56:21] eternity see and now then in his
[56:25] imaginary
[56:26] makeup he begin to think of what things
[56:30] would be and I can hear him say let
[56:33] there be light and when he did an Adam
[56:36] bursted and the sun came into
[56:39] existence he world for hundreds of
[56:42] millions of years forming clinkers and
[56:44] burning and forming like it is today
[56:47] still burning still breaking
[56:50] atoms I just I gave that this morning
[56:53] and I thought well somebody argue about
[56:55] where and I said it's still going on the
[56:58] universe is moving or whatever the
[57:00] things would be so you know and I looked
[57:03] it up to make sure brother brother
[57:06] didn't say the Big Bang but that's what
[57:08] he's talking about right okay but it
[57:11] started from some great big happening
[57:14] all right bypass number four Jesus The
[57:18] Authority say oh God who made heavens
[57:20] and earth created All
[57:23] Things by
[57:25] Jesus
[57:28] Christ not Jesus the
[57:33] body no Jesus the
[57:37] Christ now who is that Jesus the
[57:41] Christ according to the Bible one day he
[57:44] asked a question who do Man say I the
[57:47] son of man am well you're this you're
[57:50] that or the other who do you say that I
[57:52] am Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[57:55] Living God all right Peter might not
[57:59] have fully
[58:01] understood the thing that he said but he
[58:04] said it perfectly right because he was
[58:07] the creator of God what about the
[58:10] Creator God standing in a part of his
[58:14] own
[58:19] creation he wouldn't three through
[58:21] creating back
[58:23] there
[58:25] and come
[58:27] on we're going to John 1 right go ahead
[58:31] and pull it up but while you're going
[58:33] there verse 14 says and the Word was
[58:36] made flesh and dwelt among
[58:39] us so that means almighty
[58:43] God
[58:45] himself not another the Creator came to
[58:52] Earth all right
[58:55] and he created according to Hebrews
[59:00] 10:5 a body thou has prepared
[59:05] me so he created his own body there's
[59:09] where I love the
[59:11] understanding from the prophet of the
[59:14] Virgin
[59:15] birth because the best we could do of
[59:19] mankind believes that Mary produced The
[59:23] Egg and God produced The Germ sperm
[59:28] whatever and we don't believe
[59:30] that because that would have been sinful
[59:35] man
[59:37] right that would have been the old
[59:39] creation trying to bring a new
[59:42] creation cuz she was part of the old
[59:45] creation right right so it would not be
[59:49] that it would be the new
[59:51] creation you said yeah but he's only
[59:54] only
[59:55] the New Creation in the spiritual
[59:57] there's where you're messing
[59:59] up going run all you quotes in the
[1:00:01] prophet's message of the beginning of
[1:00:03] the creation of God and see if the
[1:00:06] biggest percentage of them doesn't
[1:00:07] relate to the Virgin
[1:00:10] birth and then
[1:00:12] Mary was produced at do you understand
[1:00:15] what I'm saying if Mary would have
[1:00:17] produced the egg it would have been the
[1:00:18] old system bringing forth part which was
[1:00:22] not possible
[1:00:25] he created egg and sperm you say where
[1:00:27] from from the original
[1:00:32] creation where did Moses get the fleas
[1:00:35] and the flogs from the original creation
[1:00:38] where did Brother random get the
[1:00:39] squirrels from the original creation
[1:00:42] where is Lim's things going to be
[1:00:44] restored you think we're going up in a
[1:00:45] Rapture with a lag missing you know hold
[1:00:48] on till I get my wheelchair lined
[1:00:51] up not
[1:00:53] exactly
[1:00:55] all right so it's going to be a creation
[1:00:59] time that we thought was
[1:01:05] over
[1:01:07] right until you heard of this
[1:01:10] message did you know anything about even
[1:01:13] the Virgin birth
[1:01:15] hardly other than argumented
[1:01:20] forms but did you think about it that if
[1:01:23] Mary brought that
[1:01:25] that would be that old
[1:01:27] creation which is dirty
[1:01:30] polluted I hate to think about it but
[1:01:34] she had to be virgin mind and virgin
[1:01:35] wound to be able to even bring forth as
[1:01:38] she did and God had to Barry
[1:01:43] that to use it and connected to the body
[1:01:48] or what do you want to call it of Jesus
[1:01:50] to her physically the word that the food
[1:01:55] the uh minerals Etc would come through
[1:02:00] Mary but not to
[1:02:02] create no virgin birth all
[1:02:06] right now
[1:02:09] then think of what it
[1:02:11] says about this Jesus
[1:02:15] Christ that we talk
[1:02:20] about art the
[1:02:22] Christ the son of the Living
[1:02:26] God th AR the
[1:02:31] Creator because the best they can do
[1:02:33] back there in in h Genesis or the
[1:02:37] writing is to talk
[1:02:39] about a Son of
[1:02:42] God and the Son of God being creating
[1:02:45] all things because that would have to be
[1:02:48] true to match
[1:02:51] up I remember the prophet would
[1:02:53] emphasize he said
[1:02:56] think the Creator
[1:03:00] God lived in human
[1:03:05] flesh but he didn't
[1:03:07] stop he said think that Creator God by
[1:03:12] the new birth now lives in
[1:03:19] you we don't have to call the Creator
[1:03:22] down he's not up in heaven we we got to
[1:03:24] get him down or down we got to get him
[1:03:26] up the Bible plainly tells us
[1:03:29] that he's in thee even n thee in thy
[1:03:32] mouth the word of faith that we
[1:03:36] preach
[1:03:39] right think about the
[1:03:41] Creator living inside of
[1:03:44] you would there be any problem then to
[1:03:46] think about how he could create
[1:03:53] again
[1:03:54] oh no that's not for us that's only for
[1:03:57] brother brandham and the Lord Jesus
[1:04:03] well I just don't agree with that and
[1:04:06] the reason I don't agree with that
[1:04:08] because that would be putting part of
[1:04:09] God in you but not all of God In You by
[1:04:12] the new
[1:04:15] birth and what would that make
[1:04:18] you and make you a demon
[1:04:21] god because that would make him a demon
[1:04:23] god if he didn't have all of it a demon
[1:04:26] god is a secondary God Dema every how
[1:04:30] you spell it a demon god is a secondary
[1:04:33] God it is not the original
[1:04:36] God and that's what the Trinity
[1:04:40] is if you make him another person beside
[1:04:43] the person of almighty God then you're
[1:04:46] making him a Dema God and that's what
[1:04:48] they developed at n of
[1:04:52] Rome that he was not the substance he
[1:04:55] was a like
[1:04:58] substance there's where your Trinity
[1:05:00] come
[1:05:01] from took hundreds of years to get it
[1:05:04] into being you think we going to preach
[1:05:06] it out in two sermons
[1:05:09] no 40 something years I've been
[1:05:11] screaming and hollering about that to my
[1:05:14] own self I
[1:05:18] guess because see I want to see it don't
[1:05:23] you no but think about it
[1:05:28] now Jesus the
[1:05:32] Christ not the man body you know
[1:05:37] Jesus cuz his name was
[1:05:39] Jesus I come in my father's
[1:05:42] name well his father's name was Jesus or
[1:05:45] he had another
[1:05:49] name see then the name of God is what
[1:05:53] Jesus oh you're just a
[1:05:56] Oneness I beg your
[1:05:58] pardon I am Oneness in the bases of the
[1:06:01] true
[1:06:02] Oneness because I believe in
[1:06:06] Oneness but not in the concept of
[1:06:09] organized religion and the Oneness that
[1:06:12] he's one like your
[1:06:14] finger and that Jesus was the lastest
[1:06:17] form of
[1:06:19] God I don't agree with that I believe
[1:06:22] the Bride of Jesus Christ in the Gentile
[1:06:25] dispensation is the LI form of God I
[1:06:29] believe
[1:06:30] that then why don't we believe that that
[1:06:33] Creator God is living within
[1:06:35] us we see we've got him cut
[1:06:38] off you remember what we were using the
[1:06:41] other day about faith was not being
[1:06:43] taught
[1:06:44] correctly and he said let's wake
[1:06:48] up that
[1:06:53] faith
[1:06:55] wake it up in you and
[1:06:58] I let's try to get those dimensional
[1:07:01] things straightened
[1:07:03] out to where we can walk in
[1:07:06] God and see him
[1:07:09] alive all right let's go to John 1 one
[1:07:12] then and just start there because most
[1:07:15] of you know by heart the scriptures I
[1:07:17] give you I got one more I found but
[1:07:19] we'll you know we keep finding little
[1:07:22] things in the word
[1:07:25] so John 1 says in the beginning was the
[1:07:29] word and the Word was with God see we
[1:07:33] want to take that with like somebody
[1:07:36] standing beside
[1:07:39] of you know with somebody standing
[1:07:43] beside of means you're with
[1:07:46] somebody but think about word and
[1:07:52] spirit think about father father and
[1:07:55] son when year would stand a man on
[1:07:59] Earth and he would say I and my
[1:08:04] father are
[1:08:08] one so then it was either God or a
[1:08:14] deceiver so it's not the word with is
[1:08:17] not the point of somebody
[1:08:21] with but it is very beautiful if you
[1:08:24] look at it correctly because you put
[1:08:27] word and spirit
[1:08:29] together you got God you put word and
[1:08:33] spirit today together today you got
[1:08:38] God right you bring the word
[1:08:41] alive you got
[1:08:44] God but see we don't read that other
[1:08:47] part in the beginning was the word the
[1:08:48] word was with God see there we don't
[1:08:51] read the other and the word was
[1:08:54] so the width can't be signifying to
[1:08:59] people because you have to change the
[1:09:01] light's part of the
[1:09:03] verse and the Word was God the same was
[1:09:07] in the beginning with God watch all
[1:09:11] things were made by him and without him
[1:09:16] was not anything
[1:09:18] made that was
[1:09:21] made now this word
[1:09:25] this Scholar's terms of logos
[1:09:30] speech Son of
[1:09:36] God the one true and living
[1:09:39] God not a trinity neither
[1:09:44] a you know it's not a father passing
[1:09:47] down the word to the son or the Holy
[1:09:49] Ghost and the Holy Ghost passing it down
[1:09:51] to the sun go out and speak
[1:09:54] brother Bron says we see a little Halo
[1:09:58] go
[1:09:59] out he said in logos ter in what terms
[1:10:02] that's the word logos he said it means
[1:10:04] Son of
[1:10:07] God and that was the one that said let
[1:10:09] there be cuz he's changing from
[1:10:15] visible I mean pH invisible to
[1:10:19] visible not able to see or comprehend to
[1:10:23] be able to see and comprehend and that's
[1:10:26] what God
[1:10:28] done haven't you heard great sermons
[1:10:30] preached by people that God sent his own
[1:10:34] son he searched through heaven and he
[1:10:38] couldn't find nobody and finally the son
[1:10:41] walked up and they said Daddy Let Me
[1:10:45] Go you ain't never listen to them did
[1:10:49] you sleep then like you do
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:54] but think about
[1:10:55] it see because that's not the only
[1:10:58] scriptures most of you know all the
[1:11:00] scriptures by heart but go to the next
[1:11:03] Ephesians 1:3 tells you
[1:11:08] specifically of a great
[1:11:11] mystery Ephesians 3:9 to make all men
[1:11:15] see what is the great what is the
[1:11:17] fellowship with a mystery which from the
[1:11:20] beginning of the
[1:11:21] world has been hid in God
[1:11:24] who created All Things by Jesus
[1:11:28] Christ Paul had no problem
[1:11:31] defining who he was as a matter of fact
[1:11:33] all of the
[1:11:34] writings except John is mentioned but
[1:11:37] John about the Creator and then Paul
[1:11:40] puts about three in and then Revelations
[1:11:42] brings in one all
[1:11:44] right but you
[1:11:46] see all things were created by
[1:11:49] Him we read in
[1:11:52] John
[1:11:54] now we've defined who is the creator
[1:11:57] Jesus
[1:12:01] Christ so now go to
[1:12:04] Colossians
[1:12:08] one by for by him were all things
[1:12:11] created that are in heaven that are in
[1:12:13] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:12:16] be Thrones dominions or principalities
[1:12:18] or Powers so that pretty well covers
[1:12:21] everything right all things were created
[1:12:25] by Him and for
[1:12:29] him now hold that
[1:12:32] point and he is before all things and by
[1:12:36] him all things
[1:12:41] consist he not only brought
[1:12:45] it but he brought it for a
[1:12:49] purpose and we're
[1:12:52] still
[1:12:56] consisting or
[1:12:59] existing by the
[1:13:03] word you know the word spoke one time
[1:13:05] and the Sun keeps rising and
[1:13:08] set
[1:13:11] right you don't have to go out every day
[1:13:13] and tell the moon to come up and go down
[1:13:15] or
[1:13:17] whatever his word spoke
[1:13:19] it and it's perfectly in harmony with
[1:13:22] everything
[1:13:24] but remember it was created by
[1:13:28] Him and for
[1:13:31] him God had a
[1:13:34] reason to bring the world into
[1:13:41] being now I do
[1:13:45] believe that these
[1:13:47] bodies were taken out of the
[1:13:51] world right
[1:13:54] I believe God molded
[1:13:57] Adam out of the
[1:13:59] earth Prophet said Dar stood with his
[1:14:01] feet anchored into the Earth from when
[1:14:03] he came and then God breathed in his
[1:14:07] nostrils and he became a living
[1:14:10] Soul see no matter what process you want
[1:14:13] to call it mom and daddy eating is what
[1:14:16] brings you and I
[1:14:18] here you
[1:14:20] know because that's that's the way it's
[1:14:22] brought
[1:14:24] all right now so it was for a
[1:14:28] reason that he done this let's go to
[1:14:31] Revelations I noticed this one the other
[1:14:33] day I thought well I'll bring that in
[1:14:34] one more too look at Revelations
[1:14:39] 4:11 he's bragging on
[1:14:42] somebody thou 't worthy oh Lord to
[1:14:45] receive glory and honor and
[1:14:48] power for thou H has created all
[1:14:52] things
[1:14:55] and for thy
[1:14:57] pleasure they are and
[1:15:00] were
[1:15:03] created so there's anything ever going
[1:15:05] on now if there's a limb to be
[1:15:08] restored it'll be for his honor and
[1:15:14] glory and ain't going to be just because
[1:15:16] you think you got the
[1:15:20] power it ain't going to be you and me
[1:15:23] running her big mouth and saying we can
[1:15:25] do
[1:15:30] it just remember even your prophet he
[1:15:34] said God challenged him upon on the
[1:15:42] word he wasn't just out there going and
[1:15:44] create
[1:15:46] squirrels God challenged him on the
[1:15:50] word because remember the question he
[1:15:53] had
[1:15:56] he had a question on that scripture if
[1:15:58] you'll go back and read
[1:16:00] it he
[1:16:02] said if anybody asked me about that he
[1:16:07] said I would say that that was in other
[1:16:10] words an Old
[1:16:11] Testament Covenant
[1:16:15] part all right other words putting it
[1:16:19] somewhere that it wouldn't be for you
[1:16:21] and I
[1:16:26] but he said God wanted to show him that
[1:16:28] was much as the word as I think he said
[1:16:32] John 3:16 I'm not
[1:16:35] certain to challenge him on that
[1:16:41] word and speak
[1:16:46] it you know what he spoke it you know
[1:16:49] what it
[1:16:51] created but but it was for
[1:16:54] him not brother
[1:16:57] random it was for God's honor and glory
[1:17:00] and all things are doing any creation
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:05] comes it's not going to be well I think
[1:17:08] the Lord's going to give me a world
[1:17:09] record deer I'll just speak it into
[1:17:12] existence what you got a reason
[1:17:15] for well it need some meat you don't
[1:17:18] need a world record to eat it wouldn't
[1:17:20] taste too
[1:17:22] good you're going to speak anything it's
[1:17:25] you a young D or a little button head
[1:17:28] Buck or a
[1:17:31] spike you see there's too many I told
[1:17:34] you the other day too many eyes
[1:17:36] involved I'll do this and I'll do that
[1:17:40] and everybody will know that I have the
[1:17:44] power uhuh power of that character is
[1:17:47] what
[1:17:50] satanic oh it's Satan doing it what's
[1:17:52] them i i i i all right but now think
[1:17:57] about
[1:17:58] it I want to establish this so giving
[1:18:01] you certain quotes to establish a
[1:18:05] point look at number nine which is the
[1:18:09] fourth taken from the fourth
[1:18:11] seal paragraph
[1:18:15] 33 and when the word of the Lord came to
[1:18:19] him Lord came in him he spoke
[1:18:23] F and even things
[1:18:28] created by the
[1:18:32] word that was Moses wasn't
[1:18:40] it created by the
[1:18:44] word all
[1:18:46] right a
[1:18:50] creation come into being
[1:18:53] by the
[1:18:55] word everything that's created is a
[1:18:59] spoken
[1:19:00] word now that's the reason I'm dealing
[1:19:03] with called The Creator this
[1:19:06] afternoon is to deal with the word being
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] Creator in the beginning was the word
[1:19:13] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:19:16] all things were created by the word and
[1:19:20] without that word creating there was
[1:19:23] nothing ever was or ever will be
[1:19:29] created all
[1:19:33] right sin is not a creation I just gave
[1:19:37] you that one and R around says there's
[1:19:40] nothing created but
[1:19:43] Perfection number 10 adoption paragraph
[1:19:47] 52 God created all things good sin is
[1:19:52] not not a creation it's a
[1:19:56] perversion all
[1:19:59] right not there's only one
[1:20:02] Creator you can't have more
[1:20:05] creators so if anything happens again
[1:20:08] it's going to be God
[1:20:11] again but where am I trying to get you
[1:20:13] to see where God is
[1:20:17] at in
[1:20:21] you not up in
[1:20:24] heaven we talk about the Bible you know
[1:20:27] we say all things are possible it
[1:20:29] doesn't say all things are possible to
[1:20:32] God we know
[1:20:34] that all things are possible to them
[1:20:38] that
[1:20:43] believe well you sound like brother Dale
[1:20:45] you're talking about one of these days
[1:20:47] we might speak something I am not
[1:20:50] talking about and for 40 something years
[1:20:54] I have not talked about a God that was
[1:20:58] going to do
[1:21:03] something if that's what you think you
[1:21:06] need to go back and listen again 40
[1:21:08] something years
[1:21:11] worth when a man tells you the first
[1:21:14] sermon he preached that the Bride of
[1:21:16] Jesus Christ would be the fullness of
[1:21:19] the godhead bodily that she would be the
[1:21:21] son of man
[1:21:23] am I wouldn't take too much of a
[1:21:26] negative attitude about that
[1:21:32] person that's one thing I've always been
[1:21:34] about the word of God
[1:21:40] positive very positive about the
[1:21:45] word well brother Dale I just had done
[1:21:48] that I'm just well that's
[1:21:51] good I'm not throwing off on you I just
[1:21:55] talk about what happened in my life
[1:21:57] whether you believe it or
[1:21:59] not right but some of you have been
[1:22:03] around a while and maybe you're
[1:22:05] beginning to think a little bit about it
[1:22:07] anyway hey this old boy has preached the
[1:22:11] same thing for 40 something
[1:22:17] years Brother Dean gave me some tapes on
[1:22:20] faith preached many many years ago I
[1:22:22] ain't had a chance listen to him yet but
[1:22:24] you know 77 and I could probably tell
[1:22:27] you about what's on
[1:22:30] there and I'm still talking about the
[1:22:32] same God and still talking about where
[1:22:35] that God's
[1:22:36] at a God in heaven won't do you any
[1:22:43] good a god beside of you perusia
[1:22:47] paria that won't do you any
[1:22:51] good a god God living in
[1:22:54] you your Resurrection is in you amen the
[1:22:59] change of your body is in
[1:23:02] you we just got to get it
[1:23:05] out
[1:23:07] right we got to get it out into being
[1:23:11] right to
[1:23:13] work and then not make it so big until
[1:23:16] we came a
[1:23:17] time well that was just for brother
[1:23:20] bradam and the Lord Jesus see you've
[1:23:22] automatically put a doubt in people's
[1:23:25] mind and doubt in our
[1:23:28] mind you can't have a positive attitude
[1:23:31] with doubt in your
[1:23:35] mind did the prophet say the right
[1:23:37] mental attitude the word any promise he
[1:23:40] just said the right menal
[1:23:42] latitude he didn't say the super duper
[1:23:45] revelation of all he just said the right
[1:23:47] mental
[1:23:48] attitude we bring it to
[1:23:51] bi
[1:23:53] yeah but brother tell you don't
[1:23:54] understand we're we're over here we're
[1:23:55] not back there like
[1:23:57] them sometimes I wonder if they didn't
[1:24:00] have more than we
[1:24:04] do you know what I
[1:24:06] mean go on to the next one resurrection
[1:24:10] of Jar's daughter I know I got to quit
[1:24:16] again look what he
[1:24:20] says believe with all your heart you
[1:24:22] shall see the glory of the Lord glory of
[1:24:25] God the Lord Jesus Christ who is raised
[1:24:27] from the dead stands here in this
[1:24:29] audience
[1:24:31] now that was the things that when that
[1:24:33] Prophet when I first heard him talking I
[1:24:37] knew the
[1:24:38] theological things of
[1:24:43] churches what I mean by that I knew
[1:24:45] their doctrines their
[1:24:48] ways we're going to heaven one of these
[1:24:51] days
[1:24:53] but I got problems now but I'm here in a
[1:24:56] human being and one day I'm going to get
[1:24:58] me a new
[1:25:02] body ain't something wrong
[1:25:06] here when brother Ram started
[1:25:11] talking isn't it odd that I've been on
[1:25:14] faith now for quite a while and What's
[1:25:16] the title of brother brandom's first
[1:25:20] sermon that he preached in that
[1:25:23] 1947 faith is the
[1:25:27] substance the first recorded
[1:25:31] message begins with a man speaking of
[1:25:35] Faith he didn't speak of a God if in
[1:25:40] heaven he spoke of a God on Earth living
[1:25:44] in
[1:25:46] mankind I wish I could drive that
[1:25:50] down the god of William
[1:25:53] brandom come
[1:25:56] on
[1:25:58] Elisha wasn't questioning whether God
[1:26:02] existed when he said were be the god of
[1:26:06] Elijah he was just simply making a
[1:26:08] statement if God was there if God is
[1:26:10] here he gave me the the double portion I
[1:26:13] got the double portion oky doie he must
[1:26:15] be here if he's over there he's
[1:26:18] here he wasn't questioning where he was
[1:26:21] at
[1:26:23] he turned around smoked the water just
[1:26:25] walked
[1:26:27] across done Twice The Miracles that
[1:26:29] Elijah
[1:26:32] done but think about
[1:26:34] it look what he says the Lord Jesus
[1:26:38] Christ is raised from the dead stands
[1:26:40] here in this audience now his great
[1:26:42] magnificent being the anointed one from
[1:26:45] on high on glorious High who blowed the
[1:26:50] worlds all from his hands as it
[1:26:57] was right who created All Things by
[1:27:02] Christ Jesus has come up from the dead
[1:27:05] and shed
[1:27:06] forth this which you do now see and
[1:27:13] hear a living God look at the next
[1:27:17] one I love this one taken from Jehovah
[1:27:20] Gyra 57
[1:27:23] paragraph or E31 and the Creator who
[1:27:28] created all things and who made the
[1:27:31] world by his own word the very dirt that
[1:27:33] you're sitting over tonight is nothing
[1:27:36] in the world but God's word made
[1:27:40] manifest let me put it this way the dirt
[1:27:43] we're setting in
[1:27:44] today is that all
[1:27:49] right amen God said let let there be and
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:54] was he believed his own
[1:27:58] word I know that quote's been with me 40
[1:28:01] something years he believed his own
[1:28:07] word well I'll go out there and try it
[1:28:12] no he believed his own
[1:28:15] word every material thing come from the
[1:28:19] supernatural every material thing come
[1:28:22] from the supernatural God spoke the
[1:28:24] world into existence if he
[1:28:27] didn't where did he get the material to
[1:28:29] make it
[1:28:30] with now that's what he's saying are you
[1:28:33] reading that if he didn't speak it into
[1:28:35] existence where'd he get
[1:28:40] it are you reading it if he didn't speak
[1:28:43] it into existence where'd he get
[1:28:47] it but that's what he done he made it
[1:28:51] because it's his word he spoken and said
[1:28:53] let there be and it was and When God
[1:28:56] says
[1:28:57] anything if you'll accept it and hold
[1:29:04] on accept it and hold
[1:29:08] on let's read this one then we preach a
[1:29:12] second and
[1:29:13] quit when Divine love is projected
[1:29:16] Sovereign Grace takes over
[1:29:20] E8 and God Creator who created All
[1:29:23] Things by his power through his spoken
[1:29:26] word and everything that is is the word
[1:29:29] of God made
[1:29:31] manifest en our world was
[1:29:34] made and how we do error when we try to
[1:29:39] ignore God's word or try to limit God's
[1:29:44] power by our own
[1:29:50] imagination would you read it over and
[1:29:52] over and
[1:29:55] over and how we do
[1:29:59] error when we try to ignore God's word
[1:30:02] or try to limit God's power by our own
[1:30:08] imagination you don't stop on those
[1:30:10] things and
[1:30:12] think so it's a great
[1:30:14] era
[1:30:20] to limit God's
[1:30:25] power how do you limit God's power by
[1:30:27] your
[1:30:34] imagination I'm serious how do you limit
[1:30:37] God's power by your
[1:30:39] imagination but if you imagine something
[1:30:41] contrary to
[1:30:43] him right that's sensible if you imagine
[1:30:47] something contrary to him you limit
[1:30:50] him if you're thinking what he says it
[1:30:54] doesn't limit
[1:30:56] him and look at the Great era that we've
[1:30:59] been
[1:31:03] taught well the spoken word is only for
[1:31:05] brother brandham and the Lord
[1:31:13] Jesus
[1:31:18] right did you think you're going to
[1:31:20] speak the word
[1:31:23] one of them said
[1:31:25] hogwash and if I had heard them I
[1:31:27] wouldn't quote
[1:31:34] him you said well brother Dale that
[1:31:36] man's got probably hundreds of thousands
[1:31:39] of
[1:31:40] followers and he's deceived them
[1:31:48] everyone he's deceived
[1:31:50] him
[1:31:54] by just limiting
[1:31:56] God by an
[1:31:58] imaginations well I just don't see how
[1:32:00] that can be
[1:32:04] so uh may I paraphrase a
[1:32:08] quote something like this that who are
[1:32:12] you to say those
[1:32:15] things I got to quote part of it in my
[1:32:18] mind but who are you to say those things
[1:32:21] by what are
[1:32:22] Authority do you say that God is not the
[1:32:26] same yesterday today and
[1:32:31] forever who gives you that
[1:32:37] right well that's what I
[1:32:40] think well what you think and what I
[1:32:43] think ain't worth a good
[1:32:48] thk don't tell you miss that I guess
[1:32:51] simply means it's not worth even
[1:32:53] thinking
[1:32:54] about old southern Georgia language a th
[1:32:58] a
[1:33:00] thought all
[1:33:03] right who gives you and I the
[1:33:08] right to
[1:33:10] think of anything contrary in Hebrews
[1:33:19] 13:8 well brother Dale I think he was
[1:33:21] godone here but he wouldn't God till he
[1:33:23] come over
[1:33:25] here now where did you get that I got a
[1:33:30] quote no you got a
[1:33:33] coat because you refuse to listen to the
[1:33:36] others where he says he's all everything
[1:33:39] in
[1:33:40] between and why would our peanut brain
[1:33:44] try to think about a God in one age they
[1:33:47] wouldn't be the same God in the next age
[1:33:49] now I agree that the people in the ages
[1:33:53] changes but not to
[1:33:57] God God can't change that's what he said
[1:34:01] he said I'm God and I change
[1:34:05] not but what gives any of us any
[1:34:07] authority to doubt the word of
[1:34:14] God do you think you're some kind of
[1:34:16] something great that the world can't
[1:34:18] operate without
[1:34:20] you told about that Manar the cotton
[1:34:22] mill games one
[1:34:24] time he thought man him and his boys
[1:34:27] that the plant couldn't operate without
[1:34:29] him he got mad he went and got his boys
[1:34:31] walked out the
[1:34:33] door he said got outside come find out
[1:34:36] they still
[1:34:38] operating he went back inside and went
[1:34:40] to
[1:34:42] work you
[1:34:47] know you see you're looking at a man
[1:34:49] that knows one thing
[1:34:52] God don't have to have this
[1:34:55] man he don't have to have you he don't
[1:34:59] have to have
[1:35:00] me we have to have
[1:35:05] him you said well he's got to have
[1:35:07] somebody yeah but that don't have to be
[1:35:10] us and if we think he can't do it
[1:35:13] without us just remember he already
[1:35:18] has but listen Church when I first heard
[1:35:22] that
[1:35:23] Prophet speaking of a living
[1:35:31] God yeah I done had the contact with him
[1:35:33] so I knew there was a living God I just
[1:35:35] didn't have nobody to help
[1:35:38] me and I've done told you I wasn't born
[1:35:42] again two years after coming in this
[1:35:46] message and I count none of that as my
[1:35:49] new
[1:35:50] birth
[1:35:57] what you see
[1:35:58] Church why can't we as just sensible
[1:36:01] human
[1:36:02] beings believe one
[1:36:05] thing I know I make this statement and
[1:36:07] it just goes chilled I see it but if
[1:36:09] there is a
[1:36:11] God that's not me questioning where he
[1:36:14] exists or not if there is a God and he
[1:36:17] can't keep his word
[1:36:19] straight then I have no desire to serve
[1:36:22] that
[1:36:26] God if there's a God that would back up
[1:36:29] wouldn't back up his word he's not God
[1:36:32] cuz he and his word are
[1:36:38] one he spoke it and the sun rises and
[1:36:43] sets
[1:36:46] right but a man took his word one day
[1:36:50] and said Sons stand
[1:36:52] still and at the words of a
[1:36:57] man God stopped the
[1:37:05] world maybe he's M waiting on you and
[1:37:10] I maybe he's waiting to see what we'll
[1:37:18] do you never heard me come out here and
[1:37:21] do this do that and tell the thing no
[1:37:23] but when I come out here and tell
[1:37:25] you you can go to the bank with it and
[1:37:27] don't worry about it
[1:37:31] right well because I'm not going to talk
[1:37:33] to you about something that he hadn't
[1:37:35] talked to me
[1:37:39] about and showed me that in his
[1:37:42] word I liked old brother Maloney come on
[1:37:45] Brothers I like told Brother Maloney and
[1:37:47] he had in his Bible he had TP and he'd
[1:37:50] put it in in the spoken word books and
[1:37:52] he had TP so one day I asked him I said
[1:37:55] brother Maloney what does that TP stand
[1:37:58] for I see it a lot in there he said
[1:38:01] tried and
[1:38:03] proven I thought
[1:38:05] well that's a good
[1:38:08] point he had tried it and he had proved
[1:38:13] it what about
[1:38:15] it think on these things let's Stand
[1:38:18] Together the Creator God
[1:38:22] way'll be preaching Wednesday the Lord
[1:38:24] willing I'll finish this next week don't
[1:38:26] have don't worry about
[1:38:30] it but the one thing that I'm trying my
[1:38:33] best to get you and I to see the god
[1:38:36] that's living in You by the new birth is
[1:38:40] the same God that said let there
[1:38:44] be why couldn't he come right back to
[1:38:50] you
[1:38:52] if you have to speak your
[1:38:53] salvation if you have to speak your
[1:38:56] healing why would it not be that you
[1:38:58] would have to speak a change of the
[1:39:06] body Hallelujah what's the
[1:39:10] problem I must say that I'm already
[1:39:12] healed before I can receive my healing
[1:39:15] right I must say I'm already saved
[1:39:17] before I receive my salvation why would
[1:39:20] it not be I would have to say that I'm
[1:39:21] already
[1:39:24] changed before the change could
[1:39:27] come is there any problem with
[1:39:33] that there's no problems if faith is a
[1:39:36] true
[1:39:37] substance but if not there will be what
