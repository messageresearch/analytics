[11:20] now to you in Jesus name
[11:23] amen
[11:26] Revelations 1
[11:31] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[11:33] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[11:35] things which must shortly come to pass
[11:37] and he sent and signified it by his
[11:39] Angel unto his servant
[11:41] John who by record of the word of God
[11:44] and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[11:46] all things that he saw blessed is he
[11:49] that readeth and they that hear the
[11:50] words of this prophecy and keep those
[11:53] things which are written therein for the
[11:56] time is at hand now we'll read
[12:00] Revelations 14 like verse
[12:02] 1-5 we got part of it Wednesday but then
[12:05] we want to continue on through these
[12:07] other couple of verses and I looked and
[12:10] L lamb stood on Mount s with him and
[12:14] 144,000 having the father's name written
[12:17] to their foreheads and I Heard a Voice
[12:20] from Heaven say voice from Heaven as the
[12:23] voice of many Waters and as the voice of
[12:25] a great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[12:27] Harpers harping with the their hearts
[12:30] and they sang as it were a new song
[12:32] before the throne and before the four
[12:34] beasts and the elders and no and no man
[12:37] could learn that song but
[12:40] 144,000 which were redeemed from the
[12:42] earth these are they which were not
[12:44] defiled with women for they are virgins
[12:48] these are they which follow the lamb
[12:50] withs soever he goeth these were
[12:53] redeemed from among men being the first
[12:55] fruits unto God and to the lamb and in
[12:58] their mouth was found no G for they are
[13:01] without fault Before the Throne of God
[13:04] you may be seated Lord that is blessing
[13:06] to the reading of the word
[13:11] now we won't try to back up too much on
[13:14] the Wednesdays
[13:15] but we have no problems as we said
[13:18] Wednesday
[13:19] seeing who this group of people is you
[13:22] know some places in there you could read
[13:24] and it would maybe uh say something and
[13:26] you would wonder but emphatically States
[13:29] two times there verse 1 and verse three
[13:32] that this is the
[13:34] 144,000 of the children of Israel right
[13:37] this is the same ones that we see over
[13:40] in Revelation
[13:42] 7 and but to me this is giving a better
[13:45] or more clearer definition or
[13:48] understanding because in Revelation 7
[13:50] you list
[13:52] 144,000 and you have uh Dan and Ephraim
[13:56] missing and the prophet said when you
[13:58] come to re Gans the 14th chapter that
[14:02] that
[14:03] is the 144,000 back in perfect tribal
[14:06] order with Joseph and Levi uh taken out
[14:10] and Dan and Ephraim put back showing the
[14:13] Redemptive plan of God Amen you see no
[14:16] wonder then as we read there in the
[14:18] scripture that they sang a new song as
[14:21] it were it says a new song all right
[14:24] it's the song of redemption but it's not
[14:26] the
[14:27] same how would you said I tried to get
[14:30] across Wednesday uh the
[14:32] verses you know would be it would be
[14:36] different verses to this song than there
[14:38] is to our song which is the redeemed
[14:41] amen you know we are the children of
[14:45] God the redeemed you know and and we
[14:48] have the Bible says we can sing a new
[14:50] song cuz we do you know our song is no
[14:53] longer like it was in the world but now
[14:56] it's in Jesus Christ and we have a new
[14:58] song
[14:59] but then they sing because their Plan of
[15:02] Redemption is not exactly like ours
[15:05] because even though it gives them
[15:07] eternal life here in the world right
[15:10] they're still not the children of God
[15:13] right and we'll get back to that in a
[15:14] minute they are the servants all right
[15:17] and but yet still they can sing that
[15:19] song and I tried to emphasize like you
[15:22] know that each age has
[15:25] songs you see you you had the the the
[15:28] song like Wesley them of the blood you
[15:31] know a lot of songs were written in that
[15:33] day about the blood well that was the
[15:35] day and the hour that was the time that
[15:37] was the that was the song they were
[15:39] singing of redemption right all right
[15:41] then you come on over into the the
[15:44] Pentecostals and you begin to sing you
[15:46] know about how that we were one of them
[15:49] and and all the different songs wrote by
[15:52] Pentecostal people and the one is
[15:54] especially writing a lot about Jesus you
[15:57] know and emman
[15:59] and all like that but then when you come
[16:02] on over into the message of the hour see
[16:05] look at the songs that are being written
[16:07] by the people you know the token the
[16:10] different songs that the people this
[16:12] message sing related to right this hour
[16:17] right see so you can see I was trying to
[16:19] illustrate that's that's a new song each
[16:22] age receives a song or writes songs and
[16:25] sings about the Redemption of their age
[16:29] and their time amen all right so then
[16:31] your
[16:32] 144,000 would not sing the song of
[16:35] redemption as the bride right that would
[16:38] not be their song see but it would be
[16:41] the song of
[16:43] redemption but it' be according to where
[16:46] the Redemption made them servants
[16:49] instead of you know making them Sons and
[16:52] Daughters of God all right then that was
[16:54] you know hoping that would you would
[16:56] follow that along and
[16:59] then when we get into this now today I
[17:02] want you to notice something
[17:04] that Lord Jesus notice what they're
[17:07] called
[17:09] yeah in in our message today we would
[17:12] deal with the fact of the Bible covering
[17:14] them to be
[17:16] virgins we will deal with the fact of
[17:18] them being servants right we will deal
[17:22] with the fact of them being the remnant
[17:24] of the Jews all right then brother
[17:27] Brandon will pick it up and call them
[17:32] Unix no and and bringing it on over into
[17:35] another form and God would call them
[17:40] then the chosen of the Lord that would
[17:44] that would tie together all the
[17:46] scriptures and and even though they're
[17:48] not the bride of
[17:50] Christ they are the chosen right they're
[17:53] the
[17:53] predestinated right group of people and
[17:55] we'll get down to it in the message in a
[17:57] minute they they're a special Elite
[18:00] group of people this 144,000 that we've
[18:03] been talking about they are the Elite of
[18:06] God you know that that won't be shameful
[18:09] to get there and we won't look down on
[18:11] them I want to make sure to emphasize
[18:14] one thing to you we we have thought
[18:16] about the
[18:18] 144,000 and and the prophet as we'll
[18:20] read in a minute and and a lot of times
[18:22] we just refer to them to being
[18:25] servants well you know uh that would be
[18:29] like you know that you you've got a
[18:32] servant and you tell the servant to go
[18:35] do this or to go do that you know but I
[18:38] I believe that's not the emphasis upon
[18:40] the word servant of the
[18:44] 144,000 you know all right it would be a
[18:47] great
[18:49] opportunity to be able
[18:53] to qualify right for this group of
[18:58] people amen you know I mean out of all
[19:01] of Israel there's going to be 144,000
[19:03] chosen but we know they were chosen
[19:05] before the foundation of the world but
[19:07] they have a specific position or place
[19:10] position or whatever you want to call it
[19:12] right to exist in and that's a wonderful
[19:15] position and it's not like a servant
[19:17] that you know right uh brother Brady and
[19:21] them if you remember they used to work
[19:23] for these people that the queen would
[19:25] come over and you know they were like
[19:28] servants
[19:29] but he said one time he said we didn't
[19:31] consider ourselves to be low form no you
[19:34] know right they sure didn't no we didn't
[19:37] consider ourselves to just be nothing
[19:40] nor right he told me a many of time that
[19:42] that the guy that where he stayed at
[19:44] that he would you know he would talk to
[19:46] him and argue with him about something
[19:48] one time he was telling about that that
[19:51] they you know they were servants and
[19:52] they didn't get to full Porter House
[19:55] State and you know they would get the
[19:57] trimming and what was left over maybe a
[19:59] different type of
[20:00] mistake but the old dog that they had
[20:04] got the Porter House
[20:05] steak you know he got his own cook for
[20:08] him because he was part of that yeah but
[20:11] he said one day then he just wound up
[20:13] and something happened and the dog was
[20:15] killing chickens I don't remember the
[20:17] whole story but he wound up killing the
[20:19] old dog you know well the the master
[20:23] didn't jump on him and scream at him he
[20:25] just he just said the dog's dead you
[20:28] know
[20:29] to the master to the dog dead well he
[20:32] didn't argue with him about it he
[20:33] figured he probably you know had a
[20:35] reason for killing it but what I mean is
[20:37] brother said we didn't feel like that we
[20:39] were right lower class
[20:42] people you
[20:44] know see even the word servant we go
[20:46] down to a to a restaurant and and make
[20:49] sure you do that brother R said make
[20:51] sure you pay those wages and and you
[20:54] know you tip them when you go tip them
[20:57] good because that's their job you and
[20:59] see that's a servant but they're being
[21:01] paid for those jobs so there's all kind
[21:04] of the word servant that's right but the
[21:05] main thing I want us to see today is
[21:08] that you can call them virgin you can
[21:10] call them unic you can call them
[21:11] servants you can call them Remnant you
[21:13] can call them chosen you you got many
[21:15] names for this 144,000 and they have a
[21:19] beautiful position oh yeah there you
[21:22] know in the Lord for you and I and
[21:25] that's what we'll we'll try to get to
[21:27] and to see the point but as I was saying
[21:32] Wednesday
[21:33] then
[21:35] these these people
[21:37] here don't count them as to be a low
[21:40] class or they're our
[21:43] servants well now you won't be there
[21:46] right I'm just going to put it plain
[21:49] right if that's the way you think that
[21:51] they're your servants boy we're going to
[21:53] lay back and they're going to serve us
[21:56] now you show me where brother Brown talk
[21:58] like that that's right you
[22:01] know you show me that right see to be
[22:05] paid to be a servant is a livelihood
[22:07] right right you know a waiter Etc but
[22:11] what about when you get eternal life it
[22:15] right there what about eternal life and
[22:17] a special place set aside for you that
[22:20] nobody else can obtain under that that's
[22:24] right and they can't even sing the song
[22:26] about it
[22:29] that's something is it when don't we get
[22:31] down in the scriptures a little bit you
[22:33] know I'm try to try to cover it but just
[22:35] think
[22:37] now Revelations 14 I got it in there for
[22:40] them to bring up but we don't have to
[22:42] bring these couple up to save a little
[22:44] time Revelations
[22:47] 14:4 the you don't have any Scripture
[22:51] Let Me Maybe I rephrase it it could be
[22:54] something linking together but you don't
[22:56] have a scripture that just calls you 144
[22:58] th000 Unix
[23:00] right right that's the point I want you
[23:03] to get because that's like when the
[23:04] minut when we say they're Unix then
[23:06] you're going to throw your mind into a
[23:08] gear of thinking about you know what
[23:11] they are but see the Bible says they're
[23:13] virgins the Bible says they're they're
[23:16] servants the Bible says that they're The
[23:18] Remnant well let's don't even think
[23:21] about when we get to the word unic as to
[23:24] be a sterile person you know someone
[23:27] that's incapable of bearing children and
[23:30] see then that's like I said Wednesday
[23:32] you get into those things until people
[23:34] will even say well you know you got to
[23:36] be married to preach yeah well Jesus
[23:40] yeah didn't have a natural wife so we
[23:43] just disqualified him and then Paul says
[23:46] I got a right to marry but I won't we'll
[23:49] give you these at the
[23:50] end and you start getting into all of
[23:53] those and it comes from some man's ideas
[23:55] or thoughts you know down through that
[23:58] we take and it's because of certain ways
[24:01] things are said or something like that
[24:03] but let's get into the scriptures of it
[24:05] and just see what we're talking
[24:09] about now as I made the statement you
[24:11] can go see from Revelations 14 and it
[24:14] calls them
[24:15] virgins and it says they follow the lamb
[24:19] withs soever he goeth
[24:23] right says these were redeemed from
[24:26] among men being the first fruits unto
[24:30] God and to the lamb right amen see then
[24:33] when we refer to first fruits a lot of
[24:35] times we try to make that bride see
[24:37] that's why that you know you you've got
[24:40] all kind of doctrines about the Book of
[24:42] Revelations because you get over into
[24:44] the Gentiles and look at it as first
[24:46] fruits but then when you read first
[24:48] fruits here you say this is first fruit
[24:49] it's bride yeah so then you got all your
[24:52] doctrines at that 144,000 with the bride
[24:55] you know and the the the British Israel
[24:57] doctrines and and the things that that
[24:59] come in there but keep it in the correct
[25:01] order and you'll find out they're true
[25:03] virgines amen all right keep it in true
[25:06] order and you'll find out in Revelation
[25:09] 7 that you seal these Servants of our
[25:13] God in their
[25:15] fourheads all right
[25:18] now you remember how we were trying to
[25:21] bring that out about the forehead see
[25:22] the foreheads where your understanding
[25:24] is you know intelligence part
[25:26] communication Etc is in your for forhead
[25:29] all right and see then the mark of the
[25:31] beast is in your forehead because that's
[25:33] a Doctrine right but now remember that
[25:37] this
[25:39] point you can't be on both sides right
[25:44] all right right we either have the Seal
[25:47] of God or we have the mark of the beast
[25:49] right amen all right it's one of the two
[25:51] it's not no no uh gray area but remember
[25:56] how we tried to bring it out Wednesday
[25:57] because this is what I I I believe that
[26:01] see Martin Luther in his soul had
[26:03] eternal life amen sealed in by the Holy
[26:06] Spirit he had the Seal of God Amen but
[26:08] in his
[26:10] intelligence he was still a trinitarian
[26:13] that's right all right and even said the
[26:15] Jews were to be taken out and destroyed
[26:17] you know or something like that because
[26:19] he was a human being under that period
[26:22] of time right of the man you know of the
[26:26] the combat Beast right and not under the
[26:28] end time right see you tell him you
[26:31] today you say well the Jews ought to be
[26:32] killed I say well you got a problem
[26:34] brother sister you need to repent right
[26:38] because what we're talking about here
[26:39] they're going to be so close to us in
[26:41] the Millennium amen right until you
[26:43] going to be telling them they ought to
[26:44] be killed and they go over in the
[26:45] Millennium and they're guarding you
[26:47] right or your escorts or your servants
[26:50] or your
[26:52] whatever y all right Martin Luther under
[26:55] that time God would not account those
[26:57] things to him because it was
[27:00] Intelligence parts of him that was
[27:02] working well you and
[27:05] I you and I can have within our human
[27:11] intelligence understanding doctrines um
[27:14] whatever you want to call it we can
[27:16] still have denominational
[27:19] ideas we'll get back to a minute on it
[27:21] see yep but these these 144,000 they
[27:25] don't have any right well we better be
[27:28] that way or there's not going to be over
[27:31] there right right it's all it's all
[27:35] based on whether or not we can come to a
[27:37] place Amen to be virgins in our
[27:40] understanding amen and you say well
[27:42] brother Dale how do we get rid of you
[27:44] got to first know you got
[27:46] it
[27:48] amen we we used to be in the I always
[27:51] have told you believed in one God but I
[27:54] explained it as God in three persons
[27:56] Blessed Trinity cuz I didn't know any
[27:57] other way to explain it right all right
[28:00] and see you can still be that today and
[28:03] then you see all these doctrines of the
[28:05] message that comes in of those
[28:07] 200,000,000 demons that is loosed on the
[28:10] bride of Christ that's right to drive
[28:12] her to the message of hour
[28:14] amen you say well you mean God like I
[28:17] tried to explain it the other day you
[28:18] know how those Jews being killed by the
[28:20] millions but that was God's tender hand
[28:22] that's right carrying him to the home
[28:24] right amen that's right amen why don't
[28:27] we count the heartaches and trials and
[28:29] Troubles of life as to be
[28:32] a an
[28:36] opportunity that God can use that to
[28:40] bring us to a place of you know
[28:43] submission or whatever we need right
[28:45] amen and all like that see why why can't
[28:48] we keep that in mind instead of trying
[28:50] to get everything so much that we're so
[28:52] great and we're so
[28:54] revelated you know what we're doing is
[28:57] just wait on y'all yeah you know well
[29:01] then everybody here gets the idea well
[29:03] we're just waiting on them out there
[29:04] that's on the internet system you know
[29:06] so we waiting on
[29:10] y'all it might be you and
[29:13] I that has the problem they might be
[29:16] waiting on you and I well I don't know
[29:19] about that brother Dale that be little
[29:20] in me well then you get your high down
[29:24] you know the turkeys you know they they
[29:26] say turkeys will just stand and look
[29:27] right straight up in the sky and drown
[29:30] you know little baby ones and they'll
[29:33] just stand there and it raining like
[29:34] everything and they'll just drown you
[29:36] know well maybe sometimes we need to get
[29:39] our head out of the sky get it back down
[29:41] on Earth and and you know tuck it under
[29:43] our wings and keep being drowned by our
[29:46] own thoughts and ideas okay but now
[29:50] listen we know that this is the same
[29:53] people of Revelations 14 as Revelation 7
[29:56] but as I said revelation 7even is
[29:58] showing more or less the Earthly Journey
[30:01] the uh uh the bringing in of those and
[30:06] and then when you get into this
[30:07] Revelations 14 you're going to find Dan
[30:09] and Ephraim put back in and that's kind
[30:12] of a hard situation I tried to explain
[30:14] it for about 40 something years that
[30:18] what are you going to do with that other
[30:20] 24,000 you know cuz you got 24,000 more
[30:24] if you add Dan and Ephraim back in and
[30:26] you take Joseph and Levi out you're not
[30:28] going to take them out and leave them
[30:29] here
[30:30] right that's not the point is not to do
[30:34] that so we found then that and when we
[30:36] get there to the Millennium that Israel
[30:39] as is going to be Israel as a nation
[30:41] right so there could be a lot of Jews in
[30:43] the Millennium sure with Israel as a
[30:46] nation right that they can do we're
[30:48] going to be there on a honeymoon right
[30:50] amen and we'll have an escort not that
[30:53] we need
[30:54] protection but it's just part of the
[30:57] plan that the way that God designed it
[30:59] to be you know and it's going to be a
[31:01] wonderful time as I said a moment ago
[31:03] then we read this and say well the first
[31:06] fruit so we try to make that bride these
[31:08] are not bride right but you know they
[31:11] are first fruits
[31:12] right now you know why because they have
[31:15] eternal life that's right exactly
[31:17] because they receive eternal life here
[31:19] right amen see first fruits is bride yes
[31:22] that's eternal life but remember these
[31:25] 144,000 plus the two witness they
[31:26] receive eternal life here right amen all
[31:29] right so then there will be first fruits
[31:32] and they will follow the lamb whether
[31:33] soever he go but you know who's going to
[31:35] be with the lamb wherever he goes amen
[31:38] that's right the bride of Christ so it's
[31:40] going to be wonderful situation all
[31:43] right and they have the seal in their
[31:47] forehead the Seal of god so let's just
[31:50] take a few things and read now of what
[31:52] the prophet has said let's go ahead on
[31:54] down to number uh two brother
[31:59] I had these Wednesday and I didn't get
[32:01] down to them so I said we'll just
[32:02] continue this thought on Brother
[32:05] Anderson remember I'm Brother Anderson
[32:08] okay that's Joe Anderson back there
[32:11] anyway Anderson Joe eitherway want make
[32:15] it this is taken from the 10 virgins and
[32:18] 144,000 of the Jews you all right which
[32:21] preached in 1960 121 the morning
[32:24] service now that's the Seal of God we
[32:27] know that and remember there's only
[32:30] 144,000 of the Jews sealed right which
[32:33] was the remnant yep of the Jews left
[32:37] over all right see the remnant in the
[32:40] end time all right now but this but in
[32:44] this in the Gentile bride in the Gentile
[32:46] bride there was tens of thousands and
[32:48] thousand those that sealed in there
[32:51] because that's them Martyrs and things
[32:53] that come down Through the Ages there
[32:54] and they rise in the day of judgment but
[32:57] the Jew is the remnant of the Jews
[32:59] that's left
[33:00] over all right you know the remnant is
[33:04] the material you lay the pattern down
[33:06] you cut it out you make a dress there's
[33:08] the bride what's left around it there's
[33:11] right the right the material so in the
[33:15] bride so you lay it down and you you cut
[33:17] out the remnant and you got a foolish
[33:19] virgin left over Amen in Israel you take
[33:21] it and you lay down the people right and
[33:24] you got a Remnant to be done in the last
[33:26] days of the 144 th000 all right go ahead
[33:29] on up to number three this is taken from
[33:32] the Seal of Christ of the Christ
[33:36] 1955 uh
[33:37] 3:12 say the angels of God with
[33:41] destroying weapons coming forth to
[33:42] destroy the world and what did the Holy
[33:45] Spirit say hold the Four Winds hold the
[33:48] world war until the winds Means War all
[33:52] right okay see the same thing as woes
[33:55] all
[33:56] right this is This Global destruction
[33:59] hold it until we have sealed the
[34:01] Servants of our God in their forehead
[34:03] that's right the Gentile never was a
[34:05] servant right the Jews a servant Y and
[34:08] John recognized them every one of them
[34:10] 144,000 of the Jews it was Abraham my
[34:14] servant right thank you don't go back
[34:17] there and say Abraham my my
[34:21] son you see Abraham was a servant CU in
[34:24] the Old Testament they did not have
[34:26] eternal life in the the body of Christ
[34:29] amen that's right that wouldn't deal in
[34:33] the Old Testament until Jesus Christ
[34:34] would come right and bring eternal life
[34:37] then they could receive eternal life and
[34:39] then I said like the remnant see then
[34:41] you got the remnant part of Israel in
[34:43] the fact that Mary John Peter all of
[34:47] them Jews came into the New Testament
[34:50] right and that would be the
[34:53] remnant because it was only a small
[34:55] amount of people right and remnant of
[34:57] the Old Testament would come in and
[34:59] receive eternal life and be in the
[35:02] bride but to Israel as a whole they
[35:05] rejected that right these 144,000 reject
[35:08] that right right you know by uh how did
[35:12] you what you say the rep by
[35:14] representation of predestination because
[35:16] of what happened back there in in the
[35:18] time of Jesus Christ then that put all
[35:21] the Jews in that position see a man can
[35:23] stand day I never turned down
[35:26] Jesus why you accept him now then you
[35:28] won't quro like that you know you'll
[35:31] quit croaking about right the problem
[35:33] you accept Jesus Christ now and you'll
[35:35] see what happen that's right now you
[35:37] won't be blaming somebody else you'll
[35:39] see you're the fault I don't blame the
[35:41] Jews for Killing Jesus I don't blame the
[35:43] Romans for Killing Jesus cuz none of
[35:46] them killed him n it was my sin
[35:49] amen my sins is what hung him on a tree
[35:52] see not nothing like that all right now
[35:55] go on to number four
[35:59] a lot of this you'll find is from the
[36:01] Seal of God or the mark of the beast and
[36:03] thing so you can go back to that the
[36:04] Seal of God preach 54
[36:08] 5:15 now watch they can't do it in other
[36:11] words you can't have the atomic bombs
[36:14] falling the the wars the things see you
[36:17] got to spatial Wars and we will try to
[36:20] do a little more of that this evening I
[36:22] guess on the message but see it can't be
[36:25] done in other words you can't bring on
[36:26] an atomic destruction in the United
[36:28] States and things right now that's
[36:31] supposed to be after we get out of here
[36:33] all right now see they can't do it until
[36:36] the Jews get a visitation of the baptism
[36:38] of the Holy Ghost right right now see
[36:41] they get a visitation of the baptism of
[36:44] the Holy Ghost that's right but it
[36:45] doesn't make them Sons and Daughters
[36:49] right and you know they're not going to
[36:51] be who are you I'm a Son of God who are
[36:55] you
[36:57] I'm a servant I don't like to be a
[36:59] servant n they're going to be tickle to
[37:01] death so is every Jew that winds up in
[37:03] the Millennium going be tickle to death
[37:05] be right right
[37:08] okay the angel said hold it right till
[37:11] we seal the servants not the Bri the
[37:14] Gentiles never was a servant we are Sons
[37:17] and Daughters of God that's the servants
[37:19] the Jews Abraham was God's servant he
[37:21] said Hallelujah right all right going on
[37:24] to the next then we'll begin to pick up
[37:27] some of the these things that what
[37:28] they're going to be
[37:29] called this is very familiar with us
[37:32] paragraph or page 41 of the church age
[37:34] book revelation of Jesus
[37:37] Christ now these 144,000 are not in the
[37:41] bride in Revelations 144 they are called
[37:44] virgins and they follow the lamb whether
[37:47] soever he goeth the fact that they have
[37:49] not defiled themselves with women shows
[37:51] that they are
[37:55] Unix now not because of a
[37:59] ceration you know an operation right
[38:03] we'll get to that in a minute he can
[38:04] read what brother R says that that was a
[38:06] custom that they done right we'll do it
[38:09] cuz I like to cover the whole
[38:11] thing but see according to rev Matthew
[38:14] we'll get to that in a minute 1912 see
[38:16] some are made Unix and some of this but
[38:18] some are Unix for the kingdom we'll read
[38:20] that in just a
[38:21] minute the Unix were the keepers of the
[38:23] bridal
[38:24] Chambers they were attendants no notice
[38:27] that they do not sit in the throne but
[38:30] are Before the Throne no they are not in
[38:34] the bride will but will be in the
[38:36] Glorious Millennial Reign right we then
[38:39] see we we read that one but leave this
[38:42] one out most of the time we then see
[38:45] that when these light of Israel have
[38:48] joined in love to the Lord and the enemy
[38:50] has been destroyed God will prepare His
[38:52] Holy Mountain his new Garden of Eden for
[38:56] the bride and his her
[38:58] attendance for the Thousand Years
[39:00] honeymoon upon the Earth as Adam and Eve
[39:03] were in the garden and did not finish
[39:07] out the Thousand Years now Jesus and
[39:11] Jesus our life Adam and his Eve true
[39:15] church will fulfill all the plan of God
[39:19] Amen all right well what are they going
[39:21] to
[39:26] be all right where where we
[39:32] at go ahead with number six oh we'll see
[39:35] what he what the scripture said about
[39:37] Unix for there are some Unix Matthew
[39:42] 1912 which were so born from their
[39:45] mother's womb that's
[39:47] normal and there are some Unix which
[39:50] were made Unix of men y you
[39:53] know they were castrated made Unix
[39:58] and there be
[40:00] Unix which have made themselves Unix for
[40:03] the kingdom of Heaven's Sake he that is
[40:06] able to receive it let him receive it
[40:08] amen if you can receive it then receive
[40:11] it listen to it some make themselves
[40:14] Unix some are made Unix by man and some
[40:18] people are born sterile as we call it
[40:21] not necessarily curated but get born
[40:25] sterile just to be plain we somebody out
[40:27] there won't argue with us over the
[40:29] wording but now
[40:31] listen our thoughts of
[40:33] Unix is something like that A Sterile
[40:38] person and they did have them that were
[40:43] guards are taking care of the queen you
[40:47] know and all of the Kings and they would
[40:49] have servants and things like that and
[40:52] they would naturally make them
[40:55] sterile because they didn't want them
[40:57] their wives you know all
[40:59] right but that's not true in every
[41:03] case CU like I said about Joseph see we
[41:06] called him a servant he was sold he was
[41:07] a servant to
[41:09] Piper and Piper's wife's trying to get
[41:12] him to go lay with
[41:15] her and sure proved he wasn't sterile
[41:18] that's right all and then you know he
[41:22] winds up and has at least two kids right
[41:25] so you know they would
[41:28] it ain't always that way it's what
[41:31] you're using the word unit
[41:33] for if you're using it for the natural
[41:36] things you deal up here but you're
[41:38] dealing with the spiritual part I'm
[41:41] going to go ahead and say it in case I
[41:42] don't get back to it ever born again
[41:44] believer in the body of Christ ought to
[41:46] consider themselves to be a unic
[41:49] right right we're not talking about
[41:51] natural
[41:52] things we're supposed to have one
[41:55] husband
[41:57] right we're supposed to be virgins right
[42:01] we're supposed to be
[42:03] servants the bride of Christ what's the
[42:09] problem Jesus not don't people would
[42:13] want you to use that word and they're
[42:14] using it word now to make him this that
[42:16] of there but you know he set himself
[42:18] aside for the Kingdom's sake right he
[42:22] was a unic he never touched women Paul
[42:25] was a unic read the scripture in a
[42:28] minute see well why can't we consider
[42:31] ourselves to be that we're supposed to
[42:34] have one husband we're supposed to be
[42:35] married to Christ we're not supposed to
[42:37] be out running around with all other
[42:40] things you say well Unix on men this men
[42:44] well where'd you get that idea
[42:47] from I thought women were supposed to be
[42:50] Unix
[42:53] too I don't like you use word unic about
[42:56] me well get what I'm talking about if
[43:00] you're a born again believer you're
[43:01] supposed to be all of these things set
[43:03] aside for the
[43:05] kingdom and to be married to Jesus
[43:11] Christ see they get away from the ideas
[43:14] of always just Unix is
[43:18] this that gets away from just the
[43:20] natural points of
[43:22] man all right go ahead to number six
[43:25] this is taken some questions and answers
[43:27] on Hebrews book 1 57
[43:31] 925 you notice over in Revelations there
[43:35] it said and they are virgins they are
[43:38] Unix now what was a unit now watch him
[43:41] give the definition but watch him
[43:42] explain it they were Unix were the
[43:45] temple guards that guarded the queen
[43:47] they were they were men that were made
[43:50] sterile he knows
[43:53] that but
[43:55] now is he talking about stir from here
[43:59] on what is he saying they did you notice
[44:02] that they had not defiled themselves
[44:04] with
[44:07] women that's why they're virgins right
[44:11] and that's why they're
[44:13] sterile they're Unix right they not
[44:16] defile
[44:19] themselves not that they got to
[44:22] be I use that word too much h
[44:27] see we get up all in our mind we oh we
[44:29] got that figured
[44:31] out
[44:32] well then you turn around like Paul and
[44:36] Paul said well I had a right to get
[44:38] married if I wanted to I won't do it
[44:42] well see then you come up with the idea
[44:43] like someone said well he was a member
[44:45] of the
[44:46] Sanhedrin so he had to be married well
[44:49] no
[44:51] no and Jesus certainly wasn't that right
[44:55] I remember some brothers one time and
[44:57] that told us or had this against this
[44:59] other this brother y that he couldn't be
[45:02] a pastor of a church because he wasn't
[45:04] married and I told him I said well Paul
[45:06] wasn't married Jesus wasn't married what
[45:09] are you going to
[45:12] do that brother R said a deacon don't
[45:15] make a deacon out of somebody that's
[45:17] single right he said they ought to be
[45:19] married where they will know how to rule
[45:23] the house of God right amen all right
[45:27] what do you see what I'm talking about
[45:28] yes
[45:29] see they were they were men that were
[45:33] made sterile H he's only typing it see
[45:37] and they did you notice that they had
[45:40] not defiled themselves with women they
[45:42] were Temple Unix and it was a selected
[45:44] number that God has taken out of the
[45:47] elect of the
[45:49] Jews a special people taken out of the
[45:53] very elect of
[45:55] Israel now if you'll notice if we could
[45:57] just get that just a moment so it's kind
[45:59] of settled in your mind where you can
[46:02] really
[46:03] H I think about it look at the next one
[46:07] this is paragraph that was paragraph 39
[46:09] this is paragraph 74 of the same
[46:13] message watch of course I know you go
[46:15] back over here to the 14th you talking
[46:17] about Revelation
[46:19] 14 why they're with the bride whereever
[46:23] they absolutely Unix travel the unic
[46:27] travel with the queen wherever she went
[46:30] truly but what were they they were
[46:33] nothing but
[46:34] escorts and just exact that's just
[46:36] exactly what the Scripture decires it to
[46:38] be here right escorts
[46:42] right guiding it I mean you think we're
[46:45] going to get over and and I make things
[46:48] natural where nobody won't run off of
[46:50] the wrong thing and you think I'm too
[46:52] carnal but you think we're going to get
[46:54] over in the Millennium and worrying
[46:56] about somebody running around with
[46:57] somebody's
[47:01] wife right talking to a lady one day you
[47:04] know we talking about we get over there
[47:06] we be in a brand new body boy she
[47:10] just I mean you in the house she not to
[47:12] tell you to read her
[47:14] mind he's thinking about getting that
[47:17] slender body back you think we're going
[47:20] to have trouble in the Millennium we not
[47:22] have trouble
[47:24] now right
[47:27] amen watch as these Jews As We Lay It
[47:29] Down
[47:31] they're virgins they don't take no
[47:34] denominational
[47:36] do not dealing with whether or not
[47:39] they pure in body as you call
[47:42] it he talking about what they are in
[47:48] God look what Paul has to say about
[47:52] it in 1 Corinthians
[47:55] 7:7 I would that all men were even as I
[47:58] myself but every man ha his proper gift
[48:00] of God yep one after this man and
[48:04] another after
[48:06] that now if you back up read up and down
[48:08] you'll find he's talking about he's
[48:10] talking about a
[48:12] virginity and you know men have a
[48:15] virginity as well as a woman has a
[48:19] virginity right that's why Paul will say
[48:23] if it's given it's no
[48:25] problem but it's better to
[48:28] hold men are supposed to be virgin we're
[48:30] not supposed to be the HCHO muncho run
[48:32] around all the women you want to but
[48:34] we're clean that's what my mom used to
[48:35] say she said a man can go out and live
[48:37] with all the women he wants to put a
[48:38] suit on he goes to church he call
[48:41] brother he said woman go have one act
[48:43] say she classifi an adulter all the rest
[48:46] of her
[48:47] life cuz
[48:49] that's that don't work in the kingdom of
[48:52] God come on look what Paul said I say
[48:56] therefore to the unmarried and widows it
[48:59] is good for them if they abide even as
[49:03] I and we'll read where Pro the prophet
[49:06] said that Paul wasn't
[49:09] married but if they cannot contain let
[49:12] them marry first better to marry than to
[49:14] burn that's why he say all can't receive
[49:17] it in his writings he's talking
[49:22] about what up above down below what do
[49:25] you read
[49:28] because a a wife is concerned about her
[49:30] husband and fulfilling the things of
[49:32] Duty of a wife of a husband is talking
[49:35] about wife fulfilling the duties of a
[49:37] husband and but see if you don't have a
[49:40] husband or a wife you can totally commit
[49:43] everything to
[49:45] God and see we always look at something
[49:48] you know we really you know somebody
[49:50] comes along doesn't want to get married
[49:51] and we think he must be feminist
[49:59] then a girl comes up don't want
[50:01] Mar she done something
[50:03] wrong she's done something
[50:06] wrong because she don't want to get
[50:09] married and let it be
[50:11] revealed now come on folks is that
[50:15] right they're trying to do their best
[50:18] for God to give their life to
[50:21] him but some can't some can't do that so
[50:25] it's better to marry than to Burning
[50:26] Love
[50:28] us so get
[50:30] married going be a bad world if some of
[50:33] us had
[50:34] got that's right I'm the baby of 13 I'm
[50:37] sure glad they didn't
[50:41] stop I wasn't a guy
[50:44] here but listen
[50:48] folks see you could be a unic for the
[50:53] gospel you can set yourself aside but
[50:56] once you married you got qualification
[50:59] right see some of the women come along
[51:01] and say okay brother Dale he's preaching
[51:03] we to be Unix TR I
[51:06] this remove myself from my
[51:11] husband you ain't you you got mental
[51:14] problems let alone anything else that's
[51:17] right the Bible says that even for a
[51:20] man to not fast unless he gets consent
[51:26] for his from his wife right CU lest he
[51:30] be tempted or she be tempted for his
[51:33] inconsistency do we need to explain
[51:37] that
[51:39] amen see the Bible's
[51:42] plain if you get married you're
[51:45] married amen well I'll just pull away
[51:48] I'll divorce my husband I'll divorce my
[51:50] wife now this become a unit no you're
[51:52] not doing it you already got a woman
[51:54] picked out or a man picked out don't
[51:57] talk to me too old you're already in
[52:00] your
[52:01] mind looking
[52:03] around you're trying to figure out some
[52:05] way to get it set up to where you can
[52:07] get married
[52:08] again well I've always said one thing
[52:12] you you marry one and and you get
[52:14] married again you just got two problems
[52:17] that's amen you say problems we're
[52:20] husband and wife cuz we have to live for
[52:22] God
[52:24] right brother told me one time he said
[52:26] so was going to have problems to get
[52:28] married I said everybody that gets
[52:29] married got
[52:32] problems you tell me me and my wife all
[52:35] of our Liv live together and never had
[52:36] an
[52:39] argument I don't like to call people
[52:43] Liars all
[52:45] right there's one thing for certain has
[52:47] happened either she's so submissive and
[52:49] so beat down but don't worry about it
[52:51] she sneak around the Y that's what
[52:53] sister barbar used to tell me how those
[52:55] Islamic women said they were under
[52:57] subjection I said they
[52:59] women I said you remember when y'all
[53:00] sitting around talking she started
[53:04] grinning
[53:06] you they just kept under
[53:10] subjection but listen folks I'm just
[53:12] trying to explain something trying to
[53:15] explain a
[53:17] unic but I want to be a unic for the
[53:19] Gospel of Jesus Christ cuz I don't want
[53:22] no more doctrin I want to be a virgin
[53:24] cuz I don't want no Doctrine
[53:29] I might not qualify
[53:31] naturally in human
[53:34] life but I can qualify in the
[53:40] kingdom and that way then you can be
[53:42] what God wants you to be
[53:46] right see but the husband and wife ought
[53:49] to be to the Bas that there you know
[53:51] there to be uh what you call it I'm not
[53:55] sympathetic that's the wrong word
[53:57] like I said a while ago you know about
[53:59] bad for being married and all I wouldn't
[54:00] throw anything against my wife's the
[54:02] greatest woman in the
[54:04] world and she tell you he's the greatest
[54:07] guy in the world but we we don't live
[54:09] we're not goody goody two shoes all over
[54:11] our lives either we've had our arguments
[54:13] and fusses and all like that but we get
[54:15] over
[54:16] it we just don't go around tell
[54:18] everybody else right right everybody
[54:22] else wants to go cry on somebody's
[54:23] shoulder you and my having problems what
[54:26] kind of problem well he told me that
[54:28] that that I didn't cook
[54:32] good my
[54:35] goodness go cook
[54:41] his what we call that
[54:44] problem brother Ernie was talking about
[54:47] you know brother Ernest was talking
[54:49] about brother around telling those women
[54:52] said that woman you know standing there
[54:53] said you come to be prayed for he said
[54:55] you're just going through to change of
[54:57] life right he said if I ask her to raise
[55:00] a hand said a lot of these women out
[55:02] here be going through to change of life
[55:05] well he wasn't going to quit and not
[55:07] pray for
[55:08] her but it was a normal part of life y
[55:12] man and woman live together long enough
[55:14] they're going to get in an
[55:15] argument they're going to have problems
[55:18] that's
[55:19] right but I've always told you my
[55:22] philosophy right oh
[55:24] yeah never go to
[55:27] B without saying I love
[55:34] you some of you men maybe go home you
[55:37] know and say well honey I don't tell you

[55:50] today no you're done been telling her
[55:52] all these years you love
[55:57] am it's a lot to be a
[55:59] Christian but to be two people and be a
[56:03] Christian right amen it's hard to be mad
[56:06] at somebody if they say I love you
[56:07] that's right you know you try it some
[56:10] sometimes right in the middle of a big
[56:11] argument just stop and say hey I love
[56:17] you don't talk to me like that what was
[56:19] it Gil when Nick asked her something
[56:22] coming up the road one day and she said
[56:24] he had to ask me on the way to the
[56:25] church asked me how much I owed on my
[56:27] credit card how much you ow on no credit
[56:29] card had to ask me on the way to the
[56:34] church I you wasn't meaning that wrong
[56:37] it's just a point I was laughing the
[56:39] other day these people I went to visit
[56:42] that we hunt with and the lady she said
[56:45] well they over here at these churches
[56:46] now said they just said they just go to
[56:48] church wear anything don't they I said
[56:50] yeah she said oh where we going other
[56:52] things to they just wear shorts and they
[56:54] wear pants
[56:56] well looking over that she was s there
[56:58] with pants on but see she she still had
[57:01] that she said you don't go to church
[57:03] wearing pants well see that was
[57:05] honorable you you'd laugh at her said
[57:08] what she sitting there with a home but
[57:10] that's
[57:11] honorable you know it's honorable right
[57:14] to go to church dress decent where
[57:17] brother R said your
[57:18] best be decent and
[57:21] everything and be honorable
[57:24] amen but we don't believe in doing
[57:26] something at home any different than
[57:27] what we do at church but still it was
[57:29] honorable for her to say that right see
[57:32] Church there's some good people in this
[57:34] world old fell come out and he said just
[57:36] keep right on
[57:38] pray I'm like we drug him out of the
[57:40] woods twice and ID up in ront end of a
[57:42] tractor and him already gone just about
[57:44] it I was going roll back his head one
[57:47] time and we pray for him he still tells
[57:50] everybody about it that's right you know
[57:53] but listen
[57:55] Church Paul was
[57:59] explaining a life a Christian
[58:03] Life that's it if you can not have no
[58:08] problems just don't get
[58:10] married you you don't have to get in
[58:13] this message now years ago it's not as
[58:15] bad now but some of you older ones that
[58:18] was around in the early early
[58:21] 60s like we were 68 right in there 60
[58:24] 768 said 70s if a girl wasn't married by
[58:28] the time she was 16 and had three babies
[58:30] time she was 20 she would something
[58:32] wrong with
[58:33] her that's right that's just the
[58:36] truth everybody was supposed to get
[58:38] married well we happened to be at these
[58:39] people's Place one
[58:41] time and uh GGY said something to the
[58:44] lady and I don't know where it was my
[58:46] conversation to her of one but she wound
[58:48] up saying to the lady you know said we
[58:49] don't believe in forcing you know
[58:51] pushing people to get married young she
[58:53] said but we do
[58:57] you know something to that degree but
[58:59] listen
[59:00] Church a unic is not one that has to
[59:04] be no seed there
[59:08] sterl it can be one set aside for the
[59:11] kingdom of
[59:13] God it can be one set aside for certain
[59:16] things some people just don't want to
[59:19] marry
[59:21] right now lot that they're married just
[59:23] look at them and think they're funny
[59:24] yeah but you know what they look at us
[59:26] and say they're
[59:28] funny so who's
[59:32] funny cuz there's a lot of people that
[59:34] don't want to get married well are you
[59:37] going to force them to no no because
[59:41] they can give their life to God Lord
[59:44] that's
[59:45] right I I wasn't made for that my wife
[59:47] used to tell me years ago said you need
[59:49] to you needed to stay single I said but
[59:51] I'm not made for
[59:52] that you notice when you come up them
[59:55] steps out there my office door is never
[59:58] closed if it is I'm in there asleep
[1:00:00] don't knock
[1:00:03] yeah door's closed on sleep that's
[1:00:08] right but you see at home you know the
[1:00:11] kids would be there with way my old
[1:00:12] study was right there beside the den she
[1:00:15] said we're hindering you well it didn't
[1:00:17] hinder me the kids come in and say Daddy
[1:00:19] can we go do something I said yeah I'll
[1:00:21] go ahead and do it you said well I ain't
[1:00:23] going to let my kids get to my study
[1:00:24] while I'm studying
[1:00:27] well okay I got no problems with you
[1:00:30] that's you I just made with an open
[1:00:34] door and I never was made to live alone
[1:00:37] that's right
[1:00:40] amen you remember the old Dallas movie
[1:00:43] where all the family lived in one
[1:00:45] house well I'd be satisfied if we had a
[1:00:48] big enough house whether could everybody
[1:00:50] have their part of the house and be
[1:00:52] welcome to stay
[1:00:54] there cuz that's just the way I
[1:00:56] am you all right but you're not that
[1:01:01] way well see that just for me that's
[1:01:03] just my way of being I can sit down in
[1:01:04] the study and one of the grandkids can
[1:01:06] come in there and just sit down right
[1:01:07] there and play and I can just be W notes
[1:01:09] and study and you know I no problem
[1:01:12] that's right cuz that's the way I'm
[1:01:15] made but everybody's not made that way I
[1:01:18] understand that everybody's not made to
[1:01:20] be set aside for certain things right
[1:01:23] and all but don't call all Unix right
[1:01:27] things right they got a pretty good
[1:01:29] position amen like I said you say well
[1:01:32] you got to have a you you you emphasize
[1:01:34] that you know the seed comes through the
[1:01:36] body and that's emphasized you know by
[1:01:38] people and the scripture the prophet
[1:01:41] saying the seed comes through the body
[1:01:42] see somebody carrying the seed down they
[1:01:44] had to be in the body to carry it down
[1:01:45] that's wonderful we know that's true
[1:01:47] right uh but if you got to have a seed
[1:01:49] to be able to carry that gospel you got
[1:01:52] a problem with Ethiopian unit that's
[1:01:54] right amen it went down Ethiopia and
[1:01:56] converted all that country right amen
[1:01:59] you had a problem there amen he was
[1:02:02] probably physically a unic MH sure but
[1:02:05] you know what he was too you check back
[1:02:07] and see if you'll find out he was the
[1:02:09] treasurer
[1:02:11] MH that's what he had done he had went
[1:02:13] up there to pay ties and do different
[1:02:16] things he was a
[1:02:18] Treasurer that was his
[1:02:22] job I even read up on a lot of things
[1:02:24] you studied a lot of things it and go on
[1:02:26] your computer and read it and you find
[1:02:28] out that that some of your um best opera
[1:02:33] singers are
[1:02:35] Unix because they actually make them
[1:02:38] Unix at a certain age the word you know
[1:02:41] how you you you remember how you were a
[1:02:42] kid I'm talking about do this but then
[1:02:44] you read a lot in there that you don't
[1:02:45] have to it ain't talking about being
[1:02:47] sterile either you know read a whole lot
[1:02:49] of it read it but you know how a kid
[1:02:51] when he comes along you know when you
[1:02:53] you say something when you kids he oh
[1:02:57] you
[1:02:59] know you know girls don't go through
[1:03:03] that boys do yeah but see then they do
[1:03:06] that and they make them
[1:03:08] Unix that pitch or that voice when they
[1:03:10] come up in their age they can sing opera
[1:03:13] that's right to the greatest read it up
[1:03:15] I when I get something a thought I look
[1:03:17] it up but also found that you don't have
[1:03:20] to be you know sterile to be called a
[1:03:23] unic right
[1:03:27] see it it's maybe your choice of what
[1:03:30] you want right but in the Kingdom we're
[1:03:32] to all consider ourselves to be
[1:03:35] right not wanting any other seed right
[1:03:39] from any other form and make ourselves
[1:03:42] Sons and Daughters of a living
[1:03:45] God these 144,000 are called virgins the
[1:03:49] prophets because they did not defile
[1:03:51] themselves with women right not meaning
[1:03:53] physically no that's right he didn't
[1:03:55] mean they couldn't have no
[1:03:57] children it doesn't mean they're not
[1:03:59] married right right come on but it means
[1:04:03] that they have set themselves aside when
[1:04:05] they heard the gosp when they hear the
[1:04:07] gospel of those two witnesses they will
[1:04:10] get away from all organized religion it
[1:04:12] be old mother hord or heart daughters or
[1:04:15] whoever it is they're going to get away
[1:04:17] from it
[1:04:18] righten why because they're setting
[1:04:21] thems aside right
[1:04:24] y they come to a great thing a great
[1:04:27] position that's right as we read there a
[1:04:29] moment ago about the prophet saying that
[1:04:30] they were
[1:04:32] chosen let's read these fights and then
[1:04:34] I got a few comments I want to make on
[1:04:36] something that might be interested in
[1:04:38] the
[1:04:40] scriptures brother around says on
[1:04:42] questions and answers on Genesis 53 729
[1:04:45] number 10 on your notes Brother Anderson
[1:04:49] he's talking about
[1:04:52] Paul Paul said now here I know I preach
[1:04:56] the
[1:04:57] gospel that's my duty I'm a preacher
[1:05:00] he's a Preacher Brother Neville is a
[1:05:02] preacher but it that's our duties to be
[1:05:05] a preacher well that's just what we're
[1:05:07] supposed to do but let me do something
[1:05:11] Paul said that's beyond that now I got a
[1:05:14] right to take up money Paul said now
[1:05:18] he's
[1:05:19] explaining life right
[1:05:22] all but I'm going to make tense just to
[1:05:26] show you I can sacrifice he said it's
[1:05:29] honorable marriage is Honorable among
[1:05:31] all the bed's undefiled it's good for a
[1:05:34] man to be married he said I got a right
[1:05:38] to be married now I could be married I
[1:05:41] got a legal right to be married but it
[1:05:43] just won't get married I want to do
[1:05:46] another service to the Lord see then he
[1:05:48] said every man knows his calling let him
[1:05:51] do as SS Unix for the word of God's sake
[1:05:56] Y and so
[1:05:57] forth we want to do something beyond our
[1:06:00] duty now listen to us right if you
[1:06:03] really if you're really born again of
[1:06:06] the spirit of God and say that's my duty
[1:06:09] to go to

[1:06:59] 805 paragraph
[1:07:02] e49 Dove and lamb while you're listening
[1:07:06] the most while you're listening the most
[1:07:09] outstanding scriptures one of them that
[1:07:12] I can think of when Jesus said father
[1:07:15] think of it father for their sake I
[1:07:18] sanctify myself greatest scripture he
[1:07:20] could think of right think of it father
[1:07:23] for their sake I sanctify myself what
[1:07:26] was he doing setting the example he was
[1:07:29] a lamb what did he do he had a right to
[1:07:31] a home he was a
[1:07:34] man he had a right to be married he was
[1:07:37] a man now you understand what he's
[1:07:38] saying you want to quote where brother R
[1:07:40] said Jesus was even tempted of women but
[1:07:43] he didn't yield to it okay that's right
[1:07:46] he had a right to be married he was a
[1:07:47] man he had a right to good clothes he
[1:07:50] was a man but he Sanctified himself he
[1:07:53] forfeited it he he could have he could
[1:07:56] have come down the corridors of Glory a
[1:07:59] full statured man with an Angelic band
[1:08:02] sure but he Sanctified
[1:08:05] himself he could have at least been born
[1:08:08] in a nice clean bed somewhere but he was
[1:08:12] born in a manger over a man Pile in a
[1:08:16] bar manger but he Sanctified himself why
[1:08:20] he was the lamb see friends we got to to
[1:08:23] back we got to back to a assembly
[1:08:26] assembly line religions and so forth
[1:08:30] that's where we got to right and all of
[1:08:32] these things that we're getting away
[1:08:34] from the real things humble yourself
[1:08:37] keep humble Lord sanctify me look the
[1:08:40] last
[1:08:41] one taken from and thy seed shall
[1:08:44] possess the Gate of the enemies preached
[1:08:45] in
[1:08:46] 1961 to 12 the evening service paragraph
[1:08:51] e51 he possess every gate of Temptation
[1:08:54] oh how he did he was a man he was a man
[1:08:57] like you are like I am he had a right to
[1:09:00] be married he had a right to have a home
[1:09:02] he had a right to the things that we
[1:09:04] have he had right to have clothes he
[1:09:06] could have done it a man that could turn
[1:09:09] water into wine that could know where a
[1:09:12] coin was in a fish's mouth while he
[1:09:14] owned the heavens and earth but yet he
[1:09:16] abstained from those things the sweetest
[1:09:19] words in the Bible when he when he said
[1:09:22] father I sanctify myself that I might
[1:09:24] sanctify them him what was he trying to
[1:09:27] do set an example he was sending 12 men
[1:09:31] out with a gospel that would conquer the
[1:09:33] world and he's depending on you and and
[1:09:36] I to do it if he could sanctify himself
[1:09:39] like that why ought we why ought we to
[1:09:43] set aside every failure and every doubt
[1:09:47] and everything else and sanctify
[1:09:49] ourselves for We Are The Seed of Abraham
[1:09:52] through him that are more than
[1:09:57] conquerors through him yes he had a
[1:10:00] right to be married he had a right to
[1:10:02] have a home he had a right to lay his
[1:10:04] head on a pillow
[1:10:06] but the foxes have BS and the birds have
[1:10:10] nest and the son of man don't have a
[1:10:12] place to lay his head why I sanctify
[1:10:15] myself father for their sake I do it for
[1:10:18] their sake not because he had to but for
[1:10:22] their sake he conquered every enemy
[1:10:25] that's for you and
[1:10:26] I he set himself
[1:10:30] aside see ought it to be that we are to
[1:10:32] be set herself
[1:10:34] aside to be a unit for
[1:10:38] God you know to be set aside to the
[1:10:41] bases that we we wouldn't
[1:10:46] uh wind up in the wrong
[1:10:49] way all right pull up
[1:10:53] number 11 I just want you to of
[1:10:55] scripture this may not what you would
[1:10:57] say this is applied to the what we're
[1:10:59] talking about but let's see if it does
[1:11:01] look look number 11 brother Isaiah 56
[1:11:04] and
[1:11:07] 3 Let's see what God thinks of
[1:11:12] Unix not talking
[1:11:15] of ster or not
[1:11:19] Unix neither let the son of the stranger
[1:11:23] that have joined himself to the Lord Isa
[1:11:25] F 56
[1:11:26] 3-5 speak saying the Lord ha utterly
[1:11:30] separated me from his people neither let
[1:11:32] the unic say behold I am a dry tree
[1:11:37] right don't let him say it for thus
[1:11:40] sayith the Lord unto the Unix that keep
[1:11:43] my
[1:11:44] sabbaths in other words that follow the
[1:11:46] word do what the word says right and
[1:11:49] choose the things that please
[1:11:52] me and take hold of my Covenant
[1:11:56] there's the kind I want to
[1:11:57] be right even unto
[1:12:02] them will I give in my house and within
[1:12:06] my walls a
[1:12:09] place he's going to give it right right
[1:12:12] beside the bride everywhere she
[1:12:14] goes they're going to go right I didn't
[1:12:19] read all of the them in between what we
[1:12:21] got but you already to know
[1:12:23] it even unto them will I give in my
[1:12:26] house and within my walls a place and a
[1:12:29] name better than of sons and
[1:12:33] daughters he's not talking about Sons
[1:12:35] and Daughters of God like we talk of
[1:12:37] sons and daughters because we know that
[1:12:40] they're not greater but are greater than
[1:12:41] Sons and Daughters or you know your sons
[1:12:43] and your
[1:12:45] daughters I will give them an
[1:12:47] everlasting
[1:12:48] name that shall not be cut off that's
[1:12:51] right no wonder they can sing
[1:12:55] a new
[1:12:57] song you want these other quotes about
[1:12:59] being the
[1:13:00] Unix Servants of the Bride you can have
[1:13:03] them brother BR says that
[1:13:07] they they're Temple guards that's
[1:13:11] amen they escort the bride wherever she
[1:13:19] goes what about it
[1:13:23] amen you won't be ARG get fussing over
[1:13:26] who's a servant and who's a
[1:13:32] not it will be a joyous
[1:13:35] opportunity we were able to go up one
[1:13:37] time
[1:13:40] to the uh tomb of unknown soldier how
[1:13:44] many of you probably been
[1:13:46] there if you notice how they guard that
[1:13:50] tomb constantly 24 hours I reckon a day
[1:13:53] I know they do during the daytime
[1:13:55] they guard that
[1:13:57] tomb and we were able to see The
[1:13:59] Changing of the Guard how many's Ever
[1:14:00] Seen The Changing of the Guard actually
[1:14:02] when they changed
[1:14:04] him it's really
[1:14:06] something that guy come out and he's
[1:14:09] walked out and escorted out by someone
[1:14:11] and they got a man there but and he
[1:14:12] looks him over he checks him from one
[1:14:15] end to the other when everything got to
[1:14:17] be to a
[1:14:18] te he takes a gun he looks it over to
[1:14:21] make sure it's clean he does all kind of
[1:14:23] things
[1:14:26] but he's checking him over he won't let
[1:14:29] him go up there I read about it that
[1:14:31] they can only have a 30in
[1:14:33] waist they've got to set themselves
[1:14:35] aside they can only have a 30in
[1:14:39] waist and they looked
[1:14:42] it a special group of people set to dis
[1:14:45] guard and they had certain things
[1:14:48] certain ways certain things and then
[1:14:50] they had to March and they had to guard
[1:14:52] that to of the Unknown Soldier
[1:14:56] but I thought
[1:14:58] about how much man could put
[1:15:02] into doing something you know to be an
[1:15:05] honor right an honor guard you have
[1:15:08] honor guards that goes with the
[1:15:10] president you know he goes anywhere you
[1:15:12] have honor guards with a governor you go
[1:15:15] you have all kind of Honor
[1:15:18] guards and when someone passes away they
[1:15:21] come out you know and they do all of
[1:15:22] their things they're honor God specially
[1:15:24] Le
[1:15:28] people but what
[1:15:30] about
[1:15:32] 144,000 they're going to be keepers of
[1:15:35] the bridal chamber right they're going
[1:15:38] to guard her amen and they would give
[1:15:41] their
[1:15:41] lives for
[1:15:43] her you're not going to get
[1:15:46] there but we know it won't have to be
[1:15:48] gardened like guarding then but it just
[1:15:50] be honor guards right
[1:15:53] amen but they'll be with the bride amen
[1:15:56] not as servants to Pisces biscuits
[1:16:03] right but to make sure the biscuits that
[1:16:05] comes in is all
[1:16:07] right you know that there's people set
[1:16:09] outside I read this one time with the
[1:16:11] president you know that he they can't
[1:16:13] bring him a meal unless it goes to
[1:16:15] certain
[1:16:16] people you ever know read that they
[1:16:20] can't just set him down and give him a
[1:16:21] meal why cuz somebody could poison him
[1:16:23] that's right so it has to go through
[1:16:25] certain channels it has to be certain
[1:16:27] doings those are the honor
[1:16:31] guards but want it be something to be
[1:16:35] there and not look down on them as
[1:16:38] servants cuz remember they give eternal
[1:16:41] life here amen that's right but to see
[1:16:44] them there and realize who they are Y
[1:16:47] and be able to sit down and talk to
[1:16:50] them and be able to listen to them at
[1:16:53] night singing
[1:16:56] their
[1:17:01] songs but R said in the seal book it's
[1:17:04] only seven seal I
[1:17:05] think he said those two witnesses will
[1:17:08] tell Israel said you rejected the right
[1:17:10] of sunship Y and the Gentiles has come
[1:17:13] in and accepted that
[1:17:16] right well you know they don't scream
[1:17:18] and cry and wail because of the fact
[1:17:20] that they missed
[1:17:22] it an opportunity to be they scream and
[1:17:25] cry because they crucified their
[1:17:29] Master a lot of difference in it amen
[1:17:32] they can sing a new song even a song
[1:17:33] that you and I can't
[1:17:35] sing right but you know what they can't
[1:17:38] sing
[1:17:41] ours they can't sing
[1:17:43] ours special
[1:17:45] singing but especially Elite people that
[1:17:48] will be in the millennial
[1:17:51] reign with the BR of Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:56] you see what I'm talking about
[1:17:58] Unix these are not physical Unix they
[1:18:02] are people who set aside themselves not
[1:18:06] to receive any of the doctrines it says
[1:18:08] right amen that's it they receive none
[1:18:12] of the doctrines of the old mother
[1:18:15] even though their nation is in a
[1:18:16] covenant with the
[1:18:18] Antichrist they will give their
[1:18:22] lives right right right for the
[1:18:28] gospel what about you and I come on this
[1:18:32] what about you and
