together for a long time but anyway they're they're real good friends so he's with us tonight so um daniel chapter 5 of verse 8 verse 18 starting and here's daniel and we know the scripture daniel speaking to belshazzar who was the king after nebuchadnezzar and he's and he's speaking because this is where the handwriting on the wall comes in the unknown writing and they were looking for somebody that can interpret and daniel says oh thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father which actually i think if you look it up is actually his grandfather but the the scripture father there actually means can be referring to grandfather also says gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor and for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive in whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened and pride he was disposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beast and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men that he appointed over it whomsoever he will but thou his son o belshazzar has not humbled thy heart though thou knewest all this now that's what i want you to look at he said he knew all of this remember remember the last time we were talking when we when when jesus in matthew tells him he said fill ye up the measure of your fathers because remember he said y'all polished the tombs of the ones that your fathers put in there he said but has lifted up thine cell up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords and the wives and the concubines have drunk wine in them and thou has praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor no and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified then was the part of the hand sent before him and this writing was written and this is the writing that was written many many tackle of sharon this is the interpretation of the thing many god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it tackle thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting paris thy kingdom is divided and given unto the medes and persians then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom and that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain amen god bless you tonight you can have your seats and so i want to kind of look at this as a as a continuation and as jesus was telling the the scribes in the and the pharisees when they there in matthew 23 you know as was was speaking of last time when he began to speak to him and tell them about their work and you know they as they began to look at all of the the the fineries and all the things that they had in their and you know they were telling jesus you know what what you know what a great uh lineage we have and what a great reputation we have and all these things of what they come from and jesus said you know he said woe unto you scribes and pharisees he said because your fathers had heard the word he said through the prophets and the righteous and he said you slew them he said you put them in the graves and he said y'all go out there and you polish the tombs which they are in and he said you we know by your own testimony that you're of as we said last time we knew that you're of your father the devil you're of the of that language that natural language but also the spiritual image of the same ones because they didn't agree with the word and he began to point to the word and he said y'all don't believe the word but he said you stand there and say if we were back there in that day we wouldn't do the same things that our fathers done and jesus pointed out to him he said the word has been made manifest in a greater way in front of you and you've turned it down so you're just as guilty as they are and as we were speaking of last time in the scripture and uh ezekiel and jeremiah where he talks about the the fathers who ate the sour grapes and the t and the children teeth were set on edge and they want to go back and point to the to the fathers it's all their fault it was all their fault it's like no you can't use that scripture anymore because when the word was made real to you when the word is made manifest to you then you're responsible for it you can't look back to some other age because when the word is made manifest to you when the word when god opens your eyes to it then you're responsible for it and so we we look at this and i was thinking of of here in the in the scripture because you know when daniel's speaking of nebuchadnezzar you know when when nebuchadnezzar begins to speak and he and you know he was he had such a great kingdom as daniel talks about here he had this great kingdom that was rose up and god blessed him god rose him up for a purpose to do and you know he had all of that he had all these all this power and and authority and all these riches and and the all these different things he had all that but he was in god's hands because god put him in that position and you know we we see that later on when god had had the spirit to come upon him that he become just like an animal was out in the field eating grass and just a wild man had lost his mind but when god humbled nebuchadnezzar and he put him in that position when he came back see then he realized that you know i don't have control of this i'm not in control god is in control of this but see the rebuke that came to belshazzar and under that day is he said you saw those things you knew what happened to your grandfather you saw the condition that nebuchadnezzar was in and you saw that then all of a sudden realized nebuchadnezzar realized and gave homage to god because he realized you know i'm not in control god is but he said to belshazzar he said your problem is and the rebuke that came to belshazzar was that when god spoke to you and you saw what had happened previously and you did not go on and follow that then when god tried to deal with you he couldn't deal with you because you were hard your heart was hardened so you would not go so he so that's the reason the handwriting came on the wall and god told come and and you know then he realized that he had no one in his kingdom that could interpret that none of the wise men none of the physicians no none of the anybody could could astrologers whoever it was nobody could interpret that but the scripture tells us that when they went looking for somebody they said oh there's a great man and there's a prophet in our day that has the ability to make these things known that god speaks through and is able to interpret these things and give the truth and he says then who calls daniel to to the place and he says daniel give us the interpretation if you can and you know then he offers daniel all these riches and everything and daniel's like listen he said you keep all of that he said i don't want any of that he said my job is just to declare the word of the lord and that's what he began to tell belshazzari begins to give belshazzar the rebuke that he gave him because it became the time that he began to tell him these things listen this is the condition that you're in you have been weighed in the balance and found wanting why because you've turned down the word for your day you've turned down the word amen and see it's it's a it's a the scripture says you know we also give a a greater heed a more earnest heed to the things that we've heard because you know the thing is is just like when you hear something and you see something where because in our day we don't have an excuse when and and the times passed you know god weaked at people's ignorance he looked back he looked over things that people but you know what when it's been taught and it's been made declared to you then you have then you're then you're the one that has to answer amen what will you do with this jesus christ this is uh from the message beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation now brother broom says now notice then god took king nebuchadnezzar and he made him a tool in his hand when king nebuchadnezzar died after he had the grass had the grass grow out his hair like a lion or eagles feathers and his fingernails like the claws of an eagle and so forth and god had let him know who was the real king after his death belshazzar's grandson succeeded him then he was more wicked than king nebuchadnezzar and one night there they had a great big party they called all the magistrates and all the officers in for a great big jamboree and while they were having this jamboree they went and called out and took the vessels the holy vessels of god just to make fun of god now listen to this and drink wine to their gods a toast out of the vessels of the lord a man is permitted to travel so far but there is a separating line between life and death he must never cross that sea you can go on with your little foolishness for a while but you better know where that line is did the lord ever check you on anything he does it he does all of us pull the check reigns that that's far enough now then you better watch what you're doing from now on if you're stepping across towards that line and that night when god pulled the check reigns on him and he wouldn't listen goes on down brings out the vessels of the lord began to drink wine in them and toast their gods then there came a hand down out of heaven and wrote on the wall many many tickle of sharon meaning thou art weighed in the balance and found warning no one could interpret it it was unknown tongues and there was a man there that had the gift of interpretation daniel so he comes down and interprets and tells the king what would happen and their god destroyed that nation babylon so we see what happened and this is from the message three kinds of believers and so i hope you all don't mind i'm gonna read maybe a couple of quotes here just to lay a foundation again but this is from uh three kinds of believers brother bram says nebuchadnezzar though having daniel as his god called him belter which was the name of his god so we know that two things that come out of this when uh when we look at this you know there's we see that brother brahm talks about the the gentile kingdom gentile dispensation it come in with man worship and unknown tongues and we see that how that came about and it came and it brought destruction it says he called him belgius chapter was the name of his god saw daniel do the great works of god and then he know that beltashas are believed or that daniel was a god so he made an image unto him and put it out there and made everybody worship it and so for see the king the gentile kingdom came in with forcing of the worship of an image of a holy man and the gentile kingdom goes out with the forcing of the image of a holy man see same way and there was a handwriting on the wall of unknown tongues at the beginning of the gentile kingdom that no one could read but that prophet and there is a handwriting on the wall today that's wrote ichabod that the glory of god has departed from them things and the handwriting is on the wall can be read by the spiritual mind that believes in spiritual things has been born of the spirit of god oh bow to shazza goes out and that that's actually supposed to should be belshazzar not built this yazar goes out and gets these vessels of the of the lord to drink wine and then why he was an unbeliever he thought he was a believer but he was an unbeliever see that's it he disbelieved the word so he disbelieved what god told him and he saw those things and knowing you know the the interesting thing when you look at this you know they when when you look at babylon and those you know they were not uh uneducated people they were not uh i mean when you think when you think about babylon babylon was one of the if not the premier nation at the time i mean that was that was the the epicenter of the world so when you look at when you look to see what was going on there you know it wasn't because they knew because they studied they had great men great men of learning so you know the thing the things of the laws of god was not foreign to them especially when they had daniel and the different ones that had been been there and they had lived and they had studied all these things so when it comes to this place it wasn't that they didn't know these things they were they were fully aware of all of these things and seen the power of god but when you see all of these things that were taking place yet they just began to gloss over them and they and they didn't have any reverence to these things even when even when belshazzar saw what took place with nebuchadnezzar and then when they saw all of the things that god had done yet when they went in and took those vessels you know those those things were still um it meant a lot to god and they were still holy wherever they were at you know it's just like it's just like when they when they took the uh ark of the covenant when they took the ark and they and they moved it when they took it and they the philistines had captured and they brought it before dagon then you know what even though they were even though it was in the possession of the enemy the ark of the covenant still was holy and it still was powerful so when it laid before when they put it in there in their in their temple before dagon showing that because the ark of the covenant was was where the god's presence came in the temple that meant that that was where god's uh where the where the priest offered the blood were that where they sprinkled the blood before the mercy seat see that was an important part to the israel's uh the children of israel's worship that was an important part of what they done and then when the philistines took it then they were like hey we're going to put it over here because dagon has overtaken god the children of israel's god but you know what every single time when when they put him in there and as soon as the ark went into the end of that temple went into the presence of their god then god caused that thing to smash that thing was smashed every single time even though it was in the wrong place but they thought well you know because when they but when they rose up in themselves and hey you know what i got something to tell you we're captured we're you know their god's not any it's not powerful well we we know in the scripture they had a hard time god made them very uncomfortable it changed it changed their lives and you know when and it made it made them so it was so painful for them and it made them so uncomfortable that you know god even made them they made golden images of that why because that was always a sign unto them of what god done to them and you know after a while the philistines were ready to move that thing because you know what you can't you can't have a halfway life you can you can't you can't bring in bring the word of god in and have have it a little bit over here and a little bit over there you know because you know what you're going to be getting really uncomfortable you see people that are miserable in their lives why because they want to dabble in the world a little bit over here and they want a little bit of the church over here you know they want to they want to be church christian on on sunday but they want to live to live like the world out on on saturday or any other day of the week you know because you know you can't live like the world and die like paul you can't you can't have both of them you're going to have to you're going to have to either be one or the other because you can't have both of them you can't be you can't serve god and mammon but when they when they come through that then they want to get rid of that ark because that ark was too much problems for them and they had to get rid of that ark of the covenant and even even where when they got rid of it you know the people that that broke and took the ark of the covenant you know wherever that thing went you know they had to be respectful to that thing because god had had respect to that ark when when they brought that when they brought that thing forward just like when when when they when they when they brought it out and they said it in the man's house you know the man was blessed by it that it was that it was in his home that he kept it and you know david had a david had had a great uh revelation one day david had a great revelation that you know hey we we need to get we need to get this ark in front of the people we need to bring this thing up and we need to consult the ark of the covenant we need to why because we've not had it before it's been it's been out of our presence for so long we need to bring it in but you know the problem was david had a great revelation the problem was he didn't follow anything that it should have been done amen the revelation brother adam said the problem with david was he got the revelation and not not nathan nathan's revelation was because he was the prophet david was not and then when he was supposed to bring the ark of the covenant it wasn't supposed to be brought on a cart it wasn't supposed to be brought by oxen the law never changed and what what would happen if he if he would have consulted nathan and not anybody else but he went to nathan david would have got the word of god because nathan would have told him what to do why because it's supposed to be carried on the shoulders of the levites and then it would have came in that way i was looking at what brother chris had to say sunday talking about the oxen stumbled why because none of that was correct there was only one person that should have been consulted and that was the prophet the prophet had the word and then everything else would have been in line but they didn't but they didn't follow it yet and but they had so many people oh yeah this is great david this is great this is great we like it it's all contrary to the word he had he had the right motive and objective but he followed it totally wrong and when it when it came in the and the oxen stumbled then then uh perez or whatever uh believe was his name you know he put his hand forth to catch it why because because he was trying to do something for god david was trying to do something it was out of the will of god but he wanted to do something for god and here parents trying to do the exact same thing and it caused his death and then david said what are we going to do now we got to put everything though we've got to stop everything and he was so upset how are we going to do this and then and then later on in the another chapter i believe the next chapter we find out here's david standing up and say the ark is coming back but the ark is coming on the shoulders of the levites why because he never done it exactly exactly the way that it should have come and if he'd have followed that then it would have wouldn't have been death and it wouldn't have been death it would have been destruction but that's what took place and see that's the same way when we have we have a a thing that takes place when when the word of god has went forth when when we see the the age and the time in which we live when things don't follow that there's only one thing god has whatever takes place god will always use a prophet to make that what make the word known and to let to identify the doubt the time of the day and and the way out and the way things ought to be and so there's so we there's no second guessing there's no there's no confusion why because there's a way made to know these things this is uh from the smyrna church age the church age book brother brahm says he said now you might want to scold me right here for what what i've said he said all right he said they call themselves pentecostal in full full gospel he said let them prove it at pentecost the fire came in a cloud and separated each of them like a tongue over each of them like a tongue and fell on each one he said where is the fire they spoke in tongues at pentecost and the people who listened understood where is that the whole multitude of believers acted like one family pentecostals are as badly divided as any group in history no man just joined himself to the early church but only god added they have as many goats among them as any they claim to be full gospel they prove it their churches are as empty as power as any of them if they are full gospel then we had better admit that bible made a mistake when it describes the full gospel men at pentecost they sing there's been a great change in me but the change has not been for the better i'm thinking about that today there's been a great change in great change in me but if we don't follow the word it only makes you worse it is time to get back to god they have a name that they live but they are dead tongues isn't the evidence of revival it's the evidence of death tongues proclaimed the evidence that a ceremonial religion of the jews was over that a new era had begun tongues today is is ringing down the curtain on the gentile church ages and the gospel is going back to the jews people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat the truth is that the handwriting that the writing i'm sorry the truth is that it is writing the finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of god is being ushered in wake up people of god wake up he said if you don't think this true just listen to this all over the world in both pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen he said they've invaded the pulpit without a call from god they have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of god and they say and they say the gifted ministry of ephesians 4 10 through 13 that god gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy called the gang sayings of korah and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth you know it's so amazing i was listening i don't know if y'all saw that you know creflo dollar just announced the other day he said that uh he said any of my teachings he on on tithing and all of the giving and all that he said throw all those books and those dvds and everything away and then he got up and pro and proceeded to tell everybody that uh tithing is unscriptural here's a man that goes from one one extreme to the other and it's like well you know the problem is is there's got to be a balance because you know do you know because we're we're if you're going to split the the word then where why don't we just throw it all away well you know it you know you know if we get rid of the ti well tithing's not in the in the new testament we don't we don't see any of that and you know we don't i was like you know there is one spot in the in the scripture in the new testament when jesus is watching a widow woman and she throws in all she has i know that's an interesting thing because she only had two arms and she gave that and you know what and jesus marveled at her because she gave all that she had she gave out of her need and not out of her abundance it's like well if we want to look at so the one that if you you know just want to be carnal if we only look at what jesus admired and what jesus proclaimed to the disciples and all that he said give everything so you know what we should own anything because if you go back and look in the book of acts what did they do they took everything that they had and they sold and they added everything together and they had it all to common so that so that had the person that had a lot didn't have it didn't lack anything and the one that didn't have anything didn't like either why because it was all together as a common goal but you know it it's interesting how they you know it's not in the new testament it's not well yeah it's what you want to look at because you know the thing is if we take the scripture then we have to take all the scripture we got to look all the way through the scripture what did what did god require you know because when when you look in the scripture everybody's like well why don't we why why isn't we not still offering sacrifices why because we had a sacrifice we didn't have to have we didn't have to have a lamb why because we had one that fulfilled that they had one that was perfect that came and he and he fulfilled all the law that we don't have to have that because you know what if i'm out there offering lambs and bull locks and turtle doves then you know what i'm counting the blood of christ unworthy because he's the one that i'm that i'm taking and i'm that he's the he's the one that i take as as my sacrifice then i don't have to have a a one that i'm trying to find a perfect lamb because god identified that that he was coming and john identified him so that when we look back we can see the perfect one that died for our sins so i'm still under that blood i'm still claiming that token i'm still claiming that so i'm still under the blood because but you know what it's been fulfilled the old testament part of it has been fulfilled and it's a new and better way that we have because we have we have eternal redemption through this one because blood the blood of bulls and goats never could take away sin it never could take away the conscience of sin never could take away the desire of sin but we have one that can be changed one because the the life that was in that perfect lamb can came back can come back on the believer who so that the the life that was in that perfect lamb which is the life of god can come back on us and that we can be made perfect that we can become the children of god because we are we're just like him the representatives of god because that's that is such a great thing to realize that you know i had there's a way to get past how whatever we come the way we come in this world in sin and all of our shortcomings and all of our problems all of our failures whatever we have there's a way made that i can overcome because you know there is a way made i don't have to live the way that i you know well i i was just born this way i was just born this way you know i was born this way but you know what there is a perfect lamb there's there's a sacrifice there's a fountain open in the house of david for sin and uncleanness that will come and clean you clean you and turn you into a child of god i don't have to live that way the problem is is when we walk out there and we we just claim that hey i just i'm just born this way i was just born this way well guess what that's the reason that jesus said ye must be born again why because there's a way made to con to do away with all this thing to do away with your first birth but the problem is is when we want to stand up and we want to wave our flags and we want to get up and and proclaim the pride i tell you when when you see that it's it's filthy but you know it's it's the same way you know it it's it's really interesting i always i always find it kind of kind of comical we got people that you know that's like you know that is so that is such a horrible thing and that's an abomination and i was like do you know that fornication is too i was and then you know because people say well you know you know you know heterosexual straight people and it's like listen i wouldn't stand up and proclaim against somebody else if i was out doing the exact same thing and it's like well you know listen fornication and adultery is an abomination before god just like just like sodomy living living a homosexual lifestyle that's against the word of god well guess what all the other things are too there ain't no big sins and ain't no little sense but you know if you if you if you think it's okay to be one way then don't don't go around trying to point fingers and and run everybody else down just like just like you hear people and hear people talking and jesus said he said that if if you run down your brother if you try to kill a brother's influence and you know this and this is this is for people out in the world too if you if you go out and stab somebody in the back are you somebody you say you're somebody's friend and you treat somebody like that the way people treat each other and and that's it you know like they say keep your friends close and your enemies closer and you do people like that it's like you know that's just like murdering somebody jesus said that jesus said if you were to look upon a woman to lust after you've already committed adultery you don't even have to do a physical act all you gotta do is sit and watch them but if you'll do that then you know what you can't get out and proclaim against somebody else it's like well you know that's just actually he's like yeah that's the way you were born you know the same same sin that you you preach against somebody else yeah that's the way they were born the same way you were born you were born under sin you were born with a fall of nature and you come you can come to a church and you and you shake you shake the preacher's hand and you can get baptized and you can read the bible just like just like they said you know you know they got you know they get they say they got jesus in their heart well you know what jesus don't act like it but you know that you god calls us to live a life of holiness and you know when you when you look at this and it's like when you get to the place where well i don't know about that well i don't i don't know about that well that's the problem when you when the when the spirit of god comes in jesus said how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he said he'll lead you and guide you into all truth then if he's the spirit of truth then when the scripture says and you know you know he don't and whether you believe it or not god didn't make a contradiction in the word he didn't make a mistake when he wrote the word so what so when he begins to tie when he begins to talk about these things it's like well exactly where are we going to put these things the way the way men dress the way women dress the way people act whether whether whether you believe it or not it's still the same it didn't change god didn't stutter anywhere in the word whatever said whatever he says in black and white it's the truth and you can try to as as people have tried to do today they've tried to take and tried to find different interpretations and translations and they've tried to go back and well you got to study more of the greek or whatever you know what you need is is to realize that god wrote the scripture and he's the only one that's going to interpret the word but when he tells how he's going to do it then he always done it the same way there's only one way that god ever interpreted his word was he spoke it through the mouth of a prophet and the word was the prophets came and interpreted exactly what the prophet said there's only one way that's going to take place god doesn't need doesn't need a group of people to figure this thing out god doesn't need a council to figure this thing out he doesn't he doesn't need intelligent people all he needs is people that are sold out to the point to believe that god is the one in control and he can move and speak he's still moving today still speaking today and whatever we have need of he'll speak to us it didn't change what god said in his word he's still the same yesterday today and forever brother brown says continuing on here in the smyrna church age he says when did prestige and money and social leadership and tur business ability or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of god when in any way materially or human values begin to show as the media by which god works instead of the holy spirit alone then we are fighting against god not for him he begins he says you know speaking against elders i was joking with this this black man he's a he's a real good friend of ours he's a he's a deacon in a baptist church and i always kill him he always tells everybody that uh he said he always tells me he said tells everybody about me he says now you got to watch aaron he said he got a lot of money he just used he's just using tag for a decoy yeah yeah yeah mr eddie i'm just here cause i want to you know but i told him he's a deacon in church i said when was the last time you seen a poor deacon when you look at when you go to the baptist church tell me where a poor deacon's at last time i looked as scarce as hen's teeth that's what i always tell him but that's why i get back at him but what you know brother ham said he says that an elder can be as poor or rich as anybody else he said he said it's what what's in his heart and that elder can be as poor as any man was ever poor or be the richest man in the world as long as he is elder in heart indeed he said i would not hesitate to ordain a man that has the real spiritual qualifications as an elder or deacon regardless of his finances or social position he continues on here but when you see a social or financial structure come into the church divides the folks in any way that is not of god it is another sign of the time in this physically rich but spiritually impoverished laodicean age in which we are now living because it's all about who's got money and you see that it's it's like well you know we want we want the people that's got money and we're gonna we're gonna lean to them and cater to them well it doesn't really matter who's rich or who's poor it's whatever the leadership of the holy ghost is and and if you're not happy with it then it's time to go you know there's two things you can do you can either get an altar and get through and pray through to god and get right with god or leave it can't but you know you can't argue with people it's it's got to be the to see that the leadership god the holy spirit has called leadership in the church and they're the ones in charge i hear people all the time you know they i shouldn't say all the time but i've heard it plenty of times that you know people they'll stand around and it's like but why do they do that and why did they do that and why did they say that well you know what brother i'm i'm gonna but you know what i get tired and i tell you one thing before you open your mouth you need to pray because you know that's a that's a problem that people have is because they all sit around and you know what you're sowing seeds in people's minds you know i've heard i've heard young people that have heard just like elisha those children heard their mom and daddies running down the prophet and it caused their death and you know what i've heard people that come back young people and some of them have grown up but you know what that's that you know that's like well who you supposed to trust because you know what they heard all kinds they heard they got a belly full of stuff growing up as children their parents were unhappy and all they they went to church they went and sent a message pew and all they could do was is run people down or argue or question everything and you know that's that's so sees in children's minds and when they grow up you know what they got no use for it so what do we need to do we need to keep our mouth closed we need to make sure that our speech is always controlled by the holy ghost our words need to be and you know and i i don't know i understand you know i'm not i'm not saying i'm perfect or all right that i got this under i got a handle on this because i don't because you know what we still we still live in this realm and we still have to get get uh forgiveness for things that we say and sometimes we pop off but you know there's one thing there's one thing about it i i i still this is this is still my church and like i said last time whoever the pastor you know until god tells me to leave i'm here and i got my shoulders to the wheel i got my shoulder to i'm still pressing on and whether whether you whether you go or you stay god bless you you do whatever but i'm still here i'm still pressing this battle i'm still going to support everything that takes place whether i agree with it or not but you know what it ain't my it ain't my place to do it unless i see something in the word that's contrary that it's not my place the only thing my the only thing i know the the prophet told me that i was supposed to pray are you supposed to pray for the pastor we're supposed to we're supposed to pray for the for the ministers we're supposed to pray for the leadership in the church so i'm not i'm not i'm not going you know but i i will i will say this much i will say this much praise the lord going to anyway but you know what it's it's a good idea and i i pray that maybe one of these days it'll work out for me then when somebody starts to talk anything it's just time to do a 180 and start making tracks if anybody wants to get on the phone and you ain't got nothing good to talk about bye exactly let's get rid of it cut it off because if it's not if it's not edifying if it's not if it's not that's going to help anybody we just need to get rid of it it's not going to help anybody if we spent more time talking to god about issues and problems than talking to each other we'd have we'd have a much better church and i'm talking about this church i'm talking about every church i but you know i'm i i i have such a desire to to get through because i i want everybody to us to see what god has given us and what god wants us to do if god has called us to this place then we need to see who we are and what god has for us to do because as as we see here in the scripture and i'm i'm probably not going to get done tonight but that's all right i'm going to get as far as i can but when we see the scripture what what took place in the past what what has happened and when all these things were given to us as examples then what then we ought to give a more earnest heed to these things that we've seen to understand these things have happened for a reason and we we see all these things that happen when when the word has come forth and people have turned the word down and they have just not given the uh honest heed to the word and if you've not and they've not done that if they've not received the word for their day they've not seen the word then then it's time to come to a place and realize that it's a late hour it's a it's a late hour that you we don't know how much longer we've got this is from the god of this evil age i'm going to try to hurry through this and brother i'm speaking he says notice how beautiful this is number six brothers he said notice how beautiful the scripture ties themselves together in every age notice now when the church world would not have the word of god to rule over them he said they accepted a murder barabbas what did this do it exalted satan the god of this evil age to a place that he's always wanted now listen for satan to not is for satan is not spoken as a god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of god of the god of mo the age of moses the god of the age of elijah the but the evil age this evil age he is don't miss it he is the god of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it but let's let's let the scripture uncover this morning and let's see you'll see then you'll know that he's been the god of this evil age and so as we and people don't even realize who they're worshiping millions and billions of people are worshiping why because they've had a false religion they've had a false word given to them and they believe it and this is from what shall we do with this jesus this jesus called christ he says now look upon the the trial here and he's he's speaking about good friday and the trial that they brought jesus to when when they arrested him and he says and the very same thing that we're talking about that happened on that good friday is is right under our noses today and our elders are doing the same thing they did taking it right in on a similar trial after a similar promised word of this day has been a vindicated just the same as it was vindicated there jesus a common carpenter's voice so thought he was the word of god made manifest and he was thoroughly identified because the works of god had manifested himself through him and proved that he was the messiah and he said he said and today that similar case has come again when the holy spirit has come upon us in the last day and identified himself right in our church and has proven the same works that he did when he was here in the fullness upon jesus christ he did the same thing upon the bride doing the same thing and still we want to get rid of it when he's identifying himself what's the truth and showing the same thing that took place in jesus day is the same thing that's happened today and people turn it down when they don't give an earnest heat to when they don't really pay attention to it then they miss who who christ is continuing on here he says when the apostles were preaching the gospel and come down through irenaeus and many of the great reformers and founders back in the in the early age and it came to nicea one one time for a showdown and they decided to make a universal church to force people to come under their jurisdiction many who has read the history here notice how many old prophets came there with animal skin wrapped around them eating only herbs and things and they tried to hold out for that word hold for the word of god but what did they do that 15 days of bloody politics they finally decided to make a universal church and they graphed some paganism with christianity and set it out as a universal church and he said and today the protestants are throwing themselves together in the ecumenical council doing the same thing grafting in tradition of man instead of taking the word of god which is thoroughly identified by the holy ghost that he's the same yesterday today and forever the church stands in the balance today and is found warning you're back in pilate's judgment hall yes sir what does he do it's making an image unto the beast it's a satellite under rome when the ecumenical council is forcing will force every protestant denomination into it it is practically all their now full gospel and all the hour is going to come when they when they'll have to come or stay out and at that time when the force come they'll all ready you've already identified yourself with the mark of beast now that's exactly and continuing on drop down he says but we bring christ again to that great crucial hour that he stood in in pilate's judgment hall pathetically a little bunch pushing off to one side with a bowed head other denominations rejected him refused him refused them and turned them away and said have nothing to do with it you better check up on the word when now we find out this ecumenical council is what is it what it what's it doing see it the bible you say does the bible say does the bible say about that yes having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof blind naked churchgoers having a form of godliness but denying the power of the holy ghost which identifies jesus christ to his word how can a man claim to have the holy spirit and die the very word which is the holy spirit how can a man do that his own testimony gives witness that he is not what he is supposed to be committing spiritual fornication denying the power of god paul said in second timothy third chapter that's what it'll be said be heady and high-minded so we know that they have turned the word down and when the word is made made manifest then they deny it and it's the same as it was back then the word is still come and everybody says well that's just the nominations no that's this message see that's the reason you got to check up every day because there's many people that you know they just go to church and they just listen but you know what they've not they've not come to a complete sellout they've not come to a place where they realize who they are you know one of these days brother bram said you know they're going to wake up and realize it's all over with and they're not in they're not they're not sealed in they're just going to be standing around looking they're not going to be sealed in and it's going to be a sad day but we see that as as we see how the condition that the the the world has ended all the the things that have that has happened but you know god said that and all the things that took place in in the uh god of this evil age and satan's eating the different messages we've seen the condition that the world is in and satan had his rule and his reign and and all the things that he's done but you know what god promised in the last days that there would be a restoration and as we go through and i'm not i'm not going to read all of it but you know brother brown speaking of the restoration of the bride tree and he and and joel and it says here i i do want to read joel chapter one it says in the word of the lord that came to joel the son of a fuel he said hear this ye old man and give here all you inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers he said tell your children of it and and your children their children and their children another generation i thought that was good because you know here's nebuchadnezzar and his grandson belshazzar is the one that the end came to but here's here's joel speaking he said tell your children and your children and the children the third generation he said that which the palmer worth have left has to locus eaten and that which the locust has eaten left the locust left then the cankle worm has eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left at the caterpillar eat but joel 2 says but i will restore unto you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty now listen to this all of the destruction that took place but here's here's this promise but you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that he hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and brother brown we begin to speak in the in the mess the restoration of the bride tree and he begins to talk about how each one of those the palmer worm he ate the uh he ate the fruits and then you know each one of them came through the locusts ate the ate the i believe the leaves and brother brown tells about you know because they said the locusts ate the leaves which was the fella divine fellowship and he began to talk about how how the cankerworm he said he ate the bark brother brown says one place he talks about the cankerworm eating the doctrine he got rid of the doctrine because when he ate the doctrine he said then he ate he got into the tree by eating the bark he said which was the doctrine he said when you do away with a doctrine then the holy spirit wasn't able to move he said then he said then when the caterpillar came he went into the tree and he took the life and he said he ate it down to the stump he ate all the tree everything was ate away but then he said but but but the prophecy was he said when all of this takes place he said but i'm going to restore he said i'm going to restore all those years all of the things that have been taken away he said it's going to come back and he said all of that's coming back he said all the years that each one of them has eaten each one of them's coming back and so what is that it's a prophecy for our day because this is the day that all of the fullness is going to come so all so what does that happen he said the bark so the holy spirit began to move the word came back there was a restoration of the word and then we see that the restoration brought the gifts and it brought divine fellowship and it brought the fruits of the spirit so we see the day that and in the past when all those things took place then what took place in the beginning of the day of pentecost is the same thing that takes place today and we see that it was it was a prophecy that was going to take place to see and when we when we begin to look at at this here ephesians 1 chapter 4 i want to read this and it says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ he said till we all come to the unity of faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the fathers unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ because that was the fullness that the pentecostal fathers had that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sight of men and and cracked us whereby they lie in wait to deceive by speaking truth and love may grow up in him and all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the unto the edifying of itself in love and so we know that when it began to speak that this was going to take place then we know that that's what malachi 4 come to do we received a promise that it would take place that all of the restoration had to come within you know we see that martin luther done his part but that was that was a partial restoration because it was they were reformers they weren't they weren't full restoration but it was a coming back of the tree so there was only there was only so much that that luther was able to do but that was truth and then wesley was able to pick that up and continue on but there had to be one that come to bring us back to the fullness of the pentecostal fathers and when you when you look at this you know it's so amazing because you see people and they and they read these scriptures and it's just like you know we just we just pull things out of the air no no but but when you take the scripture and you take the scripture and you look here at malachi 4 and when it's when you speak of what it what it tells you he said behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and brother branham they ask i believe they ask him one time in questions and answers and they ask him about that he's like listen that's not the same person because he said john can only a fulfill part of that and then somebody says well where's that in the scripture luke 4. and you take somebody to look for and you show them and here it is it's perfect but there's something because like pop said one time he said if you if you just go if you go to the if the fathers go to the children and the children go right back then you just went right back to where you started you're not any further along but see that's what that's what john come to do he come to turn the fathers to the children to see that there was a changing of dispensation of what was taking place and when you see all that our day is the day of restoration it's a fullness that we're going back to what they had that god could show us these things that we're going back to that people say oh i wish i lived in the day of peter and john and paul you're living the same day of the same word it's the same it's the same god working today it's like oh i wish i was in the day of the apostles it is the this is the day why because it's the same word luther didn't have that word wesley didn't have that word pentecost didn't have that word but you know what we've got that word when when you go back and you know how many people understood the statue of a perfect man to add to your faith with all diligence when you say all diligence well you know and then then it's a sell out it's a time that you give every every heed everything to do that to pro to take a take a full measure of everything to look to where you need to be to and then if we see where we need to be then if we allow god to come on the scene to speak to us then we know how where we are and what we need to do and how to move forward then to add to your faith because it takes god to do that but you know when god shows you then you take a step then god's leading you then you're adding by the word then you're adding virtue to your faith and knowledge but it's god doing the work it's god leading you because it's god drawing you and the only one and the only one that's holding us back the only one that's hindering us is us then we're we hinder ourselves but see he gave us this promise the mount the messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is to do two things he said one according to malachi 4 would turn the hearts of the children of the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 7 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so so i want to here is uh this is from harvest time i want to read this right quick he says now doesn't malachi 4 teach us that before the great and terrible day of the lord shall come that this will take place how many knows that he will restore the hearts of the children to the fathers is that right the faith of the original pentecostal fathers and in that day luke 17 20 i believe it is 1730 i believe i believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people see the word itself made flesh in you you're a reflection of this hour the message reflection of it see you live again the life live the life that was in jesus christ you're in the presence of the son then to the what happens to it what happens to that church finally listen that shuck pulls away [Music] from that wheat when it begins to be manifested what happened the life that was in the shuck went on into the wheat the life won't change the carriers change they denominate see the blades the tassel the shuck but the weak can't change it's got to be a ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word like the first church was on the word spirit filled word fed not denominational fit word faith so that's what has been given in our we we have this the word has been given for us this is our day to be a reflection of this to be a manifestation of the word for our day god has brought this to us that we can see these things to realize what god is doing in our in our hour to lay in the presence of the sun this is from spiritual food and due season and brother brown says he said no but now god has promised us these things in the last days in malachi 4 said that said that jesus christ would come down and impersonate himself in human flesh like he did at sodom that's right and said the world would be in a sodom condition it said it was then the son of man will be revealed that day see this son this man that come down in the form of a man which was elohim by abraham before this promised son came look what what it was abraham said it was god the bible said it was three men come to him dust on their clothes travel sit down and eat like men and jesus said just at the time the world gets in a sodden condition then the son of man will reveal himself again not son of god son of man see would reveal himself now mark that with what the last prophet said behold i send you elijah the prophet he will restore the hearts of the children back to the father see a message to bring them back to the bible and the son of man will be revealing himself in that day and that day of the sounding of the last church age the seventh angel the mysteries of god should be made known in that day the seven seals would be broken the mysteries of all these churches and things how that would happen and what what taken place to see the day that we i know this is all i mean this is all common but you know i tell you what if it ever gets common to you we we need to get in the altar but i tell you what it it stirs your soul one because when you realize what god has done for us in our day to see the restoration that's come what god has done for us in our day and i'm not i'm not going to be able to finish this but i do i do want to read this this one quote this is from from here ye him and may look at some of this later on sometime but this is this is number 19 brothers this is the last one brother brahms says he said i've begun to realize he said that i'm not no boy no more and what i've got to do i've i got to do it right away for one thing then another thing knowing that the coming the lord is so close that hand what type of people should we be how should we conduct ourselves and how should we be waiting with great enthusiasm and anticipation waiting for the coming of the lord winning every soul to christ that we can for the hour is getting darker and darker as the storm clouds of unbelief and skepticism move over our beloved nation but it's time to thrust in the sickle now and get what we can i've often wondered well lord you'll you'll have this you'll have to have a great this or that before you come well i've read i then read a scripture here a few weeks ago that changed my opinion on that you know the lord is coming for a great church that's right but we've had 2 000 years making up that church there's already waiting out yonder for the resurrection and and who went down in the faith the fathers and mothers who fought to win the prize and sell through bloody seas what type of people should we be today he said there isn't one thing left i see in the prophetic word one thing left or one thing hindering the coming of the lord jesus christ this very hour not one thing left in the bible everything has been fulfilled waiting now for the coming of the lord jesus and now should we how should we do this afternoon we should speak and act today as if this is the last hour we'll ever have and who knows but what it might be it may be for some of us and it may be for all of us but let's act as if it's our last hour let's pray as never before and let's be a blessing to others and try to do all we can for remember this is only one time that we're mortal from this on from the time that we leave this leave this world we go into another world and we'll never have the opportunity to win one soul in that world all that's going to be one will be one right now and if this and if this may be our last hour then what should we do on this hour amen well god bless you this evening let's all stand i just want to read that because as what kind of people should we be when we see the hour and we see the fulfillment of god's word in this hour and the you see the the world is blind to it and god is trying to make himself known to the world and and speak through the word and he's beginning to speak and continue to speak and and people have not received it and so many have that have gathered around the word but they've not got in the word and what kind of people should we ought to be if we realize this is our last day only thing that we do for god is the only thing that'll count and that's that's what i want to leave you with tonight i wanted i want to give my all and i fell miserably but i i still have that desire that's my desire to see each one of you go further in god to do whatever you have need of that's what i'll that's what i want to see you know it it'd be it'd be a terrible thing to wait to reach that day and then you realize you know what when you've not done all when you've not done your all will you not give your all amen and i i i realize that you know you're predestinated to reach that goal but you know i want i want to make sure that my voice is on record just like brother ramsay my voice is on record crying out and telling people to turn from that he said if you saw somebody going over going to that great cataracts and he said you know they're in that boat and they're not going to make it he said he said if in love he said you'd be screaming out to them to give every every heed to them to let them know listen you you've got to heed my warning you're not going to make it and i want everybody to understand that there's so many people that and i you know we just can't be we just can't be relaxed about it i i can say i've spent too many years that same way and but i i i just have i just have a desire you know i look back at brother branham and and he was talking about he said boy if you're ever going to do anything he said you need to do it now he'd never been around the world seven times he's like well if brother brown thought he hadn't done nothing been around the world seven times and he's speaking to a lady one time said i've probably been in front of her spoke to a million people it's like well and i ain't touched but a fraction of that and if brother brown said he hadn't done anything well i sure hadn't done anything but you know i want to be faithful in what god has called us to do amen god bless you tonight amen oh comes ringing or the restless [Music] [Music] the blessed gospel light let it shine from shore to shore send the lights [Music] [Applause] [Music] the light
