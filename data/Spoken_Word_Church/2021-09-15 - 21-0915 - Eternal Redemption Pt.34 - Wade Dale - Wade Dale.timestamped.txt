[6:20] amen
[6:21] god bless you thank you for coming out
[6:23] on a
[6:23] rainy night and
[6:26] it's middle of the week and
[6:28] we just need to recharge
[6:30] our batteries
[6:32] hey man we've been
[6:34] beat on for the past couple of days but
[6:36] we're good
[6:37] good to be back in the harness again
[6:39] good to be back in the house with the
[6:40] lord
[6:41] i told somebody the other day i said
[6:43] those two or three sermons that i set
[6:45] and watched at home i said i don't see
[6:47] how in the world y'all do that
[6:50] i just don't see how you can sit home
[6:52] and watch a service unless you just have
[6:54] to
[6:55] but just to do it because you want to oh
[6:58] i don't know
[6:59] i'm sorry
[7:01] the bible says assemble yourself
[7:02] together so and i know we need to to be
[7:05] careful what we're doing but i'm i'm
[7:07] saying this if that's your habit of
[7:09] doing that i just can't see that
[7:11] it's just not it's just not a church
[7:13] service
[7:14] unless you're here congregated around
[7:17] the word of god with with family
[7:21] church family right
[7:23] by way of announcements let's get those
[7:24] out of the way and then i want to
[7:26] say something just a few minutes
[7:28] about brother uh royale
[7:30] soriano we
[7:32] we
[7:33] miss him already and i
[7:35] i
[7:36] want to tell a little story about
[7:38] um i don't think anyone knows this i
[7:40] think i don't think i've ever told it
[7:42] before
[7:43] but
[7:44] we're still contemplating having
[7:46] putt-putt on friday night so
[7:49] it's supposed to rain and then it's
[7:51] supposed to not rain and it's supposed
[7:53] to be 50 percent chance and then
[7:57] i think maybe if why don't we just
[7:59] postpone it until
[8:02] until another time if it people are sick
[8:05] um
[8:06] brother bob's family may
[8:08] you know if they test positive
[8:10] uh everybody's trying to get over all
[8:12] this and and thank you for your prayers
[8:15] thank god i was one of the fortunate
[8:17] ones i did not have any of the symptoms
[8:19] except that i lost my sense of taste
[8:22] and a little bit of fatigue but no um
[8:25] nothing in my
[8:27] in my lungs or nothing in my no fever
[8:30] and just kind of took it easy and went
[8:32] stir crazy and probably
[8:35] probably stirred june crazy too but
[8:38] but man that quarantined business is for
[8:40] the birds also but um
[8:42] but we thank god that he got us through
[8:44] it and that uh
[8:46] and just continue to pray i've developed
[8:48] a little acid reflux which causes
[8:50] shortness of breath and
[8:52] and um i'm getting over that so i'm
[8:55] watching what i eat and uh but it's i
[8:58] don't know whether it comes from the
[8:59] covet or or people say that sometimes
[9:01] it'll attack a certain party part of
[9:03] your body
[9:05] and um so from right here to about right
[9:07] here burns
[9:08] a lot
[9:10] even if you don't eat anything so i'm
[9:11] trying to see somebody about that but i
[9:13] we need to see the great physician
[9:15] yeah he's he's got all the he's got all
[9:18] the remedies and we're going to turn it
[9:19] over to him so so let's just postpone
[9:22] the putt-putt
[9:24] until everybody can be there again i
[9:26] know there may not be a great time but
[9:28] uh june if you don't mind you'll call
[9:30] her and tell her
[9:32] the situation um we'll just postpone it
[9:35] until a later date also uh this coming
[9:39] sunday will be both services here uh
[9:42] we'll go ahead and continue to mask up
[9:44] and
[9:45] while you're inside the sanctuary
[9:48] um
[9:50] also remember then two weeks from now or
[9:53] two and a half weeks from now the 25th
[9:55] on saturday at 3 o'clock brother andrew
[9:56] glover will be here with
[9:59] we'll have a youth service on that
[10:00] saturday and then regular service
[10:03] on sunday so i think that's about it
[10:05] we'll i'll be doing both services sunday
[10:08] the lord willing so just keep us all in
[10:10] your prayers also i would like to
[10:14] tell this story about brother royale
[10:17] you know he and i went to uh palawan
[10:20] the both times i was in in the
[10:22] philippines and
[10:24] the first time we went we stayed in a in
[10:27] a rather nice motel
[10:29] and um
[10:32] and it kind of was he was like kind of
[10:34] out of his element because he he didn't
[10:37] you know he liked to sleep on a cot i
[10:39] guess or on the floor or wherever so the
[10:42] story that i'm gonna tell you'll see
[10:45] and
[10:46] so the second time
[10:48] we went over there
[10:51] we scheduled another meeting in palawan
[10:53] and we didn't stay in the good motel we
[10:55] stayed in a bungalow
[10:57] a little small place about the size of
[10:59] this
[11:02] pulpit here
[11:04] not much bigger than this pulpit
[11:06] but it only had one bed
[11:09] they didn't have any more they only had
[11:11] one bed
[11:12] and it was a small bed
[11:15] and
[11:16] brother royale with all his
[11:19] um
[11:20] oh sister chichi also told me she said
[11:23] make sure he takes his medicine
[11:25] yeah so ever so i would always make sure
[11:27] he took his medicine well
[11:29] we were getting ready to go to bed the
[11:30] first night and
[11:32] i told brother royle i said look i said
[11:34] you you take the bed
[11:37] you're the oldest in the room
[11:39] and men brother uh the other brother
[11:41] will sleep in the floor
[11:44] he wouldn't have none of that
[11:46] he said no brother he said
[11:48] you're my guest
[11:49] he said
[11:50] you're sleeping on the bed
[11:53] so i think we may have thumb wrestled or
[11:55] something and i and i lost and i kept
[11:57] trying to pull him up into the bed and
[11:59] he wouldn't he laid in that floor and
[12:01] went to sleep that night got up the next
[12:03] morning
[12:04] had to roll himself out of the floor and
[12:07] crawl up on the bed
[12:10] that's the kind of guy he was
[12:12] that's the kind of brother brother royal
[12:13] was he gave his life
[12:16] and i and i pray
[12:18] that um
[12:21] if i could say one more thing to him
[12:23] tonight
[12:25] we tried to make it to mount pinatubo
[12:27] for some of you that don't realize we
[12:29] built a church there
[12:31] we gave several thousand dollars to
[12:32] build a church and we were going to go
[12:34] dedicate it the second time we were
[12:35] there
[12:37] and because of the monsoon season or
[12:39] whatever the rainy season we could not
[12:41] get because you got to cross these
[12:42] rivers that swell up and you can't get
[12:44] across them without a boat and you
[12:46] really have to you rent one of those
[12:48] army jeeps to even try to get across as
[12:50] much as you can so we couldn't make it
[12:54] but that was on our heart to do the next
[12:56] time that if the lord tarried that we
[12:58] were going to
[13:00] go dedicate that church
[13:02] so if i have anything to say to him
[13:04] brother we'll dedicate that church
[13:08] someway somehow we'll dedicate that
[13:10] church if we have to dedicate it in the
[13:12] millennium
[13:15] because that was his desire he wanted to
[13:17] do that so bad and he tried so bad to
[13:19] get
[13:20] to get to to get us away over there and
[13:23] we just couldn't couldn't go but uh
[13:26] he was a real friend
[13:28] he was a real traveling companion
[13:32] and i miss him i i
[13:35] i don't even like to see the pictures
[13:37] they post on facebook because it brings
[13:38] back too many memories
[13:41] because i know he's in a better place
[13:44] we know that but still
[13:47] parting has sweet sorrow
[13:51] and i was glad to walk
[13:53] with that man
[13:54] for the years that i knew him
[13:57] he spent a week or so at our house one
[13:59] time and we had a blast got to really
[14:01] get to know both of them
[14:04] really well and
[14:07] i just know one thing's for sure
[14:10] if anybody made it he made it
[14:15] and i pray
[14:16] that somebody
[14:18] in the philippines
[14:20] will pick up that torch
[14:24] and will be the same
[14:26] can't be the same brother royale
[14:29] but will have that same desire
[14:31] that he had
[14:32] to get the message to the people of the
[14:34] philippines
[14:35] that was his desire and even to
[14:37] different places like hong kong and and
[14:40] dubai he traveled all over the place
[14:44] not sightseeing he's he went there for a
[14:46] on a mission
[14:48] and god said hey
[14:51] i'm finished with you now
[14:54] come and rest
[14:56] let's rest for a little while
[14:58] your labor's done
[15:01] so now please somebody pick that torch
[15:04] up in the philippines
[15:06] and take it to the to the people there
[15:09] through that church there with the
[15:10] overcomers we pray for them
[15:13] that there's a big gap that's got to be
[15:15] filled but you know what
[15:17] god knew that
[15:19] and he's got somebody
[15:21] he's got somebody that'll fill that gap
[15:23] up
[15:24] i just pray that they'll
[15:26] they'll get behind whoever it is
[15:29] and that they'll have that same zeal
[15:31] that brother royal soriano had
[15:33] because he was a real go-getter he was
[15:35] even with all the problems that he had
[15:37] in his body
[15:39] i went through that stroke for a year or
[15:41] so didn't do anything and
[15:43] and he just kept going on and kept going
[15:45] on and kept going on and we we love
[15:47] people like that that just gets up and
[15:49] goes when the devil knocks you down you
[15:51] just get right back up and take off
[15:52] again
[15:53] so we we thank brother royal
[15:56] for all the time i've had with him
[15:59] on the earth
[16:00] and um i'm looking forward to spending
[16:02] an eternity with him
[16:04] and there'll be no sorrow there'll be no
[16:06] sadness there'll be no pain
[16:10] there'll be no tears
[16:13] but he was a good brother and we'll miss
[16:15] him
[16:16] until we meet again
[16:18] i like what they say in jamaica they say
[16:20] until
[16:22] until you say what well until
[16:25] until we either meet in the rapture
[16:26] until we meet
[16:28] whichever you you know we pass on and go
[16:30] over there with him we'll meet again
[16:33] with our brother
[16:34] i believe on this earth
[16:37] and we'll go to mount pinatubo
[16:40] we won't have to do it in a bus
[16:43] we can travel like a thong but god bless
[16:45] you we love you with the love of the
[16:46] lord
[16:47] just keep us all in prayer
[16:49] we all have things that we have that
[16:51] we're trying to deal with with all this
[16:53] uh redo of covid coming back again and
[16:56] and and all these other sicknesses but
[16:59] god's the healer
[17:01] he knew these things were going to
[17:02] happen it's just part of our journey to
[17:06] to to have the right reaction and have
[17:08] the right attitude and have the right
[17:11] mental attitude
[17:13] to take us to the next level where we
[17:14] can get out of here because somebody is
[17:16] going to take this message and get out
[17:18] of here with it amen so we're just going
[17:20] to contend
[17:23] that it's us
[17:24] amen so if you got your bibles let's
[17:26] just we're going to
[17:27] tonight just real short
[17:30] um
[17:31] we're going to just go over something
[17:34] i mean background a little bit since
[17:36] it's been two weeks
[17:38] we just i think brother luis and brother
[17:40] aaron and brother bob for uh taking over
[17:42] while we were all
[17:44] um
[17:45] while we were out they did an
[17:46] outstanding job i think you ought to
[17:47] give them a good hand
[17:52] listen a lot of churches don't have that
[17:54] luxury a lot of churches would have to
[17:55] shut down or they'd have to play a tape
[17:57] or they'd have to bring a minister in
[17:59] but thank god that we've got a
[18:01] uh
[18:02] a stable full of of good horses amen
[18:06] that can uh that can carry this message
[18:08] on
[18:09] and continue on as we go
[18:12] and
[18:13] one more thing before i'm finished i'm
[18:15] not going to call any names but
[18:17] you know we
[18:18] a lot of times this is brother dale's
[18:20] watching in now so i want him to listen
[18:23] to this
[18:24] there's a lot of times that
[18:27] that sometimes we we're preaching our
[18:28] heart out and
[18:31] it seems like you know nobody's getting
[18:33] anything
[18:35] it seems like you know you're trying
[18:36] your best and you're just absolutely
[18:39] have you ever been stuck in gravel
[18:40] you just get stuck in gravel and you're
[18:42] throwing rocks everywhere and you're
[18:44] going nowhere
[18:46] but then when you get a a phone call
[18:50] from
[18:51] somebody that's watched online
[18:55] and they're absolutely rejoicing over
[18:58] the revelation that they got from what
[19:00] brother dale's brought all these years
[19:03] and they're watching and listening to
[19:04] the old sermons that he's preached
[19:08] and you see and you hear the joy in
[19:10] their in their voice
[19:14] and the man all he done was he was
[19:16] searching for truth
[19:19] and god told him to go online
[19:24] god told him he told us what he said
[19:26] god told him to go online and find
[19:29] a true preacher and he found brother
[19:32] dale about six years ago and he's been
[19:34] watching ever since
[19:36] so
[19:37] uh to him and all the other ministers
[19:39] sometimes we we may not be preaching
[19:41] right here to this congregation we're
[19:43] we're preaching to somebody maybe that
[19:46] that i mean this this brother is
[19:48] right in the middle of several message
[19:50] churches but the doctrines are all over
[19:53] the all over the
[19:55] all over the chart and i just thank god
[19:57] that we had a
[19:59] that we had a chance
[20:01] some people don't have a chance
[20:03] we've had a chance but what are we going
[20:04] to do with it what are we going to do
[20:06] about it okay so let's go to hebrews 9
[20:08] 11 i'm going to background just for a
[20:10] few minutes and then we'll go home
[20:11] because i want to finish this up this
[20:14] coming sunday
[20:15] the plan of eternal plan of redemption
[20:19] and then we will
[20:21] start on something else maybe on the son
[20:23] of man
[20:26] so hebrews 9 verse 11 let's pray before
[20:28] we before we get started heavenly father
[20:30] we
[20:31] we thank you lord for this day that you
[20:33] give us
[20:35] we pray lord that
[20:37] will not that as the bible says we'll
[20:39] redeem our time
[20:41] lord that will not waste our time from
[20:43] this day forward
[20:45] lord that will
[20:46] even though it looks like no one is
[20:49] fighting with you
[20:50] somebody is
[20:52] because you got an elect bride
[20:55] you've got a predestinated selected
[20:58] bride that's going to make it
[21:01] she's going to be the crown
[21:04] on your head
[21:06] she's going to be the fulfillment of all
[21:08] your word
[21:10] she's going to be that little
[21:12] armor meat packing
[21:14] girl that little wash woman
[21:20] not those three sisters that jumped
[21:22] around and shouted and screamed and had
[21:24] a big time
[21:25] no that little wash woman that washed
[21:27] the dishes and did her daily duty lord
[21:30] that's what caught your eye
[21:32] and thank god you sent us a prophet to
[21:34] tell us that story to make it so real
[21:37] and lord now we're making ourselves
[21:39] ready lord because we know that
[21:41] very soon

[24:09] hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming
[24:11] high priests of good things to come by a
[24:13] greater and more perfect tabernacle not
[24:15] made with hands that is to say not of
[24:17] this building neither by the blood of
[24:19] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[24:21] entered him once into the holy place
[24:23] having obtained eternal redemption
[24:26] for us let's read isaiah 65 this is what
[24:29] we'll get to sunday but i just want a
[24:30] background just for a minute and i want
[24:32] to bring a little point out and then
[24:34] we'll close isaiah 65 17 for behold
[24:38] i create new heavens
[24:40] and a new earth
[24:42] and the former shall not be remembered
[24:46] nor come into mind you may be seated in
[24:47] the lord as blessing
[24:49] to the reading of the word
[24:51] let's read matthew 25 31 real quick
[24:55] when the son of man shall come in his
[24:57] glory and all the holy angels with him
[24:59] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[25:00] glory
[25:01] and before him shall be gathered all
[25:03] nations and he shall separate them one
[25:05] from another as a shepherd dividing his
[25:07] sheep
[25:08] from the goats now that look the son of
[25:11] man shall come in his glory
[25:13] so now let's go to matthew 16 verse 15.
[25:17] this is where they're talking to jesus
[25:19] he said unto them but whom you say that
[25:21] i am and simon peter said thou art the
[25:23] christ the son of the living god
[25:26] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[25:27] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[25:29] blood hath not revealed it to them but
[25:32] my father which is in heaven and i say
[25:34] unto thee that thou art peter and upon
[25:36] this rock
[25:37] i will build my church in other words
[25:39] this revelation i will build my church
[25:42] now not church nominal
[25:46] jesus's church is his bride
[25:49] all right jesus church he's going to
[25:50] build a bride he's not going to build a
[25:52] church he's going to be not going to
[25:53] build a building he's going to build a
[25:56] bride i will
[25:58] build my church
[26:01] and the gates of hell are going to try
[26:04] but they shall not prevail against him
[26:06] amen i love that
[26:08] so what happened during the church ages
[26:12] is that god was building his church and
[26:14] he was building his church on the
[26:15] foundation of the revelation that the
[26:18] son of god was the creator god but he
[26:22] was also the holy ghost that was going
[26:23] to come back on the day of pentecost and
[26:25] enter into 120 people and start god's
[26:29] church
[26:30] our bride all right so thank god though
[26:33] that there was a prophet coming in the
[26:35] end time that because during the church
[26:37] ages it all kind of got convoluted and
[26:40] it kind of the the vines intertwined and
[26:43] you couldn't tell one from the other and
[26:45] and you call church this and you call
[26:47] this but thank god we had a prophet
[26:49] coming the end time and he said now i
[26:51] call you bride
[26:53] i don't call you church anymore the
[26:55] church is going to go through the
[26:57] tribulation but the bride is not
[27:00] the church is going to go through this
[27:02] it's going to be a denomination it's
[27:03] going to take the mark of the beast but
[27:05] the bride is not
[27:07] so he separated that he took those two
[27:09] vines and he separated them away from
[27:11] each other
[27:12] because they had got so intertwined
[27:14] that there was no revelation no
[27:16] prevailing revelation to get us out of
[27:19] it until god did send a prophet
[27:22] and then when he sent that prophet he
[27:24] divided or took us back to the faith of
[27:26] the fathers and built his church on that
[27:29] and built this bride that we're talking
[27:31] about now the armored meat packing girl
[27:34] the one that gets herself ready
[27:36] the one that's going to
[27:39] finish this whole thing
[27:41] i mean finish it all it's going to be
[27:43] the bride of jesus christ the church is
[27:45] not going to finish the church is going
[27:47] to go through the tribulation the church
[27:49] is going to be persecuted the church is
[27:51] going to be going to go through the
[27:52] battle of armageddon the church is going
[27:54] to die
[27:55] and be left
[27:57] in the fifth dimension or wherever you
[27:58] want to put them at they're going to be
[28:00] left for another thousand years during
[28:02] the millennium that's where the church
[28:03] is going to be
[28:05] because the church turned god down
[28:09] revelations 3 14 all through there he's
[28:12] on the outside
[28:13] the prophet of god outside of the church
[28:17] trying to get back into his own place
[28:19] because he said i'll build my church and
[28:21] he did start building his church
[28:23] but they got to being what false
[28:26] doctrine and all these different things
[28:27] coming in and it got the vines all
[28:30] intertwined together and they took a
[28:31] profit to break them apart and like i
[28:33] said now we can read the bible and we
[28:36] can see where the church has to go
[28:37] through tribulation but the bride does
[28:39] not have to go through tribulation all
[28:41] right so there's the revelation that you
[28:44] and i get in the end time that will help
[28:47] us if we'll be able to see that
[28:49] excuse me
[28:51] that we'll see that the church
[28:55] is not the bride
[28:56] all right so now let's go to revelations
[28:59] 4 1
[29:00] because this is not going to be the
[29:02] church
[29:03] the church does not take
[29:06] the rapture
[29:08] only the bride
[29:10] the church does not take the rapture
[29:13] all right so this is then only talking
[29:16] because brother branham was specific he
[29:18] didn't say john typed the church
[29:22] he said john typed the bride
[29:25] all right john typed the whole bride he
[29:27] did not type the church
[29:30] because in revelations 4 1 said after
[29:32] this i looked and behold the door was
[29:33] opened in heaven and the first voice
[29:35] which i heard was that there were a
[29:36] trumpet talking with me which said come
[29:38] up hither now there's your rapture and
[29:40] that's not
[29:42] the church
[29:44] that's the bride all down through the
[29:46] church ages but it's not the church it's
[29:48] the bride
[29:49] all right and i will show these things
[29:51] which must be hereafter and immediately
[29:53] i was in the spirit and behold the
[29:54] throne was set in heaven and one
[29:57] set on that throne
[29:59] so now immediately after that then the
[30:01] church has got to go through tribulation
[30:03] go to matthew 24 21
[30:06] for then shall be great tribulation
[30:08] brother claude and i were talking about
[30:09] this
[30:10] today you know you look at the bible too
[30:13] and you thank god that we know we don't
[30:14] go through the great tribulation now we
[30:16] go through tribulation
[30:18] because tribulation worketh patience
[30:21] so we'll go through now remember the
[30:23] great tribulation though is the wrath of
[30:26] god poured out on the world
[30:29] and there's no bride here to stop it
[30:33] everybody got that
[30:35] all right for then shall be great
[30:37] tribulation
[30:38] that's the wrath of god that's poured
[30:41] out on the church because she didn't
[30:43] accept god as you and i accepted him as
[30:47] our
[30:48] husband lover whatever you want to call
[30:51] it as jesus christ our savior
[30:54] for there shall be great tribulation
[30:58] such as was not since the beginning of
[30:59] the world to this time
[31:01] now remember
[31:03] he's talking about
[31:05] noah and the flood
[31:08] even such as since the beginning of the
[31:10] world to this time no
[31:12] no ever nor ever shall be
[31:15] and except those days should be
[31:17] shortened there should be no flesh saved
[31:18] but for the elect sake all right who's
[31:21] the elect that's me and you for the
[31:23] elect sake it's going to be shortened so
[31:25] it'll get us out of the way so that god
[31:28] will bring this great tribulation
[31:30] upon the world are
[31:33] the wrath of god all right so let's go
[31:35] to the next one
[31:37] revelations 2 verse 20. notwithstanding
[31:39] i have a few things against thee because
[31:41] thou suffereth that woman jezebel which
[31:43] calls herself a prophetess to teach and
[31:45] seduce my servants to commit fornication
[31:48] now we know what that is that's the
[31:49] church
[31:51] that's the mother that's the
[31:52] mother with the harlots
[31:55] to teach and seduce my servants to
[31:56] commit fornication and to eat things
[31:58] sacrificed into idols and i give her
[32:00] space to repent two thousand years to
[32:03] repent of her fornication and she
[32:05] repented not behold i will cast her into
[32:08] a bed and then that committeth adultery
[32:10] with her into
[32:12] great tribulation
[32:14] see there great tribulation except they
[32:17] repented their deeds and we know that
[32:19] maybe some did but we know that there
[32:21] was a group that did not
[32:22] because that group is going to be in the
[32:24] lake of fire and that group is going to
[32:27] be not here during the thousand-year
[32:29] millennial reign so let's go to
[32:30] revelations 13 4
[32:33] and they worship the dragon which gave
[32:35] power unto the beast and they worshipped
[32:36] the beast saying who is likened to the
[32:38] beast who is able to make war with him
[32:40] and there was given unto him a mouth
[32:42] speaking great things and blasphemies
[32:44] and power was given unto him to continue
[32:46] 42 months now we're over into the
[32:49] part of daniel 70 weeks all right when
[32:50] we're already gone and he opened his
[32:53] mouth and blasphemed me against god to
[32:54] blaspheme his name his tabernacle and
[32:57] then that dwell in heaven
[32:59] pretty mad guy huh and it was given unto
[33:01] him to make war with the saints and to
[33:03] overcome them and power was given unto
[33:06] all kindred and tongue and nations all
[33:08] right and all that dwell upon the earth
[33:10] shall worship him
[33:11] whose names are not written in the book
[33:13] of life of the lamb slain from the
[33:14] foundation
[33:15] of the world thank god for a prophet to
[33:17] tell us though that there's a there's a
[33:19] lamb's book of life and then there's an
[33:20] eternal section
[33:22] there's a section that your name can be
[33:23] transferred from there's a section that
[33:25] your name can be wiped out of and then
[33:27] there's a section that your name can
[33:28] never be wiped out of amen if you're
[33:30] bride of jesus christ you're on the
[33:32] lounge book of life the eternal section
[33:34] you cannot be erased off of that you
[33:37] can't blaspheme the holy ghost if you've
[33:39] got the holy ghost
[33:40] amen but some people are going to do
[33:43] that and they're going to worship this
[33:44] person
[33:46] they're going to worship this person the
[33:48] whole earth
[33:49] all that dwell on the earth shall
[33:52] worship him
[33:53] no are they thinking they're worshiping
[33:55] the devil
[33:59] no they think they're worshiping god
[34:01] but he's deceived them but who is not
[34:04] going to be deceived me and you
[34:07] you and i
[34:08] if you've got the baptism of the holy
[34:10] ghost today you cannot be deceived
[34:13] that's right amen
[34:15] you can you can be in a little bit of
[34:17] deception
[34:18] but you can't be deceived enough to
[34:20] blaspheme and you definitely can't be
[34:22] you cannot be
[34:24] deceived enough to follow after this guy
[34:27] okay
[34:28] so there's that separation part
[34:32] that we were looking at now look let's
[34:34] go to revelations 11 3.
[34:36] and i want to bring something out after
[34:38] i get here in the daniel and then we'll
[34:40] close and i'll start back over sunday
[34:43] so i will give power to my two witnesses
[34:45] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[34:46] hundred and three score days closing
[34:48] sackcloth now who are these that's the
[34:50] moses and elijah the spirit of moses and
[34:53] the spirit of elijah and two prophets
[34:55] that are over in israel we're already
[34:57] gone the bride is in heaven
[35:00] the church is on earth
[35:03] the church is being persecuted at this
[35:05] time the bride is in glory
[35:07] and then god has a group of people are a
[35:10] remnant
[35:12] servants
[35:14] which is the 144 000 that's got to be
[35:17] called out during this 1260 days
[35:21] everybody got that say ma'am
[35:23] now i want you to keep this in the back
[35:25] of your mind
[35:27] that those two prophets
[35:30] they will open
[35:33] the sixth seal and we'll talk about that
[35:34] in just a minute
[35:36] it says these are the two olive trees
[35:38] and the two candlesticks standing before
[35:40] the god of the earth
[35:41] so let's go to daniel 9 24.
[35:44] the 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[35:46] people who is that the jews
[35:48] and upon thy holy city jerusalem
[35:51] to do six things finish transgression
[35:53] make an end of sins make reconciliation
[35:55] for iniquity bringing everlasting
[35:57] righteousness
[35:58] seal up the vision and prophecy into the
[36:00] north the most holy so it's going to
[36:02] take 490 years
[36:04] for god to send enough
[36:07] i say send enough prophets and send
[36:09] enough preachers and send two witnesses
[36:13] it's going to take 120 i mean 490 years
[36:16] 7 7 is 490.
[36:18] 70 weeks
[36:19] it's going to take 490 years to bring
[36:21] israel back now it's not a continual 490
[36:24] years we know that 483's already passed
[36:28] then there was calvary
[36:31] jesus was crucified
[36:33] so that cut off the gen the jews we've
[36:36] covered this before in the beginning of
[36:37] this and then god started dealing with
[36:39] the gentiles but he's not going to
[36:41] forget israel he's going to come right
[36:43] back in that last week and he's going to
[36:46] reconcile
[36:47] israel to him call out 144 000 and
[36:52] they're going now listen 144 000 is
[36:54] going to be called out during that time
[36:55] all right
[36:56] now but
[36:58] all hell's going to be breaking loose
[36:59] everywhere else
[37:01] everybody got that
[37:03] it's going to be worldwide and it's
[37:05] going to work its way over to jerusalem
[37:07] and then you've got the two witnesses
[37:10] that break that sixth seal open but now
[37:12] remember
[37:13] they break it open
[37:15] in its pure form according to the bible
[37:20] but now there has to be a six seal
[37:22] part that you and i get of
[37:24] sanctification
[37:26] that we'll talk about in just a minute
[37:28] and then i'll then we'll then we'll
[37:30] leave brother claude and i were talking
[37:31] about this so i thought i'd cover it
[37:33] and then we'll uh we'll get back to it
[37:35] sunday
[37:36] so let's go to jeremiah
[37:39] 30 verse 7.
[37:42] now what's happening here is is that god
[37:45] is going to
[37:47] promise israel
[37:50] two things
[37:53] for a surety
[37:54] he's going to save them
[37:57] and he's going to have somebody sit on
[37:59] the throne of david
[38:01] ruling the 12 tribes of israel he's
[38:03] promised this to israel israel knows
[38:06] that
[38:08] but watch this alas for that day is
[38:10] great so that none is like it it is even
[38:12] the time of jacob's trouble
[38:15] but he shall be saved out of it all
[38:18] right for it shall come to pass in that
[38:20] day saith the lord of hosts that i will
[38:22] break his yoke from off thy neck and
[38:24] will burst thy bonds and strangers shall
[38:26] no more serve themselves
[38:28] of him in other words the whole world is
[38:30] after israel
[38:33] they they're probably 50 of the people
[38:35] in this whole world would love to see
[38:37] israel just vanish
[38:40] right
[38:42] but he's not going to do that
[38:46] but they shall serve the lord their god
[38:48] and david their king
[38:50] whom i will raise up unto them now
[38:53] remember it's not david himself it's
[38:55] the lineage of david which is where
[38:57] jesus christ comes through the lineage
[38:59] of david it's not david we're not going
[39:01] to see david sitting on the throne
[39:03] ruling the 12 tribes of israel in the
[39:05] millennium we're going to see jesus
[39:07] christ but he's the son of david by
[39:10] faith
[39:11] all right
[39:12] therefore fear thou not o my servant
[39:14] jacob
[39:15] saith the lord neither be dismayed o
[39:17] israel for lo i will save thee from afar
[39:21] and thy seed from the land of their
[39:24] captivity
[39:25] remember israel is
[39:27] israel's starting to come back
[39:29] but
[39:30] he's going to bring them all back
[39:33] and watch
[39:35] and jacob shall return and shall be in
[39:38] rest
[39:39] and be quiet
[39:42] and none shall make him afraid
[39:45] for i am with thee saith the lord to
[39:47] save thee
[39:49] though i make full end of all nations
[39:51] now look
[39:52] he's going to make an end
[39:54] of all nations this against israel
[39:57] though i make a full end of all nations
[39:59] whether i have scattered thee
[40:02] he told him he's going to scatter them
[40:03] remember we read that before he told him
[40:05] you're i'm going to scatter you because
[40:07] you can't be in this land and do the
[40:09] things you're doing
[40:12] but when you decide
[40:13] that you want to do the things that you
[40:15] that i want you to do i'm going to bring
[40:17] you back into this land and it was
[40:19] really strange
[40:22] i guess not really strange it was really
[40:25] the providence of god that the very
[40:28] the very next day that when israel
[40:30] declared their self a nation that the
[40:32] angel of the lord was right there in
[40:34] that cave giving brother branham his
[40:36] commission
[40:38] i don't know if you knew that or not but
[40:39] the very day
[40:42] and then the next day he said the angel
[40:44] appeared to me and gave me my commission
[40:46] that's 1947 or somewhere in there 40
[40:48] whatever year they became a nation
[40:52] that
[40:53] but then what did brother brown say he
[40:55] said they started returning back
[40:57] they've been returning back ever since
[41:00] jews know they got to get in their
[41:02] homeland for god to talk to them right
[41:04] all right for i am with thee saith the
[41:06] lord to save thee though i make a full
[41:08] end of all nations whether i have
[41:10] scattered thee yet will i not make a
[41:12] full end of thee
[41:14] but i will correct thee and measure what
[41:16] daniel 9 24.
[41:18] i will correct you in measure and will
[41:21] not leave thee all together and punish
[41:22] listen
[41:23] he's punished israel
[41:26] he's been punished in israel since they
[41:28] hung him on a cross
[41:30] because they said let his blood be on us
[41:31] and our children
[41:33] so there's been a mark there that god
[41:35] has scattered them dispersed them he's
[41:38] not let them back in the homeland
[41:41] and
[41:41] people hate jews
[41:45] i mean they're the one of the most hated
[41:47] small group of people in the whole world
[41:50] why
[41:51] because they say they're god's people
[41:55] and they are but not all of them
[41:58] amen same way with me and you not all
[42:00] not all israel is israel as we were
[42:03] discussing yesterday afternoon not all
[42:05] israel is israel
[42:07] but be not dismayed though i make full
[42:09] end of all nations whether i have
[42:10] scattered thee
[42:12] yet will i make full a full end of thee
[42:15] but i will i will not make a full entity
[42:17] but i will correct then measure and will
[42:19] not leave the altogether unpunished
[42:21] let's go to revelation 6 verse 12.
[42:26] this is where i want to get to right
[42:27] here and then we'll uh
[42:29] then we'll stop
[42:31] revelation 6 verse 12 says look i beheld
[42:33] and when he had opened the sixth seal
[42:36] now
[42:38] to not make it to where we have to get
[42:40] into a great big
[42:41] discussion i know some that have been
[42:43] here for a long time
[42:45] they've heard the seals over and over
[42:47] again how brother dale preached them
[42:50] and how that um
[42:52] that we know that the seals do not break
[42:54] while we're here
[42:57] okay they break
[42:59] this seal right here will not break
[43:02] until we're gone right
[43:04] okay
[43:05] but we but why did brother branham
[43:06] preach it if we didn't need it
[43:09] so we have to get remember
[43:12] from revelations brother brown said
[43:14] revelations 4 1 to revelations 19 1 19
[43:18] whatever 21
[43:20] is not to the gentiles
[43:22] right
[43:23] but we've been all in it through this
[43:25] whole discussion we've been all through
[43:26] it we read the scriptures we've been
[43:28] reading well there's revelation 6. what
[43:30] do we do in revelation 6 if we didn't
[43:32] need it right as the gentiles
[43:35] so thank god for a prophet and thank god
[43:37] for a for a pastor that saw that there
[43:40] was a spiritual meaning of these seals
[43:43] that had to open to the bride first
[43:46] in a spiritual form
[43:49] and then the natural form would open all
[43:51] right so look this is what's going to
[43:53] happen
[43:54] and beheld when i he had opened the
[43:56] sixth seal and lo there was a great
[43:58] earthquake and the sun became black a
[44:00] sack cloth of hair and the moon became
[44:02] his blood and the stars of heaven fell
[44:04] into the earth
[44:06] and even as a fig tree casters are
[44:07] untimely figs when she is shaking of a
[44:09] mighty wind and the heavens departed as
[44:12] a scroll when it was rolled together
[44:13] atomic
[44:14] and every mountain and island were moved
[44:16] out of their places
[44:18] and the kings of the earth and the great
[44:19] men the rich men the chief captains and
[44:22] the mighty men every bondman and every
[44:24] free man hid themselves in the dens and
[44:26] in the rocks of the mountains and said
[44:28] to the mountains and rocks fall on us
[44:30] and hide us from the face of him that
[44:31] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[44:32] of the lamb for the great day of his
[44:34] wrath see that's the wrath of god
[44:37] poured out upon a world that doesn't
[44:40] have the bride in it
[44:43] now it does have 144 000 still there and
[44:45] it does have the the the foolish virgin
[44:48] and and all those different ones but
[44:50] they're giving their life for what they
[44:52] believe but god is pouring out these on
[44:56] on the
[44:58] the ball of earth the earth not this
[45:00] earth he's literally pouring this out on
[45:03] the earth
[45:04] those two prophets brother brown said
[45:07] open that sixth seal any time they want
[45:09] to
[45:10] because remember what was the
[45:12] characteristics when we read there
[45:14] in revelations 11
[45:16] and
[45:19] it says fire proceeded out of their
[45:21] mouth
[45:23] water was turned to blood
[45:26] it didn't rain for so many years
[45:29] what is that that's them controlling
[45:31] nature
[45:32] the physical part of nature
[45:35] so now and and then watch though and
[45:37] let's read
[45:42] what happens now
[45:44] in revelations
[45:46] for the great day of his wrath let's
[45:48] read that the last one for the great day
[45:50] of his wrath has come and who shall be
[45:52] able to stand now listen that's not me
[45:54] or you
[45:56] but who's going to be able to stand
[45:57] revelation 7 verse 1 this will be the
[45:59] people that's going to stand and after
[46:01] these things i saw four angels standing
[46:02] on the four corners of the earth holding
[46:04] the four winds of the earth that the
[46:06] wind should not blow on the earth nor on
[46:08] the sea nor on any tree and i saw
[46:10] another angel sin from the east having
[46:13] the seal of the living god now what is
[46:15] the seal of the living god
[46:18] the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:20] that's the only seal there is
[46:23] we know there's seven seals and there's
[46:24] all we talk about seal there's only one
[46:26] seal
[46:28] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[46:29] whereby you are
[46:31] sealed unto the day of your redemption
[46:34] so this angel is bringing the seal
[46:39] now listen
[46:42] is that to us
[46:44] we're not here
[46:46] we've already been sealed
[46:49] okay
[46:50] now look the 100 i mean the the foolish
[46:53] virgin they don't get sealed that's the
[46:55] reason they're still here
[46:57] are they okay with this
[46:59] that's the reason the foolish virgin is
[47:01] still here
[47:03] they're not sealed in
[47:04] they don't get this seal because they're
[47:06] under the gentile dispensation which has
[47:09] been closed
[47:10] so who is this talking about only one
[47:12] group of people can receive the holy
[47:14] ghost after
[47:16] the bride leaves the earth
[47:19] and who is it it's going to tell you
[47:20] right here
[47:22] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[47:23] four angels to whom was given to hurt
[47:25] the earth says hurt not the earth
[47:27] neither the sea nor the trees till we
[47:29] have sealed
[47:30] the servants
[47:33] not the bride
[47:35] we have sealed the
[47:36] servants of our god in their foreheads
[47:40] all right
[47:41] remember everybody else that didn't get
[47:43] this seal
[47:45] were sealed in the forehead with the 666
[47:48] right
[47:48] which is not a stamp it's just a number
[47:51] of men
[47:52] all right
[47:53] it's their doctrine and i heard the
[47:55] number of them which were sealed and
[47:57] there were still 140 and 4 000 of all
[48:01] the tribes of the children of israel
[48:03] everybody got that
[48:05] so what's going to happen is
[48:07] he's going to hold the war the last war
[48:10] the war
[48:12] to hurt the earth and the sea
[48:15] and he's not going to hurt that place
[48:17] over there
[48:18] until these people are sealed in
[48:21] now i want to ask you a question though
[48:23] and we'll not read it
[48:25] we'll wait till this till sunday but
[48:28] what happens after the two witnesses
[48:31] preach and after the 144th now listen
[48:34] they're not all going to be sealed i
[48:35] don't think at the same time because
[48:37] then they could just do it in a day now
[48:38] the bible says israel be born in a day
[48:41] but why is he going to give them
[48:44] 1260 days
[48:46] to preach
[48:47] if it's not going to be like me and you
[48:48] we didn't all come in at the same time
[48:52] you saw it
[48:53] he didn't
[48:55] then he saw it and somebody else didn't
[48:57] you understand what i'm saying so it's
[48:59] going to take 1260 days to bring that
[49:02] 144 to seal them in well during that
[49:05] time what's going to happen
[49:07] there's going to be a sick seal that two
[49:09] prophets stand on the earth and they
[49:12] call fire they call the
[49:15] the stars to fall from heaven whatever
[49:17] they call
[49:19] the prophet of god says it's a total
[49:21] disruption of nature
[49:25] and it's controlled by two men
[49:29] it's controlled by two men
[49:32] now
[49:33] where do they get that power
[49:36] from the holy ghost
[49:39] the same holy ghost you got in you today
[49:44] same holy ghost there's not there's not
[49:46] different holy ghost now there's a holy
[49:48] ghost that goes into a gentile bride
[49:50] like we said before that does not make
[49:52] us remnant it makes us sons and
[49:53] daughters of god that is position
[49:56] everybody got that but it's not a
[49:58] different holy ghost it's the same holy
[50:00] ghost
[50:01] so now i want to ask you a question so
[50:04] after they're sealed in what happens to
[50:07] them
[50:09] now the bible says they had to be killed
[50:11] with the two witnesses
[50:12] now it's not in their verbatim that 144
[50:15] 000 are killed but the bible says the
[50:17] two witnesses are killed
[50:20] right and then they take a rapture with
[50:22] the prophet of god tells us that the 144
[50:25] and go in a rapture
[50:28] after they're killed
[50:30] because remember they're not bribed
[50:32] so they can't take a body change down
[50:34] here you and i have already done that
[50:37] they have to be killed for what they
[50:38] believe and then they're re they're
[50:41] raised up as the two witnesses are
[50:43] raised up after three and a half days
[50:45] the two witnesses are raised up
[50:47] and then i believe they're raised up too
[50:49] because listen the whole world's not
[50:50] going to just hate the two witnesses
[50:53] they're gonna hate that 144 000
[50:56] because they're going to be able to do
[50:57] what the two witnesses do
[51:00] now my whole point for tonight is is
[51:02] look that's the same holy ghost you and
[51:04] i have
[51:09] so it means that you and i have to have
[51:11] a sixth seal purging right
[51:15] that's right
[51:16] not a six seal purging of the earth
[51:20] this
[51:20] earth
[51:22] a six seal
[51:24] total disruption of your nature
[51:28] and what is the disruption of your
[51:29] nature
[51:33] everything you were born with is
[51:35] contrary to god
[51:39] everything you were born with is
[51:41] contrary to god that's why as we were
[51:44] talking last night just a group so some
[51:46] people about uh people believing that
[51:49] you had this eternal seed inside of you
[51:51] how are you going to have an eternal
[51:52] seed inside of you and you are born
[51:53] contrary to god
[51:57] now god knows when you're going to get
[51:58] it and he has the eternal seed which is
[52:00] the eternal word
[52:02] but you were born in sin
[52:04] you were born dead
[52:06] you can't do them things you didn't have
[52:08] the holy ghost inside of you
[52:12] and as we were talking last night some
[52:14] people say well it's laying there
[52:16] dormant how can an eternal seed be
[52:17] dormant
[52:23] i'm i'm a dumb country boy but
[52:25] that don't add up
[52:27] but you have an eternal seed inside of
[52:29] you but it's laying dormant
[52:33] now
[52:34] let me ask you a question
[52:38] did mary
[52:39] have a dormant seed inside of her
[52:42] or did god plant that seed inside of her
[52:44] to have the baby jesus
[52:48] you tell me
[52:50] was it just something laying there
[52:51] dormant inside of mary just waiting for
[52:54] the holy ghost to speak
[52:56] no
[52:57] i believe gabriel said the holy ghost
[53:00] will overshadow you
[53:02] and you will have a conception not by a
[53:05] man
[53:06] but by the man
[53:08] amen
[53:10] and there'll be a seed placed inside of
[53:12] you the seed of the woman
[53:18] you see how convoluted people get things
[53:21] but now you have the quotes where
[53:22] brother brown said you know he could say
[53:24] that that you have have this little you
[53:25] know
[53:26] there's one where brother brown said it
[53:28] starts out as a little button
[53:30] but if you'll read that quote he said
[53:32] when you get the holy ghost
[53:34] it starts out as that button what you've
[53:37] received something
[53:40] when jesus said receive you the holy
[53:41] ghost they didn't get it right there
[53:45] no
[53:46] now if they had an eternal seed laying
[53:48] there and the very person the very word
[53:50] of god
[53:51] said receive you the holy ghost
[53:54] what stopped that thing from giving them
[53:56] the holy ghost right then because they
[53:58] didn't have it
[54:00] it wasn't there for them to have
[54:02] jesus hadn't died yet
[54:04] to release that life
[54:06] to release the holy ghost
[54:09] so this sixth seal
[54:11] is very important
[54:13] for you and me
[54:15] because listen
[54:16] what happens after the actual sixth seal
[54:19] opens
[54:22] there's a rapture
[54:26] there's a rapture after the sixth seal
[54:28] opens
[54:32] when you and i when that sixth seal
[54:34] breaks to us
[54:36] and it totally disrupts our nature
[54:39] and turns our nature to that
[54:42] there'll be a rapture
[54:44] that's what you want to know what's
[54:45] holding the rapture off i'm holding it
[54:47] off because i hadn't got the divine all
[54:49] the divine nature of god
[54:51] inside of me
[54:54] and then the headstone which is the
[54:55] seventh seal which is him himself
[55:00] comes and fulfills itself because
[55:01] remember when we take the sixth seal let
[55:04] me ask you a question also
[55:07] because the bible says that after
[55:10] that the
[55:12] two witnesses and the sixth seal opens
[55:15] they just absolutely just turned the
[55:16] world upside down
[55:18] they're killed 144 000 are killed
[55:20] they're taken up in a rapture now daniel
[55:23] tells us that michael
[55:26] will now come on the scene and fight for
[55:29] israel
[55:32] maybe during the battle of armageddon i
[55:34] don't know
[55:36] but it calls michael which is who christ
[55:41] christ is those seals
[55:44] so if we'll get that where will you you
[55:46] say well now
[55:47] what are you talking about we need a
[55:49] sixth seal persian to get christ on the
[55:51] scene
[55:53] now we know we have him in the new birth
[55:55] but we don't have him in the headstone
[55:57] yet
[55:58] we don't have the fullness yet we're
[56:00] working toward that that's what's
[56:02] keeping us here
[56:03] but we need to look at that and see that
[56:06] we need a house cleaning
[56:08] we need a sick seal purging of all the
[56:10] things that we used to do
[56:12] you say well brother i've been born
[56:14] again and i don't have no this and that
[56:16] and the other and this and that and the
[56:17] other yeah well you might have not have
[56:19] that this and that and the other but you
[56:21] maybe you got something else coming
[56:23] maybe you got something else that you
[56:24] need to shake out get shook out of your
[56:26] house
[56:28] but that sick seal purging
[56:30] will purge a literal earth
[56:35] it'll purge a little earth
[56:37] but you and i it's going to purge our
[56:39] earth first
[56:42] because remember adam fell
[56:45] then the earth fell
[56:47] under him
[56:49] so now what is the world waiting for
[56:51] groaning and waiting for what
[56:53] the manifestation of the sons of god
[56:57] now listen the world's not waiting on
[56:59] this group right here
[57:04] this group's waiting on us
[57:07] but the whole world's not waiting on
[57:08] them to manifest who they are first
[57:11] the whole world's waiting on me and you
[57:13] to manifest who we are first
[57:15] according to romans 8 waiting for the
[57:17] manifestation i was reading the other
[57:19] day in the future home brother brown was
[57:21] somebody was saying quoting to him that
[57:23] we needed manifested sons of god in the
[57:26] millennium he said
[57:28] why do we need them in the millennium
[57:29] for
[57:30] why do we need healing in the millennium
[57:32] we don't need that
[57:33] we need it now
[57:35] they got the cart before the horse
[57:38] so you and i must realize that we have
[57:40] to have that same purging you know we're
[57:43] going through this eternal plan of
[57:44] redemption
[57:46] and we had to bring the seals into it
[57:48] somewhere
[57:49] because the seals is the total plan of
[57:51] redemption
[57:52] so now when six seals finish his
[57:54] redemption who comes on the scene
[57:57] christ
[57:58] so when the sixth seal
[58:00] finishes here and they're carried away
[58:03] who comes on the scene michael
[58:06] who comes on the scene christ remember
[58:08] what is the seventh seal it's the same
[58:10] as the seventh trumpet which is the
[58:12] kingdoms of this world
[58:14] have become the kingdoms of our lord and
[58:16] his christ
[58:17] which will be in the millennium
[58:20] after all this is done and over with so
[58:22] that was my point i wanted to bring
[58:24] because me and brother claude were
[58:25] talking about yesterday or today
[58:27] yesterday and today
[58:29] and
[58:30] that sixth seal's got a lot to do with
[58:33] us still being here
[58:38] because it's our nature that's got to be
[58:40] our nature has to be changed and even
[58:41] paul says having the mind of christ and
[58:44] and and all these things and do we
[58:47] that's my question tonight
[58:49] do we have the mind of christ yeah we're
[58:51] born again and yes we do have the mind
[58:53] of christ but boy i'm telling you my
[58:55] mind ain't all christ
[58:58] my physical brain don't think things it
[59:00] should think
[59:02] as far as christ is concerned but what
[59:04] we got to do though is is deny those
[59:06] things
[59:09] cast down those imaginations
[59:12] cast down those fears
[59:14] you say well they're real yeah i know
[59:16] they're real but you got to cast them
[59:19] down
[59:22] to become the stature of a perfect man
[59:25] that the six seal sanctification
[59:28] is going to absolutely not just me we
[59:32] were talking about this this um
[59:34] to that group the other night
[59:36] and and they've never seen it this way i
[59:38] don't think but you know they say well
[59:40] well you know i need to divorce all
[59:42] these things
[59:45] you know i need to get rid of this old
[59:46] husband
[59:48] if you divorce
[59:50] and your husband's alive
[59:53] you're living in adultery right
[59:56] bible
[59:57] right
[59:58] but now if sisters if your husband
[1:00:01] dies
[1:00:04] dies
[1:00:05] you're free to marry
[1:00:08] only in the lord
[1:00:10] but you understand what i'm saying
[1:00:14] you can't divorce them old things that
[1:00:16] you're dealing with
[1:00:20] you got to have them
[1:00:22] killed
[1:00:24] they got to die
[1:00:26] you can't hang them up in a closet and
[1:00:28] use them when you need them because you
[1:00:30] can't what you can't be married to two
[1:00:32] men at the same time according to the
[1:00:34] bible
[1:00:36] one of them's got to be dead right
[1:00:38] so all these things that we've got
[1:00:41] hidden in our closet
[1:00:44] you just divorced it you all you've done
[1:00:46] was just hit it
[1:00:48] i'm saying all of us
[1:00:50] those things have got to die now once
[1:00:53] they die christ says okay i can marry
[1:00:55] you now
[1:00:57] okay i can fill you with these faith
[1:00:59] virtual knowledge temper spaces
[1:01:00] godliness brother kindness
[1:01:03] thank god we've been taught right
[1:01:06] thank god that is important
[1:01:09] and that's part of the seal that's the
[1:01:10] sixth seal sanctification
[1:01:13] that right there
[1:01:16] one two three four five six
[1:01:19] then christ comes on the scene the holy
[1:01:21] listen god's waiting on that thing to
[1:01:24] seal us in that's not a different holy
[1:01:26] ghost
[1:01:28] that's waiting on him to fill the cracks
[1:01:30] up
[1:01:31] because we might have a divorce
[1:01:34] when we need a death
[1:01:37] that's my whole point i want us to
[1:01:39] realize
[1:01:40] everything has got to have a death
[1:01:43] involved with it
[1:01:45] remember what i tell you redemption
[1:01:50] is based on resurrection right
[1:01:54] and to have a resurrection
[1:01:56] something had to die
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] jesus christ had to die
[1:02:02] and be resurrected to come back
[1:02:05] in the hearts of believer
[1:02:07] now we've got people that have passed on
[1:02:09] literally and they passed on but they're
[1:02:11] not dead
[1:02:14] and we're waiting on resurrection
[1:02:16] to bring it right back to where it's
[1:02:18] supposed to be but now listen we don't
[1:02:21] want a resurrection of that old person
[1:02:25] we don't want a divorce
[1:02:28] we don't want a separation some people
[1:02:30] just like separation
[1:02:32] we don't want separation
[1:02:34] we want a death
[1:02:36] that's why i say is as we go to the
[1:02:38] water to baptize we're going to a
[1:02:41] funeral
[1:02:42] if we're not going to a funeral you're
[1:02:44] just going to get wet
[1:02:47] but if you bury that thing
[1:02:50] and it die
[1:02:53] and you come up in newness of life
[1:02:57] there's that sick seal starting to work
[1:02:59] on you there's that nature that god's
[1:03:01] trying to put in there
[1:03:04] because remember the prophet of god said
[1:03:06] you're born with a nature
[1:03:10] contrary to god right
[1:03:12] your whole nature is contrary to god
[1:03:16] everything you did
[1:03:17] is contrary to god
[1:03:22] so let's let that as we see this as
[1:03:24] we'll stop here
[1:03:27] we'll just sing a couple of songs and
[1:03:28] then we'll be dismissed
[1:03:31] we see this sixth seal opening
[1:03:34] after we're gone from here
[1:03:37] but we got to bring that thing back to
[1:03:38] us
[1:03:40] to where we had a prophet come in the
[1:03:42] end time
[1:03:44] see we didn't need moses and elijah
[1:03:48] jews needed moses and elijah because
[1:03:50] they need those two prophets because
[1:03:52] that's what the bible said
[1:03:54] we needed a malachi 4 prophet
[1:03:57] one prophet one gentile prophet to tell
[1:04:00] us these things and to open the seals to
[1:04:03] show us a way back
[1:04:06] that our old husband is dead not
[1:04:08] divorced
[1:04:10] and that this is not
[1:04:12] us
[1:04:13] remember there was a doctrine brother
[1:04:15] brown said a campbell lights or somebody
[1:04:17] they thought the 144 000 was the bride
[1:04:20] and that's all there was going to be
[1:04:23] somebody had to teach that right amen so
[1:04:26] thank god that we've had the right kind
[1:04:28] of teaching
[1:04:30] because you know brother branham takes
[1:04:32] them uh now we may we may read it next
[1:04:35] week
[1:04:36] where the bible says in revelation i
[1:04:38] think 14 it says there was an you just
[1:04:40] couldn't number this group of people
[1:04:42] and they asked john said who is this and
[1:04:44] john said i don't know thou knowest why
[1:04:46] because it wasn't john's people john is
[1:04:48] a jew
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:51] and he said it's nations many tongues
[1:04:53] nations and people that's the bride
[1:04:55] that's me and you let's stand to our
[1:04:58] feet
[1:05:01] we need that nature change
[1:05:04] and it took a profit to prophesy over us
[1:05:07] to tell us we can have that nature
[1:05:10] change
[1:05:11] come on brother boy we can have that
[1:05:13] nature change we can have those seals
[1:05:16] open
[1:05:17] in a spiritual form to change this body
[1:05:22] because see
[1:05:26] without the statue of perfect man
[1:05:29] you can't have a body change
[1:05:32] without having these virtues working in
[1:05:34] your life and knowing what happens in
[1:05:37] each stage in each condition
[1:05:39] and that capstone being not filial love
[1:05:42] but agape love which is the love of god
[1:05:46] then we're not going to get out of here
[1:05:47] that's why we're still here
[1:05:49] but thank god we've had a prophet and
[1:05:50] we've had a um
[1:05:52] a five-fold ministry to teach us these
[1:05:54] things but just think on these things
[1:05:57] we need an
[1:05:59] interruption of our nature
[1:06:02] i mean man we i sat there for a week and
[1:06:05] and uh tried to do this and i studied a
[1:06:08] good bit in the word of god read a
[1:06:09] couple of books and
[1:06:11] and studied a little bit
[1:06:13] and i thought my
[1:06:15] this is sure is a change because see i
[1:06:18] work and then we come to church and then
[1:06:21] you know you got you get in a routine
[1:06:22] you get in the pattern you get in a rut
[1:06:25] and then you get
[1:06:26] totally disrupted from that what happens
[1:06:29] it disrupts your whole nature
[1:06:31] it just changes everything you got
[1:06:33] well maybe this thing is good for us to
[1:06:35] have a change to know that we gotta
[1:06:36] depend on god
[1:06:39] we gotta depend on god not depend on the
[1:06:42] doctors or depend on that shot or depend
[1:06:44] on whatever we got to depend on god
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:48] now god gives us doctors and he gives us
[1:06:49] shots you understand i'm not neither
[1:06:52] neither way but i'm telling you we got
[1:06:54] to know who we are
[1:06:56] just like brother branham was standing
[1:06:57] he said now this is the church and this
[1:06:59] is the bride you better realize this is
[1:07:01] who you are right here that's right
[1:07:04] not this over here well i'm just going
[1:07:06] to be a good church member
[1:07:08] well
[1:07:10] you're going to go through the
[1:07:11] tribulation
[1:07:12] the wrath of god
[1:07:14] not just the wrath of man that's the
[1:07:16] wrath of god poured out on a nation or
[1:07:18] nations that turn against israel
[1:07:21] then the battle of armageddon and then
[1:07:23] you're not going to be able to live for
[1:07:24] another thousand years until that
[1:07:26] thousand years is over and you've got to
[1:07:28] come up to the white throne judgment
[1:07:29] you've got to give an account on what
[1:07:30] you've done
[1:07:33] thank god
[1:07:35] by the baptism of the holy ghost you
[1:07:37] never have to do that
[1:07:39] you never have to stand the judgment
[1:07:41] you've already you're standing it right
[1:07:43] now
[1:07:44] you've been judged worthy
[1:07:47] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[1:07:48] pleased to dwell that's what jesus said
[1:07:51] or the father said to jesus well that's
[1:07:53] the same thing happened to you when you
[1:07:54] get the new birth
[1:07:57] he's pleased to dwell in you or he
[1:07:59] wouldn't have picked you
[1:08:03] let's sing a song
[1:08:04] 705.
[1:08:07] sing a song just for a moment and then
[1:08:08] we'll dismiss
[1:08:10] you have long for sweet peace
[1:08:14] and have faith
[1:08:16] to increase
[1:08:18] and evernessly
[1:08:21] fervently pray
[1:08:25] but you
[1:08:25] cannot have rest
[1:08:28] or be
