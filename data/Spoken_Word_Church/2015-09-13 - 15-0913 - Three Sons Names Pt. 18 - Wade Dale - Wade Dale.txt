TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you're Rebecca no that's fine Bob's not here to Bob not getting straight all right here we go now all right hey look a loop Merkel Lucas is becoming 30 years old everyone a real well thank you because that's all you in the Boogaloo the Bible says Jesus becoming 30 goes to the river and his baptized now he did not need to receive the Holy Ghost he was born the son of man God in human flesh we know that night so so he look what did he receive he received an anointing for his ministry right now there's a lot of confusion with that but see that's another subject that we've already covered but most of us has been here long enough to know that Jesus was born he Manuel God entered in that baby when he was born amen the fullness of the Godhead bodily laying in a cradle hey but then brother man will say will you become the fullness of the Godhead a river Jordan no he manifested it he started brother Brown said it was his coronation day now okay if if day was a king and I was born a baby what am I out of there Prince heir to the throne right don't give me the car keys to the kingdom yet but when I come to my 30 age of 30 years over 29 and a half becoming 30 teen daddy begins to train me all right he begins to train me so when Jesus went to the River Jordan he received an anointing the pre strength to preach three and a half years that all of Christendom is based on that three and half years all of Christian anybody except for the you know look is low and all that stuff okay they know Jesus was anybody judeo-christian people believe that Jesus come and preach three and a half years and that is the basic of all Christianity that he was born that he preached the gospel and he died resurrected assembly can come back on the definite color pretty much everybody believed that now there's different forms of that but that is the form that he took to hide himself from some and reveal himself to us so on a day of river jordan brother brampton called it his coronation day what happens if God comes out and says hey this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell now you can say here you him here because you just start in this ministry just beginning okay because the vital said even Jesus grew in grace and knowledge and be made perfect because a bunch of pictures to go being made purview solenoid yeah he was born perfect but this he was still man you still in right being made perfect flesh the flesh because what happened was is he still was tempted in all these things and and all of his he must have somewhere in there had a will he said not my will but thy will right they said not my will but thy will be done right so somewhere in there he had to bring all that other suggestion but when Jesus was on our River Jordan the Holy Ghost ascended down like a dove Jon stead and the dub remain then that was the Ministry of Jesus Christ what God in human flesh preaching the gospel to what the children of the kingdom he goes he does Matthew 13 he goes and starts with what we store the seed whose ass or not a man where was the seed in him where's the seed in the mouth I mean when you a male to female gets together word see seeds in the mail alright so what he done he sowed the seed of eternal life that start the green years of preaching no one was perfect and he does preach Daniel 70 week i'll show it to you he'll tell you how the Madison second temple of God he'll show you all the all the things when this one comes and that welcomes he's pointing right straight to after we get out of here remember Matthew 24 is the seal then he begins to talk about what the olive tree who's that in Israel so dad because you know why she won't know that he told Daniel what's right if we believe God is one the Christ that was in Daniel in the Old Testament told Daniel was right and it couldn't be no different than when Jesus stepped on earth speaking back he had to fulfil all the scriptures all right that's where we get kind of confused and we say well maybe that no Christ old Daniel what to say and write then when Christ came on earth he could sell different so now if we believe the three and a half year Ministry of William Brown the ending of his message the dependable was the message of the Son of Man could it be imperfect sure he say 509 five thousand you know what I believe God then control all that just to throw people off just to throw people off that's all it does and you know what he he told us he said thank you Father he even thank God for confusing the wise and prudent and revealed an underpaid such as will learn so i said saying you know one devil he said while i was to talking you saying yesterday today whatever whatever he said back then is going on now or it's not the Eternal Word of God so if it's any different so then now let's go one more step if brother round come and preaches anything different than what jesus freak he's a false prophet hey man he said what about the white horse rider listen there was a mighty Conqueror there was a white horse road in that first Earth days he told us that what he was but there is a false white horse rider in opposition who goes first the devil or God God goes first he had white righteous church he was the mighty Conqueror but there was a revelation hid under that than when the seals open he showed that day that the revelation 6 white horse rider was antic rough yet Hannah the Bible's ribs absolutely I mean how much did you read it before you came even even i'm going to say receiving you burn not just in the message but when you receiving ueber things open up you've it that you had sent down a read and read and read and read and read and read and then you're ready one day I'd go who put that in there who put that in my because you could plainly see what was going on right okay that's what that's what the message come to do the message come to prepare us for a revelation then the message don't give you the revelation God gives you the revelation of what the message said remember in Revelation 10 John topping the bride takes the book from the what the mighty angel not from brother branham are not from the seventh angel he goes and gets the book from the what from Christ alright so not doing the later brother Brian because in the days of the boys he's when it showed us remember he's the leds are right Rebecca and Isaac and Ellie's are three's a crowd but Healy's are on that camel walk he didn't just he told her every characteristic of Isaac told them i mean just so much as when Rebecca jumps off the camel she looks out a feeling there's probably 200 people in field working she goes they're here yeah Ellie's Arvind you know what eliazar that didn't go know when y'all get married would be in this room over here no you never hear he leaves our home all he took Rebecca to Isaac and then Isaac and Rebecca I got married you don't hear any more abilities our Ellie's or took us to Christ but what she got off that cam alone was what Ellie's right over a man and then what she got off and run for Isaac knowing who that was was what Kelly's are told her before she got to Christ our eyes so it's the message of the hour that's what brings us to Christ because brother Brown you know that I love the little picture in brother Claude study I brother Jesse did it years ago but remember when brother branham indicted this generation he's pointing like this and then what he had was in the split picture and he had brother around standing here pointing and then he had the cloud of the Christ of the Hoffman heavy Christ end in the cloud and said a true prophet points you to cry and I like that yeah he was taking off the same while because we would Rebecca with him what you know if Eleazar would stayed there now the easier would it become common to Rebecca but it wasn't let's just put it in 2015 terms it wasn't el es or show right it's the bride in the bridegroom whatever you do now in your life people influence your life but the day you come to your wedding there's only two people stand in the front that's the bride and the bride green that's all nobody else you've got all the other people that are attendance our help but they don't all getting the same car with you and they're not all stuffed in a motel room or wherever you go on your home them they're not stuffed in there with you well if you got to be if you gotta be well if you got 20 mins and attendance and all that stuff and people helping you what I'm saying is the support group is to get you ready to get everything through it take some of the pressure off you and it's your day it's your name and truly if you want to get technical with it it's not even the bridegroom's day the like i said before you walk out i walked out you know and everybody's what they're anticipating when that song starts they rise and they don't look at me they turn and look at who the bride they don't care whether you're there and I they'd never heard anybody say that sure was a beautiful bright green if they do this two different things going on there but they said oh what a beautiful dress that bridegroom gar what a beautiful outfit one dude will hair they never say a mother bird I mean to bribery okay but you know what though the bridegroom knows who he is that's my whole point the bridegroom knows who he is he knows he's the head of the house he knows he's the one that she's coming to and the one that he's going to get to take behind the curtain are behind the end of ten not all these other people so he's ok he's confidence one say about you talk about what are you are you belittling the Lord know the Lord's wanted a stack bride to marry he knows who he is she's laying here yeah she's not when she wants up an out she's not looking everybody he's looking to write him when she you know all of you they got mad what were you leave for shutting the door open when we leaving for well hey John Susie no you know what most of you don't know who was at your wedding there was two hundred people in my way and I can't tell you except for the attendants and the people with took pictures who was there I mean afterwards you go they were there oh yeah they were right there on the front row you know or they were right there I me I don't know so see what I'm talking about when we come and then when we come to this ministry of the Son of Man it's a perfect ministry it's taking us straight to Christ no no false doctrine can take that into a body chain so we got to get this Daniel 70 weeks right just like the way the Prophet preach that he couldn't preach it no more than what the Bible says are no less you ever overseas I was thinking that has something to do with well see then you've got the other side watch this though you got the other side that says um is it over here I think but I know it's in foreign country so maybe mention it to me the other day that now they're saying it's all ensure all the attentions on the bride but like I said before the bridegroom's who wanted to ask the bridegroom is one us in buying the bride answer you can't do away with him but you know what I don't want people to notice me how old people to notice my bride because I know who I am right so God knows who he is just not belittling God because what they're saying on this side is that it saw the bride that Brides has been elevated above the head wrong you can't put that in the Bible you can't put that the prophets message Christ is the head always the man but now remember brother Graham says she is him well what he's saying is is she is him she's not exactly him she's different he's eternal God with an eternal body we're still down here is the bride trying to get perfected to take a body chain so no but she is now in characteristic we can't act any different than the head now they're okay when she is him it's not that she is him she's him made manifest in another part because remember truly Adam and Eve were one she was the same DNA she had the same body he did but she didn't have the same forward he did hey man she'd have same for him she had a character different than him because one brother Ram say he took the feminist part about putting need so Adam had two families part I mean Eve had finished part I don't hate the male part right so the true / one bone of their bone flesh the flesh but in characteristic look so we can never want to say that we can ever be putting ourselves in the place of the bridegroom ever cuz you know watch your you're superseding your head ship and as you and your wife follow God is how god it's like brother Brown said how you treat your wife South God creats you pretty much basically that's what it is okay so we're not getting anywhere today they just all right i mean we're trying to build something here because the Son of Man mastery is a perfect ministry it has no flaws come down brother branham was not based on a man he was a son of man but the son the son of man spoke so much through him till they thought he was God I grabbed her and think I was God to think I was the devil memory said that one time he said I'd rather think I was that close to be God them for somebody he said but I've been called an antichrist hood so you see with the same way with these doctrines of the bride groom being the most important and the bride groom I mean the bride being the most important let's bring them together let's bring them together input we know who he is he's the controller of everything supposed to be the controller of everything that we do but I'm glad brother Dale said what he did a couple of sundays ago because I've always want to say I'm ow scraping afraid you get mad all I can get lift people get mad at him I've always said that there's hears us down here here's what we supposed to be this is the perfect will of god this is the permissive will of God we live I'm talk about not right here most of the time we live on this side that gray area because i was telling who was that problem to yesterday don't I have something to yesterday everything for yesterday anyway we were talking about that o Shah umbrella markets the morning listen you sleep eight hours a day at least Im you sleep eight hours a day some longer some shorter that's an average of eight or today all right 20 hours a day you're sweet you only got 16 hours left right how much of it you you work eight hours then you got only it sorry you only got eight hours left right you got eight hours left because you're in work be honest you're not thinking about going all the time sometimes he may come down to bring something but I'm what I'm saying is what really i was talking about him is over here and the will of God was this person right here the Son of Man was in the will of God I do nothing except the father show me no we're not through that part yet hey man now no but we live in here and then God lets the slide over every once in a while a village prevalence and then we slide back over please get out of sleep you got eight hours of working right a 16-hour you only got eight hours left how long you have to pay your bills you go to walmart for an hour you pay your bills for an hour you drive somewhere to visit friends and family you calling your cell phone you look on facebook or any other thing i like them but you spend with your time focused on something so you really only got about an hour that you can really sit down i was telling mark i said i was praying hard the other night about something how about sleep run Millar woke up the next morning like I didn't finish how I am done I guess God was finished listening to me so here's late anyone hear me no more but there was something I was really praying it was Batman back soon I was praying to all of a sudden it was seven o'clock in the morning I thought well maybe my mind kept on going you know because the Bible says keep your mind on him keep the mind going keep in mind my pride so we really only live over here a very small portion of our life most of the comments right here but you got to do like brother brown said you you gotta bring everything into the middle anyway because you can't you can't worry about this flash but yet we do we do we worry about this flesh we get a little ache or pain and we get a sore we get this and we go by this and put this on this and that's okay that's fine we live in this but we have to we have to take care of this thing all right we do I mean you know what go say hello and just don't eat and go to feed you no don't say home God sends you so I knocked on the door to get a job no you gotta go out don't don't sit down and say well now God if you want me to go to church you're going to transport me or you go have to bring church here no and then you know what you arrived I and rub down your sleeve so there is parts of this human part that we have to have emotion relation all the thing is over here so if we bring them in the middle and say God please have more control my life than you did yesterday or have more control my life than you did a year ago and listen it's a stepping stone of a process don't get don't get so caught it with the details because you know what you're going to be like this I don't care if you're Christian you're still going to have updates and down day all right but the son of man had bad days too sure I'm sure he did because remember brother branham look at what happened to his body during that ministry of his how old he look Jesus was 30 and look 50 so he had a toll on his body don't tell me Jesus got a pebble dancing but thought I'm God ain't got no problems and everything no the devil was on that body all day long makes and pains and heartaches but you know what he done he said of course he knew he had a course to go he understood I only did what the father tells me to do and when so that's what we got to come to I don't I got my lips if I needed it but that tomato Son of Man ministry is a perfect ministry so we must bring everything to that perfect ministry our thoughts and ideas don't work the thoughts of God is what's perfect all right let's go finish this up next Sunday and we'll talk about the Sundays there is an oath I will let me tell you one more thing go go if you if you reading anything about three sons names now later on in brother grounds ministry he brings in for which to me for remember is the restoration he brings in son of Abraham heir to the grand that's what daddies talking about now the land the actual land that Palestine and all is he goes heir to the grant we're going to read that today but lean good time to worry the next Sunday but there is four sons name son of Abraham is entered into that I'm going away sure
