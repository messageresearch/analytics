you open our eyes Lord open our spiritual understanding open our spiritual eyes oh God that we may see the path that you're leading us through and Lord may we glorify your name at the end of this service and bring back to you all the honor and the Praises in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you pray amen amen before we sit down I'd like to invite you to read our opening texts for this afternoon in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 we're reading two verses Hebrews chapter 11 verses 5 and 6. this is a common verse that uh we normally read when we speak about the rapture we know that Enoch was the type of the Bride amen and so we read in verse 5 amen okay so Hebrews chapter 11 verse 5. by faith you know was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him but before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God but must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may God bless his word may not be seated um I've been uh praying for what uh I would like to share this afternoon and uh knowing that this congregation is more of a family church family oriented church and uh I was led inspired to to share something about Rapture in the family I want to speak about the Rapture in the family and we all know where whatever part of the world we we come from there's only one goal in our service to Christ that is to be in the Rapture right if you fail to be interruptured then all our efforts are Vain and so uh there's a question one time in uh in brother Brandon's time and he preached the the message thy house which is sometime 1961 the question goes like this when the Rapture takes place will all the Believers families wife and children go they're in the faith and trust in Jesus Christ as Lord so it is say the brother Brandon said this that's a legitimate question you want to know if all your family will be in the rapture and if you love your family you want to have your wife there your children there but this is what brother random answered he said uh we see that and then everyone that was found written in the book was delivered in that day of that before the tribulation so if your children your mother your loved ones whoever they are if their name is written on the lamps Book of Life my precious children you will be right there so it's more of a predestination it's more of election if our names are written in the Bible in the Lamb's Book of Life then we don't have to worry if we will be in the Rapture or our family will be in the Rapture that's why when the disciples came to Jesus and said they were rejoicing because they were able to cast out Devils heal the sick but then the Lord said to them don't Rejoice because you're able to just Rejoice because your your names right are written in the last book of life and that is what we are rejoicing for because we believe by faith that our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life otherwise we cannot we are not able to manifest the life that we are living right now and so going to our opening text it says there that the Enoch had a testimony and the testimony please God now what is in a testimony see it's this is the life that we live it is the character that we possess it is it is our the depth of our relationship to God amen so that's our testimony it's what you believe in now you know because of his testimony that please God he did not taste that but was raptured now raptures are going on time and I believe that Rapture is a victory because we are Overcomers so uh I I don't believe that uh when Rapture comes you're all you know tired and weary and wore out no it's like it's like an athlete in a race when you when you go to a race and you you can see the Finish Line you suddenly get this what you call the second wind you feel stronger you feel faster than when you started because you're seeing the end of the line and so so as we see this the end of the line we are our our spiritual strengths doubled and uh we are not going through the Rapture that that were falling or we are weak but as the Bibles we are Overcomers and Overcomers Are Victorious and if you are in Victory then I believe that uh we'll be we'll have spiritualists the spiritual distress that we need and the we see that before the Rapture the prophet mentioned about having a bride without spot or wrinkle a sin Free Church see and I believe that when that time comes the True Believers will not have a desire for sin it's not doesn't but people are Desiring see but I believe that that desire will be taken away from us there will be a people in this end times desire for sin will absolutely be taken away and the Bible said that we are in the world but we are not of this world so we are pilgrims just passing by time will come that sin will not have power on us before the Rapture takes place we will have a body change and the brother and brother Branham always calls this body as a past house that we live in and and we believe that one day this will be changed to a glorified form now if we truly understand amen the body change then we can present this body as a Living Sacrifice because we know that this will be change I can give I can give up everything you can give up a career you can give up you know anything about this world because you know that this will receive a body change see this will keep us going and we know that this body in this condition will not go to the Rapture it has to be glorified because flesh and flesh and blood will not go to heaven we have another body waiting for that and that's it you know it meets this physical body it becomes glorified form so in the Rapture that body will pick up the 16 elements if you are not I mean if already we have gone in Christ and the prophet it picks up the 16 elements of your Earthly body then it's changed into a glorified form so we in ourselves you know we we we there's there's a change to happen because in this body right now we say the the the word says and the message says that in this body dwell no good thing in one of his message it says this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has five inlets to that body he said that is the evil one on the outside right see and now in another message another message he says in the inside of that is the spirit see and you know Spirits are controlled by circumstances right see if if you're if you're hungry you know you don't feel so good but if you're a fool and you know you you're happy I mean your happiness is determined by what you feel right right so we are controlled by circumstances if we have money sometimes we're happy if you don't have money we're not happy see that that's how the official circumstances surrounding us affects our spirit but in the inside of the inside which are which is what the prophet calls the inside man he said uh there's only one since the sense that controls that and that is the free moral agency the free will to choose or to reject that is why whatever we do we cannot perfect this body when we come to church we do not feed this body but we feed the inside amen the inside you are the Inside Man and to be a believer you need to come to God you cannot go to heaven unless you came from heaven see it's it's your destination you are not going back to God unless you came from God Amen if you are not if we were in his mind our origin is not some certain place or certain countries amen our origin is in the in the mind of God and so we can see each other we don't we have cultural differences different backgrounds see but because of the message we were connected and then we see one another as different Brothers but we are in the same in the same line of thinking because of the message and this is what called us to be together and you know our origin is not as I said it's not some other places but we came from one place which is back in the mind of God Amen in that back part of God's mind we saw he saw us in our perfect condition amen God looks at us at the from the beginning until to the end he's not actually so much concerned in the in between he saw it from the beginning we may have weakness we may have shortcomings but you know God knows our end so it's like you know God took us in his mind put us in a book sealed it to the Seven Seals and at the end times he opened the sales and then you saw your name and that's why we are following this message amen then we recognize Who We Are we recognize that we are not of this world but we are from God's Eternal thoughts amen and so no matter what we lost we we lost on Earth maybe material blessings or material belongings it really doesn't matter at the end of the day what is what matters will will be that we are part of God's Eternal thoughts now this will give us the capacity to live a life that's worthy of the Gospel amen we are we are the revelation of the seals salvation is something that you choose as an individual amen but it because we are a free moral agent each individual has to come to that choice and we have the power of choice but our choice is in his choosing right we did not choose him actually it is he he was the one who chose us and we can read that in John chapter 15 he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so God gives us a choice but in one sense we have no choice because God chooses you and when he choose you he will never lose you no the Bible says no man can pluck you away from his hand amen amen see he will God will persevere until we are perfected and so as we go along in this life's journey sometimes we we get tired sometimes we stop sometimes we backslide no but but God will persevere to look after you to run after you he will never lose you this message will run after you right until until you you reach that statue of a perfect man and as I say uh if we insist to do wrong God would either take you home before your appointed time or you'll bring circumstances in your life to bring you back into the into into the right path and so our choice is in God's choosing the choice to obey or not was back in the beginning God gave man a commandment and that's not to partake of the tree of knowledge see and he has the choice now we know that the woman was deceived but Adam was not deceived his decision however was to partake of the three of uh the knowledge of Good and Evil because through this act the woman will not be killed by God right so he partook it by this decision and by this decision of our first parents man was driven out of Eden amen it was their choice but we suffered the consequence right the choice of the parents but the children us suffer the consequence see so it what we as parents I'm a parent uh I'm a father of four children and the we as parents I would say that we are responsible for every single decision that we will make right for it will affect our children okay a right decision will bring about a blessing in the family but a wrong decision can bring a curse to the family amen by your decision you can either build or destroy the future of your family and this decision includes you know it includes the school that they will go to the church that will they will choose to be their home Church the place where you will live and all this you know daily decision making it will affect our children and our decision will actually reveal who we are what is our priority and what is important to us amen you see the decision of the parents it always affects the children and I would like to read a portion here in Matthew chapter 27 uh before the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified in March 27 uh we'd like to hear uh we'd like to read here in verse 21 where where Jesus Christ was interrogated by Pontius Pilate you know there were two they have the choice during the feast day they have a choice to release one of the prisoners and they they presented Jesus Christ and Barabas and Barabas was as we know he's a murderer and it's a notable prisoner he was called Barabas see and uh in verse 17 he says there therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them who believe that I listen to you or Jesus Christ is which is called Christ for he knew that for Envy they had delivered him when he was set down on the Judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing have doubt nothing to do with the just that just man so they know that Jesus Christ was a just man amen for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and Elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabas and Destroy Jesus and so the governor answered and said unto them where of the twain will you that I release unto you they said Barabas pilot said unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called the Christ right and they all say unto him let him be crucified this was the decision of the people right it was not pilate who decided to lose the people who decided this and when pilate so that he could Prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude is saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on Beyond us and right on our children I mean so maybe some of the children were not yet born during that time but they were deciding for their children see and their decision to pick Barabbas instead of Jesus Christ to be to be let free it affected you know generations of generation of Jews see we we see what happened to them in 70 A.D and we see what we saw what happened to them uh during the the Holocaust and it was because of the decision of this parents amen and and maybe these parents are long gone but because of their decision they said be it on us and be it on our children right right so what goes out of our mouth as parents it's very much important because it will affect the future of our children if the Lord that is whatever we say a profound effect on our children right amen see so your decision will uh reveal the audition reveals what is in our mind and you know the minds actually the processing unit of what is in our heart amen the the pro the the the the the the word says that we're thinking out from our hearts and the the thoughts are processing our mind and it comes out from our mouth amen so what comes out of our mouth is the one that defiles us but where did it come from from our hearts we were thinking in our hearts we are pondering on this thing so if you are pondering the negative things all the negative things will come out of your mouth you can sit in a prayer with a negative person talk to him for 30 minutes if he's a negative person he always talks about negative things 30 minutes later you're a negative person because the spirit that is in that person transfers to you because Spirit transfers through words can you transfer towards you catch the spirit amen and so we should be very careful uh listening to you know to to the words that we hear so moving further uh when it uh we want to look at Isaac and Rebecca this is the type of Jesus Christ in the bride and Elisa as we know is the messenger now when we when Elisa was sent to look for a bride he was told to go and get a woman from the family of Abraham right not from the Canaanites but from his family that was the instruction that uh uh Elisa got from his master Abraham but there were no other specification but because he was the messenger he has the mind of his master he has the mind of his master so he was he was he was thinking and he was praying about uh he was looking for a character of a bride see and when he when he went there he was he was just talking to himself he was talking to God if if this damself will come out go here and you know ask me for a drink of water she will also give water to the camels and that is what exactly Rebecca did right he he didn't hear anything from Elisa but Rebecca being the predestinated bride for Isaac he was able to capture the mind of the messenger right and he was manifesting it because it was already in his in her character to be a servant so you see in our times the message had the messenger brother Branham had the mind of God on what he wants for a bride okay so we have the Siegen of God in our heart and we will be able to pick up his mind amen as well as as well as Rebecca was able to pick up what was in the mind of Elisa and if you don't have the decision of God we can hear you know we can we can listen to the message of the Prophet over and over again it will make no difference in your life see but if you have a sitting of God something some something inside will Quicken amen and you know our work is an individual walk father we can I cannot say to my children because I am a believer you will be a believer they have to have their own experience they have to grow up in in maturity they have to serve the Lord day of day of to to have a deeper relationship I mean all my children are baptized but as I told I tell them as you grow up you have to have your own experiences with the Lord right I tell my wife you have to have your own experiences with the Lord and even me as a minister I have to have my own experience to the Lord I cannot just preach out of knowledge I have to preach out out of my relationship from with the Lord see so the Holy Spirit uh is that is there watching the family amen and if there's one is between the husband and the wife amen uh we can see that there's complete submission I mean if the husband will submit to the to God the wife will submit to the husband and the children will submit to the parents there will be Oneness at home and the Holy Spirit is pleased to dwell in a home that is filled with with unity and love and respect with each other so the holy spirit is pleased to dwell in that kind of atmosphere you know Adam and Eve they had a son his name is Abel and uh and how did he know that the the blood caused the fall no I I would I would imagine that every time Adam walk around Abel can see Adam wearing this lamp skin and he might be wondering it's your mind where did this came from maybe he can even see that the blood dripping and the and by the example amen that is so in his parents he was able to make the right sacrifice now Cain on the other hand was also seeing this kind of thing but he didn't have the revelation exactly see there was nothing in him to understand what he's seeing so these are two individuals seeing the same example amen but Kane never saw the Revelation so he never did the right uh the right thing so Abel made the sacrifice that was pleasing to God Kane made a sacrifice he also made the sacrifice but it was not pleasing to God right okay I mean going to the Rapture is about pleasing God it's not pleasing our parents pleasing our children or even pleasing somebody else it's about pleasing God walking in a way that is pleasing to God Amen so God revealed it through a way that the parents are living their life and this Revelation humbled Abel and it is a sacrifice that was pleasing to God Amen now Cain because lack of lack of Revelation he he made the sacrifice but it was not pleasing to God you see every time we we when we receive when we receive a revelation amen and we and because of that revelation we do a thing that is pleasing to God then that is what counts amen in in the Book of Luke I would like to to read another scripture in the Book of Luke chapter in chapter 23. in verse 32 it says here and there were also two other male factors male factors means the evil doers yeah criminals with him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the male factors one on the right hand and the other on the left they said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted this treatment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them the right of him saying he saved others let him save himself if we be Christ The Chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and the superscription was also written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of Jews now watch this closely now in verse 39 it says one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him right right in other words he was also mocking Christ he said if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other on the right hand he said answering rebuking him saying does now that fear God seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation if we indeed justly for we receive the Jew reward of our Deeds but this man not done nothing amiss and he said unto the Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom you know that statement of one of this criminal discriminate these male factors has pleased God right amen he pleased God that in verse 42 he said verily I say unto you today Thou shalt be with me in paradise and now if you try to analyze this situation this male Factor on the right hand I mean all through his life he was a thief he never attended any Bible study he never attended any church he he never had any Revelation but I I could imagine that was when he was hung there they were seeing Jesus Christ you know being being nailed to the cross and putting this sign this is the king of the Jews this is the king of the Jews and maybe he had the Revelation if this is the king then he might have a kingdom right and if he has a kingdom amen his request was remember me when thou comments into thy kingdom and so that piece of Revelation giving an access to Paradise he spoke the words that pleased God right while on the other hand that male Factor saw it also never saw the revelation and what he said is instead of asking mercy and Grace from the Lord he start mocking amen see so this there's a big difference in in our perception amen I I was talking uh I was speaking one time uh in uh in the Philippines there's there was a a shoe salesman yeah just just to emphasize the the difference of perception there was a Salesman that was sent you know to the to the to the islands and the uh they're wanting to expand their business of you know selling shoes and when they when when that first salesman went to the island they said uh there were we we don't have any Market in this island because people were not wearing shoes they're barefooted so if you put a store here nobody will buy shoes that was his perception and so he went back to the company and told their boss we don't have any Market that forget it but they sent another uh salesman who went there the same island and so these people with the barefooted no shoes and he said he went back to the company I reported we have a lot of Market there because all people there are not wearing any shoes see the same island the same people but two different perceptions and so the and they so they started building this this this store and now I mean they got richer because all the people want to have their own shoes but it started with difference of perception right right we can look at the same thing with the different you know interpretation and meaning to it but we we realize amen like these two male factors here they both were seeing but only one got the Revelation and what came out of his mouth please God that he granted this request and he was able to have access to Paradise amen so the Rapture will come and God will look for things that comes out of our mouth if it will be pleasing amen if if we speak of things that are not pleasing to the Lord then we cannot say that we're living a life that is pleasing to God amen now we are we we every one of us here know the the story of how to write how how uh two sons were receive salvation and uh I just like to give uh to give some emphasis on this uh part of the the message where it says in question and answer how to write the other day she did this didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing which please right the holy spirit amen and what was the thing he said uh in another message says I know more than said that until sister Hattie sitting there crying right now hadn't said the word and she said that's nothing but the truth this simple phrase see he said the right thing said at which pleased the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit was pleased by the words that came out of her mouth amen he had access to the third pool the Holy Spirit tell her you know that he could she could ask anything that her heart desires and it shall be produced right there that you know that the Lord of God the son said his prayers and of course we know the rest of the story instead of asking for the healing of her sister of asking for uh thousands of dollars he asked in this word said my greatest desires for the Salvation of my two boys amen the right desire the right words coming out of her mouth gave her access to the third pool so in brother Banner spoke it he said ask and then it happened so that is how uh when we say that we live a life that's pleasing to God amen it manifests in the words that we say it manifests when manifest interaction because we can we can always say that we are we have a life that's pleasing to God but as long as we say the right thing as long as we we do not we do the right thing then everything is just you know like a mental exercise so we we realize my brothers and sisters that uh as we go along in this life's journey there are so many things that we can do that we we might offend the Lord right right and there are so many things that we can do that we may please the Lord and most of the time it it is those words that come out of our mouth that pleases God like for example the woman whose child was vexed as we may read in Matthew 15 he says then came she and worship him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it's not meat to take the children's bread and to cause it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered the senator oh woman great is thy faith because of what she said amen three the Lord said woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made old from that very hour how did this come about because of the words that came out the words that came out of of this woman amen and we can also talk about the Centurion that uh we read in Macho in the book of March also verse where it says the Centurion yeah uh there came a centurion beseeching him and said you know he has a servant that is sick of policy grievously tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him see but this is the Centurion answered now watch what he says I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only in my servant shall build for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me you know in other words you know what he's doing he knows the the the level of authority and he said uh I say to this man go and go away to another come and he comment and to my servant do this and do with it when Jesus heard it in Marvel they said unto him to them that what verily I say to you I have not found so great of Faith No not in Israel and you know Center is a gentile and so again the words that came out of the mouth of this Centurion it pleased God right in fact the Lord describes himself was he marveled and he saw uh what what what he was asking for came to pass at that very hour and every time we we speak of positive things we please the Lord amen even brother random in his life uh in his lifetime we realize how how saying the right things amen we're talking about Rapture in the family see and then one there was a story you know we know that uh uh Meda had this two more size of a lemon I decide and whether banana was supposed to go to a meeting but you know Med already wanted to go to the doctor to to have it removed and so uh he met them because maybe he was she was irritated because of what he's feeling had said something that might have offended the Holy Spirit and uh you know brother brother Brandon he could he could have he could have stood there and said that he's a prophet and he said he said he could say that uh I should I should do first my Ministry before my wife or my family or anything I mean I mean the the the the the priorities and so but brother Branham had the right mind he had the right saying he said I said Lord she didn't mean what she said that morning she didn't mean that I said Lord not one time has she ever said one word about me going in the meetings staying months or whatever it was not one time has she ever opened her mouth about it she has always sent my clothes to the cleaners amen wash my shirts and had everything ready to go in the meeting then she wonders how she can serve God see I mean when he was she when he was trying to intercede for her wife he was not saying you know have mercy on my wife he knows the Seven Seals he knows the church ages he knows the doctrines of the message no he said he always send my clothes to the cleaners see he washed my shirts and have everything ready to go in a meeting you see and he said you women as you serve your husband you serve God right see you know then when I came in all Titan world she said people coming from everywhere and I have to go somewhere on a fishing trip or a hunting trip many women would have blow up at that but what would she do she would get my hunting clothes ready for me to go let me go Lord she didn't mean that what she have said see she had to be cut open three times in account of she was cesarean and I hate to see her have it do it again and just then I heard something in the room I look up in the voice said stand up now whatever you say that's the way it will be amen I waited for just a minute just before before the doctor said the hand of God shall take the tumor away and it wouldn't be found and no we we know the rest of the story there was no operation that was done for sister Meda because when brother Brown said that right words for his wife amen God the Holy Spirit spoke to him that whatever he will say it will come to pass right and so even in our families we are all believers waiting for the Rapture it is very important what I'm trying to stress it is very important that we say the right words to our husband to our wife to our children because by the words that will come out of our mouths amen it could it could determine their future it could affect their health it could affect their spiritual life amen and so I I was I was talking to some of the ministers in the Philippines and I said what's important it's a group of ministers not a formal Minister's meeting but we were discussing about Ministry and you know when it comes to Ministry many will stand up and they say they have done this they have done this and they've done that and I don't know here in the U.S but in the Philippines maybe it's also through here in the Philippines that there are people that are or many brothers are trying to be ministers when they are not called to be ministers amen they're not called to be ministers and uh you know the prophet has said that you know that uh uh the ministry of Demand versus his family okay right if you keep on you know going around preaching away evangelizing the whole world and you leave your family with nothing to eat that's not right see everybody's blessed except your wife everybody's blessed except your children and so you can you can say that you have baptized many souls and everything and so forth and so on and you can make you know uh reports and everything but when I speak to a brother a minister I I always look at the wife I look at the children if they are spiritual then I know this brother is spiritual but if they can say that they so they have so many accomplishments and you see the wife because the wife is the reflection of the husband amen the children are the reflection of the parents if they if if they are not blessed then what you're doing as a brother as a minister is not does not count in God's scoreboard it's zero right right see so uh as I was telling them then we should put our priorities in the right place amen we should put first in the food on the table then we can be a blessing to others amen I have talked to some young people and they said I was talking to a son of a minister in the Philippines and I said when you grow up they want to be a minister said no I don't want to be a minister because when he was growing up their life was affected because his his father went on full-time Ministry and they the often they will leave the family without nothing to eat right you know go back after many weeks and you know they need something I mean these children will not understand anything about right missionary works of every or everything unless they see that in the parents so it is very important that we see that we see how we look you know how brother Branham said about they're not juvenile delinquents it's about juvenile parenting see and you can you can have a covering of doing so many things for the world but unless it is seen in the family amen that's that will have an impact I mean in in the in the children and so when we see all these things that are happening see everything that is happening around we look at the the science in the sky the everything the political scenario we look at Israel then we have to look at ourselves you may look up for your Redemption draw it now you will look you may look around and see the modern events uh made clear by prophecy but if we fail to look inside I mean it's not the things that we uh we are doing but it's the small things that we fail to do see so we have to go back to the basic and you know the basic unit of a society is the family to have a strong Church you have to have strong families amen and the strong family would consist of father mother and children of course but the spirituality of the family will determine the spirituality of the church and so we I we want to give emphasis also not not to neglect of course if our children are grown up they have their own families then they're responsible for their own families amen but uh as long as we are we are they are still in our in our uh care then I believe that we are responsible for them and everything that they will hear from us everything that we that they will see in us doing it will affect their decision making in the future it will defeat it will affect their life in the future and you see no matter how long you are you may be you know you may be in the message uh if your mind is not guarded I mean our soul maybe we may be born again we will be serving the lord but our mind is still vulnerable to the works of the devil that's why the prophet said this is the greatest battle ever fought is done in the mind not in the heart not in the flesh but in the mind and you see I would like to to to just to share this uh little story that uh the prophet mentioned in uh his message way back in 1957 the title of the message is life just to emphasize this uh the point that I'm trying to raise he said uh there was one day he saw yeah this uh there was a young lady who went to a psychiatrist she's 35 years old never smoked never drunk in his life she was a very fine girl a Christian girl see her people are Christians you see so he said her father's a doctor she gave her life to Christ at an early stage so there's no question about his spiritual life I mean for 35 years been said she has been serving the lord and the uh his family serving her family serving the lord but one day she goes out and she finally gets to a place to a college where she was teaching and the psychiatrist was there amen he sat down to talk to her and said you mean that you have never been kissed by a boy just one question you mean to say at 35 years old Never Been Kissed by a boy you mean he said he said never and he said girl you don't know what you're missing he said him being a psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind until now she's become so evil 35 years being a Christian and now because of this demonic psychiatrist swinging is my her mind he said now she's become so evil and so bad till she don't even want to hear the name of Jesus the name of Jesus spoke to her in her presence and even her father and mother can even see her no more she lost her mind and this next week will go to the institution for shock treatment now he further analyzes the situation he said it's because that she turned her thoughts from Christ and to what thy psychiatrist was moving her mind to amen just a simple turn amen and that's what we hear Jesus said that is what what we're here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world unto the things of God which is eternal and that's what preaching is for is to pervert the thinking to a higher and to a better place where Christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those those things that which are above now the Bible says in Colossians set your affection on things that are above when I was talking to the brothers and sisters that were affected by the typhoon I mean as I was telling this morning money money is no value in that time everything that they have when we speak of the the promise not only the Believers there was I know of of a couple they were not Believers but they they were working all through their life saving money they they put up a business in those Pro in one of those provinces and when they put up this business they said oh no no they can retire and have better pay but just one storm one super typhoon it took everything that they have saved throughout the lifetime throughout their lifetime and see if you're if if their affection if their Treasures are in those uh buildings business or whatever now they're totally depressed yeah that's why the Bible says set your affection and things that are above no amount of super typhoon or earthquake or volcanic eruption our affection is on above we may we we we we may lost everything that we have here in this earth amen but that's a good thing because you are not anchored to these things not the Believers in in those provinces they were telling now we're ready for the rapture because we have no homes to go to we are not anchored in any material thing anymore see so sometimes disaster is good right right you know miss you know what happened to the wife of Lord they were right on their way out of Saddam but she has so many properties that she can stand the last look but I mean our brothers and sisters in the Philippines that were affected even though they look several times they will see nothing right they have nothing they're not anchored in any material things anymore and now they have houses they're thankful but they they believe that God can take that away again easily see so it teaches us I mean we who have not experienced that it it teaches us that we should anchor ourselves not on the material world not not on The Treasure of this world because it can easily be gone away I mean you have your own disasters here you have your 9-1-1 here you have their Katrina here and I mean many people lost their lives many people lost their properties but you know it is it should be a wake-up call to everybody but sometimes it doesn't work that way and so we see now that we should set our affection on things that are above after all the prophet said happiness does not consist on the material things that we have but but on how contented that we can be in the allotted portion for us see if you are contented in the allotted portion that God has given us you may have a bigger allotted portion than I am but if I am contented you're contented then we're equal right amen that would be no problem I don't care if you you earn one thousand dollars I earn one thousand pesos that's a big difference but but if I'm contented with this 1000 Pesos you're contented to your one thousand dollars then you're equal I'm as Rich As You Are amen hallelujah hallelujah there's no problem see but the problem is in the contentment see so if if we are all contented in what we have then I can look to other people and I can look to other people like I will not compare myself there's a point that goes I don't know if you read it do not compare yourself to others because for always there will be lesser and greater person than yourself if you compare yourself to others you may become vain if you're greater than them or you may become bitter if you're lower than them and so we we I don't want to compare myself to others I want to compare myself to the word if I'm lining up with the word then that's that's fine right right I may not have everything you may not have everything but as long as we are aligned with the word then it's all right we can walk a walk that's pleasing to God see and pleasing to God means uh our affection are not in this earth I believe that Eno when he was walking the first 65 years of his life you see if we go back to Genesis 5 he said here it says here Genesis 5 21 and Enoch live 65 60 and five years and we got Methuselah see and Enoch work with God after not before but after he begot methusilla and he lived another 300 years now if I if my mathematics is right the first 65 years he was not walking perfectly with God because he said he walked with God after he begot Methuselah and he he lived 365 years okay so 300 minus 65 300 minus Q is 300. so in all the days of Enoch were 300 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so I would say that when he started this walk with God maybe when he started walking with God he never the prophet said he never missed any word of God right right he did not misbehave everything God told him to do he done it no argument no murmuring and no matter what the people thought he went and done it just the same we see a lesson here we may not be able to start right in our walk with God and you became you became born again but but you know you just come and go and come and go so we may not be able to start that in our spiritual life but there is an appointed time in our life that we will start to walk closely with God until uh he will be so pleased and I don't know I I believe that will be global amen if you walk a place and walk with God we woke up listening walk with God one day God will come to take us away amen and you will not leave you know her family behind we don't want them to to leave them back you know the uh I I don't know if we have some military men here but uh when I was in the military in the Philippines we we have a one of the rules that we have when we engage in the communist rebels or the Muslim Rebels if if I'm like for example I'm a platoon leader and I'm Leading the People the the one of the orders do not leave any man behind you don't leave them whether they're wounded they're killed in action as if we went there as a platoon we'll go out there as a platoon see we don't want to leave any man behind amen and that's just a simple you know simple War simple battle but when you leave this earth we don't want to leave any of our children behind we don't want to leave any brother behind we don't want to leave any sister behind and so we have to encourage each one of us we have to strengthen one another pray for one another because we are here serving the lord and it will be better if we will see each other on the other side amen and so we believe that the Lord is doing everything for us showing us the things that we have never seen before I mean is slowly unveiling himself to us and you know when when God unveiled this AC cell to us see there we we know that we are in an invisible Union the bridegroom and the bride and you know there are no two persons no two persons male and female can can address before each other outside of the marriage covenant if they do that that is immoral right see of course people are doing that but that's immoral that's not accepted right right yeah but if you if you're under a marriage covenant then you can be undressed before your wife and the wife before the husband and there's no malice because they under the marriage Union and now we are in the marriage Union the invisible Union of the the bridegroom in the bride right right and so now God is not ashamed to unveil himself before us right and we are not ashamed of Christ amen we are the bride he's the bridegroom see and when when for example if I if I can read what's in the mind of brother Samuel he can be unveiled before me right see before he moves I know what he'll be doing because I can read his mind but God in this last days has poured everything he has unveiled his mind he says send it to us and if we capture it then he's unveiled before us then we can do what he what what what what he wants us to do for him and we can live a life that will be pleasing to God but again we need to be very diligent right amen we have to to to have a singleness of Mind singleness of focus as as Elijah was going up and Elijah was there and he said he wanted to have the double portion and Elijah said that's too much but if he can see me go up you will have the prophet said singleness of Mind singleness of focus then you will have what you want and so that's what he did Elijah had the singleness of mine had the singleness of focus he saw Elijah being being touched away and then and and what happened then the second hundred Rome just fell on him and he smoked the river he was not no longer looking for Elijah he was not looking for Elijah we are not looking for another Elijah he said where is the god of Elijah where is the god of Elijah and now Elijah has come in our days Elijah's left the sin but he left a message and that message if we will have singleness of focus singleness of Mind in the message that he left us then we can we can receive the anointing and we can say where is the god of Elijah where is the god of Elijah then he can work through us and we can work he can work through everybody and of course brother Brandon will always be the prophet messenger of the age there's nothing nobody coming after him there's no eighth messenger whatsoever but we believe that he has given to us what we will be needing to prepare us for the Rapture right right and so with this statements I I I pray that as we await in this glorious coming we will have to look after ourselves our family see because Rapture is in the family right right yeah we don't you don't want to be raptured by yourself we want our wives to be there the husbands to be there the children to be there the grandchildren to be there of course we cannot make the choice but by faith yes I would I I believe that I my whole family would be with me in the Rapture I believe that your family will be in the Rapture and as long as we we continuously serve the Lord and we continuously walk uh perfectly in the sight of God that will be pleasing to him then we know that when Rapture takes place we'll all be there right we'll all be there so God bless you all and I would like to invite you again to powerheads and just to say a word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father yes Lord we thank you Lord that you've given us a message a message of restoration we have lost many things in along the way we have experienced so many things Lord that sometimes we feel like not moving forward anymore but Lord you have given us the strength you've given us the courage to continue and sometimes maybe we may be wary in this life's journey but you continuously encourage us and give us strength Lord I pray Lord that when the time comes that you'll be with us it will be coming to take us away that no one in our family will be left behind help us as parents Lord to lead our children and give them the instruction and admonition in your word and Lord we pray for each other not only those who have families Lord but even the individuals Lord those who are living a single life Lord may you help us Lord to walk you know in a in a walk that will be pleasing to you perfectly in your side help us to walk perfectly in your side and in our in the things that
