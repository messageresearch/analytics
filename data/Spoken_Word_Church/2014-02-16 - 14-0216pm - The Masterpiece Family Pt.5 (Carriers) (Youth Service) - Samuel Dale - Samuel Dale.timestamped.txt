[28:17] living
[28:18] thank you for your
[28:21] love for us that you've bestowed upon us
[28:25] the ability to be able to hear
[28:29] it's the end time word that we could
[28:31] have an opportunity
[28:33] to be able to become what you want us to
[28:35] be
[28:37] we believe you and we thank you
[28:39] we know that you
[28:41] for ordained these days to be
[28:44] your foreknowledge lets you know what
[28:46] would take place in the hours that we're
[28:48] living
[28:49] but we're here that we have to live out
[28:51] those things
[28:52] and that's what we're desiring to be
[28:54] have your way with us now forgive our
[28:57] sins remember the sick ones lord
[28:59] remember sister
[29:01] donna
[29:02] wilson there lord it should be with her
[29:04] and when they she goes to the doctor
[29:06] that
[29:07] they'll say
[29:08] all is well
[29:10] cause we believe you we love you and we
[29:12] thank you have your way with each and
[29:14] every one of us lord forgive our sins
[29:17] because we want to be covered by your
[29:19] blood
[29:20] guide us now and keep us in jesus name
[29:22] amen
[29:24] okay john
[29:26] 12. now remember our thought is
[29:29] masterpiece family
[29:31] and we've been coming from isaiah
[29:34] and just not reading it but remember in
[29:36] isaiah 1 it says
[29:39] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[29:42] all right
[29:43] and the prophet when he gets into the
[29:45] sixth seal he's using that scripture he
[29:47] said
[29:48] the arm of the lord the word of the lord
[29:53] is revealed
[29:54] all right so
[29:56] if you believe i report i want to try to
[29:58] make a report today
[30:00] you know of what i believe
[30:03] and if it's the word of god
[30:04] then i expect him to honor that and to
[30:09] reveal it
[30:10] because i know and realize that i cannot
[30:13] the best i can do is
[30:15] uh stir up your mind of a way you know
[30:18] to help you and to understand but i know
[30:22] and realize that it takes the holy ghost
[30:24] to reveal
[30:26] all right
[30:27] so think on these things now
[30:29] and i would think a little bit today as
[30:32] we're
[30:33] trying to cover as i said i wanted to
[30:35] cover this
[30:37] in many different ways the prophet would
[30:39] speak from the masterpiece he's not able
[30:41] to shuck
[30:42] the many things that he covers
[30:45] and all to help us to see where we're at
[30:49] the day that we're living the hour that
[30:51] we're upon the earth
[30:52] and see i believe then the word of the
[30:54] lord is being revealed if we can see
[30:56] that to recognize our day
[31:00] in its message
[31:02] so look at the scripture we're talking
[31:03] about now in john 12 23
[31:08] and jesus answered them saying the hours
[31:11] come
[31:12] that the son of man should be glorified
[31:16] now what's right what he goes straight
[31:18] to now
[31:19] and this is going to tell you how the
[31:20] son of man is going to be glorified
[31:22] right
[31:23] because that's what he's saying
[31:26] the hours come that the son of man
[31:27] should be glorified verily verily i say
[31:29] unto you
[31:30] except the corner of wheat fall into the
[31:32] ground and
[31:33] died abideth alone but if it die it
[31:35] bringeth forth much fruit
[31:37] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[31:40] and he that hateth his life in this
[31:42] world shall keep it unto eternal life
[31:45] or life eternal
[31:47] if any man serve me let him follow me
[31:50] and where i am there
[31:52] shall also my servant be
[31:55] if any man
[31:57] serve me
[31:58] him with my father father
[32:01] honor all right let's just stop right
[32:03] there
[32:04] because that's where our thought is at
[32:06] now we'll go to hosea
[32:10] 6
[32:13] and we'll just read the first three
[32:14] verses
[32:16] come and let us return unto the lord for
[32:18] he hath torn and he will heal us
[32:21] he has smitten and he will bind us up
[32:24] after two days
[32:26] will he revive us
[32:28] in the third day he shall raise us up
[32:31] and we shall live in his sight
[32:33] then shall we know if we follow on to
[32:36] know the lord
[32:38] his going forth is prepared as the
[32:40] mourning and he shall come forth unto us
[32:44] as the rain
[32:45] the latter and the former rain
[32:48] unto the earth you may be seated the
[32:50] lord at his blessing to the reading of
[32:52] the word
[32:54] now
[32:58] we know that we were all and everybody
[33:00] was i was and everybody else was
[33:02] expecting us to be out of here by now
[33:04] and
[33:05] we talk about the 2000 years but
[33:07] remember hosea says there in the third
[33:10] day
[33:11] in the third day
[33:13] it would come forth a time all right
[33:16] now
[33:17] to not back up a lot but to
[33:20] review just a little
[33:22] as to what we're trying to bring on the
[33:25] masterpiece family
[33:29] and i believe that
[33:31] the old testament
[33:34] see the first masterpiece was adam and
[33:36] eve in the garden all right
[33:39] but then the next masterpiece family as
[33:42] you would call it was actually in jesus
[33:44] christ
[33:45] when he came forth to be
[33:48] as the old testament as we were covering
[33:50] this morning those prophets brought the
[33:54] word
[33:55] abraham isaac jacob joseph made a
[33:57] foundation
[33:58] and then the they were the patriarchs
[34:00] and then the prophets built the body and
[34:02] john the baptist being the last one to
[34:05] come to introduce the head
[34:08] and i hope you was following that this
[34:09] morning that he says those other
[34:11] prophets were only prophesying
[34:14] you know something to come but he wasn't
[34:17] prophesying of something to come
[34:21] right
[34:22] he wasn't saying there'll be a lamb come
[34:25] he was pointing right to him and saying
[34:28] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[34:31] the sin of the world it was no longer
[34:33] prophecy
[34:34] it was an actual
[34:37] happening
[34:38] all right and i was covered this morning
[34:40] then
[34:41] that we're talking about down through
[34:43] the ages and how that john the baptist
[34:47] come to introduce to the messiah
[34:51] and the prophet in this last days come
[34:53] to introduce the word
[34:56] to you and i
[34:57] all right and he would be saying
[35:00] see
[35:02] not pointing or prophesying
[35:05] a lot of his message was prophecy
[35:08] and there are some things that are still
[35:10] prophecy
[35:11] like the rapture to come etc etc that
[35:14] hasn't taken place yet
[35:16] but
[35:17] a lot of it has taken place there and he
[35:19] said i'm not saying he's coming i'm
[35:21] saying he's here
[35:23] he wasn't that was what caught me
[35:26] when i began to read the prophet's
[35:28] message back there in the 60s and begin
[35:31] to hear about it is i i heard a man
[35:34] talking about something that was there
[35:38] i couldn't understand it sure but
[35:41] you know he didn't talk about a god up
[35:43] in heaven or or something to come we
[35:46] were good baptist you know i hope i'm
[35:48] saved maybe i'm saved i believe i'm
[35:50] saved but i don't really know where i'm
[35:52] saved or not but one of these days i'll
[35:53] find out they get over there that i'm
[35:54] saved you know you say well we didn't
[35:57] talk like that well probably didn't but
[35:58] that's what we meant
[36:00] you know that's what was doing because
[36:02] we were living just upon hopes or
[36:04] prophecy
[36:06] you know
[36:07] when brother branham was not doing it he
[36:08] was speaking
[36:10] personal he spoke of a god that lived
[36:15] where we spoke of a god that was or
[36:17] would be and
[36:18] you know he spoke of something that was
[36:20] real right there
[36:22] in his life and that was what caught me
[36:25] all right
[36:26] but now
[36:27] what i want us to do this afternoon is
[36:29] try to pick up a point and watch these
[36:32] places i'm saying
[36:34] using different ways of expressing it
[36:38] but making it the same goal starting off
[36:40] here
[36:41] winding up here
[36:43] you know in a great doings
[36:46] you know taking and going up each one is
[36:48] going that away and if you'll follow it
[36:51] all right
[36:52] now we know
[36:54] that
[36:56] they're in the scripture that we read
[36:59] where it says unless the corn of wheat
[37:01] die
[37:02] and fall into the ground
[37:04] that it'll abide alone all right we know
[37:06] that we're talking about jesus christ
[37:09] because he was the corn of wheat
[37:12] now remember as i said the other few
[37:14] weeks ago
[37:16] we just read corn of wheat
[37:19] well we're thinking about wheat and corn
[37:21] or maybe something but
[37:22] when you're reading that go back to the
[37:24] original and you find out because we
[37:26] already known that thought
[37:27] but see when you say corn
[37:30] of wheat
[37:32] it really means grain of wheat
[37:35] one grain
[37:36] one grain that's what it's really saying
[37:38] one grain of wheat
[37:40] all right because that's who he was
[37:44] he was the one grain of wheat he was the
[37:46] original seed
[37:48] all right
[37:49] now in doing that then you can see that
[37:52] the scripture is not it's playing around
[37:54] it's saying it right
[37:55] so that grain of wheat
[37:58] had to die
[38:00] go into the ground
[38:02] right man
[38:05] and come back again
[38:07] all right
[38:08] now
[38:10] it died one man one grain
[38:12] so just like when you're planting corn
[38:14] or wheat or whatever you're planting
[38:17] you don't plant one grain to be able to
[38:19] reap one grain that wouldn't be too
[38:21] profitable
[38:22] you know it wouldn't help you much
[38:25] so you plant one grain though and it
[38:26] produces mini grain
[38:29] but you know what each one of those
[38:30] grains is just like the original
[38:33] you know unless perversion is happening
[38:34] something wrong with it it comes forth
[38:36] just like the original but you got it in
[38:38] multiple form
[38:40] all right
[38:42] now remember the point
[38:47] even though the grain of wheat comes
[38:49] forth in a multiple form which is over
[38:51] into the bride of christ
[38:54] and she comes forth
[38:56] but just remember it's still one grain
[38:58] all right
[39:00] you know it's still one grain
[39:02] because that's the way god looks at it
[39:04] he doesn't look at it as
[39:06] scattered out bunch of grain you know
[39:08] and doing things he's looking at it as
[39:10] the original
[39:13] grain all right
[39:14] in doing that then that grain of wheat
[39:18] would be going into the ground at nicea
[39:22] you know
[39:23] down through the dark ages
[39:25] see it sprang up
[39:28] right
[39:29] here's jesus christ it came he was the
[39:31] grain of wheat he went into the ground
[39:33] come forth so that the churches could
[39:35] come all right then see in the bride of
[39:37] christ she started out on the dead
[39:39] pentecost
[39:40] a great masterpiece family a great thing
[39:43] on that day of pentecost on that book of
[39:45] acts
[39:46] all right but not long afterwards you
[39:48] see it dwindling down
[39:51] because what had spoken of him as i said
[39:53] this morning compound meaning come down
[39:55] to revelation
[39:56] the corner wheat that fall went into the
[39:58] ground
[39:59] it would have abide alone but it he went
[40:02] in the ground he come forth in a
[40:03] multiple form and a bride
[40:05] right so now
[40:07] she's going into the ground
[40:10] the church
[40:11] at nazi of rome he said well now brother
[40:14] dale i don't agree with you that the
[40:15] right will your prophets when it said it
[40:16] so you're going to argue with him
[40:18] i mean
[40:19] that
[40:20] the bride should've never went to nausea
[40:24] she messed up
[40:26] then
[40:27] he said well the real bride didn't well
[40:28] now you
[40:30] you got a problem there because you got
[40:31] the message to face but i've heard those
[40:34] doctrines and things and people say the
[40:36] real bride never done it
[40:39] well i solved that by a simple question
[40:42] of like
[40:44] uh
[40:47] where did we come from
[40:50] everybody sitting here
[40:52] come out of a denomination
[40:55] at one time or another
[40:57] or maybe was never any even was your own
[40:59] one
[41:01] but see that
[41:03] that goes to solve a lot of the problems
[41:06] i'll get back to that
[41:07] but we know that it was promised as we
[41:10] read in
[41:11] in hosea
[41:13] that
[41:14] after
[41:16] two days
[41:17] he would come forth again and it would
[41:20] be a
[41:21] former lighter rain you know
[41:23] a teaching rain
[41:25] harvest rain
[41:26] and it would be the same as we've
[41:28] already previously covered some
[41:30] of joel where it says
[41:32] you know
[41:36] i will restore
[41:38] the years of the cankerworm bomberworm
[41:39] locust caterpillar
[41:42] the prophet on the message of
[41:44] restoration of the bride tree if you
[41:46] read that message
[41:48] he covers that
[41:50] there were four great
[41:54] messengers
[41:56] took down the tree
[42:00] and they were the messengers of death
[42:02] that destroyed that
[42:04] and then when we come on over you can
[42:06] read it you know paragraph
[42:08] 40504 and go through and you can read
[42:11] down through it looking at it four
[42:12] messengers of death destroyed it
[42:15] the church started out beautiful it was
[42:17] a wonderful church
[42:19] in the book of acts
[42:21] you know god dealing with them and
[42:23] working among them
[42:24] but it wasn't long it started dwindling
[42:26] away
[42:28] and even there in the book of acts they
[42:30] had things already creeping in
[42:32] that was taking the real bride and
[42:34] deceiving her
[42:36] and then when you come to the
[42:37] restoration of the bride tree he says
[42:38] there's four messengers of death
[42:41] and they took off the bark the leaves
[42:44] uh the sap out of the
[42:46] tree the things
[42:47] and it went right down into the roots
[42:50] all right and then in the dark ages it
[42:52] laid there for all of that time
[42:55] kind of you know about a thousand years
[42:59] as it did then there was four messengers
[43:01] of life would come back
[43:03] to bring the tree back to the way it was
[43:05] supposed to be to fulfill joy
[43:07] which would
[43:08] one would restore the leaves one would
[43:10] restore the bark one would destroy the
[43:12] sap you know
[43:13] the life the different things and as it
[43:15] would be the prophet covers that
[43:18] see luther
[43:20] with the just shall live by faith
[43:23] would start off and
[43:25] what's god going to do now
[43:29] he's going to rebuild a masterpiece
[43:34] he's going to bring forth a church in
[43:36] the last days as a masterpiece
[43:39] all right and he starts with luther of
[43:41] the just shall live by faith
[43:44] and he brings that message see that's
[43:46] where we believe what luther taught her
[43:48] the truth
[43:50] now not the other things that he taught
[43:52] that the jews were to be taken out and
[43:53] be killed or whatever but remember
[43:55] he was not he was a church-age messenger
[43:58] but he was not
[43:59] a word prophet that was spoken of to to
[44:02] come forth but it was spoken of that he
[44:04] would come forth and he did because he
[44:06] was a messenger to the h
[44:08] and then wesley comes along and he
[44:10] starts on more of restoring
[44:15] and then azusa street comes along you
[44:17] know 1906
[44:19] of the the pentecostals and they're
[44:21] restoring which was the baptism of the
[44:23] holy ghost
[44:25] but that's not the end of it because
[44:29] it would come forth then that they would
[44:31] have to be a
[44:33] messenger to bring the word
[44:36] back to the original condition
[44:40] now remember the original one seed that
[44:43] went into the ground
[44:47] was the lord jesus christ
[44:49] he was the son of man because we read
[44:52] there in the scripture
[44:54] you know when the son of man to be
[44:55] glorified
[44:57] all right then what are we looking for
[44:59] to come forth in the last days
[45:02] okay
[45:04] it's going to have to come back to
[45:06] the son of man
[45:08] all right and that was the first message
[45:10] i preached in 1969
[45:15] is the bride of jesus christ would be
[45:17] the son of man
[45:18] and i believe that right i believe it's
[45:21] 10 i believe it a whole lot more now
[45:23] and
[45:24] but thinking about it
[45:26] see that one grain of wheat went into
[45:28] the ground
[45:31] and then it come forth into a bride
[45:34] in the book of acts and a thing but in a
[45:36] little bit it wasn't long till that same
[45:38] corn of wheat
[45:39] now
[45:40] the wheat corn wheat it went into the
[45:42] ground which jesus would be the same
[45:44] jesus that would be going into the
[45:46] ground again right
[45:48] where would he be in bright form
[45:51] that we're talking about this morning a
[45:52] body thou hast prepared me
[45:55] all right the bride of jesus christ has
[45:57] to provide him a body
[45:59] for him to live in all right he was
[46:01] happy to dwell in martin luther because
[46:04] of the great message that he was
[46:06] bringing others shall live by faith
[46:08] which is part of the word of god
[46:11] all right
[46:12] john wesley began to speak of
[46:14] sanctification a greater
[46:16] deeper depth and more understanding
[46:19] and that was wonderful
[46:22] because he was going to restore but you
[46:24] can't call that
[46:27] justification you don't speak of it
[46:29] being the son of man
[46:31] and that's why i've always said to you
[46:33] you go back and check it
[46:35] that you've got matthew mark luke and
[46:37] john
[46:38] writing of jesus's life
[46:41] and they speak of the son of man
[46:43] you know right who thou who the man
[46:45] satisfied i am he was constantly
[46:48] but even the great apostle paul
[46:51] he never mentioned son of man
[46:56] the writers there in the bible
[46:58] other than i'm saying now matthew mark
[47:00] luke and john
[47:02] but when it comes into the writings of
[47:04] the scriptures the great wonderful
[47:06] things are coming forth and i believe
[47:08] now this is brother dale right now okay
[47:12] i believe paul
[47:14] understood some about that son of man
[47:18] i believe that
[47:19] go to the great depth he was in the word
[47:22] but yet it was not the time for it to be
[47:24] spoken of
[47:26] it was not the hour for it to be done
[47:28] martin luther maybe had studied about
[47:31] the son of man
[47:32] because anybody read matthew mark luke
[47:34] john didn't know the word son of my hand
[47:35] is in there you know and they they would
[47:37] talk about that but yet it was not the
[47:39] hour to understand that
[47:42] uh sanctification the method is coming
[47:45] along and your presbyterians your
[47:47] baptists your your things see coming
[47:50] forth
[47:51] but it's not much said about that
[47:54] not saying they didn't read it or even
[47:56] talk about it
[47:57] but i'm just saying it was not the hour
[47:59] for that to be done
[48:00] all right then azusa street strikes with
[48:02] the gifts and the things
[48:05] and not a lot is said about the son of
[48:06] man probably through that one god it's
[48:08] not time
[48:09] but you go back and you pick up brother
[48:11] random and when he starts out
[48:13] immediately
[48:15] you know
[48:16] right in the first of his ministry
[48:19] in the 40s you know
[48:21] coming into the 50s
[48:23] he starts talking about
[48:26] the son of man
[48:29] and he started talking about the
[48:31] resurrection sign
[48:34] well that's what the son of man had see
[48:36] he went down he rose
[48:38] all right
[48:41] see then coming forth as his ministry
[48:43] progresses
[48:46] throughout
[48:47] he starts meets bringing more
[48:50] more about the son of man
[48:53] tying it together seeing it unveil
[48:57] it's like i was talking with some of
[48:58] them
[48:59] uh yesterday or day before one about it
[49:01] see brother random like in
[49:04] restoration of the bride tree this
[49:06] wonderful message he brings
[49:09] but yet
[49:11] he kind of seems to
[49:13] bring it up so
[49:14] far he talks about the bride
[49:18] now she'd be restored
[49:20] what she would be
[49:21] did she be the word made flesh
[49:24] because i believe that i i believe he
[49:26] knew that
[49:27] but he's not mentioning certain things
[49:30] that you see him later on as he
[49:34] begins to talk about it all right
[49:37] i believe he had progressive revelation
[49:40] now a lot of people don't like word
[49:41] progressive well i ain't got no sense
[49:43] figure out why i wouldn't like it
[49:46] to me progressive means that you're
[49:48] advancing right that's that's the best
[49:51] now if that ain't the definition for
[49:52] progressive
[49:53] i don't know what you you'd call it but
[49:57] i believe that it began to unfold
[50:01] unto him
[50:03] and he began to speak of
[50:05] and see
[50:07] the great things that he saw and like i
[50:09] said what i do
[50:10] is i take something here and i bring it
[50:12] up to here
[50:14] all right
[50:15] but you'll see it after a while that i
[50:17] take something here and i bring it up to
[50:19] here
[50:21] all right then i start and i bring it up
[50:24] and i'll bring it to here
[50:27] it keeps advancing in what i'm talking
[50:29] about
[50:30] you know
[50:31] because i was preaching these things
[50:33] back in the 70s all right but now it's
[50:36] progressing more and more and more of
[50:39] understanding and i believe that was
[50:41] what the bible is the way it's written
[50:44] and i believe that's the way brother
[50:45] adam was speaking
[50:46] all right and as he does then he coming
[50:49] forth explaining the word
[50:54] he's explaining
[50:56] what that corn of wheat is
[50:58] and he calls that corn of wheat
[51:01] in leadership he says
[51:04] that corn of wheat
[51:05] the bridegroom
[51:10] then he takes the life of that
[51:12] bridegroom
[51:15] and he keeps coming forth
[51:17] and it keeps unveiling
[51:19] all right then he begins to get into
[51:21] like masterpiece
[51:23] in 64.
[51:25] and he begins to talk about the stages
[51:28] he'd always spoke of it
[51:31] especially in like restoration of the
[51:32] bright tree
[51:34] he spoke of those
[51:35] four taking it down
[51:37] for bringing it back
[51:39] well see there's a lot of people in this
[51:40] message in the early
[51:42] days they they come up with a
[51:44] thought that they really thought they
[51:45] were smart
[51:47] and uh maybe they were and i was dumb
[51:49] but uh they said four is an antichrist
[51:52] number
[51:53] you remember that some of your older
[51:55] ones
[51:56] four's antichrist
[51:59] yeah that's all right
[52:01] the fourth restoration amen
[52:04] now see
[52:07] four's restoration see
[52:10] because four brings you back to the
[52:11] original
[52:13] that went into the ground
[52:14] all right
[52:15] that's
[52:16] restoration so you know
[52:19] uh i don't know i can't remember now
[52:21] where we have it we used to have a cross
[52:22] down here i don't know where it's there
[52:24] or not but you know like the prophet
[52:26] said one day he said the catholics don't
[52:28] have an option on the cross
[52:30] i mean we put up a cross in our house
[52:32] does it mean we're catholic
[52:34] you know
[52:36] no
[52:37] but listen
[52:40] the prophet is he gets into masterpiece
[52:44] he begins to talk about this masterpiece
[52:46] family
[52:48] and he begins to talk about
[52:51] luther bringing the joshua by faith
[52:54] wesley bringing sanctification
[52:56] pentecostals bringing
[52:59] the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:01] he said and then in the end time that
[53:03] was to come back to the original seed
[53:06] they went in the ground which would be
[53:07] the word
[53:08] and we were talking this morning that
[53:11] as john the baptist introduced the word
[53:14] which is jesus
[53:16] this prophet introduced the word
[53:19] which would be in you and i
[53:21] all right
[53:22] now
[53:24] as it's talking about it then you know
[53:26] what he went through he went through the
[53:27] the the little stalks coming up
[53:31] and he said see
[53:33] we've got wheat there growing
[53:36] and then he'd talk about how it would go
[53:38] into the next stage and
[53:40] he'd say that's sweet growing
[53:43] you know did he talk about it going into
[53:45] the next stage you know to the shuck and
[53:47] he'd say we got wheat growing and he'd
[53:49] say
[53:51] then you got to look down into that husk
[53:53] you know to shuck
[53:55] he said you can find this a little bitty
[53:57] specula
[53:58] he said that's the word
[54:01] as it begins to unfold
[54:03] or back toward the original seed
[54:06] all right then in doing it
[54:08] he shows it and i don't want you to
[54:10] forget this
[54:14] when that's talk when that two little
[54:15] shoots come out of the ground
[54:17] you can call that wheat
[54:20] but it doesn't look like
[54:22] the one that went into the ground but
[54:23] it's weed
[54:25] you don't plant corn and get a wheat
[54:30] you know when that was green
[54:33] that was original that's right
[54:36] all right right it don't come up brown
[54:39] comes up green
[54:41] then the little stalk comes up
[54:43] the little stalk doesn't come up brown
[54:46] it comes up green
[54:48] well you know what the two little
[54:49] especially saying corn
[54:51] because we're better more apt to talk
[54:53] about raising corn
[54:56] when it comes up to the stalk the stalk
[54:58] is green
[55:00] and even the
[55:02] um
[55:04] silks coming off of it
[55:06] you know we called it fodder in our days
[55:08] that was
[55:11] all of that the leaves they're green
[55:15] it doesn't die
[55:19] and the next one come forth as we look
[55:21] at it
[55:23] when you come around to the time and
[55:25] your corn is on there and it comes up to
[55:27] a
[55:28] to a shuck
[55:30] you say man i've got corn
[55:33] well you've got to wait until it comes
[55:35] in there and then but after a while you
[55:37] know it gets beautiful it's
[55:39] but you know what the shuck is still
[55:41] green
[55:43] right
[55:45] and you pull it off right then and
[55:47] boil it man you got something good to
[55:49] eat
[55:50] but you can't plant it
[55:54] right
[55:56] but until that
[55:58] stalk
[55:59] all of that has to remain green
[56:02] because life is there
[56:06] but then
[56:07] when the corn forms
[56:11] you don't cut the chalk down
[56:16] just because it's formed and you can
[56:17] take it off and eat it but you don't
[56:19] want to do that because you can't plant
[56:20] that
[56:22] but if you'll leave it there and that's
[56:23] the way we used to do brother howell
[56:25] back there
[56:26] was a farmer enough and some of you
[56:28] that
[56:29] we would go out and we would really cut
[56:31] the top out of it and leave the stalk
[56:33] and the ears standing on the
[56:35] you know
[56:37] costco we'd take the tops and feed them
[56:39] to the cattle
[56:41] or horses
[56:42] and uh
[56:46] you leave that for a long time
[56:51] because that stalk is still green
[56:54] it may not look too green but it still
[56:56] is
[56:58] but you don't go gather it to
[57:00] throw it in a barn
[57:03] until
[57:04] all of that stalk and everything
[57:07] is virtually dried up
[57:10] all right then you can take the corn put
[57:13] it in a
[57:14] barn
[57:15] and you can keep it and in the winter
[57:17] time you can take it and take it down
[57:19] and have cornmeal
[57:21] but if you do it too early what are you
[57:22] going to do
[57:25] you pull it too early
[57:27] you got corn yeah big old
[57:29] you know we just took ours and throw it
[57:31] over into a bin
[57:33] you throw it over in there and it still
[57:35] got green in it
[57:36] and uh
[57:37] and it longed to you got a rotten mess
[57:40] right
[57:42] it just doesn't do right
[57:43] so you got to wait until everything is
[57:45] dry
[57:47] and that's what i mean
[57:49] until and i believe the prophet is
[57:51] explaining it in the masterpiece until
[57:53] that
[57:54] corn is back to the original which would
[57:58] be capable of planting
[58:01] when we pulled it off the stalk to store
[58:03] it in the barn it was capable really of
[58:06] planting it
[58:08] because if it wasn't then it was rotten
[58:10] on you
[58:12] it had to dry
[58:14] and we'd leave it to way up in the
[58:15] wintertime
[58:17] because it didn't hurt nothing
[58:19] and we go out in november december or
[58:21] somewhere
[58:22] you know we gather it up put it in the
[58:24] barn then
[58:26] but you understand what i'm saying
[58:28] a lot of people think she just brought
[58:29] around the way he covered it that
[58:31] denomination he just dried up and died
[58:34] after nominated dried up and died
[58:39] well
[58:42] yes to me you got a problem because
[58:47] brother branham said what was the tape
[58:50] 58
[58:52] right around and said the baptist has
[58:54] just now become a denomination
[58:58] remember that
[59:01] well i thought the baptist's become a
[59:03] nation about i mean a denomination about
[59:05] 200 years ago
[59:08] and you know as a whole a lot of it did
[59:15] but you better remember one thing as i
[59:18] said while ago
[59:21] the prophet will cover the minute was
[59:23] carriers
[59:25] of the life
[59:27] ain't no denomination with no carrier
[59:30] you don't know what you're talking about
[59:34] you're running a blabber mouth it ain't
[59:35] gonna work
[59:38] but listen
[59:40] if it wasn't a carrier where'd you come
[59:42] from
[59:46] brother dick where did you come from
[59:48] presbyterian
[59:50] right
[59:52] we come baptists
[59:55] some of you catholic
[59:58] bless god ain't nothing in that
[1:00:01] that's what i mean you're trying your
[1:00:03] best to make a doctor and it won't fit
[1:00:06] biblically nor will it fit naturally
[1:00:09] so the best thing to do is just read
[1:00:10] what brother branham says and believe it
[1:00:17] and believe what he's saying instead of
[1:00:19] trying to figure out
[1:00:24] well i just can't see that i was talking
[1:00:25] to two brothers
[1:00:27] out deer hunting one time and
[1:00:30] one of them he had got everything when
[1:00:32] he believed
[1:00:34] he's packed up ready to go and
[1:00:36] the other one said he didn't get nothing
[1:00:38] and all got his anointing and one of
[1:00:40] these days we're gonna get something and
[1:00:42] i said well brothers do y'all mind if i
[1:00:44] kind of stay in the between
[1:00:47] i said that's what i don't understand
[1:00:48] when he went that way one went that away
[1:00:50] i said all right with you if i just stay
[1:00:51] in the middle
[1:00:54] and i said that way i can follow it and
[1:00:57] and all and i said then i can quote
[1:00:59] brother branham
[1:01:01] and what i had done i had made a quote
[1:01:02] where brother brown said he met people
[1:01:04] with the holy ghost 50 years before him
[1:01:06] just exactly like the day of pentecost
[1:01:10] and both of them denied it
[1:01:14] preachers in this message they both said
[1:01:16] no that ain't right i said well
[1:01:19] you go tell him
[1:01:21] that it ain't right you know he's the
[1:01:25] one that said it
[1:01:28] but you see my point is
[1:01:32] there is a way to approach anything
[1:01:35] but if we approach it wrong we will
[1:01:37] automatically go in the wrong direction
[1:01:41] sure
[1:01:42] when martin luther brought the message
[1:01:46] there was a lot of people back there
[1:01:48] that literally died
[1:01:50] spiritually speaking
[1:01:54] but there was a lot of people like you
[1:01:56] know that wesley come from luther's
[1:01:58] message
[1:02:00] do you know your history
[1:02:01] a little you know that wesley was on his
[1:02:04] way to america
[1:02:06] to he was a missionary under
[1:02:09] the justified
[1:02:11] and he was coming to america and the
[1:02:13] moravians
[1:02:15] introduced to him the doctrine of
[1:02:17] sanctification he goes back home and he
[1:02:19] says lo i go to america to convert to
[1:02:22] heather and found out i needed to be
[1:02:24] converted
[1:02:27] see he didn't have any problem
[1:02:29] you can't people of this message don't
[1:02:31] want to talk about anything related to
[1:02:33] organization or denomination because
[1:02:35] they're scared to death
[1:02:39] but you know if it wouldn't for them
[1:02:40] right now taking care of us
[1:02:43] we'd done been having a lot of
[1:02:46] that's problems
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:50] i told them here to church one day i
[1:02:51] said i'm not a member of the national
[1:02:52] rifle association but i'm glad they got
[1:02:55] it
[1:02:57] the reason i'm not is they
[1:02:59] made me upset because he kept sending me
[1:03:02] bills that i didn't know
[1:03:04] you know i just called him up and don't
[1:03:05] take my name off
[1:03:07] i mean they were sarcastic about it and
[1:03:10] i had papers
[1:03:12] to prove you know i had done paid my
[1:03:14] dues for a long time and they were being
[1:03:16] sarcastic about it if you don't pay this
[1:03:19] i said well what did you just do me a
[1:03:21] favor take my name off your books
[1:03:24] but i'm saying if it wasn't for the
[1:03:25] national rifle association you didn't
[1:03:26] lost the rights of your guns
[1:03:29] so they're here to protect us
[1:03:32] you look after and you see the stalk
[1:03:33] standing there
[1:03:35] and you see an ear of corn starting to
[1:03:37] form if the stalk didn't stay there
[1:03:42] you can't hang your corn out in mid-air
[1:03:44] they don't have sky hooks
[1:03:47] right
[1:03:51] but the point of that is each one of
[1:03:53] those
[1:03:54] is green and stays green until the
[1:03:58] harvesting
[1:04:03] when it gets time to harvest
[1:04:05] then you can say everything's died and
[1:04:07] my way of saying it whatever you want to
[1:04:10] say about it but around said the baptist
[1:04:12] has just now become a denomination you
[1:04:14] know what
[1:04:14] they turned down this message
[1:04:16] that's right
[1:04:20] i believe that's when the methodists the
[1:04:21] baptists the presbyterian the
[1:04:22] pentecostals the catholics the oneness
[1:04:25] is the two this isn't a foreign
[1:04:26] assistant how many else
[1:04:28] when they turned down this message
[1:04:31] they were dying
[1:04:33] now there was a lot of people died down
[1:04:34] there a long time ago because it
[1:04:36] wouldn't have nothing to do with truth
[1:04:38] but they were good people
[1:04:40] that wanted to know truth and wanted to
[1:04:42] stay and you go talk to people there's
[1:04:44] good people out there that love the lord
[1:04:47] jesus christ
[1:04:49] you don't believe this message out
[1:04:53] well when are you going to get in
[1:04:57] right
[1:04:59] come on
[1:05:02] luther
[1:05:04] preach to joshua live by faith
[1:05:06] wesley stood on that
[1:05:10] and believed that
[1:05:12] and god brought him the message of
[1:05:13] sanctification
[1:05:17] there was a little line of truth coming
[1:05:19] down through all of it right they kept
[1:05:22] it alive whereas the majority of the
[1:05:24] world died and was gone
[1:05:28] you can't do that what are you going to
[1:05:29] do in a minute when we read it brother
[1:05:30] ryan said their denominations were
[1:05:32] carriers
[1:05:37] what about when he said the prophets
[1:05:39] were carrier
[1:05:43] what's he talking about
[1:05:46] that seems odd doesn't it
[1:05:48] but remember the stages each stage has
[1:05:51] to be there
[1:05:54] what was come through brother brown said
[1:05:56] in the rapture come up through luther
[1:05:59] was what made
[1:06:02] wesley what came up through
[1:06:06] wesley was what made pentecost
[1:06:08] what came up through pentecost is what
[1:06:10] makes the people
[1:06:12] of the last
[1:06:16] days and i didn't make these quotes
[1:06:20] brother brown said you pentecostals he
[1:06:22] said if you won't go in
[1:06:25] he said god will raise up baptist and
[1:06:27] methodist and take them in
[1:06:29] well i'm looking at them
[1:06:33] very few of you come through pentecost
[1:06:37] and probably out there on the internet
[1:06:38] that i'm talking to today very few of
[1:06:40] you come through pentecost
[1:06:42] you come from a methodist or a baptist
[1:06:44] or a presbyterian or
[1:06:45] some kind of eye anyway
[1:06:49] but church
[1:06:51] it's got life as long as it's a carrier
[1:06:56] you follow me amen
[1:06:59] the chutes coming up green
[1:07:02] when it moved on
[1:07:03] those didn't fall off
[1:07:08] see you want everybody to try to say oh
[1:07:11] if you don't believe this message you're
[1:07:12] going to die and go to hell all right
[1:07:14] let me quote brother branham i love to
[1:07:16] do that because it's true he said word
[1:07:17] rejectors go to hell
[1:07:20] i'll agree with that
[1:07:22] but don't make fun of nobody
[1:07:27] i don't make fun of no methodist baptist
[1:07:28] this man right across here what they
[1:07:30] believe you know what he's doing he's
[1:07:32] watching wade on statue of a perfect man
[1:07:36] and said man i've never seen it like
[1:07:38] that
[1:07:40] he said he thought he got everything he
[1:07:41] believed
[1:07:43] you know
[1:07:45] he didn't know there was a growth into
[1:07:46] things well okay
[1:07:49] there's good people in this world
[1:07:53] that are searching for truth
[1:07:55] but who's blinding him
[1:07:57] is what jesus said about the pharisees
[1:07:59] he said you stand in the door are you
[1:08:01] preachers
[1:08:04] he said you won't go in and said you
[1:08:06] won't let them go in
[1:08:10] do you see in this message
[1:08:11] you leave this church boy bless god
[1:08:13] you're out of it
[1:08:15] you've got to come to this church
[1:08:18] but when i say that you better get up
[1:08:19] and run
[1:08:21] because you better realize that there's
[1:08:23] some kind of big booger man got a hold
[1:08:24] of me to make me say it because it ain't
[1:08:26] done it with 40 something years
[1:08:31] but now listen
[1:08:33] a carrier is a person
[1:08:35] that carries is that simple that's
[1:08:38] webster all right
[1:08:40] now
[1:08:41] why would brother branham then talk
[1:08:43] about
[1:08:44] that he's
[1:08:46] bringing this up and he'd already spoken
[1:08:48] as i said restoration of bride tree and
[1:08:50] talk about how that it comes back to the
[1:08:52] original
[1:08:53] but then when he gets to masterpiece
[1:08:56] he starts talking about
[1:08:59] carriers
[1:09:04] carriers
[1:09:07] well can't you see that's what i was
[1:09:08] talking about the illustration of giving
[1:09:11] the stalk has to remain because it's a
[1:09:13] carrier
[1:09:16] the shock has to protect the corn
[1:09:18] to keep it from where dawn the son will
[1:09:20] kill it
[1:09:22] it's a carrier
[1:09:26] you know what brother branham said about
[1:09:27] it said masterpiece he said when the
[1:09:29] bride begins to say
[1:09:31] i and my father are one and these other
[1:09:35] things he says he said to shuck will
[1:09:38] pull away
[1:09:40] well all right let's start saying i and
[1:09:43] my father are one
[1:09:45] until we can believe it's it
[1:09:48] 40 years i've said it so i don't mind
[1:09:50] saying it again
[1:09:55] it's not when we realize what brother
[1:09:57] branham was
[1:09:58] is when we realize what we are
[1:10:01] because we can only do that by his
[1:10:03] message
[1:10:06] the people in luther's day could only
[1:10:08] realize that just shall live by faith
[1:10:10] because martin luther had brought the
[1:10:12] message
[1:10:16] so is it now
[1:10:18] what a greater honor could you give to a
[1:10:20] man
[1:10:21] than to tell him i'm depending upon what
[1:10:23] you had to say
[1:10:27] in believing that you know what he
[1:10:30] talked about in in the stages he talked
[1:10:33] about how that there were three women
[1:10:35] back there that were used and he talked
[1:10:37] about hagar
[1:10:39] you remember
[1:10:40] the concubine wife of
[1:10:42] abraham
[1:10:45] and he talked about
[1:10:47] sarah
[1:10:49] and he typed hagar's justification
[1:10:52] sarah sanctification
[1:10:55] and then he said then there was a mary
[1:10:58] he said the first two were by
[1:11:01] human relationship to bring forth a
[1:11:03] child
[1:11:04] but he said mary
[1:11:07] it was not so
[1:11:09] because mary said be it unto me
[1:11:11] according to thy word without any
[1:11:13] relationship to bring forth see
[1:11:16] well that's a beautiful thing
[1:11:19] that's wonderful
[1:11:23] but what about when he gets on over pull
[1:11:25] up let's go over and jump just a little
[1:11:28] pull up number eight if you can 97 98
[1:11:31] the masterpiece save them to read all
[1:11:33] these i can scan down if you want them
[1:11:35] be glad let you have them
[1:11:39] but look what he says
[1:11:44] just like paul here this is paragraph
[1:11:47] 97 98 2.
[1:11:50] see not out with a shock 65 to 18. just
[1:11:53] like paul said here did not the seed of
[1:11:56] the of the free woman or the bond woman
[1:11:58] persecute the seed of the free one
[1:12:00] so does the seed of denomination
[1:12:02] persecute the genuine grain
[1:12:04] it's always got to be that way they'll
[1:12:06] not be heirs together
[1:12:08] and and i always say to you it's kind of
[1:12:10] funny to me
[1:12:11] why did he title that message that
[1:12:20] when did he title it the seed
[1:12:22] shall not be air with the shock
[1:12:28] when really it's to shuck
[1:12:30] that cannot be air
[1:12:32] with a seed
[1:12:35] right
[1:12:38] but yet he
[1:12:39] that wouldn't fit the way he explained
[1:12:41] it
[1:12:44] so he explained the seed is not air with
[1:12:46] a shot that's right
[1:12:48] why because a shot will go into their
[1:12:50] denomination the shot will dry up the
[1:12:53] stock will dry up et cetera
[1:12:56] and won't go in
[1:12:57] with the seed
[1:13:00] so he was exactly right
[1:13:02] but his oddity he said it that way
[1:13:05] once and so does the seat of the
[1:13:07] denomination persecute the genuine grain
[1:13:09] always got to be that way they'll not be
[1:13:11] ours together they're not associated
[1:13:13] together they're absolutely two
[1:13:14] different promises two different times
[1:13:16] two different people all together one is
[1:13:18] the bride the other one is the church
[1:13:20] no comparison at all with them
[1:13:24] now watch him
[1:13:25] but still they're not the seed that's
[1:13:27] promised to come
[1:13:30] neither was sarah
[1:13:33] neither neither was hagar
[1:13:36] neither sarah was
[1:13:38] or neither mary
[1:13:41] was the seed
[1:13:44] okay mary was mary was not the seed
[1:13:49] she was a carrier of the seat
[1:13:56] more than pentecostals probably was
[1:13:59] foaming at the mouth
[1:14:01] because they knew that he was typing
[1:14:04] mary as pentecost he does in masterpiece
[1:14:06] right
[1:14:09] you mean mary wasn't seed
[1:14:13] now what's he saying
[1:14:18] we heard him but what does he mean
[1:14:21] let me know what he said okay i agree
[1:14:23] with you you know what he said because
[1:14:24] he said what he meant
[1:14:27] but then what is it still what's the
[1:14:28] answer
[1:14:30] why would he say mary is not the seed
[1:14:36] because mary carried the seed
[1:14:40] right
[1:14:41] mary was not god
[1:14:44] the seed is the original seed which is
[1:14:47] the son of man
[1:14:48] which is the word
[1:14:53] mary was not
[1:14:56] god
[1:14:58] if you read masterpiece you've heard
[1:14:59] that over and over
[1:15:02] she was a carrier
[1:15:05] see how beautiful he's explaining it
[1:15:08] that's not throwing off on the carriers
[1:15:13] i got that wrote in here two or three
[1:15:15] times
[1:15:16] to make sure and explain it so i write
[1:15:18] down explain and when i do that that
[1:15:20] means i figure you don't understand what
[1:15:22] i'm trying to say so explain it all
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:26] mary was not god
[1:15:31] she carried god within her
[1:15:36] and she gave fourth birth
[1:15:39] right
[1:15:42] but she was not god
[1:15:43] god was in mary
[1:15:47] she was
[1:15:52] the carrier
[1:15:55] of the life
[1:16:00] and that's azusa street pentecost
[1:16:02] carrier
[1:16:04] of the life
[1:16:07] so that means there's got to be somebody
[1:16:09] now on earth
[1:16:11] to make manifest
[1:16:14] the seed
[1:16:16] original
[1:16:18] jesus made it manifest
[1:16:21] he was the corn of wheat that went into
[1:16:23] the ground he made it manifest he was
[1:16:25] the son of man
[1:16:28] i won't get there this afternoon but
[1:16:32] you know if i preached in 69 i sure got
[1:16:34] a whole lot more quotes now
[1:16:37] that the bride of jesus christ is the
[1:16:39] son of man
[1:16:45] he said no that can't be called brother
[1:16:46] brown was eight right but brother
[1:16:48] brown's in the body of christ over here
[1:16:50] remember this morning a little you know
[1:16:54] he's part of the body of christ in the
[1:16:55] end time
[1:16:57] i didn't say these things he did
[1:17:01] we must become the original grain that
[1:17:03] went into the ground
[1:17:05] but it's not going to be a rapture
[1:17:07] of a premature seed
[1:17:11] it's got to be back totally grand
[1:17:13] totally dried totally everything all the
[1:17:16] denominations got to die
[1:17:18] should it be that so look what he's
[1:17:19] saying
[1:17:22] no comparison but there's still a seed
[1:17:23] that's the promise but look what he says
[1:17:27] sarah neither neither was hagar neither
[1:17:29] was sarah or anita was mary was the seed
[1:17:31] mary was not the seed she was a carrier
[1:17:34] of the seed but she had nurtured brought
[1:17:36] forth out of her womb
[1:17:38] just like the shuck brought forth from
[1:17:41] its wound
[1:17:42] you see what he's what is don't die and
[1:17:45] rotten away and and do like we think
[1:17:49] brought forth out of the her womb just
[1:17:51] like the shuck brought forth from his
[1:17:53] wound the real seed but the shuck is not
[1:17:55] the seed
[1:17:57] it closes to cl it's closer to the seed
[1:18:01] it's hugged around it
[1:18:03] way back in the stalk the life is
[1:18:05] scattered all through the stalk
[1:18:07] the life is still in the stalk
[1:18:11] the thing
[1:18:12] and when it comes to the pollen
[1:18:15] it's gathered down closer but when it
[1:18:16] comes to the shuck it's right down here
[1:18:18] like the seed and forms it almost like
[1:18:21] the seed my wife will tell me when we're
[1:18:24] raising corn she says honey keep close
[1:18:27] check on it now
[1:18:29] cause them
[1:18:30] silks are turning
[1:18:34] any of you farmers enough to know what i
[1:18:35] mean
[1:18:37] you go out there and you got a beautiful
[1:18:39] ear
[1:18:40] looks beautiful
[1:18:43] but the telltale sign is right up in the
[1:18:45] top
[1:18:46] where the silks are sticking out
[1:18:48] wait till they turn
[1:18:51] oh you can get a little bit of corn but
[1:18:53] wait till they turn
[1:18:55] before you start trying to pull it
[1:18:58] looks good don't it formed it almost
[1:18:59] like the seed jesus told us what would
[1:19:02] be in the last days
[1:19:04] be so close it would deceive the very
[1:19:07] elected if possible
[1:19:08] but then the seed comes forth from there
[1:19:11] and the shook the life leaves the shuck
[1:19:14] the shuck is a carrier and that's just
[1:19:16] exactly what our denominations has been
[1:19:20] he didn't have any problems saying it
[1:19:23] a carrier luther wesley pentecostal now
[1:19:26] it's time for the seed to come forth
[1:19:31] he has no problem with calling mary and
[1:19:33] saying that she's not a seed well
[1:19:36] because she's not god i keep saying that
[1:19:38] because if you're reading the message
[1:19:39] that's what he's saying
[1:19:41] mary wasn't god she had god inside of
[1:19:43] her
[1:19:44] you and i are not god
[1:19:48] we're the children of god
[1:19:51] we're his offspring yet but inside of
[1:19:54] that is what you're talking about
[1:19:55] outside of here i'm still samuel dale
[1:20:03] until this is changed
[1:20:07] i don't have a body like under his
[1:20:08] glorious body
[1:20:10] i still got the stinking rotten one i'm
[1:20:12] born with
[1:20:15] but
[1:20:16] mary you read it all over and over and
[1:20:19] over
[1:20:20] mary's not the seed
[1:20:23] she's a carrier
[1:20:25] the denominations were carriers
[1:20:29] to carry the life forth a lot of people
[1:20:32] now i'm trying to say that where you'll
[1:20:34] understand
[1:20:35] a lot of the baptists when when
[1:20:38] i can go back there and and deal with
[1:20:40] that because i was there
[1:20:41] and you could start trying to tell some
[1:20:43] of them there was good people there that
[1:20:45] really loved the lord
[1:20:47] but then there was people there that
[1:20:48] would die hide
[1:20:50] born baptists and we gonna stay baptists
[1:20:54] don't even fellowship in guilds were
[1:20:57] they was
[1:20:58] well counting caroline road it was three
[1:21:01] but that's
[1:21:02] with all the regional baptist church
[1:21:05] out of that came forth pine grove
[1:21:08] and out of part of that came
[1:21:10] liberty all right
[1:21:12] there's people that will not go to any
[1:21:14] one of those churches beside their own
[1:21:19] old man there in pine grove he said
[1:21:22] i die don't you letting on them people
[1:21:25] come to my funeral and don't you take me
[1:21:27] to that church down there
[1:21:30] put me here
[1:21:31] that's the way we know what they were
[1:21:33] dead
[1:21:34] that's right
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:36] but there was good people there
[1:21:40] right there's still good people out
[1:21:43] there in them denominations
[1:21:46] they're really folks come on and i don't
[1:21:48] play games
[1:21:50] that make us ashamed of ourselves about
[1:21:53] their sincerity
[1:21:55] and do their doings in their love and
[1:21:57] their compassions and things
[1:22:00] that makes lula look ashamed of itself
[1:22:05] that's right
[1:22:06] but that thing of it is
[1:22:08] they can't see the word
[1:22:13] i told you what happened when i left the
[1:22:14] baptist church
[1:22:15] old man he was in his 80s he was just to
[1:22:17] fill in
[1:22:19] and he came and he asked me he said
[1:22:20] what's wrong sam
[1:22:22] because i told the church i was leaving
[1:22:25] he said
[1:22:27] you know what's what's the matter is
[1:22:29] anything wrong probably somebody cause
[1:22:30] problems or whatever i said no i said
[1:22:32] you ever heard of william branham
[1:22:36] this was 1958
[1:22:39] and he was in his 80s so you know
[1:22:41] where he was at
[1:22:43] he said yes sam i've heard of william
[1:22:45] branham
[1:22:46] and he said i will not say one word
[1:22:48] against him
[1:22:51] he said there's other people i'd like
[1:22:52] for you to go talk to
[1:22:54] i said well bring him on be glad too
[1:22:58] but he said i won't say one thing
[1:22:59] against him
[1:23:01] why because he knew
[1:23:04] he knew the truth
[1:23:07] there's good people out there today
[1:23:09] you know the only difference in you and
[1:23:11] me and anybody else is the grace of
[1:23:14] almighty god that has been extended unto
[1:23:17] us to allow us to believe
[1:23:25] i mean
[1:23:26] are we some dna different
[1:23:31] you know
[1:23:34] you know you know what i mean are we
[1:23:36] some kind of something that born
[1:23:37] different
[1:23:39] how come it is just like one out of the
[1:23:40] family somewhere you know
[1:23:42] 13 of us then when one believed it
[1:23:49] see what brought you sister gail to
[1:23:50] where you are
[1:23:55] look at the grace of god that's been
[1:23:57] extended to you and i
[1:23:59] that allowed our eyes to be opened that
[1:24:01] we can see god's word
[1:24:06] i love those people out there
[1:24:09] i have no problems with them
[1:24:11] sometimes i could probably preach free
[1:24:12] or right over there
[1:24:14] to them in that baptist church
[1:24:16] then i can preach here
[1:24:20] i don't mind saying that because i look
[1:24:21] at faces
[1:24:26] and when i see you dried up like a bunch
[1:24:28] of prunes
[1:24:32] and me screaming my heart out trying to
[1:24:34] get you to see the truth
[1:24:38] or snoring
[1:24:42] right well why would brother brown speak
[1:24:45] of the
[1:24:46] mary just being a carrier
[1:24:50] and he would type mary as a zeus street
[1:24:55] which would really tie back to the
[1:24:58] original
[1:24:59] pentecost
[1:25:02] right
[1:25:04] so it's carriers
[1:25:10] carriers of the life
[1:25:13] see
[1:25:16] making the ability for
[1:25:19] the seed to be able to travel up through
[1:25:22] why would you want to cut down anything
[1:25:27] the way the people of this message
[1:25:29] preach today nobody got no hopes outside
[1:25:31] of this message
[1:25:34] when i hear them talk like that i
[1:25:35] think well they ain't got no hopes
[1:25:38] i'm honest i don't mind saying it
[1:25:41] because that's what i think
[1:25:43] when you think you're the only one and
[1:25:45] you got it all just remember brother
[1:25:47] dale will tell you you ain't got it all
[1:25:49] because he ain't got it all day none of
[1:25:51] us got it all
[1:25:53] but i believe around the world
[1:25:55] the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:58] has the ministry
[1:26:00] of jesus christ
[1:26:02] being made manifest
[1:26:07] we just got a little part
[1:26:11] let's just manifest our part
[1:26:14] just to be that part of it
[1:26:16] but see
[1:26:17] sarah wasn't
[1:26:20] the seed
[1:26:23] mary wasn't the seed
[1:26:26] they were carriers
[1:26:28] well all i want to know is now
[1:26:31] then when he gets over to run this
[1:26:32] number one make sure you read it number
[1:26:34] eight a which is the seat shall not be
[1:26:37] aired with the shock 65 429 now this is
[1:26:40] los angeles california
[1:26:42] not in jeffersonville so paragraph 81
[1:26:45] what does he say
[1:26:48] now that same low goss has a part
[1:26:51] he has got a bride and the same logos
[1:26:54] this word that cannot be tampered with
[1:26:56] is brooding over the churches today
[1:26:59] trying to bring the word to its full
[1:27:01] manifestation
[1:27:02] what which the prophets
[1:27:06] was carriers to the seed
[1:27:10] and the church denominations
[1:27:13] has been carriers
[1:27:17] to the seed
[1:27:20] and notice quickly but like the shuck
[1:27:22] hugs holds the seed now
[1:27:24] then it leaves her
[1:27:31] man stood here
[1:27:32] and i had tried my best to show him down
[1:27:34] at lula when he said luther was false
[1:27:37] wesley's fault pentecost was false
[1:27:40] i said brother branham brought it
[1:27:42] and showed what they
[1:27:45] they were the carriers they were the the
[1:27:47] bride of that time he'd come right on up
[1:27:49] here and just stood right here and
[1:27:51] preached that nun and he said
[1:27:54] pentecost and it was just false
[1:27:58] well there was no need of me tackling
[1:27:59] him after church and telling him again
[1:28:01] if he didn't hear it the first time he
[1:28:03] wasn't going to hear it the second time
[1:28:05] but i didn't agree with him
[1:28:10] you know why i don't agree with him and
[1:28:11] you've got to agree with this you
[1:28:14] come out of something
[1:28:19] god allowed what you came out of to be a
[1:28:21] carrier
[1:28:25] even if it's coming out of the churches
[1:28:26] in this message
[1:28:31] they were just carriers
[1:28:33] there's wonderful people in this message
[1:28:37] love the lord jesus wonderful
[1:28:40] but yet they're afraid to move
[1:28:42] they're afraid to venture out be afraid
[1:28:44] to listen to the truth
[1:28:47] freddie might get confused
[1:28:51] then there's a whole bunch of garbage
[1:28:52] kansas just trying their best to confuse
[1:28:54] everybody
[1:29:01] i've asked you to read masterpiece and
[1:29:02] see not already show
[1:29:04] i want you to tell me how many times
[1:29:06] brother brown mentions about matthew 24
[1:29:08] 24.
[1:29:13] and he typed it exactly to
[1:29:15] azusa street pentecost
[1:29:18] which would type exactly
[1:29:20] to the people of this message
[1:29:30] what is matthew 24 24 it just sees the
[1:29:32] very elective as possible ain't no
[1:29:34] baptist method this presbyterian
[1:29:36] catholic pentecostals gonna deceive you
[1:29:38] and i
[1:29:39] but the ones are the garbage cans in
[1:29:41] this message that's got their own ideas
[1:29:43] of the two souls two lords sevens under
[1:29:45] virtue of perusias
[1:29:48] jesus wouldn't gone to the river jordan
[1:29:50] any kind of doctrine they're just all
[1:29:51] kind of doctrines of the message
[1:29:56] blinded in the eyes of the poor people
[1:29:58] because they can't defend themselves i
[1:30:00] cried when i went to the philippines
[1:30:05] they didn't have the ability to argue
[1:30:07] with somebody
[1:30:09] they were just beginning
[1:30:12] to get the books and the tapes
[1:30:14] and people were going over there
[1:30:16] preaching false doctrine saying brother
[1:30:18] branham said well how could they argue
[1:30:21] with him
[1:30:29] he's blind in them that's matthew 24 24.
[1:30:32] it's got to be right up there against
[1:30:34] that seed
[1:30:35] all right
[1:30:37] mary had in her wound
[1:30:42] the seed
[1:30:45] inside of her
[1:30:48] all right
[1:30:49] now
[1:30:52] so you and i must hear the word
[1:30:57] correctly planted
[1:31:00] and have that word in our womb
[1:31:08] before we can talk about being the word
[1:31:11] we can't talk about being the word until
[1:31:13] we give birth to it
[1:31:15] just because we got it in books and
[1:31:17] tapes and can carry it we're just
[1:31:19] another carrier
[1:31:23] right
[1:31:26] and remember logging with carriers
[1:31:29] that's not the original seed
[1:31:33] oh brother dale i love to carry this
[1:31:35] message i do too
[1:31:37] but i want to give birth to this message
[1:31:40] what i can in my own life
[1:31:44] do you know that brother branham
[1:31:47] said that
[1:31:48] mary had a virgin mind
[1:31:54] and a virgin
[1:31:56] womb is that right now
[1:32:01] mary had a virgin mind
[1:32:04] and a virgin wound
[1:32:07] natural physical
[1:32:10] couldn't be just any woman who had to be
[1:32:11] a virgin now but she also had to have
[1:32:13] the virgin mind
[1:32:15] it wasn't for any girl
[1:32:21] and brother randall said she heard the
[1:32:23] word
[1:32:24] from her mother
[1:32:29] and she heard it many days in the temple
[1:32:31] that a virgin shall conceive
[1:32:39] when the angel come to mary he didn't
[1:32:41] say
[1:32:42] mary i want you to know this is isaiah i
[1:32:44] died whatever what is it 9-6 or
[1:32:46] something well they'd always get that
[1:32:47] wrong
[1:32:52] he just simply told her what he come for
[1:32:56] she had an ability to believe god
[1:32:59] which was a virgin mind that had not
[1:33:02] been polluted by the
[1:33:03] pharisees and the sadducees of what the
[1:33:05] messiah was to be
[1:33:07] she believed that it could take place
[1:33:10] she had a virgin mind
[1:33:12] and a virgin wound
[1:33:16] but what if she had a virgin mind with
[1:33:18] no virgin wound
[1:33:20] they couldn't have brought christ
[1:33:24] come on they had to have both of them
[1:33:29] come on spoken words original seed what
[1:33:32] was it
[1:33:33] virgin mind well
[1:33:34] virgin womb for the baby
[1:33:38] virgin mind wound
[1:33:41] right
[1:33:42] um w-o-m-b to be able to come down
[1:33:44] through
[1:33:47] get about 16 18 inches below her head
[1:33:50] and into her heart
[1:33:53] and she said be it unto me
[1:33:57] according to thy word
[1:33:59] no sign no sensations no nothing
[1:34:03] she believed it
[1:34:07] she's our representation
[1:34:12] well brother dad if i could see signs
[1:34:13] and wondered i believe it
[1:34:20] right in the devil's traps
[1:34:23] what
[1:34:25] it's like brother
[1:34:29] now we're talking well ago in the office
[1:34:32] and brother branham would say
[1:34:34] he said it's more been done in one
[1:34:37] service
[1:34:39] in his ministry
[1:34:41] than was done in the book of acts
[1:34:48] right
[1:34:50] he said that not greater
[1:34:53] he said just more done
[1:34:57] why
[1:34:58] i would like for you to do it sometimes
[1:35:00] to take the book of acts
[1:35:03] and read it and write down
[1:35:05] one miracle
[1:35:07] two miracles
[1:35:09] three miracles
[1:35:10] four miracles you know what i mean write
[1:35:12] down every miracle that took place
[1:35:17] and over the 30-something years
[1:35:20] or about 30 years
[1:35:22] it was covered by the book of acts
[1:35:25] you'd have a miracle taking place for
[1:35:27] about every three months
[1:35:31] or probably less
[1:35:35] come on i know it's not
[1:35:37] written i know the bible is not read
[1:35:39] whatever took place i believe that they
[1:35:41] were miracles and every service
[1:35:45] well brother brown said more done
[1:35:47] in one service
[1:35:50] than was done in the book of acts
[1:35:54] he'd stand there and there'd be 20
[1:35:56] people healed
[1:35:58] that's greater than the whole book of
[1:35:59] acts because it's probably not 20 people
[1:36:01] in the book of acts and its recorded was
[1:36:03] healed
[1:36:10] right come on
[1:36:12] read the book of acts and see how many
[1:36:13] miracles and write it down and then
[1:36:15] divide it by 30 years
[1:36:20] but i've told you now i'm saying i
[1:36:21] believe miracles happen in every service
[1:36:24] i don't even think martin when it come
[1:36:26] up to him about the fourth church age
[1:36:29] that he wasn't satisfied with miracles
[1:36:31] happened in every service
[1:36:38] but you see we belittle it to the fact
[1:36:40] that we don't think we see anything
[1:36:42] going on
[1:36:43] you know why
[1:36:46] me talking okay
[1:36:49] is we don't first have a virgin mind
[1:36:54] for to receive
[1:36:56] and realize the word of god and what it
[1:36:59] is
[1:37:01] we've got denominational minds
[1:37:04] and
[1:37:06] luca eight minds
[1:37:09] you know what i mean by that don't you
[1:37:16] somebody's idea
[1:37:19] well don't you think it's this way
[1:37:21] but when are we going to start saying no
[1:37:24] no
[1:37:30] he said no that ain't right
[1:37:34] but you know what we well a little
[1:37:36] brother
[1:37:37] my sister and that's your way of seeing
[1:37:39] it i guess you might no no why not just
[1:37:41] say you ain't right
[1:37:47] if we are the original seed
[1:37:51] brotherhood said i'll be glad
[1:37:53] paul said to look them in the eye and
[1:37:55] say you're not saying what paul said
[1:38:02] you do that with a preacher sometime
[1:38:06] i know what i mean but
[1:38:08] i've seen y'all sometimes do that
[1:38:12] we had a brother came through here
[1:38:13] preaching one time and
[1:38:15] he kind of got a little offline and
[1:38:18] when he got outside i just wouldn't hear
[1:38:20] i was somewhere else at that service and
[1:38:22] you know preaching with somebody else i
[1:38:24] guess and
[1:38:26] some of the people begin to say that
[1:38:27] ain't right
[1:38:31] well he hadn't desired to come back
[1:38:35] because it wasn't me telling them he was
[1:38:37] wrong
[1:38:39] it was you telling them they're wrong
[1:38:45] right
[1:38:47] like i said the other day a good way to
[1:38:49] stop a gossiper somebody comes to you
[1:38:51] and said i'll tell you something now but
[1:38:53] we need to pray
[1:38:56] well let's pray first
[1:38:58] and the person comes said we need to
[1:39:00] pray for this okay stop it right now get
[1:39:02] out on your knees three hours later what
[1:39:04] was you saying
[1:39:10] it ain't going to happen
[1:39:13] right
[1:39:15] so what do you do
[1:39:16] hey
[1:39:17] are you willing to go to brother collie
[1:39:19] and face that that you said about him
[1:39:24] well now i i don't wanna i don't know to
[1:39:26] shut up
[1:39:29] because you're scared
[1:39:31] you don't have the truth
[1:39:34] i've had to come to some of you people
[1:39:35] here
[1:39:36] right
[1:39:38] and talk to you about things
[1:39:44] why because i found out the truth
[1:39:48] i'm not against you

[1:39:54] just let's we're all just we're all good
[1:39:56] brothers and sisters well that's
[1:39:58] wonderful that's what i've just got to
[1:40:00] explaining i don't have anything against
[1:40:01] the baptist the messages the
[1:40:03] presbyterian the branham ice
[1:40:09] the problem is in lula
[1:40:14] we say we are the original seed
[1:40:20] well
[1:40:22] you can mix up a lot of things
[1:40:24] but what is it
[1:40:26] uh k or which one is it which ones you
[1:40:28] want it won't mix
[1:40:30] mustard
[1:40:31] mustard won't make some nothing
[1:40:38] but of course you know that brother dale
[1:40:40] you're hateful
[1:40:42] well good i'm glad you found that out
[1:40:46] but did i tell you the truth
[1:40:52] come on like i say i'm the only one in
[1:40:54] the building that's supposed to be able
[1:40:55] to meddle in other people's business
[1:40:59] right
[1:41:01] and i'll i'll open up the can of beans
[1:41:06] how many of you find me meddling in
[1:41:08] other people's business
[1:41:12] how many of you do i come and talk to
[1:41:14] you about other people
[1:41:19] well i'd follow the example
[1:41:22] we're talking about we're the original
[1:41:24] seed
[1:41:29] the original seed is supposed to be back
[1:41:30] like it was in the original
[1:41:33] trying to get to an end
[1:41:37] it is the rising of the sun
[1:41:41] that's that divine revelation of the
[1:41:43] word made flesh
[1:41:46] it was flesh in that day by the sun the
[1:41:49] groom
[1:41:51] talk about jesus right
[1:41:52] it's flesh today by the bride
[1:41:56] and you know what he covers then
[1:41:59] he said whosoever sins you remit
[1:42:04] to them they are remitted
[1:42:06] and whosoever sins you retain
[1:42:10] to them they're retained
[1:42:12] he's not a catholic church has got a way
[1:42:14] where they want to do that
[1:42:16] but said if you want to do it that way
[1:42:17] we got water over here
[1:42:19] you know a good repentance and a good
[1:42:21] thing
[1:42:22] settles a lot of things
[1:42:25] but you see why he calls mary a carrier
[1:42:32] but you know i'm having to stop because
[1:42:35] but somebody has got to be the seed
[1:42:41] it's not a choice it's not a thing it
[1:42:44] means god said it
[1:42:46] and it's got to come to pass
[1:42:49] somebody is going to be
[1:42:52] back to the original seed
[1:42:56] we've got the opportunity
[1:42:58] to be able to
[1:43:00] believe it
[1:43:02] and work on making it manifest
[1:43:04] but what if he was in the church where
[1:43:05] he well now let's keep it simple now it
[1:43:08] was real simple now
[1:43:09] we can't venture out on these deep
[1:43:11] things
[1:43:12] because we we might get confused
[1:43:15] no honey you're already confused
[1:43:20] brother brown said one day he said i'm
[1:43:22] not trying to preach this as a doctrine
[1:43:26] i think it's on predestination
[1:43:28] he said i'm preaching it try to
[1:43:30] straighten out doctor
[1:43:35] what about it
[1:43:37] mary wasn't the seed
[1:43:40] why
[1:43:42] because she wasn't god
[1:43:48] will you go with that
[1:43:49] i don't mean you'd holler amen
[1:43:51] i just mean will you accept that little
[1:43:54] thought
[1:43:55] that the prophet is bringing
[1:43:57] that mary was not the seed
[1:44:00] she was a carrier of it
[1:44:03] now he never meant
[1:44:05] and never did he ever say
[1:44:07] that pentecost was false
[1:44:09] a sister street he said it was the move
[1:44:11] of god
[1:44:13] never did he say wesley was false he was
[1:44:15] a move of god
[1:44:18] luther he never said it was false he
[1:44:20] said the move of god
[1:44:26] you see somebody's got to bring forth
[1:44:30] the original seat
[1:44:34] we've had the prophet to introduce us to
[1:44:36] the word
[1:44:38] right
[1:44:40] but when are we going to
[1:44:41] believe that we are the word
[1:44:43] that's right
[1:44:46] well that's just hard to believe
[1:44:53] it's hard to believe the economy is like
[1:44:55] it is
[1:44:57] but we keep on going it's going to get
[1:44:59] bad
[1:45:00] we got that promise
[1:45:04] right
[1:45:08] but it should be a whole lot easier to
[1:45:09] believe that god's trying his best to
[1:45:11] make himself manifest
[1:45:13] in a group of people
[1:45:15] now here's my final thought somebody has
[1:45:18] got
[1:45:19] to make manifest
[1:45:22] the original seed
[1:45:28] now come on brother branham said i am
[1:45:32] not
[1:45:33] the son of man
[1:45:35] he said i am a son of man
[1:45:37] he said the prophets were a son of man
[1:45:40] but he said jesus christ was decent of
[1:45:42] me
[1:45:43] well now we'll get on down to it
[1:45:44] eventually we wrote around said the
[1:45:46] bride of jesus christ
[1:45:49] is the son of man
[1:45:53] well somebody's got to do that that's
[1:45:55] right why can't we believe we're part of
[1:45:57] it
[1:46:00] and until we do we're going to keep
[1:46:02] dying
[1:46:06] but somebody's going to say
[1:46:08] i and my father are one
[1:46:14] it won't be quotes
[1:46:16] running off at the mountain let's stand
[1:46:17] together
[1:46:19] it'll be because they have become what
[1:46:21] god has said they are
[1:46:28] but you see we look at it on the bases
[1:46:30] if i could see great things happening
[1:46:33] then i would believe it
[1:46:36] you'll never see it
[1:46:42] but see then i try my best to express
[1:46:44] something in words
[1:46:45] for us to understand
[1:46:48] and then people think well brother dale
[1:46:49] don't believe in signs and wonders
[1:46:52] there's nobody in this building believes
[1:46:54] in signs and wonders any more than this
[1:46:55] man that you're looking at
[1:47:01] i have had god to speak to me i have
[1:47:04] seen
[1:47:06] things that other people that don't even
[1:47:07] talk about the spirit of it
[1:47:12] but i'm also straight
[1:47:15] that some of the people around here to
[1:47:16] two different occasions has tried their
[1:47:18] best to make me a prophet in the
[1:47:20] five-fold ministry and i stood in this
[1:47:22] pulpit and rebuked it
[1:47:26] what do you think would do that to most
[1:47:27] preachers
[1:47:28] they think they think i'm a prophet i
[1:47:30] guess i must be a prophet
[1:47:33] i know i'm
[1:47:34] not i'm a member of the body of christ
[1:47:38] i don't know the office of a prophet i
[1:47:40] know what a prophet's office is
[1:47:43] i studied those offices to know
[1:47:47] the greatest office i could be in is
[1:47:49] to be a minister in the body of jesus
[1:47:52] christ
[1:47:54] to try to bring the word
[1:47:57] not to build it on any emotion or any
[1:47:59] sensation build it on the word
[1:48:02] signs will always follow the word
[1:48:09] right
[1:48:10] what do we got boys i think that's good
[1:48:12] thank god for these kids
[1:48:15] some of you might not understand but
