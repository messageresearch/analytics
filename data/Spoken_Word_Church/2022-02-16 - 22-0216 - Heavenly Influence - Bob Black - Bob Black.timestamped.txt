[7:30] [Music]
[7:41] amen
[7:42] is that your desire tonight
[7:44] good to be back in the house of the lord
[7:48] you think about those words that we just
[7:49] sung those are those are echo and what
[7:51] isaiah said and in uh chapter six that
[7:54] we'll read here in a second
[7:56] that he saw the lord sitting upon throne
[7:58] high and lifted up
[8:00] and you think think that's actually what
[8:02] i got isaiah killed
[8:04] when king manasseh heard uh that isaiah
[8:06] saw the lord sitting on his throne
[8:08] he said
[8:09] well i remember over there in exodus
[8:11] chapter 33 it says that no man can see
[8:13] god and live
[8:15] and he got confused about what the
[8:16] scripture said so he chased isaiah down
[8:18] and isaiah hidden a cedar tree
[8:20] and he cut him down and
[8:23] the bible says he over in hebrews 11
[8:25] that he was sown asunder many are sown
[8:27] asunder
[8:28] but think about that song when you sing
[8:30] it maybe next time somebody got killed
[8:32] for for for what this song is
[8:35] as uh represents
[8:38] so let's turn over in isaiah chapter 6
[8:40] and we'll read that story tonight and
[8:42] talk about a heavenly influence
[8:45] oh god we're so grateful to be able to
[8:46] gather around your word once more and
[8:48] gather together with the saints of like
[8:50] precious faith lord as we brought our
[8:51] little looks of fire together
[8:53] we pray lord that you'll just be with us
[8:55] tonight lord god and open up these words
[8:57] to us lord that you'll give us strength
[8:58] in this hour
[9:00] help us lord that you'll give us some
[9:01] encouragement in the middle of the week
[9:02] lord god that you'll just lift up our
[9:04] hearts we pray in the name of the lord
[9:06] jesus christ amen
[9:09] now the bible says in isaiah chapter six
[9:11] verse one in the year that king uzziah
[9:14] died i saw also the lord sitting up on a
[9:16] throne
[9:17] high and lifted
[9:20] up not working yet
[9:30] we'll we'll keep moving on
[9:33] high and lifted up and his train
[9:35] filled the temple
[9:37] above it stood the seraphims
[9:40] each one had six wings
[9:42] with twain he covered his face and with
[9:44] twain he covered his feet and with twain
[9:47] he did fly
[9:49] and one cried unto another and said holy
[9:52] holy holy
[9:54] is the lord of hosts the whole earth is
[9:56] full of his glory
[9:58] and the post of the door moved at the
[10:00] voice of him that cried and the house
[10:02] was filled with smoke
[10:04] then said i woe is me for i am undone
[10:08] because i am a man of unclean lips and i
[10:10] dwell in the midst of a people of
[10:12] unclean lips
[10:13] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[10:16] lord of hosts
[10:17] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[10:19] having a live coal in his hand which he
[10:21] had taken with the tongs from off the
[10:23] altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[10:25] said
[10:26] lo this hath touched thy lips and thine
[10:27] iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[10:29] purged
[10:31] also i heard the voice of the lord
[10:33] saying
[10:34] whom shall i sin then who will go for us
[10:37] then said i here am i send me
[10:39] you may be seated the lord is blessing
[10:41] to the reading of the word
[10:46] now so so tonight i just want to speak
[10:48] on a heavenly influence because you know
[10:50] in the earth there's a lot of influences
[10:52] there's a lot of things that you can
[10:53] look at and be influenced by
[10:56] but we really are interested in that
[10:58] heavenly influence in in christ jesus in
[11:01] his word
[11:03] now isaiah that this chapter is talking
[11:05] about isaiah got his eyes on this this
[11:07] man king king uzziah
[11:09] and the bible talks about how uzziah was
[11:11] just he was a little shepherd boy when
[11:13] he became king when he was 16 years old
[11:16] and and the lord he set his eyes on the
[11:18] lord and and and did everything that the
[11:20] the word required of him and he began to
[11:24] be to be to be prospered prosperous and
[11:26] and and uh
[11:28] brother branham said as long as he saw
[11:29] the lord god made him to prosper and he
[11:32] he in second chronicles it said he saw
[11:34] god in the days of zechariah who had
[11:36] understanding in the visions of god
[11:39] and and and he god calls him to prosper
[11:42] and in second chronicles chapter verse 8
[11:44] it says the ammonites gave gifts to
[11:46] uzziah and his name spread abroad even
[11:48] to the entering end of egypt for he
[11:50] strengthened himself exceedingly and
[11:52] moreover use i built towers in jerusalem
[11:54] at the corner gate and at the valley
[11:56] gate and at the turning of the wall and
[11:58] fortified them and he built towers in
[12:00] the desert and digged many wells where
[12:02] he had much cattle both in the low
[12:03] country and in the plains husbandman
[12:05] also and vine dressers in the mountains
[12:07] and carmel for he loved husbandry
[12:10] and it says in in verse 15 and he made
[12:13] in jerusalem engines invented by cunning
[12:15] men to be on the towers and upon the
[12:16] bulwarks
[12:18] so because i use i began to prosper the
[12:21] lord gave him wisdom and how to build
[12:22] things and and he began to build
[12:24] defenses for jerusalem and build all
[12:26] these different things and maybe if you
[12:28] put it in uh
[12:36] this is this is a i guess this is a
[12:39] prayer request
[12:40] sister sharon had a hard day she's as a
[12:42] uti and has been very tired today please
[12:45] say a special prayer for her at the end
[12:46] of this aid to this church service we'll
[12:48] just leave that there to to remember
[12:50] that
[12:50] help me not forget that too
[12:53] sometimes i get sidetracked but help me
[12:54] not not to um so the uh uzziah began to
[12:58] uh
[12:59] he began to the lord caused him to
[13:01] prosper
[13:02] and and uh you know you you think about
[13:04] that if you if you bring that over in
[13:06] today's
[13:07] in in in in today's day
[13:10] uh you know sometimes you can begin to
[13:12] get so you begin to prosper within
[13:15] yourself and you might have a nice car
[13:17] and might have a nice home and and and
[13:19] all those things but yet
[13:21] you you've got to you got to continue on
[13:24] uzi began to prosper and he got he got
[13:26] in a place where he began to look at
[13:27] himself and all of his own
[13:28] accomplishments and began to get away
[13:30] from god and began to get built up
[13:31] within himself to think that he was he
[13:33] was somebody he began to his name was
[13:36] all spread abroad and he had built all
[13:37] these towers and everything
[13:39] and and he began to forget what it
[13:41] really means to serve god and you know
[13:43] brother ram said if we take the
[13:44] testimony not let's meditate on this
[13:46] just for a little bit if we take the
[13:47] testimony of being christians
[13:49] i think that is one of the most solemn
[13:51] things
[13:52] that a man or a woman boy or girl could
[13:55] do would
[13:57] now why why is that a solemn thing to
[13:59] say i'm a christian to get to come to
[14:01] church and be associated with people
[14:02] that believe in in jesus christ
[14:05] to to take the name of jesus christ why
[14:07] is the solemn thing because people
[14:09] people are looking at you when you say
[14:11] that you're a christian
[14:13] now now that goes for for anybody now it
[14:16] goes for a little child that's going to
[14:17] school that that people are looking at
[14:19] you to see how you act because you know
[14:22] the devil wants to give people excuses
[14:24] he wants to give
[14:25] you know the devil gives
[14:27] one of your schoolmates or one of your
[14:28] friends an excuse to say well they acted
[14:31] that way and so now now now that you've
[14:33] gotten a good excuse if if you can find
[14:35] somebody that's living in sin or doing
[14:37] wrong
[14:39] now now you see what brother i'm saying
[14:40] if we take the testimony of being
[14:42] christians that's one of the most solemn
[14:44] things that a man or a woman boy or girl
[14:46] could do
[14:47] when he takes on the name of christ that
[14:49] he is going to be a representative of
[14:52] christ
[14:53] so when you're a christian you you are a
[14:55] represent you represent
[14:57] you you're a representative of the
[14:59] kingdom of god so whenever you go to
[15:00] church or go to work people are looking
[15:03] at you as as well that's that person
[15:05] represents everything that a christian
[15:07] stands for everything that jesus christ
[15:09] stood for
[15:10] and so brother brown said you should
[15:12] watch
[15:13] every move you make because somebody
[15:17] is watching you
[15:19] now now we're not talking about some
[15:21] kind of santa claus thing where santa
[15:23] claus is always watching you but we're
[15:24] tonight we're talking about every people
[15:26] are watching you your friends are
[15:28] watching you and what a great privilege
[15:30] it would be now think about this that
[15:31] what a great blessing it would be
[15:33] to know that somebody's watching you
[15:36] that to know that that you can be an
[15:38] influence to other people when
[15:39] somebody's down you can be an influence
[15:41] to them you can give them words of
[15:43] encouragement and say and lift them up
[15:45] lift up their heart if somebody's living
[15:47] and sin
[15:48] that you've got a way out and you can be
[15:50] an influence to them when you're when
[15:52] you're when you're when your kids are
[15:54] down you can be an influence to them
[15:55] when your kids are living and sin or
[15:57] doing something wrong then you can be an
[15:59] influence to them and give them words of
[16:01] encouragement and help them help along
[16:03] the road what what a great blessing that
[16:05] is
[16:06] and brother brown said and in this it
[16:07] reflects what god has done for you
[16:10] inside of you so he's done something for
[16:13] you on the inside and now you can
[16:14] reflect that on the outside i'm just
[16:16] talking tonight
[16:17] i'm just talking a little bit now now
[16:19] brother ram said so so we're so what
[16:20] we're talking about tonight is somebody
[16:23] somebody you have the privilege to be an
[16:25] influence just people that are watching
[16:27] you
[16:28] so what what does that mean now
[16:30] that means now when we come to church do
[16:32] we take do we take god seriously are we
[16:34] coming to church just to just uh you
[16:36] know come to uh kind of sit on the pew
[16:38] and keep it warm and everything or or
[16:40] are we coming really really to get
[16:42] serious with god you know when isaiah
[16:45] got in that in that when he when his
[16:47] eyes were opened up to the vision of
[16:48] what god really was and he saw that saw
[16:51] him lifted up on his throne and with all
[16:53] the seraphims all around him and he he
[16:55] began to get real serious about god he
[16:58] began to realize that his eyes hadn't
[16:59] been on the right thing
[17:01] because when you get in the presence of
[17:03] god when you get let's say when you get
[17:05] in the influence of somebody that
[17:07] believes god and knows what they're
[17:08] talking about it it changes your
[17:10] perspective
[17:12] so when we come to church do you do you
[17:14] want do you do you live a holy life
[17:16] are you are you reverent with god do you
[17:18] do you do you take it seriously enough
[17:20] that you're concerned when when you slip
[17:22] and fall a little bit
[17:24] do you do you do you uh do you listen to
[17:26] worldly music or does that bother you do
[17:28] you dress like the world do you or do
[17:30] you do you love the world do you love
[17:32] those things of the world have have you
[17:34] become so cold to christianity and to
[17:37] the things of god that where you you'd
[17:39] really rather rather be out there in the
[17:41] world
[17:42] maybe maybe tonight maybe we can examine
[17:44] ourselves and see see see what's down on
[17:47] the inside because you know a lot of the
[17:49] problems that manifest on the outside
[17:50] what they really are is a heart problem
[17:52] and if we can get our heart straightened
[17:54] up and our heart going in the right
[17:56] direction then it'll fix everything on
[17:57] the outside
[17:59] so many times we beat on the outside but
[18:01] it's the heart that's got to be changed
[18:04] maybe maybe tonight you know what
[18:05] brother brown was really getting at when
[18:07] he preached this sermon influenced that
[18:08] he preached so many times as can
[18:10] somebody tell you're a christian
[18:12] because somebody when they get in the
[18:13] car with you and and listen to the music
[18:15] that you're listening to and listening
[18:17] to your conversation can they can they
[18:19] tell you're a christian or do they do
[18:21] they kind of wonder and stumble and
[18:24] well
[18:24] they go to a church they go to a
[18:27] methodist church
[18:28] but yet something don't look quite right
[18:32] now now so so we we we gotta don't be
[18:35] influenced by the earthy now now the
[18:37] bible says in first john chapter two
[18:40] verse 15 to 17 it says love not the
[18:42] world
[18:44] neither the things that are in the world
[18:46] if any man love the world the love of
[18:48] the father is not in it now you think
[18:50] about that now if you love the world
[18:53] if you love all the things that all if
[18:55] you love all the movies and stuff a
[18:56] whole lot more than you love reading
[18:58] your bible that that's something
[19:00] something's a little bit skewed if you
[19:01] love
[19:03] if you'd really rather be out there
[19:05] partying with your friends and and
[19:07] drinking alcohol and doing things that
[19:09] you shouldn't be doing
[19:10] then something something is not right
[19:13] for all that is in the world the lust of
[19:15] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[19:16] the pride of life is not of the father
[19:18] but is of the world and the world
[19:21] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[19:22] that doeth the will of god abideth
[19:24] forever now that gets real serious
[19:26] because that means that the world and
[19:28] everything in is eventually going to
[19:29] peter out until it's no more it gets
[19:32] burnt up in the lake of fire the the
[19:34] world system all that the devil stands
[19:37] for is going to come to an end but
[19:38] there's only one thing that's eternal
[19:40] and that's jesus christ
[19:42] and so we can have no confidence in
[19:43] anything of this of this world system we
[19:45] can have no confidence even in ourselves
[19:48] we can have no confidence in our flesh
[19:50] which is what the bible says in
[19:52] philippians 3 3 for we are the
[19:54] circumcisions which worship the god in
[19:55] the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus
[19:58] and have no confidence
[20:00] in the flesh
[20:02] we have no confidence in the flesh
[20:04] now that's why that's why mothers and
[20:06] fathers when your kids are dating and
[20:07] things you watch out for i'm real
[20:09] careful because we don't have any
[20:11] confidence in the flesh sometimes
[20:12] sometimes our children will say well why
[20:15] why do you want to keep such a close eye
[20:16] on me why do you want to you don't you
[20:19] trust me no
[20:21] cause the bible says we have no
[20:23] confidence in the flesh
[20:25] we don't have con i barely have
[20:27] confidence in myself i don't have
[20:28] confidence in myself not to
[20:30] procrastinate sometimes at work i don't
[20:32] have confidence not to put things off
[20:34] when i when i know it's tax season i put
[20:36] it off i i put off doing my i put off
[20:39] thing and so i have no confidence in
[20:40] things the things that i should should
[20:42] do i don't do
[20:44] there's many things that i don't do so i
[20:46] don't have confidence but there's one
[20:47] that you can have confidence in
[20:49] you can have confidence in his word you
[20:51] can have confidence in jesus christ
[20:53] [Applause]
[20:57] now see see you we'll be
[20:59] you you can't have confidence in one
[21:01] another so what we'll do what we'll do
[21:03] sometimes is we we look
[21:05] we look to one another
[21:07] to try to find an excuse for the way
[21:10] that we act we we looked at
[21:12] what a strange thing that is
[21:14] how we'll look to one another when we
[21:16] can't have confidence in one another but
[21:17] we'll look to one another to try to find
[21:19] fault well you did it so i can do it too
[21:22] you did it and we'll use others as an
[21:24] excuse for sin but they you did it now
[21:27] now now see now
[21:30] this is where this is where a lot of
[21:32] kids kind of the kids the kids will do
[21:34] this a lot they'll look to their parents
[21:37] now think about this now
[21:39] let's meditate on this
[21:41] the kids will look to their parents
[21:43] their past their parents past sins i i
[21:46] want all of y'all children to realize
[21:48] that one day
[21:49] your parents were sinners
[21:52] if you go back far enough your parents
[21:54] were sinners and because listen you
[21:56] can't have confidence you can't have
[21:57] confidence in nothing but jesus christ
[21:59] so now if you go back far enough you're
[22:01] going to find something terrible that
[22:03] your mama and daddy did and it's going
[22:05] to be a lot worse than just stealing the
[22:06] cookie now a lot of times
[22:08] a lot of times we'll go back and the
[22:10] kids will go back and they'll say well
[22:12] now let's get let's get it right down to
[22:14] the nitty-gritty
[22:15] we'll go back and you'll say well well i
[22:18] my parents uh
[22:19] did something out of wedlock or
[22:21] something and so you'll try to use that
[22:22] as an excuse for yourself to go do that
[22:24] or you well well i my parents drank
[22:27] alcohol so now i'm gonna go drink
[22:29] alcohol too i've got an excuse to do
[22:31] that and you realize you realize what
[22:33] you're doing you realize what the devil
[22:35] is doing
[22:38] i i've told my children before i i want
[22:40] i want y'all to be better than i was
[22:43] and what the devil does the devil does
[22:46] is he puts a trapping in the way so that
[22:48] you are
[22:49] worse than your parents
[22:51] that's why the bible says that every
[22:53] generation gets worse and worse first
[22:55] there was flappers and they had their
[22:57] their kind of short dress and they did
[22:58] their weird little dance but then they
[23:00] got worse and worse and every generation
[23:02] gets worse and worse why do they get
[23:04] worse and worse
[23:05] because of that trap that the devil puts
[23:07] you in
[23:08] the devil will make you look at the sins
[23:10] of your mother and father and say well
[23:12] if they did it i can do i can do one
[23:15] better
[23:16] but you're not doing better you're doing
[23:18] worse
[23:19] now think of that why
[23:20] think of the trap that the devil will
[23:22] put you in to think that to make you
[23:24] think that you're doing good
[23:26] by doing worse
[23:30] listen if it
[23:32] you can it almost becomes like a cycle
[23:35] where every generation
[23:37] the grandfather has a problem with
[23:38] alcohol so the son has a problem with
[23:40] alcohol and then and then the grandson
[23:42] has a problem with alcohol and they see
[23:43] that their generation before them has a
[23:45] problem with alcohol so it just keeps
[23:47] moving on
[23:48] moving on and they think you think
[23:51] looking back at your family that you
[23:53] have a right to have to to vape
[23:56] or drink alcohol or be be promiscuous or
[23:59] whatever it is make your list that you
[24:01] have a right to do that but i i want
[24:03] tonight maybe to challenge you that it's
[24:05] time to step out from the cycle and
[24:08] break the cycle
[24:09] because god has given you a word he's
[24:11] given you the power he's given you power
[24:13] to become sons of god and what is that
[24:15] power he's given you his word and if
[24:17] you'll get in that word and realize what
[24:20] god has given to you can step out
[24:22] from that cycle
[24:24] and you don't have to be an alcoholic
[24:25] anymore
[24:26] you don't have to smoke cigarettes
[24:28] anymore you don't have to smoke
[24:29] marijuana to be happy and you sure don't
[24:32] have to be promiscuous to be happy god
[24:34] wants virtuous young men and women he
[24:37] wants somebody to be holy i i i want to
[24:40] come back the idea tonight that that you
[24:42] you know growing up you used to you used
[24:44] to think i know the devil will tell kids
[24:46] lies this lie that you got to
[24:49] have a horrible life to have a real good
[24:52] testimony
[24:53] well listen you don't have to you don't
[24:55] have to have some kind of testimony
[24:56] tonight where you don't woke up in some
[24:58] bar with your arms around the toilet
[25:00] soaked in vomit you don't have to not
[25:02] you don't have to have that kind of a
[25:04] testimony to share now that's great if
[25:06] you got that kind of testimony to say
[25:08] that the lord delivered me from alcohol
[25:10] or from drugs or whatever and that's
[25:12] wonderful but tonight you can have you
[25:14] you think about what a wonderful
[25:16] testimony that would be
[25:18] to say that
[25:19] i never i never kissed another girl
[25:21] until i was married to say that i never
[25:23] drank alcohol or smoked cigarettes now
[25:26] i'm not preaching tonight that we need
[25:28] to be goody two-shoes or something i'm
[25:30] not preaching that do you be a good
[25:31] person like the rich young ruler and
[25:33] then come up and he couldn't give his
[25:34] heart to the lord that's not what i'm
[25:36] talking about we're not talking about
[25:37] goody two-shoes but i'm talking about
[25:39] that there is god has given us the
[25:41] ability and he wants he wants you to be
[25:43] better than the previous generation he
[25:46] wants you to live a virtuous life
[25:49] he don't want you to get tossed out in
[25:50] the gutter so it's time to break cycles
[25:53] now now you look back in the bible and
[25:55] you remember all these examples you
[25:57] remember
[25:58] you remember in first kings where it was
[25:59] prophesied that there was going to be a
[26:00] little boy come on the scene josiah and
[26:03] the bible prophesied that josiah was
[26:05] going what was he going to do he was
[26:06] going to break the cycle of his father
[26:07] ammon and ammon came on ammon had he was
[26:10] an idol worshiper and and i done all
[26:13] those things but one of the when josiah
[26:15] was just a little boy he he came on the
[26:17] scene and first kings had prophesied
[26:19] about him and and 300 years later here
[26:21] comes josiah on the scene and he could
[26:22] look back in the bible and read about
[26:24] himself
[26:25] and you know i i wonder if maybe he
[26:27] realized
[26:28] i ain't going to be like my daddy
[26:31] i am not going to be an idol worshiper
[26:33] i'm going to be a i'm going to be a
[26:34] god-fearing man and he tore down all
[26:36] those idols and he he stepped out in
[26:39] faith believing what what he was
[26:41] supposed to do he he could read in the
[26:42] bible where he was supposed to tear down
[26:44] idols and you know tonight you can read
[26:47] in the bible or you're supposed to tear
[26:48] down idols
[26:49] you can read in the bible where you're
[26:51] supposed to break cycles and you can do
[26:53] just like josiah did and not do not do
[26:56] the sins of your mother and father and
[26:58] not do like they did now now tonight i
[27:00] want to challenge you tonight that you
[27:01] don't have to tonight
[27:03] you don't have to listen to the lie of
[27:05] the devil that tells you to go look back
[27:07] at the sins of your ancestors and that
[27:09] you got to do like they did
[27:11] you don't have to do those things
[27:14] you think about two if you're looking at
[27:16] your parents
[27:18] one day your kids will be looking at you
[27:21] so if you're looking at your parents now
[27:23] to see a justification for what you
[27:25] should do think about what your kids are
[27:28] going to be looking at you
[27:30] do you want one day
[27:32] one day your kids will be doing the
[27:34] exact same thing that you're doing
[27:36] one day your kids will be asking the
[27:37] same kind of questions mama and daddy
[27:40] did you ever
[27:41] have your kids ever asked you that they
[27:43] start going down that list did you ever
[27:45] and your eyes get wide
[27:48] did you ever do this did you ever do
[27:50] that now think about that young people
[27:52] one day your kids are going to be asking
[27:54] those questions
[27:56] how how do you think you're going to
[27:58] feel when those questions come up
[28:00] did you do this did you do that
[28:07] oh
[28:09] the second corinthians i said says such
[28:11] trust have we through christ to god's
[28:13] word
[28:15] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[28:16] to think anything is of ourselves
[28:19] we're not sufficient in ourselves at all
[28:21] but our sufficiency is of god
[28:24] you see my confidence tonight my
[28:26] confidence might not be it's not in
[28:28] being a good person like the rich young
[28:30] ruler not just being good but my
[28:32] confidence sitting in being a minister
[28:34] my confidence sitting and having a bible
[28:36] in my home
[28:37] or or the role that i have in church and
[28:40] being a deacon or sunday school teacher
[28:41] and all those things those those are
[28:43] good things and everything but my
[28:45] confidence is in jesus christ
[28:47] you can take away all those things but
[28:50] see you can't put you can't put
[28:51] confidence in anything outside of jesus
[28:53] christ so don't look at other people
[28:56] don't look at other circumstances don't
[28:57] look at you where you're at don't even
[28:59] look at what role you have in the church
[29:01] there's been plenty of people that have
[29:03] had high roles and pastures and all
[29:05] kinds of things around the message
[29:06] around christian life and and it didn't
[29:08] amount to nothing in the end but so you
[29:11] can't have confidence in nothing but
[29:12] jesus christ
[29:15] won't you once you give your life to him
[29:17] once you give your life if if not
[29:19] tonight maybe beside your bed at night
[29:21] when you go home and you begin to cry
[29:23] and call out to god and realize that god
[29:25] loves you that he gave you these
[29:27] promises because he wants to save you
[29:29] and he wants you to pull out pull you
[29:31] out of the pit
[29:32] so that your life does not become ruined
[29:38] if you look the crowd what does that
[29:40] mean look to christ
[29:41] what does that mean look to the word we
[29:43] say that a lot but what does that really
[29:44] mean that means that means if you want
[29:46] to find out what success really is
[29:49] then go look in the bible
[29:51] go look in the bible and find out what
[29:52] success was success might look like it
[29:56] might look like maybe maybe lazarus that
[29:58] the the story that brother that jesus
[30:00] told about lazarus dying and and he went
[30:02] to heaven and the and the rich man went
[30:04] to hell
[30:06] but yet that was a man that was that was
[30:08] that was begging for bread that was poor
[30:10] but that was success
[30:12] so if you want to find out success go
[30:14] look in the bible success is a man at
[30:15] the end of the road after his life has
[30:17] been wound out then he's he's he's
[30:20] resting in the bosom of abraham resting
[30:22] in the bosom of christ
[30:24] success success the word will tell you
[30:26] how to live
[30:28] it'll tell you how to live in a way
[30:29] where you're not you're not when bad
[30:31] times come yet you still got joy in your
[30:33] heart because you know that you you can
[30:35] have confidence in christ
[30:37] he's going to see you through he's going
[30:38] to he's still jehovah gyra he's still
[30:41] out i when i need something i can
[30:43] turn to the breasted one he's still he's
[30:45] still the one from where i get all my
[30:47] strength
[30:48] the look to the word because the word
[30:50] will tell you how to work it'll tell you
[30:52] how to work like solomon said like an
[30:54] ant go look at the ant and and you'll
[30:56] find out how to how to work and how to
[30:57] do how to live how to treat your wife
[31:00] how to not not to beat her over the head
[31:02] with a shovel or something or grab her
[31:03] by the hair and holler off to your cave
[31:05] or something but how to how to treat her
[31:07] in love and
[31:08] and and you young men and young women
[31:10] tonight you know that when you get
[31:12] married you you want somebody that's not
[31:14] just in it so that they can check off
[31:15] that list that now i'm married but
[31:17] somebody that'll really love you
[31:19] and that's what the bible that's what
[31:21] the word will tell you how to do how to
[31:23] love somebody what to look for
[31:26] how to treat others
[31:28] it'll tell you how to treat others do
[31:30] unto others as you would have them do
[31:31] unto you that's how a christian lives a
[31:34] christian is not selfish but a christian
[31:36] a christian looks and sees somebody with
[31:38] a flat tire on the side of the road and
[31:39] they know that if they were in that
[31:40] predicament they need some help so they
[31:42] pull over and help them out a christian
[31:44] sees somebody that's poor and destitute
[31:46] in the church and they need some money
[31:47] for food and so they give them food
[31:49] because they know that if they were in
[31:50] that predicament they'd need some help a
[31:52] christian will give uplifting words to
[31:54] somebody because they know that if they
[31:56] were in that predicament they'd want
[31:58] somebody to come along and give them a
[31:59] little encouragement and stuff do under
[32:01] others that you would have them do unto
[32:03] you
[32:07] and that's how you be an influence
[32:09] that's what what's brother i'm talking
[32:10] about he's talking about that you can be
[32:13] it isn't it strange in this sermon if
[32:15] you go back and listen to it what a
[32:17] strange thing that he says to not be
[32:18] influenced by others by the failings of
[32:20] other people
[32:22] to in other words don't get so caught up
[32:24] in looking at other people
[32:26] but you want people to look at you
[32:28] in that strange that almost seems like a
[32:31] paradox
[32:32] that you can have people look at you and
[32:34] be influenced to the kingdom of heaven
[32:37] but yet don't get all caught up in the
[32:39] failings of other people because there's
[32:40] going to be a lot of failings there's
[32:41] going to be a lot of things to look at
[32:43] don't get all hung up on it but yet let
[32:46] people get hung up on you let people let
[32:49] people look at you and say i i won't i
[32:51] want to love god i want i want to be
[32:53] like that
[32:55] if you're really an influence to others
[32:57] then when somebody looks at your life
[32:59] they want to be more of a christian
[33:01] that's what i want to be i know many
[33:03] times i fail i fail my family i fail my
[33:06] i feel my wife in many many ways but yet
[33:09] when i look in the word i i know that
[33:11] this is the pattern that we've got to
[33:12] pattern our lives out of that we've got
[33:14] we've got to be an influence to others
[33:16] this is what the world needs the world
[33:19] needs somebody that they look at and say
[33:21] and they're drawn to christ because the
[33:23] world is hungry and thirsty
[33:26] everywhere you go you see thirsty people
[33:28] that they need something and what they
[33:30] need is christ and where else are they
[33:32] going to find it but you
[33:36] now brother brown said in the message
[33:38] life he said a brother was testifying to
[33:40] me this morning
[33:41] he was called to the ministry when a
[33:43] little boy
[33:45] and then he fell he said
[33:48] and he said but then he came back with
[33:49] more of a call to preach than ever
[33:51] before and brother around you said you
[33:53] see what it was
[33:55] when he became a christian
[33:57] he got in the wrong environment
[34:01] and that environment influenced him see
[34:03] and you just keep holding around with
[34:05] that kind of environment
[34:07] it influences you
[34:08] i hope you're reading between the lines
[34:10] what i'm saying see
[34:12] it influences you in that environment
[34:15] what's he saying
[34:16] what you your friends that you hang
[34:18] around with they're going to influence
[34:20] you
[34:20] the people that you hate the the place
[34:22] that you hang around with influences
[34:25] that that's why we come to church
[34:26] because so that we can get under the
[34:28] influence of the gospel
[34:30] now he said in the first thing you know
[34:32] you become a part of that environment
[34:36] that's what we do when we come to church
[34:37] we're trying to become a part of the
[34:39] word
[34:40] now whatever environment you're hanging
[34:42] around with that's what you're going to
[34:43] become a part of
[34:45] he said you go into it and just like a
[34:48] good clean man that's clean and moral
[34:50] and he begins to associate with a bunch
[34:51] of people who's not
[34:53] see you take up the spirit of that
[34:55] now now you think about that that that
[34:57] should really influence who we hang
[34:59] around with and what we you when you go
[35:02] when you look at your friends and look
[35:04] at people in the church and you think
[35:05] well that's the kind of person that i
[35:07] want to be like then you go hang around
[35:09] them more and you look at people and
[35:11] they're they're really um the young
[35:13] people call it toxic you know they're
[35:14] always pulling you down and everything
[35:16] you you think
[35:18] you you you'll think well i don't want
[35:19] to be like that and so you maybe you'll
[35:21] distance yourself a little bit from it
[35:23] what what are you doing you're you're
[35:25] you want to get around people that
[35:27] believe you want to
[35:29] i was listening to a sermon where
[35:30] brother i was he was he he told this
[35:32] little girl that she was healed and
[35:34] and uh if you go follow it through this
[35:37] the story is
[35:39] she she went home and she got around the
[35:41] people in her home and they began to
[35:43] tell her things about doubt i don't
[35:44] believe that you're healed i don't
[35:46] believe that there's anything wrong with
[35:47] you and i don't believe that that was a
[35:48] real call man of god and she got in that
[35:51] influence that negative influence as she
[35:53] began to lose her healing and she went
[35:55] back to the prayer line and brother
[35:57] brown explained to her what happened
[35:59] you see how important it is to get in
[36:00] the right environment because your
[36:02] environment is what influences you so
[36:05] what you want to get around people
[36:07] people that tell you the truth
[36:09] people that tell you and that what the
[36:11] gospel is is telling you the truth
[36:13] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[36:15] and the intents of the heart and because
[36:16] it's the truth and sometimes it's
[36:19] scalding a little bit but listen even
[36:21] when you're you know you want to you
[36:23] want to listen
[36:24] you
[36:26] many times your parents will tell you
[36:27] the truth
[36:28] and you get upset with it but that's
[36:30] what you want because you want the truth
[36:32] is what will open up what the truth is
[36:35] what will help you
[36:38] the truth so you get in that environment
[36:42] now brother roman said in the message
[36:43] influence he said now you know there is
[36:45] somebody that you're influencing
[36:47] your life is a written epistle read of
[36:49] all men
[36:50] therefore if your life isn't according
[36:52] to your testimony or your testimony
[36:54] according to your life
[36:56] you are putting a stumbling block in
[36:58] somebody's way
[36:59] for somebody is watching you
[37:02] some little child
[37:03] is watching his mother
[37:05] watching his dad
[37:07] i think there's something real deep in
[37:09] here
[37:10] because if you if you realize that your
[37:12] kids are watching you
[37:14] if you realize
[37:15] then you can begin to change the
[37:17] atmosphere in your home
[37:19] because whatever you do whatever the way
[37:21] that you act that's the way they're
[37:23] going to want to act
[37:24] whatever things that however you act now
[37:26] brother brown began to go on and explain
[37:28] he said now you go out in this in this
[37:30] in the yard and you look up at the stars
[37:32] and the sun is sitting up there in this
[37:34] position it's got an influence it's got
[37:36] an influence
[37:38] over the whole solar system
[37:40] now what does the sun have to do
[37:42] it doesn't have to do nothing but just
[37:43] sit there
[37:45] it's just sit there in this place
[37:47] isn't that what god's trying to bring us
[37:49] to up to a place where he can position a
[37:51] place us where we know what we're
[37:52] supposed to do what we know like brother
[37:54] wade was preaching on sunday whether
[37:56] we're a preacher or or a a bus driver or
[38:00] whatever or or just a a homemaker or
[38:03] somebody in our a a a godly husband
[38:06] that's running his house that's driving
[38:08] his home bus at what whatever your
[38:10] position is
[38:12] you look at all these all the things
[38:13] that in the sky that the moon that could
[38:15] actually pull and push the tide and move
[38:18] it and it doesn't have to do nothing but
[38:21] just set in its place
[38:23] the sun is it it's got all these all
[38:25] these types it's a yellow light it to
[38:27] bring photosynthesis this is steady it's
[38:29] not pulsating that god put it in his
[38:31] place so that he could give light and
[38:33] warmth and bring life to the earth and
[38:35] all it has to do is set in its place
[38:38] now when you find your place
[38:40] you don't have to work something up you
[38:41] don't have to run you don't you don't
[38:43] even have to lecture your kids
[38:45] if you find your place
[38:47] what does that mean now find your place
[38:49] you remember that story brother i'm told
[38:50] about the the little the
[38:52] little sister that had the drunk husband
[38:54] and he came home with all his friends
[38:55] and they were laughing but but she was
[38:57] now she was in her place and she didn't
[38:59] have to go lecture him and beat him
[39:01] about the head with a broomstick to try
[39:03] to get him to understand what she was
[39:04] about all she did was mop that floor and
[39:07] sing must jesus bear the cross alone and
[39:10] because she was in her place she was
[39:12] just in her place she was doing what a
[39:14] christian does a christian does what a
[39:16] christian does a sinner does what a
[39:18] sinner does but when the life of christ
[39:20] is in you you're going to do what a
[39:21] christian does and you don't have to do
[39:23] nothing but just be a christian and that
[39:25] that little that little man was
[39:27] converted there because he was looking
[39:29] at his wife
[39:30] in her place
[39:32] now you think about the atmosphere that
[39:34] you can create in your home just by
[39:35] being in your place
[39:37] maybe your kids will come home at night
[39:39] and
[39:40] from from from working late at whatever
[39:42] they're doing and doing things that they
[39:44] shouldn't be doing but when they step
[39:45] into your home
[39:47] they hear that tape playing
[39:49] they hear gospel music playing maybe
[39:51] they maybe they walk down the hall
[39:53] and they hear mama praying in the back
[39:55] bedroom
[39:59] you see you see you don't have to do
[40:00] nothing but be a christian i've i've
[40:03] heard
[40:04] somebody i know was given a testimony
[40:06] about how they were growing up and
[40:08] and the dad would would maybe he'd be
[40:10] over there watching tv but they look
[40:11] over in the corner and mama was sitting
[40:14] there with a with a message book in her
[40:15] lap and she had it open she wasn't doing
[40:18] nothing but being a christian but the
[40:19] kids remember that because they look
[40:21] back years later and they remember they
[40:23] remember when the door was closed and
[40:25] they could hear mama in the next room
[40:26] praying and and maybe they didn't go up
[40:28] to mama right then and say mama mama
[40:31] it's you're being a real big influence
[40:33] to me but years later they look back and
[40:35] they remember mama being an influence
[40:38] why because she was in her place and she
[40:40] didn't have to do nothing just like the
[40:42] sun and the moon and the stars and and
[40:44] the earth and everything that you can
[40:46] look up into the sky and see is a
[40:48] testimony of if you'll get in your place
[40:50] if you'll just be a christian
[40:52] then you'll be an influence
[40:54] now you think about that the influence
[40:56] that you can have in your home if you
[40:58] can if you just if you just
[41:00] if you'll just do these things this just
[41:02] think about how simple this is sometimes
[41:04] we won't we want something complex we
[41:06] want somebody to give us give us
[41:08] something that some something something
[41:10] magic or something to change things but
[41:12] listen think about the simplicity of of
[41:15] a home
[41:16] where where you're they're not playing
[41:18] uh
[41:19] sports all the time and playing all
[41:20] kinds of stuff on the tv when you walk
[41:22] in but the simplicity of a gospel home
[41:26] that's an influence to the children
[41:29] the simplicity that that is what will
[41:31] change lives when that when the children
[41:33] late at night i i remember growing up in
[41:35] my home i'll bring it personal
[41:38] growing up in my home and i'd be laying
[41:39] asleep in bed before a big test or
[41:42] something i could hear my dad down the
[41:44] hall praying at night because and that
[41:47] was an influence to me how was it an
[41:49] influence because i began to recognize
[41:51] as his the way that he prayed through
[41:53] the night would change
[41:55] that there was a real god that this
[41:58] wasn't just some kind of made up thing
[42:00] that like brother branham would say
[42:01] we're not talking about scholastics you
[42:04] ever you ever get to the place maybe
[42:05] where you think that the message is just
[42:07] scholastics and learning there's just a
[42:10] lot of education but there is a real
[42:12] spirit of a living god that can move
[42:14] into your home and and if you'll if
[42:16] you'll just approach it in faith god
[42:19] will come in your home and he'll bring
[42:22] peace and he'll bring joy and he'll
[42:24] change
[42:25] the atmosphere then it becomes not just
[42:28] a letter on the page but it becomes a
[42:30] living reality that's the kind of gospel
[42:32] that i'm preaching tonight i believe i
[42:34] believe that this is more than just
[42:36] learning that there's a real god that
[42:38] can come you know you can take advantage
[42:40] of that
[42:42] when you begin to pray for your kids and
[42:44] and you see them going off and doing
[42:45] stuff that they shouldn't a lot of times
[42:47] there's nothing that you can really say
[42:49] to them with your mouth but you get down
[42:51] on your knees and you say god i know
[42:53] that that spirit that you that you're
[42:54] real and you go after them and you watch
[42:57] you watch they'll get to a place maybe
[42:59] where they're sitting on the side of the
[43:00] road somewhere or sitting in a parking
[43:02] lot and they begin to think that this is
[43:05] why it's the spirit of god dealing with
[43:07] them and he'll come down and begin to
[43:08] move on the scene and begin to kind of
[43:11] crush at their heart and twist at it and
[43:13] pull at their heartstrings and begin to
[43:15] do something that you can't do with your
[43:17] own words
[43:19] sometimes
[43:20] sometimes our words are the things that
[43:21] gets us all all messed up your words set
[43:25] in anger will make them make them run
[43:27] away from you but but the spirit of god
[43:29] woo and over their heart will do what he
[43:31] did to the earth seven thousand years
[43:33] ago when the seas began to come up let
[43:35] the spirit of god begin to woo over your
[43:37] children and watch something begin to
[43:39] change
[43:41] amen
[43:42] and what makes it happen your faith
[43:45] your faith when you pray in faith
[43:46] praying faith believing
[43:48] believing that what he did for you he's
[43:50] able to do for your family
[43:54] and brotherhood said now here we find
[43:56] where that a christian testimony
[43:58] no matter how great it's been in the
[44:00] past
[44:01] it must always continue that way
[44:07] now uzziah got to a place where he
[44:10] thought he was a big shot he thought
[44:12] that because
[44:13] put it today he thought because of the
[44:15] he had that that hair style or whatever
[44:17] he thought he had a nice suit he thought
[44:19] he could he could roll up in the church
[44:21] parking lot in a corvette or a big old
[44:23] nice truck or a big something that he
[44:25] was somebody and he didn't have to
[44:27] listen to the ministers anymore that he
[44:28] could just do his own thing
[44:30] because he had been blessed maybe he had
[44:32] a lot of money in the bank account maybe
[44:34] he got to a place where he he was like i
[44:36] don't need nothing from nobody i'm i'm a
[44:38] big shot i'm going to tell y'all how to
[44:40] do it
[44:41] and brother brown said he'd try to take
[44:42] somebody else's place
[44:45] what what did he do he he
[44:46] he got to a place where he just ignored
[44:48] what the ministers are saying all those
[44:50] priests out there telling them you can't
[44:51] go into that golden altar and alter
[44:54] incense it's not lawful for you to do
[44:56] now you can apply that to any scenario
[44:58] in your life
[44:59] you apply that to telling your kids
[45:01] you're not supposed to do this or that
[45:02] or whatever you're supposed to
[45:05] telling your kids you're supposed to
[45:06] dress in a way that sinful men won't
[45:09] look at you
[45:13] oh you could go down the line all kinds
[45:15] of things
[45:17] but you see the the the the end result
[45:20] of uzziah turning refusing to be
[45:22] corrected was a leprosy appeared on his
[45:24] face
[45:25] he reaped what he sowed you know what
[45:28] any any decision you make there's
[45:30] consequences i was talking to a minister
[45:33] friend of mine that he he likens it to
[45:34] there's a shark after you
[45:36] all through your life if you if you
[45:37] don't pay your taxes the shark is going
[45:39] to get you if you don't if you don't uh
[45:41] you know there's so many different
[45:43] things that the sharks will get you if
[45:45] you don't do it because there's the
[45:46] shark has consequences
[45:48] if if you don't if you don't pray before
[45:50] you get married before you find somebody
[45:52] to get married there's there might be
[45:54] consequences you might reap what you sow
[45:57] there's gonna be consequences a lot of
[45:59] times consequences are really bad if you
[46:00] go out there and be promiscuous then the
[46:02] consequences are going to be a little
[46:04] baby in your arms
[46:06] there's consequences to your decisions
[46:10] and you see uzi he got to a place where
[46:12] he didn't have humility
[46:14] when he was strong
[46:16] when he was strong in himself he did not
[46:18] have humility
[46:19] when his kingdom was all built up he
[46:21] didn't have reverence
[46:23] he didn't put his faith into action
[46:27] and brother i'm saying now we find out
[46:29] that it is trying to take the minister's
[46:30] place
[46:31] and someone telling him he is out of
[46:33] place telling him he shouldn't do that
[46:36] he's out of place he became angered
[46:39] angered he was so angered till his face
[46:41] turned red
[46:43] hank why would you be angry if somebody
[46:44] tells you the truth
[46:46] why why would he be angered if somebody
[46:48] tell him you don't have to do go through
[46:50] all the effort and everything of of it's
[46:52] like he's like
[46:54] you know sisters i think should be real
[46:56] appreciative that they don't have to
[46:57] preach
[46:58] but yet so many want to get on facebook
[47:00] and be a preacher on facebook and things
[47:03] there's so many things you know you
[47:05] shouldn't rile up about when when
[47:06] somebody tells you that's not your place
[47:09] what what is the gospel trying to do
[47:11] it's trying to get put us in our place
[47:13] put it if you're a song leader be a song
[47:15] leader if you're a preacher be a
[47:16] preacher if you're a deacon be a deacon
[47:18] if you're whatever you are if you're a
[47:20] homemaker be a homemaker and if you're
[47:22] in your place
[47:23] then you get you get to a place where
[47:26] you just don't have to do nothing it
[47:27] just automatically works and because he
[47:30] didn't want to get in his place god
[47:32] smote him with leprosy
[47:33] he said that brother said the man died
[47:35] in his leprosy which is a type of sin
[47:38] and the influence in the message
[47:40] influence he said now you say well what
[47:41] do you mean
[47:43] leprosy represents sin and when a man
[47:45] won't stand correction by the word of
[47:48] god
[47:48] he's full of leprosy
[47:51] blows up and carries on
[47:54] what does you what do you do you ruin
[47:57] what are you ruining you ruin your
[47:58] influence
[47:59] what do you ruin you because when
[48:01] somebody sees that you won't stand
[48:02] correction it just ruins everything
[48:05] he said people knows and can tell the
[48:07] word that you're corrected by that
[48:08] you're not going to do it
[48:11] therefore you ruin your influence
[48:15] well don't we want influence
[48:17] you want to you want to be able to
[48:18] influence the people that you associate
[48:20] with and i think i think that's going to
[48:22] be
[48:23] maybe just really nail this down to the
[48:25] young people
[48:26] you want to be a leader
[48:28] when others look at you you want to be
[48:30] the one that they that they want to be
[48:32] like
[48:33] that you don't don't want to be like the
[48:34] sinner don't want to be like the world
[48:36] but let them want to be like you
[48:39] let them want to be like you
[48:41] uzziah when he got to the spot where he
[48:43] thought he was secure then he got lifted
[48:45] up in his heart he got to a place that
[48:46] no one could tell him anything my that's
[48:50] a horrible place when you get to a place
[48:52] where
[48:53] lord don't let any of us ever get to
[48:55] that place no matter how much revelation
[48:57] we've got no matter how much word we've
[48:58] got don't ever get to a place where
[49:00] nobody can tell you nothing because when
[49:02] you get to a place where you're above
[49:04] the dust and you are above god is what
[49:06] brother amber said when you were when
[49:08] you get to a place where look at me now
[49:11] look at me now nobody can tell me
[49:13] nothing
[49:15] then you're
[49:16] then you're in a spot set for
[49:18] destruction
[49:19] brother ram said how many great men
[49:21] great servants of who god has used
[49:22] finally come to a place till they feel
[49:24] that they know so much about the word of
[49:26] god till they don't even have time that
[49:28] time off to pray no more it's always
[49:31] social visits visit somebody go out to
[49:33] dinner and
[49:35] they get so high up until they all they
[49:37] want to do is socialize they you see
[49:39] we've got to spend time with god
[49:42] god is where we get our our influence
[49:45] from he's where we get our strengths
[49:47] from and if all we want is just to be
[49:49] around uh to look at one another and
[49:51] things like that he said the time that
[49:53] they should be spending with god alone
[49:55] and preparing to come out and the
[49:56] sweetness of the spirit before the
[49:58] congregation
[49:59] they're out somewhere with some
[50:01] entertainments you can't serve god and
[50:04] man at the same time
[50:05] god's servant should be an isolated
[50:08] person to him only
[50:11] my
[50:12] you think think about that for us
[50:14] ministers
[50:15] that that really you know brother talked
[50:17] about in the stature of a perfect man
[50:18] that he said they were men a few words
[50:20] they just got behind the pulpit and then
[50:21] they spoke and and how they they weren't
[50:23] spending all their time going around uh
[50:25] you know maybe like kissing babies and
[50:27] making every making everybody happy
[50:29] what they were trying to do was make god
[50:31] happy you think about isaiah that he
[50:33] because of the stand he took he got
[50:35] killed he got they healed him down in
[50:37] that tree and and sliced him up because
[50:40] of the stand he took not because he was
[50:42] trying to make people happy because he
[50:44] was he wanted to be an influence of the
[50:46] right thing
[50:48] make sure that you're influenced by the
[50:49] right thing the king got lifted up
[50:52] in pride and he thought he was so secure
[50:54] until god would let him get by with
[50:55] anything
[50:57] until he thought he had a right
[50:59] we don't have any right a christian a
[51:01] christian don't have any rights you
[51:02] don't have a you don't have a right to
[51:04] live loose you don't have a right to
[51:06] smoke you don't have a right to drink
[51:09] you don't have a right to look like the
[51:10] world
[51:11] you don't have a right to live like the
[51:13] world
[51:14] you don't have a right your christian
[51:15] absolves all our rights and the law
[51:17] brother said the law don't say i can't
[51:19] do it he said i know that it don't
[51:20] people will say that the law don't say i
[51:22] can't do it he said i don't hardly say
[51:24] anything you can do anything you want to
[51:26] that's right just about anything but
[51:28] brother it's not in a christian's heart
[51:30] to do that
[51:31] if you'll purpose in your heart that
[51:33] you'll live clean and pure before god
[51:36] nature itself will teach you that those
[51:39] things are wrong
[51:42] you realize that's what the new birth
[51:44] does
[51:45] the new birth will change your heart
[51:48] not not beating one another
[51:50] not hammering on your kids
[51:53] a lot of times we want to change our
[51:54] kids make our kids think right by
[51:56] telling them telling them stories and
[51:58] things
[51:59] but we got to have the new birth
[52:01] the young people need the new birth
[52:03] that's what it you'll be you'll be in a
[52:06] load of grief until you get your kids
[52:08] born again
[52:09] it's it's it's a hard road i'll be
[52:11] honest it's hard road until you get your
[52:13] kids born i remember riding in the car
[52:15] with my kids and it'd be an argument you
[52:17] why don't you do this why don't you
[52:19] i i don't understand why we have to do
[52:21] this i don't understand why we have to
[52:22] do that but but when they got born again
[52:25] it changed everything and it'll be like
[52:28] that until they get born again so so
[52:30] don't worry about telling them all kinds
[52:32] of philosophies and psychologies and
[52:35] going to the bookstore and trying to
[52:36] find a good self-help book that you can
[52:38] share with them what they need to do is
[52:40] like nicodemus jesus told nicodemus you
[52:42] must be born again
[52:44] that's that's your number one mandate
[52:46] for your kids is getting born again and
[52:48] and you know as christian parents
[52:50] you've got you've got you're set up to
[52:52] be an influence to them because your
[52:54] kids can't leave
[52:56] your kids are stuck in your house
[52:58] they can't leave and so you you can be
[53:01] an influence
[53:02] every morning when they're waking up
[53:04] that you can they can look over and see
[53:06] you reading your bible or hear you at
[53:07] night praying and and listen to the tape
[53:10] playing constantly because they're in
[53:11] your house and you can be an influence
[53:13] to the day that they got enough money to
[53:15] leave or whatever they're going to do
[53:17] but take advantage of it that you you
[53:19] can be an influence to your children
[53:23] to change their heart
[53:24] it's heart a heart
[53:27] that's that's the reason why a lot of
[53:29] times kids they want to marry somebody
[53:30] that you're like what why would you why
[53:33] would you do that because their heart
[53:35] ain't right it's not that they need a
[53:37] long lecture it's not that they need a
[53:39] lot of information they need their heart
[53:41] to be changed if we can get that fixated
[53:42] in our mind it might change our approach
[53:45] their heart needs to be changed
[53:47] you can you can parade all the youtube
[53:49] videos and all the lectures and all the
[53:50] different things in front of them make
[53:52] them sit there for four or five hours
[53:53] and listen to all your so-called words
[53:56] of wisdom but they need to be born again
[53:59] they need to be born again
[54:00] all the psychology in the world all the
[54:02] dr dobson in the world ain't gonna
[54:04] change them if they ain't born again
[54:05] they need to be born again it's not
[54:07] gonna help if they're not born again and
[54:10] brother ram said we need influential
[54:12] christians influenced by the word of god
[54:14] call men or women for an influence to
[54:17] the elected chur church for the last
[54:19] days
[54:20] is what we need that's what we need we
[54:22] need some some real christians that will
[54:24] stand for the truth
[54:25] now isaiah in isaiah chapter 6 verse 1
[54:29] it says in the year that king uzziah
[54:31] died
[54:32] i saw also the lord sitting upon the
[54:34] throne high and lifted up and his train
[54:36] filled the temple
[54:38] when isaiah got in that atmosphere of
[54:41] that heavenly influence it's changed his
[54:44] whole perspective
[54:45] it changed the way he was looking at
[54:47] things
[54:48] and brother abraham said it drove isaiah
[54:50] to his knees
[54:52] now you know you can set that kind of
[54:54] atmosphere that
[54:56] isaiah isaiah saw that he he got lifted
[55:00] up to the to where he saw that a vision
[55:03] but you know you can change that
[55:05] atmosphere in your home with the music
[55:08] and the things in your home so that so
[55:10] that your kids can be drawn into that
[55:12] same situation that isaiah was drawn in
[55:15] that's what brother brown was trying to
[55:17] explain in this
[55:19] the king was sitting on the throne where
[55:21] is he sitting at now he's sitting on the
[55:23] throne of your heart the first throne
[55:25] was christ there's a throne in heaven
[55:27] the throne of christ when he came to the
[55:28] earth but now he's on your throne and
[55:31] isaiah got caught up into that place
[55:33] where he saw the lord sitting on the
[55:34] throne and he saw his train and it and
[55:36] it filled the temple you know what a
[55:37] train is
[55:39] in the old days they would they would uh
[55:40] when when a king conquered an enemy he
[55:43] would he would keep adding to that
[55:44] throne i was reading this thing on the
[55:46] internet that said the king's train
[55:49] was actually made up of pieces or
[55:51] swatches
[55:52] of the royal robes of defeated kings
[55:55] the conquering king would have portions
[55:57] of the defeated king's robes cut and
[55:59] sown into his own robe as a symbol and
[56:02] testimony of the conqueror's strength
[56:04] and power
[56:06] now you think now he got caught up into
[56:08] a vision of the mighty conqueror the one
[56:10] that could conquer
[56:12] every problem in his life i'm talking
[56:14] about i'm talking about you know
[56:16] whatever it be alcohol or depression
[56:19] or or wanting to grow in grace and
[56:21] knowledge and get rid of all the all the
[56:23] vices of the world and let those things
[56:26] fall away this is the mighty conqueror
[56:28] that had come down from glory to and and
[56:30] he he his the evidence of it that he had
[56:33] all the swatches of all those things all
[56:35] those things that he had defeated so
[56:37] isaiah saw he saw he saw a real king
[56:40] in the vision he saw a real example
[56:43] he saw a vision of every enemy defeated
[56:46] you every enemy can be defeated tonight
[56:50] when he got in the presence of the
[56:51] heavenly king he had been under the
[56:52] influence of an earthly king but he saw
[56:54] the vision of the true king and
[56:56] understood he understood what real
[56:58] influence influence really was
[57:03] you know there's a lot of earthly
[57:04] influences now
[57:07] you might have seen an earthly king or
[57:09] been under the influence of some kind of
[57:11] earthly influence and thought everything
[57:12] was okay whether it's your friends or
[57:14] the world or or all these mindless
[57:16] pastimes
[57:18] or tv shows but when you catch the
[57:20] vision that there's a greater influence
[57:22] there's a heavenly king that longs to be
[57:24] reverenced in humility and active
[57:26] worship
[57:27] then it'll change your perspective
[57:31] what that's what the gospel is the
[57:33] gospel preached brings you into
[57:34] relationship and fellowship with that
[57:36] heavenly king
[57:37] it brings you into a place where you
[57:39] know maybe tonight if you've thought
[57:40] where i've never i've never been in the
[57:42] presence of god i've never felt his
[57:44] presence i don't know if he's real or
[57:45] not but yet the gospel preached will
[57:47] bring you into that kind of an
[57:48] atmosphere i've never had my heart moved
[57:51] i've heard people say that i've never
[57:52] i've never had my heart move their heart
[57:54] gets kind of stony but the bible says in
[57:56] ezekiel 36 that he'll take that stony
[57:58] heart and soften it up soften it up so
[58:01] that the word can have an effect in it
[58:03] that's what the gospel does if you feel
[58:05] like you've never been moved into the
[58:07] holy of holies into that influence into
[58:09] that atmosphere of influence that's what
[58:11] the gospel is for
[58:13] brother abraham said in the handwriting
[58:14] on the wall he said
[58:16] dear heavenly father as i look down here
[58:18] and see men and women bow at the altar
[58:20] under the influence of the gospel
[58:23] oh so happy lord that we have something
[58:25] that puts us under an influence
[58:27] it isn't a strong drink it's the wine of
[58:30] pentecost
[58:31] it influences us to do the right thing
[58:33] to do right it takes all the wrong away
[58:36] and makes it right that's the kind of
[58:38] influence that we've got this afternoon
[58:40] tonight
[58:41] now the bible says in verse two above it
[58:43] stood the seraphims and each one had six
[58:45] wings with twain he covered his face and
[58:48] with twain he covered his feet and with
[58:49] twain he fly he he didn't fly so we see
[58:52] the first thing that isaiah saw those
[58:55] the the wings over their face
[58:57] you know whenever you get into the
[58:59] presence of god you're supposed to
[59:00] become reverent
[59:02] when we come into the house of the lord
[59:04] we're supposed to be reverend it's
[59:05] supposed to you why because you realize
[59:08] you realize there's somebody here
[59:10] that ain't it ain't just the minister
[59:12] behind the platform and it ain't just
[59:13] the people sitting next to me
[59:16] sorry kaylee i know she gets she said
[59:18] dad you sound so country sometimes
[59:22] it ain't it ain't this and it ain't that
[59:24] but what it is
[59:29] what it is
[59:30] is this the presence of a living god
[59:33] in his people
[59:34] and we know that god is here because
[59:36] wherever his word he's here and that
[59:38] makes us become reverent you know you
[59:40] think about blind bartimaeus sitting
[59:42] there with his eyes closed and we heard
[59:44] them calling out that jesus was coming
[59:46] he began to recognize
[59:48] that christ was there and he began to
[59:50] get reverent and the bible says he heard
[59:52] that it was jesus of nazareth he began
[59:54] to cry out and say jesus thou son of
[59:57] david have mercy on me and he began to
[59:59] humiliate himself that i i need some
[1:00:02] help
[1:00:02] i i need some help moses when he got in
[1:00:05] the presence of a living god and he took
[1:00:06] his shoes off out of reverence he wasn't
[1:00:09] he wasn't there at that burning bush
[1:00:10] chewing chewing gum and
[1:00:12] gnawing on it like like he was
[1:00:17] cracking jokes you know like you know
[1:00:19] when when you come to church it's
[1:00:21] supposed to be reverent where you're not
[1:00:22] chewing chewing gums and cracking jokes
[1:00:24] and and bringing we you know we don't
[1:00:26] bring drinks into the church or look on
[1:00:28] our iphones and ipods and everything
[1:00:29] because we're we're in a place of
[1:00:31] reverence
[1:00:32] reverence
[1:00:34] paul on the ground when he fell only
[1:00:35] fell on his face when he saw that light
[1:00:37] because he knew that there was somebody
[1:00:39] there and what what i think sometimes we
[1:00:42] we fail to realize
[1:00:43] when when it's when that's our home
[1:00:45] ministers and we kind of get into the
[1:00:46] same rut and we fail to realize that god
[1:00:49] is here
[1:00:50] you believe that tonight that god is
[1:00:51] still with us
[1:00:53] and you're in your dark times and your
[1:00:55] bad times when you come to church and
[1:00:57] it's the same old ministers up there
[1:00:59] behind the platform and the same old
[1:01:00] people at church but yet yet god is
[1:01:03] still on his throne he's still alive and
[1:01:06] well i have confidence in that tonight i
[1:01:09] have you know brother i'm said that they
[1:01:10] had two wings to cover it over their
[1:01:12] faith but we've got a blood covering
[1:01:14] we're covered over by the holy ghost in
[1:01:16] us tonight the life of christ in us is
[1:01:18] covering us over and we can have
[1:01:20] confidence in that tonight
[1:01:22] and he said he said people have no
[1:01:24] reverence men take a stand for the word
[1:01:26] of god and say i'm going to have my
[1:01:27] congregation cleaned up the first thing
[1:01:29] you know a complaint comes in from
[1:01:31] somebody else and they asked him he's
[1:01:32] got to go out on the street why because
[1:01:35] they're not convinced of his presence
[1:01:37] people get so used to the same old they
[1:01:39] just think it's just common and somebody
[1:01:41] begins to take a stand for the word of
[1:01:43] god and they think that god is not in it
[1:01:45] and he's talking about people throwing
[1:01:47] throwing ministers out on the street i
[1:01:48] don't want to hear that anymore because
[1:01:50] they're not convinced of his presence
[1:01:52] not convinced of his presence
[1:01:55] and then they had they that with twain
[1:01:57] he covered his face and with twain he
[1:01:59] covered his feet and and over their feet
[1:02:01] because that represented humility
[1:02:03] and brother adam said and he said here's
[1:02:05] a good example always be conscious of
[1:02:07] your littleness
[1:02:08] not your bigness
[1:02:10] he said today we americans so much that
[1:02:12] we try to think that we're big somebody
[1:02:15] it that's strange that even in the
[1:02:17] church you know sometimes people want to
[1:02:19] be big because you think listen the way
[1:02:22] to go up is the way is to go down as far
[1:02:25] as you can just get so lit brother brown
[1:02:28] said in one place he said humility is a
[1:02:30] way to success
[1:02:32] if you want to be successful be prepared
[1:02:34] to be removed and not even have your job
[1:02:36] anymore be prepared to just step out of
[1:02:38] the way that's the way to be successful
[1:02:40] to realize that you could be you could
[1:02:42] be taking you could go out of the scene
[1:02:44] and the church would still keep going
[1:02:46] right along
[1:02:47] you know you never you never stop and
[1:02:49] think about that if if you were to die
[1:02:51] right now your family would keep going
[1:02:53] right along
[1:02:54] the church would keep going right along
[1:02:55] and brother brown compared it to
[1:02:57] sticking your finger in a bucket and
[1:02:58] taking your finger out of that bucket
[1:03:00] and see see what an impression your your
[1:03:02] finger made in that water
[1:03:04] that's humility
[1:03:05] humility that's how you come to success
[1:03:08] he said that's what that's what makes
[1:03:10] him god to me because he humbled himself
[1:03:13] god is humility don't never forget that
[1:03:16] humility
[1:03:17] is god
[1:03:19] humility is god
[1:03:21] never boastful
[1:03:22] it's always humility
[1:03:25] you know cs lewis said humility is not
[1:03:27] thinking less of yourself as thinking of
[1:03:28] yourself less
[1:03:32] because when you're thinking all the
[1:03:33] time about how great you are and how
[1:03:35] everybody needs to pay more attention to
[1:03:36] you and how you deserve this and how you
[1:03:38] deserve that then you're rising above
[1:03:40] humility but humility is realizing that
[1:03:42] you could you could be removed from the
[1:03:44] equation and everything would just keep
[1:03:45] right going going along
[1:03:48] like that woman that bro that
[1:03:50] that she came to jesus and jesus told
[1:03:52] her that the meat
[1:03:54] it's not meat to take the children's
[1:03:55] bread and cast it to dogs
[1:03:57] but she humbled herself and said yeah
[1:03:59] but even when when crumbs fall off the
[1:04:01] table the the dogs get a little bit of
[1:04:03] that blessing
[1:04:04] if you can come with humility like the
[1:04:06] woman at the well the brother on them
[1:04:07] said she put her wings quickly over her
[1:04:09] face when jesus began to call out the
[1:04:11] sins in her life and began to tell her
[1:04:13] where she had been wrong and she didn't
[1:04:15] rile up and said you can't tell me
[1:04:18] i'm this or i'm that but she she humbled
[1:04:20] herself and she said
[1:04:22] i believe i believe you're the messiah
[1:04:24] he said her wings quickly went over her
[1:04:26] face the wings went over her feet she
[1:04:28] said sir
[1:04:29] sir the best i know you must be a
[1:04:31] prophet
[1:04:32] and he said then she went into action
[1:04:34] come see a man
[1:04:36] and that's what the next verse is their
[1:04:38] wings were over their their wings in it
[1:04:40] flying where they were in action
[1:04:42] because when you come from the influence
[1:04:44] of the presence of god it puts you into
[1:04:46] action and brother i haven't said how
[1:04:47] it's been through the age how that when
[1:04:49] men of old and all ages when they would
[1:04:51] really find the word of god and could
[1:04:53] grasp it faith went into action
[1:04:56] right away
[1:04:57] like peter
[1:04:58] when jesus told him to cast his net on
[1:05:00] the other side and he said at that word
[1:05:02] i'm gonna do it he didn't say well i'm
[1:05:03] not gonna do it when you when you catch
[1:05:05] a glimpse of the influence of god you'll
[1:05:07] go down into the water to be baptized
[1:05:09] because he told you to do it when you
[1:05:12] realize that that the the the word says
[1:05:14] you need to be born again you'll go into
[1:05:16] action
[1:05:17] i remember when i first saw saw in the
[1:05:20] word that i needed to be born again i i
[1:05:22] certainly went into action
[1:05:24] something began to cry out within my
[1:05:25] heart that i need something and maybe
[1:05:28] tonight if something's within your heart
[1:05:29] if you can feel that pulse setting in
[1:05:31] your heart like brother ham talked about
[1:05:32] and looking to the unseen that you need
[1:05:34] something maybe it's time to go into the
[1:05:36] action into action tonight maybe it's
[1:05:38] time to reach out by faith and and claim
[1:05:40] maybe maybe it's time to go into action
[1:05:42] for your family and claim your family
[1:05:44] and say i i put up with with with
[1:05:47] disjointedness and and bickering and and
[1:05:50] all kinds of things in my home long
[1:05:52] enough and it's time it's time to go
[1:05:54] into action he said that's right when
[1:05:56] you got courage to put your faith in
[1:05:58] action when you see you got faith and
[1:06:00] afraid to let it go your faith is dead
[1:06:03] but when you've got faith and willing to
[1:06:04] let it go
[1:06:06] then god's confirming it with his signs
[1:06:08] following and you'll see your healing
[1:06:10] i i believe like brother wade's always
[1:06:12] telling us it's time to let our faith go
[1:06:15] you got faith by the new birth so let it
[1:06:17] go you got faith in there so so put it
[1:06:20] to work put it into action for your
[1:06:21] family put it to work in your prayer
[1:06:24] life put it to work in your job put it
[1:06:26] to work and see god come on the scene
[1:06:28] for you
[1:06:31] brother ram said in faith in action he
[1:06:32] said no matter how much faith you got if
[1:06:35] you won't use it it's no good to you
[1:06:37] what good is the god of moses if he
[1:06:39] ain't the same god today
[1:06:41] what good is a historical god you people
[1:06:43] who go to church and your church only
[1:06:45] teaches that some historical fact about
[1:06:47] the holy ghost coming back on the day of
[1:06:48] pentecost there's no such a thing today
[1:06:50] that was healing back there what good
[1:06:52] does that do to you
[1:06:54] just no more than reading george
[1:06:56] washington once lived
[1:06:57] he's still he's still the same yesterday
[1:07:00] today and forever
[1:07:02] god is here we recognize it and we
[1:07:04] believe it
[1:07:05] we believe that he's still the same god
[1:07:08] we believe that he's still here to prove
[1:07:10] his word
[1:07:13] and brother ram said in the influence of
[1:07:15] another he said faith
[1:07:17] faith ignores all the circumstances
[1:07:19] it doesn't look at symptoms
[1:07:21] it ignores what people say
[1:07:24] it's not ashamed it has no hindrance
[1:07:27] it knows where it stands
[1:07:29] it says shut up and sit down
[1:07:31] it won't take no for an answer
[1:07:35] you think about that tonight maybe when
[1:07:36] you're going home the faith
[1:07:38] will not take no for an answer
[1:07:43] maybe if you're looking at your family
[1:07:45] and it's all in disarray and your kids
[1:07:47] are doing things they shouldn't be doing
[1:07:48] and
[1:07:49] maybe your spouse is doing stuff they're
[1:07:50] not maybe you're doing stuff that you
[1:07:52] shouldn't be doing
[1:07:54] reach out by faith and don't take no for
[1:07:57] an answer
[1:07:58] because if god's promise if it's laying
[1:08:00] there in his word
[1:08:02] he promised it and he's going to produce
[1:08:04] it
[1:08:09] and mary's belief brother ryan said it's
[1:08:11] not me to try to figure it out it takes
[1:08:12] the word of the holy spirit
[1:08:14] he was the one who made the promise he's
[1:08:16] the one who confirms the promise
[1:08:19] and he's obligated to keep that promise
[1:08:22] so spread your wings out
[1:08:24] spread your wings out of reverence and
[1:08:26] humility of action
[1:08:28] take god at his word because god's
[1:08:30] calling us higher
[1:08:32] you know he's calling us higher than
[1:08:33] those seraphims he's calling us to
[1:08:35] position of the sons and daughters of
[1:08:37] the king
[1:08:38] he's calling us into an atmosphere
[1:08:42] now the bible says above it stood the
[1:08:44] seraphims and we'll close in just a
[1:08:45] minute i don't intend to keep you too
[1:08:47] long tonight
[1:08:48] each one has six wings with twain he
[1:08:50] covered his face and with twain he
[1:08:51] covered his feet and with twain it did
[1:08:53] fly and one cried unto another and said
[1:08:55] holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the
[1:08:58] whole earth is full of glory
[1:09:00] and that brought that brought isaiah to
[1:09:02] a place of confession where he began to
[1:09:04] he said i then said i woe is me for i am
[1:09:07] undone because i am a man of unclean
[1:09:09] lips
[1:09:10] and i dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:09:12] unclean lips
[1:09:13] for mine eyes have seen the king
[1:09:16] the lord of hosts
[1:09:19] it brought him to a place of true
[1:09:20] worship where he realized he had been
[1:09:22] looking at the wrong at the wrong thing
[1:09:24] he thought he could see all that time he
[1:09:25] was looking at uzziah
[1:09:27] but all this time his lips were unclean
[1:09:29] and he didn't realize it
[1:09:31] and he began to look inward to realize
[1:09:34] woe is me
[1:09:36] he had been misplaced in his reverence
[1:09:39] your your
[1:09:40] your reverence is misplaced if you're
[1:09:42] looking at yourself or looking at others
[1:09:44] but if you look at jesus christ
[1:09:47] we're so preoccupied and looking with
[1:09:49] one another you know but our our enemy
[1:09:51] is it ourselves
[1:09:53] our enemies and you know what a
[1:09:55] confession a confession like isaiah made
[1:09:57] a confession is when you begin to admit
[1:09:59] that you're wrong a confession is that a
[1:10:01] mission or acknowledgement that one has
[1:10:03] done something that one is ashamed or
[1:10:05] embarrassed about
[1:10:06] he acknowledged that he was wrong
[1:10:09] and that's when the seraphim came down
[1:10:10] with a live coal in his hand which he
[1:10:13] had taken with the tones from off the
[1:10:14] altar and he laid it upon his mouth and
[1:10:16] said lo and isaiah said lo this hath
[1:10:19] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[1:10:22] taken away
[1:10:23] and thy sin purged
[1:10:26] brother in the message testimony he said
[1:10:27] i tell you this old-time religion
[1:10:29] brother has straightened you up
[1:10:31] that's what this gospel is for us to
[1:10:33] straighten us up to clean up our lives
[1:10:35] so we can rock straight he said it'll
[1:10:37] make a silk dress and a calico put their
[1:10:39] arms around one another and call sister
[1:10:41] is that right
[1:10:42] it'll make a tuxedo suit and a pair of
[1:10:44] overalls call each other brother that's
[1:10:45] what it'll do
[1:10:47] what what does it do it's changing your
[1:10:48] nature
[1:10:50] it changes you that's why you've got to
[1:10:52] be born again
[1:10:53] it'll change the way you think
[1:10:55] it'll change your desires it'll change
[1:10:58] you so that we you won't want to marry a
[1:11:01] girl you young man you won't want to
[1:11:03] marry a girl walking around with pants
[1:11:05] showing herself off to the world and you
[1:11:07] young ladies you won't want to marry
[1:11:09] some some knucklehead with his his hair
[1:11:12] slicked back and
[1:11:14] don't know nothing about god and doesn't
[1:11:15] love you or love god
[1:11:17] it'll change what you're after it'll
[1:11:19] change it'll change your it he said
[1:11:22] it'll clean you up it'll
[1:11:24] it tears down that self and starch and
[1:11:26] pride that we've got it tears all that
[1:11:28] down
[1:11:29] that's right these young men coming
[1:11:31] around their knuckleheads i'll see it
[1:11:33] again that makes people laugh but
[1:11:38] yes sir and listen any god any christian
[1:11:40] man has a right to stand at the door of
[1:11:42] his home and say and and
[1:11:45] and call black black and white white
[1:11:47] when when
[1:11:49] you've you've got a right to protect
[1:11:51] your home
[1:11:54] listen that cherubim come down with a
[1:11:56] coal of fire off the altar that he had
[1:11:57] took with his tongues and and he cleaned
[1:12:00] things up that's what that's what the
[1:12:01] gospel is for that's what god wants to
[1:12:03] do in your life tonight
[1:12:05] it's clean things up he don't want you
[1:12:07] living in sin he don't want you living
[1:12:09] in the muck and the mire of the world
[1:12:11] but he wants you to live a clean holy
[1:12:13] life with a testimony where you can
[1:12:16] influence other people
[1:12:18] now now you young people and old people
[1:12:20] are like and everybody in between
[1:12:22] wouldn't you love tonight to have an
[1:12:23] influence have a life like that where
[1:12:26] you could have with you know one of the
[1:12:28] greatest things that you can have your
[1:12:29] kids to ever say is you have been an
[1:12:32] influence to me
[1:12:34] wouldn't you love to have your children
[1:12:35] tonight or people in the church look to
[1:12:37] you as an influence that i know and i'm
[1:12:39] thinking here tonight as i'm saying
[1:12:41] these things there's many of you tonight
[1:12:43] that i think of when i think of prayer
[1:12:45] warriors and people that are touched by
[1:12:47] other things that people are going
[1:12:49] through and people that are helps and
[1:12:51] people that have helped me that have
[1:12:52] been an influence to me i'm thinking
[1:12:54] about you tonight that you were an
[1:12:56] influence to me
[1:12:57] you are an influence
[1:13:00] what a great testimony to be an
[1:13:02] influence to other people
[1:13:06] the bible says in in verse 8 also i
[1:13:09] heard the voice of the lord saying whom
[1:13:10] shall i see and then who will go for us
[1:13:13] then said i hear am i send me
[1:13:16] because when god when god calls you when
[1:13:18] you made your confession and when he
[1:13:19] cleans you up he wants to clean you up
[1:13:22] so he can do something with you
[1:13:25] that's what the baptism of the holy
[1:13:26] ghost is for so that he can come and
[1:13:28] live in you and be an influence to
[1:13:30] people and he'll commission you he puts
[1:13:32] you into service into his army that's
[1:13:34] what a commission is when when a
[1:13:36] military officer gets this commission is
[1:13:38] to go and be an officer in the army and
[1:13:41] you've been commissioned when you
[1:13:42] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:44] the musicians can go ahead and come
[1:13:45] forward
[1:13:46] to be to be an officer in the army of
[1:13:48] the lord
[1:13:49] to be a soldier in the army of the lord
[1:13:52] you've been commissioned by an influence
[1:13:54] from above commission what what to do
[1:13:58] to be an influence to others so when
[1:14:00] people look at you
[1:14:02] they're influenced the same way as
[1:14:04] isaiah was when he got called up into
[1:14:07] that vision
[1:14:08] he saw the lord high and lifted up on
[1:14:10] his throne
[1:14:12] but people when they look at you they'll
[1:14:13] see christ just seated on the throne of
[1:14:15] your heart and you'll be an influence to
[1:14:18] them
