[8:57] direct us in Jesus name Amen Jonah -
[9:04] we'll just go to verse 9 and 10 so we
[9:08] went through the whole thing there last
[9:10] Sunday but notice he said but I will
[9:13] sacrifice now this is Jonah in the belly
[9:15] of the whale and he's come down through
[9:18] telling the things of where he was at
[9:20] and all that's lying vanities and he was
[9:22] looking to the Lord
[9:24] alright but I will sacrifice unto thee
[9:27] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[9:30] pay that that I have vowed salvation is
[9:35] of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the
[9:38] feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the
[9:41] dry land alright now let's go to Roman's
[9:45] I hope we get this far
[9:52] romans 4 what should we say then that
[9:57] Abraham our Father as pertaining to the
[10:01] flesh hath found for if Abraham were
[10:04] justified by works he had were of to
[10:07] glory but not before God for what saith
[10:11] the scripture know what says this they
[10:14] into our Bible Oh new no matter what
[10:17] what saith the scripture abraham
[10:21] believed god
[10:22] and it was counted unto him for
[10:25] righteousness you may be seated the Lord
[10:28] at his blessing to the reading of the
[10:30] word now we have two announcements and
[10:33] so y'all have to get that part straight
[10:35] the Monaco's class we'll be meeting in
[10:39] the sanctuary at 12:45 all right so
[10:43] that's the practice but then we wound up
[10:45] getting another one it says boys and
[10:47] Monica's Sunday School classes is to
[10:49] meet in the afternoon or meet this
[10:52] afternoon in between the services and
[10:55] after second service so everybody get
[10:59] that straight so that you're going to be
[11:01] meeting between the services today and
[11:04] then your meeting after the services so
[11:07] you make sure and get that to where that
[11:10] you'll know where you're supposed to be
[11:11] another on the board's class in Monica's
[11:14] class right now we've read here and we
[11:19] see that the scripture firmly declares
[11:25] salvation is of the Lord all right now
[11:31] salvation is not of the Lord and man it
[11:37] is not something that you can do is not
[11:41] something that you could not do and
[11:44] merit or anything it's just plain
[11:47] language that salvation is of the Lord
[11:49] all right now what I've started is a
[11:52] series part on salvation that we want to
[11:57] you know get into and so we're back in
[12:02] the Old Testament now you know the way I
[12:04] do I bring everything back to the very
[12:07] groundwork and I begin it's a very
[12:12] beginning I don't just jump into
[12:13] something and take all I try to go all
[12:16] the way back and get to that point all
[12:20] right so then salvation Jonah said is of
[12:25] the Lord all right now we found that the
[12:30] word salvation there in Jonah is to live
[12:37] as well fire is prosperity or our
[12:41] victory and it comes from the word
[12:46] that's the same meaning as Joshua all
[12:51] right which goes back to your hova C
[12:53] which goes all the way back to Jesus
[12:55] Christ so we know that all will tie
[12:57] together and bring it out to the New
[12:59] Testament eventually but we're trying to
[13:02] stay in the Old Testament all right now
[13:05] the purpose is one thing if Hebrews 13:8
[13:10] is correct and we do believe that then
[13:13] whatever salvation is in the Old
[13:15] Testament it will be in the new whatever
[13:17] it is in the new will be that of the old
[13:19] now there's a differential between the
[13:22] salvation right because of the way
[13:26] you've got it laid out and the way that
[13:27] it comes and what happens of the Old
[13:30] Testament and how that the blood of
[13:32] Jesus Christ was not dire if it was the
[13:35] blood of bulls and goats
[13:36] all right there's it you know we'll have
[13:38] to divide that as we come along but just
[13:41] remember it's the things that you base
[13:44] your salvation on today that's what they
[13:47] based their salvation on back directly
[13:50] and you said no no they put doesn't know
[13:52] they didn't have their salvation on the
[13:54] blood of bulls and gold they had their
[13:58] salvation of what God told them to do
[14:01] you know follow that and keep it in your
[14:03] mind it's what God told them to do more
[14:08] than just saying this that or the other
[14:10] you know but it'll all be based upon
[14:12] those time all right we went through
[14:14] talking about that to consider one thing
[14:21] it's used as deliverance in the olden
[14:26] deliverer deliverance in the new so no
[14:29] matter what you're talking about
[14:31] your thought is to have deliverance
[14:35] because that's what salvation is
[14:38] salvation is deliverance from the
[14:41] situation you're in so then that way the
[14:44] word salvation can apply as we said
[14:46] about Moses when he said stands to
[14:50] and see the salvation of the Lord when
[14:52] the Red Sea was fixing to part in them
[14:55] going across all right the word
[14:57] salvation then meaning deliverance all
[15:01] right so you'll find salvation in the
[15:04] Old Testament
[15:06] deliverance all right now so you use it
[15:10] to that as I said then you use the blood
[15:12] of bulls and goats for the atonement but
[15:17] the deliverance was there all right then
[15:21] we will miss progress throughout the Old
[15:24] Testament coming up to the point of
[15:27] bringing it to our day in our time okay
[15:32] now what did we cover then there this
[15:36] past Wednesday what is salvation based
[15:39] upon now remember whatever it's based
[15:44] upon dire it'll be based upon that here
[15:48] now get what I'm saying now so don't run
[15:51] it off when we get to the point just
[15:53] remember in the Old Testament it was
[15:56] based upon the blood but it was an
[15:58] animal blood but it was still the blood
[16:00] and it was still alive
[16:02] you know went out all right then you
[16:05] come to the New Testament of Jesus
[16:07] Christ
[16:08] so just stay with me now back in the Old
[16:10] Testament part two to help and find an
[16:13] understanding better Branham on the
[16:16] message God keeps his word he said
[16:20] salvation is based upon the teaching of
[16:24] the Bible all right
[16:29] salvation is based upon the teaching or
[16:32] whatever the Bible says is what your
[16:35] salvation is based upon alright so now
[16:38] we know for sure he's in that salvation
[16:42] is based upon the Word of God all right
[16:46] now we went through that to showing you
[16:49] that even though it was not the written
[16:51] letter it was still dire as the Word of
[16:56] God and it came down to form what we
[17:00] have as to be called the led
[17:03] the word all right now so it's based
[17:07] upon the Word of God now remember it's
[17:16] based upon the Word of God listen you
[17:18] know to get an understanding to me I
[17:22] when I think about the Bible the thing
[17:24] about the Word of God I think of the
[17:27] basis that it's based upon what God says
[17:32] right now so then all the way through
[17:37] the Old Testament you'll find him
[17:39] speaking to mankind right bringing forth
[17:47] his understanding to mankind to bring us
[17:52] to deliver us but we know that the Old
[17:55] Testament said we know that that one sin
[17:57] entered the picture
[17:58] then we sent spent so long you know
[18:01] bringing this the emphasis down that
[18:04] once sin entered the picture that it
[18:08] didn't matter after Adam and Eve all
[18:10] mankind didn't matter if it was able
[18:14] able remember son this past Wednesday a
[18:17] boy was just as perverted as okay oh no
[18:21] April was from Adam he came through the
[18:27] same wound and that's where the
[18:30] pollution was at all right that was what
[18:32] was messed up
[18:33] but it was what first through the wound
[18:36] of his mind then through the physical
[18:39] all right so then there was nothing born
[18:42] after you know look at the sin in the
[18:47] garden that could be worth anything
[18:51] he all would be born in sin shapen in
[18:55] iniquity and spouse from another's wound
[18:58] and going forth alive all right
[19:02] then it wouldn't be something that we
[19:04] could be like the people of the message
[19:06] want to say I come with eternal life
[19:10] well then all right now I'm as honest as
[19:13] can be if you're gonna come with eternal
[19:16] life let's
[19:16] stow the Bible away because what good is
[19:22] what good is the Bible
[19:24] I thought the Bible was what told us how
[19:31] we've lost I thought the law when we'll
[19:37] see how it comes into gets involved in
[19:40] the salvation that we'll see in the law
[19:43] that it was a record keeper or a maker
[19:47] known the law was - were it would make
[19:52] us known that we're sinners all right so
[19:56] then you might watch though the whole
[19:57] Bible away if you say you come with
[19:59] eternal life go what do you need Jesus
[20:02] Christ
[20:03] oh brother Branham said I did let her
[20:08] kill it but the spirit the revealed word
[20:15] gives life we went to those things
[20:18] covered them when everyone said if you
[20:21] have eternal life if you have eternal
[20:26] life the eternal life always was eternal
[20:29] not you right so then we've got the
[20:35] point settle to what we're talking about
[20:37] and we're trying to find deliverance but
[20:40] we're going to find out the biggest
[20:42] point of deliverance is delivering us
[20:45] from the carnality of the mind because
[20:50] that was what he said in the garden I
[20:53] mean - to them that was
[20:54] I'll put enmity the carnal mind enmity
[21:01] because that's where Satan went straight
[21:03] to Eve and polluted that mind with
[21:06] everything since then it's polluted
[21:10] that's why when Jesus Christ came it
[21:13] wasn't necessary that he is a human
[21:17] being step into you as a human begin to
[21:21] try to give you eternal life you
[21:22] understand what I'm saying now it wasn't
[21:25] for him physically step into you
[21:27] physically
[21:29] Ronit you start in the New Testament the
[21:33] same way as a Salvation at Ulta it
[21:36] starts in the mind because that was
[21:38] where the pollution started right so now
[21:42] that's what we're dealing with I'm
[21:43] dealing with mines because I'm looking
[21:46] at him huh
[21:48] and knowing that you and what Satan does
[21:53] that's why we use that scripture so much
[21:57] that Paul said he was afraid that he
[22:00] that Satan through his subtilty would do
[22:03] the same thing too and he was talking to
[22:06] Christians to their mind that was done
[22:10] to Eve's mine all right now so salvation
[22:15] is based upon the Word of God now don't
[22:21] worry about it we'll get to it in a
[22:22] second because the Word of God declares
[22:24] remember when's the Word of God is what
[22:27] declared the blood to be the atonement
[22:29] so come on now just stay with me and
[22:31] listen all right now so then it's based
[22:35] upon what God has already said remember
[22:40] we read that from the Prophet that
[22:42] salvation is based upon the past because
[22:46] it's already said it's already done
[22:49] he declared before the world that he
[22:51] saved us before the world all the thing
[22:53] all right was declared back there to
[22:56] come down to where we're at now
[22:57] all right now we went through the point
[23:03] of talking about the blood that God then
[23:09] showed what his point was because when
[23:15] mankind fail he made the first atonement
[23:21] remember that Wednesday he was the one
[23:24] that killed the animals I gave you the
[23:28] quote from the Prophet all right were
[23:31] God killed the animals and took the
[23:35] skins and put them on Adam and Eve as
[23:37] the atonement so it was a blood
[23:40] atonement all right but the
[23:41] word had already spoken me right
[23:46] remember that the word had spoken out
[23:48] put enmity between thy seed and the seed
[23:50] of the woman he had already spoken and
[23:54] said what would take place all right
[23:56] that it would be a blood atonement
[23:59] because he sacrificed himself the blood
[24:03] of the animals and that's what's so hard
[24:06] I hope it I hope it don't own you a
[24:09] little bit after months and months of
[24:11] trying to show and talk about the the
[24:14] point of how real God is I hope that
[24:18] continues on into your thoughts and not
[24:20] this sentence our thinking now how did
[24:24] God kill them I thought God was a spirit
[24:29] kill an animal even God would be that
[24:34] horrible that he would kill the animals
[24:39] that's exactly what the Bible says the
[24:44] Bible says there in Genesis 3:21 that
[24:47] God made coats well I just don't believe
[24:54] God is that real well that's good you
[24:59] think you're more real in here that's
[25:03] what gets me people who say well I just
[25:06] don't believe God is that he's not that
[25:08] tangible he would take something
[25:10] tangible to kill an animal
[25:12] I thought your prophet said he's not a
[25:16] myth I thought he said he was a person I
[25:21] thought he said he was a being but see
[25:26] we we want to put it things because
[25:28] that's Satan's still talking now are you
[25:31] following me that is Satan still talking
[25:35] to your mind just as he did to Eve in
[25:37] the garden time to get you to reason out
[25:41] things instead of accepting what God
[25:44] says and seeing that God himself
[25:50] applied the blood
[25:53] because that was the only thing that
[25:55] could take place that would speak then
[25:58] of Christ's coming
[26:00] I'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[26:02] one and the seed of the woman one would
[26:05] all have a seed Jesus Christ is the seed
[26:07] of the woman so it spoke right to our
[26:09] Genesis right as quick as a fall King
[26:12] and brother Branham said actually I can
[26:15] give you the quote where he said they
[26:17] were actually on the way out of the
[26:19] garden
[26:25] Lettie skins flopping with blood running
[26:28] all over them and said then God said but
[26:33] I'll put enmity between thy seed Nativa
[26:35] the one see he specifies worthy put his
[26:40] telling them what it was the atonement
[26:42] which would be you know - Jesus Christ
[26:45] alright you follow me see then it would
[26:48] be by applying the blood and we see God
[26:52] himself laid out right around says the
[26:55] welcome mat you remember that one the
[27:01] way the way to have fellowship God laid
[27:05] out the welcome mat back to Adam and Eve
[27:13] by the killing of the animals there was
[27:15] a welcome that they made you're told
[27:19] that he said decade how fellowship again
[27:21] that's what your prophet says through
[27:25] the blood of Jesus Christ that God
[27:29] Himself taking that blood I remember
[27:33] what I guess it was rabbi Richmond I
[27:37] can't remember but it made it it it
[27:40] really dawned on me in thinking about it
[27:43] because he said don't think about Oh in
[27:47] the Old Testament all those animals
[27:49] being offered as something that's
[27:51] horrible
[27:51] said think of love and that really don't
[27:56] know me to think they went out an animal
[27:59] was dire that was love you know well
[28:04] that's not love to cut some throat
[28:06] kicking it is when you know what's
[28:08] taking place right now
[28:12] but it's true believing what God says
[28:19] salvations based upon what God says all
[28:23] right it's based upon the blood so now
[28:27] it'll always be based upon what he says
[28:30] right he'll always be based upon the
[28:33] blood it was changed from the blood of
[28:36] an animal to the blood of a human but it
[28:39] still be based upon blood Kody's always
[28:43] that's why brother brother said it about
[28:45] Abel
[28:46] he said Abel knew that he was born in
[28:50] his mother's blood from his father's
[28:54] blood right blood atonement okay now
[29:02] time to get down to the point then when
[29:04] continuing to message the brother Brian
[29:07] said on the message surge we would see
[29:08] Jesus who gave you that Windus T then
[29:14] the salvation is not based upon what
[29:17] someone else says salvation is not based
[29:27] upon what somebody else says alright now
[29:31] so we've we've been through the message
[29:32] we know we don't have to spend lengthy
[29:35] quotations on the doing that for you to
[29:38] say what somebody else says it's good
[29:41] but there's no salvation in it you don't
[29:45] save you to say what somebody else says
[29:50] we'll get to it in Romans minute when
[29:52] you speak from your heart it don't save
[29:54] you now listen it don't save you because
[29:57] your mother said it don't save you cause
[30:00] your daddy said it don't say because the
[30:03] Prophet said it don't say you say
[30:06] because God said it oh you've got a
[30:10] little stronger definitely you kind of
[30:13] you went a man in any way amen
[30:16] you
[30:17] you can look slower on the life - there
[30:22] all right do you understand what I'm
[30:25] talking about if you're saying what
[30:27] somebody else says they said well we're
[30:31] only way we could say is what's on this
[30:32] hey man come on
[30:34] but if it's not something personal to
[30:35] you in the Bible the only people have
[30:42] ever amounted to anything was the people
[30:46] that believed God was speaking to them
[30:51] there wasn't that's never been based on
[30:54] God speaking to somebody else to come
[30:56] and tell you that's fine that's alright
[31:01] but it's not a revelation until it's
[31:03] revealed to you there's no salvation
[31:05] then in quoting somebody else remember
[31:09] what we was giving during the message
[31:11] surge we would see Jesus he said it's
[31:15] not based upon what someone else says
[31:21] it's based upon what you think of him
[31:28] and how he's speaking to you now based
[31:35] upon somebody else it's based upon what
[31:38] you think he's saying to you they will
[31:46] see then what had happened with abraham
[31:48] abraham believed God was speaking to him
[31:53] and when he believed God was speaking to
[31:56] him God reckoned it to Abraham that's
[32:01] faith so it's not based now upon what
[32:06] somebody else says I don't care who says
[32:09] it do you understand you go a little bit
[32:12] too far brother then when you say not
[32:14] based on what God says well if you're
[32:16] that's mentally incapable of spiritual
[32:19] revelation then you're in bad shape
[32:21] anyway if you don't understand
[32:25] somebody has always got to say something
[32:28] to you that's fine but it's got to be
[32:30] revealed
[32:31] what Sayyad that's what I'm talking
[32:33] about a revelation faith a revelation
[32:38] something that God is speaking to you I
[32:42] come out and I said brother Kali the
[32:44] Lord told me to tell you that's fine
[32:48] that can help him or whatever it is but
[32:52] that won't save it see that's why
[32:57] everybody wants it that way there was
[33:01] three or three or four of us seeking God
[33:03] at the same time when we came into the
[33:06] message and this one brother prayed for
[33:08] all of us one nodded he he said I
[33:11] believe every one of y'all got the Holy
[33:12] Ghost well you know I know two brothers
[33:17] that base their salvation upon the fact
[33:21] of that brother saying it when I'm kind
[33:26] of like the little little boy that says
[33:28] you know after they asked all of them
[33:30] done anything he said he ain't done
[33:32] nothing for me yeah I'm serious
[33:37] he could tell me all day long I say
[33:39] that's fine but until God told me I save
[33:45] it had nothing to do with it other than
[33:47] the lips of somebody else saying it and
[33:50] I would not take that and the true they
[33:53] took it or not he renounce okay all
[33:57] right you understand what I'm saying
[34:00] it's not based on what somebody upset us
[34:03] but it's based upon what God says to you
[34:07] now that doesn't matter whether it's Old
[34:09] Testament or New Testament abraham
[34:16] believed that God was speaking to him
[34:22] and when he believed it he accepted it
[34:28] as that and God counted it to Abraham
[34:31] for righteousness right or you followed
[34:36] me see we're making a basis for
[34:39] salvation now all the Old Testament is a
[34:42] basis for the New Testament salvation
[34:46] so I would listen and you hear me keep
[34:49] emphasizing throughout the time that
[34:53] okay that's what this was that's what
[34:57] this is
[34:59] they said based on the Word of God still
[35:02] based on the Word of God it was based on
[35:04] the blood it's still based on the blood
[35:06] his base don't believe in God was
[35:08] speaking to you it's still based don't
[35:10] believe in God is speaking to you yeah
[35:14] but you just you just shouldn't make it
[35:15] his arrogantly statements as you do okay
[35:20] at least you know I'm not trying to pull
[35:22] them over on you so you know where I
[35:24] stand
[35:26] what would you say right what would you
[35:32] say see we know blood was the way to
[35:39] fellowship but how do we know that was
[35:45] because God is the one that first done
[35:49] it
[35:50] are you following me now whatever he had
[35:55] done I like to the waist I don't
[35:59] remember her brother branham said it or
[36:00] not but I like if somebody made a good
[36:01] point were you know it says in the New
[36:04] Testament there about repent everyone
[36:06] and be baptized his name of Jesus Christ
[36:07] and said if Peter just said repent every
[36:10] one of you stand on your head said that
[36:13] would have been God's Word because God
[36:15] was putting it into the hands of Peter
[36:17] to say it right now so I believe God
[36:21] spoke to you and I by way of a prophet
[36:24] messenger to bring us the message but if
[36:28] it's not revealed you're still just as
[36:32] dead letter as can be you can read the
[36:37] Bible we read the Bible we studied the
[36:39] Bible but until it was revealed it's not
[36:45] the Word of God
[36:48] it's letters on a page and something you
[36:51] can burn up what is the church built a
[36:56] poem
[36:59] mom let's build on the revelation of
[37:02] Jesus Christ if the Old Testament is not
[37:07] correct in the way it was bro then there
[37:11] would be no New Testament are you are
[37:13] you following me so then we have to
[37:15] depend totally upon the fact of what the
[37:18] Old Testament says so when the Old
[37:21] Testament said that God made coats of
[37:23] skin Genesis 3:21 then it's God doing it
[37:31] remember the point of Jonah salvation is
[37:35] of the Lord it's not what you and I do
[37:41] remember we read that we're brother
[37:43] Branham gave it where he said salvation
[37:46] is not based upon praying when we read a
[37:51] whole length it's not based upon an
[37:54] experience not based upon them things
[37:58] it's not based upon sensation design but
[38:01] yet you're not going to be born again
[38:03] without a sensation and the experience
[38:06] of believing right all right but it's
[38:12] basing the salvation the deliverance not
[38:16] upon something you do but it's basing
[38:19] upon what you believe he's already done
[38:24] you come up say I want to be saved and
[38:27] I'd say well God done it for the
[38:29] foundation of the world yeah but I won't
[38:32] be saved well God done it for the
[38:33] foundation world what I want you to do
[38:38] is believe you down it and put it upon
[38:43] the basis of what God says
[38:45] now listen put it upon what God says to
[38:48] you personally to you not upon what he
[38:54] says to somebody else
[38:59] come on I thought that we believed in
[39:03] the prophets message and I thought the
[39:05] way we believed it was that he said one
[39:08] day like this and he said now I could
[39:10] tell you maybe what
[39:11] about that but he said now that wouldn't
[39:16] be what the Lord said and he said I
[39:20] wouldn't do that for nothing right is
[39:23] that what he said he said I'd never do
[39:25] he said because you'd get to where you
[39:26] depend on something that I say it
[39:32] Gloriana be greatly depend upon what God
[39:36] says in his word it's great to depend
[39:38] upon what the Prophet brought into it
[39:39] it's great to believe what God uses
[39:43] people to speak to us that's wonderful
[39:46] but the point of it is there's no
[39:48] salvation unless it becomes a personal a
[39:52] personal experience and see then the new
[39:58] birth will never be contrary to that see
[40:08] like I said I hope to god that this will
[40:12] tie back with the previous messages and
[40:16] if you'll get away from the basis that
[40:19] God is not real he's just a spirit he's
[40:24] just a spirit just an anointing just a
[40:26] spirit we believe that that's the Word
[40:29] of God but we believe God is real and
[40:35] God being real then what's the problem
[40:38] today now think about it they're gonna
[40:50] write our point it's based upon the word
[40:55] it's based upon the blood okay it's
[41:00] based upon your personally believing
[41:05] that God spoke to you all right now
[41:13] what's this go ahead with number one
[41:15] brothers we'll start with their
[41:17] quotation and look what the Bible says
[41:23] we're doing a great faith chapter save
[41:28] reading we come down see the song huh my
[41:31] faith Enoch was translated then he
[41:34] should not see death and was not found
[41:36] because God had translated him where
[41:39] before his translation he had this
[41:40] testimony that he pleased God now what
[41:43] does pleased God mean you remember well
[41:47] he was just such a great good guy is
[41:55] that all you can think that if it was
[42:00] necessary as we read to start with in
[42:04] Romans that Abraham to believe God
[42:09] before God would impute a reckoner count
[42:13] to Abraham the righteousness by faith
[42:18] would it not be the same thing about
[42:20] Enoch and we've been through it that's
[42:23] the same point you just keep reading
[42:25] where we gave you in Romans how that
[42:27] it's not reckoned unto works we know
[42:30] better so in the Old Testament see your
[42:33] mind is connected to thinking about
[42:36] works because you try to get the blow
[42:45] you try to get something better to do
[42:47] something to do this that cause remember
[42:49] we'll get down to it the law was God in
[42:52] the letter form huh but remember the law
[42:54] was never been added the law was added
[42:57] according to the scripture because of
[42:59] transgression and the transgression is
[43:02] people not believing what the Word of
[43:03] God says to keep it straight and they
[43:06] transgress now the law was a
[43:11] schoolmaster which is no salvation in
[43:14] the law and he said they made the
[43:20] biggest mistake they ever made by
[43:21] choosing law and we'll get to these
[43:24] times see they chose law thinking it was
[43:31] grace
[43:34] boom there's a message called offer
[43:37] grace listening to the Prophet so then
[43:40] remember whatever please God with
[43:43] Abraham is he's talking about
[43:45] pleasing God with C we want to talk
[43:50] about it oh he was just such a good guy
[43:52] well that's good that's fine I'm sure he
[43:56] was but he's still not based on the good
[43:59] guy now come on church we're no
[44:05] Testament I hope you stay with me in
[44:08] your mind it's not even in the Old
[44:10] Testament of being good makes you a
[44:11] Christian it might put you to a by pie
[44:18] situation or something for you to do
[44:20] what the law says and everything but
[44:24] remember all the Old Testament pointed
[44:28] to Jesus Christ you got to come to
[44:31] Christ to have a perfection from sin of
[44:34] the Old Testament it was just covered
[44:39] right come on before he is translation
[44:44] he had this testimony that he pleased
[44:46] God
[44:47] now watch without faith now where's your
[44:54] works at where's your doing we're just
[44:56] something you can do
[44:57] where do something you could make
[44:58] yourself better and God would honor it
[45:01] but without faith it is impossible to
[45:07] please him then watch it for he that
[45:15] cometh to God watch them must believe
[45:19] that he is is not Pais you know is his
[45:25] present tense he's right you're not you
[45:27] don't believe what he was doing with his
[45:29] present and watch now he that cometh to
[45:33] God must believe that he is whatever he
[45:38] was he still is
[45:40] come on and that he's a rewarder of them
[45:44] that diligently seek him now he that
[45:51] cometh to God must believe that he is do
[45:57] you know what that puts you all believe
[45:59] in the word believe in the blood leaving
[46:03] in personal experience with God not even
[46:07] talking about them Old Testament people
[46:08] have a personal sphere what do you think
[46:12] they're believing was we can go down to
[46:16] a lot of it in by the house and in
[46:18] condemning all of this I want because of
[46:20] his faith so it wasn't based upon how
[46:27] good Abraham was or how good a nut was
[46:30] or how good nor was or any of these it's
[46:37] based upon what God said now maybe we're
[46:45] going over to Paul and quote and get
[46:46] into Romans or not who's gonna condemn
[46:53] Abraham when God said it all right who's
[47:01] gonna say Abraham was guilty this doubt
[47:03] of the other some guys tried it with
[47:05] with Noah I mean I know what job guys
[47:09] tried with job to condemn him and he
[47:12] said listen I've done what God say
[47:16] there's a record down with a high priest
[47:18] that I offered my offerings so why are
[47:21] you guys sitting here condemning me of
[47:23] being a sinner when I'd done exactly and
[47:27] see that the point you that Joe would be
[47:30] getting to him say have you ever done
[47:33] wrong what was her name the guys you
[47:35] remember and don't get the last one
[47:37] because that Elihu Elihu tops Christ so
[47:40] leave him kind of out of that until you
[47:42] can understand the other guys that were
[47:44] talking to Joe
[47:45] we couldn't joke look at them and say do
[47:49] you do anything wrong
[47:51] well yes Joe by did
[47:54] well what you do you know what did you
[47:58] do take care I made the sacrifice joke
[48:05] said well why you condemning me because
[48:07] you got a record I made my sacrifice you
[48:09] understand but they didn't want to
[48:12] believe they still thought he was a
[48:14] secret center my God why would God be
[48:18] putting these things upon you if you
[48:20] hadn't done something secretly your
[48:22] secret sinner job he said I'm just
[48:26] telling you what I've done and I'm
[48:28] telling you what God says and so now
[48:33] we're right back where we started
[48:34] it's based upon what God says to you
[48:38] salvation is based upon what God says to
[48:42] you instead of what God says about you
[48:49] through somebody else okay now listen so
[48:55] then if you're gonna come to God go into
[49:02] what we just read Hebrews if you're
[49:06] gonna come to God you've got to do what
[49:12] for he that cometh to God must believe
[49:16] that God is and then he's a rewarder of
[49:24] them that diligently seek him to
[49:28] anything and whatsoever is based upon
[49:30] your salvation the Old Testament was
[49:32] based upon believing that God spoke to
[49:36] you he's not a hard thing just believe
[49:46] God neck alone you see what is the
[49:51] problem don't remember what the property
[49:53] he said he said I believe maybe that
[49:54] would be you know I could tell you about
[49:56] that but said what if it was not right
[49:59] he said then the next time you come and
[50:01] ask me
[50:04] you're serious right no matter what you
[50:09] can be well blessed and have a lot of
[50:11] them are knowing things and all kind of
[50:13] things and just remember one thing it
[50:19] was never the anointing in the Old
[50:20] Testament it was the offering of the
[50:23] sacrifice so now we're we're gonna put
[50:27] it in the New Testament right now you
[50:31] follow me salvation whatever it's based
[50:35] upon back tyre is still based upon the
[50:38] same thing now and it's the believing
[50:43] that God has spoke to you and told you
[50:47] what to do and you've done it right come
[50:55] on let's go to the next one let's jump
[50:57] to the New Testament pick up the
[50:58] scripture go to number 2
[51:01] Romans he's describing the righteousness
[51:05] of the law as a man which dudes those
[51:07] things you little bomb in sight but the
[51:10] righteousness of faith speaketh on this
[51:11] wise say not in thine heart who shall
[51:14] ascend into heaven that is to bring
[51:16] Christ down from above don't don't try
[51:18] to figure out how to get him down to
[51:20] where yeah or get him up to where yeah
[51:22] just say what he says believe it okay
[51:25] or who she'll descend into the deep that
[51:27] is to bring up Christ again from the
[51:29] dead but what saith it the word is nigh
[51:32] thee even in thy mouth in that heart
[51:36] that is the Word of Faith which we
[51:40] preach no how are you gonna get faith
[51:43] how are you gonna get anything no look
[51:46] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[51:48] mouth the Lord Jesus that's where
[51:52] everybody puts I've confessed I've done
[51:54] this I've confessed but that ain't no
[51:56] hole what God's saying and she'll
[51:58] believe in thine heart that God has
[52:01] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[52:03] saved
[52:03] for with the heart man believeth unto
[52:06] righteousness and with the mouth
[52:08] confession is made unto salvation and
[52:14] then what's your old testament salvation
[52:16] i believing in your heart that god has
[52:21] spoken to you and confessing it with
[52:25] your mouth and don't make no difference
[52:31] what anybody else says about it right it
[52:39] don't make no difference what anybody
[52:41] else says if you believe in what God
[52:44] says to you but now remember we make
[52:52] sure we get everything straight with the
[52:53] line okay
[52:54] God's not gonna speak something to you
[52:57] contrary to the word he's not gonna tell
[53:03] you it's all right to drink and saying
[53:06] the law that's wrong to drink now he's
[53:08] not gonna do it right he will speak
[53:13] according to the law and keep it lined
[53:17] up with that now why because it's faith
[53:25] are believing now I'm trying to make it
[53:30] as simple as the thought could be made
[53:32] that salvation is based upon whether or
[53:38] not number one
[53:41] you can believe that God is you know
[53:45] he's real you got to believe that first
[53:50] and then believe that he's speaking to
[53:54] you not to somebody else it's so close
[54:01] to I remember when a prophet would come
[54:03] out and say thus saith the Lord you
[54:05] realize what they're saying and they
[54:08] just say if Jonah that ain't just the
[54:10] end job that's just say if the Lord
[54:12] through them thus saith the Lord means
[54:15] the Lord speaking through you all right
[54:17] that's why it won't save you there's
[54:22] somebody else saying something probably
[54:27] you know wouldn't you like to hear a
[54:31] voice from heaven say that you're saved
[54:37] when you love to believe that all is
[54:41] gone and your life is pure and settled
[54:45] in Christ true that would be wonderful
[54:52] wouldn't it but what if the voice
[54:55] continues and says now going live like
[54:57] the devil cuz everything's alright now
[55:02] there's something wrong with something
[55:03] talking to you is that a simple of
[55:07] salvation we can get it simply believe
[55:14] it
[55:17] Cain believed that he had to make an
[55:22] atonement but why didn't he go with the
[55:27] blood when surely his mom and dad
[55:29] explained to him about the blood in the
[55:32] beginning and what happened there's no
[55:36] record at Adam and Eve offered
[55:37] sacrifices but I like to say it this way
[55:40] there's no record they didn't okay in
[55:44] other words we got it 50/50 right then
[55:50] won't do nobody no good we worried about
[55:54] where Adam and Eve offer a sacrifice we
[55:57] know God made one for him but you know
[56:03] he didn't make one for at for Cain and
[56:05] Abel oh now you had some a little
[56:12] different time now that let's go all the
[56:17] way back to where we're still in the
[56:19] message right that God didn't curse Adam
[56:23] and God didn't curse Eve cuz how could
[56:27] he curse him if they had eternal life
[56:30] okay
[56:32] the Cain and Abel come forth without
[56:34] eternal life so God made the atonement
[56:37] for Adam and Eve
[56:39] did you get it why because in Adam and
[56:43] Eve was eternal life the Cain and Abel
[56:45] had to make her a home but they still
[56:48] they knew to make it
[56:49] and why would Cain and not knowing all
[56:52] he knew about surely by the end of what
[56:56] took place why would he not offer blood
[57:05] because he was still trying to work his
[57:07] way to heaven that won't work but Abel
[57:11] knew it was blood
[57:15] come on folks get the story listen to
[57:18] what I'm talking about
[57:19] you know Cain and Abel had asked their
[57:21] momma and daddy and their mom and daddy
[57:23] surely through life somewhere had
[57:24] explained the situation to the garden
[57:27] well I don't know where they don't know
[57:31] we just don't know and forget it
[57:34] I'm just trying to make a point the
[57:38] point is one time they had a long time
[57:41] to know about an offering and when they
[57:44] made an offering
[57:45] how come can come out of it with fruits
[57:51] they won't glory but Abel he coming up
[57:54] seeing it with the blood amen
[57:57] you don't think Cain knew it was blood
[58:00] you think Cain did Eve explain the Cain
[58:04] maybe it was thick leaves cuz that first
[58:11] thing she done and Adam with her if they
[58:17] did explain it was big leaves then you
[58:19] can see the cat that Abel got a
[58:21] revelation straight from God that's the
[58:25] point of what I'm trying to make the
[58:28] point I'm trying to make is one time do
[58:31] you believe that God has spoken to you
[58:40] do you believe he's spoken to you in
[58:41] your salvation hurry depending upon what
[58:46] somebody else said come on then
[58:55] what are we getting what was salvation
[58:59] to them the fact that they believed God
[59:10] brother that's just that's too simple
[59:15] too simple we've got a house something
[59:19] give us ooh is that what they said over
[59:22] in the mount Sonny I come on Reggie
[59:28] Bible they said Moses you go up and
[59:32] whatever he tells you we all do see that
[59:39] ways way brother random knew that they
[59:42] were the ones asking for it we think
[59:44] God's full intentions was to give it to
[59:48] him mm-hmm they asked for it and got it
[59:56] that's where I killed him what about it
[59:59] do you believe that God has personally
[1:00:03] spoken to you in your heart now remember
[1:00:09] my point a moment ago he can't speak to
[1:00:13] you anything contrary to the word and it
[1:00:20] be God right he can't tell you it's all
[1:00:27] right to do something when he's already
[1:00:29] said in the word don't do it right
[1:00:35] because that's putting it on something
[1:00:37] else you're taking what Satan is coming
[1:00:39] through your mind then into your being
[1:00:43] all right so then what is salvation of
[1:00:47] the okhta deliverance for whatever they
[1:00:49] had need of what it was for the time
[1:00:53] we're in Israel out of Egypt where it
[1:00:56] was the children out of the fiery
[1:00:57] furnace whether it was you know whatever
[1:01:01] it was it's deliverance all right and
[1:01:04] that spoke of the salvation of mankind
[1:01:07] so that was natural things but mankind
[1:01:16] he's wanting a savior so God told him go
[1:01:28] offer the lamb right who offer the lamb
[1:01:37] as I said be real careful how you handle
[1:01:41] a lot of things because remember the way
[1:01:43] Balaam got ahold of God with how by
[1:01:49] making the seven Rams just like Elijah
[1:01:54] and them did so remember we're coming
[1:01:57] back to one time it's based on faith in
[1:02:01] God it's based on whether you can
[1:02:05] believe God or not yeah but I think
[1:02:11] there's just a little bit of works in
[1:02:12] that now where'd you get that if you
[1:02:16] couldn't get it from the Bible and you
[1:02:18] didn't get it from the Prophet so you
[1:02:19] got it from the devil I don't like that
[1:02:23] brother deal cuz you don't leave me
[1:02:25] anything you don't leave me any hopes my
[1:02:31] hopes has always been build on it I
[1:02:33] didn't do this and I didn't do that then
[1:02:42] we'll get to it'll get a more into the
[1:02:43] law and talk about it I see Church
[1:02:50] the only way you can be saved is what
[1:02:55] Old Testament New Testament which where
[1:02:58] it is now the only way you can be saved
[1:03:00] as what by revelation from God
[1:03:07] Abell it was revealed unto him right
[1:03:18] Moses it was revealed unto him code he
[1:03:21] met the burning bush he knew a lot about
[1:03:25] him didn't he
[1:03:27] his mama taught him a lot about God and
[1:03:31] his ways and you remember the story the
[1:03:33] Prophet would give you that Moses you
[1:03:36] know because of all of that he knew
[1:03:38] about God he could say he had a personal
[1:03:41] experience but when he come to the
[1:03:46] burning bush he found out his experience
[1:03:51] wasn't good enough his experience was
[1:03:54] the fact of believing the God came on
[1:03:57] the scene to him and and he could
[1:04:02] believe how about it
[1:04:05] is your revelation based upon salvation
[1:04:09] I mean salvation upon a revelation
[1:04:11] because the Prophet says you can only be
[1:04:13] this is Patmos vision you can only be
[1:04:17] known by revelation and you can only be
[1:04:21] saved by revelation did you have a
[1:04:26] knowledge of it intellectually but you
[1:04:29] can't be saved until it's revealed to
[1:04:32] you
[1:04:33] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:04:36] the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible
[1:04:41] says no man can say Jesus is Christ
[1:04:42] until he has received the Holy Ghost
[1:04:48] now you remember brother Brown said you
[1:04:50] stop a drunk going down the highway and
[1:04:52] said he can say Jesus is the Christ
[1:04:55] business is not words you don't get
[1:05:00] nothing out of the whole message you get
[1:05:01] one time of what I'm trying to bring
[1:05:03] it's just not acts of the fact of me you
[1:05:06] know people trying to believe this
[1:05:07] without or the other it's when God began
[1:05:11] to speak to my end they believed he was
[1:05:13] speaking to them that's my whole point
[1:05:18] if you don't believe God is speaking to
[1:05:20] you well the one good is it and if you
[1:05:24] back down wouldn't you believe that God
[1:05:27] is speaking to you and when he spoke to
[1:05:35] them back there he wasn't telling him a
[1:05:38] book of rules to keep come on he was
[1:05:45] telling them to go back to your
[1:05:46] totalement go off for the lam if you
[1:05:56] want salvation so it's not recorded as
[1:06:03] to point a lot of times that the people
[1:06:07] making atonement right I mean you you
[1:06:11] read a whole chapter and you don't see a
[1:06:13] thing about them making offerings or
[1:06:15] anything but then when you see a
[1:06:17] situation come up that they really
[1:06:19] needed deliverance or whatever for that
[1:06:21] point you can see that situation
[1:06:23] existing you see them making an
[1:06:25] atonement hurry right you remember when
[1:06:34] Moses told Aaron go along the people get
[1:06:39] that sense forgets that Cole's right off
[1:06:41] the altar go among the people says pre
[1:06:44] adventure you make an atonement but see
[1:06:49] it was based upon what they believe now
[1:06:51] that's the whole point I can read all of
[1:06:53] this about revelation he must be
[1:06:56] revealed to you personally that
[1:06:59] salvation that God revealed himself to
[1:07:02] you personally abraham believed God and
[1:07:06] it was counted a reckoning to him Moses
[1:07:09] believed God now you know but it's not
[1:07:17] listed that God spoke to everybody like
[1:07:20] them so we got to make it more a little
[1:07:24] more simple we've got to get it to the
[1:07:28] basis that we
[1:07:30] find out maybe that all right they seen
[1:07:37] it work for Moses and they they believe
[1:07:40] God was speaking to them and they'd go
[1:07:43] make an atonement I've always believed
[1:07:46] it I believe this in a Baptist Church I
[1:07:47] can remember sitting reading the Word of
[1:07:49] God and thinking about those Old
[1:07:51] Testament Saints as they offered the
[1:07:54] sacrifices you know and that's all God
[1:08:00] you mean everybody they walked up and
[1:08:03] laid down a lamb no sincerity they just
[1:08:09] flop it down and they walked back
[1:08:10] forgiven mrs. Lord I don't see that
[1:08:17] because you said you didn't look at man
[1:08:19] like that you looked at it honest in a
[1:08:23] sincere heart you said she has even fed
[1:08:28] up with their offerings and sacrifices
[1:08:30] and they become a speak in your nostrils
[1:08:33] so everybody come to everybody that went
[1:08:36] up lay the land that wasn't forgiven oh
[1:08:38] they might have had the record swept
[1:08:41] away
[1:08:42] you know remember cuz they kept a record
[1:08:44] of what you done and then they cleaned
[1:08:46] the records they might have got all the
[1:08:48] things done but that didn't put it
[1:08:51] between you and God
[1:08:57] what is a true believer
[1:09:00] what is a true believer scripturally
[1:09:03] speaking no matter where you're at what
[1:09:05] is it a true believer
[1:09:06] it's a person that can believe that God
[1:09:11] is and that he will keep his word today
[1:09:20] as much as he ever kept it if he just
[1:09:24] believed you she didn't alive leaving is
[1:09:30] based upon you and I and especially it
[1:09:33] was back dark they thought about girl
[1:09:35] life live save them but it wasn't that
[1:09:38] it was the atonement that was being made
[1:09:40] pushing that to Calvary pushing it
[1:09:42] pushing it pushing
[1:09:45] and knowing that Jesus Christ would come
[1:09:47] to make the salvation complete so then
[1:09:51] it wasn't any new birth and the Old
[1:09:55] Testament there wasn't a giving of
[1:10:00] eternal life in the Old Testament but it
[1:10:09] was pushing it forward to Christ making
[1:10:15] an atonement a covering or deliverance
[1:10:17] that's why I'm using that word
[1:10:19] it was the salvation what was salvation
[1:10:22] in the Old Testament believing God had
[1:10:26] spoken to you and you offered a blood
[1:10:31] atonement because of what I'm saying to
[1:10:36] you and you accepting that as the fact
[1:10:41] that God had personally spoken to you a
[1:10:48] lot of the contacts that are made in the
[1:10:51] Old Testament was made in the basis of
[1:10:56] not nice to say salvation it was a
[1:10:58] saying of a deliverance for some reason
[1:11:01] Moses with the burning bush to tell him
[1:11:03] about the point of of delivering the
[1:11:08] children of Israel but don't you think
[1:11:13] he sit back I turn on the backside of
[1:11:15] that desert and he sat down there and he
[1:11:19] thought mama spent all of her life I
[1:11:24] know you you watch the ten commandments
[1:11:27] they don't come out the way the Bible
[1:11:29] declares okay
[1:11:37] one time brother Brennan will talk about
[1:11:40] 17 years old 16 years old the time he
[1:11:43] talking about it when his mom was need
[1:11:45] his difference justice dollars but she
[1:11:51] told him said you're not the son of
[1:11:54] Pharaoh you're a Jew he looked at that
[1:12:02] and he thought I'm gonna deliver so I
[1:12:08] said you you look the 10 commandments
[1:12:10] and I enjoy that's a good movie but
[1:12:12] these radish groups are the ones I've
[1:12:14] ever seen but it still kind of missed
[1:12:17] that line there because it waited to
[1:12:19] leave was about 45 years old or some
[1:12:21] worries over doing and doing all he do
[1:12:23] and then all at once you'll find out
[1:12:24] he's a Jew and he gets into trouble well
[1:12:27] that's not exactly the way brought
[1:12:28] around him described it so we take what
[1:12:30] he said so he knew all of his life why
[1:12:36] do you think he trained remember he
[1:12:41] could teach the Egyptians he trained he
[1:12:46] was getting ready to be a deliverer cuz
[1:12:51] he believed that's what he's father
[1:12:53] remember what the Prophet said all that
[1:12:56] mama told him was not enough cuz that
[1:13:03] was somebody else that was good
[1:13:06] he knew use a deliverer he believed he
[1:13:09] was a deliverer but he when he wound up
[1:13:13] with a stinking dead Egyptian he got
[1:13:15] scared and run but when he met God at
[1:13:23] the burning bush he had something
[1:13:24] personal he wasn't afraid afraid row he
[1:13:28] wasn't afraid of none of those times he
[1:13:30] just said okay what's her name Zipporah
[1:13:32] they said get two young uns ready
[1:13:34] and let's go where we're going we're
[1:13:37] going to eat you what we're gonna do in
[1:13:40] Egypt we're going on takeover oh heck
[1:13:44] over are you gonna go up to Pharaoh and
[1:13:48] declare that if you know the old
[1:13:51] daddy now nan said Oh daddy was already
[1:13:53] gone the wonder what his name was that
[1:13:55] you know they really love Moses he's
[1:14:02] already gone he said we're going down
[1:14:05] there to take over we're gonna have a
[1:14:10] salvation that God said was going to
[1:14:15] take place and God has come to us and
[1:14:19] you know what I'm talking about
[1:14:21] they preached that Sunday after Sunday
[1:14:25] after Sunday right cowboy sir ever what
[1:14:29] you want to call him when they had
[1:14:30] services they preached a coming
[1:14:33] deliverer we're going to be delivered
[1:14:39] and Moses sit and listen and he says
[1:14:44] mama is that what you're talking about
[1:14:50] you've born for that son with that
[1:14:54] wouldn't enough but when he got
[1:14:58] something personal into burning bush he
[1:15:02] was never afraid of the Egyptians no
[1:15:04] more I think about that I remember in
[1:15:07] the Baptist Church I used to read really
[1:15:09] I think about those sign I was thinking
[1:15:11] you know I mean you go off you turn and
[1:15:14] go front right what's wrong you go for
[1:15:16] until Toronto I'm gonna take over and he
[1:15:19] tweets sitting there's a couple of guys
[1:15:20] come get you and you've gone you know us
[1:15:22] our highs we don't care ain't none of
[1:15:25] our business but just think of Moses
[1:15:27] walking up to the Pharaoh of Egypt I
[1:15:40] mean all there to do get rid of him
[1:15:45] evidently he must have remembered Moses
[1:15:50] and evidently he must have remembered I
[1:15:53] know the story - cause Moses talked
[1:15:56] about it when we're little always
[1:15:58] playing he thought he was a deliverer
[1:16:02] and said I've got to leave that oh boy
[1:16:04] alone because he's gonna cause an
[1:16:06] insurrection now you tell me think
[1:16:08] something sensible like that happened
[1:16:09] he's gonna cause an insurrection among
[1:16:11] these people so I'd better be careful
[1:16:13] with this old boy come on you're talking
[1:16:17] to the fire road they said come a
[1:16:20] million and they kill him the Moses
[1:16:25] never had no fear I'll surely turn
[1:16:31] racing Lord now what I do now they're
[1:16:33] not doing it they're not obeying you but
[1:16:34] what I do now he said okay you do this
[1:16:37] he go do that and he said Lord now what
[1:16:40] I do sure come on he was a human but he
[1:16:44] still didn't run well cuz he had
[1:16:50] something personal come on is this it he
[1:16:53] had something personal
[1:16:56] he had an experience of salvation now
[1:17:01] listen do you think maybe this could be
[1:17:04] a point that Moses was thinking when our
[1:17:07] Lord you delivered me and I believe you
[1:17:13] can deliver the him and if I if I am the
[1:17:17] guy I'm sure he doubted he wondered if
[1:17:23] I'm the guy to deliver then Lord it's
[1:17:25] left up to you I'm gonna just walk out
[1:17:31] there you remember they told that to
[1:17:33] brother Branham in the beginning don't
[1:17:35] leave don't do this don't do that he
[1:17:37] said but God called me I've got to go
[1:17:44] see when the deliverer speaks to you you
[1:17:46] have no fear like I've always said you
[1:17:53] think about it God went down and
[1:17:57] anointed David through the Prophet
[1:17:59] learnt he anointed him to be king you
[1:18:00] think David was afraid of ten glass or
[1:18:03] any kind of glass now he knew one thing
[1:18:06] for certain he wasn't gonna die until he
[1:18:09] sat on the throne because the Prophet
[1:18:12] didn't say how long we gonna live after
[1:18:14] you get there
[1:18:15] just told him said you're the man David
[1:18:18] and you're going to sit on the throne he
[1:18:21] had no worries once he got on the throne
[1:18:24] he's probably started wondering what's
[1:18:27] gonna take place now but until then
[1:18:29] there's a whole settled because God said
[1:18:36] it what salvation based on old our new
[1:18:40] God said it again we believe and we
[1:18:48] believe it's for us remember that was
[1:18:52] one of the conditions I read it to you
[1:18:55] was to believe that God was speaking to
[1:18:58] you hell no doubt less than what we got
[1:19:07] salvation is on the Lord
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:16] it's later than you see anybody have an
[1:19:19] ad altered hoping the bride is prepare
[1:19:25] for me

[1:20:04] believe the words are gone father we lay
[1:20:08] our hands upon these prayer clothes
[1:20:09] believe in you that whatever the need
[1:20:12] that would take place and the person
[1:20:14] receiving these that they'd receive it
[1:20:17] from you lord they'd believe it and
[1:20:20] deliverance would be their salvation for
[1:20:23] whatever healing of the body or
[1:20:25] salvation for soul whatever it be it
[1:20:28] would be there we thank you and we
[1:20:31] committed to you Lord and believe in you
[1:20:34] in Jesus name

[1:21:18] just pray that you would Lord speak to
[1:21:21] each one of our hearts and tell us about
[1:21:22] your salvation because it truly is
[1:21:25] deliverance whatever we have need of it
[1:21:29] delivered the people back down that
[1:21:32] delivers now so we pray that you would
[1:21:35] just God and bless each one but maybe we
[1:21:38] will remember that the salvation is
[1:21:40] solely based upon you speaking to us not
[1:21:43] something we could do or any thoughts
[1:21:45] would be based on you speaking to us and
[1:21:49] us believing it and we thank you in
[1:21:52] Jesus you're dismissed
