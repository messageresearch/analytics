[0:00] over in South Carolina I'll not call his
[0:03] name but he's preaching on the statute
[0:05] of perfect man also from birth to
[0:08] adoption is what he called it from
[0:10] birth to adoption okay so he's been
[0:13] going and he really rejoiced in in that
[0:15] uh in that point that we've been doing
[0:17] the same thing and I didn't know this
[0:20] but brother Lis said he went back and
[0:21] tried to find out when I started and he
[0:23] thought it was last year it was February
[0:25] 2013 is actually when we first started
[0:27] on the statute of First Command that's
[0:29] been almost two years this coming
[0:30] February be two years so well you take
[0:33] 60 something this is number 67 so yeah
[0:38] that's a good bit anyway just we need to
[0:41] just trust the Lord and don't pause it
[0:44] turn it on thank you just trust the Lord
[0:47] that he will uh he'll make this thing
[0:52] live CU it's a requirement right
[0:57] right and it's refreshing to see
[1:00] and it's like the brother said and he he
[1:02] made a wonderful point he said I believe
[1:04] this is the centerpiece of the message
[1:07] yeah and I believe that this is the
[1:09] centerpiece of the
[1:11] message cuz it is the
[1:14] foundation of all the message all them
[1:16] 100 sermons it is the foundation cuz you
[1:19] have to start with the foundation stone
[1:21] to get this one here and it's like he
[1:23] said he said he said well I'm glad you
[1:24] took that much time he said because if
[1:26] you don't get the foundation right the
[1:29] building will crack fall
[1:32] warp right but if you got that
[1:35] foundation on real good solid rock real
[1:37] good Revelation then you know what it's
[1:40] a little bit better to go up through
[1:41] these these virtues so let's read right
[1:44] here I think we kind of stopped right
[1:47] here these fellas wasn't required what
[1:48] these fellas are now what he's talking
[1:50] about these
[1:51] fellas these fellas wasn't required they
[1:53] weren't required Luther wasn't required
[1:56] to come to
[1:58] here Luther's m message was the just
[2:00] shall live by faith these fellas wasn't
[2:03] required what these fellas are this
[2:04] wasn't required what this was see but he
[2:08] brought his church up the same way he
[2:09] brought his church up the same way he
[2:11] brings his people up Peter says here
[2:13] first seven things Faith virtue
[2:15] knowledge temper fa God brotherly
[2:17] kindness as brotherly kindness then the
[2:19] love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the
[2:21] person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[2:24] in the true baptism of the Holy
[2:26] Spirit now does anybody need explaining
[2:29] of that I know there's still a confusion
[2:31] in the message when brother brandham
[2:33] says that they think you have to get all
[2:36] the virtues and then you get the Holy
[2:40] Ghost cuz it says the true baptism that
[2:42] doesn't mean you got a false birth down
[2:44] here you got a true birth down here what
[2:47] happens is is the holy spirit can add
[2:49] more to you and has been adding more to
[2:51] you up through the pyramid so it's the
[2:55] Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the
[2:57] Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true
[2:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get
[3:01] all these virtues sealed in you now it
[3:03] doesn't say you get all these virtues
[3:04] see what that one word would
[3:07] do then you get all these and you get
[3:09] all these virtues virtues in
[3:13] you see if you read it read Now read it
[3:16] read it like somebody else would read it
[3:19] holy ghost comes upon you and the
[3:20] baptism of Holy Ghost and you get all
[3:21] these virtues in you that seems to me
[3:24] like you got to come here before these
[3:25] virtues come in you but he put sealed in
[3:28] you they are you got to be in there
[3:30] before they're sealed right G not the
[3:33] holy spirit of God were you're sealed
[3:35] till the day of your Redemption you
[3:36] don't seal a truck when it's empty yes
[3:38] sir we would fill a truck full of
[3:40] chicken and we'd shut the doors and we'd
[3:42] seal it so something it was already full
[3:44] of something okay so it was full of
[3:46] virtue and all the temp place god
[3:48] brother kind and it seals you Holy Ghost
[3:51] comes upon you that's right because you
[3:53] already having in that's right it comes
[3:55] upon you it's it is another anointing
[3:58] it's an anointing that is different from
[4:00] your new birth your new
[4:03] birth makes you a spirit bab in Christ
[4:06] this does not this he said then God
[4:09] lives in a tabernacle called the
[4:11] building the living Tabernacle of the
[4:12] living God's Dwelling Place when a man
[4:15] possesses these kind of things then the
[4:18] Holy Ghost comes upon him that's right
[4:21] no matter you might speak with tongues
[4:23] you might impersonating any gift that
[4:24] God's Got You might do that but until
[4:26] these virtues here go into you you're
[4:30] still off the real true foundation of
[4:32] Faith but when these virtues grow in and
[4:36] you add that to that then you are a
[4:39] living Monument you're a living
[4:42] moving
[4:44] Idol and then he talks about the you
[4:47] know people
[4:48] the imaginary
[4:51] gods and that's what they have romanism
[4:54] see that that's
[4:55] romanism but when we not I like this one
[4:58] right here but when we not in an
[5:00] imaginary way so there's no imagination
[5:02] to this all right but when we not in an
[5:05] imaginary way but prostrate ourself
[5:07] before a living God a living virtue
[5:10] living knowledge living patience living
[5:11] godliness living power coming from a
[5:13] living God makes a living man a Living
[5:16] Image in the stature of God what's he
[5:18] doing the same things that Jesus did
[5:21] walking the same way he walked doing the
[5:23] same things he did because it's not
[5:25] imaginary thing there's a
[5:28] reality that proves it is what is the
[5:31] reality the way you live your life the
[5:34] things you do when we get finished with
[5:37] this you ought to know exactly where you
[5:39] are in this pyramid that's right you
[5:42] ought to know exactly where you are in
[5:44] this pyramid and then you need to start
[5:46] working on it cuz see I can't give it to
[5:48] you I can make it available and I can
[5:51] make the way open for you to get there
[5:53] but you got to go out there by yourself
[5:55] it's an individual affair with
[5:58] God first thing thing you got to do
[6:00] though is you got to get under a
[6:01] teaching that actually teaches that okay
[6:04] cuz cuz most don't and I was talking to
[6:06] that brother too when he was I said
[6:08] brother I said I I if you say it's a
[6:10] centerpiece I said I won't hear anybody
[6:12] preach me he said no brother they
[6:14] don't but he told me he said he said I
[6:17] know they're a requirement he said I'm
[6:19] trying to teach my people that it is a
[6:23] requirement see what I mean see how
[6:25] these virtues these Building Material
[6:27] types in the church age Messengers with
[6:28] the church ages and one of these days
[6:30] we're going to take each one of these
[6:31] words which he did now that is the house
[6:34] that God dwells in not a building with a
[6:36] big belt but a body has thou prepared me
[6:39] body that God can dwell in walk in see
[6:42] in talk in work in living
[6:45] instrumentality of God God walking in
[6:48] two on two feet in you glory footsteps
[6:51] of the righteous order of God God
[6:53] walking in you for your a written
[6:55] epistle and if the life that's in Christ
[6:57] be in you you'll bear the life
[7:00] that Christ
[7:03] bore all right let's skip going over a
[7:05] little
[7:08] bit let's read this one right here I
[7:10] like that and now we put the blood of
[7:13] Jesus Christ in see and that brings the
[7:14] faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of
[7:16] Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus
[7:18] Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ
[7:19] the patience of Jesus Christ the
[7:21] godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly
[7:22] kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of
[7:25] God which is Jesus Christ right got it
[7:28] the love of God which is Jesus Christ
[7:31] he's the head and controls you and your
[7:33] feet is the foundation Faith controlled
[7:36] by the head take the there you are there
[7:38] is the perfect man of God when he
[7:41] possesses these
[7:44] virtues then remember God represents his
[7:47] bride as a bride as a person that says
[7:50] my feet moves why because my head says
[7:53] so now it can't move like my hand
[7:55] because it's my feet Luther can't do the
[7:57] things we did neither can Methodist
[7:58] because they were something else the
[8:00] feet moves because the head says so and
[8:02] the head never says now feet you become
[8:04] hand ear you become eyes see that's what
[8:06] our problem is when the message now we
[8:08] got people we we're not in we're not in
[8:09] line brother when we realize who we are
[8:12] well if you're an ear be an
[8:13] ear your finger be a finger if your leg
[8:16] be a leg you
[8:19] know but each age God has placed these
[8:21] things into his church and patterned it
[8:23] by showing that each individual has
[8:25] these possesses these qualities and this
[8:27] being when it's complete is the Church
[8:30] of God going to Rapture and this being
[8:33] and completed is a servant of God and
[8:35] the Church of God is going in Rapture
[8:37] see what I mean there you are there's
[8:39] the full thing here comes Paul he and
[8:42] now he watch he goes through this CU I
[8:43] want you to see how it parallels Church
[8:45] AG here comes the man Paul laying the
[8:47] foundation cuz brother Brown said Paul
[8:50] was the pattern Messenger right pattern
[8:52] messenger Foundation right Paul laying
[8:55] the
[8:56] foundation irus began to pour this into
[8:59] to it the next one poured this the next
[9:00] one poured this next one that that that
[9:02] on down till it comes to the last stage
[9:04] but what is it it's the same
[9:07] Spirit everybody got that it's the same
[9:11] Spirit the whole stature of your being
[9:13] is governed and controlled by these
[9:14] things but it cannot be completely
[9:16] controlled till it completely possesses
[9:18] these qualities you understand
[9:19] that you can't be completely controlled
[9:23] until it completely possesses these
[9:26] qualities in other words you can't you
[9:28] still got the power without
[9:30] character did you ever hear this now let
[9:33] me tell you this keep it real put this
[9:34] in your listening ear a chain is it
[9:37] strongest at its Wist length all right
[9:40] anybody understand that I got a question
[9:44] uhhuh on um
[9:46] 357 now we still have premoral agency
[9:50] whether we are filled with all these
[9:53] virtues right but it's still easier for
[9:56] God to control us at that point well if
[9:59] you come to right here you've lost a lot
[10:01] of your free will okay a lot of it
[10:05] that's right cuz your will becomes his
[10:07] will okay see because Jesus was standing
[10:10] there with the headstone he said not my
[10:12] will but thy will be done okay not my
[10:15] will but thy will be done you got it
[10:16] okay yeah I mean sure you you got free
[10:18] moral agency to stop any of this and and
[10:21] not have all these full virtues like
[10:23] we've been teaching but as you get
[10:25] further and further up what's it doing
[10:28] Mar
[10:31] and even listen even when we're finished
[10:33] with this we're going to get into
[10:34] another part even when you finish with
[10:36] this brother Brown says you
[10:38] still got to
[10:41] take like Michelangelo he finished that
[10:44] statue of Moses but it still looked kind
[10:46] of
[10:47] rough brother Brown said he took and he
[10:49] polished it till it shined then he' go
[10:52] polish the other side till it Shine so
[10:54] see God's you get up to he God still
[10:56] he's got to polish you off that's right
[10:58] cuz even brother you know brother Brown
[11:00] 1963 we believe he become this complete
[11:03] image of God he was still a human being
[11:05] he still had problems he still had
[11:07] things he had to work
[11:08] on but he had lost a lot of his Free
[11:11] Will okay is that what the persecution
[11:13] is going to do probably do some of it
[11:16] yes cuz the bride does better under
[11:19] persecution I mean right
[11:21] now what do we need he so confident like
[11:24] we were talking about what do we
[11:25] need yeah we all got good jobs we all
[11:29] got this we all got that you
[11:32] know as you're going up the statute of
[11:34] perfect man you're obtaining each step
[11:36] as you go up the more you increase that
[11:40] your free will decrease that's correct I
[11:43] believe that I mean that's just the way
[11:44] I believe because you'll always be a
[11:46] free moral agent cuz brother B said this
[11:47] will always be sticky cuz remember your
[11:50] memory reason conscious affection and
[11:52] Imagination God can come through there
[11:54] and so can the devil mm mhm but remember
[11:57] it's Jesus on the inside working on the
[12:02] outside right so he's inside here trying
[12:05] to push that junk out of those flu he's
[12:08] pushing that memory toward him not
[12:11] toward Satan but now listen if you let
[12:13] Satan get in your memory and start
[12:16] playing Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's
[12:18] going okay right I'll go out on the limb
[12:21] and sit here for a minute Prophet said
[12:23] that right he said I'm going out Li he
[12:24] said I'm going to sit here until you and
[12:26] you may go through a beating yeah M you
[12:30] may go through a beating but if you're a
[12:32] son the Holy Ghost will finally
[12:35] go you need to go back out there where
[12:37] you used to be or you need to call me
[12:39] back out if you don't mind I'll come out
[12:40] there and help
[12:42] you but he's a gentleman so he'll not we
[12:45] will be free moral agents till the time
[12:47] of the change that's
[12:49] right that's just because remember I
[12:51] read the quote
[12:53] yesterday I wish I had it with me i'
[12:56] read it cuz he said the animal has no
[12:59] free will because he has no soul the
[13:02] reason you're given a soul is to
[13:06] choose right I got I don't have it on
[13:09] here I got it on my papers at home
[13:11] brother rown said the animal has no
[13:13] choice that's right but you no what he
[13:16] was saying was going to heaven he said
[13:17] the animal has no choice of going to
[13:19] heaven let me get it right the animal
[13:20] has no choice of going to heaven or hell
[13:23] what he said right cuz it's just a
[13:25] nature their their flesh will go back
[13:27] down into the Earth and it's gone
[13:29] there's no soul laying somewhere that's
[13:30] got to make a choice but he said in man
[13:33] he put a soul for one thing only and
[13:36] that's to make a choice give you a free
[13:39] will makes you gives you a Godlike
[13:41] quality when he gives you a soul that
[13:42] gives you a Godlike quality you can
[13:44] either choose to or not
[13:47] to everybody okay with that all
[13:53] right right here no matter how strong
[13:56] these are built up this is built up if
[13:59] he's got a weak link there's where she
[14:00] breaks and it's no stronger than that
[14:03] weakest link now if you possess you say
[14:06] you got this this this you don't have
[14:07] this there's where she breaks if you got
[14:10] this and haven't got that she'll break
[14:11] right there point to the Chart you get
[14:14] this and haven't got that it'll break
[14:16] this and haven't got that it'll break
[14:18] this and haven't got that it'll break
[14:19] and if you ain't can't have this without
[14:21] having this now here he's summing this
[14:24] all up he's summing he's making a
[14:26] summation so when you surrender your
[14:28] compl
[14:29] being then the Holy Spirit just pours
[14:32] through you in these virtues then you're
[14:35] a living Tabernacle then people look at
[14:37] you and say that's a man full of virtue
[14:39] knowledge Temperance patience God
[14:41] brother kindness full of the love of the
[14:43] Holy Ghost see there he is walking
[14:45] around what is it a stature that
[14:47] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[14:50] a Christian there is a man or woman who
[14:53] knows what they're talking
[14:55] about you never see a Kinder sweeter
[14:58] Godly a person you're Seal Seal shows on
[15:01] both sides whether you're going or
[15:03] coming you see what he's saying seal
[15:05] shows forward seal shows back so it's
[15:08] you're coming and you're
[15:12] going and in other words that means if
[15:15] you come into a building and you talk to
[15:17] a group of people and when you walk off
[15:18] they say man that guy ain't no Christian
[15:20] yeah see that's your seal showing on the
[15:22] backside that you're not you may put the
[15:25] front that you are but the you know the
[15:27] opinion of it is no I don't think so a
[15:30] seal shows on both sides whether you're
[15:32] going or coming you see the seal just
[15:34] the same there you are see when a man or
[15:36] woman possesses this then the Capstone
[15:39] comes
[15:40] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[15:43] God which is the Holy Ghost so it's the
[15:47] Holy Ghost here and it's the Holy Ghost
[15:49] here and the Holy Ghost here and the
[15:50] Holy Ghost here same Holy
[15:53] Ghost and I really enjoyed what that
[15:55] brother
[15:56] said he said I can put justification
[15:58] sanctification baptism holy ghost in the
[16:00] pyramid I've never in my life heard that
[16:02] except from this
[16:03] church never have I heard that that he
[16:06] could put justification sanctification
[16:08] baptism the Holy Ghost Inside the
[16:10] pyramid not down here but inside this
[16:13] pyramid and I said brother you're
[16:15] exactly correct so I'm glad that the the
[16:19] Lord is dealing with people that has a
[16:21] good heart that brother I believe got a
[16:23] real good
[16:26] heart then the word coming from him
[16:29] here manifest itself through each of
[16:32] these things beings see and makes this
[16:35] complete being a tabernacle of the
[16:38] Living God a walking living example of
[16:41] Christianity what Christ was these
[16:42] people are cuz his life is in here they
[16:45] are in Christ and their life is dead and
[16:47] hid in Christ through God and sealed in
[16:49] there by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12
[16:52] see you reckon yourself dead then you're
[16:55] born of Faith see there they starts you
[16:58] you reckon yourself dead then you're
[16:59] born of faith not a here you're born of
[17:02] Faith so he puts it in the right place
[17:05] see that then virtue and these other
[17:08] things is added if any people would just
[17:10] read the book that thinks you get the
[17:11] Holy Ghost up here he never explains
[17:13] that you get the Holy Ghost up here
[17:15] right you get the Holy Ghost at Faith
[17:17] all
[17:18] right then virtue and these other things
[17:20] is added to you till you're a perfect
[17:23] living image of God that wonderful
[17:26] congregation says amen and then God
[17:28] through that has brought us seven Church
[17:30] ages to show the seven steps that he
[17:32] brought building his individual Into His
[17:34] Image he's built a complete Church in
[17:36] His image at the resurrection this
[17:38] complete body will be raised up to live
[17:40] with him forever because it's a bride so
[17:43] that cuts in every age every age that
[17:47] come and there's more required remember
[17:49] remember what Paul said in Hebrews
[17:52] 11 he he reads Hebrews 11 like what
[17:54] dad's been reading the whole thing all
[17:55] the way down through through here
[17:59] but watch him he gets to
[18:00] the do
[18:04] that what paragraph Was I on right
[18:08] there he reads Hebrews
[18:12] 11 but he some his summation is in
[18:15] paragraph 366 just like he see he said
[18:18] here brother refers to the drawing good
[18:19] report through faith receive not the
[18:21] promise God having provided some better
[18:23] thing for us that they without us should
[18:25] not be made perfect you get it these
[18:28] people who died in
[18:30] here are depending and waiting on us so
[18:35] this church I believe he's pointing
[18:37] right here has to come to Perfection
[18:38] that's us right the loudest we're the
[18:41] only one that's alive that's right all
[18:43] right this church has to come to
[18:46] perfection in order to bring the
[18:48] resurrection and there under Souls under
[18:51] the altar waiting for this church to
[18:52] come to its
[18:54] Perfection that when Christ does come
[18:57] and this church you see is coming
[18:59] smaller in the minority refers to the
[19:00] Chart board I think he's referring to
[19:02] this look a lot of people in the first
[19:04] St coming down down down down down all
[19:06] the way to the razor's Edge it's a whole
[19:09] lot sharper than that but just like to
