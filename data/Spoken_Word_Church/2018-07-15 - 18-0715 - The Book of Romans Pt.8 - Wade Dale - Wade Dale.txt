========================================

I'm gonna read it out of them read it out of the textbook we've gone away over though I need to be alone here okay alrighty then I need to be back yeah good to be everybody's back now and we've got everybody over all the flavors are back home now they've been gone when all-star break now all started back so we got a got everybody together no thank you for holding it together while I was gone Bob and the rest of you don't Joe and Glen don't know okay all right let's go rolling for now remember we were talking about we've been in this study of Romans when circumcision in uncircumcision we know we do know for a fact that that doesn't mean anything of your spirituality or anything the the natural form of circle T okay is no bearing at all it was your mom and daddys fault if you would and out same way will they you know they your mama days you guys through the menu circumcised so it really doesn't matter it's the circumcision of the heart we know that it's the excess flesh that we live in something needs to be trimmed right the excess flesh that we live in what needs to be trimmed night and it's not the natural flesh you know it's all spiritual because why is this in Romans 4 we see that now now listen to you make it all sound good or to make it all in continuity back in the Old Testament there could be no circumcision of the heart because Jesus had done there was no Holy Ghost we go inside the person to cut them to cut the foreskin of your flesh and then so god I stand by this because I'm you know we're getting ready to go into the fifth seal and you see that God is a just God he's so just that he gives a group of people eternal life that didn't even want it he blinded their eyes so that we could come in so he had to be just and give them eternal life he had to do that or he would be a respective person they said well I just used you to get to you know the Gentile bride know which he did he blinded them purposely but he said I won't ever forgive them because in the Old Testament good for we see this set over they for him cannot forget a for him I cannot forget Moses cannot forget all these people in the Old Testament because you know what they lived a godly life without the Holy Ghost in their soul now the out of the morning and the anointing will come on they can be biblical people this is well like that you could they could be biblical people with the anointing on but they were just too common regular person when out anointing came off of it Moses could kill an Egyptian David could have relations with a woman named when supposed to write that was the human part but yet David could go into the not even to live here a court of the temple but he could go in the tech once I am circumcised dude so I'm okay and talking to one God got honor that he said okay I can't go any further now monitor what what you've done what do you done though he did an honor even honor Abraham circumcised in themself so much is that he honored Abraham's faith in what God said he honored his faith because watch you chapter four I'm going to read about eight verses and then I'm gonna read it in the in the die Glocke because man the die Glocke really in this part of this scripture brings out a lot to to make it more where you can understand what's going on so romans chapter 4 now if you've got a Scofield Bible it says this is justification by faith Illustrated which it is now see we're still in the seals we're still in justa me any time I hear the word justification I'm in the first seal okay I'm in the first seal because that's the seal to me that's the sealing justifications right right sang it seals a sylph sanctification third seal the seal of the Holy Ghost why go on and then the fourth seal is what God incarnate in human flesh Satan incarnate in human flesh that's what we're going to start with seal number four then seal number five is what grace the greatest grace you can have his dog give eternal life to somebody didn't want same way with us he gave me eternal life does we don't want it we didn't we were boring contrary okay all right so now let's look at this romans chapter 4 why I say once we see to me to me the thunders of once you got on the seal break and it's the seal that on this it's the seal on this scripture is what we need broke I kissed the still over our eyes the Satanists put out we're gonna we're gonna study this in the in this force field a lot in this force field that Satan blinded people's eyes by the billions all they'll do the church ages he blinded their eyes now God winked two thicknesses so they tried to believe they have faith and you can't go past the fake Nazi to see how faith have faith in me alright so we're going to see that though as see the seals progressed up further cuz remember in this fourth seal that's coming to up man it's a lot to go on save this destroyed the Dragons cast out of Satan's cast out of heaven the the Red Dragons test out this guy goes to Israel you and I become guard incarnate Staton is destroyed in our flesh so man at four steals pretty child because they are after taking place on the four seals so we're gone so everything's got a culminated in that for sale same way we'll safe everything's got a culminated in that fourth seal for him also well I seen Abraham though here we see that Abraham the faith of Abraham it wasn't even Hamill circumcised that was a outward sign just like you and I are baptized just like you and I are aware that what we wear and week we try our best at being different we don't want to be different we don't ever walk out in the world say I'm better than you right cause I don't cut my hair no wrong attitude it's just that I was thinking the other day though though let me tell you this sounds country though we are special group of people though we are a step aside group of people just like Israel that's why people hate Israel now because I said whoever blesses Israel I'll bless whoever curses Israel I'll curse and that still goes on today brother rod said already yesterday that the reason that God is not bringing judgment on the United States is because they are a friend of Israel and whoever is a friend of Israel the friend of died being that we have prostitutes on every corner that doesn't matter God said if you'll be good to Israel but now you see us now and the last administration and then this one they're turning well you know come trying to get back over there but anyway it was that separation of well we'll just let them alone and do what they want to do you know and you see how it's going to happen cuz we're going to turn away from Israel I'm guarantee because everybody is and everybody's gonna turn away what's God gonna do he's gonna send two prophets over there the world ain't never seen him before and they want to watch them do miracles like you never saw miracles number for me you and I are not gonna be there to see it we're gonna be out of here because of this faith that we have in the Word of God all right let's get started what shall we say to Romans chapter 4 like I said my iPad crash so we're gonna have to do it the old-fashioned way don't need I put better than hearing it still running no the only the only owner out buttons when you open it what shall we say then now remember we've been how my sermons even uncertainty what shall we save them that Abraham our Father has pertaining to the flag how family cuz remember Abraham according to the flesh has nothing to do with us we are not a descendant of Abraham but we are a descendant of the faith part of Abraham all right Abraham believed God and it was imputed for righteousness that's the same way with you and I listen to me that's the same way that God imputes righteousness to you is the did you believe we're gonna read the right here Paul asked the question what shall we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if Abraham were justified by words in other words going behind the building and taking them taking the you know the knife and cut his foreskin off it if he was justified by that than man you can throw away what Christ did okay that's what's Paul trying to tell you can throw away Christ on the cross all you need to do males was gonna be circumcised and then you females according to the Old Testament were circumcised live a male not physically but you were circumcised when you marry and you have a hand your father that all come under certain season in the Old Testament now don't happen now all right you're not saying because your mama say you know I'm saving could you dance they run all right we're Baberaham were justified by works he hath we're born of glory but not before God you can't glory before God that did he listen in the condition we're in now it does it's not that God didn't care about circumcision because you really done you don't care whether you're physically circumcised your client he okay that's what he's saying here but how are you going to glory in something of works but how you going to play sure Abraham to glory at the moment and the Old Testament Abraham could say I am a circumcised person that's what they were getting into with the temple because in Jews man they hung on that circumcision walked in the temple and Timothy where one of them was not circumcised and they're like you're this pile in the temple well see that's what Paul is dealing with right here he's dealing with hey we know Abraham we know that he could show he was a do we know that you have this lineage but Christ has come God has come in the flesh then do away with all that flesh that a man and they go into the heart of the person doesn't either stop him and embrace it he said if you look on a woman to lust after now you've committed okay now in the Old Testament you long as you didn't touch him you can thank in your mind and have intercourse in your mind with them in other words and you know what it wasn't County but when Jesus come he said no no it's the inward man that we're talking about here okay it's - telling you they they really enjoy the winter cool in Oklahoma I'm talking about the the flesh because you know you you take the flesh out of this whole thing your flesh just manifest once on the inside period only it doesn't sin your flesh done saying don't forget about it no where am I trying to beat the flesh up let's go out and get the person inside right and the flesh will follow wherever Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof the glory but not before God the heck do you see what Paul did nothing but not before God hey grab the glory on the earth all the one two hey I'm with you around my circumcised person but gods like I'll accept that for the moment but that's not the whole deal evany when he knew he recognized Abraham's faith because watch for what's that the scripture alright pay for him believe God that's Genesis 3:20 we got you Scofield Bible abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness I reckoned are imputed are put to his account and what did count that he went die circumcised it was that he believed what God told him to do and he got up and did it and you know what there was no reservation in his heart to do it he just gotta do now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of dead like Auto just number I don't know to you with that he pay the day he did not owe I owe the dead I could not pay the debts on that so now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt in other words Abraham could not say and I don't believe Abraham did say alright done at ninety nine years old I went back here in the tent and I circumcised myself I went through all this pain and agony now you owe me something see that's not Abraham that wouldn't have been able him now that might have been a lot of other people that begrudgingly done that because remember Abraham circumcised his whole household and his kids were up you are Ishmael was anyway you understand one thing yeah so that was a little bit grudging maybe but Abraham I don't believe I believe what he believed in God and went done what he done without a dead God you owe me something now Abraham never in Scripture said God you owe me no and that's the way you better not be you know God I will live 40 years I went to church you owe me you don't owe you nothing all right so now see how the scripture is no look but to him that worketh not but what believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly it's not reason to justify love just yeah you don't justify just now you do now because the just and the justifier is the same this is after crisis come this is after we come under this evil anointing we see that we are just as righteous as God is all right now Abraham I don't believe he saw that because it wasn't really up to him that he was just as righteous and God we did he had a little different attitude okay but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly watch , his faith is counted for righteousness not his works but his faith is counted for righteousness we got to believe things that we don't see we got to believe things before they come knowing that they're coming but you still gotta believe you still got ability we've got to believe all this do you believe that it's gonna be actually anyone come yeah not for us yeah but you know what we're part of it we're in the process and it's proved on that for sale if once they had a force field proves the rapture takes place hello just come off the earth alright look now watch verse six even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works alright saying alright you got that saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute what's impute rechtin sin because look even david under the blood of bulls and goats because look around him whose sins are covered mine and your sins are covered on a daily basis but mine and your sins in the soul are not just covered they're gone but now that when Abraham see this all this proves that they didn't have the new birthing in the attempt in the Old Testament they couldn't get rid of the sin inside the soul there was no burner there was no works there was no circumcision that's what Paul meant there was no circumcision of the heart in the Old Testament it was just a fleshly outward works that God said okay I'll accept that from the moment but remember remember David was a man after God's own heart the end work partner David the flesh partner David was I would have shot him if I'd have been you arriving if I don't live through that battle and found out what he did to my wife and was gonna do to me I shot him if I was in the Old Testament I'd ask for forgiveness in the new like I said why would you write and I made it through that battle and somebody told me that David purposely was gonna have me merged he'd have been identity minute he invented anything I mean really I mean that's the way it was but he wasn't that way we know that because God knew David listen talk knew David was going to do this before the foundation of the world he mutant David was going to do that but he knew that David that struggle of the two people that struggle of the anointing of God being on David because he was a good guy God had already anointed him to be king so he couldn't take that away okay so that part was what saved him really when we know the property come in and spoke Greek same thing with all of us but it was truly what David that David was anointed to be king of Israel and they went unnoticed hopping you know yes yes because an anointing anointings following your spirit anointings don't following your salt if I understand that because anointed ones are black on the soul in the Soul they say it's it's Satan just saying Satan in the soul but anointed by the true Holy Ghost own their spirit I said anointed ones see to me anointed ones was what was in the Old Testament they were anointed ones they weren't bright they were anointed by God but their soul was still where they lost no see you gotta remember this go back to where the new birth he turned a lot of his to different things the new birth and eternal life two different things because the foolish virgin is not going to give you eternal life in their soul they're not going to be born again they're gonna be given eternal life at the white throne judgment Amen all right couple water my name so this is black as it can be just a whoremonger whoremongers but at the end God's going to give them eternal life well it's gotta be the soul it's gonna be the soul because it's the soul that senate that died of this but let's tell them in Barnesville it's that stole that we got to work on the soul of the person we can anoint the spirit we can clean the flesh of we can put all kind of stuff on it okay still black still black on the inside if you so I'm not born again then it's just a dark place is this abuse just alright say it's the dark horse you know it's basic black horse rider not just anoint you but now see when saving Superman towns God Superman came and it was God in human flesh and man when saying the Superman comes when we leave out here when Saint Superman come it will be Satan incarnate in human flesh you don't see that trumps nominee for Supreme Court just evening out he suggests you late yes he come from Notre Dame he was a gesture with freedom yeah so it's getting close folks is getting close it's getting close we got so many dude with so many Catholics I think there's only one Protestant on the Supreme Court now so we'll see you know what let them and let that let that be the way it is because it's nothing to me I can't stop it you came either it's for working around the hands of God you know but to him that worketh not that's what I want you to see that watch Paul Paul is separating the Old Testament from the New Testament he's separating because remember the the great maybe it's not a falling out between Paul and James but in commentaries and then people bring in the scripture they've always said Paul said you're saved by faith James says you saved by works and brother Branham preached works his faith expressed now when that flips it all right together Paul I'm not saying it's all my faith and it doesn't matter what you do James is not saying it's all my works and your soul can be black into the midnight no they meant James is saying if you've got faith this is what you'll do I think Paul st. Paul said if you got faith don't worry about circumcision then worry about being righteous it's the inside man that makes right to righteousness because what st. blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin now I'm going to read the dialogue and listen to this and if you got your Bible and read one through what I've read what we just read but I'm gonna read you what the die Glocke said this is this is really good why then shall we say of Abraham our forefather according to the flesh for Abraham was justified by works he has a ground of boasting but not before God all right for what say the scripture and abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness now to him who works the reward is not accounted as a favor but as a debt you see that everybody brings it out a lot clearer right there for to him who does not work but who believed on him who justifies the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness all right that was verse 5 but to him who does not work but who believed on him was justified the ungodly his faith is come for us to even for 6 even as david also speaks of the blessing this of the man to knew God accounts righteousness apart from works that's the great I said that's the great dissertation that they go through when Paul said it's all by faith and don't worry about the words because you see that in denomination because you know what that's the basic for Baptist doctrine once saved always say regardless smoke cigarette you know do whatever drink the beers and cuts and all it what I got my letter and that's what they're saying and they have a valid point if you just read it like this I believe God save me that's what somebody's I believe God saved me well if you believe it but if God really did accept your faith then the works behind it will account for the faith that you have right verse 7 saying happier they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered happy is the man thinking of the Lord went on accounts in alright let's go to verse 9 we've done okay everybody all right verse 9 cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for a we study that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness coz watch listen Abraham's faith was reckoned before he was circumcised write in Genesis 12 when God said get up pay for him go to another country hey bruh ham gets up no see God started at County what's gonna count you build up things you know you put money in an account because it build that all right so if the count was building way before he was circumcised because when God called him he was in his seventies when he was circumcised he was in his nineties so he walked all in the air so you know that's why I say you can walk through justification and sanctification but you don't have the circumcision of the heart yet the Holy Ghost is don't think that he'll circumcise our do away with all that mind not only this this inside your soul right so he walked for years and God was accounting it for righteousness right and you know what the little the states along the way like I heard preachers that one time let's just recall Paul is looking back into the Old Testament through the cross with Grace and Sam Abraham was strong in faith never wavered and everything was fine and dandy now you go back over there and read he tried it with his handmade right Dinah smell taste miles down to Greer and give her away twice so you know you look at all that and you go and then Abraham laughs at God you see all that that's just human stuff that's like our all of our human stuff we're going to be really Bible says former things to be passed away all things become new we won't remember all the bad things and all the trials and tribulations that we went through it I don't believe them why would you want to believe why would you want why wouldn't you want to take that with you in eternity no no thank you but it's a five here though we have to fight it here it's got to be fought here when the bottle of one it's gonna be one right here no may want to have it's gonna be one right here that's what we're talking about here the battle then is an inward gopikas watching cometh the blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also what we say that faith was renting to abraham for righteousness how was it directed if he went by certain thing to do when time serves in Newcombe at the flesh when he was in circumcisions are in uncircumcision not looks good look I just explained that I just explained this how was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncertainty look not in circumcision by a circumcision because he walked a long time and uncircumcision right but God reckoned his faith in uncircumcision because remember those who he has justified he is already Lawrence I did not Abraham give him let me let me put this right now glorified body he got changed folks whether it was plank the flesh he went from ninety nine to twenty that's enough for me I wouldn't you couldn't keep me in a ten step Sara was in there I guess so anyway how was he randomly a watch never but look verse eleven here's the here's the whole thing and he received the sign of circumcision they seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God will by your wife seal those come like the Holy Ghost his circumcision was a seal it got accepted his face what a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had give me an uncircumcised because really your faith is reckoned to you when you go to the altar and saying God forgive me of my sins you have to have faith that somebody does away with them you got to have faith that you call him whatever you want to call him a lot of God or whatever but somebody has done away with your sin how could you be a Christian you could I mean you know sure you go back to bed and you got the same old nature and all that stuff we know that but God has done something if you never want the justification you should know exactly when you go I know exactly when I went through a man felt good and clean but still had the root of evil I have to go on to sanctification I had to go on to the baptism of all the go find my same with all of us a steal of the righteous is to faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe not a father of all then they'd be circumcised he said that he may be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also let me read this one more and then we'll come in men and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised because you know what the Jews were doing the Jews were going where Abraham seed where the faith seed of Abraham by natural lineage and he was circumcised then we were circumcised and that's what we depend on right they were boasting now you see what both they got over there you know you know I supposed to do that but they were boasting and they call hopes up in cities okay bring before a listless looking Genesis cuz you don't follow me the script he said bring that thing out here let's look at Genesis chapter 20 was he circumcised no he went surfing well didn't he start his journey when God said get up get out of her chair of days and don't go and I'll tell you about and get up and you know and the Jesus is like hmm in other words we've never heard anybody tell us this before but see they later at all owned of Abraham was circumcised and he was the father of our circumcision then we serve besides the world cable god right right the Apollo comes along and says I think it was in people you know the faith talking about was reckoned to Abraham the day he got up and walked out why are you saying that was circumcision because he walked right here look verse 12 and the bottle turns into nibbling on all eternity but it will also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised and boy that's one the Jews hated Paul that's why they killed him all right right because look let's read thirteen and we'll stop right there on 13 and then we'll read them died one for the promise now what is the promise that he should be the heir of the world member what did God tell Abraham forever the sole of your feet goes look up in the stars look down at the sand your seeds going to be counted now he's not talking about natural lineage God is talking about spiritual lineage what faith this whole thing is built on faith and whether you can believe or not right for the promise Calma that he should be the heir of the world comma was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith everything's got to be based on faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void in other words look all I got to do is I'm paying circumcised I'm talking to people let's go have a beer let's go get married before down look you see one thing yeah you can't do that though cuz what Paul you know what Paul was watching them Billy they were fair season you know which circumcised week we could link um in the temple you go in and out of God God's blessing us Paolo said your blessing is fixing to be done away with because when Christ came under the law he took away all that and it's gotta be by faith let me read let me go down to 16 and then we'll stop for when for him they which are of the law be haters faith as they boy write the natural lineage of Abraham if it was a natural the the Isaac and the Ishmael and the seven children he had after that they were natural descendants away from him if it was just a natural lineage then faith is made void you have to have no faith you just got to be married into the route mom and dad taught me you got to be born of the wrong under the right mom and a right all right and the promise made of none effect see that promise went totally away if it's all by lineage because they did hold to their lineage and they still helped to it Jesus had to deal with it now polity on the deal with you know because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith then it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed now I circled that my Bible and I wrote what when I write on it Genesis 1:26 and 27 cuz that's the seed he's talking about Christ not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all all right let me read now I'm gonna read the dialogue listen to this verse 9 is this blessedness then on the circumcision question mark are also on their uncertainty for we affirm faith was accounted to him for righteousness how then was it accounting when he was in circumcision or uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the symbol of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of that faith which he had while in uncircumcision which means Abraham didn't just come up with this great faith after he was circumcised that's the whole point hey Graham tell him just because he come up one day and was circumcised maybe I'm just starting believing no that was really the end of his journey next year he had to bleed for the child but brother Graham said he believed the child first day God told it 25 years before that all right well we got to believe we got to believe not in hey if I'm gonna heaven if Hannah was sitting here today fill all the Holy Ghost and in turn there's no faith to that there's no faith to that she said but the faith is I don't see her maybe I'm didn't see the baby but he had counted God had counted his face and that's when the baby comes God is gonna count my faith that she's gonna be getting man and then you think the same same way don't matter 6 for 10 minutes and interact to take place or 10 minutes in the world you put whatever no matter a man in order that he might be the father of all uncircumcised believers this is in bold letters believers that the righteousness may be accounted to them so it's only kind of the believers alright verse 12 and a father of circumcision not only to those who are of circumcision but to those more tread in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham in other words anybody circumcised or uncircumcised if you've got the faith of Abraham you're walking in his footsteps which he had an uncertain future verse 13 for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be an inheritor of a world I like that and the world is capital letter inheritor of a world was not through law but through the righteousness of faith for if those of the law are heirs the faith becomes useless and the promise abrogated I have not looked at word up now look at the Hamburg a baby ro G AED abrogated besides come up verse 15 the law works out wrath no where's the law as a destroyer look what happened let's look what how many Old Testament they destroyed people but where law is not there is no transgression all right verse 16 right here who finished right here on account of this it is from faith that it may be according to favor in order that the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that of the law only but to that of the faith of Abraham who is a father of us all to wait for him nothing by flesh he's our father by faith we take the same faith Abraham had and say God I'm just gonna go on what you told me you told me I would have children a lineage and we would have less in another world that's what it is maybe our faith was not of this world 99 years old though they were doctor in the country and say I'm gonna have a baby in there you don't know this world and then what's your some worry yeah right so faith is not of this world this world is not built on faith this world is built don't do this don't do that do this don't do that y'all know that everything is reaction in or you know accident reactive nitrogen in a reaction Abram had no reaction everybody's telling things when he was 99 years old but he still said God you said this was gonna happen and I've got this Ishmael and he's wild child and he ain't even my household now remember he went away and you told man I had one in my household and then he comes one day he says okay in for him now I got you in the place you gonna have to do Serifos remember he never told he never told the whole story to Abraham he didn't say you and stare I'm gonna have this baby or he would have never had relations with issue with the Hagar but he said you're gonna have a child then he comes a little bit longer just like in your journey you don't give you all the revelation at one time mm-hmm he gives you pieces it gives you pieces of Revelation that you can handle at the time you need it maybe for him didn't need it at first but now God said okay mmm you and Sarah are gonna have this baby and Abraham been saying yeah sure he laughs but he had enough faith to stand up and go okay I can't do it so what happened was he had to meet God he met God in human flesh the son of man he met Darlene human flesh she told him all the things we've had a man come brother Brown will come what at least on a manly he was a son of man showing us the feast on the man was here what the program desert anything are one thing he did not desert as a human being one thing it was God I got it in here I read that the other day I can't remember they may be able to stay tuned he's talking about another dimension because he will be getting the fifth seal let's go beyond another dimension all right that happened all these other four seals happened in this dimension but still happened in another dimension but he said he said I go in another dimension so that's what a prophet does he does it and he can't do it self thought has to take him in the leg of me all right so let's go that word means unknown I know navigate that one
