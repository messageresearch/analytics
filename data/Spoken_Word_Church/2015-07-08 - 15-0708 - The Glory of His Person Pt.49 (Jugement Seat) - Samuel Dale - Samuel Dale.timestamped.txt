[4:18] verse 9 and then read through uh verse
[4:22] 15 for the service
[4:25] tonight says and I John who also am your
[4:29] brother and and companion in Tribulation
[4:31] and the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[4:33] Christ was in the aisle that is called
[4:35] patmas for the word of God for the
[4:37] testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the
[4:40] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[4:42] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[4:46] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[4:48] and the last and what thou see us write
[4:51] in a book and send it unto the seven
[4:54] churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus
[4:57] unto samna and to pergamus and unto tyat
[5:00] Tyra and Sardis and under Philadelphia
[5:02] and un lady OA and I turned to see the
[5:06] voice that spake with me and being
[5:08] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[5:11] and one in the midst of the seven
[5:12] candlesticks like unto the son of man
[5:15] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[5:17] and GED about the pouch with a golden
[5:19] girdle and his head and his hairs were
[5:21] white like wool as white as snow and his
[5:24] eyes were as a flame of fire and his
[5:28] feet like a defined br
[5:30] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[5:32] voice as the sound of many Waters you
[5:37] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[5:39] to the reading of the
[5:42] word now last Wednesday I believe it was
[5:45] when we're we're trying to speak a
[5:48] little bit about the the dispensation of
[5:53] the son of man and bringing it down to
[5:55] our day and our time you know to where
[5:58] we are and just a review just a tad but
[6:01] then what we're going to do if the Lord
[6:03] willing we can pick up a little bit in
[6:06] here and move on
[6:09] into uh something that I believe will
[6:12] help us to see because what has been our
[6:17] point it says in verse 13 there one like
[6:20] unto the son of man it doesn't say it's
[6:23] the son of man because he's it's not him
[6:25] there physically
[6:27] standing but he's in his church and I
[6:31] hope that has uh you know got to the
[6:34] point with you to where that you can see
[6:36] that to see that the word made flesh is
[6:41] the son of man all right then brother
[6:44] bradam is not the son of man he was a
[6:47] son of man he said that the son of man
[6:50] used to bring the message so the son of
[6:53] man is the Lord Jesus Christ all right
[6:56] putting him in the church ages
[7:00] and we will get to that a little more
[7:03] and putting him into the position then
[7:05] you can see this is truly right when it
[7:09] said one like unto the son of man
[7:11] because he's in another form he's in his
[7:15] final form now that's the what I want if
[7:18] I don't get it tonight we'll get to it
[7:20] Sunday I want you to see something here
[7:23] on this point because this first chapter
[7:29] it starts in showing Jesus Christ you
[7:32] know in the Revelation and thing and it
[7:34] comes to a
[7:36] conclusion in the last scene or or U
[7:43] happening uh you know the Book of
[7:45] Revelations in there a lot of scenes is
[7:47] you know shows it in pictures or or
[7:50] whatever in scenes and see this tonight
[7:52] if you'll catch it and then Sunday we'll
[7:55] really lay heavy on it that this first
[7:59] chapter
[8:00] covers from the
[8:02] beginning of time to the ending of
[8:07] time all right now then you'll see then
[8:11] where that it ends up at because it ends
[8:14] up at the white
[8:16] Throne all right then being the white
[8:19] Throne judgment it winds up there as the
[8:23] end of all time or any connection to
[8:28] time or any you know whatsoever and I
[8:32] want you to see that because that'll
[8:35] show you where that what God thinks of
[8:37] you and
[8:38] I because of the position he places Us
[8:41] in all right but remember that now and
[8:44] think about it because see the the you
[8:47] know here we are the order of events uh
[8:50] the next is the rapture and then you go
[8:52] to the tribulation period with your with
[8:55] your Jews and the bringing out and the
[8:58] two witnesses and and then you have the
[9:00] millennial Reign and then you know you
[9:03] have Armageddon in the millennial Reign
[9:05] and then you have uh a Gog and Magog
[9:09] which is a cleansing of all things and
[9:12] the life just prior to the Future home
[9:15] is the white Throne judgment all right
[9:19] so keep that lined up in your mind and
[9:22] it'll help you and then you come back
[9:25] see and and and you'll see that that
[9:27] what we've been talking about all these
[9:31] Services is trying to see where we're at
[9:36] and he shows us here where we
[9:39] are in this situation and what this
[9:42] scene is all right but now we'll get to
[9:45] that in a moment but we were trying to
[9:48] cover how that
[9:51] what that brother randam says there
[9:53] three uh dispensations you know you got
[9:57] it as Son of God son of
[10:00] man and then you've got it to coming
[10:02] down as son of David all right but
[10:07] really you got it son of man Son of God
[10:09] Son of David be totally correct all
[10:12] right but then there's got to be
[10:14] something happened because it is was son
[10:19] of man back there in human flesh the
[10:22] word made flesh all right the Redeemer
[10:25] the Savior yall and all and that's why
[10:28] it was spoke of like that and why he
[10:30] kept speaking Jesus kept talking about
[10:33] who the man say I the son of man am all
[10:36] right because that's what he was doing
[10:38] son of man then has to do with uh the
[10:42] word coming forth all right making flesh
[10:46] according to verse 14 it says and the
[10:48] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[10:50] all right then he gave his life and
[10:55] released that life at Calvary to where
[10:58] that it had come back into the people
[11:02] that were gathered in the upper room and
[11:04] then the 3,000 outside and the the
[11:06] coming down and it started another
[11:10] dispensation and none of those people
[11:13] through there could have any
[11:15] understanding as I even said about the
[11:17] Apostle Paul Paul never spoke anything
[11:20] about son of
[11:22] man you know I'm not saying he didn't
[11:26] understand I wouldn't say that
[11:28] whatsoever but he never spoke of it so
[11:31] maybe he was withholding by the Holy
[11:34] Spirit to De to deal into those things
[11:37] he spoke of heavenly things he spoke of
[11:39] future he spoke of all kind of doings
[11:43] but yet he never spoke of son of
[11:45] man right now Matthew Mark Luke and John
[11:50] spoke of the son of man but remember
[11:52] Matthew Mark Luke and John was not
[11:54] written till about ad50 from there on
[11:56] through and coming on in and so even the
[12:01] greatest of all that as they were doing
[12:04] John never mentions in his
[12:08] writings I I hope you follow that nobody
[12:11] mentioned the son of man and any of
[12:15] their
[12:15] writings you know Matthew Mark Luke and
[12:18] John you say that but remember that was
[12:20] the still in the Old
[12:23] Testament we've tried to get that across
[12:25] for a long time you know and uh that's
[12:28] what the brother you know he said
[12:29] where's the first book of the New
[12:31] Testament and way and I both said you
[12:33] know the book of Acts and you know
[12:37] because see I understood that in the
[12:39] Baptist
[12:40] Church if you ask a good Baptist where's
[12:42] the first book in the New Testament and
[12:44] he'll tell you the book of Acts because
[12:47] the Holy Ghost was not
[12:49] given Jesus Christ was not crucified
[12:52] during the Matthew Mark Luke and John so
[12:55] it began on the day of Pentecost of the
[12:57] New Testament form to bring it out and
[13:00] bring it into being all right see then
[13:03] when it did it brought by that new birth
[13:06] coming into you and I put in a
[13:08] dispensation would be called Son of
[13:11] God which is the Holy Spirit dwelling in
[13:14] each one of us by the new birth all
[13:16] right and that would dwell down through
[13:18] the seven Church ages as that Son of
[13:23] God all right then you will go from Son
[13:25] of God to son of David but there's the
[13:28] mystery
[13:30] that have tried to get you to see for 40
[13:32] something years the mystery was
[13:35] there
[13:37] that Jesus spoke himself and said I'm
[13:41] coming back he spoke of his turn
[13:44] returning the coming of the son of man
[13:46] you know and he spoke of those things
[13:49] throughout his ministry but they still
[13:52] it was withholding from their
[13:55] understanding right even though they
[13:58] were the great writers of the Bible
[14:02] right and it was withholden until the
[14:04] last days cuz that's what Jesus said in
[14:07] the day Luke 17:30 when the son of man
[14:10] is revealed right all right we've tried
[14:13] to explain it back there through the
[14:14] thing that he asked the disciples one
[14:16] day he said who do Man say I the son of
[14:18] man
[14:20] am well look how God was going to seal
[14:23] it off and leave it that way to where
[14:26] they wouldn't understand son of man so p
[14:29] said Thou Art the
[14:31] Christ the son of the Living
[14:34] God right Jesus looked at him and said
[14:39] Peter and you don't
[14:42] understand but yet you understand enough
[14:45] to where the truth can come forth and he
[14:47] said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[14:50] church rocks built on the revelation of
[14:52] Jesus Christ right now and in doing that
[14:56] then see he would become from son of God
[14:59] Son of Man the Son of God and down
[15:01] through the church ages you'd have the
[15:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost but a secret
[15:07] in the word that was there covered up to
[15:11] where man would not be able to see it
[15:13] that Jesus would be speaking of a
[15:17] returning of himself not in physical
[15:21] form not as a Corporal body you know no
[15:25] no no come on no don't go that way but
[15:28] he would come back as the son of
[15:32] man right and as he would do that it
[15:36] would start with
[15:39] who he would have to have a son of man
[15:42] to introduce the son of man cuz you
[15:44] couldn't just walk out and you know it's
[15:47] it was like he was then he walked out
[15:48] and he said who the man say I the son of
[15:50] man now nobody caught
[15:53] it the best they could do was what the
[15:55] Holy Spirit revealed to Peter that thou
[15:58] art the Christ
[16:00] in other words Jesus said all right
[16:02] Peter you've got it we'll build a church
[16:04] on this but one day I'll come back and
[16:08] cap that church off with a with myself
[16:13] being
[16:14] revealed all right now then we're not
[16:17] looking or was not looking wasn't
[16:19] supposed to be looking for the coming of
[16:22] in an
[16:23] individual as a human being to be the
[16:27] son of man
[16:29] but God would have to send us a prophet
[16:32] all right so he sent a prophet in the
[16:34] end time you go back to 40 I know it's
[16:38] 48 the first one I found it may have
[16:41] even been in 47 I know it's in 48 when
[16:43] run around and talks about son of
[16:47] man all right now what do you think
[16:49] about all the
[16:51] theologians if the
[16:53] disciples didn't understand son of man
[16:57] and didn't even write about son man how
[17:00] do you think those theologians that
[17:02] begin to hear the prophet
[17:05] speaking we know nothing about it is he
[17:08] trying to make himself
[17:09] something and then when he would show
[17:11] the sign of the son of man the healings
[17:15] and miracles and things then they
[17:17] couldn't follow it as to relate and say
[17:20] this is it this is what we've been
[17:21] looking for this is what the Bible says
[17:24] would come cuz they had no idea that it
[17:27] said it would come
[17:30] they had no
[17:32] concept of that to be
[17:35] coming there wasn't looking for the
[17:37] coming of the son of
[17:40] man why because he knew nothing about
[17:43] it all right and see look at the prophet
[17:47] year after year after year after year
[17:50] trying to get the people to
[17:55] understand what was going on in his
[17:58] ministry
[18:01] and what would he
[18:03] do like a a lady that brother M him knew
[18:07] of she was supposed to had spiritual
[18:09] gifts and things and she said well I've
[18:11] never seen no greater in William than
[18:13] what was in William brandom's Ministry
[18:15] except in my
[18:17] own you know except in my
[18:20] own all they seen was
[18:24] gifts they never saw that he was trying
[18:26] to bring a message right that's right
[18:29] you know that brother randam in his
[18:30] early Ministry used to let other people
[18:32] preach for it and then he come out and
[18:35] and would pray for the
[18:40] sick but see all at once he stopped
[18:42] doing
[18:44] that he started doing his own
[18:47] preaching all right I ain't got very
[18:50] much sense but I got enough sense to
[18:52] know them other Fells couldn't preach
[18:54] what he wanted them to
[18:56] preach you know they could get it right
[18:59] so he you know the Lord showed him to go
[19:01] on his own and bring the message all
[19:04] right and as he begin to speak to us
[19:08] throughout the Bible and explain the
[19:11] thing expound upon the great things that
[19:15] would take
[19:16] place and as he did he begin to talk
[19:19] about the church ages and the
[19:21] things and he begin to speak about this
[19:25] son of man all right
[19:29] if you think it's hard for me to preach
[19:31] about son of man now you ought have been
[19:32] with me in 1969 in Athens Georgia when I
[19:35] tried my best to explain Son of God Son
[19:39] of Man son of David and that the Bride
[19:41] of Jesus Christ would be the son of man
[19:44] made manifest in the last days you have
[19:46] been
[19:47] there when you was getting those burning
[19:50] eyes cutting you into two you know
[19:53] because nobody knew what I was talking
[19:55] about I'm sorry but I I believe it
[19:59] and I was still trying to preach it cuz
[20:01] I still believe it all right I don't
[20:03] believe brother Bram is the son of man
[20:06] that would make him the Lord Jesus
[20:08] Christ all right but he was a son of man
[20:12] a
[20:13] prophet that the son of man the prophet
[20:17] could come and speak through to bring us
[20:20] the message well the people wanted
[20:22] brother brandham in his early Ministry
[20:24] just as they wanted the Lord Jesus oh
[20:27] yeah they was glad Jesus was around when
[20:30] he was Healing The Sick and feeding the
[20:32] people and oh yeah they likeed that but
[20:36] when he begin to say I and my fathers
[20:39] one what brother brother say about that
[20:41] one day he said when you begin to say I
[20:44] am my father's one and these other thing
[20:47] he said that shuck will start pulling
[20:49] away from you why because they don't
[20:51] know what you're talking about that's in
[20:53] plain language all right but the thing
[20:55] of what I was trying to get over Sunday
[20:57] I mean last Wednesday in the services
[20:59] before is
[21:01] what no one no one person
[21:04] now can be the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:08] manifested in flesh that day was over
[21:11] back dire but as he would come into the
[21:14] bride of Christ and make himself
[21:18] manifest all right and he start doing
[21:21] those things as the Holy Spirit dwelling
[21:24] among us and it would even be on the
[21:27] zeusa street that brought around said
[21:29] that was the great prophet that
[21:31] came well you don't hear nobody talk
[21:33] about isusa Street except it was false
[21:35] and all the bad things that went
[21:37] on come on I'm asking you have you ever
[21:40] heard anybody talk about it
[21:43] no they don't talk about that we're
[21:47] Beyond this they don't talk about the
[21:50] faith of the father's you know the
[21:52] stature of a perfect man oh we're Beyond
[21:55] these things yeah Beyond it all right
[21:59] you can see where they went
[22:01] to they went to their own two Souls Two
[22:03] Lords seventh universes peruses you know
[22:06] all kind of things and went off on to
[22:08] the garbage cans with it all right but
[22:12] that don't change God's word that's
[22:16] right somebody has got to be the word
[22:19] made flesh in the last days because your
[22:21] Prophet was the one that said it the
[22:24] Bible says it amen so it's got to be but
[22:26] it can't be in one person
[22:29] I've drove that for 40 something years
[22:32] the Bride of Jesus Christ around the
[22:35] world
[22:36] today and the little part we have and
[22:39] the little part others have and all put
[22:40] it all together and you got the ministry
[22:43] of Jesus
[22:44] Christ dwelling on Earth that's why
[22:47] signs and wonders are not in one place
[22:50] like they was with the prophet and the
[22:51] things but that don't do away with signs
[22:53] and wonders cuz we still believe in them
[22:56] you know we still and have seen God do
[22:59] things all right now but are you
[23:01] following me see that's what he's doing
[23:04] and the prophet said there was in
[23:06] between now I'm speaking from the
[23:09] message that I used our Sunday or
[23:11] Wednesday was um does God change his
[23:14] mind about
[23:16] his does God change his
[23:19] mind he said you went down through the
[23:21] church ages said then it be you know
[23:24] talking about son of man which is a
[23:26] prophet Son of God which went through
[23:29] the church ages then son of David said
[23:32] but in between the Son of God and the
[23:34] son of David according to his own word
[23:38] and according to Malachi 4 and many
[23:40] scriptures he us to return back into his
[23:44] church in physical form in the people in
[23:49] in human beings the way of being a
[23:53] prophet do you know that every member of
[23:55] the body of Jesus Christ is
[23:57] prophetic right
[23:59] if not what are you going to tell me the
[24:00] Holy Ghost is I thought the Holy Ghost
[24:03] was the prophet right
[24:07] amen you know I thought about this the
[24:09] other day and I'm sorry I but I try to
[24:14] tell you the
[24:15] truth you know if the Trinity had never
[24:18] been
[24:21] taught are you with me if the Trinity
[24:24] had never been
[24:26] taught you wouldn't have to have
[24:28] preached about one God you would have
[24:31] already had it coming out of the
[24:33] word right but because the Trinity was
[24:38] developed by mankind in opposition to
[24:42] the word
[24:45] right then it's hard to preach a
[24:47] word it's hard to preach it and hard to
[24:50] see it even for Born Again Christians
[24:54] come
[24:56] on because that devil has so many
[24:59] inroads of you know talking about the
[25:02] Trinity you know praise Father Son and
[25:06] Holy Ghost well I do too I praise him
[25:10] but he's not three that's
[25:13] right all right see if it had never been
[25:20] taught about the to the people
[25:24] that well you don't have nothing I don't
[25:28] have nothing we're just all sitting down
[25:32] waiting you say I never heard nobody
[25:35] teach
[25:37] that well well wake
[25:39] up wake up wake up have you ever heard
[25:43] God don't do like he used to
[25:46] do you ever heard that say
[25:49] it come on we all come through the
[25:51] denominations we heard the preachers
[25:53] right we preach it we done it
[25:54] ourselves was we say and then well God
[25:57] just don't do now like he used to
[26:00] do now just bring that on up in a higher
[26:02] order and you come to find out they're
[26:04] denying the word of God right but we
[26:07] didn't think it in did we we thought it
[26:10] was a
[26:12] truth well what you getting at brother
[26:14] Dale I'm getting to the point of one
[26:17] thing if it hadn't have been taught by
[26:19] the people of this
[26:21] message after the prophet brought his
[26:24] message that you and I are nothing and
[26:28] just sitting around and waiting on a bus
[26:30] to pull up or something to get us out of
[26:33] here I wouldn't have to read these
[26:36] quotes over and over to you that brother
[26:39] brandham said the Bride of Jesus Christ
[26:41] would be the son of man right made
[26:45] manifest in a many membered
[26:49] body you see what I'm talking about it's
[26:52] just as it was with the Trinity had it
[26:54] never been taught we wouldn't have had
[26:55] to fult that out to try to bring and it
[26:57] took it took the prophet 30 years he
[27:00] said 30 something years before he said
[27:02] he could ever preach this statue of a
[27:04] perfect man now that's in the book The
[27:06] stature of a perfect man why did it take
[27:09] him that long before he could preach
[27:13] it because the people didn't believe it
[27:17] they didn't even believe it when he
[27:19] preached
[27:23] it you see you say the Bride of Jesus
[27:26] Christ is to be the son of man
[27:28] I just don't well well maybe brother
[27:31] Dale maybe in a way you remember the
[27:34] quote from brother brandom he said when
[27:36] you say maybe in the way he said there's
[27:37] no such thing he said it's not maybe in
[27:39] the way he said it's either right or
[27:40] wrong that's paraphrasing but he said
[27:42] it's either right or wrong you know it's
[27:45] either Truth Or Not truth there's no
[27:47] gray areas to the
[27:49] Bible well that's just your way of
[27:52] seeing
[27:53] it now where did that come from I sure
[27:56] didn't come from God's word
[27:58] no it sure didn't come from God then so
[28:01] it must have come from the devil but
[28:03] yeah we use it don't
[28:05] we well who do you think you
[28:08] are you
[28:09] know I got a right to believe what I
[28:11] want to believe Constitution gives you
[28:13] that yeah but the Bible don't and
[28:18] uh right now I wouldn't be too
[28:20] interested in the
[28:22] Constitution
[28:24] okay I wouldn't want to use that no more
[28:29] that I got a right you don't have no
[28:31] right for
[28:33] nothing but look what he said he said in
[28:36] between the Son of God and the son of
[28:40] David according to his own words and
[28:43] according to Malachi 4 and many
[28:45] scriptures he's to return into the his
[28:48] church in physical
[28:51] form all
[28:54] right in the people in human beings
[28:58] right in the way of being a prophet now
[29:00] that was preached in
[29:02] 1965 here's another one proving his word
[29:05] and what were we talking about the other
[29:07] day he says he comes Son of God Son of
[29:09] Man son of man Son of God Son of David
[29:12] and he said remember he comes in three
[29:14] names the son of man a prophet the Son
[29:16] of God the spirit the son of David for
[29:19] the Millennium but in between this
[29:22] conjunction now according to his own
[29:24] words in the day when the son of man
[29:27] shall be
[29:28] revealed reveal himself as what not Son
[29:33] of God Son of Man will reveal himself in
[29:36] a different way now what does that
[29:39] make melachi 4 exactly right the son of
[29:44] man will reveal himself not in a whole
[29:46] big denominations and things he said
[29:49] we've done went through that but he'
[29:51] reveal himself as son of man
[29:55] again in Bride form cuz blood of ROM
[29:58] can't be the son of
[30:00] man right he is a part of the body of
[30:04] Christ was you following me last week he
[30:06] was a part of the body of Christ that's
[30:09] right in the body of Christ a church
[30:12] aged messenger a born again Christian a
[30:16] prophet no wonder it said was said of
[30:18] him said you have more gifts and things
[30:20] than any of the prophets why because
[30:23] none of the prophets were born again
[30:25] Believers in the body of Christ
[30:30] right and see then when it comes down to
[30:34] that you're talking about the son of man
[30:38] all right now let me get a couple I
[30:41] didn't give you I didn't give them to
[30:42] them to read cuz we've been through this
[30:46] enough but look what he says on
[30:48] paragraph 222 approving his word 1964
[30:52] 8:16 and the son of man is revealing
[30:54] himself in the same power that he was
[30:58] not down through the church age through
[31:01] justification sanctification all these
[31:04] things here but the son of man watch him
[31:07] who is the son of
[31:13] man that's what he said who is the son
[31:16] of man well it was brother brandham he
[31:19] was
[31:19] it who is the son of
[31:22] man the word
[31:28] and the word is quicker and more
[31:31] powerful than a two-edged
[31:35] sword who is the son of man the word
[31:39] look at him as he gets on it's the
[31:40] rising of the sun 1965 4:18 the morning
[31:43] service who is the son of man watch him
[31:48] in the beginning was the
[31:50] word and the Word was with God and the
[31:53] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[31:56] and dwelt Among Us and if all the
[31:59] teaching that we have and confirmation
[32:01] of the word of God by word of God by
[32:05] signs and wonders and he says it comes
[32:07] down to Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 and
[32:11] different scriptures that the Dead
[32:13] traditions of man is dead and
[32:19] gone what about
[32:22] it who is the son of man in the
[32:25] beginning was the word you know if the
[32:28] Bible's right we're close to believe it
[32:30] the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness
[32:31] of the godhead bodily right so in him
[32:34] was Father Son and Holy Ghost correct
[32:36] but in him was son of man Son of God Son
[32:39] of David all back there at one time but
[32:42] it could not be made
[32:45] manifest
[32:47] right he could heal but he couldn't
[32:52] save because you're dealing with son of
[32:54] man the Bible said that the son of man
[32:56] have power to forgive sin son of man man
[32:58] has power to
[33:00] heal well son of man couldn't save
[33:05] you come
[33:07] on if Son of God is your savior but
[33:11] where was he at he was standing there on
[33:13] the shores of Galilee there was almighty
[33:16] God in human flesh son of man Son of God
[33:20] Son of David all if you think it ain't
[33:22] right what the Jews what would that
[33:24] lady what the Gentile come up to him and
[33:27] touch him
[33:28] are wanting the bread is that right and
[33:30] what did he
[33:31] say he said it's not right for me to
[33:33] take the children's bread and give it to
[33:36] you you
[33:37] dogs Gentiles were dogs no place
[33:41] whatsoever in any form to be lined up
[33:45] she said Lord said the dogs eat the
[33:48] crumbs that come off the master he said
[33:50] I ain't found that faith in Israel she
[33:53] had no right to speak of him as son of
[33:55] David we've been through all of that
[33:57] right right right but she could speak of
[34:00] him as son of man but mainly she could
[34:02] speak of him as Son of God cuz that's
[34:04] who he was cuz that's what Peter said
[34:07] look Peter said Thou Art the Christ the
[34:11] son of the Living
[34:13] God which meant he was the
[34:17] creator right John 1 Colossians 1
[34:20] Hebrews 1 James 3 is it J or
[34:24] Ephesians where all things are created
[34:27] by Him and without him there was not
[34:28] anything made that was made not that
[34:30] flesh Man Standing on Earth no it was
[34:34] the Lord Jesus Christ that was dwelling
[34:36] within that flesh that Peter
[34:39] recognized right do we see
[34:42] that see then there is a a
[34:46] mystery that he would be son of
[34:49] man then he'd be Son of
[34:53] God and just for a little period of time
[34:57] in between this son of God and Son of
[35:00] David he would come back to be son of
[35:05] man and that that would end up
[35:09] being in the Bride of Jesus Christ
[35:12] that's right couldn't be it in Luther
[35:14] couldn't be it in Wesley couldn't be it
[35:15] in Pentecost couldn't be it in O going
[35:19] but in the bride in the end
[35:21] time to be the word made
[35:25] manifest well I just don't see it you
[35:28] keep on with that attitude you never
[35:30] will see
[35:32] it that's what's wrong with the people
[35:34] of this message I just don't see that
[35:37] brother Dale just so deep I can't
[35:39] understand what he's
[35:41] saying I'm so simple you can't
[35:44] understand what's the trouble is if I
[35:46] made it deep enough you could follow
[35:49] it I mean that's just honest it I can
[35:52] answer it if I tried to make it deep you
[35:54] could follow some kind of a lineup but
[35:56] trying to make it as simple as he can
[35:57] can be I'm just simply talking about you
[36:00] right that's all I've done for 40s
[36:02] something years is talk about the Bride
[36:05] of Jesus Christ upon the Earth and who
[36:09] she really
[36:10] is and what she's
[36:12] doing she's the word made flesh all
[36:16] right she is the son of
[36:21] man see this went from Son of God to Son
[36:25] of Man all right but that don't do away
[36:29] with Son of God cuz if there's anybody
[36:31] being saved today it's got to be done
[36:33] under Son of God is anybody receiving
[36:37] the new birth it's got to be under Son
[36:39] of God so you don't do away with him you
[36:41] just let him manifest for what he's
[36:44] doing for the hour that it's being done
[36:48] all
[36:50] right and then when you do you can see
[36:53] it all come out who is this son of man
[36:58] he's the
[37:01] word
[37:03] now in the beginning was the word word
[37:05] is with God and the Word was God now
[37:09] that is not in the beginning was the
[37:12] letter you know what I mean letters
[37:15] letters Paul said the letter
[37:17] kth the spirit giveth life so Jesus
[37:21] wasn't just letters of the
[37:23] word Jesus was what those Prophets of
[37:28] the word they had brought remember the
[37:30] prophets built the body John the last
[37:33] one of the Old Testament form introduced
[37:35] the head and Christ stepped out I
[37:39] remember all
[37:41] right see then when it comes down to it
[37:45] he was that
[37:48] word forgive me who are we to
[37:53] be I thought we used to be the word made
[37:56] flesh righten
[37:57] right well I can see it in brother
[37:59] brandham you know that's the way people
[38:01] are I can see it in brother brandham but
[38:03] I just can't see it in nobody else well
[38:05] you're blind that's right that's right
[38:08] come on brother Dale will tell you right
[38:10] up front you get mad at do what you want
[38:12] to you're
[38:14] blind because the prophet is one that
[38:16] spoke of the Bride he's the one that
[38:19] said these things about the Bride of
[38:21] Jesus
[38:23] Christ then you're arguing with him
[38:26] about it
[38:29] all but see that's what it comes down
[38:33] to so are you following
[38:36] me what did we cover here throughout
[38:39] these times that we've been going
[38:40] through
[38:42] this that brother brandham gives you
[38:44] where
[38:46] there what is it I'll get it in a minute
[38:50] but he said it like this he said this is
[38:53] the bride dra
[38:55] out you remember that that you remember
[38:59] us preaching on those things while we're
[39:01] not a denomination believe it
[39:04] is he said this is the bride what did it
[39:06] say one and I turned to see The Voice
[39:10] remember we went through all that all
[39:13] right now you WR down here below we just
[39:15] read where the voice was at I was in the
[39:17] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[39:19] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[39:22] saying it was
[39:24] speaking and if you look in your Bible
[39:26] that's red letter
[39:29] that's supposed to mean God himself is
[39:31] talking right all right see then when it
[39:34] comes through that it comes up to verse
[39:36] 12 and he turned to see The
[39:40] Voice he knew the
[39:42] voice he had been with that voice for
[39:45] three and a half years on earth right he
[39:48] had heard The Parables he had heard the
[39:50] things right and when he did he turned
[39:54] to see the
[39:55] voice and the surprise was he didn't see
[39:58] Jesus in physical human
[40:02] flesh he saw one standing in the midst
[40:04] of the seven golden candlesticks like
[40:06] unto the son of
[40:08] man G about to pouch you remember we
[40:11] went through that with brother random PS
[40:13] means women you know this is a feminist
[40:16] form of God this is God in his life in
[40:22] morphe all right now this is God in his
[40:27] life
[40:29] form because
[40:32] listen this scene that we
[40:37] see is not just seeing the church ages
[40:41] and the
[40:42] things but it's so marvelous we'll pick
[40:45] that up Sunday it's so marvelously put
[40:47] that before he starts the church ages
[40:50] he's already told you how perfect you
[40:53] are because he's already described you
[40:57] as one standing in the midst of the
[40:59] seven golden Candlestick like unto the
[41:00] son of
[41:03] man you know that Daniel saw the same
[41:06] thing we'll get to that in a
[41:09] minute Daniel says one like un the son
[41:11] of man come to the Ancient of
[41:18] Days so now we're getting down to
[41:20] looking at something straight across and
[41:24] finding out
[41:25] something I hope anyway
[41:30] Hallelujah this one here is in Bride
[41:36] form all
[41:38] right and showing that what he thinks of
[41:42] the
[41:44] bride and how beautiful he shows her to
[41:50] be
[41:52] right before he ever even speaks of the
[41:55] ages or anything
[42:00] now we don't believe in
[42:01] pre-existence of souls Etc and things
[42:04] like that we believe in pre-existence of
[42:08] God right we believe in pre-existence
[42:11] even of his word we believe in
[42:14] pre-existence of every bit of his
[42:16] attributes that he ever had as healer
[42:18] savior Redeemer whatever you know
[42:21] Advocates whatever you want to bring out
[42:23] as hims to being that all of those was
[42:25] in God before the foundation the
[42:28] world all right that's why it says he
[42:30] stood as a lamb slain before the
[42:31] foundation of the world see that that
[42:33] was back in God before the world ever
[42:36] begun the best way to say it because
[42:38] what else can you say it is in God's
[42:41] mind but I hope that it has gotten away
[42:44] from just being something maybe well God
[42:47] thought of
[42:50] this because you have to be careful when
[42:52] you say God thought of it because you
[42:54] can make god making it be what he wants
[42:56] it to be as to what he thinks
[43:01] of and that would get into the wrong
[43:06] category but this is seeing before the
[43:10] world what is going to take place upon
[43:12] the
[43:15] Earth that's to me is the secret of it
[43:18] all because when he gets to the church
[43:20] ages even the first church age he says
[43:22] to the
[43:24] Overcomer every age has got a message
[43:27] message to the
[43:29] Overcomer right cuz he already knows the
[43:35] end he already knows to finish before he
[43:38] starts amen and he wrote it right here
[43:41] in chapter
[43:44] one of the whole thing the whole journey
[43:47] of
[43:49] mankind because of what this chapter
[43:52] shows
[43:55] you and when it comes down
[43:59] too one Len the son of
[44:01] man G about the pouch with a golden
[44:06] girdle starts describing him then
[44:08] doesn't
[44:13] it he turned he saw seven golden
[44:17] candlesticks one like the son of man
[44:19] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[44:22] and G about the pouch with a golden
[44:24] girdle his head and his hair
[44:27] were white like wool as white as snow
[44:30] and his eyes were as a flame of
[44:35] fire do you
[44:37] realize what that is being
[44:41] said Do You Realize where that position
[44:44] is
[44:47] at that's why we read down here because
[44:49] we read them before but not to emphasize
[44:51] so
[44:52] much and verse n
[44:55] says that
[44:58] you know he was talking about the the
[45:01] kingdom and patience verse 10 says and I
[45:04] was in the spirit on the Lord's
[45:07] day now the Lord's day is not
[45:11] Sunday that mankind developed that
[45:14] neither is the Lord day Saturday or
[45:21] Sabbath do you need this where brother
[45:23] Rand said that the Lord's Day is when
[45:25] man's days are over
[45:28] is that
[45:29] sensible that's what I call Sensible
[45:32] answers because he just simply explains
[45:34] it right out the Lord's Day means the
[45:37] day not of man right but when man's Days
[45:42] Are Over well winter man's day is
[45:46] over it's not over in the Rapture right
[45:49] now still going on it's not over in the
[45:52] tribulation after the bride leaves
[45:54] because it's still a world and people
[45:57] it's not over in Armageddon when all of
[45:59] the great battles and the great things
[46:01] happens it's not over in the millennial
[46:06] Reign the days of man is not over in the
[46:08] millennial Reign because that is to
[46:11] Israel and and and we will be there with
[46:14] him in the
[46:17] Millennium it's not over in The Great
[46:20] Battle of Goan
[46:22] Magog because that's still mankind upon
[46:25] Earth even though a lot of that is a
[46:27] spiritual situation or the fire falling
[46:29] down from heaven Etc
[46:32] yeah but where is man's days over

[46:59] dates times Seasons Etc none of
[47:02] that all right the life Earthly
[47:06] thing ever what you want to connect it
[47:09] to doing and get so great spiritual in
[47:12] your mind just remember it's the white
[47:15] Throne
[47:16] judgment all
[47:18] right just remember that's where it's at
[47:22] amen is the white
[47:23] Throne all right this description here
[47:28] here that we've been reading over and
[47:31] over and over for
[47:33] 40 this is 49 I think or either 50
[47:37] sermons that we've read this
[47:41] scripture but it did click on you of
[47:44] anything to think
[47:47] about we've dwelt heavily on the in the
[47:50] midst of seven golden
[47:53] candlesticks we've dealt heavily about
[47:56] the uh you
[47:58] know the G about the PPS to be a
[48:03] bride but we hadn't mentioned too much
[48:06] about his hair and his his head and his
[48:09] hairs were white like
[48:13] wool now you're going to the white
[48:18] Throne you realize what I'm saying that
[48:21] this first chapter shows you from the
[48:23] beginning to the total ending of mankind
[48:30] right in just a few verses it covers the
[48:33] entire journey of the Earthly part of
[48:36] mankind and winds up at the white
[48:42] Throne what about
[48:47] it look look what he says now we'll
[48:50] start we'll read just a little bit a got
[48:53] just a few quotes so go ahead brother
[48:54] we're number one now and we'll start
[48:56] reading because it comes off of Patmos
[48:58] vision and biggest portion of this is a
[49:00] continual
[49:02] reading and uh just think about
[49:06] it so we cut it down to Revel 113 the
[49:09] midst of seven gold candles scks one lik
[49:11] and the son of man
[49:12] glow clothed with a garment down to foot
[49:15] and GED by the pouch with a golden
[49:16] girdle there stands one like unto the
[49:19] son of man as a jewel is beautified by
[49:21] the mounting of the ring so is he
[49:23] glorified where in the midst of the the
[49:27] churches it is the Lord's
[49:30] day for John sees him
[49:33] standing not as a
[49:35] priest but as the coming
[49:39] judge the golden girdle is no longer GED
[49:42] about the waist where the priest were
[49:45] must wear it as he ministers to God in
[49:48] the holiest place but it is now around
[49:51] his
[49:52] shoulders for he is not now the
[49:57] priest but the
[50:00] judge okay goes on down his service has
[50:03] been
[50:04] rendered the priesthood is over the days
[50:08] of the prophecy are finished he stands
[50:11] GED as the
[50:15] judge this Scene goes all the way to the
[50:19] white Throne
[50:21] judgment which is the ending of all
[50:24] mankind in all things is to come to an
[50:27] end at that
[50:29] position of the white
[50:31] Throne oh yeah now we all know and we
[50:34] but you know all we talk about white
[50:36] Throne we're not going that's all people
[50:37] want to know whether you're going or
[50:39] not you
[50:41] know well if you're not sitting on the
[50:44] throne with him you're standing before
[50:46] him and decisions are being made so now
[50:48] that's our
[50:49] choice all right but it won't be our
[50:52] choice then it's our choice
[50:54] now all right but look what he
[51:00] covers he said this is the day of the
[51:03] judge this is
[51:05] Judgment he goes through the highest
[51:07] wied wool his feet and all and then goes
[51:10] to the sharp two-edged sword and look
[51:12] what he comes up saying How Deeply
[51:14] moving and inspiring was the appearing
[51:17] of Jesus to John who was in exile for
[51:20] the cause of the word and behold the
[51:23] Living Word stands now before him what
[51:26] an inating vision for every descriptive
[51:29] attribute has a significance what a
[51:33] revelation of his glorious
[51:36] being
[51:37] now we spent a lot of
[51:41] time
[51:45] covering and I hope that there's
[51:48] no
[51:51] uh I hope you hadn't slept through or
[51:54] ped off or missed something all that
[51:56] I've been saying because I keep saying
[51:58] it over and over to where that you'll
[52:01] remember it you know and then somebody
[52:03] come up and later and say well brother
[52:05] Dale uh I never heard you say that about
[52:07] the the bride of Christ well now bud you
[52:09] sure slept a whole lot because we've
[52:13] been on it a lot of
[52:14] services so if anybody ask you say
[52:17] what's brother Dale believe about
[52:18] Revelations 1:12 13 14 I'd be ashamed if
[52:23] you didn't explain it to them as the Bri
[52:26] out of Jesus
[52:28] Christ God he it's it's like it doesn't
[52:32] say it doesn't say one in the midst of
[52:34] seven golden Candlestick like he's
[52:35] standing there and the candles are
[52:38] around him no he's in the whole
[52:40] candlesticks the candlesticks is the
[52:42] bride of Christ going down to verse 17
[52:45] or 18 or 15 down at the bottom every
[52:47] where it get right right this is a
[52:51] vision to John this is an understanding
[52:53] to John of how beautiful God thinks
[52:56] about about his
[52:57] church and shows her as one like unto
[53:01] the son of man you remember I've said it
[53:03] to you for 40 something years in the
[53:05] Book of Revelation Jesus Christ is never
[53:08] seen by
[53:11] himself show it to me he's never seen by
[53:15] himself he's shown in his church with
[53:19] his church riding with his church or
[53:21] whatever but he's always got somebody
[53:24] with him that's right and even after we
[53:26] leave out of this Earthly Parts he's got
[53:28] the Jews to deal
[53:30] with
[53:33] right you see what I'm talking
[53:37] about now we've come to a point to see
[53:40] something that has been on my mind for
[53:42] 40 something
[53:43] sermons
[53:45] right that I hope you can
[53:48] see not just a quote that we don't go to
[53:52] the white Throne judgment you know you
[53:56] just ask ask people a question no we
[53:58] don't go to what through Jud Prophet
[54:00] said so well amen Now where's it at in
[54:03] the Bible and what's going on and show
[54:05] me the whole story of why you believe it
[54:07] that
[54:11] way
[54:12] right where is the bride at that white
[54:15] Throne
[54:22] judgment she's got to be sitting on the
[54:24] throne with him
[54:27] and she's doing the judging we'll get
[54:29] down to scriptures a minute in
[54:30] Corinthians where you even judge
[54:34] Angels but you probably thought that I
[54:36] was just praying that trying to get son
[54:38] of man son of man son of man this is
[54:41] tying together the entire Bible because
[54:43] we're going to see in the book of of
[54:44] Daniel where it's the son of
[54:50] man one
[54:52] like we're going to see where he comes
[54:54] to
[54:58] this is not just a quote we don't go to
[55:00] what
[55:02] Throne we said on the throne well amen
[55:06] okay now if that's all you got amen
[55:08] don't lose that that's truth now don't
[55:10] lose
[55:12] that but how
[55:15] come why is it that you don't stand
[55:18] before him at the white Throne whenever
[55:20] denomination there is believes we
[55:23] do you ever found one yet that believe
[55:25] we don't
[55:28] was it not taught to all of us that we
[55:30] got to go to the white
[55:33] Throne you said well no I never taught
[55:35] it well where did ever teach to you you
[55:37] wouldn't going to the white
[55:42] drone I've been around quite a while and
[55:44] I never did
[55:47] hear because it was always brother you
[55:51] better get right cuz there going to be a
[55:53] judgment day if you don't get right here
[55:57] there's going to be a judgment day
[55:59] coming that you going to have to stand
[56:02] before an Angry
[56:03] God and he's going to tell you to either
[56:07] go in or go
[56:11] out
[56:13] right well you probably didn't remember
[56:16] there like you don't remember
[56:19] now right you probably didn't listen in
[56:23] you prob around on something else
[56:27] folks
[56:28] listen you may not like me in my
[56:31] attitude but when this thing's over with

[56:35] the
[56:36] back when you find out you're sitting on
[56:38] that throne and you do it you're going
[56:40] to Pat me on the back for being mean and
[56:42] arrogant and hateful to you and
[56:44] hollering and screaming at you prise the
[56:47] Lord and I won't have no problems and
[56:49] won't say I tried to tell
[56:51] you now that's stupid stuff anyway
[56:56] you're going to thank God for somebody
[56:58] that told you the
[57:00] truth yes
[57:02] sir I went back when I left the Baptist
[57:05] Church I went back and I thank that
[57:09] preacher for all he'd ever done to help
[57:12] me to come to Jesus
[57:19] Christ I left churches in this message I
[57:22] always went and told them thank you for
[57:26] helping
[57:31] me why because what little bit they did
[57:35] help me they might have hindered in a
[57:37] lot of ways but they helped me

[1:00:47] be crowned with wisdom that is what he
[1:00:49] what the wh and glistening hir signifies
[1:00:52] now look where he goes to so look back
[1:00:56] come back down Co we want to read
[1:00:59] Daniel instead of going in the Bible you
[1:01:01] can turn your Bible if you'd like to
[1:01:02] read it in Daniel 7
[1:01:05] 9-14 I beheld the Thrones that were cast
[1:01:08] down now the white throne
[1:01:13] in is it 17 or 20 it's in here in the
[1:01:17] Book of Revelations the white Throne
[1:01:19] judgment but R said it's the same as
[1:01:21] Daniel he said that's what he
[1:01:23] saw all right we'll read that in the
[1:01:26] minute to on down into the the script in
[1:01:28] the quotes but look and I held till the
[1:01:31] Thrones were cast down and the Ancient
[1:01:32] of Days did sit you remember how he was
[1:01:35] covered in that that that wasn't because
[1:01:36] of it age or whatever whose hair was
[1:01:39] white as snow and whose garment was as
[1:01:42] white as snow and his hair of his head
[1:01:44] like pure wool his Stone was like the
[1:01:47] fiery flame and his wheels as burning
[1:01:49] fire same identical situation we've been
[1:01:51] reading in chapter
[1:01:54] one because that is the white Throne
[1:01:57] judgment the days of man is over and
[1:02:01] he's showing in chapter one what is
[1:02:03] taking place all right and the Fire EX
[1:02:05] streem issu and came forth from before
[1:02:07] him thousands thousands ministered unto
[1:02:10] him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before
[1:02:14] him the Judgment was set and the books
[1:02:16] were
[1:02:17] open white throwing judgment I beheld
[1:02:20] then because of the voice of the great
[1:02:22] words which the horn spake I beheld even
[1:02:24] till the Beast was SL and his body was
[1:02:26] destroyed and given to the burn as
[1:02:28] concerning the rest of the Beast they
[1:02:29] had their Dominion taken away yet their
[1:02:31] lives were prolonged as coming to the
[1:02:33] white Throne judgment look and I saw in
[1:02:35] the night vision behold one like the son
[1:02:38] of
[1:02:39] man same as it is in in Revelations 1
[1:02:43] one like the son of man came with the
[1:02:45] Clouds Of Heaven brother said bride of
[1:02:49] Christ that's who it is clouds of Heaven
[1:02:52] that's not clouds rank clouds that's
[1:02:54] people and came to the angel should of
[1:02:56] days and they brought him near before
[1:02:58] watch and there was given unto him who
[1:03:02] him one like un the son of
[1:03:05] man not giv to
[1:03:07] God you you got to get it straight in
[1:03:09] your mind right you talking about the
[1:03:11] one liking the son of
[1:03:14] man and there was given him who the one
[1:03:17] liking the son of man who is

[1:03:29] stand before
[1:03:33] it
[1:03:35] right and there was given him dominion
[1:03:38] and glory and a kingdom that all the
[1:03:41] people Nations and Lang languages should
[1:03:44] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[1:03:47] Dominion which shall not pass away in
[1:03:49] his kingdom that which shall not be
[1:03:52] destroyed there it is Daniel saw him
[1:03:55] with the about her he was a judge
[1:03:57] opening the books and judging out of
[1:03:59] them Daniel saw him coming in
[1:04:04] clouds that is exactly what John saw
[1:04:07] they both saw him exactly the same they
[1:04:11] saw the judge with his judgment girdle
[1:04:13] over his shoulder standing pure and holy
[1:04:16] full of wisdom fully qualified to judge
[1:04:19] the world in righteousness Hallelujah
[1:04:22] even the world understand this s symbol
[1:04:26] symbol symbology I'll pronounce it
[1:04:29] somewh for in ancient times a judge
[1:04:31] would appear in convening court dressed
[1:04:33] in a white wig and a WR long robe that
[1:04:37] signified his complete Authority head to
[1:04:39] foot to meet out
[1:04:41] judgment Daniel saw the same thing John
[1:04:47] saw one like unto the son of
[1:04:51] man comes to the Ancient of Days those
[1:04:54] are terminologies it's not one sitting
[1:04:56] over here and here comes another God we
[1:04:58] got to get this God and we got to get
[1:05:00] that God it's what I said if it had
[1:05:01] never been taught we wouldn't have that
[1:05:03] garbage cans in her
[1:05:06] mind it wouldn't have that if I get up
[1:05:08] to heaven don't find father son Holy
[1:05:10] Ghost I'll just Le cuz I'll be in the
[1:05:11] wrong place you ain't never heard
[1:05:14] preacher say
[1:05:16] that if You' listen some you'd probably
[1:05:18] heard a lot of them say CU they were
[1:05:20] firm
[1:05:22] trinitarians that believe there's going
[1:05:24] to be three gods
[1:05:27] no there's going to be a white Throne
[1:05:30] judgment there's going to be the Lord
[1:05:32] Jesus Christ in his
[1:05:34] bride sitting there and the Lord Jesus
[1:05:37] Christ will have the dominion over all
[1:05:42] things and that Dominion will be
[1:05:46] shared
[1:05:48] equally with his
[1:05:51] people you want a scripture
[1:05:56] I thought we were
[1:05:59] ours and join
[1:06:02] ours I thought that's what the Bible
[1:06:06] said that we were ours and join ours
[1:06:09] with who Jesus
[1:06:12] Christ so whatever he gets we get so we
[1:06:16] sat on the throne amen with him judging
[1:06:20] all the others right okay coming on down
[1:06:25] what are we looking
[1:06:28] at one like unto the son of
[1:06:32] man he goes back to Revelations 20
[1:06:35] there's where the white Throne is okay
[1:06:38] if they'll pull that up to paragraph be
[1:06:40] number two paragraph
[1:06:41] 275 all he goes right straight to where
[1:06:44] the white Throne judgment and all
[1:06:47] because that's Revelations 20 and watch
[1:06:49] what it comes down to do there will be
[1:06:51] both the righteous
[1:06:53] watch and the unrighteous ious in this
[1:06:58] judgment wait a
[1:07:01] minute righteous and
[1:07:05] unrighteous it says so these righteous
[1:07:09] will not be the
[1:07:11] bride because the bride sits in
[1:07:14] judgment First
[1:07:16] Corinthians who is the other righteous
[1:07:18] at the white throne
[1:07:29] you got your F seal
[1:07:31] you you got your
[1:07:35] 144,000 you got your foolish
[1:07:39] virgins that's why the Bible says as
[1:07:43] sheeps and
[1:07:46] goats it's not
[1:07:49] goats it's as sheeps and
[1:07:53] goats five wise and I
[1:07:57] foolish the righteous but it can't be
[1:07:59] the bride cuz she sits on the Judgment
[1:08:01] see the bride is with him in the throne
[1:08:03] as she is to judge the world she has to
[1:08:06] be sitting in the Judgment with him that
[1:08:09] is exactly what Daniel saw because he
[1:08:11] goes back to 3:21 he goes over to over
[1:08:14] him that cometh he goes right back to
[1:08:16] Daniel again and right just read
[1:08:19] it think about it
[1:08:27] Corinthians it says it do you not know
[1:08:30] that the Saints shall judge the
[1:08:33] world and if the world shall be judged
[1:08:35] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[1:08:39] smallest
[1:08:40] matter know ye not that we shall judge
[1:08:45] Angels how much more pertaining to
[1:08:49] life you know the bride of Christ he
[1:08:51] going to judge angels
[1:08:56] there'll be people standing before the
[1:08:57] white Throne that will be given eternal
[1:09:00] life all right they will be counted as
[1:09:04] the
[1:09:05] righteous because they will be made
[1:09:07] righteous at that point they have no
[1:09:10] righteousness until
[1:09:13] then all right you got a little
[1:09:16] arguments among it into the fal je and
[1:09:19] the 144,000 because remember the 144,000
[1:09:22] receive the same Holy Ghost you do but
[1:09:24] it just just does not make them Sons and
[1:09:28] Daughters right we don't care to get
[1:09:30] into the
[1:09:31] argumentative it's just talk about what
[1:09:34] we
[1:09:35] see do you
[1:09:37] realize this one that I've read over and
[1:09:40] over and
[1:09:45] over is going to show the white
[1:09:49] drone now why would you have any trouble
[1:09:53] as to her being liken to the son of
[1:09:58] man being the word made flesh why would
[1:10:01] you have any trouble with that shouldn't
[1:10:02] have all the quotes that I gave of the
[1:10:04] Prophet to show what he was talking
[1:10:07] about and how he was the one that said
[1:10:09] these
[1:10:11] things you shouldn't argue about the
[1:10:15] whether or not it's true you should be
[1:10:17] just simply believing it and saying
[1:10:20] thank you Lord for letting me be a part
[1:10:22] of it amen
[1:10:26] let me be a part of that that you spoke
[1:10:30] of because remember only those in the
[1:10:34] Bible that realize who they are are the
[1:10:37] only ones that amount to anything how
[1:10:39] many times I made that
[1:10:41] statement all
[1:10:46] right well then if you can see that you
[1:10:48] are the word it's the word that's what
[1:10:51] judges people it's not
[1:10:54] you Heaven Help Us we try to judge
[1:10:57] that's what Paul's talking about we try
[1:10:59] to judge somebody else when we got the
[1:11:01] garbage cans worse than they
[1:11:05] are you see why this has to go over
[1:11:08] there to show everything is taking a
[1:11:11] taken away from you and
[1:11:13] I when it shows the son of man then it
[1:11:16] is not because remember the quote that
[1:11:19] we
[1:11:20] gave is an anointed once in you remember
[1:11:23] the quote the other night no it's not
[1:11:26] not that I'll find it in my memory in a
[1:11:28] minute he said no leaven Among Us brings
[1:11:32] the fullness of the godhead
[1:11:34] bodily you know what leing
[1:11:37] is our old
[1:11:41] doctrines or any new ones that come up
[1:11:44] in the message
[1:11:46] with and when you come up with them in
[1:11:48] the message you just slow down a little
[1:11:50] bit and you can find out where they were
[1:11:51] back there
[1:11:56] you know that the two Soul Doctrine is
[1:11:57] based on identically the Mormon doctrine
[1:11:59] of
[1:12:02] pre-existence do you know that was back
[1:12:04] in the Baptist I believe it was they
[1:12:06] called it two seeds in the
[1:12:09] spirit would have been identically to
[1:12:11] the two
[1:12:12] Lords the two Soul
[1:12:15] doctrines because remember may I quote
[1:12:17] brother brandom all these doctrines
[1:12:19] never developed coming down through
[1:12:21] these doctrines was in geneses
[1:12:26] he said there's no such thing as a
[1:12:27] Doctrine start he said they started in
[1:12:31] Genesis where when Eve disbelieved
[1:12:34] Hebrews
[1:12:35] 13:8 that's your prophet's quote for he
[1:12:39] said she failed on Hebrews 138 well what
[1:12:42] do you mean brother we know back read
[1:12:45] there was a god back
[1:12:47] there and she failed to believe that he
[1:12:49] would do what he said he'd do
[1:12:53] right the Bible says L we fall after the
[1:12:57] same example of unbelief that Eve fell
[1:13:00] after just one
[1:13:05] word just one word just one
[1:13:15] idea that's why I'm so straight so hard
[1:13:18] I know when somebody say something to me
[1:13:20] I said yeah but that don't mat the
[1:13:21] word now show me if it does I I I I'll
[1:13:24] be be glad to repent and straight now
[1:13:26] but you you're going to show me in that
[1:13:28] word you're going to show me in the
[1:13:30] prophet's message you're not going to
[1:13:31] show me with your ideas and opinion cuz
[1:13:33] they don't mean a thing to me mine don't
[1:13:35] to you either it shouldn't mean nothing
[1:13:37] of our
[1:13:40] idea but what does God say
[1:13:44] amen I think you understand what I've
[1:13:46] done tonight I put it with the prophet's
[1:13:48] message and showed you the Book of
[1:13:50] Daniel and the Book of Revelation and
[1:13:52] and we didn't get to the 20th chapter
[1:13:54] where the white thron's at we just read
[1:13:55] it there but you read it cuz that covers
[1:13:57] it and it shows the same
[1:14:01] thing and Daniel saw one like unto the
[1:14:04] son of man just like John saw one like
[1:14:08] unto the son of man because it was
[1:14:10] identically the same
[1:14:12] position of the white Throne
[1:14:16] judgment what about before he ever
[1:14:19] starts into the ages to tell anything
[1:14:21] good or bad about him he shows the
[1:14:25] church already went to the white throne
[1:14:27] and shows her not sitting before the
[1:14:30] white throne but shows her sitting on
[1:14:32] the throne with him
[1:14:38] judging why wouldn't you believe that
[1:14:41] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:14:44] man the Lord Jesus
[1:14:47] Christ well now I'll kind of go along
[1:14:49] with you brother D if you'll keep that
[1:14:51] like in there now you got some reason
[1:14:53] for saying that that's right you're
[1:14:56] doubting the situation as being it
[1:14:58] because to me when I say like unto the
[1:15:00] son of man and I say the son of man you
[1:15:03] know for certain who I'm talking about I
[1:15:06] ain't talking about me and you because
[1:15:09] we ain't worth
[1:15:10] nothing we're not worth enough gunpowder
[1:15:13] to blow us to
[1:15:15] bits there's nothing righteous in none
[1:15:17] of us there's nothing in US worth
[1:15:20] anything it's all in Jesus Christ that's
[1:15:24] right and if you're not born again you
[1:15:26] don't have that position you are going
[1:15:28] to stand before the white
[1:15:30] Throne you're going to give a de count
[1:15:32] of the Deeds Done in the
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:35] body so no wonder the prophet would say
[1:15:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:15:41] most important thing in your
[1:15:49] life but you see we can go through life
[1:15:51] claiming we've got
[1:15:53] everything and wind up up not having
[1:15:57] anything I'd rather go through a life
[1:15:59] seeking after it and get there and find
[1:16:02] out it was already there amen and the
[1:16:05] finished product how many years have you
[1:16:08] heard that said it how long have you
[1:16:10] been around here I've been saying it
[1:16:12] ever since brother collie was here in
[1:16:15] 1972 I've been saying that I'd rather
[1:16:19] search for God all of my life and get
[1:16:22] there and him tell me so I'm glad you
[1:16:24] kept searching but said you had me the
[1:16:26] whole time I was with you then to think
[1:16:29] that I've got it and get there and he
[1:16:31] said depart from me I never knew
[1:16:35] you gu what Brother D I believe the
[1:16:37] prophet's
[1:16:39] message may I quote brother Brandon so
[1:16:42] does the
[1:16:44] devil
[1:16:47] okay now you got the old boy born
[1:16:52] again right if all it is is believing
[1:16:57] it
[1:17:01] say we'll get into those where it says
[1:17:04] to him that
[1:17:07] overcometh I'll Grant to sit with me in
[1:17:10] my Throne amen as I have overcome and
[1:17:13] sit with my father in his
[1:17:18] throne every age has an overcomer
[1:17:27] don't you think this is the hardest age
[1:17:29] of all ages to exist come on
[1:17:32] musician this is the age of the hardest
[1:17:34] of all
[1:17:36] things so then the Overcomer in this age
[1:17:39] remember what we what we were given out
[1:17:41] the other day I noticed I said it last
[1:17:42] Wednesday you know that ever age
[1:17:45] inherits what preceded
[1:17:47] them so everything we can cover through
[1:17:50] that church ages coming from Ephesus up
[1:17:54] to l
[1:17:55] oia we don't just inherit the lady oan
[1:17:59] word we inherit
[1:18:02] everything each Church age receives
[1:18:06] that's why this age then called uh ends
[1:18:10] in the basis of the Bride
[1:18:13] being the word made
[1:18:15] flesh the son of
[1:18:19] man the son of man let's stand what do
[1:18:23] we got brother 43 in the spiral
[1:18:25] 43 in thisp book anybody have a need cuz
[1:18:30] remember it's serious folks it's not
[1:18:33] playtime
[1:18:37] pry but can you really say
[1:18:40] today that within your
[1:18:43] heart that you are just
[1:18:45] as Earnest and just as
[1:18:50] Desiring just as searching after God and
[1:18:53] wanting to be with God
[1:18:55] as it was the day you
[1:19:00] started if not you
[1:19:13] backlit do you have that desire
[1:19:17] today that you had when you
[1:19:22] started or have you lost your desire
[1:19:26] and you just go into
[1:19:30] church it won't be long till things are
[1:19:32] going to
[1:19:36] change and when it does we're going to
[1:19:38] know who's
[1:19:40] who watch
[1:19:43] what we'll find it
[1:19:48] out when that World Council of churches
[1:19:50] starts coming after
[1:19:52] us and the they can come in many many
[1:19:55] different
[1:19:58] ways as a matter of fact if you'll click
[1:20:00] on I don't encourage anything but if you
[1:20:03] click on the
[1:20:05] website and you'll run it through there
[1:20:08] and you'll start looking at some of the
[1:20:10] things and you'll
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:14] find a man in there but the name of w I
[1:20:17] believe is his
[1:20:18] name not certain brother Joe can correct
[1:20:21] me whatever he knows it's on the
[1:20:23] internet picture
[1:20:30] no it's got Jim
[1:20:35] Baker selling
[1:20:40] eggs because the world is coming to an
[1:20:44] end and they want you to store up
[1:20:52] food all right I ain't got nothing
[1:20:55] against Jim Baker I'm just saying you'll
[1:20:57] find him on
[1:21:00] there this other guy says
[1:21:02] that they have passed so many laws and
[1:21:05] they've got everything in
[1:21:07] order I don't go by all these things
[1:21:10] that are said but it does make a
[1:21:12] sensible point he says they got it set
[1:21:15] now he gave the terminologies he said
[1:21:17] they can shoot one bomb on the Gul of
[1:21:19] Mexico and one on the east coast and on
[1:21:22] the west coast and he said they will
[1:21:24] never destroy one
[1:21:27] thing will not destroy a home will not
[1:21:30] kill a
[1:21:31] person but it said it will destroy every
[1:21:38] circuit you know all this light stuffs
[1:21:40] on
[1:21:41] circuits all these grids and all said
[1:21:45] it'll destroy every one of them and the
[1:21:47] man said it would take 10 years for them
[1:21:50] to be able to get it back together
[1:21:55] I'm not trying to scare
[1:21:58] nobody I'm just saying if you don't
[1:22:00] believe we're in the end you need to
[1:22:02] start listening to some of these things
[1:22:04] and pay attention CU I don't care about
[1:22:06] their dates and their times and Seasons
[1:22:08] he said it' be over with the end of this
[1:22:10] year you
