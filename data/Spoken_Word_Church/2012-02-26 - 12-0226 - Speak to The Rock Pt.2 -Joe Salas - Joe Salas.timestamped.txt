[0:00] not pick
[0:02] onebody I got a few scriptures written
[0:04] down over here so if you want to start
[0:21] with let's start with Exodus 17 1
[0:24] through
[0:27] 7 and I'm going to continue my thought
[0:29] on speak to the Rock since uh by the way
[0:32] going to be up there so I might have to
[0:34] do is speak to the Rock maybe 100 times
[0:37] or something I don't know one
[0:42] second okay let's start uh 17
[0:47] verse1 and all the congregation of the
[0:50] children of Israel Journey from the
[0:52] Wilderness of s after their Journeys
[0:56] according to the Commandment of the Lord
[0:58] and pitch in the Great
[1:00] Ria and there was no water for the
[1:02] people to
[1:03] drink where wherefore the people did CH
[1:07] with Moses and said give us water that
[1:09] we may drink and Moses said unto them
[1:12] what shall ye with me wherefore do you
[1:15] tempt the Lord and the people thirst
[1:18] there for water and the people murmur
[1:21] against Moses and said where is this
[1:24] that thou has brought us up out of the
[1:26] Egypt to kill us and our children and
[1:28] our cattle with thirst and Moses Cried
[1:32] unto the Lord saying what shall I do
[1:35] unto these people they almost ready to
[1:38] Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go
[1:41] on before the people and take with thee
[1:44] of the
[1:45] elders and thy rod wherewith thou smoke
[1:49] the
[1:50] river take in thy hand and go behold I
[1:53] will stand before thee there upon the
[1:55] rock in herab and thou shalt Smite The
[1:59] Rock and there shall come water out of
[2:03] it that people may drink and Moses did
[2:05] so in the sight of the Elders of Israel
[2:09] and he called the name of the place Mah
[2:12] Mar be because of the CH and of the
[2:15] children of Israel and because they
[2:18] tempted the Lord saying is the Lord
[2:21] among us or not
[2:24] amen last time I read a different
[2:27] scripture so this one's a little bit
[2:28] different
[2:43] the Masters that Rod take the rod and
[2:45] gather the people brother says
[2:51] uh and the rod that Moses had in his
[2:53] hand it was not the rod of Moses it was
[2:55] a rod of God God's judgment Rod Moses
[2:59] held it out over Egypt and flies came he
[3:03] held it out and fleas came
[3:05] up wherever he dumped his Rod it was a
[3:09] judgment Rod it brought judgment Upon A
[3:12] disobedient people and the rod was
[3:15] Christ the substitute for sin and
[3:18] sickness and Moses took the Judgment rod
[3:21] and smoked the rock to bring forth water
[3:24] therefore he said it was a judgment Rod
[3:27] of God that smokees Jesus and killed him
[3:30] the innocent one and brought him from
[3:33] him flow the Holy Spirit to the
[3:35] perishing people now that we may have
[3:39] life said no more do we Smite The Rock
[3:43] but we speak to the
[3:51] Rock I was just thinking
[3:58] uh
[4:01] he said U uh Moses wasn't supposed to
[4:03] Smite The Rock he was supposed to talk
[4:05] to them about the rock they need a
[4:07] little washing of the Water by the
[4:09] word I was just thinking if God was
[4:12] going to destroy them why didn't he just
[4:13] let them die in the desert of thirst but
[4:16] then the lord gave me the answer right
[4:20] away uh then God and Moses will stood in
[4:23] the Gap that's in
[4:28] U number vers
[4:31] 14 11 to
[4:41] 20 and the Lord said unto Moses how long
[4:45] will this people provoke me and how long
[4:48] will it be they believe me for all the
[4:50] signs which I have showed among them I
[4:53] will Smite them with a pestilence and
[4:56] disinherit them and will make thee a
[5:00] greater nation and migher than they and
[5:02] Moses said unto the Lord then the
[5:05] Egyptians shall hear it for thou
[5:07] broughtest up this people and they might
[5:10] from among them and they would tell it
[5:12] to the inhabitants of the land for they
[5:15] have heard that thou thou Lord are among
[5:18] these people and thou Lord are seen face
[5:21] to face and that thy Cloud stand over
[5:24] them and then th goes before them by day
[5:28] time and a pillar of cloud and a pill of
[5:30] Fire by night now Thou shalt kill all
[5:33] these people as one man then the nations
[5:36] with the heard the fame of thee will
[5:38] speak saying because the Lord was not
[5:41] able to bring this people onto the land
[5:43] which he s swear unto them therefore he
[5:47] has slain them in the
[5:49] wilderness and now I beseech thee let
[5:51] the power of my Lord be great according
[5:55] as thou has spoken saying the longest s
[5:59] long as longsuffering and have great
[6:01] Mercy forgiving iniquity and
[6:04] transgressions and by no means clearing
[6:07] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[6:10] fathers upon the children unto the third
[6:13] and fourth
[6:14] generation said pardon I beseech thee
[6:17] iniquity of this people according unto
[6:21] the greatness of their mercy and as thou
[6:24] has forgiven this people from Egypt even
[6:28] until now
[6:30] and the Lord said I have pardoned
[6:32] according unto Thy word I guess Moses
[6:35] was standing together say don't don't
[6:38] don't kill
[6:53] him in the message without money or
[6:55] without priz brother said what would be
[6:57] the children of Israel have given all
[6:59] the The Spoils of Egypt when their lips
[7:01] were bleeding when their tongue was
[7:03] hanging from their mouth they would give
[7:05] all the gold they spoiled the Egyptians
[7:08] for for one for one good cold drink of
[7:12] water their leaders of the Wilderness
[7:14] had led them from oases to Aces from
[7:17] ditches to Springs but they were all
[7:20] dry then there come there they come
[7:23] without money or without price said the
[7:26] voice spoke to the prophet and said
[7:29] speak to the Rock he said the driest
[7:31] thing in the wilderness the farthest
[7:33] thing from water their thirst was
[7:35] quenched without money without price
[7:38] said speak to the Rock not pay the rock
[7:41] but speak to the Rock just imagine he
[7:43] was trying to get water of this thing
[7:44] right
[7:50] here in the message uh making the valley
[7:54] full of ditches brother said said uh
[7:57] drin Gamble I'm going to kind of talk a
[8:00] little bit about
[8:01] water says drink gamble a lot of places
[8:04] allow the kids to smoke in the church or
[8:07] the school just before semester and so
[8:10] forth to quiet their nerves they ought
[8:13] to had a prayer meeting that's the best
[8:15] thing I know to quiet your
[8:17] nerves but you know hungry people has
[8:20] got to fill that longing with something
[8:22] he said if they won't drink from the
[8:25] Fountain of the Waters of Life the devil
[8:28] will give them a St ated sistern Wiggly
[8:31] tails in it it's not sister remember I'm
[8:33] not picking on you
[8:35] guys
[8:37] sisters in it that's right so they'll
[8:40] drink from
[8:41] somewhere say you'll spend that long and
[8:44] either on a devil or a God never was a
[8:48] person ever went to one of those places
[8:50] or done any of those things except it
[8:52] was a hungry hearted person that refused
[8:55] to drink from The Fountains of the
[8:57] Waters of living freely
[8:59] I tell you I feel sorry for them because
[9:01] of the let down and pollution our modern
[9:03] churches that's one of the things they
[9:06] related to the Social Gospel that people
[9:14] preach the water water is a type of the
[9:16] Holy
[9:17] Ghost uh Jesus first miracle was uh he
[9:20] turns water into
[9:23] wine now there's a lot
[9:26] of types and shadows with the the the
[9:29] Holy Ghost you know it could be a seal a
[9:32] sign all kinds of things you know
[9:35] so that's what brother said when you
[9:38] read your Bible don't read it like a
[9:40] newspaper he said uh if you if you don't
[9:44] find Christ in every verse you better go
[9:45] back and read it because you missed
[9:48] something it could be anything
[9:52] Eagles water whatever you know
[9:58] so
[10:11] in the message broken sister brother
[10:14] read the scripture on
[10:17] Jeremiah chapter
[10:20] 12 Jeremiah
[10:25] 2 Jeremiah 2 12 and 13 vers vers it said
[10:30] said be astonished oh heavens at this
[10:33] and be horribly afraid be ye very
[10:36] desolate said the Lord for my people
[10:39] have committed two evils they have
[10:41] forsaken me for they found of Living
[10:43] Waters and have fed them other sisters
[10:47] broken
[10:48] sisters that can not hold no
[10:51] water he said Israel had done two great
[10:54] evils God said they had turned him from
[10:58] turned from from him that P on a live it
[11:00] of Life had heue themselves sisters to
[11:04] drink out of
[11:17] it now this is what a sister is said a
[11:21] sister is a place a thing that's dug in
[11:23] the ground to take the place of a well
[11:26] where people doesn't have a well then
[11:28] they get a sister in other words a
[11:30] sister is a man-made tank or a man-made
[11:33] well in the ground that man they out to
[11:37] catch the water to use it some of them
[11:40] use it for wash water and some use it
[11:43] for drinking water and different way
[11:46] maybe all the water sometime that we
[11:49] used to get was on a system used to have
[11:52] an old thing you had to wind around
[11:54] around around to get the water up had
[11:57] little buckets on it to pump the water
[11:59] of a
[12:00] system well we notice one thing about a
[12:02] system that's different from a well now
[12:05] a SST will get empty the SST cannot feel
[12:08] itself it's not reliable you cannot rely
[12:12] upon a SST it has to rely and depend
[12:15] upon the rains and the fall in the
[12:18] summer or in the winter whatever it is
[12:21] usually in the winter time when there
[12:23] snow and rain comes then it runs the
[12:27] water off into the system if it doesn't
[12:29] get that water then you don't have any
[12:31] water it's all it's all dries up it can
[12:35] refill itself the only sister cannot
[12:38] refill itself it gets his feeling from
[12:41] the rains that fall he said I want you
[12:44] to know there's another thing of a sstem
[12:45] you usually find or the way it was out
[12:49] our place the system usually the barn is
[12:51] about twice the size of the house and
[12:53] they usually run the water out of the
[12:56] barn to the sister so every remember the
[12:59] old system while out
[13:00] there when we had when the rain pip rush
[13:05] into it often the off the barn it fills
[13:08] from the barn so then the water is
[13:10] carared from the roof of the barn where
[13:12] all the animals stepping around it
[13:14] through the Stables yard all the filth
[13:17] of the Barnard saddles on top of the
[13:19] barn in dry in dry times and then the
[13:22] water comes and washes it all on off the
[13:24] roof into a trough that's
[13:27] manmade then in into a man-made spout
[13:30] and into a man-made sister if you
[13:32] haven't got a MK I don't know what you
[13:34] got when you got a sister your sir it's
[13:37] all man-made and just as dirty as it can
[13:40] be you know we used to call we had a
[13:43] filter rag on one did you ever know what
[13:47] that was had to put a filter rag on it
[13:49] to catch all the bugs and things that
[13:51] come off the top of the root
[13:53] Barn all around the place and pour her
[13:56] from one place to another into the
[13:58] sister
[13:59] and we used to put a filter rag on to
[14:02] catch all that scum and stuff that we
[14:05] could course that would catch the real
[14:07] dirt that would not catch the real dirt
[14:10] he just cut the big missiles that came
[14:13] down and fell into it he said the bug
[14:16] might fall in but the juice of the bug
[14:18] went on with the
[14:20] water
[14:22] like he cut the bugs but the juice still
[14:25] went over the water so you were still
[14:26] drinking the
[14:27] juice
[14:29] I like that
[14:34] part so you really had a mess when you
[14:36] had an old dirty
[14:38] sister in a few days you let that water
[14:41] stand there and it becomes stagnant it
[14:43] you let the water stand in the sister it
[14:45] becom stagnant and it gets full of frogs
[14:47] and lizards and snakes and we used to
[14:50] call it Wiggy Tails little bitty I don't
[14:52] know whether they're not a par parasite
[14:56] there I cannot I don't know what to call
[14:59] them but some little thing gets in the
[15:01] water that they that we call WIIL you
[15:04] know what it is I me knows what I'm
[15:06] talking about I don't know what you're
[15:08] talking
[15:13] about good drinking
[15:24] water these lovers are stagnation comes
[15:27] with it it just actually comes because
[15:29] it's stagnant and because it's stagnant
[15:31] it draws the animals that they they like
[15:34] stag stagnated things you see that's a
[15:37] whole lot of uh our churches today I
[15:39] think that we have left one of the great
[15:42] things that the church has done today
[15:44] just like Israel then it left him a
[15:47] Fountain of Living Waters and they sh
[15:50] themselves at a manmade sisters and they
[15:52] became a habitation everything that
[15:54] loves that kind of water lizard frogs
[15:58] all kinds of unclean germs live in it
[16:01] because it's a man-made tank and in his
[16:03] tank these things stay a perfect simple
[16:07] of our denomination
[16:27] today
[16:32] same my message that's exactly what the
[16:33] people does today they refuse a word to
[16:36] take a Domin denominational system
[16:38] because in that they can do what they
[16:41] want and and get get by with it but you
[16:44] can't do it in Christ you got to come
[16:47] clean and clear in order to be in Christ
[16:50] leaving the Artisan well for man-made
[16:53] system or sister could you imagine
[16:55] someone doing that could you imagine a
[16:58] manal condition a person that could
[17:00] drink at a fresh arasan well and Rel
[17:03] leave that for a manmade sister with
[17:05] frogs and lizards and Wily
[17:19] Tails he said by the Fountain of Living
[17:21] Water gives it out free without pumping
[17:23] joining anything else I'm glad for that
[17:26] Fountain yes sir he need needs no
[17:28] strainer in it to take the parasites out
[17:31] for his coming so deep down there in the
[17:34] rock until there's no parasites there so
[17:37] they don't eat no filter no strainer no
[17:39] pumping no jerking no nothing else it's
[17:42] just there bubbling up they don't have
[17:44] to depend on local rains to fill it up
[17:47] he said rains are revivals where that
[17:50] Fountain that's a fountain Al but the
[17:53] carcass is the Eagles will gather the
[17:56] Eagles will gather
[18:01] you don't have to pump up a Revival you
[18:03] don't have to pump up nothing only thing
[18:05] you have to do is just come to the
[18:07] Fountain it's always full of good fresh
[18:10] water and there's no end to it it just
[18:13] keeps on
[18:25] bubbling now I'm going on water a little
[18:27] bit and no
[18:29] uh the flood talk about the flood and
[18:32] stuff and brother brother Dale been
[18:34] talking on U The Plan of Redemption so
[18:37] it's kind of I don't want to go into
[18:39] this message but I want to talk about
[18:42] water said in the future home uh brother
[18:46] said now the one that is the present
[18:49] world we live in now call it a world the
[18:52] old world that stood out of the water
[18:54] Genesis 1:1 now in a world that is now
[18:58] present and then again he refers to
[19:00] another
[19:01] one the world that is to come the new
[19:04] world three worlds three three stages of
[19:06] the world and notice how God makes his
[19:09] plan to us his Plan of Redemption oh
[19:12] this just Thrills my soul when I saw it
[19:16] how he makes plan plain to us here now
[19:19] his Plan of Redemption now compare with
[19:22] what we see with our eyes what God has
[19:24] done to redeem his world he's done the
[19:27] same
[19:28] plan to redeem his people for the
[19:30] unchangeable god changes
[19:33] not any of his plans or anything such a
[19:37] glorious thing how he led us to himself
[19:39] to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of
[19:44] Grace just like he's L the world in
[19:46] three stages come through the world as
[19:50] God will come to the world after it's
[19:52] gone through three stages stages of
[19:54] purification that's exactly how he comes
[19:56] to us through three stages of Grace
[19:58] I I thought that the thought that at the
[20:01] beginning I'll never change since it's
[20:04] since it's God's word he said you had to
[20:07] keep your threes together your sevens
[20:10] your twelves he say your number must be
[20:13] run perfectly on your you get your
[20:16] picture or else you'll be all mixed up
[20:19] if you can't understand it it just keep
[20:21] just keep praying you watch you'll cut
[20:24] right and exactly god is perfect in
[20:27] three
[20:37] he said now the anavian world he after
[20:41] he had repented but through the bride
[20:43] that day Noah he gave it a water baptism
[20:47] covered with water and justification
[20:49] show that he's on his road to call his
[20:52] Fallen World from Eden back to his
[20:54] restoration again then Christ came and
[20:57] shed his blood upon it cleansing it and
[20:59] claiming it see that's the world that we
[21:01] live in now he said see how Satan here
[21:05] in the scripture tried to make him break
[21:09] God's plan to receive
[21:11] it said he said give it to him when he
[21:14] took him up on the mountain tried to
[21:16] give it to him without purchase of the
[21:19] blood he
[21:21] said notice the baptism are for to
[21:24] cleanse it from sin from sickness from
[21:26] disease germs from sinners from the
[21:29] devil and all of his groups each to be
[21:32] cast out in the Lake of Fire Holy Fire
[21:34] from God and come down from God out of
[21:36] heaven and burns it up to make it ready
[21:39] for God to dwell in for God in the new
[21:42] world that is to come is to dwell in the
[21:45] earth CA you say God he dwells in the
[21:48] human heart because he and his bride
[21:52] come one and they go to their home in a
[21:55] new world and the same Plan of
[21:56] Redemption is used to redeem both world
[22:00] and the person that we live in he's
[22:03] talking about cleansing the Earth
[22:05] brother say it doesn't burn the whole
[22:06] Lord just the atmosphere the devil the
[22:09] sin and
[22:22] everything said uh no was a type of the
[22:25] remnant that scared over not that
[22:28] translate a bunch Enoch one man went in
[22:30] the Rapture Before the Flood came
[22:34] showing that the church does not go into
[22:36] the tribulation or anything in it you
[22:40] was transl translated one
[22:42] man oh the church may be a number but
[22:45] the bride is going to be a very small
[22:48] group they'll make up the bride now the
[22:51] church
[22:52] may I say you compare eight with one
[22:55] eight times less will be the bride than
[22:57] the church and the righteous scarcely be
[23:01] saved where will where will the Sinner
[23:03] and the ungodly
[23:06] appear those who know better to do it
[23:08] and go ahead and do it anyhow those who
[23:11] follow the rules of denomination instead
[23:13] of work where will they appear at you
[23:16] call
[23:19] Christians yet call Christians taking
[23:22] the name of the name of Christ he said I
[23:25] perfectly known was the type of those
[23:27] cared remember when Noah came out H was
[23:31] with him sin was still in there sin went
[23:35] right on over through the ark unbelief
[23:38] doubt went over in the ark carried above
[23:41] the Judgment but but Enoch went higher
[23:44] than the ark he went on into the
[23:46] presence of God but Noah went through
[23:48] and came out and there was still sin a
[23:52] type of the mum of the world's
[23:56] condition
[24:16] and the mess speak to the Rock said uh
[24:19] let's look at some people that spoke to
[24:20] the Rock let's find out what taking
[24:23] place the first man that ever spoke to a
[24:25] rock was a man that gu got tied up in
[24:28] some
[24:29] theology he made himself a set of fig
[24:32] leaves and he thought they would do just
[24:34] as good as anything but when he came
[24:36] face to face with God he found out he
[24:38] was naked what did he do he spoke to the
[24:41] Rock and the rock made a way escap for
[24:44] him the rock that was in
[24:50] Eden you see there was Noah another man
[24:52] who had preached and the people ignored
[24:55] and laughed at him one day he spoke to
[24:57] the The Rock and The Rock took him in
[25:00] the ark and tucked him away in his arm
[25:02] rode him above the storm and drowned the
[25:06] persecuting world yes sir he said there
[25:10] was a man named Daniel once he who was
[25:13] in The Lion then he went out into
