[23:25] the Lord shall rise shall arise rise
[23:28] upon thee and His glory shall be seen
[23:31] upon thee boy I'm so thankful for that
[23:34] tonight I want to talk about amen a
[23:36] little thought tonight we see a lot of a
[23:39] lot of things going on and I want to
[23:41] make a little simple topic getting used
[23:44] to the dark we see that's where a lot of
[23:47] times we feel as Christians we get used
[23:50] to the dark you know we are not here to
[23:54] get used to the dark we're here to shine
[23:57] light in
[23:58] dark I like what the prophet of God said
[24:01] in the message the great Shining Light
[24:02] in 1957 in Jeffersonville Indiana he
[24:05] said as
[24:06] Isaiah said this people set in Gross
[24:10] Darkness but a great light has shined
[24:13] upon them well we can say that to us
[24:15] that this message is shine the great
[24:17] light on us it says Grant Lord that they
[24:22] that there this prophecy might be
[24:25] fulfilled today in these hearts
[24:28] who are longing for you that's my prayer
[24:30] this afternoon give to them that peace
[24:35] that passes all understanding and gives
[24:39] them a perfect satisfaction can you say
[24:42] that in your heart tonight that you have
[24:44] a perfect satisfaction that they have
[24:49] met you and have talked with you and
[24:53] offer to you their lives that's all he
[24:56] asks us to do is to be to offer our
[24:59] lives back to him a living sacrifice for
[25:01] Jesus Christ is it a perfect
[25:04] satisfaction to us have we offered our
[25:06] life have we talked to him have we come
[25:08] to the place to where we say Lord
[25:10] Whatever Whatever It Takes father that's
[25:13] what I'm willing to do if I have to
[25:16] subject if I have to Forfeit Sunshine
[25:19] for rain if I have to whatever I have to
[25:21] do Lord whatever it takes I like what
[25:24] the prophet of God said in another
[25:25] message called the former and the latter
[25:27] rain Phoenix AR 196 says and we see
[25:30] these fearful sights of coming
[25:35] earthquakes tidle waves Falling Away
[25:39] gross Darkness heav High minded lovers
[25:43] of pre lovers of pleasure he said now
[25:45] that's all for the world that's not for
[25:47] the bride that's a sign for us that
[25:49] we're going
[25:50] home he said but the church has another
[25:54] sign he said oh that blessed called out
[25:57] sign he promised that there would be a
[26:00] latter rain in the church the church
[26:03] spiritual we see that in this Darkest
[26:07] Hour that we live in that God has sent
[26:09] us a great light to be able to see you
[26:11] know you know the prophet of God once
[26:12] Illustrated the man he come over to
[26:15] another man come over to his house and
[26:17] he' went down a trail it was daytime
[26:19] then he got over there and he fellowship
[26:20] with the with the family for a while and
[26:23] he told me he said well I'm going to go
[26:24] back home it got dark and he said well
[26:27] we can't even see your house from over
[26:28] here how you going to be able to get
[26:30] back he said there's a trail that I can
[26:33] follow seeing Jesus left a trail for us
[26:36] to follow the bloody Footprints of Jesus
[26:39] Christ and we have a trail to follow and
[26:41] I'm so thankful this afternoon that we
[26:43] have that trail to fall brother said
[26:45] it's The Darkest Hour the cooling off of
[26:49] the
[26:49] church have you ever noticed that it
[26:51] it's the coldest time and the coldest
[26:55] when when it gets the coldest is when
[26:56] it's dark the record temperatures are
[26:59] set at night not in the day right
[27:02] because the sunlight produces heat and
[27:05] see we see that Satan is trying to
[27:07] breathe his cold breath on us as
[27:09] Christians trying to get us relaxed and
[27:12] satisfied in the surrounding and the
[27:15] situations we're in right he's trying to
[27:17] get us to get would we like to say it
[27:19] maybe this way tonight that he's trying
[27:21] to get us to get used to the dark and we
[27:24] see that the people the church World
[27:26] nominal and the people around the world
[27:28] they got so used to the dark that they
[27:29] let a woman a woman raise up and and
[27:32] Proclaim that she didn't want her child
[27:35] to have to be subject to prayer in the
[27:37] school anymore so what did the nominal
[27:39] Church world do when they had decided
[27:41] when they had decided to to to heed down
[27:45] and to let people do what they wanted to
[27:47] do and they didn't fight against it they
[27:48] just got used to the dark they said well
[27:50] if she don't want it that's all right
[27:52] with us let's don't make a big trouble
[27:54] but let me tell you when you do that
[27:56] then you compromise
[27:58] with the devil lot of times around the
[28:00] message we see when people say well you
[28:01] know you know you know it don't really
[28:03] mean that it don't this and you that's
[28:05] just compromising that's getting used to
[28:08] we don't have to take a compromise we
[28:10] don't have to take some man's word we
[28:12] don't have to take some man's education
[28:14] or some man's ideas we can take the pure
[28:16] unadulterated word for this hour and
[28:19] apply it to our lives we can live a
[28:22] Victorious Life we don't have to cool
[28:25] off that's right I believe that's what's
[28:26] wrong with we sat around so long and we
[28:29] we don't we don't do what we should do
[28:31] but the prophet God said you want to get
[28:32] closer to God then read your Bible and
[28:35] pray amen and I believe brother said
[28:38] that's a shame said look at look at John
[28:40] Wesley's mother said she had all raised
[28:42] all those children and still Washed by
[28:44] hand and and had you know to use the
[28:47] wash TB on and raised those children and
[28:49] Tau them about God and said now we got
[28:50] washing machines we've got drives we've
[28:54] got cars we've got everything we've got
[28:56] microwaves and we're getting lazier
[28:58] that's right amen see that Satan
[29:01] bringing in soft living to get us to the
[29:04] place to where we're getting used to the
[29:06] dark but it's time for me and you as
[29:09] Christians to raise up against that
[29:11] Spirit of darkness and say his light has
[29:15] shined it's time for the bride to rise
[29:19] the glory of the Lord has shined Upon Us
[29:22] in this
[29:23] age not just any light the light of God
[29:27] has shined on us you ever notice when
[29:30] you're traveling down the road and right
[29:32] before when you're traveling and it
[29:33] starts getting dark a lot of times you
[29:34] fail to turn you you fail to turn your
[29:36] headlights on because why you got used
[29:39] to the dark you really didn't realize
[29:41] you didn't have them on see that's what
[29:43] the Satan wants us today traveling
[29:45] through this life that we live in he
[29:47] wants us to forget to turn the light on
[29:50] right Jesus is the light amen he is the
[29:53] way he is the truth amen and we need to
[29:56] apply this light that we've received in
[29:59] this hour to be able to make it back
[30:02] right we see they walk right in brother
[30:05] said they walk right in with their eyes
[30:07] just wide open as they can be stumbling
[30:11] in Gross Darkness it's not a natural
[30:14] blindness it's a spiritual blindness
[30:18] that they can't you can sit here and
[30:19] show them in the scripture baptism
[30:23] godhead serpent SE and they still can't
[30:25] see that's right but you can see it am
[30:28] he said blessed are your eyes blessed
[30:31] are your ears blessed is your heart cuz
[30:35] you're able to receive it that's right
[30:37] thank you but they can't receive it
[30:38] because they have no
[30:40] representation they hear it they
[30:43] recognize it but they can't act on it
[30:45] that's right they say I got that that
[30:48] can't be true brother said people who
[30:51] calling themselves we know that don't
[30:52] happen around here people calling
[30:54] themselves
[30:55] Christians women
[30:57] men smoking drinking going to cocktail
[31:00] parties wearing shorts bobbing their
[31:02] hair wearing makeup manicure he said
[31:07] what it's over what he said what
[31:10] manicure whatever that is over their
[31:12] face and walking right on walking right
[31:14] on don't have no
[31:16] fear I've never seen somebody you know
[31:18] they come out with this thing no
[31:20] fear but see another a plan Planet the
[31:23] scriptural way we don't have to fear
[31:26] that's right but they better begin to
[31:28] fear he said the fear of the Lord is the
[31:31] beginning of understanding
[31:33] wisdom that's right they don't fear him
[31:36] that's why they don't have the
[31:38] understanding we do see they're
[31:40] whistling through the
[31:42] graveyard thinking oh it's going to be
[31:44] okay but it's not going to be okay
[31:46] that's right they're fooling themselves
[31:49] they've been so polluted by Hollywood
[31:51] and all these things and they even think
[31:53] they got the Rapture down
[31:55] pack so they come out with Left
[31:58] Behind it's nothing like that right and
[32:01] that's all oh have you seen this have
[32:04] you seen that I said butn of garbage
[32:07] don't even line up to the word he said
[32:08] he'd come as a thief in the night what
[32:12] thief's going to broadcasting that's
[32:14] right he's not much of a thief right if
[32:17] a man told me he's going to break in my
[32:18] house I'd be sitting in there with a
[32:20] shotgun I'd be waiting on
[32:23] him I mean but see they don't even
[32:25] realize that it's all Hollywood see
[32:28] brother R said Satan changed his
[32:30] position he used to sit over there in
[32:33] Rome but now he's sitting in
[32:36] Hollywood he's got the minds of people's
[32:39] minds polluted he said the people are
[32:41] watching these things on TV it's
[32:43] training their mind to go through the
[32:46] tribulation oh my my goodness brothers
[32:48] and sisters we better be careful that's
[32:50] right we want our mind trained to go to
[32:53] the Rapture this message is training me
[32:55] for a rapture for
[32:58] in for in this message brother said is
[33:01] rapturing Faith this message is my train
[33:05] this message is my measuring
[33:08] stick brother said the flashing red
[33:10] light is the signals down he said his
[33:13] coming is at hand he said oh my Isaiah
[33:17] in chapter 60 he said in the second
[33:19] verse said Darkness shall cover the
[33:22] Earth and gross Darkness will cover the
[33:24] people he said that's exactly right
[33:28] didn't Jesus even tell him in his time
[33:30] he said you leaders are
[33:32] blind he said the blind lead the blind
[33:34] you all fall in ditch they're
[33:36] spiritually blind amen but we have eyes
[33:40] say I can go to the Rock I can go to the
[33:44] shepherd and he can give me some of that
[33:46] good oldfashioned Holy Ghost grease
[33:49] to rub in my eyes but said there's a
[33:51] spiritual cold on the church Satan has
[33:54] got that people's eyes so matted up they
[33:57] can't see right from wrong no more
[33:59] that's right they're
[34:00] satisfied but I'm not satisfied Brother
[34:03] Don my exceeding portion is in Christ
[34:07] not in this place not in this Earth but
[34:09] in Heavenly things in Christ Jesus right
[34:13] he said so many people are
[34:15] sincere called away in Creeds churches
[34:19] organizations having a form of godliness
[34:22] yes he said but deny the power thereof
[34:26] right he said one side has light and the
[34:29] other Darkness he said Darkness pressed
[34:32] upon the Gentile
[34:34] age we're living in the darkest age ever
[34:38] known to man but yet we're living in the
[34:40] most glorious age see how great God is
[34:43] he takes Satan's Satan's darkness and
[34:46] brings great glory to it right to
[34:48] himself he said because there has light
[34:51] has has
[34:53] shined
[34:54] arise Shake yourself off off and say
[34:58] Lord I have seen your light I'm willing
[35:00] I'm willing to walk in the light as you
[35:03] are the
[35:04] light Darkness everywhere on the Earth
[35:08] but the only thing that can separate
[35:09] Darkness separate the darkness is the
[35:13] light here's Darkness upon the
[35:16] Earth light and darkness has to separate
[35:20] and only one thing separates it that's
[35:23] the manifested word of God separates
[35:27] right amen
[35:28] separates it didn't say draw closer to
[35:32] or get adjusted to it amen say separated
[35:35] he said Darkness runs to the other side
[35:38] amen ain't you glad of that amen ain't
[35:41] you glad we serve a God and you you've
[35:43] never seen so many homosexuals claiming
[35:46] to be Christians I believe God can
[35:49] convert right I believe God don't reform
[35:52] them he transforms them you're a new
[35:55] creature not the same old person you was
[35:58] right and they say we're
[36:00] Christians never seen a time like we
[36:03] live in now s me everywhere that's right
[36:06] it's old preacher they lock you up for
[36:08] that I'm obligated to the truth right if
[36:11] I have to be locked up then lock me up
[36:14] you can't take Jesus from me hey I can
[36:17] rejoice in there just as good as I can
[36:19] anywhere
[36:20] else to think that he's found us worthy
[36:23] brother Aaron that's right to suffer for
[36:25] his name he suffered for mine and yours
[36:29] he became our sin that me and you might
[36:32] become his very righteousness we don't
[36:34] get have to get adjusted to it they say
[36:36] oh you know it's all right God loves
[36:38] everybody he loves The Sinner but he
[36:41] hates
[36:43] sin he'll never justify sin that's right
[36:47] he'll can cover it with the blood and
[36:48] take away that nature and that life away
[36:51] but he'll never conform to that he'll
[36:54] never get ajust when he said anytime God
[36:56] said it was an Abomination to do this or
[36:58] to do that it's always been and it
[37:00] always will be he said over in Malachi
[37:03] I'm the Lord thy God and I don't
[37:05] change but they're saying oh oh we got
[37:08] to make it a little softer I heard a
[37:10] Church of God preacher say one time he
[37:13] told my wife this and I want to use it I
[37:14] want to use it he said he said if I
[37:16] could just get the people in the church
[37:18] said I'd set up I'd set up Hast acts and
[37:21] banjos and get violins and stuff just to
[37:24] get the people in there what are we
[37:26] trying to do brother and said don't give
[37:28] them what they've already got give them
[37:30] what they ain't got Jesus
[37:33] Christ that's what they need they need a
[37:35] dose of the Holy Ghost they need to have
[37:38] that spiritual inoculation like Peter
[37:41] had he said I got the prescription all
[37:43] you have to do is take it right brother
[37:46] said I put it in pour it down their
[37:48] mouth and hold my hand on their mouth
[37:50] and they spit it
[37:51] out come through my hands cuz they
[37:54] wern't willing they didn't have the
[37:56] right ground for it to be planted in but
[37:58] we have the right ground we have the
[38:01] right
[38:02] ground what makes the the light of the
[38:05] Moon Fade
[38:06] Out the light of the sun right
[38:10] right the world shuts out the light it's
[38:14] like brother Brown said want to give you
[38:15] just a little Str for just a minute it's
[38:17] like brother Brown said he said the man
[38:18] said that he he' go in the house and he
[38:20] said there is no light so he went down
[38:23] in the basement went down in the
[38:25] basement he said after a while that man
[38:27] tting in the darkness so much that he
[38:29] become
[38:30] blind and you know what I was looking at
[38:33] that and a friend of mine he was talking
[38:34] about we was talking about you know when
[38:35] you go into this Cav and these cameras
[38:37] they got fish in there and they're blind
[38:39] but those fish wasn't blind before they
[38:40] got in there but you know what the first
[38:43] generation they lived in the darkness so
[38:45] long they adapted to it just like the
[38:48] mother of harlots she rejected the word
[38:51] of God and now her daughters are born
[38:53] blind do you know the Next Generation
[38:55] brother Donnie they don't have
[38:57] eyes didn't Isaiah speak up he said you
[39:00] have eyes and you see not ears and you
[39:03] hear not a heart to receive and you
[39:05] receive
[39:06] not this message either come to open
[39:08] eyes or to blind eyes that's right the
[39:11] Holy Ghost always does that amen ain't
[39:13] you glad you got eyes that are able to
[39:15] be open you wasn't born blind amen see
[39:19] they can't have their eyes on because
[39:20] they don't have eyes they don't have
[39:22] spiritual eyes because they've accepted
[39:25] the Creeds of man
[39:27] and even their children are born blind
[39:30] well my mama was a Methodist my daddy
[39:32] was a Baptist my grandma was a
[39:35] presbyterian I'm not knocking on
[39:37] denominations it's not the it's not the
[39:39] people it's the system that STS that's
[39:42] right that's right it's that sist that's
[39:45] so nasty where they clogged it up and
[39:48] get it in one little area and still
[39:50] letting that artisian will of the Holy
[39:51] Ghost work let the Holy Ghost I like
[39:54] what the man told Brother Bram one time
[39:56] he said you know what a he said you know
[39:59] what a what what a Pentecostal is don't
[40:01] you brother he said what he said that
[40:03] that's a Reformed Baptist oh my that's
[40:05] fill with the Holy Ghost and I said boy
[40:08] I like that I like that see it takes the
[40:11] Holy Ghost to transform me and you into
[40:14] new creatures in Christ
[40:16] Jesus and we see Satan is coming and he
[40:19] is sitting this is the only time he's
[40:21] ever been bold enough to set in the
[40:23] temple of God and be worship than God oh
[40:26] my oh he's sitting there sitting there
[40:29] claiming worship you know why because he
[40:31] was the chief musician he knows how he
[40:35] knows how and we call this stuff we call
[40:38] the contemporary
[40:39] music we see it creeping in that's right
[40:43] all it is is rock and
[40:44] roll hey I know all about that stuff cuz
[40:47] that's the Lord deliver me in that stuff
[40:48] I remember I went to this uh gospel uh
[40:52] book you know was a music store and I
[40:55] was walking around in there and they
[40:56] playing this and I thought my goodness
[40:57] boy that's horrible that's horrible she
[41:00] said boy the woman I said Ain that so
[41:02] spiritual I said
[41:04] spiritual spiritual I said you probably
[41:08] I thought myself you probably shouldn't
[41:09] have told me that she said don't take
[41:11] this oh don't just do something for you
[41:13] I said no it makes me want to go back to
[41:15] the
[41:15] bar I said it don't do it don't make me
[41:18] want to get on my knees and cry out for
[41:19] a better walk with God that's why the
[41:21] scripture told me you to try the spirit
[41:23] know whether it's of God or not there's
[41:26] good some good songs yes but you know
[41:28] what it's it kind of seems funny that
[41:30] we'd wait through the garbage can to get
[41:32] a piece of bread when we got all the
[41:33] bread that don't have to be fortified
[41:35] within the world or the Sten of the
[41:37] world that's right I like the
[41:40] oldfashioned sing yes down at the cross
[41:43] where my
[41:45] savior there where he paid the debt for
[41:48] my your sins that's the kind of stuff
[41:50] stuff is heartfelt we we was I studying
[41:53] on that one time brother Aaron I got to
[41:55] study on this and one I want I usually
[41:57] don't name names but I going to name a
[41:58] guy Michael W Smith and he writes a lot
[42:00] of songs but they asked him they said
[42:03] Michael W Smith said why why do you not
[42:06] put the blood and and stuff like that
[42:09] and mention Jesus in your songs that
[42:12] much he said well said I don't want mine
[42:14] to be an old bloody song and an old song
[42:18] like that said I don't want mine to
[42:19] conform to the people you know I said oh
[42:24] oh but the Bible told me you be not
[42:26] conformed right to this world but be you
[42:30] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[42:32] see they don't even think like God see
[42:34] we've let it come in and slip in our
[42:36] churches and make all these things and
[42:38] we don't even realize it the Beats it's
[42:41] a very dangerous thing you don't you
[42:42] look at the beat in the music BR Brown
[42:45] said he had that rock and roll he said I
[42:46] heard that in Africa before it become
[42:48] rock and roll don't you don't Satan
[42:51] knows how to receive worship that's why
[42:53] we try the spirit and see what so God
[42:56] not oh yeah you know I told her I said I
[42:58] told the woman at the thing I said that
[43:00] sounds like an old Kansas song I used to
[43:02] listen to I said all you did was you
[43:04] change the lyrics I said but the music
[43:07] and everything else is the same I said
[43:09] it's still motivating the flesh right it
[43:12] ain't motivating the spirit the soul I
[43:16] said we need something to change our
[43:17] soul not to get us worked up I said when
[43:20] I used to go to ball games I used to get
[43:22] worked up boy I screaming
[43:25] harder but you know what that didn't
[43:26] make me save that didn't draw me closer
[43:29] to God that's you know but said don't
[43:32] don't live no higher than you jump he
[43:34] said you jump high as you want to he
[43:36] said but when you hit the ground walk
[43:37] the walk you know what they're jumping
[43:40] Hing and screaming and they got them
[43:41] worked up in the motion and see what
[43:43] they don't understand it comes by faith
[43:45] right the sick sense see Satan has
[43:48] tricked them to depend upon the other
[43:50] five
[43:51] senses oh did you feel that I said yeah
[43:55] I felt Satan breathing on
[43:57] us I said boy that was a cold breath oh
[43:59] that made My Wo it just made me I said I
[44:01] feel Goosebumps but it ain't Holy Ghost
[44:04] Goosebumps that's the cold breath of
[44:06] Satan breathing on us getting used to it
[44:10] and we get accustomed to it in the
[44:11] christm said well you shouldn't preach
[44:14] and you know what they had Joel Olstein
[44:15] one time they had him up here I am
[44:17] naming names again you know they I
[44:20] forget who it was it Larry King
[44:22] interviewed him you know they said Joel
[44:25] how come you got the biggest Church in
[44:27] America he said cuz I don't preach on
[44:29] sin I said Woo a preacher he don't
[44:32] preach on sin I much a preacher woo I
[44:37] said he just told on his they believe in
[44:40] prosperity and I do too but the Bible
[44:42] says seek you first the kingdom of God
[44:44] and all his righteousness and everything
[44:47] else will be added unto you see if you
[44:49] don't get that three-fold cord wound up
[44:51] right when you get it wound up right
[44:53] it's not easily broken I'm thankful for
[44:55] that tonight I thinking for this message
[44:57] it show us these things theet of God
[44:59] said something in demonology
[45:01] 1953 he said dear God I realize that the
[45:05] sunset of this great civilization is Now
[45:08] setting he said way past spent that was
[45:12] in
[45:13] 1953 think about that my brothers and
[45:15] sisters he said the middle of the days
[45:17] are gone the evening Shadows are falling

[45:22] kingdom of God to take its place out of
[45:25] this gross Darkness

[45:28] realize I'm getting
[45:30] older every day he said let me go on
[45:33] Lord give me strength help me to tell
[45:36] this great truth everywhere we ought to
[45:39] be wanting to tell this truth instead of
[45:41] hiding back and said I'm afraid I offend
[45:44] somebody Jes said if you're offended in
[45:46] me or my
[45:48] words if you're ashamed of me and I'll
[45:52] be ashamed of you I want to be like the
[45:53] man had the little had the dream said he

[46:48] God will allow them to do things that he
[46:50] won't allow you to
[46:52] do amen we better think about those
[46:55] things right and then we do it boy we

[54:20] thickheaded we got a lot of thickheaded
[54:22] people around the message yes it says
[54:25] marked by stupid
[54:28] improvisions to ideas or
[54:32] Impressions imperess means not capable
[54:36] of being affected or
[54:39] disturbed don't affect them no more like

[55:08] you like Jesus said drop the
[55:11] Rocks drop the Rocks you without sin
[55:15] pitch the first load amen I'd like to
[55:18] say it that way look at Amos he seen
[55:20] gross Darkness it grieved him he said I
[55:22] was born a prophet or born in a prophet
[55:25] his house little Shepherd that anointing
[55:28] came on him brother Donny he went down
[55:30] there and told him said the same God you
[55:32] claim the serve will destroy you one day
[55:34] that's right they thought oh that mean
[55:36] old
[55:37] crank told them the truth thank God for
[55:40] the mean old
[55:41] cranks I'm glad somebody told me about
[55:44] Jesus right amen it ain't been a message
[55:47] of dos and don'ts it's been a love
[55:48] affair I think you're still a prisoner
[55:51] he said whoever serves sins still a
[55:52] servant of sin right ever serves Jesus
[55:55] as a prisoner of love I'm glad to be as
[55:58] brother Brown said a love slave to Jesus
[56:01] Christ I'm glad to be his slave see when
[56:05] you become his slave like Paul and Silas
[56:07] when they begin to sat down in that
[56:08] darkness when they sat in there in that
[56:10] old nasty dungeon locked up in Chains
[56:14] old Paul begin to pray it didn't face
[56:17] his relationship with God he began to
[56:20] thank God and they said five Silas began
[56:22] to sing boy they had a Revival
[56:25] so much that God shook the Earth caused
[56:28] the earthquake and it shook all the
[56:30] shackles off of them anytime you're in a
[56:32] time of distress or heart like the three
[56:34] Hebrew children when you come to that
[56:37] place when you come to that place see
[56:38] what it was when they throw into that
[56:40] fire brother Donnie they didn't smell
[56:42] like smoke neither did they have smoke
[56:44] no sins or no burn but you know what it
[56:46] did it released them from the things
[56:49] they was bound with so don't be scared
[56:51] of the fire that's your
[56:53] release I'm thankful for that tonight he
[56:56] has showed me that that you can get in
[56:57] the fire and the things that bind you it
[57:00] can't stand in the heat so Satan said I
[57:03] tell Satan come on with me follow me
[57:06] into that into that Pillar of Fire he
[57:09] can't do it that's right he's like woo
[57:12] my goodness scatter here comes the light
[57:16] but a lot of people are scared of the
[57:17] light right right Jesus said because you
[57:20] love Darkness more than you love light
[57:23] said you'll die in your sin you said you
[57:25] all right till the light come but there
[57:27] won't be no excuse over there that's
[57:29] right the light is coming light comes to
[57:32] bring wisdom to bring Revelation to
[57:34] brings understanding I couldn't read
[57:37] what was on these papers if the lights
[57:38] wasn't on I might try to but I couldn't
[57:42] read it that's right I mean but what
[57:44] about us that when God sent this message
[57:47] and shineing on this Bible man this
[57:49] Bible became such a new book I open this
[57:53] book up and I said my Lord I've never
[57:55] seen that I've read it over and over
[57:58] again he said but it's time to Quicken
[57:59] it to you son and it comes alive and I
[58:02] just have me a little old Revival you
[58:04] get revived by the word I like what what
[58:09] brother BR said about Daniel he said
[58:10] Daniel encouraged himself in the
[58:13] word instead of being discouraged he
[58:15] encouraged himself in the word you want
[58:18] encouragement the word will bring it to
[58:20] you I know when I've been going through
[58:21] something or having to going through a
[58:22] trial something I can open this Bible up
[58:24] and get to read B I find something and I
[58:25] said my there it is there's my answer or
[58:30] I can turn on one of them tapes and
[58:31] he'll hit just what I'm un like this
[58:33] just like I'm sitting there you know
[58:35] what I love about this message this
[58:37] message can transform you right into the
[58:38] presence of God you can sit right in
[58:41] there and he can do that he do that
[58:42] spiritual scan on you and say there's a
[58:45] problem Son Well Lord cut that thing out
[58:48] get that thing out of there right put
[58:50] that spiritual radiation on it kill that
[58:53] sin of cancer that sin of
[58:57] unbelief so give me an extra dose that's
[59:00] right I like sitting and hearing the
[59:02] preaching of the word for for hey Faith
[59:05] don't come by preaching that's right
[59:07] Faith come by hearing right
[59:12] amen oh we see that Darkness had come
[59:16] upon the Earth everywhere and it's on
[59:19] this Earth everywhere people say oh man
[59:21] I'm telling you man it's going to get
[59:24] better
[59:25] that's all I hear the world people say
[59:26] it's going to get better I said oh no
[59:30] better days are up oh here comes old
[59:32] gloom and
[59:32] doom I said no I'm just telling you
[59:36] unless you just get you get in Christ
[59:38] better days are for here for the
[59:39] believer that's right for the Christian
[59:41] but better days for the sinner is over
[59:43] with didn't David say I almost stumbled
[59:46] to see the wicked cross from all this he
[59:49] said had I not went to the house of God
[59:52] this is where we at this afternoon he
[59:54] said and then I I seen their end and he
[59:56] said boy my foot was Secure on this rock
[59:59] then he said I can stabilize cuz Upon
[1:00:03] This Rock Jesus said I'll build my
[1:00:05] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:00:07] Prevail I like what David said in Psalms
[1:00:09] 18:2 said for thou Wilt light my candle
[1:00:14] the Lord my God will Enlighten my
[1:00:16] darkness Ain you glad he send this
[1:00:19] message to Enlighten the darkness to us
[1:00:22] that we can see the darkness but yet we
[1:00:24] got light to see what's going on and
[1:00:27] realize it and to have understanding
[1:00:29] Proverbs 4:19 says The Way of the Wicked
[1:00:33] is as Darkness they know not at what
[1:00:36] they stumble amen but we see The
[1:00:38] Stumbling
[1:00:40] Stones The Stumbling Stones is unbelief
[1:00:43] that's right the disbelief brother I
[1:00:44] said that attributes are smoking
[1:00:46] drinking doing all those things he said
[1:00:47] but unbelief is sin right Paul said in
[1:00:52] Ephesians 5:11 he says and we have have
[1:00:54] no fellowship with the unfruitful works
[1:00:57] of darkness but rather reprove them and
[1:01:00] we see ministers in the pool pit are
[1:01:02] afraid to preach on sin now a lot of not
[1:01:05] you know I'm not saying around here but
[1:01:07] I'm saying you know a lot of people's
[1:01:08] kind of back because they're afraid they
[1:01:09] lose their
[1:01:10] crowd said it's a meal ticket for themra
[1:01:13] they won't pay ties said I'd rather
[1:01:15] drink Branch water and eat soda crackers
[1:01:18] that's right he said I'd rather have two
[1:01:21] real Believers than a church full of
[1:01:23] unbelievers that's right
[1:01:25] amen he said I'd rather have perfect
[1:01:27] love working through the church than all
[1:01:29] the gifts right think about that my
[1:01:32] brother and sister perfect love for what
[1:01:34] perfect love is there ain't no devil can
[1:01:36] stand Jesus said in Luke 1 verse 17 it
[1:01:39] said he came to give light to them that
[1:01:42] set in darkness and to sh and in the
[1:01:45] shadow of death to guide our feet into
[1:01:48] the way of Peace Welly you're talking
