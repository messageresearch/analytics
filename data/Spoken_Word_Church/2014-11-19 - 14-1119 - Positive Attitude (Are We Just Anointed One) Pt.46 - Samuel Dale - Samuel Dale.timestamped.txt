[4:24] in the house of the Lord if you like
[4:26] turning your scriptures turn to Matthew
[4:28] 24
[4:31] it will go from Matthew 24 to James 3
[4:35] Matthew 24 James 3 remember the many
[4:39] sicknesses among the people and things
[4:42] and all the all this old bugs going
[4:44] around just keep praying one for the
[4:46] other now remember the the Bible study

[5:05] William borlavon will be with us
[5:07] breaking for that service so remember
[5:09] each one got a good report from the
[5:13] stress test they said that I had no
[5:16] heart diseases
[5:18] we appreciate the Lord for that and no
[5:21] heart diseases you know they do confirm
[5:24] I have a heart
[5:26] no diseases of it so that's the main
[5:29] thing right but Matthew 24 in James
[5:32] Street
[5:34] the heavenly father we thank you for
[5:36] this night that you've given us that we
[5:38] can come together Lord and take a little
[5:40] time in the middle of the week and just
[5:41] sit down underneath the shade tree and
[5:44] and let you speak to our hearts and our
[5:46] lives we ask you to forgive us of our
[5:48] many sins and cleanse us of all
[5:51] unrighteousness and may your love be
[5:54] made manifest in each one of our hearts
[5:57] and our lives this night that we may see
[6:00] you living among us and father just
[6:02] remember the sick you said you sent your
[6:05] word and healed us and delivered from
[6:07] destruction so we believe it just have
[6:09] your way now and just let your grace be
[6:12] sufficient for all of our needs may I
[6:14] speak Lord what you would have me to say
[6:16] and close them out to what you wouldn't
[6:19] want to be said we love you in Jesus
[6:21] name
[6:22] amen Matthew 24
[6:28] I'm going to try to continue on a little
[6:30] bit on what we were on Sunday afternoon
[6:32] so then we'll pick up this part
[6:35] and fit it in here all right
[6:38] so you go to Matthew 24 15.
[6:42] when you shall see the Abomination and
[6:45] desolation spoken of by Daniel the
[6:47] Prophet stand in the Holy place
[6:49] whosoever readeth let him understand
[6:50] that we know who that is what that's the
[6:53] mosque of Omar right all right then let
[6:55] them which be in Jerusalem flee into the
[6:58] mountain
[6:59] let him which is on the housetop not
[7:02] come down to take anything out of this
[7:04] house we know that happened Titus in in
[7:07] ad70 right neither let him which is in
[7:10] the field return back to take his
[7:12] clothes and woe unto them that are with
[7:15] child and to them that give suck in
[7:17] those days we pray that your flight be
[7:19] not in the winter neither on the Sabbath
[7:21] day because the Judean heals were
[7:23] snowbound and Etc right so for then
[7:27] shall be Great Tribulation such as was
[7:29] not since the beginning of the world to
[7:31] this time no Nar ever shall be and
[7:35] except those days should be shortened
[7:37] there should be no flesh there should no
[7:40] flesh be saved but for the elect's sake
[7:43] those days shall be shortened now if I
[7:46] fail to get to that in a minute I want
[7:48] you to think about something
[7:51] what if World War one had not ended when
[7:54] it did
[7:56] you know they don't know why it ended
[7:58] what if World War II had never come to
[8:00] an end
[8:02] you realize we would been blown to
[8:05] smithereens
[8:07] why can't you connect that together then
[8:11] if he don't do something
[8:13] himself
[8:15] is going to blow everything and it did
[8:17] would have if it hadn't been for him
[8:19] getting it ready for us all right so
[8:21] think about that
[8:23] except those days should be shortened or
[8:25] should no flesh be saved but for the
[8:28] elect's sake those days shall be
[8:29] shortened therefore If any man shall say
[8:32] unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[8:35] believe it not
[8:37] for there shall rise false Christ and
[8:39] false prophets and shows show great
[8:42] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[8:45] were possible they shall deceive the
[8:48] very elect all right now to a little
[8:51] part to go with it to the pickup in
[8:53] James
[8:54] three
[8:56] and we'll go with verse 10.
[9:00] out of the same mouth proceed as
[9:02] precedeth blessing and cursing
[9:06] my brethren these things are not so to
[9:09] be
[9:10] got the fountain send forth at the same
[9:13] place Sweet Water and bitter
[9:15] can the Fig Tree by my brethren by Olive
[9:19] berries
[9:20] either of Vine figs
[9:23] so can no Foundation both your salt
[9:26] water and flesh all right
[9:29] let's just stop fresh excuse me let's
[9:31] stop there you may be seated
[9:33] all right now we Sunday we spent
[9:37] quite a bit of time covering some things
[9:39] and and I want to just review back just
[9:42] a little bit and then come up to where
[9:44] we want to talk about tonight
[9:47] and uh you know we saw that
[9:49] Sunday the real you
[9:53] the real you was what we were talking
[9:55] about
[9:56] and we were taken from
[9:58] you know the scriptures there where it
[10:01] says there's a a new heart
[10:03] and a new spirit
[10:05] you know and I'll put my spirit in you
[10:08] all right then we know that most people
[10:11] misunderstand that and they think you
[10:13] know a new heart and a new spirit and
[10:15] then they they think that's the Holy
[10:17] Spirit that's the way the prophet said
[10:18] it all right but he said that's not true
[10:20] he said then you've got to put my spirit
[10:23] in you
[10:24] all right
[10:26] now
[10:27] oh
[10:29] I wish we could
[10:32] understand one thing
[10:39] we uh
[10:40] talk about
[10:42] the new birth
[10:45] all right
[10:47] and it's so massively confused by the
[10:49] people of this message until now they're
[10:52] saying that brother Branham changed
[10:55] his point of what the new birth is and
[10:57] different things
[10:59] and Wade was bringing it out so
[11:01] marvelous the other day from there in
[11:03] the future home where he said I've
[11:04] taught three processes from the
[11:06] beginning
[11:07] well then where did he change of course
[11:10] they got it all laid out you know but uh
[11:14] the same people is doing that is the
[11:16] same people that were confused over the
[11:19] scripture of a new heart and a new
[11:22] spirit
[11:23] and then put my spirit in you
[11:26] now what do you think that means I want
[11:28] to get this off just a point see I'll
[11:31] give you a new heart now we know he
[11:33] doesn't take the heart out
[11:35] and put another heart in that's not at
[11:38] all
[11:39] all right but what does he do he works
[11:43] upon that heart to Mellow that heart
[11:47] to the point that it can be unusable
[11:51] all right
[11:52] and you know it's not taking it out and
[11:55] putting another in
[11:57] it's it's working upon the nature if you
[12:00] want to call it of that of that person
[12:03] and bringing it out all right then when
[12:06] it says to give you a new spirit
[12:09] well the prophet said you couldn't even
[12:11] stand yourself with that old Spirit but
[12:14] now what does he do did he take out your
[12:17] spirit
[12:20] and put another spirit in
[12:23] or do you just work upon the nature of
[12:26] it
[12:27] you know
[12:29] did he just work up on the point of
[12:32] of
[12:33] you know converting it
[12:37] but see we read you know
[12:40] he gave us a new heart
[12:42] boy I got a new heart back then you know
[12:45] and he says I give you a new spirit well
[12:48] oh yeah we got this new spirit
[12:51] go to my spirit went out and his Spirit
[12:53] came in
[12:54] well
[12:56] I I can't see it that way I'm I'm sorry
[12:59] if if uh if you don't agree with that
[13:03] that's your business but you know we can
[13:06] read the quotes from The Prophet to
[13:08] where he says these things but the
[13:10] people are not going to believe it
[13:11] anyway he says he doesn't give you a new
[13:13] spirit he said he just changes the
[13:15] nature part of that spirit
[13:18] all right he just works upon it
[13:21] he doesn't take it out and put another
[13:23] all right now when it says and I put my
[13:26] spirit in you
[13:29] all right now I thought we believe that
[13:32] that was the Holy Spirit
[13:34] you know all right
[13:36] and I thought now
[13:38] the Holy Spirit was the person of Jesus
[13:42] Christ
[13:44] in spirit form that would come into an
[13:47] individual
[13:50] and that it would not
[13:52] um
[13:53] take out
[13:55] as much as we think but work upon what
[13:59] we are
[14:01] to bring that Israel trying to do at the
[14:04] end bringing it to Redemption
[14:07] me
[14:08] and you you get all of these things of
[14:10] the two Soul doctrines and all kind of
[14:12] doctrines it goes in there and people
[14:14] trying to prove this point prove that
[14:16] point and simply missing
[14:20] the Simplicity of salvation
[14:24] and what we're here for
[14:26] you know I mean we we do talk about a
[14:29] change of the body that that mankind
[14:31] didn't talk of down Through the Ages but
[14:33] you know that they did talk of
[14:35] justification sanctification and the
[14:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[14:40] and they did teach that in the book of
[14:42] Acts
[14:44] right well
[14:45] well see then when we talk about and the
[14:47] prophet say you know we were saying we
[14:50] received the Holy Spirit that they did
[14:52] on the death Pentecost because there's
[14:54] only one Holy Spirit
[14:57] all right and the Holy Spirit being the
[14:59] person
[15:01] but do we lay on that as a person or is
[15:03] it just some spirit
[15:08] well you can be this a little bit here
[15:09] and Float over here and Float over there
[15:12] I thought it was a person
[15:17] now it's not the person of Jesus
[15:21] the flesh man
[15:23] that comes and lives in you at the new
[15:25] birth or wherever
[15:28] all right that's plain sensible you're
[15:30] not need a revelation for that
[15:34] you know the human fleshly man no it was
[15:37] the soul that was in the man
[15:41] right but that soul that was in that man
[15:44] according to the prophet was almighty
[15:47] God
[15:49] or else yours tied up in trinitarianism
[15:52] all right
[15:53] but see being the person of Jesus Christ
[15:58] not the person of Jesus to come and live
[16:01] in you
[16:05] it's not those type of things
[16:09] like I said we read I'm giving you heart
[16:11] oh he just took my heart Out Boy when I
[16:14] was when I was 20 years old I got a new
[16:16] heart I could have went down to the
[16:18] doctor the day before and My Old Heart
[16:21] would have been going boom boom boom
[16:24] boom but I I got a new heart now it's
[16:26] going on
[16:30] now really
[16:32] I hate to be that arrogant but that's
[16:34] just plain stupidity you know
[16:39] so then do we really know what happens
[16:43] in the new birth
[16:47] and what is a new birth
[16:50] and brother Branham would say it's God
[16:54] and you and are together now watch him
[16:57] as persons
[17:01] well that's what I argued with the two
[17:04] Soul people they were talking about two
[17:06] Souls you know before you I said brother
[17:08] Adam taught Two Souls after he was
[17:10] converted if you're going to teach
[17:11] anything
[17:12] the old Indian you know the white dog
[17:14] black dog
[17:15] when I said that wasn't his point
[17:18] you know
[17:20] as he's trying to explain the Plan of
[17:22] Redemption
[17:23] all right
[17:25] but now
[17:26] do you understand what I'm getting at
[17:28] now whether you believe it or not
[17:29] understand me
[17:30] because I I'm not responsible for for
[17:33] revealing it I can't do that
[17:36] I can only speak to you about it
[17:39] and try to do the best that I can with
[17:42] understanding that
[17:43] right which is very limited okay
[17:47] now
[17:48] then we got into talking about the the
[17:52] three Realms of the human being
[17:56] and we we showed you because I've done
[17:59] this for 40 something years
[18:02] that I saw it back then that brother
[18:05] Branham up until 62 basically taught I
[18:08] said basically because he interlaced the
[18:11] words
[18:12] because it was inner able to interlace
[18:16] back and forth all right but up until
[18:19] about 62 right in there on the uh you
[18:23] know speaking on the greatest battle
[18:24] ever fought up until that point he would
[18:27] cover body
[18:29] Soul spirit
[18:33] right
[18:35] but then afterwards he comes along
[18:38] through the opening of the word
[18:41] and I invite you to even listen to
[18:43] spoken words I mean the the greatest
[18:45] battle ever fought and watch him
[18:46] floating between Soul and Spirit and
[18:49] seemingly you know
[18:51] talking back and forth
[18:53] but he gets on into the message and then
[18:55] he after the seals is open and things
[18:58] what does he say he says body
[19:01] spirit
[19:02] soul
[19:05] all right
[19:06] well I've had him to say it to me you
[19:09] know people say well we've already
[19:10] correct that at he didn't have to
[19:12] correct it I said that 40 years ago I
[19:15] still say it today
[19:16] he didn't have to correct all of that it
[19:18] didn't need correcting
[19:21] he always
[19:24] gave the body
[19:27] five senses she tastes feel smell in
[19:29] here amen he always gave
[19:32] the second realm
[19:35] memory reason conscience imagination Etc
[19:39] he always gave the center Realm
[19:44] Faith or doubt not faith and doubt
[19:49] he gave it Faith or doubt
[19:52] greatest battle ever fall
[19:54] where he covers it
[19:56] and he covers it on
[19:58] when Divine love is is projected he
[20:02] talks about one
[20:05] sins
[20:08] it can't be two in there
[20:12] you can't have
[20:14] God and the devil in your soul at the
[20:17] same time
[20:20] now you can have God in the soul and the
[20:23] devil motivating this rest of you
[20:27] yeah
[20:29] but that's what I just read there in
[20:31] James
[20:33] a fountain can't give forth bitter and
[20:35] Sweet Water
[20:39] see something's got to happen
[20:41] all right then what is it see it's
[20:45] always been as I said he didn't have to
[20:47] correct it because he was right
[20:50] he just had his wording of the realm
[20:53] that he would be speaking up
[20:56] and he called it Spirit or he called it
[20:58] soul
[21:00] would you check it now and see if I'm
[21:02] right
[21:03] well you can come pick it up I just
[21:05] don't believe it well okay
[21:08] we'll be
[21:10] but listen
[21:12] he never changed
[21:15] right
[21:16] the senses of the realm that he was
[21:18] speaking of
[21:20] that is a great major point of being
[21:23] under able to understand the message
[21:27] it is to me now
[21:29] it may not mean a thing to you
[21:34] because we're going to get into it a
[21:36] little bit in here and I'm going to ask
[21:37] you some questions as we go along
[21:40] and to see what you think about it
[21:43] the Bible said it's the soul that's
[21:45] sinneth shall die
[21:48] you know it's your soul
[21:50] lives on after death
[21:54] your body your spirit is gone but your
[21:57] soul lives on
[21:58] right so which one is the most real of
[22:00] you
[22:02] you see where he would have been
[22:05] and that's where the people of the
[22:06] messenger see they take a quote
[22:10] and they'll they'll bring it
[22:13] and say well look at her I read you what
[22:15] the prophet said
[22:17] but they won't take the understanding of
[22:19] where it like I said where he would say
[22:21] Body Soul spirit
[22:25] but he senses is lined up then he'd say
[22:28] body Spirits oh
[22:30] in his senses is lined up you know he
[22:33] was a prophet
[22:34] but you know being a prophet he had to
[22:37] learn
[22:39] he used he used to say it if you agree
[22:41] with this one he said I used to think
[22:43] Jesus loved me and God hated me
[22:47] he said until I found out it was a
[22:48] self-sane spirit or person
[22:51] all right
[22:53] now
[22:55] in in doing it
[22:56] remember what we've done with the bottle
[22:59] and showing I brought them back out
[23:01] because I wanted to you know to use them
[23:05] again
[23:08] now this is one bottle
[23:10] but I got to show it
[23:12] with three bottles all right
[23:14] because they ain't but one of you
[23:18] all right
[23:19] now there we are
[23:22] without Redemption
[23:24] Body Spirit and soul
[23:26] lost
[23:31] now
[23:33] then by the new birth
[23:36] in the finality of redemption
[23:39] you come forth
[23:41] now that's the same bottle I just have
[23:43] to illustrate it
[23:44] you know
[23:46] but it's still the same bottle
[23:49] Body Spirit and soul
[23:51] when we walk off of this Earth
[23:54] Body Spirit and soul is going to be
[23:55] right
[23:56] would you agree with that at least
[23:58] so it's the same person
[24:01] but the person has went through
[24:03] Redemption
[24:06] it's not taking all these cups and put
[24:07] them up here put this cup in that in
[24:10] this one and no you'll never get the
[24:12] story because you can't come out with
[24:15] one
[24:16] and use one
[24:18] thing I can take a one cup and put the
[24:21] black in it pour out the black pour in
[24:24] the clear
[24:24] in one cup but that kind of get messy up
[24:27] here so if you don't understand why I
[24:29] use the two different ones but that's
[24:31] the same bottle
[24:34] all right
[24:35] now
[24:39] see you can't have
[24:41] in you
[24:43] in your soul
[24:45] God and the devil living together
[24:51] because God won't dwell in an unclean
[24:53] Festival
[24:54] well it's just lay in our dormant
[24:57] but it was eternal
[25:00] that's your two Soul doctrines
[25:03] well if it was eternal you didn't need
[25:04] salvation
[25:06] that's plain sense of what
[25:08] took care of that Jesus didn't have to
[25:10] die
[25:11] so that wiped out all Redemption and we
[25:14] were a messed up bunch of people
[25:17] but remember now
[25:19] if you don't get nothing out of the
[25:21] message tonight whether you agree with
[25:22] me or not
[25:24] I want you to understand one thing
[25:27] the soul came into being first
[25:33] so it's more real
[25:36] the soul is in being as real after the
[25:40] body and spirit
[25:42] is taken away in what we call death
[25:45] so the soul is the real you
[25:47] that was what I was trying to get out
[25:49] Sunday
[25:51] the real you
[25:53] that's what you are
[25:57] now
[25:58] if I don't even get into the notes or
[26:00] anything about it
[26:04] just remember what I'm talking about
[26:08] the real you
[26:09] Ezekiel 18 4 says All Souls are mine
[26:14] the devil can't give you a soul
[26:17] and that's what your two Soul people
[26:19] talks you know they will give you one
[26:21] God give you one
[26:22] all he had to kill was one the devil had
[26:24] because God already gave you the other
[26:25] and it was eternal
[26:27] you'd be surprised how much people
[26:28] believe that and deny the two Souls all
[26:32] right
[26:34] your soul was made up before the
[26:36] foundation of the world
[26:40] all right you want to read it
[26:45] demonology
[26:49] but your souls were made up before the
[26:51] foundation of the world when God created
[26:54] man in his own image
[26:57] Spirit of man
[26:59] not a man in his own image
[27:04] it's not m-a-n
[27:06] if you'll check the original used to be
[27:08] in the book not m-a-n
[27:12] not man
[27:13] in his own image but man in his own
[27:16] image
[27:19] not man
[27:21] this is not the image of God this is the
[27:25] image of the Beast
[27:27] the soul of man
[27:32] came first
[27:34] all right
[27:38] and as he did
[27:42] according to my understanding
[27:45] if I'm wrong I'd like to correct me but
[27:49] I thought that
[27:52] that man
[27:54] was in the garden
[27:57] that soul
[28:00] that man
[28:02] was in the garden to lead the animals
[28:06] before
[28:08] he was put in human flesh
[28:15] now that's my understanding I don't know
[28:18] what you've got
[28:19] and I'll be glad to show you all of
[28:21] these things in the prophet's message
[28:27] but see we think about the soul of man
[28:29] as not being
[28:31] now we're going to get to this in a
[28:33] minute so we'll use it the two Soul
[28:35] people said the soul is just the nature
[28:39] of the spirit
[28:41] there is no quote for that in brother
[28:43] Reynolds message
[28:45] I want to hear it if it's dark
[28:47] he never says the soul is just the
[28:50] nature of the spirit
[28:53] because that would mean it's just
[28:54] anything it could just be this or it can
[28:56] be that it can be anything
[28:58] he always said to soul is the nature of
[29:00] the spirit well that's just being
[29:02] technical well then okay the next time
[29:05] you want to get baptized I'll baptize
[29:07] you and father son the Holy Ghost
[29:12] okay
[29:15] do you understand what I'm getting at
[29:17] we're going to be technical let's be
[29:19] technical because if not let's go back
[29:21] to our trinitarian Doctrine
[29:27] but not think about it
[29:31] soul is the nature of the spirit
[29:38] now what about where he says the spirit
[29:40] is the nature of the Soul
[29:50] now you just got some nature or some
[29:52] form you got cats and dogs with natures
[29:56] bird dog
[29:58] hound dog
[29:59] bird dog points hound dog don't
[30:03] you just got Nature's
[30:06] right
[30:09] now with our understanding and with the
[30:12] illustration of the the two bottles one
[30:16] being
[30:17] an unsaved person the other one being a
[30:20] saved person I wrote a random used in in
[30:22] uh
[30:23] future home where he said draw the heart
[30:25] he draw two hearts but to me that's the
[30:28] same heart this heart had everything in
[30:31] it garbage you know and a sin and this
[30:33] and over here had to dove that's before
[30:35] your salvation and after your salvation
[30:38] well he never said it was one
[30:41] hey
[30:43] I'm glad you're able to read
[30:46] but are you able to listen to the Holy
[30:48] Spirit
[30:50] what about that
[30:53] because you see the way
[30:55] that we look at it
[30:59] we look at
[31:02] the spirit if you don't make that to sin
[31:05] around you know the older quotes
[31:08] the new parts you don't want to make it
[31:10] soul
[31:11] we still just say it's the nature of the
[31:14] spirit or nature of the Soul
[31:19] now
[31:21] what makes
[31:24] a bird dog point
[31:27] when it doesn't have to be trained
[31:30] you understand you've got to train it to
[31:32] do the right and to do everything right
[31:33] but it's automatically born
[31:36] you've ever around dogs automatically
[31:38] born
[31:39] you know
[31:42] to point
[31:47] we said well that's his nature
[31:50] well now you've got the hound dog
[31:54] that he likes to run rabbits and
[31:57] true raccoons and Chase possums and damn
[32:01] but he don't point he don't stand at the
[32:04] bottom of the triangle
[32:08] why
[32:10] because that's not his nature
[32:15] are you Gideon
[32:17] his nature is just to chase the animals
[32:21] and you don't have to train them to do
[32:22] that
[32:24] right
[32:27] yeah
[32:29] when you're thinking about Soul being
[32:31] the nature
[32:35] of the spirit or spirit being of nature
[32:38] so what are you thinking about
[32:44] well it's just the nature
[32:48] because either ones you want to put what
[32:50] you're talking about
[32:51] you know it comes out to the same word
[32:53] right soul nature the spirit Spirit
[32:55] nature of Soul comes back to the one
[32:57] place that you're looking at something
[33:01] and whatever you're looking at
[33:03] is the nature of that whether you want
[33:06] to call it Spirit or whether you want to
[33:07] call it soul
[33:11] and you're looking at it as a
[33:13] just what it does
[33:18] huh
[33:24] now why do we get to the end of the
[33:26] message which I'm sure it'll be Sunday
[33:28] but
[33:30] you know the prophet talked about
[33:31] anointed ones
[33:37] now if the Holy Spirit had not corrected
[33:39] his language
[33:42] where would he have been
[33:45] when he tried to preach souls in prison
[33:48] he would have been preaching Spirits in
[33:49] prison
[33:53] and he couldn't have got it lined up
[34:00] now
[34:02] our bodies are pretty real
[34:06] we dwell on that
[34:11] but you know
[34:12] the spirit within that body
[34:15] the body is worth nothing by itself
[34:18] right right it can't do anything right
[34:24] even the sea taste feel smelling here
[34:27] will not work unless there's a spirit
[34:29] inside of the body
[34:32] agreed
[34:34] all right
[34:36] now so
[34:38] of what we think of the body being real
[34:44] but the spirit is what motivates that
[34:46] body
[34:50] but is that Spirit that's within us just
[34:52] a spirit
[34:55] you know
[34:56] something floating around
[34:59] and we look over there our hours of
[35:01] spirit
[35:03] remember you can't see a spirit right
[35:06] unless it makes itself manifest through
[35:10] some natural form
[35:13] and that's what everybody's scared of
[35:15] they're scared to go walking down
[35:17] through a graveyard
[35:21] the fear is not in the graveyard
[35:24] the fears in you
[35:27] his brother Harris said the best place
[35:29] for them to go at night and get a good
[35:31] night's rest you know where it was at
[35:33] right down in the middle of the
[35:35] graveyard he said because them people
[35:38] were scared of them spirits in the dark
[35:40] and it wouldn't come in the graveyard
[35:43] huh
[35:45] but you know there's never been a spirit
[35:47] able to hurt anybody right
[35:50] right it may make you hurt yourself
[35:53] it may make you hurt somebody else
[35:56] but that Spirit can't hurt you
[35:59] it's just a spirit
[36:02] but see that's where we get tied up with
[36:04] making then
[36:07] the third room of man
[36:10] whether you want to call it Spirit or
[36:12] what do you want to call it soul
[36:14] we want to make that as just some
[36:16] Spirit be in or something
[36:21] when we just
[36:23] read where the Prophet said
[36:26] the Bible says All Souls are mine
[36:29] the prophet said All Souls were made up
[36:32] before the world
[36:34] well that's pre-existence brother Dale
[36:37] well that's pre whatever your Prophet
[36:39] said
[36:41] right
[36:42] you want to argue with him
[36:46] and we can go back and cover how that
[36:48] that was in the mind of God and spend
[36:51] great lengthy discusses upon it
[36:52] discussions upon it to get it right but
[36:55] I think we ought to be having it about
[36:57] right by now
[36:58] you know after all of these years
[37:00] that we've had to study the message
[37:04] I think I want to know a little bit
[37:07] what are you trying to say brother Dale
[37:10] I'm trying my best to tell you
[37:12] that that Soul that's within you is more
[37:15] real
[37:17] than that body
[37:18] that I'm looking at
[37:20] or that reaction of a spirit within you
[37:23] to cause you to raise your hands or to
[37:25] do or whatever or on a rare occasion Say
[37:28] Amen
[37:36] because you see the soul is going to
[37:38] live on after we're gone into the ground
[37:44] and the Soul has to be destroyed
[37:46] the soul that sentence that shall die
[37:48] doesn't say the spirit of sinneth didn't
[37:49] say that so look where the Prophet would
[37:51] have been had he kept covering the
[37:53] center Realm
[37:54] and spirit
[37:59] well what did that matter
[38:01] it mattered enough until God corrected
[38:04] him
[38:06] and you show me after the seals broke
[38:09] where he was talking about Body Spirit
[38:12] Body Soul spirit
[38:14] no you'll find it Body Spirit and soul
[38:19] he had it in the right order
[38:23] but if you don't get nothing out of the
[38:24] message or not remember I'm talking
[38:26] about the soul of mankind as being more
[38:31] real than anything you can tangibly
[38:33] think about
[38:39] right
[38:42] see it's real
[38:46] I can cut your head off that'll deliver
[38:48] your spirit in your body
[38:50] but your soul will live on
[38:53] now but I remind you we will get to this
[38:58] the bread of random beyond the curtain
[39:00] of time
[39:03] he calls that Souls under the altar
[39:08] he calls it theophany
[39:12] and you know he could feel in people
[39:20] come on
[39:22] they hugged him
[39:30] but see that's where you separate soul
[39:33] and theophany say you want to do that
[39:35] and try to put this way off up you under
[39:36] somewhere
[39:38] you got your problem
[39:42] but now I want you to think about one
[39:44] individual
[39:48] and saying the soul is the nature of the
[39:50] spirit
[39:51] you know that's right
[39:53] that's what I showed you with a bottle
[39:57] that is an unregenerated person
[40:00] his soul is the nature of his Spirit or
[40:03] his spirit is the nature of his soul
[40:05] because why because the whole individual
[40:08] is lost
[40:13] right
[40:14] So when you say soul is the nature of
[40:16] the Spirit Well I'm going to say
[40:18] spirit's the nature of the Soul
[40:20] it doesn't bother me because it's one
[40:22] individual
[40:27] then when it's converted
[40:30] you don't leave them up there together
[40:34] that's two
[40:35] and last time I counted anyway
[40:38] you know
[40:40] but you got that
[40:42] and you know what that is
[40:45] a born-again Believer as I said ready
[40:47] for the Rapture because I did tell you
[40:50] we still have some problems
[40:53] with the body and spirit
[40:55] if you can see the lines around the side
[40:58] the body and spirit is what's giving us
[41:00] our trouble but one day when we leave
[41:02] out of here it's going to be that
[41:05] but you know what this is
[41:08] a born-again experience inside and there
[41:10] ain't no devil in there
[41:16] so whatever is inside of you
[41:19] wants to come outside
[41:22] but we're human
[41:24] and we have troubles all right
[41:28] but then I can say the soul is the
[41:30] nature of the spirit why
[41:32] because
[41:34] or say the spiritual nature of the Soul
[41:36] wherever you put it at just remember to
[41:38] put three rims
[41:41] one two three
[41:45] adiram second rim
[41:48] surgery
[41:52] whatever you want to call these
[41:55] if you want to be to where you can't
[41:57] stand it though it's got to be sold you
[42:00] know
[42:00] body souls and spirit
[42:03] well
[42:05] just remember
[42:07] whatever is on the inside of you
[42:11] is displayed out through the second rim
[42:14] of memory reason conscience affections
[42:18] whatever you want to call that
[42:21] and it's displayed through sea taste
[42:24] field smelling here right
[42:27] right if you want to say the soul is the
[42:29] nature of the spirit fine with me
[42:32] because you're saying that whatever is
[42:35] inside of you
[42:39] is coming outwardly if you want to say
[42:41] spirits of nature of the Soul
[42:44] whatever you're calling the center Realm
[42:47] that's what's in charge
[42:50] on the prophet one greatest battle ever
[42:51] fought said it dominates you that's
[42:54] right
[42:56] all right so it's not Faith or doubt
[42:58] right
[42:59] it's doubt before the New Birth it's
[43:01] Faith after the New Birth
[43:03] and then that Soul within there
[43:06] the way I believe it
[43:09] it works back out through my spirit
[43:13] but my spirit is not born again
[43:19] another way I'm saying it Body Spirit
[43:22] soul
[43:23] because I'm lining it up to where I can
[43:26] talk about anointed ones
[43:28] because if you talk about anointed ones
[43:31] with the early quotes from Brother
[43:33] Branham
[43:36] you got a problem
[43:39] but you're too dumb to think about it or
[43:42] consider it
[43:44] excuse me for that language but there's
[43:46] one thing about it you don't wonder what
[43:48] I mean
[43:50] right
[43:52] so you say well it's just a spirit
[43:59] where are you going to make the soul is
[44:00] just a spirit
[44:02] where are you going to make the interim
[44:04] of mankind this is some spirit
[44:13] you can't do it
[44:15] you got a problem
[44:17] you're just getting a replacement of
[44:19] things
[44:24] do you understand
[44:27] see then if the spirit is the center
[44:29] Realm then where are you going to go
[44:31] over to where brother Brandon says that
[44:34] the anointing
[44:36] is on the spirit
[44:40] so that put the anointing inside
[44:44] you're going to swap women now he said
[44:46] you're going to be happy to jump back
[44:48] out
[44:49] because
[44:51] see
[44:53] you're going to have the soul a problem
[44:54] then
[44:57] you can't just keep saying well it's
[44:59] just the nature of it
[45:03] you get it
[45:05] you're gonna have to make up your mind
[45:06] one way or the other
[45:08] but if you hold a point
[45:11] that the spirit is the center Realm
[45:14] when you come to anointed ones
[45:17] you're going to be putting that
[45:19] anointing into the center Realm
[45:22] and that gives you the new birth
[45:25] and it won't be anointed ones
[45:29] it'll be the anointed one
[45:34] yeah you see what I'm getting here
[45:37] yeah but this is the way I believe it
[45:38] well that's all right play what you want
[45:40] to I'm just saying
[45:42] that if you're listening you're
[45:45] understanding
[45:47] that when you say the soul is the nature
[45:49] of the spirit
[45:53] putting the spirit in the center
[45:56] stole the second realm
[45:58] the body outside
[46:00] then when you come to anointed ones you
[46:02] got a problem
[46:03] because you're going to be giving them
[46:04] the new birth
[46:06] we'll run around and says you can have
[46:08] the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit
[46:11] on your spirit
[46:14] and be lost
[46:20] so you better get your senses lined up
[46:26] and get the fire for the body and to
[46:29] fight for the second realm
[46:31] into one sense for the center Realm
[46:34] and get it lined up Body Spirit and soul
[46:41] see then you can make the center realm
[46:43] to be the right one
[46:46] all right
[46:50] see what my point is whatever is on the
[46:53] inside
[46:56] is going to work outwardly
[46:59] so when we were lost the devil was on
[47:02] the inside
[47:04] he was the one kin folks to us right
[47:06] according to the Book of Ruth
[47:10] and God had to come down to be kin folks
[47:12] to us
[47:13] to take away that
[47:16] deal that Satan had on us
[47:20] because see I don't have to make many
[47:22] different drawings
[47:23] I can understand
[47:25] what the new birth is
[47:29] ever what you do of the new birth you've
[47:32] got to put God in the center Realm
[47:40] but just because you're born again
[47:42] doesn't make your memory reason
[47:45] conscience
[47:47] you don't get a birth in that we need
[47:49] one
[47:50] I agree with brother Lee Vale when he
[47:52] said we need a baptism when the Holy
[47:54] Ghost on our brain I agree
[47:59] but I don't know if it ever coming
[48:04] what are you listening now
[48:08] see that inside of you
[48:11] is the real you
[48:17] more real
[48:22] anything you could think of because it
[48:24] came into being
[48:27] if you want to call it God's mind
[48:28] whatever you want to do it that's fine
[48:30] but he was the one that said
[48:34] that those Souls were made up
[48:39] when God said let us make man
[48:43] all right
[48:45] so when he made it up he
[48:49] he made a soul
[48:52] right
[48:54] now let me run real fast if I can go to
[48:57] number two
[48:59] this is the cruelty of seeing 19 in 53.
[49:04] and look what he says
[49:10] made him out of the Dust of the Earth
[49:12] now not in his own image
[49:15] it already made the man
[49:17] what
[49:18] did he breathe into him the Breath of
[49:20] Life
[49:21] and he became a living
[49:23] soul
[49:28] now therefore the 99 of the people the
[49:30] message today believe you come here with
[49:32] eternal life
[49:34] but I don't believe that I believe we
[49:36] need a new birth
[49:38] and to do that you must go through
[49:40] justification sanctification and the
[49:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost brings eternal
[49:45] life now that's what I believe
[49:48] all right
[49:49] but look and he breathed into him the
[49:51] breath of life and he became a living
[49:53] Soul sold the soul of the man of man is
[49:56] the nature of the spirit
[50:01] now watch when you're born when you're
[50:03] reborn you don't get a new spirit
[50:07] watch him
[50:09] you get a new nature of that spirit
[50:15] it's the same spirit
[50:17] but a new nature of it you take two men
[50:20] stand them together both look alike one
[50:23] of them is a sinner the other one is a
[50:25] Christian one man said I got a spirit in
[50:29] the same as you have
[50:32] okay
[50:33] but one of them is different his soul
[50:37] his nature is different he's been
[50:40] changed
[50:48] I want to keep emphasizing one thing
[50:52] there's a lot of difference between a
[50:53] spirit
[50:55] and a soul
[51:01] a spirit
[51:03] Works through your brain
[51:05] has to
[51:06] to make your sea taste feel smell in
[51:09] your work
[51:11] but it works through your brain in your
[51:13] memory your reason your conscience and
[51:15] things
[51:17] and it's the spirit within you
[51:21] that soul is the real you
[51:26] and if you could some way take that soul
[51:28] out of that individual and stand it
[51:31] right here
[51:33] do you know what it looked like
[51:37] it looked like you
[51:39] not 70 now come on we got a little more
[51:42] sense
[51:46] it would look like a 20 year old man but
[51:49] it'd be me
[51:51] and you know what if God allowed your
[51:53] eyesight to be able to be moved and the
[51:56] things to happen you could see me
[51:59] you could feel me you could talk to me
[52:02] when brother random went beyond the
[52:03] curtain of time
[52:09] he was there with people
[52:12] that had senses I've even told you
[52:15] before about it see that was where years
[52:16] ago that I was wrong
[52:19] and I've told you because I'd always
[52:21] seek theophany and soul but see no
[52:24] senses
[52:29] but yet brother Brown does emphasize one
[52:31] thing he says in that theophany beyond
[52:34] the curtain of time they said we don't
[52:36] eat
[52:40] but he said they had all the senses
[52:46] now watch when we get to it where Jesus
[52:48] went to hell and preached to the souls
[52:52] now what's in the need of preaching to a
[52:53] bunch of spirits that are just floating
[52:56] around us you can't do nothing with them
[52:58] you know that when he went to hell he
[53:01] saw people
[53:03] and he preached to him
[53:07] right
[53:09] he came back up by Paradise
[53:13] and picked up
[53:15] not just a spirit
[53:18] right
[53:22] he picked up a person and we'll get to
[53:25] it in a minute where brought around the
[53:26] city he was in his soul in his theophany
[53:28] when he went to hell
[53:31] well he was still in his soul it's
[53:32] theophany when he picked up Abraham and
[53:35] all of them and brought him up and you
[53:37] know Abraham was so
[53:40] human-like
[53:43] until he said Sarah we're being
[53:45] recognized we better get out of here
[53:52] okay
[53:55] what about him
[54:01] look at this one on souls in prison now
[54:03] 63 11 10 paragraph 36.
[54:09] now the soul of man is not the body of
[54:12] man it's the soul
[54:14] and the soul is something that's the the
[54:18] nature of the spirit that's right
[54:22] exactly right
[54:24] amen
[54:26] God whatever is displayed which Rim
[54:29] you're talking about it comes from The
[54:31] Sinner
[54:33] and displayed outwardly
[54:36] but just remember
[54:39] the reason you better agree with the
[54:41] spirit is being the second realm you can
[54:44] still be tempted in spirit
[54:49] you want to argue the case
[54:54] the Lord Jesus
[54:57] may I quote your prophet
[55:00] could be tempted of women
[55:06] it had to be an experience certainly
[55:08] wouldn't any soul
[55:10] well it was just his body your body
[55:12] can't be tempted without a spirit to
[55:15] motivate it
[55:17] it's dead
[55:20] the body can do nothing
[55:22] all right are you listening
[55:26] and when the nature of a man when he
[55:29] said we're dead the scripture plainly
[55:31] tells us that we are dead and our lives
[55:33] are hidden God through Christ
[55:35] sealed there by the Holy Spirit now it
[55:38] wasn't that your body died it wasn't
[55:41] your spirit died it was the nature of
[55:44] your spirit died
[55:46] come on
[55:48] the nature which is the soul
[55:53] so the soul is the main point come on
[55:57] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[56:00] born again
[56:03] if it's not it's of the world
[56:08] anything that begin has to end so
[56:11] therefore the only way that you can have
[56:13] eternal life
[56:14] is to have a life that never did begin
[56:17] and then your life did begin
[56:21] when you were born when God breathed the
[56:24] breath of life into your nostrils and
[56:27] you became a living Soul then you begin
[56:29] then
[56:31] right
[56:34] so when we come into the world God
[56:36] breathed the breath of life into her
[56:39] so
[56:41] but get to Point the nature of your soul
[56:43] is God if you're born again
[56:45] if it's not it's of the devil okay can I
[56:48] put the bottles back up
[56:51] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[56:53] born again if not
[56:55] it's the devil
[56:57] that's simple
[57:00] plain simple let's don't get in these
[57:02] gray areas people want to do that today
[57:05] yeah but you we got to have a little
[57:07] great no you don't have no gray areas in
[57:08] God
[57:12] he's either inside of us or he's not
[57:14] inside of us
[57:16] you're either born again or you're not
[57:18] born again
[57:20] now the title of the message is not is
[57:23] are we
[57:30] just anointed ones
[57:35] are we just anointed
[57:47] so he breathed into the nostrils and he
[57:49] became a living soul
[57:51] I've got some down through there about
[57:53] that and we're the man in the garden and
[57:56] whatever but if you don't know what I'm
[57:58] getting at now
[57:59] so the soul is the real you
[58:01] more real than your spirit or your body
[58:07] see the soul is the one who
[58:10] lives on after death
[58:15] all right we know that the soul then
[58:18] says is the theophany
[58:20] the Earth's worded it gets hard for
[58:22] people to follow you
[58:27] to say the soul is a theophany
[58:30] no no no no now brother Dale the
[58:32] theophany is off up yonder somewhere and
[58:35] we're going up there
[58:38] well
[58:40] if that stature of a perfect man is you
[58:43] then I don't see love being too far gone
[58:45] up above us
[58:47] it just needs to be made to our
[58:49] connections
[58:52] what are you listening
[58:56] you see why that
[58:58] you can go to church and be good
[59:01] exactly right
[59:05] you can shout Glory Hallelujah
[59:09] cry pray
[59:13] and still be lost
[59:19] now where you lost at
[59:28] but is that soul to you real
[59:33] or is it just a spirit it's just the
[59:36] nature of it it's just it's just the
[59:38] nature of it is the of God no
[59:44] you're either born again or you lost
[59:49] let's see go to number five jump a
[59:51] couple of them save a little time
[59:55] let's go to Hebrews
[59:57] number five
[1:00:00] all right
[1:00:01] this is paragraph 279 Hebrews chapter
[1:00:04] 2.
[1:00:06] but the difference between a man
[1:00:09] an animal and a man
[1:00:12] God put a soul in a man
[1:00:15] he didn't put it in the animal
[1:00:20] now stop there and think
[1:00:23] God put a soul in a man he didn't put it
[1:00:26] in the animal
[1:00:28] but an animal
[1:00:30] has a certain amount of reasoning
[1:00:32] factors
[1:00:34] it has a certain amount of emotions
[1:00:38] right
[1:00:40] it loves its Offspring it'll die for
[1:00:43] itself it has certain amount of those
[1:00:44] things what in the
[1:00:46] memory reason conscience
[1:00:51] you see it can't think
[1:00:53] like I've always told you I know I get
[1:00:56] hard
[1:00:57] would you take an old male buyer that
[1:01:00] has really got old an old board they
[1:01:04] call him
[1:01:05] and you know what he'll do
[1:01:09] he'll
[1:01:11] be sire at what the word is
[1:01:13] he'll have a baby bye female buyer
[1:01:19] and you know what he'll do
[1:01:21] he'll go kill that baby
[1:01:23] and you know what that Mama most of the
[1:01:25] time will die trying to save her a young
[1:01:28] one because that's the memories the
[1:01:30] reason the conscience is what little bit
[1:01:32] they have
[1:01:33] but you know what a few months later
[1:01:35] that female buyer will be looking that
[1:01:38] male up
[1:01:40] to mate again
[1:01:45] yet it's the one that killed The
[1:01:46] Offspring
[1:01:48] because there's your memory of your
[1:01:50] reason your conscience but there's no
[1:01:52] soul there
[1:01:57] the man has a soul
[1:01:59] and watch him
[1:02:02] God put a soul in a man
[1:02:04] put a soul in a man
[1:02:06] you know now then here's the man
[1:02:10] so he put in the man
[1:02:13] a soul
[1:02:15] because the soul that was in the man is
[1:02:18] that theophany
[1:02:20] no no brother Dale theophthany's up
[1:02:22] yonder
[1:02:29] it won't be converted from it anyway
[1:02:32] but what are you going to do with
[1:02:36] the rest of the message
[1:02:41] what are you going to do with number six
[1:02:45] questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:02:49] here his body was in the grave
[1:02:51] and his soul was in Hell preaching alive
[1:02:54] what about that
[1:02:56] he was in his theophany again
[1:02:59] his soul was down there with those
[1:03:02] people that were in theophany
[1:03:06] also and was witness to them
[1:03:10] that they repented not in the long
[1:03:11] suffering
[1:03:17] but see you don't even read the
[1:03:18] scripture
[1:03:20] but brother Dallas got to be up the
[1:03:22] undercover the Bible said if this
[1:03:24] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:03:27] we have one lady
[1:03:29] yeah
[1:03:32] if we don't reach this place we got one
[1:03:35] waiting now for us right
[1:03:37] call love
[1:03:45] what are you thinking
[1:03:48] look at adoption 1960.
[1:03:52] Paul says it does not appear yet
[1:03:55] just exactly what kind of a body we'll
[1:03:57] have
[1:03:58] we know we'll have a body like his
[1:04:01] what did he ever have what
[1:04:04] did he ever have that theophany body yes
[1:04:07] yes amen Jesus says yes sir when he died
[1:04:10] the Bible said that he is a personal
[1:04:12] pronoun again he went to hell and
[1:04:14] preached his souls in prison Hallelujah
[1:04:17] how did he do it he had senses of
[1:04:20] feeling
[1:04:24] come on he's in his theophany he had
[1:04:26] censored a Feeling
[1:04:29] he had sensitive hearing he had
[1:04:31] sensitive speech he preached
[1:04:34] with that same kind of body I saw those
[1:04:39] glorified ones in the other night
[1:04:48] he preached to the souls that were in
[1:04:50] hell every penny not in the long
[1:04:52] suffering in the days of Noah
[1:04:55] so evidently his soul was his theophany
[1:05:00] but he had the senses
[1:05:07] go ahead at number eight
[1:05:12] Hebrews chapter 6.
[1:05:15] it was the only visible form that the
[1:05:17] spirit had about the son of God
[1:05:20] and it was a theophany it means a body
[1:05:22] and the body was like a man
[1:05:28] Moses saw it when it passed through by
[1:05:31] The Rock and he looked at it said it
[1:05:34] looked like the hind part of a man
[1:05:38] through theophany is real
[1:05:42] what I'm trying to get you to see Jesus
[1:05:44] went to hell in theophany in his soul
[1:05:48] so his soul was his theophany
[1:05:51] but you still want to say my soul is
[1:05:54] here and my theophany is out yonder
[1:05:58] read the scripture
[1:06:01] if question
[1:06:03] this Earthly Tabernacle were
[1:06:11] you read your Bible
[1:06:13] if this early Tabernacle were
[1:06:18] dissolved we have one right
[1:06:20] right is it there or is it here
[1:06:27] which one is it
[1:06:29] all right
[1:06:30] look what he brings it out to me that
[1:06:33] was it and that was the theophany
[1:06:35] which was the son of God
[1:06:40] that son that logos became flesh
[1:06:44] because we were put in flesh
[1:06:46] and the theophany of the logos became
[1:06:48] flesh they're among us and it was
[1:06:50] nothing else but the dwelling place or
[1:06:52] the entire
[1:06:53] Fountain dwell in him or do you see it
[1:06:55] there it is that was the one
[1:07:00] what about it
[1:07:02] back part of a man that Moses saw
[1:07:05] what did that back part of that man
[1:07:06] looked like
[1:07:12] I believe it looked like Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] you can take your own opinion and do
[1:07:16] what you want to
[1:07:19] the theophany have things look at the
[1:07:22] next one questions and answers
[1:07:25] 385
[1:07:28] going up number nine
[1:07:31] it was a theophany to God that went out
[1:07:33] the human form that didn't have eyes
[1:07:36] like you see
[1:07:38] a better eye
[1:07:41] it didn't have ears like you hear but a
[1:07:45] far more hearing see it was a theophany
[1:07:47] and all this rainbow condescended into
[1:07:49] the Moses saw it when it passed
[1:07:52] through the rock like that he saw the
[1:07:54] back parts
[1:07:56] said it looked like a man
[1:07:59] now according to Hebrews 7 4
[1:08:02] melchized it says the man
[1:08:05] you remember
[1:08:06] but around him explaining that
[1:08:09] all right
[1:08:13] look at the next one
[1:08:15] questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:08:17] this is paragraph 841 number 10.
[1:08:22] well my dear sainted brother my dear
[1:08:24] signage sister before the foundation of
[1:08:27] the world when God created You In His
[1:08:29] Image or created the The Man In His
[1:08:32] Image and created a woman in the image
[1:08:35] of the man for the glory of the man he
[1:08:37] made you a theophany just like himself
[1:08:41] when he said let us to the creatures
[1:08:44] that he had made let us make man in our
[1:08:47] own image our likeness a theophany God
[1:08:50] had never become flesh yet he was in it
[1:08:52] theophany and Moses saw him Moses cried
[1:08:56] Lord let me see you
[1:08:59] did you catch the
[1:09:01] and it was the back part of a man
[1:09:03] did you catch the quote about two away
[1:09:06] from this one where he said that
[1:09:08] theophany is the son of God
[1:09:16] I thought New Birth
[1:09:18] made us The Offspring of God
[1:09:23] I thought that it was Son of God down
[1:09:25] through seven Church ages
[1:09:29] I thought a Son of God you can't talk
[1:09:31] about it Son of God being an eternal
[1:09:33] sonship
[1:09:36] we test this offspring
[1:09:39] he made it theophany just like himself
[1:09:42] when he said
[1:09:50] let me get this part
[1:09:53] okay
[1:09:54] if you're not catching on then you're
[1:09:57] just pray
[1:09:58] uh
[1:10:02] look at number 11.
[1:10:05] this is taking off in the north at knot
[1:10:08] and God he talks about making the three
[1:10:10] rings
[1:10:13] he says God
[1:10:14] that's God
[1:10:16] he made the three rings he said that's
[1:10:17] God
[1:10:20] God in a Trinity is One
[1:10:23] to remember the tree rings is one person
[1:10:28] not a trinity of persons
[1:10:31] follow me
[1:10:34] watch now
[1:10:35] and God God is a trinity a trinity in
[1:10:39] one
[1:10:40] we're down here without a trinity he's
[1:10:42] not God he can't be manifest any other
[1:10:45] way and neither can you be manifest
[1:10:47] without being the Trinity person that
[1:10:50] you are that's Body Spirit soul
[1:10:55] without either one of them you're not
[1:10:57] complete see you don't have you didn't
[1:11:00] have a soul
[1:11:02] and what he's he's saying it like if you
[1:11:04] didn't you know you didn't have a soul
[1:11:06] you'd be nothing you didn't have a
[1:11:08] spirit you wouldn't be or nothing
[1:11:10] you know you wouldn't be nothing
[1:11:13] you didn't have a body you'd just be a
[1:11:15] spirit not a body
[1:11:18] now
[1:11:19] so as God is one
[1:11:23] so are we one
[1:11:26] Body Spirit and soul right
[1:11:30] you know why because my body is
[1:11:32] displaying what's in my soul right now
[1:11:36] in my spirit Within Me is trying its
[1:11:40] best to reason every factor in trying to
[1:11:42] to look at you and saying well some of
[1:11:45] them is agreeing some of them are
[1:11:46] different
[1:11:47] some of them still Sourpuss and some of
[1:11:49] them just smiling so at least some
[1:11:51] things are working
[1:11:58] okay let's get done in a hurry go ahead
[1:12:00] and North it not
[1:12:03] what's this about anointed ones and
[1:12:05] north at not which is number 12.
[1:12:09] what the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:12:11] Ghost is what you're talking about now
[1:12:12] people can live in this Spirit they can
[1:12:15] dance in the spirit they shout in the
[1:12:17] spirit they go to church in the spirit
[1:12:19] they can absolutely have the real spirit
[1:12:21] of God anointed on that Spirit but still
[1:12:24] be lost and just as devil possess
[1:12:29] as they can be
[1:12:31] that's right with that spirit so now you
[1:12:34] better make sure you get your soul and
[1:12:36] your spirit right
[1:12:38] okay
[1:12:40] and I'm still with you the soul is the
[1:12:43] nature of the spirit the spirit is the
[1:12:44] nature of the Soul I've been through all
[1:12:46] of that
[1:12:48] whatever's inside of me
[1:12:50] is going to come out
[1:12:53] here's where the trick comes
[1:12:57] a genuine Holy Spirit can anoint that
[1:12:59] Spirit of that individual
[1:13:03] right
[1:13:09] now watch it
[1:13:12] because watch that's the reason you
[1:13:14] couldn't tell that woman she was wearing
[1:13:16] shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her
[1:13:19] Bobby and her hair was wrong
[1:13:21] well what's your higher Got to Do With
[1:13:23] It Well it did the Samson okay
[1:13:26] whosoever so I had one word to this or
[1:13:28] take one word out of it
[1:13:30] you got to have the ultimate somewhere
[1:13:34] that's why you can't tell that woman
[1:13:36] it's wrong
[1:13:37] to cut her hair
[1:13:40] and if you are cutting your hair just to
[1:13:44] end off to straighten it up
[1:13:47] you can fall in the category of anointed
[1:13:49] ones
[1:13:51] not as true Christians
[1:13:56] is it a question
[1:13:58] are we anointed ones
[1:14:01] but remember back up there are you
[1:14:02] shouting the spirit you go to church
[1:14:04] every day in your life
[1:14:07] you can get a gold star when you die
[1:14:10] until put it on your casket and say
[1:14:12] they're going to heaven
[1:14:14] you notice nobody goes to hell anymore
[1:14:17] all right but look at him
[1:14:20] so we know he's talking about the spirit
[1:14:22] realm right
[1:14:24] anointing ones are anointed in the
[1:14:26] spirit Realm now can I take a second to
[1:14:28] explain
[1:14:30] see in body he was my brother
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:36] in spirit
[1:14:37] he's the spirit of almighty God
[1:14:41] in Soul he is the the
[1:14:44] Eternal person amen
[1:14:47] amen all right
[1:14:49] now
[1:14:50] so then you and I are
[1:14:54] body
[1:14:55] Spirit come on Soul right we're born
[1:14:59] again in Soul not in body and spirit so
[1:15:02] God can come down and anoint and listen
[1:15:07] anointed ones are anointed ones
[1:15:13] I'm glad to be an anointed one
[1:15:16] oh you don't like that
[1:15:20] you better be glad to be
[1:15:23] I'd invite you to go home in your
[1:15:25] computer and run in the word anoint
[1:15:29] all right and run it back through there
[1:15:32] of the oil and the ways of the things
[1:15:35] you'll come out with a different thought
[1:15:37] you'll say brother Dale I really want to
[1:15:40] be anointed
[1:15:45] I just don't want to stay
[1:15:47] as those who are anointed ones
[1:15:52] but are false
[1:15:54] not the anointing is false
[1:15:57] the anointing is genuine
[1:16:00] but if that soul is not born again
[1:16:05] what good is it
[1:16:07] but what's the difference in you or
[1:16:10] somebody else
[1:16:14] you're not born again in your body
[1:16:17] the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:16:19] through the goodness the Bible said to
[1:16:21] call us to repentance and makes our
[1:16:23] spirit start Desiring and longing for
[1:16:26] him
[1:16:28] and if we stay in that realm we can be
[1:16:31] anointed
[1:16:33] for great things
[1:16:35] but if we go on to the new birth
[1:16:41] you see the anointing on you quickens
[1:16:45] the word in your soul that's right
[1:16:47] that's why I said I'm glad to be
[1:16:49] anointed because it quickens the word of
[1:16:51] my soul but if the devil is in my soul
[1:16:56] he can anoint my spirit
[1:16:58] and it won't do a bit of good
[1:17:02] I'm still lost
[1:17:05] are you following me
[1:17:09] the new birth
[1:17:11] is the anointing of the spirit that
[1:17:13] cleanses the unclean Spirit goeth out of
[1:17:15] the man walketh in dry places find us
[1:17:17] rest then it comes back right
[1:17:20] Iran said the most dangerous stage is
[1:17:23] sanctification
[1:17:25] because see you think you're a Christian
[1:17:27] that's that new spirit he spoke of in
[1:17:30] Ezekiel
[1:17:34] I know that I've stirred some thoughts
[1:17:37] in your mind tonight
[1:17:39] because you see
[1:17:41] I look at two people sitting there
[1:17:45] and I look at those two people
[1:17:48] and I see both of them crying out for
[1:17:51] God
[1:17:54] I see both of them Desiring God
[1:18:00] and what are you going to do
[1:18:03] the good old-fashioned way is brother
[1:18:06] Dale let's just leave them alone because
[1:18:08] they love the Lord you can love the Lord
[1:18:11] every day of your life die and go to
[1:18:12] hell
[1:18:17] it's whether or not that soul is born
[1:18:19] again or not
[1:18:23] did Balaam
[1:18:26] have the same anointing
[1:18:29] or was he anointing on Elijah
[1:18:33] anointing on Elijah was not in his soul
[1:18:36] because he couldn't be born again
[1:18:41] so the anointing on Elijah was the same
[1:18:43] as anointing on Balaam what was the
[1:18:46] difference
[1:18:48] the word
[1:18:52] you remember the disciples
[1:18:55] there were many walked with the Lord
[1:18:57] Jesus but it says that some of them took
[1:19:00] the word and held it
[1:19:03] when they went to the upper room there's
[1:19:05] the New Birth the anointing coming down
[1:19:08] because remember
[1:19:11] especially in the last days come on I
[1:19:13] went through it right
[1:19:14] he poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:19:19] how can you tell the difference in them
[1:19:20] we'll read that in a minute you go back
[1:19:22] to the word
[1:19:26] see that's why you're missing it
[1:19:29] you think this is a goody goody Affair
[1:19:31] sometimes I got to be rough
[1:19:34] I remember brother dick one time was
[1:19:36] talking about a certain situation
[1:19:38] he said I'll pick up some stones and say
[1:19:41] who's going to cast the first one I said
[1:19:42] I'm the pastor I got to cast the stone
[1:19:46] I have no choice
[1:19:48] you want to swap places with me
[1:19:52] I've got to cast the stone why because I
[1:19:55] got to stay with the scripture
[1:19:58] you can Petey pattern how much you love
[1:20:00] and you lovey-dovey Duffy's
[1:20:03] don't lovey-dovey with me
[1:20:06] you go right out there in that church
[1:20:08] system and find more love and displayed
[1:20:12] then it's displayed in this building
[1:20:13] right here
[1:20:16] well where are they
[1:20:18] tell them the word
[1:20:23] all right let's read a little bit
[1:20:26] where'd we get to we get number 12.
[1:20:32] yeah we're at number 12 go to 13.
[1:20:35] works is Faith Express the spirit can
[1:20:37] come out here and anoint you to do
[1:20:39] certain things
[1:20:40] and you do it it don't mean you're saved
[1:20:43] think of it
[1:20:45] conference prophesied Judas cast out
[1:20:47] Devils see the spirit anointed him
[1:20:50] remember the conference the condo
[1:20:52] priests the lovey-dovey guy
[1:20:55] yeah
[1:20:57] till he crossed him
[1:21:00] this rain falls into just the unjust the
[1:21:02] weeds can Rejoice with a wheat but it's
[1:21:05] what it is at the core
[1:21:09] now here's where you can intellectually
[1:21:13] can accept and say oh sure that looks
[1:21:15] good I believe that I still don't do it
[1:21:18] no sir and the spirit can actually make
[1:21:21] witness of it and still It Isn't So
[1:21:25] because if that Soul hasn't come from
[1:21:29] God
[1:21:31] let me rephrase if that Soul hadn't been
[1:21:33] born again
[1:21:34] that's right okay
[1:21:35] it can make all the impersonation out of
[1:21:37] there but it cannot be real you can act
[1:21:40] healing you can act like you have it you
[1:21:41] can act like you should receive it
[1:21:43] Christians act like they're Christians
[1:21:45] and act and be ever so good at it but
[1:21:48] that don't mean that you're saved right
[1:21:51] that's exactly right see the spirit can
[1:21:53] be there the real genuine Spirit the
[1:21:55] Holy Spirit can anoint you that still
[1:21:58] don't mean you're saved it's that inside
[1:22:00] soul that never dies it's got eternal
[1:22:05] life it always was eternal life then it
[1:22:09] come from God it goes to God
[1:22:12] if you have eternal life tonight
[1:22:16] you're going to be happy about it
[1:22:19] if you don't have it you're to be crying
[1:22:23] you better get something settled and
[1:22:25] we're running out of time
[1:22:27] he said with my soul I don't know where
[1:22:29] it comes from God or not well how do you
[1:22:31] know what it comes from God or not
[1:22:33] see what I'll do with the word okay
[1:22:36] look still on works is Faith expressed
[1:22:40] roll up to number 14.
[1:22:46] now remember you're in a cycle of three
[1:22:49] but you're one person
[1:22:51] like father son the Holy Ghost I love to
[1:22:52] read but one person three attributes to
[1:22:54] the same God father who had three
[1:22:56] officers like fatherhood sonship Holy
[1:22:58] Ghost and you are Body Spirit and soul
[1:23:01] now the outside body has five interests
[1:23:04] endless to it to contact your Earthly
[1:23:06] home see taste feel smell in here the
[1:23:09] inside which is a spirit it has five
[1:23:11] senses conscience and love and so forth
[1:23:14] but the inside of that the soul has one
[1:23:17] thing
[1:23:19] that's where
[1:23:20] you live
[1:23:24] that's where you live the Inside Man
[1:23:27] all right
[1:23:29] let's see
[1:23:30] okay keep on going
[1:23:33] because I gave them these on a two-part
[1:23:35] and notice that it's got to be five
[1:23:38] if a i t h outside Spirit j-e-s-u-s on
[1:23:41] the inside y o u see that's how stand
[1:23:44] here looking at you
[1:23:47] I don't know a one of you the spirit can
[1:23:49] anoint me still I don't know none of you
[1:23:52] but when the inside of the inside breaks
[1:23:55] in
[1:23:56] that's God
[1:23:59] you want me to show you one thing the
[1:24:01] prophet said he said let me show you one
[1:24:03] day this discernment is a revelation
[1:24:07] you've heard that one
[1:24:09] it's a revelation
[1:24:10] that's where the outside can reason like
[1:24:13] a man said well you know I know not
[1:24:15] supposed to commit adultery all right
[1:24:17] roll it on up you can read all in
[1:24:18] between tell him I shouldn't commit
[1:24:20] Adele to bring it on them because again
[1:24:22] that's the control tower the inside of
[1:24:24] the inside the soul controls the spirit
[1:24:27] the spirit controls the body so when I
[1:24:29] so and outside whitewash don't make any
[1:24:33] difference he says and religious people
[1:24:35] back there call it whitewashing
[1:24:37] everything else but inside of the inside
[1:24:40] the soul that just believe it that's the
[1:24:42] reason I say people can jump up and down
[1:24:44] and speak in tongues people can shout
[1:24:47] lay hands on the sick
[1:24:48] Judas did it and healed the sick and so
[1:24:52] forth by faith all these great things
[1:24:54] that are by the spirit still be lost
[1:24:58] anointed ones
[1:25:00] on up
[1:25:02] 15. modern events make clear about
[1:25:04] prophecy
[1:25:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean
[1:25:08] that you're going in not at all
[1:25:11] not on that don't have anything to do
[1:25:13] with your soul
[1:25:16] whoa
[1:25:20] now if you read that one before you read
[1:25:22] the others look where your mind would be
[1:25:24] going I read the others about that the
[1:25:27] anointed ones are anointed on their
[1:25:28] spirit
[1:25:29] so that you'd follow it down to this
[1:25:31] line
[1:25:33] if you read this without reading them
[1:25:34] what would you have
[1:25:40] I don't have any that's the baptism
[1:25:43] here's the inside soul in here that has
[1:25:45] to come from God but then on the outside
[1:25:48] you have five senses and five analysts
[1:25:50] to contact your early home inside you
[1:25:52] have a spirit to find out let's
[1:25:54] conscious love and so forth remember in
[1:25:57] that Spirit you can be baptized with the
[1:25:59] genuine spirit of God and still be lost
[1:26:04] is the soul that lives
[1:26:06] that was ordained of God didn't Jesus
[1:26:09] say many will come to me in that day and
[1:26:11] say Lord have we not cast out Devils
[1:26:13] none Great and Mighty works prophesied
[1:26:16] the great gifts of God he said depart
[1:26:19] from me he that work iniquity I never
[1:26:21] even knew you
[1:26:22] many will come in that day
[1:26:25] never knew you because you never had any
[1:26:27] birth
[1:26:29] all right
[1:26:30] leadership
[1:26:35] the choice of your conduct
[1:26:39] you could
[1:26:40] you can't mix it now
[1:26:42] you're either for God or against God
[1:26:47] and the outside expression expression
[1:26:49] shows what's on the inside
[1:26:54] right
[1:26:56] see the Kookaburra many of you think I
[1:26:58] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:27:00] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:27:01] thing that you're going to heaven no sir
[1:27:03] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:05] Ghost every hour in your life and still
[1:27:08] be lost and go to hell the Bible says so
[1:27:11] that's exactly right so now you know
[1:27:14] he's talking about it's got to be on the
[1:27:16] spirit right
[1:27:19] you see where you just take a quote and
[1:27:20] read it
[1:27:25] without it put together what have you
[1:27:27] got
[1:27:30] anointed once the end time 17. let me
[1:27:33] get just a few more
[1:27:36] leadership going to 17.
[1:27:39] it's the dolphin only once the end time
[1:27:41] do you believe that that anointing on
[1:27:43] those people means that it's the
[1:27:45] anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir
[1:27:47] the genuine holy spirit of God upon a
[1:27:49] person
[1:27:50] and yet their faults
[1:27:54] going to the next an anointing once the
[1:27:57] end time I just got these where you
[1:27:59] could read I wish you'd go to anointing
[1:28:00] once the end time and I didn't mark this
[1:28:02] one so I'll have to pick it paragraph
[1:28:05] 46. the same holy spirit that anoints
[1:28:07] the church
[1:28:11] that gives them desire to say Souls
[1:28:14] that gives them power to perform
[1:28:15] miracles
[1:28:17] it falls on the unjust it's the same as
[1:28:20] the Josh
[1:28:22] the very same Spirit now you can't make
[1:28:25] it any other way and understand anointed
[1:28:27] wants
[1:28:29] with a genuine thing but false prophets
[1:28:33] false teachers of it or to make a man
[1:28:36] want to be a false teacher of something
[1:28:38] that's truth
[1:28:40] you get down to the mark of the beast
[1:28:43] he says
[1:28:45] what would make you
[1:28:47] want to follow something
[1:28:50] they cannot be proven to be true
[1:28:54] the Bible says prove all things
[1:29:03] let's get to next from 19.
[1:29:05] this is all still off of
[1:29:07] and only ones Parker 74. all right
[1:29:10] notice both of them I'll have to yeah
[1:29:13] motives both of them both of them
[1:29:16] anointed
[1:29:17] now how could you tell which was right
[1:29:20] in Rome
[1:29:23] watch what the word promised to Ahab
[1:29:29] one Prophet following the word right
[1:29:32] you read all they're talking about one
[1:29:34] Prophet followed the word
[1:29:36] one said he didn't give a who what the
[1:29:38] word said
[1:29:39] he was anointed
[1:29:42] are we anointed ones
[1:29:45] are we genuine Christians
[1:29:52] look delicious
[1:29:54] I got two or three more but we'll go on
[1:29:56] this one
[1:29:58] the watch Jesus said that in this end
[1:30:00] time again the two Spirits would be real
[1:30:02] close together again is that right
[1:30:05] congregation says amen notice now it
[1:30:08] will be closer than that was talking
[1:30:10] about what was behind
[1:30:12] this is the end time all children God
[1:30:14] have mercy upon us
[1:30:16] till it wouldn't even be so real till it
[1:30:19] would receive the very elect
[1:30:21] if possible
[1:30:22] now how are you going
[1:30:25] how did we tell it in them days
[1:30:29] how are you going to tell it today
[1:30:32] the same way
[1:30:33] stay with the word
[1:30:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:30:36] and forever amen
[1:30:38] just in case you think I can never be
[1:30:41] totally deceived I agree with you
[1:30:43] but I want to read one final quote quota
[1:30:46] number 23. we'll quit
[1:30:49] look what your Prophet says about it
[1:30:55] he predicted that the spirit in the
[1:30:57] system would be so close
[1:30:59] be so much like the real thing and it
[1:31:02] deceived the very elected if it was
[1:31:03] possible the elected whose name was put
[1:31:06] on the lounge book of life before the
[1:31:07] foundation were now before I read this
[1:31:09] let me state it again I believe that the
[1:31:12] prophet and the Bible the elect cannot
[1:31:14] be deceived
[1:31:16] that's right now watch though and
[1:31:18] frankly it got them so tied up
[1:31:22] until he said if he didn't cut the work
[1:31:25] short
[1:31:26] for their sake there would be no flesh
[1:31:28] saved upon the Earth
[1:31:32] frankly it got them right
[1:31:37] he said brother Dale I just can't
[1:31:39] understand
[1:31:40] that puts you in a category of most of
[1:31:42] all of us
[1:31:47] without the Holy Spirit to keep us right
[1:31:49] what do we got
[1:31:52] right without him to lead us what have
[1:31:53] we got
[1:31:55] where can we go
[1:31:57] well there's more love out there okay
[1:32:00] that don't mean it
[1:32:05] is only the word
[1:32:07] you see why that they've made a lot of
[1:32:09] Lula I wish they did you should word
[1:32:11] word all they believe is word word word
[1:32:13] well that's all I ever known it was
[1:32:18] yeah but I I know people's got a whole
[1:32:20] lot more love than you got brother Dale
[1:32:24] go chase them
[1:32:27] but let me go with you
[1:32:30] for a minute
[1:32:31] and let me cross them
[1:32:34] and we'll see who's got the spirit of
[1:32:36] love
[1:32:41] and I don't have to go with you you just
[1:32:44] quote the word to them
[1:32:47] and you'll find out that they'll just
[1:32:49] slowly back away
[1:32:52] and I'm not throwing off on nobody you
[1:32:54] know better than that
[1:32:56] come on I've been here your pastor a
[1:32:58] long time you know that I've always said
[1:33:01] there were people out there just like
[1:33:03] you and I are people
[1:33:05] they may make it and we may miss it
[1:33:12] I don't mind talking like that
[1:33:16] yeah but I don't want my people to hear
[1:33:18] stuff like that I won't mind to hear the
[1:33:20] truth
[1:33:21] and then you can make up your mind what
[1:33:23] to do about it
[1:33:27] I thought this Prophet come to bring us
[1:33:29] the word I didn't know he come to bring
[1:33:31] us the spirit
[1:33:37] promise of the word
[1:33:44] you see you don't like it you don't like
[1:33:46] what I said while ago
[1:33:48] but you draw them three realms
[1:33:50] and you look at it
[1:33:52] that Holy Spirit
[1:33:54] comes down and anoints your spirit
[1:34:00] but if that word is held in your heart
[1:34:02] correctly
[1:34:04] Why didn't it do it to all of the
[1:34:06] disciples they never held the word
[1:34:10] right
[1:34:11] scene of over 500 Brethren after his
[1:34:15] resurrection
[1:34:17] 380 of them didn't make it to the upper
[1:34:19] room
[1:34:24] oh but the condo you know condo priests
[1:34:26] carthus
[1:34:28] just crossing
[1:34:33] I love everybody and I want everybody to
[1:34:35] be there
[1:34:37] but I've also got to stand for the truth
[1:34:40] and I got to tell it to you like it
[1:34:43] and tell it to you the way I believe it
[1:34:47] well don't you think them brothers or
[1:34:49] are good Brothers I ain't got no problem
[1:34:51] with being good brother
[1:34:54] the pope is a good man
[1:34:56] you ain't never been shot for what you
[1:34:58] believe
[1:34:59] they had one a few back from this one
[1:35:01] they got shot for what he believed his
[1:35:04] lovey-dovey brought him a bullet
[1:35:09] am I right

[1:35:18] there
[1:35:23] you'll say thank you come on brother
[1:35:26] you'll say thank you for telling me the
[1:35:27] truth
[1:35:32] you see the difference is whether the
[1:35:34] word is being revealed to you
[1:35:41] well I'd rather have the love than the
[1:35:43] word go ahead
[1:35:45] but why can't you have the love of God
[1:35:48] and the word
[1:35:50] why can't you fall in love with the word
[1:35:55] why take the sky full of all the things
[1:35:57] when we've got the greatest it's ever
[1:35:59] been
[1:36:00] we've had a prophet to bring us the word
[1:36:05] sometimes it got pretty rough
[1:36:08] as a matter of fact I please would plead
[1:36:11] with you to listen to anointed once the
[1:36:13] end time
[1:36:17] and I want you to listen all the way to
[1:36:19] the end of it
[1:36:21] to where brother Reynolds said the
[1:36:24] altars were full
[1:36:27] people crying out
[1:36:30] because they were wondering whether they
[1:36:32] were anointed ones or not
[1:36:34] because he made it so strong until
[1:36:37] they were wondering if there was any
[1:36:39] opportunity
[1:36:40] for them
[1:36:46] it's a serious matter
[1:36:50] what we got brother let's stand
[1:36:54] there is a fountain of blood what about
[1:36:57] the word
[1:37:02] there is a fountain filled with blood
[1:37:07] drawn from anybody have a name
[1:37:12] and sinners
[1:37:26] time
[1:37:34] and Sanders
[1:38:12] my sins away
[1:38:26] the dying live thy Precious Blood shall
[1:38:33] never lose its power
[1:38:36] till all the ransom Church of God are
[1:38:43] saved to sin no more
[1:38:48] saved to sin no more
[1:38:52] are saved to sin no more desire
[1:39:04] Lord we know for surely what you do you
[1:39:07] look down to the desires of an
[1:39:10] individual honest and
[1:39:12] then you'll answer that heart
[1:39:14] so we pray that you would manifest
[1:39:17] yourself come on and sing and speak to
[1:39:19] our brother
[1:39:23] help him to walk very in the Lord just
[1:39:26] bless him and got him in Jesus name we
[1:39:30] love you Lord
[1:39:33] anybody else
[1:39:40] remembers
[1:39:45] I know I love the Lord I know I go to
[1:39:49] church I know it and you can still be
[1:39:51] lost
[1:39:53] songs what's your Prophet saying
[1:39:58] but what about the words
[1:40:07] is it just our word no there's word and
[1:40:11] spirit but all we can deal with is
[1:40:14] planting the word it takes the Holy
[1:40:17] Spirit to Quicken it
[1:40:20] everything
[1:40:26] so you can't turn the word down
[1:40:30] you gotta you gotta walk according to
[1:40:33] the word
[1:40:36] he said but you know I just don't see
[1:40:39] the love
[1:40:41] well you know what
[1:40:44] bless your little heart darling I don't
[1:40:47] see it in you
[1:40:49] now what have we got
[1:40:51] under argument over who's got the best
[1:40:53] love
[1:41:00] I didn't think we're supposed to argue
[1:41:01] we had the best
[1:41:03] I thought we're supposed to be concerned
[1:41:05] about being the love of God
[1:41:08] made manifest
[1:41:10] in our hearts and our lives
[1:41:12] to walk in the light of the hour that
[1:41:14] we're living
[1:41:20] what do you think about it Lord Jesus
[1:41:23] just bless us now as we're going our way
[1:41:25] home
[1:41:26] sorry for being a little empty tonight
[1:41:27] Lord
[1:41:29] but you couldn't stop and to finish
[1:41:32] I pray that you'd help everybody and
[1:41:33] give them understanding of what we're
[1:41:35] talking about
[1:41:37] we're talking about an inward being and
[1:41:39] of a man that
[1:41:43] is eternal
[1:41:46] and cannot be comprehended or understood
[1:41:49] in any way
[1:41:52] because he's an odd person
[1:41:55] and all of those who walk in the light
[1:41:57] of the love of Jesus Christ are odd
[1:41:59] people
[1:42:02] never understood by people
[1:42:04] because they think it's something else
[1:42:09] but Lord
[1:42:12] you as that man that walked
[1:42:16] and you was that man that loved
[1:42:20] but yet you had to condemn
[1:42:24] you had to say it like it was because
[1:42:26] you was God
[1:42:29] and just bless us now and give us a safe
[1:42:31] journey home that everybody Lord be safe
[1:42:34] and let your love be with us touch the
[1:42:36] sick among us we love you and we thank
[1:42:38] you in Jesus name
