[2:11] in Romans
[2:14] 8 and we'll be reading in Genesis 2
[2:19] Romans 8 Genesis 2 now remember to pray
[2:23] for I know you have but pray for for
[2:26] Brother Ray Gabriel uh there's not any
[2:29] problem much with his kidneys but
[2:30] there's a blood count keeps activating
[2:33] you know going down or doing something

[2:40] and also just just remember him and keep
[2:43] him in your prayers the reason they're
[2:45] not here she's sister Kathy is having to
[2:47] work some late you know so that makes it
[2:49] hard on them to try to get here but just
[2:52] remember these remember the sick among
[2:53] us and pray that the Lord would bless
[2:55] each and and everyone and keep us all in
[2:58] his love amen Romans 8 and Genesis 2
[3:02] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[3:04] this day in your grace unto us we thank
[3:07] you for Calvary we thank you for your
[3:09] love and your understanding we thank you
[3:11] for All Things We Praise Your Great Name
[3:14] and we believe that your word is true
[3:16] that you said you sent your word and
[3:18] healed us and delivered us from
[3:20] destruction so come among us tonight
[3:22] Lord and work your work Among Us and
[3:25] just set your people free and guide each
[3:27] one of us may we all be together as one
[3:30] in you and just forgive our sins make us
[3:34] to be what you want us to be have your
[3:36] way with us now and guide us in Jesus
[3:39] name amen
[3:41] amen Romans
[3:45] 8 28 and we know that all things work
[3:48] together for good to them that love God
[3:51] to them who are thee called according to
[3:53] his purpose now if you notice it's
[3:55] saying to the called so it's a special
[3:57] group but it's also saying
[4:00] uh you know that uh all things work
[4:02] together for them that love God well
[4:06] that doesn't mean it's going to work for
[4:07] everybody right only who those who truly
[4:10] love God and for those who are the
[4:11] called according to his purpose for whom
[4:14] he did for know he also did predestinate
[4:17] to be conformed to the image of his son
[4:19] that he might be the firstborn among
[4:21] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[4:24] predestinate them he also called and
[4:26] whom he called them he also Justified
[4:29] and whom he Justified them he also
[4:31] glorified what shall we then say to
[4:34] these things what is it if God be for us
[4:37] who can be against us right amen let's
[4:40] go over to Genesis now and where we pick
[4:43] up our
[4:44] thought we'll just read a little bit in
[4:46] Genesis
[4:47] 2 uh 7-9 then jump over to verse
[4:54] 177 and the Lord God formed man of the
[4:57] Dust of the ground and breathed into his
[4:59] night noil your breath of life and he
[5:00] became a living soul and the Lord God
[5:03] planted a garden Eastward in Eden and
[5:05] there he put the man whom he had formed
[5:08] and out of the ground made he made out
[5:11] of the ground made the Lord God to grow
[5:14] every tree that is Pleasant to the sight
[5:17] and good for food the tree of life also
[5:20] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[5:22] of knowledge of Good and Evil now notice
[5:25] two trees one is the Tree of Life the
[5:29] other is the tree of knowledge of Good
[5:30] and Evil all right now's go look at
[5:33] verse 17 see where the Commandment
[5:36] came verse 16 and the Lord God commanded
[5:39] a man saying of every tree of the garden
[5:40] thou mayest freely eat but of the tree
[5:43] of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou
[5:46] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[5:49] thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely
[5:52] die you may be seated the Lord add his
[5:54] Blessing to the reading of the
[5:58] word now now we've been studying for
[6:01] quite a while from here in
[6:04] Romans and thinking about and the topic
[6:08] has been you know how does God
[6:11] predestinate am all right now how does
[6:15] God
[6:16] predestinate see some people think that
[6:20] he predestines because of maybe they're
[6:23] good you know a good people so he
[6:26] predestinated me there's many doctrines
[6:29] world has basically the religious realm
[6:32] is basically split split over the
[6:35] doctrine of
[6:37] predestination you have your your uh
[6:40] calvinistic form which comes forth and
[6:43] brings it on into the Baptist Etc and
[6:46] they hold to a point of you know
[6:49] especially the old primitive form of
[6:50] Baptist hold to the point you know well
[6:53] I'm predestinated I don't even have to
[6:56] worry about it God's going to save me
[6:57] one day somewhere and even as I've told
[7:00] you and you go back and check your
[7:01] history that some of them back there
[7:04] they didn't even believe in having
[7:06] Revival because they're afraid you might
[7:08] your kids might get saved when God
[7:10] didn't want them saved you say now
[7:12] that's that's kind of dumb well you go
[7:14] read the history and see if that's not
[7:17] what they said you know that was their
[7:20] thoughts and if you want that you just
[7:22] contact me about it be glad to show you
[7:24] where it come from and the doctrines
[7:26] well then you got that part then you go
[7:28] over from the calvinistic over into the
[7:32] Armenian form of uh Works Etc and people
[7:37] lean on the basis of I done something
[7:39] good this that or the other etc etc you
[7:43] know I paved the parking lot you know
[7:45] there's a lot of people preached into
[7:47] heaven that live like the devil all of
[7:49] their life and they just you know paint
[7:51] the church or pave the parking lot and
[7:53] the preacher preaches them into heaven
[7:56] because that's their their way of going
[7:58] you know right and that's their
[8:01] predestination but what have we found
[8:03] after all of studying and trying to
[8:05] cover all of the things that Paul summed
[8:08] it up by saying those who he for knows
[8:12] right amen forne
[8:14] Forno he did
[8:17] predestinate all right so we've been
[8:20] through it for quite a while studying it
[8:22] on the point of thinking that people
[8:24] want to go to predestination first which
[8:26] means a a destiny set that's the word
[8:30] predestination or or a set point the uh
[8:34] you know you didn't have anything to do
[8:36] with it there's no way you could kept
[8:38] from coming to church tonight cuz it's
[8:41] predestinated well see you did have
[8:43] something to do with it you got ready
[8:46] you cleaned up you know you you come to
[8:49] church you drove a lot of miles so there
[8:52] is a lot to do with it but see then
[8:55] looking at it
[8:56] correctly we we think about it as for
[8:59] knowledge is the greatest thing that
[9:02] could ever be thought of about uh
[9:05] Mankind and his
[9:06] doings that God
[9:09] fornew some people would want to be
[9:11] saved that's right but it's also at the
[9:15] same time he forew that some would not
[9:18] want to be
[9:19] saved now he will not override your free
[9:22] moral
[9:24] agency he gives you the choice it's not
[9:27] a stamped act of fact coming into life
[9:30] you
[9:31] know no well I happen to be born of a
[9:33] certain lineage and like coming into the
[9:35] message people they get into where if
[9:38] you're born from Adam you could be saved
[9:40] but if you come down from the lineage of
[9:42] the Beast you couldn't be saved well
[9:44] that's all garbage can and Paul said it
[9:46] endless genealogies and he said he
[9:49] didn't like that all right but thinking
[9:52] about it see for knowledge then will
[9:54] come
[9:56] before predestination amen
[10:00] he didn't predestinate and then for no
[10:04] no you know I mean you and I wouldn't do
[10:07] that we wouldn't go build a house and
[10:09] then decide what kind of house we want
[10:10] to build
[10:12] right you know what s thought some
[10:15] boards and build a house well how you
[10:18] going well we don't know how going to
[10:19] it's going to build it we wouldn't do
[10:20] something like that God doesn't either
[10:23] amen right remember we're not playing
[10:25] with somebody that doesn't know all
[10:27] things amen when you're talking about
[10:30] God remember he knows every thought that
[10:33] ever could anybody could ever have or
[10:36] else he's not
[10:37] omnicient if he's not omniscient then he
[10:41] wouldn't be
[10:42] Eternal and if he if he's just gaining
[10:45] ground of knowledge then which tree is
[10:48] he on we'll get to it in a little bit
[10:50] we're going to talk about those two
[10:51] trees all right but see forn knowledge
[10:54] comes first right so God fornew who
[10:59] would want to be saved and who wouldn't
[11:02] amen so then he could predestinate and
[11:05] say Jacob have I loved right but Esau
[11:09] how I hated that's right all right
[11:13] before they were ever born right right
[11:16] before they ever done anything wrong
[11:18] that's right whatever he could go ahead
[11:20] and say why because he could look all
[11:22] the way down to the end and see what
[11:26] would be am all right that's his for
[11:28] knowledge
[11:29] so he forew all things all
[11:33] right but then in knowing it and for
[11:37] knowing all
[11:41] things we know too that God had as we
[11:45] call them attributes
[11:49] amen he he wanted to be a savior am
[11:52] right you said well how do you know
[11:55] because I've experienced it haven't you
[11:57] so he wanted to do that amen now he
[12:00] wanted to be a Healer you say well how
[12:02] do you know cuz I've been healed all
[12:05] right he wanted to be all of those
[12:08] things but how could he display
[12:12] them and be perfect in what he was
[12:15] doing and then as Romans says the thing
[12:18] formed couldn't say why did you make me
[12:21] this
[12:24] way because God doesn't predestinate
[12:27] even by his own desires because the
[12:29] Bible said he desired it all be saved
[12:32] right now if you're going to put it on
[12:34] God remember you keeping it on the right
[12:36] way you're not holding it on some penan
[12:38] deal
[12:41] right but he knew who would want to be
[12:44] saved and who wasn't MH so he could
[12:48] predestinate right amen see we've been
[12:50] dealing now for quite a while for months
[12:54] in speaking of for
[12:56] knowledge the mind uh the thoughts of
[13:00] God and how they're Eternal and he
[13:03] cannot have another thought because if
[13:05] he did he wouldn't be
[13:08] God he can't say something in Genesis
[13:12] and change his mind by the time he gets
[13:14] to the Book of Revelations
[13:16] right right my saying is like this
[13:19] carnal but apply he couldn't start off
[13:21] in Genesis with a white dog wind up in
[13:24] Revelations with a spotted dog and said
[13:26] well I got a dog no he ch
[13:29] changed so that wouldn't be God he said
[13:33] I'm God and I change
[13:35] not therefore the sons of man could be
[13:39] dependent upon him I'm just paraphrasing
[13:42] that scripture right amen that we can
[13:44] depend upon it that he doesn't change
[13:46] that's right so all we got to do is just
[13:49] find his word that speaks to
[13:51] us right and then follow it from that
[13:55] all right and then we can walk right on
[13:57] into what we need to do so he doesn't
[13:59] predestinate by
[14:02] desires he predestines by forn knowledge
[14:05] right all right now but for knowledge
[14:09] remember is a
[14:11] knowledge of what will take
[14:15] place at a later time right amen right
[14:21] so now we're going to start tonight
[14:23] talking about for knowledge in an odd
[14:26] way a strange way
[14:30] because we're going to start talking
[14:35] about that God had these attributes in
[14:38] him and he wanted them
[14:42] displayed all right now how could he be
[14:45] a
[14:46] Healer when there was nothing sick right
[14:51] right how could he be a savior when
[14:54] there was nothing
[14:56] lost he created angel
[14:59] angels and they worshiped him right that
[15:02] gave him the name God as we call it
[15:06] MH because God means an object of
[15:08] worship so when the Angels worship him
[15:10] that would make him God Amen but that
[15:13] didn't make him savior healer Etc
[15:16] Advocate high priest he has many many
[15:19] titles to him all
[15:22] right so in doing that
[15:27] now
[15:29] we see
[15:30] that for him to display these
[15:35] things
[15:37] that some
[15:39] way they would wind up being somebody
[15:42] that would be
[15:43] lost and would need to be a savior
[15:46] that's right provided somebody would be
[15:50] sick you say well how do you know
[15:52] because we've experienced it right we've
[15:56] lived it that settles a whole point
[15:58] Point all right but
[16:02] now remember he can't make us
[16:08] lost that wouldn't be correct that's
[16:11] right we'll see in a minute about Sin
[16:13] see there's no way that sin that God can
[16:17] do anything in the line of sin right
[16:19] right no
[16:23] right and if he could change his
[16:26] mind you could accuse him of getting
[16:28] close to send
[16:29] him about your your life but now
[16:32] remember you can depend upon it if he if
[16:35] we realize he don't change
[16:38] right all right so then let's start on
[16:43] predestination remember what we said
[16:46] now lay aside all of your thoughts
[16:50] because you've been
[16:52] taught the Presbyterian talk
[16:54] predestination in other words the B
[16:56] Baptist Methodist I mean Baptist pre
[16:59] predestination and Presbyterian and like
[17:02] if if I'm going to step down here well I
[17:05] need to go ahead and get that done
[17:07] because I ain't going to never to reach
[17:08] nothing else till I do that cuz that's
[17:14] predetermined well now where's your for
[17:17] knowledge
[17:20] right you see we backed up in the mind
[17:22] of God and spent many services talking
[17:25] about his mind and his ways of being
[17:28] right
[17:32] mhm now we're going to start talking
[17:34] about
[17:37] predestination and we're going to see
[17:39] that first it's got to become by for
[17:42] knowledge so never forget that now no
[17:46] matter what we talk
[17:48] about remember for knowledge is first
[17:51] amen all right had they took that back
[17:55] there there wouldn't have been a split
[17:56] in the Baptist Church and split over PR
[17:58] destination to Brothers all
[18:01] right this has been a doctrine of
[18:04] mankind since for probably 4 500 years
[18:08] and even longer than that going back
[18:10] into the Catholics and the the uh doings
[18:13] on
[18:16] backward but
[18:20] now as I said then if there's going to
[18:22] be a if he's going to be a
[18:25] savior there's going to have to be
[18:27] somebody lost right mhm now we don't
[18:31] believe in the Mormon Doctrine
[18:34] right if you studied the Mormon
[18:38] Doctrine they believe we was all up in
[18:40] heaven everybody was up there and we
[18:43] decided to come to Earth to be lost and
[18:46] that Jesus would come down and die for
[18:49] us well I don't believe we would all up
[18:51] there right cuz I've been over it and
[18:54] over it and over it the only words you
[18:57] can use back in up in the even the the
[19:00] scholars for their words you know the
[19:03] the great learned ones is the word
[19:05] Elohim you can pronounce it him or
[19:09] him it means self-existing
[19:13] amen so if you're going to believe in
[19:16] God you got to remember there was a time
[19:18] that he existed
[19:22] alone right but then he begin
[19:25] to bring into being
[19:32] things that
[19:33] would uh later be of great
[19:38] value and see in doing that then he
[19:42] would
[19:44] provide the things that
[19:47] would now I hope you follow my
[19:50] thought God will provide the
[19:54] things that can be
[19:57] used
[19:58] to bring about the
[20:01] fall but he doesn't make them
[20:05] wrong right all right
[20:09] amen and we're going to talk about
[20:12] Lucifer son of the morning the Bible
[20:15] calls the anointed cherub yes that Stood
[20:17] Beside the
[20:19] Lord the Bible says he was created
[20:22] perfect that's right in his
[20:26] creation we have another word for him
[20:28] called the devil Lucifer
[20:33] Satan it's just a way of using it but
[20:36] he's called many things in the Bible
[20:38] he's called a serpent he's called the
[20:40] the Devil he's called uh
[20:44] Satan but he starts off as
[20:47] Lucifer the son of the
[20:51] morning all
[20:53] right
[20:56] now he would go from
[21:00] that of being created
[21:05] perfect and remember he was given the
[21:07] same thing you and I were
[21:11] given he was given free moral
[21:15] agency to make his own choice the devil
[21:19] was Lucifer so he wasn't created the
[21:21] devil he wasn't a bad guy to begin with
[21:24] in other words if you want to put it up
[21:26] in the correct order of understanding he
[21:28] was God's right-hand
[21:32] man he was there with the cherubims The
[21:35] Sims of the
[21:40] Angels but God
[21:44] knew that by allowing
[21:47] Satan Lucifer the
[21:52] devil
[21:53] to have a free moral
[21:57] agency
[21:59] a right to
[22:01] choose right free moral agency
[22:04] right that he would go
[22:07] wrong right now THS is for knowledge
[22:11] amen
[22:12] right
[22:14] right God's for knowledge Knew by
[22:17] allowing Satan to come the way he would
[22:21] allow him to
[22:23] come that he would turn out to be the
[22:25] devil right but he couldn't make him the
[22:29] devil he can't make a sinner and send a
[22:32] sinner to hell that's right amen he
[22:35] didn't make
[22:36] sin there's nothing in God for sin to
[22:39] originate from amen come on now I read a
[22:43] little scriptures too but let's don't
[22:44] get into carnality I know the Bible
[22:47] talks about Good and Evil I know the
[22:49] Bible talks about I
[22:51] create good and evil but remember if he
[22:54] created evil he's the same base as you
[22:57] and I are on right I don't mind saying
[23:00] that because you go back and check the
[23:02] original he permitted evil he never
[23:05] created evil I've tried to get you away
[23:08] from those words of creation beginnings
[23:11] and and
[23:13] things he
[23:16] permitted sin to appear
[23:19] amen all right he didn't make
[23:22] it all right now you following with me
[23:25] amen see we're talking about the
[23:27] predestin ation that I told you about 8
[23:30] or 10 sermons ago I said we'll get back
[23:33] down to
[23:35] predestination and then we'll start
[23:37] seeing how valuable it has been to
[23:42] understand for
[23:44] knowledge all
[23:45] right so now by for knowledge he knew
[23:50] when he created the
[23:53] Angels he knew that
[23:56] Lucifer
[23:59] and he created him perfect now right but
[24:02] he knew he would go after his own
[24:05] desires all right we're going to read it
[24:07] in a minute in Revelations
[24:11] 12 but he knew that if he allowed him to
[24:14] do that that he'd get all exalted within
[24:20] himself and that he would
[24:22] lead at least a third of the
[24:26] Angels in into his
[24:29] Doctrine idea
[24:36] concept but my warning is I hope I have
[24:38] time enough to get to the end of the
[24:41] message is just remember Paul
[24:45] said that let Satan through his
[24:49] subtility be able to deceive or begal
[24:53] you and I as he did
[24:56] Eve
[24:58] see he warned us about
[25:00] that so that's the end of the message if
[25:03] I can get to there but don't I'll take
[25:05] it up Sunday all
[25:08] right so now remember he created angels
[25:11] I'm going to read these come down a
[25:13] second but I want a point in your
[25:16] mind he created angels they worshiped
[25:21] him that was
[25:23] nice and according to all of the
[25:26] understanding I've ever been able to
[25:27] read about about him uh he was placed
[25:29] over the northern kingdom and according
[25:31] to Scholars and readers that was the
[25:34] worship Kingdom or part of where worship
[25:38] was
[25:40] great and you just think about
[25:44] worship you mean that Satan would
[25:48] worship
[25:50] God may I quote the
[25:52] prophet he said you can worship God
[25:54] every day your life still be lost right
[25:57] you say no wait just a
[26:00] minute well just find it out check it
[26:05] out amen that's right you can worship
[26:09] all you want to but if you're not born
[26:10] again what good is it right right you go
[26:14] to churches and you see people and my
[26:16] Lord Saturday night they're in a honky
[26:19] tonk drunk or on
[26:21] drugs Sunday morning they go to church
[26:24] they put them on the platform and they
[26:25] singing oh how I love Jesus
[26:29] yeah
[26:32] worship read a story one time of a
[26:34] prostitute or the way she was must have
[26:37] been but she was a strip teas and she'd
[26:40] do a strip teas act in a
[26:43] club and then she'd go talk to the
[26:45] people about getting
[26:48] saved what from
[26:52] yeah
[26:53] see that's Satan through his subtility
[26:57] right has gotten to the minds of people
[27:00] amen all
[27:02] right but now follow with me my
[27:08] thought so
[27:10] then God would permit to come into
[27:15] being the things that would bring about
[27:18] the fall
[27:22] right he would place it in the garden he
[27:25] would do the things to where that
[27:28] all the things could be
[27:31] used and to bring a fall upon mankind
[27:35] but he couldn't make it now to be
[27:37] done he would permit it right all right
[27:42] permit it to come into
[27:45] being they would be two trees as we read
[27:47] during the
[27:50] scriptures there'd be two trees in the
[27:52] garden
[27:56] right one of them is a tree of
[27:59] life and we know that's Jesus Christ am
[28:02] correct all
[28:06] right and there's a tree of knowledge of
[28:08] Good and Evil
[28:11] right those were not apple trees
[28:14] pomegranates peaches or some amen that's
[28:18] why we don't believe that eve eat an
[28:19] apple that's right Apple only give you
[28:22] belly
[28:26] ache we're going to get down to what it
[28:30] is but one of them is a tree of life the
[28:32] other one is a tree of knowledge of Good
[28:34] and Evil
[28:36] amen you know Satan's not all
[28:40] bad you know we think about him the guy
[28:42] with the horns and H with a stick great
[28:45] mix and we think he's down at the hon
[28:47] he's not down at The Honky Tong tonight
[28:49] amen you know where he's at sitting on
[28:52] the fuse right here in
[28:54] church why does he want to go down there
[28:58] right
[29:00] remember he was over the
[29:03] worship he loves good music sure amen
[29:08] he's the author of
[29:12] it you ever heard Amazing
[29:17] Grace sung to the tune of the House of
[29:19] the Rising
[29:22] Sun sounds
[29:24] beautiful but you know what the House of
[29:26] the Rising son is don't
[29:28] you a prostitute house out in Texas I
[29:31] believe it
[29:35] was but yet you put them down and you
[29:37] sing it it sounds
[29:41] beautiful would you just take the words
[29:43] out you can sing the other
[29:46] song
[29:49] Right
[29:51] worship don't forget
[29:53] that but he predestinated now
[29:58] we're going to get into that
[30:00] now so by his for
[30:04] knowledge now listen are you following
[30:07] me
[30:08] right he looked down through and knew
[30:10] that if he created Lucifer they he go
[30:14] wrong
[30:17] right so then he could predestinate
[30:20] amen right now we getting the word
[30:25] predestinate he could set of
[30:30] Destiny he could set Lucifer's Destiny
[30:33] all the way to his
[30:35] destruction and put it in the word amen
[30:38] right he could
[30:40] predestinate he didn't make him the
[30:42] devil
[30:46] right so he could
[30:48] predestinate those
[30:50] angels that would take Satan's lie
[30:53] Lucifer's lie you
[30:56] know and he could predestinate their
[30:59] Destiny
[31:03] amen you know
[31:05] what the ones that fail now we're
[31:08] talking about the Fallen
[31:09] Angels you know that those Fallen Angels
[31:12] is what causes us to have a nature a lot
[31:14] of
[31:15] times the way we are that's what your
[31:18] Prophet said so we'll get back to that
[31:20] one of these
[31:23] days why do we act a certain way why are
[31:26] we certain doings you know like certain
[31:29] things something's motivating us right
[31:33] see those demons that fell for Lucifer
[31:37] are trying our best to drive us away
[31:40] from the word amen right but there were
[31:43] two-thirds of the angels that never
[31:49] fa and the Paul I believe the writing of
[31:52] it it's in the scriptures there that
[31:54] they
[31:55] are ministering SP
[31:58] spirits to minister to the hours of
[32:02] Salvation right that's the Bible
[32:06] right so he could predestinate
[32:12] him and he could have one ready for you
[32:14] when you got
[32:16] saved and he could help you and guide
[32:19] you take care of
[32:23] you you ever come very close to being
[32:26] killed wondering why you wouldn't killed
[32:29] amen
[32:30] amen and you come find out there was an
[32:32] angel there protecting
[32:34] you and other people may even see that
[32:38] angel and try to figure it all out you
[32:43] know predestination now comes into view
[32:46] the prophet said it ain't too bad of a
[32:49] word if you approach it
[32:53] correctly you keep it that he
[32:56] fornew
[32:57] so then he could
[32:59] predestinate Lucifer to be what he'd be
[33:05] right then we'll follow him he could
[33:08] come down as to be in one of those
[33:12] trees standing in the
[33:20] garden but remember he's not the bad guy
[33:23] with the horns that we look at you know
[33:26] right
[33:33] he's a tree of knowledge of Good and
[33:39] Evil right right it's a good tree
[33:46] sometime off of those trees we've come
[33:49] up with a lot of good
[33:51] things we don't have to sit and fan
[33:54] tonight we got an air conditioner
[33:57] y we could ride to church we didn't have
[34:00] to walk
[34:03] right you can get on an our plane and
[34:05] fly to California it's a matter of a few
[34:08] hours see your family fly back home all
[34:12] within one day or
[34:15] less get your schedules right you can
[34:17] just fly out there and see them fly
[34:19] right back good
[34:23] things but think about it now we're
[34:27] going to be talking
[34:29] about God's forn
[34:31] knowledge being transmitted down to
[34:35] earth
[34:37] amen and to see where we're
[34:40] at here in life
[34:44] okay now then in doing
[34:48] that let's just read a few
[34:55] things go ahead brother Joe and let's
[34:57] pull up number
[34:59] one we believe God sent a prophet we
[35:01] believe what he said so we can read what
[35:03] he said don't worry about it amen you
[35:05] believe in John Wesley you're going to
[35:07] read it you believe in Alexander
[35:09] Campbell you're going to read that we
[35:11] believe God sent a prophet amen so we
[35:14] don't strangers to it neither are you
[35:17] right all right preached a message
[35:20] called the Easter seal in
[35:22] 19654 you know paragraph
[35:25] 61 now there's a great statement and I
[35:28] want my Ministry Brothers to try to
[35:30] understand this see in the beginning God
[35:33] the great spirit he wasn't even God then
[35:36] and listen to him just listen to simple
[35:38] seven seventh grade education
[35:42] language and just listen to it in the
[35:45] beginning God the great spirit he wasn't
[35:47] even God right then he was the Eternal
[35:51] one God is an object of worship he had
[35:54] nothing to worship him there was no
[35:57] there was no Angels no nothing just God
[35:59] Alone him alone is eternal but in order
[36:02] to be God there had to be something to
[36:04] worship him so he created angels and
[36:08] beings and cherubims and so forth to
[36:10] worship him his great plan begin to
[36:14] unfold amen now his great
[36:20] plan you remember from Christ The
[36:22] Mystery of God revealed we were talking
[36:24] about that God had a plan and a purpose
[36:26] that's right that he was going to see
[36:29] achieved that's right he was going to
[36:32] have a
[36:34] people that wouldn't fall like he fell
[36:39] right she's going to take the word and
[36:41] stand on it
[36:44] amen all right she's
[36:47] predestinated yes to do that so I don't
[36:51] have no problem using the word
[36:53] then because all of it is dealing with
[36:55] for knowledge but watch his great plan
[37:00] unfold
[37:02] plan this plan is going to have to do
[37:05] with these two
[37:06] trees because we're going to drop from
[37:08] there down into the Earth in a
[37:14] second but remember
[37:17] now God had a plan
[37:20] yes his plan was not now listen
[37:25] carefully his plan was not for man to be
[37:28] lost so he could save him that's
[37:32] right no way no now if you believe in
[37:36] that kind of a god you sure got a messed
[37:37] up God and you also got a messed up mind
[37:40] so you need help on both lines I don't
[37:43] mind talking plain right I'm not
[37:45] deceiving nobody right right amen I'm
[37:48] just talking
[37:51] plain he never planned for man to be
[37:54] lost right
[37:58] but by his for knowledge he knew what
[38:01] would take place that's
[38:04] right his plan was to reveal himself to
[38:10] his
[38:11] family if he was to be a
[38:16] father if he was to be a savior A
[38:21] Healer that was his
[38:23] attributes and to be his father would
[38:26] mean that he would have a
[38:28] family
[38:31] right I Don't Call Him Father just cause
[38:34] it's some out of the way
[38:37] word some n name has been tacked on him
[38:40] he's my father amen
[38:43] amen because I'm talking about a
[38:45] spiritual Kingdom that's right amen not
[38:47] a
[38:48] natural all
[38:50] right we see his plan was to reveal
[38:55] himself to bring mankind into
[38:59] being give us a free Mor
[39:04] agency and reveal himself to
[39:07] us and for 6,000 years that's what he's
[39:10] been
[39:11] doing he done it for four and then come
[39:13] in flesh 2,000 years ago Amen to make
[39:17] yourself
[39:22] known but remember his great plan is to
[39:27] reveal
[39:29] himself but to do that he had to permit
[39:32] the other side to come into being amen
[39:35] are you following
[39:36] me
[39:38] okay now then watch what he
[39:41] says look at number two there well let's
[39:43] see yeah go
[39:48] ahead let's read number two then we'll
[39:50] go to the other one I gave him to
[39:52] brother Joe in a certain order go with
[39:55] number two and then we'll back up to 18
[39:56] okay brother
[39:58] Jo he should take him to the baptism of
[40:00] the Holy Spirit preached in
[40:02] 1958 928 the morning
[40:10] service before there was a world Jesus
[40:13] Christ died to save it amen you believe
[40:15] that cuz the Bible said you know died
[40:17] for the foundation of the world now we
[40:18] know he didn't physically die in 2,000
[40:20] years ago but in God's mind amen that's
[40:22] where we've been all this time in God's
[40:24] mind right right and what why did God
[40:26] the infinite God ever permit
[40:31] sin why did he permit
[40:34] sin you know there's attributes in
[40:38] Gods and if God would have never
[40:40] permitted
[40:42] Satan watch you he knew when he created
[40:46] Lucifer that he was to be the one to
[40:49] corrupt the world now if he didn't know
[40:51] that he not God so just forget it go
[40:53] home eat drink be married you're
[40:55] glorified among anyway off a Darwin
[40:57] street now we don't believe in junk do
[41:00] we that's right that's why I make
[41:01] statements like
[41:03] that be happy live and die forget it if
[41:06] you don't believe in God
[41:11] correctly he knew Lucifer if he created
[41:16] him God's got God's not something like
[41:19] pushed off in one corner but he's
[41:21] infinite God who never had a beginning
[41:24] or never will have an end and in him him
[41:27] is in his ATT and in him he is in his
[41:30] attributes is a
[41:32] savior how could he ever be known as
[41:34] Savior if it hadn't been something to
[41:37] save how would have ever been
[41:41] known so
[41:43] now what
[41:46] happened go back to one a brother
[41:51] Jo Revelations 12 and let's read what
[41:55] happened
[41:58] all
[42:00] right now don't get massively confused
[42:03] in Revelations 12 is compound
[42:06] meanings okay so if you don't understand
[42:09] that call me I'll tell
[42:12] you Revelations 12 7-9 says and there
[42:16] was war in heaven now war never begun on
[42:19] Earth we go to it in the minute sin
[42:20] never beun on
[42:22] earth now boy I tell you what I ain't
[42:25] never heard nothing like that seeing up
[42:26] in heaven well you tell me where it come
[42:31] from all right there was war in heaven
[42:34] Michael and his angels fought against
[42:35] the dragon and the dragon fought in his
[42:38] angel now the dragon is Satan the
[42:40] serpent the Lucifer the devil
[42:44] okay Michael is
[42:47] Christ all right now that's over in
[42:50] Daniel where it says Michael you're
[42:55] archangel
[42:57] but Satan was fighting but he prevailed
[43:00] not neither there was Place found
[43:02] anymore neither was there t h e i
[43:06] r those angels and that devil was cast
[43:09] out of Heaven amen all there's place no
[43:13] more found and the Great Dragon was cast
[43:16] out that old serpent called the devil
[43:20] and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[43:23] world he was cast out into the Earth and
[43:25] his Ang Angels were cast out with
[43:27] him all right so what
[43:32] happens he comes to
[43:34] Earth to the Garden yep he's cast out
[43:38] amen so look at the next one the prophet
[43:40] would tell you from that day on Calvary
[43:42] number three 69:25 paragraph
[43:48] 45 sin did not start on the
[43:52] earth sin started in heaven right right
[43:56] see Lucifer was the original unbeliever
[43:59] cuz what is sin right sin's not smoking
[44:03] gambling running around with women
[44:05] that's attributes you do that because
[44:07] you're an
[44:09] unbeliever sin is unbelief he that
[44:12] believeth not Jesus said is condemned
[44:15] already am amen right so what is sin
[44:19] unbelief so sin did not start on the
[44:21] earth sin started in heaven Lucifer the
[44:24] devil was condemned was The Condemned
[44:26] creature for his Disobedience before he
[44:28] ever struck the Earth sin began in
[44:31] heaven where God put the angels and so
[44:33] forth upon the same basis that he put
[44:35] human beings
[44:37] on now
[44:39] what what basis he put him on knowledge
[44:42] of the tree of
[44:45] knowledge the tree of life and the tree
[44:48] of knowledge where man could take his
[44:51] choice and Lucifer was given the
[44:54] premiss premises
[44:58] every to make his
[45:00] choice he wanted something better than
[45:03] God had that started to
[45:05] trouble and what happened he fell to
[45:09] earth when he fell to
[45:11] Earth in the garden
[45:14] amen all right now we come to where we
[45:16] read while
[45:20] ago that man was created put upon the
[45:24] Earth you know
[45:26] we'll get back to all the other part
[45:28] about Eve being taken from Adam Etc but
[45:31] they were there and they were
[45:33] told that they could have eat every tree
[45:36] in the
[45:37] garden except for one
[45:39] tree that was a tree of knowledge of
[45:42] Good and
[45:44] Evil now you know yourself has been
[45:46] taught to you all your life that Eve ate
[45:48] an
[45:49] apple and it caused to
[45:54] fall now I think it's about time to get
[45:57] out of our dumbness let alone our
[46:02] stupidity if eating apples make you find
[46:05] out you're naked we need to get a a
[46:09] couple of billion bushels and start pour
[46:12] them
[46:15] out
[46:16] right well no they don't believe that
[46:18] they BL you ate a
[46:23] pomegranate right don't want to get too
[46:26] far into that because I'm W to hold one
[46:28] thing I'm wanting to hold to the point
[46:31] that showing you and you and I looking
[46:33] at God by his forn knowledge knew if he
[46:37] allowed Satan to come into
[46:40] being that he would go the wrong way and
[46:43] he would come straight to the Earth and
[46:46] he would
[46:49] attack the people on
[46:52] Earth and we keep on attacking them
[46:58] until the end to where it's full
[47:00] completely Clos it out all right but now
[47:04] there was two trees in the
[47:07] garden you can eat of all the trees just
[47:10] leave that tree of knowledge a good and
[47:11] evil
[47:14] along what about having a big old
[47:16] Vineyard a great big thing with apples
[47:18] pomegranate peaches PES plumps all kind
[47:21] of fruit I mean just everything and
[47:24] there's one tree and you told just don't
[47:27] foot with that tree that's
[47:32] right you think we wouldn't be dumb
[47:35] enough to do
[47:39] it but if we could get a little bit of
[47:41] knowledge how good that Apple was on
[47:44] that
[47:45] tree we might want to bite out of
[47:49] it but they wouldn't
[47:53] trees show me a tree of knowledge of
[47:56] Good and Evil that's right that's all I
[47:59] want to
[48:01] see any tree you
[48:04] name Oak Plum Peach
[48:09] P
[48:11] figs peon anything some good
[48:15] right but where's there a tree that's
[48:17] called a tree of knowledge of Good and
[48:18] Evil
[48:21] amen where's that tree that you can eat
[48:24] off of and Get Smart
[48:29] no you get fat you get the belly EG you
[48:33] get all kind of things but you don't get
[48:35] smart amen right right right so now us
[48:40] deal with who them two trees are
[48:44] right and think about
[48:47] them cuz they're going to be in
[48:49] relationship to mankind right or they
[48:52] would not have been in the garden that's
[48:53] right m you think of Adam and how great
[48:57] he was we covered
[48:58] our
[49:00] Sunday he had control of the
[49:04] animals he was the god of the earth amen
[49:08] he was right amen he wasn't the god of
[49:10] Heaven no we don't believe in that the
[49:13] god of the heaven is God
[49:16] himself but he was God of the
[49:19] earth you know that we're still in
[49:22] control of the earth
[49:24] amen
[49:26] you fly over to Africa you jump out as
[49:28] long as ain't something wrong with him
[49:30] you jump out and you run out there and
[49:31] there a big old line he just takes off
[49:35] running bck old
[49:37] elephant he goes
[49:39] running
[49:46] why because he knows there's something
[49:48] about
[49:49] that one that's in front of him that's
[49:52] different than they
[49:54] are man was made a marvelous thing as we
[49:57] talked about
[49:59] Sunday God put to Genesis 1:26 man end
[50:03] of that 27 man that's right breath in
[50:06] his nostrils and he become a living
[50:08] Soul
[50:10] amen he was controller of the earth
[50:13] that's
[50:17] right but yet this one
[50:22] that had his Creation in Beauty and
[50:28] wonderful he's also the deceiver amen
[50:32] and he comes down to
[50:35] earth and when he comes to
[50:37] Earth he's dwelling there and see we
[50:41] look at it like
[50:43] trees well okay I've asked for a tree of
[50:49] knowledge I want to see a tree of
[50:52] knowledge I'd also like to see a tree of
[50:55] life
[50:56] right is there any tree we can eat of to
[50:59] get
[51:00] young they do we need
[51:04] it is any tree that we can need of to
[51:07] live
[51:12] forever right
[51:14] right not quite so it's not dealing with
[51:20] that so let's read a little bit just a
[51:23] few things then we'll start preaching
[51:25] well go ahead to number four brother Joe
[51:28] Ephesian Church age 1960
[51:30] 1205 paragraph
[51:35] 250 Jesus he was talking about Jesus
[51:38] being the the bread of life you remember
[51:42] that in the scripture right he said if
[51:44] you'll eat of this bread you'll live
[51:46] forever amen now what was Jesus talking
[51:49] about was it a certain baked bread that
[51:51] he made a Kentucky Fried Chicken you
[51:54] know
[51:57] or was it even to eat his own body
[52:01] right that couldn't have give no life to
[52:04] nobody but he said he was the bread that
[52:06] come down in the wilderness right right
[52:09] am I quoting
[52:12] scripture what came down in the
[52:14] wilderness
[52:17] Mana but it
[52:19] tyed
[52:21] Christ right so aren't you following him
[52:26] if a man eats this bread he shall never
[52:28] die will this man give his will this man
[52:32] give his body to eat they said now he's
[52:35] mad sure
[52:37] enough the bread of life was from the
[52:40] Tree of
[52:42] Life listen which they were eating from
[52:45] the Garden of
[52:47] Eden he was the tree of
[52:49] life now where to know that anybody
[52:52] Bible readers know that Jesus Christ is
[52:54] the Tree of Life the bread amen all
[52:58] right
[52:59] now now the tree of life was a person
[53:03] amen
[53:05] right right that's right the person of
[53:08] Jesus
[53:09] Christ the only author of Life the only
[53:12] ability to receive
[53:14] life not a bread we
[53:17] eat we just took communion Sunday not a
[53:20] wine you drink that's his blood and a
[53:22] body that bread that you eat that's his
[53:24] body those are symb
[53:26] olcs nothing
[53:28] real
[53:30] symbolics he was the symbol of the bread
[53:32] that came down in the wilderness he was
[53:35] The Giver of Life right but now watch he
[53:39] was the tree of
[53:42] life if the tree of life was a
[53:46] person then the tree of
[53:48] knowledge was a person that's right
[53:51] right
[53:53] right who are those those two
[53:57] persons go ahead to number
[54:01] five which is Page 102 Ephesian Church
[54:04] age book Church Ephesian Church age in
[54:07] the church age
[54:08] book now we have come this far let me
[54:11] try to crystalize your thinking on this
[54:13] subject so you can see the necessity of
[54:15] going into the serpent Seed doctrine as
[54:18] I have we start with the fact that there
[54:20] were two trees in the midst of the
[54:22] garden the tree of life was Jesus the
[54:25] other tree is definitely Satan because
[54:28] of what came forth from the fruit of
[54:29] that tree amen now that should be
[54:31] sensual amen does that need any great
[54:34] light bub to turn on sensible seventh
[54:37] grade education language right right but
[54:40] a prophet of God
[54:42] what now then we know that both of these
[54:45] trees had a relationship to man or they
[54:48] would never have been placed there they
[54:51] must have had a part in The Sovereign
[54:53] plan and purpose of God in their
[54:55] relationship to the
[54:57] Mankind and to
[55:01] himself or we could never impute
[55:05] omnicient unto God this is all true so
[55:08] far is it not now the word must
[55:11] definitely set forth that from before
[55:14] the foundation of the world the purpose
[55:16] of God he goes on according to election
[55:20] and goes on
[55:22] down but these two trees
[55:27] amen sir have a definitely Rel
[55:29] relationship to
[55:33] man it's easily to
[55:38] establish and no one would argue the
[55:41] point that Jesus Christ was the Tree of
[55:43] Life in symbolic speaking
[55:48] right why because there is no life
[55:50] without him
[55:52] am he was the bread that come down from
[55:54] heaven
[55:55] Heaven is all
[55:58] things well then what would be the tree
[56:00] of knowledge why would it be so a
[56:03] commandment if it's just some form of
[56:05] head knowledge or thoughts you know of
[56:08] good points why would it be so bad to
[56:10] prot take of the tree of
[56:15] knowledge knowledge is wonderful as long
[56:18] as it's not contrary to God's
[56:23] word I said we rode in a car coming to
[56:26] church we didn't have to walk that's
[56:27] knowledge is
[56:31] good but when it takes the place of God
[56:36] right all right so then in the garden
[56:39] was two persons standing
[56:42] there one of them was Jesus
[56:45] Christ the other one was Lucifer
[56:48] am the devil
[56:51] Satan all
[56:53] right go on brother Joe with the next
[56:58] one so it will prove the point of what
[57:00] we're talking
[57:01] about page 97 of the Ephesian Church
[57:05] age but what is the Tree of Life well
[57:09] first of all we know first of all we
[57:11] would have to know what the tree itself
[57:14] stands for what in numbers 24 and 6 as
[57:19] balam described Israel he said they were
[57:22] tree aign AO which the Lord ha
[57:29] planted he's
[57:31] calling the People
[57:34] Trees you remember the man that was
[57:35] prayed for there in the Bible and he
[57:37] opened it and he he began he said that
[57:39] he
[57:40] seen people walking but he said it's
[57:42] like trees
[57:44] moving but yet here see trees throughout
[57:47] the Bible or the scripture refer to
[57:50] persons that's Psalms 1 you know Psalms
[57:53] 1 what is it
[57:55] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[57:58] rivers of water
[58:01] right so trees are referring thus the
[58:04] Tree of Life must be the person of life
[58:07] and that is Jesus that'd be easy to
[58:09] accept but what about the tree of
[58:11] knowledge of Good and Evil
[58:15] amen it would have to
[58:19] be the Devil
[58:23] Himself
[58:26] two
[58:28] trees look at the next
[58:31] one 9
[58:34] 98 Ephesian Church
[58:38] 8 all right if the tree of life is a
[58:41] person then the tree of knowledge of
[58:43] Good and Evil is a person also it can't
[58:46] be otherwise thus the righteous one and
[58:48] the wicked one stood side by side there
[58:50] in the midst of the Garden of Eden read
[58:53] it Ezekiel 28:13 read
[58:56] it thou Satan H has been in Eden the
[58:59] Garden of
[59:02] God all right Satan was in the garden y
[59:07] two
[59:09] trees all
[59:13] right with Mankind in the
[59:18] garden look at the next one expectations
[59:21] 1958 503
[59:23] 508
[59:26] E20 and in this lifetime if we have a CH
[59:29] chance to choose right and wrong it's
[59:32] back to the same like it like it was in
[59:34] Eden a man and a woman given a choice to
[59:37] do right or do wrong they have two trees
[59:41] before
[59:42] them we are taught in the
[59:45] scripture one of them was the Tree of
[59:47] Life the other was a tree of knowledge
[59:50] man chose to eat off the tree of
[59:52] knowledge and the first time he at ate
[59:54] from that that tree he severed his
[59:57] friendship with
[59:58] God you remember what happened when they
[1:00:01] ate of the tree of knowledge right God
[1:00:03] come down in the cool of the day and
[1:00:05] Adam and Eve was hiding making them some
[1:00:07] fig leaves clothing you know now if it
[1:00:10] was Apples why did they want clothes to
[1:00:13] put on right
[1:00:15] amen amen right right if you can't see
[1:00:18] what happened in the garden that's right
[1:00:20] from that then you're blind just put it
[1:00:22] that way that's right that ain't
[1:00:24] throwing off nobody it's just blind
[1:00:29] thinking the other one was a true of
[1:00:31] knowledge man chose to eat off the tree
[1:00:32] of knowledge the first time he ate from
[1:00:34] that tree he SED his friendship with God
[1:00:38] and he was made a mortal being he
[1:00:40] brought down since then man has desired
[1:00:43] to live from that tree of knowledge and
[1:00:46] he's done great things but knowledge
[1:00:48] only can reach so far knowledge is all
[1:00:52] right but when you've reached the the
[1:00:54] end of your
[1:00:55] knowledge then believe on their
[1:01:00] own tree of
[1:01:02] knowledge you know the tree of
[1:01:05] knowledge was able to
[1:01:08] produce uh the ability to make
[1:01:12] a languages and write Bibles right
[1:01:19] sure
[1:01:21] right the tree of knowledge we wouldn't
[1:01:24] we wouldn't have this like this if they
[1:01:26] hadn't to come up with the printing
[1:01:27] presses and etc etc and finally got it
[1:01:30] where they can print it for us tree of
[1:01:33] knowledge is fine all right but think
[1:01:36] about
[1:01:43] it let's jump over and then we'll come
[1:01:46] back to these
[1:01:50] later Eve begin to stop and reason
[1:01:58] now there was no
[1:02:01] snake in the
[1:02:04] garden the Bible says
[1:02:07] it the serpent was the most subtle of
[1:02:10] all
[1:02:11] Beast a serpent is a snake a beast is an
[1:02:15] upright
[1:02:17] creature right right
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:22] right the serpent is a symbolic of Satan
[1:02:29] right the serpent from the
[1:02:32] garden all
[1:02:35] right Eve be to reason with that old
[1:02:39] snake that's something ain't it snake
[1:02:41] laying up in an apple tree with a Big
[1:02:43] Apple in his
[1:02:48] mouth come on that's
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:55] and he starts talking to
[1:02:58] Eve and he says you can eat of every
[1:03:01] tree in the garden she said every one of
[1:03:05] them but one now am I reading the
[1:03:07] scripture you want to read it she become
[1:03:10] a good woman
[1:03:14] preacher that's why the Bible forbids
[1:03:16] her to preach that's right amen cuz she
[1:03:18] was also the first one deceived y right
[1:03:21] now you can like it or lump it but a
[1:03:23] woman's easier to deceive than a man
[1:03:24] anytime why because that's the side of
[1:03:26] her brain that works on
[1:03:30] emotional emotional
[1:03:34] side you just picture in the garden that
[1:03:37] old snake running around there trying to
[1:03:39] talk to
[1:03:41] Adam right if you going to make it a
[1:03:44] snake and had him talking to Adam Adam
[1:03:46] ain't going to listen to
[1:03:50] him but Eve began to
[1:03:53] listen
[1:03:55] right and she took her free moral agency
[1:03:57] to listen she was
[1:04:00] told to leave that tree alone right but
[1:04:04] it's like I
[1:04:05] said you tell them kids now go home and
[1:04:09] try it you tell them
[1:04:11] kids you can touch anything in this
[1:04:13] house but leave that lamp
[1:04:18] alone you might as well go buy you
[1:04:20] another
[1:04:22] one right
[1:04:25] where's the kid
[1:04:29] going the best thing to do is to tell
[1:04:31] them you can handle that lamp all you
[1:04:33] want
[1:04:35] to and then won't fool with it you know
[1:04:39] but when you make it
[1:04:44] tantalizing everybody wants to know what
[1:04:46] it
[1:04:47] is we're not going to get into the seat
[1:04:50] of the serpent tonight we're just
[1:04:52] talking on one thing
[1:04:57] Satan through the ability that he had
[1:04:59] was able to talk to Eve
[1:05:05] right that wasn't no snake crawling
[1:05:08] around right the Bible says the serpent
[1:05:13] was the most subtle of all Beast right
[1:05:16] he was an upright creature walking
[1:05:19] around in the garden that looked just
[1:05:21] exactly like man right now to show you
[1:05:24] one more Point that's why Darwin can
[1:05:27] never find a missing link between man
[1:05:31] and the monkey but if he read the Bible
[1:05:34] right right that's right right amen he
[1:05:37] could come all the way up to the monkey
[1:05:39] but he couldn't cross from the monkey to
[1:05:41] the man right if he'd read the Bible he
[1:05:44] would have found a beast standing there
[1:05:50] amen read your Bible he was made a
[1:05:55] snake
[1:05:57] re on thy belly shalt thou go and dust
[1:06:02] shall be thy
[1:06:05] meat he wouldn't no snake to start with
[1:06:09] that's right
[1:06:11] amen he was an upright creature a
[1:06:15] manen walking around in the
[1:06:18] garden and the devil began to talk to
[1:06:23] him
[1:06:25] the only problem with that Beast was
[1:06:28] that Beast never had a
[1:06:30] soul right he'd have been brought up
[1:06:33] into the human race if he had have
[1:06:35] been he was didn't have a
[1:06:38] soul it was just like all the rest of
[1:06:40] the animals but he can be used amen you
[1:06:45] said animals can talk come on get home
[1:06:47] turn the TV on you'll find dogs talking
[1:06:51] horses
[1:06:53] Counting
[1:06:58] right and if you think animals can't be
[1:07:02] used uh I thought bam was riding on a
[1:07:05] donkey one day that the old donkey
[1:07:07] started talking to
[1:07:09] him am I in the
[1:07:11] Bible he said I've been you I encourage
[1:07:13] you all over the place while you be
[1:07:16] me he said if you look right over there
[1:07:19] there's an angel standing there with a
[1:07:21] sword fixing to kill you yeah
[1:07:24] P wait a
[1:07:28] minute but see Satan got into he entered
[1:07:31] into that Beast Amen in the form to talk
[1:07:36] amen now let's get plain and get a short
[1:07:40] part of my message and
[1:07:43] quit what's the most
[1:07:45] deceiving Place position Etc that Satan
[1:07:49] could be using
[1:07:52] today
[1:07:54] the preachers in the pull
[1:07:57] pit now you tell me that ain't right
[1:08:00] that's right amen I'll be glad to open
[1:08:02] the office to you for the rest of the
[1:08:04] night you tell me that the worst thing
[1:08:08] is not a
[1:08:10] preacher the Bible
[1:08:13] said that even Satan's
[1:08:17] Angels or ministering
[1:08:22] spirits
[1:08:27] right let's read the last one and
[1:08:31] quit see Satan said you can eat of every
[1:08:36] tree he said no wait wait just a minute
[1:08:39] now let me straighten you out on
[1:08:41] that good woman preacher right
[1:08:44] yeah now you ain't going to get me to go
[1:08:46] tell no woman preacher she ain't called
[1:08:48] to preach cuz that's her
[1:08:50] business she just ain't going to preach
[1:08:51] here that's right
[1:08:54] as long as I'm here she ain't going to
[1:08:55] preach
[1:09:00] here but the worst part of it is a bunch
[1:09:02] of perverted men preachers with women's
[1:09:05] preacher spirits on right that's it so
[1:09:07] you'll know what I don't like right
[1:09:12] amen and see the Beast begin to talk to
[1:09:18] Eve and she begin to straighten him
[1:09:21] out ain't that what women like to do
[1:09:26] come
[1:09:29] on straighten you
[1:09:32] out he said what about men do too so
[1:09:35] don't worry about
[1:09:37] it but you get a hard-headed woman you
[1:09:39] ain't going to convince her now you can
[1:09:41] do what you want to you can knock a man
[1:09:43] in the head and he'll change his
[1:09:45] mind at least he won't talk in front of
[1:09:47] you you ain't allowed to hit the woman
[1:09:49] so you can't do nothing that way you get
[1:09:51] a hard-headed woman you ain't going to
[1:09:52] convince her about nothing
[1:09:54] amen the Bible
[1:09:56] says that Eve still thinks she's
[1:10:01] right that's right amen right come
[1:10:06] on so what is it let's get one more
[1:10:10] scripture and then we'll quit
[1:10:13] okay go ahead with 2 Corinthians
[1:10:16] 11
[1:10:22] Jo
[1:10:25] Paul said for I'm jealous over you with
[1:10:27] Godly jealousy for I have espoused you
[1:10:30] to one
[1:10:31] husband one God we don't believe in a
[1:10:34] trinity amen the word Trinity is not in
[1:10:36] the Bible we laugh in the other day
[1:10:38] somebody was watching somebody to one of
[1:10:40] the visitors and I said there ain't no
[1:10:42] word Trinity in the
[1:10:44] Bible and somebody happened to be
[1:10:46] looking over and they was going they
[1:10:49] went back into the the uh concordance
[1:10:51] thing in the back in the Bible
[1:10:55] then he just folded it up you couldn't
[1:10:58] find
[1:10:59] Trinity there ain't no Trinity in the
[1:11:02] Bible we don't believe in a trinity we
[1:11:05] believe in one true and living God and
[1:11:08] Jesus is that God that's not Oneness
[1:11:11] because we believe Father Son and Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost makes the one true and living God
[1:11:17] there was a time he was manifesting
[1:11:18] himself as the father and even the Holy
[1:11:22] Spirit now in I mean the son now in the
[1:11:24] Holy Spirit the same God Amen not three
[1:11:28] Gods believe in one true and living God
[1:11:30] that's why we're gonna get to it that's
[1:11:31] what Paul's
[1:11:33] saying I have espoused you I've wed you
[1:11:36] I've taught you I've brought you to the
[1:11:39] understanding of one husband that's
[1:11:42] Christ amen right he's the head of all
[1:11:44] things is that what Paul said that's
[1:11:47] right that's why we baptize in the name
[1:11:49] of the Lord Jesus Christ not father son
[1:11:51] Holy Ghost show it to me in the
[1:11:55] Bible show me in the Bible anybody's
[1:11:58] ever baptized father son Holy Ghost and
[1:12:01] I'll give you $10,000
[1:12:03] amen that ain't exalted or smart ellic
[1:12:06] that's just showing you how sure right
[1:12:09] amen the word of God
[1:12:12] is well Matthew 28:19 yeah read it let
[1:12:16] go baptized in the name of the father
[1:12:18] and of the son and of the Holy
[1:12:20] Spirit that's and when I baptize you
[1:12:23] that's way I do it I said to fulfill
[1:12:25] that Great Commission to baptize you
[1:12:28] according to the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:12:29] said to baptize you in the name of the
[1:12:31] father and of the son and of the Holy
[1:12:34] Spirit I now baptize thee my brother in
[1:12:37] the or sister what in the name of the
[1:12:39] Lord Jesus Christ right that's right
[1:12:43] right if you ain't been baptized in the
[1:12:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ your
[1:12:46] baptism come in the Catholic church
[1:12:48] that's right so go ahead stay with Mama
[1:12:51] that's right that's right you see I
[1:12:52] don't have to be be re baptized I was
[1:12:54] sincere when I got
[1:12:56] baptized so were there in the Bible when
[1:13:00] they were baptized under
[1:13:01] John but when they come into the new
[1:13:04] they had to be baptized again so come on
[1:13:08] look what he said but I fear
[1:13:11] right L by any means as the serpent
[1:13:15] begot
[1:13:17] Eve through his
[1:13:21] subtility you know what he told her
[1:13:25] he said God and Adam's keeping it from
[1:13:29] you I said you were made to
[1:13:36] reproduce and she went right after it y
[1:13:40] now you tell me they wasn't two kids
[1:13:42] born from one you got one act from Adam
[1:13:44] and two kids
[1:13:47] born one of them was Cain the other one
[1:13:50] was
[1:13:51] Abel Abel followed Adam's lineage Cain
[1:13:56] where did he get that nastiness to kill
[1:13:59] his brother amen that's
[1:14:01] right from his daddy come on so your
[1:14:05] mind should be corrupted from the
[1:14:07] Simplicity look that is in
[1:14:15] Christ and folks we're in the worst day
[1:14:18] in the age ever that that could be
[1:14:22] fulfilled
[1:14:24] we're in the age when men in this
[1:14:26] message are taking this message and
[1:14:28] preaching two
[1:14:30] Lords preaching Jesus wouldn't god Till
[1:14:32] The River Jordan
[1:14:34] Etc the Simplicity of
[1:14:37] Christ and they're not holding it
[1:14:40] right and they're making many gods out
[1:14:42] of it that's
[1:14:46] right sounds like Satan has got to Eve
[1:14:50] again the Eve in the last day the
[1:14:56] church was that what Paul was afraid
[1:14:59] of the Simplicity that's in
[1:15:04] Christ what about a man could stand up
[1:15:07] what about brother brandom standing
[1:15:08] there in his day and speaking to
[1:15:11] theologians that could wrap him up with
[1:15:14] newspaper work where all of their their
[1:15:16] big you know they've been to
[1:15:18] school and he says listen said the Bible
[1:15:21] says now you you remember this the
[1:15:23] script says the Eternal godhead can be
[1:15:25] understood by the things we see right
[1:15:28] now is that scripture brother
[1:15:30] cor be understood by the things we see
[1:15:34] what is it one God I am a father I am a
[1:15:39] son I am a human being I have many
[1:15:42] manifestations to me that is the
[1:15:45] Simplicity of Christ
[1:15:48] Jesus
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:55] but you see there's where men go the
[1:15:57] wrong way go ahead brother Joel pull
[1:15:58] that back up because I ain't
[1:16:03] finished I want to ask you what you
[1:16:05] think about this
[1:16:08] scripture pull pull it back up brother
[1:16:11] Joe 2
[1:16:12] Corinthians
[1:16:15] 11 what do you think about that
[1:16:18] scripture for he that cometh preaching
[1:16:20] another
[1:16:22] Jesus
[1:16:23] whom we have not
[1:16:25] preached know words another God another
[1:16:28] way another Doctrine besides what he was
[1:16:30] preaching what did he say in Galatians
[1:16:32] is it galatians: 18 where he says that
[1:16:34] no it's not Galatians but it where he
[1:16:37] said let him be condemned if he got any
[1:16:39] other Doctrine than what I've brought
[1:16:41] all
[1:16:43] right Galatians 18
[1:16:47] okay for he that cometh preaching
[1:16:49] another Jesus whom we have not preached
[1:16:53] or if you receive another
[1:16:57] Spirit which you have not received now
[1:17:00] what does he
[1:17:01] mean you receive another Spirit which
[1:17:04] you have not
[1:17:08] received my brain's
[1:17:12] going something's being
[1:17:16] said figure it
[1:17:19] out you receive another Spirit which you
[1:17:22] have not received
[1:17:26] okay simple language you receive another
[1:17:29] spirit that we didn't
[1:17:32] preach right
[1:17:35] amen where's that Spirit going to take
[1:17:39] you or another
[1:17:45] gospel which you have not
[1:17:48] accepted now what does it say this
[1:17:51] end you but well bear with
[1:18:01] him I
[1:18:07] don't that sounds
[1:18:11] odd so Paul what are you
[1:18:20] saying are you telling me that
[1:18:25] or another if I receive another gospel
[1:18:28] you might well bear with him you know
[1:18:30] just go with him
[1:18:33] no cuz Paul wouldn't tell you to go with
[1:18:36] him right
[1:18:40] right what is it
[1:18:43] saying you see there's where I come up
[1:18:45] against the wall and I stand there and I
[1:18:47] said
[1:18:49] Lord
[1:18:51] now
[1:18:54] you said
[1:18:55] something what' you say
[1:18:58] right you
[1:19:00] said if a man comes preaching another
[1:19:04] Jesus and we have not received or if you
[1:19:07] receive another
[1:19:12] Spirit which you have not
[1:19:16] received or another
[1:19:18] gospel which you have not
[1:19:21] accepted is he saying Just Go With It Go
[1:19:25] with
[1:19:26] it now that's not Paul uh so I searched
[1:19:30] and I
[1:19:41] searched Knox was the best understanding
[1:19:43] that I could get the Bible the Knox
[1:19:50] understanding he said Paul is saying
[1:19:55] if somebody comes along here with all
[1:19:56] these other
[1:19:58] doctrines all these other spirits and
[1:20:00] all these other
[1:20:04] gospel he said what you need to
[1:20:07] do he said you need to bear with
[1:20:13] me you need to be patient with
[1:20:17] me he's not telling you to go with it
[1:20:20] he's telling that you need to be patient
[1:20:22] with him who's trying to explain
[1:20:30] it come
[1:20:32] on Paul is saying bear with me until I
[1:20:37] can explain it to
[1:20:40] you don't go with
[1:20:43] it but if you don't understand be with
[1:20:50] me Church
[1:20:53] I know the way that I preach and the way
[1:20:55] that I do and the things that I tell you
[1:20:58] and I teach
[1:21:01] you but I've never told you to go
[1:21:04] somewhere else and do I've told you to
[1:21:06] bear with
[1:21:10] me bear with me until I can find words
[1:21:13] to explain
[1:21:19] it cuz I'm not talking about another
[1:21:21] gospel I'm not talking about another
[1:21:24] Spirit I'm not talking about another
[1:21:26] God Amen I'm talking about the one true
[1:21:29] and living
[1:21:30] God in Jesus is his
[1:21:35] name bear with
[1:21:38] me until I can get it into better
[1:21:41] words but instead of that I'm called the
[1:21:44] intellects everything in the book but
[1:21:45] that's all right cuz that's got to go
[1:21:47] with it that's right it don't hurt me it
[1:21:49] hurts inside of me because the spirit
[1:21:51] inside of me is trying his best to get
[1:21:54] the truth to you and I
[1:21:57] right bear with
[1:22:00] me because I'm trying to bring Christ to
[1:22:05] you I'm trying to bring it in the garden
[1:22:08] and let you see what this devil is
[1:22:11] doing the devil is now into the mind of
[1:22:14] mankind in the greatest way it could
[1:22:16] ever be cuz he's taking this
[1:22:18] message that's right this message is
[1:22:21] what he's using Y
[1:22:23] ab and
[1:22:26] destroying the gospel
[1:22:30] truth come on brothers let's
[1:22:34] stand two
[1:22:37] trees one is the Tree of
[1:22:40] Life the other one is a tree of
[1:22:43] knowledge knowledge the Bible says
[1:22:45] puffeth
[1:22:48] up but you go look up knowledge now go
[1:22:52] home run in your computer the word
[1:22:55] knowledge in the Bible you know what I
[1:22:57] mean go in the Bible pull up
[1:22:59] knowledge and you'll find only about two
[1:23:02] times of knowledge that it's speaking
[1:23:06] that it's
[1:23:08] bad I really don't know about
[1:23:11] one it says knowledge puffers
[1:23:17] up the rest of them are wonderful
[1:23:21] things
[1:23:23] the knowledge of God is wonderful
[1:23:27] right knowledge and wisdom goes hand in
[1:23:34] hand
[1:23:37] knowledge the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:23:41] and
[1:23:43] Evil but this is the way brother R said
[1:23:46] he'll give Satan will give you just
[1:23:47] enough knowledge to kill
[1:23:51] you why because you think you got it
[1:23:55] figured
[1:23:56] out and you can't figure it out that's
[1:24:02] right there's scriptures in the Bible
[1:24:04] right today that I would not speak on
[1:24:05] none whatsoever because I do not
[1:24:09] understand
[1:24:13] it I will wait until he
[1:24:16] speaks but when I speak then I don't
[1:24:20] fear no problems
