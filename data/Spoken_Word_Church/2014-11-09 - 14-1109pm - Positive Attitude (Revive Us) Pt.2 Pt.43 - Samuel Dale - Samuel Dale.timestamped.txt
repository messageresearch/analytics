[16:19] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[16:20] the lord your god
[16:22] who hath dealt wonderfully wondrously
[16:24] with you
[16:26] and my people shall never be ashamed
[16:29] and ye shall know that i am in the midst
[16:31] of israel that i am the lord your god
[16:34] and none else and what and my people
[16:37] shall never
[16:38] be
[16:39] ashamed you may be seated the lord add
[16:41] his blessing to the reading of the word
[16:46] now to try not to uh
[16:50] back up too far
[16:52] over this morning but to make sure that
[16:55] someone connecting in this afternoon
[16:57] would
[16:58] wonder well you know what was being said
[17:01] and all but
[17:02] you know to just try to get you to look
[17:05] at something we're talking about
[17:08] revival
[17:10] all right signifying a move of god in
[17:12] power
[17:14] and uh i know immediately people will in
[17:16] their mind will say revival's over
[17:20] it was over in 56 well we gave those
[17:22] quotes
[17:23] this morning to showing what the prophet
[17:25] had said
[17:26] and even said there would be no more
[17:28] great
[17:30] uh
[17:30] worldwide sweeping revivals we believe
[17:33] that
[17:35] but then he turned around and we read
[17:37] one this morning from white christ speak
[17:39] that it isn't over
[17:42] the
[17:43] we haven't had the revival yet all right
[17:46] now he's talking about something else
[17:47] then right
[17:49] then we covered how that
[17:51] um you know
[17:53] from this third seal where brother brown
[17:55] said the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[17:58] said he'd take those seven unknown
[18:00] thunders to wake her up
[18:01] well
[18:03] you know
[18:04] we uh
[18:06] we're just trying our best to bring
[18:08] together all of the
[18:10] uh things that have been said
[18:12] and make a beautiful picture
[18:14] and that picture remember is supposed to
[18:16] be
[18:17] uh not just
[18:18] a cow hanging up in a tree and
[18:21] grass growing on a rock and all kinds of
[18:24] things it's supposed to be a beautiful
[18:25] picture with all of the things in place
[18:29] and then once it's put into place then
[18:31] we can follow it throughout the word
[18:34] and the prophet would speak of revivals
[18:36] as it's like services that were going on
[18:39] all right
[18:40] and you know in the many things i hope
[18:42] you were following that this morning
[18:45] and to me then to say
[18:47] the revival's over
[18:49] but then to turn around and say
[18:52] we haven't had a revival yet
[18:54] well you know i believe both of those
[18:56] statements are correct
[18:58] you know
[18:59] and in doing that then we've tried to
[19:02] make ourselves clear about
[19:04] how that there was not going to be any
[19:06] more worldwide sweeping revivals
[19:10] the next time that that move comes would
[19:12] be to israel through the two prophets
[19:14] you know the heavens closed the
[19:16] different things happening
[19:18] and that would be that part but we're
[19:19] not looking for a worldwide sweeping
[19:21] revival
[19:23] but yet at the same time
[19:25] why can't we believe in a revival
[19:27] you know
[19:28] all right
[19:29] and we we ended up talking about
[19:34] that the prophet said that azusa street
[19:36] 1906
[19:38] was the greatest revival
[19:40] you remember that was all for the church
[19:42] choosing law for grace in 61
[19:45] that it's the one of the it was the
[19:47] greatest revival
[19:49] you know since the day of pentecost
[19:52] a worldwide sweeping revival
[19:55] all right it was the promise that we
[19:56] read in the scriptures down to stop and
[19:59] stopped on
[20:00] that he said you know and pour out my
[20:01] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[20:03] daughters to do this that the other your
[20:05] handmaids and all which would be poured
[20:08] out upon everything in the last days and
[20:10] that would be the azusa street
[20:13] revival time
[20:14] that was a great revival he called it
[20:17] the greatest since the day of pentecost
[20:20] all right
[20:20] so we believe that so then it's not just
[20:23] throwing it out with a revival's over
[20:26] well i guess azusa street didn't have
[20:28] one
[20:29] you know and that's the way you you
[20:31] would make people to think
[20:33] but see those things are statements that
[20:36] we use for our own benefit as i said we
[20:39] close our mind off we hear something our
[20:42] mind is closed uh one man said one time
[20:45] he said
[20:46] um our minds are crystallized on this
[20:50] thought
[20:51] i thought
[20:53] you know really you you we're not
[20:55] mechanics never been but but crystal
[20:57] eyes breaks you
[20:59] now we used to we had to because we
[21:01] couldn't do nothing else but we used to
[21:04] take them off and sand them
[21:07] well you know they'd work for about
[21:08] three times putting on the brakes and
[21:10] and then you was right back in the same
[21:13] problem you was because once it's
[21:15] crystallized it won't do no good so if
[21:17] you say your your mind is christianized
[21:19] about a revival
[21:21] there ain't gonna be no revival my
[21:22] mind's crystallized well then
[21:25] cut her off we'll see you next time
[21:27] maybe we'll have a topic later that you
[21:29] can understand
[21:30] you know
[21:31] but
[21:32] see then we think that we are so um
[21:35] revelated
[21:37] and the point right at the lights that i
[21:38] was trying to get across that the zeus
[21:41] street pentecost
[21:44] was as the prophet said the greatest
[21:45] revival since the day of pentecost and
[21:48] yet the people
[21:49] in that
[21:51] was looking forward to something else
[21:54] instead of
[21:55] you know even
[21:56] rejoicing and going on with what they
[21:59] had they was looking for a time to come
[22:02] that there'd be a worldwide sweeping
[22:04] revival and experiencing
[22:07] the greatest that the prophet said had
[22:08] been since pentecost
[22:10] you know well
[22:13] you know that would have been even on up
[22:14] into the 12 13 that was the name of
[22:17] jesus being restored coming on up and
[22:19] coming up to the time of the prophet and
[22:21] and all like that coming into view in
[22:23] the 30s and and things and he speaks of
[22:26] a great that was still a great revival
[22:28] going on
[22:29] you know all right i was telling them
[22:31] while i go downstairs we we baptist and
[22:34] all we didn't have no right to be in no
[22:36] line of our day of revival was over but
[22:40] i can remember in the 50s
[22:42] when that you know i mean you had great
[22:45] things going on
[22:46] and uh you know this is kind of what you
[22:48] call this little
[22:50] missionary baptist style churches
[22:53] but they'd have great times they'd have
[22:55] great healing i mean you know how
[22:57] healings they'd have revivals
[23:00] and things would take place and shouting
[23:02] all over the house and
[23:03] you know and all of that
[23:05] and like i told you i've seen them there
[23:07] at the old church at gillsville
[23:09] and there was a cemetery right behind
[23:11] the church and the men would go down one
[23:13] way and the women would go down the
[23:14] other and the women walked right down in
[23:16] the woods
[23:18] you know what no swept out concrete
[23:20] thing is right down in the woods and get
[23:23] down and have prayer meeting
[23:25] you know
[23:26] well you know we're up there playing but
[23:28] i can still remember
[23:30] that made a mark in my mind that those
[23:33] ladies the men you could understand but
[23:35] you know
[23:36] my point is that there was a great moves
[23:38] and things going on but we baptist was
[23:41] just shouting in the after effects as
[23:42] you'd call it of the pentecostal revival
[23:46] that was taken had taken place
[23:49] but now when the prophet came along
[23:51] he didn't deny that as being true he
[23:54] spoke of it as being true you know good
[23:56] and great
[23:57] all right
[23:59] well we didn't have nothing going on
[24:00] until the prophet came on the scene
[24:03] well
[24:04] you go ahead and talk all you want to
[24:06] about it but you won't fit it in the
[24:08] prophet's message nor the bible
[24:10] all right but now think about it
[24:14] but i want you to get one point
[24:17] i tried to emphasize it a little bit
[24:19] this morning
[24:20] that brother branham would talk about
[24:22] pentecost
[24:24] you know that pentecost begin
[24:26] and will never stop
[24:30] the baptists begin and stop methodist
[24:32] presbyterian the pentecostals
[24:36] began and stopped
[24:39] but the same revival that was in the
[24:41] days of martin luther was the same
[24:43] revival in the days of john wesley just
[24:46] in a little higher form of the word
[24:49] and it keeps going right on down
[24:52] a pentecost revival because pentecost is
[24:55] 50 and that's the holy spirit all right
[24:58] so then we should never worry about that
[25:00] but now
[25:02] all the other things will die away
[25:06] because we find out then that they were
[25:08] not necessarily true that's what we want
[25:10] to deal with just for a second if the
[25:12] brothers will start on number 11 kind of
[25:15] where we got to
[25:17] but look what he says
[25:20] about this
[25:21] and you'll get the point of what i'm
[25:23] trying to drive at
[25:24] might as well put my cough drop in
[25:26] because i'm having troubles with that
[25:29] old sinuses but that's all right
[25:31] all right this is taken from the message
[25:33] of the sumerian church age 1960-1206
[25:36] but you see
[25:38] it was a hybrid thing hybrid see
[25:40] it didn't have any life in it
[25:43] and they cannot go back no more
[25:46] that's the reason they'll never rise
[25:49] the lutheran revival never did rise up
[25:52] again
[25:53] the wesley revival never did rise up
[25:56] again the nazarene revival did not rise
[25:59] up again neither will the pentecostal
[26:01] revival rise up again
[26:04] why
[26:06] because they killed it
[26:08] you hybred it with a world and with a
[26:11] nickelodeon idea
[26:13] not let the holy spirit have its way all
[26:15] right
[26:16] now
[26:19] see
[26:20] but to me now like i just say it
[26:25] pentecost begin without an end
[26:29] you need those statements we're glad to
[26:30] find it
[26:32] and each age was pentecost
[26:35] see
[26:37] each age had a revival
[26:40] each age had a move of god
[26:42] because that's pentecost
[26:44] all right the pentecostals they were
[26:46] having a move of god
[26:48] you know
[26:49] but a lot of them prove that it was
[26:51] wrong
[26:52] by the fact of dying or denominating
[26:57] hybrid
[26:59] and things instead of going on with the
[27:02] word
[27:03] all right
[27:04] see then something happened that was an
[27:07] amazing point
[27:09] all right
[27:11] something took place
[27:13] back in the times of
[27:16] you know
[27:17] when uh when the pentecostal revival
[27:19] began to be dying down
[27:23] that's when the prophet came on the
[27:25] scene
[27:26] all right
[27:28] and as he did
[27:30] now watch worldwide sweeping revivals
[27:32] over with
[27:34] but yet look what he calls the revival
[27:37] of the times of where he was at and what
[27:40] is going on go ahead and pull up the
[27:41] next one which is calling jesus on the
[27:44] scene
[27:46] 1964 319
[27:48] good little bit of reading but just go
[27:50] with me
[27:51] now you have witnessed one of the
[27:52] greatest revivals i believe that the
[27:55] world has ever seen
[27:57] now you're not talking about zeus street
[28:00] he said in these last 10 15 years
[28:05] huh
[28:06] it's been a revival not just like the
[28:08] days of billy sunday
[28:10] watching
[28:11] or the days of the wealth revival
[28:14] are the days of the westland revival
[28:17] or the moody revival or billy's sunday
[28:20] revival
[28:25] it's been a worldwide sweeping of fire
[28:28] around the world
[28:31] great healing services
[28:33] and great revival fires is burnt on
[28:35] practically every hill there is in the
[28:37] world
[28:38] right tonight way over in the land of
[28:40] africa down in china and japan
[28:43] this gospel is being preached and people
[28:46] are being healed
[28:47] right this very minute
[28:49] around and around the world
[28:51] it's been one of the greatest revivals
[28:54] because i believe it's one of the life's
[28:56] revivals
[28:57] this world will see
[28:59] a world sweeping revival
[29:02] well now he's talking about his day
[29:03] right
[29:04] are you with me
[29:07] all right watch them
[29:14] i remember of having what
[29:17] i remember of having the privilege
[29:20] by the holy spirit
[29:22] to spearhead
[29:24] that revival that started
[29:27] now he's not talking about azusa street
[29:31] it's in his day
[29:33] right
[29:34] when the angel the lord appeared on the
[29:35] river and said
[29:37] that about
[29:38] many years ago and to see it happen
[29:41] and see it set ministers hearts of fire
[29:43] everywhere revivals broke out well you
[29:46] could just simply walk into a building
[29:49] and the people just get up out of their
[29:51] scots and stretchers
[29:54] and walk away healed
[29:56] you didn't even have to say one word
[29:59] just just being there
[30:01] that's all it taken
[30:02] i remember one night in
[30:05] vandalia vandela illinois i walked into
[30:08] the meeting and had no more being in the
[30:10] meeting over five minutes
[30:13] and there wasn't a feeble person around
[30:15] the place anywhere
[30:18] what about a great time
[30:21] wheelchairs pushed out and piled up
[30:22] blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking
[30:25] and just simply the spirit of the lord
[30:27] was present and he just healed a whole
[30:29] group of them
[30:30] now that's where you can do something
[30:33] when revival is going on
[30:36] but let that revival fire die down
[30:40] fire die down then you can hardly the
[30:43] people are still christians
[30:45] but they're not revived
[30:47] into that spirit that great atmosphere
[30:50] that goes
[30:51] something all right
[30:53] now bring it on up we'll get the lights
[30:55] and that's what it takes to have a
[30:56] revival
[30:58] is everybody under the heat of the holy
[31:00] spirit that's brought down the powers of
[31:03] god and a revival moving then there is a
[31:06] prior meeting going on day and night
[31:08] every minute everywhere why the people
[31:10] would even wouldn't even leave the
[31:13] grounds all right
[31:15] now
[31:18] he was talking about his own ministry
[31:23] in the time
[31:24] of the great healings
[31:26] see because it was promised in malachi
[31:28] 4.
[31:30] you know
[31:31] behold i send you elijah he'll turn the
[31:33] hearts of the children and but what is
[31:35] right back before then in malachi
[31:39] that the son of righteousness would rise
[31:41] with healings in his wings
[31:44] now listen very carefully
[31:46] for a moment
[31:49] in the pentecostal revival azusa street
[31:52] there was a lot of healings and signs
[31:54] and wonders there is with every revival
[31:57] you know
[31:58] i mean it's always been when a revival
[32:00] goes forth there's always signs and
[32:02] wonders goes with it healings and
[32:04] different things right
[32:06] but never was there an age like
[32:10] we have just passed
[32:12] to work like the prophet said you could
[32:14] just walk right into a building and
[32:16] people be healed
[32:18] why because that was something taking
[32:20] place
[32:21] other than just a reviving
[32:26] there was something taking place in the
[32:28] times of brother branham that was more
[32:29] than reviving
[32:32] you know
[32:33] more than just a move
[32:37] a shouting
[32:40] it was a time of the sign of the
[32:42] resurrection
[32:45] you agree with me
[32:47] the sign of the resurrection that's why
[32:48] he was talking about the son of man
[32:52] all right
[32:53] and it said he would rise with healings
[32:55] in his wings
[32:56] all right
[32:58] see brother branham what most people
[32:59] don't listen to
[33:01] listen to him enough to understand
[33:04] see he preached about 30-something years
[33:07] just as a restoration of us back to the
[33:11] bible
[33:13] that paul and them had preached
[33:15] now i wouldn't the one that said it he
[33:16] goes the future home goes a different
[33:18] one rapture
[33:20] and he said not in the years of
[33:21] preparation but when the message would
[33:24] come forth
[33:25] brother brown's message then began
[33:27] all the rest was restoration
[33:30] but in 1963 when the seals opened he was
[33:33] to bring his message
[33:35] all right but had it not been a rising
[33:38] of the healings in the wings
[33:42] right that was divine healing
[33:46] but at the same time this revival was
[33:49] going on to revive people
[33:53] it was to be the bringing of all of the
[33:56] word
[33:59] right
[34:01] that would be the purpose
[34:03] what did he say he said you don't show
[34:06] them the hook you show them the bait
[34:09] he said the healings and the signs and
[34:10] wonders was the bait
[34:12] for them to get the hook
[34:14] the hook was the preaching of the gospel
[34:17] that's why i read this one to where he
[34:19] said see
[34:22] it comes down to what the word is saying
[34:26] great sweeping times
[34:28] all right
[34:33] and knowing that
[34:34] the great associate street
[34:37] was gone
[34:41] right
[34:43] now i'm talking about the move of azusa
[34:45] street
[34:46] not the pentecost now i explained that a
[34:48] moment ago
[34:50] because brother brown's message goes
[34:51] right on into pentecost
[34:53] the great opening of the word
[34:55] but a split condition took place back
[34:57] there and he would call it the greatest
[35:00] revival or a sweeping revival look at
[35:02] the next one
[35:03] letting off the pressure in 1962.
[35:08] and watch what he's saying
[35:10] now i've kind of listened and watched my
[35:12] pentecostal brethren
[35:13] as they have predicted a sweeping
[35:15] revival coming and we all know that the
[35:18] revival that we just
[35:20] went through
[35:21] has ceased
[35:24] well
[35:25] but there must be coming something else
[35:29] that's glorious
[35:30] and great
[35:34] are you reading
[35:35] and also i've been studying hard to find
[35:38] these places in the scripture
[35:41] i think that if our revelation must be
[35:43] scriptural and then we know it's right
[35:46] it's the scripture it's from the lord
[35:48] and i'm beginning to believe that that's
[35:50] right
[35:51] that there's coming a ripening time
[35:54] for the evening fruits
[35:57] all right
[36:00] then he would have to have
[36:03] the former rain
[36:07] if you need these be glad to get them he
[36:08] said you say you've had a lot of rain he
[36:10] says nonsense
[36:12] he said you haven't had the former rain
[36:14] yet
[36:15] the former rain is the teaching rain
[36:19] all right
[36:20] now this revival
[36:24] now
[36:28] this
[36:31] this today
[36:34] that we're in
[36:37] to me
[36:39] is the greatest of all revivals
[36:45] even the two witnesses after we leave
[36:48] they without us
[36:50] cannot be made perfect
[36:53] right
[36:54] they're depending on us to come to a
[36:56] place
[36:59] right
[37:01] so then every revival
[37:05] now you listen to what i'm saying
[37:07] every revival prior to us
[37:12] where it be
[37:15] the church ages as a revival for each
[37:17] age
[37:19] whether it be the great pentecostal
[37:21] azusa street revival
[37:25] or even whether it be the great
[37:27] healing campaign
[37:29] revival
[37:31] of the 30s to 40s the 50s and into the
[37:34] 60s
[37:36] spearheaded by brother branham's
[37:38] ministry
[37:41] and yet he still says there's something
[37:42] to come
[37:43] come on
[37:48] but you see that's our problem
[37:52] we think
[37:54] if god was with us we'd be seeing great
[37:57] signs and wonders
[38:01] you know
[38:04] remember
[38:07] you are facing
[38:10] the worst
[38:11] attack
[38:14] of any time
[38:18] in the
[38:19] whole bible
[38:20] that has ever been
[38:25] you are facing satan and let me quote
[38:28] brother branham where he says the
[38:30] perfect
[38:31] anti-anointing
[38:36] now that's what he said about it
[38:39] says you're facing him with a perfect
[38:40] anti-anointing in other words the top
[38:42] echelon
[38:45] of all demons
[38:48] has been poured out
[38:50] i'll get to this more in another message
[38:53] but brother branham says
[38:55] the holy ghost had been bound for two
[38:57] thousand years
[38:59] at the door of creeds and
[39:01] dogmas
[39:03] but to be loosed in the evening time
[39:07] by this message
[39:09] all right
[39:12] the worst attack that has ever been
[39:15] is now upon us
[39:19] it would be easier to go back and walk
[39:21] up to a line and slap it until it come
[39:23] on
[39:28] it'd be easier to walk out of a catholic
[39:30] church and face the basis that you're
[39:31] being excommunicated
[39:36] we're in the greatest time
[39:40] that has ever been
[39:43] all of those revivals that you could
[39:45] talk about
[39:47] even down to the one in this day when
[39:50] brother brown said to just walk into a
[39:52] room
[39:53] and everybody and i'd be healed
[40:00] but yet we thank all god was he poured
[40:02] into brother branham all brother branham
[40:04] was he died and took it with him or
[40:05] something you know
[40:10] it's because we've got set in our mind
[40:12] what a revival is
[40:18] to us a revival is a great rejoicing a
[40:21] great this or a great debt
[40:26] i'm trying to tell you
[40:28] the greatest revival there is
[40:32] is the opening of of god's word
[40:40] the opening of god's word to you and i
[40:44] is the greatest revival
[40:47] because it is the cult what do you call
[40:49] it the ending of the
[40:51] the finishing of all revivals
[40:58] is here today
[41:01] and yet we think well i don't see no
[41:02] revival going on
[41:04] you know why you don't see a revival
[41:05] going on because you don't have within
[41:08] you
[41:10] now i'm going to ruin it two folks so
[41:12] hold on first off you don't have within
[41:14] you the holy ghost or you can be revived
[41:17] because only those with the holy ghost
[41:19] can be revived right
[41:21] the bible's not for the sinner
[41:23] or you have been taught so much
[41:26] by mankind
[41:28] until you're blinded to the truth
[41:33] of a day and the greatest revival that
[41:35] could ever be
[41:37] you mean we're going to end it all up
[41:38] but yet we're going to end it up in a
[41:40] small manner
[41:44] you mean the greatest of all things has
[41:46] come upon us
[41:49] and we're just going to sit here
[41:51] well
[41:52] i used to be able to get to church every
[41:54] service but
[41:56] i just can't do it now
[42:01] i just can't make it
[42:04] well
[42:08] that's up to you
[42:13] it has come to the basis that more
[42:15] things are important to us now
[42:18] instead of being at church
[42:20] in the word of god
[42:23] right
[42:25] if not
[42:27] what's going on
[42:31] huh
[42:34] well brother dale you're you're doing
[42:36] this doing that
[42:39] it's what i said the truth
[42:43] well why are you putting names to who
[42:44] i'm talking about
[42:46] you know what i'm talking about you
[42:49] you are the one i'm talking about
[42:51] because the others are not here
[42:55] okay
[43:00] we'll get on to that in the next message
[43:02] lord willing but listen
[43:07] all of those demons
[43:09] what is it in i've got it in the notes
[43:11] but
[43:13] for the next service
[43:15] all of those demons that was in the
[43:17] river euphrates
[43:20] everyone said it was looked on the jews
[43:23] to drive them to the homeland right
[43:26] we'll get back to it and read it
[43:29] he said that was in the 40s
[43:33] you know
[43:34] and he said
[43:35] about 20 years later
[43:37] he's loosed on the bride the driver to
[43:41] the message of the hour
[43:48] all that great army of the cankerworm
[43:50] palm worm locust caterpillar
[43:52] and you know he doesn't have any
[43:53] problems saying
[43:55] my army
[43:56] that i sent among you
[43:59] and we know he's not the author of the
[44:01] cankerworm world
[44:03] and all of that right
[44:05] but he said i permitted that i raised up
[44:09] the army
[44:11] to come against you
[44:12] you know i allowed it to raise up russia
[44:15] has been raised up blessed of god
[44:18] to annihilate the rest of us one day
[44:23] he said you mean god will do that he's
[44:24] got to have somebody to do it
[44:28] but think about it
[44:33] he said the revival that we just went
[44:35] through
[44:36] has ceased
[44:39] now if you want to make that is azusa
[44:41] street that's fine with me
[44:44] but if you want to make it
[44:46] as it
[44:47] he saw
[44:51] and am i right to what he said he said
[44:55] i see that even my ministry
[44:57] is not having the effect
[45:00] that it had
[45:03] now what about a man see the dead raised
[45:05] sick healed and a thing happened
[45:08] but at that time would say
[45:11] things was going pretty bad
[45:15] but yet turn around and say
[45:18] i'm looking for a bride to be here
[45:22] that will strip satan
[45:24] of all his
[45:26] powers he ever thought he had
[45:33] do you understand what i'm saying you
[45:34] say are you looking for a revival no
[45:37] no
[45:38] let's get that right
[45:40] i've been in a revival
[45:43] i'm experiencing a revival
[45:46] you know what brother dale i've seen you
[45:48] i've seen you beat down i've seen you
[45:51] in troubles and heartaches and problems
[45:55] what's that got to do with it
[46:01] see it's because you have it figured out
[46:05] what you think
[46:08] a revival is to be
[46:12] you've got it figured out as to what's
[46:14] to happen in this day
[46:19] but can you put it in the word
[46:24] i mean can you put it in the word
[46:26] whatever you got in other words i ask
[46:27] you to say
[46:28] you know
[46:30] all right you believe so and so brother
[46:31] mark show me in the word
[46:35] you should be
[46:37] able to do that or you shouldn't be
[46:39] believing
[46:40] something you know
[46:43] the bible said to be ready to give an
[46:44] answer of the reason of the hope
[46:46] that lies within you
[46:51] well see i believe
[46:53] that god sent us a prophet
[46:58] and the signs and the wonders was to get
[47:00] the attention
[47:03] and he had to bring a restoration back
[47:05] to the faith of the fathers
[47:09] that's why when he got there you know
[47:10] beyond the curtain of time he said i
[47:12] preached what paul preached
[47:16] see he stood there knowing that he'd
[47:18] preached the bible to the letter
[47:21] go to spoken word as the original seed
[47:23] and see if i'm right or not that's right
[47:27] and even the holy spirit vindicating it
[47:29] by showing for him to write
[47:33] and he wrote it
[47:35] and it come down to the basis but said
[47:37] as of yet
[47:40] malachi 4
[47:41] is not fulfilled
[47:44] all right
[47:46] what would you do if you seem that way
[47:51] he knew there was something to come
[47:55] remember my definition of pentecost
[47:58] it never ends
[48:02] the day we walk out of this world
[48:04] will be our day of pentecost
[48:09] the day we meet the lord in the hour
[48:11] will be our day of pentecost
[48:16] you're talking about a revival
[48:20] but why can't we see now
[48:24] but you ask people how you do well
[48:27] we're going to be well
[48:28] you know i'm having all these problems i
[48:30] don't know why everything's against me
[48:32] i believe the word
[48:41] why can't you rejoice even when you're
[48:44] at your lowest point
[48:48] i would not say this i'm going to say it
[48:49] anyway you can get upset with me if you
[48:51] want to dick addison
[48:53] look at me
[48:55] don't you ever sit over there and say
[48:58] that you're coming down with alzheimer's
[49:00] that's been on me for two ever since you
[49:02] said it don't you ever say that again in
[49:04] this church
[49:07] don't come in here talking like that
[49:10] to any of you
[49:13] because you're making your confession
[49:16] and it'll go to what you're saying
[49:19] i'm sorry if i don't go over good
[49:21] forgive me but it's burdened me for ever
[49:24] since he said it
[49:27] don't do it
[49:43] stripes i'm healed if i get better
[49:47] i thought
[49:49] the prophet said
[49:51] that
[49:53] getting worse
[49:55] was the greatest sign you were healed am
[49:58] i missing that
[50:02] when are we going to start this being
[50:03] that away
[50:06] and you'll see why i've always been that
[50:08] away right
[50:10] ain't nobody in this church can come out
[50:11] and say that that ain't been me since
[50:13] i've been pastor here
[50:17] my testimony has always been
[50:21] positive
[50:30] always positive about god's word
[50:32] always looking for god to do
[50:38] something does it matter how sick we are
[50:41] or what's going on
[50:44] so you're saying if god will heal me i
[50:46] believe that we're in revival
[50:49] if you understand what i've tried to
[50:50] bring
[50:52] you see why i cut off because i know
[50:54] good get all i wanted to say
[51:00] the prophet's message
[51:03] was the former reign
[51:06] the holy ghost quicken it
[51:08] is the latter rhine
[51:10] all right
[51:12] now you mean to tell me we have had the
[51:14] greatest message
[51:15] that the world has ever heard
[51:18] we have a message within our possession
[51:23] that the world has waited on
[51:27] that the prophet's desire to look into
[51:31] that everything that's been backed down
[51:33] is speaking of you and i
[51:40] but yet we want to just play around with
[51:42] it
[51:45] well
[51:46] i get feeling better i'll tell everybody
[51:47] i'm healed well don't worry about it you
[51:49] ain't gonna tell nobody
[51:51] go and tell the doctor
[51:54] right
[51:55] he's wanting a little money he needs a
[51:57] vacation go ahead
[52:00] you know
[52:02] ain't nothing wrong with going to
[52:03] doctors you know better
[52:05] because when we got our confidence in
[52:07] them
[52:11] right
[52:13] instead of our confidence being in god
[52:14] amen
[52:18] cause come on they're gonna tell you the
[52:19] best they can because they don't want to
[52:21] cut they don't want to lose you as their
[52:22] customer
[52:24] right
[52:25] i've never found a doctor yet wanted to
[52:26] lose customers if you
[52:28] you know
[52:29] i mean they want you to come back
[52:33] but listen
[52:35] look at what your prophet had to say
[52:40] and i want you to notice the year
[52:42] of 1956.
[52:48] when he said
[52:50] i predict
[52:52] the revival's over
[52:55] i predict that america will turn against
[52:58] the gospel
[53:01] and look what he said at that time go
[53:04] ahead and pull it up brother
[53:05] elisha the prophet in 1956 1002
[53:11] raised on
[53:15] there's not a hope left to this nation
[53:18] as i see
[53:19] only an old-fashioned revival
[53:23] and according to the scripture
[53:28] it'll never be nationwide
[53:33] you know
[53:35] maybe you don't listen to what i just
[53:37] read
[53:39] i read where he said in 60
[53:42] what was it
[53:44] 62
[53:48] 64.
[53:50] calling jesus on the scene
[53:54] that his message spearheaded a great
[53:56] sweeping revival
[54:05] that's what i don't understand about
[54:06] these
[54:10] people are the message
[54:14] i mean if you want to find a lot of
[54:15] contradictions
[54:17] call me up sometime i'll try to help you
[54:20] to dig your own hole
[54:24] because anything right around says
[54:26] you can find a quote
[54:29] almost directly against that
[54:33] but it all comes together and makes a
[54:34] beautiful picture once it's revealed
[54:40] but we don't want to wait till it's
[54:41] revealed
[54:43] look
[54:46] it'll never be nationwide so then we're
[54:48] just left it'll be a revival
[54:51] among the people
[54:54] the elect of god
[54:58] but it won't be a real sweeping revival
[55:01] take the whole nation in
[55:02] never was
[55:04] and never will be
[55:11] and he just said he predicted
[55:14] that america would turn down the gospel
[55:19] what about it church
[55:22] what are you putting your bases on
[55:29] what are you basing your
[55:31] your thoughts on remember
[55:34] this is life or death
[55:36] i mean we're going to be haphazard let's
[55:37] just go on back and join the
[55:39] denominations and just have a good time
[55:41] you know if we just kind of
[55:43] carried down just a little bit wouldn't
[55:44] be so strong on water baptism or
[55:46] something we'd be tickled they'd be
[55:48] tickled to have us because we could
[55:49] preach messages right out of the bible
[55:52] they'd never heard of
[55:54] and they would love to have us as long
[55:55] as we leave certain things out
[56:00] well if we're not going with all of it
[56:03] why not quit
[56:08] right
[56:11] why not just quit and get out of it
[56:16] but yet if you understand what i'm
[56:17] trying to bring
[56:18] he said
[56:20] it's for the elect
[56:23] now turn on a tape when you get home
[56:26] any one tape
[56:32] any word that you want to put it on
[56:36] of any year or any time of the year
[56:39] and listen to that tape
[56:42] and come back and show me
[56:44] the man was so negative until he didn't
[56:47] know what was going on
[56:49] oh we're all having problems
[56:52] we're all having troubles
[56:56] did you ever hear a man
[56:59] like brother branham
[57:01] with as positive of an attitude as the
[57:03] man had
[57:06] i'd love to be able to sit down and talk
[57:09] to the lord jesus
[57:11] you know what he was a human being
[57:14] he had troubles
[57:16] you know
[57:18] he had heart aches and problems
[57:20] but he was never negative
[57:25] he was always positive
[57:28] brother branham was always positive
[57:32] even he'll tell the story that
[57:35] god took his wife away
[57:38] and god took his child away
[57:42] he said honey
[57:44] i'll lay you on your mom's arms
[57:47] because the angel's coming to get you
[57:50] lord give us the lord taketh away
[57:54] man asked him later said brother branham
[57:56] said did you keep your religion during
[57:58] the time of the death of your wife and
[58:00] daughter he says no
[58:02] he said my religion kept me
[58:08] what about it has your religion kept you
[58:16] you see why my attitude is always
[58:17] positive
[58:22] not just when you call me and ask me how
[58:23] i'm feeling and i say wonderful when i'm
[58:26] hurting like crazy
[58:29] because they don't have anything to do
[58:30] with it
[58:33] i'm saying what god says
[58:35] remember the message the other day
[58:37] there is no negativism in christianity
[58:42] you remember that
[58:47] but you just never have been like i've
[58:49] been
[58:50] well
[58:55] according to the prophet
[58:59] if you've prayed
[59:02] and committed everything to god i'm
[59:03] paraphrasing his statement but it's
[59:05] pretty close
[59:06] and god don't come on the scene to heal
[59:08] you he said god's testing you
[59:11] he said hold on
[59:16] you remember the quote we read where
[59:18] you say we haven't had a re he said
[59:20] revival it hasn't come yet
[59:22] just hold on
[59:28] revival for the elect
[59:32] when he got in the seal book he said
[59:34] i call you
[59:37] bride
[59:41] this message was not sent to the world
[59:44] now get my point of what i'm doing
[59:47] azusa street
[59:49] the spirit was poured out upon all flesh
[59:53] the world benefited by it right
[59:55] right
[59:58] brother brown's ministry of malachi 4
[1:00:01] rising with healing in his wings the
[1:00:03] world
[1:00:05] benefited
[1:00:06] by the message that the man brought
[1:00:12] but the world won't never benefit
[1:00:15] about this message that i'm talking
[1:00:17] about
[1:00:19] this revival is only for the bride
[1:00:24] it's not for anybody else
[1:00:28] the foolish virgins yeah they can
[1:00:30] receive i know the message
[1:00:32] i know what it says third pull is for
[1:00:33] the bride to the church and
[1:00:36] uh for the bride and the foolish virgin
[1:00:39] and to the totally lost
[1:00:43] but listen church
[1:00:46] just for a minute
[1:00:49] joel said the former and the latter
[1:00:51] reign hosea said the former
[1:00:55] in the latter rain
[1:00:58] see there can't be a latter rain
[1:01:01] until you first have a former
[1:01:03] man
[1:01:04] all right
[1:01:07] see so the prophet brought the former
[1:01:09] reign
[1:01:11] he cannot be the holy ghost so he can't
[1:01:13] quicken it
[1:01:15] you remember the quote we read the
[1:01:17] pastor can't bring the revival
[1:01:20] brother branham couldn't bring the
[1:01:21] revival
[1:01:27] he could deliver to the people
[1:01:30] the word of god
[1:01:31] the revival will be among the people
[1:01:36] the revival will come among you and i
[1:01:43] listen at him in 1955
[1:01:46] during that time
[1:01:48] that you'll say the revival was over
[1:01:53] nothing's taken place
[1:01:56] we're just sitting around waiting on the
[1:01:57] bus to pull up
[1:02:01] i believe
[1:02:02] that that is the time
[1:02:04] that the church has arrived at today
[1:02:08] that the next great move
[1:02:10] in the church is for god
[1:02:13] after we've seen the false alarms
[1:02:16] but now god will place in his church
[1:02:19] correctly
[1:02:20] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:02:23] not man
[1:02:26] made seminary
[1:02:28] bolton
[1:02:29] but god will place into the church
[1:02:32] not theology
[1:02:35] runovers
[1:02:37] and overnights
[1:02:39] but god will place in the church
[1:02:42] as god has chosen as the holy ghost had
[1:02:44] tutored this church and raised it up
[1:02:47] and in thou god will adopt
[1:02:50] into into the position of his sons
[1:02:53] they're already his sons
[1:02:55] whether they are worthy of the position
[1:02:57] that he has for them
[1:03:02] you know that's still in the message
[1:03:05] look at the next one where it says a
[1:03:07] deceived church 1959
[1:03:12] god send us another church
[1:03:14] just before the end time
[1:03:17] that the power of the holy ghost can
[1:03:19] come into her
[1:03:21] in the demonstrations of the spirit
[1:03:23] and mark 16
[1:03:25] can follow the church
[1:03:27] acts 2 and 4 acts 2 and 38
[1:03:30] all of it with will be following right
[1:03:32] along with the church signing wonders
[1:03:36] accompanied the apostles
[1:03:38] great signs of his resurrection
[1:03:40] accompanying them
[1:03:42] while they were in prison surely god's
[1:03:44] growing a crop somewhere
[1:03:47] for this life's kill
[1:03:49] great kill
[1:03:50] may it be my christian friend here this
[1:03:53] morning may it be your strength
[1:03:56] has begun to grow
[1:03:58] i pray
[1:04:01] for this message
[1:04:06] samson
[1:04:07] got his eyes put out
[1:04:11] looked like lost all hopes
[1:04:15] but he cried out one more once more lord
[1:04:19] and he killed more
[1:04:22] in his own death when he pulled a
[1:04:24] building down
[1:04:25] then he killed in his life
[1:04:30] he died of victory
[1:04:36] death that's no problem
[1:04:38] if you're afraid of dying then you you
[1:04:40] need to be praying a little bit
[1:04:43] get that kind of straightened up because
[1:04:44] it's a little something shaky there
[1:04:47] you say now wait a minute you no we're
[1:04:49] human
[1:04:50] yeah
[1:04:53] but you see church
[1:04:55] somebody
[1:04:57] is going to take this message
[1:05:00] and it'll be revealed to him
[1:05:03] see
[1:05:04] it'll be made to a point that he said
[1:05:09] the fifo ministry
[1:05:12] would take this message and break it
[1:05:14] down
[1:05:16] bring it to the people
[1:05:19] but yet nobody wants to trust to fight
[1:05:20] for ministry and hey i don't mind saying
[1:05:22] it i don't trust them either
[1:05:26] okay
[1:05:28] you know what i mean by that the biggest
[1:05:30] portion or not trying to
[1:05:35] because this is not trying to pump up a
[1:05:37] revival
[1:05:41] we used to we had old
[1:05:44] bicycles and
[1:05:46] we had old tires and we had an old patch
[1:05:50] that you glued on
[1:05:52] well
[1:05:55] you know you take an old vulcanized
[1:05:57] patch and boy you could after that come
[1:05:58] out it was really great and you could
[1:06:00] just pump that thing up and the whole to
[1:06:01] be this big well you said man that'll
[1:06:03] stay
[1:06:04] don't do that when you're gluing one
[1:06:08] when you're gluing it stick it real good
[1:06:11] put the
[1:06:12] inner tube inside the tire
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:18] to where that the patch will
[1:06:21] hit the wall
[1:06:23] and hold make sure it's good straight
[1:06:26] not crooked
[1:06:28] and then pump it
[1:06:30] up you know
[1:06:32] what are you getting at brother dale
[1:06:34] i'm getting at one thing
[1:06:38] i don't think we're in the days of the
[1:06:40] pump up tires
[1:06:43] i think we're in the day that we should
[1:06:44] be realizing who we are
[1:06:48] and what's going on
[1:06:50] and how that
[1:06:52] god has reserved
[1:06:54] for his bride
[1:06:56] the greatest revival
[1:07:00] as i said while ago and emphasized it
[1:07:02] over and over that every revival only
[1:07:04] spoke of this revival
[1:07:09] all of that that's what we've talked
[1:07:10] about the great moves of god
[1:07:14] brother brandon we read this morning
[1:07:15] where he said to be a short
[1:07:17] do it
[1:07:19] but he never backed off where he said
[1:07:21] limbs would be restored
[1:07:24] he never backed off in the quote word of
[1:07:26] israel would see god coming after us and
[1:07:29] think they're coming after them
[1:07:36] former letter rain
[1:07:39] former rain is a teaching reign
[1:07:42] the latter rain is a quickening
[1:07:45] or harvest or may i say it this way
[1:07:49] a revival of the former rain
[1:07:52] was this message
[1:07:54] that went around the world
[1:07:57] in a great revival of healings and
[1:08:00] wonders
[1:08:01] because it was promised
[1:08:03] in god's word
[1:08:05] and if that would be the former reign
[1:08:08] what are we to expect
[1:08:10] in a lot of rain
[1:08:14] come on folks
[1:08:17] somebody call you up to pray for me
[1:08:19] ain't no need to parade
[1:08:23] well there ain't no need of it
[1:08:25] if that's the way you think
[1:08:27] all right
[1:08:28] now you don't need to pray
[1:08:30] you know
[1:08:31] i know one brother that fellow come with
[1:08:33] him to be praying he said i'm worse
[1:08:35] shape than you are
[1:08:38] well that's re that's really uplifting
[1:08:41] you know
[1:08:42] right
[1:08:44] i mean you call me up
[1:08:46] you say brother there will you pray for
[1:08:48] me
[1:08:48] i don't know where you've got enough
[1:08:49] energy or not i'm in a bad shape today
[1:08:52] i'll tell you why it's been rough you
[1:08:54] better call somebody else pray for you
[1:08:58] and you probably wouldn't call me very
[1:08:59] much
[1:09:00] and i will go ahead and say it when i'm
[1:09:03] at it most of you don't call me to pray
[1:09:05] for you
[1:09:06] you call other people
[1:09:10] geek your own grace
[1:09:14] you will come eventually right back to
[1:09:16] here
[1:09:20] i'm putting that out and forget it
[1:09:23] i don't have anything wrong with you
[1:09:24] calling other people to pray for you
[1:09:28] but brother dale i don't want to bother
[1:09:29] you with my troubles
[1:09:32] i thought that's what the pastor was
[1:09:35] you know
[1:09:37] you ain't never heard me
[1:09:40] say nothing like that
[1:09:42] but you see
[1:09:43] let's get our priorities straight
[1:09:48] get our lives in order we'll get on it
[1:09:49] next service
[1:09:52] where brother branham said
[1:09:54] even just one
[1:09:56] little
[1:09:57] unconfessed sin
[1:10:00] will cause a church to bitterly fail
[1:10:03] and that you'll answer for it
[1:10:06] it's a day of judgment
[1:10:09] he said what's that got to do with
[1:10:10] revival you can't have a revival till
[1:10:12] you get rid of the dead
[1:10:16] you can't revive the dead
[1:10:19] right
[1:10:20] you revive the living
[1:10:25] the dead can't do it
[1:10:30] take on these things
[1:10:31] you have problems just write down your
[1:10:33] questions and give them to me i'll be
[1:10:35] glad to cover them
[1:10:38] i want to make sure one thing that you
[1:10:39] understand me
[1:10:43] we're not looking for a worldwide
[1:10:44] sweeping revival
[1:10:46] no survey
[1:10:50] we're not looking for another azusa
[1:10:52] street
[1:10:53] revival
[1:10:55] we're not looking for another of brother
[1:10:57] branham and his ministry and that
[1:10:59] revival
[1:11:04] but you know what people will say well
[1:11:07] brother ryan said we wouldn't go to
[1:11:09] empty hospital
[1:11:10] he didn't say you could empty half of it
[1:11:15] you go in the hospital you know well i'm
[1:11:17] going in there to pray for some brother
[1:11:19] and all that
[1:11:21] brother branham said
[1:11:22] that there's no such thing as empty nose
[1:11:24] i'm not going in to empty the hospital
[1:11:27] i'm going to pray for one person
[1:11:31] but see i can get all of that unbelief
[1:11:34] you know what might as well stay at home
[1:11:36] that's the truth
[1:11:38] all right
[1:11:41] see positive about it
[1:11:45] be positive
[1:11:49] we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:11:53] he saved the best of life
[1:11:57] i didn't make the story book
[1:11:59] i'm just glad to be on the live page
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:05] you know what if he brought paul up here
[1:12:07] paul couldn't stand it
[1:12:08] we'll have to i'll talk to him when i
[1:12:10] get there one of these days he'll know
[1:12:11] what i'm saying right
[1:12:14] those people couldn't take it
[1:12:17] you see them it died of the lines and
[1:12:18] the different things yeah
[1:12:22] because you didn't listen well ago when
[1:12:23] i said this is the worst age
[1:12:26] if any age has been capable of signs
[1:12:29] showing that a revival is present it's
[1:12:31] this age
[1:12:33] when insanity is on every hand
[1:12:35] the enemy has come in from every side
[1:12:43] but the spirit of the lord
[1:12:45] will raise up a standard
[1:12:48] do we believe that
[1:12:51] who are we bragging on
[1:12:52] come on musicians
[1:12:56] take on these things
[1:12:58] what do you think about a revival
[1:13:01] well i still believe there ain't no
[1:13:05] revival going home
[1:13:08] when i tell me what you believe it about
[1:13:11] and we'll see what we can do about it
[1:13:14] all right
[1:13:15] with golly
[1:13:23] okay
[1:13:26] paragraph 45.

[1:26:06] and it was
[1:26:07] like some
[1:26:09] vikings or something
[1:26:11] brother brown said when they went
[1:26:12] i can look it up and show you but so
[1:26:15] then when they went to a country
[1:26:17] he said the first thing they done was
[1:26:19] burn their boats
[1:26:22] he said because they wouldn't going back
[1:26:27] he said that's what they're doing said
[1:26:29] when they reached land they burned their
[1:26:30] boats
[1:26:32] he said because he wasn't going back
[1:26:34] he said that's the way we ought to be
[1:26:38] go forward with no place to go backward
[1:26:41] because if you ain't got a boat to carry
[1:26:43] back across
