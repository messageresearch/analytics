the week he meant we just remember the announcements you know that they made member brother Richard and and Aaron's dad he's in real bad shape during the hospitals will remember that and also remember brother Addison said that they either done give it to him or either they're gonna have to give him two more units of blood yeah they did today okay they say he's probably it all together now lost 20 units over time and they can't they don't know where it's going you know what's taking it away or what's causing the problems so you know we can pray for healing and all but let's pray for them to find out what it's all about I remember we were praying years ago for my brother and he was having a lot of troubles and you know we just asked the Lord to take care of it and to do whatever we'll you know what they just sit him down to Atlanta one day and I was checking him out well the first doctor that walked in and he just looked at him he said I know what's wrong with you you know he was right

father we ask you to bless each and every one be with brother dick gar Lord remember the others that are sick among us by the I'll just and brother Colley cover all of these Lord through the blood and just have your way with us and guide us now and keep us in Jesus name Amen 1st Peter 1 we've been reading this for a while trying to get out to some interesting points anyway so Simon Peter is serving an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ now written to whom this is not written to the world this is written to Christians alright now I'll say this over again in a minute the stature of a perfect man is not controlling about the new birth as much as it's talking about the growth development in your Christianity it's not just dealing with the the birth the birth Peter covers over the chapter before sin you know talking about how that you're being warned again alright see then it comes into this situation so look at it like that now think about it those this is written into the church to tell her how to become to where he was at all right this is Grace and peace be unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust see that's not a that's a born-again Christian if you're talking to you know in trying to get them to move on then and besides this then it right besides this that's what besides being of like precious faith besides being of them that are of talking about the divine nature and that have have you know gotten rid of the corruption that is in the world through lust in other words our born-again Christian right all right and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue of knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you may you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord that is blessing for the reading of the words well now follow the point of what I just said and it will help us see Peter is speaking to born-again Christians them of like precious faith all right now I know that there's a doctrine in the message that's teaching that you don't have the new birth until you get all the virtues well I don't agree with that I mean I'm serious I don't think the Prophet did that's why I spent months after month after month reading what he said to you and to you that how the notes don't you know there's about five or six pages tonight and just don't throw them away because we will probably need them again Sunday cuz I'm sure I won't get through all right it's just it's something to try to get people to see what the Bible is doing the Bible's not written to a sinner the only thing a sinner can do has become knowledgeable of being a sinner it's not written to him because he is in the world of corruption and he's in he's not in you know the position to be able to do he can only hear you need to be saved so you say well two people now know watch this we'll get to it now see people to say well before ever become a Christian I studied the Bible I read the Bible I could memorize the Bible well praise God praise God but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe right have you got born again since you met and all we went through all it well I've got it all well that's where the Prophet when you get down to it it reading it see he said it's not that kind of knowledge he said it's the knowledge of whether in other words acts 2:38 contrary to Matthew 28:19 or not that's the kind of knowledge we need and knowing that it's not contrary that it is the word let's see that's the kind that we need to do now we'll try to get into the definition of these things as we're going through it but now think about what we've covered the Prophet said how faith and be born again he said the that is your foundation and the whole foundation of Christianity is except on faith in the Word of God all right and see if we can't believe to God to be able to keep his word straight what kind of a God do you have if you can't believe that he can keep it straight without it being contradictory what kind of a guarded are really what kind of a guard you trying to be see are you trying to show how smart you are that you found this you found contradictions and you found these things you know you see just showing how smart you are what are you trying to do be smarter than God then that's your choice I'm just trying to make the point or illustrate it because that's where that's what I've always believed I believe you're born again by faith believing God accepting him as your Savior than him coming back and accepting you and giving you the back - some of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth and the Prophet says then you're born again at faith said then these things these virtues are the things God expects us to add now you said well we can't add nothing well I'm not talking like that I'm trying to get you to see what he's talking about he's not talking about that we've got to have virtuous or with us have it we got to have natural witness will will read will read will read we'll just read ourselves into salvation no you can read it all you want to memorize all you want to it's still no good unless it's made alive unless that word is quickened and made alive it is worth nothing to us except dead letters on a page and what if the Bible say the letter killeth but the Spirit give us life all right and see then as I've always tried to get you to see then to me the you reading the message you hear in the prophet see Peter is trying to tell us how to come to where he is because he's writing about it and he said and the Prophet verified it by saying this is written to Christians those that are born again but then we need a growth development you know we need to keep eating that's like a baby being born it's more that's good but then it needs to eat and that's the way the Christian must do is eat the Word of God until we become the Word of God now what did we try to deal with our basically Sunday of talking about how do you get these virtues if we need them how do we get them well Kalidas I've got where the Prophet said that it's automatically given what do you think about it when he says you've got to grow in grace and knowledge then the Bible says you got to do these things the Bible doesn't say everything just automatically added it will be automatically added if we yield ourselves if we don't yield ourselves to God we will have no growth development that's should be sensible enough for all of us to understand so what do we do make ourself available by studying the Word of God right and as we study the Word of God then God can take that as us trying to say Sunday that we'd say what I need virtue and we have it here you know as I'm eating the word I can't just pick out scriptures and say oh there's one on virtua that's done non-virtual well I got it now I got I got thirty something on virtues know it's eating the word and it's not to say that's what I've emphasized over and over you say well brother Dale you you teach us that the new birth is a revelation what I need a revelation hug that's not for you to try to figure out that's for us to be able to study and let God reveal it to us right it's always been so amazing to me I've tried to explain that you know all the 40 something years that have tried to how that you could be sitting somewhere listening to God you know speaking through some brother in these ministering and and your soul you get locked in with him and doing pretty good with all that once your mind floats off on something else well now floating off might be bad cuz you might be asleep so we tell my dad now well we're talking about that the Holy Spirit can come in and just open up another channel or something over here because that's why I love what the Prophet said do you say brother Dale do you know what you I know what my gift is I know what it is I I know whatever ministers gift is the Prophet talked to you he said it was to break the spell this Satan has over your eyes well I got no spell over mine I believe everything the Prophet said all right that's for you and your problems not mine but just remember now what I'm saying I believe the statue of a perfect man is exactly what it's saying statue means hot growth or development all right and in doing that then it brings us to the divine nature of Almighty God and that wonderful see we didn't know these things back down through time until the Prophet came on the scene it was in the Bible but we didn't we didn't realize what it was speaking or who it was speaking about you realize that's speaking exactly to me and you that's our day that we're right in the world this if I whether I ever attain unto it or anything whatsoever it's there for this age because there's not another age there's not another time so we're in that time of it did not make you happy to realize that God is speaking to us and opening to us the word and as we knew didn't what did the Prophet say he said the Holy Ghost is sitting in your soul waiting on you to bring him the word well how does that do faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word right all right and you bring the word to him and said he'll make it alive as quick as you bring it in well in that wonderful we'll see that's the part we have to do with it so as we were trying to cover that a tad this read that so you'll read the Prophet one time we'll say you add huh then in a minute he'll say God adds Christmas get it straight I mean what is it as we study the word he reveals the word right and that makes it a part of us okay see it's it's when it's when the word is revealed then there's nothing can take it away because that's what the church is built on the revelation of Jesus Christ so it's not trying to find secret coded mysteries it's just to believe what God's saying right now as we go through these definitions now watch remember you're going to have to listen to the Prophet because our definitions on words might be a little different we'll get to it in a minute where he's talking about virtue he said now that is not to be a just to be a virgin life but yet Webster says that's the definition Webster says that's the definition of virtue it's to be a virgin man woman or a girl you know I'm using that cause prophet used both word all right see then he said not in this case then when we get to temperance it's really gonna jump out bless god I ain't got no temper I got your baptism with the Holy Ghost you can't have the baptism the Holy Ghost and have a temper you are wrong and you won't admit it right your prophet said it he said it's not temperance according to Webster is to stop drinking alcohol you know moonshine liquor the wrong definition for Christianity what you see he said it's that uncontrollable temper oh I got no temper I go well why is your face getting red why are you blushing you've tried to convince me of that or yourself prophet said do we sin he said everyday well a Christian Kate's in now we've got a good definition out of that we got it going round but that's the point I want you to think of now because listen the word Virts you I gave you the definition over the other day it means a moral excellency it means goodness it means righteousness now I like this one because it will come over to what the Prophet gave the definition of virtue being strength what's this one inherit inherit power to produce effect inherit power to produce a fact now you'll see what it means when we come over to it in a minute where the Prophet says virtue is strength it means chaste ISTE every how you pronounce it especially in a girl or a woman it's got that definition but when the Prophet is using it the word it doesn't apply in the statue of a perfect man as to the chastity part of doing like that because it should not now listen that's why I emphasized over and over and over see look look at the point you said Webster said is chastity yeah now that's not the word but chase to see shouldn't have anything to do with it when you're standing here as a born-again Christian right now are we getting straight chase to see should not apply to a born-again Christian raaah we're supposed to be a virgin to God's Word me and women and all let's see then we'll see that some of the words sometimes fall into a wrong English translation of his humanity and giving us the wrong definition let's see the Providence say not in this case like I said this should be no problem people say well I'll tell you what boy I've been born again 40 years but you know about 30 years ago I heard the prophets message not stop drinking that don't fit because I didn't drink to start with and I hung with the guys that did do the drinking I'd haul them in my car back in the old days if they caught you with an in car and you know they get you and I I Drive them over and get the beer and come back and in hypersleep it didn't bother me because I didn't want to drink I didn't have to quit drinking when it came into message I didn't have to quit lying cheating stealing when I come in the message I found a stronger boy you is somewhere you missed the Christianity point down through time okay I get on that I get rough don't know all right now look see Peter then is trying to tell us how to become virtuous Christians virtuous Christians you know having his nature virtuous having the nature of Almighty God dwelling within us by the new birth see then that means you got to have faith is a foundation because that's the only thing that's worth anything all right and think about it if you're born again now perforated I've got these the notes you can have them they catch up they can do alright brother Branham says if you're Christian you don't have to worry about the feathers right you don't have to worry about the feathers if you're Christian now if you're not a Christian what are you going to you'll have problems you're gonna be liked a lot the the crow with the peacock feathers or ever what you call it all right you're gonna be claiming something that you ain't but when you're a Christian see you don't have to worry about the things of God they're expected of us but of course when gently works out it turned out the other way because you know what my mom used to tell us he said you know said a woman can go out here and commit adultery and since he has to wear an a around the RET her neck the rest of her days was that the old man go out and commit adultery all he wanted to and said he's a brother right he's good brother that don't fit to me on the inside okay see I'm trying to tell you you don't listen to what say it I didn't drink I didn't do I didn't smoke I didn't do them things I smoked just a little bit when I was a kid and throwed it away I didn't have no desire for that didn't make me a Christian that was just appointed I didn't have any desire for those things I'm not saying that God kept me from drinking and doing no sign maybe he did to where I could talk about it but I didn't know anything about it yeah but listen he says don't worry about the feathers they will be automatically added now remember what I said there's a difference in that in adding automatically and automatically added automatically adding see God will add to you if will yield ourselves let's see what our problem is we try to go at it in we we like I said we take the point of sin would you know it faith is a new birth well what I need to study what what do I need to do what I need to get a revelation of about to birth the main thing is revelation you in bad shape at that point that's about as good as anything or messed up so you don't have to try to figure it out when they heard on the day of Pentecost the story of Jesus Christ through Peter in 2nd there in acts 2 the things where he's explaining the things that he explains about Christ's coming down and all of the things and brought it right down to it and they said they've become pricked in their heart well read add Peter never said stop drinking stop chewing stop smoking now come on can I quote the Prophet the Prophet said people ask what to do to be saved he said we tell them what they ought not to do he said we don't tell them what they really need to do it's just how faith is be born again just accept Jesus Christ as our Savior that's how simple the new birth is don't try to find a revelation don't worry about it you'll find that why because the Prophet said it would be automatically now listen to my definition and thoughts because I try to express what I believe see until this prophet came and brought us the message of the stature of a perfect man we had no way whatsoever to attain unto any of these things oh we could get a little bit of it a little bit of that we were all but then why did the Prophet say on blasphemous names which is related right straight to statue of perfect man he said a lot of people that's in the statute permit have a portion of these virtues without him being born again you think about you know good neighbors that would just do anything in the world help you do anything give you anything they don't make them a Christian right but you see once you once you receive the new birth now follow what I'm saying because listen to the point now see I emphasize the point that there was no way for us to get it until the Prophet come to tell us because you don't know it we didn't know that we needed these things we didn't know we could read but we didn't know that these were a requirement to be added to the Christian life we thought it was the Christian life and that's the same thing of the people in New Mexico that's the doctrine of it that they think that these virtues and things will eventually bring you to a new birth you can't even start till you born again right see then once you're born again if will yield ourselves we have the message now that's where I love things like this view people wants a little secret thing these is one of my liver secrets I go to the future home and listen to that prophet is he bringing it down and as he brings it down to us no excuse with rapture rapture as he brings it down to us he tells us what this is what that is what did it and he says what that these are the things he has come to tell us I mean did we read the Bible and know anything about the future home are the rapture but then after a while when he comes through the rapture message he lays out a real big nugget and he tells you that there it is it has been spoken he said now let it come to pass you know what I don't believe it it have been a rapture I don't believe there would ever have been a rapture or ever would be a rapture and it not been depended upon the prophets message that's the only way I can find for any of us to get out of here let's do that prophets message look it has been spoken he comes down to getting to those personal point like in the seals when he says I'm not looking for his coming he was looking right at it he could see it come on church then what does he say he says these are the things that he expects you to add when am I gonna get it by studying the prophets message by listening to tapes praying and searching for God to bring it unto us it'll bring these things to us but you see we're still trying to figure it out like I said we've go this away and we go that away when we get to temperance we'll go this way and go that away because see one side will say well I ain't got no temper I think that no plaint no temper in me it's all gone when I got the new birth then the other side says well I have problems or I'll throw booze on how I'm still having problems with it I can't get all this straight now and we're missing in the middle of the road to realize that we are human mortals and that within us there's no ability to try to serve God it's not in us as human mortals oh yeah we have a longing or desired time but yet we let that override but he said these are the things he expects you to add now how are you gonna add you get new birth okay we get faith how are you going to add virtue you can't add it until he brings the message the everything was waiting on this day that prophet said 33 years preaching this message the statue of a perfect man go back in 1950 right along in there and listen to him talking about Christians that are genuine Christians and coming down through there but yet he couldn't tied all together then one day he comes forward and he said on the message I was study you know he said these things came to me this drawing this pyramid see then he saw something well can't we see it yeah but see the thing of it is how do we get the virtues by making ourselves available to the Word of God for the hour that we're living and you ever noticed oh brother honey and well I tell you what old Benny Hinn he's doing man he's gonna say no incident but all them great guys what well I'll tell you what I love and hearing them they just preach real good where's one of them got a message now I quote brother branham and let's get it right Billy Graham he said nobody could preach salvation like Billy Graham now that's his word you want it but you don't want Billy Graham he didn't have a message he had the message of salvation to try to get you to Christ he didn't have the message to take us to a change none of them did Schuler's all of them don't matter what they didn't have a message but now listen I'm making ourselves available now what does he say I'm quoting this coming down he said don't try to add it to your actually borned again don't kind of add it until you're born again see lay your foundation and then with that foundation of incorrectly then you can have virtue to come upon that and we'll get up to the point of where we're at now virtue I hope you understand what I've drove that hollered at screamed at and everything else to get us to see that the prophet of God come to bring the word why should we worry about what everybody else is saying about it that's where it doesn't bother me what any of these brothers are doing now I said it 40 years ago I said they'll come a time when the people will be leaving the message it's own record here I said there'll be a time come when it'll be so deceiving my emphasis was I said back car in our days in the early late 60s early 70s you had people that was arguing with those that was trying to bring out those doctrines and they'd say forget it we don't care we believe the Word of God that he's brought right and what do we do yeah there was people that would argue against it I made the statement then in my point of interest emphasis was this I said they're using the quotes and things against us now but I said one day they'll come and use it into our word against us well you see it now they're saying he's wrong that's saying the Prophet was wrong and I saw that 40 years ago I saw this and said it I said the biggest portion of people in this message born-again Christians will die and go by the graves before the rapture comes that's on record for 40 to 50 years well because I saw exactly what I see today people don't want to hear what the Prophet said they won't some other way or some thought or something to bypass or what to do what can I do brother Dale like one brother told me one time he walked right up to me and he said okay now you told me that said now you tell me what to do well that's what he told me he said you you're saying that we need to be told what to do now tell me what to do when you see what I had enough him to me was to try to turn around and walk away because he was being sarcastic he was telling me you tell me what to do I can't tell nobody what to do I can tell you what we need to do we need to get born again right now look don't worry about these things just get born again and then the virtues will be added now as I said we take a virtue and there's about not offend forgot how many times virtues mentioned in the Bible with the Prophet is talking about virtue as being strength strength he said he said strength to give virture to the you know out to the people a pice now what a contacted the little woman that touched the hem of His garment come on what contacted her you know I mean you just go along with hey I thank all the school touch everybody and somebody will have it now what something directed her to a reasoning factor of human beings that if she touched him not Peter not Paul James Ernie no poet nerves he not not none of them but if she touched him she'd be healed see something quickened within her just like the man told him I'm a man of authority you don't have to go pray for my son say just beat the world see something had created an atmosphere what was that and you'll understand why the Prophet would use the word strength over the fact of using virginity and he said now it means in this case not to be a virgin but it means in this case power our strength well I always kind of thought I didn't maybe I missed a little of prophet but um I didn't think he was 9 foot tall and could cure the world I thought he was a little man I don't know what size well until like the Lord Jesus Christ was it his my in strength that brought her attention to the fact that if she could just touch him or was it the other definition that we used while ago of moral excellency and things she had heard about the dead being raised the sick being healed she had heard those things right and she says if I could just touch the hem of His garment maybe she heard about somebody else did he told to do this her had it done to that or some healing factor that had took place and she was just saying if I could just reach that heal heal me now listen to the point now it wasn't as much her virginity it was the point of her virtuous life in the basis of watching and seeing what he was and she said if I could just touch him said there's something about that man that man has been out here and I've seen the sick heal the dead raised when Ron said in that message what he said you had to have the virtue in there and he said an a pice for it to go from you to others right what's he sayin he said it's not very much of a virtue virtue being virtuous to the point that said you see them out here being a Christian one day and the next day out living like the devil ain't no sport no virtue in that I don't care how strong they are and how much they can quote how much they can holler I like things like who was it one of the Union you know and they come to him and he said back in that ages and they said the people say he said how could God do this to you said you've got to you you can't even talk you can't pretty he said it's all Jesus he said that's who I'm wanting to see right Jesus but leaving a clean moral virtuous life will bring people to the point of wanting to be like that now is that the definition of where he brought it he said now the the greatest song I ever heard was to be like Jesus when you get on over to brotherly kindness and and godliness but what's he saying in virtue its strength but where was the power was the power in her or in him what was in her wouldn't heal her she wasn't talking about that neither is the prophet talking about it in that form right he put something made her think about it something made her consider that these things have happened and I said about the the soldiers are saying you don't have to come to just speak the word what did Jesus say didn't find those no kind of faith in Israel like that the man had heard but listen why can't we hear and do something about it Nicodemus said he heard he had heard right Nicodemus said we believe that you were a man from God because no man can do these things unless God be with him he it pulls something out and then when the woman touched him it pulled the verse through out of pit out of Jesus he's the one who got weak she didn't get weak she got her healing well he got weak when it done see if he had a pice to let it out his life that he was living what did the Prophet say live me a sermon don't preach me one now if you'll notice I think this is the one that he says it in I'm pretty sure he says that let's most of us out when he's talking about having virtue he said that let's most of us out and I agree it lets most of us out we still got human problems but are you thinking with me what come back sheep everyone said faith alone won't do it faith alone won't take you to the statue of a perfect land and listen I'm saying it the best way I can if we don't get these virtues we are all going to die and go by the grave somebody has got to come to the place that these virtues will be made manifest through them and they won't have to die and we've had 50 years see the life that he was living before the people is what brought to them an understanding that there was a power there present in that man that if they could touch that power it would heal them do you remember how I told you many times take one more when they come to me and tried to tell me about I needed to be saved I wouldn't be in sarcastic I was telling the truth I said I live a better life than your Deacon board lives and you're telling me about Christianity they never argued one word because they knew I could produce the goods all right but listen I like it like this now I'm quoting it I was telling unbelief who was it yesterday maybe it wasn't any yeah huh brother branham said one day or I'll say it for myself I'm glad God got a hold of me before the church got me I'm glad God got a hold of me before the church kind of hold up cause at least I could have an opportunity why do you think I preach Church I don't have to preach to go to heaven I preached it my family will have an opportunity I preach that this church will have an opportunity to be able to walk in the light of the hour that we live in that's why I preach you think it's so joy you think it's so a great thing yeah but now listen hey virtue knowledge huh you add knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge cause that's foolishness to God now there's a definition we said knowledge what I'll just study the Bible I'll just study the message I'll just read all the time we'll praise God you have a head full now you need the Holy Ghost to quicken intamin see that's why to me it didn't matter to me to be two years coming in this mess before it ever confessed that I had to baptism with the Holy Ghost what I sure wasn't goofing off and lazing around during that time I was reading and praying and studying and trying to to serve God but listen it's not worldly knowledge now you know what he's saying see it's not just to study the word it's not to just the fact that you read the Bible it's whether or not that that you read has been revealed to you right how do you judge he said in other words that knowledge to judge said how do you judge if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and your faith now listen to him you judge whether the word is right or wrong I look I think at it like this God is pleased for his children to know his word I believe that I believe it I believe he wants his children to know the letter of the word if nothing else you know I believe that because in doing that it'll give an opportunity to flow from head knowledge or intellectualism or whatever and goes into holy ghost' knowledge but Ron says the whole word is wrote in mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it the whole Bible is written in mysteries only the Holy Ghost can reveal that knowledge what about it that is Burchard knowledge come on these are the things that he expects you to add just keep adding now you're going right down the line just keep adding how do you add it now that's what I was trying to say a minute ago how do you add it by studying it and believing it and believing it to be God's Word he can quicken it unto us or make it allow now it's added because remember what we were talking about if you're born again by faith you remember that message after message you're born again by faith all right virtue is has to be the son material knowledge has to be the same material temperance has to be the same material same material as faith well called faith is the revealed Word of God just keep adding he says now you're going right when you see when you get things that seem to contradict themselves in the Bible you sit down and study it and prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the Holy Spirit begins to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you got it that's knowledge he said let's see we're in the opposite realm of things like I've always told you if you want to see it I'll be glad most of you know all of my books were marked up anyway but if you want to see my book under statute on the daniel 70 weeks there was a lot of questions I don't understand this I'd read it I knew had knowledge what he would say it I said don't understand it I put a question I'd go back that's a book aside read other things go around and pray and know and then maybe a year later too later I'd pick that book up again and I'd read it and I'd take a marker and I'd mark that question mark out now I would not preach it until ever question mark was taken off of those pages I'm not joking young God's honest truth when they were all taken off I felt right that I could speak on it and it stood for almost fifty years I've been tore apart by any of them so I just believe it you know what because I believe that's what he said knowledge not worldly knowledge but it's heavenly knowledge and heavenly knowledge when God is the fountain of all knowledge and God is the word heavenly knowledge you believe the word and you reason anything by the word oh wait a minute now we got a statement there they've got some well we need some understanding and you reason it by the word yeah but my will said don't reason that's where the trouble that we got into this we you know we regard all that stuff but trying to read that that's what Eve done she tried to reason it out well you know the same Bible that tells us not a reason just come and let us reason together now what you're gonna do you're gonna throw which one away no see to try to reason something out by human intelligence is wrong but to wait on God to speak now quote your prophet how long did he say it was and he wouldn't preach on the hill he said he didn't preach it until he's seen it you know come on watch the problem why can't we do okay so that knowledge is to know whether the Bible is contradictory these in holy ghost knowledge heaven-born knowledge will always fit together now let's see if you follow what I'm saying in the statute of perfect man the Prophet said you had faith yeah I mean you add to your faith you don't add faith because it's a birth you add to your faith virtue or knowledge he said now these are all tempered together are glued together stuck together two or three different wordings all right which he said it was the same material well now that can't be different from anywhere else in the word he didn't had knowledge at least it can't be different if it's different it won't work if one God won't match up with Daniel seventy weeks or seventy weeks with one God then and see we don't read what the Prophet said we take what we want he says in the Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't understand this Daniel Sedin you can't understand the seals of thoughts of pleasure that's his wording you said well well I don't understand what that means you don't understand the seals the plagues of our thunders come on be sensible I mean I know all about sealed I just don't understand it's kind of like it's brother done where we used to go to church he said something about he said now that that that statue of a perfect man that's deep that's deep but he said now that adoption it's simple well it's the same time they're both the same time they're both saying the same time we'll see that was his understanding huh what about it what'd you see let's see if our now what's my point now I'm pulling into something I'll probably have to quit on this but pull to a point to get you to think it's not head knowledge it's holy ghost revealed word right that's the knowledge we're talking about the Holy Ghost revealed word now if the word tells us we've got things how can we argue against it and tell him he's wrong now the difference doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no tempers doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible temperance Holy Ghost temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh and the Lord's are drinking the things huh but we're talking about Holy Spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not to be a toddler and a lot of time on that then how to control your temper and fly off every time anybody speaks close to you yeah but brother Dale the Christians not supposed to have any temper well I only ask you one question Peter said we've got to have temperance okay so you know what that means we have problem okay now not admitting it we're we're we where are we at by not admitting it no okay temperance how to control your temper and I go to blasphemous names and look at talent isn't it study that message with this he emphasizes it heavier about that uncontrollable temper you say you have a brother day huh what you're doing you telling us it's okay to have a temper no no no no I'm telling you we got one I'm not telling us God is going to allow us to have it or no he's wanting to do away with it don't go the wrong way with me and don't justify you for a prophet to say that we sin daily well see that that's what people do it right say what about you well the Prophet said it but what do you mean I mean the Prophet says that we have a temper what it's okay for me to have a temper he didn't say that now he's just telling us the straight truth right it's great truth as human mortals we have problems that's what we're supposed to be working on right it's not saying it's okay for you to have it no no I'm gonna say it this way that temperate should have been taken care of in the new birth right well yeah there's something wrong because now your profit is one that's giving you the definition not me that he's talking about temperates being that problem with controlling the temper the other Darrell Christian shouldn't have until I agree we shouldn't have but do we well I don't have no temper I ain't had a temper since I got born again let me cross you just a little bit with a word and let's see where you go you think I'm rough it's not rough let's just sit down and talk about some of the Bible just like we're talking about this that your prophet emphatic Allah will tell you that you're not supposed to have a temper but he'll turn right back around and say we as human mortals have a temperature troubles we have problems we have heartaches you know why because we don't have these virtues is that sensible right now if we come together into the point that we can get to Holy Ghost temperance then those things will move out of the way but until then we're going to have problems I don't like that but I thought you get get saved it took care of everything where'd you get that out where did you get that from that just never even told it that what they taught once saved always saved I still had had you sinning but listen Church I'm just I'm trying to get you to think about some time that we think these things a prophet is talking about means this away when he's bringing it to mean this way and it's coming right down and cutting the legs off of every one of us I don't care who you are who's what the Bible will two pieces right but now when I look down at you and I see you do something and then I start screaming and hollering about that I thought their subscription er said something to the degree of having my own front door swept out real good right there's something to that right when I get my life right then I can say some about somebody else you see one brother Dale don't preach on things these other preachers fries they get higher clothes and readiness that's wonderful it's part of the Word of God should be tall it's dire but that's not what's gonna make us in the rapture the denominations talk that the Pentecostals taught there something you tell me about the old days of Pentecost when they wouldn't even work that time the women's clothes had to be down to certainly instance on you start telling me just remember I'm 79 years old I can remember some of those old days I can remember some good old days to always tell you about in the Baptist Church there where we was going that that right behind the church was a cemetery dark is pizza night I mean black night women would go down one side of that cemetery and there men will go down the other side of that cemetery and they get after and cry and scream out and pray to God for salvation for their family sometimes don't talk to me about the goody-goody or is that no don't tell me how goody-goody you are cuz I ain't no goody-goody and you ain't either we're all in the same boat right you know brother Dale I've never done this not never done that praise God that don't make you a Christian that's supposed to be the after-effects of the Christian life within your soul all right come on let's go by walk right over here Sunday and let's listen to this man over here preach about God and Jesus and we need to be saved and we need to get rid of this and we need to get rid of that and we need to bring in all their we need to do everything we can to save the people come on but you see one reason that I don't preach what a lot of other preach I don't walk where they walk and that's not good for me I don't try to be something that I'm not I'm just what I am I don't try to make you think that I'm a great Christian I'm just like you and me we're all the same that's what caught me with that prophet that a man like that that was so close to God until a whisper from God was all he needed her or whatever it was and it's that close but yet he turned around and tell about true Christianity is Christ living in you it's not you living in and said we've seen every day well see what about it do have any temper not because if you caught what I was doing see if you'll take heavenly knowledge now I wish I could get this in line that I did years ago in 1970 and I preached on it 71 I have two brother mol preached on returned 70 I was riding up through the mountain going over to brother being Howard how do you know where it's had it Louie I mean I Blue Ridge here what did it Dawsonville going through the mountain by myself thinking about these things I wish I could get back what was speaking to me about how that you've got to have this one for you can have that one all right now just put in plain language see you can't have virtue do you have faith first all right you can't have knowledge do you have faith and virtue yeah but I'll study the message breast Cara I'll tell you what I've got a I've got a great great thing here I'm Way up here I'm in brotherly kindness I really love my brothers and like I might not having other things well how'd you get up simple question right how'd you get up there that's as simple as I'm making it first is faith that's your foundation virtue is strength supplied by your faith knowledge will not add to brotherly kindness it will add to virtue that is mounted upon your faith faith virtue knowledge the temperance what is it black Fenian I know brother Brandon brings it through and he gets over to brotherly kindness and I'm pretty sure this way we'll get back to it but he said see being perfect godliness that's right just to that he says well we can't be perfect he said oh yes we can that is required to be perfect but he says now what is it said he has to make away see these things you say well they're just automatically now get the point of automatically you take faith and add knowledge well it's just automatic you get the point you've got to have faith virtue knowledge and each one is seeming into the other one are sealed in as your prophet used to definition then it will come to a final sealing of the whole thing but each age is sealed in faith virtue knowledge temperance patience patience can only be cemented or laid upon your temperance and temperance can only be laid upon your virtue knowledge you know they don't knew each one has got to be added to the other as you climb upward faith virtue knowledge temperance patience we can't weaken how places better unsaid and blasphemous no he said you come all the way and he said unit required to how the Holy Ghost yet there's where those people talk that message and they're still teaching it since these are the Prophet says you ain't got the Holy Ghost you get up here to brotherly kindness or something that ain't what he saying he's talking about perfection he said you come all this way before God requires for you to be perfect I love that you know what cause if he required for me to be perfect and I'm gonna say it whether you like it or not if he requires me and you to be perfect then it's got to come faith virtue knowledge temperance patience that's the only way it can come right come on what is patience brother Brennan are you talking about patience he said first one is to have patience with God now there's where we all fail that's where I fail that because I asked him and I ain't mean in the worldly things or something but when I asked him for something then you don't give it to me it tries my patience they don't you know I just score it tries mine until he makes a little more secure and then when it gets a little more secure and he starts talking to me then it'll start to where I can start thinking about the real truth have patience with one another but around said 33 years now we'll say this so that's what I said you think what you want to about what I saved it you can't argue about it cut 40 years ago I said this that the Lord spoke to me one day I believe it was him and said if you wanted patience since you gotta have patience for the people well I tried I failed but I've tried okay I'll try to have patience wanting to see you desire the word to have a joy in the Word of God to rejoice in God's Word that's what I'm saying that's what I want you to do I want you to have it to a point that you can out patience because that's what I need is patience but remember the patience has got to come towards the position it comes on each one is C minute on top of the other you can't just slide it in and and do what you won't do with it it has to be brought one after the other as the Prophet said are automatically added okay what about God trying your patience God tries them I love the statement let's see what is it where he says it this bride will prove that she will not fall like I fell right she'll prove it he's gonna make her prove it I know I've tried to explain this and a lot of people wonder but I've always tried to explain it in this away that you take back there in the Old Testament there's two prophets - prophet two scriptures one says if a prophet gives you a sign and it come to pass you better believe it another one says if the prophet gives you a sign and it comes to Pais and he takes you to another guard you better not believe it you got two things well I believe the Prophet well which one of the prophets you're going to believe now the Bible says you said would God allow prophets to come among us and be false in time the Bible says that he does that to try FA our patience he puts trouble right in front of us to see what we'll do right the Bible said even if that prophet gives you a sign and it comes to Pais don't hear him watch it because I am trying you none of us wants trouble we don't ask for trouble don't worry about it now we're about asking for trouble you're just stupid to think you can do anything with it go don't ask for trouble that's coming automatic that's one thing I do believe in they come in automatically trouble everybody else's taxes and what is it in death and taxes ain't worried about neither one of them look this you mean God would send a prophet and have the sign and it come to pies now let's illustrate somebody comes in here to preach and he said brother Dale said you left me to be open us your this Sunday you just be open and and do whatever you know you get up here and he'd say now I'm gonna pray in a little bit and said of gods they're gonna roll for caskets right in here there's gonna be a dead person in each one huh I said I'm gonna get up and say one thing y'all gonna be raised in the day it now what you gonna do cause the scripture says if it comes to pies to believe them right and we're still in the Bible that if it comes to pies I'd float to believe it you know the Urim Dunham if the life flashes in the thing you're supposed to believe it but what are you gonna do you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna ask you to say well brother what do you preach say well I tell you what I'm a little country I guess do y'all hear because I don't believe rotor Branham was a prophet because I am the roll the caskets out let the dead walk we ain't got nothing to do with it get out of here you mean you'd be that way yeah cause these off the word the God is going to try and is trying the people in this message and you see them now falling this all across the land its ministers and things that's been in the message 20 30 40 50 years and you see them just falling away right no signs and wonders you don't hear nothing you don't hear that a man went off up yonder and they had signs and wonders and and and they were 15 people healed and they're you know you're nothing like that you did hear people go off the Bible said if he take you to another God don't hear him now what's another God brother branham wouldn't a prophet in this life dead brother so enjoy that's another God you just got another garden running with it you understand and God is going to permit that to happen well you're making guard to be some kind of no I'm making what the Bible says he is like anyhow patience I like the way brother Branham described it he said there Moses words have said he had patience you remember isn't said he throwed that rod down as it become a snake he said to him other guys come over and they flip down their rods and said they become snakes and said o Moses was looking around you know then he never got excited he just waited and said just about that time glutton Moses snake ate up the others well what if he just took off running see see Flay row had no way called Pharaoh knew one thing let's see did he use the word cheap magician's trick or something like that kind of no brother branham used it I don't know words to direct written in the Bible chief magicians true anyhow he said that's just a trick said here thrown down he could do every thing that Moses could do but I love this one he could bring things but he couldn't take him away go read your Bible he could bring play road couldn't bring him but he couldn't take them away because that's definitely a different ministry can't be impersonated what about a church do you see what I'm getting building it higher and higher and higher and higher then we come to godliness they've gotten this to be added what is God in this mean he said he looked it up many dicks energy finally found one said godliness means to be like God to be like God what is godliness true godliness to be like God but be careful how you use that because that's Satan's approach also he wants to be asked God right is that the Bible say it wants to use that to me as God how what is it about being like God that would be to have God's faith God's virtue God's knowledge God's temperance and God's patience and that'll be like God right when random doesn't use the great definitions of being like God if you'll notice one thing in there is you're reading it I gave you the run off to you that have it I gave you the run off to occur and you basically through but if you'll notice one thing that always stuck with me that brother branham uses spends a lot of time emphasizing faith virtue knowledge and temperance he starts in temperance slowing down I don't mean that wrong but see he doesn't put in there a lot about he puts a good bit about patience then all at once then godliness he just said this to be like God he covered a few scriptures and go wrong because he's getting up to the place now where God can trust you double you got God to have God's faith virtue knowledge temperance patience and godliness to be like God alright then what does he say charity only give two or three paragraphs in the book that he speaks of charity and telling us about the dollar bill and it every things and showing how it was charity and all are doing you understand the further you go up the pyramid unless you gonna have to be propped up you don't have to prop it up you don't have to do this you want to do that you just have to believe it go on brotherly kindness you come to brotherly kindness and you say well I need brotherly kindness and what was his definition he said now brother maybe die and he said maybe you had a little problem and you didn't get around to making things right and said the brother paysanne he said you you really wanted to be able to go and talk to him right and get everything right brotherly kindness right brotherly kindness hoping someday and this is what I was doing going across the road and feel listen then put see brotherly kindness see see hoping someday see patient with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart now you listen to what I'm saying here the only way you could ever come to this one to have some godliness that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in the brotherly kindness brotherly kindness can we have God's patience with one another and how brotherly kindness you know some of you around here at shook hands with a with some of the other people in 10 years probably oh you meddling now well is it true I mean do we do we love one another I went to preach to the church one time telling some other the other day and I came out and I stood my wife and brother Gary Atkinson sister Rebecca and they were standing out to her sister I mean huh Margaret for the Geary's first while they were standing out there and I walked outside the church and I said uh hey yeah there's all over here and everybody else is over there I don't remember I said something to him they said we've been standing here the whole time I said nobody ain't come by and shook hands I said that ain't no problem I said I just got through preaching the sermon ain't nobody shook my hand yet didn't you call it brotherly kindness right just think about these things they asked me or they asked Louise is not in here F guess he doesn't know by what they ask him something the other day some people did he's telling us out there the other day and they've asked him kind of how brother Dale would and he said well brother Dale's right out there with the people and you'll notice if you'll stay around long enough I'll shake your lane I don't care phase 100 here or 500 I'm gonna shake your hand if I can I preached for a man one time walked out of the church and I was looking for him well forget it I didn't come here for him I just started cuz I knew all of his people I had preached our before word and everything you know I was going out through there shaking hands with everybody how you doing brother how you doing bro I don't why he come out there he says we're wondering where you that I said oh my you were the people well according to my understanding if you get to see him you got to pick out a certain number and he's you know you gotta have a ABC code to go through the Deacons and then that code can get to him you know the Deacon can cuz you ain't gonna talk to him well I can't do that ain't none of my business what he does but I can't do that I'm gonna shake your hand I want you to know I tell you those brothers I know I've got in trouble with this way could tell you about it he we've been places and and I'd walk up to pastors and preaching and say brother I Love You Man they've done you eat it and when I got into a bad guy here he's a little gay or something you know you know but you're gonna shake my hand and if I know you've got something against me and you're upset with me you gonna shake my hand cuz that's one thing I've got is a little bit of brotherly kindness yeah maybe a little bit okay let's go five more minutes brotherly kindness then you come to charity all right we can come to a lot of things about charity but I wanted to make one emphasis on to the last and then we'll pick up something about this Sunday of the Lord with it but I want you to think about one thing when you're looking at the pyramid and the things and you're seeing it says Holy Spirit right here and then it says love we all know that's the Holy Ghost all the way up and down but this is what I like what the prophets say it off the Statue of a perfect man paragraph 323 328 excuse me they can pull it up if they want to us the life's 113 all right now what does this do then you're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls and he's the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir thanks tell about the headstone which is love right down below that is the Holy Spirit now listen to it right in here right in here you see I got in between all these works in here here these little waves come what is that the Holy Ghost coming down through privacy the holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding it together building a what a perfect Church for the capstone to cap it off he put Holy Spirit in the right place because that's the one that seals it all together you want the headstone that stone can't come till we get all these virtues all right can't get out of here do we get these virtues okay these virtues are the nature of Almighty God each virtue is God's nature and each one is I've tried to cover is to be added one own to top of the other not just fling them out and you pick up what you want it's got to come the way God gives it and that's why he's been so patient with us waiting 50 years since the going of the profit waiting on us where he can add these things there's things in there that you and I cannot do and be so he has to add them to us but once he adds it to you it's yours you remember that now it's yours God give it to you when God gives you faith puts virtue on it knowledge given it's building the stature of a perfect man with his nature his makeup and bringing an individual to the place that we can walk off this earth one day come on musician think on these things I wanted to emphasize the virtues in a group like than to talk about it because some of those things don't seem to fit to human terminologies of what we're doing but it fits what the Prophet was do or what he was saying so it don't make no difference about us then it ain't up to us may I say one more time yeah how could of mankind ever received the statue of a perfect man if Peter had not preached it how could it be attained into in the end time until the Prophet come and brought the message the God has waited on you and I adoption he said to word that he could come and Phillips whatever fiber of our being take us in the rapture well I I just can't see brother Dale that ever happen within you're an unbeliever the best way to say it you know I'm believer coach prophet said it right I mean you could offend it at me know won't you get offended at him you know say brother Adam you shouldn't have said that about me no you know but her dad don't you see we try to use it to justify our own thoughts what we got brother let Stan thank own these things these virtues must be a part of our being and God has given us the opportunity what a fellowship water [Music] leaning on the everlasting [Music] [Applause] peacefully on the Everlast [Music] [Applause] I hope of trying to write like a prophet saying he's had a lot of temper and prophet said we had it but I got enough problems every didn't happen [Music] that's left at Buena decided between all the nose [Music] [Applause] have I become your enemy because I told man Santa's right have I become your enemy because I preach the wind the frogmen groaning if I'm in you have arrived or over come and save me [Music] [Applause] [Music] just remember the one guy if God requires you not how something he has to make the
