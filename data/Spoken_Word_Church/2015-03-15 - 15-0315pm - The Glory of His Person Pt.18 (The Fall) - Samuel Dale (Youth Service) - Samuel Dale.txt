things just remember now the fellowship meeting will be here saturday 3 30 so make sure and get all the plans ready and everything and brother matthew bray will be preaching for us for that and then some on the weekends so remember that and just pray that the lord would bless remember wade being coming home tuesday brett the lord would take care of him and give everybody a safe journey of course he's going to be starting out on a different time than we are so he'll be ahead of us before we think about praying for him so pray for him now see that's the best way but amen you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 1 and genesis 2. you've got a large thing to cover so i've jerked it back and i want to talk about the fall but i want to try to do it in a a way to break it up i guess into two services anyway because i got too much to try to get into one all right so let's just pray lord jesus we thank you for your grace your love your understanding thank you for you thank you for the fellowship lord thank you for the singing and truly as we were talking about this morning you'd rather have the worship the praise and the honor of your children than even the angels of heaven to be singing around you which you really enjoy them but yet you enjoy your people more we pray that you would receive that from us this day is what little bit of a praise and honor we could give unto you and that lord then you could you be satisfied with it forgive our sins and guide us and keep us let your love be with each one in jesus name amen all right genesis i mean revelations 1 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man glowed with a garment down to the foot and gerd about the paps with a golden girdle now we'll get back to that one day but i hope you're seeing that we're talking about lot now as we're beginning to pick up about the bride of christ and you'll see more then when we get into the sevenfold glory of his person in her being made manifest all right let's go to genesis 2 and we'll start in verse well let's start in verse 20. i think i gave him 21. and adam gave names to all the cattle and to the foul of the iron to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found and helped meet for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh and stood thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and you know if i jump around a little bit this afternoon uh like i said i want to divide this now we know i want to talk about the fall but i want to try to bring it in a way that will help us to understand and uh in doing it see we we know the physical aspect of a lot of things that we talk about in the garden and i want you to uh be lined up for that as we take a lot of that in the next message but i want this message to kind of be a uh thought pattern i guess you'd call it for understanding uh you know what we're we're doing but uh i did look up you know on the questions and answers and anybody else still has any more questions we will be glad to cover those things you know in any way in time that we can but i did look up some things because it was brought into relation uh to the part of the christ that we were talking about or the our christ coming forth and there's a lot in it in the spoken word is the original seed that talks about the christ in the way it should have been as a matter of fact we read this quote back before in the message but look what he says about it talking about uh this of adam and eve and the coming forth remember we were talking and i want to get this out of the way where can move on that how that if there had not been a fall then we would have come into being all right it would only bend the children of god to come into being but it would have been coming into being in the correct order but it was not done that away because now i want you to think about it because in genesis 1 26 and 27 you know covering that person that person was told on over another scripture to multiply and replenish the earth all right and i believe there would have been a spiritual multiplication of mankind had there not been a fall we would have come forth i believe that i we were predestinated and and would have been and they would have been a uh a whole lot better situation but yet it was not in god's plan to be that away but that's what i want you to look at and then relate it to the point listen to what brother branham says and go ahead and put that one up i think i gave it to him to put up first paragraph 147 and 161 of the spoken word is the original seed he said he is correctly the son that ad the from the he is correctly the son from the first adam was the son that was promised to adam continue on the human race and eve hybrid it to the to the serpent and brought forth a generation of bastard children born to death without alive that's pretty rough about eyesight and jesus came and was that seed he proved it everything that adam lost jesus was see he he's the correct eve would have finally brought that child forth but she hybrid brought the serpent in listening for wisdom understanding and knowledge all right now watch those things in a minute then he gets over to paragraph 161 he says all of god's sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in john 3 see to be born of the water and spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place where you should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of christ's death bring us back right back again to two were sons of god if eve would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not god tell her multiply and replenish the earth so it would have happened had it not been that the fall came into being but the fall didn't change anything that was the main point i was wanting you to see and i always have wanted you to see that the fall didn't change didn't you know we think the fall was a horrible thing it was but it helped god display his attributes all right and in doing that then it wasn't so bad and that's the reason i want to kind of divide up the message this afternoon in in trying to get a little understanding about this person we talk about of you know eve and the fall and what took place and we won't go into the natural things we're going to stick with the spiritual because see before eve could have had any natural act before any woman can have any natural act with a man she must first accept him right here in her brain in her being that part of her that thinking that end that we call the spirit realm that has to work before it can happen in any form of natural so let's cover that spiritual part to think about it in a way that maybe you had never uh put it as to doing because like i said most preachers they just jump over to what happened you know well now remember drinking gambling smoking running around is not sin am i correct what is those things attributes of unbelief unbelief is the sin what was displayed is not the that much it's a attribute of the sin all right see before eve then could do anything naturally she accepted satan's lie and become perverted in the realm part of her in the spiritual part then the physical could take place so as we go on into that maybe the next message we'll we'll cover some of the natural to get back and and understand but i want your mind to stay with me in this part of the message to to understand that uh i don't look at eve as such a horrible person as a lot of people tries to make her and you know and i know see i've read the message i'm not blind to the points that brother branham would say she was made that way but now what's he talking about you know i mean that's as honest as i can say what's he talking about if she was made wrong how can god judge her for being wrong well she would just made that away all right you explain that now how was she made was she made a horrible situation remember god created both male and female now how was that condition what was it what was it in the garden that has been so outlandishly preached about women until they're just dog meat you know they're just no hopes whatsoever for them you know because there's a whole situation and then you turn around and take that same woman and bring christ from the woman you see what i'm saying we just we run our ideas and we don't think about the you know the the problem we don't think about the situation we just uh our thoughts well she was made wrong i was even looking at one there a moment ago because i happened to think of it that brother branham said satan was her designer now what do you mean brother branham you know brother branham said she was made wrong what do you mean brother branham all right said satan was her designer what do you mean because without an answer to what you mean you're making him say something that's a horrible situation i would consider a little bit the thoughts that maybe i might lay down some of my you know 40 years i've studied this out and i found out she ain't nothing but dog meat well you know your mama was a dog meat then oh but let's leave mama out of it yeah that's the way you want to be you know well but see we get into a lot of situations and we we think we've got it all figured out but does it pan out with the bible all right you say well are you saying brother brown was wrong no i'm saying he's right when he made statements but i'm saying he knows what he's talking about when he said he satan was her designer was he standing up there with god and i said okay now god what i want you to do now i know you don't mate adam but said what i want you to do now is you make her over this way and you shape her over this way and you do her over that away i i don't think so did he give god a set of blueprints you know now make her this away i don't think so and if you're saying brother branham said it on the basis he designed her wrong be careful how you say it that he said it because he said i believe he knew what he's talking about don't you all right well then did he design her there or is brother branham talking about that he's her designer now or has been her designer since the fall is he talking about the fall or something that he helped god design oh now folks let's get down to sensible thinking you know the facts of the matter of what we're making things see he is her designer but go read how the prophet talks about how he that satan is her designer he said with beauty now is anything wrong with being pretty anything wrong with beauty i believe and i'll quote him he said eve was the most beautiful woman in the world you know what got me listening to him one day because we always wondered herself what she looked like and he describes her and he says standing there now if i get this wrong you correct me but i believe he said standing there with that blue eyes and blonde hair i'm i'm you know i'm pretty sure i know he's talking about the eyes and i know he's talking about the blonde hair and the things is there anything wrong with the way she was made when she was in adam you know that while eve was in adam she had no ability to make any choice you know what she couldn't do wrong while she was an atom it wasn't a choice right there was no way to do wrong while she was in adam it's when she's removed that the situation begin but let's don't make it something that's reno said we'll try to divide this up a little bit let's don't make it something that makes the the woman the horrible looking part because you better remember and i've got it in here we'll get to at a while you know the bible says and adam all died doesn't say an eve now adam had a right to have rejected eve and this wouldn't have happened so when adam all die he's the one that sold the human race it would have been a matter of just destroying her but we know he loved her he done all of that you can in a way use it to type a little bit of christ in the church but don't type too far because remember he was taking a bad product back and god commands us not to do that so that's you be careful how you use things but i want your mind to just stay in a simple matter with me this afternoon and i didn't bring a lot of quotes i i just wanted to to use this part you know that eve was made beautiful she was made perfect but even the flesh of adam was not made eternal but how else can you describe it it was made perfect i think that was a beautiful little couple that was standing in the garden and i think god looked down upon them and says that's what i want to be in my church too i call i believe adam and eve was the best type of christ in the church could ever be you know because they were created perfect they were made right everything was going great but then we know to try to get this into the thought that you'd say well why didn't god leave it that way well he had attributes he wanted to display so he couldn't leave it in a situation of even adam in the garden all right now i've told you what i believe and told you some things this morning that i've always tried to teach and believe it that way all right i believe adam was made adam body spirit and soul because it takes that to make a human being all right then god breathed into the nostrils of adam and gave him eternal life as i try to explain that point because it's always been to me that if you just say well god created a body and a spirit and then he just put his life in there of eternal life then that's not adam you got to get the identity the person the doings of adam into the world all right now to me so would you have to do with eve and like i said i don't mind telling you because i don't have any problems that way you can say well that's your that's just your belief well okay you got them too so we'll sit down and talk about them but see i believe eve was my body coming from adam spirit coming from the feminist part that was in adam that we'll get to in a minute and soul as eve and then god gave her eternal life and would start the church his brother henry greene used to say quoting rhetoric i reckon i never did look it up but said that god started his church the way he wanted it and he wanted it the way he started it it's a good thought because what happened in the garden would have to be the type of christ in the church whatever finishes this situation would have to be the exact example of what started you can't start with this and wind up with that so then you've got to start perfect in your creation so what went wrong in the creation of eve it was not fleshly things because fleshly things do not work by themselves the bible says the body without the spirit is what dead it's so much in the human being until no matter how much you are in your thinking and still running right but if you tap that spine and the different things or something that will cut off the channels then the body is totally useless right so without the spirit to motivate it now i'm going to say this and i'll say it a couple of times where you won't misunderstand me i am not just talking about when we talk about the feminist part taken from adam and put into eve i'm not talking about just the spirit part to come into being i'm talking about a multiple point or many ways of looking at eve and and trying to comprehend her and what she is but dealing with the spirit realm right all right that way we can hold it to a point that that you wouldn't be then saying well brother dale god made her all right and soul he made her all right body but he made a wrong spirit you're just as far off as you are anywhere else you don't make any part that god made of eve to be wrong make it to be a beautiful creation one because that was what god wants in you and i amen and i will go ahead and say this because i know it's in people's minds to think and i know they did because brother branham when he said he said but you say brother branham said uh adam died he said before he died he had an atonement right now remember quick as he done something we were talking about in the bible study the other night i think it would remember as quick as adam done something right there's where he died right quick as he's done wrong right there's where she died now what's brother brown saying see the atonement was before the sin ever come no no no he didn't he didn't no he didn't do the animals until after the fall yeah but he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world let's get in the bible before the foundation of the world there's already an atonement made because one second right in the presence of god in the line of sin you would have to annihilate the center so adam and eve would immediately been destroyed as quick as eve done wrong she'd have been destroyed the apple would have never got to adam she'd have been annihilated but the atonement was already made because god knew what he's going to do he knew he was going to allow it to come into being to be that right because he's going to display his attributes all right he had to make man which man and woman you know on the basis of what we talk about as freemore agency which is a right to choose all right making you where you can choose he made adam and eve both where they could choose we say well now adam couldn't do it well he did be careful how you say things sometimes you you you you get caught you say well adam couldn't do wrong i got where brother around said that amen okay but then when he accepted eve he went wrong right just don't ever get to the point to think church that because you got the baptism of the holy ghost that you can't do wrong when you do that you're in a horrible situation satan is more than your designer he doesn't got your brain but think about it god did not make us wrong because he could not do that and be judged right but if he'd make us right knowing that we would do wrong then he can now give us a choice and it's left up to you and i but don't blame adam and eve for your problem today right don't blame adam and eve for the wrong that well i just can't help being this way adam and eve sold me out they never sold you out you sold yourself out when you made a choice you had a choice you're a free mortal agent you kids you got a choice you're free more relations you can choose to do right or wrong and the choices you make early in life are valuable to a lot of things if a lot of us had changed our choices in early life we wouldn't have been so messed up in a later life right all right all right before we get into and i wrote it like this before we get too much into the thought of what took place in the garden in the acts and the things you know let's remember that those are attributes to be displayed so let's get down to see what the bottom line of it is as i said brother brown said satan was her designer but we know that he never told god how to make her he designed her after she got here her beauty and her doings and started using that right if you make it to the point that he made it wrong body spirit or soul either one then god cannot judge you for being wrong see we want to put all the blame back on eve and adam first corinthians 15 22 and adam all die he sold the human race into sin he knew what he was doing that's when the bible said that adam was not deceived he knew exactly what was taking place sure he loved eve and that that was the point and i'm glad he did because it might have ended all up with adam and we wouldn't have got here but see let's don't try to put any blame upon adam and eve let's look at the thing ourselves because the bible says that he was speaking about eve and he said lest satan tempt you as he did eve through his septility see if he told you you can't do wrong he's got you deceived all right let's look at it then in the part of the fall as we talk about it that in the garden in the beginning god made everything perfect right and then satan saw one ability that he could do and use they said then it's not the natural thing that we need to look at because that was not what took place first satan never uh just overpowered eve there's really no telling how long that took place because there was no records and times and things you know and you know i've always thought about it i've thought about uh if my wife kept hanging around an animal which we know the the beast and what it was it looked like a human then i i'd want to know why she wanted to hang around the animal all the time but you know evidently god took that away from adam's mind you ever thought that a way god took that away in other words he kind of blindsided him with it some way or whatever the words you want to use because adam never questioned eve about what she was doing but she started hanging around this beast that we talk about the missing link between man and the monkey the upright creature and you know it could talk and you know that he began to tell eve what she was made for and you know what he told her the truth was not she made for reproduction was not they already told in the spiritual condition to multiply and replenish the earth but you understand what i'm getting at he saw one situation that he could deal with he couldn't go to her body and say her body was made wrong because it wasn't he could not go to the soul because the soul wasn't made wrong and it was correct so what did he begin to do he began to get her to reason to think now you can see then what my main point of the message will be that in the spiritual realm of eve he begin to deal with her right through her memory reason which didn't have any memory of what remember this got something started but it's still memory reason conscious affections and things and you know the woman was made different from the man you see it kind of get messed up nowadays and a lot of things but that's something we can't do anything about but she was made on a motherly instinct whereas the male is made up on the working the building doing you know homes whatever kind of you don't hear brother random talking about eve you know you as blue and you hear him talking about eve along the side of adam hugged up and walking down through the garden with no problems and thing but then you hear adam as tree move wind slow down you'll hear those statements in brother brown's message because he's signifying the man as the male dominance part the protective you know the leadership the guidance and for the woman to have the feminist part to where that she would be under subjection to that all right i made a statement the other day and it was brought back to my attention that i said you women be careful you've got to have a head well it doesn't matter if you're a sinner or a saint sisters you got to have a head you honor your head and god will honor you you dishonor your head god will dishonor you well if he made my husband a different kind of a guy i might honor him some that was not the way that it says it you know it doesn't actually come out that way all right okay looking at the difference in the way adam and eve was made not to deal with the physical because you tell me there's anything wrong with the physical part now come on i mean if you can find something wrong with the physical part then god can't condemn you for that right so we can't be by dealing with soul and body we have to be dealing with this part that the brother adam would call the spiritual realm and he'd say that the feminist part of adam now today we got a lot of them that we call it getting in contact with their wrong side and you see them you know little feminist acting guys you know uh we say they got the wrong spirit then we say well the woman you know she's robust and go and do it and said she got the wrong spirit she's got the man's spirit well they can be some things medically maybe that deals with some of that but i don't deal with it too much i deal with it on on the basis of thinking about you and i we have a choice so then think about that there is adam standing there with this male and female parts but not in his body he doesn't have two sets of parts okay get rid of that one all right and you see if you get rid of that one you're not going to be so strong on the next one that i try to bring out all right so get rid of that part when he took a a rib from adam it wasn't a female rib that just happened to get stuck in there some way in creation right right it's examples or stories are telling what you're doing so he took part of adam's body and from that body and my wife are not the same dna but adam and eve would have been the same dna right because it would have been the whole it would have been the one person all right but do away with that feminist part of what you're trying to think about but don't think that adam one day you know i know i'm not tough but something motivating me then the next day he's oh yeah i feel it i got a little bit a little bit silly today okay just gotta get rid of all that because that's what falls in your mind what you think about think about what happens in your reasoning your memory your consciences and your affections and things a man in his memory reason and things is not supposed to think feminist right all right he's supposed to think of masculine now the woman in her feminists is not supposed to think of masculine points and things he's supposed to be motivated by different things the female is made with the motherly instinct you see it in the animals you see it and all of the things that that motherly instinct is dwelling in the female sector whereas the male is he's just out and gone you know it might give you a little better idea of what happened in the garden it might make you think a little bit about what took place there and what takes place now right now i said a woman she she can't go uh with an ill uh a wrong act with a man until she thinks things over and we're not talking about rapes we're not talking about slap down knockout drunks something we're talking about sensible life and doings you know but there's just something different between a man and a woman my wife she wants everything fixed and done and you know now i don't want it to slunk around but i don't spend that much dwelling with it and now i do get up my clothes out of the bathroom and carry them to the to the clothes dryer i ain't that bad to leave everything just laying around saying that's your job remember brother dale he doesn't get along with a lot of people about his stance stance or what you call it my position you know because i'm like this brothers if you're be real if you're real bad about well you ain't got my suffer cooked and she's been at work all day long remember she's doing your job oh brother dale talks rough don't he you know well you're the woman you're supposed to be the cooking well you're the man you're supposed to be making a living well i do the best i can get you two jobs that's right and i know today it's basically you can't exist on one income i know that but i just don't make it right you know that just makes it in a situation we're living in but i'm just straight and honest and blunt too my wife never worked she worked about probably three months out of her married life and that was right after we got married and wade came along and and she got laid off because they'd cut back it to work and that tickled me to death and you know whis crowns for a living sure we didn't have too much money when if i was making 42 dollars a week when we got married so you can figure we wouldn't make it too good but i still didn't want her to work i wanted her to stay at home and i told her the day that they called her back which she was the first one they called back when they put the shift back on you know because she was a good worker and they liked her but i said you you know you make the choice you stay at home with the kids and and take care of that and i'll make a living or i'll stay at home with the kids and you make a living she knows i told her lately and you got to remember we might have been making 60 dollars a week by then but i still meant it because that's just the way i stand well brother dale you you're against me and my wife and i said that between what you and your wife's doing is your business that ain't my business i'm just talking like it's supposed to be all right so you wouldn't have a lot of problems if you didn't put out those situations but of all soap and blood you're right brothers and sisters right i've never tried to fool around deceiving i've said if i've married some of you me and i'd have three jobs i would i would never be in the house okay i get by of that mostly you can't talk that away but listen being serious now what's the difference to man to woman you go by what you're looking at or something i don't i watch people in their nature and their doings and things i try to read the inside more than the outside because the outside can be deceiving but that inside i watch that i see real true sisters that are real true sisters you know and i thank god for them i see men that are some good men you know very few but some and i thank god for them but then all of this other is a mess up thing that we're in life with but that ain't got nothing to do with you and i well brother dale it's just not according to the world today well now are you going to write revelations chapter 14 i mean chapter 24 what was that and brother randomly said because you could write chapter 23 or something you know are you going to write up 24 or 25 and try to make it right because of the situations of life no no we're supposed to be the other way all right but think about it what realm do you deal in if you deal in things that go wrong i'm serious what realm do you deal in when you think about things going wrong when it's not the bodily part and it's not the soul part what realm are you dealing with when emotional life your memory your reason your conscience and a lot of other things that goes in there and see that's where satan then he knew what he could do he saw the one not weakness that god made because now come on you get the story right and and you don't have to worry about all of these fantasies you try to drum up remember eve never had no memory of something wrong right so don't deal like that he didn't see a weakness that god would make it to where there'd be some weakness that he could deal with satan just knew her makeup and her beings now quote the prophet he said satan had a knowledge of the principles of life now what is having the knowledge of the principles of life what life consists of you know all right so he knew he couldn't touch her body right come on i don't want to be blunt but i want to be playing the female the male dog don't get around to female until the right time right because he'll get whooped so you don't deal with those type of things get away from that get down to the point of what i'm trying to drive and you you'll see what life is about right so satan looked and he looked her over and he tried to do everything and he thought well there's got to be some way for me to get into the human race because that was his desire right so he begins to talk to her through the beast right he begins to talk to her and after a while he detects a open door that he can dwell in now hearers were to me that eve went wrong because the beasts begin to say you can do this you can do that getting into her conscience part of her she wound up being a good woman preacher and that's where your sister's messed up if you want to know of anything brother dale where it went wrong at that's where it went wrong i wasn't the one that said a woman is a thousand times easier to be deceived than the man i didn't write that i'm sorry but as he begins to talk to eve she begins to preach to him surely the beasts begin to tell her you know satan through that this is what you were made for you were made to be this well that's true show me one lie that the devil told eve not until it got over there where it said we shall not the only way you can go with it right the adding of the one word not is the only thing you're going to get with the devil because the other part of what he's telling her is exactly right that's why paul said be careful let satan through his septility deceive you as he did eve well there is he begin to talk to her things begin to develop not in the wrong things that's where you're going to go wrong with all you want to run it into some playboy magazine deal you're running into the wrong thoughts he could've never contacted eve that away neither does a woman run off with a man that way it's when she suckered into it or talked into it or brought into it what did brother run say not the old man with the overalls you got to watch around your wife while he illustrating like that he said that slick tongue guy right see that's what satan began to do through the beast is just talk to her and she began to preach back to him he said can you eat of these trees she said well i got you well we can eat of every one of them except one she got a good sermon no i wasn't the one that said it brother branham said eve was the first woman preacher now so you argue it all you want to she began to preach to him and she got good anointed with it right didn't happen in a five minute period could have been years and years of earthly time that this situation would go on daily daily daily of the discussions and things and satan telling her 99.9 truth because she was made for that purpose of reproduction she was made for the purpose of being a mother all of those things contact the woman through her spiritual part of her now you tell me anything else that was took out of adam but you tell me don't take that out of that i'm wrong like i said we're not silly he wasn't silly over here one day and manly over here and he took one of them out he's born right now what are you talking about it's simply that the feminist part of adam that was to be placed into flesh to bring forth a beautiful woman that would be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and what would it be that's why we misquote the scripture we say he made him help mate that ain't even the bible it doesn't say help mate it says help meet m-e-e-t look up the difference in the word mate and meet two men can be mates two women be mates but meat mens of products are the same value are coming from that are being won with that had she taken her emotional situation home to adam and talked with him about things and i believe they did see because the devil according to brother branham just finally got to the point of saying hey look adam didn't tell you these things plain language paraphrase he didn't tell you these things she said well i figured it out myself now you women preachers fuss all you won't do at me about it some of you women intelligence wise my wife is if you checked our intelligence mine might be 40 and hurt 80 or 90 but and i don't say that wrong i say it right a lot of you women are smarter intellectual minded than your husband okay because we're in the day when the feminist thing has flourished upward to where that women have to have a job and have to do things and all but that still don't make you smarter right they still don't change that you're a thousand times easier to be deceived it's just got to be somebody that knows how to do it right i looked at some women that rose up in our community and the men that they wound up dating as we call it and i thought what is wrong with these women that old stinking chewing tobacco garbage can right dirty stinking and you see them they wouldn't even talk to a guy that was halfway decently clean why come on women i'm talking to you why because he knows how to handle his words he knows how to talk to you how many of you girls ever dated a guy and you walk up to and say hi and he said get away from me are you ugly looking slot i bet there was never another thought about dayton right but he starts dealing with you on how beautiful you are and how that you're just wonderful and you're just eating out of his hand heard the other day where there was a a 90 year old pig you'll remember the other story but a 90 year old woman matt was telling me about it that she got her a 40-something-year-old friend a guy you know and he's done built her out ever once you use that word and cheated her out of almost 500 000 that she had in the bank and she's got 19 000 left because matthew knows the story because a lot of us in the state farm hookup you know peggy knows the story about the one we read in the paper the other day where this lady was 90 years old and his two this man father and son cheated her out and he has to pay back 3.4 million and the other guy has to pay back almost a half a million you know ain't gonna never get it but you know how that is they got to pay it back well that means it's cheated that poor woman out of probably what 10 million dollars or maybe even more then you tell me women can't be deceived you know not a lot of me entered that way too lost a lot but just get the point i said i wanted to break it up into a point of looking at something different from what we always look at it we just look at it well so we we're in the message we know what happened in the garden he didn't eat no apple we know all about it we're tied together with what paul said talking to who who would fault talking to christians the bible's not written centered he's talking to christians don't be like eve and be deceived through his septility and then you got the woman coming along and said god called me to preach okay think on these things as satan began through he through the beast to talk to eve he contacted her parts that was not something wrong feministly he contacted her inward being and he began to get her to reason about things to think about things to see new light am i talking about the way the prophet would say it she was searching for new wisdom new light i've never had any problems with letting my mind run on a scale to where that maybe she might have even walked back to e to adam and said adam you know i began to talk to this beast over here these things he's telling me that you ain't told me he said eve it's not time leave it alone he said well you don't know about that well neither you don't know it ain't right either so forget it all right the point is he found a way to approach eve to where that she would fall into his trap and willingly give herself later physically to that a woman give herself to an animal because that's what that was it was a beast young girls maybe we need to have some more time together we had a time one time that was going gonna take all the girls and my wife we went in together and sat down and we talked about life to the girls you know and we never did get to the boys and maybe that's where it started with the boys i guess but girls figure it out real quick in life right i got three up here today i don't know why you went up here on the front row someone talked to you watch him slick tongue lit around and what did he say what that little girl say something he said something about that boy she said but he smelled so good and what did say had pretty feet i believe that's right on my right had pretty feet and smells good he said i wouldn't care if he stunk like a some kind of horse or something and had feet like car boxes said if his heart was right remember girls the boy's trying to deceive you and what he's going to try to contact you with is what's in here amen connected down through your whole being to where that you're made different and very easy to be deceived you know like i say you ain't going to say hi to them boys they say get out where you ugly wood you just you don't leave them alone don't let people deceive you by their sweet tongue because that's what it always does okay so are you getting a point to what went wrong with eve that god never made her wrong satan just saw the one thing that he could work on and that was her emotions and as i said he got her started by getting her to preach to him oh you're so smart why i'm the right-hand man said you know you remember satan was the anointed child stood beside the lord he said i'm i know all about these things i said you're bringing things to me that i didn't even understand satan is a very deceiving thing but you see if you're getting the point eve didn't have no weakness we have weaknesses right we have weaknesses because of our inheritable traits and characteristics and doings but he never had a weakness that god made her weak to where that she could be no so if he could tackle the part if he could tackle this the one that was made correct don't you ever think ladies that he can't tackle you come on eve didn't have no wrong thoughts he didn't have no wrong reasonings and things to go wrong and he was able to deceive her right we're made with reasons that's our whole makeup what do you understand do you understand the weak the part that eve that he could get to then he could take her to the wrong things and body but he had to get that part first and deceiver might i bring it to a close with one thing of saying don't ever think just because you're born again that you can't be deceived i would ask you to remember that a lot of you claimed that you had the new birth before you heard of the message i'm not saying you didn't now i just said some of you you know and you as trinitarians and you with all kind of things with the cut hair and the pants and the makeups and the things and you still was just you thought it was right well evidently the devil already had you deceived because you sure fought when the truth is brought right and i remember my wife's reasoning to show you and i'm throwing off on her i'm telling the truth because she knows it happened and when we got to talking about the haircutting and the things you know it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair well you know what she said and violet did y'all remember violet how she used to roll her hair up and the things you know and fix it and made it up and it was kind of rolled up because most of the women you know fixed it up and brought it up and she said well look at violet her hair's shorter than mine the way it looked it was you know well i said honey that ain't the point the point is it don't make no difference and she's bald-headed right maybe not the words i used in but she's ball-headed and not cutting her her hair's as long as anybody's in the world listen it's not the length of the hour it's the fact of where it was being cut or not and we used to get into some pretty good discussions some people called it argument we called it discussions and you know what blame it on me one day i finally said honey just read this and uh she sat down and she read it and she said because her hair is her covering she said why didn't you ever tell me that i said we got mad enough before we got down to that part i forgot about it again but you know she never had no more trouble because she read it in the scripture that her hair is recovering and there never was another word about her hair it wasn't mentioned right but you see how easily satan can deceive us just don't ever think you can't be deceived yeah but i'm a born-again christian i can't be deceived you can't be deceived in long enough to be lost you can't you cannot be lost if you're a christian right we agree but remember through satan's septility you know that he you can argue this and a lot of people have argued it but you ain't going to argue with this boy about it brother branham said it was a bride that went down to narcia people would say no he didn't no it didn't well you better keep reading i can't believe it then others come up with a good one well they went down there and they and i there's a quote they went down there and they left immediately may i state it to you because you don't read a lot but at the first nicean council at 3 25 a.d it was not over whether there was three gods or one god it was whether jesus was of another substance or a demon god you know another substance funny they're doing that now with the river jordan doctrines that they say he wouldn't god then become god god left him that's gonna yeah but you see these are the words paraphrasing it when the people went down their shore they stood up there and fought a lot of those things and a lot of them died at those councils prophets came in eating herbs and things and and trying to get the bride out of it right but it don't matter who it was and went out of there and didn't take it they took those doctrines with them by 606. 325 a.d they started 606 they already had the biggest portion of the world caught into their septility of the trinity that started with that one man saying that he's a like substance you see how easy satan is deceiving it doesn't matter to him how long it takes to get to your mind he'll deal with you day in and day out and he'll talk with you hey if he don't talk to you would you mind if i send him over your way you know you say when i wake up in the morning i say good morning lord most of the time i said devil heidi how you doing today because that's generally the first one that contacts me are you truthful the worst problem is is to call him the lord and be the devil right that's the worst part i wanted to get this part into our thinking then we wouldn't have no trouble when we go to the physical to start talking about you know physical matters and situations but just remember that spirit within you right now even though you're a born-again believer that spirit is still subject to satan and his ways i agree with brother level i believe was when he made the statement now if it wasn't him he said we need a baptism of the holy ghost on our brain well i'd agree with that probably help a lot because your spirit works through your brain it is not your brain now don't go that way it just works through there because that spirit realm is a part of us that reasons satan comes through and speaks to us that way but you know what god has to speak through those things too i don't understand how that he can pass through all of the wrong thinkings and things that in life and get to us to save us i don't understand that you know what because as quick as i start to try to do something wrong the bible said evil is present with me is that paul think on these things what was the big problem in the garden was for eve to listen to the beast and let him deceive her what's the biggest problem today preachers and the bride of christ listening to him i told you 40 something years ago i said you think that these doctrines and things that's going around today is very deceiving i said there's nothing like it's going to be i said it's going to come to a time that they're going to be quoting brother branham to the letter the old days they couldn't quote him to the letter because they didn't have the letter they had parts of it right but nowadays a preacher can get up to you and he can say i know this is right cause i got 240 quotes but if you got one quote that doesn't fit are you going to throw it as a weightier matter that the weightier the matter the more more proof you got the more quotes you got and you know i love to quote him but you know i can take it and twist it any way i want to you know the only way you're going to know whether the person preaching to you is right or not is for you to be in the word for you to study it out for you to think it over and for you to talk to god about it right because satan is a very deceiving being and if he could deceive eve that had no problems no strong no wrong thing a beautiful situation but he could take that and gradually work through her until he could bring the whole human race right see adam he didn't have no one to talk to him to try to get him deceived one brother used to preach how the female beast used to flirt around with adam but i don't care about that that was his thoughts but just think go home today and just sit down for a while or days and time till next service and just think can i be deceived i know what it is in the preacher's realm it's it's the hardest thing in the world to try to get a preacher to think because he's in any way deceived because remember he's led to the lord he's called of the lord right you remember it was in the good old baptist said say if i deny the father then i would deny the son so i can't deny there being three gods right come on musicians think on these things what is the fall because remember it's still got to be here right and now it's not satan trying to get you to do as much wrong physically he don't go to the beer joints in the hockey tongue he ain't there he's in church right right that's where he can do the most deceiving he's quit trying to tell people there were laws now he's telling i mean that they were they couldn't be lost now he's telling you let me get it right he used to say that you was lost now he's saying you're saved okay i'll get it right well you know you're saved you believe the message i said that one time about something and the person said well you know well they believe the message i said so did the devil does that make him saved no what do we got boys 2 28 let's stand together jesus whole mind anybody have a need i hope you take this and go home with it in the thoughts of your mind and then we'll try to relate the physical and the spiritual land what about it you have a need foreign jesus to take away that situation let your love be there mate manifest in jesus name so whatever the need is you take care of that and be with this one this is gonna

to be the test and all they run we believe they're going to be all right but we thank you for it in jesus name anybody else do you believe don't let satan talk through that mind drop them down inside to worry you could just say that's the way it is i'm going to take god's word lord jesus we send this birth clause our sister has a need for it we believe you you'll take care of it in jesus name let's go like anybody that's your desire lord jesus this goes back and he talks you don't ever thank him for your salvation every night when i wake up lord thank you look what you give me look at the
