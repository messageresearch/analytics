12-0610 -   The Birthright Pt.4 - Bob Black
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we've been talking on we've been going down through uh the genealogy of uh of uh Christ and Matthew one and um Luke and talking about the birth right and what that means and why um the uh birth right was given to Joseph and the scepter was given to Judah that's where we're going anyway um and you know I think I think a lot one of my favorite quotes is um this something that uh Einstein said that if you don't really understand it you can't explain it if you if you uh so uh if you could kind of distill down into the the core element the simplest form of what the birthright is it's the promise of many nations that uh out of many nations that we would come and that's really if you know brother Brown said the birthright is the Seal of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost the promise that we would be out of many nations we would be redeemed and uh to what I'm doing is kind of going through the scripture to to kind of prove that um so let me just outline again kind of the where the genealogy goes and this is I I think this is so beautiful how you know we started at Abraham and uh he was promised uh all the different attributes of the the birthright promised many nations is the core and the attributes are that with the Kings and Priests would come out of that and uh the land would be the youd get the promise of the land and um so forth and then Isaac the promis sea and then Jacob and then uh the birth right was given to Joseph and the SE to Judah and uh coming on down this was really manifested when Solomon son riab if you remember Solomon uh he T he T he heavily taxed the Israelites to build a temple and then RI came along after saw his son and said I'm going to continue those taxes but I'm going to tax you even greater so everybody got upset and said uh zob uh the the uh Israel wasit into the tribe of Judah riab riab was came from lineage of Judah and remember back here uh the birth right was given to Joseph and and uh Jacob crossed his hands and blessed Ephraim which was the younger and Ephraim uh guess which tribe J was from sorry not do need a computer so um you got kind of a type of The Many Nations and the Judah is going to bring forth the Messiah the Redeemer and redeemed and um so that's that's kind of what I see and remember uh Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 37 I don't know if I'm going to have time to get to this the next few weeks but Ezekiel 37 he talked about the um the bones that would uh the cross side of the four stages that the church would go through the b s coming on and the wind and right after that he talks about two sticks the two sticks are Judah and Ephraim Israel in in throughout the Old Testament Ephraim is known called by Israel Joseph from but it's think think of it as the promise of many nations and those two sticks become joined the uh Redeemer and redeem and uh so it's not just a natural that Israel is going to come back they Homeland it's the uh the promise of our Union with Christ so let us um we talked about how the birthright is the Seal of God um the physical blessings the spiritual blessings Blessed Be those who bless you cursed be everyone that curses you um the we went through the pro the promise of many nations Jeremiah 3 see Genesis 175 through6 um where God promises to Abraham to make him the father of many nations and um and Romans Paul said who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations mhm and he's talking about us um and uh so where I wanted to start today was um God's promise to Sarah cuz he didn't make a different promise to Sarah and a different promise to Abraham Sarah was included in his promise to Abraham just like we are included in the promise that we are included in uh God's promises to to Christ Jesus and that's what uh brother BR said in believing God 1952 um against hope believed in hope that he might be the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead not circumstances not what somebody else said well if somebody else died when you got the same thing don't consider it see she was included in it God never gives Sarah the promise he give he give Abraham the promise but Sarah was included he made the promise in Christ Jesus and I was included in him you were too see so let's turn to Genesis 14 let me can I interject the point here yeah go ahead remember ephra Dan and Ephraim was kicked out down here but they're going to be redeemed in the Millennium so that's where your redeemed come from that's good that's why I saw that when you put cuz down in Ephraim was kicked out and Joseph and Levi was put in when Joseph and Levi was going to be took back out cu Joseph is Christ Levis are us and d and Ephraim is going to be put back in so they're the redeemed M so there your T right perfect yeah and remember why they were kicked out was because they yep jeroboam set up a an altar in in Dan and in vessel and yep all the uh that uh God remembered that on the 144,000 so uh all the Levites went over Judah ended up being uh Judah tribe of Judah uh little Benjamin and the Levites when they couldn't come back to Jerusalem the worship uh a good portion of it went back to Judah to Worship in Jerusalem so that Judah ended up being Judah benjam and and a good portion of Levis um so to be redeemed you had to have been somewhere fell from it and then come back to right familiar that familiar we were in the plan of God right went after FAL ble God kicked us out down here but then the choice we made puts him back in the choice they make puts him back in that makes them redeemable the other ones weren't redeemable the ones were outside to dve that's yes do means a lot yes it does oh let's see where was I at Genesis 17 14 sorry about that oh sorry Genesis 17:4 this is the promise of uh to Abraham as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham the father of many nations have I made thee and then uh Genesis 17:16 is where a Sarah is included in that um and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yeah I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people she shall be of her so she was included in that amen now um just to see where um The Many Nations come from let's turn over to Acts chapter 2 where are the many nations goes to and uh let's look at verse n acts one chapter 2 act two acts two let's start at verse five so they were the uh baptism of the Holy Ghost came 5 and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised to braw the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and Marvel saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born arthans and me and Elites and the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and Judea and caposa in pontis and Asia friia and pilia and Egypt and in the parts of Libya about sirene and strangers of Rome Jews and Crites people from all around the world PRS and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God so this was witnessed by the people of many nations EP that's uh let me just write up here you and me mhm make it personal praise the Lord and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what mean is this others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words and uh he he told how to uh gave the keys to enter the kingdom and uh let's get down to uh verse 39 or 38 uh the the keys to enter the kingdom repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call not just one nation the Israelites but as many as the Lord Our God shall call all the all the nations and I I believe that's the birthright blessing and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this uncor generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized in the same day they were added unto the about 3,000 Souls from many nations um so let's uh uh let's see I have some things written down in brother R said about many nations in the Investments he said our Father Abraham which is the father of many nations if there happened to be Jewish people sitting here sitting near wonder how the Gentiles was brought in Abraham was the father of many nations and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief he held a policy also God had made him a promise to be father of many nations not only the Hebrew Nations but other nations that he would be father of you know I posted I I there's a little message board that I just kind of post things on I I asked the question what is the birth right and U most people today uh don't don't really have I mean where would we be without a prophet to show us these things am the birth right isn't just land and uh double double possession and natural things but it's something more precious than gold I I remember um years ago uh the sister that um influenced my parents to come into the message she was a um message believer that um my mom red with in in college and uh after after they were introduced to the message she said um you know brother Bram didn't really teach us anything that we didn't already know and I that stuck with me that many people think that this is just a uh I I'm just glad God has opened our eyes that's right so uh the the birthright is a blessing of many nations that the people that didn't remember brother told that story about The Mule the firstborn mule I had to be think about that it's you and me that has to be Redeemed by the lamb come going take that didn't deserve anything okay um so now let's uh talking about Sarah and kind of keep in context we we've been talking about that um there's not a natural genealogy there's not a natural there a spiritual and so let's go to Galatians 4:22 and Paul here is he's speaking of the Bond woman and the free woman and I believe this is the scripture that brother Brown used and the C's not able to shut um Paul's trying to tell the Jews that to explain to them the the superiority of Christianity or of Judaism that uh in Galatians 4:22 he said tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law that the law spoke of something greater that there's a uh uh the circumcision of the flesh spoke of the circumcision of the heart that uh something greater to come for it is written that Abraham two had two sons the one by upon me the other by free woman but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of free woman was by promise which things are an alory for these are the two covenants the one from the Mount Si which gendereth to bondage which is AAR an allegory is uh Paul using these big words uh an allegory is is like a story or just a picture that can be we can that helps you to understand um a hidden meaning so he's telling a story here of s of Sarah and Hagar of the flesh the natural and the spiritual there's two covenants and just reading what uh I I just have to keep pointing out how blessed we are that a prophet came because nobody understands what the two covenants represent if you look at what all the denominational World nobody can explain these two covenants they they talk about uh various things but brother random knel it down in God's chosen place of worship one of them was given to Adam on conditioning if you do this and don't do that but that law was broken Adam Eve broke that and in the Garden of Eden then God made the second Covenant and give that to Abraham and that law was unconditional it isn't what you've done or what you will do he said I have already done it as the Bible said all Israel will be saved but that don't mean Jews as Paul said that Israel which is inward or Israel outward outward as we spoke of the other night it was Isaac's children by sex but the law of God was through Christ which was Abraham's royalty that by grace all Israel is saved that's all that's in Christ is sa all God's second Covenant but all these things foreshadowed Christ and when you read the Bible think about how perfect is even the terminology that would say all Israel because Israel ephra represents you and me doesn't say Jew it says Israel for this uh and let's see God's provided place of worship uh paragraph 29 he had a covenant with Adam the first first man on earth and that Covenant was on conditions if you do so and so I'll do so and so but then he made another Covenant and that was with Abraham this Covenant was not on conditions but was unconditionally and then uh next next verse that we're reading verse 25 uh for this AAR is Mount Si in in Arabia and answer to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children Mount Si represents the law and the natural the um appointed for the purpose of of keeping Israel separate a separate people and there they chose to uh to that they wanted to do something for salvation we gone through that before in bondage with their children made slaves of all who sought justification and salvation by their own doings by something they did themselves um and uh in in Acts 15:10 Paul talked about uh why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither Our Father nor we were able to bear that it's it's the law was something that it uh was we couldn't bear it um in verse 26 but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all and this is contrasting the natural and the spiritual that we're above we're Heavenly it's a spiritual not a natural genealogy we're from above has contrasted to the Earthly we're free has contrasted to Hagar the Bond woman and Jerusalem is the mother of us all Jerusalem comes from the word like it was originally called Salem peace because remember the story of melkisedek was the prince of Salem he was Prince of Jerusalem uh Jerusalem uh is kind of a contraction of Jerusalem the the city of peace and uh it's the mother of us all because it's an eternal City and we become uh by being part of Christ we're Eternal so and in the communion 1957 he he said he was called the king of Salem which any scholar knows that Salem was Jerusalem it was called Salem before it was called Jerusalem who was this man that met him that thought that thought he'd taken the right step who was this person that stood by him watch who he is he's the king of Jerusalem and he's also the king of peace and th brother around said notice Jerusalem the word Jerusalem is from above the Bible says it's word is the mother of us all and Christ is our mother we realize that God is our mother for we are born of him the word simply means peace Jerusalem Shalom or Shalom which means peace jerus Shalom see means peace and a Hagar represents um Earthly carnal temporary sah Heavenly spiritual free Eternal in verse 27 for it is written Rejoice thou baren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travail us not for the desolate hath many more children that she with which had and husband this is another verse that uh if God hadn't sent a prophet it it looks like he's saying that Sarah was baring until uh all of a sudden the promise of of many nations is coming to pass but here listen to what really is happening he's quoting Isaiah 54 Where Isaiah said sing Oh Baron thou that do not bear Break Forth into sin and cry aloud thou that do not trevail a child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife said the Lord Brother R said in the spoken word is the Original Seed do you want me you want me to read it all right uh sorry let me step back start at the top Paul was afraid that the people would catch would watch some kind of a big words that he could say some of his education 1 Corinthians 21-8 you want to put it down 1 Corinthians 21 to8 Paul said I never come to you speaking words intellectual you know that your faith might be in some Seminary thing but I come come to you with the Simplicity and the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost that your faith would rest in the word of God although the denominational churches were outnumber the bride a thousand to one do you believe that you believe the Bible teaches it Isaiah 54:1 he promised it for the do you want me you want me to read it all right let's get it you want to see where it's at we promis that they would outnumber sing O bear and thou that this not bear Break Forth into singing and cry aloud thou that do not travail with child for more of the children of the desolate the children of the married wife sayith the Lord more of the children of the than the married wife sure outn us many times though they more in numbers they have no true father now the denominational kinds is interpret is represented in Jude 8813 that's the secular Church clouds Without Rain foaming out their own shame the Pentecostal church is represented of that denominational group in 2 Timothy 3:1 to8 having a form of godliness their seed produced their kind no the unit now we Brethren Let's uh I'm go on verse 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of Promise so a je might read that and say uh or or or we might read that and say how can we be the children of promise that was promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob if the Jews would seems like they would be the promise the natural seed if they despise us and that next verse Paul answers that but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now y because we are and this uh you know Isaac's birth I just have a note Isaac's birth revealed the true character of ishel when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you see God and and when you get a revelation uh then it reveals who who you were where you came from and it also reveals the carnal part of you that's still present it makes it known and uh you know that uh that revelation of the depravity of the flesh can be uh can kind of shock new Believers into thinking that you're you have some uh that you have more troubles than you really it's a good thing to get a revelation of the gravity of the flesh that uh so this is Isaac's when Isaac was born you don't really hear anything about ishma until Isaac was born and then his true character was revealed in verse 30 nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so them brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the three so let's take uh in the last few minutes a closer look at Isaac and where we're going with this Birthright promise so God promised that many nations the promise would come through Isaac but then call on I'm I'm not going to go into details of the sacrifice then he called on Abraham to sacrifice his son the only one that through who the promise that of could be fulfilled and uh you know Isaac just like Jacob when we get to Jacob um you know Jacob had the birth right before he was even born because or he was he was going to get it because God said uh Jacob have I love Esau have I hated if he I believe if he had just waited on it then uh he would have it would have come to him because if you look through the genealogy all of the people through from Isaac down to Manasseh that they were not the first born God gives it to those that desire um and uh the reason Isaac typifies the uh the new birth and the Christ the promised seed is because he was a part of a creative act in Romans 4:19 Paul says that Sarah's womb was dead uh the son of Promise uh he uh just like Christ was raised from the dead and um let see so Abraham the whole walk of uh these three Patriarchs typifies election justification Perfection uh Joseph was Perfection Jacob was Grace um and Abraham uh I just have a note that that they each were represented by kind of something uh that typified their life Abraham what typified his was the Altar and Isaac was the wh and Jacob was tense traveling and ASA Isaac he was always associated with a whale um in in Genesis 2462 the first thing that uh I'll just read it the first thing that said of Isaac after he was bound to The Altar and delivered from uh came came forth um that a lamb was found as a as a sacrifice to offer instead of Isaac the first thing that was said of Isaac after that event was that um in uh Genesis 462 and Isaac came from the well L The Well of him that liveth and seeth me for he dwelt in the South Country that's when he was coming from uh to meet Rebecca and it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son this is verse 11 the next time was um and it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed his son Isaac and Isaac dwelt by the well L The Well of him that liveth and seeth me and Isaac is associated with a well seven times a well of uh a Well Spring of everlasting life The Well of him that live conceive me and uh let's see I have some notes on Abraham Isaac sacrifice so now let's go over to Genesis chapter 22 this is just going over again Isaac Abraham's promise to Isaac after Isaac sacrifice and the angel of the Lord verse 15 Genesis 22:15 the angel of the Lord called into Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because th thou Hast obeyed my voice now let's go over to Genesis so so he's establishing that that he's going to establish him as a uh he's going to give his seed as all the in all the nations of the earth let's go to Genesis 24 verse 60 and this promises established again and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy SE possess the Gate of those which keep them and this is uh possessing the gates go around preach the sermon possessing the gates for enemies this is kind of the the uh National characteristic of the birthright people that they would uh let's see what brother said about thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy what are we afraid about possess the gates we have God's promise we have his word we have his Holy Spirit the angels are encamped about everything's in order every wall can be took down it's already took down the Son of God goes before us his Banners are waving and there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to be the promise of God death can't stop it the Grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you friends death is conquered for you unbeliever wants you receive it and then uh further down PR paragraph 59 be thanks to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ and his seed shall possess the gates of his enemies possess the Gate of all of his enemies and when he come he possessed every gate the Gate of sickness the Gate of death the Gate of Hell the Gate of Temptation the Gate of the Grave he possessed every gra every gate and freely gives it to us and makes us more than conquerors through him that loved us and gave himself for us and then in Genesis 26 I'll stop on this the promise confirmed again to Isaac 261 and there was a fam famine in the land besides beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto ailec King of the Philistines unto guar and guar is the city right on the border line and the Lord appeared unto him and said go now go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of ser Ser journ in this land and I will be with thee because Israel is never blessed that they're out of their place and Will Bless thee For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the oath which I swear unto Abram thy father and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of Heaven as that's us the spiritual and will give unto thy seed all these countries and thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my Commandments my statutes and my laws so um that's just a summary of of the birth right when you think of the birth right you just want to summon up it's you and me am all right God bless y'all good job
