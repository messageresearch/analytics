«  172       †          But the real, ordained of God, that real gene, that real germ, a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world; remember, you that's really got the Spirit of God in you tonight, you were here in Christ because He was the fulness of the Word. He was the fulness of the Godhead bodily. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself. Do you believe that? Look, He was in Christ. Then if you were in God, a gene, a word, a attribute from the beginning, then you walked with Him here on earth, you talked with Him on earth, you suffered with Him on earth, you died with Him at Calvary, and you rose with Him again; and now you're setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, communing with Him (the Word) as It feeds into your soul, that, "Man shall live by ever Word that proceedeth."

«  E-46       †        Oh, what Pentecost needs is a good Bible lesson, good teaching; then you wouldn't need so much going on. See? Jesus Christ was the Son of God. He had the Spirit without measure. You believe that? In Him never dwelt just a part of God, but all of God was in His Son Christ Jesus. He was the Fulness of the Godhead bodily. All of God was poured out in Christ. All that God was was in Christ. And all that Christ is, He poured out on the Church. But you keep refusing it. See? The things that... "If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not. And as the Father has sent Me (How did the Father send Him? The Father sent Him, went with Him and in Him.), so send I you."

«  17       †          So, you see, if you were in the foreknowledge of God, then you are becoming a part of God. And the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God, you had to be a part of God, and God isn't complete without you. Has...

back where we read this morning maybe we'll get our thought from ezekiel 18:4 remember the announcements her brother Joel Forney will be with us this coming Wednesday ministering for us then remember the Bible study will be the August the 2nd first Saturday in and I mean it's September the 2nd then the fellowship meeting will be on the the 9/16 I'm trying to get all these down in the right order and remember that brother Borland will be ministry and pray for those that are traveling today member terence releasing them coming back in from vacation and Wade and June is in Oklahoma so remember them and just keep him in mind Lord may it was good to see freedom back then I stopped right in front of her so you names leave me good I looked at her I thought I'd walk you know piranha right I'll say hi we go way back I couldn't kid with everybody else like that but I can kid LaFrieda ok good to see you alright I've got a question started so if any of you have questions I'm not just say we'll do it but if we get enough questions we will take next Sunday morning ask questions and answer so if you get any questions about what I'm talking about you know just write them out hand them to me and we'll try to cover them in a service or something if we get enough it don't I'll just stick into one question and try to answer that ok anybody anything else I write my own self notes no I can't read them because I got so many but just great the Lord would bless father we thank you for this day and you're Greyson to us thank you for all things and we ask you to just bless and guide each one of us and got us into your truth because that is our desire Lord more than anything else is to be able to walk in the light of your love and father just forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and their push to walk in you we love you and we thank you bless those that are not here those that are traveling those that are sick among us you promised your word and we believe you and we thank you just have your way now with each one of us and guide us and keep us in Jesus name Amen John 1 then we'll go to Ezekiel 18 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God now that's not two or three persons right that's one person being described but he's describing a downward trend of the way he's coming because he's coming from this great existing one alone coming downward to the word coming on down so yeah and that's why it's covering it like it all right but now look what's this person all things were made by him it's a wonderful person in it and without him was not anything made that was made okay in him was life and the life was the light of men and lights on earth and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not okay because there's no way that darkness can understand light it's too much come true one to the other okay ezekiel 18:4 behold all souls are mine now I don't matter hemming - they are anything you want to claim at this out of the other so you need to get it in line and not say the devil can do this and the devil can do that remember the devil cannot create alright so he said all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that's in the it's he'll die you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word got to have brother Raphael and his wife with us always call him Pancho I never could remember his name I'm barely getting it in Raphael I hope it's getting close anyway so at least he knows who he is but now we were trying to I wanted to try to back up a little bit and then move on into the thought for this afternoon but what was our thought this morning trying for quite a while to get you to see that just because you say you have quotes for things and all this that and the other those you got scriptures if it doesn't line up Illustrated this morning that and I love that thought that the Prophet said ever prophet in the Bible had to line up his thoughts with the prophets before him now isn't that something that we could take a book of 66 books you know how many authors and all that we could take and it line up and make a beautiful perfect Word of God well the but brother Dale there's contradictions here well I want you to show me one I've said that before and I want to see it I'd like to find the contradictions you know but see it's not dark because if you line up everyone with the other one then there's no way that that Moses could describe God but then Abraham described a different God right you get the point that all of it must line up then if we believe that we're in the end time and the life's profit to the Gentile dispensation has come and brought his message then it would have to line up ever scripture we have to line up to that message and bring out the same God that each prophet prior to him was trying to bring out and bring it into view to where we could understand to me that makes the Word of God being perfect now let's see what is the word we have the perfect interpretation by divine vindication is that the wording I believe that is true perfect vindication you know in other words God came down in the last days and vindicated the prophets message to be right that's what you say well why do you read a King James Version I have other versions I of all kind I've got one books got 26 translations in it you know covering all of the Bibles and the thing that's been written but I still read this but I'll go back and check things on the others to make sure they all line up to see what they're bringing let's see this King James Version is the one the Prophet read from and it was vindicated so I don't need other versions and other ideas yet I read them but I don't need them because I believe it now you say what are you you got the King guy you believe that's perfect I believe this is perfect this can be your prophet said it was right even that the engine in the bus was in the right place so that's pretty good tops huh yeah but you just think you're just too much sold I don't know brand amount well it might be it may be to that point but I'm sold out on one time I'm sold out on the Word of God it's right and as we're trying to illustrate this morning we used to think Matthew 28:19 contradicted acts 2:38 he becomes you know well then we come up with the greater thoughts and we thought we had it figured out and we came up with the ideas well that that's that's so that's good but so that I've heard people say it this way said the denomination to take Matthew 28:19 that said we take no acts 2:38 no I don't agree with that if we're denominations to Matthew 28:19 they would have to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're greedy because that's what it say it it's not saying two things all right it's saying one thing but it takes two understanding or two thoughts to come together to understand that all right talking this morning worth it Jesus said in John there he said you haven't chosen me but I chose you and ordained you to go forth no no none watch what he said he said you didn't choose me he said I chose you and ordained you but then we go over to Paul in Ephesians and Paul said that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world now is that a contradiction we were chosen in him before the foundation world when he turned around and said you didn't choose me I chose you well did he choose us like picking out I'll take this one I won't take this one for some reason has he picked you no no no we don't believe that way we don't believe that he was picking and choosing well the way it sounds that he said right he said I chose you you see what I'm trying to get you to see was this morning Paul had the revelation of what Jesus said jesus said you didn't choose me I chose you the Paul comes along and said we were chosen in him it didn't Paul doesn't say we were chosen by him he said we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world well he's that contradictory or is it the truth huh see then I tried to bring it to a point and I'll bring this and then move on so then did did God in the beginning before anything did he choose you he said yeah he chokes me did he why did he choose him what was the way that he used to make the point right and that's what I'm saying then what's the point the point that will not be contrary nowhere in the Word of God because this contrary one is not comparing to the other you get the reason that leg the background with a prophets had to line it all up you can't say acts 2:38 is contrary to Matthew 28:19 you've got to say they're saying the same thing so that it can't be then watch the point it's not correct in scripture its correcting our ideas when are we gonna get to the point I've been around the wild and faced a lot in this message but I want you to think just a minute the people of this message are the worst mixed-up people that they are anymore ain't no Baptist shirts messed up like the people of this nation I don't mind saying that cuz you got all these doctrines and ideas from one message what do you mean in that the message brings a whole lot of thoughts and ideas they weaken each one take her own then it cannot be comparing with the rest of the Word of God mehran so then they must be something wrong with the thoughts and the ideas if they don't all come out to bring forth the one understanding then that's not the gospel the prophet brought that's that's just me you know that's the way I see things I see the Word of God is perfect in an order and why can't we get the basis of saying what the word says without trying to figure it out that's my whole point why do we have to figure out like I know he said that but I think that's why you've gotten fifteen or eighteen hundred different denominations today used to be 969 now it's probably two or three times that in about 2000 in this message because they're still trying to figure out what's saying instead of reading what the Prophet says and believe in it yeah waiting for the Holy Spirit to reveal it right but believing it and said thank you see we don't have no problem with the world out here you pick up a newspaper and people to read it and see one you're gonna emphasize a little more on one point or the other but if everybody in you read a newspaper today or one message part you would have basically the same thoughts but how come it is so many people can read the Bible and everybody's got a different thought and then they got the little comeback you know that's your way of seeing this is the way I see it but when that been something wouldn't it have been something for John the Baptist just stepped out to her we know his job was to introduce the Messiah right no we know the Old Testament I'm quoting brother Branham right the Old Testament gave birth those prophets built the body of Jesus Christ when he stood over there in Hebrews 10 5 that a body dies for father I mean it was those prophets words take out one of the prophets you would have had an incomplete body of Jesus Christ standing on earth am i quoting brother Brad I mean he said the prophets built the body and he said John come to be the head of that point to introduce the head we know but he was a head at that point well what if he to introduce Caiaphas do you follow him I thought I'm just trying to make a carnal talk to you to hit a spiritual revelation the Bible's not written that away it's written to bring forth the revelation the one true and living God many many authors but all of them completely compare to each other then you have a message brought to us in the in town that was supposed to who my understanding of what he said it was to pick up all the loose ends right and put it all together and then bring the revelation to take us to the change of the body that's what I thought was the message but that way said it don't give us each one some doubt of her own well that's the way you see it I see it this way a man if they no contradiction to that but I've always made this statement and me remembers it you can't start out in Genesis with a white dog anybody won't finish that one most who would know the answer right brother colleagues were in and he'd probably tell you you can't start out with a white dog in Genesis and you wind up in Revelations with a black dog you changed some work it wouldn't even be that you could wind up in the book of Revelation with a black and white dog you've missed it some work see that's what I see about the message the people are missing well you just think you've got the answer no I don't think I'll have all the answers but there's one thing about it I know where the book is I know what the Prophet says about it so then why not just stay with that part like that and just believe that until it comes forth I was expressing want to go to a brother see when you see something then it opens and it'll stop opening are you with me you see things elope up and it'll just stop well don't get all excited and go haywire try to find you another book or another prophet just wait and just keep studying right there where you're at you already seen my old Daniel 70 weeks book Hey and come out I'd put it a line on it I put a question mark that meant I didn't understand that meant something cut off well then I'd go back and read it again maybe a year later you know mark out that question mark because I could see it I would never preach on the 70 weeks of Daniel that's why I stand today with it maybe you out there whatever you do come show me what's wrong what I've tried to teach you on it I'm saying open as you see I would never preach it deliver mark was out why because I knew if there's a question things are not right you got a question about something you can't be settled so you got to wait until it's revealed but once it's revealed you don't worry about nothing well because it's up to him all right trying to explain one God till trying to preach on one God after 50 years but seeing it open more every day as we travel alone I could go back with you through the messages for 40 years and show you where he's just been a constant unfolding yeah I'll show you where it would stop and then where to start again well because it's the Word of God all right I don't mind telling you I don't have the answers to everything but I did kind of kind of phrase years ago brother Larry can well remember this in the old days and learn the sixties you know in early seventies and they'd say beware of him that's got all the answers yeah he's smart he's intellect so I said ok you calling that phrase Alcon this one we were on the feller that don't have any answers could I fear him more if you don't have any answers I fear him a whole lot more they not do with all these ideas at least he's moving in doing something all right see then that leaves that to worry you can follow it and understand toward us say in this morning we talked about picking and choosing and we get it all messed up but did you catch the thought I was bringing this morning then we'll continue him you know that God didn't choose you he did if he chose you want to choose he I mean you're on the other end of it right if he chose you tell me why I chose you he said yeah because I know this I know Paul said you can know all the mysteries and he'll not charity you're a sound and Bryce and the tinkling cymbal is that right so if you're gonna say God chose me give me the reason he chose you but yet you got scripture said you didn't choose me I told you but did he choose you did you choose your children did you choose your children you know where today when you can do that you've got your your way of putting the eggs and sperm two things together we're in the days when you can actually choose but you still got a problem because even with that and just scientifically saying it it's not just one per one that you implant to try to get it's a mini player one or twos or threes you said what are you talking about you never chose your children you could take a DNA and prove who they belong to which you never chose them you had them God never chose you if you have eternal life he never chose you you are him we gave him this morning we run around and says that we were a part of God well then what does it mean to be a part of God you see where scripture gets involved and you could go six months this rolling I can write now in Scripture you realize from what I was saying this morning that God never chose you he didn't have to choose you were his child if you have eternal life you're part of him is that simple if you have eternal life the eternal life was part of him then did he choose you did he have laid out before him a great multitude of people and he could choose one no that's why I like what Paul said all doesn't go contrary Paul said we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world all is that scripture Paul was explaining what Jesus said but putting it in a revelation where you could understand God never set up before the world and said there's a whole bunch of people I'll pick me a few here I'll bet no it's where Paul Don Marzio said we are his offspring you remain you realize that God's children or a part of him he's not that God had a son that didn't even write to come forth with Jesus Christ God never had a son he was the son he became the son Jesus is not a son of God as a separate person is he he's the same person in another form simple language right so then did God choose you or was you chosen in him if he's chosen in him then now I say it over and over cuz I want it straight in the tunel life you have right now by the new birth was a part of God before the world just as eternal as God he is in brother Branham said what God is not complete without you hey brother sales must be getting something new started I've been teaching this 47 years trying to get somebody to believe it still trying to figure out all this I always was eternal one way and say that one ain't worried about it I'm concerned we're trying to see one time if I can find it in God's Word I don't have to worry about anything else we see we look at the fact and we try to figure out they here's God and here's the Sun and here's a Holy Spirit we had that Great Trinity figured out didn't we we'll come find out it didn't work all God was he poured into Christ right did that do away with God did that leave him any less God no he just changed his form and moved over into as we called it a son getting this ready for next week maybe or you could call him a son is the Holy Ghost another person or is he the same God made manifest in another form well if God is in you who are you he said we don't take scriptures in think when Jesus at his resurrection Jesus in his resurrection he made an outstanding statement he said I go to my father and your father he said I go to my god and your God that sounds like to me that he's trying to explain that we're the children of God by being the children of God then him being in us is what makes us a child him being in us and what makes us a child okay and if you ever was a part of God you always will be the part of God the reasoning use parties because none of us can have it in its fullness right but now if the Godhead and all is not if God's not complete without us then you have to put all of us together to make him complete right and as I said if you left one prophet out of the Old Testament Oh child you have an incomplete body if you leave one person who's a part of the body of Jesus Christ if one person left out you've got an incomplete body trying to express something god I'm trying to get you to see something I've preached for months and months okay see he was kind of hard back there a few months ago you remember somebody don't when I was trying to express before the eternal but brother Brennan said in the beginning before the eternal and how that God was and what was all do you ask most people say well what was God before any of all this well he's just a spirit he was just floating around he just just a floating right according to the Prophet he never was just a spirit by the way he said he's a being he's a person so before the world ever begun he stood there as a person the person yeah but I just can't see him as being real back there how come why what's the purpose you mean to tell me that what whoever whatever that is that he was is not greater than we are come on that's pretty hard in it but you know something had to bring that into being I'm trying to get you to a point maybe that you might see according to Joel where were you in the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy its back before the foundation of the world let me say it this way and then let's see if you follow it then there was never a time that God dwelt alone oh yeah I believe it no you're not getting the point there's never a time that he dwelt alone because the always had his attributes if you have eternal life you was back there before this world ever started and if you don't have eternal life he wasn't back there solved the problem but if you have eternal life eternal life you have what's before the world see we're just looking at life we're not looking at as I said that Jesus would say I go to my father in your father we're not looking at the scripture that says there were errors no errors ACRs eres billing my southern parts bad on them hairs and join errors soon heirs with Jesus Christ and Almighty God at the same time they were joint iron where heirs of God and joint iron I thought joint irons meant everybody had the same thing all together as one I thought the body of Christ everybody was one body we never existed back there is some kind of little people running around that's y'all witnesses and things like that but we have established one thing for certain at least four enough for me to know if you have eternal life today you had any ternal life then I solved with me that's you can argue the point and if you were a part of God then you know what how long was it taking place in eternity and we proved by your profit there's when the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy that that was back in eternity we proved by the Prophet that the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world was written before the world back in eternity we think was written after we got here he said well how can you prove it because of what your prophets then he said when those morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy he said could it have been when the book of life come into view he said they saw the plan of salvation but you don't remember it right there's no way for us to remember it because it was removed from I remember sister but you will you agree to this point anybody that ever I guess eternal life as a child of God had to be a part of gone back to her will you agree that way I mean see that if you agree that way you can see that it never was a time that we look at God as he just nothing he's just walking around ain't got no might talk to you got a mighty fellowship with see that's why I love the word when are we gonna read the word and get it right in the morning start saying to get her sons of God shouted for joy that tells you before this world ever begun that God had his plan and his purpose and he was going to have a family and watch what I'm saying he wasn't going to have a family those terms said get us in their own he had a family can I quote the Prophet he said he was self-existing 1d say that what he said he dwelt alone with his thoughts he said what are you his thoughts brother Dale everybody else is over here trying to tell us how good we are and how we need this now we need to add and you're back talking before the world well put me in the category at least with the old black brother right you remember him when run around first run into it he's in everybody else for the priest you know what happening on earth he said he got the old man up during the old coat you know it said my lord why do you putting that guy by far he too old he said they would tell him to what happened on earth he said here was as men he said he got up fire and said he said where were you or for two mornings huh he said he said you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach city holler with me he said he brought him down the horizontal rainbow now I didn't know there was one did you but brother branham talked about it he enjoyed it well why can't I enjoy but that man saw something and a prophet rejoicing as to what the man was seeing God he saw it see we want to make him God as he nothing and all and then finally he starts coming down before he ever started coming this way he was a whole lot more than we are after we got here so don't worry about it simply trying to get you to see one God so then was it a choosing part or was it the fact that he already had his children all he had to do was wait for a time he could display him on earth any problems with that okay now I won't have time to finish the message but I'll started yeah what were we before the world what were we when a prophet would say in the beginning but before the eternal there's no way to comprehend that statement you gotta just believe it that there was some way that prophet I love it like this lettering said I went to the first heaven right he said Paul went to the third heaven and said Paul the America scripture said he said he saw things he could not speak about Sarah he saw things he couldn't speak about he says not even lawful for me you know now here's me okay I'll just putting my appointment right here okay its mother Dale see there wasn't nobody that I could understand what Paul was talking about you know they said about Einstein they said he had one buddy that could really follow him he said he was an old drunk and hung around with it and the Hans town could communicate with an old drunk with all the rest of the scientists and everything else you know what he wound up and split the atom you know what he done what the rest of them couldn't do the run said I would love to been there to talk to him when he was talking about his finite universe remember that is it what finite or infinite ever each one of the words of you Einstein said you stand and look out and he said with unlimited vision nothing to limit your vision he said you look straight out he said what would you see he said the back of your head unlimited now see the back here head what I love about I understand I'm not a mathematician but I always loved math Einstein's theories were mathematical calculations he put it into action he said in space he said her part he said you could shoot one object to the other object in the fourth dimension and he said he'd go through so fast he'd never leave a hole you want to quote from brother branham there where he said Jesus came back so fast when he was returning to the disciples he said he come back so fast he went right through the wall he never left I understand you a lot he said I'd love to talk to you about those time listen church and as I thought this for a few minutes and then I'll finish it but will in Sunday and you have questions we're a human being to be a human being the fact is that we're not like the animals you know the other animals were created a body and a life spirit whatever you want to call it you know what the human being was created in the image of God I love that and by created in the image of God according to Genesis 1:26 or 27 all right we're we have a body a spirit and a soul that makes us a human being the animal just has the body the spirit part that's why he doesn't change the bird builds a house the same he does everything it doesn't change but the human being this wrote around him said even in his fallen estate and got it laying in here a minute I'll get it he said even in his fault in the state that man is a marvelous creation even in his fallen estate look at the science that you're dealing with today you've got a little overwatch on your own you know what there's computers right computer on that little watch ain't talked about my watch I'm talking about you I'm talking about you can get them watch the computers the size of a watch you see we think we don't listen I love to read I left to read all documentaries or whatever you want to call them you know I read one time in the year 1900 they had watches now you can automatically blow your mind because you're gonna think that the only watch they had you know was these big old time clocks and big old kinds because the watch didn't come on until later on as we come and that thinking about it that little computer can be compressed into that size and then you think about cameras and pictures in 1900 we still looked at pull over the time get you lined up you know lit up the thing right the government had watches in 1900 that could take pictures of you I don't know where I believe that or not well that's alright don't matter that's just making a point some of you are in owning steady things in living you know yourself you military people that anything they tell you your god is obsolete they are not going to tell you you don't read and listen when they went to Kuwait two months or something before they win they tried to get a stealth bomber built they had to photo tops made of stealth bombers to take them into Kuwait two months they told that to the head down the first trip they made to Kuwait you better check it they had 15 you know evidently they didn't tell us all of it you don't never listen to your prophet say and his fifty son 1950 something he said Russia has jet our planes we see most of you that know your history the Germans and things had jets before we did they just didn't know how to handle it brother Ron said they say Russia he's got yet our plane and watch him and flying saucers that's what's your prophecy but we didn't know about flying saucers the first one you check I was about 40 1940 right in there when that poster of Christ and most immense in outer space and all that thing you know that big old place I turned now they still won't let nobody go - what are you getting at I'm getting at one thing if science has advanced as much as it has what do you think they're doing brother Branham says they're breaking into God's laboratory it's unbelievable all right go back to Genesis an imagination of man's heart was continually evil in other words there was nothing that a man thought ever he couldn't do it that's in Genesis before the flood they told him it wouldn't go in rain no they could shoot the Stars and back and prove it but he did now getting a point when are we gonna believe what the Prophet say it without trying to figure it out but just believe it and accept him as being the Prophet and telling us what the Bible says it's all right brother Branham I like that I like to I like to ask brother Brennan questions page 45 I think it is Christ the mystery of God revealed letter Branham what is the new birth he says it there the very wording what is the new birth so he's gonna answer it he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join the church in Atlanta it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well see I like to ask brother Branham question brother Branham from year 63 on through 65 you spend a lot of time talking about eternal life every message he's talking about eternal life every message he's talking about a seed being in you he's saying you always was eternal you weren't born on any certain day how can that be truth letter random what were we then before the world we said we were part of God you've spent a lot of time right I'm glad you remember that we spent a lot of time trying to explain that right they were part of God all right now what part of God do we need to talk about now according to your prophet God is a triune being not a Trinity a triune being and as it makes takes Father Son and Holy Ghost to make you a person it takes Father Son and Holy Ghost to make God a person leave off any one of them he's not a person leave off body you're not complete leave off souls or spirits you're not complete what she didn't that's why we don't have no problem sin and Paul Paul wrote sit one God man we get one day he said the God and Father God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ that's five manifestations right God father of our Lord Jesus Christ you said well you got four words okay we got forward that's enough you know you know what's Paul ever talking about a Trinity he didn't believe in it did he he was the guy that was real good instrumental in doing away with it did brother Branham ever believe in the Trinity how would you like a quote where he said let's stand together and address a third person of the Trinity the direct quote was he ever a Trinity of anyway Danny no no we never treated him well why would he do that cuz he talking about your person you're not done by himself he knew he believed he said let's address your person you won't address the second or third person of the Trinity and let's talk about him a little bit he was never a Trinitarian he was right till we go to him and say brother branham we've concluded by your statements that if there's any way we could be back dire we would have to be a part of God if we have eternal life it means that eternal life that you have is a part of God what about it what part of God are we what part of God was before the foundation of the world that we are a part of to make us to make heaven comes with it so let's read him in city go ahead brothers pick up number one we'll get started I'll just go so far and quit try to get the point to you this is from the message the God who is rich in mercy I got 44 or 45 45 46 now listen to what he says and I love it I'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out you don't have to mix up doctrine it comes already mixed right my wife says get self-rising I was thinking what the difference in self-rising and in the regular kind which he explained one day that self-rising meant there was something in it to make it rise well you know I understand that night on so you don't have to go over every day and try to explain to me what she needs a certain kind of meal for you gets ready to do the communion she said go get me the plain meal my work my work not cornmeal okay but listen he said I don't do this to mix-up doctor well just straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare deer and scare what are you afraid of the biggest fear of human element can have is the fear of the fact you don't know whether he's saved or not he's not the Boogerman hollering boo it's not all other things it's whether or not you saved at least now let me put it in my languages none there at least that ought to be the biggest fear the biggest fear that we could ever have or to be are we born again or not and to see it line up in the correct way you'll see he takes away that fear and he shows you who you are get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are come on I'll come through the Baptist or not listen to it through this message people and we Baptist to get up and say I believe I'm saved a hope and saved I know I'm saved I don't know him say I believe I am I don't know you ain't never been in the Baptist had preached you one sermon one week there's none good no not one and he drive everybody to hell and in the next Sunday priest be ye therefore perfect and send everybody to heaven you didn't listen in like you don't listen now but you don't know who you are if you knew who you are you wouldn't be afraid now look you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God you always were the sons of God you don't need to bring these things out call it skiers us okay you catch my point it scares us go we need an answer I wasn't afraid before now the Prophet told me I don't know who I am and he says but you are the sons of God you always were the sons of God now isolate that what do you got you got you coming in the world with eternal life you got your thoughts that I don't have to worry about a thing cause always was he turned but when you read then and the Prophet will say you begin eternal life right here to alter don't you tell me I will not even entertain the thought that you don't fall back on but I thought always was now he's saying I'll get it down here don't tell me you don't do that I'm a human and do the same thing okay listen how is it that you always were son of God but the fact that you have a life of Almighty God living within you right now that way you always were a son of God if you're a part of God and that part of God is eternal life you always was a son you just blowing my mind why wouldn't you want to find out a few answers then are you satisfied with your mind going blown and forget it help yourself look you always were sons of God if you're a part of God and was back there you're a son of God if you don't have the new birth you wouldn't back that so you're not a son of God see everybody is the son of God by creation right by physical creation of mankind ever person in the world is the son of God it's not a son of the devil didn't create the only way a human being can be and to come into being is a fact that God created you they don't matter whether you ever get saved or not you were a son of God by natural creation we've got to get the spiritual part run look for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you I didn't make up the word him some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there you know what old man well when he before he even become my Tyrael here on earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knows what your name would be he knowed the color of your higher you would have you know all about you the only thing happened this wind your your being a sinner you come into the world are you reading them some part of you if you're going to read what I don't believe that would then you're saying you don't live what'd he say it right so just go ahead and play it's not but if you listen to what he said he said some part of you what part of you look you're next this is who is this Melchizedek he's talking about in this thinking before there was an angel stars arab emirate anything that's eternal and if you have eternal life you always was and wants you not your being here but to shape and form of the infinite god who is not our being here get all this out of the way it's to shape and form of the infinite God because he's the only one that ever was he time look at number three questions and answers on Genesis now the first man he made the first man in His image and we're returning back to that image that's right to our first created image then is what he said when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world like I said we brother Branham yea we believe brother Brandon four to five days work but when he gets down here to arm and Neville and the rest of us are we gonna believe that I believe brother Brandon was back there he's a prophet he making God a respecter of persons you know making him like - when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious if anything as far as I know of I don't die on that he just made a spirit no we're gonna find out the spirit can't die so you got a problem okay so I said don't die on that one he said he made my being my spare another words he made me he made my life not just a second realm that's the part of it he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know uh but the I was dire oh I don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world again come on that's John and Jesus that I chose you you didn't choose me that's the two scriptures I've been quoting John and evasions what now there was some part of me Armand Neville and you know he ain't our man elbow so he wasn't saying it that what he was saying there was some part of me it's some part of our man Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world then he describes what happened to us when he got here you know the story of that when we got here those angels brought us a nature the good angels are the ones that are signed to the children of God the other angels they give you a bad nature so you know what he's talking about the analysis what are you listening to evidently according to these couple of statements there was some part of us back before the world and what is it some part of us I didn't make this statement he did so I guess what we need to do is rip that an out cause it ain't right the other way well later why lost like another one you just rip out an out and throw it away you've got to deal with it and I'm the guy that's supposed to be dealing with it in the basis of being a pastor I'm supposed to be trying my best to save your soul Tory gets to be a burden but it ain't no burden to it there ain't no burden to being a preacher sure I get down and out run around get so down and out because it's hard to try to explain to people when they won't listen but a random said there was part of him before the world he said there was a part of our man devil before the world he said that's a part of you before the world now what is it waiting number four the Easter seal there's only one life one eternal spirit when he turned a life and that's God that's God God alone is the eternal and then we being his children are part of him how much plainer can we get what is his children that is the attributes of his thinking this is children and the thought is expressed and becomes a word then each individual in here that possesses this eternal life that's not everybody sitting there right come on read it the ones who possess eternal life in each individual in here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in God's thinking it's the only way it could be because you're an attribute he said what we were just in his thinking who talked to you what I believe I don't want to be a part of his thinking because that thought of Judas but if I'm part of the thinker then I mean he's thinking no everybody in the world was in he's thinking that's an expression of a thought has become a word and the word has taken life in this eternal that's the reason we have eternal life in the same principle that the great son of God the Redeemer we have eternal life the same way he had he turned life the Redeemer we become sons and daughters of God through the same spirit by the same foreknowledge of God they were way back behind full knowledge we're back into him and being part of him and not just being somebody thought of I'll read this one but then we'll stop on the next okay go ahead to number five we read this one and I'll quit Christ is revealed in his own word now the same thing is this if see that's why I love brother Branham the way here you'll say if you have eternal life you always was eternal if you're a son of God it's that stuff do you mean it's not him designating who's what if you are a son of God and if I am a son of God her daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him what germ form what his journal word when he was crucified he was crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now since we've recognized it now we're sick getting together with him in heaven we're sat together with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus II where he we if we are sons and daughters of God we are God's children and we are attributes of God then we were God eternal life and God is the only eternal out that there is then we were in him from the beginning in when Jesus become all that word then we were part of him then amen there you are when that's in dire there's no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the top post those are so you can be anointed out here in this spirit and desire and do all these other things but when it comes down to this top pose to that word you'll never move from there it'll hold right steady and truth to that word as it can be outside of that regardless of what you do you're still lost okay where's no brother Dale you didn't answer the question what part are we well we were before the foundation of the world it's Paul Harvey said we'll take it up page 2 you know that Paul Harvey he'd bring news more than you'd say and now that's page 2 in other words he's gonna start over once knock me out so you going out to come next Sunday no brother for when he called me priest Wednesday you get the rest of the story you're gonna have to come next Sunday oh no I said that cuz they're like gonna be missing well that's verse not dirty in I didn't mean it they're just gonna be a lot missing next Sunday they already told me there was okay but listen I hope you understand one time I do not believe that we as human elements come into the world with eternal life no were within us whatsoever I don't believe that I believe you've got to get going to receive eternal life you got to be born again to receive eternal life and you better remember that thought I was making there's gonna be a lot of people at the white throne judgment be given eternal life that don't make them a part of the body of Christ then I wish you would think just for a minute what a little second the Old Testament Saints is jehovah's bride right they don't have eternal life Jesus Christ had died we got to add him to deal with that's the easy to deal with it because the way he started him off no problem but none of the Old Testament Saints that's why they had to go to paradise and wait and Jesus Christ could come to paradise and pick him up put him into a wonderful position would not take him to the presence of Almighty God they didn't have eternal life back there those great ones those great prophets they didn't have eternal life dwelling within them the great John the Baptist he said buddy wait a minute she's gonna be careful John I'm very careful with John John received eternal life in the mother's wound if you want to call it that if you want to go with that but you better be careful how you go with it because he would have been an impartation John the Baptist never went through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost do you become a child of God am i right I'm just asking you to be sensible so if that's not true then all of those Old Testament Saints according to Hebrews 11:40 they're waiting on you and I to come to a place so is all of the people down through the church ages their way to go in you and I to reach a place so where's the foolish virgins being connected with you but of the situation's it's always the fields you so with everything hinged upon whether or not we are his children you realize what I'm saying old testament job was right New Testament is the children of God foolish virgins and rest them they're not the children I'm gone you tell me they are where you gonna get it the children of God is that group of people on the day of Pentecost to the rapture of the church that's the ones I'm talking about that were a part of God before the world ever begun they are his offspring they're his children that's why he would say I go to my father and your father he said I go to my god and your God there's a special group of people in that middle part called the bride of Jesus Christ what a wonderful opportunity for you and I to be able to be a part of that did you follow me Old Testament Saints they're not too bright as Jesus Christ they rejected that right foolish virgins and people after they're not Bride of Christ it's only the group that's in the middle that is his bride and who do you think he come to get do you know it right around said only the predestinate is considered in Redemption the Old Testament Saints are going to be given the foolish virgins and the 144,000 and their fields you they're going to be given but they don't get eternal life here and like I'm part of the bride what a wonderful opportunity the children of God has to know and realize that we are his children we are his offspring we're all born kinfolks to the devil right but the new birth makes us kinfolks to God see we're going to prove what we are come on musician we're going to prove what we are what a wonderful opportunity it is to know the truth I'd rather be humanly speaking we just keep trying one of these days we're gonna realize the Bible is right it even tells us what I think of that one today he said we don't know what kind of a body will have right they said we'll have a glorious body like unto his body how many of us back in the denominations and like what we heard of this message would have ever made a statement that Jesus his body had to be redeemed and many people in the message even know that his body was not eternal it was created in the big created it had a beginning it had to be made eternal in the resurrection his body that did not to be redeemed caught it was a sinner it had to be redeemed because it had a beginning think on these things okay let's stand together what a mighty God we serve we appreciate these children the singing and worshipping they done today the little ones up we'll enjoy them [Music] we serve anybody have a need why would your prophet say the most important thing in your life is whether you're born in our [Music] never stop seeking God [Music] sir what am I angels Bobby you have another what [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what am I [Music] [Music] what a mighty God [Music] [Music] many many many years just let everything into your anal and just get away from all kind of feelings and ideas and rest in you and say thank you we love you Lord and just come Lord and make it matter better let your love and grace be with our sister for me we love you we thank you we believe just keep believing they keep confessing when everything goes wrong thank you lord is that right I wish both to rejoice when everybody rejoined that's good that's easy but what about rejoicing and everybody else is down now [Music] he's never a day I walked up to the house at night some down to three times and not and I never I'm not a prior warrior I just never been made that way but there's not a day that I don't thank him for saving me not a day that I don't thank him for what he's done for me [Music] there's not a day that I don't call it my father [Music] I talk doing like a daddy I never had a daddy daddy died well then it's four years old I never had somebody I could go to but I have a father that I can go to and you don't want a lot of times I just sat down on the couch and I don't say a time and not just sector and I'll get up say Lord thank you for saving me thank you for this thank you for touching my wife's he's got a lot of trouble with her aunt thank you brother sister so and so you know whatever and go crawl right back into bed I'm not a big prior warrior that can pray hours at a time I believe in that they are prayer warriors that were suing children for that I was chosen to be one if you tell me the truth I want to believe it I want to believe you tell me what God said I believe [Music] our little buddy's got problems in his body we know who the god we know this little fella you don't understand what yet we're contacting you and we're bringing him right before you thrown to your grace and your love Lord you reach down you touch and everybody you take away all these sicknesses of ninety because we believe that by your stripes he's healed in Jesus none just believe it anybody upset have a need [Music] thank you heaven you know what I love to read God's Word and think about it meditate I don't read this farce a lot of things I'll sit down and read and I'll study and read the message but you know you just think about how real God is see think it's wonderful the more real do you think about how he is now wonderful he is but what he's done for me and you he gave his own life that you and I could live all he's wanting us to do today is live to where that our lives can make him manifest to the world I take you see Christ why don't we want to live it that way and just commit everything into his hands believe it accept it no would it be bad or good well I can accept it when it's good but it's hard to accept what you want but a random said I know from God it's greater than anything you could ask him only yes if it wouldn't regard to tell you you know I ain't gonna give you that you're to thanking for praising father because he's going to show you wonderful things like on these things father we thank you for this day and we know that we've tried to make a lot of things and a lot of points but our main point is emphasize you learned what you've done for us we are your children we are the sons and daughters of a living God and we thank you for our Lord and just helpless because we see the ire of it it's not based on anything we could do or not doing or this based on what you've already done we thank you go with us on the way home give everybody a safe journey you know all of these that are traveling at different times Lord let your love be made manifest in our hearts and lives in Jesus name you just means [Music]
