[2:02] that i'm not long-winded because i've
[2:03] been coming long-winded
[2:05] but not not like some but uh and this
[2:08] and this uh message this morning uh it
[2:12] in a roundabout way it's a father's day
[2:14] message uh
[2:15] i was i was meditating on on what the
[2:18] lord would be pleased for me to bring
[2:21] and it just seemed like it kept rolling
[2:23] back to
[2:24] a series that i had just got done with
[2:26] at home
[2:27] uh and i entitled the series the dragon
[2:29] slayers
[2:31] today they want to train a dragon but
[2:34] the bride of christ
[2:36] destroys the dragon amen we train we
[2:39] train the dragon to be in the bottomless
[2:41] pit for a thousand years that's how this
[2:43] works
[2:44] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[2:46] at the end
[2:48] and the death of a star
[2:52] those are the titles that i give the
[2:53] message at home and the last one is
[2:56] the war in heaven was not with sticks
[2:59] and stones
[3:00] it was not with swords and knives and
[3:02] guns and balls and
[3:04] chains it was with words
[3:07] so if you would take your bible and turn
[3:09] with me to revelations chapter 12.
[3:11] we'll just get rolling this morning if
[3:13] we could uh brother samuel
[3:16] didn't have any idea what i was going to
[3:18] bring and what was in my notes but boy
[3:20] we were talking about these things last
[3:21] night brother samuel
[3:23] he's just opened up and i tried to be as
[3:25] quiet as i could
[3:26] uh because we were talking about uh
[3:28] judgment we were talking about
[3:31] angels we were talking about the
[3:33] judgment seat of christ and
[3:35] and lo and behold this morning that's
[3:36] not part of the message
[3:38] when you've got revelations 12 say amen
[3:42] we'll just start reading from verse one
[3:43] you know you could read the whole
[3:45] chapter
[3:46] and we'll read bits and pieces of it
[3:47] throughout the message but let's start
[3:49] with verse one and there appeared a
[3:50] great wonder in heaven
[3:51] a woman clothed with the sun and the
[3:53] moon under her feet
[3:55] and upon her head a crown of twelve
[3:58] stars
[3:59] and she being with child cried
[4:02] travailing in birth
[4:03] and pained to be delivered
[4:06] and there appeared another wonder in
[4:09] heaven
[4:11] and behold a great read the copycat
[4:14] a great and behold a great red dragon
[4:17] having seven heads and ten horns and
[4:20] seven crowns upon his heads and his
[4:24] tail drew the third part of the stars of
[4:27] heaven
[4:28] and it cast them to the earth and the
[4:30] dragon stood before the woman which was
[4:33] ready to be delivered for to devour her
[4:35] child
[4:36] as soon as it was born and she brought
[4:39] forth a man-child
[4:41] who was to rule all nations with a rod
[4:43] of iron and her child was caught up
[4:45] unto god and to his throne and the woman
[4:48] fled into the wilderness where she hath
[4:51] a place prepared of god
[4:52] that they should feed her there a
[4:55] thousand
[4:56] two hundred and three score days and
[4:58] that is how long
[5:00] that's three and a half years if you use
[5:02] the jewish calendar
[5:03] and there was war in heaven
[5:08] michael and his angels fought against
[5:11] the dragon
[5:13] and the dragon fought and his angels
[5:16] you know why it says it like that
[5:18] because his angels fight amongst one
[5:19] another also
[5:21] and prevailed not neither was their
[5:24] place
[5:24] found anymore in heaven and the great
[5:27] dragon was cast out that old serpent
[5:30] called the devil and satan
[5:31] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[5:34] cast
[5:34] out into the earth and his angels were
[5:37] cast out with him
[5:38] and i heard a voice a loud voice saying
[5:41] in heaven
[5:42] now is come salvation and strength and
[5:45] the kingdom of our god
[5:47] and the power of his christ for the
[5:50] accuser of our brethren is cast
[5:52] down which accused them before our god
[5:55] day and night let's pray father
[5:58] we're so thankful lord for the reading
[6:00] of your word and we're asking now father
[6:02] as you had
[6:03] given it to us under inspiration that
[6:05] you would permit it father to flow
[6:07] out this morning lord from my mouth use
[6:11] this vessel lord i pray to speak to your
[6:14] children lord and
[6:15] all that will listen let it be your word
[6:18] and
[6:18] only your word father let it be received
[6:21] unto the inspiration it was given lord
[6:23] for he that hath an ear let him hear
[6:26] what the spirit
[6:27] saith unto the churches we're so
[6:30] thankful
[6:31] we're so grateful we ask for your help
[6:34] and your guidance now
[6:35] in the precious and the lovely and the
[6:37] wonderful name

[6:46] god bless you may be seated
[6:49] it's a like i say it's a real joy to be
[6:51] here with you this morning
[6:53] and uh and i'm just i'm just thankful
[6:56] and thankful so
[6:57] we can see now now i i i got i'm going
[7:00] to tell you where i got the inspiration
[7:02] for this if it's all right
[7:04] i'm going to take my time if that's okay
[7:06] i don't want to put you to sleep but
[7:07] you know uh the the the the world
[7:11] the cosmos and everybody that's living
[7:13] in it and on it
[7:14] uh has sort of been in lockdown now
[7:18] of course we realized that that started
[7:20] at the somewhere near the beginning of
[7:22] of last year
[7:24] what a lot of people don't realize that
[7:26] this thing that they're giving the title
[7:27] coveted and coron coronavis has been
[7:29] around
[7:30] for since the fall did you know that
[7:33] it's not new but what happened was
[7:37] uh people that believed that they had
[7:39] been given the authority and by the way
[7:42] they were unauthorized
[7:45] to break into god's laboratory and to
[7:47] start messing around
[7:48] thought that they could put together
[7:50] something that they could use
[7:52] to control the people now did that work
[7:54] out
[7:56] they almost got it done i mean really
[7:59] they are controlling
[8:00] a lot more people than they were before
[8:03] the virus was let out now
[8:05] when i'm speaking to you this morning i
[8:07] want you to understand i am not
[8:08] demeaning or impugning
[8:10] anybody's faith um of course we lost
[8:13] loved ones due to this catastrophe this
[8:16] plague
[8:17] the the virus and so forth uh because
[8:21] it was uh something that satan of course
[8:24] here
[8:24] uh is is trying to employ
[8:28] to take away the authority of god and
[8:31] his word
[8:32] and i'm going to tell you how he's
[8:33] trying to take that away he's trying to
[8:35] take that away
[8:36] he can't take it from god i think maybe
[8:39] we heard that in bible study this
[8:40] morning
[8:41] can't take it from god but he's
[8:44] trying to destroy the heritage of god
[8:47] the attributes of god the children the
[8:49] brothers and sisters
[8:51] that make up that heritage you see
[8:55] he can't touch god
[8:58] but he thinks he can get us right i got
[9:01] news for him
[9:03] because michael and his angels fought
[9:05] amen
[9:06] now you might say well that was
[9:08] something that happened in heaven
[9:10] well if you'll read your bible you'll
[9:12] find out that that war that started in
[9:15] heaven
[9:15] got thrown down here to the earth
[9:20] which really if you really understand
[9:22] god's word makes it much better
[9:24] yeah it's very difficult to fight an
[9:26] enemy you cannot see
[9:28] amen right amen just like people find it
[9:31] hard to serve a god they cannot see
[9:35] but here we are in the tangible in the
[9:37] three-dimensional
[9:39] and i don't know whether you realize it
[9:41] or not but we're in war
[9:42] yeah this is not a picnic this is not a
[9:45] cake walk
[9:46] there's a young lady at our home church
[9:48] that asked me about getting baptized a
[9:50] few weeks ago
[9:51] so i decided to speak on it last sunday
[9:53] and i said sis
[9:55] i know your desires to get baptized and
[9:57] we're all for you
[9:58] but let me tell you something the war
[10:02] is going to start as soon as you come up
[10:05] out of that water let me tell you this
[10:08] is not a cakewalk this is not a picnic
[10:10] this is a battle but we're equipped
[10:15] for this battle god would not put us
[10:18] out on the battlefield without the tools
[10:22] to implement not just a fight
[10:26] but victory we will be victorious
[10:29] because he is victorious you love him
[10:33] amen
[10:34] so i got this inspiration and i know
[10:37] this sounds strange but i'll just be
[10:38] real honest and blunt
[10:41] while i was at some camp meetings tent
[10:44] meetings i guess you'd say in virginia
[10:46] here a couple months ago brother sean
[10:48] martin put those on
[10:50] and his congregation and they were
[10:51] wonderful i noticed something though
[10:53] that i hadn't noticed in years
[10:56] been many years since i noticed it
[10:58] because people were they were locked
[10:59] down and they were
[11:00] caged up and they were they were they
[11:02] were bound
[11:05] well there was a freedom there that i
[11:07] had not seen
[11:08] in years and and what really got a hold
[11:12] of me was the fact that
[11:14] the lord began to deal with me and speak
[11:16] with me about how that we're in a battle
[11:18] and that he's going to try to keep us
[11:20] captive
[11:22] he's going to try to keep us bound but
[11:25] we know that the message of the hour
[11:26] tells us that
[11:28] he did have the holy spirit can you
[11:30] imagine this now imagine this statement
[11:32] that the devil had the holy spirit bound
[11:36] well the devil really didn't wasn't the
[11:39] one responsible for binding the holy
[11:41] spirit
[11:42] the devil was the one responsible for
[11:44] bringing god's children into bondage
[11:47] and by that he could bind
[11:50] the holy spirit from working
[11:53] amen through god's heritage
[11:57] so god decided it was time
[12:00] and in the 20th century he allowed a man
[12:04] to be born
[12:04] amen and that he was going to use
[12:08] for one purpose and that purpose was
[12:12] to give freedom amen right amen
[12:16] to the heritage of god that man's name
[12:18] was william mariam branham
[12:21] now the the words that we have in our
[12:24] end time message as we call it and as
[12:27] we've come to know it
[12:28] are not the words that's right of
[12:31] william mary and branham
[12:32] amen get that straight right now this
[12:35] morning
[12:36] they are the words of god through
[12:39] the man we do not lift the man up
[12:42] we lift the god in the man up
[12:47] i want you to get that because it's
[12:48] going to become important
[12:50] when you're in battle it's not you
[12:55] doing the fighting god said step aside
[12:59] children right if you believe me i will
[13:02] fight your battles for you and they
[13:06] will be victorious every time
[13:09] but you see you have to have the right
[13:11] attitude
[13:13] in honor of brother ernie villanueva
[13:16] and the thousands of quotes and cliches
[13:21] that came out of his mouth which were
[13:23] wonderful
[13:25] the one that comes to me and stays with
[13:27] me most often
[13:29] is your attitude determines your
[13:32] altitude
[13:34] now we live in the age where
[13:37] we believe in a rapture and we've been
[13:40] given uh the information from god
[13:43] through the prophet that
[13:44] in this age there is a requirement
[13:48] that was not required of any other age
[13:51] and that requirement was rapturing
[13:54] faith it he said it will take greater
[13:56] faith can you imagine
[13:58] we look back at the patriarchs in the
[14:00] old testament beginning
[14:02] with noah and then in the enoch
[14:05] and then and then and then abraham and
[14:08] moses
[14:09] and and and isaiah and you just go down
[14:11] the line and daniel and
[14:13] and the three hebrew children and and
[14:15] the disciples
[14:17] and we say wow man did they have a
[14:22] tremendous amount of faith
[14:25] and they're looking at us today going
[14:27] yeah come on
[14:30] come on you can do it
[14:33] come on because you
[14:37] are causing us listen now
[14:40] to be imperfect
[14:47] because they without us cannot be made
[14:51] perfect
[14:52] do you see the responsibility that lays
[14:55] upon our shoulders brothers and sisters
[14:57] that's why we're not playing church
[15:00] this is not this is not a religious
[15:02] ceremony
[15:05] these are the words of the living god
[15:09] mandated to become manifest in
[15:12] somebody's life
[15:15] why not you amen it could be you this
[15:18] morning
[15:19] you say you don't understand brother i
[15:21] oh i understand i'm in the same battle
[15:23] you're in
[15:24] it's the greatest battle ever fought
[15:28] and the way that i like to say it not to
[15:30] take away from the title that the
[15:32] prophet gave
[15:33] but after you study what he said it's
[15:36] the greatest battle ever
[15:42] because this all took place in the mind
[15:44] of god before the foundation of the
[15:46] world
[15:47] then god decided to condense in
[15:50] from the invisible to the visible
[15:54] and the way he started to do that was he
[15:56] began
[15:58] to emanate himself from a point
[16:01] of light now it's a super
[16:05] natural light the prophet says and
[16:07] questions and answers on genesis
[16:09] that can only be seen with a super
[16:12] natural eye so don't be looking for god
[16:15] through your natural eyes this morning
[16:17] you want to look through a super natural
[16:21] the way you get that eye is you begin
[16:25] to hear the word because the hearing of
[16:29] the word
[16:30] brings about faith and god
[16:33] predicated his entire plan
[16:38] on one entity and that
[16:42] is faith and faith
[16:45] is something for which you believe in
[16:48] listen careful now
[16:50] this goes against everything that we're
[16:53] taught
[16:55] faith is predicated upon
[16:58] belief in something
[17:03] in which there is no proof
[17:08] [Music]
[17:10] can i read something to you
[17:14] i know i got it here you just bear with
[17:17] me
[17:21] in the message power of transformation
[17:24] listen careful 10 31 65
[17:29] paragraph 136 136-7
[17:33] brother branham speaking when i go home
[17:36] this time
[17:39] i want you all to know he never made it
[17:42] to jeffersonville but listen to how he
[17:45] says it
[17:47] when i go home this time i'm preaching
[17:51] on the subject the trail of the serpent
[17:54] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[17:58] at the end and trail him
[18:02] right through the bible and show
[18:05] how he heads up see and you
[18:08] all get that on the telephone
[18:12] you see if the lord permits us to do it
[18:16] and now just watch now how cunning watch
[18:19] how cunning
[18:20] that fellow is how he's just exactly
[18:24] just well
[18:24] they're just like judas and jesus there
[18:28] both brothers in their tribe
[18:32] just like esau and jacob and like the
[18:35] crow
[18:36] and the dove sitting on the same roost
[18:39] and everything is a twin man
[18:43] in in this great warfare
[18:47] that we're in it'd be so close
[18:52] the two spirits would be so close
[18:55] they will look like identical twins
[19:00] and if you're not familiar with
[19:01] identical twins
[19:04] listen close they have the same dna
[19:08] but there is something that separates
[19:11] them
[19:12] you say yeah well one might have a mole
[19:14] or one might have a widow's peak or one
[19:16] might
[19:17] i'm going to tell you that in the human
[19:19] genome project
[19:20] they've discovered what separates
[19:23] an identical twin they have the same
[19:26] exact genetic strengths
[19:30] listen careful but some of them are not
[19:33] lit up in one
[19:37] of the twins
[19:40] i know it sounds strange some of them
[19:43] are darkened they can see the string
[19:46] but watch now there's a gap here there's
[19:49] a gap here
[19:50] there's a gap here and there's a gap
[19:51] here in this long dna string
[19:53] and they are they are dark spots
[19:59] blemishes if you're following me
[20:02] all right listen now amen the enemy
[20:06] uses deception like he did to eve
[20:11] oh god has said
[20:14] oh now it's a quotation
[20:18] surely but surely see see
[20:21] trying to reason it beyond what god
[20:26] said originally
[20:29] and what did he originally say thou
[20:31] shall die
[20:33] see he said yes
[20:36] god said that watch the devil now watch
[20:39] how close it is
[20:42] but surely see that spray
[20:46] over it see but what god
[20:49] says god keeps i like this part
[20:53] he don't need any help from satan
[20:57] because satan's going to try to help it
[20:59] he keeps at sea
[21:00] so don't never be deceived by that now
[21:03] we notice then
[21:04] that it brought forth of its kind now
[21:08] in genesis here we find out after the
[21:10] spraying
[21:12] of this poison of knowledge
[21:17] now science is knowledge
[21:21] you want you want to see modern events
[21:23] made clear by prophecy
[21:24] this was preached in 1965
[21:28] and what is the mantra coming forth
[21:30] right now because of what
[21:32] men have done to this world
[21:36] all we hear is science
[21:40] science science science
[21:44] that's right ain't it the truth come on
[21:48] oh follow the science believe the
[21:50] science
[21:51] did you know that the prophet of god
[21:53] said
[21:54] science is the devil's religion amen
[21:58] absolutely god of this evil age
[22:01] it's nothing but satan trying to figure
[22:06] out listen careful now how to be a
[22:07] creator
[22:09] but because he can't create everything
[22:12] he touches
[22:13] eventually becomes a perversion
[22:16] he misses it somewhere all right
[22:21] the great subject in school
[22:24] science today a better automobile
[22:28] a better this a better home a better
[22:30] house a better this a better that

[22:46] right now that cell phone you got
[22:49] you can't remember your own phone number
[22:51] let alone anybody else's

[22:56] all kinds of stuff area codes and phone

[23:03] now people i say what's your phone
[23:04] number i don't know i got to look it up

[23:12] humanity now i'm not preaching against
[23:16] your gadgets
[23:17] i'm just learning how to use them myself
[23:20] but i want you to understand how the
[23:24] enemy operates because we're in a battle
[23:27] and listen god has called upon a group
[23:30] of
[23:31] people and we happen to live in the day
[23:34] when that group of people exist
[23:36] to slay the dragon
[23:40] that's our responsibility and by the end
[23:43] of this morning's message we'll find out
[23:45] how
[23:46] it is to be done amen
[23:50] i love the god's word amen it's the best
[23:52] dying all the time
[23:54] created an automobile we quit walking
[23:58] we quit walking we would turn to blubber
[24:03] that's right brother well
[24:06] we don't have man anymore
[24:09] i mean look at the time we live in i
[24:11] don't know we have jellyfish
[24:14] quote unquote that's right amen now i
[24:17] read that because the beast at the
[24:19] beginning
[24:20] is the beast at the end amen let's turn
[24:23] to genesis 3.
[24:24] i know you all know these things but i'd
[24:26] like to have a
[24:27] solid bible foundation for them and in
[24:30] genesis 3
[24:32] it begins to speak about the beast
[24:35] at the beginning genesis 3
[24:39] 1. now the serpent
[24:42] was more subtle than any beast
[24:47] of the field how many knows what the
[24:50] word
[24:51] subtle means it's
[24:54] crafty sly
[24:59] which the lord god had made and he said
[25:02] unto the woman
[25:03] this serpent this beast could talk
[25:07] and he could talk in the language
[25:10] that eve the church understood
[25:14] amen and he said unto the woman yay
[25:19] that's right uh-huh
[25:22] let me quote it to you and god said ye
[25:25] shall not eat of every tree
[25:27] she he shall not eat of every tree of
[25:29] the garden question
[25:30] that's right huh see how he approaches
[25:34] he's not making a statement he's asking
[25:37] a question
[25:38] and the reason he's asking a question is
[25:40] because he wants to see
[25:42] where you're at yeah right amen and the
[25:45] church
[25:46] excuse me the woman said unto the
[25:48] serpent
[25:49] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[25:51] the garden
[25:52] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[25:55] the midst
[25:56] of the garden god has said ye shall not
[25:59] eat of it
[26:00] neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[26:05] and the serpent who's the beast at the
[26:08] beginning
[26:11] said unto the woman ye shall not
[26:14] surely die oh come on he's a good god
[26:17] he loves everybody yes he does
[26:21] i believe that with all my heart but the
[26:24] prophet of god defined the word love for
[26:27] us
[26:27] it's not mish-mash and mush it's not
[26:31] slobbering all over one another it's not
[26:34] buying toys and trinkets and diamonds
[26:37] and jewelry
[26:39] which we think is love you know
[26:43] the boy won't be quiet buy him a toy
[26:48] what did brother branham say spoiled
[26:50] billy paul to the max
[26:53] where did he find him in the backyard
[26:56] with a stick and a spoon and all kinds
[27:00] of toils
[27:01] why because the the attention span
[27:05] only lasts so long
[27:09] watch this devil now watch this
[27:12] serpent amen and the serpent said unto
[27:14] the woman
[27:15] ye shall not surely die for god doth
[27:19] know
[27:19] that in the day ye eat thereof then your
[27:22] eyes shall be opened
[27:23] and he shall be his gods knowing good
[27:26] and evil
[27:28] brother branham said he was preaching
[27:30] the truth right there
[27:32] he was telling her what the results were
[27:34] going to be of not
[27:35] keeping god's word and look at the mess
[27:40] it has cost we may know
[27:44] good and evil but somehow we don't know
[27:47] the difference
[27:48] between good and evil and when the woman
[27:51] saw the word saul means to understand
[27:55] that the tree was good for food
[27:57] and that it was pleasant to the eyes i'm
[28:00] going to tell you right now can i tell
[28:01] you this
[28:02] it's why pornography is so popular
[28:05] it's pleasant to the eyes
[28:09] and a tree to be desired to make one
[28:14] wise took the fruit thereof and did eat
[28:18] and gave also unto her husband with her
[28:22] and he did eat and what happened and the
[28:25] eyes of them both were open and they
[28:28] knew that they were naked and they sowed
[28:30] fig leaves together and made themselves
[28:32] apron now here's the beast
[28:35] at the beginning and brother branham was
[28:37] on his way
[28:38] home from the west stopping along the
[28:42] way
[28:42] and preaching one message after the
[28:45] other like the rapture and so forth
[28:49] and he never made it home but he had
[28:52] every
[28:53] intention of going home and preaching
[28:56] what he called about a four-hour
[28:58] message trailing
[29:01] you know because he was a guide and a
[29:04] guy
[29:05] knows how to look for sign so he was
[29:08] going to take
[29:09] all of the signs that the serpent
[29:13] left from genesis and take us
[29:16] all the way through the scripture
[29:20] to the book of revelation where the
[29:22] beast
[29:24] rears its ugly head now do you know how
[29:27] it got there
[29:29] it got there through the fall of rome
[29:31] did you know that
[29:33] now a lot of people are always squalling
[29:35] especially in this message about the
[29:37] catholic church about the catholics and
[29:39] about the pope
[29:40] well i can tell you right now that we
[29:42] love every catholic person
[29:44] there isn't one catholic person we don't
[29:46] love right
[29:48] now they're trapped that's right they
[29:50] don't know it but they're in bondage
[29:53] because they have decided
[29:55] to step out on the trail
[29:58] that this serpent left that's right now
[30:01] there would not be
[30:02] a catholic church by the way there's no
[30:05] way that peter could have been the first
[30:07] pope no that's right
[30:08] amen and some people say well that's
[30:12] because he wasn't in rome
[30:14] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[30:16] catholic church didn't come into
[30:18] existence
[30:18] till about 3 50 a.d peter had been dead
[30:22] for
[30:23] about 300 years
[30:26] so there's no way he could be the pope
[30:29] of the first
[30:30] catholic church it got its beginning
[30:35] through politics look where we're at
[30:38] brothers and sisters
[30:40] i don't stand behind the pulpit and
[30:42] preach on politics but i want everybody
[30:43] to know
[30:44] there's two horns on that one head
[30:48] and one of them is ecclesiastical which
[30:51] is religious
[30:52] which is church which is is
[30:55] is the bible in a perverted form which
[30:58] is even the message
[31:00] in a perverted form now you can't
[31:02] pervert this bible
[31:03] and you can't pervert this message but
[31:05] you have to have
[31:06] some place to begin
[31:09] and that's where satan the beast put his
[31:12] dirty hands
[31:14] on god's heritage we were to come forth
[31:18] from this word whether you realize it or
[31:21] not
[31:22] that's why jesus had to be born of a
[31:25] spoken
[31:26] word and although that word was spoken
[31:30] by god through the mouth of an angel and
[31:33] then record it
[31:35] in written history without the
[31:38] faith of one woman named mary
[31:41] without the faith of a church
[31:44] that existed at the time of the
[31:47] fulfillment of that word
[31:50] nothing would have happened it was 800
[31:53] or
[31:53] 740 years from the time isaiah
[31:57] said behold a virgin shall conceive
[32:01] until a person came along
[32:05] mary a type of the church came along
[32:09] and decided it was time
[32:14] i can do this why can't
[32:17] i be one just like
[32:20] all the other women have thought they
[32:22] were the one
[32:25] are you beginning to get it oh we're in
[32:28] a battle
[32:30] and that battle is going on right now in
[32:32] this building
[32:33] in your spirit and it is
[32:36] battling your soul for possession
[32:40] that's right amen did you realize that
[32:43] you say no
[32:44] brother i'm one with god if you were
[32:47] you'd be like enoch
[32:49] and you wouldn't be here
[32:52] that's right i got enough sense to know
[32:55] that it's going to require
[32:57] the mystical body coming to perfection
[33:01] one at a time
[33:02] one at a time but when a person comes to
[33:05] perfection
[33:06] in the mystical body of christ they are
[33:08] the most humble
[33:10] most peaceable most
[33:14] loving most kind
[33:19] but not a jellyfish now oh no
[33:22] that's they they didn't get to where
[33:25] they're at by being a jellyfish
[33:27] they got there by being a soldier
[33:31] in the army of the lord amen
[33:35] he's still with me this morning let me
[33:37] read one more thing to you
[33:39] if i could i like to give confirmation
[33:44] in the message power of transformation
[33:46] prescott arizona
[33:48] 1031 of 65 when i go home this time
[33:54] i'm preaching on the subject the trail
[33:56] of the serpent the beast at the
[33:58] beginning
[33:59] beast at the end trying to do god of
[34:02] service without it being his will
[34:04] 11 27 65.
[34:07] now when i speak paragraph 86 of
[34:10] denominations
[34:12] i'm not meaning for you to be so cruel
[34:14] and
[34:15] no i don't mean for you not to go to
[34:18] your church
[34:21] go to your church
[34:25] what you're supposed to do but just
[34:28] don't join up with them organizations
[34:31] because
[34:32] one day i'll be telling you and prove it
[34:35] by the scripture it's the mark
[34:37] of the beast and just remember
[34:40] it's the mark i'm preaching i wouldn't
[34:44] preach it in brother jack's church he'd
[34:46] tell me
[34:47] go ahead and do it but i'm going to the
[34:49] tabernacle
[34:51] it'll be about four hours long and my
[34:53] subject is the beast at the beginning
[34:55] and the beast at the end through the
[34:57] trail of a serpent
[35:00] did you notice that through the trail of
[35:03] a serpent
[35:06] over here it was the trail of the
[35:09] serpent
[35:10] all right see takes about four hours i
[35:13] got my scriptures all laying out
[35:15] that'd be i would have loved to have had
[35:17] them notes wouldn't you brother sammy
[35:19] the beast from the beginning he was the
[35:21] beast at the garden of eden he's the
[35:23] beast at the end
[35:24] and show that he's a religious person
[35:28] and a denomination that made
[35:32] the denomination and come right through
[35:34] the trail of it and prove it to you by
[35:36] the scriptures that it is
[35:39] i didn't know that till the holy spirit
[35:41] give it to me
[35:42] the other day up there i wonder how high
[35:46] up he was
[35:48] ah yeah heavenly places in christ jesus
[35:50] no doubt
[35:52] now brothers and sisters let's turn back
[35:55] to revelations if we could
[35:59] you just go with me to revelations
[36:01] chapter 12.
[36:02] we're going to read a little bit more
[36:04] out of there if that's all right
[36:07] all right i i keep forgetting you got it
[36:10] up on the board ain't nobody
[36:12] turning their bible well i hope you can
[36:15] find it in the bible but there will come
[36:16] a day brother samuel and i were talking
[36:19] when the bible has to be inscribed
[36:23] on the tables of your heart because i
[36:26] can tell you right now they're coming to
[36:27] take this away
[36:30] you may not realize especially the young
[36:32] people that have been schooled
[36:34] in a certain way and and the school
[36:36] system is
[36:37] has tried to bring generations of
[36:40] children here in the last
[36:42] 50 60 years around to and they don't
[36:45] know it
[36:46] around to a way of thinking that will
[36:50] eventually try to turn them against
[36:53] god and his word
[36:56] but of course the elect the bible tells
[37:00] us
[37:00] will not be deceived amen
[37:04] you still with me amen verse 11 where we
[37:07] left off
[37:08] in revelations 12 and they overcame him
[37:11] by the blood of the lamb
[37:13] and by the word of their testimony
[37:16] and they loved not their lives unto the
[37:19] death
[37:20] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[37:22] dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of
[37:24] the earth and of the sea
[37:26] for the devil has come down unto you
[37:28] having great wrath
[37:29] because he knoweth that he hath
[37:32] but a short time you see the devil's a
[37:34] lot sharper than we give him credit
[37:36] for he has knowledge that it's just a
[37:38] short time
[37:39] and when the dragon saw that he was cast
[37:42] under the earth
[37:44] oh did he get mad he persecuted the
[37:47] woman
[37:48] which brought forth the man-child and to
[37:51] the woman were given two wings of a
[37:52] great eagle
[37:55] praise the lord for a prophet amen that
[37:58] she might fly into the wilderness into
[38:00] her place
[38:01] where she is nourished for a time and
[38:03] times and half a time
[38:05] from the face of the serpent and the
[38:07] serpent cast
[38:08] out of his mouth water as a flood
[38:11] brothers and sisters
[38:12] what is water in this scripture peoples
[38:15] nations
[38:16] multitudes tongues look what's coming
[38:19] after us
[38:20] and the serpent cast out his mouth water
[38:24] as a flood after the woman
[38:27] these are people that he's sending out
[38:30] to chase down you and i
[38:33] and try to convince us
[38:37] that we're wrong amen right that's right
[38:40] but what does god do whenever there's a
[38:42] flood
[38:43] he raises a standard amen
[38:49] all right and that standard is his word
[38:51] amen
[38:52] that he might cause her to be carried
[38:54] away in the flood now come on
[38:56] let's look at this if enough people come
[38:59] at you enough of your friends and your
[39:02] family
[39:03] enough of your co-workers and the people
[39:06] that you're around on array
[39:07] and and the educational system they they
[39:10] send it out like a flood
[39:12] look and look at the media and how it's
[39:14] all the way it works
[39:17] and it's trying to convince you and
[39:19] bring an element of doubt into your mind
[39:22] that
[39:22] maybe just maybe
[39:25] we could be going about this the wrong
[39:27] way
[39:30] it's it's a tactic to try to convince
[39:33] you
[39:36] that maybe possibly
[39:41] and bring an element of doubt just one
[39:45] element is all
[39:48] it takes and look what
[39:52] the covet 19 has accomplished
[39:56] again not taking away from the precious
[39:58] people that we loved
[40:00] and we knew that got very sick and or
[40:02] passed
[40:03] from it but let me tell you brothers and
[40:05] sisters something if they were a
[40:06] believer
[40:08] they're in a much better place than we
[40:10] are i'll tell you that right now but
[40:13] but also as the sister was telling me
[40:15] perhaps
[40:16] it could be that god in his
[40:18] foreknowledge and i don't say it could
[40:20] be
[40:21] i say it is a fact if they passed before
[40:25] we which are alive and remain
[40:28] then they were meant to come up in the
[40:30] resurrection
[40:31] and let me quote it again to you they
[40:33] without us cannot be made
[40:36] perfect amen can you imagine i want you
[40:39] to imagine this
[40:40] brother branham went beyond the curtain
[40:41] of time is that right
[40:44] and he saw thousands or tens of
[40:47] thousands and
[40:48] maybe millions of converts
[40:54] and it looked pretty good they didn't
[40:58] have to get tired they didn't have to go
[41:00] to work didn't have to punch a clock
[41:02] they were all happy they were just
[41:05] living
[41:06] life seemingly to what we would consider
[41:09] its fullest but they were still lacking
[41:11] something through all that even brother
[41:15] branham
[41:15] said i don't want to go back right
[41:20] you've got to go back
[41:23] eventually god honored his wish and took
[41:26] him back over to that place
[41:29] amen where those people were at
[41:32] listen careful do you believe the
[41:34] prophet's there
[41:36] i'm asking you do you believe the
[41:37] prophet's there of course we do
[41:40] listen now they yes come on brother
[41:43] without us including him amen
[41:48] where's paul's group there there
[41:50] including him
[41:52] cannot be made perfect without us
[41:56] chris god has equipped us yes
[42:00] god is instilled in us something that
[42:03] will be
[42:03] able to take this battle all away to the
[42:07] end
[42:08] we will be the representatives
[42:12] of the dragon slayer did you realize
[42:18] that that old devil the serpent we call
[42:21] lucifer
[42:22] and satan is a star
[42:27] he's a hollywood star he's a music star
[42:31] he's a rap star listen now
[42:37] let's read about it isaiah 14 if you've
[42:40] got your bibles
[42:43] see i could preach for oh six seven
[42:45] hours on this one
[42:46] but i'm not gonna isaiah 14 if you would
[42:53] you know what brothers back there in the
[42:55] computer room would you do me a favor
[42:56] and implement an app that would make
[42:58] that sound like pages were turning
[43:01] okay i got it there you go
[43:04] yeah record that i'm just not used to it
[43:07] that's all
[43:08] right you love the lord amen all right
[43:12] how about if we read from verse nine you
[43:14] with me now if you've got a scofield
[43:16] bible what does it say in the margin
[43:18] above

[44:29] son of the morning we read about it how
[44:31] it happened in revelations 12
[44:33] michael and his angels fought see
[44:36] son of the morning how art thou cut
[44:40] down to the ground which that's weak in
[44:42] the nations
[44:43] for thou hast said in thine heart i will
[44:45] ascend into heaven
[44:46] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[44:51] of god that's why it's very difficult
[44:54] for young people today
[44:56] they look at all these icons and they go
[44:58] i don't know man our church is kind of
[45:00] dead
[45:00] these folks over here they got it going
[45:02] on you know all these
[45:04] all these different uh entities uh from
[45:07] hollywood and the music world and so
[45:09] forth and
[45:10] youtube now and and facebook and twitter
[45:13] and
[45:13] and instagram and all that the
[45:15] kardashians and so forth
[45:18] well i'm going to tell you that the
[45:19] kardashians unless they get converted
[45:21] are up there in verse 9 and 10.
[45:23] right no offense to them because they
[45:26] are
[45:26] souls also amen but listen i will ascend
[45:30] into heaven i will exalt my throne above
[45:32] the stars of god
[45:33] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[45:35] congregation the sides of the north
[45:37] i will ascend above the heights of the
[45:39] clouds i will be
[45:40] like he's selling himself short did you
[45:46] get it
[45:47] even his own words i will be
[45:50] like the most high when the bride of
[45:53] christ realizes that she came from god
[45:56] she'll go back to god she won't just be
[45:59] like the most high
[46:00] she will be part of the most high
[46:04] don't sell yourself short
[46:07] and i know the attitude of people oh boy
[46:12] that's how lucifer got his start no it's
[46:14] not
[46:15] no amen because those people who are
[46:18] willing to accept that they were in the
[46:20] mind of god before the foundation of the
[46:22] world
[46:22] as his attributes did not have a start
[46:32] you can see satan had a beginning
[46:36] oh how art thou fallen from heaven o
[46:39] lucifer the son
[46:41] of the morning he had a beginning
[46:46] and because he had a beginning he could
[46:48] only see the stars of heaven
[46:51] he wanted to put himself above the
[46:55] heavens
[46:56] but did you realize that there is
[46:59] something called the death
[47:01] of a star i talked to an astronomer
[47:04] friend of mine
[47:06] that i'm acquainted with that's going
[47:08] through college to be an astronomer
[47:10] and he began to talk to me about the
[47:12] death of a star
[47:13] you young people and some of you old
[47:15] people who know what it's called a
[47:16] supernova
[47:18] it's if it's just a regular star guess
[47:20] what it it's just a chevy nova yeah
[47:34] but if it's a great star if it's a
[47:35] powerful star it's called a supernova
[47:40] and what happens is it gets so great and
[47:42] so powerful
[47:44] that its own gravitational pull begins
[47:47] to collapse
[47:48] on itself that's how
[47:52] the devil got a third of the stars of
[47:54] heaven to believe his tale
[47:57] it says t-a-i-l in revelations 12 but
[48:00] brother adam
[48:01] said it's a t-a-l-e they began to
[48:05] believe
[48:06] his story and their faith began
[48:10] to erode so much so that in the book of
[48:13] jude jude said that they were
[48:17] angels that kept not their first
[48:21] estate so listen they had a god-given
[48:26] estate yes
[48:29] but it wasn't good enough it wasn't big
[48:31] enough
[48:32] it wasn't pretty enough it wasn't
[48:34] valuable enough
[48:37] can you imagine and then one of god's
[48:40] heritage saying i'd rather be the
[48:44] gatekeeper
[48:46] at the house of god then to sit
[48:49] in the seat of the ungodly and the
[48:51] scornful and then the prophet of god
[48:53] even brought it down lower than king
[48:55] david
[48:56] he said i would rather be the doormat
[49:01] brothers and sisters if you're just
[49:04] the doormat right listen careful
[49:08] you have one of the greatest
[49:10] responsibilities
[49:12] in all of the kingdom and you'd say well
[49:15] it doesn't sound
[49:16] very glorifying until you read about the
[49:19] foot wash
[49:21] flunky then you find out
[49:24] that he himself made himself
[49:27] the doormat
[49:31] i love that because he washed
[49:35] their feet he's so good to us
[49:38] let us continue i hate to get off i want
[49:41] to make sure i get this part in here
[49:43] this star is so powerful that it begins
[49:46] to collapse on itself
[49:48] so the story that it told to get it
[49:51] there
[49:51] that gravitated so-called believers
[49:55] towards it
[49:58] like a flood began
[50:01] to collapse into
[50:05] a real small dense
[50:08] property so small and so
[50:12] dense they tell us that a supernova
[50:17] explodes and
[50:20] brings into existence it don't create
[50:23] nothing
[50:24] but it what it does is the explosion of
[50:27] that supernova
[50:29] opens a gate oh glory
[50:32] and that gate is called a black hole
[50:35] right
[50:36] now i asked this astronomer because the
[50:38] lord was dealing with me all the time
[50:40] because i i was seven steps ahead of
[50:42] this fella as he's talking to me
[50:44] but since he didn't understand what we
[50:45] understand i just kept questioning
[50:47] so tell me what's on the other side of a
[50:50] black hole
[50:52] he said we don't know we can only guess
[50:55] he said but what we can see with the
[50:57] most powerful telescopes
[50:59] is when this supernova collapses
[51:01] explodes
[51:03] and then we see what looks like a black
[51:06] hole
[51:06] because there's no light emanating from
[51:10] the other side of it coming through the
[51:12] hole and this
[51:13] the debris from this collapsed star you
[51:16] see all of the believers that followed
[51:18] that old devil
[51:19] that's right oh yeah are beginning to
[51:21] swirl around
[51:23] like a whirlpool like a tornado or like
[51:25] when you flush your toilet yeah
[51:34] that's right it's going into a
[51:37] bottomless pit
[51:38] and as soon as he told me that i said oh
[51:40] amen outer darkness
[51:43] that's exactly what that speaks to me
[51:46] that's
[51:46] that's outer darkness and let me tell
[51:49] you how
[51:50] close we are to that brother branham
[51:52] said
[51:53] when he quoted the scripture weeping and
[51:56] wailing and gnashing of teeth and outer
[51:57] darkness he was not referring
[51:59] to the cannon fodder he was referring to
[52:03] the foolish virgin
[52:04] amen that's what he said so see how
[52:06] close it is
[52:08] brothers and sisters please don't settle
[52:09] for foolish virgins
[52:11] because if you think you're gonna settle
[52:13] for foolish virgin
[52:14] you're probably not one because the
[52:16] prophet of god said
[52:18] that the foolish virgin believes to the
[52:21] hundred percent of what she can believe
[52:24] that she is the bride of christ
[52:26] the only difference between her and the
[52:29] bride of christ
[52:30] is she don't have oil which is the holy
[52:32] ghost which means she wasn't
[52:34] originally in the mind of god before the
[52:36] foundation of the world
[52:38] but you were that ought to make you
[52:41] shout
[52:43] do you believe that you were
[52:46] in the mind of god before the
[52:47] foundational world you don't have a
[52:49] beginning
[52:50] right all right that's right you say
[52:52] well you don't know brother
[52:54] i got lots of problems it's a battle
[52:57] that's right brother
[53:00] god allowed his attributes to bypass
[53:04] their theophanies which by the way are
[53:06] the stars of heaven
[53:09] so that we could listen now suffer
[53:13] no be victorious see it all depends on
[53:15] your attitude
[53:17] and your attitude determines your
[53:19] altitude
[53:20] if you think you're suffering you're
[53:22] going to suffer
[53:24] but if you say this is a trial
[53:27] this is my tribulation this is going to
[53:29] perfect me
[53:30] this is going to give me patience i'm
[53:32] going to be the stature
[53:34] of a perfect man in the fullness of
[53:35] christ
[53:39] then while you're being beat upon
[53:42] you're smiling and guess what else
[53:45] you're doing
[53:46] praise the lord i'm being tried like
[53:49] gold in the fire
[53:52] and as soon as he's got all the draw
[53:54] speed out of me
[53:55] he'll be able to see his reflection
[53:58] in me i love that
[54:01] i love that speaks volumes to me
[54:05] all right let me keep moving so
[54:09] this black hole i'm calling it outer
[54:12] darkness
[54:12] i'm not making a doctrine out of it i
[54:14] just want you to know how the lord deals
[54:16] with me
[54:17] i can see it and then i said so is that
[54:21] all they know
[54:22] is that all they call it he says no he
[54:24] says some call it a wormhole
[54:29] serious he said yeah i said well what do
[54:32] they mean by that
[54:33] well they think that it's a passageway
[54:37] a shortcut in god's word there are no
[54:40] shortcuts
[54:42] but i'm going to preach this to you that
[54:44] black hole is a shortcut yeah
[54:46] sure but but not to eternal life
[54:50] not to eternal life that's right he's
[54:52] still with me
[54:53] the other thing he told me which i
[54:55] thought was fascinating
[54:57] and i couldn't explain it all to you
[54:59] some of you young folks that study
[55:01] astronomy probably could he said as
[55:04] this supernova is collapsing
[55:07] every once in a while one of them just
[55:11] turns into a small dense
[55:14] mass about 12 kilometers
[55:18] in diameter which is tiny compared to a
[55:21] planet or a star
[55:23] it's just a giant basketball yeah right
[55:25] right
[55:28] like a meteor and he said
[55:31] something begins to happen to it and it
[55:34] goes through
[55:35] a transformation and it runs through
[55:38] this transformation
[55:39] really rapidly and it starts at the top
[55:42] listen careful
[55:44] at the element table and it begins to
[55:47] go through the element table
[55:48] transforming itself from
[55:50] from this and from that and from this
[55:52] and from that and from golden from
[55:53] silver and
[55:53] that another all the way down until it
[55:55] gets to iron
[55:58] and i found this fascinating brother
[56:00] samuel when this man was telling me this
[56:01] he said when it gets to the part of the
[56:04] element table
[56:05] it's passed through and transformed
[56:07] itself into
[56:08] all these different
[56:11] elements till it gets to iron
[56:17] once it gets to iron it can't figure out
[56:20] how to go any further
[56:24] come on brother how many knows what iron
[56:28] represents
[56:30] it can't get any further than that and
[56:33] when he was talking to me about it
[56:34] transforming itself
[56:36] from one element to the other and
[56:37] stopping at iron this is what came to me
[56:39] oh
[56:39] he's trying to be a creator you see if
[56:42] he could have gotten himself all the way
[56:44] to the bottom of the element table
[56:46] and even into those those uh those
[56:48] little elements they're trying to dig up
[56:50] that the computer industries what are
[56:51] they called they're
[56:52] uh the ones that are like on a meteor
[56:54] and they're in the moon and
[56:56] they're they're looking hard for them
[56:57] because they need them
[56:59] okay he can't go there no
[57:03] brothers and sisters he can't touch us
[57:07] you see because our father yes amen is
[57:10] the creator
[57:12] and he's he didn't just run the element
[57:14] table
[57:16] he made it amen
[57:20] he made it so you can see how how
[57:22] lucifer
[57:23] is is his mindset
[57:29] is to try to be like god
[57:34] how about it how about ezekiel 28 we got
[57:37] enough time to read that let's go there
[57:39] right we can keep reading but i'd like
[57:41] to read ezekiel 28 if you'd go with me
[57:43] there
[57:45] i believe that's where it's found
[57:51] in the school field it says the rebuke
[57:52] of of the king of tyre but we'll
[57:54] we'll go down to verse 12 verse 11
[57:58] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[57:59] me
[58:00] saying son of man
[58:04] take up a lamentation upon the king of
[58:06] tyrus
[58:07] and say unto him thus saith the lord sir
[58:10] hey
[58:11] did you realize that the prophet of god
[58:13] told us in spoken word is the original
[58:16] seed
[58:16] that the bride will have thus saith the
[58:19] lord
[58:21] and the bride because she is one with
[58:23] him will
[58:24] also represent the son of man as one
[58:27] like unto
[58:29] listen careful son of man take up a
[58:31] lamentation upon the king of tirus
[58:33] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[58:36] thou
[58:36] sealest up the psalm full of wisdom
[58:40] and perfect in beauty see she recognizes
[58:43] him
[58:44] thou hast been in eden the garden of god
[58:47] how do we know that amen
[58:48] because he got one of ours every
[58:51] precious stone was thy covering
[58:53] the sardius topaz diamond that's why i
[58:56] wanted to see sister june what you guys
[58:58] all got there at the gym place see
[59:01] then the diamond the burl the onyx the
[59:03] jasper sapphire the emerald
[59:05] and the carbuncle and gold the
[59:07] workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy
[59:09] pipes was prepared in thee
[59:10] in the day that thou west here's the
[59:13] beginning now
[59:15] this is not us this is him amen
[59:20] thou art the anointed cherub that
[59:22] covereth
[59:24] watch what you're looking for yes sir
[59:26] and i have
[59:27] set these soul thou waste upon the holy
[59:29] mountain of god thou hast walked up and
[59:31] down in the midst of the stones of fire
[59:33] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[59:36] day that thou was created
[59:38] until amen iniquity was found
[59:42] in me now i could keep reading but i
[59:44] want to instill something
[59:46] in you in order for you or this
[59:49] entity to be a worker of iniquity
[59:52] you had to at one time know the truth
[59:57] because you cannot be a doer of iniquity
[1:00:00] without
[1:00:00] knowing what not or what to do
[1:00:04] right right you're with me yes sir
[1:00:07] because iniquity is to know and not do
[1:00:10] it
[1:00:11] or not do it and know you should
[1:00:14] brothers and sisters
[1:00:15] see how it's constantly just
[1:00:18] weeding out if we would say that it's
[1:00:21] it's thinning out
[1:00:23] less and less and less unless you eat
[1:00:25] this the the flesh of the son of man and
[1:00:28] drink his blood he said you have no life
[1:00:29] in you
[1:00:30] he didn't explain it prophet said he
[1:00:33] just come out and said it why
[1:00:34] to thin the crowd and then the crowd
[1:00:38] that he had
[1:00:38] left after he thinned them down of
[1:00:41] course one of them was judas iscariot
[1:00:43] that's right because it had to be so
[1:00:46] close
[1:00:47] but the other 11 said what's this guy
[1:00:51] talking about right cannibalism
[1:01:01] of the son of man yet so they did not
[1:01:05] understand what he was saying but guess
[1:01:08] what
[1:01:09] luke 17 30 says
[1:01:12] in the day that the son of man is
[1:01:15] revealed
[1:01:16] brothers and sisters you and i have what
[1:01:18] it takes
[1:01:20] to be able to discern the difference and
[1:01:23] not be workers of iniquity
[1:01:25] amen but be doers of the manifestations
[1:01:29] of the sons and daughters of god i
[1:01:32] believe that
[1:01:32] and that and i'm going to tell you as i
[1:01:34] as i wind down here that's what's going
[1:01:36] to kill him
[1:01:37] that's what's going to destroy the
[1:01:39] dragon it's not
[1:01:41] it's not a battle like you and i think
[1:01:43] it's a great battle it wasn't that way
[1:01:45] do you know that the battle that started
[1:01:47] in heaven with michael and his angels
[1:01:49] and lucifer and his angels was a church
[1:01:51] service
[1:01:52] did you know that did you know that my
[1:01:54] that's right brother michael got up
[1:01:56] there and spoke and michael had some
[1:01:57] congregational members that understood
[1:01:59] everything he said
[1:02:00] or had a revelation of what he was
[1:02:02] saying and why he was saying it
[1:02:03] and they said amen all right
[1:02:07] now i want to ask you a personal
[1:02:08] question if if i
[1:02:10] was the devil if i was
[1:02:13] lucifer and you knew it let's say i have
[1:02:16] my name tag
[1:02:17] lucifer what's yours
[1:02:20] right and i was gonna get and you knew
[1:02:23] what you know about him
[1:02:26] and i was gonna get up behind the pulpit
[1:02:30] would you say amen eve did
[1:02:33] he did mistake
[1:02:37] you never say amen
[1:02:40] to a portion of the word of god right
[1:02:44] you say amen to every single
[1:02:48] word and that's where
[1:02:52] the dragon is being slain
[1:02:56] as long as he's got a congregation of
[1:02:59] people
[1:03:00] and of course in revelations 12 it says
[1:03:03] one third yeah that's right but that's
[1:03:06] not what the prophet said
[1:03:08] in every case that's right i'm going to
[1:03:11] read that one
[1:03:13] because it would be a needful for me to
[1:03:16] hurry
[1:03:17] i told the sister that i was going to
[1:03:19] preach on angels
[1:03:20] so let me read this first do i have a
[1:03:22] little bit of time brother samuel
[1:03:27] questions and answers law having a
[1:03:29] shadow
[1:03:30] 5 16 of 54.
[1:03:34] paragraph 68 the dragon who was the
[1:03:37] dragon he says congregation says
[1:03:39] satan satan that's right and what
[1:03:43] nation did it represent congregation
[1:03:45] says rome
[1:03:48] and he had angels didn't the bible say
[1:03:52] that in the last days that the
[1:03:53] ministering spirits of the devil
[1:03:55] would be like flaming angels
[1:03:59] but if they speak not according to this
[1:04:03] let them alone the devil will transform
[1:04:06] his messengers
[1:04:08] into angels of light and organize right
[1:04:12] back
[1:04:12] just exactly like rome did that's the
[1:04:15] reason why he can't go any further
[1:04:18] than iron on the element table
[1:04:21] okay because that's all he's been given
[1:04:24] by the lord
[1:04:25] he can only go this far brother
[1:04:28] sister i don't see where you could find
[1:04:30] a loophole in that
[1:04:32] but they look for them they're wormholes
[1:04:36] and i'm going to tell you that wormhole
[1:04:38] is just a fancy pants name
[1:04:40] for outer darkness god has just got it
[1:04:44] all walled up there
[1:04:45] right here in his word there it is and
[1:04:48] he's
[1:04:48] he said he did now watch and michael the
[1:04:51] archangel the great one that stands in
[1:04:53] the presence of god
[1:04:54] and his angels fought against satan and
[1:04:56] his angels
[1:04:57] the red dragon listen now look at the
[1:04:59] next one and that was the church
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:04] that's led by the holy spirit and the
[1:05:07] angels of god fought against the
[1:05:09] organization
[1:05:10] and its angels and ministers of light
[1:05:12] what you mean there was an organization
[1:05:14] in heaven
[1:05:15] that's where it all started that's where
[1:05:17] denomination started
[1:05:19] do you know what the word denomination
[1:05:20] really means
[1:05:22] if you go back to its roots it means the
[1:05:25] value
[1:05:26] of a name that's why
[1:05:30] for us older folks excuse me young
[1:05:32] people you may not know this
[1:05:33] but the one dollar bill was called a one
[1:05:35] dollar denominational note
[1:05:37] the five dollar bill was called a five
[1:05:39] dollar denominational note
[1:05:40] now the two most famous presidents of
[1:05:42] this country are on the one and the five
[1:05:44] why
[1:05:45] you'd think they'd be worth on the ten
[1:05:47] thousand dollar bill and the hundred
[1:05:48] thousand dollar bill
[1:05:49] as great amen as they were but what
[1:05:51] people don't realize is the thinking of
[1:05:53] the founding fathers which we're not
[1:05:55] supposed to use that name happy father's
[1:05:57] day
[1:05:57] that's right happy father's day to them
[1:06:01] too
[1:06:02] was the fact that they realized that the
[1:06:05] common man would handle a lot more one
[1:06:07] dollar and five dollar bills and they'd
[1:06:08] never
[1:06:09] see a hundred dollar bill so the more
[1:06:12] popular the president what looks like
[1:06:16] the lower denomination gives his name
[1:06:20] more value he came
[1:06:24] not to be served but he came to serve he
[1:06:27] came to humble himself
[1:06:29] you see denomination means the value of
[1:06:32] a name
[1:06:33] the most valuable name the name above
[1:06:36] every name amen
[1:06:37] is the lord jesus christ but the reason
[1:06:41] why
[1:06:42] the love of money is the root of how
[1:06:44] much evil
[1:06:46] a-l-l all evil the law not money
[1:06:49] but the love of money is the root of all
[1:06:51] evil because
[1:06:52] satan wants you to value
[1:06:56] himself and you higher yes
[1:07:00] yes that's right than god himself right
[1:07:04] because he set out to exalt himself
[1:07:08] above all that is called god
[1:07:11] in thessalonians or sits in the house of
[1:07:13] god
[1:07:15] brothers and sisters do you realize that
[1:07:19] god has given you the greatest
[1:07:21] value that he could bestow upon anybody
[1:07:25] and it was by faith that he did it
[1:07:28] it takes 100 lots
[1:07:32] to make an abraham right yep that's
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:35] god values the silver dollar
[1:07:39] higher than any denominational note
[1:07:43] there is what does silver mean
[1:07:47] redemption because brother banham tells
[1:07:50] us that the plan of redemption was
[1:07:52] only written for one class one group
[1:07:55] absolutely
[1:07:56] one entity and that's the elect
[1:07:58] everybody else that gets salvation out
[1:08:01] of this deal
[1:08:02] is collateral benefits
[1:08:05] that's that's what i call it collateral
[1:08:07] benefits
[1:08:09] everybody else's collateral damage i'm
[1:08:12] sorry if this sounds hurtful but brother
[1:08:14] branham called him cannon
[1:08:15] fodder you know what cannon fodder is
[1:08:19] have any of you young people ever had
[1:08:20] one of them little things on the fourth
[1:08:22] of july you pull the string and pop all
[1:08:23] this stuff comes out of it
[1:08:25] that's fire yeah yeah just floats to the
[1:08:29] ground
[1:08:30] and gets walked on and disintegrates
[1:08:34] yeah
[1:08:34] that's right but not the bride of christ
[1:08:39] she is the true dragon slayer and i'll
[1:08:41] just cut to the chase for time this is
[1:08:43] how she does it
[1:08:45] revelations if you would chapter 20.
[1:08:55] god is good all the time
[1:09:00] he put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:09:04] mine
[1:09:05] god is good you got it
[1:09:09] do i hear them pages turning well
[1:09:13] i'm just used to it revelation 20 verse
[1:09:16] 1 and i saw an angel
[1:09:19] come down from heaven now remember
[1:09:22] something brothers and sisters the book
[1:09:23] of revelation is the book of symbols
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:26] i've already preached this here it's our
[1:09:27] book amen
[1:09:30] it's a specific book meant for a
[1:09:31] specific group of people
[1:09:33] they are prophetic class they understand
[1:09:36] the types and the shadows
[1:09:38] that every scripture listen now the
[1:09:40] prophet said and every prophecy is
[1:09:42] compound
[1:09:42] amen okay and i saw an angel
[1:09:46] and here we are thinking that we're
[1:09:48] watching television
[1:09:51] no i understood that an angel
[1:09:55] come down from heaven is that right
[1:09:59] like revelations 10 amen all right
[1:10:02] having the key of the bottomless
[1:10:06] pit yes i love it now we're thinking
[1:10:10] of a key but the prophet of god said god
[1:10:13] does not have skeleton keys his key
[1:10:16] is the word every time
[1:10:21] having the key of the bottomless pit
[1:10:23] what's a bottomless pit
[1:10:24] without foundation that is the reason
[1:10:28] why people
[1:10:29] find themselves in the condition they
[1:10:32] find themselves in
[1:10:34] many years down the road is because they
[1:10:36] did not receive the right
[1:10:38] foundation now now now to your
[1:10:41] consolation
[1:10:42] if you found yourself with the right
[1:10:44] with the wrong foundation brother
[1:10:46] branham said tear it down
[1:10:48] that's right amen he's given you the
[1:10:50] opportunity to start
[1:10:52] over oh it'll take me years oh no it's
[1:10:55] the twinkling
[1:10:57] of an eye you can be to the stature of
[1:11:01] listen the prophet of god taught you
[1:11:02] could be bap repent be baptized in water
[1:11:05] receive the holy ghost coming up out of
[1:11:07] the water and be sealed
[1:11:11] but most of us have a battle to fight
[1:11:14] right a journey that we have to go on
[1:11:18] a walk that we have to walk and a talk
[1:11:20] that we have to talk why
[1:11:22] because god wants to experience and he
[1:11:25] is
[1:11:25] through you and i every nuance yes
[1:11:29] every strange even even
[1:11:32] listen now every unbelieving thought now
[1:11:35] god doesn't take those thoughts into him
[1:11:37] but he understands what it means
[1:11:42] to be tempted because the bible says he
[1:11:45] was
[1:11:45] tempted on every single
[1:11:49] point right whoa that's temptation amen
[1:11:54] but what did he say not my will
[1:11:58] but thine be done i do nothing he said
[1:12:00] unless the father
[1:12:01] shows me first now brothers and sisters
[1:12:04] he didn't bypass his theophany we did
[1:12:07] but the father is showing us that's
[1:12:08] right that's right
[1:12:10] are you willing to take it that's the
[1:12:13] key amen
[1:12:14] this bottomless pit has no foundation
[1:12:17] when brother branham was shot by one of
[1:12:19] his
[1:12:20] childhood friends with the shotgun in
[1:12:22] the legs and lost all that blood and
[1:12:23] went to the hospital
[1:12:24] do you realize that william mariam
[1:12:26] branham was falling
[1:12:28] into this bottomless pit the same one
[1:12:33] that everyone falls into if they don't
[1:12:36] have
[1:12:37] the seal of god amen right yes sir
[1:12:41] but because god's right he was lost he
[1:12:44] was undone
[1:12:46] but because it wasn't his time and god
[1:12:49] was going to use him
[1:12:51] god put something in his heart there was
[1:12:53] no mother there there was no father
[1:12:54] listen listen this outer darkness this
[1:12:56] black hole the reason it's a black hole
[1:12:58] is because brother brown said there's no
[1:12:59] god there
[1:13:00] no oh he could go there if he wanted to
[1:13:02] but he doesn't want to so he's not there
[1:13:04] no right that's right yeah because he
[1:13:07] said that there was no god there
[1:13:08] i cried bob dad grandpa pastor
[1:13:12] oh god yep he had no foundation yet
[1:13:17] and started the work to build the
[1:13:20] stature of a perfect man in the fullness
[1:13:23] of christ and brother branham says that
[1:13:26] we can build on
[1:13:27] and on and on and we'll get up towards
[1:13:29] the top of that
[1:13:30] that that that stature and we'll be
[1:13:32] tempted and we'll be
[1:13:33] our temperance or our patience or
[1:13:35] something will be tried that's way down
[1:13:37] below
[1:13:37] and we'll fail brother brown said you
[1:13:40] never got that sealed
[1:13:42] go back to that point and get that
[1:13:46] sealed it doesn't take away from what
[1:13:48] you already have
[1:13:50] but it does allow for that
[1:13:54] weak spot to be made strong
[1:13:58] still with me yes sir all right let me
[1:14:00] move along
[1:14:04] you can tell i like this subject
[1:14:07] key to the bottomless pit and a great
[1:14:09] chain in this hand
[1:14:13] i know a lot of preachers have preached
[1:14:15] on this i'm okay with that
[1:14:16] cause i'm gonna preach on it and he laid
[1:14:19] hold on the dragon
[1:14:21] come here boy i got you now
[1:14:25] okay that old serpent which is the devil
[1:14:28] and satan
[1:14:29] see see the beast at the beginning and
[1:14:31] the beast at the end
[1:14:32] and bound him a thousand years and cast
[1:14:35] him
[1:14:35] into the bottomless pit and shut him up
[1:14:37] and set a seal upon him
[1:14:39] now it's not us getting a seal it's us
[1:14:41] giving it
[1:14:42] amen i'll tell you how i know it's us
[1:14:46] let me cut to the quit
[1:14:49] questions and answers 8 23 of 64 in the
[1:14:52] morning
[1:14:53] paragraph 222 now there you are to the
[1:14:56] question a while ago
[1:14:57] see at the judgment seat here we go
[1:15:00] brother samuel
[1:15:02] jesus the church
[1:15:06] amen come on did you realize he just
[1:15:09] said jesus
[1:15:11] the church don't that make you feel good
[1:15:15] makes me feel good amen
[1:15:18] because jesus and the church
[1:15:22] are one
[1:15:26] anyhow i believe this yeah man that's
[1:15:30] why it excites me so much
[1:15:32] so i believe this is me this is you
[1:15:35] this is us now you have a choice in this
[1:15:39] god voted for you satan voted against
[1:15:42] you now you vote
[1:15:44] and this isn't going to be a corrupt
[1:15:46] dominion
[1:15:47] voting machine notice the name of it
[1:15:50] dominion yeah
[1:15:54] this is entirely up to you nobody can
[1:15:58] interfere but you choose this day whom
[1:15:59] you will serve
[1:16:01] right it's a battle jesus the church the
[1:16:06] bride was raptured went up into glory
[1:16:08] and was up there and was married
[1:16:10] returned back to the earth and lived a
[1:16:11] thousand years and at the end of the
[1:16:13] thousand years satan was loosed out of
[1:16:15] his prison but what i got down here was
[1:16:17] what bound him what put him in that
[1:16:18] prison how did he get there
[1:16:21] he's out loose out of his prison that is
[1:16:23] bound by an angel with a chain
[1:16:27] not a log chain he's meaning not a
[1:16:30] natural
[1:16:31] big sick link chain but a chain of
[1:16:35] circumstance all of his subjects
[1:16:38] was in hell yeah right absolutely listen
[1:16:41] now
[1:16:42] that's why i read isaiah and ezekiel to
[1:16:44] you
[1:16:46] all that was resurrected on the earth
[1:16:48] was redeemed and jesus with them listen
[1:16:50] now
[1:16:51] this is what binds him this is what gets
[1:16:54] him thrown
[1:16:55] into the bottomless pit and this is how
[1:16:59] you and i come into this this is how we
[1:17:02] slay the dragon
[1:17:03] how do we slam because he doesn't have
[1:17:08] anything it's up there somewhere to work
[1:17:11] with
[1:17:13] the quote not that scripture
[1:17:17] i thought they'd have it up there
[1:17:18] they're faster than i am
[1:17:20] bound by an angel with a chain not a
[1:17:22] long chain but a chain of circumstance
[1:17:24] all of his subjects was in hell all that
[1:17:27] was resurrected on the earth was
[1:17:28] redeemed and jesus
[1:17:30] with them he couldn't work on nothing
[1:17:35] you see how we're binding him we're
[1:17:37] giving him nothing to work with
[1:17:40] the lord cannon fodder turns to nothing
[1:17:44] the only thing that's right brother
[1:17:46] ronnie the only thing he has to work
[1:17:47] with is you and me
[1:17:48] as god's heritage that's why he
[1:17:51] approached
[1:17:52] adam and eve how come he didn't go
[1:17:55] approach his own kind
[1:17:57] because he could see i'm going to tell
[1:17:59] you guys something that
[1:18:00] really really fascinates me the serpent
[1:18:03] was an innocent beast
[1:18:08] but what i'm saying is the serpent
[1:18:13] how could he be guilty he was an
[1:18:16] innocent beast
[1:18:18] but because he cast the wrong vote
[1:18:23] he was turned into that's right the
[1:18:26] rhythm
[1:18:27] snake let me get that part
[1:18:30] the names dragon
[1:18:35] means serpent
[1:18:38] and there's a constellation not just the
[1:18:41] twins
[1:18:42] that's right not just the virgin
[1:18:45] not just the cancer the crab not just
[1:18:48] leo the lion but there is a
[1:18:49] constellation of twins
[1:18:50] and we all know that brother branham
[1:18:52] taught us that the 12 stations of the
[1:18:54] zodiac was the first bible the reason
[1:18:56] why we don't use that bible anymore
[1:18:58] is because when the earth was knocked
[1:19:00] off its axis in the days of noah it
[1:19:02] could not be correctly read
[1:19:07] but it was readable at one time it spoke
[1:19:10] of the same things that you and i
[1:19:12] are receiving this morning but god
[1:19:15] decided
[1:19:16] to move
[1:19:21] yes forward he allowed a pyramid to be
[1:19:23] built that's right did y'all know that
[1:19:25] brother branham said that enoch
[1:19:27] carried the blueprints
[1:19:32] that's why he called the enoch's pyramid
[1:19:34] not the pyramid of chiops and not the
[1:19:35] great pyramid and not the pyramid of
[1:19:37] king tut
[1:19:40] but it was a bible now we're not into
[1:19:43] pyramid teachings he said
[1:19:45] it's also a memorial
[1:19:49] that you cannot destroy god
[1:19:52] or his word or what it stands for
[1:19:56] but here we are today with a paper bible
[1:20:00] but they're going by the wayside because
[1:20:02] i can't hear them pages turning brother
[1:20:03] samuel
[1:20:06] sorry so it's okay i want i'm making a
[1:20:08] point so it's got to become
[1:20:10] written in your heart not on a computer
[1:20:13] chip
[1:20:15] yes not on a video recording audio
[1:20:18] recording
[1:20:20] it's got to be engraved
[1:20:23] on the tables of your heart
[1:20:26] because brothers and sisters at the end
[1:20:28] of this battle they're coming after us
[1:20:30] yes sir like a flood can't you see it
[1:20:34] amen but god will raise a standard
[1:20:37] and that standard will be his word and
[1:20:41] that word
[1:20:42] is the bride because she and the word
[1:20:46] have become one
[1:20:47] according to the words of the prophet
[1:20:51] amen there's a constellation in all of
[1:20:54] those listen now
[1:20:55] there's a 13th constellation
[1:21:00] but it's not in the original yeah
[1:21:04] what's what's the number of this nation
[1:21:07] 13. what are we we are and the anti-type
[1:21:11] of
[1:21:12] israel that's right okay that's right
[1:21:15] and it's called draco
[1:21:18] the dragon serpent
[1:21:22] means to creep you want to get all the
[1:21:25] creepy things out of your life
[1:21:26] no wonder why they call him creepy joe
[1:21:29] yeah that's right
[1:21:30] yeah i mean i'm just repeating what they
[1:21:33] said
[1:21:34] amen they say a lot of things the devil
[1:21:38] in hebrew means satan like satan
[1:21:41] in the greek it's diablos what is the
[1:21:43] devil you want to get rid of him
[1:21:45] i'll tell you how to get rid of him
[1:21:46] don't give him anything to work with
[1:21:48] because he's an accuser stop accusing
[1:21:51] he's the backbiter
[1:21:52] stop backbone i got this from the
[1:21:54] dictionary he's a slanderer stop
[1:21:56] slandering
[1:21:57] okay he he's he's set at variance
[1:22:02] quit being coming independent and going
[1:22:03] off by yourself all the time
[1:22:05] this is the mystical body of christ
[1:22:06] you're either in the body or out of the
[1:22:08] body
[1:22:09] if you're in the body you're in
[1:22:10] fellowship with the rest of the body
[1:22:12] you're not some independent watch now
[1:22:14] star
[1:22:15] all by itself because if you find
[1:22:18] yourself in that condition
[1:22:19] satan can deal with you
[1:22:22] get in as quickly as
[1:22:26] you can how do i get in the bible says
[1:22:29] you're baptized
[1:22:31] into the body by the holy ghost
[1:22:34] you're with me the devil means accuser
[1:22:37] backbiter slanderer set at variance
[1:22:38] it means he's an attacker listen now the
[1:22:42] the dictionary said this as in a
[1:22:44] person's
[1:22:45] character today brother brandon said you
[1:22:48] don't have to literally kill somebody
[1:22:50] all you have to do is work that mouth
[1:22:55] and begin to destroy their character
[1:22:58] influence that's right take them down a
[1:22:59] little bit take them down
[1:23:00] hey did you know brother so-and-so
[1:23:02] that's why that's why it's very
[1:23:04] difficult for
[1:23:05] people like brother samuel and i to
[1:23:06] mention people's names truthfully
[1:23:09] because we realize what they are and who
[1:23:11] they are but we don't want to be
[1:23:13] responsible for defining the word devil
[1:23:19] but i do know that the lord taught us
[1:23:22] something
[1:23:23] in the way that he handled the sadducees
[1:23:25] and the pharisees
[1:23:27] because everybody's saying oh let's all
[1:23:29] get together
[1:23:30] if you want to get in together around
[1:23:31] the word amen
[1:23:33] but just getting together brother
[1:23:36] branham
[1:23:37] said god never forgave israel
[1:23:41] for the action of just getting
[1:23:44] together you're with me satan means
[1:23:48] adversary
[1:23:49] always viewed as an angel the dictionary
[1:23:52] said a messenger
[1:23:54] lucifer the morning star he's light
[1:23:58] and bearing light
[1:24:01] watch this chain of circumstance as i as
[1:24:04] i finish
[1:24:07] let me give you one more questions and

[1:24:10] 8 30 of 64 in the morning
[1:24:14] paragraph 149 no a generation a lot and
[1:24:17] then the bible is 40 years but the bible
[1:24:19] said and they
[1:24:20] lived and reigned with christ one
[1:24:21] thousand years
[1:24:23] it will be 1 000 years upon the earth
[1:24:25] because 1 000 years upon the earth has
[1:24:27] only counted a time
[1:24:29] for parable like to god as one day one
[1:24:32] thousand years upon the earth is only
[1:24:34] one day with god
[1:24:35] as god counting time how many
[1:24:37] understands that now
[1:24:39] that's found in the book of peter if you
[1:24:40] didn't know that so it's
[1:24:42] that sabbath day when the church will no
[1:24:45] more labor against sin
[1:24:47] and satan is bound for a little season
[1:24:51] a thousand years because his
[1:24:54] subjects is all in hell
[1:24:58] the church that's on earth is redeemed
[1:25:01] and right in the presence of christ so
[1:25:04] he has
[1:25:05] nothing he can work on
[1:25:08] that's right so it's not
[1:25:12] a chain as i said a log chain it's a
[1:25:14] chain of circumstance
[1:25:16] he has nothing he can do he's
[1:25:19] helpless and hopeless the bible says
[1:25:23] just waiting for the resurrection of the
[1:25:26] subjects
[1:25:27] that would be the second judgment right
[1:25:29] the second resurrection the white throne
[1:25:31] judgment
[1:25:32] and let me finish with this spoken word
[1:25:34] is the original seed
[1:25:38] part 2 paragraph three twenty six and
[1:25:40] eight god is taking the elect
[1:25:42] out of that pentecostal church that
[1:25:45] hybrid pulling it out
[1:25:47] finishing up the word finishing up the
[1:25:51] word that's you and me
[1:25:53] this has already been completed
[1:25:56] and it's got to be so close until the
[1:25:59] word itself
[1:26:00] will blend with this word
[1:26:04] that's you and me and it's got to be so
[1:26:08] close until the word itself will blend
[1:26:10] with this word there comes the headstone
[1:26:12] crying grace grace amazing grace did you
[1:26:15] not speak on grace this morning
[1:26:17] the headstone here you are like this see
[1:26:20] on there he's part probably pointing to
[1:26:22] the statue of a perfect man
[1:26:24] see how it weighs way wide down here at
[1:26:26] the bottom it keeps getting closer
[1:26:28] closer closer to ministry
[1:26:30] he says after a while here here come
[1:26:33] luther justification justified fighter
[1:26:35] come wesley sanctified bunch
[1:26:37] here come pentecostal restoration of the
[1:26:39] gifts now god
[1:26:40] is taking from there amen yeah right
[1:26:43] right buddy holding out a bunch
[1:26:46] if you young people don't know what a
[1:26:48] horn is it's like a piece of sandpaper
[1:26:52] it's like the stone you sharpen the edge
[1:26:56] of your knife with it's just rough
[1:26:59] enough
[1:26:59] to smooth out all the edges
[1:27:03] and put a sharp edge on both sides and a
[1:27:07] point
[1:27:08] begins to form you get the point
[1:27:11] here come pentecostal restoration of the
[1:27:13] gifts now god is taking from there
[1:27:15] holding out a bunch to make a ministry
[1:27:19] brothers and sisters don't let anybody
[1:27:21] take this away from you
[1:27:23] when somebody tries to tell you the
[1:27:25] fivefold ministry was all in william
[1:27:26] mary and branham
[1:27:27] you know what i could say well wait a
[1:27:29] minute brother wade i could say amen but
[1:27:30] he's not here that's right amen
[1:27:32] all right that's right yes now the
[1:27:35] five-fold ministry
[1:27:37] is in the mystical body of christ
[1:27:41] and you'd say well brother oh i don't
[1:27:43] have one of those titles
[1:27:44] you don't need one you just need to be
[1:27:46] in the body
[1:27:48] amen and take advantage
[1:27:51] of what god has instilled in that body
[1:27:53] for you amen
[1:27:55] and for me amen
[1:27:58] to make a ministry just exactly like the
[1:28:00] word there because it's got to
[1:28:02] fit with the word there's the bride
[1:28:05] take her up now christ was manifested
[1:28:09] to destroy the works of the devil amen
[1:28:13] you believe that amen now i can't
[1:28:16] explain all this
[1:28:18] i'm just going to go through it just
[1:28:20] quickly now
[1:28:21] hit the high place so you won't stay too
[1:28:24] long
[1:28:25] oh praise the lord let's not stay too
[1:28:27] long
[1:28:28] quit prolonging this let's get to these
[1:28:32] high places
[1:28:34] christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:28:36] works of the devil is that right
[1:28:38] congregation says
[1:28:40] you all believe that that's why what was
[1:28:43] he god's word
[1:28:44] which destroys the works of the hybrid
[1:28:46] the devil is that right
[1:28:48] he was done to do that he was born to be
[1:28:51] that to destroy the works of the devil
[1:28:53] now listen careful
[1:28:54] this last paragraph is the most
[1:28:55] important one now his body
[1:28:58] is to do the same thing
[1:29:01] amen amen we are
[1:29:05] the chain of circumstances
[1:29:09] and we've all heard it a chain is only
[1:29:11] as strong
[1:29:13] as its weakest link but i think if i'm
[1:29:16] paraphrasing correctly didn't the
[1:29:17] prophet say the weakest
[1:29:19] christians come on on his knees
[1:29:23] is stronger glory than any devil
[1:29:27] amen than any satan than any lucifer yes
[1:29:30] true brother than any dragon yes
[1:29:33] we're binding the dragon right now man
[1:29:35] right whether you realize it or not
[1:29:38] by believing every word amen and by
[1:29:41] taking our life and pouring it into that
[1:29:43] belief
[1:29:44] and becoming the manifestation for
[1:29:47] everything is groaning
[1:29:48] yes sir everything is waiting this world
[1:29:51] is upside down backwards and inside out
[1:29:54] guess what mother earth
[1:29:57] is asking for you and me
[1:30:00] please stand we are the chain of
[1:30:03] circumstances
[1:30:05] we will destroy the dragon we will win
[1:30:08] the war of words
[1:30:10] we will we will represent the death
[1:30:17] bringing that star to its death
[1:30:20] but remember the results of that is a
[1:30:22] black hole outer darkness
[1:30:25] we can't help that that's just the
[1:30:28] result
[1:30:29] of what god is permitting us to do
[1:30:32] brothers and sisters
[1:30:33] but today is the day of salvation let's
[1:30:36] pray father

[1:30:44] try to bring that reader's digest
[1:30:46] version of a word that had no beginning
[1:30:48] and have no end is nearly impossible

[1:30:52] at one time father

[1:31:06] oh father we're asking lord that these
[1:31:08] words that were spoken
[1:31:10] as broken as they were father would be

[1:31:17] there father
