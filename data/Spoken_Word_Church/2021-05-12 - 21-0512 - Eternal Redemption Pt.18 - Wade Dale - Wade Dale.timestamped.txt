[11:07] and you'll get more if you sit up there
[11:09] amen
[11:10] hey man
[11:14] a little bit of a generational change i
[11:16] was telling them before service usually
[11:17] the older
[11:18] folks were sitting right there in that
[11:20] little spot and and that generation is
[11:23] moving on and a new generation is coming
[11:25] in
[11:25] so that's the way god works he doesn't
[11:27] leave a generation out
[11:28] amen amen he doesn't leave he doesn't
[11:32] skip a generation
[11:33] god never skips a generation i'll
[11:36] remember too that brother dutch said to
[11:37] tell you
[11:38] hello and god bless you and um
[11:41] that uh he we had a good time this
[11:44] weekend on mother's day
[11:46] with them and something i hadn't seen in
[11:48] a long time and
[11:50] i want to say this for the glory of the
[11:52] lord
[11:54] but a lot of times we we think well
[11:57] maybe during the song service
[11:59] we need to you know be you know getting
[12:02] getting it ready and getting everything
[12:04] ready to go and maybe the spirit's gonna
[12:06] fall and maybe somebody will shout and
[12:09] the bible tells me that that the
[12:11] preaching of the word is what always
[12:13] brought this
[12:13] kind of glory down it wasn't the singing
[12:16] now the singing was to set the tone we
[12:18] know that
[12:19] but we were we were preaching just on
[12:21] justification sanctification of baptism
[12:23] the holy ghost of brother duchess and
[12:24] the spirit of the lord fell
[12:26] in the middle of that service and i
[12:28] wasn't
[12:29] i wasn't i was at the end of the down at
[12:31] the aisle preaching away but
[12:32] i mean man that was one sister got to
[12:34] shout and then another couple of sisters
[12:36] got to crying and praising the lord
[12:39] and you know what it was just a
[12:40] wonderful service and but
[12:42] and leading into that we're going to uh
[12:47] brother bob you're going to change send
[12:49] another one out here we're we're
[12:50] developing this plan we're not like god
[12:52] he has an eternal plan never changes
[12:54] ours is not eternal and it does change
[12:57] so if you pull it up on the screen here
[13:00] this is what we're going to be doing
[13:02] starting sunday up here
[13:04] it's been changed just a little bit
[13:06] y'all did great
[13:07] sunday so leave everything where it's at
[13:09] if you're downstairs so but upstairs
[13:12] 9 30 to 9 45 you're gonna have brother
[13:14] brown pre-service that's we do that
[13:15] anyway
[13:16] all right now from 9 45 to 10 15.
[13:20] brother terrence is going to have to
[13:21] take prayer requests and then i'm going
[13:22] to come up and teach sunday school
[13:24] for about 20 or so minutes and i was
[13:27] praying on the way up to illinois sunday
[13:30] and
[13:31] the lord just kind of spoke to me and
[13:33] said just don't take a subject
[13:35] take up one word and me and sister jim
[13:38] got talking about
[13:40] one word prayer then we'll take another
[13:43] word
[13:44] redemption then we'll take another word
[13:47] grace and then we'll take another word
[13:48] something else and we'll talk about it
[13:51] but brother brown was talking about
[13:52] prayer
[13:53] but the bible tells us as was talking
[13:55] about brother dutch is the bible tells
[13:56] us many many times in the book of acts
[13:58] that as the preaching
[13:59] was going on the holy ghost would fall
[14:01] on the people fill them with the holy
[14:03] ghost and they would be
[14:04] you know they'd have a good service so
[14:06] that's kind of what we want to look at
[14:08] that
[14:08] but we'll have prayer reque request
[14:10] adult sunday school class from 9 45 to
[14:12] 10 15.
[14:13] all right that will be up here you
[14:16] downstairs
[14:16] this has nothing to do with you okay
[14:19] you're doing what you normally do
[14:20] then from 10 15 what i'll do is is
[14:24] i'll tell the musicians to start coming
[14:26] up when i wind it down
[14:28] and then brother joe will take his
[14:31] service
[14:32] of songs taking up the the tithes and
[14:34] offerings and have responsive reading
[14:37] to 10 40 and then brother dale will be
[14:40] in the pulpit
[14:41] or whoever's preaching that sunday so
[14:43] everybody got that
[14:45] just a little bit of shift we were gonna
[14:47] we were gonna do it in two parts
[14:48] this is the sunday school format it
[14:50] stays the same
[14:53] so this just basically tells you who's
[14:54] going what the classes are
[14:58] um sister monica will be gone
[15:01] this coming sunday right sister lisa can
[15:03] you swap over and do hers
[15:06] thank you ma'am and but the rest of them
[15:09] will be the same and then the adult
[15:10] sunday school class
[15:12] will be up here from 9 45 to 10 15. so
[15:16] it's just changed a little bit from what
[15:18] you all got and i appreciate brother bob
[15:19] and brother joe
[15:20] sending those out but we had discussed
[15:22] it actually brother aaron came up with
[15:24] this idea and dad and i discussed it
[15:26] and thought that maybe this would give
[15:28] more continuity to the service
[15:30] instead of having songs and doing stuff
[15:32] here and then stopping and having
[15:34] sunday school and then starting it all
[15:35] over again to just go ahead and do first
[15:37] sunday school and then get into the song
[15:39] service we don't want to take away from
[15:41] the song servers but we don't want to
[15:42] take away from the word
[15:44] i mean because the word's most important
[15:45] thing but you do need the song service
[15:47] it has to be a balance
[15:48] so that's what we're going to be doing
[15:51] starting this coming sunday
[15:52] amen also remember
[15:56] that uh brother aaron will be preaching
[15:59] next
[16:00] he's not here next wednesday night so
[16:03] i think that's about got it so let's bow
[16:05] our heads we're going to continue on
[16:07] eternal redemption
[16:08] we're going to bring out a little
[16:09] thought tonight we're talking about
[16:10] generations
[16:12] but there's a man that came on earth
[16:16] that was cut off from his generation
[16:19] amen and we'll read that in isaiah once
[16:21] we get the background done and we'll try
[16:22] to
[16:23] hurry through this on wednesday night so
[16:26] let's bow our heads
[16:27] the heavenly father we pray that you'd
[16:28] be with us tonight sanctify us lord
[16:31] you know what we want to speak to the
[16:33] people but father if it's not
[16:34] according to what you want lord just
[16:36] erase it and you do the speaking father
[16:39] be with the ones lord that are sick and
[16:40] not here be with the ones on the
[16:42] highways
[16:43] lord just let this gas shortage be done
[16:45] and over with
[16:47] and even if it is lord you said you'd
[16:48] take care of your little bride lord so
[16:50] we'll be able to find gas when maybe
[16:52] other people will not
[16:54] and i lord we depend on you that's what
[16:56] you're asking us it too is to depend on
[16:58] you
[16:59] not to depend on man or depend on the
[17:03] uh some kind of computer program but
[17:05] depend on you lord
[17:06] because you're we're the bride and you
[17:08] said you'd take care of us lord
[17:10] father forgive us of our sins bless us
[17:12] and take care of us in this service
[17:14] may we be attentive and listen to you
[17:15] father in jesus name we pray
[17:18] amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being
[17:20] coming high priest of good things to
[17:22] come by a greater more perfect
[17:23] tabernacle
[17:24] not made with hands that is to say not
[17:26] of this building
[17:28] now that's we're going to talk about
[17:29] christ here in just a little bit because
[17:30] he's the
[17:31] he's the he's the the center center
[17:35] of this whole plan all right he's the
[17:38] center person of this whole plan
[17:41] and he really came comes right in the
[17:43] center of the plan
[17:44] amen so he comes in to where he can take
[17:47] the old testament bring them in
[17:49] and then what become the the
[17:52] mediator the bible says but he's the new
[17:55] testator that's
[17:56] that we are living under now which is
[17:58] the new testament not doing away with
[17:59] the old testament
[18:01] but just bringing it to the new
[18:02] testament and we'll touch on that just a
[18:04] little bit
[18:05] out of isaiah neither by the blood of
[18:07] goats and calves but by his own blood
[18:09] he entered him once into the holy place
[18:11] having obtained eternal redemption
[18:14] for us let's read first john 4 verse 16.
[18:17] i still hadn't gotten away and we really
[18:20] had a good time we
[18:21] we kind of weaved in a little bit of
[18:22] this eternal redemption in the
[18:25] service we were speaking on who is
[18:27] worthy how that we come from where we're
[18:29] not worthy in revelations 5 about verse
[18:31] 1 and 2 to where
[18:32] revelations 10 were kings and priests so
[18:34] somewhere we became worthy
[18:36] amen that's the same thing with this
[18:38] eternal redemption
[18:40] there wasn't a time in the mind of god
[18:42] that we weren't
[18:43] worthy you hear what i said in the mind
[18:46] of god the eternal part
[18:48] the genesis 1 26 always was eternal that
[18:52] genesis 1 26
[18:53] never had a a bad day never was lost but
[18:56] we got lost
[18:59] and then that genesis 1 26 brother bryan
[19:02] said you heard from your theophany
[19:04] you heard from that genesis 1 26 man and
[19:06] then you connected to that genesis 1 26
[19:09] man
[19:09] and that made you worthy because if he's
[19:12] worthy you're worthy
[19:14] as we were speaking before heirs and
[19:15] joint heirs with christ
[19:17] and then john first there in the book of
[19:19] john where jesus says
[19:20] lord i pray that we be one as me and you
[19:24] are one i pray to us
[19:25] and the people on the earth be one or
[19:28] his children be one and we are one
[19:31] but he had to pray the prayer of
[19:32] intercession that's what we're going to
[19:34] get into
[19:35] sunday there's an interceding there by
[19:37] prayer
[19:38] that we have to have but remember one
[19:40] thing let me throw you a little thought
[19:42] prayer is not eternal
[19:45] we won't pray when we get to the new
[19:46] city there'll be nothing to pray for
[19:49] when we take a glorified body there's
[19:51] nothing for us to pray for
[19:53] it's done it's finished but it's put
[19:55] there though for a temporary because
[19:57] remember in the bible
[20:00] i'm going to start on sunday service in
[20:02] the bible though adam spoke to god lip
[20:04] to ear face to face right
[20:06] but then the bible tells us that when
[20:08] seth was born
[20:09] then man began to call on the name of
[20:12] the lord that's when prayer comes
[20:14] and being instituted all right so just
[20:15] keep that in your mind for this weekend
[20:18] and we have known and believed the love
[20:19] that god has to us
[20:21] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[20:23] dwelleth in god and god in him
[20:25] hearing there's our love made perfect
[20:28] see our love is not perfect i feel your
[20:30] love but
[20:31] we're if you have the baptism of the
[20:32] holy ghost you have agape love amen
[20:34] which is perfect because he is so we in
[20:37] this world
[20:38] there is no fear in love a perfect love
[20:40] casteth out fear
[20:42] because fear has torment he that feareth
[20:43] is not made perfect in love
[20:45] we love him because he first loved us we
[20:47] couldn't be lovable
[20:48] we wouldn't know how to love without him
[20:49] being inside of us showing us how to
[20:52] love
[20:52] if a man say i love god and hate us his
[20:54] brother he's a liar for he that loveth
[20:56] not his brother whom he has seen
[20:57] how can he love god whom he hath not
[20:59] seen you may be seated in the lord at
[21:00] his blessing
[21:02] to the reading of the word now let's go
[21:03] ahead and continue with ephesians one
[21:05] and get these scriptures read not to get
[21:08] them out of the way but to
[21:09] to make sure that we stu we've got our
[21:11] background
[21:14] in ephesians four says according he has
[21:15] chosen us in him
[21:17] before the foundation of the world this
[21:19] whole plan hinged on
[21:21] that it was over before it got started
[21:24] it was over before it got started in the
[21:26] mind of god but
[21:28] in order for it to be a plan
[21:31] something had to happen for it to be a
[21:34] plan
[21:35] it's like brother brown said he said now
[21:36] that's why you see that we we've harped
[21:38] so much on for
[21:39] knowledge and on predestination because
[21:42] if it was just you know signed sealed
[21:44] and delivered
[21:46] why would he why would we need to fall
[21:47] why didn't he just bring us here the way
[21:49] we are
[21:50] no he had attributes that he had to
[21:51] display there was a part of god that was
[21:54] not known and that was a savior
[21:58] so in order for someone to have a savior
[22:02] as brother whis read that quote several
[22:04] weeks ago he had to become flesh
[22:08] to save us or to redeem us because the
[22:11] blood of bulls and goats we know can't
[22:12] take away sin
[22:13] it only covered sin but we know that
[22:16] he's according it has chosen us in him
[22:17] before the foundation of the world
[22:19] look that we should be holy and without
[22:21] blame before him in love that's what i
[22:22] was trying to get the people over there
[22:23] to see
[22:24] that you know what the devil's going to
[22:26] beat you we know that the devil that's
[22:28] his job he's never going to
[22:29] listen he's never going to not be around
[22:32] you
[22:34] he's not going to take a vacation
[22:38] but as long as he's here i like what
[22:41] brother schrader said many years ago he
[22:43] said all right devil if you're going to
[22:44] play around in my mind
[22:45] and you're going to look through my eyes
[22:47] we going to read the bible
[22:49] amen we go we're going to read the bible
[22:52] that's the best way to get rid of the
[22:53] devil start reading the bible
[22:55] start praying start reading the message
[22:57] of the hour he hates this bible he hates
[22:59] this word of god
[23:01] because he says look he sees this he
[23:03] says hmm holy and without blame
[23:06] before him in love ah why they do this
[23:08] and they do that and they have these bad
[23:10] thoughts and they have this this and
[23:11] they have their that and their death
[23:12] that's all he is is accuser of the
[23:14] brethren he but what is he accusing you
[23:16] for
[23:17] nothing that god sees that's why i want
[23:20] you to see we have been made
[23:22] worthy by the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:25] and not more worthy as we go up the
[23:27] statue of perfect man but it
[23:29] is more of god being closer to us
[23:33] than he's ever been close to anybody
[23:35] before you say even paul even
[23:37] i'm just saying i believe paul was
[23:41] was up that pyramid because he had a lot
[23:42] of things but now he never had
[23:45] the body change that you and i are
[23:47] looking to
[23:48] and we're looking at the body change and
[23:50] we're looking at something that no one
[23:53] even jesus didn't have a body change
[23:55] without death
[23:56] so see we're looking at this and but
[23:59] we're never going to get anywhere
[24:01] if we can't believe what he's already
[24:03] said
[24:05] that we should be holy and without blame
[24:07] before him in love
[24:09] all right having predestinated us into
[24:11] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[24:13] i was telling them over there i said
[24:14] look first thing you got to do is
[24:17] know that you're a child of god you've
[24:20] got to get in the family first
[24:23] that's our problem not ours but a lot of
[24:25] people's problems they say i'm in the
[24:26] message and i
[24:27] i think i'm you know it's kind of like
[24:30] the
[24:31] the cousin you had never met before
[24:32] comes to church you know
[24:34] and then they just start showing up a
[24:35] little more and a little more well you
[24:37] know you need to be in the family
[24:40] you need to be sons and daughters of god
[24:42] heading toward adoption
[24:46] whether you're there or not that's okay
[24:48] but heading toward it
[24:50] we have so we god is in motion
[24:55] like some of y'all are not this don't
[25:00] excite you i don't know what's going to
[25:01] make you happy
[25:06] having predestinated us into the
[25:07] adoption of children so listen
[25:09] he's going to have a bride he is going
[25:12] to have a family
[25:12] listen genesis 1 26 prove that he's
[25:15] going to have a family
[25:17] now and then there's a plan that's woven
[25:19] into that to know that we were
[25:21] he knew we were going to fall and he
[25:24] knew that he was going to redeem us back
[25:26] to that place not another place
[25:30] brother brown said redemption is not
[25:31] replacement but if you drop
[25:33] this on the ground and it was right here
[25:36] and you drop it on the ground and you
[25:38] put it over here that's not replacement
[25:40] right that's just putting it in another
[25:42] place
[25:43] you got to bring it back to where he
[25:45] said
[25:48] let us create man in our own image
[25:53] that's what we got to see see everybody
[25:56] else
[25:56] you know you may be redeemed but you may
[25:58] be over here somewhere
[26:00] we got to get redeemed back to where we
[26:01] started from amen
[26:04] i agree with i agree with the message of
[26:06] the hour you always was eternal
[26:09] but there was a time you were not
[26:12] or this plan doesn't work in order for
[26:16] this plan to work
[26:17] somebody had to be lost
[26:20] somebody had to fall look in verse
[26:24] 7 in whom we have redemption through his
[26:25] blood why'd he come and do all he did
[26:28] with it
[26:28] and and then we just don't need it
[26:30] because we always was
[26:33] no we needed that man we needed that god
[26:37] to become flesh
[26:38] to create a blood cell as we're going to
[26:39] read here in just a minute
[26:41] he made his own blessing to make sure
[26:44] that the plan was going to work
[26:48] he was the plan but you and i are the
[26:51] ones that are connected to it
[26:53] amen but now remember though as we were
[26:55] talking about sunday
[26:57] remember at the quote i read you where
[26:59] brother mom said now jesus didn't come
[27:00] down here to bring you your inheritance
[27:03] does everybody understand what brother
[27:04] i'm saying because what's happening is
[27:06] is he goes on in in the uh in the quote
[27:10] because i've met people that said that
[27:12] jesus
[27:13] that god of course they were
[27:14] trinitarians god sent jesus to earth
[27:18] makes to see if somebody feels sorry for
[27:20] him
[27:21] and he died for them because they're
[27:23] going to feel sorry for him
[27:25] well now brother brown said i wouldn't
[27:26] run my business like that and god don't
[27:28] run his business like that
[27:29] he came down here to get who he'd
[27:31] already sworn you
[27:32] but he had to come down here because the
[27:34] bible says he was a lamb slain before
[27:36] the foundation of the world
[27:38] and he was slain for the whole world
[27:41] but there's only a group of people in
[27:44] john 17 that's why i like john 17 that's
[27:46] our prayer because he's praying for his
[27:48] kids
[27:48] he's not praying for the devil's kids
[27:50] he's not praying for the world
[27:52] that's what he said he said i'm not
[27:53] praying for the world he said i'm
[27:54] praying for the ones that are in the
[27:56] world
[27:57] amen because we're in this world
[28:00] and then we have redemption through his
[28:02] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[28:04] to the riches of his grace
[28:06] wherein he has abounded toward us in all
[28:08] wisdom and prudence
[28:09] look having made known unto us the
[28:11] mystery of his will
[28:14] talk to people outside they're the most
[28:17] confused people in the world i mean from
[28:19] christians all the way down to centers
[28:21] this whole world's got them confused
[28:24] come out of a kobe 19 and survive that
[28:28] now you can't get out of the house cause
[28:29] you can't drive a car you ain't gonna
[28:30] gas
[28:34] the devil's like a pinball he's bouncing
[28:36] us all around everywhere
[28:40] i don't like being a pinball amen
[28:44] having made known under that's the
[28:45] mystery of his will well listen when
[28:47] we're going to start
[28:47] realizing that we're not we're not
[28:49] becoming worthy we're already worthy if
[28:51] you got the baptism of the holy ghost
[28:53] and like i said before use what you
[28:55] already got
[28:57] and if you don't got it get it that's
[28:59] pretty simple
[29:01] if you don't got it get it and once you
[29:04] get it i was reading a quote just a few
[29:05] minutes ago
[29:06] brother bob said the reason your prayer
[29:07] life's off the reason all these things
[29:09] are off in your life
[29:11] he said get the baptism of the holy
[29:12] ghost he said it will change your life
[29:19] i was listening to you all sunday and
[29:21] brother dale brother bob
[29:22] wonderful job always but i heard
[29:26] all the clapping well i guess y'all
[29:28] don't want to say a man loud enough and
[29:30] shout and praise the lord so you just
[29:32] let your hands be happy
[29:34] and that's okay as long as you make some
[29:35] kind of noise it keeps some of you awake
[29:40] yes and then we have redemption through
[29:42] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[29:44] according to look to the riches of his
[29:45] grace
[29:46] having made known unto us the mystery of
[29:48] his will let's go down to verse 10
[29:49] then in the dispensation of the fullness
[29:51] of times i want you to really get this
[29:53] before we go any further
[29:54] this is for you and you only right when
[29:57] brother branham stood there in
[29:59] in 1963 and preaching the seals he said
[30:02] this is for
[30:02] my people only he was not just saying
[30:06] the people that were sitting in that
[30:07] congregation
[30:08] because he had just told them before
[30:10] about a year later or year before in the
[30:13] seals
[30:14] that it's not even for you but they got
[30:17] a blanket
[30:18] let me put it this way they got a grace
[30:19] of marriage and divorce
[30:22] for the people that were there we
[30:23] understand that but it's not for the
[30:24] whole world
[30:26] he said these are to my followers only
[30:27] well this message is to
[30:29] to the followers of brother adam alone
[30:32] it's not to anybody else they can't
[30:33] understand us
[30:35] they and i was talking to somebody the
[30:37] other day
[30:38] um it wasn't us talking to him but
[30:40] anyway we were talking about something i
[30:42] said you know they can accept
[30:44] a prophet that they call the prophet the
[30:46] world calls a prophet john hagee and all
[30:48] the different ones and i'm going to call
[30:49] names because they're
[30:50] they can be christian people nominal
[30:53] christian people
[30:54] benny hen all these different ones they
[30:55] re revere him and they listen to his
[30:57] tapes and they watch his sermons
[30:59] and they read his literature
[31:02] but when you say god's saying that's the
[31:03] prophet william brown don't
[31:06] like you know why because he's not like
[31:09] those other ones
[31:11] he's out of the norm all these others
[31:14] like joel osteen doesn't preach on sin
[31:17] no wonder he's got 15 000 people if you
[31:19] quit preaching on sin
[31:20] everybody's going to come to church
[31:25] but they listen to him and they revere
[31:27] him and they talk they put his name up
[31:29] on
[31:29] you know on a pedestal but when we talk
[31:32] about god sending us a
[31:33] a word prophet right out of the bible
[31:37] right out of the bible they go no
[31:40] no no it's he just wasn't he might have
[31:43] been okay but he got wrong
[31:45] and you know why because his doctrine
[31:46] was different
[31:48] all the mother doctrines are pretty much
[31:49] you can put them all in a in a soup bowl
[31:52] and
[31:52] and uh yeah put them in a box
[31:56] it kind of reminds me remember when
[31:58] elisha met those sons of the prophets
[32:01] they had went out and collected some
[32:03] what wild gourds
[32:05] some wild doctrines
[32:09] and they come back in and said man this
[32:10] is it this is let's eat this right here
[32:13] let's eat this word because it's gonna
[32:15] and elijah walks in and goes if you eat
[32:17] that it's gonna kill you
[32:20] so we had an elijah in this day to come
[32:22] and he throw some meal into the pot
[32:25] what my pot in your pot to get us out of
[32:27] those denominational ideas
[32:29] so that we can live and that pot will
[32:32] sustain us and not kill us
[32:34] because we were dying out there in the
[32:36] world we were dying out there in the
[32:38] denominations
[32:40] that in the dispensation the fullness of
[32:42] times he might gather together in one
[32:44] all things in christ
[32:45] both which are in heaven which on earth
[32:46] even in him and him also we have
[32:48] obtained an inheritance
[32:50] well it doesn't sound like we just got
[32:52] something
[32:54] we inherited we haven't
[32:57] obtained you got to go get it
[33:01] you had to john john said give me the
[33:03] book
[33:04] give me the book angel you can't have it
[33:06] got to give it to me
[33:08] amen being predestinated according to
[33:11] the purpose of him that worketh all
[33:13] things after the council
[33:14] of his own will let's read quote number
[33:16] one tell me my brother tell me my sister
[33:18] when was the time that the sons of god
[33:19] was ever to be manifested outside of
[33:21] this time now
[33:22] when were there ever was a time in
[33:24] history that the manifest the time to
[33:26] deliver all nature
[33:28] nature the nature itself is groaning
[33:30] waiting for the time of manifestation
[33:32] why before the atonement was made before
[33:34] the holy ghost was ever poured out
[33:36] before all the old testament you see
[33:38] right there brother brown tells us it
[33:40] wasn't any holy ghost poured out in the
[33:41] old testament
[33:42] and no new birth now the holy ghost was
[33:44] anointing the people but they weren't
[33:45] heading on your birth
[33:47] on down there there couldn't have been
[33:49] manifestation
[33:51] it had to wait till this time now all
[33:53] things now look
[33:54] you think brother branham have you not
[33:56] ever read exodus
[34:00] talk about manifestation
[34:04] god took a nation bigger than the united
[34:07] states and drove them to their knees
[34:09] with manifestation of the power of god
[34:12] he's not talking about that kind of
[34:13] manifestation
[34:15] he's talking about manifestation of the
[34:17] word of god
[34:18] in a group of people not just anointed
[34:20] because look he brings in this little
[34:22] word
[34:23] it had to wait till this time now all
[34:25] things has been brought coming
[34:26] shaping up to a headstone
[34:30] there's your body changed the rest of
[34:32] them didn't have that
[34:33] to the manifestation of sons and god
[34:35] coming back and the spirit of god coming
[34:38] into these men
[34:39] not one man these men so perfectly until
[34:42] their ministry
[34:43] will be so close like christ so they'll
[34:45] join him and his church together amen
[34:47] amen wow it'll join what back to that
[34:51] genesis 1 26 man
[34:53] where adam and eve were literally one
[34:55] person
[34:57] and god and adam was one person
[35:01] god and adam and eve was one person
[35:05] and that's what he was praying in john
[35:06] 17 that
[35:08] they the bride be one
[35:11] as you and my father are one now how
[35:13] many is that there's only one god
[35:16] and the manifestation of god in the end
[35:18] time is the bride
[35:20] so we're totally a part of this plan
[35:24] outside of everything else just like i
[35:26] said before this is just to the bride
[35:29] we're the only ones now brother brown
[35:31] said we're the only ones that'll have
[35:32] perfect love
[35:33] we're the only ones that we have his
[35:35] potential
[35:37] right and we will do his will we will do
[35:39] what the bible says
[35:41] we will do what and i don't say we'll do
[35:43] what the message says because that's
[35:44] killed a lot of people doing just what
[35:46] the message says
[35:49] let's do what the word of god says it
[35:50] will direct us to the message
[35:52] amen if we'll get that right to start
[35:54] with we'll get born again
[35:56] get the people to christ get make sure
[35:59] you're justified make sure you're
[36:00] sanctified
[36:01] make sure you're filled with the holy
[36:03] ghost not just have an anointing of this
[36:05] message
[36:07] because an anointing of this message is
[36:08] just going to kill you
[36:10] look at these people that's been
[36:11] preaching we were talking about this
[36:12] sunday 30 or 40 years people have been
[36:14] preaching
[36:15] with a true anointing because they
[36:18] preached truth
[36:20] some of them preached good truth
[36:23] but somewhere they didn't go all the way
[36:26] that anointing is going to have to lift
[36:28] off of them
[36:30] eventually but listen with me and you as
[36:33] the bride of jesus christ that anointing
[36:34] never lifts off of us
[36:36] that's what's going to change our body
[36:38] that's what's going to take us in a
[36:40] rapture
[36:41] is that anointing that is on us which is
[36:43] the headstone anointing
[36:45] that no one else has got jesus was the
[36:48] headstone
[36:49] we are the anointing of the headstone
[36:52] which makes us still won
[36:57] it's real simple we talk about headstone
[36:59] we talk about these different things you
[37:01] know
[37:01] maybe some of the young people don't
[37:02] understand but
[37:06] when you have a headstone some people
[37:09] think about headstones and
[37:10] having a gray on the grave but there's a
[37:13] headstone that
[37:14] and they call it the keystone or the
[37:15] headstone that the ark goes up and
[37:17] there's a stone that sits right up in
[37:18] the middle of that
[37:19] right man everybody got that and it's
[37:21] usually
[37:23] like a pyramid some of them upside down
[37:26] but
[37:26] anyway the door is held up basically by
[37:29] that they call it the keystone if you
[37:30] pull that thing out it collapses
[37:32] well see you and i we we know one
[37:34] thing's for sure paul and ireneus and
[37:36] all them
[37:37] they are part of that but the key to get
[37:41] them out of the ground
[37:43] is me and you the plan
[37:46] that we're talking about here that there
[37:47] is a generation
[37:49] that was cut off during the church ages
[37:53] and all you
[37:54] and and not be little no one folks we
[37:56] listen
[37:58] but they without us can't be made
[37:59] perfect whatever they got
[38:02] they're waiting on the last piece
[38:05] or they're waiting on the headstone we
[38:08] had a prophet come and bring us that
[38:10] headstone
[38:11] message the seven seals that told us all
[38:15] these things we couldn't
[38:16] listen how in the world can you we
[38:18] preach what we preach
[38:20] and not know have a background of the
[38:22] message of the hour
[38:24] you're just presuming you're just out
[38:26] talking right
[38:28] because where are you going to take
[38:29] clarence larkin who you going to take
[38:30] you're going to take john hagee
[38:32] he's pretty good john mccarthy he's
[38:33] pretty good guy i like to listen to him
[38:35] i just
[38:36] i admit it he's got some good points
[38:39] but he's not the one i listen to
[38:44] to get what i listen to with a message
[38:47] amen
[38:48] because they do have some good points
[38:49] clarence locker must have some pretty
[38:51] good points because brother brown used
[38:52] some of his points
[38:53] he used some of scofield's points but
[38:55] see there's a piece missing in their
[38:56] message
[38:58] the piece of scofield that's missing in
[39:00] the message was he's a trinitarian
[39:01] so that knocked him out of any of the
[39:03] headstone message
[39:05] everybody got that that not john hagee
[39:08] and all the different ones they're all
[39:09] trinitarians
[39:10] so they have a brother they have a loose
[39:13] end
[39:14] or they have a flaw that can't get them
[39:17] connected like you and i are connected
[39:20] because jesus was the connection and i
[39:23] just read you a quote where brother
[39:25] brown said
[39:26] these men so perfect till their massive
[39:28] message will be so close like christ
[39:31] till it'll join him and his church
[39:32] together
[39:34] and that was the opening of the seals
[39:36] but now see but then when once the old
[39:38] book note once the seals were open
[39:40] you got 14 different versions of what
[39:42] the seventh seal is
[39:45] polygamy we're already in the millennium
[39:47] do whatever you want to because we're
[39:48] you know
[39:49] it doesn't matter what this guy does oh
[39:52] come on people
[39:54] it don't matter what this thing does but
[39:56] you're gonna show what's inside of there
[39:57] that's making that thing do what it's
[39:59] doing
[39:59] amen that's what we're looking at
[40:03] it's the inside guy that makes the
[40:05] outside guy work
[40:07] look at number two how can i take a
[40:08] huckleberry and make a grain of wheat
[40:10] out of it it's impossible for me to do
[40:12] it
[40:12] the only way it's because inside that
[40:14] kuckerberg has been transmitted from a
[40:15] cuckoo bird
[40:17] to a germ called wheat life then you
[40:20] bury that cocker burn it'll produce a
[40:21] grain of wheat that's right because
[40:22] there has been a life of wheat put
[40:24] in that cucumber i want us to get that
[40:27] down
[40:28] you have to have eternal life
[40:31] given to you down here in these first
[40:34] three dimensions
[40:36] before you get born again you can't get
[40:39] born again without your
[40:41] soul being burnt out
[40:44] that new nature put in burn your nature
[40:47] out and
[40:47] and then the bible tells us that we're a
[40:50] new creation
[40:52] we're a new creature brother brown uses
[40:54] the word vulcanize
[40:57] are you vulcanized you can't be wood and
[41:00] rubber
[41:01] and vulcanized so what vulcanizes you
[41:05] saying well i'm just a sinner
[41:07] yeah but before the foundation of the
[41:08] world god cut a piece of that tire
[41:11] off and he preserved that piece of that
[41:14] tire
[41:14] you came down here with a hole in it
[41:20] i know you went with and you were flat
[41:24] right you loved the world and the things
[41:26] of the world but god had that patch
[41:28] ready for you
[41:29] so he could bring it down to you and
[41:31] guess what fire
[41:33] puts them two together and then you
[41:35] cannot separate them because you take
[41:37] rubber
[41:37] you take genesis 1 26 you take the
[41:40] theophany of god
[41:41] and you put him in yours and you seal it
[41:43] together
[41:46] and god listen god can't even pull it
[41:49] apart
[41:53] oh that's what makes me happy god can't
[41:55] even pull it apart
[41:56] much less the stinky old devil
[42:01] he heard me say that
[42:05] but we live in these first three
[42:07] dimensions we have to because jesus even
[42:09] tells us in john 17
[42:11] i don't have it there just i'm going to
[42:12] try to quote it he says in other words i
[42:14] don't want to take them out of this
[42:15] world that would be too easy
[42:18] he said but i'm going to pray for him
[42:19] that they'll stay in this world
[42:21] but in other words be preserved because
[42:23] you know what jesus was almighty god he
[42:25] was walking around in a pretty sinful
[42:26] place
[42:27] amen that's the same way me and you
[42:29] we're walking around in a sinful place
[42:31] and we're god almighty and human flesh
[42:34] hello we're god almighty and human flesh
[42:37] not going to be
[42:39] we are we've just got to realize wake
[42:42] that thing up
[42:44] listen there's a butterfly in there
[42:46] somewhere
[42:49] but you gotta die caterpillar
[42:53] you gotta die caterpillar and then you
[42:55] gotta do what
[42:58] free virtue knowledge
[43:01] right oh let's get wait a minute please
[43:03] temper
[43:05] temp come on home come on come and help
[43:06] me temper
[43:08] patience godliness but you know what
[43:11] when that butterfly works its way out
[43:13] my little bees they told us a long time
[43:15] ago they said do not help those bees
[43:18] and you know what you're not supposed to
[43:19] help a chicken or anything come out of
[43:20] its shell you're supposed to let it peck
[43:22] its way out
[43:24] the bees are stronger and live longer
[43:26] when they peck their self
[43:27] or eat their way out of their cocoon
[43:30] or their sh cell or shell same way with
[43:34] anything that's the same way with me and
[43:35] you
[43:36] we got to have trials we got to have
[43:38] tribulations we got to have
[43:39] things in this life light time and
[43:41] matter that's not going to matter when
[43:43] we get done with this thing
[43:45] amen the devil it's just going to all be
[43:48] burned up
[43:51] amen but we have to live here to what
[43:55] for a testimony it's part of the plan
[44:01] and then he give us a fourth dimension
[44:02] of science and the tree of knowledge of
[44:04] good and evil the fifth dimension we
[44:05] know where that is that's hell
[44:07] but it's not burning remember it's not a
[44:08] burning place it is a place of judgment
[44:11] waiting judgment thank god we don't have
[44:14] to do that
[44:15] amen have you ever really just sat down
[44:18] and thought about and you
[44:19] read in revelations what's going to
[44:20] happen that men
[44:22] and women are going to literally cry for
[44:25] the
[44:25] rocks to fall on them to die and they
[44:28] can't
[44:29] right and that birds will eat your flesh
[44:32] while you're still alive
[44:34] i'm not trying to scare you in to be a
[44:35] christian i'm just telling you what's up
[44:37] what you're going to be up against
[44:38] if you don't make this thing and i'm not
[44:41] telling you a fable it's in the bible
[44:43] amen it's in the bible that's what's
[44:45] going to happen after we leave after the
[44:48] grace of god is gone from this place
[44:50] and what is the grace of god we're going
[44:52] to get into that the bride is the grace
[44:54] of god
[44:55] millions of people are going to get
[44:56] eternal life just because you walked in
[44:58] front of them
[45:00] just because you were what part of their
[45:02] economy
[45:04] and they were good to you they're going
[45:06] to get eternal life just because of that
[45:10] besides all the other besides all the
[45:13] spiritual birth that brother dale's give
[45:14] us all
[45:18] yeah you gotta have a pastor didn't it
[45:19] did somebody preach on that sunday i
[45:21] think
[45:22] somewhere we gotta have a pastor
[45:27] and he's the one to lead us through amen
[45:31] i was talking to the guy
[45:34] last night when we came back from
[45:35] illinois
[45:37] he's trying to be a nominal christian
[45:39] the guy that we that we uh
[45:41] live in his man cave um
[45:44] and we hunt up there brett just
[45:46] remembering your prayer he's having a
[45:47] battle but he's trying to be good he's
[45:50] like kind of like jim's dad he's trying
[45:52] to
[45:53] good his way into heaven you can't do
[45:56] that
[45:58] you can't do that the rich young ruler
[46:01] rich
[46:02] rich young ruler
[46:06] he didn't make it but now look i told
[46:09] brett i said look you can be a good
[46:10] samaritan that's fine
[46:12] but i said if you're a christian you're
[46:13] a sheep and sheep is a hurt animal
[46:17] and listen what happens when the sheep
[46:20] gets away from the herd
[46:22] that's the first one that the wolves
[46:25] we've seen it many times you watch those
[46:26] national
[46:27] geographic the slowest one the sick
[46:30] the sickly one and the one they can cut
[46:32] out from the herd
[46:33] becomes food for the nation for the for
[46:36] the coyotes or the jackals or whatever
[46:37] you want
[46:38] that's the same way with god with god
[46:40] you stay in the herd
[46:42] but you get out away from the herd the
[46:44] devil's the first one is going to pick
[46:45] you up
[46:47] listen we need to be together
[46:51] we need we're herd animals we're sheep
[46:53] we have to have a what
[46:54] a shepherd sure you say well i've got
[46:56] god i can stay home
[46:58] now that's not what the bible said you
[47:00] got to go back to the plan
[47:02] the plan says we need a five-fold
[47:04] ministry and a pastor to lead us or a
[47:07] shepherd to take that hook every once in
[47:09] a while and
[47:10] pull us back in amen
[47:14] but he does it by this next thing he
[47:16] does it by what perfect love
[47:17] we talked about paradise we know what
[47:19] happened there but perfect love
[47:20] brother brown he went across the curtain
[47:22] of time this is perfect
[47:24] love that's god love god's love
[47:27] isn't that what you spoke the holy ghost
[47:29] was i said yes this is perfect love
[47:31] let's go to number four
[47:33] now watch the first is perfect love
[47:34] that's god love pure and unadulterated
[47:36] the next coming there is filial love
[47:38] see see god give us filial love
[47:42] to be in the first three dimensions and
[47:44] be able to live and love and have a
[47:46] family
[47:46] love your wife love your kids love your
[47:49] most of your in-laws and most of your
[47:51] relatives
[47:54] no the bible says we need to love the
[47:56] ones that hate us okay
[47:57] okay i'm gonna read it sunday it says
[48:00] pray for those who
[48:02] despise you wow
[48:05] despise you the first is perfect love
[48:08] that's god love pure adultery the next
[48:10] comes in there is filial love that's
[48:11] love that you have for your wife and
[48:12] your children
[48:13] the next drop after that is lustful love
[48:15] the next is ungodly love and just goes
[48:17] on down till it's filth
[48:19] just keeps on perverting perverting now
[48:20] remember but we go back the other way
[48:23] and if you have agape love you can't
[48:25] have agape love without
[48:26] not having the new birth but now watch
[48:29] let's go to number six
[48:30] go through here real quick from that
[48:33] time in in
[48:34] oregon brother brown said look i'll say
[48:37] this with the faith that i have in that
[48:38] vision he's talking about going across
[48:40] the curtain of time whatever it was i'll
[48:41] speak in the name of the lord
[48:43] except you have that perfect love you'll
[48:45] never be there
[48:47] because nothing could ever be there
[48:48] without it your spirit would be out of
[48:51] place there
[48:54] and that's why that's what i tell you
[48:55] happens in a church service
[48:57] you don't need to have discernment just
[48:59] start preaching the word of god
[49:02] and you'll watch people squirm and then
[49:03] they'll do this and then they'll
[49:05] then they'll try to go outside and
[49:07] they'll try to get away from it why
[49:08] there's an anointing there that's going
[49:10] out and it's beating up against that
[49:12] what
[49:12] that other spirit that's here
[49:16] amen but what spirit wins
[49:21] the one you let win the one you that win
[49:25] is the one that wins
[49:27] what what the chief saying now in me
[49:28] black dog white dog that's even being
[49:30] after being a christian you're still
[49:32] sitting there
[49:32] and you're fighting white dog black dog
[49:35] black dog sleep
[49:36] white dog awake
[49:42] amen
[49:44] anyway let's go to number eight
[49:48] it's that anointed anointed with the
[49:50] real spirit see that holy spirit can
[49:51] fall upon a man in his spirit
[49:53] but his soul is his germ that germ is
[49:55] the word
[49:56] see and how i don't care how much you
[49:58] can preach how well you do this and how
[50:00] much you love there's
[50:02] that's one of the inlets to spirit you
[50:05] can't love with your body
[50:06] you love with your spirit that's one of
[50:09] the inlets and you can love and even
[50:11] love
[50:12] god and still not be listen you can't
[50:15] you can't love god with agape love
[50:18] without having that agape love already
[50:21] inside you
[50:24] i'm not going to say that again i might
[50:25] be able to say it but
[50:27] without a god be love it's just filial
[50:29] love and there's a lot of people
[50:31] sit in this message and love god in
[50:33] their spirit
[50:35] it's showing look but the bible tells us
[50:38] even when we talk about what we want the
[50:39] manifestation of the sons of god we want
[50:41] the manifestation of the word
[50:42] well comes the manifestation of the word
[50:44] and manifestation of the sons of god
[50:46] is going to push the other ones out
[50:48] because they're going to be manifested
[50:50] also
[50:53] whatever spirit they have whatever
[50:55] spirit we have
[50:57] is going to manifest itself because
[50:59] listen you're not going to carry
[51:02] an evil spirit to that next dimension
[51:05] that we're going to the sixth dimension
[51:07] if you pass away
[51:08] or even if they come here in this
[51:09] dimension then we go back to that
[51:10] dimension with a body change
[51:13] like i said before your spirit's got to
[51:16] be familiar
[51:17] do we walk in church and do we do we
[51:20] pray do we read our bible because our
[51:22] spirit is familiar with that act
[51:25] or is it uncomfortable for us to read
[51:29] our bible
[51:30] and to study the word of god is it
[51:31] uncomfortable for us to come to church
[51:35] am i talking to somebody is it
[51:37] uncomfortable for us to come to church
[51:40] it should be the most comfortable place
[51:42] listen this should be a place to where
[51:44] when that priest walked into that holy
[51:46] of holies and that
[51:48] i could i can hear it i can hear that
[51:49] curtain go
[51:51] and he's standing in a place with nobody
[51:54] but him and god
[51:55] amen nobody but him and god he's
[51:59] he's he and he's standing there on the
[52:02] foundation that everything god had told
[52:05] him to do that he did it
[52:07] because if one thing was wrong he wasn't
[52:09] in there very long
[52:11] they had to drag him out and send
[52:13] another one in but there you're in the
[52:15] shekinah glory well now what about
[52:16] what about now folks that's your kind of
[52:18] glory's not you don't have to go into it
[52:21] if you're born again you're already in
[52:23] it you're just living in the shekinah
[52:25] glory you're living in the
[52:26] the curtain falling behind you and it's
[52:29] you and god alone
[52:34] let's read number nine real quick i
[52:36] shortened this one down perfect faith
[52:37] brother brown said real genuine love
[52:39] will create
[52:40] a confidence in his word
[52:44] see now we tell we we say well now
[52:47] that was i hope john hagee doesn't hear
[52:49] me because he's a pretty nice guy
[52:50] but if john haley was to say this they'd
[52:52] print it in the book
[52:53] they'd put it all over the country and
[52:55] then the voice of the martyr or
[52:56] somewhere boy john hagee said real
[52:58] genuine love will create a confidence in
[52:59] his word
[53:00] but if you say william brown said that
[53:01] let's go okay
[53:05] to me that just sums everything up right
[53:08] real genuine what agape love will create
[53:12] a confidence in his word
[53:16] listen folks that's the only thing's
[53:17] going to get us out of here it's the
[53:19] confidence in what's already been wrote
[53:21] i think the problem is
[53:23] is we're waiting for something new to
[53:24] happen we're waiting for some new book
[53:27] or some new tape or some new
[53:29] book of maccabees is going to be
[53:31] authenticated by the prophet well no the
[53:33] prophet's gone
[53:35] he authenticated the bible 66 books of
[53:38] the bible we ain't got to hunt no other
[53:40] book nowhere else
[53:44] let's read number 10
[53:49] position of a believer in christ
[53:52] under the law under the shadow they
[53:53] entered in under the shed of shedding of
[53:55] blood of goats and bulls
[53:57] which we went through which could not
[53:58] take away sin i wish people could
[54:00] believe that and see that the
[54:02] the new birth that was known you birthed
[54:03] in the old testament to save those
[54:05] people
[54:06] because it was a life of an animal how
[54:08] can that little lamb's life
[54:11] listen if that little lamb's life come
[54:13] back in you
[54:14] yes what you do you go outside and eat
[54:16] grass and walk on all fours
[54:19] and man cause you're gonna be the life
[54:20] that's inside of you
[54:22] that's why we act like the devil because
[54:24] he's inside of us that's why we act like
[54:26] christ cause he's inside of us
[54:29] but the blood of bulls and goats
[54:30] couldn't make us act like that
[54:32] that's right that's pretty simple to me
[54:37] it was the life of an animal how could
[54:39] the life and spirit of a dead animal
[54:41] coming out of the blood of life the cell
[54:43] of life breaking forth the blood that
[54:45] was shed
[54:46] ever that life ever returned back into
[54:48] an animal
[54:49] or a man the life of a lamb a heifer
[54:53] goat or an animal that's been sacrificed
[54:56] that's our problem we get a spirit of a
[54:57] goat
[55:01] butt but but
[55:04] but it's been sacrificed after the blood
[55:07] has been broken for our sins look that's
[55:09] why it never returns back and having
[55:11] anything to do with a human being it
[55:12] could not
[55:13] but god before the foundation of the
[55:15] world foreordained that jesus would come
[55:17] the perfect lamb of god
[55:19] into a perfect cell that god himself
[55:21] created
[55:23] to bring blood into the world to offer
[55:25] that blood
[55:28] he brought his own blood listen
[55:31] he saw this plan to the end gloria
[55:34] and he acted it out because he's the one
[55:36] that wrote it he's the one that saw it
[55:39] so let's put our confidence in that and
[55:42] he keeps on going if you turn him down
[55:43] in this hour i don't want to get into
[55:44] that
[55:45] please don't turn him down but look the
[55:47] very nature of god is in you you're
[55:48] still subjected to mistakes
[55:51] but god can't see it
[55:54] because it's covered by his blood and
[55:56] when you it's covered by his blood it's
[55:58] not just covered it's eradicated
[56:01] amen because it's covered by the blood
[56:03] god can't see through the blood every
[56:04] time he looks through the blood
[56:06] it looks white he looks through the
[56:08] blood
[56:09] it looks white
[56:14] so now let's talk just a minute about
[56:18] let's pull the chart up just a second
[56:21] if you will brothers tada
[56:25] because here jesus christ thank you
[56:27] there you go that's for the older people
[56:29] the bigger fonts for the older ones just
[56:32] the laws don't laugh
[56:33] it'll happen if you just it'll what can
[56:36] you see that
[56:37] you can't see it honey we got some
[56:40] somebody got so hand her something
[56:42] don't we have some of these back here
[56:44] somewhere oh here we go you want one
[56:47] huh no well forget it then
[56:51] so anyway now you can see it now look
[56:53] they're making it bigger
[56:56] but look we come here and we know that
[56:59] this is life like
[57:00] matter but i want to show you something
[57:01] here here's jesus christ
[57:04] like i said he's the he's the the center
[57:07] of this whole plan right because this
[57:10] same man
[57:11] that we're going to talk about in just a
[57:12] minute in isaiah this same man
[57:16] was standing back here creating
[57:19] so he can't get it wrong there's no
[57:22] miscommunication
[57:24] our problem is we have miscommunication
[57:27] if i told brother dale something by the
[57:29] time he got back over here to brother
[57:30] zach it'd be
[57:31] zero what i said because we're humans we
[57:34] hear
[57:34] sometimes what we want to hear and so
[57:38] does god
[57:40] but he has the he has to go by what the
[57:42] word says
[57:43] because he wrote it so this same man
[57:45] that we're going to talk about that was
[57:47] and i tried to pull up a few scriptures
[57:49] but i mean my heavens
[57:51] if 400 scriptures were fulfilled just at
[57:53] the crucifixion
[57:55] how many other hundreds spoke of him
[57:57] coming right
[57:58] amen i have him getting here
[58:02] and the birth of jesus and the birth of
[58:04] this messiah the birth of this savior
[58:06] and then we're going to see in a few
[58:08] more weeks that
[58:11] 90 percent no 99 of the world didn't
[58:14] believe he was who he was
[58:15] right so here you weigh down to like one
[58:18] percent
[58:19] really believe that that was jesus
[58:21] christ
[58:22] now it got better as it went on down to
[58:24] the church ages but back this way
[58:26] right here from the birth of jesus to
[58:28] the death of jesus
[58:30] they didn't nobody believe who he was he
[58:33] had 12
[58:34] and one of them was the devil now surely
[58:37] he had 120 in the upper room but that
[58:39] was after he come back and went into the
[58:41] people
[58:44] how can you deny something when he's
[58:46] inside of you
[58:47] you can't deny it hey i didn't deny i
[58:50] had the devil inside of me
[58:51] you know why because i manifested
[58:53] exactly what he wanted me to manifest
[58:56] but now you see the creation and you see
[58:58] the seventh dimension which is eternity
[58:59] that the seventh dimension is up here
[59:02] but when man fell we came down here into
[59:06] time
[59:07] and so time is going to run all the way
[59:09] we're going to talk about it later but
[59:10] not now
[59:11] then you come down and raise this up
[59:12] just here thank you we see that now that
[59:14] death came abel was the first person to
[59:16] die and he was put into paradise
[59:19] everybody with me blood of animals
[59:21] covered sin
[59:22] did not eradicate it the two tables of
[59:24] stone were put in the ark and that's
[59:26] what
[59:27] that's what that brother brown said they
[59:29] died believing that the messiah was
[59:31] coming or that jehovah was coming
[59:33] but they didn't see it but they were
[59:35] believing
[59:37] many i got many uh scriptures in there
[59:39] that i was looking at today
[59:41] all those prophets when they all came
[59:43] they prayed
[59:46] they prayed moses prayed for the people
[59:48] elijah elisha
[59:50] nehemiah jeremiah all the different
[59:53] major prophets in the old testament
[59:55] they prayed for the people but what did
[59:58] they do when they prayed for the people
[1:00:00] the people killed him isaiah was a boy
[1:00:04] and they tore him completely asunder cut
[1:00:06] his legs off his arms off
[1:00:08] and everything because he was a prophet
[1:00:10] that's why jesus stood right here and
[1:00:12] she said
[1:00:14] i know why you don't believe me because
[1:00:16] you put them in the grave you're
[1:00:18] polishing isaiah's tomb and you're the
[1:00:20] one that put him in there
[1:00:22] what a bunch of hypocrites so here we go
[1:00:25] we go through time and we see that
[1:00:27] there was prophets all down through the
[1:00:29] ages and there were seven church ages in
[1:00:31] the old testament seven church ages in
[1:00:33] the new testament
[1:00:34] but remember the old testament was
[1:00:36] continued all the way down to here
[1:00:38] all the way down to pentecost so they
[1:00:40] got the old testament
[1:00:42] paradise was emptied out when jesus went
[1:00:44] and preached to the souls in hell but
[1:00:45] you know what happened
[1:00:46] he left them down here they didn't come
[1:00:48] out with him if you were down here those
[1:00:50] who turned god down in other words those
[1:00:52] who turned the atonement down who turned
[1:00:55] down
[1:00:56] the word of god for their time all right
[1:00:59] so they stayed down here jesus preached
[1:01:01] to the ones who turned god down
[1:01:03] and they're going to be there until the
[1:01:04] white throne judgment they're going to
[1:01:05] be dead for a long time
[1:01:07] so paradise was right here and then when
[1:01:09] jesus died he came down here
[1:01:11] he didn't empty none of this out he
[1:01:14] testified to him come back up here
[1:01:15] picked up paradise
[1:01:17] took it up man i like that
[1:01:21] can you move it with my finger and then
[1:01:24] the sixth dimension begins and that's
[1:01:25] what we've been talking about
[1:01:26] that's where the born-again believer
[1:01:28] this is where brother branham went into
[1:01:29] this sixth dimension
[1:01:31] where the first martyr was who stephen
[1:01:34] stephen was the first martyr and then
[1:01:36] all the ones that died after that
[1:01:37] they're in that sixth dimension
[1:01:39] but now you and i are still right here
[1:01:42] we're still in time
[1:01:44] but we believe that this man came the
[1:01:47] birth of jesus according to luke 2 7.
[1:01:50] but i want you to see something about
[1:01:52] that man
[1:01:53] remember jesus christ never had any
[1:01:55] children
[1:01:57] physical children but he could he was a
[1:02:00] man
[1:02:01] he was ever wet man but he was ever with
[1:02:03] god
[1:02:05] all right so let's listen leave that up
[1:02:06] if you don't mind
[1:02:09] isaiah 7 14 it says therefore the lord
[1:02:12] himself shall give you a sign
[1:02:14] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:02:16] a son
[1:02:17] and shall call his name emmanuel matthew
[1:02:20] 1 verse 19
[1:02:21] then joseph her husband being a just man
[1:02:23] and not willing to make her a public
[1:02:25] example was minded to put her away
[1:02:26] privately
[1:02:27] but while he thought on these things
[1:02:28] behold the angel the lord appeared on
[1:02:30] him in a dream saying joseph thou son of
[1:02:32] david
[1:02:33] fear not to take unto thee marry thy
[1:02:34] wife for that which is conceived in her
[1:02:37] as of the holy ghost and i love brother
[1:02:38] brown uses that example he talks about
[1:02:41] people saying well who you know is give
[1:02:44] me your trinitarian idea well you got a
[1:02:46] father and a son and the holy ghost
[1:02:48] and you say well now wait a minute who's
[1:02:49] who was jesus's father
[1:02:51] well jesus said father what's the father
[1:02:52] dummy
[1:02:54] well brother i'm reading this reads this
[1:02:56] scripture right here and he says
[1:02:58] now the bible says that the holy ghost
[1:03:00] was his daddy
[1:03:01] right here says he was that which is
[1:03:03] conceived in her is of the holy ghost
[1:03:06] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[1:03:08] shalt call his name jesus for he shall
[1:03:10] save his savior's people
[1:03:11] from their sins and all this was done
[1:03:13] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:03:14] spoken by the lord by the prophet
[1:03:16] saying behold a virgin shall con be with
[1:03:18] child and bring forth a son
[1:03:20] and they shall call his name immanuel
[1:03:22] which being interpreted
[1:03:23] is god with us
[1:03:26] folks that was almighty god
[1:03:30] know we believe that but he was the very
[1:03:32] essence of god he's
[1:03:33] he's the very for three and a half years
[1:03:35] see we only got a three and a half year
[1:03:37] impact from this
[1:03:38] from this man sure he showed up at 13
[1:03:41] years old and he showed up at nine or he
[1:03:43] showed up at a little child
[1:03:44] somewhere but his message is what even
[1:03:47] all of christendom even all of the world
[1:03:50] that is part of christianity believes
[1:03:52] that that man somehow some way either
[1:03:54] being the second person of the trinity
[1:03:56] or being almighty god himself but that
[1:03:58] person had to come and die for us
[1:04:01] but now listen if he came as a second
[1:04:03] person then
[1:04:04] then he told us that he was going to
[1:04:08] send a comforter back
[1:04:13] and he's going to be sent in his name
[1:04:18] it is confusing to the scholars i'm sure
[1:04:21] but if you'll just take what god said he
[1:04:23] said right there
[1:04:24] he said i'm going to send a baby that's
[1:04:25] going to be born a virgin and he's going
[1:04:27] to be
[1:04:28] emmanuel god with us
[1:04:34] if he created his own body the egg
[1:04:37] and if he created his own blood the germ
[1:04:40] sperm
[1:04:41] and he put it in the womb of mary you
[1:04:43] see this plan
[1:04:44] cannot ever fail
[1:04:47] sometimes we may scratch our head about
[1:04:49] something that we do
[1:04:50] but god's not scratching his head he he
[1:04:52] wrote
[1:04:53] every how many hundreds of times in the
[1:04:55] old testament how he was going to come
[1:04:58] and then when he actually came they
[1:04:59] called him everything but almighty god
[1:05:02] and he said show me where i didn't come
[1:05:06] the way that the prophets told me
[1:05:08] and that's basically what they said they
[1:05:11] said well
[1:05:12] we have moses we have abraham
[1:05:16] who are you well let's read in isaiah
[1:05:19] 53.
[1:05:21] let's see what this guy did for us this
[1:05:23] commoner
[1:05:24] this man that spoke a common language
[1:05:27] this man that was
[1:05:30] an outcast to the regular world
[1:05:34] let's go and pull that up if you don't
[1:05:35] mind brothers isaiah 53.
[1:05:39] i preached the sermon years ago on who
[1:05:41] shall declare his generation so let's
[1:05:42] look at that and see
[1:05:44] because remember this man jesus see
[1:05:46] that's what the pharisees they were
[1:05:47] looking at a man that had never been
[1:05:49] married
[1:05:52] and he's sitting there declaring that
[1:05:53] he's going to have a church he's going
[1:05:55] to have a people he's going to have a
[1:05:56] bride
[1:05:57] he's going to have a group that's going
[1:05:59] to that's going to emanate from him
[1:06:01] that's going to come forth from him and
[1:06:03] he's
[1:06:03] and they're like you don't even have a
[1:06:05] wife
[1:06:07] they just didn't know he was creating
[1:06:08] his own wife
[1:06:11] hmm in the bride a wife
[1:06:15] he was creating his own wife it was just
[1:06:18] the secret coming
[1:06:20] it wasn't something that ma'am is going
[1:06:21] to look out because watch this right
[1:06:22] here
[1:06:25] who hath believed our report see they
[1:06:28] did not
[1:06:29] and to whom is the arm or the strength
[1:06:32] of the lord revealed
[1:06:34] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:06:36] tender plant he's talking about jesus
[1:06:38] christ
[1:06:39] and as a root now this is isaiah the one
[1:06:41] that killed when he was a little boy
[1:06:42] because
[1:06:42] they thought he was crazy and as a root
[1:06:45] out of a dry
[1:06:46] ground he has no form or commonness
[1:06:50] he didn't get up and do his hair every
[1:06:51] day may not took a bath every day
[1:06:53] he was a common man but he was almighty
[1:06:56] god
[1:06:58] you say what does god look like
[1:07:02] prophet told us that's the closest we're
[1:07:03] going to get at the moment amen
[1:07:07] listen to this because see there's two
[1:07:09] things that jesus did
[1:07:12] this man jesus
[1:07:15] number one he came in human flesh to be
[1:07:18] our brother
[1:07:20] to be our boaz
[1:07:24] but remember in the story of boaz
[1:07:26] there's a person in between all that
[1:07:28] right and that's the devil or that other
[1:07:31] kinsman
[1:07:31] that's closer that was closer than boaz
[1:07:35] so even god i hate to say this but it's
[1:07:38] the only way i'm determined is
[1:07:40] god had to bow himself down into human
[1:07:42] flesh
[1:07:43] and let the devil beat on him
[1:07:46] because he looked he was 50 years look
[1:07:48] 50 years old he was only 33 years old
[1:07:51] but listen to this but there was two
[1:07:53] things that this man did because he had
[1:07:55] a body
[1:07:56] and he had a soul everybody got that
[1:07:59] then we'll close was only 8 19. he had a
[1:08:02] body
[1:08:03] and he had a soul but now he couldn't
[1:08:06] give his body a ransom
[1:08:08] it was human
[1:08:12] that body can't come back on me in you
[1:08:19] we're his body but the literal body
[1:08:21] can't come back
[1:08:22] on me or you but he can do one thing he
[1:08:25] can do this right here
[1:08:27] listen to this we shall see and there's
[1:08:30] no beauty that we should desire him
[1:08:33] in other words he'd fit in in a crowd
[1:08:35] and you'd never know who he was
[1:08:39] he is despised and rejected of men that
[1:08:41] proved that even and now who rejected
[1:08:43] him and despised him the most the
[1:08:44] religious people of the world
[1:08:46] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[1:08:48] grief and we hid as it was our face from
[1:08:51] him and he was
[1:08:52] despised and we isaiah says we
[1:08:56] esteemed him not in other words the
[1:08:57] world said no this is not who this is
[1:09:01] surely he hath borne our grief
[1:09:05] and carried our sorrows
[1:09:08] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:09:11] of god and afflicted when he was hanging
[1:09:13] on the cross it didn't look like he was
[1:09:14] very much
[1:09:15] right but listen to this but he was
[1:09:18] wounded for our transgression
[1:09:22] he was bruised see there's the body the
[1:09:24] body had to come to be the sacrifice
[1:09:28] because the lamb the flesh of the lamb
[1:09:31] had to be thrown up on the
[1:09:33] on the altar amen it had to be killed
[1:09:38] and then but remember it had a life in
[1:09:40] it but that life couldn't come back
[1:09:42] on the believer and even the killing of
[1:09:46] that
[1:09:46] animal couldn't heal you
[1:09:51] no but watch this but he was wounded for
[1:09:55] our transgression
[1:09:56] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:09:58] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:10:02] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:10:07] that body looked like hamburger meat he
[1:10:08] took on everything you and i took home
[1:10:11] all we like sheep have gone astray in
[1:10:13] other words they scattered at calvary
[1:10:15] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:10:17] and the lord hath laid on him
[1:10:19] the iniquity of us all right he was
[1:10:22] oppressed
[1:10:24] and he was afflicted boy it sounded like
[1:10:25] he's having a good time on earth
[1:10:27] yet he opened not his mouth he was
[1:10:30] brought as a as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:10:32] and as a sheep before her shearers is
[1:10:34] dumb
[1:10:35] so he opened not his mouth remember when
[1:10:37] he took him into pilots hall
[1:10:39] they were trying to get him to to to say
[1:10:41] something to disprove all this
[1:10:43] rumor but he knew what he had to do
[1:10:47] he was taken from prison and from
[1:10:49] judgment
[1:10:51] and who shall declare his generation
[1:10:55] he died without having kids see i have
[1:10:58] kids i have a generation you have kids
[1:11:00] you have a generation you're part of a
[1:11:01] generation
[1:11:03] backwards going back the other way
[1:11:04] you're part of a generation he was not
[1:11:10] but he came for a purpose
[1:11:13] who shall declare his generation so the
[1:11:16] bible's declaring he has a generation
[1:11:19] but who's going to declare his
[1:11:20] generation because i'll promise you
[1:11:22] folks listen
[1:11:23] when when they took jesus and and and
[1:11:26] took him and put him on the cross
[1:11:28] except for the 11 everybody else just
[1:11:32] went back to doing what they'd been
[1:11:33] doing
[1:11:33] he was just a part of you know like they
[1:11:36] they the
[1:11:37] the portrayal in one of the movies is
[1:11:39] they just took the two thieves
[1:11:40] after they died and there was a place
[1:11:42] behind cal behind
[1:11:43] golgotha it's just a ditch and they just
[1:11:45] throw them over in the ditch
[1:11:47] but they didn't throw jesus in the ditch
[1:11:48] because joseph or armathea took his body
[1:11:51] and put him in a tomb
[1:11:52] like the bible said he was supposed to
[1:11:53] do but to everybody else they just
[1:11:56] and they just forgot about him never to
[1:11:59] remember him again caiaphas and him was
[1:12:01] like man i'm glad we got rid of that guy
[1:12:02] now it'll be quiet around here
[1:12:05] all the different religious people but
[1:12:06] when they when they walked back in that
[1:12:08] temple and they looked up
[1:12:10] and they saw the holy of holies they had
[1:12:11] to turn their head
[1:12:13] and they had to walk backwards and sew
[1:12:15] that thing back up because god had rent
[1:12:17] that temple apart
[1:12:18] or the curtain apart why testifying who
[1:12:21] this man was
[1:12:22] but he was wounded for our transgression
[1:12:24] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:12:25] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:12:27] with his stripes we were healed now
[1:12:28] watch verse 8
[1:12:29] he was taken from prison and from
[1:12:31] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:12:32] generation for he was cut off
[1:12:35] out of the land of the living he was cut
[1:12:37] off in the three dimensions that we live
[1:12:38] in he was cut off
[1:12:40] there was no way he could have progeny
[1:12:42] or a generation because he did not have
[1:12:44] children
[1:12:45] they did not come forth from the loins
[1:12:47] of jesus christ everybody got them
[1:12:49] he had no children in the land of the
[1:12:52] living
[1:12:53] right for the transgression of my people
[1:12:56] was he stricken now remember the body
[1:12:58] was a sacrifice
[1:12:59] the sacrificial lamb behold the lamb of
[1:13:01] god that takes away the sin of the world
[1:13:03] the body took the stripes
[1:13:08] so did paul so did different ones
[1:13:11] here comes the whole deal
[1:13:14] right here listen and he made his grave
[1:13:18] with the wicked with the rich in his
[1:13:19] death because he had done no violence
[1:13:21] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:13:23] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[1:13:26] hath put him to grief
[1:13:28] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:13:32] offering
[1:13:33] for sin then he'll see his progeny
[1:13:38] he shall see his seed because remember
[1:13:41] he was the sore of the seed he was the
[1:13:43] son of man but it was not sown by the
[1:13:44] loins of man that's why this thing is
[1:13:46] secret
[1:13:47] nobody can understand except a true
[1:13:49] believer
[1:13:50] how this man was cut off among the land
[1:13:52] of the living
[1:13:53] he did not have any children in other
[1:13:56] words he just wasted away somewhere they
[1:13:58] think now you know they think back then
[1:13:59] they took the body and threw it out in
[1:14:00] the desert and then they took the body
[1:14:02] and
[1:14:02] they eat it that was one story
[1:14:05] or the disciples stole it and put it
[1:14:07] wherever
[1:14:09] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:14:11] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:14:14] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:14:16] pleasure of the lord shall prosper
[1:14:19] in his hand he shall see the what
[1:14:22] travail of his soul listen that man
[1:14:25] hanging on calvary
[1:14:27] did not die he gave his life
[1:14:31] up into thy hands i commend my
[1:14:35] soul my spirit so the body could die
[1:14:39] he was in complete control there's
[1:14:41] nobody could hang for three hours and
[1:14:43] took what he took
[1:14:44] because he what that soul was almighty
[1:14:47] god
[1:14:48] and that body had to hang there for me
[1:14:50] and you as a sacrifice
[1:14:52] but the soul is what cleanses me and you
[1:14:54] folks if he hadn't went to hell
[1:14:56] if he hadn't went to paradise if he had
[1:14:58] to come back on the day of pentecost
[1:15:00] then we it was for nothing he shall see
[1:15:03] the travail of his soul
[1:15:05] john 17 brother brown said now john 17
[1:15:09] was written
[1:15:10] right at the moment they were leaving
[1:15:12] the upper room going into the garden
[1:15:16] everybody understand that if you didn't
[1:15:18] know that you know it now
[1:15:20] he prayed that prayer but when he got
[1:15:22] into gethsemane
[1:15:23] he was praying for himself that this cup
[1:15:26] would pass from me and all brother brown
[1:15:28] said there's where he fought it out
[1:15:30] not at calvary he fought it out in the
[1:15:33] garden
[1:15:35] he just went to calvary to show that he
[1:15:37] was almighty god and had complete
[1:15:39] control of everything
[1:15:44] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:15:46] but he shall see the travail of his soul
[1:15:49] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[1:15:52] shall my righteous servant justify many
[1:15:55] for he shall bear their iniquities
[1:15:57] therefore will it
[1:15:58] i divide him a portion with the great
[1:16:01] and he shall divide the spoil
[1:16:05] romans 8 verse 14 through 16
[1:16:09] heirs and joint heirs with christ he
[1:16:12] went to calvary so you don't have to
[1:16:14] he died so you don't have to
[1:16:17] therefore will i divide him a portion
[1:16:19] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:16:20] spoil
[1:16:21] with the strong because he hath poured
[1:16:24] out his soul
[1:16:26] unto death he didn't die
[1:16:29] he poured out his soul unto death
[1:16:32] brother brown said played the part of
[1:16:33] death
[1:16:34] and he was numbered with the
[1:16:35] transgressors why he was there with the
[1:16:37] two thieves and he bear the scent of
[1:16:38] many
[1:16:39] and made intercession you see the lamb
[1:16:42] regular lambs and goats and bulls
[1:16:44] could not make intercession they
[1:16:47] couldn't make personal intercession
[1:16:49] but jesus christ makes personal
[1:16:51] intercession
[1:16:52] he's the one that intercedes for me and
[1:16:54] you he's the one that
[1:16:56] he's look he's the kingpin of the whole
[1:16:59] thing
[1:16:59] if he hadn't come and died and gave his
[1:17:01] soul a ransom
[1:17:03] that soul's what went to hell and paid
[1:17:05] your price not the body
[1:17:07] the body was there though for your
[1:17:08] healing musicians come
[1:17:11] the body was there for your healing
[1:17:15] he took those stripes for me and you
[1:17:17] looked like hamburger meat the prophet
[1:17:19] that god said
[1:17:20] but that soul was what was gonna save
[1:17:23] you
[1:17:24] listen we're not saved by the blood of
[1:17:26] god we're kept saved by the blood of god
[1:17:30] we're saved by the life that was in that
[1:17:32] blood let's stand to our feet
[1:17:33] that life that was in that blood is what
[1:17:36] proved
[1:17:37] because that body just laid there
[1:17:38] brother brown said the word the body
[1:17:40] laid there in a tomb dead and cold
[1:17:45] but where was his soul where was his
[1:17:48] soul
[1:17:49] his soul was working for me and you his
[1:17:52] soul was getting us out of the prison
[1:17:54] house
[1:17:55] his soul was coming back on the day of
[1:17:57] pentecost or resurrecting
[1:17:59] and then coming back on the day of
[1:18:00] pentecost he said i'm not going to send
[1:18:02] a third person he said i'm coming back
[1:18:05] and i'm going to take you out of here
[1:18:09] amen you love the lord you got to love

[1:23:35] us to be in prayer
[1:23:36] for the services when they come up i
[1:23:38] want us to be in prayer
[1:23:40] for even our normal regular services
[1:23:42] that come in you pray for the pastor you
[1:23:44] pray for the people that
[1:23:46] that that teach you the word of god your
[1:23:47] teachers and even you
[1:23:49] the little ones that sister rachel and
[1:23:51] some of them you know it's trying with
[1:23:53] with with younger people to get their
[1:23:55] attention you know but
[1:23:56] but the bible says raise them up
[1:24:00] according to the word of the lord and
[1:24:02] all they may do like me and just
[1:24:04] you know go out in the world but
[1:24:07] the bible says when they're older
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:10] they'll return
[1:24:12] why because you give them a foundation
[1:24:13] that's why i appreciate
[1:24:16] our sunday school teachers i appreciate
[1:24:17] the ones that do that because it's a
[1:24:19] foundation
[1:24:20] amen it's a foundation
[1:24:23] even the preaching of the gospel as some
[1:24:26] we have foundations and then we have
[1:24:28] uh listen we can't all be foundation
[1:24:30] builders you'd never have a house
[1:24:33] you have to call the electrician in you
[1:24:36] have to call the plumber in you have to
[1:24:37] call the roofer in you have to call all
[1:24:38] these different ones well that's the
[1:24:40] same way with the five-fold ministry
[1:24:41] you've got these different
[1:24:43] offices that brother dale's been
[1:24:44] preaching about
[1:24:46] to put the house together because listen
[1:24:48] folks god's going to have
[1:24:50] a mature bride you can sit there just
[1:24:52] like brother brown said you can
[1:24:54] sit there tonight all night long and say
[1:24:55] the sun's not coming up in the morning
[1:24:57] the sun is not coming up in the morning
[1:24:59] and it's going to just shine sobriety
[1:25:02] in the morning because god's already
[1:25:03] said that's what's going to happen
[1:25:05] so there's going to be a bride there's
[1:25:06] going to be a mature bride you got to
[1:25:08] decide whether you want to be it or not
[1:25:09] you got to decide whether you want to
[1:25:11] put forth the effort and look at calvary
[1:25:13] first and foremost above everything look
[1:25:16] what that man did for us
[1:25:18] and then as we were talking about in
[1:25:20] brother ray's funeral
[1:25:22] that's where you got to start at but
[1:25:24] then as you start there you got
[1:25:26] you're going to come to a place that
[1:25:27] malachi 4 is going to mean something to
[1:25:29] you
[1:25:30] because god sends you elijah the prophet
[1:25:32] with the spirit of jesus christ
[1:25:35] of that same one that says believe on
[1:25:36] the lord and thou shalt be saved that
[1:25:38] same jesus is going to direct you
[1:25:40] to the true word of god he can't direct
[1:25:42] you to something false
[1:25:43] man actually overrides jesus
[1:25:47] talking to him to take a trinitarian
[1:25:50] doctrine because jesus never come to
[1:25:51] nobody said you need to be baptized in
[1:25:53] the name of father zone holy ghost
[1:25:55] he never said now you need to make sure
[1:25:57] you remember those three of us up here
[1:26:00] no but see somewhere in that
[1:26:02] communication the devil has took over
[1:26:05] and that's what we're wanting to get rid
[1:26:06] of is that gap of communication
[1:26:09] that's why the five-fold ministry that's
[1:26:11] why good deacons and elders and
[1:26:12] different ones they're
[1:26:13] they're bridging that gap to where you
[1:26:15] don't have to
[1:26:16] believe all you believe all this you
[1:26:18] don't believe all the other stuff
[1:26:20] amen young kids we're praying for you
[1:26:24] amen keep that shield up amen
[1:26:27] the devil wants you the devil don't want
[1:26:30] you more than god does but you got to
[1:26:31] want god more than the devil won't you
[1:26:32] hey man because you got to make the
[1:26:34] choice you're the one making that choice
[1:26:36] you're the one in the election you vote
[1:26:38] for
[1:26:39] jesus or you vote for the devil pretty
[1:26:42] simple so god bless you love you with
[1:26:43] the love of the lord
[1:26:44] let's bow our heads and dismiss come
