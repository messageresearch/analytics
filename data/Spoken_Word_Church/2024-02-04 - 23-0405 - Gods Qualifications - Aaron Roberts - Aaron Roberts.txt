just uh get ready to look into the scripture tonight we're going to go to Matthew chapter n and then just uh before we read the scripture let's just all bow our heads tonight and just all pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for your blessings on us Lord for another time to come in your house and we just pray that you just Lord just help us get ourselves out of the way Lord that you can have the preeminence in this service tonight Lord Lord we come to see from and hear from you Lord and we're just insufficient in ourselves Lord but Lord we come to totally depend on you Lord that you just come and speak to us tonight father and Lord we just pray for each one that's not here Lord you know the different needs ones that are sick and Afflicted Lord and we

today Lord just bless the bride around the world Lord and we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Matthew uh chapter n begin at verse 10 there it is and scripture says and came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but ye go and learn what that meth and I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the the righteous but Sinners to repentance amen God bless the reading of the word you may be seated and my my title tonight is called God's qualifications and this is a this is from the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief brother BR says there's an old proverb that's more than a proverb no matter how who is there first you have to play the rules of the game or you'll never win win if a runner is running around the track and one takes a shortcut and cuts through the field and beats the other one there by half hour still he will be disqualified at the end of the race he's got to run play it according to the rules of the game or he's disqualified and he said that's the way we have to do the race of life that we're running now it has to be played according to God's qualifications or we'll lose when we get there whether we're president whether we are the governor or minister or who what church we belong to what denomination the rules of the game has to be kept we must run it fair we must play it by the rules we must preach the word we must do it willingly Paul said I believe in Hebrews the 12th chapter that saying we are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so e easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before us Paul was speaking in the Olympics and so forth that was in Greece and Rome so forth he know that you had to play that game fair if you did not you'd be disqualified and tonight as BN again Christians as Believers here at the end time we've got to play the game according to the rules we've got to run with patience the race has set before us looking to the author and finisher Jesus Christ and so I just want to look at a few things tonight and the definition of of qualification says a quality accomplishment Etc that sets a person for some function office or the like a circumstance or condition required by law or custom for getting having or exercising a right holding an office or the like the act of qualifying the state of being qualified the word qualified the definition for that is to have a legal right to have or do something because of the situation you are in or to cause someone to have such a right to achieve or to have the standard of skill knowledge or ability that is necessary for doing or being something or to cause someone to reach that standard and so I just want to look at a few things tonight and there's several scriptures that I that I want to look at tonight but I when I was thinking this is the scripture that that came to mind is when the Pharisees were there and you know when Jesus Jesus came he came to minister the scripture said he said I'm not come I've not come to be ministered to but he said I come to minister amen and you know he he because he knew what his role was what his what his calling was and when he when he began to deal with the people you know there was a there was a calling there was a longing in the people and you know he came to to reach out to the people and it was the people that heard him that had a longing had a desire that he reached out to then they came and you it says you know he came to sit and he said many publicans and sinners came to fellowship with him and you know and then here's it says the Pharisees came and they were like well why why are y'all hanging out with the loles and the and the no goods and you know all of these people but Jesus had an answer because you know he didn't go by what the Pharisees qualif ifications were see their qualifications were they had a certain standard like listen we're not going to hang around those people because they have a bad name but see when Jesus brought the word back to them because they were supposed to know the law and they were supposed to know who they were and what what the word was sent to do and he said this is what it was sent to do he said the phys he said the physician comes to those that are sick those that are whole th those that are well he said they don't need physician but he said the ones that are sick and needy he said they're the ones that come because they're the ones that I've reached out to and he said they were the ones that respond to the word they the respond to the call and he said he said but you said you go and learn what it means why because he made it known to what he was supposed to do because they they had because they had such a a high idea of what the Messiah was going to do but they didn't realize that he came to be a servant that he came to be the lowest of the low to reach the lowest of the low that he became he became what you and I were that we might become what he is so when he came then he came he stepped into this role then he said you need to learn and understand that he said then I will have mercy why because when you realize that you're not as high as you think you are because because you you're not who you think you are because you realize that you're separated from God because when he when he began to explain the scriptures to the Pharisees you know what they have a place to stand when the when the woman at the the woman that they brought that was in the act of adultery when they came and he began to write on the ground when he began to exp you know whatever it was that he began to write on the SC on the ground but whatever it was it was something that was a rebuke to them and whatever it was but but I believe what it was to her no matter what it was to them to her it was Grace there was Grace applied to her so when it when it's because when all of a sudden all of her accusers are gone and and he said where are your accusers well lord they're gone and he said well neither do I condemn you he said but go and sin no more so it was something that was given to her that was a re that was a blessing to her but you know he just didn't he just didn't whitewash everything but he told her not to do it anymore but he but he brought her into a fellowship into a place listen this is what you need to do why because you know what he didn't have her under his foot right he didn't cast her out Bo because he came to bring Sinners to repentance but you know what if you can't if you can't ever get to the place to realize that you're a sinner that you're lost that you need help you never get any help but that's what God wants us to see because the Pharisees couldn't see that why because they were so self-righteous in what they had that it was nothing to God it was actually a stink in his nostrils but he was but he wanted to reach out this is what they come to do and so it's not it's not what our qualifications are it's God's qualifications the whole Bible is based on God's qualifications not ours many times you know the problem is we need to see we need to see the way see the things the way God sees them we need to see things the way God we need to see with God's eyes not our eyes you know many times we see you know how brother brand was speaking there in in Ohio I believe it was where was there and he went to that restaurant or whatever it was and he seen the police officer and that woman in that restaurant you know they were gambling and you know all the immoral things that had they had done or whatever and you know he began he began to look at that woman and said Lord do my daughters have to be raised in a in a country that in a state that looks like that that's that's the condition the world is in that my daughters have to be raised in that and all he could do is condemn that woman and all of a sudden when when the Lord brought him back and said listen I want you to see who you are I want I want you to see your condition when he began to see the bumper blood that covered around the world when he realized he didn't have a place to stand he was he was without anything when he stood before God he was naked he didn't have anything it was only the by the grace of God the bumper blood that covered him that that covered him that made him righteous before God and then all of a sudden when he saw he saw the condition realized that he didn't have a place to stand then all of a sudden he could go and Minister that woman and begin to speak to her about her condition and then all of a sudden you he goes up there and apologize to her for for the condition and for his way of thinking about her when he began to con because when he could was condemning her he there was no way that he could reach her there was no way he could help her but when he got to the place when he got to see her the way God saw her when he got be on his own self and he began to see that then he could help her then God could use him to help and it's the same way with you and I we have to use God's way of thinking God God's qualifications not our own amen you know many scriptures in the in the Bible we can we can see through the scriptures and there was a couple of scriptures that you know I was thinking about reading but I just want to read and quote a little bit from them but the other one that that come to mind was the Rich Young Ruler you know when the Rich Young Ruler come to Jesus and you know he said good Master you know what do I need to inherit eternal life well you know the good thing is is this young young man he had a lot of things going for him but the one thing he realized what he needed he come to ask the man who had it what he needed but the problem was when Jesus began to speak to him and Jesus the scripture says that Jesus loved him and he had a lot of good things going for him am he was he was moving in the right direction but you know what many times people want want to hear the they want to know the truth but when you tell them the truth they don't want to hear it they only think they want to know the truth you know many times people you know they I I've had I've had times even brother Brandon was talking about when he was in Mexico and that reporter come to him and and ask him you know why you believe about the Catholic church and he's like I wish you wouldn't ask me that but I'll tell you what you if you want me to tell you I'll tell you what I think you know and people people come and now ask you you know what what do you think about women preachers or what do you think about this or what do you think about that it's like well do you really want to know because you know if if you want to know what the scripture says and it's not my idea but I'm going to tell you what God qualifies I'm going to tell you what the word says it ain't my idea and it ain't ain't me trying to pick a fight with you but I'm going to tell you what the Bible says and then my then the fight is not the argument is not with me is with what the Bible says but when he told him you know what you think about the Catholic church he say it's the highest form of spiritual ISM there was well if you don't want to know don't ask that's right amen so when you begin to ask these questions you know you may not want you may not want the answer sometimes people say you know they they want to come and and they want to get help from the preacher you know they want they want counseling or they want everything well sometimes when they come they don't want the answer because all they want you to do is pet them you know they want you they want you to just Pat them on the back and tell them they're okay well sometimes you can't tell them that sometimes the word that comes is going to be cutting it's going to be hard to swallow it's going to be difficult why because that's what the word does the word is corrective but it's love but people don't want that and so when the Rich Young Ruler came before Jesus and he asked him what do I need to be to to receive eternal life what do I need and he began to tell oh you know all the all the Commandments that he done well I've already done all those things and he had such a great life but when Jesus began to look at his life and tell him exactly what he had to do you know what you're hold on up is young man you got a problem with money you want to serve God but you know what your money is your god that's your hindrance but you know the good the thing is just like brother bandam said how do you how do you get over come one of those problems he said do the vice versa just get rid of it and that's what Jesus told him listen you got a problem with money here get give it all to the poor but you know what he told him listen he said this is the plan I've got a plan for you it's an investment you're going to invest invest all your worldly Goods into the poor and you come follow me because you're making investment in me and he said you'll have Treasures in Heaven that you're going to that you're investing in something that all of a sudden you're going to get greater riches than what you'll have well but you know he couldn't he couldn't understand that financial report that's right because all of a sudden he says it says the scripture says that he was very sorrowful when he heard that because he had great possessions right then Jesus said un his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven he said again I say un you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible so when he began to look at this situation man's qualifications don't work but God has a way to qualify you for this but you've got to follow the plan and so when it when it came this is the way that you do this because God knows exactly where each one of us are and he knows that what each one of us have need of but the problem is is when God begins to speak to us about it are we going to accept the plan are we going to be qualified amen because you know there's there's many different qualifications that we've got to look at but you know when God calls a man then you know not only he qualifies the man and he equips the man we'll read here in a minute but you see God makes the qualifications we don't many times in in situations in our lives the problem is is we want to do things the way we want to do them we want to look at it the way we want to look at it and the problem is is we look at it the wrong way that's right because we're not looking at the way God's looking at it there was a man in the Bible that had that same problem and his name was Saul and Saul had Saul had an issue because his problem was when God when Samuel told him what to do and how to do it he didn't follow the plan because Saul got into in his mind that he was qualified to make those decisions but it what but it wasn't his it wasn't his qualification to make those decisions because God had a man Samuel to give him the qualifications of what he was supposed to do because he was he was God's prophet and the word come to the prophet and Samuel told him what to do and he told him he said when you go to Amal he said you utterly destroy it you don't take nothing there you leave it you burn it get rid of it it's fil and it's it's not fre for you to have but you know when when he came you know he he took all the he done exactly what the people wanted to do well you know we think because I'm qualified to make this decision I'm qualified to say that we're going to take the best of everything and he tells Samuel that we're going to offer this unto the Lord well you know we don't know if that's going to really be the case or not because you know what some of those nice sheep and cattle and everything may end up in somebody's Barn that's right some some of these fine animals some of the some of this fine gold some of these fine garments may end up somebody's closet but he goes out there and he tells but he's telling samel oh praise the lord we done the work of the Lord we' followed what what was told of us we've done what was required of us and then when he began to tell you he said well what is what is this lowing that I hear why why are these people here we these are not Israelites and why why are we hearing all these these animals and and and and Saul oh we done the we've done the work of the Lord praise the Lord we've done it and he said no you have not and Samuel says in in chapter 1st Samuel 15:22 says he said and Samuel said hath God has the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he hath rejected thee from being King so when when he rejected the word of the Lord then because he was not qualified to make that distinction because he did not follow the word of the Lord then God told him said listen you're not qualified to be king anymore you're done away with am and he said he said Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord now that was that was twice that Samuel had to tell Saul that he was wrong before he actually actually believed it right he stood in the prophet's face and honestly told him that we've done it we we followed the Lord we we done but when when Samuel had to get real with him and had to stand in his face and tell him listen God has rejected you he said he said because he said I've transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice right and so continue therefore I I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel he obeyed the voice and when when Saul begins to tell Samuel begins to tell him he's like you know when you were little in your own sight when you didn't think of much of yourself God thought enough of you to make you King but you've gotten to the place now where I it's not following the the Lord he said I feared the people I was more worried about what the people thought than what God thought I'm thinking more what they're doing and then when when Samuel rebukes him then he says oh Samuel will you turn and Worship the Lord with me because because he didn't want people to realize that God had rejected him Samuel will you come and put on just just put on this little show for other people to to show everybody it's okay this going to be okay and he's like no I'm turning away from you you rejected the Lord and I'm turning away from you you've been rejected and as Samuel turned away to go away turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mle and it rent and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou so he already had somebody but because of what he had done he had been rejected and he was turned away because God had given him what he was supposed to do and he rejected it and God rejected him and you know it was it was a heartbreaking thing for Samuel to have to do that because in the next chapter we you know he said he never saw Samuel never Samuel never saw Saul again when he walked away from him he turned his back on him and never went to see him again and you know it was a heartbreaking thing to do that because the scripture tells us in in chapter 16 and it says and the Lord said unto Samuel how long wi thou mourn for S Saul saying I rejected him from reigning over Israel he said fill thine horn with all and to go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons now this is this is an interesting passage of scripture because when you know Samuel is as re you know because he's God's rejected Saul and he tells him said listen he said now I've got a king I've got somebody in mind I want him to be king and I want you to go anoint him and being the and being the prophet of God the first thing Samuel's like uh I don't want to have to go against him and he's like well God tells him listen you just go down there and tell him you're going to sacrifice because he didn't want he didn't want to get in the ey of the king but he sent him down there said listen you just go down there and when he goes down there the SCP the scripture says he go down to sacrifice and he said and call Jesse verse three says and call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee and Samuel said after which the Lord spake and came to Bethlehem and the Elders of the Town trembled at its coming and said cometh thou peaceably and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he Sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice now what's interesting about that is when you he said he he called them to the sacrifice but when you see when he goes to anoint eliab God said that's not the one that I because he was the oldest and God says I rejected him but the Lord said verse 7even said but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance nor on the height of his stature because I have refused him but the Lord seeketh not as man seeketh for the Lord lookth on the man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart and he continues to call the men the sons and he kept rejecting them now the verse before that says that they called Samuel called all the sons of Jesse to the sacrifice and they were supposed to sanctify themselves but then all of a sudden they get down to verse 11 and Samuel says unto Jesse are here all thy children yeah well if he called all the children why why wasn't David already there he should because if he said all your children all your sons well you know what David should have been there well you know what he was the he was the least in the Kingdom least in the family and he was the one that gets overlooked because he was he was the one that was out of out of the area you know he was not there he said are here all thy children he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the Sheep we just we got him doing something cuz we don't want him under our feet he gets in our way and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in and he but he and he now he was Ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he am and Samuel took the Horn of O and anoint Ed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord came unto David from that day forward in verse 14 says but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him but it was interesting that God was looking at the man on the on the in inward part of a man but you know when they called even his own family didn't think too much of him but God knew what kind of man David was that God would call him when nobody else thought too much of him God knew what kind of man he was looking for a man after his own heart and so you know we don't we don't have the we don't have the qualifications but God knows has the qualifications he knows what he's looking for and God brings a man in and he gives him the qualifications yes now this is from the message of total deliverance and and brother brand is speaking of Moses they said and Moses when he was called by God he was a he was a total complete prophet and when God sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything that he has need of if God calls a man to be a preacher he put something in him to preach with if he calls him to be a teacher he put something in him to teach with if he calls for him to be a prophet he puts something in him to see visions and be a prophet God always complet completely equips his man and that's just what he done when he sent Moses into Egypt he raised him up in a certain way and he schooled him in a certain way and he molded him and made him and fashioned him so when he called Moses all the things that Moses had to go through you know many times when people they when they have a a failure just like Moses when Moses was was pulled out of the out of the Nile by Pharaoh's daughter and was raised Ed up in Pharaoh's house and he become this great man and he had this great understanding and great learning and he was this great man but when he become to try to do what what he was called to do what his mother told him that he was supposed to do was supposed to be the deliverer of God's people when he kept when he realized when his mother told him said you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter but you're the deliverer because we've prayed your father and I prayed for a deliverer because we were we were there when the taskmasters we've seen people die because of the Egyptians but God sent a deliverer and it's you God give you the calling he called you to do this amen but when he come to the place he didn't follow God's plan he didn't do it in God's leading he didn't do it in God's time but he thought he could do it in his own self because he was so trained he was he was so smart he was so intelligent he thought he could work this thing he thought he could he could make a plan and make it happen but the problem was he all he done was caus a bunch of fighting and and turmoil amongst all the all the Israel the children of Israel it had a dead Egyptian but you know then all of a sudden when all that happen there there's people when when people have faults and failures and problems you know there's a lot of people you know they wouldn't had anything to do with Moses but you know why because you're an utter you're an utter failure you've made a big mess out of this and so we wouldn't touch you with a 10- foot pole but you know what when God brought him all through that and put him on the backs side of the desert for another 40 years to beat all of the all of the stuff of Egypt out of him all of his learning and everything when he beat all that out of him in 80 years of living God got him to the place that he wanted him to be and it wasn't and it wasn't what man thought of of Moses's qualifications it's what God thought of go of moses' qualifications because God was the one that qualified him to be that and he and he made him in the way that he wanted him to be so he brought him to that place and when he went down there that he was in the place that he could be the deliverer why because it never changed what his calling was it just got him to the place that he could do it why because he got to the place where he could listen and follow the instructions of the Lord because God had to have because he had to have a one-on-one experience with God to come to the place that he could do that right that's right and when he got to the place where he where he could come to and have an experience then God could use him many times that's what our problem is is we we don't lean to that you know we lean to our own [Music] understanding brother Brown continues on here he says then just like you if you're a Christian God Don't Make Any halfway Christians God makes complete Christians he said God Don't Make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but some times they're halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that way right it's their own ways got mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on each side he want or he wants them to be completely stand in the breach them to completely stand in the breach and he said see Moses God made him a complete Prophet for a complete deliverance and Moses was completely surrendered into the hands of God that's the reason it made him what he was he was so complete in God till God could trust him he come to the place why because he went through those things because of what he had been through in his life it brought him to the place that God could trust him but he could yield himself to God brother B says continuing on he said I wonder this morning as Christians if we have yielded our own will and yielded ourselves completely to God till God can trust us the place that he has put us why because we want to be used of God well if God has put us in there but have we yielded ourselves to that why because you know we we can be halfway Christians but we can still Christians but are we just halfway are we just three quarters because you know like the old song is you know we're looking for a 100 cuz 99 and a half won't do because if there's any part of us that has not yielded ourselves to God then you know what God is not looking for that right because you know what you can be 99% yielded to God and be 100% failure right because God wants us to be totally absolutely yielded to him we don't have we don't have a thought coming we don't have an idea coming it's what God says let us yield ourselves to him and see have we to God trust us in the place he's put us he said The Minister's got a place of Duty to to stand and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromising if he's called to be a preacher he won't he would spare one thing for one person if he's called to be a preacher amen why because you know it's it's not all fun in games why because everybody you know people like well you know preachers want to want to you know turn a blind eye to this or or their family or whatever no you've got you've got to have it's got to be even it's got to be because what's good for one is good for all that's right can't you can't just turn a blind eye to this one and that one it's always got to be and you know what it's not it's not always fun but you know what it's it's the word of God but you know that's the that's the one thing that most people are always going to see you know it's always going to be well brother white said this to me but you know such and such got by with it or they but you know what you never see the other side of the coin you never see the other side of the situation because you know brother D may handle one situation a certain way and and another another thing comes up and he handles it a different way and people well why why is that why was it this way and why was it that way why because God knows what he's doing am many times we don't know we don't know what God has told somebody amen why is it because you know just like in the scripture when people well why is this this way why is that way I said well why is it that when God says not to make any Graven image but but then he turn around to tell Moses to raise up a Brazen serpent for healing why because you got to know God is Sovereign and God's going to handle it a certain way amen because many times people get upset with things and it's like well I don't like this and I don't like that the problem is is we've not sat down and prayed and find out what God says about it and instead of opening our mouth and saying things before we actually pray about it and think what we're going to say you know when God Called Moses to be the deliverer when God called him to do a work then you know what there was no place no matter what went what on what went on you know what Miriam and Aaron had no place to stand up and criticize Moses no M no matter it was their their brother that they that they were saying that about it was still God's prophet and still God had had stand and rejected that and had and had to rebuke that and they had to be judged for it and sometimes you know why because we're so quick to say things and not realize what we're saying why because there's power in your words by your words you'll be justified by your words you'll be condemned but you've got to be careful by what you say right amen and so many times you know I I just want I just want to hold my peace or hold my tongue I may think things but you know what think is Lord let me pray about it before I say anything because many times we don't know what's going on and so when it's not when it's not our place and we've got to be careful what we say that's the reason it's so important that we pray right and you pray for the leadership of this church yes amen I was I to tell you something it's not I don't I don't know about y'all but I I'm going to tell you this much I don't believe there's anybody in this church that's up here that's got a position that's doing this because you know they they want to have somebody looking at them and it's they're doing it on their own I believe I believe the I believe the ministry in this church is Led of God yes sir and whether we like it or not whether we agree with them or not whether they hurt our feelings or not I still believe it's a godall Ministry and so and sometimes you know we let things get out of hand so that's the reason it's so important to be careful about what we say because you know what it's not it's not our qualifications for these things it's God's qualifications because God lays down the law and God gives gives the word and so what whatever takes place we've got to be careful about it it can be dangerous amen but that's what the devil wants us to do because the devil's always got to find some way he's got to he's got to have his punch at you he's either going to get to you or he's going to get to the ministry he's going to get to your family somehow he's got something that he's always going to stir the turmoil up there's always got there's always got to be some way he's going to get to you you know you know it was it was said one time and talking about talking about being a minister you know it's like you know they talk about us being moody and you know we we get bad attitudes and and and different things and it's like well I don't I don't know if we do or not I mean I just know that you know if you ever try to study or or pray or something like that you know don't worry about it that you know they won't say nothing to you all day long but as soon as you start to pray study then you know everything goes wrong and everybody wants to talk to you and you know it's it's always there's always something that goes on why because that's God you know because that's when God wants to speak to you the devil's going to hinder it and what was it the message recognizing your day and its message and brother Brandon was talking about trying to he said he felt like the Lord was trying to talk to him and he said everything he done he said the food that he ate didn't settle with him and he said you know every time he said I was in the basement he said I was trying to pray I was trying to read he said I end up falling asleep he said it was just like I I was the Lord was trying to talk to me he said everywhere I'd go he said I was trying to get there I was trying to hear from the Lord and he said it was just like the devil kept trying to hinder him the whole time but he said it felt like the Lord was trying to get to him and he said the more he just but he had to keep pressing he had to keep pressing forward to get to to get to the place that the Lord could speak to him you know as the old saying is you know there's a blessing in the pressing so you got to keep pressing and so you know maybe maybe we are that you know maybe preachers are that way I don't know but you know I mean but that's that's the thing you you've got to overcome that because you know that's just everyday life that's just that's and you know everybody's made different as brother random said said you know we we get these things it's just the human grab bag you know we just have these things that come everybody's different everybody's personalities different there's different things that that you have to deal with but all these things that would come our way but you know we just keep pressing and you know whatever it is God's trying to reach us but the devil's always going to try to hinder that but we just keep pressing that battle yeah see now this is from the the Mighty God unveiled and he brother talking about he said in the Old Testament Genesis 1 in the beginning God about the self-existing one the Elohim said the difference in the word and it continues on about being self-existent so we can't be that he said so God in the beginning was life the Eternal one he said in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back he had to be somewhere to be brought back to so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts and then so he continues on he said look at the priest he said when they see him Express himself exactly with the word what he was they said it's be elub they showed where they their nature was he said it was in the modern thought of the day but when the little prostitute when he met at that gate and told her expressed his Messiah Son by telling her what she had done he said why she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet we know the Messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things she was recognizing him as the Messiah the anointed one because he met the scripture qualifications don't you see the congregation says man the two pieces of paper that were coming together she said we know that when the Messiah cometh so when he when she began to see these things as he was talking about they tie together they see because the the when Jesus came and he began to minister the the Pharisees didn't agree with him they didn't see these things but you know what it wasn't for them to see it because when he was when he was Elohim when he was self-existing he had those attributes inside of it and it didn't matter where they came or where they were at that attribute of God is always going to be displayed it was coming to the place that God called it to and so here's this woman that you know nobody nobody thought anything of her you know who who would have thought that she was the seed of God who would have thought that she was the one but here she's the one that come and when when they saw the same when she saw the same thing that the Pharisees saw then they called it the elub and they said that you're just you're just Anointed with a devil but when she saw it she saw that the scriptures had come alive when it began she saw the scriptures being manifested in front of her and said sir I proceed you to be a prophet because that's what the scripture says that would be done and you know what not only did she not see that she was he she saw a prophet but in the greater Revelation that came to her through Jesus was that when she said when the Messiah comes he'll do these things and he identified himself in the scripture to her amen a lot of people well Jesus was just a prophet but they didn't see that he was the Messiah but she saw who he was why because when she re received the word and she saw that God was working there that that had to be the hand of God that was working and when she saw that then said we know that when the Messiah comes he's going to do these things we're looking for the Messiah right when we see God on the scene and working we know that's when the Messiah is coming one day we don't know when he's coming but we're looking for him and one of a great thing was when she was looking for the Messiah she stood in front of the Messiah and he identified himself to her she began to see who he was brother says and you see now God might have had to inate this to that he said to get this certain tting of the baale like the molder when when Jesus turned he said I am he that speaks unto you there was no such an expression as beel she left her water part and ran into the City and said come see a man who told me the things that I have done isn't this the very Messiah see he said now what what what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was giving her what did it do it made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought her back when she he seen the express scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was and what he is so when it became to the place that she began to see why because she was looking for something and when it was manifest in front of her she received it but because it was for her it was for her day and it was for her time it was her time to receive it it's the same way with you and I brothers and sisters Now's the Time to receive the word the word is made manifest now see many times people we they they miss what was what's been going on the movement of of the Lord seeing the things that was taking place you know they they miss these things because they they just gloss over it or they don't catch it because they don't see what's taking place but you know here in and once more Lord Brother R is speaking and he's talking about 1933 see Catching the things that's taking place and seeing what's what's been going on and when he stands there and he talks about the morning that the the Holy Spirit Come and told him the seven things that was going to take place you know what the visions that he had was talking about what was going to take place now you know whether whether you believe this or not I believe it I believe it's thus sayith the Lord now everybody else can spend the rest of their life trying to tear it down and say well it didn't really happen and and this or that well you know what y'all can you know they can do that or or whoever you know whatever that's fine but you know to me it's life to me it's truth I believe these things took place amen when he began to talk about that even brother ra said you know he said he had those papers and he wrote them and he said people's come to the church and actually read what what he wrote what he prophesied in the church and you know people that were actually there that actually heard him say these things whether whether they believe that or not you know that's up to them but I'm just I'm just one that believes it's the truth I I just that's just me you know but but when he talks about all these things taking place and he said you know they would elect the wrong president and uh right before the right before you get to the highlighted portion there he said they and they said and this this would be a woman stand up and would govern the United States not actually a woman but a church then we see her with nothing but ashes it's going to happen right you know you see the the condition that the world is in and whether whether you believe it or not this is this is this is for this is prophesied of what's going to take place he said five of those things has perfectly been fulfilled exactly how melini would rise and go to Ethiopia and fall at his steps and he would be turned to the people in shame with a woman many many years before it actually before it happened perfectly on the dot it's never failed and it won't fail because it's thus sayith the Lord and it's not contrary to these Bible it's got to be so the things that people you know when when people talk about is it actually in the scripture are we actually looking at things that are in the scripture well you know you know there's a lot of things that you have to realize that when a prophet speaks it speaks according to the scripture why because if he's Vindicated according to the scripture than what he says is truth and that he's speaking the truth but what's so amazing is is the one thing that brother Ram said the even the Bible tells us about the way that you can tell a prophet is right was when he says these things if it comes to pass amen so we know these things but you know the thing is is what happened what's your experience what what God has spoke to you that's whether you tell if it's true or not he continues on here and he's speaking of the organizations and everything and he says and she is making love to her daughters woing them right back again he said with no spiritual understanding stripped it's an oasis for her why because if you don't see the condition that the world is in oh it looks so wonderful see the condition that they say oh it's a what a grand thing it is oh my and Pentecostal men sitting in the council at Rome and sending letters around and said is it it was the most spiritual time they've ever seen how could a born again man cut off his secret cut off the word and they live by a Creed that's exactly what dalila has done today cutting off the word and you live by the creek when when brother brandham was standing there and telling them listen you can't follow into that old denomination because you were called out of it because he said come out of her my people touch not the unclean thing and when he began to identify the spirit of the age and what was going to take place and you can't mess with the denominations because there's a spirit on that and it's the spirit of antichrist and he's calling them back and he's calling the people back to the word and brother random standing there telling them what the scripture is and identifying the day and age in which we live and he kept telling them and yet they go right back to that why because they get under a spirit and an anointing where you can be anointed and have false word you can you can believe a lie and be anointed of the Holy Spirit right oh what a wonderful thing but not realized yet and he said but they realized they were being cut off the word was being cut off from them just like Samson when he went in there and he laid in the lap of dalila and had his had his Covenant cut off they the Pentecostals had the exact same thing because they thought they were qualified they thought they had the spiritual understanding when they stood there in the days of a prophet and he began to explain to them where they were at and understand they were devoid of those scripture they devoid of of the word just because you're anointed because the Holy Spirit falls on you whatever you say whatever happens is right and that's how that's how the devil could deceive the people brother BR said the scripture says that that they would believe a lie and be damned by it right amen why because they're following the anointing and not following the word it's not just by having an anointing it's what the word says He said now look he said look at the defeat today he said from what it would be ministers instead of god- called Ministers of our pent Pentecostal group he said they had you have to have a a doctor degree before you get in the pull pit he said you got to have a fellowship card he said now in our great denomination of Pentecost before you can send a send a missionary they got to send him before a psychiatrist see if he can stand the mental test he said he said see now that's right he said I wouldn't say that unless I could back it up see tell me if that's the qualification of a minister see God God didn't need some man to come up with some idea what would take place well we we've got to we've got to we got to have something to do with this no God started the church the way he wanted it and he kept the same way and if he qualified one man to lead and preach then guess what he kept them all the same then you know what then then they didn't have to have some kind of qualifications he said the Bible they never went before any psychiatrist but they waited in the city of Jerusalem until they were filled with power from on high am hey some of them could not even write their name a few days later one passed through the gate called beautiful and he had never seen never been before a psychiatrist he never had his Fellowship card and he said such as I have I have never seen a fellowship card produce that why because they they got to have their own ideas of how things ought to operate and not realizing it's totally opposite of what the word says He said what are we he said we are stripped embarrassed in the presence of the Holy Ghost it's certainly for fulfills what the prophet said in second Timothy 3 itd behe highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God why because they're totally stripped embarrassed in front of the Holy Ghost why because when the truth began to be known you know what when brother Brandon was stood up and he began to speak to the to the Pentecostals and he began to tell them listen he said I'm not he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and he began to talk about the same the same uh Ministry that Paul had and he began to talk about the things that me that Paul went through and Paul was rejected by men and he rejected the the leaders of his day rejected solidly rejected his ministry and what he preached and he said listen it's the same way today the word has been made made restored in our day and he said it was totally rejected by man it was totally rejected by by the denominations and it's and let me tell you something it's not just out there looking all these different places but let me tell you it's the same Spirit of the enemy today and he just changes he might change his dwelling place but let me tell you it's the same spirit and it's still as the as the word Goes Forth as the word as the bride goes continues on then guess what the spirit of the enemy the spirit that's going to continue to battle her is not going to be out there in the denominations it's going to be right around this message it's going to be right there standing because there's still going to be a mixed multitude that's going to stand in the way this is from God change does God change his mind he said but I want you to say this in closing he said God never changed his mind the the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now that don't mean in a certain way that means he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I shall he do also is that right he promised in Mark 16 these shines shall follow them that believe he said now well that was just for the Apostle he said go ye in all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them all in all the world to every creature in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or de drink deadly things it won't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover he said now that's his qualification see we try to qualify something we are trying to make qualify the church to what we think God's word is we can't qualify to the church we've got to qualify to God we got to qualify to What God Says see God is God is the one that lays down the qualifications but you the thing is is if we actually have if we believe what God has said what the qualifications are then you know what we still have the power to do the same thing am that it's that we still have the power that we still have the authority that it's still in in a force tonight and it's no matter where you think you are or who you are if you're a believer in the word even even the most lowest simplest person the least in the Kingdom still has the authority to and the still right to do that then you have the right to claim your god-given inheritance God has called us to that see this is from the smart of church age brother BR says tongues he said tongues is he said it's time to get back to God he said they have a name that they live but they are dead he said tongues is the evidence of a Revival right he said it's the evidence of death he said tongues proclaim the evidence that the cereem IAL religion of the Jews was over that a new era had begun tongues today is ringing down the curtain on the Gentile Church ages and the gospel is going back to the Jews people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat the truth is that it is the writing the Finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of God is being ushered in wake up people of God wake up continuing on here he says he said 'if you don't think this is true just listen to this he said all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pull pit without a call from God they have styled themselves the Fishers of Men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 10-13 that God gave the churches failed and they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of prophet called The Gang sayans of Kora and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may God have pity on them may their eyes be open before it's too late so when you begin to see here he's talking about this great movement of God the Pentecostals well this is the great move of God here's the tongues that's going to take place and now realizing according to scripture when brother Ram said this is Judgment falling because now is the ending of the Gentile dispensation and it's now going back to the Jews and not realizing now is the end of the time when this was to take place and he began why because there had to be a prophet in the sing to express this to tell the people what was going to take place and oh this is a great move of God no the scripture tells us that when when uh in there in the scripture Nebuchadnezzar and when when they saw that they said you've been found way in the balance and found walting when the when the scripture came down and it began and they had and Daniel had to uh trans translate that interpret what was saying and realize that that they were under judgment and brother said that was the end of the Gentiles and so when now we've reached the end of the Gentiles and now it's going back to the Jews the end of the Jews so now the word is going back to the Jews it's the end of the Gentiles and he begins to talk about what's to take place and people not realizing what's taking place and when he when he stands here and he says see people are looking at these things and and not realing but that's what was to take place there was a there was a falling away from the scriptures because he said the that in the end time that he would fulfill the word but there would be a falling away that they're turning away from the scripture why because they they think they've got the truth and they don't and here they are he says they have turned away from the from the for real true five-fold Ministry brother said there there was a gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 and and what that's what struck me the other day when I was reading that he said that that God gave the church they've got to the place where they think the fivefold ministry God gave these he gave those gifts into the into the body and these people have think they've qualifi they're qualified to stand up and say this gifted Ministry of Ephesians for has failed and they've got they've got their own people that are raising up he was talking about the the the Full Gospel businessman and brother BR standing there and tell him listen you are not called to be in the in the ministry you're not called to be in the pull pit but see then it's the same Spirit that's here today it's the exact same Spirit why because if if they stood back there and said the fivefold ministry is not is not any good it has fallen it has failed then guess what it's the same Spirit that's here today right we don't have to have a five-fold min anymore today why because it has failed and so all of a sudden it's the same spirit and it says they're raising up to take over which is exactly the same thing that we see today we don't need a five-fold Ministry why because we have the prophet we're just going to push play we're just going to hear what the prophet had to say well you know what that doesn't that does totally away with the with the word of God why because God was the one that called and started the the five-fold ministry and you don't you're not I don't care who you are you're not qualified to take them out amen that's right brother see God put the gifts in the body and you know what we're not qualified to take them out but God is the one that controls all that see we see the same thing as it was with the gang saying of Kora oh we're we're we're just we're just as anointed as y'all are we've got the understanding God speaks to us too I wouldn't trust it no further than I could throw it but see that's the whole problem people got to the place where they don't even realize that it takes God to qualify somebody somebody that's anointed of God God does the calling God does the anointing God does the equipping so you brother B says here in in the patus vision he says he said you can't do any good until first you get in the spirit am he said God can't use you he said he said all all your efforts are in vain until you first get in the spirit he said if I sing I will sing in the spirit if I pray said Paul I I pray in the spirit then if there is anything that comes to me that's any good it's got to be revealed to me by the spirit and confirmed by the word made manifest by the results it Bears amen see it's got to come by the word not just not just some kind of uh thought or idea but it's got to line up with the entire word it's got a Dov tail with everything he said like in other words if I say Jesus Christ promised in his word he said that if I would repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said I will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the first thing for me to do is to repent he said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if I I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost first thing for me to do is repent is revealed to me that that's true then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then the results is I'll receive the Holy Ghost and he continu if if I if I'm sick and I and he promised that if I would believe and have the Elders of the church anoint me with all pray over me and the prayer of faith shall save the sick he said Lord I believe he said I follow your instructions then he continues on see we've got he said when God says anything it has to take place so when you meet God's qualifications just remember God will himself manifest himself and take care of it you just go ahead it's a finished work oh isn't that wonderful oh oh my just think God said you do this and I'll do this well if I go do this he's got to do that so then you've got to take him at his word and follow follow what he said but he spoke it then you've got to have it and believe it and it's got to be Quicken to you by the scripture so if you believe that then if youve received the Holy Ghost if you received a New Birth by following what the scripture says if you follow through that when you receive that then it will the scripture says that he will lead you and guide you into all truth then when he begins to lead you and begins to express these things to you the scripture says that in acts: 18 he said he said but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and in the uttermost part of the earth and then and this is from the message Witnesses he said now to be a witness he said a witness must be first qualified in the courts of our land and Supreme Court he talk about being a you got to be examined before you can be a witness he said you got to stand an examination he said if you've got to do that he said how how much more will the god of Heaven require an examination and a qualified witness before we are recognized in his sight as a correct witness so he gave his commission to disciples or the 120 that they should wait at Jerusalem until they are qualified to be Witnesses right see there was a certain specification that we must meet before we are qualified as a witness and this witness was to be this qualification was to be the coming of the promised Holy Spirit to fill the church with unction and the word unction comes from the Greek word Dynamite which means an explosion there must be something they must receive something before they can be a witness he said God never sends a man until first he has made him a qualified witness so we have to he said Lord somebody said somebody said they throw your case out you've got to be a right witness you've got to have you've got to have seen something or or heard something you got to know something they're not going to have any hearsay you've got to know what you're talking about he said any any attorney knows that you cannot be a witness unless you have seen it for yourself not what somebody else said you have seen it and hear it either hear or see or hear before you can be a witness so you've got to know and so when he calls you to be a witness it's it's for a real experience to you right when you've received that that Holy Spirit when you when you've been brought in and you you've been birthed into the body then you become a witness to know these things to be a witness why because when you stand up then your life becomes a witness to people then then it's not just not just some idea but it's the truth what the scripture says becomes a manifestation in your life he said because when these things come then he said it be a manifestation and the results will be the manifestation of the word so that's what our that's what our job is that's what our goal is amen for us to manifest these things to know what God Said and what God wants done with the word for us to understand who we are and what God has called us to to realize God has qualified you to these things because you know what if if he's if he's pleased with you then then he gave you the Holy Ghost if he come up if he came to live inside of you if he come to take up residence in you to live through you you to manifest himself to the world through you for you to be an overcomer it's not because Paul said it's no longer I that live now but he said Christ that lives in me so you know what it's not me overcoming but it's him through me overcoming I can't overcome these things but it's him through me can overcome then I can realize that through him I'm an overcomer I'm more than a conqueror through him that loved me that I have to realize I just Rel on him l i just yield myself to him Lord I want you to be the Lord not just my savior I want you to be the Lord I want you to be the ruler of all things this Lord that's what I need this is from the from the message the statue of a perfect man and he says he said I want you to take it and study it and compare it and then act upon it see that's what God wants us to do to realize who we are what God is because these are requirements right not not just not just to be born again say well I'm just I'm just in the family of God well that's good but you know what there's more than that that's required God God has something he wants you to do he wants there's a place for you it's like well I don't know what my place is well that's Now's the Time to be think you know praying about it and seeing what God wants you to do and realize God has equipped you to be a member a productive member of the body of Christ amen you know because everybody in the family's got got a job and we all no matter how small or insignificant God gives us a job God places Us in the body then you know we've got to do that portion because you know what without each individual person without each individual member of the body you know we're incomplete amen right we all have whether we think how we look at ourselves and realize well we look at ourselves as insignificant but you know what in the mind of God that's not the way God sees it right God sees you as a valuable portion of the body a valuable part of the body God wants you to realize who you are well you because you know I want to look at see well I'm not this I'm not no God wants you to recognize who you are and our goal our our job should be our desire should be you know just be faithful to what God has called us to he said I want you to he said I want you to take it and study it compare it and then act upon it he said don't just study it compare it but act upon it when you do take it seriously to yourself don't say well I enjoyed listening at it I it too but to listen at it and then receiving is different amen see see it's different see he said there is seven qualifications to make the stature of God it continues on the seven Church ages and talks about the number of completion and drops down brother B says he said let's add to our faith these things then we might come to the full stature of Christ being joined together with Godly love fear of God reverence in our heart to one another deep respect to one another brotherly and sisterly kindness never vulgarity nothing but just the purity of Holy Ghost living see live together be Christian walk with faith let the virtue of God flow through you let the knowledge of God when it comes to right and wrong when the devil presents something that's not exactly scriptural walk away from it that's right he said I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us they went around probably men a few words till they got in the ppit they walked in and done what they were supposed to do and walked and walked out yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no arguments with men they know where they stood that's all they know who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit doing only am he said just like he said the other night one little nod that's all had to do all God had to do then nothing going to stop them they didn't question and study and in hum Hall and and worry like we do whether we should do this or that they went ahead and done it anyhow amen just one little nod that done it just as soon why they they could how could they know it it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications and this first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they know it was the word of God and away they went didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went he said and then this is from Blasphemous names then when we have met these qualifications and become full of the virtues of God and the things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom don't know don't worry everybody will know you got it you won't have to say well glory to God I know I got it I spoke with tongues glory to God I know I got it I danced in the spirit once you won't have to say a word about it everybody will know you got it don't you worry yeah it'll testify for for itself he will let it be known among men amen so that's that's my desire Lord I want to be to the place that God God can work through me and that people can see God in Me amen let's all stand this evening have the musicians come I want to sing that little song I Want To Live the way he wants me to live yes sir cuz that's what that's what I want I want these virtues they're required but you know what he's made a way for you to have these virtues and if he's made way then he said then you don't have to worry about it if God's on the inside will be made manifest that's what I that's what my desire amen amen praise the Lord I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to live until just no more to give I want to love [Music] love I could never ever I love the Lord I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to Lord time and sight Lord it means nothing to you Lord Lord this one that's battling this cancer Lord All This Time
