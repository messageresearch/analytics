[22:34] each day we move forward in time is one
[22:38] day short of eternity so we just move up
[22:42] one more day one more day is because
[22:44] that much closer home so just remember
[22:47] that also remember now the bible study

[23:35] destruction so we believe in we thank
[23:37] you just have your way down and keep us
[23:39] in Jesus name Amen and we've been
[23:44] reading from revelations one the
[23:49] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[23:50] gave unto him to show into his servants
[23:54] things which must shortly come to pass
[23:55] and he sent and signified it by his
[23:58] angel unto his servant John who by
[24:02] record of the word of God and of the
[24:04] testimony of Jesus Christ and all the
[24:07] things that he saw unless it is he that
[24:09] readeth and they that you're the words
[24:10] of this prophecy and keep those things
[24:13] which are written therein for the time
[24:16] is at hand I believe it's time to
[24:19] understand what you I believe it's time
[24:22] to understand okay you're only 29 very
[24:25] familiar with all of us verse 29 the
[24:30] secret things belong to the Lord our God
[24:32] but those things which are revealed
[24:35] belong to us into our children forever
[24:38] that we may do all the words of this
[24:41] love you may be seated devoted his
[24:44] blessing to the reading of the word now
[24:47] remember that we will be getting back to
[24:51] it more to cover but I believe we're
[24:55] just getting enough of the word of God
[24:57] revealed to us here to be able to
[25:01] comprehend when we get there No so
[25:06] that's why I like that scripture see the
[25:08] secret things belong under Lord our God
[25:11] there are things that he will not reveal
[25:15] to us while we're here upon this earth
[25:18] but we'll have an eternity of a
[25:21] never-ending revelation from
[25:23] God's Word to be able to rejoice in and
[25:26] see those things so you know is I'm
[25:29] looking forward to it but I'm still want
[25:31] to make sure one thing that we get the
[25:33] foundation right here and then getting
[25:37] it right here then we can him you know
[25:39] be ready for that day but now what we've
[25:42] been talking about in the book of
[25:45] revelations that this book is the only
[25:49] book in the Bible where as Jesus
[25:52] personally appearing to ascribe dirac
[25:54] that's pates 13 church age book and he
[25:59] he came to him in a way that there's not
[26:03] been trying to get you to see because
[26:05] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that
[26:08] God gave unto him all right there were
[26:11] some things he didn't know he didn't
[26:13] know his part in the kingdom the Prophet
[26:15] said but actually come to the Isle of
[26:17] Patmos then um he did know because he
[26:20] had come from God and went back to God
[26:22] so he was there and had great
[26:24] understanding the brain of John on
[26:27] Patmos and he said was signified it by
[26:30] his angel to John to where the John
[26:34] could hide it down and bring it up to us
[26:36] we'll always well and good but my point
[26:40] has been one thing you remember it that
[26:43] no matter if an angel comes to you it
[26:48] speaks to you or whatever even no matter
[26:51] what it would be if God doesn't come on
[26:56] the scene to show that that's correct
[26:58] what good is all of that see and Paul
[27:02] said even if an angel come from heaven
[27:04] and bring something contrary to what
[27:06] he's saying it now that's pretty strong
[27:08] in but i still believe its work don't
[27:11] you a bit i'm actually then brother
[27:13] branham couldn't come in and bring us
[27:15] anything different from what Paul hair
[27:19] he would be under that curse but see
[27:23] we're trying to get to the point to see
[27:24] what is taking place and there in the
[27:29] first chapter we see that the fact that
[27:32] I did he's revealing to join my way of
[27:37] the angel but Jesus Christ steps on the
[27:40] scene now that's the point that I've
[27:41] been trying to make into three services
[27:43] and I want to make sure you get that
[27:45] will try to cut a little short tonight
[27:47] and Boyd cut a little short on the scene
[27:50] will cut a little short cut of the bad
[27:51] weather and to make sure no problem is
[27:54] going home but now we put the emphasis
[28:02] and we all believe in God sends angels
[28:05] when Smith services expressing what they
[28:08] were but they were ministering spirits
[28:11] and forth the ministers to the heirs of
[28:13] righteousness and then it went from
[28:15] ministering spirits as far as as those
[28:18] things we went through showing that it
[28:20] was angels were ministers messengers on
[28:25] earth you know and coming down here to
[28:28] work that it wouldn't ministering and
[28:30] they watch after your soul all right
[28:33] you'll see then it we found out that
[28:35] it's all the operation of the Holy
[28:38] Spirit but it's not to just say well
[28:41] that's just the Holy Spirit see your
[28:43] lumping it into a way that you're not
[28:46] allowing God to be able to reveal
[28:51] himself the way he wants to I believe he
[28:54] wants to make known to each and every
[28:57] one of us his ways his actions his
[29:00] character his desires his whole being is
[29:04] what he's trying to reveal to you now
[29:05] well if we cut short on anything see
[29:09] then we're losing part of that I made a
[29:12] statement at the end of the life service
[29:13] and i speaking i said there is even
[29:16] attributes of god that he has not
[29:18] displayed well I'm sure that's race from
[29:21] eyebrows by some but I still believe it
[29:24] because if there's a message of cheer
[29:25] down to the endless ages to come then
[29:29] there is more of God to reveal and then
[29:31] you reach neuter only 29 29 the secret
[29:34] thing
[29:35] belonging to god though there are some
[29:39] things that you won't tell us why we're
[29:41] here but we're going to get enough here
[29:43] to go that honor that's what we're here
[29:45] for is to get that done and now what I
[29:49] want to do tonight this is the thought
[29:50] of my night now I want you and I to stop
[29:55] one thing that we're doing I say may you
[29:58] all of us we're limiting God because of
[30:07] the fact of the way we think and the way
[30:14] we do now this is what's been on my
[30:16] heart so you know the way we do is we we
[30:22] say go I can do all things but then we
[30:26] turn around and say well but many he
[30:29] don't want to do it night we see you're
[30:32] putting a limit on God and what he can
[30:34] do because he's waiting on you and I now
[30:38] will get down to it a little bit in the
[30:39] message of me you know that see jesus
[30:43] said I am the vine you are the branches
[30:49] now a fine doesn't bear fruit it's the
[30:55] branch that runs off of that right you
[30:57] take even your grapevine that you look
[30:59] at you know and it runs out and all now
[31:02] it may have little stuff grows out here
[31:04] and younger cuz that that but get the
[31:06] line point is what is you cut it back in
[31:09] your pruning actually right back to the
[31:11] vine and it put out a new brain when it
[31:14] puts out a new branch darts where your
[31:16] fruits going to it so I believe God's
[31:19] waiting on you and I baby you know
[31:22] that's my whole thing
[31:24] thinking about for probably a week or so
[31:26] now that that we limit God in the basis
[31:30] that were not releasing the faith that
[31:33] we actually have I believe we have faith
[31:36] prophet said you have faith he said you
[31:39] just don't know what to do with it you
[31:41] don't know how to turn it loose alright
[31:43] and see by having any doubt in our mind
[31:46] of anything that God has promised I'm
[31:51] not worried about what he ain't promised
[31:53] you know that's what am I tried to
[31:55] figure out they want to write some great
[31:57] something that they can't find the Bible
[31:59] to back up what they're doing and
[32:01] entitle bring it like a man told me one
[32:04] time did he wouldn't he wasn't working
[32:06] on commanding the devil anymore he was
[32:09] working on commanding the Lord because
[32:12] the Bible said command Z me I said
[32:15] that's not exactly what that's being
[32:18] safe well that's what it said you know
[32:21] he would tighten of the answer we don't
[32:23] need food with it but you see we're
[32:25] trying to make something else out of it
[32:27] instead of just simply taking what God
[32:30] says don't you simply believe in who we
[32:35] are right and that's what I've tried to
[32:37] do with with a whole part we're home and
[32:40] you know for years and I've said this to
[32:42] you that the book of Revelation doesn't
[32:45] show Jesus Christ by himself it doesn't
[32:50] you know it shows him in bright form
[32:53] aren't sure the two witnesses or it'll
[32:55] show the things like that it doesn't
[32:58] show him by himself because he chose it
[33:02] to be that way he wants you and I to
[33:04] realize we were part of this the prophet
[33:07] of God said to God hath not complete
[33:09] without you when I don't seem to their
[33:13] way now I could agree with that about
[33:16] run around
[33:17] now but but I just don't know was
[33:19] sitting in your stopping God he can't
[33:22] manifest what he wants to write a min me
[33:25] I believe that the word has been brought
[33:28] in to us me to wear that we can stand
[33:33] upon I know what a lot of people think
[33:37] they said oh it's just intellectualism
[33:40] well then where has your spirituality
[33:42] broadly right not something them say my
[33:45] sarcastic understand it like it is where
[33:49] is what you think is the great
[33:51] spirituality that if it's not you know
[33:55] if it's just if we have the word
[33:57] intellectually there's one thing about
[33:58] it we've got the word in the field Oh
[34:00] God gotta do this quick it but if you
[34:02] don't have it to feel you can't quit my
[34:04] job you go ahead see that's what we're
[34:07] doing we're allowing the devil to beat
[34:10] upon us to the basis that we're cutting
[34:12] off what God really wants to do I don't
[34:17] bring bread around made that statement
[34:18] one down you know it really shocked me
[34:20] said God wants you healed more than you
[34:25] would be healed no only who I'm not
[34:32] thinking about them and I'm sorry I'm
[34:35] just talked like I am but you don't have
[34:39] a lot of people in this world would
[34:42] never admit there he'll even if they
[34:45] will just doesn't want to draw her
[34:48] Social Security check Rep know what you
[34:52] one college yeah we're landing at work
[34:55] that I admire him he went out on a
[34:59] medical retirement on his nerves and you
[35:03] know he said it had some antique
[35:05] abstaining so he begged him let him come
[35:08] back to work he's already retired that
[35:11] everything sealed up house he go out on
[35:13] your nerves you when talking about a nub
[35:14] doctor who says you back to work and you
[35:18] know that put him back to work you know
[35:21] I'm Marty
[35:25] because he he wanted to get back to work
[35:29] he didn't want to let lay around he
[35:31] could light around draw it almost as
[35:33] much money as he did work I'm learning
[35:37] for them so you because that man he had
[35:38] something with me but not get my point I
[35:42] believe God is trying to reveal to you
[35:45] and I'm who we are and revealing who we
[35:53] are is automatically resilience al-abed
[35:58] because that's who it is you remember
[36:01] how we were bringing out the other day
[36:02] that then you go through just just one
[36:04] incoming of Revelations one and then
[36:07] when you get a chapter 2 a 3 so
[36:08] dramatically red-letter all the way it's
[36:11] showing Jesus Christ in His Church it's
[36:14] not showing just the Turk it's the
[36:19] revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's
[36:22] doing down to the seven churches in his
[36:25] bride see then we look at Devon we say
[36:30] well we don't I just don't know I don't
[36:34] know God has already read that all about
[36:36] you and i we're not writing it brother
[36:41] cure it's not something we've got to
[36:43] make manifest from God can write it down
[36:46] right he's already wrote it out of what
[36:51] it was going to be now you think you
[36:54] don't change his mind no he's just
[37:01] wanting you and I believe it but she
[37:05] seems that you start talking like that
[37:07] and people just sign up on but you get
[37:14] to talking about how that they run
[37:16] around Carla jano pathless holding its
[37:19] turn up and get up lead it moon so happy
[37:22] or preach some false doctrine and
[37:25] they're just all over the place when you
[37:30] just simply start talking about the word
[37:34] no let's do a slow listener well where's
[37:37] your spirituality brother right you said
[37:42] well it's like not happening around
[37:43] little show me worse having anymore come
[37:50] on I've told you before i put up his
[37:54] church against any church and this
[37:55] message as to why he's taking buddy's
[37:57] and the signs and wonders has been among
[38:00] us that's not bragging that telling the
[38:02] truth would you see we're make that
[38:07] we're letting the devil take away from
[38:09] us the opportunity to be what he's
[38:12] already said we are he's already wrote
[38:17] the book about us the book of Revelation
[38:19] is your book it's written about to
[38:24] details every age and what it is sure
[38:29] there was the bad part that's all people
[38:31] would leave after that heart cause you
[38:36] had to speak to two churches remember
[38:39] the true vinyl in the fox run is in the
[38:43] church ages but the true vine always got
[38:46] the promise to the overcame night event
[38:49] and what is the last one to sit with me
[38:52] in my throne as I sit my father and his
[38:56] from now that's the promise in the last
[38:59] days that you and I are to sit in the
[39:02] word could you remember the last message
[39:05] what was it the Word made flesh Jesus
[39:12] Christ was the Word made flesh we accept
[39:17] that but then when you come down through
[39:20] the ages well it don't go up there what
[39:23] was it the Living God manifesting
[39:29] himself right the Word made flesh right
[39:36] right and the thing that it is we are to
[39:39] come down here until according to do
[39:42] melech ha for we are to be turned back
[39:44] to the fight right the father's right
[39:48] but where do you hear that top does it's
[39:53] just this great big thing that we're in
[39:55] our the great Nuland or whatever you
[39:58] know in Russia Sean so really he's got
[40:01] that going down man what going all I'm
[40:07] trying to bring to you that is the
[40:09] reality of one thing God has already
[40:14] said what this bride will be in in time
[40:17] right they don't matter to me how many
[40:20] Devils in he'll have to take that away
[40:23] it ain't gonna change but then we don't
[40:26] believe we're part of it you know what
[40:29] we're on if we can't accept what God
[40:34] said about you and I we can't do it the
[40:41] prophet of God I gave it to you there
[40:43] the other we can get it back to you
[40:44] tonight one-on-one against organized
[40:46] religion look what he says born from
[40:49] above you can read it turn flesh word
[40:54] flesh in you we gotta be born from above
[40:59] not going from the earth born from above
[41:04] look what he says and flees to the
[41:06] trumpets right down below it number two
[41:07] that the Word made flesh gives the light
[41:10] of the age the Word made flesh is the
[41:17] light of the image now you show me
[41:20] worded that down through the ages that
[41:22] that work with my flesh and those people
[41:26] see if we don't want to look at it
[41:28] anyway then when we do then we can't
[41:31] accept the fact of what God says about
[41:33] this ain't the word has got to be made
[41:40] flesh in you and the probably said
[41:43] spoken words original signal for you
[41:45] enough that
[41:46] birth of the word is Christ amen man
[41:52] living in email the word
[42:02] hmm John 15 pfizer what I told met a
[42:06] woman who I am the vine you are the
[42:08] branches we burned the fruit we're under
[42:18] the fruit let me see if we doubt what
[42:22] kind of fruit it is or what God has said
[42:25] about us how can he do anything I'm
[42:33] always told you about you know that the
[42:35] guy that broke that left four minute
[42:37] mile with postal never walk who never
[42:42] been able to run to know what they
[42:45] forgot to tell me you know what he broke
[42:50] four minute mile why because he didn't
[42:56] live in itself the bumble bees wings
[43:00] fred is so small until it is impossible
[43:03] for him to fly would you know that it's
[43:09] nick till the bumblebee Jill if I could
[43:15] ever get it to anyone fly just getting
[43:20] you to at least go did fun see where
[43:24] we're making ourselves to the basis that
[43:26] we're not taking what the scripture says
[43:28] about us we want to know what it said a
[43:35] lot somebody else like I said where is
[43:38] it important to find it that run around
[43:42] coming to John Pappas I want to know who
[43:45] trying to bring around because that way
[43:50] he can speak to me
[43:57] alright see you by the fruit the Spirit
[44:05] gives life to the word but if we don't
[44:09] have the word where are we just when I'm
[44:12] always just drive it in one thing preach
[44:14] the word huh if the words in the field
[44:22] Holy Spirit can quicken that where I had
[44:24] a min but if it's not in back here
[44:28] another dose already shown them apart
[44:30] from man's grief the holy ghost came
[44:32] Flicka did he can't let a lot of high
[44:37] word false alert do you never happen you
[44:42] never will but you see God has already
[44:47] told what is going to happen in this day
[44:53] do you ever have you ever really just
[44:56] sat down and listened to run around
[44:58] preach and think he's talking about me
[45:02] if nothing else come on did nothing else
[45:07] realize he talking about today you're
[45:09] living in when he would he'll say Fang
[45:18] and you can turn right around and see it
[45:20] taking place but why can't we realize he
[45:26] talking about us who's he talking about
[45:29] where are you still move there's no Lucy
[45:33] that let's go kill us that's what's
[45:37] taking this to the grave in the Bible it
[45:43] says I know whenever jokes it I know
[45:53] then there's no question who's Eddie
[45:57] none right well maybe no no it's a he
[46:02] said I know my redeemer live do you know
[46:06] your redeemer lives why are we cutting
[46:14] God short to the basis that he cannot
[46:16] make manifest among us what he wants to
[46:20] say i want to see God made many things I
[46:25] want to praise him for what he's doing I
[46:29] want to praise him for what he had done
[46:31] but I want to see him living the reality
[46:36] in our lives not to just sit around go
[46:41] to church and be good you know we're
[46:44] done just getting older you right out
[46:51] but look go down to number seven on your
[46:56] nose I'm just trying to shorten else get
[46:59] the point of what i want you to see
[47:10] Christianity versus on dollar tree I
[47:13] Drive 190 190 61 1217 you saw matter we
[47:21] are made part partakers of his holiness
[47:23] we in His image we are living in our
[47:27] living images of living gone right then
[47:31] Davis elf raised with him now listen
[47:35] listen to this His Word made flesh again
[47:38] and us over the Neville look what is it
[47:44] not the mythical imaginary god sitting
[47:49] out there but the Living God aim is not
[47:52] what it says what is the Living God
[47:57] money sonny the word in you making
[48:03] itself real now it's is where they read
[48:08] that wording brother branham making
[48:09] several where Jesus made several but
[48:14] what did he say the word in you making
[48:17] it slippery wait glory to God oh I know
[48:20] you think I'm a holy roller maybe I am
[48:23] no brother do you see it triumph over
[48:26] ever denomination triumph over all
[48:28] paganism a living God made manifest in a
[48:32] living temple and the Word of God which
[48:35] is God is my flesh in You amen what is
[48:41] the Living God the word in you making it
[48:50] sort of read the words the thoughts are
[48:54] not is what the revealed Word admit we
[48:58] don't like the word my flesh what about
[48:59] to reveal work you know if it's not
[49:01] revealed came in my flesh but do we
[49:05] realize see that's my point if I tried
[49:09] to do for meeting for I don't know 20
[49:11] years now more I had one
[49:13] in mind to get you and I to look at the
[49:17] book of revelations and to see that that
[49:20] is the book that tells you in hi who we
[49:23] are and what we're doing and what's
[49:25] taking place upon the earth while we're
[49:27] here that's my book the symbols has been
[49:37] broke the profit is told us that's what
[49:45] I was trying to show there I but you
[49:47] know of Revelations 113 through that
[49:49] word speaks of the one stand in the
[49:51] midst of seven golden candlesticks heard
[49:53] about the path for the gold and their
[49:54] families for profits need a bride
[49:57] standing Drona we need to remember this
[50:02] statement that I made two three times
[50:04] before he ever wrote one word about the
[50:08] church ages he'd already showed how
[50:10] perfect time that the bride of Jesus
[50:13] Christ is before he ever said one thing
[50:16] about the bad things of the church ages
[50:19] he already showed how perfectly on he'd
[50:23] already taken the bride and revelations
[50:25] one all the way to the white throne to
[50:28] sit on the throne with him you remember
[50:29] that join how perfect of what he thinks
[50:34] of you and I did he starts talking about
[50:37] the church ages and showing what would
[50:44] actually transpire upon earth before he
[50:49] never even transpired what about a god
[50:54] that could write a prophecy to you not
[50:56] so perfect to show us exactly where we
[50:58] are we believe we're in the seventh
[51:01] search Hetty so what is the message to
[51:03] the seven churches the beginning of the
[51:05] creation of gone and the Prophet said
[51:10] he's the beginning of the creation he
[51:12] said where the rest for that creative
[51:13] look what God has already shown you and
[51:17] I'm he's already shown us perfect
[51:24] already showing us in a rapture who get
[51:27] threatened revelation full one already
[51:32] shown us he never form to be eternal
[51:37] already shown us the city we would
[51:39] actually live me well if I could just
[51:45] find myself in the month when man
[51:50] standing right here one night he said
[51:51] boy I tell you what I found myself he

[54:42] the time you come out right amen cause
[54:46] it'll be right I believe that but you
[54:49] can take either one element Liam either
[54:51] way you want to write me with the
[54:53] Prophet come to turn us back to the word
[54:55] amen we were supposed to be turned back
[54:59] to the face of the fathers hello the end
[55:02] the things could happen of the sealed
[55:04] opening the great things to transpire to
[55:07] let us know other times but you see the
[55:11] revealed Word will straighten out the
[55:13] era that is in each one of us amen John
[55:21] sew on patch
[55:25] listen the Lord Jesus Christ the moon
[55:35] not probably physically standing there
[55:39] you know in a corporal body because they
[55:43] would not fit what the point that you're
[55:45] getting too he saw him in Brad form he
[55:53] saw him in the form that God wanted to
[55:58] be to be in his church Johnny so what
[56:07] Jesus was bringing him there God had
[56:11] revealed John some hood it wasn't just
[56:21] an angel telling John John actually saw
[56:25] Jesus standing there they saw anyone
[56:30] brothel
[56:37] he saw you why can't we believe that no
[56:48] one of these days yeah journal pathless
[56:55] saw the Word made flesh in the bride now
[57:02] just run around instead I'm looking unto
[57:06] Jesus and he gave it to you that John
[57:08] the Baptist was the greatest of all
[57:12] number laelia note of all the profits
[57:16] because he saw the Word made flesh
[57:21] Laurette said the other prophets of
[57:23] visions and things John so the Word made
[57:29] flesh but REM sleep that's why he was
[57:32] the greatest of all the prophets and he
[57:36] introduced he behold the lamb of God
[57:40] that takes away the sin in the world
[57:43] john de nino miracles there was not one
[57:48] miracle and John the Baptist his
[57:50] ministry we get everybody wants miracles
[57:54] and signs and wonders I do to become we
[57:58] need even look gimme work then a sound
[58:06] and wonders will follow the word well
[58:11] I've heard you prayed for 40 years and
[58:14] what have you done in the 40 years
[58:18] you've been listening to me this it's
[58:24] just time to be flattened blunt and
[58:26] forget it
[58:31] remember Joe no Padma saw the word
[58:35] that's John the Revelator you know I'm
[58:37] Patman saw the word that john the
[58:40] baptist south on earth John sees in the
[58:48] Book of Revelations the same word made
[58:52] flesh but is in a meeting everybody amen
[58:59] whereas John the Baptist only saw one
[59:03] man John the baddest it behold the lamb
[59:13] of God brother branham I got it later
[59:17] meant to bring it on back to me when I
[59:19] get it to you the other day but a brown
[59:23] said this last night messenger would be
[59:24] pointing to a word born bride right into
[59:31] coming of Jesus Christ to a were born
[59:35] bride John so the revealed Word of each
[59:43] age the code you wrote in chapter 23 are
[59:49] you anyway he saw it so much he wrote it
[59:53] to worth it though the authors when they
[59:55] come along the translators in a
[59:57] different thing when they picked it up
[59:59] they could see that with Jesus leading
[1:00:03] that's a reasonably red letter right cuz
[1:00:08] they could see that was personal he was
[1:00:11] not revealing the world it's hurt he was
[1:00:17] revealing himself in the ride David he
[1:00:22] was showing himself into messengers and
[1:00:27] the candlesticks the bride he
[1:00:33] we're promised in this last days that
[1:00:36] merica I for is to restore the original
[1:00:41] word the original word would mean to be
[1:00:50] be bringing the bride back to the
[1:00:52] original position God showed that
[1:00:59] picture in the book of Revelation a what
[1:01:03] Malachi 4 was seeing
[1:01:12] your prophet of God said on one see not
[1:01:15] our to shut number not only knows what
[1:01:17] that in the last days the full word
[1:01:20] would be born into manifestation the
[1:01:26] full word would be born in the
[1:01:31] manifestation the seaters where it goes
[1:01:34] back again well I just don't clear well
[1:01:37] then you know what the problem is you
[1:01:43] what what you've done if you've been
[1:01:45] standing there when john turned around
[1:01:46] and said behold the lamb of god it takes
[1:01:48] away the sin of the world would you been
[1:01:50] hard and crucified what would it be they
[1:02:01] don't doubt the full word now you know
[1:02:10] what happens if you doctor foo work turn
[1:02:14] over to look at number 10 you know this
[1:02:19] 22 Easter seal 1965 14 he that
[1:02:23] disbelieves don't believe forward what
[1:02:29] are you the Prophet says you're a sinner
[1:02:33] now I didn't say that's your profits it
[1:02:36] read it you doubt the full word number
[1:02:41] 10 he that believes not the full Word of
[1:02:46] God is a sinner that's pretty rough
[1:02:53] inning
[1:02:57] look on down to the next one number 11
[1:03:03] moderate events made clear by prophecy
[1:03:05] 65 1206 progressed 78 and when a man's
[1:03:09] born of the Spirit of God he don't
[1:03:11] inject anything in through his Blythe
[1:03:14] it's unadulterated Word of God
[1:03:17] vindicated for that hour he takes the
[1:03:20] full word of god he don't put no Creed's
[1:03:23] nothing else into it it's purely
[1:03:25] unadulterated God's Word made manifest
[1:03:29] among what about are we sure will happen
[1:03:40] that brother Dale I believe the words
[1:03:41] here you'd run around well I guess that
[1:03:47] fulfills a whole book of Revelation and
[1:03:53] I guess we better be in effect me true
[1:03:55] in that line we better hope that that
[1:03:57] was brought around to come to John atmos
[1:03:59] where we have an opportunity to receive
[1:04:01] something better hope that was pretty
[1:04:06] random and coming but you see the Book
[1:04:16] of Revelations is not written about the
[1:04:19] Prophet is written about the bride the
[1:04:25] prophets got his part what could be
[1:04:27] greater if he a spread around the day
[1:04:31] what would be greater he said to be able
[1:04:33] to introduce the word John the Baptist
[1:04:37] introduced the word to the world what
[1:04:40] Gregor was there any signs or wonders
[1:04:42] that he needed did he need any proof did
[1:04:45] he need any great halo light did he need
[1:04:47] anything to prove what he's safe no but
[1:04:53] what about brother Brandon he said not
[1:04:58] call you Brian I call you Brad I like
[1:05:05] that you know identified masterpiece 64
[1:05:09] 1205 how we're going to come to heaven
[1:05:12] then the state how we going to come to
[1:05:16] heaven then to say well I believe this
[1:05:19] but I don't believe that now you're
[1:05:22] gonna do it you've got to be the full
[1:05:26] word for your part of him your part of
[1:05:35] him he's showing us in the Book of
[1:05:39] Revelations now this is the foundation
[1:05:43] for what I'm doing Sonny effect he's
[1:05:47] shown her
[1:05:53] he doesn't show himself he shows himself
[1:05:56] in her what greater honor could be given
[1:06:03] to any people then for God to call us
[1:06:08] his children for him to make us his
[1:06:15] people for him to say that he's not
[1:06:19] complete without your name and to turn
[1:06:24] around in the book of Revelation and
[1:06:26] show us so beautiful and marvelous that
[1:06:35] he shows us growing up in Revelations
[1:06:37] for one now the lord willing what I want
[1:06:43] to do sundays get on to something that
[1:06:45] is going to take a while to understand
[1:06:48] it's like I told you why didn't that
[1:06:51] angel it read a random was with him from
[1:06:53] birth why did that angel not tell him
[1:06:55] about to see he told him a lot of the
[1:06:59] other things but I come he didn't tell
[1:07:02] you about to see
[1:07:08] hmm
[1:07:11] he called that a minor angel oh of
[1:07:14] course he's only trying to deceive his
[1:07:16] home whatever i think you know it's what
[1:07:23] to do to people told brother Richard I'm
[1:07:27] not ported this is a quote did they said
[1:07:31] well around cities you if you you make
[1:07:36] me Jesus Christ you make me auntie
[1:07:37] crises oh he just said that to throw you
[1:07:39] off put it on a good job so he told me
[1:07:45] so far off I don't believe he's jesus
[1:07:47] christ but do you understand brother
[1:07:57] branham see that Jesus Christ is here
[1:08:01] amen exactly that's number 13 him you
[1:08:09] know it's really hard graft 40 state
[1:08:12] come hither quickly he said outside of
[1:08:16] the Corporal body there's no different
[1:08:18] than what he was back tired when he
[1:08:21] isn't but do we believe that I just
[1:08:28] can't I just can't see it better there
[1:08:30] cuz if it was we'd be seeing great signs
[1:08:33] and wonders we are the greatest sign I'm
[1:08:40] the greatest wonder that could ever be
[1:08:43] is to see a group of people that would
[1:08:48] struggle and fight for actually
[1:08:51] existence of life but to stay with the
[1:08:56] message of the hour and try to keep it
[1:08:59] pure and unadulterated from all creeds
[1:09:01] and ideas like velocity is the greatest
[1:09:06] miracle is for somebody to get yourself
[1:09:09] out of the way extending the pulpit and
[1:09:11] God use them to speak his work
[1:09:18] what you see John saw in Revelations 113
[1:09:28] the bride of Jesus Christ already
[1:09:33] perfectly beautifully marvelously decked
[1:09:36] out be like one like a son of man and
[1:09:43] got were around me what he called it
[1:09:44] there you know what he told that did he
[1:09:48] saw her he caught it too son of God not
[1:09:53] to suddenly you can't have some man
[1:09:58] until you first get some gum back that's
[1:10:05] why that angel couldn't tell her to read
[1:10:10] he couldn't tell because the revelation
[1:10:15] had not come forth from God and the same
[1:10:20] is enough will
[1:10:25] then where would be the problem of
[1:10:31] coming back to revelations one and
[1:10:36] seeing that this was the revelation that
[1:10:38] God gives you Jesus to give the John and
[1:10:42] sent and signified by the angel what
[1:10:47] would be the difference in saying this
[1:10:50] is the revelation of the bride of Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ that God gave to an angel to
[1:11:00] deliver unto his bride and then that he
[1:11:06] himself would step on the scene and
[1:11:10] manifest himself but did any difference
[1:11:15] in that Brotherhood and they are saying
[1:11:18] that will not reach yourself in that
[1:11:21] we're not read that this is the
[1:11:23] revelation that God give to Jesus to
[1:11:25] tell about us right now I selective on
[1:11:31] down a little bit nuts make far enough
[1:11:33] it's nothing like far enough you know
[1:11:37] what it is it's exactly the truth
[1:11:42] because Jesus the revelation that he
[1:11:45] didn't understand when he was on earth
[1:11:52] was his part in the kingdom it's what
[1:11:57] your prophet said he didn't understand
[1:12:03] this hey didn't understand where he was
[1:12:06] got or not I come on he was but he
[1:12:12] didn't know his part in the team Dean
[1:12:17] that I knows his part become to tell us
[1:12:20] about his part you know what he does he
[1:12:22] never tells it without you and I
[1:12:24] involved in it that's the way I looked
[1:12:31] at the Bible you will find yourself read
[1:12:36] The Book of Revelations you can find out
[1:12:39] all this going to happen but you see we
[1:12:46] can't get it all comprehended the comes
[1:12:50] we got to get our brain involved how did
[1:12:54] the bride can go up revelations for one
[1:12:56] and not seen until revelations 1921 very
[1:13:03] mondo comprehend
[1:13:09] attachments your prophecy
[1:13:14] why because she's gonna know the rest of
[1:13:20] it is Israel in the dribble ice pack and
[1:13:22] working on he thought so much of us he
[1:13:25] takes us up before the tribulation you
[1:13:31] see he's trying to reveal himself in
[1:13:34] Bride phone the revealed Word of the age
[1:13:39] that you and I are leaving it to see
[1:13:44] Christ made manifest that's always on my
[1:13:48] heart read the book of revelations and
[1:13:52] see what it says about you may I don't
[1:13:59] understand all in symbols you prophet
[1:14:01] told us to sing know you're trying to
[1:14:07] figure out Antichrist big beast walking
[1:14:10] around all kind of thing have my King
[1:14:12] Kong for something like it as soon as
[1:14:16] you see it that the whole Bible is
[1:14:20] revealed Jesus Christ and the last book
[1:14:26] is not revealing himself he's revealing
[1:14:32] himself in you and I that's the greatest
[1:14:37] of all revelation what do you think
[1:14:43] about
[1:14:47] you want to see yourself read the book
[1:14:49] of Revelation Thank on this time but
[1:14:57] this is my sport outro bang this is what
[1:15:00] John saw in Revelations 113 he saw the
[1:15:05] word made alive in the people the
[1:15:13] revealed Word the word made a lot come
[1:15:18] on decisions what do you think about yes
[1:15:25] but if we could just see histories see
[1:15:28] her we're cutting it off see we're
[1:15:31] letting ourselves if we thank her so
[1:15:33] spiritual stop God from being able to do

[1:16:37] bride of Jesus Christ we are the word
[1:16:43] that's made of life for this day see we
