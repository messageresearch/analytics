we can see Lord and continue to send any word To Us by Revelation father God that we can walk in these bodies as you have said we would Lord is to represent you here on this Earth is what uh you've said we are Lord and it's hard for us father God forgive us Lord of our I've seen that we just can't always accept the fact that we're made perfect just like you father but your word says it so let's nail it down and let's just put it in our hearts that your word says it that's all we need to know we don't need to discount it we don't need to try to figure it out or nothing just take your word at what it says Lord and you said father would be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that we'd receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so that father help me Lord and there's other scriptures you gave me along the way in my journey father that I know I'm blessed by Your Word coming forth father and we ask Lord that you just touch and bless those that couldn't be here today and whatever the Hindus are but that's a little bride around the world that's being cried and father I'd ask you to just lift each one up and strengthen us father God and bless brother Wade this morning as he's preparing to bring you work to us Lord God and most of all we came to hear your word we want to hear it Lord and we want you to reveal it to us so father we can do these things that you've said we would we ask now father to go to the reading of your word you just come on the scene Lord and bless us that we don't say anything or do anything to harm and hinder anybody and bless that little bride around the world we asked it in your name and thank you for this beautiful place you've given us Lord to come and be with this little family today I asked in your name Jesus Christ amen as we go to Psalms 46 God is our refuge and strength and a very present help and trouble though the waters there of Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof sealer God is in the midst of her I love that she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Selah foreign to the end of the Earth he breakthy bow and cutth the spirit in asunder he burneth The Chariot in the fire amen the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Selah thinking you may be seated think of the word amen that is a wonderful chapter to keep in memory and rot it down when you're feeling discouraged that's one of my favorite scriptures God is our refuge and strength of present help and trouble and then he's in the midst of her and then be still and know that I'm God I mean those are powerful promises we can always put our faith and rely on Amen where's Morty at brother Morty could you come up here and take this morning

world what us sinners being dead and trespassing sin God who is rich in Mercy he brought you here he calls you you answered what a mighty God we serve what a person that we can is the Bible as we were saying the song There we know the Creator we know the master of the Winds not Solomon hearsay it's not somebody I got to go to a a priest again or or a pope or a bishop no I can talk to him I called Tim this morning I hope y'all didn't too and man I already talked to him if y'all ain't talked to him you need to talk to him before we get started because somebody else has probably been talking to you between that time hello you're either gonna get two voices well maybe three maybe you get yours in every once in a while but the devil's gonna get his then but let's let God have his perfect will today and let it be as the song says well with My Soul think about that song so much about how that man went through so much trial and tribulation we think we went through a lot he lost almost his whole family drowned in the sea and when he went right through the same place the captain said right here's right here is where you where the Shipwreck was and he looks up in these pins the song it is well when peace like a river when Sorrows like what sees Bellows roll whatever my light it is well with My Soul it don't it's not gonna be well with your body all the time it's not going to be well with your spirit all the time but we pray to God that it today you are settled that it's well in your soul and when it's well in your soul it will I promise work its way out in a minute so let's um let's make a few announcements if you want to sit down we got a special today we want to um honor a couple guys Jonas come here Sophia come here I like your boots man you didn't know he's gonna he's gonna call you up here dude hey about the same these two guys now um if you've got somebody in your family that that do certain extracurricular things then we'd like to um announce it and um and to bring it to everybody's attention but they're in archery and a bow and arrow and they have been doing it since they were young and and I've tried to help them a little bit with my limited information that I have but their dad's really been good they've been taught by some good people and they went to a tournament last weekend in Owensboro Kentucky and uh Sophia this was a national tournament out inside indoor tournament and Sophia got third place and Jonas got 11th Place you get a little older there's more people to have to shoot against but they went yesterday to Social Circle Sophia got first place and Jonas got third place and they shoot their little bow and arrow and I promise you one thing he's not going to have a problem with this one having a boyfriend our shooting him if he gets out of line 20 yards she knocked a button off his shirt you just had to you girls don't do don't shoot girls don't shoot the girls shoot the boys don't shoot the girls but we aren't too um to uh acknowledge them today that they have they've tried hard they get out in the backyard uh most of the time I go over there and they're out there shooting their bows with their dad and even mom has now gotta got a long bow or a recurve bow and she's out there shooting at trees and rocks and she has to Target yet probably not okay I didn't think so but she's trying so let's give him a big ham they're going to continue to compete and uh you can sit down now and we appreciate it that's something I uh Joe and I were talking about the other day I went to one ahead over in Banks County and there was other people there that were that had on long dresses Pentecostal long dresses and had long hair and I know one of them she works with us at the post office but that's something you can get your kids into without them having to wear a pair of shorts or tights or or show theirself off they can go out there in their little dress and they can you know and they're long hair they keep it tied back and they just shoot for the glory of the Lord amen but I appreciate that I appreciate brother Joe and sister Rachel spending the time and uh and um I know Richard wherever Richard's at Richard okay Richard does the same thing with his his kids he's getting them tuned up and they're in 4-H so they shoot Thomas and uh and Abby Grace so we uh we appreciate it everything we do with our youth we try to help as much as we can but you parents are the ones that's going to have to be their God until they get the Holy Ghost and then you're going to have to lead them and guide them and help them into the things that they do so we appreciate all of you didn't want a single one person out but I wanted to give them a a good hand there because they've succeeded the last two weeks to uh to tear that Target up at 10 yards and 20 yards so well and that will help them one next week start all start hunting together maybe we can we can bring home some venison for some of you so let's stand up to our feet and uh let's turn them where we always been in the John 1 verse 1. a couple more announcements remember it's already announced brother Aaron is that brother Andre heads just today brother Louise is it brother Tony uboa's uh interpreting form for a brother down there and also brother Aaron will be speaking Wednesday I'll let him know um this coming Saturday will be the youth service at three o'clock brother Jack Duff will be with us uh we're I think we're going to do hot dogs you need to talk to Jim about what to do and to volunteer all right to do that starting at three o'clock we'll eat about 4 30 and then we'll have activities afterwards young kids and then we'll have some things to do for the uh for the young adults so just remember that also Sunday uh then that same Sunday brother Jack Duff will be with us on Sunday morning we will not have a second service because we'll have the Saturday and then we'll have Sunday service just remember that and then also this afternoon uh the church was so gracious through brother Dale to give brother Luis the three thousand dollars he needed for the for the gentleman or the brother that needed to build the uh uh kitchen and all that but that's only half of what he needs he really needs six thousand dollars but Luis was is going to ask some others to contribute but today this afternoon we're going to take up an offering the offering this afternoon will go to brother Louise to go toward that that three thousand dollars that the church has already given we sure appreciate brother Louise to give us those um needs and and for him to go there and brother Bob now going there and and to see some of the things they were in the home that we that though I say we we as a church paid for it to build and we appreciate that so uh we will this afternoon with the whole offering everything we collect this afternoon will be for brother Louise uh to give to the brother to add to the three thousand dollars for the um uh you know you can you can imagine we and I know sometimes we get cramped here but could you imagine living in a house that your church used the bathroom your church used the bedroom for the study for the pastor you you you use your own kitchen for the kitchen like downstairs if we all live downstairs could you imagine all that it's it's kind of rough and it's rough on equipment it's rough on families for privacy and everything so that's why brother Louise said she was showing those pictures that there's a need to build an outside kitchen and a restroom for them to uh to facilitate the church that they're going to and we sure appreciate the Lord for allowing us to be able to help so let's bow our heads I think that's all we got today dear heavenly father thank you for this word that you give us thank you for the brothers and sisters Lord the songs have been sung offering Lord all these things have been done Lord now I pray you just sanctify us now for the furthermen of this service for the word is going forth Lord you do the speaking Lord let the hearers Lord listen Lord not with ears on each side of their head Lord but the hearing of the heart that it'll go all the way down deep and settle in there and that we will stay at the end of this service it is well with My Soul father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes be with the ones Lord we we see that some have come back from the sickness and we appreciate that for for helping their bodies Lord to heal I pray this should continue to be with the ones that are not here Sister Mary had already different ones it's Freedom the ones if we forget somebody sister Johnny Lord we miss them and we'd love for them to see him Lord again it breaks our heart every time anybody uh can't come to church that really really wants to Lord so I pray this you'll just bless each one today father in Jesus name amen all right we're on son of man part 94. today we're going to talk a little bit about finish with Temperance and start on patience in the beginning was the word where it was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that's what we're focusing on his glory and his honor because he's going to what he's going to take that honor and do what with it give it to us he's gonna give that honor brother Brown said we are his victory in other words we are his glory we are his crown there's not physical crowns are okay but but the crowning Glory of Jesus Christ is his bride yes all right so let's read second Peter 1 verse 5 and says beside this give me diligence add to your faith virtue now we've been through all these to Virtue knowledge we talk about knowledge just for a second the knowledge Temperance the temperance patience and the patience godliness in Luke 21 verse 19. the Bible says in your patience possess ye your souls let's be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word now remember we've been talking that that God has a plan and a purpose in Christ the mystery God revealed brother Brown said see God had a plan and a purpose his plan and purpose was to get us back to the original amen get us back to the Garden of Eden that's the only time we want to go back we want to go back to that Garden of Eden condition all right before the fall So the plan was and he knew what was going to happen to man so he formed a plan to bring us back all right and he knew though that man had to be part of the plan that he put man on free moral agency so here's man out here amen he knew man would fall he knew we would do what we did he knew what would happen in the Garden of Eden my man so he had a plan already in his mind and a purpose what so that he could display his attributes of Savior and heal and Redeemer all the different things that we as we were I was singing we were all singing just a few minutes ago I mean that's the Adoration our voice to God is the Adoration that we give to the Lord because behind those songs and I actually was looking up who wrote these songs and Bill Gaither wrote one he touched me and and I think one of the hemp Hills wrote the other song and then you got Horatio spafford wrote there's always something behind a song and it's an inspiration that God gives these people that's why I've told him many times before that sometimes you look at these contemporary songs and you really don't care about the listen to the person that sings it but if you take your inspiration you take your anointing that you have and put it with those words and it doesn't sound like a rock concert then everything's fine because the words are inspired listen God's word is inspired there's an inspired voice speaking to me and you today and it's the plan that he's got that we don't have to go through 40 or 50 books one what one book right and then as we've been saying many times before then what we have to do is as God has made this a method of achieving an end well that's what a plan means or a detailed formulation of a program of action there's no other program can't change it won't change it there's not a middle of the road uh oops or or at the in the middle of the football game we got to change everything that's not what we're the word of God word of God's true can't change he can't change his mind he already knew what was going to happen and he formulated this plan the problem is is we got into sin and sin did what sin clouded up the picture it made it where we couldn't get to God we had to we had to get somebody to go into the holy of holies and take our confession to to a god that was an Angry God a God that that if you looked in the Old Testament like brother Ryan said he always thought God hated me or Jehovah hated me and Jesus loved me come to find out the same person what he had done was he had moved from this form to this form over here but the blood of bulls and goats could only cover sin where it eradicated sin on this side and to eradicate sin means how how many of us would love today to have all of our thoughts that we had all of our negative and I'm going to just say it evil thoughts yeah today just erased oh hallelujah oh wouldn't that make it much better for Eva for tomorrow yeah be here for tomorrow if I could just forget everything I did from their back well guess what there's one person that did and he's still doing it and that's God Almighty and so what we're going to do is is we're going to trust his plan and not try to figure out one ourself because man has tried to get into this door and that door but listen there was one door what one door into that holy of holies not a side door not a back door there was one door and you had to go through that door so who is our door Jesus Christ is that door he's the way the truth and the life he is the door keeper and that's what we got to go through so he's give us then this plan and he's given us an option to be born again three more agencies give you an option to be born again or whether you do or don't it's your choice and then as we get into that plan though it's not just that that plan stopped no that's just the beginning of the plan then we as we as we grow up and God we look back and yeah we see that we started somewhere foreign but in our journey the Bible says like impatience possess ye your souls and we'll read a quote with brother Brown and I've seen it just in my short time and I know brother Dale has different ones that you see these people that are on fire for God it's like burning the candle at both ends or brother around set a house on fire on the wind today they just come in and they absolutely just love it they sit on the front row this is the greatest thing it ever was six months later they disappear well they didn't get the right to writing with I'd rather have somebody sit around sit right bug eyed close-eyed I fit that in there didn't I then for you to say this is it I've got it all and then never see you again right that's not part of the plan of God that's part of the plan that he knew was going to take place over here I'm talking about the place I want to be it's that part right there where it says add if I'm born again I must add God to me I'm not adding me to God I'm adding God to me right I want God to come and me be like God and myself I can't go to God because that priest went behind the veil when he come back out he was even a sinner the only thing special about him do you know the answer the only special about him was his lineage it's lineage that's all how he was born he was born in the levite Lenny so he you know of course he had to go through certain things but but he was a high priest not because of his good works and not because of his good looks and not because of Any lap he was a high priest because of lineage well guess what you and I are the same way we're High priests because of the lineage of almighty God not of the Linens in here down here on the earth so that's why we can be high priests going boldly to the throne of grace but remember we can go to that Throne because being Sinners though we can't go any further without God right so God the Lord Jesus that's why I said the other day we got to take our we got to take our our needs and all of our things that we need we take them to Jesus and we give them to him and he gives them to the father now that's not two or three different people that's an act of a play that's part of the plan father protect them Father father amen and his brother Brandon was always his illustration you know he said he said you know the the Corporal body of Jesus is laying on an altar somewhere it's not laying there like this it has come to a place to where we see that that that altar is him himself not just him sitting on an altar or laying on an altar remember in in Revelations 5 he was a bloody lamb but he wasn't laying on an altar he was standing up and he had a book in his hand he had conquered something and he said give me that book and he took the book and he opened the book of redemption to me and you but so impatience be patient as we've said many times before we get this from from Dave Ramsey he was talking about you know your financial uh information and all your financial things should be a crock pot it should not be a microwave it's not there's no get rich quick scheme so listen there's no get rich quick quick and God either it's a plan it's got something but you know why it's a plan you said well why that's what he told us we were going to have to go through every step has to be purposed by God to add to your new birth to add to what you previously didn't have before everybody with me add that word means minister or nourish and then we're talking about the word of God we were we were having dinner with Lily and Zach last night and they stay up kind of late kept us old people up but we were at their house so anyhow they they want us to leave Liz said honey we need to be quiet so they can go home everything you can have all the other career and you have the job you can have the greatest this and the greatest but without the unadulterated word of God a place to go to church a place to go to put your not your name on a book but to see your name on a book amen not to put your name on the book but to see that it's already written there praise the Lord so what's the most important thing the word of God put God first and then all these other things will take care of itself because as human beings there's certain things we don't like I like to hunt Michael probably wouldn't care less about going deer hunting getting up in the morning going hunting but that don't make him any less Christian than I am don't make him any less a man than we are we just got to forget all this up and down and that's what's going to happen when we get up to Godliness and brotherly kindness everything is going to have to even out there can't be this because that's what happens when you come to the outer Court remember brother Brown explains that is in justification he said you're standing in the outer Court when it rains you get wet because there's nothing to cover you so you have good days and bad days you have days that looks like that out there amen then you have days that are sunny but but thank God for a prophet that filled in the lines in the love letter that says that that God says I don't hate you on the day that it's cloudy and love you on the day that is pretty time but you gotta believe that well God don't like me now listen I've done told you before God can't change his mind if he ever loved you and gave you the new birth he can't go backwards praise God listen we can for we can either forget or decide to go in a different direction God can't do either one now he can forget your sins but he can't forget you that's right everybody with me so watch the fourth part of this whole thing that's the word of God that's the thing that drives it sure justification is part of the word sanctification you have to hear the word the baptism Holy Ghost is the word of God but it's in a stage remember we're talking about the the ankles to the water and the water up to the knees and water up to the loins which is life but then he took him right back on the on the bank again and trees started growing life came that's what brother Brown always says he's talking about justification baptism Holy Ghost typing your new birth but then he brings number four in and he says the word in other words what is the word the words what you grow thereby you know what the word in what the Bible says that you may grow thereby so what are we talking about today growth yes yes now talk about being born again we're talking about growth if you're not born again we're talking to you but if you're not born if you're born again bro right grow up in God what is it remember oh back to the confession remember and it's a great point that God can never he can never anoint or take a negative confession from you let me tell you something he don't know what to do with it there's nowhere in the Bible for it there's nowhere in the plan for a negative confession it's like what are you talking about what are you talking about no he's talking about me and you growing up listen the Bible tells us to come boldly before the throne of grace now does it tell you to stay there no you gotta come out amen and do what live what was in there what was the problem with the high priest he couldn't live it because it wasn't in him it was temporary he could go get an anointing he'd come back anointing off of Moses could he get anointed speak just as God had to put a veil over his face but when that Veil lifted off he smoked a rock instead of spoke to it he killed an Egyptian right I want to do that one day we'll go through our lineage and show all these people that we are that we preach about all the time and we we Revere these people but Noah was drunk Abraham laughed at God couldn't believe it 75 you had to wait a little 99 Moses was a murderer David murder and adulterer Ruth came from an incestuous city right where incest started the moabites Rahab was a harlot but that's what that's who God's Own don't work on the others he works on me and you know the ones that came through the fire and through the flood and through all the different things because we have a testimony when we have a testimony service in heaven that's why the angels are going to have to shut up and be quiet they have no testimony they never went through a test but you and I went through tests so we will have a place for our testimony now watch this brother Brown said the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out that's what was happening now we're being honed and trimmed out listen as we were talking about the Masterpiece uh several years ago uh and brother Brown said the flaw was when Michelangelo Struck it you got to remember though that when Michelangelo Angelo begin that process of carving or everywhere you want to call it making the sculpture that sculpture was already in there right it was already there it was inside that big old block of granite it just took a master builder to catch the mind of God to see what's in there and he just started chipping away well that's what God did with us he'd start chipping away that's why I said it's not it is a crock pot not a microwave all right it's a moving on we've been 60 something years since the prophet's been here the word of God started in 1947 for us to be able to listen to if we make it to 2027 how many years is that yeah that's a lot for us to catch what one man said one man but one man said it's a lot for us to catch but we'll do it because God what God promised it it's part of the plan like I said before ever been to this anything according to sin has an expiration date so you don't have to worry about that you don't have to worry about those things it will expire there will be a time where it will be well with your soul all the time and you won't have to worry about your soul will be in so contact with everything else and that's what we're doing now because I believe our soul is eternal by the new birth it is that Creator it is the master of the wind it is those virtues it is those things it is Jesus Christ it's not a second person it is him but we have so encapsulated it with our spirit realm because of our carnal mind and because of how we came up not because of our parents but how we came up right how we came up and we what we were fed and got fed and fed on ourselves it's it's like brother Robert says about Adam Adam was this great controller he had control over everything right move stuff make a mountain range go over this way just by his voice Brothers after the false it is his his brain or his or his his mind got cloudy and that's our problem my mind gets cloudy it clouds up with all these things of the world that's why I said if we could just forget from this day back it would unCloud a lot and guess what that's what's going to happen when we come to a body change it's not going to just be that your body's changed it's not going to be that your joints won't hurt and you're not stooped over your mind is going to be renewed your mind is going to be changed the former things will pass away behold all things will become new so look brother promise this is a promise to us the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can what fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again it is today the house of God will live again it is today the tree of life is growing again you and I are that tree of life on the Earth today all right brother Robin Christianity versus idolatry he said we are made partakers of his Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God Amen then death to self raised with him now listen his word made flesh again in us oh brother Neville look what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God who is the Living God the word but not just the word this right here is dead the letter Kelly but that attached to this makes life the word in you makes itself real glory to God oh I know you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am but oh brother did you see it triumph over every denomination all paganism he ain't talking about out there somebody in US amen amen a living God made manifest in a living Temple and the word of God which is God is made flesh in you you're seated in Heavenly places triumph over all things in Christ Jesus we need to uh we need to go back and read um talk about brother Bob who's talking about um spoken words reading the seed overcome because Overcomers don't think it's going to win in this time [Music] because remember you get all this up here in the Book of Revelations you know it comes to this come but right at the very end he said he didn't overcome it this is what I'll give you he's an overcoming this is what I'll give you all right so to me that's a direct mandate that if you overcome this is what God's got to give you he has to give that to you because he can't go against his word all right because that's what we're talking about now the the nature of God and then the Sixth Seal is open and me and you down here on the earth and we'll get into that a little bit later I want to kind of break this just a real quick overview of that maybe if we do it today they owned a oh uncover and open it well that he's talking about two prophets but you and I are prophetic people you and I are going to have to master our nature amen amen you and I are going to have to as the two prophets stand in master Nature by the same Holy Ghost you got inside of you today we've got to master this guy first then we will Master the wind then we've already seen that the third polls happen in this church several several times through many people things have been called and come back storms have been spoken out of this as gas has been put in the gas tank pocketbook that nobody knows where in the world that came back Keys have come back well you so that ain't nothing yeah well yeah it is well that's God the devil's not going to do that he's going he's the one that made you lose them he's the one that made you not look at the gas tank until it got empty but what's calling us folks deep yes what's in here it's what's calling and if you call for Lord I want to be I want to be that I want to be virtue I want to be knowledge I want to be Temperance then if there's a d if there is a deep now if you just go through life numbers I'll get out then you're not going to get anything you got to have a deed that calls brother Brown had a deed that called to him to do things that no normal people would do because what happened with that deep call when he had a prayer line brother Brown didn't know these people that's right that's right he didn't know what was going on but the Holy Ghost Inside of him did it so that Holy Ghost took over and that deep comes out and that deep said you're so-and-so from a so-and-so town you come from a place that that you know it's got a lot of rocks and then you were seeing a doctor that had glasses on and a blue shirt boy I mean that was a vivid if it was an imagination it was a good one but it wasn't an imagination it was the mind of God from that deep call where brother Brown says I just get out of the way and let him take over that's what I hope that we do is we stand here as we sing songs that we just get out of the way and let God Speak before there can be a deep call though there has to be a deep response so in other words God saw what we'd want so he put it already here he's not developing that plan he's got to play already right here waiting on us he's got it in the word of God it's already waiting on us when we come through our journey till we come to the place to where uh it's like brother Joe we were talking about just a little bit ago about Revelation and I remember there's no more prevailing power but a revelation so brother Joe he's they're they're talking about you know the different levels of their archery and it became revealed to him that there was a a different way or another way to get to some of the things they're getting to he said it was a revelation well it's been there the whole time then people just didn't start shooting in in triple SA or USA and then NSA over here it just developed no they've been there the whole time the Revelation or the or the the quickening is just what comes to me and you it the quickening is just what comes to me and you it quickens and we say oh that's what it is see that's the plan of God because sometimes we do get a little cloudy we do get a little foggy in our Revelation but when that collab breaks back and we see what God's already saying how many times have you read the Bible there's a day you look and say did they had that they get a different book message you sit there read a message and you read it and you and somebody comes back and quotes out of it and you said man that pace must have been stuck together I don't believe him no you read it it's just that your mind was foggy at the time to what you needed because we'll read here in just a minute where brother Brown talks about people going out past Revelation or going out past the plan of God and he calls them scrap heaps right we'll read it maybe in just a little bit but there was something in the call out for more of a good we're in now but can you remember when you first started justification sanctification started coming to church got cleaned up uh you had a desire what was that that was the Deep call that the Deep was coming out whatever was in there see that old unclean spirit that was inside there was pulling in this direction but when the unclean Spirit went out remember brother Brown said you got a new heart you got a new spirit but not his spirit yet but you got a new purpose in life that new purpose is that call and then when they give you the holy ghost that was the truth that's why that me me and people say well I I know I got the Holy Ghost I went to church or I know I got the Holy Ghost because I believe brother Brown was a prophet that don't mean nothing that's right nothing but when that thing down inside of you speaks out and when that thing inside of you says that ain't nothing but the truth and that thing inside of you wants to come to church more than wants to sit at home that's the deed that calls to the deep I want more Revelation I want to read more I want to study more I want to listen I want to learn how to praise God and not the devil I want to learn how to praise here and not the world I mean come on you see these people go to these cells used to what Black Friday they might kill each other to get in the door to save fifteen dollars yeah everybody knows they've been I went one time and I did get a revelation we were in Augusta Well Jim's mom and I don't think Gene went bless his heart he had a lot of he had a lot of Revelation but I decided to go with him one day we got caught in Best Buy or somewhere and I mean these people I wish y'all would act that way sometime over a 25 radio they saved 15 bucks so they're piling them and they're get away from it you know picking people out of the way buggies you know they're bumping buggies they're bumping them they were happy they were gonna save some money why am I saving your life amen that's what this is it's going to save your life it'll be a Black Friday if you don't get born again and a Saturday and a Sunday I don't mind the attitude's getting away at the end of Thursday and Friday I don't know where that came from but that was on sale so I give it to you but you see how people act and then we we then we then we come to church and we go listen I know emotion has nothing to do with it but listen if you're alive and something inside of you is bubbling out there's got to be a time when you can just say oh praise the Lord give him the praise now the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because what you were hungering for it you would never hunger to call for th there now see that's where I believe that seed is or not inside of you it's a representation that he knew you would one day say hey I'm done I'm done I'm tired of running I'm tired of uh stumbling over my own self tired of my life going backwards I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired see listen people in the people in the world they're the same way they're just striving brother Brown talks about this hungry he talks about deep calls to the Deep he talks about the boy that that eats um pedals off the bicycle why he's looking for sulfur same over me and you when we get hungry what do we do we desire food obviously right but where's that come from your body is saying I'm hungry I need to eat your body is saying hey somebody I hadn't seen in 20 years is coming to visit wow oh I'm so glad they're coming I'm so glad that this is happening well guess what be so glad that you get to see God on Saturday and Sunday and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday but there's one thing for sure he promised he'd be right here if we'd be here and even if you're not here he's here anyway amen I like what one a preacher said one time he said there's going to be a lot of people miss it because they weren't at church for their visitation I'll make it quiet praise the Lord anyhow but then but the plan of God is he's moving on whether you you're going to decide whether to stay here you're going to decide I wouldn't move on so you just might miss your day of visitation there's nothing such providing powers or revelation of the word of God let's continue on let's hear it too I'm sorry I'm not going to get to my point brother Brown talks about um um he makes a quote about the spirit of wisdom but here in Ephesians it talks about giving you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him that's what we want that the eyes of our understanding being enlightened not these eyes the eyes of our understanding being enlightened in other words revelated that you may know what is the hope of his calling in other words what what his plan is because it says The Inheritance what is the inheritance of people it's the word of God because his will is his word regardless evil age brother Brian said why would call what would call God call a people out of his evil age for for his name this is the worst day most uh intolerable I'll read it maybe read it this afternoon talk about being incontinent talking about being uh accusers and abusers and and feminine and all these different things why'd he put us here why'd he put us in this age to overcome that and there's going to be a people that will overcome that and the reason is is to try her his bride he's not trying the world out there because remember if you're tried and grown from it you're a child if you are put in a trial and you don't you're a bastard and God don't ever have bastard children right sorry but that's the way the Bible says the reason of it is is to try her his bride when she is made manifest been tried been proven proved to who not to your neighbor poo to Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end you talk about the seed into the ground it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4 that's where we're at and restores back again the original faith that was once given we've already covered that we find out this evil age is to prove to Satan prove to Satan amen that she's not like that Eve that come in the first that she is not that type of a woman she will be Tried by his word the bride as Adam bride Adam's bride was Tried by the word now remember Adam's bride did what fell this bride will not fall don't ever come and tell me that it looks bleak and and and dark for the bride no listen I was thinking about this morning you take the chosen of God which is Israel right if we don't get anything else we'll get to this the children the chosen people of God they're my kids they're the Jews takes him out of Egypt two million strong but remember part of them were a mixed multitude so if you were to stand on a on a Mountaintop and look down across that mixed multitude you would see the Jews doing what God Said but you'd also mixed among all that you'd see the Heathen working on sun Saturday yeah right worshiping their idols eating their food same way here not all Israel is Israel that Paul said because Paul could see the same thing by Revelation that it was the mixed multitude that gave Moses the most troubled but remember the reason I was thinking about this I thought man you know God told him not to do anything on Saturday nothing on the Sabbath day right remember the guy that was picking up sticks they caught him and they killed him why was he doing that he knew better you know why he saw his neighbor do it who wasn't a Jew he saw his neighbor do come on somebody he saw his neighbor do it he wasn't a Christian so they thought it was okay for him to do it that's why I've been in the message of the hour we're getting too close to the the world and not farther away fence dwellers fence dwellers would get you killed but I am the chosen of God I will do what God Said I will honor the Sabbath day we know that with all the all the Ten Commandments but if you'll look but you feel that was a bystander looking from here on on the hill you're like why are these people do well it's the same way don't say there's listen the bride has never been in bad shape never I don't care if the Dark Ages when they killed you just for saying that you love the Lord then he give us the Seven Seals and just for a minute he gave us the Seven Seals as a promise that they would be sealed up until the end time told Daniel seal this up until the time of the end and they've been sealed up we know you know why we know they sealed up they were sealed up because they've been open because they've been open the prophet of God took those sales and and God through him opened those seals up that we could see there was not some mystery so much as the world would see the four horse riders and all these different things but it was a Plan of Redemption justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost and the word of God the force seal being the word of God made manifest in a group of people to take a Rapture because a Rapture happens on the fourth seal all right now don't let it confuse you but that's what the prophet said if you'll just use a little intelligence a little bit of of not worldly knowledge but a little bit of Godly knowledge you'll see that the four horseriders and the four beasts they're no more on the fifth seal six cylinder seventh seal so brother Ram said therefore the bride must be gone so the bride take a Rapture in the for sale but the seventh seal is our rapture so don't get confused because remember you're going through the outer Court the inner Court the holy of holies and just like the the when we were receiving then reading in Ezekiel God brings you right back out in that court again and then you got living at a higher level you got to live it at a higher level see if you take the if you take the first seal as being type in Redemption they're all part of redemption but type it as justification knowing that there's one true and living God if that one true and God has done away with your sins all right well now that should be as we were talking today because everybody would be so happy that all of our sins you know we wouldn't no more be found we couldn't remember them no more well I'm just glad he don't remember I'm not worried about if you do that's what they call Grace for him but God didn't just give us Grace he gave us Grace for the moment he gave us so much grace it just eradicated all the back hey if he remembers one time then you've not took all that to God you're still holding on to it if you hadn't just took it to the Lord and said here I I don't want this no more he takes it to the father and says hey they're doing they're confessing positive confession not a negative confession positive confession so then we see this that seal number one seal number two is what sanctification which is this guy it's it's cleaning up that middle guy that's that Spirit realm is taking the unclean Spirit out brother Brown talks about putting a new spirit in and putting giving you a new heart but not his heart yet or it's spirit yet right so what's the third and that horseradish red is blood red is always simple sanctification yes always the blood of Jesus Christ is what sanctifies US Keeps Us Sanctified all right then the baptism of my Holy Ghost there's a black horse you get a boy you say well how in the world does that happen well you guys become dead before the Holy Ghost can come inside of you you've got to get rid of that darkness and that Blackness and get rid of it to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we go to number four which is which is a Pale Horse which is White red and black pour them in a paint can try it sometime do it naturally pour them in a paint can and stir them up the most putrid color you've ever seen in your life pale that's what the Pale Horse is he's all then wound up together well what is the foresee them it's all of you wound up together in the word of God that when you get all wound up in the word of God you're going to Rapture yeah it got finished with us at that time you say what about the fifth cell six cell seven seal yeah that's the Israel but see that's where we bring it back that's when we bring it back to here this right here is now our second stage of justification and sanctification thereby with me all right we've already got the new birth down here because this afternoon we're going to read the quote and blaspheme its name for brother Brown said you've come all this way and you don't have the Holy Ghost yet and he only had us right here it stumbles a lot of people but it should never stumble us because you must be born again first he didn't say it would come all this way and you ain't got the new birth yet he said you don't have the Holy Ghost yet all right that's an anointing not to birth but now down here it is both about with me when you get born again you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he wants to put you in service now yes yeah when he puts you in service what do you do not even in service and service is going up that statue of perfect man being drawn up being pressured up he's pulling us up so the fifth seal what we were talking about the fifth seal the other day uh well in conversation with somebody the fifth seal is the Jews yes it is to the Jews but thank God for a prophet that told us that those people didn't want to be saved did you um so see that's a higher form of justification the real you didn't do it God didn't hold it against those Jews even though they said let his blood be on us and our children deny Jesus was a messiah denied that God had come in human flesh they're looking for him yes but he gave white roads brother collie he gave white robes to those people because he was the justifier he said I'm going to do this for them just like me and you he said I'm going to for them they can't justify themselves so I'm going to justify a group of people that don't even want me praise God what about grace and mercy so that comes to me and you as we go to the Capstone to where God will be able to use us again like he wanted to back when when Adam was standing on Earth he wanted to use Adam to rule the world and to have his kids and his kids only listen he was going to have kids whether you think it was one way or the other all right he wasn't going to be by sex because sex is what killed us all right so the spoken word of God was already put there in Genesis 1 26 he said let us make man and let him multiply wasn't even human flesh see we can't find them that see we as humans have to have human flesh to multiply ourselves but spiritual multiplication started on the day of Pentecost under that Pentecost 120 little jesuses were born then three thousand little jesuses were born now there's Millions upon millions of little Jesus is running around here brother Dale brother Mo started with 10 or 12 people foreign there's been a spiritual multiplication going on turn out look at your neighbor because that's what happened my spiritual multiplication he's brought a group of people together brothers and sisters Sons and Daughters of God Amen amen the bride all these things see he has many titles but so do we but we're only one person one person so the six seat watch The Sixth Seal I just read what it was it was total Destruction of nature it was where that the whole nature of this Earth is going to be pulled apart by two prophets by the word of God listen the same word you're hearing today not verbatim but the same word the same message is going to come right off of this Gentile group and go right over there on those two prophets and they're going to preach and they're going to say hey look back there he's not coming for you like you think he is he's already come remember what Zechariah somewhere they they say where'd you get those scars he's in the house with my friends Well that took them way back to to 2000 years ago when they hung him on the cross then they started like oh my word where you know in other words we have no like me and you when me and you when we first come to God did the devil go well that's okay I don't mind losing you yeah go ahead yeah Lord can have you no he took his grubby fingers and he went I got some me and sister Regina's only two in the house maybe sister Rebecca is number three I'm waiting but he stuck his grumpy fingers and he wanted to keep you it won't let you go he want to keep you but by the power of the word of God I'm done I don't want no more of this I want this garbage I want my nature to be changed if I can ever get my nature changed brother Brandon just a little small illustrations that he used to say he said if I had in my soul today if I could take John Dillinger which was a for those of you kids that don't know it Google it he was a master criminal he was a murderer I mean he was like enemies uh Public Enemy Number One they were looking for John Dillinger and you know what got him a movie right he went in the movie theater and somebody ratted on him and when he came out they took him out they wasn't even no question they wouldn't even know I'm gonna read you your rights the rights that he got come out of the end of a barrel that's how that's how awful he was but brother Brown makes an illustration he said now if the spirit of John Dillinger would would come off of him and come into me he said I'd be a gangster yeah yeah same way with all of us because you know what the spirit you were born with that old Dynamic nature was anointed by Satan and that's who you acted like so now we want that nature as we said before you know we want it but you know what God said I'll take it away from you don't worry if you'll do what I say get in the plan confess your sins I take that stuff away from you but to what the sex seal is going to do is it's gonna get you in changing the changing of the body Department that's why we're heading toward we're not just going to jump from wrong one all the way up to wrong ten 12 14 never have many seven eight no the plan is that we grow the plan is that brother Brown said if you don't get the foundation right he said you'll climb up that ladder and say to all you all of a sudden you'll fall off Jesus told us he said what a man that would build on a sandbar and a storm come I just blew him right away he said if you build your house on a rock a revelation you built your house on that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail they're coming and they're here but they're not going to Prevail against me and you praise God so what is a seventh seal that's Christ on the earth in a bride yes yes The Headstone not coming here not the Cornerstone part of it but the headstone so that's what we're heading toward s so the seals fit right in with everything to me the seals just ties everything together brother Brian said tied the whole Bible together now you've got to be able to understand that it tied the entire Bible together but if you'll see that it's a Plan of Redemption what is it what's the Bible that's right the Bibles The Plan of Redemption from the beginning to the end right that's the plan we just got to attach ourselves to that so that we go we've been through virtue and knowledge and Temperance so I want to stop right here just demand temperatures for a few minutes besides just giving all deals out to your faith virtually the Virgin knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness that word temperance is self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetite mastering controlling curbing restraining controlling oneself temperate continent I'll read scripture a few minutes worth in the end time we become an incontinent people now for those of us get older we know what incontinence is but those who don't know what it is is you can't hold yourself okay ten percent means stop drinking alcohol either no 10 doesn't mean alcohol cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Ghost Temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh he's talking about the drinking but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not to be a titler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cost to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we he said we see when we wonder why God is not in his church I ask you the same thing then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things it used to do yes sir why because we got our flu stopped up brother Brown drip perfect man says I had Temperance oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when Wrath it spoke to you somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers don't jump up and roll up your sleeve and now but talk with Godly love Temperance and kindness is that the way you want to be when you're riled upon round not back let him be your example then you say if thou be the Son of God turn these stones of bread he could have done it and showed he was God but he had Temperance when they called him Bells above he said I'll forgive you for that they pulled hands full of beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he was having a pretty bad day he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily he had seen they had seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with them so forth they put a rag on his head and around his eyes and hit him on the back of the head with a stick said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll believe you he had temperance now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up in SASS and fuss and stew and carry on uh you ain't got no can't add that because it won't add see it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber and vulcanize it to a piece of iron we don't discuss what vulcanization is it just won't work it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is that's why God said I'll give you a heart of Flesh in other words something pliable something he can work with God can't work with a Stony heart when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of look Holy Ghost temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it let's continue reading talk about vulcanization again when you get the right counter Temperance like he had it'll vulcanized if you've got just a man-made halfway South stuck believe for temperance oh I'd have slapped him but I might give a name in the paper that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanized you can add that to your faith now we talked about the impact of vulcanization I think we know what it is I just really appreciate that they put this part in here that after rubber is vulcanized it cannot be reversed after God has burnt all you out and put the new you in brother John can't be reversed can't be there's no going backwards in God now there's going backwards in you but not going backwards in God that's where you just right here and then we'll then we'll close second Timothy three this know also in the last days how many believe we in the last day amen all right perilous time shall come men shall be lovers on their own self boy selfies Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and holy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those who are good traitors heady high-minded lover to lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God look having a form of this right here amen having a form of godliness send a message church until you make them mad having a form of godliness but denying the power of thereof look from such turn away brother Brown talks in 1951 testimony look now while we're here together all of us longing for the same thing he's praying make us true stewards may we shape Our Lives by self-control that's what Temperance is that we will know by the help of the Holy Spirit to have a full confidence that Jesus will say Well done my good and faithful servant at that day and I told you the other day about I want God to be proud of us listen to what brother Brown says let's stand and musicians come in blasphemius name says to my knowledge I had Temperance self-control I like that My Country Tis of Thee Crown my soul with self-control from sea to shine and sea patience oh my tested don't you worry Satan will count them for you I'm climbing up the ladder now I've added virtue knowledge Temperance now I've got to add patience that's what we're going to get to this afternoon right here's what he said I still ain't got the Holy Ghost that's a direct quote now he didn't say I don't have the new birth he said I don't have the Holy Ghost In other words he don't have the Holy Ghost right there to do this one thing right here let's read this real quick Ephesians 4 verse 15 the Bible hasn't answered everything speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body all right now that's us Finley joined together and compacted that's what the Holy Ghost does it fills in the cracks and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part makeeth the increase of the body until the edifying of itself in love that word compacted means knit together I looked up this big word it says to cause to colise that means come together to form one Mass one Mass you are today one body as a human it is one Mass it is totally connected I hope together well that's the way the body of Christ is supposed to be not an arm missing not a leg missing come together to form one Mass to join together put together unite or knit together what infection to put together in one's mind to compare to gather conclude and consider to cause a person to unite with one in a conclusion or come to the same opinion to prove demonstrate to teach and to instruct the Bible tells us that we would be as I said before incontinent this I said now having Temperance makes you continent you have self-control you're able to control your desires you're able to control all these other things all these peripheral things that um that bother us I know y'all don't get bothered by stuff but I do so praise the Lord just pray for us no we bothered all of us are bothered by stuff yeah just like I said before why worry about something you can't do anything about oh y'all don't do that anyway okay that's fine let's sing a song There are they're already filled with the Holy Ghost ready to go in the Rapture so let's make a sound like um I'll Fly Away of a new creation ain't got good I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man all things are passed away I've been born again [Applause] [Music] that's what I am [Music] [Applause] we are friends please [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] together we are good together [Music] Nation I'll bring you bring you if you're not a thing please [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm a brand new man [Music] [Applause] [Music] a new creation [Music] we are [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he gave us a spiritual life ninny came in and gave us a new birth birthed us into the family of God and you know what an heir does an heir gets everything that the father has to offer everything that makes you an heir of God and Joint heirs with Christ we got to believe that that we're not going to get something we already got it things already written down here all we got to do is what plug ourselves into it I like what brother Ernie says plug yourself into the eternal that's why I lie you plug yourself and you got to do it he's not gonna pull and grab your cord and plug it you got to pull it yourself plug it in say I want to be a part of that I want that energy you know that's what's so great you look at a house I was thinking about this the other day you take a house and you've got a line coming in from the power company it's just one big line right it goes into the back of that panel right there bro John it comes in at whatever it is 400 watts I mean if you just if you touched it you're dead all right and then if you took something and plugged it into it it just blew it to pieces right but there's still power it's the same power that goes through that light right there but it has what been divided on the day of Pentecost that power divided and it was where the people could then stand it they brought John you plug stuff into it now and we'll blow you up it'll make you happy it'll give you light it'll give you peace it'll give you Joy so it listen the I was already there just plug into it I'll praise God think about that that power's sitting there just waiting to be used not developing is already in that box just go over there and plug it in let it divide out on the dead Pentecost and all down through the churches has been dividing that power coming from the same line but that same line was hard to take it was so powerful but he came down and came into 120. then 3 000. and then it keeps going and people just what then they can just come bowling and and not worry about what you plug in because it's already been provided for you those
