[6:31] lord
[6:32] if you'd like turn in your scriptures
[6:33] turn to where let's see no we didn't use
[6:36] this this morning but we've got first
[6:37] timothy
[6:39] 6
[6:40] and hebrews 12. first timothy 6
[6:43] hebrews 12. remember the announcements
[6:46] of all of the uh doing richard might
[6:49] order
[6:51] click of some air on over here because
[6:54] if esther is fanning
[6:58] it's bound to be hot out there his
[7:00] choice every fans will fit the building
[7:02] on fire
[7:05] we'll have a bonfire
[7:08] amen this time of the year it's hard to
[7:11] get everything figured out you know with
[7:12] all of it and two if any of you
[7:15] fooling with the
[7:17] the things you know
[7:18] uh don't fool with them without heating
[7:21] air because
[7:22] we try to get it set
[7:24] and then you go food with it because
[7:26] all this whole week
[7:28] the fans were running constant all the
[7:31] whole week because somebody had clicked
[7:32] the fans on
[7:34] so don't don't fool with it you know
[7:37] just uh leave it alone we'll get richard
[7:39] and aaron and them to
[7:41] to do it and take care of it but
[7:43] you know you come in and you find out
[7:45] everything's been changed and you don't
[7:47] know how to change it back
[7:48] so that makes a a bad doing amen but
[7:51] remember now all of those that are away
[7:53] today we i was thinking well ago we got
[7:56] five ministers and three deacons and
[7:58] there's not a one here
[8:00] just
[8:01] this afternoon
[8:03] we're doing pretty good we're back like
[8:05] the old days you know
[8:07] but they're out visiting already taking
[8:09] care of grandbabies and things that has
[8:11] to be done
[8:12] but
[8:13] remember them remember wade in june and
[8:15] bob and
[8:16] monica and them be traveling back and
[8:18] i'm sure those from south carolina
[8:20] brother i think brother aaron and ends
[8:22] up in the carolinas and brother luis was
[8:24] it brother burley's and i think they
[8:28] said brother dean was down at his
[8:29] brothers
[8:30] so then you got all of them
[8:32] scattered out and that's good
[8:35] so remember them on their way back home
[8:36] okay
[8:37] so first timothy
[8:40] i've made all the announcements this
[8:42] morning of all the ministering brethren
[8:44] that are coming in and so remember these
[8:47] and be much in prayer for each one
[8:50] lord jesus we thank you
[8:52] for the day and the time that we're
[8:54] living we thank you for calvary
[8:56] and we just ask you lord to reveal
[8:58] yourself unto us and make known unto us
[9:02] the ways that we
[9:04] need to walk therein because
[9:07] we know that there is a word for every
[9:09] day and every hour that we're living on
[9:11] the earth so help us to find the day
[9:14] that we are to be here
[9:16] to not just be haphazardly waiting for
[9:18] something to take place
[9:20] but to be lord word that you could
[9:24] manifest yourself
[9:26] and father we believe you will because
[9:28] you promised it
[9:29] you said you'd do it so we believe you
[9:31] we ask you to have your way bless those
[9:32] who will be traveling back home today
[9:35] and all of your take care of your people
[9:37] lord we love you in jesus name amen
[9:41] all right
[9:42] first timothy
[9:49] six
[9:53] all right
[9:55] you well you got it up there i'll read
[9:56] verse 14 that thou may keep this
[9:59] commandment without spot
[10:02] unrebukable until the appearing of our
[10:05] lord jesus christ now we know that is in
[10:07] this day right
[10:08] we're in the part of his appearing
[10:11] watch
[10:12] which in his times
[10:15] he shall show who is the blessed and
[10:17] only potentate
[10:18] the king of kings and lord of lords
[10:21] who only hath immortality dwelling in
[10:24] the light
[10:25] which no man can approach unto
[10:28] whom no man hath seen
[10:30] nor can see to whom be honor and power
[10:33] everlasting now see that goes all the
[10:36] way into
[10:38] the fact of the eternal god
[10:41] that you know cannot be seen or
[10:43] understood
[10:44] all the way but it has to be in jesus
[10:46] christ or we'll never see nothing all
[10:48] right now we go to hebrews 12
[10:52] and uh verse 18
[10:55] for you're not come unto the mount that
[10:57] might be touched
[10:58] that burn with fire nor into blackness
[11:01] and darkness and tempest
[11:03] into the sound of a trumpet talking back
[11:05] back in the days of moses right and the
[11:07] voice of words which voice
[11:09] they that heard entreated that the word
[11:11] should not be spoken unto them anymore
[11:14] for they could not endure that which was
[11:16] commanded and so
[11:18] and if so much as a beast touched the
[11:20] mountain it shall be stoned or stressed
[11:22] through the dark
[11:24] and so terrible was the sight
[11:27] that moses said i exceedingly fear and
[11:30] quake
[11:31] but now where we come to the jumping
[11:34] from verse 18
[11:36] we're not come to that back there
[11:39] so here's where we've come to but you're
[11:42] coming to mount zion
[11:44] and unto the city of the living god
[11:47] the heavenly jerusalem
[11:49] now remember this city of the living god
[11:52] heavenly jerusalem
[11:54] all right
[11:56] and to an innumerable company of angels
[12:00] to the general assembly that's where you
[12:02] and i are at right now see
[12:05] compassed about with all of these
[12:08] things watch now to the general assembly
[12:11] and church of the firstborn which are
[12:14] written in heaven and who god the judge
[12:16] of all
[12:17] and to the spirits of just men made
[12:19] perfect
[12:20] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[12:21] covenant
[12:23] into the blood of sprinkling that
[12:25] speaketh better things than that of abel
[12:27] but now remember
[12:30] as we're saying there in verse 22
[12:33] remember the city of the living god
[12:38] the heavenly
[12:39] jerusalem
[12:41] all right and then we'll get to that
[12:43] point you may be seated
[12:45] we'll try to get to that point if we can
[12:48] but
[12:51] i want to just
[12:52] not review but just a higher of what
[12:55] we were covering this morning
[12:57] and then move on into the point i want
[12:59] to get to
[13:01] if you have any questions on this let me
[13:03] know we'll try to cover them wednesday
[13:06] and uh you know
[13:08] but
[13:09] i hope you were following me at least
[13:11] listening
[13:13] this morning because
[13:16] i was telling you the things that i know
[13:19] i know paradise was taken up
[13:22] all right
[13:23] there's a lot i don't understand about
[13:25] some of the things there but
[13:27] uh i believe that
[13:29] it was taken up
[13:31] and i believe jesus was the one that
[13:33] took it up
[13:35] all right
[13:36] and i believe that everywhere he went
[13:41] is where
[13:43] that they went
[13:44] all right
[13:46] now but remember he made a thing he made
[13:50] a
[13:51] he went one step above
[13:53] all things
[13:55] because he went to immortality in the
[13:58] flesh
[14:00] he was almighty god which as i said you
[14:02] can cover that from this from uh timothy
[14:06] he was almighty god that light cannot
[14:08] approach unto you know the great eternal
[14:11] but he condescended downward and as he
[14:13] did
[14:14] you start using the word immortal
[14:17] because you would not use that word
[14:18] immortal or immortality
[14:20] uh you would not use that
[14:23] in referring to
[14:25] uh back before the eternal
[14:28] because you're
[14:29] you know
[14:30] you're getting into a different point
[14:32] immortality is
[14:34] mortal made
[14:36] eternal right all right so then
[14:39] when he came up
[14:42] he went into immortality
[14:45] body spirit soul everything because we
[14:47] know he was almighty god anyway but i'm
[14:49] just making the point that he went up
[14:52] and when he did
[14:53] he then
[14:54] uh he reached that immortality
[14:58] all right
[14:59] and he took the saints with him
[15:02] but did he take him to immortality
[15:05] or where did he take them because then
[15:07] paul would not be saying that
[15:10] you know life and immortality is brought
[15:12] to light
[15:13] through the gospel
[15:14] it would say that immortality was
[15:17] finished it was done always over with
[15:19] there
[15:20] but we know it was not all over with
[15:23] there
[15:24] because we'll get to it in a little bit
[15:26] that we're still dying
[15:28] all right so then there's something
[15:30] wrong
[15:32] in this situation
[15:33] all right and we know then that
[15:38] as he reached that point
[15:43] then he would be able to
[15:46] come back
[15:47] in the form of the baptism of the holy
[15:49] ghost on the day of pentecost
[15:51] and would start the way to make it that
[15:55] life and immortality could come to light
[15:58] now it could only be done through him
[16:00] and what he was doing and that's i just
[16:03] want to hit that from this morning
[16:05] to
[16:06] make you think about it
[16:09] and the question i asked this morning
[16:13] and to me is very clear i think
[16:16] that
[16:17] if we see where jesus went
[16:20] then we know where the the
[16:22] people went you know
[16:24] all right and that way then we can look
[16:26] at it and see
[16:28] uh you know and find ourselves
[16:31] all right
[16:32] then let's just read some quotes about
[16:34] the prophet as to where these old
[16:37] testament saints went
[16:40] right
[16:41] and then you i believe will tie together
[16:44] as to what we were covering
[16:46] this morning of
[16:48] the position i believe they went to
[16:50] would be revelations 4
[16:54] and 5.
[16:56] all right because that would be covering
[16:57] the 12 apostles
[17:00] and the 12 patriarchs
[17:03] all right
[17:04] and that would bring it to a position
[17:06] that you could could cover all the
[17:09] redemptive plan
[17:11] bringing it right down to one because
[17:15] jesus christ was that one
[17:18] that is the importance of what we're
[17:20] talking about
[17:21] all right
[17:22] so if you have any questions
[17:25] ask me i'll try my best to answer or
[17:27] either tell you i don't know
[17:29] and you know
[17:31] but we do believe
[17:33] in these things as to
[17:36] maybe we don't understand the uh
[17:38] or i don't
[17:39] don't understand the the way that
[17:42] brother branham would talk of
[17:44] the old testament signs raising and
[17:46] seemingly going into immortality and
[17:48] then turn around and say that they're
[17:50] not
[17:51] and that they're waiting on us
[17:54] all right
[17:54] and uh
[17:56] in doing that then
[17:58] you know let's get those couple out of
[18:00] the way before we go
[18:02] because the brothers i work them to
[18:03] death back there now
[18:05] but
[18:07] brother
[18:09] anderson
[18:11] would you drop over to number 27
[18:15] and let's get this out of the way about
[18:16] the old testament saints depending on us
[18:20] from what the prophet has to say
[18:23] and then we'll drop back to
[18:25] seeing
[18:26] you know what happened in chapter five
[18:29] all right so this is taken from
[18:31] um
[18:34] let me get the glasses
[18:37] melchizedek the great king
[18:40] the great prince and king
[18:43] his prayer is he 69.
[18:46] when we
[18:47] rallied there with abraham isaac and
[18:49] jacob
[18:50] those who were hours of the promise
[18:53] looking forward to us
[18:56] not to fail
[18:59] for without us
[19:01] they cannot be made perfect
[19:05] and how they're depending on us this
[19:07] morning
[19:08] let us not fail
[19:11] all right
[19:13] now see then there's you know if they
[19:15] can get that one in a minute and pull it
[19:17] up going to 28 jehovah jireh
[19:20] paragraph e30
[19:22] he's talking about thinking about our
[19:24] father abraham
[19:26] and him without the holy spirit
[19:29] and we got the baptism of the holy
[19:31] spirit
[19:32] he was under the sacrifice of a lamb
[19:34] which could never take away sin it just
[19:37] covered sin
[19:38] but we're under a sacrifice that put
[19:40] away sin demolished sin divorced sin
[19:43] and then with the faith that we got
[19:48] but yet they were not made perfect
[19:51] without us
[19:52] they're looking for us
[19:54] to move on
[19:56] all right
[19:58] jehovah gyra
[20:00] paragraph 37 which that's uh
[20:03] that one was uh
[20:05] 5
[20:06] 55 this one is 56.
[20:10] he says the old and the old testament
[20:12] provided that
[20:14] how much better does the new covenant a
[20:17] better thing
[20:18] that we without them now listen to him
[20:22] we without them would not be made
[20:24] perfect or them without us
[20:27] rather would not be made perfect
[20:29] god has provided i trust that you will
[20:31] believe it with all your heart as we
[20:33] pray see us all right
[20:36] e9 perfection number 30.
[20:41] he says then we go to 11 chapter 11 and
[20:44] the wonderful shadows of the faith the
[20:46] heroes of faith how that by faith they
[20:49] did such and such the thing
[20:51] and how without us they could not be
[20:53] made perfect
[20:54] because they are the shadow
[20:57] of this
[20:59] to come
[21:02] this is from hebrews
[21:04] chapter 1
[21:06] 1957 paragraph 100.
[21:10] he said i've wondered in the last
[21:11] chapter of the 11th
[21:13] last part of the 11th chapter of hebrews
[21:16] when he talked about abraham in the
[21:18] great faith chapter and at the end he
[21:21] said
[21:22] they wondered about his sheepskin and
[21:23] goatskin and was made destitute and
[21:26] sought as hundred they wandered about no
[21:28] place to go hated and despised and
[21:30] persecuted
[21:31] whom the world isn't
[21:33] isn't worthy of such
[21:35] then paul stands and said
[21:40] but without us they're not perfect
[21:43] they only look to the cross
[21:46] we look through the cross
[21:49] we have the spirit of christ after it
[21:51] become human flesh and dwelt among us
[21:54] so we have that holy spirit all right
[21:57] so then we just get those points out of
[21:59] the way
[21:59] but i want you to think about this
[22:01] afternoon
[22:03] and we'll
[22:04] just start where we mention
[22:07] that when brother branham he went beyond
[22:08] the curtain of time he wanted to see
[22:10] jesus
[22:13] but he said he's not he's higher
[22:16] all right
[22:17] are we back to where we can
[22:19] pick up now we lost some contact
[22:21] somewhere
[22:22] between us and back there
[22:24] all right and that's all right
[22:28] but he says it in the message the
[22:29] rejected king paragraph 150.
[22:32] he said now he said he wanted to see him
[22:35] he said where is jesus i want to see him
[22:37] so bad
[22:38] he said now he's just a little higher
[22:41] right up that way
[22:43] said someday he'll come to you see
[22:45] you were sent for a leader all right he
[22:47] was not allowed to go into the presence
[22:50] of jesus
[22:52] putting jesus into a higher
[22:55] form
[22:56] but what would be that higher form
[23:00] all right
[23:02] so now let's deal with one thing let's
[23:04] take those some quotes as i was saying
[23:06] this morning about what brother branham
[23:09] has said where these people go to
[23:12] and uh
[23:15] you say well you know well okay let's
[23:17] read and see what he says
[23:19] this is talking taken from the mighty
[23:20] conqueror
[23:22] i'll give the numbers in case i don't
[23:24] know what's wrong wrong back there but
[23:26] we'll
[23:27] get it to going
[23:29] okay we got it to going
[23:32] all right
[23:33] because i want you to read
[23:35] i think we read this this morning but i
[23:37] want you to read it the mighty conqueror
[23:39] in the old testament saints being led by
[23:40] the lord jesus
[23:42] the mighty conqueror the old testament
[23:44] saints when they got close to that great
[23:47] celestial city
[23:51] now do you remember what i asked you to
[23:52] remember
[23:57] the city
[23:59] the heavenly jerusalem
[24:02] because the old testament saints is not
[24:04] going to the future home
[24:07] erase that
[24:10] all right you say well how do you know
[24:12] because jesus hadn't prepared it
[24:15] right
[24:16] is not the prophet saying that jesus has
[24:18] gone now to prepare
[24:20] the future home
[24:22] but there's a heavenly jerusalem
[24:25] right
[24:26] all right
[24:28] so got close to that great celestial
[24:30] city
[24:32] not the future home now
[24:34] all right
[24:35] they said lift up the everlasting gates
[24:37] and be lifted up let the kingdom of
[24:39] glory go in
[24:41] who is this king of glory
[24:43] and watch what he comes down to
[24:48] the old testament saints said the lord
[24:49] of hosts mighty in battle and all coming
[24:51] down through the city of jerusalem
[24:53] come jesus in the forefront with all the
[24:56] old testament saints he let captivity
[24:59] captive
[25:01] he'd give gifts to men
[25:04] uh
[25:05] that captivity cavity sent it on high
[25:07] and give gifts to them walked up in the
[25:09] presence of god the father
[25:13] and said
[25:14] here they are father
[25:16] i have overcome
[25:19] and i've brought them here
[25:23] all right
[25:24] are you listening
[25:27] now everywhere he's at is where they're
[25:29] at
[25:30] i have brought them here
[25:34] so now what happened he said climb up on
[25:36] this strong and set down at my right
[25:39] hand till i make every enemy your
[25:42] footstool
[25:43] all right
[25:45] so now where did the saints go with him
[25:49] and he climbs up on the throne and sits
[25:51] down
[25:52] right
[25:53] and what did we cover this morning
[25:55] revelations 4
[25:57] shows the throne
[25:59] then one on the throne
[26:01] revelations 5
[26:03] shows that one on the throne
[26:05] and the lamb that takes the book
[26:08] ties it all together in the plan of
[26:10] redemption
[26:11] climbs up on the throne and sits down
[26:14] and then uh sold in prison he said he
[26:16] climbed up on the throne and sat down
[26:18] and said
[26:19] i'm the one that done it
[26:21] all right
[26:22] so now think about what he's saying
[26:27] climb up on the throne and sit down
[26:29] at my right hand
[26:31] till i make every enemy your footstool
[26:33] all right
[26:34] go ahead with number 13 now they they
[26:36] got back up back there so
[26:39] i laid some notes out i guess i gave
[26:41] them the wrong one
[26:43] but this is from the message of mighty
[26:45] conqueror priest in 58
[26:47] 329
[26:49] i can hear the father
[26:51] say
[26:52] said set on my throne here
[26:54] son
[26:55] until i make the liest enemy thy
[26:58] footstool
[27:01] and jesus climbed up at the right hand
[27:03] of god
[27:05] of heaven
[27:06] on his strong on high
[27:09] there he stands tonight
[27:14] right
[27:16] so where's he at
[27:19] father strong
[27:22] all right climbed up on the throne
[27:24] chapter five
[27:25] all right sits down
[27:28] look what he says in the next one
[27:29] fourteen
[27:31] but i'm gonna i'm leaving something that
[27:33] i want you to think about but always
[27:36] remember
[27:38] he said the last enemy
[27:41] remember he said it in that quote
[27:46] until i make the list enemy
[27:49] that footstool
[27:51] well it's got to be a last enemy
[27:54] what is that life's enemy
[27:59] you mean with all that happened with the
[28:01] lord jesus
[28:03] and all of the doings
[28:04] that they're still the last enemy
[28:08] right that's right
[28:12] so i just want to get these into your
[28:13] mind to where you think about it look
[28:16] what he said as the eagle stir at their
[28:18] nest
[28:20] he's talking about the only thing
[28:22] different he said
[28:23] that the body is sitting at the right
[28:25] hand of god we all believe
[28:28] he's sitting at the right hand of god on
[28:30] god's strong
[28:35] that's not his throne
[28:38] amen
[28:40] now listen to him
[28:42] he's coming back to reign on his throne
[28:45] it's the throne of david see the the
[28:48] throne of jesus christ is in the
[28:49] millennium
[28:51] but he said you know he that overcomes
[28:54] it with me in my throne as i've overcome
[28:56] and sit with the father in his strong
[28:58] the father's throne is the baptism of
[28:59] the holy ghost the spirit god
[29:02] you know
[29:04] the eternal
[29:05] his throne is on earth in the millennial
[29:07] reign
[29:08] which was promised from david
[29:11] right
[29:12] all right so look at what he's saying
[29:14] it's the throne of david he's to take
[29:16] his throne
[29:17] he's sitting on god strong
[29:19] waiting till the last enemy has made his
[29:22] footstool
[29:23] he will return someday bring in the
[29:26] precious souls with him to take on
[29:29] immortality to live in a glorified body
[29:32] live through the millennium
[29:34] then forever with him
[29:36] all right
[29:40] for him will i accept e52
[29:44] he's talking about how that you you know
[29:45] here in hammond indiana he's gone up to
[29:48] the father's strong
[29:49] up in glory and he sits there at the
[29:52] right hand of his father tonight
[29:54] on his father's strong to make
[29:56] intercession
[29:57] now remember
[29:59] who was it stephen looked up saw him
[30:01] sitting at the father's right hand
[30:03] all right but now the right hand is not
[30:05] a great big hand remember
[30:08] right
[30:09] right hand means power or authority
[30:12] all right so when he raised up
[30:16] in the old testament saints we read the
[30:18] first one said and i brought them here
[30:20] all right see then he climbs up on the
[30:23] throne chapter five four and five
[30:26] of revelation
[30:30] sitting there at the right hand
[30:32] the corporal body is still there
[30:35] because he left the corporal body and
[30:36] came back to earth to make the father
[30:39] strong
[30:40] manifest in earth
[30:42] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[30:44] and you and i all right
[30:46] down through seven church ages we can
[30:48] give you all these quotes that he's
[30:51] that seven church ages that was the
[30:53] father strong amen
[30:55] right
[30:56] see then he's got to go come on in from
[30:58] the father's strong
[31:00] in the seventh church age
[31:02] and getting closer to
[31:05] you know because it don't mean anything
[31:06] probably to you about it but
[31:08] it really means a lot to me
[31:10] that it took many many times of
[31:12] listening to
[31:14] to one message
[31:16] the unveiling of god until i really
[31:18] caught what he was saying
[31:20] because remember he comes in three sons
[31:21] name
[31:23] son of man son of god son of david
[31:27] but on that message brother branham puts
[31:29] it son of god
[31:30] excuse the son of man flesh to die
[31:33] son of god down through seven church
[31:35] ages he said and he comes back in the
[31:38] end time as son of man
[31:41] he said then he'll go to the son of
[31:43] david in the millennium
[31:45] all right so as i said this morning
[31:47] what you're seeing in chapter 5
[31:51] is you're seeing the baptism of the holy
[31:53] ghost it's in our hearts and lives
[31:56] all right
[31:57] but then the lamb comes forth to take
[32:00] the book
[32:02] it's not a lamb it's a man
[32:06] that would be worthy to take the book
[32:08] and that is the son of man now not
[32:10] brother branham
[32:12] and it's not just you and i
[32:15] even though we believe that the bride
[32:17] will be the son of man
[32:18] it means that jesus christ in the bride
[32:22] all right
[32:23] see then you can go to the millennium
[32:27] because he'll be here son of man in the
[32:29] end time all right listen to what he's
[32:31] getting to now
[32:33] and watch all of the points always going
[32:35] down to make your enemy
[32:38] uh this is questions and answers
[32:41] law having a shadow
[32:43] e64
[32:45] he will come
[32:47] he isn't what
[32:50] he isn't up on his strong now
[32:53] he's sitting on god's throne
[32:56] he that overcometh shall sit with me on
[32:58] my throne as i have overcome and i'm set
[33:01] down on set on my father's trump
[33:03] now he's wanting to come back
[33:06] where is his earthly throne the throne
[33:08] of david god said he gave him the throne
[33:11] of david in the millennium all right
[33:14] he'll sit on david strong and we'll see
[33:16] him the great king of kings sitting
[33:18] there there he is now he's sitting on
[33:21] the father strong in other words he's
[33:23] sitting in god's power
[33:25] in spirit now but when he comes back
[33:28] he'll sit on an earthly set in an
[33:30] earthly body hallelujah
[33:33] on david's throne
[33:35] he's on his father's throne now right
[33:37] hand of majesty
[33:40] all right
[33:42] sitting at the right hand
[33:45] raised up to that place
[33:47] with ours where he's the same old
[33:48] testament saints went
[33:52] they went with him to the father strong
[33:54] but yet where did they wind up chapter 5
[33:56] tells you
[33:57] there's 24 elders
[34:01] the 12 apostles
[34:04] all right
[34:05] and the 12 patriarchs
[34:07] you say well the 12 apostles never went
[34:08] up back there
[34:12] when they died they did
[34:15] where did you where did the 12 apostles
[34:19] where do all born-again believers go
[34:24] born-again believers christians
[34:26] where do they go
[34:29] chapter five shows you exactly where
[34:30] they go
[34:34] see because we received the father's
[34:36] strong spirit here
[34:38] right
[34:39] the new birth
[34:42] so then the twelve apostles
[34:45] had the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:48] they were able to go
[34:50] up
[34:52] into a sixth dimension
[34:56] right
[34:58] you know what brother brown calls it
[34:59] paradise
[35:02] he calls the sixth dimension
[35:05] where the the
[35:06] where he saw beyond the curtain of time
[35:08] he'll call that paradise
[35:10] because it's just paradise it's
[35:12] it's a word it means a great wonderful
[35:14] place
[35:16] all right
[35:18] but look what he's saying now
[35:21] look where he comes into number 17 the
[35:24] working of the holy spirit
[35:26] and tonight christ is not sitting on his
[35:28] own throne
[35:29] he's setting on who's strong
[35:31] his father's strong
[35:33] he that overcometh shall sit with me in
[35:36] my throne as i have overcome in setting
[35:38] my father's trump all right
[35:41] now
[35:43] so in revelations 4 2
[35:46] you find the throne
[35:49] and then you find one sitting on the
[35:51] throne
[35:54] but remember whatever happens there
[35:59] it's got to be matched here
[36:02] right
[36:04] whatever happens here
[36:06] let me put it maybe in the correct form
[36:07] where it ought to be whatever happens
[36:09] here has got to be there first
[36:12] right
[36:14] so by the baptism of the holy ghost we
[36:15] come to the new birth the father is
[36:17] strong dwelling in our hearts and our
[36:19] lives
[36:21] that makes it to where that when we pass
[36:23] away
[36:25] can we go right straight into his
[36:27] presence
[36:29] but where's his presence
[36:32] we don't go into the seventh dimension
[36:36] we go to the sixth
[36:39] where brother branham said i want to see
[36:40] jesus
[36:42] he said you can't see him
[36:43] because he's a little higher
[36:46] meaning there's another step
[36:49] to this whole thing
[36:51] that would have to take place someday
[36:54] to connect us together all right
[36:57] but look what he says
[37:00] look what he says here in hebrews
[37:01] chapter 2
[37:03] 1957 if you can pull this one up
[37:05] or be 21
[37:07] if you can get down to that point
[37:10] follow him
[37:12] now he's talking about
[37:14] coming down and ascend on high and gave
[37:16] gifts unto men
[37:17] and it was an atmosphere above of
[37:19] darkness and gloom and death
[37:21] prayers couldn't go through because the
[37:23] atonement wasn't made
[37:25] he broke through that he opened the way
[37:27] he broke the veil of sickness he broke
[37:29] the veil of sin
[37:31] he broke the veil of
[37:32] weary
[37:33] he broke the veil of depressed he broke
[37:36] every veil and made a highway
[37:38] with a wayfiring man walking up the
[37:41] king's highway
[37:43] oh my when he passed the moon and the
[37:45] stars and on and on you remember the
[37:46] king's highway where you sing that song
[37:49] walking up the king's highway
[37:51] all right
[37:52] see he made a way
[37:54] following him
[37:56] come the old testament saints
[38:00] now are you reading it
[38:01] following him
[38:03] from the old testament saints
[38:05] abraham isaac and jacob they went right
[38:08] on up into the heavens of heavens
[38:13] when they were way away from the city
[38:18] remember in timothy
[38:21] the heavenly jerusalem the city
[38:25] so they're going to the city
[38:28] i can see them lift up their eyes
[38:30] abraham said that's the city i longed to
[38:32] see
[38:33] and come here isaac
[38:35] come here jacob oh my we're we were
[38:38] pilgrim and strangers of the earth but
[38:40] there's the city there's the one we've
[38:43] waited
[38:44] on i said don't tie that up to the
[38:47] future home
[38:48] because jesus is under construction of
[38:50] the future home
[38:52] right
[38:53] and the bible said
[38:55] they scream lift up your everlasting
[38:57] gates
[38:58] and be lifted up for the king of glory
[39:00] to come in
[39:01] and the angels behind the gates screamed
[39:04] back to those angels back here and said
[39:08] who is this king of glory
[39:10] and the angels out here the prophets
[39:13] said the lord of hosts
[39:16] the mighty in battle
[39:18] and they pressed the buttons
[39:20] and the big
[39:23] door swung open
[39:24] right down through the middle of the
[39:26] streets he come
[39:27] the conqueror now where is he going
[39:31] triumph with the old testament saints
[39:34] walking behind him
[39:39] sat down on the throne said father here
[39:43] they are they're yours
[39:46] are you with me
[39:48] he said climb up here
[39:50] and sit down until i make your enemies
[39:53] your footstool
[39:54] as we read we find
[39:56] that on here in the scripture all right
[40:01] now where'd he go
[40:03] where'd the old testament sayings go
[40:04] with him
[40:06] up to chapter 5
[40:07] to the father strong
[40:10] right
[40:11] now off into another
[40:13] great dimensional some situation
[40:16] you got it placed correctly roll it on
[40:18] up watch what he says
[40:21] listen now
[40:23] we're on the eighth verse
[40:25] and we're going to get some of these
[40:26] scriptures today but mainly we'll be on
[40:28] them wednesday okay
[40:32] then has he put all things under
[40:34] subjection under his feet
[40:38] now you know what that scripture's
[40:39] saying
[40:41] he put all things in subjection under
[40:43] his feet he left nothing that is not
[40:46] under him
[40:49] but now we see not all things put under
[40:52] him
[40:55] that's the scripture now we'll get back
[40:56] to it in a minute
[40:59] that's death
[41:01] we don't see death
[41:03] yet because we're still dying
[41:07] we see death
[41:09] see we don't see death destroyed look
[41:11] but we see jesus
[41:14] who was made a little lower than the
[41:16] angels for the suffering of death
[41:18] crowned with glory and honor
[41:20] that he by the grace of god should taste
[41:22] death for every man
[41:25] all right
[41:28] look at your friend
[41:29] don't ever forget this when jesus was
[41:32] going walking up the hill
[41:35] death was buzzing around his head
[41:42] death took him
[41:44] but he conquered death
[41:49] he overcame death
[41:52] he went to the father's throne
[41:55] and overcame death
[41:57] all right but we don't see death
[42:00] destroyed at this moment
[42:02] i said we'll get back to these
[42:03] scriptures wednesday
[42:06] and try to cover them in a lineup
[42:10] we don't see death destroyed
[42:14] right is that what he just said
[42:19] it says in first corinthians 15 20
[42:22] 6
[42:23] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[42:26] is death
[42:34] but we don't see death destroyed
[42:38] but we see jesus
[42:42] and in this last day remember we were
[42:45] talking in
[42:47] timothy
[42:49] at his appearing
[42:52] which is supposed to be this day
[42:55] life and immortality to be brought to
[42:57] light through the gospel
[43:01] that no man has ever been able to
[43:02] approach unto
[43:04] somebody will in this day
[43:08] somebody will
[43:10] conquer death
[43:12] right
[43:13] so then you see why i say it in what i
[43:15] believe
[43:18] that if those old testament saints
[43:22] went in in glorified bodies death has
[43:24] done been annihilated back there and
[43:26] you've got a long lot of scriptures
[43:29] that should have never even been written
[43:32] because you would just say it was done
[43:33] now
[43:34] but he said even jesus
[43:39] death destroyed him
[43:41] but yet he raised
[43:43] and conquered it
[43:44] but he conquered it only for himself
[43:48] now get that right
[43:50] he conquered it for you and i right we
[43:52] know that but it wasn't applied
[43:55] at that time it was only applied to him
[44:01] and he was the only one
[44:03] who dwelled in immortality
[44:07] but chapter 5 shows him sitting there on
[44:09] the father's throne
[44:12] because we see jesus
[44:16] we don't see death destroyed
[44:20] but we see jesus
[44:23] we see the capability of it being
[44:25] destroyed
[44:27] because it was destroyed as i was ending
[44:29] up this morning
[44:31] he went through death burial
[44:33] resurrection
[44:36] right
[44:37] eternity in flesh
[44:39] raptured up
[44:42] right
[44:44] and see when we go through that
[44:48] then
[44:51] death will be destroyed
[44:55] and see if they went to immortality
[45:01] look what he goes on to say in number 25
[45:05] the faith of abraham
[45:07] how wonderful
[45:09] good
[45:10] some glorious day
[45:12] the last enemy i have
[45:14] which is death
[45:16] will be trampled right under the feet
[45:19] as was the conqueror
[45:22] we shall march through the city
[45:27] what is that city
[45:30] he said it's the heavenly jerusalem
[45:36] it's a place where god is at
[45:38] right
[45:41] it's a city it's not just a
[45:44] doing but it's not the future home that
[45:46] will come into being because of this
[45:48] city
[45:49] we're we're today compassed about with a
[45:52] great cloud of witnesses
[45:57] saying come on you know
[46:02] you know
[46:04] a great cloud of witnesses that didn't
[46:07] fail
[46:09] they achieved what god had ordained for
[46:11] them to do remember that
[46:14] what god said they would do they done it
[46:18] right
[46:19] but in doing that did not give them
[46:21] eternal life
[46:25] he had to give them eternal life
[46:29] and it was not given as a new birth
[46:32] we use it as that of saying a new birth
[46:34] or something like but it's not it's not
[46:36] correct they know they don't receive the
[46:38] new birth
[46:39] they received an impartation
[46:43] of eternal life
[46:44] because they rejected
[46:47] the right of the new birth right
[46:50] those old testament saints rejected
[46:52] jesus christ
[46:55] now some of them we would talk about
[46:57] abraham and them well and good
[47:01] but just remember the things they went
[47:03] through
[47:04] through
[47:06] in their lives
[47:08] took them to the grave
[47:11] even though they fulfilled what god said
[47:13] about him
[47:17] they went to the grave
[47:19] even the great enoch that walked off the
[47:21] earth
[47:22] where's his body there's no record
[47:26] the great elijah that took a chariot
[47:28] horse ride and went up
[47:30] but where's his body
[47:32] the great moses that the prophet said
[47:34] frankly i don't believe he was buried
[47:39] he just took a trip home
[47:41] you know that moses and elijah appears
[47:44] over in
[47:46] what luke
[47:47] 16 is that whatever matthew 16
[47:50] which one it is where it says this is my
[47:52] beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[47:54] here ye him
[47:55] when he appears with the with the lord
[47:58] jesus
[47:59] all right
[48:02] and brother ryan said that's the second
[48:03] coming of jesus christ
[48:06] and you know even the two witnesses
[48:09] that will have the spirit of elijah
[48:11] and moses
[48:13] they're going to be killed
[48:17] the bible says and lay in the streets
[48:18] for three and a half days
[48:23] the 144 thousand will be killed
[48:28] as their brethren were killed
[48:31] nobody as i ended this morning talking
[48:34] about it
[48:35] nobody
[48:37] outside of the bride of christ
[48:40] can do what jesus done
[48:43] he went through death
[48:45] burial
[48:46] resurrection
[48:48] changed
[48:50] and went up the rapture
[48:53] the bride of jesus christ is the only
[48:55] group of people that can follow that
[48:57] channel and walk into immortality
[49:02] you know what
[49:03] it'll be done right here
[49:08] the dead's going to be raised right here
[49:12] by the voice of the bride of jesus
[49:14] christ right
[49:20] we're going to be
[49:22] made eternal or changed as paul said
[49:25] in a moment a twinkle of an eye
[49:29] and then we'll go meet the lord in the
[49:30] air
[49:33] and paul said having bodies like unto
[49:35] his glorious body
[49:38] and be like him
[49:41] the plan of
[49:42] redemption ties together then with
[49:45] everybody
[49:47] and everybody is dependent upon whether
[49:49] or not we can reach this goal
[49:54] all of those back there
[49:56] remember the quote we read
[49:58] they looked
[49:59] at the cross
[50:01] we look through the cross backwards
[50:03] forward every direction
[50:05] all right we see through the cross
[50:08] jesus christ
[50:11] that life and immortality
[50:13] is brought to light
[50:16] through the gospel
[50:18] and i don't mean this to people but i
[50:21] mean it as straight as i can say it
[50:23] a lot of us come from organized religion
[50:25] right
[50:26] one way or the other sometime or other
[50:30] and what was there talking about back
[50:32] there
[50:35] did they talk about a rapture
[50:39] might have mentioned this
[50:41] did they talk about being changed
[50:45] might have mentioned it
[50:47] but where did anybody back there say
[50:50] the lord himself shall descend from
[50:51] heaven even though it was written in the
[50:53] word
[50:59] the lord himself shall descend from
[51:01] heaven with a shout
[51:05] now
[51:06] i'll review a lot of this wednesday
[51:08] because i want to stay on this
[51:11] death being destroyed
[51:13] but i want you to think about it
[51:16] i want you to think about
[51:20] that
[51:23] you and i have the opportunity
[51:29] the only people that has that
[51:30] opportunity
[51:34] to be able to be changed in a moment a
[51:36] twinkle of an eye
[51:40] now let's take the great apostle paul
[51:45] and i'll go back to your wednesday
[51:47] but i want this in your mind the great
[51:49] apostle paul
[51:50] in corinthians
[51:54] he talks about mortal
[51:57] chains to immortality
[52:00] how corruptable
[52:02] will put on incorruption
[52:05] he sums it up
[52:07] now watch progressive revelation i know
[52:10] a lot of people don't like that word
[52:11] progressive but deeper meaning or
[52:13] opening to deeper depths
[52:15] all right
[52:16] paul there's talking about
[52:20] death
[52:23] and he comes down to speaking of death
[52:28] he says when death is destroyed
[52:32] he said then it's brought to pass the
[52:34] same
[52:36] then see sometime
[52:41] death where's your sting
[52:43] grave where's your victory
[52:47] i don't know how much longer or whether
[52:49] it was before i'm not worried about it
[52:53] that he wrote to the corinthians about
[52:54] that
[52:57] but when he wrote at the thessalonians
[53:00] he explained
[53:02] how death
[53:04] would be destroyed
[53:08] do you understand what i mean
[53:13] even he himself never attained unto what
[53:15] he said right
[53:18] but yet he's seen it
[53:21] and he's saying in corinthians
[53:23] that there was a possibility
[53:26] of a mortal
[53:29] being changed into immortality
[53:33] and then all that death
[53:35] would be done away
[53:39] he could make that statement death
[53:42] where's your sting great where's your
[53:43] victory
[53:45] we have the victory through jesus christ
[53:48] the same statement he made when he said
[53:50] we don't see all things destroyed
[53:53] but we see jesus
[53:58] the possibility of it being destroyed
[54:00] but when he comes to the thessalonians
[54:06] it strikes him
[54:10] paul
[54:11] how is death going to be destroyed
[54:19] he said that the last
[54:23] you trump
[54:24] for the trumpet shall sound
[54:29] and the dead in christ
[54:32] shall rise
[54:34] and we which are alive and remain
[54:37] shall be caught up together
[54:39] to meet the lord in the air
[54:43] gave the complete plan until brother
[54:45] random when he came to that message of
[54:47] the rapture
[54:48] you know in the things of his message
[54:52] he said
[54:54] shout
[54:56] voice of an archangel the trumpet
[55:00] he said we've already heard the shout
[55:02] he said because that's the message
[55:07] what message
[55:09] his message
[55:11] that life
[55:12] and immortality is brought to light
[55:16] by this end time message
[55:21] we could see it
[55:25] and he said then
[55:28] the shout and the voice of the archangel
[55:30] he said the same
[55:32] loud voice
[55:34] that raised lazarus
[55:37] where's he going to be at in the bride
[55:41] and then a trumpet he said a gospel
[55:44] trumpet or something
[55:48] would take place
[55:50] and we'll go meet the lord in the air
[55:55] how much more beautiful could the plan
[55:57] of redemption be laid out in the
[55:58] scriptures for you and i do and i said
[56:00] we'll talk pick back up some wednesday
[56:02] because i want to get in the description
[56:03] just go real slow
[56:05] down through you know
[56:07] and talk about it
[56:09] but i want you to think about it
[56:12] he's already done it
[56:16] it's finished as far as god is concerned
[56:19] but it's not finished as far as we're
[56:22] concerned
[56:24] now you'll see why i've dwelt so much on
[56:26] a positive attitude
[56:30] see
[56:32] martin luther
[56:34] preached no telling how many sermons on
[56:37] the judge shall live by faith
[56:41] and he came forth
[56:43] no telling how many sermons he preached
[56:48] but yet one day
[56:51] he read it one more time
[56:54] and when he did
[56:56] he come off the pages into the man's
[56:59] heart
[57:01] of what god had called him for
[57:04] he saw his day in its message
[57:08] the people when they saw it like luther
[57:10] not the ones that went out and burnt the
[57:11] buildings down
[57:13] protesting the catholic church but the
[57:15] ones who really
[57:17] saw what the man was saying
[57:18] turned the world upside down
[57:21] because they had a positive attitude
[57:24] westley done it pentecost done it
[57:28] brother branham done it
[57:30] has anybody ever been as positive as
[57:33] that man preached
[57:36] that's what caught me
[57:39] i had read the bible and talked of a god
[57:42] that lived
[57:44] i had seen that god that lived
[57:49] i knew he lived
[57:51] there was no way to take it out of me
[57:52] that he lived
[57:54] but i couldn't find anybody to talk to
[57:56] me about
[57:57] the god that i could see that was living
[58:03] you know a lot of people come into this
[58:05] message because they find out organized
[58:07] religion is wrong
[58:09] right
[58:10] well then that's all they fool with
[58:14] no matter why you see them go back where
[58:15] they come from
[58:19] right i guess they found out it wasn't
[58:20] as wrong they thought it was but
[58:24] but that was not what it was when i come
[58:25] in the message
[58:28] i saw a man with a positive attitude
[58:31] that was talking about a god
[58:33] that i believed in
[58:38] never had an experience of salvation of
[58:40] that god
[58:42] but had contact with him
[58:46] believed him
[58:49] and tried to follow him
[58:52] one day when i heard about this brother
[58:54] moak said you know a prophet's been in
[58:56] the land
[58:59] he said i've seen the dead raised the
[59:01] sick healed
[59:04] said
[59:05] that's good
[59:06] i believe you
[59:08] he said you know robert tatum i sure do
[59:11] know him all his life and the family and
[59:13] every club
[59:14] he said well he'll tell you about it i
[59:15] said look brother that's all well and
[59:18] good
[59:20] that's over with
[59:22] i said would you tell me what the man
[59:24] taught
[59:28] i'll know whether he was a prophet or
[59:30] not
[59:33] i'm glad i run into the man i did that i
[59:36] didn't run into these
[59:38] fly-by-nights in the message you gotta
[59:40] believe he was a prophet he believed
[59:42] he's a prophet everything's all right
[59:45] just come in a minute just believe he's
[59:46] a prophet
[59:48] no
[59:49] i run into a man that could quote three
[59:51] quarters of the bible
[59:53] from memory
[59:56] and i thank god for it
[1:00:02] and i began to study for myself
[1:00:07] and laid my baptist classes down
[1:00:14] yeah
[1:00:15] you know what a lot of people was doing
[1:00:16] they picked them up in this message call
[1:00:18] them two souls and seven thunder virtue
[1:00:20] and all those other things but
[1:00:22] that's beside the point
[1:00:27] but i began to see a man talking about a
[1:00:29] god that lived
[1:00:32] not back younger
[1:00:36] we believed in healing
[1:00:38] we believed in praying
[1:00:42] you know
[1:00:44] we believed in those things
[1:00:46] we were raised up in a period of time
[1:00:48] that you had to believe
[1:00:50] you know
[1:00:52] didn't have all of the
[1:00:54] social security security's the
[1:00:55] guarantees we've got today
[1:01:01] but yet i began to see a god that was
[1:01:03] real
[1:01:06] and you know what it brought to me
[1:01:08] now listen it brought a hope
[1:01:14] you know
[1:01:17] because listen to what i'm saying
[1:01:20] because if he hadn't made something
[1:01:22] personal to me about this message
[1:01:27] then i only had a hope
[1:01:31] and a belief in a doctrine
[1:01:34] or a man that believed in god
[1:01:37] and that god could use
[1:01:41] but you see one day
[1:01:43] i found that god
[1:01:47] that god wouldn't william branham
[1:01:50] that god was the same one that i had
[1:01:52] followed along all of my life
[1:01:56] but i had him off let me just say a
[1:01:58] little bit about this morning
[1:02:00] i had him off the throne
[1:02:04] go read and listen to the things where
[1:02:07] brother around talks about revelations 4
[1:02:10] and 5 and see if he doesn't cover it
[1:02:12] this way
[1:02:14] we had him dethroned
[1:02:16] the trinity doctrine dethrones jesus
[1:02:19] christ totally off of all thrones father
[1:02:22] whatever you want to talk about
[1:02:26] and i just ask you
[1:02:28] has he ever climbed up on your throne
[1:02:31] in your heart in your life and set down
[1:02:35] in you by revelation
[1:02:39] that no matter what comes or goes
[1:02:43] then no matter what the future holds of
[1:02:45] what's to be done
[1:02:51] that he's still hebrews 13 8.
[1:02:58] have you ever had that personal
[1:02:59] experience
[1:03:02] well brother dale i've never had an
[1:03:03] experience like you everybody don't have
[1:03:06] the same experience i'm glad of that
[1:03:08] now let me put it in the right order i
[1:03:10] believe everybody has the same
[1:03:11] experience but it's in different ways to
[1:03:14] have it because i believe only in one
[1:03:17] experience
[1:03:18] and that is the new birth
[1:03:21] and that way it may have come to you
[1:03:23] with you crying shouting glory
[1:03:25] hallelujah whatever or a thought or of
[1:03:28] what point or a word or whatever
[1:03:32] but it's the same new birth
[1:03:35] or else hebrews 13 8 is wrong
[1:03:41] but has he climbed up on your throne
[1:03:44] and said i am in your heart in your life
[1:03:48] can you read the bible and see
[1:03:51] a true understanding of one true and
[1:03:53] living god
[1:03:57] and not wonder whether the trinity's
[1:03:59] right even though brother branham will
[1:04:00] stand and say i said let's stand and
[1:04:02] address the third person of the trinity
[1:04:06] he was a trinitarian he's been that all
[1:04:08] alone
[1:04:09] but he just now told it and i'm the only
[1:04:11] one that called he said that
[1:04:15] now ain't that real good
[1:04:24] he said he wouldn't preach on hell until
[1:04:26] he'd seen what it was
[1:04:28] because he couldn't understand it
[1:04:32] he said one time it looked like his
[1:04:33] eternal enough time it looked like it
[1:04:34] wasn't
[1:04:36] and you want me to find you a quote
[1:04:37] where he said you folks be careful
[1:04:39] because you could die and burn in hell
[1:04:41] eternally
[1:04:45] see there he really believed in eternal
[1:04:46] hell but he just hid that from everybody
[1:04:49] else
[1:04:51] you got the great revelation that's
[1:04:52] where doctrines get started
[1:04:57] of a great revelation
[1:05:00] well
[1:05:02] let's see how was it he said one time
[1:05:03] about people that believe the trinity
[1:05:06] he said i just don't have that much of a
[1:05:08] revelation something to that degree
[1:05:10] he said because it just wouldn't work
[1:05:15] but are you following me
[1:05:17] because my point of this evening is to
[1:05:19] one time
[1:05:22] to get you to realize no matter what
[1:05:26] we're still dying
[1:05:30] and if we're still dying
[1:05:33] then
[1:05:35] everybody else
[1:05:37] is still dying
[1:05:41] but do you realize when this bride walks
[1:05:43] off of this earth
[1:05:47] it won't make 144 000 eternal
[1:05:52] they got to get their own revelation
[1:05:57] but you know what
[1:06:00] without us they can't get it
[1:06:04] because this is the last in morphe
[1:06:06] to the gentile dispensation
[1:06:10] is the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:14] see i believe then that life and
[1:06:17] has been brought to light
[1:06:20] through the gospel that you and i
[1:06:25] what is paul saying there in romans
[1:06:26] about the
[1:06:28] the gospel it's the power of god under
[1:06:30] salvation
[1:06:33] to everyone that believeth
[1:06:37] i'm looking for a change of these bodies
[1:06:41] it's always been my thought
[1:06:44] well what we need to do is we need to
[1:06:47] get this get that we'll go right ahead
[1:06:51] we need to be more emotional brother
[1:06:53] dale
[1:06:54] well all right
[1:06:57] like i told him down atlanta one time
[1:06:59] that brother
[1:07:00] roberts
[1:07:01] he was talking about running and i said
[1:07:03] well just make sure you don't slow down
[1:07:05] i might be behind you
[1:07:10] but you know what we want everybody else
[1:07:12] to be emotional
[1:07:14] and when everybody's not emotional like
[1:07:16] we think it ought to be then we don't
[1:07:18] think nobody's got nothing
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:27] but you see i've always been built on
[1:07:29] one thing
[1:07:32] tell me what the word says and i'll know
[1:07:34] where brother adam was a prophet
[1:07:38] show me that word revealed in a group of
[1:07:40] people in their hearts and i'll know
[1:07:42] that god is real
[1:07:49] somebody's going to have to stand on
[1:07:50] this earth
[1:07:52] and declare
[1:07:53] that death is destroyed
[1:07:56] and we'll still be dying
[1:08:01] still be getting older
[1:08:07] it's not no shame to die
[1:08:12] that's in the providence of god
[1:08:15] but somebody
[1:08:17] is going to believe it
[1:08:19] well why can't we believe we're there
[1:08:23] you know
[1:08:26] and realize what's going on
[1:08:29] but you know what most people won't they
[1:08:31] won't just like i just clicked i said i
[1:08:32] clicked
[1:08:33] on i think i told my life now i was just
[1:08:36] doing something looking for something on
[1:08:37] the computer yesterday and
[1:08:39] i clicked on and it said something about
[1:08:41] something
[1:08:42] and i clicked on and i thought well
[1:08:45] it says that man knows what he's talking
[1:08:47] about
[1:08:48] said something about the great
[1:08:50] destruction or the downfall of america
[1:08:53] and i listened to him for a little while
[1:08:55] and you know he had some good things
[1:08:58] he says within a very short amount of
[1:08:59] years that your grocery bill is going to
[1:09:02] double and triple
[1:09:04] he said your gasoline is going to go he
[1:09:07] said your money in the bank
[1:09:10] is going to be gone
[1:09:12] you cannot get it out of the bank
[1:09:13] because the banks will be closed
[1:09:16] he said it and listen this is what
[1:09:17] caught me he said there will be a
[1:09:20] military takeover
[1:09:23] in this country
[1:09:26] and said obama signed the papers
[1:09:29] a couple of days ago
[1:09:32] and he gave the bill number 1827
[1:09:36] or something
[1:09:38] and said he signed that
[1:09:40] and there's your beginning
[1:09:46] um you know that kind of sounds like
[1:09:49] brother branham talking don't it
[1:09:51] then how that there would be a great
[1:09:53] depression how did they be great times
[1:09:54] and how we would be physically bereft
[1:09:57] how that we would lose all and
[1:09:59] how that we'd be at the mercy of the
[1:10:01] elements
[1:10:02] how your money would be gone
[1:10:06] keep your homes
[1:10:09] and be of what is it keep your home and
[1:10:11] be a member of the catholic church or
[1:10:12] something like that there's a quote
[1:10:13] something to not paraphrase in it but
[1:10:16] it's close about keeping your home
[1:10:19] take the mark of the beast all right
[1:10:24] listen what do you mean keep my home
[1:10:29] well
[1:10:31] be careful what you sign
[1:10:33] you might be signing your rights away
[1:10:38] you know
[1:10:39] i'm not a doomsday i've never been that
[1:10:42] away because i believe the revealed word
[1:10:46] is the thing
[1:10:48] because you know there's not going to be
[1:10:49] a doomsday if somebody don't raise up in
[1:10:52] the bride of christ
[1:10:54] and proclaim that i and my father are
[1:10:55] one you ain't going to see nothing
[1:10:58] tiring up and doing we're just going to
[1:10:59] keep on going and we're going to be
[1:11:01] fighting around horeb you know 40
[1:11:03] something years they went around
[1:11:04] horrible
[1:11:06] couldn't have been but just a few miles
[1:11:07] that they were walking
[1:11:09] i think after a while i'd say hey look
[1:11:11] boys that was my footprint
[1:11:14] i've been here before
[1:11:17] maybe about 30 years ago
[1:11:19] you know
[1:11:22] and that's what i think about you and i
[1:11:26] are we really
[1:11:29] is our thoughts
[1:11:31] thinking about
[1:11:33] getting out of here
[1:11:35] or trying to live here
[1:11:42] what about it
[1:11:45] come on brothers what about it
[1:11:51] life and immortality
[1:11:53] is brought to light
[1:11:56] to the gospel
[1:12:00] and if it's brought to light
[1:12:02] it's a possibility
[1:12:03] of somebody
[1:12:05] attaining
[1:12:07] to that place
[1:12:11] why can't we believe we're them
[1:12:17] you know that i've heard people say
[1:12:20] i believe that i'm in the bride i don't
[1:12:22] know whether i'm going in rapture or not
[1:12:27] i thought
[1:12:29] and don't calculate
[1:12:31] you know but you believe your bribers
[1:12:33] don't know where you're going in the
[1:12:34] rapture or not
[1:12:38] if you are the bride that is the rapture
[1:12:44] we see like one brother said he said
[1:12:46] something like this that that adoption
[1:12:48] is deep it said that statue of perfect
[1:12:49] man is simple
[1:12:52] something like that
[1:12:54] your people make those statements and
[1:12:56] you wonder
[1:12:57] where's their thinking when it's all the
[1:12:59] same thing
[1:13:00] is that your perfect man is adoption
[1:13:07] but how about it
[1:13:10] do we believe him to be the same
[1:13:12] in every way
[1:13:16] outside of the fact of the corporal body
[1:13:18] being here
[1:13:24] now that's what brother brown says
[1:13:27] you say well now i believe in a way
[1:13:30] brown said there's no such thing
[1:13:33] as believing in a way
[1:13:37] he said he's either hebrews 13 8
[1:13:41] or not
[1:13:45] do we have everything based on that or
[1:13:46] do we have everything based on
[1:13:51] our social security check
[1:13:55] you know what
[1:13:56] you know if you cut off all the social
[1:13:58] security check you know most people
[1:13:59] wouldn't be in this building today they
[1:14:01] wouldn't be able to afford to get here
[1:14:04] and you know what every day it gets up
[1:14:05] more and more of us
[1:14:12] you see folks i've always just tried to
[1:14:14] be one thing and that's straight and
[1:14:15] honest and right up the line
[1:14:18] right around talking about money he said
[1:14:20] if you knew what you had in your pocket
[1:14:22] you'd take it out and burn it
[1:14:26] but you know what he never took his out
[1:14:29] and burn it
[1:14:34] he's using it
[1:14:37] but he knew what it consists of
[1:14:41] but he knew there's no way for us to
[1:14:42] operate without money
[1:14:44] you've got to have a monetary system of
[1:14:46] some form
[1:14:51] you know that in a monetary system in
[1:14:53] the crisis
[1:14:54] gold is the only thing's tradable
[1:14:57] how much gold do we have
[1:15:03] kind of hard to bind it up by the crazy
[1:15:05] entity
[1:15:07] that's one of the things that man said
[1:15:09] he said
[1:15:10] your
[1:15:12] money
[1:15:13] golden things won't be any good
[1:15:16] why
[1:15:18] because if you let them know you got it
[1:15:20] they're gonna come get it
[1:15:24] you're gonna go out and pay for food
[1:15:25] brother collie with gold nuggets
[1:15:28] and they gonna ask you what well you've
[1:15:29] been digging in
[1:15:35] there's
[1:15:36] no way of hiding and
[1:15:40] doing things
[1:15:43] we might as well just be straight and
[1:15:44] honest
[1:15:45] but be ready every moment
[1:15:50] right
[1:15:52] let's stand together
[1:15:55] the light enemy to be destroyed
[1:15:58] is death
[1:16:01] now how are we going to destroy it
[1:16:06] well we'll just quit dying we'll help
[1:16:08] yourself
[1:16:12] i don't think that's the way it is
[1:16:18] i think it's going to have to be
[1:16:19] something else
[1:16:21] don't you
[1:16:24] no
[1:16:26] don't know if anybody's interested or
[1:16:28] not but they were showing on the
[1:16:31] internet this morning that the moon will
[1:16:33] turn to blood wednesday night for about
[1:16:35] an hour
[1:16:36] i've never seen it so i'm curious if
[1:16:39] anybody else will be turned into blood
[1:16:41] wednesday night
[1:16:42] for about an
[1:16:47] from a big hour or something
[1:16:50] something was gonna happen
[1:16:54] okay
[1:16:56] oh
[1:16:57] losing who's in charge we're gonna find
[1:16:59] number three and
[1:17:01] anybody have a need just think about it
[1:17:02] my only thing is to get you to see
[1:17:05] jesus christ
[1:17:08] they come from the east and west
[1:17:12] to see jesus christ that's the only one
[1:17:25] no hopes outside of jesus christ
[1:17:51] everybody's gone today so we wouldn't
[1:17:54] have a few cups
[1:17:58] i'm not saying anything about people
[1:18:00] going
[1:18:02] i'm just saying we're going to well next
[1:18:03] week
[1:18:06] or that a lot of people can be here
[1:18:08] but i want to see these ministers get
[1:18:10] out and go
[1:18:12] and preach the gospel
[1:18:14] spread the good news
[1:18:19] that's what we believe right
[1:18:21] anybody have a name
[1:18:24] this is a mystery
[1:19:04] needed a redeemer no longer
[1:19:16] we don't understand everything but we
[1:19:18] know something darkness
[1:19:27] for jesus has set me free
[1:19:32] of that holy place
[1:19:36] and open by night and day
[1:19:41] where did those old testament signs go
[1:19:44] right into the presence of almighty god
[1:19:48] we're do all born-again believers go
[1:19:50] today
[1:19:51] right in the presence of almighty god
[1:19:56] but yet
[1:19:57] there's something not done away
[1:20:02] we're still dying
[1:20:05] somebody's going to look at that and say
[1:20:07] jesus
[1:20:09] you don't get me
[1:20:11] i'm happy his heart can be
[1:20:31] passed away
[1:20:34] that undertaker he said
[1:20:37] jesus
[1:20:38] what are y'all just anyway
[1:20:40] oh jesus said i said
[1:20:43] sir you won't say anything
[1:20:55] he looked at me and said what i said i'm
[1:20:56] a metal baptized
[1:21:02] i'd hate to have to write that on your
[1:21:04] death certificate i said i don't intend
[1:21:07] for you to be able to
[1:21:10] i mean i want to be changed
[1:21:27] is your kiss so sweet to me
[1:21:32] with this black ops 9
[1:21:36] but darkness has taken flight
[1:21:40] now
[1:21:52] you love his word
[1:22:06] walking with him
[1:22:21] i'm going to praise
[1:22:31] i
[1:22:32] will reign within
[1:22:38] just think about him as we dismiss
[1:22:41] lord jesus
[1:22:42] we love you
[1:22:44] we pray that what we said today has been
[1:22:46] worthy
[1:22:48] to express our thoughts and our ideas
[1:22:52] we pray that they've been in your accord
[1:22:54] tonight
[1:22:55] because that's what we desire it to be
[1:22:58] but the one thing we desire lord and
[1:23:00] that is to
[1:23:03] come to a place that somebody will be
[1:23:06] able to look at death and say
[1:23:09] this move on away from us
[1:23:13] because that would give a hope and an
[1:23:15] opportunity
[1:23:16] to anybody else
[1:23:19] it's for somebody to be able to do that
[1:23:22] we know you've done it
[1:23:24] and we know the only way it'll ever be
[1:23:26] done is for you to come in us and do it
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:29] because we can't do it ourselves
[1:23:32] but we believe that the bride is to be
[1:23:35] the fullness of the godhead bodily the
[1:23:37] bride is to be the final voice to the
[1:23:39] final age
[1:23:41] she is to be the son of man
[1:23:44] made manifest
[1:23:47] in a many member body
[1:23:50] we love you and we thank you take care
[1:23:51] of everybody on the way home bless all
[1:23:53] the people that are not here and they're
[1:23:54] traveling back this afternoon and home
[1:23:57] and all like that lord just be with them
[1:23:59] give a safe journey
[1:24:01] we love you
[1:24:02] we thank you in jesus name
[1:24:05] amen you're dismissed
[1:24:12] b minor down indeed
[1:24:16] you better go down
