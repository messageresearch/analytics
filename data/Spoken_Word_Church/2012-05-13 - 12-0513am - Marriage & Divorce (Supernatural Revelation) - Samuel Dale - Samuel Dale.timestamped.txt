[3:56] marriage and divorce I was going to you
[3:59] know the grace part to try to speak on
[4:02] it for at least one service or something
[4:03] but we will try to pick up that this
[4:06] afternoon because there's something here
[4:08] I want us to cover to be able to see it
[4:11] and understand okay so Matthew 19.
[4:18] and then we'll go to Romans
[4:21] 7.
[4:23] first three and the Pharisees came into
[4:24] him tempting him and saying unto him is
[4:27] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[4:29] forever cause and he answered and said
[4:31] unto them have you not read that he
[4:33] which made them at the beginning made
[4:35] them male and female and he said for
[4:37] this call shall a man leave father and
[4:39] mother and she'll cleave to his wife and
[4:41] they claim shall be one flesh wherefore
[4:44] they are no more Twain but one flesh but
[4:47] therefore God hath joined together let
[4:49] not man put a Sunder they say unto him
[4:51] why did Moses then command to give a
[4:55] writing or divorcement and to put her
[4:56] away
[4:57] he said unto them Moses because of the
[5:00] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[5:02] put away your wife but from the
[5:04] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[5:06] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[5:09] accepted me for fornication
[5:11] and shall marry another committee's
[5:13] adultery and whosoever married her which
[5:15] is put away death commit adultery like
[5:18] Romans
[5:20] seven
[5:23] verse one know ye therefore brethren for
[5:27] I speak to them that know the law and
[5:29] that the law had dominion over man as
[5:31] long as he liveth or the woman which
[5:33] happened husband is bound by the law to
[5:35] her husband so long as he liveth but if
[5:38] the husband he did she had lose from the
[5:40] law of her husband so then if while her
[5:43] husband liveth she'd be married to
[5:46] another man she shall be called an
[5:47] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[5:50] she is free from that law so that she is
[5:53] no adulteress no should be married to
[5:54] another man
[5:56] we're for my brother and you also are
[5:58] are become dead to the law by the body
[6:00] of Christ that you should be married to
[6:02] another even to him who is raised from
[6:04] the dead
[6:05] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[6:08] God for when we were in the flesh the
[6:10] Motions of the sin which were by the law
[6:12] did work in our members bring forth
[6:15] fruit unto death
[6:17] but now we are delivered from the law
[6:19] that being dead wherein we were held
[6:22] that we should serve in the newness of
[6:23] the spirit and not in the oldness of the
[6:25] letter
[6:26] let's just
[6:28] you know let's read verse 7 because when
[6:31] we're tied together for him what shall
[6:33] we say then is the law of sin God forbid
[6:36] nay I had not known sin but by the law
[6:39] for I had not known lust except the law
[6:41] had said Thou shalt not covet amen you
[6:45] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[6:46] to the reading of the word now
[6:50] verse 7 we'll try to tie it in
[6:54] to uh what we're getting close to this
[6:57] afternoon if we don't have time we'll do
[6:59] we'll just do on that all right now
[7:05] we've covered
[7:07] at Lent
[7:09] and I'm sure it's not being lengthy
[7:11] enough to
[7:12] to help everybody to understand but to
[7:14] try to do the best we can
[7:16] to try to cover you know the uh
[7:19] situations of life and the things of
[7:22] marriage and divorce and you know seeing
[7:25] and talking about uh who can divorce and
[7:30] who cannot and we see that the woman
[7:31] cannot divorce her husband her husband
[7:34] must be dead you know but he can't
[7:36] divorce his wife for just anything it
[7:40] has to be a fornication and then we
[7:43] covered fornication and adultery has the
[7:46] same wording and then we uh stated I did
[7:49] for my own statement to you and to those
[7:52] who want to hear it that so you can say
[7:55] well I've got my wife away for
[7:57] fornication but if she commits adultery
[7:58] then I can't do it you know and marry
[8:00] again well I I don't believe it that way
[8:03] I'm just telling you I believe if your
[8:05] your wife commits adultery against you
[8:08] and there's no way of reconciling that
[8:10] back because brother Reynolds says you
[8:12] know that uh
[8:15] I believe if I run around on my wife she
[8:17] did she forgive me you know and he said
[8:20] I'd forgive her so I say if it cannot be
[8:23] reconciled then uh the husband could
[8:26] divorce his wife and because of her
[8:29] committing adultery which is the work
[8:31] same word fornication all right and then
[8:34] he could be free to marry again only in
[8:37] the Lord
[8:38] it goes close to Mary in the Lord to
[8:41] start with and if if a wife her husband
[8:43] dies she's supposed to marry in the Lord
[8:46] not just anybody so it's supposed to be
[8:49] you know in a different situation so I
[8:52] and we've made those statements and come
[8:54] down to the point
[8:56] of trying to
[8:59] see something and it it just came up and
[9:01] when it did I want to make sure you
[9:03] understand something because I'll make
[9:07] this statement probably about I've got
[9:08] it written I know at least four times
[9:12] but you see we think about the grace of
[9:14] marriage and divorce and we won't cover
[9:16] that we're just going to mention it
[9:18] and we we say well boy it was something
[9:22] you know
[9:23] but do we understand
[9:25] do we really understand the grace of
[9:28] marriage and divorce
[9:29] and uh you know what happens and what
[9:32] took place and uh
[9:34] but here's my whole point
[9:38] there's a lot of people in this message
[9:40] probably that really was happy and
[9:42] joyous to receive the point that they
[9:46] believed when they heard the message
[9:48] that everything was okay if they had
[9:51] received the grace of marriage and
[9:52] divorce all right but then don't believe
[9:54] the rest of the message
[9:56] or even some other parts of the message
[9:58] or something you know now I'm going to
[10:01] that's my point is to try to drive home
[10:03] or point to us if we don't believe all
[10:06] the message
[10:08] then there is no Grace of marriage and
[10:10] divorce that's right
[10:12] all right if we don't believe the
[10:14] message and I don't mean we say well now
[10:16] so and so he believes the message well
[10:18] do they believe the message
[10:20] that you know do they believe the word
[10:23] well they're all here there well then
[10:25] how can they believe in the grace all
[10:27] right amen that is given because you
[10:30] can't accept one without accepting the
[10:33] other there's no way amen it can be done
[10:35] that's what I want to try to Anchor into
[10:37] each and every one of us as we'll read
[10:40] it in a minute where the Prophet said a
[10:42] supernatural Revelation because of the
[10:45] opening of The Seven Seals that he could
[10:48] speak the grace of marriage and divorce
[10:50] now not not just because he could come
[10:52] out and do it you know he he knew the
[10:54] scriptures and he knew Paul had done he
[10:56] knew about Moses and all that but he
[10:58] couldn't come out and say it until God
[11:00] revealed it to him you know to to speak
[11:03] it too now that'll be the point of what
[11:05] we're driving at
[11:06] all right and if I repeat it five or six
[11:09] times through the message I deliberately
[11:11] wrote it circled it put a star by it and
[11:13] said make sure you say this again again
[11:15] again again again again okay so we'll
[11:18] we'll get into that part of it but go
[11:20] ahead brother
[11:21] um Anderson and pull up what we're
[11:24] looking at
[11:26] and this is more or less the heart that
[11:29] people cause the grace of marriage and
[11:31] divorce now
[11:34] well I said I'll keep repeating this but
[11:37] do we believe this you know
[11:41] the or here but we don't believe this
[11:45] you know when I'm illustrating like
[11:47] another part of the message say we
[11:50] believe in the grace of marriage and
[11:51] divorce but we don't believe in the true
[11:54] Revelation one God when I have can you
[11:56] put that together in there and
[11:58] understand it you know how can it be
[12:01] because you know that's that's the point
[12:03] I want to drive home this morning
[12:06] you know of what what we're doing and I
[12:09] always put this on to make sure that
[12:10] people would understand what we're
[12:12] saying that we found out what a marriage
[12:14] was was because you asked the girl to
[12:18] marry you and she accepted
[12:21] that constitutes a marriage as far as
[12:23] God is concerned does not give you a
[12:25] right we got into the little discussion
[12:27] there Wednesday about that part and
[12:29] maybe some can help with other wordings
[12:32] of it but you know the uh the the the
[12:36] point came up about what we were doing
[12:38] but you know
[12:40] I I've done the best I can do to try to
[12:44] show you that if you're married you
[12:48] don't go live together
[12:50] until you go finish the wedding up with
[12:53] the altar you know the the things the
[12:56] prophet said ought to be in the church
[12:57] but if you're just married to the
[12:59] justice peace you're still married but
[13:01] in order to be another state or so and
[13:03] then going on to the climax of man and
[13:06] wife together
[13:08] and the question was saying well you
[13:10] know if you if you're married why can't
[13:14] you go ahead and live together and the
[13:16] best conclusion I can bring is that is
[13:19] we don't want to be in unclean living
[13:22] and see the world is looking at you and
[13:24] I that's nothing else
[13:26] that's right all right if nothing else
[13:28] the world is watching our lives every
[13:30] step we make
[13:31] you know every move we make the world is
[13:34] watching it well then we go out and live
[13:36] dirty before the world and they think
[13:37] well they don't care but we ain't that
[13:40] dirty we wait until we go to the altar
[13:43] we wait until we have the ceremony
[13:45] before we live together well that's the
[13:47] way it ought to be because the prophet
[13:49] said the first kiss or to be when you
[13:51] lift the Veil
[13:52] well then you go out and live together
[13:54] you know with husband and wife I figure
[13:56] you probably kiss some so you'd be
[13:58] messing up see so they'd be a lot of
[14:01] things you know other than natural but
[14:02] we just just in plain language we don't
[14:05] want to live un clean
[14:08] we want it to be to where that you know
[14:11] that we uh want to be right okay let's
[14:14] get into the message now today if you
[14:16] want to listen to the takes on Wednesday
[14:17] night they're there for you all right
[14:21] so from marriage and divorce paragraph
[14:24] three
[14:25] um seven through 307 through 313 we're
[14:29] going to read the whole thing and then
[14:31] we'll come back we talk about friends
[14:33] and we go what was revealed to me to
[14:35] tell you right now so don't don't miss
[14:37] it now I'm speaking to our follower only
[14:40] who is following me and this message
[14:44] not the outside by me record of this
[14:47] before God just to this group
[14:51] only
[14:53] all right so now the grace of marriage
[14:56] and divorce is not
[14:59] for anyone outside of the followers of
[15:02] this message amen that's right well
[15:04] that's people out there saying well you
[15:06] all really thank y'all something no is
[15:09] the following of the message we will
[15:10] cover this in a minute only the grace of
[15:14] God to Moses in the day that he spoke it
[15:17] was for the followers of Moses
[15:20] only for the day of Paul was it for the
[15:24] followers of Paul now a lot of people
[15:27] claim it
[15:29] but that goes back to the statement I
[15:31] made a moment ago we claimed the message
[15:34] we claim the grace and then deny the
[15:36] rest of the message
[15:38] oh we put our lives on the grace
[15:41] but then we won't put our lives on the
[15:43] rest of the message now where are we at
[15:45] so it's for the you know I'll repeat
[15:47] this over and over because I want you to
[15:49] get it right it's for just this group
[15:52] only now we're found in this mess
[15:54] because of misinterpreted theology is
[15:56] that right that's why you women married
[15:58] the second time and you men because
[15:59] misinterpreted theology all right now
[16:02] that's no excuse to say well we didn't
[16:05] know well that's well you know now okay
[16:09] so it's misinterpreted theology
[16:12] okay now I want to show you something
[16:14] that he told me
[16:16] if God our creator was questioned the
[16:18] question when he was here on the earth
[16:20] Jesus Christ and when his delivering
[16:21] Prophet came forth Moses now in Egypt to
[16:25] bring the children of Israel out of
[16:27] Egypt to put them in the promised land
[16:29] and Jesus said here that Moses seen the
[16:33] people in this condition and he granted
[16:36] them a writing a divorcement because the
[16:38] situation I watch it it was a situation
[16:41] with what it was Moses found such as let
[16:44] him suffer
[16:45] God permitted Moses that Prophet sent to
[16:48] the people to Grant this writing a
[16:50] divorcement to them and in First
[16:52] Corinthians the the seventh chapter in
[16:55] the 12th through the 15th verse in the
[16:57] New Testament Prophet Paul who meant the
[17:00] same thing in the church and spoke this
[17:02] is I not the Lord that right because of
[17:06] the divorce condition it wasn't so from
[17:08] the beginning but Moses was permitted it
[17:11] and God recognized it righteousness all
[17:14] right now what
[17:16] and Paul also had a right when he found
[17:19] his church in that condition
[17:21] now you believe this to be true and
[17:22] believe it to come from God
[17:24] and by the Vindication of his cloud and
[17:27] his message that's brought me thus far
[17:29] should not God upon the mountain permit
[17:32] me to do the same thing to suffer you to
[17:35] go on the way you are and do it no more
[17:37] go with your wives and live in peace for
[17:40] the hour is late the coming of the Lord
[17:42] is at hand I'm watching
[17:45] hours late the coming of the Lord is at
[17:48] hand
[17:49] I lose it when he goes up sometimes
[17:51] that's all right we haven't got time to
[17:53] break these things up don't you dare try
[17:55] to do it again I'm speaking only to my
[17:58] congregation but if you are married and
[18:00] God bore me witness of that on the
[18:02] mountain that I could say this a
[18:05] supernatural revelation
[18:07] because of the opening of The Seven
[18:10] Seals and this is a question in God's
[18:13] word let them go on in as they are and
[18:17] sin no more all right now
[18:20] as I said people accept that
[18:24] and put their life on that but what
[18:27] about the rest of the message
[18:28] right right I believe in Two Souls I
[18:31] Believe In This I Believe in Us huh go
[18:33] ahead that's uh
[18:35] that's between you and God it's not me
[18:37] all right so now let's get to point and
[18:40] drive it hard
[18:41] it's only to the followers of the
[18:44] message
[18:46] not for just anyone
[18:49] in the days of Moses it was only for the
[18:54] people that followed the word of the
[18:57] hour for the day that Moses was living
[19:00] all right
[19:02] now watch it in a minute because I got
[19:04] it wrote in here
[19:08] it was only for the followers of Paul in
[19:12] his day
[19:14] and it's only father followers of the
[19:17] end time word of this age
[19:21] all right
[19:22] now
[19:23] but I want you to pick up this point and
[19:25] I may repeat this a couple of times
[19:28] notice one thing
[19:31] the grace of Moses
[19:34] was counted righteousness
[19:37] in the days of Moses
[19:40] but it was not sufficient
[19:45] are you listening
[19:46] for the days of Paul
[19:50] are you listening now if it hadn't been
[19:53] how old would have quoted Moses right
[19:55] right amen see
[19:59] don't ask him keep going we'll get to
[20:01] that while this word then more words and
[20:03] more word and more words all right now
[20:06] so keep that in your mind now this the
[20:10] the Moses Grace was not sufficient for
[20:13] Paul right
[20:15] in his day it had to be revealed to Paul
[20:18] neither was it sufficient for the end
[20:21] time
[20:22] even though this Prophet could read that
[20:24] and did speak of it
[20:27] and said God has done things before you
[20:29] know in the conduct order in her
[20:30] Doctrine messages but he could not speak
[20:33] it until God spoke to him right amen see
[20:38] that's where we think well we'll just
[20:39] read the word
[20:41] what I've read in the word we're free by
[20:44] the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:48] that's wonderful
[20:49] but has it been revealed
[20:51] all right now
[20:53] now it's only for the age when it's
[20:54] spoken now put this in here because I
[20:57] try to cover every point to keep people
[20:58] from having questions and and questions
[21:01] then I know what it does because you'll
[21:03] be preaching along and the question will
[21:05] come up in your mind and you don't hear
[21:06] the rest of the message because the
[21:08] question is the only thing you've got in
[21:10] your mind and your brain just doesn't
[21:12] operate in the order of it does to sit
[21:15] there and hear things but it doesn't
[21:16] work correctly so now I want to put this
[21:19] in there
[21:22] in the days of Moses
[21:26] which what I said about this this Romans
[21:29] 7 about being under the law you know the
[21:32] picked it up Romans 7 verse 7.
[21:35] see in the days of Moses the people who
[21:39] heard the grace
[21:41] it didn't have to be that they were
[21:43] sitting in the building when Moses spoke
[21:45] it that's right all right
[21:50] it wasn't that they were sitting in the
[21:52] building now some were sitting in the
[21:53] building all right yes and I heard what
[21:56] he said or remember where they were
[21:58] gathered but you don't have to be that
[22:00] because see just like even the Apostle
[22:02] Paul
[22:04] the the Apostle Paul what he spoke was
[22:07] the word of God
[22:09] all right now we were not back there
[22:12] when he spoke it that's right
[22:16] but we read it just like Paul is
[22:18] speaking to us right amen all right you
[22:21] hear it so you've been anybody in the
[22:24] Old Testament realm could have believed
[22:27] the the message of Moses
[22:29] and the grace of Moses and could have
[22:32] accepted that
[22:33] right and God could reveal it to them
[22:35] amen all right
[22:38] now you following me till then when you
[22:40] would come to the days of Paul
[22:43] and Paul in that word of that hour
[22:46] he was a lot of people there when he
[22:48] said what he said and a lot of people's
[22:49] read what he said that's right all right
[22:51] but you didn't have to be sitting there
[22:53] to receive it that's right amen see
[22:55] everybody wasn't sitting at the
[22:57] Tabernacle when the prophet spoke the
[22:58] grace of marriage and divorce right amen
[23:00] right but he didn't say that this is
[23:03] only for the people sitting in the
[23:04] building today right that's right he
[23:06] said it's only for the followers of the
[23:08] message amen all right
[23:12] then being the followers of the message
[23:16] Moses Grace would have been sufficient
[23:19] for that age but not sufficient for the
[23:22] next age because more word was unveiled
[23:25] or unfolding and coming back all right
[23:28] so Mo Paul and his grace would have been
[23:30] sufficient for the day and the people
[23:33] coming down could look at that that he
[23:36] had spoken right all right and it would
[23:39] be fine if they could have comprehended
[23:41] which nobody really preached it you know
[23:44] I don't know of any commentators uh
[23:47] Schofield mentions a little bit about
[23:50] what Paul was doing and and all but they
[23:54] didn't understand the grace of marriage
[23:55] and divorce that's right but see if
[23:57] somebody if God could have revealed it
[23:59] God could have set them free that's
[24:01] right now follow me but then when it
[24:04] come down to this age and the prophet
[24:06] began to speak
[24:08] see more is going to be required that's
[24:10] right all right so more being required
[24:13] then it would take God sending a prophet
[24:16] and as I said not being like it was that
[24:19] Paul would say Moses said right so we
[24:23] believe Moses amen that's good
[24:27] but see God spoke to Moses to Paul
[24:30] like I've always tried to cover it with
[24:32] with Peter over in the scripture you
[24:34] know he said I was up on the mountain
[24:37] I went up there and saw the Lord Jesus
[24:39] all these things but he said I have a
[24:41] more sure word of Prophecy what he had
[24:44] an experience of the baptism of the Holy
[24:46] Ghost
[24:47] all right and see even Paul having the
[24:50] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[24:51] Ghost maybe he's seen some of the things
[24:54] Moses spoke of
[24:55] maybe he had an understanding of beloved
[24:58] but one day God came to him to speak to
[25:00] his people right all right now that
[25:03] would have lasted down to time you can
[25:06] argue maybe with me on that point but
[25:08] still I believe it would have lasted on
[25:10] down until this Prophet came
[25:14] all right now when this Prophet came on
[25:17] the scene then Moore was going to be
[25:19] required amen and he didn't come out in
[25:23] the in the 50s and preach marriage and
[25:25] divorce
[25:27] he said our Supernatural Revelation
[25:29] because of the opening of The Seven
[25:33] Seals All right now your father what I'm
[25:36] getting at see
[25:38] all then let's cover it just like this
[25:41] Moses gave a natural
[25:45] Grace for natural things right
[25:49] no problems
[25:52] married wrong you know done wrong all
[25:56] right his was a natural all right
[25:59] but when Paul came along Hall found the
[26:04] church in his day messed up you know and
[26:07] he was in the book of Corinthians which
[26:09] means correction and he had to correct a
[26:11] lot of things
[26:13] in there because like the women
[26:14] preachers used to be preachers down the
[26:16] prophet said under the old goddesses and
[26:18] the different things and they got
[26:19] converted and they thought well we just
[26:21] go ahead and preach here well see he had
[26:23] to straighten out all of those things
[26:24] and doing it all right but then he had
[26:27] to give a natural Grace
[26:32] to the people as Moses had to you know
[26:36] gifted or put into the hands of the
[26:38] people but Paul done more than that
[26:41] because see Paul took the natural
[26:47] and he began to type it with the
[26:49] spiritual
[26:52] all right so that's why it was covered
[26:54] in in Romans now that's that's what I
[26:57] mean see
[26:59] um we we determined the only place we
[27:01] could find in in Moses Grace was
[27:04] Deuteronomy 24. well that doesn't mean
[27:07] the rest of Moses message wasn't right
[27:09] that's right all right so you're right
[27:11] number three times for this so then when
[27:14] Paul came along just because it would be
[27:16] First Corinthians
[27:18] um you know there uh ever what we
[27:20] reached seven through what uh First
[27:23] Corinthians or seventh chapter 12
[27:25] through 15. oh we lay on that we believe
[27:28] that
[27:29] that's wonderful right
[27:31] but we don't know about this dress and
[27:33] hiring stuff and all that he said on
[27:35] over into here see all right see then
[27:38] look where you're getting to
[27:41] wait till we get this afternoon to see
[27:43] if that old husband is still alive
[27:46] that old husband is anything contrary to
[27:48] the word of God all right now but you
[27:51] get what my point of what I'm saying
[27:53] Hall brought it and Illustrated it right
[27:57] Joe then Romans 7
[28:01] is part of Paul's message right that's
[28:03] right
[28:04] I know I'm just making it naturally
[28:06] caramel because I want you to think
[28:08] about it see then all the writings of
[28:10] Paul was Paul's message
[28:12] that's right
[28:13] so you could say well I believe all the
[28:15] Paul's message but I don't believe this
[28:19] well if you don't believe all of it you
[28:21] couldn't come under the grace of
[28:22] marriage and divorce that's my point
[28:24] right
[28:25] you don't get nothing out of the message
[28:27] today we get no further that's the point
[28:29] okay
[28:31] that if we don't believe all that
[28:33] brother Brown broth then we can't
[28:35] believe part of what he brought
[28:38] it what kind of a Bible would you have
[28:40] that you can believe part of it to be
[28:42] true that's right what kind of a message
[28:43] would you claim to be part of it to be
[28:45] true well we know where brother Reynold
[28:47] made a mistake yeah I don't know where
[28:48] he corrected them too yeah right and if
[28:51] he didn't correct them I want to see
[28:52] your your brainy Revelation to where
[28:55] you've got to write corrected
[28:58] hmm all right now so let's get down to a
[29:01] part of what we get now
[29:03] see then Paul took it as a natural to
[29:07] explain it right all right you'll notice
[29:09] if I've asked you to read marriage and
[29:11] divorce run around before he got to the
[29:13] grace part he explained
[29:17] the reason of why
[29:19] the situation was like it was
[29:22] yes all right see so Paul's message
[29:24] explains the reason of the the the
[29:28] reason he had to give a Grace
[29:30] all right you see Moses was explaining
[29:34] you know the natural Paul was explaining
[29:36] the natural typing it with the spiritual
[29:40] and saying that we could be no more
[29:43] married you know and her husband had to
[29:44] be dead just like it would be in being
[29:47] married to Christ
[29:49] all right now
[29:51] so then that would be a natural and then
[29:54] you would take a natural and going
[29:56] towards spiritual
[29:58] okay brother Brown took a
[30:02] natural
[30:05] good expression unto us you know because
[30:07] it's what it was the natural things that
[30:08] had been done yes
[30:10] yes brought it into a spiritual
[30:12] condition
[30:15] see the show
[30:17] Christ in the church
[30:19] and is to take it back to a natural
[30:25] see this ain't got to go to a natural
[30:26] that's why I've always said if we can't
[30:28] be set free by the grace of marriage and
[30:30] divorce then these bodies can't go into
[30:32] Rapture amen I've always preached that
[30:34] to you you know that
[30:35] they can't be a Rapture of these bodies
[30:38] if they can't be straightened out in
[30:39] this world your brother said whatever we
[30:42] are here we go there we're the same
[30:44] thing there
[30:46] so you couldn't say Well they're getting
[30:47] straightened up over there
[30:51] got me straightened up here or there
[30:54] won't be a change in the body
[30:58] so how do you know about your old
[31:00] husband
[31:01] brother hantus made a good point years
[31:03] ago and he used to make the statements
[31:05] kind of funny but it was a good state
[31:07] and he said like this he said it's not
[31:10] how many wives I've had
[31:14] he said there's how many husbands I've
[31:16] had right and I thought well that's a
[31:19] good point now that many wives maybe
[31:21] might be clear at that point but how
[31:24] many husbands have we had you know we'll
[31:26] get more on that this afternoon all
[31:28] right but brother Brown took it see from
[31:31] a
[31:32] a natural right
[31:34] then he gets into the invisible Union
[31:37] right the reason I've asked you to read
[31:38] that
[31:40] and he covers it going back towards a
[31:43] spiritual condition and then takes us
[31:46] right into
[31:47] the Eternal Lands of the millennium
[31:50] fun
[31:52] see because that's where we're going
[31:54] that's that's where you know we're going
[31:55] to the change in the in the things that
[31:57] are going to take place all right so
[31:59] then I brought a quote that I thought
[32:00] would be interested upon this point so
[32:02] go ahead with number two the Third x is
[32:05] paragraph 299 on 1963 uh 6 30. morning
[32:10] service
[32:13] the first Exodus what did he do he
[32:16] brought them out of a natural land to a
[32:19] natural land now think of the marriage
[32:21] and divorce or what I just said this is
[32:23] the what I'm using it for see Paul Moses
[32:26] was natural
[32:29] he took him from a natural land of Egypt
[32:31] to a natural land of Goshen you know the
[32:35] the the people of God all right the
[32:38] second Exodus
[32:40] he brought them from a spiritual
[32:42] condition
[32:44] see which would you Jesus Christ coming
[32:47] to setting up a spiritual condition
[32:50] into a spiritual baptism of the Holy
[32:53] Ghost
[32:54] all right
[32:55] so that blows in with what Paul done
[32:58] said
[32:59] now he is bringing them from the
[33:02] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:05] right back into the Eternal land of the
[33:07] Millennium and the greaterafter same
[33:10] Throne of Fire same anointing system
[33:11] same God doing the same thing the same
[33:13] word declared the same one declared the
[33:15] second the same word declared the second
[33:17] has declared the third one and here we
[33:19] see it among us all right so now Paul
[33:23] Moses gave a natural to a natural
[33:27] he took him from an actual land to a
[33:29] natural land
[33:30] he gave him a natural Grace of Mary Jane
[33:32] doors
[33:34] all right when Jesus Christ came on the
[33:37] Saints he was picking it up into a
[33:38] spiritual condition that's why they
[33:40] couldn't understand him when he was
[33:41] preaching and he turned them to a
[33:43] spiritual baptism in the Holy Ghost all
[33:45] right now so then Paul is laying his
[33:48] grace in with the natural
[33:51] and then he types it with a spiritual
[33:55] see backwards and forth so it's tying
[33:57] together to what we're talking about but
[33:59] see in this end time we're going from a
[34:02] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:03] right into the land of the Millennium
[34:06] back to Natural so Greta Brown's message
[34:08] would be natural setting us free and
[34:10] natural flesh but then it would tie into
[34:13] the spiritual condition of being set
[34:16] free
[34:17] to be able to carry us into a natural
[34:20] land all right because I believe it
[34:23] I believe not only is the grace of
[34:25] marriage and divorce we've got to be
[34:26] given for the body the human elements
[34:29] the sin of life I believe that the the
[34:32] grace of marriage and divorce goes all
[34:34] the way into covering spiritual
[34:36] condition that our old husband and who
[34:38] we were married to
[34:40] and what's going on and how he could be
[34:42] dead right all right well that's what
[34:45] we're going to get into more this
[34:46] afternoon but you see what the point of
[34:48] trying to get now all right
[34:51] now take on it
[34:54] we will be talking about the grace of
[34:57] marriage divorce
[34:59] now I just wrote my right moment you
[35:01] know I write my own notes I like to read
[35:03] them sometimes they sound pretty good
[35:05] I helped Anna write a pieces one time in
[35:08] college and we got a ninth grade
[35:10] education I have to write a thesis and
[35:12] in the statement to make a statement
[35:13] we'd do something then we make a
[35:15] statement I'm going to hit an old
[35:16] Professor he circled everyone in
[35:17] statement he said well said good morning
[35:20] I went here I am I pray
[35:24] all right
[35:25] so I like to make statements like this
[35:27] are we talking about the grace of
[35:29] marriage and divorce
[35:33] is it not really the grace
[35:35] from marriage and divorce
[35:38] is that not really what it is
[35:40] the Grace from to get away from that's
[35:43] right because their marriage was wrong
[35:45] divorce is wrong
[35:47] so wouldn't it be like we come to
[35:48] America for freedom of religion but it's
[35:51] not that it's freedom from religion
[35:55] we come to America for freedom from
[35:57] religion because that was our problem
[35:58] over there was religion
[36:01] all right that sure is it with marriage
[36:03] and divorce now all right
[36:07] here I've got it written again to cover
[36:09] that part right
[36:12] if marriage and divorce Grace
[36:16] is it just a few words we've read
[36:19] or we could read the scriptures and we
[36:21] could cover the prophet you know and do
[36:23] the thing is that all we see
[36:27] about it
[36:30] how can I keep saying over and over how
[36:33] can we claim
[36:35] to accept the grace of marriage and
[36:38] divorce
[36:40] when we don't believe what the prophet
[36:42] said
[36:46] right
[36:47] now all the prophets Prophets
[36:50] say it we don't believe the Bible
[36:56] how can we claim now I didn't say it's
[36:59] been revealed to us no don't but if
[37:01] anything's made known then it's capable
[37:04] of being revealed you agree right all
[37:07] right see now then as we come into it is
[37:10] it just a few words of Grace American
[37:12] door or is it the whole message
[37:16] that's why you go out the people has
[37:18] taken this message of of marriage and
[37:21] divorce and tried to teach it to
[37:22] denominational people or something
[37:27] it comes along and says something about
[37:28] they got a marital problem
[37:30] why don't you come to our church we can
[37:31] straighten that out
[37:36] now that
[37:40] that's that's that's going the wrong way
[37:43] once you come to the truth
[37:46] see the truth
[37:48] like I've always said you you see people
[37:51] and I watched this over 40 something
[37:53] years now you see people that get mad
[37:55] about and come out of organized religion
[37:56] because they see that it's wrong you'll
[37:58] see them going back and organizing
[38:00] themselves or going back into another
[38:01] church okay but if you see them come out
[38:04] on the Revelation and one true and
[38:06] living God most of the time they'll stay
[38:08] because they've got a foundation they've
[38:10] got something anchored within them all
[38:12] right
[38:13] remember now
[38:17] in the days of Paul it was only for the
[38:21] Believers that followed Paul's message
[38:25] this was in the days of Moses was only
[38:27] for the ones who followed his message
[38:30] and preached that all right and now it's
[38:32] only for those who follow this end time
[38:35] prophet's message
[38:37] it's not for everybody that's right it's
[38:40] not for everybody that picks up a spoken
[38:42] word book and reads it that's right
[38:44] right
[38:45] there's people in this message that
[38:48] probably when brother Brown preached I'm
[38:50] just giving an illustration because
[38:51] there's there's a polygam in this
[38:53] message there's uh bigamies and
[38:55] hickamies and all kind of I guess you
[38:57] call it
[38:58] but there's people in this message
[39:00] that's probably got two or three wives
[39:03] but when they first started they
[39:04] probably grabbed the grace of marriage
[39:06] and divorce for trying to get away from
[39:07] what they had
[39:09] I did not something
[39:11] now that we can twist the message you
[39:13] make it all right but now watch
[39:16] it had to be revealed I want this
[39:19] anchored
[39:21] in the days of Moses it was not now
[39:24] we've anchored that I hope over and over
[39:26] and over that Moses never gave a Grace
[39:30] for just any cause
[39:35] see that was what Jesus wouldn't even
[39:37] talk to the Pharisees when and then when
[39:39] they was asking him about it he didn't
[39:41] even answer their blunt question he just
[39:43] bypassed it by saying it wasn't so from
[39:46] the beginning that was settled it
[39:48] Moses never gave a Grace for just
[39:50] anything
[39:54] you'd mess up everything in the word of
[39:56] God you'd make a prophet greater than
[39:57] God's word
[40:00] Paul never gave a Grace of marriage and
[40:02] divorce for just everybody for
[40:04] everything amen
[40:08] remember what I tried to show you that
[40:10] the grace of marriage and divorce
[40:11] applies for what is past right right
[40:17] don't try to apply it to what's future
[40:19] that's right that's Catholicism right
[40:23] live for what's passed it's what we've
[40:25] done that's right we get forgiveness of
[40:28] it yes right
[40:30] for what we've done the grace of
[40:32] marriage and divorce with what which for
[40:34] what people had done not for what they
[40:37] were going to do right right see they
[40:39] made it for any cause and that way they
[40:41] could just do anything they wanted to
[40:43] with it right and say Moses said
[40:47] I believe it
[40:49] I believe everything Moses says but this
[40:52] right here when he said this I just
[40:53] don't believe that
[40:56] oh
[40:57] is that the way it is in this message
[41:00] I believe everything brought around said
[41:01] itself
[41:06] now I say and you don't argue with me do
[41:08] what you want to ain't gonna argue with
[41:09] nobody about this making mistakes you
[41:11] forget it
[41:12] if we can't accept this message entirely
[41:16] then the grace of marriage and divorce
[41:18] cannot be accepted because it was not
[41:20] given in the early parts of the message
[41:21] it was given over into the ending up
[41:24] with the message
[41:27] if we can't get that right and that's
[41:28] the point I want to drive in for a while
[41:30] a supernatural Revelation that's right
[41:33] because of the opening of the seventh
[41:36] seeds
[41:37] you understand what he's saying yes
[41:40] yes do you understand that statement yes
[41:43] a supernatural Revelation because of the
[41:46] opening of the seventh seed
[41:49] in other words if the Seven Seals had
[41:51] never been broke they would have never
[41:51] been a supernatural revelation of
[41:53] marriage and divorce does that
[41:54] understood yes right you get it yeah yes
[41:57] if the seals had never been broken if
[41:59] the word of God had not been revealed to
[42:01] the prophet they would not been a Grace
[42:03] of marriage and divorce do you
[42:05] understand yes yes well how many people
[42:08] understands the seals
[42:12] when brother Ramos did marriage and
[42:13] divorce was revealed and sealed
[42:15] sir he said serpency was revealing a
[42:18] sealed separate seeds preacher 58. amen
[42:20] and yet he said it was revealed in the
[42:22] seal
[42:23] that thing was revealed in the seals
[42:25] because that's the old thing of the worm
[42:26] right
[42:27] he brought Iran's message now proved it
[42:29] over and over to you like in the Rapture
[42:31] message he said not in the beginning but
[42:32] when the when he begins to sound his his
[42:35] message runaround's message didn't begin
[42:37] until after this with the breaking of
[42:39] the seals is where the sick message
[42:40] begun
[42:42] the other was restoration back to what
[42:44] Paul and him had preached in the Bible
[42:45] that's right
[42:47] so you're following that point not going
[42:50] with it yes all right
[42:52] now
[42:53] here's what I want you to think about
[42:58] and we will be talking about the grace
[43:00] of marriage and divorce
[43:01] really the Grace from marriage and
[43:03] divorce
[43:06] but remember it's only for those who can
[43:10] accept the message
[43:13] of the age they were living in or we're
[43:15] living in now yes all right
[43:18] now and it is only for those the message
[43:22] has been revealed to
[43:25] to accepting the message is one point
[43:27] right
[43:29] said right around with the prophet one
[43:31] point
[43:33] but has it been revealed to it
[43:37] that's what we want to deal with right
[43:38] see it must be revealed to the people of
[43:40] the age
[43:41] and not to just be able to read what the
[43:44] prophet is saying
[43:46] right see why I said we want a few words
[43:49] of the grace you know
[43:53] but we don't want the rest of the
[43:55] message
[43:57] oh we we will fight you about the few
[44:00] words of Grace and God forgive me for
[44:03] saying a few words I'm just meaning that
[44:04] it was a uh about 50 pages of marriage
[44:09] and divorce and then he takes a half a
[44:10] page to explain
[44:12] the grace
[44:14] and what God spoke to him
[44:16] see it must be revealed to the people
[44:19] the age
[44:20] not to just quoted
[44:22] all right now the denominations
[44:26] read the Bible I don't mean that I mean
[44:28] all you know this message and everything
[44:30] I just put it all in one lump
[44:33] they read the Bible and say it's for
[44:36] them
[44:38] right
[44:42] but has it been revealed
[44:45] yes
[44:46] it's been revealed to us
[44:48] it's been revealed to me today Street
[44:50] College I can see it I I couldn't see
[44:54] that before but I can see it now it's
[44:55] been revealed to me
[44:57] well now did that come from God or the
[44:59] devil that's right that's right now you
[45:01] answered the part
[45:04] but get the the point of what I'm saying
[45:07] yes
[45:09] people read the Bible and say it's been
[45:12] revealed right
[45:15] heard a man one time he just come in the
[45:17] message and probably hadn't met him but
[45:19] just a I'm in a very short time and
[45:21] probably hadn't even read to see a book
[45:23] but he had heard the quote and he said
[45:25] boy ain't it something when them seals
[45:27] broke and the Bible become a brand new
[45:28] book
[45:32] that's easy to quote isn't it
[45:35] they become a brand new book thank you
[45:40] thank you
[45:42] but get that and it'll be better for
[45:44] this afternoon about the old husband all
[45:46] right we read the message we claim the
[45:49] message to be true but has it been
[45:51] revealed to us
[45:55] I believe the grace of God has to be
[45:58] revealed whether it be for our uh you
[46:02] know a new birth
[46:06] see or whether it be for marriage and
[46:09] divorce
[46:14] see grace is unmerited favor we lay a
[46:17] lot on that point but then we think
[46:18] about it as Grace being the point that
[46:20] God has revealed
[46:22] right you remember running around
[46:23] talking about it with white Moody that
[46:25] read Romans 7 and when I run out in the
[46:28] streets you know him first man he come
[46:29] to me he said do you know Grace and then
[46:31] I said Grace who he said the grace of
[46:33] God that set him free he's seen it by
[46:36] Revelation about the grace of God
[46:37] setting him free right have you seen it
[46:40] about the grace of God setting you free
[46:41] from your old sins
[46:47] okay
[46:49] or is that just a quote
[46:52] see grace is actually the revelation of
[46:55] God's word which is his will that's
[46:57] right
[46:58] and Willis's word
[47:02] that he has extended to us
[47:07] no matter what we're asking about you
[47:10] know healing sounds wonders whatever uh
[47:13] Revelation you know it's revealed to us
[47:16] that's right
[47:19] it's mine
[47:21] it belongs to me all right
[47:25] see the reveal word now not just the
[47:27] letter
[47:31] but Paul said to let her kill it that's
[47:33] right
[47:35] and like I've always tried to explain to
[47:37] you that people say well you know pour
[47:39] over the bad news this way they preach
[47:40] poor old Nicodemus
[47:46] must be born again and
[47:48] poor Nicodemus couldn't understand that
[47:52] I only had two good one Lord Jesus
[47:53] Christ
[47:55] your body
[47:58] you know that's what that's why the
[48:00] priest is just you know saying that
[48:02] Nicodemus he just couldn't understand
[48:06] well all you got to do is believe
[48:08] when Nicodemus believe put his life on
[48:10] the line
[48:11] his job was on the line they caught him
[48:13] out there where he's at it
[48:14] black ball out right right
[48:18] but you see we just say well I please
[48:20] the message
[48:22] but has it been revealed to you
[48:26] that's right
[48:28] you know what's the point
[48:30] we won't have to pull this back up but
[48:32] down at the end of the the message that
[48:36] we gave you on we pulled up where the
[48:38] Prophet was talking about
[48:40] and he said
[48:42] a supernatural revelation
[48:47] because of the opening of The Seven
[48:48] Seals
[48:51] I can say this he said
[48:54] now
[48:56] what does that mean to you a
[48:58] supernatural revelation
[49:03] I mean I don't want a definition of
[49:04] Supernaturals and Revelation now I'm
[49:07] asking what it means to you
[49:09] right I I kind of read you know
[49:12] I want to know what it means to you
[49:17] is this Supernatural Revelation that was
[49:20] given to the prophet
[49:22] was it something that was
[49:25] not in the word
[49:33] are you listening
[49:37] was it something that's not in the word
[49:45] or was it in the word but light had not
[49:48] shined on it
[49:52] come on we know it wasn't revealed to
[49:54] man right down through there
[49:56] delighted not shiny remember the the
[49:58] pyramid Mountain the prophet Top Cut Off
[50:01] looks down in sees the thing come back
[50:03] preachers to see open on
[50:06] and they said run around and said well
[50:07] your ability you said you could write on
[50:09] what is the 23rd chapter of Revelation
[50:10] or something like that he said see there
[50:13] they were trying to trap me right
[50:15] he said coach you can't add one word
[50:17] that's right
[50:19] well the supernatural Revelation the
[50:21] prophet received he said was because of
[50:25] the opening of the seventh seals
[50:31] something was revealed to him because
[50:33] the sealed had been broke yes
[50:39] but it couldn't be nothing contrary
[50:43] a different message or whatever you know
[50:45] that's right
[50:47] so when the prophet came along this
[50:49] message started with the opening of the
[50:50] seal tonight was that a different
[50:52] message from what all the other was no
[50:54] no
[50:57] sure it was we'll get to it in a minute
[50:59] it was the Capstone the finality the
[51:01] Finish yes true
[51:04] but the prophet said you can't add one
[51:06] word amen to the Bible he said it was
[51:10] the things that was in the Bible
[51:13] all right so the grace of marriage and
[51:15] divorce was in the Bible so the prophet
[51:18] and being a prophet and you go back and
[51:20] conduct order and Doctrine in 64 there
[51:22] before the marriage and divorce and
[51:25] you'll hear him saying that things go on
[51:27] as you are right here don't do nothing
[51:29] until you hear from me
[51:31] we read them the other day yes
[51:34] said to eat something yes he knew
[51:38] something would happen but he couldn't
[51:40] just go out and speak it that's right
[51:43] let's go and God revealed it to me I'll
[51:45] just go speaking you know
[51:47] you you got a problem that's right go
[51:51] ahead
[51:52] dude you get things premature and then
[51:55] you speak a little bit about what he's
[51:56] saying and the rest of it he's a blabber
[51:58] of our mouths that's right
[52:02] all right
[52:04] so my point is what
[52:06] a supernatural Revelation because of the
[52:08] opening of the seventh seal the Seven
[52:09] Seals couldn't add anything to the Bible
[52:12] so then the supernatural revelation of
[52:14] marriage and divorce could not be
[52:15] something added to the Bible
[52:19] it would have to be what the Bible was
[52:21] speaking of right
[52:24] right but no man had seen it like that
[52:26] that's right
[52:28] and was able to speak it all right
[52:34] so then the Sea of had to be opened
[52:36] before marriage and divorce could be
[52:37] preached right
[52:40] see it was in the word but not revealed
[52:44] yes
[52:46] hmm
[52:47] until God opened the word and brought us
[52:50] the entire Bible
[52:52] then it could be done all right
[52:55] now Supernatural revelation
[53:01] what do you think he's talking about
[53:06] well it's this this it was this great
[53:09] Revelation that he got
[53:10] could it be contrary to the word
[53:15] could in any way this Prophet had his
[53:17] talks to the word
[53:19] if he did then he messed it up right so
[53:23] it had to be written had to be what was
[53:24] written in the word amen so you can't
[53:27] add to the word is that true so it must
[53:30] be what was written in or type
[53:34] that's right in the word of God but not
[53:37] made alive to us and the reason I say
[53:40] written type see was written in the or
[53:45] type in the word see there was a lot of
[53:47] types and shadows back there that were
[53:49] not clear enough to work that you could
[53:51] read it as thinking it was the word
[53:53] right
[53:54] you know what I'm saying the letter
[53:56] right so it would be a type this
[54:00] yes they would speak or something
[54:03] all right
[54:04] David in his marriage of
[54:08] you know where Solomon won with a
[54:10] thousand wives was a type that's right o
[54:13] Christ in the church
[54:15] all right so it would be part of the
[54:18] word but yet not the word because it was
[54:20] not so from the beginning and never was
[54:22] supposed to been that way that's right
[54:24] so a type can be in there that you can
[54:27] see it
[54:28] but a top is always something that's
[54:30] like a canoe is a type of a big ocean
[54:32] liner boats you know a ship thing yes
[54:34] and you know so you have to be careful
[54:36] the way you type
[54:38] um you know brother Al that time we was
[54:40] down in Atlanta and this brother typed
[54:42] the road he lived on and the way he come
[54:43] to church and where he done this and
[54:45] where he done that and they all looked
[54:47] the back of his car and said what on the
[54:48] top is tag number his tag number was
[54:51] 666. and you know
[54:56] all right let's see if we can talk and I
[54:59] know one brother I heard as a matter of
[55:01] fact I believe it was the same one but
[55:02] anyhow they were typing one time and
[55:04] they was talking about median I want to
[55:07] see which one's the last one meeting
[55:09] um right around his wife maybe they
[55:11] typed it back there and they said at
[55:12] that time she was still living so she
[55:14] there said me you'll never die
[55:19] well she did
[55:21] was that one right
[55:24] but now God's types ain't that way
[55:26] that's right God typed through his types
[55:29] are right that's right amen you know
[55:31] they're speaking or something
[55:33] that will finality come into being all
[55:36] right now
[55:40] a supernatural revelation
[55:45] is the word of God Made Alive to you
[55:47] amen
[55:52] so what was it to the prophet
[55:55] the word Was Made Alive
[55:59] and then God could you speak through the
[56:01] conscience of a man
[56:03] and say see what Paul Moses done
[56:06] see what Paul done
[56:08] right you go tell them to go on now was
[56:12] that brother Branham or was that God
[56:14] speaking which one is it
[56:18] we know the man's voice was used we know
[56:20] the lips was used we know all of those
[56:23] things
[56:23] but was that God would Paul when he was
[56:27] saying uh not I but the Lord and the
[56:30] Lord not the Lord but I you know was he
[56:32] taking all that power on his control or
[56:35] what was he
[56:36] now I want to show you more this
[56:38] afternoon on it but I want you to think
[56:40] about it
[56:43] did Moses on the grace of marriage and
[56:46] divorce did he have as the mind of
[56:48] Christ
[56:50] as always can speak it right right
[56:54] so he run around a whole lot more than
[56:55] what you think about him as he's saying
[56:57] well Moses was the type of Christ when
[56:59] he said I'll stand in the way
[57:02] don't you think that was Christ and
[57:04] Moses that was speaking to Grace for
[57:06] those people
[57:07] don't you think it was Christ in Paul
[57:12] that could say more than Moses because
[57:16] Paul was a borned against Christian
[57:20] and a prophet to the age of church-aged
[57:23] messenger Etc
[57:25] and he had the mind of Christ how much
[57:29] more sure would the grace that Paul
[57:31] spoke be more than what Moses spoke
[57:36] people tied together into the spiritual
[57:38] all right what about this end time
[57:40] prophet
[57:42] it was not only a prophet he was a
[57:45] church age messenger he was a born-again
[57:47] Believer surely we know he had to mind
[57:49] the Christ he was adopted manifested son
[57:51] of God and had the caption of Revelation
[57:53] amen
[57:55] how much more will God keep his word in
[57:57] the end times we can believe it and
[57:59] understand what a supernatural
[58:00] Revelation is right right all right
[58:03] let's get a couple of quotes on
[58:04] something before we get too far okay go
[58:06] ahead brother pull up number three
[58:10] this is taken from the message super
[58:12] sign uh 61-40 30.
[58:15] paragraph e

[1:03:34] the denomination is claimed to believe
[1:03:37] the Bible amen
[1:03:40] they said I got a supernatural
[1:03:42] Revelation there's got to be three Gods
[1:03:44] people even says and I get to Heaven
[1:03:46] Ain't three so I'll turn around and
[1:03:47] leave across the wrong place
[1:03:52] see that's how
[1:03:54] arrogant and things we become now we're
[1:03:56] going to get to that this afternoon
[1:03:59] and see if the old husband is dead
[1:04:04] amen you see if a dumb donkey
[1:04:06] live on a preacher
[1:04:09] a dumb donkey corrected a man one time a
[1:04:11] prophet right that's right amen now the
[1:04:14] dumb donkey speaks to you
[1:04:18] and you deny that
[1:04:20] and won't accept it
[1:04:22] then your old husband's Not Dead
[1:04:26] that's the reason you accept it that way
[1:04:28] we'll get to that this afternoon amen
[1:04:30] but I just wanted you to see
[1:04:33] Kane had a supernatural revelation
[1:04:37] of a supernatural God
[1:04:40] who had a supernatural word
[1:04:44] and when he revealed that to you it's
[1:04:46] your revelation
[1:04:51] he called all Revelation is Supernatural
[1:04:54] in all Revelation is the grace of God
[1:05:00] amen you agree
[1:05:02] the grace of God extended down to you
[1:05:06] and I am
[1:05:08] no matter if it's one little words
[1:05:10] you've received
[1:05:12] that's wonderful
[1:05:16] that's great
[1:05:17] Brother Gary and I don't talk another
[1:05:19] day about it if the Lord shows you
[1:05:21] something
[1:05:22] just stay there I'm trying to figure it
[1:05:24] out you mess it up just stay right in
[1:05:27] that realm and study and pray in that
[1:05:28] rim you know and just wait for the Lord
[1:05:31] to lead you out a little further that's
[1:05:32] right but thank God he's already gave
[1:05:35] you something
[1:05:36] yeah I mean
[1:05:37] because you gotta admit that you didn't
[1:05:39] have this prior to then so if he give
[1:05:43] you something to get you started though
[1:05:44] stay right time
[1:05:51] I wouldn't preach on things
[1:05:53] for many many years and I can give you a
[1:05:55] quote for everything in it you know
[1:05:57] there are quotes I used later was the
[1:05:58] very quotes but still it was not
[1:06:00] revealed
[1:06:04] when I speak to you you better believe
[1:06:06] one thing it's been revealed to me
[1:06:09] if it ain't I'll tell you in a hurry no
[1:06:11] problem
[1:06:14] see because it's a supernatural
[1:06:16] revelation
[1:06:19] but this Supernatural Revelation now
[1:06:22] listen listen to me for a few minutes
[1:06:26] see Paul will have Supernatural
[1:06:28] Revelation right Peter James John them
[1:06:30] to writings of the Bible they wrote what
[1:06:32] God told him what it was right but they
[1:06:36] didn't understand the Seven Seals
[1:06:39] that even John the writer didn't
[1:06:41] understand
[1:06:43] see because there was something to be
[1:06:45] revealed in the end time amen right
[1:06:48] right and it would take then a prophet
[1:06:52] not another Paul that was wonderful
[1:06:55] Paul understands that when I say that
[1:06:58] and I'm not derogatory to it but he was
[1:07:01] a PO he was a prophet only through the
[1:07:03] file for Ministry forms and set aside
[1:07:06] for his day of that you know Apostle
[1:07:08] Prophet Evans and the church age
[1:07:09] mentioned everything
[1:07:10] but this Prophet was greater than all
[1:07:12] that's right he was greater than all the
[1:07:16] prophets
[1:07:17] is that the way he said
[1:07:19] that you've been given more gifts
[1:07:22] in any of the prophets
[1:07:25] only the Lord Jesus could stand and say
[1:07:27] the things this Prophet the end time
[1:07:29] would say when he say bring me 24 of
[1:07:31] your worst cases and I'll guarantee you
[1:07:33] healing for every one of them
[1:07:37] that's his work
[1:07:42] but he wasn't gone
[1:07:45] so when God used a man's lips to speak
[1:07:48] his grace to you and I we thank God
[1:07:52] did the prophet say say thank you to no
[1:07:56] man that's right that's right now he
[1:07:59] didn't mean don't pat him on the back
[1:08:00] and don't say thank you that was a good
[1:08:02] message I enjoyed it you know
[1:08:06] come on put it all together
[1:08:09] we're the man on the on the train you
[1:08:11] know riding he said I saved God's money
[1:08:14] took a chair in other words you know
[1:08:16] just a regular old seat bench or what
[1:08:18] you call it
[1:08:19] he said
[1:08:20] I took a birth back there a bed and
[1:08:22] saved God's man
[1:08:25] well you don't believe in God
[1:08:28] no he's just honest
[1:08:30] he got a good nice rash thank God for
[1:08:33] the ranch
[1:08:35] you understand what I'm saying a
[1:08:36] supernatural revelation
[1:08:41] see if anything been revealed to you I
[1:08:44] keep saying that over and over and over
[1:08:45] anything to be revealed to hear me
[1:08:47] either one that's Supernatural
[1:08:52] um
[1:08:53] wow we know it comes our way of the
[1:08:55] Prophet that's right right
[1:08:59] we believe in that right it come by way
[1:09:01] of the Prophet amen we don't claim
[1:09:04] nothing didn't come you know it was on
[1:09:06] its own
[1:09:10] but to show you something that'll tell
[1:09:11] you this afternoon I heard about a man
[1:09:13] the other day that
[1:09:14] quit a church and
[1:09:16] when he was contacted about it he said
[1:09:18] well this ain't none of y'all can
[1:09:19] explain it
[1:09:22] the brother asked him said what do you
[1:09:23] believe brother Brown could explain he
[1:09:25] said no
[1:09:27] that he couldn't explain
[1:09:30] he asked him said well do you
[1:09:33] do you believe that you've gone beyond
[1:09:35] brother Brown the man said yes I have
[1:09:38] see that's how much a husband can take
[1:09:40] you and Lead You Off the word
[1:09:42] amen an old denominational idea a
[1:09:45] husband or a thought
[1:09:49] you saw can't happen to me
[1:09:52] as a lot of people said that right
[1:09:57] would you ever thought that Oral Roberts
[1:10:00] Pentecostal man would have ever stepped
[1:10:03] down and become a Methodist evangelist
[1:10:06] thank you
[1:10:12] I'm not throwing off on here man I do
[1:10:14] need it to me and you
[1:10:15] you know what I'm talking about you see
[1:10:17] a lot of people in this message they
[1:10:19] swore by this message but when 77 come
[1:10:22] around they left the message
[1:10:25] any little thing it took just to lead
[1:10:27] them away
[1:10:28] and fall away from the message
[1:10:32] when they would one day fight you over
[1:10:34] the fact that they believed everything
[1:10:35] the prophet said
[1:10:41] have we got a supernatural revelation
[1:10:46] like
[1:10:48] I told you about that brother that time
[1:10:49] when I was preaching you know on the
[1:10:51] field and I said this is my revelation
[1:10:54] the brother sent me words said brother
[1:10:56] Brown's y'all want to have the
[1:10:57] revelation
[1:10:59] he said my Revelation is that brother
[1:11:01] Branham had your revelation
[1:11:03] I never sent the word back to him or
[1:11:05] nothing never said nothing
[1:11:07] because I'd like for you to explain what
[1:11:10] he said
[1:11:11] I said I had a revelation let's see if
[1:11:13] my Revelation is correct
[1:11:15] if it feels like the prophet said it's
[1:11:17] all right he said he had a revelation
[1:11:20] Libra Brown had a real life
[1:11:23] you don't understand
[1:11:26] he was saying I was wrong for saying I
[1:11:28] had a revelation he said he had a
[1:11:29] revelation I said I had a revelation his
[1:11:32] Revelation wrote around his own one had
[1:11:34] a revelation
[1:11:37] but see the man was real quick to want
[1:11:39] the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:11:42] maybe for something he needed
[1:11:45] or whatever
[1:11:49] you understand my point
[1:11:52] because of the opening of the entire
[1:11:55] Bible to the prophet
[1:11:58] God could speak to him
[1:12:01] about Moses his grace and Paul's Grace
[1:12:06] and then he could speak and give a Grace
[1:12:08] to You and I
[1:12:11] now as I said in the message partner I
[1:12:13] believe it I believe we need the grace
[1:12:15] of marriage and divorce on a spiritual
[1:12:17] condition
[1:12:18] more than we do in a natural that's
[1:12:20] right because you may not be guilty of a
[1:12:23] natural condition right
[1:12:27] but we're all guilty of a spiritual
[1:12:29] condition that's right we've all had the
[1:12:32] wrong husband
[1:12:34] and to be married to Christ without that
[1:12:36] husband being dead that denomination
[1:12:38] that idea then we're an adulterish
[1:12:43] read invisible Union and say we will
[1:12:46] read most of it this afternoon
[1:12:49] but thank all these things come on
[1:12:51] musician think on these things
[1:12:55] well only the prophet had Supernatural
[1:12:57] revelation
[1:13:13] you see we take those things and we say
[1:13:15] well I believe so much of the message
[1:13:19] I believe this
[1:13:20] now how can we claim the grace
[1:13:23] of marriage and divorce if we don't
[1:13:25] believe
[1:13:27] everything that the man brought to us
[1:13:30] and you know what I mean by that
[1:13:33] when he was preaching the white horse
[1:13:35] rider was the Holy Ghost he was wrong
[1:13:39] but he corrected it
[1:13:43] right he correct that's right nobody
[1:13:46] else corrected him
[1:13:48] God correctly
[1:13:54] how are we free
[1:13:57] if we've been married two or three times
[1:14:01] about what thing can God do this is for
[1:14:04] the afternoon
[1:14:05] what can he do
[1:14:07] to make us free
[1:14:11] they did not break the word
[1:14:15] what can that part be quiet brother what
[1:14:17] do we got
[1:14:18] let's stay
[1:14:23] 372.
[1:14:24] 372 Inspire book anybody have a knee
[1:14:29] you asked me why I'm happy
[1:14:47] okay
[1:15:10] foreign
[1:16:35] foreign

[1:17:34] he's a liar right
[1:17:37] he's a bluff
[1:17:39] they'll just call this Bluff
[1:17:42] thank you you know I have to do that a
[1:17:44] long time that's called his bluff and he
[1:17:45] tells me so you're lost I said well okay
[1:17:47] that makes two others lost
[1:17:50] so I mean you both off
[1:17:54] now what we're gonna do
[1:17:56] well he just gets away and it finally
[1:17:58] gets a blazes ah he's just crazy well
[1:18:01] maybe I am
[1:18:04] and I certainly love the Lord certainly
[1:18:06] believe his word amen amen don't you

[1:18:12] revelation

[1:18:19] word of God whether it be serpent seed
[1:18:22] one God no eternal hell whatever be
[1:18:25] revealed to you that is Supernatural

[1:18:36] only the prophet had a supernatural
[1:18:37] revelation It's Supernatural Revelation

[1:18:42] many many many many many many many
[1:18:44] Supernatural Revelations of God coming
[1:18:46] forward
[1:18:47] and then it was brought into a
[1:18:50] place to say I say
