[0:00] uh
[0:00] one is that i was i was listening some
[0:02] brother that was here two years ago i
[0:04] don't know him i never met him but i was
[0:06] looking up on the website and um i was
[0:08] listening to one of his sermons
[0:10] and he was saying um
[0:12] he said you know we can look at each
[0:14] other but
[0:15] and we can say wow you know that that's
[0:16] a great christian but you know you never
[0:18] know what somebody had to go through to
[0:20] get there
[0:21] so um i just want to always remember
[0:24] we don't know each other's journey but
[0:27] we probably all been through a lot to
[0:29] get to where you at right now
[0:30] um the second thing is
[0:33] one of my customers gave me
[0:35] a pair of slippers some really nice
[0:37] slippers and
[0:39] they wasn't my size i tried to stuff my
[0:41] foot in there but they you know it
[0:42] didn't work for me so i held on to him
[0:44] and i had him in my um in my trunk so
[0:47] i came to church sunday
[0:49] and i forgot about him
[0:51] but after i came back outside i was like
[0:52] well i wonder who i can give him to i
[0:53] was trying to think like who was small
[0:55] enough who can fit into him so i figured
[0:56] i'd play cinderella or something you
[0:58] know
[0:59] so um
[1:00] anyway so i just said well maybe i'll
[1:02] maybe i'll do it next time i come back
[1:03] i'll just leave them out and put a free
[1:05] sun on or something so uh
[1:07] the other night i ended up going to the
[1:09] store to grab something right quick and
[1:11] i only brought like a couple dollars
[1:12] with me um
[1:14] so when i got in there i seen a young
[1:17] lady that lives in my neighborhood that
[1:19] she usually walks around i see her every
[1:21] now and then i don't know her but i see
[1:22] her every now and then and i've spoke to
[1:24] her before so anyway this particular
[1:26] night she ended up coming in there
[1:28] and
[1:29] i was in my car trying to find some
[1:31] change because i didn't i needed 50 more
[1:32] cents to get something i was trying to
[1:34] get so i went back inside and i didn't
[1:36] have enough
[1:37] and uh she saw me talking to the cash
[1:38] bridge registered ladies so she was like
[1:40] well how much more do you need i said
[1:41] well 50 50 cents so she gave it to me i
[1:43] was like thank you so much that's so
[1:44] sweet
[1:45] so um she was like well can you give me
[1:48] a ride back home it was at night she's
[1:49] like well can you give me a ride back
[1:50] home i was like okay so
[1:52] she um she was still in the store and i
[1:54] went back out to my um vehicle and just
[1:56] waited on her so
[1:58] uh she she had sandals on so when she
[2:00] came back out she was like you know my
[2:01] feet are so cold you know i wasn't even
[2:03] thinking about the slippers it's like my
[2:05] feet are so cold you know so
[2:06] i took her where she wanted to go and we
[2:08] had to kind of like sit in the car to
[2:10] wait on the person she was waiting on
[2:11] for a minute so
[2:13] um
[2:14] my mom thought about the slippers but i
[2:16] was like well she don't like she can fit

[11:57] in jesus name amen
[12:00] while we are standing let's open the
[12:02] word of the lord
[12:05] in matthew chapter 21 and it's a very
[12:07] familiar scripture from the message what
[12:10] is the attraction on the mountain
[12:12] matthew 21 verse 1
[12:19] and it says and when they drew nigh unto
[12:21] jerusalem and were come to beth page
[12:25] unto the mount of olives then sent jesus
[12:27] to disciples
[12:29] saying unto them go into the village
[12:32] over against you and straight away you
[12:33] shall find an ass
[12:35] a donkey let me say call it a donkey
[12:37] tight and they cold
[12:39] with her lose them and bring them unto
[12:41] me
[12:42] and if any man say unto you
[12:46] you shall say the lord has need of them
[12:49] and straight away he will send them
[12:51] all this was done that he might be
[12:53] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[12:55] prophet saying
[12:57] tell you the daughter of sign behold thy
[12:59] king
[13:01] cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon a
[13:04] donkey and they called the foal of an
[13:06] donkey
[13:07] and the disciples went and did as jesus
[13:09] commanded them and brought the donkey
[13:12] and the cold and put on them their
[13:14] clothes and they set him thereon
[13:16] and a very great multitude spread their
[13:18] garments in the way others cut down
[13:21] branches from the trees straw them in
[13:23] the way in the multiple multitudes
[13:26] that went before and followed christ
[13:27] saying hosanna to the son of david
[13:30] blessed is he
[13:32] that cometh in the name of the lord
[13:34] hosanna in the highest
[13:36] and he was come into jerusalem all the
[13:38] city was moved saying who is this
[13:42] may the lord add his blessing to the
[13:44] reading of his word
[13:46] and we may be seated i i put up the
[13:49] jacket brother i think that is not a
[13:51] problem for you

[13:55] lord jesus christ

[14:03] joy for me to be here

[14:13] this evening but if i'm here i was
[14:15] landing right maybe two hours ago or
[14:18] maximum three hours in atlanta and i
[14:19] said if i'm in the area i would come by
[14:22] and just shake your hands i'm already
[14:24] blessed
[14:24] uh paul said when i saw the brothers
[14:27] from rome i was already strengthened and
[14:29] fortified just by seeing them
[14:31] and and it's a great honor for me and i
[14:34] love very much brother dale our most
[14:36] noble elders and pastor but the day may
[14:39] god keep you and hold you

[14:45] brother wade and
[14:47] thanks for your friendship and may god
[14:48] richly the best all of you and
[14:51] i would sleep the night in brother
[14:52] louise and when i was here
[14:54] first time years ago
[14:56] dad brother lewis was newly coming to
[14:59] the church
[15:00] and and i saw how he's growing
[15:03] he's growing uh in his stature of a man
[15:06] he
[15:07] he's not a teenager anymore he's a real
[15:09] man
[15:10] uh no he is he is you know and he is uh
[15:14] he's growing spiritually you know you
[15:15] talk with him
[15:17] he seems to be under very good care you
[15:19] know in intensive care somehow you know
[15:21] because he's growing so fast
[15:23] and uh
[15:24] but uh so my compliments to the to the
[15:27] pastor and to the ministers here because
[15:29] he seemed to have a very good
[15:31] development it's a pleasure to see you
[15:33] know and so it's a compliment back to
[15:35] you so may god richly continue to bless
[15:37] you and uh yes i'm on my way for for
[15:41] different meetings and services we have
[15:43] a little project but i will not enter
[15:45] into this and uh if it's fine for you i
[15:47] know it's a wednesday i'm directly
[15:48] entering into the word of the lord is
[15:50] that fine not to i'm normally not a long
[15:53] preacher this evening neither i come
[15:55] directly to my point and i don't know if
[15:58] i was even preaching that uh uh
[16:00] once i was preaching twice here but
[16:02] doesn't matter i had three subjects
[16:05] really
[16:06] all the flights go into the notes and to
[16:09] different things and and sweet subject
[16:11] and now it was up prominent for me to
[16:14] preach about that subject if it's the
[16:16] little refreshment that i was preaching
[16:18] the same thing that it's fine uh
[16:20] accounted just to my age once you are
[16:22] past 50
[16:24] you're becoming more uh wise but older
[16:29] that's fine and uh yeah
[16:31] and i i have a right one thing to say
[16:34] please don't take what i say but what i
[16:36] want to say okay
[16:38] i uh brother louise know i'm speaking a
[16:40] little bit of spanish and uh but i'm not
[16:43] i'm not preaching in spanish because i
[16:46] told the brother said if i will preach
[16:47] in spanish you will have a split in the
[16:49] church just because of my grammar
[16:52] so so even my english but if you so if
[16:55] you want to understand me you can get it
[16:57] and uh
[16:58] i would like to bring us into that
[17:00] picture okay i would i would i i would i
[17:03] would like to talk about us okay not
[17:05] about only you but about us
[17:07] because this message
[17:09] changed the bible
[17:11] the pages are the same but brother
[17:13] abraham said the bible became a new book
[17:16] and and i think i i have a right to say
[17:19] this uh uh no matter for where i come
[17:22] from but the message that we believe
[17:24] does not come from america
[17:27] it comes from the presence of almighty
[17:30] this is what the angel told brother
[17:31] branham
[17:32] i'm sent from the presence of almighty
[17:34] this message does not come from from
[17:37] from indiana
[17:38] it comes from god amen
[17:40] and it's for god's children
[17:42] and this message gave us our identity
[17:46] nobody could explain who we were
[17:48] but only the one who created us could
[17:50] explain us
[17:52] and and and there were many mysteries
[17:54] that were revealed over over many
[17:56] thousand years but this is the time
[17:59] when god says the mystery of god not
[18:02] mysteries
[18:03] scofield saw already some mysteries
[18:06] but this is the mystery
[18:09] which is revealed and nobody could
[18:11] reveal it but only the messenger for
[18:12] this age and brother bryan preaches
[18:14] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[18:16] maybe there is different interpretations
[18:19] and we know uh
[18:20] scriptures have compound meaning but for
[18:23] me it's it's it's to say
[18:25] that god has a family
[18:28] god has a power god god has not only let
[18:31] me say disciples
[18:33] but god has a bride
[18:35] and this bride is part of christ
[18:38] this part is this this bride is is part
[18:42] of him
[18:43] as eve was part of adam the brightest is
[18:46] part of christ
[18:47] so we talk not only about people who are
[18:50] just believing the message
[18:53] uh getting saved but we are talking to
[18:56] people who got saved they got the
[18:59] baptism of the holy ghost but now they
[19:01] are entering into adoption
[19:04] now into a position because this is a
[19:06] rapturing time
[19:08] and and the rapture in time needs
[19:10] rapturing faith
[19:11] and rapturing faith comes by the word
[19:13] for this age
[19:16] therefore these seals have to be opened
[19:17] and brother branham says god took the
[19:19] seals from christ and then he says he he
[19:22] took the seals from us
[19:24] this showed who we were in the mind of
[19:26] god amen amen blessed be the name of the
[19:29] lord
[19:30] and so we see
[19:32] that that that that that
[19:35] jesus was coming down that
[19:38] that mountain
[19:40] the mount of olives
[19:43] now brother branham preaches it in the
[19:45] message uh what is the attraction on the
[19:48] mountain
[19:50] and he sees he says here he stands
[19:53] and he's sitting upon a white donkey the
[19:56] bible doesn't say that it was a white
[19:58] donkey
[19:59] but brother brandon was a prophet
[20:02] he could see things
[20:05] you could see what happened in the what
[20:07] happened in the garden of eden you could
[20:09] see what happened and then he could show
[20:11] it in the scriptures
[20:13] with a prophet
[20:15] and and and and what happened is that
[20:20] he said what happened on that mountain
[20:25] he said prophecy was fulfilled
[20:28] and history was made
[20:32] and god has many ways to lead his
[20:34] children
[20:36] i think the last time when i was here
[20:38] was i was preaching about the father
[20:42] how god is a father
[20:44] god is not a dictator
[20:47] god is a father
[20:50] he wants to be a father
[20:52] he wants to be a friend
[20:55] god doesn't want muslim worship you see
[20:58] we can come to church and we can say oh
[21:01] god is great and he is great i mean god
[21:04] knows that he is great
[21:06] because he says there's nobody besides
[21:08] me he knows who he is
[21:11] but when your children come from when
[21:13] you come from work you don't want your
[21:15] children fall on your knees and say oh
[21:17] papa
[21:18] he comes home he brings money so we can
[21:20] go to mcdonald's and but no no no you
[21:23] want your children to hug him
[21:25] [Applause]
[21:26] and god wants his children to hug him
[21:29] said lord we love you
[21:32] because this message
[21:34] brother branham was the voice but there
[21:36] was a voice behind the voice
[21:39] it was our father talking to us
[21:44] we find out that when a person dies that
[21:47] the last of his senses
[21:49] uh that he is losing is his ear is
[21:52] hearing
[21:53] that's what science says or medical
[21:55] sciences and they found out if a young
[21:58] person or a person
[22:00] for example is a fan of michael jackson
[22:03] and that person falls into a coma not
[22:06] that but falls into a coma and you put
[22:09] michael jackson's music on his ears and
[22:12] he was a fan he comes back
[22:14] because he remembers that voice
[22:18] so i told the church if one time i fall
[22:20] into coma you know what you put on my
[22:22] ears okay
[22:23] and if i just listen good evening
[22:25] friends i'm back here
[22:26] [Applause]
[22:27] amen
[22:29] amen
[22:31] so so so so we came on this earth
[22:35] and nobody asked us
[22:38] where do we want to live
[22:41] when do we want to come nobody else or
[22:43] do you want to be black or white
[22:45] nobody asks you
[22:47] do you want to live in america or in
[22:49] germany do you want to be male or female
[22:50] nobody ask you
[22:52] and sometimes we think that our life is
[22:56] was a failure from the beginning
[22:59] and it was a failure
[23:01] until our father
[23:03] called us
[23:05] that changed our life
[23:07] we hurt our father
[23:10] well for us
[23:11] we don't follow branhamism
[23:14] we are christians
[23:16] we are not brahmites
[23:18] we are not in a cult we are christians
[23:21] but we understand who this messenger was
[23:25] because the father is the head of his
[23:27] home
[23:28] a pastor is the head of a local church
[23:31] the messenger is the head of a church
[23:33] age
[23:35] and christ is the head of all seven
[23:37] messengers
[23:39] i was one time asked the question
[23:40] brother marcus can somebody correct the
[23:43] prophet i said sure god can
[23:47] because christ is the head of all seven
[23:49] messengers
[23:50] we have two messengers that were special
[23:52] the first one had a right to write the
[23:55] bible that was paul
[23:57] and the seventh one was the one who was
[23:59] interpreting
[24:01] the unwritten things or the unknown
[24:03] things
[24:05] bringing us rapturing faith
[24:07] but christ is the head of all things
[24:10] therefore we we we are so privileged
[24:14] and we understand how god has different
[24:17] ways to lead
[24:19] one time it was it was time that the the
[24:22] savior had to be born
[24:26] and an angel comes to mary
[24:29] and says
[24:31] behold
[24:32] or she says behold the maid
[24:37] handmaid of the lord
[24:40] she believed the visitation of that
[24:43] angel
[24:44] and we have to understand that we are
[24:46] that mary
[24:48] carrying that christ
[24:50] amen and then she has a husband by the
[24:53] name of joseph and joseph
[24:56] well
[24:56] uh he wanted to believe that story and
[25:00] brother even says that joseph was an
[25:02] older man
[25:04] and he wanted to believe her but he
[25:07] couldn't believe
[25:10] but you have to understand god had to do
[25:12] that something for joseph
[25:16] because joseph was the protection for
[25:18] mary
[25:19] when joseph would have left mary mary
[25:21] would have been stoned
[25:24] so joseph was a gentleman he said we
[25:25] will not make a problem here in the
[25:27] church i will just go
[25:29] so god had to come
[25:33] but god didn't send an angel god came in
[25:35] a dream amen
[25:37] god has many ways to lead his children
[25:41] this is what the pentecostals never
[25:43] understood
[25:45] god has
[25:46] sensational ways and natural ways to
[25:48] lead his children
[25:50] and so when joseph was waking up from
[25:53] his dream he was a different man he
[25:55] could stand
[25:57] you can only stand in your life if you
[26:00] have revelation
[26:03] therefore doctrine is not enough
[26:06] teaching them is not enough
[26:10] it must be revelation from your father
[26:13] so at the same time there were some some
[26:16] some mary and joseph they were living in
[26:18] bethlehem
[26:20] but uh in nazareth
[26:22] but the birth of jesus must have been in
[26:24] bethlehem to fulfill the scripture
[26:27] so we need somebody to bring them from
[26:29] nazareth to bethlehem
[26:31] so god uses just a a great king
[26:35] by the name of of uh was it agrippa or
[26:38] or
[26:39] um
[26:41] the roman the roman
[26:42] cather was augustus
[26:45] argus
[26:46] augustus so so he inspired augustus to
[26:50] make a law
[26:52] that everybody has to come back into
[26:55] their native city
[26:57] and even the generals they said i mean
[26:59] what kind of nonsense is this what kind
[27:01] of law is this and augustus said i don't
[27:04] know but i feel in my heart that
[27:06] everybody in israel has to return back
[27:08] to their home city
[27:09] not knowing that was god inspiring that
[27:12] unbeliever
[27:14] because only that law brought him
[27:18] them here we have mary and joseph and
[27:22] and both
[27:24] the government and the law and the covet
[27:27] and corona and this and trump and this
[27:30] and her and
[27:31] biden and this and
[27:34] not knowing they were the perfect will
[27:36] of god
[27:39] everybody is in god's hands
[27:43] amen
[27:45] i'm a god lead things
[27:48] supernaturally
[27:50] at the same time there were some some
[27:53] some some
[27:55] precious
[27:56] astronomers
[27:57] over there in babylon and they had to be
[28:00] there but god didn't send an angel but
[28:02] they could see a star
[28:04] and brother we have seen the star
[28:07] and this star never let them to
[28:10] themselves they were not looking just oh
[28:12] what a tremendous star let's make some
[28:14] star photos this star was leading them
[28:17] to the king
[28:21] and we have seen his star
[28:23] can you say amen
[28:25] we have seen the seventh star
[28:28] in the hand of god that was william
[28:30] branham and he was not leading us to
[28:32] jeffersonville
[28:34] or to branham tabernacle
[28:36] he was leading us to the king
[28:40] they say amen
[28:42] amen and at the same time there were
[28:44] some some shepherds
[28:47] and they needed some kind like an
[28:49] invitation
[28:51] and god never used a star but god now
[28:53] changed dimensions
[28:56] because out of an unseen dimension now
[28:59] here come the host of angels
[29:02] singing
[29:03] god portraying the rapture
[29:06] the body change
[29:08] if somebody says uh okay the rapture we
[29:11] will fly in the air geographically and
[29:13] fly uh beside the moon and jupiter okay
[29:17] i respect this but i believe it's a
[29:19] changing of dimensions
[29:23] amen let's go all in the rapture then we
[29:26] would see how it was okay
[29:28] come in
[29:30] i mean never make a doctrine out of
[29:32] these no these are just our thoughts
[29:34] about it so so you see god has
[29:37] tremendous ways his children to lead
[29:41] it's not always an angel it's not always
[29:42] a voice it's not always a light
[29:44] sometimes god leads us without us
[29:46] understanding that it was the leadership
[29:48] of god we find out later
[29:51] and so here we start with that story and
[29:54] i i i have no notes but i always have
[29:57] some pictures which makes it especially
[29:58] for the youngsters a little bit more
[30:00] tangible okay that whole story and if
[30:03] brother joe would help us
[30:06] this
[30:07] this is now the story uh this is uh
[30:11] the mount of olives
[30:16] mount of olives is in the
[30:19] east of jerusalem right in front of
[30:24] this is the mountain that jesus came
[30:26] down
[30:29] with this little donkey
[30:32] first he was sending his disciple to a
[30:35] donkey or two those two donkeys
[30:40] and he said and if somebody asked you
[30:42] [Music]
[30:44] why do you need the donkeys you just say
[30:46] the lord
[30:47] has need of them amen
[30:50] rather for some of the people we are
[30:52] nothing else than donkeys
[30:55] but we would say the lord needs us
[30:59] because he has no other hands than your
[31:01] hands
[31:03] he has no other voice than your voice
[31:06] so let me be a donkey for god
[31:09] i always tell the young people uh
[31:12] because we are not too much of the true
[31:14] message believers
[31:15] i said if you are in school and you're
[31:17] all alone
[31:19] but you're if you're standing true with
[31:21] god then whole heaven is on your side
[31:24] and you're in the majority
[31:26] with god you're always in the majority
[31:30] and so here here he comes down that that
[31:33] that that mountain
[31:35] make the next one please brother joe
[31:38] and here we have the view
[31:40] from mount olives to jerusalem the only
[31:44] thing is what changes the building this
[31:46] is now the omaha mosque but in the time
[31:48] of jesus it was still the temple
[31:53] you're looking from the mount of olives
[31:56] straight to the west
[31:59] through outer court sanctuary up to
[32:03] the holies of holies
[32:06] if the doors were open in the temple you
[32:09] could see from the mount of olives the
[32:11] the curtain between the holy place and
[32:14] the holiest of holies
[32:16] and brother blame said
[32:18] the curtain in that temple
[32:21] symbolizes our self
[32:24] our self will
[32:27] exactly so
[32:29] amen
[32:31] but you're looking
[32:33] straight to the west
[32:35] from the east to the west straight
[32:39] and jesus coming now down
[32:42] that mountain
[32:45] a whole group of people were just
[32:48] waiting for him and brother branham said
[32:49] this he said somewhere for him
[32:53] most were against him and some didn't
[32:56] know exactly
[33:00] i'm trusting that this evening everybody
[33:03] is for him
[33:05] i'm here
[33:06] amen hallelujah
[33:09] amen
[33:11] because when they were waiting he said
[33:13] and now the moment comes
[33:16] when on that hill a little white donkey
[33:20] appears
[33:22] and on that donkey is the king of heaven
[33:28] is the i am
[33:30] in his
[33:31] body certainly we know that amen
[33:34] is
[33:35] the prince of peace
[33:38] and when he was just coming down that
[33:41] mountain
[33:42] therefore i always said when you are
[33:44] when you are teaching when we are
[33:46] teaching i know this is a church who is
[33:48] very well taught therefore i don't have
[33:51] problems to
[33:53] to to to go a little bit in some in some
[33:55] points without getting you nervous
[33:57] because i know that you're very much
[33:58] stable in in stabilizing things
[34:02] but sometimes there is such a confusion
[34:04] is he the lamb or is he the lion
[34:10] i said okay i will not answer it for
[34:12] this evening i wouldn't do
[34:14] but i said who was sitting on that
[34:16] donkey
[34:18] on one hand side it was the lamb
[34:22] because he said behold the lamb of god
[34:26] which takes away the sins of the world
[34:29] but at the same time the prophecy is
[34:31] fulfilled
[34:33] shout jerusalem your king amen
[34:37] at the same time he sees the lamb and
[34:39] the lion right on the same thing
[34:42] it depends on the side of your approach
[34:46] but this is not a doctrinal thing okay
[34:48] this is just for that point
[34:50] never make behind our doctrinal thought
[34:54] a full stop a period
[34:56] just make a comment maybe the picture is
[34:59] bigger than i thought before
[35:02] don't get doctrinated
[35:04] because you're closing your own door
[35:06] always say like your little brother
[35:08] marcus from germany i see that way but
[35:11] maybe
[35:12] i will see it different when i'm
[35:14] learning more when the picture becomes
[35:16] bigger
[35:17] because here he sits on that donkey the
[35:20] lamb of god and the king at the same
[35:22] time
[35:23] blessed be the name of the lord
[35:26] so these people are enthused
[35:29] and they are shouting
[35:32] hosanna
[35:37] those who understood who
[35:40] was sitting on that donkey
[35:43] who told them
[35:46] amen who told them
[35:49] because he was just sitting a man
[35:52] i will not read it
[35:54] but in leviticus it is written
[35:57] you will
[35:58] you have to kill the firstborn
[36:01] of your of your of of of
[36:05] of your of of the donkey
[36:09] and you have to redeem it by a lamb
[36:14] exactly and when these people
[36:17] could see here is a lamb on a donkey
[36:20] they could see this is redemption coming
[36:22] down
[36:25] they could place
[36:27] scripture
[36:28] into their actual life and that was the
[36:31] infusement that they had
[36:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[36:37] so
[36:39] they saw who was sitting on that
[36:43] donkey
[36:44] the redeemer of jerusalem amen
[36:48] they saw it
[36:49] how could they see it through the
[36:51] scripture
[36:52] because jesus had no t-shirt i am the
[36:54] one i am
[36:58] who told them
[37:00] the same who will reveal to you who that
[37:03] seventh messenger was
[37:05] the same holy
[37:06] spirit you
[37:08] if you would have lived 2 000 years ago
[37:11] you would be in that crowd crying
[37:14] hosanna
[37:15] because the same holy spirit who is
[37:18] showing you today
[37:19] the word for this day would have
[37:22] revealed to the day the word for that
[37:24] day
[37:27] god is in humor
[37:29] brother brandon was asked the question
[37:31] brother branham please explain the
[37:34] question i think that was brother joe
[37:35] canada's mother please explain uh the
[37:38] question of matthew i think chapter 10
[37:40] what is the reward of a prophet and
[37:42] brother branham smiles it's to be a
[37:43] friend of a prophet and he said he
[37:45] becomes handy it became handy for the
[37:47] shunammite woman and brother branham we
[37:50] we know from his life story that one
[37:52] time in memphis tennessee uh that that
[37:55] the plane
[37:56] was just
[37:57] couldn't leave the earth because of that
[37:59] storm brother blame heard the voice and
[38:01] you just go
[38:03] and i'm quoting brother in my from my
[38:05] memory
[38:06] because i don't know if all the words
[38:08] are politically correct but but
[38:10] please understand i'm a hillbilly from
[38:12] germany i don't have all these okay
[38:14] he said but here is he calls her a negro
[38:17] mama
[38:18] and negro mama was just there and he
[38:20] says hello parson
[38:22] and brother brahma said how do you know
[38:24] that i'm a preacher
[38:26] do you understand normally it was
[38:27] brother branham revealing the people
[38:30] your name is eva i see you in the car
[38:32] accident but now that woman is revealing
[38:35] the prophet
[38:37] and brother bran doesn't know who she is
[38:38] but she knows who he is
[38:43] amen and then he said how do you know
[38:44] that i'm that i'm that that i'm a
[38:46] minister she said because i am the
[38:48] shunammite woman and you are the prophet
[38:49] elijah
[38:51] god just turned the picture
[38:55] you say that's tremendous the same thing
[38:56] happened to you who told you
[38:59] the same holy spirit
[39:01] i'm a blessed be the name of the lord
[39:05] do you understand revelation has nothing
[39:07] to do with intel intellect
[39:10] at home i'm a janitor
[39:14] shame of the family
[39:16] but i have a father
[39:18] i have a father
[39:22] i come from another family
[39:25] and my father is proud of me
[39:28] my earthly father said you should have
[39:29] been an engineer with your skills i said
[39:31] i have to be involved my father
[39:34] in the business of my father
[39:36] blessed be the name of the lord so these
[39:38] people
[39:39] when they were seeing the messiah coming
[39:42] down
[39:43] there wouldn't just be oh that that's
[39:45] that's deep brother
[39:47] that's nice that's deep man brother
[39:49] marcus is deep sometimes we have young
[39:50] people that come brother marcus brother
[39:53] so-and-so he was so deep and i said okay
[39:55] and what did you understand nothing yeah
[39:57] that's wonderful
[39:59] but that's that's how it goes
[40:01] i mean
[40:02] and we have to help the people to create
[40:04] a vision but they were so enthused that
[40:06] they took their jacket throwed it on
[40:10] in my preaching i have never seen
[40:12] somebody taking this jacket and throw it
[40:14] on
[40:15] you don't have to
[40:17] but they were so enthused that they took
[40:19] their jackets they knew who was sitting
[40:21] on that donkey
[40:23] it was the king of kings and the lord of
[40:26] lords just in the human flesh
[40:28] blessed be the name of the lord you make
[40:31] the next one please
[40:32] so that is what we want to have is is is
[40:36] is is stimulation by revelation
[40:41] therefore we see that that that
[40:43] christian rock music is entering even in
[40:46] what we call the message of the hour
[40:48] because the people are born
[40:51] bored by the preaching
[40:53] but they're only born because they don't
[40:55] read right
[40:57] amen you have to eat that book
[41:01] and then dan
[41:03] look
[41:05] i was a young boy we were we were not
[41:07] believers we were young we were
[41:09] unbelievers
[41:11] and i i and i know i was a fan at the
[41:14] time of arnold schwarzenegger and
[41:16] sylvester stallone
[41:18] i remember this and i remember arnie he
[41:20] he he comes from austria so he speaks
[41:22] good german so he was in a tv show he
[41:25] was just moving his breasts
[41:29] so i was a small boy i was smaller than
[41:32] the girls in my class and god knows how
[41:34] to how to
[41:36] how to how to humble us
[41:39] i said it last time already i had to i
[41:42] was the only boy who had to swim with
[41:44] the girls
[41:46] you say brother mark that was fine no it
[41:48] was not fine no
[41:49] that that was embarrassing i tell you
[41:51] because everything
[41:55] so i was making bodybuilding and i want
[41:57] to tell the youngsters maybe here's
[41:59] somebody who is that's fine okay but i
[42:02] want to tell you one thing
[42:03] everything that is here today was here
[42:08] it was just changing of dispensation
[42:10] okay
[42:11] it was here okay so so nothing wrong but
[42:14] you have to understand you have to build
[42:16] your soul
[42:18] the rest i wouldn't say waste of time
[42:20] it's fine but but
[42:24] i found out one thing
[42:26] is the natural types the spiritual
[42:29] if you want to have muscles you cannot
[42:31] eat mcdonald's
[42:35] so
[42:36] okay
[42:37] the first row can you say amen the
[42:38] sisters
[42:40] i know this is now death to himself
[42:45] if you want to have muscles you cannot
[42:47] eat mcdonald's you need
[42:49] a steak
[42:50] you need something real
[42:52] and if you want to have spiritual
[42:54] muscles
[42:55] you need
[42:56] you don't need what's up
[42:58] this is social
[43:00] that's fine nothing against let's be
[43:02] social you don't need harry potter you
[43:04] need spiritual food in due seasons
[43:08] blessed be the name of the lord oh there
[43:10] will be a true form and let's reign in
[43:12] the last day upon that little group that
[43:14] come on his little donkey low and humbly
[43:17] no denomination and i always say no
[43:20] denomination in the message or outside
[43:22] of the message
[43:24] because this message will not be a
[43:26] denomination but we will see
[43:27] denominations in the message already
[43:30] this message will never be occult but we
[43:32] see cultish ideas
[43:34] in this and we are not agreeing with
[43:36] that at all
[43:38] the ministry of brotherhood was the
[43:40] eliezer ministry who was connecting us
[43:42] with christ
[43:44] i'm blessed to be the name hosanna to
[43:46] the king that comes in the name of the
[43:48] lord what's the matter today what is the
[43:50] attraction on the mountain what what
[43:52] what was brother brahm now mentioning
[43:54] he's bringing the idea of the mount of
[43:56] olives to sunset mountain in our time
[43:59] amen
[44:02] amen
[44:07] the bible says only the lamb can open
[44:09] the book amen and the voice says to
[44:11] brother brahm go and open the book
[44:15] oh
[44:16] the bible says only land can open the
[44:18] book the voice of you go open the book
[44:21] do we see that sometimes we have
[44:23] even denominational thoughts
[44:26] of of of things because revelation is a
[44:29] book of symbols
[44:32] the voice says go to jefferson and open
[44:34] those seven seals amen
[44:37] amen
[44:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[44:41] i mean make the next one and here we
[44:43] have it
[44:45] here we have it
[44:46] amen what
[44:48] what happened in this day brother
[44:50] brandon said three
[44:51] three years ago it was a prophecy now
[44:54] it's history revelation 10 1-7 is
[44:57] fulfilled
[45:02] therefore we have some people that live
[45:06] in laodicea
[45:08] and we still live in laodicea
[45:12] but brother brahman said in the message
[45:14] paradox in laodicea age there is a new
[45:17] age coming he calls it in ephesians
[45:22] so some people are just living in
[45:24] darkness
[45:28] the only breach we don't have
[45:30] we are blind
[45:32] uh
[45:33] we are miserable we are this
[45:36] but brother the bride is not in loud
[45:39] he's here
[45:41] we're living loud this year all right
[45:43] amen
[45:45] mean
[45:47] therefore we have
[45:48] we have still presidents
[45:51] he's a loser
[45:54] marcus becker
[45:58] low energy man from where does he come
[46:00] from germany
[46:04] and i'm
[46:12] tremendous i mean
[46:15] marcus baker even looks like angela
[46:17] merkel
[46:19] his vision comes from china
[46:23] we are still in that and we respect us
[46:25] and we love that but brother the bride
[46:29] is in bright age
[46:32] why because brother bram says shalom
[46:36] good morning church
[46:37] what does it mean the night is over
[46:42] good morning
[46:44] shalom amen
[46:46] it's the what is it it's the rising of
[46:48] the sun
[46:50] in the hebrew the light begin the new
[46:52] day begins with the night the evening is
[46:54] the beginning of the new day
[46:56] but here is the rising of the sun
[46:58] there's a man who can turn on the light
[47:01] the blood the bride
[47:03] she is not blind
[47:06] she is not miserable
[47:08] she is not wretched
[47:11] the bride she is closed by the garment
[47:14] of the words
[47:16] the bride can say he is here hallelujah
[47:24] so when it comes to politics i don't
[47:26] make sights okay i'm a neutral german so
[47:28] don't take it personally okay
[47:32] amen
[47:35] amen because then i'm surely in a bad
[47:38] position i know
[47:40] like the next one but you take a sense
[47:43] of humor that always helps a little bit
[47:45] so when brother branham came what is the
[47:48] message of brother bryn
[47:50] he is here my message is to declare he's
[47:54] here
[47:55] so when brother branham came on the
[47:56] scene in the beginning of the last
[47:58] century the pentecostal revival was
[48:01] already on
[48:04] there was already divine healing
[48:07] we have these people like like alexander
[48:10] dowie uh we have a ff boss but we have
[48:13] seymour
[48:15] we have
[48:16] i always say this is always a nice
[48:18] comparison the the great general of
[48:21] israel he was the man with the man with
[48:23] one eye bringing israel back to the
[48:26] temple mount and here is he is seymour
[48:28] the man with one eye bringing
[48:29] pentecostal revival so brother blame had
[48:32] didn't have to come to bring pentecost
[48:35] in fact
[48:37] as paul was not in the upper room
[48:39] brother branham was not
[48:41] at pentecost
[48:42] both came later and brother branham said
[48:44] i'm a man called to be born out of
[48:47] season like paul
[48:49] he had to so that the pentecost could
[48:51] fall and we would see the need of the
[48:53] message of the hour
[48:56] so do we understand that this message
[48:59] brought us on a higher level
[49:02] we are preaching things that was never
[49:04] preached in 2000 years ago because
[49:06] revelation 10 is fulfilled
[49:09] christ is here
[49:10] we're waiting for meeting him in the air
[49:12] that's true but christ is here
[49:15] blessed be the name of the lord so so
[49:17] the healing revival is going on all
[49:19] these things and
[49:21] make the next one please
[49:23] and then we see
[49:25] how church became an entertainment
[49:29] he said 1959 and brother sister i have
[49:31] been back in the cave long enough and
[49:34] you have to to know that there has been
[49:35] a lot of earthquakes shaking around a
[49:38] lot of noise and fusses and stews and
[49:40] things like that and big meetings but
[49:42] where has been god out of it
[49:44] that's the reason i said what i said
[49:46] this morning there has to come something
[49:48] deeper than a healing service there has
[49:50] to come something deeper than the gift
[49:52] of speaking in tongues there has to
[49:53] become something deeper than a rushing
[49:55] mighty wind
[49:56] what followed it a still small voice
[50:00] and brother said the prophet elijah he
[50:03] was he was not shaken by nothing
[50:08] so please don't come and say brother
[50:09] marcus and here's a healing gift and he
[50:12] comes through america and this and this
[50:14] happened and you have to say so what
[50:18] so what that's fine we appreciate this
[50:20] but our attraction is not a gift anymore
[50:24] it's not a ministry anymore
[50:27] brother marcus who do you think he's the
[50:29] man of the hour i know one thing christ
[50:31] is the man of the hour for the bride
[50:36] amen
[50:38] so we see that that that that that for
[50:41] example let caller name our most noble
[50:43] brother oral roberts he had 50
[50:46] television channels
[50:48] therefore we had to collect all the
[50:49] money
[50:51] and at the at a certain time it was not
[50:54] enough that that it was just preached
[50:58] but they needed some kind like a
[51:01] like a good singer
[51:02] because people wanted to have a little
[51:04] bit christian entertainment so they
[51:06] brought people in like like uh pat boone
[51:08] and so forth
[51:11] and it took away the sincerity of the
[51:13] people
[51:14] the honesty
[51:17] the thing of being between life and
[51:20] death with your god
[51:23] the cry for we have to get it
[51:26] lord give me that revelation
[51:29] like we were praying in the beginning
[51:31] give me the holy ghost
[51:33] we will not say okay if not lord then
[51:36] no no
[51:37] lord
[51:38] i need the holy ghost and you have to
[51:40] say one thing lord i need growth in my
[51:43] life
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:48] because one thing was sure these
[51:49] pentecostals were good men but god tell
[51:52] brother branham he said you cannot teach
[51:54] pentecostal babies supernatural thing
[51:57] that is what so they were born again if
[52:00] not you cannot be a baby
[52:02] but you can but god will not marry a
[52:04] little baby
[52:06] this bride who goes into the rapture
[52:08] will be a full bride
[52:10] she knows who she is
[52:12] she knows where she stands
[52:15] she is not shaken by nothing
[52:18] blessed being a lord amen
[52:21] did you ever notice that no there was
[52:23] not one gift
[52:25] not one prophet in the denominations or
[52:28] in the message were warning us from
[52:30] kovitt
[52:32] nobody said in two years the churches
[52:35] will be closed this happens we see
[52:36] ministers dying
[52:38] or passing away
[52:41] do you think god doesn't know what he
[52:43] does
[52:44] god wants us to learn
[52:47] to be prepared whatever comes our way we
[52:50] are br we're ready
[52:53] whatever comes our way
[52:56] because when kovite 19 ends kovy 20 will
[52:59] arrive
[53:01] and we must come to a place that we say
[53:03] whatever comes lord i'm ready
[53:09] amen it is not the situation who will
[53:12] master me i will master the situation
[53:16] blessed be the name of the lord so there
[53:19] must come something deeper you may
[53:20] please the next one this is at the end
[53:22] of the 50s
[53:24] so
[53:25] therefore you see my little little
[53:27] little sense of humor it's not only in
[53:28] the u.s especially in germany because
[53:31] we were here this is the place
[53:34] in nuremberg where adolf hitler was
[53:36] making his great speeches
[53:40] and these german soldiers when you see
[53:42] them thousands of making the same
[53:43] movement and so
[53:45] so what we did we were with some young
[53:48] people there
[53:50] now on that picture you see some young
[53:52] of our
[53:53] some young people of our church and
[53:54] there was a charismatic church
[53:58] and uh no they were all in in mini
[54:01] skirts
[54:03] and so i'm very happy for photoshop
[54:07] so i could cut everything out that is
[54:09] not fitting for a message church okay so
[54:12] thanks be to god for powerpoint and
[54:14] photoshop and all these things that
[54:16] makes it possible but there was quite a
[54:18] difference
[54:19] but what happened is this so i had my
[54:21] bible with me
[54:23] and we were right at the place where
[54:25] hitler was declaring his millennium you
[54:28] see the millennium is not for the
[54:29] germans it's for the bride
[54:31] okay so
[54:33] some of the germans will be there i hope
[54:35] so okay but look and i hold up the bible
[54:38] like this and i said this
[54:42] hitler is dead but jesus lives and
[54:44] everybody was clapping and here comes a
[54:46] pastor he said oh are you christian he
[54:49] said we are christians
[54:50] and he says do you love israel he said
[54:52] we love israel that's wonderful and he
[54:55] says i'm the pastor of the charismatic
[54:57] church in
[54:59] in nuremberg and so we made a
[55:02] picture together with message believers
[55:04] and with the charismatic church
[55:06] so let me say in for 10 minutes i was in
[55:10] the ecomedical movement
[55:12] but then i heard the eagles cry come out
[55:15] of babylon and i came out again okay
[55:17] but
[55:18] why shouldn't we respect people because
[55:21] we're not changing them
[55:23] let them brother blame said god have
[55:26] dollars
[55:27] and god have sins
[55:29] and pennies
[55:31] he says let these pennies be pennies and
[55:34] then brother bram said this he said god
[55:37] uses them
[55:39] why should i let everybody be this is
[55:42] this is time of harvest everybody shows
[55:45] his colors anyhow
[55:46] so you see somebody just respect him
[55:49] wish him god's blessings and go for it
[55:52] we don't have to waste our time to
[55:53] holler against the baptist and this no
[55:55] let's we we are bright age we let's go
[55:58] forward a little bit in these things
[56:00] blessed be the name anyhow
[56:04] gospel is always good news
[56:07] and there will be people getting
[56:10] their reward on the white throne
[56:12] judgment and i say god bless you for
[56:14] this
[56:15] amen recipe so so we make a little
[56:18] picture and he gave me his card so the
[56:19] next thing comes
[56:21] i mean
[56:22] but yeah now here is his card
[56:25] from his church
[56:27] and he says in my own words she said uh
[56:31] great services
[56:32] uh modern life music music
[56:36] dynamic youth work and and ant okay
[56:40] so in their church they don't have a
[56:42] pulpit this is a charismatic church and
[56:44] if you see a charismatic church it's two
[56:46] hours singing
[56:47] 15 minutes preaching and then two hours
[56:50] worshiping about the 50 minutes what
[56:52] they heard
[56:54] it's a miracle to do this but they don't
[56:56] do
[56:57] in between that three times take an
[56:58] offering i mean
[57:00] honestly honestly
[57:02] and and they make it openly they put it
[57:04] right in front and everybody comes in
[57:06] [Music]
[57:11] okay
[57:13] that's how it goes
[57:14] so they don't have a pulpit and i always
[57:16] say they don't need a pulpit because
[57:18] they have nothing just nothing to say
[57:21] but they have let me say if this
[57:24] this is how it is okay no pulpit
[57:27] and on their visiting card they have
[57:29] directly the mark of the mcdonald's
[57:32] right where the next methodology is
[57:34] so they can tell the young people look
[57:36] we go to church
[57:37] but children
[57:39] he's only preaching 15 minutes but then
[57:41] we go for burgers okay yeah okay this is
[57:47] okay
[57:48] that's fine i heard it about the church
[57:50] of hillsong i mean these people are
[57:52] clever hillsong make a real youth
[57:55] program
[57:57] during the service and the children say
[57:59] mama we want to go to church because
[58:01] they have disneyland they have all kinds
[58:02] of things but i want to say honestly
[58:05] brother
[58:06] i know children are children and let us
[58:08] have a lot of patience with our children
[58:10] let us wait until god gets them that's
[58:12] them and sometimes a church stuff is
[58:14] boring for them i know this okay unless
[58:16] you make little jokes in the beginning
[58:18] or you look them in the face and say
[58:20] okay then it goes okay
[58:24] but it's not okay
[58:26] but
[58:28] sooner or later
[58:30] you have to catch them by the word
[58:33] if the word does not keep them in church
[58:36] nothing will keep them in church
[58:39] you will just keep them by entertainment
[58:41] you make it just a new lodge
[58:43] just a new club just a new association
[58:45] we are the uh good luck brothers or we
[58:48] are the uh happy
[58:50] uh always happy bowling game team or
[58:52] whatever
[58:53] this is look brother we have to pay
[58:56] attention that our young people don't
[58:58] become religious in the message
[59:01] they need the holy spirit
[59:04] and sometimes you take a family and you
[59:06] see the children and and
[59:08] they're just on the photos
[59:14] and we say and this is the model family
[59:16] but some of the model families is just
[59:18] rich young rulers
[59:21] they were never born again they know how
[59:23] to behave themselves in church right
[59:25] from their use
[59:27] this is what the rich young ruler says
[59:28] brother this is dangerous
[59:31] because when the word tests come they
[59:33] cannot stand the test
[59:35] because everything is just the outside
[59:37] the outside is important but it's not
[59:38] the main thing the main thing must be
[59:40] the heart of a person
[59:43] i mean sometimes you can have a very
[59:44] perfect house and you have an arrogant
[59:46] spirit it will never bring you forth
[59:48] brother blame said if you want to
[59:49] continue with god never allow an
[59:51] arrogant spirit to lead you
[59:53] listen okay next one please so what
[59:55] happens is this here is brother branham
[59:58] and he says and it just picked me up and
[1:00:01] took me up and you remember that he said
[1:00:03] there must come something deeper and why
[1:00:05] up where a meeting was going on on
[1:00:07] looked like a tent or a cathedral of
[1:00:10] some sort
[1:00:11] and i looked and there was a little box
[1:00:13] like little place over on the side and i
[1:00:16] seen that light
[1:00:18] talking to somebody above me that light
[1:00:20] that you see over on the picture it
[1:00:22] worked away from me like that and went
[1:00:24] over to that tent and said i will meet
[1:00:28] you there
[1:00:29] and said this will be the third poll and
[1:00:32] you won't tell nobody and in sabino
[1:00:35] canyon he said this is the third pool
[1:00:39] now i give now my view
[1:00:43] and it's a biblical view if this is the
[1:00:45] whole picture
[1:00:47] because we know prophecies have compound
[1:00:49] meanings
[1:00:51] we respect this but i think here is a
[1:00:54] good approach
[1:00:56] now
[1:00:57] the pillar of fire went over some
[1:01:00] tent or some cathedral
[1:01:03] and the voice says to brother branham i
[1:01:06] will meet you there
[1:01:09] remember it's a vision
[1:01:11] visions can be natural fulfillments like
[1:01:15] marilyn monroe
[1:01:16] are symbolic fulfillments like pharaoh
[1:01:20] and the seven cows that was just a
[1:01:22] symbol
[1:01:23] or they have a spiritual application
[1:01:27] like nebuchadnezzar and the statue was
[1:01:30] pure
[1:01:31] spiritual applications
[1:01:34] sometimes it's natural sometimes it's
[1:01:36] symbolic
[1:01:38] to take something spiritual natural
[1:01:40] brings you in problem
[1:01:42] because we have precious brothers in
[1:01:44] south america
[1:01:46] they are now building a big tent
[1:01:49] in order to fulfill the tenth meeting
[1:01:53] the tenth vision and we have it in
[1:01:55] youtube when they say oh and now we are
[1:01:58] fulfilling here what brother brandt
[1:01:59] think in costa rica we are fulfilling
[1:02:02] what brother branham said he will come
[1:02:03] to a big tent in a little cathedral
[1:02:07] and i always tell this
[1:02:10] if the tent that brother bram saw in
[1:02:12] that vision is a natural tent
[1:02:15] now if the tent is in germany then
[1:02:19] good night
[1:02:20] [Laughter]
[1:02:24] and if the tent is in the u.s
[1:02:28] then there is only one which get blessed
[1:02:31] lufthansa
[1:02:36] i mean
[1:02:37] that's what one of the of the brothers
[1:02:39] said brother brother marcus you have to
[1:02:41] come to this and this convention to get
[1:02:43] rapturing faith
[1:02:45] i said the only one who's blessed is
[1:02:47] lufthansa because rapturing faces in the
[1:02:49] message of the hour brother
[1:02:51] not in a special convention forget that
[1:02:53] idea you brought it from denominations
[1:02:55] right in it
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:58] so the question is where is the tent
[1:03:01] okay
[1:03:04] this is one
[1:03:05] aspect there's a lot of answers to this
[1:03:08] okay and i will not dare to give an
[1:03:10] interpretation to to something what the
[1:03:12] prophet said but i think when we bring
[1:03:13] it biblically we can have an idea
[1:03:17] okay
[1:03:18] so
[1:03:19] make the next one please brother joe now
[1:03:21] now who was the first one who had a tent
[1:03:24] vision
[1:03:25] that was moses
[1:03:28] because moses was taking up into heaven
[1:03:31] and he sees the heavenly temple
[1:03:33] and when he comes down he shall he he
[1:03:36] was told to build a tabernacle according
[1:03:41] to the vision that he had in heaven
[1:03:46] he was the first one having a tent
[1:03:48] vision
[1:03:49] and he builds it and then and and
[1:03:51] solomon was building his temple exactly
[1:03:54] according to the vision that moses had
[1:03:57] because it was god's vision
[1:04:00] and it was the messenger of our hour of
[1:04:02] our day who revealed what that means
[1:04:05] that temple is the human being
[1:04:10] that is a human because because nothing
[1:04:12] is made in the image of god than just
[1:04:15] men
[1:04:18] brother brother
[1:04:20] respect every man on earth even if he's
[1:04:22] a muslim
[1:04:24] even if it's a bump on the street you
[1:04:26] say this is nothing else this is another
[1:04:28] this is just a bump and uh he's not a
[1:04:31] message believer he's nothing i can walk
[1:04:33] over him remember that bump
[1:04:36] that vagabond he is the son of a mother
[1:04:40] and for her it's her son and maybe she
[1:04:43] is the daddy of a little girl
[1:04:45] and for her this man is daddy
[1:04:48] brother you're never wrong in respecting
[1:04:51] people you're never wrong you don't have
[1:04:54] to agree with all things but shake
[1:04:56] everybody's hand wish them well
[1:04:58] even even in the messages this is the
[1:05:01] man no he said wish them well god bless
[1:05:03] you amen
[1:05:05] brother marcus we have some an idea and
[1:05:07] now we have the man of the hour and here
[1:05:08] comes the new wave he said god bless you
[1:05:10] which we will see the effects if it's
[1:05:12] god's behind we will see the fruit
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:18] so so moses had a tent vision
[1:05:22] and what was it it was the human being
[1:05:24] it was body
[1:05:26] spirit soul in a man
[1:05:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:32] hallelujah
[1:05:35] let me let me let me let me make the
[1:05:37] next one please
[1:05:42] cringing five one i i read it in english
[1:05:45] the long longer verse
[1:05:53] sorry is it second corinthians 5. just
[1:05:56] give me a second gentlemen
[1:06:02] yeah
[1:06:03] for we know
[1:06:05] that if our earthly house of this
[1:06:07] tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:06:10] building of god a house not made with
[1:06:12] hands eternal in the heavens
[1:06:15] that is our
[1:06:16] theophany that is sure that's what the
[1:06:19] prophet said
[1:06:20] he said if our earthly house of this
[1:06:22] tabernacle another translation said of
[1:06:25] this tent
[1:06:27] for in this
[1:06:28] we groan earnestly desiring to be closed
[1:06:31] upon with our house which is from heaven
[1:06:34] for we that are in this tabernacle and
[1:06:37] the german sensation in this tent
[1:06:40] do groan being burdened not for that we
[1:06:42] would be unclosed but closed upon that
[1:06:45] mortality might be swallowed up in life
[1:06:49] so remember one thing
[1:06:51] i'm a very sympathetic type of person
[1:06:54] very honestly if you only would know me
[1:06:59] because i live in a german tent
[1:07:03] with german genes
[1:07:05] and germs therefore germany many germs
[1:07:08] that goes along
[1:07:10] okay fits together
[1:07:12] standing in my own way
[1:07:15] having my complexes
[1:07:17] having my traumas
[1:07:19] having
[1:07:20] standing in my own way
[1:07:22] but this is only my tent
[1:07:25] my real me
[1:07:27] the real man who i am is on the inside
[1:07:31] and if this tent
[1:07:33] is dissolved i'm stepping into my
[1:07:35] theophany
[1:07:37] and you stepping in your theophany
[1:07:41] that is the real you
[1:07:45] that is your real personality
[1:07:47] therefore we are standing in our own way
[1:07:51] we live in a tabernacle
[1:07:53] but just for a little period of time we
[1:07:56] live in a tent but just for 70 80 years
[1:07:59] maybe a little bit more but just the
[1:08:01] average
[1:08:02] but from there is not the end we are
[1:08:05] entering into a building of god
[1:08:09] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:11] what is the difference between a
[1:08:13] theophany and and a sinner who goes into
[1:08:16] some kind like a body a theophany is a
[1:08:18] part of god
[1:08:20] it's part of the word itself
[1:08:23] blessed be the name of the lord next one
[1:08:25] please
[1:08:26] therefore we're reading a psalm of david
[1:08:28] the lord is my light and brother brandon
[1:08:30] preaches in the rapture
[1:08:32] of my salvation whom shall i fear the
[1:08:34] lord is the strength of my life of whom
[1:08:36] shall i be afraid when the wicked even
[1:08:39] my enemies and the foes came upon me to
[1:08:41] eat upon my flesh they stumbled and fell
[1:08:43] and so forth
[1:08:45] one thing have i desired of the lord
[1:08:47] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[1:08:49] in the house of the lord all the days of
[1:08:51] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:08:54] and to inquire in his temple for in the
[1:08:56] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:08:58] pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:09:03] of his tent
[1:09:06] hallelujah
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:09] what is it
[1:09:11] in time of trouble
[1:09:14] your own theophany will come
[1:09:19] because we know that if our earthly body
[1:09:22] will be dissolved we have
[1:09:24] not maybe
[1:09:26] god will construct something just before
[1:09:29] we die it's there we know it's there
[1:09:35] i always say this when when the time for
[1:09:38] the rapture was for elijah
[1:09:40] it was not elijah searching
[1:09:43] the chariot
[1:09:45] it was the chariot searching elijah
[1:09:49] and on that chariot was a name and
[1:09:51] nobody could enter
[1:09:55] hallelujah
[1:09:58] gospel is good
[1:10:00] news therefore brother branham was with
[1:10:03] the christian businessman and he we know
[1:10:05] the difference between assurance and
[1:10:07] insurance and and he says brother
[1:10:08] brandon what is your what is your
[1:10:10] business you have assurance and he said
[1:10:12] mine is insured
[1:10:13] insurance
[1:10:15] and the person said to brother brandon
[1:10:17] my insurance
[1:10:19] will take you to the grave
[1:10:22] and brother brahm said and my assurance
[1:10:23] will take you out of it
[1:10:25] [Laughter]
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:29] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:10:32] brother i i will not preach about this
[1:10:34] evening
[1:10:35] but it's a tremendous statement that
[1:10:37] brother brandon made i know i can make
[1:10:39] fanaticism out of it but let the message
[1:10:41] stand what the messenger said he said
[1:10:43] quickening power brought me behind the
[1:10:45] curtain of time and i saw all of you
[1:10:47] there
[1:10:50] that is something tremendous
[1:10:53] therefore that woman at the well
[1:10:56] she was in such a terrible condition
[1:11:00] but she had a representation
[1:11:02] before god
[1:11:04] she did not get representation because
[1:11:07] jesus went by but jesus went by because
[1:11:09] she had representation she was born with
[1:11:12] that representation
[1:11:14] but then life came brother brandon
[1:11:16] explained how she was a young girl she
[1:11:18] was mistreated by one of the husbands
[1:11:21] and they are the first husband and then
[1:11:22] she was throwing away her life
[1:11:25] but all the time she had representation
[1:11:28] right before god
[1:11:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:33] our gospel is not you know sometime
[1:11:37] we feel
[1:11:38] saved we feel good
[1:11:41] sometimes we feel even the bright
[1:11:43] yeah
[1:11:44] we feel really good
[1:11:46] okay but sometimes we feel nothing
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:51] but god cannot go after our feelings
[1:11:56] god had made an eternal decision
[1:11:59] feelings here are no feelings
[1:12:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:12:05] next one please i'm i'm hurrying through
[1:12:07] amen here we go
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] here
[1:12:13] now
[1:12:16] the tenth vision
[1:12:19] don't search in south america
[1:12:22] don't search in tucson
[1:12:24] don't search in jeffersonville
[1:12:28] why don't you search here
[1:12:30] why don't you think the bride is the
[1:12:32] tent amen
[1:12:36] maybe it's different
[1:12:38] maybe i'm wrong
[1:12:40] but i believe i'm i'm not too wrong
[1:12:42] about this
[1:12:43] i don't believe i'm too right or wrong
[1:12:45] with this you understand then that means
[1:12:47] the revival is in me
[1:12:50] the rapture is in me
[1:12:52] i mean i don't need superman to come and
[1:12:54] here comes superman
[1:12:58] i mean have a super preaching and he
[1:13:00] says okay
[1:13:04] you know one thing everything to take me
[1:13:07] home lays in me
[1:13:09] lays in the seeds
[1:13:11] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:14] how do you know now
[1:13:16] who know who who who showed you what
[1:13:19] happened in these days not only god sent
[1:13:22] a prophet
[1:13:23] because our roberts knew that god sent a
[1:13:25] prophet benny hinn says brilliant
[1:13:27] branham was a prophet
[1:13:29] but you can identify what happened on
[1:13:32] sunset mountain back in the scripture
[1:13:34] and you see it in your own life
[1:13:38] blessed be the name of the lord you are
[1:13:40] the group that would stand there
[1:13:43] at mount olives and would say hosanna to
[1:13:45] the king
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:47] blessed be the name so
[1:13:49] so here we have these three men and they
[1:13:52] were just following
[1:13:55] the stars and finishing by this
[1:13:59] three astronomers
[1:14:02] they have seen the star
[1:14:06] brother
[1:14:07] i take a lot of care of people who are
[1:14:09] coming back to church i have a little
[1:14:10] outreach
[1:14:12] and we've got plenty of young people
[1:14:14] went into the world
[1:14:15] and we see them coming back
[1:14:19] but they always come back marred
[1:14:22] sometime with a baby without out of out
[1:14:24] of the holy wedlock
[1:14:26] sometimes in drugs sometimes in alcohol
[1:14:29] but they try to find their way back
[1:14:31] i said look you have to pay for all your
[1:14:33] nonsense that you did
[1:14:36] but if you want to come back to god it's
[1:14:38] our duty to give you a hand
[1:14:41] hey you can have my hand okay and i see
[1:14:44] brother sister
[1:14:46] i see how the word of the lord slowly
[1:14:50] but surely changed the persons
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:55] a young a young person we have different
[1:14:57] ones and even brother when we talk about
[1:14:59] suicide of young people it's not out of
[1:15:01] out of the message
[1:15:03] it's part of of our community today
[1:15:06] ten years ago we would have never
[1:15:08] believed that but today we see this part
[1:15:10] of our community we have to deal with
[1:15:12] all these things
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:15] and and and because i'm dealing with
[1:15:17] some of them and one of them is back and
[1:15:19] he's now starting to preach
[1:15:22] i mean
[1:15:23] and everybody says brother marcus who
[1:15:25] laid
[1:15:26] hands on that boy
[1:15:29] i said nobody
[1:15:30] but i was just telling him i said you
[1:15:32] just sit there and let the word of the
[1:15:35] lord change your heart you just believe
[1:15:38] what is said
[1:15:40] and you see your true identity who you
[1:15:42] are and from that on you will leave the
[1:15:44] things of the world you know it's not
[1:15:45] part of you
[1:15:46] that was one of the smokers he said
[1:15:48] brother mike i want to get
[1:15:49] quit of smoking i said look if you have
[1:15:51] the desire it's already god's starting
[1:15:53] because he gives a desire and he's a
[1:15:55] fulfillment
[1:15:56] i said you have to understand you're a
[1:15:58] child of god but you were trapped
[1:16:00] in all kind of nonsense
[1:16:03] the moment you understand who you are
[1:16:04] you would say it has it is not part of
[1:16:07] me
[1:16:07] and then it has no grip anymore on you
[1:16:11] automatically and and we see i see
[1:16:13] what brother branham preaches
[1:16:16] the transforming power is in the word of
[1:16:18] the lord not conform these people but
[1:16:22] let the word show them who they are and
[1:16:24] and then slowly but surely blessed be
[1:16:27] the name of the lord
[1:16:29] it is a process
[1:16:30] it's not that superman comes and another
[1:16:33] altar called he says no you make it step
[1:16:34] by step
[1:16:37] and we see us in one year from here and
[1:16:39] you will be a different person
[1:16:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:16:43] this message that we believe has
[1:16:45] transforming power never forget it it's
[1:16:48] not a doctrine of william branham
[1:16:50] no
[1:16:51] amen because it's it comes from our
[1:16:53] father
[1:16:55] so when they were just going and they
[1:16:57] were just following the stars
[1:16:59] they entered into jerusalem
[1:17:02] and they said one thing
[1:17:04] said where is the king of the jews and
[1:17:07] brother branham explains
[1:17:10] people have spirits don't forget it
[1:17:14] you a wrong you you go along with the
[1:17:17] right kind of people and you lose the
[1:17:19] vision for the star
[1:17:22] because brother abraham said when they
[1:17:23] entered into jerusalem they were mixing
[1:17:26] with the pharisees and sadducees and
[1:17:28] when they did this they didn't see the
[1:17:30] star anymore
[1:17:32] it was just the influence of those
[1:17:35] people
[1:17:38] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:17:40] and when they left israel and when they
[1:17:43] left jerusalem
[1:17:44] and they left the company of those
[1:17:46] people brother brahim said they could
[1:17:48] see the star again
[1:17:50] you have to choose your company
[1:17:53] i always say this brother if you are
[1:17:55] around people that doesn't like marcus
[1:17:57] becker immediate
[1:17:59] i'm too far away so that you have to
[1:18:01] love me because i'm on the other side of
[1:18:02] the ocean
[1:18:03] even if i'm a loser no no problem if i'm
[1:18:05] a loser okay but i'm far away okay
[1:18:08] but if you are around people that hate
[1:18:10] that hate marcus becker
[1:18:13] if you're around these people one day
[1:18:15] you will hate marcus becker you don't
[1:18:16] know why
[1:18:17] it is the anointing of those people
[1:18:21] stay away from people who always have
[1:18:24] something to say
[1:18:25] i tell the young people there's two
[1:18:27] things with no tolerance in our lives we
[1:18:29] have a lot of toilets we must have
[1:18:31] tolerance today but no tolerance in
[1:18:32] immorality
[1:18:34] zero tolerance
[1:18:36] and when it comes to speak bad about
[1:18:38] preachers do you have to directly put on
[1:18:41] the phone he said we're not talking
[1:18:42] about that thing
[1:18:44] because this must be an evil spirit
[1:18:47] can you say amen amen
[1:18:49] absolutely so
[1:18:50] so they came
[1:18:52] and they saw again the star
[1:18:55] so when they followed the star
[1:18:58] jesus was already two years old
[1:19:01] so they now
[1:19:03] brought
[1:19:05] gifts
[1:19:07] and the gifts were the expression
[1:19:11] of their revelation
[1:19:13] because you bring gifts to two years but
[1:19:15] all boys you go to toys r us
[1:19:19] sure
[1:19:20] but here the first one comes and i can
[1:19:24] see him kneeling down putting gold there
[1:19:29] why does he bring gold because he knows
[1:19:31] one thing this is the king
[1:19:36] this is the king he knows who who is
[1:19:38] between that little boy this is the king
[1:19:42] the second one has revelation two he
[1:19:44] brings mirror he said you will
[1:19:46] you will die for our sins
[1:19:50] and the third one what was the third
[1:19:51] fragrance fragrances
[1:19:54] fragrances exactly
[1:19:58] therefore i said donkey you understand
[1:19:59] why i said donkey yeah because it's very
[1:20:01] tricky america english can be very very
[1:20:03] tricky especially if you have the kind
[1:20:05] of a real german accent like me and that
[1:20:07] is always difficult okay i mean
[1:20:10] fragrances
[1:20:12] brought it there because you will have a
[1:20:14] life of service
[1:20:18] presence
[1:20:20] reveals the revelation of these three
[1:20:25] the way we treat the message of the hour
[1:20:28] shows our revelation
[1:20:33] can you say amen
[1:20:36] i mean i had some time a little boy
[1:20:40] i was new in the sunday school and we
[1:20:42] had some boys there coming like this to
[1:20:43] church
[1:20:45] organ
[1:20:47] and i did not know who the parents were
[1:20:49] i didn't dare to ask
[1:20:52] but one day i saw some people coming to
[1:20:54] the sanctuary
[1:20:58] i tell you the way we come they come
[1:21:02] where will they learn respect from us
[1:21:05] where will they learn love from us
[1:21:09] sometimes there's even ministers they
[1:21:10] cannot forget
[1:21:12] i said brother preaching is a gift but
[1:21:14] character is more than just a gift of
[1:21:16] good talking
[1:21:18] amen somehow cannot forgive some cannot
[1:21:21] ask for forgiveness it's ego it's a
[1:21:24] human pride brother we are we we have to
[1:21:26] make an example before that young
[1:21:28] generation
[1:21:30] that they can say i don't that they
[1:21:32] would say i don't understand the
[1:21:33] doctrine but i want to have what my
[1:21:35] father has
[1:21:36] what my mother has this is can you say
[1:21:39] amen amen
[1:21:41] blessed be the name of the lord and i
[1:21:43] know i'm talking from this wednesday
[1:21:45] evening to people
[1:21:47] he said brother mark is where i am in
[1:21:49] the picture i want to say one thing
[1:21:51] did you see his star
[1:21:52] can you say amen
[1:21:55] that you are one of these three
[1:21:58] they are portrayed in you
[1:22:00] we were one of those three that followed
[1:22:02] star
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:07] do we saw do we have we seen the other
[1:22:09] dimension
[1:22:10] that's right sure god was so great that
[1:22:13] he even showed the picture of brother
[1:22:15] branham
[1:22:16] with the pillar of fire
[1:22:17] we always say this is brother brandon
[1:22:19] was the pillar of fire brother ram said
[1:22:20] god wanted to make a picture of himself
[1:22:23] and he just allowed that i'm on the
[1:22:24] picture too
[1:22:27] that means we are we are those
[1:22:31] we are those those shepherds
[1:22:35] we were just in the things of the world

[1:22:41] we are those shepherds
[1:22:45] say brother marcus where are we no are
[1:22:47] we married
[1:22:49] who is married certainly that christ is
[1:22:52] born in our hearts

[1:22:58] in the manger of my heart
[1:23:02] so you are the manger
[1:23:06] you're mary you're the manger
[1:23:08] you are the shepherds you are the three
[1:23:10] astronomers
[1:23:13] you are joseph
[1:23:15] because you protect the message
[1:23:19] there's a quote of brother burns he said
[1:23:20] protect the message
[1:23:24] i tell you one thing
[1:23:26] one day rahab was protecting the
[1:23:28] messengers and brother bram said it was
[1:23:30] two tape boys
[1:23:32] later the message protected the family
[1:23:35] of rahab
[1:23:37] it matters to serve the lord
[1:23:41] god remembers yes
[1:23:44] and some of the young
[1:23:46] then you're the people who was in that
[1:23:48] in the in in that
[1:23:50] uh how he said
[1:23:52] in the in that christmas picture he said
[1:23:53] okay then i'm the donkey too that's fine
[1:23:57] but all these scriptures speak of
[1:24:00] us
[1:24:02] it's our story
[1:24:04] the bible became a new book
[1:24:08] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:24:11] hallelujah so where is the tent amen i
[1:24:14] don't know if this was the final answer
[1:24:16] to everything no i will not say but i
[1:24:19] believe this was one aspect
[1:24:21] please don't look there look there look
[1:24:24] there why don't you look here
[1:24:27] i will meet you
[1:24:28] there i will meet you here
[1:24:32] i'm it's the voice of your father
[1:24:34] if the musicians would come and
[1:24:36] hardly it was my great honor to just i
[1:24:38] had no notes
[1:24:42] the gesture but please okay
[1:24:44] do you have the nice song he's got it
[1:24:46] all in control
[1:24:48] he's got it uh
[1:24:50] oh i have a father that's very fine
[1:24:52] i have a
[1:24:55] or as the deer pants for the water
[1:24:58] is that fine if we have a song together
[1:25:00] you maybe see this sister that's fine
[1:25:06] only if it's fine for you brothers
[1:25:12] so
[1:25:12] let me finish by by by the last thought
[1:25:15] i put everything
[1:25:17] what what number is it sixth word which
[1:25:19] that which which song
[1:25:22] that's very nice
[1:25:24] you remember that brother brahms speak
[1:25:26] about
[1:25:27] the mighty man around david
[1:25:31] mighty in the message there's a man who
[1:25:33] can turn on the light
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:37] and he says these men were all gentiles
[1:25:40] and brother bremen gets excused he said
[1:25:42] they were not jews they were gentiles
[1:25:44] the mighty men they were fighters
[1:25:48] they were soldiers they were they were
[1:25:50] navy seals
[1:25:51] they
[1:25:52] came
[1:25:54] yeah
[1:25:56] many of you know don't know i was in as
[1:25:59] a boy i was in the french foreign legion
[1:26:00] i was a legionary for some time but god
[1:26:03] changed my heart
[1:26:05] god changed my heart for his glory amen
[1:26:08] they were fighters but they love david
[1:26:12] they love david love is not an emotion
[1:26:15] love is a substance
[1:26:19] and when david just said
[1:26:21] i wish to have a drink from the well in
[1:26:23] bethlehem he did not command
[1:26:25] he didn't know so you you you go
[1:26:29] but brother abraham said the least of
[1:26:31] his thoughts the least of his wishes
[1:26:33] were a command for david
[1:26:36] for these men because they were so much
[1:26:38] in love
[1:26:41] and when david came to his power
[1:26:44] all these men came into their power
[1:26:47] and here's what brother brahm said and
[1:26:50] this refers to you because you are one
[1:26:52] of these mighty men in this loudly
[1:26:55] seeing age
[1:26:56] to hold a stand
[1:26:58] is
[1:26:59] something very precious for god
[1:27:04] to live today a godly life is more
[1:27:07] difficult than ever before
[1:27:10] don't forget it
[1:27:12] amen you say brother marcus
[1:27:14] i i could not bring nobody to the lord i
[1:27:16] want to say you are the trophy
[1:27:19] you are the trophy
[1:27:21] right you bring yourself to the lord
[1:27:23] lest on the white throne judgment we
[1:27:25] will see
[1:27:27] how the bride can intercede into certain
[1:27:30] different situations
[1:27:32] we have a young
[1:27:33] brother in our church nobody comes to
[1:27:36] church nor his wife nor his children i
[1:27:38] said and you serve the lord
[1:27:40] because you will not help them by
[1:27:41] becoming worldly you serve the lord with
[1:27:43] all your heart and you will see them on
[1:27:45] the white throne judgment and you will
[1:27:46] be sitting there
[1:27:48] and there you will be an intercessor
[1:27:50] like esther
[1:27:51] but then brother brahman finished really
[1:27:53] about this he said this
[1:27:55] this man knew
[1:27:57] that david would come into power one day
[1:28:04] and let the world make fun of the
[1:28:06] message of this of this we know what it
[1:28:09] is
[1:28:11] can you say amen
[1:28:13] somebody some somebody
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:17] somebody wants to argue with me and
[1:28:19] brother branham you know brother marcus
[1:28:21] you know and and the ohio river bridge
[1:28:23] and so forth i said brother stop you
[1:28:25] come too late
[1:28:26] amen because i see the effect of this
[1:28:29] message in my life brother honestly you
[1:28:30] come too late
