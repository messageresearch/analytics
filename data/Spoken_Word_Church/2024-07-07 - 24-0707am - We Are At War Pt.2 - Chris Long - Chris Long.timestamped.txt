[0:06] this song as brother colleag gets ready
[0:08] to come no guilt in life no fear in
[0:15] death this is the power of
[0:18] Christ in me from life's first cry to
[0:25] final
[0:27] breath Jesus commands my
[0:31] [Music]
[0:32] Destiny no power of
[0:35] hell no scheme of
[0:38] man could ever
[0:41] pluck me from his hand till he returns
[0:47] or calls me
[0:50] home this is the power of
[0:54] Christ stand
[0:56] [Music]
[1:09] I
[1:11] Vis
[1:13] sister father she standing about the in
[1:15] at a church was small maybe not that
[1:19] small but that's small and I came up on
[1:23] a Sunday
[1:24] night first
[1:27] time was one black
[1:31] man in the
[1:33] church he didn't stay too
[1:36] [Laughter]
[1:38] long but you know and I think of the
[1:44] people the bapti me in the name of Jesus
[1:47] Christ was a different place from
[1:50] here but they had met brother Dale and
[1:54] he had talked to them one of them pull
[1:58] his whole church out of a
[2:00] Methodist
[2:02] conference but he he stayed for a
[2:06] while then he got to the place that
[2:10] he would not give the prophet credit or
[2:13] guard of pro credit he wanted it to be
[2:17] his
[2:18] own he he lost his mind by doing
[2:23] so and he got to the place that he would
[2:26] not even speak to us anymore
[2:30] but uh it's all about
[2:33] God it's not about one
[2:36] person or one church it's God Alone amen
[2:44] so but I I watched this grow people have
[2:49] come and people have
[2:51] left but God still remain the
[2:54] same and that's what we have to depend
[2:57] on
[2:59] we're going to read this morning

[37:29] blood amen that's what's holding us this
[37:32] morning God bless you
[37:34] all greet you in the name of the Lord a
[37:36] pleasure to be in the house of the Lord
[37:38] with
[37:39] you I think I got a confirmation this
[37:41] morning the brother read psalms
[37:44] 27 I don't think it was here yesterday
[37:47] and that's the scripture I opened with
[37:49] brother yesterday so we just ride online
[37:52] right in track I think what I'd like to
[37:55] do this morning I don't need to
[37:56] introduce myself no I think we just get
[37:59] right into the
[38:00] word uh of course I'll I'll I'll take as
[38:03] much time as necessary but you all have
[38:06] learned by now that uh I don't try to
[38:08] stretch it out any further than I can
[38:10] but uh we'll let the Lord lead this
[38:13] morning and I think what I probably
[38:15] should do on the advice of my wife is
[38:17] finish reading the rest of the scripture
[38:19] in Hebrews
[38:21] 4:12 she said honey I only got to the
[38:24] word Quicken I said well it was made
[38:27] alive right then and I couldn't do
[38:28] anything else with
[38:30] it it was quickened to me amen so
[38:35] Hebrews 412 and I don't want to borrow a
[38:39] pair of glasses cuz I know where they'll
[38:40] come from I got some over there in my
[38:44] briefcase but I'll just we'll just read
[38:46] it the way it is Hebrews 4:12 you got it
[38:48] say amen amen for the word of God is
[38:53] quick and
[38:55] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[38:59] sword piercing even to the dividing a
[39:03] suer of Soul and Spirit and of the
[39:07] joints and Marrow and is a discerner of
[39:10] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[39:13] let us pray father that is the most
[39:16] powerful weapon Lord you could have
[39:19] possibly given any one of us father if
[39:22] we read that scripture we find out Lord
[39:25] that this sword that you have given us
[39:29] father to use is so powerful it's quick
[39:33] it's lifegiving Lord it it knows how to
[39:37] divide the word rightly Lord even
[39:40] between the soul the marrow the joints
[39:43] Lord every bit every piece every part
[39:47] and then to top it off father it becomes
[39:50] the
[39:51] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[39:54] the
[39:55] heart that's what we're ask asking for
[39:58] this morning
[40:00] Lord take this sword father I
[40:03] pray and place it in the hand of strong
[40:07] faith to bring it to the heart of the
[40:09] enemy
[40:11] father Lord that's our desire we know
[40:13] we're in a battle Yeah and we're willing
[40:16] and
[40:17] able and anxious Lord now to fight for
[40:20] you amen it's always for your honor and
[40:24] your glory
[40:25] father let us cut the enemy me down this
[40:27] morning
[40:29] father let us see ourselves Lord through
[40:32] your word for who you said we are it's
[40:37] it's not father that we could be or
[40:39] should be but we are amen we are now yes
[40:43] the Sons and Daughters of
[40:45] God for your honor and your glory father
[40:48] we stand here this
[40:51] morning as sister Regina father
[40:55] sang I'm a nobody
[40:59] trying to tell
[41:01] everybody about
[41:03] somebody which is you in Jesus name amen
[41:08] God bless you may be
[41:09] seated now brothers and sisters that
[41:11] that did I want you to I want you to
[41:13] consider before we go f any further I
[41:15] just going to give you part two of we're
[41:17] at War amen this is the greatest battle
[41:21] ever fought whether you realize it or
[41:23] not and many of us this morning of
[41:26] course are fighting our own battles and
[41:27] as I as I tried to uh turn the corner
[41:31] yesterday and present to you the fact
[41:33] that it's time for us to stop fighting
[41:36] amongst ourselves and with ourselves and
[41:39] for
[41:40] ourselves I'll tell you why God is made
[41:43] a way now God implemented his Plan of
[41:46] Salvation so that you and I could enter
[41:48] into the
[41:50] battl we know the battle started in
[41:52] heaven am according to Revelations 12
[41:57] there was a battle that started in
[41:58] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[42:00] against the devil and his angels is that
[42:04] right and and and and we and and then
[42:07] here's the deal I I I I'm going to say
[42:09] it like this for for a segue into this
[42:13] morning's message and prevailed not the
[42:16] Bible says and they prevailed not so
[42:18] there was like a a
[42:20] standoff was a
[42:23] stalemate it's like when you're playing
[42:25] chess and in each in each player has got
[42:28] has got the king yeah uh in check but
[42:32] check made is what you're looking for
[42:35] righten does that make any sense God
[42:38] Made You and I as his bride
[42:43] co-responsible so while there is a mate
[42:46] he has allowed someone to move them
[42:49] chest pieces into position to make it a
[42:55] Checkmate that's the BR of Jesus
[42:59] Christ you know it's the king that's
[43:02] being protected on the chessboard but
[43:04] the peace on the chessboard that has the
[43:06] most movement that has the most power
[43:09] come on brother is the
[43:12] Queen the queen can move in any
[43:15] direction up and down and diagonal back
[43:18] and
[43:19] forth she's put on that board to protect
[43:23] the king amen hallelujah amen and our
[43:26] King see this
[43:28] morning is the word of God
[43:31] amen amen God and His word are one amen
[43:35] you hear it all the time you hear us
[43:38] make as Ministers of the word of God
[43:40] make emphasis constantly and I know you
[43:43] hear it here that the word is the
[43:46] Difference
[43:48] Maker we've come to a point in time
[43:51] where there will be no
[43:55] history come on because it's all about
[43:59] now and the
[44:01] future but the prophet of God pointed
[44:03] out to us that What man does is he
[44:06] occupies his time with looking back to
[44:09] see how things were and looking forward
[44:13] to how things might be but always
[44:16] forgetting about what is
[44:20] now according to the Bible our faith
[44:24] should be now Faith amen amen amen cuz
[44:29] that's a scripture now
[44:33] Faith amen so brothers and sisters let's
[44:36] deal with today but God gave us his word
[44:39] we're creatures of time he's not a
[44:42] creature of
[44:43] time as I mentioned yesterday I I want
[44:46] you to begin
[44:50] to understand through the word of God
[44:53] the message of our hour because the
[44:56] prophet of God emphasizes that it's the
[44:59] message of your hour spiritual food and
[45:02] due season that is going to make the
[45:05] difference for you and I again we can
[45:08] look back or we can look forward but
[45:11] spiritual food in due season is the key
[45:14] and God's word changes
[45:17] not but what does change is the time the
[45:22] age the
[45:24] dispensation and the revelation
[45:27] and the intensity of
[45:30] it we're in a
[45:34] battle right no question about
[45:38] that what are we fighting
[45:41] over what are we fighting for what's the
[45:46] cause well according to
[45:50] Jude and Jude has one
[45:53] chapter I guess I don't even know if you
[45:56] call it a chap
[45:58] chapter
[45:59] Jude says
[46:03] this in verses 5 and
[46:06] six I will therefore put you in
[46:12] remembrance so here we're going to go
[46:14] back okay though you once knew this
[46:19] right amen where did we get this
[46:22] information
[46:24] from how did we want want know what Jude
[46:29] is going to remind us of right we were
[46:34] in him before the foundation of the
[46:38] world right now you and I are told we
[46:42] don't remember that but what Jude is
[46:46] doing here is he's taking a people that
[46:50] have been
[46:52] conditioned amen sir
[46:59] to have amnesia y That's Right
[47:04] am amen right amen God's word is here to
[47:09] declare to
[47:11] you who we
[47:14] are where we came
[47:17] from and where we're
[47:20] going that will cure Amnesia every
[47:25] time because we B P our
[47:29] theophany so we're we're we're we're
[47:31] we're like looking through a glass
[47:35] Darkly but we've come to the place in
[47:38] the journey where now it's face to face
[47:43] according to what Paul taught that's
[47:45] right amen listen now I will therefore
[47:48] put you in remembrance though you once
[47:51] knew this how that the Lord having saved
[47:56] the people uhuh out of the land of
[48:01] Egypt
[48:03] afterward destroyed them that believe
[48:07] not so you see he's a gracious God and
[48:11] he wants everybody saved but not
[48:16] everybody follows the pathway of the
[48:20] prescription of his
[48:22] salvation he paid the price but you and
[48:25] I have to to take the claim all right
[48:29] there's where the battle is amen now
[48:31] what claim what what do we have claim on
[48:35] it's an inheritance right it was given
[48:38] to you and I before the foundation of
[48:41] the world by God when he placed our
[48:45] names in the Lamb's Book of
[48:49] Life I'm just repeating the Bible to you
[48:52] y all should know that right okay
[48:54] without reading every scripture watch
[48:57] here the battle started in
[49:00] heaven and what it was was not a battle
[49:04] with guns and knives and Hand
[49:07] Grenades and and and fighter
[49:11] jets and
[49:13] tanks and
[49:15] artillery it was a war of words right
[49:19] amen Michael and his angels weren't
[49:21] using literal
[49:24] swords clanging them together and Spears
[49:27] and Shields and
[49:29] knives it was a battle between Michael
[49:33] and his angels angels are
[49:37] messengers and the devil and his
[49:41] angels it was a war of
[49:48] words all right you still with
[49:52] me verse six
[49:54] says and the angel
[49:57] s which kept not their first
[50:02] estate this word right here is where the
[50:05] word real estate comes from which we
[50:09] find ourselves preoccupied with yeah
[50:12] right the American
[50:15] dream my
[50:17] patch this my home this my town this is
[50:22] my
[50:23] street amen you think it is
[50:27] yeah that's right
[50:28] brother when the folks in charge decide
[50:31] they want
[50:33] it you may die defending
[50:38] it and just to find out it's not really
[50:42] yours no brother my property's paid
[50:46] off just stop paying your
[50:50] taxes you see we're in a battle amen and
[50:54] I'm I I'm I'm anticipating brothers and
[51:00] sisters that we have spent far too long
[51:05] focusing on the
[51:09] tangible agree
[51:14] amen
[51:18] listen when
[51:22] faith is the substance of thing hoped
[51:25] for the evidence of Things Not
[51:31] Seen have you ever looked up the word
[51:34] faith in the dictionary it it says in
[51:37] your dictionary a
[51:40] belief in something for which there is
[51:44] no proof amen right
[51:47] amen that is absolutely
[51:51] contrary to everything that you and I
[51:54] have been raised for right
[51:59] am on this Earth
[52:03] amen but
[52:05] Abraham the father of the
[52:09] faithful caught a glimpse of something
[52:11] that you and
[52:13] I have before us every
[52:17] detail Abraham found himself wandering
[52:22] around the
[52:24] countryside looking for for a city whose
[52:28] Builder and maker was not man amen
[52:31] that's right amen amen H Abraham never
[52:36] found that City in a tangible
[52:40] sense but Abraham knew it
[52:43] existed he could not see it with the
[52:46] natural
[52:48] eye brothers and sisters we're we're in
[52:51] a fight
[52:55] today but we're not fighting flesh and
[52:57] blood as we found out yesterday
[53:00] amen but we're fighting principalities
[53:03] and Powers spiritual wickedness in high
[53:07] places amen amen that's it some of us
[53:10] though are preoccupied with fighting in
[53:16] ourselves I can assure you this morning
[53:18] that there are folks in
[53:22] here that right now this very minute
[53:27] are arguing with themselves
[53:30] y I don't want to be here I'm tired I'm
[53:35] bored I'm this I'm that I'm the other
[53:40] thing and then once we have gotten worn
[53:44] down in that
[53:46] battle we start to think about the guy
[53:50] next to
[53:52] me or the lady in front of me or the guy
[53:56] behind behind the pulpit right it's a
[54:01] battle and as long as you and I
[54:05] stay in that particular
[54:09] battle will'll never be winners that's
[54:13] right we'll never get the
[54:16] victory it's to him that overcometh
[54:21] amen what are we overcoming
[54:25] ourselves Hallelujah and once we have
[54:28] won that battle and we have claimed that
[54:31] Victory and we understand that that
[54:35] enemy has been
[54:37] destroyed God can now use us but we
[54:41] serve a particular God the god that you
[54:45] and I
[54:47] serve has said once you have beat
[54:52] yourself I'll take over
[54:57] amen amen Second
[55:03] Chronicles chapter
[55:07] 20 verse 15 and he said here can ye all
[55:13] Judah and ye inhabitants of
[55:17] Jerusalem and Thou King ah
[55:22] Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto
[55:25] you be Be not Afraid nor dismayed by
[55:30] reason of this great multitude we know
[55:33] we talked yesterday about a brother a
[55:35] minister who decided to uh kind of do
[55:39] some math and he took the 200,000,000
[55:42] demons let out on in the river Euphrates
[55:46] in the Book of Revelations yes oh yeah
[55:49] and any kind of narrowed it down using
[55:52] some of the statistics that brother
[55:53] brandom gave you know like one in a
[55:56] milli I yeah and then divide that one
[55:59] and a million amongst how many
[56:01] Christians are on the planet today I
[56:04] don't know it's a small number
[56:06] absolutely brother amen right it could
[56:09] be 10,000 it could be 5,000 it could be
[56:13] 700 I didn't finish yesterday with
[56:16] Gideon my wife said it's
[56:19] 300 started with 32,000 and God said too
[56:24] many amen yes
[56:26] weed out 22,000 right away got 10,000
[56:30] left he said too
[56:33] many that's right got down to
[56:37] 300 amen and the odds of those 300
[56:42] facing that Army seemed insurmountable
[56:47] abut but
[56:49] God right here says
[56:54] this be not Afra afraid nor
[57:00] dismayed
[57:02] by reason of this great
[57:06] multitude for the battle is not
[57:10] yours
[57:13] Hallelujah but
[57:15] God so brothers and sisters I'm here to
[57:19] remind you and encourage you and
[57:23] cheerlead you on this morning that let
[57:26] you hurry up and finish the battle with
[57:29] yourself so that then God can come into
[57:32] the picture and he will take over the
[57:37] battle cuz there ain't no way you and I
[57:40] are going to whoop the Devil Without
[57:44] God but God has instrumentally given you
[57:48] and I the most powerful weapon that God
[57:53] himself uses amen amen yes if we want
[57:57] the battle to be God's then we got to
[58:00] take
[58:01] on God's way of doing it amen he's using
[58:06] you and I in this battle but what he
[58:10] wants from you and I is total
[58:15] surrender we're going into a fight the
[58:18] whole point is yes he wants you to
[58:22] surrender to him so that he can fight
[58:25] for you he can fight with you and he can
[58:29] fight in
[58:31] you that's true Victory brothers and
[58:34] sisters
[58:35] God yes

[58:57] what confidence right you say well
[59:00] brother what if I make a mistake how can
[59:05] you you get that Holy Spirit down in
[59:09] your soul which is the response of the
[59:13] deep calling to the
[59:15] deep and what you've got is a
[59:20] sure word of
[59:23] Prophecy how do we know that cuz God
[59:26] told us that the
[59:28] author of the word of God which is our
[59:33] weapon the sword of Hebrew
[59:37] 412 is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's
[59:41] the author of the word amen the holy
[59:46] spirit is the
[59:48] summation of the offices of god father
[59:52] son the Holy Ghost I've said this
[59:55] thousands of times but one of these days
[59:58] brothers and sisters it's going to take
[59:59] heart this is going to take life in you
[1:00:02] amen it's one God in three offices just
[1:00:07] like you and me
[1:00:10] amen I'm a father I'm a son but I am
[1:00:16] me Hallelujah in the office of a father
[1:00:19] I look down to my children and I give
[1:00:22] them as much advice and as love and
[1:00:27] encouragement and and and and uh and
[1:00:30] whatever it takes to make them
[1:00:32] successful right right that's the office
[1:00:34] of a father or a
[1:00:38] mother that same guy the same guy that's
[1:00:42] expected to lead his children into a
[1:00:45] successful life the same guy has to turn
[1:00:49] when his father comes and say yes
[1:00:53] sir no sir right even if you disagree
[1:00:57] come on come on you don't when I was
[1:01:01] just 12 or 13 age of accountability I'd
[1:01:04] say in my mind well my dad was giving me
[1:01:06] a talking
[1:01:07] to I know more than he
[1:01:11] does in my mind I you say that to your
[1:01:14] dad out loud and it's going to get
[1:01:17] worse at least in my family it would
[1:01:20] have got
[1:01:21] worse but you know how it is come on
[1:01:23] young people just
[1:01:26] my mama don't know what she's talking
[1:01:30] about my daddy just don't know what I'm
[1:01:32] going
[1:01:35] through but we do yes amen because of
[1:01:39] the offices yes right a
[1:01:44] father and child mother child you
[1:01:48] understand
[1:01:51] okay but what about
[1:01:54] you what about when it comes com down to
[1:01:57] you that's right amen that's the holy
[1:02:00] spirit amen the holy spirit is the part
[1:02:03] of God that's here
[1:02:05] amen and he wants to have he wants you
[1:02:09] and I to have him worse than we want
[1:02:14] him he's worked his whole plan so that
[1:02:18] you and I can become
[1:02:23] him and he and his word are one and that
[1:02:28] is the weapon that he's given us Amen to
[1:02:33] defeat every
[1:02:38] enemy but we spend so much time starting
[1:02:40] with
[1:02:41] ourselves God has made it so simple for
[1:02:44] you and I to overcome
[1:02:47] ourselves even our
[1:02:51] faith that's right if we put our faith
[1:02:54] in God's word like the examples that God
[1:02:58] gave us in this
[1:03:00] Bible I'm using Joshua because Joshua is
[1:03:04] a type of the Holy Spirit today Joshua
[1:03:08] is so
[1:03:11] close that even his
[1:03:13] name mean Jehovah savior amen right yeah
[1:03:17] that's right now Joshua is not Jehovah
[1:03:21] savior but he was a type of Jehovah
[1:03:24] savior right he was a type of Jesus
[1:03:28] Christ Jesus
[1:03:31] Christ was is and always will be God
[1:03:38] amen amen manifest In the Flesh
[1:03:41] amen and he did what he did so you and I
[1:03:46] could be
[1:03:49] him
[1:03:51] right that's why it's a
[1:03:54] battle because the devil don't want you
[1:03:57] right to be him the devil wants you to
[1:04:01] be the
[1:04:03] devil you say oh brother that's harsh he
[1:04:06] is the most religious guy on the
[1:04:12] planet that's right we all paint the
[1:04:14] devil like he's down there in the
[1:04:16] witches Coen and the warlocks cave
[1:04:19] dancing around the the pentagram
[1:04:23] yeah yeah he got a turned around round
[1:04:26] collar back in a Bible cuz he
[1:04:30] knows that that's where Authority yes
[1:04:34] and he's what he wants to be is he wants
[1:04:37] to be a Creator his brother Wade and now
[1:04:39] we're talk he there's only one
[1:04:41] difference between the devil and
[1:04:46] God the devil can't
[1:04:52] create it's one of the very reasons why
[1:04:54] a lot of people Stu stumbled over our
[1:04:56] Prophet
[1:04:58] absolutely because God allowed
[1:05:01] him as a reference for you and
[1:05:05] I to bring something into existence that
[1:05:09] wasn't there
[1:05:12] before now to you and I it seems silly
[1:05:14] they was just
[1:05:18] squirrels they were brought in they were
[1:05:21] brought as Hebrews 11:2 says out of
[1:05:26] nothing amen amen that's why thank you
[1:05:30] sister
[1:05:32] Regina for letting me be nothing
[1:05:37] amen right amen CU Let Me Tell You Folks
[1:05:40] something that's where God
[1:05:44] finds what he's looking for yes
[1:05:47] [Applause]
[1:05:54] sir remember something about
[1:05:57] God he don't need our
[1:06:02] dirt you know the story everybody's
[1:06:05] heard it a thousand times for that one
[1:06:07] person in here who ain't heard
[1:06:10] it you know go ahead the scientist Satan
[1:06:15] says I can do
[1:06:18] that I can bring that into
[1:06:21] existence God's like you know I was I
[1:06:25] think I was talking
[1:06:27] to the angel of the Lord you ever know
[1:06:29] this the angel of the Lord has anybody
[1:06:31] ever seen a reference that the angel of
[1:06:33] the Lord
[1:06:35] smiled I haven't seen one I mean I'm not
[1:06:37] saying it ain't there but when the
[1:06:39] prophet explains the angel of the Lord
[1:06:41] he's always kind of
[1:06:44] stern right he could even get upset in a
[1:06:48] way not not not mad like you and me but
[1:06:52] you know when brother Brandon was in
[1:06:53] Africa y and he went and let them fellas
[1:06:57] talk him into something that God told
[1:06:58] him you go here you go with Sydney
[1:07:01] Jackson I'll take care of you he let
[1:07:04] them mey mouth preachers talk him into
[1:07:07] nope you be hitchhiking and then Billy
[1:07:11] Paul said Daddy how we going to get
[1:07:13] home I would have
[1:07:17] went but we wouldn't have known that see
[1:07:20] unless God had sent an example for us
[1:07:23] and showed us what the results would be
[1:07:26] if you choose a different
[1:07:28] way brother brandham nearly
[1:07:32] died and the angel of the Lord told him
[1:07:35] I told you not to do
[1:07:37] that he kind of give us the reference of
[1:07:40] him and or man
[1:07:41] Neville brother Neville could
[1:07:45] class just calm down
[1:07:48] now you're going to go to your corner if
[1:07:50] you don't
[1:07:51] behave
[1:07:53] Johnny sit down
[1:07:56] brother brandham said Oran Neville
[1:07:58] wasn't made like brother brandham that's
[1:08:00] right the angel of the Lord said Johnny
[1:08:04] sit
[1:08:06] down that's the God we serve he wants
[1:08:08] you and I to be so right so often amen
[1:08:12] right that he will do whatever is
[1:08:14] necessary to bring you and I so look if
[1:08:17] you're having a rough time this
[1:08:20] morning just throw them hands
[1:08:23] up and I mean sincerely in your heart
[1:08:25] say Lord I'm
[1:08:28] through I give up I don't want to battle
[1:08:32] anymore and God says I'll do it now I'll
[1:08:35] take the battle from you I'll fight for
[1:08:38] you all you got to do is surrender to me
[1:08:42] seems odd that we're surrendering while
[1:08:45] we're
[1:08:46] fighting I mean if you go to Hebrews and
[1:08:49] read the chapter the few verses before
[1:08:51] Hebrews
[1:08:52] 4:12 he's talking about rest brother
[1:08:55] amen and then he says labor wait a
[1:08:58] minute I thought we was resting labor
[1:09:00] rest labor
[1:09:04] rest we're resting in
[1:09:07] him Let Me Tell You Folks something we
[1:09:09] ain't ever going to rest the way you and
[1:09:12] I think we're going to rest God tried it
[1:09:16] once after he made everything he rested
[1:09:18] on the seventh day then the fall
[1:09:20] happened he had to get back up and go to
[1:09:23] work amen amen amen come
[1:09:27] on
[1:09:29] Amen but when he got back up to go to
[1:09:32] work he wanted to work through you and
[1:09:34] me amen God don't labor the way you and
[1:09:38] I labor God don't strain oh let there be
[1:09:44] light
[1:09:46] no God said let there be light amen and
[1:09:50] he did not keep looking around to see
[1:09:52] where the light was coming from he went
[1:09:54] to the next stage of the journey knowing
[1:09:57] that when he said it light was
[1:10:00] coming how would you like to have that
[1:10:03] same Authority that same ability that
[1:10:06] same confidence in what you say well
[1:10:09] I'll tell you right now that we're told
[1:10:11] by the prophet of God that you have thus
[1:10:15] saith the
[1:10:17] Lord but the key right there is it's not
[1:10:20] thus saith Chris long or Wayde Dale or
[1:10:24] William brandom or the
[1:10:27] pope or you or it's thus saith the Lord
[1:10:32] or she keeps quiet and when the seventh
[1:10:37] seal opened there was silence in heaven
[1:10:41] about the space of half an hour why
[1:10:43] because it wasn't
[1:10:48] time for the bride of
[1:10:50] Christ to
[1:10:53] receive but God opened that
[1:10:56] seal so that one man that's right could
[1:10:59] come in contact with what God has in
[1:11:02] store for you and I amen and then he
[1:11:05] closed it up again he opened it and
[1:11:08] omitted it the Bible says right and to
[1:11:11] Omit something is to either not allow it
[1:11:15] to exist or to put it on
[1:11:19] hold until the time was
[1:11:23] right brothers and sisters you may not
[1:11:26] realize this but the seventh
[1:11:28] seal has been relegated by God to a
[1:11:32] specific group of people that's the
[1:11:35] reason why I'm preaching the way I am it
[1:11:37] got down to
[1:11:39] 300 in the days of
[1:11:42] Gideon amen there was only two as
[1:11:45] brother Michael T pointed out you say
[1:11:48] what about Moses Moses was told by God
[1:11:53] that he was going to lead the children
[1:11:55] of Israel into the promised land that's
[1:11:58] in the
[1:12:01] Bible but Moses thought the battle was
[1:12:05] his and he got
[1:12:08] annoyed with the children of Israel and
[1:12:10] smoke the rock
[1:12:14] twice you and I don't have to Smite The
[1:12:17] Rock not even one time CU it's already
[1:12:22] been opened there's a fountain already
[1:12:26] open in the House of David excuse me
[1:12:30] brother sir I better back
[1:12:35] up we're in a battle
[1:12:38] amen amen but brothers and sisters it's
[1:12:42] not our
[1:12:44] battle you can this morning you can stop
[1:12:48] fighting with yourself right now amen
[1:12:52] give yourself over Amen to the
[1:12:56] sacrifice of the blood of Christ
[1:12:59] accepted in your heart and you become
[1:13:02] just like every other person that has
[1:13:05] done the same thing but what people
[1:13:09] start doing is they start thinking I got
[1:13:12] to do
[1:13:16] something and you do have something to
[1:13:21] do having done all to stand
[1:13:26] stand stand at your post of Duty because
[1:13:29] the angels that were in the battle the
[1:13:32] war of words in heaven between Michael
[1:13:36] and his Messengers Michael and his
[1:13:39] preachers y amen and Lucifer and his
[1:13:42] Messengers Lucifer and his preachers
[1:13:44] they didn't keep their first estate they
[1:13:47] refused to occupy the spot that God gave
[1:13:52] them in the beginning
[1:13:58] amen and that's where their leader went
[1:14:00] wrong
[1:14:01] yeah brother way and I were talking I
[1:14:03] said think about
[1:14:06] Lucifer
[1:14:08] perfect can I say it again perfect Who
[1:14:12] Wants to Be
[1:14:14] Perfect watch now watch watch the next
[1:14:17] one don't raise your hand cuz it's a
[1:14:18] trick
[1:14:20] question who thinks they're perfect
[1:14:22] already
[1:14:25] he got to
[1:14:27] thinking perfect in all my
[1:14:33] ways I can't
[1:14:36] create I have to borrow his
[1:14:44] dirt you know the
[1:14:47] story well I can do that all right go
[1:14:51] ahead
[1:14:52] uh hang on just a second I'll I'll be
[1:14:55] right back where you going I'm going
[1:14:58] outside to get me a little cup full of
[1:14:59] dirt he said you get your own dirt if
[1:15:02] you're going to do like me you can't use
[1:15:04] my dirt you get you make your own dirt
[1:15:09] come on look at what science is trying
[1:15:10] to do
[1:15:13] today brother bradam said they stumble
[1:15:15] over a blade of
[1:15:18] grass just a simple blade of grass oh
[1:15:21] but my wife and I have a piece a patch
[1:15:25] we live in the mountains where grass
[1:15:27] don't grow too Rocky too many pine trees
[1:15:30] too many pine needles I got a real nice
[1:15:33] patch of grass brother Lise I never have
[1:15:35] to mow
[1:15:36] it you can all use it here in Georgia
[1:15:39] because you got a lot of mowing to do I
[1:15:40] can tell when I'm driving down the
[1:15:42] highway it's artificial yeah
[1:15:47] right another
[1:15:52] battle did you know
[1:15:56] that we are fighting the same fight that
[1:15:58] Joshua
[1:16:00] Fought the Battle of AI
[1:16:04] right you you think it's a
[1:16:06] coincidence God already knew that man
[1:16:09] was going to try to come up through the
[1:16:12] Church of Satan and use artificial
[1:16:14] intelligence well I got to tell you
[1:16:16] folks something AI is not artificial
[1:16:18] intelligence it's almost intelligent
[1:16:21] that's right
[1:16:25] yeah think about it
[1:16:29] artificial
[1:16:30] intelligence
[1:16:32] Joshua already fought that battle but
[1:16:37] the problem with AI is you have to bring
[1:16:40] something from your past or the history
[1:16:46] of mankind and bring it over into God's
[1:16:50] word don't work don't
[1:16:53] work if you read your Bible you'll find
[1:16:57] out that achen did
[1:16:59] not take the accursed thing from
[1:17:03] AI it never got that far as soon as they
[1:17:06] started battling an AI and they started
[1:17:09] losing church members right away right
[1:17:12] away brother Donnie Joshua said hold it
[1:17:16] the holy spirit says stop right here
[1:17:19] right now God told me that we wouldn't
[1:17:22] lose a man and we'll destroy the enemy
[1:17:28] stop are you
[1:17:30] willing to take the advice of the Holy
[1:17:33] Spirit and as soon as you start to lose
[1:17:36] some of that Faith some of that fervor
[1:17:39] and some of that action some of that
[1:17:41] some of that oh man I I remember how it
[1:17:44] used to
[1:17:46] be stop right
[1:17:49] there because I'm going to tell you
[1:17:50] what's going on like achen you're gonna
[1:17:54] you're gonna reach back into
[1:17:58] Jericho right CU that's where the ours
[1:18:01] thing came from aen didn't steal from AI
[1:18:04] he harbored something from the previous
[1:18:06] battle you see he brought something over
[1:18:10] from The Battle Before and he hit it in
[1:18:13] his tent thinking I I got away with it
[1:18:16] right I got me a a wedge of gold a
[1:18:20] little silver and think about the types
[1:18:22] gold deity silver Redemption and then
[1:18:25] but but but where did he make his H I
[1:18:27] got me a Babylonian garment you get rid
[1:18:29] of that thing right now yeah amen the
[1:18:33] gold and the silver have a place in
[1:18:36] God's economy if you'll receive it
[1:18:38] correctly don't steal
[1:18:41] it don't reach back into somebody or
[1:18:44] yours past or the last Church you went
[1:18:47] to or what you used to believe and try
[1:18:49] to bring it over in to the Battle of AI
[1:18:54] right it'll end up
[1:18:56] artificial
[1:18:58] right right you know what AI means in
[1:19:00] the Bible it doesn't mean artificial
[1:19:02] intelligence it means heap of
[1:19:06] ruins amen what a
[1:19:09] mess Jericho means like a land of
[1:19:13] fragrance so you remember you know
[1:19:16] smells trigger things did you know that
[1:19:18] I mean everybody in here I remember that
[1:19:21] smell right there that's in an Out
[1:19:23] Burger yeah
[1:19:26] that's what a burger H oh I remember
[1:19:30] that smell from when I was a child we
[1:19:31] used
[1:19:32] to bring bring it back to you like a
[1:19:35] song get them songs out of your
[1:19:38] head it's
[1:19:40] impossible so what you got to do is you
[1:19:42] got to replace them don't bring them up
[1:19:43] from the
[1:19:45] past you got to replace them that's why
[1:19:48] I wanted sister Regina to sing for me
[1:19:50] this morning cuz you got to replace them
[1:19:52] old
[1:19:53] songs Don't reach back and try to bring
[1:19:56] one over you know that's what Satan
[1:20:00] does in the gospel music he reached back
[1:20:03] into the rhythm and blues and the rock
[1:20:05] and roll and he brought it right over
[1:20:06] into here well the words are about
[1:20:11] Jesus where did the beat come
[1:20:14] from and the and the beat goes
[1:20:17] on come on now see we've got to come to
[1:20:22] a place brothers and sisters where we
[1:20:24] forget those things which are behind
[1:20:28] us press toward the Mark it's a battle
[1:20:32] Paul said I fought a good fight am amen
[1:20:36] and it's a fight of faith I kept the
[1:20:39] faith he said yes sir amen that's what
[1:20:42] we're contending with this morning
[1:20:43] brothers and
[1:20:44] sisters you say well brother Chris this
[1:20:47] this don't seem to be much message it is
[1:20:49] the
[1:20:52] message it is the message
[1:20:57] this message is not predicated on how
[1:20:59] much you can quote how many drawings you
[1:21:01] can put on a chalkboard how many graphs
[1:21:04] and charts you can make they're fine
[1:21:05] Brother B said those things are
[1:21:08] fine but what it really boils down to
[1:21:11] your
[1:21:13] faith can you put unadulterated 100%
[1:21:18] confidence in God's word that's the 300
[1:21:22] that's the two yeah amen
[1:21:25] amen right amen Moses was told since he
[1:21:29] was in that little basket he was
[1:21:32] probably being talked to brother and he
[1:21:34] didn't even know what the words meant a
[1:21:36] little baby were floating him into the
[1:21:38] can you imagine if he could think like
[1:21:40] an adult what am I doing out here in
[1:21:43] this crocodile
[1:21:45] swamp
[1:21:47] right mom why are you pushing me out
[1:21:49] into the crocodiles
[1:21:55] but his mama
[1:21:58] knew the church
[1:22:02] knew you can't be harmed no
[1:22:08] right it was confirmed to her and her
[1:22:11] husband that Moses was the deliverer
[1:22:14] Moses didn't even know he was the
[1:22:15] deliverer and the deliverer was floating
[1:22:17] through the
[1:22:20] crocodiles God had purposed it yes cuz
[1:22:23] look at the way it end ended up that
[1:22:26] little cradle them them crocodiles might
[1:22:28] have been up there bumping it with their
[1:22:29] nose they didn't even know they were
[1:22:31] steering it to Pharaoh's
[1:22:35] do and little little Miriam in the in
[1:22:38] the in the bull rush is watching it oh
[1:22:41] oh it ended up right there at the court
[1:22:43] of Pharaoh's daughter she ran back and
[1:22:45] told her mama y think about this this is
[1:22:49] Pharaoh's
[1:22:51] house and Moses's mom yaked was like a
[1:22:55] Hebrew
[1:22:57] slave
[1:22:58] right but Pharaoh's daughter wasn't
[1:23:04] lactating so there was a
[1:23:08] problem how in the world did they end up
[1:23:12] picking Moses's mom brother this is the
[1:23:15] God we serve see I'm preaching this way
[1:23:18] because I want your confidence to be
[1:23:19] built solely on God's word not the
[1:23:24] preach
[1:23:25] not the pastor not the prophet God's
[1:23:27] word but the
[1:23:28] prophet is God's
[1:23:31] mouthpiece right that's right amen I
[1:23:34] believe that with all my heart that's
[1:23:36] why constantly prophets are mistaken
[1:23:38] yeah for God because God is speaking
[1:23:43] through them they're an
[1:23:47] instrument being used by God to declare

[1:28:08] and blood
[1:28:09] Affair no flesh and blood cannot inherit
[1:28:12] as we said yesterday right no it can so
[1:28:15] why are we spending so much time on

[1:29:07] my life is a
[1:29:09] compromise so is
[1:29:11] Abraham's that's right we wouldn't have
[1:29:14] known this because the Bible tells us
[1:29:17] Abraham stagger not that's right think
[1:29:20] about Abraham he stagger not he got a he
[1:29:23] got you got a relationship with God
[1:29:26] there briefly and then it was follow
[1:29:28] him Abraham where are you going come on
[1:29:30] I want everybody in the room to put
[1:29:32] yourself if God came to you today and he
[1:29:35] told you to leave your home leave your
[1:29:38] family and go somewhere but he didn't
[1:29:41] tell you where you was going you just
[1:29:42] try to explain that to your
[1:29:45] family where you going he's gone
[1:29:49] crazy come on that's what we it's gone
[1:29:52] nuts
[1:29:55] the guy's telling us that God's talking
[1:29:56] to him and God told him to go somewhere
[1:29:58] and he don't even know where he's going
[1:29:59] no he
[1:30:00] did Abraham
[1:30:03] amen but what he did know is God talked
[1:30:05] to
[1:30:07] him and from that point on it didn't
[1:30:10] matter whether he knew the name of the
[1:30:12] town or the cross
[1:30:15] streets it was just March Abraham yes
[1:30:19] amen where am I
[1:30:21] going you're going on a 2 5 year
[1:30:24] Journey if he would have told him that
[1:30:27] Abraham would have kept the calendar
[1:30:28] with
[1:30:30] him that's why no man knoweth the day or
[1:30:32] the hour the Gentiles don't have a
[1:30:35] calendar to go on it's when the last one
[1:30:38] of us right amen comes to full maturity
[1:30:41] in the body of Christ we're sealed
[1:30:43] believe that brother amen we're sealed
[1:30:45] amen amen you won't have a care or a
[1:30:49] worry cuz you'll know amen that you
[1:30:52] found Lord the Builder yes amen of the
[1:30:57] city yes that Abraham was looking for
[1:31:00] amen amen and that's really what matters
[1:31:03] brothers and sisters amen this life is a
[1:31:05] passing Shadow it's just a passing
[1:31:08] Shadow now Young Folks don't look at it
[1:31:10] that way because they and but Solomon
[1:31:12] cleared that up for
[1:31:15] us I was young
[1:31:18] once and I can look back at what Solomon
[1:31:20] said and I said now that man had wisdom
[1:31:22] he did yeah cuz youth is Vanity yeah you
[1:31:27] know youth doesn't
[1:31:30] know that there's an end no you're right
[1:31:35] they only know right I've just begun
[1:31:38] that's right
[1:31:40] right still with
[1:31:47] me Jude 5 and six kept not their first
[1:31:51] estate but left their own
[1:31:54] habitation he hath reserved an
[1:31:57] everlasting chains and I put in
[1:31:59] parenthesis for me bonds right amen
[1:32:03] bound okay under Darkness that'd be
[1:32:07] Joshua 9:13 I keep referring to Joshua
[1:32:10] for a reason because we're in a battle
[1:32:11] and he according to the prophet of God
[1:32:14] is The Greatest
[1:32:17] Warrior outside of Jesus Christ but
[1:32:21] remember Joshua bypasses the like you
[1:32:24] and me so he's in the same condition
[1:32:26] we're in Jesus knew where he came from
[1:32:29] he did he knew who he was and he knew
[1:32:33] where he was going you and
[1:32:35] I seem to be
[1:32:38] guessing it's not a guess right if
[1:32:41] you'll take God at his word am amen put
[1:32:44] all your confidence God's God's way of
[1:32:47] doing things is so
[1:32:50] incredibly different from what you and I
[1:32:53] think right you
[1:32:56] know in Joshua he was fighting a battle
[1:33:01] and the sun was going down and it was
[1:33:04] getting dark outside and he knew he
[1:33:08] needed more time yeah right man
[1:33:11] right now what Joshua did goes against
[1:33:15] all physics all science all
[1:33:20] astronomy everything right
[1:33:24] he said
[1:33:26] Son stand still
[1:33:29] immediately the scientific mind will go
[1:33:32] to no no it's already standing still and
[1:33:37] the and the and the and the Earth is
[1:33:39] rotating around it you know what I will
[1:33:41] not argue with
[1:33:45] you but catch this there came a
[1:33:49] time when Joshua
[1:33:51] said sonst
[1:33:55] and it's been standing still ever
[1:33:58] since believe that and I just love it
[1:34:01] when somebody from the scientific realm
[1:34:04] would say well 60 trillion years ago
[1:34:06] were you
[1:34:12] there yeah 15,000 were you there right
[1:34:17] they're they're trying to tell us there
[1:34:18] was no flood were you there amen they're
[1:34:20] trying to tell us there was no
[1:34:21] crucifixion were you there on
[1:34:25] I think there's a song about that is it
[1:34:26] were you there that's right were you
[1:34:29] there we were there yeah it's the only
[1:34:32] reason brothers and sisters you and I
[1:34:34] can sit in a building like this on a
[1:34:36] Sunday morning and tolerate nobody yeah
[1:34:39] right yeah we had to be there amen and
[1:34:43] there's a connection being made yeah
[1:34:45] come on but I don't see that
[1:34:49] connection amen thank you brother I love
[1:34:53] it when congregation preaches for it's
[1:34:56] an
[1:34:57] invisible
[1:34:59] Union so can I give you
[1:35:01] some
[1:35:04] advice stop looking for it amen right
[1:35:09] stop trying to explain
[1:35:13] it now when you're in a war when you're
[1:35:16] in a
[1:35:17] battle now
[1:35:20] remember that promise was made to Joshua
[1:35:25] as a physical tangible type yes Joshua
[1:35:30] keep my word and you won't lose a
[1:35:33] soldier a warrior there won't brother
[1:35:35] bam said it like this there won't be
[1:35:37] first aid there won't be Red Cross there
[1:35:41] won't be mash units there won't be there

[1:36:07] that's a Greek thing I learned that
[1:36:11] WD40 spray it on your joints and
[1:36:13] everything is good Windex Windex I'm
[1:36:21] sorry but think about it though come on
[1:36:24] now it doesn't really
[1:36:26] work however if your mind believes it
[1:36:30] works it's Faith the law of Faith
[1:36:32] operating in Windex
[1:36:34] works it ain't the Windex it's the
[1:36:41] faith in questions and answers in 64
[1:36:44] brother Bram had Howard caps get up and
[1:36:46] read a newspaper article about the
[1:36:49] Beatles on tap right amen
[1:36:56] wheelchairs crutches oh I'm getting to
[1:36:58] the infirmary part now by the
[1:37:01] wayall think about it I I'm a
[1:37:04] witness my mom was a singer and she
[1:37:07] followed music and they had the
[1:37:09] television on in my home when the
[1:37:11] Beatles came to Shay Stadium in New York
[1:37:15] City and there was crutches flying
[1:37:19] people getting up out of
[1:37:21] wheelchairs people undressing
[1:37:26] yeah and brother brandham says after
[1:37:28] brother caps reads the article he says
[1:37:30] you see brothers and sisters you can't
[1:37:32] rely on those
[1:37:35] things oh I caught that right away we
[1:37:39] believe in signs wonders and miracles
[1:37:40] but you can't rely on them I'll tell you
[1:37:43] why they follow right right right right
[1:37:46] they're back here we don't need to do
[1:37:48] like a can and reach back right they're
[1:37:52] automatic God need to look over his
[1:37:54] shoulder and say where's the sun I
[1:37:56] called for it two trillion years
[1:38:00] ago he said it and he went forward and
[1:38:04] whether the sun liked it or not it was
[1:38:06] developing in a world that was unseen
[1:38:09] right amen and eventually it was
[1:38:11] bringing light because that light was
[1:38:13] going to be necessary for the next stage
[1:38:16] of the journey which is that flying Ice
[1:38:19] Cube going through the air and whoop
[1:38:23] stopping right there Y A lot of people
[1:38:26] think that the Earth in The Big Bang
[1:38:28] Theory stopped right there brother way
[1:38:30] just exactly just exactly the right
[1:38:34] distance from the Sun to bring forth
[1:38:36] life I got news for you the sun said oh
[1:38:38] is Right Where I need
[1:38:40] it and then there was
[1:38:44] light amen see we're thinking in terms
[1:38:48] of education and Academia of reason of
[1:38:52] conscience of memory of affection
[1:38:55] brothers and sisters those are fine when
[1:38:56] they agree with the word of God but when
[1:38:58] they don't agree with the word you leave
[1:38:59] them in Jero
[1:39:02] amen leave them in Jericho cuz you'll
[1:39:05] never win the next battle
[1:39:08] no right brother people think artificial
[1:39:11] intelligence is something new it's not
[1:39:13] new it's a new term but it's not a new
[1:39:16] way of doing things that's true that's
[1:39:19] right come on we anybody that that knows
[1:39:22] about the history of the way things have
[1:39:24] worked up to this point knows they've
[1:39:25] been using algorithms for years how do
[1:39:29] you think they draw up commercials to
[1:39:31] get you to take a dirty plate with eggs
[1:39:33] on it and dip it in the sink with soap
[1:39:36] in there and pull it out it
[1:39:38] spotless brother bradam see when he saw
[1:39:41] that commercial he did on the sidewalk
[1:39:44] looking through a television you know
[1:39:46] they used to sell TVs right on the
[1:39:47] street he saw that he said
[1:39:50] ah I got it I'm going to go home right
[1:39:53] now and I'm going to show my wife how
[1:39:55] it's
[1:39:56] done didn't work out sis out honey let
[1:40:00] me show you puts a little apron on runs

[1:40:06] with the with the syrup and the eggs and
[1:40:08] the and the leftover hash browns and he
[1:40:10] dips it in there and he pulls out he
[1:40:12] said just as dirty as it
[1:40:18] was a form of artificial intelligence
[1:40:21] not that brother brandom had that but he
[1:40:22] was he was naive on that point he was he
[1:40:26] was still being formed he didn't know he
[1:40:28] learned why he this is what brother
[1:40:30] brandham learned from that would you
[1:40:31] learn the same thing that he learned
[1:40:34] this morning from artificial
[1:40:36] intelligence didn't work amen and he
[1:40:39] said I'll never trust Hallelujah another
[1:40:42] television commercial as long as I live
[1:40:46] you think you and I can get oh no look
[1:40:48] at they're having such a good time I me
[1:40:50] that's what their picture oh look at the
[1:40:52] the women look so good oh the men look
[1:40:55] so
[1:40:56] strong that's that's all it is bro right
[1:41:00] I mean come on I want everybody to
[1:41:02] understand I know you know this but it's
[1:41:04] truth and we're in a battle now I'm I'm
[1:41:06] explaining things that you understand so
[1:41:09] that we can bring in things that you

[1:42:15] interpretation to it and then when Billy
[1:42:17] Paul got 65 well what how old is an old
[1:42:19] man and he got 70 how old is an old man

[1:47:58] there there's a there's not one word
[1:48:02] seemingly in Psalms 27 about the Rapture
[1:48:05] but brother brandham used it when he
[1:48:07] preached the Rapture so what's in there
[1:48:10] right what's in there so I'm going to

[1:49:53] end of the
[1:49:56] war and when the battle's over amen we
[1:50:00] shall wear a crown after the battle
[1:50:03] Abraham met with
[1:50:06] MDC and think about Abraham's battle he
[1:50:09] just went down to rescue
[1:50:14] lot and I I've said this before but I I
[1:50:16] wanted to sink in you know that I
[1:50:18] personally would have never known nor
[1:50:21] could find a way to know
[1:50:23] that lot was saved outside of a prophet
[1:50:25] saying his righteous Soul was vexed
[1:50:28] because for me brother Wade I would have
[1:50:30] thrown the word righteous soul out and
[1:50:31] said he's vexed right amen I wouldn't
[1:50:35] have
[1:50:36] understood that his righteous Soul was
[1:50:39] his salvation right
[1:50:41] amen amen but don't you ever forget
[1:50:45] that's a type of the foolish virgin and
[1:50:47] I'm not settling for foolish virgin I'm
[1:50:50] I'm not settling for anything less than
[1:50:53] wise
[1:50:54] virgin cuz brother Bram in 144,000 and
[1:50:57] the 10 virgins tells us there's two
[1:50:59] classes in this saved
[1:51:01] group lot was saved the Sheep at the
[1:51:04] white Throne judgment are going to be
[1:51:05] saved but the bride is
[1:51:08] salvation don't we understand that it's
[1:51:11] time for us to go on
[1:51:14] Amen Hallelujah I make this statement
[1:51:17] brother Wade and there's a lot of people
[1:51:18] that don't like it but I believe it with
[1:51:20] all my heart salvation is the end result
[1:51:23] for the
[1:51:25] church but it's just the beginning for
[1:51:27] the
[1:51:29] bride they're both saved but the bride
[1:51:32] says something in her keeps driving her
[1:51:34] there's something more I'm not satisfied
[1:51:37] oh I'm saved but there's something more
[1:51:40] what is more than salvation lot was
[1:51:45] saved amen come on right brother I'll
[1:51:48] tell you what's more than salvation
[1:51:49] meeting with mzd

[1:55:32] I'm
[1:55:33] ready I'm ready to take the Chariot ride
[1:55:36] to the air but brothers and sisters I'm
[1:55:39] preaching to a group of people that are
[1:55:41] select that are elect that are special
[1:55:45] amen amen you've got to understand that
[1:55:48] you're
[1:55:49] special yes sir because people that have
[1:55:51] gone on before us they get to raise from
[1:55:54] the dead their body gets changed they go
[1:55:57] in the Rapture but you and I have the
[1:55:59] Rapture within us we got the Millennium
[1:56:02] in us we got the resurrection in
[1:56:05] us and it's going to stay right there
[1:56:07] until you and I ready
[1:56:09] amen so let's get ready
[1:56:13] amen so I'm going to talk to you about
[1:56:15] the tent Vision yes amen say man where
[1:56:18] did you get that
[1:56:20] from well I tell you what we could spend
[1:56:23] days breaking it
[1:56:25] down I I I my wife tells me and to her
[1:56:29] benefit I'm not real good with some
[1:56:31] words but you know people have been
[1:56:33] using this tent Vision that brother BR
[1:56:35] that's what we call it it's a succession
[1:56:36] of Visions it's the succession of
[1:56:38] brother Brandon being taken from one
[1:56:40] place to another from one place to
[1:56:41] another from one place to another now I
[1:56:43] believe brother Brandon was God's
[1:56:44] prophet and I believe that his Visions
[1:56:47] will come to pass the problem that we
[1:56:50] have is interpreting
[1:56:52] that's correct but there's one sure
[1:56:56] interpretation that cannot
[1:56:58] fail I know what you're going to tell me
[1:57:00] it's a prophet
[1:57:02] no the Bible says prophets can fail
[1:57:06] prophecy can fail this I don't believe
[1:57:08] blood Ram's word fails now it's God's
[1:57:09] word but let me tell you folks something
[1:57:11] we're at the time where like in the Book
[1:57:12] of Judges where's the prophet right oh
[1:57:16] it's the Holy Ghost brother BR told us
[1:57:18] the Holy Ghost is your Prophet today and
[1:57:20] if you got that Prophet living in of you
[1:57:22] guess what you're the benefactor from
[1:57:25] the prophecy coming to pass the
[1:57:28] interpretation of a prophecy is by
[1:57:30] bringing it to pass is that right once
[1:57:33] it's come to pass it's interpreted guess
[1:57:35] what God has ordained for you and I to
[1:57:39] become yes the coming to pass of the
[1:57:43] prophecy amen amen look it sure amen you
[1:57:48] say well well if if I die tomorrow you
[1:57:51] say well brother Chris has not left well
[1:57:54] I'm still with you yeah amen guess
[1:57:56] what's happening when you go to the
[1:57:57] other side they're pulling for you
[1:58:00] absolutely brother yes yeah talk about a
[1:58:02] third pull yeah amen pull for you yeah
[1:58:06] come on right come on Amen come on you
[1:58:08] can do it and and if you fall by the
[1:58:11] wayside come on come on come on you can
[1:58:15] do it but it's not you it's not the
[1:58:17] individual it's the mystical Body of
[1:58:19] Christ made up of many Members First
[1:58:21] Corinthians 12 tells us come on come on
[1:58:25] you can do it come on you can do it amen
[1:58:28] one falls to the right one Falls to left
[1:58:30] come on you can do it come on they're
[1:58:32] not stopping and when you fall to the
[1:58:34] right or the left and you go up beyond
[1:58:36] the curtain of time you're going to go
[1:58:38] come on you can do it come on you can do
[1:58:40] it they're pulling on
[1:58:44] us don't try to explain it that's the
[1:58:47] mistake the prophet made in the tent
[1:58:49] Vision that's right so I'm not going to
[1:58:52] try to explain it to you brother Lis but
[1:58:54] I'm going to give you what God has given
[1:58:57] me amen I'm going to get right down to
[1:59:01] where the Tent Service is going on big
[1:59:03] great grand now he called it other
[1:59:05] things than just a tent did he didn't
[1:59:08] only use the word tent but when you
[1:59:11] understand what a tent
[1:59:13] is a tent by definition is a stretched
[1:59:17] piece of
[1:59:20] skin that's where the word came from so
[1:59:23] I like to go back to the
[1:59:25] roots okay now Malachi says I'll leave
[1:59:28] neither root nor Branch oh we're going
[1:59:31] back even further than the Roots come on
[1:59:35] we're going back to the mind of God and
[1:59:39] God has set things up in such a way
[1:59:41] where there's a big meeting going on now
[1:59:43] I want you to notice something about
[1:59:44] this this okay brother Wade there's
[1:59:45] something about this meeting going on if
[1:59:47] you read about it and I'm going to quote
[1:59:49] to you or paraphrase out of what is a
[1:59:51] vision now brother brother brandom
[1:59:52] doesn't only talk about it in that
[1:59:54] message there's one before that that he
[1:59:56] gives a little bit and there's a couple
[1:59:57] after that that he talks about and then
[1:59:59] he talks about it in the seals he talks
[2:00:00] about it he goes into
[2:00:03] this God has set up an infirmary for you
[2:00:06] and me Amen brother yeah it's that
[2:00:09] little room there amen off to the
[2:00:12] side because a lot of people think
[2:00:14] that's the resurrection they got it all
[2:00:18] wrong you ain't going to raise missing a
[2:00:20] limb you ain't going to rais being
[2:00:23] paralyzed you ain't going to be raised
[2:00:25] walking on
[2:00:27] crutches that ain't in the
[2:00:30] Bible Abraham didn't stagger into
[2:00:32] Jerusalem that day on the day of the
[2:00:34] Resurrection say honey check it out no
[2:00:36] that's right brother come on amen that's
[2:00:39] right because he staggered not yeah
[2:00:43] amen but the prophet of God said he
[2:00:46] staggered all over the
[2:00:48] place one of the places he staggered is
[2:00:51] when he was confronted by the Pharaoh is
[2:00:53] that Pharaoh is that the president the
[2:00:57] ruler the
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:00] CEO confronted by the guy in charge and
[2:01:03] said your wife oh that's not my wife
[2:01:07] what did he do right there brother Wade
[2:01:08] he took his crutches
[2:01:11] out that's not my wife that's my sister
[2:01:15] come on he he got his crutes out he was
[2:01:18] afraid
[2:01:22] amen got out his crutches staggered all
[2:01:25] over the place no he did not you see the
[2:01:27] faith that he had in God staggered
[2:01:30] not but Abraham as a human
[2:01:35] being compromised but he would never
[2:01:38] compromise on God's word see that wasn't
[2:01:41] a test of whether he believed God or not
[2:01:45] it was a test of whether Abraham
[2:01:47] understood Abraham yes that's right amen
[2:01:52] was his half sister so he only told half
[2:01:56] the
[2:01:58] truth God his crutches
[2:02:00] out
[2:02:02] no
[2:02:04] staggered and guess what
[2:02:07] happened when when Sarah was taken from
[2:02:10] him brother he was
[2:02:14] paralyzed I don't mean
[2:02:16] physically he didn't know what to
[2:02:18] do got a paralysis patience in here see
[2:02:23] I'm not preaching on the physical
[2:02:26] now I believe in the physical
[2:02:29] amen but I want you to understand that
[2:02:31] all scripture and all prophecy is
[2:02:36] compound amen so here we come to the
[2:02:38] tent right brother brandom is not happy
[2:02:42] right he's up above the tent he is not
[2:02:44] on the platform right no he says
[2:02:47] seemingly
[2:02:50] like he had just got done preaching
[2:02:52] didn't he brother seemingly he
[2:02:55] says well put on a tape would you
[2:02:57] brother wait
[2:02:59] yeah
[2:03:03] yeah well I'm just I'm just I want you
[2:03:06] to see the whole picture I'm not I'm not
[2:03:08] battling anybody I want you to see the
[2:03:11] whole battle plan right amen that's all
[2:03:14] cuz the devil is here to deceive you and
[2:03:18] he will use any means that he can to get
[2:03:21] you from finding out who you really are
[2:03:24] cuz once you find out who you really are
[2:03:26] he's in deep trouble he's done lost the
[2:03:30] war we're in a battle but he doesn't
[2:03:33] want to lose the war he realizes in the
[2:03:35] in the battle you can lose a few
[2:03:38] constituents some church members can go
[2:03:40] by the wayside and he'll just build it
[2:03:42] up again yeah it's the war he's
[2:03:44] concerned with because the because when
[2:03:47] the war is over it's finished we all got
[2:03:50] to sit down and sign the treaties yeah
[2:03:53] right
[2:03:54] yeah and guess what happens to him nurg
[2:03:57] trials yes
[2:03:59] right he going to prison for a thousand
[2:04:03] years let's just put him in there and
[2:04:05] let him think about it h yeah that's
[2:04:06] right I mean think about he's going to

[2:06:47] stretched canvas he said between the
[2:06:49] tent meeting and the little room
[2:06:52] he wasn't happy about the meeting do you
[2:06:54] know why because after seemingly brother
[2:06:57] Brandon preached and they said he's not
[2:06:59] here right now he's resting they took up
[2:07:02] an offering and brother brandham was not
[2:07:03] pleased right
[2:07:09] right about the
[2:07:11] money there's a group of
[2:07:14] people off to the
[2:07:16] side and brother brandham said that
[2:07:18] cross and brandham Tabernacle was fitly
[2:07:20] placed
[2:07:22] on the right side the
[2:07:26] thief amen that asks for
[2:07:28] forgiveness amen it's all you got to do
[2:07:32] and I mean really genuinely I'm not I
[2:07:34] don't mean because you're
[2:07:35] afraid I don't mean because you don't
[2:07:37] want to suffer the I mean because
[2:07:39] something down on the inside said Lord
[2:07:41] I'm a sinner yes I'm genuinely hurting
[2:07:45] because I don't want to hurt you yeah
[2:07:47] right please forgive me Lord yeah amen
[2:07:50] please forgive me for being what I
[2:07:54] was and make me what I should
[2:07:57] be that's the desire of a real genuine
[2:08:01] Christian they're not trying to buy time
[2:08:04] they're trying to get rid of time
[2:08:06] amen that's right CU time shall be no
[2:08:08] more in Revelations
[2:08:10] 10 right so brother bam explains there a
[2:08:13] little room it's about 12 by 20 and this
[2:08:16] place and what is a vision there's a
[2:08:18] door on each side so see for years I
[2:08:20] used to try to think well maybe it's the
[2:08:22] Tabernacle in the wilderness and maybe
[2:08:24] it's the holy Place wrong size and
[2:08:26] there's not two
[2:08:28] doors but this has a door going in and a
[2:08:32] door going out
[2:08:35] amen and there's there's a woman there's
[2:08:37] a church remember don't ever forget
[2:08:39] about the B Bible says remember Lot's
[2:08:42] wife right

[2:08:47] church she w
[2:08:52] Battle of
[2:08:53] AI she just
[2:08:55] couldn't withstand the temptation to
[2:08:57] look
[2:08:58] back I don't want you to look back from
[2:09:02] this day forward stop looking
[2:09:06] back at the world at your life at what's
[2:09:10] gone on I don't it it could be
[2:09:14] terrible but you're not going to get
[2:09:16] anywhere by looking
[2:09:19] back always look forward like those four
[2:09:22] living creatures in Ezekiel 1 they
[2:09:25] didn't go backwards wherever they went
[2:09:28] they was going forward I don't care if
[2:09:29] they was going right left reverse or
[2:09:31] forward they was going
[2:09:33] forward according to the
[2:09:35] Bible so there's a a woman on one side
[2:09:38] of the door and she's got a what look

[2:16:24] last message that I'll ever preach and
[2:16:26] it's the last message you'll ever hear

[2:17:09] was paralyzed completely
[2:17:13] totally
[2:17:15] somehow she got into that little
[2:17:17] infirmary there
[2:17:21] door was closed on one
[2:17:23] side have no idea whether the door was
[2:17:25] open or closed on the other side alls I
[2:17:28] know is not hardly seemingly any time
[2:17:31] went by it was probably just the passing
[2:17:34] of the
[2:17:36] gurnie the passing of the stretcher get
[2:17:40] off that
[2:17:41] stretcher get out of that
[2:17:44] wheelchair I'm not talking physical now
[2:17:47] I believe in the physical of course
[2:17:49] manifestations but I want you to see men
[2:17:52] have been trying to make it either one
[2:17:54] or the other why can't it be
[2:17:57] both who said it can't be Prophet said
[2:18:02] compound and we've got a church right
[2:18:05] now brothers and sisters I'm being so so
[2:18:09] honest from the inside out to you how in
[2:18:11] the world could God's Prophet say I'm
[2:18:13] not doubting him I'm not even
[2:18:16] questioning him but if he was here and
[2:18:18] he said it to me I would ask him a
[2:18:19] question brother brand what did you mean
[2:18:22] when you said that the body of Christ is
[2:18:25] the sickest body you know see right it's
[2:18:28] you look at it you go wait a minute why
[2:18:29] would we want to go from one sick
[2:18:31] condition to another yeah right yeah why
[2:18:34] would we want to move from one dimension
[2:18:36] of sickness to another dimension of
[2:18:38] sickness it didn't make sense to me
[2:18:41] brother I begin to ponder to meditate
[2:18:45] I've been meditating for

[2:19:46] room yeah you understand
[2:19:51] a brother goes in there nexts with
[2:19:53] crutches the woman comes flying out
[2:19:55] pushing her stretcher down the street
[2:19:58] and then there's another church on the
[2:20:00] other side another woman on the other
[2:20:02] side of the door saying what happens she
[2:20:04] said I don't know yeah amen not a what
[2:20:07] do you mean you don't know third pull
[2:20:09] can't explain it not a public show

[2:20:18] right let just take all that in right
[2:20:22] and I'm closing yeah I know you said
[2:20:26] that please
[2:20:29] stand there's so much brothers and
[2:20:32] sisters you see we
[2:20:34] just if we would just break the bonds of
[2:20:39] being creatures of

[2:20:43] to sit in the church for six hours and
[2:20:44] hear spoken words The Original Seed you
[2:20:46] can hear that in 10-minute increments as
[2:20:48] a matter of fact I suggest five minute
[2:20:50] increments
[2:20:51] let it's so in take it in take it in you
[2:20:55] know don't eat it all at once you you
[2:20:57] know it'll be like Thanksgiving I can't

[2:21:05] turkey this is real
[2:21:10] amen and I'm getting everything I got
[2:21:13] out of this
[2:21:14] message now you may disagree with my
[2:21:16] interpret I'm not trying to interpret it
[2:21:18] to you I'm trying to introduce to you
[2:21:21] the idea that God is not a creature of
[2:21:23] time cuz the prophet of God said that in
[2:21:25] what message
[2:21:27] adoption you can be born in the family
[2:21:30] of God and still not be
[2:21:32] adopted right now there's controversy
[2:21:34] brother way you may know about it oh
[2:21:36] adoption is the Holy Ghost it is
[2:21:39] not you already got to have the Holy
[2:21:41] Ghost born in the family of God in order
[2:21:43] to be adopted because the Bible says in
[2:21:45] Luke that he was full of the Holy Ghost
[2:21:47] and then he went out into the Wilderness
[2:21:49] you think you in a battle Yeah right
[2:21:52] brother man amen what was the next thing
[2:21:54] after he was full of the Holy Ghost in
[2:21:56] the wilderness tempted by the devil
[2:22:00] we're talking about God manifest In the
[2:22:02] Flesh tempted by the devil adoption is
[2:22:05] Mount Transfiguration that's right and
[2:22:07] he already done had the Holy Ghost yes
[2:22:09] sir right that's where we're at amen
[2:22:13] right you see we're being transfigured
[2:22:15] we're being
[2:22:16] transformed believe that with all my
[2:22:18] heart brother brandham said Jesus was
[2:22:20] trans figured into his coming day yeah
[2:22:23] hallelujah amen and guess who that is
[2:22:26] yes the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[2:22:31] amen the bride amen yes
[2:22:35] amen you get the Holy Ghost
[2:22:38] now you get it in your soul yeah don't
[2:22:43] you wait in another minute you start
[2:22:46] working on yourself oh I didn't mean to
[2:22:48] throw yourself prostrate here on the on
[2:22:51] the pews I'm talking about you let the
[2:22:53] Inside Man work the outside man to where
[2:22:57] the outside man don't exist no more and
[2:23:01] don't worry what's going to happen to
[2:23:02] the Inside Man he's going to become a
[2:23:06] butterfly let's pray
[2:23:12] father let us not be paralyzed father
[2:23:15] either completely or or or partially
[2:23:17] Lord yes Lord it comes back father to
[2:23:20] the beginning of these Services 53 years
[2:23:24] father this post has been here
[2:23:31] yes the prophet of God told us that the
[2:23:33] devil would use the same tactics at the
[2:23:35] end that he used at the beginning on Eve
[2:23:39] he must have also employed it to those
[2:23:42] angels that fell there in Jude Lord
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:51] and that is
[2:23:54] father that he
[2:23:56] preached the
[2:23:58] gospel hath God not
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:04] said but he
[2:24:07] added and at the same time he added Lord
[2:24:10] he took
[2:24:11] away because of the word
[2:24:14] not it's a negative it takes away from
[2:24:18] but he added it in there Lord
[2:24:21] and he tripped
[2:24:24] up the first bride yes down here on the
[2:24:29] Earth but God you told us in your word
