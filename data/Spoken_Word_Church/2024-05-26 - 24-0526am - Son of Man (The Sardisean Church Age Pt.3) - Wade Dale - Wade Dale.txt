was people that was trying to do he and I bodily home at work and uh as long as he was there to take care of me they would not do anything but when I was left on my own they attacked and it it it brought back to my mind that you got to be able to stand on your own and not let me take care of you so and I've I've dreamed that dream not in exact terms but in the same way more than once amen so when we come to church every day we need need to seek all that we can get each time we're here because we are individuals and as Gentile God Saves us as such so just remember that we're going to read

Memorial Day is not for people that are still veterans that are still alive that's Veterans Day November 11th for our veteran brother Ela good to see you again God bless you good to have you with us and uh but Memorial Day is for ones that gave the ultimate sacrifice um Jesus gave the ultimate sacrifice for your soul but our soldiers gave the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom that we have and we appreciate that and I hope and pray that God gives them a special place somewhere because they gave their life so that we can sit right here today so that we can have a country ever how bad you want to think it is there still had to be Wars there's been Wars all the way back there's going to be Wars again and there's going to be wars fought for freedom and it's already been fought and we thank God that the war for our freedom is over with sir if you got Jesus Christ in your life today your the war of your Freedom's over with you might have a battle but the war is already W but we appreciate the ones that gave the sacrifice here on this Earth that shed their blood there's many a woman uh going to sit in her house today and not have a not have a husband because you passed way in war a child that can't be raised by a dad because he gave his life into the war and and the sisters too now that are fighting over there also we don't want to forget them either but there Memorial Day is is Veterans Day is for everybody to come together and you can see them but Memorial Day is for those that you can't see anymore it's just the memories as brother Louise said the memories is what's going to be the um that's what's going to come up first you're going to see the you going to the memories are going to be in your head so we sure do appreciate all the Armed Forces all the way around the world for that have fought for our freedom and we sure appreciate them and U and we pray that the U that the families will have uh they're still getting killed now I mean there's little Wars and all around all around the country and you got Israel and all that you know fighting so it's going to be a fight until we get out of here then there's going to be a real big fight but we ain't going to be part of it amen we've already won that Satan Was Defeated at Calvary so that battle's done we don't have to worry about it so let's stand to our feet I think that's about it if you have anything else to bring uh we can announce it this afternoon but I want to as we're standing there's two books I want to I want to you to U um to look at one is called God is real and it's written by Sister Regina Arline it's on Amazon all right and if you want to purchase it it's on Amazon and jun's read part of it I've read part of it and it's a it's true life short stories God is real so um that's one of our own and I hope you told all and I hope you told some of these people they're in it you name names you got to have copyright I think but anyway mine's not in it so I'm not worried about it maybe I was mentioned but it wasn't my name also another one and we've been talking about the n and Council dad had this in his library and it's written by a true Oneness uh he he's a a minister but he's he's Oneness he's he's not a trinitarian so he writes about n and the Nan Council it's like $7 on Amazon super neat read it tells you exactly how they formulated the Trinity how they come up with nas where they went to and it all comes all centers around the number three right but he keeps saying and refers to acts 238 and he even tells you when water baptism was changed uh from Jesus Christ to father son Holy Ghost all done in the Catholic church and this is a super book to read his name is uh Reverend Marvin Arnold and you get a screenshot you can see it or he is a he's written several books but this one right here we've been talking about Nan what happened at the Nan Council and he talks about Constantine and all the things he did it was really horrible the the the history books I know when we were growing up we we read about Constantine we read about the Crusades we that he was this good guy and he brought all that he was a devil the devil anointed that man to bring church and state together the church was about dead I'm not talking about the bride I'm not talking about the church age I'm talking about the church itself and what he done was he gave them political and spiritual power and give them all the places gave them all the money and said here let's build a kingdom and boy it's it really it opened my eyes and it's not very it's not very big they're thick so it's a good read so if you want to do that that's that's up to you Charles Spurgeon said have your heart right with Christ and he will visit you often so turn your weekends into Sundays turn your meals into sacraments turn your homes into temples and turn Earth into heaven Charles Spurgeon said that it's all in how you look at it so we're going to look into the word of God today and see what the Lord's got for us amen you love the Lord amen good to be in the house of the Lord so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you today for all the things that you give us for the purpose that we have here Lord as we were talking about the the motorcycle riders that they were doing they got up this morning they prepared they knew what they were going to do they are going to ride and and and Lord we as Christians we got up this morning we prepared for the day we put on our good clothes and we come to church Lord to hear from you father something worthwhile something that has an eternal status to it not something that's temporal father I pray that you'd anoint us for that job that we have today Lord be with the ones that are sick that are not here we have many many that are traveling Lord in different places Lord I pray that you'd bless them Father just forgive us of our sins in Jesus name amen remember brother he's in Marian South Carolina and I cannot remember that young brother's name he's preaching for but that's where brother Bob is at today so let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Revelations and let's continue our thought this is the sardian church age but I don't know if we're going to get to it all today or not cu the uh I was studying yesterday afternoon at Dad's and the Lord just brought something back to my memory that we had spoken years and years ago and we want to cover that again so let's read Revelations 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us WR in the book and send it where send it to seven churches not seven Church buildings seven churches all right which are in Asia Ephesus smura pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and leosa which we are now in that church age and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to PS with a golden girdle you may be seated the Lord has took he has took that and he has transferred every bit of that onto his bride all that all that he's going to do he's going to give it to the bride now I want you to look at something real quick I was thinking about this yesterday let's read Revelations now this is we've come into the sardian church age but we're going to back up for a minute into the tharan age just for a moment and the angel of the church in Sardis write these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars now what are those Seven Stars those are the Seven Stars are seven Messengers all right in the hands of God not in the hands of the devil not in the hands of man not in the hands of denomination in the hands of God now remember a star gives its own light right but it it supposedly and I say before as as brother dick talks about the Big Bang Theory he says well who flipped the switch okay all right so this thing banged off of this one and brother Brown said clinkers went out but they had their own light but it come from the original light which was the s o n not the Su n so these seven didn't have their own idea they didn't have their own agenda they were God's people that's who worked in the process that God wanted in that time those were those seven stars and we know there were seven men all right and for those people that don't believe brother Ryan was a seventh Church age messenger God's got to send us one I'm waiting on him if he's not here cuz he told me before the great and dead Dreadful day of the Lord he'd send me Elijah the prophet so God's got to send me a seventh Church age messenger so you can you can decide who you want him to be I know one thing's for sure William Mar bram's that amen amen and I rest my soul on that I'm not looking for some else why in The Heavenly days would you want to look for something else I mean come on I know that's right too sister Regina through all that tissue you blowing your nose I know that's right but those seven stars but listen what what I was looking at yesterday those Seven Stars they give off light right all right now and we enjoy them because we look up and we see them in the in the in the sky all right and they are they are there they're sure and just as those seven men are sure all of them all the way from Paul all the way to brother random that's shy all right they're in the hand of God there is no one else in the hand of God there now but now remember listen that seven those seven stars are representing multitudes of people in the church ages so we're not just holding Seven Stars up and see we we we do rever those seven men but that's not all there is that's righten they have a light that they Shine On somebody well now listen if you are the light yourself you're part of that star that's right listen there part this message is a part of my life yes amen it is it is life you're right brother it is life see it is life but where does it come from it comes from that seven there had to be a messenger that stood and not seven seven in one time one at a time and one died and the other one come up one died the other one come up one the other one come up and then we remember we'll look at it in a minute on the chart where it lapped over that's what I was thinking about I thought man we we do rever the stars and we know who these men are but they had a message and they were nothing without a people they were nothing without a people to listen to it and to adhere to it and to say as sister Hatty said that ain't nothing but the truth amen we're just like Mary that said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word send that seventh angel message I will if I'm bride I will attach myself to that praise the Lord eternity has got to connect with eternity praise the Lord but those Seven Stars we know who they are join to the angel of Sardis of the church which we know who that was that was Martin Luther I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and our dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that they are ready to die that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God in other words there the the th tyan Church age we're going to talk about in just a second back up again is that they had works all right they had works and then God said do my works now this church age coming out of the tharan church age you got a group of people that has works but they're not perfect all right they've got works they got good works in there but they're not perfect why they took on a father son Holy Ghost baptism during this time they took on a trinitarian Doctrine during that time and they've made it Doctrine that's why you have to have a messenger that's why our messenger had to be a prophet cuz remember he got an alpha bride that was the alpha bride a prophet Paul was on the scene you got to have an Omega bride according to the Bible does everybody believe the Bible do you believe God changes his mind no he does not there's a alpha bride and the Omega Bride on this side and there got to be bookends so if God sent a prophet in the first church age he got to send a prophet because remember Luther and Wesley were not prophets they were reformers right amen they reformed the people they didn't return them back Malachi 4 restores back to the faith of this man right here Apostle Paul right and tell me where William Brandon missed it at no way amen I really don't care that they can't find he had there's 12 people fell off a bridge I don't care I don't care he brought God to me he brought this word to me he brought life to me yes sir his voice is a voice of God for this age my word people had fallacies we're going to read about Martin Luther Martin Luther started an Insurrection and had a bunch of people killed right Martin Luther they all had their fallacies they all had their well they were human that's right Paul killed Christians what do they say about him oh well he ain't no Prophet cuz he he don't act like one well you think he didn't because when he he put those people to death before he became a a born again believer but God used that person yes sir for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold hold fast and repent God gives time every Church age he rebukes him and he says I'm going to give you time to repent yes all right today God said I'm going to give you a time to repent right and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come to thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in starst which have not defiled their garments all right there's a few people that are there and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed and white rment coming out of that dirty Church age there's somebody that's going to be white yes right and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father as brother Luis was talking about the memorial we want God to say come on in my good and faithful servant I'm not going to remember those times that you lied I'm not going to remember hello somebody I'm not going to remember those times that you did this and that and the other I forgave you you asked for forgiveness I give it I told you to repent and you did but there's another group he's going to come up and they're going to say that and he's going to say you didn't repent I gave you time to repent and you didn't but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels He that I ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches all right get rid of that Josh I don't know what that's all about anyway he that have to near let him hear what the spirit says to the churches I can't get this thing it's locked can't get it to move Luis did you should watch Luis he's like I run I do this computer thing and he's over I watch him he's just doing that me I touch it one time and it locks he got that little doohickey thing right there see that so I got a preach that all over again yeah oh okay brother Daniel I'm sure you're not going to have a problem with any of this you're not going to use this at all I'm sure right I didn't think so okay listen this never runs out of batteries it just stays hooked up all the time all right so we're good with that okay but we are for you to be able to see what we're talking about so there's the seven Church ages is everybody with me Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and then the Elijah coming in the end time which was William brandham all right we see all the church ages there was a lap over we preach about the porter every Church age look those Church ages lap over and as we were as uh I was watching brother Tim pro it this morning he he brought out the same thing he said look whatever they get we get whatever bad they get that Devil's still here whatever good they got is here with us all right cuz those Church ages are lapped over they're not separated there was no separating time when it wasn't a on the earth there wasn't a separating time when there wasn't a messenger on the earth or people that carried that message cuz remember Columba died before 606 when his church age began so it had to be a group of people somebody had to get the Revelation and carry it for 900 years and the messenger was already off the scene we've had one off the scene 60 years can't we carry the message that he preach and we got it Book and Tape for him Columba they just had to remember what he said praise the Lord for technology I mean really well sometimes but we know that that the anointings were the lion ox man and Eagle we're going to get into that in just a little bit there's something I want to talk to you about on that so now let's just review just for for the ones that were not here let's go to tharan church AIDS now this is where God said I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works it keeps going thy Works thy works and the last be more than the first now watch what happened the last be more than the first in other words brother Daniel God said I'm going to have my people are going to be in the worst age but they're going to be better at the end than they were at the beginning now to me and you that's not that's not I mean we start with one toach and now we want three toach no we don't want that but you start with God and then you want more of God even though even though it looks like that that the ranks are thinning out and all this garbage is going on across the message the true bride will hold true every single time you've heard brother Dell say many times people say oh the bride looks bad the bride has never looked bad that's right you're looking at all that other garbage out there the other the other uh mixed multitude that ain't got the Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost you'll come to the word every time cuz the Holy Ghost can't find the Holy Ghost that's right they got to flow together all right and I will kill her children with death now we covered that I will kill her children with death you'd think you would say I will kill my children with a sword or I'll kill my children with this he said I'll kill her with death death is going to kill death he's given them a word that they could live by but they died by it right and all the churches shall know that I am he that searches the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works on and he that overcometh and keepeth my works ah unto the end to him will I get power over the Nations now remember this is the ox age we had a lion first three ages the ox age was the middle age we've coming up to the man age which is going to be intelligence all right we'll talk about that later on not today but this Ox age is an age of Works what does an ox do an ox works all right a man he'll get he'll take his intelligence and he'll figure out a way to let somebody else do it or let a piece of Machinery do it but the ox just know know I got a plow so put the thing on me and I'm going to plow well that's what they did in that fourth Church age they plowed through that church age but it was God in those people James 2 ver1 17 says if so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone you got to put the two together yes sir all right yeah a man may say thou H has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works amen for as the body with the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also in other words faith is in motion faith is something that we do if we have faith in something we're going to do it if you don't have faith in something you're going to not do it until you learn how to do it and then you'll do it I do not have faith that I can take that panel off of that Electrical uh door over there and just start moving stuff around I have no faith in that whatsoever amen but a master electrician some of you too brother Aaron different ones you can go over there and say oh that goes here this goes here this goes here and you're totally safe with it why you have faith in come on somebody you have faith in what you learned you have faith in what you were taught right if I had been taught to be a master electrician that wouldn't be a problem to me if you've been taught right in the word of God these Revelations that's coming you're not going to have a problem with and these falsities that's coming you not not have a problem with them either all right and brother Brown says look now the two men that were talking on faith Paul Justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham but James Justified Abraham by what man saw in Abraham see now James says he's justified by his Works Paul said he's justified by faith but see Abraham believed God and it was what God saw in him God saw the the heart of Abram to begin with and then he developed into Abraham right he believed it yes but then when he went to acting as though it was already done that's what man saw in him he kept saying I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby 25 years I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby guess what one day his faith produced what he believed amen you just hang on what you got now you got to have faith in it though you got to have faith in it when you have faith in it just hang on hang on for your children wife husband mother who no no no no but remember here's our problem we try to save our kids we try to figure out a way to manipulate them in the church my Mama Tried it for 20 years and didn't work oh it's Easter Mr Debbie it's Easter C they always remind you hey Tim it's Easter M it's Mother's Day you you don't have to do that anymore because now I believe that every day is an Easter every day is a memorial day every day is a Victory Day every day that we live as Spurgeon said we ought to make every day a Sunday Abraham believed God that's what God saw in him he believed it but then when he went to acting as though it was already done so Abraham comes to a time when Abram could produce what he said he got with Hagar got with the wrong person it's kind of our problem sometime we get with the wrong person and we produce a wild child all right but when Abraham got 99 he was dead and you know what he done one day I believe he said God I'm dead I tried to figure this thing out for 25 years you you I thought we did it with Hagar I thought we did it here I thought I I thought you were here with me and I met you when I in in the uh when we went to the slaughter of the Kings I met you you gave me communion I'm done I can't do it no more and God said that's exactly where I want you to be right there cuz I'm going to come in the plains of mammory I'm going to come and I'm going to bring a message to you and say look your name's not going to be Abram anymore your name's not going to be lost anymore your name's going to be Christian and you're going to be changed this message is not just oh God never mind it makes a change it changes your thought process that's why some people can't handle it amen it's not from this world this is eternal we're trying to do it with a finite mind that's why Paul said get the mind of Christ then you'll understand what he's talking about cuz Paul said look I didn't have the mind of Christ I had the mind of a denomination I had the mind of the Old Testament sure it was good for that time but God moved through those Commandments and he came and died at Calvary Paul didn't see that right Saul was blinded to that but when Saul turned into Paul and he got the mind of Christ he said oh my what a Wretched Man that I am oh this body is just it's it's horrible but I thank God through Jesus Christ who has given me the victory oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your Victory the Apostle Paul told us that that's the same it is to us because our works watch our works Express what faith we have like I said before you're not going to see me go over there and open that panel up and try to fix that electrical panel but a master electrician will show you his faith in what he's doing by going over there and working on it right but if we're afraid to act on what we believe there's the whole thing if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it pretty simple pretty simple you just don't believe it and listen this message and this listen this is the message don't talk about 1100 books this right here is for believers people that believe that God's going to do what he said that's what was down to the church ages they believed they didn't have they didn't have they Harley didn't have books come on they had to depend on on somebody to preach the gospel to them and they said that ain't nothing but the truth cuz the Holy Ghost was inside of them right and in in in Martin Luther's day it was the just shall live by faith I don't have to do penants anymore I don't have to pay I was reading a book yesterday there was a man he wrote a book called the 50 years in the Roman Catholic Church he became a priest but before he became a priest he was a child and he was part of the Catholic system well his daddy died and the and the wife was left with him and that was it him and her him and her and I think it was maybe a sister so the priest comes and instead of giving them hope and instead of giving them something to sustain him with he says oh you need to pay for this Penance you need to pay Penance because your your husband is in purgatory burning and she's like I don't have a dime my husband was a so bread winner the only thing I have is a cow that gives us milk and butter to sustain our life the priest took it the priest took it this is true the priest took it cuz that's what the woman said all I got is this cow he said okay I'll take it and they he said he watched him he laid it right onto his house that's the kind of religion the Catholic church is you don't have to pay penants to get out of hell yeah but remember if you believe something you got to believe it what's your faith in today my Faith's in the word of God I know th works in the last to be more than the first this is Brother R I'm speaking this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor rooll of the martyrs grew lengthier by the day they by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased we get a problem we scatter like chickens I don't know what to do go to church read your Bible pray I don't know about ain't that what we do though as as when we when we're we're teetering and wavering a little bit we get first little problem we we don't go to church and we like I said before check all your boxes right all right because it ain't the preacher's problem it starts with you and mind starts with me but they served all the more and their faith increased let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service Satan doesn't know how to handle that that's one thing Satan don't know how to handle cuz when he does to somebody out there they fall apart as I said before what I got written in my Bible tragedy defines a Christian it does not destroy them it defined who job was tragedy none of you have lived through that tragedy not one of you left left every lost every child all your belongings your cattle your horses your cars he lost everything all he had was a wife and a pile of Ashes right right though God slay me yet I'll trust him his faith was stronger and Satan said Satan said now I I'm going to make him curse you he never did so Satan was the one walking away doing this scratching his head I think he might have moved on to somebody else cuz he was done with that one he couldn't do anything to that one ain't that what brother R said you s we want to be at a place where Satan doesn't know what to do with us cuz we're so totally contrary to the world we're we should be contrary to the thinking of the world separated from the world think different act different dress different and we do it from the heart not from the letter let the enemy attempt to th our service to the Lord our reprise in increase service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory th IR in church age I want to give you a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity that's somebody tell me the other day said I know it says I need to go to church okay and you don't show up that's iniquity cuz you're confessing you know and that's iniquity that's why abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold and the lay out of sin or last age selflove selfie sticks they didn't have them except for this age hello somebody in the L toy in the last days self- Lov and the love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in those last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives fill our lives with his love or we will F the cold ESS of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us that's right now remember as we started just a background for some of the the brother Daniel and them that weren't here every Church age that began in Ephesus there was a worship of a woman all right so then you got her name was Diana then you had tharan age we read the other Sunday day where there was a propheus that sat on a three-leg stool hello somebody on a three-legged stool and prophesied she didn't have nothing to do with the with the the going of the th tyan AE no it was it was what devil worship all right then in our age we see Satan is so slick and if you'll read this book he's so subtle he just slips little things in little sayings and slips this in and slips this in cuz that that brother C covers that he says as for brother Dale brother Brandon and all of them quote that they took down Zeus and put up Paul they took down this one and put up Peter they just transferred all that paganism right into Christianity right but it all come from the woman worship Diana the first one in the first church age tharra there was a propheus we're going to see that this next age coming up is going to be sael which is a woman and then you're going to find out that had transferred from from that woman had a son and the son was supposed to be the one the chosen one and then they done away with him and now they have mother worship that's exactly what it is so our age culminates in what it brings it into Christianity the great and her daughters all right so everybody with me and I will kill her children with death God said this God said I'll kill him cuz I'm going to give him a chance to repent he's G us a chance to repent you better turn around and go somewhere different cuz I'm going to kill you with spiritual death first and then when you die spiritually there's a second death you got to worry with amen right the Bible says blessed is he that doesn't have to come to that second death we'll read it in just a second and I will kill the children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works 1 Timothy 5:6 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth those people that formulated that Nan counsil formulated the Pope the the mother worship and all those they call it mariology now Mary has been exalted above Jesus and you just pray to her you don't have to worry about him this is so slick in that book and I'll get the name of the of the author but he was a he was a Catholic priest right for 25 years and then he come out and for 25 years he's been Christian now this has been in the late 1800s but he said they would set them down as kids and this is how they formulated the worship of Mary they say son who beats you at home and he would say my father well who intercedes for you if your father gets too rough oh Mom does well who comforts you when you're sick uh father no no no mother you see how they formulate in that child's mind that the mother is the one you got to go to who do you go to with your problems do you go to your dad no I don't go to my dad I go to my mom you see how slick that is they inserted that mother worship right in there forget about the son worship the mama cuz she's so good thire and church age I will cast her into bed it will be a bed of tribulation of the Great Tribulation that's what will come upon the Harlot and her daughters secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death or by death wow let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging execution or some other way but say let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death spiritual death came in the minute the First Church of Rome organized it died the minute that the Luther organized death came in they died the Pentecostals came along last they organized the spirit left there's a lot of Pentecostals sitting there I'm sure they were mad at him the spirit left though they don't believe it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of the one of the godhead came they organized and they died too then after the fire of God fell on Ohio River 1933 now he's bringing his message a healing Revival swept the world but it never came through any organization God went outside the Pentecostal group outside of organization and what he's going to do in the future is going to be outside organization anybody with me God can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of Babylon so you see death organization came and the church died or to make it pler death became a resident now when you have somebody come and visit you they're visitors right but when you have someone residing in your house they live there everybody with me all right we call them residents at the post office because that's where they live it's a residency or to make it plain or death became a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as the original eeve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corruptors nicolinis and bism and he covers that here in this book didn't call it that but you can read it propagated by what a woman or a dominating female now the word death means what that separation natural or violent of the soul in the body by which the life on Earth is ended now that's death as we know it as we're going to have a funeral next Thursday but the Bible says you're dead while you're living if you take on that organizational thought or idea outside the word of God you're sitting here alive as brother R said about that woman that that was half naked crawling down the um the uh where was she she was in a Howard Johnson or something and she was having a party buddy this is life she said brother R said he didn't she didn't know that she was dead amen so now let's cover this real quick this is where I wanted to back up to cuz we're going to look at the opening of the seals later on but God through a prophet told us that that God was going to open the seals up to us in this age right uh Paul never preached on them irenius all the different ones even John the Revelator he wrote about them but he didn't preach about them Paul was already dead when the seals came to be written down so they had to be shut up as in Daniel says to the time of the end so that people can understand them all right so to understand them we brother brandom simply broke it down to the first seal second seal third seal fourth seal and then the Rapture of the church all right I'm going to slow down just a second right the Rapture of the church happens on the fourth seal because what the combat Beast the four line ox man and Eagle which is the Holy Ghost in you today the believer is gone right fifth seal doesn't say come and see so therefore the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal so now you can't take though the church ages and put them all together with the seals you got to look and see that the first three Ages was the lion brother I'm going explain it all right the ox age is right here one age the big long one man is Luther Wesley and then Elijah is the eagle anointing all right is everybody with me all right so now listen so we're going to see the first seal the second seal third and fourth cuz we because we're raptured after that there's no more the fifth sixth and seventh seal we'll talk about it later it laps back into the seals right everybody with me spiritually spiritually brother R said spiritually they were they were preached in the Feast of the trumpet spiritually you got to think spiritual so now let's look at this real quick let's go to Revelation 6 verse one and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals now here's the opening of the seals the seals fixing to open and brother BR said they opened in the church ages and we believe that cuz I see them open all right and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts which was what the lion saying come and see right and I saw Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow remember brother Brandon was confused on this boy people don't amen that much but he said he was okay I'll read it to you in J J's book I mean in the seal book he said he was confused on that cuz he thought that was the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost or the mighty conqueror but the book hadn't been open all the way so the book now is open hello somebody the mighty Angel come down with a book in his hand he didn't give it to brother brandham he gave it to John brother brandham was a mouthpiece that Christ used to get this to us and you and I are the beneficiaries of it if you'll accept it if you don't then it's not for you anyway I saw him behold now watch this is John sees a sea Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow oh boy looks good looking good but don't say anything about Arrow who go hunting how'd you like to go grizzly bear hunting with I got my bow dude you go over y under I'll probably have to bury you somewhere but you're going over that way I'm going over here with my with my uh bow and arrow and a crown was given now look a crown was given he didn't come with one he was given one and he went forth conquering and to conquer now look in those first three ages watch what Satan did he bluffed his way into the true white righteous Church there was a true church the first three ages they had the power of the lion anointing they were bold they had Jesus had just come off went off the scene and come back onto day Pentecost and a group of Believers that had no denomination they weren't worried about an Nia Council they were getting people to Christ but remember when God rides out Satan rides right with him Satan rides right with him and looks just like him he bluffed them into believing that was the white righteous Church of the first three Church agents when it was not it was Satan he was a bluff he was sitting on a horse with a bow no arrows nothing to shoot you with and a crown was given to him what by the people right everybody with me and he went forth conquering into conquer in other words he started out even the great Paul irenius and Martin they they went to all these different places and established churches so did the devil and some people's like this is it and it wasn't Satan bluffed them into believing they were alive when they were dead all right but there is a boldness of the lion l o n the lion the first three ages that first seal we see that was a white righteous Church there was a there was a church AG or there was three Church ages that had power they had bow and Aras and they conquered the world for Christ during that time but Satan was riding the same time with them on a white righteous Church horse and he bluffed his way into those first three ages cuz what happened at the end of that third age NAA comes in everybody with me this is the culmination of what Satan's going to do right here now what's he going to do the first the first church or the first three Ages was white okay now remember Satan's going to get off his white horse and he's going to get on a red horse for the middle Church age which is the fourth Church age all right now watch Revelation 6:3 and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast the O say come and see all right everybody with me here all right and they went out another horse now what is a horse a horse is a power and Satan just jumped up on that horse hello somebody and power was given him permitted power was given him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should what kill one another remember died to death death by death and there was given unto him a great sword now look and the first time over here here you're going to see he had a bow with no arrows he couldn't do anything he's a bluff but now God allows him to pick up a sword listen you live by the sword you die by the sword didn't he tell Peter that pretty much put sword up Peter this is not this not your battle all right but he was given a great sword or a great word that came out of a council hello we we're heading out of the Third Church age into the fourth Church age everybody with me fourth Church age is thyra and they went out a horse that was red now what happened during the tharan church age 68 million Christians were killed talk about blood talk about [Applause] red let's read what the prophet said about that then we're going to get to the third seal later on when we go to the man age which would be the Lutheran Wesley are the third seal which is the black horse amen you said well I think it should be God didn't ask you your opinion the red horse is over here the killing the listen the Blackness of that third of that fourth and or the fifth and sixth age was that man took over denominations came in there was all kind of ideas happened that was black now let's go to the second seal when the slain risen L risen lamb opened it and the second calf Beast said come see what the seal mystery is now we get it the lamb you remember has to open every seal now remember the Lamb's a guy that stands there with the Seven Stars in his hand so he's got control about all this all right thank God not not we don't he does now we get it the lamb you remember has to open every seal and the second beast second beast ox if you notice in the routine of what we just went through with the church ages the same thing he he reverts you right back to the church ages so I don't understand why people won't read a church age book they're denying a lot of the message people deny a lot of the message anyway so look now the first was a lion right he backs up a little bit the first was a lion next was a was a calf or ox or something you see and this Beast said come see now when the lamb opened the seal and then when went to see and when he walked in what happened let's see what we found come see there's a mystery sealed up here that's been here now for 2,000 years about let's see what it is now we find here that he saw what a red horse go forward everybody with me on that now brother B said look notice that sure show they they should kill one another they should kill each other his bow had no arrows at first so the first three ages there wasn't any killing that was just bluffing the people into believing that they the the devil was right everybody with me white righteous Church White Power all right now we getting into a red horse his bow had no Arrow at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from White Horse to a red horse the same exact Devil with his sword what did Jesus say Jesus said they that take the sword will perish by it don't fight back see Jesus that night when he told Peter took the sword said just just do like he did just go ahead now remember he's got a sword he's going forth with a sword in his hand riding a red horse waiting through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him right now do you understand it how many understands what that seal is now what it was the middle Church age the the th tyan Church age now what did Jesus say that take up the sword we'll perish By The Sword is that right all right this writer and all his kingdom subjects that are slain down through the age that's draw all this Blood of the martyrs remember he's referring to Revelation where it talks about the cup the great whoree the cup she's standing there with a cup that's full of blood that's running over because they killed so many people because they didn't believe in the Catholic Church 68 million Josh what was that Josh looked up the other day 68 8 million people is California and Texas if you take those two states there's 68 million people in those two states Catholic Church wiped them all out it's like you took everybody out of Texas and killed them and everybody out of California and killed them that's 68 million people and they got it written down it ain't here say it's written down in their mology dra all this Blood of the martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes they that take the sword will slain be slain By The Sword they took the sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshipers all down Through the Ages by the millions and when Christ comes with the sword for it is his word that proceeds out of his mouth I am telling you that's in this age right he's got his sword in his hand in this age for it is his word that proceedes out of his mouth he will slay every enemy there is before him you believe it kill the enemy brother Ernie says hack them whack them whatever else he said now watch what did Jesus say he that takes the sword all right red horse here's what she's coming now watch you might have killed 68 million of them down Through the Ages since then maybe more but Jesus said he that takes the sword will perish by it watch as the Impostors against the word of God and because they didn't agree in these things Satan placed United the political power which he held and the spiritual power which he held together and made a church now he tells you about this right exactly where they married it's in this book it's really good book and he put Millions times Millions not just a few hundred millions after he jumped look after he jumped from his White Horse onto his red horse and he took his sword and went forth but God said the same thing that he perverted tried to the false teaching that same word were in power today coming forth from the lips of Jesus Christ and it shall slay him and everything before him amen there's the second seal do you love him oh my that's thus sayith the Lord praise be to God now on the third seal he reverts back now watch this is this is neat then we'll then we'll stop now what was he given then first he had a bow but he didn't have any arrows but now he's got a mighty sword in his hand he can do something now then he jumps off his White Horse the white horse rides on out now he straddles what a red horse blood blood blood red horse he really rides that one oh sure now he's given great power and great sword to kill then he rides his blood white blood red horse we see from the second seal that was broke last night he taken peace from the earth and killed one another and his own mology of the Roman Catholic Church shows that they put 68 million Protestants not just vagrants not just professed Christians true Christians were put to death because they wouldn't do penants they wouldn't do the that's what so mirac the reason I'm reading this really is so miraculous that Martin Luther was in that system hello Martin Luther was a Die Hard Catholic and God got a hold of him and pulled him out that's why brother Bram said he one of the greatest Church age Messengers one of the most re renowned because he started the Reformation he he started to re the Protestant to protest the Catholic Church everybody else during that 900 years they were doing this yes papa Pope yeah they put 68 million Protestants to death from a time of St hippo Augustine of Hippo after St Augustine of Hippo until 1580 68 million Smuckers great reform if you want read it glorious reform it was now 68 million recorded on mology when one of their so-called Saints got the Revelation that anybody that disagreed with the Roman Church should die the heretic they just sent them around them boy he went to spill in the blood he jumped on his White Horse and on his red horse and he went riding oh now his great power comes he was made a viker of heaven and worshiped his God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him a ruler on Earth give him a crown over that he could prey the souls out of Pur Purgatory if you paid him enough he could also enter in other words intercede he was just like God on Earth instead of God together he had great power to kill whomever did not agree with his command who's going to say anything to him now listen that same spirit is right here today I hope not in this building but today that same Spirit brother Brown says you kill a man's influence you've killed the man so we got people going around killing the influence of of us Believers that's where that Spirit come from who's going to say anything to him the church can't say nothing he's head of IT State can't say nothing he's head of it so they died by the millions all them little churches brother was busted up and killed and murdered and fed the Lions and everything else see the dragon Rome gave him his seat and Authority the Bible said so so he rode his typed red horse through human blood till it became a red horse and here's what happened in that age Matthew 6: 211 let's stand our feet come on musicians we'll get to we'll get to the sard Ean Church age one of these days for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye now listen we have two eyes right but we see single everybody with me we have two eyes but we see single if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee if if you if you carry inside of you something contrary to the word of God and I'm going to say in the message of the hour that light in you is darkness and God said what how great is that Darkness why because you're fooled as all those were fooled down Through the Ages listen Satan's a fooler fools people all the time he he can't be I mean he's a uh he's a master manipulator that's why brother R said we're no match for the devil but the Bible says resist the devil and they'll flee from you how powerful is that let's sing a song God bless you but think about these Church ages and about the seals now that's open showing what happened understand why I am so happy and [Music] free I crossed over Jordan to can fair and this is like heaven to me sing it to him

make them real hungry that's how that's how cruel those Romans were but they were sitting in that dungeon with nothing left nothing left they had nothing maybe their kids were there with them and they didn't have to be drug out they walked out showed so much boldness of Faith until it's recorded that the Roman soldiers would throw their now listen they had a right to stay alive they were Roman
