called This is yeah yeah I'm called well then you gotta you'll be ready I said okay I'll be ready so be praying for me I'm I'm a little rusty but uh let's just pray that it's not me at all it's the Lord Jesus that wants to speak to us all something amen let's go before the Lord in prayer before we get into his word amen our dear and precious Lord and heavenly father I come before you Lord God of course Lord Jesus first of all Lord God I want to be grateful Lord God that you've forgiven my sins Lord God and you've you've gone to Calvary that it's a finished work Lord God you've provided for us

you promised us in your word that you would abide wherever two or three are gathered in Your Name Lord Jesus and of course we are gathered in Your Name Lord so we pray you bless us each and every one in Jesus Christ's holy name amen hallelujah and when you can be seated uh I'll ask you to stand in just a little bit I was just wanting to you know just say that uh we have never experienced the kind of cold that came this time here in Georgia I mean New Mexico gets cold yeah it's cold over there but uh not not like this this is Wet This is a wet cold it just goes right through your clothes never seen it like that I've heard of it but never seen it uh and uh it was painful I mean I've never seen it where you walk out in the in the in the weather like that and your face just feels like it stings but uh we got through Christmas it was great uh all the grandkids Josiah Olivia yeah uh uh Jonas Sophia it's great to see them again I enjoyed their having them and and being around them and uh playing with them somewhat Mordecai and Isaiah they're they're great little kids and I have a good time with them and of course my my own children too they're they're not put aside but we had a great Christmas uh Joseph asked me to uh to do a little Christmas sermon uh because Sunday came around and it was Christmas day so uh I I did start off trying to preach there uh wasn't I don't know if it was successful or not you'd have to ask them but uh but I talked a little bit about uh about John the Baptist and I want to talk a little bit about the ministry this I want to I want to talk a little bit about the ministry and uh and so let's uh let's stand up and go before the Lord and as we read his word amen I want to turn to Isaiah the 40th verse 40 and 3. and bear with me because I use markers to get to where I need to be Isaiah 40. the third verse it says the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God amen you can be seated I got a lot of scripture so I'll be going through a few scriptures but this scripture here is Isaiah hundreds of years before John the Baptist was even born and the scripture says that John the Baptist even received the Holy Ghost while he was yet in his mother's womb not too many of us get that opportunity but uh he actually received the Holy Ghost while healing his mother's womb you can read that in Acts uh I think it's acts 1 and an interesting thing I was reading uh I was reading about John the Baptist in a way where John the Baptist was was told his whole Ministry was described by an Angel of the Lord to Zechariah and uh as he just as he was described to uh Elizabeth I mean to Zechariah the angel explained some details about his ministry and I'd like to talk a little bit about some of the things that were said so let's go over to uh Saint Luke 1 verse 11. and uh let's go over there real quick this one I don't seem to have marked so bear with me say Luke 1 verse 11. Saint Luke 1 verse 11 and this is the Angel the angel speaking to Zechariah um okay and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense um you know I was uh the Christians or should I say in the Old Testament they used to burn incense and incense stood for what you know the prayers of the people it represented the prayers of the people so zechariah's turn came about and he was going to offer incense and okay uh let me go on reading angels are standing at the right hand side of the altar of incense and when Zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear Came Upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayers have been heard and the and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear a son in his and he shall he shall be called and and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither strong wine nor strong drink where does this come up we understand that the angel Lords also spoke to to brother Brown and said you're not don't drink a strong drink okay uh and and when and and he's he he's he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turned to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit in power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just notice he didn't say turn the hearts of the fathers to the children now if we go back to Malachi 4 we find out that the scripture of the coming of Elijah in Malachi forces he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children at the end of the verse but it doesn't say but here the Angels saying he's going to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children okay but it doesn't say the children back to the fathers the children back to the fathers was a reference given in Malachi 4 that brother Branham explained and we understand through the message that it's the message of this hour that brings us to that brings us to that so it's it's almost a a division of a whole uh Ministry the ministry of John the Baptist is different from the ministry of William Branham or should I say the prophet of this hour so let's take a look so we see he stopped there now we go over to uh uh Jesus when he was uh saying the spirit of the Lord is upon me and I uh he was he was quoting reading out of the book of Isaiah Isaiah 60 and 1. and let's go over there Isaiah 60 and 1. this is uh of course the scripture we're referring to as Saint Luke 4 18. Jesus is reading let's go to there first saint Luke 4 18. Hallelujah Saint Luke 4 18. be praying for me I'm a little rusty don't wonder if I'm going to get this point across 4 18. okay well let's just go 4 17. and uh 417 and there was and there was delivered unto him they're giving him the book The Book of the Prophet is Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written and Jesus speaking here it's in red the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach the delivery Deliverance to the captives the recovery of sight to the blind to sit at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable ear of the Lord and he stopped now if you go back to Isaiah where he Isaiah 60 let's go over there real quick Isaiah 60 is purple one Isaiah 60 where he's where Jesus is quoting from this scripture Isaiah 60 he reads the very same thing and when you get to the second verse to proclaim the acceptable ear of the Lord and he stops and he didn't say and the day of Vengeance of our God now if you jump across the page or down down a little ways you'll find out on 63 verse 63 of I mean chapter 63 of that same of the book of Isaiah you'll find out it says the day of Vengeance on the footnotes on the top it says the day of Vengeance but then on the third verse of of chapter 63 it says this this is actually talking about Judgment Day it says I have troddened down the wine press wine press alone and I have and and of the people there was none with me and I I will tread them down in mine anger and trampled them in my Fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon the my garments and I will stained all my Remnant Raymond Raymond so you see if you're looking at at him stopping there it was his ministry he wasn't going he wasn't here to preach the great Judgment Day now if you go to Malachi Malachi for you drop over to Malachi 4 it's telling you of a judgment day let's drop over to Malachi 4. bear with me here Malachi fourth chapter it says you start on the fourth chapter at the beginning of the fourth chapter it says behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven that's the great Judgment Day that shall burn as an oven and the proud yea and all they that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up the day of judgment so Malachi 4 is talking about the day of judgment about the end time but you go over to Malachi 4 5 Verse 6 and it tells you that there's a Ministry for John the Baptist turning the hearts of the children I mean the of the fathers to the children turning the hearts of the fathers to the children John the Baptist but then there's a comma there and then the word and the hearts of the children to the fathers we know that's the ministry that came in our last day before the great and judgment great day of judgment and notice some of the aspects about that Ministry was back in verse about that Ministry is in in chapter 4 verse 2 but unto but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings so it's saying a Healing Ministry before the great judgment will be coming forth and we understand that that's what we're standing in we're recognizing that the message of this hour is showing us that they're going to be a Ministry of in Elijah to come that would bring a Healing Ministry amen so we start to see that God doesn't make any mistakes he doesn't put a period or a pause or a stop he doesn't stop for some reason it's for a reason that he stopped because there was a reason it was going to come in another time see when he when he he was going to come as the judge of of of the living and the dead in the great judgment day but it wasn't for the ministry he was presenting at that time he came to save the world he came to give his life for the world he came to pay the price he didn't come to bring judgment to the world at that time and there's where we all come in we all come in under that grace period and that grace period is what we can reach out to and hold on to we see that the ministry and that's what I want to speak about is the ministry we understand that a minister uh when you when you talk about Ministry Ministry isn't because they a person gets up here wanting to be served actually a minister is a servant to the people he's here to give his give to yield himself to yield himself to the spirit of God to be able to uh study and give his life and read and and and and and and and ask God to give him the understanding he said he can minister to the people he's more like a servant or a Slave or you could say Jesus called him to the 11th Hour workers they're workers so the ministry stands here as servants to the people to minister to the people not to be Jesus said to his disciples he says what were you guys talking about well we're wondering who was the greatest and he says you know I my example to you is not to to be served but to serve you know the Gentiles or exercise lordship but I came to you to tell you that the one who's great amongst you is your servant he's came to tell you the Way Up Is Down you got to humble yourself to be anything great you got to yield yourself to the spirit of God to do anything that's meaningful the Way Up Is Down and you start to understand that this ministry the ministry of the of the disciples Peter I mean it took him to to to deny the Lord and and and and cry bitterly and then and give a real sincere repentance and come back and then he he felt he was leading nothing and being another thing he could say silver or gold I don't have but what I do have I'll give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise to your feet see there's the difference it's not anything that a person can make of himself it's the person that'll yield himself to the spirit of God it that's what the ministry is all about and when we talk about Ministry I look at Lula Georgia I look at what your church has become remember that when we first came out we just came out because God sent a prophet and we saw the Miracles we saw the Miracles we saw the things that God was doing through the ministry and we said hey we got to get out of denomination we got away from denomination we got away from the the denominational ways and thinking and stuff but the advance to the ministry came in the humility in the humility of a people that has yielded to God that will raise up ministers and things that will say look I'm I'm nothing you're everything you know it's not a big me and a little you it's you it's you before God and it's come to the place where Lula Georgia is is doing a great job in serving the lord I listened to it on the on the broadcast and and I said man I says I wish I could preach like you guys you know I wish I could say the things you guys say I mean I I do take notes and I says if someday I'm going to copy what brother Bob is saying because someday I'm going to preach something like I'm going to mention some of the things he said I'm going to preach what brother Wade's saying because there's someday I'm going to say some of the things he says all the ministers your brother Aaron Brother you were a great preacher oh yeah you know I can see the and and the songs my goodness they raised me up and you say well uh uh you don't realize the impact it has Across the Nation everybody listens to you it's a blessing and you start to see that the the history of Lula Georgia it's making an impact to a bride around the world so till you stand to stand firm hold to God's unchanging hands you're living for God and it's the ministry is producing something and I'm I'm your one happy family and I realize that you know what you know I realize that you know when I stand back I says that's a place I'd you know at least there's no gossip there you know there's there's nobody saying anything about each other they're they're holy to God they're praying for each other you know so I start to look and I start to look at at Christianity as a whole and I look at the I look at the things that that that are going on you know I was looking at the history of of uh the seven Church ages now I'm talking about history like what the internet explains they they got people that are standing right there in Corinth at the ruins of Corinth and they're telling you what was going on at the time right after the book of Acts after Paul had already preached to them and brought out a Ministry and everything and what they went through and how it typed out to the Book of Revelations the seven Church ages and I started looking at them and I says you know what it must have been very hard you say Pagan is like oh we're not going to worship idols why are they have a problem with that worshiping idle to stuff like that but you know Christians don't have to worry about those things but think about it if a Christian in those days would would would would and and this this is some people went to death went to the they they actually wrote how they had to give their lives they they wrote their last Testament give you their lives because they wouldn't take that little handful of incense and drop it in a little pot of Fire in honor of the of the Caesar Caesar was called to God in honor of the Caesar because everybody who went into the marketplace had to throw that incense in and incense represented the prayers of the Saints and if you're going to drop that instance in what's God going to look at you like but they'd rather not go into the marketplace they'd rather get criticized they'd close their they'd close their business down if they didn't follow their Pagan ways and Christians gave their life for that Christians gave their lives to to to to not take part in that stuff and how many times would we we you know you stand there and you say well I'm gonna watch my television said I'm going to do this I'm gonna I'm gonna and it's not that I don't watch TV I was that's that actually I got that on YouTube okay but it's not that but but you realize that hey you don't have to watch the murders okay you don't have to watch the the the the investigations and the the things that are out there you don't have to watch the filth you don't have to watch the filthy commercials you don't have to watch all those things there's a there's a an anointing on you there there's a you you feel that that condemnation or the or the the the conscience in you that drives you to a higher colleague a higher calling in Christ you spend your time more in prayer asking God to please help so and so she's going through some pain please help so and so please raise them up give them bring them out of cancer bring them out of what they're dealing with because we recognize we we have that love joy peace love for each other amen so that that history of you know what it wasn't easy for those ones in the book of Acts it wasn't easy for Paul it wasn't easy for the brother in there that in the in the in the gospel they gave their lives for it how much more are we as Christians in our day because we're being witnessed you say I'm a witness I I wasn't there through brother Brown's campaigns I'm not a witness of those things yes you are as you read and you see the scriptures and you see the how the Bible ties together how the word comes to pass how the words producing how the faith that you guys have can bring you know if anybody's praying I know I I'm only saying Lord have Lula Georgia pray for my wife she's at the point of death and they did so you see there's the thing when when people call out to God and ask God God will step in the scene and I'm so grateful for those miracles for those prayers you know I know it wasn't easy for them for the people the Disciples of that day I know they gave their lives several of them were executed and and and and and and the Book of Martyrs started off in the book of Acts I know that happened but we stand in a day when this ministry is coming to a climax it's coming to A A place where they'll they'll they'll take their stand for this gospel that's been preached this word this this the the they they're they're uh there's a time you know when we look at where our part is in the in the scriptures when we look at our ministry you say well Lula I'm looking at Espanola where we go to church I'm looking at what brother Manuel's preaching and and things and I recognize that as he's preaching he's talking to talk about like the things that people shun at and they say well or or they get surprised or they'll say oh you can't say that you can't say I and the father are one you can't say uh uh uh Christ in me the hope of glory you can't say that you've got Jesus in you so well that you're perfect you know there is a people the scripture says be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect so you start to start to look at hey the end result of a Christian that met that that loves the Lord is going to become that his nature changes there in second Peter or yeah uh second Peter the first chapter it says be partakers of the divine nature there's only one divine nature being partakers of the Holy Ghost is being partakers of that divine nature and if you're going to be partakers of the divine nature you're going to have the nature of Christ in you and the nature of Christ in you isn't to say I'm holy holier than thou is to say through humility God has made me the Christian I ought to be God has made me the the living example to a world around me how do you become a living example to the world around you it's by the anointing of the Holy Spirit on your life amen amen we stay we stand here we look at Miracles we look at the things God's done we look at the ministry that this message has produced for us and we say well we know that there's got to be a falling away scripture says there is this Falling Away has happened already but it all depends if you're going to stay the ground or stay your way you know the the uh the the disciples the children of God the minister the people of God always stood their ground they stood their ground to say I believe in Jesus Christ no matter what the apop position wants to say what happens here they come they say oh you're going to believe in that Jesus Christ has said that you're going to have to eat his flesh and drink his blood that's cannibalism that's vampires what are you gonna do you say you know what some of them said I don't know why he said that I don't know why he said that I don't know what reason that he said that but he's right I don't know why that I can't explain the reasons that they go after the cloud but what brother Brown said the cloud was is good enough for me you know I don't have to go explain the Hulk it can't be a rocket or how it go how it's something else or what it is or all this I just stand there and say look the way the prophet of God explained it is good enough for me because you know what I don't see any of these critics opening some Blind Man's eyes I don't see any of these critics asking asking the Lord to or or praying over somebody and Cancer's getting well or or dead people coming to life I don't see any of those critics doing that I see the word of God being manifested through a vessel that's yielded to him and if I can become that same kind of vessel and I yield myself to him I'll start producing the very same thing amen the holy spirit in my life can produce the same things amen because it's why because it's a promise I've seen it throughout the whole word there's a promise of God for these for the manifestation of the sons of God and they're going to get stronger and stronger and stronger as we move into the last days amen and you can see this whole world's falling apart the world's falling apart I can go through and tell you about the things I see in in the that brother Brown had explained that are now coming to pass yeah I can tell you the events to me that are made clear by the prophecies yes I can tell you these things but you all are reading those things you know those things but what we're starting to see is that the manifestation of the sons of God it comes from a people a Praying people of faithful people a people that will seek God for every aspect of their lives they'll seek God for their brother they'll feel for their brother they'll feel for their sister when they're going through a trial you're going through a trial amen that it's it becomes a place where you you you you you call out to God for the for the for a for your brother your sister and it starts to produce and you uh a Ministry amen a Ministry that will manifest Jesus Christ amen as we look at the at the at the the power of God that's been manifested through the pillar of fire we notice what Ministry can say clearly the pillar fires back again you say well brother Daniel I haven't seen it in your day I haven't seen brother I don't have to see it to know it's there amen but yet yet beyond that point what are you going to do when it appears here are we looking for the sign or are we looking for the word the word says it's there the word shows you it's there the words manifesting that it's there and and when he when he comes back and raises the dead or heals the sick or or produces what the what the apostles have seen in the book of Acts you start to say look I recognize that through the manifestation of the word of God in my day it's become just a nature to you the nature of God in your life amen I can see that God's moving and as God's moving I can also see that hey the the the time is culminating or come it's coming to an end because I can see the cars that they're now working on there are going to drive themselves well they say well the Tesla didn't work it's just not doing that great but it's not stopping all the rest of the car companies for approaching looking for that it's not uh stopping the the it's not stopping our economy from taking its bust you know Rome's got to buy it out one day let me tell you your your your your your your the money you've been putting away into your retirement it's not what it used to be because because there's going to come a time when call Rome has to call back all the bonds and I can see Russia being threatened over there at the Ukraine and threatening he turns around Russia Russia turns around and says uh you bring in aircrafts into this war you bring in air for air support into this war and we're nuking the whole world a threat and everybody backed off oh he's going to Nuke the whole world but I mean we we know that the scripture says that the flesh will fall off their faces while they're still alive and the birds will come and eat them I mean we know that the what nukes gonna do you know but we recognize also the bride isn't going to take any part of that promise is that there won't be one nuke used in in war before the brides often gone so we're looking at promises that the god that God has promised his people so we look at at trying to well we look at our lives lining up is your life worthy of this gospel the Bible says is you're life worthy of the Gospel so we start stand back and we start to look at our lives do am I doing the right thing am I doing what God asked me to do am I praying the time am I putting my time am I praying am I asking God to manifest himself in my life am I asking God to to show himself am I asking God to manifest himself in my life so that I can be there at the time I'm needed amen amen so as we stand let's start to look at the at the things that God's doing in our in our day communion you know some of the things that God has done let's go ahead and stand and we'll uh start to get ready to close you know communion we stand here and we look at there's been a lot of things just like in Zechariah an angel of the Lord has appeared in our day the pillar of fire has appeared in our day we have the truth about communion with unleavened bread and and actually using wine instead of grape juice the way the denominations want to push it we have the truth about uh about Holiness you know when we when when we look at the whole world falling after after what it what it goes for in in dress and clothing and we look at this true Spirit of Holiness by the spirit of God that's been produced by the book of Acts or or in the
