[26:48] this is May June the July the third
[26:52] Saturday in July so just thank the Lord
[26:55] for that amen all right let's go right
[26:57] on the end brother Tom for Shane he's
[26:59] right up here to the front let's get him
[27:01] to come up and get his family and all of
[27:03] them to come and they want us to come to
[27:05] sing for us
[27:08] praise the Lord
[27:10] it's real good to be here it's good to
[27:12] see everybody coming in
[27:13] it's a great message that we are in it's
[27:17] one of the most astounding things there
[27:19] the most astounding thing to ever hit my
[27:21] life
[27:22] you know I never knew there would come a
[27:24] day when I would prefer to hear the
[27:26] preaching of the Plan of Redemption
[27:30] better than if we had 50 experts to
[27:32] teach me how to be a better man I would
[27:35] rather hear the word preached over a
[27:37] four week period than to have 50 experts
[27:40] on Behavior to make me a better man
[27:42] because once you're done with all those
[27:45] experts you might do okay during their
[27:47] teaching but then when they're done
[27:49] you're done but when you're taught these
[27:52] things that feed your soul and it
[27:54] becomes a part of you it's never done
[27:56] because it's eternal
[27:58] you know I I knew of a fella he went to
[28:01] prison in in one prison he went they
[28:03] didn't alarm to drink or to smoke and
[28:05] they had been a drinker and a smoker
[28:07] most of his life for the next 18 months
[28:09] he didn't drink or smoke and that's
[28:11] pretty good
[28:12] but then they transferred them to a
[28:13] different prison that allowed smoking
[28:15] and within a week he was back to smoking
[28:18] I know why because that Spirit was still
[28:20] there
[28:21] and the message of the hour is not for
[28:23] the carnal mind it doesn't even make
[28:25] sense and it's it's actually including
[28:27] the Bible I'll say with it filled with
[28:29] things that don't make sense to the
[28:31] carnal mind it just is you look up on
[28:33] the internet and there's thousands of
[28:35] websites about the mistakes in the Bible
[28:37] but see that's the carnal realm and
[28:39] that's where they're thinking where we
[28:40] are have gained such a strength that we
[28:43] are surviving as God feeds our spiritual
[28:45] man
[28:46] you know I just wanted to read one
[28:48] scripture is that okay and I'll just
[28:49] take a couple minutes
[28:51] but it a scripture that had struck me
[28:53] just recently of course I turned to the
[28:56] wrong one it's that over 50 thing
[29:01] over 50 thing
[29:04] let me just quick read it therefore
[29:06] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[29:08] of Christ let's go on unto Perfection
[29:10] not laying again the foundation of
[29:13] repentance from dead Works into Faith
[29:15] toward god of the doctrine of baptism of
[29:17] laying on the hands and of the of
[29:20] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[29:22] judgment and this will we do if God
[29:25] permit but I have learned that the
[29:28] message of the hour was not a Revival of
[29:30] the do's and the don'ts because that was
[29:33] the original Foundation that a sinner
[29:35] needed to know that they shouldn't do
[29:37] this and they ought to get away from
[29:38] this so that they could receive Christ
[29:40] but brother sister were waiting on a
[29:42] Rapture Amen in the rapture we have to
[29:45] lay those principles down not that we
[29:48] stop those things but we do those things
[29:50] now because of the life that's in us I
[29:53] don't wake up in the morning go oh no
[29:54] should I pay tithes or not this week my
[29:57] wife doesn't say I wonder if I should
[29:58] cut my hair this week or not because
[30:00] although those are truths those are not
[30:03] things that the message is about right
[30:05] if that be sold in our Pentecostal
[30:07] brothers and some even Baptist churches
[30:09] are now laying that Foundation again
[30:11] it's actually a better Foundation than
[30:13] what they have right now they may have
[30:15] to lay again the same Foundation but not
[30:17] the Bride of Jesus Christ we're looking
[30:19] to get off this Earth and that's the
[30:21] next thing that's going to happen every
[30:24] single age that ever had a prophet the
[30:26] prophet was always rejected
[30:28] you know I I thought of theory Erasmus
[30:30] lately and someone mentioned him today
[30:32] but uh brother Thierry Rasmus went on to
[30:34] be with the Lord but he did a great work
[30:36] out in Africa in different places and
[30:38] and the government took notice of it and
[30:40] they called him Theory Erasmus Branham
[30:43] and why because he was Affiliated so
[30:45] close to this message and I remember a
[30:47] couple few years back now my stepmom
[30:50] died and I was out in Virginia preaching
[30:52] and my family didn't know where I was
[30:54] and I didn't have a cell phone back in
[30:56] them days and so they said how do we
[30:58] even get to Tom so he can come to the
[31:00] funeral and I have a sister who's uh
[31:02] she's been taught against the message so
[31:04] she went up on the internet and looked
[31:06] up the name William Branham and and
[31:09] clicked on the First Church website she
[31:11] saw and she called the number that she
[31:13] saw and she said do you know where Tom
[31:14] Cruise Shane's well sure brother Tom's
[31:16] up in Virginia
[31:18] so if you type in the name William
[31:20] Branham on the internet you'll find me
[31:24] and that's fine with me
[31:26] isn't that good and she was astounded
[31:30] because uh there's there's got all
[31:32] Vindicated all the time just all the
[31:35] time and I asked the church to keep
[31:36] praying for my Amy she's she just
[31:38] stopped sleeping she stopped uh resting
[31:41] and after about three four five days of
[31:43] that her mind started slipping and just
[31:45] in and out she's been in the hospital
[31:47] now for five weeks and she's telling
[31:49] them all she's still healed and that
[31:51] she's a Christian and Every Time We
[31:52] Touch she says I'm a daughter of God and
[31:54] she's been talking to people there and
[31:57] I'll leave with one quick witness you
[31:58] know there they say she's obsessive but
[32:01] she's trying not to be but one woman
[32:03] there was talking openly about
[32:04] committing suicide and she had two
[32:06] children
[32:07] and my aiming got to talking well how
[32:09] about your children won't you miss your
[32:11] babies Oh yes I'll miss my babies and
[32:13] they kept talking and Amy said well you
[32:15] know she she said a few things her
[32:17] brother Brahms taught about it and she
[32:19] said you know if you do commit suicide
[32:22] how will your babies be able to miss you
[32:25] anymore and she began to talk and two
[32:27] days later they'd let that woman out and
[32:29] the medication team talked to her says
[32:31] well what made the change she said well
[32:33] really I talked to Amy crocheting and
[32:35] she told me a few things to encourage me
[32:37] and you know this message is so alive
[32:39] and I remember we went to visit her and
[32:41] we uh stopped by a coffee shop on the
[32:44] way back home and my daughter Anna likes
[32:47] the coffee and so I didn't want to go
[32:49] but we went anyway
[32:51] and when we got in there we we paired
[32:53] over a meal and I noticed a young man
[32:54] sitting with the Bible and so did my
[32:56] daughter Sarah he had a Bible and a
[32:58] couple other books uh being really saved
[33:01] or something like that and I looked over
[33:02] and I took a tiny notice maybe he saw us
[33:04] praying and my daughter Sarah took
[33:07] notice of him and uh she bowed her head
[33:09] and she prayed she said dear Lord God if
[33:11] he's the seed of God would you have him
[33:12] come talk to us it seemed like about a
[33:14] minute later and I don't have it perfect
[33:16] but I have something like that a minute
[33:18] later he got up and he said hey I have
[33:20] to go to the outside or to the bathroom
[33:21] and would you hold all my stuff and he
[33:23] began to talk to sure we will so we went
[33:26] out when he come back I said young man
[33:27] why don't you just sit right there and
[33:28] we began to talk about the message of
[33:30] the hour for the next two hours this is
[33:33] very very and uh We've we found out he's
[33:35] in a rough situation his parents are
[33:37] divorced his mom's alcoholic he's having
[33:40] a rough time I says well what's your
[33:42] name he says well Caleb this is well
[33:44] Caleb your very own name tells me what
[33:46] you need
[33:48] and we began to tell him he says but
[33:50] there's no more miracles after the
[33:52] apostles and I'm like let me talk to you
[33:54] a few minutes and you know so maybe
[33:56] we'll see Caleb again so even in our
[33:58] hard times good things can come of it
[34:01] this message will hold us through but
[34:03] remember this message is it'll help you
[34:05] even in the carnal realm it'll make you
[34:07] a good clean living person if I couldn't
[34:09] get the Holy Ghost I'd still be in the
[34:10] message because it's a better life but
[34:12] the message of the hours to feed your
[34:14] soul you actually leave behind that old
[34:17] fella named Tom Christian that's the one
[34:19] I want to leave him behind because some
[34:22] things you can't quit but you can't
[34:23] leave them behind
[34:24] and if you're leaving behind and you
[34:26] press towards the great things of God
[34:28] that's why I can't wait to hear the
[34:29] preaching because the preaching fills my
[34:31] mind in my heart with the things of God
[34:35] and then I can press forward and then I
[34:38] think on good things amen so it's real
[34:41] good to be here I just love brother Dale

[1:06:39] I guess that's all of the
[1:06:41] churches the ministers okay you know we
[1:06:47] we had brother Ernie Villanueva
[1:06:49] scheduled to be with us this weekend and
[1:06:51] to preach for us but he was not able to
[1:06:54] come and uh so we had to get someone
[1:06:57] else and we're glad to always that
[1:06:58] somebody can help us and Minister for us
[1:07:01] and things you don't do and we
[1:07:02] appreciate it but what we're going to do
[1:07:05] today is uh you know
[1:07:08] if we're not going to take up another
[1:07:10] offering because I'm not one of those
[1:07:12] kind of guys you know people say well
[1:07:15] let's take up an offer to this and up
[1:07:16] and offer that of an offering this
[1:07:18] nothing first thing you know you got
[1:07:19] four or five offerings but what we're
[1:07:21] going to do the offering that was given
[1:07:24] today brother Ernie is not able to work
[1:07:27] because of what they call the neuropathy
[1:07:31] or something with his feet that he's not
[1:07:34] able to travel to do anything and uh you
[1:07:37] know we have I know churches have helped
[1:07:40] him we have helped him and he thanks God
[1:07:42] for all of that but what we'll do is
[1:07:46] when you were leaving tonight the
[1:07:48] offering plate parents will be holding
[1:07:50] it back there and if you have anything
[1:07:52] else the offering that you gave will go
[1:07:55] to brother
[1:07:56] Ernie you know to try to help him some
[1:07:59] and and bless him you know and all and
[1:08:01] take care of his needs but he said I
[1:08:03] talked to him the other day we had
[1:08:05] waited and waited and prayed and prayed
[1:08:07] and the last time I talked with him he
[1:08:10] said it was even a problem to try to go
[1:08:12] even to the grocery store because your
[1:08:15] feet goes numb and uh you don't know
[1:08:18] what's going on in them and they hurt
[1:08:20] const leaf with what they say with that
[1:08:23] so if you pray for him hold him up Let
[1:08:25] the Lord would bless him but we will
[1:08:27] send him the offering from today from
[1:08:30] everybody you know the fellowship
[1:08:32] meeting people so if you have anything
[1:08:34] else you want to give just make sure you
[1:08:36] do if you want to make a check out or
[1:08:38] anything to go ahead and make it out to
[1:08:40] a spoken word church and we'll make sure
[1:08:42] that it's handled and given unto him you
[1:08:45] know because that would would be all
[1:08:47] right okay but we appreciate the
[1:08:50] opportunity of you of coming here and
[1:08:52] being in the service today and pray that
[1:08:54] the Lord would bless each and every one
[1:08:56] of us
[1:08:57] you know we're living as someone said a
[1:09:00] moment ago we're living in some horrible
[1:09:01] times and things are going wrong all
[1:09:04] around the world
[1:09:05] but the worst problem is that we're
[1:09:07] living in a time when people are turning
[1:09:09] against the word you know and and
[1:09:12] actually turning down this message and
[1:09:15] those who used to swear by it and
[1:09:17] brought many of us into this message are
[1:09:21] the ones now that are saying it was
[1:09:22] wrong and how false the prophet is and
[1:09:25] the things like that but you know what
[1:09:27] they wouldn't dare say that when he was
[1:09:29] yes sir
[1:09:31] and uh I'm kind of like this I'm still
[1:09:35] to the point that I'm just old-fashioned
[1:09:37] enough to think that either this message
[1:09:40] is right or wrong
[1:09:41] and as long as I believe it to be right
[1:09:45] then I'm going to stand up for it and
[1:09:48] I'm going to say those who do not
[1:09:50] believe it or have got their problems
[1:09:51] not me because they didn't give it to me
[1:09:55] and they can't take it from me and you
[1:09:58] know if they come up with all these
[1:10:00] ideas that brother Brown was wrong here
[1:10:02] and wronged our well you know I just say
[1:10:05] to you and that's especially going out
[1:10:07] on the internet waves to the people and
[1:10:09] you go back and tell the people of
[1:10:10] brotherdale believes it that way you
[1:10:12] know if you can correct brother Brown
[1:10:13] and we need to follow you yep well if
[1:10:16] you can't see that's what that spirit is
[1:10:18] on the people
[1:10:21] the spirit on these preachers is wanting
[1:10:23] people to follow them
[1:10:26] no brother he's a good brother yeah he's
[1:10:28] a good lying hypocrite
[1:10:31] is any stronger I could make it
[1:10:34] that's as much as he's a good Pope come
[1:10:38] on but the Bible's right you know what
[1:10:41] it says said there must be a falling
[1:10:44] away first
[1:10:47] right
[1:10:49] will you think about that scripture
[1:10:51] you can't fall away if you ain't
[1:10:54] somewhere to fall from
[1:10:56] right you can't fall off of the Empire
[1:10:59] State Building
[1:11:00] unless you're on top of it
[1:11:04] and see the people that's been in this
[1:11:05] message are the ones now falling away
[1:11:07] well that's exactly scriptural
[1:11:11] but you said but those are good Brothers
[1:11:14] so it's a pope
[1:11:16] I put them all in the same category
[1:11:19] no difference
[1:11:22] they're good people sure we're all human
[1:11:26] but if this message is right let's
[1:11:27] follow it and forget the rest of it
[1:11:31] because I've never found the wrong in it
[1:11:33] amen me either I'll put it out there is
[1:11:37] a challenge on the internet come and
[1:11:38] show me
[1:11:40] come and show me where the Prophet was
[1:11:42] wrong
[1:11:45] well at least I'm trying to be honest
[1:11:48] come and show me
[1:11:49] well this or that come and show let's
[1:11:52] get together
[1:11:54] I think it's time for the Bride of Jesus
[1:11:56] Christ to stand up and do as brother
[1:11:58] Branham said he said I'll be glad when
[1:12:01] it comes a day that they'll look to
[1:12:02] people in the eye and say you're not
[1:12:04] saying what Paul said
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] man why is it they don't come around
[1:12:12] here
[1:12:15] you know
[1:12:17] because they know they're not going to
[1:12:19] be welcomed
[1:12:21] right
[1:12:24] but you see that sister's honest as it
[1:12:26] can be
[1:12:27] straight as I can be
[1:12:29] in truth I can be about I believe the
[1:12:31] message
[1:12:32] we know brother random made human errors
[1:12:34] humans mistakes slips of the tongue
[1:12:38] sure because he was a human being
[1:12:41] and you do too
[1:12:43] and I do too
[1:12:44] you know
[1:12:47] but yet God sent us a message
[1:12:51] and if he didn't send this man then
[1:12:53] somebody's got to come
[1:12:56] so can't you see what all these
[1:12:57] preachers are doing they're building it
[1:12:59] back to themselves
[1:13:03] and that's between him and the Lord
[1:13:06] I just believe the message
[1:13:08] I ain't worried about it this message
[1:13:10] brought me to Jesus Christ
[1:13:16] and if the man turned out to be false is
[1:13:19] a
[1:13:20] three dollar bill
[1:13:21] I would still praise God for the message
[1:13:24] that brought me to Christ
[1:13:27] but then if I believe it's the message
[1:13:29] he brought me to Christ how can it be
[1:13:31] wrong
[1:13:38] Martin Luther was a trinitarian
[1:13:44] smoked a pot was sitting in a pub
[1:13:47] drinking beer talking about the Lord
[1:13:50] and said to Jews or to be took out and
[1:13:52] killed
[1:13:53] for Killing Jesus Christ
[1:13:58] but you know what
[1:14:00] I still believe the just shall live by
[1:14:04] faith
[1:14:06] I still believe what he taught of the
[1:14:08] truth don't you
[1:14:10] so do I about this message it has
[1:14:12] brought Christ to us
[1:14:15] because that is the point we did amen
[1:14:18] all mine's clear let's stand together we
[1:14:21] have Brother Richard Douglas brother Tim
[1:14:23] Humes Church the minister for us today
[1:14:27] and just pray that the Lord would bless
[1:14:29] him and give him the words
[1:14:31] that we would have for today because
[1:14:33] that's our desire
[1:14:35] to come together and fellowship around
[1:14:38] the word of the hour
[1:14:39] and to love him and to praise His great
[1:14:42] name because he's wonderful didn't he
[1:14:45] let's just saying Open the Eyes of My
[1:14:47] Heart as Brother Richard Douglas comes
[1:14:49] to minister the word of the Lord unto us
[1:14:51] this day
