[0:00] like that's it what are we doing here
[0:01] we're we we're going around more of them
[0:03] we just keep continually going around
[0:05] and moving around
[0:08] it's like i tried to explain to them out
[0:10] there in oklahoma
[0:15] and let's just make this a total analogy
[0:17] of everybody if
[0:19] if if what we're doing produces red
[0:23] and red's not the body change
[0:26] then if we keep doing what we're doing
[0:28] remember what the definition of insanity
[0:29] is
[0:31] the definition of an insanity is doing
[0:33] the same thing over again expecting a
[0:36] different result
[0:38] everybody got that
[0:40] yes insanity is it doing like like drunk
[0:43] i've been living that for a while yeah
[0:45] like a drunk
[0:47] a drunk will get drunk
[0:50] let's just be honest
[0:52] some of you may have been there some of
[0:53] you not got drunk throw up
[0:57] say i'll never do this again
[0:59] i ain't never going through this no more
[1:03] till next friday night
[1:06] then they do the same thing over again
[1:08] expecting
[1:10] a different result yeah well that's what
[1:12] that's what i was trying to talk speak
[1:14] to them out there in oklahoma is
[1:16] chang we got to change something
[1:17] something's got to that we're getting
[1:19] the same result
[1:21] if red is not the body change and what
[1:23] we're doing is producing red then we
[1:24] need to change what we're doing to
[1:26] produce green
[1:29] my brother dale's always said if you
[1:31] start with a black dog in genesis you
[1:32] need to end with a white dog in
[1:33] revelation so then it's continuity we
[1:35] must keep continuity
[1:37] our continuity is not just believing
[1:39] that brother branham was a prophet
[1:46] he was he still is a prophet i correct
[1:49] people all the time brother brown was a
[1:50] prophet not was he still is
[1:53] but he's across current time he's a
[1:54] prophet right but that prophet is
[1:57] gone yes
[1:59] the real one he introduced was this one
[2:01] right here and that's christ when christ
[2:03] came down on sunset mountain
[2:06] threw william branham he introduced
[2:08] christ like like no one else had
[2:10] introduced him
[2:12] even john the baptist
[2:14] because remember the least in the
[2:16] kingdom is greater than john the baptist
[2:18] john was there to introduce jesus the
[2:20] first time
[2:21] and if you'll notice
[2:23] not taking away from anything of william
[2:25] brown on the person
[2:26] but remember the angel never said you
[2:28] will forerun the second coming of christ
[2:30] read your clothes
[2:32] the angel said your message will forerun
[2:36] the second coming of christ when i see
[2:37] the messenger is gone but the message is
[2:39] continuing on
[2:42] to get christ here
[2:44] amen and it's full form right
[2:46] which is the statue of a perfect man
[2:48] that's god that was jesus walking on the
[2:50] shores of galilee
[2:52] right
[2:52] that was the fullness of the godhead
[2:54] bodily from here down all right
[2:57] so now we're going to continue
[3:00] can anybody see that
[3:04] you know carefully okay i changed the
[3:06] fonts to make it as big as it could
[3:07] that's the biggest font they got right
[3:09] so
[3:10] let's read this right here now this is
[3:11] from blasphemous names now remember
[3:14] this is the end of the dream of sister
[3:16] shepard all right she kind of give you a
[3:18] background this is the end of her dream
[3:20] five streams is pouring up from here
[3:22] into that trough down here remember the
[3:24] man put honey in the box which was
[3:26] brotherly love
[3:27] see there's your keystone brotherly
[3:29] kindness that when he was pointed in
[3:30] that box remember the stuff was coming
[3:32] out
[3:33] but once he put that
[3:36] honey in which was brotherly kindness
[3:38] that held so that god could fill the
[3:40] person up completely
[3:42] because remember without brotherly
[3:44] kindness
[3:46] these kind of follow in line with each
[3:48] other
[3:50] these follow in line with each other
[3:53] and you keep having virtue but now once
[3:54] you get right up here you're getting
[3:56] right up to the top where everything's
[3:58] pushing up to the top
[4:00] and then there's a bar right there
[4:05] so that's where the faith of the father
[4:06] that's where peter james john paul
[4:09] all your new testament early church
[4:13] had the faith of the father so see
[4:16] the faith of the fathers and the virtues
[4:18] are not something new
[4:21] see brother brown didn't come to preach
[4:22] a new way to get the virtues
[4:25] peter showed us how to get them in ii
[4:27] peter it's been since 2000 years ago but
[4:30] it's been laying in the bible
[4:33] man's read over them but not been able
[4:35] to put them together to attain to that
[4:38] so we had a prophet come in the end time
[4:41] that's why brother brown had to come he
[4:43] had to take the loose ends he had to put
[4:45] this
[4:46] back together go into
[4:49] where is it where zerubbabel builds them
[4:51] builds them
[4:53] hey uh anyway zechariah
[4:56] zechariah right
[4:57] zerubbabel was a real man
[5:00] now what happened with zerubbabel jeruba
[5:02] was the one that they come in and
[5:05] beforehand that somebody had destroyed
[5:07] the temple
[5:08] i mean laid it to the foundation
[5:10] destroyed it
[5:11] zerubbabel's job was to build that
[5:14] fountain to start on the foundation that
[5:16] was already there and build the temple
[5:18] back up okay so what happened in type is
[5:22] down through the ages man has
[5:24] done away with the temple
[5:28] done away with the way this thing's
[5:29] supposed to live or the scriptures are
[5:31] supposed to be read
[5:32] so it was swept off
[5:35] and then zerubbabel
[5:37] the prophet
[5:39] come and starts putting the building
[5:41] back up
[5:42] all right watch elijah
[5:44] we know that brother branham was the
[5:45] what the fourth spirit of elijah right
[5:48] elijah elisha john the baptist brother
[5:51] brown and then one of the two witnesses
[5:53] going to jews that's the five comings of
[5:55] elijah now what did elijah do what did
[5:58] the original elijah do on mount carmel
[6:02] those priests tore the ark toward the
[6:08] sacrifice
[6:09] the oh thank you system throw the altar
[6:11] down
[6:12] right right they jumped on it beat on it
[6:15] cut themselves
[6:16] the bible says elijah
[6:19] put the altar back together well let's
[6:21] see that's what brother rem did he put
[6:23] that altar back the way the worship back
[6:25] together he didn't bring something new
[6:27] right
[6:29] he was just restoring back
[6:32] remember brother brown said this
[6:34] messenger of elijah does two things
[6:36] restore
[6:37] the faith of the fathers to the
[6:39] pentecostal babies faith of the fathers
[6:41] pentecostal babies
[6:43] through the street pentecost started
[6:46] with the holy ghost right here in faith
[6:48] down here right
[6:50] now original pentecost
[6:53] original pentecost
[6:55] paul p i'm not paul sorry james john
[6:58] peter the ones in the upper room when
[7:00] they were birthed into the body when god
[7:02] gave them the holy ghost they were right
[7:03] here
[7:05] had these virtues working in their life
[7:07] because they were tutored by god
[7:09] almighty himself for three and a half
[7:10] years they're the greatest preachers
[7:12] ever come on the face of the earth
[7:15] we had the second greatest preacher to
[7:16] come on the face of the earth
[7:18] brother brown to do what he had to do to
[7:20] bring everything back together
[7:21] and jesus was doing the same thing he
[7:23] was taking the old testament
[7:26] right tell him say hey
[7:29] temples are okay and buildings are okay
[7:32] sacrifices are okay
[7:35] but now that's all right here
[7:37] you know what jesus was doing so he was
[7:39] taking the old testament and bringing it
[7:41] into the new testament which is in my
[7:43] blood he said not the blood of bulls and
[7:45] goats that's the old testament right the
[7:46] new testament was a tech new testament
[7:49] in my blood
[7:50] so jesus was telling say hey this is the
[7:52] temple now
[7:53] then he goes out comes back on the day
[7:55] of pentecost and he says now you're the
[7:57] temple
[7:59] right right you're the temple
[8:02] no you're not you're the temple the holy
[8:03] ghost that's why we don't do the things
[8:04] that we did out in the world sure we
[8:06] have problems when we have problems we
[8:08] have tribulation but when you're a
[8:09] born-again christian you changed
[8:14] right you've changed and i ain't talking
[8:16] about just change one item
[8:18] that's right no you changed
[8:20] i drove by
[8:22] baptist church just a few minutes ago
[8:24] and they have an early church nine
[8:25] o'clock
[8:27] man gets out of his car with a pair of
[8:29] shorts on
[8:32] going into church
[8:34] with a pair of shorts on
[8:37] women with their pants on
[8:41] but you see what's happened
[8:43] man has rejected the word and once
[8:45] they've rejected the word i was reading
[8:46] it last night brother brown said they
[8:48] have become lodges
[8:52] so that's all they are they're just a
[8:54] meeting place
[8:55] for like the elves club or
[8:58] i'm sorry but that's what he said
[9:00] he said it's just a good fellows lodge a
[9:02] place to go to lodge and i don't want
[9:04] that to be here i don't want just to
[9:05] come together just to be a lodge
[9:07] or for us to just come and say well i
[9:09] gotta come to church you know i hate
[9:12] this it's something i hate i hate
[9:13] somebody say i gotta come to church so
[9:15] they won't say anything about me
[9:17] or i gotta go to church or brother
[9:18] wade's gonna preach on no if you don't
[9:20] have a desire to come to church yourself
[9:22] you're not born again
[9:24] period and it ain't me
[9:26] it's not me you're not what did peter
[9:28] say peter said you you're not lying
[9:30] against the holy ghost i mean you're not
[9:31] lying against me you're lying against
[9:32] the holy ghost right
[9:34] what do you think there's a song that we
[9:36] sing there are places where i
[9:38] can't go yeah i say where i won't go
[9:41] yeah because i can go with my life you
[9:43] can
[9:44] we're still free moral agents
[9:46] but we and you know what god and that's
[9:49] why i think about these virtues once you
[9:51] say god i know i need knowledge
[9:54] boy he's so happy with that
[9:56] i love it when deanna comes up and says
[9:58] papa i need you to help me in this mat
[10:00] with this math
[10:01] problem now boy you talking about making
[10:03] me feel good i wouldn't care if you
[10:04] handed me ten thousand dollars i'd give
[10:06] you the ten thousand back and took what
[10:08] she said because you know what that's
[10:10] part of me
[10:11] that's the virtue she's drawing from me
[10:13] the strength she's throwing for me and
[10:14] it may just be carnal and natural which
[10:16] that's okay but still the way it makes
[10:19] me feel well see that's the same way
[10:21] with god when you go to god and say god
[10:23] i can't understand what brother dale's
[10:25] saying
[10:26] but you said that even an illiterate
[10:28] person could understand this so you're
[10:30] gonna have to help me and you know what
[10:32] he's like
[10:35] greater than 10 billion worlds to him
[10:37] you know when you come to daddy and say
[10:38] daddy i need some help what are you
[10:39] going to say i'm just going to say
[10:41] brother said
[10:42] if god said i heard
[10:44] we can't wait i can't wait for the doors
[10:46] though that's right
[10:48] that's what i said many people in the
[10:49] scripture it says that much more as a
[10:50] day approaches i think people think
[10:52] we're going backwards
[10:54] and not approaching today because
[10:57] i guess one service fills you up now
[11:01] but you know what it's not a ritual
[11:03] though it should never be a ritual
[11:05] that's right
[11:06] it should never be that i'm going to
[11:07] come to church so that brother wade
[11:09] won't get onto me
[11:11] that's wrong you need to stay at home
[11:13] right but you know what if you stay at
[11:14] home you ain't got god in your heart
[11:16] right
[11:17] so
[11:18] you you can go here or there whatever
[11:20] you want to i told them out in oklahoma
[11:22] about
[11:23] brother ryan and sister gabby
[11:25] and
[11:26] uh we'll get to part with this one today
[11:30] but i told them about them their baby
[11:31] laying in the hospital in the intensive
[11:34] care unit and they are in
[11:36] you know what they're honoring god god
[11:38] said put
[11:39] me first that's right now you think
[11:42] that's something some people looked at
[11:44] me like they you know they were crazy
[11:47] i said listen
[11:49] a man walked out of the woods one day
[11:53] and there was a drought in the land
[11:57] he probably ain't had a bath in months
[11:59] hair down to here in the bible said he
[12:01] had camel hair around his waist
[12:04] he walks up to a widow woman that don't
[12:06] even have a husband
[12:10] am i okay
[12:12] i'm gonna preach this morning he walks
[12:14] up to a widow woman
[12:16] they don't have but one
[12:18] little handful of meal left
[12:21] they ain't got walmart to go to they
[12:24] don't have anywhere she's got one hand
[12:26] she said i'm gonna she probably got up
[12:28] that morning and said look son
[12:30] because she had a son she said son it's
[12:32] all we got
[12:33] i'm gonna bait this and feed it to you
[12:35] because i don't want you to die first
[12:37] because that's what it said right you
[12:39] know what the bible said
[12:41] a man a stranger walks up
[12:46] picks me some of that bread
[12:49] you know what he said
[12:50] he didn't
[12:54] yeah he said you made me one first
[12:57] now how many of you
[13:02] would have slammed the door in a man's
[13:03] face and said you go find your own
[13:07] when you've got a kid that's probably
[13:10] 50 pounds underweight having to eat and
[13:12] he's fixing to eat his last meal and a
[13:14] stranger walks up that looks like a bum
[13:17] off the street and goes you fix me one
[13:20] first
[13:24] that's what i thought about when i
[13:25] thought about them
[13:27] see we seek other things and you know
[13:29] jesus said
[13:31] he's even talking about funeral he said
[13:34] you should forsake father mother sister
[13:37] brother a lot of you and i'm gonna go
[13:38] and let it out a lot of you some of you
[13:40] kids will come to your house and you'll
[13:41] out of church that's wrong
[13:44] you're giving them an impression that
[13:46] they are more important now i'm going to
[13:48] tell you something my father-in-law
[13:50] he comes to my house on sunday
[13:52] he knows for a fact he's either going to
[13:54] sit there by himself or he's going to
[13:56] come to church with us there's not an
[13:57] option right because you know what
[13:59] you're presenting to them something
[14:02] wrong if you put them first
[14:04] sorry
[14:06] jesus said for say father mother sister
[14:09] brother and follow me but you know what
[14:11] seek ye first the kingdom of heaven
[14:14] then all these other things what we do
[14:15] is we
[14:17] we have fear
[14:19] that god's not going to do what he says
[14:21] that's why we're still here that's the
[14:22] bottom line
[14:24] we're afraid that god can't do and what
[14:26] was eve's problem
[14:29] eve's problem was she was afraid that
[14:32] god couldn't produce what he said he was
[14:33] going to produce that's what brother
[14:34] brown said right so she went ahead of
[14:37] god's program and produced
[14:39] well look at this this is what she
[14:40] produced
[14:42] evil you know all this stuff brother oh
[14:45] hey oh i got a message on my phone for
[14:48] my wife
[14:50] in the hospital
[14:51] he said we've got 20 angels in my life
[14:54] jillian's asleep the nylon is playing
[14:56] and one's reading
[15:07] before we went to the doctor's office i
[15:09] asked i said come sit down
[15:13] and i held a hand to pray
[15:15] i said don't let the day be a change for
[15:17] my life
[15:19] and by that night at four o'clock she
[15:20] was in there
[15:23] so
[15:24] y'all but you know what you've got to
[15:27] see a change in your life
[15:28] you're the head you're the head
[15:30] you're the head to be honest really we
[15:32] all we're the head we're talking about
[15:33] this last night remember we talked about
[15:35] them
[15:36] we always talk about homosexuality and
[15:38] everybody what's the first thing when
[15:39] somebody says homosexual what do you
[15:40] think of male 1
[15:42] the bible doesn't say that
[15:44] the women became
[15:46] affected with each other first likewise
[15:48] the men because if the women turn
[15:50] against the men the men's going to do
[15:51] something is proven by the priest
[15:54] priests can't have wives so what do they
[15:55] do they know that's kids it's a spirit i
[15:57] mean it's a spirit that we get on it
[16:01] and it's a demon his own sister martha
[16:03] honestly it's the devil
[16:06] we don't need to pray for her as much as
[16:08] we need to pray that she'll be strong
[16:10] and we'll be strong with her to drive
[16:12] that unclean spirit out because it can
[16:14] do we can do that as a bride of jesus
[16:16] christ we are stronger than any demon
[16:19] that's right amen but now what we do is
[16:21] though we have fear
[16:23] and that's why i told ryan
[16:25] i said you take that fear into that room
[16:28] with that baby she has no defense
[16:30] against that that's right you understand
[16:32] what i'm saying they really enjoy that
[16:34] in oklahoma you got to think that
[16:36] because remember
[16:38] we'll do this next time
[16:40] remember
[16:42] a human doctor
[16:44] is only trying to keep your body
[16:48] alive so that your soul will stay in
[16:51] your body
[16:52] you got that
[16:54] because they cannot cure your soul
[16:57] they cannot cure your spirit
[16:59] they can only try to make that body
[17:02] function
[17:03] to keep that soul in that body now
[17:05] that's what a doctor's to do right
[17:08] so it doesn't matter then how many
[17:10] cubes are sticking in the child baby man
[17:13] whoever it doesn't matter what their you
[17:15] know the doctor says well she knows she
[17:17] needs this and he needs this
[17:20] they're just trying but see you and i
[17:22] though
[17:23] we're soul
[17:25] that's why i was telling ryan i said
[17:26] ryan you go in that room remember i said
[17:28] you go in that room with fear that
[17:30] baby's going to feel fear and it's gonna
[17:32] have a problem because it has nothing in
[17:34] that soul to combat that
[17:36] it's just a baby don't know any
[17:38] different but when you take a situation
[17:41] and you take the fear out and you walk
[17:43] in and say by his stripes they're healed
[17:45] and i'm not looking at how many cubes
[17:47] are stuck in that baby i'm not looking
[17:49] at how much
[17:50] this
[17:51] chart is remember brother branham with
[17:52] the man and the woman
[17:55] the the nurse says they're dying right
[17:58] they're dying
[17:59] that poor old man just put his arms
[18:00] around and says honey you're looking at
[18:02] your machines
[18:04] you're just looking at your machines
[18:05] well that's why i'm coming you're just
[18:06] looking at the machine
[18:08] the machine is trying to keep the body
[18:10] there
[18:11] go into the sole go into that soul of
[18:15] that person that's where this comes from
[18:18] virtue
[18:20] virtue came out of peter silver and gold
[18:22] have i none but such as i have he didn't
[18:24] have to go find it
[18:26] he didn't have to go call somebody he
[18:28] already had it
[18:29] so that's the same way with these
[18:30] virtues and as we start next sunday
[18:33] because we're going to have to head this
[18:34] thing up in christ and it's not that
[18:36] christ is coming
[18:37] he's already here
[18:39] okay he's here
[18:42] yes he was here
[18:44] and and let's not
[18:48] let's not think of this as
[18:51] because you go and this is from partial
[18:53] to perfect this is the same thing
[18:55] everybody understand that
[18:57] this is partial faith well
[19:00] listen
[19:01] if you gotta if you've got one teaspoon
[19:04] of ocean water brother around anybody
[19:06] told this this is real simple but very
[19:08] profound
[19:09] if you take one teaspoon
[19:11] now you've got every ingredient that's
[19:14] in the ocean that's billions and
[19:15] billions and billions of gallons you've
[19:18] got every element
[19:21] that's in that
[19:23] all over the world you've got in that
[19:24] one teaspoon
[19:25] everybody got that right so when you
[19:27] receive the new birth you get a dip
[19:31] you've got everything that the holy
[19:33] ghost includes right there in that
[19:34] teaspoon
[19:36] but now god wants to give you
[19:39] the whole ocean
[19:40] this is the whole ocean
[19:43] actually when we take a body change
[19:44] that's the whole ocean that's why
[19:46] brother dale's talking about the promise
[19:47] the prom the promise is the body change
[19:50] right that's our ultimate promise they
[19:52] couldn't receive that in the old
[19:54] testament they couldn't even receive the
[19:56] partial of the promise
[19:58] until they received the new birth
[20:00] but now see though paul says day without
[20:02] us but now paul become a day well now
[20:03] all those down do that they did receive
[20:06] part of the promise they received the
[20:07] dick
[20:09] but right here when we come to the end
[20:11] time
[20:12] jesus wasn't just a dip in the ocean
[20:17] he was the ocean
[20:19] he was the inexhaustible fountain
[20:22] he was the full ocean he wasn't a dip
[20:24] but now see when he come back on the day
[20:26] of pentecost he took little licks of
[20:28] fire
[20:30] and give it to 120 and then 3 000 and
[20:32] then we see the multiplication of god
[20:34] but now we've come down to the end time
[20:36] to where all those have gone on
[20:39] they're gone there's nothing you know
[20:40] paul can't help us anymore reading
[20:42] paul's writings can same way with
[20:44] brother branham he's gone but trusting
[20:46] what he's already said
[20:49] rapture and faith lays in the books and
[20:51] tape he didn't say oh he said in so it's
[20:54] not just writing it's not just reading
[20:56] what he said that's on the book
[20:59] but in the means inside inside there is
[21:01] a revelation that you're not going to
[21:03] have to come to and that's the same way
[21:05] with here
[21:06] that's why that this is one of the most
[21:08] ill-taught subjects in the message
[21:10] nobody talks about statue of perfect man
[21:12] they said oh you got it all when you
[21:13] believe well you do
[21:17] the teaspoon yeah
[21:20] of what all the elements you got right
[21:23] right but gordon's not satisfied with
[21:25] that or he just said okay now once you
[21:27] get that you're all ready to hear
[21:29] no he didn't waste space in
[21:31] second peter
[21:32] ii peter said add to your faith because
[21:35] brother brown said power without
[21:36] character we already been through this
[21:38] power
[21:39] you got the power
[21:41] power without these character virtues
[21:44] are satanic and you know what right here
[21:46] blasphemous names he said
[21:48] i'll read it in a little while i'll read
[21:49] it next sunday it says these virtues are
[21:52] a stumbling block to the unbeliever
[21:55] because if you're a christian
[21:59] and then you go out here
[22:01] and you throw a temper tantrum right in
[22:03] the middle of walmart
[22:06] now
[22:07] an unbeliever is going to look at you
[22:09] and go
[22:11] what are you
[22:13] what are you are you
[22:15] you're acting like me
[22:17] that's what i mean
[22:19] we gotta quit acting like the world we
[22:20] gotta try to act like god all right
[22:22] that's why these are godly virtues these
[22:24] are not man's virtues at all
[22:27] this has nothing to do with man once you
[22:29] enter into this kingdom
[22:31] once you enter into this kingdom
[22:33] the world shut out and god does this
[22:36] but now remember brother brown said you
[22:38] can stop them at any time
[22:41] you can stop these virtues at any time
[22:43] you say well i can't have temperance i
[22:45] just god just gets well you know what
[22:47] god can't help you
[22:48] so he's not going to override your free
[22:50] moral agency
[22:52] right up to the chains of the body he's
[22:53] still got to be a free moral agent or he
[22:55] can't judge
[22:57] righteously if he says that's why it's
[23:00] what you know a lot of these people say
[23:01] well i come here with eternal life
[23:03] that's okay in the mind of god
[23:04] absolutely but now when you come down
[23:06] here in your own body
[23:09] you're a sinner that's right on your way
[23:11] to hell
[23:12] right right
[23:13] god brings that representation down and
[23:16] burns out that old nature
[23:18] puts his soul in
[23:20] not brings you another one right he puts
[23:23] his soul in there and then you and him
[23:24] become vulcanized together and the only
[23:26] time brother around talks about
[23:27] vulcanizing is in the statue of a
[23:29] perfect man he said god vulcanizes what
[23:32] burns it together
[23:33] then you become a stature of a living
[23:36] god
[23:37] different
[23:39] act different talk different
[23:43] when i
[23:44] when you were talking about them
[23:46] what i say with them and and
[23:50] their baby in the situation they were in
[23:53] revelations 12.
[23:56] they overcame
[23:57] that fear and that demon that was trying
[24:00] to take their baby they didn't listen to
[24:02] those doctors they came right on the
[24:03] church and held their faith right
[24:06] just like a woman in in revelation 12
[24:09] yet let me finish my story there's a
[24:10] brother out there his name is mark
[24:12] stiebert and he comes he came to church
[24:14] but his mother's like 90 years old
[24:16] there's nobody he has no siblings
[24:18] nothing to take nobody take care of his
[24:19] mother so he has to care he don't want
[24:21] to put he chooses not to put in a
[24:23] nursing home he's going to care for her
[24:24] until she dies wonderful brother he
[24:27] watches online and he may be watching
[24:29] this
[24:29] later on because he called me after that
[24:32] crying like a baby
[24:34] he said i feel so ashamed
[24:36] he said those two came to church
[24:40] and their baby was dying
[24:42] and i can't come to church and my
[24:43] mother's laying here i mean she's not an
[24:45] envelope but she just can't care for
[24:47] herself he's 90. right
[24:49] so that really put a
[24:51] a burden on his heart to do you know
[24:53] trying to do better
[24:55] and and you know pay attention to what's
[24:57] going on
[24:59] in the godly realm
[25:01] not just the human realm but in the
[25:02] godly realm but uh but that really
[25:05] touched his heart he said i feel so
[25:06] ashamed
[25:08] and you do need to be in church you need
[25:10] to be where you can get your fuel
[25:12] this is a fuel this is my refueling
[25:16] i have to get refueled i i get empty
[25:18] real quick
[25:20] and i get hungry
[25:22] real quick
[25:23] go ahead real quick
[25:24] well my problem i feel ashamed i wasn't
[25:26] getting my life here and then she winds
[25:28] up there so i feel the responsibility of
[25:30] the team in the center
[25:32] and that thing
[25:34] that mental problem has got to go
[25:37] so i'm gonna go get what it takes to get
[25:39] rid of that
[25:41] watch what you got to do
[25:43] you got to present yourself a living
[25:44] sacrifice so that people will that's
[25:45] what i said about an example how are you
[25:48] going to be you're a stumbling block if
[25:49] you consider yourself a christian and
[25:51] then you don't act like it
[25:53] right right
[25:55] you don't act like it
[25:57] not only people around you did you know
[25:58] god sees it but the people around you
[26:00] see it it becomes a stumbling block
[26:02] that's what's happened in the past
[26:04] because i'm a christian i'm a christian
[26:05] i'm a christian then we act the way we
[26:08] do let's go
