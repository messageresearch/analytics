[9:36] [Music]
[10:00] [Music]
[10:03] service that was our first official
[10:05] service
[10:06] our indian church and then our good
[10:08] afternoon building
[10:12] beyond a man's camp
[10:15] but that's all back there that people
[10:19] would just can't
[10:19] die and they'd say to you how to use
[10:23] their own love to remember
[10:26] what truth were you of who you thought
[10:38] [Music]
[10:45] to do ever since then it's all working
[10:47] real good have been for 50 years and i
[10:49] thoroughly enjoyed it
[10:51] with all the heartaches and troubles
[10:53] that you could uh
[10:54] talk about it's just the point of
[10:58] being
[11:13] and he stayed headed to 1975 and i took
[11:16] over
[11:16] 75 against the pastor and moved on
[11:20] into the lord but the first service we
[11:23] had
[11:24] and i sure do hope it doesn't really
[11:31] first service we had we didn't have any
[11:34] parking in the back
[11:36] we had to park out in the front little
[11:38] store building
[11:39] [Music]
[11:40] no
[12:08] well then we finally
[12:20] let's just say one more verse
[12:23] you know one more before we leave
[12:27] well just as we started to sing
[12:30] here it came fighting right
[12:35] we have it on time
[12:39] [Applause]
[12:43] and he was filled up on prescription
[12:45] drugs and all that
[12:46] and the man that was chasing me down the
[12:48] street and
[12:50] he told us about it they were trying to
[12:52] stop him he was running like 85 miles an
[12:54] hour
[12:54] going in and out of the road he hit the
[12:58] first
[12:58] vehicle dead knocked it into the next
[13:02] vehicle
[13:04] there was five vehicles saying god
[13:08] he never wanted to total loss from the
[13:12] old
[13:12] car online but that afternoon
[13:31] that was the beginning
[13:46] continued on from god going and have had
[13:50] a good time
[13:51] that's all i want to tell you it has
[13:54] nothing to do a lot of people say oh
[14:15] but most of you know about it legally
[14:19] amen but we made it through all those
[14:21] years
[14:23] and laid it on this establishment
[14:27] and as i took over then my goal was one
[14:30] time
[14:32] to try my best to instill
[14:35] into the people the message
[14:40] the problem
[14:44] [Applause]
[15:04] [Applause]
[15:06] you just love the word if he said
[15:09] brother brown
[15:10] believed in one god
[15:43] [Music]
[15:57] [Music]
[16:06] is
[16:32] and the lives of people have tried to
[16:37] [Music]
[16:43] this virus has been through the land
[16:47] it never changed one thing in the
[16:51] i don't mean that good i made it back
[16:55] i mean it to the point that what it done
[16:58] you
[16:59] if you look like this
[17:17] but you're not going to settle down and
[17:19] say this message
[17:20] here
[17:23] you would blaze and didn't get to church
[17:26] before the virus struck you just lazy
[17:29] and god
[17:44] walmart
[17:57] has become
[18:10] for the word of god
[18:22] i thought christians were expected to
[18:24] have problems
[18:31] [Music]
[18:38] the greatest time we've had
[18:42] in 1969
[18:46] i tried my best to explain
[18:50] what your prophecy was saying
[18:53] that the pride of jesus christ would be
[18:58] the son of man
[19:01] in the last days that she be the
[19:04] fullness of the godhead
[19:05] right that's what your brother said
[19:14] i think it's the 50th anniversary
[19:17] but to me it's the 50th year of
[19:20] understanding and trying my best to
[19:22] proclaim the truth amen and get people
[19:25] to see it
[19:26] amen because that's what we're supposed
[19:28] to do i'm supposed to settle down in him
[19:30] and rest in him and let the word of god
[19:32] be
[19:33] and like i said how many of you have
[19:35] resonated you know the colors of the
[19:37] book
[19:40] well you're just an intellectual brother
[19:42] well if the intellect can brought
[19:43] preacher holy ghost then you need
[19:45] intellect
[19:47] but we know it can't right because it is
[19:51] the truth the holy ghost is guarding
[19:53] air and it's failed now in you
[19:56] if there's anything to celebrate today
[19:58] is one time
[19:59] 50 years of trying to preach one message
[20:16] i don't know
[20:21] i preached many many years ago
[20:24] mankind thought will be the end of the
[20:26] world
[20:28] [Music]
[20:30] those days now everything is running out
[20:33] yes so what are you going to do when it
[20:35] comes to the next one or you'll get you
[20:37] another one
[20:39] you'll find you another excuse for a day
[20:41] or a time
[20:45] see that's not christianity christianity
[20:49] is resting in jesus christ and allowing
[20:52] him to cut over in our lives
[20:54] and let him be the leader right we're
[20:58] not supposed to leave him he's supposed
[20:59] to lead us
[21:00] into
[21:07] [Music]
[21:42] well he's got his point right across all
[21:44] right
[21:45] so we're supposed to be ending up on
[21:47] time and then a celebration
[21:49] you know so for the old people because
[21:51] he has been
[21:53] brother points been anchored in this
[21:56] message
[22:18] i said you'll be preaching
[22:21] to them
[22:30] [Applause]
[22:48] didn't want somebody being young because
[22:50] they didn't understand
[22:52] i'm honest honestly saying that if you
[22:54] don't you young ones your young
[22:56] ministers
[22:57] sit down and listen
[23:02] listen to them explain and talk about
[23:04] the god
[23:08] when a man stops talking about the
[23:09] thought of his life and start
[23:11] talking about what he is in life that
[23:13] he's failed already
[23:16] see hello
[23:33] all right so you respect and honor it
[23:36] and listen to what is said
[23:38] well that's all we ask of anything so
[23:41] let's just go on into the service now
[23:43] and turn it back over to the job where
[23:44] you
[23:44] know the same wireless turn that over
[23:56] [Music]
[24:02] to say
[24:06] i've never tried to
[24:09] gain much ground in life
[24:13] because it's not much school we could
[24:16] have had a big
[24:18] monstrosity reveal and greater than this
[24:21] we could have had all kind of things we
[24:23] had the money
[24:25] but instead of doing that i chose to
[24:27] send it to the farm field
[24:30] to the mystery and let them
[24:35] have an opportunity you go over there
[24:38] you look at what they're living in
[24:47] [Music]
[25:01] always wondered how we could get the
[25:02] next guy
[25:04] well then they kept on coming with me
[25:06] and the brothers of the church said
[25:08] brother dale let's go on the internet i
[25:09] said no no
[25:10] no no no no
[25:26] you know
[25:55] i said because as quickly as i get on
[25:57] the internet the first
[25:59] phone call is going to be more out of me
[26:02] answering it because people are going to
[26:04] be calling me brother you're wrong
[26:06] you're wrong
[26:22] know me know one thing for sure i've
[26:24] been playing around
[26:26] but put your name on my value sent it to
[26:28] the world i've always said that
[26:30] i've always said let the messages go out
[26:32] who the name is
[26:36] i wanted the message to go forward
[26:39] that we've achieved that goal because
[26:40] we're in 168
[26:43] countries but they don't then keep up
[26:46] with all those things
[26:47] and all that we're in a big portion of
[26:50] the world
[26:51] is receiving the message from the little
[26:53] town of louisville georgia
[26:57] and that's what we want to do just
[26:59] finish the whole thing up
[27:01] one time and say it god is our god
[27:11] worship have a good time whatever they
[27:14] desire to do
[27:15] and they will go right on eating
[27:18] together
[27:31] it would work
[27:47] hard work all the internet and we sent
[27:50] it to the world
[27:53] if i could finish anything in my day
[27:55] life
[27:58] to give this message to the people of
[28:00] the world
[28:05] [Music]
[28:11] we walk in this world
[28:28] hours you realize what we buy
[28:33] you realize that martin luther you
[28:35] probably got a hundred dozen books that
[28:37] he wrote
[28:41] john wesley was more
[28:55] the world has an opportunity
[29:09] but then i believe

[1:16:46] oh
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:17:00] me
[1:17:02] i am
[1:17:28] is
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:56] oh
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:22] good to see you everybody
[1:18:36] first time i ever met brother samuel
[1:18:53] but maybe you've heard somebody
[1:18:55] testified about
[1:18:56] what the world looked like after 1973
[1:19:02] that was after world war ii
[1:19:06] and way after the civil war
[1:19:09] but we've got to save me and my wife
[1:19:20] and so then um
[1:19:43] and they were preaching
[1:19:46] i guess it was brother um
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:16] and after that
[1:20:20] we went up to visit little samuel
[1:20:27] and we got the uh
[1:20:53] and you can always tell the visitors
[1:20:57] when the training experience came
[1:21:02] because basically his eyes would get
[1:21:04] about this big
[1:21:06] and he thought maybe the train was
[1:21:07] coming through the door
[1:21:13] those were the good old days
[1:21:17] and i think that was probably where the
[1:21:19] most was the first person that they ever
[1:21:20] asked me to
[1:21:23] speak in public i don't know whether
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:42] and back in those days i was just in my
[1:21:45] opening prayer i mentioned jesus and
[1:21:48] cried for about
[1:21:49] 10 or 15 minutes and that's what people
[1:21:51] liked the most about
[1:21:52] with my crime
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:34] and so johnny asked his mom says mom can
[1:22:37] i go outside
[1:22:38] and play and you aren't you suggest but
[1:22:41] don't
[1:22:42] go across the street don't go to peter's
[1:22:44] house whatever you do
[1:22:46] you don't go across the street unless
[1:22:48] mama's out there okay no
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:17] justification is not to justify
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:32] in your life
[1:23:43] and i remember the brother gene collins
[1:23:46] funeral act i remember the book i have
[1:23:48] read
[1:23:50] about world war ii it was written by a
[1:23:53] man
[1:23:54] and his uh memories completed
[1:23:58] at war and he called it
[1:24:11] still are but we were so
[1:24:14] young when we
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:27] i was being challenged by the sound i
[1:24:30] run my hearing aids up
[1:24:32] running down running crosstalk
[1:24:36] a little bit challenged and then the
[1:24:39] lighting
[1:24:40] i was looking at at brother jewel and i
[1:24:43] was looking right at that light
[1:24:44] of course i couldn't see anything unless
[1:24:46] it had gotten away with the light
[1:24:50] and then when brother jewel came up
[1:24:53] i noticed his step whole
[1:25:05] it's funny how you look at that is when
[1:25:07] you get about 78 and 79.
[1:25:24] down
[1:25:28] but i'm glad to be here and i i consider
[1:25:31] it a privilege and an
[1:25:33] honor to be here basically at this
[1:25:36] 50th anniversary
[1:25:40] and so i i thought well what would be
[1:25:45] appropriate 50 you think a jubilee
[1:25:48] and i thought brother samuel
[1:25:52] by the
[1:26:02] and i thought well do you believe trump
[1:26:04] had always sounded on the day of
[1:26:06] atonement maybe we'd preach dale
[1:26:08] tournament and i thought well that
[1:26:11] wouldn't seem to be too appropriate
[1:26:13] and then there's always the independence
[1:26:15] day you know
[1:26:17] easter passover you know
[1:26:25] 50th anniversary and this may be a
[1:26:29] little
[1:26:30] out of place but my mind kept going to
[1:26:34] command
[1:26:40] and that might not seem appropriate
[1:26:44] but in some ways it is because it's
[1:26:46] christ and his church
[1:26:50] so i thought about
[1:26:54] a message i had preached a while back
[1:26:57] and actually the message came about
[1:27:01] by a message that brother julie preached
[1:27:04] at our church
[1:27:05] so i thought well that would be not
[1:27:07] appropriate
[1:27:09] because it actually brother jewel
[1:27:12] inspired me
[1:27:14] to preach a little series
[1:27:25] that was a few years back maybe 10 years
[1:27:28] eight years
[1:27:29] and if you're little that way back
[1:27:33] you know a long time ago
[1:27:36] and so anyway
[1:27:40] he'd come and preach the message for us
[1:27:43] on the end
[1:27:58] to brother jewel but but the holy spirit
[1:28:01] had given it for
[1:28:02] the jewel so then it became my property
[1:28:06] through inheritance
[1:28:10] anything that i preached that's revealed
[1:28:12] to you is yours
[1:28:16] because god gave it to him and man he
[1:28:19] can't give me a revelation i can give
[1:28:21] you knowledge
[1:28:23] i can't give you revelation
[1:28:40] so maybe we'd stand together and we'll
[1:28:43] take a scripture
[1:28:46] we will maybe we can turn
[1:28:50] to the book of isaiah
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:08] 55.
[1:29:34] this old house
[1:29:43] and uh it wasn't it was a few years down
[1:29:46] the line i didn't realize what the song
[1:29:48] was about
[1:29:52] that's like i remember hearing uh
[1:29:55] ankle bone joined through the knee bone
[1:29:58] and
[1:29:59] i thought that was some kind of a death
[1:30:01] scripture
[1:30:04] so i thought last night after everything
[1:30:06] and studied instead
[1:30:07] but i better learn the words to that
[1:30:09] song
[1:30:12] because the shutters ain't working just
[1:30:15] exactly right
[1:30:16] you know the door stays open too long oh
[1:30:20] i just want to tell you that
[1:30:21] that brother samuel and i
[1:30:24] have a license
[1:30:28] to preach long time
[1:31:00] friendship
[1:31:03] my wife used to warn me years ago
[1:31:06] she said now
[1:31:10] don't go up there and try to say
[1:31:12] everything you know
[1:31:13] in one night
[1:31:23] so in isaiah 55
[1:31:27] verse 8 for my thoughts
[1:31:31] are not your thoughts neither of your
[1:31:34] ways
[1:31:35] my ways save the lord
[1:31:38] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:31:41] earth
[1:31:42] so are my ways tighter than your ways
[1:31:46] in my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:31:50] and then i'd like to read another verse
[1:31:52] of scripture here in malachi
[1:31:55] beginning in chapter one
[1:32:00] the burden of the word of the lord
[1:32:03] to israel by malachi
[1:32:08] i have loved him
[1:32:23] maybe just
[1:32:41] these years
[1:32:44] to fulfill your desires to feed your
[1:32:47] sheep
[1:32:50] lord may you help us this morning
[1:32:54] our our hearts
[1:32:57] our lips our ears lord
[1:33:00] that you might furnish to your children
[1:33:04] to your lambs into your sheep this
[1:33:07] morning
[1:33:09] that's what they have needed to face the
[1:33:12] challenges
[1:33:14] of the day and the hour that we're
[1:33:16] living in
[1:33:18] may they leave here this morning with
[1:33:22] joy in their hearts and a greater faith
[1:33:26] they have when they came
[1:33:27] in we ask in jesus christ's name
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:36] now the reason why i chose this oval in
[1:33:39] scripture
[1:33:41] or it doesn't seem like it has a whole
[1:33:43] lot to do with this
[1:33:46] is that the way that god thinks
[1:33:50] and the way that god does
[1:33:53] things we don't always understand
[1:33:58] as much as we know about the word
[1:34:01] sometimes we as individuals
[1:34:05] may not understand all the ways of god
[1:34:08] and never will
[1:34:10] but one thing that i find that brother
[1:34:14] grant said
[1:34:15] that unless you know god's
[1:34:19] nature unless you know his ways
[1:34:22] you'll never understand his word
[1:34:26] and to know the word is not eternal life
[1:34:29] but it is
[1:34:33] to know the author of the word then we
[1:34:35] have a foundation where we can
[1:34:38] now understand his words
[1:34:42] so then i thought intimacy intimacy
[1:34:48] and the word intimacy of course means
[1:34:51] something that's
[1:34:52] private personal you think of an
[1:34:55] intimate friend an intimate relationship
[1:35:00] and and the way that we engage intimacy
[1:35:04] a lot of times is through
[1:35:08] our physical observances of one another
[1:35:13] uh i just take for an example hold
[1:35:16] hands that holding hands can be
[1:35:22] very intimate
[1:35:25] now brother wade was holding my hand
[1:35:29] when i came up because he didn't want me
[1:35:32] to go down
[1:35:33] early so
[1:35:36] that other way was kind of a caring hole
[1:35:41] so he but it wasn't what we would call
[1:35:43] real intimate
[1:35:44] yes where's the lord
[1:35:52] and so holding the hands
[1:35:55] uh i i think about my my grandson
[1:35:59] uh you know when when we get out of the
[1:36:03] farm
[1:36:04] little cody you know how children are
[1:36:07] when they're about three and four
[1:36:09] they're really kind of
[1:36:10] active you know and when you get out of
[1:36:13] the truck they're in the walmart you
[1:36:15] want to investigate everything really
[1:36:17] quick and run across and run this way
[1:36:20] and that's it
[1:36:21] now when we can't
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] and i remember one time we got out of
[1:36:37] the truck
[1:36:39] and i was getting out and i just pulled
[1:36:41] in the door and he walked over and he
[1:36:43] put his hand in one thing
[1:36:46] and that was a little bit more intimate
[1:36:49] now i wasn't in a jerk
[1:36:50] i was
[1:37:04] we talk about
[1:37:07] a young man a young woman
[1:37:12] and so in life you know
[1:37:16] one of the things that we
[1:37:19] cherish the most is designed to make to
[1:37:22] spend life with
[1:37:23] so when we can share life share
[1:37:27] experiences
[1:37:30] and so in maybe trying to
[1:37:34] find someone that would fill that
[1:37:40] we have what we call courtship
[1:37:43] now back in the day when i was out the
[1:37:45] world called it david
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:55] you know have a good time it was always
[1:37:58] a good time if a man had a girl a
[1:38:02] girl had a man and all that was
[1:38:05] but courtship's a little different
[1:38:07] you're not looking for just
[1:38:08] uh temporary employment
[1:38:11] you're looking for something down down
[1:38:14] the line
[1:38:16] so in courtship
[1:38:20] when my daughters were coming to that
[1:38:23] stage of life
[1:38:25] daddy becomes very protective
[1:38:31] with the girls
[1:38:34] everybody is suspecting to be a wolf
[1:38:41] and mama you know there's no woman
[1:38:44] that's good enough
[1:38:46] for a son so
[1:38:49] there's a lot of challenges
[1:38:53] and so in courtship
[1:38:57] there's a certain intimacy
[1:39:01] that enters into that relationship
[1:39:05] because now you're on a talking basis
[1:39:09] but no holding hands
[1:39:12] and anytime you all know anywhere junior
[1:39:15] or sissy's got to be with you
[1:39:21] don't stick don't sit too close in the
[1:39:24] truck
[1:39:33] or at least you have the permission to
[1:39:35] talk to him on the phone
[1:39:37] more write a letter and receive a letter
[1:39:41] so that's a certain intimacy
[1:39:46] because it's just changed from seeing
[1:39:48] somebody in the halls
[1:39:50] or on the street now there's an
[1:39:53] association
[1:39:54] and if that association continues
[1:39:59] then there comes the engagement
[1:40:04] and that becomes a more intimacy in the
[1:40:08] beginning it's
[1:40:09] more formal the man is trying to
[1:40:13] to show forth his masculinity and his
[1:40:16] attraction
[1:40:18] a lot of times what we see in the movies
[1:40:20] are on the middle boards of what they
[1:40:21] say
[1:40:22] the woman desires of a man so then
[1:40:24] you're trying to
[1:40:25] you know heritage crack
[1:40:31] like brother brown said i think it was
[1:40:33] if somebody was talking about little
[1:40:35] junior and his hair's all messed up
[1:40:37] and one day mom looks in there and
[1:40:39] junior's comb in his hair
[1:40:42] what the world's going on and so
[1:40:46] we always try to put the best foot
[1:40:48] forward
[1:40:49] we always try the best impression
[1:40:51] because this is the attraction time
[1:40:55] and so a lot of times what we go for
[1:40:59] will be what we call superficial things
[1:41:04] outward view outward attraction
[1:41:07] outward conversation
[1:41:10] but then when we move into the
[1:41:12] engagement there's a more
[1:41:15] a relaxing and then there's
[1:41:18] more intimacy
[1:41:29] and so there's a little bit more liberty
[1:41:34] and you know the first time you hold her
[1:41:36] hand
[1:41:37] or she holds your hand
[1:41:41] there's something very intimate
[1:41:56] you know there's indeed
[1:42:01] that's what we're talking about and as a
[1:42:03] relationship goes on
[1:42:05] you find that the conversation is more
[1:42:07] intimate
[1:42:10] so when we think of intimacy we think of
[1:42:12] those things
[1:42:14] we think of intimate friends
[1:42:18] what is an intimate friend it's somebody
[1:42:21] that becomes
[1:42:22] your counterbalance because intimacy
[1:42:27] also involves trust
[1:42:30] and so there may be
[1:42:34] a person that you have confidence in and
[1:42:38] you
[1:42:38] share your fears of life you share your
[1:42:41] secret struggles and sometimes we're
[1:42:45] disappointed in life because
[1:42:48] maybe it's shared with people that it
[1:42:51] shouldn't have been shared with
[1:42:54] so intimacy also speaks to
[1:42:56] communications
[1:42:58] the more intimate you with somebody the
[1:43:00] more confident you have
[1:43:03] and the more that you share with
[1:43:04] somebody
[1:43:07] now you take a husband and a wife
[1:43:11] that would be the ultimate intimacy
[1:43:16] because now there's that union that
[1:43:19] takes place
[1:43:22] but you know strangers that might sing
[1:43:26] that brother samuel is a real close
[1:43:28] friend of mine
[1:43:30] i would share things with him that i
[1:43:32] would not share with my wife
[1:43:33] right not because i'm trying to keep a
[1:43:36] secret trainer but because
[1:43:38] there's those things that men share one
[1:43:40] another and in the same way
[1:43:44] but the ultimate intimacy we would say
[1:43:47] would be a marriage between a man
[1:43:57] so intimacy with god how do we measure
[1:44:02] intimacy with god now we find a lot of
[1:44:05] times when we did
[1:44:07] i guess we still do that at the altar
[1:44:10] calls
[1:44:11] we find that one expression i want to
[1:44:15] close the wall what does that express me
[1:44:20] i want something i want a more intimate
[1:44:22] relationship
[1:44:26] and we watch people in church and praise
[1:44:28] and worship and
[1:44:30] you know you say well i just love god so
[1:44:32] much well
[1:44:34] how will you express your love for him
[1:44:36] he's a spirit we can't grab
[1:44:38] hold of him and so then i
[1:44:42] i thought about this i thought intimacy
[1:44:46] god's intimacy and god
[1:44:49] you know he doesn't think like we think
[1:44:52] right
[1:44:52] we find in these two scriptures
[1:44:56] that in the in the first scripture he
[1:44:58] lets us know that the way that he judges
[1:45:01] things
[1:45:02] the way that he looks at things is not
[1:45:04] the way that we judge things
[1:45:07] even if we're religious
[1:45:10] so you must be born
[1:45:13] now what happens when you're born again
[1:45:18] then that soul that is in you
[1:45:22] is quicker
[1:45:25] and it's not so much a little person in
[1:45:27] christ comes and gets inside of you
[1:45:31] but the life that was in christ is now
[1:45:34] resident within you
[1:45:37] and that's what we call the mind of
[1:45:40] christ
[1:45:42] because that just sets us in order now
[1:45:46] that we can grow into the kingdom of god
[1:45:48] and wisdom
[1:45:50] knowledge and understanding
[1:45:53] we can't receive the things from god
[1:45:55] unless we have the spirit of god and
[1:45:58] that's not the spirit of god
[1:45:59] honest it's in us
[1:46:03] and then now we can receive those things
[1:46:07] that god
[1:46:08] freely gives to each and every one of us
[1:46:12] so that begins a relationship with him
[1:46:17] intimacy intimacy god's
[1:46:20] intimacy so let's turn if we will
[1:46:26] i'd like to go to genesis chapter 5
[1:46:32] and this is where i draw from
[1:46:35] from what brother jewels preaching
[1:46:39] and from my studies
[1:46:43] uh i've taken a series on enig
[1:46:47] as the bride of christ
[1:46:50] and i hesitate to say that he was a type
[1:46:56] of the bride of christ the living
[1:47:00] that is to be translated is not a type
[1:47:03] of the bride that's going to sleep that
[1:47:05] will come up
[1:47:06] resurrection
[1:47:21] and it may be wrong i say that enoch
[1:47:24] was the first fruit of the translating
[1:47:28] bride
[1:47:31] because his life was so such a parallel
[1:47:36] noah was a type of 144
[1:47:39] 000 and he was the type of the sleeping
[1:47:42] virgin
[1:47:44] because his life was a little bit
[1:47:46] different he was carried across the
[1:47:48] judgment
[1:47:49] but when enoch is different he was
[1:47:51] translated
[1:47:54] and that's different than elijah because
[1:47:57] elijah was translated
[1:47:59] but it didn't say that he wouldn't see
[1:48:00] death right
[1:48:07] over there in the middle east because it
[1:48:09] said
[1:48:10] that he was translated that he wouldn't
[1:48:12] see that
[1:48:14] so they we are translating that remain
[1:48:31] and he wasn't just the type he was
[1:48:34] translated
[1:48:35] that he wouldn't see that so let's read
[1:48:37] about in just a minute
[1:48:39] in genesis 5 and verse 21.
[1:48:43] enoch lived five years
[1:48:48] and he had methuselah
[1:48:51] and he walked with god
[1:48:54] after he didn't get assumed
[1:48:58] 300 years and be dead sons and daughters
[1:49:02] and all the days of enoch were 365 years
[1:49:08] and he walked with god and he was not
[1:49:13] god took him
[1:49:17] so this is interesting because
[1:49:20] anything is 65 years old
[1:49:25] before he walked with god
[1:49:30] now he has a child
[1:49:33] and we find him walking with god what
[1:49:36] what caused this
[1:49:38] because this certainly is a change in
[1:49:41] relationship
[1:49:43] because he's not an unbeliever it's not
[1:49:45] that he's getting born again
[1:49:48] because he's up to the leading coming
[1:49:50] down from the set
[1:49:52] and the man began to call on the name of
[1:49:54] the lord as far as we know
[1:49:56] offering sacrifice according to
[1:49:59] revelation
[1:50:01] so he was going to church but now
[1:50:04] something that happens into his
[1:50:06] life that elevates him into a
[1:50:10] intimate or more intimate relationship
[1:50:14] with god
[1:50:17] 65 years old
[1:50:20] and he's a believer but now
[1:50:23] something happens into his life right
[1:50:26] and now he's in a more intimate
[1:50:30] relationship because he's walking with
[1:50:33] god
[1:50:34] and listen it's not because he's invited
[1:50:36] god to walk
[1:50:48] so god was expressing an
[1:51:02] [Applause]
[1:51:04] and
[1:51:14] i'm talking about you
[1:51:20] 65 years old now he's walking with god
[1:51:26] in the old testament there's only two
[1:51:28] people
[1:51:29] that walk with god interesting enough
[1:51:33] it was any canola
[1:51:37] they were kings that walked after god
[1:51:42] abraham uh was told to walk before god
[1:51:48] daniel was beloved of god but it never
[1:51:51] said he walked with god
[1:51:53] so this is interesting at the end
[1:51:56] time any
[1:52:00] walk with god what caused
[1:52:04] this change in intimacy
[1:52:07] and how can i measure intimacy
[1:52:13] so let's if we will let's go to
[1:52:17] jesus
[1:52:25] in hebrews 11 i'm sorry and verse 5
[1:52:31] now remember each of these subjects in
[1:52:34] hebrews 11.
[1:52:37] it's not talking about a common
[1:52:39] relationship
[1:52:41] but when it says able by faith
[1:52:45] often have a more excellent sacrifice
[1:52:48] we're talking about
[1:52:49] abel's experience and the things that he
[1:52:53] was doing
[1:52:57] and so when i'm talking about enid this
[1:53:00] scripture is going to be revealing
[1:53:04] of enid and what he was doing
[1:53:07] amen it's not talking about able it's
[1:53:09] not talking about abraham
[1:53:11] they may have some things in common but
[1:53:13] this this is a testimony this is a
[1:53:16] record this is a
[1:53:17] biology you can put it that way
[1:53:22] so it says by faith
[1:53:25] was translated so the first thing we
[1:53:28] find out
[1:53:30] that his translation was as a result
[1:53:33] of his faith
[1:53:38] so what i don't tell me about it tells
[1:53:40] you a whole lot
[1:53:43] hebrews 11 and 1 tells us
[1:53:46] that faith is the substance
[1:53:51] of things hoped for
[1:53:56] anything that i learn in the scriptures
[1:54:00] is true from genesis to revelation
[1:54:04] so any time i find faith
[1:54:08] it must first come to you
[1:54:12] as whole because faith is the substance
[1:54:16] of things hoped for
[1:54:20] and hope the prophet says i believe it's
[1:54:22] in the
[1:54:23] adoption series he says hope is an
[1:54:26] intellectual
[1:54:27] faith
[1:54:30] hope is something that you've read
[1:54:32] something that you've seen
[1:54:34] something that you've heard something
[1:54:36] that you believe
[1:54:38] and i find there's two types of poll
[1:54:42] hope begins in the intellectual realm
[1:54:45] in the spoke words original see he calls
[1:54:47] that the womb
[1:54:49] yeah and so would you say
[1:54:52] intellectual hope never
[1:54:55] perceives on the faith
[1:54:59] but it dies in the mind
[1:55:04] but there's a hole that is of god
[1:55:09] that goes on to be faith
[1:55:12] and faith is the substance of things
[1:55:14] before
[1:55:17] so before enoch had his faith
[1:55:20] he had a hope okay right
[1:55:24] but then hope becomes right
[1:55:28] during this program
[1:55:32] people committing suicide
[1:55:36] why well they got to confine the house
[1:55:40] of course i've got a little cabinet
[1:55:42] people yeah
[1:55:46] because they can't go out and go
[1:55:47] shopping they can't go to parties
[1:55:50] whatever life is about them because now
[1:55:53] they're sometimes
[1:55:55] within the perimeters of their home
[1:56:26] brought salvation to us so it's a matter
[1:56:29] of you accepting what god
[1:56:31] has given to his son christ so we're not
[1:56:35] hoping to get saved like catholics and
[1:56:38] different drugs
[1:56:39] they're hoping when they get to the
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:51] of his glorious appearing that blessed
[1:56:53] hope that is set before us the second
[1:56:56] coming of christ
[1:56:59] now in romans 4 when we're reading about
[1:57:02] abraham
[1:57:04] it said to abraham
[1:57:13] so in other words there's two holes
[1:57:17] one hope is based on things that he's
[1:57:20] seen that he heard
[1:57:21] maybe his hope is built on science
[1:57:26] because up to a certain point in life he
[1:57:28] believed god
[1:57:29] because god said him and sarah were
[1:57:32] going to have a child
[1:57:34] and up until that time that he would
[1:57:37] still have children but now he had come
[1:57:39] to a time
[1:57:41] that nature had declared that he was
[1:57:43] past that time when
[1:57:44] sarah was past that time all right so
[1:57:47] then
[1:57:48] his whole like jacob uh
[1:57:52] that hope that he had through science
[1:57:56] was no more right but the hope that he
[1:57:59] had
[1:58:00] that he believed god that hope
[1:58:04] was greater than the hope that man has
[1:58:06] in his natural being
[1:58:11] and then it goes on to say not being
[1:58:14] weak
[1:58:15] and safe now that's interesting
[1:58:19] because here he has hope
[1:58:22] and this hope is based on god's word
[1:58:26] and he believes that he's going to have
[1:58:28] that child
[1:58:30] but somewhere hope
[1:58:33] turns to faith because now
[1:58:36] faith says it disregards it doesn't even
[1:58:40] acknowledge the condition
[1:58:42] of his body and sarah's body because
[1:58:45] faith
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:03] but that hope must become faith brother
[1:59:06] said hope
[1:59:07] is faith worst enemy
[1:59:10] when we were a child we talked as
[1:59:13] children
[1:59:13] we played with things that was
[1:59:15] challenged but then when we became a man
[1:59:18] so hope has its life because you can't
[1:59:22] have faith
[1:59:23] without hope but there has become a time
[1:59:27] that when hope becomes faith
[1:59:31] in genesis 18 brother brown
[1:59:34] calls it the sun man experience the son
[1:59:38] of man repeating himself
[1:59:41] now it's interesting because in genesis
[1:59:44] 18
[1:59:44] 1 that when abraham
[1:59:48] sees these strangers he recognizes the
[1:59:51] lord
[1:59:52] right away
[1:59:57] this is the son of man revealing himself
[2:00:00] all right
[2:00:01] amen and immediately after this
[2:00:05] experience
[2:00:07] their bodies were changed
[2:00:14] to this experience becomes faith
[2:00:19] so hope is one thing
[2:00:22] but then love gives us experience
[2:00:38] and it's interesting if you read hebrews
[2:00:41] 11
[2:00:42] 11 because it said through faith pharaoh
[2:00:45] also
[2:00:48] now up until that time it was by faith
[2:00:51] by faith by faith
[2:00:52] but when it comes to sir it says through
[2:00:54] faith but sarah
[2:00:56] also receives strength
[2:00:59] and that word strength is dues
[2:01:03] it's a supernatural power
[2:01:06] it's
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:21] why because she believed that he that
[2:01:25] made the promise
[2:01:26] was able to fulfill that
[2:01:31] so now abraham has moved from hope to
[2:01:35] faith
[2:01:37] but sarah is still in hope
[2:01:40] he's saying why do you say that because
[2:01:46] when god was instructed her and she was
[2:01:48] behind in the tent
[2:01:50] yeah he says
[2:01:53] you and sarah are going to have this
[2:01:54] child i'm going to visit you according
[2:01:56] to the time of life
[2:01:58] and she within herself
[2:02:01] behind the tent
[2:02:12] and he said why did sarah laugh
[2:02:16] and say within
[2:02:29] can you imagine in determining
[2:02:33] and looking at her eye
[2:02:36] and said yes she did
[2:02:42] now something happens because she was
[2:02:45] laughing
[2:02:46] that's whole she might have believed but
[2:02:48] she didn't have to say
[2:02:49] but now she realizes that this man
[2:02:53] is not just a man but it's god in human
[2:02:56] flesh
[2:02:58] because
[2:03:04] and if you notice from that time
[2:03:08] sarah had faith and her body also was
[2:03:12] changed
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:20] the son of man experience represents
[2:03:23] translating faith to bring us to a
[2:03:26] translation
[2:03:29] because it was genesis 21
[2:03:32] before god visited her
[2:03:35] and by divine
[2:03:39] intervention
[2:04:08] when we need to stop by faith enoch was
[2:04:12] translated that he should not see
[2:04:14] death and it was not failed
[2:04:18] that tells me somebody was looking for
[2:04:20] it
[2:04:22] because you cannot be not found unless
[2:04:24] somebody
[2:04:25] was looking for you now i'm not talking
[2:04:29] about anything i'm talking about you
[2:04:33] his wife was looking for him the mayor
[2:04:36] was looking for him
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:50] for his translation
[2:04:54] he had this testimony
[2:04:57] that he pleased god and i heard somebody
[2:04:59] preach one time that he was going around
[2:05:01] telling everybody he pleased god
[2:05:03] and what you need to do is go around
[2:05:05] telling everybody you please god
[2:05:07] but i believe your testimony is your
[2:05:10] life
[2:05:12] the greatest
[2:05:17] is the life they live and if you don't
[2:05:20] have a live black and you're preaching
[2:05:22] this void
[2:05:23] empty it's tinkling symbols and veils
[2:05:26] it's just times in the wind
[2:05:30] amen
[2:05:33] so he had a testimony
[2:05:37] that he pleased god and without
[2:05:40] faith it's impossible to please him
[2:05:45] for he that cometh to god must believe
[2:05:49] that he
[2:05:49] is and that he is a rewarder
[2:05:54] of them in
[2:05:58] the diligently seeking so that tells me
[2:06:01] now
[2:06:02] he was seeking the presence of god
[2:06:08] and i thought
[2:06:11] he was the only one that had translated
[2:06:15] faith out of
[2:06:16] all the generations of the first one
[2:06:19] right they weren't
[2:06:20] evil it was the children yeah
[2:06:23] that began to mean but the first foreign
[2:06:26] lineage that came down
[2:06:28] it was
[2:06:43] but jesus said and let your
[2:06:46] righteousness
[2:06:47] exceed the righteousness
[2:06:50] so then your faith must exceed
[2:06:54] the faith
[2:06:58] because they had faith they had faith
[2:07:01] for a resurrection
[2:07:03] and a translation but they did not have
[2:07:06] faith for a translation it wasn't needed
[2:07:09] at that time
[2:07:11] amen that's right
[2:07:14] so it says the lord descended with a
[2:07:16] shout with a message
[2:07:19] and that message was for what it was to
[2:07:23] provide
[2:07:24] rapturing
[2:07:27] because romans 10 tells me it's
[2:07:30] impossible to have
[2:07:32] faith without first the word of
[2:07:39] the god of the word of god now faith is
[2:07:42] not hearing the word of god
[2:07:45] right because everybody that hears this
[2:07:48] morning may not walk out with more faith
[2:07:52] right you may not receive anything
[2:07:55] but faith cometh by the hearing of the
[2:07:58] word
[2:07:59] so that tells me that abel that he
[2:08:02] would know that abraham god
[2:08:06] had to provide word before they could
[2:08:09] have faith
[2:08:11] and it had to be hulk before it became
[2:08:14] faith
[2:08:14] there was an experience
[2:08:22] so then he had a testimony
[2:08:26] his life pleased god and without faith
[2:08:30] it's impossible to please him
[2:08:34] and he was seeking him i thought what
[2:08:37] caused
[2:08:39] what caused him to begin to seek god
[2:08:44] why didn't he say that he didn't call
[2:08:48] the name of god
[2:08:49] until the end that's interesting
[2:08:54] and so then they began to call on the
[2:08:56] name of god
[2:08:57] in other words they were going to church
[2:09:00] they were offered up to sacrifice
[2:09:04] and they were living by all the words
[2:09:07] that they had
[2:09:09] because remember adam was never called a
[2:09:12] prophet
[2:09:13] abel was the first one listed as the
[2:09:17] so prophet prophet has the word of the
[2:09:18] lord so if i go to jews
[2:09:20] jew tells me that he didn't prophesy
[2:09:25] amen so evie was a prophet
[2:09:43] after john ate the book what's the
[2:09:46] central attraction
[2:09:48] of revelation 10 the angel no
[2:09:52] the seventh agent no it's the book
[2:09:58] that's what the focus is is the book
[2:10:01] the angel came down with the book
[2:10:05] and it was given to john to eat because
[2:10:07] it was
[2:10:08] his inheritance in that book
[2:10:25] so now we find that you as the bride of
[2:10:28] christ the living bride
[2:10:31] also has a prophetic message
[2:10:36] now the secret things belong to the lord
[2:10:39] but those things that are revealed to us
[2:10:42] now belong to us into our children amen
[2:10:53] jesus we find that abraham was called a
[2:10:57] friend of god
[2:11:00] i think it's in truly old testament i
[2:11:02] think it was chronicles
[2:11:04] and another book in the old testament
[2:11:07] he's called a friend
[2:11:08] isaiah and then in jace james calls him
[2:11:12] to god and in genesis
[2:11:15] god was speaking to abraham he said
[2:11:17] should i
[2:11:18] hide anything
[2:11:21] that i shall do from abraham doesn't
[2:11:24] call him friend
[2:11:26] but jesus said i don't call you servant
[2:11:31] i call you friend now a servant
[2:11:36] has a certain intimacy or relationship
[2:11:39] with the master that the people on the
[2:11:41] street know
[2:11:46] sometimes people might approach brother
[2:11:49] brother i always think brother dale i
[2:11:52] always said that the first name
[2:11:54] first name you know dale samuel no that
[2:11:57] ain't right it's samuel dale
[2:12:00] but it seems like the first thing you
[2:12:01] all have two first names somehow
[2:12:04] so if they want to talk to daddy who are
[2:12:06] they going to go to they either going to
[2:12:08] go
[2:12:08] to wife or something and it's not
[2:12:11] because they're interested in the sun
[2:12:13] they're interested in that right
[2:12:16] influence
[2:12:17] pulpit whatever it might be
[2:12:20] so we finally said i don't call you
[2:12:23] servant i call you
[2:12:24] friend so now there's an elevation
[2:12:28] from servant friend because sin we know
[2:12:32] is a more
[2:12:32] intimate relationship so now god is
[2:12:36] giving
[2:12:36] us an insight as to what intimacy
[2:12:40] involves he says i call you friend
[2:12:44] because everything that the father told
[2:12:46] me i told you
[2:12:48] now we find that intimacy on
[2:12:52] god's heart is measured by
[2:12:56] revelation amen
[2:13:00] yes revelation of prophecy
[2:13:04] this is to be an intimate age
[2:13:08] right eating had an
[2:13:11] intimate more intimate relationship
[2:13:15] than any other person in that age other
[2:13:18] than possibly norm
[2:13:25] and this is the bright age
[2:13:29] it's the same one that they call the
[2:13:31] church down through the ages because
[2:13:32] it's one body one church
[2:13:35] but when she was in the infant stage
[2:13:38] then she was in the
[2:13:39] young woman age now she's in the miracle
[2:13:51] so this is the most intimate age between
[2:13:54] god and the church
[2:13:56] in this last age
[2:14:11] always represents prophets and prophets
[2:14:14] represent prophecy so this is an
[2:14:17] age of not the making of prophecy
[2:14:21] but the fulfilling time
[2:14:25] god is elected he's elected
[2:14:28] not only in his love jacob of my love
[2:14:33] but because the seed that
[2:14:36] uncreated soul that was part
[2:14:42] and jacob was thirsting
[2:14:45] for god so that part of god
[2:14:49] became the birthright but he was not
[2:14:52] satisfied with the birthright it is
[2:14:55] when he met the angel amen
[2:14:59] that his life was changed
[2:15:02] from jacob to israel
[2:15:06] the woman at the well was seeking eating
[2:15:10] was seeking
[2:15:11] you were seeking all right
[2:15:14] he was seeking god the woman if you will
[2:15:18] was seeking god
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:34] your spirit tried to interpret the
[2:15:38] language
[2:15:39] of the soul all right
[2:15:41] [Applause]
[2:15:43] then your soul was thirsting for god
[2:15:48] and the spirit said you need to go to a
[2:15:50] party
[2:15:52] the spirit said they could understand it
[2:15:56] it could hear the noise but it couldn't
[2:15:57] understand what the soul was saying but
[2:15:59] it knew that it wanted something
[2:16:01] and you need a center of it
[2:16:09] so the woman at the well was seeking god
[2:16:12] she was seeking that stability she was
[2:16:15] seeking
[2:16:16] that comfort
[2:16:30] cheater
[2:16:58] right
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:12] religions
[2:17:14] but now she's in the presence of the
[2:17:16] word himself
[2:17:18] and he is standing there he's positioned
[2:17:21] himself in such a way
[2:17:25] that it creates a conversation
[2:17:28] because now he is wanting to reveal
[2:17:30] himself
[2:17:32] to her
[2:17:38] so you were seeking but it wasn't so
[2:17:41] much that you found him
[2:17:44] but it wasn't he positioned himself
[2:17:48] in front of you for a conversation
[2:17:54] in just a few minutes under that
[2:17:56] ministry
[2:17:58] she went from segregation
[2:18:01] i'm i'm a samaritan
[2:18:04] you're a jew
[2:18:21] if i give you this drink something
[2:18:25] right not jesus but the spirit god was
[2:18:30] dealing with her
[2:18:33] and she went from one end of the
[2:18:35] spectrum
[2:18:51] comes the church hey what's going on
[2:18:55] we're gonna have a good time
[2:19:04] because
[2:19:18] i remember he was you he was seeking god
[2:19:24] and he was seeking him diligently
[2:19:28] because the scripture tells me he was
[2:19:31] what caused him to do that
[2:19:34] i remember years ago 30 years ago
[2:19:38] 20 years ago we had a sister in our
[2:19:41] church
[2:19:42] she was an older lady
[2:19:45] and like me now not then
[2:19:48] she liked to talk and
[2:19:52] she had been in her rounds and meetings
[2:19:56] and she would tell this one particular
[2:19:58] meeting she was in and there was
[2:19:59] wheelchairs all up and down
[2:20:15] for this one and then you go over and
[2:20:16] pray for this one about time he got over
[2:20:18] there
[2:20:19] by time he got to the end of the world
[2:20:23] everybody that was in the eye all this
[2:20:28] stupid then the next time we have coffee
[2:20:31] and little church gathered she started
[2:20:33] following it again
[2:20:36] and then she said again
[2:20:56] become
[2:21:08] he tells you about oh i can remember
[2:21:10] back
[2:21:12] now we have evidence that that that adam
[2:21:15] had testified
[2:21:17] when he talks about the ministry of his
[2:21:19] son noah he talks about the land being
[2:21:22] cursed
[2:21:23] right and how the noble's going to bring
[2:21:25] peace rest to the people
[2:21:26] now how did he know the lamb was cursed
[2:21:29] when god
[2:21:30] cursed the land in the garden of eden
[2:21:32] not outside
[2:21:34] so then that information had to be
[2:21:36] brought out by
[2:21:37] abel so he must have been testifying
[2:21:42] also that cain and abel listen to the
[2:21:45] testimony
[2:21:46] of their father what taking place in the
[2:21:49] garden of eden
[2:21:50] and from that testimony god inspired
[2:21:53] abraham
[2:21:54] i mean that abel offered up the
[2:21:57] sacrifice
[2:21:59] so one day he thinks
[2:22:03] you know there must be more than just
[2:22:04] going to church and
[2:22:06] singing songs
[2:22:15] so he's sitting in the coffee shop one
[2:22:17] morning with all the other brothers
[2:22:19] in there he starts at all
[2:23:17] today you know that's the scripture that
[2:23:21] eve felt
[2:23:22] right but she didn't believe that he was
[2:23:24] the same yesterday right today
[2:24:07] is seeking the presence of god then
[2:24:14] if he's going to reward him
[2:24:17] what's he going to do with let him meet
[2:24:19] the church
[2:24:20] his wife
[2:24:25] he's going
[2:24:49] and an atheist is self-made there's
[2:24:51] nobody that's born in
[2:24:52] atheism there's nobody born and agnostic
[2:24:56] there's nobody born a christian we're
[2:24:59] born infidels
[2:25:01] we're born an idolater i believe in good
[2:25:04] luck
[2:25:04] bad luck oh this was my this was my
[2:25:08] lucky knife
[2:25:09] i had those when i killed at that 14
[2:25:12] point
[2:25:12] buck perhaps when i go hunting this year
[2:25:16] i'll have my lucky knife with me and
[2:25:19] i'll shoot another one
[2:25:21] what have i done i am attributing
[2:25:25] supernatural power to this
[2:25:28] piece of metal
[2:25:32] good luck bad luck is idolatry yeah
[2:25:37] we are holding a supernatural force
[2:25:41] with that item or with that tradition
[2:25:45] or ritual yeah
[2:26:14] somewhere and when you're driving down
[2:26:16] the road and that black cat runs
[2:26:31] was now searching and seeking
[2:26:35] for the presence of god
[2:26:44] something more than church what was it
[2:26:47] that
[2:26:48] the son of man experienced projected
[2:26:51] more than trained for the sick raising
[2:26:53] them right
[2:26:55] it was something peculiar
[2:26:58] to guard it wasn't just one of the gifts
[2:27:02] of the spirit
[2:27:03] this was a personal identification
[2:27:07] of god alone amen that was
[2:27:11] projected through a man the son of
[2:27:16] himself through flesh
[2:27:19] in the days of jesus christ it was
[2:27:22] sinless flesh
[2:27:24] god and man this
[2:27:27] generation he was born through a man
[2:27:30] revealing to you the presence
[2:27:34] of the living god vindicated
[2:27:37] that what this man had to say god
[2:27:40] approved us because he was
[2:27:56] received a visitation
[2:28:00] from god because he's a reward
[2:28:04] and when he came to him he
[2:28:07] had seen the complacency of the church
[2:28:13] he had seen the children now beginning
[2:28:16] to
[2:28:17] intermingle with cain's children right
[2:28:22] like we're preaching on that for a while
[2:28:23] but we're moving
[2:28:29] he saw the deterioration of the church
[2:28:32] the laxity of the church
[2:28:34] now the intermingling of the church and
[2:28:37] remember
[2:28:37] it was finally broke the camel's back
[2:28:42] when god said live a little longer
[2:28:47] 120 years yet that was
[2:28:50] after that they begin to god
[2:29:03] and god said that's it amen
[2:29:10] being a prophet because if he prophesied
[2:29:13] that means he had the word of the lord
[2:29:16] was a prophet he said you can speak
[2:29:18] against me
[2:29:20] but you're speaking against the word of
[2:29:22] the lord i become the word of the lord
[2:29:25] and because you speak against the word
[2:29:27] now listen
[2:29:28] he received the word when he was out
[2:29:30] there just a minor
[2:29:31] armor he didn't even own any man he was
[2:29:34] just a
[2:29:35] sycamore just like a minor charm
[2:29:39] then his daddy wasn't a problem then no
[2:29:42] king
[2:29:43] nothing but god elected to reveal to him
[2:29:46] the word
[2:29:47] and what came to eat it and healing was
[2:29:50] a prophet he prophesied
[2:29:55] so then god must have revealed
[2:29:59] prophetic truth and he said
[2:30:03] enoch what you're seeing is the truth
[2:30:08] it's absolutely
[2:30:11] my mind the condition of the church
[2:30:15] the condition of the condition of the
[2:30:17] world
[2:30:20] you're going to have a son
[2:30:24] and you're going to name that son
[2:30:28] because the word methuselah means that
[2:30:31] when he dies
[2:30:32] the delusion comes the flood will come
[2:30:35] the judgment
[2:30:39] any bill procurement
[2:30:43] he may not understand it but but thy
[2:30:46] divine revelation that he built it
[2:30:50] and it was never capped off
[2:30:53] that was the second bible so enoch
[2:30:56] wrote the second bible by inspiration
[2:30:59] not even understanding right about it
[2:31:02] he didn't have to understand it he just
[2:31:04] did what god told him
[2:31:06] he had a testimony he had a ministry
[2:31:10] he prophesied all the way to the second
[2:31:14] coming of christ so edie's ministry
[2:31:18] reaches all the way to the bride that's
[2:31:21] living
[2:31:22] as the second coming of christ she will
[2:31:25] be preaching the same message he
[2:31:27] preached
[2:31:29] same spirit yes
[2:31:35] and he had a sign yes
[2:31:41] and from that time when he had that baby
[2:31:46] and he named that baby
[2:32:08] it
[2:32:16] she has to know the mark of the beast
[2:32:19] yes
[2:32:20] or how can she use this and everybody
[2:32:22] has
[2:32:27] yeah she has to recognize she's in the
[2:32:30] tribulation
[2:32:31] how will she know that people have been
[2:32:33] saying we're in the tribulation period
[2:32:35] we've got people among
[2:32:36] us that's in the millennium walking
[2:32:39] around
[2:32:42] the bride has that message
[2:33:01] i'm not talking about knowledge
[2:33:05] prophecy
[2:33:08] believe create hope
[2:33:12] and hope as expectations
[2:33:17] if you're hoping to buy a new car and he
[2:33:20] said well if i say
[2:33:21] fifty dollars a month i can buy this
[2:33:23] apartment x amount of time
[2:33:25] so your hope and your expectation
[2:33:28] changes your
[2:33:30] financial reactions in your life
[2:33:35] so prophetical word influences
[2:33:39] and brings full hope brings expectation
[2:33:43] expectation begins to mold our character
[2:33:59] i was talking to a young minister
[2:34:01] several years ago
[2:34:04] and he had started a church
[2:34:07] in a house and the people in the church
[2:34:11] were mostly pentecostal
[2:34:12] right off the street and they've been
[2:34:16] pastors for a couple
[2:34:18] years two years three years still in the
[2:34:21] home
[2:34:22] still had about the same amount of
[2:34:24] people
[2:34:26] and they were still dominated by other
[2:34:29] pentecostal thoughts traditions and ways
[2:34:33] and so i was talking to him
[2:34:41] where he had the services now
[2:35:09] they understand the seventh seal you
[2:35:11] understand the son of man
[2:35:16] so i could see this by talking to him
[2:35:20] and so i said you know
[2:35:26] success is not in the size of the church
[2:35:32] it's not in the building
[2:35:36] it's not how deep the church churches
[2:35:41] so how is success
[2:35:44] measurement
[2:35:47] and i told you success
[2:35:50] is measured in the heart
[2:36:06] as far as i can i can't bring him and he
[2:36:08] got frustrated with him
[2:36:10] and he's been going out preaching a
[2:36:11] little bit oh he got all of them
[2:36:14] oh great message you got back home
[2:36:16] listen if you can preach it for home
[2:36:17] church you can preach anyway
[2:36:22] everything you'd reach here whole 50
[2:36:24] years you can think about the number of
[2:36:26] your sermons right
[2:36:27] number 10 oh that was a good one
[2:36:30] number 25 whoa that one was deep
[2:36:33] you know that's the way the
[2:36:40] so success is not measured in the
[2:36:43] outward things
[2:36:45] but that brother
[2:36:48] samuel been a successful pastor
[2:36:52] measured in the heart
[2:36:56] it's mentioned in your heart
[2:37:01] this man had gotten tired and you're
[2:37:03] going to go to another church
[2:37:05] somebody he could leave
[2:37:09] so does it does it leave brother dale
[2:37:12] with bitterness
[2:37:13] do you see business i've tried to teach
[2:37:15] this
[2:37:16] church and there's
[2:37:30] do when a man decides to be a farmer
[2:37:34] maybe he's got an office job so he goes
[2:37:38] out there and he said i'm going to be a
[2:37:39] farmer he starts
[2:37:41] working on the farm how do
[2:37:45] starts to things weight his muscles
[2:37:48] begin to tone up
[2:37:49] now he ain't pumping iron and going down
[2:37:51] to the goal of the journey
[2:37:54] he's out here working he's laboring
[2:37:58] and in that laboring his his body's
[2:38:00] changing
[2:38:02] he's in the sun he's getting the sun
[2:38:04] he's going down to the beauty salon
[2:38:06] turning on the lights something's
[2:38:10] changing when he's laboring something
[2:38:13] changes in his heart and even if either
[2:38:16] becomes embittered
[2:38:18] or it begins to grow in sympathy
[2:38:27] when you leave the compassion look how
[2:38:28] they treated me
[2:38:31] you know that's not success hi
[2:38:36] martin wasn't successful after those
[2:38:38] first 40 years
[2:38:50] success is
[2:39:08] of your people pray that you have said
[2:39:12] something worth
[2:39:14] you can take universe to an individual
[2:39:22] one little drop of water you can open up
[2:39:24] a flooding
[2:39:25] river oh god
[2:39:29] you can do much with little and man
[2:39:33] seemingly doesn't live with much so may
[2:39:38] you
[2:39:38] take these words multitude of words
[2:39:44] and may it be may it be a live stream
[2:39:48] maybe a water of early land
[2:39:53] a lateral early ladder together
[2:39:58] made your people leave here
[2:40:02] with the happiness of fellowship yes of
[2:40:04] light
[2:40:05] kindred faith and brothers and sisters
[2:40:09] that have been sanctified by truth
[2:40:13] separated from the world through faith
[2:40:17] and may there be some that was brought
[2:40:20] last night
[2:40:21] and today and through the song may you
[2:40:24] minister
[2:40:26] to your people yes
[2:40:29] lord we need you more than
[2:40:34] without you we can do nothing
[2:40:39] and anything that we can do without you
