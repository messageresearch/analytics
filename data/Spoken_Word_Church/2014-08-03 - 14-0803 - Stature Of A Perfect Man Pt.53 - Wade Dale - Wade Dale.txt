TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's correct all right we're going to read finish reading some that we were reading last week on brotherly kindness together good afternoon hello there we go all right you gotta know yep okay let's get back to Statue of a perfect man and let's read this and then make some comments on it because we we gotta mold this from brotherly kindness right up into and next week try to try to go over that green I didn't want to get maybe it was the Lord not letting me get the dream until you got to get to the very part where it says holy spirit because that brother Ram said that was the honey so you gotta understand what the honey is to understand what that Holy Spirit is right here not a different Holy Ghost than you receive right right not a different one but it is a different manifestation of that Holy Spirit this puts you in the body this didn't put you in the body you're in the body here you're not putting the body twice right right you're putting a body down here at Faith you're a Christian you're a Believer you're you're born again you're bride all right but God don't want you to stay baby this is baby down here this is baby faith this is not Babyface this is mature faith right this is God working in Paul Peter James if you want to see what you want to see what the real acts of the holy spirit is it's supposed to be in the end time go to the book of Acts and see what the faith of the fathers which is right here the faith of the promise which was Paul Irene called Peter James Paul all the all the disciples and the apostles that were living in that first church action all right so that's the characteristics of what we have to get to and it's like brother Brown you know we we went back and he showed that that the true Act of Brotherly kindness was there in the book of Acts when everybody sold everything gave it to one head and then they distributed it and there was no grumbling because the only two that grumbled died okay I don't know since so far the only two that grumbled about the whole situation they died so God got rid of them in a hurry God may not physically kill us now but definitely people are spiritually dying which is worse then sexually let's add the Bible saying here adding Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and that's a good one right here the six seven all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in this place on the matter now you're saying my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day Jesus said 70 times seven all right 490 times yeah seven times what's good but not that one it's 490 times probably kindness now you see it for Brothers All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with it I remember what we said excuse me last Sunday brotherly kindness to me brings in all the virtues because you've come invited that one more time we'll throw this thing oh that's temperature I just want to see if somebody but brotherly kind of spreads an all together patient hey everything because it culminates right here is where the ceiling in is going to be of the virtues all right so you come up to brotherly kindness you better have all these working because somewhere down in here you're going to know whether you got brotherly kindness or not or I mean up here you're going to know what you got brother kinds because of what's what he says right here someone said not long ago how can you believe these things you do and still go the Assembly of God in one it's all the rest then put see brotherly kindness see see hoping someday patient with him temperate knowledge to understand what he believed remembers in his heart virtue he's named pretty much all the virtues below that having faith that someday God will bring him in okay brother Reynolds and brotherly kindness and he's tapped on the chalkboard all right see that he goes back and then he jumps right in and says next thing he says add charity the Capstone he's talking about the why not get into the uh brother Dale's been speaking of Enoch been the Zodiac coming and Enoch was a pyramid come out to Pyramid Navy of course when he drew the picture he had to put when he drew that picture he had to put something behind it to show that pyramid was something to deal with and then he talks about the dollar and he talks about the pyramid like they said there is a pyramid teaching that's totally off the wall but there is parts of that pyramid that was if Enoch built that pyramid according to the Bible then they are something about the stones there is something about the the the placing of the rooms and the seven steps and the three chambers and the upside down there's all something to do with that but it's all in a type of me and you it was it was not a reality God didn't want to live in a pyramid right but he did there wasn't enough word and actually there wasn't enough that any of us weren't there you'll make that manifest so we're here now looking back and we can see the pyramid teaching and we say that is it's okay it's all right to study it and look at it I really enjoyed that brother Clark did an in-depth study on it and he showed that that pyramid you know it looks all Jagged but when it was first built it was built with the stones and then there was casing stones that were polished and they were put on the outside of that pyramid so the pyramid was slick and when the sun come up it radiated the sunlight out and it supposedly you could see it for two three hundred miles all right there's no Shadow either that's it that's amazing that it was geographically put where there was no Shadow to me I don't I don't know I don't see I can't see how that happened with the sun coming up and the thing would be sticking up like this there's got to be something but you have to go about what they say but the thing that got me was is there's exactly 144 000 that man from that number familiar there's exactly 144 000 casing stones in that pyramid and they were tore off during the years and dispersed in all over the world well guess what same thing with the Jews they were dispersed all out there's 144 000 going to come back and they're not a total part of this pyramid but they do get the Holy Ghost okay they do get the Holy Ghost I mean they don't have to come up the pyramid like we do but they do get the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that we get all right so that was kind of strange but it wasn't strange knowing that 144 000 is going to be saved and that all that 144 000 casing Stones were done away with and to keep to bring the pyramid back you're gonna have to bring them 144 000 back so that's good all right let's go on up a little bit further you don't like the pyramid now look I got 328. sorry it's hot in here but nobody thought of it now in the building the virtue of building this Monument building this stature now remember it's not a statue little words mean things it's not a statue a statue is you can't move a statue a statue has no virtue noise temper so statue is just a statue but a stature is high or growth development and you read your Bible your Bible will tell you stature of a perfect man okay building this Monument building this stature Scene It starts off with the foundation stone Faith virtue and all this temp for the face of Godless public kindness now what does it do then you're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir right in here right in here see I got in between all these Works in here little waves now in the original chart and we had one a long time ago I don't know if Daddy still got one or not but in the original chart there is waves coming right down through here brother Brown Road in the original chart there's waves coming up there okay now what he explained was he said the holy ghost coming down through Christ seeing holy spirit so what it comes to is you bring now the holy spirit is above all this welding this together building a what a perfect church for the Capstone and cap at all so the church is going to be perfect before the cap comes on the cap doesn't come on to make it perfect the cat comes on to make it complete right right everybody understand that the cap comes on to make it complete not to make it perfect being perfect is when this comes right here and it takes and if there's any cracks it's silver okay so I mean we still may have we still got a problem even with a Capstone you got a problem yeah about complete and all right watch this right here the holy spirit is above all this welding This Together building a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off so it's got to be a perfect Church show the Capstone can come on because the Capstone is perfection that is Jesus Christ himself okay that's that's what we mean that's what the world has missed and it's only happened two times in history and I believe that we've got you know we've got to all come to that if we're going to come to the body change but brother Brown and Lord Jesus Christ were the two greatest examples of being a perfect man and then that Capstone coming down on top of it which is adoption this is not adoption from here to here this is adoption got it The Headstone is adoption not all these others sure there's a lot of times you can be heard God will expect you to do things he will say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased as well but he will not say here you him until that Divine love or perfect love comes down on that perfect church or perfect person um not a good little brother brown but it was in last week brother Brandon okay if brother Brandon came to that Capstone why did he not take a body chain because he was a prophet of the age and the prophet of the age he prophesied himself brother Brown said they can't be two of us here at the same time so guess what brother Brown I'm wanting God but God is God so he prophesied his own death he knew that he knew I believe he knew it a while he was going to have to leave yeah the reason he had to leave is because of that because God said I'll not share my glory with nobody I'm going to come and campus they want no there wasn't no two or three jesuses on the earth at one time and all there was one Jesus he was the prophet he was the man he that wasn't no other savior there wasn't no other Redeemer he's the only one and brother Branham understood that headship and he said okay I'm here because remember listen to what the angel said on the river the angel said on the river your message will forerun he didn't say you will he never says you will forerun he says your message will forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ so brother random knew I don't believe he knew there on the river but as he got older in his in his walk with God he knew that there was a point in time that he was a prophet so he prophesied things and those who prophesy must die because they're prophesying of someone to come all right because the great one came then me and you have to come we weren't there The Headstone can't come down on a total body like we were talking about last night until everybody comes to their place okay everybody's wanting to find the last one well the last one may be sitting in a church for 10 years and not be born again but all of a sudden when that brother or sister gets born again it's done because you can walk in sanctification for you know years years and years and years okay everybody got that so brother Branham came to adoption because I believe that's the only way the seals could break because Jesus preached the seals they broke he preached six seals they broke to them to him not no one else then you had brother Brown come and when he came the seals were broke to him when he went out to Arizona now the seals went broke to him out there but God identified where he was when he said in other words this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell hear ye him because he told Brother around me he said go back to Jeffersonville it'll be revealed to you those seals see they didn't reveal him nothing to him out in Arizona right that was just a scene that was just a scene those angels didn't tell him nothing listen those angels couldn't tell him anything everybody wants to think that the seventh one was him and the sixth one was was Luther Western none of them people knew a thing about even brother Brown from that point back didn't know one thing about the seal right I said not one thing and I meant when I called the book closed sure you could look to a glass Darkly you could see and prophesy of something to come but that bug was in the hands of the original owner not William Brown right right it was in God's hands and the only one who could open the book brother Brown said the only one who can open the book is a lamb okay but we know the lamb was in brother Branham just like the Lambs in you okay the Lamb's in you the same as it was in brother Reynolds but he fulfilled an office an office that was fulfilled that that you know he said he changed my life and it did because I see that then he saw I see that he saw that was when his message really started and he tells you many times he said it's not in the Years this is years of preparation that's right yeah everybody say that this is this is a year from from the Holy Spirit down to Faith that is the 2000 year preparation from when Jesus the Capstone was here he was the Capstone but remember he can't cap the church because you and I weren't there he's got to have that end time bribe that's why I said that that Abram can live all the way up through here I hope some you got that maybe we want to do it again because I some of you didn't understand just thought it was a good story but Abram Abram come up through here Abram walked through justification sanctification Matthew in the morning he told Abram to walk before me and be thou perfect that's right did you know not Abraham he said Abram walk before me and be perfect when he got his name changes when everything honed down to where Abraham knew what was going to happen who it was going to be by and when because remember God said I'll visit you according to the time of life so he knew according to the time of the cycle of the woman in the time of the nine-month pregnancy he knew within that nine months he was fixing to produce that child and he was going to produce it to Sarah so he had it wasn't it went and follow us on Holy Ghost uh baptism it wasn't you know eternal hell you see what I'm saying Abram may have been caught up in a lot of that but Abraham was not Abraham finally knew okay I'm going to have this child by Sarah promised child and my name's been changed to Abraham so I'm a different person something's going to happen because at 99 I can't do it so he knew at the point and that's why I believe brother Branham he he comes on the spoken words Original season which is pretty simple what 62. and he says the pure unadulterated word struck the Earth he thought it had from their back the period but the message because remember the Holy Ghost said pick up your pen and write as of yeah Malachi Force he broke around thought he'd already fulfilled those and he preached the seals as he thought he preached he preached took the Loose Ends and tied them all together no eternal hell water baptism what happened in the garden all the doctrines that we that we continue to go you know we over and over we talk about but see that's just years of preparation listen that just got the church back to where Paul was you understand that that just got the church it had fell away so much through the church ages right here Church ages it had been eaten so much to the church ages of man's ideas Mass doctrine that brother Brown remember the Alpha and Omega He restored the faith of the fathers which was in the first church but that wasn't brother Brown's message but he had to bring that message so that this welding this together he had to build a perfect Church it didn't mind if it was only one that was him he had to build a perfect church and so the Capstone could come on top of it brother Brown at that point if he preached a wild horse rider was the Holy Ghost that was error God corrected it and from then on it was pure everybody got that right so he came to bring the pure message the perfect message and a lot of people they don't they they they they they're wrong when they do this when they say oh 47 to 63 he was so wrong can't believe him but after 63. no sure we had levels of understanding from 47 to 63. that was he was growing in Grace and now it's just like you and I do but when you come to 1963 sure God sharpened that pencil of that Prophet because you come up to here and brother Brown says okay I was this was wrong I was thinking this I was thinking that all during that seals that week what God was doing God was just remember Michelangelo when he got when he got to Moses he wasn't finished when he got finished he still had to polish it because there were some rough edges on it right right you still have to when you build anything build cabinets or anything you build these cabinets you put them out and you say well that's done no you got to sand them Barney some paint them so the finishing touches have not been put on the body brother Branham come his message from 47 to 63 did bring a stature yes to here yes right that's what it brought it brought back the faith of the fathers remember Malachi 4 says restore the heart of the children to the fathers in other words the children The Babylon Pentecostal baby children 1906 Isuzu Street he brought that group of people well he didn't bring back I'm not coming individuals I'm talking about they probably want nobody understood what he said but it was for you and I that had come out of Pentecost our Baptist our Methodist or whatever you want to say we had to come out come into this message and then from 47 to 63 is your foundation but it's not just a foundation right this is the building that's right they only want a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off once it done again it's manifested to seven churches and seven Church Messengers started back here where was the church first founded Paul first aid Ephesians 8. second a Smyrna virtue irenius the great man who held the gospel call and he goes through all of them didn't come in brotherly kind and stood the layout of sin and we believe the great message of the second hearing of Elijah in the last day shall sweep the land all right now watch look right here that's a paradox because laodicea means people's rights layout of seal means totally opposite from anything brotherly kindness is Broly kindness is gone in this age people listen but but not for a group of people that's in this age that has the new birth that's trying to live the best they can and trying to live a Godly life it is probably kindness in the loudest CMH but but the rest of the world is mayonnaise no brother kind so what it does it enhances more if you have brotherly kindness it shows more got it everybody got it shows more you know if you were living in an age that everybody was sweet and loving you know you just lived you couldn't shine you couldn't overcome that's what I was thinking about something last night maybe coming home from um Bible study it's it's an awesome time to live yes it is it's an awesome time but it's but it's one of the worst it's the worst time to to try to be a Christian but remember he that overcometh overcome what but you got to overcome it doesn't matter you put whatever in it cause your battle ain't my battle and my battle ain't sure about a battle but it's like I was telling Jim when people start getting sick I'm honest I'm sorry when people start getting sick I let backslide what's the first thing you do what's the first thing you do you all y'all done you quit Church you quit coming that's totally opposite in what you should be doing right totally opposite but see the devil wants it to be that way now sometimes we're sick and we can't help but I know that but what about our spiritual life people disappear for a month or two why they backside when it should be see that's not overcoming unless they come back that's not overcoming that means they never had anything to start with right if they leave and don't come back they didn't have it that's right okay they didn't have what they thought they had okay but then in the Bible talks about he that overcometh to get here on time on Sunday is an overcoming staying at home just because you gotta you know your cat's got diarrhea where's the overcoming part now I can read in the scripture where it says he that overcometh it's like a situation happened just the other day and the Bible says that if you can't take correction you're a pastor child now he doesn't say if you take correction I mean if you don't take correction because you believe he was right then all these stipulations the Bible says you don't take correction you're a master job period and don't say well if you feel good that day or even as brother random I don't know if it's in here but I know he's got there's one quote where he says even if you're spoken ill toward but if it's for correction and you don't take it your master child what I mean there's no stipulation if you don't take correction you're not a child of God period right period there's no stipulation of well I felt good that day or or John was you know John was feeling good and not feeling bad and and he corrected me and I got mad and stayed away from church or stayed home or whatever you know put your situation in there but you got to overcome that the Overcomer is the one that's going to win because the Bible says the last overcoming there's remember the Bible says there's I mean you see preachers say the seven overcoming because there is seven churches they're heated overcoming but there's eight overcoming go to Revelations 21 or 22. it says he that overcometh shall receive all things you have to overcome there yeah this is coming these right here is like um Monique of them's dad said one time he said these are Trials of life that's what Trials of life is going to perfect this right here I mean how are you going to have a Temperance if nobody mad at you how you gonna have patience if everybody's on time and everybody no you got to have an overcoming there's an overcoming part to this that's true he's an overcomer it gets all these promises it doesn't say the one that that slacker Slackers don't get don't get overcoming okay what I was just saying when we get sticky and get offended instead to me it's when we haven't been praying and reading our Bible like you know when you do a lot of that you just things just roll off you it takes care a lot of them it sure does so whose fault is it it goes right back even though you spoke guilty how do you react back to that because if that person speaks ill to you he's going to have to give an account for speaking ill to you but he's like Daddy said though if the guy tells you the truth because people that you know that this is my whole point as long as as long as brother Dale's talking about everybody else's problem I'm fine but when he starts talking about my problems then he's the one that's got a bad attitude you know when he talks about y'all y'all say that's wonderful man preaching brother God bless your heart just preach it just just learn that thing out but when he starts talking about me I go live he that he's doing that in a bad attitude you know hello is anybody human in this room yeah I told sister Glenn we were talking about it today she said it's about being sweet I said I've never been sweet so I'm consistent consistent I'm just gonna stay this way I'm consistent I'd rather have somebody consistent than being up and down I think it's a Christian you you if you're an overcomer if somebody talks to you and in a bad tone and you know you take it as correction it doesn't really offend you your feelings could be hurt you realize why am I doing it right that's like brother Dale you know he he every sermon to me is a correction sermon because we're sheep we need to be correct here now it may not be so much as one person but we all need to be more diligent praying and reading our Bible Well if he says well if he says that then we shouldn't all get offended right we should say uh-huh that's right you know because you know that's what your problem is that's right like I said Freda said if you don't read your Bible and don't study and you know what has happened to me I know what's happened to you that's right you lapse in time and let something get in your way and you don't read or study for a week or two hello for a week or two we've all done it let every life get in the way all the time the attitude comes afterwards right bad ones mostly we get a bad attitude why because we haven't stayed inside that little uh we haven't said the right Comfort do I yeah the right dog that's correct amen bro that's right all right go ahead Amen brother okay so we'll stop right here we'll start here oh absolutely just see how you yeah how you react that's right so who's so who's the winner the one that reacts the right way yeah to see how you react now that's pretty something if God allows somebody to say something to you now whose Perfection is that for yours not the person that says it it's for your Perfection all right let's go we might get number 12
